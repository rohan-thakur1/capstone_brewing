2358,"2017-05-17",3.6,"Bottle from Beers of Europe, drunk in the comfort of my own dwelling. Its a deep brownish amber, clear with a magnificent off-white head. Lovely aroma: cherries, a touch of cinnamon, some glorious resinous esters. Sweet taste at first but the hoppy bitterness creates a barrier of dryness. Chocolate berry notes with an almost patchouli note in the aftertaste. Carbonation is extremely high. A magnificent creation.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"
2358,"2017-03-23",3.0,"Piana obfita, średnio trwała. Barwa herbaciano brązowa, klarowna. W aromacie karmel, orzechy, masło, herbata i dojrzałe owoce tropikalne.

2358,"2017-03-17",4.0,"12oz bottle from eden prairie liquor with commonmac during March madness. Murky red brown with off white head. Sugar and hop nose. Thicker sticky body. Resin hop, malt, rich, some bubble gum, and very slight biscuit cracker. Some grapefruit as well. Very bitter, but in a good way. Definitely a better way to do a red ale. Dont have to be a rocket scientist to know this is a good beer.","Minnesota, USA","commonshawn"
2358,"2017-03-17",4.0,"Bottle acquired at Eden Prairie Liquors and consumed during Day 2 of March Madness with commonshawn. Assertive hop aroma from the onset with resin, grapefruit, and other citrus notes. Attractive darker amber color with a light tan head (roughly a quarter finger). Taste is an interesting combination of seemingly multiple styles. There is an overarching bitter hop note presence but malty, caramel, toffee qualities act as much more than supporting actors as the sip progresses. Almost a background bourbon barrel characteristic that probably goes along with the alcohol bite coming through. Citrus rind bitterness and pine resin sticks around and dominates the aftertaste. Hard to classify this one as an amber ale...much more like a red IPA. I dont like space but I like this rocket fueled effort.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"

Taste more or less follows, some grapefuit as well. Dont remember the menthol from earlier, brings down the taste a bit. Nice bitterness on the palate in the finish, fairly smooth for medium body and carbonation, maybe a little overcarbonated. Still longing for slightly less hoppiness, and just a bit more malt character, but nevertheless one of the best red/amber ales Ive had.","Turku, FINLAND","TeijoA"

2358,"2016-09-27",4.2,"[ ASPECTO ]
 La Red Rocket Ale presenta turbidez por frío que desaparece al alcanzar temperatura de servicio. Se muestra entonces brillante y límpida, lo que permite apreciar su precioso color ambar-cobre. La espuma tintada en color vainilla es muy cremosa, de abundancia media y bastante persistente, y presenta una buena adherencia y notable carbonatación.

 [ EN NARIZ ]
 Notas de Cata Red Rocket AleDe intensidad media y complejidad media-alta, las primeras notas en nariz son tostadas de caramelo, crema quemada y pan ligeramente tostado. A continuación y enseguida vienen las herbales y especiadas del lúpulo, con algo de pimienta y el picor de la hierba recién cortada, así como un punto azufrado con quizá algo de col de bruselas. Las notas predominantes vienen de los especiados y tostados.

 [ EN BOCA ]
 En cuanto a los cuatro gustos básicos (dulce, salado, ácido y amargo; dejamos de momento de lado el umami y otros), presenta un amargor marcado que parece provenir tanto del tostado como del lúpulo, dando como resultado un amargor sabroso y muy agradable. Buen equilibrio con el ligero dulzor de caramelo tostado, pero manteniendo la predominancia del amargor.

 Respecto a la sensación en boca, es de cuerpo ligero-medio, textura ligeramente chispeante y de un refrescante muy agradable. En boca se crece y el amargor lo domina todo sin sofocar las diversas notas. El caramelo quemado está siempre presente y las notas herbales aparecen después de un rato en boca. Con 6,8% ABV, la sensación alcohólica es baja a moderada.

 La persistencia es bastante buena, media-alta y el amargor no resulta astringente, por lo que se hace agradable todo el tiempo. Tras cerca de un minuto, es el caramelo quemado el que se apodera de tu lengua y paladar, casi como si estuvieras chupeteando una cuchara con la que hubieras preparado caramelo en la sartén, aunque mucho menos dulce.

 [ CONSIDERACIONES GENERALES Y MARIDAJE ]
 De trago medio y una muy considerable bebestibilidad, la Red Rocket Ale es perfecta para tragos largos si tienes sed. No sólo te hidratará, sino que te dejará una fantástica sensación en boca.

 Su amargor marcado pero no avasallador la hace perfecta para aperitivos de intensidad media, y para carnes ligeras y medias, como pollo especiado, cerdo o ternera. Adecuada también para ensaladas sabrosas.

 [ OPINIÓN PERSONAL ]

Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon/orange peel, light pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon/orange peel, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/citrus peel/grassy bitterness; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon/orange peel, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and minimal hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, that increases through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth moderately sticky/creamy/bready balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding hoppy red ale. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink.

A scotch ale-ekre általában jellemző barley wine-szerű illatok tehát ez esetben is erősen munkálkodnak, az imperial stoutokra jellemző szivárványszínű összetettség egy efféle darabnál is megfigyelhető kissé visszafogottabb és komlóközpontú formában.

Strong pine and spicy hops (jalapeno and black pepper) hit first with an almost resiny quality (even though they arent *that* high), but then this is overtaken by a sweet, caramel and toffee malt flavor (how often does *that* happen?).  This further evolves into a heavier molasses like flavor along with a light tobacco/bacon smokiness thats delicious.  The hops then seem to surge back at the end, ultimately leaving a fairly dry bitterness behind.  There seems to be a lot going on in this beer which I didnt expect from the brewing specs.

2358,"2012-03-12",3.8,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/17/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

This is much darker than I would normally expect an amber ale to be. The color is a full crimson ruby color with amber edges, with a modest eggshell cap that relents to a collar.

The nose is full of caramel malt first, toasted grains second, and a blend of pine and citrus hops third. 

The strong toasted grain and sweet caramel malt cannot prevent a strong bitterness from entering the flavor up front. Sweet and bitter work together, with the hop flavor becoming more noticeable toward the end. Lots of prickly pine, with some juicy citrus as support. This beer is strong on every front.

The body is definitely on the fuller side for the style, with the carbonation coming in on the lighter side of medium, but it all works. There is a stickiness from the malts and a light resin from the hops. 

Everything I have had from Bear Republic has been well done. It would be difficult to find an amber that I would prefer over this one.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Candied fruit, toffee and floral hops on the nose make for a similar aroma to that of a sweeter bitter or English strong ale. The similarity vanishes upon tasting the beer, however. Initially midl floral hops build up into a crescendo of floral, spice and lime hop flavours. These give way to a sweetly malty body, with fruitcake and toffee notes which linger in a nicely fruity finish.

2358,"2011-02-08",4.0,"Pours a dark translucent red, with plenty of foamy off-white head that laces a bit on top, but not much otherwise. Aroma is intensely tropical, with loads of mango on the nose before anything else. Smells like mango lassi almost, with the mango augmented by the malty sugary sweetness. Taste is a change of pace, as it initially is coarse and leafy hop-bitter, but then reverts back to the sugar-sweetened mango, which then fades to a clean, bitter, raw-leaf ending. Hop bill is very balanced here, and the finish is nice and smooth to add to the drinkability. Mouthfeel is very coarse, with my enamel taking a beating right now, but it is good all the same. Drinkability is helped by the finish, but also by the light body and texture of this beer (which isnt to say its thin - it isnt - but that it is very light for such a full bodied and flavorful brew).

2358,"2011-02-01",2.3,"I tried to bring this up in points but failed in my efforts. Maybe it was my bottle, then maybe not!  Into a fluted chalice, cool not cold. Pours hazy and muddied by a lot of greyish globules of yeast that fail to dissipate but do manage to settle out. Sloppy, lax, soapy off-white head is mostly lasting. Body seems almost still aside a few brave bubbles, deep brownish copper in colour. Big, bright hop nose; floral, citric and earthy with hints of apricot, peach, pine needles, toffee and wood, the husks of roasted peanuts and a hint of the alcohol. American hop dominated palate, no surprises there. Sharply bitter, too aggressive for balance, the minimal malt notes just drown underneath. Subtle hint of Anzac biscuits and ripe oranges in the acridly weedy and earthy swallow. Holds some nasty phenols too, rubber, burnt plastic, lonely smoke. Mild bite of carbonation upfront in the void of flavour zone, this has it all in the back where it does smooth out in mouthfeel only to be up-heaved by the clashing flavours, esters and phenols of the finish. The body is relatively light for something I assumed was an American interpretation of a Scotch Ale. Oh well, I guess a re-rate some day down the track is fair. Until then!!

The caramel malts standout. Gives it a mild molasses nose. Hops are very much in evidence. Dark clear brown with good head and persistent lacing. Not at all sweet, certainly bitter, not fully rounded, I am guessing it is on the flat side due to lack of any salt - that is just a guess.

Aromas of roasted grains, grapefruit hops, and caramel malt.  Taste is more of a barleywine, and tastes boozy, much more boozy than the ABV would lead you to guess.  Heavy on the hops, mainly citrus and grapefruit.  Middle of the taste profile was caramelly, finishing really bitter with some notes of flavored tobacco.  Not bad, in fact its really good.

2358,"2010-12-05",3.6,"12 ounce bottle. Poured into Bruery tulip. 

Off white, cream colored head dissipates relatively quickly leaving only few clusters of foam atop the beer. 

Essentially inexistent lacing. 


Pours very dark for a red ale (ie, when looking at full glass it appears dark brown like a stout or porter). When held close to light, hue is deep orange/ruby-ish brown shade of amber. 


Plenty sediment throughout with the largest chunks of light ash colored sediment falling to the bottom of glass  first have seen in a red or imperial red ale (then noticed it is noted on side of bottle: Brew Master Notes: real ale is alive, yeast is good). Almost as much sediment as some Belgian golden strong ales (eg, La Chouffe as a recently drunk example). 

Piney hops is primary aroma, caramel malt scent is secondary. Slight earthiness on nose. Pleasant and well balanced aroma. Seems to have very subtle hint of tobacco with perhaps even less of a hint of bitter chocolate.  


Hops on front palate. Caramel malt on mid palate begins to balance out hops. Malt is slightly less sweet and less caramely than other reds/imperial have recently tried. Back of palate and finish are very well balanced; especially the finish as compared to some other red and imperial red ales have had recently, which had quite hoppy finishes. Just a touch of alcohol on the finish. 

Highly quaffable. Mild mouth feel. Almost sessionable expect that it nears 7% abv.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"

Flavours are big, and lightly bitter, nice round spiciness to the hops here, reminds me quite a bit of Arrogant Bastard Ale, with the toffee paired well with the bitterness.

Taste of sweet caramel reminiscent of a barleywine, nice hoppy bite with plenty of malt to go around, toasty grains, and fudgey chocolate are here too. The body is unbelievably smooth, creamy, and leaves a nice toasty caramel and hops linger. I cant imagine a beer having a much better texture than this.

Flavor opens with a blast of C hops and moves into a sweltering bitterness of citrus rind, grapefruit . The malt is bready and sweet as the hops turn a bit spicy and herbal. The carbonation gets this beer moving and allows the caramel to shine and be sticky without making it too full bodied. Overall well balanced and drinkable with a great personal signature on the flavor profile. Very enjoyable.","Ohio, USA","cracklefish"

The aroma is rich with pine, caramel, grapefruit citrus and vinous malts. There is also a peppery overtone accompanying the nose. Initially, the flavour is dominated with bright citric notes and toffee sweetness. The aftertaste though brings out a spicy bite that is reminiscent of rye malt. The finish is dry, roasty and somewhat coffee-like. The palate is medium bodied and sticky in texture, especially in the finish.","Ft. Riley, Kansas, USA","unclemike"

There was also a hop presence, heavily focused on pine with some grain too.  It had a somewhat cloudy dark copper-amber color with an average-sized foamy tan head that had shorter retention and moderate cling.  The beer had a sweet caramel malt flavor with some underlying grainy bitterness, and only a touch of sour character.  A wet, drinkable beer that was smooth, but very lively with its carbonation and full on the palate.  A solid ale that fit its style well.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"

Aromas are very nice... quite a bit of sweet malt caramel and the like with a good dose of hops mixed in... pineapple and oranges seem to be the main hops aromas.  First reaction is that mouthfeel is thick and kind of dusty/grainy.  This strikes me even before the flavors are detected.  As for the flavor, however, things are much like the nose predicted.  Maybe a little more of a grainy sweetness up front and maybe a little bit of a sharper pine bite in the finish.

2358,"2009-01-06",4.3,"Style and Glass: American Strong Ale, Trappist; Snifter
ABV, Volume & Calories: 6.8 % in 22 fl oz. estimated at 300 C
Purchased at: Canals Lawrenceville for $1.66 ($19.99 for a 12 bomber case on special)

Aroma: nice, cocoa, heather, hay, flowers, leaves, musty, musk, dark roast malts.

Visuals: exciting packaging, like a lighter flavored chocolate stout, brown to black, fully opaque, staying rocky tan head, sticky intricate lace.

Taste: chocolate malts, more towards malt than hops, focyus on aromatic hops, some bittering hops finish, delicious.

Palate: milky, peppery carbonation, wash, surf, medium finish.

Overall: Amazing for the special price. Ill have it about 11 more times at least. Id like to pair it with something like pizza, broccoli, garlic chicken, soy, beans, lots of possibilities there.

2358,"2008-10-10",4.0,"Appearance: This ale poured a rich mahogony with a gorgeous, rich thick pillowy head. As I swirl the beer in my tulip glass, the head continues to refresh.

Aroma: I am a bit surprised that there is not a greater intensity. The beer smells fresh and green, but doesn’t possess a huge aroma.

Taste: The first flavor I notice from this beer is a slightly bitter hop taste that lingers on the palate. The hops are definitely present, but it seems to be missing some malt presence. Some slight chocolate malt flavors make themselves felt, but the hoppiness dominates.

Mouthfeel: Lighter than expected. The hop oils linger on the palate long after the beer is gone.

Overall: This is a solid brew, but I have had other amber ales that I find better, most notably Terrapin’s Big Hoppy Monster and Lagunitas’ Lucky 13.

Has a great aroma of chewy malts- mild roast, some nutty character, sweet resiny notes, sweet dark bread/dough suggestions (almost rye like). Has a great creamy texture, silky palate. The flavor, as usual with Bear Republic, has a great malt depth- chewy dark bread (sweet rye), nutty, licorice/anise spiciness, cocoa, raisin?, sweet tobacco, and a semi-sweet resiny character which precedes the long, piny, dry finsh. Extremely rich, yet very balanced and highly drinkable. Awesome!","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

The smell was citric hoppy, with undertones of red apples.  The taste was tart, bitter, slightly peaty, and very hearty.  The flavors were strong, but beautifully complimentary, and it was hard to put it down for typing this review.

Medium bodied with a dry rye, hoppy finish.  Big malt character.  Solid body with a nice bitter flavor.  Mild fruity undertones with a hint of grapes.  Subtle vanilla flavor with toast and toffee flavors.  Mellows as it warms with the malts really smoothing out and losing some of the acidic bite.

Remarkable clarity is achieved in the way of grapefruit and pine, though plenty of sweeter, bready scents such as biscuits and toffee are also present. The hops in the flavor are again delightful, but are equally balanced with hearty biscuits, caramel, maybe pumpernickel. Very nice!","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Appearance - Clear, deep ruby under a billowing light brown head that settles slowly, leaving bands of thick reticulated lace

Palate - Mediu to full body, medium carbonation, palate coating richness combines with a light astringency that results in a very satisfying mouthfeel.

The aroma has a great combination of caramel malty goodness and citrus and floral hops.  The flavor exhibits many of the same qualities as the nose.  Up front there is a heavy dose of caramel malt and light hoppiness.  The hops become more noticable mid palate to the finish.  Citrus, herbal, and some pine make an appearance at some point.

A fair amount of sweet caramelly malt and fragrant, piney hops are present in the aroma, along with a little chocolate. Big bodied, but nicely balanced at the end. The flavor is more malt-centric at first, showcasing the caramelly malts, but is quickly followed by piney and earthy hops that bring a nice amount of bitterness. The finish is lingering bitterness.

Smell is a nice balance of sweet caramel malts and subtle floral and citrus hop aroma with oranges, grapefruit and a touch of grass.  Also a bit of dark fruit in the background, maybe raisins.  Taste starts with a big bready malt flavor, smooth and sweet and thick with caramel malts.  The hops are right behind the malt though with more pine present than I get on the smell along with the grapefruit of the citrus hops leaving a crisp and slightly bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied with strong carbonation.  Crisp but smooth.

2358,"2008-05-07",4.5,"Aroma: Malts smell like candied nuts (namely, almonds and cashews) with a tart, fruity overtone... orange marmalade comes to mind. Theres also the faintest hint of brown sugar. Hops impart a crisp, leafy, piney, slightly grassy aroma. I think I also detect a slight vegetable odor, similar to celery. Overall, this reminds me very much of autumn.

Appearance: Deep, dark ruby-brown, kind of similar to oolong tea. Head is tall and resilient, and similar in color to apple butter.

Flavor: Delicious. So well-balanced. Big hop flavor, but the toasty malt makes a strong statement as well. Theres also a subtle, fruity vinous current running through this beer, and the alcohol is also quite pronounced, but not overwhelmingly so. Extremely dry, lingering finish with a bite of alcohol.

Palate: So creamy! I think the mouthfeel is the best thing about this beer. Its hard to describe, but its wonderful... big, thick, and chewy, but still airy and refreshing.

2358,"2008-04-27",3.7,"Bomber via dkachur (thanks!), served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass.
App.:  Deep chestnut/mahogany, clear?, with a moderate tan head.
  
Aroma:  Spicy dried fruits, some pine and grapefruit from the hops, dark bread crust, a bit of sweet caramel and toffee malt that becomes much darker  like a med. roasted coffee, some faint notes of warm spices  ginger and allspice mainly.
  
Palate:  Medium+ body and very soft, silky carbonation give a velvety, pillowy impression.  Yes, I referred to a beer as pillowy.
  
Flav.:  The malts come through as much darker with burnt sugar and some hints of black coffee and dark chocolate, a bit of fruitiness, the hops is more on the piney end of the spectrum; on swallowing, a bit fat shot of bitterness that stays with you, dry and leaves a touch of earth and some burnt sugars.

2358,"2008-02-28",3.3,"Pours with a frothy, three finger thick, lightly browned, tan colored head.  The beer is a dark, concentrated plum, amber hued color that shows a brilliantly clear, cranberry hued color when held up to the light.  This beer is quite hop focused, I dont get any malt at all upon first inspection of the aroma.  Aromas of grapefruit, freshly zested lemon peel, bergamot, tangelo, orange zest and some light pine / herbal notes.  The malt is here, it does in fact play an integral role here with aromas of richly caramelized malt and toasty browned biscuit notes.

This beer has a chewy body, that has a medium heft to it, yet it is not very sweet.  The ample hop character and darker malt notes seem to inhibit the malt sweetness.  Bracingly bitter from the get go, the biting hop character lingers on through to a long finish.  The hop flavors here are influenced heavily by the lack of sweetness; the vibrant fruit notes of the aroma are fairly subtle here, instead flavors of pine, menthol, and a deep herbal note are what is most noticeable.  There is some light notes of grapefruit, and perhaps a touch of orange towards the end where a touch of malt sweetness is able to come through.  The finish has the hop bitterness as well as a sharp, herbal hop astringency and even a touch of toasted, darker grain note.  The malt character, while clearly a supporting role, adds a nice dimension to this brew; toasty malt and bread-like flavors as well as a richly caramelized, yet not sweet malt character.

A pretty tasty brew, I wish that there was a bit more residual malt sweetness to this brew; a solid citrus hop character would have been really nice.  This is actually slightly tart as a result of the lack of sweetness; this is not bone dry though, there is just not enough malt sweetness to stand up to the hops.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2358,"2008-02-08",4.6,"Red Rocket is a deep rusty red ale thats a bit hazy.  The head is gracious-- the color of coffee ice cream.  It leaves sheets of foam on the glass.  The aroma is loud and proud: Cascade hops, in all their grapefruitnpine glory.  There is a light roastiness and something like fresh baked bread.  Nuts and sour candy are in the nose.  The hops pretty much dominate the aroma.  It smells fresh.  It is soft and foamy in the mouth.  It starts with a billowy medium-full body and then turns the mouth dry and crispy at the end.  It makes me take another swig.  Man.  This is loud and proud; bright and bitter.  The hops are solid and juicy.  Its really a lot like grapefruit juice.  The malt lays low and emerges with an alcohol rumble at the end.  It the thunder to the lightning hops in this beer.  The bitterness is incredibly smooth.  Damn fine.  Its been so long since Ive tasted this (constant pitchers at Zeitgeist in SF back in the day) and its been too long.  It seems like a Double IPA to me, but I think that term is newer than the beer.  Great example of the West Coast IPA-ish pale ale.  This is heavy session ale.  It will wreck your taste buds and your liver, but it will coddle you while it does so.","Fairport, New York, USA","yesyouam"

It amazes me that places like Bear Republic, Lagunitas and Stone can charge so little for their beers despite having to ship them halfway across the country.  If all craft beers were this cheap and excellent I think Miller and AB would be in serious trouble.
Aroma / Appearance - The half finger cream head decorates the stained oak body underneath.  It poured a very dark red which let through only about 10% of all the light.  Spruce, caramel and lemons present an interesting contrast for a flavor I have yet to find in any other beer - candied beets.
Flavor / Palate - Hops play against the butterscotch and honey to form a sweet opening impression.  Caramel, malts and peat follow through a few sips later.  The final sips remind me of wet earth, magnolia blossoms and tea leaves.  It is simultaneously sippable and sessionable depending which way you like to drink your scotch ales.  This is a great value and if you want something inexpensive for an evening give this a try.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Finishes with even more hop flavor thats toasty and buttery, and the bitterness is pretty mellow.  Cloys a little bit after the finish, despite the beer not being syrupy at all.

A big malt odor lurks behind the floral hoppiness with a slight metallic tinge the only negative.  Oily hoppiness rolls onto the tongue with an orange peel flavor and medium bitterness.  The thin malt flavor is overwhelmed by the hops but still detectable during the middle of a mouthful.  But when the brew heads for the back of the mouth, a moderate astringency and stronger hop bitterness quickly drown out the malt.

A super nice blend of soft citrus notes like tangerine combine with sugary malt and piney hops.  Unfortunately the flavor didnt find the balance that the aroma did.

Difficult taste to evaluate; Ive no experience with Scottish red ales and in any event this is one is not supposed to be typical of the style. I want to say its well balanced, in that I taste both the hop and the malt--but the tastes on both sides are strong. How can you have a bitter hoppy kick AND strong sweet maltiness at the same time? This beer shows you can. Not sure I like it completely but I love the fact that this brewery goes all out in its brews.

Pours a rich, sherried honey color with a pleasent, tight head. Nice, pungent aroma of toasted hazelnut and spicy rye. Hits the mouth with an initial dry bitterness that quickly steps aside to make room for a smooth, nutty, caramel-tinted body and a come-hither finish. I must drink deeply again and again. Tasty.

The initial aroma, for me, was very hoppy with underlying tones of caramel and malt. Complex is a fantastic adjective for this beer as there seems to be so much in it, that many specific flavors and scents are not discernable.  The overall mouthfeel is almost silky and the taste of malt comes to the forefront.  An aftertaste of mild hops and some earthy spice follow.  Although I dont care for hoppy beers, this is balanced very nicely and is very drinkable for people with a variety of preferences as the experience is and extraordinarily in-tune and complimentary package (aroma, taste, body, aftertaste) to experience.","Utah, USA","blindeyedbetty"

Mild malty sweetness with dry powdery bitterness. Finish is medium bitter with dry chalkiness. Bitter end with floral notes but not over the top.

2358,"2007-03-03",4.3,"22oz. Bomber

Opened with a hefty pop. Havent opened a bottle, that didnt have a cork on it, that sounded like that in a long while. Huge carbonation on the pour. Half my glass was head. 

Red rocket has an unbelievably big rocky head. The head looked like a mountain with all kinds of peaks. Hazy dark red with tiny particles floating in it. The head reminds me of a root beer float. The lace sticks like huge chunks on the glass. I dont think I have ever seen a head this chunky on a beer before. Looks delicious. After finishing this beer theres still a quarter inch head on the bottom of the glass. Impressive!

This beer really smells interesting. Ripe melons come to mind and some kiwi. I dont know why but this beer smells really fruity and fresh. Theres a caramel smell poking through the fruit. Very inviting. I cant wait to drink just to see what tastes will come through.

MMM....A solid caramel maltiness comes through at first and is quickly followed by a nice assertive hop bite with a mild lingering bitterness. Theres the smallest amount of alcohol present. Theres some other flavors I cant put my finger on.

The mouthfeel is excellent. Its smooth and very creamy. Its like velvet in my mouth.

Drinkability is good. I could very easily drink a lot of these. The more I drink the more filling it gets though. I would drink these till I filled up.

Overall Red Rocket is one of the best red ales Ive had up to this point. It will be a hard one to beat.

2358,"2007-02-01",4.1,"This bottle of Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale was sent to me by bitbucket from the first part of our multi-part trade.  Thanks Bob!  I have been really looking forward to trying this beer (especially after having a couple of the other Bear Republic brews)...

No matter how I pour this beer, a MASSIVE light brown colored whipped foam head is generated.  However, it is really hypnotic to watch the bubbles stream down like sand in a hour glass as the liquid rises from the bottlom and the head and top shrinks.  In the end, there is still a pretty think foamy head that has excellent retention and collapses unevenly.  This creates interesting craters and ridges on top which look wrinkly as it condenses.  The head never completely collapses, so the residual lacing is quite think and prolific.  The color of the beer is medium to dark brown and somewhat cloudy.  This beer is very aromatic and has lots of orange and citrus hops which rocket from the bottle as soon as the cap is popped off.  There is also some sweet caramel maltiness that blends nicely with the hoppy aromas.  This beer really does taste as good as and exactly like it smells!  At first it has a nice caramel maltiness and mild hoppiness.  Then more of the citrus hops flavor and bitterness comes out as it moves into and though the drier, rye-like finish.  The bitterness is well controlled (moderate) and has a nice sweet, almost spicy, pine/citrus hop flavor.  The body of this beer is medium/full and it is mildly carbonated.  It is extremely smooth on the palate.  This beer is amazingly full flavored and well balanced overall.  I would love to drink this beer one right after the other.  I dont think its possible to grow tired of it.  Plus, its only 6.8% ABV which makes this a great beer to drink in quantity.  Too bad I cant buy it here in Ohio (but that might be a good thing since I could almost take this stuff intravenously!).  Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale is just as good, if not better than Stone Arrogant Bastard and Stone Double Bastard!  Thanks again Bob!  This one was really a treat!","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

2358,"2006-04-26",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2009 Pours a mostly clear, deep garnet/brown color; head is light tan, mostly full, and pillowy leaving a small froth after some time and a bit of lace.  Nose is fairly simple but nice with citrus hops (grapefruit), light grassy notes, faint resinous notes, sweet caramel, and hints at raisin.  Flavor is far less hoppy than expected; a toasty, biscuity, caramel sweetness is prominent with some brown sugar and just hints of scotch smoke; the lightly resinous and citrusy hops taking over into the finish with a more than moderate bitterness.  Palate is lively with a medium-full body and an interesting crisp and creamy texture (if that is possible!).  The beer finishes mostly bitter with light underlying notes of sweet caramel and the scotch smoke just hanging around until the end.  This really reminded me of a strong, hefty American pale ale with a slight scottish character.  It is a beer caught between being a drinkable beer and a complex Imperial strength beer.  Something interesting for sure and not something you find in your everyday beers, but something I would buy again whenever I wanted something different from the norm.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Pours an attractive caramel red with a good head and sick lacing. I just love the aroma of this beer: fruity centennial hops, baked apples with raisins and cinnamon, warm toffee.

Unfortunately, the aroma is the highpoint. The flavor is a rather ill-suited blend of strong burnt-caramel malts with hints of peat, and the big can-kicking C-hop extravaganza of a good PacNW IPA. After starting off with that marvellous aroma, Im left with a slightly sticky, somewhat syrupy, significantly sweet American Strong Ale. This is the sort of yet-another-sweet-ASA Id drink for #3 of the night at the Big Time Brewery and then forget about by morning. Theres nothing unpleasant about this beer, and I can even safely say that the parts are pretty darn nice -- but the whole falls well short of their sum.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Theyre all the same to me! Give me a Belgian or an English Strong Ale any day. These ""Double"" Red/Amber/Brown/Scottish/whatever with punishing levels of similiar hop profiles just dont light my fire. Yeah, theyre tasty and theyre good carriers of west coast hops, but I really dont feel like the malt character is that much better or more interesting than an IIPA. Anyway, enough ranting, time to get rating. Heres what I though. Pours a hazed light brawny fire, with a finger of clean creamy tan head. Rich, but typical, Cascade orange and pine aroma. Flavor is a punishing orange resin, with fresh squeeze grapefruit and floral with a hint of Jack Pine. Very light gentle toffee in the sweet background malt character. Head is ridiculously lacy. Light nuttiness and a hint of lemon. Palate leaves a grassy fresh bite on the tounge. Good body and thickness. Maybe I need to have a bad example of these attempts before I can appreciate them more.

Strong heavy sweet malt with molasses and pine hops (some spice and sour notes as it warms, perhaps some tobacco).  The flavor, however, is more of a quick hit between many flavors (sadly not as deep as I expected).  Syrupy molasses hits you first and moves into stand alone pine hops.  Very in your face for a moment in the middle, but mellows into a conglomeration (well blended) of malt and hop mix (again, mostly pine and molasses).  As it warms the flavors mellow into a more agreeable combination.  Similar flavors, just better blended.  Some smokiness in there also as it warms.  There is also some chalkish/charcoal mouth feel at the end (this moves to more creamy as we warm up here).  Overall the aroma is the champ in this one.  The flavor is good and the body really starts to open up and hold up as it warms.  While not my fav. Still very enjoyable.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"
2358,"2005-08-02",4.0,"Draft at the brew pub.  Same pine sap hop bouquet as Racer 5 and Hot Rod, a bit sweeter and maltier, gorgeous lacing, great session ale.","Northern Liberties, Pennsylvania, USA","pobenohne"
2358,"2005-07-23",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2006 Bottled.  Rich and better balanced than before.  Pine is more of a back-seat flavor, with g-fruit in the fore.  Warmth didnt make the beer as harsh as before.  Overall, more pleasant, better lacing...kind of simple, but good: enjoyed to the last.  Also, second glass laced fine this time.

Bottled.  Mostly opaque, dark reddish brown liquid topped by a small, sand colored head that laces in wonderful sheets and rings (on the first glass).  Body is medium-light(light for the beer).  Carbonation is soft and foamy, filling the mouth--very well done.  Finish is lightly wet, then dry and mouthwatering.  Aroma is malt laden and honeyed with caramel, but with a strong hop presence as well.  Strikingly floral, noticably citrus and grapefruit rind at that; however, the citrus smells incredibly sweet, like sweet orange meat...yet its grapefruit.  Sugared grapefruit it is.  Flavor is lightly malty and dominated by hops.  Hone, sugar, grapefruit, orange, pine(dominant hop flavor, but pleasantly so), wet grains and yeast that hasnt been spent in something that I bet would ""bottle condition"" into something...quite balanced and malty.  Could use a few months in the cellar--pine becomes a bit ""over the top"" after a while; but really not a big deal...it would simply be more user friendly after 3-6mos.  Some toasty flavor in the finish: I wasnt sure at first, but its fairly pronounced by the second glass.  Tasty, relaxing and even a bit refreshing.  Bodys a bit light, but carb is well done.  Surely enjoyed.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"
2358,"2005-07-22",3.7,"22 oz. bottle.  Hmmmm.  Interesting concept here, but it didnt quite pay off for me.  Hopping everything to hell pays off well in general and Bear Republic goes that route here.  Poured a very interesting tan-brown-some-red color with a white head.  Taste has a smooth start and ends with very hoppy twist.  Tastes like a strong, highly-hopped bitter.  This was my first Bear Republic and Ive had more styles and they were much better.  Good, but I certainly prefer their other stuff.","Florida, USA","JMFG"

The beer is actually pretty tricky to pour due to the amount and retention of the firm suds. Aroma is stong of citrus/grassy hop and equalled with sweet toffee like malts.

This brew pours a gorgeous hazy brown, with a very stellar beige/white head. It smells of caramel malt with slight cocoa notes meshed with wood and earth.

Finishes very spicy, with a sucker-punch of an alcohol singe...Very complex, as many Scottish heavies I have tried...a bit unfriendly and confused, which knocks the drinkability a bit.

Aroma has lots of citrus and pine hops, and also caramel.  Hops definitely dominate the flavor profile with a piney, spicy, citric character.  Hops flavor is built on a malt foundation of caramel, brown sugar, and dark fruit.  These elements blend well together and this beer is smooth around the edges.

Pours a dark redish-brown with a large chunky head that never goes away but to leave a thick lace down the sides of the glass.

Scent is, well, floral hops.

Taste is definately floral hops as well; the dry-hopping is quite apparent. This gets better as it warms and becomes more complex. Caramel malt and some darker fruits and citrus are present as well.

Malts are sweet and carmel tasting, but subdued as the hops begin to dominate soon into the taste.

Figgy, mushy malts struggle to the top along with barky malts, cocoa, lemon oil, and honeysuckle. Thick, sappy texture. Feathery carbonation. Thick malt flavors are immediately countered by a rubbery astringency. Bushy hops and lemon oils pucker the cheeks while the hop bitterness squashes the subtle caramel flavors. Brief earthy flashes of moss and peat, yet again, succumb to the sappy hops. Astringently waxy, rindy finish with just enough delicate flower notes and powdery malts to soften it up. Remnants of oxidation, toasted malt, hop leaf, and fig flavors.

Deep, dark red-brown color, unfiltered but lacking much sedimentation, with a good-sized creamy, uneven, off-white head and spectacularly thick lacing.  Malty, toasty and sweet to start, becoming tart and fruity with suggestions of orange, apricot and white raisin, and turning substantially earthy, hoppy, spicy and moderately bitter.  Aftertaste is balanced and rather complex, all of the above ingredients just kind of hanging around for various intervals of time, showing a bit of aggressive hop here, some reddish malt there.  Interesting mouthfeel, smooth and creamy but effervescent with the tiny bubbles creating an intriguing backdrop for the multitude of flavor attributes.

Aroma is pleasant of a nice leafy hop bringing a smooth woody earthy dryness over the top of some dulled fruityness and toasted, nearly burnt malts. Taste has a very nice balance of toasted malts and grassy/woody dry hops, starts smooth and lightly sweet of malts as it turns toasted with a substantial building over the palate of the toastyness with the wood dryness sneaking in just past midway and making a home through to the finish where it mixes nicely with notes of dulled dried fruit of apricot, peach, and raisin, and finishes with an overall super nice earthy dryness and texture. Feel is close to full, detains a smoother start then raises from there into the drying finish, slim toastyness lingers. This is a very good amber, one of the better ones I've had with a nice dry hop profile that was hardly bitter in any form, just some tiny glimmers of bite that made this a very nice drinker with a certain complexity that was favorable to my palate.

2358,"2003-03-09",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2004 -Bear Republic comes in with another heavyweight.  This time they've taken a rightfully obscure style, Scottish Ale, and turned it into a mandatory periodic purchase.  The hops blast is a fantastic counterpunch to the rich malt profile.  It's a malt profile that stands by itself... which is so unlike the malt profiles of other Scottish Ales that tend to get lost in the ""smokiness"" of the style and ultimately come across as thin.  Not the Red Rocket, there is a concerted effort by the hops, malt, and alcohol in attacking the smokiness.  Ultimately, the forces of good (hops, malt, and alcohol) win out over the forces of evil (uninspired thinness of character typical of the style).  The result is a full-spectrum completeness that has been begging for years from this style.                                                 ........................  Mixing notes:  With Red Rocket the hops do a fine job of wiping the smoke off the palate, like ginger at a sushi bar.  If you're looking to linger over the smoke as it usually carries over between sips of Scottish Ale then forget about it.  However, since the beer has a very resinous (but not oily or slick) character it can be used to some advantage when exploring the malt profiles of other beers... maibocks, in particular.  My favorite combo is a 22oz Rocket followed by a bottle of Ayinger Maibock.  I'm not sure what it is but the malt flavor that comes out of the Ayinger after drinking a Rocket is nothing short of fantastic.  And the effect lasts throughout the whole bottle of maibock... such is the ""lingering"" nature of the Rocket (what do you know, it's a Scottish Ale after all).  Finally, both of these dogs clock in at 6.8% ABV and after the first round your mental acuity becomes inversely related to the volume of your voice.","Alabama, USA","roacheater"

2358,"2003-01-30",4.0,"Red-amber color with a medium head.  Earthy hop nose with doughy malt to balance.  Thick mouthfeel with a nice hopd profile throughout.  Meaty malts with bread dough and toffee showing nicely.  Bitter, clean finish.  Very nice.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"
2358,"2003-01-23",4.2,"Ruby/amber color with a bubbly light tan head.  Fresh hops and mild peat aroma.  Deep malt flavors greet your palate.  Flavors of peat and dark toffee, along with a slight juniper/medicinal tint.  A scottish ale with a kick- no doubt. Outstanding lingering malt and peat flavors, that remind me of chewing specialty malts. A heavy wee heavy.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
2358,"2003-01-22",3.6,"Bright ruby color with thin head and nose of sweet roast grain.  Subtle smokey flavors with a huge hop finish.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
2358,"2003-01-18",3.9,"Brown-red color with a nice white head. Huge hops aroma...pine, citrus, and some sweet maltiness. The flavor was big...malty, hoppy, and everything else in between. This beer packs an alcohol kick...it got me more buzzed than a 6.8% abv should.","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"
2358,"2003-01-07",3.9,"Pours a dark clear amber color with a big, off-white rocky head that lingers for a while. Strong hoppy and malty aroma. Medium bodied and strong, quite a robust scottish red ale (bastardized according to the brewers...What the hell is a Scottish red ale?). Flavor is quite malty at first, but the hops kick in towards the end and in the finish. Very good, me likes, me drink again..","Greenville, South Carolina, USA","Uglyradio"
2358,"2002-11-15",3.8,"Nice dark amber color.  Malty aroma with a hint of roastiness.  Nice roasted flavor that ends slightly sweet.  Quite an enjoyable brew.","Acworth, Georgia, USA","belgianhomebrew"
2358,"2002-10-31",3.6,"Bottle.  Deep red with a laced beige head.  Slight fruit aroma with flavors of berries and a dry finish.  Tap in mid-October: Reddish brown with a strong hop bitterness.  Malty aroma and a little sweet.  Interesting graininess with some smoke burnt flavors.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"
2358,"2002-10-30",3.3,"sausagy, definetly red, monster head, good hops.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","P-tor44"
2358,"2002-10-23",3.7,"Pudding brown with less head then a debutante.  Malt for days, fresh cookie and chocolate with some resinous hops with little bits of brewers yeast laguidly floating around the body.  Malt covered hop cones, campfire smokieness, huge in the mouth, Long vinous finish that tapers into an acorn aftertaste.","Yokosuka, JAPAN","Marc"
2358,"2002-10-22",3.9,"looks like more of a brown rocket ale, surprising smokiness and nicely hopped","Sisters, Oregon, USA","Zach Diesel"
2358,"2002-10-14",4.0,"This brewery consistently surprises me. It begins with an intriguing malty smell that is reminiscent of sniffing a handful of crushed barley. The head is big, solid white, and wanders around the sides of the glass like icy stalagmites. This is really red, no lie, a very copperish red, but still red and crystal clear. The malt in this is very pronounced and hits you with a nice butterscotch sweetness. It goes a long way in capturing the raw essence of malted barley without too much overkill. The elegant hop finish is a wonderful counterpoint to the big malt taste and balances out just right. Wonderful beer.","San Diego, California, USA","SpaceMonkey"
2358,"2002-10-12",4.1,"on tap GABF 02:  Hoppy aroma with enough malt nose to let you know it has some.  Red color with nice head, full robust body, ends fairly bitter for a while.  Flavor is deep and wonderful.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
2358,"2002-09-22",3.8,"Every single beer Ive had from this brewery has been great. This was no exception. Great balance of hops/malt. Beautiful dark red color. This is what I like in a Scottish ale. Bear Republic cant go wrong.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
2358,"2002-09-18",3.9,"beautiful deep amber/mahogony. Decent head and lace. Nose of carmel, peaty smokiness, sprucy hops are there but not in the forefront. Thick body, sweet caramelly like malts, peaty twangs, maybe subtle spices lurking about, sappy hops in abundance but kept at bay nicely by the sweetness of the malt. I thought it was gonna be hoppier to be honest. This is good but missing a bright spot, flavors seemed a bit dull/muddled. Maybe its a little to thick? But anyways, its good, hearty, smooth and has a nice kick. Thank you herbjones.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
2358,"2002-09-18",4.4,"Deep opaque red.  Nice little off-white head that stuck around.  An excellent ale, very hoppy and dry.  Quite woody.  As it warms, the malts become a bit more prevalent, with an increasing sweetness and a nice, toasty finish.  Get woodiness and a hint of brandy.  Palate is glorious, full and soft, just felt wonderful in the mouth.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
2358,"2002-09-16",3.9,"Deep red color, medium head. Roasted malts, nice mellow hop signature. Some sweetness. Finish is clean and soft. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, some sweetness.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
2358,"2002-09-06",3.8,"Like a cross betweeen an IPA and a Scotch Ale.  The aroma is pure NW citrus hops, while the flavour is more chocolatey, but still has a nice hop bite.  I like!!","San Diego, California, USA","Kaya161"
2358,"2002-08-31",3.8,"Deep copper/ruby color. Sticky, creamy light tan head.  Burnt caramel and light cocoa flavor.  Nice hoppy bitter finish.","San Diego (Mira Mesa), California, USA","papajohn"
2358,"2002-08-27",4.1,"Big beautiful off-white head atop deep, reddish-brown brew. Lots of maltyness in the nose. Smells of cinnamon and a bit of brownsugar as well. Take a drink. Sugary sweetness that fades to a slight coffee-like bitterness. Has a bit of spicyness upfront as well. Really great beer.

does not taste like drinking wood.","Riverside, California, USA","uglybastard"
2358,"2002-08-24",3.0,"Very hoppy, dark ale. Taste like drinking wood.","The Big Apple, USA","carlitos99"
2358,"2002-07-19",4.4,"This is one damned tasty brew. Copper hued with a wood fruit nose. Complex flavors that take center stage as the glass warms. Yes, similar to Stones AB but a bit mellower. I do love them both!","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
2358,"2002-07-15",4.6,"When I placed the order for this through Liquid Solutions my intention was to order the Hop Rod Rye Ale. I guess I got my wires crossed, but, on the other hand, I wish all of my mistakes would turn out this great! Claret in color with a rich and creamy head that reduces itself to a thin ring around the glass. Immense toasted malt aroma with traces of fresh baked bread and caramel. Intense roasted coffee flavor (akin to biting into a freshly roasted coffee bean) with hins of bitter chocolate. A long, hoppy and malty finish. Great way to wind out the weekend!","Medford, New Jersey, USA","jcalbi"
2358,"2002-06-19",4.1,"Well what do you know.  A happenstance gift from PsychProf fulfills two recent ambitions of mine.  So much buzz about Bear Republic recently and this becomes my first shot at them.  And then yesterday Oakes initiates the American Strong style onsite and lo, turns out Red Rocket fits the bill, giving me a chance to explore the style.  The beer?  Oh yeah.  Well, it comes surging forth with a huge head roaring over a deep garnet body and an effervescent effect much quicker than, but similar to, a Guinness cascade.  The aroma is honeymalty, strong with hops and you get a charge of those hops in the taste, too, but theyre largely blasted away by the sweet gunpowder smoke of the exceptional malt.  I dont know if its easier to handle than the Bastard or if my palate has just grown up considerably from by first sip of the ol AB.  Anyway, I enjoyed the beer.  Chalk up two American Strongs for hennes!","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
2358,"2002-06-16",3.6,"Deep garnet in color, the head is large and beige, the lace in sheets to coat the glass. Nose is malt, floral and hints of caramel. Front is sweet, the top is medium, the finish is highly hopped, acidic, dry, and quite a Hoot.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
2358,"2002-06-07",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2004 You have to admire this brewery. I have never had a scottish ale packed this heavily with precisely the malt required, and a heavy dose of hops to boot! Not true to style, yes. The bastard brother to a more refined version like Alesmith's, but hey, who needs refinement. This brewery rocks my world. Thanks to crate and barrel stoppers, I can sample away without drunkeness, or maybe not...Sweet, peat, and heat.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
2358,"2002-05-24",2.8,"I tried it this evening.  I tell ya...It sounded good and the reviews all read well so, Im sure its me but, I didnt like it.  It was too sweet and too rich (if thats possible).  Maybe I was looking forward to it too much.  It smelled great and had a rich full head that stuck around but I just couldnt tolerate the taste and didnt finsih it.","San Diego, California, USA","Diego"
2358,"2002-02-20",4.3,"Deep dark amber. Nice creamy foam with generous lacing and a resinous surface. Huge hoppy green, bushy, piney aroma with wisps of peat over a resinous surface. After the big flavor smack in the face, it feels a bit drying, slightly finely particulate. More big malt, big hops with some alcohol in the finish. The 6.8% is definitely appreciable.  Comparison to Arrogant Bastard is unavoidable.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
2358,"2002-02-07",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2003 Garnet body topped by healthy beige head.  Aroma is sweet, grapefruit, caramel, floral.  Taste is malty, earthy, mildly sweet, light peat, alcohol, finishing earthy/grapefruit bitter.  Medium full body, slightly chewy.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2358,"2002-01-14",4.6,"A real kick in the butt!  Hoppy, aggressive, a nice wake up call on a hot Saturday.  Solid brewery across the board.","Sacramento, California, USA","geofflilley99"
2358,"2002-01-08",4.0,"This is a really good beer, missed the brewery in Healdsburg, but caught the brew in Eureka.  Wonderful hoppy, flavorful beer that was just right.

2358,"2001-05-22",3.9,"Basterdized may be a little harsh, but not very close to a McEwans Scotch Ale. Caramel/Chocolate malt, smooth creamy mouthfeel. Nice hoppy bitter finish.","California, USA","BeerLimey"
2358,"2001-05-16",4.0,"Mahogany colour, rocky head, and a rich, earthy aroma and palate showing lots of caramelly malts and foresty hops. The brewery considers this a bastardized Scottish ale, and they might not be far off - maybe a strong, robustly hopped Irish Ale is more accurate.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
2358,"2001-05-01",3.8,"Big, creamy, lots of flavor. I dont know that I agree it is a Scottish ale. Too hoppy for that. But I like hops and I like this beer. The fermentation has produced some great flavors. I think Ill have to pick some up next time I go to BevMo. 

(PS, the brewery is a fun place, too. Good pub grub. Last time I was ther in 1998, they had regular live music.)","Livermore, California, USA","Davidw987"
