1440,"2016-02-03",3.8,"Tasted on tap at 2016 Wolpertinger Fest in glass German beer mug. It poured a clear reddish amber colour with nice beige foam, mousse-like, long-lasting with lace. Low but pleasant aroma. Flavour was grassy, grainy, malty with a delicious caramel residual sweetness, toasty, nutty, biscuity, some grit and delicate spice. Firm bitter balance, earthy, resiny. Very tasty and well-crafted. The way Dusseldorf Alt is described, I always think Ill love it but seldom do when presented with knock-offs. This is proof that a good one is as good as they say. I think this is an Urban Chestnut regular, but I hadnt tasted it before, and it was one of my favourites at the fest.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"
1440,"2015-07-15",3.3,"500ml bottle. Beaut of a pour, a mahogany type brown hue, creamy and large off-white head. ARoma is raisins, nuts, cocoa, and herbs. Flavor is well-hopped and dry, but the tanginess of it is a bit disruptive to the hops as is the pervasive malt character which in this style should be scaled down a bit. Certainly is a nice beer, comes off as an ale version of a hoppy dunkel, but not exactly a perfect alt. More brown ale than pale ale.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
1440,"2015-06-17",2.6,"On tap at Grove location. Aroma: Red grape or berries; light caramel tea biscuits. Appearance: Lightly carbonated murky copper with a foamy tan head that fades into a healthy skin. Flavor: Caramel tea biscuits and fruity esters throughout; the finish is fairly dry and has a healthy bitterness. Palate: Light body, sticky texture, soft carbonation, bitter finish. Overall: Didnt do much for me; my least impressive UC beer of the day.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"

1440,"2015-05-30",3.3,"Bottle. Appearance: Deep ruby reddish brown and clear, with a thick, frothy khaki colored head that lingers. 
Aroma: Bready, toasted, and roasty malt aromas. 
Taste: Malt is very toasted bread crust-like, hint of nuts, turning to a strong roast. Bitterness kicks in sharply on the backside, and when combined with the roasty malt there is some astringency. 
Mouthfeel: Body is a little light and thin, with a moderate carbonation. 
Finish: Sharp kick of bitterness and roast on the finish, with slight astringency. 
Overall: A good, light, easy drinking rendition of an alt, with a bit too much roasty character for the style. Drinks really closely to an American Brown Ale","","TH28"
1440,"2015-05-26",4.0,"Pours a clean, amber/brown color with a fantastic creamy, off-white head that hangs around for a long time. Aroma is very malt centered with a smooth toasted malt, light mix of hay and bread with a very pronounced grassy and light earthy hops finish. Flavor has an awesome toasted grainy Munich malt early in the tasting with a light touch of chocolate malt/light roasted malt and finishes with a smooth noble hop grassy spalt hop flavor. Body is perfect with it feeling crisp but has a hefty feeling to it and a great carbonation rate. Overall a fantastic example of the Alt style. So far, I have been extremely impressed with everything I have had the chance to sample from Urban Chestnut.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"
1440,"2015-05-21",3.5,"The beer pours a slightly hazy, dark copper color with a medium-sized khaki-colored head. The aroma blends nutty and toasted malts with dough yeast, and the taste is mildly umami, slightly sour, and a touch sweet with an aftertaste that is dry and reminiscent of nuts and toast. The palate has a sift carbonation, thin and slick texture, and a medium-light body.","Columbia, Missouri, USA","EtTuCthulhu"
