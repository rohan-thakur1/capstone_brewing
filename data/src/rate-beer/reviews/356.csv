356,"2017-04-29",4.0,"Bottle at the radikal whale slaying. Thnx to Eric. Pours unclear darker blonde. Small white head. Smell is funky, sour, some oak. rich wood. Fairly complex. taste is sour, fairly dry. Pretty wood forward. Nice. Berhaps a bit too young sours were used in the blend, as it has some residential sweetness left. OK complexity. Nice beer.","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"
356,"2017-04-29",4.3,"From notes. Enjoyed at Dougs house for the Whale Tasting and Poker Night, almost 18 months in planning. 500 mL bottle. The pour is a bright, clean golden yellow with a thick ring of white head and no lace as it vanishes. This looks great. The aroma is a little funky. There is a strong citrus zest and a hint of some stone fruit that starts to peek through. The barnyard quality on this is surprisingly more than the 2014. Its dusty, fruity, funky, and lovely. The flavor is pretty good as well. I like the crispness and the cleanliness to go with the heavy citrus, light stone fruit, and the quality balance of fink and barnyard. I like this. The mouth feel is a little syrupy with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly fruity and funky finish. This one is pretty balanced and lovely.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

356,"2016-10-13",4.0,"500ml. Had this release weekend and didnt realize it was a new entry. So giving another try. Color is opaque pale yellow. Slight white head. Aroma is an oaky lemon with a little candy sweetness. Taste is a nice blend of sour, sweetness and oak. Grapefruit citrius, lemon. Good amount of funk under the sour. Some dry brett on the finish. I remember this one having more of a yeast and funk forward taste initially, really soured up nicely.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"

356,"2016-09-14",4.1,"Sampled via 500ml bottle during Great Taste of the Midwest 2016 in Madison. Wisconsin. Pours a hazy golden pale colored brew with a thin white head that quickly dissipates and leaves behind some thin lacing and film top. Aroma of lemon funk, a touch of vanilla/oak, some citrus zest and a touch of white grapes. Taste is medium bodied, mild tartness with citrus, vanilla and a hint of lemon. Finish continues the mild tartness with some earthy notes in the aftertaste.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
356,"2016-08-30",3.9,"500 ml bottle via trade. Pours a cloudy gold with a small white head that settles into a ring and film. Awesome sawdusty, lemony aroma, with dusty wheat, lactic and citric acidity, pineapple, oak, and vanilla. The flavor doesnt quite stand up to the nose, bringing a dampness that isnt there, and relying more on the malt and sweetness. Light-medium bodied, with a tart, funky mouthfeel and moderate to medium carbonation. Doesnt live up to the promise of the aroma, but very good nonetheless.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
356,"2016-08-26",4.4,"500 ml bottle shared by phaleslu. Thanks! Moderately hasy gold with a white head of foam. Aroma has intense layers of lemon, wood, vinegar, unripe berries, musty grapes.

356,"2016-07-17",4.1,"500ml bottle acquired from the Hilltop Brewery Release (New Glarus, WI). Pours a lively golden glowing hue, just a touch of haze, sunny glow and cascading bubbles through the body meet a sizable bright white head atop. Firm crown sticks well, a nice layer with good lacing overall. Aromas show rustic grain, jabs of lactic and citric acidity. Stone fruit, pineapple, crab apple meet a house middling dusty and rustic bretty appeal. Tart fruit, a subtle cheesiness and sweaty brow. Decent tannic oak is softer, inviting with yogurt, cereal grains, and straw. Melon, apple, and a bit of subtle tropical appeal. Definitely some alluring stuff but more fruity, a touch younger overall. Initial is tart and sour, a firmer lactic and citric acidic punch up front shows grapefruit, lemon, pithy bitter fruit and some spritzy bite. Brett comes on, a bit bitter, dry, and certainly second fiddle. Middle settles down a bit, fruity and grainy with some growing yet mellow bretty appeal. Lighter bodied, a bit fuzzy overall with some yogurt, dust and oaky appeal as we round the corner. Apricot, pineapple, bready malts, a bit of mineral like aspirin and still a firmer lactic twang into the backend and finish. A pretty pour and bright nose lead into a melange of fruity expression and firmer sour appeal overall. A younger brett expression that may develop with more time, this drinks really well with brighter fruit elements, some nice supporting oak, a brett funk that isnt complex or overdone but seems on its way. Tasty stiff really that I think is ready right now but some brett heads may want to ride out a bit. I find this much better out the gate than last years Vintage release though.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
356,"2016-06-28",3.7,"Shared 500 ml. bottle poured to a snifter showing a hazed, orangey gold color, with an expeditiously diminishing layer of white head foam, and ribbons & spots of lacing. The nose was a touch of yeasty/barnyard funk, wheat, mild oakiness, and tartness, with esters as grapefruit, lemon, and a bit of ripe pit fruit. Light to medium bodied, with lively carbonation, the taste was similar notes, tart & tangy, with some tannic astringency, and a dry finish. Well worth the wait in line.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
