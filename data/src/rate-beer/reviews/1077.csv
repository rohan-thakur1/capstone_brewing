1077,"2016-04-22",3.3,"Cask handpump at the Cock Tavern - Hackney. Noted at 5%. Pours hazy yellow with a creamy, white head. Interesting aroma, a little dank, with some rotting pear, herbs, lemon peel. Light to medium sweet flavour with lots of overripe fruit, mellow pear, some green herbs, maybe rosemary, slight citric tang, salty sweat, doughy biscuits. Medium bodied with spritzy carbonation. Finishes with more herbal notes, ripe lemon, dough, impressions of pear, apple skin, pie crust. Quite interesting stuff on the whole, although I wouldnt say the drinkability is very high.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
