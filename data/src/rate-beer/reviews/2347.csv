2347,"2017-04-21",4.3,"Appearance - beautiful mahogany brown color with a creamy foam top.

Aroma - raisins, honey, a hint of toasty maltiness, nice and spicy with clove and anise-seed.

Taste - echoes the aroma. I normally dislike Belgian strong ales due to their banana-y cloyingly sweet esthers, but this was a very welcome exception. The sweetness had more of a honey, even raisin characteristics without being annoyingly sweet, and the star anise notes I got from it were simply gorgeous.

Palate - not watery, not too syrup-y, and not so fizzy it drowns out the flavors. Well done.

Overall - a very, very well-made beer. My favorite holiday beer to date, indeed: my favorite spiced beer in general to date. I really, really enjoyed this and definitely got me in the christmas/wintery mood. Honestly, the only thing this beer needed more was a fireplace to enjoy it by and snow falling in the background. And I say that despite the fact that I normally, full disclosure, absolutely despise Gouden Carolus (I find it too cloyingly sweet for me). In fact, this is the beer that inspired my first homebrew. Id say that speaks for itself.","","teddybearontap"

2347,"2017-01-03",3.2,"75cl bottle at home (26 XII 2016), shared with friends. A yellow-ish, golden white collar tops a black mass with a firm dark brown gloom. This for sure is a good looking Christmas ale. The nose already has heavily sweet, cloying scents with different hints at Liegeois syrup, anise and a firm Iberian red wine, even gluhwein hint. All this is backed with a malt character. The mouthfeel keeps on being sugar-intensive, even - sweetish rather than sweet - artificial in this respect. The taste is full of that typical Belgian dark pear syrup, anise, old-fashioned cough pastilles, liquorice, Ochsenblut (ox blood). On the tongue there is a little roast, with hints of chestnut, even one or two raisins as well. All this is very subtle though. The whole however is not that complex. Thank God, the ending is well balanced: Not that sweet, not that heavily spiritful. This alcohol almost has a genever quality. This nature grants a spicy hops, almost coriander feeling to the Christmas brew. Quite a good - although with one or more artificial dashes - Belgian Christmas ale with strong Ricard anisette backbone.","Waarschoot, BELGIUM","Hamirubi"

Nose is beautifully spicy, red berry leads the characteristic house esters, and theres medium caramel and alcohol. Is that licorice? Or mint? Pour dull chestnut with a little underlying ruby in the glass, sort of reminds me of an Altbier, supports a soapy-rocky beige head. Taste a little plummier, brings out the licorice/anise character much more, but thats only about medium in the big picture, a perfect compliment to the inky plum and caramel. Smooth full body but not fat, edged with some thin and wispy alcohol, subtle clove, throat warming, sticky lips. Faint pepper, faint mint, possibly some faded orange peel but mostly that enjoyable drop/anise, even woodruff - just a lovely bouquet of woodsiness, herbs, and none of it is too bold or overplayed.

Per quanto riguarda il gusto, capisco che possa piacere ma siamo ai margini del suo stile. Aromatica e forte, non passa inosserveta come gusto, anche troppo.
Infatti lesplosione di sapore è caratterizzata soprattutto da una forte componente di liquirizia, per i miei gusti fin troppo invadente.
Carbonatazione, come tutte le strong belghe in bottiglia, elevata, fin troppo.
Il limite di questa birra, secondo me, è quello che, vista la fortissima e sbilanciata personalità, non è abbinabile a praticamente nessun piatto.-------& looks and foam. Respectively load mahogany and fine and perfect.
As for the taste, but I understand that he may please the edge of his style. Aromatic and strong, it does not pass inosserveta as taste, too.
In fact, the explosion of flavor is mainly characterized by a strong component of licorice, for my taste too intrusive.
Carbonation, like all Belgian strong in the bottle, high, too.
The limit of this beer, in my opinion, is that, given the very strong and unbalanced personality, is not matched to virtually any dish.

2347,"2016-12-23",4.4,"La brasserie Het Anker na pas fait de détail pour son opus de Noël : 6 épices (exceptionnelles daprès leur descriptif), 3 houblons, un titrage alcoolique de 10,5 % Abv et un niveau de sucre relativement élevé. On sort lartillerie lourde pour être certain de ne pas tomber hors sujet. Et en effet, cest bien dune bière certifiée de Noël qui en ressort avec toutes les caractéristiques attendues. Mais en empilant les extrêmes, Het Anker sest compliqué la tâche, car il en est dautant plus difficile dobtenir le bon équilibre. Mais mention spéciale tout dabord à létiquette grâce auquel nous sommes de suite dans lesprit de Noël avec un beau graphisme. En verre, cette bonne impression se confirme : brun profond surmonté dune mousse beige dun demi centimètre dépaisseur. Le nez est dune belle complexité sur le pruneau, le chocolat, la cerise au kirsh, les céréales, le café et la girofle, le tout sans fausse note. Lentrée en matière est très plaisante avec une attaque souple et suave sur des arômes de pruneaux et cerise amarena. La seconde bouche présente une amertume chaude sur des arômes complexes dorange, de pruneaux et dépices (girofle, gingembre, anis notamment), lensemble bien soutenu par une arrière bouche suave sur lananas confit et la cerise. Lalcool, extrêmement présent permet de donner cette impression de chaleur et une belle longueur. Que reprocher à cette bière alors ?!!! Simplement que les extrêmes se marient difficilement et que cela pose clairement un problème de lisibilité. Les épices sont fortes et donnent un caractère marqué à la bière en gâchant quelque peu lamertume. Lalcool également, trop présent, déstabilise lensemble (mais à la vue de lintensité des épices, un alcool moins fort naurait pas permis de soutenir lensemble). Et enfin le sucre dune densité importante pour adoucir à la fois les épices et lalcool et conférer la texture soyeuse à la bière lalourdit toutefois et pourrait paraître quelque peu désagréable en fin de dégustation (mais un plus faible niveau de sucre aurait rendu lensemble trop sec, eu égard à lalcool et aux épices). Je mettrai également un petit bémol au final, napportant rien de neuf, voire même, de par la puissance de lalcool, perdant en arôme. En conclusion : le mieux est lennemi du bien. A vouloir trop surenchérir, Het Anker en a perdu un peu lesprit de Noël. Surcharger son sapin de mille guirlandes, boules, et autres figurines ne le rend pas plus gracieux (cela le rend toutefois très attrayant, et il faut rendre à octave, ce qui appartient à octave, nous parlons dune bière de très bonne facture tout de même).","FRANCE","jybi"

Toujours limpression de boire une petite Chartreuse jaune au passage (avec de grosses notes danis, de badiane...) !

The smell I noticed as soon as I removed the cork. Anise in abundance. Its hard to get past that. Some sweet candi sugar notes. .

Anise, candi sugar, quite sweet this is. Okay, now that palate familiarity has set in, I can taste some dark pitted fruit goodness. Plum and raisin. Despite the temporary reprieve from the anise, I reckon that this Noel is too 1 dimensional for the style. 

High end of medium bodied, lively carbonated, more than a little boozy, this doesnt bring out any Christmas cheer for me. Super glad that I got a chance to try it.","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"

Mørk kastanjefarvet ufiltreret belgisk juleøl á la Strong Belgian Ale med fin moccafarvet skumtop på 1-2 cm, som svinder til kant og overflade efter et par minutter. Roligt glas øl.
Skøn vinøs aroma af blomme, rosin, portvin, alkohol. Sød- og syrlig på én gang.
Smagen er overvejende sødlig, men øllet er samtidig komplekst med en en fin balance mellem det søde og det bitre. Syrligheden spiller også fint inde.
Opsummering: solid kraftig sødme, medium bitter og let syrlig. Intet salt/umami her.
Stor fyldig krop, men en karbonering der - til min smag - er et nøk for kraftig. Øllet skummer meget i munden og vinder meget ved ""afbrusning"". I det hele taget kan det anbefales at åbne øllet i rigtig god tid og stå og lade det få de 12 grader før servering. Konsistensen er cremet til klæbrig og fedtet og eftersmagen dejlig lang, bittersød og gær'et.

Taste begins with a strong candi sugar-like sweetness, candied dates and candied cherries, medium carbonation, soft and chocolatey malt backbone upon which the mixture of ethereal spices is built: retronasally the peppermint, allspice, eucalyptus and so on return in all their glory, almost like cough syrup, after which a yeasty, malty, boozy finish develops, with a slightly coffee-like touch and some herbal hops. Its the candi-sweetness and the aromatic cough syrup spices which remain the longest, though. This is over the top even for a spiced winter warmer, but it has a kind of opulence making it worthwile to seek out.

2347,"2014-08-21",4.1,"Served on tap in a snifter

Appearance  Pours a chestnut/mahogany color with a two finger tan colored head. The head has a good level of retention slowly fading over time to leave a great level of lacing on the sides of the glass.

Smell  The aroma has a big spicy and roasty aroma. There is a strong roasted bready aroma mixed with notes of Christmas spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, anise and licorice). These stronger aromas are accompanied by notes of dark fruits, a lighter yeasty smell as well as a moderate presence of a boozy smell.

Taste  The taste starts with flavors a blend of roasted malt breadiness and some dark fruit flavors of raisin and prune. Spice flavors of nutmeg, licorice and anise then come to the tongue. At this point the tastes create a rather smooth flavor on the tongue. The breadiness and sweeter flavors of the dark fruits start to fade. A more red wine like flavor then starts coming to the tongue. It starts out light and smooth, but gets more tannin like in flavor as the taste moves to the end. At the end, the boozy taste is quite strong and with all the flavors it leaves a nice warming aftertaste that tasted somewhat like a mix of warming spiced mulled wine fruity brew to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is on the medium side in its creaminess for a brew of 10.5 % with a carbonation level that was a little on the higher side. for the style it was rather nice creating a good drinkability but yet keeping one in check of its strength.

Overall- This is a rather nice Belgian Christmas brew. It has a decent boozy flavor, but yet is still very flavorful and pleasant to drink.","","Darkmagus82"

Mais on va aller un peu plus loin.
Conditionnement superbe, étiquette, collerette, bouchon, lettres dor (normal
pour la « Gouden » Carolus!!!), tout y est pour la fête.
Couleur roux profond quasi opaque. 
Bulles par milliers partout dans le verre (jai choisi un Straffe Hendrik en forme
de tulipe assez relevée), très vives.
Superbe mousse beige caramel qui tient à 1 cm et dune texture très crémeuse.
Arômes de malt, tourbe, pointe danis très prononcée, associée à de la réglisse,
avec une pointe de cannelle et de candi noir.
1ère bouche quasi veloutée, où on a perdu un peu danis mais on a gagné du 
pruneau, des fruits confits, une pointe de pomme de terre verte et du malt à 
whisky...
2ème avec de labricot confit, ananas confits, et une pointe de kirsch.
3ème avec une belle complexité mais lanis domine, avec une pointe dun houblon
aromatique, un genre de myrrhe et de la réglisse.
La longueur développe une ampleur, mais lanis touche à leau de rose !!!! (aïe, aïe, aïe..)
La levure est complètement intégrée.
Lalcool, très fort, aide à la longueur.
La finale est danis  réglisse, anis  menthe, anis  muscade, anis  cannelle !!!!
Cette bière finit donc sur un excès, et dans les bières, un grand principe est :
point trop nen faut .
Le mélange dépices, méritoire puisquil y en a 6, est trop orienté sur lanis, ce qui
nuit à lensemble. Les houblons (4) bien quaromatiques sont noyés par les épices...
Cote très difficile donc, puisque cette bière est techniquement parfaite (bulles, mousse,
texture, alcool de 10,5 % qui participe à la longueur, etc.), mais beaucoup trop orientée
sur lanis quoique de saveurs complexes .

Overlaying all of this is a robust dosing of spices, which somehow compliment one another as well as the base, with anise most identifiable.

A bit more of a boozy warmer bite, though mild, balancing the sweetness.  Less obvious plum/date/raisin tones than Classic, more a general sweetness.

The beer appears dark chestnut brown with a formidable khaki head. Ample lacing and lasting head retention. The aroma offers malt, sweet spice, brown sugar, dark fruit, alcohol. Sweet breads, dark fruit, spices, malt, brown sugar, and Christmas cookies in the flavor. Quite sweet throughout - I am glad to be splitting this bottle. Licorice, candies, decadent holiday sweets, fruitcake. Complex and well done, though a bit cloying for my taste. The feel is thin to medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall, a bit too sweet, though well done and enjoyable. Best in small quantities.

The liquorice flavours that almost ruined my bottle review were almost completely gone, to be replaced by blackberries and plums.

The aroma was Port like with sweet molasses and Christamssy spices added, as was the rich taste and mouthfeel. Someone mentioned cough sweets in the beer tasting notes at the festival and that is a good choice of the words too. That liquorice flavour from my bottle review now coming back into play as the mouth dries giving the beer an alcoholic, malty, cough sweet sort of taste.

Anker matured this specially for two years, I thank them for that. 1st Review: Brown 33cl bottle, best before Nov 2009, drank Apr 2007. 

Poured into a Brugse Straffe Hendrik chalice. 

Lovelly dark ruby red, sadly the biege head soon departed leaving a scum, or if you like, a wisp on top of the body. 

The aroma was of sweet liquorice, nothing else could get past that smell in my bottle anyway. 

The taste was also of liquorice, but tempered with plums and Christmas spices. A sort of alcoholic liquid Christmas Pudding, with somebody adding liquorice. 

The flavour of liquorice stays forever, the mouthfeel is clingy and almost sickly, I had to have some Brie and salted biscuits half way through the beer to help me see it off. 

A warm fire and cold night beer, the liquorice almost ruined it for me, but it is never-the-less, a good Christmas beer. 

I think I have won the world record for mentioning liquorice in a beer review, please beermail me if you know different!","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

Anyhow, this little thing pours a lightly clouded deep deep ruby-red body with a small and sidesticking just off-white head. The aroma is really sticky-sweet!

It has a average carbonation level and a sticky to oily mouthfeel. Flavors also really strange! Lots of the same herbal-medicinal tones found in the aroma. Also its really sweet.

2347,"2010-12-24",4.2,"(Bouteille partagée avec Nicolas de Myre, cousin éloigné du Père Noël.  Nasdrovia!)  Le liquide a une robe brune.  La lumière du jour fait apparaître au contour du verre des reflets rouges.  La mousse se dépose pour quelques minutes et se transforme en un mince anneau.  Une dentelle est observable.  Au nez, les arômes maltés sont somptueux avec des parfums forts de réglisse et danis.  Des épices mélangées sont perceptibles et marquées notamment par la présence du girofle.  Lalcool reste bien dissimulé, de même que les houblons qui sont pratiquement introuvables. Des fruits foncés sévaporent et trouvent dans mes narines un refuge réconfortant.  Le goût est tout aussi complexe et encore touché par des saveurs maltées fruitées et caramélisées qui rappellent un petit gâteau aux fruits confits imbibé de rhum bien chaud.  Les épices chatouillent les papilles tandis que la réglisse est savoureuse comme un bonbon qui fond sur la langue.  Encore une fois, lalcool est introuvable, camouflé et pratiquement dangereux (10,5%!!!).   En bouche, le liquide a une structure étoffée, je dirais même corpulente, avec une effervescence parfaite et une texture qui est douce et crémeuse.

2347,"2010-12-23",4.0,"I poured a big bottle that was a little on the cold side into a chalice for the pleasure of smelling the different layers as it warmed to temperature. The aromas didnt disappoint, as an initial blast of Belgian yeast and brown bread gave way to warming alcohol notes that evoked tawny port. The flavors also opened as this warmed, from raisin and date to figs tinged with honey. A fine and complex beer. My only complaint, minor though it may be, comes from the appearance. This poured a lovely russet brown, but raised only a minimal head that quickly dissipated to a persistent ring and a bit of lacing. I enjoy seeing a frothy head on a Belgian ale, but I suspect that the combination of a high abv and the 2010 vintage saw to it that explosive refermentation had not done its work. In terms of nose and taste, though, this is just what you would want for an evening in the study after the wife and kid have gone to bed. That may make me a cliche, but it also makes me very happy.","Athens, Georgia, USA","bjt512"

2347,"2009-07-31",4.0,"750 ml. Rich and sweet strong ale, but far from cloying. Plenty of complexity. Hazy brown body with a frothy, light brown head that diminishes to tan pools. Aroma of dark fruits, plum, clove, cinnamon, orange peel. The flavor is heavily sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. The finish is moderately sweet and moderately bitter with some light acidity. The alcohol is not apparent until the finish and even then is far from upfront. You can taste the candy sugar and fruits and get a hint of licorice.

The aroma is great; full nutty and sweet notes; lots of sugary candies, but more rich fruity malts and caramel. The flavor is great as well; a rich creamy mouthfeel, caramel, light spices, rich fruity malts, strawberries and other fruit, light hops as well. Like a great Christmas cake. Nice.

Licorice and orange are the first think I noticed, good spice, very well balanced, minor amount of yeast which comes out more when warmer, a little bit of pepper, some sweet dark red candy, touch of caramel, really appealing There isnt much of a step down when it comes to the flavour: dark cherry, alcohol, mild anise, mild yeast taste, stiff spice but sweet too, caramel and raisin.

Lots of bubs are floating to the top of the brew that looks really think, all these bubbles are causing a churning effect on the surface of the beer and is pushing around small islands of foam in all directions. Very standard aroma for the style, sweet, touch of alcohol, spices, cherries, slight wood, and there is a aroma hiding in the back ground that reminds me of cigarette ash. Wow this stuff feels thick and the first sip warms the stomach. Taste is also very standard for the style but does stick out more in my mind than some. Sweet cherries just a touch of alcohol blends nicely with cinnamon and nutmeg, dark malts dominate this flavor and Im even detecting apples. Tasty brew, this would be a great sipper on a cold winter evening and not the summer heat wave I drank it in.

Unfortunately I think the palate is a little watery but its definitely the best Christmas beer in the world! 

However there is a big difference between the tap version, the 75cl bottle and the 33cl bottle. 

The 33cl bottle version is usually better carbonated, which makes the beer more smooth and harmonized.

2347,"2009-02-06",4.3,"THOUGHTS: My bottle said 10% ABV. Not overly Christmasy, but it was like a sweet candy treat for the holidays. Awfully clear for a bottle conditioned beer. No real sediment either. Not as good as the Grand Cru, but close. Hardly any hops anywhere. Bonus point for being better than the sum of its parts.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, dark brownish red that looked bright red in the light with a small to average, off-white head that mostly diminished and left virtually no lacing. The aroma was nice, but could have been stronger. There was moderate to heavy molasses and caramel malts, banana, raisin, apple, cherry, red wine, brown sugar, maple syrup, a little alcohol, candi sugar, sort of a rum flavor and other dark fruit. The flavor started very sweet, and finished sweet, ever so slightly bitter, sour and a little more sweetness with and average to long duration. There was caramel, candi sugar, raisin, cherry, apple, dark fruits of all kind, molasses, and maybe a little brown sugar. Very fruity, but it got a little cloyingly sweet, keeping it from being perfect. The medium body was slightly syrupy and sticky on the lips, then a little dry with very fizzy carbonation and a moderate alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

In long: The king of the malts outdo themselves with this brew.  This is a malt orgy with light spicy notes just to spice things up.  Toffee, molasses, caramel, more molasses, cloves, candied fruits, dark fruits, more heavy caramel, red fruits, and more toffee.  but the beer really doesnt feel very sweet.  Something must be drying it up, herbal spices and/or the well hidden hops (that I cant even detect)?

2347,"2007-12-24",4.4,"NorCal December 07 - An absolute pleasure of a beer to drink. Like Scaldis Noel, this beer is best savored during the later fall/winter months when its cold outside and you need some warmth inside. Aroma is brown sugar, caramel, green apples, bubblegum, and a touch floral. Mouthfel has a little harshness to it but gets better after a bit of breathing. Appearance is carmelized brown color, nice fluffy head with fantastic lacing. Flavors that dance on your tongue are brown sugar, caramel, ginger, dark fruits, licorice and alcohol. A slow, soft burn as the beer travels down your throat. A fantastic finish to a fantastic beer. Glad I have half a case of this.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

This Christmas ale is basically a modified version (i.e. more prominently spiced) of their exceptional Grand Cru. A dark, strong Belgian, the holiday taste comes courtesy of a quite subtle (and subtlety is too rare for these kinds of seasonals) incorporation of anise, clove, a hint of cinnamon and fig.

Aroma of sweet candy and anis is dominating and quite enjoyable and almost reminiscent of Rochefort. Taste is a nice mix between strong Belgian malt, sweet candy and anis. There is some sweetness but it never goes overboard and provides great balance with some light typical Belgian yeast.

2347,"2007-02-23",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2008 BB 03-10.  Pours a dark brown-red color with clarity and a fairly full, frothy, creamy, beige head; head is mostly lasing and leaves nice, tight lace.  Nose is fairly fruity and almost rum-soaked; anise is dominant with lighter notes of toffee, raisin, plum, light yeast, and some spicing (ginger/clove).  Flavor is complex and quite potent; still lots of anise with toffee, brown sugar, raisin, light cherry, clove, nutmeg, light yeast with some acidity and mild bitterness.  Palate was fair and detracted some from the unique flavors; lively, medium, but round with some noticable warmth from the alcohol.  Finishes still mostly sweet with anise, raisin, and brown sugar but also with a tobacco note (interesting but not unpleasant).  Palate and the overpowering anise notes do not allow this to be something special with so many wonderful flavors and complexities.  Very interesting and showing lots of potential; unexpected and surprisingly likable.  I tried this one aover a year ago and had something completly different: much more carbonation and less anise notes.  Both were interesing in their own right but both would be great with a bit of tweaking.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Theres some magical quality to the aroma that all Gouden Carolus beers seem to share... a mouth-watering, brown-sugary, spicy, malty sweetness.  The flavors of the Noel are similar to those of the Classic and the Grand Cru, but also present a heavy spiciness (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg), dried fruits (dates, plums, raisins, cherries), dark brown sugar, caramel, and a certain woody smokiness.  This beer is very complex and interesting.  The finish is somewhat astringent, and leaves behind an amazing tobacco-like, woody, smoky aftertaste.

2347,"2007-01-06",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 Of the three Noels I picked up for Christmas the Gouden Carolus stood out as the weakest.  In retrospect it seems regrettable because it presents such a wide pantheon of tastes, but none of them work in concert.  It fulfills neither the Christmas spirit, nor any secular day of festive drinking, and so was cast into the shadows of the two other Noels and left to ponder its mistakes.  The head is thin but soft as goose down, and maybe even softer than the calm, soothing narrative voice of Morgan Freeman.  The Noel itself is a little less comforting, taking the unmistakable shade of red of human blood.  Freshly ground black pepper and hops lead the aromatic charge, sending the drinker reeling with its pungency.  Then it mellows with a very dairy phase, smooth and silky like cream and a bit funky like good stinky cheese.  A little banana is thrown into the fray to sweeten things up, but gently enough that it doesnt trespass on the aforementioned cream, and then a little coke to rough it up with even more sweetness but of a more calloused and inveterate kind.  Theres also a nice smell that borderlines between plum and wine, and after that a few dashes of spice, including cumin with its distinct association with chili, and a smattering of nutmeg.  Its a very raucous smell, but lacks cohesion, losing some of its potential for excellence.  It is, however, well matched to the taste which maintains a kinship to its more gaseous counterpart while maintaining enough difference to give it something to show for itself.  The banana makes a triumphant return but this time holding hands with a dark malty figure.  Its a fun pairing and reminds me of a lot of chocolate-banana combo desserts, like the hallmark banana split.  Then this simple pairing slides down to a spicy and peppery stage reversing the order of the smell, before collapsing into a surprisingly simple, quiet and anti-climactic yeastiness.  The whole sequence is flavored with allspice, juniper and cardamom, but it ends up being too spicy, and very similar to excess alcohol ends up eclipsing more flavors then it complements.  I see a lot of expression and a lot of brewers frustrations, but its simply too many flavors all at once without any direction or precision.  It seems fuzzy and chaotic, and even worse, purposeless.  Its hard to describe, but I like a beer thats confident with itself, and determined enough to have a specific agenda.  The Gouden Carolus Noel seems a bit confused, and may need time to straighten itself in preparation for Decembers to come.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
2347,"2007-01-06",3.8,"A priori, Gouden Carolus takes a simple but elegant approach, showing deep Burgundy hues and a clean off-white coiffure - the mark of a quiet noblesse, a certain feminine flair begging wordlessly with powdered cheeks. Up close, it is a grand perfume that exudes. A symphony of spices, soft yet striking, translated on the nose as allspice, saffron and black pepper. Sweet esters appear with agility: banana, bubble gum, lemon, a hint of minty pine and maraschino cherries forming melodious legato. It seems, however, that darkness lurks. A touch of fig, the ripeness of raisins, caramel orchestrating transparently; this context allows the springy fragrances to sing even louder and echo tumultuously in the mouth. The burning spiciness of black pepper, orange peel, nutmeg, anise and saffron combined initially overwhelm the tongue, forming a voluptuous cacophony, a sudden and deafening climax. Soon, interwoven subtleties begin to appear, tones of bread and wood, fig, prune, bacon, cherry and banana. Sip after sip, as the ale warms its body becomes smoother, individual spices begin to dissociate, its flavor lingers long after the swallow. The rhythm progressively slows until the last drop is consumed. Beer is sometimes a sensual experience.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Grape currant gets boiled down into a plum paste. Daisies twine into a broiled concord bed being charged with charred cocoa beans stuffed with raisins. Nutmeg gets tossed into a pruney, dark ginger and rye bread compound. Fluffy mouthfeel and supportive effervescence to the flavorful stream.

2347,"2006-12-26",4.0,"Pours very deep, dark brown (nearly opaque) with a lovely tan head consisting of very fine bubbles that lace the glass heavily. The aroma starts strongly with bubble gum, freshly mowed grass, and funky, funky yeast. Some malt and dark fruit also make a subdued appearance. The flavor starts off spicey - nutmeg and licorice. It is sweet on the tip of the tongue, too, though also quite carbonated and tingly. The middle of the tongue shows some acidity, lots of fruit (banana, prune), sweet malts with the brief suggestions of caramel and chocolate, and more tingly carbonation. The finish is dry and full of alcohol, but also other flavors like caramel, spice, more fruit, and yeast. The mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for a beer that is this strong and sweet (no doubt thanks to dark candi sugar) and it is very highly carbonated. As I swirl the beer in its snifter, agitating it to release carbon dioxide, the mouthfeel gets smoother and creamier. Overall, very nice and quite memorable.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

2347,"2006-12-25",3.6,"Rating number 600.
Last night was a 2004 bottle of Gouden Carolus Cuvee de Kaiser; tonight (Christmas day 06) this 2006 bottle of Noel. 

As before, the cork comes out with an explosive pop, though maybe not with quite the force of last night. The beer pours nicely but not with the full elegance of the other.

The aroma offers rich dark caramel again; orange zest and a bit of spice,  dried fruit -- and the flavor comes through with bits of all of these, though dominated by spice and alcohol. Perhaps in part, the flavors of this young beer have not yet had time to meld and soften adequately.
The mouthfeel is adequate though not quite as luscious as the Cuvee de Kaiser, and overall the beer - while nice - pales in comparison that other offering from the same brewery.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Very drinkable for a 10% abv beer. A great Christmas brew to sip and savor by a roaring fire.

Rich sweet malt and dark fruits flood the nose. There is a musky perfumey flourish as well. Body is a murky brown and holds two fingers of mocha thickness in the creamy, but bubbly, head.

Aroma is delicious and potent: sweet malts, plums, raisins, dates, and figs mixed with some spices but not overpoweringly so.  I like the fact that it doesnt have that yeasty orangy smell/taste that many belgians do.  Flavor is extremely sweet and malty with alcohol notes and a dry bitter finish.

On the nose are aromas of herbs, spices, anise, clove, fruit esters, alcohol, bready yeast and malt. The flavor is most complex -- against an earthy backdround, theres a malt smokiness blended with a berry sweetmess and a malty caramel, some treacle/brown sugar, the blend of 6 herbs and spices (I taste cardamon, ginger star anise, sweet woodruff, and caraway), and a warm complex 3-hop finish. The alcohol is not that evident. Mouthfeel is delisciously thick and chewy, slow to release carbonation, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste.

Very spiced, with some cardamon and absolutely no indication whatsoever of its 10% alcohol.

Spicy and sweet nosenot unlike root beertoffee, nutty and very lightly roasted; ginger and nutmeg in the background.  Begins quite sweet with caramel and malt before a soft acidity, eventually thinning out into a lengthy finish of spices, lightly bitter and roasty.

2347,"2005-03-20",4.5,"Everything about this beer seems to be black - color is a super blackened ruby oil capped by a tall, softly whipped yet lumpy, cinnamon dusted, light tan head. Settles off to a thin, uneven skim and the lacing is whimsically placed in thin and webby broken sheeting.

Aroma is airy and pleasantly soft yet robust of black licorice, dirt, and the blackest of black malts without much sweetness at all. Cindering hints of bright pepper phenols and anise percolate right over the top.

Taste nearly mirrors the aroma with a tender sweet black malt, fainter dark fruity nuances, and cola sryup masked in a ever present black licorice spice. Finishes with shadowy cinnamon, anise, ginger, minty skoal tobacco juice, earthy pine needles; quick, yet muffled, phenol laced alcoholic heat, some leftover cola sweetness and a drying of light throat burning sweetness. 

Complexly characterized in girth that sits just above a medium body but somehow keeps a general softer sweetness and spice thats magnificently handled. Lots of subtle spicy layering and a finely heated throat burn, belly warming, and mind-boggling play between sweet and dark; and, warm and spicy. Fun stuff. It really grows on ya as you engage in its presence.

Even with all its finely set warming and spice this makes for a really nice drinker and an even finer treat. Im becoming more of fan to these Noel/Winter Warmer-type brews and Im thinking Winter isnt really that bad here in MN as long as I have this kind of beer around to keep me company.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

The high alcohol is fairly well hidden, although there is some warming in the swallow.  There is an odd candy flavor that I am not able to place, and some spicyness. Tasty and interesting.

2347,"2004-12-06",4.8,"Vintage 2003, matured on keg for one year.

The colour is clear brown with a small hint of red. The firm beige foam is two-finger thick and made of medium sized bubbles. 

The smell is very complex and intense: Among the flavours I noticed marzipan, dark rum, cinnamon, caraway, preserved cherries, milk chocolate and a full apple pie. Wow!

The carbonation is robust and grand with small bubbles.

The taste starts with some sweet lactose-notes that slowly change into a full-bodied taste of apple pie, complete with cinnamon and butter. There is a slight flavour of alcohol, but it isnt dominating at all. The long and multifaceted aftertaste includes such flavours as sweet Madeira wine, candid apples, clotted cream and, for that special contrast, a hint of bitter hops. 

This is indeed a world-class yuletide beer. Yummy!

I talked to the publican at The Rover (in Gothenburg, Sweden) about this beer. He had stored it for a year in his cellar, just for fun. At that point, he wasnt even sure that the beer had survived the maturing! We agreed that the keg probably needed to settle for a few days to reduce the carbonation a little.","Linköping, SWEDEN","bark"

The cork basically shot out of the bottle when opened, indicating a very effervescent beer inside. Served in my Chimay chalice for full effect. Rich aromas of the season, such as nutmeg, cinnamon, yeasty bread, rum soaked raisins, brandy soaked dark fruits like figs, dates, and plums. Poured out a murky light brown color, with a decadent oatmeal colored head. Thick lacing evident along the sides of the glass, along with a mat of yeasty islands floating in the middle. Tastes are of Christmas in a glass. Grandma's special brandy soaked fruitcake, in liquid form.
Absolutely heavenly in both taste & texture. Incredibly rich mouthfeel, silky & smooth. Spicy yeast makes for an interesting combination with the strong malt backbone. Finishes dry, and somewhat sweet, but not cloying. A really great choice on my part for today.","","Cobra"

Bottle from same batch as my previous entry (2003, dec 14) Only now aged for 4,5 years. The beer becomes more porty and dusty and looses some of the heavy laurel/licorice flavor. So the beer has gained more balance and complexity.  I would say my conclusion 4,5 years ago was correct.

Plum aromas mixed with alcoholic rum like notes escape as I pour this lightly hazy amber-brown beer.  A dense tan to light brown head tops the Noël.  There are some notes of dried fig in the aroma as well, overall a phenomenally enticing aroma to this beer, and I have yet to taste it.The taste; a rich brew, though light bodied given its 10.5% alcohol by volume, by no means light though.  There is some definite spiciness here, seems like some coriander along with some other spices have been used, though because this beer is so rich and fruity it may just be the Belgian yeast character.  This beer finishes with a definite alcoholic bite, though it is not overbearing and goes well with the spice notes.  Lightly sweet with raisin and other dark fruit notes are in the fore front of this beer.  There is no real bitterness, the spices and alcohol counter-point the sweetness and fruity flavors.  This beer is incredibly good, and incredibly under-rated.  I am certainly going to get a couple more bottles of this to age, next winter these could be stunning.

2347,"2003-01-20",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2003 ReRate: 750 corked [2003 fresh]:Murky mahogany copper rests in the glass as a patch-work of wispy taupe coloured clouds disperse like the Pangaea of old. . . The aroma fills my nostrils and head with sharp anise, nutmeg, tea leaves, cherry skin and fruity dough.  Full spicy flavour that begins with white grape skin, buttered toast , bitter cranberries and finishes with coarse black pepper and other spices.

Orginal [2002 fresh] (3.5): Dark brown, minimal head, but lingering. . . Nice nutty/malty aroma. . . Good amount of alcohol on the palate, good spices in the back of the mouth and on the way down.  Lingering malty flavours with some fruit, another great Christmas present.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
2347,"2003-01-19",4.4,"Very tasty ale.  Malty and creamy, the mouthfeel is so soft that you hardly know it's there.  The aroma is fantastic, I don't know what it is but it smells great.  I need an air freshener that smells like this.  10.5% very well hidden. I like this brewery so far.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
2347,"2003-01-18",3.6,"The aroma is malty and soapy with notes of caramel, yeast, winter spices and a whisper of mint and alcohol.
Sparkling clear, deep ruby hue with a copper tint. Large, frothy khaki-colored head. Mostly lasting with very impressive lacework.
The flavor starts with pears and fuzzy fruits with blasts of caramel, toffee and butter. Nicely balanced with light bitterness on the backside. The high ABV is fairly well-hidden.
Medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Medium-length, acrid and dry finish.
Very good Belgian ale excepting an unfamiliar, and not entirely welcomed, hop or spice addition.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2347,"2003-01-17",3.6,"Pours a deep red color with a nice tan/off-white head.  The aroma is sweet and fruity, marked by apples, cherries, prunes, raisin, and alcohol.  Nice fruit in the flavor, but also a bit of nut, whole grain, caramel and subtle spices.  A nice holiday brew even though it's been awhile.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
2347,"2003-01-03",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 18, 2004 2002:  Light chestnut. Dense, rocky, light tan foam.  Fruitcakey malt amid oodles of plum, fig, and bubblegum notes. Hints of icorice, ginger, butter rum, clove, aniseed, mint, and rock candy. Firm, velvety carbonation. Chewy. Huge fruitiness mixed of aniseed and  plummy malts. Traces of mint and ginger. Beautiful finish shows long notes of caramel malt breadinesss and licorice. Lingering fruitcake flavors with soft spices.There's nothing quite like this. A winner of a holiday brew.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2347,"2002-12-29",3.2,"Medium brown color with a good sized head sittin atop.  Muted dark flavors with black licorice, plum, raisins, and some cherries.  Noticable alcohol with some balanced hops.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"

2347,"2002-12-26",3.7,"Dark amber/garnet color with a bit of cloudiness.  Tan foamy head.  Spicy aroma with licorice dominating. AS this one warms smells more like night time cold medicine.  Tastes like licorice infused date.  Nice solid mouth feel.  Unfortunately I am not a fan of either  licorice or date.   This is a well made beer, but it contains flavors I do not favor. 
For the right person, this is a awesome beer, bbut my overall is a personal one.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
2347,"2002-12-23",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2003 Totally different after aged a year. It was a black licorice catastrophe but now yields delicious flavors of ripe plums and juicy raisons. Alcohol is better masked and aftertaste is complex and yeasty.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
2347,"2002-12-20",3.3,"Reddish body, huge head, sweet malty and fruity nose. My second 10+ ABV of the night; not a good idea. ;) Lots of fruit in the body, with some mild spice. Pretty good stuff.","Buffalo, New York, USA","estoppel"
2347,"2002-12-17",4.4,"Hazy red brown body with big light beige head.  Aroma is sweet, anise and alcohol -- the mix comes out something like spiked root beer.  Flavor is much the same -- rich, sweet, anise and root beer, with pleasant alcohol flavor.  Delicious winter brew!","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2347,"2002-12-14",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2014 750mL bottle (Jun 2014 bottling). Head is initially large, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting. Body is hazy dark brown, bottle conditioned. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (caramel, toasted grain/bread/pastry), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with light notes of sassafras, peppermint, anise/fennel, raisin, cinnamon. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety/watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

Not as good as the 2013 batch...the nose is quieter and simpler, and it seems a bit more watery in texture...the 2013 was richer, more luxurious, and more complex. Still very nice, especially in the flavor balance (most of these things are overly sweet), for a spiced Belgian strong ale, but not a 4+ this time.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2347,"2002-12-10",4.3,"Bottled. Dark amber. Intense and complex nose; esters, port, dried fruit and banana. Reasonably dry and malty with lightly bitter finish. An excellent ale full of character!","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
2347,"2002-12-10",4.0,"Dark -deep coulour with obvious reddish shine. Nose of madeira, raisins, roasted malts and molasses. Taste immediately spritzy acidity, then fruity & estery. In aftertaste fruity character has again fruit-acids in it. Palate is however thinnish, but with alcohol-throatwarming effect.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
2347,"2002-12-06",3.2,"This was great to smell and look at, but there wasnt much substance to it.  Rather bland in the mouth and acutally too smooth if one can picture something with not much taste, but easily drinkable.  I liked it and recommend it, but there are better examples out there.","Pennsylvania, USA","Prostman"
2347,"2002-11-29",4.4,"Brilliant red amber beer with a medium creamy head. Spicy, koriander?, aroma. Very spicy, sweet full taste. A wonderful beer.","Mol, BELGIUM","Kåstå"
2347,"2002-11-22",3.0,"Bizarre spices.  Candyish, but its got a bit of smokiness.  Almost meaty, in some strange way.  Cant identify it, but didnt particularly enjoy it.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
