955,"2017-06-17",4.3,"He querido elegir la Westvleteren Blond para mi nota de cata nº100 en RateBeer. Vamos allá! Botella en 99Cervezas.

Vierte en dorado pajizo, brillante y bastante transparente (salvo una turbidez inicial por frío), con abundante espuma de adherencia y persistencia medias. Buena carbonatación, con multitud de hilos de burbujas mucho tiempo después de servida.

De intensidad media en nariz, da de entrada algunas notas de plátano fresco, pan blanco, algunas notas herbales y un punto cítrico. Poco después aparecen notas de manzana y el punto de hierba fresca se refuerza. Complejidad media o no. Deja que evolucione y se atempere ligeramente y la cerveza cambia a lo belga. Aparecen entonces notas agrestes, casi animales y un puntito rancio interesantísimo. La cerveza cambia mucho conforme pasan los minutos. Increíble evolución!

Muy sorprendente en boca, destacando entre los sabores básicos el amargo, ligeramente astringente, algo acre y hasta con un punto picantito. El dulce y un punto salado están también presentes de fondo, dando una estupenda base al amargo. Hay cervezas que en boca confirman lo que en nariz anunciaban y hay cervezas que te sorprenden, esta es una de las últimas. Fantástico e inesperado sabor! Al igual que en nariz, después de unos minutos evoluciona ganando en notas animales y en carácter.

De peso medio-ligero en boca y textura aterciopelada (en plan a contrapelo, ciertamente). Carácter refrescante. Buena bebestibilidad, incluso después de evolucionar en boca y ganar carácter, lo que resulta tremendamente meritorio. Enorme persistencia y final muy seco. No te cansas de ella.

Una maravilla de cerveza, y una sorprendente evolución en nariz y en boca. Toda una experiencia que todo buen aficionado debería conocer. Total y absolutamente recomendable.","Valencia, SPAIN","JuanCC"

955,"2017-04-27",4.6,"Might be ""the basic beer for the monks own consumption"", but Im finding nothing basic about Westvleteren Blond at all. Perhaps the best pure example of a Belgian single available, Westie Blond hits all the bright, grassy hefe notes you want from a traditional golden Trappiste ale, yet also brings along wonderfully deep Belgian esters to the mix, reaching the perfect ratio of banana to clove against a red apple sweetness. Modest floral hop finish, and the fade gives up bready yeast and a lingering but restrained sweet roll undercurrent. As gorgeous as a beer can be, and the feels perfect. I understand why Westvleteren 12 gets all the attention, but Im a Blond guy through and through.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

Cor dourada, com turbidez dentro do estilo, creme de boa formação. Aroma frutado, lembrando frutas amarelas. Na boca, carbonatação bem presente, entregando uma breja equilibradissima, com dulçor controlado e amargor bem evidente. Talvez seja uma das trapistas mais lupuladas que já tomei. Notas terrosas, herbáceas. Final seco, altíssima drinkability. Enfim, uma Breja para se contemplar mesmo. Complexidade e sutileza se blendam nos 5.8% de álcool, perceptíveis somente no final do gole. Uma pérola esquecida dessa respeitada cervejaria belga. Agradeço aqui o sograo por ter trazido esse presentasso de viagem. Cheers! 4.75/5

955,"2015-11-17",4.6,"Chris opened this treasure tonight. Let me try to express how amazing that is. This is, I believe, the only beer that (1) was on my wants list almost immediately after joining the site 10 years ago, and (2) that I still havent tried, and (3) I still want to try. That makes it a pretty rare bird and pretty great thing to get to drink.

Absolutely gorgeous pour, glowing gold with a small white head into...yes...a Westy chalice. The nose is dust and hay, enticing. The flavor is spectacular. Its very dusty, just the way I love Belgian farmhouse beers, but its also spectacular in its intense orange rind of the sort that you get in a good tripel. But its got absolutely none of the sweetness of some tripels, none of the fruity esters. Instead its just bone dry, with a cider-like aspect that is very unusual among the 2000+ beers that Ive had. The mouthfeel is right on the mark for weight on the tongue. Not thick and sticky, not thinner than one would like.

Sipping this I drift off into a fantasy where Ive living in rural Belgium and this is the local equivalent of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, where you can just crack bottle and bottle and drink deep while hanging out with your friends...aaah. So nice.

Chris, thank you enormously for sharing this treasure.  Unlike whatever  random Scandinavian double imperial stouts and Midwestern tap-only IPAs I had on my wants list a decade ago, this one has stood the test of time.

Underbody of freshly baked bread & milled cereal grains. Very nice. Flavor follows the same path but is slightly more understated. Zesty herbal grass, moderate floral notes, lemon zest, mild peppery phenolic spices, gummy yeast, slightly fruity esters, & a timid, earthy bitterness in the finish. Just a hint of seemingly metallic astringency hits on the very back-end, but it doesnt ruin the experience. Kind of a minor nuisance. Bone dry finish; herbal hay remnants left behind.

Blijft een geweldig biertje. Bestel hem standaard als ik naar Westvleteren rijd om bier te gaan halen. Telkens een rit van 2x170 kilometer, toch elke keer geweldig als daar zon heerlijk blond westvleteren op je staat te wachten. Heb er inmiddels thuis ook enkele bakken van staan, super om na een dag studeren dit biertje te kunnen drinken in de warme zomermaanden.

Uiteindelijk kost een krat van dit heerlijk bier 30euro, wat goedkoper is als een bak westmalle tripel, maar stuk duurder dan bvb een bak westmalle extra. Persoonlijk vind ik hem qua smaak hier ergens tussen inzitten. Ook al valt een tripel niet echt te vergelijken met dit, anderzijds zou een tafelbier zoals de extra nooit op een lijn durven te zetten met deze. Het zal toch een beetje de mythe rond de blonde westvleteren zijn die er mij toe aanzet geregeld naar ginder te rijden om enkele van deze bakken op te halen.","BELGIUM","DavidBe"

Bananig-gelb im Glas, toller frischer Geruch nach Banane, Hefe und frischem Hopfen. 
Der Antrunk ist CO²-reich, voluminös-vollmundig, und wie der Geruch verspricht hefig-bananig-mild. Sehr angenehm mild. Dazu kommt ein schönes frisches Hopfenaroma, das sich im Hauptteil noch weiter verstärkt. Dort macht sich dann auch eine moderate Herbe breit, die sehr gut zu dem süßlich-bananig-hefigen Grundcharakter des Bieres passt und zum Ende hin erstaunlich deutlich ausfällt ohne jedoch zu stumpf-herb zu wirken. 
Das Bier gibt sich blumig-herb auf der Zunge, im Nachgeschmack domoniert die blumig-aromatische Herbe zusammen mit der hefig-milden Süße. 
--> ein sehr leckeres blondes Trappistenbier. Schmeckt voller und mir daher besser als das vergleichbare, aber um 1% «schwächere» Westmalle Extra.

A: pours a golden ale with near brilliant clarity. Single finger of creamy foam falls to a thick quilt of the same which wraps the entire course of the drink. Cobweb lacing. 

S: grain, yeast, sweet Belgian sugar, rice, some really nice floral tones. I like. 

T: more bitter than anticipated. Very clean, fresh grain flavors. A hint of peppercorn on the finish for me. Like a tea, quite refreshing.

955,"2013-12-09",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2016 9/12/2013 Bottle shared with harrisoni in the Westvleteren Cafe. Wow, what a beer. So Ian built this one up for me as an amazing beer and to be honest I was sceptical about a Belgian blond. However it is a revelation and took some of the shine off my crates of Westy 12, as I suddenly wanted some of this to take home too. Gives me something to look forward to next time. Very bright amber and fresh looking beer. Up close theres tiny specks of grain in the hazy beer. Bright head is medium to full, and fluffy and light. Nose is a big burst of fresh citrousy lemony hops, with citrous acidic, pithy lemon and satsuma, crisp yeast. Taste is a big burst of lemony hops, crisp Belgian yeast. Its light, effervescent and leaves a tingling lemon citrous bitterness on the tongue well after sipping. Lovely finish. Theres also a little bit of lemon curd creaminess to it. Light as a feather and bursting with citrousy hop. This is a great beer and probably the best Belgian blonde beer Ive had by a long way. Re-rate - bottle at home. Clear golden blonde beer with a thin white head. Has bubbles and floaty bits in it. Nose is stunning. Perfumed, rich cereal grains, fresh cut straw, tangerine fruit, peach and apricot, slight farmyard, tropical fruit. Taste is a big wave of summer. Fresh cereal grains, straw, grass, farmyard , honey mead, acidic green hop, grapefruit and lemon rind. such a delicate beer.

A: This trappist ale is a hazy, yellow or straw hue. The beer is extremely effervescent, with bubbles rising in rapid ascension to the surface. There, the bubbles encounter a mammoth head seemingly comprised of sea foam and whipped meringue.

S: The aroma is potent, wonderful and full of bitter hops in the Belgian style, a la Belgian IPA.

T: This beer tastes fabulous. I am pleased, but not surprised, as I consider Brouwerij Westvleteren to be one of the finest breweries on the planet. There is a slight funk and/or yeastiness that adds another layer of complexity. There is a strong hop presence throughout the aroma and every step of the taste. Its also worth mentioning that this 5.8% Belgian pale ale was bottled nearly two years ago and held up like a champ. Absolutely delicious.

I thought it a bit young in the taste, meaning it needed longer to mature in the bottle. I have two older ones in my stash, but wanted to review the beer when in date, Ill have the other ones soonest though, as this Westy doesnt age too well, or so Im told.

Pleased Ive used the glass at last and the lesser of the Brothers beers gets a thumbs up from me, not huge scores, but Im a low marker compared to most.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

955,"2012-04-05",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 28, 2014 Bottle. Hazy, yellow/hay liquid with medium to big white head. Aroma is spicy with notes of banana, red berries, noble hops, wheat and cereal malt. Taste is very light, quite dry and light bitter with very light tartness. Notes of belgian yeast esters and wild strawberries. Light bodied with nice carbonation. Quite balanced and not too sweet, though quite dull. 3.6 score.
Re-rating june 2014. Bottle at In de Vrede. Fresh as it comes, and a totally different beast than the bottle I had roughly two years ago. Same appearance but so different otherwise. Freshly hoppy aroma of citrus, flowers and some light fruity esters. Very effervescent with some light malt background. Taste is dry and refreshingly bitter with noble hops dominating. Extremely quaffable and refreshing. Body is just enough to not feel watery with a high but balanced amount of carbonation. As good as pale Belgian ales come. Hoppy, refreshing and awesome. Better than both the 8 and 12 fresh.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","VsXsV"

955,"2012-02-16",4.6,"Currently drinking while typing. After a long wait I have finally got hold of one, two of each Westvleteren variety infact! After pouring you will come across a very interesting aroma which almost smells faintly like a tin of baked beans! Fresh scents of citrus, yeast, sprucey hops, faint sugars and a generally light and delicate aroma, nothing huge although very interesting! Clear bright golden vessel with a gentle haze, on top is a creamy white head that was initially bubbled but settled into a relatively well lasting head. The flavour is incredibly moreish! Subtle but yet still very interesting, as a blond you expect typical flavours but instead you have a great structure with overall savoury delight! Flavours of gentle bitterness, cereals, hops, yeast, soft spices, malts, lots of grains/cereals in the back and a lasting but subtle savoury grains and hop aftertaste very similar to a witbier. The beer is smooth, silky, full and perfectly carbonated making it ever so refreshing, it has everything you expect it to in terms of mouthfeel. Extremely good beer, as much as I dont like agreeing to typical hypes, this beer really makes it hard to defy my mind.

Smell: Not the most overwhelming array of aromas, but the yeast is definitely there. Citrus and wild fields. 

Taste: Excellent. Peppery and wild and funky and refreshing. Another review mentioned a hint of Orval, and Id say thats pretty spot on. The floral components from the hops have a nice balance. I get a little bit of the pine and dryness, but only as a compliment to the base of the beer (which is the yeasty profile.) The back end suitably lingers for a bit, begging me to take another sip.

955,"2011-12-18",4.1,"Location: Bottle from St. Sixtusabdij, 12/18/11, Rating # 2000, Just like Y2k, the world will not come to an end as I rate this one.  Ive been saving this one for a while, it was purchased in the summer of 10, and I thought rating 2000 would be a great time to break it out.  (I actually enjoyed one at In de Vrede - where I had all 3 of their beers, but this rating is based on the at-home bottle experience.)


Aroma: The nose has some fruity, spice, and Belgian yeast aromas to it, with clove and floral notes

Appearance: This one pours a cloudy golden-orange color with a small, fizzy white head and medium lace

Flavor: Execellently balanced taste made up of the spice, yeast, floral and fruit flavors, nice hop presence

Palate: The body is medium here, it has a really nice mouthfeel, and a tingly, somewhat dry, hop finish to it

Overall Impression: 
I remeber the sheer enjoyment of drinking this one (and the 8 and 12) in Westvleteren, and I wondered if this beer would live up to my lofty memories.  I poured it into one of my Westvleteren glass, because it wouldnt make sense to drink it anything.  It really does live up to the hype.  An excellent, complex Blond Ale.  The components just all really work well together to show what this style has the capability to be.  A great offering, and a wonderful way to tick off my 2000th rating!","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

955,"2011-07-11",4.3,"A - An exquisite looking Belgian Pale Ale. The appearance is exactly what you would expect a blonde to be. There is an orange-yellow look to this beer with a white head (about 1/4 of a finger of head with this beer on a fairly aggressive pour). Color is very reminiscent of champagne with carbonation trailing up the sides of the snifter glass. 

S - a very complex smell that you would usually find with other brands quadrupels. You can really smell dark fruits in this one. Some yeast and cellar funk (others will call this barnyard funk, but I have had occasion to smell this particular scent before and it was in a cellar). Faintly sweet smelling as well. 

T - Very good for a belgian pale ale. If I was going for a pale ale, this would be my choice (although this style of beer isnt my overall favorite). Around 40 degrees drinking temperature, the dark fruits dominate the taste. You can also taste the yeast in there as well. A slight tinge of sweetness, but nothing you wouldnt notice without really looking for it. As the beer warms up, the dark fruits come forward even more and the beer becomes even smoother. A real pleasant surprise. 

M - very smooth mouthfeel to this beer. Wow, is this smooth. You can feel the carbonation as you swish it around your mouth and cannot really feel the booziness of this beer until you let it sit your stomach for a while. 

O - While the not the overall best beer that I have ever had, this beer is near the top. Top in its style that I have had. Its just very smooth overall and very drinkable. I was very pleasantly surprised to note some dark fruits in this beer as I would with quadrupels. Just a testament to the genius of the monks of the St. Sixtus Abbey.","Florida, USA","ajcobb24"

Kinda cigarettey in a way. Flavor is much better. Dry pale malts provide a nice background for the ludicrous hop bitterness. Ive had less bitter IPAs. This is awesome.

It pours a hazy almost grayish-yellow with a tight traditional head which is easily reinvigorated with a swirl.  How wonderful this aroma is, so superbly floral, fresh and evocative (the old wine term ""terroir"" applies).  Here are fields in summer, hay stacked high in barns and flowers in bloom.  But under this, anchoring it to the earth, is the yeast.  And it is the yeast that first impresses on the palate, being fruity and pleasingly doughy.  This balances out the hops and gives added depth to an otherwise mostly dry beer.  Its exceedingly rounded and so very drinkable.  The hop aromas carry through and develop with the yeast to end on a perfumed finish.  Of course one has to address the allure of Westvleteren and I can hardly add anything new to the debate, only to say that amidst the hype this beer remains humble.

Medium bodied and surprisingly hop forward, especially since this bottle has been aged for about four years. Im picking up the zesty, peppery spice that I noticed in the aroma as well the bready yeast and fruit notes, especially apple and pear.

BB 20.October 2010, into Orval chalice.
The pour produces luminous snow /egg meringue white head that collapses into solid sheet over the entire surface of hazy straw yellow to extremely pale orange-brown fluid with translucent, almost watery appearance. Swirls wave fabrics of bright lace which is short lived apart from individual patches sliding down the walls.
Aromas are of apples, hops and barn yard funkiness. The mild flavor profile is an interplay of apple tartness and hoppy bitterness enhanced by faint juniper. Slightly astringent.
The light bodied brew with restrained carbonation is thin and shallow and fails to match my mental picture of Westvleteren blond ale. However, the beer is very clean and refreshing so I can easily imagine it being the monks table beer for daily consumption.
Overrated, overpriced and nowhere close to Orval.","SLOVENIA","EvilBuddha"

Taste light fruits and spices - really tastes like a somewhat watery tripel.  Alcohol not apparent.  Nice smooth and carbonated palate.  Clean finish with slight bitterness.

Not a bad beer, but really none of the legendary Westvleteren mystique here.","Iowa, USA","Rando7"
955,"2010-10-25",3.7,"Belgian beers, especially Trappist beers (made by monks) are known for being intense, complex, sippers. But why cant they make a lighter, more direct, and refreshing brew for casual drinking? I guess thats the idea behind Westvleteren Blond. Its got the basic characteristics of the Trappist ales, but without the intensity or prerequisites that come with most beers of the sort.NOTE: Of all the Westvleteren beers, the Blond is not meant to be aged (according to the monasterys website). The bottle I drank was purchased in February of 2009, although the original buyer isnt sure when it was brewed and bottled. Its possible I was not drinking this beer the way it was meant to be served.APPEARANCE AND AROMAI poured an 11.2oz bottle into a Trappist chalice. The beer is lively and bubbly with a bright orange/yellow body with tons of tiny Belgian bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Although the beer is not intended for extended cellaring, it is bottle-conditioned as plenty of yeast can be seen in the bottle and even leaves a brown stain in the otherwise bright white, fluffy, head. The aroma is a little weak. I notice a typical Belgian blond scent not unlike Duvel of light fruit and yeast, but there also seems to be a touch of skunkiness (again, this could be due to the age of my bottle).TASTEWhen drinking a Trappist beer one of the first things you notice is how much flavor they deliver immediately. Westvleteren Blond is a bit different than the others as its flavor doesnt make itself known right away, but shows up in the finish and aftertaste. As it crosses my palate I get hints of fruit and yeast, but its otherwise mild. Whats interesting is that its actually very refreshing while its in my mouth.The majority of the flavor comes on the backend. I notice three distinct green fruits: white grape; Granny Smith apple and green pear. The only caveat is I have to reach for those flavors. Perhaps if I were drinking a fresher bottle these flavors would be more robust and more satisfying. As the beer warms the fruitiness becomes a bit stronger, but the yeast presence becomes drier. Theres a lingering dry bitter aftertaste from this beer, but its easily ignorable.DRINKABILITYAlthough my frame of reference with Trappist beers is rather limited, I would be surprised if I encounter a monks brew lighter and/or more refreshing than Westvleteren Blond. The first few sips have that peppery mouthfeel Belgian beers are known for, but it quickly mellows out and becomes soft and pillowy. The mild palate is certainly refreshing, and at only 5.8% ABV this is practically a ""Trappist Lite"" brew. If I had the means to buy this beer in bulk I would love to offer it up at summer picnics as I think it would pair well with lighter fare or just work as a great lawnmower beer.FINAL THOUGHTSWhile I wouldnt honestly consider Westvleteren Blond anything mind-blowing, it does impress (and slightly amaze) me that a beer this light and drinkable would be a Trappist brew.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQLZ9Rd8h6Q","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

955,"2010-09-15",4.4,"Bottle @ In De Vrede, Westvleteren. What a splendid place to enjoy a Westy, right next to the monastery! On the other hand, it is also the ONLY place to (legally) enjoy a Westy served in proper glassware in a pub, so... Regardless, I had been looking forward to this missing link among the Westy family, so expectations were high. Although I must confess I think the style (""blonde"") itself has its limitations, this is truly an exemplary specimen of the style. The glass comes with an inch-thick white foamy head, covering a perfect straw golden body. Nose is also extremely pleasant and well-balanced, with honey, tarty yeast, citric notes and hints of floral apricot. The first sip reveals why Westvleteren has been on top of the charts for so long: the blend of flavors, mostly analogue to the aromatic profile, is so smoothly blended that the only discernible flavor is a bitter, grassy hop aftertaste. Otherwise, this is a blended orgasm of the otherwise typical ""Belgian blonde"" tastes; truly a blissful composition of what the genre has to offer. Major thumbs up once again for the most elusive and exclusive brewery in the world. :-)","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

The flavor is bright and cheerful, yet earthy, with a combination of lemony citrus, a mild yeasty twang, and a  dry sweetness.

955,"2010-09-09",3.9,"Cap dated xx.09.05, so, this is a 6 year old bottle. Have had this one fresh before, but tasting an aged one should be interesting. Thanks for a great extra, Greg!

A: The pour is the typical hazy golden straw color with a fluffy white head.

S: The nose is very floral and sweet, very honey-like to be frank. A nice orange note to it as well. A bit of yeast and perhaps some light fruit and spice esters.

T: Honey is definitely the primary flavor here, which is a stark contrast to a fresh bottle. Great honey, orange, and floral sweetness that is quite refreshing, actually.

M: The body is light with a crisp carbonation to it. Quite light on the tongue like you would expect.

D: I think I might actually like this aged version better than the fresh ones that I have tried. A really big difference in terms of flavor, and a beer that you generally would not recommend cellaring for this long, but I think it worked very nicely.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

ight hazy, straw yellow with a fizzier looking frothy white head. Decent head retention. Very mild yeastiness, a bit of sour fruit aromas, and some hay-like aromas. Very mild touch of hop bitterness toward the end. Pretty representative of the style in that there is a wheaty yeastiness, very muted touch of hops, lightish malt presence. Didnt get the sour that was present in the nose. Actually, not overly complex but very nice and refreshing. Ligther/thinner body and a bit of carbonation that tends to be a bit snappier for the style, but still ok IMO.  Really drinkable and refreshing, but since it wasnt overly complex I wasnt coming back expecting my palate to be intrigued with every sip.

A - Just slightly clouded golden honey color with an average foamy, sudsy very white head with good retention that settles into a nice foamy layer of lacing that sticks to the glass.

S - Nice mix of some grassy and herbal aroma with a vibrant fruity esters aroma, featuring apple, lemon, a touch of orange and pear. Also has a nice spiced aroma in the background with some clove, coriander and a hint of pepperiness. Yeast aromas are also wafting in the background. Very enticing armoa just begging me to take a sip.

T - Didnt quite live up to the smell unfortunately. Good malty and bready taste serves as a base for a nice mix of fruits and grassy/herbal hops. Plenty of apple and pear along with lemon and a touch of orange like citrus. Mixed in with these and really coming out mid-sip is a good spiced flavor with spices similar to the nose. The hop flavors wax and wane throughout the sip, but never get too powerful and only provide a touch of bitterness. Sweet maltiness comes up a bit at the finish. Nice balanced flavors that are just a touch too light for me.

M - Somewhere between medium and light body with a large amount of carbonation. A bit of a spritzy kind of feel with a touch of drying on toward the end. Fairly creamy while drinking it though.

D - Exceptionally drinkable beer. Mouthfeel is very refreshing and easy to drink and the flavors are enjoyable and make me want to drink more (as does the aroma). Could easily drink this anytime and want another one. 

Notes: Best before 06/08/10. Enjoyable beer that was light and refreshing. The taste was a touch too thin/light for my liking, but I think some of that may have been due to the age, which wasnt the freshest but it wasnt too old either (I would really like to try one of these really fresh). Overall a solid beer and very good example of the style. Wonderful smelling and very easy to drink, and refreshing.

A- Body is a very cloudy, translucent golden yellow. Pours with a beautiful creamy 1/2 finger white head that has perfect retention. A white film is left all the way down the glass. When held up to the light one can see that the cloudiness is thick and dynamic with some dark yeast sediment lingering throughout as billowing bubbles rise from the center of the glass.

S- A soft fruity presence is the first thing detected in the nose. The fruitiness is mellow but offers hints of pear, white grape, and exotic fruit. This is accented by a peppery spice and soft floral hops.

T-The flavor upfront is very mild with peppery spice, bubblegum, pear, and exotic fruit all mixing together wonderfully and there is a slight earthy, musty background. A distinctive soft floral hop flavor comes through for the finish along with a mild bready yeast sweetness. The finish is pretty dry and all that lingers is a mild to moderate floral hop bitterness in the back of the palate.

P- Medium to high carbonation and wonderful light to medium weight, smooth, yeasty body.

O- This is a wonderful blonde ale that has a very soft character. Well put together and very drinkable. I would love to try this fresh and would definitely have it again. Now the search is on for Trappist Westvleteren 8. Too bad these are so expensive...

The taste is actually very full considering the style and level of ABV. Plenty of herbal and spicy notes of hops and yeast on top of a biscuity malts. Grass and some citric notes. Its rather sweet with some complementary bitterness. The finish is surprisingly bitter with a noticeable taste of sweet alcohol. Hints of phenols and white pepper.

Smells of wheat, with plenty of citrus and a bit of white pepper.  On tasting, the fizziness turns out not to be as aggressive as it looks, but is instead a lovely mouth-coating tingle - similar to Orval, but not quite as good.  Flavourwise, lemon dominates, with wheat and spice in the background.  Its remarkably easy to drink, and I found myself knocking it back in next-to-no time and wanting another.  Its strong for a session beer, but it certainly feels like something Id like to session!  So, potentially it could have been the worlds greatest session beer; however, for me a hint of sourness in the finish stopped it short of true geatness.","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","wheresthepath"

The lemon stays through the finish and adds a nice slight tartness that sits and rides in the throat along with a gorgeous yeasty that is so specific that it becomes a dominant feature rather than an accompaniment to the hops.

I didnt even have a slight chance of getting a clear pour.  The full bottle looked quite clear when held up to the light, but as soon as I popped the cap the yeast started to get mixed in to the beer, it even foamed up a bit.  The beer, as it sits in my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip, has a fat two-finger thick, light cream / off-white colored head.  The head is fairly dense and takes quite some time to subside, it forms a varied surface as it does and also leaves some fat lacing on the sides of my glass.  The beer is a muddy, murky, really down-right ugly, pale tan / amber color, that shows a deeply hazed (cant see through it), more orangish color when held up to the light.  The aroma is quite nice though, vibrant fermentation character, a touch of hops and a solid pale malt / grain character comes through quite nicely in the nose.  Aromatic notes of hay, lemon grass, Meyer lemon zest, a light green-herbal note, distinct star-fruit, a hint of ripe melon, pear, spicy clove, white pepper, a hint of ginger, whole wheat dough, sweet wheat, a touch of honey-like malt, soda crackers, .  The nose is quite vibrant and has me quite pleased to taste the beer.

The beer has a peppery note to it that is a combination of the suspended yeast, the carbonation and the fermentation character.  Soft and doughy feeling up front (can I actually feel the yeast or am I just imagining it), the beer picks up texture from the carbonation as it rolls across the tongue.  The beer finishes with a green hop bitterness and a bit of yeasty astringency.  As the beer warms a bit fruity notes of honeydew, a touch of pear and perhaps some apple start to become noticeable under the more dominant hop and spicy-fermentation notes. This beer is actually fairly hoppy (despite being two and a half years old) with lots of herbal notes, a substantial bitterness throughout the flavor profile and a touch of soft lemon zest citrus character.  Nice and light bodied, makes this quite easy to drink, in fact I wouldnt mind having a couple bottles of this over an afternoon / evening; it is not thin though as it has some texture and body to it.  The malt character, while more supporting, contributes nice bread-like notes, a touch of sweet whole grain, as well as a touch of toasty cracker-like flavors.

The aroma of this beer is quite fantastic, but it needs to really be warmed up for the flavor to start to open up (It started out at 50°F / 10°C so wasnt really cold even).  This is still quite hoppy, and I would really like to try a fresh bottle to really get the most of the hop character.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Perfect durable white foam with a dark tinge in the middle.  Hazy yellow color.  Aroma was spicy with the same boiling mash cereal smell that I found so appealing in the 12.

Pours hazy, pale yellow with a frothy white head that shows nice lacing.  Aroma is crisp, fruity, and a touch of malts.  Great beer, there’s a lot going on with the taste, it’s fruity with a hoppy touch and a lightly bitter aftertaste.  Wheat, fruit, and something sweet, maybe honey?  It manages to do everything without being overwhelming.  It’s easy to see why this beer gets the rating it does.","Birmingham, Alabama, USA","JustinFromAL"

Aroma is of mild sweet malts, a suggestion of spice, and a light yeast presence.  The taste is subdued, a smooth malt mix sits nicely on a yeasty twang.  Subtle but very enjoyable.","Florida, USA","JMFG"

Smell is earthy with lots of spices and a strong citrus hop presence, mainly lemons.  There is also a slightly sweet bready malt undertone to the aroma.

Sweet pear and cut grass with grains in the nose, followed by white grape and hay flavors. A slight nuance of wood as well.

Surprisingly a good amount of hops in this one. So to sum up this rating in two words: orange rind. Orange as its the predominate flavor, and rind because of the lighter, hoppier, more citrus-bite characteristic of this one.

The taste is light and refreshing starting with a quick hit of mild malty sweetness followed by a growing tart bitterness mixed with light yeasty spice.

955,"2008-03-15",4.4,"A big thanks goes out to leftmindedrighty for this opportunity to sample such a fine brew 
The classic Westvleteren bottle poured into my chalice produced a good fingers worth of white fluffy head that turns into a thick lace that last till the end. The body on it is a hazy (I swirled the yeast) apricot color with fine yeast particles floating through out 

The aromas of bananas, yeast, grass and hops come through wonderfully. There is also some spice to it cloves and pepper 

Flavors of yeast and pepper, along with its almost earthiness of the other spices hit me first. Then other flavors, sweetness of fruit and a dryness of some hops in the end. Yes complex is a good word for this beer.

Light and smooth mouthfeel with a light crispness due to the carbonation would sum this up

Now let me say it is very drinkable. And I love to have it again . Due to its rarity and price I dont think Ill be having many more though. If I lived in close to the monastery it would be a great session beer. So I guess Ill stick with my Orval the next time I need a fix

I wasnt  expecting much from this beer, since it was shipped for a long distance, probably encountering some heat along the way.  I imagined lighter beers dont like this.  I was pleasantly surprized.  Yellow color.  Maybe a hint cloudy.  Triple aroma, reminds me some of the new LA Carnevale.

Poured carefully into a trappist glass, it appears a clear light gold with a frothy white head that deposits delicate lace on the glass. The nose is bright and yeasty with fruity esters and a touch of candy sugar ending with a slightly spicy alcohol note (odd for a beer at this ABV). Light bodied with soft, tongue-tickling carbonation, it ends with a fairly dry finish. The flavor is dominated by the complex yeast strain that fronts the profile: lightly fruity, dry and spicy, its a bit like a light-bodied saison. A well made and tasty brew.

Medium velvety texture. 8, 3, 7, 4, 14 = 3.6

Apparently I tried this twice.  I think this bottle was many years old.  Pours to a blonde body with a very thin white head.  The aroma is sweetly caramelized and has that typical Westy yeast.

Lightly sweet, bready malt aromas waft from the glass softly, with touches of vanilla nougat, teething biscuit, clean bread yeast, and a wonderful kiss of herbal hops.  Nothing over the top, but all the dimensions are perfectly balanced.  Light bodied, mildly carbonated mouthfeel with a soft, supple texture.  This manages to maintain a soft velvety texture while keeping the body light.  The carbonation level helps at this, holding itself at a level where the head is held high, but the bubbles dont scrub abrasively on the palate.  Clean, bready malt flavors with a gentle biscuity yeast that contributes minimal esters and no detectable phenols to my palate.  Wonderfully hoppy, with a crisp floral flavor that is heavy on the flavor but light on the bitterness.  This is the perfect sessionable Belgian blond ale.

Herbal grassy hop as in an unfiltered helles. Lime-like citrussy dryness, wild yeast, manure, wheat and lingering biscuit. Silky to the point of stillness, but not quite. GRASS. How did I miss that before? Not as a hop metaphor, but a real tangible mouthful, with roots and little clods of soil still attached. Clean but filthy dirty. This beer has more barnyard, yeasty edge and hop spike to it than Orval these days, and bottle by bottle has become a favourite of mine. Spiky, zesty, agricultural  XX shandy.


(old rate- what was I on???)....Tasted this with heavy flu at In De Vrede, and was convinced it was bound for my top 5 it seemed so aromatically hoppy, and was the only one of the Holy Trinity I could really taste. On second impression, back home and with my tasting faculties 100% restored, it seems a whole lot more restrained and, well....ordinary. Pours pale hazy gold with a pillowy white head. Aromas lemony, citric and grassy and leaning into witbier territory. There are also some nutty/vegetable/wheaty notes wafting about, not completely unlike an really adjuncty lager. Just a sniff of something dry, biting and herbal that sets it apart. But blindfolded, I might have mistook it for an unspicy wit brewed with a high proportion of unmalted barley. Its that lemony. Flavour bites with English golden ale citrussy/grassy hops and background biscuity malts. Soap and citrus to the fore. Needs plumping up a bit as it leaves a bit of a watery impression on the palate. Dry, hoppily bitter, pleasantly lemony Trappist sessions. But it cant touch Orval.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

Id already had the 8 and the 12 and since it was hot out, the Blonde was the obvious choice. I dont know when it was bottled but Id guess it was less than a month old.

It has a pale straw colored cloudy body with a one inch white head initially that fell fairly quickly. It smells very yeasty and malty with some fruitiness that reminds me a bit of a hefe with some banana and maybe apple. The flavor is not at all what I would have expected, but it is indeed good. It was much hoppier than I would have expected with both hop bitterness and flavor. It had a bit of spiciness to it as well and then finished with a malty finish. I think I got some noble hop aroma in there but I could be wrong. It is fairly light bodied. It could have been the situation, but it seemed like the perfect summer drink.","Troy, New York, USA","drseamus"

Pours a very light golden with vague orange tones, like hazy grapefruit juice, not too much for a head but slowly a solid soapy film appeared and covered the beer, leaving tiny blobs of lacing.  The nose is flowery and delicate, with some lemongrass, some slight hay, rich yet light sweet malts, and some tempered fruity esters thrown in for good measure.  On the palate the beer seems to simply disappear, very smooth and drinkable, everything seems in near perfect harmony.  Very versatile, starting lemony and grassy before the light malts come in to balance a very mild yet observable leafy hop finish.

Light cloudy wheat-beer appearance. Very tight, creamy textured, white head. Perfumed floral aroma (alas we used the wrong type of glass that didnt flatter the aroma). Mellow floral light fruity taste - slightly appley, but not sweetly so. In fact, it fills in with a dry and sharp hoppy middle taste which stays for the finish which was long but quite subtle.

955,"2007-11-25",3.8,"Pours a cloudy, dull golden color with a thin white head that has good retention.  The aroma is muddled, though somewhat bitey with a spice note and alcohol.  The flavor is dominated by a woodiness that underlies exotic spices.  Its difficult to pinpoint exactly what they are.  Perhaps there are notes of white pepper, lemon, rosemary, and others.  There is also a bitterness from the hops that is reminiscent of a Saaz based German pilsener.  Very complex... theres a lot going on here.  The mouthfeel is also incredible.  While it borders on overcarbonated, there is a silkiness of the micro bubbles that surrounds your tongue and feels very luxurious.  While this beer is classified as a Belgian Ale, it is definitely a bender (though BAs are a pretty wide, vague category).  Overall Im not sure what I was expecting, but its just pretty good.","Bloomfield, New Jersey, USA","dogfishho"

955,"2007-08-10",3.8,"Bottle sampled with a friend who brought it back from Europe.  Overall, strongly reminded me of a saison.  Aroma was spicy with hints of herbs.  Beer poured a hazy deep straw color with a persistent, finely beaded while head.  Flavor was spicy with hints of light malt, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Both my friend and I compared it to Leffe in some ways, Saison Dupont in others.  Significant bittering hops  pushed the balance in the finish towards the hopping and I was surprised at how assertively hopped the beer was for bittering.  The mouthfeel was rich with a silkiness that was very pleasant, although the body of the beer was light due to the moderately high carbonation level.  Enjoyed the beer, would be nice everyday drinker if it were around, but Id probably opt for a Sasison Dupont rather than seeking this Blonde out.","Port Jefferson Station, New York, USA","Aeneas"

Pour is a hazy straw yellow with a fair amount of carbonation.  There is a nice full, white head.  Aroma is sour yeast and earthiness.  Taste is very smooth, with some nice wheaty-grassy-earthiness and and a tangy sweetness (not that it tastes like Tang, more that it has a tang that is sweet). There is pretty much none of the sourness from the original aroma.  The body is medium with a very clean citrus aftertaste.  There was more complexity in this than I was expecting.  This would be a great everyday beer if it was more available.  Is it worth dropping $    on www.   .com?  For me, it certainly was.  Is it worth dropping $    on www.   .com again?  Not sure.

The aroma is fruity, with hops, medicine-like bitter notes, hints of cellar, spices, yellow apples and some alcohol. Quite complex actually, but yet not one of the best. The same goes for the flavor, which is fruity and sweet, with bitterness, spices, yeast and a dash of alcohol. Medium body and a finish with spices and hops. Funny thinking about the fact that this is the least interesting beer from this brewery, yet so good. Rating: 7-4-7-3-14-3.5. (070103)Bottle. It pours a hazy, yellow-orange body with some floaties and a nice, white head. Grains, pale malt, fruityness and yeast it the aroma. A little spicy note too. Nice sweet and malty flavor with some alcohol notes and a pleasant bitterness. Some herbal notes too. Medium to full body. Bitter, malty and slightly spiced finish. Wondering if I over-rated the beer last time, I did a rerate and found out I didnt. It really is a good beer. Rating unaltered. (080509)","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

There is some lemon and a bit of tart acidity (though the two dont seem related) and a dry lightly bitter finish.    Moderate carbonation, light to medium bodied.

Aromas of freshly squeezed citrus and crushed walnuts with the shell. Very interesting indeed. Light nectar w/ ample residual effers. The texture is soft yet fiberous like a cotton ball. Flavors are totally dry w/ delicate nuances of a French Champagne nature. A nice acid componant w/ bright citrus rind and yeast. Weaved in the mix are complexities consisting of walnuts,  muscat, honeydew rind, and a pinch of spicey clove. The finish is bittered from the stone fruit spectrum.

955,"2006-11-08",4.2,"Straight out of a fridge at the Bishops Arms in Umeå.

appearence - might have had a touch of chill haze, but a yeasty pale straw yellow colour with a fine head that slowly disappeared, leaving fine lacing that stuck around.

Aroma - Complex, with herby, slightly peppary hints, lemon and honey.

Flavour - the drinking mans trappist - begins with some faint malt and a touch of herbs and phenols, which is all quickly and rather rudely pushed aside by a powerful hoppy finish, with a puckering bitterness that can be felt all the way back home (its a 30 minute walk from the pub). The lack of richness that you usually associate with Belgium beers only makes this example more noteworthy and more drinkable!

Palate - wonderful, tingley carbonation at the tip of the tongue, followed by a smooth middle and a powerful hop kick in the throat at the end. Who said you cant have it all?

Overall - one of the most suprising Trappists Ive drunk to date, not least because this is a beer that you could drink more than one bottle of without being wasteful. Of course youve got to find another bottle first, and when you do be prepared to spend $27.50 to buy it (this is, after all Sweden). But you get the general idea...","Umeå, SWEDEN","lagomswedish"

Poured a hazy gold, well conditioned as the carbonation was microscopic and slow to release. Head was firm, rocky and held out for the length lacing well. Aroma was fruity, citric - a blend reminiscent of New Zealand and American hop notes - with grapefruit, passionfruit, guava and just a little bready yeast and pale malt to fill it out. Its quite lively in the mouth. Its not harshly carbonated but it does bounce and prickle. Sweet, fruity esters lead it, its yeasty and bready otherwise. Nice ripe grapefruit and lemon, touch of sour malt in back before a dry, scarcely fruity bitter swallow that held little length. As it warms it fills out a little becoming tangy, gammy and slightly herbal. Not much to it, though it is refreshing cold. Glad I got to try it, though it was no showstopper.

Golden yellow and almost clear in the glass, visibly effervescent, with a creamy small bubbled head thats thick and clings to the side.  Duvelish smell, yeasty, with banana and light fluffy bread.  The smell also has a strong strain of herbs and spices (ginger, coriander).  Light and lilting on the tongue, some watermelon and malt ride the refreshing body.  Only after the swallow does this get serious, with noble hops at great strong level drying out the finish (and some black pepper too).  Thick wall of lace everywhere, with a bit of the 3D effect I saw in the J & J Blauw.  Soft carbonation dominates the mouthfeel, filling the mouth with soft foam that tickles the tongue and keeps the beer delicate before the nicely delicate and dry finish.  Racing is quick and belies the effervescent upward tension in the beer.  Although the flavor doesnt dominate the experience (which is usually my preference), this was obviously crafted with a look toward the feel and the softness; in that regard, it is incredibly well done.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Extremely pale straw golden blond, yet hazy, so the overall appearance is of a heady wheat beer with a big puffy white head.  Smells like a wheatfield with occassional peachtrees in a big loaf of religious challah bread.  Taste is tangy and more like a lemon rind than any other beer Ive had before.  As it finishes, it tastes like grass.  Its surprisingly exciting compared to its style and ""statistical"" evaluation next to its brothers.  It is clear that very personal care went into the making of this beer and it is certainly a beer to keep other blonde beers who have lost their soul awake at night.  This is no super sweet, coriander heavy beer, though both those subject will become evident upon some of your tastes of this beer, but other times it will taste rather different and always provide a pleasing complement to what you are contemlating or experiencing.

955,"2006-06-26",3.4,"For my first passage at the eminent abbey of St. Sixtus, I settled to stop by the controversial In de Vrede, and see what the fuss is about. Sitting myself at one of the large tables, I ordered the Blond and a side of cheese. To my right a lone smoker sat with his beer, while the two noisy families on my right were enjoying a meal with theirs. I must say these are rather poor conditions for such a ceremonial event, but I took my chance anyway. Poured and slipped under my nose in an instant, the beer was topped of a beautiful white foam that slowly diminished leaving a sticky lace evenly across the surface. Below, a rather sickly looking liquid gravitated in the glass, an ochre tint that seemed somehow unappealing, perhaps due to the sooty grey table it was sitting on. As I brought the chalice to my nose, the only smell I could sense came from the miasma crowding the room. With effort, I began to detect light estery notes, bubble gum and banana especially, followed by pepper, chalk and cream. A refreshing fragrance but somewhat bland, I must concede. The strong tingling of carbonation first collides with the tongue, but subsequently reveals a spicy flavor of pepper and coriander mixed with mango and wheat. Again, a lack of depth surprises me, as the finishing bitterness of Belgian hops strikes my palate. I consciously make an effort to perceive the subtleties, but cant, and end my glass in a quaff. This one deserves another chance.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Blonde dapparence nuageuse.  Belle mousse blanche crémeuse.  Nez de métal, de grain, de foin mouillé et danis étoilé.  Effervescence marquée faisant de sorte que jai limpression de manquer certaines subtilités des flaveurs.  Le grain dont la fermentation ne semble pas achevé (!) prend toute la place en bouche.  Manque franchement de houblon par rapport à mes expériences précédentes avec cette bière.  La finale est dune sécheresse prononcée.

I would guess that the 8 or 12 would benefit from some ageing, but this probably shouldnt be aged.

Moving on to the beer itself, it pours cloudy yellow, with a small, fluffy white head, sediment is fine. Light aroma, slight alcohol, slightly spicy. First taste is light bodied, yet it rich and complex. Despite its light refreshing character, it never feels watery. Subdued sweetness, slightly dry, spicy and ever so slightly vinous.

Best by date on the cap says 25.01.06. This ought to mean that its still all too young to be consumed. At least from where Im standing, I found it a bit too yeasty and it had this peppery, sulphury sharpness. All in all blaha-blaha...","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rickgordon"
955,"2004-05-25",3.1,"Hazy golden hue with initial fuffy head which fades and leaves a good lacing. The araoma has notes of barnyard and dusty yeast, herbal and aormatic hops, pear and crab apple, lightly toasted pale malts. The taste is balanced betweeen the malt and yeast with a grassy bitter and lemony twang added in. A hint of spice and wheat on the finish, The mouthfeel is lively and very dry, not much going on here however. A good beer as far as blond ales go... but rather boring in the end, not refreshing on the palate.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
955,"2004-05-12",4.1,"Pours a cloudy bright orange color that leaves a small off-white head.  Lacing is minimial.  Aroma is a light sweetness with some spicy yeast notes.  Flavor is ""fresh"" tasting, like springtime, whatever that means.  Very good bitter bite on the swallow.  Nice sweetness with a excellent yeast notes.  Body is medium and lively in the mouth.  I think a little more sour notes would improve this beer but it is still a work of brewing art.  I could drink this one very often.","California, USA","unclebleen"
955,"2004-05-09",3.4,"Body is clear yellow with a foamy head. Aroma is somewhat cheesy with tones of yeast and fruit. Quite sweet and full.

Not saying that Sully and Pogo were lashed on the night, quite the opposite, but whether we admit it or not, we were pushing the rating along quite a bit on the night. Golden Belgian style ale with a large fluffy white head, settling down to something more modest. Sour, dry aroma with some sweet malts deep down in the aroma.

955,"2004-04-26",3.0,"I think this is going to hurt. My first tilt at a Westy and it had to be this. Great presentation in the glass, albeit not a trappist one. The head appeared to be creamy and well formed. The nose presented with a bit of understatement, what I wanted it to say is unclear but it didn't yell ""I am Westy, I am great"". Instead it sat there with a degree of Belgian indifference. Come the taste test, bugger. This was thin and largely uninspiring.

As I don’t really like Blonde beers, finding them rather plain and boring, I wasn’t really looking forwards to this one – until I poured it.  Immediately the strong smack of lemony hops came out of the glass and I knew this wasn’t an ordinary blonde beer.  Lovely golden colour with a bewitching hop aroma.  Excellent bitter, very bitter, and hoppy flavour balanced by maltiness and a balanced yet bitter finish.  A classic blonde beer for others to strive for.

Acidic, pale-malty and grassy-dry-hoppy flavor reminds me of La Chouffe - only with less alcohol and more hops. Earthy and much smoother with yeast. Still grassy bitterness in the finish. Almost medium-bodied, smooth-carbonated palate. A nice and balanced blonde, although a bit too acidic.
(Bottled, was 8-4-7-4-15=3.8) Hazy yellow-golden color with a large, white and fluffy, lasting head. Very lemony, yeasty and dry aroma with lavender and flowery hops, but also some caramely malt. Very bitter-hoppy, lemony and quite acidic flavor. The yeast makes it quite a bit smoother, but with the acidity remaining. Medium-bodied, dry and acidic palate with a bit foamy carbonation. A very saison-like, dry and hoppy blonde. Cant quite compete with the best ones, like Saison Dupont, though.
(Bottled, at HBF 04, was 8-4-7-4-17=4.0) Murky, blonde color, small head. Yeasty, flowery citrus aroma. Very neutral and soft flavor, although carbonated and hoppy. A very enjoyable blonde, but must taste this one again in a more suitable environment.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"

This was the MOST entrancing aroma out there at the beer fest...and is definitely in my top 2 or 3 best aroma's out there if not the best. The aroma hinted at yeastiness, a barnyardiness, some lemon and honey, with a hint of tartness and a contrasting sugariness. It pours a cloudy yellow with a nice sized white creamy head. The taste is a sourly and yet heavenly thing. Definite peppery finish that made this sweet yeasty fruity gem just the most well balanced beer at the fest.

My experience of Orval was not favourable, but I had to try De Koninck a few times before I started to appreciate the subtle darjeeling flavours. This Westy is a gentle drink, quite soft, despite the late hop bite, full of pleasing citric flavours. There is
the distinctive Belgian yeast blanket that marks it out as something apart from a British Golden Summer Ale, though it has a lot in common with that style. A pleasing drink, and one to compare someday with Orval and De Koninck.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

Palate is lightly carbonated with a  soft body.  Aftertaste is mostly malty and spice, with a little sweetness. This beer was something of a surprise to me, I suppose it just didnt fit the mental picture I had formed of what Westy Blond would be like.

Head is initially large, frothy, white, fully lasting.
Body is hazy light yellow, bottle conditioned.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Despite the seemingly old bottle (4 or 5 years old?), this thing is still lovely and vibrant, very brightly herbal and lemony, with no baked apple or other typical pale beer oxidation smell. And its still quite soft and clean and wonderfully balanced. Hope someday to have this fresh in Belgium again (where its probably still 4+), but that will probably be many years from now...so a wildly expensive bottle in Stockholm will have to do.

The appearance was excellent: very uniform white head, nice hazy yellow beer, and streams of bubbles starting so incredibly tiny.  Aroma was surprisingly subdued: some citric and yeast notes.  So overwhelmingly easy-drinking...just pouring down my throat.  Excellent texture: bubbly yet smooth and rich.  Increasing depth of flavor as it warmed over half an hour, yet still rather tame.
