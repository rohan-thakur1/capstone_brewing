Perhaps, if Id looked closely at the label, the words ""Red Ale"" might have prompted me to expect something slightly different. Nonetheless , its a handsome gingery colour with a pleasant firm herbaceous hop aroma. However, in the flavour, a more malty character appears. Slightly smoky and ashy feel that didnt mesh perfectly with the hoppy character and the effect was slightly out of balance.

Quite mild and dangerously quaffable beer with a lovely fruityness. Rating: 7-4-7-3-14-3.5. (071006)Bottle. A copper/amber colored beer with a small, off-white to beige head. Rich malty nose with beefstock and sweetness. Pinecones and a fruity touch too. Sweet and malty flavor too, with caramel and beefstock. Piney and fruity too, getting more pronounced towards the end. Almost astringently bitter, slightly sticky, and full-bodied in the mouth. Lasting finish. Better than I remembered, but with a quite similar score. (080829)","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

3725,"2007-11-07",3.5,"Tap @ the Brewpub. Pours deep dark red with a big creamy slightly off white head - lots of lacing. Aroma is dominated by sweet caramel and citric hops. Little spicyness.  Quite vinious and rather hoppy bitter. Has a feeling of Christmas, but just in its malt composition. Rather dry making it a nice British Christmas beer.Earlier Rating: 8/5/2007 Total Score: 3.3Bottle. Bought at Kolding Vinhandel. Pours a muddy deep red-brown with a medium yellowish off-white creamy head. Aroma has a good deal of hops, citric and pine-like. A little caramel to back it up. A little thin mouthfeel at first, but it betters when the hops hit. A little sweet to begin with, and a good dryness and hoppyness at the back. Nice and fresh! 3.6","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"

The flavor is sweet malty with light spicy notes of cinnamon combined with stronger notes of caramel. The body is a bit thin - not much residual sugars left, which for me is a drawback.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
