3556,"2017-05-27",4.1,"Poured from its 1 pint can, this brew appears a hazy, clouded golden yellow, despite being described as ""pink"" on the can! The thick white froth which bubbles up immediately releases fruity citrus aromas, punctuated with the strong notes of passionfruit and guava. Forth recedes almost immediately, and does not revive upon swirling, but the aromas do. The taste is a mixture of sweet from the fruitiness, sour from the brew, and salt - the salt and sour flavours balance each other perfectly, making this a deliciously thirst quenching potion, without much tartness or mouth-puckering. Carbonation is soft and just-so, giving it a nice medium body and satisfying mouthfeel.","","the_beergery"

Light earth and funky passion fruit notes on the edges, as well, with mild to moderate lactic character and very biscuity, sparse, crackery malts behind it.Citrusy opening with lactic and fruit acids combining leads to a juicy fruit character that is rather quickly brushed away by the strong carbonation and salt that grows stronger towards the finish. Dry, though, but with somewhat of a thin finish on account of the very grainy, crackery malts.

Not much of a gose per se but the base lends itself well to showcase the fruit incredibly well. This juicy cloudy pink brew is delicious and refreshing throughout, like a tour of the tropics with some grapefruit like bitterness as well.
Less than a year later, the beer is now canned, but no longer the same color (cloudy golden, not pink) and has significantly less fruit in the nose and flavor.  Oddly enough its more of a gose now, but I feel bamboozled that theyre selling this as the same product and its so obviously not the same.  Oh well.  1 4-pack will be enough.

Have had two other Fruitlands variants - Sour Cherry and Apricot - and gave them both relatively low marks (3.69 and 3.68), but still really looking forward to this Passion Fruit and Guava one. First time that Ive seen a Modern Times bottle or can with a born on date. Finally.

Poured a golden-straw yellow, hazy color with 3-to-4 fingers of off-white rocky head, which fizzed out quickly. Lots of bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Bad watery lacing. Average retention. (Sight - 3.50)

Smelled salt, tropical tart, guava, passion fruit, pineapple, grass, hay, Cheerios cereal, hints of vomit and stone fruit. (Smell - 3.75)

First thought on the taste was some kind of white wine, maybe a Sauvignon Blanc. Then got salty sea, tropical tartness - guava, passion fruit, pineapple, light melon and stone fruit - grass, hay, cereal and hints of honey. (Taste - 4.00)

Light body. Oily texture. Lively-to-fizzy carbonation. Abrupt, dry, tropical finish. (Feel - 4.25)

This was my favorite Fruitlands yet, much better than the other two. Still a new style to me (just my sixth review), but this was on the high end for sure. (Overall - 4.00)

3556,"2016-06-10",4.2,"Various 22oz bottles and tap-pours since its introduction. Cloudy peach juice pour with lower acid-cut foam. Powerful, seedy passion fruit nose, juicy, fresh. Taste is simple and light-bodied, Passionfruit lemonade is the main flavor - refreshing, assertive. Pulpy and rich tropical fruit especially with the tap version. Very tolerable acid, balanced, outstanding really. Muted saltiness. Its as enjoyable as Wakefields Miami Madness. Amazing.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3556,"2016-03-21",3.6,"On tap at the Festival of Funk. It pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma has huge sweet guava and hints of sweet/sour passionfruit. Very fruit forward. A little green. The flavor again, is strong with guava and lesser notes of passionfruit. Some unripe/green notes. Good level of tartness. The fruit totally takes over the beer, but not necessarily in a bad way.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
