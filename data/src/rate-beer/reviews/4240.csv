4240,"2017-06-13",3.2,"On tap @ Fauners Tavern, NYC. This one has a slightly cloudy looking darker purple amber colored body. Low in the head department, only a small sidesticking pinkish red film. Smells really nice, sour and inviting. Lots of cherry stone, sour small cherries, strawberry and wild forest yogurt. A sourish tart berry infused really pleasant aroma. Tastes really nice also, but its not sour. At all. Feels nice and oily in the mouth and its just about average on the carbonation. Cherries, the sweeter kind, a little earthy strawberry water. Blueberries and grapes. Nice, lightdrinkable. 13.06.2017","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Who knew. Pours a clear dark brown, offering up a slight off-white head with modest lacing. Taste is sweet but restrained, tart cherry meshing with the vinous dark fruit notes of a Belgian dark ale. Grows a bit soda-ish in the middle, sugary and indulgent, yet the tartness staves off the beer becoming cloy. Finishes semisweet and sour with a strong cherry fade.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

So, I get my beer, and walk away a happy man, thinking I am about to sip a nice stout, but instead, I was greeted with a taste I can only describe as equivalent to a sour Warhead shoved up Rosie ODonnells ass and then crafted into a beer for some unsuspecting fellow just looking for a dark stout. Yep. This beer SUCKED. Now, to be fair, there are many who like ""sours"". Had I been told it was a sour (which I should have been), I never would have tried it.

A just below world class fruit beer shines from start to finish. It bears some resemblance to the soda like cherry lambics but somehow adds more. Id love to try it on draft at some point to see if it tastes brighter or more vibrant.

Aroma / Appearance - A deep fluid black base seeps downwards with one mission - to sweet the pint glass. Sweet cherries, malt, and fruit bloom. If not for a couple of slight variances this would be a dead ringer for New Glarus Apple Ale.

Flavor / Palate - Cherries dipped in bittersweet Hershey kisses warm the palate. The fruity body then marches to a strong focused finish of pure malt. A little more clarity would not hurt but this generally gets the job done. Id certainly spring for a few more if the fridge were empty.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

4240,"2016-02-16",4.2,"Bottle, bb 10/2020.
First impression, reminiscent of a Petrus oud bruin for the base beer.
Mahogany brown with an amber hue. Almost no head. 
Rich cherry pie filling, cherry sauce. french fries/grease trap, very mild tannins, strong brown type malt (brown paper bag).
Carbonic bite pricks the palate, lips to begin, before turning to a brief tartly sour taste which quickly turns to a chewy tootsie roll caramel/chocolate malt profile, sturdy. Finishes with a mild acidity with lingers in the throat. Complex, not too sweet or sour, very enjoyable, balanced cherry presence which is rare.","Bucktown, Ohio, USA","One2remeber"

4240,"2016-01-12",4.3,"Now that Duvel owns an international conglomerate of craft breweries, theyre starting to brew beers for multiple brands at multiple breweries. Boulevard has made Ommegang beers and now Liefmans has too. Though in this case Id say its not a bad thing at all. Ommegang Rosetta is quite similar to Liefmans Fruitese or Kriek, but not as overly sweet or sour as either of those beers, respectively. Big cherry flavor with plenty of authentic fruit flavor, sweetness and a nice tartness as well. This is a fun beer.

I pour an 11.2oz bottle into a tulip glass. It had a best before date of 10/2020 and cost $3.99 ($0.36 per ounce).

Appearance: Dark maroon/burgundy color with bright red highlights. Pours to a fairly large, off-white, soapy head which mostly dissipates but does leave some nice lacing.

Smell: Essentially cherry puree. Sweet and tart. Seems authentic, though.

Taste: Fruit beers are an interesting bunch: theyre sweet, tart and sometimes sour. One thing they dont tend to taste like is traditional beer and yet most beer purists are okay with that. Id include myself among that group, especially in the case of this beer. Theres plenty of authentic cherry flavor from beginning to end. Up front its like a sundae topping, through the middle theres just a touch of bitterness and it finishes with a short, sharp tart bite. The tartness lingers and theres perhaps a hint of sourness in there somewhere, but this is most definitely not a traditional lambic or any kind of lacto/brett wild ale. Of course, I could see barrel-aging it making it even better (if done correctly). The palette is pretty simplistic and repetitive, yet I enjoy it as much at the end as the beginning. Its a liquid dessert.

Drinkability: At 5.6% ABV, Ommegang Rosetta is actually quite efficient for its body. The mouthfeel is rather light and thin; not crisp like a lager but far from any kind of cloying, sticky sensation. In fact, Id criticize it for finishing too clean, in fact. Still, its a liquid dessert and quite tempting to throw back several of these in a row.

Aroma of malt and some bing cherry. Taste is malt that is immediately joined by tart fresh cherry. Medium carbonation joins in on the swallow, with all parts moving to a lingering finish that becomes more and more tart, semi-sweet cherry.

4240,"2015-10-11",3.8,"330ml bottle - $1.99 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Best Before: 07 2020.

Appearance: Pours a dark brown, ruby-tinted body with just at an inch of deflating, though sustained off-white foam.

Smell: Sweet-smelling, sugar-spiced cherries, moderately tart, with a dusting of baking spices.

Taste: Fairly sweet, though, thankfully, its not overly so, followed with a pop of tart, sweet cherry fruitiness. Subtle spicy quality with a little underlying woodsy, earthiness. Sweet-tart, fruity finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation.

Overall: I thought you all should know I found it better than Id anticipated, as it met my hopes of: not being too sweet (even if specifically sweetened) or syrupy, not being painfully artificial and being refreshingly carbonated.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
4240,"2015-10-10",3.7,"Small bottle in a taster. Pours ruby/brown with an off-white head. Aroma of cherries, some light tartness, some malty sweetness, and hints of spice.

4240,"2015-10-08",3.7,"This was poured into a stemmed pilsener glass. 
The appearance was a dark brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Lacing spider webs nicely.
The smell had a sweet to tart cherry over top of a nice maltiness. 
The taste was mainly sweet with a light tart cherry underneath. Light sweet to tart cherry leads into the aftertaste and slides into the finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the tartness make an effort to be the harshness but still just has an all around nicely balanced feel. 
Overall, I say this was a pretty good fruit beer for the cherry side of the house. Tartness is tame enough to win a good amount of fans for this one.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
4240,"2015-10-04",4.4,"bottle. muddy brown, barely some red highlights under a beige head. nice big cherry ball candy aroma with mild tartness and sweetness. flavor is the same. really similar to a beer i just had (delirium red) with a bit more attenuation. i thought that was good, but this is spectacular!","","SSSteve"
4240,"2015-10-02",3.9,"Unexpectedly exceeded expectations. Just grabbed randomly since I lime ommegang in general but this was quite nice. Deep brown with tinge of purple and fine head.

Lovely nose with slightly tart cherry, dark Belgian malt, a kiss of toast, funky Belgian esters and candu sugar. Smooth and fruity tart flavor with nice cherry flavors throughout, some Belgian candy sugar sweetness, and a bit of dark malt chewiness. Really nice and slightly tart and fruity and balanced and clean.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

4240,"2015-09-29",3.9,"330 ml. bottle poured to my sampler glass at the 2015 Lakeshore Beverage Trade Show in Chicago, showing a deep burgundy color, with a modest layer of off white head foam that quickly reduced to a persistent ring, and left clingy strands of lacing on the glass. The nose was expressive cherry, dark grape, with sweetness, and some vinous nature. Medium bodied, and nicely effervescent, the taste continued the esters, showed some lightly sticky texture, but was tart and thoroughly refreshing.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

4240,"2015-09-25",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2015 This beer was brewed at Liefmans in Belgium. It tastes almost exactly like the old Liefmans Kriek, which hasnt been produced in years. Cherry flavor is perfect; not cloying, artificial, or syrupy. Excellent balance of acidity and mouthfeel. Almost impossible to drink slowly. Awesome sour beer, and my new favorite cherry beer. And at $9.99 / 4pk, I consider this a great deal. The original Liefmans Kriek was $7 for a 375ml.","","Beeramemnon"
