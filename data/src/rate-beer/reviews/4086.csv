4086,"2015-04-03",4.0,"Bottle (375 ml). Shared by JulienHuxley, thanks!

Appearance: Hazy golden-orange with a medium easy to revive white head and some lacing.

Aroma: Quite minty with a nice funk presence, barnyard, mineral notes and light spiciness. Really enticing.

Taste: Moderately sour. Mineral notes, light funk, mild spiciness and a light minty presence.

Palate: Medium body. Good carbonation. Oaky mouthfeel. Mineral and minty finish. Quite dry. 

Overall: This feel a lot more like a gueuze than an unblended lambic, but the important is that it feels authentic and its really good. The aroma is particularly impressive with minty features similar to what can be found in aged 3 Fonteinen geuzes. Really good.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
