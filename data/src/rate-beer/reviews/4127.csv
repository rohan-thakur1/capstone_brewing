4127,"2016-12-24",4.2,"From bottle @ Schramms mead day 2016. Pour is translucent red, with notes of floral honey, slight vanilla, dry cranberry juice, jammy berries, and a bit of earth. Finish is boozy dry cranberry juice. Awesome.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Dfonorow"

4127,"2016-05-23",4.5,"Part of a mead flight at Schramms. The mead is a clear red. Still. The aroma has strong cranberry character in the aroma and the taste. A touch of fruity bitterness with a complementary acidity coming through. Leans more toward a sweet mead, but does have a little bit of dryness coming through on the back end. Delicious mead.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
4127,"2016-05-13",4.5,"Aroma is wonderful, cranberry juice, bitter, slight sweetness, slight booze. Appearance is red, clear. Taste is lovely cranberry, bitter, tart, skins, honey at the end. Mouthfeel is syrupy, straight up cranberry aftertaste. Overall, they never cease to amaze me.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
4127,"2016-05-13",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2016 On draft at Schramms. The pour is a deep ruby color, great depth with a bubbly collar of light pink head that lingers and lingers. There is a wispy film on top that I wish would just vanish. The aroma is excellent. There is a good tart cranberry right up front that mellows out with a nice smooth honey and a light booziness. There is just such balance in these. Its amazing. The flavor is incredible. Tart cranberry juice up front that mellows into a nice smooth, sweet fruit. There is no booze present at all, just sweet honey and a light tartness from the cranberry. The mouth feel is excellent as well. There is a thick smoothness to it and a heavy viscosity. It just coats the mouth and doesnt want to leave, nor do I want it to. The aftertaste is sweet cranberry and light honey.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
4127,"2015-12-07",4.3,"Pour out of bottle at the meadery, clear dark red pour with no head, still pour. Aroma brought notes of big cherry, cranberry, tart lemon into a bit of spice, lots of floral honey, vanilla notes. Taste was a mix of tart but slightly dry cranberry, cherry, red fruit, berry into some honey, vanilla, floral notes, some spice, cinnamon, finishing slightly sweet, slightly tart. Great.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
4127,"2015-11-21",4.5,"Pours cranberry red. Aroma is light Berry and earth. Flavor is wonderful. Honey melds perfectly with rich cranberry up front. Earthy before a nice blast of tartness in the finish. On fuller side of medium body. Ken nailed another one!","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
4127,"2015-08-28",4.4,"Sample at Schramms on 8/9/15. Clear red pour with a tiny bit of carbonation at first and minimal legs. Aroma of tart cranberry and dry white wine. Sweet honey and tangy cranberry flavor before a sweet and tart finish. Wasnt overly impressed with the nose, but this may be the best tasting mead Ive ever had.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
4127,"2015-08-19",4.4,"I love it. Not much of an aroma but the flavor is sweet cranberry juice. Amazingly there is actually a tartness on the back end which honestly blows my mind. How something this sweet and juicy can still have that nice cranberry tartness us mortals likely never know. Looks like straight up cranberry juice. Fantastic.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","FrankHammer"
4127,"2015-08-15",4.6,"Doesnt really smell like much. However, this is the only thing thats not great about this mead. Looks like cranberry juice. It is very sweet. Theres also an awesome tartness that is absent from most meads. As sweet as it is, it leaves your mouth fairly dry after the swallow. If chilled this would be amazing on a hot day.","Canton, Michigan, USA","lbnlaxer"
4127,"2015-08-15",4.7,"Nose is muted but whats there is very sweet and tart. Taste is amazing. Right up there with black Agnes. Perfect amount of sweet cranberry and dryness makes this really elite.","","linnymtu"
4127,"2015-08-15",4.7,"Sweet and tart, just like juice.... I could drink this with breakfast everyday, love this","Ypsilanti, Michigan, USA","jules1211"
4127,"2015-08-15",4.6,"Bright cranberry nose, amazing sweet first taste that yields to pure tartness on the finish, surprisingly thick body.","","CountPrattula"
4127,"2015-08-15",5.0,"Im about to find out if I can swear on RateBeer, because this mead is the SHIT. This is for sure a new favorite, the taste is incredible, mouth puckering feel... I could drink this all night...","Michigan, USA","jalford4"
4127,"2015-08-03",4.2,"Pours a nice bright red color with a few bubbles. Big cranberry nose. Its like Christmas. Tart flavor upfront that blends into a sweet honey. Really good.","Michigan, USA","SpongeRuiner"
4127,"2015-08-01",3.6,"Pour at schramm. Pink still color l. Aroma is slight funk and cranberry. Taste is very very sweet. Sugar and cranberry.","bloomfield, Michigan, USA","mikem409"
4127,"2015-08-01",3.9,"Pour to plastic taster at Schramms. Looks good; a still and transparent lighter cranberry. Smells solid; honey and cranberries. Tastes like it smells, but richer, with a smooth medium full-bodied mouthfeel thats tart on the back end. Good stuff.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
4127,"2015-06-02",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2015 Tap @ Schramms: Bright scarlet & red body, semi-clear with a few bubbles on top. Aroma of sweet cranberry sauce, honey, & a strong underlying floral presence in the back-end. Flavor starts off with a very modest tartness but quickly transitions into a super juicy cranberry sweetness. Huge backbone of toasted honey. Like Ocean Spray for adults. Finishes with that small bitter twinge cranberries have, cleaning up nicely & not lingering too long. Incredible stuff. As always.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
4127,"2015-05-24",4.3,"Pour at the schmeadery. Pours a still, clear dark rose. Aroma of cranberry essence and honey. Taste is sweet (!) cranberry and wildflower honey, with a dry, tart finish. Medium body. Incredibly solid.","New York, USA","tchaos"
