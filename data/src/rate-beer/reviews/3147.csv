3147,"2016-10-13",4.1,"From notes. Enjoyed this during the 2nd Annual Kellys Island Bottle Share on September 18. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a hazy bright orange gold color with a thick white head that slowly falls, leaving a couple spots of lace. The aroma is beautiful. There is a ton of nectarine right up front. There is a sourness behind it that seems a little lacto-forward to me. There is a good acidity to it that Ive come to know and love. The flavor is a little more fruit forward and controlled. Its really a thing of beauty. Tons of fruit flesh and a light pit presence. There is an earthiness to the flavor which balances the lacto funk beautifully. The mouth feel is a little syrupy and heavy with a great carbonation and a lingeringly tart nectarine flesh that lingers. This is awesome.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3147,"2016-09-05",4.0,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is very nectarine forward with light citrus and pineapple notes. Light oak notes with hints of white wine. Moderate acidity in the aroma. Nectarine has a nice juiciness to it. 
Pours a hazy, bright orange with a medium sized, thin white head that recedes quickly to the edges and disappears. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor is moderately acidic and slightly sharp with some light lemon and medium light pineapple notes. Moderately strong nectarine notes with light oak and white wine characteristics. 
Mouthfeel is medium.bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice Nectarine sour from de Garde. Good wine barrel character with nice storm fruit notes. Acidity is a touch sharp though.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Taste is medium tart with a pretty good pucker at the finish. Fairly dry, some sweet fruit flavor. Not super jammy but it has a pleasant full fruitiness. More wine barrel presence than in the aroma.
