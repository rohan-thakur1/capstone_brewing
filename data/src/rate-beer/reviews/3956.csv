3956,"2013-02-26",2.3,"Pours white wine yellow, clear with no sediment. Bright rice wine ""tropical"" nose with detectable light alcohol and very FAINT raspberry. Drinks with that unexpected yet expected light ""saltiness"" that sakés have, 2/10-sweetness (on the dry side), mainly rice wine & soft alcohol, with hints of pineapple, raspberries (definitely not LUSH), and the alcohol and dryness takes over in the finish. Low compexity, low-med depth, okay carry, okay drinkability, not too amazing as a sipper. It takes awhile getting used to the subtlety of the raspberry flavour; the bottle is so awesome-looking and the anticipation is high...but alas, disappointed. Perhaps ok as a mixer.","","sulawang"
3956,"2012-10-24",2.3,"Served in a small wine glass, at my local P. F. Changs. Turned out to be more than enough. Clear white color, with a yellow hue. Nose of rice and maybe a hint of raspberry. Little honey. Sweet taste, heat. Bigger body. Rice aftertaste, hint of raspberry. Not really the tastiest experience for me. I probably havent learned to appreciate this stuff yet.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
3956,"2011-06-29",2.7,"bottle thanks to mora2000.  poured a light yellow with decent legs.  raspberry, vanilla, light, and almonds.  easy palate, alcohol, vanilla, lack of raspberries, and hot.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"
3956,"2011-04-24",2.7,"(750ml bottle thanks to Mora2000) clear, tinge of pink with mild coating of the glass. Nose of subtle raspberry and rice. Taste of alcohol, rice, dry, subtle raspberry, and overall its a bit too alcoholic for my liking.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
3956,"2011-01-04",2.9,"Bottle courtesy mora2000. Very clear appearance with almost no color. No carbonation either. Aroma is fairly faint. Not much aroma on this. Maybe a hint of raspberry but not much. Flavor is fairly sweet with rice and alcoholic wet wipes. Fake sweet flavorings. Not much raspberry.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"
3956,"2011-01-03",3.0,"Clear. Aroma is heavy on the rice and a little bit of raspberry. The flavor has a good bit of rice and vanilla notes with a tad bit of raspberry flavor and sweetness. Not near as much raspberry character as in a lot of other infused sakes. Decent.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
3956,"2008-02-23",3.0,"Very nice and refreshing. Aroma is very sweet with only a hint of raspberry. Slightly off-white tinged body with some dripping down the side of the glass. Very smooth with just the right amount of berriness. Alcohol is not that well hidden at all.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
3956,"2008-02-03",3.2,"(Bottle)  Pours a lightly pale clear pinkish tinged body.  Aroma of coconut milk, raspberry, and vanilla.  Flavor of vanilla, tapioca, and raspberry.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
3956,"2007-09-27",3.1,"(750ml bottle) Purchased at the Penny Farthing for $26.80. Interesting blue bottle with a coconut milk and raspberry aroma. Berry flavour turns to a alcoholic heat which finishes with a smooth whiskey like palate. Average.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
3956,"2007-07-11",1.7,"Cold at P.F. Changs, The Woodlands, TX. Ah, dinner at one of my favorite Chinese restaraunts-- looking forward to feasting on the orange peel chicken and Dan Dan noodles-- when, before said feast, I perused the drink menu for a pre-dinner cocktail.  What is this?  A sake I havent had?  Fantastic!  The waiter brought the sake in a small, slender champagne glass; it looked like  a flute for midgets.  Anyway, the liquid staring me in the face was cake-white, sort of a cross between white and creamy beige.  The aroma was sour wine and featured a subtle berry note.  The first sip nearly took my breath away, and that isnt a good thing in this case.  Diluted melon and bastardized candy invaded my taste buds and almost demolished them.  A watery mouthfeel didnt help the situation, either.  Guess Im not much of an infused sake man.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
3956,"2007-06-11",2.2,"the raspberry flavor seems abit off. it gives a tart presence to an otherwise normal tasting sake. not the best.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
3956,"2007-06-08",2.4,"The aroma is a little fruity but not that much raspberry its mostly just sweet with some rice and alcohol. The appearance is mostly clear with a little yellow. The flavor is like the aroma. The plate is thin and a little oily. A nice tasting sake but hardly any raspberry.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
3956,"2007-02-18",2.9,"Ordered at a sushi restaurant.  Served chilled.  Light yellow color.  Not very aromatic, I was expecting more raspberry.  The flavor had more raspberry then the smell, but wasstill subtle.  Still got the signature, rice taste and a little sweetness towards the end.  It was tolerable, but only ordered it because I was eating sushi.  Ive had much better.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
3956,"2006-08-17",3.0,"Bottle chilled. Poured light clear color with minimal legs. Moderate coconut raspberry aroma. Light to medium body. Medium sweet flavor with a light sweet finish of short duration. Drinkable softer flavor.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3956,"2006-04-24",2.9,"my friend ordered a bottle of this the other night.  poured pale champagne color with a note of stickiness to the outer edges of the flute.  i suppose most sakes would do this due to the sweetness in them but usually i am drinkn out of a sake glass.  nose of sweet alcohol and dampness. funny no real nose of raspberry.  the overall flavor is raspberry dominated, with a sweet alcoholic ember background.  somewhat extract,  pushing out the sake flavors.","Henderson, Nevada, USA","bitter"
3956,"2004-12-09",3.1,"Had cold, from the bottle at PF Changs in. Pours a silky clear - looks like vodka - same sheen to it with just a hint of cloudiness. Aroma has some raspberry notes of course with a touch of peppermint. Flavor has some subtle raspberry notes with a warming alcohol and butter presence in the back end. Mouthfeel is thick and full - a good pre-dinner drink.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
3956,"2004-07-11",3.2,"Clear, less viscous on the edges of the glass. The aroma is light with coconut & light fruit. The flavor is lightly sweet with raspberry and a dry finish. Alcohol isnt very noticable, the raspberry notes are very light but apparent.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3956,"2004-07-03",3.2,"2004 bottle..aroma is quite delicate , raspberry  of course but its subdued and freesh..some rice  .
I didnt get the pink  of the other reviewer..just a light chardonnay.
while the flavour is sweetish the riuce still shows through and the raspberry is an attractive afterthought..
Nice and slightly creamy on the tongue
nice sake.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
3956,"2004-06-07",3.0,"2003 bottle @ California Rollin in Rochester NY.  Tried this a while ago (before sake was listed on the database).  Chilled.  Pours a glassy, lightly hazy pinkish-violet.  Aroma of light alcohol, lots of fresh black raspberries, and some sharper rice notes.  Flavor is surprisingly sweet, lightly syrupy and quite warming on the finish.  Though this uses fresh Oregon raspberries, it still tastes a bit artificial, or maybe just more one-sided, not sure, but it was a bit too much for me.  Would have liked to see more sake characteristics and less (more subtle) raspberry notes.  Mouthfeel is lightly grainy, but thick right away when it is very chilled.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
