Mostly in line with the aroma, but with a load of that amazing Belgian candy thing. More intricate flavors came about after the initial gulp: coffee, roasted nuts, raisins, licorice, and alcohol. Really subtle alcohol flavor for such a big beer. Took me awhile to crack this one because it is so rare and epic and whatnot, but I encourage you to ""drink em if you got em""!

2315,"2012-05-03",3.9,"2009 33cl bottle from Premier Gourmet. Dark brown with a one finger mocha head that at first settles to a thin layer and then forms a small ring against the outside of the glass. Sweet malts, belgian yeast, alcohol, figs. Moderate to high carbonation, average body, little prickly from the alcohol, definitely more sweet then anything else, lost of fermented fruit, becomes somewhat alcoholic on the finish, along with some malts, yeast, and fruit. Good but think this could do with a bit more time so that it can mellow and become a bit more balanced.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"

2315,"2012-03-03",3.7,"Draft at ACBF.  Pours dark brown with massive over sized head. Not the greatest pour for a 15cl taster glass... Smells sweet, toffee, not much spice like the other pannepots.  Taste is caramel, yeast, alcohol, wood, and very light dark fruit. Not much port barrel for being aged in one for 3 years. Well, actually there¬ís not much dark fruit and a lot of sweetness, so I guess it went a little too long.  Definitely not the best version, but damn good still.","Austin, Texas, USA","xpimptastikx"

2315,"2011-11-14",3.5,"Draft on tap at FFF XV Party (Munster, IN). Pours a roasty blackish brown pour with good frothy offwhite head, laces small. Aromas are crisp toffee and caramel and vanilla, touches of red fruit and oak. Initial is red fruit, cherries and raspberries, a touch of boozy cough syrup, vanilla, oak, toast, and sweet malts. Middle is a bit coughy syrupy, more red wine tannins, caramel and toffee, vanilla, touch of spice. A nice touch of booziness, vanilla. Red fruit. Finish is just a touch a tart, red fruit, a bit artificial, oak, and sweet malts. Ok, a bit cough syrupy but the oak and Port element are well received.
