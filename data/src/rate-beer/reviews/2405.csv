2405,"2014-05-16",4.8,"Sampled from a 10 year old bottle at Ians, labelled as Neige Eternelle. On a night of incredible beers, this was probably the best things I tasted (I also learnt that bottles can be kept for many years opened without risk of oxidization etc). I honestly cant begin to describe how amazing this smelt and tasted - I would have been happy with my nose in the snifter the entire night except for the fact it would have made it harder to drink. The balance of the tart and sweet late harvest apples were just mind blowing and it kept on delivering on every sip and every aspect. And yet Phil and Ian say there are a few that are better (although the 10 years probably helped a lot)...I may need to go out and spend some money on ice ciders.

Appearance: 
1-3 are all very clear.   1 and 2 are a clear watery amber with 2 ever so slighly darker than 1.  3 was a clear golden yellow.  no head.  4 poured a hazy murky  pond water orange brown.  
 

more important stuff
1)  similar to 2.  more earthy, less tart.   found myself drinking this one the most.  kept coming back to it.  needed to get seconds of this.  the earthiest of the 4.  score: 4.1
2)  deep sweet apple goodness.  more tart than than 1.  both are solid.  more complex than 1.  The tartness really gives a nice layer to this.  tight.   score: 4.5
3) Most subtle of the 4 and the least sweet.   Think white grapes and white wine apple.  score: 3.7  
4)  sweetest of the 4.  stands out as being a lot different than the other three.  a caramel candied apple sugar sweetness.  nice. caramel, sweet aple crisp. The most different of the 4.  a lot of candy and caramel notes that were more present than the others.  some syrup and honey notes as well.  good stuff.  can see this going well with an apple stroodle (msp) or other apple dessert.  score 4.1

2405,"2007-12-11",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2009 In short: Ice-Cider with a higher than average wet/ripe flavour.
How: I had the three Face Cachée de la Pomme classics (Neige, Neige Éternelle and Frimas) side by side at Montreals Flaveurs, Bières and Caprice Festival 2007.
The look: Golden-yellow body with no head.
In long: Attack is very similar to its famous Neige sister.  Smooth, sweet with a lot of red apples skin.  The main difference was mainly in the finish and comeback.  Somehow this one dwelled in the extra-ripe apples and fruit moist territory.  Not unpleasant at all but I slightly preferred the smoother more drinkable Neige.  Being in quebec I find the name Eternal Snow insolent, almost offensive.  Thats like calling a New Jersey drink Everlasting Smell.  Show some compassion please.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2405,"2007-12-02",4.5,"Particulate pseudo-bubbles in stasis, a floating light reflector in the  midst of deep golden, molten nectar. Gorgeous and calm. Invocation of the distinct and catastrophic pummeling from the non-oaked version is immediate, a storm of compressed apple and poignant sugars, escalated now by insightfulness and retrospect only wood could add. A twist of tanginess, accentuated by tannic acids. A bakery has never released such near-space-conquering and concentrated aromas. Buttery pie crust notes that skirt the sweetness are pinned together at the edges by hints of molasses. The climbing of sweet peaks never before scaled is unbelievable - this is the single sweetest nose encountered, ever, in the realm of fermented beverages; such potency and concentration! The flavor is decidely calmer and less throttling but still supremely rich and well-executed. Apple juice, and accesorizing and complimentary(typical accompaniments) pie crust, glazed, caramelized and brown sugars and earthy fruit skins are all enveloped by thin sheets of oak influence. A mild tartness yields to acidity that disperses flavors evenly and resembles the mildest of carbonation sensations. Sweetness is off the charts. Ripeness and residual punctuation is so hearty and grows so steadily, the quickly compounding finale that lingers on is indescribable. The finish is sweet, very lightly doughy and tart, tannin hints and appleskins lingering in the shadows and mostly eclipsed by pure apple sugars. The mouthfeel is full and sticky with soft spurts of airiness. The palate does dry signifigantly as alcohol and sugars assemble and build up with each successive and less challenging sip. Virtually no bite from tannins and near-zero warmth from alcohol is a pleasant surprise and allows the palate and sensory perception the pleasure of easy focus and exacting dissection. My love for ice cider, with this offering, becomes an unbreakable covenant, a fortress of impenetrable love and adoration.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

2405,"2006-09-26",4.3,"Thanks to Kevin for bringing this great looking brew! Clear copper body, looks like scotch. Aroma is apples and apple skins, some cinnamon... like mom making applesauce. Light alcohol on further inspection. Great aroma. Flavor is very sweet apples with excellent sour in the finish. It isnt incredibly complex, but its damn delicious. Very smooth and I love the sour bite in the finish. Great.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
2405,"2006-09-24",3.9,"Dark golden coder with a pleasant apple compote nose, complex, with cinnamon notes. In mouth, a tingling apple sweet cider, sweet, maple, with notes of berries. Warming alcohol accompanies the sweetness, smooth and pleasaing. Tasted at Rendez Vous des Saveurs de lOutaouais, Sept. 24, 2006.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
2405,"2006-08-15",4.1,"Pours a still, clear golden color. Excellent aroma and flavor of sweet, baked apples with vanilla and oak, the alcohol is not apparent. Good liquorous mouthfeel. Great stuff.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
2405,"2006-07-06",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2010 The heralded Neige ice cider living a prolonged sojourn in wood barrels: Could it have been a gimmick? Not really, the wood is throughout underwhelming, leaving the vibrant, intense apple moist flavours dominating the landscape here. Very full bodied, syrupy looks of a dark golden apparel. Apple sauce, pie-like and concentrated fruity flavours (pear, mango, peach) all join the late showing soft oak that brings a precious toastiness into play. Maple strong finish typifies the Face Cachées typical richness. An absolutely delicious elixir from this consecrated cider house.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2405,"2006-07-03",4.7,"Bu sur place. Couleur plus foncée est plus beau que Neige. Bon mélange darome de chène et de pommes. Goût plus sucré que laure , mais aussi bien.","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"
2405,"2006-06-11",4.7,"Tiny but potent sample from the bottle (375 ml, 2003 vintage) at the Mondial de la Bière in Montreal,  2006.  The viscous liquid is deep, bright gold, oily and almost translucent, with thick lasting legs that flow slowly down like tree sap....the nose is extremely powerful, erupting from the tiny sample in the midst of the Mondial chaos and making its presence known to the whole table, juicy-tart apple skins at first shading into a sweeter, cooked applesauce with cinnamon and a hint of raisin and vanilla....on the tongue though is where the true Rapture begins, the body is so decadently rich and creamy that Im simply at a loss to find adjectives or comparisons:  this may be the finest mouthfeel from any liquid Ive yet imbibed, cider-beer-otherwise.....the flavor is redolent of sweet apples, fresh and caramelized, vanilla, cinnamon and soft oak, with fine touches of licorice and sherry.....overall this is a darker, sweeter, heavier rendition than the other ice ciders from this producer and for me it all melds together into an unusurpassable richness; I know Im in the minority preferring this to Frimas, but there it is.  Right now the best cider in the world, one that I wouldnt mind choking on at my deathbed (apologies Josh).","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2405,"2006-06-04",4.0,"Sampled at Mondial 2006. Dark gold color. The aroma was incredibly rich with caramel and flowers. A very fresh smelling cider. Overpowering almost mouthpuckering sweetness. This had Jonathon Apples with a hint of honey. Sticky mouthfeel.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

2405,"2005-12-26",4.1,"Looks oily and slick, although perhaps a bit less than his big brother Neige, its golden robe seemed a tad darker as well, it looked like a fine cask strength scotch whiskey.
Definately more vanilla from the cask, but also some dark cherries.  The alcohol seems a bit more richer in the nose, that mingled in with a a citrus finale to give it a lemon sorbet feeling to it.
Surprisingly, the acidity wasnt as pronounced as I would have expected from a barrel-aged product, but what makes regular Neige stand out from most ice ciders is its perfect balance of alcohol, sweetness and acidity, and this version seems to have kept up very well.  It may be a little less velvetty smooth and may have a bit less body.  Alcohol not as present in the taste as it is in the nose, but still plays its part to calm down the massive apple cloyness to a tee.  

The oak maturation didnt really add much complexity to this offering, in fact it may have taken away a little.  It didnt denature it completely however.  It would be interesting to sample it along with Neige, but Ive had it enough to know that I like the original better.  If they want to continue this experiment, I would suggest they prolong the aging process.  Since this product isnt extremely potent in alcohol and very viscous, pehaps it would take longer to extract the woody flavors of the cask.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
2405,"2005-09-26",4.2,"Bottle: Poured a deep golden yellow color cider (probably deeper then the regular Neige). Oak is not clearly apparent but alcohol is more subtle then in the regular Neige which made me enjoy this even more. It seems every those guys touch is excellent.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
2405,"2005-09-05",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 17, 2006 A glinting monarch copper orange doesnt proffer too much oak in the aroma...We are nonetheless offered a balanced perfume of sweet apple, light lactic tartness and wooden dryness...Palate  is hugely thick and luxurious, as decadent as can be, apple pie liquefied and still steaming, topped by apple honey...The wood adds some complexity to the apple flavor, but dont expect to be overwhelmed by its characteristics...It finishes just quietly and tart enough to make you want to live this experience for a whole evening...Alcohols not a player in the flavor profile...This is just pure, unadulterated, apple glory...Licking your teeth has never been that much fun...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
