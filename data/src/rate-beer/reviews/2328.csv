2328,"2017-06-14",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2017 330 ml can from Mikkeller Beer Club, bb 06/12/17 ?
Amber-copper moderate hazy body, with a medium, fluffy, lacing, yellowish head. 
Lovely, very fresh aroma of elderflowers, white wine, grapes, citrus, flowers, fresh herbs, some wood. 
Tastes quite similar, with the wine barrel notes more dominant, more spices, quite some alcohol. 
Medium, a bit oily mouthfeel, with an average carbonation. 
Finishes spicy, a bit boozy, wooden, a bit bitter, vinous, floral, medium fruity, a bit hoppy. 

Tasty. The nose is wonderful, very fresh and diverse, releasing more and more aromas. The taste doesnt keep up though, feels a bit harsh, maybe too fresh. Overall still a very interesting, complex beer.

2328,"2017-06-01",4.6,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2017 Sharer. A real class act. Getting a lot of chardonnay, thyme, grass. Aging in white wine barrels was a master stroke I hope see emulated in the future. Complex and dry with medium head, relatively slowly dissipating. Somewhere beneath all that some classic Belgian malt flavorings make for some subtle sweet notes.

2328,"2016-09-03",2.8,"750ml bottle - thanks martjoobolut
Pleasantly sweet aroma . Harsh saisony taste. Plenty of nettley zingy hops in the aroma. Messy sweet malts, belgian yeast evident. Some booze going here too, winey vapours fill the mouth. One or two sips would have been fine, but finishing the whole 75cl was more than a struggle, it was actually impossible. That was a 20 minute walk home, and I didnt finish it. Heavy and sticky. Finish is liquoricey, bit of saisony grunge, and more alcohol heat. Ugh, rough one in that quantity.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

2328,"2016-08-10",3.9,"(On tap @ Mikkeller & Friends, Copenhagen, May 16 2016) Pours lightly hazed pale amber, with a fine white head that lasts and leaves lace. The aroma is very vinous and grape dominated with white grape flesh and skin, citrus peel, lemon juice, softly funky, fairly subtle. Flavour is also very white grape dominated with flesh and skin, pineapple, citrus pith, woody towards the finish with some musty cellar funk and vanilla. Finish is dry, oaky and grainy bitterness. Medium body, average carbonation and little to no alcohol heat. Feels more prominently white wine-driven than the normal version despite just being a different barrel. Thus it is quite nice but lacks the originals complexity.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"
