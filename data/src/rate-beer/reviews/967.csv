967,"2016-01-07",3.9,"Things didnt go well today, but they didnt go badly either. Just a weird juxtaposition of shine and shit. At least I can relish the fact that tomorrow is another day and hope that there is no confluence of todays events. What better way to fend that off than drinking this particular Confluence and removing the possibility for tomorrow? No better way as far as I know.
- The cage removed, a gentle press against the snug cork causes an uproar; a loud pop and a ferocious upsurge from inside the bottle. Naturally, my glass was handy and I was able to tip the bottle just soon enough to catch first the burst of foam and consequently the aromatic liquid streaming from the neck.
- The beer is a foggy shade of diluted honey, capped with a frothy lemon-white head that rises fast then recedes to a finger in depth, leaving a white, sticky sheet of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a mild balance of earthy, mild lemons, the delicate strains of dough, grass and a hint of geraniums almost effervescent above the Belgian yeasts. Theres a light malt foundation that acts as the beam for the balance of the flavors involving themselves on my tongue.
- A dry finish and a spicy tang buoys the flavor and aroma in such a way that my gustatory senses cry out for more, and as pricey as this was, I would definitely buy it again.

967,"2014-08-28",3.5,"750 mL bottle poured into a chalice. The aroma starts off with a bright and light champagne grape note backed by some hard cheese and barnyard aromas. The aroma then turns towards a sweet apricot, light banana, vanilla and mineral water blend. Near the end of the glass, a woody character starts to appear with a peaches and creme, candy lemon, a light pepper and a light clove note. Its a hazy / murky apricot yellow color with a silky thin, white head that leaves a light amount of small-bubble lace. A medium thin, silky smooth, white surface is retained throughout the drink. The taste is a medium sweet with a medium bitter and a subtle, light sour note. This beer has quite a bit of tiny, fizzy carbonation to accompany the oily thin texture. The medium body contains a complex array of grass, some apple, unripe peach, banana, lactose, vanilla, candy lemon, pepper and clove. A peach soda is what comes to mind most though. Its dry with a slightly burnt, with a pepper, clove, grass finish. Its refreshing and zesty with a lingering, astringent aftertaste thats spicy with some soda water tones to it.

No barrel tannins or heavy acids/fruit bi-products to knock this one down. Beer has a moderate haziness to it, though it is certainly not cloudy. Soft, amber body has a slight deeper bronze hue to it.Spicy brett in the nose is crisp, clear and moderately strong. No alcohol vapors/fusels and a strong malt backbone of thick honey and even a bit of doughy, sweet bread. Orange and tart lime brett notes burst forth but eventually yield to the house yeast character (banana-peach esters) with light vanilla notes and more malt on the finish.Tart up front, with a noticeable strong, chewy body that has ample maltiness. Not that its too sweet or anything, just certainly not as light and crisp as, say, Orval. A touch of caramel and plenty of honey, leading to plentiful esters and white pepper phenols on the end. Glacier hops, to me, are like the worst of both worlds (those being European and American hops) in that they have more acidity than European varieties, but the flavor waffles between ctirus and floral notes. Not that they are adding much bitterness here, being only used for dry-hopping, but I dont think the flavor belongs in a somewhat delicate Belgian ale. Why not just use the EKGs or tettnangs for dry-hopping?? No alcohol or flaws noted, very assertive carbonation.I like the idea here, and though I have not had one, I would imagine an aged bottle to be more dry and a little less full-bodied. As is, its not quite as refreshing as it could be. Too chewy/thick in texture, with the fresh Glacier hoppiness and phenolic dryness contrasting heavily with the lovely brett acids.

967,"2013-02-11",3.2,"2013.02.11 - Allagash Confluence - 750ml bottle in goblet glass.  2012 vintage.

Pours a very nice mostly clear golden color. Not much of a head, but a little ring and foam here and there, fed by visible bubbles at the center bottom.

Aroma is a bit sterile and medicinal to me.  Grassy.  It smelled kind of nice when pouring but the aroma seems less beckoning as it warms up.

Mouthfeel is pretty light.  Carbonation seems pretty low. 

Taste is OK.  It honestly seems to be changing with each drink.  There are some competing flavors here for sure.  Seems to be some lemon as mentioned by others, and that is hitting my palate like a medicinal taste, or is quickly followed by a bit of medicinal sterile taste.  It definitely seems like an interesting brew but I'm not enjoying it that much, to be honest.  As someone else said, it comes close but ultimately that taste on the back end turns me off.

Pours hazy golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers.  Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass.  Aromas of huge tart apple, lemon zest, orange, pear, strawberry, hay, grass, barnyard funk, earth, herbal, pepper, and yeast spiciness.  Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity.  Taste of lemon, pear, apple, orange zest, hay, grass, earth, herbal, pepper, funk, and light yeast spiciness.  Light earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruit, citrus, grass, hay, pepper, funk, earth, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit.  Great balance and complexity of flavors; zero cloying flavors on the finish.  Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a lightly creamy and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice.  Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish.  Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong pale with brett added!  Awesome flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth and crisp to sip on.  An incredibly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

S: Apples, pears, white wine, yeast.

T: I really like this beer. Its not incredibly sour (I like incredibly sour), but a wild ale doesnt need to assault your cheeks with a sour bomb to have merit.

967,"2012-03-13",2.9,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/11/2011.  Served on tap in a snifter at Bangers and Lace.

Confluence has a faded dark yellow color, further muted by a haziness in the center of the glass. A frothy white head is modest in size from the tap pour but lingers for the duration of the glass, leaving a few splotches of lace down the glass.

The malt base is crackery in the nose, with some white pepper and spice that helps the smell pop. Some lemon zest, white pepper, and musty funk. The aroma is wild, yet delicate and not very complex.

The flavor starts with a fair cracker malt base, with some white pepper and general spiciness. Throughout the rest of the sip, a mellow lemon zest tartness blends with a Bretty funk. Nothing about the flavor feels that full developed, though. A chalky mineral flavor seems to protrude here and 
there as well.

The body is on the light side, with a full, creamy carbonation that has a bit of a crisp bite to it as well. Overall, it has a relaxed feel.

The first problem is that this is built using the Saison style as a base, which is not my favorite beer. Even so, Oro de Calabaza and Fantôme Saison are much more enjoyable. This is just a mediocre attempt at a wild. Maybe more time would improve it, or maybe it is better in the bottle, but I was not impressed.

967,"2011-05-22",2.8,"8 ounce sample on tap at The Davis Beer Shoppe.  Not sure why this is listed as a Belgian Ale...should be in the Sour Ale category, given the use of Brett.  The aroma is lemony and tart with plenty of Brett aromas present.  Funky, yet reserved.  Fairly aromatic.  Muddy, murky, opaque vomit color with no head.  By far, one of the ugliest beers I have ever sampled.  Starts a little tart before this becomes very Brett-filled with flavor.  This kind of has an awkward astringency with olive juice notes.  Finishes a bit hoppy and bitter with some herbal notes.  The appearance really detracts from this beer.

4.0 A: Hazy dark yellow. One finger of white head with decent retention and a good ring of lacing.

4.5 S: Brett and fruitiness team up to form a bubblegum aroma. Very strong and very nice.

3.5 T: A bit too mild for me. Brett funk is there, but subdued. Hay and grassy. Indistinguishable light fruits.

3.5 M: Medium body. Good carbonation but could be a lot creamier.

3.5 D: Not bad, but sort of run of the mill. The price, however, makes this a beer to avoid.

A- Body is a nearly opaque golden yellow hue. Cloudiness is uniform. Pours with a massive, crazy 3 finger+ head-pretty much a gusher-but salvageable. Head fades to a nice foamy 1 finger or so and leaves a ton of lacing behind in the glass.

S- Nose is hoppy, funky, and very good overall. Lots of sour lemon, floral hops, spicy bready yeast, and some funk.

T- Flavor is very similar to the nose. There is a good balance between all these aspects described in the nose upfront. The floral hops intensify for the finish with some accompanying bitterness and some sour lemon lingers as well.

M- High carbonation with a light yet full body. Dry and spritzy with some yeast presence.

D- This is an awesome beer. Certainly wild and funky. A good member of the miscellaneous pale belgian category-but slightly wilder. Reminds me of a saison. Another wonderful allagash brew.

967,"2010-05-06",3.8,"City Beer Store, Allagash night.  I had high hopes for this beer, and while it wasnt quite up to them, it was also quite different than what I expected, altogether.  Its a mildly sour beer with an excellent pale grain flavor, oddly clean for the style.  Otherwise, theres a floral quality and a big earthiness from the Belgian yeast, almost lightly smoky in a dry mushroomy kind of way.  Mild, though definitely detectable, hops provide bits of herbaceous, minerals and grass in the finish.  The flavor is quite dry.  And the feel is mild, though good.  Quite drinkable for the abv and for a sour.  Im aging a bottle to see if the sour notes come out more with time.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

The conflicting yeasts produce some awesomely strange aromas. I got some fruits and funk and this wonderfully strange combination of both. The flavor I must say grows on you. Green apples and sour grapes lemon and citrus hops are just some of the complex flavors. I will also say that it is a solid medium feel in my mouth with great carbonation.

Brett is immediately apparent in the nose, imparting its signature earthy must to an underlying base of light caramel malt and straw.  Hints of lemon and dusty wildflowers, lend a perfumy overtone.  Flavors follow suit, striking a nice balance between light, grainy sweetness and soft wildflower hops, with hints of citrus rind spicing and a hefty dose of dusty, earthy brett.  The palate is medium bodied, sporting lively carbonation that intensifies on the semi-dry finish.  Overall, this one nods towards young Orval, and does so quite nicely.

Slight yeast aroma, but the thing I love about it (aroma) the most is the sour/tart brett aroma; nice aroma I must say. You get a slight sweet malt aroma with a nice sourish backing.Flavor is rather weak. There is that underlying tart/brett flavor, but then you also have that sweet malt and yeast flavor as well. The flavors arent popping out at me as I thought they would. The beer, for being as expensive as it is, didnt really live up to its potential, flavor wise.

Light tropical fruits lead off, but theres a lovely brett character that emerges quickly to frame the fruit flavors.

I waited again for 10 minutes as the side of the glass were left white, but i could finally reach the beer underneath.  The nose is inviting with straw, lemons, brett, must, and fruits.  The carbonation was now in the air and on my floor instead of my beer, so the mouthfeel was similar to something nitrod.   The flavors were softly bretty and hay-like with essence of lemon, but there was a spicy hotness behind everything that was very strange..i think it has something to do with the carbonation...i feel my heart filling with gas.

967,"2009-07-25",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 14, 2009 January 2009 Bottle Date; Sampled July 2009
A very careful pour yields a billowing, off-white colored head that starts out a glass filling four-fingers in height, plus adds an additional, almost two-fingers of structurally sound height above the rim of my 25cl tulip glass.  The head only slowly recedes, forming nice structural formations as it does so as well as leaving nice lacing patterns on the sides of my glass.  Nice aromas of ripe pear, floral melon and apple are noticed as I visually inspect this beer.  The beer is a hazy, pale amber color that shows an orange-gold hue when held up to the light.  A nice, slightly grassy, cracker-like grain aromatic quickly yields to a firm, but not dominating, funky Brettanomyces note that provides notes of light phenols, a musty blanket note, plus a touch of muskiness.  The fruit character is the most recognizable character in the nose though, with nice notes of Meyer Lemon, orange zest, and a touch of honeysuckle joining the afore-mentioned ripe fruit notes.  There is an earthy yeastiness to the aroma that melds nicely with the fresh grain notes. 

Nice and effervescent as it hits my tongue, the beer is a bit drier than the expressive, up front fruit aromatics might have suggested.  This is very light bodied, but still has a hint of body and viscousness to it especially in the finish where it manages to just stick to the palate. Slightly tart and tasting of ripe green apples, some floral melon qualities as well as some notes of ripe pear.  These notes morph into a orange-zest like citrus note towards the finish that tends to linger for a bit on the palate.  Musty Brettanomyces notes add a certain woody white pepper note, a touch of phenolic soaked cotton ball flavors, some spiciness that is similar to oak.  There is some more structure in the finish from a nice hop bitterness that is noticeable, but not domineering.  There is perhaps just a hint of malt sweetness to this beer, much of the time I think I am imagining it because of the floral fruit notes found here, but there does seem to be a touch of something that boosts the malt character just a hint.  Other malt notes of unsalted saltine crackers, a touch of grassiness and a nice crushed pale malt note.

This beer remains stubbornly effervescent until the end of the bottle; this works quite well with this quaffable-beyond-its-alcohol beer.  I like the balance in the flavor between the spicy fermentation notes, the fruit, the pale malt and the fresh hop character that this brew has. At times the zesty hop character really comes through quite well; this must have been quite a bit more hoppy when freshly released.  It is eminently quaffable with just enough Brettanomyces influence to keep my interest piqued throughout.  Definitely a wonderful effort and I like that the Allagash house Brett strain hasnt run rough-shod over the rest of the beer (though that can be nice at times too).  I wish I had a couple more bottles of this to age.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
967,"2009-07-24",3.8,"Tap at Barcade: Hazy golden pour with a dense white consistent head. Nice bright and bretty aroma- some mild Gouda rind, lemony citric notes, and that classic Brux horsey/leathery character. Crisp body. The flavor seems a bit young with some evident sugars and residual maltose. The middle displays some more rustic character I expected giving off some dry/sharp cheese rind, though its subtle. The brett will definitely pick up after some time. Im cellaring my bottle for at least two years. I look forward to this aged.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
967,"2009-07-21",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 18, 2012 My Bottom Line:
This diplomatic Wild Ale extends straw-like cereals onto delicate tropical fruit and flowers, leading to a peppery hop bitterness and dryness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the cloudy blond.
-The brettanomyces apport is restrained, yet perfectly levelled with the rest of the flavors. This is a very classy flavor profile.
-The big bubbles and the polite flavor intensity make this extremely drinkable.
-The spicy, coniferous hop bitterness is rather short. This would pair nicely with seafood, methinks.
-Light banana esters are found.

967,"2009-07-09",4.5,"""Confluence."" The only time I hear this word is when Monday Night Football is in Pittsburgh...Keith Jackson (back in the day) or who ever always waxes poetic along with the Blimp shot...""at the CON-FLU-ENCE of the Allegheny, O-HIII-O and the Mon-ANNNG-a-HEEE-LA rivers..."" Well, this Confluence looks like it should be 23 fazules of goodness, so lets see what happens. The Duvel tulip is the lucky winner today...its been warming for a good half hour prior to opening.

Wow...this is actually pretty light-colored. Lemon-honey straight up...with extremely active carbonation in the center of the glass and it rises like a tornado pretty quickly. Head is about 1/2 finger and for a sour it sticks around at about 1/2 strength pretty well. Not much lacing - just yeast wisps. Second pour provides a full finger of head and then some - some tight lacing in there too. Very solid.

Ooooh, pure austere funk. Horse blanket, dry dry dry citric acid sniff. I could detect a little fruitiness diffused from the glass earlier - not with my face buried in the tulip though. On the rim it has a sort of dry muscat feel to it, but on the deep dive its funkalicious. Big, perfumy, wild yeast. With warmth the grape must comes out a little more. If this was about 1/2 as funky Id think it was more of a funky saison. Thats what Im talkin about. Can ya dig it?

I am astounded by the dryness of this deal. The carbonation contributes to the cause. Its not a sour for sours sake...theres ultra-dry Pilsener-ish malt in here. Maybe even a little Styrian Goldings hoppiness in here...theres not a whole lot of roastiness - it is wicked light - maybe a little stewy malt thats lightly toasted? Am digging the primary Belgian yeast strain along with the Brett-ish funk. The yeast makes this deal and its extremely well-done. OK, maybe theres not an incredible complexity to it at first but the light grapes show up a little later - it works very well.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

967,"2009-07-02",4.0,"Bottle. Oh. Yes. You love it sweet, you love it crisp and refreshing, and Allagash is getting down to business for you. Ive been mistaking this beer for a Saison for a while. Stupid me. Comes out cloudy bright lemony yellow with a nice platinum blonde mousse on top. Big sweet green apple nose...almost floral in quality, but unmistakably a citrus scent. Makes you hungry and thirsty and happy all at once. Big fizzy sharp pleasant body, just grabs you right off. I could see this beer washing down pizzas at a football bash, easy, and it hides the 7.4 so well no one would make it through the second quarter. And thats the great thing about this beer--it can EASILY be a chugger, because this beautiful dry bitter resin/biscuit note comes bombing out of the mid-palate and leaves it with a super-crisp finish. So, after that very tantalizing sweet nose that you might worry could get you into cloying territory, it dries out, hits you with a nice complex swirl of flavors (nuts, tiny bit of banana, some other soft fruit notes, a bit of light brown toast), and then bang, theres one of the more refreshing finishes youll find at this abv.

967,"2009-06-03",3.9,"11 ounce goblet - $8.75 at Taco Mac in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Lightly hazed, dull, darkened yellow body with a thin, white head.

Smell: Sweetish, funky, tart nose of thin hints of malts alongside wafting phenolic aromas, discarded fruit husks, leafy herbs, sour lemons, earthy hops, and some funky, stale sweat Brett notes. As it warms, some curious touches of white pepper and even mustard powder emerge.

Taste: Delicate maltiness with some slight pilsner qualities and a few carefully administered drops of simple syrup. Then, all at once, its strongly phenolic, but its softened by some fruity tastes of ripe peaches, muscadine jelly, and melon. The flavor is punctuated by sporadic pops of tartness. Subtle Brett funkiness. Seemingly spicy, earthy hops provide a modest amount of hop bitterness. Eventually, a taste of sour lemon juice cut with still mineral water enters the picture. Light acidity. A hint of peppery alcohol and fresh florals and then its off to the dry, phenolic, vaguely fruity finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Fairly soft-textured mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Reasonably complex and more than interesting enough to hold my attention throughout the full eleven ounces served to me. Each sip presents something a little bit different and duly requires a second sip, a third sip, etc. Recommended if youre a fan of the sour ales and arent turned off by the price tag.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

967,"2009-05-29",3.1,"Gold with a small white head. Funky Brett nose with a dash of Belgian funk, too. Flavor is lightly fruity with a dash of citrus on top of sweet malt. Light and easy to drink. Not bad.","Cullman, Alabama, USA","RichJ7"
967,"2009-05-27",4.1,"750ml bottle pours a sparkling golden with a huge pillowy head.  Aroma is huge on the brett, with tropical fruits like mango.  Really bretty in the mouth.  I immediately harken back to the ""Des Deux Bruers"" beer which was an Allagash collaberation.  This is much better and more refined, and it doesnt reek of cat piss.  A very attractive offering though Im kind of turned off by the price.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
967,"2009-05-25",3.4,"Bottle Pours hazy and yellow with a mid-sized, creamy, white head. Great retention. The aroma is citric, fruity and sour with lots of funk, lemon and a hint of sharp cheese.

967,"2009-05-24",3.7,"Overall I was not let down by this beer.  From the downplay its received due to its little brother Gargamel, I expected much less.  However, I found it to be a very pleasant beer.  Sugary sweetness in the aroma.  Looks like a fine ass import lager (long live the tiger).  Tastes of slight brettishness with a very refreshing finish of fruity hops and blueberries.  I gotta stick up for this one rather than hate it in Gargamels shadow.","Seattle, Washington, USA","DicksMcGee"

Aroma is very bretty, horsey stinky, cheese, spicy yeasty phenolics, some cracker malt, light citrus tartness- and reminded me a bit of the harsh horsey funk you get from Flemish primitive.  Flavor is a bit thin and watered down especially as it warms- lots of funk, hay, earth, brett all around, cheeesy and tons of horseblanket and som wierd farmy goaty butyric acid going on.  Finish is a bit thin, dry and lightly acidic.  This was ok, but I think Allagash can do better with their funk beers.

967,"2009-03-12",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2011 In short: A fanstatic wild/bretty and refreshing Belgian blonde ale.
How: Bottle 750ml, many times, from very fresh to 2 years of age
The look: Almost Clear blonde body topped by a large off-white head
In long: The nose is nicely bretty with pineapples a lemons.  Doughy and fluffy body with flavours of pineapples, bananas, mangos and such.  A lot of coriander sensation although I think the beer is not spiced.  Some leafy hops that provide a juicy flower petals flavor without much bitterness.  Light lemony tartness.  Funk level is medium to medium-high.  Wheat sensation, like I was drinking a funky witbier.  The body is full and beer is nourishing yet it remains very refreshing.  Currently classified in ratebeer Sour/Wild category but please not that there is no sourness to be found here, this beer is wild but not sour.  Again, if I had to describe its taste in a few words Id say it tastes like a full bodied bretty Witbier.  Some sour beer lovers might be disappointed by this beer because it is classified in the same category as the sour ales but I was disappointed.  I once rented Shaving Ryans Privates that was wrongly classified in the war movies section.  I thought it was great and with a lot of action.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
