2204,"2017-02-28",3.6,"2016 Edition 6% ABV : Deep hazy dark amber color with low activity. Faint creamy beige 2 finger head, lasting around 5 minutes, with average lace and weak legs. Flavors of caramel, ginger, nutmeg, pumpkins, plums, noble grains, molasses, herbal spices. Bready toffee gingerbread feel. Lots of sweetness, yet well balanced by the bold sharp spices. Slick oily medium body with prickly and soft crispy carbonation. Medium strength finish, slightly sour, lingering herbal and leafy dry hops, dense dark malts, with red ale kinda spices. Lacks freshness, a bit dull and flat. Perfect dose of spices, and its quite filling. Although with the last pour of yeast it was too intense. Tasty flavors, but feels overly alcoholic at 6%. Overall very good quality craft, with a bit of tweaking this one could be excellent. Representing well the style, though probably a step too rough.","Quebec, CANADA","Bierdimpfe"
2204,"2016-11-05",3.4,"750ml bottle. Fantastic, moderately cloudy, reddish amber colour with small to average, frothy, half-way lasting, moderately lacing, off-white to beige head. Mellow, caramel malty aroma, fruity hints of mandarine and orange. Taste is moderately sweet caramel malty, hints of rock sugar, a touch of almond, marzipan, fruity hints of mandarine and orange, red berries, some rather plain hop bitterness.","Bielefeld, GERMANY","Idiosynkrasie"

Nothing fancy but super tasty and refreshing. Hazy brown orange with a thin, crisp head. Notes of caramel, burnt toffee, toasted malts and cereal smack the sniffer. Very tiny hop smell and flavour, a smooth and dry finish to boot. Should be drinking this from a boot actually. Germans sure make Lagers not suck. Even though this is Quebecois. But yknow.

2204,"2014-09-27",3.3,"Pours a clear medium coppery amber with one fingers of loose beige head diminishing rapidly to a thin skim, no lacing. Nose is caramel malt, honey, herbal and floral hops. Taste is caramel and bready malt, with a little spice and a slight nuttiness. Light to medium body, somewhat slick, sustained prickly carbonation, and a mildly bitter (20 IBU) finish.

Decently drinkable but for it being quite sweet and malty - its almost a honey brown. (I dont think I could handle more than one of these.) Not bad, certainly, and very appropriate for cooler weather - but I have to admit Im continuing to consistently rank lagers toward the lower end of my personal preference. In this case, I think Id be happier with a little more robustness and spice, and a little less caramel malt.","CANADA","UXO"

Arômes bien maltée de pain grillé, grain rôti, caramel et sucre dorge. Présence au nez également dun houblon floral et poivré, et dun petit quelque chose rappelant les petits fruits rouges, ou peut-être davantage les bonbons aux fruits et la réglisse rouge. Beau nez bien agréable, belle complexité, mais intensité plutôt moyenne cependant. En bouche, pétillement plutôt élevé sur la langue, onctuosité intéressante au palais, belle rondeur. Au goût, dabord très maltée en bouche, à la fois dans les céréales (grains rôtis, pain grillé) et dans les sucres (caramel, sucre dorge), et on retrouve cette subtile saveur de bonbon aux fruits rouge, de réglisse rouge. Cette entrée maltée est savamment équilibrée par un houblon floral et légèrement poivré qui mène à une finale à lamertume bien sentie malgré un IBU annoncé à seulement 20. Très bonne bière, goûteuse, savoureuse et bien intense en bouche, belle complexité. Excellent pour un festival!

Malt forward profile in terms of flavour, slight nuttiness and caramel toastiness.  subtle hop bitterness in the finish, which is moderately dry.  Well carbonated which curtails the finish a little and makes me want more sooner :-)  Overall very well crafted beer, unlike many of the Oktoberfest beers I am used to (although I have learned that the real Oktoberfest beer served in Munich during the festival is not the dark and very malty versions that seem to be common in North America).

2204,"2009-04-22",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2010 Clear russet. Lasting off-white foam. As is often the case with Trois Mousquetaires, were dealing with a perfectly clean offering and one that is tasty also. Its maltiness immediately takes a toasty orientation, nuanced by almond, bread crust and sesame seeds nuances while soft leafy hops procure minute bitterness. Very clean and agile malt profile, but somehow not as full-flavoured as previous vintages. The carbonation is a bit less vivacious, making the ensemble a bit less lively, apparently less dry. Still, amongst Quebec lagers, this is a sure value, just not quite the paramount refreshment/taste compromise it might have been in the last 2 years.  In 2010, this dropped down to an all-time low 4.1%. The slightly hazy amber pour wears a fine white head. Despite its lightness, its toasty aromas are not subtle at all, complementing the leafiness from the hops nicely and feeling a tad more mineral than your average lager. Earthy notions render the ensemble more complex, nuancing the breadiness with rooty, flowery touches. Easy to drink and light-bodied, it nevertheless proposes a rather crisp texture that makes it engaging. Previous score was 3.4, bumping up to 3.5.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Big chew on bready toasty amber Munich malts up front but this is quickly joined by a massive infusion of German noble varieties making this a German noble hop bomb with a rigid Munich amber malt spine.

The flavor is special, I ususally find biscuity malt in Oktoberfests, but in this one theres no biscuity flavors, it tends more to toasty, with fruits, earthy hops and again that spicy feeling, theres also bitterness in the end.

2204,"2008-09-26",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Minutious earthy hop waves brush a fruity toasted malt cove, as their spicy spindrift relentlessly poeticizes this distinguished unfiltered Märzen.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sturdy inch of foam stays atop the cloudy cherry red.
-The fruitiness is redolent of dried berries and raisins, as it delves into near-caramel sweetness.
-The malt character has a lot of personality, and as such may not emulate the usual Märzen, but who cares? This is beautifully drinkable and expertly crafted.
-The malts could be a tad crisper for my tastes.
-The peaceful big bubbles complement the comfortable body, increasing drinkability.
-A slight mineral character is perceived early on, but it is harder to perceive after a few gulps.
-That finish is really compelling!
