Sweet, somewhat nutty malt. Caramel. Mild pepper hoppy bite on the finish. Somewhat chewy. Easy drinking. Strong carb. Solid.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
1882,"2015-05-17",3.4,"Super light gold brew that doesnt have much character on the nose other than grains and some straw but a clean bacon-y smoke come in the flavor. Almost rauch beer esk... Strange but tasty!","","Roonai"
1882,"2015-05-17",3.3,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear gold with a white head that dissipates quickly to the edges. Aroma has a lot of earthy grains and a bit of caramel as well as a bit of dirt. Flavor has sweet grain with a touch of caramel and a surprising bit of smoke.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"

1882,"2011-05-14",3.3,"Growler.  Clear light amber colored pour, plenty of continuous carbonation and a thick lasting head with an aroma of sweet malt & honey.  Flavor is bready malt, more sweet honey, slightly vegetal and finished with a little noticeable alcohol.  Enjoyable Maibock.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
1882,"2010-05-02",2.9,"Pours orange/amber with white head, aroma is fruit, biscuit, and some caramel.  Slight hoppy start biscuity middle and a slightly dry malty finish.  Not too bad, really tasty and still drinkable.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
1882,"2009-05-11",3.7,"Growler from tytoanderso, thanks Ty!  Poured a clear, deep golden color with an inch and a half rocky, beige head that receded to a thick layer and left some spotty lacing.  Aroma of moderately sweet malts with hints of honey, some soft biscuit, a bit of grain, and some grassy hops.  Smooth, lightly sweet entry leads into a pleasant honey sweetness, a bit of biscuit, and some light fruit (soft apple, light orange) that leads into a soft grassy hoppiness that finishes lightly dry.  Moderate carbonation and nice, crisp mouth feel.  Overall, a simple, crisp, clean, drinkable lager.  One of the earlier reviews claims this is 7.1%, but there is no sign of it.  Thanks again Ty for sending me my first growler and a good beer to boot.","Aurora, Colorado, USA","BlackForestCO"
1882,"2008-04-26",3.9,"@ Arborfest, 2008 on draft

First beer of the night.  Strong malt aromas.  Clear amber appearance.  Malty, floral, bright on the tongue.","USA","cykyc"
1882,"2007-05-24",3.5,"Honey nose.  Some apple and vinous qualities as well.  Malt heavy brew.  A pretty decent representative of this style.  Nice effort.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
1882,"2007-05-24",3.0,"Faint bitter nose with a copper color.  Sweet caramel flavor with slight hints of apple.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
1882,"2007-02-16",3.7,"Copper brown color with a good 1.5"" of loosely packed head. Carbonation dies down quickly, though, and makes one wonder if the beer is under-carbonated. The first sip reveals that it is not under-carbonated. Not a whole lot of lacing unfortunately. Smells faintly of hops and malt, but nothing overwhelming.  Lots of bold malt which is perfect. Suggesting a doppelbock more than a bock. There is a bold spicy bitter hops that seems a bit out of place to me. It would be most welcome in a pale ale, but I want a maibock to be smoother. Tastes really good, just not what I expected from the style. The maltiness is right on. No, scratch that, the maltiness is exemplary. But the hops is just a bit overdone. I would not call this brew smooth.

I get a sparkly prickly bite from the combination of hops and carbonation. Just a bit too much for me for this type of beer.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"
1882,"2006-05-24",3.0,"If nothing else, the release party was a lot of fun. Complete with bagpipes and an actual preist. All pours were sub=par from a pitcher. Still, it was a dark golden, almost reddish amber colour. Decent sized head, considering. Taste was fairly sweet, certianly a bock with lots of malt flavours. There were some grassy hops in there, maybe even a bit on the floral end.  I thought this may initally be a bit thin, but later decided it wasnt. This was one of the more drinkable bocks Ive had, but not good enough for me to crave.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"
1882,"2005-09-27",3.7,"Nice Amber Coloring with Offwhite Head.  Sweet Malt and Floral Hits on the Aroma. Sweet Malt and Grains..bit Grassy...Crisp Mouthfeel.. Nice Spice and Hop Hit on the End.  Balanced and Characterable Maibock.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
1882,"2005-05-19",4.0,"Fresh growler purchased at the 2005 release party: One of the darkest Maibocks Ive seen. Very dark ruby copper color with only slight gold tones at the edges. That aside, it looks great, bright, clear set body and a huge foamy head of foam growing up quickly to generously cap the top. Cap sits for a good while before settling down to a hefty murk and the lacing coats in sheeting.

Aroma is clean and sweet with a good load of tangy candy-like malts bordering lager-like and heavy. Slight husk grain and herbal hops sit in the background.

Taste is bold and solid with a beefy maltedness thats thick, slick, and semi-chewy with some light fruity qualities, more so eluding to some caramel, but heavier set within a Munich malt breadiness thats glazed over with some butter. Sits on the tongue remotely like thin syrup. Finish really comes on nicely as the malts fade off. Sticky leftover fruits and bread gets brushed aside by a lovely build up of herbal hops spiced just right. The finish is almost smokey in a sense in the way that it emerges from the malts. Pretty cool character to have for a Maibock. I really like that part of it alot. Very nice hop finish on this one.

Feel is oh my thickly good. Almost too thick, if you can believe that. Big full malt body, smooth, clean, slick, and some chewyness all make for a nice sipping experience with this. I kept wanting to slam this stuff, but its a bit difficult. Registering in at 7.1% Its just too big for that. Very filling. Very satisfying though. Good stuff!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
1882,"2005-05-17",3.4,"Dark orange/amber color with a medium head, diminishing over a few minutes.  Musty aroma of malts.  The taste is a bit on the sweet side, but not to the syrupy level.  Pretty rich, but ultimately a one dimensional malt beer.  Still tasty though.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
1882,"2005-05-08",4.0,"Lovely aroma. Smells a little like Town Halls Single Malt. Outstanding appearance. Tastes a lot like the Single Malt. Sweet malt. Excellent mouthfeel. Good balance and great warming qualities. A very good brew.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
1882,"2004-05-16",3.0,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2007 Red.  Aroma of wood.  Flavors of malt; sweet, and roasted.  Simple and one dimensional.  An ok beer.----a little sweeter in 2007.  Dark brown, some caramel in the aroma and medium sweet malt in the flavor.  Score raised.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1882,"2004-04-13",4.3,"Appearance: clear amber color, great, solid, creamy white head.
Aroma: soft, sweet, honeyish.
On first sip: big sweetness ensues, honey, touches of citrus and other fruits, great, lusciously sweet, lingering finish.
Flavor resides anew in every sip and swallow, each time lip meets glass a resonation of honey sweet and luscious malt occurs.
Big malt, little to no hops, but terrifically true to style, in fact, an utterly exemplary example!
Sweetness never gets too cloying, though it shines very brightly and awards the senses with each subsequent consumption.
Continually ringing sweetness, a touch buttery, but every bit perfect.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
