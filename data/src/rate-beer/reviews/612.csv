612,"2016-10-25",4.0,"(On tap @ Mikkeller and Friends, Copenhagen, Oct 21 2016) Pours black with a fine beige head and light lace. Aroma lead by fresh brewed coffee with caramel and milk chocolate backing it, along with dusty cocoa powder and roast notes and hints of spice. Flavour has a semi-sweet milk chocolate and dark caramel core but lots of coffee for balance, cinnamon, vanilla and dusty dry roast. Lactose sweetness is rather subtle. Finish is dry with a light to moderate bitterness from coffee and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is medium weight and creamy from the lactose, with low carbonation. Coffee stout more than milk stout, the later giving feel without the milky flavour that can sometimes bother me. Very nice, and very flavourful for the ABV.","LinkÃ¶ping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

612,"2016-08-18",4.1,"750ml bottle from trade with Jason drank in Ferme-Neuve in a cabin in the woods, well more like facing the lake and being bitten by mosquitoes. Thanks mosquitoes for ""bitting"" on my parade. Aroma: great coffee, oatmeal, light to moderate roastiness, milk chocolate. App: great look. black with medium brown head, great lacing. Taste and palate: medium to full body, creamy, velvety, oaty (why not?), medium sweetness, really subtle roasted bitter finish. Overall: not usually a big fan of milk stouts as I often (always) good then too watery or just not tasty enough. This one proves me wrong. Taken, this beer is higher in abv than your usual milk stout but it drinks really nicely. Every sip feels like it pets my palate since itÂ’s so velvety. My first beer from them and certainly not my last one. Have others in the beer cellar and will sure trade for more. Great job Angry Chair...

612,"2016-07-29",4.0,"750ml bottle compliments of fishingnet. Thanks as always, Ben. Pours a deeper blackish hue, dark and richer opaque depth. A touch of brownish glow on the edges, frothy brownish head is firm and lively. A good retention and lacing overall. Aromas are rich coffee and caramel, vanilla, cocoa nibs and coffee. Rich depth of flavors and feel. Some caramel, more espresso and vanilla is rich, creamy, and inviting. Initial is firmer bodied but not heavy, creamy elements meet roast.

612,"2016-06-22",3.7,"750 ml bottle to snifter (thanks burg326). Looks good; a very slightly translucent very dark (almost dull black) cola with fizzy, foamy dark beige head.

612,"2016-06-10",3.8,"From notes. Enjoyed this one at the Brew Crew Bash in Ann Arbor on May 21. This one was poured from a 750 mL bottle. The pour is a lighter black color with a thin darker brown colored cap of head that vanishes quickly, falling to just a thin ring. There is no lace at all behind this. The aroma is definitely very heavy on the coffee. There is a nice roasty malt and a strong chocolate addition. The vanilla is a little light, but it is detectable. The coffee is definitely the first thing noticed, and there is a bit of lactose sweetness on the back end. The flavor is a little more controlled by the sweetness. There is a nice coffee and cocoa blend with a hint of vanilla, but itÂ’s really sweet, and there is a decently strong alcohol on the back end. The mouth feel is medium bodied, a little thin, and the carbonation, although mostly soft, is a little bright for a stout. The aftertaste is all coffee and chocolate, with the vanilla seemingly vanishing in the taste. ItÂ’s a good stout, but the premise was there for it to be excellent.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
