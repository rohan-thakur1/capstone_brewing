3550,"2015-06-07",4.4,"Hazy but bright yellow gold color, some faint smoke and citrus with a great lemon/limey citrus sourness. Pretty damn tasty and refreshing. Excellent!","Chandler, Arizona, USA","JPDurden24"
3550,"2015-05-17",3.9,"Slight smoky note in the nose. Ultra pale faded parchment yellow. Minor head. A tangy lemon juice citrus note that faded to cereal grainy note. Very light body. Quenching. There is a very subdued pine resin quality to the aroma and flavor, slight but perceivable. Excellent!","new york, New York, USA","bob_w"
3550,"2015-05-15",4.1,"My favorite beer of the evening. Draft from the brewery. Cloudy pale yellow pour. Slightly roasty aroma but mostly a slight limey sourness. Taste is sour with a taste of roasty smoke. Loving the style, my first one. Much more tart than the gose but not overpowering in the least. Still light tart b","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Art"
3550,"2015-05-14",4.0,"On draft at the brewery, enjoyed outside on a nice May Arizona evening. Im not that familiar with the style, but found it truly interesting. Its very smoky, sour/tart, and thick or heavy on the palate; the flavor lasts. I dont know what flavor the pine cones impart; I assume some of the smokiness. For someone unaccustomed to the style it was a bit much, and not everyone in our group knew what to make of it, but it certainly was memorable. A well-put-together beer.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","DMLINAZ"
3550,"2015-05-03",4.2,"Poured up on tap at the brewpub where it exhibits a glowing gold opaque body that supports a bright white head of foam. The aroma offers up lemon, grains, earthy gravel, grapefruit, and spicy herbal grassiness and above all of that is a thin cloud of slightly bacony soft smokiness. 
The taste is bold and quickly ramps up into near puckering bitterness and tartness thats lemon and grapefruit like. Behind those notes lurks some grainy malts and earthy sort of smokiness amid all of the tart bitter refreshing notes. Interesting juxtaposition. Yet another light and refreshing and hugely sessionable hot weather brew.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
3550,"2015-04-27",3.6,"growler, ddoes it taste like pine cones? what does a pine cone taste like? I cant answer any of these questions. It does, however, taste like a pretty solid grzter. Lightly tart and smokey, and refreshing.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3550,"2015-04-26",3.7,"Draft at the brewpub. Slightly sour nose of heavy citrus (lemon/lime), light vanilla wafer, a grassy note, faint pine resin and a touch of phenols. Cloudy banana yellow in color. Wow, a unique spicy/tangy flavor blend greets the tongue with sour lemon and a decent amount of lactic acid, a spicy rye-Iike note, a hint of banana esters and a faint whisper of smoky wood to finish. The smoke component, while detectable in traces, is fairly hidden for a Gratzer. Different but still quite enjoyable.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
3550,"2015-04-25",4.4,"Lightly hazed gold. White head. What a cool beer! Smoke, sour, light salinity. The amount of smoke is perfect. Awesome lemon/lime sourness. Man this is great!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
3550,"2015-04-24",4.3,"Smell is kind of like the ocean mixed with some lemon. Taste is lemon sourness, salt, and a nice bready finish. Medium body, smooth, medium sharp carbonation, and no foam.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
3550,"2015-04-22",4.5,"Draft at brewpub. Unclear dark yellow gold with a fluffy creamy white head. Awesome light moderate smokey pine. Citrus. Medium sourness. Crisp with a nice little zing. Totally unique and awesome. Interesting in every way. Just Rad.","Arizona, USA","beerbaaron"
3550,"2015-04-18",3.2,"Draft. Completely clouded wheat hue with a fluffy white head. Aroma is an odd blend of smoke, wheat, grass and pork. Smoke permeates the flavor, adding sharp undertones to notes of wheat, lemon juice and crackers. Carbonation is very high; body is medium-light. Exactly what Id expect from the style -- smoke and tartness -- but both wear on me after a few sips.","","PartyFowle"
