Fresh and very hoppy nose, quite citrusy, earthy and slightly spicy. At the same time fruity, but with some big notes of pine needles and resin/wood. Solid level of bitterness upfront, not that hoppy forward as the aroma indicated, but perfectly balanced with a nice malty backbone. Tiny astringency just during the first few sips. Herbal, bitter and fruity aftertaste. Average carbonation, light to medium body, creamy texture. Very impressed, for such a low ABV, the flavour is certainly big!
