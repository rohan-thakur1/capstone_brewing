1700,"2017-05-29",4.0,"Super hazy golden coloured body with a nice, two to three centimetre tall pure white head. Aroma of pure wheat, coriander seed, lemons, curacao, bread, yeast and some good bubble gum notes - very nice and truly refreshing smelling. Light-bodied; Great bubble gum yeast qualities at first with a big dose of malt and wheat, some coriander seed freshness and touches of fruits like lemons and oranges and a big dose of flowers near the finish. Aftertaste shows some sweetness, a lot of complexities from the yeast and a very refreshing lemon and orange zest flavour coupled with mellow wheat and a touch of grass near the very end. Overall, a great example of the style and a very refreshing beer for the season or really at any time of the year - even at Christmas time and it below zero! Great to sample and well worth trying if you can find it and making it a regular beer for the summertime, especially. I sampled this sixteen ounce, pint can purchased from New Beer Distributors in New York, New York on 03-December-2016 for US$3,00 sampled at home in Pungoteague/Onancock, Virginia (Eastern Shore) on 28-May-2017.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
1700,"2017-04-29",3.7,"Pours a bright, hazy golden with a medium white head that quickly fades. The aroma is what is expected in this style. Happily, its done well here. Wheat, banana, spice, lemon, yeast. The taste is slightly tart and slightly sweet. It essentially parallels the nose. Heavy in wheat and spice, still plenty of banana, some bread, lemon, and lesser orange. Some floral elements are found as well. Aftertaste is a mild and lingering duo of banana and lemon. Lighter in body, smooth in texture, and softer in carbonation. This one goes down really well. Id find it hard for someone not to like this.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"

Aromas of earthy and almost a bit husky phenol. Typical 4VG, bready and wheat like malt. Very dry aroma. Some isoamyl acetate. Really an underripe banana/plantain nose. Almost some ceylon cinnamon. Grassy. Quite dry for a hefe, big bready malt, lots of bubblegum, mild isoamyl, mild 4vg. Very dry, missing some of the body of fresher classical examples. Quite drinkable though. Balance is slightly towards phenol with a good deal of malt. Nice. Lively carbonation, medium body, light acidity.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

Doesn?t quite hit the mark for a german hefeweizen.  I am a little surprised at how highly rated this is by style. Re-rate: Sampled at Urban Chestnut during RBSG. Pours a hazy golden color with white head. Clove, yeasty, banana aromas. Refreshing clove, yeasty, wheat flavors. Better than last time, but still not an amazing German-style wheat.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","jcnielsen"
1700,"2013-01-18",2.5,"Bottle.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy light to medium yellow.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain), lightly yeasty (basement), with a note of lemon zest/pith, light notes of gum, popcorn, and pepper.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.

Another weird one, considering how much of a banana-bomb the Winged Nut is...theres almost none here, vaguely gum-like maybe, very little pepper or clove either.  And the voluminous head of most German wheats is absent as well.  Its almost more of an American-style wheat than anything else, as the prominent aromatic elements are lemon rind and toasty-wheaty malt.  Regardless of that argument, overall theres just not much aromatic intensity or depth, and its somewhat light, watery, and bland in the mouth as well.  A little popcorny too, which is always a turn-off for me.  Dunno what to say, its pretty blah and not really to style IMHO.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1700,"2013-01-10",3.7,"bottle. cloudy golden wheat with a large-growing fine white head and lasting retention.  gummy banana / tropical esters in the nose with a minerallic, slightly-sulfuric, very Bavarian yeast character.  low but round and full carbonation releases peppery phenols and acids across the tongue.  very close to Bavarian, though sweeter than I like, but theres a lot of hefeweizen in Germany that matches the level found here.  solid product by a talented brewer.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

1700,"2013-01-02",4.2,"Draft at Urban Chestnut. Pours a milky/cloudy gold with a stiff white head. The nose is as good as any hefeweizen Ive had. Banana & vanilla, light citrus notes and cloves.

1700,"2013-01-01",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 11, 2013 Bottle @ home, courtesy of jcnielsen. Im not going to lie- Im excited as fuck to try this, but am a bit nervous based on the amount of homerism that occurs in STL. Here goes... Pours a cloudy yellow-orange appearance with a white head. Fairly spicy, huge phenolic, banana, clove, vanilla, a bit overly yeasty, lemon nose. Very spicy, chewy yeasty, clove/nutmeg, a touch tart citrusy flavor. Hmmm, not necessarily off, but the yeasty elements seem to be overdone. Not bad but not worthy of the 99th percentile in my opinion.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"

1700,"2012-09-03",3.8,"So I am currently at Busch Stadium watching my beloved Mets lose to my fiancés Cardinals. I am surrounded by a sea of red and everyone is too Midwest nice to give me shit for being a Mets fan, it makes things even worse. The bright side is that Urban Chstnut has their beer on tap here. Cost is $7.50 for a 16oz plastic cup. Pretty sweet deal if you compare it to 7 bucks for a Blue Moon.  The beer pours with a nice thick head atop a thick golden body. Aroma is hefe banana with some grainy yeast knees. Flavor follows suit with very drinkable subdued banana esters ad sweet banana cream like graininess. By far the best beer I have ever purhased at a major league park.  I dont get this part, why is Terry Collins pinch hitting for the starter in the top of the fifth?  He has only given up 4 runs.

It is quite yeasty and shows a bit of creaminess.  Medium / full body thats quite smooth and feels richer than the taste.  The flavor starts off with cloves, nutmeg and spicy flavors giving it a dryer than normal taste for a hefe.  There is a bit of cream and hints of bubblegum, but it doesnt have much sweetness.

1700,"2011-01-27",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2011 Draft served in a big, tall weiss glass at the brewpub on opening day. Pours a very cloudy pale yellow color with darker shades in the center and a finger-thick creamy white head. Aroma of bready malts, banana, clove, vanilla, cream, and wheat. Hits all the right notes with a strong underlying creaminess and breadiness. The flavor follows along these lines, but the wheat, clove, and banana play a larger role than in the nose; the cream and bready and pale malts round it out with a decent amount of yeast in the finish. There seems to be a hint of vanilla in the flavor, too. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a bready, wheaty mouthfeel. This one is right on the money in terms of what a hefeweizen could and should be and I found myself liking the beer mid-way through more than I did in the initial sips.
