1333,"2008-12-07",3.6,"20080613  Draft at Capones.  Usually I am totally unimpressed by these Scottish style beers as they can have too much sweetness and too little bittering hops.  This was not the case.  Very nice beer is a pale brown with smallish beige head.  Aromas and flavors are nutty, sweet, and round with complimentary fruitiness and some nougat.  Dry, lightly smoky finish.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
1333,"2008-06-24",3.3,"On draft @ Capones with the Mad_indian. Pours deep coppr wth a small off-white head. Aroma of caramel malts, slight roast and smoke, and mild toast. The flavor is caramel, toasted malts, smoke, and slight roast.  Medium body and mouthfeel.","Levittown, Pennsylvania, USA","stegosaurus"
1333,"2008-06-23",3.6,"Tap at Capones the day after his SH promo night.  Pours a medium amber, clear with some soft and sporatic lacing.  Aroma is nutty at first, then a sweet caramel malt base, light fruity esters, some plasticy phenols, and light roast character.  GOod doughy toasted malt flavor, light caramel, and toffee, lgiht roast.  Mouthfeel is overall pretty smooth, but has a nutty grittyness left on the middle of the tongue.  Good for an 80-90 shilling scottish ale.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
1333,"2008-06-17",3.2,"On tap at Capones sampled with Stegosaurus . Amber pour with a bread, vanilla and malt aroma. A mild hop and bread taste. It was ok nothing mind blowing.","Levittown, Pennsylvania, USA","MadIndian"
1333,"2008-06-17",2.9,"Draft at Capones. No Sir I didnt care for it. Aroma seemed weak with only slight hints of perhaps caramel and a wee touch of breadiness. Flavor picks up where the aroma lets off with you smacking your lips to try and pick up flavors that just arent showing up. Next please.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
1333,"2008-06-13",3.6,"On tap. Poured a deep orangish color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of light earthniess, caramel, nuts, and I was getting some bread in there too. Tastes of caramel, toffee, nuts, and the same breadiness. Sweet finish. Light lacing left on the glass.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
1333,"2008-06-12",3.6,"[Draft @ Capones] Poured a clear brown color with a small, tan head that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of caramel, light roast, some smoke, toffee, and honey. Taste of more caramel, roast, some smoke, vanilla, and a bit of cocoa in the finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
1333,"2008-06-12",3.6,"On tap at Capones.  Pours a mostly translucent deep copper/amber almost brown with a medium creamy bubbly/off white head that laced.  Aroma of caramel, nuts, molasses, light smoke, and light toffee.  Flavor of a lot of the same.  Nice, smooth easy drinking Scottish ale.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
1333,"2008-06-02",3.2,"Draft at Blind Tiger.  Pours an amber orange brown beer.  Aroma is sweet malt and that dominated throughout the flavor of the beer.  Some etoh and a sticky mouth coating.  Didnt care for it.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
1333,"2008-06-01",3.4,"On tap at Maxs on Broadway.  Clear rustic red look.  Clean malt aroma; graham crackers, scattered vinous notes, earthy red tea, toffee; bittersweetness of caramel and dry nuts.  Flavor is soft and somewhat sticky in sweetness with honey, strawberry jam, and toasty biscuit malt; mild tartness that recalls something dark and pungent like rhubarb; eventually rather non descript crispy cereals and faceless spices seem most dominant.  Medium, effervescent body; lightly syrupy when swallowing; a vagrant, persistent, foul mulch characteristic hangs around in a long, somewhat sharp finish of honey, pecan skins, maple syrup.  A simple sweet offering that could be great in the right circumstance, though this isnt the right one; a rainy day in a lonesome edinburgh pub while waiting for sunday roast would do perfectly, but the warmth and the noise and the intensity of the environment here just make it seem very ordinary and unappreciable.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
1333,"2008-05-31",3.3,"Tap at the Blind Tiger.  Hazy brown-amber beer with a thin tan head.  Aroma is quite malty and nutty with a softly sweet breadiness.  Toasty and a little bit doughy.  Quite sweet and toffeeish.  Its a nice reasonably quaffable beer for a rainy spring day.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1333,"2008-05-31",3.6,"Tap at Blind Tiger. Rusty brown pour, tiny head. Overall has a good bit of peaty malt, light smoke, with a chewy carbonation. Mild and balanced malts take the stage. Nails the style. I really like the peatiness to this.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
1333,"2008-05-31",3.4,"Draft @ Maxs, shared by Stine.  Thanks, Eben!  Pours a medium cola-brown color; thin off-white head with patchy lacing.  Basic sweet malts, brown sugar (nothing sharp), and caramel in the aroma; not watery, but resigned overall.  Medium mouthfeel: chewy caramel and dried fruits upfront; mineral and light citrus bitterness balancing things out; good presence in the mouth, if a touch light.  Medium finish: nuttiness, brown sugar, and bread; basic, drinkable interpretation.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
1333,"2008-05-29",3.5,"Tap @ Blind Tiger.  Pours a reddish-brown with an off-white head that quickly dissipates.  Aroma is largely malt, with fruit and grain characteristics.  Taste is largely the same, with malt up front dissolving into a bread/grain characteristic and slight fruit on the end.  Thin body here but the flavor is there in SPADES...Nice everyday beer.","North Bellmore, New York, USA","thenick"
1333,"2008-05-22",3.7,"growler poured into a shaker has a red maroon color with a thin off white head and lighter carbonation. aroma has malt, light coffee, and slight fruit. mouth feel is a medium light and very smooth. flavor is predominately malted with a touch of bitter and biscuit. certainly ""quaffable"" as they put it very smooth and easy drinking. finish leaves a little bitters on the tongue. very rich and flavorful for a beer that does not have a big body to it.","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"
1333,"2008-05-15",3.8,"On tap at SPH 5/13/2008.  Arrived at the table a lovely clear reddish amber (more red than amber) with a thin linen white head that lasted through a few sips and left a few spots of lace.  Pleasant aroma of malt with a perhaps a hint of fruit detected as well.  The flavor was rich and malty with a real nice bready flavor in the aftertaste.  Very light bitterness at the finish.  Super smooth and very easy to drink.  I liked this one much better than their 80 Shilling.  Very enjoyable and well done!","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
