2224,"2010-09-24",3.8,"On tap at the Office.  Amber hue, lasting white head, much lacing.  Aroma of citrusy, piney hops and sweet malt.  Perfect balance of bready malt and piney, earthy hops on the palate.  Some toffee notes as well.  Light, smooth body.  Finish is short, but nicely balanced between hop bitterness and sweetness of the malt.  Well made, easy drinking Octoberfest.",", New Jersey, USA","mike67"
2224,"2010-09-09",3.3,"Pours a golden amber lightly hazy with light white head ... great aroma of mostly caramel malts and some bready malts with spices .... taste of lots of caramel kind of sticky mouthfeel, spices and toasted and bready malts with a nice hop bitterness to the finish ..... pretty rich brew and tasty
a solid representation","Penndel, Pennsylvania, USA","italianjohn"
2224,"2010-06-30",3.9,"(Old BA rate - cask) - Apparently my palate is screwed, or this is just great on cask.  Never tried it on tap, and can see that theres been something off about it...interesting. Poured a slightly hazy ruby-orange coppery color; little to no head (bad form on the pour by the bar). Apples; bready; some mild hops comes in; really pretty nice aroma. Aroma was definitely hiding things as the taste is really more interesting; rich maltiness, but not sweet; bready; hint of vanilla and some fruitiness. Medium and a little fluffy; no real carbonation happening (cask).Hugely drinkable, this was perhaps the most interesting example of the style that Ive had the chance to try and could be a supreme session brew for me","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"
2224,"2009-11-15",4.6,"I live by the Ramstein Brewery, and have always been impressed by the care that goes into their beers. Although I am not a big wheat beer fan which is their specialty.

I had a seasonal sampler at the Office Bar in Morristown, and the Ramstein Octoberfest was one of the beers. Simply put it blew the competition away"" including Sam Adams Winter and Climax Octoberfest.

This is the best Octoberfest beer I have had, import included. Clean crisp, malty it was just an exceptional lager.

I had a few more before I left the bar that night thinking I would stop by the brewery for a growler or two the next day, but they were sold out. Guess I am not the only one impressed.","New Jersey, USA","njmoons"
2224,"2009-10-31",3.2,"Deep amvber color, white head.  Very malty on the nose.  the flavor is sweet, malty, caramel, brown sugar.  The finish is not particularly clean, mostly sweet, very slight nobel hops. Decent, not great.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
2224,"2009-10-24",3.3,"(Draught) Reddish brown and clear. Small white head. Grassy aroma. Medium bodied palate with medium carbonation. Malts, bitterness, grass and caramell in taste. Malty and bitter aftertaste. Nice märzen and easy to drink as Oktoberfestbier should be,","Helsinki, FINLAND","mjs"
2224,"2009-10-12",3.5,"Liter draft. Pours a hazy dark amber, lively bubbles send streams up to a small head that settles quickly. Thick caramel malt aroma with a hint of spice. Fantastic! Vanilla and caramel malt dominate, bread and floral hop bitterness coming through at the finish. One of the best American examples of the style that Ive had.","Jersey Shore, New Jersey, USA","Bonster"
2224,"2009-10-09",3.0,"Tap at Sunswick: Still deep copper/amber with no head. Some grainy amber malts and mild DMS. Slick body with some mild caramelized  grainy amber malt and bready character. Some butter/mild diacetyl and lacking bitterness. A bit off.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
2224,"2008-10-11",3.7,"Growler fill from New Beer - Ramstein must have poor quality control, because I’ve had many of their beers come across as quite sour and infected, but when they aren’t, they’re damn tasty - this is the case here - I think a lot of people have had infected batches, thus the low ratings - this particular keg contains a slightly hazy, fizzy copper beer - not much of a head on it - a little doughy in the aroma, with some light floral hop notes and a bit of honey-ish sweetness - quite smooth and light-bodied - a bit of a hop bite paves the way for bright fruity notes, moderate munich sweetness, and lingering doughy/bready notes - some brisk herbal character and light bitterness on the back end - quite drinkable - this reminds me of why I continue to try their beers, regardless of how often I have an off one.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
2224,"2008-06-07",2.5,"Tap at Blind Tiger.  Deep ruddy-amber beer with a thick creamy white head.  Aroma is nicely malty initially with a light nuttiness as well.  There is also a pronounced sourness that reminds me (unpleasantly) of their hefeweizen that I tried recently.  The flavour is moderately sweet but there is a chemically/plasticy note.  Lingering metallic flavour as well.  I think this will be my last Ramstein beer for quite some time.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
2224,"2008-04-05",3.4,"on tap-pours a light tan head and amber color.  Aroma is malt-some sweet.  Taste is malt-some sweet, secondary hops.  OK carbonation.","Florida and, New Jersey, USA","jcwattsrugger"

2224,"2007-10-21",2.5,"Sample.  Pours a crisp golden brown with a generous light orange head.  Aroma was slight malt with not much else to report.  Taste was a bit harsh, with malt dissolving into nothingness.  Seemed a bit flat to me and not the wonderful experience you usually find in a good Oktoberfest.  I was disappointed.","North Bellmore, New York, USA","thenick"
2224,"2007-10-15",2.3,"Draft. A bit disappointing.  Right or wrong I expect Oktoberfest to be very drinkable lending itself well to a liter or two. This was a bit flat and left a slightly unpleasant sourness in the mouth.","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","Jayb0"
2224,"2007-10-05",3.5,"Draft. After a disastrous experience with their Altbier I had a Ramstein Marzen.  Well balanced and a good example of the style. Clear and delicious, malty flavour and medium hops.","New York, USA","Maverick34"

Average texture.  Soft carbonation.  Malty herbal finish.","King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA","michael-pollack"

2224,"2006-12-03",3.5,"On tap. Poured a dark copper / brown color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of toasted malts, caramel, and a little bready. Tastes of toasted nuts, caramel, bread, and I was getting a grassy / wheatiness to it. Finishes on the thin side.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
2224,"2006-11-18",2.7,"This draft brew from the brewery poured a head of foamy finely sized light tan colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a transparent uncarbonated copper brown colored body and an excellent lacing. The aroma was malty. The smooth mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of malt and Irish red malt. An OK brew just nothing special.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
2224,"2006-10-15",3.0,"Bottle from Leopoldstoch.  Pours copper with a rocky white head.  Smells of nutty malt and some earthy hops.  Taste is of sweet malt.  Some tea like elements are present on the finish.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
2224,"2006-09-23",3.4,"Bottle at oktoberfest at Dickinsonbeers.  Poured a clear amber with an off-white head.  Aroma of toasted biscuit dough, some light floral hops.  Flavor is some mostly malt-driven, with butterscotch, toffee, and a bit of grassy dryness, with some toasted caramelly biscuits.  Decent enough.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"
2224,"2006-09-22",3.8,"I had this at Ludwigs in Philly by default because they didnt have the 3 other beers I asked for.  serendipitous, i guess.  This was pretty darned good.  surprisingly hoppy and very malty.  Im not the biggest fan of oktoberfests because there is usually little variance.  This one packs a punch, too.  I got pretty buzzed off of a .5 liter of franziskaner and this fucker.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
2224,"2006-09-20",4.0,"sampled at brewery and bought a growler.  Deep copper with lively carbonation.  Aroma is toasted malt, bread, and caramel, some floral hops.  Taste is nice, malty, and smooth, toasted and dry biscuity malt apparent well balanced with hops.  at 6.5 %, no alcohol is apparent.  I thought the last Oktoberfest I had was the best one I had, but this is a beer that one ups it for sure. Very fresh.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
2224,"2006-09-15",4.2,"New batch from Greg.  This one comes in at 6.5% abv.  Pours a deep gold,  light copper with nice delicate carbonation and a fluffy lasting white head.  Aroma is loaded with toasted malts, light munich, and caramel hints.  Nice light caramel malts and toastiness in the flavor, bready malts, light herbal bitter finish.  Body is so smooth and loaded with tons of malt, wihtout even coming close to being too sweet.  Awesomely smooth and lingering finish that makes you want more.  The best Oktoberfest I have ever had.  Greg nailed this one.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
2224,"2005-10-11",3.5,"Unique take on a Marzen.   Ramstein O-fest has a toasted aroma and a definite maltier palate and spicy aftertaste than what Im used to in a Marzen.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","JFGrind"
2224,"2005-10-07",3.5,"On tap at Andys.  Solid red-brown oktober.   Good malt flavor with a slight bit of hops playing around.  Good representation of the style but not up to par with Ramsteins other beers, but that might just be because they are so good at wheats","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","Jine"
2224,"2005-10-04",3.8,"Draft at the Drafting Room, Exton.  The pour is deep copper, with aromas of caramel malt, brown sugar, some hops, nuts, and some cabernet notes.  Hefty palate, with a more finishing malt.  A solid marzen with a nice balance and complexity.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
2224,"2005-09-30",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2005  Tap in Philly.  Poured amber with a thick white head.  Very nice appearance.  Good caramel, courant and citrus flavors.  This is up at the top of the lists as far as Oktoberfests are concerned.  Very nice.","Princeton, New Jersey, USA","wnhay"

2224,"2005-09-24",3.7,"09.17.05  Tap at Andys.  Lasting and thick tan head above what appears to be a darker, reddish amber beer.  Fruity aroma reminds of fresh and ripe grains, multi-grain bread.  Full and slick body.  Slight pepper, salty pretzel.  Finishes moderately bitter with a soft feel.  Nice stuff.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
2224,"2004-12-31",3.7,"Had this today right at the brewwery. It started out  deep red in color. Malty with a clean hop kick. This is a very nice Fest.","West Paterson, New Jersey, USA","Lou18"
