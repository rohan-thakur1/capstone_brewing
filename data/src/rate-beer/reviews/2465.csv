2465,"2017-05-07",3.8,"I wonder if there is anything such as an ale versus beer camp these days? I
prefer ales as a rule and tend to find similarly flavored and well made lagers a bit lacking. Sure its the different styles of yeast, but I think the lagers lack the body, the heft of an ale. Anywho, draft at the brewery. Yes, it is very like unto Dogfish Heads 60 minute, previous caveats applied. A well made, well balanced brew, hiding its alcohol quite well. Aroma is dankness and mild citrus. The flavor is reminiscent of many a DIPA but not overboard on anything, citrus, bitterness, dankness. Crisp, medium bodied, smooth and creamy. In my own descending 1 to 5 ranking, I would rate this a #2 brew, not to be avoided by any means, but not one of the greats.","Massachusetts, USA","migwell"
2465,"2017-04-29",4.0,"Yet another great beer from Jacks Abby. The one pours the standard yellowy amber clear lager thing. The smell is piney, hoppy, nutty, with a little funk almost bretty-saisony. The flavor is more strident hops and resiny dank nuggs with more of a lagery mouthfeel to it than Jacks Abbys other IPL style offerings, which lean more aleish in taste usually despite the categorization. Still this one is very good, if not quite as good as I remember it being after having Excess IPL and Kiwi Rising.

2465,"2016-01-05",4.0,"This was poured into a pilsener glass.
The appearance was a glossy yellow color with a nice looking subtle carbonation rising to fill a one finger lasting head. It eventually dies off into a film of a head. Nice filmy/almost semi-thick foaminess in the rings looked nicely.
The aroma had some sweet grassy hops blending in with a little bit of spice smelling really nice.
The taste was moderately sweet and bitter blending the hops with a low crisp to sweet malt consistency. Theres a nice crisp bready/lager aftertaste leading into a nice semi-sticky sweet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a nice sessionable feel. Carbonation feels low enough to allow a nice bitter to sweet feel on my tongue, nothing overly done, feels nice and crisp.

2465,"2016-01-02",4.3,"Honningfarvet og ufiltreret amerikansk Imperial Pils / Strong Pale Lager med 2 cm hvid skumtop, som svinder til landskaber og senere et par mm. Rolig.
Frisk frugtagtig aroma af mandarin, pilsnermalt og lidt fjern citrus. Gærnuancer af kælder. 
Hold da op! Blød lækker mundfølelse indhyller den dejligste pilsnersmag med noter af mild frugt og bitterhed, men blid bitterhed. 
Meget veltilpasset karbonering og en del nedjusteret. Stor fyldig krop uden at være alkoholisk domineret, og cremet konsistens. Afslutningen er bitter, kort og let tør.

2465,"2015-07-10",5.0,"This is easily one of the best beers I have ever had. This is up there in my book with elevated ipa. There is just so much going on with this one its crazy. First thing you get blasted with in the aroma is huge citrus, dankness and tropical fruit and a nice sweet easy aroma from the lager yeast. I think the lager part of this beer is what makes it so damn good. I cannot even imagine the skill it took to make this beer. Taste is bitter and full of citrus and tropical fruit. Its so hoppy. I guess its clear I loved this one. Ive gotten bored with a lot of ipas now because they all taste the same and all are basically the same beer just packaged different.

2465,"2015-06-14",3.7,"355 ml bottle bought at The Bottle Shop in Sai Kung.
Looks: Cloudy hazy straw golden honey colour with thin traces of yeast sediments; One finger head with crumpety white foam which lasts for 2 minutes; Excellent sticky lacing with very slight carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant malt, with strong floral, pretty strong passion fruits, apricots, grapefruit zest, oranges, honey, molasses, strong pine, resin, light spices, biscuits, lemon and light grass.

Taste: Mid to light sweet malt, with strong lemon peels, grapefruits peels, molasses, pine, very strong resin, earth, biscuits, yeast, very strong lime, very strong and sharp bitter hops and grass.

Body: Mid to light. Slick, fairly thick and very oozy palate.

Mouth Feel: Solid maltyness in a not so rich body. Molasses sweetness is nearly offset by total dominance of extra citrus hops - strong fruit peels with not much flesh, lots of lime and resiny ooze, not to mention the ramped-up bitterness. Earthy spices and dry biscuits to round. The 8% booze is totally hidden. Very nice!

Hoppiness: Passion fruits, apricots, floral, oranges, grapefruit, pine and strong resin in nose. Very strong lime, citrus peels, strong resin, pine and earthy spices in taste. Bitterness is very sharp and strong (but not as expressive as those of German Pils) for a lasting, fairly strong astringent bitter-citrus finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Very limey and fruity-bitter to mouth.

Comments: Just as I thought, this one is like a pumped-up version of Hoponius Union, with notable difference in more bittering hops, Columbus I guess. The end result though is still pretty restrained, certainly not as outrageously piney-oozy as most IIPAs, but the citrusy aroma and taste is still neatly presented. Not mind-blowing but very sessionable. Lovely!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Malt is dry, not crystal-like, thankfully and add a touch of sourdough bread to the equation. Very little sweetness. Not as much heavy pine as the ABCS but the citric notes are very heavy and only somewhat broken up by the lighter, more playful tropical fruit notes. Alcohol is well-concealed, but some light vapors do emerge with warming.Bitter and dry, it immediately goes to work on the palate, though light caramel-like sweetness does both soften the palate and attempt to balance. It never balances out for me, especially as it warms and breathes, becoming ever more citric and heavily acidic. There are some very lovely floral and fruity notes here, but theyre heavily drowned out by all of the aggressiveness. Again, these lagers are intentionally extremely hopped and thats fine, just not my thing.

En bouche, laspect poivré est très accentué par la forte effervescence qui picote la langue jusquau fond du nez. Le corps de cette bière est moyen et les saveurs tardent à sestomper.

2465,"2014-09-29",4.0,"Jacks Abby has pretty much single-handedly invented a bunch of new beer styles. They only brew lagers, but in traditional ale styles. Mass Rising is their take on a Double IPA, which they, not surprisingly, dub as a Double IPL. It definitely does drink like a beer of the style, though. Huge hop flavor and bitterness using some of the most popular hop combinations of the day.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 7/28/14 and cost $3.99 ($0.33 per ounce).

Appearance: Bright pale yellow hue. Extremely hazy, but spastic carbonation can be seen. Pours to a huge, Duvel-like, white fluffy head which retains and laces extremely well.

Smell: Huge spicy hop aroma with notes of garlic, onion and lemon rind.

Taste: Im not sure which hops are in this beer, as theyre not listed on the label or the brewerys website. To me, it tastes a lot like Sorachi Ave  huge spicy notes with distinct onion, garlic and lemon rind flavors. An interesting combination to be sure, but they definitely do work. Strong dry bitterness from beginning to end (especially on the end, I might add). The malty backbone is strong enough to support the palette, though it doesnt add much towards the taste except for a slight stone wheat cracker-like flavor. It complements the hops well, which also leave a residual spice rack seasoning aftertaste. Definitely the kind of beer to pair with a savory meal.

Drinkability: Though quite hefty at 8% ABV, Jacks Abby Mass Rising is actually quite lithe. Since it is a lager, it does have a crisp mouthfeel and a body thats on the lighter side for its potency. It goes down smooth, but its better enjoyed in sips than gulps. No alcohol warmth or distraction, which makes it almost too easy to drink.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
2465,"2014-09-28",3.8,"Pours hazy yellow with a fluffy white head. Big time lemony aroma here with some grassy pine to go along with a hint of pineapple and honey.

Taste is sweet, bitter, fruity and herbal with sweet dark bread, biscuits, crackers, grapefruit juice, unripe mango, freshly cut grass, pine needles, resinous wood, alcohol, multi-vitamin fruit juice and lemon zest.

2465,"2014-07-25",3.7,"In short: A sweet blonde lager hopped the American IPA way. Simple well balanced good beer.
How: Bottle 500ml, consumed fresh.
The look: Mostly cloudy dark blonde body topped by a medium white head leavings thick lacings on the glass.
In long: The hoppy nose of medium intensity is very bright and has a citrus zest and pine needles character. In mouth the beer is full body with plenty of very soft bubbles. Taste starts with crunchy hay-like pale cereals, some honey, a little too much residual sugars (refined white sugars sensation). This is then followed by a generous hopping but without a bitterness overly assertive, just enough to balance the beer. Pine needles, citrus fruits, lemon zest, floral notes. A very good beer even if a little too sweet. I prefer their regular IPL (Hoponius) over this cranked up Double IPL. And after my latest trip to Vermont I can confirm you can go to the beer store just to pet bottles, theres no law against it.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2465,"2013-11-18",3.7,"Bottle courtesy of Mark. Thanks, dude! Pours a decent hazed golden orange hue, more pale yellow golden glow and lively hues in the body. Lighter, well carbonated with firm cakey offwhite head atop. Stays larger overall, sticks around, laces well enough. Aromas are fairly hoppy, earthy florals, grass, and gentle powder. Subtle pine, bready malts, gentle fruit presence. Some lemon, gentle fruity elements. Initial is lighter end of the fold, cool and dry, a bit powdery, firm bitterness meets some gentle eatery fruit, dough and apple, touches. Of lemon, florals. The middle nicely bitter, dry, fairly drinkable for an 8 percent ABV offering. Some pwoder, gentle citrus, dry cracked grain and florals, grass. A firm floral quality as we round the corner.. Firm hopping, more pine and florals, gentle grapefruit rind and juice show a little life. Pretty nice stuff, quite smooth overall with firm and strong bitter qualities, more earthy yet potent overalll. This grew on me quite a bit as I saddled into it, really nice appearance and flow and feel on the palate. While the flavors are assertive or complex, it really is well constructed. Nice stuff, probably one of it not the best of these new IPLs weve been seeing more of lately that Ive actually had. And Jacks Abby seems to be leading the way.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

2465,"2013-08-01",4.5,"The beer pours a clear golden yellow, like clean, yet dehydrated piss. The beer pours with a beautiful head of bubbles that sits well over two fingers widths above the beer and is made of a menagerie of different sized, creamy bubbles. When the head leaves, the beer leaves a lacing of long strings of medium width tiny bubbles alongside the glass. In body the beer is beautifully clean and pure, with just a slight haze coming from the malt. This is a pretty looking beer. On the nose, this beer is a damp head rush of everything I love about American hops. Big and bristling pine moves into smooth and juicy mango and pineapple notes with light hints of grapefruit and a touch of tangerines. There is also a slight dank smell lurking below all the other smells, and a touch of caramelly malt. Though I havent had Heady Topper for about a half a year, this beer smells quite similar to Heady to me. As it sits in my glass the dankness grows and bristles onto the nose, but there is some beautifully juicy fruit notes right beside it. This beer smells great. On the tongue, this beer is fearlessly bitter with just a touch of sweet on the finish to remind us that there is, in fact, malt in this beer. Slight touches of salt and acidity can also be sensed on the fringes of the tongue, but really, this beer is all about the beautiful bitters. In flavor, the beer begins as a blend of pine and tropical fruit juice, and the bitters gracefully build from there, trouncing over my mouth in perfect formation. Light biscuit cracker coincides with a deep dank flavor in the middle of the palate, though neither works its way in front of the fruity bitters which continue to work through the fruity flavor profile of hops, finishing with a big, bitter, grapefruit shiver that lingers into dank pine notes in the aftertaste. In the mouth, the beer is on the light side of medium, with near perfect carbonation working to caress the tongue like a soft pillow, even as the beers bitters bludgeon it. The mouth is left terrifically dry and slightly sticky, and though the tongue wets slightly, the mouth is just left begging for another sip. This beer is a masterpiece of hops, and I am loving it. A richly complex smell and flavor that work to be both thirst quenching and inspiring. This is an awesome beer to slug during the summer, but be careful, as its 8% alcohol never quite shows in the flavor. Try this beer for sure, and Jacks Abby please make this a regular!","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

My core emergent quality on this is grassy, unfortunately. Im having time digging into a fresh juicy component of this beer. I think its a little too over the top. The malt body washes away and theres a just this too many hops grassiness left over. I hate to say this, but I think Jacks Abby has really lost its shine. There have been a lot of ho-hum novelty beers and a general decline in quality of the mainstay hoppy lagers. I hope that expansion hasnt sacrificed quality there. 7/3/7/3/11


Another 500mL Bottle. Thanks for sharing, Rob. Aroma gives the impression of largely Mosaic build. Flavors are immediately tropical but dont hold on to much else.

Pours a crystal clear deep straw with a huge bubbly bone white head that takes forever to recede. Aromas of spicy onion and garlic with a bit of pine and dankness hiding a hint of bready sweet malt. The flavor is lightly bready but overpowered by resin pine and green onion. Smooth hop flavor with just a touch of bitterness. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. Nice beer, Im glad I found some of this.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
