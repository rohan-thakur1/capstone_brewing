>> Pours clear with minimal legs and low watery viscosity. Fresh garden and strawberry nose. Least boozy flavor of our sake tasting flight so chose to split a whole bottle of this one. Super clean and ricey taste, medium dry finish. Paired with food, it becomes much fruitier, no alcohol bite, juicy plum and pineapple. Clean finish. Quite nice.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Flavor is sweet rice and stewed fruits, peach, apricot, and a slight alcohol burn. Nice silky body. Good. Not terribly unique, but very solid.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
3585,"2013-03-06",2.4,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2013 Bottle at Benihana, pours like water, maybe a little gold tinted. No head or lacing. Nose is peach, pineapple, wood, and light anise. Flavor is citrus, rice, grain, vanilla and vodka. So much booze and bland. I have tried about 5 sakes in my life and I am now ready to give up on them. Just too much heat and not enough aroma or flavor profile. This mostly reminded me of watered down cheap vodker. Pass","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
