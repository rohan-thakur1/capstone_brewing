4114,"2016-12-29",4.3,"From notes. Enjoyed this at Mickeys 30th birthday bash on November 05. 500 mL bottle. 2015 vintage. The pour is a dark purple with no head to be found. This is lovely. It is a little thin, but leaves great stain on the glass. The aroma is just awesome. There is a ton of sweetness that balances out. There is a ridiculous amount of raspberry and a light chocolate to it. The fruitiness and jamminess really pile on the sweetness, but I like it. There is just a hint of alcohol on the finish. The flavor is much of the same. Really rich and forward with the raspberry, light honey, and decent wine character on the back end. The mouth feel is a little thin, but this clings to the mouth and imposes its will all over you. The jammy raspberry is just lovely. This is a damn good mead.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
4114,"2016-12-03",4.2,"Bottle shared with koleminer20 and Gus for the reunion of Meat Cloud and the Bird Dicks. Aroma is raspberry, booze, chocolate, sweet, good.

4114,"2016-05-02",4.3,"2 oz sample from kcherney, huge thanks for this one! Deep purple leaving some nice legs on the glass. Like others from the Berry White series, the aroma is so intense with loads of raspberries and white chocolate along vanilla, honey, mild alcohol notes and perfumy/jammy notes. Taste is super sweet but balanced by an interesting mild acidity, intense raspberry jam filled with white chocolate chips, raspberry seeds, honey, alcohol (not burning) and vanilla. Full body. Still. Rich, thick and vinous mouthfeel. Super jammy finish with raspberies, white chocolate and nice alcohol warmth. Easier to drink than the Black Berry White I tried a few days ago. Its super sweet, but so flavorful that its still somewhat drinkable (at least in small quanty). Extremely tasty, borderline too flavorful and sweet but it doesnt crosses the ""cloying"" line. Great stuff.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
4114,"2016-04-24",4.1,"Sampled this with Sparky accompanied by the rest of the Berry Whites. Dark violet hue that had sparkling amethyst at its edges. Still. Very sweet.

4114,"2014-06-24",4.8,"Pours a deep berry purple. Aromas are insane, like an old fashioned candy store. Tons of white chocolate, and more berry aroma than a bramble patch of berries. Flavor is beyond intense. The berry flavor smacks you right in the mouth. Its full on jammy berry. The white chocolate comes busting through with an intense, cocoa buttery sweetness. Make no mistake about it this is a dessert mead, a rather epic one at that. Its on the fuller side of body ...rich, sweet without being overly so.

Taste is schmead-level berry, in the best possible way. Massive raspberry from start through a tart finish. The white chocolate keeps coming through on the aroma as you drink it, but rides on top of the berry. Sweetness from it, but really well balanced. White chocolate can be cloying as hell, but it works wonderfully here. Id sip it as a dessert mead, but its plenty quaffable...Im racing through thoughts trying to pair it appropriately with something other than cheese. Its got enough sweetness to be moreso than many desserts and not fight them. My new fave from them, and thats saying something...","New York, USA","tchaos"

4114,"2014-04-15",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2014 Bottle share courtesy of Dak, thanks! It pours with a rug staining deep dark rosy red to purple body that leaves behind thick glass staining legginess. The aroma hits with both slick sugary honey goodness and nectar like berry notes where there is a modest degree of sweet smooth sugary smelling vanilla off in the background. This smells great. The taste has a wonderful play between rich nectar like fresh sweet berry juice thickened by honey and then flowing into a smooth modest sweet kind of white chocolate seemingly vanilla note. This is well crafted and delivers a wonderful rich mix of honey, berry notes and vanilla. Love this, wow! This is right up there with some of the best Ive been lucky enough to try. I had a splash of Schramms Statement to I can compare and to my surprise this was a little deeper richer and somehow embraced the fruit more.

4114,"2014-04-13",5.0,"UPDATED: APR 14, 2014 This might be the best mead Ive ever had. And Ive had a lot of them. Ive had Schramms.  Ive had Kuhnhenn.  Ive had B. Nektar.  Pours a deep reddish purple.  Smells like chocolate raspberry amazingness.  I saw someone taking like two minutes just sniffing it before even taking the first sip because the smell was so pleasant.  Taste was absolutely delicious, decadent white chocolate and raspberry flavor. Very deep and very rich. To me, this mead is the very definition of a dessert wine. If you have ever had the Ben & Jerrys Berry Voluntary ice cream (a Target exclusive flavor), it tastes EXACTLY like that, and trust me, thats a very good thing.  Before you open one, do yourself a favor and put on Barry Whites ""Never, Never Gonna Give You Up"" (the full version).  It will put you in the right mood for drinking this mead.

4114,"2014-04-13",4.0,"Bottle shared during a mead tasting hosted by daknole. Heavy aroma of blackberry and boysenberry, a sharp honey sweetness, some vanilla, a earthy vegetal tone and wet oak. Pours very dark purplish-blood red. An intriguing mesh of flavors explodes on the tongue with deep blueberry, a boozy heat, and moderately sweet honey with a tart finish. Thick palate for a mead (almost chalky), but it pairs well with the heavy taste. Very nice; one of my favorites so far from Superstition.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
