4093,"2016-12-29",3.0,"From notes. Enjoyed this on draft at the Drie Fonteinen lambik-O-droom on November 12. This is a 9 month old lambic. The pour is a dark coppery orange without a bit of head or lace. The aroma is incredibly sweet and earthy. There is a light metallic note to it and a strong wet oak. Its really interesting, because its unlike any other lambic Ive ever had. The flavor is much of the same. There is a light sourness to it, but its light. There is a heavy sugary sweetness that I dont really care for at all. There is a light Bandaid thing happening on the finish that is a turn off. The mouth feel is thick and syrupy with a real lack of carbonation and a lingeringly sugary finish. This is definitely young. Damn.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Served in a Drie Fonteinen tumbler.

This was taken from the barrel and was a young batch of lambic brewed at Lindemans. Served in a 1L jug.

Poured a nice slightly-hazed orange color with a bit of foam after a good pour, though that receded quite quickly.

The nose was full of cheese and socks with some earth and quite a bit of funk. It certainly doesnt sound appetizing, but it smelled incredible. Very complex even at this young age. The flavor was a bit more subdued, but still had all the same characteristics. A bit more funk and less cheese than the nose.

4093,"2011-04-09",4.5,"Last batch of brewed at 3 Fonteinen Lambic; Sampled July 2010 at 3F Lambikodroom
The beer is a hazed, copper-gold color and it arrives flat with not head as it was poured fresh from a traditional Lambic crock.  The aroma on this is quite funky in a mushroom, dank cheese sort of way.  A deeper inspection yields aromas of urea, a touch of a yeast bite, spicy wood notes that mix with spicy yeast / bacteria character, fresh cut wood plank aromas and a musky-musty-moldy mushroom note.  When I really dig I get a phenolic, medicinal leaning note as well as a deep, musky, barnyard Brettanomyces character.  The nose on this is just fantastically, though in some ways subtly, complex; it is just so well integrated and wonderful to this lover of Lambics.

The beer tastes tart, but not over-poweringly so; it is nicely lactic with a lemon like acidity in some way and this helps to accentuate a nice grapefruit like flavor to.  This is so cool and refreshing on this uncharacteristically, hot, Belgian, summers day.  The sourness is much softer due to the lack of carbonation.  This is light bodied, though it does have a touch of palate heft to it; I cant imagine the texture of this being any better than it is right now.  A touch of a musky note in the flavor, as well as some phenolic notes are here, but there are no really musky, over the top Brettanomcyes notes in the flavor.  

This is quite fantastic all around and I could easily drink a lot of this.  The nose is so incredibly complex and even though the taste is not nearly so, it is so refreshing and balanced that I hardly care.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Close to a 9 in all honesty. Clearly young but oh so much character. The only thing not in evidence are those wonderful barrel notes, that in my opinion, no one does as well as Armand.

4093,"2007-10-04",3.9,"Clearish golden hue, headless. Diplomatic aroma that feels clean at this young age. Citrusy and flowery character are prominent and feel fresh for a lambic. As it warms, the funkiness follows though and accompanied by lactic, yogurt-like acidity that refreshes and enhances drinkability. Remarkable integration in mouth where the word nuanced takes its meanings. Soft herbal touches, tannins and the fair medium body are a young and dynamic trio already thinking about the coup that they are going to make as they get older. Ambitious.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
