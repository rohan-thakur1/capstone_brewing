1758,"2016-03-13",4.1,"Draft...many times, not sure why I havent rated it. I guess this is the case for most beers that I drink on the Reg. Why is that? Who knows...maybe had something to do with why Ive never rated a beer a 5. Honestly, a Chuckanut beer should be one of my highest rated beers since I love to crush these fine, well crafted lagers that Im lucky enough to live close to that I get them fresh. Clean clear light straw golden with proper head showing. Grassy, slightly corny sweet notes melded together with light biscuit malt. Clean light body with prickly carbonation and just enough body throughout. Lightly hits the grassy Nobel hops, the toasted malt and slight corn sweetness all the way through.","Washington, USA","bvc"
1758,"2015-09-06",3.2,"On tap at Chuckanut, pours a war golden bronze with a medium beige head. Aroma brings out toasted nuts, bready malt, and a touch of overripe fruits. Flavour is along the same lines, with dry bready caramel malts, a touch of banana and some overripe fruits. Very malt-forward. Solidly made for the style.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

Med-full bodied with a slightly rough mouthfeel. The taste is caramel malts, cinnamon & biscuit. Pretty good, I just wish the mouthfeel was smoother/softer.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"

1758,"2013-11-16",3.6,"Draft at chuckanut. medium amber / bronze. Malty sweetness (toffee and some dark fruit), caramel; straightforward and tasty - I haven't had many Vienna lagers, but this is the best I've had.

1758,"2012-12-29",3.7,"As part of a sampler tray during my visit to Bellingham.   Golden clear witha huge fluffy sandy colored head. Light bready aroma and a slightly sweet grain flavor.  the hops come through a bit more than I expected and the full maltiness is not quite what I was expecting.  Nice and tasty, attenuated nicely and lingering slightly woody tang at the end.  Maybe a bit hoppy and bitter for the style.","Boise, Idaho, USA","IndianaRed"
1758,"2012-10-14",3.5,"Sampled at 10/12/2012 at GABF. This Vienna Lager pours a light gold color from the tap. Medium sized white foamy head. The aroma is caramel, fruity and sweet.

1758,"2011-10-15",3.1,"GABF 2011 Media Luncheon. Clear amber in color without a lasting head. Nice toffee aroma, with a slight herbal hop tone, and mostly biscuit overall. Flavor was off-sweet with a mild touch of hop bitterness. Mostly toffee with some floral and herbal hoppiness. Mild burnt notes, and typically light-medium body for the style. Decent.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
1758,"2011-04-09",3.7,"Draft at the Old Town. Pours an absolutely crystal clear medium amber with a beautiful dense creamy tan head. No lacing, and the head falls away after a few swigs, but its picture-perfect while it lasts. Toasty brown bread nose. Creamy medium body with lively carb. Toasty brown bread mid-palate with caramel blended in artfully. Mild malty finish. Flavorful and refreshing.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
1758,"2010-11-07",3.6,"Toasty doughy and earthy nose. Pours golden with a thin head. The flavor is nice and toasty with hints of dough, light carmelized flavors as well with a hint of earthy bitterness in the finish. Clean and crisp and very well done.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"

1758,"2010-03-03",3.2,"Bright copper colour (like a shiny penny).  It has that tinny, vaguely caramelly ""Am Dark"" nose.  Decent body but there remains that caramelly metallic taste that is too simple for such a beer.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1758,"2010-02-08",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2010 Draft at Fiddlers. 2/8/10

The folks at Chuckanut can do no wrong. Glowing orange pour with a modest head, lovely caramel flavors -- chestnuts and honey -- with enough bitterness on the close to really finish things up perfectly. Super toasty, like fresh-toasted whole grain bread. Im no expert on the style, but all I know is that I enjoyed this one immensely, just as I have every other beer from Chuckanut. These guys are turning me to teutonic lagers in a way that even a month in Germany failed to.  7/4/7/4/15=3.8
Revisit 2/25/10. Hopeless Chuckanut fanboy? Thats me. Bump to 3.8 for exceptional sessionability. When else would I order three straight pints of anything?","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
1758,"2009-11-13",3.6,"A: Small head that dissipated pretty quickly. Body is amber-colored and completely clear.

S: Light malt coming through, with some breadiness and caramel present.

T: Moderately sweet with caramel flavors, and a lightly bitter, dry finish. Goes down pretty smooth overall.

M: Medium-bodied with some slight creaminess, and average carbonation.

D: Nothing spectacular, but pretty decent. Goes down very easy. Id definitely like to try some more Chuckanut beers after having this one.","New Brunswick, CANADA","Berley31"

Taste is malty semi sweetness, some nice grassiness in the back. The grainy toast from the nose gives this a nice additional element. Smooth thin medium palate coats the mouth a bit but finishes really clean. Crazy drinkable. Super fresh and clean, nice.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
