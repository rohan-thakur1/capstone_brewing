smell is of wheat, apple, malt, a few hops, and dark fruit.

taste is creamy, wheat, malt, some hops, and a bit of the dark pitted fruits.  ends a little on the sweet side and creamy.","Bremerton, Washington, USA","robforbes"

789,"2011-10-06",3.3,"pours a dark amber, almost black with off white lacey head.malty aromas is an under statement. roasted flavors and very rich taste of malts and very minor taste of spices like a cinnamon.","Levittown, New York, USA","TomTiedemann"
789,"2011-09-19",3.6,"Draft pint. Hazy amber, thick beige head. Aroma of fruit, toffee and berry. Taste has a good amount of sweet fruit, doughy yeast, plum, raisin. There is a light amount of tartness that is very nice. Very smooth.","Washington, USA","Beerona97"
789,"2011-08-24",3.9,"Thanks Justin!  Dark toasty nose, little banana, hint of milk chocolate, some earthy moss.  Dense mocha brown, little sunset sienna.  Full bodied, more ripe banana and mild cocoa, overbaked cookie.  Kind of drops off toward the end and softens to a solid brew.  Warms nicely.  Well done.","Bothell, Washington, USA","scrizzz"
789,"2011-08-22",3.5,"Bomber. Pours a solid reddish brown color with an inch of foamy light brown head. The aroma is a mix of wheat, cloves, earthy malts and banana bread. The taste starts out strong on the cloves and caramel malt with the addition of some banana, toffee and butterscotch. The body is mildly creamy with strong carbonation and a malty, clove finish. Overall, a respectable interpretation of a classic German style.","Seattle, Washington, USA","CampesinoTino"
789,"2011-08-17",3.7,"Bottle.  Pours a medium earthy brown with light off-white head.  Like everyone else has said, banana in the aroma.  Taste very smooth and is of fresh banana bread.  Slightly roasty.  Excellent brew!","Seattle, Washington, USA","improvjock"

789,"2011-07-03",3.8,"Bomber poured into an Allagash chalice. Im comparing this to the Franziskaner Dunkelweizen I had right before this. It pours identical to the Franziskaner: cloudy amber with a large beige head with great retention. This one leaves better lacework, though. This one smells of clove, popcorn; banana and bubblegum are there but a little fainter. Altogether not as aromatic as the Franziskaner. Taste is similarily sweet and meaty; theres a hint of spice (cinnamon?) in the finish; alcohol is noticeable. Carbonation and body are medium and the mouthfeel is creamy. I have to give the (slight) upperhand to Redhook here, which I admit isnt very fair, considering the fact that I think the Franziskaner was expired (yes, I know I gave them both a 3.8. For the taste, I would give this probably something like a 7.6 and the Franziskaner a 7.1 or so.). Gosh dont I sound nerdy.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
789,"2011-07-01",3.8,"On Tap at Portsmouth, NH location. Great looking deep brown color with thin white head that left light lace. Smell and  taste is spot on for the style. Very tasty and I drank 3 pints with ease. This is a limited run, get it while you can.  Very close to a true German Dunkelweizen. This brew is NOT bottled on the East Coast, draft only.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
789,"2011-06-15",3.0,"Bottle with Andrew and Carla. Pours a reddish gold with tan foam. Smells heavily of bananas and cloves. Tastes of caramel, bananas, wheat and oats.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Nikiel"
789,"2011-06-01",3.6,"Bottle: &nbsp Deep dark reddish caramel, moderate to large frothy off-white head, rather sticky lacing. &nbsp Looks pretty good. &nbsp Strong wheaty and banana bready like nose. &nbsp Certainly wheaty on the tongue, a little dark with faint roasted characteristics. &nbsp Has a bit of banana can clove to it too. &nbsp I am actually liking this more than I thought I would, simply because of the body. &nbsp Its really like a Hefe with some roasted malt characteristics. &nbsp  I only wish this one was a bit sweeter. &nbsp As is its not bad at all. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate to full. &nbsp I am enjoying this one more than I thought I would. &nbsp Only thing I would add is that it could use a bit more sweetness to balance the roasted malts. &nbsp Other than that, not half bad!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"

789,"2011-05-20",3.6,"22oz bottle from Roths Keizer store. $4.99
Hazy mid-brown beer with a large frothy light tan head.
Nice phenolic/bubblegum aromas,slightly fruity( plum). Nice
Smooth taste..it has all the elements of a dunkleweisen though..mainlly the banana phenolic. Spicy in the end even peppery.
MOuthfeel is smooth with low carbonation..slightly dry on the finish.
Overall a nice beer and at least representative of the style.
Nice to see Redhook continue the comeback.
Keep it up.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
789,"2011-05-12",3.2,"22. Pours a murky dark amber with a dense and rocky light tan head. Lots of webby lace. Big banana and clove nose, lots of brown bread and caramel as well. Creamy medium body, shows a lot of grainy heft for a lager, but does get a bit watery near the finish. Toast, caramel, banana, clove, and molasses on the mid palate. Mild bready sweet finish. Certainly pleasant enough.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
