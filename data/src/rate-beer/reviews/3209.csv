3209,"2015-05-08",4.2,"12 pack of bottles drunk 6/28/14 and onwardsThe reason I know the date I had this is because I posted on Facebook, ""Early candidate for beer of the Summer."" And Ill maintain that very much so. Sierra Summerfest 2014 wasnt its best year (certainly wasnt the worst, but still had a lot of resin and breadiness) so this one was an easy go-to. Similar to Jabby Brau in the malt/body department, being very nicely attenuated but still with enough texture to balance the hops. This one is certainly less hoppy than Jabby Brau (and most craft brewed lagers) but still has a light bitterness and some herbal-pepper notes that do just enough to balance but leave a focus on the delicious malt. Not quite creamy, as that would imply too sweet and heavy a texture, but just the exact amount of malt chewiness and depth of flavor (brown bread, baguette, light sourdough). Delicious. And of course appreciated by no one on this damned site. I hate you all.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3209,"2015-01-26",3.1,"A light grainy malt aroma. Solid pale yellow but with a slight haze. A quick bubbly white head but doesnt last long. Taste is slight grain and lemon zestiness in background. Has a light tart finish that is refreshing.","Foxboro, Massachusetts, USA","rjplumer"
3209,"2014-11-04",3.1,"If the macro lagers tasted like this, Id be more apt to drink them. Crisp, soft carbonation, slightly sweet, corn, wheat, and a hop presence that is nice. Easy drinking, great for drinking multiples.","Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerathon"
3209,"2014-10-15",2.9,"12 oz. bottle purchased at Julios Liquors. Yep.... Aroma and flavor are the same.
The flavor is corn, mild sweet grain with a mild grassy hop. Light body with mild bitterness. Body is on the watery side. Well, the brewery nailed the style BUT.... producing a macro tasting lager for a craft market? I enjoy this breweries more creative offerings.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3209,"2014-10-11",3.2,"Bottle from a trade with WillRunForBeer. Pours hazy straw color with white head. Cereal malt and grassy aroma. Lightly sweet malt flavor with grassy hops. Light to medium body with average carbonation. Thanks Brian.","Winter Springs, Florida, USA","smith4498"
3209,"2014-09-20",3.0,"12-pack from Julios. Cant beat the price at $10.99. A very pale yellow brew. Fluffy white head. Light malty flavors throughout. Some fizziness. Pretty boring, honestly.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","MaBeer1972"
3209,"2014-09-02",3.4,"Pale yellow beer with a quickly disappearing white head. Nose with a little malt and a little lemon. Clean, crisp beer with cracker and lemon cookie notes.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
3209,"2014-08-29",3.2,"Draft sample at the brewery. Clear gold. Clean, simultaneously smooth and crisp, refreshing, biscuit, hint of lemon. Medium carb and feel. Top notch for a lighter lager. They were out of bottles to-go so Im very glad I got to try this. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone","Middletown, New Jersey, USA","John25"
3209,"2014-08-25",3.1,"Taster from Tap at the brewery. Very pale gold. Light malt nose and a kiss of hops. Light, crisp flavor, tasty lemon and biscuit. Very light and drinkable summer beer, not a whole lot going on though. Well done for what it is.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"

3209,"2014-08-24",3.0,"Crushable macro lager taste without the off putting metal or corn. Light hops, pale cracker malts and a light macro skunk insets.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
3209,"2014-08-23",3.1,"Pours gold into a shaker. Tried many times over the summer from the bottle and found it to be very clean. Bright white head crackles and recedes to nothing. Sourdough biscuit aromas. Very dry with sweet caramel and hay. Not for me, but prefer it to any macro lager - and like to support this brewery.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
3209,"2014-08-20",3.8,"The beer is pale yellow. Fairly hazy. Nice-sized white head, a bit fizzy. Dissipates after a minute. Its lemony with a really nice lager yeastiness to it. Bright, fresh grain. Mild floral aroma. Good bite of lager tartness on the palate. The finish has a gentle hop bite, grassy and floral. Very clean and refreshing. Quite dry. Soft feel, yet stays pretty crisp. Really gentle and easy to drink. Spreads out on the palate, just a pillow of lager. That soft mouthfeel combined with the fresh grain and mildly sour lager yeastiness works very well. I could drink this all day.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3209,"2014-08-15",3.3,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. The pour is basically pale yellow with a short-lived white head. The aroma is grains, malts, barley, but little in the way of hops. The body is light to medium. The taste is also quite grainy and mildly malty with a mild hop character. This does have something worth trying if you enjoy the style.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"

3209,"2014-07-04",3.2,"12oz bottle. Pours a pale yellow with a white head. Pretty basic lawn mower beer. A decent clean lager but nowhere as great at most of JAs other lagers.",", Massachusetts, USA","BroSpud"
