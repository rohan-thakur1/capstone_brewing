1277,"2014-06-20",3.5,"Reviewed from notes.
This was poured into a pint glass at their brewpub location in the Atlanta airport. This was consumed last September (2013).
The appearance was a nice hazy orange to brown color with a decent looking half fingered white foamy head that dissipated within less than twenty seconds. There was some light lacing arranging itself in no apparent reason as it just sort of danced all around the glass (okay, no worries, I guess).
The smell had the authentic yet slightly typical British malts amplifying some nice light caramel tones.
The taste was mainly sweet and though it seemed like it wanted to steer away from that ""British soapiness"" usually found in ESBs that most Americans dont like, I still found it. But this doesnt bother me as I understand this is part of the style. No worries.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body and had a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation seemed right on for the style and good for me.
Overall, good ESB, well worthy of having again, now wheres my fish n chips.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
1277,"2014-05-05",3.2,"Sweetwater did this ESB right. Great malty profile with earthy hops and a dry yeast that adds a little bit of esters to the brew. Not a quaffing beer, but close.","North Dakota, USA","GreatDane1632"

1277,"2014-01-03",3.1,"Crisp amber and deep copper coloured body with a nice two centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of earthy malt, toffee, light hops and a subdued nuttiness thats noticeable at the end. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong toffee and malt flavours with a light dose of english or low alpha acid hops noticeable and a light sweetness as well. Aftertaste shows a bit of earthiness, a good malt and toffee flavour and some very light hops. Overall, not such a great beer - lacking way too much on the hop profile and only showing a little of the earthiness and toffee flavours throughout - not enough complexity.

1277,"2013-10-14",4.0,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.

Pours a clear medium copper with a very thick and billowy off-white head. Amazing, rock hard head retention but somewhat lacking in lacing.

Lots of citrusy American hops in the aroma along with a moderate amount of toasted malt and some caramel. Really nice hops/malt balance here.

Lots of juicy, citrusy hops up front quickly followed by toast and caramel and a touch of roast. Hops are a bit fleeting, though, as they fade away a little too quick as does the malt flavor. What you are left with is a lingering light sweetness and a mild bitterness. It is very pleasant although I wish the flavors were a little more bold.

Overall, a very nice beer from Sweetwater. Really fits the fall season and a nice alternative to pumpkin brews and Oktoberfests.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

The taste of the beer fits well into the ESB style beer, has a great malty, carmel flavor with some great back door bitterness to it. The afterfeel is okay with some mild bitterness and some carmel flavoring to it.

Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied, just slightly sticky, highly carbonated in the mouth (almost like drinking a cola), somewhat dry finish.

Flavor: Fairly well balanced as the hops dominate from start to finish  pine, citrus, and floral, even a hint of English type earthy hops. The biscuit quality of the malt helps to even out the taste and there is some caramel sweetness also.

1277,"2012-11-20",3.7,"The palate to Sweetwater Motor Boat Ale is everything I would expect in an American Pale Ale, but since its an ESB (extra special bitter), its not exactly what I want in the style. Thats not to say Im all about conforming to style, far from it, but theres something to be said for expectation. This beer is nothing like Wells Bombardier or Fullers ESB, and is more akin to any standard American Pale Ale.

I received a 12oz bottle in a beer trade with Ding. I poured it into a nonic pint glass.

Appearance: Hazy brown/burgundy hue. Forms a large, beige, frothy head which is slow to dissipate and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Light citrus notes, especially orange. A sweet candy scent and a hint of pine needles.

Taste: Sharp bitterness right away with a light sweet orange candy flavor through the middle. The hops impart a significant bite and dry astringency throughout the second half of the swig. The aftertaste is a lingering bitterness but nothing intolerable. Id definitely prefer a stronger, more balanced malt character, but the by-the-book hop profile is at least satisfying. 

Drinkability: This is a perfectly medium-bodied beer all around. A crispness to the body thats not overly fizzy. It goes down smooth and is actually quite refreshing while in the mouth, though it is rather drying afterwards. Sweetwater Motor Boat Ale has a lot of flavor for 5.6% ABV and sits much lighter on my system than most beers of that potency. Ideal for dinner, but too strong to session.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

I poured this brew into my glass an produced a two finger off white head on top of a hazy amber colored. I was surprised to find more hops coming from this nose than there IPA.
There was a nice bitter flavor followed up with some sweet malts. This to me would be more hop forward than most ESB I have drank. It had good carbonation and I enjoyed drinking it. The problem I have with this brew was it meddled for the style. I just dont think it that true to a ESB. I guess thats why I dont judge at the GABF.

Smell: Not much actually. Lots of bready biscuit like malt with some hops hiding in the background. My bottle says best before 12/8/08 (less than a month away) so Im sure it isnt the freshest bottle and that has contributed to the muting of the hops.

Taste: While I dont believe it is very traditional for the ESB style, Im really liking the taste of this brew. Mainly some toasty malts and some buttery qualities that lead into a palette flash of hops. Beer finishes with another dose of malt. Nice!

Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Good amount of carbonation and a slightly thin medium body makes this one go back like water.

Tons of grapefruit-like citrus with dry grassy notes. Subtle malty notes linger behind the intense hoppy aroma. The malts are very noticeable in the flavour, though. The initial flavour is of sweet biscuits and toffee with a light hoppy dryness and bitterness. As the brew passes the tongue, the hops quality matches the malts and creates a very nice balance. Citrus also becomes more evident. The finish is only slightly dry. But the malty qualities keep it a little on the smoother side. This is quite delicious.","California, USA","BossHossBikes"

The palate is a little thinner than I was expecting, but it’s smooth and pleasing nonetheless. Definite English malts on this one with toffee, burning leaves, and buttered biscuits. The hops are much more apparent in the aroma, though they add a decent level of dryness to the flavor. Sweetwater is awesome.

1277,"2008-09-12",3.4,"12 oz. bottle purchased at Total Wine in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a reddish-amber body with a small, frothy, ivory-colored head.

Smell: Aroma smelling strongly of spice and plump citrus fruits overlaying lighter notes of day-old, over-cooked biscuits.

Taste: Toasted biscuits with a touch of grain and even less caramel sweetness. Taste of citric grapefruit, maybe a few berries in there as well. Spicy, citrus hops with a medium bitterness. Sugar hints come and go throughout. Finishes dry, with an herbal quality to the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-high carbonation.

Drinkability: Some pair up beers with fine cuisine, maybe some even pair up beers with music. Me, I set beers up alongside movies. This bitter brew contrasted nicely to the sweet, satisfying ending of Karate Kid when Daniel defeats Whatshisname from Cobra Kai. Although the bitterness comes rushing back when I see Karate Kid 2 is up next.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
1277,"2008-09-08",4.0,"12oz bottle. Pours a brilliant copper with hints of soft pinkish amber and a medium-sized, off-white head that leaves beautiful streaks and spots of lace on the glass as it goes down. The aroma is a nice balance of spicy hops with subtle citrus and sweet, honey-covered croissants. The flavor follows the nose: a nice spicy, evergreen hop note combined with delicious, sweet, caramel malts. Flavor has some nice notes of toasted bread and hints of earthiness in that delectable bitterness. At mid-tongue, the flesh is tickled by the wonderful, spicy, bitter hops and carbonation - a subtle sting that is sweet to the touch. The finish is malty and also nicely hoppy. The mouthfeel is medium in body and well-carbonated, but overly carbonated - just right for style (which is American Amber I’d say, not ESB). Overall, a really magnificently balanced, drinkable, delicious American Amber. I have fond memories of Sweetwaters old ESB (their staple before 420 took off as their flagship). They no longer make ESB, but this makes me think fondly of it again - despite the fact that it isnt likely anything like it and is probably much, much better (its been years since they stopped making the ESB, so I cant really remember...the original ESB may have been more like... well, an ESB). Quite a treat.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"
1277,"2008-09-07",3.8,"12 oz. bottle.  Pours a deep, clear amber color.  Thin, off white head.  Decent amount of lacing.  Wonderful hoppy aroma.  Flavor is pefectly balanced between the bready malts and the floral hops.  Long bitter finish.  This is one gem of a beer.  Great job Sweetwater for this Catch & Release.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","KieferUGA"

1277,"2008-09-01",3.9,"12oz bottle.  Deep ruby red, off-white head.  Beautiful.  Smells great.  Nice west coast c-hop aroma, lots of chocoate malt in the nose as well.  Super tasty.  Flavor of caramel, some bread, chocolate, and some distant cotton candy sweetness.  Finishes with a superb bitterness.  Nice touches of gratefruit.  I let a non-beerdrinker take a sip.  she took two and loved it.  This may be the most impressed I’ve been with a Sweetwater offering since having 420 for the first time in the 90s!","Georgia, USA","unclemattie"
1277,"2008-09-01",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2008 Really red.  One of the reddest beers Ive seen.  Great color.  The small head is cream colored.  Very hoppy aroma, full of centennial or cascade type hops.  Good malt backbone.  Reminds me of their IPA a bit, but with more of a caramel flavor.  Good job.

Re-rate.  Had to add some points.  Great beer.  Comments above stand, just decided it was worthy of a higher score.","Hoon, Georgia, USA","pintocb"
1277,"2008-08-29",3.9,"motor boat pours a clear rusty amber with no lacing under a frothy yellowish head and bits of sediment floating around.  sweet shortbread cookie, cake, candy-like aroma with floral hops.  excellent balance with the sugared-cookie-bready-21st birthday cake malts and floral hops in flavor.  medium bodied, smooth and dangerously drinkable...damn.  way better than the last catch and release creation ""road trip"".","","SSSteve"
1277,"2008-08-29",3.4,"Pours copper with a small white head, no lace.  Aroma is pretty nice, with bready malt and light hops.  Taste is a little more subdued, in my opinion, with light hops and more of the bread malt.  Finish isn’t all that bitter.  Mouth is medium-bodied and carbonation is light.  Overall, a nice brew with a nice aroma, though not all that bitter or memorable.","Athens, Georgia, USA","Hank1980"
1277,"2008-08-28",3.3,"Pours a light, clear copper with a very short-lived off-white head that leaves a very thin ring and no lacing at all. The smell is very light with biscuity malts and a hint of earthy hops on top. The taste is a bit bigger than the aroma and starts with a kick of grassy hops up front before giving way to a slightly sweet bready malt background. The finish is dry with a little bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium with light to moderate carbonation, very crisp and dry in the finish. The drinkability is fairly high on this with the bitterness being pretty subtle. All in all, a decent effort from Sweetwater and Im hoping they continue to branch out in the near future.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
