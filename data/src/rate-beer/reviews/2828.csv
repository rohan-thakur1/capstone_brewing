2828,"2013-03-27",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2013 Hazy gold, opaque and murky with heavy lace, light small bubbled white head. Dusty nose is incredibly grassy, cedar, faint vitamin c. Really tight. Dry flavor is lightly sugary, doughy with toast accents mid, ends bright, light earth C contrast, fizzy carbonation and chalk accent. Nice and tight, but not the grain and dryness of their best.1) Smaragd

2828,"2013-03-23",3.9,"Tap at Victory. Sparkling clear straw. Sheets of white lace. Nose is sweet yellow apple, fresh lemongrass, fresh zesty orange. Taste is Doughy, sharp, no metallic character like many Czech pilsners, fresh orange peel. Palate is super Doughy and quenching. Awesome.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
2828,"2013-03-19",3.8,"Draft at the brew pub. Pours hazy yellow with a small white head and tons of carbonation in the aroma has a nice grassy and biscuit note. The taste is lightly bitter with a coating of the mouth in biscuit. Very nice for the abv. Nice body, impressed.","Spring City, Pennsylvania, USA","boxofrane"
2828,"2013-03-03",4.3,"On tap at Tylers in Carrboro.  Another great pils from Victory.  Gorgeous golden pour with healthy amount of creamy, lacy foam.  Strong aroma of earthy, herbal hops.  Clean and crisp with a blast of minty, floral hops.  Bitter, but with plenty of bready maIts to round things out.  I love this beer!  Great American take on a classic German style.  I could drink this everyday and not get tired of it.","North Carolina, USA","maslupulos"
2828,"2013-03-03",3.8,"On tap at Brewpub. Pours clear light gold with white head. Hay, floral, lemon. Moderate bitterness. Light, crisp body.","Wayne, Pennsylvania, USA","pilgrimoutlaw"
2828,"2011-10-02",3.9,"A: Golden-orange body. Moderate white head. Good lacing.

S: Mostly floral/grassy hop notes. Some citrus tones come through as well.

T: Solid floral bitterness is complemented with delicate citrus flavors in the middle. Good balance.

M: Crisp, moderate body. Suffers from a slightly off finish. A friend called this the ""Saphir Pils with funk""

O: Overall, a nice easy drinking pilsner.. Id take the Saphir or the Prima pils over it however.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
2828,"2011-01-27",4.0,"Golden color, pours smoothly and with a nice head.  Classic pilsner aroma, lively attack with a full, malty pilsner body.  Crisp finish, great drinking beer!  My favorite American pilsner so far.","Lebanon, New Jersey, USA","RGDave"
2828,"2010-06-04",4.0,"(Old BA rate - tap, BT 09)
Clear, light orangeish yellow color; and poured with a half-finger of pure white foam. OK retention, some spotty lacing. Grassy and earthy hop dominance (good stuff); almost a savory aroma from the hops. Really not much to mention otherwise, but I dig it. As suggested in the aroma the hop bitterness comes through the most; grassy and damn near salty; lingering dry bitterness. Lighter to medium body; pretty muted carbonation, a little more spritz would have been nice. Damn fine here; dry nature","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"
2828,"2009-07-26",4.4,"Wow another killer pils at BT for the Victory promo night.  Pours a nice bright slight hazed straw golden with a fluffy cloudlike head on top- crazy good lace.  Aroma is very bready rich creamy and doughy malts, and just tons of very soft floral hallertauer hops- light zest, but just very herbal and flowery.  FLavor is so clean, doughy malts have a great backbone adn just a very fresh medium amount of floral hoppiness, lightly grassy and just very clean and insanely smooth to drink.  Crazy good.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
2828,"2009-07-10",3.9,"Very pale straw-coloured beer.  White head.  The aroma is very zesty and spicy.  Very bright lemony herbal nose and a crisp/crackery pale malt.  Very fresh and tasty with a long herbal bitter finish.  Nice beer for a hot summer day.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
2828,"2009-07-06",3.7,"Tap at the Blind Tiger. Nice unfiltered pour. Delicious, spicy german hop aroma, biscuity and dry and lovely. Spritzy rich hop flavor. Easy drinking. Quite nice.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
2828,"2009-07-01",3.0,"More or less like a typical pilsener.  The aroma is malts, grass, lemon, sweet.  The flavor followed almost exactly.  the appearance was very true to the style, straw yellow, white head.  Mildly hoppy in the flavor, and at the finish.  Slightly spicy as well.  Decent.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
2828,"2009-06-20",3.2,"CBC Hallertauer, Tap at the restaurant brewpub.  Porus golden with a bright white head.  Nose is slightly sweet, taste is malty hoppy, with a lot of bitterness.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
2828,"2009-06-19",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 22, 2009 Draft at the brewery.  As with the other CBC stuff, a clear golden pour.  Very clean and fresh on the nose, but with a strong herbal presence the others lack.  The distinguishing trait of this one is the hops variety, whcih lends itself as very herb-forward.  Fairly sharp and poignant for a pilsener, but very refreshing still.  The Victory CBC moniker is a lofty one in my eyes.  Great, but probably the weakest of the 3.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
2828,"2009-06-08",3.5,"Draft at Brewpub in Downingtown, PA. Pours a light gold. Aroma is light. Taste is refreshing hop - apparently Hallertauer hops.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2828,"2009-06-06",3.4,"Sample @ brewpub.  A refreshing single citrus hopped brew. Notes of tangerine and spice.  Bitter finish.","Manhattan, New York, USA","Pwn3d"
2828,"2008-09-18",4.0,"Tap at Victory. Pours a hazy golden with a medium bubbly/creamy white head that left lacing.  Aroma of that fresh/spicy noble hops that you would expect from the Hallertauer, bready, floral, grassy with lemon and other mixed citrus notes.  Flavor was a lot of the same.  Bitterness is really nice and hop flavor is showcased wonderfully in this great Pilsner.  Loved it.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
2828,"2005-03-08",3.7,"Pours a hazy gold body with a foamy white head that left some serious lacing.  The aroma was lemons, oranges, and fresh bread.  Very nice flavor.  Sweet lemony citrus and fresh cut grass taste with a belgian-like finish.  Definately a very nice pils.","New Providence, Pennsylvania, USA","axilla"
2828,"2005-03-01",3.7,"On tap @ brewery: Cloudy golden yellow with a medium white head.  Aroma: lemon, citrus, grass, mild hops, sweet light malts.  Taste: lemon, citrus, grass, yeast, medium sweet.  Very crisp.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"
2828,"2005-02-28",3.7,"On tap at Victory. Poured a medium, cloudy golden color with an averaged sized white head. Aromas and tastes of citric lemons and light grass. Very drinkable.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
2828,"2005-02-27",3.6,"Poured a cloudy, light yellow color with a small, white head, that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of bread, and grass and lemon hoppiness.  Taste was rather sweet, more lemon (I think from the hops) and bread, more citrus, and a dry finish.  A nice, crisp, and dry pilsener.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
2828,"2005-02-23",3.7,"Draft at Victory.  Slight hazy gold pour with aroma and taste of hops, malt, some citrus.  This one is very hoppy, with a semi-dry finish.  I still prefer the Prima, but this one is very good also.  I really hope Victory makes more styles this year.  Id love to see Oak barrel Storm King and Oaked St. Victorious.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
2828,"2005-02-13",3.0,"I had the 2004 draft at Victory.  I love their Prima Pils and had high hopes for this one, but was somewhat disappointed.  Cloudy yeasty gold  I have always thought of lagers and pilsners as crystal clear.  Taste has the salty finish of a prima or other pilsner, but lacked the complexity and the full awesome hopiness of their Prima.  I would be interested in trying it again, but I did not love it.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"

2828,"2001-12-12",2.8,"Definitely not Victorys best or one of the best pilseners, but ok.  But then again, Im not a big pilsener fan, so take my opinion with a grain of salt....","Palm Bay, Pennsylvania, USA","Todd"
2828,"2001-11-28",3.9,"Mouthpuckering hoppy.  Noticed a hint of sulfur in the flavor.  Good beer, but I prefer the Prima Pils.","New Brunswick, USA","aledrinkerLS"
2828,"2001-07-27",4.6,"Fan-freakin-tastic.  Ive never had such a hoppy pils and its just a wonderful thing.  The aroma is herbal/spicy/grassy and just full of Hallertauer aroma - and what a fine hop it is.  The beer isnt real bitter though: it has a nice round malt base, and a generally sweet profile, complemented with a good dose of hop flavor (similar notes as in the aroma).  Light yellow gold with a bit of a chill haze, good foamy head and long lingering lace.  I loved it so much I brought some home in one of their big German-style 68oz growlers.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
