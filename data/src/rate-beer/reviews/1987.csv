1987,"2014-03-19",3.3,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2014 Bottle: Thanks, Kevin! Pours a nutty, mahogany brown color with slight clarity, topped with a swampy ecru skin that turns into an actual head when the glass is swirled. Initial aroma has a strange, almost tart dark fruitiness that was throwing me off, but it seems to subside with some warmth/time. Successive inhales bring out rich coffee beans, like sticking your nose into a fresh whole bean bag. Notes of roasted nuts, tobacco, toffee, & dried dark fruits make their way in, too. Taste has a very woodsy essence with a big nuttiness that leads into a huge coffee bean profile. Good mix of roasty & just lightly sweet. Touch of cocoa powder with more coffee & nuts in the finish. Aftertaste has a very slight staleness but nothing too concerning. I know it¬ís just a brown ale, but a little more creaminess in the body would do this one well.

1987,"2013-10-23",4.3,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a mug. There was no freshness date. I got this from a friend in Florida (thanks, Matt!).

Appearance: Seemingly opaque brown, but actually a dark, murky shade of ruby red. Some carbonation visible. Pours to an average-sized, tan, foamy head which retains and laces well enough.

Smell: Discernible brown ale maltiness with milk chocolate and iced coffee.

Taste: We tend to associate coffee beers with stouts, but why not brown ales? After all, their inherent sweetness helps to pair with the natural confectionery flavors often found in coffee brews. Cigar City Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale is a great example of what I mean. 

This beer is essentially a liquid candy bar - complete with flavors of milk chocolate, vanilla, caramel and of course coffee. You don¬ít tend to taste coffee in candy bars all that much, but here it¬ís used as a flavoring complement, rather than raw bitterness and astringency you tend to find in coffee stouts. It¬ís not that it works better here, just differently. It¬ís indeed quite sweet, but the bitterness from the hops and the espresso beans prevent it from becoming cloying. Well-balanced for sure, but still sweet enough to work as a dessert or to pair with a cheese tasting.

Drinkability: What really impressed me about Cigar City Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale wasn¬ít just how much I enjoyed the palette, but how easy it was to drink. As much as I love imperial stouts that offer a similar flavor profile, they can be quite taxing. This brew has the lighter body, calmer, more comfortable mouthfeel and smoother finish I prefer in a standard beer. There¬ís a lot of flavor for only 5.5% ABV, though it¬ís so light on my system I¬ím quite tempted to open another bottle immediately.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Appearance: The body is hazy with a copper to mahogany hue, accompanied by a towering light tan head that is thick and has excellent retention.
Aroma: The aroma is of fresh coffee with a cocoa and vanilla backing, very appealing. I¬ím reminded of a coffee house, though the aroma could use a little more presence.
Taste: Light caramel on the intro which is quickly matched by roasted coffee, resembling a caramel drizzled coffee, with vanilla undertones and a lingering coffee and cocoa. Very drinkable, very nicely done. This could use a little more malt base though.
Palate: A bit thin, but decent body with light to moderate carbonation.
Overall: This is a good brown ale, bordering on great. I love the complexity, but it¬ís lacking in some important areas to me. If this had a bit more body and a bit more aroma I would love this.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

The beer is brown and somewhat hazy, with a thin, beige collar that leaves a fair amount of lacing behind. The aroma consists of coffee beans, tobacco, smoke, roast, leather, and some mustiness. Jeff nailed it - ""This beer smells like John Wayne."" The flavor is more coffee forward than the nose would indicate, with less intricacies than were presented to the olfactory senses. The base beer is still distinguishable, and not overrun by the often dominating coffee scents. The feel is somewhat thin, with moderate carbonation. A decent brew, and quite interesting. Not my favorite coffee brew, but intriguing and worth a try.

So when the head dies down in about 10 more inures or so, I will finish the rating of this beer.  Please be patient while we wait.

------- minutes go by (literally)-----& I attempt to pour the rest of the beer into the glass, I realize that this just isn¬ít gonna happen without creating excessive amounts of head.  This beer is ridiculous.  Is it purposely carbonated this much?  Is this normal for the beer?  If so, why?  This is the most carbonated beer I have ever seen.  

Eventually, I get it all 12oz into a 16oz pint glass, but not without taking brakes every 3-4oz and letting the head die down.  The entire process of pouring the beer into a glass took like 15 minutes, I shit you not.  So now I¬ím ready to smell, taste and evaluate the beer.

Pours a deep amber-brown,  cloudy and I¬íve already described the ordeal with the head.  Aromas of coffee, but not just coffee, also toffee, caramel and some nice chocolate notes.  I¬ím getting a back room poker game, filled with hazy cigar smoke and seedy card sharks.  Nice aroma.

The taste follows suit, but not as coffee forward as I was expecting.  Smooth, roasty, but lacking something...  Don¬ít know exactly what I¬ím looking for here, but there¬ís something missing.  

Can¬ít give this beer the high rating that everyone else has... It just doesn¬ít meet the high expectations that everyone else has set for it.  Thanks Jason.","Victor, New York, USA","MacBoost"

1987,"2012-04-23",4.5,"Originally reviewed: 6/16/09. Poured from a 32oz. growler, received from the excellent trader, Kiefdog. Thanks, Kevin!

This wasn¬ít the prettiest of beers right off. Pours a more ruby-brown with about a half inch of tan head on top. Retention was zilch, and there was no lacing whatsoever. That is definitely an expendable weakness though, because this beer was stellar on all other counts. 

This smelled like freshly ground coffee, chocolate, muffins, brownies, and finished with a roasted woodsy character. Wow. I want to dip my whole face in this beer. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with just enough of a carbonation kick to let you know she¬ís fresh. Moderate amount of bubbles rising through. 

As I sip, my mouth is filled with everything I like about a good morning meal. Huge coffee presence that warms and soothes. Following this is a mild breadiness that finishes sweet and satisfying. There¬ís definite bitterness in here that is pleasant, but the sweetness and the coffee are kings. This is an excellent brown. I realize that it is limited in its release, but get some if you can.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

1987,"2012-04-16",3.3,"In short: A smooth nutty brown ale with a medium amount of fresh ground coffee.  Good
How: Bottle 12oz.  Consumed when ?? months of age.  Bottle sent by ??, thanks ??.  Ok, so this was probably an extra and I don¬ít remember where it comes from so I¬ím not entirely sure how fresh/old the bottle was
The look: Mahogany body topped by a small beige head
In long: Nose has plenty of fresh tobacco leafs, light smoky notes, caramelized walnuts, a medium amount freshly ground coffee.  Taste is soft brown whole-wheat bread, walnuts, caramel, fresh coffee, some vanilla, chewing on a cigar, whip cream.  The leafy hops do their balancing job behind the scene because the beer doesn¬ít feel sweet and there is not much bitterness.  The coffee is there no doubt, but for a beer with the word ¬ìespresso¬î in the name the coffee part is not overwhelming.  This is a decent beer but somehow the type of flavor quickly gets tiresome, with every sip I liked the beer less and less, and that was only a 12oz bottle.  I¬ím taking off points for low drinkability, a 5.5% brown ale should be more sessionnable that this.  I don¬ít know why I keep trying these CCB beers even if I don¬ít like them, nor do I know why I keep looking in the toilet when I flush even though I¬íve never seen anything exciting in there too.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1987,"2011-08-11",3.2,"This beer was courtesy of phisigben from a recent in person trade. Thanks Ben! This beer pours a medium bodied rich mahogany in color with ruby highlights and a one finger beige colored head. It looks a little lighter than I remember Maduro. It smells like Big Sound, of all things, mixed with a shot of espresso. It gives aromas of chocolate, sweet malt, cream, with a light coffee bitterness. The flavors presented are dark roasted malt with a touch of bitter coffee. The chocolate doesn¬ít come in as well as it did in the nose and the overly appealing scotch esque malt isn¬ít present either. The flavor is also short lived and not as strong as it could or should be. It drinks a little thin, and thinner than Maduro and just doesn¬ít feature the same complexity as the base beer.

Halfway through the stash of Cigar City beers I moved next to this beer. It was not quite what I expected. While not a terrible release and certainly well made it didn¬ít spark the same enthusiasm as some of the others. Even so it was a noble experiment that was ideally made.

Aroma and appearance - The inky black beer was graced by a gentle mocha head. Tendrils of light clear lacing provided evidence of the pour¬ís longevity. Fresh ground coffee beans were overpowering. Masking the other aspects I think this is what put me off the beer. It is so strong that this smells almost like a porter rather than a brown ale.

Flavor and palate - A heavy rush of espresso hits the tongue. So strong it masks everything else there is no room for the usual flavors that I associate with the style. The lingering aftertaste left a strong mark. Overall this was solid but one dimensional. I think other styles might be accented; this one is just buried by the extra ingredients.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The milder qualities of this brown ale allow the coffee to come through more than a fuller bodied stout or porter would. Cigar City has achieved that real whole bean aroma and flavor. It¬ís so well rounded, more like chewing on a chocolate covered bean than drinking a cup of brewed coffee. Palate is pretty slick and just medium weight.

Taste is sweet cocoa, some cream notes, with a small bit off coffee been being present.  Finish is slightly astringent.  Almost reminds me of a watery, sweet, cold-pressed coffee.

Like all the CCB beers I have had, this combines these flavors into a beer of peerlessly smooth texture.

This was the first Cigar City brew I ever tried, and currently shows as the #1 brown ale in the world on RateBeer.  Very dark in the bar, but when put next to a candle, it reveals brown with some red and only a thin head.  Aroma is dominated by dark earthy organic just-ground-before-brewing coffee.  Also some smoke, some dark chocolate, and some cocoa powder.  Flavor is also full of earthy coffee, but quite smooth like a little bit of milk or cream is in the coffee..perhaps some chicory coffee which reminds me of growing up in southern Louisiana.

Having had a few Cigar City brown ales, I will preemptively say that this is my least favorite - not because it¬ís a bad beer, but just because I don¬ít generally enjoy coffee beers. Pours a dark, cola-brown color; decent, light-tan head with modest retention and lacing. Lots of espresso notes and dark coffee roast in the aroma (nothing acrid, nothing particularly green), with a modest chocolaty core and some noticeable spiciness, presumably from the chicory addition. Honestly, that chicory note starts to stick out after a bit. Medium body; medium carbonation. Medium-high amounts of espresso beans, roasted coffee, and milk chocolate upfront; the spicy chicory note sits more quietly in the mouth; a very deep, delicious espresso coffee character that still melds well with the cola-like core brown ale without completely overshadowing it; the coffee addition is excellent, it just isn¬ít entirely my thing (I¬íd happily take the base beer in a heartbeat).

Pours a very dark amber brown with a 1 finger creamy light tan head. Good lacing.

Smell: Espresso with light touches of chocolate and malt. It smells like I just walked into a coffee shop. Smells delicious.

Taste: Coffee is dominant throughout, which in this case is a very good thing. There are light touches of hops and chocolate in the middle and toasted malt at the finish. Aftertaste is mildly bitter with a typical coffee aftertaste. This is like drinking iced coffee.Extremely well-balanced and delicious.

Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. You could knock back a few of these without any trouble.

The base beer is a nicely hopped brown a la Drake¬ís or something, so it was set up nicely to work with the roasted elements here. It didn¬ít disappoint, with lovely rounded whole bean aromas coming over initially and leading into a taste that was more complex, with toasted malts and some modest sweet additions seeming to come through. Not like a flavored coffee bev by any means, but a nicely complex brown that benefits from the treatment. Good stuff, guys!","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

1987,"2010-01-10",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
A bold coffee presence dominates the delicate caramel and almond flavors of the malt structure, building a very drinkable Coffee Brown Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the cloudy brown with dark amber highlights.
-The roasted coffee bean bitterness is levelled with the intensity of the rest of the flavor profile.
-The malts also have a vanilla-like fruitiness to offer.
-Carbonation was very low in this growler, but it didn¬ít affect the brew that much, to be honest. There is a lot of flavor in here.
-I think there is too much coffee presence throughout, and not enough Brown Ale. The flavors and aroma are quite linear, so one really needs to like coffee to be able to enjoy anything out of this Maduro.

1987,"2009-07-16",4.0,"32oz growler shared by kp at the Brick Store, side-by-side with the Vanilla Maduro.

Pours just like the Vanilla, with a deep copper brown and a small bubbly head that recedes quickly with no lacing.

The aroma is big on this one, dominated by used espresso grounds, almost burnt, but in a good way.  Not sure if that makes sense, but it smelled like an espresso bar.  There are some sweet dark malts underneath with hints of chocolate as well.  The coffee also seemed to bring out the tobacco aromas.

The taste was similar and was like sipping on an iced espresso.  It¬ís just full of that burnt espresso beans flavor up front, but balanced by a sweet dark malt backbone.  The nuts and tobacco are present but not nearly as dominant as in the original.

The mouthfeel, like the Vanilla Maduro, is slightly thinner and lower carbonation than I would have expected, but I really think that¬ís a product of the growler.

As a coffee lover this one hit the spot.  I¬ím definitely torn between this one and the original which I loved.  The espresso is so dominant in this one that it may take away slightly from the complexity and balance of the underlying Maduro.  That said, it¬ís still head and shoulders above most brown ales out there and astoundingly robust for the low ABV.  Another winner from CCB.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Growler:  The aroma is loaded with espresso with some light chocolate.  It pours a transparent mahogany with a large beige head that has good retention.  The flavor starts with light chocolate.  The finish has lots of espresso with some hints of vanilla and roastiness.  Light-medium bodied with soft carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
1987,"2009-06-17",3.8,"32 oz mini-growler.  Clear, but dark, copper brown with a bubbly tan head.  Espresso beans jump out with the first whiff.  Hints of oatmeal, brown sugar and pumpernickel.  Silky, medium body with dull, but prickly, carb.  Taste is burnt caramel, tobacco and espresso beans.  Dry finish with grapefruit peel.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
1987,"2009-06-14",3.9,"Huge thanks to pepsican, badbeer, and iowaherkeye, and thecheeseman. Really nice ""espresso"" aroma. Sort of like old folgers but in a good way? Coffee is nice in the finish, a bit of good hops in there too.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","ketchepillar"
1987,"2009-06-13",3.4,"Huge thanks to thecheeseman for all the ccb stuff.  Brown pour with a thin off white head.  Fresh coffee grounds and chocolate aroma.  Flavor has more coffee but it was a bit stale. Good chocolate and caramel notes.  Dry finish with good carbonation.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"
1987,"2009-06-13",3.7,"32 oz growler courtesy of Beerlando. Bryan keeps it coming like an allstar. Pours a dark brown iced tea, tranaprent, decent tan foamy head that laces well. Aromas push toasty malts, espresso and coffee, a touch of vanilla and roast, very espresso! Initial is coffee, roasted and toasted, espresso and roast with a bit of underlying sweetness. Yum. A touch of chocolate, touch of tobacco flavor really works well. This beer rock a decent body, light enough to drink a lot of but very flavorful. This seems to be the usual with CCB. I like it. Quality brew by CCB again. Finishes roast, toast, and lightly bitter. One of the best coffee infused beer I¬íve had without it getting offensive or obnoxious. Cheers!","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
1987,"2009-06-13",4.2,"Growler courtesy GodofThunder. Ruby color. Loads of coffee and chocolate in the nose on this one, luxuriant almost. Sweet balanced malt flavors, a bit nutty with a backdrop of coffee. Great coffee finish with a kiss of hops and no lack of malt backbone to finish it out.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
1987,"2009-06-10",3.9,"Sampled at the Brewery. Pours dark brown and creamy with a creamy tan head. Explosive aroma of espresso, roasted grains and hints of chocolate. Taste is thick and velvety, definitely an oatmeal influence with more roasted grains, chocolate and coffee bitterness. Such a complex and tasty beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
1987,"2009-06-09",3.9,"Growler.  Pours a dark, translucent, chestnut brown color with a small, creamy, khaki colored head.  Wet, jagged lines of lacing hold steadfast to the glass.  The aroma explodes with bold espresso notes, followed closely behind by bittersweet chocolate, dry roasted nuts, and a hint of vanilla from the oats.  It pretty much smells like a coffee lover¬ís wet dream, quite roasty, yet sufficiently balanced with subtle chocolate and burnt caramel notes.  Flavors are basically the same, smooth mocha chocolate with fresh, raw espresso bean intensity showing strong.  Toasted pecan shines again.  There¬ís a hint of lactic creaminess that seem to be perfectly placed.  The mouthfeel seems a bit thinner than the regular Maduro for some reason, but it¬ís smooth, almost silken, and incredibly drinkable.  Another damn fine session beer from Cigar City.  These guys simply don¬ít make bad beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1987,"2009-06-06",3.8,"Growler from the brewery.  Pours a nice deep brown color with a thin slightly off-white head.  Nice aroma - the aroma is distinctly espresso, but not overly bitter.  Keeping it from manhandling the base beer was a feat.   The taste displays the addition mostly on the finish, with a pleasant slight roasty-bitter character.  Very nice.","Florida, USA","JMFG"
1987,"2009-06-05",4.2,"Growler. Pours a dark amber brown. Nose is burnt coffee, sweet caramel, vanilla, roast malts. Flavor is robust but smooth and not overpowering coffee flavors, dark roast malts, some light mocha. Leaves a dry and bitter-sweet aftertaste. Full smooth mouthfeel. Gem!","Alaska, USA","gkost"
1987,"2009-06-05",4.1,"Thanks to Redlight for sharing his growler from the brewery.  Strong espresso coffee aroma.  Almost totally overpowering of the rest of the beer, this smells like a cup of coffee.  Amazing aroma!  Perfect.  Flavors are strong on the coffee with a little malt and nutty flavor and some sweetness.  The coffee bitterness comes through strong in the finish, like you just drank a cup of black coffee.  This is a great coffee beer.  Delicious.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"
1987,"2009-06-05",4.0,"growler from brewery thanks to Godofthunder and JMFG!  Strong espresso coffee aromas, caramel, creamy aroma, chocolate, it smells incredible.  Pours dark caramel brown with a thin off white head.  Rich coffee and espresso flavors upfront, with caramelly nutty malts, cafe latte, very lovely to drink!  The aroma is amazing, it finishes a little thin but the flavor is very enjoyable!","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
1987,"2009-05-30",4.1,"On tap at Datz Deli.  Poured cola brown with an off-white head.  Nose is kind of like cafe con leche (the drink, not the ccb beer).  I get enjoyable bits of coffee, nice malts, and lots of balance to this one.  The flavor is roast, some chicory, and a milky sweetness with finishing with coffee.  Not overly espresso or overly Maduro, but a balanced dance with the two.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
1987,"2009-05-28",4.0,"On tap at Datz Deli (Tampa, FL) for a CCB event. Pours a dark brown to black color with mahogany higlights and a one finger creamy off-white head that settles slowly. Aroma is sweet and roasty with notes of coffee, brown sugar, chocolate, molasses, hints of ripe dark fruit. Flavor is sweet and roasty as well with notes of chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, caramel, ripe dark fruit. Generally medium body with a pleasing roasty, coffee malt finish.","Tampa, Florida, USA","kiefdog"
1987,"2009-05-27",3.8,"Tap at Datz. Pours a slightly hazy dark brown with ruby highlights. Aroma of espresso, chocolate, and a hint of caramel. Taste is loaded with espresso, toasted malt, roast, chocolate, and more espresso. Medium thin mouthfeel with a moderate amount of bitterness from the coffee.

1987,"2009-05-27",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2010 This beer is the definition of ""hair of the dog"". I literally could swap this for my early morning coffee. Sure would make my work day more enjoyable.","Tampa, Florida, USA","sjolles85"
1987,"2009-05-27",4.3,"Draft at Datz.  Pours med to dark brown with medium white head.  Very heavy espresso nose with flavors of coffee and choc caramel.  Oatmeal flavor is lost but it definitely adds nice body.  Another delicious brew from CCB.","Tampa, Florida, USA","thejon375"
1987,"2009-05-26",3.9,"Draft at Datz.  Poured a dark reddish brown with a thin eggshell head.  Strong espresso character up front in the nose with hard roasted or burnt malt.  Flavor is first and foremost espresso with some bitter chocolate peeking through.  As it warmed the espresso took on a much more coffee ground nature.  The espresso could be turned down a wee bit in my opinion.  Very good!","Tampa, Florida, USA","HOPSHUNTER"
1987,"2009-05-26",3.9,"Poured up on tab at the 05/26/09 Datz Deli CCB tasting with a slightly hazy brown ¬ñ amber body and nice looking lasting tan head. The aroma is dark roasted coffee beans with faint roasted malts and a hint of sweetness. The taste hits first with oatmeal aided smooth notes from dark roasted coffee and roasty malts. Toward midway a brief moment of drying astringency surfaces. Midway and to the finish it gets really roasty with dark roasted coffee grounds. It ends refreshing, somewhat dry, roasty and with lingering coffee. Very nice coffee beer.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
1987,"2009-05-26",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2010 A: Pours a nice dark brown hue bordering on black. The head was a nice one finger tall with a nice mocha coloring. Pretty good retention with a nice smattering of lace.

S: Wow the coffee aroma is out of this world good. Tons of rich fresh dark roasted coffee backed by nice tones of bitter chocolate. Hints of roasted malt with more and more coffee... er espresso.

T: Tons of perfectly toasted malt. Nutty chocolate that quickly yields to the best iced coffee known to man. The middle and end is coffee, coffee, and more coffee with a dollop of chocolate for good measure.

M: On the lighter side of medium. Nice cling for full enjoyment.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
