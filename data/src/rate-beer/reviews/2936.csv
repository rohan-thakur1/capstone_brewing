2936,"2016-12-18",4.0,"This is a very good cider for me. Its a wetter cider than most and the balance of sweet sugars and tart apples.","Holland, Michigan, USA","Hopper8"
2936,"2014-12-22",3.9,"(bottle - 750 ml) Gold pour with a soapy white head. Tart apple aroma with light spice, honey and a definite hint of the barrels. A mild touch of hops too. Sweet apples and honey at the start of the taste with a light funky and dry note and some decent spice coming up into the end. Finishes with a light sweetness from the barrel. Different but rather nice.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"
2936,"2014-06-17",3.4,"starts off clear, with immediately noticeable barrel notes in the nose, with fairly muted apple skin. Theres some suggestion of sweetness here, not a lot of complexity, though more likely covered up. Occasional floral honey notes, though more often just ""sweet""
less sweetness than one would expect given the aroma, and I think thats great. the off-dry flavor is a little more complex, but quickly covered up by the barrel. Just not balanced between the two. Otherwise theres little to complain about here. Well done; would just like to see a larger cider component and less barrel dominance.","Kansas, USA","udubdawg"
2936,"2014-05-15",3.3,"Bottle from Mike - thanks! Clear golden pour with no head. Apple, tart, and some herbal bitterness in the aroma. Taste is green apple and tart with light funk and bitterness. Low carbonation. Pretty nice.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"
2936,"2014-05-11",3.5,"Bottle from umich03jm. Really interesting idea with this cider. Pours a fairly typical cider color, with a light aroma with interesting notes mixed in there. Flavor is semi-sweet cider, earthy funk and wood in the background. Very balanced but stays interesting. A pretty refined cider. Nice to drink although I was hoping for more complexity based on the way they did this.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"
2936,"2014-04-25",3.9,"Bottle: The aroma consists of sour apples, vanilla, honey, light spice, and a touch of oak. It pours a transparent dark good with a small white head that quickly fades to a thin ring around the edges of the glass. The flavor starts with moderate sweet and tart apples with some faint honey. The finish has light-moderate lemon, white wine, light brett, must, oak, and vanilla. It?s medium bodied with mild carbonation. Overall, real tasty and dangerously drinkable at 8.5%.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

Taste starts with tart apples and vanilla then finishes with sour lemons and a hint of barnyard. Light on the tongue with a very soft bubbly carbonation.

2936,"2014-02-21",4.6,"Smells like honey and apples with a slight sweated soaked spring morning thing going on. Clear gold color and slightly fizzy palate. The flavor reminds me of a granny smith apple pie. An odd very enjoyable cider.","Illinois, USA","jayzz"

2936,"2014-01-25",4.3,"First, most people on here are making comments about it being sour. Of course...it has Brettanomyces culture in it, which will make it sour. One of the best ciders/cysers Ive had.","Illinois, USA","LostArkitekt"

2936,"2014-01-17",3.6,"Shared 750 ml. bottle, with my portion poured to a Duvel tulip, showing a clear & bright, golden color, with a thin, bubbly ring around the perimeter of the liquid, and leggy spots on the glass. The nose was fruity, funky & musty, with a slight but fleeting hint of betadine on the edge. Light bodied, the taste initially presented just the right amount subtle sweetness, then apple, moderate tartness, mellow alcohol, and finishing dryness. Tasty, crisp, and palate pleasing.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
