1506,"2012-03-06",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 7/20/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

With a reasonably aggressive pour, a billowing eggshell head forms on top of a hazy light yellow beer. Although the head subsides somewhat, it leaves some nice lace on the glass.

Crackd Wheat has a strong, balanced aroma. Lots of banana here, but it is not overpowering, which for me is key in enjoying a Hefe. Some tropical fruits swirl up as well.

Up front there is a honey-like sweetness with a firm banana flavor. The wheat is apparent, and the cloves come in with the rest of the yeasts spicy flavor. Some pineapple and orange citrus work to mellow out the banana, which really helps to keep it out of the overly sweet category. A touch of alcohol steps in right at the end, not a pleasant flavor in a beer of this ABV, and the one real knock I have against the flavor.

As would be expected, the body is light to medium, with a fizzy, bubbly creaminess that almost gets into the excellent category. After each sip there is a light residual stickiness and oiliness (maybe from the hops?) left on my lips. Toward the end of the sip the feel dries out a little bit after starting fairly sweet.

I was a little bit surprised by this - I was not expecting a subtle, balanced Hefe when I bought this, but that is what I got.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Pours a very hazy moderate golden orange color with a nice white head.

1506,"2011-02-13",3.9,"A local specialty. Ive heard hype both in state and on this site for this one. Comes in a plain looking 12 ounce bottle with a statement about the brew contained within. The abv seems a bit high for a true Hefeweizen and on the label it says a cross between a Hefe and APA.

After a nice pour into my weizen glass it appears very much like a Hefeweizen. Nice hazy orange/gold color with a billowing foamy white head that forms a mountain of foam on top.

With the smell this one starts to get its own identity. There is indeed that classic hefe smell with a nice dose of clove but underneath it the little surprise hits you: hops, and lots of them, after awhile it seems they take over. The only other beer that Ive smelt like this is the Scnheider-Brooklyner Hopfen-Wiesse.

Taste is where this one pretty much throws the Hefe theme out the window. It has a smooth, mellow banana/fruit beginning but then quickly the palate is attacked with a decent sized load of spicy, citrusy hops. Mild yeast in there too. It finishes with some clove and spice. Too much hops to be called a Hefeweizen. Id consider it a hopfen-weiß, much in the style of the SBHW.

1506,"2010-12-12",4.2,"Appearance: unfiltered haze reveals layers of orange and straw. Fluffy head resembles meringue, fading in chunky clumps which cling to the sides of my glass as lil globules.

Nose: spicy. Oozes cracked wheat, spice, and dried fruits such as peaches and apricots. Nectarine and tangerine skins eek oily esters while pith and straw hover in the back. Touch stewed; boozy wood.

Palate: lovely tint of tartness atop tongue takes me by surprise in all sorts of good ways. Whole wheat loaves, breads, rolls abound; biting through their seed crusted crust explodes with spice, pepper, and nutty earthiness. Chewy mouthfeel further intensifies the whole cracked bready experience. Bright orange zest in the back; mingles with spice for some stewed orange and nectarine peel. Pith, wheat, and a tickle of sour linger after each quaff. Lovely.

Final Thoughts: this is the perfect wheat beer for those who profess to not like wheat beers. In general I like all beers (with a few exceptions) so this particular offering from New Glarus was especially delightful for it took even me by surprise by how much she lived up to her name.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

12 oz. bottle

Ar: Big citrus/cinnamon/clove nose, as advertised.  Lemony hops as well.
Ap: Poured into a sampler glass with a nice 3/4"" head of tightly knit bubbles.  Somewhat cloudy, though a bit more translucent than other NG wheats.
T: Clove and cinnamon dominate the flavor of this beer.  Lovely spice.  The lemony hops that leave a slight bitterness on the finish are a really nice touch.

S-One of the main characters in the nose is floral hops. Some clove as well as a hint of banana and sweet bready yeast can also be detected.

T- Upfront is a hint of banana with a hint of clove thrown in and a floral hop accent. The floral hops really come through for the finish and are refreshing a hint of clove and sweet bready yeast come through in the background. What is left to linger on the palate is a mild floral hop bitterness.

P- Low to medium carbonation and light smooth, yeasty body.

O- This is a very good, and interesting brew. I like the floral hop accent on a hefe weizen-it almost gives it a character similar to a much lighter, somewhat hoppy, Belgian Tripel. I got this both as SNF winnings and in a trade and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. I would love to have it again and would be all over it if it were my local brew.

Flavor of banana bread, Amarillo hops, clove, wheat, lemon citrus, yeast, and a bit of a metallic note.  Medium-bodied, wheaty, and low carbonation.  Dry, wheaty finish.  Fruity, sweet, and wheaty.

1506,"2010-03-25",3.8,"12 oz bottle. Now this wheat from New Glarus is actually something to write home about. I suppose thats only if you can call this a wheat. Really this is a solid combination that turned out quite well. A very aromatic beer. Nice florals and minor citrus fruits along with banana bread, mixed spices, and pale grains. It looks pretty what youd expect from a hefe though with a hazy golden orange body, and decent sized creamy white head. I suppose this one really tastes as it sounds. Some good citrus, pale grains, and minor caramel at one end. Then light spices, banana, and yeasty wheat on the other end. This all combines quite well and finish with a cinnamon spicy herbal and earth. This was very tasty.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"

1506,"2010-02-15",3.6,"In short: A very tasty and sharp German Hefeweizen style beer.  Very good.
How: Bottle 12oz.  Exact age unknown but consumed a few days after receiving it from Brewolf.  Thanks a ton Michael.
The look: Cloudy yellow body topped by a medium white head
In long: Intense lemony-hefe nose.  Taste is crisp and sharp.  Lots of crisp hay, a bit of honey, dried bananas, lemon skin, bubblegum, light clove notes.  Very active carbonation with lots of very small bubbles.  Full body.  The finish is very tart and with a short sharp bitterness, intense enough to make it one to down slowly.  Classified as a generic Wheat Ale but I thought that the beer had a strong German Hefeweizen yeast signature.  Very much above average for the style.

1506,"2010-01-15",4.6,"12oz bottle, courtesy of MatSciGuy. Thanks, Levi!! Pours a beautiful, hazy orange-lemon color; enormous foam white head with great retention and lacing; absolutely beautiful pour. What wheat beer from Dan Carey hasnt been gorgeous? Honestly Im really surprised this is listed as a wheat ale when there are a ton of esters playing out here: bubble gum, bananas, cloves and just hints of mineral and citrus bitterness; nothing overly sweet, everything well-handled and integrated; generous notes of bubble gum but without any real residual sugars here; this is all yeast work; excellent aroma. Medium mouthfeel: lively, creamy carbonation; following the nose, lots of bubble gum esters here, ahead of secondary traditional German notes of bananas and cloves; nicely dried out without being entirely stripped of its juicy, ester-focused center; a light forward wheatiness, perfect levels of acidity, mouthwatering, a nice mineral and citrus hop character at the perimeter; I bet this was even more stunning when it came out, when the hop character was dead-on. In my mind, the best wheat beers in the world arent coming out of Germany. Generous, perfectly drinkable, everything one could ask for in a beer. Lasting finish: bubble gum and bananas persist, along with a lovely, lasting mineral bitterness; nicely dry. Its consistently an honor to drink this mans beer.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

A brisk, burgeoning flavor of all the right characters of wheat; strong and delicate at the same time, with brightest tastes of lemon, banana and tarragon.  Beneath the high notes is a tight, crisp surface of crackery wheat flavor, clean and dry; altogether the thing is fantastically, perfectly simple like this kind of thing plainly ought to be.

The taste is citrusy Amarillo, moderate banana (actually more like banana bread with the general spiciness of the beer), clove and vanilla.

5/26/2009:  New Glarus Crackd Wheat pours a wonderful cloudy orange color (opaque, really) with a persistent off-white head.  The aroma is both sweet and spicy which are evident of the pleasing, toffee/wheat maltiness and the corriander-like spice.  There is also a considerable amount of orangy-citrus that can be attributed Amarillo dry hopping.  The flavor is a unique blend between a pale ale and German wheat beer.  The banana and clove undertones fight with the wheaty, heavish pale ale characteristics.  This beer has a heavier body than expected, but still quite refreshing on a hot and humid Spring day.  Overall this is okay, but wasnt what I expected and not nearly as good as Dancing Man which is my benchmark New Glarus wheat beer.  Maybe this beer will grow on me after I try another one or two...

8/08/2009:  I like New Glarus Crackd Wheat much better after it has had a couple few months to settle down and meld a bit.  I also like a slightly more than their Unplugged Imperial Weizen...  Aroma:  Clove and some hefe-like wheat with lemon and a hint of tangerine.  Appearance:  Bright golden color, cloudy; lofty white head of thick foam that lasts forever and leaves puffy lacing marks.  Flavor:  Really nice marriage of a hefe and pale ale with penty of characteristics of each coming through:  creamy, yeasty, spicy (clove), lemon, and hints of banana from the hefe; moderate bitterness and sweeter citrus notes from the pale ale and dry hopping.  Palate:  Overall:  Well done!  This is a very flavorful yet moderately light and heavily refreshing beer!  Grows on me more and more with each gulp!

1506,"2009-06-19",4.1,"So I am getting to rate this, I have had a few from this recent batch and every time I drink it I find it beautifully crafted.  First off it pours with a thick, voluptuous head, just so strong and full of character.  The color of the beer is a radiant thick golden.  Its hazy but never gets full or muddy, even with the final pour out of the bottle. The head fades, not too fast and not too slow.  Aroma is thick banana esters.  There is a nice character behind it, if you could imagine a dark yet white sweet bread maltiness.  It works beautifully. There is a sweet poppy wheatiness all around as well.  What the hell is a wheatiness, well, you know.  The flavor is a bit sweeter and thinner esters coming through. It still works very well, especially for a thick and hardy-like hefe.  I really dont see this as an American Wheat, there might a bit of a more American hoppiness at the very end of the flavor but in general the beer is completely taken over by the yeast (I also used this yeast for a homebrew and the yeast really takes over).  It has a nicely thicker mouthfeel that feels smooth and welcoming on the cheeks.  An estery banana aftertaste lasts for a while.

Pours a lovely golden color with little to no head (as opposed to the ""thick creamy"" head promised on the bottle). Aroma contains notes of citrus and cloves, hops, etc. Flavor is very complex, with a hint of hefeweizen with the IPA in the background, waiting for the finish.

Another top notch release from New Glarus I will have to get a sixer of this before it fades into the backlog of releases next year.  If you live anywhere near Wisconsin rush to the borders the first chance you get and pick some up.  Not only a great beer it is priced at a great point.

Aroma / Appearance - The fast fading head yields to a cloudy golden body.  Banana nut bread, white toast, and fruity aspects give it a strong kick.  Clear and simple I like the way it comes across.

Flavor / Palate - Honey wheat Cheerios start the parade along with light fruity hints.  Everything comes together into a yeasty wrapup.  I would certainly prefer this over some of the local breweries but who wouldnt like to have access to New Glarus year round?","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1506,"2009-05-20",3.2,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Pours a pale, banana gold color, mostly hazy, with a thick layer of well sustaining, pillowy white foam.  Interesting and appealing aroma of lemony hops and tart wheat combine with a huge dose of creamy banana fruity esters.  The ester profile on this beer is especially amazing.  Light bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel with a dry, wheaty acidic finish.  The banana esters get kind of blasted out of the flavor profile by the assertiveness of the lemon citrus hops, creating a bit of a harshness in the flavor.  Nice and dry, with a moderate tartness from the wheat.  As I found the ester profile to be the most appealing aspect of the aroma, I find the flavors to be disappointing, as the hops completely dominate any of the other flavor components, and even contribute a harsh, uric flavor.  Toward the finish, I find some more of the yeast characters lingering, leaving a pleasant clove and banana flavor on my tongue.  Somewhat disjointed, but it sure has some beautiful aspects.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

1506,"2009-05-16",3.7,"Sampled April 2009
As I pour aromas of banana and tart wheat are noticeable.  A careful pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip easily produces a four-finger thick, pale tan colored head.  The beer is a hazy, orange-gold color that still shows an opaqueness even when held up directly to the light.  Hoppy notes are immediately noticed as soon as I start to inspect the nose; notes of tangerine and tropical fruit notes meld interestingly with more traditional Hefeweizen like aromatics.  I wouldnt have guessed that these would meld so seamlessly but the hop and Hefe notes do.  Fermentation driven notes of clove, and perhaps a touch of banana are here as well as a solid, grassy grain character.  Both combine to produce a bubblegum like note that makes me think of citrus scented juicy-fruit.

The beer is dry, which subdues the fruity hop notes a bit.  The finish is a mix of tropical fruit notes, banana and spicy clove; the last of which lingers on the tongue with a signature phenolic note.  This has a soft tartness to it in the finish as well as a touch of pale malt toastiness and perhaps a touch of grassy grain.  This has a certain bitterness to it that takes a while for me to notice; it seems to affect the outside edges of my palate somehow, rather than having that clean, biting bitterness that one might normally notice.  This is nice and quaffable, the touch of tartness helps this along, and I like that this is pretty light, but still has a touch of palate heft.  The traditional Hefe-yeast (that looks a bit weird) produces a really nice spiciness here that mixes with the more herbal notes from the hops.

This beer has an expressive aromatic amalgam of notes that dont entirely transfer to the flavor.  This is a very nice beer all around though, but I wish that the flavor had the liveliness that the aroma did.  This beer is down right drinkable as it disappears way too quickly; I could of used at least another 12oz of this beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The aroma is nice and shows wheat, clove, banana, cinnamon, to go with some citrus and floral hops. The flavor follows with the fresh wheat, sweet cinnamon and clove spices, to go along with the bitterness of the citrus and floral hops. Newly ripened bananas add to the fruity flavor provide just enough sweetness. Medium bodied with a lot of carbonation that leads to a dry, bitter finish. Maybe a touch too much carbonation.

1506,"2009-05-01",3.8,"I thought quite highly of this as a wheat beer, as I thought it had a lot of really good German hefeweisse flavor (more like a Franziskaner than an insipid American Wheat beer).  There are some brewers that do a really poor job emulating European, particularly German, styles (Im talking about you Sprecher), but I thought this beer was a great recreation of a good European hefe...with the slightly viscous,  hazy, straw colored body, big white fluffy head, or tasty spiciness.  But I didnt get the American Pale Ale-ness of this beer.  Quite solid, but a bit of a miss according to the brewers description.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

Poured a cloudy yellow color with a thick, rocky white head that slowly receded to a bubbly layer and left some spotty lacing.  Aroma of citrus (orange, tangerine), banana, clove, a light doughy yeast, and some light flowery hops.  Crisp, moderately dry entry with a moderate hoppiness and undertones of  citrus (light lemon, orange, faint grapefruit) transitioning into a moderate yeastiness with hints of wheat, banana and clove that finishes with a soft doughiness and a light undertone of citrus.  Moderate carbonation and a full, but crisp mouthfeel making the beer easy to drink.  Certainly a different example of the wheat style, but it manages to combine the freshing qualities of a German wheat with the crispness of Amarillo hops.  Pretty good.

The taste follows the aroma with a bit more citrus hops than the aroma.  The lemony hops up front give way to the massive yeasty sweetness with the bananas coming through.  The finish is a mix of clove spiciness and a bit of the citrus hops.

Lightly sweet, honey kissed grains are softly infused with balancing floral and citrus hops.  Flavors follow along perfectly, overflowing with fresh, clean, honey glazed wheat grains that provide a fantastic backdrop for bold cinnamon and clove spices, as well as bitter citrus peel and floral hops.

1506,"2009-02-20",4.4,"(bottle) Pours a hazy light gold with a large, fluffy white head that leaves good lacing.  A really great aroma of citrus, orange zest, grapefruit, lemon, with sweeter undertones of banana, bubblegum, and sweet bread that waxes and wanes upon every sniff.  There is also an herbal and spice component in the aroma, with scents of mint, cinnamon, and clove.  Theres also a hint of new car smell.  This is an incredibly complex aroma, sometimes the citrus dominates, other times the sweeter smells, and finally the herbs and spice.  Very nice.  The taste starts out significantly sweet with plenty of banana, and maintains this sweetness for awhile, turns a bit drier and bread-like before the finish, then upon the finish the hops kick in and combine with the previous flavors.  There is also that great twang of wheat, that creates a subtle mustard-like flavor towards the finish.  Pineapple is present too.  Fresh mint, clove, and cinnamon also appear right before the finish, which becomes pleasantly bitter.  Mouthfeel is definitely not as chewy and full as the Imperial Weizen, but this is to be expected for a more sessionable beer, and yes, I imagine Ill be drinking more of this marvelous beer throughout the year.

[rerate] after nearly polishing off a six pack Ive decided I really enjoy this as a go-to beer, despite my initial skepticism.   The hops have faded the perfect amount to be a really well rounded and super flavorful wheat beer.  I think that helped a lot as the hops were so strong at first overpowering any nuances the wheat brought to the table.  Sooo much better after a few weeks of mellowing...Im on board with this one now.

1506,"2009-02-13",4.0,"thanks to my bro for hooking this up.  Aroma is of intense yeast, spice, banana, clove, and hops.  Taste is ripe banana, yeast, clove, and citrus hops.  Highly carbonated and intense aroma, this is a great beer.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"
1506,"2009-02-13",4.0,"Call me crazy, but this beer is eerily reminiscent of the Copper Kettle Weiss- i dont know. Pours a vibrant but cloudy golden colour with a noticeably hue toward the top. No matter how you pour it, a creamy white top dominates this beer, leaving behind a crazy sticky layered mess that resembles something like the layers of a cake.Froth is like Cool W-hip (Think Family Guy). On the nose, aroma is dominated by bananna, clove, green pepper and ginger. Clove is upfront and in your face. Tastes are pleasent and tropical, but finishes tart- something close to taking a tiny bite out of an orange peel. Mellow all the way through, this is already reminding me of summer- review number 1600!","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","phishpond417"
1506,"2009-02-09",4.2,"Picked up a sixer from Steves Liquor and More in Madison, WI. Pours a semi-hazy golden orange brew with a thick and lumpy white head that has excellent retention and thick lacing. Aroma of banana esters, cloves, some floral hops, and a touch of perfume. Taste is medium bodied, flavors of golden grain, vanilla, banana esters, some floral hops, orange zest and a touch of lemon. Finish is semi-sweet with a nice banana and orange aftertaste. Awesome!","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1506,"2009-02-08",4.1,"Bottled.  Poured ever-so-slightly hazy lighter orange with a creamy, never-ending white head.  The aroma picked up soft, sweeter banana and bready malts with substantial floral and grassy hoppage.. clovey wheat presence prickled the back of the nostrils.  The flavor found primarily banana sweetness again at the core with a whole lot of floral and citrusy bitterness around.. spices were lively with white pepper and cloves rockin it.  About medium-bodied with creamy carbonation on the palate and plenty of bitterness and spices around.. very well balanced and engaging throughout.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1506,"2009-02-08",4.0,"An amazing fresh clean banana, and clove aroma,maybe the best of this kind I ever experienced. Couldnt quite fish out a lot of that Amarillo dry hopping,not like the Imperial Weizen had. Taste was that of a highly charged weizen, very full and satisfying, almost tart lemony banana a touch hot from the cinnamon,drying out nicely at the end,with a little bittering in the finish. Almost a carbonic bite noticable as you go along,odd time of year for the release of a brew that is so thirst quenching. Another well done wheat from the guy who seems to own this style","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"
1506,"2009-02-07",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2009 Pours a hazy gold with an enormous pile of white lace.  12 oz of beer fills up my 22 oz wheat glass, leaves ring after ring of lace, and when Im done, theres still a pile of suds in the bottom.  Big banana-based aroma, rounded out by citrus and clove.  The flavor has the banana fruitiness perfectly harmonized with the worty and vanilla elements of cooked cereals.  Sweet at first, getting a little husky on the finish.  Thick bodied, very smooth on the palate.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","noncaloric"
1506,"2009-02-06",4.1,"Beautiful stuff - slightly hazy straw body under a rocky long-lasting head.  Upon the first sip I knew New Glarus has another wheat-winner!  This guy is dry and spicy up front with a pleasant wheat malt in back to balance it out.  Complimenting the finish is good hop flavor (i.e. not bitterness).","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
1506,"2009-02-06",4.0,"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a huge pillowy white head that fades slowly leaving plenty of sticky lacing.  Aroma is orange zest, bubble gum, and pear.  Taste is like a sessionable Imperial Weizen.  Up front you have the clove and spiciness but then it fades into a smooth APA, with a decent malt backbone and some citric hops.  I cant wait to take one of these down after mowing the lawn......now I just need a lawn to mow!","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Petrucci914"
1506,"2009-02-06",4.2,"Hazed dark straw color. Big, lasting head of off-white bubbles. Spicy hops and yeast aromas. Thats interesting, the head gets whiter the longer it sets, now a rocky volcano with nice lace. Heavy scents of cloves, mingle with orange zest. Underneath is a big share of wheat and pale malt. Spicy from the start as there is a cinnamon and citric bite on the tongue. Great wheat and malt backdrop. Amarillo hops are quite evident. Actually quite dry in the finish with some dry spice qualities. Another winner weiss from Dan and New Glarus. Cant wait to put this one on tap for the summer. After paying $15+ for a bomber of Oatgoop. this is a steal at $7 per six pack.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
