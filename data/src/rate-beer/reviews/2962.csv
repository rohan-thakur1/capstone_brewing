2962,"2017-05-26",2.9,"Tallboy can via trade. Awesome name and can. Poured a thick syrupy rusty orange with large clinging bubbles and a foamy white head. Aroma/flavor of alcohol, caramel malts, grains, more alcohol, sweet wort, alcohol, touch of corn cob and finishes with you guessed it more alcohol. Big hot messy body.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
2962,"2017-05-24",3.4,"Can, thanks to Dr.Fabulous. Pours clear amber with small frothy beige head, malt aroma, low carbonation, medium bitter caramel malt taste with alcohol undertones, smooth body, long medium bitter malty finish. Quite a smooth barley wine.","New York, TURKEY","trapped"

2962,"2017-05-13",3.5,"16 ounce can. Lots of carbonation. Lots of malt in this malt liquor. Caramel and some hops.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
2962,"2017-05-09",3.5,"Bottle. Somewhat cloudy medium to dark amber body, thin cream head. Nose of candy corn, caramel, and booze. Sweet body, loads of caramel, candies, and perhaps grapes, with leafy bitter hops lending bitterness to the otherwise sweet toffee finish. Drinks more like a heavy bock than a standard malt liquor. Im not sure I was supposed to like this but Im pleasantly surprised.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
2962,"2017-05-08",3.3,"12 ounce bottle from Total Wine Brookfield. Dark copper, thin head, poor retention. Aroma of toasted malt, raisin, booze. The taste is toffee, caramel, booze. Medium bodied, hot. More strong ale than malt liquor.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
2962,"2017-05-06",3.3,"Pours a brown color without much of a foam head. Aroma is caramel and toffee malts with some earthy hops. Flavor is sweet caramel, toffee, and biscuit, a little bit earthy. Lightly bitter. Has some carbonation and a thick body. Not bad.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","chucklemation"
2962,"2017-04-30",3.5,"Tap at Clubhouse BFD. Pours sort of opaque orange, white head. Aroma is caramel, hops, malt, little orange, surprisingly solid nose. Flavor is bitter and boozy, caramel, orange. Good for malt liquor.","New York, USA","SG111"
2962,"2017-04-13",2.8,"Bottle from Beers of the World. Lots of caramel malt with little hop balance.","","ehaak26"
2962,"2017-04-13",3.0,"Tap at Gingerman. Deep orange pour. Nose is caramel and rubbing alcohol. Tastes first of sharp alcohol. Then you get caramel, toasted malt, hint of white pepper and dates. Hot and slick palate.","New York, USA","Jow"

2962,"2017-03-11",3.1,"16oz can pours a clear, dark orange with some lacing, white head. Looks like a good DIPA. Nose is malt liquor for real, corn, butterscotch, orange, heavy honey comb. Flavor has booze, butterscotch, caramel, orange peel, some soap, caramelized corn, treacle. Full bodied, bitter on the finish, lightly boozy. The bitterness saves this and makes it something drinkable. Almost drinks like a DIPA thats been in the cellar too long.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
2962,"2017-02-26",3.5,"Draft. Pours amber. Aroma is noble hops and crisp maltiness. This is a good IPL, a malt liquor, not so much.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
2962,"2017-02-25",2.7,"Pour out of 16 oz can, dark orange pour with white head, aroma brought notes of grain, corn, some booze, slight fruity and slight grassy notes. Taste was a mix of grass, bread, some corn into booze, slight fruit, finishing boozy. As far as malt liquors go it isnt bad, it isnt good, but itll get ya drunk.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
2962,"2017-02-19",2.8,"12oz bottle (9.5%). Pours an orange tinted amber with a modest white head. Malty macro aroma. Sweet malts followed by bitter hops and alcohol. Some fruit. Not at all enjoyable for me. Wont finish this one....","Michigan, USA","Mr_Abner"
2962,"2017-02-19",3.3,"16 oz. can. Loud pour with clearly audible carbonation and an aroma that is somewhat fruity with hints of burnt sugar. The beer has a clear amber colour, an ecru head, and good lace. It has a smooth malty start with notes of fruit and alcohol warmth expanding into the middle. The long finish has hints of hop dryness and and a faint metallic note. A pleasant warm alcohol glow at the very end. Good mouthfeel throughout.","Dunbar, Ontario, CANADA","n1940"
2962,"2017-01-23",3.6,"16 ounce can into tulip glass; no can dating, but is a recent release. Pours slightly hazy medium orange/amber/light copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, grapefruit, melon, pear, apple, citrus peel, pepper, pine, cracker, corn, biscuit, honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of citrus/earthy hops, moderate bready malt sweetness, and light fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste big lemon, grapefruit, melon, pear, apple, citrus peel, pepper, pine, cracker, corn, biscuit, honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate pine/citrus rind/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, grapefruit, melon, pear, apple, citrus rind, pepper, pine, cracker, corn, biscuit, honey, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Nice robustness and balance of citrus/earthy hops, moderate bready malt sweetness, and light fruity yeast flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from lingering bitterness, increasing through the glass. Bit of increasing lingering hop astringency, but not overwhelming. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/grainy/sticky/resinous, and slightly slick balanced mouthfeel that is good. Fairly clean on lager flavors; a bit of DMS and fruity yeast notes, but not overwhelming. Alcohol is very well hidden, a mild lingering warmth after the finish. Overall this is a pretty nice hoppy malt liquor. All around good robustness and balance of citrus/earthy hops, moderate bready malt sweetness, and light fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drink for the big ABV. This was nicely enjoyable; but really just tastes like a DIPL with a lot of grainy/maize flavors, and not a true malt liquor.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
2962,"2017-01-19",2.6,"Bought since I wanted to check malt liquor. Oh man this is tough.... Aroma is like a sweaty macro lager.

looks good. Darker amber. Idk. 

Taste is tough. Alcohol is decently well hidden but yikes its light. Like a slight floral character.

Palate is light. tough. 

Overall this is great after a rough day at work. Ja ja just what I needed.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Jamesthebrit"
2962,"2016-12-31",3.5,"I bought a 4-pack of pint cans on a whim. Im not a malt liquor fan, only because I havent seen any craft off risings in the style. When I hear ""malt liquor"" my taste bud memories go back 40 years to experience with Colt .45 Malt Liquor. I approached the Hobo with an open mind, not expecting more than a high ABV beer that would give me a buzz, but not much else. 

I got surprised. No, this is not a beer to compare to other styles, but it intrigues me. Ill keep my eye open for others in the style. It pours a shiny, ruby with long lasting head. The ABV is dominant, which I guess is a character for the style. It does have more character though. A fruity nose and fruity corn, if you can imagine it. Really enjoy it about halfway through the pint. . . Maybe the booze is going to my head. 

Anyway, not bad. Ill buy another 4-pack.","Lansing, Michigan, USA","blackflag321"
2962,"2016-12-30",2.9,"On draft a the brewery. The pour is a darker copper orange with a thin ring of egg shell colored head and a spot or two of lace. The aroma is very grainy and sweet up front. There is a light fruitiness and a hint of some caramel malts. The flavor is interesting. There is a sharp alcohol up front, before it rolls into a sweet metallic malt that lets you know this is for sure a malt liquor. The mouth feel is thin and slick with a softer carbonation and a syrupy feel. The aftertaste is lingeringly sweet and metallic with a hint of fruit. This isnt my jam, at all.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
2962,"2016-12-23",3.1,"Aroma is strangely fruity, fake berries, corn, earthy hops, smells like a fruity malt liquor, alright. Appearance is amber, clear, light brown head. Taste is fruity, corn, metallic, booze, earthy hops, cereal, strange, very strange. Mouthfeel is medium body, light carbonation, weird bitter fruity aftertaste. Overall, malt liquor is malt liquor. This one is good for what it is.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
