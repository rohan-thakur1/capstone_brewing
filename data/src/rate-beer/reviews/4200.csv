4200,"2017-01-28",3.4,"Keg @ Bull Falls. Deep chestnut pour with a small head. Nose is toasty, bright. Rich malt. A bit of dark fruits. Flavor has sweet, earthy malt character. Full bodied, a bit boozy.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
4200,"2016-08-13",3.4,"16 ounce can from Trigs in Wausau, drunk sometime between July 29th and 31st at my family reunion in Three Lakes, WI, from the can. OK I poured a little bit in my hand to make sure that it was, indeed, ""bock colored"". At least I think I did. I dont know, between the heat and running around after my nieces to make sure they didnt drown and trying to find a tiny bit of alone time the family reunion is already a bit of a blur, and I didnt take reliable notes on any of the many beers I tried. But these Bull Falls samples really did stand out, mostly because they were a lot better than I expected. This had a lovely - very typical - caramelized malt nose, maybe some brown sugar and smoke, even through the hole in the can...it was nicely balanced between those sweet malts and a little bit of burnt/charred bitterness, though certainly slanted more to the sweet side...carbonation level low but reasonable...perhaps just a bit on the thin side, but overall a solid bock and easy to drink outdoors in the summer heat.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
4200,"2016-06-23",3.5,"Can - Cola color with ruby highlights. Nose is sweet with a little raisin and medium toasted sweet bread. A little bit of roast and nuttiness. Taste is the same with a little less roast and nuttiness. Its mellow and bready, with a touch of bitterness and herbal hopping on the finish. Pretty solid...one of the better Bull Falls Ive had.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
4200,"2015-08-14",3.7,"Beer pours a rich mahogany color with small head and some lacing. Deep rich chocolate on the nose with an earthiness, and hop scent as well. Beer is rich velvet smooth bordering on oily with a lingering hop aftertaste. Taste has notes of chocolate, with a hop finish.","Wisconsin, USA","GuenSmith"
4200,"2015-06-19",3.5,"Dark chestnut color with a moderate sized tan head. Aromas of toasted to lightly roasted malt, some caramel and mild dry herbs. Full feel. Heavier bock presents. Dark malts, and a bit of wintergreen hops. Strong dark caramel. Quite smooth. The malt lacks some richness and depth for what I am looking for in a great bock, but still a good bock.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
4200,"2015-06-18",3.0,"Sampled from a can at the St. Paul Summer Beer Fest. Pours a deep amber with a yellowish brown head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has notes of bread, sweet grains and a bit of caramel. Flavor has notes of lager yeast, bread, sweet grains and a touch of toffee.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
4200,"2015-05-18",3.3,"Taste was way better than expected...cola colored...smooth and refreshing....really nice stuff...(#481)","Minnesota, USA","johnnymusky"
4200,"2015-02-15",3.7,"473ml can. It is a sweet but not too sweet bock, crisp hoppy finish, not too much maillard reaction type soy flavors some bocks out of WI get. One of the more German-like and better WI bocks.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
4200,"2014-11-08",3.8,"16 oz can poured into red solo cup for the short notice share with Justin and Morgan in FL. Brown body with creamy tan head that sticks, even to the plastic cup. Super malty aroma with notes of cocoa, roast, a little smoke, and bread. Taste is sweet - roasted malt with chocolate, plus a touch of leafy hop bitterness and alcohol on the swallow. Medium body, creamy and slightly oily texture, average carbonation, a pleasant touch bitterness on the finish.","","sitzds"
4200,"2014-08-13",3.7,"Dark caramel brown pour with a nice tan head. Big malty nose, big malty taste with a hint of booze.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
4200,"2014-06-24",3.8,"Clear dark red with no head. Caramel is dominant and reminds me a little of a scotch ale. Chocolate and spicy notes from roasted grain in the aroma and middle. Minimal hop presence, maybe some spice. Clean sweet finish. Not a style I usually go for, but a very nice beer. The chocolate and spice do it for me.","","hopbag"
4200,"2014-06-08",3.6,"16 oz. can thanks to Skyview for the opportunity. Dark born with some crimson around the edges. Lasting head retention. Aroma is light chocolate, roasted nuts and hints of a fruity hop. 
Flavor is much the same as the aroma with a light lager yeast in the main body. Roasted nuts, hints of chocolate and toasted grain. Hints of cola and caramel. Body is perfect for the style, solid medium and easy to drink a large amount of. Finish has a mild lingering roasted grain note. I killed the 16 oz. very easily. Damn nice lager!","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
4200,"2014-04-10",3.4,"[Tap] Part of a sampler at the brewery. Clear and bright orange in color. Not much head to speak of, but nice lacing is evident in the glass. Toasted bread and light alcohol in the nose. Toffee, grassy hops, hints of alcohol and sweet grain in the flavor. Better mouthfeel than expected after trying their other beers. This is a pretty good one.","Illinois, USA","troyc"
4200,"2011-01-05",5.0,"A fantastic bock beer, its a dark strong full bodied beer, dark brown in color with very low hop bitterness. malty flavor , aroma and with a clean finish.","Wisconsin, USA","krypitol56"
4200,"2008-06-15",3.5,"Poured a dark brown colour with a full sized tan head. Aromas of raisins, biscuit malt, brown sugar, dark chocolate and subtle hops on the nose. Mouthfeel is very smooth, rich in many flavors- caramel, bread, and toffee. Finishes with just a touch of soft bitter hops.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","phishpond417"
4200,"2008-05-19",3.5,"[Growler, thanks Skyview!] Pours dark brown with a very light tan head. Aroma is a really unusual toasted malt, and some chocolate. Taste is the same with what I believe was some wheat also present. Medium-thin mouthfeel with a long finish. A pretty solid beer.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"
4200,"2008-05-09",3.7,"Growler courtesy of Skyview.  Dark brown color with a medium head.  Chocolate aroma.  Chalky taste.  Lots of chocolate and dry grains.  Almost feels gritty from the grain.  Very full body.  Quite good.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
4200,"2008-03-28",3.7,"Just added today! On draught at the brewerys taproom in Wausau, Wisconsin. Pours a clear dark reddish amber brew with a creamy off-white head that slowly dissipates to a fine film and off-white ring. Aroma of sweetened caramel malt, a nice balance of grassy and citrus hops, a touch of raisin and some light brown sugar. Taste is medium to full bodied, light carbonation with flavors of sweet caramel malt, a touch of toffee and some metallic alcohol presence. Finish is semi-sweet, very malty that hides much of the hop bitterness with a nice alcohol warmth added. Though this beer is considered as a dunkler bock, this beer has a personality that is almost in the doppelbock category.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
