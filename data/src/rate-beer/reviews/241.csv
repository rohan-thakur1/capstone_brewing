241,"2016-10-04",3.4,"This is Not a Koelsch. It is a very nice beer though. No koelsch yeast aroma. Flavor is too hoppy. Malt flavor is nice but muddled by hops. Finishes grassy with noble hops like a German pale ale.","Austin, Texas, USA","rgf001"

241,"2016-08-21",3.4,"Can. Pours a very light gold with just a hint of green; head is bright white, pillowy, mixed-grained, and very solid with lace. Nose is apple, banana, papaya, wheat cracker, lavender, and a little white pepper. On the tongue, its really substantial, with lemon, lemon peel, and fresh biscuits up front; on the midpalate theres more citrus and more grain, with a chewy fresh bread note and a very clean finish. Hefty; this is a rarity for me, a worthwhile American kolsch. Long lemony finish; sticks around and reminds you how good it was.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"
