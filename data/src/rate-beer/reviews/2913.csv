2913,"2015-02-15",4.5,"I found this today at a local grocery store in the mountains and couldnt believe there was a JK there! The cider runs very sweet similar to an Angry Orchard Muse or Iceman but retains much of the flavors like some of the unfiltered Finnriver or deluxe Crispin. The maple is very distinct in it where it almost has a caramel flavor to it. I highly recommend this if youd like to try a naturally sweet cider that isnt as processed as many of the ones on the general market and is organic :)","California, USA","Cidertron"

The apple scent is sadly a bit rotten, and while I dont really get the impression of cinnamon or vanilla, theres definitely something adjuncty in it...seems more sugary than anything though. Mediocre and a bit novelty-ish.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Clear, pale, fleshy pinky-yellow colour, fairly carbonated, bubbly foam dissipates rapidly. Aroma is caramelized apple, brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon. Palate is more of the same sweet notes, balanced by the dryness provided by the ripened fruit and alcohol fermentation. Not boozy in the slightest though, very drinkable. Delicious.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","bulldogops"
2913,"2013-12-29",4.3,"Wow. Great Cider. Sweat and slightly tart apple flavor. Then the vanilla hots you balanced with the maple syrup and cinnamon. Wonderfully balanced and tastes great. Only negative would be the price, at $6 or 7 a 22 oz bottle, it's not an every day cider.

2913,"2013-07-11",3.8,"At this point, this is the highest rated cider Ive ever had. 
The heat is on J.K.s Cuvée Winterruption Farmhouse Hard Cider... start liftin.

I like the nice pale straw color of the cider, I like the haziness, Its cool that there was a bit of head retention for a minute, but for a cider thats totally extra credit showoff stuff. 

The aroma is nice & reminds me of Sutliff Cider, its very apple-y & sweet smelling with light spice but never really enters the realm of apple soda. Some nice unfermented apple cider & some nice minerally bits in there, not especially complex but inviting enough. 

I can see from the flavor why this is well regarded. It is far more rich than most ciders tend to be, and its sweet in a way that isnt like apple soda much in the way that many sweet fermented ciders seem to be. Its sweeter than I would like it to be, but at the same time its got some serious things going for it. Specifically, its got this remarkable brandy note... gracious its as if they aged it in Cognac barrels.... I attribute this to a perfect use of the above mentioned spices to give such an effect while tricking the palate into thinking it the flavors came from something other than spices and vanilla beans.,, because these are complimentary as opposed to dominant notes. The cider has a nice tartness & doesnt taste specifically like a green or a red apple in any sort of general way, but is by all means certainly apple-y.
Well, it looks like this skeptic is won over.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Light fruitiness, touches of cinnamon like spiciness. Some touches of oak, vanilla, more honeycrisp apples. Finish is lingering sweetness, touch of tartness.

2913,"2011-04-03",3.7,"Bomber. Pours a slightly petillant gold with tiny tiny white bubbles. The aroma is mellow fresh apple, a little bit of cinnamon, and a tame sweetness. The flavor is smooth tasty apple, a touch of cinnamon, and a lovely smooth vanilla that wasnt evident in the nose. The maple is noticeable in the aftertaste. Its fairly sweet, but a little bit of an acidic edge cuts through it to keep from becoming cloying. This is surprisingly good.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

2913,"2011-01-14",3.9,"Appearance: Pours out a hazed, golden-toned body.

Smell: An opening aroma of apple, lightly tart and lightly sweet, followed by vanilla and cinnamon spice. A long sniffing session finally yields a hint of the rumored maple.

Taste: Sugary sweet taste of apple juice spiced lightly with cinnamon. A faint, fleeting earthiness precludes the vanilla and maple which is punctuated by a bit of alcohol and apple tartness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation.

Drinkability: Its tasty, sweet, and reasonably spiced. A nice seasonal offering.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Very nice cider.","Edison, New Jersey, USA","mackus2"
2913,"2011-01-03",3.3,"Bottles from Whole Foods. Consumed in between the holidays from pint glasses.

Disturbed sediment, out the cider came a hazy(though vibrant) gold. Thin, skim milk head.

Chalky cinnamon, mild bulk cider(edging towards sweet), small hint of maple syrup, citric acid, & a hearty amount of doughy yeast round out the smell.

Taste-wise, spices arent intense, though you could say the amount of vanilla used is a bit much. Mushy golden delicious apples(apple complexity is mostly lost in this blend), caramelized without the added body(thankfully). Sweet & not much acidity. The alcohol is more then noticeable on the finish.

Mouthfeel is powdery with a slight heft to it. Decent beaded carbonation that could take to being a bit stronger even.

A nice change of pace.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"

Spicy apple aroma- hints of nutmeg, vanilla, and definitely cinnamon.  I could smell the beer from three feet away and it smells like fresh apple pie.  Cinnamon and almost a roasty apple flavored body.  A little wine-like as other ciders usually are but it is less pronounced than others.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
2913,"2010-11-20",4.0,"Pours a straw-colored yellow with considerable cloudiness.  Aroma is primarily of maple syrup and secondarily of apples--definitely sweet.  Taste is, first and foremost, sweet.  The flavor of the apple is evenly matched by the additions of vanilla, cinnamon, and maple syrup, each of which is discernible.  Alcohol is noticeable and becomes more so as the cider warms. But even when cool to cold, the cider is extremely flavorful.  In spite of this sweetness, theres a certain dryness where the cider itself is concerned--quite crisp.  Mouthfeel is lively, with tingly carbonation--just about what youd expect for a cider.  In sum, this may be the best cider Ive tried.  Now, I know that the additions of the vanilla, cinnamon, and syrup dont make for the most ""authentic"" cider. Whatever. This is seriously flavorful, and while some may find the sweetness too cloying (entirely possible), youd be missing out on something special if you passed this one by.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","elektrikjester"

2913,"2010-03-13",3.0,"UPDATED: MAR 18, 2010 A bomber given to me from a friend at work!  Thank you Brian!  Looks like good homemade cider, somewhat like a hazy hef. No signs of visible carbonation within. Some gunk on bottom of the bottle. Smell is sweet like apple juice. Lots of cinnamon on the initial taste. Not a fan of cinnamon in cider but at least at first its not overwhelming. Comes across somewhat artificial at times buit still not bad. Not sure if I like these other flavorings in my apple cider.  Doesnt seem to come across like 7%.  Very little CO2 in this stuff. Apple is there but agtain there may be too much other stuff in here to make it sessionable. Fairly good and enjoyable, Certainly a holiday drink. This would be right at home on a cool fall day. Yep, does not really seem to be 7% at all, goes down way too easy. Finish is fruity fine with just a tad of medicinal feel to it. Not a bad spiced cider. Would not mind having again!","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"
2913,"2010-03-06",3.0,"First off, I think that one is rating a cider, they should rate it as a cider, and not a beer.  Having said this, the cider has a nice aroma... you can smell the vanilla and a bit of alcohol.  Its not a strong aroma by any means.  The appearance is what you would expect of very cloudy apple cider.  The Flavor is very very sweet of course, and it blends well with the vanilla and other spices but inevitably they are overpowered by the apple.  I find myself wanting more of the spices, but then I am drinking apple cider, and they are not meant to be the main course.  Pretty decent stuff.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","FastEddie"
2913,"2010-03-02",3.1,"Bomber. Pours hazy gold, no head. Aroma is very much like non-alcoholic cider with cinnamon, This is probably the sweetest smelling cider ever, quite surprising. Flavor is very sweet apple, cinnamon, slightly on the syrupy side. This tastes very natural to me and would be fabulous to drink in autumn. I could see how some people might find this to be too sweet. I dont know as I could drink more than one glass.","Washington DC, USA","zebracakes"

2913,"2009-12-29",4.2,"In the bottle from Beertopia. Pours a dark reddish gold to amber color with a rapidly disseminating effervescent head. The aroma is fairly standard apple cider with little indication of the treat awaiting. The four-part flavor blast runs from apples to sweetness to vanilla to tartness. Jumping around in there is a jangle of cinnamon, but only a bit. This is like an apple pie in a bottle. Just incredible. My only knock on it is the unnecessary marketing scheme of having it be ""organic."" All that does for the beer is raise its price. I think that this was the best holiday treat of 2009.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","SledgeJr"

Aroma of apple juice, cinnamon, brown sugar, maple and a bit of raisins. Sweet, earthy and slightly minerally. Light alcohol tinge. Flavor is a whole lot better than the regular Scrumpy. Still sweet, but not cloying. More of an applesauce thing going on. Cinnamon, minerals, vanilla. Light bubbles and a decent thickness (high F.G.). Light tangy citrus-apple pie thing going on in the finish.  Still un-naturally sweet, but loads better than their first attempt. They actually make the sweetness work in this one.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
2913,"2009-12-19",4.0,"Bottle from Brother Eric as a b-day gift. Pours thera-flu semi-clear pale orange with not much head to speak of. Nose is rich cider, cinnamon spice and slight vinegar. Taste is sweet and pleasant apple cider, cinnamon, some slight clove and vanilla, as well as a very small hing of maple that really compliments nicely. The flavor is really smooth and lightly carbonated which is perfect for the style of beer this is as well as the flavor it brings. The hint of vinegar on the nose turned me off at first because I have a strong dislike of said flavor, yet it is nowhere to be found in the taste, which is an added bonus, for me anyway. Excellent to sip on, yet each taste leaves me wanting another. Apple spice flavor lingers in the mouth for a long, long finish. I opened my first Christmas present of the season earlier today, but this beer is what marked the start of the holidays IMHO. As the bottle suggested, I couldnt help but try it warmed as well. 30 seconds on high produced a significant sharp bite on the back of the throat, as well as a much more pronounced cinnamon/spice, but overall I think the flavors diminished a little. Cold wins for me....going back in the fridge. Excellent Winter Beer!","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","awiseman01"

Has a nice head like beer too.  Then the taste is a softly sweet apple with that creamy vanilla undertone that sets it apart from any other cider Ive had.
