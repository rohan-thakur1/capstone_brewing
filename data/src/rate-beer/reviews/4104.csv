4104,"2015-03-03",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2015 Draft pour at the Pine Box. Pours a clear copper color with very little head. I love the beers with a small story to it.  Reading that this was aged for about 800 days. Crazy! I hadnt even started drinking beer when this was in the barrel aging.  Definitely makes this beer unique to me. Flavor has a sour green apple like flavor with a heavy lingering sour taste. Really nice sour.  Enjoyed this.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

Pours a pale gold, and actually has a nice head to it. 

The aroma is funky and barnyardy. Its got a bit of sour fruit and oak in the nose. 

The flavor is dry and tart with a good dosing of lemony character and general sour fruit. Its got a nice white grape character and some earthy & oaky tones.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

4104,"2013-05-07",3.3,"On tap at Brasserie - Pours clear amber with a thin white head. Nose is yogurty, tart vinegar--sour, but not too complex.

4104,"2012-08-21",1.7,"FoBAB 2011. This one was a bit hyped and then, not sure why this flopped. Tart aroma.  Funky odd I think theres a little microwave popcorn there. Diacetel city flavors. Tart fruits lactic with lots of Diacetel. Insane amounts. 4/3/3/2/5","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"

4104,"2012-02-11",4.0,"Tasted on draft at FoBAB 2011.  Pours clear, pale copper with an average white head that leaves a thin collar of lace.  The nose is tart and sour with lemon peel, white wine vinegar, and just a touch of vanilla.  The flavor is bitingly acidic with some bread malt, lemon, white wine vinegar, and barnyard funk.  The body is light and tannic with average carbonation and a long, sour and acidic finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
4104,"2012-01-08",3.6,"Thanks for the growler, Adam.  Pours a clear orange color with minimal head or carbonation.  A really nice funk to the aroma.  Theres some earthy musty notes to it and a bit of lemon peel and green apple.  The flavor isnt quite as good.  Its a touch vinegary.  Theres a little malt sweetness to it as well.  A bit of lemon peel, maybe a little Smarties.  Medium bodies with low carbonation.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
4104,"2011-11-22",2.2,"FoBAB 9. Hazy gold, large bubbled white head. Nose is extreme aceto with the sulfer notes from Lambicus, green and spicy despite light dough. Flavor is ultra sour, eggy citric, harsh, light acetic qualities growing through mid, very thin and oily. As close to Lambicus as Ive seen, more juicy and Santa-Fe like. Hate these kinds of beers, oddly enough very few Belgian unblendeds are extreme like this.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
4104,"2011-11-19",3.4,"On tap at Fobab 9. Pours clear pale golden with white head. Aromas of funk, horse blanket, and some tartness. Flavor is horse blanket, funk, bit of a fruit note, buttery, and decent amount of tartness. Little disappointing.","Mount Prospect, Illinois, USA","msante79"
4104,"2011-11-18",3.5,"Sampled from the tap at 2011 FOBAB. Poured a near clear gold with a slight amber hue and a white head that lasted throughout the beer. Aroma had a good amount of funk and a surprisingly sweet note of tropical/light fruits. Flavor had a good amount of acid that cut the sweetness with some dry wine and funk that finished out the beer. After taste was a bit odd, but cannot put my tongue on it.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
4104,"2011-11-17",3.4,"Draft at FoBAB 9. Pours a mostly clear deep golden. Nose is decent, touch vegetal, big barnyard funk and a certain freshness to it as well. Not perfect, but charming. Tartness and some cherry notes are pulled out of the nose but the vegetal is a bit distracting. On tasting, crisp acidity, more of that kind of vegetal note. Dry finish, quite bready. Would love to try again and will give another fair shot. Not perfect.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
4104,"2011-11-15",3.9,"A hazed amber lambic with a thin off white head. In aroma, a beautiful lambic with sour cherries,light buttery notes, Epsom slats, horseblanket.

4104,"2011-11-14",1.9,"Excited to try this, as the early ratings indicated promise. This sample had problems.  Buttery, rotten fruit.    Vegetal.   Dirty pond water funk.   Some rotten yogurt sourness.   Not very enjoyable.   Witnessed kan drink this later in the day and note that it was a completely diffeent animal than the awesome beer he tried on a prior occasion.  Not sure what happened with this sample.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
4104,"2011-11-04",4.1,"had this on a couple occasions. first time was directly out of the keg thanks to the headbrewer and then this second time, thanks to a partial growler fill courtesy of adam.... pours a hazy and muted dark red grapefruit reddish pink hue and topped with a minimal layer of soapy white head.  sightly transparent in nature allowing some light to pass through. some small floaties are also suspended within the liquid... aroma is sharp and acetic , almost bracingly so but stops just short, with notes of strawberries and sour lemon juice. subtler notes of vanilla and oak come through late... flavors compliment the aroma with a burst of sourness coming through first but then mellows out offering a touch of mild sweetness. red fruits and berry sourness for the duration leaving a light sour acetic burn as it goes down.  light to medium bodied with adequate carbonation throughout.  softer grains and oak come through late. solid american sour thats for sure.  id certainly search this one out again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
4104,"2011-10-31",4.0,"Two drafts served in a goblet at Destihl in Normal.

Murky orange, hazy with particulate matter (fruit skin, barrel residue, who knows). Thin ring of white foam at the edge, no lacing, a thin broken skim across the surface. 

Fruity citrus and yogurt aromas, some wet hay as it warms, lactic tartness and fruity acidity. Soft and pleasant, straightforward though not especially funky or nuanced. Fruit forward with orange, lemon, and green strawberry notes.

Puckering acetic acid at first, fruity lemon and citrus flavors, residual brett aftertaste. Clean lactic finish that practically vanishes without a trace. Well carbonated, effervescent and light bodied. Lacks a little bit in the complexity department, but otherwise tasty. Definitely quenching and drinkable. Very reminiscent of Uplands lambic output, possibly due a similar inoculation of lacto and brett. Also comparable to an unfruited version of Destihls Sour Strawberry.","RIP Johnnies, Chicago, Illinois, USA","emerge077"
4104,"2011-10-30",4.3,"Snifter pour on tap at the brewpub (Normal, IL). Pours a hazy dulled golden hue, lively carbonation with a frothy bubbly brighter white head that dies to a film, laces ok. Aromas are heavenly, preaching a lively dose of lactic acid, lemons and hay, funky straw, touch of cheesiness. Some more oak, gentle barrel mixes into a healthy sourness, sweet tarts, healthy straw, flaked wheat, touches of nuance and funk behind that Destihl blonde sour feel. Initial is medium bodied, offering a healthy fruity quality, some esters mix with a healthy lactic acidity, lemons and apples, crab apples, flaked wheat, gives it a touch of girth in the body. Middle showing lively fruit and sourness, moving into some yogurt and more lemons, getting a lot more yogurty into the finish, crisp and sour, lingering with some oaky qualities. Finish lingers of lactic acid, lemons, fruity crab apple, touches of pear, straw, drying out. Overall, acidity isnt overpowering, but is firm. Really nice, not thinned out, offering a touch of body and great wild yeast character, healthy sourness. Really enjoyed this, over three years in the making, with a solid sourness that doesnt eclipse the solid sturdy funkiness years in the making, and doesnt thin out the body. Top notch beer.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
