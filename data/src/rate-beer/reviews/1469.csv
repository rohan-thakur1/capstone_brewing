1469,"2017-06-19",4.6,"W zasadzie mógłbym przepisać ocenę z wersji podstawowej, ponieważ beczka podkręca nuty waniliowe i kokosowe z wersji non ba, ale nienachalnie, dalej to wszystko świetnie współgra przy tym potężnym syropie klonowym, każdemu łykowi towarzyszy zachwyt i uśmiech. p.s. mam wrażenie, że tu nie jest tak jeszcze świetnie ułożony alkohol jak w podstawce. Ocena jednak ciut wyżej niż normal. Najlepszy imperialny porter jaki piłem i jedno z najlepszych piw ever. Cudo!","POLAND","dzudohonor"
1469,"2017-06-17",4.2,"Pours pitch black with only a few mokka bubbles that fade quickly. Very big maple in the aroma. The most Ive come across in any beer. Coffee, cocoa, vanilla but no real trace of barrel. Unless that barrel only contained maple syrup. The taste is very maple, coffee forward. Typical Omnipollo roast/bitterness but this time accompanied by a slightly thicker mouthfeel than your noa or yellow belly. Must admit I expected a little more complexity from the barrel. The maple is awsome but I find it a little simple..","DENMARK","Hoprider"

Taste is very sweet and syrupy with hints of sweetened, artificially flavoured coffee, chocolate, red wine and alcohol. The high alcohol actually helps it.

Maple level is pretty much insane. Light raisins. Sweet, bitter, malty, roasty & nutty taste. Viscous round slightly boozy decadent mouthfeel. Insane beer with tons of barrel & maple.

1469,"2017-03-18",4.6,"Draught at Brewers Beer Bar, Göteborg. Opaque black. Take all the good things for Lorelei and than add a lot more. Huge body, huge flavors. Lovely coconut, bourbon, vanilla notes. Insane and incredible.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rlgk"
1469,"2017-03-18",4.4,"From draft at Brewers beer bar, poured pitch black with a light mocha ring on top. Nose is already such an improvement of the regular lorelei. Way more charred coconut in the nose, the barrel could have added that character to it aswell, thick maple syrup goodness, marshmallows, coconut oil, light oak notes, vanilla, toasted caramel. Taste is like the regular lorelei, but extra thickness of maple, vanilla, and light charred oak. Thick sticky mouthfeel. I wasnt a fan of the regular lorelei out of the bottle, but this is absolutely incredible","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
