266,"2017-06-06",3.1,"Many thanks to Erzengel for sharing! Pours almost clear like water. Aroma of medium sweet and dry mellow, a bit sticky and boozy. Taste of strong yellow fruits like mellow, rice, some yeast, boozy finish.","P´Castle, GERMANY","Beerhunter111"
266,"2017-05-25",3.4,"Thanks to erzengel for sharing!! Pours clear like water. The smell is mild fruit, alcohol ethers, light grain. The taste is some fruit up front, light grainy sweetness with a somewhat dry ending. Light an a touch oily.","Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, ENGLAND","ThirstyBird"
266,"2017-05-15",3.9,"Nice and slightly grainy nose. The Saké starts smooth and fresh, very clear. Dry with fruity hints, very round and crisp. The body is dry with great fruits of pear and melon, fruity, minimal sourish, extreme aromaful and round, very clear and dry, subtle and fragile, but deep and intense. Nice stuff!","Wuppertal, GERMANY","Erzengel"
266,"2016-06-05",3.4,"Damn near clear and still. Grape, pear and alcohol nose. Sweet pear and grape, light floral, and hot alcohol taste. I dont know much about sake, but this is a light, easy drinking drink.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
266,"2016-06-03",3.0,"Bottle at Snowbird. Nice yellow body. Nose alcy, rice and floral. Taste similar with fruits, rice. Quite strong ABV taste.","Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA","altonbrownd"
266,"2015-08-19",2.8,"Bottle. Pours a clear gold-green with no visible bubbles or anything else for that matter. Nose is stone fruit, almonds, acetone, and a slight medical/iodine note. Dry and sharp on the tongue, with definite medicinal notes; some stone fruit and melon, but mostly crisp and acidic. Finish is warm and edgy. Prickly.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"
266,"2015-06-19",2.8,"Sample at Kroger. Clear and colorless. Nose is white bread and ethanol, with a touch of juniper and not much else. Sweet and bready flavor, with a slight bite. Light body, a little burn, and otherwise clean. This is an uneventful and boring sake. Not bad, just not much going on.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"
266,"2014-08-14",3.2,"Clear maybe a slight cloudiness. Sweet banana like flavoured penicillin I had as a child. Taste is a creamy smooth sweetness. Not bad for a Junmai.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"
266,"2014-03-07",2.5,"(bottle - 330 ml) Clear water pour. Light fruity aroma. Some pear and banana. Very sour and fermented. Light pear flavor but is completely overpowered.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"
266,"2013-12-02",3.6,"330 ml bottle from Michaels Liquor Store in Riverhead, NY. Pours a clear very pale straw gold with no head. This is still. The aroma is rice with a touch of fruitiness to it and some alcohol vapors that have a bit of an industrial quality to it. Hard to explain really but its not just straight alcohol vapors that I am getting. The flavor is quite nice actually with more of a brown rice flavor than white rice, a touch of nuttiness, and light caramel sweetness. Smooth and silky on the palate, although there is some noticeable alcohol heat towards the finish. Medium bodied. Enjoyable.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
266,"2013-06-17",3.1,"Another Oregon sake how does this keep happening to me.  Anyways bottle drank on train out to long island, since greg brought it along I knew it was fairly cheap.  Pours yellowish water.  Nose of alcohol and rice.  tastes of alcohol, rice, floral, plastic, and light melon.","New York, USA","Jow"

266,"2013-04-24",2.4,"Airplane glue, honey dew, and strong koji nose, in that order. Crystal clear and yellowish. Medium body, hot. Flavor is very much like airplane glue, but non-viscous. Definitely not quaffable, but what sake is?","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
266,"2013-03-03",1.4,"Clear with a very very faint straw yellow tone.  Aroma is kinda weird.  Its got some fusel alcohol notes alongside some artificial banana notes, a touch of bubblegum, canteloupe, and rice grain.  Flavor is still and light with a watery body.  Zero booziness except for in the beginning, there is this light fruity astringency with a melon/rice/artificial-banana flavour that I wasnt particularly fond of.  Flavored alcoholic water.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
266,"2013-02-13",3.3,"A nice pale yellow body, clear.  Aroma was mainly of alcohol, notes of rice and pear.  Flavor was well balanced and similar to the aroma.  Alcohol was somewhat strong.  Very dry on the finish.  Nice, but left a little something to be desired.  Alcohol may have hidden some of the softer flavors.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
266,"2012-02-19",2.6,"The aroma is very alcoholic with grass, wood, and some fruit. The appearance is light yellow with no carbonation. The taste is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. Overall pretty good.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
266,"2012-02-19",3.7,"very smooth, lots of flavor of wood and grass. a nice smooth palate but with a real harsh flavor. the alcohol is strong but it doesnt take away from the sake itself","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
266,"2012-02-02",3.0,"Bottle (Japan production). No head (still). Body is very light yellow. Aroma is light notes of kiwi, honeydew, grain/rice, plastic, bubblegum, nail polish remover, and alcohol. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Light to medium body, watery texture, no carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic, lightly to moderately astringent.  The aroma is a difficult one to rate...first, it is quite light, you do have to hunt a bit.  Second, while there are nice fruity notes to it and none of the usual glue-mold smell of Junmai-and-lesser sakes, there *seem* (and I could be wrong here) to be some plastic and fusel notes mixed in as well...nothings strong, mind you, and it isnt offensive really, the various components come and go with some regularity.  I studied this one on and off for quite a long time alongside the Black (with two separate fresh pours of each)...there is admittedly something just plain odd/off in the Silver that I do not find in the Black.  Neither are particularly great, but something in the nose of this one bothers me a bit (the bubblegum note is another thing that contributes to my unease, its not exactly unpleasant but makes this smell kind of artificial...is that Windex in there too?  See what I mean?).  Otherwise fine in the mouth, no dirty aftertaste or anything, with a very nice balance of sweet, acid, and astringency.  Probably would be a 3.4 without the few disconcerting aromas.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
