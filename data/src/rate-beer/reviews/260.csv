260,"2015-02-09",3.7,"Bottle shared with my wife. Pours rather clear with a soft yellow tinge to it. Sticky sweet rice with a bit of banana and old melon behind it. Medium bodied, sweet rice porridge and warm melon. Warming alcohol and light sweetness on the finish. Warm and smooth.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

260,"2012-06-03",2.6,"Buttercream frosting on the nose. Clear colorless save for a very slight greenish hue. Sweet and hot buttercream, honey, cantaloupe, and koji flavor. Thin and very watery. Not really my kind of sake.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"

260,"2012-01-31",2.1,"Bottle. No head (still). Body is colorless. Aroma is notes of grain/rice, alcohol (slightly fusel, e.g. acetone), glue, mold. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, slightly unclean. Light to medium body, watery texture, no carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic, lightly astringent.  An ultra-simple rendition with only the standard rice-glue-mold aromatics.  Maybe a touch fusely, not terrible but a little unwholesome in the nose and aftertaste.  Not repulsive but not enjoyable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
260,"2012-01-09",3.4,"Gold flake version. Clear pour with yellowish hint and gold flakes floating about. Grainy rice, koji, banana and melon comes through in the aroma. Much the same in the taste, but banana and melon are much stronger in the flavor. Smooth body, decent sake.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
260,"2009-03-03",3.2,"Bottle. Pours with an ever so slight yellow tinge to an otherwise clear body. Very weak legs, if any. Aroma of alcohol, almond, vanilla, koji, umami, grass, and a bit of cantaloupe. Taste is heavy on the koji, medium to sweet with a decent amount of umami meatiness up front. Lingeringly sweet with honeydew melon. Alcohol is much more mellow than it is on the nose. Relatively pleasant. A bit thin on the mouthfeel, but balanced. Lingering aftertaste (longish duration).","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
260,"2009-02-22",3.4,"Pours clear with a gold tint.  Smells of rice and alcohol with some fruitiness present.  Tastes sweet and boozy.  Easy drinking.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
260,"2009-02-18",3.3,"Bottled. Tons of koji in the aroma, melon, grassiness, not too complex. A bit of grain alcohol lingers on the palate, with more koji flavors, florals and mud. Very basic sake.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
260,"2008-12-21",3.3,"Ive left this poor sake specimen to age and wither in my basement for a year, but when I came back from Seattle to Colorado with a newfound affinity for sake I was glad to have it all the same.  By the good grace of my past-self, the sake had been exposed neither to light nor to heat and was in good condition by the time I poured it, chilled, into a wine glass.  There it sat, expectantly, calmly, clear and lucid save for the slightest touch of gold, no doubt from the unintended aging.  The aroma is very funky, redolent with koji, a once hostile aromatic but now an addictive element in most sakes Ive sampled.  An impish grin of musk melon debuts in the aroma after two or three labored sniffs, but I am immediately repelled by a very strong vapor of alcohol burning the lower periphery of my nostrils.  Despite this hostile chemical attack, the flavor is rather soft and smooth.  The alcohol takes a more complementary approach, and the flavor is diluted, even watery.  It takes some deliberation, but I conclude that the flavor is not weak.  Maybe a little feeble, but mostly a soft brush stroke of moderately dry, rice flavor.  A heavy palate and a tingle of sweetness of the aftertaste growing stronger as it acclimates to room temperature make this an extraordinarily, approachably soft and simple sake.  Give it plenty of time and the sake will even bloom with some peach and raspberry notes in the finish.  Certainly not a detailed sake, I wouldnt hesitate to serve this to first time sake drinkers, so long as they plug their noses.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
260,"2008-12-21",3.4,"300 ml bottle.  My first experience with Sake.  It pours quite clear with just a touch of cloudyness, could be the cold temp at which it was drank.  Our waiter suggested to drink it with a few slivers of cucumber in our glass.  This gave it a bit of freshness added with the smooth rice and alcohol flavors.  Quite good, I am stil not sold on drinking Sake over beer, but something a little different","Hamilton Twp., New Jersey, USA","NJBeerman013"
260,"2008-08-18",3.6,"(300 ml bottle from 1828 Vintage House) Served lightly chilled. Poured clear as water. Aroma of rice, yeast and alcohol. Wine-like mouthfeel, lightly dry. Legs/lacing consist of droplets along inside of glass. Flavor is quite hot and yeasty, on the sweet side with a strong fermented rice taste. Maybe even a touch bready. I enjoyed it more cooler than warmer. Feels quite refined but quite potent! Seems like a better than average sake.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"
260,"2008-06-09",3.9,"a clear color with a light aroma sweet rice and a vaguely nutty character. A surprisingly potent  flavor with citrus undercurrents and a light nuttyness  a light finish with smooth body.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
260,"2008-05-06",3.1,"Pours clear. Thin lasting legs. Nose is alcoholic and sweet like tereyaki rice. kind of remindes me of triple bock. Taste is about the same and the mouthfeel is coating.Finish is a bit warming. Not overly impressed here.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
260,"2007-12-17",3.2,"300 ml bottle from City Market in Burlington, VT (December 2007), consumed from the fridge in a White Winter Winery glass.  Totally clear, slightly oily, still appearance; the clearest-looking sake Ive had yet....faint, spidery, persistent legs....entrancing if low-key coconut-almond aroma, lightly ricey, no alcoholic harshness....sweet, thick and fairly simple flavor profile, with alcohol growing in strength fairly quickly; finish slightly medicinal/industrial in character and not all that pleasant, but the midpalate is nicely cotton-candy-like with a hind of sugared nuts....this isnt bad for the price I guess but far from my favorite thus far.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
260,"2007-11-03",3.3,"Bottle from Jungle Jims served cold. Poured clear color with good legs. Medium rice alcohol aroma. Medium body with a dry texture. Medium complex flavor with a medium complex alcohol finish that was of moderate duration. Solid drinkable sake.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
260,"2007-09-13",2.5,"375mL bottle at Fugakyu on 8/25/07Watery appearance with poor legs/leg-retention.  Very clear.Extremely nutty in the nose, with almonds and sharp peach esters.  Gains a rather unpleasant paste/glue-like note with not-so well-concealed alcohol.  Kind of like what sake shouldnt be.  Though its no cheap ozeki, it just isnt pleasant after youve had better stuff.Same goes for the flavor, raw, unrefined and without any real delicate flavors.  Too much nuttiness and alcohol, with bland rice hull.  Not light or fruity or elegant in the least.  Fusels are very problematic.  Sluggish texture (for a sake).  Its cheap though....","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
260,"2007-08-09",2.7,"Bottle: Pours essentially like water, no legs. Aroma, rice, boozy, some fruits. Flavor, rice, some light fruity notes, and something that I just could not enjoy.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
260,"2007-02-13",3.0,"about 99.5% clear, a small twinge of yellow.  A nice sweet delicate aroma and flavor a nice sweet finish with notes of alcohol.  Really smooth and crisp, some dryiness to the finish.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
260,"2006-05-22",3.3,"Bottle: Clear color with no legs. The nose is full bodied with a light grainy character, light alcohol and a bit of dusty koji, no sweetness or melon yummyness which I like. The flavor is rich with good umami and a nice feel on the palate. Semi-sweet with a buttery finish a light alcohol feel. Extended tail. I can see what theyre going for but its missing something.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
260,"2005-08-15",3.3,"08.15.05  Just a dew drop away from colorless, light legs slickly run down the cup.  Mild fruit, more like a wet grain; and slightly stale smelling like water thats been sitting too long in a pitcher.  Flavor is warm and tropical with some hints of a chile spiciness.  Thank goodness the flavor pulled through what was an otherwise a odd aroma.  Still a somewhat stale finish, dry, again followed by a reemergence of coating and slick fruit.  Given the ABV, I think the heat level is entirely appropriate.  Its a lot of flavor to come out of something so clear.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
260,"2005-06-19",3.1,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2006 Looking just like water, it has a mild fruity aroma with some alcohol and a hint of Corn Flakes.  (Admitedly, the latter makes little sense even to my addled mind.)  Peppery on the tongue, theres light juicy fruits here, as well.  Long dry finish.  It must be good,  I just cranked up the music...<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?
