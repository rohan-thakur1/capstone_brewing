4203,"2013-04-08",3.7,"A vigorous pour into my Teku glass produces an amber / brown tinged, dark tan colored head. The beer is a concentrated, burnt amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich red hue when held up to the light. The aroma has a malt depth to it that is offset by a mild, spicy, herbal hop character. Specific notes of German black bread, toasted whole grain notes, ample toasted nut notes, rounded brown bread aromatics, and perhaps a touch of roast character towards the finish.

Up front there is a light, herbal hop character, this immediately focuses on the rich malt though. Roasted / Toasted nutty notes, toasted whole grain bread, German black-bread flavors, burnt caramel notes, and richly concentrated malt caramelized notes. Hints of bitter roast malt in the finish combine with a light hop bitterness to provide just enough of a bite to finish things off; in fact this has a bit more hop character and bitterness than most German examples of the style. The body has a nice chewy richness to it that coats the palate well, yet it is not cloying.

Definitely a nice brew, it is certainly an interpretation of a Doppelbock that leans towards the American tradition; a bit more hop character, and the malt character isnÂ’t as rich and complex as it could be, but it is still mighty tasty and much more interesting than I was expecting.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
