1262,"2016-11-02",3.6,"BB Backlog, Pours a copper gold with 2 finger head. Smell is pretzel, bread, and other nutty malt notes. Taste was most of the same with some caramel, toast, and subtle grains.

1262,"2014-06-18",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 5-23-12- 
Served on cask in a pint glass

Appearance  Served an orange-copper color with a thin off white head. The head faded very fast leaving only a very light amount of lacing.

Smell  The aroma is biscuit in nature mixed with a bitter hop aroma of earthy and citrus nature. There are light spice and herbal aromas mixed into the nose as well which overall create an overall very pleasant aroma.

Taste  The taste is biscuit up front as the nose would have predicted. In the middle some of the citrus hop flavor and spice then comes into to the tongue. The citrus loses ground fast but the spiciness gets stronger. In the end the spice flavors mix with the bread an herbal/grassy flavor and an earthy hop flavor to leave a bitter spiced flavor on the tongue.

Mouthfeel  Typical for a cask beer this one was creamy in body and low in carbonation. It was nice and smooth and very drinkable.

Overall - The flavors of this beer taste and transition well making this one a very easy drinking bitter with a nice smooth feel and taste.","","Darkmagus82"

The flavor is more bitter than most ESBs, lots of toasted malt that lingers nicely, nicely dry though theres a touch of fruitiness. Lighter bodied with soft gentle carbonation.

Pours a clear golden amber/orange color with dark golden orange hues when held to a light and one finger frothy white head that quickly fades into a very thin lasting ring. Minimal lacing.

Slightly earthy hop aroma but the nose is dominated by a sweet malt character. Hints of earthy pine and very faint sweet citrus balanced by toasted caramel malt, rye and biscuit.

Medium bodied but fuller than expected with a hop forward flavor that lingers into a dry finish. This is quickly countered by a strong malt backbone with hints of caramel and biscuit. Although this is decently balanced, the hops are the star here with a lingering bitterness and dry finish.

Poured with a nice frothy and bubbly slightly off-white head. Great lacing throughout the sample. Deep, dark brown color. Sweet malt/prune-like aromas. Hop bitterness is not present. Deep, rich maltiness, dried fig flavors stick out. Dry hop bitterness finish. Medium MF, and nearly mouth-coating. Very little carbonation for the style, but not anything that detracted too much. Not nearly as drinkable as other ESBs that Ive sampled. This is mainly due to the lack of hop bitterness to balance out the malty richness.

1262,"2003-02-09",3.8,"Ruby red brown color with a cloudy undertone.  Tasty more hoppy than malty, but a nice backboned fruity taste (plums).  Not overly complex and lacking the thick head and lace that I would have appreciated.  But a nice beer to drink with a plate fill of mexican nachos.","Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania, USA","ARMed"
1262,"2003-01-17",3.4,"Enjoyed this on tap at the brewery.  Served in a small glass with almost no head, beautiful deep chestnut or copper color.  Surprisingly for a bigger beer than Uncle Teddy, the mouth was thinner and harsher than I expected, with more pronouned alcohol.  The beer is more bitter than it is malty, a very good copy of Fullers ESB.  Of course, ESB is not my favorite of Fullers' beers and it is not surprising that an accurate American rendition would also not be my favorite of Victory's beers.  However, as always Bill and Ron did a wonderful job of achieving what they set out to do.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"

1262,"2002-10-13",3.4,"Hand pump. Rather thin with a tannish body and a white ringlet head. A tad watery though there is some malt sweetness. Wispy bitterness that finishes rather confusingly.","Medford, New Jersey, USA","jcalbi"

1262,"2002-07-12",4.6,"(on hand-pump).
great ESB.
copper color with a soft head. floral hoppy nose. taste is initially malty  then the sharp pungent hops com through, ends with a bitter dry finish.
great smooth  palate, a superlative job of cask-conditioning.","Bombay, INDIA","ravidesai"
1262,"2002-05-19",3.7,"A very nice ESB, definite hop presence balances well with the malt backbone. I think it could have had a slighter stronger malt flavor though.","Jeannette, Pennsylvania, USA","dolemike1"
1262,"2002-03-09",3.4,"Ive had much better ESBs, would have been better on a hand pump, a little watery, not much body to the brew, but a decent taste","Pottstown, Pennsylvania, USA","obxdude10"
1262,"2000-10-15",4.0,"Being a Hophead, any beer that is highly hopped is a hit. Malty, hoppy, high on the flavor scale.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
