4479,"2017-01-13",3.9,"Sampled from 750ml bomber and shared by Guerde. Pours a semi-clear golden copper amber colored brew with an average sized off-white head that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some excellent lacing. Aroma of brown sugar, roasted nuts, caramel malt, orange zest and a touch of powdered malt. Taste is full bodied, with flavors of raisin, brown sugar, mild brandy, apple and some orange zest. Finish is semi-sweet and a little boozy, followed by a powdery brown sugar aftertaste. Light oxidation but still enjoyable.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

Rich and flavourful. Borders on cloying but I like it over all. Abv well masked","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"
4479,"2016-03-26",2.5,"Pours with minimal head and orange body, heavy aroma of fusels and coriander and orange zest and cloying sweetness oh my. Flavour is this huge caramel bomb with a vague hint of armagnac and sugar. I havent had an armagnac in years but remember well what theys tastes like and this has hints of that but is otherwise a huge cloying sugar bomb. Nonetheless the alcohol does not really overpower, its the sweetness that does. Maybe a bottle as a dinner digestif to be shared would be a good idea. This is not even sipping beer, this is dessert wine beer. Thats a new one, another category for RateBeer?","Alberta, CANADA","DeanF"
4479,"2015-12-20",3.5,"750ml capped bottle pours a murky light brown color with a 2 finger off-white head that leaves only a few spots of lacing behind. Aroma is brandy and syrup with a definite alcohol presence. Taste is a very fruity and syrupy sweetness with a grassy and herbal bitterness and alcohol burn throughout with some brandy in the finish. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Overall, a very strong brew that is not for everyone.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
4479,"2015-09-23",3.9,"Part of a 750 ml bottle from LCBO, served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass. Deep copper, clear, with a decent light tan head. Sweet and boozy with lots of caramel, toffee and treacle, dark dried fruit, boozy barrel character, brown sugar, more alcohol, berry-like fruitiness, big, big beer. Full bodied with fairly low carbonation. Tons of sticky sweet maltiness, quite boozy, brown sugar, treacle, raisins and figs, so big, fairly big alcohol kick; quite sweet with firm bitterness and a long, very boozy and very malty finish.

4479,"2015-01-03",4.2,"Deep amber pour with a thick creamy white head. The nose is intensely aromatic. Rich vineous cognac aroma. A cooling sort of honeyish aroma/ flavour as well as an intense malt sweetness. The alcohol cuts through the sweetness and gives it a nice rounded quality. Vineous and a little bit peppery. Rich but balanced. Really damn tasty.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

4479,"2014-11-29",3.6,"750mL bottle, sent from wilco (thanks a lot, Mike), pours a cloudy deep dark orange amber with a small beige head. Aroma brings out brandy liquor, loads of alcohol, and stone fruits. Flavour is very strong, bringing out stone fruits, alcohol, and a touch of liqueur. Despite the booziness, this doesnt taste like 14.5%. Quite a nice slow sipper.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
4479,"2014-11-02",3.8,"Pours reddish teak into the glass & offers very little in the way of a cap. Its such an inviting nose, I cant wait to dive in. Taste is sticky & sweet: tawny port, figs, burnt toffee, flavoured pipe tobacco & dried fruit. Mrs Tiki makes a Québécois dessert every Christmas called Sugar Pie & this reminds me of a slice of that deviant delight, albeit this is a serious spiked version. Speaking of the booze, its clearly there at 14.5% & offers a bit of warming. Its just before dinner -- sausages on the grill & autumn root vegetable slaw if youre wondering -- & 1/2 a glass has given this barfly a nice buzz. This is a fantastic brew. Highly recommended. As is Pootzboys epic review below.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Freaky_tiki"
4479,"2014-11-01",3.6,"Slightly hazy dark copper pour, with a small off white, beige head. Lots of dark ripe fruit. Booze soaked fruit cake malts. Burnt brown sugar, and loads of caramel. The barrel adds a woody sweetness, and some earthy vanilla, and subtle spice. Sticky, oily mouth feel, low, and soft carb. Finish is quite sweet, vinous in its alcohol. Low bitterness, intense brown sugar and dark fruit. Boozy, sherry, cognac finish, with candied apples. This is an absolute bomb of a beer. Reminds me alot of a cross between and eisbock and an old school super strong English barley wine. Quite complex, share with a friend.","Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, CANADA","robinvboyer"
4479,"2014-10-02",3.6,"[Bottle at The Sacred Oak event, Indie Alehouses Barrel House, Sep.13] Pours a hazy deep orange with a spare lasting frothy white head.

Flavour is quite sweet, notes of toffee and caramel as in the aroma. Light alcohol is surprisingly restrained on the tongue but warming in the throat. 7+ Smooth medium to bodied palate, soft carbonation. Enjoyable, dangerously drinkable for the strength.

4479,"2014-09-13",3.9,"A hazed amber eisbock with a thin mocha head. In aroma, sweet caramel malt with vinous notes, alcohol warmth, dark fruits, plums, very nice.

4479,"2014-07-14",3.3,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2014 Bottle. Pours a dark amber with an off white head. Aroma has a lot of sweet dark fruit, some veg and toffee. Full body, medium carbonation. Medium to full body, medium carbonation. A whack of booze, a bit harsh, lots of figgy, sticky dark fruit... Balance is off, too sweet, too boozy, but its OK.

4479,"2014-07-10",3.9,"Bottle  750ml Dark green champagne bottle  crown capped- kept from light in a container tube
 
Ambience  cool summer night, consumed by a roaring campfire with a meal of fresh caught steelhead, cooked on a cedar board served with basmati rice and capers and fresh fiddlehead greens.
Serving temp: spent about 30 Min. on ice in the cooler  approx.  45deg. F
Serving container thick glass tumbler (chilled)
Color and appearance  Pours a dark murky chestnut color with a moderate off white cap which fades quickly to a clinging surface lace (not surprising for a high gravity brew)
Aroma - Complex  changes and gets more pungent as it warms but the core elements are  figs, port, Rich roasty grains  like toasted pumpernickel with cocoa, wet oak, light smokiness, just a hint of yeast funk, some fusel tones . You get different amalgams of these aromas as it warms - Complex but clean.
Character  Rich, full bodied, verging on silken mouth feel but it gets a tad hot in the finish from alcohol, solid malt spine.
Flavour profile  A big hit of roasty malts and dark fruits up front, lightly sweet, hops provide some spice and balance although malt and dark fruit esters carry the profile here...mid palate you get complex flavour impressions - muscatel, raisin bread, pipe tobacco, filberts, Madera, woody tones....long rich, warming finish.
Overall Impression- This is a well designed dark ice process big lager (eisbock). Very judicious selection of hops and malts along with care and control in the brewing, aging and ice process has yielded a really unique vinous-like bock. If you didnt know what you were drinking youd swear it was a rich fortified wine of immense gustatory sensation. I love Bock, I drink a lot of it, but it pales in comparison to this. I have had a lot of high gravity doppel bocks but this is a new experience  very much like one of the intense beers Brew Dog were experimenting with but easier drinking. If there is a drawback, it is that the alcohol is a tad evident now for some palates, but a few month/years in the cellar will certainly improve this eisbock. I will be buying a few bottles to cellar because Im deeply curious to see what bottle aging will produce  if they last that long.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"
