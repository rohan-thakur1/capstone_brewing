892,"2016-07-21",3.8,"(Un verre à Smallwares, Portland): Floral, bonne acidité, aspect crayeux, légèrement tannique et chaud dans la texture finale.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
892,"2015-09-20",3.8,"Served with courses 8-11 at Alinea on 9/19. Reserve pairing. Percebes - smoke, seawater, ash, Tororo Kombu - hamachi, ice fish cracker, Unagi - pickled plum, white sesame, and Corn - uni, nor, togarashi. Pours almost clear, quite still. Strong melon aroma with obvious alcohol, passion fruit (and socks...), peach, and mint. This is a touch sweet. It has a nice cutting acidity. The alcohol is mild for the ABV, but a bit peppery. Its a bit dirty end palate, but quite clean for a sake. This worked really well with both the sweet corn/uni butter as well as the salinity and smokiness of the percebes. Quite nice.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"
892,"2013-05-07",3.3,"It pours light green tinted. The aroma has notes of: pears, shiitake mushrooms, wet dirt, and rice pudding. The taste is medium sweet that finishes light bitter; there are notes of: rice pudding, bitter melon, and alcohol. The palate is medium-full bodied, slightly thick, and a long smooth finish. Overall, quite enjoyable.","Ontario, CANADA","chris__hartley"
892,"2012-02-06",4.1,"Bottle. No head (still). Body is ultra light yellow (almost colorless). Aroma is notes of honeydew melon, kiwi, lime, pear/apple, flowers, peach yogurt, honey, pepper, alcohol, rice. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Medium body, watery/silky texture, no carbonation, moderately alcoholic, lightly astringent.  Wonderful stuff.  Aromatically clean and vibrant, absolutely leaps out of the glass with fruity/floral notes galore...almost more like white wine than sake.  Seriously, the aromatic difference between something like this and a bog standard junmai is night and day.  And how they can get such evocative fruit character out of rice is amazing.   Excellent, clean flavor balance and delightful mouthfeel.  The 16.5% is remarkably well hidden (compare to, say, Bride of the Fox, which is quite boozy).  By far one of the best sakes Ive had to date.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
892,"2009-06-20",3.9,"Out of 13 different sakes sampled this was my second favorite.  Melon and mint on the nose, with some alcohol notes.  Pours clear.  Melon flavors with peppery anise.  Very good sake!","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
892,"2009-05-31",3.9,"Taste @ Shibuya, Las Vegas: Pours a clear color, paired with a hamachi trio of sashimi. Nose of ample anise and pear with a very bright and lively with very little koji. The flavor has a large body but is still sweet and delicate with lots of anise. Good sake in the nose but it doesnt have much for tail or finish. Excellent to sniff though.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
892,"2008-07-07",3.4,"Pours clear and still.  Smells of rice, some vanilla, some alcohol.  Tastes the same.  If my descriptions sound the same, it’s because the main difference between any of these was the intensity of flavor.  Otherwise, they are all pretty much the same.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
892,"2008-05-05",4.0,"Clear color, with a little bit of yellow or creaminess.  Aroma is quite buttery and some wintergreen.  Creamy taste and mouthfeel.  A bit of pepperiness.  Alcohol is extremely well hidden.  One of the best sakes Ive had.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
892,"2008-04-11",2.9,"300ml.  Pours light, bright gold with lasting legs. Anise initially dominates the nose. Faint tropical fruit as well. Pours a very light, bright gold with thick legs running down the glass. Simple flavor with notes of liquorice, rice and alcohol. Medium bodied. Slightly viscous and cloying. Simple, mostly enjoyable, but certainly forgettable.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
892,"2007-07-21",3.9,"Very light yellow color, but still seems very dark for a Sake based on my limited experience.  Delicate floral nose with rice sweetness and an alcohol bite.  Flavor begins with with a strong floral flavor and then shifts to rice sweetness mid palate.  The finish begins with black pepper bite followed by alcoholic warmth.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
892,"2007-03-11",4.5,"A viscous sake with pronounced licorice bouquet, a fresh, medium-sweet taste  highly fruity, floral and spicy  again the licorice coming through.  Full-bodied and balanced with a long finish.","USA","ldr514"
892,"2005-09-29",3.0,"A Junmai Ginjo, 55%.  Pours a with a slight yellow tinge.  Aroma is fruity with some alcohol.  Taste reminds me of apricots and mellow apples, with a little more alcohol around the edges than I wouldve cared for.  Not as complex as many better sakes, I thought this was  very drinkable and enjoyable.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
892,"2005-03-22",1.7,"Clear as water.  The nose held a hint of fruit but mostly alcohol.  A little syrupy feel to the mouth and smooth.  The flavor was, well, like drinking rubbing alcohol.  No thanks.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
892,"2005-03-11",2.8,"pours clear pretyt much like water.smells lightly of fruit, alcohol, & mint.  Palate is very light a little coating.  Tastes very complex lightly fruit, some real alcohol flavor, a tiny bit of bitterness, maybe a bit buttery... not great but OK.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
892,"2005-03-04",3.3,"Very light greenish-yellow tint, steady legs. Aroma is velvety, mint, grass, light fruit, green apples, and occaisional annoying off-aroma that I can only describe as having a fake feel (maybe crushed Smarties mixed with water). Otherwise its a great aroma. Slightly coating mouthfeel and very smooth. Hard to pick out flavor... mostly a light fruit. Finishes with alcohol and a slight bitter bite. Noticable, but not too bad of a alcohol burn.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
892,"2004-01-21",2.4,"Starts off with a faint aroma of fruit.  Has a light taste of green apples.  A sharp sake, with noticeable alcohol burn, the Biho has none of the buttery/oily quality that I enjoy so much in some of the imported sakes.  The alcohol burn was a real disapointment, frankly.  I won't revisit this one.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
