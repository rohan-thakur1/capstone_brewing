1890,"2015-07-28",3.4,"This was originally poured into a nonic pint glass. But after smelling and tasting it, this was nothing remotely close to an English Pale Ale. Because of knowing the ""house"" yeast Mystic usually uses, I figured this was misrepresented on ratebeer and decided to rate this as an American Wild Ale.
This was then poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a soft burnt orange color with a one finger white foamy and a slight bubbles in and around the foam. Lacing concaves with the glass nicely.
The smell starts off with a crisp lemon leading into a nice lemon rind, somewhat bitter, semi-sweet and leading into a settling sweet refreshing grassiness. Sour notes intricately weave a light grapefruit, and a little bit of mango.
The taste starts off sour and leads to the semi-sweet crisp lemon, lending a slight hand to sweet refreshing grassiness. A lingering sticky sour to sweet lemon rolls into the aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonation runs smooth and allows light bitterness to accentuate a semi-harsh feel over my tongue.
Overall, though not an English Pale ale, this is a really nice American Wild ale which is what Id want it again for.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
1890,"2015-06-11",3.8,"Undated (frown) bottle from Whole Foods River Street, drunk 6/11/15. Of note, whlie not dated, it should be fairly fresh and furthermore, this was kept in their cooler, not warm on the shelf.Deep brassy-peach body is intensely carbonated. So much so that its nearly impossible to not add some yeast to the pour thus turning it lightly hazy despite my best efforts. Immense head, then, well-retained and off-white.Lovely English yeast is apparent right away led on by the crackling carbonation and producing light plastic, cellar and heavy mineral character. It is smelled hand-in-hand with peachy-apricot hop notes that are folded in to soft, lightly sweet caramel malts. With breathing, the yeast dies off quite a bit, as do the hops, leaving a wake of light tangerine/apricot and allowing sumptuous honeyed malts to emerge. Light bitterness and minerality still sits on the end. Really nice and with no alcohol or sign of resin.Mild citrus, light stone fruit and leafy, green, moderately juicy hoppiness greets the palate as fruity esters, moderately well-attenuated malts (honey, very light caramel and sweet dough) and some light earthiness all blend together. Quite well-homogenized and a fair amount of balancing bitterness finishes the beer with the endearing plasticy/musty yeast notes coming retronasal. I say plasticy, which has a negative connotation, but mean nothing bad by it. Its full of character and not very easy for me to describe. Heavily carbonated (would hate to see what happens if this beer were stored warm) even after sitting in the glass for 30 minutes.Awesome stuff. Proof that you dont need next level hops (not that these arent done well, but theyre not the focus here) to make a lovely IPA/EPA. Hope to try the other two Wiggles from them.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1890,"2014-02-08",3.5,"Taster at RBWG 2014 grand tasting - thanks to the person who shared this! From a styrofoam cup... Lost my Sierra Nevada taster glass... Hazy amber color. Minimal white head. Dots of lace. Good orange aroma. Nice light yeast character. Some caramel malts. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, lighter carbonation. Lightly slick. Solid stuff, but its kind of tasting like a saison to me right now. Maybe this is ultra warm, or more likely my palate is blown. Or maybe this end part of the bottle had more yeast characteristics than a regular sample should have had.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

1890,"2013-11-29",4.1,"Hazy yellow/orange with a white head, and a big slug of yeast in the bottle of the bottle for conditioning. Amazing citrus hop aromas, wasnt expecting that from a traditional English-style ale. Spice and yeast also on the nose, its one of the best beers Ive ever sniffed. Its sweet and juicy to drink, with more spice notes and just a little bitterness. Some pine presence makes itself felt in the aftertaste, along with a little bit of vaporizing alcohol. Feels a little thin in the mouth and ends in a dry finish. Really happy with this one, the best Ive had from Mystic yet.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ScipioA"

1890,"2013-11-15",3.7,"Sampled at the brewery. Pours hazy golden/amber with a lacy, white head. Aroma of floral, spicy, and lightly citrusy hops plus a pale and caramel maltiness. Flavor the same. Average texture. A pretty good beer.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
1890,"2013-10-23",3.9,"The beer pours a rich, almost-amber in color, which also might be identifiable as orange-brown. The beer forms a small head of tightly knit, eggshell white bubbles that fizzle away to a scrim and leave strands and sticky splotches on the sides of the glass. The beer appears opaque in body, with lots of light coming through, but no notion of the other side of the glass visible. No particles or sediment can be found in the beer. On the nose, the beer smells like candied pine and orange peels with a touch of grapefruit pith. The candied note comes from a light touch of caramel malts which give the nose some interesting nuances. Pine and pith are quite big, but are not overwhelming or bristling in anyway. On the tongue, the beer tastes properly bitter with a soft sweetness and a touch of acidity giving the beer a nice balance, while still keeping it bitter and IPAish (if that makes sense). Flavor begins as bitter orange juice, quickly working to pine and orange peel with a touch of caramel bread and some soft medicinal bitters. The finish is on the short side of medium in length, with bitter citric and medicinal pine flavors, while the aftertaste is slightly sticky with pine and pith flavors. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium in body with a thicker-watery mouthfeel that makes it excellent to drink. Carbonation is gentle and a little fluffy on the tongue, and the mouth is left slightly dry with a soft sticky sense from the hops. Overall this beer is very nicely balanced, with a proper dose of bitters and enough of a sideshow to add complexity to the sip. This beer is perfect to drink, as it is a little heavy for sessioning, and far too light for sipping. Personally, I want a little more weight on the back end of this sip, but that might hurt the drinkability of this beer. The beer would also pair really well with pub foods, like spicy fries, buffalo wings, or potato skins. Mystics owner swears they wont brew an IPA, but theyve created quite a nice one here and I do hope they try for more. This beer will appease hop-heads and those looking for something that wont assault the tongue. Try it for sure!","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"
1890,"2013-10-17",3.4,"Pours hazy gold into a shaker. White soapy head with good retention recedes leaving spot lacing. Resin and grapefruit aromas. Soft with caramel butterscotch and toffee upfront turning to mild resin and pine in the lasting finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
1890,"2013-10-12",3.9,"Bottle from the brewery.
Pours a slightly hazy light golden color with a smallish off white head that slowly dissipates to wisps of foam on the top. Smells of spicy earthy floral hops and a hint of grapefruit pith. Light bit of diacytyl atop a light bready sweet sugary malt base. The flavor is bright with bitter hop flavor. Earthy citrusy hops meld with a crackery bready malt base. Light bit of diacytyl, ok for style. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. Nice flavorful easy drinking pale ale.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
