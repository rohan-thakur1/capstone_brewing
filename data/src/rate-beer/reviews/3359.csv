3359,"2017-02-18",3.7,"From a growler. Unfortunately the keg kicked as I was getting that growler filled so the color of this is an opaque, milky pale yellow with little to no head. Lots of sedimentary deposits. The aroma is nice with its citrus, orange, fruity, and pine notes. Buried sourdough bread sweetness. The body is smooth but light. The taste also brings out a notable citrus zing, orange, and fruitiness. Mild bitterness to end. It is a Session IPA that has the character of a standard IPA.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"

3359,"2017-01-25",4.2,"Ar: Massive, pungent hop aroma; resin, mango, pineapple, orange pith, tangerine; a bit peppery. Ap: Cloudy straw yellow; medium white head with good retention, leaving a thick cap of small and medium foam bubbles and some lacing along the sides of the glass. T: Burst of bright hops up front; lemon, pine, lime, orange pith, mango, and pineapple; extremely tropical; medium-high bitterness, fairly clean; malt character is minimal, just a bit of saltine cracker; finish is lots of lemon and pineapple. P: Medium-light body with medium-high carbonation; finish is dry. O: Wow, this is one of the best session IPAs that Ive tasted; massive hop nose and flavor, with that great combination of tropical fruitiness and classic hop flavors that make these NE IPAs famous!","Plainfield, Vermont, USA","Jabic"

3359,"2016-12-07",3.9,"Une biere orangée, trouble à en être opaque, avec une bonne carbonatation. Au nez, le houblon fruité règne, avec une belle dose de galaxy dryhoppé pour notre plus grand plaisir. En bouche, le houblon est également roi, sans être amer, avec notamment de la mangue qui est bien présente. Labsence damertume rend la biere fort facile à boire, définitivement de circonstance pour une session. Le 4-pack de cette lost galaxy doit décidément fort facilement se boire dune traite. Cette bière est définitivement une belle réussite.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"

3359,"2016-05-27",3.9,"Draught at Hugh ONeills on 5/16/16.Lightly hazy brassy-gold body is topped by a staunch, medium-sized white head.Fresh yeast, hay and mineral water notes precede a surprisingly clean, lighthearted galaxy hop profile which maintains mostly tropical fruit and seems to be fairly free of the heavy marajuana-like spiciness or any pine resin. Some earthiness and cereal grain character emerges, with warming.Tight carbonation and soft, malty texture provide a good vessel as the high attenuation and crisp citrus and mango hop notes keep the beer very drinkable. A fair amount of earthy, rather rustic house yeast character and grainy wheat is strongly apparent and somewhat dulls the brightness of the hops but is still enjoyable in its own right. Lots of fruit lingering with low bitterness and no resin. Delightful.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3359,"2016-05-06",3.8,"Pours pale yellow into a shaker. Bright white soapy head with good retention recedes leaving sheet lacing. Pineapple and mango aromas.

3359,"2016-01-10",3.7,"16 oz tall boy can with 10.02.15 date stamped. Pours a hazy golden orange color and topped by a small layer of off white foam that settles quickly to a thin film. Steaks of lace are left behind and slowly rejoin the body below. The aroma shows notes of tropical fruits with orange, grapefruit, and lemons with hints orpine resin, clean grain and wheat. The flavor follows with the tropical fruit sweetness, grains, and light wheat with nice citrus and pine hop bitterness on the back end. Sessionable and easy to drink. Medium to light bodied with balanced carbonation that leads to a bitter sweet citrus finish. The hops have stated to a fade a bit, but this is a very tasty and easy drinking session IPA. Nice stuff.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
3359,"2015-11-28",3.6,"Bottom of the can stamped ""10/02/2015.""
This was poured into a nonic pint glass.
The appearance was a glossy burnt hazy orange color with a slight transparency about it. Carbonation could be seen rising at a decent pace. A fingers worth of white foamy head started and dissipated within less than a minute. Speckled lace sticks and then slides into the beer leaving a film of a white glazed head.
The smell started off with a crisp bitter to sweet citrusy to piney contour rolling over some light tropical fruits as it warms.
The taste was basically the same with more tropical fruits coming out and portraying themselves in the aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonation feels good. The wheat does give the beer a nice feel to it reminiscent of Conehead but a bit lighter.
Overall, though I dont always like to compare one beer to another from different breweries, this is a nice session wheat IPA just a step down from ZGs Conehead. Id probably like this more in the Summer, not bad not, if anything helps in the break up of the stouts of the season.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Nice light body here with the hops strongly highlighted. Pretty good stuff, just dont drink it right after some Heady like I did one time.

3359,"2014-12-18",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 20, 2014 On tap (10 oz) @ Parker Pie. Split 2-ways with czar.

Appearance: Hazy yellow with a small creamy white head and little lacing. 

Aroma: Nice hops features, quite citrusy and piney with dank hops and hints of melon.

Taste: Citrusy at first, but the resinous presence doesnt take long too to be the dominant feature. Light, but effective malt backbone. Moderate bitterness. 

Palate: Light/medium body. Moderate carbonation. Dry and a tad harsh piney finish.

Overall: A good resinous forward IPA with a nice kick of citrus to get more balance. Quite drinkable despite the finish being a tad harsh. Good!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

3359,"2014-08-07",4.2,"Beautiful misted blonde. Herb packed aroma with tarragon and oregano in front. Citrus and stone fruits support with soft, juicy sweetness while the lemon zest of wheat waits for its moment. Intoxicating.

Remarkably balanced flavor finds specific corners of light for dandelion and green pepper spiciness, as well as the bright tang of the galaxy hops and the hearth like sourdough sweetness of wheat. 
That all this is accomplished in this low gravity space is impressive; the texture is rounded and dense, but always crisp. For me, only a bit more demonstrable yeast characteristics in the flavor and it would be unforgettable.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
