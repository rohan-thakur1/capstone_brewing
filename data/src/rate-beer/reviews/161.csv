A moderate roasted malt character and some firm bitterness turn what threatened to be a bit sweet and flabby into something that works. Theres a slight chile note in the coffee which is nice too.

Bottle. Pours very dark chocolate to black, with a nice brown head. The appearance is that of a huge volume of espresso, I found it quite opaque. The aromas are dominated by coffee and cocoa, as expected, but especially with a dark chocolate one, with a very subtle tinge of fruitiness (esters?).Taste is that of unsweetened powdered cocoa, delicious rounded -toasted- bitterness just like a cold espresso, long lasting finish that fades away into a toasted malt background. Stunning. Medium to full body, easily full body, to be fair. Creamy texture and soft carbonation. What a beer. Further notes: coffee and cocoa are evidently additions to the porter itself, so while it is a very nice brew, it is still noticeably relying on coffee and cocoa for the aroma and taste... whether you like these beers or not, thats down to personal preference.","SPAIN","Rhombic"

Appearance - opaque black with a lovely fawn head. 
Nose - dark chocolate but then this is overwhelmed by the coffee. 
Taste - more general mocha notes. Deep and luscious. 
Palate - medium to full bodied with a creamy texture and a long and very balanced finish. 
Overall - Im not a big fan of coffee in beer but this is great.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"
