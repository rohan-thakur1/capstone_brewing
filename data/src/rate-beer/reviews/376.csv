376,"2017-05-14",4.2,"Thnx to David ! Pours dark amberblonde. Small white head. Smell is full on funk and oak. Some lemon, some horse stable. Taste Is intense, funk, oak. High acidity, but still decentm much complexity. Horse stable, huge balance. Perhaps a bit to agressivly sour, but this has to be the most true-to-original geuze I had from the US.","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

376,"2016-07-03",3.9,"Bottle (750 ml) shared at tasting, thanks to Marc-André! Slightly hazy golden with a small white head leaving little lacing. Aroma is great with dust, horse blanket, citrus/lemon, oak and mild herbalness. Taste is a tad sweeter than what I like with moderate acidity, some horse blanket and funk, hay, dust, herbal notes, lemon/citrus presence and mild minerality. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Rather dry finish despite the sweetness impression from taste. If feels a bit too heavy to be world-class but it doesnt compromise the mouthfeel and the aroma is up there among the very good examples of the style. Theres not much missing to make this another homerum from Funk Factory.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
376,"2016-06-18",4.0,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is nice with a medium light wine barrel note. Some medium light acidic notes with some citrus, cherry, and pineapple. A light, herbal and earthy funk note. A light perfume note. 
Pours a hazy, golden orange with a small, thick, white head that recedes to the edges where it lingers. Faint lacing and no legs. 
Flavor is slightly sweet with moderate acidity. Some light citrus notes and pineapple with a bit of tart cherry. Medium light oak notes with a bit of wine character. Light herbal, earthy funk notes. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a very nice beer but I think the next batch through these barrels would be better. A bit too much of the wine barrels is coming through. Good fruit notes from the yeast though.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
376,"2016-06-13",3.1,"Sample at WOBFest 2016. Hold the presses - I found a Gueuze that I dont find repulsive! This one isnt so bitter and has a lot more flavor than others.","","Cousin_Larry"
376,"2016-03-14",4.4,"Looks and smells excellent immediately after pouring. Hints of floral and pepper accent the overall brightness of this gueze. Carb level was good and overall this will only get better with time. Thanks for the share Kraig Jordan!","","LancerUWM"
376,"2016-03-14",4.6,"This American style gueuze is absolutely fantastic. Its the best representation of its style that Ive had made in this country, and better than many Belgian made gueuze. The color and nose are what youd expect from the style, perfect carb level. The taste is similar to drie fonteinen oude gueze. Great funk, truly amazing. Its already developed nicely since its release, and Id expect it to even become better, somehow, over the next few years.","","Sourcrusher"

Next to dweller I was surprised to find that the dweller was even more amazing. I think this beer will age with the best of them - excited to crack my last one down the line.","","beerandbourbon"
