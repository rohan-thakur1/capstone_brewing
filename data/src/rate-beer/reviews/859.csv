Wow.  Just...well...not much of anything.  I think the ratings for the Ginjo from this brewer (Ice Dome) might be telling...if this were some sort of holy grail of brewers, that one should surely get scores mostly in the mid 3s (at least), no?  This seems to be a hype monster that people almost fear to rate normally, due to the price and rating trend.  I wanted to love it too, and man, I sure was excited!  I made sure I waited until Id tried a lot of Daiginjo, Ginjo, and Junmai so I had a frame of reference.  But...uh...either I got the most dull bottle on the planet or it really is just as ordinary as Ice Dome.  I would honestly say that the vast bulk of plain Ginjo I have tried has been more interesting and enjoyable.  This is better than most Junmai Ive had, but thats not saying much for being $35 for a 30cL bottle (and Ive only paid $87.50 or more for a 75cL bottle of wine a couple of times, so trying this was quite the test of faith, almost entirely because of RateBeer).  The truth is that the aroma doesnt offer much of anything...this is kinda like vodka (at lower strength), where theres only wisps of aromatics, and those wisps are not the sorts of things that make me giggle with delight...rice/grain, alcohol, and melon rind...thats pretty much it, anything else is subconscious.  Is it clean?  Yeah, sure, I dont get any fusels or other off notes out of it, but fuck me if theres anything to truly *entice* either.  Moon on the Water, Wandering Poet, Bride of the Fox, Southern Beauty, you can just about throw a rock and hit a Ginjo with more aromatic vibrancy and depth than this.  In the mouth its sweeter than most Ginjo, but certainly not approaching cloying or fatiguing.  Pretty strong alcohol, but about the amount of burn you might expect from something thats close to 16%.  I dunno, I spent a good hour reviewing this, and all I see are emperors clothes.  Im certainly not going against the grain for the sake of it...this sample is honestly about as bog standard as sake gets.  Pearls before swine?  Maybe, Ill make no claims to being a sake expert...maybe less is *supposed* to be more.  All I can say is that I like sakes with aromatic intrigue and better sweet/acid balance (and a bit more tannins would help too).  I really dont care if its brewed in an igloo or somebodys moms basement.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
859,"2012-01-18",3.8,"Bottle Pours crystal clear and colorless with few legs, but those produced are thick and meaty. Theres a lot of floral and fruity stuff going on in the bouquet, but fennel is definitely the star of the olfactory show. Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and no carbonation.

859,"2010-10-31",4.2,"While i often enjoy a good sake with my wife, the is my first attempt at rating one, so why not start with the Cadillac of Sake? Pick up a small bottle for $35,(ouch) so for the price, like others, I probably wont be developing a premium Sake habit any time soon. Goes well with some sashimi we picked up at Whole Foods, so will limit this to Sushi restaurants and food fare for pairing. 
Pours clearand clean, with a touch of yellow hues. Nice floral and rice aromas. Really opens up as it warms, with some apple and pear sweetness. Peppery finish that is dry and warming. The alcohol was warming but pretty subdued for me, which is unusual for most sakes ive had. Overall, this was very tasty and I was glad to try it. I can see why it is the top rated Sake on the site.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Doodler"
859,"2009-09-22",3.1,"This bottled sake from a bottle shop poured a very small sized head of frothy fine to medium sized clear colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a transparent uncarbonated light yellow hued body.

859,"2009-07-20",3.7,"300 ml bottle from beastiefan2k. 02,08 stamped on bottle. Pour is perfectly clear pale yellow gold. Shines like jewelry. Decent legs form on the glass during the swirl. Aroma of floral soft rice, with a faint pineapple citrus. Some apple, some pear - very soft and delicate. Taste is initially soft rice fruitiness, followed quickly by a bit of an edgy alcohol heat, followed again by the floral sweetness of the nose. The flavors transitioned really smoothly from one to the next. Palate is soft and clean, syrupy - coats the mouth beautifully, yet almost feels like its gliding down your throat. Really no residual alcohol heat. I have laughably limited knowledge of Sake, but quite liked this one. Not sure I will rush out to explore more, but will happily keep an eye open.

859,"2009-06-01",4.0,"Im happy to get around to rating this sake, as it was my first really premium sake--and provided a lasting memory for me...

I had a a 750 ml bottle of this big dog and passed it around during a hotel tasting.  Most people there didnt enjoy it, or had already had too much to drink, so it came back to me around 2/3 full I would say.  Now this is an expensive bottle, somewhere around $100--so I felt like it must be finished.  So I sat there at around midnight or so, on a day in which the drinking had started at approximately 8am--and didnt stop for more than an hour during dinner--and began to drink the rest of Divine Droplets straight from the bottle. 

A beautiful clear body. The flavor was a very light mix of almond extract, honeysuckle and anise.  Really clean taste with a nice body.  Its difficult to describe just how light this is, while at the same time having a heavy dose of flavor.  

In the end this Daiginjo had its way with me and caused me to pass out sitting up in the bed in a room full of obnoxious drunks.  Im proud to have finished the bottle after such an amazing amount of consumption, and lived to have told the tale.","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"

859,"2008-10-29",4.2,"Pours still and crystal clear with a yellowish tint.  A swirl of the glass reveals some thin, runny legging.  The aroma is a beauty, showing licorice in the forward, followed by notes of mild koji, lemon meringue, cream, and fruity cantaloupe.  Flavors are similar, again very licorice driven, with notes of melon liquor, dry koji, and a hint of spiciness on the finish.  Some chiffon-like creaminess shines through as well.  The palate is silky smooth, creamy, and clean.  This paired wonderfully with spicy sushi, and I can see it working well with Thai food also.

Late ethanol and rice-like burn.  Not overly, harsh, though.  Light sweet and sugary flavors to start before the ethanolic booze takes over.  I suppose this is good for a sake, but I guess I don’t really understand why this is so much better than some of the other sakes I have had.  Certainly not worth the $32 I payed for this thing.

859,"2007-10-01",4.2,"This sake pours w/ a faint tint of greenish yellow. The bouquet is very elegant and refined w/ well integrated aromas of fresh candy fruit, lively perfume, and red licorice. Medium nectar weight and dry w/ a brisk, mildly  fruity charcter. Flavors  consist of crisp candy fruit, creamy vanilla, buttery kettle korn, and a sort of floral arraingment. Theres a defined alcohol componenet that takes charged in a subtle way and seemingly directs the show gently guiding the ensamble to orchestral proportions. The finish is delightfuly clean w/ a lingering floral fruitiness despite the alcohol present. Overall: this pecimen does not go earthy in any way, shape, or form. It stays fruity and tamed by the director in a beautiful expression of perfection. I have to say that although I do appreciate the process of making this brew I think it is over priced for how it drinks @ $35 per 300ml.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"

Smelled like a sharp pinot grigio, with alcohol aparent through the fresh acidity.  Looked clear as water with no carbonation.  Smooth, thick and warming in the mouth, without any alcohol bite (amazing for this strength of beverage).  The finish was dry and herbal, and probably my favortie part of the experience.  The bulk of the flavor was just kind of...bleh.  I dont know if it was soy, but I didnt like it.  I wrote down that it was ""salty"" with ""low lactic sweetness,"" but those were accents to the general ""sake"" flavor.

859,"2007-04-02",4.1,"300 ml bottle.  I want to thank austinpowers for giving me some pointers about this sake and allowing me to taste this without being completely uninformed.  Poured mostly clear but with the subtlest yellow tinge.  Very subtle but complex aroma of butterscotch, light fruits, a bit of alcohol.  Flavor is very subtle, but upon intense reflection contains notes of vanilla, strawberries, perhaps a bit of apple.  This is some alcohol warmth to the swallow, but almost no burn in the flavor.  The finish starts out with a bit of a salty dryness but warms up to a rather sweet mustiness.  Very easy to drink.  This is definitely a drink that opens up more to you the more you reflect upon it.  This was a true test of my tasting abilities.  If the goal here was subtle complexity wtih little alcohol presence, then Id say the goal has been achieved.

I wasnt digging the aroma. The flavor brings these notes together really well, a faint fruity flavor (that I cant really describe) really shines here with a light body, almost velvety mouthfeel.

Faint aroma that teases you into guessing whats there. For me it was light sugary licorice notes. 
The alcohol warming comes immediately after the swallow and was only hinted at on the tongue at the very back, just before it went down the throat. The alcohol was unusually pleasant, not burning or uneasy to swallow in any way.  But overall, this was very tasty and I was glad to try it.

Squeaky-clean upfront, leading into a full, viscous mouthfeel: plenty of sugar and an almost honey-tinged, mead-like sweetness; chewy and full-bodied; notes of rice, watered-down berries, and fresh-cut flowers.  Very textured palate; lots of things going on here, and the alcohol is well-hidden.

Very clean, pleasing aroma. 
Clean, light taste. Oily texture. Taste fades fast. Fruit, but not fruit. Water, but not water. Malt sweetness, but not malt.
Really good overall. Its a shame its so expensive because I like it a lot.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
859,"2006-01-29",2.9,"Pours clear and crisp in the glass.  Smells of sushi rice.  Taste is fruity with some ricey elements.  I guess I dont get the whole sake thing since Im not picking up on any of the aromas/tastes others are.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
859,"2006-01-22",3.7,"Sampled at the Milwaukee YEHa!05: Pours a clear still with a watery appearance.  Very complex, sweet, light fruit, honeydew and floral subtle sugar aroma.  First taste has a full viscous sweetness and nice subtle rice and pear flavor toward a warming finish that hides about half of the alcohol.  A tasty sake, but not worth the $30/300mL to me.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
859,"2006-01-13",4.2,"Nice clear color,nicely fruity aroma  with some tones of coconut and maybe some flowery tones as well.The flavor was fantastic and highly dangerously drinkable.with a nice smooth feel to it some berry notes and some light hints of coconut and maybe even a bit floral,but mostly its just plain easy to drink and smooth as hell with just a light alcohol burn coming on at the very end.Great stuff","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
859,"2006-01-07",3.4,"Thanks to Tom for generously plunking down the cash for the bottle.  Great aroma - mild and sweet but still interesting.  Pepeprmint, melon and some floral notes.  Not much burn in the flavor but it has cheap bodka, juniper berries.  Long-lasting flavor.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
859,"2005-12-20",3.5,"Thanks to CaptainCougar for sharing this: Clear color, no head. ARoma of coconut, nose has a vodka like astringency. Flavor is very smooth, vanilla nad pices, lots of crazy fruits as well. Alcohol makes itself very well known in this one!","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
859,"2005-12-20",3.9,"Thanks to CaptainCouger for bringing a bottle of this expensive little gem.  The third sake in a row.  Aroma of bright vanilla, nutty hazelnut and a hint of chocolate, very perfume-y with a hint of melons in there also.  Clear as water with some  tall and thick legs.  Again that alcohol burn but quickly the flavor takes over with lots of vanilla and some chcolate and some peppery notes.  Finish lasts for a long time.  Fuller bodied with a nice and creamy feel.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
859,"2005-12-20",3.8,"Bottle ala CaptainCougar at the Milwaukee/Tosa Yeha. Very bright and clear with firm tall legs. A much fruitier aroma with light pear. Really ripe to the point of rotting melon also in the aroma. Fruits, herbs and spice seem to play in the flavor. Quite nice. Mild burn in the finish. Likely one of the better sakes I have had, but as Mike says ""Im far from an expert"".","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
859,"2005-12-19",2.9,"Clear water-esque appearance with thick slug-like legs trickling down the glass.  Rose leafs and ripely squeezed honey add an interesting dimension to the melba toast.  Subtle accent of strawberry scented plastic toys.  Dynamic flavor and palate presence, unfortunately reminiscent of paint thinner and nail polish remover.  Thanks for sharing this with the group, CaptainCougar!","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Pal is well coated feels light and airy.
Flavor has a warm finish toch of burn on the swallow light cocconut light sweet hint of a wierd berry.
Very good for a saki","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
859,"2005-12-17",3.4,"Thanks Tom!  Pours to a clear polished body with light legs.  The aroma is muskmelon thats been sitting around for awhile.  The flavor is quite overrated.  The palate is smooth and hides most of the high alcohol content.  The flavor is rice and muskmelon.  I may be crazy, but this isnt worth the $30 for a tiny bottle.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
859,"2005-12-08",4.2,"Rating #3000Sweet rice aroma with floral orange blossom, woody and bubblegum notes apparent.  Clear, still, wine-like appearance.  Very viscous with nice lacing on the glass and lightening of colour at the meniscus.  Floral/herbal component is strong in the sweet flavour with some hints of alcohol, rice and cereal and occasional fruitiness.  Strong alcohol warming attests to the 15+% ABV.  Smooth texture is quite viscous and dangerously easy to drink.  Bottle (Argonaut Liquors, Denver, Sep-05) sampled at the Falling Rock Tasting post GABF 2005.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
859,"2005-10-24",4.3,"(Bottle, courtesy of Kevin)  Pours a cyrstal clear with a sheen.  Aroma of Granny Smith apples, florals, vanilla, and cream.  Clean flavor of coconut milk, cream, and light alcohol.  Burns oing down.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
859,"2005-10-24",4.4,"Wow, what a treat.  Big thanks and a sad farewell go to Kevin.  Aroma has licorice, plastic, vanilla, ice cream.  Clear of course but not as bright water, perhaps a hint of color there?  Tough to tell from a ceramic sake glass that casts shadows.  Alcohol in the nose but only when you hold it in your mouth, otherwise for raw aroma and flavor theres nothing there but smoothness.  It dissolves like an angel cake.  What a special drink.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
859,"2005-10-23",4.0,"Bottle. Nose-light apple, coconut milk, and scotch tape. Very clear body with a tinge of yellow. Taste-alcohol, coconut milk, white chocolate, very warming.","Carrollton, Texas, USA","Lumpy"
859,"2005-10-22",4.6,"These are always hard because how do you really judge appearance in a ""beer"" sense. But this was easily the best sake that this feeble mind has ever come across. Truly ethereal. Mind melding. Yummy.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
859,"2005-10-09",4.1,"Claire et pratiquement incolore, larme dalcool glissant symétriquement sur la paroi du verre.  Arômes très floraux, dherbes et de grains de riz exotiques.  Flaveurs, difficilement descriptible, certainement très propre et pleine de classe.  Fleurs, herbes, subtilement sucrées, gomme baloune, vanille (?) Pratiquement aucune trace dalcool nest détectable mis à part du léger réchauffement arrivant à la toute fin.  Texture ample, corps dense.  Une classe à part et certainement sans comparaison possible aux autres sakés traînants sur les tablettes de nos SAQ.  Une bonne raison de garder un oeil ouvert pour ce genre de trésors dans le futur.  Bouteille, Denver CO.","Quebec, CANADA","OlivierMTL"
859,"2005-10-04",4.1,"Totally clear, uncoloured and displaying huge lasting linear and regular-spaced legs all over the glass. Aroma is strong and diplomatic with no notes getting out of control. Fully extracted grain, well attenuated rice. Extremely clean example with almost unnoticeable alcohol, no burms, no off-notes. Smooth, juicy, tasty and intense cereals flavours develop on the palate, procuring mellow pear/buttered litchis hints, always rice focused, but here and there suggesting a fruit note, always on a floral vanilla background. Flat bodied, very oily, vegetal texture, grainy and clean all the way through with astringence being no issue. So clean and smooth that it almost left me wishing for some kind of funk or more flavour complexity.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
859,"2005-05-04",4.3,"licorice aroma. slight, off clear appearance. taste is a rich mix of light fruit and very hard to put my foot on, maybe some vanilla and acorn with some kind of weird not quite sweetness. no burn at all  from the alcohol, amazingingly smooth. i can taste the quality difference in this. there is some kind of lingering chocolate and pear note. wow.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
859,"2005-04-01",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2005 Clear, light yellow color, spotty stickiness on the glass.  Aroma of vanilla, butterscotch, plums and a touch of alcohol.  Caramel and more vanilla in the taste, dry oakiness, and a clean finish.  Alcohol only noticable as it warmed my stomach.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
859,"2004-07-21",4.3,"Light yellow or beige. Aromas of kiwi, anise, marshmellows and almost a peppermint. Flavors of light mint and some melon. Very clean. Smooth and mellow. Tingly and warming.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"
859,"2004-07-15",4.5,"About the lightest color beige you can get before becoming clear. The aroma is very light and fruity, crisp and clean with notes of honeydew melon, licorice, faint coconut, and peach. Smelling this reminds me of late spring when the dogwoods are in bloom at the air is full of sweet fragrant flowers. The impact is very balanced with a noticable presence but easily discounted as an afterthought. The flavor is pure and clean, its just like a tasty pure complex spring water, you cant even tell the alcohol is here until you feel it in your stomach. This is a truly great sake and WELL worth the price for the experience. I dont know about a nightly thing, but I wish I could afford that!","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
859,"2004-01-05",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2004 In short, Divine Droplets is a remarkable drink.  A daiginjo of the highest order, you absolutely cannot taste the alcohol - and it's over 15%!  Further, the alcohol isn't hidden in sweetness like a Dogfish World Wide Stout.  The result of Takasago Shuzo's igloo-brewing process (see beer description) is divine, indeed.  Mild, mild, mild!  A wonderful, subtle aroma of flowers greets your nose, but not an aggressive one.  Tastewise, you've got a treat on your hands when you open this, but Divine Droplets is about subtleties, not brute force, so don't expect the fruity assertiveness of a Sato No Homare (Pride of the Village), but rather a semi-dry, non-oily, lightly sweet delight.  Pricey, but as always, you get what you pay for!  No color whatsoever.  Fantastic!","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
