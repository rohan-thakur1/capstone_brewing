Flavor is pretty nice fresh malts and hops. Tastes very fresh and bright. Notes of toffee and some diacetyl butterscotch. I dont think its off just a slight diacetyl from the kind of yeast they are probably using. It adds to the overall candyness of this beer. It also has a lot of toasty and roasted notes with mild bittereness and fruit esters. Almost tastes like an irish stout only not dry. Pretty good.","portland, Oregon, USA","SamuraiArtist"
