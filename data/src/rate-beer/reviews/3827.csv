3827,"2017-01-29",4.2,"Thanks, Treebs! Dry, floral, some botanicals. Touch of acidity. Great combination of flavors without going too far in any one direction.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
3827,"2016-09-27",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
White grapes, citrus fruit and flowers move into tartness and light funk for a very pleasant Saison-like experience.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the cloudy blond.
-Mouthfeel is appropriately effervescent.
-Drinkability is quite high if you are used to funk.
-Flavor clarity could be enhanced.

3827,"2016-07-19",3.7,"From notes. Enjoyed this at a tasting at Andrews house for my first tasting with the Ann Arbor crew on July 8! 750 mL bottle. The pour is a foggy golden yellow color with a thick white head and some good lace as it falls. The lace is excellent. The aroma is lightly tart and vinous with some floral spices and a decent funkiness. Its got a lot going on, and it just isnt as tart as I was hoping it would be. The flavor is more of a traditional saison. Its very dusty and carries a lot of spice with the Belgian malt ant yeastiness. The mouth feel is a little thin, but carries some nice carbonation. Its just not the level of tart I was hoping for in a saison. I guess its more traditional, and not bad, but it could be a touch better.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3827,"2014-04-22",4.3,"750ml bottle, shared with my wife. Pours hazy gold with white head. Aroma is downright pleasant. Juniper berries / gin play a prominent role, blending with citrus fruit, peppercorns, lemon zest, and a bit of funk for good measure. Taste: well thats downright pleasant as well. Dry; mineral; great interplay between the gin barrel and the base. Wine barrels subtly add to the mix as well, I imagine, but I wouldnt pick it out unless I was stretching for additional descriptors. Pleasant finish. Light-medium body, bring carbonation. Overall: one of my favorite releases from Upright so far. Im glad to hear this will be released annually, because Id love to have more.
