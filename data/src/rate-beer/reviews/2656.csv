2656,"2017-06-21",3.7,"Kolor:  Czarny, całkowicie nieprzejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Drobno ziarnista, brązowa, niezbyt trwała. Po przelaniu do szkła pojawiło się może z 2-3 cm puchu, który skurczył się do wstążeczki. 
Na krawędziach kielicha można zaobserwować niewielkie zacieki. 
 Zapach:  Miazga! Jest na prawdę grubo! Aromat beczek po szlachetnych alkoholach dosłownie obezwładnia zmysły. Początkowo czuć wyraźną owocową stronę beczki po brandy. Nie sposób wymienić wszystkie występujące tutaj owoce. Z pewnością nie brakuje śliwek, jabłek i odrobiny ciemnych winogron. Kiedy umysł przyzwyczai się już trochę do tej owocowej woni, na salony wkraczają solidne podwaliny beczki po bourbonie: mokre drewno i bardzo intensywna wanilia.
Bukiet aromatów uzupełniają nuty toffi, karmelu, cukru brązowego i miodu wielokwiatowego.
Solidnie, intensywnie, po prostu cudownie! 
 Smak:  Smak ustępuje odrobinę kolosalnemu aromatowi.
W pierwszym odczuciu piwo daje mocne odczucia kawy z mlekiem.
Brak nut palonych, ale wyraźna lekko osłodzona kawa.
Wtóruje jej gorzka czekolada. Beczka po bourbonie wysuwa się naprzeciw. Daje posmaki dębiny i mokrego drewna.
Beczka po brandy natomiast stanowi tło kompozycji. 
Nuty owocowe są wyraźnie stonowane i nie są już tak jednoznaczne jak w aromacie.
Dodać należy także trochę karmelu i odrobinę toffi.
I teraz najciekawsza sprawa - silne alkoholowe nuty! Ocierające się już nawet o rozpuszczalnik.
Z każdym kolejnym łykiem czuje potężne rozgrzewania w piersi i w przełyku.
Tekstura trunku jest umiarkowana.
W tej kwestii pozostawia wiele do życzenia.
Piwo wybitnie degustacyjne. Po jednej buteleczce czułem, że już kręci mi się w głowie. 
 Wysycenie: Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Aż wierzyć mi się nie chce jak to piwo potrafiłi ewoluować w czasie.
Aromat był po prostu zniewalający.
Piwo zwalało z nóg intensywnością doznań sensorycznych.
Beczka po brandy z jej charakterystycznym owocowym profilem. Doskonale komponowała się z waniliowym i dębowych charakterem bourbonu. 
Smak początkowo spójny i wielowarstwowy wraz z ogrzaniem zaczął zaburzać intensywny alkohol.
Piwo ma ogromy potencjał, ale sugerowałbym przeczekać parę miesięcy z degustacją.
Jedna buteleczka to wydatek 90-100 zł. Koszt bardzo wysoki, więc sugerowałbym przeczekać z degustacją w celu uniknięcia niepotrzebnych rozczarowań.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"
2656,"2017-06-21",4.6,"Piana średnia, sycząca, szybko opada do firanki. Barwa brązowa, nieprzejrzysta. W aromacie przyjemna wanilia, toffi, karmel, czekolada, do tego jakieś suszone owoce, melasa, porto, bourbon... Klasa! W smaku mamy powtórkę, jest słodko, lepko, jest lekka paloność, szorstkość, jest tytoniowa, nieduża goryczka w kontrze, jest w końcu całkiem fajne, pełne body, drobne, delikatnie kłujące wysycenie, rozgrzewająca brandy na finiszu (prawdopodobnie za rok byłaby wręcz niewyczuwalna).

2656,"2015-04-26",4.7,"Apparently a blend of a barley wine and an imperial stout aged on bourbon and brandy barrels - sounds promising. Vintage bottle of a few years of age, but the bottling date is unfortunately not mentioned anywhere. Deep brownish beige head, thin and creamy, needing some forcing to develop and breaking open in instants, but retaining well around the edges; colour is a very, very dark mahogany, almost opaque jet black. The bouquet is simply heavenly: a rich and absolutely beguiling perfume of warm chocolate sauce with cognac, cocoa, espresso, whisky, lovely vanilla tannins, candied dates and raisins, orange liqueur accent, liquorice, gingerbread, black pepper, old tawny port, pipe tobacco, dusty cellar but in a noble kind of way fitting in wonderfully, banana, cloves, aniseed... Unbelievably rich and stunning taste as well, starting with a deep bonbon- and subtly banana-like candied sweetness with sourish accents (candied lemon, but very subtle) as well as a finely tingling effect of both alcohol and carbonation, candi sugar sweetness but right in place (i.e. not cloying), plunging into an abysmal world of malts, very chocolatey, caramelly, nutty, with a very oily, fat, thickly vinous and filling body, evolving into a big finish of roasted malt bitterishness, yet gently so and not overly coffeeish, bitter chocolate, lots of oaky woodiness and tannins, peppery hops and of course a big deal of cognac-like alcohol, warming the throat and chest and stinging a little bit, yet still not becoming too obnoxious. I can see how this holds the middle between an impy and a barley wine. This is the beer equivalent of the finest liquor, be it cognac or single malt; absolutely perfect for a rainy Sunday afternoon. Simply divine.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

OCZY : piwo jest czarne o niewielkiej pianie. Piana jest brązowa. 

NOS : aromat jest średnio intensywny ze względu na śladowe nasycenie ale jest wyraźny : dominujące nuty to czekolada, bakalie, wanilia i alkohol podkreślony nutami bourbona i brandy od beczek z odzysku. Całość jest baaardzo przyjemna i ułożona. Łączy to wszystko głębia lekko dymionego i starego drewna plus ciemnego miodu. 

USTA : nasycenie jest bardzo delikatne o drobniutkich bąbelkach. Tłuste i gęste jak śmietana. 
Piwo jest słodkie ale nie lepkie. Występuje pewna wytrawność alkoholowa o nutach w stylu bourbona do której można dodać zwietrzałe rodzynki. Gorzkość jest również delikatna o nutach podobnych do czarnej czekolady. Posmak jest głęboki ale aksamitny bo nic nie zalega, ani nie jest cierpkie ani ziemiste.

Nagy formátumú, strukturált, magas százalékú alkoholok detonációja érkezik meg aztán lehengerlő erővel, az illatmolekulák egyszerűen belefúródnak a receptorainkba. Tüzes bourbon-aromái konyakkal átitatott faháncs, forró étcsokoládé, karamellás-kakaós-kókuszos-vaníliás belga édességek hangulatát egyszerre idézik meg; sötét és rabul ejtő a kezdés. Mint az várható volt, a kortyok önálló életre kelnek, és bár az alkohol masszív jelenléte a whiskys, brandys jegyekkel felülírhatatlan, sokszínű és megfejthetetlenül összetett jellege mentén lenyűgöző karakterek sokasága tárul elénk. Bár a jellemvonásai közeli rokonságot mutatnak egy vérmesebb imperial stouttal, kevésbé testes és mérsékeltebb módon szirupos jellege megdöbbentőbb vadsággal párosul. Mindez a kolosszális szerkezet egy bársonyosan szétterülő kakaós lepelbe van burkolva, mely simulékony étcsokoládés jegyekkel csalogat, a masszív alkoholos test vaníliás bourbon fergetege azonban megmutatja igazi erejét. Szeszben ázott fahordó füstös malátás zamatainak élét sós karamella lágysága puhítja, majd keserű likőrök zord lecsengése karcolja össze a képet.

Lost Abbey has taken out all the stops, and as I move from beer to beer I make an effort to go darker and darker. This strategy leads me to the Lost Abbey Deliverance, a deep, dark brew with a cratered head of muddy brown foam. Alcohol, licorice and molasses blend with all-spice, cardamon and soy in the nose, and the boozy nature of this beast appears in the flavor too. There I catch some bourbon flavor on a flat palate, leaving the alcohol not too sharp or cutting. Theres a low, oozing sugar too, with licorice, and a mostly sweet touch of brown sugar, vanilla, soy sauce and all spice.

Later aroma becomes too alcoholic and monolith dark caramel.

2656,"2014-03-29",3.9,"2011 vintage draught at Deep Ellum, Summer of 2011Very deep, dark amber-brown body shows high clarity and a large off-white head that shows moderate retention.Very bright, vinous, nearly liquorous-like fruitiness in the nose is complimented by plentiful sweet, candied cherries, chocolate and a drying, tannic, oak and alcohol character. Very strong aroma, but even as the glass wore on, it never got uncontrollably boozey. Lots of malt layers, with caramel, pale malts and even a touch of very light roast. Wherever the fruitiness is coming from, it really makes the nose, brightening all of the deep, dark stout flavors and heavy barrel tannins/woodiness.Strong notes of amber maltiness and light chocolate are easily disrupted by a softer oak woodiness and candied raspberry sweetness. Vanilla, oranges, cherries, raisins, and so on. Very complex beer and significantly more dry than the original batches of Angels Share, IMO. The alcohol actually seems to work proactively here to dry out all of the chocolate and roast and this forward fruitiness keeps it very drinkable. Delicious, top notch!2013 vintage on draught at Publick House on 3/20/14Much, much darker and thicker than the 2011 vintage in all aspects. Color, viscosity, flavor. Again, though, I wasnt blown away by the alcohol or heat. Yes, of course it was a powerful beer and probably too thick moreso than too boozey, if anything. Chocolate and vanilla, candied prunes and chocolate covered cherries. Quite a bit going on here for sure and certainly very supple and thick/chewy. I like it, but it seems more given to a vintage BA stout than it does the more moderate strong ale sensibilities of Angels Share (not that Serpents Stout is bad, by any means). Guess I just like the older vintage better. Rating is an average.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

No audible pop at corking. Pours like spent oil - inky black-brown with heavy viscosity and little sign of carbonation. Lots of prune, caramel, bourbon and brandy, raisin, figs, and hints of cinnamon sugar in this one. Really pretty nose. Profoundly rich flavored beer: caramel, tawny, bitterness (surprised), nougat, chocolate - light, bourbon, figs, sugar and slight booze. Quite still on the mouthfeel, a slight effervescence. Warm and dry finish with a long standing flavor residual.

Im a bit torn here. The smell and flavor of the beer are top notch, but the look and mouthfeel are far from superior. I wish the beer was just slightly cabonated - previous bottles Ive had were.

Chilled to 44 degrees then pulled the cork and poured into a fluted beer glass. Not much carbonation at all. Very dark brown - not quite black - but almost. Just a heavenly aroma of sweet toffee, caramel & chocolate coffee. Took a small sip - just enough to wet the buds. WOW, a whole lot of complexity going on here.

Oily with low carbonation - maybe a tad too low. Taste is at first very sweet and butterscotchy, then some burnt dark sugars, dried fruit and port, then sweetness gives way to lightening bitterness. Curiously, the overt spirit notes depart until right at the end, where theres a booziness thats mostly whiskey (with some vanilla, pepper and wood).

2656,"2013-07-01",2.8,"Poured from a 375 ml bottle into a tulip.

Opening this bottle I had to practically use a set of pliers to get the cork out. It is easy to tell even before I opened it that there would be no carbonation in this bottle. When I finally got it open and poured it aggressively, my fears were confirmed. The beer has an onyx black color with just a few stray bubbles that happened to form from the beer sloshing around in the glass.

Rich chocolate cake, bourbon, and brandy are all strong in the nose. Vanilla, roasted malt, and a bit of alcohol come through as well.

The flavors are unfortunately flattened out by the lack of carbonation. Each sip starts with dark and sweet chocolate, sweet bourbon, and brandy, with vanilla and roasted malt adding some depth in the middle. The end has a little jolt of alcohol, and the rest of the flavors really fall off into a watery finish. Again, the lack of carbonation leads to problems.

The mouthfeel is disappointing, mostly because it is totally flat. The beer has the thickness and complexity to warrant a nice, thick, viscious, and creamy mouthfeel, and it comes up way short. Instead, it feels thick and syrupy.

I imagine this could be an incredible beer if it actually had carbonation in it. Lesson learned - do not spend money on flat Lost Abbey bottles.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

That quality carries over to the flavor with the rich sweetness of bourbon and the dry fruitiness of brandy battling for supremacy, all while serpents stout occasionally pokes its head up.

A: Fizzing pour settles down with a brown mocha head. Lifting bubbles throughout. Perfectly opaque black. Clings to the glass with tiny hands.

T: Chocolate, coffee, and some oak. Has a pronounced tannic quality. Molasses and vanilla in smaller qualities. Theres more bitterness than I would have expected from the nose. Raisins and prunes. Lots of brandy. This becomes unpleasant and astringent after awhile.

M: Creamy and expansive. Lots of and lots and lots of alcohol.

Theres such a quality to all their brews, and I love the distinct flavor of their hoppy vs sweeter styles. That said, this is another stellar beer from them. Pours next to black with low tan head. Aroma is sweet, with raisin, figs, vanilla, hints of port and brandy and chocolate. Theres surprisingly little alcohol there. Taste has a very slight bitterness initially, before the sweet tones take over, and its not just one type of sweet but rather a complex mix of alcohol, dark fruit, vanilla and chocolate sweetness.

2656,"2012-12-02",4.5,"Bottle. I had a hankering for a hearty dark sweet beer, so I grabbed this from my cellar, even though I tend to wait and share these bigger beers with one or two other people. Im glad I kept this one to myself, because it was amazing. The pour was pretty standard: dark brown with a low brown head that floated its way to the end, never vanishing completely. Aroma was mouthwatering. with lots of chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and a bit of toasted coconut. Really delicious flavours that prominently displayed the barrel character; lots of oaky vanilla, sweet boozy bourbon, woody accents. But the base beer complemented and supported the barrel character easily, and the combination of generous rich dark malts with the brandy and bourbon was among the best Ive had. This beer demonstrates how barrel-aging can truly be something special. Outstanding.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

Appearance: The body is a nice pitch black with no head, rather a very thin and clean brown ring.

Taste: Whoa this is very complex, right away the fruits and thick syrupy chocolate intertwine while some brandy is noted, though mostly on the finish. The mid-taste is malty with only light hints of oak near the finish, with a mild burn of alcohol on the finish.
Palate: Thick and syrupy with just a light tingle.

2656,"2012-10-16",4.1,"375 ml bottle served in a snifter at Local Option. 2010 vintage split three ways.

A: Pours a dark black with opaque brown edges. No head forms on the pour, only a thin brown ring. Solid stick is left on the glass, but the carbonation is low.

S: The bourbon is more pronounced than the brandy, but it is still well integrated in a nice chocolate brownie and vanilla. There is a nice boozy prune and dark fruit smell that gets balanced by a nice roasted malt.

T: The taste is much more decadent. Fudgey brownie, figs, light bourbon, sweet vanilla and caramel with a touch of oak. The toasted malts are great. The finish is a meaty umami flavor just bordering on a mild soy sauce, but it really rounds it in a robust way.

M: Low carbonation with a heavy body. Sticky and coating with a nice viscosity. There is a slight warming on the backend, but it plays nicely.

O: Delicious. Decadent, rich and very complex. I really enjoyed the different layers of flavors. I havent had this fresh, but at two years its drinking remarkably right now.

2656,"2012-08-09",4.1,"In short: A corpulent chocolaty, caramelized, fruity and woody big dark beer.  Excellent sipper
How: Bottle 375ml.  A few times.  This rating for a bottles aged almost one year, slightly better than when fresh.
The look: Near black body with red highlights topped by a very small beige head
In long: Nose is a big fat fruity chocolaty cake, or maybe dark chocolate coasted fruits.  Whatever, it has fruits and chocolate, and it smells like a billions calories.  Decadent.  Taste is still the rich chocolate and the avalanche of fresh juicy fruits (raisins, fresh dark fruits and red fruits, sweet apples), but also a lot of nice vanilla beans.  Also some anise star spiciness.  There is quite a bit of wood in there and with the rich caramel bordering maple syrup, I had a maple wood sensation.  Finish is inexplicably relatively dry. This slightly aged bottle was less hot/boozy than the fresh bottle I first had and also it was a lot more homogenous.  From my experience this is not surprising with big heavy blended beers (the Sinners lineup comes to mind, especially the 09) where a fresh bottle really tastes like a bunch of different beers poured in one glass, but with a bit of time the blend becomes one beer.  The slightly aged bottle Im rating right now is a bit better than the fresh bottle I drank a while ago but I dont think this beer will benefit of any more aging.  This is now a cohesive beer and I dont see how it can improve.  An excellent sipper.  This Deliverance is an excellent blend, and I love beer blends, every night I blend 3 or 4 in my stomach.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Deep brown hue, bordering on black with a good sized beige head that leaves a healthy amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of brandy, alcohol, and roasted malt. The taste follows suit.

2656,"2012-06-13",3.7,"My rating for this beer is only as high as it is because of the aroma element of the score. Why do I keep buying from this brewer? The first beer I had was Angels Share, and it was infected and disgusting. The brewer pretty much told me to suck it when I suggested they consider compensating me in some small way.

Ok, on to this beer. I had my eye on this beer for months, but told myself ""No, I will not buy such a pricey beer that will certainly NOT be worth the cost. And besides, this brewer knowingly sells infected batches of their very expensive beer and then tells their customers to go....themselves when the beer is spoiled."" But....on a whim....as I stood there in the beer section....it called my named.......""Oh Miiiiichael......you know you want me"". So, like an idiot, thinking only with my palate, I fell for its charms.

Initially, I thought I had a winner. This things opened with only a slight hiss of carbonation from the bottle. Immediately putting my nose to the bottle I smelled....raisins. Not a bad thing. That usually means interesting things are in store for me. 

The pour was black...light does not return from this one. Head? There is really no head. Carbonation....only a tingle, really. The aroma....oh the aroma. I love the aroma of this one. Raisins, alcohol, soy, cherries, chocolate....on another day, I probably would get even more. I could sit and smell this for a while and be perfectly happy.

Taste.....ok, this was a surprise. I was expecting big things here. A big taste. I was pretty sure I would come down on the side of, ""Needs mellowing. Needs time in the cellar"". No way. This thing is subtle. If you go into it expecting to be blown away, you will be surprised. The flavors are all there; chocolate, bourbon, dark cherries, alcohol...no doubt more. But they are working together, and they are not going to smack you in the face. Youll have to take some time to notice them.

Ultimately, I think this is a pretty good beer, but it lacks something. Its simply not enough. I am left wanting something more from this. It is definitely unique. Its interesting. It has surprises. It is very expensive, but then most barrel aged beers are expensive. For me, the ultimate indicator is, would I buy it again...at $20 a bottle. Probably not. Certainly not in the next year.

I initially bought this to consider whether I wanted to age it. After trying it, I must say, it might get less interesting with age. I do not think that it needs mellowing. Its already mellow. Its done the aging thing already. Its ""thinner"" than I expected, and it does not need to lose mouth-feel.

See you in 5 years.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"

The aroma, I dont know how to describe it, I was completely blown away. Sweetness, molasses, alcohol, something peat-like, lots of dried fruits, some medicine and a touch of spicyness in a wonderful mix, making it quite hard to start tasting. And wheres the alcohol hidden? I can feel it in the mouth, theres some notes of vanilla in the flavor, revealing its bourbon ageing, but that 12.5% ABV is sure well hidden. Flavorwise, its equally as wonderful as the aroma, complex as hell, and damn its tasteful. The finish is more on the roasted side than the initial flavor, and lasts for ages. Super smooth, full-bodied and warming, its next to a sexual experience just feeling it swirl around, caressing the palate oh so softly and careful. Damn, Ive never been as close to a 4.7 before.

A - Pours black, mocha-colored head, thin film on top, spotty lace, thick collar.

T - Chocolate syrup on top of chocolate brownies with a small side of bourbon. Theres a touch of oak and vanilla in there as well. The alcohol bite makes the finish bitter and boozy, yet still remaining somewhat sweet.

M - Full, rich and smooth, good carbonation, creamy finish. Even after almost two years, this one is still quite boozy.

The flavor mimics the nose with an added sweetness that compliments the amazing bourbon finish. Palate is exceptional with mild carbonation and a nice velvety texture.

Aroma is way strong in brandy, wood, vanilla, raisins, molasses, bread--powerful, almost overbearing at first but it either mellows out or I got used to it. Taste is sweet, tart, and meaty with no bitterness. Absolutely packed to the fucking brim with flavor--seriously, theres no way they could have fit more into this little bottle. Licorice comes out pretty strong in the finish--almost Jagermeister-like in its impact on the palate. Carbonation is soft, body is obviously full, mouthfeel syrupy. This is one helluva beer.

Its a blend of bourbon barrel aged Serpent Stout and brandy barrel aged The Angels Share.

The flavor is immensely complex with brandy, chocolate, caramel, raisin, (big) plum, fig, date, pecan, leather, tobacco, vanilla, oak, rum, cardamom, and a touch of smoke.

The body is more silky than syrupy, and the carbonation is very soft and minimal.

With the smell you can definitely tell that the Angels Share took over this beer.  If I would guess on the blend I would say 75% AS and maybe 25% Serpents Stout.  Still its pretty damn unique and amazing.  The Brandy presence comes through nicely, mixed in with a butterscotch aroma, caramel, dark fruits, vanilla, and oak.  Small amount of booze.  Its lovely. 

Taste is just as good.  Its a nice and sweet taste.  Once again the inviting presence of butterscotch. Chocolate, Caramel, brown sugar, dark fruits, vanilla, bourbon, brandy, and oak.  Its complex.  The alcohol is more noticeable in the taste.  But sitting at 12.50% what do you expect.  Its a sipper.  Its to be enjoyed over a long period of time.

You can taste the two beers individually in each sip. When you take a sip you first are blasted with the brandy barrel-aged Angels share which is quickly soothed by the smooth texture of the bourbon barrel-aged serpent stout.

The flavour is moderately sweet throughout with roasted stout notes, figs and chocolate, along with bourbon, brandy, oak and raisins from the nose.

Flavor an incredible blend of these two beers that are both great on their own - the Serpents stout and bourbon really come through in the aftertaste.  Thick and smooth.  A great beer.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
2656,"2011-09-10",3.1,"Bottle poured into snifter.  Black, no head, a few bubbles around the edge 
of the glass.  Aroma is:  Bourbon, chocolate,  coconut, raisin and a tart wine like twang at the end. Flavor is: chocolate, coconut, bourbon, wood, booze.  It finishes with a tart brandy note.  This beer would be so much better without the brandy barrel.  I havent cared much for the double barrel aged beers.  Mouthfeel was a big let down, but I knew there was a chance for little to no carbonation.  More bubbles would have made this a much better 
beer too.  Dissapointing.","Pennsylvania, USA","McGrupp612"
2656,"2011-09-09",4.3,"Poured into a snifter. Thanks to PretzelCity for this.

3.5 A: Black color. One finger of creamy light brown head that has average retention given the ABV and leaves no lacing.

5.0 S: I personally didnt care much for regular Serpents and Im not a huge fan of any brandy barrel beer, but this combination is exquisite. The bourbon is a lot stronger than the brandy and the resulting intensity from each blends together almost perfectly. Anyway, the bourbon in this is smooth with a low booziness. Flavors include a good bit of leather, toastiness, a slight touch of peat, and subtle fruitiness. The brandy adds a nice vinous component. The barrels add a good bit of vanilla and oak. The underlying stouts lend a surprisingly soft roastiness with plenty of sweet caramel and molasses. A light sugariness with dark fruits and emphasis on plum and raisin. Very, very nice.

4.5 T: I dont know what this was like fresh, but at this point its quite smooth and the booze is well in check. Bourbon and brandy again work very well together. Ive had a few other bourbon + brandy beers and none of them have worked together at all, let alone as well as they do in this brew. Leathery bourbon with touches of peat and char. Woody, vinous brandy. Again good vanilla and oak. The base beers play second fiddle to the barrel treatments, but this is so good that I dont care (I usually do). Lots of caramel, molasses, and some brown sugar. Plum, raisin, prune, and tobacco fruitiness.

4.0 M: Medium to perhaps heavier medium body. Carbonation is a bit lower that what is typical for the style, but it works just as well. The problem is that this is missing the rich, velvety creaminess that I come to expect from beers of this nature. Very smooth though.

4.5 D: Best LA beer Ive had. I didnt think Id enjoy this nearly as much as I have, but Im glad I did.

Serving type: bottle

2656,"2011-08-30",2.8,"The most carbonated beer Ive had from LA in ages a frothy 2mm head after a vigorous poor. Its a solid brew. I no longer drop cash on LA myself- I figure if they dont care enough to fix the carbonation problem I dont care enough to drop the cash. I am still glad I received this beer as a toss in on a trade. If it was carbonated properly it would be a 5 Im certain. As delivered it is what it is: a 13 yr old boy- totally flat and loaded with potential.

I didnt really know what I was tasting at the time, but I certainly picked up on the combination of barrel aged stout and barleywine. I poured dark brown with a tiny bit of light setting off some ruby hues at the edges. Almost no foam. The aroma is caramel, heavy bourbon, raisins, and plum. The flavor is massive with lots of bourbon, raisins, and underlying notes of roasted malt. It changes with every sip sometimes giving off a more chocolaty impression.

2656,"2011-07-21",4.1,"375ml bottle thanks to Bradbalk. Pours black with a thin tan head. Aroma is huge roast, bourbon, vanilla, burnt sugar, ethanol, grilled stone fruit, sweet dark fruit, layers of chocolate, licorice and spice waft up with a gentle sniff. Flavor is bourbon, roast, chocolate and vanilla up front, waves of hot ethanol seep in toward the middle, without the bourbon notes they would be a little over the top, but that lovely oakey goodness helps to balance it out, finishes with dark fruit vanilla, alcohol, toasted sweet breads and dark, rich caramel. Palate is hugely heavy in body, creamy and slick on entry increasingly slick toward the dry, slightly boozy finish (again the bourbon notes save it here), throw in a light but noticeable carbonation and you have a delicious sort of black barleywine/imperial stout contraption.

The flavor opened with a syrupy foray of molasses and lesser maple, with bitter licorice, aged caramel, and vanilla settling onto the middle.. tangy oak, sweet bourbon, and black peppery alcohol around.. finished with more of the barrel and warmth, but neither got out of hand.

A: Yet another extremely black beer, however this one has some fantastic carbonation that sticks around throughout the journey! Wasnt expecting that since its barrel aged and a Lost Abbey beer. I am seeing some good lacing, thick and sticky.

S: Mmmm delicious bourbon my favorite. Getting some oak, vanilla, big O malt, maybe some leather, hints of brandy but the bourbon pretty much overpowers it. Definitely detecting chocolate too. Alcohol is prevalent but not overpowering to me, although I tend to enjoy the big boozy stouts.

T: Oh yeah, thats daddys medicine right there, love this! Getting the port wine brandy flavor and the bourbon aftertaste. Mild burn as it goes down but not too much. Definitely taste some vanilla but its subtle I only notice it after the beer fully coats and sits awhile. I am also getting some bitter chocolate but that could be the booze talking...

Luckily, I will be able to enjoy the whole bottle and instead of having to share the majority of the bottle with my floor.  Once poured, a beautiful beer fills my English pint glass with a dark mahogany liquid with a brown tint. There was a creamy yet delicate layer of foam head that lasted around throughout the drink.  As for the nose, a rich and robust scent of sweet sugary malt and earthy wood barrel dominate the aroma.  The palate is so smooth and gentle like a soft piece of velvet, but there is still a moderate level of carbonation. Flavors explode on the taste buds of my tongue and range from a mixture or earthy notes of wood barrel, vanilla, cocoa powder, maple syrup and a touch of sweet spice such as cinnamon. The finish is a rich aftertaste and leaves behind a trace of pumpkin pie.  This is truly delighting ale, and feel so lucky to have gotten to drink it.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

2656,"2011-04-12",3.7,"375mL bottle from a while ago (summer 2010?; Ive been slowly drinking through my Sinners allotment). Pours a deep, dark, cola-brown color; creamy, fine-bubbled light-tan head with modest retention and pretty damn fine lacing. Lots of alcohol present in the aroma, somewhat overshadowing the bitter chocolate, charred malts, and ash; layers of caramel and milk chocolate lurking underneath, but somewhat top-heavy with alcohol and burning. Full bodied; light carbonation; some immediate warming alcohol that doesnt quite trek into fusel land. In the mouth, the initial alcohol isnt as dominant, allowing the bitter and milk chocolate, caramel, burnt malts, and some red-fruit-centric vinous qualities to pop more overtly; the charred barrel character and spirit notes add a needed sharpness to whats otherwise dessert; Ive always really enjoyed this beer despite some of its rough edges; the Angels Share seems to be the more prominent part here, or at least the most forward one. Lasting, long finish of bitter chocolate, rich caramel, and some fine toastiness.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Pours pitch black and completely opaque with a one finger light beige head that quickly settles into a thick lasting ring. Minimal spots of lacing left behind.

Sweet boozy aroma with a strong barrel character giving off hints of boozy bourbon, earthy oak, vanilla, marshmallow and toasted coconut. Underneath there is some roasted malt with hints of oatmeal, dark chocolate, burnt toast and coffee bean. Im not picking up much brandy and its a bit booze heavy in the nose but it still smells pretty good.

Chewy full body that is pretty boozy with a nice balance of roasted malt, boozy bourbon and earthy oak. The barrel character is very prominent with a lot of dry, toasted oak balancing out the boozy sweetness. As the aroma suggests, there is more bourbon than brandy but Im at least picking up some brandy flavor. Faint vanilla and coconut smooth things out a bit but this beer is still plenty boozy. Underneath, there is a roasted malt backbone that compliments the dry, toasted notes of the barrel very nicely. Hints of dark chocolate, oatmeal, toast and deep roasted coffee/espresso bean linger into a long dry finish. Although this beer is slightly hot with plenty of warmth in the finish, the ABV is relatively well masked and the complex flavors make it very quaffable.

Overall, this beer was a very pleasant surprise. A lot of Lost Abbeys big beers and non-sours have been very disappointing lately with all of the QC issues but this was a very good beer. Plenty of carbonation and not syrupy at all. I found it to be complex and very tasty. Recommended!","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

A solid finger of medium tan head coms about but quickly fades to just a ring, no lacing...The aroma is really sweet, tons of vanilla and bourbon, reminds me of a lighter Angel Share Grand Cru. A hint of honey and oak adds depth on the finish. As it warms reminds me more of an aged BCS because the bourbon is a little hot...The taste nails the aroma, but in a lighter way. Vanilla is the main player here with accents of oak and bourbon. Really creamy and smooth, Im liking this way more than I thought I would and much more than the regular Angel Shares.

Pours a deep, dark brown - black in the glass - with a tan head. Ooooh - they may have redeemed themselves with this one. Tons on the nose - brown sugar, booze-soaked dark fruits, some chocolate, molasses, ginger (something like a molasses cookie), a bit of vanilla and oak, and burnt caramel. Seriously complex, and the blend of Serpents and Angels is working beautifully. Its boozy, for sure, but the flavor is pretty nice - roast counters dark brown sugar, and alcohol thins out the molasses quality.

Plums, raisins, crême brulée, maple syrup and caramel seep from this Black Barley Wines wealthy mouthfeel, as madeira and dark chocolate slowly rise in its truly inspiring flavor profile. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A thin ring of foam crowns the purplish dark brown.
-The controlled maderization in the aroma is spectacular with the raisin-y flavors of the specialty malts.
-Alcohol heat is felt throughout, but is never bothersome. It actually helps to offset some of the portly sweetness.
-The finish comes as a surprise, as the Imperial Stout used in the blend seems to suddenly take control.
-This is a beautiful example of what blended brews can offer. Of course, when the two original brews are this amazing, it helps... ;)

2656,"2011-01-18",3.2,"A very vigorous pour produces a one-finger thick, nicely browned, concentrated tan colored head in my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip.  The beer pours with a dark chocolate brown color that sits in my glass with an opaque, concentrated brown, almost black color.  The aroma smells of toasted coconut, vanillin, tart Bourbon, ample oak spiciness and warming, spicy, almost hot alcohol that even burns the nostrils a bit.  Rich, molasses like flavors mix with malty carob notes and a huge toasted whole grain character up front (though subservient to the Barrel notes), while the finish has a roasted, slightly acrid, aroma of burnt grain and a touch of brown sugar coated espresso beans.  A roasted nutty note starts tom come out with a bit of time.  There is almost a vinous quality to the nose (it is wrapped up in the tart barrel character), and now that I have noticed it, it almost seems like a lactic (or something similar, definitely not acetic) acidity, though this is fairly soft.  As the beer warms the spicy, hot alcohol becomes much more apparent in the nose.

Fairly thick and rich feeling, this is a beer with some definite viscosity to, this is backed by a slight, nicely supporting prickle of carbonation, that is on the light side for you average beer, but is just about perfect for this particular beer.  The beer has lots of Barrel derived flavors in the middle through to the finish and the long finish after a sip has a drying, dark chocolate bitterness and smooth burnt malt bitterness to it that lingers on the mouth with just a bit of char.  Up front there is an almost tart Bourbon, or perhaps Brandy character that melds into a toasted coconut and dense, creamy texture accentuating, vanillin flavor, and a big chocolate flavor in the middle.  The finish really, really reminds me of the after taste from a Bourbon, this isnt necessarily a good thing though as the finish is a bit hot, somewhat tart / vinous and has the spicy oakiness to it; because of this finish the beer seems to end a bit thin despite the rich, chewy body that is noticeable as the beer is in the mouth.  As the beer warms up it accentuates the harsher, hot alcohol flavors to the detriment of the rounder, more integrated lush characters that the beer had.

A nice beer, I like the complexity that it has, even if some of it can seem a bit dubious at times (the tartness can seem a bit out of place at times, even though I dont think this is in any way infected).  It does seem to prove out my growing feeling that beers over a certain alcohol percentage should not be Barrel aged as they get too hot and boozy (which this one does).  This would be quite the enjoyable beer in small doses; the first 2-4 ounces of this beer were much better than what the beer ended up being.  Still this is not bad, and even has its enjoyable moments.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2656,"2011-01-09",4.0,"375 ml bottle. This one pours a very dark mahogany brown color with hints of cherry red and crowned by a thin dark tan colored head of film. There is minimal spots of lacing left behind, but some nice staining sheeting that shows the viscosity of the brew. The aroma is really nice and is based in dark chocolate, toasted caramel, and rich toffee malts. Maple syrup, vanilla, and dark fruits lend further depth, while apple brandy sweetness and bourbon oak tie everything together. There is a hint of roast along with some warming from the alcohol. The flavors follow and are based in the dark chocolate and toasted caramel to go with some burnt oak and vanilla. Some earthen hops add a touch of bitterness on the back end. The bourbon adds a touch of toasted nuts, while the brandy barrel adds the signature caramel apples. Nearly full bodied and smooth with plenty of warmth from the alcohol while the balanced carbonation leads to a sticky sweet finish. Just a touch boozy with some warm cloying sugars is all that holds this back. Either way it is a really tasty brew that Im glad I have a couple more of.

Flavorwise..more bourbon, some wood, a bit of vanilla-laden sweetness but not overly so...pretty boozy though, actually..touches being hot at times yet the body seems a little thin at the same time...the finish is where this beer fails though....it kind of dwindles into wet cardboard and leaves unpleasantness in the mouth.  So..Id say a big boozy bourbon beer with a lighter than desired body and a finish of wet cardboard.  Well, that kinda sounds a bit worse than it actually is...but whatever, thats my forte.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"

Smell brings a lot, with brandy, bourbon, roasted malt, alcohol, dark fruits, and candied sugars all playing a role. Taste is quite similar, although everything isnt quite as integrated in that respect, and the alcohol heat plays a bigger role, which degrades a bit from the mouthfeel. Drinkability is very nice, as this is quite complex. I think age will absolutely do wonders to this one.

Aroma of deep chocolate, maple, molasses, raisin, wood, bourbon, raspberry, and heavily sweetened espresso.  Words cant express how good this smells, especially if you love desserty beers.  Flavor begins with a mix of bourbon, alcohol along with maple and thick, dark chocolate.  Espresso, brown sugar, raisin, berry, and brandy (along with plenty of heat) make themselves known soon enough.  Finishes a bit hot but continues the flavor overdose with chocolate, wood, heat, light char, and an overall sense of your mouth being enveloped in flavor.  Full bodied, a bit hot, thick and viscous, but this beer feels a little less heavy than expected.  Full flavor, YES.  But the alcohol presence does seem to make the beer thinner.  The carbonation is spot on for the style though.  Light, yet present enough to give the beer a sense of airiness, never calling attention to itself.  Just amazingly delicious overall though!

Pours a very dark brownish black hue, murky with a tiny frothy edges tannish head, dies to a mere ring. Carbonation track record leaves me a little wary. Aroma are rich and big, a ton of barrel off the bat, Bourbon, vanilla, hot spirit, sweeter brandy, sweet and bitter cocoa, caramel, toffee and some dark and dried fruits. Toast and roast come behind, sweet cocoa and creamy caramel mix with the barrel influence up front, which is heavier and present, but very nice. Initial is medium bodied, a big blast of warming spirit, Bourbon and Brandy, more bourbon I personally feel though, or at least it combats the sweeter influence of the brandy, dark chocolate both bitter and sweet, with caramel, toffee, vanilla, toast, biscuits and chocolate chip cookies, some decent roast, coffee grounds and lingering coffee with cream on the backend. What strikes me the most, aside from the barrel is the dark chocolate and bitter roast, coffee.. it seems as though the Serpent Stout portion takes the cake as far as dominance, with the more nuanced dark fruit, toffee, and brandy spirit seeping into the cracks. Granted, this speaks to the beers themselves, and maybe I just like the Serpents more, but it does take the dominance. Tasty, finish is roasty, spirit, wet oaky bourbon and brandy with lingering sweeter malts and coffee/dark chocolate.

The taste is similar with yummy caramel, rich prunes, some mild boozy harshness and rich near velvety chocolate (that seems to be at odds with the harsher notes). It seems the smooth chocolate comes out ahead in a struggle that reaches into the depths of the after taste. Wow! Yum. Need to get one of these to lay down in the cellar next to SeaBass (from cigar city).","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

2656,"2010-11-13",3.7,"Bottle: Deep brown nearly opaque with a small but lasting frothy beige head and spotty lace. The aroma has notes of coffee and cream, bakers chocolate, burnt sugar, walnuts, bourbon barrel (oak, vanilla, coconut, booze), and some red wine acidity. Smells is quite complex and makes me excited to try the first sip. The taste starts sweet and rich with lots of malty notes and over ripened fruit, nutty and roasty with a bit of a burnt tone midsection. The finish is brash bourbon and rum like, sort of a rum cake character. A bit of coffee and oak tannins help keep this from becoming cloy and overbearing. The mouth feel is sticky and lush with an aggressive warming and ashy woody aftertaste. While there are a lots of things to like about this beer, the parts are greater than the whole. I think more carbonation and perhaps some dry hopping could have made it more drinkable and rounded the palate. Additionally it does suffer from the same muddled blend character found in the Firestone Walker blended beers. All that said, hardly a drain pour and there were moments I did enjoy this concoction.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

2656,"2010-11-08",4.0,"The pour is nearly black with a dark tan, small, frothy head which does settles almost nothing and leaves some sporadic froth.  The nose is much like I remember the bourbon Angels Share and notes of sherry, weird; lots of rich toffee, burnt caramel, some molasses, sweet oak, a slight bourbon tinge, some fudge, vanilla, and faint grape skins.  The flavor gains some of the dark richness from the stout but retains the complexity of the BW; fudge is more prominent, still lots of molasses, vanilla, burnt caramel, faint burnt sweet oak notes, light anise, and faint raisins.  The palate is thick and viscous, warm, soft to lively, very full, but a bit syrupy.  The finish is still sweet and sherry-like with raisins turning grape-like, fudge remaining, warm bourbon oak, slight coffee notes emerging add just a hint of bitterness to counteract the borderline cloying sweetness.  All I can say is that you had better like them sweet with this one, so rich with only a minimal balancing bitterness.  This beer kept the complexity of the Angels Share and the richness from the Serpent but the oak notes seemed to be a bit diminished as well as the balancing bitter notes from the Serpent (i.e. bitter chocolate, toasted almonds, coffee roast).  And the palate seemed to be a combination of the super viscous stout with the syrupy BW, which could be nicer with a tad more carbonation.  I did find it interesting that when I compared the two original beers, I found quite a few similarities in tasting notes.  About what I expected... very complex, warming, thick palated, but ultimately just to sweet to be a great beer IMO.  Maybe something that would be fun see hold onto for five years and just see how complex it could become.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

2656,"2010-11-01",3.9,"375ml bottle, courtesy juiceisloose.  The pour yields a dark cherrywood to mahogany body with glints of deep red coming through when strongly backlit.  Just a tiny, dark khaki film with a thin edge shows at the head. Though minimal spotting remains behind on the glass, it is preceded by some dense, viscous, glass-staining sheeting, indicating the relative heft of the body.  Aromas are really enticing, based in a rich blend of fresh toffee, toasted caramel, and milk chocolate malts.  Maple syrup and vanilla deepen the decadence, as notes of apple brandy, wood, and bourbon lend complex, boozy intricacies.  Though primarily sweet, with little roast character, I must say that the nose is incredibly well pulled together and inviting.  Flavors arent as focused, as some of the alcohol begins to push forward and head off the underlying malts.  Sour mash bourbon brings hints of peanut skin, as the brandy brings boozy caramel-apple character.  Burnt toffee and semi-dry, milky chocolate are still there, but just dont seem as prominent as the nose would suggest.  There is some remainder hop bitterness, primarily earthen in character and not very prominent, but present nonetheless.  Moderately charred oak and vanilla both play a role.  On the palate, the body proves dense and warm, almost hot really, as the sticky sugars and warming alcohol work through the balanced carbonation.  The finish is a little too cloying for my liking.  Still, despite a few flaws, it is an overall fine beer that Id gladly imbibe again any time.  I must say that I prefer both Angels Share and Serpents Stout separately.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Bought 2 bottles at Whole Foods and got a sick Lost Abbey tulip glass for free. Thanks Jordan! Pours thick, jet black with brown hues, and a creamy espresso brown head. Nose is powerful; bourbon shines through with the brandy also being detectable, slight alcohol, chocolate, fig, raisin, and slight caramel from the malts with toasted coconut, vanilla, and oak from the barrels. The roasted malt from the Serpents Stout adds a nice layer in an already complex drink. The taste is bourbon, brandy, chocolate, caramel, and fig at first followed by toasted coconut, vanilla, more bourbon, and oak from the barrels.

Flavor is also boozy in the same way with more barrel notes (vanilla, wood), dark fruits (red grapes, plums), chocolate, and molasses.  Full-bodied, with mild carbonation and a thick, oily palate.

Aroma is awesome, it basically smells like AS, Serpent Stout, and bourbon barrel, I love what the hard roast and fruity notes of SS do to the AS, adds that complexity and backbone that I always though was missing from the regular brandy version, smooth and creamy, beautiful blend of bourbon, brandy, stout and AS, what a marriage, alcohol is harsh with some whiffs.  First taste seems to follow what I was expecting from the aroma, except it seems to fall apart from there, love the first taste of the roast and bourbon mixed with the AS, however, then it becomes very boozy, has that nice raisin finish and long lasting aftertaste though, but just very boozy with some roast bitterness.  Nice body, nice fizzy carbonation, just a bit gloopy after swallowing.  I have some more bottles so Im think age will really do this wonders... I think.   Right now it certainly tastes like a blend of two different styles rather than working together harmoniously to form a new beer.  I agree with Kan and Drew that the nod goes to the aroma.

Very small off-white head that fully diminished except for a small ring around the edge.  No lace.  Flavor is very sweet and bitter.  Palate is very full bodied and oily soft.  longer than average and slightly cloying finish.  Overall a very intense brew that showcases the bourbon and brandy upfront.  This does leave everything else in the background and I would have been more impressed if it was a bit more balanced in that respect.  I did enjoy this sipper very much so it is a good decadent brew.","Saginaw, Michigan, USA","polomagnifico"
2656,"2010-09-13",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2011 375ml bottle courtesy of freddy at bev4less. Thanks. Pours an opaque black color with a small tan head that soon fades to a fine ring. The nose is rich with molasses, dark fruits, whiskey and mocha. The flavor is complex with layered chocolates, brandy, raisins, dates, roasted malts and sweet molasses. The palate is smooth and malty with lively carbonation. The finish is long and semi-sweet. Overall: One of the finest big ales...ever.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"
2656,"2010-09-13",3.8,"So, in the last couple of weeks I have had this on tap at the brewery and in the bottle.   One thing is certain, this is a boozy beer.   Super hot.  The aroma is so boozy that with the strength of the beer, you almost feel like your drinking a glass of brandy. Carbonation was perfect.  Maybe its just me, but I cant say that there is anything here that particularly stands out.  Kind of reminds me of the BA version of Santas little helper.","Poway, California, USA","Naven"
2656,"2010-09-13",3.7,"375 ml corked and caged bottle poured a clear dark brown with a lingering ring of tan foam. Aromas of brandy, burnt carmel, raisin, toffee, light oak and light vanilla. Palate was medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of carmel, brandy, toffee, oak, raisin, plum and bourbon with a smooth dry lingering roasty fruity finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
2656,"2010-09-12",4.6,"Almost black. Bourbon, vanilla, raisins, butter toffee, toasted oak aroma.  Creamy mouthfeel. Rich vanilla and bourbon flavors. Smooth and a bit more mellow than I expected. Delicious!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
2656,"2010-09-11",4.1,"This was a fine beer - I suggest holding on to you bottle for a little bit though if you can.  Pours dark brown with a small head.  Nose of brandy, bourbon, wood, toffee, chocolate, caramel.  It is a little hot still, but a damn fine beer.  Thick and sweet, good caramel, coffee, and booze.  Well done.","","User29624"
2656,"2010-09-10",4.0,"A: The pour is black and ominous with a fingers worth of mocha colored foam that eventually settles down to a thin cap.

S: Plenty of vanilla is present immediately along with a nice chocolate notes, of both dark and semisweet varieties, combining nicely with some roast from the Serpents Stout. The two spirits (brandy and bourbon) work together nicely without either really being all that noticeable. A bit of a wood and alcohol note as well.

T: The sweet chocolate flavor (almost cake-like) and vanilla come through wonderfully and are the first things I pick up. The wood, bourbon, and subtle flavors of roasted malts provide a bit of a balance to the sweetness. More sweetness to follow with some caramel and brown sugar.

M: The body is medium to full with a mellow carbonation that provides for a creamy mouthfeel.

D: As I finish entering my notes I realize that Ive probably already had about 12 ounces of this beer. Again, the pint was not entirely necessary for such a beer, but for less than the price of one of the 12 ounce bottles, I wont complain too much.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2656,"2010-09-08",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 4, 2014 dark brown near black.  smell amazingly complex vanilla, chocolate, roasted malt, a touch of brandy and ripe fruit.  super duper smooth.  head to head with a 6 month old Angels Share grand cru, and this one is not as hot, although its definitely a sipper.  one of the best sippers actually.  best of both brews.  gotta do a head to head with a regular old serpent stout to determine my favorite lost abbey beer.  wish they were reasonably priced, though.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
2656,"2010-09-08",4.0,"12.7 oz bottle. Great label art! Opened with a slight (very) pop. Pours with a small bit of carbonation that mostly dissipated quickly.  Solid black. Nose is very boozy with a touch of chocolate. Taste: very  sweet and a bit sticky but not over the top. Alcohol is definitely present all the way through. Its a bit young and I believe this will settle down and be better a few month from now.","Seattle still not near Beersel., Washington, USA","bleeng"
2656,"2010-09-08",4.3,"Very dark molasses pour with a creamy thin latte head.  This brew has some legs.  Aroma of caramel, brown sugar, raisin, oak, and bourbon.  Flavor is assertive but not aggressive, with a nice balance between the original flavors and the barrel.  Vanilla, dark fruit, wood, cocoa, and bourbon all make their way to the palate.  The alcohol is there but isnt distracting.  Definitely a sipper but a really good one.  Just the right level of carbonation to ignite the palate.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
2656,"2010-09-06",3.3,"First off, I smelled booze the second I uncorked this one...pour is murky black with a thin sticky tan head...smell is then pretty overwhelming...cocoa, vanilla, wood, booze, alcohol, heat, sweetness...I mean wow...this is certainly barrel aged...and holy shit the sweetness...the first thing I taste is grapeskin and fruit...bitter and sweet...then a hint of chocolate and BAM...alcohol....the brandy comes out in the fruity flavors but bourbon is just overpowering...hot and sweet sweet sweet...there is a lot going on here but none if it is particularly good...this is just all over the place and not really in the good way...finish is lingeringly boozey and sweet...I have to say that this idea sure was a fun experiment to drink, but all of these things going on at the same time was a bit offending to the palate...neat idea none the less...","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
2656,"2010-09-05",4.4,"375ml bottle. Pours deep dark brown with minimal head.  The nose is sweet brandy, toffee, brown sugar, molasses and milk chocolate.  The taste is smoky wood, vanilla, burnt caramel, ashy cocoa, roasted malt, dried dark fruits and light bourbon tones.  Medium semi-creamy mouthfeel with some prickly carbonation on the tongue.  Theres a lot going on in this beer - very tasty brew for sure.  Warming on the belly but the booze is well hidden in the flavor.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","Sparky"
2656,"2010-09-04",4.6,"pours opaque murky brown to black with a 3mm creamy, dark brown head. nice lacing, nice legs, spot on carbonation leaves a skim and a ring and an easy swirl re-stirs a nice layer. aroma is quite boozy, especially colder. as it warms lots of raisins and prunes and figs with burnt molasses hit you up front, with a slightly sweeter caramel in the finish from the AS. the taste is very complex and also very well balanced. i am getting both beers coming through strongly and working in perfect harmony. the barrel profile between the two is quite intense and large. i really enjoy it but think that it may be detracting from the true complexity of the mix just a touch. there is sweet, lighter malts of the As and roasty dark malt of the SS, some nice bittering hops and light floral additions from both beers hop profiles. it has a nice sweet oily spirit like quality from the as and a creamy aspect added in from the SS, very nice the body. this is really a great blend, it allows both beers to shine and is just as tasty as either of them on their own, a truly righteous concoction.","Notown, California, USA","wavers1"
2656,"2010-09-04",4.1,"Boozy chocolate aroma. Raisin. Plumb. Very rich and intense. Lots of roast here. Some subtle sweetness. I need to try one side by side with Angels Share to see how the blend differs. From memory, it tastes like a better Angels Share. Perfect end of the evening beer.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
2656,"2010-09-04",4.4,"Pours a thick viscous deep brownish black with a light brown head and a real purty mouth. Aroma is brandy, oak, bourbon, chocolate, caramel, toffee, butterscotch, roast. Flavor is roast, caramel, brandy, oak, tannins, bourbon, spices, molasses, brown sugar, chocolate. Tiny effervescent carbonation bubbles battle their way through the viscous body of the beer bring out nuances of this blend at the tip of your tongue, especially the barrel, oaky tannins, bourbon and brandy while the caramel and butterscotch sweetness melds in harmony with the booze in the back of your tongue. This is a great blend.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Rusty"
2656,"2010-09-02",4.1,"On tap at the brewery.  Thick, opaque black, and very viscous with a very thin dark brown head.  Strong, boozey aroma with dark roast, deep caramel, vanilla, and toffee.  The booze comes through quite assertively in the flavor as well, but is intermingled with dark malt, alcohol, barrel oxidation, and some nicely integrated sweetness.  It all comes together very well in the body.  Make no mistake: this is a big beer with huge alcohol and malt.  But thats the point.  And this beer pulls off just such an M.O.  better than most.  This is classy stuff that will certainly only improve with age.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"
2656,"2010-09-02",3.5,"On tap at Deliverance release. Pours a rich dark brown with small tan head. Aromas of bourbon and rich dark malts, a hint of smokiness. Mouth feel is thick with moderate carbonation. Flavors of dark fruits, some oak. Finishes a little hot, great beer however may taste better once it settles out a bit.","Northridge, California, USA","brianjames1"
2656,"2010-08-31",4.4,"A full pint enjoyed at the brewery ($8).  Pours black with a thin layer of brown foam.  Aroma is mellow with lots of woody barrel notes -- bourbon and brandy...check; also vanilla, chocolate, and marshmallows.  Flavor is surprisingly ultra-smooth and also complex with notes of silky rich chocolate, marshmallows, vanilaa, oak, sweet-boozy, bourbon, and molasses.  Good carbonation...an unfortunate concern with Lost Abbey these days but this is nicely carbonated.  It is on the sweet side but pleasant and far from cloying.  This is sufficiently different from both the Angels Share and Serpents Stout as to completely stand on its own...sure I could try to pick out the elements of the component beers but that would take away from the pure pleasure of this fantastic blend.  Really great stuff...Im loving the complexity of these dark Lost Abbey beers.  (11, 370)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"
2656,"2010-08-28",4.1,"Draft at the brewery.  Thick black pour, short dense tan head.  Chocolate, dark fruit, oak, lots of vanilla, bourbon, brandy, molasses, and toffee.  This was thick and chewy, mostly sweet malts.  Very good.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
2656,"2010-08-28",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 29, 2010 On tap at the Release. Pours with a near black body with a huge lasting tan head. Big woody, chewy nose: burnt, toffee, vinous, and very rich. Molasses. Taste is rich, very rich, burnt, alcohol, brandy, bourbon, chewy goodness, vanilla, wood. Lively bubbles. Thick. Wrong weather, but great beer!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
2656,"2010-08-23",4.0,"On draft at Lost Abbey for Pre-Stone 14th anniversary breakfast. Poured a cola brown with no head. Aroma was bourbon, grass, and oak. Taste was bourbon, chocolate, raisins. Medium carbonation. Overall very good. Easier to drink than angel share alone!","Lake Arrowhead, California, USA","JoeTheYounger"
2656,"2010-08-22",4.3,"Tasted at the Stone Anny fest. Dark brown black hues with minimal tan top. Roasty malty aromas. Medium full body. What a fantastic blend and combo of these two beers. The coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and molasses of Serpents intertwine perfectly with the bourbon, heat, and caramel of Angels. Great complexity of flavors obviously. Finish is long lasting sweet and very tasty. Great beer!!","encinitas, California, USA","nightrider"
2656,"2010-08-22",4.1,"Draft at Stone 14th. A total hybrid of the two constituent beers, the Serpent Stout is apparent on the initial mouthfeel and roasty malt character, but the Angels Share takes over with a boozey, dark fruit, caramel profile that lingers into the sweet and warming finish with woody tones throughout, great blend!","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"
2656,"2010-08-22",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 22, 2011 Served (on tap I think) at the Stone 14th Anniversary Celebration. The appearance is a cola brown without a lot of head. The flavors and aromas are brandy, raisin, spicy oak, vanilla, heavy roasted flavors. A really good beer that will be even better with some time on it.

Served out of the bottle with about a year on it (batch 1). The appearance is a deep midnight black with a small brown head. Dried dark fruits, barrel, Flavors of raisins, dates, booze, brandy barrel, chard oak, some peppery spice, vanilla. Very boozy, this hasnt changed much from what I remember of the first time.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"
2656,"2010-08-21",4.4,"On tap at source, #4! 
Appearance:  Pours a viscous dark brown with a faint oily swirl on top.

Aroma: Big bourbon sweetness and some bourbon soaked dark fruit.

Taste: Burnt roast, char,caramel, warm alcohol, coffee, with some spicy hops at the tail end of the sip. The flavor lingers well past the sip.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, prickly pronounced carbonation.

Overall:  Simply amazing. The burnt roast notes balance out the bourbon/Angel Share goodness into one of the most solid balanced bourbon barrel aged strong ales Ive had.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"
2656,"2010-08-21",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 11, 2010 8/21/10 - Free sample after squealing like a pig at the brewery.  Thick and heavy on the angels share with vanilla, date, and slight spice.  Definite sipper.  Minimal bourbon and a nice chocolate/cocoa dryness at the end of the finish.  Heavy but not overwhelming and definitely not overly sweet nor syrupy.  Somewhat creamy in the middle.  Great beer and Im quite curious to see how it tastes a few years from now.

9/11/10 - rerate from a bottle.  I get a little more bourbon on the nose but it mostly strikes me as AS.  More fresh bourbon in the taste than I recall from on tap.  Some raisin, wet chocolate, and sharp alcohol in the finish.  Preferred it more on tap. (-.1 on the palate and taste each).","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"
