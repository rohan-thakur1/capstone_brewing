4260,"2017-06-21",4.1,"Pour is ruby brown with tan head. Aroma is big and fruity, raisins almost bordering on muscat notes. Initial palate is a big boozy hit with fruit, spice and a myriad of other flavours. Finish is slightly grippy from tannins and a bit acidic. It is big and brilliant.","Bentleigh, AUSTRALIA","Dredd"
4260,"2017-03-05",4.0,"Dark red with off-white head. Red wine, barrels and flemish red. Sweet, woody, slight acidic and spicy finish. The malt brings new flavors to this wine. Very interesting and groundbreaking.","Oslo, NORWAY","aleksander9"

4260,"2016-07-16",4.0,"Tasting flight at garage project. Matched with bourgonville bar. The red wine comes through surprisingly well in this beer. The nose has the faint yet distinct aroma. Medium body with a mild tannin after taste.","Palmerston North, NEW ZEALAND","Samtzu"
4260,"2016-07-09",4.1,"Darkish color comparable to grape juice. But it is essentially a pinot noir clone with less acidity thanks those beer malts. A weird frakenstein monster.","NEW ZEALAND","Hoponmate"
4260,"2016-07-09",4.3,"650ml bottle. Dark with little head. Starts with malts and finishes with pinot noir. I dont mean a hint of pinot noir, I mean pinot noir. Absolutely stunning.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","explosivedog"
4260,"2016-06-29",3.7,"[8379-20160529] Bottle. Very, very wet oak aroma. Black body with red hues and a quick foamy off-white head. Red wine and oaky wine barrel and then even a little more woody oak in the flavour. Medium body is quite smooth and lovely. Very tasty but all oak and wine. (7/3/8/4/15) 3.7

4260,"2016-06-26",3.3,"2016-05-29. Dark brown body, nice beige head fades. 3+ Aroma is intensely oaky, with a boozy vinous red wine character that smacks you in the face on first sniff. Flavour has similar strong red wine and oak character. Lovely mix of malt and red wine below. Vanilla oak grows as you go on. Smooth average bodied palate, low carbonation. 3+ Some lovely moments but the rich oak character is overpowering for me. 6-7/3/7/3/14 2015 Vintage bottle at Garage Project - Aro 91, Wellington, NZ.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
4260,"2015-01-15",3.5,"An interesting concoction. Red in color. Full of grape and vinous flavor. Sweet. Fun. One is enough for me, though.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
4260,"2014-08-18",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Black pepper, earth and black grapes coalesce over this creative crews enjoyable bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the deep chestnut brown.
-Alcohol is well hidden.
-The mouthfeel is once again silky, a recurring theme in what I know of their lineup so far.
-The flavor profile is cohesive.

4260,"2014-08-01",3.9,"A lovely beer that has charm and character. Dare I say a lager that I like? The addition of the noir from Escarpment (one of NZ finest) makes this a beer to savour.","NEW ZEALAND","omega"
4260,"2014-06-27",3.3,"ok, I thought this started off really strongly and then didnt have the legs to carry it. But it is a nicely mellow and enjoyable beer that is neither sharp or bitter, neither is it too sweet or cloying. I dont know what a wine drinker would think of this. Overall its enjoyable and makes a really pleasing change to over-hopped beers that I could be drinking.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","Pdubyah"
4260,"2014-06-26",3.8,"This beer was a surprise and I am pleased to report it was a pleasant surprise. Gorgeous red mahogany colour with a cream coloured head and an aroma of red-grape juiciness. The flavour was dominated by the juiciness of the pinot noir, which was sweetish without being cloying and endearing - like a favourite niece. Not the most lengthy finish, but I would have happily gone back for seconds if time allowed.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
4260,"2014-06-17",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 18, 2017 Delicious companion brew to their white wine version - Sauvin Nouveau. I prefer that one - but would be happy drinking this one otherwise.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
4260,"2014-06-14",4.0,"Very nice. Smells slightly fruity but thats less exciting than the taste. It starts off very beery, dark malt, but sidles quickly into slightly sharp winey fruit, unsurprisingly not unlike a very young pinot noir. The experience ends with chocolate bitterness that lingers amongst the grape. Enjoyable, and not just for the mutant wine-beer value.","Dunedin, NEW ZEALAND","inceptioj"
