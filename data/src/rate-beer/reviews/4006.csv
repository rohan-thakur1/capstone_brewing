Some spicy, slightly herbal hops and garlic, too. Much maltier flavor. More like a hoppy porter than IPA. Tree bark, pine, toast, a good amount of chocolate, nougat, a touch of charcoal. Whipped, soft body is like a fleece blanket. Light carbonation; soft bitterness. Very flavorful. More like a hoppy porter than a black IPA.","","PartyFowle"

4006,"2013-10-20",3.8,"22 oz. bottle thanks to Phatdog1 thanks buddy!! Pitch black with thin off white head. Aroma is a great blend of mix of the roast char malt, fresh pine and citrus hops. The flavor is balanced perfect with rich chocolate malt along with the pine and citrus/ grapefruit hops. This cant be 10%, no way!! ABV masked extremely well. The bitterness is lightly lingering and mellowed out by the rich roasted notes. Really tasty.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

Pours nearly black, cola brown, with an average tan head that slowly recedes to fairly thick, rocky lace. The nose is full of green resin and pine hops, with a nice combination of dark and milk chocolate, with a bit of a creamy note, and plenty of roast. The flavor is more focused on the chocolate and roasted notes, with the resinous hops taking a back seat.

4006,"2013-07-20",4.4,"Poured into a pint glass out of a 22oz bomber.

Pours pitch black with a very solid two finger tan head. Amazing head retention that leaves behind very stout lacing. Very impressive.

Aroma of pine and some citrus along with grass, orange peel, and smoke. Coffee and roasted malt are underneath but marry perfectly with the pine and citrus hops. There is also a dark fruit, port-like quality.

The flavor brings out more of the stout characters with coffee and roasted malt but the hops are still very much forward. Pine is quite prominent but is solidly supported with orange and pineapple. Some chocolate rushes in late along with a moderate to high bitterness. One complaint I do have is that the malt flavor is a little soft and falls off too quickly. Still, the alcohol is well hidden and the beer is not too sweet.

Overall, a very nice Black IPA and quite drinkable for being so strong. Another hit in the dank tank series from Sweetwater.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

The aroma is roast, touch of char, and a nice full fresh pine and citrus hoppiness.  The taste is a pleasant mix of the roast char malt, and the pine and citrus hoppiness.  The citrus turns a bit towards the sweet side of the spectrum, particularly in the longish finish.  The palate is medium bodied, soft carbonation, and the sweet finish.

4006,"2013-05-15",3.7,"Bomber from Bruisin. I was very excited to see that Sweetwater has tackled a black IPA since they use hops so well. I was a little let down as Some Strange doesnt come close to having the hoppy punch that Happy Ending does. This is a malt forward beer, maltier than their imperial stout even. Aroma has hints at grapefruit, rum, toffee, earth. While the flavor has a fair amount of hops, Im not sure that its enough to really make this identifiable as a black IPA. The palate is pretty heavy and a little alcohol heat comes through. Its not a bad beer, there are good flavors of roasty coffee, earth, subtle grapefruit in a big, heavy body. I just want more hops from the style.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

I pick up roasted coffee, silky chocolaty notes, a touch of toffee, and resinous hops.  Definitely more coffee and chocolate in the flavor with the hops more subtle than expected.
