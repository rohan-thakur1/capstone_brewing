3073,"2017-05-25",3.7,"500ml bottle at the 2017 Cambridge Beer Festival. Dark mahogany/brown and translucent. Fair bit of carbonation but very little resultant head. Heavy smoke on the aroma but there is also a good dollop of chocolate malt. The bitter taste perseveres to the finish. Its far from subtle but lovely nonetheless. Blackberry, burnt sausage, bitter chocolate and yest extract combine in the ambrosial aftertaste. A great beer, maybe a bit heavy for what it is but I expected that! Delicious.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"

3073,"2017-01-21",4.5,"500 ml bottle bought at Running Beers booth at HKCEC in Wan Chai during The 14th Hong Kong Food Festival.
Looks: Clear deep copper brown colour; Two-finger head with crumpety light beige foam which lasts for 4 minutes; Excellent sticky lacing with fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant full smoked malt, with well-done bacon, caramel, toast, strong cherry, wood, floral, strong molasses, dark bread, lemon and grass.

Taste: Medium sweet dark malt, with strong ash, fair bacon smoke, strong herbal tea, burnt caramel, burnt toast, floral, molasses, earth, dough, dry biscuits, lemon, strong bitter hops and sharp grass. Impressive!

Body: Medium body; Dry and quite slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Full dark maltyness in a solid background. Smokiness got intensified as beer warms - ashy, sooty with light touch of bacon - followed by burnt caramel and intense liquorices which closely resembles Chinese herbal tea, with unmistakably strong sweet-bitterness which is a real surprise. Sweetness is moderate, about the same level as Rauch Maerzen. Earthy and dry biscuity with lemon to round. What a nice trip really!

Hoppiness: Wood, floral, lemon and grass in nose. Strong herbal tea, floral, earth, lemon, strong and sharp grass in taste; Bitterness is very strong herbal for a lasting, high astringent burnt malty finish.

After Taste: Dry. Immensely herbal and very strong bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one is more than just a level-up version of Rauch Maerzen: nice bacon aroma, full and intense burnt malt, with equally strong Chinese Herbal Tea which reminds me of the City Brews 24 Flavors Black IPA I had not long ago. Every element balances each other for a very hoppy-toasty-burnt finish. This is a trip I wont forget anytime soon. Absolutely fantastic!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Fresh 2016 Bottle, October 2016: I can appreciate Schlenkerla much more by now. What I wrote above is still correct - compared to the Märzen, its fuller, sweeter, creamier and chewier, but also a bit more ashes in the finish. It is exactly like youd want a Schlenkerla bock to be, though. Also, full pours look better than small pours from bottle shares. Hopefully Ill still make it to Bamberg for a gravity pour of this before theyre out again!

3073,"2015-10-27",3.7,"Treated as a rauchbier, this was poured into a mug.
The appearance was a semi-hazy to dark brown color with an off white foamy head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds yet still leaving a soft level cap of a white head with just a tad of lacing roaming around in a messy sort of way. 
The smell started off with sweet honey blending with subtle smoke and bringing in a slight meatiness (more so like a glazed ham).
The taste was mainly the same sweet flavor from the aroma encompassing a subtle bacon derivative sliding smoothly into the aftertaste and leading on into a sticky finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the meatiness to blend more with the sweetness thus creating a stickiness on my tongue. But, its a good stickiness.

3073,"2014-11-03",4.6,"Pours a lovely dark amber with a distinct dark ruby cast that is slightly darker than their Marzen variant . Good head, lacing and retention. Outstanding nose of meaty bacon like smoke against an underlying dark fruit (plum, fig) note over a slightly sweet base. Medium body with a creamy slick texture. Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish. Compared to their Marzen variant, Urbock has slightly less head characteristics, slightly more carbonation and more body and texture. The superb flavor profile is even more outstanding in that it obtains a higher degree of balance by being slightly sweeter and coats the tongue with a slick layer of bacon like smoke. The flavor profile is a masterpiece of intensity, balance and complexity. The delicious smoke character is always present, but never overpowering. It begins with a campfire bacon like smoke over a moderately sweet background that has dark fruit characteristics. The middle allows the hops to impart a low level bitterness that has a citric note as it effervesces. The finish is less dry than the Marzen, somewhat crisp, slightly sweet and leaves you with a touch of dark fruit and a lingering smokiness as if youve sitting around a campfire.

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a color brownish copper color with some light ruby highlights seen shinning through. Upon pouring there is a two finger tan colored head that has a about a 3 min retention time before fading and leaving some light lacing on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  Big on the smoke and the char with some undertones of brown bread and caramel. There are also aromas of char and some meaty smells mixed within giving it a nice campfire like aroma.

 Taste  The taste of some darker malts as well as a nice strong smokiness are initially present upfront. Some lighter dark fruit flavors mix with these giving it a moderately taste. The sweetness intensifies a bit as some flavors of caramel come to the tongue. A salty flavor joins the mix more toward the end while the beadier and malty flavors begin to fade. IN the end with the smokiness increasing slightly, a cured but moderately sweet smoked taste is left on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average to just above average side in terms of its thickness with a carbonation level that is overall rather average, both suiting well the blend of smoky and sweet.

 Overall  Lightly sweetened BBQ taste in a glass here. Roasted, smoked with a bit of char, sweet and delicious.","","Darkmagus82"

3073,"2014-07-16",4.0,"Apparently the winter version in this fascinating series, again with the Bamberg smoked malt. Pale beige, creamy, sticky foam, colour an opaque brown with a copper hue, only visible under bright light; nose gets the same wave of smoked meat and charcoal as in the better-known Märzen version, but this time it gets more, as hints of bitter chocolate, liquorice and caramel shine through. The taste is even more surprising, as the caramel- and chocolate-like malty sweetishness dominates the first sip, only to be abruptly broken by the salty, bone-dry smokiness which lingers on till deep in the finish, which also reveals some spicy hops.

3073,"2014-02-24",4.4,"Ive had this take on a smoke beer before. I dont remember much in the way of the nuances but I do remember enjoying it. I had it while defiling a womans kitchen in Fairlawn, NJ. I was attempting to rewrite the physics books and fit 20oz of tomato bits and thick cream into a pot that had no business holding half that amount. I digress I found this beer again at the West Over Market in Arlington VA where every beer is gratuitously inflated. This didnt stop me. When I opened it the beers froth erupted from the top and only stopped when I poured it into my glass. The initial head is impressive albeit short lived. Aroma itself is a feast, a cornucopia of rich and malty aromas. This beer is robust. Bacon, campfire smoke laced with oak and maple make this a righteous beer to sip on. It reminds me of crisp winter nights sitting next to the fire pit till 4am. Versatile beer when it comes to food pairings. Optimal pairing would be with a glazed Cornish game hen and a significant other. Thoroughly impressed with this one.","USA","JOHNCONOR"

3073,"2014-01-02",5.0,"500ml bottle, one very similar to the Märzen, except of course now with the Urbock designation. A picky 6.5% ABV on this offering, at that. This beer pours a clear, dark caramel-tinted brown hue, with two fingers of lazily puffy, mildly creamy, and mostly bubbly true beige head, which leaves a bit of streaky remote islet lace around the glass as things slowly sink away. It smells of gamey smoked meat, bready smoked caramel malt, gritty smoked Gouda, generic campfire ash, and more isolated, well, smoke (the thesaurus having duly failed me here). The taste is still big and over the top smoky, sure, but now at least one can discern the caramel malt backbone and singed leafy hops amongst the still heady simmering bacon and infused cheese acridity. My mouth silently cries out for an ashtray. The carbonation is agreeably involved, but just enough to keep things lively and on the go, the body a somewhat tacky medium weight, and much more smooth than I might have proffered had I been asked at the onset of this affair. It finishes strangely off-dry, the now biscuity caramelized (and smoked, don't ever be forgettin' the smoke!) malt hanging tough, as does the lingering assaulted noble hops, all still under the yoke of the moderately overbearing smoky notes. Uber alles, this does seem to have a bit of a lighter, booze-lifted essence, that is at once reminiscent of Bocks and actively burning beechwood fires. Still, one hell of a sturdy, gritty, and of course eye and palate-watering smoky deal. Veritable truth in advertising, that cannot be denied, and if there was any homeland beer that Rammstein should hold close to heart, it would be this.

3073,"2012-12-27",4.2,"Reviewed 11/07/2012. 16.9 fl oz bottle poured into a straight glass.

A: Pours a dark burgundy color with nice clarity. It looks a little thin pouring down into the glass. The head is a two finger mocha color with moderate retention. Theres a lot of spiderweb lacing left down the glass.

S: Very strong smokiness - not just in a woody motif, but reminiscent of ham when taking its mild sweetness into consideration. There is a caramel backbone behind it all, but it takes a bit of hard work to discern it through the smoke. Its a damn good aroma - one that permutes into something slightly more chocolaty as further whiffs are taken - with the only real detractor being a slight note of plastic.

T: As expected, smoky meat opens the flavor profile, before turning into vaguely sweet caramel maltiness after the midtaste. The plastic in the aroma is nearly nonexistent in the taste, thankfully. I kind of expected this to be a little more heavy handed than the marzen version, but its actually just as subtly flavored, if not more so. The main difference here is a slightly chocolaty finish. Its not too sweet nor too bitter, just balanced to near-perfection. Like their marzen, its one of the most complex lagers Ive ever savored, with multiple layers of flavor - like dried fruit and grassy hops - revealing themselves behind the main show of smoked malts.

M: Smooth and a little syrupy, but easy to drink. Very creamy up until the wet, almost decadent finish. Actually, it isnt that easy to drink, if only because its something that should be savored rather than chugged.

O: I am convinced that Schlenkerla is starting to spoil me with their rauchbiers. Take it from a man who normally dislikes bacon - this is excellent.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Aroma is full of smoke, smoked ham, a little wood, slight caramelly and chocolaty sweet malty notes. As expected. Taste is surprisingly subtly smoked, its not overpowering or coating in any sense. First up theres caramelly dark malt, then some slight, balancing bitter hoppy notes in the middle, finishing with a campfire smokiness that lingers in the mouth for quite a while. Very nice.

It is nice that way as the smoke is secondary to a smooth highly drinkable beer.

A: Dark walnut hue. When held to the light, the beer becomes more transparent and I notice the slow ascension of bubbles throughout the glass. There is an off white head that recedes to a quarter inch and holds steady, leaving a healthy amount of lacing on the glass.

S: This aroma defines rauchbier, in my opinion. Smoke, campfire, burning meats, summer sausage, roasted malts. The scents are absolutely fantastic.

T: The taste does not disappoint. Fabulous smoky taste, with a salami or sausage flavor in there, as well. This is to beer what Lagavulin is to single malt scotch. Everything is balanced so well - this is a pleasure to drink. This beer is perhaps the perfect pairing with a meat and cheese spread.

Appearance is a dark brown/ruby hue with a thin slightly off white head.  Aroma of bacon/ham, smoked wood, burnt ash, also a light bit of sweetness, smells fantastic.  Taste is really freaking good.  The smoke is nice and balanced between the mixture of smoke and sweet.  Its surprisingly smooth for the style, also a very faint bit of dark fruit/plum taste.  This doesnt beat out the fresh marzen that I enjoyed straight from the brewery, but this is a pretty damn close second.

It smells like the smoked applewood bacon I like, with some sweet wood and apple notes. Pungent and smoky for sure, but its not overbearing, and a sweet fruity maltiness lurks underneath it all. Layered and complex. The taste is surprisingly laid-back. The smoke is there, but theres a barbequed pork sweetness that is more front and center than the smoke. Its a nice balanced between smoke, meat, and light bready malt. More meat through the finish, and a touch of spicy, warming heat. Slick in the mouth, with a medium body and lively carbonation.

So strong smoked aroma: it recall food, from bockwurst to smoked provola (cow cheese from South of Italy). And ashes, burned wood, cinder, dark fruits, dried fruits (almonds, nuts, walnut). Body is sugary, but malty and pleasantly full of burned wood and roasted malt. Caramel, vanilla, dark fruits again. Mid carbonation, link the sweetness of the bock with the sharpness of the smoked and its a really good marriage. Bitter finish. I remember a freshier one and was spectacular, so I suggest to have it as fresh as possible and my rate refers to the fresh version.

3073,"2011-12-13",3.5,"500 mL bottle from Grape & Gourmet.  Dark brown pour with barely a bubble.  The aroma is of strong smoked bacon, so strong that nothing else dares to peer through.  As strong as the aroma is I was a bit surprised at how subdued the smoke is in the flavor.  Sweet malts are noted and the smoke tends to creep up in the background.  First I will say what did not work for me with this beer.  The carbonation is severely lacking.  The mouthfeel is a bit thin.  Besides the smoke there is little else going on.  That being said, here is what I do like.  While mouthfeel is thin and while there is not much else going on other than the smoke maybe that is the point.  If this had a thicker, creamier mouthfeel and the smoke was something that was even more prevailing this may be overwhelming.  While I tend to prefer smoked porters and stouts this is what I would recommend if someone wanted to try a true rauchbier.  This is a review that is almost in conflict with itself but I think that is fitting.  This is a challenging beer, but probably the best example of a true rauchbier I have come across.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","zizzybalubba"

3073,"2011-11-25",4.3,"500 ml bottle.  Served in a mug, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with about a half inch light tan head.  Head retention is decent, with a small amount of lacing.  Aroma is strong, it smells mostly like smoked meats and malt, along with some bready malt and wood.  The taste is similar to the aroma, its mainly smoked meats/malt, but theres also some wood, caramel malt and a bit of sweet dark fruit noticeable, too.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit creamy with moderate, soft carbonation.  I think its a pretty good overall brew, Id buy this again in the future.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

3073,"2011-10-24",4.6,"500ml bottle into a pint glass.

Appearance is a dark ruby. Minimal head that quickly diminishes.

Smells heavily of smoke. Mostly campfire with some bacon. I cant smell any malt.

The taste is all smoke up front but as that fades, a malty sweetness comes through finishing slightly bitter. The smoke is present throughout, however. As I get into the beer, the initial shock of the smoke fades and the beer begins to taste more balanced. A lot more malt becomes apparent.

Overall I think I like this beer better than the marzen. It is a lot more in your face with the smoke and I will definitely seek it out again.

Pours dark brown in the glass but shows through a deep clear copper when held up to light.  There is a big fluffy beige head that recedes to a thin cap quickly.

The aroma is, typically, fantastic with a massive smoked wood character.  Some decent sweet malts and summer sausage.  Man do I love the nose on Schlenkerla beers.

The taste also starts with smooth smoked malts, lots of bacon and campfire.  Malts underneath to support the heavy smoke.  Very sweet but completely smoky.

Smell: Wow, the smoke aroma is incredible. Its like a bonfire being used to cook bacon. There is an undercurrent of dark fruity sweetness in there too.

Taste: Ashy taste up front reminiscent of the ash from an over-roasted marshmellow up front followed by a touch of dark fruit slipping through in the middle before ending with a strong punch of wood-fired smoke and a touch of hoppy bitterness. Aftertaste is sweetly smoky.

Drinkability: High drinkability. This would be perfect for a bonfire on a cool autumn evening.

I was with an older couple and they didnt want to eat around all the drunk people in the restaurant at the actual brewery. They did tell me that I had to get this beer and I have loved them for it ever since. The older gentleman that told me about it was too old to drink but had to have a sip none the less. One of my favorite beers to smell and of COURSE drink. It smells and drinks like liquid sausage. This  brewery is king of the smoked beers. Ive had many delicious ones from various other major breweries as well as all their other beers all of which are smoked but nothing comes close to the flavor of the Schlenkerla Urbock, Their Marzen is a good substitute if this isnt around but if you want a meal in a bottle this is the one! Ive been happy that this beer has been easier and easier to find. When I started working for Union Distributors, I was flabbergasted that we help distribute this awesome beer. This is in my top 3.

Nagyon sötétbarna, majdnem fekete szín, kissé sárgás, közepes méretű habbal a tetején. ami egészen kitartó. Az illata semmivel sem összetéveszthető: gyakorlatilag egy megsült füstölt szalonna, és egy nagyon pici gyümölcsösség. Ízében nehéz megtalálni a baksör alapköveit, mindent elnyom a füstölt íz, de azért sikerült kivenni némi aszalt szilvát és karamellt, de ez az íz valami brutális. Ha nem olvastam volna arról, hogy ilyen létezik, lehet azt hittem volna, hogy valami bakban, érleléskor egy baromi nagy egészben füstölt mangalicát tettek és hagyták, hogy összeérjen. Mindezek ellenére egész jól csúszott, nem tűnt annyira testesnek, és egy idő után a füstölt íz is megszokható, de nekem egy 2-3 deci bőven elég ebből egyszerre.

It pours a deep brown with a fizzy off-white head that leaves spots of lacing as it recedes.

The smell is sweet and smoky. The smoke is like campfire almost with a burnt scent while the sweet malt adds an almost fruitiness to the brew along with the hops.

The flavor follows. It has more of an earthy flavor with the smoke mixing with the bitterness of the hops. It still sweet and malty though and that provides the balance.

This is the quintessential Rauchbier.

3073,"2011-02-18",4.2,"500 ml Bottle - Pour is deep brown/reddish with a little off-white head that disappears quickly.  Aroma is huge smoke, bacon, ham, other smoky meats, dark malt, sweetness, caramel, toffee, woody/earthy.  The beer is mildly sweet/malty upfront - which immediately gives way to a sharp smoky/meaty center.  The end is bit bitter and the smokiness lasts forever on your tongue.  Literally tastes like bacon or smoked ham, obviously this is an acquired taste.  I have acquired said taste, however.  Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is a bit on the higher end (the one characteristic Im not crazy about) I like this a lot - I think the Eiche Doppelbock by Schlenferla is a better beer overall - but this can definitely hold its own.  It is much smokier than the Marzen, quite a bit smokier than the Lager and of course, much more full-bodied and thicker - its almost on par with the Doppelbock, which I think is a bit more balanced and complex.

Palate: smooth, rich, and soft. Definite a rich breadiness permeated with mesquite, smoke, and a hint of chocolate cake. Smoke permeates and soothes each aspect of her palate; front, middle, back, finish. Burnt charcoal and burnt mesquite strongest in the back.

D- This is my first experience with a rauchbier and it was very enjoyable. I cant say I will be craving this type of beer every week, but I will definitely try this beer again.","Colorado, USA","Vikingbrew"
3073,"2010-09-27",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2011 500 ml bottle. Rated @ 21.3.2009.
Pours a beautiful black colour with a brownish head. Aroma of excellent Bamberg smokiness, bread, rye and roasted malts. Flavour of smoked malts, burnt wood, leather and mild coffee. Full bodied and a very pleasant slicky mouthfeel. Top 10. (10-4-9-4-17)
500 ml bottle.
Pours a beautiful dark brown colour with a firm, creamy, thick head. Good retention. Aroma of smoked wood, birch leaves and smoked ham. Flavour of sweet smoked malts, birch leaves, sweet dried fruits, quite bitter hops and loads of smoked wood too. Full bodied, thick mouthfeel and a lovely smooth, dry, smoked finish. Not as good as I remembered, but still one of the best smoked beers. Eiche is better, though.","Tampere, FINLAND","lusikka"
3073,"2010-09-26",3.9,"Wow that is something amazing. Pours a very dark clear amber with medium but strong creamy head. Aroma is in your face, with big notes of chocolate and smoked pork.  For such a smokey aroma the flavor is quite balanced and by such i mean that malt sweetness and light bitterness is not completely blown away by smokey character.  Full bodied but has a very thin mouth feel ending very smoothly with just the right aftertaste.","Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","Rockcrawler"
3073,"2010-09-24",4.4,"Amazing beer. Pours amber with medium off-white head. Aroma is of bacon and chocolate. The taste is similar. Very smoky and bacony, with chocolate, some toasted malt and hints of coffee. Nothing about this beer is bad from start to finish. Its unique though and I could understand some people not enjoying. But if you want chocolate covered bacon that you can drink until drunk, then this is your beer.","Highland Heights, Kentucky, USA","Chuckaduck"
3073,"2010-09-13",3.9,"500 ml bottle purchased a year ago at Total Wine in Tustin ($4.79).  Pours a deep lovely garnet color with one finger of beige foam.  Aroma full of old leather horse saddles, liquid smokiness, bacon, smoked jerky.  Flavor also full of thick campfire smoke, leather, charred wood, and chewy baked beans cooked over the campfire.  There are also some dark fruit notes hidden amongst all the smoke.  There is even a bit of sweetness emerging late in the flavor.  Surprisingly light mouthfeel considering the intensity in both the nose and flavor.  This will go quite well with the grilled pork chops that I am about to heat up.

3073,"2010-09-05",3.7,"Pours dark brown with just a touch of red. Smells smokey as hell, bacon, pork rinds, beef jerky, and rich rib yumminess. Tastes malty and medium rich. Smoother than I expected. Not nearly as smokey on the palate as it is on the nose. I like it. Wouldnt want a lot of this though.","Brentwood, Tennessee, USA","MmmcKay"

3073,"2010-08-29",3.7,"Been scared of this one for a while.
Pours dark copper with an off-white creamy head leaving great lacing.
Most prominent aroma is of course the smoky character, seemingly mixing smoked almonds with smoked ham. Very nice! Underneath is a lot of caramel malt, but this beer is definately more focused on the smoke.
As a flavour, its even more noticeable, very woody. Accompanying it is some nice caramel that just cant keep up with the smoke. Grassy and spicy hops are also noticeable, contributing a mild but pleasant bitterness.
Carbontion is just a little too high in my opinion.
Pleansantly surprised with this, I really liked it!","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Davros"

Medium chewy mouthfeel, hop flavours shine through the semi-sweet light medium carbonated body. Smoked flavours and aromas are there but to a lesser extent than the marzen, with the malt sweetness and some roastyness coming through well with the hop flavour and bitterness. Hop flavours seem to linger a touch longer than usual, combining with a complex finish of smoke, sweetness, savoury flavours and a touch of bitterness.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","imaragingbull"

Taste:  liquid smoke, roasted tree bark, well-done steak; smoky bitterness gives way to a hint of sweetness.  Finish:  short and dry, but the smoke lingers.  Of course it does.  Notes:  Very interesting beer.  Love the uniqueness of the flavors, but didnt actually care for the beer all that much.  However, Id recommend it to anyone, just for the experience.

S- Wow. Very strong smoky aromas. Smells liked smoked meat. My dog hasnt left me alone since I popped open the bottle.

T- Upfront is some mild smoke bitterness with a faint malt background. The flavors really come out for the finish which is all smoked meat. A little bit of spiciness emerges as well. Minimal smokey bitterness lingers.

P-Medium to high carbonation and light drinkable lager body. Body almost feels a bit charred.

O- This is my very first rauchbier. Smells and tastes great but this is more of a novelty drink to me than something that I could enjoy regularly. Not as drinkable as most lagers... I like it though and would buy it again.

A big thanks to Mansquito for this, one of two very unique and good beers given to me for my birthday.  Cheers.","Denver, Colorado, USA","tennessejed420"

Comment:

This beer is very smoky, not sure if its heavier then the märzen. From my notes it seems like the märzen is more intense but I would have to test them together to make sure. Im personally not a huge fan of smoke beers but I think this works well. Tastes a bit like it has been filtered through an old hunting cabin.

Regarding food I think this would work well with regular home cooked food. Maybe some oven roasted potatoes and veggies with a big chunk of meat or sausages.","Örebro, SWEDEN","olsvammel"
3073,"2010-01-17",3.9,"Pours a deep mahoganey with scant off white head.  Smoke is abundant in the nose and flavor.  Smoked meats and campfire, but in a very pleasant way.  There may be some toffee and other malty notes in there as well, but smoke definitely takes the front seat in this one.  I wish I could recall how closely this one compares to the Marzen version.  Pretty close I think.  This isnt the kind of beer most folks are going to pick up on a regular basis and it could be argued that it is somewhat one dimensional, but it really is quite enjoyable.  Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation that prevents this one from sinking too deeply.  We served it with smoked ham last night for dinner and it was very good.  If your not a huge fan of smoked beers, I understand the Wheat version of this beer is a little less smokey.","Portland, Oregon, USA","dkingsella"

Though Ive started eating food again, I still like it quite a bit.  It remains the smokiest beer Ive ever had.  Pours a deep amber with a light tan head.  The aroma is wonderful and bears a strong resemblance to pork bbq.  The flavor is actually milder than one might expect, like someone took a delicious and refreshing bock and strung it up in their smoke house for a few weeks.  Nothing but the best from Schlenkerla.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Teege"

Dark reddish brown with a small off-white head that quickly goes away. Lots of lacings.

Big smok aromas of ham or other smoked meats. Notes of wood and hints of ashes. Surprisingly lots of heavy malt aromas (caramel, toffee) break through. Dangerously close to being cloying, but quite impressive smell.

The flavor is quite sweet and not as dominated by smoke as expected. Full malty flavors of caramel and toffee. Well integrated smoky aromas of ham, bacon, salami... you know the deal. The finish is spot on with juicy malts, burnt wood, ashes and ham, and ha hint of spicy alcohol. 

Full bodied and very smooth. Quite demanding.

A big and heavy beer, but I really like the complexity and balance between malts and smoke in this one. Liquid bread? More like liquid ham disguised as liquid bread.","Malme, SWEDEN","ricke"

The aroma is fantastic; exceeding my expectations which where very high. Complex, nicely smoky (very balanced and not overwhelming), with caramel, molasses, wood (beechwood and oak), bourbon, black olives, leather, black pepper and tar being most present. Hints of ginger, eucalyptus, tobacco and mint. Deeply inviting. Quite a lot of black olives in the taste which is woody, sweet, medium bodied. Low carbonation. Late bitterness. Extremely pleasant.

Flavor is smoked meat, toasted hardwoods, burnt softwoods, lots of toasted peat, dark caramel, a hint of aged vanilla, a nice sweet wholesome graininess, sugary figs, some sweetbread spices, more grilled fruit and some milk chocolate. Finish is chocolate, smoky vanilla, dark caramel, hints of lightly toasted marshmallows, hickory and other hardwood smokes and some sweet dates and figs.

Palate remains soft throughout, and the moderate carbonation keeps this beer relatively refreshing.  Flavor has the same meaty qualities as the nose, with some lightened flavors (perhaps wheat?) through the mid-palate.  Initial flavor just blasts you with bacon bits, honey-glazed ham, wood-grill smoke, and a touch of caramel.  Finish is dry, and flavors conclude with some bitterness and dark chocolate.  Interesting brew, but I just couldnt get into this.  I think the Marzen is more drinkable altogether, but I warn that this assessment is coming from someone without much experience with these beers.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

This beer smells for all the world like the bush a couple of days after it burns, there is no subtly in this beer, it is ALL about the smoke. Very strong smoky smells dominate but in behind it I can pick up some caramel/coffee from the malts. Surprisingly UN-smoky flavor, in the mouth the malts jump forward! Roasted malt flavors dominate, warm caramel and burnt coffee, mildly bitter with some late sweetness. A medium body beer with a mild carbonation and the higher alcohol content (6.5% - ish) provides a warming feel. Smoke tends to overpower as the drink progresses and the glass and content warms.","AUSTRALIA","Threepwood"
3073,"2009-04-05",3.5,"1 pint 0.9 fl oz bottle (first of this style i have had).  For starters, there is no doubt that your about to drink a smoked beer after smelling this one for the first time.  There is just a lot of smokiness to the aroma, and basically everything about this beer. If only sitting there drinking this one without really paying attention, the main qualities you would get out of it would be solely the smokiness, but if really appraised closely, there is much more to this beer.  In the aroma though, notes initially of smoked pork and smoked Gouda cheese, but underneath there is some nuttiness and rich caramel to it.  Good head on the pour of medium thickness tan cream, stays nicely, medium opacity in the body, rusty sangria in color.  As far as the drinking experience goes, its much easier to describe the overall feel than the flavors.  Medium bodied, a stimulating feel, and very smooth overall finish that to me shows off the quality of brewing that took place making this beer.  The flavor notes on the other hand, I find harder to judge.  Maybe just too inexperienced with this unique type of beer.  The notes that I get are not as meaty and unbeer-like as the aroma, but smokiness obviously plays a large role, more of in a fire smoked grain sort of way.  Some nutty notes, caramel, as well as chocolate, maybe even some minor dark berry sweetness, with an actual hint of leafy hop bitterness in the rather dry finish.  Positive impressions of this beer definitely grew as i drank more, but uniqueness of this one didnt quite grow on me in all that positive of a way.  I definitely didnt dislike it because theres alotta good things going on here.  I just feel that I will need to rerate after i trying more of the style.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"

Some parts of it intrigued me and got me excited, while others made me think too much of smoked gouda and ham.  Moral of the story?  This might not be the best smoked beer to start with.  In the remaining years, Ive trained myself on some lesser smoked beers (tough work, I tell ya) and worked my way into figuring out what these meaty bastards are all about.  This one is damn fine.  Dark brown pour into a Duvel glass with massive off-white head that quickly recedes but sticks around.  Meaty, smoky nose with some lovely charred wood notes as well.  Campfire smoke might be the clearest note in there.  Some bacon and ham.  Some roasty malt notes and a hint of chocolate, I think.

Poured a beautifully smokey ruby color with an off-white head that hung around for the duration of my session.  If youre not careful, the aroma will knock you off your feet.  A deeply smokey aroma distinctively reminiscent of deer bologna.  Very smokey and pungent in the best possible way.  The flavor is singular in the world of beer tasting.  Much like your first brettanomyces funk beer, but at the delicious end of the spectrum.  It tastes just as it smells, with deeply smoked character blended delightfully with sweet malts.

Inch thick, beige, fizzy head that dissipates quickly and leaves a decent amount of lacing. Not the funky look of the Weizen. Aroma is more of a sweet smokiness. Still has a nice bonfire aroma, but not as meaty as the Weizen. More woody. Some deep caramel and nuttiness as well. Flavor is nice, I already know I like this more than the Weizen. Initial roasted bitterness, sweet and deep caramel middle with some molasses too, finishing a bit nutty, smoky, and bitter. Slightly salty and pretty dry, however, much more enjoyable drying finish when comparing to the Weizen. Palate is medium to full and very smooth. Overall, this is a damn good beer. Great complex flavor and extremely well balanced. This is less smoky than the Weizen and actually works much better with the sweet maltiness. Enjoyable bitterness makes it that much better.

Initial aroma is very similar to bacon or barbeque ribs. Body is likewise similar as an intense meaty experience- could be bacon grease but very light on the stomach and palate. Strange but enjoyable. Would try again but would want to eat it- I mean drink it- with a big steak or roasted pork. For the bock style it is fabulous and can only be beaten by gems like Celebrator. Would highly recommend for a unique beer experience. 8/24/2008 7/4/8/4/16=3.9500mL courtesy of MrChopin. Having all the Aecht smoked beers back to back really allows you to see how the Marzen is the best of the four. The urbock has a roasted apple nose, loaded with red apples that detract from the big bacon and barbecue.

3073,"2008-08-18",3.8,"Dark ruby with a small, bubbly white head that I coaxed out of it. Nice nose that glides across the room with spicy, meaty smoke, slight fruits, and sweet, tea-like malts.

3073,"2008-08-13",3.7,"16.9 oz bottle into pint glass.  Pours a nice clear red with a big light brown head that left some nice lace.  Smells mostly like hickory smoke with some protruding amber maltyness. - reminds me of a BBQ/campfire.    The flavor isnt quite as smokey as the nose, and is thus a bit more appealing to me than the Marzen (which was a bit overboard on the smoke for me).  It tastes pretty simple at first, like amber malt with a definite smoked wood character, with a bit of a hop presence on the finish.  The more I drink, the more I am getting roasted chocolate and coffee notes - even a hint of cherry - beneath (or maybe within) the smoke character. Half way through the glass I became much more comfortable with the style and began to enjoy this beer quite a bit.  Much more balanced than the Marzen IMO.  Medium bodied and smooth on the palate.  Overall: this is definitely a unique style, and a good example of that style.  I bet this goes great with a burger at a smoky cookout.  I would be interested to try a cask version of this and see what the wood does to it.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

The beer can be smelled from about three feet away and it smells like a smokehouse: peat, bacon, wood, and all that. The taste is slightly sweet and really intensely smoky. The front is less smoky than the finish in my opinion because the front tastes more like a normal bock beer with a little bit of fruitiness and a bunch of malts. Leaves a really intense aftertaste as well. Cool. Would be hard to drink more than one of these I would think.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

3073,"2008-07-12",4.2,"500mL Bottle. Wow. That is some dense smoke in the nose. That goes beyond the light pig fats and campfires to complete smoky delight arising from porcinis, lake trout belly fat, burning pine sap, and charred aspen logs. Develops into a real spicy, floral smoke character that can be as perfumed as many musky incenses and resins. A complete delight. Pours in a clear deep red-tinted brown, with a good rim of off-white. Flavor retains this smoke density, balanced it exquisitely with rich sugars and alcohol. The malt nestles a smoke of burning walnut shells, juniper bush, and weed fires with caramels, smoked meats and candied dark fruits. Delicious! Yet dry and palatable. A crisp cut of hops and hickory sweat give balance with a back end kick of bitterness. Alcohols helps bring all these flavors up and alive. In the end, the smoke wasn’t as expressive or deep as I wanted it to be, but it’s all rich, delicious and balanced. A fantastic smoked beer.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Medium-to-full, viscous mouthfeel: loads of chewy dried fruits, smoked meats, char and ashiness; in the Marzen, it was a simple display of awesome smokiness; here, the malt core is more apparent: chewiness, dense malt character, and plenty of viscosity; quite heavy in the mouth for 6.5%; still, very drinkable with a gorgeous smokiness.

Schlenkerlas Urbock pours mahogany with explosions of tiny carbonation bubbles rushing to the surface. A two finger dirty white head formed on the pour and eventually fell to a respectable crown leaving patchy lacing on its way down.

While their Marzen has more of a smokey bacon aroma. The Urbock reminds more of strong campfire smoke.There is some nutty and caramel maltines once I get past the smoke. There seems to be a bit too much smoke in here and its blanketing the other aromas. 

The maltiness is much more pronounced in the flavor than the nose suggested. A bready nuttiness and caramel maltiness end up being a nice compliment to the smoke. The smokiness while still large and in charge is much more subdued than in the aroma.

Medium bodied with a silky smoothness. The carboantion creates a velvety texture on the swallow and the smoke lingers for awhile leaving the feel of a thin film on your tongue.

For a beer with this amount of smokiness this is incredibly easy drinking. Next time Ill pair this with something smoked from the grill.

As this beer warms the malts begin to shine. In my opinion, they were a little heavy handed with the smoked malts but it was a good beer none-the-less. The marzen is still my favorite from Aecht Schlenkerla

A perfect match wfor my lunch ham sandwich.  As predicted the smokyness overshadows all aspects but its the little sweet smacks that come oand make this brew stnd alone.

3073,"2008-02-21",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 27, 2008 Bottle. Pours fairly dark, a cola color, though some light shines through a ruby layer near the narrower bottom of the snifter. A small white head remains on top.   Loads of smoked meat, bacon, oak, and a nice sweet, bready tone make up the aroma. A sip is like a blast to the mouth with smoke, this really is more intense than their marzen. I gotta say, I like this one even better. The mesh of raw smoky (think smoldering campfire) flavor, meat, bacon, sweet fruits, caramel, and more is delightful. The finish is actually even better, all the aspects culminate in a lingering, distinctly  (hate to use the word again but. . .) smoky package.

Bottle from McSrooges. Pours a dark muddy dried-blood color with just a small head. Aroma = smoke. Im tired of breweries pussyfooting around the use of awesome smoked malt. Schlenkerla is obviously unafraid. This beer is among the meatiest, smokiest Ive ever sampled.  The aroma is filled with crispy bacon, sausage, ash tray, cigars, campfire. The flavor is more strong, assertive, solid smoke. Oaken flavors come across in a bittersweet, wooden quality. Somehow even though this is hugely smoky, other flavors are detected in the back and meld flawlessly with all the meat and fire. This stuff is delicious. It is both rewarding and disappointing at the same time that perhaps the best and most robust smoked beer Ive ever had is constantly right in front of my face.

Bottle. Im sick and tired of ""smoked"" beers pussyfooting around being smoked. This is serious. Real, genuine bacon qualities are imparted in this brew. I even get hints of bacon fat. Tobacco, campfire, smoke, meat. Yes, this is a tru rauchbier. Hail.

[August 26, 2008]

Bottle in a side by side with Schlenkerla Marzen. While I found these two beers to be quite similar, the urbock has a slightly rounder flavor with a tad more sweetness. Though as genuinely smoky as it is, it leans more towards meat than its sister beer. The mouthfeel here is slightly heavier which works quite well. Though I discovered some subtle nuances between these two tremendous rauchbiers, I wasn’t really able to choose a favorite.  Major kudos to this brewery for understanding the true potential of smoke in a beer. They continue to establish dominance in this style.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Appearance was a copper-red although it was a bit flat.  Aroma was an astringent liquid smoke astringency, and was more of a burning flavor intensity than it was a savory smell. Flavor was coppery and spicy and actually a bit less smoky flavor than I expected. Mouthfeel was a bit flat.

App.:  Very deep mahogany, clear, rocky tan head.

Palate:  Medium body, soft but full effervescence.
  
Flav.:  Buckets of that meat smoke, some caramel and dried fruit in the distant background, maybe a touch of herbaceousness, off-dry with a little bitterness; after half the bottle, the smoke still dominates, but it is willing to share a bit more of my palate with the herbal maltiness.

3073,"2007-04-14",4.2,"Sampled March 2007
I am definitely looking forward to this brew, unfortunately this beer was not available while I was actually in Bamberg.  This beer pours with a brilliantly clear body, but you can hardly tell that as it is so dark.  When held up directly to a bright light it shows beautiful dark ruby hues, but otherwise sits in the glass a very dark, deeply burnt amber color.  It is topped by a frothy, initially two-finger thick, dirty tan, to pale brownish head.  As I pour this brew it is immediately quite apparent that this is a smoked brew.  Beech smoke, yet with out the sharp acrid notes of actual smoke, is the dominant characteristic of this beers nose.  Really reminds me of the smell my jacket takes on after a cold evening spent round a campfire.

Thick and chewy & I mean chewy; it coats the mouth quite well and the flavors really linger on the palate.  This beer is actually chewy enough that I perceive it as being much warm than the actual 50ºF (10ºC) serving temperature would suggest.  Of course the smoke flavors are dominant, but there is some much malt packed into this brew that it is quite noticeable as well.  Sweet notes of caramelized grain, toffee, lightly charred bread crust (though not the astringent burnt character but the smoke character one get in that char) and other malt flavors play a significant, yet clearly supporting role here.  This at times makes me think that I am eating a nice, hearty, chewy, crusty bread that has been cooked over a smoky fire.  While fairly thick, it still goes down so smooth, with a perfectly creamy mouthfeel to it.

The alcohol is only at 6.5%, yet this beer drinks much bigger than that; it has really captured what in my mind is a chewy Bock like character.  I have been semi-regularly brewing a Rauch Märzen because of sampling this and Spezials beer fresh at the source.  I have been toying with brewing a Bock version for the last couple years and this has sealed the deal; I definitely need to brew a couple kegs of this up.  This is just so damn tasty and wonderful.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3073,"2007-04-10",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 26, 2007 On tap at Map Room in Chicago.  Not into rauchbier (smoked beer) but decided to give it a try.  Much more complex in aroma and flavor than other rauchbiers Ive tried.  Smelled and tasted like smoked bacon, with a clean aftertaste and decent body to back it up.  After a few sips your taste buds get numb to the intense flavor and its easier to drink after that.  Definitely not a session beer, but interesting enough that Im glad I tried it while it was available on tap.  I imagine for people into smoked beers-- this one is an intense treat.","USA","Driftwood6"

3073,"2007-04-02",4.1,"As smoked beers go, this is one of the best.  Deep brown pour with a lighter brown head that dissipates into a constant ring.  Great lacing.  Aroma is exactly the same as the smell of a charcoal barbeque grill when you first open it to light it.  Bacon, malt, and oak are mixed nicely in the flavor.  Not as overpowering as the Marzen version.  I only wish this one was easier to find.","San Diego, California, USA","trokini"

3073,"2007-03-28",4.8,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2009 From a 500mL Bottle.  Pours a ruddy, transparent cedar bark color with a tall layer of creamy, tan head.  Well sustaining head that revives itself beautifully with layers of shimmering, oily tinted bubbles.  Intense smoked aroma, obviously, but the light hardwood - alderwood, beechwood, maple, whatever it is -  character keeps it from getting overly soyish or teriyaki like in the meaty dimensions.  The smoked characters remind me much more of a delicate smoked salmon or some lightly salted hickory bacon.  Some nutty notes combine with a light saltiness to make me crave some smoked cashews to snack on while enjoying this brew.  Light to medium bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel that contributes some lightness and overall drinkability for the brew.  Incredibly silky soft texture.  The smoke characters are intense, but there are some dry chocolate and nutty characters that linger through the flavors and palate as well.  Digging a little deeper reveals some almost tobacco-like malt character.  All the while, the smoke character plays on, never yielding its assertiveness.  Delicious.  I love how the smoke can be such a powerful, delicious dimension to the beer throughout the entire sensory experience, but still allow the other subtlties to come and go as they please in their entertaining sideshows.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

The flavor continues with the strong smoked sausage.  Theres some malt flavors in there, but its hard to taste much past all the smoke.

3073,"2007-02-20",4.3,"16.9 oz. bottle. The amazing and powerful aroma features smoked ham, fresh pretzels with honey mustard, and lemony hops. It is unusual and welcome but perhaps a tad much. The beer pours a deep, clear copper-brown with a large amount of thick, uneven cream-colored head and extensive lacing. It looks even better than it smells. All of the smoky elements of the aroma are prominent in the flavor. In addition, the flavor features a very nice sweet roasted malt taste. This would be a very tasty beer even without the smoke, but with the smoke it is a uniquely delicious treat. ASRU is medium in body and a little undercarbonated. Not surprisingly, it produces a smoky and malty aftertaste.

Smell; theres a definite woody, smoky aroma going on, but not quite as strong as the marzen. Im not really able to pick out any other aromas out of this one, but Im not really all that surprised. Even so it smells pretty good.

Taste; those smoked flavors are definitely the frst to hit you as expected, but theres also some sweet caramel malts, with a little bit of caramel as well. Finishes a touch bitter, with some nice, but not overwhelming smoked meat flavors, with some hints of rye bread. This seems a bit more balanced than the marzen was, and a beer will have to buy again. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mild carbonation, and a much better drinkability than I was expecting.

Not as big bad and nasty with the smoke (and I mean that in the best way possible) as the Marzen, but just as delicious.  Woody and hickory smoke particularly comes out over the slightly caramel malts and light floral/peppery hops.  Very nice full creamy mouthfeel, healthy viscosity.  In the flavor, the malt is much more forward than one would guess.  It holds its own against that less than bacon-esque smoke flavor.  A little salty, light charcoal and toast come out in this beer.  A sweet and salty finish, with some smoke coming back along with the toast in the lingering aftertaste.

Taste has a surprisingly strong caramel and roast presence, living up to its ""urbock"" monicker.  Smoke is an equal player in the flavor, unlike the aroma.  Midsip, the taste is coffe and bread.  Finishes very woody, with a mild hop bitterness.  However, theres an effervescent smoke to the whole experience.  Even when its not being tasted, you know its there.

It really clung to the glass.  Aroma is strongly smokey hints of camp fire, naked wood, and carmelized sugars.  Flavor is less assertive than the nose.

Palate is medium, with a very rounded mouth-feel. Smoke and coffee  bitterness/acidity hang on for a long finish.

Taste is both campfire smoke and woodchip burner smoke combined with sweet malts and a light hoppy finish. It is suprisingly drinkable despite the flavors that are present in this brew.Definently not the kind of beer that I would have every day, but certainly a treat to have in the winter months.","Virginia, USA","Nel"

Aroma is extremely smoky, with a little bit of sweet dark malt peeking through; reminiscent of both campfires and bacon.  Flavor is more of the dark malt up front, with a hint of smokiness, and then turning to a smoky/malty full-bodied middle, and a very smoky but still slightly malty lingering finish.

The aroma is full of sweet smoke - very smokey and some sweetness (almost like the crust from a smoked honey glazed ham - but with more smoke).

3073,"2006-09-21",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 24, 2009 This beer is different! It pours dark brown with red hue in the light, and has a thin off-white head. The aroma amazingly captures the character of smoked sausages, beef jerky and has a malty background. Beautiful, creamy mouthfeel and body. Full flavored and very chewy. Hickory like smokeyness is apparent, similiar to the flavors of sausage and bacon off of a fresh grill. Theres a slight, subtle malty touch in the background, but a long, full smokeyness predominates. The finish is long and has a pleasant, slightly burnt like character, almost giving off the feeling of a wood-burning stove. Good for a cold fall or winter night. Very different.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

Spicy flavor, full of spicy yeast up front, and if can you believe this, theres not a lot of smoke up front on the first sip... that changes soon.  The meaty salami flavor shows up very strong, and the palate is mostly crisp and spicy, which is really nice.  The smoked meat and smoked cheese flavors are divine... reminds me of elk camp, and really this is a beer I have to bring to elk camp again this year.  The nose is more of the same meaty salami scent, but its crazy delicious.  Up front theres a ton of huge biscuity malts, then it turns to a smooth long-lasting smoked ham and salami flavor into the finish.  edit: november 2011 oak barrel at schlenkerla, um, what happened guys?  dull, rough, even fizzy?  nooo!","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

I can also pick out a very light toasty malt, but smoke dominates every aroma aspect of this beer.  The flavor on the other hand is a different story.  Lighlty raisiny dark fruit and toasty malt flavors, well balanced throughout, and a bit of a smokey aftertaste.  Not nearly as smokey as I remember this beer to be.  Light sweetness up front, but balanced well toward the end of the dry and lingering smokey finish and aftertaste.  Lighter medium carbonation with a fuller medium body.  Wow!  I remember this as being a lot more smoke dominant in the flavor to the point of being un drinkable, but as I taste it again, I rather like it!

Moderate carbonation and a smooth, slickly textured medium bodied mouthfeel.

A nice smokey taste, smoked age ham, a light charred wood flavor, toasted grain, the spicy alcohol provides a nice warmth in the palate, a malt breadiness starts to come out towards the end along with a caramelized maltiness, gives the taste a some sweetness and a smoky caramel malty finish, a really pleasant, tasting rauchbier drinkability.

3073,"2006-08-13",3.6,"Poured a dark violet/ruby with a large fluffy off-white head.  Aroma of grapes, molasses, and smoked pork akin to bacon or kielbasa.  The flavor starts with the sweet vinous flavor of the bock but is quickly joined by an equally potent taste of smokiness that has touches of bacon and wood in it.  Finishes slightly dry with a bit more of the sweetness than the smoke.  I can taste that this is a well-made beer, but I admit Im still not sold on a beer where smoke flavor takes center stage.  I like beer with smoked pork, but not in the same glass.  Id love to try this beer without the smoke (I know to some that would be heresy), because the bock flavor here is really nice.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

Flavor is sweet and savory, dominated of course by the smoked malts, burnt molasses, but with light herbal, earthy and floral as well, again, rather reminiscent of the aftertaste of a nice piece of jerky.

Some lace. Initial moutfeel is that of body. The smoke characteristic is stronger in the nose than it is on the palate. Finish is smooth and pleasant. Very drinkable and enjoyable.

This Rauchbier Urbock is like your favourite greasy spoon joint in a bottle.  Mahogany body with a medium beige head.  I just drank a bottle of the Marzen and a bottle of the Urbock side-by-side.  Smoke-time!!!  Although their Urbock is supposed to be the reference for the Smoked genre I thought the Marzen more than held its own.  Aroma was campfire smoke for the Marzen and smoked bacon for the Urbock.  Smoke intensity in mouth was comparable (very high for both).  The Marzen has a lighter body with flavours of roasted malts, candies, light caramel and a surprise lemony twist.  The finish was refreshing and even a little tart.  The Urbock on the other hand has flavours of creamy malts, thick caramel, molasses with a long and intense finish of molasses.  Overall the Urbock is more intense but because of its heavy side I wouldnt drink two pints in a row.  While with the Marzen after one pint I was craving for more and more.  Its a draw.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The palate agrees with an earthy, old-world malt that sweetens on the finish just to be cut back by a wisk of smoke-richness.  This beer is meant for food, smoked cheeses, meats, etc.  I baked an onion with sausage and breads crumbs in the hollow center and stuck a nice piece of peppered bacon with it.

A big, smoky nose like uncured bacon, creamy caramel, deep grains, some brown sugar, sticky barbeque and some mild, earthy hops.  The body is thick, robust and lightly carbonated with plenty of heft on the tongue.  The flavor is sweet, smoky and actually a little bitter.  The smokiness is dominate with fairly substantial sweetness before a surprisingly crisp hop bitterness tweaks the end just enough to keep either of the other two elements from becoming too powerful.

The minute I opened it I was engulfed in a smokey cloud of beer particles. I couldnt help but get out a bottle of BBQ sauce and an apron. The smooth dark consitency only added excitement. I think the head was a perfect ammount. Taste.. just as smooth as predicted. Amazing. While drinking this my smoked brisket had finished so I helped myself to a few warm slices of that as well. This was actually a better flavor??!","USA","zilofidelious"

3073,"2006-02-16",4.9,"Its pretty hard to improve on pefection. Schlenkerla Rauchbier,  is the bench mark example of the style. The Ur-Bock is a maltier example, that does not use 100% rauch malt, but is a slicker, less smoky version. This beer, like the Marzen,  is truly outstanding. Its a little less smoky, but is  just as exceptional. Urbock pours to a beautiful, bright, deep amber to brown color, with a thick, creamy, white head, and a moderate  carbonation. The nose on this beer is outstanding, with lots of big sooty, and smoky aromas. The palate is slick and full, with lots of good, solid toasty and smoky/salty  malt flavor, on a very polished body. This beer finishes with more good slick and smoky malt flavor up front, then ends with a smoky/salty and slight warming burn. Outstanding beer. A touch stronger and maltier than the original, but another stellar example of rauchbier. As much a classic as the original.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
3073,"2006-02-16",2.8,"Before I open the bottle I just want to say that Ive never been more scared to try a beer before.  Ill probably feel the same if I can ever find a berliner weisse.  The style makes me shiver.  Plus the labels make me think the Third Reich is going to hunt me down if I bash it.  That being said, bombs away.  the only reason Im trying this is because Im trying to conquer all 70 beer styles.  UGGh, smells like beef jerky!  Seriously smells like a campfire.  How do they do that?  Pours out dark amber color with off-white frothy head.  (Sigh of relief)  The flavor is nowhere nearly disgusting as the aroma, though the smoke comes back on the aftertaste.  There is a little bit of chocolate in there and a little bit of smoke.  Psychologically, I cant get into this beer.  With every minute that goes by it loses the most nauseating aroma on earth.  Its like im drinking blood or something.  Everytime I take a sip I make a face and thats just not how a beer should make you feel.  If youre at all squeemish or weary stay as far away from this beer as possible.  I have to say that Im quite surprised at how readily available this beer is in my area.  I cant imagine that many, or even a few, like this beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
3073,"2006-02-12",3.5,"Pours a ruby/mahogany, mostly clear yet dark with a small and fading tan head. Fantastic aromas that I drank in more readily than the flavor: smoked sausage or ham, charcoal, campfire... awesome smoked character. Flavor is smoked and spiced as well, but it does come across rather chemical. Overall pleasant and rich, when Im looking for an over-the-top Rauchbier Im sure to turn to Aecht Schlenkerla.

Good body strength, and smooth mouthfeel; the dark caramel is lean, and perfectly blends with the harsh smokehouse character, the woody tones, and the light residual sweetness; correct bitterness, but some of it comes from the darker malts; if one thing, it may start showing light signs of oxidization in the end.Heavenly beer.2012-04-24, draught at Fermentoren, Copenhagen, 6.9% ABV, 10-5-10-5-20=50Dark brown color, with red shades; creamy head. The aroma, surprisingly, is very peaty, almost like an Islay whiskey. The carbonation is soft, allowing to the caramel and malt to fully develop in the mouth, then tangle with the smoke and residual sugars; in the flavor the smoke has nice accents of wood, fireplace and ham. Saying that the balance is perfect would be in understatement.Could easily be the best beer in the world. 2011-12-09, draught at Ølbaren, Copenhagen, 10-5-8-4-18=45Dark mahogany color, with fiery red beams and beige creamy head.

The smoke aroma is a world apart, with memories of smoked salami first, of burning wood later. Medium  bodied, it carries a rich chocolate and gently roasted malts flavor, caramel, with a strong smoke presence and a sugar veil that fits perfectly in the picture; lovely mouthfeel, smooth, fulfilling. The bitterness is not strong, there is some dark caramel instead; if anything, the roasted malt in the final is just a millimeter beyond my liking.This beer is as close to perfection as I may ask tonight.2006-02-08, bottle, 8-5-8-5-17=43Mahogany color, clean, with a creamy cap.

Decent smoke and sweet taste - the smoke compliments the sweetness, staying in the background, which is remarkable for these guys. Very nutty finish.

I would not say its creamy, but its close. Slight detection of hops at the end, however the smokiness is very dominant, but not overpowering. Leaves ring and lace, but these vanish quickly.

3073,"2006-01-19",3.9,"(500 ml bottle: $3.50 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) In succession, first came the Weizen, then the Märzen, and now the Urbock.  Urbock wins hands down.  The Weizen was an interesting mix of contrasting flavors.  The flavors in the Märzen seemed more unified and connected.  But the only in the Urbock does the malt have enough muscle to match the smokiness step for step.  Sweet, very malty and caramely, lightly bitter, and of course, very smoky, but unlike the other two rauchbier, the smoke never dominates the flavor here, but rather complements it.  I much prefer the balance this rauchbier shows.  The nose, well, it is dominated by the smoked meat aroma typical of these beers, but I dont mind if the sweet maltiness gets lost in the aroma too much.  Body is medium-full, somewhat sticky, and mildly carbonated, but the smoke still gives the palate life rather than becoming somewhat cloying.  Dark brown in color and nearly perfectly clear.  Like the other rauchbier, the light tan head is very fizzy and quickly and noisily dissipates, leaving barely a ring and a few spots of lace.  Overall, this is easily my favorite of the three Aecht Schlenkerla beers, and the style that I think works best with such a significant amount of smoke.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Aroma is lots of smoked malts, smoked salmon, maple bacon, smoked wood- possibly oak and probably beechwood.  Kinda got that campfire -like aroma. Also reminds me a bit of some cigar smoke.  Flavor is not quite as smokey but still lots of burnt wood, smoked meats, and a little bit of caramelized malt.  Possibly some chocolate or other nutty-like malts.

The aroma is more or less exactly the same as the Märzen, though perhaps slightly more powerful; loads of woody smoke, good sausages being cooked on a campfire, vanilla and a little roast malt. In the mouth it asserts itself more as a genuine bock, with loads of salty, smoky, powerful malt that verges on soy sauciness with some plum sauce thrown in. Palates ever-so-slighlty dull. Call me stupid but I was a bit surprised that this tasted so much like a bock - and Im not really a huge fan of bock. I really liked this but there are less of the things I really like about the Märzen (roast + bitterness) in this one, and its just not as easy to drink.RR: Fresh 07 bottles are in town now (Nov 07) and its tasting fantastic. Definitely not too ""bocky"" this year, just bucketloads of smokey intensity. Sausagey again too, Im not sure why this tastes like sausages and the Märzen doesnt. Delicious.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

Tasted from the bottle and poured into a tallboy glass. Sadly lifeless to look at; brilliant reddish brown hue with no head passed an island of tan bubbles that later filled the surface with a thin lather and left a little legs. Complex, rich and savoury aroma of dried and cured meats; salted, pickled fish, bread crumbs, burnt toffee, plums and other zesty fruits, with a light prickle of spice coming in late. A little thinner than expected on the palate, not as full on as the aroma, but flavoursome enough. Smoky ash fills the mouth from the get go, mixing well with toffee and caramel, woody malt flavours, rashers of over-cooked bacon and some dried calabresé sausage. Soft in carbonation and lightly sweet upfront, this was another treat for the senses. Getting better as it warmed, it became richer with more treacly fruit flavours coming in. Finish lacked the malt notes of the palate but the typified lingering smoke and burnt meat flavours were sumptuous and truly refreshing. Another divine beer from Heller-Trum, and a few steins of this at the restaurant next year for World Cup would possibly push it up on the top ten. Lovely!!! (50cL, BBE 07/06, Intl Beer Shop, W.

Chocolate and caramel duet joins a hickory, rawhide and crispy bacon tribute.  Smoked edge takes on flavor traits of toffee dropped into a breakfast skillet, dripping with bacon and sausage grease.  Slight moss and muddy mulch engrain an earthen edge.  Sweet mouth composure, fumigating all the porous pockets of the palate.  Toned carbonation and a malt profile that could put on a clinic.

A lot of smoked flavor, like bacon or something from Hillshire Farms.  I was scrambling to find some ribs or smoked gouda to go with the beer, but alas! none were to be found.

Feels as good as any beer Ive ever had in my mouth. The unfortunate, though, is that this tastes more like smoked venison than a traditional bock. Yes, there is a fantastic bock underneath it all, at times I can taste its brilliance, but it is overshadowed by the meats and cheeses and campfires that define this beer. The second sip contains a lot less smoke at first, in fact, the bock show through. Its pure silk, sweet, even hoppy. In the end, this is a phenomenal beer, worth trying.

Aroma is the absolutley most wonderful curing room smell of all time.  Tons of bacon, ham, smoke, wood.  Flavor is delightfully smokey and the base beer seems to be a bit more substantial than some of the other Schlenkerlas.  Flavors of smoke and sweet malt.  The promise of the aroma outshines the flavor of this one, though I do like it a lot.  I love the Schlenkerlas.  Prost!!!","Bedford, Texas, USA","TChrome"

3073,"2005-02-20",4.4,"500ml bottle, at least in my stash for a year, no date found on bottle.  I tried to help it head, but I got very little from it...dark chocolate color.  Instant smell of char, smoke hits me as I pour the beer.  Smoke of a fragrant sort...malt stands behind it.  THis doesnt scream campfire, but so much more....layered with all kinds of subtle nuances...char, ashtray, ham, hickory spice, fruit, roasting beans, chocolate...Luscious aroma.  Beer comes through smooth & light in the mouth.  Finish is fairly clean with remembrances of a smoke filled maltings.  This is one of the smokier of the smoked beers Ive had recently.  But it still has a good beer standing behind that smoke.  I lthink this would make a wonderful winter drink, in front of a fire...I find some subtle minty character in there too...This is juicy, robust, and scrumptous...Awesome beer.","Nebraska, USA","mdi"

Amazing aroma of smoked ham with a strong and rich malt character, the aroma doesnt seem different than the Schlenkerla Marzen, lets see about the flavor now. Oh God ! The flavor is even more amazing than the Marzens, theres the same strong smoked ham flavor that gets me damn hungry, the same rich, heavy maltiness and toffeeish sweetness but theres a fruity flavor that complement the whole package very well, theres also a mild bitter finish. This wonderfull brew has a full, round body, creamy and slightly oily texture and soft carbonation.

Its like sticking your head into a bag of really good jerkeyed meat and taking a huge huff like some sort of glue-addict. Poured ruby-brown with no head at all. Taste is of jerkeyed bacon and sausage smoked and aged over hickory. 4 hours later and the taste is still with me. How many BBQ places can you say do that!? Well, maybe Jenkins BBQ on Union street in downtown Jacksonville, but thats about it.  Well worth the $5 I dropped on this!!","Brooklyn, New York, USA","BeerBlockaid"

3073,"2005-01-14",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2005 Anyone for bacon? This German smoke beer packs an extraordinary aroma like pig roasting on a spit. A beautifully balanced ale that is often recommended with smoked meats but which I found paired equally well with a hard cheese.   It poured with a thinnish head that was more than compensated by that bacon-and-ashes aroma. Its firm-bodied with deliciously lingering smoky finish. A great beer to have with food.

3073,"2005-01-13",4.6,"Pours a dark reddish-brown with big light brown head with large bubbles and good head retention.  Aroma intense with beechwood smoked malt, which tends to give it a bacon like aroma.  Beautiful flavor.  The maltiness of the bock beer and the smoke balance out perfectly.  Moderately carbonated.  I like this one better than the other Schlenkerla rauchbiers, probably because this one is a bock and it balances better.  Very nice brew!","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","RateandPillage"
3073,"2005-01-06",4.1,"Pours ruby/brown, with a huge, light tan head.  Big aroma of smoky sausage, salmon, firewood smoke, and the kisses of my 3-pack-a-day grandmother.  Tastes malty, with some hops which give way to a gigantic smoked bacon/sausage flavor.  Dense, smoky palate.  Whether you like rauchbiers or not, you have to admire the aroma and taste of these things.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
3073,"2005-01-01",4.3,"Mmmmm....the initial aroma is thick-sliced bacon as soon as I opened the bottle. Poured a rich dark brown with little head, some lacing. Pour aroma was amazing, smoked bacon and ham, wood smoke, dark malts. Flavor was more of the same, with hints of chocolate, caramel, and molasses showing through the wood smoke. Medium body, lingering smoky aftertaste. Goes well with lox or smoked ham. Well worth it if you can find it.","Canton, Georgia, USA","gjamieson"

3073,"2004-12-21",3.8,"Pours a clear dark brown with ruby edges and no head - the weird thing was it didnt really foam at all, kind of like watery bubbles that quickly dissapated. Anyway... the aroma is awesome, straight smoked pork and wood. Taste has obvious strong notes of smokey bbq along with caramel, chocoalte, roasted malt, molasses/brown sugar and a touch of dark fruit. Medium soft body with only a tiny bit of carbonation. Perhaps my bottle has been on the shelf awhile? Either way, a very solid enjoyable brew. Avoid if you dont like smoked meats or if youre a vegetarian.","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"
3073,"2004-12-16",4.0,"This poured out a very dark brown with a reddish hue and a small tan head that was the result of an aggressive pour. The small head quickly falls to a coating of bubbles leaving not much in the way lace. HOLY SMOKES, is all that came to mind when I first poured this. The smell of the smoke quickly filled the room leaving not much else the way of smell besides a faint trace of smoked meat I believe was bacon. Following in suit was thee smokiness that dominated the flavor. I started to detect slightly sweet dark fruity malt notes as well as a bit of caramel as this warmed and some of the smoke died down. A bit of a smoky aftertaste lingers around after each sip. This was about lighter medium bodied and hard good carbonation and a smoky coating feel to it. Pretty drinkable stuff once the smoke mellowed out, definitely a beer I would have to be in the mood for. Overall an excellent beer that delivers on the rauchbier experience. I would like to try it next time with some smoked meat as the scent and flavor would seen to go perfectly with it.","Sterling, Virginia, USA","meathookjones"
3073,"2004-12-14",4.2,"Well it looks like a barbecue beer in the glass. Deep brown and great head. The nose is a knockout. This is a truly unique beer that has a great depth of character.

3073,"2004-10-20",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2010 from old notes Brown hue with burgundy highlights under a beige cream.  Cinders and caramel from the start, a savory edge, then deep cocoa.  Rich, malt and toffee sweetness, dark chocolate, mildly smoky  near sharp acidity keeps it lively, lengthy roast and smoke aftertaste.  Creamy with lively carbonation on a medium-thick body.  

A vivid mix of aromas and flavors; dangerously sessionable.

50 cl bottle, best before April 2009.

Pint bottle, snifter.  Not as smokey and bacony as I remember the other Aechts being.  Some chocolate and molasses are behind the smoke (I think!).  There are some prunes also.  Overall, a dirty, smokey, earthy aroma.  Husky brown-red body with a glacieresque creamy, brown head.  Lightly sweet, moderatley acidic, moderately bitter (burnt) flavor becomes a moderately acidic, heavily bitter (burnt) finish.  Medium body, creamy/slick texture, lively carbonation.  The bottom line is: a little sharp by itself, but would likely be great with salmon or gouda!

Rerate on 7/6/05: Not much more to say about the beer, I just enjoy it a heck of a lot more.  Moving it up from a 3.8 (8/4/7/4/15).  (1 / 8 / 18 / 1 / 14 / 92)","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

The beer is a nice dark brown color with a medium beige head and thin lacing. The aroma is equal parts ashtray smoke and Purina Beggin Strips.  Medium-bodied with a very smoky character, as a matter of fact it dominates everything else in the beer. The finish is more of the same. I think my wifes question of why I smelled like a cigarette (I dont smoke) after drinking it about sums it up. Its just too much.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

3073,"2004-10-03",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2005 

The color was a reddish brown. Healthy head with some lacing. 

Staggering aroma. The smokiness from the beechwood smoked barley and the sweetness from the traditional bock malts (Dont know what they are) made this honestly smell like barbeque ribs. Very smoky in the aroma with underlying notes of cherry, chocolate, caramel and grapes.

Previously I have had the weizen from this brewery and the smokiness is much milder in the bock. Very juicy. Very smoky. Ripe fruits and smoked bacon dominate the palate. 

This beer was awesome.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
3073,"2004-09-30",4.5,"Beautiful color that can be best described as burnt amber.  The body was clear and was topped with a foamy tan head.  The head thinned out, but never quite died.  The aroma is that of an intensely smoky grill sprinkled with sugar.  The sweet and acrid smell hit me at an arms length and nearly put me into a higher orbit with its intensity every time the glass touched my lips.  The taste was just as good as the smell with a caramelized sweet maltyness and a smoky bitterness.  There were some mildly grassy hop presence, but that was only a secondary pleasure.  The mouthfeel was full and satisfying, and the smoky aftertaste lingered on forever.  Very good and intricate beer that is the best of the Rauchbier offerings in my opinion.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

3073,"2004-08-18",5.0,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2013 updated rating: i finally had this in season at schlenkerla and was blown away. it emerged from the oak cask a rich jet black with a bulbous beige head, leaving thick texta lines of lacing. bottled schlenkerla beers tend to show their age in their aroma quite quickly with some creeping splintered woodiness that is thankfully largely disguised by the smoke; fresh on tap the aroma is simply a delight - beer-marinated spare ribs, wet grass thrown on a fire, honeyed rye, old well, muddy gumboots. drinking this is like the entire process of smoked food in reverse - starting rich, smoky, sticky and meaty, and ending up in a scenic grassy field wide-eyed with wonder. perhaps the most impressive feature of this beer is its sheer drinkability - a litre disappeared in no time and i expect the same will be true of the 5 litre party keg that i see before me now (a steal at 14 euros). urbockzeit will be a permanent fixture on my beer calender.     
old rating: never managed to find this in bamberg so i was glad to see it in san francisco. not the freshest bottle but the aroma was still a treat, burnt hay and bacon. a little sweeter than expected, rotting fruit and a little chocolate crackle and pear, lightly salty dryness, looking forward to a fresh one some time, hopefully in october at the brewery","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"

3073,"2004-07-26",3.2,"Well, the smoke was indeed very powerful. It was also quite a different type of smoky flavor than the Cone Smoker, Rogue Smoke Ale, or any other Rauchbier Ive tried. I got a definite grapey taste from the smoke. I dont know if I would call it a good taste, but it certainly did the job of concealing the alcohol behind it.","Georgetown, Indiana, USA","barenada"
3073,"2004-07-20",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2007 Has a smokey smell kind of like smoked bacon or beef jerkey. The aroma was intimidating, it took me 5 minutes before I even took a sip after smelling it. It is a great aroma, but not an aroma I want in a beer. Dark brown in color. Has a smoke taste. Would be great for marinating ribs or other such foods. I dont feel this is a good drinking beer. It has to be paired with something to be good.

3073,"2004-06-20",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2010 Pours a deep unfiltered brown with absolutely no-head. Very little CO2. Aromas of a great BBQ. Fat sweet malt with tons of smokiness. This beer would be awesome for marinating. Very sweet with no hints of hops but a ton o smoke. Not really offensive though, but it does take some getting used to.  A sipper, perfect with some bratwurst or blood sausage.

Re-rate (10/20/10) Pours a deep ruset brown with one of the most stable tan heads I have ever seen. Just beautiful. So many varied smokey aromas... burnt caramel, gouda, bacon with a great deal of fresh from the oven bread. The flavors are semi-sweet. Truly one of the finest balances in any German beer labeled ""bock"". In no way is this cloying at all. Balanced perfectly by a moderate bitterness but no hop aroma. This completely relies on the character of the malts. There is no fermentation character at all. No esters, phenols, sulphur, nothing. Just beautiful malt. The palate is chewy, maybe the very definition of chewy. Mouth-filling with an amazingly creamy carbonation. This is rustic and beautiful. One of the greatest lagers on earth.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"

3073,"2004-05-09",4.3,"Ruby brown. Generous off-white head receding to a big ring. Aroma is heavily smoky, youve got to like this aspect. Theres just tons of ham, bacon, pork. Its intensely meaty and feels like a meal in itself, very expressive and one that you can smell from far. In this ragard, this can do wonders as a welcome home beer or a barbecue apetizer. It remains rather sweet too with its maple suggestions, peppery and salty, theres even leather and woody flavours in there. This is pretty complex with tons of character. The oldest sharp smoked cheddar youll come across. Body is medium-thick, fulfilling with a bit above average carbonation. Mild bitterness in the finish balances from the rather sweet malts. Fantastic. Probably the smokiest beer on the planet and it will never get on your nerves. Actually, I wished some brewery would make something smokier and as pleasant than this, but this is an old mans daydream. Nevertheless, this remains the father of smoked beers and an experience to enjoy as often as possible. A truly unique product of great appeal.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

3073,"2004-04-28",4.1,"Bottle (no date): Pours with a nice amber/egg-white head that is moderately diminishing.  Very smokey aroma that I expected, notes of burnt wood, sausage, earth, matchstick, and barely discernable notes of malt.  The taste of this beer is more well-rounded then the Marzen they brew.  Initially bitter and smokey, it very quickly changes to slightly sweet malty wood tones (oak, maple?, ash?), and spicey flavors.  Aftertaste is a pleasant smokey bbq-like flavor that lasts just long enough to make you want another sip.  Very well balanced for a smoke beer.  Rerate: Wow.  As this stuff warms up to room temp. it is taking on an almost port-like quality to the taste.  Interesting, I will have to get more of this and try it with cigars (too much smoke? well see).  This beer is a hell of a change up from the normal, although I wouldnt drink it everyday.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

Although I knew that ""rauch"" was going to have something to do with smoke (""nicht raucher""), I was quite unprepared for the intense bacon flavour. How could a beer be intended to taste of meat? And, even if that as intended, could it be palatable. Well I did enjoy it once the shock had passed. I guess rauchbier is something you either love or hate. I fall into the former camp. This was a rare opportunity to sample a strong rauchbier on draught (using a strange siphon/bicycle pump type contraption on top of the barrel) in the UK and very impressive it was too.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

Aroma is powerful, thick, pervasive, but not all smoke.  There is some rich malty goodness, almost a winey smell and some sweet nutty aroma.  Beautiful deep deep dark cherry red, burnt white head, but quite clear.  Flavor is smoke, tobacco, rich malted barley, bocky, winey sweetness.  Towards the finish I even got some hops out of it.  Its just so incredible that you can pick out the bock flavors (just like you can pick out the marzen qualities in the marzen version).  Superb and even better with some rich, sharp cheese.  Stone porter be damned, this aint subtle, but the flavor is unmatched.2004 or 2005 bottles not sure.  Having had this a good deal more, I can honestly say Im pulled more towards the more balanced marzen.  Granted these beers arent really about balance in the strict sense of the word, but a well-aged marzen really seems to have a bit better beer characteristic.  Still this is fantastic stuff.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Seriously, it reminds me of a smokehouse I used to visit in upstate NY.  The smoke lingers on the tongue and coats the mouth but is not at all unwelcomed.  Really a treat.  There is a certain dry sweetness that pervades the thick palate, reminds of cured pork fat and dark/bitter chocolate.  An excellent occasional beer and one that I can bust out a big ol' stein for (unfortunately I don't really know what it looks like thanks to the stein, but I'll assume is looks great beneath that massive frothy tan head).","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

3073,"2003-12-30",3.6,"Clearish dark reddish brown color with a small beige foamy head that fades out quickly leaving some good sticky sheets and strings of lace. Aroma is quite unique with a smokey twinge rendering some hints of bacon, bar-b-que sweetness, and wet ashes. Not much else really comes through but the smokened senses which isn't all that bad but would have liked to seen some more complexity within the aroma with some malts or something. Taste is sweet and tangy with a smokey character that adds subdued salty meats, touches of bar-b-que or mustard sauces, charcoal, and jerky. Overall its not really coming across as anything else but smoke for character, which is fine, but I'd like to see an already good beer then add touches of smoke then take a subpar beer and add lots of smoke to cover up the fact that its really not all that good to begin with. And thats what I'm perceiving with this. Feel is lighty creamy with tangyness and quite smooth and close to medium bodied but has some slight watery notions late in the finish. An OK beer to have an occasion but more or less I think I'll use it to marinate and cook up some porkchops or steak with. I think it'll work very well in the that department.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

The dark red walls are coated with thick mahagony smoke, only the white carpet remains its original color.   As I ride up Wildcat ready to pound the Hoe and its 36 new Inches i'm overpowered with the smell of smoke.   The ride down is continuous over the head face shots from Punch Bowl to Pot Smokers finishing on Blackjack.   As i skate back to the line i bust out a Toblerone bar i find in my jacket half open.  The strong flavor chocolate and caramel is topped with a thick smokyness.   Once in line one of the drunk monoskiers gives me a swig of his Optimator he bought at Joanies.

3073,"2002-12-02",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2008 Bottle... This beer rocks... The aroma is heavily malty, but that’s not really the issue here. Do you like the aroma of mesquite BBQ?

A truly beautiful beer.  Crystal clear crimson hue. Large, frothy, off-white, mostly lasting head that is mostly lasting. Decent lacing.
The flavor is not extremely complex. A matter of taste, really.
Heavy malt. Heavy hickory/mesquite smoke up front. The hops balance out this smoke-laden nectar.  However, you can run, but you cannot hide from the sweetness of the barley malt.  The hops can’t control it, they can only hope to contain it. Forget about it!  The sweet malt wins out in the end.

I think theyre all novelties, in a derogatory sense.  I got sick of this beer halfway through the glass.  Smokiness is neat...for a few minutes.  This is definitely worth trying, but I dont think it belongs anywhere near the 97.5th percentile in which its rated.

inceribly well balanced malt/smoke/bitterness
lingering smoketaste in the top of the mouth.
Body is on the thinner side. Yum.

Vertical tasting 2003 
vs. 2004
Aroma: The younger bottle shows a more fruity malt and bittering hops, the old one exposes more acidic notes.
Appareance: 2003 is definetly cloudier 
than the young version, also the head stability is better in the young one - I am wondering whether  this is due to the additional lagering or a different way of production. 
Flavor: The young one has more fruit and bittering hops. The smoke has changed a bit as the 04 version has more burned flavors whereas the old one is a bit more soft and wooden.
Palate: To be honest I can not find much difference in mouthfeel and body.
Overall: Both brews are brilliant and I have a hard time saying which one is best - probably the young one is a bit more pleasant to drink as it balances the smoke  better with fruit and bitterhop taste.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","jonas"

It takes copious amounts of melanoidins to elevate rauchbier into something magical, and while this exhibits a hint of them, it leans toward the sweeter and fruitier side of the spectrum.  But what it lacks in beefy malt-driven complexity makes up for it nicely with its idiosyncratic pen ink, shoe polish and molasses-steeped plum dimensions.  Perhaps not overly complex and not the cleanest, but certainly a beer with plenty of soul to complement the immense depth. Even at its immodest strength, my half-liter glass always finds itself in need of a refill within minutes.  Great beer.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3073,"2002-02-13",0.5,"just wretched. the taste reminded me of the time in cubscouts when i dropped a hotdog in the fire then ate it - A greasy-charred taste that did not go away for a day and a half.  Now, i am willing to experiment and try every beer that i can get my hands on, this is the only one of about 350 that I really dont want to try again.   Sorry, this one is not for me.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
3073,"2002-02-07",3.9,"I love this stuff more than anything when I am having BBQ or smoked salmon.  The urbock is not as good as the marzen IMO but it is still quite decent.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"
3073,"2002-01-27",4.9,"UPDATED: OCT 6, 2004 I love Rauchbier so my review is a bit colored.  Schlenkerla Urbock is an outstanding example of the style.  There is no point in me telling you that the beer is smoky, as you should already know this, or have read the other reviews.  But it is also well balanced, the smoke is prominent but not overwhelming. I could actually use more smoke!  You can tell that this would be a good beer without the smoke.  It's not as if they just dumped in some Liquid Smoke.  I don't drink Rauchbier as a curiosity, I drink it for the whole picture, which is a good beer brewed in a different style.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
3073,"2002-01-21",3.8,"Big beer! Lots of malt, smoke and alcohol. Lingering sausage like smokey flavour. This beer is not exactly allabout balance, its about new taste experiances.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
3073,"2002-01-14",3.9,"Nice lighter brown color, with a slight head.  Aroma is, of course, smoky, with a touch of malt sweetness.  Flavor profile follows the aroma very closely, as well, with a touch of sweetness mingling with the smoked darker malt flavors.  Finish is very long, and as someone else pointed out, rather wet.  Very smooth all the way through, and the smokiness kind of fades in the aftertaste just before a bit of hoppiness and some nice malt flavors shine through.  I am again suprised at how much I like rauchbier, although I am sure to keep my exposure to it at a minimum (familiarity possibly breeding negative things; I have a similar attitude about Pink Floyd).","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
3073,"2002-01-14",4.1,"Like drinking smoked bacon, but in a good way. Nice copper to brown color, with a hickory smoked, camp fire aroma and taste. Complemented perfectly by a nicely marinated filet mignon, grilled to perfection in my backyard.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
3073,"2002-01-02",1.1,"Tastes like liquid smoke.  I cant say this is a bad beer because that would not be fair.  I just have never been able to take the flavor of liquid smoke & that is what this tasted like.  It churned my stomach!","USA","ToddR"

3073,"2001-12-13",4.1,"Malt is just packed with smoke. Tastes like a campfire, which I like. Didnt seem to be amazingly complex flavor-wise in my opinion but was well balanced..and definitely was a campfire in a glass.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
3073,"2001-12-07",4.8,"UPDATED: JUN 27, 2004 Bottled. Deep ruby red, creamy lasting thick off white head and good condition.  Luscious sweet malty nose with big, big wood smoke aromas, some background buttery creaminess and maybe even a trace of hop, but I wouldn't swear to it. Full bodied with massive but beautiful bitter woodsmoke and sweet melanoidin malt in the mouth and a touch of roast barley becoming apparent. Long woodsmoke in the finish with roast barley and sweet fruity malt. Stunning, and even better from a wooden cask. Maybe this year I will get back to try it again....","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"

This beer is incredible to me..it has a sweet malty backbone, smoky notes are interwoven through out the entire taste, incredible  creamy mouthfeel and huge body, even some quiet hints of chocolate,slightly hoppy finish even without the smoke i think this would be a first rate bock...with everything thats going on, this beer is amazingly drinkable...a gift from the beer gods.......","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"

3073,"2001-08-24",5.0,"OHMYGOD.  The aroma is smoked cheddar and hickory-smoked bacon; the flavor a mix of sweet (maple, chocolate) and smoky, slightly bitter malt and wheat.  With this complexity and sweetness, youd think it would be a special occasion beer suitable only with certain foods or in front of a roaring fire -- youd be wrong.  My current favorite beer (and brewery!), justifiably occupying a spot in our collective top 10.  The finish is perfect, with just a hint of lingering smokiness -- this must be what smokers of fine cigars experience!","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
3073,"2001-08-07",4.5,"A truy awesome beer.  If I ever make it back to Germany I WILL go to Bamburg to drink it.  Make me want to eat smoked cheese.  Find a girl who like this and youre set for life.","Passaic, New Jersey, USA","SNIAT"
3073,"2001-07-24",5.0,"This smoky beauty devastated me on the first sip. Even pouring it was a real treat - gorgeous color, just the right amount of head. As others have noted, its a real food-accompanying sort of beer - it just cries out for robust meats and fish. This Urbock deserves to be a legend.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","baseballguy"
3073,"2001-07-23",5.0,"Like so many of the finer things in life, the first bottle of this stuff is awful.  The smoke is overwhelming and unpleasant, and the result is a concoction worthy of the ole sink sacrifice. But give it just one more shot, and you will discover a beer of astonishing complexity, with varying layers of smoke at different stages of the tasting process. The underlying bock is of the highest quality.  Indescribably delicious with pork chops or smoked ham.  The best beer out of Germany, and a top five brew for me.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
