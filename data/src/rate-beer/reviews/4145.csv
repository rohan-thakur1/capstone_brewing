Couleur rougeÃ¢tre-acajou, dorÃ© au verre sur un filament huileux.
ArÃ´me est exceptionnel et complexe. Le tout se dÃ©veloppe sur plusieurs heures. En premier, je note surtout cette impressiond echipotle, ensuite un cÃ´tÃ© chocolat au lait et ponctuÃ© par unf ruitÃ© cerise renforcÃ©. Le tout sur une douceur mielleuse. Cette cerise tend Ã  prendr eun peu le dessus et au niveau des effluves on alterne chalaeur, fruitÃ©, chocolat et miel.
Palais est similaire. Complexe avec une chaleur des chipotle qui augmente avec la tÂ° ambiante du verre sans jamais tomber dans le surfait. A ce point, tout se complÃ©mente avec le cÃ´tÃ© chocolat ai lait qui donne son sens aux piments mais aussi Ã  la cerise. La barrique de NewHolland, sans y donner un cÃ´tÃ© biÃ¨re, donne le ton avec le cÃ´tÃ© lactose. La cerise donne ce profil lÃ©gÃ¨rement suret et cÂ’est sur toutes ses composantes que les saveurs entrechoquement pendant fort longtemps. JÂ’avoue avoir dÃ©guster un simple verre pendant 2-3 heures et cÂ’est intÃ©ressant de voir comment le tout Ã©voluÃ© avec le temps alternant entre doux, suret, boisÃ© et fruitÃ©.

4145,"2014-07-17",3.9,"Pours from the bottle into a dark dark ruby almost hard to see the crimson without light. A really nice deep color with no head and little bubbles. The aroma is very interesting with many notes of peppers upfront mixed with an alcoholic honey all with a shy chocolate background. Flavors match the nose as initially a slight pepper hint mixed with a light chocolate flavor. Also some dark fruits sneak in. Very smooth and easy mouthfeel given the 14% abv. As soon as it hits the throat going down the spicy kick comes back at its peak. All the while a very soft feel as you would expect. It also leaves the spice on your lips well after the drink yet the chocolate flavor sticks around on the mouthfeel. Almost like drinking Cherry Chipotle with a chocolate dessert. I like how the chocolate flavors take the backseat here letting the spice and honey fruitiness take control while keeping a balance. I definitely like it. The price is a bit high but for sure worth a shot.","Michigan, USA","SpongeRuiner"

4145,"2014-05-12",4.5,"Multiple bottle pours at the Spring Mead Fest. Pours blood red with no carbonation. Looks sorta thick and syrupy. Really cool appearance. Aroma is rich dark cherries with chocolate, oak, and light smokey peppers. Taste blew me away. Rich, moderately sweet cherries, musty honey, and oak. The chocolate and smokey peppers show up on the back end. Just the slightest bit of heat from the peppers. Get a little tartness from the cherries too, especially when warmer. Great syrupy mouthfeel. Kinda sticky. Amazing mead that somehow improved on the already awesome Cherry Chipotle.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
4145,"2014-05-11",4.2,"Bottle at Mead Fest. Brownish red color with no head. Aroma has chocolate, tart cherry and some oak. The flavor is similar to the original chocolate, cherry mead with and extra chocolate/oak kick. Starts with slightly tart cherry and honey flavor with a hint of spice. As it sits on your tongue, the smooth chocolate and oak flavors pop up. Really well done.","Ohio, USA","OPIE788"
4145,"2014-05-10",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 11, 2014 Pours red. Aromas of chipotle, cocoa,and minor cherry. Flavor is full on chipotle, earthy with a blast of heat. Cherry is there with a big blast of cocoa and woody character. Nice.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
