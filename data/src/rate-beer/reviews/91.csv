The nose shows a mix of kumquat, honey, and a tart acetic edge. Comes together quite strangely, but Im guessing its the pumpkin. 

The palate is highly carbonated and light bodied. Lightly tart with flavors of moderately intense orange tea and light malts that mix quite well together. Light oak in the background. Not bad for a pumpkin sour actually.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
91,"2016-10-31",3.3,"750 ml bottle from Artale in Rockford, IL, served a bit below cellar temp in a Chouffe tulip. Bright amber-orange, hazy to the point of opacity, with a moderate fully lasting white head...tart fruit nose comes off as all Flanders red / sour brown at first, but a bit of pie spicing does show up eventually and remains weakly present; perhaps it serves to blunt some of the sharpness of the yeasty/tart/acidic notes both here and on the tongue...which is, again, more reminiscent of an oude bruin than anything else; if there is any pumpkin here it is only noticeable in a slight vegetal quality to the malt, which is not unpleasant but doesnt really do anything special either...overall, its sharp, very mineralic and bitter at the finish, with virtually no trace of sweetness, highly acidic, and chalky/cottony going down...a touch oily and slick, full, strongly carbonated. Not really bad as a Flemish sour though not good either - if the pumpkin or spices (which I found little evidence of) did anything it was to mute the impact of the tartness, and yet the finish remains rough and hard.  



A half hour later...this improves considerably, the harshness at the finish smoothing out, the malts in the body enlarging their presence, and perhaps a bit of actual pumpkin flavor becoming faintly noticeable...I find that, at the least, I will be able to drink the bottle.  Still not great, but a bit more interesting and closer to decent than I had first imagined.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
91,"2016-10-27",3.7,"From notes. Enjoyed at Corbets house during a tasting on October 24. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a foggy golden yellow orange with a thick light gray colored head and a good lace as it falls down. The aroma is interesting. There is a light tart pumpkin to it, but its got a light fruitiness and then the funk rolls in. There is a light maltiness and a hint of biscuit on the back end. This is not as bad as I thought it would be. Lightly tart, but not awful. The flavor is much of the same. Light tropical fruits start off, leading into the sweetness of the pumpkin and a finish thats a little tart and spicy. The mouth feel is lighter and syrupy with a bright-ish carbonation and a lingeringly sweet and tart earthy squash. Its a really interesting beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

-  Theres some spiciness (nutmeg, cloves) but nothing overpowering. 
-  Moderate sourness that fits pretty well with the on-purpose oxidation.

91,"2014-10-29",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2015 750 mL bottle poured into a tulip. The aroma is rather complex, and it?s initially a pungent barnyard funk which fades a bit, but is present throughout. After the initial aroma, some caramel starts to poke through, but that soon gives way to bright vinegar, cider, and crisp white wine notes along with light citrus (lime, lemon, and orange can all, distinctly, be picked up). This then balances with the funk, but gives way to some candi sugar and some mellow pumpkin pie notes in the background with a woody cacao. The beer is topped by a big, frothy, off-white (almost orange) head that reduces slowly to a creamy, thick layer which is retained through out sitting atop a murky orange-yellow beer. A lot of ""fractured,"" webby, fluffy lace is left on the glass. The taste is a balanced, medium level of sweet and sour with a touch of bitterness. The medium light beer is fizzy and thin with a slight stickiness. The initial flavors are reminiscent of white wine with a tart citrus and dry woody spice finish. There?s a flash of  pumpkin pie at the tail end of the finish, but it doesn?t last . The dry and tart quality fades a touch during this flash, but comes back a bit as an aftertaste. After awhile those notes fades and a light, bittersweet chocolate character emerges and remains with a light candy-like sugar.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Tasted on 2/1/14 from a capped 750mL bottle purchased quite some time ago, this one has been in the cellar for quite a while. Pours clear burnt orange with a thick white head that very slowly recedes to average lace. The nose is really ripe with that great, signature JP funk, with a bit of richness and a touch of dusty chocolate (coming through more as the beer warms) and baking spices. The flavor is much more sour with the cocoa on the back of the palate. This beer is a bit richer than some JP that Ive had, I am guessing that can be attributed to the pumpkin. The body is light with nearly sparkling carbonation and a long sour, funky, and touch of rich cocoa finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

91,"2014-01-18",3.7,"Review from notes:

24oz pour on tap.

A - Hazy burnt orange with a small milky cap.

S - Acidic, sour pumpkin, various fall spices, allspice, nutmeg, lemons, old basement funk.

T - Lacto tartness right off the top, salty lemons, spices, follows the nose, allspice, nutmeg, light pumpkin in the background. Brett is heavy handed and brings in some basement funk. Finishes tart and crisp with ample dryness.

M - Light body, thin at times but it fits, low smooth carbonation, very dry finish.

This is my kinda Pumpkin Ale! Sour, dry, funky and spicy. The sour dominates with the pumpkin and spices lingering in the background and finally rounds out the finish with a crisp and snappy tartness. Awesome!

91,"2013-11-30",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Oak and citrusy funk dominate this Wild Ales light spiciness, as oranges tickle resurging citrusy tartness and even more oak. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sturdy head of foam covers the misty pumpkin orange.
-This is not as intense as most Jolly Pumpkin sours, which means its also more drinkable.
-Pumpkin in this beer seems to be irrelevant to the flavor profile.
-This is not nearly as chaotic as I expected it to be (based on what the label said was in this beer).
-Cocoa, really? Maybe in the finish if you really want to look for it...

91,"2013-11-10",3.5,"Aged 1 year (2012 vintage, batch ?): I was really hoping that this would be light on sourness... Something happened in my gut last month and I havent been quite the same. This ale from JP aged well for such a low ABV. Dark orange with a foamy, tinted white head, it sports some dark sediment that looks alot like cinnamon at the bottom of the glass. It smells a little sour, but not as harshly as youd expect, with flowers and perfume even stronger than the sour character. Its warm on the palate, a little fruity in flavor with that same rosy perfume character in the mouth. Fortunately the sourness doesnt weigh down my belly. Its still sour, though, and tart as well. Light bodied, but full in flavor and matured nicely after a year, this would be pretty good if you enjoyed sours. I used to, dont much anymore.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

A: La Parcela appears hazy and light orange in color, with an inch of dense, fluffy, white head atop the beer.

S: Slightly funky, with floral, grassy aromas.

T: The pumpkin flavor is very subdued. The beer is not sweet, as is typical of pumpkin ales in general. The flavor is very typically Jolly Pumpkin, with slightly funky brettanomyces and a saison-like character throughout. The pumpkin aspect is subtle and shows itself more in the finish.

M: Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation.

D: Certainly enjoyable and quite different from what one might expect from a pumpkin ale, but exactly what you would expect from Jolly Pumpkin.

Well, this is about as attenuated and sour as they come.  For many years Ive described Jolly Pumpkin as the American Fantome (which Ive heard Ron disagrees with, but its not meant in either a positive or negative way, its just an observation), and this is another perfect example of why.  Most brews are super dry and sometimes very sour, theyre usually farmy/rustic in character, both frequently use an assortment of not-always-common spices, and frankly, you never know what youre going to get from either brewery...sometimes the sourness is gentle, sometimes its off the hook.  Both sometimes make world class stuff, but it varies so much from batch to batch that its hard to predict if a batch/blend will be a drain pour or a winner.  That is, in part, the allure of both breweries.  Theyre mysterious and unpredictable.  This one didnt turn out so well, but its always a little exciting to see a new JP on the shelf.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

91,"2011-12-05",3.2,"Bronzed orange. Strikingly-ornate lathery white foam produces intricate lacework. Lurking beneath that telltale ""samey"" Jolly Pumpkin character of iron and peach (on the brink of rotten, in this case) are some hints of hazelnut, white pepper, dusty yeast, straw, and musty wood. Very mild note of band-aid and horse blanket. Compact carbonation. Somewhat airy with a wave of leather and unripe peach tartness kissed with a rose petal softness and band-aid-tinged phenolic clench. Very soft and well-integrated, though the tartness is very one-dimensional and shallow in the vain of iron / hibiscus / dried strawberry / unripe peach, and comes off as curiously mute. Malt showcases a grassy, fermenting-wheat tang, and some very distant but unappealing apple jelly / Red Delicious apple skin creeps in and imparts some perceptible limpness and dullness. Sadly, the pumpkin is essentially nonexistent. Oak fails to offer up any crispness of structure, and because the grains are on the flabby side, the body is consequently hampered. Malt does gain a bit of nutty heft as well as some vividness as it reaches cellar temperature, though it falls short of exceeding background levels or helping to allay the lurking phenolic harshness. Perfumey mace and white pepper lend some tingly zip to the underwhelming finish, which is largely comprised of flabby tartness. JP tends to be a very monotonous brewery, rarely brewing a batch that is truly exemplary or distinctly unique from its counterparts. And, sadly, La Parcela is no different. I iterate ""sadly"" primarily due to the price-point. Sure, blending is laborious and time-consuming, and the brewery is tiny, no doubt about it.  But with the kinds of prices commanded by the distributor / brewery, these guys ought to be releasing more home-runs rather than the all-too-seldom very good batch of beer.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
91,"2011-12-02",3.8,"The pour is a hazy, honey-amber color with a moderately full, pillowy, frothy head which settles to a thin froth and leaves just a bit of sporadic lace.

The flavor is similar with plenty of tart brett-like notes, still tart orangey notes, dry chocolate, some barnyard funk, and a fresh herb note of thyme.  The palate is less than medium, more than lively, drying a touch, and slick.  The finish is dry, tart with more orange, funky, and still thyme lingering.  I didnt really get the impression that this was a pumpkin beer nor a spiced one.  The chocolate was subtle but mostly it was another tart, brett-like beer from JP, which was enjoyable.

This is a typical jolly pumpkin wild ale in my eyes ; it has the same yeast/hop/malt profile that I am very used to. As far as the pumpkin notes, they are nearly impossible to find, and that is where I am not really impressed here. The pumpkins are a hint, the spices are a hint, and the cocoa is a hint.

91,"2011-11-11",2.8,"Poured into a snifter. Batch 862, Bottled 8-24-2011.

4.0 A: Reddish brown color. Nearly three fingers of foamy white head that retains well and leaves a a good bit of irregular lacing.

3.5 S: Well this definitely is a JP brew. Theres no doubt about that. But, if the label didnt contain Jack-o-Laterns staring at me, Id have no reason to think this was a pumpkin beer. There isnt much in the way of pumpkin and the spices provided come off ineffective. Theres hints of cinnamon and nutmeg, but I want these spices to hit me hard rather than being in a minor supporting role. Still, the nose is nice. Barnyard funk with hay and horse. Neutral, maybe lightly bready maltiness. Oak is very soft and the cacao softer.

3.0 T: Dry, biscuity maltiness. A lot more oak than in the nose. No signs of the cacao. Some of the pumpkin comes through, but none of the spices do. Barnyard funk, apple orchard, wild apple, pear, and lemony tartness. Aside from all but ignoring the pumpkin aspect, this isnt much of a wild brew either. Very tame and uninspired, but still tasty.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Could be creamier, but not bad.

3.0 D: Atrocious pumpkin beer and a solidly mediocre wild. JP makes some good beer, but this isnt one of them. Terrible price as well ($13).

91,"2011-11-01",4.2,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Tulip on Halloween.

Appearance: Cloudy orange with large, foamy, cream-colored head and great lacing rings.

Aroma: Expected sour aroma for a Wild Ale, with vinegar, cider, cherry and horseblanket. Some dry spiciness.

Taste: Taste is a little more complex and seems to have two primary layers. The first is sour and barely sweet, with apple cider, brett, vinegar and light caramel. The other layer is quite spicy and dry, and this where the nutty pumpkin and cacao subtly come into play.

Palate: Moderately high carbonation with a fairly light body. Long, lingering dry & tart finish.

Overall: This really should be classified as a Wild Ale, as that clearly takes precedent over the pumpkin and spices. Either way, this is a great and very refreshing beer.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

91,"2011-08-22",4.3,"Batch 617. Bottled on 9-01-10. 750ml capped bottle into a DFH signature glass. Purchased at a random liquor store in New Jersey. Havent seen this one around New England anywhere, and certainly not one with almost a year on it. 

A - Dark amber/orange cloudy body. Looks very much like a pumpkin. There is some soapy off-white foam that sticks around for a very long time. Crazy amount of lacing and retention. Layers are forming on the walls of the glass.

S - Extremely saison like. Citrus and yeast, with some bready malts. A bit of jolly pumpkin funk. This is all followed by a warming spiced squash presence. Its very faint and hidden though. Doesnt smell like a pumpkin ale, but it does smell amazing.

T - All the notes of a JP saison. Citrus, yeast, bready malts, and some light tart funk. The aftertaste is just amazing though. Light roasted squash, a hint of nutmeg and cinnamon, and the slightest nod of sweet cocoa. Its pretty phenomenal actually. The way it starts off so citrusy and fresh, and then this smooth aftertaste comes along that taste exactly like fall. The medium body is well carbonated.

O - This beer blew me away. Shattered my expectations. This is not so much a pumpkin ale, as it is a saison to enjoy during the colder months. It aged very well too. Perhaps the pumpkin and spice is more noticeable the fresher it gets? I hope so, and I plan on finding a bottle of this years batch to compare.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"
91,"2011-08-19",4.0,"(bottle, batch 610, bottled almost exactly a year ago on 08-20-2010)  Ive been waiting to give this a try for some time now.  Pours out a lightly hazed dark orange with a towering cream-colored head that possesses the consistency of shaving cream and leaves a ton of lacing.  So thick that its difficult to swirl.  Aroma has a bunch of oak, mustard, and vinegar with a good spice scent intertwined with these aromas.  Some pumpkin is lurking here, but its not the obvious sweet baked pumpkin scent found in many pumpkin beers, rather its earthy and smells like raw pumpkin.  I can also get the cocoa and it works really well with the nutmeg and raw pumpkin.  The flavor is less impressive, with some of the pumpkin appearing (sweeter in flavor than the aroma), with the cocoa following and the spice accenting.  Finish is big on oak, but its surprisingly not as dry as the aroma would lead on.  Peaks of acidity similar to white wine vinegar and mustard arise right before the oaky finish.  Minerals and gravel.  Cocoa carries on.  Mouthfeel is medium, a little thicker than most JP, and carbonation is soft (naturally).  Overall this is a good beer, but the taste fell a few points short of expectations, and the high price didnt help matters.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

91,"2011-06-19",4.0,"20110619  750ml from State Line, I believe.  Had bought six of these when it came out, and this is the last of them.  The deep orange-gold beer is lightly hazed with tall, lasting, creamy off-white head of large, building foam.  Aroma is spicy and very lemony, sourdough, Bretty botanicals,coriander.  Im sorry to see I hadnt rated this when fresher, because its quite a bit different now that its older.  Not at all suffering from age, the stuff is delicious, dry, and typically refreshing as are so many of the JP brews, but when it was younger there was a certain squashy undertone and light sweetness, but it seems to have perhaps fermented away now.  There is still a soft retronasal note that reminds me of spicy hot cocoa, the chili pepperiness of that subdued from how I recall it (not spicy, but verdent).  Nonetheless, theres nothing wrong with this, and Ill be keeping an eye out for some clearance prices on these bottles now that its so old.  Rating of 4.0 based on the run of bottles Ive had, though this one would probably only tally a 3.6 or so.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
91,"2011-06-16",4.2,"THOUGHTS: Rather sour. I dont really see the point of making a pumpkin beer that barely, if at all, tastes or smells like pumpkin or pumpkin pie spices. Dont get me wrong, it was a great beer, but its not really a pumpkin beer and should probably be put in the sour/wild ale category. It was similar in flavor and aroma to other Jolly Pumpkin beers, but it was much lighter in the flavor department. It had some of the best head and lacing Ive ever seen in a beer.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a hazy, medium, brownish orange with a large to huge, creamy, off-white head that diminished very slowly and kept a decent sheet that left excellent lacing that was thick and clingy. The aroma had apple, wood, sour apple, tons of sour fruit, spices and a little cocoa right at the end. The initial flavor was slightly sweet, light to moderately acidic and moderate to heavily sour; while the finish was moderate to rather acidic and heavily to nearly harshly sour with a long duration. There was sour apple, some spices, slight hints of pumpkin and cocoa, more sour fruit, dusty yeast and sour grapes.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

91,"2011-06-14",3.1,"This bier has an awesome label.  The lit pumpkins, the haunted ""parcela"" of pumpkin patch, the silhouetted scarecrows and trees.  AWESOME!  The bier itself, poured from a 750ml bottle, is a little less awesome.  Mostly I taste sour.  Not a mouth-puckering super sour, but a lower-middle range sour that your palate gets used to after 4 or 5 sips.  Then the malty, cacao taste comes through very delicately----I wish there was some more cacao, but its adequate.

Well, I dont smell any pumpkin in this beer.  It smells like tart apples, funk, lemon peel, and some nutmeg (which I dont notice until after the beer has been opened for a while).  Taste is just like the aroma, its mostly sour and funky until the beer has warmed up more and then the pumpkin spices are a little bit noticable.

Aromas have a nice pucker to them with a bit of apple cider, some sort of odd cinnamon type spicing (almost like a very faint and sour pumpkin pie, but that might just be suggestive from the name.)  Flavor is just right.  A nice sour apple dominant backbone with little side-currents of pie spice.  My only regret on this one is that it seems a bit watery at times... the flavor is full, but it doesnt stick around on the palate for long.

91,"2011-01-20",3.5,"Batch 610. Bottled On: 8/13/10.

Appearance: Pours a nearly clear, coppery body with a very tall, wispy, near-white head.

Smell: Lightly bready barley, maybe a sprinkling of wheat and hewn hay, infused with a note of oak barrels and hints of tartish green apples and shaved sour lemons. Any scents of pumpkin or spice certainly come across last and least appreciable.

Taste: Mild bready maltiness coupled with very mellow, very subtle spices and a nudge of lactic lemon. Staunchly dry throughout, with nearly no sweetness cross the tongue. Placid oak wood and faint earthiness midway. A sip of juiced Granny Smith apples rolls out a growing tartness (though never very much) on the back half with a sustained lactic touch. Occasionally, I perceive a vague vegetal, squashy tone, but I fear thats only because Im looking long and hard for it. Gentle tartness on the rather dry finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-high carbonation.

91,"2010-11-27",4.3,"Aroma: Sour, barnyard, pumpkin pie, allspice.

Appearance: Cloudy copper pour. Dense, tawny head with excellent retention and lacing.

T: Tart, horse blanket, allspice, pumpkin pie (slight). As the brew warmed, the pumpkin pie charcter increased a bit, though not as ""pumpkiny"" as some others of the style Ive had, such as Southern Tiers Pumking

P: Well carbonated, nicely dry finish, well-balanced.

OA: Im a huge fan of JPs ales, and this one is no exception. Id class it as more of a sour rather than in the vegetable/spice/herb class. The pumpkin is muted and the sour really overshadows it.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","allfreej"

Flavor is toasty, good funk, bretty, with light pumpkin spicing, zesty tart twang towards the middle and end, with a slight cherry pie funkiness, and a mostly dry crackery finish.

I was concerned at first by the apparent ""Brett"" flavor because Im not a big fan of this, but it is perfectly balanced here with the spices, malt and everything else going on here.  In fact, I wonder if this is the pumpkin coming through and not yeast as it can have this effect.

Flavor is also sour, tart, and fruity, with spices, sweet and toasted malts, funk, and more pumpkin than the nose.  Light-bodied, with subtle but crisp carbonation and an apple juice mouthfeel.

91,"2010-10-04",4.0,"Sour and funky aroma. I like it! Pours a rich amber color with modest head that dissipates quickly. Sour tasting with the Jolly Pumpkin house funk. Not a lot of pumpkin flavor at first, just a nice tart/sour malty flavor. After the initial sourness goes away, a very nice pumpkin and chocolate aftertaste remain. Once you know what to look for, the pumpkin has a fresh from the garden character. This beer is not the typical pumpkin pie spice beer we get this time of year, but is a very subtle and complex beer that gives you something new to discover the more you look for new things to discover. Its odd, I love this beer and it is more complex than other pumpkin beers, but in a pumpkin beer competition it would not do well because the pumpkin is not in your face.","Missouri, USA","MissouriBrent"

Softly fruity finish with a touch of soft tartness.  Lean body despite the soft sweet flavour.  Lingering minerally/minty finish.  Really awesome stuff.

Deep golden-amber pour.  The nose has a lot of soft sourness and vineous tartness.  Softly lactic character and a fairly wild flavour.  A little bit of light oakiness as well as some wheaty spiciness.  The smell is great but something about the flavour just doesnt sit right with me.

91,"2010-08-20",3.6,"750 ml bottle. This one pours a hazy, dark orange color and topped by a small, bubbly off white head that settles quickly to a thin film. The aroma shows that classic JP funk with notes of earthy spices and oak along with notes of pumpkin, tart fruits, and a cereal grain malt base. Cinnamon, clove, and cocoa also add to the spice mix. The flavor follows and is slightly tart from citrus fruits to go with the cereal grain and pumpkin flesh. Notes of cinnamon, clove, and cocoa come through as well.

91,"2010-05-24",4.1,"sampled from bottle.  faint haze of suspended yeast gives it a dull but glowing bronze/orange color with a small off-white head.  initial impression of the nose is of how delicate and soft the spices are layered on top of whats already a very delicate and soft yeast: the ""with spices"" is most definitely pumpkin spice (with nutmeg being most pronounced and cinnamon perhaps present in very small quantity).  texture is spot-on for JP: intensely delicate natural carbonation with a soft chewiness from the yeast.  extremely well-attenuated, the malt sugar seems nearly completely fermented out (which makes me curious how strict JP are about the use of speciality malts, or if they are simply just masters of mash and temperature rests - perhaps the most skillful at this process of anyone outside of europe). very low apparent unfermentable sugar present. cocoa is pretty much unnoticeable, while the oak barrel wood character (which overall is fairly light) and the subtle acidity (much closer to wine acidity than beer; i.e. not sour) from the inoculated barrel are fantastically balanced and in harmony with the other two major arms of this beer: the pumpkin spice and high attenuation.  damn fine stuff.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

The aroma reminds me more off a spiced cider with apples, cinnamon, cherries, and citrus.  The brett and tartness are also there with the usual JP funkiness.  Everything works well together.  The flavor has many similarities with the nose.  The tart citrus and brett show themselves quickly before this reverts back to the spiced cider that came though in the nose.  This is at times sour, while at others the cinnamon and other flavors seem to dominate.  The JP funk is present, but the whole pumpkin thing seems to be missing.  There are some bready malt notes and toasted sensations that come through late.  Medium bodied and very drinkable.

91,"2010-01-06",4.1,"Batch 436 / 437; Sampled December 2009
A solid pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a fat, two finger thick, pale amber, lightly tan colored head that leaves some lacing as it slowly subsides.  The beer is a combination of rich copper and amber hues that shows a lightly hazed, gold-copper hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of spicy nutmeg, sweetly vegetal pumpkin meat, a touch of spicy ginger, some white pepper, hints of cinnamon, brown sugar, light toasted grain notes.  Really though this beer smells of a light spiciness and caramelized pumpkin flesh; it is pretty nice and I like the light hand with the actual spices, plus I think the fermentation provided some of the spice notes too.

Surprisingly dry tasting, considering the nose, and there is a nicely soft tartness that says this wasnt fermented in a ""clean"" Sachoromyces only brewery.  The spiciness comes through in a much more peppery, ginger kind of way in the flavor due to the lack of sweetness.  There is still a touch of pumpkin flesh flavor in the finish, but it is much more subtle.  The beer has a nice texture to it; the fair amount of carbonation couples with the light tartness to bring a peppery sharpness to this as it rolls across the tongue; this is definitely a lighter feeling brew, but it easily keeps from seeming thin.  In fact there seems to be a touch of malt viscosity without any accompanying sweetness.  The peppery note couples with a soft woodiness.

My second pour of this that is drunk quite soon after the pour, is a bit too fizzy and carbonated; luckily a quick swirl of the glass releases the extra carbonation.  The tartness is definitely lactic in nature, which pairs well with the rest of the beer.  Perhaps a touch of lighlty smoky phenolics are noticeable as the beer warms up, but this can be exceedingly fleeting.

This is an exceedingly fantastic Pumpkin beer, definitely one of the best commercial examples that I have ever had.  I like how appetizing and ""sweet"" the aroma smells, but that the flavor is dry, tart and not anywhere near over-spiced.  The aroma actually reminds me of desert (perhaps obviously), but the flavor is, in the end, quite savory.  I am definitely quite pleased to be drinking a bottle of this right now.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
91,"2009-12-30",3.8,"750mL bottle, batch 436/437. Pours a slightly hazy, effervescent, and bold golden-copper color; creamy off-white head with excellent retention and fine-bubbled lacing; a gorgeous pour. The aroma on this is gorgeous and essentially smells like a vibrant mulled apple cider: cinnamon, apples, and some solid citrus acidity (the brett and tartness is there, but it blends rather seamlessly with the apple cider character). Medium mouthfeel: lots of citrus acidity and tartness here: brett and aceto, almost definitely, with a nicely complex melange of contributing sourness; this isnt ultimately what Id consider a sour ale, and the mulled apple cider notes follow through from the aroma, along with plenty of cinnamon and toasty vanilla; light wood and funkiness; the core, honestly, is a bit hollow overall, and feels not entirely filled out; quite drinkable, nice funk, and a very solid contributing presence from the apple cider spicing.

91,"2009-11-29",3.8,"750 ml bottle from Binnys (Orland Park, IL). Excited for this one, and surprised to find it on the shelf! Pours a nice glowing orange, pretty hazy, amber notes with a big frothy white head that laces pretty well. Aromas are subtle pumpkin, cinnamon, and caramel, a bit of fruity banana ester I think, mixed with a tart wild yeast element, a bit funky and warm, vanilla, wild barnyard and straw, a bit fruity. Subtle, but still nice. Initial is subtle, some gentle barnyard funk and light tartness, underneath comes in caramel, vanilla, and pumpkin, light and subtle pie spice and sweetness, light bitterness and earthy hop on the backend, a nice light sourness and funkiness comes up over the top, takes the dominance, a touch of lemon spritz, straw and earthiness. The sweetness is really mellowed out by the wild yeast and wet wood. Light, very drinkable, flavors work very well together. Different than most, one of the best Pumpkin Ales Ive had.

Making a special trip just for this I was glad I did.  It is far from the best Jolly Pumpkin and also far from my favorite pumpkin beer but it is definitely an experience worth trying.  The brewery has thrown us all for a loop and done so in a fantastic way.  If you can get your hands on this before it is all tapped out do so.

Aroma / Appearance - The pint glass came filled to the top with only about a half inch of solid white head.  Underneath was an amber colored fluid body.  Nutmeg, spices and brown sugar gave away the intent.  However it felt more like a traditional Jolly Pumpkin than a seasonal release with the strong Beglian underpinnings.

Flavor / Palate - Lightly sour as most Jolly Pumpkin are the mouthfeel was very satisfying.  After a spicy start it wound down to a peppery finish.  Only lightly bitter (like sun tea) it reminds me more of a Flemish sour than a pumpkin ale.  I prefer my pumpkin ales to be more pumpkiny which is probably why this doesn’t rate as highly.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
