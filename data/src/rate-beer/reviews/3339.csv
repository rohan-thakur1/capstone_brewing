3339,"2016-07-26",3.9,"On tap at Arizona Wilderness, pours a clear copper with a small white head. Aroma brings out lots of spicy earthy rye upfront, followed by piney hops and biscuity malt. Flavour is dry and punchy, with lots of piney hops, crisp crackery malt and a bone dry finish. About as good as session IPAs get. Full-bodied, dry and clean. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3339,"2016-07-25",3.6,"Tap at the source. Pours clear orange, sudsy white head. Aroma is rye, dank note, pine, orange citrus. Does not smell weak or watery at all despite the abv. Flavor is rye, lots of it, and lemon rind. Some pine. Definitely more watery in the flavor but its sub 4% so not bad there. Solid rye.","New York, USA","SG111"
3339,"2015-08-22",3.6,"A lightly hazed golden ale with a thin off white head. In aroma, nice fruity biscuit malt with grassy floral hops with light citrus pulp and funky notes, very nice. In mouth, a nice refreshing session ipa with light biscuit malt, grassy floral hops and grapeskin notes, light citrus pulp, nice and refreshing for summer weather. On tap at brewery.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
3339,"2015-07-29",3.9,"Draft. Bright copper hue with haze and a dense, frothy tan head. Great aroma -- toasty rye, peanut skins, biscuits, earthy/floral hops. The flavor leads with this blend as well, but floral hop bitterness takes hold mid-palate and carries the tongue into the exceedingly gentle finish. Combined with the down-soft, light body, the brew escapes the palate like evaporating water. Crazy-drinkable beer.","","PartyFowle"
3339,"2015-07-26",3.6,"Tap. Pours clear orange Amber, small beige head, decent lacing. Aroma is passionfruit, hints of pine, melon.

3339,"2015-07-10",2.9,"Smell is tropical fruit. Pineapple and banana maybe. Taste is light to moderate hops, a bit of malt, and light bread. Well made, but Im not a fan of hop forward beers. Medium carbonation with some foam.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
3339,"2015-03-06",3.9,"Tap at the source. Clear reddish amber pour with a small head that fades to a ring and leaves great lacing. Aroma is a nice mix of rye bread, tropical fruit, wood, and light caramel. Tastes like juicy oranges, grapefruit, and tropical fruit. Very nice caramel malt and rye too. Cant believe this is only 3.7%.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
3339,"2015-03-01",3.4,"Draft at the brewery. Pours clear bright copper with a fizzy white head. Tastes like nutty roasted malt, woody, dry straw, earthy. Light body and low carbonation. Smells like citrus hops, nutty malt, grapefruit, toast.","baltimore, Maryland, USA","snoworsummer"
3339,"2015-03-01",3.7,"Draft at brewery. Pours clear amber/light copper with creamy white head. Aroma is cereal and toasted malts, floral and spicy hops, light caramel, and light grapefruit.

3339,"2015-02-16",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2015 draft at brewery, this was a rock star. Great representation of the nelson hop with the light rye spiciness was a perfectly balanced nuance. The thinness and one-dimensionality that unfortunately comes with the session ipas was not here, feat that only a few breweries have mastered. Well done! The drinkability on this one is extremely high, a great beer for the area. I really like this one, it may be my favorite beer brewed in AZ so far.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3339,"2015-02-15",3.8,"Its all about drink-ability. This beer tastes good and went down smooth while drinking outside, enjoyed all 12-16 ounces I was poured. Now normally I pair with food, because lets be real if there was a ratetreats.com I would be the #1. Didnt eat here but the wings are good!","","Drunkdietitian"
3339,"2014-10-13",3.8,"Tap. The look is clear, copper colored, off white head. The smell is fruit, hops, grassy, peach, apricot, and good. The taste is bitter, fruits, orange, good.","Dallas, Texas, USA","travita"
3339,"2014-09-21",3.0,"Nice and light. Aroma of hops and rye. Light copper color with a minimal head. A little too watery palate, but hey, its a session. Citrus hops up front with a light sweetness and peppery finish. Easy to drink with heavy food.","The Colony, Texas, USA","kevinator"
3339,"2014-08-24",4.3,"For a ""little guy"" with a low ABV, this sure has a lot of flavor. The hops pop, but are not overwhelming. Theres other flavor underneath that we couldnt quite place. not rye per se. Nice aroma; great consistency. Solid. Enjoyed at the brewery for my birthday.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","DMLINAZ"

3339,"2014-05-27",3.8,"64 FL. OZ. growler supplied by Daknole. Many thanks! To oversized brandy snifter, it pours an amber orangeade with which a snowy-white ringed head half a finger in length stood. Aromas of wheat malt, rye bread, cashews, meadowfoam honey, straw, Carapils, autumnal leaves, capers, green peppers, and marshmallow root. Tastes the same with the addition American hops, white tea, and coriander. Fluffy and clean. Yummy.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
3339,"2014-05-27",4.0,"Growler shared by Radarsock. Thanks, Andrew! Pours orange brown with a white head. Nice tropical fruit and citrus aroma. Flavor is rye spice up front, then sweet juicy mango. Pineapple too. Just enough grassy bitter in the finish to balance.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
3339,"2014-05-23",3.7,"Growler in Breckenridge with my dad. Pour is slightly hazy orange with small white head and good lacing. Big spicy hoppy, tropical fruits, pineapple, orange, lemon zest, and soapy aroma. Taste is soapy, spicy hops, bread, grass, light weed, lemons, and pineapples with a medium bitter finish. Light body with medium carbonation. Not the best session IPA I have had but still really tasty.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
3339,"2014-05-02",3.4,"On tap at Arizona Wilderness. Pours a deep amber, relatively clear, moderate carbonation, thin white head. Aromas of BIG rye grains. Smells like dry cereal...oats...hay...light citrus...caramel. Taste is pretty dry and earthy. Not a lot of hop profile...leans towards semi-sweet malted rye and light earthy spice. Finishes dry and earthy. Not my cup of tea, but not a bad beer.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

3339,"2014-03-24",3.9,"Location: Draft at the Brewpub, 3/7/14


Aroma: The aroma is rye bread, some grassy hops, pepper, and a little citrus

Appearance: It pours a clear copper-orange color with a small off-white head and light lace

Flavor: The flavor is balanced and clean, some light sweetness, rye/spice, and a light-mid bitterness

Palate: The body is light, but not watery, clean and easy drinking, with an average carbonation

Overall Impression: 
This is a really nice rye session IPA. Youd be hard pressed to find a more flavorful beer under 4%. I cant think of many (if any) off the top of my head.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
3339,"2014-03-21",3.7,"Draft in a taster at the brewpub. Pours a clear, bright copper with a small off-white head that laces the glass. Aroma of rye, leafy hops, some peppery spice to go along with the rye, and toasted malts. Flavor of rye and peppery spice, toasted malts, and leafy hops - yep, I guess that would be just like the aroma. Light-bodied, with a somewhat bitter, very moderately spicy mouthfeel and low to moderate carbonation. So good for 3.7%.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3339,"2014-01-23",3.8,"Arrives from the tap a brilliantly clear, red tinged, gold highlighted color and is topped by a thin light tan colored head (at least as evaluated from this dim bar). The aroma smells quite hoppy, which is quite nice, with notes of herbal pine, floral tropical fruit, wild citrus notes, and a skunky fruit note that I associate with NZ hops. This even has a dank, ""herbal"" hop character to it that adds an edge to the hop character here.

The body is quite light bodied, dry tasting, and has a prickly carbonation. The hop character is quite biting with an up front focus on bitterness, but a finish that screams of Nelson Sauvin; sort of peppery, wild funky fruit notes, greenly herbal in an unripe, but quite floral kind of fruit way, as well as having a hint of accentuating spicy grain character to it. There is an ample bitterness to this beer that is accentuated by the very light malt presence, but it is certainly not too much for a hop head. 

A simple quaffing beer that is just so damn drinkable and good. I really wish more beers like this were done here in the US. I like that there is just a bit of texture to this beer that keeps it from being watery, is this perhaps the rye?","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3339,"2013-12-18",4.0,"Light copper brown pour, nice fresh hoppy aroma, taste is very clean, packs a nice punch of hops and finishes with a mild crisp bitterness. Has a lot of punch and is extremely sessionable.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","kbudd19"
3339,"2013-11-27",3.8,"32oz growler thanks to Ibrew2or3. Pours super clear amber with thick, beige foam. Delicate, beautiful lacing. Nose is yellow bell pepper, grilled kumquat, fresh acidic fruit, big aromatic hops, fresh whole grain bread, raw fresh grain. Really excellent. Taste at first feels low abv, and holy crap it is low, with some rustic rye brread, bitter fresh grapefruit juice. Extremely sessionable with hefty bread crust and hop oil. Very clean, simple, hop forward, session Rye PA.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3339,"2013-11-27",4.1,"Pour is a copper and clear. Great lacing. Aroma is fresh cut grass, fresh bell peppers, grains. Taste is more of the fresh green grass, mild hops, citrus rind. Pretty bitter. The rye really comes through in the palate. Lots of flavor for such a low abv beer. Really nice.","Oceanside, California, USA","biggirlpanties"
3339,"2013-11-18",4.1,"Beautiful clear orange color with foamy white head. The aroma is a blast of clean hop aroma (maybe cascade? Im still getting used to identifying them.) The flavor is grassy and has a great level of bitterness.","Arizona, USA","JustDrinkIt"
3339,"2013-11-09",4.0,"Live rate while watching the Warriors vs Memphis. The growler pours with a clear copper body that supports a nearly bright white head of foam that quickly falls back to a ring. The aroma at first busts with an earthy freshly cut green bell pepper notes. Upon further inspection this is likely rye bread, yummy dank onion and a bit of citrus creating a rather unique and oddly inviting aroma. The taste begins with thin faintly sweet malts and a moment later it grows into spicy bitter hops, onion dank hops, a citrus bitterness and then into grassy earthy spicy rye that creates the same uniqueness as noticed in the nose. Great stuff with plenty of flavor and interest and full up hoppiness from bitter to a bit resiny to some pleasing flavor hops. The more I drink the more this comes across with a nice tangy rye bread sensation. I wonder what a touch more residual sugar might be like.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
3339,"2013-11-05",3.6,"Draft sample. Golden brown pour with a thin white head. Very sweet and hoppy aroma. Big hop bite at first but then you get a little rye and some spice in the finish. Citrusy backbone. Good.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"
3339,"2013-11-05",3.7,"On tap: The aroma consists of citrus, caramel, toast, light grapefruit, and rye. Its a transparent amber with a small white head that fades to a thin ring. There is some sporadic dotted lacing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with a quick dose of citrus and mild roasted notes. The finish has light-moderate grapefruit and a touch. Its light bodied with mild carbonation and a somewhat soft mouthfeel. Overall, a solid session brew with a good amount of flavor for such a low ABV.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3339,"2013-09-14",4.4,"Pours a copper like color with nice medium off white head. Aromas of toasted oats, malt, and a slight bitter hop and sweet malt presence. This is a dangerous beer! Huge flavors on the tongue and only coming in at a 3.7% abv! AZWBC is doing big things!!!!","Arizona, USA","kcorum10"
3339,"2013-09-14",4.1,"Growler from daknole - thanks! clear copper, with a nice white head. Smells like molasses, steel, and rye toast. Very crisp and quaffable. Some firm malts and lightly spicy hops. Some notes of pine and citrus. Lots of ""pop"", if that makes any sense. I would drink a ton of this if it were available here.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
3339,"2013-09-12",4.2,"Copper, translucent in color. Small white head. Fizzy small bubbly carbonation. Thin mouthfeel, lots of hops, and rye and spices not much sweetness.

3339,"2013-08-24",4.3,"On draft at the brewpub during the soft opening. Pours a crystal-clear deep copper with a one-finger, craggy white head. Somewhat subdued nose of light rye, some doughy bread,and a sharp, spiced cracked-grain finish. Amazing taste of rye, toasted cereal, a nice caramel maltiness, and a bountiful, grapefruit hop bitterness. Its been said but bears repeating: this brew has an incredible amount of flavor crammed into such a low-ABV beer. Moderate body; very dry, clean finish. This one is moving to the top of my favorite session beers.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
