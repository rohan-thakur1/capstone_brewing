Must be low-level filtration, because this definitely doesnt taste heavily filtered. Straw-blonde body has golden tints and a large, well-retained, white head.Again, the first thing I get, is Bells house character. Must be the water...since this is obviously not their house ale yeast. Pepper and herbs, with bits of sourdough-like maltiness and white grape abound. American hopping isnt overdone, and actually mimics the noble hops pretty well, if rather much more intensely (nectarine, lemon, orange, light pine). Everything is quite rich and intense, but its fairly well balanced but for a bit of excess pine/sourdough. Clean, for sure.Very malty in the mouth, with strong honey and moderate sourdough-like toastiness. Big pepper and dried herb notes slowly give way to lemon, orange rind, white grape and light pine, but are in turned checked, slightly, by more sticky, moderately sweet malts on the finish. Soft, malty, almost sticky texture with ample, engaging carbonation. Could see this being a bit of a trainwreck fresh, as even after 2+ months, its still VERY assertive and has a bit more pine and sourdough than I want.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Light sweetness accumulates to medium by the end. Moderately soft medium body but perfectly crisp, very approachable, with the sense that the hops mightve been overdone. Very fresh and juicy, lightly sticky lips and late-noticed lace, I could see this combination working very well in a rye beer or porter, and there are some very slight similarities to country rye and spelt saison (save, of course, the mouthfeel).

2700,"2016-08-19",3.1,"Canned on June 9, 2016. Light golden. Puffy collar of nonuniform foam. Decent aroma of lemon, orange pith, resin, spruce, and a hint of pepper and herbs. Soft, but foamy and loose, carbonation. Hops are immediately overshadowed by a forceful surge of stinging alcohol and viscid residual sugars. Hoppiness steers toward nuance-pummeling resin and orange pith, with minimal floral and lemon notes poking through. Negligible pepper and herbaceous notes are mostly absorbed by the ongoing alcoholic glow, although do help to sharpen the mouthfeel. Malt is fairly refined and fluffy and helps negate the alcohol. Body lacks firmness, and theres very little dryness or minerals to cleanse the palate and offset the persistent resin and citrus. The finish is predominated by orange pith, yet contains salvaging haylike malt and a coarse herbal twinge which gives the impression of clean attenuation. While this lacks some of the nuance I look for the in the style, its better than expected from this average brewery. Too bad that its citrusy and resinous. A decoction would help give this some personality, and more lagering time coupled with a boost in minerals to firm up the mouthfeel would be welcome. Dry-hopping a lager is an unnecessary gimmick (especially with high-alpha PNW hops), but so it goes. No flaws or anything, just could use some fine-tuning. Serviceable.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

...Outstanding beer. I see the picture on here shows it in a bottle... what the hell? Is it rare in bottles? Id buy this a shit constantly if I had six-packs. Brewery only, maybe? Who knows. I sure as hell dont. This is a golden lager (imagine that) with solid lacing. Not too shabby. The smell/taste is what really gets me with this one. I think of it as Two Hearted with less bitterness... and maybe somehow someway even bigger floral/Fruity Pebble aromas. Holy damn is it nice. The taste is a bit more mild, but that only makes this even more easy to drink, and I dont have a problem with that.

Always glad to try to a new style and I think Bells hit their mark here, but I wasnt the biggest fan.

Noble hops initially in the nose, slowly revealing some nice fall fruit notes (crisp apple), pale malts, and hints of pepper. Modest pungent notes complement the bone dry finish, light fruit the bridge between them. Grassy as hell, almost like a cross between a really ripe saison and a pre-Prohibition lager. Really fine stuff.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Pours clear pale yellow with a big pillowy head that fades very slowly and leaves chunky, soapy lacing.  Aroma is pine needles, flowers, pilsner malt, spicy hops, and a very light fruitiness.  Taste is an awesome mix of stinging pine needles and crisp pilsner malt.  Finish has an awesome bitter sting to it with some spicy hops and sharp carbonation.

So I got this instead of getting hammered, even if it wasnt cheap. Shitty mainstream beer has completely turned me off of pilsners or lagers but Ive been meaning to try a high rates one recently to see what a good pilsner or lager tastes like. Bells is by far my favorite brewery so what better one to try than this amazing rare beer. It came to me in a 10oz glass. It had a nice creamy thick head and a beautiful gold color. It kind of looks like pop though as its very effervescent and it also goes down like pop. I guess thats not too bad if thats what you like but Im not used to that in beers so it was a little weird. Not bad though. It smells really sweet, a little bitter and citrusy. It tastes very citrusy and sweet with a tiny amount of bitter. This is my absolute favorite pislner/lager Ive ever had in my entire life. If I ever see it again I will most likely get it without any hesitation. Bells never lets you down.","USA","Krej"

Bells is one of those breweries that can do whatever they want however they want and it will always be amazing and this beer is no different. This is hands down the best lager I have ever drank. It Pours a fizzy murky lemonade color, with a thick white head and some lacing. Not much of a nose, a little hops and a lot of citrus and grass. The taste is hoppy too. A citrusy ipa flavor, with a pop-like lager body. If you ever come to a place where you can get a bells one off, do it. I?ll come right out and say it, I HATE lagers and I find this beer amazing.

Sams must be the #1 Bells account in the state because they have been getting lots of one-offs and other Bells kegs that you rarely see outside of the Kalamazoo area.   I was a little worried that this might be an old keg, but was willing to take the chance.  At sams you have to get a full pour, or nothing so I got almost a full pint of this magical lager.  And super magical it is.  I dont think I have ever had a better lager, and ofcourse this only had a few characteristics I would associate with lagers, but I am by no means an expert on the subject-actually quite the novice.  Pours a glowing yellow with light orange tints, a large, succinct and neat two finger white head with a steady sticky white lace throughout.  Nose is fantastic.  This is an strong pale lager/imperial pils.  Almost smells like a funky orval or a super dry Stillwater premium, super doughy, dry hops are in full effect, hardly any sweetness at all, just super fresh, light lemon and grassy tartness.   Flavor is equally amazing.  Super dry, lightly fruity, minerals, light leather and barnyard.  Again, very light sweetness, incredibly crisp and dry.  I had to drink this much quicker than I would have liked because of time constraints, but goddamn, it was amazing.  Clerk said they hoped to get another keg or maybe even some bottles as Bells has plans to brew this again.  I sure hope so.

2700,"2011-09-11",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 2, 2012 Had a glass of this at the end of the SW Mich brew tour about a month ago. I was pretty out of it by the time I ordered this and some Oracle (what the hell was I thinking?) Anyway, what I can recall, this was I guess the best lager ever. It had a pleasant sweetness, a slight tartness, and a wonderful hop presence. In other words, it actually had some character to it. Bells is selling 750s of these now for $17 a pop, which bums me out because Id rather see 6-packs or 4-packs even, and a lower price point. I would suggest just having some at the taproom if youre near Kalamazoo because it is damn tasty. Hopefully once the new brewing facility is up and running maybe they can crank out enough of this to put in 12 oz. bottles.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"

The pale straw color and moderate white head apparently had me hard-wired to expect a wan beer experience, but lo! this was anything but. Unexpectedly piney aroma with traces of cereal. Flavor brought forth more PNW hop character, accompanied by crisp graininess and minerality. Very dry finish.

The head fades quickly to a thin remnant and leaves a small amount of white lace. The nose has satisfying lemony citrus notes along with pine and crystal malts. The flavour is dry throughout with straw and big hops with notes of fruit and citrus, pine and forest. The finish is clean with a lagerish quality. On the palate, it is light in body with a dry texture and soft carbonation.

2700,"2011-08-02",4.5,"This beer was featured at the ""12 Bells of Christmas"" at Chatham Tap in Fishers, IN in early December.  First off, I have to start this off with wow. It pours a BMC like dark straw yellow with no head at all. It look no different than a Bud or Millter Lite. This deception leads to a greater finish. It smells great. It has this Gumballhead mixed with IPA aroma to it. It is very piny, floral, has hoppy bitterness to go with subtle sweetness. The flavor mirrors this. It has the flavor of Gumballhead mixed with an IPA to feature a perfect mix of the two. This is by far the best lager Ive ever had. It drinks very light and smooth. The content is very deceptive. It drinks so light and has exceptional flavor that this beer can creep up on you. It is excellent, absolutely phenomenal. Wow. Its disappointing that this may have been my only time to drink it.

Pours a pale shade of yellow with a bit of haze. Several finger white head and a bit of lacing. Nose consists primarily of a really nice earthy pine scent with a bit of a floral aspect to it as well. Taste isnt quite as heavy on the pine, and adds in a bit of mild bready flavors. Mouthfeel is nice and dry with the spice. Although a bit heavy and unique in the flavor to be too drinkable, this was quite good.
