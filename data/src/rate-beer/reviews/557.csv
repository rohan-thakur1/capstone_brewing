557,"2015-11-12",3.7,"Draft at The Pour House in Westmont, NJ. 

Pours a dark chestnut brown color thats completely opaque with purplish/plum hues and a one finger beige head that slowly settles into a thin ring. Sporadic splotches of lace left behind.

Surprisingly roasty aroma forthe style with a bit of toast, dark chocolate, caramel and coffee bean. This is not overwhelming, however, with subtle earthy hops and a good bit of estery dark fruit notes, notably grape and dark cherry. 

Medium bodied and again, has a bit more roast than expected. The experimental ingredients give complexity to a style that can become boring adding a nice balance to the alcohol sweetness and estery dark fruit flavors. Hints of dark chocolate, toffee, oatmeal and subtle coffee bean flavor followed by alcohol, plum, raisin and dark cherry. Kind of like a roasted dark chocolate covered cherry. Theres also some subtle hop bitterness and well masked ABV making this complex beer very easy to drink. Nice experimental beer from dfh for a change.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

557,"2014-06-20",4.0,"Transfer from BA review from 6-26-12 - 
Served in a 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance  Served a deep brown color with a billowy light tan head. The head had a moderate amount of lacing and gave way to a medium amount of lacing.

Smell  The aroma was quite roasty. Roasted malt with nice hints of espresso and chocolate. A lighter sweetness comes to the nose as well; lightly molasses in nature with good hints of burnt sugar.

Taste  The taste started out much sweeter then I initially expected from the nose. The brew started with a great sweet flavor of brown sugar and molasses complimenting the very roasty malt flavor. The roasted malt becomes more brown bread as the taste advances, with some light notes of carob and chocolate coming to the tongue. At the end the taste some Belgian spicy flavors enter the scene and overall leave a rather roasty and burnt sugar and spice flavor on the tongue.

Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is normal. A thicker body would have been better for the roasty flavor of the brew. The carbonation level is on the just below average side and is very suiting; allowing all the roasty flavors to sit on the tongue and be sensed.

Overall  A very nice darker brew with interesting taste combinations and transitions. Well worth a try if you have the chance.","","Darkmagus82"

I was saving this for some reason, but no longer care. Is a dubbel going to age well? I guess were all about to find out.
Dark fruits, milk chocolate, grains, nutmeg, and cherry. The colour is a deep reddish brown with a very creamy off white head. The taste is roasted malt, cherry, nutmeg, oak, brown sugar and honey and rooibos. This is a good dubbel and looking back through a bunch of other ratings, it appears that this ages well with perhaps the cherry being more prevalent than early on. Im not sure because this just may be my palate.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","dfearnley"

557,"2013-06-15",4.0,"Pours a nice deep red, brown from a distance with some eggshell fizz on the rim. The aroma is great, rich roasted grains, chicory, some Belgian fruits. The flavor is rich and very big. Lots of crazy things going on, sport of a mild Belgian dark porter, with hearty roasted notes, some robust chocolate and dried fruits. At first I could taste the rooibos but it quickly blends nicely into one complete roasted thing. Not much on the Belgian front but the intricacies of it set it apart from American imperial browns and porters and it is totally different that a Belgian mild stout or dubbel. Very good, I would not call it a dubbel, more a blend of an American strong brown ale mixed with a Belgian dark strong ale.","Raytown, Missouri, USA","freeofthoughts"

557,"2013-05-29",4.0,"Appearance:
A beautiful brushed tan head covers liquid depths that speak of worn mahogany and cherry woods.

Nose:
Bark, sage, figs, exotic mushrooms. Raw peppercorns in the back. Western saddles and broken in leather. Essence of farm dust and grazing livestock  massive musk without the poop. Taro root. Dried figs, juniper, and black root. Star anise.

Palate:
Out of nowhere I am left with tart apples that pucker the cheeks and tickle the tastebuds. The Wild West meets old Europe meets the herbalist meets the rainforest in a crazy mélange of flavors that tastes of time itself. Very rustic and musky in the back with endless forests of bark, trees, and fallen foliage. Dry brittle parching bakers chocolate along the edges. Rich spicy earthy peppery Bordeaux and Zinfandel grapes in the middle. A gin-ish essence pervades the palate with star anise while wild mushrooms grow underneath. Caraway seeds. Old red wine soaked leather sacks. A mysterious mixture of green herbs in the middle. Touch of old black earth in the back. Very parching.

Final Thoughts:
A perplexing thought-provoking beer from the folks at Dogfish Head that leaves me still wondering if I liked the beer or I like the experience. Maybe Ill have to find another bottle to decide. Either way, if Mother Nature and Father Time had a baby, its name would be URKontinent.

557,"2013-04-28",4.0,"Bottled 750.  Nose is sweet with plenty of rich roast and underlying chocolate, theres some frozen syrup / candi / molasses for complexity, mild plums, roasted seeds.  A really vibrant earthy/grainy feel!  Even some sweet malted milk balls.  Noisy pour, deepest dark ruby with a frothing tan head.  In the mouth, malted milk toward the front and various roastings pushed way to the back, lots more cherry and red berry, light black currants and mineral strokes.  Faintest of herbal qualities, somewhat indistinct; very low bitterness and medium sweetness.  Medium body yields gentle slow warming and a gorgeous velvety malty feel.  I love reading off the special ingredients used, as theyre among my favorite occasionals in the kitchen; here they go utterly unnoticed in the mouth (though may contribute to some of the roasty aromatics) and prove the gimmick unnecessary -- this is nothing more than a really good dubbel!","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

557,"2013-03-13",3.8,"Aroma is becks dark but toastier, taste is toasted nutty Belgian becks dark with a touch of cherry, and a floral whiff, finishes tootsie roll laced with cherry caramel notes. if you remember Petes wicked ale from early mid nineties, theres some notion of that sans hops.

Edit: I really criticize dogfish head BC or price. Burton baton and 90 are phenomenal. I like the idea for a lot of DF beers, but I like beer more. Their beers are delicious, their ideas are genious, the two dont always meet up. This time they kinda did too well. Wish this wasnt so balanced.can also be described as a session ale you cant session, and an exotically flavored ale with too many overtones of simplicity.

557,"2012-11-03",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
Raspberry fruitiness, chicory-like roast and sugary cereals create a puzzling but pleasant profile for this, yet another strange DFH brew whose sole purpose appears to be strangeness and not the accomplishment of a particular flavor profile, texture, flavor sequence, etc.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the misty brown.
-Carbonation is soft, making the brew feel heavier than it is in this case.
-Earthiness is tasted throughout as well.
-Im getting tired of all these DFH brews with exotic ingredient lists which end up being showcased in a similarly plump, sugary mouthfeel.

The aroma was all about the chocolate with a roasted grain malt and a sweet doughy yeast with a note of dark fruit (cherries and currant), a hint of roasted coffee and a mild nuttiness.

The taste was extremely malty and a tad sweet with a big note of chocolate and a touch of coffee throughout with the finish being quite fruity and having a mild nutty alcohol ending. The flavor stuck around for an average time after the swallow with a bold roasty mocha flavor left to linger on the taste buds.

Mouthfeel was medium in body and creamy in texture with a nice soft carbonation.

this ale had a dark brown pour that is a dark red / ruby when placed in front of a lamp, this beer was opaque but I could see through it a little at the sides of he glass, the pour made an initial one and half finger light tan colored head that receded to a thin cover with a couple of open spaces, this drink left some spots and small fingers of lacing that rolled off the glass a bit, there was no sediment on the bottom of the bottle, 

the aromas were earthy dry chocolate, faint Rootbeer, toasted malt and some roasted malt notes that resembled a brown ale, dark roasted grains, faint toasted bread, prune and date dark fruit, malt, molasses and brown sugar sweetness, petite floral notes, a little muted herb and spice that I could not place except there appeared to be just a little green cardamom in the mix, licorice in the background to, 

it had flavors of toasted and roasted malt, a little chocolate, caramel, prune and date fruit, alcohol esters, 
some earthy malt like flavor, the finish had some drying on the tongue but there still was some malt and sweetness skimming by, there was a little pepper, 

the mouth feel was a little less than medium with a nice creamy feel on the palate, and average carbonation, 

the first sniff reminded me of an Imperial Stout, big malt nose with a little chocolate and other things, the nose was nice but it did not come across as a Belgian Dubbel, I did not smell the alcohol but it was noticeable on the tongue when tasted, it was not hot or flashy alcohol but I knew it was there, and this did not take away from the enjoyment of this drink, but I was surprised to notice 8% alc. in a beer, this beer was nice but I do not know if I would buy this again.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

A - Pours a dark brown body. Lets some light through with a red tinge. One finger light tan head. Settles into a small cap with thick edging. Solid lacing and retention.

S - Im not familiar with ANY of these ingredients. So I guess the notes Im picking up are somewhat novice and pedestrian...large roasty notes. Im picking up hazelnut, bittersweet chocolate, sweetened coffee, caramel, and some dark fruits. Earthy and grainy finish. 

T - Same as the nose. Roasty with hazelnut, bread, dark fruits, coffee, caramel, and an earthy and slightly bitter finish. Taste is somewhat dubbel like, but with a really peculiar twist. Each ingredient is faint and subtle, but there is a lot of ingredients vying for attention and it doesnt meld together very gracefully. Alcohol becomes present as it warms up. The weakest link is the mouth feel, somewhat thin and lacking in body. Carbonation also seems a bit low.

Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is a touch dry and sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

Flavor has a nice mix of malt, fruit, cloves, cinnamon and yeast. Smooth texture has firm body, if not a whole lot of fizz. From the name I get the impression that this is the successor to Pangaea.

557,"2012-07-14",4.1,"What to say about this? This is an all around good beer with a lot of things going on. Not too heavy or light, but all the different ingredients seem to get muddled up and make them hard to identify. A decent beer, but quite pricey.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
557,"2012-07-14",4.1,"750 ml bottle. Pours dark brown but looks ruby red in the light; has a large beige head that collapses into a blanket of foam after a few minutes. Aroma is malt-driven--smells like chocolate-covered cherries; I smell sweetness, it might be the honey; floral notes are prominent. Taste is sweet and meaty, delicious. Honey and floral flavors are strong, and again, that chocolate covered cordial cherry flavor. This is a well-crafted delicious brew. From the aroma, I thought it might be cloyingly sweet and not to my liking, but Im glad I was wrong.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"

Taste is sweet, dominated by toasted caramel and chocolate malts.  A boozy flavor of cherry is also noticeable, with just a hint of grassiness on the end.  Mouthfeel is watery, with a prickle of light carbonation.  In sum, a beer that is faithful to the style, but I am unable to taste or recognize most of the ""special"" ingredients.  Not quite as eclectic tasting as many of DFHs ""experimental"" beers, but worth a try if you like dubbel ales.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","elektrikjester"

The body is extremely drinkable, maybe a little drinkable given the alcohol content.  Speaking of which, the alcohol is minimally noticeable, making this both an easily drinkable and extremely dangerous beer!  The flavors are really intense, with more notes of coffee, chocolate, a hint of cream, rustic and earthy malts and light bread.

But there just wasnt any wow factor in the actual way it drank.

A ton going on here!  Dark chocolate, roasted malts, toasted brown sugar, caramel , cherry and earthy notes are there as well. The smell is fantastic!

Taste follows the nose fairly closely.  Moderate fruity esters. Starts with plenty of tart cherry and roasted chocolate, with notes of coffee, dates, bananas, and hints of bourbon. The roasted malt is quite pleasant, giving this a toasty, creamy flavor. A pleasant sweetness from either honey or malts. Finishes with the slightest bit of tang.  Very complex. Im not familiar with many of the exotic ingredients so it is difficult to comment on their roles in the flavor profile. All I know is the result ends up being balanced and delicious.

Full bodied, medium carbonation, lush. Alcohol is well hidden behind sweetness. Very drinkable considering the style.

Wow! I am a big fan of Belgians and Im pretty unforgiving of bad interpretations of the style. URKontinent is pushing the envelope with the use of its exotic ingredients but ends up with a bulls-eye for the style.","South Euclid, Ohio, USA","DoublEE"

557,"2012-05-26",3.6,"Poured into a snifter.

3.0 A: Black color. Three fingers of tan frothy/creamy head. Retention is a bit below average and no lacing is left.

4.5 S: This has a great nose. Through and through this is a solid dubbel first. Lots of caramel, dark fruits, and light peppery spiciness. Fruits include plum, date, raisin, currants, and tobacco. The honey is mild, but there. After that, theres some stuff that I cant really indentify (since I dont know what half the ingredients taste like), but it all works seemlessly into the brew. I can identify the rooibos, which in more complementary than I ever would have expected. 

4.0 T: In the taste, the adjuncts hold a much larger presence. While the result is very tasty, the dubbel gets pushed aside, which is sad since it smells quite nice. Anyway, lots of caramel again with all the fruits mentioned in the smell. Rooibos does great things again (Im going to have to brew with this sometime) while the collective other ingredients give an herbal, somewhat nutty, earthiness. Mild pepper again from the yeast. Definitely unique, which DFH does so well, but also extremely well integrated. Im impressed.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. This doesnt have the archaetypical Belgian mouthfeel. The carbonation isnt much spritzy at all. Rather, its more of a mellow carbonation that doesnt poke or prod the tongue. Its like the tea is controlling this. Still, decent enough.

4.0 D: Tasty beer, but at $12 a pop, its hard to justify another purchase. This is a once a year type beer for me. I highly recommend giving it a go though.

557,"2012-05-26",4.3,"Pours a dark brown with a hint of ruby along the edges... Rich aromas of malts, chocolate, earthy notes and a touch of sweet Belgian sugar. This beer is damn good... definitely rides the Dubbel style with rich sweet malts but the different flavor attributes from the numerous ingredients really make this a complex beer.  Great chocolate, plum, black tea flavors and the mouthfeel on this one is perfect.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
557,"2012-05-25",3.9,"I really liked this aggressive, supercharged belgianesque dubbel.  Like a brown ale, it has the chocolate and the toasty malt - and like a dubbel, it has red fruit and a generous mouthfeel.  Really good.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","jefcon"

557,"2012-05-24",4.6,"Poured into a chalice from a 750ml bottle from 2012.

A: Almost opaque chestnut body with a dense tan head, this beer looks excellent in this glass.

S: The aroma is very complex and inviting. Right away I pick up cocoa and a mild roasted hazelnut coffee aroma that come through the strongest. A very mild cherry comes through with some honey and earthy notes, but overall the Wattleseed takes over the flavor, and Im okay with that because this smells amazing.

T: Wow this is just as good in flavor as it smells. The roasted hazelnut coffee hits first with hints of cocoa, while the honey provides some mid-taste sweetness, and the Belgian yeast finishes the beer with a warming slightly spiciness to it and some cherry flavored medicinal esters. This is phenomenal.

M: Medium to thick with light carbonation, drinks very smooth.

O: This is simply amazing, this beer is very complex and super easy to drink. Its also one of the few ""weird"" Dogfish Head beers I would buy again and again. Dogfish Head knocked it out of the park with this one.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Nose is great; a big nutty, cacaoey, with earthy esters, black cherry, hops, honey.  Tastes rich, complex, with notes of earthy malt, big hazelnut, cacao, coffee, black cherry, and a complex finish.  This one finishes even more complex than it starts, and the ingredients meld together amazingly well.

Taste is very interesting, unlike anything Ive had before.  Lots of seed flavors with some honey and other grain flavors.  Very interesting, and I can tell there are a lot of weird ingredients.  Some floral qualities as well.  Alcohol is slightly noticeable.  The finish is very nice with some good roasted flavors and some floral dry notes.

557,"2012-05-18",4.1,"750 ml bottle.  Served in an Orval chalice, the beer pours a ruby red/brownish color with a half inch tan head that stays around a little while.  Theres also a good amount of lacing.  Aroma is nice and malty, it smells like nuts, chocolate, honey, caramel, and an earthy/herbal aroma that Im not exactly sure what it is.  The brew tastes like nuts, dark fruit, milk and bittersweet chocolate, honey, roasted malt and and earthy/floral/tea like taste that I think is from the rooibos.  Theres a good balance between the sweet and bitter flavors.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit slick and creamy with a good amount of carbonation.

557,"2012-05-11",4.1,"Bottle poured and drank from a snifter.  At first pour this is very different than any beer Ive had.  It had a this head that was very light, and I could audibly hear it fizzing like I had just poured a soda.  However, the head dissipated quickly.  The color is dark and carmely, much like a cola.  I can smell hints of chocolate and a bit of honey in the nose of the beer.  This beer tastes chololatey like a stout, with a sweet and clean finish.  The mouth feel is very light despite the dark color of the beer.  Overall this is a very good beer that I would recommend to my friends.  Another fine example of why I love the adventurous approach to beer that Dogfish Head takes.","","JoshS60R"
