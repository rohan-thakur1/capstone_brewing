Pours a clear amber-orange color with a bubbly, medium head, which turns out to be unusual stable.

Smells of a profound funkiness, entangled into dried apple peel and dusty, old oak. Has a mineralic stony quality with wet mushrooms and a flowery grassiness to it. White bread and sour lemon pulp compliment both to the pungent funk in this, establishing an awesome, aromaful nose, which is hard to compare to any of the other Lambic.

Has a lively but fitting carbonation and an utmost refreshing light body, revealing tons of flavor nuances. This creates an ever developing taste, which focusses throughout on its taste defining sourness.

Tastes of moldy earth, old apple peel, wet stones and a juicy lemony whiff. The lemon turns more flavorful after this initial stage, opening up the palate to a well dosed sourness, defining the flavors without getting close to numbing the tongue. Apple gets a tad sweeter during the finish with an aqueous softness, wrapped up by crisp lemon peel. 

Drinks very nice, full of fruit supported funk with a bright, soft finish, soothing the sourness without loosing any character. Moldy, matured white wine characteristics get combined with crisp lemon and create an inciting potential.","GERMANY","aleigator"

362,"2014-09-03",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2015 Old geuze blended from Boon, Lindemans and Girardin lambics. Orange blonde colour with fierce, champenoise sparkling and dense, frothy head, very powerful and attacking aroma, funky, complex as any old geuze, with lots of citric acidity, barnyard, old cheese, almost agressive estery fruitiness and woody sherry notes. Taste equally complex and fruity, strikingly acid (a true neige geuze) - in fact, I found this to be among the most sour of all geuzes I tasted so far.

It was tough to choose a starting point with so many fine lambics on display. Eventually I went with a brewery that I wanted to know more about - De Cam. This was a great choice as it turned out to be nearly as exceptional as the Cantillon. If someone offered this to me it would be hard to turn down.

Aroma / Appearance - The bronze carbonated body was accompanied by a stiff white head. Vinegar, blue cheese, and sweaty gym socks that have fermented in a locker are the things you imagine from a world class gueuze. The dryness reminds me of a top notch brut.

Flavor / Palate - The tartness in the acetic profile stings the tongue. Like drinking the rinse water from sweaty gym clothes it has a nice funk. The lemony polish of the transition carries into a blue cheese finish. Beers like this are the reason that I wanted to come to Belgium in the first place. No wonder they are nearly impossible to find in the US.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

362,"2012-10-12",4.4,"375ml corked and caged bottle from Jan 2009.

Okay, I put it in the fridge for about an hour and when I removed the cage, the cork shot out like a rocket. Thankfully, I didnt lose much of the beer.

It pours a huge head of foam..I can see a cloudy straw yellow brew underneath. As the foam shrinks, it leaves some nice lacing behind.

The smell is both very sour and a bit bitter. Lots of apple like tartness dominate but theres also a barnyard kind of smell there. It smells so good. I wonder if the taste can match it.

Green apple tartness is up front, slight hint of funk, a bit of hop bitterness, more sourness...this is a grand brew to drink if you really dig sours. Im smacking my mouth drinking this. I just dont want the sourness of this brew to leave my palate!

362,"2012-09-13",4.1,"Bottle shared by drabmuh. Thanks Matt! We drank this in the backyard while the women folk had a baby shower inside the premises.

My pour looks great, much to the surprise of the other gents, who had a quite different experience. Golden hued, with a finger of off white head that stuck around for a few minutes, before leaving some sparse lacing on the glass. The aroma offers wonderful barnyard funk, hay, light citrus, and oak. Great flavor, bringing everything I found in the aroma together quite nicely. The body is fairly thin, with low carbonation. Overall, a very tasty beer. I seem to have enjoyed this quite a bit more than my counterparts. I would definitely have this again.

Pours a clear golden color with very head and zero lacing. A good swirl or two brings nothing back up, and subsequent hard pours didnt fare much better. The nose brought plenty of earthy barnyard and funk with some oak in the background. The flavor layered the funk quite well. Nice hay and earth and a dry finish that was quite smooth.

Cork comes out without even a puff; the beer pours a gently cloudy gold, flat and with essentially no head. Robust musty, funky, latrine-and-barnyard aroma. I like the previous raters description of swamp mud. Tidal swamp mud! (Hence the rotting crab flesh and mangrove roots).  Some yellow apple, a little bit of vinegar when this is cold; funk taking over as it warms. Yeah, all that, and its magnificently so.Leomo 

Nice gently sour flavor, nothing strong or abrupt, the restrained acidity allowing the more complex and interesting components of the flavor (basically, those that drive the aroma) to come through in force. Lemon juice, a light chardonnay butteriness, sourdough. Light woodness dryness on the close, all in balance, quite refined. I could use a bit more carbonation in the mouthfeel - this is totally flat - but thats a relatively minor complaint given how well this beer works for me.

A steady pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a two finger thick, pale tan colored head. The beer is a honey amber color that shows a mostly clear, bright pale amber, gold tinged hue when held up to the light. The aroma is very vibrantly fruity and tart with an earthy undercurrent. Fresh pressed macintosh apples, table grapes, and some green, slightly tropical like fruit are backed by a softly smelling acidity, and a solid, musty, musky, rotting fruit like, saw-dust mushrooms, as well as some earthy, dried hay like, slightly toasted pale malt and grain notes. At times this smells a bit like sour apple jolly ranchers.

This has a prickly carbonation, a lightly biting tartness and an astringency to this up front, and is backed by a oxidation influenced malt character that is a touch nutty, definitely a bit like dried hay, or dried wildflowers, and perhaps a hint of sherry like notes. The body of this beer is fairly light, even for a Gueuze, I wouldnt call it watery though, as there is a touch of lactic slickness to this beer. The acidity here is dominantly lactic in character, this accentuates a grapefruit like flavor up front, but then accentuates a oxidation influenced cider like fruitiness towards the finish. Touches of toasted, nutty oak notes come out in the long finish where they linger lightly on the palate. This is light on funkiness, the Brettanomyces and more wild fermentation notes play a more subtle role in this Gueuze than I usually prefer; light mushroom notes, slightly musky, musty, with a soft phenolic influence.

Definitely not on the same level of the Tilquin or Girardin that I had the previous two nights; this lacks the richness, the deep complexity, and even the body of the previous two brews; to be honest I have not had a great vintage of this since I first sampled this from the source in 2001. The apparent oxidation is likely the major flaw to this brew, though even that is not unenjoyable. It is still not too shabby, and something I am quite happy to be quaffing, but I wont go out of my way to pick up more bottles of this vintage, but I am not ready to stop trying various vintages of this brew.

  The carbonation on this beer is pathetic for a Gueuze, pretty much non-existent, after a careful pour there is neither a hint of a head or even a foretelling of a carbonation bubble.  The beer is a clear, honey-amber color.   The aroma is a dream though; funky sour, well integrated, overall it just pulls me back to Belgium sipping Lambic in the local cafes.  Aromatic touches of grapefruit, lactic acid, hints of urea, mellow butyric acid like barnyard funk, piquant lemon, lavender, a bit of aromatic soap, dusty wheat, .  Sharp acidity, piquantly spicy, just funky enough, this aroma really is just a fantastic treat; it is missing the lively, peppery, carbonic acid notes, but this is such a trip, I just cant get enough.

A puckering sour note at first, but then it yields a soft touch to the tartness that was not in this beer that last time I had it.  Certainly not quite as hard as when I last had this beer in 2001, still the acidity is omnipresent and quite appetizing.  Just about completely flat, though there is a minuscule amount of CO2 here that just barely adds something to the body.  Speaking of which, this beer is nice and light, though it has a hint of a viscous texture to it that makes it a bit thicker than water.  Nicely lactic in its sourness, but it has a hint of citrus to it as well as perhaps a memory of acetic acid.  A touch of musty, stale cat notes add a soft funkiness to the brew.  A touch of barrel character subtly adds notes of vanillin and a certain tannic backbone that affects both the flavor, body and mouthfeel of this brew.

This is a really nice version of a Lambic, of course I was expecting a Gueuze when I popped the cork.  I certainly do miss the lively carbonation and accompanying bottle conditioned funk that a grand Gueuze has, but this is a really good beer.  The base Lambic is just so good that I almost dont miss the characteristics of a fantastic (and this would have been one) bottle conditioned, traditional Gueuze; though in all truthfulness a part of me really does miss it.
Sampled at the source 2001A sour lemony aroma with only a hint of mustiness to it.  There is a definite sharp acidity to it, that I would say is on the hard side for the traditional geuze blenders.  The carbonation is lively and seems to enhance the acidity.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

362,"2007-12-11",3.9,"375mL bottle, courtesy of ygtbsm94.  Thanks, Brad!  Pours a vibrant, hazy yellowish-brown color; thick, bright white head with excellent structure, retention, and lacing that clings.  I could smell this from the moment the cork popped: dense, funky and musty geuze characteristics: horseblanket, citrus, and plenty of sour.  Plenty of acidity and jaw-clenching citric sourness upfront; earthy, musty, with sour lemons and barnyard funk at the forefront; nothing exceptional stands out in the fruit character: mostly lemons and sourness coupled with light carbonation and plenty of potent acidity; well-composed and a perfectly well-made geuze; it just got a little boring by the middle of the bottle and I kept hoping for a little bit more; a slight metallic note appears mid-palate; nothing bad, but its certainly there where a fruit or yeasty character should perhaps be taking its place.  An excellent standard geuze, really.  Medium finish, showing citrus and that slight metallic edge again, with the sourness dropping off quite quickly; a little too lifeless at the very end.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
362,"2007-12-01",4.1,"A steady pour reveals a near motionless body that reluctantly lets forth a small amount of miniscule carbonation, forming a wispy white trace-foam. The body eminent is a deep apple-juice and amber blend, similar to oak-aged ice cider. The nose is focused, sturdy and funked out. What is happening in the nose is contrarian; two differing opinions meeting again after trekking full circle along the edge of the aromatic spectrum within the style. Everything seems full bore but regulated, moderated by some force unseen. Barnyard funk is interlaced with must, grass and fresh acid apples. Yeast is prevalent throughout. Must grows in the flavor, as all ingredients find a stability at at high-pitched meeting point that resembles a funky variance of balance and composure. This is quite interesting and very good, as well as easy to drink. Refreshing acidity and milder acetity coexist harmoniously with leather and earthy leanings. Sourness and tartness are medium high, both in the (interpreted)aroma and flavor. The finish is lightly bitter, highly sour and substantially drying. Fruit, especially apple and tropical varieties, dust the nose and flavor and grind away in the finish. The mouthfeel is sparsely carbonated to the point of near lifelessness but this has plenty of character and enough refreshing acids and tartness to seem as lively as a lambic this full-bodied could be. Id imagine this would often be interpreted as a suitable introductory blend, as it lacks any notable tangents where harsh sourness or anything else veers over the top. Still, this could be classed among the greats for its power and commendable scope. Delicious.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Low end carbonation pushes the acidity to good levels but without getting too astringent or ""burning"", the funky flavor tastes a bit more corky than woody, it again reminded me of a dry cider, especially in the finish, its drying and tart but oh-so easy to drink and makes you drink more and more!

In long: Nose is funky and sharp like most good gueuzes except that this one has a bit more of an apple/cider aroma.  Taste has grainy malts with flavors of young sour apples, apple seeds and small branches.  An overall sandy sensation.  Strong acidity, strong dryness, medium sourness.

362,"2006-09-14",4.0,"As my lambic week-end came to a close, I decided I ought to give De Cams geuze a try for the sake of being thorough (not to mention my love of the style). Up until then, my knowledge of the spontaneously-fermented covered a healthy range but one involving above all the primary protagonists, which sadly seem to be swamping what used to be a rich and diverse tradition. Nonetheless one can only respect the few remaining brewers untainted by the sweet smell of money, and De Cam is surely one of them. Served in the classic tumbler (though not my glassware of choice), this geuze appeared golden and clear, not exceptionally attractive in color but topped of a resplendent alpine head - dense, spongy and coalescing to a husky hoop. To the nose, sweet dried fruits composed a mingling array introduced by raisin and banana, followed by the juicier pear and apple aroma. A noticeable blend of mild cheddar and gouda produced the necessary funk profile, to which the acrimonious scent of rubber added an unpleasant tonality. Proceeding to the tongue, one notices all the basic elements of geuze notably a dry sourness, hints of apple and rubber again, but generally a lack of originality and direction. While some blenders emphasize the sour, others the fruit, and others yet the barnyard scents, I found that De Cam took a very primordial approach which I suppose allows a certain accessibility but seems merely the sketch of a great geuze. The finishing cheesy note and lightly nutty aftertaste does redeem this nevertheless excellent example, but it is clearly not one of the phenomenal.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

362,"2006-09-04",4.6,"Could be the perfect blend as if I spoke of Whisky or coffee to their particular connoisseurs. Indeed it had depth, life and character but it also weighed up finely as a decent quaffer and summer refresher. Either way this an exciting and incomparably complete Gueuze that just oozed of artisanal craftsmanship, and yet from such a young brewer. Tasted from the bottle into two of its own glasses as it erupted once the cork was popped (waiter was apologetic, though I had to thank him for this one), at the t Brugs Beertje, Brugges, Belgium, one of the finest little pubs in the world. Bright, summery gold in body. With the first surge of pent up gas came a rocky, snow-white head of foam, yet it was visibly very fine in carbonation, even intermittent. Head held on solid, drabbing the glass in its wake. Aroma is potent yet delicate, refined, funky, unique. Its hairy, reeking of sweaty animal fur with so much pepper it tickles the nostrils. Underneath are fruits, exotic fruits, like guava and paw-paw with some raw acidity aided by notes of lime and lemons. Subtle showings of stripped pine, stinging nettles and a little paprika add to my furor, all the more invoking in its wee nuances. In the mouth its dances across the palate. Its dry, rough and potent like the aroma. Hairy, brisk, acidic and very light in mouthfeel. Carbonation keeps it lively but it could be still and equally absorbing. Cracked pepper gets the saliva flowing to start off, then it is all Lambic Gueuze. Classic. Tart, under-ripe fruit stream the tongue with amazing control. This is very fruity. Its heavily acidic, dry yet very fresh. Musty, dank cellar notes develop as it infuses the fruit tones with some lambic funk. Hessian sack notes in back are prominent and reminiscent of cold wet days on a cattle farm as if tasting that waft. Swallow is gently astringent, not too much pucker there, with a rough, hairy aftertaste that has just a little fruit lingering along with raw wood and some forest floor grit. It grips well in the mouth and it lingers for so long. My palate zinged and tickled for an hour afterwards. I loved this. Could have been quite content with a few more bottles of this and a seat in the sun to laze away the afternoon. But, hey, many more beers to taste. <!-- br --> The tip-top, top-of-the-pops Gueuze.

Tiny bubbles visible.  Racing is shallow and quick like a scared child running to the surface.  Smell is heavy with brett and spiderweb sourness, lightened by a vague flowery quality that is a nice accent.  Crisp acidity in the mouth, great brett yeast character in the flavor.  Right after the swallow, Granny Smith apples dominate, and 5 seconds later, the finish dries into a dark spiderweb of yeasty goodness that picks up a spicy black pepper note.  On the very end, sour reemerges on the sides of the tongue, and the spicy/yeasty notes become musty and almost smoky, like vaporized bleu cheese.

362,"2006-04-09",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2007 375mL bottle, bottled in 2001 acquired from my faithful Danish trading partner, Jacob.  Thanks!Shared with OldGrowth on 4/6/06.  Toms the best lambic-drinking partner I could ever ask for.  I pour him the lambic, he takes a sip or two, and gives me the rest of his glass!!!Perfect marks for appearance thanks to the lightly hazy, unfiltered body of a banana-to-brassy-maize yellow and a large, rocky, well-retained, white head that lasts the entirety of the glass and produces huge amounts of lace.  Tiny bubbles rise up sporadically.Nose is full of aggressive lactobacillus.  Hard, grapefruit rind-like and warm, near spoiled yogurt notes briskly rise up from the glass, wasting no time in stating that this is a serious lambic.  Very light sulfur notes, dry, hard plastic-like phenols and moderate tannins all crowd in to give a very decadent and initially, overwhelming effect.  But the beer breathes with the best of wines (and lambics) and fully opens up, while softening (sort of) over the course of the glass.  Dry, cracked, hard leather emerges, as grapefruit and light yogurt notes last.  Light wheat dryness, very marginal oakiness and some old yeast dull things quite appropriately, helping to mitigate the sourness.  Not as much brett as 3F and not as much pediococcus and wood as Cantillon, but the heavy lactobacillus carves its own niche in the lambic world.  Good for de Cam!Flavor is what one would expect from the aroma.  Hard, citrus rind flavors immediately strip the palate, while nectarines and lime-like notes emerge, livening up things and adding some depth to the sourness.  Something lightly sweet is apparent, not sure how it is produced, but almost a soft, cherry-like fruitiness that others have noted, perhaps from B.lambicus.  The body has held up marvelously since 2001 and seems very similar to Cuvee des Champions from the same year.  A bit of aerated space in it, and even some light wateriness on end, but it adds to the drinkability, at least in my mind.  Low carbonation, but enough to get the job done, so to speak, carrying the wild and sour flavors all over the palate.  Not as ""funky"" in the horse manure, barnyard category, but every bit as wild and yeasty.  Though I suppose you could call the light sulphur and moist earthiness barnyard.  Cheers to de Cam.

362,"2005-04-17",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2006 Bottled.  Bottledatum 15/03/03.  A hazy bright orange coloured lambic with an initial white head.  The aroma is fizzy funky with cheesy farmyard notes, tart acidic apples and is very salivating.  The taste is lip-smackingly quenching.  A melange of fruits: peaches, oranges and apples, mixed with a funky sourness, but this is not challengingly over complex.  Instead it is pleasantly drinkable and an art of brewing. (9.3.8.3.15) (3.8)   Bottled - Kulminator - Antwerpen.  (1998 vintage).  A slightly hazy copper coloured beer with a whitish good sized heaad.  The aroma is just sensational:  Fantasically acidic with intense sourness and loads of funk and lemons.  The taste is also full of wow factor.  Beautiful acidity.  Lots of funk, lots of lemon.  Very sharp but in no way harsh. So wonderfully drinkable.  You could drink this all night, although your insides would not appreciate it.

362,"2004-10-02",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2005 Bottle. OK then, surprise me with a beer that is matchless, a beer that is like nothing on earth! I told the bartender at Stockholms finest beer bar Akkurat. He pondered for a few seconds and asked back Have you tried an unsweetened Lambic? We got a lot from de Cam Gooik that matured just enough! 

So I got a bottle lying in a plait basket. The label said (in Flemish only) that it was bottled on the 15th of Mars 2003 and that the ABV was 6.5%. There was also a note about ""1, 2 and 3 years"", but I didnt really grasp that one.

The colour is deep golden yellow and somewhat cloudy, the small foam is built by small bubbles. 

The smell is sweet sour with stains of dried herbs, cherry stone, smoked meat and bacon. 

The carbonation is almost extremely strong with lots of small bubbles.

The complex taste is dominated by a strong sour flavour of gooseberries, iodine, soil, and sour cherries. There is a mild bitterness in the palette, but it is not the type of bitterness you get from hops, more like the taste of lime or ascorbic acid. The aftertaste got a chemical feel and flavours of wood, gooseberries and a touch of salt. 

The man in the bar was right: I have never drunk anything that was even close to this stuff. Did I enjoy it? Yes, however more like an oddity than something that would beat a good English bitter or ESB.","Linköping, SWEDEN","bark"
362,"2004-10-02",4.0,"Poured by the brewer of 3 Fonteinen at the Brussels Beer Weekend (not that that made it taste any better): Musty stale nose with drainpipe that dissappated after a while. Deep hazy gold with a low head - almost no head. Sweet apple malt but balanced well with sour. Not so sour but enough. Atringent for sure and full bodied. Puckering end. Appreciate the balance. Funny story: JorisP presented us with a few bottles of rare geuze as I was drinking this. When I asked if it was better than what I was drinking he said: ""I dont know what you are drinking, but this is better."" Nonetheless, the De Cam is one of my favorite geuzes.","GERMANY","pivo"

The aroma is quite funky with a nice cheesy element, a bit of barnyard hay, white grapes, dry apple cider, strong brett character and a bit of light citrus fruit.  The body is quite full and the carbonation is playful on the tongue.  The flavor is even more funky.  Cheesy as all get out with only a light fruit element laying underneath and a nice iron bit.  Tasty, funky, tart, dry and downright enjoyable.  Maybe not the best Geuze Ive ever had, but it still certainly hit the spot.  An excellent Geuze.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
