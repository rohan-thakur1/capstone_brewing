2540,"2013-05-10",2.9,"Bottle, from trade with the soon to be retired Papsoe. A more or less clear one, golden in color, and topped by a small, off-white head. Mostly citrusy aroma with some grass and pale malts. Biscuit notes. Its rather thin on the palate, but perfectly ok for a beer at 2.6% ABV, with soft carbonation. Some bitterness in the flavor, with orange peel, pine cones and a faint malty touch.

Aroma is american hops with citrus notes and a hint of something that resembles camomile. The aroma is not as intense as for example the Havgus but a bit more fruity. Surprisingly flavourful initially according to the aroma although it quickly fades with the thin body leaving not much a bitter finish. Oily texture, medium carbonation, light body and a short, mildly bitter finish. Pleasant and extremely sessionable.","DENMARK","humlelala"
