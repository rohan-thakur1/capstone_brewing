641,"2016-06-02",3.6,"Dec. 15. A 0.33 l bottle, kindly shared by Marko, thanks a lot! It poured almost completely black body with medium sized head. Coffee aroma and light note of dark fruits. Pleasant and intense, although pretty simple. Lightly bitter roasted flavor (coffee and rye bread) was balanced with more elegant cocoa, chocolate and licorice note. I didnt get any milky notes, probably it only smoothed it on palate. Which is really oily smooth. Medium to full in body with long cocoa, chocolate and coffee finish. Really fine, although chocolate was quite weak as these special choco-stouts can be.","Split, CROATIA","heavy"
