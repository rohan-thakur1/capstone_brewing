2275,"2016-08-25",4.1,"7oz bottle, wrapped in tissue paper. Super oaky, chocolate, strong Apple brandy. Super smooth but very under carbonated. Lots of flavor but no heat.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
2275,"2016-03-29",4.9,"Finally opened one of the two bottles I picked up at the brewery months ago. Drank straight from the bottle. Absolutely delicious.","New Hampshire, USA","twj2000"
2275,"2016-02-09",3.5,"Tiny bottle from the brewery, which Ive been saving for a winters night for about 9 months. The nose is all brandy barrel, which just hits you as soon as you get anywhere near it. The taste is more complex, with the barrel dropping back and mixing in with a lot of raisin and dark fruit flavor, some caramel, and a medium-high amount of oxidization. It reminded me a bit of some of the really aged barleywines, but with a lot of brandy aroma. It probably would have been better 6 months ago, but this is still a really special bottle to get the chance to pop. Well done, Smuttynose, for taking barrel aging to this kind of extreme!","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
2275,"2016-01-01",4.7,"Small bottle from the brewery store. Shared with the wife. Pours a thick looking dark brown with no head. Sweet aromas of rich chocolate, caramel, dates and apple. Equally sweet flavor, featuring all of the above with a hint of soy, just to keep the sweetness in check. Crazy delicious! Pricey, but worth it.","Wilton, New Hampshire, USA","mcox90"
2275,"2015-12-26",4.5,"Awesome! Brown pour, no real head. Sweet and decadent, Apple flavors are light but there, toffee, vanilla, warm booze, oak. Really. Fun beer.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
2275,"2015-12-26",3.9,"Mini bottle... pours a deep amber copper color with a trace of eggsell bubbles. All about the caramel, soft layered toffee, burnt sugar complexity throughout with nuances of baked apple, fruit forward booze, spicy wood and a touch of composted earth and twig tea lingers in the palate. Interesting and better than expected.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
2275,"2015-11-28",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2015 Small bottle from AirForceHops, shared 11/28/15.Rapidly fizzling beige bubbles leave behind a clear, chestnut-auburn body with light mahogany tints.Coming on the tails of Prairie Apple Brandy Vanilla Noir, you can really see the effect the extra time in the barrel had.  Not that the nose is that much more powerful or barrel-influenced, its just much cleaner and more mellow.  As well, the quad characteristics, while not exactly bursting forth are certainly enjoyable, adding tons of various fruit notes (banana, fig, grape, raisin) and a bit of earthiness, as well.  No alcohol, very nicely rounded and balanced, complex nose.The flavor is very much like what I want a barrel-aged strong ale to be; very little warming, a rich, yet not overly sweet flavor and no sharp, acidic or tannic character (or very little of it, anyways).  Fig paste, raisin, caramel, dry toffee, bananas soaked in vanilla-infused brandy.  Low but ample carbonation and a chewy, supple texture.  No heat.  Delicious.  Very surprised the barrel character wasnt overdone, given the six years it spent.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2275,"2015-11-28",4.1,"Poured from bottle thanks Airforcehops dark brown with no head and long lacing. Aromas of caramel apple brandy and brown sugar. Taste is complex oily mouth feel candy sugar caramel and dark fruit. Quite the brew. Kudos!","Middleton, Massachusetts, USA","Chalumeaux"
2275,"2015-11-28",3.9,"Very small bottle thanks to AFH for sharing. This is so tiny. 

A - Poured carefully and it looks very thick. no head of course. 

S - That smell. So dense, thick, burnt sugar, caramelized sugar, malty with liquor boozy vanilla and fig and twizzlers.

T - There is a definite tobacco taste here with candy sugar, caramel and toffee and a ton of dark fruit. theres even this baked apple taste as well. Is this beer?

M - Very oily, very sweet, boozy with this sticky candy finish

O - Very interesting. Pushing the envelope on hyper aged beers and its really interesting that an NH brewery did this. I appreciate their efforts. Six years may be too long but its insanely awesome they did this.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
2275,"2015-11-28",4.2,"Thank you, AirForceHops! Such a special bottle for him to share with us on HIS birthday! Oily dark brown pour with no head. Im smelling the apple brandy. Lots of booze notes. Oily mouthfeel. Hot damn, this flavor is amazing. So much apple in the brandy and so much apple brandy in the beer. Booze is hot at the end. But not too overpowering and not more than I can handle. Delicious.","New Hampshire, USA","Heather_B"
2275,"2015-10-16",4.2,"Bottle thanks to WillRunForBeer. From notes two weeks ago. Aroma is ultra-rich and pretty amazing. Loads of apple brandy with caramel, brown sugar, dark fruit, oak, and light chocolate. Tastes intense. The apple brandy is strong but doesnt make it boozy at all. Very smooth. No carbonation. Ultra rich with a strong sweetness but not cloying. Great stuff. Thanks Brian.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
2275,"2015-10-04",4.0,"bottle, from brewery. great aroma, sweet, dried fruit, apricot, apple, wood. dark orangey brown color, no head or lace.

2275,"2015-08-07",3.9,"Tiny paper wrapped bottle from the brewery store shared tonight with Todd. 
Dark brown liquid with a minimal off white head that dissipates quickly. Big fruity wine and port like aromas with bits of caramelized sugars and hints of soy. Sweet sugary fruity flavors with hints of alcohol. Big chewy syrupy mouthfeel with minimal carbonation. An incredible sipper, I just wish I tried this in front of a fire on a cold winters night.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
2275,"2015-05-31",4.1,"Draft at the brewery. Color is very murkey color brown without a lot of head. The aroma and flavor run hand-in-hand. Rich in barrel, mainly because it was aged six years in apple brandy barrels! (Yes that was told to us from an employee). The flavor has the rich quad base (figs, dates, raisins and caramel) with ice cider hints from the rich apple.brandy. I cant even describe the smoothness of the texture and mouth feel. Sliky, rich and decadent. Dont confuse this for not being sweet; it is super sweet. But awesome in small amounts. Holy hell this is tasty.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2275,"2015-05-31",4.3,"Taster at the source. This spent 6!!! years in apple brandy barrels. Wow! Pours dark brown with a touch of beige head. Big apple aroma, with lots of oak, chocolate, raisins, dates. Smells amazing. This is flat, but still has a silky mouth. Flavor is chocolate, oak, raisin, date, calvados. Smooth as hell.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
2275,"2015-05-30",4.1,"First beer in a long day of visiting breweries in NH & Maine. Enjoyed at Smuttlabs. Really nice, dark berry colored pour, dried fruits, apple brandy richness, wood, boozy quad. Wonderful flavors, complex, very impressed","Buffalo, New York, USA","swoopjones"
