3708,"2017-05-02",1.8,"Short stubby bottle like the one pictured but the label is different, it says red ale prominently. Big malty aroma that follows a milder malty nose. First taste is aged ale like. Decent co2, but yes this is quite like an irish ale of the old country, I think. Difficult, does not hide its abv attribute, its there, get used to it. Reddish? Not too sure, its more like orange brown yellow, 314. Whew. Becomes a little difficult in the end, but it is beer.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

3708,"2016-11-16",3.4,"Poured into a mug, the appearance was a ruddy semi-dark burnt red color. Quickly dissipating fingers worth of white foamy head. Mild stringy lacing.
The aroma centers around some sweet nuts, caramel tones, light tofffee, some toast.

On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Medium carbonation. Malts create a nice smoothness on my tongue.

Aroma of toast, roasted barley malts, nuts, earthy hops, some fruits- a nice, simple and traditional aroma for this style.

Porter that lagered just wonderfully in a fridge for two years, so heres hoping: Pours a robust head in my glass, above a darkish red ale with tiny bits of grain or yeast sediment floating around. Smell is fine, a nice caramel roast malt that may or may not have subsided in strength, but did not go off. Im sticking my thumb up for its taste, too. A robust kind of caramel malt again, just a little bit sticky Alcohol is probably a touch higher than the stated abv what with the secondary ferment; it certainly is noticeable here. I thought I caught a touch of unmalted wheat here, and sure enough, the label has it in the ingredients. Rough grain finish, but very entertaining.

3708,"2010-09-14",3.6,"Appearance:

This Irish ale pours a dark amber almost to the point of being light brown. Pouring it from a bottle into a pint glass generated little to no head, maybe about half a finger of an off white cream colored head. There is very little carbonation and no yeast sediment which surpised me since it is a bottle conditioned beer.

Aroma:

The nose is dominated by malt. It smelled like caramel, raisin, and has a few notes that remind me of a bock. I am picking up a little toastiness too, It is quite nice.

Taste:

The taste is good. You get subtle malts and hops playing together quite nicely. The hop characteristics really give the beer a good bitter touch to the end of the sweet malts you get up front. And they dont dance away, they really stick to your tongue for a long finish.

Palate:

Light to Medium body that will develop a nice head in your mouth when you swish the beer around.

Overall:

The beer is enjoyable, but doesnt stand out as anything amazing. It is a middle of the road Irish Ale. I would prefer it over Killians any time it was presented, but wouldnt drink it on a daily basis.","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","Fanbrew"

The taste had plenty of floral sweetness, but it had a welcome pungency that seemed to pass for bitterness - regardless, it seemed a little more balanced than I was expecting.

The medium to small sized head stuck around for a small period of time. Nose is of toasted malt, burt caramel, some wheat, and english style hops. Taste is watery and very typical of the rest of boulevards brews. There are many things about this beer that remind me of NBs fat tire but I would also say it is not as good or balanced. Just so-so","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
3708,"2008-02-14",3.4,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2008 Deep amber body with an off-white head. The head dissipated quickly, though, and there wasnt a lace to speak of. Fruity and somewhat acidic aroma at first, and then just plain dried fruit after the head diminished. Malty and subdued dried fruit flavors initially, and then the hops appeared in the finish. The aftertaste seems to be dominated by the malts, but I guess thats to be expected with this style. The flavor is best experienced as the beer warms up a bit, so Id recommend that you dont serve it too cold. Good carbonation, yet I think it might be a little on the fizzy side. Overall, this is a respectable beer, but one six-pack will probably be enough for the season.","USA","DJC"

I got this bottle as an extra in a recent trade with Vancer, thanks again Vance! Boulevards Irish Ale pours a fairly clear amber but upon closer inspection theres some tiny floating sediment that takes away a bit of the clarity. A one finger white head appeared on the pour that fell to a thin cap and left spotty lacing on its way down.

A bit of caramel and toasty malts greet the nose upfront. Theres a noticeble earthy spiy hoppiness throught. Maybe my minds plying tricks on me but every now and then I pick up a whiff of pineapple.

While not an exciting ale this is a good one. Irish reds seem to be a tough style to really make stand out and Boulevards version is no different but it is enjoyable. A solid helping of caramel maltiness is accompanied by a touch of toasted graininess. The hopping creates a nice balance and rings in earthy and spicy just like the aroma suggested. Finishes with a touch of lingering bitterness.

This beer sports a medium body with a smooth velvetiness. The mouthfeel fits the style really well and keeps it an enjoyable drinker.

Drinkability is good. The balanced flavor, mouthfeel, and low abv all make for a truly quaffable Irish red.

A good example of hte style from Boulevard. Irish Reds are a style I cant really get to excited about but this would be a good beer to drink if you were sitting down for a game or in a more social situation where more than a few would be consumed in a night. Thanks Vance!

12 oz bottle from Royal in Kansas City, Missouri. Best by 04/12/10 stamped on the bottle. Pour is mostly clear copper amber with a thick full 2 inch light tan head. Aroma is mild biscuit caramel toasted malt along with a floral hoppiness. The two combine together for a sharpness, which makes it a bit abrasive. Taste is the sweetness of the nose, though now its equal parts caramel and fruit sweetness, followed by the floral hops and finishing with a nice mineral element.  The meld and balance between malt and hops works better in the taste versus the nose. Palate is thin to medium, crisp and dry on the finish - real easy to drink.

Light bodied with way too much carbonation.  An easy drinking beer, but not a whole lot to get excited about.

Although its an irish ale, I couldnt help but think this what a beer should like in a british pub -stupid american i suppose mixing the two, especially since my dad used to live in england.  Anyways, back to the beer, the aroma was carmel, malts, bread, apple sweetness.  The taste is appley, malty, hoppy, wheat, caramel, and slightly metallic.

3708,"2005-06-06",4.1,"Ive rated this beer high in one sense because its so true to the best of what Ive seen from this style. Dark brown color with short head. Fierce carbonation and very liquid (not thin) body. Aroma is simple, straightforward malt, but the flavor ushers in more complex elements of mango syrup, lots of hops and cardamom seed. Very strong hop bitterness and fiery carbonation appear out of thin air on the palate. Compare this along with the perennial Harp product (an ok beer in its own right) and its an excellent introduction to the strongly-carbonated Irish style.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","BeerAteHer"

Roasted malt with enough hops to balance, although hops are certainly in the background. A solid brewpub beer and more flavorful than average for the style. In fact, I see that it is the 2nd highest rated beer in the style behind only Dublin 1798 Revolution Red. Creamy caramel notes come out about a quarter of the way in. A little higher in alcohol than the style calls for, but that is good, because as a fairly subtle sytle, the added strength helps it stand apart. This brew really improves as it warms.

Not much of an aroma besides fresh/crisp pineish hops.  The flavor was dope-ish (i.e., almost amazing): subdued sweetness on the fluffy malt transitioned into a great level of bitter hops that lingered long into the finish.  Slightly buttery, smooth, well-balanced.  Perfect body: was stout enough to hold up the hops, but still felt crisp and light in the mouth without being watery.  Well done, Boulevard.

3708,"2002-07-05",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2004 A nicely balanced Irish-style amber ale, with caramel maltiness and  spicy, floral hop towards the finish.  Recipe for this one seems to vary annually a bit.  Certainly one of the most flavorful and all-around best Irish ales one is likely to find.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
3708,"2002-06-22",3.0,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2003 Deep clear- amber in color, has a nice white head that doesn't last very long, light malty bready aroma. Sweet caremel malty flavor, mild hop profile it does have a nice clean dry finish, medium body, seems kind of bland, overall not all that bad but average.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MaxPower"
3708,"2002-05-25",3.4,"Garnet in color; Head was large but fleeting; Pleasent nose of malt. A passable beer. Would be great in the right setting- perhaps the brewery or a patio full of hotties.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
3708,"2002-05-05",3.4,"Very nice balance between malts and hops.  Im really not sure what an Irish Ale is but this reminded me of an American Amber Ale only with more subdued hops or else George Killians with hops. I really enjoyed.","Wilmar, Arkansas, USA","HarmonKill-a-Brew"
3708,"2002-02-25",4.1,"Exceptional bottle-conditioned ale.  Most so-called Irish Ales are usually middle of the road red ales, but this is very nice.  The color is a nice red-amber, with a firm head and excellent lacing.  Aroma is caramel, with some herbal hops and a tinge of smokiness.  The flavor is perfectly balanced: caramel malt and Englishy hops, plus a slight smokiness.  Creamy mouthfeel.  Very very drinkable and characterful.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
3708,"2002-02-15",3.6,"A good beer.  Hard to compare it to other irish ales as the only other irish beer I have had is guiness which isnt of the same style.","California, USA","Beloved Beer"
3708,"2002-02-05",4.0,"Wonderful representation of this obscure style. Real nice head, beautiful, stained-mahogany color. Some floaties from the bottle conditioning, but thats expected. Buttery nose. Smooth, woodsy taste, complemented with a burnt roastiness. Left behind a gentle smokiness and a mouthwatering sweetness... and a little hop zing, as if it were icing on the cake.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
3708,"2002-01-29",4.1,"2002 version:  Absolutely wonderful.  IMO the best offering from this marvelous brewery.   Excellent malt flavor, beautiful appearance and appreciable head.  The only things I see need improvement are the lack of aroma and the fact that this is seasonal.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"
3708,"2001-08-30",3.7,"Good shot at a difficult style. Toasty, warming, and overall very pleasant.","LaVista, Nebraska, USA","K-V-F-L"
