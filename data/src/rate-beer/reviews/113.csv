113,"2015-07-05",4.3,"2 oz sample from bottle (375 ml) bought @ LFC. Vintage 2013 (3000 bottles).

Appearance: Clear bright golden-orange with nice legs. 

Aroma: Bright fruitiness with vibrant apple presence along pears, apricots, nutmeg, caramel, a bit of alcohol but nothing overpowering and a bit of oak. 

Taste: Medium sweetness (for the style) with moderate acidity, a bright fruitiness (apples, pears, apricots), caramel, nut, oak, wood spiciness, peppery notes... this is serious stuff. 

Palate: Medium to full body. Sirupy mouthfeel and rather thick but theres also a nice oaky presence in the mouthfeel. Fruity finish. Mouth coating. 

Overall: I didnt think that a blend of Neige Première and Neige Réserve would be that good to be honest. It brings out some components that arent in either of those (like the peppery presence), but it also keep the better of both like the oak presence (from Neige Réserve) and the bright fruitiness (from Neige Première). Complex, well balanced and really tasty. Nice stuff!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Aroma is bursting with notes of apple pie, cinnamon, toasted raisin bread and of course lots of sweet rich apples. Mouthfeel is full bodied and rich with notes of apple pie, cinnamon, vanilla, additional spices, rich apple juice and apple sauce coated with cinnamon. Another incredible ice cider from Neige.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"

Smell is intoxicating with apple sugar, skins, caramel toast, oak, and more rich and concentrated apple. Flavor is just as pleasing with layers of apple complexity. Slightly warming in the belly.
