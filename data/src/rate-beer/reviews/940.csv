940,"2017-06-16",3.5,"Oedipus take on steam beer - or California common as it is respectfully (and compulsory) called by other brewers than Anchor, one of very few indigenous American beer styles and the only one to survive till this day, thanks to Anchor.  Originally produced for a restaurant called CT Coffee and Coconuts at the Ceintuurbaan, also in Amsterdam (why the beer style of choice was a steam beer, escapes me a bit, though).  Apparently made the right way, i.e. with lager yeast at higher temperatures, but hopped with Cascade, which clearly did not exist yet when steam beer was at its height; yet Cascade being virtually the father of this new generation of American hops, I guess this is an appropriate choice. Opens with a hissing sound - the suggestion of steam escaping is already there - but no gushing. Thick and frothy, crackling, off-white, regularly shaped, moussy head, keeping closed apart from a few gaps in the middle, on top of an almost clear beer with some small flakes of protein floating around throughout, perturbed by strings of lively fizz and warm peach blonde in colour with metallic orange hue, shifting to an equally misty orange with sediment. Aroma of peaches, melting butterscotch candy, fresh orange peel, dried apricot, field flowers, old toast, something sweaty, hints of damp hay, vague melon (stronger with sediment), damp cloth, soap, white pepper, cooked carrots somewhere. Crisp, lively onset due to fizzy carbonation, very minerally, piercing through a subtle fruitiness reminiscent of peach and slight pineapple, sweetish but not sweet, with a surrounding sourish touch enhanced by the carbonation; light, fizzy, pleasant but eventually somewhat soapy mouthfeel. Faint stings of grapefruit bitterness appear early on and, alongside the sweetish peachy fruitiness, travel downwards over a smooth, cereally pale malt sweetishness thickened by a more rounded caramelly factor; pleasantly (lightly) bready finish due to a play of malt sweetishness and yeast, with minerally notes hanging around over a soft, subtly growing hop bitterness, assuming the character of the white underside of an orange peel and a dash of dried bitter herbs, providing agreeable and very quenching dryness, as well as some slight grapefruit peel notes retronasally; ends juicy and malty with this hop bitterness as a perfect balance and a faintly earthy and bready yeast note. The touch of sweatiness in the nose and the soapy feeling in the mouth seem a bit out of place in a California common, but in general terms, this is a fine beer, light and refreshing, with a nice rounded malt body, a restrained fruitiness to it and a pleasant hop bitter tail (though I wouldnt mind the Cascade being a bit more pronounced - I know it doesnt belong in a traditional California common, but if you decide upon using it anyway, then why not emphasizing its aroma a bit more...). Another nice, easily drinkable Oedipus session beer, certainly very well-made from a technical point of view, close to flawless and with certain subtleties here and there to keep it interesting. Proof that this brewery is able to produce more restrained, classically composed, subtle beer types just as well as the more outgoing ones...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
