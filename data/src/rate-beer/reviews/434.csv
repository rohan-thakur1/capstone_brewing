434,"2016-09-19",3.5,"Aroma:

Slight aroma of malts, bread, fruit, hops and citrus.

Appearance:

Turbid golden/amber beer with a slight/medium white/off-white head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts and fruit; ends slightly bitter and dry with bread, hops and citrus.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense and balanced, but lacks complexity. A really creamy palate makes this beer complete. Decent, but nothing mindbogglingly.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"
