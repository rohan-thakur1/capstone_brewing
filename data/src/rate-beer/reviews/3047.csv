Thats why I was concerned that the 3 years of aging that this bottle had undergone would be a detriment. I need not have worried. Doggie Claws still had plenty of resinous bitterness. There was a nice caramel malt backbone in place, but the hops were still dank with pine and grapefruit zest.

3047,"2015-08-04",3.7,"I loved Adam and I loved Fred, so Im excited to try Doggie Claws tonight. Its a bit warm for something as rich as a Barley Wine, so Im glad that I have an excuse. It may rain and cool everything off tonight. Thats good enough for me.
I set out my snifter and find the guitar that opens most of my bottles, and pry up the cap. No huge aroma from the neck, so I pour the first glass. The liquid is the color of dark caramel, almost no head at all, just a thin bubbly lacing that races across the surface and clings desperately to the inside of the glass. Its clear and clean, and the aroma is starting to make itself clear as well. Firstly, this is hot...boozy. The aroma stings my nostrils as I breathe in the heady, thick scent; a burning incense of clover honey and ripe, honey soaked figs; a piney hops-infused bite adds so much to the sting. -- 
The first swallow is flat, though rich, and yes...very, very boozy. Tasty as hell, though, with the honey and hops both a predominant accent to the brew, a smoky vanilla caramel underlying the two and sticking to my tongue with such a tenacity! Each tilt of the glass coats my mouth with a cloying sweetness, drawing me back, swallow after swallow. -- The lack of any carbonation at all is distracting, but the rest of the beer is amazing. The finish is consistent, and warmer, in this case, is only better for the aroma and not the remainder of the experience. Because of the lack of action, I find it difficult to enjoy at higher temps, but right out of the cooler, its awesome. Id probably try this again, because I wonder that there was absolutely no head and its so flat. Maybe the second time is a charm?

Poured a brown murky color with about one finger of tan head that dissipated almost immediately. Seemed to be a lot of sediment at the bottom of the glass. Minimal lacing on the sides of the glass. Minimal retention on the tops of the glass.

Smelled a potent mix of hops and malts from the get-go. Got sugary caramel malts, brown sugar, Werthers candy, toffee, honey, Amarillo hops (I think), earthy hops, grass hops and some type of liquor.

Tasted so damn smooth from the get-go, really the opposite of what I was expecting. Got Werthers candy, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, honey, butterscotch and buttery malts.

Medium body. Oily texture. Soft carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish. Alcohol was well hidden. Best part of the beer by far. 

Nowhere as good as I hoped it would be, especially considering the $6.99 price tag on a 12-oz. bottle. Very smooth and a nice sipping beer though.","","User134089"

3047,"2013-12-18",3.9,"2013 bottling picked up today at Home Brew Stuff in Garden City... Paid a pretty expensive $7... but oh well, probably not going to see them at any other stores.

Thankfully the new batch shows no overt carbonation problems (neither dead flat or explosively carbonation)... Pours with a 2 finger khaki head atop a fairly clear deep cherry wood brew... nice lacing.

Nose is pretty nice.. toasty malt and malty wort.. bright citrus hoppiness... Pretty pungent hops with warmth... I like this vintage.

Flavor mirrors the aroma but with a light punch of yeasty frutiness that makes me think of apricot.. light caramel and stone fruits.. rummy but in a good way.. big American hops.. but still there is an earthy hop component.

Body is lightly viscous but ever present yet creamy carbonation.. a sipper but I will always want another drink. Very fine.

Crap... I frequently pass on cellaring Doggie Claws because of the random QC issues... This batch is in the cross-hairs right now.... but will it stay there?

Deep ruby tinted body with a rich amber, copper and brown body, all with a nice, single centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of amazingly complex scotch, malt, vanilla, oak, brown sugar, bourbon, metal and tons of pit fruits - very nice and ridiculously complex for a smell - even for the style. Full-bodied; Deep dense toasted malt flavours, coupled with tons of hops (still noticeable after 2+ years), earthy and deeply bittering brown sugar and caramel, some pit fruits with a little coffee flavour and a rich, dry, oaky and pine flavour that lasts quite a while. Aftertaste really brings out the complexity with malt, caramel and toffee really showing through with a good hoppy flavour showing some bitterness for a well-rounded flavour. Overall, a great barley wine and one well worth saving - even for 5+ years, it will only get better for the foreseeable future.

All were good, from the still hoppy 11 to the perfectly balanced 05, to the oxidized 03 that honestly seemed like a completely different recipe. Good stuff, all around, and really a perfect beer to set down for a few years if youre interested in learning what age can do to beers.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"

Flavors are right along lines of the aroma, however, they seem a bit understated and sometimes hard to pull out. I get liquor soaked orange peel, citrus hops, breads, toffee and roast. Palate is just a tad bit overcarbonated for how I like my Barleywines, but that soon fades given a little time and temperature. Overall, a very solid American style Barleywine with upfront hops and limited sweetness.","Chandler, Arizona, USA","AZBennett"

3047,"2013-01-05",3.6,"Being a bottle conditioned ale, you have to pray to the carbonation gods prior to opening.  If you score good carb... the brew will be much closer to perfection (4.3) than the score given here.   The carbonation will be tiny tight bubbles and they will give the barleywine a brighter feel while highlighting the hoppiness of the brew.  Tasting more like a triple IPA with that honey sweetness (think Alpines ""Exponential Hoppiness"")

When the carbonation is not present.... Doggie Claws is much more viscous with little to no hoppiness.  Mahogany in color with classic Barleywine maltiness made even sweeter by the Mt. Hood wildflower honey thats used.  The alcohol is completely hidden by the overly sweet taste.

3047,"2012-10-18",3.9,"12 oz. bottle served in a Deschutes tulip. 2011 vintage. Big thanks to mfavoino for hooking me up with this guy. 

A: Pours a murky dark brown color that resembles a dull penny. A thick head forms on the pour. Light tan colored and about two fingers in height. It takes a while to die down, but it leaves thick sheets of sticky lace on the glass.

S: Definitely on the hoppier side of the barleywines Ive had. They have a slight resin smell to them with some residual burnt sugars and a malty sweet ending.

T: The taste is just as hop forward as the nose. Resiny and grassy hops are the main hop flavor profile with a nice pale malt and whole wheat bread crust malt backbone. There is a nice flowery sweetness and a green bitterness on the finish. The booze is barely present.

M: Medium bodied with above average carbonation for the style. It makes it easy to drink and with a ton of flavor this is nice.

O: An easy drinking and flavorful barleywine is always great. The booze isnt noticeable at all and the flavors are pretty solid. Ive got another one in the cellar and am excited for what a year or two will do to this as Id like to see the carbonation die down and the hops ease back a bit.

3047,"2012-08-10",3.8,"Bottle shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike!

The appearance is dark brown with a thin head that leaves just a little lacing on the glass.

The nose brings a heavy dose of sweet malt, along with caramels and alcohol.

The flavor is quite sweet, with flavors of toffee and caramel chews soaked in alcohol. A nice, slow sipper on a cold day.

Medium to full in body, with alcohol content masked pretty well, given the 11.5% abv.

Not as complex or wonderful as Adam, but a very good example of the style nonetheless. I would definitely drink this again.

Pours a dank murky brown with a creamy beige head that sticks around. Aroma is intense of huge sweet caramel and grapefruit citrus, bitter pine and raisin - definitely can tell it is on the fresher side. Taste is incredibly sweet - butterscotch, toffee, grapefruit, dark fruits and honey. There are some slight floral notes as well. Lighter body than expected - medium and chewy. 

Overall this is fantastic, the best American style barleywine Ive had. There is a big fresh hop presence but does not over power.","Park Ridge, Illinois, USA","timc100"

Aroma has some fruity hops and sweetish malt typical to American Barley Wines. Rather rich palate. Flavour is sweetish with caramel, some hops, resin and fruits. A bit too sweet for me  and actually this feels a bit thin for an 11% ABV beer. But good stuff still with a perfect balance.

Also a huge maltiness with caramel, dates and raisins. The 06 is more malt forward and has a more rich and complex caramel side to it. The oxidation that is present in both really hits the sweet spot where it adds to the complexity without adding an off taste. This stuff tasted sooooo good.

4.5 S: This is still hoppy as hell. Really wonderful aroma on this. Tons of herbal hops with pine undertones. The barleywine underneath all the hops is toasty with caramel and plentiful fruitiness in the form of apple and overripened peach.

3.5 T: The taste, however, is a bit unrefined, though this is still good overall. The hops seem to be in an awkward state at the moment. The flavor is herbal as well. Caramel with toffee and plenty of light fruitiness.

The nose: Shy aromas of fruity hops with caramel and honey biscuits.  The taste:  Hops and sweets malts are there but in a quiet way.  The mouthfeel: Body seems to be less than medium.  Carbonation is too strong.  Texture is just wrong, not the type that you expect from a barley wine.  The finale:  Few bites from hops and sugar from malts.  The conclusion:   Too bad, we had a contaminated bottle.  These are things that happen.  However, it was not a disaster. This shows perhaps that this beer is a blast of flavors.  Looking to drink this beer again.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

3047,"2011-10-13",4.4,"Picked up at the Matt / Doggie Claws release November 2010. In line early just after opening at 10AM. Held on until this moment. Excited. Smelled it and its fucking awesome. Solid bright deep orange amber with a small compact light tan head that lasts a long time. The aroma is just stupidly good. Massive hops. Peaches, nectarine, orange, sweet honey, strawberries, hint of sweat, maybe mint, some biscuity malts I think, berries, very light caramel, excellence. The taste is no slouch either. No ingredient mess. Amazing flavour - yea, a lot of the same things Ive found before but just that much better - like eating at a high end restaurant - the use of better ingredients makes the occasion special. Citrus, Nectarine big time, orange, spice, no alcohol, not pine but somewhat sort of there, peaches, softness, caramel here and there but nothing dominant. Great subdued sweetness that flows smoothly across my taste buds. AAAAA tastes so good. Why do I only have one small 12 oz bottle? Man, I fucked up by not buying more of these.

2008 vintage received as an extra in a trade and consumed fresh.

Pours a dark, murky golden orange/swampy brown color with burnt orange hues and a one finger off white head that quickly fades. I poured half of the bottle out and there are large chunks of yeast floating in the glass. This beer looks pretty awful.

Earthy soil like aroma with hints of leathery malt, dirt, alcohol solvency and lots of earthy piney hops.

Medium bodied with lots of alcohol sweetness up front. This is counters by a blast of resinous, earthy hops that give off a nice bitter, dry pine needle flavor. There is also a decent amount if citrus flavor especially grapefrut and orange peel. This is again countered mid-palate by a prominent earthy, leathery malt presence.

3047,"2011-02-06",3.7,"Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle in a chalice.  The beer pours a medium to slightly dark amber color, with a moderate white head that lessens, but still remains for essentially the duration of the samples consumption.  The nose shows strong English medium-high and high crystal malt; brown sugar, raison, and candied prune.  As the sample appears to have some age on it, hop notes have fallen away.  The palate is full, in-your-face, and unmistakably that of a Barley Wine-style ale.  Raison, slight sherry notes, caramel, molasses, and a slight tinge of character-adding alcohol come through.  Residual sweetness levels are high, coming quite close to being cloying.  Carbonation is nicely calibrated.  Mouthfeel is full, without being inappropriately filling.  The general flavor profile of the sample is not unlike a tawny port.  The finish is long, sweet, and full of English crystal malt character.  Overall, an example of the style that is pleasant, but highly aggressive, and close to being unbalanced.  Enjoyable.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

3047,"2011-01-28",4.0,"12 ounce bottle. 2010 vintage. Poured into Duvel tulip. Side note: Heard this vintage was extremely carbonated. 
 
APPEARANCE: Foam started to rise out of the bottle once the cap was removed. Massive beige, cream-colored head is thick and frothy. Head has extremely long duration, which eventually begins to settle slowly and unevenly  in a rocky manner.  Effervescence everywhere  unlike some common ales that may have a steady stream of carbonation rising, generally, from the center  you can see the carbonation trails on the sides of the glass about every half centimeter. For the thickness of the beer, effervescence is quite rapid; although it does seem as though the carbonation is battling the viscosity in its quest to the top. Actually the carbonation trails appear to be rising at several different speeds. The massive amount of carbonation rising to the top seems to suspend quite a bit of sediment all throughout the beer; slowing down the fall of the sediment towards the bottom. General color of the beer is deep caramel. Ridiculous amount of sediment at the bottom of the glass. Most of the huge sediment beginning to settle at the bottom is a pale yellow/mustard color and looks like butternut squash flavored baby food. The amount of sediment seems equal to about a quarter of a small jar of baby food. While I would generally consider this much sediment somewhat detrimental to the overall appearance, the appearance of this beer is one of the most complex I have ever seen. 
 
AROMA: Strong hops and caramel aromas, which are very well-balanced. Grass and citrus hops, as well as some subtle pine and earthy notes. Malt is huge amounts of toffee and caramel. Faint note of candy (eg, salt water taffy). Some dough, though largely covered by malt sweetness. 
 
TASTE: Citrus (more orange than lemon) hops with hint of grass on front palate. Honey sweetness mid palate. Caramel and faint dark bread/graininess on back of palate. Alcohol warmth on finish is medium length. Finish is complex interplay of heavy caramel malt sweetness, alcohol warmth, and hop bitterness. 
 
MOUTH FEEL: Lively carbonation helps reduce some of the perceived viscosity, making it seem less viscous than it appears. 
 
OVERALL: A monster of an ale, especially in appearance. Complex aroma and taste. Viscous. Excellent after dinner slow-slipping ale/digestif.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"

3047,"2010-12-28",4.0,"Shipped to me by my wife on a trip to Portland. Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a cloudy dark brown color with some chunks and had a medium sized tan head that left good lacing. The aroma was strong rough pine and sour fruits with a touch of mint. The flavor was sweet yet bitter with strong pine and light notes of grapefruit, lemon, mint, spruce, toffee and nut. A sweet malty base tries to come through but get repeatedly beaten down by the strong hop presence. The finish was long, bitter, fruity and piney. Thick and full body. Well done.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"

3047,"2010-12-08",4.4,"2010, 11% ABV. Even though young, this is one wicked nice brew. Lots of floral hops and alcohol aroma and very nice frothy light tan head. Swirling produces a thick frothy head with light lacing. very intersting to see that head come back so strong. Almost like mousse or whipped cream. Pours wood brown and a bit cloudy, but that could be from quite a large amount of yeast left in the bottle.

Flavor is sweet, strong, with a nice balance of malt and bitter. Really I get a lot of honey, full coating of tongue, and a very slow fade of flavor. Medium to thick body, almost chewy. As it warms up, I taste more citrus, like tangerine, but still warm sweetness. Wonderful, memorable beer. Definitely putting some away for later. Tasted from the bottle @ 62F.","POULSBO, Washington, USA","MarinaMarket"
3047,"2010-12-07",4.5,"Appearance: cloudy brown; wood. Khaki head retains a mousse-like texture even as it fades into a tight thick blanket; solid. Swirls with no lace and an even thicker head.

Nose: sweet boozy spice in the back makes for good first impressions; tickles eyes and nose. Apples, raisins, plum skins, pear skins, and stewed mandarin skins. The sweetness (maple) in back is gentle, mingling with the pear, mandarin, and possible even a tiff of mango. Black root and a hint of vanilla bean. Spice spliced wood, barreled rum if you please.

Palate: wow and OMG. Sweet, wholly coating all oral surfaces from the front to the middle; lips. Dry, spiced, and wonderfully woody in the back. Apple, pears, raisins, and plums start tart then turn sweet. Cinnamon sticks, rum spice, and wood mingle and marry. Maple and caramel linger longest on the lips. Quite sessionable for her rich intensity. Warmth slowly tickles the back of throat before settling comfortably in my chest. Chocolate oranges; marmalade and mandarin.

Final Thoughts: how can one not love a beer from a brewery called Hair of the Dog?! Even better, their beers are quite often out of this world tastetacular. Chalk this beast right up there with the best of them.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Full bodied, lingering sweetness and a hint of alcohol on the back end. Although the hops are minty fresh, it seems that this beer would benefit from a bit of aging to mellow out the sweetness a bit.

M: Pretty full mouthfeel with little carbonation and just a bit of alcohol heat.

Taste is not too thick, slight piney hops poke through but mostly a caramel and crystal malt forward offering with a bit of a soapy component. Mint flavors still abound.

3047,"2010-07-14",4.4,"It pours out in a brownish, amber color with a nice tan head. It has decent retention and is nicely laced. Hops are very noticeable in the aroma and also has a sugary type of smell. Im guessing its like a honey smell. The taste is where the beer really shines. The hops adds bitterness into the fold and its balanced with the sweetness of the supporting flavors. Like the smell Im guessing the supporting flavor is honey with a bit of another flavor that I cant seem to place. It has very light carbonation so it goes down so smooth. It also feels smooth going down which adds to the charm. My only real gripe is that you can taste the alcohol pretty well but thats to be expected considering its a pretty strong 11.5% abv.

Didnt matter, the murky appearance of this beer actually started to add to its mystique once I sipped it. Aroma is noticeably hoppy and boozy, a rather hot mixture of pine, sweet candied orange, cherry syrup and alcohol.  The flavor just takes you to another planet, though!  Bold notes of apricot, cherry pine, pressed flowers, and honey just burst out of the glass.  Suprisingly, the alcohol doesnt get in the way as suggested by the aroma.

3047,"2010-03-13",2.6,"Im considering pioneering a new measurement of human activity specific to beer drinkers.  At the core of the measurement is how long it takes a RateBeer user to write a review after drinking a beer.  This is made most clear when looking back on reviews for Christmas beers which were punctually enjoyed around Christmas.  And yet here I am quickly glancing over my notes in the somewhat Springy month of May.  I think this could be considered a fair amount of time.  It helps, though, that the Doggie Claws from Hair of the Dog is more or less an unforgettable beer.  I am always unsettled with a beer pours out without so much as a single loud mouthed bubble barking out its last pop.  But the Doggie Claws does just this, sliding out of the bottle like a corpse, and settling like mercury.  The body is a nice mahogany brown, but theres all kinds of yeasty and particulate matter, even some evocative of phlegm.  This wouldnt be so bad if I wasnt already feeling I was conducting some kind of drinkable necromancy.  Surprisingly the aroma is vivacious, like fresh paint, mostly due to a sharp edge of alcohol.  But its strong too, and its hard for me to find much else here besides a rush of alcohol vapors.  The taste completes the experience, with its viscous, strong, and repelling flavors.  Foremost is the aftertaste, genuinely sweet and somewhat enjoyable with oozing pine and molasses.  But everything before that is a jarring blend of orange, bitterness, and an unexpected appearance of a raspberry-chocolate duo.  But overall, the flavor is mostly alcohol, which to me indicates skewed flavor priorities.  This beer is all over the place, and doesnt really whet the appetite, or satiate it.  Its just there, and pales compared to other widespread seasonal.  Maybe thats why I waited until March to write about it.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

3047,"2010-03-09",3.8,"2009 bottle poured on 3/9/10.  Pours hazy burnt caramel colored with little to no head.  This was a vigorous pour from 8"" above the glass and left hardly anything.  Aroma is treacle, caramel, lavender, apple pie/cinnamon.  Incredibly sweet, with hardly any hops to balance.  Great mild spice flavor to go with the caramel, but Im looking for a tiny bit more bitterness.  Very good English style barleywine, but I was expecting west coast.  Full bodied, rich, buttery mouthfeel, but little to no carbonation.  Some barley wines are fine flat, but I think this couldve benefited a bit from a bit more carbonation.   Also, just noticed that the ABV is 11.5% and this doesnt taste anywhere near that high.  Alcohol is hidden extremely well and this is extremely drinkable.  A great beer that I would love to lay down for a few years.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","cprochak"

Lightly spicy as well.   Full bodied, syrupy, sticky, and lower on carbonation.   Interesting, but a bit to syrupy and sweet overall.

Pours a deep amber color (the second pour looked muddy brown) with a nice initial frothy head and a thin layer of retention.  The aroma is nice; maple, honey, grapefruit, caramel, some smoke and maybe even cherry.  A very good barleywine.  Plums, tobacco, brown sugar flavors, sweet caramel and toffee malt, balanced by grapefruit and bitter leafy hops.  Towards the end of the bottle it gets quite resiny.  The 11.5% provides some warmth but otherwise is hardly noticed.

I got this doggy in a trade with a generous BA who gave me a 2004 vintage; nice! The beer was poured into a snifter. The color was muddy-brown and red. The head was almost nonexistent save for a few white bubbles clinging to the side. The taste was a little chocolate and cocoa. The alcohol was prickly on my tongue. Very strong beer and good but I still prefer Bigfoot and Old Boardhead.

2/16/08 2007 Vintage

Thanks to vwcraig for the bottle as part of a recent trade. I wanted to re-review this as I have not had it fresh (or close to fresh). Nice appearance, hazy orange-red with a film of bubbles and a ring around the outside. The smell is immediately hoppy and awesome. I think I can almost smell the honey too but that may be the power of suggestion from the label. Slight hint of alcohol fumes but damn the smell is so good. I had to bump the smell score up a bit. The taste is very good and unlike any barleywine Ive had. Super hoppy and the honey is detectable with a sweet flavor. Now I just need to find some for my cellar!

04/11/08 2002 vintage 10% abv

I was able to score a couple bottles thanks to a BA mentioning a store in CO that sells vintage beers. I was told this was past its prime but it was only $3 so I figured why not? The color is a light orange with a decent head that recedes but is still a one cm layer of bubbles. The aroma is instant oxidation but then lots of cherries and fruits, interesting. The body is kinda thin but the flavor is still good, dark fruits but the flavor seems to run from my palate. It gives you a good idea and then its gone.
This is still a good beer but I would agree that it is probably past its prime and I dont see it getting any better, just thinner.

3047,"2009-12-26",4.0,"Blue cap courtesy of craftycarl21. A wondrous start to the 21st birthday tasting. Well carbonated despite recent troubles. Brown pour with hints of toffee and a small white lively head. Some sediment finds its way to the bottom, but overall she looks beautiful. Aroma first presents in a hop oriented manner- lots of spruce and resin with a warming kick of nasal warming booze. Malt character is caramel and biscuity in nature, but the evergreen is inescapable. The malt character is much more prevalent in the flavor: caramel and floral honey swirl together in a sweet torrent of deliciousness. Hop profile is much less pronounced than the aromatic bouquet might suggest, but acts to provide an excellent sappy evergreen balance. Booze character is far less noticeable in the flavor and almost goes unnoticed in the wake of such a defined sweet malt presence despite its rather high content. Palate is rich, velvety, syrupy, and chewy with a nice fine bubbled effervescence and and smacking but clean finish.

3047,"2009-12-26",4.1,"The first beer of what promises to be perhaps the best tasting of my life.

Malt is much more pronounced in the flavor, with heavy molasses, honey, caramel, toast, but still the great Simcoe bitterness and dark, piney hop character. Palate is luscious; not too thick, but the sweetness and bitterness are beautifully complimentary. The 11.5% is warming and welcome, but not aggressive, more of a massaging booziness.

Fairly nuanced beer, but I think some time on this one would really improve the aroma, and bring out those malts a bit more. Definitely get a sweet subtle honey aroma.

No pfffft at all when opening the bottle. Very little foam in the beer. Toffee/amber colour. Aroma from butterscotch, heavy malt and caramel. Big malty flavour, with wood, toffee and light chocolate. Bit cellary in flavour, with flat-ish, dead mouthfeel, despite the big maltiness. Berries come to mind. Hops are long gone - in aroma as well as in bitterness. Definitely not perfect at this age.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rickgordon"

When I say lasting, I mean its there until you drain the glass. Fuckin excellent. The aroma really stops you in your tracks. The Amarillo is just about there in the background but this one is all about the Simcoe. A fuckin superb hop and this one really shouts its praises. Backed up by some stunning sugary caramel malt and just the right amount of fruit along with some ridiculous but loveable peppery alcohol notes. Shit, I really could take a good while sniffing at this. The flavour is just as spank my arse and call me Mabel excellent. This is full on loopy juice. Bring on the madness. Big malt, some honey, some faint tangerine and a shit load of sugary alcohol. This is one of those take over the world beers. Marching juice for the jilted generation.

The flavor is mostly dominated by caramel and toffee but a little bit of oxidation is noticed and some cardboard notes are creeping in.

Sweet aroma of malts, lots of fruits (bitter citrus, berry), a little bit of alcohol.  Sweet flavor of sticky caramel, honey, and fruits.  The sweetness never becomes cloying but rather the hops kick in and give this an incredible balance and a great finish.  The 10.5% is altogether hidden in this one.

3047,"2009-07-13",3.5,"12oz bottle, 2003 release
Pours a rich, dark chestnut brown with nice tight tan head. Aroma gives a hint of the lush malt and strongish hop content; some hint of raisins and a touch of soy are there too. Flavor is drier and hoppier than I had anticipated given the malt that showed up in the aroma. Dry, fairly bitter, leathery, tobacco-leafy, and finally some malt shows up. along with ints of dried tart fruit. Palate is thick and chewy. This is a well-crafted beer and hence I give it decent marks. But while I appreciate that theres some room for interpretation of the style, Im not big on examples that almost forget how the barleywine style got its name. It could have scored higher but it was just too dry, too hoppy, and not enough ""wine"" so to speak in this barleywine..","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

Nose is raisin, honey, caramel, piney hops, sugar, booze, fruit, and balance.  Flavor is magic- caramel, honey, alcohol-soaked fruit, and sweetness all over.

3047,"2009-05-24",4.3,"2005. Great, deep amber color. Very inviting aroma of citrus and melon. Begins with a sharp bitter flavor of grass and grapefruit skins, quickly bringing in a hint of orange. Just before, and after this burst, is a more delicate, sweet, malty flavor, along with a good sour which lingers. The bitter, really the whole thing, leaves the mouth nicely dry at the end. Not  hint of alcohol, not even warmth. Every taste invites another. A masterpiece of flavor. Not everything works, but still one that stands with my very best.","Minnesota, USA","EHopper"

I rated this one pretty badly at the time when I first had it, and upon looking back I honestly have no idea what the f*ck I was thinking.  I know that I tried to like it since Id heard so much about how great HOTD is.  I just didnt get it I guess, because this is just a fantastic beer.  The great caramelly malt body (which is a little much, bordering on cloying, but it works) is counter-balanced wonderfully by a perfect amount of resinous hop flavor and bitterness.  Ill have to go get more of this before it disappears off the shelves this xmas.  Cheers Alan and thanks for another great beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Tweety"

Ripe fruit, sweet malts - almost syrupy sweet. Definitely not enough on the hop end to balance this one out. Covers the alcohol well, but this one would get old after more than half a glass. Good, for sure... but not great. RE-RATE 08/09/12: After rounding out my taste, this one has kicked up a couple notches. The sweetness offered by the wild flower honey (and the massive malt bill) have become my favorite flavors in a barley wine. Hops are apparent, but sit in the background on this one -- which is how I think it should be. Tastes something like a really old English barley wine -- sweet, toffee-infused candi sugar -- just delicious. Especially if you can find it on tap.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

Still thick aromatics...the floral hops have died off significantly and the caramel has turned slightly burnt, with some alcohol bitterness.  Resiny hop oils are left lingering and tickle the nose.  Sweet strawberries, cherries and raisins make up an incredibly smooth and creamy palate.  Tart and acidic with an amazing amount of citrus left over after 5 years.  A bit of cloyed honey builds up as I work my way through the glass.

3047,"2009-01-27",4.0,"2006 Bottle thanks to MrChopin.  Just looking at the bottle, I knew I was in for a murky treat.  It poured a muddy, semi-bright brown with orange hues.  Zero head.  Looked like a strong English Breakfast tea with milk in it.  Intimidating, actually, but made me curious.  Instead of making me think of caramel flavor, this smelled and tasted like sweet, complex caramel.  Big Amarillo hop presence, too.  The combination of the hops and malt added up to a really nice creamy bready fruit taste.  Mixture of dark and lighter fruit notes. Bit of butterscotch that could perhaps indicate some oxidation.  Nice bitter finish. Thin body, but overall this was a treat.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"
3047,"2009-01-26",4.2,"Pours a dark amber, almost brown color.  Head is beige and dense.

3047,"2009-01-24",4.3,"I almost had to cry I went to put this 2005 vintage bottle that thethrone sent me in the cellar for another day and heard it hissing so I quickly chilled it down and poured it into a snifter that was a close one. We did have a gusher, so I wont get to much into the appearance, big tan head hazy apple cider colored yes floaties as well good thing I like Belgians. My score reflects giving it the benefit of the doubt

But the aromas made up for the whole gusher moment one of the best Barleywine noses I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Sweet caramel, wait is this a melted sugar daddy ;-) toffee, candy sugar, fruity as well 

A nice sweet sipper even more enjoyable as the glass goes on. the flavors folow the nose to a T. The warmth of the alcohol is still present and helps this brew from being to coy. This barleywine is medium in the mouth and sticky on the tongue.

I must say some of the brews I have had on my want list I have tried and thought wow that was a waste of space. This is not one of them, this brew is truly a must try for any barleywine fiend.

3047,"2009-01-21",4.0,"2008 bottle.  Pours a very clear glowing dark deep blood red with a slight orange tint, no bubbles, with a very small frothy white head.  Strong fresh hop aroma, spicy, perfumy, floral, fruity, stingy fresh citrus nose, sweeter red fruits, with an toasted malt undertone.  I assume fresh this is best served a bit on the cooler side because of the hops.  Strong hop forward first taste, turning dry, pretty bitter, salty and toasty before finishing with a touch of honey and hint of brown sugar.  Doesnt seem quite as complex as other HOTDs however the flavors are definitely of the same quality.  Really quite dry despite its obvious high gravity.  Unbelievably smooth and somehow creamy body, super fine soft carbonation that fluffs up a malty beer that otherwise would seem syrupy.  I have 3 other bottles for some age comparison.

Where the whole charm of this beer comes to life is in its taste.
All the hops come together with the malts for an amazing experience. All is terrifically well balanced.

There are some chocolate-milk like notes in this.  Smells soooo good.  Very muddy, murkey sludge-like brown-amber body with a nice off-yellow head.  Wow...this is like cigar tobacco.

Smell starts with a big citrus hop aroma with grapefruit up front giving way to the caramel malt and toffee background.  There is also a big sugar sweetness throughout the nose.

Taste is a bigger version of the nose with the hops up front in the form of grapefruit and lemons.  The sweetness takes over right after that burst with molasses and caramel.  There is a hint of the booze as well on top of a ton of raisins and dates before the citrus hops come back for a slightly bitter finish.

Mouthfeel is unbelievably creamy with strong carbonation that prickles the tongue.  Alcohol is present but not overpowering in the least.

This is a fantastic and original take on the style and one that I enjoyed immensely.  Another great brew from HotD.  Highly recommended!","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Sweet and meaty w/ a defined mild tartness. Flavors from nectarines, plumbs, and apricot, including kiwi, pinapple, and caramel. The finish is long and savory.

3047,"2008-07-02",3.9,"2007 vintage.  Dark, burnt-orange to caramel brown in color, the brew is crowned in a dense, foamy, beige head.  The foam displays excellent retention, leaving sudsy, spotty lacing behind.  Aromas are reminiscent of a triple IPA, with massive orange, grapefruit, and pine hop notes showing atop an equally huge malt base of caramel and buttery toffee.  This thing practically smells sticky.  Vanilla, coupled with a lactic creaminess, lends a smoothing element.  Flavors follow suit, with over the top, resinous hops countering the sweet and sticky toffee malts.  Orange and grapefruit are striking in their authenticity, while pine delivers a mouth stripping, sharp bitterness that the lactose does well to calm down.  Nearly full bodied and sugary, the swallow is smooth, ending with a drying, hoppy finish.  This is really a hybrid IIPA/barleywine through and through.  The closest comparison I can come up with is AleSmith Decadence 2006, though this doesn’t quite stack up to that masterpiece of a beer.  Overall, this is quite good, but not nearly as impressive as Fred.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Would be reason enough to move to Portland.  On to the beer: 2007 bottle. Pours deep amber with a huge fucking head. I guess it all depends on how your pour and into what glass.  I like using my rondenbach grand cru tulip because it always makes the beers look great. Nose is very hoppy, some alcohol upfront, and some light sweet malts. Flavor is very similar with a bit of hotness. Damnit, this is just how I remember it. Way too much alcohol.  I just dont feel like it blends that well together--at least for my tastes.

Smells of pineapple, lychee, peach, cherry skin, hops, and a substantial amount of toffee and caramel is lurking underneath the fruity smells.  Upon warming, the beer takes on a slightly sour smell, which detracts a bit from the initial aroma.  I think this is the oxidation. Alcohol also is evident as well.  The taste is pretty simple, but very good, with a huge blast of toffee and caramel, that switches to sweet cherry and yields to a slight tartness of cherry skin.  The finish is a light bitterness with lingering tastes of burnt caramel.  The mouthfeel of this beer is great, perfectly carbonated, and the beer is quite full and chewy.  A very well crafted barleywine, and the flavor really stands out here.
 bottle, thanks OSLO! On second tasting with a fresher bottle, I smell a lot of fresh roasted peanuts, with some toffee as well, and musty hops (which must be the Simcoe).  I also thought the flavor was excellent and tasted completely different than the first bottle I had.  The nuttiness was there in the flavor along with toffee, and a light bitterness that blended together very nicely.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

Overall an interesting note is that 02 starts off as a lighter orange and the years get darker to 04 and then they get lighter again where 07 returns to the 02 color. Along with the different colored malts these beers seemed quite a bit different from one another.  But based on our tasting, Id recomend drinking this fresh.  2003 vintage. Pours a medium red orange with a tan head. Nose is sweet toffee, brown sugar, caramel, grains and butterscotch.  It kind of reminds me a sugary kids cereal.    Swirling this brings out the unnoticed notes of oxidation and paper.  Sweet flavors, alcohol, red fruit, paper.  Dry finish.  7/3/7/3/12 = 3.2 
  2004 vintage.  Pours a dark red orange with a thin tan head.  The aroma is really vegetal and oxidized but not all together bad.  Brown sugar, red fruit, cereal grains, and dark fruit.  This one is really fruity and the oxidation gets more annoying as it warms.  Flavors are sweet.  Caramels, red fruit, boozy, a charred note i nthe finish and that papery oxidation.  7/4/7/3/13 = 3.4
  2005 vintage.  Pours a clear orange red with a thin beige head.  Nose is vegetables and tropical fruits.  Sugars, caramels, and all around sweet.  Flavors are lighter than the previous vintages.  Fruit, caramels, touch of hops that are faded but contribute nicely.  Balanced well.  This one was my second favorite of the years.  The hops are in a good place and the tropical fruit is enjoyable.  7/4/8/3/14 = 3.6  
2006 vintage.  Pours a hazed orange, almost murky with no head.  Vegetable aromas, toffee, caramel, funky malts.  They smell aged and foul.  Flavors are sweet caramels, citrus, faded hops that are grassy and annoying.  Sugarry and this tastes worse as it warms up.  This was my least favorite of the night.  5/2/6/3/12 =  2.8  
2007 vintage .  Pours a clear orange yellow with an off-white head.  Nose of fresh hops, citrus, caramel, and toffee.  Those hops smell just picked off the vine.  Nice.  Sweet toffee flavors.  Red fruit, cherries, caramels, citrus, fresh hops.  The sweetness is balanced with a good dose of hops. Tasty.  This was by far my favorite of the vintages. 8/3/8/4/15 = 3.8  So even though every beer seemed to be different, Id drink this fresh.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"

4/02/2008:  Doggie Claws Baleywine Style Ale has a warm brown appearance, slight haze, and a lasting ivory head that is dense and leaves lots of lacing effects on the inside of the glass.  This beer smells of sweet citrus and rich, creamy caramel.  The aroma is balanced and inviting.  The flavor is deeply malty with lots of caramel and aged dried fruits (such as apricot), vanilla, toasted bread, faint tobacco, with some subtle citrus and herbal hoppiness in the finish.  There is a moderate level of bitterness balanced against the large sticky malty sweetness.  The lingering flavor and aftertaste has pine, is highly floral and perfumy, and beckons one back for another sip.  This beer is surprisingly tame considering its high alcohol content, yet it provides a welcomed warmth.  The thick, full body of the beer is creamy and smooth on the palate.  This is another excellend Hair of the Dog brew.  This was a 2005 bottle and it was very tasty, but I think it will continue to get even better with over the next couple of years...

3047,"2008-02-20",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2008 Vintage 2007.  Pours beautifully to a deep garnet brown and crimson hue, muddy and glowing.  A bitter blast of Washington hops wraps the initial aroma in grapefruit zest, peach, and pine sap.  In succession a warm blanket of vanilla, caramelized sugar, and crème brulee gently enfolds the harsher elements in flawless simulation of age.  Tastes of golden raisins, melted toffee and cream, maple syrup; hints of bitter, well steeped black tea and plums provide some earthy nuance to the dominant dimension of malt.  Some bourbon in its vanilla and coconut distinctions.  While swallowing, an acidic explosion of orange juice and pineapple coats the mouth and throat with bright, tropical sweetness; palate is smooth and velvety, but retains a lively kick of hoppy aggression, finishing with a close to cloying exchange of grainy spirits and citrus juice.  Very well balanced; alcohol is almost completely hidden.  Definitely ripe for aging.  Thanks Jason! 8/4/8/4/15 3.9  

Vintage 2005.  Pours firey reddened brown with heavy particles settling toward the bottom.  Aroma of still glowing pacific northwest hops in peach cobbler and zesty mandarin orange.  Bitterness settled and soft.  Burly, barbecued sweetness of toffee and tangy meat; some vinegar, some plum.  Flavor is chunky and vibrant, laying on the palate a perfectly balanced, monstrous weight of gingerbread cookies, orange zest, raisin, and vanilla.  Carpet and mildew qualities linger around the outer limits somewhat uncomfortably.  Pineapple and maple syrup singing cheerfully and still youthfully to some extent.  Floral hints amidst a very dark, brusque and earthy mid palate rubbed lightly with alcohol.  Palate is soft, textured, with sparkling carbonation that wilts in a warm syrup while swallowing; beautifully aged.  Alcohol, some bubblegum, ripe tannic bitterness and dark honey in a long, warming finish.

2010 Vintage
12 oz bottle purchased at Texas Liquor in Carlsbad, California.  The pour is a hazed golden orange ruby with a three inch light tan head which is very lasting.  When it eventually falls, pretty sheets of lace are left behind.  Some nice tiny bubbles intermittently rise to the surface.  The aroma is toasty malt, rounded caramel honey, and a delicate grassy hop. Aromas all nicely melded, with a focus on the soft approachable honey.  Some resinous earthiness is here too. The taste is the malt, caramel and honey sweetness, along with the dry earthy cracker. The bitterness and grassiness picks up the finish, which is dry and warming. As with the nose, nice integration of flavors, though nothing nearly as transcendent as when this beer has age. The palate is medium to heavy bodied, un-filtered mouth feel, coats the mouth initially then dries out nicely. This beer as always such a treat. (8,4,8,4,17 - 4.1)

mostly clear brown orange with only a thin off-white head clinging to
the edges of the glass.  Aroma of a lot of citrus and pine hops, with
a bit of sweet malt in the background.  Almost an IPA / DIPA nose.
Taste is great, orange citrus hop, rounded caramel sweetness and a

present in the finish.  (8,4,9,5,17 - 4.3)

12 oz. bottle, from MrBendo.  Pour is a murky brownish with only a
very small tan head.  Aroma of huge, soft, wonderful (perfect) caramel
malt.  Some dried fruit is present as well.  Truly the perfect nose.
Taste is layers upon layers of complexity caramel malt, dried fig
fruitiness, earthy spiciness, even some char character all meld and
swirl in the taste.  There was a touch of oxidization, though it
detracted only slightly from an incredible beer.  Perfect body.
Almost a scotch finish.  Todd, a million thanks for this one - you are
an incredibly kind RBian. (10,4,9,5,19 - 4.7)  I will use this

The fluid is viscous initially ushering in citrus and pine hops that are mild and muted along with stewed fruits like plums, figs, raisins, prunes, cherries and dates.

Uh-oh.  Pours just about still, just a little ring of foam that surprisingly leave some trace of lacing.  Aroma is big stupid bunches of malt, just a little hint of piney hops.  Flavor is very sweet, sweeter than I remember this being in past years (2002 maybe?), almost candylike with just a hint of hop bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel is a bit off due to the lack of carbonation, but still a solid barleywine.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","mtoast"
3047,"2007-10-09",4.1,"12 oz. bottle, 2006 vintage.  Rich aroma of toffee and brown sugar, dark and sweet, some licorice notes along with suggestions of aged wood, dried herbs and flowers, some light golden raisin, orange citrus and faint alcohol as well.  Medium red-orange color, very lightly hazy, doesnt generate much in the way of a head.  Flavor is hugely malty and sweet, this tempered well by the hop spice and leafy herbal character, along with peppery bitterness and  spicy alcohol, these melding with a pleasant dried fruit (raisin, date) character and hints of anise.  Smooth, thick, warming mouthfeel, lightly syrupy, body is massively full.  Lingering hints of citrus (orange, pineapple), lacking much in the way of detectable alcohol in the flavor profile.  Nicely balanced for such a huge beer.  Tasty stuff, makes for an incredible nightcap.  Almost candyish at times after considerable warming, but the hop flavors come through a bit more strongly as well, very late.  Really good.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

3047,"2007-08-31",3.7,"2006 Bottle, purchased at Bottle Barn in Santa Rosa. The bottle opens with a barely noticeable ""pfft"" and looks flat pouring into the glass - no head and it ends with a faint, white ring around the perimeter of the glass. Dark, fiery copper which would be clear if it were not for some of the yeast sediment pouring in (theres a lot of sediment at the bottom of the bottle). Really nice (and surprisingly fresh) simcoe/amarillo tropical fruity hop nose with a little honey.. Flavor starts off with sweet caramel/toffee, honey, a little raisin and a slight tinge of vanilla. Next comes notes of pine, peach, apricot and mango hop character. The alcohol is present but pretty smooth, in my opinion.  The body is medium and syrupy with very very slight carbonation - the only part of the beer that wasnt really satisfying - it would have been nice to have a little more carbonation pushing this flavor orgy forward - It looks like I got one of those under-carbonated bottles others have mentioned. Still, a pleasurable drinking experience.","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"
3047,"2007-08-30",3.1,"12 oz bottle. Pours a very cloudy brown - kind of like dark caramel. The bottle made very little hiss when opened and poured like it was practically flat - several big bubbles, but no real head. Swirling the glass doesnt raise any bubbles either. The aroma is very, very sweet - but lovely and nuanced nevertheless. It smells like fruit (raisins, figs), a little spice (like a very subtle touch of nutmeg and cardamom), floral -almost perfumy- hops, alcohol, and loads of sweet malts (tons of brown sugar and caramel). The flavor starts with a touch of ethanol and lots of maltiness: molasses and caramel. The middle of the tongue picks up hints of fruit, yeast, and spice (like a glazed cinnamon bun with candied dates). The finish has a touch of fruity and bitter hops, but is predominantly malts. The mouthfeel is actually not that unpleasant considering it tastes completely flat. Crazy big brews like this can sometimes stand up to a lack of carbonation. But it is still thick and syrupy on the tongue. Overall, it isnt bad - but the Fred was better. Maybe I just got a bad bottle that didnt seal in the carbonation properly...","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

3047,"2007-06-16",4.2,"2004 vintage poured into a Dogfish Head oversize snifter (love this thing). Looks like an english barley reminiscent of Thomas Hardys. Cloudy, musty, earthy feel reminding of dirty water. Completely opaque and dark russet in color. Head of is white small, fades quickly and leaves bubbly lava traces abroad.

Huge delicous nose also with a TH feel. (Alright). Toffee malt aromas ooze from the snifter, thick and creamy of molten toffee to be exact, like at a candy factory or a world of sweets. Although the aromas arent overly sweet they are pleasant. bursting with dried fruits led by smyrna fig, golden raisin, mollasses, maple, hints of caramel, cherry, Very little in way of alcohol aroma. This is one sexy smelling BW.

This is my kind of beer. The finish on this is unbelievable and makes it very difficult not to keep sipping. Its like a milk chocolate covered toffee candy. Thick, chewy, somewhat rugged mouthfeel but its very nice. Basically the same flavors as what was described as in the nose but with more of a brown sugar taste than the mollasses.

Pours a very hazy amber, with a very thick two finger head, that even after 15 minutes only fades to about a fingers worth of foam. The lacing is just one solid sheet of foam on the inside of my glass.

Smell; (once the foam settle enough) even after a year and a half hops are still very evident in the aroma, with some pine and citrus. Rich caramel and chocolate, with a mils touch of cherries. Theres also a little vanilla and honey in the nose as well.

Taste; the piney and citric hops are present in the flavor, but theyre a little more mellow than they were in the nose. Vanilla, honey and some hints of cinnamon wrap around caramel and chocolate covered apples. The finish has a bit of spiciness that I really like, and where the hell is that 10.5% abv? Oh wait, there it is, i cant read the clock across the room anymore.

Mouthfeel is full bodied and very creamy, with a dangerously high drinkability. As a matter os fact, the only thing that really hurts this one for me is the ABV. If I had more than one of these, I dont think Id be able to walk straight, if at all.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

Aroma is very sweet and fruity, syrupy, typical barley wine smell.  Sweetness is a little cloying.  Very thick mouthfeel.  Taste is very sweet and first with a bitter finish.  I am not a huge fan of BWs this sweet.  I prefer Fred over this.  This is a good beer for people who like this style but its not really my thing.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Totally awesome beer.","","brstp"
3047,"2007-03-23",4.1,"Oh yeah.  This here is what Im talking about, fool!  A delicious, nearly perfect barley wine.  Sticky sweet and syrupy, yet smooth as fine oriental silk.  Fortunately, you cant really make a session out of these without injury or arrest, so thats good.  Id have gone higher on the overall, but since this was part of the Death Metal Beer Tasting Festival, things are a little foggy.

Nice flavors of honey and toffee malt sweetness, with a hint of smoke.  The finish is outstanding, and although it is two years old the hops still dry out the sweet very well and make the finish last.

3047,"2007-03-02",4.0,"Badly capped bottle, which reduced carbonation to near nothing (ironically, Adam was not affected by its off-kilter cap).  I didnt pour in the last ounce or so, cause that sludge looked nasty to drink.  Aroma is superb, very sweet, but also incredibly earthy to match.  Molasses, butter, wood, brown sugar, caramel, and a little tingly pine.  Some pancakes too.  Tastes quite rummy, with some molasses, raisins and prunes, almonds.  Brown sugar, but not TOO sweet.  Finishes with a dry wood flavor and med. bitterness, and some butterscotch.  Good hop flavor, but not over the top.  The beers body is quite thick and although it tastes quite sweet, its not cloying.  Anyway, this is great blend of high non-cloying sweet flavors and profoundly earthy spin on your expected dried/dark fruit flavors.  Hops are tasty, but not overstated.  This beer COULD be extremely wonderful, with that carbonation.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

3047,"2007-02-28",3.4,"12 oz. bottle from asteele8 , dated 2006. Unfortunately, it seems that htis was among the bottles with ""caping difficulties.""  Pour was a clear deep amber with absolutely no head or carbonation. There is a wonderfully fruity aroma, cherries, raisins, and other dark fruits, followed by spruce and citrus. Medium body with a mildy resinous character, but the lack of carbonation detracts. Rich malty sweetness is blancec by a tangy bitrus peel bitterness. The flavor and aroma certainly does not seem to have beenadversely affected by the capping problem and lack of carbonation. Were it not for that, I weould have rated this higher. Ill need ot get another example to re-rate, either a 2007, or a pre 2006.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"

Aroma is moslty new american hops like simcoe and amarillo- lots of grapefruit, citrus, orange peel, some mango, but gets to be a little catty, and solvent-like when fresh, when aged though it loses some of the harsh hop character and smooths out nicely.  Tons of hops in the flavor with more simcoe to dominate but also has a ton of malt backbone, toffee, and moslty caramel malts.  Fruity flavors in the middle, apple, dark dried figs, and finishes with a nice rouded bitterness.  The 04 destroys the 05 though.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

Ive been saving this for a while, and I have a 04 bottle that I may very well age another year to see if it tastes like this bad boy.  Upon opening the bottle the aroma came right out and greeted me like a fruit beer or a big double IPA does, just with a different smell.  Pours cloudy dirty red with orange hues.  There is a thin parshly bubbly white head that is ends up like a big rignt.  The aroma is nice and full with notes of dried fruit, smell like I expect a BW to smell.  Taste is sweet with a large hoppyness in the forefront, it is a little hoppier than I usually prefer but this is certainly a solid brew, the alchol is well hidden and the mouth feel is quite nice.

The taste was pretty sweet up front, with the dark fruits and some toffee prevailing at first, followed by alcohol, and finishing with subtle hops. The mouthfeel was rather smooth and there wasnt all that much carbonation. I definitely think the age on this bottle has mellowed the hops quite a bit, which is fine by me. Despite the alcohol being pretty evident here, I enjoyed this barleywine quite a bit, more than the Old Horizontal anyway.  A quality barley wine in my book.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"

At first I was afraid I was drinking this too early, but the hops are right where I like them, luckily.  Moderate bitterness with moderate sweetness playing tug-o-war throughout.  Earthy semidry finish.  Burps pine.  Moderate carbonation with a full body.  Alcohol is warming in the back of the throat.

Light to caramel malt with an orangy herbal sweetness coming from the hops presumably.  The mouthfeel is smooth and a s viscous as I expect a barleywine to be, with some light alcohol warming.  The flavor is nice, though not the kick in the mouth I like from barleywines. Sweet malt, but nicely rounded out, and certainly not cloying.  Theres balance from herbal hops (almost minty?) and some floral bits and a healthy dose of alcohol.  Theres a hint of orange to tangerine in the finish, and the aftertaste follows similarly, though perhaps being a bit more tart.

3047,"2006-10-31",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2006 Bottle of 03 batch sent by Kramer17801 in a trade. Pours opaque brown with a small fading tan head. The aroma is very rich, I can smell it while Im pouring. A closer sniff reveals gingerbread, molasses, bark. The mouthfeel is thick and coating, this is not all that sweet. Notes of hickory, walnuts, tiny hints of cedar and pine, make up the big flavor. This finishes bittersweet, like baking chocolate with a plethora of dark spiced flavors. The alcohol is warming, but not that noticeable in the actual flavor profile. Great example of the style, Im eager to try the fresher batch and see how that measures up. (Nov 5, 06) Bottle of the 04: This batch is 11.5%. Pours the same, nice and dense with a firm head and a sturdy brown hue. The lacing is thick. Comparing this glass to my review of the 03 I think this one is a bit sweeter. It has a touch of vanilla and caramel sweetness with plenty of earthy notes. Theres a nice spiced finish. The alcohol is again completely hidden. A few brighter notes exist in this bottle, I can pick up touches of pine wood here and there.

3047,"2006-10-19",4.3,"12 oz bottle, 2004 vintage, consumed Oct. 2006.  Pours a deep garnet red colored body under a firm creamy one inch beige head that lasted forever.  Moderate yeast sediment in bottle.  Aroma is quite pungent and balanced between resiny hops and syrupy toffee malt.  Some alcohol, candy sweetness, yeast, and minerals.  Flavor has aged beautifully.  Still quite bitter but not as in your face as fresh.  Resiny and piney up front fading to light syrupy toffee maltiness with alcohol and light papery and soy oxidation notes.  Mouthfeel is thick and full bodied but not cloying at all.  Beautiful super soft fine carbonation.  Finishes slightly sticky.  Almost three years and this is aging wonderfully.  I love it fresh, 1 year old, 3 years old, doesnt matter.  A very solid beer and a personal benchmark for the style.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Great brew that after a year still tasted so fresh. Cheers!

Big lasting head but it allows a gentle pour to fill the glass. Orange tinted brown liquid. Intoxicating peppery hop aroma with some alcohol.  The hops dominate the flavour profile overpowering all else. Not delicate, almost a dry pepper-beer. Some fruit tries to come out but gets worn down by the hops.

This is truly one of the most beautiful beers I have had the privilege of drinking. Sitting in my little Spaten mug this beer displays a spectrum of color running from the edge of the glass to the center. On the outside, its gold, then a glowing burgundy and finally a dark brown in the middle. Truly a wonder to behold. The head is slightly golden and mildly persistent. 

The smell is primarily big barley, a bit of alcohol and a well fitting citrus orange. Very nice. 

The flavor is extremely dynamic and surprisingly dry like a stout but the citrus flavor is still there with a great warming from the alcohol in the finish. The malt flavor starts out strong in the beginning, but then gives way to the dryness and citrus. Very fun to drink and just sit back to watch all the flavors wiz by. 

The mouth feel is a bit thin for my liking but I think that it augments the varieties of flavor quite well. I dont think the flavor would be as dynamic if it was any thicker. Even the carbonation seems well paired with the flavor. 

This is an awesome beer. Highly recommended.

P.S. Finished off the decanted bottle out of principle and the yeast added a smooth nutty taste, much like a Belgian. Didnt expect that.","South Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","DTB"

3047,"2006-08-25",3.9,"04 bottle from notalush via beer swap.  Actually not quite as hoppy as I was expecting.  They certainly are there, but the malt covers us the majority of the hop flavor.  There is certainly a good bit of bitterness left over.  Harsh, strong bitterness all over the back of the mouth.  Otherwise, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, oak and vanilla.  Prunes and dates.  Buttery, smooth palate.  Lots of alcohol at times, leaving it very hot.  I only get excited about a barley wine when its hoppy as hell, and this one comes close.

The flavor is ultra spicy: ginger, nutmeg, a ton of anise, licorice, tangerine. There are some ambient wood tones, too. The finish shows alcohol and smoke, and the aftertaste is more spice and crackers. There is a ridiculous amount of yeast sediment in the bottle... I poured it in eventually and dont recommend it.

Apricots, oranges and mangos - slight alcohol brashness and dirty, earthy yeastiness comes through as well.  The body is thick and sweet - with a continued display of hop juiciness.  A heavy dosing of caramel malts build a great backbone to carry the hops.  Overall, this comes off a bit too sweet and clunky for me, but maybe some time will improve things.

Huge light tan head with big bubbles and staying power. The aroma was full of orange, grapefruit, floral hops, pine and a slight bit of leather and band-aid.

A crisp, sprightly hop textured with a little coarseness, smooth medium bodied mouth feel, good sipping drinkability.

Big hoppy taste, pine needles and spruce, mild citric that compliments the herbal flavors, bitter with a soft numbing of the tongue, a subtle dry yeastiness, a submerged honey and sweet malts that rests beneath the hops during the entire taste, and a hop resinous finish.

Medium bitterness quickly gets pushed aside by the sweet caramel malt that is being swiftly chased by those fragrant and sweet hops, just enough citrus to say ""high"" and leave with some orange notes, a creamy nuttiness ensues at the end with notes of alcohol that are far from overpowering.

The good start cant make up for the unbalanced finish.  This could have been a contender.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
3047,"2006-05-29",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 30, 2016 Fresh on tap. 2007 at Brouwers. 
Cloudy red-brown, aroma of butterscotch and rich apricot, a bit of orange. Flavor is very sweet, massive butterscotch and some candied orange rind. The mouthfeel is thick like laundry detergent, and overall this is really enjoyable. Id have called it 8/4/8/4/16=4.0. One big thing going for it is that - unlike most of the bottles Ive tried - its entirely unoxidized. Im starting to wonder if this one is actually at its best when fresh.
2 years old. Rather to my surprise, I recently (Sept 06) tried tthe 03 head to head against the 04  and the 04 was actually better by a margin, fuller and a bit more complex in mouthfeel without the dominant cheese notes in the 03.

3 years old. 2003 bottle sampled May 29, 2006. Pours a gorgeous toffee red-brown with a small orange-yellow head. The aroma is toffee, light orange-peel, cognac, some cheese notes, and, as a previous reviewer pointed out, caramelized carrots (!??!). The flavor comes through as caramelized orange peel, with powerful alcohol warmth mingling with a hop bite that remains strong after 3 years in the bottle. Definitely nothing hidden about the alcohol here; this thick, sticky beer tingles on the palate, augmented by the still lively carbonation. As the beer warms from cellar temperature, it comes into its own, bringing forth a rich malty body, heavy muscat wine, and anise-seed flavors.  
Undoubtably a very good beer, and one that Id like to try with even a few more years on it. Still -- and make what you will of this -- Im having a hard time getting through even this single bottle in one sitting. 8/4/8/4/15=3.9. 

4 years old. 2012 sampled Nov 29th 2016. Creamy brown cloudy pour, lovely, lovely rich tan head. (Take note, Bourbon Fred from the Wood!). Tons of caramel, aged hops but also some citrus rind bite. Amazingly delicious sipper. Brilliant barleywine easily meriting the 4.1 Ive given it. How am I possibly going to let my remaining bottles reach the magical 10 years of age (see below)? Aint gonna happen!

10 years old. 2003 sampled Dec 14th 2013.  At ten years, this one is still going strong. I was expecting over-the-hill, but not nearly. The aroma is a huge blast of aged barleywine: caramel and brown sugar and aged hops. Delicious, delicious aroma. Flavor follows, a good blend of residual sweetness with a bitter snap of nearly-burnt cookies. Very limited carbonation but it feels just right anyway; alcohol warms the throat long after each sip. Im really impressed and Im going to bump the rating up toward the 9/4/8/4/17=4.2 Id give this one today.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

3047,"2006-05-22",4.1,"Brown, with a white head. Nice whiskey/cognac aroma, with notes of an earthy hop bite. Flavor is hops up front - woodsy, mostly, with a background of sweet caramel malts.

3047,"2006-05-21",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2007 12-ounce 05 bottle. Pours a muddy brown slurry with a big head thats medium-white. The bottle geysered idly, the glass geysered relentlessly. Took easily 3 or 4 minutes of tipping, scraping, and rinsing to get the snifter full and out of the kitchen. Pale sediment and streams of tiny bubbles for ten minutes at least. Massive hopstream on the nose, very floral and earthy. Sweet malt, brown sugar, some crystal ginger, and a big blossoming hop finish thats by turns sharp, tingling, and dry. Effortlessly complex, domineering maelstrom of sludge in the glass. 
12-oz bottle of 03. Thanks, Kim! Wow, the 03 is drinking amazingly well here at the end of 07. Wood, leather, prune, great balance and complexity with commendable boldness at the same time. Lovely stuff.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
3047,"2006-05-20",4.1,"2004 bottle.  Flavor is a raging mix of malt and hops, citrusy-grapefruit flavors, brown sugar, grass, and a healthy dose of cough syrup (but not in a bad way, if that can be believed).  This is a big beer with a big ABV, and it doesnt apologize for that fact.  Now that the whole thing is almost gone its hard to tell the flavors apart, I just get a sense of syrupy sweetness and hop bite fading into an alcoholic haze.  Tasty, but nothing outrageous for the style (think Bigfoot with more edge).  All in all, a great drink.","Connecticut, USA","TrevorFloyd"

Flavor is big, some alcohol, fruity, malty, pretty much exactly what youd expect based on the aroma.  It tastes a lot like many other BWs, to be honest.  I think BW is a style that is difficult to make a stand out example of.  But this is still a good beer.  Its pretty smooth for its strength.  Enjoyed.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","temporrari"

Some dark cherries there as well..  Flavor is very sweet at first. Notes of caramel and even a touch of brown sugar before the citrus grapefruit, pineapple, and a touch of orange take over on this.

3047,"2006-04-17",3.2,"2003 Vintage enjoyed on the night of Robs barleywine tasting. Thanks for the experience. This one opened as a gusher, I think due not to improper storage, but from a lot of yeast stored in the bottle. The color and palate is very grainy, a lot of yeast is floating around. Would make a good bread starter I imagine. The nose reflects this, with yeast notes dominating, but like a good champagne, its not as obvious on the palate. Aside from the graininess, I liked the flavors quite a bit. A bit too much hops for my liking, but theres plenty of malty sweetness, lemon, grapefruit, and caramel there to match. Good stuff.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

The aroma is powerful: carmelized sugar, rasins, cocoa, cherry, and a bit of tobacco. The flavor is also quite strong, elements of coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, sugary caramel malt, oak, vanilla, peat and a bit of smoke. Everything feels pretty smoothed out, all the flavors seems to be working with each other...the oaky sugary malt comes out most in the front, while the fruit, coffee and chocolate come out more in the finish. Although this beer is quite sweet it doesnt come out overbearing over the tounge...its rich but not heavy which seems to be complemented by the  bitter and dry ending. Quite a nice beer for after dinner, with dessert, or as a night cap.  A great sipper overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"

3047,"2006-04-07",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2007 Bottled, 2005 Vintage. Native copper red colored pour with a thin layer of even, off-white head.  A pleasant flurry of yeasty sediment clouds the beer, giving it a muddy consistancy.  Strong hoppy presence is apparant in the nose, but is supplemented by honey, fresh mint leaves, juicy strawberry, english toffee, and a touch of anise upon further examination.  The texture is a bit thinner than expected; the crisp hoppiness is a bit surprising given the beers murky appearance.  The hoppy tongue splash, however, is a great palate cleanser for the flavor parade that immediately follows.  Under-ripe cherries, rye seed, raisins, and dried figs march on through.  A gin-like resin from the hops adds to it in a fashionable manner.  Some spice livens up the brew along with a peanut butter creaminess.  Final finish of hops cleanses the palate for a second time, leaving a smack of lemongrass and cayenne pepper.  Great brew; wish I had the patience and another beer to age 10 years for another tasting.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

They put joy into this barleywine with enough honey sweetness to make it compulsively sippable, and they put in plenty of hop spirit as well.  Warming of orange, pine, caramel, a touch of spice (only a touch, and a little dried fruit.  Warming alcohol.  It helped me fall asleep during the present opening.  Though initially it seemed too much for me, it was a great sipper and by the end it seemed to capture just the right notes without ever sinking into bitter negatives when it warmed.

The initial sip of the beer seems to be very heavy and spicy but after a second and then swollowing the intensity and complexity of the beer settles and yuor left with a more thin feeling in your mouth. The high alcohol content is very noticable unlike some strong beers. An unbelieveable balance by the brewer of spice and still managing to keep a great flavor without over powering the entire beer.

Initially I wasnt liking it as much as the Fred, which I was the beer I had previously had that evening. Therefore, at first I was hoping for a little more. As it warmed it improved.

Wonderful aroma of big fresh citrus hops followed by sweet malt, alcohol and dark fruit. I love the smell! The flavour (one word: DELICIOUS!) also starts big with the hops then a sweet fruity taste follows and finally some malt, sugar, spices and smoke. The alcohol is warming and just right for a 10.5% beer. This beer is so complex and definitely one of the best Barley Wines Ive ever had the pleasure of having.

Sweet and laced thoughout with chocolate, berry tart, butter, raisins, cake and wood. Sour milk. Big and bold. Unfortunately I had the bottom of the bottle which had some rather large tobacco sized sediment. None the less the flavours of whiskey and toasted barley prevailed. Quite delicious and I wait for a sample, somewhere near the middle.","Southampton, Ontario, CANADA","Crockett"
3047,"2005-12-04",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2009 2004 On tap at Barley Johns. Extremely soup murky red, like a glowing early morn Northern California fog. Wow, wicked aroma. Incredible bright fruit wicks, with mellow west coast-esque hops jumping with lime zest, fresh orange and a touch of lemongrass. This all mingles with some rounded fruit notes, including fruitcake and mellow brandy and figs. The aroma is wholly unrestrained. Flavor is equally astounding, with a symphonic three phase series. It starts with a shallow resiny grass hop a la IPA, but then gracefully morphs into a rich, sweet candied fruit movement with pears, apples and a touch of hazlenut. Finally, it crescendos into a credibly creamy run, with figments of vanilla and creme fraiche. Palate lingers of resin, pine and floral, all fresh off the tree. Completing this symphony full circle.  This has got to be one of the most amazingly rounded barleywines Ive ever savored. Whole, deep, complex, exhilirating and inspiring. Im holding back from a 5, only because the hops come on a little strong in the palate and it could use some more spice and heavy malt sweetness.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

3047,"2005-05-29",4.4,"2004 bottle: Pours a wonderful rusty hue with a small but lasting beige head and outstanding lace. The aroma has overtones of piney and floral hops, bready malts, grapefruit and orange rind, woody and peaty esters, and a hint of aromatic pipe tobacco. The taste starts as expected with a heavy handed dose of bitters (taste really fresh versus many barley wines) and equally large biscuity malts. Sugary and fruity tones add depth of palate.  The finish is ripe with clove and pepper and some notes of peat. The palate feel is about perfect, sticky and aggressive with becoming over-the-top. The alcohol is warming indeed but is part of the experiance not a dominate factor. I agree after the fact with Cornfield that this is closer to an IIPA or at least an American Strong than Barley Wine, but see it aging into a worldly classic brew. I will say I am blown away by this, shock and awe doesnt begin to announce my feelings at this point. GET YA SOME!","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

3047,"2005-05-09",4.0,"This is a hopheads kind of a barley wine.  It pours a hazy brown color with an explosive tan head that caused me to loose some of this excellent beverage to spillage.  The aroma has a solid base of caramel malt, but thats soon buried under intense pine, herbal, and grapefruit hop scents.  The caramel insists on intruding on the flavor, but the hops again dominate, making this perhaps a tad too one-dimensional, but so full of the hop bitterness (and the sturdy ABV) that I enjoy.  Id like to get some more to cellar, but I almost fear to do so, knowing that it will gain character at the expensive of this marvelous hopfest.  This is more like a BIG IIPA than a barley wine... at least at this stage of its life.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"

Give it a swirl here and there and it will last all night.  Very luxurious.  Aroma is like hot melted caramel with some added butter.  A slight bit of boysenberry and grape juice can also be detected.  It envelopes the mouth with a creamy, yet grainy feel.    Figgy/plum flavor base with a myriad of supporting nuances.  Buttery toast with sugar, leaf, caramel, and a bakers chocolate-like flavor that is hard to describe.  Leaves a long lasting grainy, malty coating feel all over the mouth.

3047,"2005-04-26",4.3,"Crimson in color. Hallmark mountainous foam condenses to a meringue consistency. Enticing bouquet of fresh pine, mandarin oranges, and bready malts. Replete with plasticy phenols and sugared-strawberry esters. Brisk, expansive carbonation with a texture of suede. Immediately peppery with plasticy phenols. Secondarily bready, with a brash hop underlay segmenting the slippery fruitiness. Sweet brandy flavor steadily builds, which, along with the overripe grapefruit flavor, overpowers the extremely bright, albeit short-lived, resinous hop burst. Dab of grainy toast cuts some of the syrupiness. Finishes cleanly-dry with alcohol and deceptively hoppy, as well, with citrus rind bitterness slicing its way through the clingy sweetness. Burps produce chlorine-accented phenols and piney hop flavors. An expectedly-unique take on the style from HotD, but this wont bode well in the cellar, due to the feisty phenolic airiness. Which is a shame, as this [batch] was to die-for only a few months back. Based on potential, this is phenomenal.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

The head reduces to a 1/4"" thick dense layer buoyed by fine, constant carbonation.  Very hoppy aroma - its trying to be piney and grapefruity but its well-tempered by the big caramel/butterscotch malts.  This is a b-wine where the hops take over the malt.  The sappy grapefruit/herbal hops are balled up in a sticky caramel coating but theyre still the beers core.  Theres a strong retronasal alcohol component, but its not as strong in the flavor.

So I was pleasantly surprised that this beer has drastically improved on my last bottle.  It has a very hoppy aroma, with a very dark copper color to it.  Flavor wise, I would say that its not really a barleywine style tasting beer.  Its like a cross between an IPA and a barleywine.    Which is how Im going to rate this.

3047,"2004-12-09",4.3,"2004 draught @ Redbones, 12/2004.  Brilliant appearance! Deep ambers, bright oranges, soft yellows and light mahogany all swirl about in a heavily transluscent sea of viscous liquid.  Large, creamy, sticky, lasting beige head.  Not only does it leave behind sheets of sticky lacing, but the liquid itself coats the glass and is slow to let go.  Aroma showcases a moderate yeastiness (lightly musty earthy tones) a good dose of residual sugars, and plenty of sweet brown malts.  Lots of chocolate, prunes, light wininess and perhaps a touch of wood-like smoke.  Hops are quite restrained on the nose, with just a touch of bittersweet notes coming through.  Flavor begins with a huge caramel-toffee sweetness.  Heavy cream, meets milk chocolate.  Lightly bitter hops notes dance on the palate through the middle of the body and then come alive on the end, providing a soily, fresh and moderately spicy hops finish.  Simcoe hops add some juicy bittersweetness.  Notes of pine sap mix in with the caramel and chocolate.  Some deep, overripe fruit notes make themselves known as well in the middle.  Candied orange, dry plum, and faint notes of dark berries mixed with an oily, lightly dry roast.  This beer seems to have it all, in some form or another.  It certainly is a sensory rollercoaster.  The hops bitterness on the end seems to be a bit disjoined from the heavy sweetness up front, but this is no doubt due to the extreme youth of this beer.  Moving on to the body, it is quite simple to describe: Full, creamy, viscous, thick and chewy.   I would be lying if I said the extra full, chewy body didnt remind me, at least for a brief moment, of Dark Lord.  Its huge, powerful and very sweet, but highly flavorful.  Certainly this beer will even out over the next year or so.  Alcohol is also well masked, making only somewhat of a presence after the beer has warmed, and then, only on the very end.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Cinnamon and after a bit there is a touch of woodiness there. The flavors are surprisingly balanced. The malts come in pretty heavy but bitter and piney hops push it back into place. There is a bit of a sourness going on about and along with the heavy malts, which are comprised of caramel and roast, there seems to be almost a vinous quality. The dark fruits from the aromas are there, but not as prevelent. Thick beer, a film coats the mouth and lips where it touched.

No lie....I targeted them immediately so I could find a reason to complain to my shipper.   What a surprise.  Gorgeous sweet malty aroma, with cookie dough, caramel, vanilla, chocolate, and brown sugar. Also some notes of spice, wood, and I definitely get a hoppy aroma, but it isn’t really piney or floral as I come to expect from hops. More of a vinous, herbal character is exhibited. Flavour is also delicious, immediately you are hit by the huge malty character, molasses, soy sauce, dark fruits, which is then followed by spice, some herbal/medicinal hops and an very long, warming, finish. Enough bitterness to let you know it’s there, but definitely isn’t overpowering.  A very good ale, definitely undervalued.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"

Aroma is very lovely.  Menthol??  Flavor is minty, sweet, bitter bitter but very smooth.  Incredibly complex and full body.  Burn and bitter hops with richness that lingers.  Finish is surprisingly smooth and no less complex.  Just a terrific brew all-around, and I was surprised to find that it wasnt more highly-regarded on the site.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
3047,"2004-10-04",4.5,"Ruby Brown.

Quite fragrant in its bouquet. Odd, difficult to describe, with notes of dried herbs, cinnamon, rotting red apple, hot sauce and peppers.

The hops are enormous in this barley wine. They dont really come into play until the mid-palate, but when they do huge flavors of pine, lemon, wood and herbs come about, along with an incredible, overpowering bitterness. The malts are full of caramel and sweet sugar glazed dark fruits. Daunting, griping, textured, full body.

Just an incredible beer.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"

Alcohol is indeed more apparent than in the 2002 version in mouth, but its barley-wine ish all the way. Flavors of plums, orange, mint, pine, cookies, mango...Yeasty feel, good balance despite the ridiculously high sweetness: theres enough acidity and bitterness to counter it. Medium body, lively carbonation for the style. Lovely and complex nightcap. A bruiser of a brew.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
3047,"2004-09-14",3.4,"Lightly cloudy dark copper color with a small dense creamy head. Heavy aromas of caramel, hazelnuts, alcohol and old pine sap. This is one of those brews that Ive been wanting to try, but have not actively sought. Finally found on my trip to Seattle this summer and enjoyed today on this fine hot Indian summer day. I really should have waited until the snow storm. This really reminds me of another barley wine brewed farther south on the west coast. Heavy sweet over ripe fruit mingle and ferment to add to the alcohol. Fortified wine comes to mind. Apples and mild acid in the finish. Strong and foreboding. Give me an Adam anytime. Burn is now noticeable on the tongue and throat stomach is warming. Spontaneous combustion may not be a myth. Damn, even my nose is running.  In the terms of Gusler, this sure is a Hoot!","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
3047,"2004-09-11",4.1,"Clear, brilliant copper body with a thick, tight tan head.  Big, sweet nose with a lot of herbacious hops in the nose.  Sweet caramel, fresh herbs, warm alcohol, sticky toffee, a touch of pine, sour apples and bits of grapefruit pulp.  Maybe a very light touch of smoked or roasted malt.  The body is fairly full with a bit sharp carbonation.  The flavor is quite reminiscent of the nose, with a nice balance of sweet malt and strong, bitter hops.  The malt is quite strong and sweet and definitely holds up to the liberal hopping.  I like the strength of the malt because it doesnt let the hops become overbearing.  The finish is long and warming with a nice, crisp bitterness.  An excellent offering from HOTD.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
3047,"2004-09-01",4.2,"This is still a great brew that will continute to be even greater 5 or 6 years from now, although I have to say I enjoyed the previous vintage a little bit more, this is still going to rank in as one of my favorite barleywines of all time.  A deep hazy amber color, that hades into a deep rich brown color with little to no head.  A big hop aroma just a before, with a huge malt character, this one has a little bit more of a peaty chocolate taste than I remember, and slightly nutty, like a scottish or english strong ale would have.  Excellent!","Tacoma, Washington, USA","harlequinn"
3047,"2004-08-30",5.0,"UPDATED: NOV 30, 2004 2004 Just when i thought this brew couldnt get any better the 2004 vintage is released. Not only is this brew absolutely amazing now, this thing could be aged for an even better taste, if thats even imaginable. Incredible hop aroma just attacks you as you open the bottle, must be all those dryhopped simcoes or something, there is also some nice spices and a faint fruitiness. The added hops to this years batch just really added to the taste and I will have to pick up more of these brews to cellar for a while.

2003 This brew is truely amazing. A dark red/brown color with a nice tan head that leaves decent lacing. The aroma is very well balanced with some sweet caramel malt and a nice light hop backing to it. Flavor has tons of roasty malts, caramel and almost a faint smokiness in the after taste. By far my favorite NW xmas brew.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
3047,"2004-08-28",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2012 2005 - fresh
When properly poured its clear dark orange and cedar colored.  Extremely strong bouquet of grassy fresh hops and tree sap.   Sweeter malt nose than previous years.  More of a homebrew funky malt flavor, almost a little spoiled... very different from 2003 and 2004 - which I prefer largely over the 2005.  


2004 - fresh
Murky dark brown and copper with a large fluffy tan head.  Very sharp malt nose with pine, tree bark, sap, caramel, loads of honey, and a some hops.  Very roasty flavor and a toasted bread and nut note that stands out... along with some hazelnuts and some birch.  Really, really fantastic... this is an amazing beer, even this young. I have an 03 and an 04 saved, and I cant wait to see how they behave in the cellar.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3047,"2004-08-12",3.8,"2003 EDITION: I wanted to hold on to this a bit longer, but the bull dog on the bottle barked and growled to be opened! Sharp and peppery aroma. Some molasses and toast in the nose. Strong flavors for sure. Alcohol, molasses, raisins and cherries. The strength of the alcohol is at every sip. Powerful brew indeed. I still like adam better, but this is a clearly well made barley wine. Much more complex as it warms up. This dog wants you to relax and enjoy.","Oregon, USA","brewshthereen"
3047,"2004-08-05",3.5,"2003 vintage bottle: This has a pretty sweet, floral aroma with definite bread and cookie involved, and a very slight sour milk smell that actually blends pretty well; the flavor is bitter all the way through, with a quick, sweet and tart, phenolic background, and a sharp, spicy, herbal hopping; the palate is a tad astringent after a bit; overall, its quite a nice, complex brew with a beautiful hop profile and adequate balance.","Boise, Idaho, USA","ontario102"
3047,"2004-07-19",4.1,"Bottle pours a rich cloudy caramel, fine bits float about, large fluffy light tannish head, with fairly sticky lacing.   Aroma is of sweet caramel, light hops, a bit of fig/date, with emerging alcohol as it warms.   Flavor doesnt show off the caramel, but I do pick up orange peel or grapefruit rind, slightly bready, with a nice hop bitterness.   Fairly thick mouthfeel, smooth palate, goes down rather easy too at 11.5%.   Finishes with a lingering hop bitterness, slightly sweet, slightly malty, but surprisingly no alcohol.   This is one killer Winter offering...

3047,"2004-07-15",3.7,"This was nice.  It came from a  trade and the cap had shifted in the box.  I lost about half the bottle, but squashed the cap on with tape and stuck it in the fridge.  Over 24 hours later, no noticeable oxidation, and adequate carbonation, so here goes: Nose: very earthy, bitterish, metallic, herbal, maybe juniper?  Not TOO appealing but not offputting.  Hints of malt are there too.  Appearance: Thick murky brown, nice head.  Not overcarbonated, most likely b/c of the cap mishap.  Taste: Malts underlied with much hoppy flavor.  Bitter, herbal, ashy, slightly unbalanced, alcohol is noticeable even when warm.  There is a skunk outside my open window.  Goes straight to my head.  The alcohol, not the skunk.  Pretty good, but I gotta say I prefer Adam.  THANK YOU INDIANA_RED!!","Pennsylvania, USA","Probiere"

Aroma:  very spicy, malty, cinnamon, woodiness, minerals, strong alcohol scent, and bark

Flavor:  strong cream flavor, slight chocolate, and coffee (like an Irish cream coffee flavor), sharp spiciness--like ginger snaps, strong alcohol flavor, and brown sugar

Palate:  very smooth and creamy, slight burning aftertaste--from combination of alcohol and strong spiciness.  Really thick, coating the inside of the mouth.  Lots of body and character.

3047,"2004-05-30",3.6,"2003 bottling.  Has much the same aroma as Adam- herbal, spicy hops, raisin, caramel, and pineapple juice.  The body is deep red, topped by a dense, large light tan head (which leaves awesome lacing).  The beer starts with a promising caramel and raisin malt character with increasing sweetness until the ethanol and intense hops erode its more pleasant characteristics.  The finish is too bitter and astringent for my tastes.  Highly carbonated (like all HotD beers)- how do they manage to make such ""heavy"" beers with such smooth bodies?  This is a mixed bag because of its fatal Simcoe and Amarillo flaw.  The transition from tart malt to bitter, astringent hops needs to be tightened.  Otherwise this would rate into the 4s.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

3047,"2004-02-16",4.0,"2003 Vintage (fresh): Dark ruby mahogany color with a tinge of tawny. Light hazy color with a small off-white head with medium to low carbonation but good for the style. The aroma is loaded with hops, the best kinds too. Amarillo and simcoe, god damn that's a good combo. They blend together with the high alcohol content and the perky crystal malts. The flavor is hard to detect because of the overall slam of the alcohol, but once your palate adjusts (and it warms) you can start to pick out some grapes (port), raisins and fig. The mouthfeel is lightly sweet and warm, zesty bite at the tail. The finishes is a little bitter with a lot of alcohol feel.
