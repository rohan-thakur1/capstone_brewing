2880,"2017-05-08",4.1,"750 mL bottle. Originally reviewed 8/29/2011. 

Crystal clear gold body with a huge white head.The head never fully dissipates and the lace sticks to the glass. Smells like a hoppy tripel. All the great hop flavors of an IPA with the complex citric fruits of a tripel. Some honey and spice flavors behind that. Belgian yeast aromas abound, as well.

Taste is a little bit of a letdown from the smell, but still good. Hoppy up front with some nice Belgian spice. Sweetness in the middle, which is a bit much. Finishes like bitter honey.
Very heavy for such an effervescent smell. By the end of the bottle, its almost syrupy and a bit hard to drink. I expected more of a dry finish at such a high ABV, but its still sweet at the end. A little drier and less sweetness and this would be spot on.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
2880,"2017-04-22",4.5,"You gotta love when you tumble on greatness. Strong taste with perfect balance, even for a strong beer.

2880,"2017-03-13",4.2,"Botella en 99 Cervezas. 
Vierte en dorado claro, brillante y perfectamente transparente. Buena carbonatación con algunos hilos de burbujas subiendo a la superficie. Abundante espuma blanca, bastante cremosa aunque de burbuja media-grande. Buena persistencia y mejor adherencia. Un aspecto realmente impresionante. 
Intensidad media-alta en nariz. Notas frutales que podrían ser de ciruela blanca y de plátano muy ténue. Suaves notas de Jazmín, así como un punto terroso y suavemente especiado, acompañado de algo de limón y hierba fresca. También, muy de base, notas leñosas y lupuladas. Buena complejidad en nariz, muy equilibrada. Lo que está absolutamente ausente es el alcohol, lo que resulta muy sorprendente en una cerveza de 10% ABV, chapeau! 
En boca, el sabor predominante es por supuesto el dulce, aunque el amargo no le va en absoluto a la zaga, lo que resulta sorprendente en una cerveza de la escuela belga (no tan sorprendente si tenemos en cuenta que está elaborada en Canadá, con la lógica influencia de la escuela americana). Conforme evoluciona en boca el dulce va cediendo paso al amargo, presentando una persistencia notable. En cada trago se repite el proceso, un inicio dulce que es enseguida barrido por un amargor ligeramente picante y muy agradable (no agresivo). Tampoco en boca se deja notar su alta graduación alcohólica. 
Es de cuerpo medio y textura como de vino espumoso y a la vez chispeante y picante. Una espuma muy fina se forma también en la lengua cada vez que damos un sorbo. Muy interesante. 
Una cerveza muy bien equilibrada y a la vez con carácter. Aspecto fantástico, deliciosa en nariz y evolución en boca más que interesante. Una cerveza que deberías probar si tienes ocasión. Sin duda.","Valencia, SPAIN","JuanCC"
2880,"2017-03-09",4.7,"750ml bottle from LCBO. 9.3% alc/vol. Pours a clear gold colour with one finger of lasting head. Lacing clinging to the side of the glass. I get tons of hoppy and fruity aromas on the nose. Notes of grapefruit, oranges, pine, and honey. Taste matches the aroma with some lemony taste. The finish is well-balanced and semi-dry from the hops. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. I think this beer is closer in style to Belgian IPA than the traditional Belgian Strong Ale. Excellent brew. This is a must-try, if youre into Belgian Strong Ales or IPAs.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","cattaneopapa"
2880,"2017-03-04",4.2,"750 ml bottle. Hazy golden colour, thick white head. Fruity aroma with sweetish malt, citrus and yeast notes, and a whiff of spices and grassy hops. The flavour is sweetish malty, with ripe fruits, citrus and banana notes, and an aromatic hoppy finish with a bit of warming alcohol. Warm spicy aftertaste. Delicious and well balanced.","Guelph, Ontario, CANADA","mikkopen"

2880,"2016-11-09",4.3,"A big pillowy, sustained white head on a yellow straw body. A fresh and engaging nose features citrus and floral hops, sweet malt and grain. This beer is a study in fresh, well balanced tastes. Understated Belgian yeast with a banana accent, lemon, pineapple and green apples, floral hops, sweet bready malt and a touch of cloves all blend well into a refreshing profile. Solid effervescence, a medium body and a slick but not cloying mouth feel are assets.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Gluepot"

2880,"2016-10-10",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2016 Bottle from LCBO: massive, creamy head that expands and lasts, and produces an excellent lace. Golden colour. The nose is grain, malt, ripe fruit, and hops with some clove, spice, and yeast. The taste is a conjured complexity of fermented pear and pineapple with a somewhat herbal character. Grains and malts make up a backbone that offers sweetness upfront and subtle bitterness in the finish. Slick mouthfeel, and a high alcohol profile that is well hidden. Robust yet pleasantly smooth and balanced. Enjoyed it with Thanksgiving fare. Exquisitely crafted ale that?s a must have for anyone?s personal reserve.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","ILduce"

2880,"2016-08-20",3.5,"Drank w Matt after Danis birthday. Creamy hazy beige, slightly dull but with a massive pillowy fluffy white head. Smells of woody bitter hop, musty yeast, moderate spicy grainy malt, fermented pear and apple, light clove. Taste is very deeply bitter, woody grassy wheat, yeasty and lightly peppery. Body is stony and bitter, frothy wet spicy grainy slightly fizzy finish. Lots of stony bitterness to complement the yeast and spicy malt. This bottle didnt taste too fresh - or just muddy flavour of the yeast?","HONG KONG","CacheManyHose"
2880,"2016-08-20",3.5,"750ml bottle (4/2016 I think) from Gatineau Broue Ha Ha at home in HK. Hazy golden pour with very big puffy dense head with lots of structure. Aroma is not that strong - maybe the beer isnt super fresh? - bitter Belgian notes. Taste is bitter, spicy, sweet grain, stone fruit - more sweet than tart. Very balanced and certainly, as others note, doesnt seem like its 10% despite the boozy finish. Not as hoppy as I expected unfortunately, and not a style I tend to enjoy, but a nicely balanced very elegantly crafted beer.","HONG KONG","HKdIPA"

Une mousse blanche maculée couronne ce riche liquide et ne sestompe que très lentement en laissant sur mon verre une dentelle des plus élaborées. Nez plutôt malté où le houblon à leuropéenne apporte fraîcheur et légèreté. Un malt caramélisé, un houblon aérien. Corps très agréable en bouche où le malt caramélisé sexprime sans retenue sans jamais écoeurer ni alourdir mon palais. Cette bière au corps indéniablement affirmé est légère et se boit dun trait, si on a le malheur doublier ses 10% dalcool.

2880,"2016-04-21",4.1,"Hazy straw color with powerful subtle activity. Super foamy white 4 finger expanding island head, lasting around 20 minutes, with strong legs.

Aromas of sweet malty grains, citrus, and a little vinous. Flavors of lemon, apple, pear, caramel, floral and herbal spices. Pleasant sweet grainy biscuity feel with a nice citrus sharpness. Balanced taste and not too boozy.

Slick medium body with perfect carbonation. Well intensified medium strength finish of short length, ending with a clean sharp citrus and slightly spicy noble hops feel.

Overall a very good craft with a super fresh taste of delicious complex flavors, while the nose is a little faint. Very easy to drink and quite treacherous.","Quebec, CANADA","Bierdimpfe"
2880,"2016-04-19",4.0,"2016/04/19 - Pours a hazy, yellow honey colour with a thick, foamy, white head that slowly reduces and leaves ample lacing. Aroma is amazing; Belgian yeast, banana, cloves, pear, tropical fruits, grass and a hint of butter (not unpleasant). Taste is cloves, doughy yeast, banana, pineapple, pear, peach, spicy hops and light alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium and silky with smooth carbonation and a finish that is slightly drying and mildly warming. I can't believe that it has taken me this long to try this beer. Exceptionally balanced while being complex and masterfully hiding the ABV.

Theres also a sub-layer of other luscious odors: honey, brioche, herbs... Incredibly complex. What about the mouthfeel? Lets see: creamy, very soft, silky and with a carbonation so soft Id describe it as velvety.

2880,"2016-01-02",3.8,"Halovány aranysárga színe fölött tömött, pöffeszkedő, hófehér hab fejlődik sebesen, világos árnyalata némi meglepetéssel is szolgál, miután elméletileg ""belgian strong ale""-ről van szó. Karakterisztikája alapján ugyanis inkább tűnik valami vadabb, élénkebb italnak, mivelhogy tripelesen csípős, gabonás, ámde IPA-szerűen komlóvezérelt jegyeket egyaránt megcsillant úgy illatában, mint ízében, mely utóbbi amellett, hogy vibráló és könnyed, telt és gazdag is egyben. Na nem az a kirobbanó, malátaszirupos jelleg, inkább a fűszeresebb, pezsgőbb hangulatú, szénsavval alaposan teletűzdelt típus, amiben a komló a szokásosnál erőteljesebben képviselteti magát, túlsúlyba azonban nem kerül, a főzet harmóniáját sem bontja meg. Ez utóbbi jellemvonás egyébként a legnagyobb erénye az italnak, letisztult ízvilág, egyszerű, de minden szempontból kielégítő a test. Almás, száraz pezsgős, kenyeres és élesztős jegyek egyaránt megcsillannak a testben, összességében változatos benyomások sorát hordozva. Ha helyénvaló is a ráragasztott kategória, annak a könnyedebb, ha úgy tetszik populárisabb verzióját szolgáltatja, ami miatt a magam részéről talán tartózkodnék az élmezőnyben elhelyezni az italt, amellett, hogy természetesen egy kiemelkedően jó főzetről van szó.","HUNGARY","adster"

2880,"2012-06-29",4.0,"The price put me off this one at first, but heck, compared to a bottle of pricey wine this is a steal. Ive been burned on expensive brews that werent worth it (hello, Innis & Gunn!), so I shied away for a while. But since this was from Quebec, I gave it a chance.
Glad I did. This is like an Orval on steroids: same dry-hopped bitterness, but taken to extreme with way more alcohol punch. Thats not a bad thing unless youre driving something besides a wheelchair. Im a Belgo-Canadian and Ive drunk most top Belgian ales, and this could stand among them. For some reason, Quebec knows how to deliver.
Way drier than other Quebecois faves like Fin du Monde, so kudos to the brewer for finding their own direction when it comes to Belgian inspiration: these guys are really on to something, and its very rare for me to say that spending $12 on a bottle of beer was worth it. It was.
Im not a snob who downgrades for the sake of it: the top ratings are there for a reason, and this beer deserves them all IMO. Not for everyone, but definitely for me.

Off that huge head, however, comes a gueuze-like Belgian blonde aroma that I have so much missed living here in the arctic with just Molson macros (mostly) to choose from. Hints of hops and caramel, dry wit citrus on the back end. Very refreshing, I could just sit here and smell this all day long, it reminds me I need to get to Brussels and its farmlands with the wild yeasts again sometime in the coming years; but anyways. The flavour is a smooth mix of hops and sugar with hints of fruits like banana in there, soft sweet caramel hints, you know theyre sweetening it up but in such a way that its not overbearing and still quite delicious.

Medium bodied (medium-full with some of the yeast poured out). carbonation is aggressive (visually) but champagne like on the tongue. Overall this beer is exceptionally balanced and well made.

2880,"2012-03-22",4.6,"750mL bottle from the Lickbow. Pours a nice gold with a huge white head. This is actually the hardest beer Ive ever had to pour, it just instantly turns into foam once it leaves the bottle. This is worse than Orval. When it settles 4 hours later, you get a huge whiff of a hop medley, with delicious pale and Belgian-esque malts underneath and some old-fashioned bubblegum. Piney, citrusy, peppermint-y, pretty much every descriptor you can imagine for hops, its in here. The flavour....wow. Its like if a Belgian strong blonde ale married a bunch of hops, and their child was one of those insanely over-achieving kids who actually has trouble not succeeding in everything they do, that kid would be this beer. I have few words to describe the ideal balance here of everything. Ive had beers at 5% abv which had more booze present in their flavour. This one has a huge, rich malty palate, balanced with a plethora of hop flavours and mild hop bitterness which lingers and bites the back of the tongue. Spicy, mildly yeasty. Unbelievable.

2880,"2012-03-02",4.4,"From notes.  First reviewed 3/14/2011.  Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. 2009 vintage. Thanks to Dunt for sharing his bottle.

Out of the bottle this pours a pleasantly cloudy golden yellow color. A huge white head with lots of fluffy lace displays great retention. 

The aroma is candy sweet pale malt with a generous helping of spicy Belgian yeast. Clove is the dominant spice, followed by a burst of floral and citrus hoppiness.

The flavor is fairly simple but incredibly well proportioned. Sweet candi and pale malt open up the palate. A pleasant but not overwhelming Belgian yeast follows, imparting flavors of clove, coriander, and orange peel. Some grapefruit and tangerine citrus combine with the spice to provide a nice hop finish. The end of each sip is clean and refreshing.

The crisp, clean carbonation is very evident and helps display the flavor characteristics well. The bubbles are soothing and complement the medium to full body well, never letting on this has a 10% ABV.

Initial effervescent tangerine flavour come through straight down the middle, followed by a thick and rich honey warmth, finishing with a pleasant nutmeg on the exhale. Fine carbonation holds all the flavours together and the 70 IBUs provide an excellent backbone and tail to complete the experience. High complexity, long length, high potency (ABV), very smooth & drinkable, high depth. A very, very solid beer with fruity sweet, and sharp bitterness, with medium spices.

Nose is very similar to Gouden Carolus Hopsinjoor: small abbey tripel banana and cloves and candi sugar with a healthy dose of grassy and sharp hops (Saaz and Amarillo come to the front). Small celery and estery yeast reminds me of Saison Dupont yeast. Taste upfront is pretty alcohol heavy with a major league banana and spice character. Very Belgian all around really puts this as almost a clone of Hopsinjoor or higher gravity Saison Dupont, ie Avec les bon Voeux. Palate is heavy, soft carbonation, slightly nutty bitter (Simcoe?).

It pours a clear amber gold with a huge foamy white head that takes a while to dissipate and leaves some nice lacing.

It smells super spicy. The yeast really is noticeable. It has a coriander and clove presence. The hops are there, they are grassy with an underlying of peach. The more you sniff it, the fruitier it becomes it seems.

The flavor dominates. It has a classic Belgian Strong Pale ale base. It is spicy and floral with a bit of bready malt. It also has a decent amount of hops. The combo of hops is exactly what I would put in an Belgian IPA, in fact it is almost the same as my hop bill in my homebrew. It has a ton of citrus, just pounding tropical citrus really, the malt sweetness really brings out the hop flavors. It has a medium to high bitterness that lingers nicely in the aftertaste.

This is exactly what I look for in a Belgian IPA, it is spicy and moderately bitter with a big fruity hop kick, though they could have dry hopped it a bit more.

An incredible, fascinating beer.  The nose is kind of earthy, spicy, slightly citrusy.  Very much a noble hop presence, though Trevor said he thought it might be skunked, I just think its a combination of Saaz and Pils malt that brings the horrors of trash euro lagers to mind.  Regardless, the beer has a ton of flavor going on, citrus and spice and a slightly funky yeast quality that really pulls everything together.  A touch high on the alcohol, which keeps it from being perfect.  With Belgian styles I tend to be more sensitive to boozy qualities.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
2880,"2011-03-08",4.3,"Large 750 mL bottle is a green glass bottle and a slight hit on the hops can be detected because of it. Aroma has a hefty earthy nose, slightly cheesy and bready presence from the Belgian yeast, a mild citrusy orange hops nose creeps in late and leans overall a bit on the sweet side. Pours in your glass a very clean, light golden color with a HUGE bubbly, white head that sticks in clumps along the side of your glass and is retained a very, very long time. The brew has a tremendous amount of carbonation that creates an almost violent cascade of bubbles in the center of your glass. The flavor is definitely one of the most complex I have had a chance to taste in a long time. Starts off with modest doughy and ester characteristics imparted by the yeast. This is quickly overtaken by the bitter, slightly spicy hops that, after the initial bitter bite, transitions to a strong lemony citrus character. After the citrus flavor is around for a second it quickly is combined with a dry, bitter, taste bud puckering feeling that carries out to the end of the tasting. Body is very crisp and extremely lively due to the large amount of carbonation. Overall a terrific beer!

2880,"2009-07-06",4.0,"From 2007.  Ok, I know its kind of a sin to be rating this hop-driven beer at this late date, but I kept saving it for occasions last summer, again and again and again, and they never happened, and then I knew it was past an acceptable point of freshness, and then put it off even more.  So here we are, all feeling awkward about this rating.

It pours a metallic yellow with a frothy pile of white.  WIldflower honey, dry grass, saaz hops aroma; peppery, dry, and lightly sweet with a cornmeal-like maltiness.  Honey is the strongest component, and sometimes its earthiness leans towards sesame seeds and sunflower seeds.  Here and there theres a little burst of apple cider vinegar.

Flavor is a calm, creamy bitterness.  Very flowery.  Alcohol is almost completely hidden.  Very tea-like in bitterness, with hints of soft green spices like sage, very much seeming like a settled-down version of its former self; theres plenty of doughy, soft yeast flavor providing a pleasant pad underneath; quiet.  I feel like I can taste the dusty, grassy bitterness of the saaz still, and even a bit of the bracing green bite of the simcoes in peppercorns and pine, but cant find much amarillo; its very green-tasting, very floral, but its definitely noticeable that its far from fresh.  Putting this aside, its herbal qualities really are pleasant, and it has an incense-like calm about it throughout; so, the feeling of it is still really nice, but the flavors very obviously indicate what it probably was a year ago when I first had it.

Yeast pour.  Couldnt hurt now I suppose.  Aroma has more vinegar, more cheese, some pit fruits, and maple syrup.  It now smells much like an egg-bake topped with honey and syrup, and I want to drink it with breakfast.  Flavor has gotten gravelly and more pillowy; weaker for details but texturally more interesting.  Man, its musky now,and full of an almost tannic, pure bitterness.

Medium-full bodied palate.  Hugely effervescent, but still soft.  Finishing flavors remind me of an orange pekoe tea, a pear skin, and a lot of mustiness.  Its good and long, but it gets less interesting as it fades, not just as if the flavor is fleeting but as if its getting worse, like when a piece of gum starts to taste like your spit.  Finally, very dry.

Its a sad thing for me to realize that this, with its punchy hop flavors, ample malt body and fulsome, bone dry yeast character  is obviously something I would have loved when it was fresh, and that Im only now drinking it and seeing how enticingly interesting it has still remained.  And procrastination has bitten me in the ass again.  Thanks for the opportunity, the man, Dany!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Wow, this one sort of came out of nowhere.  Along with thier Hibernus, these are some of the best beers coming out of Quebec.  This makes drinking beer fun again.  I can’t wait to stock up on this when it comes out again.

2880,"2008-10-08",4.0,"750ml from Glouglouburp - thanks, Dany! As a big fan of Houbolon Chouffe and Urthel Hop-It, let’s just say I was well prepared to love this beer. And it didn’t disappoint in the slightest. An absolutely massive pour, a rush of golden brew and carbonation with an abundant, sticky head that settles into a pleasant series of rocky formations. Nose is very dry, obviously well hopped but with some powerful yeast and pepper notes, which  complements the dryness of the beer. The flavor is multi-dimensional, though, with some very mild citric flavors emerging as the beer warms a bit. Malts in there for balance and a touch of sweetness, but nothing too leaden or overpowering. Basically a superlative rendition of the IIPA/Belgian hybrid.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
2880,"2008-10-02",3.7,"Bottle- Deep golden pour unleashes a beautiful frothy white cap, leaving plenty of lace. Spicy, fruity nose hints at rose petal and fresh hops, with lots of citrus and a blast of cotton candy. Smells good. I don’t really like the sweetness here, but the flavour profile is still pretty good. Sweet mango and apple with yeasty flavours lead to spices and candied malts. The hops don’t come through in the flavour the way they were calling at me in the aroma. Pretty good beer to be sure. A bit over-hyped though.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"

2880,"2008-09-20",3.8,"2007 750mL Bottle thanks to Dany! Aroma comes quickly with orange peel, marshmallow malt, and a bit of Turkish spicing. Pours a brilliany syrupy gold, with a huge pillow of slowly subsiding opalescent cloud-matter. Flavor is rich, but not particularly complex. There’s a good run of rather phenolic yeast character and alcohol, that plays towards orange, citrus, and reduced candi sugar. It’s clean and bright, a nice malt flavor. The hops come in as brisk, grassy dryness that plays off the malt and well-subdued alcohols. This is good, but I’m not sure it’s really a Top 100 beer. Clean, bright, refreshing with well-concealed alcohol, but the hops were the disappointing for me. I wanted more bristling bitterness and flavor. It seems like their character had subsided plenty.

Thanks once again to mike for opening a beer that I didn’t expect to see without working the trade circuit heavily.  This was an well made Belgian.  I don’t however see it as worthy of Top 100 inclusion.  Perhaps that is due to the difficulty in acquiring it.  Put alongside a few other more nationally available things it would not be my first choice.

Aroma / Appearance - A huge white foamy head danced to the top of my glass before succumbing to the transparent bronze body beneath.  The strong maltiness was accompanied by honey, wheat and a few varieties of hops.  In some ways it reminded me of a strong pilsener.

Flavor / Palate - The maltiness takes center stage.  Afterward comes spruce, pine and cigarette ash.  Just before the dry bitter finish are honey, lemon and dried lawn clippings.  Overall this was nice but hardly exceptional enough to merit the cost of tracking down another bottle for the cellar.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Flavors were equally perplexing, with a sweet, fairly neutral, bready malt backdrop allowing the delicate spicing and hopping to shine.  Banana, clove, hoppy grass,  and white pepper are all distinct.  The mouthfeel displays a medium-full, finely carbonated body that sports a touch of lactic creaminess.

Pours a gorgeous plume of creamy long-lasting head.  Definate aromas of all three hops involved.  I was a bit skeptical about how these would work together, but my fears were quickly put away.  Very potent esters that follow quickly behind.  Pleasant mouthfeel and body.  A very up-front sweetness on the sides of the tongue.

2880,"2008-05-02",4.1,"First off, a major thanks to glouglouburp for sending this rarity to the U.S. from Montreal. I opened this one with wetherel and Sean at the PP Bottle Shop with a few other new faces. Massive head formation upon pouring, ending up in a fluffy pillow head with substantial lacing. Bountiful carbonation throughout the clean and clear golden color. Pretty impressive aroma that I considered as this beers best display of character. Lots of coriander, fresh orange peel and yeasty biscuit tones. Also a touch of funkiness that almost suggests this is a Brettanomyces beer, but I assume its the unique contribution from Saaz hops used.  The flavor is very floral; with juniper and lavender that transitions to a strong bitter finish, like a Saison on steroids. Tingly and smooth palate with a doughy undertone. Overall, damn good for the style, like Chouffe Houblon, but I cant say its my favorite...or worthy of the Top 50 either.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"
2880,"2008-05-02",4.0,"Tried from the funky bottle that hapjydeuce brought to the bottle shop.  Lots of carbonation on first pour with a 2 finger white foamy head that fades at a medium rate.  Yellow color.  Lots of bubbles climbing the glass inside the liquid.  Phenolic Belgian triple aroma, Im not sure from what.  Possibly a combination of yeast and high brewing temperature.  My first guess was the beer was finished with Brett.  It has a nice plastic Brett aroma and it has high carbonation, meaning the Brett had eaten some complex sugars after bottling.  You can notice the Saaz hops too, even though they are not overwhelming. Easy to drink.  Heres a beer for the ""Orval should be a top 50 beer"" fans.  Im not one of those people.  Its just a good triple to me.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"

2880,"2008-04-24",5.0,"Bottle courtesy of glouglouburp.  So theres this brewer who takes one of my favorite types of hops, takes an already amazing recipe, adds said hops, then ferments it with a Belgian yeast strain that yields a funkiness that rivals Orval.  That beer is Charleioux Dominus Vobiscum Lupulus.  Pours a perfect gold with a huge white head and a generous amount of sustained bubbles.  Smells of perfume, some signature simcoe, citrus, oranges, lots of dry malt, some funky rustic saison like hints, caramel sugar, some pepper.  This seriously has one of the best noses of any beer Ive ever quaffed.  Taste lives up to the aroma nicely.  Lots of dryness, oranges, pepper, spice, light bitterness, sage, this truly runs the gambit.  Mouthfeel is tingly and combines the American hops with the saaz to perfection.

2880,"2008-02-25",4.2,"Pours pale gold with a slight chill haze. A carefull pour released a torrent of spongy, white foam.
Half the glass was lively, airy head, before a quick retreat. 
Within less than a minute there was only footprints of lace, and a coned center on the surface.
Aromatics are spicy and bristling with Belgian essense. Peppercorns, cloves, peaches, pears, melons, mint, coriander, pineapple, and wet grass leap forth. Phenolic, zesty, and earthy. Borderline medicinal.
Certainly not over-the-top hoppy, but a great balance of spice, hops, and yeasty funk.
The mouthfeel falls a bit short. The promise of a high level of carbonation doesnt follow through after the beer settles down.
Light in body, but certainly could use some additional liveliness.
The Pallet is spicy and dry. The hops are more subdued than in the nose, leaving room for plenty of zesty, peppery crispness.
Bitterness is firm and lingering, and the beer is well-attenuated with a Brett strain, no-doubt.
The beer finishes with pepper-dusted orange oil, crushed mint, clove-studded pine boughs, and warming alcohol.

The head last for an eternity, eventually subsiding into a a thin blanket, leaving ample lacing in the glass.  The carbonation is fascinating, a myriad of bubbles, seemingly rising to the surface in an unending stream.   Possibly, the best looking beer I have ever cast a gaze upon.   The aroma is a feast for the senses.   A cedar/pine aroma is the first to become evident, with a doughy/yestiness coming into focus.   Some black pepper spices along with a touch of alcohol.  Glorious.  The flavor is as complex as the aroma.  The initial attack seems to be a light spiciness, tempered by the hops, which seem to be followed by a sweet bread like note (Challah perhaps?).

2880,"2008-01-31",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 6, 2008 In short: An very hoppy very floral strong belgian blonde ale.  Original and truly excellent.
How: Very fresh at a tasting session than 750ml bottle by myself two months later.
The look: Partly cloudy dark yellow body with a rather large white head.
In long: Nose is quite something, huge amount of hops, very floral, a bit perfumy and a bit soapy.  This well malted and very yeasty Belgian Ale provide an adequate support for the hops avalanche although the malts and yeast esters do not play a big role in the overall flavour spectrum.  Some bready notes, crisp honeyed cereals, a little sawdust and very little in the way of fruity esters.  But the hopping is the star of this show and is not limited to the finish/bitterness.  From start to finish you get flavours of various flowers (dandelions and such) intertwined with pine needles leading to a mild juicy bitterness.  Never aggressive the 750ml went down easily despite the 10% abv.  The only problem is the current price tag/rarity but even at $17/bottle I dont think it is a waste of money.  Its never waste money to buy good beer, its my life I waste drinking them.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2880,"2007-12-23",4.9,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2015 My Bottom Line:
A graceful perfume of yellow grapefruit, lemongrass, and pine needles teems with hoppy life, as flickering bubblegum phenols impregnate the doughy maltiness and takes it to comforting levels. This New World Belgian-style Strong Ale is as brimming with life as can be.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A stickly sheet of foam garnishes the misty golden.
-Alcohol is present in the flavor profile, but the spicy fluttering of hoppiness tends to cover it.
-Carbonation is expansive, and soon enough the mouthfeel becomes very comfortable and classy; there are sofa cushions that are less comfy than this...
-The pine character of the Simcoe hoppiness works wonders throughout, but especially in the finish.
-A floral/perfumy character rises from the yeast and hop alliance, recalling some champagne yeast experimentation.
-Like the Hibernus, this Charlevoix is extremely expensive, but they are both rare examples for which a high price can be justified; beer this classy and flavorful is priceless in the eyes of beerophiles.
-This is not Houblon Chouffe at all (even though 2 of the 3 hops used are the same, and the same fusion of hop varieties is called upon), but it is a nearby world. Malheur Brut Reserve isnt too far away either.

Many bottles, thankfully.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
