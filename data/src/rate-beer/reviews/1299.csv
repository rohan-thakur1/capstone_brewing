1299,"2015-06-18",4.2,"6% ABV. Extra Special Bitter.

Hand pumped out of the cask. Tapped a luscious dark nut brown at about 25ºSRM. Nose is full of nice vanilla, cream and oatmeal type flavors. All this came through so cleanly even though I had just got into town in the middle of some heavy pollen and the hayfever was kicking in. 

The palate is lusciously splendid, with full bodied deeply roasted malts. You can tell when you get that first shot of umami on the palate followed by a nice slow slide to ume.

Light carbonation giving it a very hefty mouthfeel. Velvety smooth and a nicely balanced bitter finish. Honors the name ""extra special"". A creamy, rich and very satisfying pint. Likely one the finest. Gets my very special recommendation to try first if available on cask at the Pratt Street Ale House.

1299,"2012-04-13",3.0,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2012 RATING UPDATE: Tried cask version again, this time at Mahaffey?s. Better overall but still not my cup o? tea. A bit too sweet on the tongue for my tastes.  ORIGINAL RATING COMMENTS: Im HOPING that I just got a stinky pour when I got the cask version last night at Wharf Rat, and that perhaps there was something a bit funky as a result of nobody else imbibing of it... the place was DEAD, while just around the corner other joints were hopping!  I tend to really like bitters, see that this ale is usually rated very well, and hope it was just an odd, rare miss. Anyway, it started well enough-- smelled nice and fruity-hoppy, and attractive coloring of amber-copper.  Unfortunately it was downhill from there, as the taste ranged from soapy to sweet to sour, the body seemed off, and it became downright unpleasant to the point that I only drank about half before giving up (and that?s not at all a typical behavior for me!).  I?ll look for it again elsewhere in the future and pray it was just a case of an off firkin/pour.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","mcdoug"
