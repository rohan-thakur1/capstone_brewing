3167,"2013-11-13",3.0,"Blue 180 ml bottle served at a sushi restaurant in Åbenrå, Denmark (served hot). Clear, almost like water body with no head. Aroma has yeast, rice and fusel with a hint of boozy alcohol that becomes stronger as the sake turns less hot. Flavor is quite sweet, some yeast, rice and alcohol fusel. Quite easy to drink, not very complex and I agree with the waitress that recommended to drink this hot as it becomes to boozy served cold.","Kristiansand, NORWAY","Beer5000"

It has a light yeasty-fruity aroma with some alcohol, naked skin and pear.

3167,"2006-04-03",2.9,"unfortunately, I dont know much about sake, but I do appreciate them. I had the opportunity to try this one side to side with the Sanka Junmai and the Karakuchi Junmai Ki-Ippon. Overall, this one was the least exciting. The taste showed linear rice impression although the finish offered a smooth and warming alcohol. The texture was thinner compared to the other two.
