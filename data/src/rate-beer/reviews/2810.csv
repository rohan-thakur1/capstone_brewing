Light straw, slight haze, bubbly white head that dissipated
Aroma of light sweet malts, soft peppery notes, slight citrus, soft lemon
Taste of fresh soft light citrus, slight floral, delicate flavours, soft bit peppery bitterness, well put together, flavour quite unique for a lager
Palate - Medium carb, medium light body, soft bitter citrus, clean, fresh. Finish as main flavour, refreshing, a bit dry, peppery edge.

2810,"2014-04-27",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 28, 2014 75 cl bottle, teku glass. Just shared with my dad and a beautiful piadina. Pours a low/medium head, which doesnt stay there for long. As soon as you approach the glass youre wrapped in a really sublime hoppy, resiny, strawy, papery, almost honey and floreal aroma. This thing smells crazy considering its a pils! The initial taste is an exact smell propagation, with a great floreal fresh,  which gradually transforms into that typical, but very well balanced, hoppy-bitter lasting flavour. Loong, tasty, but delicate finish.This goes perfectly with any panini, pizza, bready-pasta dish.. Theres no other such perfect, and better quality brew to match to your lunch/dinner. A real ""birra da tavola"" (""table beer""), as we would say in Italian, but in a gourmet style. Fully approved, never tiring (would drink liters...), should be always in the fridge, best easy going blond.------ Update -----  had quite some others, especially On Tap (@Solobirra). Always one of the really best in its category. I found the draught one a bit more easy-going for obvious reasons (mainly aroma, crispness), so I suggest you should try at least once this in a fresh bottle. But HeY...

Smooth, kind of soft, lighter carbonation, and a very dry finish (too dry?). Moderate to bigger bitter taste, minimal sweetness. I was skeptical about this the whole way through, but towards the end, as it sat and warmed up a bit it really started to grow on me. Good lightly hoppy longer aftertaste is worth savoring.... Sigh... Was around a 3.2 for this initially, reluctantly raised it to a 3.5 over the course of ~12oz. Gets pretty good damn good after sitting for 30-60 minutes.

Aroma is muted: grassy, white sugar, slight cocoa butter expounds worth. !? Taste at first sits in the mouth and dances around with subtle summer fruitiness and muted citrus. No characters in common whatsoever with most bottom-fermented beers outside of Czech Republic. Then all of a sudden, your palate gets a warp drive of drying, hoppy bitterness that rips away any trace that you just swallowed a liquid and leaves behind a dust trail of beautiful Saaz hops. More refined than Prima Pils and easier to love. This is a wonderful statement to the power of lager beers, which has been lost in the craft beer movement.

2810,"2008-10-28",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2010 In short: On tap it is one of the best session beer I can I have ever had.  In bottle iit is one of the two best pils to come out of a bottle/can (along with Christoffel).
How: Tap at Ma Che Siete Venuti a Fà, Rome Italy.  Bottle 750ml, consumed fresh a few weeks after MatinT brought it from Italia. 
The look: Almost clear blonde body topped by a long lasting small fluffy white head.
In long: Nose of lemony meringue and freshly cut grass.  Big body for the style but with no apparent sweetness.  Just a lot of hay and unsweetened cookies.  Light fruity notes of dried bananas and lemon.  Hops, hops and more hops, this one is loaded with hops.  Dry grass with a little spicy touch from start to finish.  Rather dry.  Extra-pleasant dry tasty bitterness.  I never thought the best Classic German Pilsner in a bottle would be from Italia.  Sometimes an Italian decide to do like the Germans and we get a great beer, and sometimes we get Mussolini.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2810,"2008-09-26",4.7,"A lot of glasses on the tap, every time I end up by chance near Lurago Marinone... ok, sometimes is not ""by chance""...

Engaging appearance, golden-yellow with some light green hint and visible effervescence. White frothy head, which last quite long. The aroma is a perfect blend of light malt and fresh hop. Not too strong but really pleasant. Medium-light body and hoppy bitternes dominating but not overwhelming the malty sweetness.

Delicate fruity accent too and a mild bitterness emerging towards a dry yet light fruity hoppy finish. Nice and tasty pilsner!","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
2810,"2008-08-11",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 13, 2016 My Bottom Line:
Riveting grassy, herbal hops entertain until the very end as balancing hay provides completion and crispness. This may be a Classic German Pilsener, but it certainly seems to be imbued with a touch of Italian flair.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A bobbing head of foam crowns the hazy blond.
-The frothy, soft effervescence admirably propels all flavors.
-This pils proved to be a tad variable in all pints I had. The first in Rome was very hoppy, almost an extra-hopped version of the style. The second, a couple of days later, proved to be a lot yeastier in the flavor profile. I guess they had gotten towards the end of the keg. The glass at the brewery itself was probably the cleanest and most quintessential example of the style I could imagine. Another pint back in Rome was close to the version at the brewery, but with an added citrusy touch. From 4.4 to 3.8, I have to say all pints were immensely enjoyable.
-The bottle proved to be nearly as pleasant as all tap experiences, and reminded me most of the version I had at the brewery.

On tap at the brewery in Lurago Marinone and at Ma Che Siete Venuti a Fà, many times, and bottles back home.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

On the other hand, the flaws become so evident that it becomes easy to make a bad one.  Well this on is good because there aren’t any flaws.  It pours a thicker shade of golden than one usually sees from a pils.  In general its a slightly sweeter and earthy pils with a slightly thicker body.

Pours pure bright golden yellow with massive white head that never fades, and leaves super-sticky lace throughout.  Aroma is ibg beautiful fresh german hops- flowery, light zesty and grass-like, almost sweet and perfume-like with a huge fresh solid pilsner malt backbone that is bready and crackery.  Flavor is a nice blend of fresh flowery and herbal hops mixed with the freshest most solid backbone of pilsner malt- bready, doughy, creamy, snappy and crisp in the finish with perfect bitterness and mineral to make you want to keep drinking more and more.  It is such a shame that every time I have had it in the US, this beer has been a shadow of its fresh-self.  Beautiful beer.  

Had a few times over the last few months.  The most recent was at Gingerman in NYC.  Pours a nice (slight chill haze at first, but clears up) good carbonation and fluffy lasting white head.  Aroma is mostly on the doughy malt side this time, the hops have faded out a bit but still there- earthy and spicy saaz like.  Flavor is again more on the doughy malty side with hops fading quickly- fresh it was nice and floral, spciy hoppy- now the malt comes throuhg and almost playdough like dn cream of wheat character- with a light bitter finish.  Used to be much better when it was first improted in the fall, and even then I wasnt even that impressed.  Maybe I need to have it fresh in Italy.

2810,"2007-12-03",3.9,"One nice pils. I can understand why it is the highest rated pils around. Aroma is bgrassy hops with bready notes as well. Flavor is very similar. Finishes with a nice spicy crispness. Cleanses the palate nicely.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2810,"2007-12-02",3.9,"Bottle and draught. Clear medium yellow color with a large, frothy, good lacing, fully lasting, white head. Aroma is light to moderate malty, hay, moderate hoppy, grass, citrus. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter with a average to long duration, and a very nice dry finish. Body is medium, texture is watery, carbonation is soft. Very refreshing and one off the very best pilsners i have tasted .. Well made Agostino. (051107)","VestJylland, DENMARK","fonefan"
2810,"2007-11-29",4.0,"Draft at Maxs. Clear straw body with a small white head. Lightly herbal nose with cotton candy, honey and grass. The flavor is fairly dry, plenty of herbal/grassy hops, light honey sweetness and some apple. Medium body is round and satisfying with light, dense carbonation. Very nice, but probably better before the long journey over here as the nose seemed pretty dead.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
2810,"2007-11-15",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 16, 2008 Very pale clear appearance, with a thick everlasting white head. Plenty of acacia, little bready. Strong grassy hop notes. Prickly, right bodied, with a wonderful bitter dry finish. What else?","Lovere, ITALY","Scauca"
2810,"2007-10-21",4.2,"Draft, Maxs.  Pours a clear, bright yellow color (a bit light); brilliant white head with decent retention and fine-bubbled lacing; looks innocent enough.  Light aroma: crisp, with a strong herbal and mineral core; just a basic, clean and unimposing crispness.  Absolutely perfect mouthfeel: intensely drinkable, crisp, and dry, while retaining plenty of complexity: toasty cereal, vibrant citrus, herbs and minerals; I could drink gallons of this (quickly) and never be bored; ridiculously sessionable, and ultimately archetypic.  Medium cereal and grain finish, with a bit of sugar.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
2810,"2007-10-19",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2007 Tap at Maxs on Broadway.  Clear, straw golden pour.  Brisk, fresh aroma of banana cream, almond, citrus juices; pure and vibrant hops.  Dry, clinging grass flavor with prickly light spices, nut skins, and a reserved, perfect bitterness.  Light bodied, though with a confident punch.  Easy and simple, though inspired and suffused with full character and classical touch; definitive for summer refreshment or a cleansing session.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
2810,"2007-08-10",5.0,"I did not quite score the beer 5/5 when I had it. There are the ones who would accuse me of showing a bias towards a beer that is pretty much impossible to find. Oh sure they are bottling it now, but how can a bottled pilsners that will have travelled hundreds if not thousands of kilometers be compared to the real deal, on tap at the brewery. Those who accuse me may actually be right, Ill never admit it, but chances are that I was carried by the moment. Luckily, they cant sue me as we are not in Italian juridiction. And certainly not in Lurago Marinone, where I was driven by a gentle soul who rightly suspected I would never find the place with my bicycle unless I had a GPS. He was probably right, the indications from small village to small village could not be less clear to decipher. Perhaps this was one of the reason why I enjoyed the beer even more. Or perhaps because it was shared with my significant other who, for some reason, seemed to prefer a vulgar flowery beer named fleurette, while the tipopils had as much floral aromatics as one may wish for. The tipopils, opaque, perfectly balanced, strong in pure hay-like maltiness, almost avoiding any hints at graininess to ensure ultimate leanness, ultimate balance when the coating hop bitterness grabs your soul, grabs your upper and lower lips into a form vaguely similar to what poets at times refer to as a smile. Fresh, focused, cleansing crisp carbonation. Exceptional quality. Firm body, biscuity flavours that grow and grow as it warms, yet keep this quality that one can only describe as delicacy. Yet dry and this was meant to be. Still you will ask me, is it not against some unwritten ratebeer rule to attribute a 5.0 to a pilsner, this vile, lame style for the wussies who, to this day, remain afraid of darkness, who refuse the offer of a thick plot for mere simplicity. Well why do you drink fellow drinker? Are you looking at new ways to make your life more complicated with thick, sweet, long to drink beefy beers? You may as well make it more complicated by seeking this intricate, subtle gem, the quest of which, I promise, will be as complex as any of those fat beers you rave about. As for myself, as I said earlier, I had initially not given this beer a 5, not that anything was really lacking. But the thing is that, to this day, with a backlog now having passed the thousand, I estimate with a sufficient level of confidence that this beer will very likely remain my favorite of this voyage and thus deserve a special pat in the back. Is it worth a five? Some say none are, I say it is as worthy as pretty much any other.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Soft flowery aroma, with also notes of malt. Soft mouthfeel that begins sweet on the malty side to finish very bitter and aromatic. Long aftertaste and very well balanced. A beer that can be consumed in every moment. One of the best pilsners I have ever had and surely one of the best Italian product there is on the market. Very recommended brewery.","Firenze, ITALY","Slayer85"

2810,"2006-02-15",3.5,"A hazy orange beer with a white head - unfiltered pilsener is not right, but for a different style fine. The flavor is sweet malty with strong notes of straw, while the flavor is sweet and very hoppy giving it a fresh grassy note too, besides a more subdued fruitiness, leading to a good bitter end. Great for a pilsener. Huge thanks to Alex (fiulijn) for sharing this seldom gem.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

Malt and hop aroma, rich but less impressive, and also metallic. More malty and less carbonated; correctly bitter, but the aromatics of the hop are a bit missing. Correctly brewed but not even close to the real one.2012-04-12, 8-5-7-4-14=38Hazy blond color, with the usual rocky head. The aroma is initially not very interesting, with cereals, paper; but later it develops some nice crispy malt.Good clean malt flavor, with correct bitterness, having a grassy character, but not as aromatic as the best batches.This was the last tank brewed in the original location.2009-03-19, 8-5-7-4-15=39Hazy deep blond color, clearer than usual, but with the same creamy head. The aroma is hoppy, medium intensity, grassy. Good malt and strong bitterness, but I miss the crispy touch and better hop aroma.2007-12-29, 10-5-8-5-18=46Wonderful herbal hop aroma, Saaz; it even lightly smokey (chestnuts). The body is quite dry, with almost no sweetness, but with a good crispy malt flavor; luckily we are back to the old bitterness levels: very high. The bitterness is extreme for a Pilsner, and of course the hop is of excellent quality. Needless to say, the final is very long. Its almost unfair to say that it could be perfect if just it had some more sweetness. My best Pils!2005-12-28, 8-5-8-5-17=43I kept drinking this wonderful brew every time I go back to my hometown, but I didnt update the notes for more than three yearsThe appearance is the top of the art, a hazy blond brew with a thick big head, just a masterpiece.Initially the nose is hit by a fresh green hop aroma.Dry mouthfeel, partially malty, with a honey touch, crispy; well bitter; very long final, aromatic hops.I remember it as more aromatic and fruity, but its still my favorite Pilsner around!2002-05-20, 10-5-7-5-18=45Blond pilsner, misty, big head. Wonderful hoppy aroma, lightly floral. Average body, some malt, a strong hop character; fresh hop, wonderful.
