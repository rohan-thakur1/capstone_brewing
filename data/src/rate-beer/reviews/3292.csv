3292,"2017-03-28",4.1,"(draught at the source) Hazy, golden colour with a short and slightly off-white foamy head. Mildly sweet malty aroma with notes of cereals and a present herbal spice, subtle citric hops character. Moderately bitter flavor with a mild but balancing malty sweetness in the background, medium to light bodied, feels like Export strength, smooth well-carbonated mouthfeel. Solid malty base upfront with a tinge of bread, followed by balanced herbal-spicy hops and a whiff of barnyard; lingering bitter-sweet finish. Simply wonderful. 22.III.17","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"

3292,"2014-10-17",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
This rustic lager showcases herbal hop bitterness surrounded by cushy honeyed cereals in a softly carbonated vehicle.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam covers the misty golden.
-Citrus rind allusions are found as well.
-This is not unlike some of Czechias unfiltered brewpub Leáks.
-This ones on the verge of being great. Which, for a gloomy pub which reeks of depression, is a beacon of hope.

3292,"2014-07-28",3.8,"Unfiltered, gravity pour (bayerischer Anstich) at Gastof Heckel in Dec. 2013: Lightly hazed golden. Creamy halo of foam encircles the fragmented cap of foam. Soft, delicate, and polished aroma of flowers (100% Hallertauer), apricot, honey, and fresh baked bread. Fluffy and dense carbonation. Exquisite malt textures envelop the palate with sturdy cakelike suggestions and abundant softness reminiscent of hay dust. Kiss of dusty yeast commendably adorns the bodys dryness. Oily hop acids slake the thirst and offset the sugars as they sizzle brightly amid the fluffy and scratchy yeast-driven rusticity. Honeyish sweetness and a peach marmalade twang yield a dense body as does the high concentration of haylike malt. Characterfully yeasty finish features full and soft malts, hints of edgy toast, and continually unraveling pillowy hay dust textures underscored by restrained aniseed hop spice. Perhaps a tad one-dimension and on the sugary side, but one of the more singular beers (and experiences), youll find in beautiful Franconia. I am mystified, but thoroughly heartened, to know that a place like this exists in todays increasingly industrial world. If there is a quainter place in all of Franconia, it has somehow escaped my radar. Come here if you want to get a glimpse of bygone days, before a this treasure is gone forever.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3292,"2013-12-02",3.5,"Draft at the brewerys pub in Waischenfeld.
Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is medium yellow.
Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain), lightly to moderately hoppy (flowers, herbs), with light notes of alcohol, concrete.
Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately bitter.
Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.
Fairly solid...decent hopping and balance. Some concrete/chalk-like character dulls it somewhat, but its better than average.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3292,"2013-12-01",4.2,"Vom fass at Gastof Heckel in Waischenfeld. 
Lightly hazed amber-hued gold with a fine white head. 
Toasty and rich with a delicious honey melanoidin flavor. 
Light gaminess, mustiness, rustic yeast. 
Grassy and herbal and spicy hops with quieter lemon and mint suggestions. 
Juicy, malty, sweet, savory, succulent. 
Remarkably good from the first sip, at times seems to sit between richer helles and lighter Heller Bock. 
Unlike many Franconian helles landbier in character and certainly demanding of attention.
