4042,"2017-05-16",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 17, 2017 Can into a snifter showing lightly filtered apricot orange with half a finger of quickly dissipating clean white foam. 

The nose shows a lot of juicy and ripe peach and mango with a light bed of adzuki NE style malt. 

The palate is light bodied and well carbonated. Flavors of juicy mango and peach throughout with a perfectly balanced NE style malt. Mild bitterness on the finish to tie off the entire ale. At 5.5% ABV, this fruit forward profile and this is nigh perfection for any measure of a pale ale.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
4042,"2017-05-07",4.2,"Can acquired from brewery release. Pours a lite grapefruit haze. Tastes of ripe grapefruit, orange juice and orange rind. Really fantastic and yet they make another great pale ale that exceeds expectations. Love it.","seattle, Washington, USA","cobaink2"
4042,"2017-04-26",4.0,"16 oz. can from poisoneddwarf - thanks again! Pours a hazy pale gold with a small white head that settles into a lasting thick ring and thin film. Notes of pineapple, guava, pear, grape, sweet doughy malts, florals, tangerine, oats, and apricot. Light-medium bodied, with modest carbonation and a sweet, fruity, muddled, just barely bitter mouthfeel. Good NE style IPA.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
4042,"2017-04-11",4.1,"16 oz can, thanks Poisoneddwarf for picking this- Pours extremely hazy cloudy orange with a medium white head with great retention. Aroma is resinous, dank, citrusy, raw malt. The taste is pine resin, sweet raw malt, could be the malted oats i am tasting, dank, citrus is less than i was expecting. Good beer.","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"
4042,"2017-04-09",4.4,"16 oz can from the release yesterday. Aroma is tropical fruit, creamsicle, grapefruit rind, sex. Pours extremely hazy yellow-orange with a long-sustaining off-white head that leaves some nice lace. Taste is lightly bitter with flavors of the aroma, along with lots of juicy citrus, light grain. A tad watery maybe, but not too detrimental. Awesome stuff here.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
4042,"2016-11-09",4.0,"On tap @ Holy Mountain. Pours a bright almost glowing hazy yellow golden with thin white head. Aroma is fresh-squeezed citrus juice - mango, lemon, orange stand out. Taste is smooth cream mouthfeel - malted oats show clearly here - big juicy citrus, lightly dank and hoppy on the finish with a slight lingering citrus tang. Outstanding and well-deserving of all the praise.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"
4042,"2016-11-05",3.9,"On tap at Holy Mountain, pours a cloudy yellow with a small white head. Aroma brings out dank, juicy dry hopping upfront, with just enough biscuity malt. Flavour is likewise dank and juicy, with lots of hop character. Super juicy and only lightly bitter on the finish. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
4042,"2016-09-12",4.2,"Huge thanks to Luttonm who surprised me with a Seattle care package complete with a growler of this beauty. Pours a glorious opaque glowing gold, with creamy white head. Seriously, like the glowing Grail beacon that nearly lured Galahad to his doom. Aroma is basically juice - tropical-grapefruit cocktail of awesome. Tastes sweet and juicy, ends with mild but appropriate bitterness. Medium- body, smooth creamy+oily texture, average carbonation. Overall: this is fantastic.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
4042,"2016-09-05",4.1,"Draft at HoMo, then more glasses, then a growler full for later. Pours a cloudy, turbid, lets-make-some-all-purpose-flour-jokes densely opaque medium orange with a creamy thick white head that sticks around. Seriously, you can tell which beer is in which growler by how thick and turbid this beer is. Now, no mistake--its not the finest grain of sandpaper in the brewers toolkit, making a beer super-hazy. Thats why its worth making fun of brewers who add AP flour to their beers to haze them up. You should make fun of them every chance you get. Because brewers who do have the skills to pay the piper, plus all the bills, are out here making hazy beers that are not only not something you can read a newspaper through, but are also delicious. And thats what we have here. Body looks normal-thick, not slushy or sludgy at all, just looks like a river after a ferocious thunderstorm. Nose is bright and tangy, loaded with mandarins and a bit of stone fruit along with tropical notes. Creamy medium body, moderate carb, no huskiness or graininess. Lightly toasted caramel and cheerio under a bursting juicy payload of mandarin, pineapple, and stone fruit. Long tangy sweet finish. Fantastic.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
4042,"2016-09-03",4.3,"Tap. Exceptional. Potent orange and citrus hop aroma. Cloudy gold. Unfiltered is an understatement but ive never had a creamier beer. Flavor is dank orange, citrus, pineapple. Low abv is a surprise as well. Nailed it.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
4042,"2016-09-03",3.9,"Draft 12 oz (I think) at Holy Mountain. Lush Lady Land! Super thick and creamy pineapple juicenpour with a thin fizz head. Heavy dank hops and thin citrus aroma. Such a creamy texture to it, seperating it from the west coast competition. Pleasant citrus constant. Tries to have a tart side, but doesnt quite get there, appropriately. A supreme juiciness. Hop bitter late reminder. I can easily get on board with this. Just a thought though, since Im here on peach sour release day. Throw peaches in this beer. It would be damn near a perfect brew.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
4042,"2016-08-29",4.3,"Draught at the brewery, 8/19/16.Intensely hazy, borderline soupy!! Golden-bronze body is topped by a fairly well-retained, white head.First off, its just awesome to see the influence of the New England hops scene out here in Seattle and second off, Damn, did they nail this! Supremely juicy, soft, lightly malty (honey, biscuit, wheat flour) nose is bursting with nectarine, mango, pineapple and key lime. Theres a bit of assertive grapefruit, but just enough to add some dryness/depth to the hop aromatics. No alcohol or flaw.And just as the nose, its beautifully juicy in the flavor. Sweet (not too much so) and heavily comforting on the palate, with wheat and soft malt sugars and a tight carbonation. Limes, mangoes, ruby red grapefruit and light cherry with just a touch of bitterness on the end. Another grand success for comet hops, which seem to be one of the very best.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4042,"2016-08-27",3.9,"Draft pour at brewery, (from last week) cloudy almost orange juice color pour, little sweet aroma. Flavor is smooth and bitter at the same time, nice acid balanceed summer beer.","Duvall, Washington, USA","tcon25"
4042,"2016-08-22",4.1,"HM, Seattle. Modern IPA look: completely clouded grapefruit juice. Just missing the pulp. Lacing foam. Delicious, pungent fruit wafting up. Melon, guava, plenty of dank citrus. Smooth, juicy first sip is clobbered by a balancing bitterness. That bitter note, which cleans this up and balances, also seems to be a nice (innovative?) riff on this new style. Bittering grapefruit finish, relatively clean and lingering. I love this.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
4042,"2016-08-19",3.8,"On tap at the brewery. Murky, milky yellow pour. Soft, creamy grapefruit and mandarin on the nose, like a gourmet creamsicle or Orange Julius. Sort of love that. Dank, yeasty flavor. Gym socks with grassy citrus. Slightly herbal finish. Can a beer be ""chunky?"" Because this is, despite the lack of chunks.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"
