2186,"2016-10-06",3.2,"Draft to pint at cappys pour murky opaque light brown with thin tan head. Nose caramel malts and toffee, light spice. Taste caramel, green apple, and light bitterness late. Not my favorite style.","Loveland, Ohio, USA","drsordr"
2186,"2016-09-27",3.9,"12 ounce bottle into mug, bottled on 8/11/2016. Pours lightly hazy deep reddish copper/brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing cling on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, light chocolate/cocoa/coffee, herbal, wood, light pepper, and roast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, light chocolate/cocoa/coffee, herbal, wood, light pepper, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, light chocolate, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Light dryness from bitterness/roast as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready, and lightly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol for 7.5%. Overall this a very nice imperial Marzen. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. This felt closer to a traditional bock due to the light roasted character that was present; but still very enjoyable all around.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
2186,"2016-09-21",3.8,"My number one want when I started on Ratebeer...Deep reddish orangish brown. Biscuity, toasty, caramel malt. Flavor follows with uber-Special B. Raisin toasted malt, burnt biscuit, caramel, and molasses. Strong ale barley-wine esque. Not expected but good.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
2186,"2016-09-17",4.2,"Pours a dark brown with an off-white foam head. Aroma is caramel, toffee, and bread malts. Flavor is biscuit, roast, sweet caramel, toffee, and bread malts. Has a smooth body with some carbonation. Excellent. Might be my favorite Oktoberfest beer.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","chucklemation"
2186,"2016-09-06",3.7,"Bottle. Pretty reddish brown color with a thick, bubbly head. Malty nose, fudge, chocolate, cinnamon, caramel. Toasty, crackery malt flavor, charred toast, caramel, chocolate. Big malt is very tasty. This is basically an toasty amber doppelbock. Very nice, but not fair to compete it against other marzens.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"

2186,"2016-08-25",4.0,"One of the best October fest beers I've had. The pour and look of this beer set it apart from the rest. It is a dark gold murky look that has a nice head. Taste is malty. A lot of toast and bread in this great beer!","North Carolina, USA","Lutz2jm"
2186,"2015-11-24",3.7,"Draught at Beer Trappe. Caramel and toffee to some extent. Mild in taste. Finish is slightly sweet. Nice.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
2186,"2015-10-09",3.7,"Pour on tap at HopCat, slightly hazy reddish pour with off white head, aroma brought notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, some bread, hints of earth, spice, some yeasty notes as well. Taste was a mix of grass, bread, biscuit, dough, yeast, some slight toast, cracker, caramel, hints of grass, spice, finishing slightly bitter. Pretty tasty, no sign of the 8% and the flavors are pretty classic for Marzen styles.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
2186,"2015-09-12",3.9,"On tap at Dark Horse. Very good malt forward beer. Wonderful caramel aroma as well as taste. Maybe the most flavorable Octoberfest Ive had. Well done.","Portland, Michigan, USA","BrownALEx"
2186,"2014-12-15",3.1,"Tap @ Dark Horse: Muddled burnt amber with a brown center. Opaque, skimmed with a thin, dark-khaki foam on top. Aroma of toasted CaraMunich malts, lots of semi-residual sweetness, light toffee, toasted bread, faint nuts, & a hint of sweet plum. Flavor is even more sweet up front, hitting heavy with loads of caramel malt, toffee, & plum flavors. Back-end shows more of a toasted breadiness with a light metallic twinge towards the finish. Strong toffee coated bread lingering in the aftertaste. A little heavy on the sweetness overall, but still not a bad O-fest.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
2186,"2014-10-16",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2016 Draft at Dark Horse taproom. Pours a really murky brown with a small off white head. Mild toasty bread aroma. Flavor of malt, caramel and nuts. Big nutty mouthfeel. Hard to believe its taken me so many years to try this one. Very nice Octoberfest.beer. Big body separates it from most of the other Octoberfest beers Ive had.

Just rated this again, forgetting that I had rated before.  Funny that two years later my notes are almost exactly as before.  This time I was drinking from a bottle.  This really is a nice offering from Dark Horse.","Coldwater, Michigan, USA","wmubronco1992"

2186,"2009-10-18",3.5,"Bottle. Poured an amber orange with a beige head. Aroma was full of grainy and malty notes with a light floral undertone. Flavor was nice with a bready touch with and undertone of citrus hops. Amazingly smooth on the tongue.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
2186,"2009-10-09",3.7,"Growler from Schroppfy, some of which leaked out during shipping.  Pours a clear, dark, reddish-copper hue.  A small, bubbly, tan colored layer of foam leaves no lacing behind, though the growler likely had alot to do with that.  The aroma shows loads of toast and caramel, very fresh and bready overall, with a smooth, dark cereal grain overtone and a delicate floral hopping. Flavors follow suit, really well balanced, with fresh cereal and toast malts, a hint of biscuit sweetness, and perhaps even the slightest little bit of burnt marshmallow.  Floral hops lend balance, and a touch of wood brings in some earthiness.  Medium-plus in body, smooth, and easy drinking, not a bit of the 8% ABV comes through.  Damn, despite the growler leak, this might just be the best Oktoberfest Ive had to date.  Reminds me alot of the base for the Schlenkerla Fastenbier, obviously without the beechwood smoke.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
2186,"2009-10-09",3.6,"Courtesy Beerlando. Dark cherry color with little head. Roasted grain, toffee, dark malt aroma. Taste is smooth woody, dark malt, bready with some bitterness in the taste. Really nice beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
2186,"2009-10-08",3.4,"Courtesy Beerlando, from a somewhat compromised growler. Brown with a bit of off white carbonation. Great malt flavor, more similar to a dunkel than a lot of the festbiers Ive had. Toasty and bready with mild bitterness. Medium body, smooth. Damn tasty.","Florida, USA","SoLan"
2186,"2008-04-17",4.1,"From Growler - 2005.  A powerful, spicey, malty, sweet powerhouse of an Octoberfest.  As good as it gets - probably my ATF Fest beer.","Dallas, Texas, USA","dukefan"

2186,"2004-09-26",4.2,"Dark Brown, light long lasting tan head. Kind of fruity mouthfeel, good. Followed with nuts and malts. Medium yet full body. Very good for  unfiltered.Great. Wish I got it on Tap.","West Paterson, New Jersey, USA","Lou18"
2186,"2004-03-04",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2004 2003 bottle.  WOW.  Bottle conditioned, hazy, dark brownish-tan with some light oranges.  Good oatmeal colored head.  Aroma is crisp, hoppy (quite a bit of bitterness) and has a hint of red raspberry.  Opens up with a flavor so fresh, it dosent even taste bottled.  Pure, clean spicy hops, full bodied, with plenty of toasted malt goodness.  No harsh dry tones, no astringency, just incredible flavorful beer.  If I was rating to style, this wouldnt get many points as it is very hoppy (too high alpha hops content for a marzen) but hell, this tastes so good, I dont care what style it is.  Pure milk chocolate on the finish that lingers on.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2186,"2003-11-27",3.4,"This is the darkest Oktoberfest I've encountered, pouring a dark red-brown with a light tan head.  This is also a surprisingly hoppy beer.  Floral, grassy, spicy and slightly bitter hops subdue the lighter caramel malts in both the aroma and the flavor.  Not sure this really belongs under the Oktoberfest category, despite the name.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
2186,"2003-11-04",3.9,"Brownish amber with a medium sized tan head. nice sweet malty aroma and taste. Medium bodied and quite fruity as well with some nuttiness, and a slightly bitter hop finish. This was a very enjoyable brew.","Kentwood, Michigan, USA","bubslang"

2186,"2003-10-22",3.8,"Bottled. Pale brown with beige head. Citrusy hops up front. Fruity, malty and soft with loads of cookie malt. Quite bitter fruity finish. Very hop accented, but with good balance. Not even remotely similar to German oktoberfests, but a great beer.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
2186,"2003-10-16",3.4,"This is definitely a beer that you don't drink straight from the fridge. Give it 10 minutes or so to warm up.
It pours a murky brownish color with a small head. 
The aroma is sweet and malty. This brew is medium bodied. 
Personally, I prefer the appearance of a filtered O'fest, but the flavors on this puppy are hard to dispute. Pretty nice.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
2186,"2003-10-15",4.0,"This beer pours with a dark reddish brown body topped by a medium thick to thick off white, foamy head with good lacing.

In any event, this was worth the delay, to be sure, a beuatifully bellowing creature of a fest with full, hearty tuba noted malts and the sharp spiced hops trumpeting in.  Nicely done.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
