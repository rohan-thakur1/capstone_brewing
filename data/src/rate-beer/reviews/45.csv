45,"2015-12-17",4.6,"On tap at barVolo in Toronto, served in a weizenglass.

Appearance: Golden, somewhat cloudy, with a long-lingering bright white head several fingers thick - more or less exactly what one wants to see in a hefe.

Smell: Ripe wheat ready for the harvest, wreathed through with banana and pear so thick they can almost be tasted without taking a sip, and heavy with notes of coriander and clove spice.

Taste: Beautifully well executed. The beer opens with a rush of banana flavor, which is swiftly joined by pear, white grape, and a considerable dose of coriander citrus. Clove swims in the background as the fruity flavors swirl and mingle. The aftertaste is primarily banana and bubblegum, with some coriander orange lingering a bit longer.

Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy, and fluffy, this is fairly full-bodied for a hefe.

Overall: One of the better hefes Ive had that was not brewed in Bavaria. The next time I find myself anywhere near the Side Launch distribution footprint, a decent amount of this beer will find its way home with me.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Au nez, on ressent de la banane (évidemment), des arômes de levures allemandes et une pointe de grains de coriandre. Ces arômes me rappellent curieusement le Ginger Ale. Est-ce un plus? Un moins? Je ne saurais dire! La bière, sans toutefois être complexe en bouche, est précise et à mon avis, réussie dans son style. On passe de la levure weiss aux blés dansant dans les champs sous une brise estivale. Ça goûte lété (pardonnez-moi cet insupportable cliché, mais cest vrai!), léger tout en étant suffisamment sucré et balancé. Le coprs est mince/moyen et les saveurs sont délicates mais agréablement assez longues en bouche. Je suis peut-être un mauvais critique dune telle bière car ce style nest pas le mien et je laurais sans doute préférée en été plutôt quen mars; je crois somme toute quelle est très réussie et mérite quon sy attarde.

45,"2013-06-27",3.6,"2013/06/27 - Pours a cloudy, pale yellow color with a small, fizzy, white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is wheat, citrus (mainly orange) and cloves. Taste is similar to nose with a slightly sour aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium with lots of carbonation and a juicy finish. I found the flavor slightly muted and expected banana esters instead of citrus. Decently executed hefeweizen.

45,"2013-04-12",4.6,"Completely surprised by an Ontario brewer that I picked up this week from the LCBO for its quality in this style as this province is known for its reverse Midas touch on craft breweries.

A - Excellent frothy head which remained about one inch for the entire time to consume it (10 min).  Cloudy and slight orange tinge which is consistant with this style.

S - Cloves, banana, and citrus aroma as described were pleasantly present.  Hops are subtle.

T - slightly sweet with sour overtones from the citrus.  The coriander, orange, and cloves come out on the palate which I greatly enjoyed.  Wheat taste with some bread-like flavours.

M - Higher carbonation than I like for Weissbiers but defiantly not a point of contention.  Medium bodied that ends with a creamy and slightly sour taste.
 
Overall: If you like Hoegaarden, youll love this.  I am defiantly purchasing this again and will try to replicate it in my monthly all-grain home brewing.

Pours a beautiful clouded golden color with a firm head that is quick to dissipate.  I pick up some fruit (citrus and banana, and maybe even sour grape).  I find that this time around trying the cans is a much more enjoyable experience -- the first time I tried it when the beer was launched in the LCBO I was disappointed by the extreme sour/bitter flavors but it is much mellower now.

After getting to town and getting settled in I had Cest What to myself for a few hours.  This was my first pint and I am glad I did not ask for just a half pour.  Spending my time enjoying it I could have had nothing else the rest of the trip and been happy.  This is an ideal hefe that is both easy drinking and flavorful.

Aroma / Appearance 
 - Hazy golden orange in hue the white head sparkled in the basement light.  Lemon rinds, orange peels, and other sharp crisp fruity aspects made this a rival for some of the better hefes I have tried in memory.

Flavor / Palate - Carbonated with a nice kick the little bit of hops jolt the senses to life.  A sea of fruity citrus (lemon and orange) makes the palate sit up and beg for more.  It tastes almost like peach champagne.  My only problem may be that after two full points of this I would be so full I could not enjoy any more.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

A long finish in fun hops, spiciness, and creamed malt character. Delicious. I think this is solid, but not mind-blowing. The yeast characters are great. The wheat good, the hops nice, the beer refreshing, but it doesnt break any Hefe barriers. Its just a damn good, solid example. On further thought, the most astounding feature of this beer is its finish. It just goes on and on in rich lemon, wheat, and spice complexity.

Had on tap many times and enjoyed every last ounce.

Drinking from a can right now. Certainly doesnt live up to the perfection of the on-tap version, oh how I wish it were bottled and not canned! Im still going to enjoy the 12 cans I bought though because its not bad. Great to be able to take home. Loses a bit of complexity in the palate, and the aftertaste is somewhat muted in comparison to the on tap version. Still silky smooth, I have a little bit of a cold right now and therefore the flavours and aroma cannot be assessed perfectly, but it seems to have lost a little bit of the spice that is prominent in the tapped version while still retaining some nice banana flavours.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Listigovers"

A presumably constantly fresh and complete weizen. A sure bet in Toronto.

I like:
Pleasant and polite equilibrium between esters and phenols, aptly leaning more towards banana esters. Crisp wheaty body with excellent extraction. Creamy, pie crust reminiscent richness. Very clean instead of playing on yeasty complexity. Extremely drinkable, sweeter than average and good-looking. Sweet, but certainly tart enough to compensate.

Strong aroma of slightly overripe bananas (it also reminds me a bit of a dental dam -- but perhaps Ive encountered an exquisitely aromatic dental dam at some point during my youth.) Some clove is also present. The beer rolls through the mouth in a manner that is somehow notable. Orange peel is prevalent. Im reminded of wild rice at the end of each sip. Sweet and loads of citrus. Banana also joins the flavour as it warms. Medium bodied. Leaves a faint, sodium-like aftertaste. ""Bombastic"" comes to mind. Bombastic and delicious.","Waterloo, Ontario, CANADA","Gpnterojd"

45,"2008-01-31",4.2,"On tap at the Castle. Pours a very nice hazy gold, with a large white head. The aroma is a very enticing mix of yeasty esters and malty goodness. The classic banana and clove. Taste is the same, but the sweet malt touch, almost a bit grainy, has a delicious quality all its own, sort of ""barnyard""-esque, something Ive never had in a wheat beer ever before. The mouth-feel is fuller than youd expect, almost sticky, like chewy malts, kind of reminiscent of bread. Maybe its just because it was fresh, but this seems like the pinnacle of what a good hefe should be. Best in the world? I cant say, but its the best hefe-weizen Ill probably ever come across. It didnt blow me away, yet the more I think about it, the more I like it. Good thing this is a staple at the Castle because I want more!","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

Amazing clove aroma opens up into a refreshing Banana and slight citrus taste, that will leave you never wanting for more..... until its gone, and you want MORE!

I was surprised to find something so good for so cheap, and the ratings here confirm that Im not the only one who thinks so.

It deserves as much or more credit than Schneider Weisse, probably the classic German example, and to which it is quite similar in terms of the banana/clove/citrus balance.  The finish of Denisons is somewhat more tart and acidic.  There can be some differences among individual batches, however, so expect some interesting variations from time to time.

Since this is a local brew and chances of me making it back up to the Great White North anytime soon were remote, I led off with this one and was not displeased.  The body was rich and golden as typical of a good hefe.  The head was thick and creamy.  No orange wedge was served and that was nice.  It smelled of banana nut crunch and bubblegum.  At the first swallow, the brew was slightly chilled and the taste mimicked the aromas.

45,"2003-07-10",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 30, 2007 August 2007. Draft at Volo. Yellow-orange body with a nice fluffy white head. Very yeasty aroma with moderate banana esters and muted citrus notes. (7+) Yeasty flavour as well with a healthy dose of banana esters, very light bitterness throughout, light hints of lemon citrus. Medium bodied palate. Very quaffable and refreshing with more than enough flavour to be interesting 7+/5/8/4/17 - 4.1

<P>June 13 2003. St. Lawrence Market Craft Beer Show . I tried the Denisons at Cest What earlier in the week and was pleased to see that it was still as excellent as I remember from Denisons brewpub. I was eager to compare the two side by side. The Wunder Weisse was also excellent, but had more clove flavour than Denisons. I prefer the Denisons as I find it leans slightly more towards the fruity side of the equation with just enough clove. I believe that is a result of the yeast strains used but I could be wrong. Either way, I look forward to seeing Denisons in the LCBO or the beer store. 7/5/8/4/18 -4.2","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

The second time it was popped open, a little less life leaped out.  Still a fat wheat beer worthy of all the praise.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
45,"2003-07-04",4.3,"Summer Gathering 2003: Massive thanks to Oakes for toting that impressive growler down for us all to sample. Loved this one--Perfect clove/banana nose; Cloudy yellow with a nice white head; semi-sweet banana-y flavor, creamy.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
45,"2003-07-02",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2008 Bottle... RBSG2003... Murky, deep golden brew. White, creamy, lasting head.
The aroma holds banana and clove. Imagine that! Ok, ok, bubblegum too.
The flavor is spicey and refreshing. Tart and tangy. Well-balanced.
Light-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Short, dry finish. As a rule, Im not BIG on wheat beers, but I really like this one!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
45,"2003-07-01",4.0,"Growler.  Aroma of banana, clove, lemon, yeast, very faint lactic acid and plenty of esters.  Solid, opaque golden yellow color, quite a lot of yeast in this one.  Lemony, fruity flavors abound, again just slightly lactic and quite spicy, especially on the finish.  Very nice and one of the better German Wheats I've sampled to date.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
45,"2003-07-01",4.0,"A nice hazy golden yellow with decent head formation from a growler.  The aroma had a nice banana scent, a bit of clove, and a yeasty liveliness.  The flavor also had a strong banana character, but was not as sweet as most beers that I am familiar with in this style.  Smooth maltiness, a bit of spice and nice carbonation make for a tasty beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
45,"2003-06-28",3.7,"Ratebeer Fest 2003: Poured a cloudy dark yellow with dissipating white head. Light banana notes and seems a bit thin in the finish. Doesn't match up to New Glarus' Solstice. No comparison.","Nolanville, USA","MrRomero"
45,"2003-06-21",3.9,"Murkey yellow in colour with a huge banana aroma.  Flavour is of wheat, banana and is quite sweet.  This is a great summer beer.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","radiomgb"
45,"2003-05-11",4.3,"WOW! this was great. It was a surprise for me when I walked into the Mill Street Brewery yesterday to see this on tap there. I wasn't aware of it's high appeal at all until I read a little write up that the girl at the counter gave me after I was half done my sample. She also told me that it might be in bottle form in the fall but she didn't know for sure if it would happen. Now to the beer Bananas were obvious to me and the sweetness was smooth and beautiful. Later that day I went to Smokeless Joes for the first time with a friend. I saw it on tap and took a much larger sample! It made me happy. The End.","Brantford, Ontario, CANADA","Cartoonkhaki"
45,"2003-05-05",4.4,"Michael Hancocks's Weizen is a perfect example of Bavarian Hefe-Weizen. The nose is filled with fresh banana and clove aromas, the middle is loaded with yeasty complexity and the lingering finish begs another sip (or pint!) A true classic!","Fitzroy Harbour, Ontario, CANADA","pondoshuffles"
45,"2003-02-03",4.8,"This one is a knock out. Best beer of this style I ever tasted. Since 1996, I've been a loyal sampler. You gotta open up somewhere. Don't take this away from me.","Ontario, CANADA","Bolo"
45,"2003-01-20",4.3,"Excellen weizen aroma with lots of banana.  Nice color. Definitely one of the better weizens in North America, even when it was snowing outside the brewery! The only knock I would have is that it seemed a bit thin on the finish.","Mentor, Ohio, USA","alebrewer"
45,"2002-11-19",4.7,"its been a little while since Ive had this beer, but even in the freezing weather this is amazing.  theres not much I can say other than this is pure weizen perfection.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mrkimchee"
45,"2002-11-01",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2003 Let me see... lemony, yeasty, long, somewhat complex.  But a little too light for me, reminiscent of Hacker.  But very impressive indeed, especially as a Canadian entry.  (Jan 19th, 2003) NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  It""s closed!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DukeofYork"
45,"2002-09-28",3.4,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2003 Nicely made German wheat. I had pleasant aroma and look. Very refreshing but it does need a bit more banana flavour.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"
45,"2002-09-06",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 11, 2003 Re-rating to reflect the new Mill St. version, although it's really not very different, and my numerical ratings haven't changed. I'm SO glad that this beer has been revived after the closure of Denison's Brewpub earlier this year. It remains a world class example of it's style, with the classic banana and clove combo in the aroma, wonderful fruit and yeast in the flavour, and that amazingly crisp and lingering finish that keeps you coming back for more. I can't wait for patio season to start so I can sit in the sun on a warm afternoon and enjoy a pint or two (or three...) of this. Ahhhhhh...","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
45,"2002-09-02",4.4,"Cloudy harvest gold w/ good head & lacing. Very aromatic: yeasty, fruity (banana), cloves. Wonderful mouthfeel: fluffy & creamy but also light. Sweet malty flavours w/ lovely banana & lemon notes. Great beer.","Waterdown, Ontario, CANADA","joeycapps"
45,"2002-08-21",4.3,"Amazing sweet, fresh candy aroma (of cotton candy).  Unfiltered gold color.  Very sweet, but pleasant (not cloying) flavor with a little bit of candy in the flavor, with some lemon (just a hint) in there, too, for good measure.","Washington DC, USA","Kathy"
45,"2002-08-20",4.7,"Available only at the brew pub although this may change soon.  This is the best Weizen Ive had out of Ontario.  Beautiful straw like colour with a very resilient head. Heavier on the banana/bubblegum and less  cloves.  This pub is a required stop for any beer hunter going through Toronto.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"
45,"2002-08-13",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 12, 2003 Cloudy orange color.  Great aroma of orange, banana, light fruit and even bubblegum.  Some hints of yeast and a very light spiciness.  The body is spritzy with a light roasted hop beginning.  Dries quickly towards the end and is somewhat light.  There isn't any tartness but there is a light tangy quality rounded with some orange notes.  Very nice wheat, welcome back.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"
45,"2002-07-31",4.2,"Outstanding. Such attention to quality. A great brewery tour of a fine facility. German authenticity in every corner of the room, in every personage. Aroma is so far beyond bubblegum and banana. Mild flavors meld beautifully in the mouth, clove not particularly pronounced, long finish but not sharp. An excellent beer.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
45,"2002-07-30",4.4,"Probably the best of this style Ive had. Banana and lemon are very evident in the aroma and an overall smooth and fruity character makes this a very enjoyable tipple. Creamy head with sweet finish. Excellent!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Strange Brew"
45,"2002-07-23",4.2,"This is the best wheat beer that I have had (well besides Aventinus, and this is different).  Murky yellow color. Banana, fruit, banana, bubble-gum and banana aroma that reaches over into taste.  Ends sweet and quick.  I could drink this all day.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
45,"2002-07-22",3.6,"Unfiltered yellow, nice head.  Banana malty aroma.  Mild and sweet, this is an easy drinking summer beer, just as the Germans who created this style intended.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
45,"2002-06-08",4.0,"Great wheat aroma. Cloudy golden colour. First taste is fabulous, wheat, malt, spices, and bananas. Last drop is still fabulous. Wonderful tongue tingle, extra smooth. Excellent.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DougShoemaker"
