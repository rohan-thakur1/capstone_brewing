2834,"2017-04-11",4.2,"Golden color with a medium sized, white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Grassy hops, pils malt, toast, grains, and crisp finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
2834,"2017-01-25",3.8,"Pours a clear golden with small to medium white head and full sheets of lacing. Nose is malt, fruit, bread, and other crisp hops. Flavor is most of the same. Well executed Pilsner.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
2834,"2016-11-05",3.4,"Crystal clear light golden with a pleasantly thick fluffy white head. Grainy light toast nose with a light earthy noble hop bitterness. Crisp and very clean flavor thats lightly grainy, lightly earthy grassy hopped and lightly bitter. Not to say its all light but its a clean and crisp very classical Pilsner, very top notch and refreshing.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
2834,"2016-10-25",4.1,"On tap at Bierstadt poured a clear yellow with a lasting white head. Aromas of bread, yeast and light citrus. Palate was lught bodied and crisp with a dry finish. Flavors of bread, fruitiness and light yeast with a crisp dry lingering fruity finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
2834,"2016-10-20",3.7,"On tap at Bierstadt Lagerhaus (Rackhouse Pub). Clear golden appearance with a fluffy, lingering white head. Pleasant aroma of toasted grain and noble hops. Similar flavor, lightly sweet and mildly bitter. Clean, refreshing and easy to drink. A top notch pils overall.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
2834,"2016-10-07",3.5,"Draft. Yellow body with a big, white head, lasting. Aroma of toasted grain, floral hops, herbs, light lemon and grass. The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly bitter. It finishes lightly to moderately sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation. On the sweet side, but clean. Its right on the edge between delicate and too thin. Enough flavor of grass, lemon and floral hops to keep it from falling into the lite pit. Enjoyable.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
2834,"2016-09-18",3.8,"Tap at the brewery - lively, clear gold pour, with a fluffy, lasting head - nose of flowers, grass, mineral, clean pils malt - flavor is dry, crisp, moderately savory - grassy and floral hop character becomes spicy towards the finish - a touch of sulfur on the tail end, but mostly clean and enjoyable.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
2834,"2016-09-18",3.5,"Lightly hazed pale gold with a lasting white head. Initial aroma impression is strongly hoppy in the way of grass, lemon, herbs, perfume, noble strains clearly evident. These hops are a little too raw / grassy (pellet-like) but overall enjoyable, though when warmer I start picking up a cheesy-musty note which could be old cones. Pale malt is crackers and saccharine and is expressed well. In the mouth its light bodied with sweetness well-balanced by quenching bitterness. Carbonation is fluffy and prickly hop acids and a pleasant scrape of carbonic acid washes the finish. Theres a little bit of BO stink / sulfur in the aroma after it warms, though not unpleasant. Overall a surprisingly solid Pilsner with clean fermentation and enjoyable ingredient expression.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
2834,"2016-09-17",3.4,"Draft at Bierstadt.
Head is initially large, creamy/frothy, white, mostly lasting.
Body is light yellow.
Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain, husks), lightly to moderately hoppy (herbs, flowers), with a hint of egg.
Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, moderately bitter, slightly husky.
Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, slightly metallic.

Not too bad...a touch grainy/husky, but good bitterness and reasonably clean. Nice texture for the style as well. Certainly better than Prost, where this brewer apparently came from.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2834,"2016-09-06",3.9,"(En fût à Falling Rock): Floral mais surtout herbacé, très vif, fromage subtile et sulfure bouillant dans une concoction sèche et adéquatement céréalière. Ça promet.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
2834,"2016-08-31",3.5,"Tap at Falling Rock. Medium pale gold, touch of orange, fine head. Nose of lemon, some grass, crisp malt. Lemony, slightly tart from the hops, crisp malt flavor. Seems more in the North German mold. Decent stuff.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
2834,"2016-08-30",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2017 Pilsner glass, 10.482 oz. Ladies and gentlemen, we have an expert pilsner here. The appearance is pale yellow and clear with a tall, frothy head looking like whipped cream. The nose is absolutely immaculate. I dont have the words for how clean and genuine this smells. Beautiful, light pilsner malt with woody, spicy hops. No esters of any kind in the aroma. The palate is lively and crisp with a bone dry finish. The hop bitterness and flavor is pristine, giving a peppery bite over the smooth, doughy, malts. As far as this style goes, this is perfect execution and an absolute delight to drink. Now well sit back and wait for everyone on Ratebeer to trash it.

On tap at the brewery. Again. I find myself drinking this beer a lot. Ive noticed lately the malt is a little more prominent, it used to be arguably drier and lighter. But still, its crisp and dry. The pilsner malt shines through perfectly with distinct peppery hops. Theres a distinct minerally quality to it which takes it to the next level. If youre looking for a clean, simple pilsner, this is basically perfection. Id also like to note that I was wrong in my prediction for negative reviews on this site.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
