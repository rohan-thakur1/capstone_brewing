3937,"2016-03-23",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed this baby at a line share at Witchs Hat on St. Pattys Day. 750 mL bottle. No idea who poured it, but Abu came by to share it. Thanks man! The pour is a chunky and silty yellow orange color with a thin off white colored head that fades to a ring. The aroma is pretty good. There is a tart apricot juice right up front before it fades into a solid funk. There is a mustiness present, and a little citrus zest. The flavor is much of the same. Its really juicy and enjoyable. There is a solid juiciness to it, but the crisp tartness and enjoyable funkiness really bring this one together nicely. Basic and not overly complex, but well executed. The mouth feel is a little heavier and juicy, with a nice crisp carbonation and a lingeringly juicy, funky, tart apricot aftertaste. The more I get to drink these, the more I realize that I love peach and apricot anythings ha.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3937,"2016-02-06",4.0,"750 ml bottle to stemmed wine glass (shared with the Mrs.). Looks good; a very cloudy (juicy) apricot with ample eggshell head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells good too; tart and mildly funky alongside a nice semi-sweet apricot presence. Tastes like it smells with a pleasantly juice-like medium-bodied mouthfeel. Some mild wheat on the tongue as well.

Bright orange, moderately hazy, small white head. Tart apricots, unicorns, rainbows. Incredibly drinkable and full flavored. Awesome sauce. If you see this, buy it.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
3937,"2015-12-25",3.6,"Shared 750 ml. bottle poured to snifters, displaying a cloudy, orangey color, with soft white head foam that quickly diminished to a light ring, no film, and light lacing. The nose was light yeastiness, soft wheat, and a combination of mimosa & stone fruit, with light tartness. Light to medium bodied, the taste was similar, with a bit more expression to the tartness, made available by the accompanying lively & spritzy carbonation. Sessionably refreshing.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
3937,"2015-12-25",4.0,"On draught
Pours a hazy yellow with a small head that fades out fairly quickly.

The aroma is bright apricot with a nice mild yougurty twang. The aroma is pleasant & inviting, its very fruit forward without being especially sweet smelling. 

The flavor is bright, just all sorts of BRIGHT! Its got a bunch of apricot fruitiness, its very tart, its very dry. ITs got a load of lemon and citrus zest. Its got a pretty decent wallop of sourness without crossing any sort of unpleasant threshold. 

good stuff.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
3937,"2015-12-20",3.8,"750 ml bottle sampled at Marks gigantic tasting alongside Fou Foune, which really was never a fair fight. Pours a hazy gold with no head. Very nice stone fruit characteristics, with apricot and peach, along with yogurt, sourdough, lactic funk, and cheesecloth. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a funky, tart, fruity mouthfeel. Really nice, understated apricot Berliner.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3937,"2015-12-13",4.0,"759 ml waxed bottle. Big wax. Pours hazy orange. Carbonation fades. Lots of apricots and tartness. Weiss is deceptive because there is much more going on there with the fruits and tartness. This is really tasty.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"

3937,"2015-11-10",4.0,"Sampled at the Bottleworks, it poured a hazy orange amber colour with sudsy but short-lived white foam. Crisp, grainy, pleasantly acidic. Not merely tart but full-on sour, in a good way. True-to-style Berliner Weiss traits plus harmonious apricot. Light body, intense champagne-like carbonation with a similar metallic bite, lingering fruity, sparkling lemonade aftertaste. Extremely tasty, but I doubt Id ever pay $18+ for a bottle of session beer.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

3937,"2015-11-06",3.6,"Draft at Cuginos. Lots of haze in this oranges gold beer. A nice fruity aroma includes those apricots. This is tart and very fruity. It tastes of apricots but more, too. Melons at the finish and citrus throughout. Yeast and just a little earth. A little funk. Tasty stuff.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
3937,"2015-11-04",3.4,"On tap at the Tap Room. It poured a yellow/gold color with a small white head. The aroma was of funk, spices, wheat and some yogurt. The taste was similar to the aroma with more spices, yogurt, tartness, cheese, lemon peel and more funkiness. Very different, but tasty.","Wentzville, Missouri, USA","jandd1983"
3937,"2015-10-30",3.8,"On tap at The Tap Room - Pours milky orange with a white head. The aroma has rich juicy apricots, very fruity and not really tart on the nose. Comes across like a fruit puree exclusively. It has a medium body with some heft and richness with tingly carbonation. The flavor starts with peppery spice, lots of apricots, citrus and wild yeast sourness. The finish gets more sour, but still has heavy fruit. The warmer it gets the more the sour takes over the fruit parts. Very good, but Im not sure its worth the ultra premium price tag on it. Guess they feel they are missing out on that trend going on now.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
