Color is dark garnet, and the aroma brings the hard candy, sour funk that I expect. Sweet and sour, but the sourness is foremost. The tart cherry flavor is supported by a good malt backbone, making the body lively, yet controlled. A pretty good sour brown that is worth a try, and perhaps look for in the future.","","balloonbuffoon"

3430,"2015-03-09",4.5,"12 oz bottle, poured into a tulip glass at approximately 40 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a deep, dark ruddy brown, with a head that dissipates rather quickly.

Smell: Balsamic vinegar notes waft out of the glass first, of course, followed by notes of cherry and sweet caramel. Faint hints of something akin to hardwood also come along for the ride.

Taste: Now thats a good, approachable, fruity oud bruin. Sour vinegar strikes first, overlaying every other aspect of the taste with its essence. Cherry and berry flavors dance to the balsamic tune, occasionally forming some hints of currant and plum, while sweet caramel plays a soft counterpoint in the background.

Only thing I can think is this was bottled late December, 2008.

A: Pours a rosey orange ale with excellent clarity and a transient single finger tan head. Rings of lacing. Sheet of light tan head.

S: cherries, allspice, clove, the cherries remind me of a cherry jolly rancher or some cough syrup. Just a hint of vanilla stemming from the oak.

T: Cherries, oak, yeast. Semi-tart up front with plenty of sweetness through the center. The fruit has taken on plenty of mineral-like flavors. Meh. Tastes like mulled wine.

M: Light syrup feel with low carbonation. Finish is slightly cloying but short lived. 

O: Plenty fruity, but pretty much ends up tasting mulled wine. Probably would be good served warm.

3430,"2013-08-14",3.6,"2012 bottle.Aroma is fairly fruity with some cherries and tart berries, but the most dominant aroma is oak and its characteristics - faint vanilla but more smokey. Not much malt character to the aroma, more a bit stale than I expected.Pours a slightly cloudy amber brown with some red highlights. Small, moderately thick head that recedes to the edges very quickly. Flavor is a balanced blend of fruit and oak with a light acidity. Slight sweetness upfront with some cherry syrup notes. The sweet cherries are balanced with the oak adding a light smokiness. The oak flavor is more similar to fresh cut oak than cured oak so I don?t pick up much vanilla. Faint bitterness and a touch of a red apple flavor.Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Low acidic astringency with low alcohol warmth. Overall an alright beer, but I expected more from this bottle. The malt character is mostly faded and stale and the aroma is dominated by fresh oak notes.

Im not getting oak or vanilla or smoke. Crazy though that theres this much flavor in a 5.5% ABV beer. It really bugs me when brewers re-brand the same recipe under a different label. Although it appears they kept the name ""Enigma"", the fact that it was Enigma Unplugged originally and is now part of the Thumbprint series makes it appear that its somehow different. Thats fine if you want to do that, just make it clear in the description on the bottle that it was previously sold under the Unplugged series.

Fairly complex and highly drinkable for a sour. Very well-balanced - doesnt try to knock your socks off with sourness, but instead goes for a restrained sourness balanced sufficiently with fruity sweetness.

3430,"2012-09-19",4.5,"Returns a King! Enigma is back for the fall of 2012 following a brewing in 2010 and 2006 under New Glarus now defunct Unplugged Series label. Im always psyched to see a New Glarus beer make a return that I never got a chance to try before it sold out in stores. 

It starts off with a clear, reddish/orange color with only a slight head. The scent is sweet yet sour to the nose as it picks up hints of yeast, cherry, and other fruity scents. A very strong and yet intriguing smell.

In the realm of Sour Ales, this one is pretty tame to the taste buds. The texture is smooth and easy drinking. There is a bold sweet and sour flavor that makes this beer taste great! Im not really sure if this is a beer or a little piece of heaven in my pint glass as it makes for a rather complex taste indeed, well deserving of the name Enigma. 

Yeah, its pretty awesome guys! The Sour Ale is not a widely made beer, but when its done well its delicious. Overall this is good beginner level Sour Ale as there are far stronger sours on the market. Being a 90s kid, sours always have a place in my heart as they remind me of a Sour Apple Warhead that was so popular when I was a kid.

A: Orange hue with a thin beige head that barely leaves any lacing.

S: Cherries, oak, Flanders oud bruin?

T: From the first sip, this immediately tastes like a New Glarus beer. Its too sweet. I was really hoping that this would walk the sweet / sour tightrope, but it heavily favors the sweet side. Cherries with hints of oak make up the bulk of the taste. The taste itself seems confused and trapped between styles. It has elements of a Flanders oud bruin and a sweet NG fruit beer, but turns out to be neither. Its not bad or wrong because it doesnt fit perfectly into a style, it just doesnt taste that great.

The mouth is firm, slightly wet, but filling enough. Carbonation level is spot on for a fruit beer. Lightly spritzy, but not overly so.

The look: Partly cloudy golden-red body topped by a small beige head.  Nice shinny color
In long: Rather un-sour nose with sweet apples, cranberries and vanilla.  Taste is sweet cranberry juice, sweet red apples, liquorices, vanilla, light notes of maraschino cherries,  spices (nutmeg, cloves, etc.).  I remember the original release of this beer being more of an approximation of a Flemish sour.  This beer is a not-style spicy sweet fruit beers with a little cherry tartness here and there.  Not much of a sour ale.  So how does it fare as a fruit beer?  Ok I guess.  I first had it when it was very fresh after the release and the spices were too prominent.  Now the beer has settled down but it is still not something I enjoyed very much.  I dont understand the ratebeer Sour/Wild classification on this beer.  This is not a Sour/Wild.

Pour yields a brew with a dark bronze color and a really good white head. Moderate lacing as it goes down. The nose is smells of slight oxidation, though it fits with the cherry. Theres also some mild oak and some lightly-sweet bready malt. Cherry comes back through, especially as it warms. The flavor hits notes of cherry with a bit of oak and light vanilla. A light touch of acid, though not much. The sourness is mostly confined to the finish. Pretty good, though not as good as their standard fruit offerings.

3430,"2011-03-06",3.1,"2010 version. Says its a fruit beer on here, not sure if it is a full blown fruit beer.

It pours into my chalice a vibrant reddish orange. It has a decent white head that quickly recedes it leaves a bit of lacing.

The smell is very oaky, for some reason the oak scents in New Glarus beers are a bit more blunt than other beers. There is a light fruity character, but no sourness.

This is a very sweet beer, almost cloying. It is fruity but not overly so. It has a nice sourness. Over all this is the oak which again, is blunt. I dont know if it is the barrels but the oaky New Glarus products just seem off for some reason to me.

This really reminds me of Monks cafe which I find a terrible representation of the style, this one like that one is just too sweet and the oak just doesnt meld properly.

3430,"2011-01-22",3.7,"Bottle and served in Bells snifter, tasted next to my last bottle of the 2006 version: Pours a reddish amber hue with a fading fizzy head and minimal lace. The aroma has notes of wild and tart cherries, red wine vinegar, vanilla bean, French oak tannins, and some Cinnamon and herbal spices. So far the two are strikingly similar, perhaps the 2006 is a tad darker and a bit more forceful on the nose but I am picking up the exact same esters and vapours in them both.  The taste starts with some tart and sweet cherries, even some cassis along with layers of vanilla toned oak and Cinnamon like spice. Hint of pale biscuit and caramel malts here and there. The tannic nature of the 2010 seems more upfront than in the 2006 and the 2010 is far less acidic nor tart. The mouth feel is medium-bodied with a slight slickness and dry oaky finish. A bit under carbonated if you ask me. Final verdict: While this latest version of the Unplugged Enigma is still a nice brew that I would gladly try again it is still far less interesting a sour ale than the original Enigma which I had rated a 4.1 back in May 5, 2007.

3430,"2010-10-14",3.0,"5.5%, 2010 Bottling; Sampled October 2010
A vigorous pour fills my 25cl tulip glass to the rim with an amber tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is a deep red color that shows an almost clear, cranberry red color when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of richly caramelized sugars, a wisp of smokiness, brown-sugar coated toasty grain and a sourness.  The end has an interesting mix of sourness and almost cinnamon like sweetness that is really quite loud smelling at times.  The nose is actually too sweet smelling, it might be able to pull it off if it was a bit more complex.  The nose makes me think this is a sweet desert beer of some sort and now I am curious if the flavor follows suit (though I really hope not).

The beer is not nearly as sweet smelling as the nose suggested and now I get it, that boosted sweetness / spice character in the nose was coming from some barrel aging; ample vanillin and a big toasted coconut flavor sweetly spice the flavor of this beer.  This beer does have some sweetness to it, this is evenly balanced by the lactic tartness that is found in this beer.  While the sweetness is perhaps a touch to much for my preferences, the tartness is not anywhere near noticeable enough; especially with the big, smooth oak character and supporting sweetness this beer could have used a whole lot more lactic sourness.  As with a lot of New Glaruss beers, this is quite clean and approaches being too simplistic; this can be ok in something like a Pale Ale, but a sour really should have some wildness and funkiness besides the clean lactic character that is in this beer.  The combination of the sweetness, the vanillin and the coconut as well as the light tartness makes this beer seem quite fruity tasting; it reminds me of berries, or really cherries (hmm after checking the label there actually are some cherries added to this).

After realizing the oak presence in the flavor, it is now quite apparent in the nose with lots of layered vanillin and a solid, but strikingly fruity coconut character that almost dominates the nose.  The body is somewhat full for a beer of this strength, but not overly so, but it definitely clings to the palate a fair amount. 

The oak really saves this beer from being overly simplistic and clean.  This is a nicely drinkable beer; it is quite approachable and is a great beer for those that are used to the likes of Lindemans but are looking for a bit less of the cloying sweetness.  While this is not a bad beer I am finding myself deeply disappointed that this beer is not more interesting; it is actually quite surprising how clean this beer is considering the label says that it is spontaneously fermented.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3430,"2010-10-01",3.5,"12 oz bottle courtesy fantomas23. This one pours a mostly cloudy reddish amber color and topped by a smooth head of beige colored foam. The aroma isnt what I remember from the original version. Notes of sweet-tart cherries, apple cider, spices, and some sweet vanilla from the oak push through in the aroma. A otuch of lactic acidity creeps through as well. The flavor follows suit with the tart cherries and apples up front followed by plenty of spices that suggest at clove and anise. Some lactic yeast pushes through to add some tartness, but clean cereal grain malt and vanilla from the oak add sweetness to the fold. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and some residual sugars that linger in the finish. This version is a little sweet and on the spicy side for me. A little let down from the previous version. Maybe this one still some more time in the bottle.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

Still lovely in the appearance (a weathered looking reddish brown), nose (that delectable barrel character familiar from many NG beers, along with a heady mix of tart fruit and vanilla), and the superbly complex flavors. Nice to try it fairly young too, albeit with a tweaked recipe. The yeast isnt necessarily understated, but hasnt quite suffused the beer yet.

Pours a bright, lightly hazy, ruby-tinged orange color (somewhere between amber and orange); thin, fine-bubbled off-white head with excellent lacing; dig the color on this. The aroma shows mouthwatering tart cherries, creamy oak (plenty of vanilla), and strawberry fruit leather; hints of cinnamon and spice (presumably from the barrel); dense, lush, modestly tart aroma with excellent details. Medium body; average carbonation; quite creamy, with nothing rough here; following the aroma, the lightly tart cherries, red fruits, modest citrus, and hugely charismatic oak notes come together nicely: reasonable acidity, nice citrusy note at the tip of the tongue, lively and light enough to down quickly; very well-presented, highly oaked sour ale (though not particularly sour); the sour brown characterization is vaguely apt, but there arent any darker malts or major sweet and sour notes here; nicely toasty, tart, and drinkable, with more a concentration on red fruits than traditional sour browns. Tasty stuff. Glad to see Dan turning down the alcohol on this and zeroing it in. Pretty much just as good as the original, in my mind, if not better (my scores from before might be higher, but my scales shifted a bit in the meanwhile).

3430,"2010-09-09",4.2,"I picked this up while visiting the New Glarus brewery, enjoyed while watching opening night of the 2010 NFL season.  I didnt know what to expect out of this one.  Aroma wise, the vanilla is very prevalent along with a hint of cherries and sour notes with smoke, unlike anything Ive ever smelled.  Appearance just looks rich, like a cherry amber with a pronounced head.  Taste really threw me off.  This is some sour stuff, and I wasnt expecting it.  I didnt think it would be a sour ale upon aroma and appearance.  After a couple of sips, the smokiness really becomes known, along with some dark fruits.  Carbonation is actually more than any other sour Ive tried, and the mouthfeel at first really sucks any moisture from your cheeks, its like you have to drink this without letting it get into your cheeks to really appreciate it.  This really is unlike anything Ive ever tried, and while Im impressed Im not sure if Im really a fan of it or not.  Definitely a truly unique brew, should really be tried by anyone out there.

After getting towards the end of this one, I find my appreciation for it growing with every sip and Ive got to increase my rating.  The warmer it gets, the more the cherries become pronounced.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"

3430,"2010-09-02",3.4,"12oz. bottle, courtesy juiceisloose.  The pour yields a mostly clean, rusty red-amber tinted body with a moderate, fluffy head of beige froth.  Collapsing to just a thin film, the head gives some spotted lacing on the glass.  Having had prior versions of Enigma, the aroma on this one isnt what I expected at all.  Apple cider with mulling spices immediately strikes the nose, followed by fruity notes of sweet-tart cherries and a good bit of sweet vanilla.  Soft lactic acidity creeps in, lending a tart but creamy effect, as subtle hints of barrel toast and some cereal grain round things out.  Flavors follow suit, again quite spicy, suggesting allspice, clove, and star anise amidst mildly tart cherry-apple and and lactic yeast.  The cereal grain and the vanilla bring sweetness, too much for my liking, in fact.  On the palate, moderate carbonation pushes around the sweet, medium body, while residual sugars bunch up and linger on the lips after the finish.  Overall, I found this to be a bit of a disappointment.  Ill have to open my last bottle of 2005-06 Enigma to compare in the present day, but I remember liking that one a heck of alot more.

Fairly sweet with a good malty base.  Oak barrel, vanilla, and butteriness (but not too much of this) add complexity.  Medium-bodied and a little more watery than Id like, but this is only a minor drawback.  Good carbonation level.  An unsurprisingly good cherry beer.

Flavor is oak, vanilla and smoke up front, giving way to sweet cherries, vinegar, slightly sweet cereal, grass and floral notes. Palate is light bodied, creamy on entry, immediately followed by an explosion of carbonation (probably a little too high, but it dies down after a little swirling, or a few minutes) and ending with a lightly dry, crisp finish.

Aromas are some pungent sour cherries, a touch of sweetness, caramel and toffee malts, a touch of vinegar acidity, lactic sourness, brett, wet oak and vanilla mix with a touch of cough syrup which is probably the only detractor. Sour cherry tannins. Caramel and toffee, especially wheat bread move forward behind the sourness. Initial is medium bodied, a nice kick of sour cherries and lactic acid, light balsamic vinegar grows, decent acidity, wey oak and vanilla tannins towards the back. Caramel, toffee, wheat bread, some biscuits, vanilla compose sweetness, some more cherry of sweet and tart varieties. Funky bretty is light, but a bit stinky on the palate, the crisp maltiness still comes through though. A touch of smokiness, the acidity gives ground to richer malts, vanilla tannins and rich oak. A decent infection, decent sourness and telltale funkiness towards the finish as mellow sweetness, tart cherries, and light maltiness stick.

I did not realize this was considering a new release until I was skimming the New Glarus page in preparation for the Great Taste of the Midwest. Once I found that out I rushed to open what I knew would be a great beer. Not disappointed in the least this is a slightly lower key version of previous batches. It is hard to do a side by side since the other has a few years on it now but both are excellent semi-tart beers perfect for any occasion.

Aroma / Appearance - The caramel brown head bubbled for a few minutes before the short lived head collapsed. Slightly more fluid than the older batch it slides like silk fabric. Cherries dipped in cheap chocolate and tart sugar accent the nose which is very inviting. It is hard to believe this is 5.5% from the aroma.

Flavor / Palate - Caramel, cherry cordial and oak slide gracefully along the senses like two experienced dance partners on the open floor. The finish is somehow a bit salty. I wish I had more than just a single bottle left at this point because this one will be good for a year or so to come I suspect. Of course I am sure the next release will be no slouch either.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
3430,"2010-08-13",4.2,"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle.

Pours a ruby copper with a small head that recedes quickly to a ring. 

Aroma is up front light malt and cherries. Middle yields to a light smoke with a touch of pound cake aromas. Finishes with an oakey funk of yeast. The aroma is up front and you dont have to search for it.

Flavor opens with a blast of sour yeast and cherries. The cherry flavor, like the Belgian Red is fresh, tart and not at all contrived or fake. Middle brings cracker grain and snappy yeast sourness, malt roast is reminiscent of the Olde English Porter in roasty bitterness, although this is quite light. Finishes slightly dry with a touch of spice and a nice tang. Very tasty.

Mouthfeel is thin and very well carbonated to hold up to the sweetness. The carbonation is head on the nail perfect.

This, like the Olde English is a flanders more, fruit beer less.

Aroma is really big on raw, toasted oak, vanilla, wood chips, cherry, a little smoke, a little booze.  Flavor is sweet, cherries, vanilla, light wood, malts, sugar, a little yeast, a little peach.  The flavor doesnt have nearly as much oak as the nose would lead you to believe.  The finish is lightly watery and a touch thin.  Id like to see them bump the flavor on this a touch.

The aroma opened with a lovely impression from ripe cherries, lactic sourness, and oak, backed by more robust cherry meat (dancing around being sweet, but not quite getting there), vanilla, and rum..decadent and well-balanced.  The flavor opened with tart cherries, oak, and milky sourness, backed promptly by candied cherry meat and bright, dry fruity yeast.. dried out greatly on the back-end, leaving a whole lot of barrel impression.. tasty stuff!

I mean come on - Cran-bic, Cherry Stout, Enigma...Re-rate 2015 edition....very vinous nose.  Get a lot of pear and to much lesser extent dark cherry.  A bit of green apple and fruit skins.

The flavor is lightly sour with apple cider, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, oak, and a touch of sour berries. The palate is full and malty with lively carbonation.

3430,"2010-07-12",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2017 [Bottle] Pours ruby-amber with a quickly disappearing light tan head. Aroma is immediately cherries up front, then oak, vanilla, and faint spices (cinnamon and nutmeg). Taste is slightly tart, cherry again taking the lead, with notes of cocoa, barley and cherry skin at the end. Almost a pumpkin-like quality at times (which Guerde pointed out). Medium mouthfeel, smooth, and has a long finish where the tannins really come out. Another beautifully unique creation from New Glarus that is like dessert in a glass. I just wish that this became a regular so I could drink it all the time.Re-rate: Last bottle, and I still love it. Im bumping the score up a couple of points. Great beer that I hope that they make again.Re-rate: 2015 Bottle. Still very solid--lots of cherry, but the finish is below average. Not as tart as I remember, and the oak sometimes clashes with the other flavors. I still like it, but it falls short of the 4.5 I gave the beer previously.Old rating: 9/4/8/4/17=4.2 Updated: Back to dialed-in with this 2017 batch. Spectacular balance of tart cherry and oak.

The aroma is of charred oak and cherry tart. The taste is dry with a nice balance of the tart, oak and cherry flavors. This one is not as wicked as some other sours but more balanced and enjoyable. I love that the tart cherry taste lingers for quite some time. This is one complex and enjoyable sour ale.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","hombrepalo"

The nose is great though w/assertive sourness, cherry, a hint of vanilla and coconut. Mild sweetness is balanced by tartness. This provides some very deep, rich barrel character while still being drinkable and w/o being watery. This is an impressive feat of brewing if you ask me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

I was ready to group it with the Cherry Stout and Belgian Red, but theres a sour undercurrent to this that helps to combat the sweetness I associate with those beers. Lots of other flavor notes, like some vanilla, some smoke, some hops, etc., make this one definitely worth your while.","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"

Flavor is similar to the nose, and I can see why it is called enigma.  It is not necessarily a sour, it is not a fruit beer, it is difficult to classify, but it is fruity, slightly sour, and very good.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

The second is whatever the most recent batch was.  Pours a clear ruby copper brown with a thin white head.  Medium bodied, cherries, hints of sourness.  Smooth and sweet.  Light sweetness and a nice tang.  The newer bottle was nice, but lacked the complexity of the older one.  Not sure if thats a recipe change, or just the fact that the age on the old one added some deep fruit and velvety mouthfeel.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

Flavor is a bit tart but not at all overpoweringly puckering, more cherry notes.  The finish brings the cherries to the front and is very smooth.  Great intro for those not wanting to jump into the deep end of the sour category....","New Hope, Minnesota, USA","13mikey"
3430,"2010-06-27",4.3,"Aroma:The nose is full of cherry an oak. The smell is sugary sweet.

Appearance:Its the reddish-brown color of spiced rum. Poor head retention.

Taste:Theres a lot of cherry flavor in the foretaste, plus a little sourness imparted by the wild yeast. This changes to oak and vanilla in the midtaste. For the first few sips, there was a lot of copper in the aftertaste, but this went away the more I drank.

Palate:Lots of carbonation on the tongue, and its a little harsh on the back of my throat as I swallow.

Overall:This is a delicious fruit beer that gives you a lot of cherry flavor. While you drink this beer, complex flavors arise on every sip.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","fear025"

As for the flavor, this was a delightful guessing game. Some earthiness from the smoke, some sweetness from caramel and coconut, some tartness with the raspberry and strawberry notes, and some warming bourbon. By the end, I was tasting a blend of coconut cream cake covered with sliced strawberries placed by a man smoking a pipe. This beer rocks my brain.

But those lovely cherries are still there and well-integrated into the rest of the nose that boast smooth, sweet vanilla, and light oak. Taste is overripe cherries with balsamic vinegar over a layer of vanilla, brown sugar, and the cherries making a comeback on the finish. Smooth, velvety, and medium bodied. This takes the best parts of my favorite NG fruit beers and melds them with flavors I love. I would love to see a bit more sourness, but the balsamic vinegar is pleasant. Im absolutely blown away.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

Oak and dusty notes follow with a little vanilla in the background.  Sweet creamy malt lends support the whole way through.  Sour and papery in the finish.  Not nearly as tart or sour as expected though.  A lot of fruit beer in this, which considering who brews this, thats not a bad thing.  Extremely easy drinking.  A good first sour for someone but I wouldnt mind a little more intensity to it.  Still this is a very good beer.

Flavor was quite complex and slightly more sour than an Oud Brune, but amazingly complex and well blended! The sourness was strong, but carefully countered by the cherries, somewhat sweet malt, earthiness, some barn characters, and a slight amount of old cheese.
