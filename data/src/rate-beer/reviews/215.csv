215,"2015-09-24",3.2,"355ml bottle. Pretty clear pale golden color, large frothy/foamy head. Aroma is very basic making quite true to style, bread notes, light hearbs, hay must, and vague tartness. Flavor is a bit soapier, maltier, dryer, and hoppier than the typical koelsch, in fact quite bitter. Decent brew aimed at US palates.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

215,"2015-07-26",3.6,"Kölsch is one of those niche styles Ive been trying to appreciate in recent years, but havent really found any that have amazed me. Most tend to taste fine and drink pretty easy, much like Victory Kühl Kölsch. 

I poured a 12oz bottle into a pilsner glass. It had an enjoy by date of 9/9/15.

Appearance: Pure golden color with near crystal clarity. Slow, fine carbonation can be seen drifting up. Pours to a fairly large, white, frothy head which retains and laces pretty well.

Smell: Light pale malt scent plus mineral water. Perhaps a hint of fruit. Otherwise mild.

Taste: Ive really come to appreciate the pilsner style, so itd seem like Kölsch would be right up my alley since theyre quite similar. This beer has a pretty simple recipe of only pilsner and wheat and two Noble hops and the palette certainly conveys this. Light lager-like taste up front with only the faintest bready character. Through the middle I detect a light spicy sensation from the hops, but it is not particularly bitter. The finish is a bit odd with a bit of a biscuit flavor and what seems like very hard water due to a high mineral content. Not much going on here aside from this, but I can dig it.

Drinkability: At only 4.9% ABV, Victory Kühl Kölsch is a relatively light beer and drinks as such. The mouthfeel is crisp and thin with a very smooth finish. There is some lingering aftertaste of wheat, though. Refreshing while in the mouth, but not especially lively while in it. A fine summertime beer.

Score: 7/10","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Aroma is of bready malts, pils malts, floral hops, light grassy hops, light pine, and some light spicy hops. Taste is about the same as the aroma with the addition of some light citrus fruitiness and cracker sweet malts. Has a medium-light body with a semi creamy mouthfeel and a semi dry, slightly bitter, medium finish.

215,"2015-07-01",4.1,"From a 12 oz onto a glass. Pours a very light straw color with a wee bit o frothy white head. Tangy aroma. Mouthfeel is light and slightly biting. Taste is grassy hops lemon and some other stuff that's kind of earthy. Lots of flavor and easy to drink. Slightly dirty tasting but that's very minor. Damn good beer.
