Sweet and smokey nose, with a mellow seabuckthorn-like acidity, some fragrant wood (hints of white oak?), smoked meats, berries, caramel. The front is nice, with some juicy, mildly tart berries, some sweet malt, smoked dried wood and grain. Some caramel crust, dried grass, mild hay, with a nice juniper fragrance developing, nice and sharp, reminding me of gin. Some bitterness, woody in nature, with a lot more smoke in the finish, but not the bacony one usually found in rauchbiers. A stronger, burnt, ashy kind, dry and rugged. Some bit of caramel and that gin note lingers, too. Medium body and carbonation. A tiny bit of warm alcohol.

Super że jałowiec wyraźnie tu czuć, bo często to dodatek jakiegoś składnika znajduje się tylko w postaci napisu na etykiecie. Ten jałowiec, jak ktoś nie zna można by ewentualnie porównać do czerwonej borówki lub jarzębiny. Jest też troszkę karmelu z podbudowy słodowej, są rodzynki. Wędzoność jak dla mnie idealna, bo delikatna i zbalansowana, podbija tylko bogaty i ciekawy smak. Dla mnie rewelacja. Nie odstraszy ona nikogo od piwa, nawet wrogów wędzonych aromatów i smaków. Na finiszu mamy przyjemną, średnią goryczkę przywodzącą na myśl igły sosny i cierpkie, mięsiste, gorzkawe owoce- znów jałowiec.

Smoke definitely leads the way here, but it doesnt overwhelm the sweet caramel and floral aromas - think smokey bacon and youre not far off. There is a subtle juniper presence coming through as a bright sharpness in the aroma and a mild spiciness on the tongue, but I think Id prefer a little more emphasis there. The body is surprisingly light, driven by a lively sustained carbonation, which I think prevents the smoke from building and lingering more than it does. Quite pleasant and approachable for a smoked beer, and reminiscent of Aecht Schlenkerla rauchbier, but definitely not everybodys cup of tea. (14/20)","CANADA","UXO"

There's also a hint of herbs, licorice and roasted whole grains. The palate is almost more smoky than the nose. Medium bodied, fairly well balanced with a touch of sweetness and acidity.

Balancing feel, roasted and fruity at the same time, suitable carbonation, good body.
Finishes with more of the malts, sour caramel, warming, dark bread.
Overall pleasant, quite good to spicy dishes I assume.

Aroma is fairly smokey with nice juniper note but not much malt character. Light sweet caramel note with hints of toffee.
Pours a dark copper with some light brown and ruby highlights. Light tan head of moderate retention but it recedes steadily. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor is slightly sweet upfront but then the smoke hits to mellow out the sweetness. Light toffee and caramel notes with hints of raisin and other fruit. Juniper is light and the finish has just a hint of acidity. Light bitterness to help balance the sweetness. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency an low alcohol warmth. 
Overall an alright beer and fairly unique. The smoke and juniper are well balanced but with the age the malt character has kind of faded out. The light acidity is nice an doesn't overwhelms but instead only adds a touch of tartness in the background.

2567,"2013-01-30",3.3,"500 mil bottle from Bieropholie, served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass. Clear deep ruby-copper with a nice light tan head. Meat smoke that is kept in check by rich, caramel/toffee maltiness, some nice fruitiness, not getting any juniper, campfire, I like it. Medium+ body with soft, somewhat sparse effervescence. Less smoke than the nose, more frity and less caramel/toffee, a bit of old apple juice, not quite as interesting as the aroma; dry with limited bitterness and a fairly long, kinda fruity and slightly weak finish with only a touch of smoke. Strong start, less strong finish.","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"

Taste is smokey, some brown sugar, a bit of fruit, some vanillas. What makes this beer wonderful, aside from having been brewed by Haandbryggeriet, is the specificity of the smoke. This isnt a big, overpowering bacony smoke, but a wonderful, aromatic, wood fire smoke. Its like this beer came straight off of the fire. Again, excellent.","Highland Heights, Kentucky, USA","Chuckaduck"
2567,"2013-01-14",3.7,"(50 cl bottle) Hazy, brown beer with a creamy yellow(ish) head and some chunky sediment. Aroma is moderately smoky, along with licorice, woo, moss. The juniper berries are present, but less dominant than expected, and seem to bring a more fruity touch to the whole thing. Still makes associate pinewood forests and heathlands. Nearly burnt sugar. Medium bitterness, slightly sweet and sour. Medium bodied, soft to medium carbonation. Almost creamy texture. Overall a good mouthfeel. Well balanced, alcohol well-hidden. Complex enough, but not too exhausting/demanding. Recommended!","GERMANY","brugmanneke"

2567,"2013-01-05",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2013 Orange, cloudy, tan head. Aroma of grainy malt, moderate smoke, fresh-baked dark bread, light leather note.

Only the barest hint of juniper--wouldnt notice if I hadnt read that its in there. It contributes a subtle note to a very nice interesting beer.

Pours dark amber with huge amounts of lively carbonation that leaves a 1 finger light brown head. 
Smells smoked, woody smoke and not the smoked meat/ham that some smoked beers have. In addition to the smoke it has sweet, piny notes, some caramel and malt.
Smooth mouth feel. Taste is smoky though the smoke does not take over hand as sweet, caramel taste is there as well. Some earthy notes which probably comes from the juniper berries.

2567,"2012-07-24",3.7,"A: This beer appears a medium to light copper hue with orange highlights. Upon popping the cap, the beer begins to ooze foam like a slow erupting volcano. The massive head eventually subsides, leaving a very stubborn 1/4 inch head with long lasting retention, yet no lacing.

S: A really complex aroma consisting of smoke, chocolate, candy, butterscotch, roasted malt, toffee.

T: The aroma is an accurate indicator of what flavors one might expect from this smoked beer. The smoke flavor is certainly apparent, though not as heavily pronounced as in most rauch beers. Overall, the beer is a bit sweet, with a tasty blend of butterscotch candies, toffee, and chocolate. The juniper berries are undoubtedly responsible for the floral / herbal flavors that contribute to the growing sweetness.

M: medium body with a sweet, somewhat sticky feel.

2567,"2011-09-04",3.4,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2015 Its January, Im cross country skiing in the Norwegian mountains, its cold, windy and snowing, but Im warm, due to my newly lit campfire. This high in the mountains its hard to find good, dry firewood, but some semi-dry pine branches with the needles still on do the job. The sour smoke aroma from the wet wood and the subtle resiny smoky notes from the burning pine needles mix with the smell of the sausages Im grilling. This is exactly what a Norwegian Wood smells like. Or, to be more precise, this is what a Norwegian Wood smells like 30 seconds after its been poured: in a freshly poured pint sweet fruity notes and sweet caramel dominate, but this initial aroma dies out quite rapidly and gives way to the smoky part. In addition I get tar, oil and wood. An unusual, complex and exciting aroma! The brew looks rather dull: a cloudy, medium amber to brown body, with a small off-white head that reduces to a thin layer very quickly, poor lacing. The taste is light sweet, light sour and the finish is medium bitter. A very long-lasting, medium bitter, smoky aftertaste. The flavours follow the aroma. Even though the smoke is the backbone of this ale, its never too much, its never intrusive, but its a mellow, nice and gentle smokiness. Pleasant mouthfeel with a medium body and soft to medium carbonation. A nice and exciting beer, Im glad Ive got one more in my beer cellar. So yes, John, I agree, Norwegian Wood is good.

The nose is a little hard to detect through the head, but there is certainly a strong smoke aroma, mixed with a touch of gin and some honey sweetness. The taste of this beer, it must be said, is a touch unusual. Mildly spicy hops mingle with dry gin to start, moving into a drying, smoky body, which lingers into the finish, mixing with more gin to create an odd, but very pleasant, end to the beer. This is most certainly one of the most different beers I have encountered. Its combination of dry gin and woody, smoky malt is closer in flavour to jenniver than to anything else I have encountered, so it certainly is unusual.

2567,"2011-07-13",3.6,"Poured out a medium amber brew, clear, with what appears to a off white cap (poor lighting here) and tiny spots. The aroma is interesting and sneaky: woody, sweet, I havent had Golden Grahams for years but this reminds me of what I remember it smelt like eons ago, well worn leather, chocolate, smooth smoky malts and light complimentary juniper spice. Unique yet not overly impressive for whatever reason. Good taste that never lets down and this beer is growing on me more and more. The subdued flavour selection is what is winning me over. Light, soft smoke and related malts, sweetness revolving around some fruit I guess (oooooo surprise), hops that take stabs at me just after mid sip, hints of alcohol if I try hard enough to find it, caramel.. cant think of anything else. Excellent carbonation. The only down side to this offering is that fact that I am repeatedly reminded of the weak 6.5% alcohol. Hops on the finish. Deserves a higher mark. I like the quietness of this brew. And the belches are of the highest quality of taste. Im drunk. The original idea here was to put this head to head against Schlenkerkekkrkerilallla Marzen but after drinking most of the Marzen and being reminded how totally awesome it is makes this comparison is totally pointless. Good beer but overpriced in this market.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"
2567,"2011-07-11",3.5,"Draft pours hazy reddish-brown with rich 2 finger head.  Aroma is smoke, bacon, foresty spice, and juniper.  Tastes like smoke, barrel, salt, and spice but in no way overwhelming like the smell would lead you to believe.  There is surprising balance between the smoke character, the spice from the hops and juniper, and the substantial malt body.  On the palate it is medium bodied with average carbonation, salty, and leaves your tongue numb after about half a glass.  Overall, a unique beer that my bartender suggested to me on account of the fact that the flavor and smell experience evolves over the course of drinking a glass; it starts out bacony and woody and changes to a spicier, more warming beverage.  Totally cool!","St. Joseph, Michigan, USA","dumontn"

2567,"2011-02-03",3.9,"Pours a hazy copper that is well carbonated causing a tower of frothy dirty white head. Slabs of lace lie inconsistently along the glass. Pungent smoke enters the nose, with a woody, bacon character. However, the smoke is not overbearing, as it is well balanced with sweet malts and some dark fruits (brewed with juniper berries). Similar to the aroma, I get smokey, hickory notes in the taste. Norwegian Wood isnt as meaty as some smoked beers, but displays enough that it cant be mistaken. What I find most interesting is the interplay between the woody smoke flavors and the sweet malts that balance it out. The finish displays a solid dry herbal hoppiness that levels out the smoke. I really only find juniper berries in the nose, as it is hard to decipher any in the layers of flavor. The body is smooth, somewhat creamy, but really easy to drink for a smoked beer. For a lot of beers of this style, its one and done. Norwegian Wood is a beer I can see myself drinking two or three in a sitting. I have to hand it to HaandBryggeriet for making one of the most drinkable smoked beers I have had to date.","Pennsylvania, USA","sarahmarie"
2567,"2011-01-31",3.8,"Appearance: earthen woody browns with a light haze. Tannish head fades into a thin tan head. Swirls with nice puff and then fades back into initial thin layer.

Nose: smoke with a touch of sweet, wood, earth, and dirt. Wet earth, wet wood, and wet firewood; being deep in the middle of a forest after rain has put out a still smoldering fire. Old worn leather. Fireside smoke, burning embers.

Palate: chocolate and smoke, woody and smoke. Apple skins with a faint tinge of plum for fruity tannic tartness along the edges. Earth and wood damp and smoldering. Cedar. Bacon smoke is barely a whisper, more of a clean smoke. Red hot embers. Smoke lingers gently in breath with the essence of windblown embers and forestry.

Long-lasting bitter smokey aftertaste with hints of coffee, resin and wood.

Solid craft brew, despite its relatively low drinkability due to the very poignant flavors.

OK, really nice tan head, and very active carbonation. Not much aroma but a little dirty/basement. Orange brown in color and fairly clear. Sweet & sour, wood & mold.

A deep ruby brown color with a medium-sized tanned head that leaves some lacings.

The smell is quite pleasant with gentle smoky aromas, caramel malts, juniper, tart fruits and wood. 

The taste is somewhat sweet with a complementary tart fruity flavor. Kind of dense malty backbone and notes of caramel. Restrained, yet prominent smoky aromas. The juniper adds a nice fresh character to the beer. Hints of wood. The finish as a gentle bitterness to it and lingering malty flavors. 

Medium body, slightly sticky texture with a nice dry finish.

Pours chocolate brown, kind of murky, with a huge, fluffy tan head. Some visible effervescence around the edges of the glass.

Nose is quite smoky, with an organic peatiness around it, raisin and dark fruit underneath.

Taste has lots of dark fruit (raisins) and cocoa up front, some brown sugar as well, with the peaty smoke coming in about midway and really coming out around the finish. Finish is juicy, smoky, just a hint of smoked sausage, echoes of raisins and brown sugar wrapped in smoke. Really nice. Smoke contributed to the beer without totally wrapping up the entire character like some rauchbiers.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, light carbonation.

Drinkability is really rather high for a smoked beer - I could have drank more than one of these, and the sweetness in this coupled with the smoke would make this an absolute grand slam with pulled pork barbecue.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","JohnQPublic"

Poured into the dimple mug and the lacing lasted strong throughout the entire beer, but was not as sticky of a mouthfeel as this might indicate. Flavor has some malt, light red fruit, prune and, brown sugar, smoke. Maybe juniper berry, but I really have no idea what juniper berry tastes like. Solid medium body but finishes very clean with not much lingering good or bad. There is a creaminess to it that works really well with the flavors. I thought this was a little dopplebock-esque, with all the good comparisons that might come with it.

2567,"2008-10-07",3.6,"Batch #70 ~ 2007 Vintage
10/07/2008:  Haandbryggeriet Norwegian Wood is briming with good, woody smokiness with a hint of smoked meat in the aroma paired with some subtle milky, chocolate, and yeasty notes.  This beer is heavy carbonated at this point as evidenced by the loud sound the cap made when I popped it off, the continuous rush of bubbles from the bottom of the glass to the top, and the very large, foamy beige head that loiters on the top.  The color of this beer is a hazy, deep red with honey-colored highlights.  The flavor is actually somewhat unexpected.  It is mostly chocolate with some roasty and char.  I dont really get any of the meaty smoke or even regular smoke that I was expecting.  It is pretty much char and semi-sweet and dark chocolates.  It becomes more dry with a slightly overbearing yeast flavor as it warms (I prefer the flavor when it is a bit more cold).  There is also a slight sour/tartness that must be from the juniper berries.  The finish is dry, roasty, and has a mild bitterness to it.  There is thick, puffy lacing on the glass and even though the carbonation appears to be higher, the medium-full body of this beer prevents it from coming across as overcarbonated or fizzy.  Overall, this beer is very good.  At first I wished that it had more of the meaty smokiness to it.  However, this isnt supposed to be a smoked beer.  Therefore, I believe that the deep, roasted malt and char characteristics are more in line with the intentions of this brew.  The smoke is more subtle resulting in a very balanced beer and a delightful drinking experience.

I thought that this was pleasantly balanced between the smokiness and the other flavours. Most times I find rauchbiers to be way too smokey for my taste.

Slightly hazy, colour ranges from amberish brown to niqoutine yellow. 
Nice foamy cream white head (reminds me of something in between a stout and a Belgian dubbel, which tells me there might be some candi in there..). 

Sweet malty caramelish, piny, resinous aroma with a touch of smoke and a fruity hoppy hint. 

Nice acidic, slightly vinous attack on the palate. Discreet bitterness  Pretty dry & medium bodied. Slightly short aftertaste.

The taste is vinous (red, think zinfandel/shiraz) on the attack as well with a bit of caramelly malt, but the smoke (although not too strong) takes too much attencion. A pity, since i know that there are some juniper berries there as well as a nice malt profile that gets lost in the smoke.

Ok, on to the beer...16.9 oz. bottle pours a cloudy dark brown that allows a bit of light to pass through with a moderately large off-white head that lasted until the end of the glass and left a coating of foam with each sip.  Very pleasant aroma of smoke along with some herbal notes, which I am assuming are the juniper berries.  The flavor was equally nice with the smokiness not at all overdone along with some malt.  A bit of herbal/spice near the end, which I again assume are the juniper berries.  Initially, this beer is very effervescent and tingles the tongue almost like a glass of seltzer.  I let the beer rest for 15 minutes and came back to it, and the beer had settled nicely and the heavy effervescence had dissipated.  Moderate bitterness at the finish.

In long: Nose is light-moderate smoke.  Body is very fluffy.  Unusual flavour mixing dry tree bark, sawdust and spices.  Quite spicy with some cloves, cinnamon and other spicy notes that I usually find in Christmas beer.  Id even add some streak/bbq-like spices to this spicy array.  Limited fruity notes (probably because the spiciness overwhelms them.  A whole lot of dry leafy spicy hops.

The juniper is there with rosy cotton and mulberry, ignited by a flickering of unbridled burnt oak to boot. Rose hips and spearmint keep the herbaceous floral arrangement in aromatic alignment while smoky applewood goes the extra mile. Flavor produces similar sentiments, seemingly lighter at first until the applewood and juniper combination smoke out the other flavors. Cherry blossoms and discernable fatty acids are kept even keel by the livelihood professed by the juniper, substituting in large part for the herbal and bitter hop bouquet. Medium bodied at first sip, then laying in heavier as the smoke goes full circle.

Texture is a bit fiberous. Moderate smoke (mesquite) flavor integrated into the malt and hop ratio creating a delicate balance.  I think back to my childhood. The boyscout days by the campfire.

I kill a squirrel, roast it over open flame and smother it in crushed blueberries. Vibrant, tangy and dappled with soy. Thats an exciting aroma. Pours a clear, brilliant ruby, with orange fringe and soft, redolent birch heartwood head. Flavor finds a home amongst the juniper smoke. A really expressive, soft flavor. Light sea oats, fresh grain bread, and rich caramels. Dry, dry, dry which makes it just delightful in my eyes. The back end carries a really powerful wallop of herbs, ranging from searing rosemary, to softer subtle chamomile. Fresh and bright. The smoke wisps in through the pine bough air. Snow melts. Smoke character is not overwhelming, only assists the complexity coming from the yeast and juniper. A fantastic beer!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
2567,"2008-03-04",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2017 My Bottom Line:
Bountiful wooden smoke sweeps the lean caramel maltiness, letting the eclectic, peppery fruitiness of juniper berries rise to the occasion before it is brushed by a leafy hop bitterness.

-An everlasting tower of foam protects the cloudy dark russet.
-The large, prickly bubbling doesnt help the mouthfeel much and is the main reason why this beer didnt cross the threshold of excellence for me.
-The dry wooden smoke in the nose is simple and effective, but not as appealing as the flavor profile.
-The fruitiness is well balanced with the smokiness.
-This is not very far from a Stjørdalsøls flavor profile. 
-The mix of smoke, yeast and bittering hops creates an earthy puff towards the end.

The malt presence is noticable, but not as sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe.  There is a mild hop bitterness to the finish.  Overall this is a surprisingly excellent brew.

Pours darkish caramel brown, looks a little cloudy. A big four finger, somewhat foamy biege head arises with each pour. Eventually settles to a thin somewhat globby covering. Aroma is sweet - kind of like dark rum, maybe brown sugar and wood, juniper perhaps - kind of hard to decipher the aroma. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin, lightly syrupy and a bit fizzy. Flavor is fairly heavy smokey wood with light malt sweetness and I suppose juniper berries (although Im not real familiar with their taste). Light-medium bitter. Quite smokey - this could easily be called a smoked beer - kind of a combo between a smoked and a spiced. Not sure I really like the juniper however.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"

Also a mild grass and herbal hops component. Perhaps a bit of pine. Quite bitter in the finish and a long linger. This is the type of brew I like to spend an afternoon with as Im smoking meat.

The aroma out of the bottle was insane.  Most smoked meat based aroma ever.  But when it was poured into the glass, it has a salted light meat and juniper berries.  The majority of the smoke went away when poured.  The rough assumption is that this is a porter because its a lot like it with the chocolate malt.  Juniper berries come through as well.  Very unique and the smoke comes through.  The palate is roasted and medium bodied.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
2567,"2008-01-24",3.4,"Batch 70, brewed March 2007; Sampled January 2008
Smokey aromatics greet my nose as I pour this brew into my glass.  It is very well carbonated and easily produces a tan crown of froth that is a full five fingers in height (including almost two-finger above the rim of my glass.  The smoke is definitely the dominant characteristic of the aroma; the smoke is a mix of salt, meaty umami, smoked cherry, smooth phenolics and perhaps a hint of plastic.  The aroma is pretty appetizing, but it is very hard to smell anything other than the smoke.

Still well carbonated the beer foams just a bit as it hits my mouth.  It smoothes out considerably as the beer flows across my tongue and even picks up some chewy texture and almost creamy quality to it by the finish.  The beer has a smooth, hearty smokiness to it up front, but picks up a touch of sharp esters and phenolics towards the finish.  Up front the smoke character melds in with the malt sweetness so well that the sweetness is not overly noticed, but instead makes the smoke seem quite appetizing.  Somehow the smoke balances this up front note in the finish with a bit of sharper phenolics, but there are also some dry, lingering, toasty grain notes in the finish as well.  Touches of berry notes seem to be in the flavor as well, though it seems very hard to pick them out underneath the smokiness.  The smoke combines quite well with the heft of this brew; it is just enough to be chewy, but not so much as to make this anything near a sipping brew.

An interesting idea, but it seems somehow not all that well executed.  The flavor is wonderful if you like smoked beers (which I do), but I really wish more of the juniper could have come through.  In the end it is a bit one dimension, especially considering I was hoping for a smoked beer with something else going on.  Still this is a tasty brew and one that I am certainly enjoying.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Pine, fruit, charred wood, cedar.  There is a slight sour note that becomes tart as it warms and slightly acidic that must be from the juniper berries.

Smoke -- like snuffed candles -- peaches and bananas, perhaps as saltwater taffy candies.  In the background lurks some rusty, oxide aromas.  From there it gets really strange, flush with smoked salmon, brined olives, pine needles and cedar.  What a rush.  The flavour begins moderately sweet with elements of tangerine, cedar and taffy.  Some notes of pine and peach shine through as acidity along with some tart berries.  Around mid-palate the smoke jumps in, tinged with sea salt and oranges.  The finish is mostly dry with a little Meyer lemon sweetness.  Also present, some more saltiness, light smoke and berry skins...never tannic though.

Subtle hints of rye and pine boughs sharpen up the smokey malt body.  Medium bodied, spritzy carbonation with a chalky texture.  Flavors of smoke, charred jerky, and loads of juniper berries.  Tastes like a Canadian forest fire.  Roasty caramels and a blazing pine forest.  Really a fantastic brew; the smoke flavor is intense, but still allows the malt flavors to come through boldly.

Bottle from Enjoyit via trade.  The pour was a slightly cloudy brown with some lighter golden highlights.  A very foamy (as usual from these guys) head appeared, at least three-fingers tall yet only provided a bit of lacing.  Belgian yeast comes forth in the aroma initially before giving way to smoky peat, earth, pine and then, albeit briefly, some tart berry that Ill assume was the junipers.

2567,"2007-11-30",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 12, 2008 Bottle pours a deep and hazy amber with a 6 inch head that clings well...  Still lots of head.  The aroma is malty, yeasty, floral hops, and pipe tobaco.  The flavor is a real nice mellow bundle of malt, light smoke, Belgian stale hops, lingering ale sour notes, ripe cave aged blue cheese, with some light bitterness playing with the other notes well.  The juniper did not really hit me until much warming.  The palate is  mostly cleansing and fairly medium bodied.  Overall, kind of nice.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"
2567,"2007-11-30",3.8,"Bottle.  Pours a deep dark ruby amber with brown tones and a massive foamy cloud-like beige head.  Aroma is very earthy, spicy- floral hops, flowers, tons of spices- pepper, some clove- earth and leather,  light cold smoke- some smoked fish, juniper berries, pine and mint.  Good full flavor- more pine, mint, juniper- gin-like- solid malt backbone- sweet toffee, roast, some chocolate, and some woody earthy hints.  Bitter and slightly astringent finish.  Very unique and enjoyable.  I feel like this is similar to the Jackeldricka from Heavywieght, except this one is highly carbonated and sweeter.  Nice beer.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

2567,"2007-11-23",3.8,"The aroma was smoke and  oak with a toasty caramel undercurrent and a beechwood presence. The aroma was woodsy and a bit earthy but mostly the aroma was pleasant phenolic smoke. The beer poured into the glass very slightly hazy amber with a frothy, tall and huge tannish head which lasted forever to lace the glass. The flavor was strong smoke with a woodsy and herbal characteristic and a molasses and honey undercurrent. The flavor was hugely phenolic and the bittering was not challenged much by the caramel malt presence. The finish was dry with lasting citrus and piney characteristics well into the aftertaste and beyond. The body was medium and despite a huge head, the carbonation level was only moderate.

Aroma has a fair amount of smoke, dry wood and some roast, but unfortunately there is some hairspray as well.  Although Im not entirely sure what juniper smells/tastes like, Im not getting it here.  Flavor is much the same, little sweetness, some wood acidity in the middle with an earthy ashy bitter finish (3-4 out of 10). Medium body with plenty of carbonation.  Much better than the piece of crap Viking rauch I had earlier, but thats pretty much a given. 6-4-7-3-13--3.3.
RERATE: Batch 109, brewed Nov. 07.  Clear copper brown with a 1 1/2 finger light beige head, fair retention.  Aroma has a good amount of campfire smoke and beef jerky.  There is also some clean caramel malts behind.  As it warms, there is a bit of a soapy note, but doesnt really detract too much.The flavor is still pretty smoky, and seems dry (from the smoke) but actually has a fair amount of sweet caramel and lightly sweet toasted malts.  There is a light fruitiness that one could possibly say is juniper, though without knowing, I would not have picked it out.  Roasty semi-dry finish with bitterness thats around a 3.

A very lively pour, with massive head and carbonation. The berries are faintly evident in the nose, but generally crowded out by the smoke. As the beer settles down, the smooth smoke isnt quite so evident (in either nose or flavor) but theres a pleasant balance between the tart berries, some hops, and the firewood flavor.

The nose on this is hugely rich, with heavy toasted grains, toasted wheat bread, faint yeast esters, meaty smoke, and drying, aged wood.  The body is medium to light, with a softness and spiciness that’s pretty unique.  Heavy flavors of toasted bread, lightly charred grains and more of that meat/jerky/smoke flavor.

2567,"2007-11-09",4.3,"Batch #72 (brewed in April, 07): Deep rufous. Delicate pour yields a mountainous off-white head which slowly settles and condenses into a fine cream. Mesmerizing nose of plum jam, salt, rauch malt, raisins, roasted bananas, and a plethora of airy esters and plasticy phenols. Extremely earth-laden with hints of leather and wood. Natural carbonation sports the softness and weightlessness of a feather. Just gorgeous. Full and unfiltered, to boot. The cleanness is highly apparent from the get go, as the sweeping airiness cleanses the palate and paves the way for a dense and intriguing rush of plums and raisins. Fruity esters are just as slick as they are bright and defined. Lush smokiness soon takes foothold and buttresses the beautiful body. Musty yeast deepens the initially subdued juniper, with a waxy characteristic. Juniper soon develops a forceful bitterness, holding strong from hereon, and unites with a coarse and equally refined earthy-hop bitterness which augments the already impeccable attenuation with a minty/piney coolness. Malts are pillow soft in their breadiness, and vivid as all get out. Munich malt is well integrated amid a whole host of malt complexities, yet somehow manages to tout its vibrant toffee-glazed biscuit quality. Adept malt extraction here. Finishes remarkably balanced, with juniper leading the way with tangy smoke, bready malts, and dusty cocoa accents offering their elegant whispers beneath the lingering bitterness. All the elements I love (mulitlayered, complex yet subtle, clean yet rustic, proportionate, smoky, fruity, bitter, etc., etc.) are featured so beautifully here. A praiseworthy effort, and as traditional as anything thatll ever touch your lips.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

But hey, what do I know. Feel has a pretty full carbonation to it that really takes over the mouth. Liquid is well bodied. Overall a good drink. Not an overpowering smoked beer at all.

2567,"2007-11-02",3.8,"Robust, glowing chestnut pour, retaining its beige skin throughout and letting only the slightest silhouette through the muck.  Beautiful.  Punchy, bold aroma of juniper imparts a crisp gin and zesty lime character; needly, cool, and tepidly synthetic.  Shades of orange and toffee in earthy sweetness, becoming increasingly fruity and bright with warmth.  An overpowering dry cedar quality dominates the initial flavor, leading toward more tart lime juice and wet spruce tips, being thoroughly layered with rustic smoke and crisp fruit sugars.  The fire, the mountain air, and the slowness of the roast are intimately and richly felt.  Spiced pumpernickel, a touch of soapish coffee acidity, and yeasts with a wild attitude; somehow at once sprightly and dark.  Of medium body with a very dry bite in the mouth, finishing with a heavy hit of floral foliage and puckering lemon plastic, warming on the final smack into hot, caramelized sugar and dough.  Detailed, and delicate, but perhaps donning too blatant a simplicity of synthetic tone, which is counterintuitive.  Altogether intriguing, though.  Thanks Zac!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

2567,"2007-10-04",4.2,"Freshly imported bottle (2007) from Shigadeyo, thanks!  Drunk on 9/26/07These top-tier Scandanavian breweries really have bottle conditioning nailed down.  Between these guys, Mikkeller, Olfabrikken, Nogne O and Gourmetbryggeriet, among others, Im extremely impressed.  Glowing auburn-magenta with light peach and orange tones.  Tiny bubbles rise, bolstering a massive off-white head that laces profusely and is retained throughout the entire glass.  High clarity, leaving the sediment behind.Surprisingly spicy, and not surprisingly smokey, Im at a loss as to whether Im smelling both hops and juniper or just juniper.  It sure smells like hops up front, with a fully herbal, almost wintergreen/spearmint nose, which gives way to cinnamon and clove phenols, followed by a heaping dose of very well-attenuated, fresh, woody, smokey caramel malts.  Rich, without being too sweet, they are interrupted, at interval, by poignant dots of what must be juniper acidity.  Works incredibly well in balancing the sweetness (which would not be overbearing even without the juniper).  Clean, but fresh yeast, no alcohol or flaws whatsoever.  Marvelously elegant, with a high strength of aroma, to boot!Sweet and spicy, with a gingerbread and cinnamon spice-like flavor incorporated in to the maltiness.  Smoke is more laid back than in the nose, but still provides wonderful complexity and woody tones to contrast with the rich caramel/toffee maltiness.  Near-perfect bitterness/acidity is attained from the juniper (and hops, if theyre in there), allowing one to focus on the smoke, take a break and focus on the acidity and then come back to the smoke and malt.  Not on the magnitude of Schlenkerla, but then, its not supposed to be, nor does it need to be.  Very, very carbonated, but with breathing it evens out, more or less.  Supple, unfiltered texture, no flaws.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

I am going to have to get a few more bottles of this stuff.","Saint Cloud, Florida, USA","CheesedMan"
2567,"2007-09-22",3.5,"Bottle (500ml).  Shared with chris_o, mes_and_sim, harrisoni, reakt and duff - via ... reakt?.  Amber-copper pour, bubbly, large lasting frothy off-white head. The aroma was coming at me from many directions - belgian spicy yeast, peaty malt, dry, woodsy - now I see it was made with juniper, I realize what I was trying to pin down.  The taste is quite dry, and theres quite a hit of smoke and iodine, very much like an Islay scotch - finishes bitter and minerally, long and sharp.  The mouthfeel is lively, minerally and has a tangy aftertaste.  Iron and even vague sour fruit - whats not to like?","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

The aroma was quite odd, but enjoyable.. lots of sour oak, smoked peat, some vanilla, and juniper branches in the background.  The flavor didnt mesh as well.. very sour from the berries and oak, chalky caramel, more dark fruits, and toffee in there.. smoky sour finish.  Sharp and sour on the palate with too much barrel influence.. felt good otherwise.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
2567,"2007-09-21",4.0,"500 mL bottle.  Pours a very natural-looking hazy brown/red color with a very large cream-colored head.  Aroma is yeast, oak, bourbon, smoke and alcohol with a wee bit of fruit sweetness.  Flavor is whoa, incredibly smoky... I feel like I am drinking a campfire.  Its well-balanced though, nice sweetness to it, a really unique beer.  I have to say that smoky beers are not the norm for me, but this one seems abnormally complex and drinkable.  Its good.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DeweyDell"
2567,"2007-09-21",3.4,"500ml bottle.  Batch #70, brewed March 07.  Upon popping the cap a generous amount of brown foam gushed out of the top.  Poured ridiculously carbonated - a dark red/brown body underneath a plethora of rocky, off-white foam.  Plenty of yeast makes its way into the glass.  Aroma tingles the nostrils.  Prickly wood, pine, cedar, and a lot of smokiness.  Very oaky.  Char.  Taste is very strong.  Flavor of smoke is intense and in your face, surely the most smoke Ive tasted in a beer before.  Charcoal and oak in the flavor as well.  Salt and peat.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin and carbonated, though it doesnt detract from the enjoyment.  I am a fan of smoke but this one is almost too much.  An admirable beer but a bit over the top on the flavor for me.  Still glad I tried it though.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Aroma is strong smoke with an undercurrent of faintly tart tropical fruits (must be the juniper).  Taste is very tart-y smoke.  Mouthfeeel is very fizzy form the strong carbonation, but works here because this is the first thoroughly refreshing smoked beer I have ever had.

Poured a murky brown with some ruby hues, very generous off-white to tan colored head (multiple fingers), very solid retention all the way down, lacing that was decent, but normally slid down to the head between sips. Aroma was heavily smoked malts, yet not with strong meaty elements typical of a fine rauch. The flavor was less than one dimensional (like the aroma was), yet not much more than that. Besides significant smoking, scottish ale peaty-like, tobacco, some caramel, some brown ale faint chocolate type nuances, finishes with a hop bite, although this thing left me wanting more when all was said and done, just a tad harsh on the smoke, seemingly somewhat astringent even.

2567,"2007-08-23",4.0,"This beer pours out like its been planning a desperate escape from the confines of the glass walls that have contained it for some time. Frenetic carbonation boils up to form a dense, fizzy but compacted, tall beige head with modest retention. The body is a hazy chestnut with brighter mahogany hues at the perimeter. The aroma is the next to attempt a daring break for freedom, this time from the liquid from which it stems. Roasted grains lead the charge, smoke hot on its heels, notes of meats and campfire and burning holiday themed decor in a wild conflagration that is neither restrained nor focused. Juniper essence bolts from the vessel, acidic, a burning green like the aftermath of the initial backdraft from a chemical explosion from deep within the densely forested tundra. Vegetation burns brightly, a smoke signal rises to alert anyone around to its exact location, a bright light in the shady regions of the chilling and desolate northern countryside. Bitterness, like the cold, stings in the flavor. Acidity wrings the mouth dry, like a sponge, cutting into my tongue and cheeks like the bristling vegetation that fans the flames. Smoke is reckless, covering the surface area of the inside of my mouth, then my face, then the surrounding air, devouring oxygen as it bulids in intensity with each smothering sip. The juniper does a marvelous job of replacing hops for a quenching and devastating assault on the tastebuds. The mild sweetness that lingers underneath finds air to breath in a sustained finish, extinguishing heat and scattering cool sensations across the palate. Carbonation, like fireworks robed in silk, further accelerates a broadening of sensations and flavors. A unique combination of smoke and greenery melded into a near-catastrophic taste explosion results in something more refined, more thought-provoking. Holiday themes come to mind. What fun this was!","Alabama, USA","boboski"

2567,"2007-08-21",3.9,"Bottle. Pours opaque dark mahogany with very large ivory head. The aroma is light smoke, assertive spiciness, some cedar-like wood notes (juniper and cedar are related, so I guess that makes sense), and some caramel. The flavor is very obviously smoke-centric, but it is a much more rounded smoke flavor than a typical rauchbier. A moderate chocolatey malt backbone lies underneath with some rather distant berry notes. The finish has an ashy sort of bitterness, entirely compatible with the other smoke tones, and some hoppiness as well. A lingering, charred dryness sticks around for quite a while.

Initially, all I could pick up  was a solid smoke on the nose.  As the head slowly sunk into the body, an almost hop like berry character emerged.  Unlike most smoked beers, the smoke on the nose didnt remind me of meats, just good burnt wood.  The body however was a different story.  Holy smoked pork batman - Im picking this up for my next Ramadan party.  And Im talking GOOD smoked pork here.  The finish had a faint berry character which I assume is juniper.

2567,"2007-07-21",3.5,"Woah. This is a weird one. Pours a murky reddish brown color with a rather large slightly off white head. Aroma has some earthy smokey hints. The flavor is tangy with lots ashy muddiness. This is  weird but I sorta like it!","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"
2567,"2007-07-20",3.8,"500ml bottle. Cloudy reddish copper with a huge head. Good retention. Aroma is smoky wood covering everything else. Taste is smoke with dark fruit and brown sugar. Medium bodied. Somewhat chalky. Creative beer.","Swedesboro, New Jersey, USA","MrBendo"
2567,"2007-07-16",4.1,"Umm, belgian smoked beer, mix two of my favorites and ill have seconds. Pours cloudy amber with a thin white head. Sweet delicious smokiness, not like cheap ash tray, but more like fine cigar aroma, earthy throughout. Great balance between the fruity malts and the smoked finish, nothing uneven, just a good display of sharing the responsibilities of making me happy. I hope I can get my hands on bottles of this in the Portland market soon.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
2567,"2007-07-14",3.4,"Bottled. Amber coloured. Unclear. Dense light brown head. Sweetness, fruits, light spice and smoke in the aroma. Flavour is smoked as well.

2567,"2007-07-12",3.8,"Tried at SIB. I was really looking forward to this one, and it was indeed a unique and worthy beer for the SIB lineup. Lots of smoke in the aroma and tatse mixed with a bit of sour fruit. A little oakey and earthy. I really enjoyed this; but smoke might be my favorite taste in a beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","glkaiser"
2567,"2007-07-06",4.0,"Dark copper with a big and firm slightly off-white head. Wood and smoke dominates the aroma, which also has a bit of dark fruit and caramel. I get some juniper after swirling a few times. Dry and bitter flavour with the juniper delivering a gin-like tinge. All in all its a very good beer and a traditional ale of the kind that makes you believe in the good stories of old tradition. The smoke and juniper makes it a bit heavy to drink though, so dont buy a sixpack for Saturday night...","Odense, DENMARK","Christian"

Dark brown in color with a thin head.  Woody and malty aroma. The flavor was that of a traditional ale.  Medium body with a slight oxidized flavor.  I am sure this bottle has had to travel.  Not bad for a nice small brewery.","Olympia, Washington, USA","BrewDad"

2567,"2007-06-20",4.0,"500 ml bottle. Reddish copper colour. Throws a tall fine-laced off-white head. Head clings to the glass. Rich piney and floral smoked malt aroma. Very balanced. Hops enhance the complexity. Smells absolutely wonderful.  Crisp bitter flavours and a lively fine carbonation at first. There is quite a bit of malt flavours there, but they drown a bit in the rather bold bitterness. The bitterness stems from both hops and juniper berries I think. Still there is a lot of flavour and a little complexity in there. Long lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this beer has a fantastic aroma, but it doesnt really carry on to the flavour and aftertaste, both which is dominated by the bitterness. That said, this is a very characterful and rich beer that deserves to be inbibed.","Oslo, NORWAY","Gr0ve"

2567,"2007-05-14",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2007 Bottle. A really good beer. This is very smoky, but not overpowering. The beech-smoke is evident from aroma to the last swallow and blends very well with the juniper berries. The use of the german wheat strain is a wise choice. It adds some interesting fruity notes that brings the beer an extra dimension. And it also brings the beer closer to the traditional Norwegian ales that often uses farm-strains that give bavarian or belgian-like fruitiness.","Florø, NORWAY","tykjen"

The aroma is extremely complex, starting with juniper and wood, light roasted malt with a discreet touch of smoke and yeast.

2567,"2007-03-18",4.0,"Bottled. I were lucky enough to have a pre-release taste at a beer-dinner where Haandbryggeriet kindly donated a crate of this one and the other new beer, Dark Force. It poured golden-brown, almost completely clear, with a nice beige head, leaving nice lacings as well. The wooden aromas started escaping the beer immediately, and was followed by some smoke, roastyness, juniper-fruityness and bitterness. It has a smoked and woody flavor, with juniper, roasted malt, bitterness, fruityness and something reminding med of the smell of the sleeper on a railroad track. It has a medium to full body and a long bitter finish. Theres a distinct juniper note in the finish as well. Its a quite complex beer with lots of flavors and aromas from a Norwegian conifer forest. My favourite from Haandbryggeriet. (070317)","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
