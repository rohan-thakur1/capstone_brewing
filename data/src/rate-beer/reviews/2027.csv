2027,"2015-09-12",3.9,"This was excellent. Aroma should have been an 11. Just roasty enough, just smooth enough. Vanilla and coffee comes through without being overpowering. Would definitely drink this again.

2027,"2015-08-28",4.3,"Draft:
Clear, nearly black with a beige head.
Huge vanilla, hazelnut, dark chocolate aroma.
Big taste, too...coffee, nut, vanilla, chocolate.
Slick and malty.
Would be equally good with breakfast or as a dessert.
Extremely tasty....wonderful.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
2027,"2015-05-03",3.1,"This was the best of the three beers I tried at the Parkville microbrew fest in 2015. Vanilla dominated the nose and aftertaste, but it was pleasantly chocolatey as well.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","ads135"
2027,"2014-10-11",3.9,"Sampled at Augusta. Very dark with a tan head. A sweet chocolate coffee nose is nice. Those flavors with earth. Citrus and dark fruot work well.nice.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
2027,"2014-04-29",3.7,"Sample at Parkville Microbrew Festival. Comes dark brown with a small khaki head. Aroma of vanilla, chocolate, malt, and coffee. Taste is vanilla, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and some coffee. Nice.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
2027,"2014-04-14",3.7,"Draft at the brewpub, served in a tulip. Pours a dark brown, not opaque, with a small beige head. Aroma of vanilla, chocolate, coffee (lighter roast), toast, nuts, and brown sugar. Flavor is basically the same - a smooth balance of vanilla, toast, and roast from the coffee. I actually would have liked a little more of the coffee character in here, but fortunately the vanilla doesnt dominate. Light-medium bodied, with a smooth mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Very nice variant on the Velvet Underbrown.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2027,"2014-03-14",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2014 Silky smooth. Strong coffee. Vanilla. Dark like oil. Really solid and well done beer.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","gregwilsonstl"
2027,"2014-01-19",3.9,"Well, this is quite the nice twist on a brown ale. Pours very dark brown with a small beige head. The aroma has lots of vanilla, subtle coffee, roasted malt and roasted nuts. It has a medium / full body that is smooth an velvety (fitting for the name of the beer) with light soft carbonation. The flavor begins with heavy toast, nuttiness, vanilla, light bitterness and minor coffee. The finish has heavy hazelnut taste and some coffee bitterness. Solid beer.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
