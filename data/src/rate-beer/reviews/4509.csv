4509,"2015-02-28",3.3,"Bottle, 75cl. A dense, finger-thick light beige head forms over an unclear orange-golden body with lots of floaties. The aroma is weak for a 12% ABV beer, with fruityness, some sweet maltyness and alcohol. Its warming and full-bodied with a soft carbonation level. Rather sweet, with fruityness and bitterness to deal with it. Alcohol, resins, orange peel and bitterness. Rather warming this one, a bit too warming I think, but quite nice anyway. 150228","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

4509,"2013-11-30",4.1,"Mit der neuen Hachenburger-Selection N°4 ICE-Bock setzt die Brauerei offensichtlich die Serie fort und überrascht erneut. Durch den leicht blumigen Antrunk wirkt der Eis-Bock leichter, als er mit seinen 12% wohl ist. Das Flaschen-Design ist wie auch schon die Vorgänger-Versionen bestechend elegant und doch mit dem hell-blau neu definiert.","","Andi_12"
