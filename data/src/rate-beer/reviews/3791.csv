3791,"2017-03-21",3.9,"Theres really not much on the nose here at all, but everything else more than makes up for that. Nose is vague and estery, perhaps a little bit of brewers yeast tablets. Taste is very good: rich malt, creamy, a savoury umami sherry note (well, its madeira obviously, but for tasting note purposes I think sherry is acceptable). That dark brown character of a proper doppelbock. The palate is the best part, I think. Mouth coating and creamy, but with a tart edge that lifts it out of being cloying. And all the flavours carry on in harmony into a long finish. Great beer.","Motherwell, SCOTLAND","rodbod"
3791,"2017-03-04",3.5,"0.33l bottle. Looks good. It pours a mild blurry reddish amber, dark looking body. On the top theres a nice medium sized off-white and quite lacing top. It has a nice sweetish aroma. Darker types of sugar and a little dark dried berries. Traces of banana sweetness. Smells really nice and it really opens up after a while in the glass this. It has a mild oily texture in the mouth. Thinner than the abv should suggest, and its about average on the carbonation. Get a little bit of alcohol, the Madeira is really present and pleasant in the taste. Slightly dry and sourish, lots of raisin and dried figs. Burnt sugar and a little booze. Nice stuff this. 04.03.2017","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Intense deep caramel, the sweetish Madeira-wine is there, round and refreshing, smooth malty, caramel, round and mild. The Weizenbock is there, not too intense typical, the yeast is like in the other Tempus-Beers more neutral than spicy-fruity. Thick aftertaste with not too much wheat-aroma, caramel, roasted sugar, wood. Nice.","Wuppertal, GERMANY","Erzengel"

3791,"2016-09-11",3.3,"Tried after the Demios and extremely similar. Again a pleasant enough drop and slightly more open flavours than the Demios. On the whole rather a disappointment as the wood and interesting flavours really takes a back seat to the adequate dopplebock. For the cost certainly would not bother again.
