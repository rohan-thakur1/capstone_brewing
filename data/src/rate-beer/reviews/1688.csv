1688,"2017-02-16",3.9,"Its my five year anniversary for joining RateBeer, so I thought to celebrate this great feat by having a style I rarely rate. In five years, Ive come around to really appreciate all styles for what they are, rather than focus on my original love of IPAs and Stouts. Ive come a long way. 

Anyway. Aroma is clove, wheat, banana, fruity, slight hop, eh. Appearance is golden, hazy, white head. Taste is wheat, fruity, slight banana and clove, earthy hop, good. Mouthfeel is light body, light crisp carbonation, wheat and hop aftertaste. Overall, I was expecting this to be not great by the aroma, but the banana and clove are dialed back to let the wheat shine in this. Well done for a style I typically avoid.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"

1688,"2014-12-22",5.0,"500 ml bottle, poured into a tulip glass at approximately 45 degrees F.

A: Pours a beautifully cloudy deep straw gold, and forms a spectacularly frothy head of tight white bubbles. The head alone leaves lacing down the glass as it recedes, and so too the beer itself, in sheets of tightly-entwined froth that slowly split apart to slip down the sides of the glass in small patches. Columns of tiny bubbles can be seen erupting continuously from the bottom of the glass, only to vanish about half an inch into their ascent, obscured by the cloudiness.

S: A rich bouquet of wheat, fruit, and spice greets the nose from the glass. Banana, apple, pear, and honeydew melon skip along arm-in-arm, amidst softly, faintly bready wheat, while clove and coriander cavort alongside.

T: Bliss. So much fruitiness, packed into a single beer without overdoing the intensity or going over the top. No one flavor leaps out, but instead, all seem to hit and subtly dance and shift about in unison. All the fruits from the aroma are present, all rolling through the backdrop of silky wheat to precisely the same degree, with exactly the right amount of spice from the clove and coriander notes. A hint of a citrus tinge rounds out the flavor profile. Delightful.

M: Light, airy, and lively, this hefe sparkles across the palate and tongue, yet manages to avoid having the carbonation sharpness appear in the taste.

O: This is, to me, the perfect hefeweizen, and quite possibly the perfect beer - flavorful yet subtle, complex yet approachable, refreshing and intriguing, able to be drunk quickly or sipped and savored. I have no idea how Ayinger works this sorcery, but I am eminently pleased they do.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Crisp and smooth palate; Mouth feel is strong wheatyness but not very tart in a solid body. Very smooth to the tongue which brings out the vanilla and caramel. Banana ester is light with shades of red fruits. Light phenolic weith good cloves and spices. Quite yeasty with matching light malt. Solid!... Hoppiness is fragrant light lemon and loe grassy hops in nose and taste. Bitterness is typical weiss low-fi but notable in background for a mostly wheaty light tart finish; Quite dry after taste, very easy and smooth to mouth.

Comments: This ones main forte are its quite fragrant banana ester and lemony hops aroma, plus smoothness in palate. I also think this one is quite well-balanced, with aromatic hops and clove spicy elements being well expressed without amplifying its chemical aspects. Still, For richness and smoothness, this one cannot top the Neumarkter Lammsbräu Weisse. All in all, very solid and functional, a nice one if the price is right.

1688,"2014-04-27",4.0,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance had a hazy yellow colored looking body with a nice lumpy two and a half finger white foamy head that must last for at least a good three minutes before dieing and leaving some foamy clingy lacing in its wake.
The smell has strong notes of spicy clove, ""banana"" esters enter in to assist in balancing. Some wheatiness comes in as well.
The taste was spicy yet sweet yet wheaty, slight ""banana""-like aftertaste, sweet dry finish.
On the palate, it sat at/about a medium in body, and was somewhat sessionable. Carbonation seems a bit more subdued than most hefeweizens Ive had, however its still pretty good for the style.
Overall, hey what a nice hefeweizen, glad I tried this and would greatly welcome this again, which says a ton since Im not a true hefeweizen fan.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Theres a lot of bubblegum in there as well upon second sniff. Im also getting some hints of oxidation as well. No best before or bottling date so its impossible to tell how old this bottle is. Theres a huge dose of banana on the palate mixed with some more subtle fruit notes. The spiciness isnt as high as I might like and that hint of papery oxidation persists and theres an added vanillan quality that wasnt evident on the nose. Nice full round mouthfeel.

The beer is hazy and straw yellow with but a wee head that leaves virtually no lacing. Several attempts at coaxing a head out of the beer yield little results. As this seems to be an anomaly and likely not the fault of the beer itself, I wont judge too harshly. The aroma is of banana, clove, and wheat, as was expected. The flavor is pretty good. The beer is simple and straightforward, with a pronounced banana presence. The body is quite thin and watery, more so than I would prefer. On the upside, this goes down easily and would be a good hot weather beer, suitable for quenching your thirst on a summer day.

Banana, cloves & also some lemon added in for good measure; a wonderful smelling beer that is much like most other hefeweizen. Very well balanced and quite sweet with hints of wheat and some malts.

Lighter than a usual hefeweizen, yellowy gold with a massive three-finger seized, foamy white head with great retention

Lots of banana & clove upfront coupled with wheat & some citrus too. Well balanced & easy to drink, there is a banana finish as well & some good hops.

Light side of medium bodied, smooth & refreshing. Carbonation is also on the light side of medium; there is a great feel to this one.

Extremely well balanced & the banana flavour at both the beginning & the end of the taste was excellent & matched the nose very well. Not the absolute best hefeweizen out there but fantastic none the less.

1688,"2011-03-07",4.8,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 500ml bottle into a tall weizen glass. The abv is listed on the back label (5.1%) but there is no freshness date.

Appearance: The body has an orange/yellow color with a cloudy haze and some visible carbonation. On top I got a thick and creamy off white head. It is long lasting and makes slick lace ring which slowly slide down the sides of the glass.

Smell: The aroma has notes of sweet bubble gum and banana peel with just a light touch of wheat malt.

Taste/Palate: The flavor is not as sweet as the aroma foreshadowed. Tangy wheat meets the tongue first with a light clove banana yeast notes following. A touch of citrus and spicy/leafy hops leads into the finish which is crisp and fairly dry. The firm medium body has plenty of active carbonation give it a lively snappy texture.

The aroma shows characters of banana, and a slightly husky grain note.  The palate shows that same husky, tannin-like grain note up front, before some nice banana.  Carbonation is assertive, but not a distraction.  The beer seems to have held up really well, given the long and unintended aging time.

Aroma is rich ripe banana esters in perfect balance with the clove phenols. A bubble gum emerges now and then accentuating the bananaish sweetness. Malted wheat is perceived as faint doughy scent. On the contrary to the nose, the doughy flavor is the dominant one and both banana and clove are far less expressed than in the aroma section.

The aroma is wheat, bananas and spice.  It leans more toward clean, sweet wheat/banana than spice (probably closer to the Weihenstephaner than the Schneider), but the spice is definitely there.  The taste is bready sweet.  Its like a liquid cake with hints of banana and clove/vanilla bean.  Mouthfeel is spot on, and it goes down smoothly and easily.  I would be very happy to drink a glass every day with lunch.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

16.9 oz. bottle from Johns Grocery, Iowa City, $2.49

Ar: Classic German wheat aroma.  Big banana-clove nose, lots of spice.
Ap: Pours a very hazy yellow-gold with a huge weizen head that leaves good lace.
T: Follows suit of the aroma: Banana, clove, and a little tart bite.  I would have liked a bit more tartness, as I found this a bit cloying.
P: Nice chewy body with lots of carbonation.

Aroma is big and nice with some banana & some nice spiciness, some light lemon zest and lots of yeast notes. I swear I detect a hint of smokiness in the aroma which is weird but works really dang well alongside the other things going on here. Flavor is drier than one usually expects for the style but most certainly does not take away from the classic flavors of a hefe, the banana and clove are there but theyre not accompanied by the remarkable fruitiness or the normal residual sweetness that so many beers in this style lean on. Instead these flavors are complimented by a strong yeasty character, white bread crust,  and some nice mild citrus rind notes.  Please dont get me wrong I love Franziskaner and I love Weihenstephaner but this seems a lot drier than those ones and that seems to set it apart as a hefeweizen.

Im not sure if I got an old bottle or if this beer is suppose to be like this but the aroma was terrible, a very sharp sent what I can only describe as compost and a very strong sour cherry smell was coming from my glass. Luckily the beer tasted better then the smell. A chalky banana flavor with lots of smooth grassy malts, and a touch of citrus make up most of the flavor, theres something a little off in the taste of this hefe. The more I drink the more bread I can taste, and as the beer warms more banana flavor comes out.

1688,"2008-11-20",3.8,"No one does weisse, or wheat beers, better than Germany. There, I said it, and let it be known that I speak the truth. German wheat beers are a breed unto their own to whom others look to for affluence and inspiration. That isnt to say that wheat beers of various styles havent been around for generations, but none as distinct and flavorful as the German weisse beer. Light, refreshing, and full of soft succulent chewy wheat and spices, I hold in my possession today the Brau-weisse from Ayinger, a traditional German brewery who has yet to disappoint.

A huge head almost overtakes my glass and I pause to savor her visage along while allowing time for her to settle in before dispensing the rest of her cloudy orange and golden body. As her head recedes and light lace trails my glass, a subtle nose of freshly cut pears and lemon waft up to my nose. Mingling hints of spice, clove, coriander, basil, and more orange round her out. Unable to contain my thirst any longer, I delve into her golden depths and am embraced by her soft, chewy body bursting with freshly squeezed oranges, tangerines, and lemons. A vibrantly citric start leads into a softer middle and finish with lots of fresh chewy wheat, ripe bananas, and fresh warm dough. In-between quaffs I enjoy a pleasant lingering presence of spices, clove and coriander being the two prominent culprits. As I near the end of my journey, even more of the soft ripe bananas and wheat make their way to the forefront, buoyed faithfully by juicy ripe oranges and crisp citric esters. Amazingly refreshing and even though she is a larger bottle, I could easily enjoy multiple sessions.

It is true that to date Ayinger hasnt let me down with a single brew, but that is no guarantee of a good beer all the time. Thankfully, instead of being let down, I am once again reminded why Ayinger remains at the top of my list when it comes to solidly performing German breweries. Weise beers are notably pawned as summer beers because of their light and flavorfully refreshing palate, but I personally can enjoy a weisse beer any time of the year.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

I got the slightest clove notes, but that might be my mind telling me that it should be in a hefe!  Flavor was a fruity/citrusy balance that was light enough to be very thirst-quenching.

At just around $2.50, this was one of the better deals for a quality beer   I have seen around.  It almost rivals Capitals Kloster Weizen for a favorite,   except that I can get the latter fresher.  Still, this one might just be a   close second on price and quality.

Aroma / Appearance - Hints of banana, oatmeal, wheat, fruit and honey   greeted my eager nose.  The cloudy nectarine colored body had a rich   two-finger head with active carbonation bubbling to the top.  The pleasing   looking brew looked like it was going to fit the bill after a long day   outside in 90 degree temperatures.

Flavor / Palate - Creamy ripe bananas were the first thing to hit my   taste buds.  Muted underneath that was a combination of wheat, oats and a   mild bitterness that hit the back of the mouth.  A sweet, pleasant hoppiness   followed not too long afterwards.  The sweet banana taste dominated my   impressions but it was not so strong as to mask everything else.  This was   solid all the way through to the end of the glass.  It might become a nice   summer drinker, especially at the price Woodmans charges for it.  Pick it   up to get a feel for a well done hefeweizen.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1688,"2005-12-18",3.7,"17-Dec-05 (22 oz bottle: Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) Oh yeah, a rerate was definitely in order on this one.  Purchased at a truly reputable store, I have no fears about whether this will be a good bottle.  The bottle opens with a fairly loud phhhttt, and the beer pours about two inches of white, creamy head with tight beading.  Retention is superb as several minutes later, I still have a quarter inch cap, though this is partially aided by significant carbonation bubbles rising through the beer.  The color is medium straw and slightly hazy, so the streams of carbonation bubbles are plainly visible and combined with the wonderful head retention make for a visually stunning beer.  The only problem is the lack of lacing on the glass.  The very enticing nose projects a prominent banana aroma with very light clove and wheat.  Banana again plays a prominent role in the flavor initially, but this fades a bit in the finish to allow the wheat flavor to come to the forefront.  Bitterness is low but not missing, sweetness is mild, and a slightly spicy character makes brief showings from time to time.  The overall flavor is very pleasant and enjoyable, but shows proper restraint, giving an air of classiness.  A small complaint is that the flavor tails off a bit too much late in the finish rather than showing resilience on the palate.  Body is light-medium and very well carbonated for a lively and exciting mouthfeel.  Im not a certified beer judge (yet!), but I consider this to be a textbook example of the German Hefeweizen.  It just needs a better finish to be the ""be all, end all"".12-Sep-05 (12 oz bottle: Cost Plus in La Jolla, CA) Bought this bottle from Cost Plus, so a rerate might be in order, well see.  It pours a pale orange-golden color and is fully cloudy.  The white head is tall, fluffy and white in color.  Unfortunately, its all downhill from here.  The flavor shows moderate wheat maltiness, and banana starts mild and finishes with more gusto, the clove is in deep hiding the entire time, and it tastes a bit stale and cardboardy.  Not bad, but tastes ""old"".  The nose is funky and fruity when first poured, with no sign of anything resembling a Hefeweizen, but I guess once the funky aromas subside, Im getting more banana.  Light-medium bodied, and lightly carbonated, but the stale flavor just sits on the tongue.  This beer isnt horrible, but I imagine it is much better when purchased at a real beer store.  It definitely improved the longer it sat in the glass (up to a point, obviously).  Based on my experience with beer purchases at this store, I will not spend my money (on beer) there again.

 tried this beer again and it was better than it was previously.  Maybe I got a bad bottle.  Now the spices are a little more pronounced, getting a nice clove/coriander type of spicy taste.

I had this one with cuban black beans and rice, what a combination!!! The cumin-vinegar-cayenne flavors were a perfect opposite to the sweet wheatness of the Hefe -Weizen.

1688,"2004-09-22",3.4,"With many if not most wheat beers the hallmark flavor overwhelms anything else that might be present and leads to a heavy, bland brew. However, this beer is somewhat different - presenting many enjoyable elements to complement the wheat taste. I personally prefer a wheat beer fully carbonated straight from the bottle as complementing flavors seems to come through better. From the bottle Ayinger provides a strong lemony kick and some allspice like elements; from the glass the flavor is more bland but still okay. For the record, it pours a well-defined head that lasts as film to the end of the glass. Aroma is very strong wheat-grass (nice if youre into health food) but also very vinegary. Sort of a candycane aftertaste.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","BeerAteHer"

Luxurious mouthfeel, at first, until I realize that Im drinking the foam. As for the actual beer, smooth, but complex, and delicious wheaty texture. Just enough grit and resistance to keep the tongue busy and happy. 
Though the body has plenty of substance, the overall nature of this brew is light and breezy. Citrus flavor continues through and is felt long through the satisfying finish. 
No lemon needed here, its plentiful in this beautiful brew itself ( and is also extant in the Thai shrimp pad thai that this blissful weizen is helpful to wash down).","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

I think this is best explained by the lack or limit of the spices one usually associates with a Hefe. In so doing, this beer is offering more malt and yeast flavors than most. And while light-bodied and hay-scented (not the fern) it is a wholesome and refreshing beverage. This beer would taste best after a day of bucking hay under the hot summer sun.

Ovreall, a positively delightful brew, not overpowering or offensive, but completely compliant, tasting of vanilla, bending and willing to quench your beer-thirsty desires, to satiate your ever-expanding beerthirst [Bierdurst].

A real summer thirst quencher, somewhere between Schneider Weisse and Hoegaarden, with a twist of Liberty Ale. Should appeal to women as well. Definitely among the very best Hefeweizens out there.

Tastes of sweat spice with a hint of florals. It's very complex but I really can't pick out much else specifically.

Mouthfeel is foamy yet crisp and clean.

Drinkability is pretty good, but I gotta be honest and say that I couldn't have too many of these. It's almost over-carbonated and a tad too sweet to have more than a few.

Very nice loking beer bright yellow and hazy with a very large pure white head.
Lovelly german hefe aroma..but this has more ""spiciness"" than bananas..also more wheat sourness is detetcted than usual.
Tatse is very nice as expected from the aroma the banana taste is muted..but theres an attractive creamyness to the beer, slightly bitter aftertaste.
Strangelly for it having a creamy flavour the mouthfeel doesnt hold out..it becomes rather watery near the end.

Smell has a strong sense of banana at first pour with the clove, but subsides as it sits it becomes more of a regular hefe aroma but still favorable of dullish lemon, yeasty must, and the banana and clove not so potent. Taste is mild and full of a soild hefe, good heft with a frothy bold wheat start that leads into the lemon citrus brigade, quite smooth, lightly sour, calming banana and musty yeast takes some grip as it pushes through into the finish with nice lingering clove. Feel starts easy and smooth and fills up quickly to a pretty solid fullness with a substantially lasting finish. This is one very nice hefe, quite enjoyable, refreshing and flavorful.

1688,"2003-01-03",3.7,"An interesting smack of aroma right from the start....lemons, yeast, fruit, something barnyard-like...id call it hay, sweetness but not maltiness...and that ever apparent wheat smell..pretty complex and intriguing. The pour begins a golden colour, but this is very short lived...for within lies the secret of the little floatie yeasties!!! The danced perilously around my glass, clouding up all i could possibly see and creating an impenetrable gob of golden cloudiness. A head stood above this cloud practically 3 inches high!!!! Foamy, with mild creaminess it stood there like a champion throughout the majority of my enjoyment. The taste begins with a wheaty, yeasty, and spicey smack in the middle of the tongue. Very little sweetness here so the mid portion of your tongue is in for quite an awakening. The finish is interesting, with various fruits becoming apparent which were hidden nicely in the aroma. I catch something orangey, some banana, citrus, and peach-like, and grapefruit (which could be incorporated into the citrus-like category). It ends mildly dry, but not too dry. Probably my only knock here is the carbonation. Its mildly apparent in the pour that this is going to be filled with little bubbles...but the carbonation is a very huge deal here on the way down and inhibits drinkability just enough for a few marks downward on the scale. Those yeast floaties make all the difference in the taste, go grab yourself a bottle and youll be satisfied. Ill grab one if i see it again.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

1688,"2001-11-16",4.0,"Another superb Ayinger product! Definitely one of the best Weisse beers available. Has all the classic aromatic qualities of a great Bavarian Weisse, but also has a fairly hefty body; thick and creamy (I cant describe that as well as de_la_cerveza does in her rating!) Anyway, findit, drink it and enjoy it!","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"
1688,"2001-11-15",4.4,"This is an outstanding brew!  It definately lives up to the Ayinger reputation for great beers.","Jacksonville, North Carolina, USA","Saad"
1688,"2001-11-02",3.9,"mmmm...good.

3 words for ya: HEAD, BANANA, THICK

ok, that sounds kind of kinky, but im serious!!!

this was another beer that shows why german wheats are so much more superior to american microbrewed wheats. (other than north coasts pranqster which is right up there)","Florida, USA","delacerveza"
1688,"2001-11-01",3.8,"Super smooth with a great fruity, sweet flavor.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","michaelm18"
1688,"2001-10-16",4.0,"Light and refreshing; perfect for a hot summer day. Mild lemon flavor that doesnt obtrude. Worth the two bucks even if you dont usually go for this style.","LaVista, Nebraska, USA","K-V-F-L"
1688,"2001-10-12",4.2,"I rarely would call a beer too smooth but that is the only fault I can find with this wonderful hefe.  Big, big nose of cardamom, cloves, lemon fits perfectly with a great-looking glass of slightly cloudy, huge-headed (meringue-like), lemon-wheat ambrosia.  Perhaps it could use just a bit more hops, and it might be a bit thick for a hefe; but these are quibbles-after youve had Paulaner and Hoegaarden, make this your next wheat/white stop.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1688,"2001-10-01",3.9,"Big creamy hefe head, cloudy, yellow, with and aroma of cloves and subtle banana. Very rick, creamy and smooth, excellent body and mouthfeel, lots of carbonation. Mild banana,wheat and cloves in the palate, the thing that sets this aside from other wheats is that this beer finishes thick, not thin and water like others, its very good!","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
1688,"2001-09-28",4.4,"This is probably the best hefe that I have ever had. Very nice body that lasts through the whole glass. Sweetness will arise about half way through with just a touch of citrus.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
1688,"2001-09-28",3.4,"Okay weisse beer.  More dominant clove than most weisses, perhaps appropriate to the style (Bavarian)?  Mild fruity esthers like apple and banana creep up here and there.","Rutland, Vermont, USA","canary dog"
1688,"2001-09-04",4.2,"Remarkably satisfying wheat beer, a benchmark for the style. I cant add much to what other raters have said so well, but you should definitely familiarize yourself with this Brau-Weisse.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","baseballguy"
1688,"2001-08-02",3.1,"This beer looked great: nifty bottlecap gave way to let me pour a nice cloudy brew with an amazing head. But the nose was pure banana, and the flavor a bit thin. Not really much spiciness there, just a bit of a dry sweet malty taste. Im thinking this one had spent a bit too much time on the shelf.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
1688,"2001-07-01",3.9,"Smooth, creamy, tasty wheat.  Nice palate.  A rather elegant beer.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

1688,"2001-05-17",4.1,"I found this to have a somewhat different flavor than some other top notch hefes.  The flavor profile seems to be dominated by grapefruit citrus flavors, but lacks some of the mild spiciness in other hefes.  The aroma profile is exactly what youd expect from a top notch hefe and it had a good, thick head which stuck around almost to the last sip.  Wonderful cloudy deep straw color.  I greatly enjoyed this beer, and I am not a big fan of the style.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"
1688,"2001-05-14",2.7,"UPDATED: APR 26, 2005 Lively gold.  Aroma is sweaty, with hints of clove and banana.  The palate is fairly sweet, with hints of plastic amid the standard dusty yeast notes and banana.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1688,"2001-05-08",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2010 Re-rate.  Poured from bottle. Nice lemon meringue aroma.  Opaque gold, white head.  Creamy with citrus pepper and spice.  Still a great one.","York, SC via NJ, South Carolina, USA","HighlanderOne"
1688,"2001-04-22",4.3,"It is murder trying to decide which German brewerys hefe is the best.  Weihenstephan, Scheiner Weisse, Franziskaner, Paulaner, Ayinger: they all put out top-notch wheat beers.  This one is a little lighter than its brethren, and maybe a little more citric in taste.  It is, of course, very quenching and extremely refreshing.  A cold one of these on a summer afternoon would not go amiss.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
1688,"2001-04-02",4.3,"One of the top aromas in Hefes.  The head was a lot thinner than Ive come to expect per style, and the appearence suffered a bit because the yeast did not dissipate as evenly as it should have (tended to clump up).  Make no mistake about the flavor though, this is a top notch Hefe.  Wheaty, fruity, and refreshing.  Highly recommended.","Portland, Maine, USA","Sammys"
1688,"2001-03-04",4.2,"This is up there for wheat beers.  That unmistakeable Weihenstephaner aroma and spiciness.  Seemed to have a little more body than Weihenstephaner and a little more flavor overall.  Still does not beat Allagash White, but something any serious wheat beer drinker should not pass up.","Acworth, Georgia, USA","billb"
