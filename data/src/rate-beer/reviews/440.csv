440,"2014-12-13",3.2,"Bottle. An unclear orange beer with a dense, two-finger off-white head leaving lacings. The aroma is quite fruity, with some pale malts and pine cones. Its rather thin on the palate, almost medium bodied, with a nice carbonation. Rather bitter flavor with fruityness and some pale malts. Lasting finish. Nothing special going on, but quite nice anyway. Sort of refreshing. 141213","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

440,"2013-09-04",3.8,"It feels a bit daft to claim that a beer is underrated (""hey, I know better than you lot, even though I have far fewer ratings than most of you and this is my very first cream ale""), but pretty please with hops on top, why on earth hasnt this one a far better rating? It looks nice, it pours a medium amber, hazy body with a large, dense and creamy off-white head that is long-lived and laces the glass well. The aroma is very inviting indeed! Its strong and sweet with huge amounts of fruits and berries, especially strawberries with a lovely tropical background. Also crisp orange notes to liven things up a bit. The taste is moderate to light sweet and moderate to light bitter. The quite strong flavours follow the aroma, I really like this red berries/tropical fruits combo. The mouthfeel is stunning, it has a remarkable smooth and creamy texture, the body is medium and the carbonation is soft. A light dryness in the finish. A more-ish and highly drinkable beer!
