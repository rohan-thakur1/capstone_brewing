1492,"2017-03-15",4.2,"Thanks to Michael for this unique brew! Je dis unique car elle ne ressemble en rien à ce que jai lhabitude de boire. Beau look noir et franchement liquoreux, huileux et riche. Ça tombe lourdement et ça remue peu lorsque je fais tanguer mon verre. La mousse ne tient que trop peu. Détranges parfums umami et presque fromagers, sans fumée. Ça sent le bois chauffé mais pas la fumée, le tout enrobé darômes qui rappelle la sauce aux huîtres que lon retrouve dans plusieurs sauces asiatiques. Cest très étrange et personne ne peut sattendre à cela à mon avis. Mouthfeel de feu: riche, ontueux, crémeux et plein de nuances. Cest presque laiteux alors que le bois chauffé sexprime à merveille, belle effervescence malgré une texture huileuse et matte. Un semblant de sirop dérables et de poêle à bois. Longue en bouche et jamais réellement fumée, lamertume du café est douce et légère. Jaime vraiment ça. Jaurais aimé la faire découvrir à dautres mais bon, je me suis domé ça solo en rentrant de pelleter. Cheers all!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

1492,"2015-03-02",3.5,"On tap at the brewery. Pours dark brown with a tan head. Chocolate sauce and chili flakes in the aroma. Whoa. Lots of coffee and sugar but also a strange note of some sort of Thai sauce that I cant put my finger on. Sweet and slightly savory. Weird. Distracting.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
1492,"2015-02-13",4.3,"On tap at Cellarmaker. It pours a dark brown color with a light tan head. The aroma is creamy, milky coffee ice cream. The flavor is the same. More coffee roast in the finish with some tobacco and smoke. Coffee ice cream is what I keep coming up with It has a very palatable, creamy body. Super good.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
1492,"2015-02-09",4.4,"Yes yes yes! At first the smoke was almost unnoticeable, but the coffee was so good I didnt care...but when it opened up, the kiss of smoke was just enough to lend a level of complexity and deliciousness that I loved. This stronger version is just as insanely smooth as the base.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
1492,"2015-02-07",4.0,"On tap at the Brewpub. Black with a small tan head. Aroma and taste of coffee, light smoke, some ash and dark chocolate. Low carbonation and with an almost full body. A pleasant one to sip.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","gyllenbock"
1492,"2015-01-26",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2016 Black in color. Light brown head, smallish. Fades pretty quickly but its a small bar pour. Mild neutral smoke. Lots of chocolate, some caramel, a little graham cracker. Tasty dessert stuff. Fairly sweet. Really nice flavor. Big on chocolate with light but firm bitterness. Light smoke, really helps cut the sweetness. Nice thick feel, fairly low carbonation, I think. Im never quite sure if these bigger beers are actually lower carb or just heavier.  New batch 12/6/2016 (bottles) - Even better than past batches.  Real, real good.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
1492,"2014-11-14",4.2,"Draft sampled at the festival LA 2014 with Linh and Scarlett. Pours a deep brownish black body with thin spotty white lacing. Aroma is rich vanilla, earthy roast, chocolate and light smoke. Mouthfeel is perfectly balanced between light earthy smoke and sweet chocolate. Incredible porter nearly in the same league as FB Last Snow.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
1492,"2014-11-09",3.8,"P: Black with a thin brown head. S: Coffee and light smoke and caramel. T: Light coffee, cream, roasted malts in the back and light smoke. M: Soft and very thin. O: Well done, it taste like an 5 abv beer, im shocked at how strong this one is.","South Gate, California, USA","toxichop"
1492,"2014-10-25",4.1,"From notes taken while drinking at the anniversary party. 
Aroma is fairly roasty with quite a bit of coffee. Light chocolate, smoke and leather notes. Hints of alcohol. 
Pours black with a faint tan head that quickly disappears. No lacing and moderate legs. 
Flavor is somewhat sweet with moderately strong roast and coffee notes. Smokiness is light and compliments nicely without ever taking too much attention away from the other notes. Medium light chocolate and light leather character. Medium light bitterness and light alcohol warmth. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium low carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a really nice imperial stout. The smoke character is really well balanced and inoffensive and adds a nice complexity tot he coffee and roast notes. Tons of fresh coffee.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

1492,"2014-10-11",3.9,"Growler. Black in color with a small tan head. Huge awesome coffee and sweet chocolate aroma with some roast. Smooth flavor, huge sweetened coffee with ash, which adds a slight sour note. Medium-full bodied and barely carbonated with an exceptionally slick mouthfeel.
