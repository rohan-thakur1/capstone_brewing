4236,"2014-10-07",3.8,"Shared 12.7 oz. bottle poured to snifters, showing a cloudy, orangey amber color, with a modest layer of soft white head foam, and light lacing. The aroma was a pungent berry & yeast scent at first, then checked again to discover a raspberry scent that seemed to combine with the slightest hint of chocolate to form a pleasant, candy sweetness, along with notable tartness. Light to medium bodied, the carbonation was lively, the flavor retained the fruity raspberry, the tartness that had an oaky/tannic nature to it, included some vinous qualities, and finished smooth, with a pleasant dryness. Liked the quirky inconsistencies, or should I say, complexity, and found this quite tasty.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

4236,"2012-05-16",3.6,"UPDATED: AUG 13, 2012 Rerate, shared 375 ml green capped bottle at local tasting. ABV is 8.8%. Hazy brownish red colour, moderate white head with a pinkish hue. Interesting aroma of ripe and over-ripe raspberries, grapes and oak (Sauternes barrel). Fruity and fairly mild flavour, some acidity, raspberries of course, the Sauternes barrel is there, but does not dominate. Hardly any bitterness. I know this is not intended as a bitter beer, but a little more hops wouldnÂ’t hurt. Original rating: 375 ml shared green bottle at hotel room tasting, thanks to Rune. Ruby colour, moderate off-white head. Complex and interesting aroma, brettanomyces, mild spices, vinous notes. Medium sweet flavour, notes of red wine vinegar.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"

Medium body, again completely dominated by the raspberries, leaving a subtle tartness. Some late alcohol.
