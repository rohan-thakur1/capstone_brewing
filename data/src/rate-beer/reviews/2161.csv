2161,"2017-05-04",4.5,"Oh, this beer invokes some childhood memories, it looks, smells and tastes almost the same as the homebrew my grandpa used to brew in his countryhouse a long time ago... True Estonian tradition :) 
On tap at Koht. Pours opaque yellow, looks like orange juice with milk in it. Top is thick and clear white but fades away in few minutes. 
Aroma is very unusual - very yeasty, apples, overripe bananas, lemons and... boiled eggs. Bit the eggs fade away. 
Taste is actually really good - it feels thick and medium carbonated, sweet-sour with mild hop bitterness. There is yeast, apple juice, cinnamon, cottage cheese and sweet grapefruit in the taste. Overall a very nice beer. No alcohol in the taste, although this beer is quite strong. Nice!","Tallinn, ESTONIA","CaskSensei25"

The beer had a very cloud straw-yellow-tan blended color with a large, foamy white head that had good retention, lacing, and cling. Its aroma had a floral and fruity blend with lighter citrus and lemon tones, along with some light banana, straw, and wheat scents. It was a somewhat sour beer with a straw and grain character mixed with some bitter earthy and floral flavors.

Ive had it a number of times since, from the fermenter, at the brewery outlet, in Tallinn, and again at home from PET bottle. What strikes me is that its never the same beer twice, even if some things are constant. The original rating is pretty good, but there is more juniper flavour than I noticed the first time, and the hot peppery thing has never appeared again. Also, a lot of the green, earthy, musty flavour is very like the Lithuanian raw ales, and so probably from the brewing process. Its a very good beer, though, and deserves to be considered a farmhouse classic.","Oslo, NORWAY","larsga"

2161,"2014-08-17",2.2,"Tap at Põrgu in Tallinn ( 2,6 for 33 cl). An opaque light orange (looks like sea buckthorn juice) with a modest white head that drops fast. Nose strikes me at first as something plasticky and burnt, dirty, rotten, vile, fermented, terribly acrid, and on top of that boozy... But its also doughy, yeasty and strangely sweet. Taste is... like something gone bad - apples (as in home-made apple juice), nuts, peach. Sourish, grainy, cidery, autumny. Tastes like its been brewed by some guys great uncle in his ramshackle dacha back in the 1980s. Full body, dry palate, medium carbonation. Sticky mouthfeel. A sharp, acrid finish. Probably the strangest beer Ive ever had, but mind you, my experiences on the ""wild side of beer"" are not that great.

Opaque, cloudy pastel dusty orange with a 1-finger creamy off-white head and excellent lacing. 

Aroma of cider, bananas foster, cloves, earthy yeast, orange, caramel and spices. As the beer warms, the more the cider aroma fades and the more an overripe banana flavor becomes more prominent. 

Taste of bananas foster, clove, wheat, spices, earthy yeast, apple, orange, very sweet caramel, pineapple and a hint of juniper.

2161,"2012-03-11",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2016 My Bottom Line:
This frothy Koduõlu delivers plenty of cereal flavors atop banana esters and scrumpy-like fruitiness and earthy funk.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sticky head of foam covers the cloudy beige-y white.
-The drying finish shares light wooden juniper notes.
-The mouthfeel is very comfortable, creamy and soft.
-After having compared to a dozen other examples from Saaremaa and Hiiumaa, I truly think this Pihtla is a good ambassador to Koduõlu.

location. Hazy yellow-gold pour with a touch of sweet banana. More tart thanit was the first time around. A little bit of sour banana and a little bit of odd sweaty dank flavour. Its more tart and less herbal/spicy than the first time around, but its equally interesting.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

Flavor was riped banana, sweat, lots of yeast. Sweet long finish. Interesting, but as sahti isn´t really my favourite style, this one didn´t really cause any hoorays.","Vantaa, FINLAND","Hermod"

2161,"2011-02-14",2.9,"Surprisingly good traditional ale from Baltics. Aroma has banana, tart, alcohol, dark fruits, apricot, date and plum. Little light, but Im comparing this to sahti. Why? I dont know.","Helsinki, FINLAND","Brandman"

Flavor has that same paint, floorboard, herbal alchol, hint turpentine, ice-creamy maltiness similar to Lammin sahti, just a lot drier. Soft and yeasty palate.

Draught (SOPP2009)
Day 1 - Pale, cloudy, tiny head. Leafy juniper aroma. Full smooth body. Hugely herby and vegetal taste - herby grassy retronasals. Long grassy bitter finish. Dry compared to a sahti, and with more details. Good light grains.
Day 2 - Much sweeter and closer to Finnish sahti.
Day 3 - Back to being dry and even more vegetal.
Rerate: Tap (Porgu, Tallinn) (7:4:7:4:15=3.7)
Looks like a full-bodied cloudy wheat beer, small tight persistent head. Best sample ever, So wheaty, but tons of herbal juniper. Full and smooth. Delicious, so fresh, so goddamn fresh. This is what the brewer drinks. Gorgeous.  I have had about 100 pints of this which I didnt rerate, but I finally realised I should tell the world how dam good this beer is when fresh.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
2161,"2009-08-01",3.4,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2012 (Re-rate, draught at Põrgu, 20120704) The beer poured orange and cloudy. Its head was small and white. Aroma had juniper, malts and yeast.

(Draught at SOPP 2009) Orange and very cloudy. Small white head. Fruitiness, sweetness and boiled vegetables in aroma. Quite light and dry palate with medium carbonation. Malts, sweetness, juniper and lightly vegetables in taste. Old score: 3.2","Helsinki, FINLAND","mjs"

Light brown/yellow colour with small off-white head.

2161,"2005-12-23",3.9,"Oak cask, handbottled
This is original farmhouse ale from Saaremaa island, Estonia - their version of Finnish sahti - ""taluõlu"" (=house beer) or ""koduõlu"" (=home beer). This is made from barley malts, juniper, baking yeast and Hallertau-hops. Very interesting brew for my 2000th rating.
Pale hazy yellow-orange color, not much head. Strong dry nose of  junipers. Medium-bodied. Flat but crisp, citric notes. Juniper and oaky flavors dominate, typical sahti-like fruity esters, especially in the finish. Very (dangerously) drinkable, alcohol gives nice kick but is not dominating. Overall fantastic sahti - as good as its Finnish brothers - I would like to join Õlletoober (Saaremaa sahti festival) next summer.","Pori, FINLAND","TBone"
