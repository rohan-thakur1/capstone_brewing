3579,"2017-05-12",3.9,"Can poured into a stange, the appearance was simple hazy orange color. Slight little lace after a quickly moving little white foamy head obliterated itself as a usual gose.
The aroma had sweet and tart lime up front, some mineral notes, sour-ed wheat, pie crust/biscuits.
The flavor leaned to the tart side initially with a decent little wheat bite developing and letting in some of that pie crust/biscuit-like quality that I first smelled. Light aftertaste of the lime and that pie crust/biscuits. No finish.
The feel was light bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt appropriate.
