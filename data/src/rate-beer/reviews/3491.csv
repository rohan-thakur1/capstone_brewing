3491,"2016-12-24",3.8,"Draft: Poured an orange brown with white head. Strong malt aroma. This one taste is super grainy and awesome. Very bold for such a low abv.","Wasilla, Alaska, USA","SHIG"
3491,"2016-08-23",3.8,"on draft at brewery. A highly drinkable, lightly toasty but nuanced mild ale. Strangely addictive. Very interesting.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3491,"2016-07-18",3.5,"Roasted nature of the malt (chocolate and crystal malts). Nice lacing. Refreshing for a brown ale. Beautiful coloration. Chestnut undertones.","Seattle, Washington, USA","mintzmeet"
3491,"2016-07-03",2.8,"Serving: from tap at the Masonry.

Aroma: light malt and coffee.

Appearance: very small, off-white, initial head with no lacing and fully diminishing longevity. Clear, dark-orange/light brown body.

Taste: lightly sweet, coffee initial flavor and lightly acidic, nutty finish with short duration.

Palate: light body, watery texture and soft carbonation.

Overall: a little too mild for my taste.","Washington, USA","Hanuta06"
3491,"2016-06-03",3.7,"(En fût à la source): Des esters fruités en support à une base biscuit, légèrement mélasse et doté dune immense buvabilité. Un aspect minéral enveloppe agréablement les céréales.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
3491,"2016-05-23",3.7,"Draft pour at Holy Mountain, listed as 3%. 3% with a ton of flavor going on. Copper pour with a fading head. Toasted nut and caramel aroma. Roasted malt with a light beer feel. Very toasty. Wood character. Cherry notes throughout. Mild sweet malt linger. Gets better with every sip. Tasty.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
3491,"2016-05-19",3.8,"Draft at HM. Rosy brown, white soapy foam. Mild, sharp sweet malt aroma. Clean, very crisp with a very dry finish. Bitter dark malts but so clean and snappy. A bit too bitter for my taste, but really good roast, really tasty and grows on me.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
3491,"2015-08-05",3.8,"Draft at SB. Pours a murky and very ebony with a dense and creamy light tan head that sticks around for a while. Bit toasty nose, showing brown bread crusts, a slight hint of coffee, and roasted peanuts. Creamy medium body with lively carb. Toasty mid palate, showing nice toasty bread crusts and nutty notes with a bit of semi-sweet dark chocolate on the mid palate. Mild roasty, nutty finish. Very nice.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
3491,"2015-07-10",3.6,"Tap at brewery, dark brown, ring of foam. Aroma coffee and chocolate. Taste is toasted barley, coffee, caramel. Nice. This could almost be called a porter. Palate is light but smooth. Finish dry. Nice!","Eagle River, Alaska, USA","furthur"
3491,"2015-07-10",3.6,"On tap at Holy Mountain. Dark, cola brown pour. Nose brings more warm, toasty malt than most imperial porters. Hazelnuts, chocolate, and toasted grains. Flavor is remarkably full for 3.7% (is that even possible?!). The malt bill comes through beautifully in here, and while its just a tad dilute, this is really impressive. I think Id still take a pale, but if you liked the roastier side of flavors and wanted a ""hot summer day"" brew, this is absolutely it.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"
3491,"2015-07-06",3.8,"Draft at HM (also enjoyed at a few other spots around town since the time I took these notes). Clear garnet brown pour. Ring of white head. Toffee, chocolate, caramel, nutty aroma. Light body feels a little thin but not out of line (especially considering style and low ABV). Lightly to moderately sweet, featuring caramel, nuts, and biscuit. Flavor is great. Im a fan of low alcohol malt-driven dark beers, and am so happy to have a beer like this being brewed locally.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
3491,"2015-06-28",3.9,"Had on tap at The Masonry in Queen Anne. Nice brown appearance with a lasting head, that as the previous reviewer mentioned, never fades. Wonderfully light, biscuit, baked bread, mildly roasty aroma. Smelled more alcoholic than it is. Moderate whifs of a hop profile that lends to a nice bite. This beer was refreshing. Light texture with a mild hop bite. Baked bread, biscuit, a little roast/burnt flavor. The bitterness was a lingering one, but not over-powering. This beer was crisp, refreshing, and had a great flavor. Reading the previous reviewers review, I did see he mentioned diacetyl, and now that I think about it, there was a SLIGHT hint of that, but as he also mentions, it worked well with the aforementioned flavors. Overall, great beer, and Im happy that theyre located right up the street. I could drink this beer all day, for sure.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"
3491,"2015-06-11",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2015 Half pint at Bottleworks. Its not fair, how is this brewery able to make such a nice mild? Clear dark brown with a long lasting head that never fades. Aroma is dark woodsy malts, light diacetyl, lightly burnt brown malts (dark bread crust), no sugar and light malt sweetness. Body is soooo light yet a burst of flavor. Again, light diacetyl, black bread crust, watery buckwheat. Flavor fades, mellow carbonation. The diacetyl is perfect in this beer, the flavor is strong despite light body.  This is what I want in my mild.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
