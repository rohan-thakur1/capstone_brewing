I picked out apples, berries, orange peel, raisins and a hint of vanilla in the taste. Normally Id be delighted with a mixture like that, but this dubbel just didnt hang together well enough on the tongue. Its not as drinkable as the best of this style and its individual elements didnt converge well enough. A good effort but not in the top tier.","Cheshire, ENGLAND","Nocturne"

577,"2012-10-27",3.4,"Bottle from the brewery. Very fresh.  Its not what I would expect from a dubbel.  Its a little sharper and almost stout like.  It dark brown letting only a little light through.  Big frothy head dissipates quickly with no lasting lace.  The aroma is earthy but mostly fresh toasted rye bread.  The flavor is a slightly lactic and with a lot of almost smoky grain and pepper.  I get a little ginger and fruit but not much of the dark fruit, sweet bready malt and yeast character of a typical dubbel.

577,"2012-10-16",3.8,"0.75l bottle from CrackedKettle. Been savoring this for a while now. It immediately after popping the cap fills the air with a sweet light dubbel-yeasty aroma. It pours a heavy cloudy dark amber-brown body with a really good looking big dense and heavy lacing light beige head. As mentioned the aroma is really present in this one - even if its almost as good as fridge-cold. Fruity and sweet with a clear acidic twitch, sticky raisins, really malty and quite delicious. In the taste I get first a sweet malty base with chocolate hints and some acidic touches, then it gets a bit more yeasty before it continues with lots of sour green gooseberries, oxidization , banana sweetness, a soft gentle hint of red wine vinegar and a little bit of mossy wood and alcohol. Not to sour overwhelming or anything, but there is a soft sour cream-like flavor in the finish that Im not sure it should have been here. Still, I fancy both that and the beer itself.

A - Very dark/brown body. Somewhat clear when held up to the light. One finger dirty light tan head that sticks around forever. Excellent lacing and retention.

S - Not too far off from genuine Belgian dubbels or strong ales. Chewy figs, cherries, ripe bananas, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and bready yeast. Like other reviewers I am getting some faint earthy mint.

T - Starts off with bready malts, caramelized figs, bananas, and cherries. Layers of mint, earthy grass, tobacco and spicy yeast. Kind of watery and muddled with an acetic soured malt aftertaste. Mouth feel is light to medium, with silky carbonation and a noticeable alcohol presence.

O - Kind of a let down. Appearance wise it looks excellent, and the aroma was rather impressive for an American brewed dubbel...but the flavors and mouth feel just fell flat. Watery, thin, unbalanced flavors, and a harsh aftertaste.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Pours nice hazy reddish orange color with a fairly dense 2 finger khaki head with amazing retention that reduces to a thick lacing cap.  Some bits of lacing cling to the glass as well.  Tons of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass.  Aromas of huge grape juice, raisin, molasses, caramel, chocolate, nuttiness, and spices.  Huge aromas here I could smell as soon as I poured it.  Nice stuff.  Taste of big white grape, caramel, toasted malt, pepper, spices, bread, and molasses up front; with some chocolate and nutty notes near the finish.  A slight bit of tartness in the back adds a different aspect to this, with lingering notes of chocolate, nuttiness, spices, molasses, and caramel.  Finish is excellent, not too dry, leaving a nice amount of linger flavors.  Nice balance of flavors as well.  Alcohol is nicely hidden with none noticed except for a small warming on the finish.

This one poured a cloudy, caramel brown color with a red hue and topped by a huge head of tan colored foam that slowly recedes to a thin film leaving jagged lines of lace around the glass. The aroma is malt forward with sweet chocolate, toasted caramel, toffee, and nougat all layered together. There is also some light raisins and figs in there to give a nice fruit character to things. The flavor follows suit with the toasted caramel and sweet nougat malts blending nicely with the raisins, figs, and plums. There is not much hops to speak of, but the belgian yeast keeps things from getting overly sweet. Nearly full bodied with subtle carbonation that leads to a sweet caramel covered raisin finish.

Poured into a tulip. Appearance is amber-brown with a light head and some mild lacing with staying power. Nose is dark fruits, toast, and a bit of spicing. The flavor is malty with some dark drugs and yeast. Good body with nice carbonation and a touch of heat. Drinkability is good, though I could have used a bit more complexity.

The nose is somewhat hard to smell due to carbonation, but there are underlying aromas of caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, stewed fig, walnut, date and just a hint of fruity yeast.  The flavor is very malty and sweet up front with caramel and brown sugar, moving to more of the date and fig, and the walnut coming through nicely, and a bit of bitterness coming through on the back.

577,"2011-02-07",2.8,"Poured into a snifter.

4.0 A: Lightly hazed dark amber color. Little yeasties or something uniformly throughout. Three fingers of off-white frothy head with good retention and plenty of lacing.

2.5 S: Smells like a saison as opposed to a dubbel. Barnyard funk and peppery yeastiness are by far the strongest aromas. Light apple fruitiness. I dont know how this is as dark as it is without smelling like anything associated with beers this color. Pretty boring.

3.0 T: At least this tastes like a dubbel. Unfortunately it isnt a very good one. Toffee, light raisin and plum fruitiness, some tobacco. A bit more bitter than Id like. Again, theres some funkiness in the form of muskiness. It doesnt really work in this beer though because there isnt enough spiciness or dark fruitiness in the forefront. Some peppery yeast.

3.5 M: Light to lighter medium body. A bit too much carbonation, which is pretty active and spritzy. Could be a bit smoother due to the carbonation.

3.0 D: Ive certainly had better dubbels than this. Now at least I know better about this one. Theres really nothing good about it.

Edit: It tastes a hell of a lot better with the yeast mixed in, but the bottle didnt state to do that, so the scores stand.

Sweet cherries come through in the taste, with big sweet malt, lemon, honey, and dark roast on the finish. Its a bit syrupy, and the fruity sweetness is a bit too much for my tastes.

Sweetness is mellow, however, not cloying, and reminiscent of a good aged port.  Lingering yeasty breadiness on the finish, and the slightest twinge of hops adding some bitterness.

577,"2009-11-25",3.4,"750 ml bottle courtesy of either TheEpeeist or LilBeerDoctor. Thanks, guys! Pours a nice dark dulled amber, a bit brighter around the edges, pretty hazy, with a very large light brown/tan head, laces ok, very good retention though. Aromas are a nice vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, a light duller Belgian yeasty spice, apples, banana, delicate with a touch of cake. Initial is medium bodied, fruity with apple, pear, banana esters taking up residence. Some light brown sugar, cake, and vanilla in a small amount come in, a decent yeasty spice, a bit dulled, with fruits coming in stronger further into the body. To me, this is a lighter bodied dubbel, maltiness comes towards the backend, caramel, cereal, and a pretty noticeable bitterness on the backend. Not overly boozy, spice starts to permeate a bit more. Not a bad Dubbel overall, although Id have liked a little more life and body. A bit toasty, fruity, pretty good though overall.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Flavor is very malty, focusing on raisins and figs. The first few sips suffered from a sharp, somewhat oxidized off-note, but this quickly faded. As the glass continued, a spicy aromatic-bitter element somewhere between cardamom and mint entered in, especially towards the finish, and provided nice balance to the malt backbone. Medium to full body, very smooth, distinctly warming.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","noncaloric"

A touch of wet leaf pile and earth.  Brown sugar and a bit of wet paper bag as well. As the beer opens, a blast of green apple with some mildly phenolic yeast hits the nose. Flavor is a balanced mix of malt and yeast. Brown sugar, caramel, fruit leather and tobacco. The yeast yields a bit of lacto creaminess on the tongue. Apple skin. Slightly earthy.

577,"2008-09-19",3.5,"Draught @ Beer Table, Brooklyn. Pours a clear, dark red brown with just a bit of a head. Nose is licorice and dark fruits, a bit of caramelized brown sugar. Taste is much the same - yeast is subdued for the style, made up for by a pronounced licorice note, dark fruits and caramelized brown sugar, moving to a toasty bread crust as well. Mouthfeel is just a hair thin, medium to start with moderate carbonation, thinning out on the finish. There’s a definite dopplebock characteristic to this one as well, almost like a dubbel-bock. Clean where it should be spicy, licorice where there should be yeasty. Very interesting and different take on an abbey dubbel.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","JohnQPublic"

The aroma is sweet with dark fruits- maple, fig, brown sugar, dark Belgian malts and a buttery toffee/chocolate note. Creamy on the palate. The flavor is initially sweet with maple and brown sugar, along with sweet raisiny notes as well. Then it’s followed by some toasted, dark Belgian malt character, as well as a subtle fruit note of dark berries? Toward the finish there’s a nuance of smoked (peat-like) character with a mildly bitter/roasted finish. A balanced and well executed example of the style.

An original dubbel that is just as captivating as their tripel.


I like:
Gorgeous aroma. Incredible black grape concentration. Pure black grapes, seed included! Ive never encountered the like in beer. Captivating cognac notions. Plummy. Very pleasant and perfumey. Juicy by its mere fruitiness. Gentle cherry notes in the background. Surprisingly growing bitterness, serving as a firm backbone and limiting the sweetness growth. Toasty. Cleansing carbonation, very active, almost biting. Tiny grap skin astringency.

Interesting, lightly spicy and moderately inviting. Pours a reddish-brown, half-hazed with a growing prosperous head in silky tan. Flavor is rich, but bites a little. Theres a curt tannic ring to the beer that ebbs acidic. This carries over a bed of mature dry fruits, raisin and Frangelico. Complexity and spice, with a high yeast profile. Rather signature of Abbey styles. Theres a bit of a battle for the lead character of the beer. Mature fruit, sustained spice, or alcohol sugars. Hops give a beautiful afterglow in heavenly resin that just rounds the beer delightfully. Im confused by the mid-palate of the beer. Theres a lot going on and the sensation is perplexing. The carbonation is extremely soft and diffusive. However, theres a palpable astringency to the body that throws me off throughout the beer. This keeps it down a little. Nonetheless, its the most faithfully produced example of the style, with remarkable depth and complexity, yet maintaining drinkability in its freshness and conditioning.

Bottled: 2006

Ive been sitting on this bottle for a little over a year now. A quiet pfftt as I pop the top. An aggressive pour brought about a thick ring and island of head swirling around the glass. The head that did form disappeared quickly leaving a thing ring. The body is a somewhat murky reddish-brown. 

The aroma, although not bad, just doesnt seem to jive with the style. Caramel malt is present and forms a solid base. We get offline with a big nose of green apple along with some other orchard fruit its hard to put my finger on. The caramel is deep and rich. 

Flavor starts off a little shyly but before you know it caramel and spicy alcohol come along. There seems to be some of those orchard fruits in the flavor as well and they just dont get along with the caramel sweetness. Things seem to weaken again on the swallow. Jut not a very good example of a dubbel. Alcohol seems to be a little too prominent.

The body doesnt stand up to what a dubbel should be either. Too thin and slightly watery. Could stand a burst of carbonation on the tongue.

Not a very drinkable beer. The flavor just isnt where it should be. One glass is enough for me.

A real disappointment from Captain Lawrence. Everything else Ive sampled from them has been top notch. Unfortunatley, this offering falls far short.

577,"2007-09-20",3.8,"Bottled 2006, Sampled September 2007
Pours with a frothy, initially three-finger thick, tightly beaded, tan colored head that sits atop a drab, opaque, dark plum colored beer, but which shows a brilliantly clear, bright cranberry color when held up to the light.  The aroma is quite fruity smelling, with notes of blackberries, sweet plums and cherries being noticeable as the beer sits on the table in front of me.  When I go in for a closer inspection of the nose, I get concentrated malt notes as well as the previously noticed fruit notes.  Aromas of caramelized malt, brown sugar, a lightly concentrated malt note that evokes thoughts of an umami-like savoriness, toasty grain, lightly-browned soda crackers make up the distinctly malt derived components.  The malt, obviously heavily influences the fruit aromatic components of this brew too.  The fruit character also yields aromas of raisins, prunes, concentrated-caramelized apples and a bright berry like note.  The aroma is quite nice and quite rich; I could certainly wish for a bit more spicy yeast influence, but it is really quite good.

Despite being fairly well carbonated, the beer has a soft creaminess to it up front.  The carbonation then kicks in and helps to lighten the beers effect on the palate as well as adding a zippy frothiness to the brew as it flows past the tongue.  It is fairly sweet and fruity tasting, though not overly so and in fact dries out to a soft sweetness after the first sip or so.  The finish is interesting though, with a definite dark malt influence that leans towards darkly browned toasted bread and even an astringency from the toasted influence.  This adds a bit of sharpness to the finish.   Speaking of sharpness there is a spicy note in the finish as well; flavor notes from higher alcohols, a touch of phenolics and ginger/clove like note that gives me the sensation of a tongue numbing.  Actually that tongue numbing note is really reminding me of the sensation I had last night when accidentally chewing on a clove that was in my bowl of Pho.  This has ample fruit notes to it, with flavors of prunes, raisins, touches of dried figs and concentrated berry flavors all being noticeable.  The body of this beer has a light-medium heft to it; it impacts the palate well with lingering flavors, yet remains quite light feeling.  Strangely enough, I would not classify this beer as quaffable; it seems to have the body for that, but somehow the flavor impact is too large for me to feel comfortable with quaffing this brew (this is most definitely a good thing, given the alcohol percentage of this brew).

This is quite tasty, it has quite a bit more darker grain notes in it than is typical (especially towards the finish), but these notes mostly add another dimension to this brew.  While the aroma is not overly so, the flavor definitely has some heavy spiciness to it (though I wouldnt guess this is anything more than fermentation character).  Fairly rich tasting, yet the overall experience of this beer remains surprisingly light.  Either Dubbels are finally beginning to grow on me (Dubbels have been one of the few Belgian Styles I have not really been exited about), or this is just enough different from the typical example that I am really enjoying this right now.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

577,"2007-04-23",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2007 2006 bottling: Rusty orange. Bottle conditioning yields a broken layer of clingy dirty-white foam. Red licorice, rum-soaked raisins and plasticy phenols comprise the aroma, with sweet hints of chocolate cake and caramelized malt underneath. Very brightly fruity. Airy on the palate with expressive, yet snug, carbonation. Resoundingly malty, initially, and succulently fruity, with a caramel-drizzled fudge cake richness which is gently displaced by a vivaciously phenolic accompaniment. Medicinal alcohol generates substantial chest warmth, but doesnt overly detract. Clean attenuation, coupled with trace unripe plum acidity, helps to add lift and refreshment. Malt is deceptively pronounced, but flashes of  graininess do exude. Extremely clean, though a glimpse of waxy yeast appears which accentuates the sugared-cranberry sweetness. Finishes slightly medicinally astringent, but dryish and mostly nuanced with hints of rummy raisins, candy apples, plum skin, and deeply caramelized malt. A delightfully clean and well-attenuated rendition.  Maybe a bit alcoholic, but the malt is complex yet occasionally subtle, and the sweetness and yeastiness are thankfully reserved.

577,"2007-02-24",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2007 Batch 1.  750 ml bottle.  Very clear light brown beer with a thick pillowy head.  Aroma is excellent with a sweet and vineous character.  Oaky and fruity with cherry, red grapes, bubble gum, clove and a bit of sweet rummy brown sugar character.  Very fruity and practically oozes ripe berries (blackberry, cherry, strawberry).  Some sweet bready malts that are both toasty and add a chewy palate to the brew.  Flavour matches the aroma with sweet blackberry/blueberry character behind a spicy yeast character.  Clove and allspice mixed with juicy fruit gum and a heavy wheaty spiciness.  Full sweet palate, with raisins and plummy malts all contributing to the brews flavour.  As the temperature comes up, a great fresh minty hop aroma/flavour comes up helping to soften all the sweet fruits and spices.  This is a very fruity, but well-balanced and very tasty brew.  One of the best Ive had from this up and coming brewery.  I cant wait to try what else they have coming down the line.


750 ml bottle batch 2.  Deep orange-tinted brown with a thick light tan head.  Sweet plummy aroma, rye toast, wheaty spice and a lots of cherry and dried fruits.  Orange peel, clove and lighter berryish notes.  Flavour is sweet but shows lots of malty complexity.  A soft earthy component as well.  Some Belgian caramel, toffee, and sweet cherry/berry, plum fruitiness.  Spicy finish with a touch more bitterness than I might normally expect in this style.  Great balance of sweet malts and spicy yeastiness.  Very bready on the back with a light hit of black pepper.

577,"2007-02-16",3.8,"Courtesy of Boboski. The aroma is lightly toasted grains, tart fruits, candy sugar and crystalized sugars. Sounds cloying, but it smells pretty damn awesome. The body is a very ruddy brown with a tan head that is initially two fingers thick, but that fades quickly. Toasty and sweet malts in the fore proceed lightly sweet fruit notes, candy sugar and lightly citrus accented flavors, but there is a fuzzy muddled quality to the flavor that makes it less appealing than beers with clearly delineated flavor regions. Still its a pretty nice beer overall.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"
577,"2007-02-07",3.6,"Pretty vibrant red highlights(for a dubbel) surround murky browns, an enticing body. At once creamy and frothy, the khaki head is well sustained. As soon as I pour and sit the glass down for observation, alcohol seems to be wafting itself towards me, thats intense. Big caramel and candi sugar follow in the aroma, with touches of vanilla. Fruity notes abound: mainly nectarine and pineapple. Really smells like a des Rocs offering, well done! Flavor is less exciting. Alcohol and candi sugars pervade. Lesser fruity flavors are masked by musty asnd dry caramel malts. The palate is creamy and sweet. Finishes very full and somewhat cloying. The parts of this beer were more interesting than the sum, especially the authentic feeling nose and the thicker than average lacing. Unfortunately I had the feeling this beer was bringing with its enjoyment a slight headache the following morning.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

A medium bown color with a quickly dissolving head. Almost a burnt malt smell. Had to repour to get more head into the beer to pickup much smell. Malty taste, and also a hint of alcohol. Maybe a faint taste of cocoa. Lingers in the mouth nicely. Seems to be a little light on the carbonation. Very smooth feel.

How: Back from Europe tasting session with Montreal crew (re-rate from 3.6 to 3.9)
The look:  Cloudy bronze body with a medium off-white head 
In long: Aroma is pineapples, cherries and a bunch of other tropical fruits.  Taste is honeyed nuts meeting orange and citric fruitiness.  A little tart/astringent.  Very lively carbonation.  A Pleasantville pleasant beer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
577,"2006-11-27",3.4,"Dark caramel brown, the head was an off grey hue that could have had more spunk.

Rich boozy effluves that gives away fruity aromas like cherries and prunes, all in a warm caramel coating. 

Carbonation felt a little too lively, but it actually worked out well as it mingled with the alcohol that tingled my face all the way to my nose, like drinking sparkling wine too fast.  Solid malt presence, but had a touch of ash in the end that spoils the sweetness in the end.  Still, a good Beer in a style where Im sort of hard to please.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
577,"2006-11-27",3.6,"Any first impressions?
-Suave foam dissipates quickly into the glowing garnet orange.
-Blackberries and active yeast seduce the nostrils in a rather fruity aroma.
-A plethora of berries are leaking onto a bed of cocoa.
-The rich maltiness and comfortable carbonation create a luxurious mouthfeel.

What if you dig deeper?
-The powdery yeast somewhat mars the aromas definition.
-Chestnuts are found in the fruit cake.
-This very competent, fruity dubbel is a bottle-conditioned success. Looking forward to trying their other bottled wares, as I was slightly disappointed by a couple tap and cask pints.

Bottled in 2006.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

Appears a dark, transparent mahogany with red hues. The small, light tan cap slowly fades out into a floating foam top. Scattered lacing is left all around the glass.
Smell is of raisins, caramel, brown sugar, light spices highlited by black pepper.
Taste is of the aromas with creamy, sugary, raisins, vanilla, and cocoa powder. Pretty nice.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, yeasty, with cocoa clinging to the semi-dry palate. As one of my favorite styles, this one hit the spot.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"

Well-aged hops balance things out. Full-bodied with a lightly creamy mouthfeel and modest carbonation. Finishes rich and then fairly dry.

577,"2006-10-24",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2007 2007 batch 2: The carbonation issues from the first batch have been fixed and this beer now has a fantastic body. Though the aroma is still a bit lacking (there just isnt much there), there is a deep and rewarding complexity in the flavor and a lovely chocolate finish. Very good stuff.  

2006 batch 1: Im not sure, I think my bottle could be infected, but this is still a very interesting beer. Most others mention at least some kind of fluffy head, but mine has almost none. As in, a vigorous pour yields about 1 mm. The body is also quite thin. But it is made up by an incredibly complex, intriguing flavor, more like a distilled liquor than any beer Ive had. There is lots of tobacco, cocoa, port, brown sugar. Other flavors noted include a little grain alcohol, orange, lemon, grass, coriander, oak, rum. Aroma is a significantly weaker version of the same. I dont think this is how this is supposed to be, but it is pretty great none-the-less. If the body and aroma werent so thin, this would easily be in the 4s. Ill have to try this again and see if the experience is different. 6/3/10/3/17","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

577,"2006-07-21",3.9,"2006 750mL bottle shared by Mkobes or EDA (I think) at BCTC 06.Chestnut with some light crimson and maroon tinges on the edges and sediment in the bottle, but decanting with medium to medium low clarity.  The head is medium-dark beige, small, but well-formed and stable, providing spotty lacing at points.Soft clove is painted atop sliced banana bread and then swiftly dunked in cola.  But its not as disjointed or overt as that sounds, and plenty of caramel and sweetened hazelnut-paste-like malt notes intermingle, soothing the nostrils.  Yeast esters enter the mix on the finish, stretching the aroma and adding lively dark fruits to the mix.  A dry hazelnut roastiness pervades, perhaps a touch too strongly, all the while and warming produces sweet cinnamon-cookie dough notes that really push the boundaries of how sweet you want your dubbel, but in the end, I dont expect a massively sweet/underattenuated beer based on the nose.  Furthermore, no alcohol is apparent.And upon first sip, Im pleasantly surprised to find it even less sweet than expected.  Soft, but supportive is the body, with light caramel and raisin sweetness sticking to the sides of the palate initially.  As the light phenols slowly creep in, a dry breadiness works hand-in-hand to balance the beer, while plum and dark berry esters keep things lively.  Very well extracted is the malt, leading to a wonderful mouthfeel and the carbonation is so fine and engaging that I could hardly ask for more from it.  Its certainly a rock solid rendition and one that any Belgian brewery could be proud of.  Alcohol is not a factor.  The zesty, lively fruits and dry phenols seem to only go as far as to balance, without adding astringency problems.  Nor does heavy clove build up at any point.  Hops stay out of the way as they should for a dubbel and are true to style.  A touch more attenuation and more musty/funky yeast nuances and this would be near perfect.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

577,"2006-07-02",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2006 [re-rate - there is a lot more complexity than I remember - chocolate and carmel thick in the aroma - flavor of overripe apples and pears covered in caramel - lightly acidic finish, with some more fruity esters - still not the best of dubbels, but quite nice] Hazy amber pour, with somewhat frothy lace - aroma of toffee, raisins, black cherries - spicy and peppery up front, followed by some earthy, nearly tart qualities, quickly cut off by a sugary, caramel sweetness, dark fruit and slight bready malt - a little thin in the finish, with a distinct, alcohol burn which becomes a little unpleasant - not bad for such a young brewery, though.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

577,"2006-05-26",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2010 Cask @ the Hop Devil Grill.  Poured into a pint glass with about a 3/4 inch head.  The color is a translucent brown color, can only make out shapes through it. Aroma is very unique for a Dubbel.  A strong orange-like aroma.  Similar orange presence in the flavor, leaves a Clementine sweetness-like aftertaste.  I feel this beer is too young.  The cask may not be the best way to taste it. I would love to try a bottled version that has sat a bit.  7/3/7/3/14.Rerate 7/25/06.  Got my chance with a 750 ml bottle.  Poured into large wine glass.  Small head and a deep brown and cannot see through the beer.  Aroma is present.  I get a lot of pine, not hoppy pine but actual pine tree mixed with a Belgian sweetness.  Taste is a lighter dubbel, low sweetness.  Medium body.  A good stab and very different from the cask version.  7/3/8/3/15. Rerate: 7/11/07.  750ml bottle (batch 2).  Again this is just so underwhelming, too young, too estery, lots of sour tangerine, thin, watery.  Oh man, this batch is very similar to the cask version I first tasted in May 2006.  6/3/6/3/13  Re:rate on 5/24/10, almost exactly 4 years after my first taste of this beer. This is a rating for batch 2 750mL bottle that is now 3 years old and wow this has improved.  This beer was by far my least favorite bottled beer from CL.  However, age has done a wonderful thing.  All the weird esters have gone away.  This beer is full of plumy, dark, actual dubbel-like characteristics.  Plumy-dark-bread with a wonderful full mouthfeel with a slightly subdued carbonation.  This was a joy to drink.  No sign of oxidation at all.  8/3/8/4/17.  Overall rating is a composite of the different versions.  Side note: I had batch with 3 years on it as well last summer at BCTC and that was amazing as well. Bottom Line: Concerning batch 1 & 2, very young and green when fresh, beautiful with 3 years on it.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
