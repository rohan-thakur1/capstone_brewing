3180,"2015-02-14",3.1,"180 ml bottle with free plastic ochoko as Gekkeikan Cap Ace Saké bought at ParkNShops promotion booth at Spot in Sheung Shui during Pre-Lunar New Year promotion.
Clear and colourless; Quite fragrant aroma of glutinous rice wine, with pear puree, floral nectar, sugar, ester, strong alcohol and thick sweet rice soup; Mid to light sweet taste of rice wine, with mid to strong tartness, strong pear flesh, floral, light sugar, strong warming alcohol and light liquorices; Light body, watery palate; Mouth feel is watery at first, but the mashed pear flesh and strong booze hit you very quickly and surprisingly, quite comfortably. Strong flowery backgroung throughout, the pear ester is perhaps one of the strongest and very fleshy Ive had among sakes, and the 15.5% rice booze neither sharp nor offensive. Quite easy and comfy for the style. Moderate liquorices-like bitterness give it a good jump for the finish. Good!...Wet after taste; Quite easy, sweet and bitter to mouth.

Comments: Thought this one is just another cheapo Futsu-shu, it turns out to be easily drinkable, with exciting peary esters, quite tasty booze, just-right sweetness and good bitterness. A decent surprise.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

3180,"2013-10-28",3.4,"Hope that I am rating the correct sake here since text on the label of my glass cup is in Japanese only. 100 ml. procured from Sun Wah in Antwerp. Packaging is pretty much the strangest I have seen so far for any alcoholic beverage. Clear glass cup that looks like the glassware in which some yoghurts are sold, aluminium lid with a plastic hand grenade / soft drink pin allowing you to pull off the lid. Cover mentions 08.2012 but no idea whether that is bottling date or BBF. Chilled only slightly. Drank straight from the glass cup which is the intend I assume. Clear slightly very, very faintly yellowish (might be the background) vodka-like liquid. Nose is mildly floral, sake yeast, sweetish herbs, decent floral sake yeast note, faint alcohol. Taste is sweetish, simple, floral yeast, soft white rice, strong sake yeast, slightly sugary, lots of floral notes, faint wild herbs, touch lemon grass, hint watery, finish is boozy but not overly heavy. Warming. Slightly oily, touch watery. I would say that this is indeed lower tier as far as sake goes & pretty simple but it was pretty enjoyable still. Not too bad.

3180,"2013-07-08",3.1,"180mL glass bottle with plastic cup as a hat, as Sake Gekkeikan Cap-Ace, a common table sake, though not necessarily a good one. Screw cap. Alcoholic nose, some mild fruit, some rice, floral. Crystal clear with no head. Lightly sweet taste but lasting, mildly floral, burns a bit on the way down but only in the throat and the alcohol isnt utterly raw; the watery-light body actually somewhat smooth, not utterly flat. Fruit is actually a really pleasant melon. I dont have much experience with sake, so the frame of reference is absolutely pure hedonism, and theres a good deal of success there. On the whole, goes down really easily, and Id absolutely buy it again at this price ($3.99 iirc).","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

I smell a musty blend of chardonnay, vinegar, and alcohol... uh oh, getting aprehensive about this first sip.  After taking a couple small sips, I am intrigued by the softness, yet still dry impact to my senses.  Not much of a flavor at all, but the taste is more what one would expect after having half a dozen ice cubes melt in it first - watery.

My old Suburban and I
Make our way to a Whole Foods 
When a sake caught my eye!

A rating of the sake,
By itself, as a single rate
Is not significant in point,
But I dare not tempt wrath of fate.

This will be my second sake.
This can only broaden my palate
A fairly new venture for me,
 Cause, fuck you, I have a palate.

The bottle is small and cute,
A plastic lid covers the twist cap.
Im not sure as to why.
It closes both ways, like a snap.

Poured into Jester King Snifter
I can make out nothing but water.
There is no head to speak of.
Perhaps I should drink this hotter?

With a stink in my eye and nose,
I inhale more deeply.
Greeted by fruit and pine needles,
Then the alcohol comes swiftly.

The taste is not so pleasant.
It is hot without much more.
Maybe some rice flavors here,
But theres alcohol galore.

The finish lingers a while
Like a bad dream of sorts.
The whole, long experience
I liken to wearing jorts.

Another tick for me.
A tickers life can expect
So many many drinks to be had
Some are not so abject.

That this was not so rough,

3180,"2006-01-29",1.1,"This is my first (and possibly last) sake, so take my rating with a grain of salt.  I served this warm in the little gimmicky cup.  Appearance was just a clear liquid, but I cant find fault because thats what it is SUPPOSED to look like.  Aroma was weak and vaguely of rice water. Flavor was the same, with the addition of alcohol burn.  Im not a fan.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","Quixote18"

Clear as water (or vadka)... how do you rate an appearance of filtered saki? Smells of soy sauce, rice, and uncooked oatmeal flakes. Flavor is pretty much the same, actually. A decent amount of rice, soy sauce, and oatmeal flakes are present, with the rice and soy standing out. Not a strong flavor at all. Not overly enjoyable, but its drinkable.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","hershiser2"
3180,"2005-11-22",2.6,"Whole Foods, Baton Rouge, La. squat little 6.1 oz bottle - served cold. Clear pour with a slight sheen. Clean, boiled rice aroma - slight fruitness. Very plain and straightforward sake flavor. A bit of rice, overipe fruit. Clean mouthful. Alcohol noticeable. Overall, not bad, bt think Ive reached the bottom of the barrell for Sake here.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"

3180,"2005-09-27",1.7,"This was the first sake I ever tried, and it almost turned me off to tasting any others.  We met our friends for a sushi dinner and Jeff said we should order some sake.  We had this both hot and cold.  Either way, it smelled pretty bad - alcohol burn in the nose, especially when warmed.  (In hindsight, I think the warmed was served too hot)  The flavors were sweet, harsh and slightly metallic.  I have no need to revisit this one when there are so many other sakes to taste.  Turning the top into a little cup reminds me of serving a 40ozer in a paper bag!","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"

Second rating: this time I decided to try it warmed and I have to say that it was better this way. More robust alcohol in the aroma and taste as well as a somewhat unexpected pickle taste. Not great but a little more complex. Was all right with sweet and sour chicken and noodles.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"

3180,"2005-01-10",1.7,"Bottle, warmed in pan of hot water. Dang! A stab at a second sake, and its the same style as my first. Will this amusement never end? Okay. This one is somewhat banana-ey on first sniff. Tasting leaves some harsh alcohol in the sides of my mouth. Doesnt leave as much play as the Hakusan I had earlier. However, I do get an interesting peppermint impression on the tip of my tongue. But thats about it.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

This little bottle is sweet! I like it because Ive wanted to rate a sake here to prove that I was complex and diverse but didnt want to spend $15 on a bottle of something that probably will taste like crap (Ive tried a couple sakes before they were rated and found the very best or at least the most expensive to be only tolerable). But this bad boy rolled up on my block and now I get to rate a tiny little gimmick of a bottle for only three bones. In your face, RateBeer!

Whats super-awesome is that it comes with its own sake cup. Proper glassware included, beat that! Well, its plastic but still and pleases me to no small extent.
Dont worry. Im gonna rate this thing. Down the hatch!  
The crazy thing about this is it looks clear in the bottle but when you pour it in the little white cup it has a slight yellow tint like urine when youre starting to attack that second 15-pack of Blatz. Holy crap this smells bad! I mean legitimately awful. Like possibly this is a small plastic glass of dilute kerosene. Theres some kind of something else too but I dont know what the hell it is. Its sorta grassy. Whatever it is, closer inspection is making me wince.
Dare me to taste it!?
""Do it, dude! I bet yer chicken.""
Im no chicken! Im goin in!
Hey! Thats not nearly as bad as I expected. Its got an interesting oily texture along with a weird evaporative property. The taste is like the aroma only more pronounced and less like kerosene, which is good. I hate the way kerosene tastes. Its kind of fruity but mild with an edge of some bizarre type of nut that doesnt exist in this hemisphere. The alcohol isnt all that bad but its still there. Man, who knows whats wrong with this world anymore?
Remember when everyone got all in a tizzy over how sake was being added to the site? Those conversations were boring as hell! All the anti-sake crowd would have needed to do was give some of this to the Most Reverend Josh Oakes and explained to him that having sake on the site would mean more people would try this tat. He never would of allowed it then with full knowledge of what he was unleashing on innocent people who want a sake rating on the cheap.
The upside is I have more sake than I could drink in a year and it only cost three bucks. How long will this keep in the fridge?","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

3180,"2004-10-06",2.1,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2004 180ml bottle with the plastic sake cup on top. This was a nice warming brew with a light heat to it, faint red apple fruitiness to the taste and aroma, with a  sweet start and mild burn toward the end. I enjoyed the Hakutsuru more with a big lighter of alcohol dominance in the flavor.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
3180,"2004-08-31",2.9,"(Bottle w/ plastic Ochoko cup)  Sampled cold.  Pours a nearly clear transparent color.  Aroma of vanilla and rubbing alcohol.

3180,"2004-07-01",2.8,"Colorless and crystal clear. White grapes, clean vaporous alcohol, starch, and waxed gum notes in the aroma. Soft, silky mouthfeel. Starts with cotton notes before the alcohol engulfs the palate and erases the subtle flavors. Faintly starchy, which makes the body seem chewy. Soft, abbreviated, powdery, unclean finish.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3180,"2004-05-14",3.0,"My first Sake, and as a beer drinker I was a bit apprehensive as to how Id like it.  Tiny 6 oz. bottle with a small plastic cup shaped like an Ochoko (which Id never had known without the pictures on this site).  The aroma is flowery with a noticeable alcohol presence, as can be expected for a drink with 15% to 16% ABV.  The appearance is clear with a slight yellowish tinge to it.  There is no carbonation at all.  Nice sweet boiled rice taste, with a very warming alcohol presence, and a hint of spiciness in the back of the throat.  Buttery smooth mouthfeel is enhanced by serving it a bit above body temperature that I warmed it to.  This is nice as a change of pace, and much better than most wines Ive ever had, but I miss my hops.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
3180,"2004-01-01",3.1,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2004 New Year's Eve 2003: I was pleasantly surprised by this tasty Gekkeikan product.  I'm finding more and more that sakes made in Japan are far, far more smooth and buttery than those brewed Stateside.  This is yet another example of this phenomenon, as this inexpensive Cap Ace is quite drinkable.  The harshness of the alcohol in most American-brewed sakes isn't present here, and that's probably due to the special Japanese rice strains used in Japan.  Granted, this Cap Ace isn't dry or particularly complex, but with its mild sweetness and terrific mouthfeel, it goes down quite well.  Also, you gotta love the little white sake cup that doubles as a bottle cap!","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
3180,"2003-12-19",3.1,"Served warm.  Slightly medicinal aroma.  Watery appearance, with a slightly green hue.  Watery, oily body with a long stinging flavor.  It lacks a depth of flavor compared to the other sake I tried that night.  Quick finish.  Where is the complexity?  The ""Budweiser of Sake"" I've been told.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
