3601,"2013-07-03",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2016 My Bottom Line:
This super smooth, quintessential Bitter marries leafy, orangey hops to honeyed, lightly caramelized malts for an impeccable pint.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sticky head of foam covers the clear amber, lacing beautifully.
-Drinkability is very high.
-The nose could be better developed, in my tastes anyway.
-The leafy hop bitterness is long lasting.
-A subtle peppery spiciness gives the flavour profile more depth.
-A mineral touch is found in the nose (not nearly as intense as the one I had gotten in the bottled version).

3601,"2005-08-30",3.1,"The mystery that is Landlord.  A highly acclaimed beer that mostly doesnt quite live up to expectation. A beer that is widely available due to its huge (indeed, legendary) reputation, but is almost as equally widely acknowledged to be often served in poor condition. The malt base is quite laid back, almost lacking in character, but providing a sufficiently fruity base for the hops to do their thing. And it is the hops for which the beer is most famous. When on form the hops have a dusty English intensity which combined with the fruity malt can deliver a wonderful fresh citric grapefruit edge. At this point the beer is refreshing and invigorating, delivering an impact that approaches the modern American Pale Ales, but retaining the fascinating English dustiness and sulphur notes which are best discovered in a fresh cask ale. But, while this pale hoppy Best Bitter does hold a certain fascination when in top condition, it never quite delivers a world-class punch.  So... Landlord mostly lacks character - the malt is just bland, and the hops simply bitter, and even when on form, though tasty and hoppy, doesnt sufficiently entice or shine with splendour.","ENGLAND","Scarborough"

Almost clear, brownish-orange with a creamy and bubbly head that appears to climb the sides of the glass.
