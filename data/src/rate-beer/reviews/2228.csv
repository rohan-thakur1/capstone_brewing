This is a reasonable oktoberfest. However compared to the real thing it is nothing special. With all the other choices on the shelf right now from Hoppin Frog I would suggest picking up their higher gravity releases and IPAs first. If you still have the motivation then tick this off.

Aroma / Appearance - The transparent coppery body has a nice soft head that falls down like lazy snowflakes until it barely covers the base. Lively carbonation sparkles with life. Melted Milky Ways left in a hot car, sweet glazed donuts, and frosting from a package of grocery store cupcakes provide an edge that is a bit too saccharine for my preferences.

Flavor / Palate - The creamy mouthfeel is refreshing for a few sips. During that time a wave of bittersweet chocolate, caramel, and noble hops trade off before a quick finish. This isnt overly complex for a 7% ABV beer and in fact feels a trace thin. Overall though it isnt bad and I have definitely had far worse.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
