1720,"2016-10-14",3.8,"Quand je pense à une Hefe, cest à une Hefe de ce genre que je pense. Le liquide nest pas trop pâle et affiche une tenue franche ainsi quun corps droit. Belle mousse collante au verre et fines bulles en suspension. Très jolie! Au nez par contre, le bonbon à la banane est trop puissant pour pleinement plaire à mes narines. Un fond céréalier sert dassise solide mais la banane est tout simplement un rien trop puissante. Levures européennes gardant lensemble équilibré malgré ce goût presque sûr de banane. Délicate amertume en fin de bouche alimentée par des bulles légères et frivoles. Très bonne weizen.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

Une acidité propre au blé, une texture croquante et corpulente où simmiscent du poivre et dautre épices variées. Ça se boit tout seul. Cest agréable, cest bien fait et sans reproches.

1720,"2012-11-25",3.7,"Had this on tap at National for DDC! tap takeover. Pours a hazy bright yellow with a thick sticky foamy white head. The nose is pure hefe with big clove spices, wheaty and caramel malts, light banana fruitnotes too. The flavour is a bit sweet and bready with cloves and a bit of coriander coming through. Bananas, apples, no bubblegum though. Beautiful light citrus yeast esters and a crisp German yeast flavour. Overall, a fantastic Hefe up there with a great German Hefeweizen.

This is a brass opalescent blond coloured beer. It is topped by a thick compact foam which sticks to the glass and is sustained by a strong effervescence. Its fragrance is one of cloves with a hint of bananas, all of which is wrapped in an aroma of warm baked bread. Its a light tasting and fruity beer with only a mild flavour of hops. It is a very smooth tasting beer with a touch of acidity.","Alberta, CANADA","patricks110"

Des saveurs qui se collent au genre avec une présence houblonnée indéniable.  Une bouche légère et sans tracas.  Une finale dépices qui se frottent à une amertume de houblons.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

Rien naccroche. En bouche le liquide est tout aussi classique, avec du clou de girofle, des bananes et autres épices.

1720,"2011-07-02",3.8,"On tap at trou du diable. Light golden color, very slight haze, far from the traditional ""white"" appearance that I am used to for a hefeweizen. Aroma of crisp wheat, fresh bread notes, some yeastiness (light banana) with distinct new world hops. Flavor is light, kind of sweet, a touch of yeast and hops add spice to it all. Palate is light and fluffy. Very nice ""north-americanization"" of a classic style.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

1720,"2007-02-19",3.8,"[Pint @ the brewpub] Nice wheat aroma-- kind of sweet with some spices  in there. Pours a very hazy golden color that almost seems to glow in the light. A very full-flavored hefeweizen, sweet wheat, banana and clove backed up by a strong yeast presence. Not quite as ""refreshing"" as the usual German Hefe, this is a bit richer in body and flavor. Extremely drinkable. This is yet another outstanding beer from DDC.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","BitchesBrew"

1720,"2006-11-21",3.4,"Cloudy yellow-blonde body with a large but quickly diminishing white head.  The main hefe elements are here (banana aroma, wheaty body) but the intensity is off the chart.  This is not a light refreshing hefe.  Creamy banana paste with a full haystack packed in a pint.  To go along with the not-refreshing theme, the fruitiness (banana and some peach) does not include lemon.  This is one thick and filling hefe.  They could sell as a hefe concentrate packaged in small frozen cans with the instruction add two full cans of water to obtain refreshing hefeweizen.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1720,"2004-11-29",3.5,"Shining gold pour with a light veil. Head is white, 1-inch tall, frothy. Stronger than average aroma. If they did can bananas, I assume it would smell a bit like this. It comes out slightly lactic with cinnamon and cloves afterthoughts. Sweet banana/mango palate with an honest bitter kick. Plenty of mouthfeel, an effervescent lemon pie. Pretty good for the style I found.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1720,"2004-11-24",3.0,"Hazy golden body topped with a large frothy head. Decent malty aroma with some spicy hints. Taste is well-balanced but lacks some complexity.

Bright, opaque luminous gold with a large but fast-decaying head...super-banana-rum-cream concoction of a nose, perhaps too sweet with little spice but splendid anyway.  Bananas & cream on the tongue, just a bit of citric tartness late.  Fairly simple and quite sweet, but very pleasant and eminently drinkable.  Mmmm.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
