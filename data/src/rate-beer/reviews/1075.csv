1075,"2006-03-29",3.3,"An amber yellow coloured, still perry. Despite its name the nose is sweet and slightly vinegary, like that of a dessert wine! The taste is again sweet and grapey.

1075,"2005-10-07",3.7,"From the barrel at GBBF, August 2005 (Day 2). Pale hazy colour, with that typical perry pastel hue. A really nice perry.  Norfolk ciders and perries are often a bit wimpish compared to those from points West. Not so here.  Strong, farmyard aroma, with hints of sulphur. Packed with pear fruit. Sweetish, but theres a lot of tannin to provide a solid backbone and some acidity to give it some bite. Excellent stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
1075,"2005-09-11",3.2,"Strong apple/pear aroma.  Hazy yellow-white body is still with no head.  Strong pear flavour with some apple and sulfur tones.  Light alcohol.  Some woodiness.  Quite dry, light, refreshing and wine-like.  Barrel at GBBF 2005.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
