4448,"2017-06-14",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2017 375 ml bottle, bb 23/11/2025, shared by Werckmeister, thanks!
Deep red body, with a small, creamy, off-white head. 
Aroma of funk, cheese, sour fruits, the berries not that obvious, unripe pears, apples, horse blanket. 
Tastes quite similar, while the blackberries are coming more through. 
Medium, slick mouthfeel, with an average carbonation. 
Finishes sour, medium dry, very fruity, with sour berries, pears, apples, some funk. 

Tasty. The funk notes are dominating, but the sour berries are also coming through, especially in the taste. My favourite Tilquin so far, really diverse and not as puckeringly acidic as the other ones Ive had.

4448,"2017-04-17",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Citrusy acidity and the usual Lambic funk dominate the blackberries in this pleasant creation.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam floats atop the cloudy purplish red.
-The blackberries could be brighter.
-Acidity levels are relatively high, but the beer remains quite drinkable.
-This one is strangely more lambic-y than fruity.

Im going to continue to damn this with faint praise to some extent, and say its very, very good - but hell if I can discern a significant difference between this and the other variants Ive had, or if I can detect any mûre (blackberry). I want to say its about as good as the original (Oude Quetsche Tilquin à lAncienne) Ive had a couple of times now, and slightly better than the avec Prunes de Namur I had last year. Unlike the situation with the avec Prunes de Namur, I dont find that this one is less bright and tart than the Oude Quetsche Tilquin à lAncienne, but rather find it to be an intensely tart yet very well-balanced Lambic, with a lovely dry finish that invites the next sip.

4448,"2016-09-16",3.9,"375mL bottled November 2015, drunk 9/9/16.Good clarity, leaving sediment behind, in this soft, maroon-tinted peach-auburn beer. Rosy-tinted head is medium-sized and shows moderate to moderately-low retention.Strong blackberry character is dry, well-attenuated, lightly juicy and quite boisterously acidic. As with the two Quetsche versions, its immediately similar in that the lambic is a bit masked/dominated by the strong fruit element. Not to the point of it being problematic, but I would like more lambic character than what you get. I guess thats what you get from a young fruit lambic and an older bottle of Quetsche did prove to be significantly better than younger samples. Still, it doesnt seem to have a ton of personality and has quite an austere sourness to it, with light horseblanket and tons of bright acidity.Similar in the flavor, with tart/acidic fruits and a very dry, attenuated body. Strong lactic/acetic component, with minor lime-like brett notes and a hard cheese rind-like character on the finish. Tight carbonation and a fairly soft, malty texture. Obviously a well-made beer and brewed for extended aging. Probably better to rate them with 3-5 years age on them, honestly, though I wish there was a little more sublime funk to them when young.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Pours a clear, crimson to ruby red color, with a small, fizzy head, collapsing to a sheet of white lacing, coating the edge of the glass. 

Has a completely fruit defined nose, featuring wild berries, with a present blackberry appearance on top. These obtain a mellowing earthy note, leading to a fruit stone pit quality, with ripe, luscious fruit pulp being the most defining characteristic. This natural fruit sweetness blends very well into an overripe berry impression, revealing tart, fermented fruit among an oaken softness. Wet hay, leather and blue cheese, smooth out the fruit / sour interplay, creating a well nuanced yet genuine nose.

Drinks very soft, with almost no carbonation to detect at all, while a noteable aqueous silkness levels the beers sourness well.

Prickly, unripe blackberries are recognizable from the very beginning, revealing just the smallest amount of sweetness, which you typically get from the berries outer skin, together with a whiff of elder bush and an organic, young wood impression, from smelling a wet twig. The beer turns even more sour then, with a pungent, dry tartness, covering lemon peel and a whiff of vinegar, almost completely getting soaked up by prominent wood bark, while teaming up with black pepper hull and dusty sponge. Finishes with a mineralic quality, and utmost dry, crisp lemon together with foliage leaves, coating up truly unripe blackberries, which are still detectable, but limited to add more profile to the very present lime, rather than produce a mentionable depth of flavors on their own.

I really appreciate the natural depth of blackberry in this, featuring its pulp, skin and stone pits facets, together with a zingy, long lasting tartness, which the actual berries leave behind on the upper jaw. The fruit qualities in general arent totally over the top though, but create a nice interplay with the lambics tartness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Clear purple ruby red with a short dissipating head.

Tart acidic aroma with lemons, tart dark berries, wood and funk. 

Dry tart taste with lemons and blackberries and woody funk. 

Medium to light bodied with soft carbonation and a dry texture.

Refreshingly firm and dry with the blackberries giving some extra shine in the aftertaste. Maybe a bit streamlined and thin, but I only had a small glass from a 375ml bottle and I think the whole bottle with sediment and all would have given it some extra weight.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","Mad_Ferret"

4448,"2015-06-18",4.1,"Bottle (375 ml). Shared by Whatup14, thanks David! Split 2-ways.

Appearance: Cloudy ruby-ish pink with a small quickly vanishing off-white head, pinkish hues and little to no lacing. 

Aroma: Bright blackerries along nice funk, Tilquin usual lemony signature, earthy notes, barnyard, black raspberries and mild leafy presence.

Taste: Blackberries forward with nice funk and acidic features (without being too much), earthy notes, lemon, red berries, barnyard, leafy notes and mineral presence.

Palate: Medium body. Soft carbonation. Rather dry finish. Fruity aftertaste. A bit lemony as well. 

Overall: Another homerun from Tilquin. A bit more carbonation would help both the appearance and the palate but otherwise its a bright fruit lambic with a really nice balance. Super tasty stuff. Loved it.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

4448,"2015-06-06",4.2,"Bottle from De Hopduvel. An utter rarity: this is a brambleberry lambic, apparently produced very limitedly. Loose and milky, very pale greyish head breaking in instants but retaining around the edges, colour is a beautiful, hazy magenta red, a tad darker and clearly more purplish than your average oude kriek. Interesting and somewhat weird aroma: less spritzy than I had expected, sour-sweet brambleberries indeed, amidst impressions of brambleberry yoghurt, red lambrusco, lime juice, fresh redcurrant, buttermilk, wet hay, roses and all the animalistic odours of fertilized farmland, barnyard, horse steak and horseblanket (not that I ever sniffed one, but you get my drift). In warming up, a deep, sweet cooked fruit aroma comes more forward, almost port- and jam-like and very agreeable.  Extremely fruity onset, the sourish sweetness of brambleberries is clearly there again if you know what they taste like, but a wild array of esters add a huge amount of complexity, as in any good fruit lambic; unripe plums, strawberries, fresh apple and a refined but feisty lemony acidity running through the whole. Carbonation is refinedly fizzy, as in a crémant. Soft basic wheat sourishness is there but some gentle, bready malts show up too, buried under the truckload of fruit and mellow, bacterial lactic acidity (sour yoghurt), with the lemony tartness drying the finish, very appetizing or in fact mouth watering; woody notes add further drought and a deep echo of earthy hops lends the whole a kind of sedate, late bitterness. Very juicy, sharpish, refined, brut and complexely fruity flavour - this is how any traditionally made fruit lambic should be. I like this a lot, it is a welcome distraction from the usual sour cherries but brambleberries apparently work equally well in a lambic. Hopefully this will stay in production. Classy!","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Bit hazy deep red to purple beer, no head. aroma: very dirty, sulphur, ""putje"", sewer. Am I the only one picking this up? I found it really harsh and offensive. MF: no carbon, medium body. Taste: very sour, tannins, bitter, lemony, bit weird, soft fruity touch. Aftertaste: bitter, tannins, some chlorine. I hope Pierre doesnt hate me for this, but I found the N&R Shot in the Dark much better. More fruity, if I compare tasting notes.","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"

Taste is quite sour with lots of lemon, quite acidic older lambiek, tart yoghurt, fruit is in the back, feels like unripe sour fruit, Little carbonation. Solid body with little in the way of carbonation. This might improve with age & very likely it will become more complex.

4448,"2015-05-03",4.2,"Sample @1st Tilquin English Beer Festival +Open Doors  Rien quau nez, je retrouve la signature Tilquin: un équilibre bien maitrisé entre amertume et acidité. En bouche, je goûte dabord cette acidité, fine et bienveillante qui arrive sur la pointe de la langue et qui se prolonge par le houblonnage tout à la fois discret mais persistant. Le maltage fromenté est doux légèrement biscuité. Là où la Quetche pèche un peu sur les saveurs fruitées, la Mûres tient toutes ses promesses mais plutôt en arrière bouche avec une belle intensité quon lui connait. Ses saveurs fruitées accompagnent le houblonnage en laissant une belle longueur en bouche.","Braine, BELGIUM","poech73"

4448,"2015-04-30",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2015 Couleur est foncée avec une palette versant sur le pourpre, cette dernière présentant un léger voile. Le col est généreux sans offrir une trop grande rétention, ce dernier offre un ton beige. 

Arôme se présente de manière évolutive depuis les premières dégustation, pour arriver à une étape plus optimale et qui fait bien ressortir le bouquet de la mûre sans verser dans un scénario maintes fois répéter par d?autres; càd dans le surfait, non-naturel. Je retrouve un fruité très intéressant et complexe mais avec un clair bouquet de gueuze qui laisse une balance entre les lambics et la mûre. 

Palais est agréablement fruité avec pour moi un profile fruité qui vient plus titiller la fin de bouche et ce profile somptueux de mûre tout en alternant un côté sec/poussiéreux moyennement aigre-acidulé de la gueuze. Sur les versions précédentes, je notais un fruité noir nettement plus en retrait, mais dont le côté suret restait présent, quant à cette version de la mûre, c?est surtout sa saveur, qui ici reprend le dessus en apportant un ajout acidulé appréciable. Palais reste bien pétillant venant touché le haut du palais sur un côté moyennement épicé/fruité. J?arrête ici car je n?ai pas vraiment pour habitude d?écrire autant sur une bière. 

Au final, une bière qui me plaît, énormément de par sa complexité mais aussi de par son goût évolutif qui en qcq mois montre déjà de subtiles signes de changement. Mon c?ur balance un peu entre la mûre et la questche, sans être aux antipodes l?une de l?autre, elles offrent assez de caractère et de raffinement pour évoluer de manière intéressante en cave. Reste la sempiternelle question de savoir quand déguster cette mûre ; fraîche ou avec un peu de bouteille.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
