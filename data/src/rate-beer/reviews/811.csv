811,"2016-12-14",3.3,"Keg at the brewery, 9/2/16. Clear amber, thin fizzy off-white head, decent retention. Aroma of toasted malt and caramel. The taste matches. Medium bodied.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
811,"2016-06-28",2.9,"Draft. Hazed muddled dark gold pour. This one is strong with herbal notes and a thick maltiness. Not the best.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
811,"2015-05-21",3.4,"On tap at the brewpub, pours a hazy dark amber with a light tan head. The smell is honey, grain. The taste is fruit, honey, nice hop counter with crisp dryness. Medium body with nice carbonation.","Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, ENGLAND","ThirstyBird"
811,"2012-06-23",3.5,"Snifter at SC.  Unfiltered amber-brown.  Thin, patchy off-white/beige head.  Sort of an odd aroma, This is a unique twisted up beer.  Sugary sweet malt tones, odd sour buttery tones, and a decent balancing bitterness.  Solid alcohol richness.  Clovy, spicey, sticky.  Deep sweet malt tones, maybe a pinch underattenuated.  Thick malt tones.  Hardly World Class, but an interesting creation.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
811,"2011-05-01",3.7,"On tap at Silver Creek brewpub.  Cloudy apricot with a thin off-white head.  Aroma is pretty big with booze, fruit, tannins, and plenty of toffee and caramel.  Taste is in line with aroma with plenty of malt and fruit and some moderate warming and a touch of brunt malt on the back end.","Oak Creek, Wisconsin, USA","esjaygee"
811,"2009-12-20",3.3,"Great Taste 09. Ive had a few imperial maibocks now but havent been impressed by many. The sweet malt took over in this one for me and the body wasnt right. Not a bad brew, but I also dont like the style.","Appleton, Wisconsin, USA","IlanMan"
811,"2009-08-21",3.7,"Beer #25 at GTMW 09. Just looks fine in the glass. Nice lager smell, just a little heavy. Another great imperial lager taste. Just a good imperial bock. And the more beers I sample here, the shorter my review notes get.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
811,"2009-08-16",2.8,"Sampled @ GTMW 09 - Amber clear pour with a small white head. Smells of apple, but not much else -- a little sweet malt. Taste is lots of alcohol heat, more malt, and the same apple in the smell. The carbonation was jacked up to high, and there just wasnt much here. Not a fan.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
811,"2008-04-26",3.8,"Orange-brown color profile. First thing that hits you is  the strong peppery alcohol. Then comes caramel, malt, plums and toffee. It has been a while since Ive had this one but from memory this beer was very enjoyable if you arent knocked out by initial alcohol. Very unique offering, to say the least.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","bboeckl"
811,"2008-02-24",3.4,"Clear dark amber body with a tiny off-white head. The nose is sweet and vinous with herbs, plums and toffee. The flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter with golden raisins, herbs and slightly medicinal. Medium/full body is just slightly rough with moderate carbonation and a warm finish.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
811,"2007-11-18",3.6,"On tap at the brewpub on 6/21/07: Pours a transparent dark copper orange with a thin white head.  Intensely rich sweet caramely German malty nose has a light noble hoppy presence.  Starts with a touch of stinging carbonation before a viscous sweet caramel body and drier bittering hop balance before a warming peppery finish.  An interesting and fairly complex brew.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
811,"2007-10-21",3.6,"12oz handbottle, courtesy of Dickinsonbeer.  Thanks, Paul!  Pours a bright, orange-amber color; minimal head formation.  Dense, candy sugar and slightly sweet aroma; a bit one-dimensional.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: relaxed carbonation; boozy, chewy candy sugar; alcoholic mouthfeel: dried fruits and singular sugar presence; generous but a bit underwhelming.  Lengthy, chewy candy sugar finish.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
811,"2007-10-19",3.4,"Poured from a 12 oz handbottle.  Semi clear dark amber pour.  Rye, molasses, and alcohol on the nose; butterscotch, pistachio, hazelnut, and a hint of wild rice fill it out.  Similarly dry and earthy flavor with nuts, maple, and very light citrus hops.  Medium bodied palate with plenty of heat; a pasty, burning finish of rye whiskey mash.  A touch of salt and pleasant munich malt; alcohol weighs a bit too heavily.  More or less underwhelming.  Thanks for sharing, Paul!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
811,"2007-09-28",4.3,"Thanks to Dickinsonbeer for sharing part of his growler.  Pours a deep amber with a small head.  Aroma is very potent- with tons of caramel, raisins, toffee.   Taste is very smooth, with alot of caramel, toasted malts, raisins, brown sugar and caramelized munich-type malts.  Finishes fruity and smooth...the body is very full but this never becomes cloying.  The aroma and taste suggests of alcohol at times but it is so well hidden for its strength. This impy-maibock is just ridiculously good.  Thanks again Paul!!!","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
811,"2007-09-27",3.9,"Thanks to Skyview for sharing.  Light candy sugar nose.  Dark coppor color with faint head.  Caramel, alcohol, and malt on the body.  Very nice.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
811,"2007-09-26",3.7,"Thanks to Blake for bringing the hand-bottle!  Poured a clear, coppery-amber with a short cap of off-white head.. just a lovely color!  The aroma picked up a large, alcohol-fueled, deep bock-y presence, with the alcohol only as a supporting and warming influence.. sweet with deep caramel notes in there.. some herbal accents as well.. a little sharp as it approached room temp.  Sweet and sharper caramel and toffee in the flavor department.. very well-toasted.. sharper alcohol on the back of the palate led to a long warming finish.. tasty.  Heavier-bodied with lower carbonation (likely from the hand-bottle treatment).. a touch too strong and sharp at points, but very well done overall.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
811,"2007-09-24",4.4,"Grolwer thanks to Ofortuna.  Thanks David!  Pours a slightly hazy deep coppery amber with a thin lasting head- awesome carbonation despite being over a week in the growler- soft silky carbonation.  Aroma is initially a bit harsh when cold- lots of toasted malts, caramel, toffee, and even some burnt toast- light burning quality.  As it warms tons of toasted malts, light munich malts, sweet, caramel- almost like thos ebrachs caramel candies- fresh warm baked bread as well.  Flavor is silky sweet, smooth caramel, toasted malts, cookie dough, light molasses, some sweet brown sugar, and just tons of light toasted light munich and vienna malts.  Fuckin awesomely smooth mouthfeel.  This is like the best maibock- (reminds me of Ramstein) but on steriods.  When cold I actually got a hint of alcohol, but as it warms I didnt realy notice it that much- wierd.  Great beer.  Im glad I got a growler.  Thanks again David.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
811,"2007-09-24",3.6,"Simple but good.  The abv is a little too high as there is alcohol in the flavor and aroma.  Some caramel, and a sweet malt taste with alcohol.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
811,"2007-09-21",4.1,"Growler with many thanks to Skyview for hauling this back to us!  Dark copper color with a medium head.  Aroma of spices (cinnamon?) and honey.  Lots of alcohol in the flavor with plenty of dry malt and caramel.  Slight hops towards the finish.  Out-friggin-standing!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
811,"2007-09-17",3.8,"Growler.  Pours to a deep rusty red body with a tall and lasting foamy light beige head.  The aroma is malt, bock, and sweet strawberry hops.  The more I have of this, the more it reminds of a vanilla chai latte.  The flavor is toasted toffee malts, sweet strawberry seeds, nice bitterness, and nougat.  More vanilla chai shows up in the flavors as it warms.  Rich malts.  Nice bitterness is balanced by spices and rich malts.  Creamy rich mouthfeel.  Alcohol is well hidden.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
811,"2007-09-16",3.7,"Reddish brown color w/ a full frothy light tan head and some good lacing.  Smells good very sweet lots of carmels and raisens some dark fruits.. plums maybe.  Rich well coated palate, lightly creamy.  Flavor is very sweet stewed plums lots of rich carmel malts... definate alcohol flavors as well and they intensify w/ warmth.  Some light floral hop in the swallow as well.  Pretty good stuff.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"

811,"2007-08-15",3.8,"Served in snifter. Copper color with a small, but stable head of off white bubbles. Aromas of raisins dark sugar and plenty of malt. A touch more alcohol comes out as it warms. Quite sweet with caramel, lightly stewed fruit, candi and some floral hops. Too many ale qualities that distract from this being a clean lager, but a nice strong brew either way. Finishes slightly warming and the alcohol really does show up in the last 1/4 of the glass. Strong American Lager/Barleywine/Eisbock interesting effort.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
811,"2007-07-26",4.0,"On tap at the Silver Creek Brew Pub. Poured a deep and cloudy amberish / copper color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of caramel, toffee, light alcohol, fruity, and floral. Tastes of toffee, caramel, brown sugar, and fruity. Medium alcohol burn in the finish.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
811,"2007-07-23",4.1,"Sampled on draught at the brewpub in Cedarburg, Wisconsin. Pours a clear coppery amber brew with a fast dissolving white head that leaves behind an excellent creamy white ring. Aroma of caramel apples, some light pineapple, light golden raisins and a touch of toffee. Taste is smooth, creamy, raisiny sweet with a toffee/apple flavor. Finish is ""uff-dah!"" Over-the-top sweet, creamy, some apples with a slight bitterness with a heavy does of alcohol at 11 percent. Man does tihis brew burn! The beers character is somewhere between Maibock and a Barleywine.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
811,"2007-06-25",4.0,"My wife got me a growler of this at the Strawberry festival.  Dark, brownish color.  Smell of caramel, malt and tons of it, alcohol, spice, wine, little hop, brown sugar, light flowers, rasins, prunes, minor cotton candy and minor smoked wood.  Taste of malt, spiced dark fruit, bread, brown sugar, candy rasins, some vegtables, caramel, little hops, prunes, nuts, alcohol and a sweet to a dry  bitterness at the end.  This was a great Impy Mai-bock.  Tons of sweet malt and alcohol in this one.  Very enjoyable and I still have about 16oz left in the growler.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","KingpinIPA"
