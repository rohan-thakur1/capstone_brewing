545,"2012-12-04",3.7,"on tap at hunahpu day. Pours a light hazy gold with a thin white head. Aroma is big on pineapple with some malt. Taste follows a little on the sweet side especially for this style but i like it, not a bad kolsch, very flavorful","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","jcartamdg"
545,"2012-07-28",4.6,"Very fitting for a hot summer day. A nice golden yellowish pour. Thin white head with nice lacing. Pineapple really shines and comes through in a big way. A hint of bitterness comes through, but not in a off manor. JW has reopened my eyes to a style that I had pretty much written off. Another great job.","Florida, USA","urwithdave"
545,"2012-03-11",3.5,"golden color, aroma is pineapple and earthy hops, flavor is pineapple, earthy hops, slightly tart, crisp and clean","Florida, USA","cooplander"
545,"2011-09-12",3.4,"Draft CCB Fruit in the Room 2011 Cloudy golden ale with a mid-sized, creamy, off-white head. Excellent retention. The aroma is a collection of big-time pineapple, a pinch of white pepper and a splash of Vernors ginger soda. Light to medium-bodied with tickling carbonation. The flavor is well-balanced and refreshing, but I pick up very little pineapple here. Leans slightly bitter. Crisp, fairly clean finish. More like a nice American pale ale than a Kolsch.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
545,"2011-08-22",4.2,"Pours with a nice thick white head, with a wonderful hit of boat loads of pineapple in the nose with a touch of earthy hops in the background. Ah the pineapple comes through in waves this time around, followed by the bitterness of the hops and a bit of malt in the back end. This thing is a super lawn mower beer for sure.","Miami, Florida, USA","JW77"
545,"2011-08-21",3.8,"Pineapple mmmm...Fruit in the Room 2011. I was glad this was on the list. Smelled like acidic pineapples and sour apples with a touch of malt in the background. The pineapple was very prominent and was incredibly fresh smelling. Poured a hazy dark yellow with a light white head. Tasted of fresh pineapples and some slight sourness with a hint of malt. Pretty good and refreshing, just a touch too sour for me but only by a little bit.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
545,"2011-08-21",3.5,"On tap at Fruit in the Room, poured a dark yellow with a white head.  The aroma was a touch of pineapple, and a hint of hops.  Pineapple dominates the flavor, and a hint of bitter aftertaste.  A nice refreshing beer for being outside.","Florida, USA","burg326"
545,"2011-08-21",3.6,"Tap at Fruit in the Room at CCB. Pours golden yellow with a thin white head. Huge acidic nose of pineapple dominates the aroma, very fresh. Taste has a lot of pineapple, but includes a touch of bitterness and earthiness from the hops. Balanced body, well done.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
545,"2011-03-30",4.4,"On-tap at the Hunaphu release... The body is a dark gold with a light white head. A little watery on the head but looks good... The aroma is sweet but subtle pineapple throughout, with a touch of grain notes... The pineapple disappears on the front and you are left with a crisp easy to drink kolsh, a little yeast and sweet grains. Whats amazing about this beer is the finish. The pineapple is back and is so smooth and true to a pineapple, its like drinking some pineapple juice. AMAZING finish. 

In the 70 degree sun this is a perfect crushable beer. High recommendation here, especially if you like pineapples.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
545,"2011-03-15",4.5,"On tap at CC for the Hunahpus release.  Was this beer built for warm sunny summer days in south Florida or WHAT??  Fantastic pineapple nose.  Bright golden/orange in color.  Smooth and refreshing with a well balanced body that has the perfect blend of hops and fruit.  Not to bitter, not to sweet.  Just right for sippin at the beach or by the pool.  WELL DONE!!!!!!!","Florida, USA","50belair"
545,"2011-03-14",4.7,"Yaaaaaaa Buddie! Summer is here and this is the Beer of Choice!!

The nose was amazing pineapple all day! The Balance on the beer couldnt of been more spot on just a subtle hop presence and a well balanced body and the smooth sweetness of pineapple at the finish to make this a grand slam.

Once again fine work Jdub.

545,"2011-03-14",4.4,"Holy Poppin Pineapples, Batman! Probably one of the most creative and well executed kolsches Ive ever tried.  This is one of my favorite styles of beer and it tends to be done quite traditionally . . . Im very glad to see a brewer add some of their personality to it. The appearance is a to-style,  light, hazy gold. Completely clear and translucent, which may have taken some patience and work to accomplish. The nose is as enticing as anything Ive ever tried. Sweet pineapple right up at the front, followed by the spicy fruitiness of the ale yeast. The taste is refreshing and phenomenally balanced! I know pineapple can be  exceptionally difficult to work with due to all that sugar, but it does not overpower this beer and very much remains as a kolsch should be. Clean finish demonstrates a well lagered brew. Hats off to this on!","Florida, USA","Maltzilla"
545,"2011-03-14",4.0,"on tap at CCB.  Wait.....is that smell, pineapple?  The flavor doesnt even have a trace of acidity in it.  This beer is one that absolutely will stun you when you first take a whiff of it.  Everything about the pineapple in this beer was done right.","Denton, Texas, USA","Rosebud butternuts"
545,"2011-03-14",4.3,"Who the hell would have figured a kolsch to get a 4.3?  I wouldnt have.  This one does.  On draft at Hunahpu Day.  Pours a yellow-orange with a white head.  Nose is big on pineapple, hints of sweetness, and grains.  Flavor is similar.  Usually Kolsch beers wear their hearts on their sleeves, but this one has secrets, depth, and several dimensions.  Please make this again!","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
545,"2011-03-12",4.9,"Golden pour with a nice white head. This beer had everyone talking. The owner of CCB and his crew were blown away by this one! Aroma is crisp and lightly malty with a perfect amount of pineapple. Flavor is stunning. A pineapple beer done well? Hell no, done to perfection. Crisp, fruity, pineapple goodness. Wow and wow. By far the best Kolsch and pineapple beer Ive had!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
