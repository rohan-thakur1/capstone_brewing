3912,"2017-05-07",4.0,"Draft at Funky Buddha. Pours a hazy yellow color and topped by a small off white head of foam that slettles quickly to a thin film. The aroma shows huge notes of tart key limes, vanilla cream, lactic sourness, and pie crust. Smells pretty damn close to key lime pie. The flavor follows suit and shows plenty of tart key lime, crisp wheat, vanilla cream, some pie crust, and plenty of lactic sourness. Medium bodied with ample carbonation that leads to a clean, crisp, tart key lime finish. They nailed what they were going for on this one. Easy drinking and refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day. Really well done Berliner Weiss.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
3912,"2017-04-09",3.1,"Verde/amarelado claro de leve turbidez, espuma rala de pouca formação e persistência. Limão do início ao fim, médio azedo e leve dulçor, remeteu a suco artificial em pó. Esperava bem mais.","São Paulo, BRAZIL","Tognetta"
3912,"2017-01-04",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Generous lime and its acidity are met by precise salt and sugar in this pleasant ceviche-invoking Berliner Weisse.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the whitish blond.
-The smooth bubbling due to the Western tap serving doesnt help the mouthfeel that much. Would have helped if it were more effervescent, or drier-feeling.
-This actually drinks like a real Berliner though, so extra points for dosage with the adjuncts! This beer doesnt feel artificial (contrary to their Maple Bacon Coffee Porter).
-Extra point also for pulling off this high level of drinkability (oysters, lime juice, lactobacillus, authenticity nonetheless, etc.).

On tap at the brewery tasting room.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

Pours hazy blond with low white head. Good lacing. Aroma is of fruits, weird vanilla, spices, candies. Taste is of sourness, fruits, citrus, salt. Palate: Light-medium body. Medium carbonation. Overall: Quite good. Maybe too spicy?","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","Minderbinder"
3912,"2015-03-27",3.8,"Sample @ EBF.

Appearance: Hazy pale yellow golden with a small white head and little lacing. 

Aroma: Lime and lemon forward with nice spicy features, meringue and lactic notes. 

Taste: Lime and lemon and spices/cinnamon, mild tartness, lactic notes and meringue sweetness/sugary presence.

Palate: Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation. Never watery. Lingering lime and spicy (mild to moderate) finish. 

Overall: Super tasty Berliner Weisse, maybe even a tad too flavorful. Its still quite drinkable despite all the flavors. Like many Funky Buddha beers, its so close to the real taste they are trying to reproduce that it feels borderline artificial, but again here it stays acceptable... and so damn tasty.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3912,"2015-03-24",3.8,"Sample at EBF. Hazy white gold pour with almost no head. Aroma has lots of lemon, lime, citrusy and citric, nothing really showcasing lime per se, pretty standard berliner aroma, that being said it smells really nice, a bit of spice, maybe a hint of curry.

3912,"2012-08-19",3.9,"Draft at Monks Cafe in Philadelphia, PA. 

Pours a hazy ecto cooler/booger green color with a half finger off-white head that immediately fades away. No retention or lacing. Doesnt look very good. 

The aroma of this beer is pretty crazy. Smells more like a dessert beer with lots of tart lime/citrus, subtle lactic funk and even some whip cream. Smells just like pie but not really like a typical Berliner Weiss. Pretty intense but almost artificial. Still, they nailed what they were going for. 

Medium bodied with soft carbonation and a very sweet and tart lime presence. Again, it tastes very close to the dessert with lots of tart lime and whip cream but this slightly overpowers the characteristics of the style. Decent amount of sourness but only subtle lactic funk and some faint sourdough bread flavor. Really good but could have been legendary if it wasnt as one dimensional.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Really pleasant.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"

3912,"2012-06-04",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2012 Glass from James during the shit show that was Funky Buddha at Monks this year. Thanks for passsing this one back to me brah. Pours hazy golden straw color with massive fluffy white head that dissipated quickly.

Toast, faint lactic acid.  Bright acid with lingering lime zest and another helping of cinnamon.  I liked this, but it was probably my least favorite of the four Berliner Weisses they had at the event, and solely because of the cinnamon overpowering things.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

3912,"2011-12-23",4.3,"On draft at the Funky Buddha, pours a pale key lime color with virtually no head what so ever.  Aromas of tart limes, vanilla, gramcracker, and a smidge of spice.  As soon as I had the first sip it tasted like the key lime pie my fiance makes.  The second sip was more keylime and noticed the gramcraker flavoring, and more key lime.  I normally do not like berliner due to the sourness of the beer, however this one was simply amazing, and out of this world.  Really wish I could get a growler of this to bring back to the Tampa crew.","Florida, USA","burg326"
3912,"2011-10-18",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 16, 2012 Draft This beer rocks! Cloudy straw-colored ale with no head. The aroma is a fruity, acidic swirl of big key lime, faint cinnamon, mild vanilla and a trace of graham. Medium-bodied and very creamy with airy carbonation. The flavor is fruity and as sour as Hell. Loads of delicious key lime and heavy, yeasty acidity. Crisp, tart, clean finish. God, I love key lime pie and this captures it with scary precision.

This was referred to as Key Lime Pie and that is pretty dead on. Nose is insanely awesome. Juicy Key Lime, some light graham cracker (how did they do that??) and some vanilla creme. The appearance I had to give a 5 cause it looks like key lime pie. Color is perfect dead on. Flavor is big super puckery key limes up front with a good hit of vanilla and graham crackery malt (seriously..how?). Finishes fairly sour. Amazing beer. One of my favorites from the Buddha.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
