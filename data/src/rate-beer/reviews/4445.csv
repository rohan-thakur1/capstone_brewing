Light plum-acid nose, faint yeast and moderate acetic, peppery but fairly juicy fruit bordering on apricot given the acid. Sweeter front palate than the other Le Roar b3, more married than others between the acid and fruit, plenty of plum juice and skin--very whole-fruit experience, bright, expressive, and seedy. Sparkling body keeps it playful.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
4445,"2015-12-09",4.4,"Bottle (750 ml) at tasting. Thanks to Frank for this one! Hazy glowing orangey-golden with a medium persistent white head leacing some lacing. Aroma is lovely with the main flavors being juicy plums and great 3-Fonteinen like funk along yogurt, winey notes, brettanomyces, floral notes... bright and complex. Taste doesnt disappoint and is in line with aroma with a bright juicy plum presence, lovely funk, mineral notes, a mild residual sugar presence that likely come from the fruits and add a nice layer of flavor, yogurt again and winey notes. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Winey mouthfeel. Juicy and fruity finish. Lovely and complex while also super easy drinking. Nice juiciness. More Belgian than American in profile. This is a great beer and probably my favorite plum sour (belgian lambics included). Wow!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Nose is quite simply of plums, even more impressive than Tilquins Quetsche and thats saying something. Taste is of candied or maybe jammy plums with a sharp acidity that causes a light pucker. Nice oak. Body is medium, carbonation moderate and mouthfeel a strangely perfect mix between vinous and juicy. Overall a really impressive plums sour, well worth the hype!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

Not really sour in its current state...A little young and undeveloped so Ill have to re-tick in 6 months or so.

4445,"2015-06-30",4.1,"Served on-tap at Hunger-N-Thirst during their second Bullfrog Sour event. Pours hazy Amber / copper orange with a half finger tall white head, quickly dissipating down to a bubbly ring around the edge of the glass, leaving small streaks of lace on the sides of the glass. 


Smells of plum skin and some pulp, mild horse blanket funk and wet basement, minimal to light sweetness, slightest hint of lactic sourness, faint woody oak and base pale malt. Taste is very similar with plenty of plum up front slowly being joined by the must and funk and a bit more sweetness than the nose would imply. It is more tart than sour and the pale malt backing helps even it out a bit. The fruity, dry feel is not really a deterrent and it is surprisingly easy to consume. 


Overall a nice plum ""lambic."" It packs plenty of plum and yet it is still quite drinkable. Really looking forward to getting some bottles of this one.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
