1677,"2016-02-15",3.6,"DATE TASTED: February 15, 2016... GLASSWARE: Samuel Smith pint... OCCASION: To paraphrase the great John Hapes, Never waste a good delayed opening without a beer... APPEARANCE: massive rocky crags of brown head lace like doilies and coral...the black as death body forms ground zero, where the head sloughs unevenly as sea foam--dramatic to look at...would be a ""5"" if it looked this way while carrying more serious alcohol... AROMA: a striking pretzel and warming dough balance with a lactic undercurrent that ultimately is a balance point for the sea salt that brings a robust brine... chocolate and some late phenolic suggestions... PALATE: smooth at the star, like a chocolate stout, with a middleweight¬ís body and a vegetable¬ís slightly astringent finish...TASTE: salty as a pretzel, milky like mousse, this uses some bittering hops (Brewer¬ís Gold?) and a nicely pitched, sweetly roasted malt to build a drinkable, reasonably flavorful stout ... OVERALL: appreciate the conservation initiative... enjoy the overall experience, which is slightly above the sum of its parts... a good companion for a night of ice.. more cola than I look for in a stout, and the rating reflects that....","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"

 Appearance ¬ñ The beer pours very deep brown color with just a hint of light seen shinning trough. Upon pouring there is a one finger of fizzy tan colored head that fades very rapidly to leave just a tiny trace of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell ¬ñ The aroma of the beer is rather big of a roasted malt and coffee smell mixed with some very light dark chocolate notes. As may be expected form an oyster stout, there is also some salty sea like aromas mixed in there as well with just a hint of a charcoal and toast smell as well. 

 Taste ¬ñ The taste begins with a heavy roasted malt flavor with a little bit of a toffee sweetness upfront. The toffee quickly fades giving a very dry and roasty flavor. Along with the nice roasty flavors of the brew, are some faint hints of seawater mixed with a touch of a charcoal and toast taste. While a bit of sea is present on the taste it is very light overall, leaving a mainly drier roasted dark malt flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel ¬ñ The body of the beer is on the medium to slightly thinner side with a carbonation level that is on the average side. A bit of a thicker body would have suited the darker flavors much better, with a slightly lower carbonation level doing the same for the dry and roasted taste.

 Overall ¬ñ Not really much oyster going on in this one. Besides the nose, which gives a decent level of saltiness, overall the brew is really just a drier and roastier stout. OK, but nothing exceptional.","","Darkmagus82"
1677,"2014-10-15",3.1,"Frankly tastes more like a porter to me, but I think that's ok considering that it's for a good cause.

First note, I don't love oysters. But if done right, this brew should bring in something worthwhile that brings character to an otherwise pleasant brew.

Nose is heavy on the caramel malts and very light on hops. Tight but limited head balances on top of a crystal black brew. Taste is... unique. Heavy body and porter-like bitterness comes into the expected stout depth and roasted notes. 

Smokey notes are most of what there is to show on the surface for oyster character, but that's ok. If this were an oyster porter I'd say it was better and, objectively, this brew is more drinkable than most heavy stouts. But for what I expect from a stout, this brew lacks in robustness what it makes up in character.

1677,"2014-09-11",3.3,"I have to admit, I was somewhat terrified to try this beer. Oysters to me taste like rich delicious meaty goodness crossed w/ the most terrible fishy taste I can imagine making them both appealing and repulsive--which is somehow worse than them just being repulsive. Thankfully, I do not taste oysters in this beer. (Perhaps by brewed w/ oysters they mean they boys at Flying Dog were just chillin¬í w/ their oyster boys while they brewed this something, I dunno.) In any case, this is a fairly average stout, I¬íd say: medium sweet, medium roast character, medium carbonation and medium bodied w/ no off flavors or anything wrong going on at all. It is a bit raisiny w/ slight chocolate and coffee notes. I had my wife taste it--she is a great lover of oysters--and she feels it would be a perfect match for them so, you know, try the combo if you like to partake and let us know how you feel.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

I¬íve always had this in pint glasses.
The appearance was a nice dark brown close to black color with a decent half finger white foamy head that dies at a nice pace and leaves a light lacing about it.
The smell was dry and dark and roasty. Honestly, I really didn¬ít get much of any ""oyster""/brininess of any of the sorts.
The taste was mainly just dark and roasty.
On the palate, it sat at/about a light to medium in body. The carbonation was fairly good for the style and for me. It was slightly dry but not too sharp.
Overall, I say this was a decent Irish Dry Stout worthy of having again, but not much of an ""oyster stout.""","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Palate: The body is lighter for the style, with a somewhat creamy and easy drinking feel

1677,"2013-03-28",4.4,"I love true oyster stouts (or better, ""mollusc"" stouts, as NZ has great clam & mussell stouts too) for the brine and the saltiness that that create this perfect trinity with sweetness and bitterness. However, I was a bit concerned when I learnt that the Rappahannock oysters were the sweetest of all the east coast true oysters. Where would the ""brine"" be then? Well, not to worry. This is a fabulous stout, truly briney and salty (and apologies for the abuse of words ending with a ""y""). Not much of a thrilling aroma, rather fruity, with a bit of plum and a touch of chocolate, free of that oiled leather of heavily hopped stouts and free of coffee. Black as sin, but not a pun on the spilling sin of Onan, perhaps an inspiration for the clever name. The flavour is a wonderful balance of the bitter chocolate, the sweetness of prunes (and RR oysters), the seasalt - I know that it is likely not even there anyway - and a buttered brown toast with a thin film of vegemite. Not a hint of coffee, for which I am thankful. Flavours all very well blended, roundly smoothed into a not-too-complex result. Still, superb! Not too dry, neither to start with, nor in the end, so I don¬ít understand what makes this a ""dry stout"".

Taste: Lightly charry breadcrusts, some milk chocolate, and a little splash of mild coffee. Modestly sweet. Lightly fruity. Leafy, spicy hops, not overblown, and giving a light bitterness. A little briny, salty, but not much, really. Gently roasty, lightly chocolaty finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium carbonation.

Overall: A particularly light oyster stout with only the faintest hints of the salty, briny, mineral-laden overtones that most have. Go on, slip one to your vegan friends.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Palate: Full body, creamy texture, average carbonation, long salty finish
Overall: Interesting...I¬ím not sure the oyster addition works completely for me, but I think I see where the brewers are going, and they balanced it well. That being said, this is a bizarre try-it-one-time beer, at best, and not one I would seek out again.","Ohio, USA","pottygok"

The nose is quite roasty and burnt with a slight mineral and briney note. A rather thick and aggressive nose compared to what I was expecting. The flavor is pretty nice, roasty and dry with that underlying brine note that I suppose comes from the oysters. Finishes with a mix of chocolate and a light malt bitterness. Medium bodied and fairly chewy texture with soft fizzy carbonation.  This is pretty good among the oyster beers that I¬íve had in the past.

1677,"2013-02-14",3.6,"On draft at Buffalo Wild Wings in Waldorf.

The beer is black with a half inch of creamy, beige head that coats the glass with filmy lacing. The aroma offers roasted malt, biscuits. It certainly smells like an English stout. I can't detect any oyster presence in the aroma or the flavor, but perhaps it's better if the oyster character is subtle. Still, I'd like it to be more present. The beer tastes fine otherwise. Light to medium in body with appropriate carbonation. Low alcohol and well balanced. What it lacks in character it atones for, at least to a certain degree, with drinkability.

1677,"2013-02-12",3.5,"Flying Dog Pearl Necklace is essentially the same as any other Dry Stout, but brewed with oysters. However, there is no oyster character to the beer, so in the end all you¬íre left with is a decent stout.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a goblet.

Appearance: Dark, opaque black body. Forms a small, dark tan, soapy head which mostly dissipates and doesn¬ít retain or lace very well.

Smell: Standard dry stout aroma of cola, dairy aisle, light roasted malt, and a hint of coffee. 

Taste: I¬ím not sure if brewing stouts with oysters is a new thing or a traditional method. I¬íve had a few before and the oyster flavor has been mild but noticeable, plus it complemented the palate well. In the case of Flying Dog Pearl Necklace the oysters seem to be missing in action. The core beer itself is a traditional dry stout. A bit more robust than Guinness and noticeably sweeter. There¬ís almost a bit of anise or other root beer or cola-like flavors here (almost). There¬ís a slight milky taste at the peak, similar to that of a milk stout, but nothing much in the way of roasted barley or coffee. 

If this beer hadn¬ít been marketed as an ""oyster stout"" I¬íd probably score it a little higher. The fact its selling point is absent from the taste makes it a bit disappointing. Still, the palate as a whole is satisfying and enjoyable, but nothing close to amazing. 

Drinkability: Flying Dog Pearl Necklace may be more bark than bite. Though extremely dark, it¬ís not even close to being anything imperial. The mouthfeel is light, thin, noticeably fizzy, but a bit refreshing across the tongue. The finish is clean so it¬ís easy to drink fast or slow since there¬ís no cloyingness. At 5.5% it¬ís technically a bit too big to session, though the mild palate and drinker-friendly delivery make it an ideal candidate for a waiver.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

1677,"2013-02-09",3.8,"Bottle @ Ur√∏rt, Bergen. Pours a pitch black body with a small off-white head. Nose is licorice, leather, mild chocolate and coffee tones with hints of toffee and something slightly salty which could be the *actual* oysters used in the brewing of this beer. Taste is chocolate, licorice, caramel, toffee and hints of that oyster-like soy-ish element evident in the aroma, along with grains and straw. Smooth and surprisingly full body (or maybe not, considering the *actual* oysters in the boil), medium carbonation. Very pleasant again from Flying Dog, and a nice take on the ""oyster""-theme.

1677,"2013-02-08",4.2,"Pours black with no head. Amazing coffee and chocolate aroma. It is indeed a dry stout, bordering perhaps a wee too much towards bitterness. However, the dryness does permit the nice roastiness and coffee and chocolate notes to come through in the flavor easily. The oysters give it perhaps a bit of kick; I'm not sure if its necessary or makes the beer better, but it does make the brew different. Overall, pretty good.

Appearance: The beer pours a dark brown but is pitch black in my glass, only a thin tan head with poor retention, leaves a thin coating and a messy ring.
Aroma: Roasted malts and cocoa, make up the aroma, there¬ís a slight brine, though it could be me adding it mentally due to the style of the beer.
Taste: Roasted malts and cocoa are on the intro with a light smoke, there¬ís a light brine here that shows up a bit on the finish. The finish is rather dry and leaves a light smoke lingering.
Palate: Medium body, oily texture, and a fair amount of lightly fizzy, lightly sparkling carbonation.
Overall: I like this except on the finish, the finish has this dry light brine and smoke combination that lingers. This is decent, but it¬ís just the finish I don¬ít like, it detracts from the overall experience for me.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

1677,"2012-08-25",3.6,"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip.

A: Pours a very dark burgundy color that¬ís almost porteresque in its color shade. The head is a one finger mocha color with lowish retention, fading into a decent collar around the glass. Not much lacing.

S: Typical of a good porter/stout, it features mainly coffee, slight darker fruit, and dark bakers chocolate. In addition, it features a briny saltiness in its scent that betrays its usage of oysters quite well. I¬ím really enjoying how this smells, even if it¬ís not the strongest aroma in the world.

T: Tart and fruity, with a light kiss of brine. Compared to the scent, there¬ís much less coffee and chocolate in the flavor, and a lot more lactose and dark fruits. A bit acidic, as well. It¬ís hard to find the usage of oysters in the flavor profile - but they¬íre there. I¬íd like a little more roast here, but it¬ís a nice enough stout.

M: Light bodied, with a prickly texture, high carbonation, and dry finish. Similarly to the flavor, it¬ís slightly acidic as it goes down the esophagus, but it¬ís still easy going down. In a way, it almost drinks like an Irish stout.

O: This is one I can really see coming to its own on tap. A decent no-frills stout with great intentions, I¬íd pair this one with (what else?) oysters.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Black with tan edges in glass, tan bubbly head, some lacing
Aroma - soft roasted malts, some dark caramel malts, slightly salty, no hops, bit of roast coffee
Taste - soft roasted malts, some dark caramel, soft coffee, not really getting the oysters, touch of bitter hops in background, very faint fruity floral ester in there, all rather understated, seems to drink at 4.5%
Palate - bit fizzy, medium body. Finish - Dry, more roast malt noticeable also touch more saltiness, bitter linger, cleans off palate
Overall - Understated for Flying Dog, not getting the oysters apart from a hint of seaside saltiness. As a dry stout it¬ís pretty good.","Near Carrick-on-Shannon, IRELAND","stravale"

Some discernible oyster aromas in there, I¬ím pretty sure... It¬ís more noticible in the finish than the other couple of oyster stouts I¬íve tried. Really tasty overall, crisp and kind of refreshing stout. Lighter body. I really enjoyed this, and have picked up it to enjoy again several times after my initial review.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

1677,"2012-05-05",3.9,"I am not generally a fan of this type of stout, however, it surprised me.  Body was light, flavor was rich and deep.  Beer was dry throughout, which I believe is  a result of the sea salt which is included in the mix.  Even though this beer is full of flavor, the light body makes this a possible session beer.","Maryland, USA","pras"
