Very clean on lager flavors with minimal yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice.

Aroma: The nose has a fairly rich sweetness with mostly fruit and caramel malt notes

Appearance: It pours a slightly hazy amber-orange color with a thin head and light lace

Flavor: Tastes mid-heavy sweet, similar to the nose with lots of caramel malts and fruity flavors

Palate: The body medium, it is a little bit sticky and a little creamy on the mouth, with a soft carbonation

Overall Impression: 
For me, this one was a little too sweet, and lacked hop balance, but I still found it to be a pretty solid offering.  It had a really solid drinkability to it, and works nicely on the mouth.  The aroma is fairly bold, while a not super complex, and the taste lives up to what youre expecting from the nose.

1757,"2011-04-22",3.0,"12 ounce bottle - $1.69 at Olde Crabapple Bottle Shoppe in Alpharetta, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a clear, amber-brown body with a white head topping one inch.

Smell: Mildly bready, yeasty-toned aroma with a toasted accent to it and supporting notes of fruit and powdered spices.

Taste: Lightly toasty, lightly nutty malts with a mild touch of sugared sweetness. Spicy, yeasty, estery, and with a small bit of dried citrus midway, all pretty fleeting. Faintly bitter. Drying finish, with a slackening, thinning body.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium-light carbonation.

Overall: Though it lacks the real depth of character and malt complexities of the finer examples, its still suitable as a mild, easy-drinking lager.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Why did I choose this beer for #1000?  Simple, it was the first craft beer I ever tasted, and it had a profound impression on the way I looked at beer.  Previous to sampling this beer at one of the early Lakefront brewery tours in 1991, I thought beer was pissy yellow stuff that was consumed solely to remove sobriety.  This beer was different, and the approach of the brewers was different.  The Lakefront guys taught us about what beer was, and how they, as an extremely small brewery at the time, had gotten to where they were.  I was completely consumed by the story, and the beer was fantastic.  Granted, Lakefront was far from the first to do this, they were just the first one I noticed.  Would I have become a craft beer enthusiast without this beer?  Of course, I think that was inevitable.  However, this beer is singularly present in my mind as the beer that showed beer could be something more, and something important.  In a not so small way, this singular experience opened my mind to exploring food, wine, coffee, etc, the list could go on and on.  Thank you Jim.  Thank you Russ.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

(And lo and behold, it shows up at Bierkraft one beautiful day) When most people totally go on about how great something is, I am usually like, yeah, sure. Cuz it ends up being a let down. But Andrew and I share similar tastes and when he says something regarding food is good, it is. So... 

Pours a clear darker amber. Nose is airy. Very slight touch of caramel coated roasted apples. If only it were a bit more pronounced, Id give it a 4. Flavor is very smooth, but robust with a defined sweet tone. Almost seems like an apple variation is hitting me. When I lived in Hawaii, I would pick mountain apples (a.k.a. Malay apples) off trees on certain hiking trails. I think this reminds me of that a bit, though it has been a very long time since I had one of those apples. This is a bit heavier than the apples, and that is due to the malts. Feel is great with carbonation and has a nice thicker and smooth liquid feel. Overall, very drinkable. Would be extremely interested in trying this on-tap, and what if...what if it were on cask? Hmmm. Interesting apple qualities on this one. This is why I trust Andrews judgment. 

Edit: After walking down the street to go throw my laundry in the dryer, I dwelled on the lingering aftertaste and it is totally mountain apples. Interesting indeed.

Bottled during Feb. 06. Rated 12/23/06. This has held up a little better than other old Lakefront beers I found in their variety pack. Pours a caramelly brown, little head but lots of fizziness. Smell brings in a nice amber malt profile with some German hoppiness. Listed abv is a tad higher than their other bottles, and may have helped keep it a little longer. This does have a nice sticky amber malt taste with a good bitter balance. It is starting to turn a bit papery, and the soda pop style carbonation doesnt suit the taste at all.

1757,"2006-01-25",4.7,"One of the first Lakefront beers that really piqued my attention, was their Riverwest Stein Beer. The reason I was so interested was I initially believed this beer was an actual stein bier or stone beer. What is stein bier? It is a unique German beer style where hot rocks(stones) are submerged in the brew kettle while the beer is brewing. The sugars of the malt caramelize and coat the hot rocks. These hot rocks are then allowed to cool, and are put in the lagering tanks where they add caramel/toffee flavors to the brew. As it turns out Riverwest Stein Beer is NOT a stone beer, stein in this case just refers to the drinking vessel. 

While I was a bit disappointed that this was not a stone beer, Lakefront more than made up for it with this beer. This beer is absolutely delicious. It is a malty/toasty amber lager with fantastic malt character, and a wonderful hop presence that balances out this beer. This beer is a Milwaukee favorite, and it is easy to see why. Riverwest Stein Beer pours to a beautiful deep amber color with a thick off white head, and a good bit of carbonation. The nose is just packed with sweet and toasty malt aromas with a subtle back drop of hop aromatics. The body is firm with lots of good sweet malt, caramel malt, and toasty flavor. A portion of unmalted barley is used in the brewing of this beer really making the malt flavors shine in this beer. Riverwest Stien beer finishes with more great malt flavor then is balanced with a nice, dry hop bitterness making this beer quite balanced at the end. 

This is a fantastic amber lager with really great malt flavors. This beer is the perfect foil for grilled meats such as bratwurt, or a nice juicy burger. This would also match up extremely well with pizza. If ever in the Cream City of Milwaukee, seek this beer out.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
1757,"2006-01-15",2.9,"I dont know what to say.  I thought this beer was mediocre at best.  Now I find out its Lakefronts second best rated beer.  No way is it a 3.6+.  Let me let you in on a secret.  This beer is the exact same as the Cream City Pale Ale.  Only difference is this one is dominated by the malt.  They used the exact same hops just steeped in more grain and used lager yeast.  Too full bodied to enjoy for such a lame tasting beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"

Tart sour grass dominates the flavor -- not at all appropriate for a Vienna, though Im not sure it should be categorized as such since there is no indication the brewer brewed it to be a Vienna-style lager.

1757,"2005-09-30",3.1,"(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with footbalm, thanks Eric!) Half an inch of light-tan head covers the hazy, ruddy amber body.  At first, the mildly aromatic nose is sweet, caramely, and lightly malty, with a balancing touch of hops, but as more headspace opens up, the beer opens up as well and becomes more malty and caramely.  But this is a much more flavorful beer than the initial aroma lets on.  It starts sweet and very caramely, and then is somewhat balanced by a moderate bitterness.  But that bitterness eventually turns a bit harsh late in the finish, resulting in a slightly acerbic aftertaste.  This was bottled the end of April, 2005, so this is five months old and should have had enough time for that harshness to fully mellow out.  Medium bodied.  The sweetness sits on the palate, and youd think the bitterness would help to clean that out a bit, but it doesnt.  This is okay, but theres just something about the way this beer finishes that puts a damper on what is otherwise a very nice beer.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

I could see myself drinking this from a great one liter stein in a beer garden some summer afternoon.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Amber-to-copper in color and translucent with a pillowy, fluffy white head.  Aroma is sweet and spicy - pulling on toffee, caramel, roasted aspects and a dash of pepper.  Taste proceeds in an amplified fashion of what we expected in aroma: smooth yet spicy and an all-encompassing flavor department.   Caramel, cinnamon rolls without icing and mild butterscotch flavors jive harmoniously with the roasted nature and substantial malt support.  Slightly bitter with a moderately aggressive edge to balance the lager.  Dry finish.  Damn good beer.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Great texture right up front, and a very mellow mouthfeel. Little hops, but substantially malty. Thats what this beauty is all about, and it delivers a fantastic, rewarding taste all the way through. Rich, tasty, lush, warm and friendly, full in body, this is a malty masterpiece.

1757,"2004-01-02",4.0,"tasted beside a penn oktoberfest and a hacker-pschorr of the same persuasion, this vienna is mostly notable-- not for it's predictably toasty caramel malts-- but for the grapefruit-like bitterness that attends each swallow.  it's a classic clear amber, like the back-lit tail feathers of a redtail hawk. the head is present,  but it apparently has an architectural preference for 'ranch' as opposed to 'high rise'-- meaning simply that my sample remained kinda low to the surrounding landscape.  aroma features a spritz of alcohol amid the pie-crust malts, the slo-poke toffee notes, and that ruby red grapefruit in the enchantingly conspicuous hops. it's a full-flavored vienna, and --given time-- features the usual arc of carbonation from brisk to soft. sweetness to bitterness aspects are in full accord.  deservedly renouned.

1757,"2003-11-14",4.0,"Piney hop aroma, which threw me off a little after reading the ""ALL MALT AMBER LAGER"" note right in the middle of the label. Amber lager's or Viennas, for that matter, are not known for their hops, and with a statement like ""All malt"" I expected no hops. Promising. Body is an attractive reddish amber with a small, whispy off white head. There are some visible particles, but not enough to make for as much as a cloudy appearance per se. Excellent lace. Initial mouthfeel backs up the aroma in that there are indeed hops. There are hints of thinness in the finish, but there is enough substance here to carry it. This beer is totally falsely advertised. It is a sweet hoppy beer, albeit with an abundance of caramelly roasted malt. Is it balanced? Yes. However, it's primary flaw would be that it is a little overly sweet.

1757,"2002-09-14",4.1,"Nice amber color, with a thick long lasting head. Malty smell, with a bit of fruit. Fantastic mouthfeel, light and crisp. The taste is subtle and hard to define...slightly caramelly, but with a sweeter bite to it. It feels like the opposite of the Belgians Ive tried. While those club you over the head with a variety of flavors, here the flavors are in the background, blended together well. A laid-back beer, if that makes any sense. Goes down very smooth, and I could see making this one of my everyday beers.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","Pjones6738"
1757,"2002-09-14",3.9,"Deep,bright amber. Minimal head. Huge nose of malt, caramel, hops, touch of peat and others. Medium bodied that has a bit of a watery texture, lots of toasty malt flavors, caramel, cascades are there but the malts keep them at bay. I love malt:)  A damn fine vienna but I think I like Elliot Ness a bit more. Thank you Psychprof.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
1757,"2002-09-12",2.2,"Explosively foamy out of the botle, in the exact manner of the Lakefront Cream City Pale Ale I recently rated. What little beer there was left in the bottle was moderately tasty, but I can see what others have meant about the Lakefront freshness problem. My Riverwest Stein was bottled in July (2002, presumably) and was purchased in Appleton, Wisconsin, so there really shouldnt have been any problem with it. Im disappointed in Lakefront so far; my apologies to my esteemed colleague muzzlehatch.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","baseballguy"
1757,"2002-08-30",4.2,"Nice amber pour with a big white head.Nice aroma, a little sweetness,malt a hint of hops. This is a delicious beer. Very satisfying and  definately has the ability to be a top rate session beer.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
1757,"2002-08-17",4.4,"Pours like a glass of iced tea, with a frothy, disintegrating head.  Nice whiffs of biscuity malt, honey, almond, and tangy Cascades.  Startling complexity for a lager, with different aspects of this beer calling for attention at each sip.  Seems to defy categorization, sometimes like a bitter, sometimes like an Oktoberfest, maybe even an APA?  This rating is for the superb bottled version, but it is even better on draft in Milwaukee.  
Also, a very neat, colorful label; in fact, one of my favorites in recent memory.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
1757,"2002-08-16",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2006 Possibly Lakefronts best beer.  Love the Vienna style.  Nice malty flavor.  Too bad this is only regional!","Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, USA","kmeves"
1757,"2002-08-14",4.0,"I almost thought this was an ale--very fruity and complex.  My first Vienna outside Mexico and I like it a lot.  Nice hope bouqet and flavor--balanced well with malt.  Smooth finish.","Washington DC, USA","jskendzel"
1757,"2002-08-04",4.4,"Yknow, I kinda like the Vienna style. For example, I thought the Aass Juleol and Smutty Lager were pretty good. Then, this weekend, I pick up a six of this. I had one each night at my Siss, thinking Holy cow, this is incredible! Malting is perfecto here; has more snap than European versions, more crispness, especially when warming. Then, theres a hop bite not readily apparent in other lagers of any type. Outstanding.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
1757,"2002-07-25",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 22, 2007 Rerate: Not entirely sure what style this is, but its rather malty, with a touch of sourness (not a bad thing).  Very flavorful.  A hint of bitterness.  Everytime I taste this (Ive had four), it strikes me as being different from most other beers and somewhat unusual for a lager to be so flavorful.  Fantastic stuff!  Thirst-quenching.
Rerate 8/07: Perhaps more bitter than I remembered, but I like it!","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
1757,"2002-07-07",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2006 Smoky aroma and a very solid malt structure. Soft, perfumey hops; cinnamon, roasted coffee, and chocolate. Off-tan foam- little stick, great retention. Bronze liquid. Full mouthfeel; gentle carbonation. Medicinal edge in the forefront which numbs the palate. Red apples in the finish. Pretty good.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1757,"2002-06-03",3.4,"Hazy amber; vienna malts and slight pear fruitiness in the nose. Decent cara-toasty malts; smooth, but seems subdued.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1757,"2002-06-01",2.9,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2008 Bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is clear medium to dark amber. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (cookie, toasted grain), lightly hoppy (flowers, apricot). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter, slightly husky. Medium body, watery  texture, lively carbonation, slightly metallic. Not a whole lot going on, and rather metallic in the finish, but ok.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1757,"2002-03-07",3.9,"A good amber.  A good malt nose and good balance.  Lacks some toastiness that I look for in this style.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1757,"2002-01-27",4.9,"One of the best beers to come out of Milwaukee in many years. A draft pitcher of fresh Stein may be as close to heaven as Ill get!","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","johnnymilwaukee99"
1757,"2001-12-10",4.5,"As near to perfection as a lager can be.  Great color, wonderful hop/malt balance, a nice caramel sweetness and some earth-tones, totally smooth and easy finish.  12/10 rerating (bottled).  Cant believe I dont have to change a single number, but there it is.  Would just mention the powerful malt presence all the way through; palate gives you just enough hops to keep it from being too syrupy-sweet-smooth.  Wonderful, though I personally would put the Klisch Pilsener at the top of the brewers heap.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1757,"2001-11-26",5.0,"This is, by far, my favorite beer.  Big chewy malts blened smoothly and clearly.  Wow - I think Ill go get one!","USA","lagerman99"
