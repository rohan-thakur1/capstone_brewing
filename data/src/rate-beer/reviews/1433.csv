1433,"2017-01-13",3.5,"Bomber from Healthy Spirits Cortland. Heater Allen? Barely even know her! Cloudy chestnut color with a one finger off white head. Aroma is nice, nutty, caramel, toasted bread, tree sap. Flavor is dry and medium bitter with a touch of sweetness. Caramel, woody, nice for the style. Medium body with average carbonation. Nice to see an American brewery do alt right. Ah crap didnt mean to say alt right. Those guys suck.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

1433,"2016-05-01",3.4,"Bomber. Big fat malty nose, light prune, quite nutty. Dark amber color, thick beige head, and thick lace. Mild toasty malt, bitterness hits in mid, then some gentle dark fruit and nuts, dry finish. Thin-medium body. Heavier flavors than expected. Possibly infected. But still fairly pleasant.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
1433,"2016-04-30",3.4,"Bomber. Dry, minerally nose, caramel, pencil lead. Smells infected, though not in a huge way. Nice malty flavor, chocolate, nuts, dry and minerally. Again the minerals are strong, and so is bitterness, hoppy as well. It has the dry, airy carbonation that along with the pencil nose seems like an infection. Still interesting, with nice malt and hoppy.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
1433,"2016-01-01",3.5,"This poured a darker red with an off white head. Aroma was of caramel, light fruit, and grass. Flavor similar, very clean, but not overly sweet like most alts. First heater Allen Ive had and Im impressed.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
1433,"2015-11-19",1.4,"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle. This bottle has serious problems, it gushed everywhere and poured with an excessive amounts of carbonation. The aroma is very tasty and harsh. The flavor is fruity, nutty, tasty. This is very dry and astringent. Footbalmed(drain pour)","Bountiful, Utah, USA","Gription79"

Bottle: The aroma consists of caramel, toffee, light fruit, and nuts. It pours a hazy orangish-brown with a small beige head that fades to a thin film outlined by a soapy ring. There is some dotted lacing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor start with light-moderate caramel, toffee, and a hint of molasses. The finish has light-moderate roasted nuts. Its medium bodied with a mild carbonation","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
1433,"2015-11-03",3.1,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2016 Bottle. Lightly hazed ruby-brown body with an off-white head of some retention. Nutty and toasty amber malt with a touch of roast / burnt bread crust, cola, red apple skin, marzipan, mild off-note of tomato and metal. Medium bodied, rich and malty and savory, semi-sweet with moderate bitterness. The finish is a little short and its a little yeasty and unclean, but the whole effect is nice enough. 

2016 bottle: Fruity as in dates and raisin and lots of dark caramel, malty-nutty as in filberts and wet leaves, and slightly dirty as in dog hair and soil.  Medium-light bodied, crunchy and toasty with moderate bitterness in a drying finish, showing notes of peppercorn.  Kind of plain and unexciting.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1433,"2015-10-19",3.6,"Bomber from Hayduke that we had together via facebook chat. This is dark brown. I think it is clear but the brown is so deep it is difficult to tell. An almost white head is small and very distinctive sitting on top. A malty aroma includes caramel. As it warmed it briefly smelled a little like grape jelly, too. Very grainy flavor to start. Almost like drinking grains. When it warmed spicy sulfury citrus bitter hops were tasted. So, not exactly to style Just a hint of smoke on the finish. This beer should not be served under 60F. Anything colder keeps subtleties from emerging. This beer began with a mouth full of grain and somehow ended up with a mouth full of something like Cascade. Pineapple and maybe even some coconut. But that grain is still there. Throw in some nuts. I love the transformation this beer made. It is a classic example of why you take a beer through temperature changes.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
1433,"2015-10-19",3.6,"Shared with Strykzone on Facebook Chat. We had fun analyzing this beer and searching out it subtle nuances and discussing them. Pours dark amber with a beige head. Rich caramel malt nose and some dark fruit. Medium body. Flavor is caramel malts and lots of subtle other flavors. I get fruit, smoke, nuts and it shows citrus, spice, and sulfur in a citrus bitter finish. Tough to analyze but complex and nice drinking.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
1433,"2015-10-18",3.2,"Aroma of rich caramel and slight chocolate. Walnuts. Almost an orange aspect hidden in the back. Pristine copper with a khaki head. Taste is malty, but there is a metallic aspect to it. Moderate bitterness. Lacks some of the full, rounded maltiness of the style.","Redwood City, California, USA","Zymurgeist2"

1433,"2015-06-17",3.2,"Draught at Lardo, Portland, as Heater Allen Altbier, 5.75% ABVDark amber to brown color, clean. A good lean caramelly brew, not exactly an Altbier bit pleasant, nutty.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

1433,"2015-02-23",3.9,"Bottle shared by bhensonb. Pours light amber with a nice beige head and a sweet malty aroma. There is a hearty caramel malt flavor with a more bitter finish. A nice example of the style.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
1433,"2015-02-23",3.8,"Bomber from The Davis Beer Shoppe. Pours dark copper with a beige head. Nice clean dark caramel aroma with a touch of noble hop. Med body. Flavor is smooth creamy caramel with spicy hop. Delicate in a way. Finishes bitter and not too dry. Dry enough tho.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1433,"2015-02-16",4.0,"Bottle pour into proper glass wear. Pours amber brown with practically no head. Aromas of fresh baked bread, pipe tobacco, nougat, and fresh fruit. Flavor is the same plus a lingering cascade of roasted malt with a nutty aftertaste. This is almost exactly what I remember an Altbier tasting like when I visited Dusseldorf. Fantastic beer.","Pennsylvania, USA","digrod"
1433,"2015-01-12",3.4,"22 ounce bottle purchased at The Davis Beer Shoppe. the aroma is rather subdued on it, but I get some tobacco hints and light floral and berry light sweetness. Munich malt? Transparent cola-colored body with a smallish cream-colored head. Relatively weak. Starts with some pretty toasted malts. Light caramel sweetness in the middle, before more toastiness comes through late. Mild grassy bitterness very late. Has a nice mineral character, and the sharp toastiness in the middle is ever so slightly burnt. A very interesting beer, but it could use a tad more carbonation.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
1433,"2014-12-26",3.8,"22 oz. bottle from Berkeley Bowl. It pours a very dark amber color with red highlights and a small khaki head. The aroma is kinda Bock-like with rich malt melanoidins, hints of red fruits like cherry, plum and raisin bread with some toast. The flavor has a bit more hop character that you would expect from an Alt as compared to a Bock. Earthy, floral character up front followed by a bit of caramel and cherry, well developed maltiness with a medium earthy bitter finish. The body is medium and the carbonation is a tad on the low side. A very well made and tasty beer.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
1433,"2014-11-12",3.7,"I am guessing this is the same beer in bottle form 5.7% alc.
22 oz bottle purchased from Lifesource Natural Grocers in Salem OR.
$4.99
Pours a dark amber/chestnut colour with a very small bubbly tan head.
 Very malty alt style aromas..earthy,leaves a bit of chocolate..nice stuff.
Very balanced taste with a slight earthiness and bitter aftertaste.
Mouth feel is excellent very smooth with low carbonation.
Nice authentic alt beer.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
1433,"2013-11-19",4.4,"Thanks for the ""heads up"", Jeff!
Medium-dark earth-tone, fiery highlights, and pretty forest mushroom foam.
Earthy malt, crisp Fall leaves, with nuances of bramble fruit on the nose. The taste reminds of authentic bread pudding, European-style caramel, and black cherry reduction; all without any of the overt sweetness. Firm, tight, and wonderfully clean. Willkommen zum Herbst.","Wilderness, WA, USA, ","brewolf"
1433,"2013-11-16",4.0,"On tap at Belmont. Where you at 3/4? Pours a dark ruddy copper color with a medium off-white almost beige head. The aroma is big sweet malts, some berries and toffee. The flavor is wonderful and quite seasonal: caramel, earthy, sweeter fruit maybe pomegranate, some strawberry perhaps, candied fruit. But really its core isnt super sweet but clean and smooth. Very nice. I could drink a liter...or two.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
