The beer is golden orange and mildly hazy with a soft head of broken bubbles. The aroma is fantastic, offering apricots, stone fruits, wild yeast. Smells like a fantastic Russian River beer. The flavor is distinctly Russian River. Well balanced and fantastic, with apricots and plums. Sour and tart, and very easy to drink. A very anticipated beer that definitely delivered.

A great example of a Russian River sour leaning toward the lighter side, perfect for summer.

Pours a very dark golden orange/copper color with a one finger frothy white head that slowly fades into a thick lasting ring.  Streaks of lace left behind.

Slightly funky aroma with sweet fruit, vinegar, earthy oak and subtle vanilla creaminess.  Lactic funk with earthy barnyard and brett notes.  Under the funk there is a prominent light fruit presence with hits of apple and strawberry.  Slightly floral with some zesty spice and a touch of acetic vinegar.  

Medium bodied but on the lighter end with a funky, puckering tart character up front without being very acidic.  This is balanced by a faint malt backbone along with some earthy oak, vanilla, cream and light berries, especially strawberry and cherry.  Lingering acetic finish.  

Overall this was pretty good but not one of Russian Rivers best sours. Ive had it once before and remember it being more sour and complex. Perhaps it varies from batch to batch? Either way, this was a nice beer that is worth seeking out.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
3137,"2011-04-14",3.5,"Thanks to Relative Brewing for securing this nectar for this tasting. Served in a mini-snifter.

Pours a slightly-hazy apricot color with a half-finger of head. Aroma brings some really nice notes of grapefruit juice along with the zest of a Ruby Red. There is a slight sour character in the nose, though not all that much comes through. A find a bit of purple plum in there, but that character seems a bit muted.

The flavor melds the citrus peel character with some plum and red grapes. A good level of pucker factor hits here, though not nearly as much as is generally the case with Russian River. All together, the taste is definitely more integrated and complex than the nose, but doesnt really take it to the next level. The finish is fairly dry and is probably the best component of this beer, although at the same time it does drink quite well and is certainly more quaffable than a few of their other wilds.

Pretty balanced...The taste represents more of the oak than I would like, loses a lot of the citrus and acidity.

Compunction was my favorite on the day besides the killer batch of Supplication. Compunction pours a hazy light gold with a small, white head. Soft carbonation and scant white lacing. Aroma is the highlight of this beer. serious white vinegar, RR house funk, lambic like impending lactic acidity, but there is also fresh tropical melons, citrus, nothing that I personally could identify as ""plumcot"". Rather I pick up apricot, peach, caramel. Fleshy apricot abounds. Taste is light and refreshing with some big lactic tartness and serious fruit skin earthiness. The beer is not so much a ""sour"" as it is fully lactic and tart with a big presence of plum flesh that you feel like you are biting into.

Overall, another really awesome sour from Russian River. Never surprising but always enjoyable.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

3137,"2010-12-02",4.3,"Thanks to cloudskipper for the tip.  Draft, Russian River.  Very excited to try this beer and it did not disappoint.  On the more sour/acetic end of things for a RR sour right out of the gate.  Good fruit flavor.  You can definitely taste the pluots, but they dont come through as strong as the fruit in some RRs sours.  Sort of tasted like it had spent awhile in the barrel.  Good oak flavor.  Sour lemons, mild cheesy funk, mild bitterness.  Good lactic character.  Lots of wild character in the finish.  Very refreshing.  Mouthfeel was a bit lighter and less bracing than RRs bigger sours.  This was more in line with Deification/Framboise for a Cure/Beatification.  Just a wonderful beer to drink - had about four glasses.  As much as I liked it, it wasnt necessarily better than RRs normal sours, which are all similarly awesome beers.  Just nice to try one more variation.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3137,"2010-11-30",4.0,"A: The pour is a hazy golden orange color with a fingers worth of white head and some spotty lacing.

S: The nose starts off with lots of tannins from the oak and pluots. A nice lactic acidity provides some lemony tartness, along with pluots in terms of the fruit. Wet oak and grass give the requisite funkiness.

T: Very, very earthy and tannic. Lots of dry oak notes along with pluot skins. A slight fruity character from the pluots as well a fairly mild lactic acidity. Theres a bit of a chalky dryness and astringency, too.

M: The body is medium with a moderate to high carbonation and a very dry finish.

D: After how much this beer was talked up, I tried to be realistic going into it and I think I was. This was indeed a very good beer, but so are pretty much all of Russian Rivers beers.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3137,"2010-01-09",4.0,"Guest tap @ DLD 08 (from notes).  Pours a hazy golden color with a dense medium sized white head.  The aroma is tart citrus: lemon, orange, barnyard funk, some acidity, Brett but not overdone, fruity (I can only imagine this is the pluots, but I get an apricot more then a plum).  The flavor is a wonderful blend of sour citrus, ripe apricots, mild funk,  acidity without being too over the top.  Finish is dry and sour, but remains very drinkable.

3137,"2009-03-01",4.4,"Sampled with my cousin krkearn. Thanks keith. What a treat this is. 

The beer poured a clear golden color with a thin but bubbly white head that stuck around for a bit. There was nice fruity (based on the pluots that are aged in this) aroma and some funky earthy tones as well. the taste is fruity up front, apricot maybe and tart throughout. This is another fine example of a wild ale from RR and I cant see anything wrong with this one. There is a lingering fruit taste that runs around the mouth and sticks on the tongue and some peppery notes that are mixed in as well. I think the plummy taste at the end is a nice finish to this fine beer. I really wish this made it to bottles but this sampling will do me for now.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, LUXEMBOURG","ggaughan"

It poured a really clear light amber, which makes me think perhaps this would be better from closer to the bottom of the keg.  Compared with the Supplication, this was was lighter in body, more sour, a little less bretty, and kind of chewier.  It might be asking too much of the beer for it to carry a stronger pluot influence, but from what I remember that was a dull, boring fruit.  Nevertheless, a nicely made, refreshing brew, kind of interesting, but I’d like to see more residual sweetness from the fruit.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

How: Tap at Dark-Lord-Day 2008
The look: Cloudy peach color body with a long lasting medium white head
In long: Nose is barnyard wild, very wild.  As funky as the funkiest lambics.  Less bretty but more tasty/intense as their Sanctification.  As expected the taste is sour, acidic and tart as hell but never falling into the vinegary or lemon extract territory.  This is tasty acidity and sourness.  Moderately fruity although not specific fruits were coming out.  Might be the pluots they use since I dont know what they taste like (didnt even know such a thing existed).  Then comes the finish, dry and acidic like the most hardcore gueuzes (Cantillon or Hanssens on a good day).  Despite its intensity the beer never cease to be refreshing and highly drinkable.  This beer to me blends the best of what an intense Sour Ale and an intense Lambic Gueuze have to offer.

Seems to ring of a tinny honey presence at times, mostly landing on a firm resonance of apricot, plum, pineapple, guava and extended juicy fruitiness.  Dries out a little, before blossoming in full furious acidity; tanginess of musty vinaigrette and pepperiness.

3137,"2008-04-15",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2009 Growler carefully hauled back from California by Kens better half.  Straw colored clear body from a first careful pour sits underneath a medium to large bubbled white head.  Instant acidic nose of cider vinegar, honey, straw, and mild dried peach and apricot skin/rind.  Theres a tremendously high level of acidity in this beer, sharp and vinegar-like, like a Flemish red, but without the typical cherry/cedar/nut Flemish red flavors.  Its prickly, bright, corrosive, assertive and then it shows its fruity side - dried peach skin, sweet and oily apricot and fruit cocktail juice, but then thats once again destroyed in the next sip by a stinging acidity, and its really nice how both of these qualities, the acidity and the sweet fruit, stay nearly completely separate.  Its like drinking two beers one after another.  Overall its a very, very nice beer, well-made and flawless in execution, if not the most deep or complex Belgian blonde/golden recipe used as a base, but the plouts certainly help.  The sourness and acidity, though, is spectacularly executed.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Medium-to-full mouthfeel: loads of tart, zesty grapefruit and citrus rind and apricot; gorgeous fruit character at the core of things, not overshadowed by the tart, funky edges; solid levels of carbonation, clenching tartness, biting acidity, and surprisingly developed funk and brett.

3137,"2008-03-14",3.6,"Beautiful in the glass- sparling light golden with a small white head. One of the most sour beers Ive ever had. Rewarding and challenging. Mild citric sour fruits on acetic acid. More punishing as it warms and loses effervescence. Tastes a tad bit of salt or mineral. Delicious but one dimensional and extreme.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
3137,"2008-03-07",4.1,"growler on behalf of amorphiss (thanks peter!)..... poured a cloudy light orange brown with a significant  soapy white head.... welcoming nose of tart and sour fruitiness but the fruits were difficult to pinpoint.  perhaps some citrus and some very subtle apricot comes to mind..... flavors continued on a similar path which was fine by me.  tart, sour fruit, apricot or peaches which remained completely refreshing and easily drinkable.  mouthfeel was fairly spritzy and alive.... a pricey growler to say the least but well worth it.  i hope to have this again one day.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

Very dry.","Concord, California, USA","ChillCoat"

3137,"2008-02-21",4.0,"Had on tap at the brewery 02/20/2008.  Served slightly hazy, with potent sour nose.  At first taste, the tart came on much more than batch 1.  The fruit is much more present in this batch (#2) than the former.  Mild carbonation & served very cold.  As this sour warmed the flavors became much more pronounced.

Very dry and digestible.  The sour & tart lingered well.  

Overall another wonderful barrel aged sour from Russian River.","Sonoma, California, USA","bumpskier"

Shared this cool day very mellow day with bikesandbeer, wetherel, westsidethreat, padrefan, fordest, denverlogan and many others.  Pours Yewllow gold with a 1 finger bright white head.  Nose is sour, woody and very funky.  The taste is vinous with a big sour punch, and also nicely balanced and sweet.  This was really pretty damn awesome, probably second favorite of the day.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
3137,"2007-07-23",4.0,"Sampled on tap at the First Annual Stone Sour Fest, July 2007
This beer has a hazy, copper-gold tint to it and it is topped by a wispy, barely there, white head.  Green fruit aromatics greet my nostrils as I take my first draught of the aroma; I get flavors of star fruit, not-quite ripe honeydew or perhaps it is a not-ripe cantaloupe aroma.  The plum notes become quite noticeable as I dig around in the nose.  Actually the fruit character really starts to open up after a little bit; Pluots indeed.  I cant seem to shake a sharp, green note here though; perhaps it is contributed by the sour bugs.  At times I actually get some notes reminiscent of sweet cherry skins; it is fleeting, but when noticed adds a really nice note to the aroma.

Upfront this beer tastes crisp, tart and dry; it really hits that quaffable character that I like in sour beer.  There is a noticeable green fruit note here as well as a touch of vegetal character in the background.  The dominant note is a tartness, but I really think (at least it seems so) that the pluots contribute a roundness & extra complexity to the sour notes that are in this beer.  As I expected, the fruit character is much more apparent in the nose (which is typical of softer fruits like apricots, peaches and plums).  When my palate gets used to the initial flavors, I am able to pick out notes of sourdough (a mix of the funk and some malt notes) at times as well as a grassy grain flavor.  Lactic acid is the most apparent acidic quality here, but like I said, there is a persistent, fruity acidity here that is really quite nice.

While the beer is light, it is not austere or bony, there is some body here, which seams wrapped up in the fruit presence / contribution.  This is quite complex, though it is not necessarily on the surface and you do have to work at it.  I find that I am starting to take Vinnies artistry for granted; this beer is so well integrated, so well made.  I almost dont think about it, b/c despite this being perhaps the most balanced, multi-layered, eminently crafted beer at the festival, I almost felt like it was overlooked.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3137,"2007-05-11",4.1,"Draft at the brewpub. 5/7/07. Clear golden amber color, with a thin white head. 
Funky, sour wild ale aroma, with some sweetness from the fruit. The sourness of the beer is nicely accentuated by a sweet apricot flavor up front. I noticed plum in the finish, along with a bit of pepper. Ive never tasted a plucot before (actually never heard of the fruit before this beer was brewed), but it matches really nice with the sour character of this beer.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"

3137,"2007-04-27",3.7,"On tap at Toronado. This dark blonde ale poured with a miniscule off-white head. The sour acidic pluot flavor is comparable to some of the better Belgian fruit lambics, and the barrell aging has made the overall taste pleasantly subtle.

Had a nice golden color, much like temptation with a white head, light carbonation.  The aroma was awesome, very sour with vinous and oaken notes, also very fruity.  The flavors were really great, like an unripened apricot mixed with oak and white wine.
