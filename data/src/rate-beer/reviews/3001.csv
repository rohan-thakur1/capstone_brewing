3001,"2012-11-24",2.6,"City Slicker is probably the smoothest malt liquor around. It could pass for an American lager with no hop character. Its not bad, but be aware its significantly lighter than most malt liquors and will not get you from point A to B as fast.","Virginia, USA","Shanebrews"
3001,"2005-07-15",0.9,"Pale yellow color with no head.  Aroma of spoiled sugar.  Tasted like moldy sweet corn.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
3001,"2005-06-19",1.5,"word.  drinkin this was almost as good as watching shag chug most of his after we sang to him.  this was a good beer weekend","Marietta, Ohio, USA","LilKem"
3001,"2005-06-18",1.6,"This smells like shit. No really it does. The taste is rather smooth but it has some sort of paper thing going on with a bunch of corn. Its ok one of the easier malt liquors to drink.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
3001,"2004-12-31",1.1,"Sweet Aroma.  Sweet Grains  Much Better Then I was Expecting.  Sweetness Seems to Cover Up any Skunky-ness...or Most anyways. a Thumb Up to Wisconsin for Making a Swill Beer That Was Better Then it Was Expected to be.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
3001,"2004-08-06",1.8,"Picked this up in a liquor store in Superior, Wisconsin. The mullets behind the counter were probably wondering what this yuppie was doing buying a 24 oz malt liquor! Slick name for a malt liquor - no macho animal names for this beast. Wonder who the target market is for this one? Hard to tell with the pimp hat wearing mo-fo standing on the street corner. Has a light golden-yellow appearance with a soapy, slightly thick white head. Wet cardboard aroma with some funky malt byproduct smell in the back end. Sweet, sticky flavor, with a lot of adjuncts - think I saw a kernel of corn floating around in there. Has some bland fruitiness in there as well. If you close your eyes, it almost tastes like watered sown orange koolaid. Does City make a decent beer?","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
3001,"2004-07-01",3.0,"Ahhhh yes. Malt liquor. When one thinks of malt liquor they tend to think of 40s in a brown bag. Hangin out of the street corner and sellin some crack. Or perhaps some poor college student looking for a cheap buz.  City Slicker is king of malt liquor. This beer is what all malt liquors should be like. It has a sweet corn aroma and taste, with a gentle hint of mildew. It comes in a large bottle and it will kick you in the ass. Billy Dee only wishes he drank City Slicker.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","Yankovitch333"
3001,"2004-06-11",1.7,"Light straw color with a diminishing fizzy white head. Cookie dough and light flower aromas. Almost too sweet and perfumy.  Flavors are lightly sweet and again rather flowery. No real malt flavors. Alcohol does not seem to be as overbearing in this malt liquor as in others of its ilk. But the lack of malt disappoints. Rather dry and meaningless finish. Had the choice between the 24 oz. can and the 40 oz. bottle. 24 ounces of this is more than enough to slake any ones thirst.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
3001,"2004-05-25",3.8,"Im going to save half of this brew for Thursday night for sure.My personal experience with these shows that ice cold is the only way to sample them,so icey it is.Nice golden color,small white head that faded fast but left a little foam behind.The aroma is malty and citrus (lemon) with a slight corn appearance,mildly sweet as well.It actually has a very nice flavor in the beginning.Malty sweet and fruity with a mild hop presence,with it getting a little bitter in the middle but not too badly.The after taste is a little sweet and fruity,with the alcohol only coming on briefly at best.Its a little thin bodied but very nicely done and definately a brew that can be taken out of the paper bag.Thanks to GrainbeltGuzzler for sending me another nice brew.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
3001,"2004-03-22",3.7,"ONly malt that I have ever liked, Not available anywhere that I know of outside of la crosse though.  Tastes pretty good and gets you lit up","Goodhue, Minnesota, USA","GrainBeltGuzzler"
3001,"2004-01-14",1.8,"UPDATED: OCT 7, 2004 I am not a big fan of malts. However, this is pretty good. Definitely has a corn flake flavor and some malty notes. I take back what I said before this has too much corn and alcohol burn. The finish is metallic like a rotten pear. Maybe it is because I had it in the can this time.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
3001,"2002-05-06",3.5,"Actually pretty smooth for a malt liquor.  Aroma isnt that great but the taste is supreme.","Lacrosse, Wisconsin, USA","Beerlover1982"
3001,"2002-04-30",2.2,"Couldnt resist this one.  I decided to drink this 2 ways, cold out of the forty, and at 50 degrees in a duvel tulip. From the bottle cold, this beer is not objectionable.  Clean malt flavor, showns some corn sugar after a while.  Some hops present, but mostly in the background.  At 50+ degrees out a duvel tulip, this beer shows many more flaws.  Nice head, dare I say belgian lace?  Sweatsock aroma is persistent.  Smeels and tastes of corn sugar.  It has the smell I associated with beer when I was underage and beginning to drink.  Some fusels and faint hops.  Out of the forty itself, I would give it about a 2.5/5, but I will rate it as an average of the duvel tulip/40 bottle ratings.  Although, if I am ever in need of malt liquor, this will be my first stop.  This baby packs a punch.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"

3001,"2001-09-10",2.5,"This is the most interesting forty I have had becuase it was from a small wisconsin brewery i had never heard of. 40s usually come from big time breweries. There were still able to capture the very distinct cheap 40 malt liqour taste. Average, tasted similar to colt 45.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
