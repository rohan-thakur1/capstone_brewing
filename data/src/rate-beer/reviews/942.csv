942,"2017-03-06",3.3,"Can. Pours a clear dark gold body with a one finger foamy beige head. The nose is mostly toasty malt with a slight hint of caramel sweetness. The flavor is toasted malt, a slightly higher than expected level of leafy hoppiness, and some lingering husky cereal grain. Light bodied with fizzy carbonation and a lingering husky finish. Not a bad effort, but not quite up to Anchor standards.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
