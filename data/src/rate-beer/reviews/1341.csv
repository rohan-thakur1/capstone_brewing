The taste is clean and light with a sweet light molasses-like maltiness, a touch of peat, a touch of raisin, and an oddly dry dusty finish. Its just not assertive enough, nor big enough.

Medium sweet caramels with some vanilla, a slight graininess, light chocolate, and light toastiness up front before a light earth and a touch of roast comes in to balance. Light vanilla stays with the caramel through the end where this finishes smooth, clean, and somewhat dry with a light bitterness and balanced sweetness. Fairly lengthy aftertaste following a medium, smooth body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, not a great beer, but really nice in comparison to some of their others.

My final of four samples was a very robust and well executed scottish ale. Of the set this is the one that I would have ordered a full pint of given more time to linger. Flavorful, rich, and chewy it has everything you want in the style without trying to be too much.

Aroma / Appearance - The chocolate brownish / red body was the color of Dr Pepper with only hints of carbonation. A vanilla head lined the top like felt inside a glove. The smell was like a cherry twizzler dipped in chocolate and then placed over a toasted crust of bread. Sweet and heavy it had a nice dessert like texture.

Flavor / Palate - Doughy chocolate simmers on the tongue. Breaded and warm it tastes like it was topped with cherry jam. The texture is thick and heavy yet not cloying. Rich on the tongue and throat this is a solid robust beer. Id enjoy this if I were ever in the area again.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1341,"2006-01-17",3.4,"Draught at Boscos, Squared.  Beer had a full-bodied mouthfeel (though Ive had thicker with similar taste characteristics) with flavors of chocolate.  Had a delicious aroma, with a light brown body.  Head was minimal.  Flavor lingered in mouth (just a touch too long, I might add.)  Will have again.","Franklin, Tennessee, USA","ATOmemphis"
1341,"2005-12-17",2.9,"Draught @ the brewpub. Pours a clear, dark mahogany with white head. The aroma is grassy hops and faint malt. The flavor leans more toward citrusy hops than the malt. This needs to be a bit richer to be a good Scottish ale. Still drinkable, but mediocre.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"
1341,"2005-11-22",2.9,"This is an overly carbonated version of Boscos London Porter.  Smells of sweet soy sauce and tastes sweeter, but much more carbonated.","Covington, Louisiana, USA","punkeedo"
1341,"2005-10-09",3.0,"Had this in Nashville.  A shade too light and two shades too bitter.  Nonetheless, it was still good.","Lenox, Massachusetts, USA","KariCupcake"
1341,"2005-10-08",3.2,"On tap in Nashville.  Super dark brown color.  Big bitter chocolate flavor with a barley-ness hidden in there somewhere.","Portland, Oregon, USA","ericnixon"
1341,"2005-10-08",2.7,"Well over-rated, as of this writing. Glowing rootbeer red-brown.  Tart, fruity, ale aroma.  Like watery cought syrup.  Dilute and thing.  Sugary, boozy finish.  Needs more peat, leather, ale yeast and oomph in general.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"
1341,"2005-09-12",3.4,"Draft at Nashville location: Deep brown color with a tan head. Nice malty smells with a milk chocolate, roasted nuts, and caramel taste. Medium bodied with a creamy texture. One of my favorites from Boscos.","Huntsville, Alabama, USA","BeerHawk"
1341,"2005-08-22",3.4,"Dark chestnut brown.  Flavor is loaded with caramel malts and lots of smoky sweetness.  Bitter and dry in the finish.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","desurfer"
1341,"2005-08-18",3.6,"From brewpub sampler.  Deep copper, decent head.  Gentle malt nose.  Good flavors, but lacked depth.  Smoke and caramel.  A bit more body and this could have been really great.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
1341,"2005-06-13",3.5,"Light to medium body.  I can taste caramel, chocolate, and coffee.  Its a pretty good brew.  I can tell theres some complexity in the malt character.  Pretty good overall.","Arkansas, USA","ericmc83"
1341,"2005-05-19",3.8,"Bottle conditioned (22 oz. bomber); Shaker glass, Nashville Brewpub.  Barely hazy deep amber in the glass; off-gray head with nice lacing.  Light to medium bodied.  This seemed to me like a Scottish porter more  than a Scottish ale, but Im not a stickler for style when it tastes like this.  Chocolately and bready malt with good bitter hops on the finish.  Some caramel and roast on the finish too.  Peaty and woody in the middle.  Smells malty and bready.  Very well balanced.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"
1341,"2005-02-04",3.7,"Pours dark brown with mahoganey hints and tan frothy head. Tthin spotty lacing.  Dark roasted malt flavor with hop nose. Ddark roasted malt flavor with hop and vanilla notes.  Full-bodied.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
1341,"2005-01-10",3.7,"Nashville. Faint to no aroma. Very dark mahogany in color. Average sized, off-white head. Beautiful lace. Very sweet, maly and somewhat cloying, but not bad. Very nice flavor.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
1341,"2004-12-07",4.3,"Wonderful, rich flavor.  Lots of malt with just enough hops to balance flavor.  Does not taste high in alcohol, but do not be fooled, get somene else to drive if you drink more than 2.","USA","dragonjeep"
1341,"2004-11-04",4.3,"I have a friend that has told me that this  was the only beer that has ever given him an out of body experience. I can see why! Malty aroma with inviting alochol. Beautiful garnet color. Malty, roasty, a hint of noble hops. Warming alcohol in the flavor and palate. It would be easy to drink enough pints of this beer to have an out of body experience.","USA","Jray"
1341,"2004-09-03",3.9,"-Aroma: Elegant nose full of roasted malt and hints of coffee
-Appearance: Deep brown with a nice, thick, tan head
-Flavor: Again with the roasted malts and coffee with hints of liquor that welcomingly warm the belly
-Palate: Nice and bitter, as a SA should be, with a hint of spiciness
-Overall Impression: I was a little aprhensive of this one when I saw it on the menu, simply because scottish ales tend to be a hit-or-miss and micros. However, I thought this one was spot on.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","MMM...Beer"
1341,"2004-07-27",3.5,"Dark brown with a good, lasting head. The aroma is sweet and malty with just a bit of peat. The same goes for the flavor, although the flavor is just a tad bit thin. I like my scottish ales to be a little richer. Theres a light bitterness in there as well. Tasty, but I enjoyed the porter much more.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

1341,"2004-02-24",3.9,"Draft. Ton of vanilla and banana esters mingled with heavy malt in aroma. Tasted rye and oak blended with vanilla in the body, along with some apple and grape. Not especially fruity though, the caramel malt and grain notes blended well. Quite a bit of hop flavor as well. Incredibly flavorful for 6% (wink, wink). Medium-bodied.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
1341,"2004-01-31",3.3,"Nice malty (roasty) character with a hint of vanilla present.  Sl. sweet initial taste gives way to a nice dry finish.  Appearance is nice as it has a tan mosly lasting head on top of a dark brown body.","Cordova, Tennessee, USA","kumite56"

1341,"2003-09-19",4.6,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2006 Bottle Conditioned in Memphis.  This beer is even better from a bottle.  The thickness of the beer and the yeast in the bottom of the bottle made for a fine dessert.","Memphis, Tennessee, USA","SmellGood"

1341,"2003-05-27",3.6,"From a sampler: Pours a dark reddish-brown color with a medium light tan head. Aroma is not as malty as you would expect given the fact that they use 7 different malts to make it. Medium body, the flavor is sweet up front with a more bitter back end. Finish is lightly hopped. Decent.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
