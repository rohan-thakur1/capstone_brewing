The beer pours a nice amber color with a white head. The aroma is toffee with some earthy and grassy hops. The beer smells very well balanced. The flavor is a mix of sweet toffee and grassy hops with just a tad bit of bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice Vienna lager.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
