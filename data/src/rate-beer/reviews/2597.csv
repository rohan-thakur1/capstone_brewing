Dark reddish-brown body; clear with a thin head that soon reduced to a ring. 

I had a typical reaction to this wild ale in that the aroma was a bit unappealing in some respects, but the BBL aging certainly improved this. The flavor was good, nicely complex and not too funky, with limited BBL effects A bit tart and lightly fruity, Near full bodied with light carbonation.

After sampling the original version a few years ago and knowing its origins selecting a sample for my flight required no waiting. Even with so many locals to try I knew I could not pass on the opportunity to revisit a top notch style that remains among my favorites regardless of how closely it does (or doesnt) resemble its ancestors from 100 years ago.

Aroma / Appearance - A deep brown body bubbles with traces of carbonation. The white head adds nice contrast and helps constrain the oak and caramel. Chocolate malts add a velvety smooth. The barrel aging remains present without being too overt about any particular brand being used for storage.

Flavor / Palate - Chocolate, oak, and velvet warm the palate. Melted pudding adds a layer that turns the experience into a filling dessert. Taking your average Kentucky Common and amping it up to 11, this beer manages to make the two things that I like most about the Bluegrass State. Now that I know Ill have to try to track it down again.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2597,"2014-08-19",3.6,"Tap @ Local Option: The darkest brown body you can imagine, without actually being black. Beige & khaki bubbly collar on top. Aroma of sweet & lightly musty oak, moderately acetic cherry skins, sour lacto bacteria, a small touch of warming bourbon, faint roast, & a notable base of toasted, caramel-type maltiness upon which everything else is structured. Up front smack of tartness on the palate; cherry, lemony, & lacto induced with a solid slathering of wet wood & must. Notes of sweet-tarts fade into a more mellow semi-sweet & semi-warming finish with small hints of bourbon, toasted malt, nuts, faint vanilla, & more dampening oak. Didnt know what to expect from this one, but I was pleasantly surprised. Reminded me of a slightly lighter (in both heft & malt depth) version of Tart of Darkness.

2597,"2014-05-31",4.0,"Draught at Local Option, 4/18/14Deep amber-auburn colored beer with darker mahogany shades. Clarity is high while the beige head is small and shows moderate retention.Clean, sweet maltiness coupled with the spicier, more aromatic side of bourbon. Not just a shot of boozey, raw, grainy bourbon but nicely integrated with the beer, producing cherry-like fruitiness, light chocolate and tons of soft caramel. I get very little booziness on the end and just a touch of the expected vanilla. Medium strength of aroma.The flavor is is full of medium-sweet caramel malt, tons of fruitiness and soft, spicy bourbon. Add to this a wonderfully invigorating texture (tight carbonation, soft, supple maltiness) and its just incredibly drinkable and lacking on the booze or grainy astringency often found in these beers. Furthermore, while the bourbon flavor is certainly quite present, it dosent completely take over the beer. Good wood and malt complexities and a lingering bourbon and fruit finish. Close with Morning Wood for my favorite beer I had at Local Option. Interesting that the ratings of this are all over the place.  I guess everyone calls it tart, where I just saw a nice, balancing, fruitiy acidity.  I guess that may be a bit off-putting to those just looking for a straightforward bourbon-aged stout-like beer, which this is certainly not.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Aroma is like sourish dirt and earth - light cocoa with cherry acetic and muddy earhty malts.  Its a light aroma mostly dominated by the acetic cherry character (not nail polish).  That continues in the flavor with a dominant sour cherry that thins out the body.  It overwhelms any other elements and is just thin sour juice.  If this had some more body with some other flavor to balance the sour than it would be fantastic.  As it warms some light bourbon aspects emerge and there is a bit of a smoked character.

So, on draft at Jerrys along with the regular Kentucky Common.  The flavors seem brighter than with the regular version.  Maybe the whiskey accentuates the flavor, or maybe it was just my imagination but I tried them minutes apart.  Dark mahogany with modest tan head / Rich nose of roast coffee and chocolate / Light to medium body, moderately tart with just a hint of sugar, and excellent balance and dry finish / Deep, sharp flavors of bittersweet chocolate, dark roast coffee, hazelnuts, and rye whiskey, with notes of oatmeal and caramel / An elegant, chocolately, sour; but, not really fair to compare this to a Belgian sour since this is not made with brettanomyces.  Spoke to the brewer and he thought this beer would be better classified as a ""traditional ale"", and I agree although, appreciated on its own merits, its a pretty fine sour.  Would love to see more of this style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jstraw"
