Funkiness on the nose with a clear tart cherry note picked up as well. Tart, sour, funky, fruity and really comes across like a good Belgian Kriek sour but with a nod towards a Flemish brown, the Burgundy ageing shows the woodiness reveals other facets here a hint of dark sugar (but just a hint) which just tempers the sourness ever so slightly from being too extreme. The carbonation is great its lovely and soft in the mouth but does lead to a few belches. I start off by sipping this but soon I am gulping it, the sour tartness of the cherries and the barrel ageing have worked a treat here, this is lovely stuff. Its not a cheap beer at £10.95 but its pleasing to see Thornbridge having a crack at something like this. It is a bloody good beer and for me a real return to form for Thornbridge.
