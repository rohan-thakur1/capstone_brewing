4241,"2017-06-20",3.5,"Lorsque Buxton et Lervig collaborent ça donne naissance à Trolltunga, une bière au style Gooseberry Sour IPA, du trois en un pour un maximum de saveurs. A lorigine, le mot trolltunga signifie la langue du troll et représente une proéminence de falaise située à plusieurs centaines de mètres au dessus dun lac en Norvège, ce qui permet de bien comprendre la subtilité de létiquette. Cette bière est une déclaration damour aux espaces de nature adorés par les brasseurs. Trolltunga, cest une robe jaune et brumeuse avec une légère mousse blanche dégageant des arômes de citron, de houblon et de groseilles. En bouche, on y retrouve des saveurs dherbes, de citron, de pamplemousse, dépices, de pin et de houblon dans un ensemble amer et acidulé.

Theres some saltiness hovering somewhere in the background, playing 3rd or 4th violin, next to the mild hops bitterness.

The beer feels refreshing as it strikes an excellent balance between upfront sourness and long lasting aroma of berries and citrus juice.

Despite a crowded and well curated draft list at Holy Grale ordering a half pour of Trolltunga was a no brainer. With Buxtons reputation for sours and a price point not much above a 12 ounce bottle I jumped at the chance. You should do the same as well.

Aroma / Appearance - A rose gold body shimmers with a sassy tropical spirit not native to either the UK or Norway. Wheat, pineapples, and light tartness brighten the mood. Focused and sharp, it cuts through the air like a knife.

Flavor / Palate - Pineapple, mango, and semisweet dessert wine tickles the tongue. Rather than the abrasive raw nature of a pure sour this delicately toes the line of dry and tart. The acidity does not truly emerge until a few seconds after a sip. If you are looking for a new experience then get a bottle or find it on tap.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

I cant really get anything else from this, the gooseberry is overwhelming... and in a very good way. As it warms, it gives off notes of maybe passionfruit. Tastes as wonderful, unripe gooseberry tartness mostly. The tartness is not too much though, far from acidic and burning.

4241,"2015-12-09",3.4,"Bottle. Nose is goseberry, lime, hint of tropical, and yeast. Im vary wary of Buxtons recent use of yeast which has smelled horrific, and this is not unpleasant but is still not quite right. 

Taste is strong goseberry, lime, pineapple, tart lemon, faint pine note, and a hint of Lilt (or at least my 20 year old memory of Lilt) 

Its a reasonable beer, but its one of many sour beers, and in a saturated market its hard to get excited about it; there are tens of decent fruity sour beers.","Greater Manchester, ENGLAND","Hanoi"
