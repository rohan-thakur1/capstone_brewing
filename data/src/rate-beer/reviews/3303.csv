3303,"2014-09-28",3.6,"From a gravity wood barrel at Macche in Rome, opened and poured directly by Manuele. This beer pours amber colour with a nice and consistent white foam. The aroma are thin bready malts and a pleasant hoppiness. The beer stays dry in the mouth, balanced and with the consistence of bread. Nice lager!","Rome, ITALY","ippopotamo36"
3303,"2014-08-26",3.7,"Gravity barrel pour at a small festival outside the brewpub in August, 2014: Murky golden orange (glass-tested, considerably lighter than what the profile picture illustrates). Creamy and persistent white foam. Clean and bright aroma of dusty yeast, peach jam-filled cookies, new mown hay, herbal hops, lemon candy, and a hint of marmalade. Soft and fine carbonation. Dry, lean and toasty yet well textured with rich hay-dust pils malt. Sparkling hop notes supplement the very clean body with a lemon oil purity. Sweet, toasty and cookielike Munich is accentuated by a surge of lemony-herbal Spalt-derived sharpness. Excellent depth and fullness due to the exquisitely extracted malt, and the ensuing medley of vibrant apricot and orangey fruitiness is also welcomed. Malt is quite edgeless throughout, but gets nicely coarsened by a rustic tinge of sulfury yeast and scratchy minerals. Fresh-picked hop oil character teems with luster. Finishes well-attenuated yet succulently cookie- and toasted bread-like, with a sealing punch of coarse Spalt. A very soulful and cohesive kellerbier with that telltale Franconian charm.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3303,"2014-07-20",3.6,"Gravity pour at the brewery. Aroma is really grainy, neutral, light earthy notes, nutty aromas, toasted malt - cleanest kellerbier yet, but not necessarily in a good way, lacks a bit of character, pretty neutral. Taste is grainy, herbal tea-like flavors. Light-medium body with medium carbonation. Easy drinking.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

3303,"2013-05-25",3.6,"On tap at the brewery in Geisfeld.  Its golden, cold and quite hoppy and very decent.  Pretty hoppy in fact, some toffee.  Good.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
3303,"2012-08-18",3.6,"On tap at the brewery Gasthof, 19 July 2012. Amber coloured with a decent, off-white head. Aroma of tartish hedgerow fruit, a hint of chocolate powder and leafy hops. Flavour was malty, with more fruit, a touch of yeasty and flinty edge, leading to a soft finish. Very drinkable and a bargain at less than 2 euros.","Bristol, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","downender"
3303,"2011-08-01",3.6,"My Bottom Line :  
Herbal, spicy hops surround bready malts and their subtle toastiness before taking this rustic lager into surprisingly bitter territories. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam tops the krug, which later reveals an amber-hued brew. 
-The aroma is not bold enough to match the poignant hop finish.
-Light caramelization is not necessarily harmonious with the hop signature. 
-An earthy touch appears in the beautifully hoppy finish.

On tap at the brewery gasthof.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
3303,"2011-05-18",2.9,"Wenig herber Antrunk, absolut mild. Der Hopfen ist absolut verwässert, ersetzt sich zum Mittelteil ein. Wenig nussig, aufgrund der Wässrigkeit legit sich dies recht schnell. Wegen der vorherrschenden Milde eher langweilig, die Würzigkeit gibt zu wenig herb, obwohl die Grundtöne vielversprechend sind.

3303,"2009-09-02",3.8,"Ceramic mug.  Airy head.  Orangey-brown colour.  Minerally, hoppy nose.  Hoppy and minerally but with more dark malt than comparably hoppy Franconian country beers.

3303,"2009-08-17",4.0,"Draft @ brewpub. Copper color beer with rocky beige head. Aroma is mellow Frankenbier with lots of bready malt. Palate is clean, dry, smooth and quaffable. Low carbo. Fruity entry in the flavors and an excellent brisk hoppy finish. Tastes much hoppier than it smells. Bright and earthy, bready and hoppy all at same time. Incredibly balanced and delicious.

3303,"2008-06-05",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 19, 2015 Single hop Spalt tradition Lagerbier, the same wonderful hop strain featured in the Knoblach Unges.

June 2008: Gravity pour at the brewery in Geisfeld on the patio. Nose of  wort, caramel, toffee, grains.   Grassy, wet, green noble hop character, moderately bitter well-matched with sugar.  Bright and clean and honey-ish.

From gravity barrel at the town festival on August 15 2014.. Turbid honey orange body with a short white head.
Hop impression is more mandarin orange than grass. Juicy and sweet, malty and yeasty, a little bit too turbid and chalky in the mouth, but the brewers themselves are carting around the little firkins.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
