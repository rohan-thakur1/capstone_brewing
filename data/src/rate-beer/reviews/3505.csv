3505,"2017-02-16",3.4,"Gravity at The Derby Winter Beer Festival. A copper brown colour with a frothy off white head. Aroma of chocolate, caramel, some nuts, slight coffee, a little burnt sugar and subtle dark fruits. Taste of chocolate, caramel, some nuts, slight coffee, a little dark fruits, a hint of vanilla and subtle cookie dough. Light bodied and soft carbonation.

3505,"2009-07-18",3.8,"Handpulled cask at the Pembury Tavern on 15th July 2009, during beer festival. Deep brown-black with a small cream-coloured head. For such a low strength this mild was bursting with flavour. A sharp scent of roasted malts are in the forefront with strong coffee and chocolate notes abounding. A little sophisticated smoke too. First pint at the festival, and absolutely delicious.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","ladnewton"
3505,"2008-11-30",3.1,"[Gravity cask at Milton Keynes beerfest] Vicious foretaste of plums and coffee mellows into the usual dry, toasty mild, but the sour overtones of the plum keep hanging around.  Interesting, and good depth of flavour, but ultimately it didn’t work very well for me.","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","wheresthepath"

3505,"2008-06-04",3.2,"Cask at the Globe, Nottingham. I found this to be a pleasant but unremarkable mild with all the usual sort of aromas and flavours  roast, coffee, etc. It was a textbook case, but without any flair to make it stand out.","Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, ENGLAND","albertane"
3505,"2008-02-20",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2008 First pint at the highly anticipated Merton Winter Festival. Rich chocolate brown, big soapy tan head that lingers attractively. Deep toast aroma, as if one made a concentrate, a reduction sauce, of toast. Nice chocolate accent. Simple, gently sour roast flavor. Just enough body to keep it from feeling unsubstantial, but still a deeply refreshing beer. (If daily gallons of beer like this were still one of the perks of being a miner, perhaps wed still have more mines.) Cracking good mild, and a fine way to start the festival.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"

3505,"2007-05-29",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2008 Cask conditioned at the Alexandra Arms, Kettering, Northants, 25-05-07. Poured black with very little head. This was stunning, the aroma was nice and roasty with maybe a touch of woodiness and these key characteristics carried on through into the taste which finished with a nice smoothness, it was simplicity itself but wonderful for it. This beer should really be put up as a benchmark for how a good English Mild should be. There are some great Milds around with Potbelly Beijing Black being one of most memorable of recent years, but it is rare that Ive stumbled across a new mild at the more usual low abv that has had such an impact on me, simply superb.    Updated again at Merton Winter Beer Fesatival Feb 08   This little mild still tastes great, and as Milds go it sets quite a high benchmark, but it isnt quite the force that it was last time out so Im going to have to knock it don a point or two.","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"
