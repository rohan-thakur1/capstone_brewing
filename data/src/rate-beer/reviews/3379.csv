3379,"2017-03-19",4.1,"Tallboy can from Flanagans Appleton. Hazy copper, large foamy off-white head, good retention. Aroma of grainy malt, lemon, a bit of pine. The taste is pine, lemon, tea, earth, pale malt. Medium bodied, refreshing, a bit different. Nice!","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
3379,"2017-03-02",4.8,"This is by far the best session IPA I have had. The manage to keep the abv below 5% but still produce a robust and very hoppy IPA. This is an all-day drinking beer.","Wisconsin, USA","grumpa"
3379,"2017-03-01",5.0,"This is a refreshing brew that finishes with such a smooth finish. They sell this stuff in Lambeau so I mean, there is no competition.","De Pere, Wisconsin, USA","DudeBro1630"
3379,"2017-03-01",5.0,"Now this is what I call a session IPA! Full flavor despite coming in at a 4.8% abv. Nose of freshly cut grass mixed with citrus. bold, hoppy, citrusy taste. well balanced and not too bitter. A wonderful orange/amber hue. Complex in flavor, and just a wonderfully easy drinking IPA that wont knock you out.","Green Bay, Alabama, USA","tmj399"
3379,"2017-02-28",4.7,"I am consistently disappointed by Session IPAs however green chop is a Session that drinks above and beyond the watery trend of most. Nose on this beer is straight dank mango and some tropical notes. Malty but subtle enough to have a few. Appeasing bitterness.","USA","DrThunder"
3379,"2016-07-24",3.6,"Aroma of pine and citrus to start off with, pours clear amber with a full light tan head. Nice clean pine hop notes in the flavor, going to a crisp bitterness. Light bodied, and easy drinking. A nice Session IPA.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"
3379,"2016-04-06",3.6,"16 oz. can, consumed on 4-1-16. Dry, hops-dominated aroma features scents of caramel, bran muffin, and dry biscuit. Pleasant smell. Pours a surprisingly dark amber. Clear liquid, although there is haze in the final pour. Moderate amount of beige head. Beautiful color of both liquid and head. Mild to moderate effervescence. Long-lasting head. Good lacing. Really good looking. Earns a rare 5 for appearance from me. One of the best-looking beers Ive seen in a long time. Nice, dry, bitter flavor matches the aroma. Dry biscuit. Uni-dimensional in flavor, but thats the purpose of the style, and it works really well in that dimension. Light to medium body. Easy to drink. Smooth in the palate and adequately lively. Overall, a very good beer for the style and looks fantastic. I would describe it a s a red session IPA. A pleasant surprise.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

3379,"2015-07-25",3.5,"473ml can. Super dank in the nose, flavor is tropical dankiness, some persimmon/guava.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
3379,"2015-06-19",3.6,"clear copper with a fairly thick beige head. Aroma is a beautiful floral citrus. Resinous mouth feel. Taste is hoppy citrus. Not the best tasting IPA Ive ever had, but the aroma when taking a sip really pulls it through. I agree with arkurzynski. I lean toward it being more of a straight IPA than Session.  But that doesnt mean I dont like it.  I like it.","Brillion, Wisconsin, USA","BeerInHeaven"
3379,"2015-05-07",3.4,"16oz can shared. Medo orange color with white head. Mild lacing. The aroma is a burst of grapefruit. The flavor is decent enough for a session nice hop flavor mild to medium malt base. Mild bitterness flavor.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","tmongoose"
3379,"2015-04-11",3.2,"Deep copper. Nose of citrus and caramel candy. Flavor is caramel and lemon citrus. Dank. Syrupy. Not overally sessionable, but okay.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
