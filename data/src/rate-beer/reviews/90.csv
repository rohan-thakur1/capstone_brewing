90,"2016-10-02",3.4,"Bottle: &nbsp Soft cocoa, maple syrup, and some chiles on the tongue. &nbsp It has a chile aspect but not the heat. &nbsp Fairly sweet. &nbsp Pretty tasty overall. &nbsp Its weird, I keep expecting heat because of the chile flavor, but it doesnt show up. &nbsp Moderate body and mouthfeel. &nbsp Interesting sweet beer. &nbsp Cocoa powder, maple syrup and chile flavor is what I seem to get most, but no heat. &nbsp Very interesting beer to say the least. &nbsp Thanks Bill!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"

90,"2015-03-01",3.9,"HMOG 2015. At the tail end of a crazy day, this one managed to awanken the palate. Timing and placing perfection for me. Vanille, coffee, cocoa on top of a lively golden brew. Heavy sweet competed nicely with the 30 other brews I had.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"

Lots of vanilla and chocolate. Some roasty malt. Syrupy and molasses. Ok bit a little too much on the sweet stuff.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
90,"2014-08-28",4.1,"Only complaint is that its a bit too boozy/too much alcohol heat. Otherwise, this is wonderful. Love the flavors. Seems like it should be a porter/stout, but its not -- rather, very good flavors, including  chocolate, maple, vanilla, and some other things going on. Quite good!","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","mikedR"
90,"2014-08-10",3.4,"UPDATED: AUG 11, 2014 Bottle: Thanks, Jason. Light copper body, slightly murky with a white-ish head that fades to a collar quickly. Aroma of caramel, light maple syrup, honey, faint metallic toffee, just a hint of cocoa dust, some toasted crackers, & faint yeast. Taste has more vanilla & tastes like some sort of wafer cookie. Lightly sweep marscarpone & whipped cream sweetness with hints of maple, brown sugar, toffee, Werthers candy, butterscotch, vanilla bean, & very faint coffee grounds. Lots of stuff going on, a dry bread & yeast finish. A very unique beer here. Lots to wrap your head around, but pretty tasty when all is said & done.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Bottle: The aroma consists of chocolate, light maple syrup, vanilla, and a hint of nuts. It pours a transparent copper with a small white head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a slightly thicker ring. The flavor starts with chocolate and caramel. He finish has light-moderate vanilla with a touch of nuts. Its medium bodied with light-moderate carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
90,"2014-06-13",3.9,"22 ounce bottle thanks to errl. A brunch golden ale? Interesting...poured into a brandy snifter. Pours a clear copper to burnt orange with a velvety head of beige foam. Pretty good retention. The aroma is definitely roasty and I get biscuit and syrup and honey. The taste delivers on the coffee while still delivering on the syrup aspects and bready notes that could be taken for pancakes. Thicker mouthfeel, a lot like I would expect in a stout. Moderate carbonation.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
90,"2014-06-08",3.5,"Pours hazy amber with frothy white head out of bottle. Aroma of caramel, spice, and malt. Taste of roasted cocoa, caramel, syrup, and malt. Good beer overall.

90,"2014-05-31",4.0,"On tap - deep rust color with a small head. Has a nice roast coffee aroma and a coffee and caramel taste. Seems like a stout but it isnt. Very nice. Not a huge herb/vegetable beer fan but I like this one.","Texas, USA","fiveacestx"
90,"2014-05-31",3.9,"Bottle thanks to rightcross55. Pours a hazy copper color with a small foamy head that fades to a nice ring. Very unique aroma. Jalapeno poppers, maple syrup, chocolate, vanilla pudding, coffee, and grease. Tastes like maple syrup and vanilla mostly. Also, getting caramel, coffee, and brown sugar. Very syrupy sweet. Medium to full body. Syrupy and sticky. Very unique beer all around. Either a breakfast or dessert beer I guess and I wish I wouldve opened this at a share. The strong sweetness and intense flavors will make it hard for me to finish the whole bomber. Very cool beer.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"

The aroma has a lot of cocoa and coconut notes, as well as a bit of maple. The flavor is very similar.

Aroma is cocoa nibs, chocolate, no presence of roasted malt so the chocolate notes and kinda like hot chocolate, molasses, caramel. Taste is huge cocoa powder, little bit of sweet maltiness in a good way. IT is actually pretty nice and interested and hides the alcohol really well.","Dallas, Texas, USA","Experiment_Ale"
