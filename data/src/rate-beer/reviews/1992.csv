1992,"2016-03-23",3.5,"From notes. Enjoyed this baby at a line share at Witchs Hat on St. Pattys Day. 500 mL was opened by the guy like 3 or 4 people in front of us that had horrific gas later in an enclosed hallway. The pour is a cola colored brown with a good amount of ruby shining through. There is a light tan head that isnt large to start, and fizzles down to a collar in short order. The aroma is incredibly hoppy right up front with a little nuttiness behind it. There is a light chocolate and a decent toasted malt, but the hops are pretty heavy. The flavor mimics it. There is a bitterness from the hop that lingers through the whole thing. There is a light chocolate and some roasty malts, but its pretty dominated by the hop. The mouth feel is lighter and carries a lighter carbonation. It just falls off the tongue quickly. The aftertaste is lingeringly bitter and carries a little nuttiness to go with the piney hop.

1992,"2016-02-03",3.9,"Draught at Armbsy, 1/30/16.God damn, Mr. Hill just doesnt put out bad beer. I absolutely detest most Black IPAs and Brown ales; probably my two least favorite styles (though barleywines are up there too). But just as I gave James a 3.9, despite not enjoying the beer, this one is right up there too, despite the same. Lighter than James, with more dark amber and chestnut showing through and with a beige head that is well-retained.A touch more toffee/caramel and raisin in the nose, but its very well balanced by citrusy and fruity hops, along with a touch of very light roast.Bitter, again, but not nearly as much as James (as expected) and with a bit more of a stickier, balancing malt presence. Crisp, dry and lean on the finish, the attenuation ultimately shows through and the hops win out, though toasted brown sugar, brown bread and light coffee persist as well. Fluffy and malty texture with perfect carbonation and no alcohol or flaws, as always. Shawn couldnt be more deserving of brewer of the year yet again and it would actually be a little ridiculous if he hadnt won. Or so I think.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Aroma: The aroma has a nice mix of pine hops, roasted malts, toffee, and caramel

Taste: Follows the nose, with a bitter hoppiness. Some floral flavor to the hops, but only just. Lots of roast, and some caramel. Finishes bitter with coffee.


Mouthfeel: A much more substantial body than I was expecting out of a brown ale, and it is very welcome. Velvety carbonation. 


Overall: Probably the first brown ale Ive ever enjoyed.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","cfrances33"

1992,"2012-12-05",3.7,"Bottle thanks to Fitz. Pours brown with a small off white head. Aroma is very simple, basic, some malt and doughiness, herbal and a touch piney and citric hop note. Flavor is much more sweet, strong malt character, bready and caramel before a stronger hop finish. Medium body and a sharp carbonation. Good for a style that Im not too big on.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","FunkyBrewster"
1992,"2012-11-27",3.6,"Flip top bottle courtesy of chouffe.  Well, it finally took one of my least favorite styles for me to be less than thrilled with a Hill Farmstead beer.  With that said, this is still a good beer and probably blows most Brown Ales out of the water.  The pour is a dark brown with some ruby red sneaking through and on top is a medium sized tan foam.  The aroma mixes chocolate, toasted grains, caramel, and mild soot.  The initial flavors are of bakers chocolate and sweet caramel, that give way to some roasted coffee, and finally, a bitter hoppy and dry finish.  Theres underlying nutty and vanilla notes throughout.  Carbonation is spot on and theres a pretty good firm body to this. This is really well crafted and I bet exactly what the master Shaun Hill was going for.  But in the end, its still a Brown Ale.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

1992,"2012-11-25",4.1,"On tap at the source.
Pours a solid dark brown, black color with a decent sized off white head that persists forever. Smells of caramel and chocolate malts a healthy shot of earthy citrus and pine to provide some balance. The flavor follows the aroma, sweet caramel, bread and chocolate maltiness with a solid shot of citrus and earthy hop flavor. Light hop bitterness provides nice balance. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a creamy grainy mouthfeel. This is a damn fine brown ale right here. Its tough to get a great brown ale because the style is a bit on the boring side, but this is an exceptional example.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"

Roasty chocolate aroma, with notes of marshmallows, graham crackers, a touch of earth, and grass. Taste is very roasty, dark chocolates, light spice, bread, pine, honey and a touch of maple syrup. Sticky mouth-coating body with medium-to-soft carbonation.  Definitely the best ""brown"" I have ever had but really more of a porter/light stout to me. Delicious, nonetheless, and another winner from Hill Farmstead.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"

On the palate its dialed in very nicely with a good balance between sweet chocolate notes and bitter fruity hops. Definitely a solid brown ale with all the notes coming in roasty and toasty and not burnt. Solid bitterness cleans up the finish...","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"

Flavour sort of blurs the line between a brown ale and black IPA, with lots of harsh roast, burnt espresso beans, a bit of soot, and moderate earthy hops. Far from being an amazing beer, Hill Farmstead managed to make a fucking boring style into something quite interesting with lots of body.

Palate : Nice soft and smooth bubbles.

Surprisingly char heavy (for the style) on the palate, but it blends well with notes of herbal hops, pale and chocolate malts, minerals, and more mocha. Fairly heavy bodied with a good roasted malt snap on the finish. Very enjoyable, especially for a style I typically dont give a lot of love to.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
1992,"2012-10-08",4.2,"My Bottom Line :  
Nut skins, earth and coffee greet leafy, wooden hops in this beautifully developed Brown Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam covers the dark brown.
-The mouthfeel is comfortable, not too sweet, but not exactly lean either.
-Malt flavors are so well developed, they make this beer memorable. Which is quite rare for a Brown Ale, a style a lot of breweries seem to dial in.
-These malt flavors are almost smoky at times as well.

1992,"2012-02-20",3.8,"In short: A rich nutty brown ale with a generous hopping.  Very good
How: Tap at the brewery and then tap at Black Back Pub, Waterbury VT
The look: Cloudy dark burgundy body topped by a small beige head with good retention
In long: Nose is has toasted raisin bread, resinous fruity and wooden hops.  Taste has plenty of walnuts, raisins, a bit of cacao, toasted brown bread, luscious caramel, light maple sensation and a whole lot of fruity and wooden hops with a resinous character.  Overall very creamy and full.  Obviously very hoppy (its Hill Farmstead) but this one is actually well balanced and doesnt feel like a darker nutty IPA.  It does feel like a brown ale, albeit a very hoppy one.  I liked it a lot.  Another beer I drank during my little Vermont pub crawl the day of the Birth of Tragedy & Daybreak release, there was a lot of beer drinking involved on that day but thankfully I have my wife for designated driver, so these Dont Drink and Drive ads may be successful at preventing drunk driving but I still think we live in a screwed up society when they send organ donor cards to someone like me.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1992,"2012-01-31",4.4,"""Thanks to the Three Penny Taproom for having this on tap! $6 poured into a Hill Farmstead glass. It was served a bit too cold for a honey ale.
A - Id call this a very dark Newcastle. It looks more like a porter than most brown ales. Poured a 2 finger head but quickly went away after a minute.
S - Brown sugar, nutmeg, cloves, honey and fresh cut grass. Id love to have a bottle of this on a hot summer day served super duper cold. 
T - Birch syrup with cedar and lots of honey. It starts light and airy but finishes with a nice birch flavor. I love the honey and syrupr flavors and how well they go together! This is a great beer.
M - Heavy like a porter. Very dense but surprisingly perfect.
