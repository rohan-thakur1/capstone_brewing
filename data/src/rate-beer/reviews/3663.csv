3663,"2017-01-21",4.0,"(500ml 2014 bottle from Systembolaget web order shared) Pours dark copper with a thin bubbly white head. Aroma of butterscotch, toffee, buttery oak, vanilla cream, coconut, toast, spirit heat. Flavour is dark caramel, toffee, clean but dominant whiskey flavour, oak, light to moderate vanilla, light toast, some spirit heat with light drying quality, lightly fruity, dried apples. Whiskey (generic) finish. Medium full body, high carb. Quite heavy on the sweet/vanilla/oak end of the barrel character spectrum, makes it feel a little less complex than other variants. Still a nice sipper.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"
3663,"2017-01-15",4.2,"50cl bottle pours with a clear amber to mahogany colored body that supports a tiny tan head. The aroma offers up sweet malts, marshmallow, a dash of caramel and then boozy whiskey. The taste starts smooth sweet and rich and quickly hitting whiskey booze wrapped in sweet marshmallow. It gets into a nice caramel sweetness and then it slides into a slightly warming booziness into the finish. Great sipping experience.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

3663,"2016-07-29",3.9,"Bottle (500 ml) shared by JulienHuxley. Slightly unclear deep copper with a small quickly vanishing off-white head leaving no lacing and little legs. Aroma is of wheat whiskey, nice malt depth, loads of toffee and caramel, alcohol of course, dried fruits and mild oak spiciness. Taste is rather sweet but it fits well with the profile dominated by dried fruits and toffee. Theres also some fun oak presence, plenty of alcohol while not being overly boozy and mild malt spiciness. Full body. Moderate carbonation. A bit oily mouthfeel but the main feature is the malt richness. Fruity and moderately warming finish. Not a beer that I enjoy drinking that much but theres no doubt its well executed, deep, flavorful and complex.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

The smells of deep aged beer. Seems like it has been matured in sherry casks which I find a bit like that tones. Dark fruit, dates, bitter orange, hazelnut, apricot. Dark spices and noticeable vanilla, butterscotch and honey. The flavors provide first coffee, chocolate. Is small stock character and it tastes a bit like sherry barrel again. Flavors of moscovado sugar, caramel with some alcohol flavor. Towards the end it will produce little grapes and more sherry with some bitterness. The beer seems sweet. Plump body, somewhat marked bitterness, medium carbonation. A bit too sweet, should probably stored a year or two to.","Falkenberg, SWEDEN","woomThomas12"

3663,"2016-03-24",4.5,"Tap pour - 2014 edition - deep, dank brown pour with a thin film - hard to really say this is a good looking beer, but it also gives off a vibe of what youre about to experience. Aroma is full of whiskey, toffee, caramel malt, barrel - almost warms your nose as you inhale - beautiful stuff. Flavor is excellent as well - brown sugar, toffee, caramel, vanilla, whiskey, and wood...this is the beer equivalent of a nice, mellow sipping bourbon, and a great example of what barrel aging can do to an already world-class type beer! Palate is top notch - carbonation is almost zero...but creamy and fulfilling - boozy, as one would expect, but doesnt drink anywhere near its ABV. Was excited to try this one, and expectations were exceeded...","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","valpoaj"
