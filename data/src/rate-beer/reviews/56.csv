Nose is rich with the following aromas: smoke, chocolate, coffee, charcoal, mesquite, burnt sugar, wheaty with wheat germ sweetness. Brief wheat floury flatbed to the nose. The nose also has some smoky spiciness to it, like a grilled chili pepper. There is also a buttery richness to the nose like a torched macadamia or a burnt candlenut. Will come back to the nose again when the beers warmed a bit more...molasses, brown sugar, hint of boiling cane syrup funk, wam honey, medicinal nose, almost like liniment.

Mouthfeel is thick and soapy with a little spicy bite at the top of the mouth with the first slug and then at the back of the throat. Palate has chocolate, coffee, charcoal, stewed fruit, sweet ripe stone fruit, dates, and maybe a little yakitori like umami-sweet-spice. The spice is bell peppers, poblanos, ancho and some smoked or preser4ved chilies.

56,"2016-02-10",4.3,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 10/14/2019. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and rocky dark brown bread with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Incredible appearance. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted dark bread, molasses, chili pepper, smoke, tobacco, nuttiness, light dark fruit/licorice, pine, light char, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, cocoa/spice, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted dark bread, molasses, chili pepper, smoke, tobacco, nuttiness, light dark fruit/licorice, pine, light char, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Good amount of roast/char/pine bitterness and pepper spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted dark bread, molasses, chili pepper, smoke, tobacco, nuttiness, light dark fruit/licorice, herbal, pine, and roast/char earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, cocoa/spice, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitter/spiciness balance and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Good amount of dryness from bitter/spiciness as well. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/chalky, and sticky/resinous balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Very minimal pepper heat as well. Overall this is an outstanding spiced American stout style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, cocoa/spice, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink.

56,"2016-01-16",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2016 Spiced porter from Mikkeller, bottle bought online. Very thick, towering, dense, deep beige head leaving cobweb lacing on the edge of the glass; colour is an extremely dark burgundy brown, but completely black in appearance. Aroma of espresso beans, charcoal, tree bark, dried chili peppers, dusty old cocoa powder, dried thyme and bayleaf, green pepper, cedar wood, mocha ice cream, almond and even toasted coconut, smoked pipe tobacco, earthy black radish, raw potato, liquorice, black shoe polish phenols, black tea, dried mushrooms, caramel, toasted rye bread, natural iron. Quite intense onset of candied fig sweetishness, deep blackberry sourishness and, perhaps more than anything, beef stock umaminess; soft carbo, smooth but thick and oily body especially seen the ABV, deep and rich nutty and toasted malt bittersweetness leading to roasted coffeeish bitterishness aided by the peppery and herbal hop bitterness on the one hand and a subtle dried chili pepper burn on the other hand, functioning remarkably well together; alcohol remains completely hidden and a lovely black chocolatey and roasted malt bitterness remains in the throat after swallowing for a long time; so does a slight, subtle, weak chili burn, by the way. I do not get the avocado leaves at all but that is probably just because I have no idea how they are supposed to taste...  I love this: this beer is packed with flavour and a warming aroma.

The taste is, especially as it warms, a well of complexity. Creamy, full, heavy with huge malts without being cloying, fresh herbal notes. Roasty notes, some hops, but not too much, various herbal notes showing up from time to time, presumably from the herbs added, certainly werent hoppy or from the chili - which basically shows up in the finish and in the aftertaste, helping create a warming feeling one would associate with a stronger beer.

56,"2015-09-07",3.5,"Wow, strange beer. So yes a lot of stuff going on from all the extras - though its hard to really discern the contributions of black beans, almond mild and avocado leaves- perhaps a sense of not knowing what to look for. But the more familiar cocoa and chili were definitely noticeable. At first I wanted to compare this to CCB Hunahpu, and it many ways it is comparable, big thick black and chewy with a chili-chocolate tone in the finish. But I noted it lacked the rich fullness of Hunahpu, then I realized it is only a 6.6% stout/porter, so of course. Then I was impressed to realize how much body and complexity they packed into such a moderately malted beer. But in the big picture, its hard for me to call it a total success. The rich sweetness of Hunahpu helps balance out the herbals and botanicals but here, those elements create an almost astringent and herbal bitterness that detracts from the total drinkability.

56,"2014-07-26",4.1,"Átlátszatlanul fekete színű testén egy krémes, kakaó barna habpaplan telepszik meg, kissé robusztusabb kinézetet adva a főzetnek, mint amire számítottam. Egy füstölt keretbe ágyazott illatorgiával kell aztán szembesülnünk, melyet a söröktől általában idegen összetevők jelenlétének tudhatunk be. Némi kötözött sonka aromája tűnik fel előttünk, melyhez pirospaprika, telt maláta és enyhe kókuszos-vaníliás vonulat csatlakozik, összességében azonban a chili rendkívül hangulatos jelenléte a meghatározó, melynek imitt-amott felbukkanó, pajkos csípőssége aztán ízében is kimutatható, természetesen nem fékevesztettül égető, inkább játékosan bizsergető formában. Igen érdekes jelenség, amint az édeskésen induló ízvilág egyszerre csak átfordul egy pácléhez hasonló, paprikás chips karakterű, növényes jellegbe. A vaníliás, kókuszos ízhatás számomra kevésbé valósul meg, az avokádóval kapcsolatos ismeretségem pedig meglehetősen szegényes, némi fekete babos hatás azonban határozottan érvényesül. Az eddigiek alapján nyilvánvalóvá válhatott, hogy jelen tesztalanyunk nem az a megszokott ""beszélgetős"" sör, a hagyományos és jól bevált összetevőkön edződött ízlelőbimbók valószínűleg sírva menekülnek előle, az újszerű hatásoktól kevésbé idegenkedő, kísérletező kedvű fogyasztóknak azonban mindenképpen megéri kipróbálni.","HUNGARY","adster"

56,"2013-08-07",3.9,"Bottle enjoyed at home with family and tacos. Pours nearly black with thick, dense, creamy mocha head that sticks around and leaves all kinds of lacing. Aroma is mostly cocoa, roasty, with a bit of pepper. Taste - surprisingly dry, unsweetened cocoa and a nice bit of chili spice at the back of the throat. Avocado leaf is huge in this, and dominates the flavor. (Okay, seriously have no idea what the hell avocado leaf tastes like or what it adds to this.). Spice lingers nicely, bitterness muted. Medium body, average carbonation, oily texture, alternatingly feeling a little thin and a bit viscous (don't know how that's possible, but that is what I'm feeling). Some tanginess. Overall: not stoked by the first few sips, but this one grew on me quite a bit, and I was loving every sip by the end.

The aroma has a vanilla like scent to it up front and a chocolate character that then has a richly roasted malt character, a spicy / herbal note that is quite unique, and a toasted nutty and whole grain character.
 
Lightly sweet with lots of roasted character that has a certain bitterness to it. The finish has a bitter herbal note to it as well as a rounded, sort of earthy flavor to it. The beer has a light carbonation to it that works well with the rich, though not heavy, body that lingers a bit on the palate. The beer gets a touch spicy after a couple sips and then is noticeably spicy, though only lightly so, from there on out. Rich dark chocolate notes, roasted nut flavors , ample toasted whole grain brown bread flavors that arent quite burnt, as well as burnt berry like fruit notes.

Here goes.... hmm... roasted malts with a slightly rotting veg flavour. Not getting much chili at all, but I rarely do in beer. Different, yes. Drinkable, yes. Warming. Tasty. Stays with you.

Brune foncée quasi noire, col épais moka avec une mousse qui perdure sur les rebords du verre.
Arôme se développe généreusement au fil du temps, presque à t° ambiante, les piments percent vraiment bien sans pour cela dominer et se combinent avec un malt riche, entre chocolat, grillé une pointe lactose sirop qui de suite me rappelle lhorchata que je buvais en Floride. Se note aussi une fine note feuillu de citronnelle. 
Palais est épais, léger quoique extrêmement complexe. Le profil malté est profond alternant la douceur du chocolat, une pointe de lactose sirop et ce concentré de riz typique de horchata. Une fin de bouche réchauffante avec les piments qui donnent juste la petite pointe en plus pour une chaleur de bouche se faisant présente mais sans vraiment ruiner le tout. Le houblon est discret mais discernable juste en fin de bouche o^juste une fine note damertume perce. La bière reste très épaisse venant peut être de cet ajout de black beans. Comme je ne sais pas ce que sent une feuille davocat je ne me prononcera pas sur le bénéfice de cette dernière dans cette bière.
Au final, sympa, à boire encore même si jai été un peu déçu car il y a quand même qcq ingrédients que je nai pas vraiment pu noter.

Well, of course as expected this is a completely black beer, and the head is light brown and extremely potent when the beer is poured. Futhermore, its really stable and would probably look like whipped cream until tomorrow if Id let it. Extremely thick lacings. Aroma is obvious chocolate, coffee, spices and a bit tart. Hops and sweet malts, though at the same time roasted. A typical close-to-perfect Mikkeller stout aroma. The taste, oh the taste - at first a bit sweet & sour contrasts, then the sweetness breaks through and lets me taste some chocolate, before turning more roasted and coffee like, just to end in a nice, quite strong, bitter finish. The chili is there as well, but not as progressive as expected (maybe because I just ate a garlic bread an hour ago), but I like the subdued strengthness of the chili. Dots a tiny bit on the tongue.

Taste the same with more spice and even more roast. Almost astringent malty. High carbonation, a little thin bodied. Ends bitter, also fron hops. And the chili? Weaker than the other ""Rangers"". Fine brew but more smoked than mexican...","Copenhagen, DENMARK","jesperhammer"
56,"2012-04-13",4.1,"(33 cl bottle from Toft Vin; BBD: March 12th 2016) Pours black with rich, crema-like brown head. Pretty lace and decent retention. Porter-like dark aroma with a clear presence of hops. Notes of smoke and something akin to licorice. Creamy texture, medium body - which is nice since it doesnt get too heavy - soft carbonation with a lingering, bitter finish. Flavour is like a smooth porter a moderate bitterness on the back that seems dark and peppery. Nicely rounded and not too agressive - despite the chilis. Girlfriend says: ""I think its difficult because weve eaten the Mexican food and I dont know which part is giving taste to what Im drinking.""","DENMARK","humlelala"

56,"2012-04-08",4.1,"On tap. Pours an opaque black with a dense and creamy light brown head. Very fresh roasty nose with very subdued imprints of the massive array of spices. Medium body, great and chewy roastiness, slightly sweet with a vanilla whiff. Has a distinct malt bitter finish. Very high drinkability in this one. Basically just a very, very good Porter - all the hip ingredients are very subdued which to me is quite good news. 070412","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"

Light chli bite int the finish. Rather hoppy and more like a black ipa than a spice/herb/vegetable. Vague smoked touch too.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
