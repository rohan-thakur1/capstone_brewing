3972,"2016-02-20",4.5,"I basically hate black IPAs and I still think this beer is incredible. It balances the roasty elements with the resinous and slightly pithy hops well and doesnt come out overly bitter, somehow.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"

3972,"2016-02-03",3.9,"Draught at Armsby, 1/30/16.Another technically flawless beer from Hill. Appearance is perfect, the aromatics are all quite on-point, with coffee, various other roasted notes, earthiness, vanilla and some pine and citrus with a bit of juiciness breaking up the intensity.Assertive in the mouth, it comes off as even more than 6.8% with a strong roasted element adding a ton of bitterness, especially in concert with the citric/piney hops. Perfect texture, with just a touch of slickness from the roasted barley and the same charming, rustic, fresh house yeast character weve all come to know and love from HFs beers. Attenuation is good, of course and theres still a ton of maltiness left to provide texture. Uncompromisingly bitter, roasty and hoppy through and through. Much too much for me, and I didnt care for the beer one bit, but Im sure this is exactly what most stout/hop heads want from this type of beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3972,"2016-01-26",3.1,"On tap at Blackback Pub.
They poured it into a tulip, yeah well.
The appearance was a dark brown to black color with a thin off white foamy little head that quickly dissipated. Lacing was few and far between (barely there).
The smell started off with grassy bitter and hop indulgent citrusy notes rolling into a light bitter cocoa and coffee bean, its good.
The taste was mainly the same with the bitterness really taking the lead and amplifying the dryness rolling into the aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a nice sipping to almost sessionable sort of feel to it. Carbonation feels good allowing the bitterness hitting my tongue appropriately.
Overall, Black IPA, well, it works, but its not the best one of the market, better ones. Nice to try but Id seek other Black IPAs before this, just saying.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3972,"2012-12-23",4.0,"Thanks to the Turd for sharing yet again. Changeup from the brightness surrounding this one, James was a surprisingly awesome black IPA. Im less skeptical about the style than some, though Im usually left underwhelmed at best. Unapologetically black pour, with a big foamy carbonation and abundant lacing. Citrus and pine in the nose along with faint roasted malts, chocolate and molasses shading into the pine. The balance is even more apparent in the taste, where the darker flavors come across more like added herbs in a bread made of bright hops or something like that. Pumpernickel IPA? It drank pretty awesome.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Aroma of piney hops is incredibly intense with great floral qualities. Taste is a mix between roasted malt notes with light bitter and dry notes submerged by a huge amount of piney hops with some citrus notes. Body is average with good carbonation. This a great demonstration on how dry-hopping should be done to limit the bitterness of hops but ensure floral piney notes are prevalent.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
3972,"2012-10-08",4.0,"My Bottom Line :  
This cuddly Black IPA proffers lemon pie over humid earth, before coniferous hop resins kick in, massaged by roasted cocoa allusions.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A creamy head of foam covers the darkness.
-The soft, natural-feeling carbonation does wonders for the mouthfeel.
-The hop intensity was relatively low for a Hill Farmstead brew, but this might only be because of the kegs age. No idea when this was last brewed...
-Bready undertones are tasted as well.

Chocolate, roasted almonds, coffee, and light citrusy hops make for a quiet, dark aroma; flavor is somewhat similar, but with a resinous interior that shows the green a little bit more, though still not really very much.  The hop qualities in this example seemed very relaxed and even almost hidden to me, and it wasnt clear if the malts were meant to be the star of if they were drawn to the stage by accident.  Their flavor is excellent; lots of chewy chocolate, nougat and nuts, with a smoky haze of roast.  That distant hint of resin and citrus rind is enough to keep my senses in this thing.

3972,"2011-02-02",4.4,"In short: Second best Black IPA out there after Stone SSR.  That simple.
How: Tap on location directly at the brewery
The look: Clear back-ish body (like Coca Cola) topped by a long-lasting small tan head
In long: The nose is uber-hoppy, this really is hop bomb, plenty of citrus and tropical fruits and pine-tree over roasted coffee beans.  Taste has a nice malt backbone of roasted coffee beans, chocolate cake and dark fruits.  Just enough to add to the complexity of the beer without stealing the spotlight from the hops.  Hops are shinning, vibrant and fresh.  Highly aromatic and not all that bitter, this is a very tasty beer that never feels aggressive.  Citrus fruits, tropical fruits and fresh pine-tree.  Some chocolate and coffee beans in the after-taste.  This is without a doubt among the best Black IPAs out there.  In my opinion it is second only to my beloved Stone Sublimely Self Righteous Ale.  That Hill Farmstead brewer can really work miracles turning water, cereals and bacteria into wonderful beers.

Pours pitch black and almost complety opaque with only the slightest hint of deep, dark mahogany edges when held to a light source and a one finger beige foam head that settles into a lasting ring. Sporadic chunks of lacing left behind.

Interesting aroma with hints of roasted malt as well as some sweet citrus and earthy pine hop notes. Slightly roasted with hints of chocolate and caramel but not as malty as I expected.

Medium bodied with a nice bitter blast of earthy hops up frotthat is immediately coutered by sweet citrus and tropical frut notes. The roasty malt is minimal and is actually used to counterbalance the hops. Subtle toasty bread, chocolate and caramel but this beer is all about the sweet citrus and tropical hop flavor. Only slightly bitter with some earthy pine as well as some grapefuit, lemon, pineapple and orane peel. This was a really interstig beer and one of the better black IPAs ibe had.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
3972,"2011-01-07",3.8,"On tap at Capones.  Dark brown with a haze.  Nose is pine, orange and some chocolate.  Medium body with moderate carb.  Taste is grapefruit and dark roast.  Kind of simple but nicely balanced.  Another winner.  These five beers from Hill Farmstead are as solid a grouping as ive tried from one brewer in a sitting.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
3972,"2011-01-05",3.7,"Draught at Capones:  Aroma of dark malt, hops, pine, slight rye, chocolate malt, slight resin, slight roasting, and caramel malt.  Poured with a small, creamy, dense, tan/light brown head that lasted throughout.  Clear.  Slightly sparkling.  Excellent lacing.  Flavor is medium bitter and medium sweet.  Tastes of hops, pine, light caramel, slight roasting, light chocolate, slight resin, and malt.  Medium body.  Slightly oily, slick texture.  Average carbonation.  Malt, caramel, light chocolate, pine, hops, slight wood, slight roasting, finish is medium bitter and medium sweet.  I would prefer this a little more bitter, though it is currently very well balanced.","King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA","michael-pollack"
3972,"2010-12-28",4.0,"Growler sample shared with oakbluff (via Glouglouburp). Opaque and near black in colour with medium carbonation. Huge fresh citrus and herbal hop aroma backed by some dank basement and faint chocolate notes. Hops dominate on the palate as well with more leafy citrus combining with dark chocolate, char, pale malt, and a hint of chalk. Refreshing and hoppy, without being overly bitter or minerally. Really well put togeather.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
3972,"2010-12-23",4.2,"Growler courtesy of Glouglouburp- huge thanks again to Dany my HF mule.  Appearance- murky brown cola, nominal head, some light lacing.  Nose-   pungent dank hops intertwined with nuts and slight roast. Taste- very hop forward- solid bittering hops, citrus, then a back end wave of medium roast, caramel and dark chocolate. Lingering grapefuit pith leads a nicely drying finish. Carbonation is spot on and hasnt suffered from travelling all the way to Winterpeg.  Very balanced hop forward beer if that makes any sense. Excellent stuff and another winner from the good people at Hill Farmstead.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","oakbluff"
3972,"2010-09-24",4.0,"Growler, Shenandoah Throwdown.  Pours a clear dark brown to black body with a frothy light brown head.  Nice citrusy nose with a chocolate and lightly roasty note, very bright smelling.  The flavor is a nice mix of coffee, roast, and bright citrusy hops.  Id probably call this a really hoppy Porter.  Medium bodied with nice light fizzy carbonation that really brings out the bitterness well.  Very nice beer.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
3972,"2010-07-14",4.0,"Growler shared by ygtbsm94 6/6/10: Pours an opaque dark mahogany with a spotty-lacing beige head.  Has a huge fresh resiny piny hoppy nose with some sweet dark caramel and chocolate malts.  Starts with good fullness and sweet toasty dark maltiness and fresh resiny flavor hops with nice bitter balance before a crisp, lightly roasty, bittersweet finish.  An enjoyable black IPA.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

3972,"2010-06-21",3.7,"Very strong citrus hop character is somewhat floral with biscuit, toasted and chocolatey malt undertones in the aroma.  Dull, dark, mahogany brown body is topped by a low, off white head that lasts well.  Biscuit and chocolate malt flavours are somewhat overtaken by very strong bitterness that lasts long into the aftertaste along with citrus hop flavours.  Medium body with moderate carbonation.  Sampled on tap at the brewery.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
3972,"2010-06-16",4.2,"On tap at Farmhouse in Burlington. First note: this is by no means a porter, and should be re-categorized. Pours very dark, nearly black, with a beautiful, tight light beige head. Aroma is full of hop character, with pine resin, blood orange zest, a touch of grapefruit, and some floral notes. Slight chocolate and caramel malt adds a bit of balance on the nose. Flavor is excellent; very hop driven, more evergreen and citrus hops leading the way. Palate has great bitterness, but still smooth and drinkable. Another great beer from Shaun Hills new brewery.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
