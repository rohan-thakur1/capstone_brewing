2012,"2016-12-25",3.6,"From bottle in Belgian ale glass. Pours brown with thin head and aroma of roasted malt and some nuttiness. Smooth drinking with a fairly dry finish. The nut element is not overdone as it sometimes can be. Solid.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","ANZUShophunter"
2012,"2016-11-23",2.6,"Not the usual Brown I am used to. Very flat and the head died very quick. Notes of biscuit and nut slighty toasty. Quite boring in flavour. Disappointed. Alesmith IPA was 100% a winner though! Shame because, I am a Dark Drinker.","Ingle Farm, AUSTRALIA","IPAWarden6"
2012,"2016-08-27",4.0,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle filled 06-07-2016. I presume this is the right one to post this review under. Mahogany brown pour with a quick-lasting head. Aroma of nutty and roasted malt sweetness with a low to no hop profile. Maybe earthy. Medium body with a little acidity and carbonation. The taste is sweet and roasted all the way around and generally mild and easy to drink. Dry finish. Quite decent.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
2012,"2016-07-01",4.0,"Taps opaque chocolate brown with a thin but acceptable light tan head. Aroma features, toasted malt, caramel, cinnamon, clove and woody hop tones. Flavor echoes the aroma, not quite as intensely, but fairly well, though the spices vanish into the background; the hop note is a little stronger. Mouthfeel presents decent body and lively fizz. Draft beer, not people!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
2012,"2016-04-15",3.9,"Tap at Butcher and boar with commonmac. Rated with a cold. Bumped pint. Dark red brown with really nice foamy white head. Malty nose. Taste is well balanced sugar, malt, and grain bitterness. Really well done, right down the middle carrying a bit of all the elements. Was worried it would be too malty but it wasnt. Tiny bit of roast and nuttiness. Nicely done.","Minnesota, USA","commonshawn"
2012,"2016-02-21",3.4,"Not a bad beer at all. I can see why it has a 95 on here. Apparently making your Brown Ale in the English style is a good idea.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","bpreo"
2012,"2015-12-22",3.9,"at old Alesmith last spring. Cant say I like it better than the regular, but they are both pretty great in style. Smooth, nutty malty goodness, light roast and more caramel than the norm.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
2012,"2015-08-02",3.7,"On tap at The Libertine Pub, Morro Bay. Much better than the Cream Ale, but far from this brewers hard hitters. Hazy brown, nutty, brown sugar, creamy. Nice brown ale.","NETHERLANDS","alethol"

2012,"2015-03-20",3.6,"Draft at FarBarLA. Brown/red pour with a nice off white head. Nutty, spice, malt and Brown sugar aroma. Super nutty off the back , hints of spice, smoke, char, buttery feel on the mouth of course a nutty after taste. Not a big fan of nutty beers but this was a pleasant experience.","Los Angeles, California, USA","Savage_Night"

2012,"2014-10-30",3.4,"On tap at 10 East - 

With the recent flood of SD brewers at 10 East, I finally had a chance to try their Brown Ale and it wasnt a disappointment. A sweet raisin bread like aroma with a touch of dark chocolate and fruit juice. A surprise find of roasty notes in the flavor dept, with an ample malt backbone. Kinda like a mini-porter. A good gate-way beer.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"
2012,"2014-10-09",3.0,"On draft. Nice malty aroma. Flavors of caramel and nuts and maybe a little Cracker Jack. A little too sweet, perhaps.","","TylerGreenDC"

2012,"2012-08-24",3.5,"Brown in color with a nice finger of khaki head.  Strong toasted malt aroma, a nice nuttiness, and a surprising amount of roasted malt.  A fair amount of of cocoa, good toffee sweetness, and light scents of burnt nuts.  The flavor is a bit more bitter than expected, but still has some toffee and toasted malt sweetness.  Lots of roasted malt, almost burnt nuts, and a touch of earthy hops.  Heavy on the bitter chocolate at the finish.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2012,"2012-06-23",3.5,"Draft. Hey its brown.....imagine that. Too much nutty bitters for me. I go for one or the other but not together. Too complex for my simple palate.","Oregon, USA","chris2431"

2012,"2011-07-29",4.0,"Taster on tap at AleSmith:  Cloudy brown color with a medium light tan head. Aroma is toasty and nutty with hints of fruit. Flavor starts malty and nutty (the nuttiness is sharper like walnut) followed by light caramel sweetness, some fruit and a dry, lightly bitter finish. The palate is medium and smooth with moderate carbonation.","San Diego (Mira Mesa), California, USA","papajohn"
2012,"2011-07-17",3.8,"On tap at the brewery, served in a tasting glass. Pours hazy brown with a small tan head. The head fades slowly to a thin cover and leaves a small amount of lace. The nose has toasty malts, with anise, lots of flowers and caramel. The flavour is reminiscent of an English mild, with a smooth, moderate malty sweetness, anise, raisins and a toasty character. The finish is long and somewhat malty sweet. On the palate, it is medium in body with a smooth, creamy texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a nice nutty brown ale that is quite reminiscent of a traditional English mild. The English yeast has given it a nice anise quality and makes this one more interesting than its Nautical Nut Brown cousin. 2011-06-05","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"
2012,"2011-07-06",3.5,"Served on tap at the brewery after a round of golf. The appearance is a slightly hazy brown with a small off white head. The aromas are pretty fruity and less roasty then the original. The flavors follow suite. Fruity esters, almost some banana, bready, and still has that hard nut flavors. The mouth is pretty creamy. A nice one off.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"
2012,"2011-06-30",4.1,"Sampled at the BA Spoedway release. This version had a touch more fruit forward, but was drier on the palate. A bit more toasted nuts as well. I could drink a lot of this beer. Another winner.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
2012,"2011-06-30",3.6,"Draft @ Alesmith during the recent BA Speedway release - This beer is similar to the Nautical Brown.  However, it has a touch more esters, a little more bitter and drier.  Overall, its good, but I like the Nautical Brown better.","BFE, Arizona, USA","cbkschubert"

Nuts, bread, lightly toasty, lightly fruity, chestnut, and a bit of earthy hops.

2012,"2011-06-16",3.8,"On tap at the BA Speedway release. A very good beer! Pours with a deep brown body with a lasting tan head (good lace). Aromas are bready, toasty, grainy (lovely malt presence), brown sugar, fruity and estery (classic british yeast notes). Very nicely blended, rich, but not heavy, enjoyable. Flavors are deep, nutty, malty, brown sugar, toasty, bready, light caramel, estery and fruit. I could drink this all day. Very smooth, creamy, medium bubbles with a toasty finish. Very well done. I drank the 12oz sample with ease and enjoyment!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
2012,"2011-06-09",3.8,"Taster at the brewery, sampled with the Summer Yulesmith cask event. Pours a chestnut brown color with a small beige head that soon dissipates. The aroma was mild, earthy and nutty. The flavor was malt forward with chocolate malts and roasted barley on top of layers of chestnuts, pecans, filberts, and walnuts. The palate was light but effective with lively carbonation. Finishes medium in duration and dry. Overall: Very impressive, this would make a great cask ale.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"
