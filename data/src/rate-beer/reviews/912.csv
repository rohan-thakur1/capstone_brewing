912,"2016-07-03",5.0,"Une earl grey black steam beer, genre californien bien sûr, de 4,8 % abv pour 44 ebu, avec malt pils
et divers colorés, houblonnée au Pride of ringwood dAustralie.
Mon exemplaire avait 3 mois de plus que sa date limite.
Couleur brun noir intense, à lopacité très forte (ebc de 88).
Mousse brun moyen foncé, à flocons fins, stable à 3 mm.
Arômes de malt fin, jus de poire cuit, écorce de chêne, groseille à maquereau.
1ère bouche souple sur du café, bois rôti, pointe de fumée très fine.
Arrière-bouche large, bien équilibrée, au mat torréfié très long.
2ème nez de groseilles noires fines.
Bouche à la magnifique évolution maltée.
Arrière-bouche avec un équilibre malt/houblon vraiment performant.
3ème à la grande suite maltée avec une pointe de thé.
Arrière-bouche suave.
Longueur qui se déguste avec des nuances superbes.
Jambes fines, longues.
Levure de caractère, boisée, très belle ligne.
Alcool qui fait beaucoup plus que son niveau, il tient lensemble avec brio.
Finale qui donne encore dautres nuances.
CONCLUSION : grande bière californienne, qui dabord ne présente aucun défaut, mais bien plus, qui ouvre la perspective dune steam beer sur un horizon encore non atteint. Le fait dêtre en black
steam ny est pas étranger  Très beau.","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"
