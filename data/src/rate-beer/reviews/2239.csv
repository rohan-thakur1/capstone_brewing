Arôme est fruité avec une légère note aigre de pêche et abricot, note boisée et de copeaux de bois, petite note de caramel.
En bouche, on ressent de suite une influence de lambic avec lajout de sucre roux. Le tout conserve la base de lambic jeune qui est perceptible dans la Tilquin à lAncienne. On a donc un palais mi doux et mi aigre avec un profile sucré roux agréable rappelant la cassonade. Pointe fruitée de raisin blanc, abricot et pêche avec un petit picotement sur le palais.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
