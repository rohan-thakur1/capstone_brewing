2091,"2014-12-06",3.6,"Bomber. Thanks to ModeEngage! Hazy yellow with a thin, foamy, clean white head that lasts in spots and laces likewise. Aromas of lemon, yeast, spice and light floral notes. Flavor is the same. Light bodied, crisp with a dry finish. Slight bitter bite on the end.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Concealer"
2091,"2014-12-05",3.2,"Straw pour, small white head. Aroma is barnyard and light fruit. Flavor is barnyard, yeast, hops.","Somerville, Massachusetts, USA","williamstome"
2091,"2014-09-29",3.5,"14 karat pour with a massive ivory crown. Ample carbonation and an assertive flavor, particularly given this beers 4.7% ABV. Grassy, herbal, citrusy, and floral. A solid brew but nothing special.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
2091,"2014-09-24",4.1,"Bottle from Julios. Pours out a light slightly hazy yellow color with a huge fluffy white head. Light citrus-spice aromas and flavor. Easy drinking with a lingering dry breadiness. Good stuff.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","MaBeer1972"
2091,"2014-08-30",3.3,"Murky dark gold pour, 4 finger off white creamy head. Very soft fruity saaz and other fruit light hops. Chewy herbal with a touch of soft pine notes and a touch of hearty rustic bitterness.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
2091,"2014-08-30",3.6,"750 bottle purchased at Julios. Hazy golden color with spotty lace in the snifter. Aroma is lemon, floral hops and grain. Flavor shows a floralness up front with the grain and lemon in the main base. The bitterness is low and has a dry, crisp finish.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2091,"2014-08-24",4.0,"Best beer on tap at idle hands. Really hoppy and interesting with bright doughy cracker malts, and a spicy well balanced yeast. Finish is herbal grassy hops that make the beer.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
2091,"2014-08-24",3.9,"draft at idlehands, yeaaaaaaaaup this is awesome, tons of hoppy flavors, good balance, light body adn malt prescense, moderate yeast presence. great stuff,","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
2091,"2013-12-31",4.3,"750mL Bottle. Beautiful rocky head and fantastic spicy Noble nose. The body is dried out and ever so slightly funk, with the funk seeming to come from the hops in a dry, peppery way. This reminds me of early, lighter Jolly Pumpkin a la Bam Biere. The biting spiced hoppiness works really well with the dryness. Insane lacing. Fantastic light pale beer. I would buy this every day.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
2091,"2013-12-22",4.5,"hazy gold, puffy white head with crater. Coin and hop nose, very dry with sweet fruit. Plenty of grapefruit lingers mid, lots of salty pine finish with light soap, biting carbonation suspends body well, bit thin through the end but nice otherwise.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
2091,"2013-12-14",4.4,"750ml bottle I picked up at Julios. Pours a clear gold with some creamy, white head. Nose is awesome, tropical fruit, lime, pineapple, pungent but not aggressive, floral, wet grass. Flavor is grassy, malty, light pepper, tropical fruit, key lime, zesty chive, garlic scape. Dry, spritzy finish. Really excellent.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
2091,"2013-12-13",3.8,"75cl bottle, thanks nimbleprop. Medium white head atop hazy lemon yellow body. Aroma is moderately sweet, grapefruit, some pineapple, spicy. Taste is moderately sweet, grapefruit, some pineapple, light bread. Light body, light acidity, dry finish.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2091,"2013-12-13",4.1,"Golden pour. Beautiful nose and flavor of mango, key lime, hay, pineapple, lemongrass. Very dry, beautifully attenuated. Really nice.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
2091,"2013-08-28",3.9,"In short: Discreet pale malts and plenty of fresh floral-grassy hops, very good thirst beer. 
How: Bottle 750ml, fresh, from Loineshawn but I disinfected the bottle after he touched it.
The look: Cloudy dark blonde body topped by a persistent medium white head leaving lots of lacings on the glass.
In long: The very much hop-forward nose is very floral and grassy. In mouth the beer feels a little bigger than its small 4.7% abv size, a fluffy texture, plenty of carbonation. Taste has discreet crackery pale malts with low sweetness, this beer is not for the malt lover. A hefty amount of lemongrassy, floral and fresh grass hops providing a lot of flavors but without a whole lot of bitterness. Currently listed on ratebeer as a Golden Ale/Blonde Ale but to me this is more of a Pale Ale or APA. Whatever this is, it is a nice thirst beer. Good beer, but having an Enlightenment is not what its cracked up to be, no awakening to the true nature of reality or any of that stuff, actually I pretty much passed out after this beer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2091,"2013-08-25",3.8,"Bottle brought by Brian to tasting at my house. Pours cloudy yellow gold with white head. Nose and taste of white sugar, wheat malt, citrus zest, orange zest and yeast. Medium body. Great beer for a style I dont usually care for.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
2091,"2013-08-25",3.8,"Bottle at a tasting at James place. Pours a hazed gold with a medium to large white head. Soft musk and a bit of yeast on the nose. Medium-bodied, nice bit of grain, soft musk, hints of lemon. Funky, musk and more yeast. Big and musky, very easy drinking with lots of nice stuff going on.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
2091,"2013-08-19",3.4,"750ml bottle in a tulip. Pours golden with a lacy, off-white head. Aroma of floral and light piney hops, some pale and light caramel malts, and a little spiciness. Flavor the same. Average texture. Not bad but it could be better.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
2091,"2013-07-05",3.9,"Hazy golden body, massive white head, dense fluffy lacing. Lemon, grass, floral notes, a little spicy hops and yeast. Medium bodied, lively carbonation, dry finish with moderate bitterness.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
2091,"2013-06-07",3.4,"Pours slightly hazy gold into a tulip.  Bright white head with good retention recedes leaving spider lacing to coat surface. Marshmallow and sour grape aromas. Biscuit and dough upfront turning to sour hay and grass in the middle before the abrupt earthy bitter finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
2091,"2013-06-05",4.1,"750 ml bottle. Poured into a tulip. Golden orange with a fluffy white head. Lacing is very nice and the head retention was long. Aromas of grass and citrus. Some floral notes are also noticeable. The bitterness leads to a very dry finish. This beer reminds me a lot of Oro de Calabaza without the brettanomyces. Enlightenment Ales are quietly becoming one of my favorite breweries.  A really solid drinkable golden ale.","Lynnfield, Massachusetts, USA","VikingHammer"
2091,"2013-05-22",4.3,"fresh bottle.  pour a glowing golden hue with a big fluffy long lasting white head.  awesome bright clean juicy lemongrass, fresh herbs,  fresh cut grass.   dry. big time carbonation.   quite tasty and sessionable.   super beer.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
