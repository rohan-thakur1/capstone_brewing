754,"2016-12-15",3.7,"Bottle, gifted by a kind soul to my friend Joe, then generously shared w/ me... mududes!

Pours basically black with a small head that leaves good lacing on the glass.

The Aroma is reasonably faint but its sweet & coffee forward. Invitinf enough if perhaps less than exciting. 

The Flavor is great. There are loads of chocolate maltiness & sweetness... Bunches of rich coffee. Plenty of bitterness & roast, with a bit of vanilla. 
Delicious","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
754,"2015-11-22",4.0,"Thanks Joel! Poured very deep brown with a creamy, dense, well-retained toasted beige head. The aroma picked up sweet, toasted maple, cocoa, and vanilla with even more cocoa deep on the back.. sweet, and it struck me as more of a porter/light stout, but it was really nice. The flavor found toasty cocoa and vanilla bean throughout, with a bit of coffee and wheaty bitterness on the edges.. a little sharp and tacky toward the back.. lost of cocoa and vanilla plus peppery alcohol on the sweet, succulent finish. Medium-plus bodied with a creamy middle on the palate.. transitions were off in a couple places, but overall very good.. nice one!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
754,"2015-09-24",3.7,"Shared bomber poured to snifters, showing a black/brown color, with a decent, brownish tan layer of head foam, and wavy ribbons of lacing. The nose was roasted & mocha notes, with touches of vanilla & licorice. Medium bodied, with fair carbonation, and moderate roasted & earthy bitterness, the flavor was more as cocoa, caramel, & toffee. The infusions seemed to have negated a number of the style characteristics, but was still quite tasty, and with somewhat hidden alcohol, a bit more dessert-like than warming.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
754,"2015-09-16",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2015 22 oz. bottle. Pours oily brown black with a khaki sudsy head that fades. Smells of roasted malt some coffee and bakers chocolate, vanilla some faint booze and marshmallow. Taste is really nice chocolate milk with coffee and vanilla roasted burnt malt some marshmallow, as this warms the wood is becoming presant. Palate is full slick slightly sticky, and the alcohol is very well hidden. Really nice brew!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"

754,"2015-02-09",4.3,"Very good beer. Lots of chocolate and coffee. The wheat mixes well with the coffee flavors. This beer features more coffee bitterness than sweet chocolate, but both are there.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","kkleu357"
