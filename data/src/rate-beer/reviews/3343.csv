Almost clear (until the final pour) golden with a hint of amber hues. A nice nearly white head. A sweet aroma of nectarines and something like pomegranate.

Nose is very complex with citrus, pine, tropical fruit, and goodness knows what else appearing in the aroma. Medium body. The flavor again is complex and shows all the hops involved so there is grapefruit, pine, stone fruit, tropical fruit, and floral taste. What is good is that it all hangs together. Good balance for these many tastes. Finish is bitter and earthy. Good beer in all aspects and the low ABV is a bonus.

3343,"2016-08-29",3.5,"A steady pour into my Spiegelau IPA glass produces a three finger thick, light tan colored head. The beer is a nice copper / amber color that shows a clear, golden-copper hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells of floral, fruit laden, and backed by herbal / woody hop notes. Notes of tangerine zest, lots of lychee, kumquat, bright peach candy, guava, big tropical fruit notes, white sage, subtle pine, and a touch of woody pepper character play the prominent role. As the beer warms up it gets a touch more herbal and dank.

The beer has a light sweetness to it up front, but then quickly dries out through to the finish where it gets bitter, woody, and herbal. Light guava notes, peppery citrus zest, and some floral tropical fruit notes are noticeable, but much reduced from the nose; instead the flavor is dominated by the woody and herbal notes; pine, menthol, peppery sage, lots of woody turpenes, and a lingering, hoppy astringency in the long finish. The body of this beer is light, yet has some texture to it (perhaps it is the tannins from the hops), so that it does not come off as thin.

This beer focuses alot on the linger, bitter, astringent hop character. I usually prefer over-the-hop beers that are more focused on the smooth, tropical and floral notes over the bitter, astringent notes.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3343,"2016-02-11",3.8,"Truth is...I just passed my half-birthday and what better way to enjoy your half-birthday than a Hoppy Birthday from Alpine? Truthfully, Ill use any excuse to sample another IPA from this brewery. The open neck exposed, the aroma is delightful, and I could swear my Citra and Simcoe are involved here, though the inclusion of two of my favorite hops will not dissuade me from a mediocre review if the beer doesnt warrant a good one. Fresh, ripe mango and petunias on the nose, the beer itself is just as visually appealing.
- With no aggression in the pour, the glass is filled with liquid amber, a finger of soft, off-white foam blanketing the surface. The aroma is startling for a session beer, but I withhold judgment, knowing that there are hundreds of session IPAs out there that fall flat past the aroma. This smells heavenly, and I bring the glass in for a taste.
- The level of carbonation is excellent, and the floral and pine of the flavor is accented nicely by the fresh fruits on the nose; tremendously well balanced in all aspects, right to a supportive but subtle malt foundation. This is quite sessionable! The fairly high ABV notwithstanding, I could drink this all night. The tasty finish is crisp and clean, drying my mouth just enough to keep me coming back again and again, the brew nibbling at my tongue delicately but with enough bite to bring a smile with every tip of the glass.
- All in all, Ive got one thing to say. Hoppy Birthday to me!","USA","lightbias"
3343,"2016-02-11",3.6,"Bottle from Last Drop.

Nice orange pour, orange-inflected off-white head. Pretty straightforward IPA nose, nothing too tropical or oniony. Easy drinking but not thin or acerbic like some session IPAs; theres just the right amount of sweetness in the malt base. Hops are predominantly herbal with maybe a bit of pine. Now, 5.25% is pretty high for a session IPA, but its certainly among the best Ive had. Still, I wonder if the brewerys reputation isnt carrying it just a bit here to get into the 99th percentile overall on the site. Id be happy to drink this any time but it doesnt cross into the territory where Id work very hard to seek it out.

Oily, mouth-coating resin, impressive body for ~5%, nice smooth carbonation.

Porus a hazy gold with a good head and lots of lacing on the glass.

The aroma is like a freshly opened bag of peletized hops, but not from any particular varietal. Just sort of raw and generically hoppy smelling. Its pretty leafy with some fruitiness, not bad, not really much going on though. 

The flavor pulls off about a medium level of bitterness and again comes in strong with the leafy hop character. Its got some mild pine, some more restrained citrus fruit, and a plesant enough level of driness. 


I guess Im a little befuddled as to why this is a top rated session IPA, its not bad beer, but its tasted just like this every time Ive had it, and I just dont see how its hugely appealing.

There is a lot of bright tropical fruits and hop presence on the front end before it moves through to a little bit of a maltiness. There is an earthy bitterness and a a little resin. The flavor should be interesting here. It's not what I wanted it to be. There is such an earthy bitterness that is malt driven. There is a dank sweetness that pokes through on the back end. The mouth feel is thicker and creamy with a lingeringly malty bitterness that carries out long after its gone. I would hope for more from Alpine, but Green Flash sucks. They should leave this alone.

A beer like this couldnt be passed up despite the reputation of Alpine these days. After trying it I may give a few more drafts a shot. If it is anything to go by theyve not lost their A game in cranking out world class West Coast hop bombs.

Aroma / Appearance - A bronze carbonated body shimmers below a layer of protective white head. Bright rosy hops, fresh citrus, and floral aspects lazily float upwards like dandelion puffs in a summer breeze.

Flavor / Palate - A first sip delays the sharp bitterness for mere seconds before it explodes on the tongue and throat.

Chewy cereals and their caramelized accents welcome coniferous hops and their bitterness in this personable pint.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the hazy amber.
-Resinous bitterness balances out the finish.
-This one wasnt as crisp as the usual Alpine hoppy brews, to me.
-Hops also contribute citrusy fruitiness, unsurprisingly.

3343,"2015-06-06",3.8,"On tap at Dutchs. Keg received yesterday, dated March 12. Despite being nearly 3 months old, this is still drinking impressively hoppy. Nice bigger grapefruity and citrusy hop, its IPA-level hoppy. Kind of spicy and peppery. Assertively bitter, too. Essentially what many would call a ""session IPA"" -- but more balanced, fuller than the typical SIPA, with a substantial biscuity malt backbone. Hop forward for sure, but there is some malt to appreciate beneath it. Just a touch musty, slight hint of a metallic edge, but the age is not bothering me anywhere near as much as I thought it would, this is all minor. Along with the big hop aroma, theres a bigger bitter taste too, for a pale ale. Pretty assertive. Lighter sweet. Clear orange color. Thin off-white head, leaves some decent splotches of lace, kind of loose. Good head retention. Medium body. Smooth, kind of soft lighter carbonation. Dry finish. Definitely a solid pale ale.

Glass: Firestone pint glass
From: Alpine Beer Company Pub in Alpine, Calif.
Price: $12.82
Purchased: Oct. 24, 2014
Consumed: Oct. 24, 2014
Misc.: N/A

Poured a honey, orange, semi-hazy color with 1-to-2 fingers of khaki white head. Slow stream of bubbles coming up from the bottom. Below average spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. Below average spider web retention on the top all the way down. (Sight - 3.88)

Smelled a ton of pleasant hops, reminding me instantly of an IPA. Got Citra hops, floral hops, grapefruit, orange, orange creamscicle, nectarine, tangerine, caramel, tropical hops, orange pulp, mango, pineapple and slight earthy rye hops. Best initial Alpine comparison is a Nelson. (Smell - 4.63)

Tasted a lot like the nose, although I dont think quite as good. Got Citra hops, floral hops, bitter grapefruit rind, orange pulp, caramel, orange creamscicle, nectarine, tangerine, tropical hops, mainly pineapple and mango, and New Zealand hops. (Taste - 4.50)

Medium body. Oily texture. Average carbonation. Long, bitter citrusy finish. (Feel - 4.38) 

Just a fantastic pale ale and I feel like I kind of underrated it. Glad I still have ¾ of a growler left. (Overall - 4.50)

3343,"2014-10-20",4.2,"Growler: Thanks to Jeff for filling this long time void. Appropriately hazy; faint golden & nearly yellow color with a layer of soapy & foamy white bubbles that hang around casually on top. Beautiful aroma of wet grass, pine, juicy & dripping wet citrus peel, pineapple, candied mango, grapefruit, light sugar cookie malt, a touch of hop oil & a dash of leafiness. The flavor hits you like a basket of freshly mowed lawn trimmings; grassy, lightly weedy, with an overcast pine element that dangles in & out. Hemp oil covers lines of grapefruit rind & tangerine peels, injecting a modest bitterness, sprinkled with a white peppery herbal spiciness. Small undertow of pale malt sweetness towards the finish with a small bit of green onion, grass, & leftover tropical fruit rinds. Dry finish, crisp & it doesnt overstay its welcome on the palate.

The beer appears straw yellow and slightly hazy. The head is thick and white, displays lasting retention, and leaves ample lacing on the tulip glass. The aroma...wow. One of the best aromas in a pale ale I have ever experienced. This would give any IPA more than a run for its money. Fresh hops and a blast of varied citrus. The flavor is absolutely phenomenal. This is perhaps the most drinkable and enjoyable <6% beer I have had the pleasure to sample. Perfect? Ya, pretty much. My highest recommendation.

Clearly filtered, Hoppy Birthday has a transparent copper orange color with visible resplendent carbonation rising from the bottom to refresh its creamy white head. The head loiters and leaves a good splattering of lace on the glass.

This has a monster hop aroma. Lots of floral notes, mango, orange rind, and pineapple.

Up front the sweet pale malt sets the table for the hops. The hop profile is pretty amazing overall. Lots of mango, grapefruit, and pineapple give this a great, well rounded bitterness. Being a lighter beer, this is something I could easily drink all day during the summer.

This has a nice, smooth carbonation that really helps to keep the beer clean. I like when there is no unpleasantness lingering - the bubbles lift up and carry away any residue so each sip starts out with a refreshed palate. 

This is pretty damn good. There are four pale ales I find worth my time, every time. Zombie Dust edges out Hoppy birthday on my personal favorite list, with Daisy Cutter and Alpha King tied for a distant third. That is splitting hairs, though, this is another win for Alpine.

3343,"2011-11-19",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2016 Updated rating: Bottle from Vons: Poured a solid gold that sparkled and fizzed with bubbles while a fat cap of foam head rested on top. Aroma is dominated by green oily hops that just ooze of acidic citrus like scents but not quite as fresh from the bottle as it was from the tap--must have had several weeks of shelf life. The same can be said for the flavor of the drink as it delivers a puckering bite of bitter hops but not as intense as I would have expected. Finish is clean and is easily quaffed down and I see why they listed ""Session"" on the bottle. 

1st rating November 19, 2011 On tap @ Toronado: Liquid poured clear sparkling golden ale with a thick frothy layer of foam head.

Pours a moderate yellow-orange color with a white head and some pretty good lacing. Nose brings forward some really nice tropical, floral, and citrus notes. It seems like theyve crammed every single hop variety into this one and then balanced them all out perfectly. The taste is similar with some really well defined hop notes. I got the most out of the tropical hops, though Amyliz4 got more from others. This is just stupendously well done with a beautiful balance between bitterness and drinkability. This is probably the best APA that I have ever had. Thanks again, Mike--I really owe you one.

The head rises a few fingers and settles with a nice cap, decent lacing. Crystal colors and contrast, looks great... The aroma is very sharp, at the most basic level its a mixture of catty/dank and sweet amarillo like hops. Other notes of pine and lemon, very good. Its sweet but dank... The taste isnt as sweet as the nose, more of steady hops throughout, not super bitter though. Light grapefruit on the front. This is an apa that tastes like an ipa but drinks like an apa. Has to be one of the most flavorful drinkable 5% beers out there. The aroma is outstanding, well worth trying.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

3343,"2010-11-03",3.8,"Tap at Toronado SD a couple weeks ago.  Pours a medium golden-yellow color with one finger of white foam.

Like I said, a very hoppy aroma.  Flavor is also full of earthy sticky hops with lots of pine and sharp grapefruit.  Though big on hop aroma and flavor, this is not overly bitter.  I am surprised that the ABV is this low considering how otherwise big this beer is, though it could probably use a slightly stronger malt backbone.
