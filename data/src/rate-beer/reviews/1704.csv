Drucken med någon månads mellanrum har jag svårt att känna skillnader. Möjligtvis är den lite äldre med mindre spänstig humle, åtminstone hamnade jag på ett lägre betyg än senast. Gott hur som helst.","Malmö, SWEDEN","Vignale"

1704,"2014-06-12",4.0,"Draught at Kino, Göteborg. 
This hopfenweizen has all a hopfenweizen should have.
Hazy apricot yellow colour with rich foam. Intense green hop nose with tropical fruits along with tinny phenols with notes of cloves and white pepper. Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied and soft leaning towards oily and the flavour profile presents a great balance of banana esters, hefeweizen-yeast and new world hops. Amazing how all these three can be so prominent at the same time. I like the fact that its not overcarbonated. Bitterness is medium. A tad too much yeast perhaps making the flavours less clear but thats nothing to go uff da about. Great beer!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rickgordon"
1704,"2014-06-12",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 23, 2014 Draught @ Brewers Beer Bar. Pours very hazy apricot golden with a rather big frothy offwhite head that slowly dissipates while leaving some thick lacing and trace on the glass. Smell is estery, fruity and tiny spicy with wheat crackers, banana bread, moist grass, pine needles, grapefruit juice, dried apricots, pineapple juice, ripe mango, cloves and white pepper corns. Taste is slightly malty, slightly bitter, estery, fruity and floral with wheat crackers, unripe banana, chives, freshly cut grass, pine needles, gooseberries, cloves, unripe mango, unripe pineapple and orange zest. Mouthfeel is soft, dry, astringent and light to medium bodied. Finish is bitter, fruity, estery and herbal with wheat crackers, unripe banana, cloves, chives, freshly cut grass, pine needles and unripe mango. Nicely estery and heavy hoppy. Bit green in the hop profile with prominent chives. Possibly too fresh... Will revisit...Re-rate! Sampled several times since the first rating. A few weeks later the green chive characteristics have faded and this has become what Id consider close to a perfect hopfenweisse. Very tasty. Enjoy it fresh but not too fresh...","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"
