Excellent quality, just rich and the pear is really blending into apple territory here. Any thicker and this will be sirop de Liege. Wheres the herve?","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

2437,"2015-04-21",3.9,"2 oz sample from bottle (200 ml). Harvest 2011.

Appearance: Amber-caramel color with some legs. 

Aroma: Pears, brown sugar, moderate spiciness, alcohol and a bit of oak (?).

Taste: Medium to heavy sweetness. Tons of pears, brown sugar, moderate spiciness, apples notes, and alcohol. 

Palate: Full bodied. Liquorous. Warming finish. Mild lingering spicy presence.

Overall: I think I prefer the regular version a tiny bit because the alcohol is a little less presence, so the balance is a tad better. But this one is also an excellent product. Really tasty Ice Perry.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

2437,"2012-05-29",4.0,"2012-05-26. Nice golden body, syrupy legs on the glass. 3+ Pleasant fruity aroma, sugary sweetness, light notes of caramel and apple skins. 7+ Flavour is lovely, sweet sugary fruit, hints at caramel accents, fruit, apple, pear, just enough fruity acidity to balance it a bit. Lingering sweetness and notes of fruit skins in the finish. 8+ Smooth silky medium to full bodied palate. 4+ Really nice. I would not necessarily have guess this was pear based and not apple if it hadnt said so on the label, but there is a subtle difference if you look hard. Not the most complex ice cider but richly enjoyable. Bottle, Limited Edition, Recolte 2009, via trade with cfrancis","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

2437,"2011-03-12",3.5,"Deep golden pour.  The nose has an odd burnt/toasted fruit character.  Dried leather and a little bit of chewy pear skin tannins.  Intensely dried and sweet.    Its got an odd sort of buttery character on the finish.  Doesnt really live up to my memory of the regular version.  It comes off a little bit plasticy.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

Flavor is big fruity pear juice, pear puree, pear skin with those big brown spots, earth, toast, light funky smoke, honey, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, phenolic meaty rubber smoke in the end with a big waxy mouthfeel and medium to low acidity.

2437,"2010-12-03",3.8,"Bottle.  Pours a golden body with nice legs.  Pear notes all the way.  Light toasted fruit tones.  Seems a bit off less sweet and light and more toasted caramelized fruit tones.  A hint of honey and caramel with a mild warming. Good but i believe this was a bad batch, given how much more i enjoyed their other perry.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
