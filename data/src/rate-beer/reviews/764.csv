764,"2017-02-13",3.4,"One tap @Rattle N Hum. Yupp, quite dunkel and deep this. Dark cloudy charcoal colored with a hefty lacing grey head. It smells just like sesame oil. A by all means I really love the Asian smell, but in a dunkel weisse? Super strange. The sesame oily is overwhelming everything elsewhere and I get nothing but it. The taste however is much more like a relatively normal dunkel weisse. Yeasty banana, its nice and dark malty. About average on the carbonation and a good oily texture. Soft chocolate wrapper and a little bit of bitter cocoa in the finish. Ripe fruits and dry licorice pastilles. Strange but I kinda like it more and more down the glass. 17.06.2015","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

764,"2015-04-05",2.9,"Draught at Apex, PortlandDark brown color. Dusty aroma, caramel. Overly sweet caramel flavor, with low bitterness, and that stale character of American Dunkelweisse; quite fruity though. There is some alcohol perception.Difficult to drink, cloying.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

764,"2015-01-17",3.8,"On tap @ Bear Republic. Pours thin very dark brown with thin light mocha head. Aroma is dry chocolate malt with slight oaky notes on the back. Taste is clean, light chocolate malt up front, then dry and more chocolate on the finish. Surprisingly hop-free for a winter warmer. Good chocolate flavor though.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"

764,"2014-05-11",3.7,"On draft at Tap 25. I was surprised this was listed as a Dunkelweizen. It pours a dark reddish brown with an off white head. The aroma is veyr toasted with some chocolate and cherry cola. The flavor is rich with heavy dark fruits, raisins and plum with a dense bready malt background and cocoa. It has a nice herbal, raisin finish. Warming and tasty. Seems more like a Dunkler Bock to me. Not a lot of yeast character.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

764,"2014-01-17",3.6,"On draught at Lord Hobo, 1/16/14Deep cocoa-colored body is mostly opaque, with a small, but fairly well retained beige colored head.Nose begins very chocolatey (dark chocolate, cocoa powder) with some esters from the yeast mixing with it to produce a slight vinousness that balances the chocolatey sweetness well. With warming, you get a more dry molasses and banana note, with some wheat-like dryness as well. Still, the chocolate is quite strong here, I wouldnt say unbalanced, but it dosent seem like a dunkelweizen with just a touch of chocolate. Moderate to moderately strong aroma is pleasant and lasting.Initially, the chocolate flavor, while authentic, is quite rich and somewhat overpowering. Oily, almost bitter cacao notes are present, but the rich, sweet sugar is more dominant. Velvety, somewhat slick mouthfeel shows moderate carbonation and fortunately as it warms, the sweetness becomes more bearable (which is definitely not always the case). Yeast phenols and light malts attempt to balance, while the alcohol helps dry things a touch. Very rich, warming beer (this is a winter warmer, afterall) that is enjoyable, if somewhat slightly overdone on the chocolate sweetness.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
764,"2014-01-04",3.4,"On draft. Aroma of ripe fruit. Flavors of raisin, licorice, cherries and a thin chocolate finish. Chewy. Slightly sticky on the palate, esp as it warms. Alcohol present.","","TylerGreenDC"

Sweet cola flavor, lots of banana, and clove. Roasted malt, cocoa, light coffee, and dark fruits. A bit tart on the finish.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
764,"2013-12-23",3.8,"On tap at Bear Republic, pours a deep dark mahogany with a medium beige / tan head. Aroma brings out a mix of cinnamon and cocoa, and toasted dry caramel malt. Flavour is similar, bringing out cocoa nibs, a little cinnamon, and toasted caramel. Full-bodied and creamy, with lots of flavour. Everything is in perfect harmony and it drinks very easily.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
764,"2013-12-12",4.1,"On tap at the brewery , pours a dark black pour with a small head. Nose is deep chocolate and dark roasted espresso.

Flavor has some more toasted bready malts, a hint of clove and a thick banana pudding sweetness. too heavy and sweet.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
764,"2013-04-13",2.7,"Pours murky and brown. Small head. Im normally pretty easy on appearance but this one is sorta ugly. Looks thick. Smells sweet with molasses, caramel, dough, milk chocolate, but theres also a funny medicinal note that Im not enjoying. Taste is quite sweet in a cough syrup like way. Lots of that band aid flavor in the finish. Kind of a gummy, syrupy feel. Im just not a fan of this beer. The flavor combination doesnt work for me. It needs some sort of a balancing note at the very least. An unusual miss from bear republic.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
