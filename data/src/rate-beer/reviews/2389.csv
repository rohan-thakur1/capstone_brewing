2389,"2015-04-23",4.3,"There is so much to like about this as a beer, to my mind. Banging amount of floral up front, crashing amount of sweet malt to carry it, and a finish that is hinting to dry but is quite a soft landing. Lovely linger and overall a bit lovely, Brilliant dark chestnut with a lovely head and great lacing. A beer to write poetry by","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","Pdubyah"
2389,"2015-04-06",3.4,"On tap. Pours a hazy dark red with fluffy tan head. Earthy hops and bready malts in the aroma. Slight caramel notes. Taste is of toasted malts, a slight sour tang in the sides of the mouth and a rounded bitterness. Bitterness lingers in the finish along with a mild sweetness. Somewhat sticky mouthfeel.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","GlassBrass440"

2389,"2013-08-01",3.9,"On tap at Pomeroys, I must confess that this is a great beer to make up for any poor choice for the first pint of the evening. If the first choice does not go down well, get Lady Danger and youll ne alright. This a an excellent red-coppery ale - I find ""amber"" an understatement - it will garantee a lovely parade of fruity aromas and floral biternesses. Loaded with very bitter acid grapefruits and sweet grapes, this Lady Danger will compensate for any previous incongruous or disastrous affairs and she will make your night infinitely more enjoyable. Oily, with a resinous vein and a metallic bite, she will stay in your mouth with a stinging sensation of bitterness and caress your senses in an extremely rewarding fashion.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"
2389,"2013-05-18",3.9,"On tap at Pomeroy?s in Christchurch. Being from Australia, I had never heard of this beer and had the pleasure of meeting Ava herself. Very impressed with this brew, poured a lovely deep red colour with decent head, and lovely citrus and hoppy tastes. Left a nice bitter after taste on the palate. Overall very good red ale. Well done Ava and Epic.","AUSTRALIA","Mattress63"
2389,"2013-04-04",3.7,"great amber ale. extra fruitiness, very citrusy. it almost seemed as if there were some red berries in here, imparting a slighly sour note? also a great lingering bitterness. very tasty.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","lisagirl"
2389,"2013-01-09",3.9,"Ill start on a brief negative: too damn cold. Everything else in this review is positive. I was positively glad to try this beer. I positively devoured it and I positively ordered a second. Red is such a glorious colour in beer and I want to see more red ales. This had very much a red body with a white head. Aromas of red orchard fruits, pecan nuts, Gala apple peels, nectarine and spruce. It follows quite an evocative theme this. The flavour smacks of Luke Nicholas guiding hand with monstrous bitterness and shed-loads of sprucy hops. There was fruitiness without the beer being effeminate. It was grassy and challenging with amber aplenty and a lip-smacking lingering finish. I also have to give credit to the label designer: a great job and a great idea for a beer. A front runner for my favourite local beer this summer.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
