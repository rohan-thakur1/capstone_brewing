4576,"2017-06-05",4.6,"Im happily finding that Sierra Nevadas Ovila releases capture a lot Belgian tradition. This spicy, citrusy Wit is a continuation of that trend. Cloudy pale yellow color and a white head. Spicy and citrusy nose. Clove, lemon zest, white pepper, yeast, and banana flavors. Light-bodied and lively feel. Dry finish with just a hint of sourness. A brilliant choice to follow a long, hot bike ride.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"
4576,"2017-06-03",3.8,"Bottle-Pours bright yellow hazy hue with a small fizzy white head that didnt last very long just leaving a small fizz around the edge of the liquid surface. Nose of bright lemons, corriander, light grass, slightly spicy in a german hop sense. very nice. Flavors are slightly sweet lemons, lite tartness, grass, corriander, light metallic notes. Pretty solid overall. Very crisp and refreshing on this 90 degree St Louis day. I enjoy this quite a bit. i may actually go back and get another 6er of this. Long tart and slightly grainy finish. Solid","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
4576,"2017-06-01",3.8,"12oz bottle. Pours lightly hazy pale gold. Thick, foamy white head that slowly dissipates. Nose is sourdough, spice and grass. Yeasty flavors with clove, banana. Pleasant, funky finish.","South Carolina, USA","Bacchus66"
4576,"2017-05-27",3.8,"appearance:  cloudy light yellow, full white head slowly shrinking to a creamy collar.  aroma: slightly skunked but in a good way, with toasted coriander, a hint of fennel, and candied orange peel.  taste: peppery yeast, coriander, orange peel, cracker.  finish: lingering slight yeasty funk over pepper, light grass, and lemon zest; palate is light but fulsome.  notes: 	Great wit. Id like a slightly zippier palate like Port Citys Optimal Wit, but this was quite nice.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"
4576,"2017-05-25",3.9,"Bottle from Bine & Vine. Pours hazy light gold with a slight white head. Aroma of banana with some mild spice - likely clove. Med body, maybe. Flavor is banana/clove. Not mild either. This is so frikin Belgian. Zest is detectable, but I had to think about it. Mostly banana and clove for me. Must be really ""authentic"" yeast here. Not usually a witbier fan, but love this one. Not entirely dry, and the clove subs for bitter. Just delightful.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
4576,"2017-05-20",3.4,"Pour is a hazy straw with a huge white head. Aroma is a decent clove and coriander. Flavor is wheat malt more coriander and maybe some orange peel if you use your imagination. This was a fine wit beer. Maybe a tad thin but this was still pretty flavorful.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
4576,"2017-05-19",4.2,"Pours an opaque yellow.... Sparkling white head. Nice aroma of lemon, Belgian spice, hay. Nice zesty feel, dry finish.

4576,"2017-05-09",3.4,"Tap at BeerNV
Slightly cloudy light yellow. Aroma is light, almost to a fault. Very light citrus spice and yeast. Those flavors eventually come out on the pallet, but this is the first Ovila that wasnt a standout in-style.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

4576,"2017-05-05",4.4,"Im thoroughly impressed by a Sierra Nevada beer for a change! Hazy golden sunshine color with a blanketing head of white fluffy foam. Orange peel right up front on the aroma with some yeast underneath. Flavors comprised of light banana, yeast, subtle soft orange citrus, and peppery in the finish. Well inspired and well made.","","PugUglyBrewer"
