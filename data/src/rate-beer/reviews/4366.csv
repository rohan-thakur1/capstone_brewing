4366,"2012-02-19",3.6,"On tap at Monks Kettle, SF. Really interesting brew, almost to me like a hybrid between a schwarz and a dry stout. Very good on the rainy afternoon I tried it. Big body, smooth and creamy with pleasantly chalky finish. Sharp roast malts and bitter hops in the nose, a bit of molasses added in the taste. Good one.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
4366,"2011-12-13",4.1,"A - Served a dark black color with a touch of brown with a thin finger of chocolate colored head. The head fades down at a normal pace leaving behind some nice lacing.

S - Aroma is full of sweet lightly burnt chocolate malts with a bit of caramel and milk sweetness mixed in as well.

T - Starts off with a mix of sweet burnt chocolate malt and a bit of lactose sweetness to balance it out a bit. Through the middle, some richer burnt malts come through with a bit of coffee coming through as well. The finish is a mix of sweet roasted chocolate with some milky caramel sweetness alongside.

M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with a slick and slightly thick mouthfeel.

D - Very drinkable. Really like the heavily roasted flavors and sweetness. Interesting mix of a lager, but it turns out to be super tasty.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"

4366,"2011-11-07",4.5,"Several pints on tap at Jupiter in Berkeley, CA.  The aroma on this is super chocolatey and super roasted with some anise present.  There is an underlying light metallic character likely imparted by the lagering process.  The beer has an opaque black body with a medium tan head that is very creamy.  Great lacing, too.  Starts with some metallic hints, before this becomes roaster, burnt, and full of anise.  This is super clean, smooth, and creamy.  There is a light underlying sweetness, but it is not too cloying.  A really drinkable beer, with an awesome mouthfeel.  A great lager.  I would drink this all the time, if available.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

It smelled like dark chocolate with hints of coffee. The taste was similar with the added heat of the alcohol. The mouth feel is what really surprised me. This tasted much more like a black lager than death & taxes. Very drinkable very good!","San Francisco, California, USA","koshea"
4366,"2009-11-07",3.8,"Draft @ Hopmonk. Pours a dense, dark chocolate-brown color; light-tan head with good retention and scattered, fine-bubbled lacing. Lots of highly roasted malts, coffee, touches of nougat and toasted malts in the nose; nicely dry; some dark chocolate and plenty of roast; maybe the most generous schwarzbier aroma I can think of. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: lots of heavily roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of lightly bitter mineral notes; very nice roastiness, with a lightly sweet cola character present as well; at the core, an easy-drinking and highly complex dark lager; generous and roasty, with no alcohol apparent. Lengthy finish: roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate; nicely dry and again, exceptionally complex. Nice.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
4366,"2009-11-06",4.0,"On tap @ Flavor Bistro.Deep mahogany with a a one finger beige head, pretty good retention.  Lots of roasted malts and milk chocolate behind--not as burnt as the Death & Taxes.  The flavor adds some pine hops to be noticeable, but nothing crazy.  The chocolate turns dark as well.  Bitterness peaks @ a 3 in the roasty, slightly burnt finish.  Nice sheet of lacing as well.  Light to medium body with light prickly carbonation.  I like this more than D&T.  Tasty!","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
4366,"2009-11-05",4.0,"On tap at Monks Kettle in SF.  Damn, this beer rocked!  Nearly jet black in color with a lasting tan head.  Aroma is nice roast, chocolate, coffee, and earth.  Awesome roasted and earthy flavor with fresh coffee and rich yet bitter cocoa as well as mild hops.  Body is medium and palate is smooth and a bit dry.  Awesome schwarzbier, on of the best Ive tried.  Better than Death and Taxes IMO.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

4366,"2008-12-04",3.4,"Poured from tap, at Barclays, black with a large tan head.  Aroma is malt sweet with roasted coffee, grain and nuts.  Flavor is sticky-chewy sweet malt with toffee, roasted coffee, cocoa powder, and ending with a small burst of toasted hops that never assert any bitterness.  Overall the flavor was nice, but a bit loaded on the sweet side for me.","El Cerrito, California, USA","rayOfBeer"
4366,"2008-11-29",3.8,"Draught at The Red.   Black with an everlasting tan head.   Caramel corn and dark chocolate aroma.   Strong, roasty dark chocolate flavors, with a rich, yet subtle hop balance.   Medium bodied and a bit chewy.   Very assertive and roasty for a schwartz, almost american stout territory.   Fuller and more assertively roasty than Death and Taxes, but not quite as magically balanced.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

4366,"2008-10-27",4.0,"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Pitch black with a thin mocha head that leaves filmy lacing. Boozy brownie mix aroma, kinda like Southern Tier Choklat but lighter. Some red fruity esters too. Flavor is light milk chocolate sweetness that gets trampled by more bitter dark chocolate. Dry herbal hop finish complements the roastiness. Fluffy body, light but flavorful. Well-crafted beer, great for lovers of the darkest bitterest chocolates.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

4366,"2007-01-15",4.3,"from notes:

(on-tap @ Toronado) pint is jet-black, with no light comming through. unfortunately the pint is a bit too over-full, so head and lace are minimal to non-existant. nose is full and chocolatey, with rich roasty notes, and perhaps a bit of dark fruit. flavor is very rich and full, with clean chocolate flavor and a big roasty finish that dries the beer out nicely in the end. finishes suprisingly light and lively, especially given its initial impression of big, dark heaviness. hopefully Ill see this seasonal a bit more around town.

edit: had a pint today at Jupiter, where it was properly seved with a reaaly nice, dense tan head that left tons of lace. aroma seemed a bit livelier too, with maybe a lightly herbal hop note wafting above the proceedings.","Oakland, California, USA","irishsnake"
