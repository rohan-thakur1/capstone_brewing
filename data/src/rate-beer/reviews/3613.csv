3613,"2014-11-09",4.1,"On hand pump at Young and Jacksons, Melbourne.
This beer is an excellent example of an ESB however at 3.9% it is a little weak to be in style. 
Best tasted on the hand pump - pours slightly cloudy with a creamy, persistent head. 
Reasonable aroma - nothing amazing but solid.
The taste is excellent - right down the middle of an esb with low carbonation. 
I agree with previous comments that there is a high amount ofbdark malt here, but overall this deserves more praise than its received here.
Good bitter!","","JoshAsh"

The head is persistent towering and rocky, floating more than an inch above the rim. A palette knife was needed to square it off and get close to take in that wonderful bouquet. Big, bold, spicy and herbaceous whole hop nose that simply oozes passionfruit, pineapple, pear and lychee-like fruit esters with a sweet, biscuity malt edge. In the mouth it is more controlled and reserved. The body is light and the carbonation gives it good bounce. Light diacetyl is evident but not alarming, overall it is drier than expected. Toasted malt and barnyard grains start it off with just a lick of caramel. All hops past the mid-palate; quite piney and herbal, dry and husky with pronounced passionfruit and pineapple.

3613,"2011-05-14",4.5,"330ml bottle. Pours a clear golden amber, with a large off-white head. This offers fantastic retention and leaves decent lace. The nose is classic bitter territory, with slightly oily, pine hops blending with some softer, more floral hops and the merest hint of grainy malt. A flowery hint starts it, but is soon overcome by citrus hops, especially lemon and orange zest. A firm malt backbone makes itself felt in the middle, with light rye bread notes and burnt caramel prominent. It finishes with a bit more of a kick than most bitters, with moderate pine and grapefruit hops coming through. This breaks no new ground for bitter - it is a fairly straightforward interpretation of the style. What it does is simply to offer all of the elements of a classic English bitter in perfect balance. It is neither too hop-dominated, as some bitters can be, nor too sweet and malty, the trap that many bitters fall into. This is a lesson in properly crafted, restrained brewing. A beer of finesse and true class.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

3613,"2010-08-26",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 2, 2011 Big hoppy low alcohol pale ale. Nose is tropical fruit and pine. In the mouth has a decent body for the ABV with a fairly bitter finish. Quite fizzy on the tongue. A good choice for the low alcohol alternative, specially now its getting some decent distribution.MMMM hop burps!","JAPAN","jonno"

3613,"2010-05-16",3.7,"Draught. Tropical hops came through first, but then became more piney. The malt was nice and chewy and there was the right amount of bitterness on the palate. A great first beer for my week in Oz.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","TheGrandMaster"

Was lucky to get some of this. They were at the end of the 2nd last keg of it, and had to switch kegs halfway through filling my growler...my bad!

Pours an appealing creamy inch of persistent off-white foam atop a clear copper body.

Nice pungent hop-driven aroma; lots of grapefruit, passionfruit, stonefruits and leafiness, with a good measure of sweet biscuity, toffee n nut malt in the background.

Medium bodied, smooth slightly chewy malt texture and subdued carbonation, verging on cask-like.

Solid hit of sweet nutty malts straightup on the body, some subtle burnt toffee and roastiness about it. Hops race up mid-palate; agressive, resinous, lots of tropical fruit, citrus and woody spice that lingers with a firm bitterness to match.

Lovely beer! Plenty of hop and malt flavour, with great balance. Establishes itself as more of a British style bitter of sorts, but really shares alot with an American or New World style pale ale. Bloody nice regardless.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"
