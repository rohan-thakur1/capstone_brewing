Very dark red, almost black. Full and powerful, with a sweet yet smooth taste. Highly vinous, with plenty of dried fruit and some spices. Some barrel notes. Dry and lightly bitter finish. Medium body, and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a great strong ale. Strong, tasty, highly vinous and quite smooth. More mellow than the normal version, but then again, this sample is 5 years old.","Århus, DENMARK","Echon"

I doften enorma mängder torkad frukt, kandisocker, plommon, russin och maltsötma. Liten antydan till blöt kartong och lite ålderstecken, men väldigt sparsamt. Stor och fortfarande ganska pigg kropp. Kolsyran är kvar. Inte lika söt i smaken som i doften. Fortfarande mängder av torkad frukt och stor maltsötma, men här finns även en ganska stor beska som väger upp. En del ekighet, nästan lite lakrits och anis tillsammans med typisk belgisk kryddighet och en torr, lite stram avslutning. Här finns lite brända toner i bakgrunden som ligger nära de torra ektonerna. Bra djup och komplexitet, samtidigt som den är ganska straight forward och efter förväntningarna. Viss tendens till ålderstecken, men förvånansvärt lite för sin ålder. Bäst före 2019 står det på flaskan, men känns som den skulle kunna ligga i många år till utan problem.

W aromacie czuć głównie ciemne winogrona, jak dla mnie one dominują całą kompozycję. Poza tym trochę suszonych owoców, fig. Poza odczuwalną nutą wanilii, całość, wraz z lekko wyczuwalnym alkoholem daje dość winne odczucie. Generalnie jest bardzo intensywnie, aromat jest wyczuwalny nawet po odstawieniu szkła na stolik. W smaku już takiej bomby nie ma, bo jest trochę melasowej słodyczy, trochę winnego kwasku, cierpkości na finiszu i to by w sumie było na tyle. Taniny na finiszu raczej na poziomie autosugestii. Alkohol zaczyna co nieco się wychylać za słodów i drożdży wraz z ogrzewaniem, intensyfikuje się też odczucie kwasku. Wysycenie jest dość wysokie, choć bez przesady, nie zapycha, jest też przy tym dość gładkie w odczuciu.

Opaque, dark brown with a thin caramel head. Aromas of dried fruits (plums, dates, figs), caramel, herbs/spices, toasted bread, and honey. Arrives on palate with subtle dried dark fruits and caramel; develops a vinous, slightly tart, herbaceous, earthy middle and then moves into a finish of dark+milk chocolate blend & licorice. As it warms, the fruits and chocolates take center stage while still giving the wine notes some space at the end. Medium to light body with soft carbonation; quite lively for an old bottle! Smooth and rich in flavors while maintaining a balanced palate; excellent level of complexity throughout. Alcohol is very well hidden over its long glass life. Its tart middle shows off a lot of the French oak influence. Overall a pleasure to drink. This is a beautiful beer that achieves a nice blend of Belgian strong dark ales and French red wines.","California, USA","beer_queue"

Aromat: Bardzo silne nuty beczkowe, waniliny, drewno, trochę przypraw, delikatne skojarzenia z winem + aromat cukru trzcinowego z butelki, który wprost zniewala.
Wygląd: Ciemne, z momentalnie opadającą pianą redukowaną do zera.
Smak: Analogicznie do aromatu (zwłaszcza beczka), lecz nasze kubki smakowe mogą doświadczyć dodatkowo smaku dojrzałych owoców (śliwki, morele, nawet figi), likieru (wiśniowego?) oraz wspaniałego, długiego finiszu spod znaku cukru trzcinowego.

2861,"2016-07-30",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 16, 2016 Bottle, 330 ml, vintage 2012. Pours almost opaque dark red/brown with a rapidly dissipating tan head. Some medium sized carb bubbles visible near and on the surface. Sugary sweet, cake-y malt on the nose with a lot of stuff going on alongside - big notes of cherry, raisins/dates/dried dark fruits, cognac, milk chocolate, muscovado, nuts, dark rum, tobacco, all more or less competing for attention at the forefront. Behind this we have the wood, vanilla, and spices from the barrel aging coming through fairly modestly for now, not overtaking everything like in an Innis and Gunn brew. Smells more and more like a cognac over time. Taste is sweet to begin with with much more chocolate, specifically cocoa/drinking chocolate coming through, and more of a nutty, roasted malt character with some coffee and more of those cognac flavours. Alongside this theres dark fruits again - not as prominent than on the nose but quite juicy and sweet - and spicy, estery belgian yeast emerging before the finish - which is fairly abrupt, dry and with mild lingering dark malt bitterness. Body is medium-full and texture is moderately thick and super smooth - carbonation is fairly soft. Brilliant stuff and a must-buy for cognac fans!","Kent, ENGLAND","Cybion"

Taste is banana-ery ester, dark fruit, prune, stewed plum and peach, dark chocolate, little bit of aged second fill wood (something like port or little fortified vinous), little acidic on the palate. Slighted bitter roasted malt on finish which dries quickly. The nose on this is stunning but the finish is short and abrupt so this may be weakening in the bottle.

 Ekstrakt:  24% wag. 
 Kolor:  Ciemnobrunatny z rubinowymi refleksami. Piwo jest klarowne. 
 Piana: Takiego syku i tak szybko uciekającej piany to nawet nie widziałem i nie słyszałem przy otwieraniu coca-coli.
Zmierzyłem czas. Minęło dokładnie 25 sekund od nalania, by piana całkowicie zniknęła z powierzchni. Trudno nawet było określić jej kolor czy strukturę.
Na ściankach nie ostała się nawet JEDNA pojedyńcza plamka. 
 Zapach:  Beczka, beczka i jeszcze raz beczka!
Ogromna moc dębiny, starego mokrego drewna plus intensywna wanilia.
W oddali śliwki, rodzynki i jakby rumowa nuta.
Słodka, owocowa nuta od razu informuje nas, że mamy do czynienia ze szlachetnym trunkiem. 
Delikatny alkohol podkreśla wagę tego pierwszorzędnego napitku. 
 Smak: W smaku nuty ciemnych owoców wychylają się jako pierwsze. Śliwki, rodzynki, suszone jabłka i ciemne winogrona.
Nuty beczkowe stoją troszeczkę z boku, ale wciąż jednoznacznie określają, że mamy do czynienia z dębiną i wanilią.
Po kolejnym przechyleniu Tumblera moje kubki smakowe łechtają karmel i toffi.
Po ogrzaniu uwydatnia się również winny charakter piwa.
Goryczka niska o owocowym natężeniu.
Perfekcyjny balans poszczególnych fragmentów.
Niesamowita gładkość, ale i treściwość.
Ogromna lekkość picia przy zaznaczonym, niegryzącym alkoholu.
Wybitny Belgian Strong Ale! 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  
Pannepot Reserva jest trunkiem wybitnym. I nie boje się wcale użyć tego słowa.
Intensywność dębowej beczki, wanili i mokrego drewna uczyniły z tego piwa wyjątkowe dzieło.
Ciemne owoce takie jak: śliwki, rodzynki, winogrona, suszone jabłka dodały odrobinę słodyczy.
Karmel, toffi i lekka winność dopełniły resztę.

Dark brown with nice tan head that dissipated entirely after a few minutes. Smells of caramel and fruit. As this is an aged version of Pannepot, the flavor notes are much the same except more well rounded. Dark fruits, figs, and caramel come through mainly. The sweetness has subsided a bit from the un-aged version but in a good, melded flavor way. The alcohol is truly hidden at 10%.

Poured out of the bottle a dark translucent brown. 35ºSRM.

Nose is sweet and malty. There are some nice fruity aromas of plums and prunes. Light almost candy-like sweetness. Clean and not cloying. There is a woody charactero the nose which reminds of a being in a skiff or the smell coming off wet pine.

The palate on this thing is just divine. Carbonated and well balanced. It certainly isnt light with a ponderous and well-formed malty base where you get black bread, caramel, burnt sugar, toffee, chocolate, coffee and other dark stone fruits like prunes and honey plums. There is a delicious date-like quality to the palate as well. There is a light brief peaty smokiness to the palate as well.

The finish is bitter hops mopping up all that sweetness and the alcohol. There is a creamy buttery finish that then transitions into something fruity and clean and then ends with a nice combo flavor note of oak and hops. If you close your eyes, you can even imagine some sweet tobacco.

Alkohol praktycznie niewyczuwalny. Smak analogiczny - wszystko to czuc. Praktycznie brak goryczki. lekkie rozgrzewanie gardla od alkoholu. dlugie, owocowe, kwaskowate posmaki (jedyny zarzut ktory mi wpada do glowy - zbyt kwaskowate). W ustach pelne, niesamowicie kremowe, gladkie. Bardzo niskie wysycenie.

Jest tez troche nut ktore mozna interpretowac jako pochadzace z drewna (kawowo-drewniano-gorzkawe), mile, nieco taninowe. Jednak sumarycznie lezakowanie de facto zubozylo palete calosci (zniknely np banany, karmel stal sie mniej wyczuwalny). Piana tez wyraznie mniej okazala.

My friend Kepano donated this tiny treasure, for which I am very grateful. After many years of aging it makes its final departure from the bottle with a cloudy, murky brown appearance, with clear layers slowly swirling up and down like a sepia aurora borealis. And from this potion comes scents of almond, milk chocolate, cream and heady, rich custard. Like many exquisite Belgians it is at the same time dry and sweet. The flavor balances precariously across both the dry and sweet spectrum too, imitating the rich fan of flavors one kinds in skillfully brewed quadruples. A sampling of the tastes present include light pear, dusty wood, a moderate alcohol buzz, red grape, and a long, rich umami deep aftertaste with some of the bordeaux grape note lingering on the palate. 8 years in the bottle has given this brew some real meditation time, and I think the result is a lovely bouquet and flavor medley that won over all our hearts at this celebratory beer event.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

The nose was some roasted character, with a touch of cocoa, but mainly dark fruit as prune, cherry, concord grape, and raisin, with caramel sweetness, and a sherry-like scent. The flavor was malt sweetness, continued esters, a mellow amount of oaky & tanniny bitterness, a bit of tartness, and sherry-like alcohol whose warmth built slowly throughout the taste.

Młodszy brat Pannepot Grand Reserva 2009. Tym razem piwo jest ""jedynie"" leżakowane w beczkach dębowych. Nie ma zatem nuty winnej i nie jest tak alkoholowe, jak poprzednik. Mamy natomiast więcej nut słodkich oraz wzmocnionych ciemnych słodów, które były uprzednio bardzo łagodne, przez wpływ leżakowania w beczkach po Calvadosie. Nie twierdzę, że piwo jest złe, ale faktycznie jest nieco inne, jakby mniej aksamitne, a bardziej toporne. Czy to źle? kwestia gustu, bowiem także jest ciekawe, ale nie wyróżnia się już tak na tle innych belgijskich mocnych ale. Zbliżoną ocenę zawdzięcza głównie pianie, natomiast za taką cenę z pewnością po raz drugi nie kupiłbym tego piwa.

330mL bottle, 2009 vintage.
Polish off the old La Trappe chalice; kinda wish I had something a bit more la-de-dah, but itll do.
So what are we looking at, thats what were here for afterall...A deep, near-opaque bronze/mahogany coloured beer, thats what. Holds a small creamy tan cap.
Shes a bit shy at first to let her true odour to be released, but Im patient...its taken over 11 years to get to this point afterall...
Decidely vinous it must be said; black plums and blackcurrant esters, combined with medium-toast oakiness, woody spices of clove, nutmeg and black pepper, and a hint of vanilla. Add to that a good fat dose of burnt caramel and bitter chocolate maltiness, with emerging aged notes of raisin and honeyed fig.
A sipper for sure; you have to give a beer of this strength (and quality) your undivided attention otherwise youll end up rather intoxicated..
She sits laid out length-ways on the palate; long, sustained, has a smooth, syrupy quality, if only abruptly, thwarted by creamy bead, leading to an almost velvet-like sensation, not that Ive ever consumed velvet orally.
With all of this considered, one would assume she would be quite a sweet beer, but you know what they say about assumptions... But it does indeed start off with a decent helping of biscuity, treacle-y, cake-y, pudding-y sort of sweet malty goodness, but we digress and lead on from that portion of the entertainment to much more pressing, complex things. What things you may ask? Well how about woody spice, like cloves and mace, or perhaps throw in ripe figs and plum skins, and maybe, for a limited time only, nutty port-like rancio. Thats right; its all there. A good peppery punch of bitterness balances, but by no means dominates. A kiss of warmth from her boozy breath and she is finished.
Such a shame to lose her; why one bottle Muggus, for shame. 
Anyhow, lovely beer, truely. Worthy of an 1000th, or even 10,000th, if we ever get there...cheers!","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Deep brown pour with a nice tan head into my tulip glass. The aroma brings oak and some unexpected smoke, gingerbread, dates and prunes, cloves and other spices rising from a warm loaf of banana bread straight out of the oven, a quite prominant metallic note that smells like a bloody lip tastes (to my surprise, I see that I noted the same thing in my review of the Grand Reserva five years ago). The flavors are sweet but not cloyingly so, quad-like. Dark fruits, spice cake, juice from black cherries, the same oatmeal-raisin cookies that characterize the base beer. Dark caramel. Ricola cough drops, but not in a bad way. A hint of cola, a bit woody with hints of pear skins late. Alcohol becomes apparent as it warms. Resinous hop bitterness very late, like the aftermath of an imperial stout. Beautiful creamy mouthfeel, very little sign of the heat until much later deep in the throat.

Very elegant, balanced palate, with very fine, super creamy carbonation!! Wonderful mouthfeel!!! Alcohol is completely integrated. Flavors of dark, dried fruit, figs, prunes, sweet tobacco, cola, brown sugar, caramel, molasses, ripe banana and spices, elegantly linger on the palate for minutes!! Concentrated flavors, yet very refined and elegant overall.. Great stuff! Mmmmmmmmm.... Don't pass this up! For the style, this is near the top of its class, if not one of the best. Simply awesome!

The taste is really subtle and complex. Anything that may have been dominating or overpowering in this brew was quelled by four years in the bottle. Again, bourbon soaked dark fruits. Most of the heat of the bourbon is gone leaving a smooth, slightly woody bourbon sweetness. Theres a tannic, slightly sour (in a good way) quality that manifests near the finish.

The mouthfeel is super smooth. This brew goes down dangerously easy. There is a nice pleasant warmth in my chest and a bit of burn at the back of my throat.

What a wonderful brew and simply a pleasure to drink. Easily the best bourbon flavors Ive tasted in a brew. However, Id imagine the regular Pannepot has more overt complexity because barrel aging tends to dominate my palate.","","Lognar"

2861,"2013-06-30",3.3,"4 oz. served into a tasting snifter at ChurchKey. From notes; 2010 vintage.

A: Pours a dark ruby color. The head is little more than a thin khaki film. Still, its very stout-like in appearance.

S: There are some evident tones of nuts, dark fruits, oak, and spicing here, however its not nearly as evocative as I expected. What is here, at least, is well balanced and pleasurable.

T: The opening is mildly nutty and spicy. This will progress into a middle of earthy toffee, with a light oak finish. Solid complexity, but the flavors themselves arent blowing my mind.

M: Its medium bodied in texture. The alcohol (seemingly in typical De Struise fashion) is well concealed in spite of its (also seemingly in typical De Struise fashion) dry finish. Very drinkable, as well.

Cola brown pour, murky, minimal ring of tan bubbles. Taste - yum. A little tangy at the end, lots of chocolate and smoke. Full body, some carb, silky/syrupy texture. Long smoky chocolate sweet finish. Very nice treat.

2861,"2013-06-22",4.8,"Currently drinking whilst typing (2009 Reserva). WOW! The aroma is amazing and complex, full of deep rich raisin, dark forest fruits, cherry, port, sweet breadiness, sweet barrel aged alcohol notes. Pours as a dark brown vessel with a full tan coloured head towering above. A ridiculously complex taste completely steals the show, I would say the closest thing to a Westvleteren without a doubt. It is laden with rich dark sweet malts, raisin, cherry, fruity Belgian bready yeast, plum and a well disguised alcohol note with a warming character. Incredibly smooth and full bodied palate with very gentle carbonation and a long complex finish. Overall, this is a true goliath in the beer world, its near on perfect and the closest thing to a Westvleteren 12, obviously the two have very subtle differences but if you want a mind blowing yet affordable beer from one of the greatest breweries in the world; then look no further than the Pannepot Reserva!","Suffolk, ENGLAND","Storm_Warning"

2861,"2013-05-30",3.6,"330mL bottle from Belmont Station. 2010 vintage. Westvleteren goblet.

A: Fizzes up from the glass. Very dark mahogany to the point of nearly being black. Creamy head disintegrates into leftovers. Leaves some pretty nice legs.

N: Greeted by a cavalcade of walnuts, sweet malt, and oak. Theres a touch of molasses about this. Some cola and plenty of clove. Cinnamon, peppercorn and caramel. Very aromatic and pleasing if disjointed.

T: Heavy on the wood with a hint of savory flavors over the top of a bread sweetness. Tastes very exotic if a little overspice and almost funky. Shows some biting astringency. A little bit of soy sauce/salt.

M: Dense and full with lively carbonation. 

O: Id much prefer the base beer, the Monks Ale or the Grand Reserva. Though this beer is very well rounded, its almost got a wild element to it.  Disappointed, I admit.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

Moderate fruitiness with fig, cherry, raisin and stone fruit. Moderate phenolic spice note in the finish that blends nicely with the light alcohol spice. Medium light oak character with a nice sherry note. 
Medium to medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and moderate alcohol warmth. The beer is sweet but not sticky at all.

Beh! che dire se la 2009 era gia una branda la 2007 è stata una delle migliori birre che ho provato. Lunico difetto è che finisce. Non si presenta proprio bene. Un geyser di schiuma fuoriesce appena stappata. Fortuna che avevo messo il bicchiere sotto e tra la disperazione e un leggero stato confusionale sono riuscito a recuperare il prezioso nettare. Colore: come la 2009. Cosi come laroma forse un pò meglio legato e levigato grazie alla maturazione. Appena bevuta entri in un stato di trance e inizi gia a deprimerti perchè già sai che finirà prima o poi. Tra le tante (e stupende) note che si riescono a distinguere sono vaniglia, datteri, fichi, cioccolato. Il tannico e lalcol la rendono clomplessa quasi quanto un whisky.

It pours a deep clear brown with reddish tinge. The initial tan head gives quickly. The aroma is a rich sweet bread and yeast with very ripe dark fruit and a little nice oxidation. Its just a little more hot and full with fruit esters than the PGR and much richer than the standard. The aromas just keeps going and pulls you in. Flavor is the same with a some spice like cinnamon and clove taking hold in the middle and somewhat woody bitter end. Its moderately sweet but in incredible balance with.  Its just a little less heavy, rich, and warm than the PGR, must be the calvados and age.  The PGR at 7 years is less lively and has a dead yeast character (not off putting in the slightest).  This one is very luxurious with a lively creamy mouthfeel and warming, woody end.  This is a masterpiece to say the least. Its drinking perfectly right now.

It evokes figs, dark cherries, caramel, and apple cider up front and culminates with mellow, woody undertones. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk, with minor carbonation and a medium body. Otherworldly!","Texas, USA","AndresTM"
2861,"2012-12-22",4.6,"Bottle from the Bottle Shop, Canterbury 221212
Dark rich caramel brown, frothy off white head that dissipates to thin rime around glass, some lacing
Aroma - Very malty sweet, raisins, figs, dark fruits, some dark honey, sweet caramel malts,  touch of toffee, soft spices, some of that Belgian yeast, almost no booze, aromatic, reminds one of Rochefort 10, this is very complex
Taste as above with dark candy sugars, very complex, very malty, dark fruits, spices, touch of chocolate, soft sherry, complex yeast esters, only slight hint of booze, getting a touch of wood, very rich flavour
Palate - Medium carb, full body, sweet palate, very smooth. Finish as main flavour, smooth, very fruity and malty with some warming booze in the finish

There was caramel, molasses, maple syrup, brown sugar, prune, spices, yeast, cherry, raisin, wood, cherry pits, alcohol, vanilla, and slight chocolate and licorice when it became very warm.

2861,"2012-08-26",4.8,"Struise Pannepot Reserva 2009. Poured lightly chilled into a tulip glass 8/26/2012.

Pours a very dark brown. Very little light coming through. Great head, lasts a minute or two. 

Great smell, but not very aromatic initially. Smells of sugar and raisins so far.

Initial feel is a medium thickness. Very smooth. Almost non-existent alcohol feel. Incredible for a 10%. Nice carbonation.

Taste is complex. Picks up where the smell left off and enhances it, makes it more full. The sweetness of the beer cuts most of the bitterness. A little dry, but nicely so. More of the raisin taste, but its being overpowered by what I believe is figs. Almost a smokey taste. 

Afterthoughts: Beer disappeared quickly, as I was trying to distinguish the flavors. I wish I could be more helpful describing the taste, however, they were too well mixed and nothing stood out but the ones I mentioned (sugar, raisins/figs). Beautiful lacing; very fine. Not quite as heavy as other quads, but its most likely the best Ive tried. 

Next time, might try with a snifter to bring out the aroma more.

Aroma: 9 - Beautiful aroma, despite the faintness. (Could have just been me, as well.
Appearance: 4 - Wish the head had lasted longer, but the lacing was magical.

2861,"2012-08-13",3.8,"Poured into a snifter. 2008 vintage. Big thanks to SteveFinny for this.

3.5 A: Murky plum brown color. A good bit of sediment came out, much more than what would just be yeast. Short lived frothy beige head. Ill cut it some slack since its pretty old.

4.5 S: Great aroma on this. Tons of fruits, which are, in descending order - cherry, plum, more cherry, fig, date. Pleasant sugariness reminiscent of Pez candy. Plenty of caramel, candi sugar, and especially a ""generic"" spiciness. Light tobacco and raisin. This has an overarching earthy character, which I love in the Belgian quads. Lastly, oak to round things off.

4.0 T: The taste is also very good, but it lacks the power that the nose has. Oak is a bit more apparent in the taste. Otherwise, its quite similar to the nose, but with less sugariness and fruits and a bit more earth. Same fruits exist, just less force from each. Same tobacco and raisin. The Pez thing isnt found in the taste. More dirty earthiness exists though.

4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Good carbonation level, especially for this old. The carbonation could be a bit spritzier though, but overall its okay.

4.5 D: The taste was between a 4.0 and a 4.5 so Ill make up the difference here. Very good beer and probably the best variant. The Grand Reserva covers up too many flavors for me to prefer that.

Little bits of yeast chunks floating around in there, but thats only because Im rating the last 4 oz. that were in the bottle. Soft head sitting around the circumference of the glass, and on top of the beer, too. It looks fairly good. Lots of fig, and a soft plum aroma. The barrels provides a lovely oak and subtle vanilla aroma. The aroma further provides a raisin and grape aroma that are simply fantastic. Complimentary aromas are what makes this a strikingly pleasing beer to smell. Time has been good to this beer, carbonation wise. It still provides a soft carbonation, but its not to the level of being soda-like, which seems common amongst this still, when fresh. The flavor isnt as memorable as the aroma. The oak and vanilla play well with one another. Then a, somewhat, lasting grape, fig, and raisin aroma hover on my taste buds. I was looking for this to make more of an impression, flavor wise, but it just didnt seem to peak. Still, a wonderfully delicious beer, worthy of the praise.

A: Murky thick dark brown body with almost no head on top, just a thin tan ring.

S: This is very complex and strong. Oak, brown sugar, figs, chocolate and some mild alcohol. Its hard to put a finger on the aroma and I expect more will appear as it sits more and I sip more.

T: Candied and brown sugar make up the intro into a grape and fig wine-like mid-taste that is accented by mild oak, chocolate and caramel. Wow. The finish has some oak on it with a touch of alcohol and a cloves spice that gives a nice spicy finish. This is a fantastic beer!

M: Very thick, slightly syrupy, with very light carbonation.

En øl jeg længe har set frem til at smage, men aldrig har fået købt. Fredag aften skulle være den store aften, og jeg fik den smagt, men noterne gik tabt. Jeg prøver at vurdere den her, ud fra hukommelsen: Pannepot Reserva ligner ikke noget usædvanligt. Vi taler om en meget mørkebrun øl, med et meget middelmådigt skum. Duften understreger kvaliteten, men ikke så mange detaljer som jeg havde håbet på. Der er ubestemmeligt krydderi, træ(!) og alkohol. Måske en smule karamel eller sukker. Smagen er en anelse sødere og især blommer  og brun faring / karamel træder tydeligt igennem, i mindre grad sammen med træ og krydderier samt humle. En del alkohol og bitterhed, som er godt balanceret med resten af øllen. Der er desværre også en smule metal til stede. En god tyngde og tykkelse i denne øl.

A - Dark brown/rusty red body. Small off white head which resided to some edging. Moderate lacing.

S - Figs, candi sugar, caramel, yeast and spice. Faint vanilla. Some notes towards the end that are charred and woody, but rubbery and plasticy. Oddly enough it works. Really smooth and robust.

Vanilla, figs, candi sugar, Belgian yeast and a handful of spices. Some light metallic and medicinal flavors floating around. Really complex. Extremely smooth mouth feel and light carbonation makes it an easy drinking quad. Light alcohol flavors as it begins to warm up.

Flavor is big on dark fruit, chocolate, sweet white bread crust, dates, woody oak notes, sweet cherries, light fusel notes and dark caramel. Toward the finish comes earth and last years dry leaves. As it warms coffee and more dark fruit comes out along with slightly stronger fusel notes, no enough to be off putting, but they are somewhat noticeable. Palate is medium-heavy and creamy on the entry with an off dry finish and light, velvety carbonation. It never really feels too far toward any extreme in the range of mouthfeel description.

2861,"2011-03-30",3.9,"33cl bottle picked up from the web shop. 2008 vintage appropriately served in a De Struise glass... A dark hued copper with hints of amber, slightly see through, a little darker than Pannepot. The head is a light tan, only rises a couple fingers, not much especially for a De Struise glass pour. Good retention and lacing though... The aroma is surprisingly restrained for an oaked version of Pannepot, Pannepot seems to have stronger and sweeter quad notes. Typical quad notes of dark fruits, figs, and raisins are there but they come off a touch sterile, metallic, chemical. I dont get any nice caramel or candi sugar or oak. Sterile figs with alcohol. Im sadly not loving this... The taste is much better as it really brings out dried figs and raisins, subtle oak, and some molasses. Very tastey and drinkable. However, the mouthfeel is super light, especially compared to the base beer. Incredibly crushable 10%.

This is still a very good quad, just slightly disappointed in the nose and mouthfeel. I bought a dozen of these so hopefully they get better in time.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

2861,"2011-03-15",4.6,"11.2 oz bottle. Reserva, 2008 vintage, No4.

It is a beaut when it pours. It is black in the snifter with a plum purple/red colored hue when held to light. The head is off-white and tightly foamed. It sticks for a bit and recedes to a few spots of lacing.

The smell is full-force. It is HUGE and filled primarily with raisins, kirschwasser, almond extract, perfumey alcohol, brown sugar, vanilla, oak, and spice.

The flavor is much the same, just a really flavorful quad. It has tons of dark fruit flavors, caramel, toffee, dark bread, and dark candi sugar. There is also a hint of spiciness but nto really too much oak as there was in the smell. It is medium-full bodied with a prickling carbonation, an alcoholic tinge, and a dry finish. It is sweet, but not overly so, it is smooth and drinkable

A foamy tan head sits on top. The nose packs a punch - candy sugar and bubblegum are dominant, with raisins, figs, plums, and caramel assisting and a hint of musty oak alongside. The flavor is less sugar-dominated and carries through more of the fruity, malty tones - raisins, chocolate brownies, dark cherries, plums. Finishes smooth, rich, and velvety with a little hint of tannins. The palate is smooth as butter the whole way through - perfect carbonation on this one. The head is quite persistent, especially considering its lower carbonation level. All in all, this beer satisfies nearly every whim a beer drinker could dream up. Regular Pannepot is great, too.

Very little head that disappears to just some specks. Still-looking. Aroma is fairly mild but has notes of fruit (cherry/plum), chocolate, port and burgundy. Served a little too cold to get a good sense of the aroma. Mouthfeel is heavy and smooth, very light evidence of carbonation. Very little lacing. Flavor of dark fruits, chocolate and burgundy with some swirls of caramel as it warmed. Has the oak aging damped out much of the flavor and nuance I remember from regular Pannepot, along with the body, or did I just get an odd glass? At its best this sample reminded me of something like Southampton Abt 12 but then the next quaff reminded me of something like a flat Angels Share.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"

The taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like brown sugar, dark fruit, molasses, oak, apples, clove, caramel and bready malt.

2861,"2010-12-10",3.0,"Bottle 2008: Pours cloudy brown (and I did let it sit for 2 days). Smells phenolic with bark and treacle notes. Well blow me that didnt taste anything like I thought it would. No taste-bud assault here; instead, its really mellow.  It has a syrupy body with a very low level of bitterness. Theres a sort of pine-resin and raisin flavour underpinning it with a slightly sour watery soy-sauce bite on the finish. If this were a UK beer I guess it would be an Old Ale.

The yeast gives a slightly tart note with distinctly Belgian flavors.  The chocolate malts and coffee are less noticeable in the taste than in the aroma.  Alcohol is slightly noticeable in the aftertaste, but it is still very smooth.  A few spices in the aftertaste as well, as if this beer couldnt get more complex.

Dark brown with a medium-sized beige head that settles into a persistent slick of foam.   Rich dried fruit aroma with a very aged, dry, almost syrupy quality.   Lightly spiced underneath that, but its hard to tell with what, which is how I like it.   A light touch of butter once things warm up, which could be diacetyl or could be the oak, and Im guessing its the oak.   Adds a really nice richness actually.   There is brighter than dried fruit wuality as well, though it is well integrated and reminds me a bit of cooked apple and peach.   The flavor is rich and sweet with a spicy fruitcake quality and a touch of burnt molasses.   Hardly and alcohol shows, and this is way too easy to drink, drying out just slightly in the finish and not leaving uncomfortable sweetness behind.   Oak is slightly noticeable in the finish, but is subtle overall.    Full bodied with medium but very fine carbonation.   A very nice beer on the whole.

In the mouth is initially fruity with a prominent caramel sweetness that rides all the way through, moving into plums, cherry and chocolate with over-ripened fruit on the swallow along with some lingering bitter chocolate and some spice like cloves.  The more sips i take, the more refined it becomes, mellowing out into a beautifully balanced belgian and leaving me feeling the 10%. Finished this ne off with a cuesta rey #95 in my hand.

Rich dark fruity flavors consising of prunes, plums, raisins and dates.  Theres a slight cherry tart in there but it stays very much in the background.  Plenty of dried fruit sweetness.  The oak, and some vanilla shows too, smooths this out and adds complexity.  Theres some soothing alcohol in the finish with the addition of spices that tastes like it belongs.  Excellent beer.

A - Very dark brown/black cola color with a large, extraordinarily creamy, sticky, frothy beige head. Good retention that settles into a nice layer of creamy, sticky lace.

S - Lots of dark fruit with raisin, date, plum, and cherry aroma. Good amount of dark, caramel malt and molasses/slightly burnt brown sugar. Hints of chocolate and some oaky/vanilla aroma along with a strong spiced aroma and some yeast.

T - Similar to the nose with a good mixture of sweet malt and dark fruit with a good amount oak and spice. These make a good combination of all different taste. Molasses, caramel, and hints of chocolate come out with the malt. Similar dark fruit to the nose combines sweet and slightly tart flavor. Good amount of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and coriander are present. Slight oak and vanilla undertones are present throughout. No overly strong but definitely provide another layer of flavor. Very well balanced and complex beer.

D - Very easy to drink with the smooth and creamy body and the nice balance and complexity. Really makes me want to keep drinking this.

Spiced aroma with some star anise, mocha, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice. Opaque black under a thin, light brown sheet that laces the glass.

2861,"2010-01-11",4.2,"2006 vintage.

Dark reddish brown with a medium-sized pale beige head. Good head retention and nice lacings.

Deep and rich malty aromas. Lots of fruity notes (cherries, plums, figs, currants) - this is like a fruit basket! Tagging along the fruits are notes of wood, cola and chocolaty fudge, and wonderful caramel notes. Very vinous. Some spicy yeast. Very complex, almost overwhelming.

At first, the taste is very reminiscent of red wine- fruity notes, wood, earth and spices make for one vinous experience. After a few sips, things get easier to sort out and the red wine character decreases to some extent. Some malts, but not very powerful. Lovely balance of sweet caramel, fudge, and notes of ripe dark fruits (but not as complex as in the smell). Dry woody notes linger on, Belgian yeast, spices and earth. The sweetness is balanced by a gentle tart note that sticks around to the finish. The finish is mildly bitter with notes of well integrated warming alcohol, currants, wood, mild phenols and hints of iron. Beautiful and rich, very well balanced.

Surprisingly light body with rather high levels of carbonation. The mouthfeel definitely makes the beer dangerously easy to drink.

All in all, very good, better than the Grand Reserva version.

I was expecting this to be much more about the barrel.  Still overall pretty sweet, but not so much as the regular.  Pretty full bodied with a bit of sticky caramel, but it seems like this is a little thinned by the alcohol.  A little too much overly fizzy and frothy carbonation keeps this from being better.

2861,"2009-09-05",4.4,"A careful pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a three finger thick, lightly amber tinged, tan colored head that forms a fluffy, textured surface and leaves lots of lace on the sides of the glass as it slowly subsides.  The aroma smells of tart raisins, prunes and figs that lie on top of a dense, toasted grain, molasses spice cake note.  Hints of spicy and toasted oak character lightly scent the beer, but play a subdued role in the nose.  There are also red wine like notes (rich, tannic berry notes) and a concentrated tamarind note.  Once you dig around and explore enough here you notice a funky, musty mushroom note that becomes noticeable in the finish; it reminds me a bit of a musky blankey that has is scented with dried sweat.  Other aromatic notes of light chocolate, earthy coriander, cherry pits, and quite a fully malty note are noticeable here as well; this last contributes a dark toasted, though not roasted, deeply caramelized, and brown malt character.  The concentrated fruit and malt in the nose take on a sort of smoky quality at times.  The nose on this beer is incredibly complex, it is very intriguing and worth exploring in detail.

The beer is full bodied as it first hits my tongue, but has a prickly effervescent carbonation that struggles free of the viscous heft.  The beer tastes lightly sweet, but is still significantly savory.  The beer has a sort of has a dark honey flavor to it, but without that cloying sweetness that honey has.  Notes of molasses, tart-concentrated fruit (prune and fig as well as a touch of raisin that seems to get a bit bigger as the beer warms) and some dark cocoa notes in the finish start to come out after a couple sips.  This is quite rich and satiating, but not overly sweet; in fact the tart and sweet notes are in such a good balance that neither is overtly noticeable.  The malt character is concentrated and brooding with lots of Maillard browning flavors, a molasses character, some notes of dark caramel, savory complex sugars, plus some toasted / caramelized dark bread crust flavors.  There is a nice spiciness here that, again, is not a note that is overtly noticeable; it provides a touch of clove flavor, earthy coriander notes, an oaky spiciness (this is the most noticeable spice note, but still is fairly subtle), a touch of ginger, a peppery piquancy in the finish, a richly integrated anise note (though more like one that has been cooked for a long time), a definite note of mahleb (if you consider this a spice), mellow vanilla, hints of mace and a wisp of cardamom.

This is possibly the most balanced strong beer I have ever had; this shows a finesse that is rarely achieved, it has a melding of sweet & tart, malt / fruit & spice, oak & base beer as well as earthy & bright notes.  Definitely a tour de force, it takes what can be a phenomenal base beer and adds a couple more layers, as well as a melding process that integrates everything together as a whole.  I like that this has lost the sweetness of the base beer (though even the 2006 Pannepot I had last night was not aggressively sweet).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2861,"2009-09-04",3.0,"2006 bottle. It tastes overly sour and basicaly like an amateurish microbrewerys first attempt with using brett. All things considered, it is very smooth for 10% alcohol.

2861,"2009-08-06",4.5,"The Pannepot Reserva 2005 is a Belgian Ale brewed with spices and aged in oak barrels. In that description alone, there were at least 4 buzz words that make me weak in the knees and set my heart aflutter. Enough blathering, time to get down to business. Or is it pleasure? Or both?


She came to me one lonely afternoon in a translucent brown dress with fringes of hay and a soft collar made of cottony whites. As she holds me in her embrace, her exotic perfume woos with lightly sweet and exquisitely spiced esters. Toasted raisin bread, butter, and cinnamon sugar while maple syrup, brown sugar, and gourmet turtles replete with nuts offer a helping hand. As we dance into the night, our lips are soon drawn together in a show-stopping kiss which leaves me floating on air while her essence lingers long on my lips. Warmth almost immediately starts to permeate my body while cinnamon and raisin bread wait for a drizzle of maple syrup. Each kiss is sweet, warm, and lightly spiced. Faint esters of candied apples with their soft outer sweetness and crunchy apply insides transport me to an olden farmers market where natures bounty is celebrated. Our time together cannot last forever; I know this and yet I do not want to admit it. As I bid farewell to my Pannepot Reserva 2005, she leaves me with one last gift of remembrance, dark breads and fruits steeped in spiced rummy oak. Ascendance is nigh.


As you can tell by the year of this particular Pannepot, she ages with grace and aplomb so I will be sure to set aside a few bottles for the years to come when I am finally able to acquire some. If you should be somewhere, anywhere, and have an opportunity to take this beer home with you, please do. Trust me. You will not regret it.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Im also detecting a cognac-like flavor hiding in the background. Very complex. The mouthfeel is simply perfect: Thick and velvety. As soon as I completed the first sip I truly said to myself, ""Thats so Struise"", in reference to the velvety mouthfeel and finish.

2861,"2009-06-01",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
Berries meet peppery spiciness and lenient licorice, before moderate alcohol heat and oaken dryness conclude this elegant sipper of a Belgian Strong Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A frothy head of foam covers the dark mahogany.
-I found this one to be less spicy and sweet than the regular Pannepot and not as fruity and vinous as the Grand Reserva.
-The nose was redolent of BBQ spices at times.
-Tiny bubbles build a lively mouthfeel, increasing drinkability.
-Some roasted malts appear in there at times, and cola-like notes spring from the sweet spiciness.

It smells so good it took me several minutes to take my nose out of the glass to take a sip. The flavor is sweetish at first with raisin, rum, brown sugar, and some sticky prune juice notes. But through the mouth it picks up a faint tartness that cuts the sweetness beautifully. A distinct sharp oak quality develops as well and really does bring the flavors together. The finish and aftertaste are dry and just a touch spicy with residual oakiness lingering far into the dry-ish aftertaste. Very complex and perfectly balanced. This beer is amazing. I want more!","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

The flavor was full of rich dark fruits, chocolate, grapes, apples, spicing, floral character, full sawdusty oak. The 10+% alcohol was quite smooth.

2861,"2009-03-07",4.1,"2005 vintage, consumed March 2009.  As I popped the cap, the cork slowly started to creep out of the bottle neck on its own accord.  Sensing an impending eruption, I swept in with a waiters tool to ease the stopper out under control.  A loud pop confirmed that this was indeed a well carbonated bottle, though, thankfully, no foaming ensued.  The pour yields a dark and dense, cloudy, mauve colored body that is crowned with a large and well retained head of creamy, khaki colored foam.   Dense, solid sheets of lacing coat the glass almost entirely.  Aromas are of stewed raisins and figs, with dark caramel notes and hints of light cocoa in the malt base.  Candied orange peel and dark, earthen, wintery spices lend significant balance to the dark, fruity sweetness.  Flavors follow suit, a bevy of dark, concentrated fruits showing strong, with raisin and fig being the dominant components.  Anise and cocoa are accompanied by heaps of oak and vanilla, which really ties everything together nicely.  The spicing is again quite earthy, potent, yet appropriate for this brew.  Substantially bodied with above average carbonation activity, the mouthfeel is round up front, transitioning quickly to fizzy and semi-dry on the finish.  This is an excellent beer.  Not quite as masterful as the original Pannepot, but more impressive than both the Danish version and the Grande Reserva.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Aroma has a wonderful mix of dark fruit, gentle oak and vanilla, light spice, and a nice brown sugar mix that all goes into the nostrils like an angel.  Flavor is a smooth and hearty mix of brown sugar, vinous fruits, tangy spices, and a good amount of oak.  Mouthfeel is superb and seems to last forever.  Wow - Ive been a pannepot fan for awhile, but always felt that the spices and sugar were a tad disjointed.  This pulls it all together and becomes my favorite Belgian beer of all time, and one of the best brews ever - hands down.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
2861,"2009-02-22",4.1,"750mL bottle, 2005 vintage, poured into a snifter.

The cork popped out loudly on this one and pours dark brown out of the bottle and settles in an opaque near-black that is a deep, clear copper when held up to the light.  The head is massive, cream-colored and very rocky on the bottom with tons of carbonation feeding the head throughout.

Aroma is very sweet with tons of candi sugar and dark fruits, raisins, grapes, plums, etc.  Has a cola-ish aroma to it with hints of the wood that leads to a sherry scent overall.

The has the same candi sugar up front with some sweet dark fruit with a bit of sourness to them, just a touch.  I agree with others that the wood seems to have smoothed the taste a bit and minimized some of the huge complexities that I really enjoy in the original.  The booze and wood is definitely present in the finish, leaving a burn going down.

The mouthfeel is velvety smooth and medium bodied with lots of carbonation.  Its definitely slightly drier than the original with a bit more wood presence.

Needless to say, this is a great beer, and the wood presence is subtle but makes it a different beer from the original.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Lovely aroma - stellar, just what I would hope for from any Pannepot - a lush melange of yeast, spice, sweet fruity malt, mild tartness and alcohol - nothing out of the ordinary, but done so, so well.  The taste was ... a bit thin;  frankly, this hasn’t aged as well as I’d like - the yeast and malt seemed to have pulled apart some.  The body seemed a little wan, and I was surprised how the alcohol had started to overpower the malt and spice ... it seemed a bit on the overcarbonated side too, but at least the finish was decently sweet.

Red wine, spice and raisins in the aroma.

High carbonation yet quite rich - but not thick nor cloying in any way. Brown sugar spice on the finish.

Very nice beer. Side by side with the regular Pannepot, this beer is just not quite as good. Is this a great beer? Yes. But, the oak aging seems to take a little away from the base beer while making the flavors conflict ever so slightly - although, this beer is also slightly more complex than the base beer as well.

In long: Just like the regular Pannepot this one has a strong candy feeling.   Crisp sweet red liquorice wrapped around dried fruits of all kinds.  Big heavy trappist-like malted and yeasty body.  Some spicy hard candies in there too.   Barrel aging did change the taste but I didnt get much wood/barrel in the taste if any at all.  Seemed crisper with a stronger spiciness sensation than the regular Pannepot.  Also present was a little sweet Sherry wine flavour and a much welcomed light cherry sourness.  Dont know which one I prefer, Im rating this one higher right now but Im due for a Pannepot re-rate since I like it more and more very time.  Thanks again to Nelson for opening your cooler in exchange for floor-space at my hotel room.  That was an excellent deal to me, usually people who offers beers like that dont ask to sleep on the floor, they ask to sleep in my bed and do dirty things to me and I say yes :(","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

One of my favorites out of the many epic beers we tried that evening. The oak presence adds a nice layer of complexity to this already amazing concoction. Hazy burgundy color with a big light brown head and bubbles. Looks appetizing. Great aroma of toasty Belgian yeast, plum and raisin with lots of wood in the background. Flavors are similar to regular Pannepot, with toffee, more raisin, chocolate and cinnamon. The oak aging slides a subtle woody character into the finish, rounding out the bitterness and resulting in a ""wow"" feeling with each sip. It still has that tingly, soothing mouth feel as well.

2861,"2007-12-24",4.5,"I found this jewel at the Delirium Café while in Brussels. It was a 750ml bottle and was poured into a chalice glass.

A: It has a very dark body with high visible carbonation. Topping the body is a very thick off-white head that is continuously replenished by the carbonation allowing it to last a long time.

S: The aroma is pretty yeasty with caramel and sherry or bourbon notes. It was a bit yeasty for me personally but still very inviting.

F: The flavor makes it very obvious that this is an oaked beer. It starts initially with a good malty sweet flavor with hints of caramel and then a rush of vanilla oakiness develops and takes over. It leaves a bitter almost acidic feeling in the back of my mouth, possibly from the alcohol. As it warms up, the oak smoothes out and becomes a nicely complimenting flavor.

M: I was surprised at the mouthfeel of this beer, being only medium in body. I had expected it to be a bit heavier but it was very nice.

D: This is a great beer, although possibly not quite as good as the regular Pannepot. It is definitely one to try given the chance though.","Troy, New York, USA","drseamus"
2861,"2007-12-13",4.1,"From a 750mL Bottle.  Generously shared by CaptainCougar, courtesy of boboski.  Pours a somewhat transparent, deep dark brown color with a tall layer of fizzy head that fizzles out flat a bit quickly.  The aroma has a distinct oaky dryness that boldly lurks over the rich backbone of molasses and gingerbread cookie malt characters.  A lot of really lovely things going on, but most of them I can attribute to the wonderful beer existing in the pre-oak stage.  Theres still some of that lightly toasted fennel seed, fig spice, and tobacco leaf notes tantalizing the senses, but the big vanilla oakiness is overwhelming some of the more subtle nuances a bit too much.  Medium bodied, sparkling mouthfeel with a crisp effervescence.  Lightly sweet, smokey caramel-toffee melanoidins start out the flavors, followed by a wave of oak and vanilla.  Toasted brown sugar and flambeed pecans.  Unfortunately, Im enjoying the pre-oak flavors more than the oak, although that isnt to say the oak is unpleasant - the original is just too damn amazing and complex to have such a bold dimension added to the mix.  But realistically, how could this have been a disappointment at all from such a high starting point?  Another fantastic beer from an amazing brewer.  Thanks for sharing, Tom!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
2861,"2007-12-12",3.9,"750 ml bottle - Columbus X tasting
Thanks to whomever brought this - I believe it was moejuck.  Knowing this was a Top 50 beer I was eager to give it a try despite being letdown just a bit by regular Pannepot.  It was still a fantastic beer; it just does not knock my socks off enough to deserve Top 50 status (perhaps Top 100 is more accurate).  This one is about the same.  I would gladly drink it again for being an excellently made beer but in a pinch would take the regular release instead.
Aroma / Appearance - Oak, toffee, chocolate and plum form a cohesive set of scents.  A woody backbone holds it all together.  If I close my eyes I almost can imagine turkey and dressing - perhaps this would be a good beer to open at Thanksgiving if it were more readily accessible.  The deep brown body was the color of liquid toffee.  Gooey lacing stuck to the sides of my glass along with an ashen lacing.
Flavor / Palate - The first sip was mostly vinous with hints of toffee and chocolate pudding along for the ride.  For such a complex beer it was very easy going and light on the palate.  I found it just a hair more boring than regular Pannepot which is to say that given the ability I would rate it about .05 points lower.  The only real proof that this has some punch comes towards the end when the alcoholic presence kicks in.  Overall another well made beer from Struisse that I hope to see on the shelves in the US some time.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Some phenols as well as more esters develop as it warms- fruity and hints of vanilla phenol and earthy almost plasticy as well- sweetness is a bit more subdued from the barrel and isnt as sharp as the regular- good amount of oak and vanilla but not overdone so it isnt woody or too earthy.  Some carmel and molasses sweetness throughout with a smooth light finish- some alcohol hints as it warms.  Nice overall, but It wasnt mind blowing.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

Pours a dark brown and purple with a really attractive pillowy tan head, building tall and then collapsing into crevases and mountains, with clingy, sticky lacing.  Nose is a plum port and oak note first, then some moderately strong alcohol, some whiskey and some sweet pipe tobacco.  Palate is creamy, flavor up front is smoky, with a bite of sharp plum flavored pipe tobacco.  Wonderfully complex, but somehow its missing the wow factor that maybe is due to this being highly rated and my expectations being really high.  Heavy chocolate and banana are noticed when it warms, as well as some tart cranberry and cherry pits. The sweetness of the Pannepot is surely there - I really like that the oak is mellow and complimentory, not overpowering, but I guess I should expect this from a brewer who seems to do everything right.  Fantastic stuff.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Comments: A ridiculously complex beer, thick, spicy with extreme sweetness and pure yeast decadence. I recognize the subtlety in the barrel flavour impartition, but it felt almost futile to a Pannepot. I cant say I found it greater. If anything, it felt a bit more alcoholic, of course woodsier and I found it more caramel focused. Less naturally spicy, but just as gorgeously fruity. Anyway, both are world-class and I cant imagine anyone who enjoys one and does not the other. A must.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2861,"2007-10-11",4.7,"Top fermented, unfiltered, unpasteurized, bottle refermented. 10 vol% strong.
Uncorking the plastic cork (a good thing - who needs cork taste in his beer anyway) gave a nice plop-sound.
Carbonation was just perfect. Immediately some flowery-estery aromas filled the room and lucky my nose too. This is a  good sign already!
Pouring gave a dark to black, quite dense liquid, producing some fine creamy beige colored foam.
A head that evolved into some 1cm. thick creamy layer. Perfect foam retention.
Smelling revealed alot of spices. I notice flowery-estery perfumes too. Roasty malts, perfect hoppiness and some winy touches. The ""winy"" resemblances with Oerbier Réserva were remarkable.
Smelling was a treat already, but tasting , well this brings you straight into beer heaven !
What an amazing texture. Dense, full-body as it should be. The creaminess is astounding.
First thing I noticed was that this beer is less sweet than the regular Pannepot. Oak ageing has clearly diminished some sugars here.
Ive tasted vanilla, cinnamon, liquorice, roasty malts, tannins (oak barrels), candi sugar, other spices (nutmeg?), fruity-flowery esters (makes it refreshing at the same time), warming alkohol.
Very nice about this beer is the creamy texture. Really exceptional and a wonderful treat for the taster in question.
Now, its only waiting to taste the Pannepot Grand Réserva which underwent an additional 8 months of Calvados barrel ageing. Makes it a total of 22 months of barrel ageing. Amazing at least !!!!","BELGIUM","Trappistenbier"

2861,"2007-08-02",4.3,"2005. Thick, somewhat fizzy light beige head, slow to fade. Sheet lacing with irregular holey patches. At first glimpse the body looks black. Closer inspection reveals a bold though extremely dark chestnut color with mahogany fiery crimson and Autumn orange hues. The aroma is gorgeous. Its immediately, unmistakably evident that Pannepot is the base beer, but there are stark contrasts. The powerful spice notes of the unoaked version are softened, refined and melded into a wintry concoction. Heavy barrel notes lead the procession. Following is vanilla, soft sweet cherries, passion fruit, hefty licorice, coriander, strawberry, caramel and sugar. Faint hints from the barrel and spice combinations elude to the wonders of Islay Sctoch, specifically a vivid recollection of my last sip of Caol Ila. Pumpkinseed sneaks in for a brief moment. Almost zero alcohol is evident. This appears to be a marvelous result of just the right amount of barrel aging. Oh, how I adore what French Oak does to flavors in alcoholic beverages, of all sorts. What a nose; I think Pannepotpourri would be a better name for this. Alcohol shines through moderately to heavily in the flavor. Spice notes are now laden with pepper. The oak barrel taste is very lightly tannic, delicate but everpresent. Caramel is plentiful and lends to a sweetness that verifies the young age. This isnt as sweet as a fresh, unoaked bottle is but has copious chocolate and vanilla. Viscosity is very high even though the body is still relatively large and sticky. The mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate carbonation(or heavy carbonation that is velvety). In a divergence from the original version, this beer seems thinned somewhat from a stay so long in the barrel; there are, however, no heavy tannins, noticeable oxidation or any off flavors. The finish is balanced, erring on the sweet side, with lingering candy notes. Not as exciting as the original, though if that changes after this sits in the bottle awhile I wouldt be the least bit surprised. That wishful thinking will warrant at least a few revisits. Oh, darn.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
2861,"2007-08-01",4.3,"#700!!  Huge thanks to hopscotch for sharing this rare gem!!  Pours a dark caramel brown, with a thin, but well-retained light brown head.  Smells of sweet dark malts, a little bit of dark fruit, oak, a little spice, and a little funk too.  Very big flavor right up front, sweet carmael, dark berries and other fruits, maybe some apple.  The oak is definitely present as well, and blends in pretty well with the other flavors.  There is a noticeable little funk taste in there too which gave it its unique character over the regular Pannepot.  Pretty crazy flavor, up in your face, but the alcohol is masked quite well.  I get a little heat in the finish, but nothing highly evident.  A little fruity finish and oaky aftertaste.  I think I liked the regular Pannepot better, but this was very good too.  Thanks again Eric!!","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
2861,"2007-07-19",5.0,"This is an incredible beer.  The aroma has light alcohol, but much more.  There is sweet fruit, cinnamon, malt sweetness, yeast, and oak, as well as some brown sugar and light spices I cant identify.  It has a very dark brown appearance, and is very thick like syrup, the palate is quite exceptional.  The flavor has a little oak, and this is just a hair drier than the regular Pannepot.  There is also a light roasted character.  Very much like a malty Trappist ale, comparable to Achel or Westvleteren in the malt character.  There are light spices, and I do perceive the cardamom now that I know it is there.  It takes a long time just to drink a little bit of this, as it is very thick, heavy, smooth, and complex.

Quite full-bodied, slightly foamy-carbonated and sticky palate. I have to say, that this is very sweet, and its almost hard to finish a half of the 0.75l bottle. On the other hand, it is a very good and enjoyable beer. Oak/calvados aging has not affected the flavor that much (not like in Calva Reserva, for example), but certainly theres some extra complexity in the form of oaky vanilla etc. Anyway, the basis was already a world-class brew, so...

Aroma was similar to regular Pannepot, but with a very balanced oaky presence.  The aroma was a little less overwhelmingly spicy and more balanced than Pannepot, a perfect 10.

Draught at ZBF. My last beer of the festival on the Saturday and more than fitting to roll up our 1000th rate. Sim and I shared this on the train back to Antwerp accompanied by Mads who was fittingly drinking an Aardnon if I remember correctly. Almost stouty character. Alcohol is a little more pronounced or is that just my imagination? Nope it definitely is. Much more chocolate than the regular and almost gone are the liquorice and candi sugar. The oak is very clear and gives it a superb earthyness missing from Pannepot. Considering its strength being clearly apparent it is gloriously mellow and dare I say it, downable.
