3766,"2013-07-08",2.3,"In short: A problematic bottle sad.
How: Bottle 750ml, red waxed top, 2012 vintage, consumed 10 months after the beer release, bottle sent to me by dougofthepast, thanks a lot Doug.
The look: Partly cloudy copper body topped by a persistent small beige head.
In long: Nose is woody, ripe red fruits, ripe bananas, a bit of an (unexpected) Flemish Sour thing going on here. Body is full and soft with lots of soft bubbles. Taste is problematic, toasted wheat, ripe bananas peels, awkward undesired lacto-like funk, light sourness, oaky notes. Obviously there was an infection developing here. Funny thing is, it wasnt entirely bad, could almost pass as a semi-wild semi-sour experimental wheat based dark beer. I didnt like it but my wife liked it (for what its worth). A quick glimpse at the ratings so far and it looks like Im the only one who got an infected bottle, well thats just my luck. Nobody else seem to complain about infection with this beer, thats just my luck, I should buy a funeral home business because that means science will suddenly find a cure for everything.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3766,"2013-03-27",3.6,"Dusky orange/amber pour. Nose is caramel, vanilla and maybe a hint of wood. Taste is on the sweet end, some nice alcohol character, some yeast notes, a hint of wood - refreshing for a barrel aged beer. Nice.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
3766,"2013-02-22",3.7,"On tap at Town Hall Brewery, pours a very muddy orange color with a white head. Scent is some wood, vanilla and almost an amaretto like scent. Taste is very similar, sweetness really comes through, barrel in the back, a roasted caramel finish, decent.

Medium-bodied with soft carbonation. The flavor is mostly bourbon and caramel, but also offers a tinge of acidity. Finishes tangy and bourbony with a rich, buttery, toffee farewell.

Aroma contains prominent banana and dried plum, sweet bread, coconut, the barrel treatment takes on a vinous quality, like aged red wine.  Taste is more traditional, dried fruit with caramel malts, toffee and vanilla, sweet bourbon but still with a subtle tartness which gives a special character.  Medium palate that remains smooth, with boozy kick above its stated ABV, but very drinkable.  Wow, this was pretty special.","New York, USA","jbeatty"
3766,"2012-03-24",4.2,"Bottle through trade thanks to Matt! Pour has a light brown amber color with a thin showing of off white head that fell right away. Aroma has some initial heat, malt, sweet bourbon, vanilla, oak, caramel, and some banana (after reading the ratings). Mouth feel is on the heavy side of medium and there is plenty of carbonation for a barrel aged beer. Flavor has sweet bourbon, vanilla, caramel, underlying malt, and a heated snap on the finish. The base beer and the barrel get along extremely well and even though it was a bit hot at first once it opened up it is quite pleasant and surprisingly easy to drink. This reminds me a bit of Founders Backwoods Bastard.","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"

3766,"2012-02-21",4.3,"On tap at the February 20th release at Town Hall in a 10 oz. goblet. Should have been much larger!

Pours darker than expected, warm oak in color, heady. The smell is the beers weakest aspect, tough to pick much off the surface of the brew, maybe vanilla, light spices.

Buffalo Bocks taste certainly does not fall into the weak category. The base beers bananas & cloves are strong, & there are healthy notes of caramel & vanilla. The bourbon in my first glass was repped by the vanilla; in the second, there was a stronger presence on its own. Incredibly smooth drinking, went in for one glass, split a second with my wife, & could have happily had more.

This was the beer I was least looking forward to during 2012 Barrel-Aged week, & its simply marvelous. Wish theyd have had the base weizenbock on to compare it against (they did earlier this week), that would have been fun. Excellent beer, sorry I didnt capture a bottle of this for myself.","Minnesota, USA","maximum12"

Caramel, apple, slight spice, vanilla all in the nose. The Bourbon is there too but not overbearing. Sweet caramel not transitions to a slightly hot booze note but doesnt overpower that much, will be nice to see this settle in the bottle for a while and smooth out. This was my least anticipated barrel release from town hall and Im really surprised how well I like it. Medium mouthfeel.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
