2938,"2017-03-19",3.9,"Bottle from Earth Fare- Great lacing and head. Barnyard and apple nose. Taste is a very pleasant sour with mild hint of sweet at the end. Doesnt feel oily or slick, but is slightly fizzy","USA","svandyke"
2938,"2017-03-03",3.9,"It clear golden with a white head. The aroma has tart apples, hay, wood and rustic heavy. It has a medium crisp body with lively carbonation. The taste has a bit more bite than the aroma with some acidity and tartness. Very rustic cider. Excellent.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
2938,"2016-12-21",4.0,"Bottle. Medium yellow, decent carb. Aroma is loads of funk, apple, apple peal, slight pear, hint of cottage cheese. Flavor is a match. Enjoyable stuff, good balance between tart, dry, sweet, fruit, and funk. Liked it bunches. Suspect I will never see this again for some reason.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
2938,"2016-10-24",3.8,"Bottle:
Bubbly, clear gold with an active and quick white head.
Old, basement-stored apple aroma.
Taste is sweet, aged, mushy apple....old hay...
Funkier nose than taste....
Very tasty.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
2938,"2016-09-30",3.7,"Bottle. Musty hay and apple juice aroma. Hazy golden yellow with giant but short lasting head and strong effervescence. Mildly sweet apple juice and mildly bitter musty hay flavor. Good body. Not very dry. Pleasant.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
2938,"2016-08-07",3.6,"Apple must and perfume with game-y/farm-y mallic acid touches. Light-bodied, sweet, carbonic, and juicy with a pleasant balance of acid and sugar, finishing tart. Simple, rustic, and beautiful, easy and refreshing.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
2938,"2016-04-26",3.8,"750 ml bottle cork and caged from Whole Foods. Very nice funky nose. Taste is light apple, saison, and brett. The brett really does it for me.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
2938,"2016-03-10",3.8,"Refrigerated 75 cl green bottle poured into a snifter. Hazy golden with small white head. Aroma is nice rich cider, medium body, medium carbonation, and a little lacing. Taste is pressed Apple and some lacing.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
2938,"2016-02-03",3.9,"Bottle. Head is initially small, fizzy/frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is moderately yeasty (barnyard, horseblanket), with notes of band-aid, apples, autumn leaves / twigs, rosemary. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately to heavily acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, fizzy/lively carbonation, lightly to moderately astringent.

Likely a dupe of some of the other 5.5% brut ciders listed here, but no matter...this is very rustic, farmy stuff...lots of Brett character (nearly too much, the band-aid is a little stronger than ideal), much like a good vintage of Etienne Dupont. Quite acidic too, with just enough residual sugar to make it lip-smacking. Good amount of tannic grip too. This is exactly how I like cider. An easy high 3 / low 4 winner.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2938,"2016-02-02",3.7,"On tap @ Cadet. Chill haze to a golden colored cider with a tall white head. Pretty nice funky, horsey, earthy aroma. Lots of bright apple as well. Some lemon juice, sweet apple pie filling, and a touch of vanilla. Nice earthy and grassy flavor along with some acidity and apple. Light peach. Somewhat sweet up front but a good dryness to the finish.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2938,"2015-11-13",3.8,"Bottle sample. Bright clear golden color, white edge head. Bright fruity apple and pear aroma with a barnyard edge. Taste is tart apple flesh, quick dry finish. Very nice.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
2938,"2015-09-19",3.6,"Bottle thanks to Emily - green apples and musk. Very different from the American ciders Ive had. Dry and a tad sweet. Cant identify the aftertaste.","Taylor Mill, Kentucky, USA","Chudwick"
2938,"2015-07-29",3.7,"Aroma is green apples, champagne and mild sweetness. The flavor is green apples, a hint of band-aid, mild sweetness and a very tart/increasingly dry finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
2938,"2015-07-02",3.9,"Bottle. Typical cider pour, nothing special. Aroma is mild apple with hint of earthy funk. Taste is semi-sweet, neither dry nor sweet, balanced. Has a nice level of earthy funk in the taste as well. Very easy to drink, different than most, and very enjoyable. Added plus is that a large bottle is only $9 or less.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"
