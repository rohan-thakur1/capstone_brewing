796,"2017-01-05",3.5,"Brown sugar nose, subtle clove hints. Cola black, huge tan head. Char and prune. Medium body, harsh. Fruity esters and spicy phenols, rather like a sessionable Belgian quad or dubbel. Much better warm and thoroughly agitated.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
796,"2016-12-14",3.7,"Sent to me by Strykzone.Thanks Dave. The pours a dark brown being almost black with a small beige head the faded quickly and left no lacing of any kind. The nose is chocolate and some citrus. Body is between medium and full and the mouth feel is very smooth. The flavor shows some dark ripe fruit and there is banana in the finish. Easy drinking, tasty, and just an all around good beer.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
796,"2016-11-26",3.6,"Pours deep amber-brown with a quick off white head. Nose is roasty and a little smokey with some caramel and spice poking through. Flavor profile leans sweeter with some bread and brown sugar in a modest malt dose. Finish is quick and clean with a little roast and caramel. Good example of the style.","Georgia, USA","kingaugusta"

796,"2016-10-13",3.5,"12 ounce bottle. Quite dark and opaque. Smaller than one finger head. A gentle cocoa aroma. Earth and syrupy chocolate flavors lead although the chocolate isnÂ’t that big. A smidge of citrus fruit under that. Earth dominates things here. Very light bitterness and some over ripe bananas.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
796,"2016-09-13",3.6,"12 oz. bottled Aug 01, 2016. Deep brown-black body sports a spongy, lasting disc of foam. Nose is mocha, caramel, spicy dry grass and a bit of ash. Tastes of coffee, toasted walnut, caramel apple and hints of gunmetal and ash on the finish.
