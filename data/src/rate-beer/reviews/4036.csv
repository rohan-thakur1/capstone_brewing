Taste is tart, crisp, citrus bitter. Mouthfeel is bright and clean. Finish gets dry and tangy, with a grapefruit bitter close. Super drinkable.","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"
4036,"2017-01-02",4.0,"16oz can c/o Smith. Hazy thick unfiltered orange body. Soapy, foamy white head. Pretty solid Nelson tones, though not overloaded, still remains pretty balanced. The malt backdrop gains a little depth from the white wheat. Soft and delicate Nelson, but a pretty significant Columbus and Centennial flavor as well. Good.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

4036,"2016-12-23",4.1,"Fresh can from the brewery. Strong, pungent aroma of earth, tropical fruits, and mango, with a moderate bitterness at the end to tie it all together. Trilliums signature Fort Point sweet, wheaty malt really shines through. Fantastic.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
4036,"2016-12-19",4.1,"16 oz can to half-pint glass, shared with the Mrs (canned on 12/1/2016). Looks good; a cloudy/juicy pineapplish apricot with foamy eggshell head. Smells and tastes good too; lead of tropical fruit alongside a well-balanced mildly bittersweet backbone. Pineapple, guava, and some citrus zest. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and pleasantly bitter, with some piney hops on the finish. Delicious.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
4036,"2016-12-13",4.2,"Sample at the ""Northeastern vs Northwestern Brewery Tasting"" on 10/29/2016. Hazy orange color with a medium thick foamy bone white head that diminishes gradually to a film. Strings of lacing on the glass. Tropical fruit, floral hops and malt in the nose. Medium body with flavors of mango, citrusy hops, pine and malt. The finish is moderately bitter with a tropical fruit and hops aftertaste. Good beer all around.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

4036,"2016-11-18",4.3,"One of the most crushable pales or IPAs, even by Trillium standards. Bright orange pour. Jammy fruity lightly dank hoppy nose and flavor. Peach and passionfruit and citrus. Drinks like an IPA, big all around except on bitterness. Delicious.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
4036,"2016-11-16",3.3,"4 pack of cans drunk over the course of 3 weeks.Large white head shows somewhat less retention than many other fort points. Very hazy, copper-golden body.The Nelso is certainly there, front and center, in the nose, but its a bit dulled and harried by the very strong esters and light booze. Cherry, lime, strawberry, earth and various minerals are all present but it almost seems dirty due to this huge yeastiness. Extremely dried out, sparse cracker malts do nothing to help out.So it goes in the mouth, with fun, fruity, earthy and mineral laden juice notes from the hops but a very, very aggressive bitterness, alcohol and ester profile. Very dry, grainy texture. I hope we are just in a transition period from 60 bbl to 75 or 90 bbl batches because the beers are once again off. Seems like they need longer conditioning, as well.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4036,"2016-11-16",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 16, 2016 Poured from a 16 oz can dated 10/20/2016. Aroma is super hoppy with lots of melon, mango, papaya, passion fruit, citrus and hints of stone fruit. Light dank and resin notes. Light cracker malt notes with hints of wheat. Pours a hazy, dull, orange colored with a medium sized, moderately thick, white head that recedes to a thin film that lingers on the edges. Moderately high lacing and small legs. Flavor is slightly sweet with medium light cracker malt and faint wheat notes. Medium high to high bitterness. Moderately strong hop flavors with mango, papaya, guava, passion fruit and melon. Lighter citrus and dank notes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall, I love the Nelson hops. So much great tropical fruit and melon notes. Some balanced dank notes with a nice malt backbone. I could drink this all day.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
4036,"2016-11-14",4.0,"Pint can. Wonderfully hoppy aroma, full of Nelson flavor. Big sweet grape and honeysuckle with pineapple and a melon-kiwi sweetness. Mild mint, some tangerine and pine. Juicy and floral. Mild biscuity malt underneath. Moderate bitterness, mostly in the finish. Fairly dry. Doesnt quite deliver on all of the hoppiness of the aroma - just picks up a little too much pine resin in the finish - but its still very tasty. Refreshing and easy to drink. Yellowish orange-tan color, glowy. Big white head, lots of lacing. Quite good.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
4036,"2016-11-09",3.9,"Tasted on 11/8/16 from a 16oz can, big thanks to Alex for this one. Pours cloudy orange with a very thick, rocky white head that slowly recedes to thick, sticky lace. The nose is primarily citrus, but rather than the orange and grapefruit I am used to from Trillium, this one is lemon and lime with a nice pitted fruit quality, white grapes, and a touch of malt that is also reminiscent of orange juice. The flavor is bursting with even more white grape and pitted fruit, with the lemon and lime zest showing some bitterness on the back of the palate, and some more bread-like malt than on the nose. The body is medium with average carbonation, and a long nicely bitter lime peel and hint of bread malt finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
