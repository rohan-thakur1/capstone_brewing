2293,"2016-01-18",3.0,"330ml bottle from De Bierboom in Brugge: poured into a Hoegaarden Grand Cru stemmed tulip glass at home on 18th Jan 2016. The last beer of a mini tasting with myself. I allowed the sediment to leave the bottle: Deep ruby red body, beige head, thin. The head soon left leaving a weak collar which in turn swiftly disappeared. Red fruits (berries) and Rye in the aroma and maybe some wood like notes with a Bourbon trace or two. Taste follows along the same lines with the Bourbon becoming more noticeable, some vanilla and mixed spice in the flavour also. Not too sure the Rye and barrel aging works, with each having their own identity and flavour which do not marry very well in my opinion. Interesting and different the beer is: high scoring and worthy of praise? I have scored it objectively and actually quite like it even if I doubted it¬ís balance and blending.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

2293,"2015-06-25",4.4,"Fles vintage 2012 gekocht bij EtreGourmet, uitgeschonken in origineel Struise bierglas. Donker amberkleurig troebel bier, met een beige schuimkraag die zich redelijk snel terugtrekt. Het schuim blijft wel voortdurend aanwezig op het bier, deze XXX triple van Struise, heeft zeker niet de verschijning van een typische tripel, die vaak blond van kleur zijn. De aroma's zijn aangenaam elegant, fruitig en krachtig, roggebrood, karamel, gedroogd fruit, vanille en houtig met een vleugje bourbon. De smaak volgt de geur; zoetige karamel, pruimen, dadels, vijgen, honing, kruiden als vanille en kruidnagel, houtige tannines en een mooie finish van verwarmende bourbon tonen. De afdronk is lang, kruidig, behoorlijk bitter en alcohol verwarmend. Zoals ik al had verwacht wederom een bier met veel finesse en perfectie van De Struise Brouwers. De barrel aging is fantastisch. Doet niks onder voor de Quadrupel van Struise, heerlijk bier, wel een vrij atypische tripel.

Overall sweet, with a light bitter earthy finish, where also the sweet caramel and fruits gets trough the most. Some wood, the alcohol is there also, but the mouthfeel lacks a bit of thickness. Decent brew, but I hoped just to get that little bit more from this one. Struise got better for sure.","BERMUDA","Abio"
2293,"2013-11-12",4.0,"Bottle from Au Grain d¬íOrge, Crissier; bb 26.05.2018Hazy amber color, small head. The aroma is fruity, fresh, vinous, with some barrel, wood (7.5). Malt flavor, moderately sweet, with a nice elegant vinous touch, light acidity, light fruitiness, pleasant alcohol warmth; correct bitterness.It doesn¬ít have a sharp trait, it¬ís just a very well brewed, balanced, modern Belgian beer.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
2293,"2013-11-10",3.7,"750ml bottle @ Maunula beer tasting 091113. Ordered from Bierzwerg.

Aroma of yeast and dry fruit. Red/Brown colour with small foam. Taste follows dry fruit and overdone apple. Interesting beer, not bad!","Helsinki, FINLAND","c0fein"
2293,"2013-11-03",3.7,"33cl bottle. Hazy brown with tanned small head. 
NOSE : tart, yeast, vanilla, banana, cooked fruits, dried apricot and mango, wood, smoke.
SIP : thick body with oily texture. Low carbonation. The beer has a round and well balanced taste till the finish. It reveals sweet malt flavors that carry on till the and. On the way I get some sour and lactic notes. Barrel aging in bourbon is obvious since the wood and bourbon taste is there. Ranging from vanilla to nuts. It¬ís quite mild and making it easy to drink. None of the flavors bursts and go out of balance. 
OVERALL : I would expect more distinctive aromas and flavors from it. The bourbon oak barrels are well present and well incorporated. Balance is great and the body is thick. Interesting brew. One would prefer it to be more exciting.","Warszawa, POLAND","Swaroga"

2293,"2013-09-22",3.9,"Tap at the schoolhouse as BBA Rye Tripel. Very oaky and fruity nose, canilla, oranges, apricots. Big influence from the bourbon is well integrated into the tripel. Super smooth and silky. Great.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
2293,"2013-09-14",2.2,"Bottle from etregourmet.be biershop, shared with the Die By the Beer crew during Bergen √òlfestival 2013. Pours a dark semi-muddy brown body with a tiny white head. Aroma is oak, caramel, bourbon, hints of rye and Norwegian brown cheese. Taste is caramel, wood, Norwegian brown cheese, sugary raisins and hints of rye, nuts and cereals. Flat, oily body. The rather dark-hued taste profile completely masks the ""tripel"" quality of the beer, and the flavors are somewhat messy rather than integrated, despite the complexity. Quite inferior quality from Struise this time around, I¬ím sad to say.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"
2293,"2013-08-04",4.0,"Draft @ Het Schooltje, merci Carlo.
Ambr√©e, col fin beige.
Ar√¥me malt√©, grill√© avec ce bouquet cons√©quent de seigle, ce dernier ajoutant des effluves grains-√©pices. Le bourbon est juste en balance, fruit√© avec un fruit√© rappelant la p√™che/abricot.
Palais reste assez √©pais comme souvent avec le seigle, pointe d¬í√©pice avec un bourbon subtile qui donne ce c√¥t√© bois√© sur pointe de vanille. Caramel en retrait avec en fin de bouche les 10% qui commencent √† prendre de la place. Les houblons parviennent, et cela malgr√© l¬íaccent sur les grains et bourbon, √† donner une dimension agr√©able √† la bi√®re et une amertume mod√©r√© accompagne chaque gorg√©e.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
2293,"2013-07-26",3.8,"Bottle @ Cervezorama. Brown colour with a tan head with a good duration. Aroma is strong barrel, bourbon and with hints of caramel. Flavor is quite similas as aroma, dominated by bourbon notes, caramel, and slightly acidic, rye notes as well that confers a good rounded sensation inside mouth. The final has notes of bourbon and mild alcoholic with a dry sensation. Creamy and rounded on palate.","Madrid, SPAIN","teddybeer"

2293,"2013-06-28",3.8,"Had this at the De Struise Tap Takeover at Churchkey. Poured a slightly dark amber color with a small white head. Aroma had notes of the barrel, light spice, yeast character as there, but pretty well rounded. Rye was not at all present, at least not compared to the barrel notes. Had it side by side with the non-Bourbon Barrel Aged version, and this certainly was more smooth and mellow than the other one was.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"

Cloudy amber brown color, bright white edge head. Aroma of light bourbon, caramel candy, slight vanilla. Taste is rich whiskey, vanilla, dark fruit. Tasty, but the bourbon covers the spiciness of the rye a bit.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
