3922,"2017-04-08",3.9,"Ugly ass purple/pink murky pour, larger white head with pink hues. Raspberry, boysenberry, tart citrus in the aroma and taste, lighter yeast note. Lighter body. Insanely drinkable.","","Johnsense"
3922,"2016-11-17",4.2,"Bottle. Ruby pink with tan head. Boysenberries, tart berries, wine and oak aromas. Flavors are dark tart berries, wine and funky flavors.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
3922,"2016-07-12",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2016 Poured from a 750 ml bottle. Aroma is fairly berry forward with some light yogurt and lemon notes. Some light wheat character. Mostly an unripe blackberry character, but also some boysenberry skins. Some medium light leafy notes. There is a very green character. Pours a hazy, reddish purple with a large, moderately thick and pillowy, pinkish head that recedes to a thin film that lingers for a long time. No lacing or legs. Flavor is fairly acidic with a light sweetness. Light to moderate, phenolic, leafy character with moderate tannins from the berry skins. Quite a bit of boysenberry flavor with a bit lighter blackberry note. Light lemon and yogurt notes with a hint of wheat. Lingering berry and acid notes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall, a very berry forward berliner, but I think it?s too acidic and the berry notes could be better. I think I prefer the regular Bu series to the imperial one. It?s kind of weird because the aroma has a really green berry note, but the flavor is very strongly boysenberry.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3922,"2015-07-18",4.2,"750 ml bottle to base-fluted de Garde geuze glass (shared with the Mrs.). Looks good; a very cloudy flesh plum with fizzy light cranberry head that steadily dissipates into thin lacing. Smells great! Loads of blackberry and boysenberry with a sharply pleasant lactic presence complemented nicely by an appropriate level of oak. Tastes like it smells, only much fruitier. Still fantastic, but the fruit dominates the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and lively. Excellent.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
3922,"2015-07-15",2.0,"[ 75cl Bottle ][ 5oz ][ @tasting ][ $ - ? ][ Tulip ][ 07.14.15 ]Calling this a berliner weisse seems foul. Its a Sour/Wild or Fruit beer given the aggressive citric acid and lack of comparable grain. murky red chestnut, thin cream pink head, large bubbled. Musty Berry nose, moderate green fruit, chlorine, and rubber off notes. Cleaner Berry front palate, tons of fruit sweetness in the absence of acid, more citric mid-finish tingling jaw, finish is sweet. Without the acid this just comes off simple, a basic fruit beer with plenty of nose errors.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
3922,"2015-07-14",2.5,"Pour is cloudy purplish ruby with a light pink head. Nose is very frozen ice pop of juice berry, off green note, sugary, a bit artificial and very simple. Flavor is also very simple, lots of that same sugary berry juice with a moderately acidic finish, not nearly as acidic as purple raz thankfully. Very sweet, fuller body, higher carb.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
3922,"2015-06-19",3.9,"Murky red raspberry pour with high fizzy head. Nose is to me as all de gardes are, fantastic and better than the taste. De Garde funk, yeast and soo much fruit. Berries galore. Raspberries and blackberries and cherry and a hint of watermelon. Lemony and some acidity. Nice medium body. A little tart for my taste. Not as balanced as others from Trevor. Taste is a bit weaker than the nose. Lemons and bright acidity lead to a nice fruity palate. Fresh and underripe berries, a touch of the bitter seeds and skin. The fruit flavor goes too quickly to a acetic end. Good but not amazing.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
