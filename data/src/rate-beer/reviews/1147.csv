1147,"2017-06-17",4.3,"Bottle at Drie Fonteinen Lambic-o-Droom, shared with the wife..cheers! Pours a deep golden color, light copper hues and amber touch. Aromas of deep oak, baryard, musty basement, horse blanket, light citrus peel and an underlying sweetness. Whoa! Taste is similar with a medium body and sticky texture pushing notes of horse blanket, lemon peel, light hay and oak. More depth in waves of light honey sweetness, floral notes, light earth and more oak. Finishes lightly sweet with underripe fruit notes and a final dose of funk. Fantastic!","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"
1147,"2017-06-04",4.4,"Very dark golden color. Hints of orange. Big frothy white head. The. ARoma is as usually, amazing. Lemon, peach, mold and wood. Smells a tad bit sweeter. The flavor is way different than a standard gueuze. The Iquitos is not as carbonated. A bit thin but the flavor is great. More sweet, a little pear and fresh apple. Lots of lemony juice and raspberry. Very tart with a lot of fruit. Delicious beer!","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

Aroma of green apples, typical 3 Fonteinen funk, dusty cellar, grapes, oak and cobwebs. Flavour is above light sweet and moderate sour, starting soft before going into a long acidic finish.
