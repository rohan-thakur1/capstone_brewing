3106,"2016-11-18",3.8,"Wow, very unique Saison. Orange color with tiny floating island of white fluff. Smoke and tobacco nose. Taste is spicy yeast up front, lemon tart, funk sour cheese, and smoked back end. Nice medium mouthfeel. no overwhelming flavor characteristics here, nice balance of opposites here.

3106,"2016-04-21",4.1,"Bottle via trade; shared at the RLGK tasting, March 2016. Pours a hazy golden body with thin white lacing. Nose is bright, refined smoke character. Mouthfeel is that of a tart saison with beautiful smoked meat flavors swirling with the tart oak profile. Really unlike any smoked beer Ive ever tried, and pretty stellar.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
3106,"2016-04-03",3.9,"Sample at a NYC-tasting at jredmonds place. Hazy golden beer with a decent offwhite head. Fruity smoked aroma, peach, grapes, citrus, peat notes, some wood and yeast. Fruity woody flavor, balanced smoke, grapes, citrus, floral notes, some yeast. Very good.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rlgk"
3106,"2015-12-14",2.7,"Bottle. Cloudy gold pour, with an off white head. Burnt tires, rubbery smoke, mildly salty, lemon, and moderate sourness. Im not liking this, not enjoyable, difficult to drink.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
3106,"2015-11-04",4.1,"A- pours a hazy apricot gold. Thin bright white head.

S- citrus notes: Lemon, white peaches and grapefruit. Smoke is prominent but light at the same time. So balanced. Characteristics of Chardonnay. Butter, white grapes and lime. Some latex and medicinal qualities. 

M- light to medium tacky body with a good acidic and sweet palate. 

T- very vibrant up front. Key lime and lemon start. Light sweet doughs and butter in the middle. Smoke and wood flow through the middle but it is so contained and comes off as a genuine affectation. Ending is creamy and sweet with a mild bitterness. White grapes and tannins with some sour cream and yogurt. Best smoked beer I have ever had.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
3106,"2015-06-17",4.0,"2/20/15. Bottle shared by someone at RBWG 2015. Golden pour with a nice khaki head and good lacing. Great aroma - light smoke, tartness, Smarties, stone fruit, mild acidity. Good flavor, but disappointed comparatively. Smoke and sour not jiving as well together, smoked lemons, vanilla, oak, light tartness. Not bad.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
3106,"2015-06-08",4.0,"Poured from a bottle. 
Aroma is moderately smokey with some light oak and wine tannins. Medium light stone fruit character with light acidity and citrus. Light, sweet malt notes. 
Pours a slightly hazy, bright yellow gold with a small, fairly thin white head that recedes somewhat quickly to the edges where it lingers. Meidum lacing and medium small legs. 
Flavor is moderately acidic with some lemon and lime notes. Light sweetness. Some light stone fruit notes of peaches and apricots. Medium low bitterness and low oak notes. Medium to medium light smokiness. A bit of lingering oak, acidity and smoke. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice beer. The base saison is very nice and the smoke acts as a replacement for the traditional phenolics. Nice fruit and acidity, but some people might get put off by the smoke.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3106,"2015-06-02",4.0,"750 mL bottle into Teku. Pale golden with lively carb and big head. Aroma is oak, smoke, citrus, funk, and pepper. Taste really grew on me as I drank it. Tasted to me like cask 200 with some smoked malt. Meaty, tart, oaky, and smokey taste. Liked it a lot wouldve lvoed it without the smoke.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
3106,"2015-06-01",3.8,"750ml bottle in a tulip. Pours hazy amber with an off-white head. Aroma of light tartness / sourness, some smoky malts, light barrels and hints of light fruits, and some light malts. Flavor the same with a decent blend but weird smoky finish. Average texture. A cool beer but would be better if not smoked.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"

3106,"2015-03-07",4.1,"Bottle shared with a couple friends compliments of Joe, thanks brah. Pours hazy golden with small to medium white head. Smoked sea salt, light pest, pink grapefruit, almonds, lemon and funk. Smoky and tart in all the right ways. Maybe the best smoked sour to date.

3106,"2015-02-28",4.1,"Bottle. It pours a pale gold color with a shrinking off white head. The aroma is very smoky with salted meat, a little wood and background notes of grilled peaches and apricot. Pleasant subdued smoky phenols. The flavor is tart and smoky and yes, it works beautifully. Salty with mild phenols and strong lactic lemony, peach tart. The smoke and salt are pretty strong but the lactic sourness stands up nicely. In fact, this was much more sour than I expected it to be. No acetic acid and no alcohol. Light bodied with strong carbonation. Wow. I really loved this one, and I was prepared to be disappointed for some reason. Silly me.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

3106,"2015-02-20",3.7,"Bottle shared late night during RBWG 2015. Pours cloudy yellow-gold with a white foam head. The aroma has some smoke up front, then tangy lemon character. Light sweet flavor with dry smoke, soft bacon, more lemon, sweat. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Lingering smoke in the finish, tart lemon, salty bacon and sweat, pale bread. Good stuff.

3106,"2015-02-20",4.2,"Bottle thanks to Will. Pours a cloudy yellow gold with small white head that diminishes to nothing. The aroma is strong smoke, funk, oak, lacto. Thin mouthfeel with nice tartness, lingering smoke, mineral, cheese, light dryness, really enjoyed this one.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3106,"2015-02-13",3.8,"Bottle from SARA. Pours a hazy gold. Intense nose -- smoked meat, campfire, lacto, lemon, funk. Taste has all of that but some nice fruity brett (I think?) ties it together and cleans it up. Very enjoyable and definitely intense. This would be a great bottle to share with a few friends; 6 oz. or so would be a perfect serving for me.","Valley Village, California, USA","Ontape"
3106,"2015-02-10",4.1,"Clear golden orange in color... Aroma of smoke, ash, lemon, citrus, funk... Flavor is lemon tartness, tons of saltiness to mesh with the smoke, funk and smoke on the palate... Perfect marriage of salt, lemon and smoke... Delicious","California, USA","baraciisch"
3106,"2014-10-23",3.5,"Draft at the source  reviewed from notes (9/7/2014). Aroma is funky, goaty, and smoky, of course. There is some earthiness to the aroma that brings out the barrel. Good depth. The beer pours slightly hazy golden with small white head and decent lacing. Taste is tart, mineral-like, light lemon, with smoke and earth on the finish. I agree with all the other reviews that the barrel cuts out most of the smoke that is in the aroma. The body is a bit fuller than the base, still light on the tongue with a dry finish. The barrel adds more depth to the body which I enjoyed.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
3106,"2014-09-13",4.0,"On tap at the brewery. Pours clear gold with a wispy white head. Aroma is sharp and funky, old yogurt, slight phenol, goat cheese. Flavor follows, strong acidity like plain greek yogurt, lemon curd, subtle smoke, oak. I thought it was delicious.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
3106,"2014-09-06",3.7,"Tap @SARA. Pours hazy golden orange with a small off-white head and good lacing on the glass. Aroma is smokey, lemon, funk, basement, a bit of oak. Flavor is dry, lightly tart with a touch of funk and smoke, but less of both than the nose suggests. There is some smoke lingering on the finish. Not a lot of barrel notes in the flavor. Medium body.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3106,"2014-09-06",3.4,"On tap at Sante. Clear orange, little foam. Lightly fruity and funky with some smoke in the nose. More funk, tart apparent in the mouth and the smokiness of course, which dominates the after taste. The smoke isnt strong but i dont think it marries well with the base beer.","California, USA","barn0216"
