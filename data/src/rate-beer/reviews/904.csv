904,"2017-06-07",4.2,"Rated on 6-07-2017. (Bottle) The appearance is a medium sized ivory head that is mostly lasting, hazy golden body, lively, fast rising carbonation observed, and one ring of lacing. The aroma is citrus hops, light pine hops, tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange, sweet, floral hops, caramel, and malt. The flavor presents moderate bitterness, citrus hops, tropical fruit, grapefruit, lemon, spicy, some ABV, caramel, malt, and a semi-dry finish. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation and this beer is medium bodied. This is an excellent beer and tastes more like an IPA than a CC styled beer. It is a very refreshing beer with a light bitter finish. It is an enjoyable beer to not only drink, but to rate. It is a beer that I would definitely purchase again and again. Thanks Smuttynose for a very good brewed beer!! Cheers!","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"

904,"2017-05-05",2.9,"seems im a little out of the loop here, I have had this a couple of times and finished the whole bottles. I find this hoppy with grapefruit and lemon citrus and somewhat dry. the beer is a bit chalky and seems a little too weak. light foam in the body take charge which rarely is a brag point. the abv seems lower to an appreciable degree.","New Jersey, USA","BREWMUSKCLES"

Taste is sweet, grapefruit, honey, some alcohol, light lemon, black pepper. Medium body, some resin, light stickiness. Its ok, but maybe theres a reason cali commons arent usually so high in ABV...","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
904,"2017-02-21",3.9,"Bottle at home. This is more interesting than I was expecting. The lager yeast gives it that noticeable bite in the middle, but theres some surprisingly potent, citrusy hops in there, which gives it the lemon-lime aroma and flavor of an IPA. Well done.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

Toasted caramel and nutty sweetness with grassy woody nutty citrus bitterness in dry nutty finish. Medium light body fairly soft texture.

904,"2016-02-05",3.2,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2016 Bomber BEST BY 07/14/16. Nose beautifully hoppy, superb fresh tropical hops with pleasant rind, just captivating. Pours dark clear golden thats leaned over into orange, supports a soapy beige head. Oily medium body sharply crisp and strongly bitter, there are some stinging alcohols and hints of onion and metal, enough to temporarily damage the taste buds when combined with the carbonation. Palate cleansed/scrubbed right off, some mild malt with orange peel and a touch of marmalade, bitterness thins and stays away from dank and woody notes. Moderately dry, peppery. I like this, and I like its attitude, but the aggression limits repeatability. (And while the marketing alludes to status as a Cali Common-type beer, this is just another IPA.)

904,"2016-02-02",3.7,"Rating #6700! Tallahassee, Fl - Market Square Liquors - 22 oz bomber. Slight haze to the light copper pour, omnipresent soft beady snow-white head, light lacing. Aroma has some fresh lake water accents, a hint of olive oil, some light date actions. Flavor has a light citrus bent to it, some light toffee sweetness, a bit of nuttiness in the back end. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Pretty nice.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
904,"2016-01-30",3.8,"From the 650 ml. bottle with a Best By 07/14/16 date. Golden yellow pour under a lingering off-white head. The aroma has a kind of citrus and melon hop character along with a toasted biscuit character. The body is medium. The taste is not as hopped up as I imagined but it is balanced. Good sweet malt character along with a mild to moderate dry finish.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
904,"2015-09-22",3.3,"Bomber picked up at Cigarette City. Pours golden brown with a big off white head. Aroma is pine, caramel, wet cardboard. Flavor is caramel, bread, pine. Theres pine and orange in the finish. Not bad considering this is a 6 month old brew.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
904,"2015-03-15",3.5,"Dark orange, 1 finger head. The aroma is great. citrus, some piney notes but a little sweetness. Really good citra and pineapple. More of those beers with a sweet finish but the tropical fruits here are nice. not much else.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
904,"2015-03-11",4.1,"22oz bomber poured into a nonic glass led to a slightly hazy copper colored brew. Massive off-white frothy head stayed around quite awhile which allow lacing along most of the glass. Fruity, citrus aroma dominated by the grapefruit. Very carbonated to start but calmed after awhile. Tastes of grapefruit, tangerine, and breaded malts. Soft and smooth with some bitterness on the palate. Pretty impressed with this collaboration and I found this to be very enjoyable.","New Hampshire, USA","dpgjrnhcraftbrew"
904,"2015-03-09",4.0,"Bottle from the Lazy Dog and at a decent 4.99 as well. 
Lightly hazy pale golden color with a huge frothy white head that persists forever. Spicy earthy floral hop aroma with a bit of bready caramel to back it up. Solid bready caramel base with an almost minty earthy hop flavor. Medium body with moderate to high carbonation. Nice brew, if only I didnt have to play chase the beer truck to find a store in my area that hadnt already sold out of its one case allotment.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
904,"2015-03-06",3.6,"22 oz. bottle purchased at a great price at Cigarette City, Seabrook. Could u gold with lasting head retention. The aroma is more like a hopped APA, deep floral notes with a mild pine on top of some sweet beard.
 
Mildly sweet malt upfront with a nicely light lingering floral and pine hops that was found in the aroma. The body is lighter but has a nice crispness and a secondary citrus rind dryness. I paid $4.99 for this bottle, what a hell of a bargain! For the flavor and price I had to bump it up let a tad. Very nicely worked.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
