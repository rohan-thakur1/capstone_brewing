3155,"2017-05-20",4.0,"750ml bottle, thanks Jonathan G. Aroma: vineous nose, cheese, oak, lots of blackberries, cherries, lots of funk similar to a lambic. App: dark red with orange tint, minimal off light pink head leaving good lacing considering the size of this head. Taste and palate: medium body, moderate high carbonation, light sweetness, tart, moderate acidity, salty and really dry finish. Overall: quite interesting beer. Lots of funk, lots of fruits, dryness and tartness. Wonder if I should have aged it since there are some similarities with some Cantillon. Good stuff.","St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Stoned99"

3155,"2017-03-29",4.3,"Bottle thanks to @@ron! Shite,I didnt realize this was such an esteemed beer when I opened it! My wife thought it was so so, for what its worth. I enjoyed the very hazy reddish pour, light off-white head and decent lacing. The aroma is a great mix of blackberries and lactic slightly cheesy funk. Flavor is light plus tart, blackberries, medium funk with a horseblanket note that reminds one of lambic in addition to a certain cheesiness. Some tannins from the barrels as well. Medium body, soft mouthfeel. Enjoyable.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

3155,"2017-02-07",3.5,"750 mL bottle. Pink body. Medium white head. Smells of berries and strong acidity. A hint of rubber. Tastes of strong blackberry. Pretty sour. A little yogurt. Oak. Less rubber, but its still there. Well carbonated. Its not bad.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3155,"2017-02-06",4.5,"From notes. Bottle shared with ebone1988, Gus, and Aaron at Gus Birthday V2. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a bright pink/purple color with a tiny ring of light pink head that vanishes in an instant. The aroma is hugely sour. Holy shit. My mouth waters and clenches at the aroma. The blackberry is fantastic. There is a beautiful funk. The light barnyard balances out a little dustiness and this just is wonderful. Sour, tart, and fruity. The flavor is just as good. The fruit is heavy, and the tartness is just fantastic. The mouth-watering ability of this beer are delightful. Light funk and fruit really go with the resounding sour. The mouth feel is light, crisp, clean with a bright carbonation and a heavy sour blackberry on the finish. Fuck, is this a fantastic beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3155,"2016-09-05",4.2,"750, corked and baled. Thanks, C! I seriously have trouble explaining how much I appreciate this. Such an incredible treat I didnt think Id get my hands on anytime soon. Pours a crystal clear medium pinkish purple, more on the purple side. Bright piercing acidic berry nose, intense juicy sour berries and sharp lemon zest, balanced with berry sweetness and some light malt sweetness; overall very cohesive and incredibly inviting. Creamy medium body with minimal carb but a pleasant acidic bite to it. Sharp berry sourness, lemon zest, lightly sweetened cereal under that. Long tangy sweet sharp finish.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Taste is nice balance between the sour base and tart, tannic blackberries, and a sensation of sweetness from the fruit. Seedy, brambly blackberries.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"

Aroma and flavor are sour blackberry, firm blueberry skin, lemon, boysenberry and oak. Lighter to medium body. Shes pretty sour but has just the right amount of acid before becoming unbearable like Jester King, bruery, and certain de garde offerings. Solid yo","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"

3155,"2015-08-25",4.0,"Bottle @ Aarons Wedding Eve Shindig. Thanks, @@. Hazed reddish-purple pour with some khaki head. Really nice blackberry aroma. Pie filling, some grass, and a nice bit of lemon zest. A light vinous quality to the flavor along with some tangy berry and a touch of jammy sweetness. Good acidity, some citrus zest, and a nice dry/tannic note to the finish. Nice beer.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3155,"2015-08-20",4.2,"Bottle shared at my pre-wedding bash with some other RB nerds. Pours a hazy, purplish appearance with a light brown head. The aroma is similar to Oak Theory with some lemon, lactic acid, funk, cheese, and oak. Along with that, theres plenty of berries that arent overly powerful. The flavor again has Oak Theory forefront with complementary berries. Slight tannins / slightly seedy. Not burningly sour. Plenty of oak. Really enjoyable. Again, the fruit doesnt completely dominate the flavor which is a breath of fresh air. One of the better fruit beers Ive had in a while. I preferred this one to the Balaton Cherry Cut slightly but both were fantastic. Very good.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"

3155,"2015-08-08",4.0,"Bottle at the Niels pre wedding bash. Pinkish pour, pretty hazy with a small white head. Similar to the cherry in that you can taste the fruit skins but it isnt astringent like chewing on s grape skin. Moderately fruit forward in comparison to other sours but these Casey folks are striking a great balance in fruit and funkiness. Moderate barny and almost cheese like. Still has a moderate lemon and wood character similar to oak theory. Dang good.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
3155,"2015-08-07",4.0,"Bottle at Aarons Pre-Wedding Bash. Pour is hazy pink with a small white head and decent lacing. Funky, cheesy, biscuit, bready, some urine, fruit skins, and blackberries in the aroma. Taste is big sour fruits, blackberry skins, raspberries, tangy, lots of oak, lemon and biscuit with a huge sour finish. Light body with medium carbonation. Tasty, but not what I expected.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
