3117,"2011-06-24",4.1,"Draft at Good Dog.

Pours pitch black and completely opaque with faint mahogany edges and a half finger light beige head that immediately settles into a thin ring.  Minimal lacing.  

Intense aroma with a nice balance of sweet bourbon, subtle dry, earthy oak and vanilla with a good amount of smoke.  Even with all of that, the sweet malts are still evident with hints of licorice, chocolate and toffee.  Impressive.

Full chewy body with a nice balance of sweet boozy heat, barrel character, sweet malt and toasty smoke.  Lots of bourbon sweetness up front with hints of vanilla and faint earthy oak.  This is followed by sone more alcohol flavor with faint yeast.  Sweet malt notes follow with hints of bitter dark chocolate, coffee and toffee .  Dry rosted finish where all of the smoke is found.  Subtle rauch character gives great balance with hints of spicy BBQ, bacon, charcoal and burnt malt.  sweet boozy finish that is nice and smokey.  Very complex and decently balanced.  A bit sweet and boozy but not too much so at 9.2%.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
3117,"2011-04-13",3.4,"On tap at Bullfrog last weekend. Reviewed from notes.

Pours a very dark brown that is nearly opaque and has a very slight head without much of any lacing. The nose is initially a bit harsh with a faint scent that borders on nail polish, but might be coming from the alcohol. There is some strong bourbon and burnt espresso. The taste is quite a bit smoother with bourbon, espresso, light oak, and vanilla. Booze in the feel, but overall it is quite smooth. Drinks quite well and the only issue is with a bit of initial harshness in the nose.

Serving type: on-tap

3117,"2010-11-28",4.3,"On tap at Capones. Pours a dark red-tinged brown with a small mocha head. Aroma is all sorts of goodness. Vanilla, oak, chocolate, and even some berries. Flavor is hard to describe. I dont think any other beer has given me this much trouble. At first its almost like an imperial stout. Then, the vanilla, bourbon, and oak flavors really come out.. The finish has a fruitiness to it I was not expecting at all. Very light smokiness. Incredible. Consider me blown away.","Ambler, Pennsylvania, USA","Steeeve"

3117,"2010-11-26",4.2,"5oz pour from a flight at Capones.  Pour is dark, sticky tree sap with an inch of beige head.  Nose is smoke, caramel, dark fruits, and a boat load of malt.  Taste is a fantastic dopple bock set on a smoker for half a day.  This is truly a delicious take on the style.  It starts with a dopple as solid as Celebrator and throws an artists taste of smoke into the mix.  If you are a fan of dopple bocks, dont pass on this brew as it is amazing.",", Pennsylvania, USA","ljay6880"

3117,"2010-11-25",3.3,"At brewpub. Dark brown, thick creamy-tan head. Bourbon-vanilla balance with hints of smoke in the nose, also a sawdusty oxidized-like note that stops there. At first the flavor comes off as partially integrated, some smoke and chocolate but too much bourbon. As I continued to sniff and sip, warmth showed a lot of separation but a totally unique combo. Lager base emerges, light grain notes, then partially covered by the bourbon. Its all bourbon by the bottom of the glass. Went from interesting to unique to overdone in about 30 minutes.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
3117,"2010-11-23",3.8,"Growler, from brewery.  Pours a very dark brown, almost black pour with a frothy one finger light brown head that left minimal lacing.  The nose is more roasty and bourbon forward than it is smoky.  Lots of vanilla, charred wood, light alcohol, rather sweet smelling, burnt caramel, and just a touch of smoke.  The flavor is heavy on the bourbon and vanilla, lightly smoky, lots of sweet caramel and some roast.  Finishes with a kick of alcohol and lingering burnt caramel.  Mouthfeel is rather thick and a bit sticky with moderate fizzy carbonation.  Rather warming on the finish.  Pretty decent, not the easiest drinking beer to take down a growler of between two people, but with a sense of purpose, we were able to prevail.  Doesnt really fit the bill as a Smoked to me, but whatever.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
