2214,"2017-01-14",3.7,"Light copper. Light spicy hop with a good biscuit malt backbone. Medium bodied. Easy but full flavored. Liters of this, please.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
2214,"2016-03-12",3.0,"On tap at Chuckanut, pours a clear copper orange with a large beige head. Aroma brings out authentic German lager yeast, bready malt and some toasted nuts. Flavour is along the same lines, with clean notes of bready malt, corn and German lager yeast. Well-done for what it is, just nothing overly special. Decent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2214,"2010-02-08",3.7,"Golden amber.  Very pretty.  Fully caramelly character with chocolate malt accents.  Nice malt complexity.  Good beer - cant wait to visit the brewpub.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

This is a crazy good stuff. Beautiful amber pour, lovely nose, fruity beautiful flavor with plenty of roasty malt, juicy, crisp, full....and well integrated. Masterful brewing from Chuckanut.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2214,"2009-12-18",3.4,"Draught @ at Brouwers Café. &nbsp Coppery amber, thin to moderate off-white head, mild carbonation, spotty lacing. &nbsp Soft toasted malt nose, slight earthiness or soil. &nbsp Has a bit more hop on the tongue and on the nose than most. &nbsp Toasted malt finish, mild sweetness, fairly clean albeit a little more bitter than most. &nbsp A little bit of lingering cereal, but not too much. &nbsp Good, flavorful, has character unlike so many others, but a little less cereal and earthiness would be good.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
2214,"2009-10-11",3.3,"On tap at the 2009 Enumclaw Okterfest.  A very solid okterfest beer.  A little more bready than others, but still a solid offering.","Bremerton, Washington, USA","Bier brauen"
2214,"2009-10-03",3.2,"A light malt aroma, some honey maybe. this is tasty at first but has a malt that I dont like too much. Okay.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
2214,"2009-09-21",3.2,"tap at fremont oktoberfest.  clear golden light color. Straw hops nose. Plain tasting, not much marzen taste or flavor but clean and refreshing taste.","Seattle, Washington, USA","carruthm"
2214,"2009-08-15",3.8,"On tap at the BP. Clear light brown amber with a small but persistant light tan head. Light malty woody arooma, with just a touch of a twang of hops.  Flavor is malty and soft. LIghtly carmelized,  Lively carbonation and a nice balanced slightly woody flavor. 
I really liked this beer, especially for a style I dont get too excited about.
Well done.","Boise, Idaho, USA","IndianaRed"
2214,"2008-12-18",3.7,"Toasty and nutty with some hop aspects too. Clear amber pour with a huge head. Nice and malty. Toast, caramel, some american hop bitterness in the finish. Super clean finish. VEry well done.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2214,"2008-11-17",3.9,"Draft at the WABL 3rd anniversary party. Crystal clear dark amber with a dense but rather shallow (and brief) tan head. Brown bread and red apple nose. Lightish body, very clean but not watery. Crisp, clean brown bread mid-palate. Mild finish. Great stuff. Beautifully executed.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2214,"2008-10-27",3.4,"Characteristic melanoidin-brassy red. Thin layer of head coats the beer. Feint aroma intimates hops. Melanoidin malt makes a strong impression on the olfactory and gustatory senses.  Nice round malt flavor with twinge of malt ball.  Slight hopping.  Well-balanced, easy drinking. Solid for the style.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
