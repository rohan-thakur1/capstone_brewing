4032,"2017-04-02",4.6,"Bottled on 3/16/17. Served from 22 oz. bottle into glass. Pours pale gold in color, with yellow orange tint, super hazy with creamy white head. Huge fresh hop aroma right away: lots of citrus and tropical fruit, orange, mango, grapefruit. Smells like a mimosa made with freshly squeezed orange juice. No herbaceous or piney aroma but a subtle freshly mowed grass in the background. No malt aroma detectable. Flavor is more fruity hops, orange juice and grapefruit. A little clean malt sweetness. Dry finish with medium grapefruit bitterness. Medium body and carbonation. Overall this beer is another fruity hop bomb. The color, hazy appearance and citrus aroma instantly creates the impression of a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. This idea persists throughout the flavor and the finish, resulting in a beer that is overwhelmingly citrus oriented. The flavor, body and finish makes a superbly drinkable and interesting beer.

4032,"2017-03-18",4.9,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2017 On tap @ TG, and later that night from a bomber. Pours a hazy, dirty yellow orange juice with pillowy head that leaves amazing lacing. Aroma is super juicy and dank with a mix of orange, mango, pineapple, and candy. Taste is more juicy citrus up front, then into some dank, earthy, citrus, diesel mix. Aftertaste is bitter, mildly pithy, assertive -- then lingers into a complex retronasal that rounds out the experience. Palate is sticky and heavy, which is appropriate for how intensely flavorful this beer is.  This stuff is complex orange and pineapple juice with alcohol, which apparently is what Ive always been looking for in a beer.  My dream is to have this next to King Sue someday, but with my limited knowledge of only having tasted 1,000 beers, this one is my favorite... my deserted island beer.

Ill start this out by stating that Ive never had a NE IPA, but I would imagine that the look of this beer is incredibly similar. Sits in the glass a hazy yellow/orange, almost looks like a glass of pineapple or orange juice. Nice fluffy 2 finger head. Obviously its a double hopped citra so the nose is pineapple, mangos, stone fruit, citrusy juices, and a little bit of orange peels. It tastes almost exactly as it smells, its definitely a juice bomb with the faintest bit of bitterness at the end, maybe the slightest touch of pine. The mouthfeel is incredible. It feels like a smoother, fuller taste. I get this from Decorah Sue as well as King Sue as well, but I believe this one to be even more pillowy. There still is a bit of carbonation and crispness to it as well. Overall, Ive been waiting a while to get my hands on this beer and it definitely lived up to the hype! I saw it listed on the To-Go list on their website this morning so my wife jumped in her car and made the 2 hour drive. This beer is fantastic! I bought 9 bombers of it and am incredibly happy that I did. At 2 days old, they will last me a little while.

4032,"2017-01-25",3.2,"Hazy, murky, light yellow pour. Hoppy yes, expected that. Great another rushed to shelf IPA. Whats the craft in making an ugly hazy mess. Ok, fresh, unfiltered and lets forget about it, we can make money on this. Im assuming its a good thing this flies off the shelf.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

4032,"2016-12-15",4.2,"Bottle in my bedroom... just now.
Pours lookin like orange juice except with plenty of head & a nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is just straight up fruity & dank. Bright fruity and herbaceous hops all over the dang. Sheesh.
 
The flavor is just fantastic, hugely hop forward & juicy, lots of orange zest... some white grape, grapefruit & like actually orange freezy pops. The bitterness is low to medium and the beer is towards the drier end with a touch of honey sweetness.

4032,"2016-06-02",4.1,"Bomber shared by Michael. Pour is cloudy gold with medium white head - just like regular Sue. Aroma is quite intense. The room was filled with mango, citrus, pineaplle, and light floral notes after this was poured. Not surprisingly, the aroma has the same quality as regular Sue, just more robust. I suppose a day old regular Sue may smell this way too. Flavor is good with more citrus, mango, passion fruit, and pineapple. Not all that much different than the regular. Maybe a bit more aromatic but otherwise not too different.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
4032,"2016-06-01",3.5,"Bomber dated 5/24/16 Double Citra, pours a hazy golden/orange with a huge off-white head. Aroma is sweet of tropical and citrus hops light pine resin. Pretty mild taste, light tropical and citrus hops, mellowing malt, mildly sweet, some pine, lacking bitterness. Kind of a let down, Ill take a normal Sue over this any day, FL or IA product. Its not bad by any means, I was just expecting something more complex than the original.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
