1835,"2004-08-16",4.5,"i loved altstadhof schwarzbier but this was still my favourite beer that i had there. amazing passionfruit aroma that is alwazs so inviting in kellerbiers but rare to find in a bock. tasted initially of passiona, little sign of the slightly offensive alcohol of some bocks. seems to have been very well lagered. some plum comes through with some orange pip dryness. not much bitterness there but the sweetness is very pleasant, not sweet or syruppy at all, and this is an amazingly drinkable bock","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
