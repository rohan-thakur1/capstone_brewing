3207,"2017-05-09",3.4,"Bottle into an stemmed lager glass. If only commercial lagers had this flavour. Mild citrus and tropical fruit aroma, white head, decent lacing. Not bitter, but not sweet either - well balanced. A bit like a (nice) mild pale ale, but a much cleaner finish, making the palate shorter, but no less nice. Good beer, worthy of another try.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","DavidAust"
3207,"2016-12-23",3.2,"From 330 mL bottle in shaker. Explosive, gushing pour made it hard to initially judge aroma. Golden leaning toward amber with a bit of sediment (bottle fermentation would explain lively pour). Smooth drinking in the end with some lingering bitterness. Worth another look.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","ANZUShophunter"
3207,"2016-11-26",3.0,"Gushing over flowing head. Not a lot of control there. Orange colour and sweet lager notes.","Canberra ACT, AUSTRALIA","madquacker"
3207,"2016-02-23",2.9,"330 bottle. What was initially worrying was the relative ease with which the cap popped off, that is to say with barely any effort required and almost no sound. The result was a somewhat lifeless looking golden coloured beer with no head to speak of. Fortunately, being English with a fondness for real ale, Im not peturbed by low carbonation so this wasnt entirely dissatisfying. In fact, it was quite good. Grassy, citric hops intermingle with biscuity pale malts across both nose and palate. It tasted fresh, crisp and refreshing despite the appearance and took the edge off a balmy Sydney evening. Light bodied with soft carbonation and a short, low intensity bitterness to finish. Enough character to distinguish itself from more mainstream pale lager offerings.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","sm89walt"
3207,"2016-01-26",3.4,"Australia Day beer #3. 330ml bottle into shaker. Excellent aroma,spice, soy and tomatoes, real umami. Cloudy amber beer, fast and high carbonation, thin white head. Full bodied, zingy bitterness. That umami flavour is around at the bitter end. Interesting. A light lager with little touches bolted on. Good stuff.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","TedE"
3207,"2015-08-28",3.3,"Bottle, old label. Just hazy gold with a white head. Some tropical fruit, but mostly citrus, flowers and spice, crackers. Clean, not all that sweet, less tropical fruit than expected. A little (wheaty?) tanginess. Moderate bitterness. Dry and quite spicy at the end. Try again in summer.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

3207,"2015-06-19",3.5,"Sampled at GABS Sydney. You wouldnt know this was a lager unless you read the description. Nice hoppy beer but still really drinkable. Not bad.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Jmar33"
3207,"2015-06-11",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2015 On tap at the durham. pale straw, creamy head. clean lager base with pleasant hop aroma on top, a little malt in the finish. refreshing, nice. happy to see a craft lager, I hope more brewers experiment like this.","Los Angeles, California, USA","RafeAU"
3207,"2015-06-06",3.5,"Pours a light, clear golden with a fluffy white head. Nose is crisp, grainy, a tiny hint of clove, a little orange peel, maybe a hint of passionfruit. Subtle hops over a crisp malt base. Flavor is a little bit of bitter orange on the mid palate, but overwhelmingly crisp, grainy, lagery throughout, with a dry, slightly carbonic finish. Medium to light body, refreshing and bubbly mouthfeel. This is what a lager should be. This isnt anything insane, but its a very tasty lager with enough hop flavor to keep it interesting. Great!","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Niksko"
3207,"2015-04-27",3.0,"From a bottle. Initially hoppy with a familiar lager finish, interesting and pretty good.","AUSTRALIA","StevieT"
3207,"2015-04-24",3.0,"From 500 ml bottle. Pours a perfectly clear gold with avsmall but lasting white head and moderate carbonation. Aromas of lemon, cut grass, crackers, honey and melon. Taste is a bit more subdued with gentle citrus at first then lifted by a grassy and peppery bitterness. Clean crisp finish with a very mild fruity aftertaste. As pale lagers go, a darn good one.","Camp Hill, AUSTRALIA","Jado"
3207,"2015-03-17",3.1,"Pours gold with a fading head.
Nose shows soft herbal and earthy hops and light malt. Quite restrained.
Flavours include earthy herbal and spicy hops followed by some biscuity malt.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Davros"
3207,"2015-03-17",3.5,"On tap at Tomahawk Bar 280215. Pale lagers seem to be all the rare with Aussie craft brewers at the moment and this one is super clean and has a fair bit of flavour. If only all pale lagers were this good.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
