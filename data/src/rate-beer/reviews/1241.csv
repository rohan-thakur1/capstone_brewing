1241,"2015-02-27",3.8,"Flasche (50 cl) von der Klosterbrauerei, bestellt über Biershop Bayern. - Orangegelb, trüb. - Nase füllig malzsüß mit weicher Hefe und ganz mildem fruchtig-herbem Hopfen im Hintergrund, Noten von Heu und Pfirsichkernen. - Antrunk breit hellmalzig und sehr süß, beinahe zuckersüß, leicht honigartig, aber durch herb-fruchtige Noten (Bittermandel, Aprikose) aufgelockert. Mild rezent, sahnig weich im Mund. Im Abgang deutliche grasige Hopfenbittere, die sich mit der immer noch beträchtlichen Malzsüße reibt. Schwach krautig-herber Nachtrunk. - Sehr malzsüßer Fastenbock mit enormem Restzuckergehalt, trotzdem nicht klebrig süß, sondern dank perfekt abgestimmter fruchtiger Herbe sehr rund und enorm süffig. Eigenwillige aber auf ihre Weise vollkommen überzeugende Bockbier-Variation.","Beijing, CHINA","Moravius"
