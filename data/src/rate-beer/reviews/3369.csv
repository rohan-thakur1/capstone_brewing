First sip yields more citrus hops and a decent toasted malt backbone. Malt seems to fade in middle, though flavor is still quite good. Light to medium bodied.

3369,"2017-04-27",3.5,"Appearance: crystal clear pale gold with one fat finger of fluffy white head diminishing gradually to a thin skim, patchy lacing. (4/5) Aroma: bright citrus, pale malt, pine, floral. (7/10) Taste: moderate sweet, moderate bitter. (7/10) Palate: medium-light body tending slightly thin, moderate to soft carbonation, off-dry short duration bitter slightly sharp finish. (3/5)

Initially this seems like its going to be awesome: theres lots of bright citrus hops on the pour, and the lush white head provides a great contrast to the brilliant gold body. Then - well, it doesnt fall apart, as such, but it gets less awesome. Those bright hops fade almost immediately, the lovely head flattens to a cap and then a skim, and the carbonation falls away. More distressingly, the brew starts to feel slightly thin in the body, and finishes with a hint of sharpness. In short, it falls into the trap that so many Session IPAs seem unable to avoid: of having too light a malt bill and too thin a body to support the hop flavours. Now, that being said, its not my intention to be overly harsh with this - its a perfectly serviceable light ale, and would be perfectly fine to have with lunch on a sunny patio. Its just not the lovely hop bomb it starts off smelling like. (14/20)

3369,"2015-06-12",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
This sessionable Pale Ales juicy citrus fruit and floral angles deliver an easygoing profile with well positioned herbal bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the translucent pale golden.
-Mouthfeel is super lean, which increases drinkability.
-This one lacked a little bite for my tastes in the style. Perhaps a question of freshness?
-Malts offered basic cereal flavors which ably supported the fruity hop aromatics.

Glass: Carton teku.
Appearance: Crystal clear orange/amber body with a foamy white head on top.
Aroma: Big hop aroma of apricot, mango, peach, spicy hops and some sweetness from the malt base. This smells like a double IPA.
Taste: The malt base is prominent and sturdy, bits of caramel and light sweetness make for a fantastic platform for the hops to jump from. The hops are orange, mango, grapefruit, peach and slightly spicy. Very nice!

3369,"2015-04-18",3.4,"Citrusy and hoppy to the nose, one would expect a fruity sweet flavor here. Its a very nice aroma. The head thins pretty quickly, never really foaming up even when vigorously poured. The body appears weak for an IPA. Its closer to a pilsner in its yellowness. Its a clean brew without floaties. The taste is crisp, though the citrus flavor takes a bow to the hops. For something 4.7% ABV, I would have hoped for something less bitter, but this works nicely. The palate is treated to some considerable carbonation, but whats left after it settles is a silky, pleasant coating. Youll be burping up hops quite a bit, but its worth it.

Hope we see a lot more IPAs with that kind of aromatic punch in the coming years. Pours clear orange with light carbonation and a large, dense, rocky cream head. Taste is strongly bitter but not brutal, does have a nice little bit of astringency before the light cracker outro; good pith and rind, its a punchy first stroke that fades quickly rather than lasting (what we get is more earthy-bready malt). Not ""stripped"" like most of the newer smaller IPAs, but the middle is a little hollow, and I would still like a little more malt depth/complexity. Does really nail the hops, though, and theres very faint earth, some pine, faint paper, and herbal-floral notes along with the great citrus. Fullish body but somehow seems more delicate.

3369,"2014-09-29",3.7,"Sampled May 2014
A steady pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a two finger thick, palely tanned, off-white colored head. The beer is a bright, light honey color that shows a brilliantly clear, bright, yellow-gold hue when held up to the light. The aroma has a huge fruit focus to it with notes of kumquat zest, tangelo zest, guava, a bit of mango, and lychee notes in the first pass. A second pass sees a light spiciness accentuating the fruit character with a suggestion of pepper, as well as a bit of earthy herbal character.

The body is very light, and this is peppered with a zippy, prickly carbonation; there is just enough texture to keep this from being watery, but this is definitely a hot-weather, quaffing type beer. This has a firm, biting bitterness from beginning through to the lingering finish. The bright fruitiness of the nose is reduced in the flavor due to the dryness of this beer, but it is still the biggest contributor. Flavors of Meyer lemon zest, kumquat, tangerine zest, essential guava and lychee, as well as a tropical flower nectar character are all quite present. The bitterness has a bit of pine like character and an herbal edge to it that adds some balance to the fruit character. The malt plays a purely supporting role here, with barely a suggestion of pale malt; more an accentuating hay like character than anything, but, perhaps, at times there is a suggestion of saltine cracker like malt character towards the finish.

This is a nice hoppy Pale Ale; it definitely gives me a needed hop fix, and I like that I can easily through a couple of these back without too much affect.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3369,"2014-07-07",3.6,"On tap at Hangar on the wharf, Juneau, AK. 
This was poured into a pint glass. 
The appearance had a super light crisp clear yellow color with a moderate amount of carbonation seen rising to feed a small level coating of a head. The head rather rapidly dissipated for the most part. There were light lacy rings around the sides of the glass. 
The aroma was largely focused around a piney bittering but did allow a fairly nice sweet malt to enter as it warmed. 
The taste was all the way bitter and the sweet malt took an even greater background in the flavor. There was a super dry bitter finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a pretty good sessionable quality about it. The carbonation seemed to be on par for the IPA style as there was just enough harshness but was still not too much of the in your face bitter pounding of my tongue. 
Overall, I say this was a pretty good beer worthy of having again. Is it a session IPA? Well, it sure is.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3369,"2014-06-13",3.6,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip/goblet. It was bottled on 4/14/14 and cost $2.85 ($0.24 per ounce).

Appearance: Straw yellow hue, very hazy but carbonation is visible. Pours to a small, white, foamy head which laces and retains pretty well.

Smell: Strong dry hop aroma of tropical fruit and herbal notes (due to the Mosaic hops Im sure). 

Taste: The American West Coast breweries tend to make great IPAs and double IPAs, though they still havent quite mastered the so-called session IPA yet. Firestone Walker Easy Jack is a good example of what I mean. While its a perfectly fine beer, its not an especially impressive example of the emerging style. 

The description of the brew on the brewerys website indicates a lot of specialty malts were used in brewing this. Its ironic that the base palette is so mild and simple. I get a flavor akin to unsweetened tea, lemon peel and any kind of clear citrusy soda. The hops are of course quite prominent, but are being used for flavor rather than bitterness. They account for the citrus components Im sure, and perhaps a hint of herbal spice, too. I cant help buy find the beer to be a little too mild for its own good, though. Enjoyable for it is, though.

Drinkability: I have mixed feelings on the delivery of Firestone Walker Easy Jack. On one hand the beer is noticeably thin, almost watery, and seems to accentuate the mildness of the brew. On the other hand, it is only 4.5% ABV after all, and its ridiculously easy to drink and is even refreshing for a moment. Theres a slightly dry, lingering aftertaste, but thats washed away by the next swig. If this were drank for its performance value it would definitely perform.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Pours a light straw that even in a session brew appears a little disconcerting. Nose is heavy grapefruit and citrus with a mild malty character. Effervescent on the tongue, mild florals and heavy citrus come to play with malted sweetness to create that interest hop lovers want even in a session brew.

The nose is a huge whallop of hops immediately upon opening the bottle--lots of mango, melon and grapefruit citrus. Heavy bitterness makes this come off bracing and dry as a bone.

3369,"2014-05-22",4.0,"Its light in color, hinting at its thin body and very low caramel malt content. Atop its clear, light golden color is a very airy, bright white head that is the perfect compliment to everything else about the beer. Decorating a basic, clean barley aroma is a fresh, resinous citrus aroma thats gentle, but bold. 

The flavor and mouthfeel are about as perfect as you can get for the style. The dry-hopping was totally necessary here, and reaffirms my belief that almost everything should be dry-hopped. It begins with an acidic, warm tickling of hop delight on the center of the tongue the moment it enters the mouth, followed by an oily coating of that same hop flavor all over the walls of the mouth, finally ending with a fresh, resinous, citrusy, almost coniferous hop-forward finish. Yes, this is all about the hops in the flavor, ans nearly everywhere else. Although its jam packed with hop juice, its not all that bitter. Still, that awesome hop flavor is just enough to make you want to drink this like youd eat a bag of chips. And thats how youre supposed to drink a session IPA.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Some dulled golden amber glow at times in the light. Brighter white head atop stays as a decent filmy layer, laces ok. Aromas are fruity, a firm bitterness meets touches of citrus, gumball and lemon meet florals, grass, touches of bready and cereal malts. Bitter but lacks that big punch, still enjoyable blend. Initial is lighter bodied overall, goes back easy with a middling bitterness off the bat. Florals meet touches of Amarillo citrus fruit, lemon and grapefruit hybrid, a touch of fruit, bread, and florals. Decent bitterness, small body and firm dryness, earth and florals as we start to round the corner stick out. Dry, resiny, a bit earthy as we start to finish with lingering jabs of fruit elements.

Nice to have this one show up so early at Fiddlers. Theyve been serving up some very interesting beers lately. Pours very pale yellow with a modest white head. Served quite warm, this provides an absolutely massive new-school hop aroma, enough to almost make you gag on in a way that even the strongest c-hop bombs never did. Grapefruit, quickly backed with the cat-piss-on-onions that I tend to get from Mosaic and also from what is probably Nelson Sauvin. Ive got a sort of love-hate thing going on here; I love the concept but after the first few sips I definitely prefer my glass of icewater. Fortunately, it gets better and better as my palate--or maybe nose--settles in. Full but not overly aggressive bitterness, a small touch of mineral, grapefruit pith, light but not overly thin on the tongue. Its worth a second glass and that one is rich and interesting enough to sip slowly and make last, impressive at 4.5%. I end with mixed feelings.

Slight popcorn and toast. Flavor is bitter pine, grapefruit, and orange peel. A hint of blueberry muffin. Tons of pineapple and passion fruit, too. Only flaw is a bit of green onion on the finish.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3369,"2014-04-17",3.7,"Draft at sheffields. Hands to firestone for making the best session IPA I have had. Has all quantities of a regular. Well, within reason. Light golden pour. Draft at sheffields. Not much aroma. Taste is fruity bitter hoppy and all around what I'd want in an IPA just slightly lighter. Best possible u could do with this. Will drink this whenever I can find it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","kaser"
3369,"2014-04-15",3.8,"Pours a straw yellow. The first session IPA Ive had that wasnt just an APA. It tasted of malt, bread crust, toast and lots of bitter, pine and citrus malts. Much lighter in flavor and a bit water rather than thick/sticky compared to an IPA (or Union Jack) but was full flavored and without off flavors. This goes down very easy. Well done.","San Francisco, California, USA","badhack"
3369,"2014-04-15",3.8,"Tap at the brewery in Paso during Ranch-a-Thon XIV. Pours a very light yellow with small white head. Aroma is tropical fruit with a slight dank hop. Taste is light and only slightly bitter. No sweetness but some tropical fruit notes. Palate is slightly light but only noticeable when the beer really warms. Get this in cans ASAP!","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"
3369,"2014-04-14",3.6,"12oz bottle pours out a crisp golden topped with a small white head. Nose is nice tropical fruit pine and some citrus. Taste is nice citrus bread malts and a touch of bitterness on the end. This is a nice and easy drinking brew.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
3369,"2014-04-12",3.8,"I like this! Its great for a nice hoppy brew with low alcohol %. The aroma is great! Fresh piney and citrus hops with a hint of stone fruit. The taste is somewhat less but still very flavorful for a light brew. The finish is light and slightly watery, but thats to be expected. You wont run over the flowerbed on the lawnmower with this one.","Chevy Chase, Washington DC, USA","Doofgoblin"
3369,"2014-04-12",3.7,"12 oz bottle, thanks Poisoneddwarf- Pours clear light golden with loads of carbonation bubbles and a thin yet lasting white head. Aroma is grapefruity hops, spicy, sweet malt. The taste is light malt, dry, hoppy, pine and citrus. Solid, can it please.","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"
3369,"2014-04-12",3.8,"12 oz bottle from a six pack bought at Super 1 in Post Falls, ID. Aroma is all grapefruit, all the time. Pours clear golden with a large white head with good retention, leaving lace. Taste is bittersweet and citrusy, finishing with a lingering, but not severe, bitterness. Body is thin--to style--finely carbonated. Nice and well-crafted.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
3369,"2014-04-11",3.9,"Pour out of 12 oz bottle, clear-slightly hazy golden pour with white head, aroma brought notes of onion, some pine, orange, grass, spice, hints of grain, hints of white grape. Taste is a mix of grass, pine, earth, some orange, white grape, hints of earth into a bit of biscuit, bread, finishing slightly bitter, dry. Very chuggable, good summer brew.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
3369,"2014-04-11",3.3,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2014 Bottle. Clear burnt gold with a short white head. Lemon drop and pineapple juice, candied garlic and chive aroma. Medium-light body with a syrupy, filmy viscosity. Finish of bitter lemon peel and Warheads sour candies. Off-dry, somewhat husky and astringent malt carried by juicy hops.  It succeeds because the point is Union Jack at 4.5%, and it seems  in line with that minus the strong pine sap and plus a stronger white wine and garlic quality.  Id give it high marks in competition but I wont buy it regularly.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3369,"2014-04-11",3.6,"Grabbed a sixer of this. 12 oz bottle pours a bright, clear golden with a fizzy white head and nice lacing. Bready malts, citrusy hops on the nose. Balanced, sweet and hoppy flavor. Clean, well-made. Only nice things to say about this beer.","Colorado, USA","That1Guy"
3369,"2014-04-10",3.6,"Bottle - a really balanced and subtle session ipa, with equal emphasis put on the malts, which are soft, bready, lightly sweet - hops are present but balanced, not over the top and assertive, as can often be the case in these beers - lightly peppery, slightly grassy, moderately tropical, with a hint of white grape - immensely quaffable - nice.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
3369,"2014-04-09",3.9,"On tap at Cheeky Monk. Pour is clear straw with a frothy white head and great lacing. Tropical fruity aroma - orange, mango, and pineapple - ligh grass, biscuit, and straw. Taste is pine, grapefruit peel, straw, oranges, grass, and dough with a medium bitter finish. Fruity and grassy, well-balanced and dry. Great session IPA.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
3369,"2014-04-08",3.9,"11 day old bottle, pours clear gold with medium white head. Settles quickly with minimal lacing. Aroma is light citrus, piney, floral hops. Flavor is mellow citrus hop, tangerine and orange rind, mildly piney hop finish. Melloww, fruity and sweet hops. Hops were mild but very fresh thanks to the young bottle. Very tasty for a session IPA. Soft carbonation, medium-light body, and a juicy texture. Very drinkable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Brouwerij"
3369,"2014-04-07",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2015 355ml bottle. 9 days old. Pours a super clear and effervescent light gold, stunning beer. The smell is tropical fruits, citrus, and backing grain. Flavor is acidic and tropical hops, pretty high bitterness for the abv, plenty of bready malt flavors too. It goes down like water, but still waiting for the perfect session ipa. Edit: Drank a ton of this lately, it gets better and better, score raised.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
