2689,"2016-10-16",4.0,"500 ml bottle from Prost. Murky brown in color, thin fast dying head. Does it matter what it looks like?? Aroma is awfully nice; light maple syrup, coffee bean, and light bourbon.

2689,"2016-10-03",4.4,"12.7% ABV. Strong Ale.

Poured out deep Amber brown. 28¬∫SRM.

Nose has some very pleasant sweet rich dessert aromas: banoffee, pecan pie, praline pecans with the creamy rich body of a pumpkin pie. There are rich toffee, treacle aromas in the nose as well. Creme brule√© comes to mind with vanilla, caramel, burnt sugar. As the brew comes up to room temperature, you start to get less of the sweet and more of the nutty, bready and cake-like aromas with sweet dough, cookie dough, fresh biscuits, waffles and pancakes with maple syrup.

Mouthfeel is syrupy and alcohol. Palate has maple syrup, wild honey, toffee and treacle and a bunch of creamy flavors like burnt milk scorched cream before the onset of the aggressive alcoholic palate and then you get alcoholic, earthy and woody hops a slide into a thinner sweet that is reminiscent of maple sugar and then slightly bitter hops with a woody character suggesting incense or wormwood.

The finish is pleasantly and numbingly gentle.

2689,"2016-10-01",4.2,"500 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in a Great Lakes snifter, the beer pours a murky reddish/brown color with about an inch tan head that stuck around for a long time. There¬ís also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like maple, bourbon, vanilla, candied oranges, oak, coffee and a bit of piney hops. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there¬ís also some molasses, woodiness, citrus peel and dark fruit noticeable too, along with a bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it¬ís syrupy and a bit slick with a moderate amount of carbonation.

2689,"2016-08-14",3.8,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a tall tulip. Kind of a murky, hazy amber with a tan head of tiny bubbles. Nose is immediately caramel, vanilla, and maple with a slight waft of booziness. Upon tipping the glass back I quickly notice that the maple barrel aging adds a sweetness that cuts the anticipated alcohol burn (12.7% ABV) to a near nothing. Lightly bitter, medium body, and creamy on the palate with rather soft carbonation. Virtually no lacing on the glass (guessing due to the alcohol?), but the hops come through with a nice bitter finish and leaves me with my lips being rather sticky. I love that. Stone has come up with a great twist on the American Strong Ale. Perfect for a cold night with a cigar by the fire.","California, USA","mezr"
2689,"2016-08-06",3.7,"Compmex and enjoyable taste of bourbon, coffee, maple. A little bit of an odd aftertaste that i would have rathered not be there. Alcohol os noticeable without being dominant. Full body. Good but not great.","New Jersey, USA","demannu"

2689,"2016-07-27",3.9,"50cl corked and caged bottle pours with a murky mahogany colored body that supports a tan head of foam. The aroma offers up malts, malty pine hops, vanilla, soft yet spicy oak, pine sap covered biscuit malts, chocolate and then some booziness into the end of the draw. The taste delivers rich flavor where smooth rich sweet malt quickly runs into whiskey booze to start. Toward midway it picks up sweet vanilla, marshmallow, some spicy oak and plenty of near resiny pine hop bitterness. Into the finish the vanilla, soft smooth whiskey, some thin chocolate malts and spicy oak slowly close out the experience.

Fresh green, peppery hop combining with fresh coffee and pistachio. Nutty coffee beans, cocoa and maple syrup down below. Altogether very woody, like split fresh wood. Nose is different every time we revisit. Bizarre flavor progression: sharp oak, toffee, maple, green leafy hops, then coffee, alcohol, back to bourbon and vanilla, then after a couple beats bitterness and alcohol kick in. Seems a little thrown together, there¬ís no real moment of clarity. Flavors ping pong around.
