Moderately sweet, medium bodied, bitterness on the low side of medium. The interplay between the hops and blood oranges is really very nice, particularly at the finish. Its just so careless with the alcohol - costs it .2 or .3 for me.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

The taste is a sweet, sour blood orange blast with a nice hop underpinning that is compulsively drinkable yet flavorful and complex. This is a favorite of mine and I wish it was year round cause I would drink it all the time.

4258,"2017-04-06",3.5,"My bottle of this was probably a little too old to be ideal, but I still thought it tasted good. It poured bright orange with average head. The aroma is sweet, tangy blood oranges up front, but a sweet wheat malt is still there in the bakcground. The flavor is mostly about the sweet citrus. Its very sweet, but not bad at all. The finish is mild and malty, and if the hop character isnt as bright as it might have been, its probably because I let this bottle set a little too long. Id like to have this again fresh.","Virginia, USA","Darwenus"

And after looking at the label, I can see its blood orange juice added. Yea, blood orange. Flavor is very sharp grapefruit rind, blood orange bitterness, pine. Its pretty hoppy bitter finish. That blood orange is pretty bitter. Nose feels a little adjuncty mostly because the aroma is just too obviously blood orange, flavor less so. Solid.

Finger-width fizzy white head with poor retention and no lacing. Taste is initial confusion of non-distinct bitter and sweet, with latter half sweet orange.

Dunno what this is hopped with - my Google-fu fails on that count - but whether its Citra, Simcoe, or whatever, Im getting a touch more cattiness (garlic/onion/vegetal) than I prefer. Not a whole lot, but enough that I cant rate this any higher. Other than that, a solid brew. Ive called it an APA here, since the label just calls it a Pale, but it bridges styes with A/IPA: the colour and body are APA-ish, but the ABV and flavour are definitely beefy enough to be considered an A/IPA. Then again, despite the higher ABV, it drinks like a session ale. I guess, call it a Pale and have done with it? (15/20)","CANADA","UXO"

Not sure why it has taken so long to pull the trigger on this one, but I picked it up today. Looking forward to it because Lagunitas is one of my favorite breweries (top 5 with my overall rating) and Im digging this one-hitter series. Dont know much about this one in particular, but still expecting it to be good.

Poured a golden, pale, clear color with 3-to-4 fingers of rocky, white head. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Good amount of foamy layered lacing on the sides of the glass. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.50)

Smelled sharp, juicy citrusy notes from the beginning with tropical notes coming in late. Specifically got tangerine, blood orange, red grapefruit, nectarine, peach, lemon zest, lime, passion fruit, pineapple, caramel sweetness that is normal to Lagunitas beers and some danky pine. (Smell - 4.00)

Taste arguably was better with first mouthful. Cant believe how juicy this is, getting blood orange, nectarine, sweetened iced tea with lemon, red grapefruit, passion fruit, mango, pineapple, watered down pulpy orange juice, apricot (more than peach), stone fruit and some caramel sweetness. (Taste - 4.25)

Light body. Oily texture. Average carbonation. Long, citrusy finish. (Feel - 4.00)

This was a very nice American Pale Ale. Im pretty sure if I would have reviewed this as an IPA, the ratings wouldnt have been as good. Reminding me somewhat of a Maine Company beer. Would like to see a collab there. (Overall - 4.25)

4258,"2016-04-22",2.8,"Bottle. Clear gold with a big sudsy white head that has excellent retention. The aroma is soft with mixed citrus. The taste was also mixed citrus dominated by oranges. There was also a distracting onion, chemically component to the taste that really bugged me. The palate is full and sticky. Overall: I think I got a bad batch, never before have I been disappointed by a Lagunitas beer.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"

P- Medium body, average texture, average carbonation, balanced finish.

O- Maybe one of my new favorite IPAs. Solid beer with the right amount of citrus that makes for a very juicy and refreshing brew. Not too bitter or aggressive. I drank this like it was 3% not 8%. Now I just need another.","Ravenna, Nebraska, USA","HuskerTan"
4258,"2016-04-20",4.3,"2015 BJCP Category: 18B American Pale Ale
AROMA: Strong citrusy hop aroma, especially orange and grapefruit. IPA-level hoppiness in the nose. No malt presence. Clean and bright. 10/12APPEARANCE: Dark gold to amber proper hue. Mostly clear but particulates float in suspension. Average, white, foamy head. Good retention and lacing. 2/3FLAVOR: Strong bitterness right away. Citrusy hop flavor is quite strong with some grassy notes on the second half and aftertaste. Some blood orange taste comes through at the end. Base malt is mostly nondeScript. General amber/blonde character but not especially sweet. IBUs probably too high for the style, but otherwise enjoyable. 16/20MOUTHFEEL: Medium+ body. Fairly crisp. Some lingering bitterness, but its tolerable. No alcohol warmth. Feels lighter than the ABV. 5/5OVERALL IMPRESSION: Interesting and impressive brew: an imperial pale ale with blood orange juice. Hoppy and bitter enough to be considered a standard IPA. Not fruity enough to be a fruit beer proper. 8/10TOTAL SCORE: 43/50","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
4258,"2016-04-20",3.5,"A good brew but a bit too sweet and lacking punch for me. Delightful aroma of orange, citrus juices and a light zesty hop note, mild pine. Light caramel and bready malts a bit of toast and a pinch of spice with a leafy green hop. Citrus throughout without a ton of biterness. Juicy and a touch too sweet.","Alberta, CANADA","patricks110"

4258,"2016-04-16",3.5,"Shaker pint draft at Yard House in Addison, Texas. The pour is mostly clear darker golden with a one inch fizzy off white head. The aroma is bright citrus orange, floral hop and a bit of caramel malt. The taste is strong on the blood orange flavor right away, bright and tart, balanced with the floral, finishing with mineral caramel malt.

4258,"2016-04-15",3.5,"12 oz. Bottle. Purchased at Prost, North Hampton, NH. Aroma is pretty bright with pink grapefruit rind, blood orange, tangerine. Wow! 
Pale malts and wheat provide the base. Pine hops are in conflict with the citrus hops. Pine wins out a bit and is lightly astringent. I wish the flavor was as bright with citrus as the nose. Medium body with lively carb. I loved the aroma but the battle of citrus and pine in the flavor didnt totally win me over. Still worth a pint and it could fair better on draft.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

4258,"2016-04-14",3.5,"Pours a medium gold with yeast bits. Light head. Smell is kinda minerally, little sweet caramel, some almost minty orange tart floral. Taste is same but fairly malty but not sweet malty, tart orange citrus. Cant say I would like this say it would be 5% abv, because the malt body makes up for that in this.

4258,"2016-03-23",4.3,"Sweet citrusy Jesus! Ive had a few blood orange IPAs before but never anything with as much concentrated juiciness as CitruSinensis (I can barely type that name - saying it is completely out of the question). Burnt orange coloring. Aroma isnt as big youd expect but has the expected blend of citrusy notes from hops and blood orange. Flavor is a beautiful balance of the two. Sweet, tangy orange with bright, bitter hops. Sometimes, even when done well, adding fresh fruit to a hopped-up ale seems like a wasted effort. CitruSinensis isnt like that.

Lemon and grapefruit juice pour out of the glass. Absolute citrus taste. I get a lot more lemon than grapefruit, and not sour, but the citrus aspect is unmistakable. I dont really get the blood oranges which is kind of surprising. Theres no malt to speak of. Its dry and refreshing as hell.

4258,"2016-03-19",3.7,"12oz bottle. 2/15/16 bottle date. Appearance: Light golden with a thick white foam head. While its relatively clear, its a snow globe of what Im guessing is pulp material. Not all that inviting. 
Aroma: Punch in the face of citrus and tropical fruit hippiness. 
Aroma: Fresh pressed orange juice with a touch of acidic tartness. Light malt sweetness behind the orange juice, and a sharp citric bitterness. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation. No alcohol warmth apparent. 
Finish: Dry, with a citric bitterness and touch of acidity. 
Overall: A citrus bomb from start to finish. Great aroma and flavor all the way through. OJ adds some acidity and tartness to balance the citrus flavor. The one thing I dont understand is why they dont filter the pulp out. You can still get the flavor without it, and it is offsetting on the appearance.","","TH28"

Aroma is citrus and orange zest but not overpowering. Taste is initially weak orange juice and bitter but transitions into a dry finish with a noticeable tartness. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. On paper this sounded like a beer I would love but it just doesnt do it for me. I dont think it is the orange because I am a huge fan of Schlaflys Tasmanian IPA which definitely has a taste leaning towards orange but that is the result of the galaxy hops and not added juice. Maybe that is the difference. This beer just seemed to be lacking something to me.","Delaware, USA","GSH1976"
4258,"2016-03-18",4.2,"This was poured into a becher pint glass. 
The appearance was a nice looking golden color. Beautiful transparency allows light carbonation to run up at a moderate pace. Slim fingers worth of white foamy head dissipated at a nice pace. Light messy lacing sticks all around the glass. 
The smell had a sweet blood orange juicy citrus bitterness running into subtle bitter grassy to grapefruit tones.
The taste was basically the same with a subtle dry to wet citrus aftertaste sliding into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a spectacular sessionable sweet sticky feel to it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the sweetness to be some of the stickiness all about it. Still, a nice smoothness all about.
Overall, the hype is real, this was so damn good. Wish I had a couple more bottles.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
4258,"2016-03-17",4.5,"The body of the beer was clear, pale golden, possessed fine carbonation bubbles, and formed a two finger thick head.  This is about as picture perfect as a beer gets.  I was expecting a citrus assault based on the formula of the beer, due to the inclusion of blood orange juice.  This beer did not smell very citric to me, the way that Ballast Point Grapefruit Sculpin or Terrapin Walking Dead Blood Orange IPA did.  The aroma was mostly typical for a pale ale, with just a touch of citrus, that could very well be mistaken for more hops.  The taste is where the orange juice showed up in a big way.  There was a concentrated orange sourness at the beginning of each sip.  The sourness gave way to orange pith bitterness mid palette, and the finish was a long drawn out taste of blood orange.  This tasted simply fabulous to me.  The body was medium dense, and the ABV was absolutely invisible.  This could easily be mistaken for a sub 5% ABV session ale.  After that lackluster smell, I was not expecting a beer this good.  Well done Lagunitas.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

4258,"2016-03-02",4.2,"Location: 12 oz bottle from Hoboken Vine, 3/2/16. 


Aroma: The aroma of this beer is full of fruit and fruity hops. It is obviously lead by the blood orange, which comes through nicely for a really enjoyable, fruity aroma

Appearance: Clear golden-orange in color, small off-white head, sticky / drippy lacing 

Flavor: The blood orange adds a nice citrusy tartness to the hoppy bitterness of the base beer

Palate: Drinks super easy and clean, hides the 7.9% way too well, and finishes tart, dry

Overall Impression: 
The flavor combination works quite well. The ABV is way too well hidden (Id have guessed it at closer to 5% than bordering on 8%). Just a very nice beer. In the run of fruited APAs, IPAs, and DIPAs that we are currently enjoying as a society, this may very well be my favorite. Really good stuff.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

The first sip is tart, rounded with a malty foundation that sooths the initial bite, but leaves me with a odd aftertaste. Nothing spectacular about this for me, and, in fact, a bit of a bummer. I usually like Lagunitas for a go to beer, no matter the style, and this one wont make the list.

4258,"2015-06-22",3.7,"Draft. Translucent tangerine with a wispy white cap. The aroma is like an orange fallen to earth -- zesty peel met with moist earth. Dollops of honey and dank weed round the bouquet out. The flavor is almost sour with tongue-clasping blood orange acidity, but becomes slightly more balanced mid-palate as the brews citrusy hops rise. The orange addition is just slightly distracting, and a splash more juice would make it unpleasant. Its an interesting twist on one of my Lagunitas favorites, but not one that I think Id enjoy more than a glass of.","","PartyFowle"

A little dankness. Med body or so. Flavor is a mix of dank and fresh citrus -which isnt lemon or lime, so must be orange. The dank tends to displace the citrus and coat the tongue. The ""juice"" part is very fresh. With time things seem more orange to me. Its certainly a change. Just noticed I didnt notice malt. Hmm. The juice and hop seem to have obliterated it for the most part. Time to stop. I think one hit is about right. I dont feel Id want to drink a great deal of this.

Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of bright citrus/piney hops, blood orange, and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness and slight fruit tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon/orange peel, pine, honey, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/piney hops, blood orange, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an excellent fruited pale ale. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/piney hops, blood orange, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV.
