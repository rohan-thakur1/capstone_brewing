Je précise en fût car jai souvent bu eu loccasion de boire cette bière en bouteille et son look me semblait beaucoup moins clair. Enfin. Beaucoup darômes de muscade au nez, dépices, de coriandre en grains. Une belle quantité de pain certes, mais ce sont les épices qui dominent ici. Texture lisse en bouche. Un corps très agréable où la bulle suit la douce cadence imposée par le blé. Les épices se calment en bouche pour faire place à des fruits bien frais accompagnés dune mie de pain ménage. Ce fût ne me paraît pas conforme aux souvenirs que je me faisais de cette bière que jai souvent bu et cest la raison pour laquelle je me dois de la déguster à nouveau, un projet qui me plaît déjà.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

Flavor was initially quite mild, but soon revealed accents of clove, coriander, grains of paradise, and other spices (leaning more herbal).  Beyond the spicy notes, there was a mild sweetness but little else.  Finish was medium in length, with yeasty flavors.  Overall, this brew continues my hunch that Charlevoix can really craft some complex, subtly-flavored Belgian beers.

Curacao? Just more corriander? Very floral. A little soapy, but not in an off way. Definitely not clove, something surely is different, but in a good way.

4599,"2004-05-17",3.0,"Huge orange coloured head, fast dwindling, above a beer, the perfect colour of apricotskin. Blasts of coriander out of the glass remind me of an industrial kitchen preparing soup. Yeasty, meaty aromas complete the picture. Spicey, leafy, soupy taste, dominated by coriander. Completely unidimensional because of this dominance. The beer-base tries to get from underneath, with some apparently good malt, but its no use. Well-bodied. Slightly oily, nearly fatty mouthfeel. One of the few good things about ""witbier"" IMO, is that it can be (citrussy) refreshing. No way with this corianderextract. It *has* character - but not one I want to marry.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
4599,"2004-05-13",3.5,"Medium, creamy white head sustained by strong carbonation. Blonde, slightly cloudy color. Very appealing orange aroma with spices, maybe yeast too. Interesting, refreshing flavors of orange and wheat, its very slightly tart also. Very smooth mouthfeel.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"

4599,"2004-04-25",4.3,"This is easily the best wit I've had out of the bottle. It's surprisingly orange, but the haze is still there. Great aromas of orange, yeast, and spices. The flavors get even more complex, with notes of lemon, coriander, ginger, and black pepper.  It comes back to earth a bit on the palate, as it seems too carbonated and lacks the smoothness that I tend to associate with this style. Still, this is one hell of a beer. Big Time thanks to Lubiere for this one!","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
4599,"2004-04-21",3.6,"Pours a cloudy pale golden with a thick lacy white head.  Bready Belgian yeast aroma has a nice spice profile and malty backbone. Body is smooth and malty with a good balance of coriander and citrus spice.  Finishes dry and mildly bitter with a touch of pepper.  Thanks Rastacouere!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
4599,"2004-04-18",3.0,"Bottle pours a slightly hazy golden color, moderate fizzy white head that quickly settles to a thin film, abundant carbonation, with virtually no lacing.   Light wheat, very light wheat, along with minor orange, lemon, and yeast notes.   Could stand to be spicier.   Forwardly yeasty and wheaty.   Very little in the way of citrus or witbier like flavors.   Somewhat thin in the middle, both in body and in taste.   Slight yeasty/citrusy flavor before the finish, but its gone before you can begin to appreciate it.   Overall, a bit thin and not as flavorful as I would have liked, but its drinkable.   Thanks goes out to Rastacouere for the trade!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
4599,"2004-03-30",3.7,"(500ml bottle) Pours a medium, white head and a orangy-gold body. Much like the Triple the nose is of wheat. Flavours of lemon, wheat, oranges and yeast. Very nice. Not as complex as many I've tried but a very strong performer indeed. I look forward to trying this one again!","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
4599,"2004-03-29",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2004 Re-rate: With full-carbonation, I bumped up the scores for appearance, mouthfeel and overall impression. New sample pours a generous white head atop a deep dark golden body. Head lasts nicely and eventually recedes to cover. Good carbonation. Refreshing, lively mouthfeel.

Original rating 9-3-9-2-16=3.9: Citrus - lemon and orange, coriander, yeast aromas. Deep dark golden honey colour with nice white head that dissipates rather quickly. Flavour is incredible sweet and tart interplay wonderfully - orange, lemon, apple, pear, coriander, chamomile, bready yeast, biscuit, fresh cut straw. Flavour builds nicely as you drink. Fairly full mouthfeel but carbonation is a bit low. I'm hoping the next bottle will have stronger carbonation as the aromas and flavour on this one are absolutely fantastic. Bottle.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
4599,"2004-03-22",4.4,"An amazing, out of this world witbier! Bright, yeasty herbal (subtle coriander) aroma. Ton of lemongrass balanced by harvested-yesterday wheat. Also notes of rye, thyme, dried pear and oats. Mellow, soft grain, semi-dry finish.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
4599,"2004-03-18",4.4,"Cloudy honeyed amber. Mountainous white foam with spacious bubbles. Stunning aroma of lemon, herbs, honeydew, and coriander. Light hints of dough and sweet orange peels.  Phenolic, banana esters and airiness highlight the gorgeous hop undertones. Extremely bright and uplifting. Fluffy carbonation with lots of effervescence. Mellow and elegant phenolic notes in the flavor. Honeydew and herbal notes come on strong before the doughy pale malts appear. Noble hops add a touch of juicy sweetness at the back of the throat, countering the esters and agitating the softly spicy hops. Scrubbing effervescence dries out the finish before a late coriander dusting and spicy hop flourish. Endless straw, coriander and waxy yeast flavors accompany the tongue-tickling esters and airy, phenolic belches. Immensely appetizing, and, without question, one of most elegant witbiers on the face of the planet. Youre a saint, Rasta!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
4599,"2004-03-14",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2004 Very cloudy dark orange beer. Nice white head that fades quickly. Strong, fruity and spicy nose.

4599,"2004-03-03",3.4,"500 ml bottle.  Ridiculously voluminous head tops a bright, nearly clear golden body.  Light yeasty-banana nose, little spice.  On the tongue, much hotter and spicer, pepper and coriander and orange; with a thick body and high carbonation.  Only lightly sweet, very mellow and smooth at the front with heavy acidity later.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
4599,"2004-03-02",3.5,"Cloudy orange with a bubbly white head. Spicey - coriander and pepper and yeast but not as much banana as some witbiers. Carbonated to the point of being tongue-tingling, but with a smooth finish of citric acidity and bitterness. Not bad.","Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA","beerhugger"
4599,"2004-03-02",3.9,"The grayest wit since John's Generations. Light in body (until the cloudy end) but doesn't look it. The most coriandered wit I've had - this will actualy make your tongue tingle. Pepper, very little banana sweetness (although some white sugar at the close of the sip) or acidity (lemon) -instead just flat out huge pepper and spice and I like it!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
4599,"2004-02-27",3.4,"Murky orange in colour.  Aroma is very spicy, with yeast, oranges and bananas.  Flavour was slightly dry, spicy, with bananas, lemons, oranges and some pepper.  Finish is smooth, mild bitterness, slightly dry.  Very well made but I guess that I am just not a huge fan of this style.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","radiomgb"
4599,"2004-02-12",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2005 This is a wild beer. Not your conventional White beer. The color is not truly like a white, it is much too orange to be considered a white. However, at the opening, there is excellent coriander, orange and banana, all typically found in a white. But the real surprise is in the finish. The slower you drink this beer, the better it gets! In the end, the flavors where so good, this beer felt like a dubbel!","Quebec, CANADA","PrimeMinister"
4599,"2003-09-21",3.6,"Cloudy orange colour, not much head but one heck of a carbonation.  Strong banana, coriander and lemon aroma with a hint of sulphur unfortunately.  A mix of coriander and orange in the flavour, long bready, yeasty finish, some peppery notes.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","SimonPatrice"
4599,"2003-08-27",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 2, 2004 typical white beer appearance. I've split the bottle with my mother and she loved it. It looked much hazier in her glass (Blanche de Bruxelles flute) than mine (some kind of 0.2L tumbler mug). Anyway, the head is initially very generous with well laced bubbles, but it swiftly quits the glass to leave just a thin white ring through the tasting. Also, it's the most carbonated witbier I've ever seen. When putting my nose close to it to smell, I actually heard the bubbles bursting like it does with a fresh coca-cola. Needless to say it was surprisingly biting the tongue a bit for a white (not saying that as an unpleasant default, just a remark). The aroma is appealing with heaps of coriander. Very tasty lemon and orange are also part of the meeting like 2 lifetime friends. The mouthfeel is not so full though, one step under Hoegaarden in that department. Typical light acidity complements the sweet and spiced fruitiness to make this a perfect refreshing successful beer.  2nd batch: darker, a little lighter bodied, the same spiced profile I love, but overall, this seems less interesting than last time. Perhaps because it's in the middle of the winter? I'm not changing the score anyhow, maybe this summer","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
