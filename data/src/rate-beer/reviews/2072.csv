2072,"2016-05-20",3.8,"Bottle at t Kasteelhof in the charming hilltop city of Cassel, France on Aug. 2014: Clear golden. Fine-bubbled sticky white head persists nicely. Phenolic and lemon zesty nose also boasts peach skin, grassy herbs, pepper, flowers and new-mown hay. Very subtle note of resin and raw hops. Soft and relaxed carbonation. Vibrant hops show a smidgeon of greenness as theyre cradled by pillowy pils malt and a succulent fruity ester push. A firm-edged toastiness underlies the softer textures and highlights the ripe melon notes. Forceful phenolic burst trails the vital crispness of the pils malt. A wealth of bright hop oils match the fine-tuned bitterness splendidly, although a hint of resin does make an appearance. Cleanly expressed malt fills the mouth with hay-dust textures, as an assertive hop charge of pepper, grassy herbs and lemon zest seals the admirably dry finish. A hopcentric rustic golden ale whose only shortcoming is the slightly ""green"" hoppiness. Otherwise terrific balance and quite elegant. Easy to enjoy.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Non pas une bière de garde, mais une belgian ale, par respect pour le verre dEname que jai 
utilisé pour la déguster !!! Et puis on aime bien taquiner nos amis chtis
Blonde artisanale donc du pays flamand, parce que la Flandre va aussi en France, eh oui, amis 
du centre, du sud ouest ou autre costa de azuro 
Dailleurs le brasseur a trouvé le slogan ad hoc : « pensez global, consommez local »  qui disait.
Sont fous ces chtis ..
Couleur dorée soutenue et brillante, avec un léger trouble de levure (voulu au versage).
Bulles moyennes par dizaines, partout dans le verre, vives.
Mousse blanche crémeuse, qui tient en nappage bien crémeux à 2 mm.
Arômes de malt clair, un autre bien grillé, houblon, pointe de beurre, butterscotch, levure.
1ère bouche bien soyeuse, au très bel ensemble mat/houblon, et une pointe dépices.
Arrière-bouche de caractère, déjà à léquilibre.
2ème à lexcellente harmonie malt/houblon.
Arrière-bouche longue et complexe, très belle amertume.
3ème avec une belle présence dune amertume précise, nette.
Arrière-bouche de très grand caractère.
Longueur qui développe les saveurs, avec du houblon très joli, des fruits blancs, du tabac blond.

Levure précise, amère, un peu épicée, très belle ligne.
Alcool de très bon niveau, progressif, soutien manifeste à lensemble.
Finale avec un nez superbe, une grande finesse des saveurs et du style ..
CONCLUSION : une belgian ale de chNord qui na pas à rougir de ses voisins du Nord (encore plus au nord  je sais, cest compliqué, mais chacun sait de qui on parle  enfin, dans le Nord
en tous les cas ). Fin de la parenthèse, non sans féliciter fortement ces nordistes flamands ...Je sais, cest compliqué, mais si on va à Gand (Gent) ou à Bruges (Brugge) en passant par la braderie de Lille (Rijsel), on risque darriver à comprendre !!!

2072,"2013-10-17",3.8,"In short: A yeasty blonde ale with grassy-flowery hops. Decent beer.
How: From a bottle at Montreal Mondial 2013.
The look: Cloudy blonde body topped by an enormous white head, not a true gusher but it took a very loooonnnnng time to pour, it was just foam.
In long: After an eternity, multiple fall-foam pours each creating a little bit of beer Nose is hop-forward in an unusual way, it has dry grass, sundried countryside flowers, vanilla ice-cream, watermelons, bubblegum. Body had a foamy texture with a lots of big bubbles, an overall sponge-like mouthfeel. Taste proposes an elusive body, a fluffy yeasty mixture, some fresh bakery bread, a light honey presence, leading to a hoppy finish that is very scented/flowery and somewhat grassy. Too much of an overall perfume sensation but enjoyable nonetheless. Currently classified on ratebeer as an IPA, this is certainly not your usual IPA by ratebeer standards, more like a Belgian blonde ale that is more hoppy than usual. After drinking so many beers at the Mondial beer festival I had a strange dream, I dreamt it was raining beer outside, and in my dream I stayed inside to stay warm and dry, and now Im questioning everything I thought I knew about myself.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2072,"2013-01-25",3.3,"33cl bottle from Terre de Boissons Calais.  Drunk from the bottle on the train home. Golden beer.  Hoppy strong belgian blonde aroma. Yeast is definitely Belgian. Yes its hoppier than normal and has some American style sherberty hops. I wasnt convinced it was an ipa more a strong belgian due to the yeast character. However the more I had of it the more it became an ipa. Good but with that Belgian twang. Clean American hops pale malt and characterful yeast I dont think always make good bedfellows. Good but I dont think it hangs together","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

2072,"2012-12-28",3.8,"330ml bottle. Pours hazy golden, lots of activity in the glass, nice white cloudy head which settles to a small residue atop the beer fairly quickly. Pungent, sweet resiny hops in the aroma, floral notes, some lemon/lemon zest and lime. Big dose of summer fruits (raspberry?!) in the flavour, backlit by more sharp hop bitterness. Medium carbonated and a little lively in the mouth, Alcohol is slightly apparent. Finish is long, dry and fruity. My first French craft beer, very pleasant.","Dublin, IRELAND","ciaranc"

2072,"2012-09-11",3.6,"333 from La Cave à Bulles. Opens a bit of a foamer. Not violent, but vigorously trying to leave. Nice aroma of floral, and perhaps earthy, hop. Med body. Flavor is floral hop - a lot of that- and some Belgian yeast/spice. Banana ester at low level. The Belgian aspect somewhat obscures the hop, but the finish retains a nice fresh floral aspect.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
2072,"2012-09-10",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 30, 2012 Bottle from Celliers des Arcades, Arras. Hazy gold with a small white cap. Aroma is very fruity and impressive hop presence, pears, banana, and lots of awesome peach. Flavour is even better, same fruity elements, but the sweetness is kept in check by the hop presence and the dry yeast character. Finishes well with lingering esters. Super enjoyable, Ill have to pick up a 750mL bottle when I can. A simply awesome Belgian-style IPA.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

2072,"2012-03-16",2.9,"Bottle, unexpectedly discovered in the beer menu of Olympen, Oslo. This is my 1789th rating, so I found it very appropriate to select a French beer in honor of their revolution. :-) Pours a clear pale golden body with a big creamy white head. Nose is grass, pale malts and hints of soap and something I can only describe in terms of the classic Norwegian candy ""bruspulver""; a sort of fizzy, grape-like sweetness. Weird. Taste is alcoholic phenols, strong banana tones, herbs and light candy sugars. Hints of soap and bubble gum. A bit strange all in all, not too bad but certainly nothing to start a revolution over.

2072,"2010-07-27",3.6,"A beautiful Belgian white foam covers the cloudy opaque, yet shining gold. Bready and rather timid, yeasty nose with soft floral aromatics. A little underwhelming there for a wannabe IPA. In mouth, the palate starts with a healthy, balanced breadiness and well extracted cerealic flavours. growing in the background is a balanced hop-yeast combo that brings leafy, green, tea-like flavours that procure fruitiness and a lightly citrusy acidity that refreshes. Well integrated alcohol whispers. A balanced offerings with subtle corners that ends in dryness with a mineral and relatively long yet unagressive bitterness. Pretty active carbonation that fits the Belgian style all along. Well done.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
