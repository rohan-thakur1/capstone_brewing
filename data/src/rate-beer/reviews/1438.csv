Nice body, and nice lingering bitterness, dry. These guys are getting my attention.","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"
1438,"2017-02-24",3.5,"On Tap Clear deep golden, thin wispy off white head. Light slightly carmelized woody malt flavors. Just enough hop bitters to balance. Very clean finish.A light clean amber.","Boise, Idaho, USA","IndianaRed"
1438,"2016-12-30",3.5,"Bottle thanks to David. Pours a clear copper color with a medium white head. A big sweet fruity nose. The flavor is big sweet toast, grainy, lemons. Very smooth.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
1438,"2016-10-29",3.1,"On tap at St. Augustines, pours a crystal clear copper with a small white head. Aroma is very light, with toasted malt and a touch of German lager yeast. Flavour is along the same lines, with sweet cereal malt, German lager yeast, and straw. Pretty unassuming and lacking in depth, but well-constructed and drinkable. Decent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1438,"2016-09-02",3.7,"Clear brownish Amber. Sweet malts lead the way in flavor and aroma. Has a nice spicy backbone and finish. Some toasted Bready malt, too. Very enjoyable.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
1438,"2016-07-29",3.2,"Near clear red liquid. Easy breezy beautiful summer beer. Not a whole lot of depth or flavor but it is easy and refreshing.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Hungover"
1438,"2016-04-29",3.7,"Can. 2/24/16 canning date. 

A: Mostly opaque brownish red with a large off-white head that quickly lapses into a ring on the outer edges of the glass. Solid lacing. 

N: Malt, toast, earth, and some pine up front. Lots of bread and biscuit. Bit of peppercorn to spritz it up. Grapefruit lurks far underneath but one can discern it. Hint of clove.

T: Balanced between a medium light sweetness and medium light bitterness. 

M: Very prickly carbonation, light body, no alcohol. 

O: Solidly constructed beer. I cant really find much fault with it. Easy to drink and tasty.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
1438,"2016-03-17",2.7,"UPDATED: MAR 22, 2016 Im not that into this beer. Its kinda boring and the taste goes down a lot as it gets less cold. Cute can though.","Ashland, Oregon, USA","Squizzle"

1438,"2015-07-03",3.3,"(Can) Not too bad. Some slight bitterness, some clean, soda-like quality, but not very sweet. Fairly light, but pretty decent.","","smallfry"

1438,"2014-07-09",3.3,"Dark amber for sure. A lot going here. Cloudy. Peppery. Lemony, sure. People say burnt toast, and I agree with them. Nutty. Toffee-y. A big party in my mouth. I have a feeling I don't what's going on here. Is very good. Very different, for me. Not a back to back kinda beer for me, but it's dee-lish! I'm going to say cloudy again. Cloudy in appearance, and it appears I'm also cloudy in judgement.

1438,"2014-06-24",3.8,"On tap at The Victory Bar - Pours clear copper / bronze with an off-white head. The aroma has toasty bread, dry toffee and good smoothness that gives it an authentic feel. It is medium bodied with semi-sharp carbonation. The flavor starts off with mild toast, nice dark bread and some pepper. The finish has lots of dry toasted malt and more of the pepperiness. Really nice.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1438,"2014-05-21",3.6,"Not too well versed in this style but I love trying new ones whenever I can. Rouged-up amber with a head that gets the fuck outta Dodge in a hurry. Poppy carbonation with a refreshing medium feel. Lemony, grainy and nutty bread with a dash of cardamom and cinnamon. A fun one Id drink again, rather session this that dirty ol lagers.","Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, CANADA","BrewGoblin"
1438,"2014-04-20",3.1,"Bright amber. Not much head. Light toasty amber malts. Sweet malt without nuance. A little cracker and a little caramel. Decent...similar to the commercial alts but with a touch more yeast complexity.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1438,"2014-04-19",3.5,"16oz can, thanks Byron. Pours a deep amber color with a white head. Aroma is malty, caramel, a little nutty. Medium on the palate with creamy carbonation. Flavor is sweet, malty, bready, caramel, a light, clean bitterness, with a sweet, caramel finish. Tasty.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"
1438,"2014-03-01",4.0,"Yeah thats right, four. Tall can. Light copper, off-white head. Nose is toasted malt, nutty, spicy/earthy hops. Flavour is pils cereal, toasted malt, PNW earthy hops. Reminds me of Driftwood Crooked Coast... I respect this brewerys PNW twist on German ales as much as I do for Uprights PNW twist on saisons, and think they deserve recognition. If this range of sessionable styles carves out a local niche over the next decade Ill be a very happy manchild.","Phnom Penh, CAMBODIA","WheatKing"
1438,"2014-02-20",3.5,"Poured to glass. Amber hue with off white head that dissipated to single layer. Aroma is caramel malt, honey, cola, esters, cloves, sugars. Taste is sweet throughout with a CO2 sharpness in the finish. Not too cloying. Mouthfeel is fantastic with medium body and good carbonation. Overall, this is a fantastic malt forward Alt....almost like a malty Dopplebock.","Sweet Home, Oregon, USA","Salmoniform"
1438,"2014-01-21",3.4,"Brown pour. Great malt character - somewhat sweet, biscuity, good balance from the hops. Quite nice.","Alberta, CANADA","RumRunner101"
1438,"2014-01-09",3.2,"Beautiful can. Chestnut brown in colour. The nose is caramel heavy with some rich fruit too. It is lighter in texture than the nose suggests but still inthe sweeter side. A good beer but not my style.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Alphadelic"
1438,"2013-12-21",3.6,"Draught at St. Augustines, VancouverAmber color, hazy, with compact head. Nice malts, both the aroma and mostly the flavor, they are a bit biscuity (cookies); dry mouthfeel; quite strong bitterness with modern and American hopping, not really classic, but well made.Nice one.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
1438,"2013-12-21",3.3,"On tap at St Augustines in Vancouver. Crisp and hoppy with decent malts. Not much experience with altbiers, but its quite pleasant.","British Columbia, CANADA","stantheman"
1438,"2013-12-14",4.0,"Pours with some head. Dark and nut brown appearance. Tastes very malty with some hops, but not hoppy enough to overpower the malt. Goes down smooth and easily.","","daveddec"
1438,"2013-12-06",3.4,"Tin. Spice aroma with a bit of spruce. Malty spine with lots of hop, almost too hoppy for an altbier. Still a very pleasant bier with a good finish.","Munchen an der Willamette, Oregon, USA","troopie"

1438,"2013-10-13",3.5,"473ml can from ""Lifesource"" Grocers in Salem.
$2.99 . can is 5.3% alc
Pours a hazelnut ,clear brown colour with a very nice thick,creamy eggshell white head.
Good creamy biscuit malt aromas,slightly nutty with a whiff of grassy hop.
Smooth malty creamy ,nutty flavour, some hop bitterness and a burnt grain after taste.Very nice and as they say a bit hoppier than the usual for style but still within i think!
Nice mouth feel on the thin side and low carbonation helps.
Very nice beer a good change of pace from the usual up here.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
1438,"2013-02-23",3.7,"Draught at Grain & Gristle restaurant in Portland. Good mild, sweet malt aroma, with some spiciness and slight floral notes. Clear dark amber color, really pretty. Bright sweet cereal initial / smooth rich malt mid palate, reminiscent of Bass Pale Ale / light bitternes and then a blanced finish. Thin body. A pleasant alt, just a touch hoppier than a German alt.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
1438,"2011-11-04",2.9,"Taster at the brewery around 60F.  Cant tell about the foam in the little taster glass, but its present.  Lightly astringent aroma, somewhat grassy hop aroma.  Color is a thin brownish grey appropriate to style.  Taste is neither strongly malty nor hoppy.  Body is light to moderate lacking distinct character.  In some regards this is very much like authentic Altbier.  It is lighter than nearly all american craft brew but darker than German lager, it is slightly maltier than said lager but nowhere near as malty as US craft brew.  Difficult beer to appreciate in the US but maybe in Germany it would rate well.","Oregon, USA","benjaminbier"
