2167,"2012-09-13",3.3,"1/9/2011 - New Belgium brewery has never had the boisterous volume of breweries like Stone. Their brewery is amply proud of its mission to be green in its pursuit of brewing, but I hear comparatively little bragging about some of their finest creations - the Lips of Faith series. Thats why the Sahti fits their personality so well. A deep bronze color and mild carbonation with a head quick to evaporate dresses a light, soft, mildly spicy and demure beer. I found honeysuckle and light malt aromas in the nose, and a soft and soothing carbonation pairs nicely with the subtle flavors of all spice and cinnamon. I would enjoy this more if the flavor profile was turned up a little but, but I can also appreciate when a beer chooses to be an off-note in an otherwise loud and complicated song.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Restrained malty sweetness, some rye crispness, slight biscuit taste. Nice round mouthfeel, very dry finish. Heres the thing: I know talk of ""beer styles"" makes the New Belgium brewers skin crawl, and I like that about them. But hey, they called this Sahti, not me, so I feel entitled to quibble. Sahti is an ancient Finnish style using rye as most of the grainbill, mashed with and lautered through a juniper twig bed, not boiled, utilizing little or no hops, fermented with rough bakers yeast, left unfiltered. This beer doesnt appear to use much juniper or rye, is clearly boiled with hops, fermented with a very refined neutral yeast, and microfiltered. Its a great beer, possibly better than most Sahtis, definitely more shelf-stable, but it barely resembles true Sahti. Regardless, you should give it a try.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

2167,"2011-09-07",3.6,"Hazy orange amber under a bright white head that thinned and dissipated in short order. The aromas didnt smack of juniper as I had expected, but were rather subtle and leaned more toward blood oranges. The flavours are the main writing point as it was sweet and tangy with orange citrus flavours. It was a fairly light beer considering its pedigree (and its alcohol content, thought my companion who si a very learned chap in these matters). The hop content was either incredibly subtle or my tastebuds had taken a beating from dinner. Juniper cames through on a subtle note toward the finish as well as being herbal and astringent with lots of ginger. 
This beer was ideally suited to its purpose as a mid-dinner conversation piece. Plenty to muse on and good dollops of flavour to accompany the strength of the Mexican dishes we were eating. A cracking drop.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
2167,"2011-09-06",3.0,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into dimpled mug.

Appearance: Clear amber with thin white head that disappears leaving no lacing. I thought a Sahti should be cloudy?

Aroma: Bready with a decent level of spiciness, citrus and a somewhat metallic bitterness (this may be the juniper).

Taste: Very bready, caramely and spicy, with citrus and juniper. The juniper just seems a little strange to me, as if some gin was poured into my beer. Surprisingly simple, and almost ordinary, compared to my expectations.

Palate: Moderate carbonation, medium body with a juniper-driven dry finish. Strangely boozy for the moderate alcohol.

Overall: Hard to review a style I have not had before. It is hard to know if it is indicative of the style or not. My guess is not, since I thought it would be much more yeasty, both in appearance (cloudy) and in taste (banana, maybe slightly tart). As is, this seems to be simple English Ale with a bunch of juniper. I will need to try one of the better reviewed examples of the style to know if I am the problem or if the beer is (I have a sneaking suspicion it is the beer).","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

Bit heavy-handed with the caramel on the nose, almost like a candy bar melting in the sun. The juniper and rye just emphasize the sweetness of all the residual sugars in this. Creamy medium body with prickly carb, though not much of it. That gin flavor juniper, along with the spiciness of the rye, kick up a little on the mid palate, flowing under the river of malty caramel notes. You can almost feel the angry little imprisoned sugar molecules trapped in this beer, slashing rebelliously against your mouthflesh on their way to their doom, its just sharp and prickly and coruscating.

2167,"2011-05-22",3.3,"22 ounce bomber.  Ive seen this several times but never picked one up, until last night.  Im not really sure what to expect out of this beer.  The label states its a Finnish Rye and that its got some hops in it.  Little to no head, cloudy appearance, murky carbonation.  Color is a nice amber brown, cinnamon.  Aroma isnt as big as I had hoped for  guess those hops arent used for aroma.  I can pick out the rye and some caramel malt sweetness.  Pretty disappointing really.  Luckily the beer makes up for it in the taste department, as theres lots of things going on.  The spice of the rye really hits you first, it kind of punches you in the mouth and makes you sit up and take notice.  Unfortunately, from there things sort of wash out in the middle, as the mouth is still reeling from the initial hit of rye.  However the beer makes a comeback, finishing with floral juniper and citrusy hop bitterness.  This is clearly and almost makes up for the lack of complexity in the middle.  Mouthfeel is sufficiently slick though never oily, with medium carbonation.  Its somewhat watery  I find myself wanting the body of the beer to be a little bit heartier.  Theres a little bit of a hint of alcohol esters in the middle of the beer but nothing outlandish  and Im relatively sensitive to those so you may not even notice.  Overall this is an interesting though slightly disappointing beer.",", Missouri, USA","VengefulOdin"
2167,"2011-04-21",2.2,"Picked this up at the Liquor Stop in Indiana. Shared at a recent tasting and poured into a tulip.

Really not a good example of a Sahti. Oh well, here goes. The beer pours a moderate golden color with a thin white head with moderate retention. The nose brings forward a bit of bready malt. Really plain. Plain, plain, plain. How does that happen with a sahti? Normally Im complaining that theres way too much going on. The taste is along the same lines. A bit of mild weirdness from who knows what in the background, but mostly just a bit of lightly-sweet malt. Feel is medium and average. Decent carbonation. Nothing horribly offensive about this beer, its just a bad example of the style. It just doesnt really present anything that would make me think this was a sahti.

Good effort, but there are way better Lips of Faith beers.","Murderapolis, Minnesota, USA","mtjoseph"

Sahtis are one of those styles that set the great brewers apart from the rest. It takes a delicate touch to make a beer that has some character but isnt a slap in the face. Of the few I have tried this one is not my favorite. However it does meet all the criteria of a solid beer - a reasonable price point, some unique qualities, and a range of flavors to please most palates. I am already looking forward to my next bottle in the Lips of Faith series.

Aroma / Appearance - Lively carbonation is evident through the light bronze body. Looking like a sparkling wine it seems as if the bubbles are desperate to escape. Spiced herbal tea is light and airy with a good balance of hops. Red berries and hints of fig give this a nice seasonal air.

Flavor / Palate - Full bodied and robust the mouthfeel is thicker than I expected. A mix of floral and woody hops it glides carelessly down the throat. Mellowing out within seconds it manages to still leave a calling card of fig and roses. A distinct change of pace from your run of the mill IPAs, stouts, and pale ales this was a bold experiment that succeeded. Hopefully other breweries and brewpubs will give the style a shot in the future.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
2167,"2011-02-24",3.3,"Bomber.  Pours orange hazy hue... not much foam.  Aroma is barnyard funk, fruit (peaches?) and some faint spice...  Taste is refreshing, or maybe Im just THAT thirsty.  Starts out spicy and tangy, then turns more bitter as the grapefruit peel taste sneaks in, before a final turn toward pepper finishes things off.  ABV well-disguised enough.  Big issue here is that the beer is nothing all that original.  Its a decent seasonal.  Nothing more.","San Diego, California, USA","gorditoabd"
2167,"2011-02-10",2.6,"22 ounce bottle - $5.49 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours out a clear, amber-hued body with a two finger-high, whitish head.

Smell: Sweetish, grainy nose, smelling of malted barley with a hints of spicy rye, golden syrup, peppery alcohol, and juniper-scented soap.

Taste: Toasted barley and a zip of rye with a caramel-like sweetness and hint of crushed sugar cookies. Slight hint of juniper berries. Light kiss of citrus. Somewhat soapy character midway, picking up warming alcohol nearing the end. Dry finish with a bit of displeasing medicinal twang to it.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: A letdown, really. The loosely medicinal, booziness of the brew, along with its ho-hum flavor, leaves me a bit flat.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Virtually no smokiness or juniper berries present.  Definitely not what I have experienced with previous sahtis.  Seems more like a Belgian ale.  Transparent orange body with a small, quickly dissipating whitish head.  Starts a little sweet, before this becomes chewier, and stickier in the middle with some yeasty ester flavors.  Good deal of banana is there.  Finishes lightly herbal and lightly bitter.  This lacks many of the traditional aspects of a real sahti.  Disappointing.

2167,"2011-01-14",3.1,"Bomber.  Nose is vaguely sweet malt, has a juniper and spruce aroma that reminds more of perfume than anything woodsy.  Intense and room-filling (not on HOTD levels, though).  Pretty clear amber pour with a short beige head.  Am I deceived, or do I detect some significant hop bite?  A little rushing, gritty graininess over the occasionally syrupy malt, which itself settles down to be somewhat flat.  Juniper comes through more, and its distinctly on the berry side.  Bit of a toothpaste experience, the flavors leading in the direction of cool, soothing mint are pleasing enough but then theres that gritty cleansing aspect.  Deft touches of flowers and honey, with faint peppery smack.  Some lesser caramel and stale air, mild vanilla and some genuinely interesting malt depth, spice is toned down but still atop the earth.

Not having a terrific amount of experience with Sahtis, nor much confidence in the Lips of Faith series beyond a few exceptional beers, I was really unsure of what to expect here. First thing I noticed on the dingy brown pour were underwhelming carbonation and a thinnish look to the beer. Seems like some consistency issues, as other rates have noted a lively body. Spice in the nose is sharp but indistinct. To what tradition does this beer belong? Body is indeed thin, with only faint prickles detectable. Spice profile seems on auto-pilot, with weird mix of juniper, caramel malt, dried fruit, and light acidity. I have no idea what the goals were in brewing this beer, nor - shudder - if they were achieved. I found it a train wreck.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

2167,"2010-10-20",3.4,"The pour is a sparkling clear, orange color with a white, frothy, average head which does leave a thin layer of froth and tight, frothy lace.  The nose is certainly spicy with rye bread, pepper, allspice, rustic twig notes, and a bit of citrus peel.  The flavor is similar with more sweet notes emerging, some cookie, cinnamon and nutmeg, similar rustic twig notes, pink grapefruit peel, and honeyed rye bread notes.  The palate is nice with a nearly full body, soft to lively carbonation, and a creamy/round mouthfeel.  The finish is fairly short for the ABV, quite bready, and still spicy with pepper and cinnamon.  This is a pleasant beer with some of the characteristics of the more traditional sahtis, but lacked in a few major areas; the Belgian yeast notes and phenols were not there to add to the spicy nature and the juniper notes were quite subtle.  Not that I am any expert on the style, but this seemed like a fairly bland, American attempt at a very unique beer.

2167,"2010-10-15",3.2,"A solid pour into my produces a two-finger thick, pale, off-white colored head in my 25cl tulip glass.  The beer is a light amber hue that shows an almost brilliantly clear, bright copper / red color when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of cascade hops, ample biscuit like malt character, some spicy grain notes, lots of grapefruit, some lychee like aromas and some light juicy fruit gum like notes.  I dont really notice the juniper, but I think that it is mixing in with the fruity hop notes and does seem to add a touch of spicy berry character to the more dominant fruit character.  This smells like a nice hoppy ale, but I was hoping for more of the Sahti character coming through; other than this disappointment though this is quite a nice smelling beer.

Somewhat lighter than I was expecting and the beer has a cleaness that I associate with a bit too aggressive filtration process.  Flavors of tangerine, lychee and ruby-red grapefruit are balanced by an almost turpene like spiciness towards the finish that seems to be from the juniper.  This beer is fairly sweet, actually perhaps a bit too sweet in that it could use more hops or spice character to balance the sweetness.  The body definitely has a fullness to it that keeps this from being quaffable.  There is some nice backing malt character here that has a touch of spiciness to it, some toasty whole grain like notes, lots of lingering biscuit like character, and some caramelized-honey like malt sweetness.

Interesting perhaps, but not with the Sahti character that I was hoping for.  I cant help but feel a bit disappointed as the hops seem to dominate this beer.  I cant even just fully enjoy this as a hoppy beer as it comes off as being overly filtered and lacking in malt / hop complexity because of it.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
