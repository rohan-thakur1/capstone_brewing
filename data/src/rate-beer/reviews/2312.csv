2312,"2017-04-29",3.4,"I carefully pour this gloppy dark brown beverage and a two finger cappuccino coloured head rises up; interestingly the head around the perimeter is foamy but in the centre it's a fluffy fine fizz. The head size slowly shrinks but the fizz continues.

Bouquet is slightly muted but boozy (9% ABV) some yeastiness and fruity promise - dark fruits hints of raisins, plums and distant cloves. 

The mouthfeel is syrupy smooth almost chewy; but the sapor is somewhat surprisingly subdued - the mellow ripe fruity flavours give just enough sweetness but this is finely balanced by the yeast and cloves. 

Whilst it's flavour is not overwhelming it has such a warming charm, winsome character and a wholehearted constitution that you just want to sink back into a comfortable leather chair, listen to a Chopin nocturne and savour its gentle delights.","Nottinghamshire, ENGLAND","Onesimus"

Si la bière a donc le label bière trappiste authentique, difficile toutefois de croire que les moines de labbaye de Chimay ne sont pas un tantinet perdu dans les affres du marketing. Lauthenticité nest plus tout à fait présente. Masi revenons à notre bière! Sa robe est dun brun profond et surmontée dune splendide mousse blanc-cassé d1,5 cm dépaisseur environ. Le nez est souple, légèrement sur la réserve, avec des notes de céréales, de coriandre et une touche de café torréfié. La première attaque est de suite dune très belle intensité, toujours sur les céréales et le caramel. Lutilisation de froment en complément de lorge permet de complexifier les arômes. La 2ème bouche laisse sexprimer lamertume, belle et intense. sur des notes de café, dépices et dorange. Léquilibre est parfait. Lintensité de lamertume va crescendo pour laisser un final intense laissant saffirmer davantage lalcool. Lensemble reste néanmoins soyeux et mesuré. Ceci est dailleurs à la fois la raison du succès de la Chimay Grande Réserve succès mais également sa limite. Les arômes gagneraient à être légèrement plus affirmés pour que la bière atteigne la perfection.","FRANCE","jybi"

2312,"2016-07-15",3.7,"Bottle. 2014 tasted yesterday (14/Jul/2016) 
Aroma: Caramel, raisins, dried fruit. Very delicate aromas, nothing strong. Being used to the strong new-wave scents I miss them here. Alcohol pretty much covered but you can feel it is there.
Appearance: Hazy dark brown with redish reflexes. Minimal off-white head that does not last more than a couple of seconds.
Taste: Traces of caramel in a malty sweetness and a bitterness that comes from the alcohol that is not hidden but rather ballanced. For my taste the alcohol is a bit too much prominent.
Palate: Medium carbonation gives that sticky feeling. 
Overall: Seeing the score and how everybody goes crazy for this beer I am not that impressed. Judging by this bottle Id say it is overhyped, and the brand makes a lot of the score.

2312,"2015-10-20",3.9,"2015 bottle, room temp, poured into a stange glass all the way in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Found a small liquor store that carries it for $3.50/bottle. Amazing. This particular bottle is aggressively carbonated, crackling like a glass of soda for several minutes after pouring. The head was light tan and fizzed up quickly before rapidly dissipating. Like the carbonation, the appearance also reflects a glass of coke: brown and opaque. Lots on the nose. Sweet up front with some caramel and candy sugar, then a strong fruity aroma with plums, raisins, and maybe a floral undertone. Body is full and creamy with an unsurprising carbonated sharpness and a dry finish. Taste doesnt carry as much sweetness as a nose and has a strong lingering bitterness throughout. The fruity notes remain with some smoke, leather, and woodiness. Boozy finish leaves alcohol on the tongue. I dont think this is the best bottle of Chimay Blue Ive had, and Ill definitely update this rating next time I get the chance, but its delicious nevertheless.

There are aromas of raisin, almond paste, it reminds me of moms apple pie, only cinnamon is missing, and apple of course. The smell is dark, and deep, brown, very sweet and slightly bitter. There is some alcohol sweetness. Smell it and you know what I mean, words are. It enough to describe the smell and rich aromas of this beer. The taste the taste contains a lot of the smell.

Lots of chocolate and some coffee on the nose. Very porter-like aroma initially. Much less sherry-like than the 2006 from a 330 ml bottle I drank in 2014. Still some wineous notes but more like a fine port than bad sherry. The palate is slightly less impressive than the nose. Medium bodied with some winey and malty notes. Medium-short finish. Lacks some acidity, bitterness or something to keep it interesting.

2312,"2015-01-16",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2016 33 cl. bottle 2014 vintage at home. The blue Chimay is a really good beer. No doubt about that. Tasty, a hint of yeast, but not too much and a long, rich aftertaste of roastd malt. Yet I was somewhat disappointed. Blue Chimay does not hold up to a comparison with a young Rochefort 10 and not at all to an aged Westvleteren 12 - though the last comparison is unfair - the latest two trappistes I have enjoyed. Yes, it is more drinkable, yes it has a very nice head (too much?) and aroma, but it is so much less complex and almost watery in texture compared with its peers. The most accessible trappiste perhaps, - the beginners entry into the world of trappistes? - good yes, better than most beers as available in all of Europe? Yes. But great...not at this age. However, having shared a Grande Reserve from 2001 with James this Christmas, I was amazed how much life was still left in a 14 year old Chimay. It stil had a little head and surprised with a sherry like taste with clear hoppy notes also still present. I have no doubt it was past its prime, but it was not only interesting, it was also drinkable and good. I still have a 2003 cellared...must try it soon.","DENMARK","tbonde"

2312,"2014-12-31",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2015 Exceptional beer.  Appearance is very bold, and excellent lacing and frothiness which i like.

Taste however is remarkable start to finish with a good mix of dark fruit, nuts, maybe dark chocolate and malt.

UPDATE:  i purchased a 2010 bottle today instead of 2014.  Wow,  even better!!  Especially the aroma,  very lively with a distinct sweetness and very strong malty bread flavor coming through which is anazingly complete.  Also i drank it warmer-  definetly best around 10 or even 12c.","","Cluniac"

2312,"2014-12-30",3.5,"12 oz bottle poured into a Chimay goblet, natch.

A: Pours a murky dark brown color with great opacity. The head is about two fingers high, with an off-white shade. Typical of the style, its very airy in texture and a bit rough-looking, and its retention is decent without being spectacular. No much lacing to speak of.

S: At first, the aroma is mostly bready and peppery, lacking in both fruit esters and even darker malts. There are also touches of earth here and there. To get the most out of this beers nose, you really have to let it warm up - this way, it will develop some nice tones of caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, cherries, and raisins. While the aroma develops into something quite good, not once does it jump out at me; its rather mild to a fault.

T: There is a good amount of raisin flavor as soon as this hits the palate. Past the swallow, it transitions into a sweet caramel-and-chocolate flavor to go with its earthy (but not funky) yeast. There seems to be something ever-so-slightly off about this one, especially on the back end - I want to say its kind of metallic? Yeah, thats it. Metallic. Some stank-ass cheese flavor also pops up in spurts, but I dont consider that a flaw. The complexity here is quite good.

M: The carbonation is quite intense. This makes it light-feeling and a bit prickly, but also very drinkable. Once the fizz calms down, it still remains very dry on the back end. The feel does a good job of reminding me why I enjoy my Belgian-style ales to come from Belgium itself: the carbonation doesnt try to cover up an overly sweet finish, while still retaining a complex nature.

O: Almost great, but that metallic strangeness kind of hurts. This and the mellow aroma keep it out of the fabled 4 range, sadly. I imagine this would go great with a stank-ass cheese (preferably from Chimay themselves), and this is certainly worth having again to find out. Still, my favorite (non-quad) BSDA remains Gouden Carolus Classic.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

I get something new with every sniff: pungent Belgian yeast, prunes/raisins, banana, lots of spice, hazelnuts, dark caramel/toffee, a hint of something floral. Taste is a slightly sweet malt with caramel and hazelnuts, ripe banana. The booze is virtually invisible until the finish, where it starts to give off this pleasant, lingering warmth. This is remarkably drinkable for 9%, and while its not dry per se its remarkably well-balanced. And I just downed it in ten minutes, on an empty stomach, so there goes my night.

2312,"2014-10-04",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 19, 2014 Eine Wiederbegegnung mit dem Starkbier-Klassiker. Ich erinnere mich noch gut, mit welcher Begeisterung ich vor rund 25 Jahren meine ersten Flaschen dieses Bieres (von P&M in Bad Godesberg) verkostet habe. Damals glaubte ich, einen wahren Göttertrunk genießen zu dürfen ... Später sah ich es nüchterner: Rohrzucker und eine blockhaft-eindimensionale Würze ohne Finessen. Recht simpel gestricktes Bier, notierte ich zuletzt. Immer wieder war auch zu lesen, Chimay sei nicht mehr dasselbe Bier wie früher und entfalte sein volles Potential erst nach mehrjähriger Lagerung. Das wollte ich doch mal ausprobieren. - Flasche (75 cl), Jahrgang 2011, drei Jahre im Keller gelagert. - Mahagonifarben, sahniger beigefarbener Schaum. - In der Nase schweres dunkles Malz, Pflaume, zart säuerliche Note, Portwein (oder Rumtopf?). - Antrunk schwer dunkelmalzig mit brotigen Röstaromen (Melanoidine), Rum, Pflaumenmus, Gewürzbrot (Spekulatius). Dabei doch leichtfüßig und sogar spritzig. Gut rezent, weich im Mund. Im Abgang krautig-herber Hopfen mit schwach holziger Herbe. Nicht allzu bitterer, aber komplex würzig-herber Nachtrunk. - Gut komponiertes, in Würde gealtertes Starkbier, füllig aber nicht plump, mit Anklängen von Weihnachtsgewürzen, dabei fast schlank (darf ich sagen: dünn?). Durchaus ein schönes Bier, eins der besseren Starkbiere. Aber 100 Punkte scheinen mir doch etwas übertrieben. Inzwischen gibt es weit bessere Biere dieser Art in Belgien.","Beijing, CHINA","Moravius"

Mørk mahognifarvet og ufiltreret ""stærk belgier""/belgisk Ale med kæmpehøj 6-7 cm tyk offwhite skumkrone, ""storboblende"". Et ikke specielt kønt skumlandskab, efter toppen er svundet ind.
Aroma af kaffe, chokolade, gær, tørret frugt og bondegård. 
Ganske kraftig og fyldig smag af tobak, alkohol og chokolade. Spændende symbiose mellem sødme og det bitre. Solid bitterhed, medium sødme, zero sur. 
Kraftfuld krop og ganske vel-karboneret. Cremet til sticky konsistens og meget perlende. 
Chimay Bleu udvikler sig efter åbning, og sødmen får mere plads henover afklimatisering. 
Denne øl var for en årrække siden min egentlige første specialøl, og det kan undre, at der skulle rate's små 450 øl før den. Smagen holder, som dengang, men karboneringen kunne IMO sagtens være neddroslet. Trods dén observation, er dette bryg en klassiker!","Valby, DENMARK","PapaVillum"

2312,"2014-09-21",3.6,"Comparison between 2014 and 2006 bottles from Systembolaget (numeric rating based on current 2014 beer). Pours dirty dark brown in the glass - the 2014 with a beige head that stays throughout the session - the 2006 totally without head. Appearance: 5/3. Aroma of 2014 is very discrete, some roasted notes, thats all. The 2006 has a more powerful aroma, mainly of yeast - not too attractive. Aroma: 5/5. The taste of the 2014 is fresh, full of roasted notes, some spices like licorice, and a little bitterness in the aftertaste. The 2006 has obviously lost its freshness but the licorice and fennel spices are there, also the yeast comes through, but hardly any bitterness. Taste: 7/4. On the palate the 2014 wins easily, being fresh and lively. The 2006 is smooth but dull. Palate: 5/2. Overall: 14/9. The 2006 is sold as a special case at Systembolaget, probably some boxes that were misplaced and found 8 years later and now sold at premium price: 5.2 euros a bottle. Its a beer well over its prime and not worth the price. The normal fresh Chimay displayes the qualities that made this the most popular trappist beer in the world, with its herbal fruity freshness.

2312,"2014-09-06",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2016 The big blue Chimay, their most notorious product. Yellowish beige, sticky head, medium thick, decreasing and opening but leaving islands of foam and a steady rim around the glass with pretty lacing; colour deep mahogany with wine-red hue, notably darker than Chimay Rouge but still transparent, clear but hazy after adding the deposit. Rich aroma - though less strong and more restrained than in its Rochefort or Westvleteren counterparts - consisting of fondant chocolate, candied dates, pears, port wine, brown candi sugar, some faint but nice wheaty sourishness, orange peel, marzipan, gingerbread, dry spices such as coriander, cinnamon, cloves or aniseed, brown bread, banana, aromatic brown rhum especially as the beer warms up, red wine. Taste of candied fruits (figs and dates), some dried banana, smooth and rich, deep dark caramel and chocolate maltiness, medium but somewhat sourish carbonation, something wheaty, clean yeastiness with lively spicy notes dancing on the tongue, dryish, bit starch-like and powdery, finish with drying carbonation, some elegant floral and herbal hops and booze, in the form of brandy-like, warming, long and dry alcohol, managing to stay just subtle enough to avoid becoming wry. Though often considered less authentic and too industrial compared with the smaller Belgian trappist brands, this is still a very big beer, which becomes all the more clear in the Grande Réserve version on 75 cl: this is one of Belgiums best provisional beers, with an amazing ageing capacity. I have bottles from different vintages in the cellar and am patiently waiting to open the first one reaching five years of age; earlier tastings of old Grande Reserves will stick with me forever, as they undergo a maderisation leading to an immensely complex ale, almost like old port wine. I have taken this into account while rating this - since there is no separate entry for Chimay Grande Réserve (as it is indeed simply the blue on 75 cl bottles). The true great trappist beers are a joy forever and a beacon of good taste in the Belgian beer landscape.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2312,"2014-06-09",4.6,"Transferred from BA review on 4-14-12 

Poured from 750 ml bottle into snifter 

Appearance  Pours a deep hazy brown color with hints of mahogany seen when held to the light. Upon pouring a one finger tan head is formed. The head fades with some swiftness to leave a nice amount lacing.

Smell  Dark fruits are heavy in the nose with nice prune, cherry, and raisin aromas. There is a yeasty, spicy, and malty aroma as well which meld nicely with the sweeter dark fruit aromas.

Taste- The taste starts out with a nice mix of dark bready malts and darker fruit flavors. These two tastes provide a very solid foundation with which the rest of the taste experience evolves from. More towards the middle the yeasty flavors detected in the nose come into fruition with some spice flavors coming into play as well. Toward the very end of the taste a lighter alcohol flavor develops along with a molasses flavor which when mixed with the bready malt and dark fruits leaves a rather satisfying aftertaste on the tongue.

Mouthfeel  The body is creamy and smooth. It coasts the tongue allowing all the flavors to really sit on the tongue to be experienced. The carbonation is on the medium side adding some tingling excitement on the tongue, but not too high to take away from the creaminess of the body. 

Overall  A fantastic abbey beer. Its renowned and a classic for a reason.","","Darkmagus82"

2312,"2014-03-28",4.0,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance had a dark brown colored body with a massive three finger white head. The head must last for about a good four minutes before it died. Minimal spider web lacing speckled the sides and slid fairly quickly down the sides of the glass.
The smell had raisins and cherries with light pears and caramels in the background, slightly in a bready sort of way. The yeast is very subdued, but its there.
The taste takes all of the previously mentioned flavors and combined altogether in a sweet bready yet somewhat earthy sort of way.
The palate sat about a medium with nothing remotely close to having any sort of harshness on the tongue. As many times as Ive had this, this is probably the smoothest most Belgian beer on the market. It leaves a sweet sticky aftertaste and a slightly dry finish. Though at 9%, Id still say fairly sessionable.
Overall, this is a Belgian I like, probably because the yeast is tamed well. Nice dessert and night cap!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

2312,"2014-02-05",3.6,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2014 11.2 oz bottle poured into a goblet. Immediately after pouring, theres a strong, aggressive yeasty and mildew aroma, but it fades quickly into a combinations that strong green grape and alcohol (reminds me a bit of a chardonnay). Some apple and peach undertones peak through as well as a very faint hint of banana. As the head recedes, the aroma of warm buttered (maybe even honeyed?) biscuits becomes prevalent. Its a murky, raisin colored beer with a light, off-white, fizzy head that has splotchy retention (a bit wells up on the sides, with a light collection smack dab in the middle). Its balanced well, about medium all around with regards to sweet, sour, and bitter - maybe a bit less on the sour. On the palate, the alcohol is present and noticeable, but theres also a pleasant toasted and astringent balance to keep the alcohol from dominating. Its a full and fatty body beer that finds a texture somewhere between oily and creamy. Theres a lot of carbonation, but its fairly dull - it comes out if you swish it; almost to the point of filling your mouth further. It finishes with a complex, non-offensive combination of floral, spicy (honey & clove come to mind), and alcohol which leaves a heavy coating on the mouth for the aftertaste which, after some time, manifests as an umami taste.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Still a pretty damn decent beer after all these years though and really widely available, so thats nice.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

A: Foaming upon decapping, this beer always foams over. Its a deep, muddy mahogany color with little/no transluscency. Light brown, 1-2 finger whipped creamy cap on this one.

S: Sweet, light molasses, hin of sour apple and pear from yeast. Dates, figs. 

T: Sweetened Ruby port flavor up front is accented by tones of maple, walnut, fresh pecan, brown sugar. Imagine these traits to develop with time in bottle.

M: Medium-full body with light carbonation allows you to really chew on this sticky monster. Every flavor is revealed as the carbonation is subtle enough to help move along flavor, not overbear it.

D: Drinkability: my ability to drink this is high. This is a goddam delicious brew and I plan to purchase a 750ml as they have the bottle date on cork and then lay it down for a couple years. Of the other Chimays, this stands out for me.

Pours a slightly hazy very dark ruby brown with a frothy two finger tan head. The head sticks around for a very long time leaving huge globs of lacing once it finally does fade.

Aroma is chock full of grapes and plums along with licorice. A whiff of alcohol along with some spicy yeast notes. Some woody notes in there as well. The aroma doesnt smack me in the face like i was hoping but it is very nice and complex.

The flavor is really heavy on sweet molassas, toffee, dark grapes and plums. Some wood and a fairly hefty dose of alcohol. Thankfully the sweetness tends to fade and does not dominate the taste and mouthfeel. More alcohol is detectable while cold but as the beer warms, more complexities begin to emerge with the wood and dark fruits. Silky smooth and slightly sticky mouthfeel but the sweetness is restrained.

Some boozy bitterness to finish with a mildly fruity aftertaste. A very good beer but not all that it was cracked up to be. To be sure, I've enjoyed other Belgians more.

2312,"2013-08-08",3.6,"As a real lover of dark Belgian beers (and generally more towards the quad end) I've always felt this fell a bit short, but upon finding a 3 year old bottle, I felt it was worth another shot. An impressive nose, that beautiful, signature dark fruit, but the alcohol is definitely there too. A lot more sweetness in the taste than in many of my favourites, caramel and spice on top of the expected cherry, plum, fig... Light and smooth mouth, but with a fair bit of fizz too (in my 3 year old bottle). Would recommend at this age and would be keen to try at 5 years and above too. Nice lacing. My money is still on the Abbaye de Rocs, Westvleteren 8 and Rochefort 8, which all carry a unique character that beats the anticipated 'all-roundedness' of Chimay. Still, it's far more readily available than the above and often the best beer available in many bottle shops.

2312,"2013-06-14",4.6,"I poured a 750ml bottle (dated 4/10) into the official Chimay chalice.

Appearance: Deep shade of burgundy/brown proper. Forms a small, dark beige, soapy head which eventually dissipates and doesnt lace the glass.

Smell: A veritable cornucopia of fruits, some spice, and confectionery sweetness.

Taste: When I first reviewed Chimay Blue in December of 2009 I liked it, but thought it was too intense and a bit overrated. Ive had a lot of experience with beer over the last three and a half years and was eager to try this vintage bottle from my cellar collection. Its amazing how my perspective on it has changed and also how well the beer itself has improved. 

What was intense and spastic is now smooth and refined, yet still plenty complex and robust. I think this palette is inherently drinker-friendly, it just needs some time to ensure a smoother delivery. I cant imagine not being amazed by these flavors. Sweet caramel and toffee flavors at the beginning with slight bitterness through the middle and a delicious rush of dark fruits to the finish line: plum, cherry, fig, raisin, red grape, etc. There is still a hint of alcohol which adds a subtle warmth and ties the flavors together like a Oriental rug to a living room. This is by far the best of the Belgian quads I have ever had and makes me appreciate the style much more now that Ive experienced a true vintage.

Drinkability: Ill admit that Chimay Blue and most of the bottle-conditioned Trappist beers are pretty intense when theyre fresh. After three years in the bottle, the carbonation has settled nicely. The mouthfeel is calm, on the thicker side, but not sticky or cloying. It goes down quite smoothly, though I was still getting some CO2 stuck in my throat even after all this time. The 9% ABV hasnt completely disappeared as theres a faint warmness, but it works well with the delivery this time. I was able to drink the entire 750ml bottle myself without any struggle.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

2312,"2013-06-12",4.3,"There is no perfect beer or ale! But this one is close. A true gift of God made by his servants. Bought a 750ml for about $15. Worth every penny. The Blue is a real treat. Better to leave in the glass a few minutes and let it start to warm a bit to release all of its potential and some of the CO2. Smooth as silk and full mouth feel with a hint of the strong alcohol content. Add this one to your bucket list.

Rationale: I was new to the style back then. With experience I want to revisit one of my favorite, and see if I like it as much as I was then. So here goes!

330 ml bottle bought at CitySuper in Harbour City, Tsim Sha Tsui.
Looks: Cloudy hazy amber brown colour with a layer of yeast sediments; One and a quarter finger head with creamy, lasting light beige foam; Excellent sticky lacing with fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant rich dark malt, with strong plum, raisins, figs, light Brandy, nice alcohol, vanilla, strong caramel, strong toffee, whipped cream, candi sugar, sweet bread, strong Bel yeast and light grass. Lovely!

Taste: Mid to strong sweet full dark malt, with strong plums figs, metallic, smart alcohol, light liquorices, caramel, toffee, molasses, strong spices, earth, biscuits, strong Bel yeast, lime, herbs, fairly strong bitter hops and grass.

Body: Full body. Dry, slick and creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Rich dark malt in a very smooth and solid background. Creamy and very Bock-ish. Then very strong plums and figs hit hard and fast followed by well-attenuated dry alcohol and liquorices and you know right away this is classy! Layered caramel and toffee with perfect medium sweetness. Most of it went to the booze, the rest is nice dryness. Spicy, slightly earthy and quite biscuit Bel yeast, round with pretty strong lime and herbs. Close to perfect!

Booze: I couldnt handle the 9% abv back then and got KO-ed fast with a rush. Now the booze tasted dry, tasty and quite restrained and I appreciated it even more!

Hoppiness: Light grass in nose. Lime, herbs and grass in taste; Bitterness is fairly strong for a lasting, mid to high astringent bitter-sweet fruity malt finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Creamy, fruity and nice herbal bitter to mouth.

Comments: Looking back, I think my original rating is just about right, but with a new appreciation with a bit more tasting experience today: Bold but subtle aroma and taste manifested with lots of plums, darks fruits, Bock-ish maltyness. Backed by perfectly-exceuted dry booze with subtle liquorices, and limey herbal hoppiness. All these niceties at the most affordable price you can have as Chimay being the most widely distributed Trappist beers in the city. Everything seems to works in its flavor and it earns it. Brilliant!

-------- />(riginally rrated  on 6 February 2013):

Cloudy dark ale brown colour; Very good head and frothy, though not as big as like Chimay White; Fine smell of caramel, vanilla, yeast, malt and some flowery fragrance; hops taste is minimal. It is very smooth to mouth with full body, creamy texture, with lingering taste of sweet toffee; lacing is not as apparent as Chimay White; Palate is subtle, lively, organically smooth throughtout with sweet after taste. At abv 9%, its really strong, with the rush come after 5-7 minutes but its gradual and you wont get a bad trip, lovely feeling really. :)

Comment: The best from Chimay, like everyone who have high regard with it, I love it for being the most subtle Chimay beers among the tri-colors; Lucky enough I bought a brunch of Chimay Blues at bargain price (looks like the people at the supermarket doesnt know how good this is!) so Ill have a great holiday treasuring them. Definitely one of the best Trappist beer in the World. Period.

Topped with a small, off-white head of, as for its size, surprising retention lasting till the very end. Complex aroma, mostly sweet composed of fruity scents, dark forest fruits to be specific, which I would ascribe to yeasts. Taste is also fruity, very consummate and basically resembles Chimay Red, however it brings out some small malty notes, nutty to an extent. Body is medium, texture creamy and carbonation average but as with the red version it swiftly subsides. Finish is medium as well, pretty much follows the taste but accentuates these nice sweet notes, introduces a plethora of different notes, very elaborate. Overall this is a marvelous beer, something to be drunk at every occasion and even bought in advance for time to come.

 Dunkelbraunes, ziemlich trübes Trappistenbier mit sehr schnell verflogenem Schaum. Im Geruch ziemlich hefig, einem Weizenbock ähnlich. Der Geschmack ist hefig-säuerlich und ganz leicht fruchtig. Der Alkoholgehalt schlägt ziemlich durch und betäubt den Gaumen. Die ganze Aromenvielfalt, die ein Trappist üblicherweise zu bieten hat, wird durch den Alkohol quasi erschlagen. Hinzu kommt, dass es nicht ausreichend gelagert worden ist (MHD 2014!). B-Probe erfolgt daher später...

2312,"2012-08-08",4.3,"A Trappist classic--finally time for the review. Ive been drinking this beer periodically for years, from the time I saw it in stores and thought it was French. At hotel in Leuven, so I dont have a proper glass, but this still pours well into a small, clear, plastic cup. Rich, smooth, uniform, big-bubble head. Beer is reddish brown. Combined flavor/palate effect is pretty spicy--probably stemming from the alcohol and the high carbonation level. Has some of the standard Belgian dark aromas and flavors--lots of fruit and funk. The thing with Chimay Blue is that its so balanced--after visiting a lot of other Belgian beers (including every Trappist), its almost simple--but perfectly simple. Really delicate and effervescent. Kind of expands and fills your mouth--the palate is a great feature of this beer. Like other Belgian beers, this is a standard-setter.

Lingering lip-licking complexity.  One of the greatest beers to ever grace mankind.  DECEMBER RE-RATE: As I have branched out more, I see more flaws with beers I once thought were Teh Ultimate, and this includes the beloved Chimay, so I must downrate a little.

Doughy aroma features banana bread, brownie, oatmeal raisin cookie, caramel, and peach scents with a bit of lemon. Pours a ruby-tinted opaque, cloudy, medium brown with a moderate amount of short-lasting beige head. Produces some short-lasting, sporadic lacing. The liquid is appealing, but the head and lacing dont impress. Sweet, malty taste matches the aroma. Toffee, brown sugar, and milk chocolate flavors. Complex and classy taste.

2312,"2012-05-09",3.8,"From BA: 2nd October 2007: The night of the Chimay in my front room. All three beers to be drank in one session. Red, White and Blue, the colours of the Union Jack .

This blue labelled 33cl bottle with its best before date of 2012 was taken with a whole round of Chimay cheese, also with the blue label. Both bought in Belgium on a resent visit.

Poured into my Forbidden Fruit chalice glass, it looked fine, I ensured the whole bottle including the sediment got into the glass.

Dark and a little cloudy, because of my pouring, the off white head didnt hang around, pity.

Although some BAs can smell the scent of a randy fox from half a mile, I struggle to smell my own farts sometimes, so it is not suprising that all I can smell is burnt malts and plums in this fine beer.

The taste however is easier to detect, a good blend of malt and plum fruits are there for all to find, this is a flavoursome beer and the 9% alcohol doesnt kill the intermix of quality products this beer is obviuosly made from, allowing them to infuse without ruining them.

On titre ici à 9 % abv, mais on est bien plus chaud dans le coeur..
Il faut dire que cette bière a toujours attiré le respect et ladmiration des
personnes qui la connaissent, et lextraordinaire joie et allégresse de
ceux qui la découvrent.
Les céréales sont lorge bien sûr mais aussi le froment.
Couleur marron foncé avec une belle mousse beige, juste ce quil faut
pour napper ce breuvage divin.
Volume extrêmement soyeux. 
Arômes superbes de marron, châtaigne et une pointe de chêne.
1er goût de terre brûlée et marrons grillés, à la fois très fin et ample.
2ème goût damandes grillées, avec une pointe de poivre et de girofle.
3ème nez dun brassin sacré, avec des fruits mûrs, des pruneaux.
3ème goût sur léquilibre de saveurs, dune grande délicatesse avec 
bien sûr une chaleur due à la teneur alcoolique, mais qui agit plutôt 
comme un soutien et une structuration des diverses saveurs.
Superbe, voire grandiose. Un véritable symbole de ce que doit être
une vraie bière dabbaye, avec toute les nuances que peut apporter
le savoir-faire trappistin.
La longueur sannonce déjà savoureuse et régulière.
La levure est teintée de douceur et de classe.
La finale ne peut se définir que comme sublime, et pour ceux qui
acceptent les superlatifs : sublimissime.
Question finale : qui peut coter cette bière en dessous de 5 ?
Pour moi, ma note est de 330 sur 100 (identique à ma note sur la 
trappiste Rochefort 8 qui est en fait de 9,2 abv, donc très proche 
de cette Chimay bleue).

Appearance (4/5): Pours a dark, muddy reddish-brown (Dr. Pepper?), with a creamy, light brown, two finger head that fully diminishes and leaves little lacing. A little sediment.

Aroma (8/10): Plum, raisin, florals, toffee, black pepper, cloves, wood, earth, chocolate, and licorice. Very complex yet nothing really dominates. Well balanced and sophisticated.

Taste (8/10): Begins with sweet plums, raisin, toffee, and chocolate, which dies off to reveal a very soft, earthy bitterness that fills the mouth and lasts for quite a while. Sweetness is a little more muted then in other abbey ales i have tried, but definitely present. Very little alcohol taste.

Palate (4/5): Medium/full body, lively carbonation, smooth and slightly dry texture, with a soft, warming finish.

Overall (17/20): Extremely good beer, but something keeps me from rating it higher... Very soft and very well blended; I guess this beer ""relaxes"" me with its excellence, but other Trappists ""excite"" me with theirs.

There is definitively some alcohol warmth here, but its quite well hidden. Belgian yeast makes its way through and creates caractheristic fruitiness towards raisins and plums. Not as much Weizen-fruitiness in the taste as in the aroma. Sweetness, fruit and some alcohol dominate the finish.

Aroma of yeast, chocolate malts, fruitcake.  The flavour is very complex - as you would expect from 9% ABV.  Syrup, Christmas cake, some smoked/roasted notes, some bitterness to prevent it from becoming too sweet.  The mouth feel is quite something - just the right level of carbonation plus it paradoxically burns and soothes at the same time.

2312,"2012-02-22",4.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 6/11/2009.  Poured from a 75 cl bottle into my Chimay branded goblet.

Chimay Grande Réserve pours a brown sugar color with a nice level of head. The head slowly relents, making the lively carbonation more visible for a while. 

Cherry and dark fruit malt is the primary scent, with a little bit of vanilla and alcohol present as well. A careful, if not hidden collection of smells.

A smooth, balanced flavor from start to finish. The cherry and dark fruits are quite noticeable, but less dominant than in the smell. Some light spices make an appearance, as do vanilla and brown sugar. For 9% though, the alcohol is very nuanced. The malt is wide and deep; there is almost no hop flavor. A slightly medicinal aftertaste reminds me it is time for the next sip. 

A very balanced feel on the tongue. Not especially carbonated, but not too thick either. Really it is just the right balance for a beer of this ABV. 

Such a classic beer, at the end of the glass all I can do is think about the next bottle. A great beer to relax with.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

T - Im not sure what keeps this one from being considered a Belgian quad. Fits right in with abt 12 in my opinion.

Once poured you will notice a nice aroma with this beer, a good mix of malts, Belgian yeast, bread, raisin, brown sugar and a nice floral note in there too!

There was also a hint of raisins, the sweetness of dark fruits and caramel.  It poured with a dark caramel, chocolate appearance with a tan, sparse head.  When I sipped it, I first feel the bubbles dancing on my tongue, then I taste a strong alcohol which is slightly bitter.  It has some sweetness to it mingled with a touch of sour and bitter.  I remember this beer being better the first time, but it wasnt as cold either.  Perhaps if I warm it in my hands, the full flavors will come out.  As I type, the aftertaste is pleasant, reminding me of my childhood and warm breads and figs.  Overall, I rate this as an excellent beer, and would definitely try it again, well worth the price.

This is one of those beers that I am happy that we can get them in any supermarket here, and not that expensive either.
I enjoyed this brew years and years ago and still do to this day.
Had different ones with different years and different ages and you can taste the difference. But one thing you cant taste is the lack of body.
Sometimes the maltyness is more present, other time the darker spices and darker fruits have a more dominant character.

2312,"2011-11-10",4.6,"2010 Bottle, cellared for around 9months
Bottle (330ml) sampled at home from a Brewdog branded teku glass:

Surprisingly sweet but still not overly, it smells of dark roasted malts and a strong but very pleasant alcohol aroma to it. There is a fair bit of fruit to this one as well like dates and perhaps some fig. I also detected some brown sugar and vanilla as well but this seems to come and go. As the beer sits and gets a chance to open up a little some chocolate and spice become more pronounced as well. A very complex smelling beer & one that is great on the nose.

Pours a dark sort of reddish brown almost chestnut colour with a tan white head about two fingers width high. The head appears quite bubbly that stays put for quite some time before finally reducing to a thin lacing over the surface of the beer. It may have something to do with the fancy teku glass I poured it into but even after the head recedes this one still looks fantastic.

Again quite sweet upfront with a a faint alcohol kick to it that is part sugar, part spice. Some good chocolatey malts and hints of caramel along with the dark fruits noted in the smell. An amazing taste to this one with a malty sweetness and a great creamy taste added to the fact the beer is incredibly well balanced and tastes great.

Medium bodied and quite rich on the palate with medium carbonation. It is really smooth and goes down much easier than a 9% beer should. There is still a solid alcohol kick to it and the finish is relatively light in bitterness.

Simply amazing, this beer is without a doubt one of the best I have tried so far. It has great depth and an fantastic smell coupled with a solid feel and brilliant taste, its almost perfect. No doubt one that Ill find myself going back to time and time again, perhaps not quite as much as some slightly less rich beers but definitely a world class ale & one that you should definitely try if you havent already. Ill be picking up a few more of these to cellar pretty soon.

2312,"2011-04-29",5.0,"UPDATED: JUL 28, 2011 75cl bottle from a beer retailer. It pours a very dark brown (almost black) liquid with reddish tones and a high and consistent high head that leaves a nice lacing. Delicious look. The aroma is yeasty and fruity, with some spices. I can smell dark fruits, ripe pears, fresh bread, a little herbal hops and a roasted malts base; impressive. It is nice the way the 9% of alcohol are completely blent with the brew. It tastes likewise, with a good deal of yeast and a complete malt base, with dark fruits, ripe pears, a little light caramel, general mild roastiness and even a little wood. The palate is perfect: a little prickle in the mouth and the tongue from the calmed but lively carbonation (as well as the alcohol), a full body with a very dense sensation in the mouth. It has a great and long finish: sweetness, some caramel and roasted malts; mild but lasting. Some herbal hints also. There is almost no bitterness (nor dryness) in this beer, being basically sweet. Smart presentation (bottle and crown cap) for my favourite one. No beer can make me feel like Chimay Bleue does. Might be the best in the world.","Sausalito, California, USA","12HundredBaud"
2312,"2011-04-27",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2014 Appearance: The little bugger is an exploder upon opening, be warned. Bottle into a *Westmalle* (gasp) trappist glass. Dark bronzey and reddy-brown, very gorgeous red color when placed in the sunlight. Some floaty stuff, and the head is thick and foamy with a very light brown coloration. Quite active carbonation. Looks very ""happy"" if you will, and its quite beautiful. 

Aroma: Sweet, like dry fruits, complemented by a dark, earthy and woody smell and a small hint of yeastiness which reminds me of bread a bit. Reminds me of black licorice somewhat too.

Taste: A darkish, sweet taste almost like brown sugar that gets just a little bitter; you can taste the malt in this one. Aftertaste is a light bitterness along with alcohol, kinda like the stronger cough candies. Again, reminds me of black licorice. VERY nice. 

Palate: Smooth, though foamy and almost oily and dare I say thick, though not in a bad way. Leaves a residue behind in your mouth that feels very active and alive. Warming too. Lots of carbonation.

Overall: Very nice, cheaper and easier to find than all of the Rochefort, but not quite as good, but I guess you get what you pay for. Not a beer to drink all the time, everyday, but I wont feel guilty cracking one open with a good meal every few days or so. This is a good ""introductory beer"" that I will recommend to many who are interested in trying something decent for once.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","RD400F"

The appearance is a hazy brown. Aroma was nominal, I found. I just couldnt pick up much, aside from some sweetness. The flavor, however, was quite pronounced and strong- this beer is very wine like. There was a good balance between the barley and hops, so I wasnt really able to pick up one or the other ingredient. Lots of over-ripe fruits (prune?) show up here. And, alcohol really makes its presence known. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy, and Chimay ""Blue"" finishes dense. This is a sipper for sure. Overall, I thought this was very good, yet not excellent. Yet, Im sure that with all the character this beer has, I do need to try this more than once.

Malts, especially dark fruity ones- plums, currants, dried berries- stand out here. Not extremely yeasty but just enough to provide a light tang to the aroma. A light spiciness- cloves, very light black pepper- is also here.

Quite sweet, much like the aroma; I detect a lot of the same dark fruits, alongside brown and candy sugar flavors. Hints of chocolate, bread, and the aforementioned (still minor) yeast make this one complex and enjoyable. With warmth, the dark fruits take on a grapy/raisiny/winy flavor.

Medium/full-bodied with moderate carbonation (a little less than I expected from a Belgian). Somewhat smooth, with a light warming effect from the alcohol.

Taste is sweeter. Roasted malts, butterscotch, dark bread, some syrup, some dark fruit and a certain bitterness. Alcohol is warming. Carbonation is wild. Body is big.
So far I cant see its greatness. One day I suppose...","Stockholm, SWEDEN","Mad_Ferret"
2312,"2011-02-14",3.5,"Poured into a Chimay goblet.

4.5 A: Murky medium brown color. Two plus fingers of super creamy light tan head with great retention and good amounts of lacing. Very good so far.

3.5 S: The nose is too weak, but pleasant. Main aromas that can be picked out are yeasty clove, plum, and dark candi sugar.

4.0 T: The taste is a lot stronger than the nose, which is much preferred. Raisin, plum, and tobacco fruitiness. Clove and pepper spiciness. Nutty with a bit of toastiness. Solid.

4.0 M: Lighter body. Good spritzy carbonation. Goes down pretty easy.

4.0 D: Definitely a solid offering, but I think there are some US breweries making stuff just as good at lower non-import prices. Still, this is something to enjoy from time to time. Good all around, but could use an infusion of power into the aroma.

2312,"2011-02-10",3.7,"After finding three of the seven trappist ales available at my local Carrefour I indulged about bought one of each. Given its reputation, I decided to start with the Chimay Bleue in a 33cl bottle. I was not disappointed. 
It poured a dark and cloudy chocolate/caramel color into the glass and left a creamy head which did not disappear right away, but left an enjoyable froth on the sides of my glass.
It had a much fruitier fragrance than I expected given its strength and color with yeast in for good measure. I actually found my mouth water when i wafted it in.
Again, its flavor surprised me. I have tried my fair share of beer at and over 9% apv and I usually find them overpowering but not this one. It had good dried fruit and bread/grains to the palate with a pleasant malt without the over powering sensation of a high alcohol content. It finished a mild bitter and left me swirling, smelling and sipping until it was done. I did not want to gulp it at all, which in this case was a good thing. 
Given that I am new to the Trappist beers I may have to come back to this review at some point in the future. I am not, however new to Belgian beers and this is one fine example of a good strong Belgian Ale. Undoubtedly worth a try by anyone who loves beer.","TAIWAN","jhubeifc"

2312,"2011-01-12",4.3,"2009 bottle. Rich blackberry and dates hit the nose the second the cap is opened, before theres even been a chance to pour it into its matching Trappist glass.

From the glass you also can pick up a deep, rich sweetness not unlike port, as well as the immediate berry and date aromas.

On the tongue it begins with malt, toffee and spices, followed by the deep port-like flavours and a dry, lightly tart finish with warming alcohol. Barely a hint of hops to speak of - the rich complexity derives mostly from the malt and Belgian yeast. Silky mouthfeel.

Given a few more years ageing this could be spectacular. For the meantime its an excellent example of the style; perhaps a nose or two behind the Rochefort 10.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","beardfear"

Quelques secondes sont suffisantes pour saisir toute la complexité de cette merveilleuse concoction : le malt est légèrement rôti, aux accents de pain brun grillé, doucement caramélisé avec une fine fragrance de cacao.  Les esters fruités sont modérément présents et prennent la forme de prunes et de raisins en légère confiture.  Lalcool, qui est peu intense, partage son odeur agréable avec des fleurs fraichement coupées.  Le goût est bien peu différent des arômes avec des grains maltés qui laissent sur les papilles des notes subtilement rôties, des saveurs imbriquées de levure fruitée et quelque chose comme des saveurs florales épicées.  En bouche, le liquide, qui a une structure passablement étoffée, est remué par des bulles dune grande finesse qui sont, à mon sens, un peu paresseuses.

2312,"2010-11-17",3.9,"Bottle to trappist glass. Pour is brown like cola with a soapy head that fades quickly, and you can hear the carbonation like pouring a soda.

2312,"2010-11-15",4.0,"Cloudy brown with a tan head that is course and disappears quickly.  Aroma is of refreshing yeast/apple, spiced bread, and a bit of cider.  Flavor is overwhelmingly apple-yeast-spice-alcohol up front, very refreshing.  This is then overtaken by a more bready, spicy flavor as the yeast subsides.  This is incredibly drinkable, and much more apple-yeast, and less harsh spiciness than I remember.  Tickling, fuzzy carbonation with a light body also makes this a nice break from the other big beers Ive been drinking lately, or the not-so-fine BDSAs Ive been attempting to brew lately.","Providence, Rhode Island, USA","PapaSkeetSkeet"

Overall aroma was exactly that of The Cheeky Monk Belgian Beer Cafe in Denver, CO.  Though to be more specific, it was beautifully yeasty with a primary note of blueberry, accompanying other Belgian-ish dark fruits.  Taste was fruit centric, the blueberry from the aroma coming back into play, with the standard Belgian characteristic tastes of yeast and a touch of malt.  A whisper of Christmas-like spice, sweet but not cloying, warm yet not too powerful on the alcohol.  Finely carbonated behind a silky smooth texture.

Pours a deep red-brown with a huge off-white head. Malty nose with toffee and some berry-like sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick, with a low amount of carbonation I find very pleasant. Aroma has hints of caramel, raisins and something I can only describe as ""general fruitiness"", but leaning mostly towards banana. Nice bitterness around the edges. The 9 % abv is quite noticable. Aftertaste is short and malty. Overall Im a little disappointed and unimpressed, since this one is so highly regarded. Nothing wrong with it, but my expectations were very high.

The nose is of candied sugar and a dominant yeast character that brings to mind ginger snaps and freshly baked bread.  There is alcohol up front, but this gives way to the hops.  In the mouth its drier than I expected, and drier than most quads; though it shares those essential qualities of spices, malts and honey.  The hops seem fresh on this.  The body is medium with a high level of carbonation.  Again the yeast is strong and leads on into the finish where the beer grows a certain tartness.

Its quibbling, but its the truth: if you are going to spend $12 on a bomber of Belgian ale, you should go with Bernardus Abt, Malheur 12, or Chimay blanche. This remains one of the finest ales in the world, but its plum flavors succumb to the tiniest hint of sourness in the flavor. The body is also thinner than in some of those other classics, but that is quibbling indeed. A delightful beer that pairs beautifully with beef, the fact that I can readily name other beers that are better than this one is a tribute to other brewers rather than an insult to these noble monks.","Athens, Georgia, USA","bjt512"

2312,"2010-08-01",4.1,"Murky brown with a soft khaki head which fades quickly into a thin film lined by a thicker collar. Thats okay. As big as my Blue is, I dont expect all that much head to linger around; itd just get in the way of her nose. Melted brown sugar, nutmeg, and molasses are slather atop candied fruits: prunes, dates, figs, and raisins. A dash more candied sugar and I move right into a vineyard of black grapes and fine ruby Porto. More brown sugar sprinkles and visions of Christmas cake, hold the sugarplums, bring me to canned black cherries. Oh yes, heaven is here once more and all is right in my world. As much as I could smell my Chimay all day long, there be drinking to be done. Some will pooh-pooh the effervescence brought on by bottle-conditioning, but Blue is a rich sweet heavy brew whose playful effervescence serves the very important task of cleansing your palate for a continually pleasurable quaffing session without being overpowered by cloying sweetness. Molasses and spice mingle with nutmeg while my tastebuds take in the fruit-felt bounty of raisins, prunes, black cherries (fresh and canned), and grapes before ending in licorice. There is a pervasive candied sugar sweetness which isnt overpowering thanks in part to her effervescent body. Her palate centers all immediate pleasures on the top of my tongue, though as we further our temptuous relationship, the back of my tongue and throat dries with spice and wood. For a brief moment, I have flashes of tropical paradise in the form of candied pineapple, and then she is gone. As my Blue warms, her flavors continue to melt into, with, and around each other in practiced Belgian Trappist artistry. As ruby Porto warms my body and soul, I find my Chimay chalice empty. Thats okay though; I still have the other half of my 750ml bottle to savor further.


I can definitely taste how with more age the Chimay Grande Reserve (Blue) would grow drier and develop richer ruby Porto notes. The potential was already there and growing with just a little over a year in the bottle. A beer to enjoy fresh and laid down, never buy just one.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

O- I find this more drinkable as it warms. The 9% ABV does not hide in this one at all. It is a complex and enjoyable Belgian ale meant to be treated with care. Good and something I am willing to revisit-but not sure it is worth $5 for a 11.2 oz bottle.

2312,"2010-04-18",3.5,"11.2oz bottle. Aged 5 months. Nearly exploded on me when I opened it, disturbing all the yeast, so I got a rather yeasty pour and cant say what the clear brew is like.  Pours a very dark brown, almost black. Off-white head. Smell of Belgian yeast. Slight hayish flavor with that yeast REALLY taking over in the end. A very good beer if it werent for my unreadiness for secondary fermentation and lousy pouring technique.","New Mexico, USA","doomfistinc"

Im afraid I didnt leave it standing long enough and when I popped the cork all of the sediment on the bottom stirred up in the bottle so it poured with some serious chunks.

2312,"2010-04-13",4.5,"Nice cloudy brown body, with a reddish hue. Creamy beige head. Pretty good head retention.

The aroma is full of fresh plums, sour cherries, and a bit of green apple. Some pleasant yeastiness, some mild spiciness (clove, cinnamon). Some roasted malts, with hints of caramel.

The taste starts out very fruity, with lots of fresh plums and some sour cherry-like tartness. Then you get some caramel breadiness, with just a hint of chocolate. The finish is still fruity, with just a bit of dryness and very light bitterness.

Exceptional is a good way to describe the mouthfeel. Its very smooth, yet somewhat crisp. Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated. Not boozy for a 9% beer. Some warming sensation at the swallow. Very pleasant overall!

The one bottle I had went down very easily and smoothly. I guess the drinkability is good for a strong ale, but moderation is strongly advised here, because the alcohol is quite well-masked!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","DenisLD"

2312,"2010-03-14",4.2,"Bottle.

A - Deep tawny brown with a good sized off-white head. Sticks around for a while.

S - Lots of dark fruit and spice (mostly clove). There are also hints of malt and alcohol. Smells quite Belgian.

T - Rum soaked dark fruit (raisin, fig, date, currant), Along with a general spiciness (predominantly clove), Alcohol is also fairly prominent, much more than in other similar beers. There is also a good amount of dark sugar and caramel, but these are not too cloying. Very slight bitterness and the end balances these out a bit.

M - Moderate carbonation and probably on the higher side of medium bodied. It probably could be a bit fuller, but that is just kind of nit-picking.

D - Could probably drink 2 in a night and be fine, any more would probably be too much (even if the ABV was lower). It definitely hits the spot though, and is a nice beer to sip at night.

Notes: I do really like this beer. However, compared to other similar and comparable beers, I dont think it holds up as well. Not really a knock on it, it is just in great company. That said, the availability of this beer is certainly a plus, and if I saw it for a good price, I would be all over it.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Nose is boozy, with lots of figs and raisins. Taste is vinous; candy sugar, yeast notes and toffee all emerge within seconds. Aftertaste is boozy, almost like port wine and caramel-like. A nice brew, although not quite up there with its genre ""counterparts"": the quadrupels. I know its not really in the same category, but it feels like it shouldve been, particularly when the rest of the Chimay series (rouge = dubbel, blanche = triple) kinda promises a quad at the end of the series. It also seems to aspire to reach f.ex. Rochefort 10 in complexity, however failing to do so. Nevertheless, good value for your money and a very nice beer in general.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

The aroma is nicely balanced with dates, apricots and brown sugar.  There is a subtle but enjoyable fermenting fruit alcohol bite in the nose as well.  The dates translate to raisins when you taste the beer.  There are light wood tones, faint traces of banana and sweet malts as well.

2312,"2010-01-22",3.8,"I really like Chimay Blue, but Ive recently come to realize that its much more of a gateway beer to Belgian awesomeness than it is a wonderful example of what is brewed there. Its perfect for introducing fizzy water fans to the world of real beer flavor.

Now that Ive tried many more Belgian ales (and especially other Trappist ales like Rochefort, Westmalle and Achel) I find Chimay Blue to be less than great when you compare against the benchmark they set. It touches your palate with a sense of excitement but it quickly dissipates. That makes it incredibly pleasant to drink, but dont expect to be wowed by flavor, aroma, maltiness or yeast while you devour this very drinkable ale. 

Its got a good balance of each, but that balance makes it less distinctive and memorable. A very good beer, but not one I will sell my soul for.","New Hampshire, USA","brikelly"

Yeasty with a light spice and just a hint of rum-like alcohol. Flavor is similar. Fairly full malty sweetness with a nice toffee and caramel. Deeper fruits, mainly plums and raisin stand out a bit more than the citric, apricot, and grape flavors from the aroma. Lots of yeast with a light spice and I get a faint roast as well. Finishes complex and fairly dry with a light bitterness as the alcohol presents itself with a light, but pleasing warmth. Aftertaste lingers for a moderate duration. Medium body with a creamy carbonation. Overall, my favorite of the three offered by Chimay. Complex and well balanced.

330 ml bottle. Freshness date on label (Best before end of 2013).

The pour is dark-brown with red hues around the edges. There are lively bubbles and an off-white 2 cm head that stays around for a while but then settles into a nice layer of creamy foam. Some lacings.

Aromas of dark fruits, primarily cherries, are present. There is also a smell of wood, and a slight sting of alcohol hits the nose.

The taste is amazing and clearly triumphs the smell of the beer. Up front are tastes of ripe fruit - cherries and apples - and raisins. Perhaps, there are also some notes of spices here. The malts provide a sweetness to the brew. A slight bitterness accompanied by pleasant alcohol characterizes the finish. Towards the end the alcohol becomes more prominent.

The beer is medium-bodied. Carbonation is lively and the bubbles coupled with the creamy foam provides a nice mouthfeel.

This is a very complex and delicious beer which I really enjoy.

Deep, dark fruits dance on top of sweet roasted malts. Caramel and brown sugar play a sweet song, written by toffee. Swirling overripe bananas dance by, barely able to stand, but still present and making a good show of it. Yeast is trying to hold them up but has been drinking Port all night and is now chewing bubblegum, trying to hide it.

Dark fruits and tasty, sweet malts dominate. Caramel and molasses. Nice spicy bite at the end. Good yeasty notes.

2312,"2009-11-15",4.3,"Aromas of spice (nutmeg, clove, anise) carmelized brown sugar fruits (raisin, orange, plum, banana) and a blue cheese like yeastyness. The nose is deep and alluring, strong and inviting. Some carmelly malt is present as well, but the floral spicy yeast dominates.

Flavor is like the best apple cider you ever had.  A woody malt start flows slowly into a rich fruity mid with carmelly finish.  A delicate and incredilbe transition of flavors, like really good scotch. The spices noted in the nose intermingle with rich dark fruit malts and elegant belgian yeast in a most pleasant balancing act.  You taste alchohol but its only one character in a complex mingle.

Palate is equally complex and marked by smooth and definite transitions.  Mild tang and tingle build to sour character while the mouth becomes increasingly silkly. After goin thro a dry phase there is a  sweet whisper of a finish, slightly sticky mouth, like you just ate a nectarine.

I dont use perfect as a description very often because I want to leave the perfect beer out there as an unattainable ideal, but this beer is damn near perfect. Its because of beer like this that so many american belgian style ales fail miserably.","San Luis Obispo, California, USA","chokmah33"

2312,"2009-11-02",4.3,"At the crack of the cap, the pungent aroma of the beer hit me with an almost fruity, citrus-y essence. Also, I could tell it was going to be a bitter beer due to the ever-prevalent smell of hops. As I poured it into my glass, it produced a very dark, amber, golden color. It was a little translucent - bordering opaque. It formed a white/gold head that was retained for a good 5 minutes or so. After I let the beer settle, I took a taste and got a hint of fruit - a bitter one; almost reminiscent of the peel of a citrus fruit (orange). There was also a bit of spice from the roasted ingredients used in the beer. As the beer enters, you can taste the alcohol and hops right from the get-go. After the initial hit, the beer mellows out quite nicely and on the way down it smooths out. It almost seems like wine with the progression of textures and sensations. I also noticed the aroma of the wood that the beer was fermented in. Overall, this was a very filling beer. It would go nice with a small, but hearty, meal. If you have too much food, I can see it overfilling you. The bitter taste of the beer is strong, but pleasant and not overpowering to the overall flavor. I greatly enjoyed this beer.","Long Valley, New Jersey, USA","dekeq"

It was neither outspoken fruity nor bitter, not sweet and sour neither. Some graininess in its mouth feel (dust). Modestly lasting after-taste. It is balanced and that goes hand in hand with less clear palate. Too high priced compared to the 33 cl version which seemed more tasty to me.

The aroma brings fruit cake, raisons, Belgian character malts, and some yeast-derived dark fruity esters (which I found surprising, given the use of the Chimay house yeast).  The palate is deeply and complexly malty, showing some Munich at first, Special B, and perhaps a touch of aromatic malt.  The malt gives way to a deep and pleasing note of dark fruit.  The finish is semi-dry, and brings just barely a touch of alcohol that is more warming than present from a flavor perspective.

2312,"2009-06-05",3.5,"Very dark cloudy brown with a big rock head, but the heads retention leaves something to be desired, and why is there no lacing? Is this an old bottle? Very disappointing looking pour, Ive seen this beer pour better. The smell is a woody alcohol with tingly spice, and just a hint of yeast, the aroma is a touch weak but still good. The taste is smooth and yeasty, Im noticing some cheery in the finish. Aged wood and maybe some nuttiness, very complex and hard to break down beer. The beer seems to be a touch thin (did I cellar this bottle to long?) and tons of carbonation to tickle the throat. This beer is very good and very complex and I think just had a bad bottle because I swear its better then I scored it","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","Cirrhosis"
2312,"2009-06-05",3.8,"Its been about 4 years since I have had this beer and since I have been on a little Belgian kick lately I thought Id pick this one up tonight. Pours a hazy dark colour that cannot be classified as brown or black...but more of a deep hazy amber with more light showing through at the base of the glass with a nice smooth round head on top. Smell is rather faint but cheery, brandy and other fruit notes can be picked up. Taste is very balanced and smooth as hell. The 9% alcohol is barely detected and the finish retains some nice bite of hops. The subtle qualities of this beer cannot be understated: smooth texture, soft carbonation, a slight wine-like feeling, but retaining a nice bready, biscuity backbone. I could taste lots of figs, apricots, and some small bits of smoke.","JAPAN","buzzoven"

Strong, full flavor of anice, dark fruit, raisins, malt, well-masked alcohol, and something like a restaurant peppermint right before the finish .  I see why its a standard bearer, if overpriced.

Ar: Port, malt, bread, dark fruits...fruits galore. Huge yeasty perfume. Ap: Poured a large head that dissipated a little too rapidly, but left some interesting fungal lacing. Red-brown color that was too rich to be rust and hid enough secrets in its murky depths. Hinted at a fullness that wasnt quite there though (needs to be aged a couple of years). Fl: Candy sugar and fruity esters w/ succulent plums and more clearly, dry fruits coming through. Figs, raisins et al. Caramel and yeasty bread come through as well.

2312,"2009-04-29",4.1,"330mL bottle from Regionals  from a Chimay glass of course. Pours a murky deep brown with a big fluffy off white head. Looking very sexy. 
The aroma is dominated by dark fruits, plum and raisin. Nice and spiced too, with a bit of yeast and brown sugar. Its a familiar Belgian aroma, but strong and in your face. Which I like.
The brown sugar sweetness dominates the first sip, a bit sweet. The next sip shows more malt, those raisins show up, some mild bitterness is there. It becomes much easier to drink with each successive sip. Spices come in stronger as it warms, becomes quite a nice beer. The 9% ABV is completely hidden.

Bottle brown, 330 ml
Appearance: Pours deep and dark mahogany brown with dark ruby shades, very opaque, murky, not see - through, very weak but natural carbonation, head is initially small, slowly decreasing to minimum but stil lasting, no lacing, rather non - dynamic appearance with nothing extraordinary to admire.
Aroma: Very strongly aromatic beer, at first coocoo candy, moderately alcoholic, hiding veru robust and strong, essential character, woody - nutty touch (especially wallnut), notes of raisin, resin, Porto wine, strong spices, leavy, herbal hops (really well hopped beer), red wine grapes, flowery accents, especially rose. When it comes to malt there is a definitley caramelly - toasty to roasty character, fat yeasty character at tha background, raspberry, cherry, wildberry, black current, pine, forest fruits, prune, plum.
Flavour: Again like in other Chimay beers very strong taste at front hits you with alcoholic warmth, full body, great deal of yeast, fat wheaty - malty sweetness, additional dark and roasted malt, off spins of top fermentation, prune, plum, forest fruits with black currant and cherry on top, raisin, rasin, other red fruits, very complex and more and more alcoholic towards the end what is positively manifested in the warmth on palate making other complexities of flavour alive and kicking. Finish duration is long.
Palate: Body is full, texture is dry, carbonation of the body is weak, finish feel is heavy but pleasant alcoholic and highly astringent, very clean and pleasant.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

RE-RATE 3/29/11 Bottle from World Market.  This beer pours elegantly.  No other word can describe it.  It has a hazy maroon color that touches on brown and rouge tints.  Lots of bubbles add to the already solid beige head.  Very nice.

Ive continued to warm this beer as much as I can through natural means as I know this will release all the aromas that the brewers have intended.  The aroma certainly does not disappoint.  Lovely dark fruit and sweet Belgian candied sugars fill the nostrils.  Easy grains and more Belgian fruit/yeast flavors follow behind.  Lovely.

Flavor is lovely grape juice, plum, raisin, sweet malt, sugar and Taylor Swift.  I imagine that if Taylor were a beer she would be sweet and innocent.  I mean that in the most non-creepy way possible.  Light bitter finish reminds you that this beer has a bit of a kick to it; and the tingle on the tongue confirms.  This is one of my favorite beers to date.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"

Seems like im getting different wonderful flavors on all parts of my tounge, front, sides, middle and back. Sweetness up front, getting some bitterness on the sides of my toungue, and then a little of the alcohol in the back of the mouth. Mouthfeel on this is out of this world.

Seu corpo apresentou tons marrom-claros, densidade média, turbidez e moderada formação de colarinho. No aroma, farejei algumas coisas que não esperava, como a suave presença de café, notas cítricas lembrando lima, bala toffee e frutas vermelhas - a bela complexidade de uma BSA. No campo do sabor, o início foi permeado por leves dulçor e amargor, sensações estas que foram suplantadas por moderado amargor no final, este de curta duração. Percebi ainda um marcante toque de frutas secas no paladar, o que aumentou sobremaneira o charme dessa deliciosa cerveja. No paladar, fui premiado com um corpo médio-cheio, de textura oleosa, forte carbonatação e forte final metálico","União da Vitória, BRAZIL","danielyabu"
2312,"2009-01-06",3.6,"11.2 oz small bottle.  No date.  Into Chimay glass.  Rich brown with some red hue with a light tan head that starts big but fades fast to an 8th of an inch and holds - no lace.  Aroma is pretty solid and very typical of the style - sweet candy, vanilla, dough, dark fruity (like plums), some booze and licorice, and yeast.  The flavor is the same but a bit less yeasty and just a bit better in general.  Not overly sweet like many Belgians, but still sweet.  Chimay hides the alcohol pretty well in this one, though it does heat the stomach pretty noticeably.  Medium to light bodied with over-the-top carbonation like most other Belgians, all of which I am not a huge fan of.  Overall: a solid brew, but wouldnt want more than one (or even more than about 8 ounces).  A generally over-hyped overrated style IMO -- I just don’t get much complexity or sense much drinkability from it, and a good style has to have one or the other.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

Appearance: The body has a beautiful deep dark brown colored body with dark ruby highlights and a slightly hazy body. The head builds up tall and thick with an abundance of small tiny, tight packed bubbles. It has a creamy off white color and good retention as it slowly settles down to a light thin covering. Lacing is very slick and minimal.

Smell: The aroma has an intoxicating mix of sweet malt, earthy yeast and dark fruity esters.

Taste/Mouth feel: Ageing only adds more complexity and character and each sip will reveal different flavor notes. To start there is a nice lightly roasted, almost smoky malt with different layers of dark fruits that is revealed as it warms. Plums, figs, dates, dark and golden raisins are some fruits I noted and all is surrounded buy the presence of a pleasant warming port like alcohol. Its palate is full and well rounded with a smooth feel and mellow carbonation.

2312,"2008-08-02",3.9,"330mL bottle from an in person trade. Pours a dark, murky brown, slight orange tinge to it making it appear copper toned when held to the light, with a smaller than expected white head. Aroma right away is what you would come to expect, yeasty wheaty maltyness, with the obligatory dark fruity aspects. Flowery and perfume-like, which is quite elegant and pleasant as it warms. Flavour is more of the same, with a decent thick feel to the body of this brew. Herbal-like hopping is present as well. Good sweet malts in the aftertaste. My only big problem with this is what I have with a lot of beers like it, in that I just dont really get much complexity from it. Its probably a pretty fresh bottle, and with plenty of age Im sure it could be something great. I just dont have the patience for such things. All in all a good one though. I meant to give it a higher rating but the numbers just dont seem to add up the way Id like them to. It does of course get much better as it warms.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

This is more a watery Scotch ale or barley wine than it is a fat, hallucinatory monastic bruiser. Seriously disappointing, and not for the first time. I could brew better in my shed.                                       
(original rate)...Porterish black-brown topped with a creamy beige. Sillky mouthfeel. Apple and caramel opening up in the nose as it warms. But an oddly underwhelming and flavourless ale for the ABV. Dour and sugary with an unsubtle waft of spiritous booze and a fairly caustic bitterness in the finish. No spice, no roastiness, certainly no hops (extract). Anonymous milky maltiness that looks, smells and feels far more interesting than it tastes (6/4/4/4/11/2.9)","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

2312,"2008-07-05",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2008 Absolutely zero head on this baby.  Another much-maligned readily available belgian beer that has suffered due to its popularity.

Im fascinated by the different colours in the glass.  The outer rim seems light brown fading into a hazelnut utopia. The nose is a mixed bag of nuts and it has a malty, milk chocolate palatte.

The aroma is malty and mellow, but with a slightly sharp hint. Hits the lips like velvet. Smooth texture with a malty, only slightly bitter taste that ends with a hit of alcohol. I expected that this would go a bit skunky in the closet, considering the conditions, but it turned out to be a great, late night bev.

Thick chewy foam that held up in time. Did not expect such a nice head. This was medium brown, slightly nutty lemon aroma. Fantastic, rich taste. First to last sip was balanced and memorable. 

I paid $7.99 for this. Well worth it. I wish I could find it for $5 because Id keep about 5 of these in my fridge at all times. I just cant afford to drink this one other then for special times.","Florida, USA","jarndyce"

2312,"2008-03-01",4.1,"07 Bottling. Dark ryby brown, slowly vanishing beige head. Nose is sweet malty with warm spiciness and cooked, sweet roots? Without yeast, the flavor is bitingly bitter, dry and spicy with a hint of dark fruits. Pitching in the sediment smoothens the dryness and brings a more sweeter and fuller, a bit peppery finish. Even slight hop aroma too. Full bodied, small bubbled and foamy carbonation. Alcohol well hidden. 50-50% mix of this and the drier white one would be the perfect Chimay.","Turku; Pori, FINLAND","austone"

This brew is somewhat floral in scent.  Its appearance is probaly its worst attribute, but its solid as rock there too, with its dark brown color.  Its flavor is notably alchoholic, but it also speaks malt, which I love.  Palate feel...very much lingers in a good way.  No nasty after taste.  Brilliant!!!  If your reading this stop.

2312,"2008-02-27",4.0,"Had a mini quad tasting in April 07. Had this one after the Rochefort 10.

Picked up this 11.2oz bottle at Discount Drinks in Wyandotte.

Appearance: Pours a hazy brown color with a 1 finger tan head. The head fades quickly on this one. Slightly red around the edges. There is a little bit of lacing on my snifter. This looks very similar to the others, just not quite as nice.

Aroma: Starts with some dark fruits and a slight alcohol burn. This is followed roasted malts and more dark fruits, possibly cherry. The aroma is more pronounced as it warms, just like the others. Not as pronounced as the others.

Flavor: Starts sweet with some nice malt notes. There are hints of cherry and dark fruits. In the finish, there iswarming alcohol and some spicy hops. There is a nice malt background that balances all these flavors.

Palate: This starts creamy followed by the sweet dark fruits. These flavors hang for a short while. This is very smooth too. This doesnt seem like 9%, but after a few, you know it is. I could put back about 4 or so of these, but its best when comsumed slowly and enjoyed.

Overall. This finished last behind the Rochefort 10, Westy 12, and Abt 12. Another truely a world-class beer (as were the others) thats probably the most available of the four we had. The flavors and aroma are not as pronounced as the others, but its still damn good. Pick one or more up and see for yourself.","Allen Park, Michigan, USA","northernbrews"

The aroma was complex with dark fruits, raisins, some roasted malt, and earthy hops and yeasty tones.  The taste was a sour-bitter medley, with some fruity sweetness too, featuring a raisin flavor.

Caramelly and malty, the high alcohol content is definitely noticeable.  A lot of complex fruity aromas emerge...like different kinds of dried fruit.  Somewhat sweet, and not much bitterness.

It has a fruity aroma with a hint of butterscotch and honey.  It has a malty, fruity taste, and goes down smoothly.  It has no alcohol flavor whatsoever, but feels warm and fuzzy after it goes down. , most likely due to the high alcohol content and the the yeast still present in the bottle.

This is an incredible beer but its hard to accuratly describe the taste. Its diffrent every sip. Orange, cloves, cinammon, roast malt, toffee, chocolate, raisins and liqorice.

Jan 31, 2008 (1999 vintage). It was a very nice experience. Matured plums, portwine/madeira, some brown sugar, raisins and some soy sauce together with broth(?). Very, very nice experience but to be honest I think it was better a couple of years ago.

June 18, 2008 (2007 vintage). This is still a very good beer, but unfortunly I didnt find it that amazing this time. I prefer a Rochefort 8 every day over this one. I dont say this isnt high quality though. Probably need too store a couple of these, even though I like the fresh ones.  They need to ’’rest’’ standing a couple of weeks before drinking though... otherwhise they explode spreading beer all over the appartment. (4,3)

Oct 24, 2008: 1999 vintage (again). Pours a dark brown color with small, dying head. Its probably a lot due to the age and the alcohol.

2312,"2007-11-06",3.9,"Bottle (small - 330ml?). Reddish brown, very slightly cloudy. Loose off-white head. Subtle aroma, mainly yeasty. Forestaste is quite sharp, perhaps pears, quickly giving way to a richer sweeter raisin / malty taste with plenty of complexity. This in turn gives way to a bitter but rich aftertaste. Its full bodied with plenty of carbonation. Its high in alcohol and whilst that is apparent it certainly doesnt dominate. A great beer.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Pyobon"

2312,"2007-11-04",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2007 Bottle kept in my ""cellar"" (aka: the closet) for one year.  Pours a deep dark burgundy with a large fluffy off-white head.  Aroma has a lot to offer and its all rather subtle.  At first, plums, prunes, and raisins are the most noticable, but afterwards, I notice toasted almonds, brown sugar, molasses and vanilla.  All those sweeter notes are pretty subtle though.  Tastes initially of pears, quickly overtaken by brown sugar, a light toasted bread taste, almonds, cherries, light coffee and just the slightest warming bit of alcohol.  Finishes with a gentle but noticably bitter (in comparison to the rest of the beer) roasty flavor, a slight pear and raisin flavor, fading with a dirty earthy hop aftertaste.  Overcarbonated mouthfeel at first that can be solved with a lot of glass swirling.  Very drinkable for its strength, and kinda slick feeling.  I think one year took some of the edges of this beer and made the flavors even more well rounded.  This is just a classic strong Belgian ale, much smoother and subtler than competetors (at the risk of being slightly less exciting, maybe).


I gotta bump up my rating a bit.  The flavor of the second, more cloudy glass is just too good.  A bit of that yeast, but certainly not all of it, just makes this excellent.  A bit more vinous in the nose, yet a bit more vanilla in the flavor.  I had this beer years before rating number one, well before I graduated, and even at 360-something in the ratings numbers, its still awesome.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"
2312,"2007-11-04",3.6,"750 ml bottle shared with my son. Pours a murky medium brown with gold and red highlights. Large off white head. Minimal lace. I enjoyed this Belgian more than some Ive had because it was not so heavily carbonated. Taste was of dark fruits, brown sugar, and  a slight alcohol presence. Finish was mild and dry. I will admit I do not own a  Tulip or Trappist style glass, so I may have missed some flavors that others may taste.","Wilton, New Hampshire, USA","mcox90"

Ok this beer is lack luster in the appearance department pouring a murky muddy brown with slight burgundy hues and a nice creamy off white head that lasts very nicely. After the initial let down on the appearance this beer picks its game up big time. Sweet aroma of raisins, prunes, yeast, brown sugar, tropical fruit and a slight touch of alcohol perhaps Brandy. This gem has one of the most amazing palates I have ever experienced. Starts off with a full mouth feel and lively carbonation but as you swallow the body becomes light and the carbonation lessens to slide down your throat. Almost no aftertaste leaves you wanting another sip to recapture that moment of pure palate bliss. Sweet flavor of light yeast, sugar, raisin, and brown bread.

Light with dark fruit flavorprune, raisins, and a little leather.  Finish is very warm and sweet.  Among Chimays, I prefer the White; the flavor is more balanced and subtle.

One to respect. At 9 percent strength, you cant taste it.. Good lace effects on the glass that shows quality. The aroma is quite complex, you have the yeast foremost, with a slight roasted nut hue to it. The tase is much appreciated once you have a few sips. Yeasty, roasted nutty, with slight sweet hints of fruits and caramel, the aftertaste is exquisite too, not too bitter considering the yeast and strength.

Nonetheless, today theres still an ethereal other-worldly quality to them. A beer that instantly commands respect and exudes sophistication. Like a suave and confident statesman whos seen most everything, incorporated it into his consciousness and is all the wiser for it, this work of art exhibits tremendous balance, flavor and elegant restraint.  Poured into a trappist glass, 2007 bottle. Really packs a punch with me as well compared with all other 9% abv yet the intensity is beautifully blended quietly in the flavor. Medium head that reduces quickly but stays low for some time. Aroma says to you ""yes I have lots of complexity but dont need to show it off and bash you over the head with it"". Soft and warm mouthfeel, not as thick and chewy as many other strong ales Ive tried. Finish is relaxed and really sings. A truly excellent Belgian strong ale.","USA","goldbrew"

A beautiful dark opaque chestnut color with a big and wild off-white head that leaves a delecate layer of foam after a few minutes.

The flavor is sweet with lots of maltiness and some citrus, but the finish imparts some bitterness with the high ABV showing up  to close it off.   The mouthfeel is syrupy and thick, with good carbonation.   This is a good beer, maybe great, but I might like Chimay Red better because of its great balance of flavors.   Blue is definitely a complex and intense beer.   Im looking forward to trying another (8 4 8 4 16) - - - rerate:   750ml bottle, served in a Chimay glass.   This time around, I didnt pick up nearly as much of the flavor that I remember from before.   There was less sweetness and more yeastiness, and thats about it.   I really wasnt impressed.   Its possible that this was a consequence from coming across the pond this time, but a brew like this should stand up to that.   Disappointing.  Next up. I need to cellar some to see if it improves for me, like so many people claim that it does.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"
2312,"2007-08-30",4.2,"Pours a dark burgandy with a frothy beige head.  A sweet aroma of fruit and spice.  The scents come through in the flavor with fruits and brown sugar.  The alchohol is noticable but not over powering.  Great all around dark Belgian.","Lewes, Delaware, USA","ROGUE"
2312,"2007-08-26",4.5,"Wow, take that Budwieser, Ive discovered the real king of beer!  Been wanting to try this for a while... wish granted.  Nose is nutty rosted malt with a light floral/fruity scent.  Fantastic looking beer with a coppery brown hue posessing a nice toasted marshmallow head.  The mouthfeel on this beer is fantasticly perfect.  The flavor profile is as complex as I had hoped.  The yeast imparts the floral/fruity hints to a slightly nutty profile with a full roundhouse kick of malt.  Theres enough hops present to keep the beer balanced, but I couldnt really detect anything the hops may have added to the flavor profile.  Overall this is a fantastic beer.  Something to be drank daily if youre the son of a wealthy Texas oil man, but for a simple man like me, its a fantastic treat to be savored when I can ""treat"" myself.  Im a HUGE fan of pairing beer with food, this beer would seem to be great with alot of fare depending on what youre trying to accomplish; suggestions would be Dim Sum, well spiced seafood dishes, and something as rustic as an openfaced sandwich or stew.","Clinton, Mississippi, USA","Hinez57"
2312,"2007-08-25",3.7,"33cl bottle, pours dark brown with ruby highlights and a sizable frothy tan head that persists, good lacing.  Aroma is a bit lacking, but provides hints of dark fruits, applesauce, brown sugar, and some yeastiness.  Flavor is also solid, but a bit ""eh"", well rounded with some dark fruit, apple, and a bit boozy.  Palate is well carbonated and lively, with a lingering finish.  I had this a few times before my official entry into ""craft beer"", and remember being much more impressed than I am now.

Flavor is very toothsome, richly malty with hop hints and whispers of spice. Aftertaste has quite a bitter bite, but it is pleasant rather than nasty, like the kick of strong liquor. Unfortunately, the pleasant flavor does not persist and the alcohol bite dominates after it goes down. Still, it is an eminently drinkable ale.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
2312,"2007-08-13",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2007 Small bottle.   Was given a gift of a large bottle in 1996 soon after I started brewing.  I remember being at awe thinking about drinking beer made by monks.  Chimay blue was spectacular, and gave me a brewing goal.  I thought it was the best beer.  Around 2001-2002, I started to think the red version was better.  It was also about this time it seems Chimay was mass producing.  It wasnt until years later around 2003, that I started to appreciate many other beers, with a huge influence from ratebeer.  Now, Im finally rating my old favorite.  I probably havent tried it in over a year.  Pours with a head that disappears immediately.  There still carbonation, but just no head.  Hmmm?  Aroma of something fruity, not quite banana.  A bit too much alchohol in the nose.  Deep brown red amber color.  Great color.  Taste is good, on the sweeter side, but something is off, possibly the tiniest amount sourness.  Not quite the masterpiece I once thought it was.  Is it because of mass production, or improved taste buds.  I wonder if I could get a hold of an older bottle. 7/3/7/3/16:3.6
10/25/07:  Rerate.  I dropped this 33cL bottle and some leaked out the cap.  I stuck it in the frig for a month.  Just opened, and it still has carbonation!  What a surprize.  Rocket fast fading medium bubble head, that settles to a microbubble head.  Interesting.  Some buttery melanoidin malt aroma.  I think this bottle is over a year old from the dust on the bottle.

Aroma is fruity, but nose is not sensitive enough to tell what kind of fruit: it just smells nice. Flavor is again fruity, with a slight hint of alcohol (I must make it clear that the sense of alcohol is very different from that of most low-quality, mass-produced, high-alcohol beers Ive tasted; this one is just a pleasant hint).

Still, it does burn going down, which is not a good thing for a beer, so why this is 99th percentile is beyond me. This is nowhere as complex as the red label Chimay which has more pleasant fruit flavours.  This threw me for a loop & knocked me sideways for a bit .

It is strong and reminiscent of Bush, but has a subtlety that reminds me of Newcastle Brown Ale. It is superior to each of those beers in their own areas of expertise. There is a smoothness between foretaste to full-flavor and the resulting aftertaste. The change is not so wide as that famous one found in the English brew. Yet the superior flavor makes the subtle change an even more pleasant experience. There is a delicious combination of flavors tightly wound in an equally potent drink. Bush is wonderful. 12% with no overpowering alcohol taste. The Chimay Blue is no less potent. It is smoother and less bitter. It is similar in flavor, but more interesting and more refined.

I picked this up at a white elephant exchange around the holidays.  For whatever reason Ive been overlooking it until now.  I cant imagine why as it is one of the best beers I have had the chance to sample.  The only hard thing about it will hanging onto another bottle for three years to age it again.  The cork on this bottle said 08/03.
Aroma / Appearance - The half finger tan head danced over the top of the bronze body creating a beautiful scene.  A reddish tint gave it some more life.  The creamy nose consisted of caramel, chocolate, anise and black cherry.  A hint of fruits floated above it all creating a very dense and complex combination of scents.  I could smell this one for a while without ever taking a sip.
Flavor / Palate - The first sip unveiled a chewy rich tapestry of flavors.  Opening with cherries, chocolate and raspberry sorbet, it then morphs into black pepper and vanilla.  It is not quite on par with St Bernadus or Rochefort but it is so close that I would never turn it down.  The alcohol has a certain prescence that is evident but never threatens to overwhelm the palate.  For an almost four year old beer this had held up exceptionally well.  I wonder how long it would last.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Yeasty and winey with a quick wave of alcohol, that subsides to being pleasantly warming. Had as an aperitif - perfect for getting the juices going.

2312,"2007-05-04",3.1,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2007 Im re-rating this beer as I had it a long time ago, and had it again alongside the other two varieties of Chimay commonly available in the US (white and red) yesterday.  And I have to say that with the benefit of quite a bit more beer experience since my last rating, that I significantly over-rated this beer in my previous rating.  Yesterday, I found this beer is extremely mild, and while certainly not unpleasant or bad, I found it to be a bit boring.  Of the three varieties I had yesterday, this was definitely my least favorite.

Appearance was a dark brown/almost black color with a decently-formed whitish head with limited staying power.  Aroma was very mild and faint.  I got roasted malt and a bit of alcohol, but not much else.  Flavor was the highlight of this beer, but even that I found mild-mannered and rather unremarkable compared to other dark Belgian (or Belgian-style) beers Ive had.  A bit of roastiness and some alcohol, but not much else that you might expect like spiciness or fruit.  Mouthfeel was not bad, but unremarkable.

So Im left to explain why so many think so much of this beer while Im the odd-duck whos unimpressed.  And my hypothesis is this - that many folks (me among them) try this beer when first expanding their beer horizons, are wildly impressed by the difference, but havent yet revisited (as Im now doing) to compare against the craft/import beer adventures theyve had since breaking out with Chimay Blue.  Sound plausible?","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

2312,"2007-04-26",3.5,"Ive been a fan of Chimay bleu for six years, but since Ive been living in Auckland, temporarily, Ive noticed that the taste has changed dramatically -- for awhile, I thought it was just my imagination, but Ive since discovered that, somehow, likely during the shipping and handling process, the sediment left behind from bottle conditioning becomes diffusely distributed throughout the liquid, leaving it cloyingly sweet and hardly drinkable. As anyone familiar with bottle conditioned ale knows, theres a marked difference between a bottle that is properly handled, with the sediments on the bottom, and a bottle that has been jostled to the point where the sediments irreversibly alters the flavor, even after its been sitting on the shelf for awhile. Whatever shipping method is used to transport this otherwise top-of-the-line beer has spoiled it irreparably, and I feel sorry for those who are exposed to Chimay the first time in Auckland, because if they dont like sweet beer, they wont come back for more.","Davis, California, USA","pfhyde"

It pours a slightly murky reddish-brown with a small tan head. Aroma of dark malt, icing sugar, caramel and spice (notably clove, and something else I cant quite place). Body is lighter than I recall - this bottle has been aging for a couple of years in admittedly less than optimal conditions, so perhaps that had an effect? Flavour is quite restrained, but also complex - dark fruit, barley candy, licorice & herbs. Lovely stuff indeed, and much too easy to drink for a 9%er!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"

So in July 05 I felt ready to give it another try, and Im glad I did. It is dark brown with a lot of chunky sediment and the head is beige and nice. The aroma has notes of dark, ripe fruits and a bit of alcohol. The flavour is complex: warming alcohol, plum, raisin, port wine, caramel sweetness and a hint of licorice - and it mingles well into a higher and well balanced unity.

The head was excellent, it didnt get in the way of my drinking, as some heads have been known to do. Even though there is a high alcohol content it affect the beer, but enhanced its qualities.

The beer goes down very smooth, and is not like the Rouge or Cinq Cints  when it comes to feeling heavy. The other two Chimay Trappist Ales leave me feeling full. However, Chimay Bleue has a more complex variety of aroma and taste that will not make you feel like you just ate a whole turkey.

Yeast aromas turns fruity (mostly banana and apple) with hints of caramel and malt. This beer is highly carbonated, more so than just about any beer I have ever tasted.

Deep red colour with active carbonation (visibile only with a strong light behind the glass). Aroma is malty with overripe fruit and bread -- Christmas pudding!  Glorious full mouthfeel. Flavour has a real nip to it up front, receding to bananas and more bread. The strong alcohol level never intrudes too much but adds background warmth.

2312,"2007-02-20",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2008 2006 bottle.  Pours a hazy, deep, dark ruby-brown color with a mostly fully head, beige, and fizzy, but still creamy; settles to an average constant layer leaving some tight lacing.  Very intriguing nose for a dark Belgain with some floral notes, even some herbal notes, some darker malt notes, even a little vinous;  other notes of dough, light banana, and raisin.  Tastes more like a trappist than the nose led on with very rich malt flavors and typical yeasty notes, Belgian chocolate, rich caramel, hints of chicory, brown sugar, prune, light banana, mild hints of the floral towards the end keeping the beer from becoming cloyingly rich.  Palate is just more than medium, but somewhat round, making it seem much fuller, and lively; I didnt like the palate at first becasue of the lighter body and amount of carbonation, but it grows on you.  I was trying to compare it to other trappist palates, and that would just decrease the character of the beer, this one is too different from the others to be categorized the same way.  Finishes fairly long and mostly sweet with brown sugar, prune, and doughy yeast and the dryness becoming more apparent as well as a nice warming effect.  A good amount of alcohol warmth from the 9% but that only accentuates the beer.  Not at all what I was expecting from a trappist, but I was pleasantly surprised after having a few sips.  Not overly complex for a top level trappist, but quite refreshing as compared to others.  This one is much more subtle with the flavors and has many notes that I wasnt expecting from a trappist.  The more I drink the more I like it.  Very well put together and the delicacy of beer makes for something incredibly memorable.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

The aroma reminds me of fresh baked bread, im guessing because of the yeast, when the beer becomes closer to room temperature notes of cinnamon, caramel, and marzipan emerge. The flavor has remnants of caramel at the beginning, which gives way to a bread like flavor, rather interesting flavors, I taste some bruised banana somewhere in their aswel, when the beer becomes closer to room temperature sweet flavours of bruised fruit, plums, raisins, and marzipan come through, very complex.

I dont know, but if you talk to long time drinkers of Chimay, they say that it has lost some of its quality over the years.  probably the most ""commercial"" trappist.  always a good drink, and you have to scrutinize the trappists because they all are very good, and are held at a different level.","Asheville, North Carolina, USA","Jmichael"

Im going to buy a case and age it, give it a try and see how it works. A very complex flavour that I dont have the experience to describe. Its an easy beer to drink, like the Chimay Rouge, but at the same time its an easy beer to drink far too much of. The alcohol content is noticeable, but light  enough that its not overbearing.

Color is a nice a warm brown nutty color, but the beer being unpasteurized/unfiltered and bottle conditioned is pretty cloudy.

The light floral quality from the Rouge is much more obvious with the Bleue.  Id agree with others that this beer could benefit from a few years of aging.  As it gets warmer, it gets a little bit too sharp. Its certainly not an everyday drinker like the Rouge could be, but its much more complex, and much more of a treat, like a dark chocolate would compare to a chocolate bar.

Unknown Vintage (very old label though)
6/26/2009:  Chimay Blue has an amazing aroma containing caramelized malts, rich dried fruits (dates, figs, plum, raisin), chocolate, sugary Tootsie Roll, well-aged port, and brown sugar.  The hint of oxidation really does wonders for the aroma.  It has a blunt, dark brown color.  There isnt much carbonation left as only a thin beige heads forms after the pour and promptly disappears.  There is some fine sediment suspended within the liquied as well.  The flavor doesnt quite deliver what the aroma suggested.  It is plenty sweet and malty with lots of brown sugar, caramelized malt, hints of dried fruits (dates, raisins), and cola, but the depth and complexity has been obscured by quite a bit of cardboard oxidation at this point.  This also causes the beer to feel thin and limp in the mouth.  That not withstanding, Chimay Blue is a fantastic beer and never disappoints!

When I first tried it, I did not know what to think, but understood immediately that this was a quality beer. The taste was a little too strong and the alcohol was overwhelming. However, when returning to America I picked up the 75cl bottle and drank it at a punk show. Not only did I feel more dignified, but in contrast to all the malt liquor in the room, I finally grasped the full goodness of this beer. The taste was rich, sweet and creamy. Every sip of the beer was excellent and when the bottle was finished, I regretted that I had to begin drinking a lower quality beer and lamented nostalgically on the excellent beer consumed.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

BIG - no HUGE  fruity aroma that yields to a slight malt ending. You would think such a powerful and vibrant whiff of fruit would be overbearing, but it lingers only momentarily and is balanced perfectly by the malt ending. A feast for your nostrils! I know thats a lot of words to waste on a simple smell - but this beer really smells great. On to the taste: Almost no bitterness, with mostly fruit and malty overtones. Very sweet and sugary. Thicker then your average beer, but the body isnt quite full enough for me.

Crisp flavours with a sweetish mouthfeel. Finishes dry in the mouth from hop bitterness. This is not a bitter beer, but the finish is still surprisingly dry. Obvious Chimay yeast character that I recognize from my own homebrewed beers using the same yeast. I find the beer to be disappointing, and not very interesting.

Roasty and alcoholic (though not offensively so) and very vinous at first, full of prunes and dates with a hint of tartness and some oak.

Aroma: Fruity with apples, pears, and banana with caramel malts.  Very sweet.  Some alcohol in the nose.
Appearance: Very pretty deep mahagony color with a fantastic, sustaining head of large and medium bubbles that laced nicely.
Flavor: Starts sweet and malty.  Full bodied.  Ending slightly bitter and spicy but balanced so very pleasant.
Palate: Slightly bitter and dry makes the mouth tingle pleasantly.

The fruitiness comes through in the flavor though it seems you have to work a little harder to get at it than other Belgian ales. Sweet plums, breads, malts. The ending is spicy with peppery alochol. Medium body with a short to moderate, sticky finish.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"

Pours a beatifull mahoganny color with some red hues and a nice bubblybeige head that leaves some lacings. Aroma is fruity, plums, raisins, dried fruits maybe some green apple and a hint of alcohol. Taste is rather sweet, medium to full mouthfeel, swift carbonatation. Tastes of caramel,  port, vanillas, leaves a winey aftertaste. Not so complex and maybe even a little unidimnetional, taste doesn´t stands up to the aroma. Drinkability is amazing for a 9% brew.","Santiago, CHILE","Fukito"

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly sticky with foamy carbonation that stings a bit more than a typical Belgian, perhaps it’s just the fresh alcohol. Enjoyable, but not terribly impressed considering my impression of previous bottles. It has been at least a year since my last bottle of Blue, and while I remember it being considerably more tasty,  I think it is more likely that my perception of taste has evolved.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","TheBeerOrg"

Not quite as deep as some other belgians but very tasty! Yeasty and musky flavors come through in a nice way. Good dark fruity flavors are present. To me it also has a little bit of a chocolate milk, or maybe a cocoa flavor in there, too. Massive rocky head that you would expect from a belgian. Lacing is beautiful - like a well woven spider-web down my entire glass. I always buy this one thinking that I only need one because of its ABV, but always wish I would have bought two. Drink it warm-ish like you would most Belgians of this style, but dont let it get too warm, the alcohol becomes more present in both the nose and the flavor.","Wheat Ridge, Colorado, USA","MrEcted1"

I definitely let some of the yeast on the bottom sneak in, but it still formed a decent thin head and looks like it has some serious substance.  The aroma is very winey.  Reminds me in particular of rieslings and other fruity whites.  I also pick up a bit of apple cider.  In the mouth theres some serious viscosI ity but rather than being sticky, this beer is slippery.  Strange, but not unpleasant at all, with good CO2 levels.  The flavors are a little harder for me to appreciate.  Admitedly, Belgians are not my favorite in general, so many strong sour flavors overload my tongue, but Im trying my best to be descriptive and positive rather than critical.  Definitely very strong grape flavors, incredibly winey.  Though it is dry in general, Id say theres a good deal of malt, with some roasty and smokey flavors shining through in an interesting way.  The alcohol definitely also makes itself known in the flavor.  Also, again, a bit of that apple cidery taste.  Perhaps Ive yet to have a good bottle of a Belgian, or maybe they are just too sour for me.

Thick, long lasting head of large bubbles bring the yeasty, apricot tinged vapors to the nose. The first hints of sourness are here, like fruit ripening on the tree. 

The palate is even, not overly strong in any one characteristic. The malty characteristics are balanced by the sourness and both conspire to hide the heavy alcohol content. No hint of the 9+% alcohol until you realize that it is rocking your face off. 

The sourness of the after-palate is a bit offsetting at first, but blends quickly until it is the taste you anticipate with your next sip.","Minneola, Florida, USA","cchubb"

2312,"2006-03-14",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2008 Rating Nº 100  Edition 2005 - drunk March, 2006:
Pours a slightly hazy brown color with orange and copper undertones. Shows a huge creamy and rocky head that lasts for long and leaves a precious lacing.
Aroma is wonderfully rich, malty and yeasty in character. It has strong notes of nuts, dark chocolate, caramel and fruits like plums, prunes and a little of clove and Lapsang Souchong dark tea. I found also some touches of alcohol and toffee.
Flavor is very powerful with a blur of sweetness but bittersweet coffee-ish in character. There are hints of almonds, walnuts, caramel and red wine with some spicy layers. Complex yet incredibly smooth. 
The mouthfeel is thick and pleasant. It feels winy or maybe liquorish with an oily texture. Marvelous finish, eternal and full of boldness. In addition, the alcohol is masterfully disguised. Let it warm a bit and it will become a real gem.
Awesome.
Edition 2006 - drunk November 20 same year: Pretty much the same as above but a little less complex. I noticed the yeast was still working pretty hard in the bottle. Im sure this one must be aged a couple of years to truly shine. However it was still a wonderful beer. 8/4/8/4/16 Score: 4.0

Edition 2005 - drunk August 2008: Now I know the hype was right. A properly aged, 3 years Chimay Bleue is an Elixir of the Gods. Loads of chestnuts, walnuts and caramel are the new impressions in the nose. Some rum or brandy-like alcoholic notes too, and everything gets rounded with a strong sherry character. In the flavor, more nutty hints, figs and brown sugar with the touch of sherry again. This beer was a jewel. Fantastic. 10/4/9/5/17: Score 4.5","Hanga Roa, Easter Island, CHILE","Panzerfaust"

1999 Vintage (e5.0 @ Kulminator Oct 2006) 
Ok, 7yr old trappiest for A$9, er WTF is going on? (translation - bloody bargain!!). Creamy coffee coloured head shows truckloads of dense lacing. Excellent. Very dark brown in colour. Soft nose of old malts and cooked rhubarb (a nice trait!). Palate is all about balance and subtlety. Soft chocolate and malts; oh so approachable with nil apparent alcohol heat. Tails off a touch on the finish but how can you fault given the age? (3.9pts)
2005 Vintage (consumed 2005)
Cant believe its taken me this long to rate this grand daddy. Decent head on pouring but thins out quickly. Nice reddish-brown in colour. Well balanced nose of sweet, earthy malts and a hint of stewed fruits. Quite elegant. Palate continues the elegant theme but to my mind to a fault. Controlled malts early in the piece with nice liquored chocolate notes but the flavour profile really takes a hit with some noticeable fizz drying the palate out.

2312,"2006-01-31",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2006 This is, of course, a classic beer, and it is not famous, like, say, Bud or Heineken, because of some advertising campagne.  I will go so far as to say that it is the best beer in Belgium or Northern France, and this says something very good about the business in general: when the best beers are the most popular, there is something that is right in the world.  Now to the rewiew:  This pours a dark, almost black tint, that is accented by a plumb rouge and a bit of a purple tinge around the edges of the glass.  The carbonation rolls to the top of the glass like German tanks crashing over the Maginot line.  The mouthfeel is silky smoothe, but this fills out in the process of the sip to form a generous, fluffy texture.  The taste is lightly of chocolate and strongly of plumbs.  This balance is crucial --the malts are providing the flavor in this beer and that can sometimes be bad news, leaving only yeast or bread to the executive judgement of the palate.  However, the light fruitiness, here, cleans up the sometimes sticky malts and transforms the breadiness at the base of the flavor into a strong, lightly acidic, moderately sweet, strongly textured alcoholic delight that can only be aluded to.  The only catch is that youd better not be expecting any genuine hops when you pick up the glass.  All of this is a definitely good thing: Chimay is uniquely at the top of the enormous pile of Belgian beers.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","KarmanGhia"

Extremely muddy with the yeast dispersing into a pulped fruit mess inside the cola brown body with an enormous, creamy beige crown raising up and persisting for the length to trail fine lacing down the glass. Heady aroma, quite woody almost oak-aged with fresh pulped zesty plums, red wine dryness, spicy yeast and an underlying earthy mustiness like old hops. Lovely smooth and almost creamy mouthfeel; vinous notes set it off and develop into an earthy woody mix of malt and hops. Plums and blueberries, driftwood, peppery alcohol and yeast phenols and a hint of pecan pie develop to linger long in the mouth hiding that 9% ABV. Warming and homely, this example seemed more woody than most that I have tried with a long finish that was like a well aged plum wine. Seemed to have more age than the 2001. Quite nice. (75cL, Nookenburra) 
2001- Poured into its own chalice at cellar temperature. Quite clear, deep ruby red with a tinge of brown. Head formed off the pour; extremely dense and creamy beige, held in place by streams of very, very fine bubbles to leave a mist over the glass as I drank. Pungent and tart, port-like nose with an immense spicy waft of alcohol and the famous house yeast. Other dried fruits were there with a lick of bitter/sweet chocolate and a touch of polished Jarrah (?). Extremely wine-like in the mouth; mellowing, smooth and yet prickly across the tongue with a good dose of medicinal alcohol that didnt hinder it at all. Blackcurrants, raisins and those distinctive plum notes abound, this was like an after dinner elixir to stir up the rawest of emotion, by the fire with a loved one perhaps. Finish is as smooth as silk letting the alcohol warm to its full extent along with a deeply vinous  roundness and depth. I love a good strong ale, and Chimay delivers with fervour. (75cL, Vintage Cellars, Adelaide)
 As I said who could go past a Chimay!","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"
2312,"2006-01-27",4.8,"Chimay Grand Reserve pours to a beautiful, deep garnet color with a thick, rocky white head, and a very vibrant carbonation. The nose is filled with complex aromas. Aromas of spicy/musty yeast, marry with fruity estery aromas of plum, candy sugar, sweet malt, peppery alcohol, and herby hop character. The palate is firm, with big sweet and dark malt flavors paired with flavors of rock candy, fruity esters, and a back drop of spicy yeastiness. This beer finishes with more of those complex flavors up front, then ends with a warming, peppery alcoholic burn. 

 Some age in the cellar has taken those raw, young aromas and flavors of a young bottle, and make them more complex and deep. The aromas are more yeasty and spicy in nature, with a bit more malt and alcohol aroma, and a more rounded estery fruit note. The plummy notes will  become more vinous and port like.  A few years of age will  make a phenomenal beer even more complex, and delicious. 

This is a world class Trappist ale, and one of the most accessible of all the Trappist ales. It should be available in most US markets. Chimay has done more than any Trappist brewery to make beer lovers aware of these very special beer styles. This beer is the perfect match for strong blue veined cheeses, cured or smoked meats and fish. It also makes a wonderful after dinner drink, and a warming winter brew. Remember you can consume this beer either young or old, I have enjoyed it both ways.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

2312,"2006-01-24",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 5, 2008 While I must say spending $5.00 for a single bottle of beer is not something I do with regularity, I did so because of the fact this beer was Top 5 on many lists and its the only one on the list I had access to. So I headed up to BevMo with my best friend (who got a ticket on the way there HAH!), plunked down my money, took it home let it stay nice and cool in the garage overnight and opened it the next day. A HUGE head, Im talking seriously HUGE. A wonderful aroma of raisins, dates, plums and a spiciness. The taste had a nice roastiness flavor, with nutmeg and a peppery flavor. It had some teeth on it with a 9% ABV, so you could taste that also, which put me off a bit (reminded me of this really crappy French beer I once had). While this was an excellent dark ale, I would not say it belongs in the Top 5 on these lists.

Hmm, my first trappist and Im a bit underwhelmed.  Maybe my palate isnt as experienced or sophisticated, seeing as how Im 22, but this beer is a bit overrated in my opinion.  Very yeasty smell, but a good one, and probably the best feature of this beer.  Fizzy as all get out, like a champagne, the mouthfeel is medium with a warm, numbing alcohol sensation.  The flavor is caramelly sweet with a spicy background which becomes stronger as you swallow it.  A spicy, almost peppery aftertaste follows.  Not bad, but not something I would try again.","Platteville, Wisconsin, USA","cperry8483"

Sweet, like cinnamon apples but wonderfully malty as well. Finishes pretty dry, but with a little bit of alcohol, hop, and malt. Mouth feel is nice and thick.

And that paragon of centered flavor and palate is the Chimay Blue.  What a beautiful beer; beautiful in its precarious balance.  The color is like a light baby bears fur, and the foam a casual light tan color.  The whole appearance is gentle and soft, picturesque to anybody with a disposition to tactile experience.  The smell is extraordinarily complex, fuming with copious yeast and some teriyaki sauce.  I must say, the aroma is quite mild, not unlike the taste.  The flavor is just light enough to match perfectly with the palate.  The whole flavor compound lingers on the tongue for a long time, allowing the drinker to take his time and really immerse himself in the Chimay Blue experience.

2312,"2005-10-16",4.0,"OK, I know Chimay has a reputation, kind of like being the best car made in the 50s, but it really is out-of-date isnt it?

It cant compare really to the beers made by Omnibroue, unless you are making a special category for vintage-era beers. Sure, it might have been the best there was 20 years ago, but we have made progress and these old style beers taste, well, out-of-date.

It is fine and agreeable, but has none of the complexity of a Trois Pistoles or Three Philosophers.

It tastes like a really good sparkling champagne-style beer, bubbly and effervescent, but not very substantial.

The aroma is very yeasty/doughy with some sweet odors and a bit of apple and citrus (lime/lemon). The head was fairly small and died off quickly - leaving a somewhat unattractive brown foam. While this was a bit disappointing, the overall appearance was very nice - like deep reddish brown shoe leather. At first I found the carbonation to be overly strong for my taste buds, but found this beer improved greatly after sitting in the glass for about ten minutes. Taste is fairly alcoholic and creamy.

Nice plummy fruitiness giving way to a fine underlying lemony sourness forming in the middle a taste reminiscent of forest fruits, like forest strawberry. Id probably say it tasted like port with a sourish background, but Ive never tasted port so I wouldnt know (duh), and the best I can explain it as prosecco-but-not-as-sweet-with-a-sour-background. So there you go. Ah, right, aftertaste. Not much hops present, but they arent really needed here.

Then it is all rounded off with and very long and amazing caramel and marzipan finish with some gradual alcohol warming. Glorious stuff.

Fairly acidic on the tongue with a lasting peppery finish.  Maybe not the best Trappiste but very accessible.

I really love that. The beer itself isnt as good as people rate it. There is some complexity. I taste the malt, I detect the ""flowery aroma"", but you know....it really isnt in the same ballpark as the westy 8 or any rochefort stuff. It is FAR from a bad beer, but it doesnt deserve to be in the 99 percentile. Keep in mind that such beers as aventinus,stone IPA, and many other excellent beers  are in the 99 percentile or less category.

This beer has been kicking around my folks place for ages, I finally conned them into opening it. I knew that it would be past its best but its still an impressive drop. No head and totally flat it poured like a glass of port (not dissimmilar in aroma too). The complexity of the nose is amazing. Herbal almost medicinal in character, raisins soaked in brandy. The hue is from watery to caramel. Flavour is malt and alcohol driven. Alcohol bitterness is balanced on the finish by malt sweetness no hop bitterness at all. A nice clean dry finish. I prefer a younger example but none the less imperssive.","AUSTRALIA","timdom"

Very full-bodied with a warming but never cloying alcohol - actually, it doesnt really appear that strong. Chocolatey and spicy - perhaps even a bit peppery?

The aroma is a bit subdued for an in-bottle fermentation, but the taste and mouthfeel are so rounded and silky that theyre hard to surpass.  The 9% content is scarcely noticeable but necessary to add a bit of pleasant astringency to what would otherwise be a very heavy ale.  Very floral notes to both the aroma and the flavour.

One to try again defo.

Rating for a second time: Got a magnium and cellered for 3 months. OMG this takes things to a whole new level probabl;y the best beer iv ever ever tasted. 100% goodness alround. so fruity and juicey and refreshing and just amazing. 

I regularly get chimay as its one of the best beers we can get is scotland, however while at the kulminator, i got a 1985 bottle, as that was the year i was born on. This again reinforces my high rating as this beer is just alround goodness, its always going to be a safe bet and u can drink about 10 of them which cant be said for other belgiun strong fellows. 

RERATE: Had one last night as a finisher offer, 2007 bottle thats been settlign in my room for a good few months, served at perfect cellar temp. Bottle opens and as iv found with recent bottle gushes everywhere, thankfully glass at hand, however all of the sediment is now stirred up and pours an ugly brown with many floating particals. Aroma is fruity, inky character, sweet with alc present. Taste isnt very plesnt at all, fruity, yeasty, ink again, grainy, aghh not for the first time in 6 months iv decided this beer is no longer hot in any way, older aged vertions, yea unbeatable on thier day but this chap has offically lost it!","bantervile, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","DonMagi"

Yep. What a glass and 2/3 (I finished my wifes too) of this stuff did to my digestive track was UNBELIEVABLE. I have to guess it was the yeast.

Anyway -- overall impression is cut in half because of the toxicity of whatever it was that gave me such godawful cramps and the ensuing ejectiva that went on until Sunday at Noon. (I drank it on a Friday night).

It turned out to be just what I had guessed it would be... a pretty nice beer that has become overrated because it is now so mass produced.  Pours a nice dark plum color with hints of ruby.  Small particles float for a bit and sink to the bottom.  Big head, but not creamy and not very long lasting.  Nose is sweet, tart and sour with a great nose of Belgian yeast.  Taste is nice... a little yeast, a little maltiness, but a little too dry for my tastes.  It certainly is a good solid beer, but not even up to par with some American Belgian Ales.  Not much body and a good solid medium carbonation that fits the style well.  Well above average, but not an unbelievable beer.","Sligo","pjk33"

Its really good,  perhaps a little too much carbonation for its type.  As good as it is, some places charge way too much for it.  Buyer beware.  Some places think they can charge anything for a chimay- which is because some idiots will pay anything for a reputable brew.

However, I found that the first time there seemed to be much more aroma - I think this time the aroma seemd trapped under the generous lasting head I poured. Anyway... What a drop - such a multitude of flavours throughout the whole sipping and swallowing process. Starts off with a rich fruity, malty and typical ale fruitiness intensity - so many different flavours come out. Followed by a wallowing progression of the hops transgression. The hops blend (I assume more than one type is used) is blended excellently, and so smoothly mixed with the malts used. Then lastly, the aftertaste, which comprises of sweet maltiness, and not overly bitter hoppiness, presented in a package which itself gives off some metallicness, astringence and bitterenss. This beer is so complex in flavour, yet so well balanced.  Incredible. Give me the recipe! Or, more importantly, give me another! The best beer I have ever tasted.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","Mullo"

I bet this ages great!","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

2312,"2005-02-04",4.1,"Pours the most opaque dark brown color Ive ever seen.  A weak head, dissipates quickly.  Smells like malti-/yeastiness.  Like if you were baking bread.

The taste is malty and a little bit fruity, with a lot of bubbliness on the finish, appropriate for a beer in a champagne bottle, I suppose.  Theres no overpowering bitterness or sourness, but plenty of flavor and mouthfeel to satisfy even the guys in the 100 beer raters club .  Just a tad of spiciness on the aftertaste, this is a wonderful beer from the second you uncork the bottle until the minute youre crying in the closet because its gone.

Makes you understand why so many American craft brewers go out of their way to imitate Belgian abbey-made beers.  Really wonderful, if slightly overcarbonated for my tastes.  At $8 for a 750mL, this is a great, great beer for a special occasion, or to impress a lady friend.","High Bridge, New Jersey, USA","AdamSkillin"

The fruity, spicy, chocolaty aroma accentuated the malty nature of the brew. The taste was warming and mellow with the very sweet fruity malt chasing the dusty yeast and powered cocoa into the background. It was not as complex as other Trappist ales, but was quite satisfying in its own way. Full bodied and sticky, with a lingering spicy dry aftertaste, and just a touch of grassy hops.

Sweet and spicy aroma with loads of plummy fruit, dark molasses, and faint cherry fruitiness in the nose.  The flavour is quite spicy, reminding me of a subdued version of the Unibroue yeast.  Yeasty notes mingle nicely with brown sugar, toast, molasses and dried plums and cherries.  Full-bodied beer as well.  There is quite a bit more bitterness in this bottle than I expected, although I suspect that as it ages this will diminish.

Lots of softness in the aroma, palate and head, and a flavor profile which while it doesnt rip off my taste buds is pleasant, lingering and complex. Not good at flavor descriptions but possible dried fruits, malt is sweet. Aroma persists like decent wine. Soft fluffy head like an angels pillow. Fine carbonation adds to impression of softness. No grandstanding, just all simple class. Quite comforting and more-ish, highly drinkable.

It poured to give a nice off-white head that lasted fairly long despite the high alcohol content.  Unfortunately in Australia beers tend to be served extremely chilled, after letting it warm up a little the alcohol was still powerful and a bit harsh.

Dark Brown.

Nearly non-existant aroma. Faint, but the slightest faint of brown sugar, plums and raisins.

Absolutely disgusting. Alcohol is very prominent. The mellow dark fruit flavors are hidden by the candy sugar and must ""dirt like"" overtones.

2312,"2004-09-16",3.0,"UPDATED: DEC 22, 2014  May, 2002:  1 year old bottle. Nestles milk with melon juice and a dash of port in a sodastream bottle. Intensely sweet with the warm impact of a high alcohol content. Very rough fizz-bomb. [2.7]
 Nov, 2002:  18 month old bottle.  At room temperature it displays its best features, but unfortunately also its worst. Slightly chilled the buzz and the alcohol are reduced so the beer becomes more harmonised, but then it just becomes a muddy sludge. [2.9]
 Sept, 2004:  Murky reddish brown appearance that only a mother could love. Pleasant Belgian aroma - spicy dough and nougart. Mouthfeel is difficult - theres a pleasant creamy carbonation which melts and fades, leaving a pleasant tingle. Hmm. I think I like that mouthfeel. I would like a bit more firmness. And Im not a fan of carbonation - but this is interestingly tingly. Its a pleasant tasting beer, and the flavours are more harmonised, pronounced and balanced when the beer is at a cool rather than cold temperature. But even when the flavours are displayed at their best they are muddled and murky with a number of off flavours like plastic and parsnips along with the licorice and chocolate notes. The balance between sweet and bitter is interesting - mostly sweet, and sometimes intensely so, there are moments of assertive bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is noticeable - but its warming and gentle. I enjoyed drinking this - there is an attractiveness about this beer despite the flaws. [3.2]
March, 2005: Two year old bottle. Initially very sweet. The mouthfeel is loose - the carbonation is so fine that it never gets a grip. At this point its all about a candy sweetness and some vanilla yeast. Pleasant, but sort of babyish. When carbonation has burnt off, there are bitter notes more apparent. The bitterness is certainly more obvious at colder temperatures. There are nice flavours here (chocolate, coconut, licorice, alcohol, caramel), but there is a lack of integrity, lack of balance, lack of finesse which prevents this from being totally enjoyable. [3.1]
Nov, 2007 Compared with Brakspears Triple this doesnt hold up at all. The Triple is tasty, subtle, complex and interesting. This is simply murky, muddled, candy sweet and fizzy with an ugly alcohol presence. None of that is to say that I dislike the beer, but that its not my first choice off the shelf, and drinking it is not the pleasurable experience youd hope for. Some Band Aid, something numbing, and something odd. You gotta love the character of the beer - it certainly is a talking point. But it doesnt add up to much in the final analysis. [2.9] 
May, 2011 Each time I try this the story is the same. Its pleasant in parts, but has its weaknesses, and overall doesnt impress as a quality product. I mean, its drinkable stuff, and its OK, but its not a beer I want to rush back to. The alcohol is too obvious, the carbonation is all over the place, it burns a bit, its too yeasty and chalky, and the flavours dont meld or balance each other- theyre there, but theres no harmony. You can get good flavours out of it, but theyre not impressive flavours - theyre just decaying fruit, spice, sugar, musk etc - something different each time. Flavours yes, but most stuff has flavours. Its how the flavours meld and impress and delight that matters. I dont know which I prefer - red or blue.... [3.0]Dec, 2014 330ml dark bottle from Casino, Marseilles. Foamy, chalky, buzzy, malty, muddy, messy. Sweet yeasty caramel.

2312,"2004-07-03",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 8, 2005 7/3/04 Rating: 3.1.  Big bottle into Chimay Trappist glass.  Disappointment.  Tasted like the bastard stepchild of De Dolle Oerbier Special Reserva after a severe punishment and no supper.  Comes from a good family, mind you, and the foster parents mean well, but they can only do so much with what theyve been given.  Considering the high ratings this got a few years ago, Im guessing its going downhill.  Shame.  Poured brown-orange and darkish, beige head large to fully diminishing, fizzy.  Not much lacing at all.  Smelled citrusy and yeasty, maybe a bit of honeydew melon in there.  Tasted vaguely like an orange peel, somewhat smoky, alcohol, malt.  Not much of a finish.  Fizzy, medium bodied mouthfeel was kind of unpleasant.  6/3/05 Re-Rate: 3.7.  (2003 Bottle, 750 ml into tulip glass).  Uncorked quickly, lots of pressure.  Yeast, bread, banana, lemon, some skunk and black pepper on the nose.  Huge fizzy fluffy grayish-beige head, rocky, with a latice of sticky lace.  Clear ruby brown in the light, darkly transluscent in the glass.  Medium body, prickly carbonation, low to medium acidity gets stronger through the finish.  Caramel and chocolate malts with a tad bit of roast, slight malted milk ball flavor and lots of musty white bread toast in the middle.  Some nuttiness in the beginning of the finish.  Some tangy mealiness in the beginning of the finish detracts, but the banana flavors in the finish are awesome.  Overall, despite all the complexity, I found the flavor profile to be kind of weak in intensity and the feel to be watery for how big the beer is, especially since I could notice the alcohol in the mouthfeel.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

2312,"2004-06-29",3.7,"""Pop!"" goes the top, the resounding sound of corks release a tease of what lies in store.
Color, a ruddy brown, tawny and opaque.
Head is off-white, fuzzy and activley bubbly.
Aroma: playing it quiet, actually spare, arid, Im getting nothing at all! Light echoes of nuts and toffee, wafts of maltiness. Not too happy with this aspect.
On first sip, a big blast of hops, with malt following immediately on its heels. We find that this is a brew that must be allowed time to open up, give it a little time and space...shows off earthy, nutty, chocolatey flavors, with a generous amount of zippy, zingy spark on the palate. Taste becomes better, richer, more complex and fruity. Excellent effervescence, featuring that special Belgian spark and yeasty taste. Smooth, though before long the alcoholic component kicks in and rides tall in the saddle.
Ive neglected Chimay for quite some time, perhaps after encountering Ommegang, a better tasting ale, in my opinion, when fresh, and at 1/2 the price. Perhaps Ive got to try this cellaring business to see what an older sample might offer up to us.
On this tasting, a pretty nice drink, but didnt blow me away.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

Though this was better than the last one it was still just alright.  It was as carbonated as a Coke.  It tasted pretty much like a Paulaner but a little more alcohol like.  $5 a 11 oz bottle was a rip, too.

May 2005 rating...it just gets worse.

Oh how the mighty have fallen.  Disappointed is the best word to use here.  Tim Webb reported the demise of this once fine ale in his beer guide last year, but I wasnt convinced till this taste.  To look at it youd never know things had gone so bad.  Taking a taste removes all doubt.  I think Mr. Webbs quote ""...overtones of damp cardboard..."" says it all.  What complexity that was there before is all but gone.  I lived in The Netherlands for three years and grew to love this jewel.  All I can say is that the bottled stuff available in the US now is NOT worth the money---not even close.  I remember this used to compare very well with Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren Abt.  Those fine brews blow this one to smithereens.  Im sure its no coincidence that Chimays demise occurred just after they were bought out.  I love Belgian ales, but you should stay clear of this one until they figure out how to get their old swagger back.

A friend offered this up tonight.....it stinks just as bad in 2009.  It actually might be worse.....simply awful.....the brewery thats belching this crap out needs to be hit by a few Tomahawk missiles.......blow it to oblivion.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"

Is it no longer being matured for long enough by the brewery or is malt extract being used? Something is missing that I cant put my finger on, but to me, this is now a very simple beer. Tried it next to a Rochefort 10, which might be why Im so jaded, but it used to and should still stand this comparison. It doesnt.","Zillebeke, BELGIUM","Hugh"

Poured a dark slightly clouded amber with a smallish off white cap. Aromas of dates or figs or dried apricots. Started with a surprising big mouthful of sweet bready malts before the expected complex/layered banana-fig-hop undertones took over. As the beer sits on the palate the hop accent builds until the finish is surprisingly dry for a so called trappist ale.

A very delightful strong ale but this is the 3rd time Ive tasted it and it has appeared slightly different each time. This may be a matter of ingredient linearity or it could be the brewers equivilent to a ""vintage"" where there is some batch to batch character differences.

The dominant flavor though is a sweet malt, with some dry spices (cloves and nutmeg).  The finish is short and smooth, with a little linger of the spice.

The aroma is fruity, dried dark fruits and apricots, somewhat milky (skim milk smell).  The first taste is a shock of carbonation, too much for me.  Reminds me more of a Salvator than a fine Belgian, not that I don't like Salvator.  The flavor is so lightly roasted as to be quite subtle, almost like a good brown ale.  Fruits dominate, along with floral yeasties and mild but bitter-sweet molasses.  Palate is most pleasing once I get used to the fizzy carbonation, but it seems somehow out of place for a strong-style beer.

She doesn't like beer, usually, but since we rarely see each other she went with me to the event and actually tasted many of the beers I sampled. This one she actually liked. So I bought a bottle knowing she was coming down for the weekend and thought she might want to have some. Well, she had a sip but still didn't want to drink a beer. < sigh > Oh well, I tried.

I really don't have a ton of experience with Belgians, in full disclosure, but *damn* this is good. It's very close to the Trois Pistole (sp?) from Unibrou, but I prefer this one.

Oh, I'm not using the ""correct"" glass for the beer yet again.

Pours a rather dark brown with a suprisingly white head and very little lacing. The first pour I was cautious because of the many overflows I've had with Belgians, and that left very little head. The second pour I was more vigerous, but still not too much head or any lacing.

Smells very fruity, as in raisins, apples. The scent is inviting.

Taste surely doesn't let you down. The fruits I mentioned are there as well as a few others like banana. It's spicy as well; cloves are present.

Mouthfeel is full and spicy. Drinkability suffers only from the high alcohol content, but I'll definately have more of these.

This is complex. I want to grab a few more of these while they're still on sale and put them away for awhile, so maybe I'll be able to revisit it in a year or so. However, you definately owe it to yourself to try this beer.","Port Orchard, Washington, USA","Gromit"

Purchased fresh in September 2001 from Total Beverage for $10.99 each. Poured out a deep dark clear brown color. The cork shot out of the bottle when opened. Very effervescent carbonation, champagne like in every way. Subdued cream colored head that left more than a decent lacing in my Chimay chalice. Aromas are of fresh grape wine, slight malts, and rum soaked dried fruits. Figs, plums, and dates come to mind. Very aromatic, and very delicious.
Tastes are of dried, dark, rum soaked fruits, vinous, and oaky as well. Hops make a brief appearance in the middle, only to be overtaken by the rich, creamy malts. Very rich mouthfeel, thick, but not chewy. Rich, flavorful, and complex flavors and aromas describe this beer best. Finishes rich, creamy, and very filling.
The good monks certainly did their homework on this beer.

Both bottles had heads that slowly began slowly creeping out of the bottles although they were treated very gently. Both have great malty flavours with a hint of roastiness, mocha, plums and a strong alcohol flavour which improves the feel of the beer. 1998 beer was smoother. Both are higher carbonated that I would have thought (and at the same level) but it doesn't detract. They drink with heaps of mouthfeel!","Taylors Hill, AUSTRALIA","Choos"

The aroma is heavily floral, bitter with spice and alcohol. Good carbonation with a medium to full body, the taste of pepper and plums overpowers the tongue and then lays there like a wet rug. I was hoping the alcohol would clean it up, but an acidic taste lingered even after the beer was finished.

Lovely soft malt flavour with some toast/biscuit notes and some alcohol. Very round and soft, yet carrying very big flavours. Just when I was thinking I didnt like this any more I have a bottle that really kicks arse. Perhaps its just the difference between the big and small bottles...Aged four years: I had a 2000 magnum last night (March 2004) which was brilliant. The beer had thinned somewhat and mellowed but the aroma had taken on a brilliant, slightly sour, cherry-type aroma very reminiscent of a Flemish sour ale. Seemed quite oaky too. Really good - subtle and complex flavour. I went back and bought the other bottle to store for a while. I would rate this a 4.4 or 4.5.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

Guests were handed bottles of Sam Addams and Pete's somethin'-or-other and then this wonderful man who I hadn't sen in 7 years brings out a bottle of Chimay!!!!!!
Glorio day! Of course noone else in the place could appreciate the earthy and subtle complexities of JUST the aroma of this beer. ""Hey, man. That's Skunked!"" Fools. DE-licious. Dark and sweet, earthy and fruity. A fine balance between the hops and malt. Truly a fine end to a wonderful night.

Something similar to the Gouden Caroluses, but more balanced and less anise-pronounced. Reasonably full body, sweetish, rye-puddingy. Vinous, even slightly alcoholic when young. Quite strongly hoppy finish. Smooth and sticky, but not too sugary. Very well-balanced, although somewhat foamy-carbonated. A very nice trappist, still worth every point.

Its spicy, the alcohol is not very noticeable, its really nice to look at.  Its got one of the best, tightest heads Ive seen on a brew.  Aroma is somewhat lacking, but its got a really good flavor.  Its not too yeasty, and its not too sweet.  Really, I may be underrating this one.

This ale essentially is dry from start to finish, with a nicely balanced alcohol taste.  I enjoyed it immensely.  Theres a hint of sweetness up front, and its complex aroma hints of bready yeast, clove and, perhaps, anise.  It is complex, well-balancedeven delicate.  The initial palate is lemon, clove, anise and roasted malt.  This is a high ABV ale, but it is smooth and it does overwhelm the senses.  Truly, a classic by any standard.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ivan9856"

Nose is of yeast, bread, subtle clove and anise.  complex, yet very delicate.  The color is a deep brown/red.

First taste gives hints of lemon, clove, anise and malt, but in such a complete, harmonious blend it's hard to tell one influence from another.  It's a fairly big ale, but isn't overly alcoholic.

Nose is dull and kinda light, not much going on besides some light lemon peel citrus and yeast, a touch smokey and meaty upon bigger wiffs. 

Taste is short lived and a bit boring, complexity is not very forthcoming from this offering. Very dull citrus of melon husk and majorly dulled lemon and peels, lightly sweet malts and subdued spicy yeast with some strange uneven texture that I didn't care for all that much. 

Feel is medium bodied with a weird texture I just couldn't get past. Where's the smooth? Where's the creamy? Blah, boring, yuk. Not impressed. The Chimay Red was much better. I'm not sure if I have a bad bottle or what, but I've been saving this bottle, plus a few others for nearly 4 months hoping a bit of aging would make for an interesting session, but nope.

Mouthfull of flavor, more raisins, more port, more yeast, combining with violets, a bit of roastiness, and something ephemeral I can only find in a chalice of Chimay.

(still, this little 12 ounce bottle cost me five fat american buckeroos-- so, at that price i oughta get huge aroma, free HBO for a month and a couple discount coupons toward my next purchase).  i sniffed up some golden raisin, light alcohol, cocoa, toffee, and cork-like woody shades.   a stronger and better impact occurs  upon the tongue: a marverlous beer with micro-bubbled spritz that rolls out a red carpet for caramel apple sweetness, dark malts and fruity bakery-fresh yeast, apple butter on brown bread.  bitterness bites deeply and will not quickly yield, but echos deliciously like a sweet song in a deep canyon-- with an accent that leans to orange zest.  alcohol component certainly has nothing to be ashamed of, and walks with power and dignity among the more popular malt-hop textural aspects.  in terms of entertainment, i'd put it on a level nearly with aventinus.  it's price is it's most conspicuous defect-- hopefully the benevolent monks are feeding children in africa with the two dollars that they've overcharged for this bottle.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

2312,"2003-09-17",5.0,"Beer pours (in Chimay glass) a dark brown, near black with some dark red that light can penetrate with a medium amount of off-white head that dissipates, but develops a smooth top of head about 1/4 inch thick.

Bottle is 25.4 oz, cork is dated 12/02.  No alcohol aroma or flavor detected.  None.  This beer could benefit (IMHO) from being opaque, and not so bubbly on the tongue.  Those are this beers only faults.  However, the head more than makes up for the not-so-opaque appearance and this brew being smooth going down more than makes up for the initial tingling on the tongue.

2312,"2003-08-13",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2004 1987 Vintage, 33cl bottle: This was a bottle from 1987 that I had in 2001 at the Kulminator in Antwerp.  My first impression was that this beer was still quite good.  Had a bit of sherry in the nose, which I attribute to its age, as well as some dark caramel overtones.  The taste was still quite chimay like (imagine that).  The body was a bit thinner than younger version, and it was much more mellow with much of the esters, fruitiness, and bitterness having aged out.  Overall if I had to guess I would say that a well cared for 8 year old must be fabulous.
Sampled December 2004, 33cl bottle
Pours a fairly clear, deep ruby-amber-brown color.  It is topped by a tan head and is pretty well carbonated.  The aroma is fruity and musty, with notes of prunes, alcohol, and raisins.  The taste is sweet up front, with a rich malty center that moves to a fizzy rich finish.  This is actually quite a bit better than I was expecting it to be.  It is fairly light on the palate, especially given its strength, but it does have a slightly lingering rich malt note to it.  It is pretty fruity with concentrated notes of raisin and fig, as well as some spicy yeast notes that hint at ginger, cardamom, and clove.  The finish of this one reminds me some of sweet apple cider, it has a certain sharp, almost acidic fruity finish to it that is pretty interesting.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2312,"2003-08-10",2.7,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2008 Hazy maroon under a tan froth.  Spicy and sweet nose of cola, anise, basil and ginger snaps.  Boldly flavoured; biscuits and treacle clang against an earthy herbal bitterness that lingers into an alcohol dry finish.  Quite fluffy due to the carbonation with a creamy texture.

Lacks finesse and cohesion.  

33 cl bottle, best before 2013.

Update, 02-09-2007.  33cl bottle, Duvel tulip, bbe 2012.  Hazy brown hue with reddish highlights, covered by a moderate-sized tan head consisting of very large bubbles, which is quite short-lived.  Lots of cola in the aroma, followed by brown sugar, dates, rhubarb, prunes.   Hm, somewhat medicinal as well (aspirin), blending into some dry, grassy hops.  Toasted bread with cherry jam.  Husky and tannic, also.  The flavour is somewhat better, lacking any real aspirin flavour, but still failing to really impress.  Moderately sweet from start to finish with high acidity, and a prickling, peppery finish.  Quite flat on the tongue, watery despite being medium-full in body, with prickling carbonation.  Not so impressive any more, no.

75 cL bottle, tulip glass.  Large, off-white head stays fairly well.  Body is a deep brown with a red hue.  Rich aroma is nutty, spicy, with a hint of alcohol.  Lightly sugary also.  Flowery hops; nutty toasted bread/grain malt; mold and cobweb yeast.  Moderately sweet throughout with light acidity and light bitterness at the end.  Warm spices play well off the sweetness.  Medium-heavy body is creamy with lively carbonation.  The bottom line is: head could be denser, theres a little alcohol in the aroma and flavor, and too much carbonation (for me); but its damn fine in the way it all comes together.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"
2312,"2003-08-09",3.3,"Just off white head over a very hazy mohogany/brown body.  There is a smokiness that I get from this beer at first sniff.  Whether it's supposed to be there or not, I'm not sure, but it is there.  Roasted grain is noticeable once it starts to warm;  yeastiness and dark fruits (plums);  smokiness is still there.  Fairly dry for a strong dark.  Starts a little malty sweet then turns decidedly bitter and dry.  Hop flavor creeps into the aftertaste.  Roasted grain is mixed into mid palate along with yeast.  Dark fruit seems to be missing from this one in the flavor profile and is not quite as complex as I'd hoped, but it's not a bad beer.  Carbonation is on the higher side and has a probably lighter than actual m/f due to that fact.  This one is not one of my favorites for this style.  It seems to lack a little complexity and all in all just doesn't really ""do it"" for me.  After reading some of the other ratings, I either have a bad bottle, or my taste buds are just off.

Initial taste of sweet and slightly sour fruits (berrys? raisins?), followed by a lovely spicey yeasty taste. Slight biterness to it, not sure if its due to burnt grains or heavy(ish) hopping, cant really tell. Alcohol *very* well disguised, though beer is served at around 15 degrees.

Red, brown gold tones in the color with a range of peachy citrus to nutty/alcohol in the aroma.  VERY full bodied, meaty beer though.  Its almost like drinking a beer off the filter.  Certainly complex, and provides a variety of flavors when drunk at different temperatures.

Has aged magnificently.11/05 vintage dated 750mL bottle drunk on 7/7/07Raisins, pears, figs, apples and other mostly clean Belgian yeast esters, with caramel sweetness in the background.  Its a pleasant aroma, though even after only 3 months, my memory recalls little to distinguish this beer.  Or perhaps, more accurately, my memory recalls that there really is little to distinguish in this beer.Similar flavor profile, your typical well-made Quad, with soft malty sweetness (caramels, raisins, prunes, figs) and lighter, minimally tart apple/cherry esters towards the end.  Yeast seems more clean and less ""rustic"" or ""charming"" or what have you, than in past samples.  Musty, corky, earthy and woody are flavors I associated with this beer, for the better, but now its just a rather plain Belgian Dark Strong.

The aroma is non-offensive and mild. Its color is a dark non-transparent brown with some particles suspended. The flavor is mellow and very much top my liking. it is not overly strong though and does not have that immediate feeling that other strong beers can give.

I had noted previously that there were others who experienced this problem. Hence, my rating was lowered.

Re-Rate:
This rating came from a bottle at the Summer Gathering of 2003 that was advertised as being 9 years old.  It poured a medium head of fine to largely sized brown bubbles and a brown body.  It had a strong alcohol aroma.  The problem I had was that it may have been passed its prime.  I thought it smooth, but flat and was missing its true character.

The aroma is somehow interesting, there is an earthy and spicy touch. The body is on the thin side for this beer, the malt doesnt have enough depth, traces of vegetables; but the final is smooth.2010-02-18, parallel tasting, vintage 1988 (bb 1991), 22 years old, 7-3-7-3-14=34The cap is in good conditions, a bit rusty, but the rubber is still functional; it pours a brown color, initially with a small head, but that vanishes quickly in a whiff. Medium strength caramel aroma, with unmistakable oxidization vein, but not annoying; very light impression of dust and pond water too. It has a good body structure, stronger than most 20yearsold beers tasted so far, yet quite flat; caramel flavor, sweetish; the ageing created an extra flavor of mellow liquorice; almost no trace of bitterness, instead the sweetness is balanced by the alcohol, that is easily perceived through a pervasive warmth in the mouth. Interesting, but not outstanding.2010-02-18, parallel tasting, vintage 1998 (bb 2003), 12 years old, 7-4-6-3-13=33The cap is in good conditions; it pours a dark brown color, darker than the 1988; the head is initially large, but even after some time its still half a centimeter thick. Medium to light aroma, with some caramel and soap; also very light vanilla, wood, cake, nuts and Madeira; pleasant. Being more carbonated than the 1988, the mouthfeel seems lighter; its undoubtedly less sweet, even if there is a residual sweetness; there is some caramel flavor, less oxidization, and equally lack of bitterness, as well as there is almost no alcohol warmth. The two beers are similar, but in 10 years the 1998 wont become like the 1988: not enough malty.2010-02-18, parallel tasting, vintage 2008 (bb 2013), 2 years old, 6-4-7-3-13=33It pours a dark brown color, darker than the 1988; very large head, frothy more than creamy, but quite persistent. Medium to light aroma, with some caramel, soap, refined sugar, yeast. Average body structure, definitively slimmer than the 1988, possibly drier than the 1998; there is some caramel flavor, quite boring indeed; some more bitterness than in the other vintages, more balanced therefore; the final is also a bit nutty, and the alcohol warmth is just what is expected from a 9% beer. Unimpressive.2008-02-03, vintage 2000, 7 years old, Grande Reserve corked 75cl bottle, 6-5-7-3-14=35It pours a beautiful dark mahogany color with red shades, and a creamy head. It smells too much the cork, with some caramel too, and a touch of cellar. Medium body (maybe less than the fresh one), with a good dark caramel flavor. The bitterness is almost gone. At the end the alcohol nicely warms the tongue. In the end there is some complexity, wood flavors and traces of oxidization. More an experience than a great beer.2003-01-16, vintage 2001, 1 year old, 9-5-8-4-17=43Dark amber color, generous head, reducing to a thin creamy collar.Interesting aroma: malt, light liquorice, whisky; 1 extra point for the harmony, more than for the specific characteristics.Good body structure and perfect balance of malt and hop; pretty dry taste (considering the alcohol content and style); smooth, warming, some alcohol sensation; some caramel and liquorice.

Very Belgian, but a bit chemically towards the finish, some alcohol burn (which doesnt bother me too much), i just dont think the caramel/choc/fruit malt flavours blend so well together, relatively dry though, which is always a good thing in my book. Make sure you get it with a bit of age, and preferably in the corked 750ml bottles. A young Chimay isnt that good IMHO.

I dont really sense any complexity in the flavor at all, just a slight bitterness on top of minute malt characteristics.  And boy, did this beer have a lot of fizz.  The finish is very dry, but not entirely unenjoyable.  The bottle was only a year and a half old, so I sincerely hope that I didnt like it because it hadnt aged enough.

2312,"2002-11-06",4.4,"<P>The beer pours with a lazy, quick disipating head, which is surprising. Im used to having almost as much head as beer with belgian strongs. What head did form is a pale tan  with gray notes.  

<P>Theres a strong yeastiness to the aroma, almost like bread dough just as it starts to bake. The aroma is also very grapey/winey. It reminds me immediately of the wine the church I went to as a child uses for Communion. Below the yeast and wine I noticed a smell making me think of Rollos and Caramel Twix with light chocolate and caramel malt aromas.

<P>The flavor is an exercise in the melding of light and darkness. The bright flavors of bubblegum esters, yeastiness, the very faint sourness common to the style, chalk and the alcohol (very faint and only at the end) made for a very bright character that both contrasted and complimented the dark tones of the chocolate and caramel, a slight burnt bitterness and an even fainter smokiness. I was especially surprised to pick up on the burnt and smoke flavors, two flavors Ive never noticed in any of the Belgian strong dark ales.

<P>The palate is surprisingly carbonated considering the wimpy head but lacks the cottony carbonation that many of the lighter strongs (including Chimay Red) have that turns me off. The carbonation here balance the slightly creamy mouthfeel nicely.

<P>I was really surprised by this beer. Its probably one of very few of the style that Id actually buy on a regular basis.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
2312,"2002-11-05",4.9,"RE-RE-RATE: Okay, Im rating this on the strength of some 1995 vintage that I just had, which is an order of magnitude better than any food or drink that I have ever consumed.  Any beer with the potential to reach such greatness deserves such a rating, and it would get a solid 5.0 if it were like this all the time.  Incredible!!  Yeasty, champagnelike aroma.  Wine-ish, absolutely wonderful malty presence.  The complexity of this by far exceeds anything else I have ever tasted.  Where do I start?  Apples, pears, chocolate, prominent and somewhat Westvleteren-like yeast that I can still taste in my mouth an hour later.  I cant imagine how good this would be after 10 or 15 years.  RE-RATE #1: I have to re-rate this as one of my top 5.  In a time when Im trying to have as many new beers as possible, this is something that I keep buying and coming back to.  Chimay Bleu : beer snob :: Budweiser : redneck.  Great stuff.  Fruity taste, complex, caramel, woodiness, slight nut.  Malty finish, good balance, TONS of head.  I brought a bottle of this to a party the other night that had 3 kegs of Lone Star, just so I could be as out of place as possible.  I theorized that if I tapped anything from the kegs into my Chimay chalices, they would instantly shatter.  RE-RATE: Just had to give it another point, this is one that I always come back to!

The older the beer, the more fruitier, the more port-like and certainly more alcoholic. After 10 years of aging there isn't much taste-change anymore. After about half a year - year the beer is so much fuller of taste; it's a waste to drink rather new chimays. Just let them rest for a while.

2312,"2002-08-31",3.7,"Rerate On tap. This one still doesnt do it for me quite like the other trappistes but I still cant quite put my finger on it. Sure it looks nice and has a lasting beige head. The aroma is delicate but its still a bit faint, and this time I made sure I let it warm up. The typical spices, hop, fruit and yeast  aromas and flavours of the typical Belgian Strong Ale style are also all there. Theres just no WOW! factor like you get when you take that first mouthfull of the top Belgians. Maybe because this beer is so well known or maybe its just my mouth and nose are different.

2312,"2002-06-18",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2014 Rating based on aged samples A beer with an enormous potential. Apart from fresh Chimay Bleus ive also tasted two, three and (thanks to jbrus) five, ten, 15 and 20 year old ones. A fresh Chimay is nice, malty and a bit yeasty with notes of raisins, liquorice and some alcohol. However, it is nothing compared to aged one. After two years the flavour has not really changed much, but after 3 years an obvious difference occurs, its much more complex: malts, chocolate, coffee, fruits, raisins its all there. After five years the flavour has changed so much you wouldnt recognize it being a Chimay Bleu. Its more fruity and alcoholic, with an obvious port-like aroma and flavour. A ten year old one was IMO the best of the whole collection: incredibly full flavoured with long-lasting (alcoholic) finish and the aroma was one of the best ive ever experienced. Carbonation is totally lost in bottles aged for more than five years (NO head), but who cares? Its great! Remarkably, the 15 year old bottle was inferior to the 10 and 20 year old bottle. In conclusion, the flavour changes the most after five years of aging and reaches an optimum after 10 and 20 years (and perhaps even later...?). Additional note: Recently also sampled a four year old bottle (Grande Reserve 99). The flavour of this bottle was really in between a 3 year old (which still has the ""fresh"" Chimay Bleu flavour) and 5 year old (which is has totally different, more port-like flavours). My personal conclusion is that, if you want to drink a ""fresh-flavoured"" Chimay Bleu, you should stick to 3 year old bottles (much more complex than new bottles). After the turning point (5 years or older) more port-like, alcoholic and fruity flavours can be detected, which make it totally different from the ""fresh"" taste. This aged flavour is (IMHO) at best after 10 years (but still excellent after 20).","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"

Nice orangey-brown color. The aroma that came out of the bottle when I first uncapped it was wonderful scent of fresh yeast. From the glass it was more muted, but that could be due to the lingering cold I have.","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"

Just try drinking 2 good beers (4.0 and above) and a Chimay Blue in 1 row. I did and Chimay Blue sudenly doesnt seem that great anymore. Butterscotch and apple aroma. More like a Doppelbock than a BSA. Light hazy, ruby color, beige head, fair lace. Sweet, hints of vanilla, some licorice, laurel, soft bitterness.

Initially spicy and nutty with underlying sweet maltiness.  A world class brew.  Unfortunately, I chilled it a little much although I took nearly 45 minutes to finish it off. It warmed considerably and the true flavor and aroma came through.  Darn, now I have to try it again to get it right from start to finish!","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

Understated aroma is of sugary malt, plummy fruit, some yeast, spicyness, port, chocolate (as it warms) and alcohol. Medium bodied, lots of carb bite. Nice complex flavors of plums, cotton candy, yeast, some kind of spice, port, light chocolate and others. Late bitterness to round this out. Tasty and warming.

2312,"2001-08-20",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2004 Aug 2001:  Darkest Belgian brew I've had -- looks like a brown ale.  Nose is pleasant, slightly vinous, not strong enough.  Flavor -- wow! very sweet, malty, some alcohol hints (it IS 9%) but not enough to detract -- very complex and hard to grasp in just one bottle.  Beautiful cognac-like effect going down.  In short, great! 8/5/9/5/18=4.5

November 2003:  2002 bottle.  Seems much drier, more acidic, bit cardboardy in the flavor and less distinctive in the nose.  Bummer, maybe this is going downhill. 7/4/8/4=3.8

July 2004:  1.5 liter, 1993, shared with TAR and cb.  Massive caramel nose,  wisps of vanilla, whisky.  Huge plumminess, figs, caramel, dates; fairly dry finish, but black currants and brown sugar are present through to the end; dark thick brandy color; mostly quite full, but a bit thin late. 9/5/10/4/18=4.6

Conclusions:  drink this beer aged; I suspect that 10 years or so is just about right.  The plummy barley wine characteristic really suits the beer well and more than compensates for the aged thinness late in the mouthfeel.  This rating is an average of the three scores.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

The sweetness and malts were present in the falvor, as well as an alcoholic kick.  Aftertaste was mellow and somewhat musty.  Very nice.

2312,"2000-12-25",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2005 When I first had this beer, it was one of the first strong Belgians for me.  It blew me away.  Over the years, Ive felt that while it is a complex, tasty beverage, it has been eclipsed.  Whether it is me or the beer is debatable - and indeed the topic of the perceived decline of Chimay beers over the past decade is one of the most heated in the world of beer geeks.  Well, I finally decided to sit down and give this a proper re-rate.  Ive got a small bottle of 2004 from my local liquor store. The colour is kind of unusual in that there is a big disparity between the colour - under the light its a golden brown but in the glass its dark chestnut. The head is very light mocha.  The aroma is plummy, slightly bubblegummy with notes of honey, pears, sweet dark malts and a little bit of yeast.  Nice.  It has a sweet palate with pear, orange, and sultana notes.  A strong alcohol presence cuts through dusty yeastiness.  Flavour notes are well-fused, save for the obtrusive alcohol.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

Dark, opaque brownish red in color with ample carbonation and head.  Profoundly sweet and fruity, with a variety of dessert and baking spices, raisin and lightly warming alcohol.
