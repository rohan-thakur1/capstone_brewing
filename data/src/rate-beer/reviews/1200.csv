1200,"2016-10-28",4.1,"Bottle thanks to wchesser! Pours hazy butterscotch, medium off-white head, dissipates fairly quickly to some residual and lacing. Aroma is initially pretty green onion and garlic forward. After breathing a bit the tropical and slightly dank notes come out. Flavor is light plus sweet, light plus bitter, juicy and dank, not harsh and not hot, which are two plusses. Hints of onion remain. Medium body, slick mouthfeel.

1200,"2016-10-26",4.3,"Ohhhhhhhhh que cette bière me plaît! En plein le genre de IPA impériale que je bourdais chaque jour. Dès la capsule sautée, des arômes de pipi-de-chat mi vineux mi ammoniaqués envahissent la pièce. Mon ballon emplit de ce liquide orangé et mousseux me charme avec ces magnifiques promesses dexotisme dAsie du sud est. Corps absolument irréprochable où la bulle valse main dans la main avec un sucre résiduel très léger pour une bière qui frôle les 10% dalcool. Jamais sirupeuse, légère comme une plume, je suis transporté par ces intelligentes saveurs de raisin vert, de houblons fruités et de mandarine. Amertume parfaitement balancée, je partage avec mes amis un magnifique moment.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
1200,"2016-10-22",4.2,"Bomber. Tropical fruit hop aroma with grapefruit citrus and a little bit of pine resiny hop notes. Pours clear golden colored with a large white head that has excellent retention and and some lacing. Starts with juicy tropical fruit hop flavors with a little bit of grapefruity hop citrus. Finishes dry with grapefruit acidity and flavor as well as a little bit of pine resiny hop bitterness at the very end. Nice IPA, not too bitter, well done.","","zoucrew102"

1200,"2015-12-01",4.4,"Bomber - the appearance is a clear golden yellow with a med to thin off white head that coats my crystal IPA glass. The aroma is completely hop centric- tangerine, fresh orange zest, mild tropical notes and a whiff of pine. Huge hop favor with heavy citrus, pine resin, peach, a hint of bitter grassiness and some nougat type flavor. Long lasting hop finish. Outstanding DIPA","Bayfield, Colorado, USA","CObiased"
1200,"2015-10-20",4.0,"Bomber from Stacys Wine & Liquor. I can smell the hops upon simply opening the cap. This beer pours a deep orange with a rather clear body and a long lasting white head. In the glass, the beer is very aromatic with hints like pine and herb. Palate is medium dense. This is brutally bitter in the mouth, but with some rich hop flavor to back it up. A good dose of crystal malt gives some sweetness for balance.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

A steady pour into my teku glass produces a three finger thick, light brown colored head. The beer is a bright copper color that shows a clear, rich golden hue when held up to the light. the aroma has a spicy tropical fruit note to it up front with a dank, herbal edge; peppery guava, nettle leaning lychee, bright papaya, ample gooseberry notes, ripe kumquat zest, amped up tangelo zest, greenly herbal pine notes, and just a hugely funky, spicy, tropical fruit note that I just cant properly put words too are all quite noticeable. There is no hint of distinguishable malt character in the aroma, it all just supports the dominant hop character.

The beer has a viscosity to it that lingers a bit on the palate before being wiped clean from a biting bitterness that has an astringent hop edge to it. The beer is quite quaffable though, and is about what I look for in a Double IPA. Hugely expressive hop notes provide an up front explosion of guava, woody mango, peppery gooseberry, perhaps some nettle notes, and a definite woody character that suggests at pine and ""hemp"". The malt character plays a purely supporting role here, there is a certain soft, round (suggesting of sweet malt) quality that accentuates the hop fruit character and there is perhaps a hint of caramelized grain and English biscuit like flavors that come through in the finish. At times there is a touch of warming alcohol that comes through, though this stays well restrained most times.

This is a really nice Double IPA; quite quaffable, with a pure hop focus that has a huge fruit character balanced by spicy, herbal, bitter, and dank hop character.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
1200,"2015-08-03",4.5,"On draft at GABF 2014. Pours a hazy orange-amber with a white head. Nose is some caramel, some orange, some grapes, and some tropical fruit with bits of other citrus.

1200,"2014-10-16",4.4,"Enjoyed at gabf 2014. It pours with a great looking crystal clear copper body that has gold hues and supports a near white head. This has big Nelson aromatics with mango and grape with a bit of spicy dankness and then a thin sweet malt base off in the background. The taste delights as its bold and rich and balanced with plenty of bittering hops and flavor hoppiness going on. Wow, I get spicy garlic and onion dankness and mango, sweet white grapes and then a thin layer of floral hoppiness at the edges of the experience. Terrific stuff.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Bottle: The aroma consists of tropical fruits, peach, mango, and a touch of dank notes. It pours a slightly hazy amber with a small white head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a slightly thicker ring. The flavor starts with citrus, tropical fruits, and peach. The finish has light-moderate grapefruit, dank notes, and a touch of lemon. Its light-medium bodied with soft carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
