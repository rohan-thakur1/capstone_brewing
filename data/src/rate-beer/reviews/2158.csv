 Brown and cloudy in colour, beige head disappears quickly. The nose is smooth, yeasty, slightly sugary. The Sahti starts smooth, very nice. Brown malt, cane sugar, plums. No hint of the 9%. The mainpart continues very smooth. Herbal notes come to the malty, brown sugary taste, still very smooth. Yeasty. The aftertaste is long. Only very gentle bitter. Here the typical characteristics of the rye-malt are obvious, a bit nutty, smooth, only gentle herbal - this note could be a bit more intense. On the tongue lays a thick layer of smooth maltiness, plums, cane sugar. And here you can feel the warming aspect of the 9%. But not sharp or anything like that.  --> Great stuff! Not as strange as I expected, but very interesting. The taste can somehow be compared to a dark Bavarian Weizenbock. --> 13/13/14/13","Wuppertal, GERMANY","Erzengel"
