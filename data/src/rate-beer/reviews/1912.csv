1912,"2012-10-27",3.2,"Bottle, LCBO. I have had this before and just did not rate it I guess.  Orange pour, small white head.  Metallic hops, fruit in mild aroma.  taste - good.  Lots of fruitiness, but also lots of hops over a medium tingly well carbonated body.  Residual fruit/hop sweetness in end - almost honey like that does nothing for me but initial taste is solid.  Ive enjoyed black creek beers but this is only one I would not buy again so far - not up to usual high standard.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"

Pours an orange red brew with a humble head (Lovibond 14). Smells of fruit and bread. Taste is very unbalanced with a terrible astringent, acidic aftertaste. Malty and fruity in the first swig, but that aftertaste kills my joy. Mouthfeel is okay, but somewhat flat and soft. Now, a pint is just too much of this.","Ontario, CANADA","Digital_Aura"

Aromas of faint citrus with very bready notes and sweet toffee malt. Toffee becomes more evident, moving into caramel range. Some sweet dried fruit as well.  Pours a clear copper colour with a solid 1"" head, light pillowy. Active carbonation evident.  Tastes as it smells at first, mostly sweet bread and dried fruit. Hops is a little surprising, very herbal. There is not much punch but pretty bitter finish. Lighter carbonation than I would have expected from the appearance. The ale is very light in mouthfeel. Overall, pretty sweet at first but the very herbal finish is slightly cloying (not in the sweet way) on tongue. A fresher bottle would have been nice.","Ontario, CANADA","scantron"

Dark gold colour with a thin offwhite head. Aroma is largely neutral, a bit of malt and a bit of hops but fairly unobtrusive.

1912,"2011-11-01",3.5,"My Bottom Line :  
This bitter Pale Ale aligns subtle oranges and green wood onto toasted bread and caramel in a mouthfeel awash with bubbles. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A healthy head of foam clings to the deep amber orange haze, leaving plenty of lacing.
-This is brewed at Trafalgar?! Well, at least we know the equipment is not problematic there...
-Effervescence is a tad too much. I can see this flavor profile seducing me even more in a cask-like natural mouthfeel.
-The wooden, peppery hop bitterness is lengthy.
-This is on the dry side for the style. Quite the enjoyable quaff!

Mouth feel is medium-thin, dry and highly carbonated. Taste is very fresh and hoppy. Citrus, grapefruit, lemon, apples, violets, pine, grass, oak, nuts. There is a strong bitterness throughout that intensifies into rich, heavily burnt flavors during the finish. The finish is long and extremely bitter, leaving grapefruit, burnt coffee beans, burnt toast, charcoal, and ash sitting atop some residual floral aromas.

1912,"2011-07-01",3.4,"In short: A somewhat dry and astringent toasted hoppy amber ale with a citrusy and foresty hop profile.  Overall enjoyable
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed fresh the day after purchase.
The look: Cloudy golden-amber body topped by a medium off-white head leaving good lacings
In long: Nose is mostly citrusy hops with some toasted malts and scented flowers notes.  This doesnt smell like a hop bomb and nor should it, but there is a pleasant freshness in the aroma.  Taste is grainy toasted malts, bread crumbs, some citrus fruits (mainly grapefruits and orange peels) but also some freshly cut pine-tree.  Very low sweetness sensation, very little caramel and/or honey and/or dried fruits.  This beer is actually rather dry for the style.  I usually give higher scores for drier beers but this one came with a strong astringency that I didnt particularly enjoy.  Appropriate medium carbonation.  Despite the slightly deficient malt bill and the astringency I thought this beer has a nice freshness to it and I can imagine myself drinking many pints of this in a night.  Anyway, Im rating this beer from home on Friday pm July 1.  Because today we dont work in Canada.  July 1 is Canada Day.  Except up here we call it C-eh? n-eh? d-eh?
