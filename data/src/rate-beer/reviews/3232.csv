Appearance: A pale gold color with half a finger of a creamy looking head on it. Lacing was pretty nice. Looks great for the style.

Smell: Lime and cereal/malty notes. Really not much else to say here, but its really pleasing.

Taste/feel: More than I expected. I know its Shorts, but I was thinking going into this that Id be highly unimpressed and itd taste like a slightly crafty Corona or Dos Equis ... dude, holy ignorance. This beer tastes like, I dont know if anyone remembers them, but the Mystery Flavor (Mountain Dew) Doritos from 2008, or the Lime Tostitos (Not sure if they make those anymore either)... its almost the exact same lime flavor on the start, and then its just a quality craft lager the rest of the way. The lime note adds an awesome flavor to this beer that makes it stand out a bit without it being off-putting or overwhelming.
