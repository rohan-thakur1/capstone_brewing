669,"2012-05-16",3.8,"0.75l bottle from beermerchants.com This one pours a deep deep dark brown body and it has a small but intense bubbly and sidesticking dark woody-brown head. It smells really intense and somewhat dark-caramel sweet with lots of woody and chocolate tones, some clear red dried fruity tones as well and perhaps also a tone of cold coffee. Flavors are quite out there on the sweet side, perhaps a bit to far out if you ask me, but it still manages to feel somewhat balanced. A soft to average carbonation level and the texture feels sticky and thick in the mouth. Toffee caramel with berries and red-alcohol is clearly dominating, but there are also tones of cold coffee, chocolate, wood and candy. Yeah, I liked it, but perhaps just a tad to sweet for my tongue?

It pours a dark, dark brown in color with a one finger velvety smooth beige colored head. It was a very, very smooth pour and was medium to full in body. It smells of slightly sweet dark malts, cream, with a light hazelnut aspect. Its really intriguing. The flavors are phenomenal and complex. It tastes of light cocoa powder, cream, light vanilla, light toffee, and light cherries. Everything is so well integrated that its the perfect blend, overly flavorful, and not too sweet. This beer is exceptionally smooth and perfect on the palate. The aftertaste too is phenomenal. Overall this is hands down the best scotch ale Ive had to date. What a beer!

669,"2011-07-02",4.6,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a chalice.

Appearance: Pours a dark cola brown with beautiful ruby red highlights and a 3 finger frothy medium tan colored head featuring tiny carbonation bubbles. Excellent creamy lacing coating the glass.

Smell: Tons of malt and cocoa with a touch of dried fruits. Smells a lot like Hersheys Whoppers.

Taste: Very sweet mix of flavors up front including cocoa and sweet malt with a touch of caramel up front followed by a light amount of hops in the middle and ending with lightly toasted malt at the finish. Aftertaste is mildly bittersweet and quite appealing. Very well-balanced beer that keeps the alcohol completely hidden.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and creamy with a fairly high amount of prickly carbonation that gives it just about the perfect feel for me. Really coats the palate.

Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. The alcohol will sneak up on you since you really dont even notice that its there.

Overall: Excellent beer overall. Cigar City has really knocked it out of the park with this one. Ive liked just about every Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy that Ive tried and this one does nothing to change that.

669,"2011-04-05",4.5,"For over a year, Ive been trying to find ONE Scotch Ale that comes even close to the flavor and taste of McEwans Scotch Ale, which is on hiatus from being imported to the US. If you read my other reviews youll see Ive been through a LOT of them:
Wet Willys
Alesmith
Belhaven
Traquair House
Jolly Scott
Scotty Karate
Skullsplitter
Old Chub
Arcadia
Berkshire
French Broad
And more.

Ive liked some. Disliked others. NONE of them have the taste that McEwans brings to the table. I was dismayed and thought Id never get it again. I have a couple last bottles of Mac here that Id been saving. Ive been looking for some to trade in Canada where they apparently still exist, but its been rough.

So, after trying so many other SAs with nothing close (Alesmith was the closest and its a far jump) I halfheartedly opened a bottle of Big Sound last night.

Delightedly, I find that it aims squarely for the McEewans flavor and may even SURPASS it in every way. I went and read their web description. Cherries! Whod have thought? And heres me slamming every quad that sneaks freaking cherries into their blend!

So - if you like and miss McEwans - give this a try. I have a Mac opened and am going back and forth. Mac is definitely more soy sauce/tobbacco, while the BS is a bit sweeter - but its a fine line.
Heres the real BA rundown:

APP: Deep dark mahogany body with a beautiful full-figured head on top in vanilla caramel colors.

Smell: Molasses, Toffee, and apparently old cherries. I would have said English Fruitcake - but same thing.

Taste: Malt bomb, dark caramel syrupy sweet. Not too stouty, so a good drinker but really big flavor. Toffee, cherries, dark candied fruit, a little coffee, burnt sugar. Molasses. Wonderful.

Overall - just freaking amazing and an easy drinker.","Pennsylvania, USA","radioscooter"

Low to no carbonation and slick, heavy mouth feel.  Overall, a pretty good tasting scotch ale that is really rich.  It tastes good, but almost becomes a chore to drink.  I also feared there was an infection problem upon initially smelling/tasting the beer, as there was an odd tartness present, but it seemed to disappear rather quickly.  This would be a nice drink on a cold night in smaller quantities.","Aurora, Colorado, USA","BlackForestCO"

Perfect harmony of sweet and caramel malts and a taste that really subdued any alcohol that was present. This is perhaps the best scotch ale I have tried.

669,"2010-09-23",4.1,"Let it be said instantly - This is without doubt the best beer with the disignation of ""Scotch Ale"" I have ever tasted. The pour is all brown with a cappochino colored head that allmost have an orange glow. The aroma is smokey caramel with both peaches and oranges and with a malty profile topped with some nice bitter notes. The taste is huge and as I said far more intens and interesting than other scotich ales I have had. I am thinking of those neat chocolates with Crand Marnier inside. A mild sourness somewhere far away. It has been malted with a fine bitterness and has a palate that tends to bite but at the same time heavy and fat with a long lasting sweet caramel-like finish.

I count Big Sound among the better group, but its still a bit too sweet and sticky for me.  The flavors are nice, though.  Big caramel, toffee and molasses.  Maybe a hint of some fruitier notes, like apricot, and maybe some smoke but not enough to make an impact.  Round feel, though it finishes kinda sticky.  Good enough beer, just sweet.  I tend to compare every Scotch Ale to AleSmiths Wee Heavy, and this beer doesnt hold up to that one.

Poured a cloudy chocolate color with a persistent brown froth.  Nose was huge on malt with a small cherry character and maybe a little bit of mineral aroma.  Fantastic flavor with a complex malt profile. Has notes of sweet toffee, cocoa, overripe fruits and a little bit of smoke.  Shows a little bit of peat in the background, but nothing over the top.  The palate has a thick but non syrupy texture that suits the style well. Carbonation is present throughout, but never in the way.  The finish is relatively clean and ends with a sweet malt note.

Taste is suited to the nose, with the early palate bringing a full, nutty, almond bitterness, followed by a sweet malty caramel, accompanied by soy sauce.  There is a faint metallic taste to the finish, but over all, this is good, especially for a style I dont typically enjoy too much.  The early bitterness, balanced by the mid-to-late sweetness is just great.  There is even a touch of bread and coffee in this brew, as far as I can tell.  Excellent stuff.

I must say it may have influenced my score some by adding to the experience I even lit up a Liga Privada no.9 for my second glass which paired prefect in my book. The brew had a tan colored head on top of a dark brown body, and the head lasted leaving great lacing on the side of the glass.

Big roasted malt aromas come from this brew, so you get some coffee espresso notes. Now It might have been the campfire but I did get a slight hint of smoke LOL. It had a medium to light body. I wished for a tad more probably my only knock on the brew. 

The flavor was great, it had a healthy amount of sweet caramel malts to me with the right amount of roasted bitters to keep this brew well balanced. Again I did get some smokiness to it as well, but like I said the atmosphere enhanced this one. 

A great scotch ale well worth the effort to obtain. The drinkability was off the charts for me. I would love another bottle (hint)","Skowhegan, Maine, USA","Pastor"

The beer is not intense but with every sip I noted a little something else.  Overall the beer is smooth and pleasantly not too sweet for a Scotch Ale.

Not the caramel/toffee lovefest that too many scotch ales are.  Interesting take on the style.  Another solid beer from Cigar City.  That brewery may be a bit over-hyped but they really put out quality beer after quality beer.  Surprisingly I have never been to Florida in my life.  Never.

There is a rather vinous tone to the whole thing that I like quite a bit. Some vanilla and wood float around, and theres an earthy sweetness to the finish that sticks on the palate for a while.

669,"2010-03-29",3.9,"He poured clear browns dark and polished with glints of burnt amber streaking along the edges of my vision. A cappuccino head foams and burbles before settling into a soft comforter of epic snoozing proportions. I tease his depths which leaves a few patches of lace while releasing a massive nose of Scotch Ale delights. Big Sound is right because if a beers nose could declare itself in regalia, this one would be a cacophony delight of horns, trumpets, and bagpipes. Spices announce themselves first with cinnamon, nutmeg, and powdered ginger. As spices dance in selfless delight, a gentle river of licorice babbles nearby. Dried prunes and figs tag along for the ride. A crisp snap in the back is all about candied red apples while that holiday horror, fruitcake, rears its ugly head. In this instance, think of the candied fruits, sugars, and spices that usually accompany this brick of tooth decay. As spices continue to sooth and delight, chili peppers simmer in the background above a slow fire, the old wood embers glowing softly in the low light. Rounding out his richly complex nose is cold burnt chocolates, dark and brittle in the best ways possible. Wow. Talk about a massive nose; an opus of historical note. Wiping the inevitable drool off my chin, I drink deep and long. Rich, full, smooth, creamy, and mouth-coating; if only all first impressions were this satisfying. A long bitter burnt finish rich with bakers and burnt chocolate immediately makes his presence known. A total turn-around from his nose. Dried chili permeates his palate front, center, and back. Exuding gentle warmth, the heat tickles and teases without compromising his scotch ale brethren. Take dried prunes and dates, add blender, push button, and watch-smell-taste as they are pureed into a sticky ooey-gooey mess of dark fruit delights. Old wood still tainted with the essence of earth crackles and chars, the black ash and burnt wood essence perfectly complementing burnt chocolate. His finish is long. Breathing deep once more, cinnamon and nutmeg tinge my breath while long tendrils of ABV weave their way through my chest. As Big Sound slowly warms and my glass slowly diminishes in wealth, I am left with a heart-rending dilemma: I dont want to finish. No, nothing is wrong with my beer; quite the opposite. I dont want to say goodbye, so deliciously profound has this quaffing session been. My heart rends and aches at such cruel realitybut all good beers must come to an end, I suppose. It didnt make it any easier, Ill tell you that.


One of Cigar Citys first brews to see life in bottled-form, Big Sound Scotch Ale was delightfully different and heavenly delicious scotch ale. In comparison with other scotch ales, Big Sound definitely stands on his own, a proud member of his lineage, but resolute in his own independence. A bottle of Big Sound may be hard to come by, but if you should be so lucky, cradle that bottle lovingly against your fast-beating heart all the way home.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

669,"2010-02-28",4.1,"Appearance: Pours out an opaque, dark brown body accented with some amber highlights and topped with a half-inch of beige head.

Smell: The aroma is plushly malty, rooted around a concentrated toasty breadiness coated with sweet-scented caramel. This is supported with notes of chocolate, roasty coffee, and a fruitiness that grows even bolder when the beer is given a moment to warm up a bit.

Taste: Deep robust maltiness with a fair amount of soothing sweetness. Tastes of caramelized sugars, toasted bread crusts and, whaddya know, even some chocolate-coated grains and coffee are present, as is a vibrant dried dark fruitiness. Undercurrent of earthiness throughout. Very low, subtle hop bitterness. A bit more breadiness and a touch more roast in the lightly warming finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel.

669,"2010-01-01",3.7,"750mL bottle.  Poured cola brown with a short, swirly cap of beige head.

I didnt like it initially, but it grew on me.  The flavor found a bed of caramel laced with sweeter chocolates, toffee, and brown sugar at the core.. tart darker fruits played a lesser role than on the nose, dancing delicately around the edges.. more sweetness plus banana-influenced yeast on the edges.. caramel, brown sugar, and toffee sweetness on the long, somewhat warming finish.

669,"2009-10-04",3.6,"750 ml shared at Flossmoors Oktoberfest. Pours a nice dark brown raisiny pour, red ad brown and near opaque, a good tannish head that dies to a thick film that laces, bubbly. Not bad looking. Aromas are a good dar fruit, cherry and raisin, with caramel and toffee malts with a creamy sweetness, a touch of peat, but dark fruit dominant over any peaty smoke, a touch of vanilla. Fairly sweet. Body is moderate, a good underlying sweetness, caramel and dark fruit, a bit syrupy and sweet in the finish and lingering on the palate, light bitterness, a touch of vanilla. Raisin, faint peat, roasty malts. A thicker, sweeter beer. Decent balance, a little big for me. A good candidate for Barrel Aging it seems, to kill a little thickness/sweetness. Not bad.

669,"2009-08-28",3.7,"750mL bottle courtesy of Gillard, poured into a snifter.

Pours a very dark mahogany brown in the glass that shows a dark, clear copper when held up to light.  Theres a solid creamy tan head that recedes fairly slowly and leaves almost no lacing.

The aroma is pretty subtle and straight-forward for the style with a big slightly-smoked caramel malt backbone with some dark fruit mixed in.  Hints of molasses and chocolate are in there is well.

The taste is a more vibrant version of the nose with the sweetness still dominating but with a more pronounced smoked peat flavor, especially in the finish which is slightly dry and has more coffee bitterness than I was expecting.  The dark fruits, chocolate and vanilla all contribute to the sweetness.

The mouthfeel is very smooth and medium to full bodied with good carbonation.

This is a solid effort from Cigar City and a very good Scotch ale.  I wouldnt put it near the top of the list of their beers, but its a drinkable and sweeter version of the style.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

669,"2009-08-12",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Peated smoke lengths diversify this Scotch Ales roasted and toasted cereals, while subtle cherry esters and peppery hops create complexity.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy veil of foam covers the cloudy dark brown red.
-Alcohol is very well hidden.
-This is not too sweet, which is appreciated.
-The nose is friendly, yet could be more inviting considering the wealth of the flavor profile.

Overall:  I almost regret trying this beer at the gathering just because I think it didnt get a fair shake due to so much beer flowing!  This beer wasnt bad by any means, but it seems more like a Brown Porter to me than a Scotch Ale.  I was super excited about trying it and wasnt able to find any of the richness, depth, and other complexities that I was hoping for.

669,"2009-06-20",3.4,"A solid pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a three finger thick, nicely amber tinged, full amber color.  The beer is a dark amber color that has a concentrated redness to it.  When held up to the light the beer shows a nicely concentrated, red, ruby color.  The beer has an interesting note to it up front, it is quite sweet with an almost cinnamon like character to it sweetness; almost reminds me of a deeply caramelized, cinnamon sweetened red-hot.  There is a touch of toasted grain underneath the sweet aroma.  Perhaps this is a bit too cold (though it is at 50ºF / 10ºC), a quick stint in the microwave has me noticing a bit more caramel character rather than straight sweetness, some berry like fruit character as well as more toasted malt character.  Actually the sticky sweetness has now all but disappeared.  The aroma started out a bit on the simplistic side, but it does get a bit better if you really let it warm up, though it still doesnt quite have the complexity that I was hoping for.

This is sweet tasting with a thick, chewy body that easily tames the sweetness, which definitely is not cloying.  The beer finishes with a touch of warming alcohol as well as a chewy, whole grain toastiness, and a deeply caramelized malt character.  A bit of caramelized, marshmallow character is in the middle and the finish has a hint of roast grain that adds just a hint of bite to balance a smidge of the sweetness.  This does have some salty smokiness to it as well, which is quite subtle and I would guess is not from any actual peat smoked malt.  This has a touch of fruitiness to it with mostly a raisin-like note that likely is contributed by the malt character.  While the sweetness is not too much in this warmed up beer, it does still have a candy like note to it with all of the caramelized specialty malt character floating around in this beer.  

In hopes of cutting the sweetness I have taken to eating an overly sweetened brownie, this does tame the beers sweetness, but actually brings a touch of tartness out in the beer.  It does accentuate a touch more of the light roast character, a slight bit more smokiness, as well as bringing out more of the toasted malt character.

Not a bad beer, I must admit that I got a bit too caught up in excitement around this brewery, my expectations of grandeur where probably a bit too much, but I was expecting a lot more from this beer.  It doesnt quite have the complexity and balance that I really want to see in a great example of the style.  Really my biggest complaint here is that the beer has a bit too much sweetness; it does need some sweetness, but if it was a touch drier it would really allow a lot more complex malt character to come through.  A touch more age might round this out a bit though; six months to a year might see this beer peaking.  I am still quite excited to try other beers from this brewery, they seem to be doing some really creative things.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

I actually prefer the flavor slightly to Alesmith Wee Heavy. In fact Overall I think I like this better. Its reminiscent more of Belhaven Wee Heavy in its flavor profile but with a balancing of hops that keeps the sweetness in check. Rich roasted chocolate up front followed by thick notes of caramel and cherry. Some strong raisin and fig and even a bit of light smoke and leather. Simply AMAZING. The palate is super thick and I was amazed this was only 8.5% not because of the alcohol which is non existant, but because the palate is just insanely full. Massive body. Chewy and rich.

The taste starts smooth and sweet moving toward increasing levels of roasted maltiness. But first I get cherries and toffee mixing with a brief pulse of dark grape jam. Then an array of malts descend on the palate jabbing away with toffee, biscuit, melanoidin, more toffee and malt roastiness. Beyond midway coffee and chicory goodness enter and help bring the dark fruitiness and malts toward the finish. It ends with chocolate, chicory, faint dark roasted coffee beans, figs, cherries, toffee and mildly drying roasted malts.

669,"2009-05-11",4.0,"Draft at Redlight Redlight. This one pours a hazy, dark brown color with a small, foamy cream colored head. The head settles leaving rings of lacing around the glass. The aroma is really rich and malty with toffee and caramel coming forward to go with hints of dark fruits, roast, and some earthy hops. The flavor follows the rich malt theme with sweet toffee and creamy caramel coming first to go with some figs and stewed raisins. There is a slight hint of cherry in there as well. Some cocoa and roasted coffee come through to balance out the fruit sweetness. Toasted malts and earthy hops bring nice bitterss on the backend and tie everything togethe nicely. The mouthfeel is full and very creamy with a lingering roasty finish and a touch of the alcohol warmth. This is a big, rich, and malty scotch ale with great flavors and complexity. Really well done. I would love to see what some smoked peat would add.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
669,"2009-05-10",4.2,"I have been looking forward to trying this one for a while! 75cl bottle from Whole Foods (Tampa, FL). Pours a murky, muddy, dark brown to black with one finger tan/cinnamon head that settles slowly. Aroma is sweet and malty with notes of roast, caramel, raisins, figs, some hints of cocoa. Flavor is sweet and malty with notes of toffee, light roast, caramel, figs, raisins, cocoa, dark ripe fruits, some hints of earthiness and cream. Generally medium to full body with a pleasing syrupy, malty finish.","Tampa, Florida, USA","kiefdog"
669,"2009-05-10",4.3,"Pours a murky brown/black. Thin tan head. Nose is initially boozey then roasty as hell. sweet caramel nose. Flavor is a wonderful alcoholic malt bomb. Roasty, dark fruits, some charred flavor. Mouthfeel is very full, slightly oily. Very very smooth. Drink this one on the warmer side to let the alcohol come out. Beautiful. Incredible scotch ale.","Alaska, USA","gkost"
669,"2009-05-09",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 11, 2009 Murky, foggy brown body with creamy mocha head.  Roasty, Toasty malt with caramel notes and toffee on the nose sweet fruit mild chocolate and bright finish.  the bottle fermentation gives the beer a soft and subtle mouth feel.  All around solid.","Tampa, Florida, USA","ObsceneOne"
669,"2009-05-05",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 6, 2009 Draft at Redlight Redlight. A dark, chewy looking, muddy brown body is crowned by a small layer of creamy, khaki colored foam. Thin, broken, frosted glass sheeting coats the glass well. The nose is really rich and malty, showing a huge nougat component, stewed raisin, medium-dark cocoa, caramel, figs, and sweet, dark cherries. Theres a good deal of barley roast going on as well, which brings a nice earthiness into the fold. Flavors follow suit, rich nougat, and caramel leading the charge.  A bevy of dark, stewed fruits lend sweet complexities, fig and raisin showing strongest. Again, rich barley and cocoa roast bring an earthy, toasty balance to all the fruity sweetness. The mouthfeel is full and lush, very creamy, finishing with some alcohol warmth and lingering roast. A bit of stickiness is all that holds it back. Joey and Wayne were shooting for an ultra-malty, rich, imperial wee heavy, and I would say they passed with flying colors. A little smoked peat would put this over the edge.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
669,"2009-05-04",3.8,"draft @ redlight redlight.  Rich toffee and caramel malt aromas.  Pours a cloudy rich brown color with a thick off white head.  Rich malt flavors, toffee, caramel with hints of darker molasses and dark fruits like caramelized figs and smoked dates in the flavor.  Very smooth beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
669,"2009-05-04",4.0,"Draft @ redlight redlight. Pours a deep murky, ruddy brown with a creamy tan head. Some nice lacing. Big malty scotch ale, not peaty, but complex with dark fruits, some chocolate roast, that doppelbock malt midrange, brown sugar and a touch of the alcohol coming through as it warms. Lush mouthfeel, low carbonation, a bit drying at the finish from the alcohol.","San Francisco, California, USA","cmillward"
669,"2009-05-03",4.1,"Bottle thanks to Wayne.  Pours a slightly hazy brown with a tan head.  Nose is sweet malt, caramel, some maple sweetmess.  Taste is malt everywhere with caramel/ toffee sweetness, and some smoke with a tiny amount of hops to level off this masterpiece.  Very nice, medium-bodied beer that leaves nice lacing.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
669,"2009-05-03",4.0,"Bottle courtesy of Wayne. Pours a slightly hazy dark brown with amber highlights with a one finger light tan head that leaves good lacing. Aroma of sweet malts, caramel, with toasted and light roasted malts in the background. Taste is lots of malt with a drying roasty toasty finish. Medium mouthfeel with a mild a mount of bitterness and medium soft carbonation. A damn fine beer.","Florida, USA","afterglow"
669,"2009-05-03",4.0,"Draft at Redlight.  Pours a cloudy dark brown color with a thick tan head.  Aroma is full of malts and caramel, with a nice roast.  Flavor has a huge malt, with the same toasted characteristics that make the Cigar City brown ales so delicious.  I dont know if it is simply the freshness or not, but I love that flavor.  The rich malt and toast leads into a slightly smokey finish with a little bit of hops popping up in there.  I cant believe this is packing 8.5-9%ABV.  It is hidden well.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"
669,"2009-05-02",4.0,"On tap @ Redlight.  Hazy dark amber color with a medium broken light khaki head.  Aroma is mostly rich sweet caramel, but a slight earthen character is present.  The taste is more distinct, with a rich sweetness that isnt overbearing, some toffee and toasted grains, and the balance of some earthy hops that is welcome.  Im very picky about my Scotch ales, and usually require a hint of peat or smoke to put a Scotch at a 4 or above, but this one uses the malt richness so well.","Florida, USA","JMFG"
