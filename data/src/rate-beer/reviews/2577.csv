2577,"2014-03-04",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Spicy rye and hefty malt sweetness benefit from candied fruitiness and light floral notes in this rich pint of nostalgia.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam laces atop the misty dark red.
-The mouthfeel and malt profile on this one have some Doppelbock qualities.
-Alcohol is a no show in the flavour profile.
-This is low on the hop bitterness, making the body feel even heavier.

2577,"2012-10-28",4.1,"On draft at Churchkey in D.C.

The beer is a dark chestnut hue, with 1/4"" of tan head that leaves sparse lacing on the snifter. The aroma is very inviting, with malt, bread, pine, hops. The flavor surpasses my expectations. Rye and hops are balanced extremely well, and the beer has a bold, delicious flavor. The beer is medium bodied, with solid carbonation. Alcohol is masked quite well. A terrific brew, I would certainly have this again.

Very nice aroma. Fruity esters and rye are main components, the rye adding a slightly spicy touch, some smoky malts, hints of tobacco. Dark rye bread and burned crust give a bitter touch to a rather sweet palate. This beer cements my love for rye beers. Really delicious and a great winter warmer.","Copenhagen (formerly Aalborg), DENMARK","phredrik"
2577,"2011-11-20",3.6,"500 ml bottle from Wine and Cheese Place. Pours a semi-cloudy reddish amber with a small off-white head.

2577,"2011-11-15",3.6,"Draft at Ginger Man in NYC. The pour yields a lightly hazy, dark chestnut colored body with a small, smooth, cream colored head that quickly settles to a thin film.  A soapy wash mostly rejoins the body, save for a few thin, splotchy flares. Aromas very much show the rye from the name, suggesting of fresh rye bread and dry toasted caramel, touching on almost burnt
cookie, dry cacao, and mild gingerbread spice. Flavors show a similar balance of sweet malt and roast, loaded with spicy rye, baked bread, and dryish choco-caramel.  It drinks easy for an 8% brew, thanks largely to the smooth, easy going, moderately substantive palate.  Carbonation is soft and balanced.  The finish is lightly drying, with just a little bit of sticky residual sugar.  Overall, its a very solid beer.  Id gladly drink this again.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

2577,"2011-11-01",4.0,"Bottle at home. Pours deep walnut brown, 1-finger off-white head, very persistent, nice lacing, if a bit spotty. Honestly I was expecting more of a Rye Pale Ale, but this darker brew will do just fine. Nose is very lemony, definitely a hoppy brew, lots of lemon candy and lemongrass, nicely seated atop a very aromatic and spicy malt base. The spice is very prevalent, and almost cedary, and does seem to be coming from the malt (the rye?) rather than the hops, though I could certainly be mistaken. Flavours are rich, smoky, and dare I say it: A bit reminiscent of HOTD Adam... Big and smoky and rich, some raisiny/tobacco sweetness, but overall quite dry. The 8% alcohol is remarkably well-hidden, with no real heat noticeable, although the finish is a touch shorter than I had perhaps expected.

Head is initially large, creamy, off-white to light brown, fully lasting.
Body is hazy medium amber/brown, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is moderately malty (toasted grain/bread, caramel, cookie), lightly to moderately hoppy (apricot, resin), with light notes of smoke, wintergreen/mint.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

Beautiful appearance, one of the most truly creamy, densely compacted heads this side of the ""artificial"" nitro look.  Fun and enjoyable aroma, although admittedly a little mild and unfocused/disconnected.  Decent flavor balance (bit tart though), nice mouthfeel, although a little lighter bodied than the ABV would suggest.

Pours dark chestnut brown with a big tan head.  There are hints of hazy amber around the edges and lots of lacing.

Nose is dominated by rye and chocolate malts, and the malts are heavily roasted with the sweetness taking a back seat.  Nice and spicy character overall in the nose.

Taste has a sweeter milky lactose character up front which is backed up by a big roasted chocolate malt foundation.  Then theres the rye which is especially noticeable in the finish and leaves a spicy tingle on the tongue.

The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and crazy smooth which is to be expected with the heavy dose of rye.

2577,"2011-05-30",4.1,"Bottle. A dense, tow-finger beige head sits on top of an almost clear reddish brown body. Roasted malts dominates the aroma, but theres 
also dried fruits, some pleasant malty sourness, chocolate, alcohol hints and a good dash of piney hops. Its super-smooth in the mouth, full-bodied and a bit warming. Theres lots of flavors too, enough piney hops to deal with the sweet and roasted maltyness. Long bitterness in the else roasted finish. A wonderful beer I hope will be available on a regular basis in Norway. 110524","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
