A: Dark brown, creme color head, lacing. 

N: Tobacco, leather, smoke, peat, cocoa, burnt brown sugar, bacon, and more smoke. 

T: Very smokey and peaty. Moderately sweet.

M: Medium body, noticeable alcohol, spritzy carbonation. 

O: A much different rendition from Adam. Doesnt have quite the same body and intensity; this is more of an American Strong Ale. Still, pretty nice.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
2587,"2016-08-06",3.8,"Oddly, I had this after having the barrel aged version! Bottle thanks to Mick. Pours a mostly clear copper brown color with a small white head. A big sweet smoky nose. Sugary malty base, fruity, berries, big smoky malts. Hot, but drinkable. This is very different than the HOTD version, much more of a smoky barely wine. Hotter. Good.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
2587,"2016-05-07",3.8,"Bottle. Malty nose, caramel, chocolate, nuts, a bit of smoke. Nice, rich, malt. Reddish, dark brown, cloudy, with lace. Estery, malty, some smoke, caramel, apple, grapes, very bitter hoppy finish, peppery, prickly. A bit too bitter, actually, but that does help balance. Full, oily, light carbonation. Interesting, can see the family resemblance to Adam, but it needs a bit of work to get up there. Still, pretty fun.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
2587,"2016-03-13",3.6,"Adamu 10%

A mahagoney brown, looks nice. The nose has some peaty smoke and burnt brown sugar. Full bodied, sweet, oakey, some peat, malty. Pretty nice. Kind of muted.

Paired with a smores type cheesecake it brings out a malt caramel character. The 10% ABV is very well integrated though.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
2587,"2016-02-09",3.3,"Quite a nutty aroma, fig, soy sauce, bitter caramel, lingering notes of licorice, dried fruit, smoke, Islay with cola, fairly boozy finish. Meh, kind of a disappointment, maybe still too young, feels like peanuts and licorice in a strong whiskey coke...","","biirusaikou"
2587,"2016-02-06",3.8,"Bottle release, got mine, one of 1800, from Shinshu Osakemura. Pours dark brown, not really hazy but also not clear. No foam and very little if any carbonation. Aroma is sweetish, some roast malt, bitter chocolate and dark plums. Bit of booze coming through as well. Taste is slightly bitter at first, body feel a lot lighter than youd expect from a 10% beer, it is also quite dry and sweetness has been reduced into some raisin flavour, maybe bit of plums also. Hint of smoky leather and then just dry roast malt flavour that is actually dominating the aftertaste. Alcohol heat there as well, together with some smoky leather character. I think this beer really fits the style, it has definitely been aged for long, flavour profile is there and is quite enjoyable. I would have maybe appreciated a tad bit more of sweetness but I guess this dry character is a deliberate choice. from the part of brewers.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
2587,"2015-09-26",3.0,"100ml pour. Overtly sweet, caramelized sugar bomb. No real depth in flavour and really nothing like Adam. I cant see this being enjoyable on tap ever and would need some serious time in bottles. Not terrible, but not my kind of BW.","JAPAN","jonno"
2587,"2015-07-21",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2016 Re-rate: Bottle from Tanakaya. Big cherry nose, with some light oak and nuttiness. Body feels light and hides the abv very well. Very dry and lacking in sweetness. More berry flavors as it warms. Tasty stuff. On tap at Craft Heads. Deep brown pour with some ruby highlights and very little head. Strong nutty aromas with some milk chocolate and toffee along with a light bit of coffee, cherry and berry. Taste is more of the same with the nuttiness really coming out. This is fantastically complex with lots of fruit, spice and nut nuances towards the end as it warmed up. Slightly warming on the finish but overall fairly smooth. A great beer.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
2587,"2015-05-24",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2015 Aroma: Dark chocolate, light coffee
Flavor: Dry cola, nutty, cocoa.
Comment: Some heat kicks in after the nutty flavor arrives. I intentionally let this warm for 20 minutes as it was served overly chilled. The proper temperature really makes a difference.

2587,"2015-02-08",3.6,"slightly smokey with cherries and brownies. Smooth as hell. Malty. Cherries and wood, but flavors are not well integrated yet and this beer needs more time.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
2587,"2014-12-24",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2016 Tap at the Craftheads event. Dark, toffee and caramel, lots of fruit, smoke, thick. Light spice. Very nice. Boozy, cherry. Two years later and two years older at Gremlin. Mellow, rich, but the same flavours. Very smooth. Maybe a couple of extra points.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
2587,"2014-12-14",3.4,"Draft sampled at THE FESTIVAL 2014 in LA with Linh, Scarlett, GT & DTF. Pours a deep murky brown body with light off white lacing.

2587,"2014-12-14",3.9,"Draft at Craft Heads during the Shiga Kogen Tap Takeover event. Clear dark brown with off-white head. Aromas of roast, slight dark fruit, light chocolate. Tastes of roast, licorice, chocolate. Medium body with a dry finish. Nice one.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"
2587,"2014-11-23",3.7,"On tap @ The Festival 2014. Murky amber pour with a khaki head. Smoke is there, but fairly mild. Fair amount of caramel, some cherry, and grassy hops. Decent toffee and pine. A bit more smokey on the palate. Lots of caramel, toffee, and toasted grain. Nice pine and herbal bitterness. Some lemon zest, cherry skins, and plums. Nice.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

>> Murky brune pour, weaker foam. Nose is apple, weak. Taste is sweet cherry, lemon, sake like sweet rice alcohol note and pineapple, rich plum. Weak nose is a disappointment. Taste is actually very good, almost Belgian strong ale like. Didnt get any smoke or intense caramelization. Still, very fun to try.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
