3300,"2014-10-28",4.0,"First pour from the newly tapped gravity barrel at the brewery, Aug. 2014: Lightly hazed yellow. Creamy halo of lathery foam adorns the glass. Sophisticated nose of rich baguette, lemon, nectar, peach, herbs, minerals and potent sulfur. Fluffy and soft on the tongue. Initial surge of sharp minerals is enhanced by rustic sulfur chased by a softening push of lush and edgeless baguette pils malt and soothing hop oils. Fresh-picked hop pungency mirrors that of the sassy sulfur and mineralic vivacity. Pervasive yeasty rusticity vivifies the adeptly extracted haylike malt. Tongue-smacking, saliva-inducing hop succulence is well matched against the cracker dough and hay dust starches. Forceful punch of lemon zest and peppery hop bitterness is tempered by a splash of vibrant nectar in the luxuriously clean finish. Stefan might be a one-dimensional brewer (all five lagers in his portfolio are golden and centered around Hallertau and pils maltfine by me, since well-attenuated golden lagers speak the language of my heart), but the fact that he is churning out some of the cleanest beer in Franconia testifies to his masterful brewing skills. (4 / 8 / 4 / 8 = 4.0)


CO2 keg at Cafe Abseits in Bamberg, Aug 2014: Pale clear golden. Uneven collar of wispy foam. Clean but restrained aromas of lemon, minerals, baguette, vibrant peach and a hint of sulfur. Prickly and foamy carbonation. High in carbonic acid. Firm body. Lemony hop twang yields to a snappy pils-derived tastiness and bracing minerals. Rich and refined malt is matched by polished hop nectar and tongue-coating oils, which soften the mineralic onslaught. Hint of peachy esters sneaks in, as well. Dry finish is lined with lemony hop acids and flower nectar as well as fresh baguette and and honey-kissed hay. A respectable rendition, but completely forgettable when compared to the barrel pours fresh from the brewery. So much of the beers soul has been compromised by the ramped up gas levels in this keg pour, and consequently its quite flimsy and sour in the mouth. The bottle also fares similarly average.

3300,"2011-02-16",4.3,"Poured from a gravity cask at Churchkey during an event yesterday.

Pours a cloudy light yellow color with a pretty good-sized white head and nearly all-encompassing lacing as it went down. Nose brought good scents of light grain, hints of lemon citrus, and a bit of bread dough. The taste adds in some light fruity notes. Altogether, everything melds together quite well and while the flavors are very delicate, they are quite tasty. Feel is light with good carbonation; super crisp.

Drinkability was incredible. Prior to this, I hadnt had much experience with the style, so I thought I might have been overrating this at first. However, after quite a few other pours from different casks, it became clear that this was the best of the bunch and a great, great beer in its own right.

3300,"2007-08-14",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 15, 2007 Immense is not even an adequate descriptor for the sheer complexity found within. Astonishing would be an understatement for the surprising appearance, just loaded with an inch of sedimentary proteins at the bottom; large coagulated masses that give this the single most startling appearance, while still in the bottle, that Ive ever encountered. This is a simple unfiltered lager, right? Hardly. A slow pour leaves giant particulates behind, so what flows into the glass is a totally translucent, sparkling golden body with unkempt brassy hues. A thick, cloth-like white head adorns the top for most of the quaff, leaving behind sultry lacing in wide swaths as the glass drains. The nose is so elegant, an ultimately relaxing aromatic wave. Fresh grassy hops, also a touch fruity, lead in the aroma. Light notes of hay, ground cereal grains and strawberry fields follow. The yeast profile, though quite faint, is pristine and as fresh feeling as it typically seems on brew day. Overall the nose is very soft but expresses itself wonderfully and begs another long, contemplative inhalation. The flavor has a crispness and a resounding clarity I long for in a German Kellerbier. Bready notes take center stage and wage quiet battle with sweet caramel for the remainder of the taste for the dim spotlight. Sipping this, or gulping(as Im inclined to do, its absurdly drinkable), is a variational experience of sitting alone in the dark, captivated by a new experience thats both velvety and sublime. Graininess hinted at in the aroma is more profound here and in the finish, but never cumbersome, only a gentle comb though this oasis of grass. Herb notes join the hop-filled sprinkles that explode across the tongue, dispersing evenly and providing just enough bitterness to scatter a subtly coalescing sweetness. Acidic forays are nowhere to be found, this is unadulterated silkiness. The carbonation is wound up so tightly it could never be mistaken for anything but a natural occurence. The body is light-medium, fuller than beers that have typified the style for me in the past. Its uncompromisingly smooth, from the first tingle in the nose to the last drop that glides effortlessly down the back of the throat. The finish is glorified by what can only be a mineral composition in the brewing water that is the pinnacle of perfection, at least perfectly suited for this style of brewing, with these specific ingredients. A long and embracing finale leaves lush grassy notes and soft fruits behind, then its just a clean feeling that lingers on. A truly marvelous creation. There are better Kellerbiers in Franconia, but they are certainly far between and not found in this hemisphere. I could enjoy this every day, if only it were here for the taking.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

3300,"2007-02-28",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2007 Summer 2006 bottle consumed on 2/27/07Holy Christ, to think I almost missed this beers brief appearance in the States.  Thankfully Kai at the Wine Gallery pointed it out to me and I remembered it was supposed to be interesting.Well interesting is certainly an understatement.  The nose is the epitome of a crisp, dry, refreshing lager.  Beautifully extracted/attenuated pils malts in the nose provide dry honey and barley notes.  Very light nutty biscuits and then a strong shot of dry, zesty hops that hint at a little fruitiness and lots of fresh grass.  But what really seals the deal is the yeast signature on the end.  Light, fluffy and wonderfully biting/crisp, its every bit as refreshing as the best Czech pils.The appearance is as fresh as if it was poured from the tank;  bountiful, perfectly retained white head atop a sparklingly clear, gold-brass body.  Lots of protein break on the bottom, but it remains behind in the pour.  Tiny, naturally carbonated bubbles rise in the liquid.  Plenty of lacing cascades down the glass.Again, what hits you in the flavor is that same startingly clear, fresh crispness.  The combo of crisp, dry, flavorful hop, crisp, clean, zesty yeast and dry, flavorful, grainy malt is almost too much to take in.  For all of the crispness/dryness, however, it still maintains an ever-so-slight chewy-sweetness of rich honey, that helps prevent things from getting over-dried.  Incredibly tight, engaging carbonation just tingles softly on the tongue, giving a perfect mouthfeel.  Wow.  An elegant yeast, clean, fresh water and fabulous aroma/flavor hopping, not to mention the charming, rustic malts, make for one hell of a beer.  Tough to decide between this and Emersons Pils.  On one hand, Emersons is much hoppier, a little more chewy in texture and probably more a robust beer.  This is a bit more sessionable and has a bit more grainy/farmy maltiness.  I could live on those two beers alone.  This one even tops the Pikeland Kellerpils that I had on draught fresh, though not by a whole lot.  And lastly, taking in to account that this bottle sat warm for probably 7 or more months???

3300,"2006-05-24",4.0,"0.5L bottle.  Thanks Knut!  Light golden, clear, medium white head.  Good head retention.  Malty aroma with honey plus citrus/floral hops.  Nice malt flavor with distinct bitterness in the finish.  Slight dryness on tongue.  Great beer.","Austin, Texas, USA","DewBrewer"
3300,"2006-05-24",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2006 Impressions from the windowside:
-A veil of head surfs the golden sparkle.
-Virtuous citrus fruit freshen up the cereal and hay aplenty. Plantanes soon join the happy union.
-A pleasing herbal hop bitterness supports the ample maltiness.
-Yet another muscular yet kind-hearted body from the Franconian countryside, natural carbonation only helping.
-Great balance and coherence for this their house blond!
On tap at Café Abseits, Bamberg, and bottled back home.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
3300,"2006-05-19",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 23, 2009 Hazy gold. Huge, foamy, white head settles quickly and completely. Flavor and aroma of grainy malt, crisp hops, light fruit and floral notes, and bready yeast. Medium, balanced body. Easy drinking. Nice lager. [6,3,7,4,15=3.5. May 2006] Rerate 10/09: gravity pour at RedLight. Gold. White head. Crisp golden lager with herbal, grassy hops, a subtle malt and light colored fruit sweetness, and fresh grains. Clean, dry, mildly bitter finish. Excellent session lager. [current score].","Florida, USA","SoLan"
3300,"2006-05-16",4.1,"05.16.06  500ml bottle I just purchased today.  I guess I shouldve read the few reviews here before opening my bottle and filling the glass with the golden-yellow goodness as its obviously agitated and completely filled with clumps of stuff, and thats just the first half of the bottle...oh, boy.  Lacing is left behind immediately by the lofty, rocky, fading white head.  Fantastic aroma is part pils and part saison, and its just what the doctor ordered as I spend half an hour just hoping some of the precipitates will precipitate, but they dont.  Instead, it appears as if the gunk is suspended in time, resting motionlessly in what must be a somewhat viscous brew, and it is.  For such lightly colored beer, I expected less body and am pleasantly surprised by its considerable heft and silky smooth feel.  Aromas and flavors smack of grassy hops, lemon and citrus, french bread, fresh, and lingering sweet/bitter finish.  With temperature, a welcoming aroma of wet wool socks emerges.  Absolutely delightful beer, and just in time for summer!","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
3300,"2006-05-02",4.0,"Bottle. Pours a light golden yellow colour and is pretty thick and hazy with a persistent large fluffy white head and tons of floaties. Biscuit in the aroma along with sharp grassy hops, hay, and cookies - completely pleasing to the senses IMO. Very soft biscuit flavour with nearly no carbonation. Flavourful grassy hops though maybe not as pronounced as others in the style. Creamy yeast mouthfeel. This is truly top notch!

3300,"2006-04-25",3.5,"Not a lot of experience with this style...Not much head at all-yellowish, unfiltered-looks a lot like a hefeweizen. Aroma has a little apple, earthy hops, and wheaty breadiness. Flavor is very dry with subtle yet pervasive earthy, bitter hoppage,  sweet grain, and bready maltiness. Overall, this is quite decent-I just wish I had more to compare it to.","Pennsylvania, USA","beerbomb"
3300,"2006-03-26",3.7,"Green yellow, off-white creamy head.
Full-bodied fruity malt base, very nicely balanced with a broad hop profile.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","jonas"
3300,"2006-02-22",3.7,"500 mL bottle, newly arrived in america.  unfiltered, unpasteurized - no kidding.  move the bottle even gently and you disturb a thick layer of snowflakey sediment.  in fact, i think you could look at this beer the wrong way and disturb the sediment.  hoppy floral grassy aroma, but its thankfully married to a beautiful presence of pale malt.  the flavor goes about the same way, with a slightly surprising bitterness immediately followed by clean malt and the tangy signature of lager yeast.  a real ""farmhouse lager!""  $5 a bottle is not a bad deal at all.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
3300,"2005-09-19",3.3,"Draught  Yellow-gold beer, slight haze, fast receding white head. Malty nose, pale malts, slight herbal aroma - and honey! Bitterish initial taste on top of pale matls with very little restsweetness. Medium bodied  thanks to quite some malt filling. Gets sweeter in the aftertaste and overall in the long end. If ""lager"" meant this, I would love the style, no doubt.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
3300,"2005-03-13",3.2,"Tap, at Café Abseits in Bamberg. Jan 2005. Faintly hazy gold, moderate white head and gentle condition. Low sweet malt in the nose, hints of grain and sweet yeast in the mouth and a gentle but short grainy finish.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
3300,"2004-05-30",3.2,"Tap in Steinkrug. Street Imbiss in Schlüsselfeld. Malty hoppy flavor , in fact a good deal of flavor. more than aroma. Firm bitter aftertaste. Middle of the road lager with enough quality to make drinking this beer a pleasure.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
