The beer is fairly hazy and appears a crimson brown color. The aroma does indeed bring a healthy dose of blueberry muffins. Sweet berries, bread, lightly spiced. Hints of cinnamon. The beer is sweet and best suited for a small sample. Another well done gimic beer. Thin body. Definitely worth a try. Fun.

The taste has various fruitcake fruitiness rolling into winter spices like cinnamon as well as malty sweetness. The blueberries and some raisins really come through midway and into the finish.

Pours dark chocolate brown color with mahogany edges and a one finger yellowish beige head that quickly settles into a thin ring. Spotty lacing left behind. 

Another great smelling beer from Cigar City. These guys really nail the aroma on these dessert beers. It has the usual character of maduro with lots of roast and sweet malt notes but theres also some spice and a bready pastry presence. It really smells like a muffin with some blueberry sweetness that smells more organic than artificial. 

I love maduro so I was excited to see how the blueberry muffin characteristics would change the beer. It smells great but unfortunately, the flavor doesnt live up to the promise of the nose. The maduro elements are most prominent with a nice balance of sweet and roasted malt but the muffin/pastry character that was so interesting in the nose is barely noticeable. There is however some slight spice and a decent amount of blueberry flavor in the finish that provides some subtle sweetness. Another interesting experiment that Im glad to have tried but isnt as successful as some of the other maduro treatments.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Middle is touches of spice and dryness, touches of toast, crisp cereal, and dryness. Touches of toast, brown malt, dry hops, mellow tobbacco and a twang of blueberry fruit and skin. Interesting.
