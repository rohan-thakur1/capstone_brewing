Medium sweet flavour with notes of sugary chocolate, more baking cocoa, mild earthy bitterness. Full bodied with fine to average carbonation.

1678,"2016-02-25",3.8,"Draft at the brewery. Pours a nearly opaque coffee brown with small lasting beige head that settles into an island of film and a ring around the edge, leaving heavy lace in the glass. Notes of roasted malts, earth, cocoa, coffee, and tobacco. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a roasty, earthy, slightly bitter and sweet mouthfeel. Nice stout. Given the ABV, roastiness, and the fact that its not particularly dry, Im not sure its quite to style. But its good.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
