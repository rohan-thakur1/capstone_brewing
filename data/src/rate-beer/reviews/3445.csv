Het werd uitgeschonken in het festival proefglaasje uit een wijn decanteerder, slechts een half glaasje vol, wat natuurlijk het exclusieve imago verhoogd. Dikke olieachtige body, met weinig schuim, een kleine lichtbruine schuimkraag die snel wegtrekt. Aromas van chocolade, kaneel, koekjes, vanille, kokos, specerijen, sojasaus, donker fruit. Het smaakpallet is zeer complex en met een vol en olieachtig mondgevoel. Tonen van pure chocolade, zachte koffie, kokos, kaneel, vanille en een subtiele peper notitie, een geweldig complex bier. Zachte carbonatie, en een lange afdronk van kokos en lichte kruidige tonen. Prachtig bier om het geweldige Borefts festival 2016 mee te beginnen! Toch werden de torenhoge verwachtingen niet geheel ingelost, er waren 2 Imperial Stouts op dit festival die ik proefde die beter waren (deze waren wel BA overigens) Toch ben ik hard op zoek naar een fles van Cigar City Hunahpus Imperial Stout voor een meer uitgebreidere beoordeling in aroma en smaak notities.

The pour is a thick dirty motor oil black with a finger of dark mocha head that fades foam ring, leaving no lace behind. The aroma is beautiful. There is a ton of cinnamon in front of a light cocoa and a lot of vanilla. The chilies don't really dominate, but offer a good peppery spiciness that is incredibly well balanced. The cinnamon comes back and is delightful. I love the smell on this. The flavor is great. Copious amounts of cinnamon up front and they ease through a nice pepper transition into a soft cocoa and vanilla, before reentering the cinnamon realm. The fact that the chilies are reserved makes this so much better. The mouth feel is thick and viscous. Great carbonation help it just cling to the mouth in a never ending film. The aftertaste is all cinnamon and subtly it moves through a good chocolate and vanilla lingering finish. Damn good.

3445,"2015-07-29",4.6,"Originally reviewed 6/10/2011. 750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. As black as they come. Not even a hint of brown in the stream of the pour as it comes out of the bottle. It foams up nicely as I pour it with a dark brown head. The only thing thats missing is lacing, which is minimal. Unbelievable aroma. Deep dark chocolate. The friend I split it with said it smells like ""really expensive chocolate."" Roasty aromas abound with the chocolate and a slight burning in the nose from the alcohol and peppers. Delightful.
Taste is an immediate hop bitterness that fades immediately to a strong flavor of dark chocolate. The pepper flavor burns the taste buds just slightly throughout the entire drink, never allowing the sweetness to overwhelm. In the middle are the dark roasted malt flavors, followed by a finish that wants to be sweet, but cant overcome a hop bitterness and peppery bite.

Theres heavy and chewy, but this is ridiculous.One of the heaviest beer Ive ever had. Pretty high in carbonation considering the ABV and weight of the beer. Gives it a good tingle that complements the peppers nicely.

Pours a thick looking motor oil like colour, deep mocha head that also has oily looking legs, tiny lace spots, but not much. Nose is cinnamon, chilies, vanilla, surprisingly not much roasted malt that I would expect from the colour. It reminds me of my wifes chocolate chip cookies.

That could explain the heat factor as well. There is a fudge flavour as well as some dark fruits that contribute to the awesomeness. Its thinner than you would expect from the pour. Complex and well rounded. Glad I finally had this bad boy.","Dundas, Ontario, CANADA","Hammy78"

3445,"2015-05-13",4.8,"Bottle from last years Hunahpus Day, an event organized by Cigar City to deliberately hype this beer, to the example of Three Floyds Dark Lord Day (it cannot be a coincidence, by the way, that the label states that ""Hunahpu was tricked by the Dark Lords of the Underworld"" - this is doubtlessly an ironic nod to Three Floyds...). Makes me very curious to find out if it is worth the hype. Opaque black colour (revealing itself to be a very dark mahogany in the end) with high degree of viscosity, under a crackling, moussy, deep brownish beige head, almost reddish brown initially, steadily receding but retaining a thin rim around the edges. Very powerful and very seductive aroma, utterly complex, refinedly sweet, roasted and subtly spiced, first almost a dame blanche of chocolate sauce made with cognac poured over home-made vanilla ice cream, coffee liqueur, marzipan, sweet dried chili peppers clearly there, burning pipe tobacco, milk chocolate bars and Belgian chocolates, vivid accent of cloves and (strongly) cinnamon rolls, kahlua, cappuccino, eucalyptus, refined bourbon-like alcohol, cashew nuts, allspice, candied dates and cherries, subtle touch of meat broth... The basic and dense malts, hops and alcohol bouquet releases ethereal, volatile and beguiling sweet spice accents whenever it feels like it. What a fascinating smell... I can sniff it for hours. I cannot wait to take a sip, and must conclude that the taste follows the aroma perfectly: the expected dense candied sweetness opens the palate and makes my mouth water, candied fruits, with an almost refreshingly minerally sourishness coming from carbonation, which may perhaps be a little bit stronger than usual for the style, but fits in perfectly here. A soft and beautiful vanilla sweetness is apparent already early on, even strongly so, but I love vanilla so this is, to say the least, a welcome surprise. Very creamy, velvety, viscous, oily mouthfeel and obviously very thick body, revealing an abyss of malts, very chocolatey, nutty and caramelly, with a strong mocha bitterness after the middle, lively and not just from roasted malts, but an actual, powdery and refined coffee beans flavour. Cinnamon comes up retronasally along with that wonderful vanilla flavour, and then the finish evolves, with a big and thick lingering malt and candy sweetness, cloying even, aided by peppery hop bitterishness and of course warming, but nonetheless very gentle, liqueur- or rhum-like alcohol; the cinnamon and coffee stick to the throat, as a mixture of sweet, bitter and umami flavours, but given the immense complexity of this beer, it is hard to tell which ingrediënt causes which aftertaste... The ancho and pasilla chili peppers, both rather mild varieties, are there, but provide just a subtle burning touch in the back of the mouth and throat, without disturbing the overall balance; I do get their earthy, smoky, sweetish, peppery flavour though, only adding further complexity. This brew is indeed hugely complex and consists of layer upon layer of flavour, absolutely divine. It takes a lot of concentration - and a large bottle - to try and grasp what is going on in this one, and this is again a reminder of what beer as a beverage is capable of. This kind of top quality beers of utmost complexity move me. Yes, this is clearly worth the hype; this is an awe-inspiring imperial stout, managing to respect all the qualities of its style and building upon them an own personality; Im pretty sure I will recall this taste for the rest of my life. If it werent for the somewhat sticky, cloying effect in the back of the mouth and throat, Id give it a perfect score, which would have made it my very best beer so far. For now: just one inch away from being perfect.  But then, considering my previous experiences with this brewery, I did have high hopes for this, admittedly.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Pours a completely black, slightly viscous color, with a small, dark brown head.

Has rich aromas of chocolate, earthy, scorched malts, notes of molasses and a gentle coffee infusion, well balanced by unsweetened bakers chocolate.

Tastes of smooth, creamy chocolate, joined by toffeeish malts, evoking a mousse au chocolate impression, joined by a sweeter, calming, slightly wooden vanilla note. Has a hot peak, at first introduced by a decent hop bitterness, carried by a generous malt earthiness, transforming into a spicy, hot chili burn. This spiciness numbes the palate for a short glance, then revealing an interplay between a slick coffee bitterness and mellow, sweet chocolate. Finishes with a semi-dry aspect and cinnamon to it, including the taste of whole, burned coffee beans, dipped into hot chocolate. Burning, hot Jalapeno and cinnamon are sticking on the outside of my teeth, accompanied by a subtle sweetness. The balance of this brew is outstanding, regarding its complexity. There are no moments in which any off-flavors get revealed, or in which the beer turns into something odd, but its full body is defined by a great smoothness and diversified taste.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3445,"2014-11-23",4.4,"I try not to get caught up in the hype of beers like Cigar City Hunahpus Imperial Stout that are only released once a year on a special day at the brewery for which you need to buy tickets in advance (i.e. Dark Lord, Kate the Great, etc.). But since two friends of mine in Florida were generous enough to send me a bottle of the last two editions, I figured it was okay to get a little excited. And now that Ive tried the beer I can definitely see why it receives the praise it does. This is a very unique and impression imperial stout brew as it utilizes a variety of spices and flavorings to give it a taste youre not going to find in any other beer of the style. Its not quite world class, but it is damn good.

NOTE: The scores are indicative of the 2014 vintage.

The 2013 vintage was given to me by Christopher G. and the 2014 vintage was given to me by Matt S. Thanks to both of my friends for sending me these beers! I split each bottle with four friends. We poured them into various stemmed tulip glasses and goblets. 

Appearance: Both vintages are, not surprisingly, completely opaque black and a very dark shade of black at that. Both had a dark brown, frothy head, though the 2013s was slightly lighter. Both heads faded relatively quickly and only left a little bit of lacing.

Taste: My friends and I started out with the 2014 edition, which at the time of drinking was an 11-month-old bottle. Right away there was a huge sensation of dark baking chocolate  intensely bitter, but also rich with chocolaty sweetness. Dark cherry and other fruit flavors are prominent as well, probably likely derived from the use of massive amount of malt in the brew (a lot of imperial stouts tend to have similar characteristics). On the second half, a strong surge of cinnamon spice sweeps across the palate  creating for a Christmas cookie-like taste. As it goes down, theres a warmth from the peppers, though I would not consider it spicy in a peppery way. All in all its quite delicious, though a bit repetitive. Id probably prefer a touch more sweetness, but whats here is extremely pleasant.

The 2013 edition was noticeably different. The pepper character had faded, though the chocolate component had not only strengthened, but gone from bitter dark chocolate to sweet milk chocolate. The alcohol was also a bit more pronounced, ironically enough, though it did create for a slightly smokey, bourbon-like flavor. Cinnamon was still quite potent on the finish, though it was more a sweetness than a spice. It left a residual cloying/sticky sensation which is common for many imperial stouts. I dont think anything was gained by aging this vintage, in fact, it was probably hindered a bit since the spicy character was weakened (though if you dont like spice, cellaring a bottle is the way to go).

Drinkability: It was clear right away that both of these beers were pretty beefy. I believe the 2013 edition was 11% ABV and the 2014 was 11.5%, though neither had any kind of extreme quality to their weight. The mouthfeels were, of course, full-bodied, but with a soft texture and smoothness as it went down. Not much in the way of alcohol warmth, though the fresher vintage definitely had some noticeable heat from the peppers (but again, nothing too extreme). The 2013 vintage traded Scoville heat for alcohol heat and it was actually rather cloying in the aftertaste whereas the 2014 was remarkably dry. Im glad I split these bottles with friends, though I was certainly feeling the weight of the brew bearing down on me afterwards. Splitting a bottle with friends and family is definitely the way to go.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

First taste is of the spices, with cardamon coming first, followed by a bit of cinammon, molasses and just enough chillies to be notable but not to burn, at least not initially - there is a soft burnijg on the back of the throat. Really nice with the condiments offering something different.

Before picking up the glass even, its fair to say that this is an older bottle. Pretty much pitch black color, thin light brown head. Some loose splotches of lace. Some good legs, a nice film on the glass. Good spicy cocoa peppery aroma. Moderate to bigger bitter taste, moderate to bigger sweet. Light kick. Bigger body. Chewier, thicker, creamier carbonation. More dry finish. Lighter carbonation. Awesome, spicy, complex imperial stout. Good thick chewiness to this. Very nice to try.

3445,"2013-12-24",4.4,"Vintage 2011

A: Pours obviously quite thick - crude oil. Broken, dark mocha foam coats the surface and then dissipates nearly immediately. No residual foam. No lacing. The beer coats the walls of the glass and tans the window.

S: Plenty of vanilla. Plenty of earthy and spicy chiles. The ancho chiles are more evident than the pasillas, but nonetheless, the chile is there. Anise and licorice notes are also there, and IMO, more prominent than the cocoa. 

T: Dark chocolate truffles laced with salt, chile and vanilla. Decadent. Very sweet and sticky. The beer is not particularly complex, but the ingredients are fairly balanced in here. Ive read that the chiles are the fastest dying aspect of the beer - Ill buy that. The cocoa is at the forefront of the beer, but the chiles offer the counter to the sweetness albeit subtly. The vanilla flourishes in the ol factory aspect of the palate. Theres bitterness which is predominated by the malts IMO. 

M: Sticky, tacky, viscous, chewy. I really cant use enough adjectives to describe how thick and alive this beer feels. The thickness is only interrupted by the fine, sharp carbonation. Theres no visual indication that this beer has carbonation, but the feel is spot on the for the style. Finish is dry and mouth watering. 

O: Theres no question this is a fantastic beer. Does it live up to the hype? Almost. A little more from the chiles and I would say yes. I cant see the benefit of aging this in barrels. The bottle size is a bit too much for one, but would be great for four folks as a digestif.

Dark chocolate and vanilla are the dominant aromas, however the chiles make their presence known the more the beer warms.

Tastes lean a bit toward the sweeter side, which I usually dont like, but it never became cloying. Good flavors of rich dark chocolate dominate the palate. A touch of vanilla and oak as well. Chiles werent detectable until it warmed to room temp, but then asserted their presence to add some complexity without overpowering anything else. Very good balance.

Viscous and thick without becoming cloying. Carbonation level was fairly low.

A- Poured into HF stemware, pours jet-black with a thin mocha head that quickly fades to a thin ring around the glass. Appears to be very thick, almost syrupy, with very low carbonation. 4.25

S- Vanilla beans up front followed by unidentifiable spices, cherries, chocolate, several fruit esters I cant pick up, with a slight alcohol undertone. Extremely complex and enjoyable. 4.75

T- Chocolate that is quickly overtaken by a strong, yet not overpowering chili flavor that gives way to marshmallow-like vanilla, cinnamon, and a complementing roast malt. There is a lingering bitterness, it seems like it is more from the malt than hops though. 4.5

M- Low carbonation that is barely present, a full body with a long bitter note mixed with the heat from the peppers. 4.5

O- This beer is definitely better around 50-55 degrees. All of the flavors seem to pop more and meld to make an incredible beer. I dont know if I could drink much more than 12 ounces of this in a sitting, but it is very enjoyable, and one of the best Russian imperial stouts I have consumed thus far.

Elements arent so layered here; everything feels well integrated but each sip is very similar and it does get a bit tiring. Massively thick and oily mouthfeel. The only drawback of the hugeness is that its tough to work through. Oh, and I couldnt really detect cinnamon at any stage, but theres just so much going on here that Ill forgive it.","Cheshire, ENGLAND","Nocturne"

Taste vanilla, cocoa, cinnamon and a good amount of spices. Love it. 2011- pour motor oil black. I was surpise 2011 did not have a punch of spices as 2010. The nose did have alot of vanilla. Taste was Choc, cinnamon and vanilla. 2012- pour black. Aroma was of more cocao and vanilla. Spices did come back but it was not as much. 2012 also has a peppery flavor to it as well. 2013- still very much fresh had all the aroma. Cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla, heat from the peppers and it tasted as such. Over all I think the Hunahpu beers is fantastic and if you can get your hand on a bottle get one.

Taste is a mix between some deep chocolate notes with light cinnamon and vanilla a with some residual sugar notes with dry bitter notes subtle finish. Body is full with limited filtration and with a smooth texture with almost motor oil-like consistency. Extremely complex while retaining a good level of drinkability.

3445,"2013-04-17",4.7,"Sweet merciful lord, Ive been looking forward to this for ages. Thanks to a BA for sending me this bottle in what I initially thought was a lopsided trade. Now I feel like things were pretty even in the end. Shared with two fine Dallasites on a muggy Tuesday evening. 

Roughly 6 oz. pour into a tulip/snifter hybrid glass. This beer is darker than the night outside the house. Rich brown head sits just over a centimeter high atop the completely opaque liquid. As I lift the glass to hold it up to the light, hearty legs are already forming where the beer has moved about the glasswares surface. Absolutely beautiful.

Smell is quite strange given the labels description. While vanilla and cinnamon and rich, rich chocolate are all highly evident, our small group also perceived a rather herbal aroma. This likely was caused by the peppers used in the brew, but is still a bit unexpected. Strangely, though, this odd addition doesnt negatively affect the overall aroma. Instead, it adds one more dimension to the already apparent complexity.

First sip is a full assault on my taste buds. Wow. What an incredible rush of flavor. There is so much vanilla, cinnamon, milky chocolate, unsalted caramel, and gentle pepper sweetness that Im momentarily confused. After allowing a few moments to process, I realize this is one of the best beers Ive had the privilege of drinking. The richness is unparalleled.

The texture and feel of this beer is exquisite. Even at 11% ABV, the brewers have achieved a balance between a sweet, sipping beer and a dry, sessionable brew. Theres a viscosity here that Ive rarely, if ever, experienced. After the first taste, I imagined some Exxon Valdez-like tanker had capsized on my tongue, leaving a slick that would maim any seals, pelicans, or mouth-based marine life. I know from the amount of heartburn Im experiencing today that I should never session this, but I am convinced I could take on an entire bottle by myself and have no regrets. 

That was pretty wordy, so Ill sum it up in a sentence fragment: obtain at any cost.","Texas, USA","bootsjohn"

A - Pours a pitch black body with two fingers of dark mocha foam. Settles down quickly and sits still after a few minutes. Moderate lacing with weak retention. Swirling does coat the glass in a thin brownish yellow film.

S - Starts off with roasted char and just a phenomenal chili aroma. It doesnt smell spicy or burnt or over the top, just delicious chili peppers sans the heat. Sweet vanilla, chocolate and earthy cinnamon really work to balance things out on the end. Has a sort of ""faux-cinnamon flavored coffee flavored drink"" thing going on, but in a good way. Really complex with a lot of different elements working seamlessly together.

T - Very roast dominant, and reminiscent of Founders RIS in the beginning. However things start to get complicated when the vanilla, cinnamon, and chocolate take over. On the very end is some subtle roasted chili flavor and even further back is a slight burn of the tongue. For some reason I was expecting something spicier, not the case as this is beyond approachable. All the flavors are present and just meld together. Medium bodied and creamy. Alcohol is very well hidden.

Very little carbonation. Finishes bittersweet, keeping it far from cloying. Chiles help too. But in any case it is dessert on its own.

Got a chance to try the 2014 version from a generous sharer in line at the Swamp Head Bottle Drop.  Thanks!  Pours as before, but this years really has more cinnamon, vanilla, and chile notes than the 2013.  I noted this in the DB Huna as well.

Something slightly vegetal creeps in at the end, but theres no denying the clear announcement that this is a thick, chewy, stout.

3445,"2012-10-18",4.1,"I shared this guy at the Pre-DLD tasting. 750 ml bottle served, 2012 vintage in a Deschutes tulip. Had this side by side with the 2011 and Bourbon barrel aged versions. Huge thanks to Eric (Holland) for hitting this long time want.

A: Pours a jet black body with dark khaki head forming on the pour. This stuff is viscous. Some splotchy lace is left down the glass.

S: Roasted malts, some sweet chocolate and a nice subtle spice are present in the nose. The nose is a tad boring considering what there is in this beer.

T: The taste is much better. Nice spiciness from the chilies and there is a touch of some cinnamon. Dark chocolate, some figgy fruit notes and some roasted malts round it out.

M: Chewy and thick. The carbonation is on the lower end there is a residual heat from the chilies.

O: A very solid beer. The 2011 vintage definitely lost some of the luster and complexity that the 2012 had. This is a stout that must be drank fresh if you want to retain any of those flavors from the spices and the chilies.

3445,"2012-09-20",4.7,"Sampled initially at Tryst in Delray Beach, also have a few bottles that will be sampled in the future

From Notes:

A: Absolutely amazing pour. Ominous pitch black oil, huge deep brown head (almost purple), retention is surprisingly good given the ABV

S: Complex to say the least. Chocolate, fudge, vanilla, coffee, lactose, cinnamon, and dark fruit to name the main notes. Overall sweet smelling, but definitely has lots of depth

T: As I suspected, a sweet beer, and alcohol is pretty well hidden. Vanilla, fudge, chocolate, coffee, and cinnamon come the the front. I never really picked up on the peppers, but then again, there is so much going on.

MF/O: Thick and oily feel to it. Smooth and creamy despite the moderate carbonation.

Overall, a stout that should be grouped in with the best, but I never really got that ""wow"" factor that I was expecting. I still prefer the Abyss and KBS over Hunahpus, but lets see what some cellaring does to this","Parkland, Florida, Florida, USA","scottyshades"

The aroma was all sorts of great, cocoa, vanilla, cinnamon, roasted malts. Taste is fantastic, but the chilies got lost in this version. That being said, the rest of what I smelled was all there, well balanced, with the alcohol very well hidden. I want a bottle all to myself now. Lived up to most of the hype, just wish the chilies came through more. Have now tried the verticals of 2010 through 2013.

The head is sooooo thick, creamy and erotic. The aroma doesnt show off, but got lots of chocolate and leather. The taste is massive chocolate and roasted malts followed up with some awesomely delicious spicyness. Vanilla and cinnamon works so well with the chocolate.

Stunning! Aroma of dark chocolate, cocoa beans, dark dried fruits, cinnamon, sweeter liquorice, rear cigar, vanilla, a note of leather also and some weak spicy/earthy notes. Taste is more roasted and the chili really strikes through in the aftertaste in a pleasant way. Also followed by the cocoa beans, chocolate, liquorice, weak tobacco, alcohol in the back of your throat. It also has that salty quality to it, some espresso notes and dark dried fruits here aswell. Big and full of inspiring nuances! Really diggin the chili in the end featuring the creamyness!

The aroma brings a potent dose of roasted malt, alcohol, chiles, cocoa, vanilla. Wow, this beer smells fantastic.

Unbelievably well-balanced and teeming with flavor. Simply amazing. The chiles have a big presence in the beer, but dont put out an overabundance of heat or spice. Masterfully done there. Cinnamon, vanilla, and oak meld beautifully with a full-bodied, roasty stout.

3445,"2012-04-26",4.1,"2011 Bottle.  Pours oil black with dark tan head that holds up pretty well. Smell is roasted dark malts, bitter chocolates,  tobacco, and spice.  Taste is chocolate, coffee still reasonably strong, and the chili hides in the back but is certainly there.  Other notes of vanilla and tobacco.   Not sure if there are still hops hanging around, the chilis or the bitter chocolate, but there is certainly a hanging bitterness. While this was good and the chilis certainly put it in a category of different, very good.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"

3445,"2012-04-08",4.1,"I brought this one to stakems fish fry. One of my personal favorites, this particular bottle was from the original release.

A - Pours jet black with a nice one finger tall tan head leaving small, thin trails of lace down parts of the glass.

S - Smells of chocolate, chill spice, dark roasted malt, coffee grounds, tobacco and a tiny bit of vanilla. This one has muted quite a bit from when it came out.

T - Starts off with a ton of dark roast quickly giving way to a mix of dulled chocolaty sweetness, day old coffee grounds, light chili spice and some wet tobacco. Not as muted down as the nose is, still very nice. A touch of booze comes in at the finish, combining with some of the dark roast to linger on the pallet for some time.

M - This is definitely a big beer. It has lost some of its trademark spice over the years in the bottle but it still has a nice thick body and bold flavors with a good amount of carbonation.

O - This one was definitely showing its age. When fresh, this beer is nearly impossible to beat. I will never turn down a glass of this beer. It is truly one of the best stouts out there.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

3445,"2012-03-01",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2012 From notes.  First reviewed 1/31/2011.  Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a pint glass.

This pours out jet black viscous liquid.  There is almost no head to speak of.

Dark chocolate, vanilla, espresso, a dark blend of smoothly roasted malts, and chocolate malt are all present.

I really enjoyed trying this in the same sitting as the Marshal Zhukovs. The flavors in each beer are so smooth and complex, it is no wonder that Cigar City has a great reputation. Dark chocolate blends with dark roasted malt and a bit of espresso to start the sip. More chocolate continuously comes through as the sip progresses, with a darker and more bitter roasted malt to accompany it. A touch of chile and heat come through right at the end. The aftertaste is somewhat bitter and chocolaty.

Absolutely velvety smooth, with great depth of flavor. The body is extremely full, with lots of creamy carbonation. Lightly sticky sweet, but not overly so. 

This is pretty awesome, it definitely lived up to my expectations. Since we were drinking the 2010, the flavors and aromas had really blended together nicely. This created a very smooth transition between the different aspects of the flavor, but it also made some of them difficult to isolate or taste. I only got a very mild heat from the chiles, and I could not get any hint of cinnamon. Definitely looking forward to this years release.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3445,"2012-02-03",4.8,"Reviewed way back in 2009 from a bottle that was hand bottled from a growler.  This was before the beer was released in bottles.   I popped the cap off and was greeted by a nice pffft.  I was worried that when I opened this beer that to much air would of gotten to it and ruined the experience.  No sir it was perfect.  The beer poured thick and black.  A huge creamy tan head poured.   This beer poured perfect.  The smell on this beer is fantastic.  Deep chocolate malt, vanilla, smokiness, and spice.  Yup spice.  A nice amount of cinnamon and chili pepper.  It hits the nostrils but doesnt overwhelm.  Not to much of a burn.  Definitely a unique aroma that you dont usually get from a stout.

The taste on this beer is just amazing.  So much going on.  Really complex.  The taste happens in waves.  Up front is the chocolate and vanilla.  Its sweet and slightly bitter.  Next up is the smokiness and roasted malt.  Then the spices hit.  They just sit on your tongue.  When I first sipped this brew the spices werent to noticeable.  But as you take sip after sip the hotness starts to sit there.  Not overwhelming though like some other beers Ive had.  Finally there is a bit of a bitter ending from the hops.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","drunkenpolack"

Appearance :Pitch black with small dark brown head.

Aroma : Big chocolate with hot peppers. Nice vanilla too. Very rich.

Taste : Hot peppers with chocolate, some coffee. Lots of hops. Finish is long, persistent and rather sweet. Lots of chocolate and coffee. Lots of hops also. Rather bitter also.

Overall : This is one big beer. Very sweet and very rich. Bitterness helps balancing out some of the sweetness but its still pretty sweet. We were only two on this and I had a hard time finishing it. Very nice mix of chocolate and hot peppers both on nose and taste. Only reason why Im not rating this higher is because its a bit too sweet and it gets very cloying.

3445,"2011-06-15",5.0,"Perfection!

Received this bottle from Chairmissing and I cant thank him enough!

A: The darkest, thickest beer Ive seen to date. Decent carbonation.

S: Coffee, chocolate and vanilla.

T: Let me start by saying I came into this beer very skeptical. I never believe the hype behind beers but this left me speechless. I let the bottle sit for about 20 minutes after taking out of the fridge, poured into a snifter. The first taste was strong chocolate and alcohol with a interesting aftertaste. As it warmed the cinnamon and chili became quite apparent. The strong chocolate hits first then some malt and to finish it off the chili hits the back of the tongue simply amzing and this is now the most complex beer Ive ever had.

O: Cant describe how much I love this beer. There is no way I will miss the release next year. I wouldnt trade away the cellar to try it but if you have a friend near the brewery or someone offering you a bottle for a decent trade definitely do it.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","alpar"

Aroma is fantastic; chocolate and roast are very potent, cocoa, and sweet chocolate, almost get a note of fresh baked dense chocolate cake, caramel and molasses, vanilla.  Some hop bitterness, spicy note from the chilies, cinnamon, somewhat earthy.  

Pours like used motor oil, completely opaque, I cant even see through the stream as I pour into the glass, nice tan head which is thicker than I presumed such a beer could support, retention is only a minute or two before subsiding to a thin ring of foam.

Flavor starts off with a load of sweet chocolate and roast; the roast flavor is pleasant and mellow, not at all puckering or astringent.  Caramel and cocoa, toffee, molasses, dark sugars and some dates, dark roasted coffee, nice vanilla presence.  Cinnamon really shows up once the chocolate and roast have a second to dissipate, slight flavor from the chilies, but they show up more in the form of a nice warmth in the finish.

The flavor is big on dark fruity plums, raisins, cherry and lots of semi sweet dark chocolate.

The cinnamon still shines through very nicely. It has just a touch of soy and ashy roasted malt in the finish. This was a real treat just for the wonderfully rich chocolate character.

3445,"2011-04-05",4.2,"This one has some hype to live up to.

Pours dead black with the most amazing cocoa head ever.

Smell is a bit off-putting. Nothing inviting here, bitter, dark hops and/or cacao.

Taste is COMPLEX. Getting cacao beans, and a healthy cinnamon burn which is amazing. Coffee roast coming through as well. Not getting a ton of vanilla. Did I mention Cinnamon and chile burn?

Wow, this is a wonderful taste. I love cinnamon and chocolate combined and this is the best of all worlds - Cinnamon, chocolate and BEER! But it works. This reminds me of the descriptions of ancient Aztec hot chocolate drinks back when the cacao bean wasnt the invention of Milton Hershey.

Not much else to say. Not going to be a favorite if you dont like new things. :) I love this - though I cant see drinking it all night.","Pennsylvania, USA","radioscooter"
3445,"2011-04-04",4.8,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2012 [Bottle, thanks so much for the trade!] Pours black with a very dark brown head. Aroma is spiced chocolate cake, apple crisp, vanilla, rounded fruitiness (reminds me of banana, but not quite the same). Taste has the cinnamon again, apple, chocolate, and pepper comes out as it warms. Really integrated beautifully though, as the heat is in the background and just compliments the other flavors instead of overpowering them. A little ashy in the finish, but fairly subdued. A little thinner than the Zhukov, but still very thick. Smooth, and has a long finish. Outstanding imperial stout, in fact, one of the best that Ive ever had. Very unique, and everything worked for it. Thanks again!I still crave this beer quite regularly, so it is getting bumped up a point. I need to trade for some of this!","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"

The pepper isnt present at all in the aroma, and its predominantly spice and chocolate.  Flavor is very similar with plenty of chocolate and cinnamon that pair very well with one another.

Nose has some chocolate and vanilla, but I could not get the peppers.  Taste was similar to Marshal Zhukov, but without as much soy sauce taste as is prevalent there.

3445,"2011-03-31",4.4,"Received this bottle in a trade -- thanks. Poured into a snifter. Beer is noticably thick as I pour, leaves legs on the sides of the glass. Beer is pitch black, black black. You cant see through it at the corners to through the thinnest part of the beer. Its just not happening. Forms a brown head, overall thin of smallish to medium sized bubbles and it leaves some lacing on the glass - although I think the alcohol is hindering the lacing overall.

The aroma is surprisingly spicy. I can get some alcohol, very slight, but I can definitely smell some chilis. This makes me nervous slightly but not too. The more I smell the more subtle characters of sweetness and a slight chocolatey bitterness come through. Smells good.

Beer is full bodied in the mouth. There is not a spicy / chile flavor as I was expecting in the beer after the initial aroma. There is a lot of roast in the back of the palate and nice carbonation / connectivity on the palate. There is some sweetness up front and nice chocolate based / roast based bitterness on the trailing end. No aftertaste to note and drinkability is high. I enjoyed it. It was complicated and some of the complexity is lost by the size but overall a very good stout.

The aroma is on the lighter side but its vey complex, wish it was a little more robust. There is so much going on here, on the front roasted malts, almost smokey, then small notes of vanilla, and cocoa. The smoke might also be presenting as light ancho chiles. 

The taste is pretty good, lots going on as well. Lots of roasted malts on the front, cocoa nibs that are incredibly sweet with a hint of the chiles, very nice and unique. The finish is super sweet. Great to have a stout that isnt dominated by coffee, theres no coffee at all and its refreshing.

3445,"2011-03-19",4.3,"Pours as black and dark as a beer can get. Even the stream was opaque. It was slow to produce a head, fearing it was flat, I poured with a little more vigor. It started a thin, extremely dark brown ring of foam, which then puffed up a full 2 finger thick layer of brown cream, but it faded fast, leaving only modest lacing - though it does leave an oily brown film in the glass when you swirl it around. Aroma is surprisingly restrained, it shows quite a bit of roast, worcestershire sauce, maybe a little chocolate or vanilla. Flavor starts with a full roasty and chocolate sweet front, leads to a sweet and spicy finish, with distinct cinnamon tones lingering through the aftertaste. I liked this slightly better on draft at the brewery on release day, as it had a better palate with a soft push of creamy carbonation, like all of their impies had. But I didnt otherwise have a rateable sample that day, this rating comes the bottle (2011 version). Over time in the glass, the aroma seems to liven up a little, shows more cinnamon and pepper spice. There is a light earthy fruitiness to this (aroma and flavor) that I think might come from the peppers. Last, for as big and complex as this is (its really big, and theres alot going on) it is surprisingly balanced and each component has its place. Funny, if I was to give this a more technical BJCP style rating, Id probably give it a perfect score - this may be a first for me where the hedonic score comes in a little lower. That is not to say its not pleasing, just maybe a little overwhelming.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

4.0 A: Pours a syruppy black color. Two fingers of creamy dark brown head with about average retention and some spotty lacing.

5.0 S: Wonderful nose. Right up there with the best of them. Complex with all the aromas collaborating. Sweet milk chocolate is by far the most prominent aroma. Blackstrap molasses, lots of toffee, some coffee, dark crystal malts. Plenty of roasted barley and toastiness to balance, but the sweetness still dominates. Vanilla is subtle and in the background. I may be detecting the cinnamon, but Im not sure. Cant tell theres a chile in there though.

4.5 T: Sweet chocolate is most prominent again. Black coffee and roasted barley team up to give this an equally forceful roastiness and bitterness. Vanilla bean is subtle again, but definitely there. I definitely picking up the chiles now and they add a vegetal character, but Im glad there arent stronger. The only problem I have with this beer is that the alcohol isnt well hidden.

5.0 M: Heavy body with a silky creaminess to it. Good moderate carbonation. Thick, smooth, and silky is the way I like my Imperial Stouts and this meets all my requirements.

4.5 D: Very tasty beer with a wonderful nose and great mouthfeel. This is definitely the real deal. Time for another ISO.

3445,"2011-01-01",4.3,"Weird, somehow my rating disappeared for this:
Sampled March 2010
A vigorous pour produces a very, very dark brown colored head that is four-fingers in height and just crests the rim of my 25cl tulip glass.  The beer is inky, perfectly black and remains opaque and black in hue even when held up directly to the light.  The aroma smells of a restrained mix of cinnamon, dark chocolate, vanilla, espresso, and roasted fruit, all the while being quite huge; meaning the aroma on this is quite over the top big, but there is a lot of competing complexity without the individual components not being in balance with each other.  There is a touch of a salty, maybe peat smoke like character that seems to be a combination of rich, umami laden dark malt, perhaps some chipotle like notes (which is strange that this beer smells faintly of these smoked chiles when none are included in the recipe) and some general spiciness that is more wood-like than anything from the chiles.  Roast malt character plays a big role here, but this is not nearly as big and unbalanced in its roast character as one might expect for a beer of this color.  The roast character seems a touch chalk-like at times, but is incredibly smooth, with ample toasted whole grain character in addition to the mellow, deep roasted grain component.  Ah, there is actually a hint of peppery chile, seems almost like green chiles at times; this last might be induced somewhat by the roasted malt.  The vanilla is almost the most subtle ingredient in the nose, but the chiles seem to be quit subdued too; though I think some of the fruit character comes from the chiles.  As the beer warms up more the alcohol becomes more noticeable and actually increases the burnt vegetal note just a bit too much unfortunately, but also compliments a peppery note that does work.  And on closer inspection, the green note is not so much the green, burnt broccoli like note that some stouts have, but rather it is a bright, green bell-pepper like note that is really not objectionable; my wife thinks it smells like fresh cut green vegetables.

Thick, viscous and creamy as it first hits my palate, but some carbonation lightens things up just a hint.  Huge roast malt flavors dry the finish out just a touch with some chalky notes, charcoal bitterness and a dry, rich dark malt character.  Surprisingly this is not as sweet as something this sweet seems like it should be; the roast character helps with this, as does a really rich, darkly complex malt character, some smoky grain notes, evoked flavors of peat and the sea (with an almost salty quality), dark cocoa notes, and an Ethiopian full-city roast coffee quality that is quite nice.  Rich fruit notes lurk just below the dominant roast character, suggesting flavors of black-berries, a big blueberry note that almost seems shocking, roasted dried fig flavors as well as some roasted prune like notes.  The chocolate character is big (well actually it is huge) here as well, one definitely finds a rich dark chocolate character, though it makes me wonder how much is from the base beer versus the added cocoa nibs.  Some spicy, peppery flavors start to emerge as this really warms up.

I like that this is thick and lush without being so cloyingly sweet.  Rich, berry-like, dried chile, ancho flavors start to become more noticeable as this warms up as well.  I like that the chile flavor serves a sort of ""hop-bitterness"" like role to this beer, it is fairly subtle to this particular chile-head, but I like the hint of subtle heat it adds as well as the touch of fresh chile character that is found in the finish.

I was fully prepared to not like this (though truthfully I was fully prepared to like it too), but I definitely do.  It is quite well balanced, much more than I was expecting and truthfully I would have liked a touch more ancho and pasilla character (speaking of which, does this mean that both dried pasillas (aka ancho chiles) and fresh pasillas where used here, or are this two distinct chiles in the Florida / Cuban culture?), but in the end this would have brought the so carefully crafted balance of this beer a bit too far off.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3445,"2010-12-29",4.3,"My second time having this. Shared by a local BA on 09.23.2010. First batch (2010).

Jet black with one of the meanest chamiosee colored head Ive seen. Theres nothing less exciting than talking about the color brown, but this is one heck of a dark brown. 

The bottle was shaken the day before to maximize the chile presence. Cocoa powder, bittersweet chocolate, and chilies dominate. I think whats most absent, actually, is the coffee. The cinnamon, while faded, still provides some nice balance to the cocoa, and the peppers come through on the finish with a warming kick. 

Thick and chewy, Hunahpus delivers. As much as I dislike reading the description of this because of how over the top it sounds, this is a great stout.

3445,"2010-12-17",3.8,"Giving this one a 2nd chance; oily black, trace dark brown head; dry pepper, chocolate, oranges, lemons; very thin texture; big time roasted malt and dark chocolate; pepper not nearly as overpowering here as before; almost lime too; much better this time, but still not something I can drink too much of; texture is thin, oily and rich; more texture would help my impression

Original Rating 6/10/10 (Score - 3.5): 750 ml bottle; thanks Ibrew3or3 for bringing to Seattle!! Pours dense black with trace tan head; chaulky aromas of pepper, burnt malt and chocolate; quite harsh to me on first sip with ashy pepper and astringency spice; I really dig the nose in this one, but pepper and chilies are a little off putting to me; dry, ashy mix of peppers and chocolate; Im kind of a wuss when it comes to spicy food, so not that unexpected that its a little much for me here; Ive read that Zhukov is again the base here and while I love that beer, the treatment here (like the humidor version) doesnt work for me; got another bottle that Ill put some age on to see if the pepper fades a little bit","Seattle, Washington, USA","SuzyGreenberg"
3445,"2010-12-11",4.2,"Bottle - thanks Dave.  The pour is what I love in an impy; silky dark brown, near black and two fingers of creamy brown head.  Looks delicious.  Nose is roasty, chocolate, and espresso.  Mouthful is silky and smooth, slightly oily.  Taste is rich with the chocolate, dry roast, slightly smokey, and I just ever so slight sense the chili peppers hit the back of my tongue.  Seamless transition of flavors.  Thick sheets of sticky brown lacing.  Badass brew.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
3445,"2010-12-07",4.6,"Appearance: pours like sweet lovely delicious motor oil. Espresso crema head fades fast into a thin ringlet. Swirls with black tears and a slightly thicker collar. No head. None.

Nose: thick, tar, and char. Vanilla beans, raw chilies tickle the back of my nose. Burnt black cacao and espresso sludge. Wisp of melted cream. Cinnamon is a shadowy whisper here, there, and than none at all.

Palate: for such an intensely thick pour his mouthfeel is amazingly soft, velveteen, and creamy. Immediately coats lips in burnt caramels and cinnamon and black chocolate all melted into one. Long chocolate finish, thick and fudgy please. Heat tickles sides of cheeks with essence of chili without the pain. Ashen burnt black wood in the breath. Vanilla root flirts with massive hunks of decadent fudge. Interesting conflict of creamy velvety smooth mouthfeel which at the same time sucks all moisture from said mouth. Cinnamon not as prominent as expected, though a whisper peeks through here and there, mostly lost in the chilies and the burnt fudgy vanilla rooty goodness.

Final Thoughts: another notch under the Cigar City belt, and mine. Was shared with friends and enjoyed by friends and myself alike. Definitely drink with as minimal a chill as possible.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

3445,"2010-12-03",3.9,"From a trade with Daknole and taken to an East Side Bottle Liberation Society tasting.  My first beer from Cigar City and it was opened with great anticipation.  It was also opened immediately after a Goose Island Bourbon County Stout Vanilla.  A black pour with no red visible.  What a cool head!  Almost blood red!  The aroma is some spicy peppers and cocoa.  The flavor is exactly the same.  To me the peppers did not work here and I would love to try a Zhukov without the peppers.  This was a distant second place to the Goose Island and perhaps the sweetness from that beer did not help this one.  Still it was very tasty and certainly a visual experience.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
3445,"2010-12-03",4.1,"750ml bottle from Daknole.  Pours EXTREMELY black, like the blackest Ive ever seen with a very dark brown head.  Aroma is rich chocolate covered cherries, reminds me of Dark Lord a little in that way.  Graham cracker and olive juice.  The peppers must be adding the olive component.  Flavor is extremely chocolatey.  Thick mouthfeel with roasty, dark dark chocolate flavor.  I burped and it was just chocolate roastiness.  The roastiness is akin to Expedition.  The chocolate and roast might actually be too much for one beer making this beer a little less smooth.  Im kind of over Imperial Stouts at this point but this is a fine and unique example.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
3445,"2010-12-02",4.6,"Thanks to cmillward.  Bottle.  Absolutely delicious stuff.  One of the best stouts that Ive tried so far.  Beautifully dark and thick in the glass.  Head was a shade of brown as dark as any Ive seen.  Mouthfeel was thick with mild carbonation.  Aroma is rich with chocolate, mild roast, big vanilla and some interesting spice.  Dark chocolate, cocoa, vanilla all come through big in the taste, as well.  Im not a big fan of chili in beer, but its very nice in this one, only hitting in the finish with a bit of spice.  This sort of super rich chocolatey imperial stout is right up my alley for the style.  Hops are present but more of a background player.  Pretty sweet but it works well for the beer.  Just a big, rich beer that drinks even bigger than 11% abv.  Very impressive.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3445,"2010-11-30",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2012 Had this on tap at Cigar City early in the afternoon right after I got my ticket to buy the bottles.

A: Pours a very viscous dark, dark brown with a very nice tan head with plenty of lacing.

S: Whoa, lots going on here. Everything is almost overpowering, yet fits so well together. Lots of chocolate up front, followed by more subtle hints of roasted malt, vanilla, roasted chilis, and cinnamon. 

T: Even better than the nose. Right up there with the absolute best imperial stouts Id had; definitely top three. All thats there in the nose is there with the first sip, and the complexity of this beer only improves with each sip as it gets a bit warmer. The chocolate is definitely the base, and the light touches of cinnamon, vanilla, and chili peppers are fantastic and make this such a well-rounded beer. 

M: Very thick and huge. Nice and chewy, yet incredibly smooth. Fairly low carbonation, but entirely appropriate. No alcohol heat.

D: Insane. Each sip brings forth new nuances. I spent less than 16 hours in Tampa, waking up a 3:00am on consecutive days for early flights (one of which didnt pan out), and if I hadnt gotten bottles, Id still be supremely happy and thought the whole trip worth it.

3445,"2010-11-26",2.7,"In short: A full body chocolaty stout with (imho) exaggerated spiciness
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed when about 6 months of age.  Winter 2009/2010 batch.  Bottle sent to me by CaptainCougar, thanks a lot Tom.  Split three-way
The look: Black body topped by a medium tan head with good retention
In long: The strong nose is disturbingly spicy (cinnamon, hot Mexican spices) over a nice layer of cacao.  Taste is more of the same.  Nice full cake-like body.  Lots of bakery black chocolate cake, cacao and friends.  But also lots of spices.  The cinnamon was annoying but its those hot Mexican-food type of spices that really ruined the beer for me.  It sometimes felt like cayenne pepper.  I know many people like the so-called Mayan Chocolate but I dont.  I dont like those spices in my chocolate and I dont like it either in my chocolaty beer.  Also something about the whole mix added a sharp acidic bite at the end which also bothered me.  This rating is a personal subjective opinion.  I honestly think this is a well-brewed beer, but this is one that really doesnt work for me.  We split my bottle three way and two of us didnt finish our glass.  Granted the second one was my brother and we have the very same palate so we only count as one.   Its pretty obvious looking at the rating average that most people enjoy the mix of flavors presented by this beer.  But Im different.

The flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Full body, creamy/chewy/thick texture, soft carbonation, very long finish with moderate bitterness, moderately alcoholic, moderately burning. Like a chocolate cake with chili, you can almost chew it. Perhaps even slightly better than the 2010, chili is rather noticeable, less is cinnamon, with vanilla in the middle. So far, along with Expedition, my favorite stout, and maybe American beer. Same rating of the 2010.","Firenze, ITALY","Slayer85"
3445,"2010-09-19",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 8, 2012 My Bottom Line:
Portentous cinnamon, cocoa and vanilla whirl about this super sweet Imperial Stout, offering a kaleidoscope of flavors grounded by roasted malts and their bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A film of brown foam surfs the impenetrable blackness.
-The nose is very fruity and spicy; not quite what I like in my Imperial Stouts, but still very memorable.
-Although cinnamon is well integrated to the rest of the beer, it doesnt really work with the brews tart edges, imho.
-The voluptuous, almost oily body is able the carry all the flavors but it feels overdone at times (way too heavy).
-The potent sweetness is nearly levelled by the roasted malt and hop resins in the finish.
-Smoked peppers contribute some heat, but mostly smokiness and vegetal notes.

Pours insanely black, void of any light. Thick tar-like syrup. liquid/melted chocolate. I have never seena beer so thick. Dark Brown milk chocolate colored foam. i think a spoon would stand up in this. plenty of thick head a couple fingers deep. It stands still long enough for me to grab my camera and line it up for a few close-ups. I know this one is gonna be good.

Aroma is heavy laiden with roasted malt and burnt toast. some espresso and pepper spice. Loads of dark havy chocolate on the end of the first nose. Espresso and alcohol after a swirl and another smell. I just cant help but stare at this liquid tar, are there preserved dinasaurs stuck in there?

Taking my first sip. insanely thick and heavy. First is the bitter roast bounding my taste buds with hints of coffee slipping through the heavy doses of dark chocolat. rolling around through the tongue out comes spice and smoke. so much chewy thick syrup coats my entire mouth. Chocolate rides all the way across the top with alcohol and vanilla that swarm in the creamy foam that happens as it rolls through my mouth. More sips bring some tobacco and leather to accompany the slight smoke, as it warms a bit more sweetness of chocolate and caramel come out along with more peppery notes, i cant tell if its cinamon or peppers or both. The 8 or 9 ounces that I poured myself of this were definately all I needed.

when i rolled this around in the glass the foam just clung to the glass fighting for its life and reflecting light with glittering accents like little diamonds on the very outreaches of the head.

This is truly one very unique brew. Cant say ive had an imperial stout this big, thick, and heavy. truly a great one. Thanks again Suticase Jon for hooking me up with this one.

This beer could swallow any food up that you throw at it. only the richest most crazy thick triple chocolate cake with chocolate fudge layers and tons of heavy chocolate and roasted coffee sauce drizzled all over it would ever come close to matching up or cutting through this beer. If i was going to die tomorrow, I would order this beer with that cake.

3445,"2010-08-10",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 15, 2010 (Bottle, thanks fata2683) Pours super duper black, maybe the blackest beer I ever seen. Dark brown head (almost black!). The aroma holds boatloads of dark roasted malt with notes of cocoa, soy, salt liquorice, asphalt, light espresso and wet tobacco. The spices are quite subtle, but vanilla and chilli are more notable then the cinnamon. Undertones of black berries, light milk/cheese, light citrus, resin and maybe a touch of dark fruits. Hints of green apples, otherwise a pleasant nose. The flavour is near medium sweet, medium bitter and light acidic. Tones of cocoa, espresso, chilli pepper, vanilla and some hops alongside a sting of dark berries. The mouthfeel is oily and round with a light carbonation. Burned, almost tar-like and tart finish from the dark malts. Dry, dusty roast and burned tartness lingers. Near full-bodied.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","Marsiblursi"

3445,"2010-08-08",4.5,"Bottle, thanks to mikesgroove!(!!) Very,very black pour, so thick and syrupy it looks like it pours slowly. A thick dark brown head sits on top. I really pick up the cocoa on the aroma with the chilis mostly. I was actually expecting something more volatile as an aroma but this is good. Taste is quite complex, lots of vanilla, cocoa and cinnamon. Palate has a good carbonation, which makes the mouthfeel a bit short but not syrupy, quite drinkable. Creamy but not sticky. A very well done imperial stout considering it doesnt benefit from barrel aging.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

theres definitely chilis in the nose.... along with black pepper, raisins, cinnamon, vanilla, dark chocolate, roast, a little rubbery smoke and a touch of sourness.

the flavor is all of that but much more intense... ash, chocolate, cinnamon and peppery spice are amped while it finishes a bit tart. the aftertaste is a nice blend of dark cocoa and vanilla tobacco followed by mellow sweet smoke.

3445,"2010-07-10",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2013 A: Deep black with only the slightest hints of light poking through the edges. Not too impressive of a head... tiny khaki cap, with modest retention. Dissolves to a tight ring around the edges. An occasional wisp of lacing left on the glass.

S: Roasted malt, bitter chocolate and a bit of vanilla. Nothing unusual and certainly not a fair indication of the flavor just around the bend.

T: Bam... this was one of the most unexpected flavor profiles based on the nose... large blasts of bitter dark chocolate, cacao, roasted malts, and vanilla... supplemented with an earthy smoked-woodyness... a little bit of cola... and of course the spicy chilies!

M: Heavy... dense... with some lively carbonation to balance out... nice prolonged finish

The flavor used more well-roasted (and slightly burnt) coffee as a driving force, pushing cocoa and vanilla to the sweeter and mighty tasty edges.. burnt and a little ashy off the back-end, picking up a tasty complement of smoked, dried peppers.. again there was a touch of sour malt at the end.

3445,"2010-06-25",3.8,"From a growler.  Woodshop 5.0 Dinner.  Mostly black, opaque pour with a finger of creamy tan head.  Lots of chocolate nougat in the nose, accented by some light vanilla and roast.  Theres a peculiar cherry gumdrop fruitiness that reminds me distinctly of sloe gin.  The cinnimon spice is clearly noticeable, but the other elements seem to layer themselves more inconspicuously in the beer.  Restrained alcohol warmth.  The resemblance to sloe gin is uncanny - must be some combination of fruitiness from the peppers combined with the alcohol.  Full bodied, medium-light carbonation with a soft, smooth texture.  The flavors are definitely more on the chocolate side of the malt spectrum as opposed to roast or char.  More of the fruity sloe gin notes come through in the flavor, followed up by some of the brighter cinnimon spice.  Minimal hop presence, but well balanced in terms of sweetness.  Unique and enjoyable beer, but I find it draws too much of the complexity from the spice additions, leaving the malt to be kind of just there, supporting the spice.  I wouldnt say its over-spiced, but I definitely preferred the Marshal Zhukov base beer, so its not adding anything for me either.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

3445,"2010-05-31",4.5,"I am amazed I had the pleasure of trying this beer. Thanks Kyle! Pours black and black can be. The head is very dark brown. The aroma has chocolate, smoke, and a hint of pepper. The flavor is amazingly complex, and equally amazingly balanced. Chocolate, smoke, vanilla, marshmallow, cherries, black berries, cinnamon, molasses, and peppers. The capsicum tingles the tongue at first, and then builds as you sip but never becomes overwhelming. Absolutely fantastic beer.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","hobbersr"
3445,"2010-05-30",4.7,"750ml bottle courtesy of CaptainCougar.  Thanks!  Right off the bat this beer gets a five for appearance.  It pours a viscous oily black and creates thick beige, almost purple head that laces the glass throughout.  Rich and full-bodied.  Lots of chocolate tones, bold stuff.  I suppose you do get a little pepper heat in the aftertaste, but you could also attribute that to the high ABV.  Thick milkshake mouthfeel.  Certainly in the top tier of Imperial Stouts.  Maintains a cocoa-smoothness despite the big, rich, malty undercurrents.  Great beer.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
3445,"2010-05-28",4.8,"Bottle. Massive props to fata2683 for scoring me this one! Rating 500! Where to begin... Pours black, deep, dark, brown, thick, persistent head. Lacing is pretty staggering. Aromas of spice (capsicum), vanilla, chocolate, roast, smells of bourbon, despite not being barrel-aged. Flavors are spicy and sweet, wonderfully balanced, spice builds slowly, and leaves your mouth tingling 90 seconds after you swallow. A potent and awesome brew. I loved it, my beergeek friends loved it, my beer-hating girlfriend even enjoyed it! Breathtaking!","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","Savvy1982"
3445,"2010-05-26",4.3,"A - Pours a viscous black ink that a dark chocolate head rises from, sheet stays, some webs.

S - Roasted malts, coffee, tobacco, chocolate, smokey ancho, slight vanilla and alcohol warmth.

T - This is a pretty complex beer that definitely needs to reach the correct drinking temp. Starts with chocolate sweetness, mid palate slight cinnamon, which fades into the eventual super roasted finish that reminds me of a good cup of black coffee.

M/D - The mouthfeel is perfect, think and oily with the right amount of carbonation to help it over your tongue. Drinkability only suffers for me due to the amount of roasted malts. This beer would be great with a chocolate ancho cake, but might be overkill.","Austin, Texas, USA","xpimptastikx"
3445,"2010-05-26",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2011 Thanks Kevin for sharing this!

A- Body is thick and solid motor oil black. Pours with a 1 finger foamy dark brown head that has good retention and some lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- Awesome, exceptional, and unexpected for an imperial stout. The highlight is a huge spiciness-hot pepper and a hint of cinnamon. This is really in balance with rich bittersweet dark chocolate, anise and licorice.

T- Upfront is an accent of spiciness over prominent roasted malt and rich dark chocolate. Some anise is in the background. The finish is quite smooth and adds a hint of vanilla sweetness. A slight alcohol heat lingers.

P- Medium carbonation with a smooth, syrupy, and exceptionally smooth and creamy body.

O- I am very impressed with this brew. Has to be one of my top stouts. I love the addition of cinnamon and hot pepper and think it compliments the stout qualities very well. Would love to have this one again!

3445,"2010-05-25",4.1,"A: Quite an ominous pour from the bottle. Viscous and black, creating a sturdy mocha head in the glass.

S: I was worried that the chili peppers would overwhelm the beer, but they provide only a subtle spice to the beer which works nicely with the sweet components. Chocolate and vanilla, along with caramel and roasted malts complete the nose.

T: A much more balanced flavor than the BA version offers. An inviting sweetness up-front of chocolate and vanilla, followed by a touch of bitterness and spice (chili and cinnamon) on the back end.

M: A very thick and chewy feel on the tongue. The carbonation is minimal, as it should be and just helps to enhance the creaminess.

D: The alcohol is nowhere to be found, but this one does pack quite the punch. A fantastic stout and one of the first CCB beers Ive been really impressed by.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

I wasnt worried about rating it since I had a bottle in the back fridge.  It was really good that day.  Now, Im cracking open the 750 to drink all by myself.  It pours a solid black color with a small brown head.  After a good swirl, light spotty lacing is left behind along with a fine tan film left after the swirl.  Aroma is roasted malt, light chocolate and coffee, dark esters, and a touch of vegetables.  Flavor is sweet chocolate, roasted malt, esters, and light spice.  Cant detect the vanilla.  Finish is roasted chocolate that leaves the lips smackin.  Medium to full body.  A pretty damn nice beer.  Thanks Dak and Jason.","BFE, Arizona, USA","cbkschubert"
3445,"2010-05-23",3.5,"Bottle thanks to Maltzilla!Black, head darker than cardboard. Green nose of pepper, too harsh for the sweet chocolate and light vanilla background and the contradiction is at once vegetal and ashy. Taste is a bit better, more balance than the nose with the pepper taking a backseat. Still, its rather straightforward sweetness in chocolate and vanilla, not much nuance or integration. A collection of flavors in balance, some working some not, and overall not very well integrated.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

S-the nose brings something different every time I swirl it. the chilies and pepper notes will show through on one. the cocoa nibs on another, a good bit of roasted malts throughout with a touch of vanilla. anise and molasses in the back with a touch of dark fruits. hints of fusel alcohol in the back but still solid.

T-the pepper spice is right up front, roasted malts, dark chocolate and vanilla behind. the cinnamon comes in towards the back with a fair bit of dark fruity sweetness to close the deal. lots going on here and it works fairly well together.

M-this is very smooth on the palate, full bodied and slightly dry in the back. so soft in my mouth. just enough carb to allow this to fall softly down the throat.

D-this has some interesting stuff going on, the sweetness is very nice in the back to balance the peppery spice up front. it is a well done contrast with a nice balance to it.  not something I can drink a ton of but still a tasty brew!","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"

Quite a beast on the tongue, packed with big smokey, roasted flavours and loads of bittersweet chocolate, sprinkled with vanilla. So bloody smooth on the tongue, really something else indeed!

Roasty aroma with a lot of chocolate and vanilla sweetness. Some very light spice and molasses as well. Flavor starts with a heavy and chewy roasted note followed up by a very nice and semi-sweet cocoa and vanilla flavor. The alcohol warms it up and really helps to enhance the sweetness of the cocoa and the chocolate. A little coffee comes through near the end.

I mostly just sense the alcohol in the nose and get a bit of hops, and a little bit of the peppers. The taste is a mixed bag; sweet with a bit of alcohol warming the back-end; a little pepper bite on the tip of my tongue and thats it for the spice; bit of chocolate and a hint of vanilla. Every now and then there is a slight burn in the back of my throat to remind me that there is peppers in this, but ever so slight. Very viscous and coats the tongue and mouth very nicely.

Really dense jet black oily pour and like an oil slick in a glass.  Denser tan head that just leaves a patchy tan film on top.  A lot of dark, nearly bitter chocolate in the aroma at first, then the peppers come in a little with more roasted coffee aromas than anything.  I really love how this brew is barely sweet at all to my palate.  Lots of dry, roasted qualities.  Love the spice on top of the dense coffee and chocolate and very much enjoyed the bit of burn at the back of my throat from the pepper and alcohol combo.

Some vanilla aged wood also. Damn this is crazy already. Coating mouthfeel. Thick black coffee flavor with roasted nuts and malts. The peppers in this provide for a gentle mix of new and unique flavors. They also give the slightest kick which continues into the finish.

Cocoa is the star here with a pleasant supporting cast of vanilla, ancho and cinnamon in that order. The alcohol is hidden well yet warms in the finish.

Surprisingly subtle nose with burnt caramel and firm pickly peppers. Spritzy body with slightly tart chocolate, coffee, and bitter roasted malt meshed with pickly, almost sour chiles. Vanilla is prominent mainly in the finish.

Its like the death metal of imperial stouts, Zhukov staring down the Mayan apocalypse. The aroma is rich and heady just like the base, but I was getting strong notes of coffee flan along with the sharp spices that are oh so inviting. Super creamy mouthfeel, a bit slick and grainy in a way that seems fitting. The taste is just so complex. Theres such depth and character in Zhukov anyways, but I love the way the taste of charred wood and tons of pepper take this to a delicious next level.

A lot of chocolaty goodness. Full-bodied, with low carbonation and an oily mouthfeel. Re-Rate: 7/27/12. Yeah, this needed a re-rate, and what better occasion than a full vertical and horizontal? We had a 2012 back to a 2010, and even a 2009 that was bottled from a tap at a bar whose name shall remain secret. That one was infected, so Ill leave it out. The 2010 through 2012 are all doing great. 2010 was the roastiest of the bunch, and the one where the pepper was the most mellowed out. All have notes of roast, dark chocolate, fudge, and pepper, without as much vanilla as Id remembered. 2011 had by far the most chocolate in it, getting roastier and more peppery as it moved along. 2012 had the most pepper, and was very smooth throughout.

3445,"2010-04-26",4.5,"Bottle courtesy of dmac, thanks Dave! Shared with fordest, toncatcher, some other guy, and the rest of the East County crew. Poured a deep dark abyss black, with a reddish hue at the liquid level. Swirled around the glass created some brownish foam. Oily residue on the glass left behind. Aroma was chocolate, coffee, with hints of licorice, vanilla. First flavor to hit my tongue was coffee, finishing with chocolate, vanilla. I was unable to detect the chillis. I think more spice would have been good. A true masterpiece. We all enjoyed this one.","(San Diego) Santee, California, USA","padrefan98"
3445,"2010-04-26",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2010 Bottle, sampled at DLD thanks to Hoosier Beer Geek. Pours black, iodine film coats the glass. This beer is as dark and rich as Dark Lord. Taste is very complex. Cocoa, fruity chile notes and the cinnamon and vanilla are just there with a hint to balance. The nose is a perfect match to the taste with a solid Mexican chocolate note, well balanced by alcohol. Its hard to put in words, but this is fantastic.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
3445,"2010-04-25",4.3,"750ml bottle thanks to smith4498. Pours black with big thick dark tan head. Aromas of roasted malts, cocoa, and chocolate. Flavor is robust with thick dark malts, tons of chocolate, light cinnamon, light smoke, and very faint heat from chilis. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Not abrasive in any way. Flavors come together so well. It got even better as I let the bottle warm for a couple hours while on the way home from DLD. This beer comes with tons of hype and it lived up to it. Just like the rest of the CCB brews I have had.","Mount Prospect, Illinois, USA","msante79"
3445,"2010-04-25",3.9,"Sampled at DLD 2010.  Very dense black with a deep brown head.  Big chocolate nose with some spicy hops.  Beefy flavor with some chocolate and leathery character.  Very palate coating.  Tasty.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
3445,"2010-04-24",3.4,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2014 I got to sampled this at DLD2010 thanks to the generosity of the Florida crew.  Very black pour with light brown head.  Aroma of dark chocolate, roast, some spice.  Flavor is thick and complex as hell.  Mostly rich, thick dark chocolate with a bit of heat from the peppers to keep it from getting too sweet.  Thick mouthfeel.  Absolutely awesome.

Re-rate: Think bodied, very mild chile heat, chocolate, nondescript sweetness. The mighty have fallen.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"

Once again thanks to either Mike or Eric for coming through with the beer of the night. None of them were bad but after having this the subsequent imperial stouts were framed in a different light. I was skeptical of the praise being heaped on Cigar City before but if this is any indication I cant wait to make a trip to Tampa some day.

Aroma / Appearance - Sticky sheets of dirty lacing formed an oily layer. Beneath was a deep brown head darker than some beers. At the bottom of the three layer cake was an oily black body. Inside was a rich blend of cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla beans, black coffee, and raspberries. Extremely sweet for an imperial stout this was certainly novel.

Flavor / Palate - Green pepper, cinnamon sticks, cigar ash, vanilla beans, and coffee cake fill the mouth with a rich dense liquid. The chewiness extends to the finish. Heavy on the malt this beer is one of the best I have tried and on par with Dark Lord, Speedway Stout, and other world class big beers. Assuming you dont have to trade away a first born child to get a bottle give it a try.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
3445,"2010-04-24",4.1,"22 oz bomber from Bierkraft.  Very, very thick, sticky pitch black pour topped by a deep, dark brown creamy mousse.  The nose is absolutely loaded with rich cocoa and chocolate.  Thick and unctuous palate that is sticky, slick and palate coating.  There is just a kiss of chile flavour with lots of chile heat and a fairly pronounced cinnamon character on the back of all the big roastiness.  Warming brings more cinnamon and cocoa to the front and also lends a molasses character to the beer as well.  The ancho really comes up as well and the warm woodiness of the cinnamon starts to stick around and the beer comes together much better than it does when its cooler.  Rich and sticky and a very unique beer.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3445,"2010-04-23",4.5,"My first ever rating.  Might as well start off in style. Amazing beer. Aroma is a combo of sour fruit and charred rubble with a tinge of pepper spiciness. Mouthfeel is thick...super thick. Gets softer as it warms. Melds with the mouth as it approaches room temp. Flavor (to me) is Zhukov with big dark, partially sour fruit, teenie tiny tinges of vanilla and cinnamon, smokey charred goodness, all drenched in a blanket of bittersweet chocolate.  This may be my first rating, but it is far from my first beer...and Ive never had anything like this. World class, but very left of center. If you live for beer, make sure you try this one before you expire.","Pennsylvania, USA","vingio311"
3445,"2010-04-23",4.2,"(750ml bottle thanks to ericandersnavy) jet black pour that coats the glass with deep brown hues, no bubbles. Nose of olives, spicy chiles, fudge and dark chocolate.

3445,"2010-04-20",3.1,"The aroma is very much suited to the style with burnt malt, chocolate, and coffee. The color is almost black with a thin brown head. The taste is like the aroma with a toasty finish. The palate is thick. Overall this beer has all the elements to fit the style and would stand up well to a cigar however it is lacking some of the flavors that I wanted and stronger on some I didnt.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"

Nose is chocolate, cinnamon, pepper, roast.  Flavor is big and sweet with the spiciness of the peppers working well with the chocolate and molasses.  Its big and sweet without being too cloying like many many other recent RIS. Pretty tasty and one of the better CCB beers Ive tasted.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
3445,"2010-04-19",3.1,"Bottle at miketds.  Thanks Mike!  Poured a dense black with a thick dark tan/brownish head.  Rich aromas or burnt malts, vanilla, chocolate and some earthiness.  Taste is unfortunelty one dimensional.  Straight forward chocolate/coffee and it is sickenly sweet.  There is some vanilla present, but it is overwhelmed by the other flavors.  I got no chili out of the beer.  I had approximately 4 oz. and that was tough to finish just because it was so sweet.  Glad I got to try it.","The Land of Milk and Honey, Ohio, USA","Cliff"

The beer pours a inky black color with a brown, small head. The beer is oily and coats the sides of the glass. The aroma is roasted and burnt malt with dark fruit. The flavor is cinnamon, dark fruit, roasted/burnt malt, semi-sweet chocolate and pepper. The mouthfeel and thick and chewy and the carbonation is pretty low.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
3445,"2010-04-17",3.9,"Bottle from Jimbo.   Smells fantastic:  Coffee, chocolate, vanilla, spices.   Darkest pour I think I have ever seen.  As someone said, ""It looks like pudding.""  Flavor was heavy on chocolate and coffee.  I was kind of hoping that the pepper flavor would shine through a bit more.  This was a bit on the dry side for me, but overall I thought it was very good.","Poway, California, USA","Naven"

The peppers come out more in the taste, as does the chocolate and vanilla... its all very well balanced, even a bit fruity.

3445,"2010-04-14",4.1,"Poured Black like the stallion of midnight and stuff. I noticed a light tan fizz on top that disappeared fast, like Grease Lightning. Smelled different not like the uncle you rarely see, but more like a Mexican pinata before it is filled, not really but it sounds fun. I guess the smells are from the chiles? The taste is blended nicely with hints of nutmeg or cinnamon, chocolate (unsweet), the blend of chiles and finishes quite dry.","Panama City Beach, Florida, USA","jbone78"
3445,"2010-04-12",4.4,"Thanks to drowland for this one, my 2000th rating. This immediately pours one of the most visually impressive brews Ive ever seen, the color of tar and viscosity of oil with a turbid head the color of charred wood.  Nose is earthy and peppery, bakers chocolate, mild roast, molasses and a mild sweetness, coffee. Not nearly as forward or impressive as the flavor. Nice  pepper and bakers chocolate pairing in the flavor, coffee and roast, molasses, sweet, some grain bitterness, mild alcohol. Palate is very viscous and thick with a smooth capsaicin heat and alcohol coming through.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
3445,"2010-04-12",3.7,"750mL courtesy of Travlr. Pours ink well black with a head so dark brown it looks Martian red. Jesus. Very nice lace. Aroma is grapes, smoked meats, barbecue ribs, bacon. Interesting mix. Taste is fresh grapes, raisins and moves to a chalky, powdery finish. I think the base beer here, Zhukov, is one of my least favorite Imperial stouts. The Hunahpu treatment is a shoe in for an amazing beer, but the base beer is just so bad that you cant hide from it. Maybe do the Hunahpu treatment to the 110K.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

I loved BA Hunahpu. This not as much. Whatever. One persons opinion, right?. Pours with a deep brown head and a black body.  Glass coating. Aroma is ashy, tobacco, earthy, chocolate nibs, cinnamon.

3445,"2010-04-07",3.5,"750 ml bottle shared by mreusch. Pour is a deep syrupy black with a 1/2 inch dark khaki head. Head falls fast was splotchy lacing. Aroma of roasted malt, soy, and some alcohol heat. Taste is the roast, sweet malt and then a bit of the soy from the nose. Some dark dried fruit in the back - Eugene said prune, and that sounds about right.  Also a slight hint of grainy cinnamon.  The alcohol is better integrated in taste than nose, though still present. Sweetness cloys a bit in the finish. Palate is medium to heavy bodied, low carbonation and a hot finish. Thanks for sharing this one Matt.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
3445,"2010-04-07",3.5,"Bottle shared by MrPickles...thanks Andy! - Pours jet black with a deep brown head. Smells dark and roasty, with sharp alcohol notes. Pretty one-note and disappointing, given the gushing from previous rates over the smell. Taste is much better, with a bit of molasses sweetness up front, transitioning into some smoky roast, burnt charcoal, and a touch of peppery heat on the finish. Smooth and really big, but the sweet/burnt combo is a bit bruising. The heat is unique, but not enough to make this any more than average.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
3445,"2010-04-07",3.5,"750ml bottle, with thanks to both gunhaver and Ibrew2or3 for bottles.  Pours a thick looking oily dark black with a moderate dark brown head.  Aroma is mostly heavily roasted/burnt malts, with some cinnamon, vanilla, light pepper and chocolate behind that.  Flavor is similar with the heavy roast throughout, and more background cinnamon, a little vanilla, some cocoa, and maybe the slightest pepper heat if I really look for it, but overall the burnt/roast malts mostly push any nuance out of the way.  Decent enough, but was hoping for more complexity and dimensions with the treatments.  Thanks for the chance to try guys!","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"

3445,"2010-04-04",4.4,"Bottle shared by Kan, thanks man!  Pour is almost unbelievably thick, dark, and rich.  I have never seen anything like it.  Also a very nice, full dark brown head that lingered for quite a while.  Best looking pour I have seen to date.  Aroma is more subtle than pour but still big.  Lots of molasses, roasted malt, and brown sugar.  Also notes of vanilla, light spice, and a background fruitiness that I think comes from the chilies.  The chili aroma is not too evident beyond that.  The flavor is also huge roasted malt balanced by molasses tones, vanilla, and a light chocolaty component that rounds out the flavor.  Again, not really much action from the chilies but an amazing beer nonetheless.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"

Flavour is thick milk and dark chocolate.  bitterness creeps in and becomes strong without you noticing until it has fully developed.  Theres a peppery spiciness that tingles the tongue and lips.

Body is as rich and coating as old motor oil with a lingering sticky feel and late throat tingle from the peppers. Intense and lovely. Flavor is intensely roasty, chocolately, and with perfect interplay of spicy, peppery heat, pepper flesh, and roast, spicy Mounds bar.

Alright this is why we came to Tampa. While I have had this beer before at craft festivals I have never actually reviewed it. Love the nose of this beer, it has such strong scent of coffee and cinnamon. It is hard to compare that odor, but it makes me happy. After first sip you can taste the cinnamon, coffee, and a hint of brown sugar and vanilla. Pretty complex and matures well while reaching room temperature. I would say slightly chilled is a great temperature for this 11% ABV beer. It is very smooth and easy to drink. Not an extremely thick Imperial stout. WowIm really happy that I came to Tampa and am able to pick up some bottles of this beer. I personally think it is going to become AMAZING after a few years in the cellar.

3445,"2010-03-13",4.3,"Huge thanks to mashmaster for sending a hand bottle of this one. Shared with a few deserving friends. Pours deep black with a burnt mocha head - beautiful, and the carbonation held up really well in the hand-bottle. Roasty aroma, and a lot of the sweetness shows through - vanilla and chocolate, with a subtle hint of the complexity underneath. The taste is really a myriad of different flavors moving through stages in your mouth. Traditional notes of chocolate and coffee are quickly compounded with peppers. Roasted, even smoked peppers. More chocolate shows up with waves of vanilla, and then the spice builds. It sizzles in your mouth, then fades into a wonderfully smooth chocolate, melting away and leaving a mild tingling sensation behind. For any Seattleites, this is like a Theo chili chocolate bar. So complex - there are so many layers in here. It may be a little hot - but Im a big fan.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

I now drink and like bourbon for one thing. Perfectly balanced rich molasses, cocoa bitter, light touch of the hot pepper, cinnamon. Great stuff.  MARCH 2014: Vertical kindly shared by Lance up at Proof (dude, thanks). Very interesting to try these side by side: ( 11 - musty, 1st); (12 - 4th, easily worst); (13 - soy - 3rd); (14 - 2nd close to 11);  ORIGINAL RATE, 3/11/2010: My first run at this - going to the bottle release tomorrow - this one on tap at the dubliner.  Ive had the Zhukovs and this is a fair bit different.  Ill give a more proper rate soon, but this is my initial impression score.  ReRate:  had this a few times now and this is my last bottle from the release party at the brewery.  Giant aroma of cocoa, coffee, peppers and vanilla.  Rich tastes of dark chocolate, burnt coffee, wood, vanilla, tobacco and the peppers.  This is a complex brew for sure.  Finishes up slightly sour - but still dominated by the ashy bitter and pepper tastes.  Its an interesting experience for sure.  I love the Zhukov because its so drinkable and complex.

A - Pours black, tan head (a fingers-worth), good retention, and some lacing along the sides of the glass. A slim cap of head on top.

S - Very pronounced chocolate, some chili spices (not overpowering though), vanilla, dark fruits.

T - Lots of chocolate on the palate. Very very chocolatey rich mixed in with some chili notes. Somehow, for me, the combo works. Ive never had a stout with such a real pronounced chocolate notes. Sweet and spicy finish.

M - Full bodied, rich, smooth, light carbonation. 

D - I drank several pours and it was just as good (if not better) after every pour. Im looking forward to trying this in the bottle to see if it differs at all. The hype on this one is well-deserving. Possibly my favorite Imperial Stout Ive ever had (beats Bells Black Note, IMO).","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"

The peppers are there in force. They are slightly distracting and Id love to see them toned down just a bit (barrel aged version maybe?) however they really make this unique.

3445,"2010-02-21",4.1,"[Bottle] shared by tytoanderso. Counter-pressure filled Bierkraft bomber pours inky black with a moderate super dark brown head that gradually dissipates into a few soapy bubbles. Aroma has a definite pepper presence, dark chocolate, roasty malts, French press coffee and some fresh coffee beans. Flavor is really strange and unique. Chalky and astringent bittersweet roasted malts, lots of spicy pepper, lots of dusty chocolate and cocoa powder, alcohol is slightly noticeable. The pepper is really interesting  lightly green but smoky and earthy overall with a light actual spiciness that really builds as I drink it. I dont get much for cinnamon or vanilla, but it doesnt matter too much. Long super astringent and bittersweet finish. Unique beer and one that Im happy to have had.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","MatSciGuy"

Bittersweet chocolate, vanilla extract, nutmeg. I know this hasnt seen the ""humidor treatment"" but I swear that I smell cedar. Maybe some molasses? Slight ash and char upon warming. It pours about as gorgeous as an imperial stout can get. Thick, oily liquid with a deep, rich, thick, mocha colored frothy, lasting head. Flavor is actually a very pleasant balance of smoky (not spicy) peppers and mild chocolate liqueur. Molasses, wet wood, more cedar (maybe its the cinnamon). The malt, chocolate, vanilla and peppers actually come together rather nicely. Viscous, but not cloying mouth feel with a slightly ashy and smoky finish. Unique and rather tasty!

On draft at the tasting room party.  The appearance was good but not great, I think that Id like to pour this into a snifter before deciding if it deserves a 5.  The nose has strong, strong chocolate that meshes well with some notes of vanilla.  Didnt detect much of the pepper until it got warmer.  The mouthfeel is extremely creamy and just divine, and the taste very closely follows the nose.  Theres a great blend of chocolate and vanilla with no coffee or burnt malt taste.  Dont notice too many hop flavors either.  Not too sweet, just right.  The pepper hits the back of the palate gently but isnt as significant as I expected.  Lived up to my expectations, and I cannot wait to try this again.  Also, its preposterously easy to drink two or three glasses of this.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"

The flavor was heavy, syrupy with the dark malt, complemented by vanilla, a hoppy bitterness, cocoa, anise, and damp wood.  The ancho came around near the end along wth a soft sour twist.

Initial is big and bitter, hops and roasted malts, vanilla and dark chocolate is very dominant, in the raw, very bitter, the malts and hops take over, the light heat grows on the back of the palate, not being a shocker, moreso a light dusting, growing and complimenting the roast well. Bitter, thick and covering the palate well. The heat grows in the belly, but lightly, nothing to overtake the flavors of roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate with pretty prominent bitterness. Licorice and subtle chalkiness, the beer really works well for dessert. Very nice. Rerate pending - 2011 Bottles show lively spice and pepper, very nice.

Pours a deep brown with a small tan head.  Aroma has notes of coffee, molasses, vanilla, dough,  and smoked meat.  Off to a good start!  Flavor comes through with a nice flowing  tabacco, hot pepper (seemed more like jalapenos than chili peppers,) roast, and cocoa.  The hot pepper gives a nice complimentary bite to this.  Doesnt overpower or take away from the other attributes of the beer- like rogue chipolte ale, for instance. Nice body, sticky mouthfeel.  Pretty solid all around and tasty fo sho.  A great, complex stout where the heat and smoke work great together making this a very different beer from regular zhukov.  I enjoyed both regular zhukov and this quite a bit, but, if both were readily available,  I could see myself drinking the original zhukov on a more regular basis.  Likely goes great with a cigar.

   Anywho, on to the beer:  Smells great.  What is this about the beer that smells great.  Some weird adjunct.  Im not sure.  Tons of chocolate.  Kind of reminds me of a malted milk ball.  The taste has some throat burn that lingers.  Originally, I thought it was alcohol burn, but now I think its more likely from the peppers.  Very, very good.  Very easy to drink.

3445,"2009-12-13",4.0,"Pours a dark brown with a wispy yet thin brown head.  Nose is subtle with cocoa, raisin, and subtly smokey from the chilis.  The cocoa and the chilis combine in a very mole sort of way...but the super aggressive hopping keeps them from really coming together as the bitterness distracts a bit.  The cocoa flavors are pretty vivid though... the capsicum heat is a bit of a creeper as it at first is just a subtle scratchiness but after a while you can feel the heat throughout your mouth and throat.  The vanilla notes are nicely complimenting....and Im really digging the influence of the chilis, the chocolate, and the vanilla...almost a kin to a nice mole.  Other than the out of place bitterness here, this is a pretty nice beer.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"

Aroma is intensely chocolate.  Vanilla and alcohol also make their presence known, leading to an extract essence.
Taste has a ton of ancho making it very astringent- distractingly so.  Cocoa, bitter roasted malt, and hoppy pine round out the flavors.  
Finish is bitter cocoa, ancho chalkiness, and slightly cloying.

Pours pitch black and completely opaque with a frothy dark mocha/ chocolate brown head with good retention that slowly settles into a lasting ring which leaves sporadic spots of lacing behind.

Bitter sweet dark chocolate aroma with some slight earthiness, caramel and chocolate malt, licorice, subtle dark fruit, vanilla and a strong chili pepper presence. This adds a bit of spicy cinnamon/peppery character to the nose.

Chewy viscous medium body with lots of silky chocolate malt, toffee, coffee, vanilla, and slight hazelnut notes. There is an amazing spicy peppery chili presence in the finish which adds extra complexity to this unique beer. The chilies add a nice bit of heat but it is pleasant and not gimmicky at all like that Cave Creek beer or that peppercorn beer from Dieu du Ciel. Its more like an artisan chocolate bar in beer form. The chili heat flavor could have easily ruined the beer but it provides an excellent balance to the sweetness and roasted malt notes
and lingers long after the finish making me crave another sip. The high ABV is excellently masked and the only heat is from the peppers making it pretty drinkable considering its strength. Highly recommended.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

The aroma is very sweet overall for an impy thanks to the vanilla, cinnamon and cocoa nibs. The dark roasted malts combine with the other ingredients to form an anise aroma. Also detected was cocoa, espresso, vanilla, chocolate and pepper. The flavor is great with lots of pepper coming in on the aftertaste and sweetness in the begining with some espresso and roastiness in the middle. Full bodied with soft carbonation and an oily slick feel overall.

3445,"2009-11-30",4.9,"22oz counterpressure-filled bottle, courtesy of spacecoyote. Thanks, Carl! This beer... man. Pitch-black core; slight oiliness and viscosity; dark, dark cocoa head with excellent retention and persistent fine-bubbled lacing; this is not a light beer; as dark as I remember Expedition being, maybe darker; a perfect pour. Gorgeous, beautifully presented aroma: plenty of cocoa, leather, and cinnamon; minimal hop presence, but this is anything but overtly sweet: hints of tootsie roll?; dense, perfectly balanced chocolate and cocoa presence mixed with a cinnamon character that is just lovely here; touch of vanilla; touch of peppery heat, sure, but not as much as the mouth; whereas some imperial stouts seem cluttered, this is clear in the notes it strikes: cinnamon, cocoa, light roast and char; just a gorgeous presentation; so close to perfect. Full mouthfeel: oily, creamy, viscous presence on the palate without coming off as heavy; its hard for me to put something above Expedition, but this is wonderful: oily, good amounts of nuttiness and chocolate and charred notes, and the peppery notes and cinnamon mix in beautifully; dense and layered flavor without coming off as heavy; intensely drinkable; everything melded so well by the perimeter of heat, the suggestion of a cinnamon latte; Im getting hints of eggnog, cocoa, peppers without any vegetal character; wow. Just, wow. After the few other Cigar City offerings Ive tried, I was expecting to be, maybe?, underwhelmed... Layers upon layers of perfectly presented spice, cocoa, chocolate, cinnamon, and creaminess. Lasting finish: here, the cocoa notes really shine, along with an oily peanut character, light roast, and lasting chocolate. This is the most beautiful beer I have ever tasted.

Starts with semi-sweet chocolate then roast and coffee, followed by some smoke, vanilla, then chili peppers, cinnamon, wood and bitter cocoa and hops on the finish.  The complexity is pretty crazy.  Medium full on the palate with a bitter cocoa chalkiness.  Bitterness really sticks with you, and I feel like its more from the cocoa than the hops.

To think 3-0-0-0 times I scraped together notes, text messages, countless pads, notebooks, memories, MS word docs, scraps of paper, napkins, my hand, and excel documents to share my voice and opinion about this bitter sweet nectar we call beer. I feel a huge sense of accomplishment.  I have gained so many friends, memories, and experiences in the world of beer that I am so grateful for.  I wish I could thank everyone who has helped me to get here, theres too many of you to name, but thats to all of you that made this possible. 
Now for #3K, Im proud to upload a new imperial stout rating.  Thanks to Nelson and the Floridian (GUNHAVER, thanks man) that made this happen. Packaged in what looks like a medicine jar is a black nectar.  Duct tape has been wrapped around the bottle more times than your typical tape spindle.  Packed like a bombshell comes a partially filled ""growler"".  Even with all the room to breathe there seems to be no damper on the quality of this black nectar.  I slip away momentarily from the tasting that Im attending to indulge.  A black viscous liquid with a coffee tan head, quickly diminishing.  A pure onslaught of aromas and flavors, this is intricate as hell.  A spiced beer, a fall pumpkin treat, a chocolate imperial stout, it hardly matters, its fantastic.  A dark chocolate kiss warped in a citrus peppered shell.  Reminiscent of apple cinnamon pancakes and powdered sugar.  Spicy chili pumpkin and chocolate truffles.  Mother of god the aroma is flawless, what a treat.  Full yet hardly flaunting the effervescent spicy, chocolate warming.  Absolutely delicious!  Thanks to Cigar City for an incredible treat. I really hope to have this again on a brisk October evening.  Cheers!","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"

This beer is the standard Marshal Zhukovs Imperial Stout kicked up a bit. Some chili were added along with a bit of vanilla and cocoa nibs.

A: Like all Cigar City stouts this one is evil looking in the glass. As dark as night with a huge creamy brownish black head. The beer clings to the glass as if it is laced with oil. The head hangs around nice, and leaves big chunks of that dark brown goodness.

S: To say the aromas are bold would be an understatement. Huge charred malt aromas with strong notes of bitter chocolate. Light hints of roasted chilis can be detected as well. The vanilla hides beneath all these bold aromas along with a bit of dark fruit and tobacco.

T: The roasted malt is the first thing you detect here. Coffee come next along wtih a blast of bitter chocolate and tobacco. A touch of vanilla can be picked up and then the chilis create a touch of warmth on the back of the tongue. Very complex and very unique.

M: Very full bodied, smooth, creamy with the chilis creating a real depth.

D: Not as drinkable as some of the other Cigar City stouts, but it sure is tasty. A one of a kind treat.

The flavor reminds me of mexican hot chocolate, similar to what some of the other raters have said.  A spicy finish is perfect.  The body on this was full, the carbonation was soft and the mouthfeel was creamy and tingly (from the spice).  I absolutely loved this one.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","nqualls"

The aroma is crazy - milk chocolate, ancho and alcohol.  Big and brash.  On the palate, this is a rich imperial stout, very thick, with a great ancho and chocolate accent.  Fun stuff.  Original rating, draught at the brewery.  Extra black body with a rich dark brown head.  Complex aroma - chocolate, tobacco, light ancho and dark fruit.  Tastes like beer candy - ancho, lots of dark fruit, rich coffee, intense dark sugars, creamy black malts, cherries.  There are so many layers to this its scary.

3445,"2009-02-16",4.4,"First foray from these guys was on cask at ACAT. Best of fest and definite points for originality. Reminds me of mexican hot chocolate, well at least, an alcoholic version of hit. Spicy, chocolaty, interesting goodness. Chocolate flavor upfront with the hot and spicy on the back end. The spice stays with you for a while but you take another sip to get back to the smooth and cooling chocolate flavors.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
3445,"2009-02-15",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2010 Pours thicker than a hot chocolate in Barcelona. A two-fingered head. In the aroma, spices precede the chocolate and lead you in. The cassia is predominant. A creamy mouthfeel is as smooth as can be. Its impossibly smooth. Mole-like flavor complexity with some spice, some acidity, some chocolate in savvy format. The best exhibition of Mayan chocolate. As it warms the pure dark cocoa emerges even more. Then the cedar boosts the body even though its flavors are buried beneath the superb Mayan chocolate experience. Sublime and dreamy.Re-rate from bottle. Inky thick black yields a dark brown head. Smells hot and smoky. Smoke is pronounced and spices are apparent in the back of the nose. Can really taste the ancho as it warms.

Pours black with a thin dark head.  Aroma is cocoa, some peppers, cinnamon, earth, alcohol, malt, chocolate, coffee, and spice.  Flavor does not disappoint, either: cocoa, coffee, cinnamon, cocoa, tobacco, peppery chilies, vanilla, spice, and complexity.  Lots of yellow lace swirls around this teeming dervish of flavor.

3445,"2009-02-02",4.2,"Appearance: Black, turbid body with a thin, bubbly, dark tan head.

Smell: Highly roasty nose with full notes of dark chocolate, black coffee, spices, a big pinch of Captain Black tobacco (white blend, natch), and a sharp, vegetal note from the chilies contained within.

Taste: A heady mixture of roasted maltiness, chocolate, and vanilla give you a sip of Kahlua garnished with a sprinkling of cinnamon. Before long the heat and spice from the peppers kick in, but its very well-integrated and complimentary to the overall flavor. A few careful drops of prune juice. More tobacco, which really is all too appropriate coming from a joint called Cigar city. Earthy hops with a modest amount of bitterness. Packed with flavor to the very end, theres even a bit of persistent heat beyond the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-low carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Very nice. Beers with peppers have come a long, long way since the infamous Cave Creek Chili Beer, havent they? Without a doubt, Im sure Crazy Ed is smiling down from heaven at Hunahpus Imperial Stout.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Taste was very similar, with the spice coming through in the finish.  Fruit was less pronounced in the taste than smell.  First sample was very light on spice; second sample (bottom of cask) was very heavily spiced, must have been some settling.  Mouth was smoth and full.

Pour almost completely black with a bubbly mocha head that doesnt stick around too long.

Well I knew I was in for an interesting beer when I got my first whiff.  It has the typical dark chocolate malts with some hints of dark fruit and vanilla, but there was an interesting spiciness with some cinnamon and tobacco as well.  Interesting.

The taste was just as interesting, if not more so.  All of the above flavors were there, with chocolate malts and some vanilla along with dark fruit sweetness.  But its the finish that was the most intriguing with a spiciness from the chilies that actually melded pretty well with the underlying stout.

The mouthfeel was pretty full bodied with low carbonation and a tingly spiciness throughout.

3445,"2009-01-04",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 27, 2009 My second re-rate:  After having this again, I had to make it a perfect 5.  This beer is outrageous.

Thanks to Joey for the taste.  I would rate this higher than a 10 on flavor, if I could.  The chocolate flavor in this beer is over the top delicious.  It is strong, creamy and decadent with vanilla and cinnamon spices added in.  The peppers are sitting in the back, providing just a slight burn to let you know they are there.  The mouthfeel is thick and oily.  Swirling the beer around the glass leaves a light brown oil slick on the sides.  I simply cannot wait until this hits the market.  The chocolate flavor is a desert of its own.  Fabulous flavor.  Great job!
RE-RATE:  After the Cigar City Kickoff party, I had to bump my rate even higher.  This beer is amazing.  Was told the ABV was kicked up higher, to the 13%-14% range, but it doesnt show.  The flavors seem even more intense and the alcohol is hidden very well.  The chocolate in this beer tastes like the best gourmet chocolate Ive ever had in a beer.  No corners have been cut.  If I could drink on thing for the rest of my life, it would be this.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"
3445,"2008-12-31",4.9,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2009 Update after Atlanta Cask Ale Tasting. The Pasillo and Ancho  chilis really helped balance out the huge amount of chocolate that was in the first batch and tone down the vanilla just a touch. The alcohol was warming and played around in the back of your mouth with the heat from the chilis which was mild in intensity at first then gave way to a moderate amount of heat that complements the sweetness of the beer without being overly bitter. Very Nice!!!!!!!  Rating #1000. Pours black with a two finger mocha head that lasts leaving great lacing. Huge aroma of vanilla, chocolate, dark fruit, cinnamon, roasted malt, and tobacco.

3445,"2008-12-27",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 7, 2009 Update for the slightly higher octane (~13%) batch #3 brewed for the CCB launch party at Oldsmar Taphouse.  This stuff sold out in 15 minutes flat, and with good reason.  Everything mentioned below is still pertinent, but my 3rd go round with this beer just solidifies it as one of the best imperial stouts I have EVER tried.  It destroys any other chocolate stout out there.  Phenomenal, world class beer.Draft at the brewery, courtesy of Joey and Wayne.  This one pours as dark and viscous as any you will ever encounter, save perhaps Darklord.  Pitch black in color, with an ultra dense and lasting brown head.  Thick, foamy lace blankets the glass almost entirely.  Intoxicating aromas of melted dark chocolate, tobacco and vanilla greet the nose first.  Deeper contemplation reveals scorched caramel and faint pepper notes, with plenty of the requisite roasted malts and earthy hops to keep things in check.  The first sip confirms what the nose foreshadows... that this is one chocolaty mother of a beer.  The cocoa nibs have obviously done their job well, as this brew just screams with melted chocolate.  Caramel, sweetly pungent tobacco, vanilla, and hints of molasses are again countered with roasty notes and earthen hop bitterness, while the ancho and pasilla peppers and the cinnamon lend spicy background depth and complexity.  Big, slick, and oily in the mouth, the palate perfectly matches the other elements of this brew.  This is a kick ass beer, plain and simple.  I would not be surprised to see it amongst the hallowed forerunners of imperial stout.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
3445,"2008-12-24",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2009 Pours deep dark used motor oil with thin brown head. It has dark chocolate legs nearly staining the glass as I swirl the brew around. It has a moderately strength complex aroma of rich dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses, vegetable smelling hot spices and more chocolate. The taste is full of yummy rich dark chocolate. To start out the flavor experience it seems a little like a rich creamy dark chocolate milk shake with mild amounts of vanilla, molasses and tasty toastiness. The chili spices are meek and only at the just noticeable level for me. The chili spices could certainly use a bigger presence in the taste as well as the nose. The next sampling a few weeks later showed larger aromatic and flavor notes coming from the chili peppers. Even still, if they were to be a little bolder in the flavor profile it would be very interesting to experience. It is really damn good as is.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
