Fairly straightforward flavor. Lemony. A little bit of hay. No real funk or pepper to it. Simple, but pleasant. Sharp oaky lactic bite in the finish. An acidity lingers in the periphery, but doesnt become prominent until the very back end. 

Flat, but its still nice to drink, which surprises me. Light enough body to handle the lack of carbonation.

Pours an urine yellow color with no head at all, leaving the spotlight on the actual beautiful saturated, sun-yellow color. Developes a small film of lacing at the edge of the glass.

Has aromas of glue, old oak, leather and matured hops, bound together by ripe lemon. The beers tartness gets gently balanced by the dusty oak, together with funky tartness. The nose is actually quite simple, not one-dimensional, but straight-up convincing. 

Has a soft, very refreshing mouthfeel to it, based on the beers low carbonation. Opens up the palate to the brews pleasant tartness, with no distraction at all. Needs a moment of adjustment, then becomes a revelation.

Tastes of old hops among tart lemon, old wood and an incredibly well pronounced funkiness. Its tartness gets showcased perfectly, due to he very low carbonation. Reveals an almost fruity tartness during the finish, featuring crisp lemon and green apple peel, still balanced by the wood.

Its funkiness gets perfectly pronounced by the beers very low carbonation, while the oak lends enough character to prevent it from being boring. When I have had this the last time, it was younger and even lower carbonated, while this is by comparison almost sparkling, very refreshing.

M - Medium body with no carbonation at all. The lack of carb leads to a slick, slippery feel that flows freely across the palate.

4072,"2013-02-03",3.6,"750ml bottle purchased at west Lakevieq liquors. 2012 vintage... Releasing the cork yields a small pop and hiss following.  The liquid itself is a hazy orangey brown consistency without any remnants or sign of head.  Swirling reveals some legginess with light bubbles formulating but quickly disappearing... Aroma ideas sharp grape and acidic qualities with touches of wood and a modicum of must. Sour in a sense while exhibiting your mustvesic straight lambic essence at its core... Flavors display a continuation of the same with sharp tart grapes and oak focus with a mild degree of subtle bitterness working its way into the equation late. Lacking vibrancy and punch as a whole due to the lack of carbonation.  More wood surfaces in the finish as well.  Medium bodied overall with an almost absent level of carbonation, still and without life although the flavor profile is rather inviting and tasty.

A - Pours an obviously still clear golden yellow color. A few tiny bubbles form around the edge but pop quickly. A swirl wets the sides of the glass and creates some minute bubbles. Gorgeous beer.

S - Lemons lead into some strong musky notes of cheese, damp basement, and vinegar. Less fruity than the standard bio/classic gueuze. Really great if funk is your thing.

T - Lemon rind, sharp acidic vinegar, musky cheese, wet hay, wood and overripe apricots.The finish is of lingering funk. Strong and bold brettanomyces clash with a still body to create a really unique offering.

M - No carbonation. Medium body. Tart and dry on the finish. Very wine like.

Very mellow (naturally) compared to the young unblended lambic Ive had. Hint of sweetness, very earthy and the metallic taste is getting on my nerves a bit. END of glass (dregs) taste. WHOA. I had to come back to add some tasting notes for the end. Dregs arent clumpy at all. Just adds a darker cloudiness to the beer. Taste of the dregs is like candied apples! Very sweet, earthy and tart pear and candied apples taste. Its pretty remarkable. Dregs rarely taste better than the rest of the bottle. 

M - No carbonation, light body.

O - This is fantastic but also very confusing. I expected carbonation in this unblended lambic but its not there. Its not as if thats a bad thing but its jut unexpected. Very drinkable and this 750ML is no issue with finishing.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

This one has a lot of the same characteristics of their other beers.  Youll hear people say musky, funky, leather, etc.  It has all of this.  It also has kind of a rotten aroma.  Now you might say thats sounds horrible but it isnt.  Also some oak is mixed in with lemon and apples.  Not a huge smell here but decent.

Now this is where the beer fell apart for me.  I was really expecting a good amount of sourness or tartness here.  But it doesnt have any of that.  There is slight sourness.  Not the amount I was looking for though.  This honestly might be a great gateway beer into the rest of their lineup.  Especially for someone who really has not experienced a sour kind of beer.  Now the homebrewers out there who read this, is it not as sour because its unblended?  Do these lambics get more and more sour as you blend in other batches of lambics?  Back to the taste.  Mixed in with the small amount of sour, the biggest thing I picked up were apples.  What followed was some citrus, lemon, and white wine notes.  Overall decent, but kind of boring when it comes to  Cantillon.

Pours a moderate orange color with a thin white head and plenty of large bubbles when first poured. Even a hard pour cannot yield much of a head, though I wont really dock an unblended lambic on this point. Nose is moderately funky with some earth and a bit of hay. Theres a bit of lactic character there, but its not overpowering at all.

The flavor follows the nose quite closely. Theres some initial acidity followed by a bit of earth and very light funk. Mouthfeel is light with very low carbonation. Acidity is somewhat brisk but no terribly long-lasting. Drinkability is pretty nice. Had this with plenty of cheese and it served its purpose quite well.

No lacing...The aroma is really light, only gives off some musky horse blanket, a little boring...Taste is also pretty light, shows off lots of oak, spider webs, chalk, musky. Not very sour, a little but more bitter than sour if that makes sense. 

Maybe Im just not a fan of unblended beers, or this wasnt a great batch. Either way, this is the probably the least good Cantillon Ive had and cant imagine having this again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

4072,"2011-03-15",4.4,"750ml green corked and capped bottle.

It pours a clear orange with no head, just a bit of soapy bubbles that quickly pop. Great for a non-carbonated beer.

The smell is nothing but classic. It isnt as funky as other wild ales, but it is nice and tart with a huge lemony zestiness. There is a suprising amount of sweetness as well. The oak meshes it all together with a smooth vanilla like scent.

The flavor is very nice. It is a bit vinegary at first but it mellows out nicly. It isnt overly sour but there is a nice mouthpuckering sensation with the first few sips. The oak comes in with a nice woody note. There is a hint of spiciness to go along with the sourness and a slightly funky aftertaste. The oak is surprising here, it really shines with the lambic flavors.

I have only had 2 uncarbonated lambics, and this one is definitely the crown of the style. You somehow forget the carbonation, I think the acidity of it has to do something with that.

4072,"2011-03-14",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 21, 2017 Re-rate, March 2018: as I had noted in my original review, this was one I wanted to come back to, it just took a little longer than expected. 75cl bottle picked up at the brewery shop. It pours a clean golden color, completely flat with no head. Aroma is dry and lemony, full of barnyard funk and hay, with some acidic white wine vinegar notes in the finish. Taste is also mega dry and funky, with notes of basement dust, hay, light cheese and a white wine vinegar-like tartness. The finish is dry and softly bitter, like boiled hops bitterness. Medium body with no carbonation. Overall, quite good complexity for a lambic, will see how this evolves over time.
Original review, March 2011: 375ml bottle. Pours a cloudy orangish color. No head to speak of. Aroma is signature Cantillons, only some orders of magnitude less intense. Same applies to taste. The body in this beer is comparable to still water. No carbonation at all. Given others ratings I guess I got a wrong batch: flat body is not the problem actually, its the flatness in flavors which set this apart from all other Cantillons Ive had so far. Strange. Positive note: this means Ill have to come back to this one soon. Score 2.8","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"

But much better than drinking vinegar, of course. The tart sourness does not linger too long, and you can forget about it until you take another sip. Very drinkable. Very refreshing after a long day of brewing. Nice drink to unwind with.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"

Complex aroma of sweet strawberries, pineapple, malt, pickles, and promise of some woody bitterness. Hazy orange with only a partial ring of large bubbles--not a looker. Flavour is also complex--more so than the usual Lambic offering: almost mouth-puckering sourness and woody bitterness begin and then very quickly develop into a pleasant fruity blend that includes strawberries, pineapple, mango, and lotus root.

4072,"2010-03-19",4.0,"Bottle. 

Pours an almost glowing deep amber with some disparate airy bubbles that quickly disappears. 

The aroma is musty and earthy with notes of overripe apples and pears, lemon, leafs and Cantillons house character of funky barnyard, mud and hay. 

The flavor is medium sweet and lightly sour. Lots of aromas of overripe apples and pears. Tart lemon notes lead the way to a funky middle of mud, barnyard and leafs. A surprisingly noticeable bitterness goes well with a tightening tartness in the finish. Ends with tart lemon notes and mineral notes. 

Medium body and basically without carbonation, which makes it appear as having a bigger body than most beers from Cantillon. Not very dry either.

I mean, it has a strong vinegar note and citric tartness, but it didnt quite knock my socks off, like I was hoping for. It has certain qualities comparable to an unflavored kombucha. Flat.

4072,"2009-04-27",4.3,"2005 bottle, aged 4 years.  Each pour yields a body that is progressively more cloudy than the last, medium golden-amber in color, with a fleeting, off-white head of bubbles.  Theres virtually no lacing left behind.  The nose is nothing short of stunning, tart apricot showing as the dominant fruit component, with lemon essence, barnyard air, well-used oak, and hints of a dusty old house.  There are hints of nectarine sweetness in there to keep the citric acidity in check, but as refined as it is, theres still no mistaking this as one sour mother of a beer.  Flavors mirror the aroma, tart apricot and zesty lemon calmed ever so slightly by sweet nectarine and hints of juicy peach.  The brief respite from the sourness that the nectarine provides is quickly quashed as brash acidity attacks the throat on the swallow.  Funky oak imparts hints of vanilla and musty wood flavors. This stuff is so refreshing and drinkable, thanks in great part to the lightly carbonated, semi-dry acidity that comes through on the moderate palate.  There simply has to be a good amount of this exact strain in the Cantillon Cuvée des Champions, as the similarities are striking.  Fantastic lambic.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

4072,"2009-03-24",4.0,"750ml corked bottle. Lambic Bio 2006. BB September 2028.
Didnt occur to me until I read the label a bit more thoroughly that this was an unblended lambic. I was a bit suprised to see no carbonation on the body, but that explained alot!
Anyway, body is a flat shiny gold, only the slightest haze.
Plenty of tart apple straightup on the nose, unripe stonefruit and lemon rind in there, bit of hay, integrated oak and cheesy funk.
No carbonation which somehow brings a smile to my face, whereas the champagne-like carb of most lambics kind of makes drinking quite an effort. Lengthy palate, nice tongue-coating acid and tannin, with a balancing sweetness.
Lemons, unripe peach, sour apple all seem to emerge nicely on the body. Oak is smooth, lending a hint of vanilla and spice, bitter citrus peel seems to be a constant driving force throughout. Slight cheesy funk towards the finish. Finish is not nearly as brutal as other Cantillons, certainly not as vinegary, still quite tart yet balanced by a nice fruity sweetness.
I found this to be personally the most enjoyable Cantillon to date simply just because of its approachable nature. It still has the traits of a Gueuze, without the brutal carbonation and acid. One would argue its less complex, yes, but I can actually see myself sitting down and enjoying a bottle of this.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

750ml 2006 vintage uncorked by priapic cherub. Burnished gold with faint mist. You dont need me to tell you its as fizzless as apple juice, but that its as solidly bodied is a surprise. Complex sweet aromas of honey, lemon, lime, apple juice, glowing fireside single malt mellowed in oak fora couple of decades. Nothing especially barnyardy or acetic. Dustily clean, cleanly dusty. Some kind of antiseptic dentists waiting room note.  Almost apple bubblegum fruitiness, considering. Overwhelmingly honey. That this is conjured from the use of water, wheat, barley, dried hops, oak, and (not so) randomly floating wild yeast is a miracle of brewing in itself. Brewers of foul allegedly honeyed confections take note. Piques with acidity, but isnt ferocious. None of the heartburn tartness I was expecting. Not until the third glass, anyway. The years in wood and glass seems to have restored some of the mellow woodsy apple and lemon notes you might find in an unspicy dry witbier. Wheat and mildly puckering apple all the way. Honey and oak leaping out. Occasional swig of Brie creaminess, vanilla, peat. The mellowest, most complex, most delicious unblended lambic Ive tasted. Could savour it geekishly or glug it by the pint.

A dull grassy sourness, strawlike and quite plain, in the flavor, lacking even a hint of traditional confrontational funkiness right away; rather, its mostly a briny saltwater with a distant hint of fruit skins and leafiness.

Light-medium palate, watery and dusty; finishes with some gruyere rind, earthy salts, and maybe seaweed; certainly quite green and still salty, whatever it is.

It stays in this unpleasant state until swallowed, at which point the tongue is aglow in a sophisticated sweet and spiced alcoholic burn, and its worth the price of that initial flavor.

I had the chance to try this at the Buckeye Beer Engine during a special sour ale sampling.  It was worth every penny of the $3 I paid.  Given the cost for a full 750ml I probably wont be springing for one any time soon even if I could find it.  Even so if I happen to run across this again I will certainly not pass it up.

Aroma / Appearance - The honey colored body was flat and lifeless.  The scent of dry white wine tickled the nose along with an orange base, white grapes and an oaky base.  For a lambic it was very gentle.

Flavor / Palate - The tartness was not nearly as strong as I thought it would be.  Sour, dry and a little woody it was chewy and dense.  As expected it did dry out the throat.  Reminding me of a dry white wine it was excellent all the way to the final drop.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

To smell: a few Holstein cows graze on rich green grass. Downwind, vines loaded with unctuous spicy wild muscat grapes, bright in the fall sun and dusted in yellow goldenrod pollen. Sharp grapeskin musky tart bite. No, not quite right: there is a sharp flinty grapeskin quality to the flavor, but the tartness is actually quite soft. Esp for a Cantillon beer, which to my palate often push the acidity a bit far. Grass, iodine, salt. Very fine carbonation, just a hint of tiny peppery fizz.

Flat orange or light brown. The usual Cantillon fingerprint is easily detected on your nose, but this one is  mellower. Youre definitely facing a sour lambic, but this is very woody indeed, very soft and mellow. Its soft in the mouth despite the sharpness. Apricot is the most prominent taste, but theres the classic Cantillon lambic body backing that up, and it leaves an oaky woody and walnut-paper nutty finish. Classic Cantillon, but this is a little thin and watery as its too young. Must rerate in a couple of years.

To me, something like Rodenbach Grand Cru has so much more character and is so utterly quaffable.  The body is too thin, with just the faintest hint of fizz.  When held and swooshed in the mouth for too long, the finish resonates with something warm and uric.  Deep snorts in the goblet and it smells like an old piss pot.  This beer really, really sucks.

Huge sour in the nose along with aromas of apples and pears. Incredible tartness in flavor and more sourness in the finish with potatoes and pancakes. This starts out sour and loses tartness the longer its consumed. Unusually flat for most gueuze Ive tried besides the contaminated Lou Pepe I shared with SoLan.

4072,"2007-10-23",4.0,"Sample from a friend at Pizza Port bottle shop; Drank with Shawn and others.  $15. A real treat.  Low to no carbonation.  I was reading this is the nature of a true lambic, as the aging and use of Brett yeasts super attenuate the beer, leaving no sugar.  It is bottled this way. for Gueze, additional lambic is added with higher residual sugar, which ferments in the bottle to carbonate the Gueuze.  Thus lambics: uncarbonated, and gueuzes are carbonated.  Looks terrible:  very light yellow and flat.  I was surprized to find the lambic to have little sourness.  Possibly the souring yeasts were added late, or just provided by the barrel/air after sacc yeasts ate most of the sugar.  Very very easy to drink.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"

4072,"2007-07-02",3.4,"Sampled on Tap at Monks Cafe in Philadelphia.  Aroma was predominatly sour with a spicy, sweaty character.  This pour was pretty much still thus there was no head and the aormatics did not belie the flavor.  Flavor was dominated by  by the brett character with a earthiness and backed by a subtle light maltiness midpalate.  Sour acidic finish sets in and finish is very wine-like.  Mouthfeel is a mix of slightly slick residual sugar and drying acidity.  Wheat presence not necessarily noted but probably added a bit of richness.  Carbonation would make the beer a bit more excting on the palate.  Overall, a very sour, lambic beer that could have been better and  a bit richer, but still worth the sample, especially on draft!","Port Jefferson Station, New York, USA","Aeneas"
4072,"2007-06-30",4.1,"Bottle - cork says 2005. First glass pours clear amber with exactly no head and next to no carbonation. Looks like light apple juice. Subsequent pours are less clear due to yeast.

Theres a big aroma of funky yeasty barnyardiness from over a foot away - exhilirating. Theres also a fragrant perfume and a bit of wheaty zest in the nose.

The body is very round and wet. Not sweet at all. Quite tart, musty, elegant, bright. These characteristics hold steady through a long finish that picks up a bit of oak. Unsurprisingly, the sourness intensifies throughout the bottle. The taste echoes about the mouth and throat.

The beer is medium-to-light bodied and mellow with mineral traces and a drying finish. Would be wonderful with seafood or breakfast if it werent so good by itself.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","blueduk"

Consumed: May 2008
Sweet nose, relatively speaking of course, and not miles away from dessert wines based on botrytised semillon grapes. In fact the similarity is striking. Colour is certainly developed with darker apricot but this 9yr old beer. Palate is dead flat and shows great aged apricot and wine characters. Good tangy, spicy fruits throughout. Slight pong on the finish.
Vintage: 2003
Consumed: May 2007
Ok, I admit, I am a complete nuff when it comes to the style, but the completely flat palate effectively kills the beer for me. Strictly medium strength in terms of acid, sour fruits and intensity, particularly in the contex of a Cantillon offering. Orange apricot hue with no head. Sour and citrus fruits on the nose. Much more bitter and firm to taste; citrus and acid in abundance early, but the palate suffers from a chronic lack of fizz which flattens and dulls the palate. Flavours tail off as a result. Disappointing (yeah I know, unblended lambic should be flat).

4072,"2007-04-03",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2007 2005 bottle.Poured a lightly hazy orangey-yellow, no head, virtually no effervescence. A ton of funk in the nose, barnyard, wet horse, wet straw, with less prominent fruit notes such as persimmon, apricot, peach and something tropical like mango. Still, as in uncarbonated, which Im not too keen on, but I suppose thats to be expected for unblended lambic. Flavor is nicely sour/acidic, with a drying tannic finish which lingers just about forever, along with something vaguely floral. Moderately sweet up front, with a mild fruit showing, but the acidity quickly takes over. Regardless, its not an overly hard acidity, and it remains easily palatable.

4072,"2007-02-02",4.0,"Bottle from 2001 - Orange golden slightly hazy body, big bubbled white head; Great deep warm a little greasy nose, not as fresh as your usual Lambic, aroma: wet oak and horseblanket are the most predominant elements, sugared rotten apples and some fresh green fig peel behind, way back there is something fresh like green apples and orange juice and peel; The body has an almost oily texture, (almost) no carbonation, but lots of fresh fruity and lactic acids, it is actually a little bitter as well; It finishes very long, starting a bit slow almost thin, but soon evolving with a very balanced amount of lactic acids, again a small amount of bitterness, it has lots of aroma, more aged then fresh: overripe pear, overripe apple, cowshit, wet oak. Very special, I dont think I have ever smelled the ""classic"" lambic/geuze (horseblanket, cowshit etc.) notes as clear as in this beer.

4072,"2007-01-22",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2007 My favorite Cantillon so far (12 sampled as of January 2007). This is funk at its most mellow, at its most refined and certainly at the height of its glory. Pours a murky, oily looking beige/orange with not a hint of carbonation. Aroma is a knockout: gargantuan oak barrel, peaches, Vermentino grapes(awesome), grapefruit juice, lemon, pepper, leather and plenty of Brett. Barnyard funk of a lighter variety than as with typical Cantillon(or is this typical Cantillon?), I suspect because no carbonation is forcing it upward and out of the glass. The flavor is just as rich and outstanding. warmer now, more profound barnyard and sour notes arrive with a twisted fruit and noble hop character. Also detected are substantial lemon oils and a throttling oak taste that punishes and carresses my mouth all at once. Palate is as smooth as could be but for the funky bashing my taste buds are enduring. Finishes with a steady lingering sour ness that only subsides if I drink something else. This is definitely not a beer for the faint of heart or uninitiated of palate. Older versions have proven even more exciting and refined. Bad Ass.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Aroma is pure sour, with very little fruit aroma.  

Taste is significantly sour, with a mellow chardonnay grape flavor.  It is very tasty, and I prefer the 3-year-old mellowness of this beer to the geuze that I had before it.

Well, the only common beer with a ""900"" in its name is Camo 900, so lets do this instead. Besides, its symmetry: my first rating was Capitol 1900. Pours light yellowish brown, looking a bit like apple juice. No real head, but some pinprick bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. Smell is pretty nice. I expected lots of sourness, but more cidery notes with a bit of wood. But taste is where  the sourness comes in. Real brett sourness, no acid used here. Somehow a bit rubbery, then more of the crabapple cider. What else? Some butterscotch, mown hay thats actually tripping my allergies. Yep, there are those stale hops, and a big barnyard character. Reminds me of that Berliner Weisse toward the end.So what do I compare this to, if its likely the only unblended lambic Ill find outside of Belgium?

This had great promise to me from the info card at the store and the advise of the beer guy there. It poured fairly clear and with little head for a belgian, but so did the Rodenbach, maybe this is with the GC style. The color was a soft peach and the aroma was very good, although I am not sure how to accurately describe it, there is something different, something special about the aroma of Belgians. But, the flavor , while good, tart and twangy, was lacking a little. It was like it had good flavor but not enough of it. The flavor was too recessed, too subtle.

Kiwi, lemon, grapefruit and mostly pineapple make for a dynamic fruit salad. Horsey funk, salt, ink, lactic and big rubber tones make up for funk lovers.

Astringent and citric grapefruit/pineapple juice. Still body, juicy and funky. I expected more from my first unblended lambic experience..  Had a 2001 yesterday and once again, Im a bit unimpressed. First, its not very pungent at all this time with nowhere near the acidity level Im expecting in a Cantillon, this was a bit tart, moderately so at best and globally lifeless, not only in terms of carbonation absence, but also in its idiosyncratic constitution. It is very juicy, not as complex as I read and globally not so aromatic at all plus it doesnt play much on subtlety.

Actually, this really is beer 1001 due to having two at lunch today, but Ive held onto this thing for a year and a half now intending it to be beer 1000, heck if Im not going to enter it as 1000 now!  Picked this up at Cantillon, 2003 bottling.  Pours still as promised, pale apple juice appearance with lots of tiny floaties.  This thing threw quite a sediment in the bottle as well.  Aroma was sheer barnyard, tart and aggressive.  Flavors  revolved around barnyard, mushrooms, very faint cheddar, tart green apples and a bit of wood.  Piercingly sour, and dry as a bone on the finish.  Pure lambic in nature.  My only complaint is that it was a bit thinnish, and the finish was extremely short.

Pours a still, pale, rose-tinted, gold. Beautifully vibrant but not bright, slight haze as well as ""bits"" of something hanging in the glass (looks like gold dust).  No head at all.  A suds-like, powdery looking, film sits on top at first but clears away completely within a minute or so.  Lime, pollen and apple peel on the nose initially, follwed by a musty ""under stair"" or ""attic"" aroma.  No sweetness at all left in this liquid after 6 years fermenting and conditioning, a big sourness initially that is followed by a strong, citrus, bitterness through the middle and very complex, dry, leathery, finish.  Suck a lime, swallow some grapefruit and chew your belt - youll get some impression.  Soft, oily, mouthfeel. Some powdery residue the only real negative for myself (a self-confessed lover of sour and bitter!).
Wow, an amazingly beer.  One, however is enough.  As Fritha said ""It tastes like its good for you"".  Soon after she complained of stomach churning.  If it tastes like vinegar youve eithr got a bad bottle or a problem with your palate.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","yalnikim"

It must be said that the beers lack of carbonation is very pleasant on the tongue. Beer is VERY dry, somewhat sour and tart. Lacks the strong woody flavours that many lambics have, some wood character was still discernable. This has a definite quality of dry cider to it.

4072,"2004-10-05",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2005 Bottled 2003. Not completely still, but almost so. Clear gold colour. Crazy funky aroma dominated by a toasted sesame seed aroma quite reminiscent of Sesame Wheat biscuits. Theres also a bit of garbage water and olives. Loads of crazy shit going on, but whilst it smells good, I dont think its great. Starts with a light, brief sweetness, then becomes sour, then bitter and salty in the end. Loads of bitter blue cheese flavours and quite a vinegary, salad dressing sourness. Some astringent woody flavours too. Quite a rough flavour, but not as sour as Rosé de Gambrinus. Loads of really great flavours, but Im not sure it all melds in together like it should. The bitterness particularly clashes with the sourness, which is sometimes good, but often annoying. I must say I dont really get the single malt comparison at all. For what its worth, this was quite a lot like my own home-brewed pLambic, only a lot more sour, so that at least made me feel good. Got a couple of bottles going into the cellar, hopefully in a couple of years this will be awesome. RR: Label says 1999, cork 2003 - weird. This seems a fair bit thinner and sharper than the fresh lambic. Vinegary salad dressing, dried apricots and toasted sesame seeds. Kind of a hard mouthfeel, and quite bitter. It seems a bit out of balance for mine, though the aroma is still pretty incredible.

Marvelous, golden, peachy color, hazy as she comes, with no head to speak of...nose is sour, lemony, musty, a bit of vinegar and orange peel, and some spiciness...and stil a little dry...some complex stuff, so far!
Oooo! Sourness grips the tastebuds, claws fast like an eagles talons as it hits the tongue, bumps and climbs and cavorts all over the palate, one restless little brew we have here....it mellows some, plays gamely in the mouth afterwards and settles, sour has put down its pistols and is laying it out lightly now...but, with each subsequent sipping, the dance begins again, a blitz of a ballet in the mouth, a whirl of a dervish...

4072,"2004-05-12",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2005 2001 Bottle at the Art of Beer Fest 2004.  Pours a magnificent bright goldenrod, with red tinges, and dark brilliant oranges. Like polished copper.  No head, but some wisps of lacing on the edges.  Aroma is intense and incredible (as usual from this brewery).  Cider vinegar, oak, cedar, huge sour yeastiness, salt, sugar and maybe a hint of light molasses.  Aroma is so superb and full it really sets my expectations high (as if they werent high enough already).  Upon first sip, I think two things right away.  1)  This is really good, authentic tasting lambic that is neither too sour/dry. 2) Wow, this body is very loose and lightly watery.  Perhaps the age of it creates a lot thinner mouthfeel, but thats what it seemed.  As far as the flavor though, it paralleled the aroma quite well.  Deep apple cider meets belgian yeast and oak.  This is the best oak flavor Ive tasted in a beer.  Lots of light fruit esters, good lingering sourness on the finish, quite cheesy at the end as well, though in a sweetish/sour sort of way.  Wow this was intersting stuff.  I just wish the body would have held up better.  I can hardly wait to try the bottle in my cellar and rerate.  10/5/8/4/162003 bottle  While I dont hold it against the beer for being flat, as thats to style, this particular vintage seemed very underwhelming.  Much looser body than the older vintage I had (strange) with less oily, oaky complexities.  Yeast sourness is still present, of course, but the usual funky, cheesy nuances of Cantillons lambics seem less accentuated here.  Still, I give them credit for bottling a style that is not terribly suited to the bottle. 8/5/7/3/14On draught at Redbones, 4/14/05!!!  Wow, to say I was excited to try draught unblended lambic is a vast understatement.  Being somewhat disappointed by the 2003 bottle, I wasnt sure how it would be.  However, this was superb.  Flat, yet not lifeless, there is a slight tingling sensation as you drink the beer.  The aroma was full of brett, citrus, lemon sorbet and rich, well-oiled leather.  Flavor is a mountain of brett, more oily leather tannins, with lightly sweet malt, sweet apples and sour, yet tantalizing bacterial nuances.

4072,"2004-02-02",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 17, 2004 Bottled 2002, Sampled February 2004
The cork pulls with an apparent lack of carbonation.  An immediate sour musty aroma wafts from the bottle.  When poured into my glass the complete & total lack of carbonation is quite apparent.  Cool just like having a traditional Lambic straight from the barrel.  The aroma is of course dominated by sour acidic notes but there is an apparent woody aroma and a sharp note of urea as well.  The beer itself is a hazy light orange color, and because of the non-existent carbonation there is no head at all.

Strong notes of grapefruit are in the taste of this beer.  At first I did not think this beer was all that acidic, but as the beer moved past the front of my mouth the full acidity of this Lambic kicked in.  This beer has a very light body, which is accentuated by the lack of carbonation.  I get notes of bergamot in the middle, and notes of tannin in the finish.  This beer has the full suite of funky Lambic characteristics, though the musty-leather/ barnyard character is perhaps a bit subdued compared to some others.  There are some notes of a good stinky French farmhouse cheese, as well as some woody funky-wild mushroom characteristics in my glass.  This particular bottle of Lambic is not all that acidic compared to most of the Cantillon range.  It is of course surprisingly sour at first, but, unlike most, the acidity seems to reign in after a bit.  This is so complex, you can sip and try & dissect all of the competing flavors until the end of your glass, then you wish you had more because you feel like there were a couple of things that you missed.

This is a great (and one of the few) examples of a traditional Lambic.  This beer is one of the few chances for most to sample an unblended Lambic, and for this alone Cantillon is to be applauded.  I do like this beer quite a bit.  A bit of warning though, these flat bottles of Lambic need to be served warmer than usual, about 60*F (15*C), as I find uncarbonated Lambic needs to be a bit warmer than usual in order to fully express it's charms.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4072,"2003-04-04",3.3,"Cloudy orange. Citric aroma. None of the horse blanket that I was expecting. Dry and winey. Very tart. I think one of the tastebuds on the side of my tongue just exploded!","San Francisco, California, USA","mwsf"
4072,"2003-03-05",4.1,"Body is dull medium-light amber. The head forms easily and fades easily. The aroma is mulch or the loam in a forest, hint of horse blanket and ripe citrus or peach. The flavor: Basalmic vinegar and cotton candy (minus the sweetness). Salt and really thin, sour kumquats or oranges that aren't quite ripe yet, a little orange peel as well. A bit bitter in the finish. Is tart, but not as harshly tart as the Hanssens Oude Gueuze I had a few days ago. I didn't care for it to start with, but the more you drink, the easier it gets.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
4072,"2003-02-23",4.5,"One of the last 1999 bottles at the brewery - an exceptional, JP Van Roy says. He isn't far wrong. Golden colour, no head (3 yr. old lambic!). Nose of aged oak wood, of old leatherbound books in an antiquariat and of wild mushrooms. taste gives more wood, tannines, unbelievable but there is some unfermented thing underneath and sherrywood casks. The finish is made up by all the volatiles from the above retreating. A dream of a beer...","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
4072,"2003-01-12",3.1,"Strong pungent nose that is at the same time fruity and dusty. Light hazy orange color and no head or carbonation at all in our sample we bought directly at the brewery in Brussels. Not surprisingly this has a very tart taste that recalls grapefruit. The lack of carbonation left the overall texture flat and was more juice-like than beer.","GERMANY","pivo"

Very small, white creamy head. Good lacing. Teh flavor is very very tart up front. Lightly bitter and still very tart on the backside. Lemon, Grapefruit, woodsy and earthy notes.
Very dry mouthfeel with fizzy carbonation. Extremely dry and tart finish.  I really liked this lambic, but its not for everyone. In the dictionary, next to TART and DRY, there is a photo of a bottle of this lambic. Lambic fans must give this beer at least one try.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

4072,"2002-10-16",3.8,"I was not as impressed with this as I was expecting to be.  It  was not as tart and complex as other lambics, even the regular Cantillon.  It may have had a bad cork.  When I pulled the bottle cap off that was over the cork, I could see beer bubbling out from around the cork.  But I am not sure if this would affect it, as it also had the bottle cap sealing it.  And it had lots of carbonation and a good head. Anyway, how the heck do you tell if a lambic is bad???","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"

Nose of sour apples, barnyard, grass and candy; flavor almost as intense and complex, extraordinarily sour, woody and smoky.  Vinegar seems present in the nose and flavor as well, but this didnt bother me; guess Im getting used to these.  Smoothes out just a bit as it warms.  Extraordinary; cant wait to try more Cantillon.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

Absolutely no head, tried to pour it from a high distance, but still, no head!!!! Very interesting, very sour, and very stinky barnyard character, pretty mental beer, but amazingly good.(4.4)
Re-rate: sublime. seriously juicy, sour stinky lambic, this is much better than my previous rating (above). Really well balanced aswell, nothing felt out of place. Nice sour attack on the tongue, really dry aswell, left me wanting more after every sip (draught- GBBF 03')","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
4072,"2002-07-17",4.6,"Absolutely brutal.. I was expecting a flat beer but was greeted by a big but ephemeral white rocky head of foam. Color is a beautiful full golden. Aroma is of oak and baryard. The first impression is the brutal, in-your-face sourness. It is the first beer that truly makes my mouth pucker. While your face contorts in agony of the extreme acidity, you can feel the taste of oak, grapefruit, white wine, and even a slight saltiness. The finish on this beer will also introduce to you the true meaning of dryness. This is certainly not a beer for wimps. It is also an undisputed world classic, and one of the best beers Ive ever had in my life.","Virginia, USA","FlemishChar"
4072,"2002-06-21",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2003 2001:  Immense amount of dense, white foam which turns rocky and sticky.  Classic sharp/sour aroma is dominant alongside minerals, underlying mustiness, bandage, candle wax, wood, and dryish.  No barnyard here in this fresh bottle.  Before this gets a chance to roll around my mouth I was smacked by the inevitable and whalloping sourness.  Metallic, extremely dry, semi-complex, medicinal, very vinous, and very acidic.  This is entirely too fresh. I made the mistake by drinking this on an empty stomach.  The thought of this, paired with a fine cheese or dinner, is tantalizing. Perhaps I would have known that, if it was not for the mindless vintagers stamping the date uselessly on the cork.  Am I missing something here or am I just an oblivious fool?","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
