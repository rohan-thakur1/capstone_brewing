4097,"2010-07-24",4.0,"Tap at IH Pville.  Pours a hazy golden orange with a smaller bubbly white head.  Aroma of
Brett, tropical fruits, tart cherries and funk.  Flavor of Brett, barnyard funk and
Tart fruits.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
4097,"2007-11-12",3.0,"GABF 2007.  Pours a transparent gold with a small head of filmy off-white.  Acetic, vinegary nose with some cheesy funk and fermented lemons.  Plenty of funk, but it has this heavy, plodding feel to it rather than being light and bright.  Tart flavors of barnyard and sweaty hay up front, before retreating to a cereal grainy finish thats left a little ""blah"" on the palate.  A little too heavy on the vinegar acidity, and not light or crisp enough with its tartness.  Not bad, but it kind of falls off a bit in the finish.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
4097,"2007-11-01",3.5,"(Draught)  Pours a clear yellow body with a small white off-white head.  Aroma of earthiness, sweaty, light citric sourness, and barnyard.  Flavor of grapefruit, almonds, earthiness, brett funkiness, cheese, and light pineapple.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
4097,"2007-10-19",3.5,"GABF 07.  Pours clear yellow with a small, frothy, white head, lasting with good lacing.  Aroma is average malt (hay, straw), average hops (herbs, citrus), average yeast (horse blanket) with notes of apple.  Medium bodied, creamy texture, soft carbonation, and a bitter finish.  Average duration, light sweetness, moderate acidity, and heavy bitterness.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"

4097,"2006-07-24",3.4,"Bottle shared by Egajdzis and draught samples at BCTC 06.Lucid gold with strong brass overtones, though not too dark as American ""lambics"" are apt to be.  Sediment has settled, but a slight haziness is present from being disturbed somewhat.  Head is small, rather fleeting, white in color and provides some light patchy lacing.Very fruity nose; estery and tinged with light pediococcus suggestions that give it a slight sour sharpness on the end.  Not overly lactic, though there is a bit of a dry, cheese-rind-like note to it.  Wheat adds some blandness and the fruitiness hangs on until the end, aided by a touch of very light brett tartness.  No diacetyl apparent from the nose (or little of it anyways), no butter at least, maybe a dull, old popcorn sort of thing going on, but its hard to tell where the dry wheat notes end and the diacetyl begins.  The fruitiness provides most of the complexity, with the dry, lightly sour yeastiness in the background.  Not the most complex sample of lambic, but nor are there major flaws as many American samples contain.Fruitiness translates well to the flavor, though a hard lactic buildup is quite persistent, drying out the flavor immensely and giving a hard bite on the end.  A touch of apples, but mainly limes, lemons and even some melon or strawberry suggestions.  Wood is quite under-represented here (is this even wood-aged?), though Im no huge fan of heavy wood aging, so it bothers me little.  Diacetyl is noticeable, though in some of the smallest levels Ive tasted in an American version, especially one that has sat in the bottle for some time, where it seems to develop or become more pronounced.  Certainly if not looking for it, you can almost completely disregard it.  Mouthfeel is tired, with very low carbonation, but the beer is not watery, relatively speaking.  A fine attempt and an enjoyable American version.  The finish is a little problematic as the fruitiness evolves quickly in to oily pediococcus sourness, mixed with hard lactic dryness.  Tannin/phenol levels are a bit too disruptive, but this is just extreme criticism and problems that are probably unavoidable when brewing outside of Payottenland.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4097,"2006-07-17",3.8,"BCTC - Hazy gold with a hint of orange, with a quickly diminishing head - wonderful, sour and barnyardy/funky nose - for a straight lambic, I sense a lot of fruit in the flavor - mostly apple, but a hint of pear also - slightly acidic, but nothing overpowering - sour, but not in the way the classic european ones are, making this very approachable and good for an introduction to lambics for the inexperienced - very earthy, more so than most other American-made belgian style ales Ive had - quite nice.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
4097,"2006-03-12",3.4,"A unclear dark orange beer with a disappearing white head. The aroma is sweet acidic with notes of grapefruit. The flavor is also acidic with notes of grapefruit - but compared to the real Belgian lambics this is very mild. The flavor also contains light notes of wood.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
4097,"2006-02-23",3.5,"(Bottled 35,5 cl) Very unclear amber with a creamy, off-white head. Fruity, slightly tart nose. Medium body with a carbonation unusually high for the style. Quite fruity flavours with a touch of caramel and a light acidity. Refreshing and quite interesting, but not really close to its Belgian counterparts. 160206","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"
4097,"2006-02-18",3.7,"Bottled: Orange coloured. Unclear. Beige head. Sweet, acidic and quite fruity aroma. Very dry and very sour. Flavour as well is very sour and acidic. Has a balanced sweetness to it. This is a very nice brew, eventhough its not the best lambic Ive ever tried.","Søborg, DENMARK","madsberg"
4097,"2006-02-16",3.7,"Bottled. Thanks Eric! Hazy orange coloured. Acidic aroma with some sweetish fruity notes. Sour and sweet flavour with notes of fruits and barnyard. Dry finish with faint notes of yeast. High carbonation level for the style. More sweet and fruity than the best Belgian examples of the style.","København, DENMARK","Hildigöltur"
4097,"2005-12-25",4.7,"secret bottle stash from brewer L.H., december 05.  The best beer you cant get!  Luxurious pillowy head over a rich golden beer that had dropped completely bright.  Great funky barnyard aroma, smells like Orval (thats been stored properly) but ""barnyardier"".  Agressively sour nose hints of pear, pineapple life-savers, did I mention sour?  Spritzy carbonation give allusion of light body, but this no small beer.  Brewer confides this actually a 8.7% beer.  Spicy zip of peppery alcohol complements the earrthy, dirt finish with awesome puckering tart, paradoxically clean finish.  If you can manage to find a bottle of this, itll make your year.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","tallmatt67"
4097,"2005-09-24",3.3,"smells sour and fruity.  i think cherries and a hint of lemon. cloudy golden color.  not bad","Asheville, North Carolina, USA","scoobyluv"
4097,"2005-08-05",3.8,"BCTC 05.  Very cloudy hazy pour with not much head- probably due to the cold serving temp.  Aroma is very sour, with lots of barnyard notes and citrusy.  Lots of brett in the flavor- horseblanket, earthy, moldy, slightly skunky and lots of acid all around.  A bit fruity as it warms form the cold temp, and finishes rather dry but nice and refreshing on a really hot and humid day.  A good way to start off the fest for me.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
4097,"2005-07-29",4.1,"Hazy blonde pour, lasting small white head. Surprisingly bretty nose, heavily sweaty, strong hay character. This feels surprisingly authentic, the nose is tart and lactic, lemony and farmy, wow! Good acidity level, perfect lactic and lemon match, dry palate, yogurty, very well integrated, plenty of brett and yeast nuances. Delicious pineapple reminiscent finale. This is certainly an excellent base for their other acclaimed lambics which I cant wait to try. Light bodied, fair light carbonation. Splendid.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4097,"2005-07-19",3.3,"(Draught) Sampled at the Belgium Comes To Cooperstown 2005 in Cooperstown, NY. Pours a cloudy golden body with a medium, white head. Farmhouse and pineapple. Average.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
4097,"2005-07-17",3.7,"tap at Ommegang, 2005. Cloudy yellow, thin white head. Pineapply aroma, with a little sour farmhouse mixed in. Malty funky sweet and sour flavors. Nice and refreshing.","Good Beer Bar Deprived, New Jersey, USA","MaiBockAddict"
4097,"2005-07-17",3.6,"BCTC.  Wait..  this is a lambic.. from Pennsylvania?!?  Funky wheat lemon nose.  Sweeter than the festina lente but still a bit of pucker.  A bit of grape in the finish.  If asked to compare this to something else Id say Cuvee Renee.  NICE!","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"
4097,"2005-05-16",4.3,"North Wales.  This one didnt come with the sampler, and I almost had to bribe the bartender to get a sample.  Hazy gold pour with medium fizzy white head.  Aroma of Brett, sour gueuze, candi sugar, citrus, fruit, hay, peat.  Tastes sour, Bretty, gueuzy, fruity, with a sour twang at the finish, along with some earthy peat and dusty yeast esters.  Not nearly as sour as the Cantillon offerings, and for my money this one has a better mouthfeel and balance.  Ill stack this one up there with the finest Belgians.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
4097,"2005-04-24",4.3,"On tap at Wilmington as part of their Belgian Beer Fest (brewed at the North Wales location). Poured a cloudy, murky, dark golden color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas and tastes of horseblanket and light fruits. Nice sour finish. I really enjoyed this one.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
4097,"2005-04-24",4.4,"Wow this was the winner at the Iron Hill Belgian Fest. A murky yellow appearance with a good deal of carbonation. The aroma is funky and dusty with some citrus mainly lemons. Flavors of grapefruit, vinegar, hay, and cheese. A tart aftertaste. Good stuff.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
4097,"2005-04-24",3.8,"Poured a cloudy gold with a brownish tint, a rim of white head around the sides of the glass.  Aroma is musty and cheesy, with some tart fruit.  Flavor is mildly sour, but big on sweetness.  Biting carbonation.  Very tarty in the back of the throat, some hints of raspberry, also some cobwebs and more cheesiness.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","desurfer"
4097,"2005-04-24",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2009 Poured a cloudy, opaque yellow color with a small, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of funky brett, horseblanket, and vanilla.
