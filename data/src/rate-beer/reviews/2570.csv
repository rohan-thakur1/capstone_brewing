2570,"2016-10-23",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2016 Sweet, grassy, deep woods aroma. Fairly complex flavor with fresh grain, a little orange liqueur, and caramel. There is a lingering, cooling bitterness in the finish. I do wonder what makes this a traditional ale and not some type of pale ale. Another very good VT beer.","USA","Slipstream"

The taste has the same mango or juicy fruit flavors with a mild to moderate bitter ending.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"

2570,"2016-02-25",3.4,"Bottle. Pours golden orange with a thin white head.Aroma of pine & citrus. Flavor was lightly bitter with pale malts, pine, citrus and light fruit.","Croydon, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerdedone"
2570,"2015-09-17",3.7,"This was poured into a nonic pint glass.
The appearance was a soft hazy orange color with a light transparency about it. Subtle carbonation is seen rising at a moderate pace. There was about a fingers worth of subtle white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Lacing was few and far between.
The smell started off dried pine bitter and sweet through nice crisp tones.
The taste was basically the same as the aroma with a semi-dry to crisp aftertaste leading to a decent bitter bite in the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionable feel to it. Carbonation hits the spot allowing the bitterness to be the harshness hitting my tongue appropriately.
Overall, as an AIPA it works. Id have this again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
