3542,"2015-11-15",4.0,"Bottle about 6 months old. Lightly cloudy ruddy orange. Low carbonation. I swore Paradox would never get another dime of my money after how they handled their infectatorium, err brewery, after I got infected and they decided they would make sours exclusively but so many people raved about the earlier version of this (#15?), I finally pulled the trigger. Nose is watermelon rind and flesh, some lacto funk. Taste is salted watermelon, finishing dry with lingering salt and lacto funk. This is actually really delicious and I wish I had bought more in the summer. But I cant in clear conscious open my wallet to this brewery on a regular basis after how they denied numerous raging infection problems in their beers for so long.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"

3542,"2015-09-24",4.4,"From notes. Enjoyed on September 19 at Travis house. Poured from a 500 mL bottle. The pour is a straw yellow color with a nice cap of white head that falls to a collar, leaving nothing behind. The aroma is pretty good. You get a nice watermelon character with a nice tartness to it. There is a little wet oak and maybe a touch of graininess on the back end. The flavor is good. It reminds me of a watermelon flavored WarHead. I loved it. Need to find some of those babies to buy. The mouth feel is thin, crisp, but sharply carbonated and beautifully done. The aftertaste is lingeringly sour watermelon with just a kick of salt. Really, really good.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
