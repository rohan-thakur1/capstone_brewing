Light grassy hops. Hazy ruddy amber colored body with a medium light tan head. Starts with a grassy and herbal bitter hop flavor. Fair caramel malts in the middle, but then more bitterness comes in the finish. Quite hoppy.

2352,"2017-03-25",4.4,"Picked this one up after really enjoying Maine Beer Co.s MO last week. This one is another example of this brewery getting away with deservedly charging 7-8 bucks for a 16.9 oz bottle. It is quite simply the best amber ale type thing ever; although classified as such, it seems in a class all itself. It has a robust rich piney divine smell to it and looks like a fuzzy red panda. It tastes like a resiny malty vision from on high blasting you with hoppy goodness and a brown backbone. Im granting this an elusive 4.4. Good for lazy Saturdays with too cold baths and disco jams.","New Haven, Connecticut, USA","meccahh69lol"

2352,"2016-05-02",3.6,"Draught at Luckys, 4/8/16.A glassy, ruddy amber body has a strong blonde tint and a moderate sized, light beige head atop with moderate to strong retention.Fruity hops give off strawberry, raspberry and very light pineapple-like notes, as the specialty malts mix in to add soft caramel, brown bread and such. Pretty well-balanced between the two, though tending hoppier unsurprisingly, with pine and red grapefruit picking up as the beer warms, especially on the finish. Fresh yeast and no alcohol or flaws.In the mouth its bitter, not intensely so, but what Ive come to expect from MBC. The fruitiness of the hops here, along with a fair amount of honey-caramel sweetness from the malt is enough to entertain and balance, at least initially. As the pint goes on, breadiness and light sourdough from the specialty malt, as well as pine/resin definitely build up on the palate. Probably a bit too much for me to ever drink more than one, but well-made no doubt. Could use a little less bready-sourdough character (none would be perfect). Tightly carbonated though and clean.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2352,"2016-02-24",4.1,"BOD 1/5/16. Pours dark amber which turns a brilliant clear dark ruby under intense light. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

Outstanding, but a bit light, complex nose of citrus, pith, hints of dark fruit (fig, raisin), pine and a touch of caramel over a malt base with strong dark toasted notes.

Almost heavy medium body that is quite smooth and has a nice touch of creaminess to it. Superb carbonation with a fair burst of effervescence in the middle and a finely bubbled prickly finish.

The flavor profile is outstanding. Flavor arrives in a blended fashion that has minimal separation. It has the flavors of the nose, with dark toasted grainy malt being the most evident part of the base. Dark fruit (prune) and citric pith are the main components with a touch of pine arriving in the very mildly bittered middle. Balance is achieved with little perceived sweetness and has a very subtle caramel note. The finish is a slow fade of prune and pith.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

Spicy pepper and mild pine add a slight kick to it. The mouthfeel is firm, with a medium-to-light body and adequate carbonation. The taste is hoppy bitter, with implied malty sweetness. Peppery, piney flavors give way to mango peel and grapefruit as the beer goes down, for a green, dry, slightly earthy aftertaste.

Le liquide na pas encore traversé mes lèvres quil me désaltère déjà! En bouche lensemble est très homogène quoiquun côté très sec à cette bière coupe court dans les saveurs et la bière se retire rapidement pour laisser derrière elle une traînée plutôt âcre et une sensation légèrement râpeuse sur ma langue.

Slight grain dust in the finish and a hint of roastiness (medium-light roast coffee). Still, worthy of an ""India"" something or another.

2352,"2014-11-15",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 17, 2014 Reddened amber pour, softly cloudy; quite beautiful. Pine sap, pink grapefruit, caramelized onion and toffee aroma; classic in its adherence to decade-old desireable traits in darker IPAs. It is, however, markedly cleaner and more mineral-oriented than any to which it might be compared. Different colors of spice add nuance, with red bell pepper and black peppercorns.

Blood orange rind, pine needles, graham cracker malt flavor; crisp, woodsy, neatly organized. The shallot and dark, sweet tea malt flavors I dont care for are firmly present, and they arent explicitly muted by some other expressive, overriding flavor. Rather, its an impression of briskness, like windy autumn leaves rather than astringent sugared tea. Remarkably surprising.

Dry caramel like texture in a somewhat heavy, style specific mouthfeel, but with cuttingly crisp carbonation. Aromatic, woodsy sweetness lingers for a brief moment in a semi-dry finish.

2352,"2014-08-07",3.9,"I poured a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 7/22/14 and cost $6 ($0.36 per bottle).

Appearance: Beautiful mahogany/maroon shade. Fairly clear body. Pours to a huge, off-white, frothy head which laces and retains wonderfully.

Smell: Strong hoppy sensation of flowers and a hint of berry or other fruity scents.

Taste: I always say Im not a fan of amber ales, but there are certain examples of the style that really impress me and Maine Beer Zoe is a great example of what I mean. As is typical of the brewery, the hops are prominent here, though the malt base is a bit more vital to the palette of this beer than of their IPAs. Id prefer it to be more balanced, but whats here is delectable indeed.

Assertive bitterness from beginning to end, with a taste of flowers, pine, and a hint of tea or herbal sensation (due to the Simcoe, Columbus and Centennial hops, respectively). The brewerys website list seven different malts, though the actual palette is not quite as complex as youd think. Marris Otter gives is a touch of English character, with slight cherry flavor. Theres a light confectionery sweetness hiding in the background thats noticeable if you look for it. Otherwise, the hops carry the load and impart tasty bitterness and give it a slightly astringent, resin-like taste on the back end. Whats here is enjoyable to be sure, though a more truly balanced brew would be amazing Ill bet.

Drinkability: Zoe would seem to be a hefty beer at 7.2% ABV, however, it drinks like something smaller and more mainstream. The mouthfeel itself is soft, smooth and creamy  not quite as crisp as most ambers. The hops do linger and leave a minor dry bitterness on the tongue, but its easily tolerable. I could see this being quite versatile when it comes to food pairings.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

2352,"2014-03-02",3.2,"500mL bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a very dark yet cloudy copper color. Theres about one fingers worth of off-white colored head, and its beautifully textured. It retains itself acceptably, as well.

S: Its about what I expected from an amber, no more, no less. Which is disappointing, considered I expected this to be a big step up from the Fat Tires of the world. There is a strong caramel note from the malt backbone, along with lesser notes of toffee and earth. The hops here are primarily piny and serve to balance the malt. It is a decent aroma...but wow, I really expected this to be great.

T: Malts hit the tongue immediately, with a ton of toffee and caramel. This backbone gradually fades to allow some of its hop flavor to shine: mostly pine, with just a hint of grapefruit and herbs. While the flavor profile is sadly average, it does seem to have a touch of depth - like suggestions of chocolate or brown sugar, for instance.

M: The mouthfeel is what sets it apart from the gaggle of mediocre ambers out there. It is superbly clean and crisp, which that makes this one really drinkable. Carbonation is nice and zesty, too. The lingering sweetness on the palate is kept to a minimum.

O: Disappointing, apart from the great mouthfeel. Its definitely not a bad beer at all, though - and it grows on me the more I drink it. Still, this kind of money for a 500mL bottle of beer thats only slightly above average kind of hurts.

Carbonation is spot on. Mouthfeel is a bit less than medium, but there is a good creaminess with it too that brings it up a good level.

Had this one on my wants for a while since hoppy ambers are my favorite style. I was not let down. Very complex flavor profile. I would love to compare one of these to a fresh Nugget Nectar next spring.","Indiana, USA","jmarsh123"

A: Pours a ruby red color with a sandy colored head forming on the pour. Stays thick and heavy throughout and slowly recedes down the glass leaving behind sticky trails of lace.

S: Hoppy upfront with some notes of pine and dried grass. The malt backbone is pretty sweet in a caramel-esque way with a touch of roast as well.

The beer is reddish copper with a lasting tan head. The aroma offers hops, pine, caramel malt. Lightly sweet. Bread, biscuits, and malty body with a stinging bitter finish. Pine lingers in the back.

2352,"2013-08-14",3.8,"Its easy to walk by beers by the Maine Beer Company without noticing them; their inconspicuous labels blend them in to the background of the beer store. That said, their beers are almost universally praises, almost all of them sporting 95+ scores on Ratebeer. I decided to grab one at the beer store to celebrate the weekend and see whether or not the scores are justified.

Appearance (5/5)
Zoe is an attractive beer in the glass, thats for sure. It pours a deep amber color with a touch of ruby, and the thick khaki head is reminiscent of the head on a root beer float. A big thumbs up right from the start.

Aroma (9/10)
This doesnt really smell like an amber ale. When I pick up an amber, I usually expect primarily malt notes with maybe a trace of hop presence. This, on the other hand, has that malt body and backbone, but it is balanced with an intense pine and resin hop character that stands out prominently.

Taste (15/20)
Based on the appearance and the aroma, I was ready to be absolutely floored by Zoe. Up front, there is a sticky resin and pine hop character that is to be expected based on the aroma. This makes way to a predominantly malty middle with a noticeable nut flavor. It finishes off with a bitter, smoky aftertaste that lingers, but not entirely in a good way. This is, without a doubt, a bold amber/IPA hybrid, and the beginning of the flavor profile supports the rave reviews, but the smoke and nut in the finish doesnt work well for be with the resin notes. Its good, but not amazing.

Drinkability (3/5)
I was conflicted between thinking this was a beer I could drink many of and one that I had to take my time with. Based on the beginning of the palate, the aroma, and the appearance, Id give this a 5, but the finish drops it down for me.

Intangibles (6/10)
I can see why people speak highly of Maine Beer Company, and this beer has made me want to try more of their beers, but there was something about this that doesnt blow me away. That and there is the fact that a single bottle of the stuff is $7.50.

2352,"2013-03-27",3.9,"Bottle from trade with Phatdog1. Been interested in this because of such a high rating within a style that gets less respect than most. First surprise was the medium brown pour, which I was not expecting, and then a beautiful thick resilient and clingy head, followed up with a surprisingly intense VERY fresh hop aroma that puts many IPAs to shame. Flavor is definitely hop forward, which supports my view that the highest rated Ambers and Pales push into IPA territory to garner those ratings. Anyway, its a solid hop presence, and really the main attraction, although there are some carmel malt notes in there too. Reminds me of a Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale. Mouthfeel is substantial enough. The head lasts through the entire glass. I understand why its rated high; nice to have tried this one.

Great aroma of toffee, toasted nuts, coffee beans, and cocoa along with a big hop blast. The flavor is incredibly balanced and complex, almost exactly what you hope every amber ale will be. The dry bitter cocoa and roasted chestnut malt base yields to a citrusy and leafy hoppy finish. Maybe a bit too much bitterness on the finish considering its an amber ale and not an IPA, but thats nitpicking. This is phenomenal.

Aroma of intense hops is quite interesting with nice floral undertones. Taste is a great mix between intense hops presence with limited bitter notes and some really good citrus and earthy hops notes.

A bit of hop bite and a lack of astringency, which seems so prevalent in ambers, set this beer off.

This beautifully hoppy Amber Ale (or India Red Ale?) possesses muscular caramel and bread dough notes which are able to balance out the generous hop resins and their citrusy angles.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A creamy sheet of foam covers the cloudy russet.
-Aroma hops could be better defined. 
-Hops are quite coniferous throughout.
-Mouthfeel is full and comfortable.
-These guys brew great beer. I wish I could stock up on their fine wares...

2352,"2012-04-12",4.5,"Big thanks to my NorEaster buddy Eli for this bottle.  Enjoyed late at night alone with the super-good Journey soundtrack.

  Fine, fun, reserved label art.  Reminds me of Japanese penmanship - elegant use of white space.  The bottle opens with a snap, and gunsmoke, lots of it.  Excellent beginnings.

  A.  Looks like an Oud Bruin.  Deep russet, fall colors.  A medium, uneven burgundy-tinged head lingers.  Very little lace, spotty.  Quite clear. The head, incidentally, lasts for ever.  

  S.  In a word: grand.  Terrific balance here, malty and ""red"" for sure, but lots of caramel malt.  The comparisons to Nugget Nectar are inevitable.  The hops are both fruity and herbal in measure.  There is a soft, malt driven, polished sweetness and a perfume note (sandalwood?) that brings to mind the fine Hitachino brews out of the East.  Some beers try to shoehorn in a lot of ingredients and hope for this best, Zoe, by contrast, is simple, direct, and mojo filled.

  T.  Simply the finest Amber ale Ive had to date.  Zoe is a masterful, magic blend of semi-sweet malt sugar and balancing bitter, nuanced hop.  There is a tremendous depth to this beer, but like many such beers, its very hard to nail down.  Harmonious only begins to describe it.  The hop flavor - earthy, damp, bitter, dry, green - blends so well into the malt - sweet, fruity, complex, gently toasted, red - that they become one.  There are no steps or stages.  The finish is gently sweet and fades out, leaving a dry, bitter-green finish that is long and moreish. This is amazingly well brewed beer.  

  M / P.  Full, rounded carbonation exudes confidence.  Zoe is absolutely sessionable, despite the rather high 7.2% alcohol, which is nowhere to be found.

  Zoe is simply superb beer, a unique take on an little brewed style (in this case, Imperial Amber) and is such a self=assured, lush and harmonious beer that it deserves great praise.  This is what American craft brewing is all about.  I tip my hat to Maine brewing company.  Everyone should enjoy Zoe.","Columbia, South Carolina, USA","kkipple"

Pours a cloudy dark red amber with a two and a half finger beige head. Beautiful lacing. The aroma is a mixture of plum and black cherries, accented by grapefruit and citrus and a bit of grass and pine. Initially, the the flavor of dark fruit highlighted with grapefruit and citrus dominates transitioning to a bit of sweet malt and then finishes with piney hop bitterness. Considerable body supplied by a fairly hefty malt backbone for an American Amber/Red Ale, well carbonated and slick mouthfeel.

I normally carry my rate beer ap on my iphone to check beer ratings, but I left my iphone in the car and just decided to go for it.  I figured it was going to be either really good or really bad.  Pours a dark caramel brown with a tan creamy head.  Not really fond of amber ales this dark.  Things turned around when I took a whiff from the bottle.  Wow! a  pronounced fresh hop smell at the forefront. This beer deserves its high ratings - very hoppy but also well balanced, and very creamy. It is rare to find an amber ale that balances the roasty malt flavors with pronounced hops. The hops are more on the floral grassy side, with no bitterness whatsoever.

T - The beer starts off with some growing grapefruit and orange hop flavor and some mild bitterness alongside a bit of lightly roasted malt and a touch of brown sugar. Through the middle, some pine hop flavor comes through with more roasted flavors and a bit of coffee and chocolate.

2352,"2012-02-22",3.4,"A moderate beige foam forms atop the copper pour from which an attractive hop aroma emanates. The complex hop profile goes from coniferous needles to straight resin passing through orange blossom and red grapefruit along the way. Underneath, the darkish malt profile brings about caramelized notions to be sure, but intermingling with earthy chocolate undertones. Actually pretty attractive there as well. Im not sure this hop profile has enough light time under the massive hop strain, quickly being eaten up by the bitterness that dominates the slight roast and amps up the acidity. Nevertheless, this has quality and freshness written all over it and I can see many people falling in love with that one. Myself, I just prefer it a bit more straightforward like their Peeper.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed fresh a few days after purchase
The look: Cloudy dark red body topped by a small beige head
In long: The very aromatic nose would feel uber-hoppy by IPA standard, so the fact that this is classified a an amber ale is ridiculous.  A ton of coniferous and grassy hops over a toasted caramelized malts.  Taste is heavily malted, a lot of toasted caramelized malts and then some more.  Also some toasted nuts.  Then comes a truckload of hops, very coniferous, bitter grapefruits, freshly cut grass.  Bitterness level is medium-high.  This is almost like some kind of Bigfoot-Light.

Pine, grass, earth, citrus and a waft of malt sweetness rise from the tulip glass. Flavor follows the aroma but not as strong.  The mouthfeel is where I was surprised. Very easy drinking and medium bodied ( bordering on light to medium bodied).  There is a lingering pleasant bitterness and dryness that begs for another sip.  I could easily quaff these all night.  A stronger hop flavor would make this beer world class.","Pennsylvania, USA","McGrupp612"

Aroma is superb, with great notes of grassy and piney hop and really good malt balance, including nut and caramel. Flavor isnt quite as good, but still quite tasty, with additional citrus hop presence that remains very balanced. Medium bodied mouthfeel, good bitterness at the finish. In the same vein as Troegs Nugget Nectar, but with differences, and not quite as well done. Still, really nice effort from such a small brewery.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
2352,"2011-05-27",3.8,"Bottle/25oz - Thanks to MCox90 for this one.  Pours a quite dark brown with a small, but creamy head that settled to a very viscous covering over the beer and which left a nice amount of lacing on the glass.  Aroma is nicely hoppy with plenty of grassiness, pineiness and citrus to satisfy most any hop head.  Flavor is also quite hoppy and also quite bitter, which I liked a lot.  Although hoppy/bitter, this beer also has a roasted malt understructure that balances this beer very nicely.  Some alcohol burn on the finish, which was lingering and bitter , but it did not detract from the overall experience.  Very nice...","Seymour, Tennessee, USA","VTHopHead"

A: Wow. Power waft of hops upon first crack of bottle and the glass proved just as impressive. This smells fucking delicious. Smooth bold hops smell liike sweet, sugary, candied spruce, pineapple, orange and lemon - all of this riding high atop a beautiful caramel maltiness. Superb. Damn this nice.

A: Pours a rich dark brown with reddish hue (dark sienna) with huge, dense, 3 finger seafoam colored head. I grew impatient as I waited for this thing to lay down. Sticky lace paints the sides of the glass as if it was sponged on.

T: Happy things going on here: A healthy, borderline IPA, dose of piney evergreen-like hops complemented by a solid caramel and nutty backbone of malt goodness with a orange/grapefruit sweetness reappearing mid sip and riding thru the finish.

P: Medium, super creamy, nice slighty sweet and bitter finish. End of one sip is an almost perfect seque into the next.

O: Sleek bottle, clean simple label, and every aspect of the the beer itself is spot on tight. These guys only have 2 brews and both are simply fantastic. Highly recommended, this is superb drinking. Ill buy one each time I see it.

Taste is mildly caramel and a little sweet. Think of bready malt mixed with citrus, orange rind and tangerines. Hints of chocolate and citrus in a long lingering but fairly dry finish. Medium to light body is maybe the only thing I could suggest to improve this one. I would have loved a touch more body. Smooth resinous and candy like sweet mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation.

Pours a nice reddish-amber color with a good off-white head and some nice lacing. The nose is really quite nice with a really strong presence of citrus and pine hops as well as some light amber malt. The taste is a bit of light malt with a good level of bitterness, though not as much as the nose would have indicated. This drinks really well and is a beautiful Red IPA (lets get that new style rolling...) and Id love to try a few more things from Maine Brewing.

Pours a nice, deep clear copper with a crazy thick head that leaves some of the most impressive lacing Ive ever seen.  A full two inch cap sticks on top for the duration.  I honestly cant think of a better looking amber.

Aroma is bright with floral hops and light lemon and pineapple citrus.  There is still a noticeable caramel malt presence but the hops are the star in the nose.

Taste is almost as impressive with the toasted caramel malts taking the forefront a little more.  That said the floral pine and grassy hops are still a major player and leave a bitter, dry finish.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and exceptionally smooth for the style.  Sticky with hops but with a dry, slightly roasted character on the palate.

Probably not quite in Nugget Nectar territory, but this is a great amber - hop forward with the right balance of malts and body.  Well done.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

2352,"2010-08-19",3.8,"Serving:  500 ml bottle from Vintage House. 
Aroma: The nose is definitely hoppy and reminds me of a Sierra Nevada product.  Green, piney hops with a nice malt underbelly.  A touch of bread and caramel. 
Appearance: It pours a very dark amber color with a large, well sustained light tan head.  A nice cloud of foam there.  
Taste: Potently bitter with those piney, resinous hops going to work on you.  The malt is there in good proportion, just not enough to take the lead.  Earthy with some dark bread notes, but otherwise clean. 
Palate: I will say it has a medium body, but it starts off feeling almost rich but then finishes light and dry.  A nice lingering bitterness too.  Lots of soft carbonation.

Aroma is incredibly fresh with tons of hops- very citrusy and resinous, tons of pine, some dank weed, mostly big columbus (fresh legit stuff with no garlic), and a decent caramel malt backbone hints of nutty soft sweet chocolate- tootsie roll as well.   As the beer warms there is a crazy fresh hop and coffee clash that is kind of amazing! Flavor is a good balance (not harsh malts clashing with hops) with hops somewhat dominating, but malt is soft nutty chocolate with a soft fresh either green coffee bean or some very light roasted bean- but most of the flavor is resinous pine sap and green citrusy hops- orange and grapefruit oils.  Very soft clean finish with a moderate bitterness.  Damn- I didnt even look to see if this was going to be good when I bought it, but I am very surprised.  I love this stuff.  Maine needs more brewers like this new Maine Beer Company (and Marshall Wharf).  Great stuff!
