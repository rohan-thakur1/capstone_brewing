Very pale yellow, only a few shades darker than clear, with a distinct pink tinge on the edges; fizzy and enormous, explosive white head (so tread carefully) from overabundant carbonation. Taste is lightly tart, lightly bitter, very sugary (leaves sugar on the teeth!), with black pepper and some esters, and a little alcohol heat. Sharp but faint caramel, lots of fruit, lightly chalky with vanilla, fullish (too full) body.

Flavour is fruity, something the nose didnt give off, with notes of banana, lemon and green apples, which is then overtaken by the prominent notes of hay, freshly baked bread and loads of cereal malt. Rather flavourful for being a 5% blond, a style that is usually bland and generic. Dry and soft mouthfeel, with a wonderful amount of fruitiness that makes this very refreshing.

2102,"2012-04-18",3.5,"""333"" from The Davis Beer Shoppe. Pours rather dishwater gold with a white head. Aroma of mild - both bread and probably saaz. Med body. Flavor is something of a fruity pils. Not strongly fruity - but its there. Lightly bready and rather herbal hop. Its bitter enough to push into a decent pils range, but this is an ale. Perhaps this is what happens with pils ingredients and an ale yeast. Might account for the fruit hint. Main attraction is the bitter finish - also it could pass for a clean beer.

2102,"2012-04-15",3.8,"12 ounce bottle from The Davis Beer Shoppe.  $6...yikes!  The aroma on this is very nice with some subtle biscuit and doughy malts present.  A light honey aroma is also present.  Hazy, cloudy, unfiltered straw-colored body with a medium, strong fluffy white head present.  Good lacing.  Blondes should be filtered, no?  Starts with a, earthy hop bitterness, which is fairly aggressive.  This is followed by some light, cereal maltiness, which tastes a lot like pilsner malt.  Finishes crisp, dry, and even more earthy with a significant hop kick. There is a very nice, creamy, perfect carbonated body on this.  An enjoyable beer for summer, but at 50 cents an ounce, I cant really justify buying this beer again.  I have a feeling this beer will sit on the shelves for awhile, and that stale product will not be a good thing...especially with a hoppy beer like this.

2102,"2008-04-02",3.5,"500 mL, hand-labelled bottle from the brewery via Lubiere (merci!), served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass.
App.:  Medium golden, clear (but large flecks of yeast in the bottle...), fairly decent white meringue.
  
Aroma:  A nice blend of fruitiness, cereals and hops; cherries, berries, peaches, peppery, light treacle, a very hard to describe green smell, melons, a touch of floral honey, non-descript spices.
  
Palate:  Medium body and kinda soft carbonation that gives a soft overall impression.
  
Flav.:  Peppery-spicy-lemony-fruity; some cereals, a bit off-dry, solid bitterness; leaves a bit of alcohol behind.  Reminds me of a Saison quite a bit.

2102,"2007-01-23",4.7,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2007 Now hear about this lovely and rocking little novelty. It is a cloudy golden ale topped by an honest sheet of white foam. Appealing and growing on you nose takes one aback by its rather estery fruity notions that march beside the skillful extraction which allows such clean and pure graininess, crunchy fresh cereals from the most humble and yet apt basic pale malts. Natural  and engaging carbonation and its sibling yeastiness impart an invigorating texture which deploys its charms down to the bottom of the throat. Crisp noble hops appear more and more vigorous by the sip, grassy, leafy, yet more into bittering and balancing purposes than aromas. Now thats a pleasant and unexpected surprise. An absolutely gorgeous little session ale, basically what could be made into a futuristic Saison if we ever come back to the hardcore farming. This is feeding by its mere texture, light in alcohol, hugely drinkable and charmingly flavorful, screaming its love for the ingredients it originated from while letting the drinker know of the masterful hands which are behind their integration.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

In short: 
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed fresh.  MUST BE consumed fresh.
The look: Cloudy banana yellow body topped by a persistent medium white head
In long: Nose of fresh cereals and freshly cut grass.  Theres a ton of cereals in this baby, oh man, how were they able to fit so much cereals in a beer that end-up feeling so soft?  Big fresh hay character.  Fruity flavours of lemon, bananas, pineapples, a little green apples touch.  A lot of grassy hops with a character that differs from the usual Saaz-ish dry grassiness.  This is like soft freshly cut grass, hard to describe.  Overall sensation of meringue.  Body is as full as I can hope for the this type of beer and the carbonation is appropriately average.  Finish is dry and rather tart that makes it exceptionally refreshing.  Fantastic brew, and to think that this is Hopfenstark entry-level blonde beer.

2102,"2007-01-18",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 16, 2011 Any first impressions?
-A frothy head dissipates into the hazy pale straw.
-Well-developed cereals proudly reach the nostrils as subdued hoppiness do not announce the potency of their presence in the flavor profile.
-Soaring noble, herbal hops carry into a leafy bitterness, gravitating around the purported chewy cereals.
-The ample yet drinkable maltiness and soft, big-bubbled effervescence emulates Franconian/Bavarian unfiltered lagers.

What if you dig deeper?
-Honeyed bananas discreetly approach the spicy, herbal hoppiness.
-I am reminded of Drei Kronen Schesslitzs Lagerbier. Very impressive!!
-Immensely drinkable yet never frail, this competently-brewed German countryside classic (as an ale, in this case) cannot fail to please. An amazing beginning for this new microbrewer. THIS is a golden ale!
