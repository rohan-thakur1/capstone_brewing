2626,"2016-02-21",3.4,"Bottle thanks to brewer.
Appearance - golden with a decent head. It disappears fast. 
Nose - lemon and malt.
Taste - more of the same. A bit like a Kolsch but some banana coming through.
Palate - close to medium bodied with a creamy texture and a long dry finish.
Overall - it is a decent beer but not necessarily as creamy as Id hoped for from the style.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"
2626,"2016-02-10",2.8,"Bottle at Craigs, thanks to Keiths only homer  BenH. It pours clear pissy gold with a medium white head. The nose is rather mellow, white bread, cracker, cereal and dull sweet banana. The taste is soft, mellow banana, straw, wheaten bread, hay, apple and soft fruits with a smooth finish. Medium body and average carbonation. Cant say filtered wheat beer is my favourite style, but there is nothing wrong with this juan. Okay.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
