In taste there are some dark fruity notes, dark bread, burnt sugar, its more sweet and less sour than in the aroma, but there is this strong tart note that makes it akin to wine and sour beers.

More roasted malt, more tar and heavy sweetness, but as the beer opens up, it begins to distinguish itself and a little yeasty sourness takes it away from the stout, adding notes of vanilla and other spizes.

Vierte en color castaño oscuro ligeramente turbio. Espuma ligeramente tintada, escasa y bastante fugaz, Sin apenas adherencia. Porque carbonatación. 
Indudablemente intensa nariz, con fuertes notas de ciruela pasa. Bastante licorosa en nariz y con un punto de pegamento. Complejidad media. 
Centros sabores destaca el dulce, con una primera entrada en boca francamente sorprendente. Y aparece también un punto de acidez muy suave que equilibra muy bien el dulce. 
Con la evolución en boca aparece un amargor muy tenue, y a pesar de ser el dulce el sabor principal, el final en boca no resulta en la absoluto empalagoso. Más bien al contrario. La sensación de estar tomando algo parecido a un licor de frutas es notable. 
Peso medio en boca y textura casi aterciopelada. A pesar de ser una cerveza licorosa, no se sienten en absoluto los 10° de alcohol que tiene. En este sentido está muy bien equilibrada. Persistencia en boca baja. 
Una cerveza agradable para tomar como copa, aunque poco apta si lo que buscas es una cerveza refrescante. Hay que saber lo que se está tomando antes de abrir una Pannepot Vintage.

There is a good maltiness up front that produces bits of sweet toffee and light chocolate. The figs hold their own and offer a strong darkness to it. The grapes fade from bright and fruity to more of a dark and dry wine addition. Its complex and good. The mouth feel is a little light and the carbonation is well done.

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. Just like every good Belgian beer, it is so hard to say anything else here. The beer could have had a better head however. Had a old one that was not very balanced, but just had a fresh one and it definitely had some roasted malts to balance that sweetness.

Looks: Brownish black colour with a thin layer of dark yeast sediments; One-quarter finger head and beige foam which fades in 40 seconds. Good sticky lacing with near zero carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant rich dark malt, with potent alcohol, faint Cognac, raisins, caramel, toffee, coffee, cream, soy sauce, brown sugar, strong Bel yeast, biscuits and faint grass.

Taste: Strong sweet full malt, with strong alcohol, rich cream, burnt toast, cherries, plum, raisins, caramel, sweet toffee, strong spices, strong Bel yeast, lime cordial, moderate bitter hops and light grass.

Body: Full body. Thick and very creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: The first thing that hits you is the strong sweet booze reminiscent of Chimay Blue, only stronger and nicer! Very rich dark malt base, very creamy and smooth. It has strong Stout elements here with lingering burnt toast, coffee, cream, soy sauce (as the beer warms) yet the ester fruitness and spicyness of cherry and dark fruits shine just as brightly. This is just a very recent brew and I have already hit the jackpot!

Hoppiness: Faint grass in nose. Lime cordial and grass in taste. Bitterness is mostly from malts burnt toast but complements well with moderate hop astringency for an abrupt, vary sweet-malty finish. 

After Taste: Slightly dry. Very creamy, very fruity and sweet boozy to mouth.

Comments: My bottle might had been leaky so theres not much head nor carbo to speak of, but the aroma and taste are intense on all front - malty, creamy, toasty, fruity, stouty, spicy, and tasty sweet strong booze.

Scents of cinnamon, plum, pear, caramel, salted chocolate, pretzel, red grape, and Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon (hearty, fruity, dark red wine). Quite spicy in aroma. The smell reminds me of a freshly baked Snickerdoodle cookie. Great, complex, appetizing aroma. Pours a maroon-ish dark brown or a very dark amber with a small amount of taupe head. Amber glow. Nice color. Much suspended particulate. The flavor largely matches the aroma except that the flavor is a bit more bitter than the aroma is. Gingerbread, molasses, chocolate, bitters (Angostura or otherwise), and prune flavors. Tangy, dry, complex, and delicious. A touch of booze noticeable, but in a totally inoffensive way. Prune-like aftertaste. Medium to full body. Not as thick in the palate as I thought it would be. Fizzy, lively, and smooth. Easy to drink given the high alcohol. Pannepot is really, really good.

Very intense, sweetish fruity-malty taste of prunes, figs and raisins, accompanied by flavours of cane sugar, dark chocolate and a bit of coffee. Rather long, chocolaty, slightly warming and even a bit hoppy finish. Full body, creamy and smooth mouthfeel, very soft carbonation. Great beer.

no head retention is visible in this dark brown to black ale. The slight rim of lacing present is a light tan color. the aroma is big and chewy with big sweet fig notes. a subtle fall spice character shows itself and seems to play nicely with the sweet maple/chocolate oatmeal aromatics. Med/high mouthfeel, real smooth, low/medium carbonation. the alcohol hides so well in this beer i am not sure if its because of the big chewy malty flavors or something different. i am really loving the fig/raisin quality that this beer has i believe the spiciness is plays nicely with the chocolate tones and rounds the whole thing out. It is a good thing this stuff is not readily available because its way to drinkable. solid beer i am glad i waited to crack this bad boy open.","Pennsylvania, USA","orvalgold"

2858,"2015-01-09",4.0,"Intriguing quad, although honesty didnt blow me away as much as my favorites. Appearance is a dark molasses- very pretty brown lacing with small carbonation bubbles. Aroma and taste are for me dominated by candied fruits with very mild bread undertones. A slight alcohol burn on the palate that disipitates rapidly when you swallow into a dry slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall clearly a complex and well crafted beer deserving of high marks, but def not the best in my book. I prefer rochefort, westvleteren, or even chimay blue.","","Cluniac"

De smaak is fantastisch, heel complexe en speciale smaken in dit bijzondere bier.
Tonen van geroosterde malt, karamel, gedroogd fruit als rozijnen, dadels. Verder ook koffie en chocolade, winter specerijen als kaneel en kruidnagel en aardachtige smaak. Het mondgevoel is zacht, bijna romig met weinig koolzuur. De afdronk is lang en zacht met houtige tonen en licht bittere hop finish. Dit bier is zo complex en zacht, dat je moet zoeken om een beter Belgisch bier te vinden. Naar mijn idee zelfs nog iets beter dan toppers als Rochefort 10, Westvleteren 12 en St. Bernardus abt. 12. De smaak van dit brouwsel is nog iets specialer, door de stout bier tonen. Maakt ook nieuwsgierig naar de Pannepot 2013, Reserva 2010, en Grand Reserva 2009 die ik nog heb liggen.

2858,"2014-12-27",3.4,"2012 version.

Completely black in color, with a one finger broad, beige, froth head.

Smells of spiced, sweet milk chocolate with a caramel core to it, while also providing a flowery, peppery pull. On top of that settles a hint of hot glue, together with molasses, balanced by earthy, calming malts.

Begins with earthy cocoa nibs, cream and toffee. The smooth mouthfeel experiences an addition of bubbly carbonation, which adds to the sweeter toffee presence. Spices become visible in a slightly peppery and licorice fashion, while also compliementing to the sweetness. The balance remains, because of earthy malts, along with hazelnuts and a Coca-Cola note. Finishes with a gentle coffee note, which isnt bitter at all, due to the more present cane sugar and nougat, accompanied by a tingly spiciness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

2858,"2014-11-03",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2016 Tasting this very complex beer is an amazing experience. At first fruity and spicy esters, then a massive doppelbock caramel aroma soon followed by christmas cake, mature fruit, nuts, then chocolate, and at last bitter coffee. The aftertaste is incredibly clean and not so persisting. The body is lighter than youd expect. Every sip is different from the following one that I think Id need at least 3 bottles to really understand this elegant beer and how it plays with its balance between maltiness and ""esterness"". Hops actually not perceived neither spices added. Very dark color with a medium foam. The alcohol content is just something printed on the label. 

Update: after more than two years Im tasting this beer again, a 2015 bottle. Sure there are esters (prune and yellow fruit above all) but the phenols are less preminent than the previous one. Im astonished by the fabulous chewiness and the massive velvety texture. Its very next to an imperial stout, less belgian than I recalled. Im changing some marks because this beer is a freaking awesome.

P.S. For the beer geeks like me: the FG (measured) is 1030 although they say its 1025.

Nice stuff from De Struise here, the beer was exceptionally sweet throughout with quite a complex mix of dark & ripe fruits that seems to mask some of the alcohol.

2858,"2014-09-14",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2015 The ""Fishermans Ale"". Not Struises first, but the beer with which they first attracted international attention; I remember the first batch, brewed at Caulier (and tasted at Kulminator years ago), as being a perfectly decent massieve ale, but a lot sweeter and more straightforward; the recipe was revised then and the result became one of the most wonderfully complex and rich, profound brews in Belgium.  It has a very dark bronze colour, hazy, with a thickly lacing, light beige, creamy head; very fruity and deeply malty profile, candi sugar, complex with pleasant drying spicy notes, elegant yeastiness and characterful hop bitterishness in the finish along with warming, liqueurish alcohol. Hints of port, banana, walnuts, candied orange, toast, bitter chocolate, caramel...  Very complex, balanced and solid, a great beer indeed.  The 2014 issue seems to have become notably more tart, with a drying sour berry acidity almost as in a Flemish sour; in comparison, the earlier vintages (2013 and before) are more rounded and sweet, acting more like genuine abts, with more pronounced hints of port, banana and candi sugar.  I tasted several vintages yesterday: the 2011 was a lot like the 2013 but with a somewhat less pronounced aroma and more restrained flavour, but very well balanced.  The 2009 in comparison showed signs of maderization, effectively making it more complex and more noble.  The 2008 was expectedly further oxidized and a bit thinned by age, leading to the conclusion that quality (slowly) begins to deteriorate a bit after six odd years, though it still remained a great beer of wonderful complexity...  Clearly a great beer for ageing, which holds strong for quite a number of years.  Highly recommended!","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2858,"2014-08-08",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 8, 2014 Pannepot 2010 - Sűrű testű, nem túl hivalkodó habbal bír, illata pedig hasonlóképpen visszafogott, finoman sejtető. Az élesztőfelhők közé egy légiesen könnyed gyümölcsösség, enyhe lekváros árnyalat fonódik - a gyümölcsök természetesen a markánsabb fajtából valók -, az aroma összességében azonban meglehetősen lágy, a legkevésbé sem zömök, vagy átütő. Kakaó, kávé és étcsokoládé finomítja tovább a képet, melyek ez esetben valóban a világosabb tónusok mentén tartják meg az aromaskálát, nem nehezítik el a hangulatot. A lezárás ezt követően szintén az élesztő savanykás élű képében jelentkezik. Azt semmi esetre sem állíthatjuk, hogy a képzeletbeli édesség-fokmérő maximum értéket mutatna a tesztelés során, a kandiscukorral viszont ez esetben sem spóroltak a főzőmesterek. Közel sem annyira émelyítő és nehéz azonban, mint néhány korábban kóstolt darab - csakúgy, mint az illata esetében, az édes zamatok ezúttal is remekül nyújtják szét a terepet, nem tódulnak egybe, finoman terjednek szét egy harmonikus keretet adva az ízeknek. Ezek között leginkább a diós, mazsolás jellegű, desszertszerű komponenseké a főszerep, melyekhez egy fűszeres, gyógynövényes jelleg is társul, a komló kissé távolinak tűnő karaktere és egy enyhébb fokú alkoholos érintettség mellett. Ami számomra a leginkább különlegessé teszi ezt a sört klasszikusan finom ízén kívül, az a tökéletesen egyedi test, mely a felsorolt benyomások, cukrászati alapanyagok emlékképének jelenléte ellenére határozottan éles tud maradni, és egy üvegvékony gerincként bár, de mindvégig ellen képes állni a hízott összetevők mázsás súlyának. Lényegében tehát némileg könnyedebb ital képe bontakozott ki a kóstolása során, mint amire előzetesen számítani lehetett, a hatás azonban feltétlenül pozitív volt. Különlegesen gazdag főzet.
Pannepot 2012 - A Pannepeut-tal némiképp összehasonlítva a színében egy sötétebb, majdhogynem feketés árnyalatot vesz fel, habja is nagyobb, ám ugyanolyan telt és krémes, mint az említett típusé. Az első meglepetés az aromái terén ér, mivel azok megérzésem szerint a savanykásabb, vadóc élesztős hangulat hiteles közvetítői. Eperlekváros, gyümölcsaszalványos, s egyszerre éretlen gyümölcsös jegyek szabadulnak fel, a fanyarság nagyobb foka véleményem szerint az utolsó cseppig kitöltött élesztő jelenlétének, na meg a kornak tudható be. Íze is a fanyar irány felé halad, sós és édes, savanykás és óvatosan kesernyés jellemvonásokat egyaránt felvonultat, szilvalekvár, mazsola, némi karamell és marcipán, dohány képe is feltűnik, rendkívül színes tehát a forgatag, összességében azonban az érett, nem metszően, inkább lágyan fanyar, harsány élesztős karakter a fő mondanivalója ennek a példánynak, s a vibráló kavalkád mintegy tartalommal tölti meg a vaskos kontúrokat. Bebizonyosodott tehát, hogy a korábban kóstolt verziótól az évjáratbeli különbségek igen erőteljesen elválasztják az egyes változatokat, bár nem kevésbé fantasztikus, mindenképpen más főzetet csodálhatunk tehát ennek a típusnak a személyében.","HUNGARY","adster"

2858,"2014-07-12",4.2,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a super hazy dark brown-mahogany color with a billowy off white head. The head fades rather slowly over time to leave a good level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is quite heavy of darker fruit smells with lots of plum, raisin, and fig. Along with the darker fruit smells comes plenty of bready and lightly roasted malt smells. Some yeasty smells as well as some other sweet aromas of a caramel and toffee nature come along as well. A bit of spice of coriander and clove as well as a slightly funky like smell come and linger on the nose creating a rather dark and sweet but slightly funky off aroma to sit on the nose.
 Taste  The taste begins with a very dark fruit sweet flavor with tons of raisin, fig, plum, and cherry. The sweeter flavors are matched by a bit of a bready and doughy taste with a hint of a chocolate and a bit of roasted malt mixed within. The yeast and spice that were detected in the nose come on more strongly toward the middle of the taste and bring a very nice dimension to the brew, complementing well the sweeter dark fruit flavors of the brew nicely. Some candied sugar flavors and a little bit of a rummy booziness develop on the tongue as the flavors advances, bringing a little bit of warmth to the taste. At the very end, a little bit of earth and a light woody/oaky flavor join the profile which end up leaving a very tasty and somewhat smoother, but robust sweet dark fruit quad flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average side in terms of thickness and creaminess for a brew of 10 % abv. with a carbonation level that is on the average side as well. The average thickness and carbonation are a nice compromise for the sweeter dark fruit and boozy, oaky, and spiced flavors of the brew and makes for a nice easy drinking, yet slower sipping brew overall.
 Overall  This is one quite tasty quad. This one is on the tops of my list. Dark fruity, nicely spiced, and yeasted, with a good blend of a warming taste/feel, but all while maintaining a great drinkability and enjoyability. This is quite a nice quad!!","","Darkmagus82"

Color is very dark with a head that doesnt last very long. Upon the first taste, the great complexity of this beer surfaces: cherry, raisin, dark chocolate, some coffee. The sweetness gets the upper hand, yet there is plenty of bitterness balancing this nicely. The body is very full with a slick texture and a long finish.

Aroma - has dark fruit (figs, black cherry), caramelized sugar and alcohol, 
Appearance - the body is taupe in color, the liquid opaque, the head sadly not present save a tiny buff colored ring. Albeit there is no head to speak of it still has a beautiful glow about it.
Taste - the taste is excellently conceived - sweetness is the primary element with dark fruit (most notably fig, raisin, and black cherry), there is also alcohol, but its wave is held back - letting you enjoy the components of this really delightful brew. Incredibly complex and very subtle, its really enjoyable.
Palate - body is full, the texture almost chewy, slick, and thick. The carbonation is soft on the surface, average on the palate. The finish is medium in length with the soothing qualities of alcohol around the gums. Great feel. Warming as well

That is a really great beer. Sometimes, a highly praised beer hits all the marks, but isnt really that enjoyable - they can be a challenge. This beer has high billing and brings the goods.

Appearance: The body is clear with a deep chestnut to garnet hue, opaque through the center with a short tan head that dissipates into a foamy ring with a sparse coating.
Aroma: The aroma is restrained, but has brown sugar, cherry and fig notes with a slight medicinal presence.
Taste: Fruity right away with a grape flavor that transforms into fig then into green apple before finishing as grape. Malts are very weak with caramel and hints of brown sugar while a medicinal flavor finishes out the beer matching the grape on the finish. Odd.
Palate: Like a watery syrup, think Robotussin instead of Nyquil, with mild carbonation.

I have to admit I would have not considered buying without this insight.  Pannepot is a nice treat!  Aromas of raisin and caramel--even rum cake in there; flavors follow in much the same way.  I was worried the 2011 vintage may be too old, but I had no problems and I noticed other rate-a-tarians rating the same vintage.

2858,"2013-03-15",4.1,"Rating #800. 2011 vintage tasted alongside 2009 Pannepot Reserva and 2011 Pannepeut. 33 cL bottle from Binnys Beverage Depot in Chicago, served in a stem glass. Pours hazy chestnut with a tiny tan head that fades to a few bubbles. The nose has huge toasted malts and chocolate up front, along with figs, dark fruit, cherries, caramel, earth and just a touch of hops. The flavour is moderately sweet throughout with a subtle spiciness and rich fruity notes. Chocolate, roast malts and oak enter through the middle and longer towards the end. The finish is long and sweet with toasted malts and fruit. On the palate it is medium-full in body with a smooth, milky texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a great chocolatey malty spicy strong ale. Very complex and elegant. 2013-03-14","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

Updated: so I sat on another 2007 bottle of this for 9 or so months, not a ton of time per say but for a beer this old it can change in a hurry. Aroma - similar but much more sherry like, smells a lot like a barley wine. Taste - its mellowed a lot in fact I think the first bottle I had was the infected version as there is no wine aftertaste, and the bottle didnt fizz all over the place like last time. In this bottle I get rich butterscotch, raisins, brown sugar and man it is oh so smooth, no hint of the booze...absolutely zero..no idea what this tastes like fresh but good grief for a beer 5 or so years old it has held up remarkably well. I docked it on the appearance last time as it fizzed everywhere and was a glass of foam until it chilled out. Bumping it up there 
as it poured great this time.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","kbudd19"

Aroma: malty, spices, maybe a trace of cherry.

Appearance: Pours around upper end on SRM scale, 40. Dark opaque. Average carbonation.  Caramel mocha head settles to thick-ish ring and slick.

Taste: Malty sweetness balanced quite well with spices. Sweetness and spices and fruity notes giving way to a bit more tang and tart on the back end (relatively).  Somewhat boozy. Complex and tasty.   I love Belgian Strong Ales, as well as quads (as this is categorized at BA).  Put some sweetness and spices into this pot and add some clear craftsmanship and Im happy.  My only bottle of this, Ill certainly grab more next time I see it.

The aroma is much more fresh and hot than the others though not off putting at all. The yeast and malt are of fresh brown bread and caramel. Theres no oxidation. The fruits are just ripe, both orchard and ripe bananas. The flavor is mostly sweet but not cloying, restrained alcohol heat and spice in the foreground, and with fruits and baking spices riding through.  The mouthfeel is incredibly full, creamy, and lively.  I feel like I should love the older reservas more but this is just so comforting on top of being only slightly less rich.

Slight, but not uncomfortable metallic taste at first that very soon gives way to toffee, brown sugar, raisins and hints of vanilla and coffee. Very nice creamy mouthfeel with a lingering, slightly boozy finish. Very good. Have three more that I think will age quite well if cellared right.

Aroma: caramel, alcohol, pretty clean otherwise.

Taste: medium sweetness, not bitter - absolutely, caramel, some low heat.
Palate: I was a bit surprised that the carbonation, which is fairly high, didnt make more of tingle. A bit of alcohol heat but not unpleasant.
Overall: I do like this beer. The flavors I find are absolutely something in my taste but they could also be more pronounced. I may have to let it warm up a bit more.

Beautiful, substantive tan head and a little lacing. Sweet, seductive aromatics: figs, prunes, toffee, a suggestion of guava, caramel, black cherries. Awesome! The alcohol does prickle inside the nostrils, but the sweet bouquet of fruity esters and sweet malts is irresistible. On the tongue, its equally delicious, if less alcoholic. It starts out sweet, toys with the tart for a bit, and has a somewhat dry finish, evoking something like sweet limetta peel (or some other sweet citrus peel anyway).

2858,"2012-11-25",4.3,"2011 vintage bottle poured into my Rockmill chalice. Pours a darker brown with some cloudiness. Theres a light khaki colored head of foam that dissipates to just a ring around the edges of the glass with some small clouds floating in the middle of the beer. Decent lacing. In the aroma I get some fig, raisin, cinnamon, chocolate, toffee, nutmeg. The beer opens up as it warms. Alcohol was quite noticeable while it was cold, but it blends in as the temperature rises. Upon the first sip, I get a rich coffee taste along with some alcohol, but that gives way to a wave of chocolate covered cherries, raisins, and fig newtons. The spiced notes from the aroma seem to have attached themselves to the fruity, chocolatey, coffee-y taste. Theres so much going on in this beer. It is truly a fantastic experience.

Schwarzes Bier mit wenig, braunem Schaum. Schönes malzwürziges Bouquet mit deutlicher Kaffeenote. Im Antrunk sehr spritig. Der Geschmack findet eigentlich nicht statt, geradezu ein Geschmacksloch! Vom alkoholdominanten Antrunk geht dieses Bier gleich über in einen langen Abgang nach Lakritze und Holz. Die Malzwürze und der Kaffee aus dem Aroma finden sich im Geschmack leider überhaupt nicht wieder. Die Flasche mit dem Segelboot ist hübsch. Die Aufschrift ""Old Fishermans Ale"" lässt an Fishermans Friend denken ""Sind sie zu stark, bist du zu schwach!"" Allerdings liegt das schlechte Abschneiden des Pannepot (Jahrgang 2009) ja nicht nur am (zu) hohen Alk.-Gehalt. Dieses Bier ist für mich schlichtweg zu grobschlächtig und unausgewogen.

Dark fruit and toffee sweetness are most pronounced, but very smooth, balanced, and rounded. Of the three enjoyed side-by-side, this received the lowest score - not because it is bad, but because I enjoyed the complexity of the other versions more.

Delicious sweet flavors and a spicy touch. Medium roastiness in the finish. Notes of latte, chocolate, cane sugar, vanilla and Irish Whisky Cream. Wonderful and highly drinkable.

Aroma is dark dried fruits (raisins, dates, prunes) a whiff of sea salt, big oak character, a syrupy sweetness like a dark fruit jam or something. Flavor follows with a fairly full mouthfeel and flavors of fruit, not quite sticky but syrupy certainly. If I poured it over vanilla ice cream I imagine it would be a phenomenal experience. Flavors add spiciness, peppery, but around that chocolate blackberry or plum first noticed in the nose.  Belgian yeast and candy sugars come in a dark molasses kind of way.

The pour is a very dark brown with a gargantuan tan head that has the appearance of whipped meringue. A nice sheet of lacing is left, coating the glass pretty well. Aromas consist of dark fruits, Belgian yeast, various spices, subtle cherries, and alcohol. This beer is quite tasty, and certainly a good example of a quad.

This ones been aging six years now, and I thought it would grand time to revisit it, along with the Grand Reserva version. 

Pours a dark marroon red. Within the highlights one sees a certain clarity to the beer, unlike Westvleterens typical chunkiness. The frothy off-white head dissipated quickly leaving behind a soft stream of bubbles that trail to the rim of the glass.

The smell is vivid, deep but with bright notes of cherries and pipe tobacco. Dark malty undertones of bitter unsweetened chocolate and coffee beans softened with creamy vanilla. Finds itself more aligned with St. Bernardus in the nose, although even brighter perhaps. As the beer warms up, plum, caramel and some wispy alcoholic tones appear. 

The first sip is unctuous, thick, rich with smoky tobacco flavors that roll onto the tongue in a wave of syrupy sweetness. The slight carbonation tingles as a burst of cherry and caramel develops. Smoothly the Pannepot transitions off the palate and into a long and powerful finish. 

Pannepot is one of those few beers that manages to balance amazing complexity with a punchy distinctive flavor that doesnt lose its focus. Its the difference between a symphony and a cacophony. I think of this brew as a true counterpart to our favorite trappists. I wouldnt call myself a believer, but the Pannepot truly invokes a spiritual feeling.

My biggest thanks to Urbain and Carlos for an incredible experience.

Updated September 7, 2016. Ten year anniversary of my batch of Pannepot from my first trip to Struise. 

Pours a dark purplish black with a lively, frothy, lacy cream head. Smells divine. Loads of overripe prunes soaked in brandy, or maybe port? Rich and balanced. Chocolate, blackberries, black currants, rounded by a small amount of oaky vanilla. A hint of licorice. Thick molasses, dark fruits, and a wisp of smokiness coming from the roasted mocha-flavored malts. The carbonation is subtle but present, adding the perfect tingly fluffy texture to this truly magnificent brew. Im simply floored by how this beer has aged, I give it the exact same marks as 5 years ago. I have a batch of 2006 from the neighboring monks at Westvleteren that hasnt done nearly as well!","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Incredible nose, somehow both resinous and citrus, red fruit, vanilla, strawberry, blackcurrant - fruity, in other words, but amazingly wide-ranging - with a hint of chocolate, proper black forest gateau, and a touch of roast. Amazing. 

Anyway, deep breath, new paragraph. Flavours: black forest gateau is to the fore here, really noticeable combination of the jammy and the chocolatey. Theres a good deal of plumminess but its all about that spicy characteristic, almost like very high quality chili chocolate. If I have one, worthlessly churlish criticism, its that its a touch steely up front, probably due to the youth of it. Overall, totally, gorgeous.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","Jacob23_5"

Difficult to detect any hop resins in the aftertaste as the dark malts overwhelm the flavours. Finish is strong and robust with dark malt to the fore.

2858,"2012-04-27",4.0,"Nov 2009: Brown 33cl bottle (2007 version, PNP No4) obtained from De Bierboom beershop in Brugge.

Poured into my Westmalle chalice and reviewed while eating a brown breadroll filled with Wiltshire cured ham and lettice (no pickles or anything strong).

Dark, very dark brown, ruby/black with a thin tan coloured head on top, poured the whole bottle in, so some sediment could just be seen sinking to the bottom of the glass as the beer settled down. A thick collar stayed during the review, the thin head turning into a couple of wispy islands.

A slight vingarous aroma was evident at first, then liquorice and toasted/roasted malts, coffee notes too.

Liqourice dominated the taste for me, with a spicey coffee aftertaste once the liquorice subsided a little.

Rich and warming body, the alcohol is well hidden and you would never guess 10%ABV without reading the label. A sweetness arrives in the aftertaste, not coying, but this isnt a sour Belgian.

Un peu comme la mer du Nord à La Panne un soir dhiver avec des 
nuages noirs dorage ... De Pannepot, the old fishermans ale, OK.
Ambiance donc pour démarrer ma seconde dégustation de cette bière,
mieux reposée que ma première absorbée trop tôt après avoir voyagé
(seulement 14 jours, un peu ""just"") Ici je vois tout de suite la différence 
dès la première bouche. 
Moralité : toujours laisser 3 semaines à ses bières avant dégustation
au calme chez soi ...
Arômes identiques au premier essai : grains de café (du meilleur arabica, et bien torréfié par un vrai torréfacteur), cannelle, porto tawny,
et une pointe de pain dépices.
Première bouche avec une infinité de nuances sur le café, et surtout une
impression réellement massive sur ce goût (mais un peu moins que lors de mon premier essai ""remué""), de la chicorée aussi (celle dOrchies dans le Nord de la France, le jour où lusine fait la fabrication....
vous devez absolument y aller), de lorge, des prunes, des fruits secs,
un zeste dorange et du pampelemousse en rétronasal. Superbe.
Seconde bouche sur la cannelle, le pruneau, la poire, la figue, les
amandes et le blé....
Troisième bouche où le café revient mais en finesse, des grains moulus, et une pointe de cognac. Alors là, cest le pompon..., le ""top of 
the game"", le côté magistral de cette bière.
Une finale comme une veillée de Noël au coin du feu, en douceur et un
peu en rêve dans les yeux.
Si la bière vous apporte cela, vous pouvez dire que vous avez dans votre
verre le top du savoir-faire, lexcellence dun produit et le résultat dun art
aux bases millénaires.

2858,"2012-03-12",4.0,"Bottle shared with ClubGonzo, always a pleasure. Has a pretty deep and cloudy brown colour with a light brown head. The aroma is heavenly and  complex where I sence dried fruit (more than Ive ever senced in any other beer), raisins, brown sugar, milk chocolate, cherry, sweet biscuits, something burned, and some perfume like the hint of alcohol. The taste feels in a way easier with more obvious signs of dried fruit and alcohol, but also sweet malt reminiscent of roasted almonds, often usuall in the Christmas period, and some caramel. Yes, this could be well suited on Christmas Eve. A full-bodied beer with a nice medium bitterness with a nice dose of carbonation that plays on the tongue. Without doubt a quality beer that is both round and very pleasant to drink.","Bodø, NORWAY","Foffern"
2858,"2012-03-12",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/9/2011.  Poured from a 330 mL bottle into a tulip.

Out of the bottle Pannepot has a very dark brown hue with cashew edges and a dollop of tan froth. The head retains nicely and leaves fluffy lace on the glass.

The aroma is actually not as powerful as I would have thought. Raisins, plums, gooey caramel, clove, and licorice are all present.

The trademark of Struise beers seems to be how well the flavors blend together, and this is no exception. It takes a good amount of concentration to pull out the flavors. Up front raisins and plums stand out from the other dark fruits and are touched with some sweet caramel and unsweetened chocolate. The spice character ranges from clove and anise to all spice and cinnamon. Toward the finish a bit of orange peel and a flourish of alcohol wind down the sip.

Although it looks thick and has a high ABV, this does not drink very heavy. The smooth and creamy feel is only interrupted by a soft alcohol prick on the tongue. Although there is some sweetness to start, it dries out a fair amount by the end of the sip. Medium carbonation and a medium body overall.

Struise make so many quality beers that I have high expectations going into each new one I try. This is nice, but I dont think it quite lives up to my lofty expectations.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

A - Pours black mocha-colored head, thin ring, thin film on top.

S - Struise yeasty malty sweetness, dark fruits, plums, raisins, candies. The booze is well-hidden the by the big sugary sweetness...not sure if thats good or bad. Pretty sweet.

T - Candy, spices, sweet dark fruit, slight boozy kick. More plums, raisins, figs, etc. Again, pretty darn sweet but I do get more booze on the palate when compared to the nose, so at least theres a little more going on here. Finish is an oaky fruity sweetness.

M - Full, smooth, good carbonation, dry oak finish.

O - A little too sweet and slightly boozy right now. I think the 2010 vintage needs some more time to smooth out and loose some of the overpowering sugary sweetness.

this drink had a dark brown pour with yellow-brown and coffee tan colored bubbled head that eventually lowered to a thick cover with a good billowing effervescent island (this drink was a dark ruby with brown at the edges of the glass when held up to a light), 
the bottom of the bottle was completely covered with black, caked sediment, 

the aromas were cherry, roasted malt, fruit citrus, mild spice, dark bread, caramel and faint brown sugar sweetness, 
I had to let this ale warm up a bit before the nose revealed its goodness, but even letting this drink warm up, the nose is not as strong as I thought it would be, 

there were dry, dark malt flavors, dark bread, chocolate, Bakers Chocolate (no sweetness) and chocolate cake 
with dark fruit flavors of prune and raisin, faint yeast and light spice, 
it had a small tartness on the palate, there was lots of malt flavor without the sweetness that I am used to tasting in a BSA (this ale was dry for a BSA), it had some initial sweetness but it turned dry thereafter and had some bitterness at the finish and afterwards, 
there was some alcohol warmth on the palate but was hardly noticeable (the alcohol was hidden well), pouring in the sediment of the bottle dulled the flavors a bit, 

the mouth feel was medium with generous carbonation, 

this drink was different than what I thought it would be, it had more tartness than what I was expecting, and the nose was not as big as I was expecting, I found much more flavor than what was present on the nose, again, I found this beer had lots of malt flavor with little sweetness.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

2858,"2011-11-08",4.2,"This beer is the 2011 version. The beer is a bit young but its ready to go. The beer was served in a goblet.

Ar- The aroma of the beer is very complex. Lots of dark fruits raisins, figs and prunes. A splash of mixed berries. A nicely spicey clove infused caramel maltyness. 

Ap- The body of the beer is dark brown almost black. Very minimal ruby opaqueness to light. The head is a cinnamon tinged brown. Nice retention noted. The lacing on the side of my glass is a road map.

T- The beer delivers a majorly caramel bready maltyness. Lots of fruit tones and notes in the beers flavor. Dark fruit raisins, figs a bit of cider notes. A bit of nutty flavors appear time to time. Floral and leathery notes combine with a nice spiceyness. Alcohol is barely present in the flavor.

A - Pours murky dark brown with a one finger tall khaki colored head leaving fragmented rings of lace down the glass.
S - Smells of dark fruits; raisins, dates, and figs mostly; candied sugar sweetness, slightly funky yeast, and some light alcohol burn at the end of each sniff.
T - Starts off with lots of dark fruits, similar to the nose, that quickly give way to a mix of toffee, candied sugar, funky yeast, and even more sweetness. The booze begins to creep in after each sip, leaving the pallet dry. The finish is a mix of sweetness and dulled booze, lingering on the pallet for some time.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Big, syrupy, feel with a good amount of booze toward the end of each sip. As big as it feels it remains easy to drink.
O - Its a sipper for sure but there is no doubt that this is one of the best quads out there. I would never drink this one every day but I would have no problem drinking this one every so often.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

The aroma hits me in the face as I pour, wow, its been a while since a beer struck me like that from 18"" away!  Aroma is that tart, fresh bakers yeast found in the best trappists (like st bernardus trippel or corsendonk blond in particular).  burnt spiced bread crust, light pine and coffee, yes! coffee.  cocoa.  Now for a taste.  Medium bodied with quite a bit of carbonation, fine little pricks on the palate, not creamy, but not the big prickly feeling I sometimes get, and... its tastes like I would expect based on the aroma: sweet malt with a rather spicy raisin bread and crust.  Nice banana alcohol burn, but after 5 seconds I exhale and I get those spices: I actually dont have the vocabulary for what Im tasting in that.  Is it wood, bark? combined with liquorice?  something like that perhaps.  More than likely its a spice that I simply am not used to identifying in beer, or just a new and very unique Belgian yeast strain, but wow, that aftertaste is the highlight of the beer, it lingers around for a full minute and youre still left wondering.  Old, yummy smelling mahogany.  As it warms I get more and more tart refreshing yeast and alcohol burn.  The lovely malt sweetness is more apparent in the aroma.  I actually feel bad giving this beer a rating.  On a first edit I actually had ""wow"" written five times in this review!

The nose is young but very nice with chocolate cake, spiced cake, blueberries, red currant, figs, sliced almonds, strong wisps of alcohol, toasted caramel, light molasses, and faint herbs.  The flavor is similar with similar fruit (blueberry, red currant, fig), very toasty, still molasses and almonds, cake-like notes all over, chocolate, cinnamon, gingerbread, and slight roast.

The complexity was high, the fruitiness was immense, and the malt richness was very nice.  Very abt-ish in nose and flavor but carried a lighter, less heavy body; with the stronger sense of alcohol in this one, I expected the beer to drink slower but with the clean palate and pleasant fruity accents, it drank rather quickly for a beer of 10%.

2858,"2011-07-26",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2011 2007 ""infected"" batch. 11.2 oz bottle into a chimay goblet. Reviewed on 7/27/2011. This is my third bottle of this batch and all of them had an extremely slow gush over. Upon pouring it the head began to dissolve violently and it actually looked like it was boiling. I also usually try and pour out every drop, but when it began to come out like cold maple syrup I poured it into the bottle cap. The last few drops were milky brown and smelled kind of weird, like funky molasses. 

A - Dark brown syruppy body with some red tints. The head is mocha colored with random splotches of dark brown. Awesome lacing and it even has legs! Lots of rapid bubbling happening on the surface. Some mocha looking phloegm forming on the bottom. 3.5/5

S - Candied dark fruits, spice, malt, sweet burnt sugar, and some alcohol twang. 4.0/5

T - Very bubbly and meaty mouthfeel. Taste starts off with sweet candied figs, spices and brown sugar, then an odd bitterness comes in. It is really sweet, but the aftertaste is a bit herbal and savory. The alcohol comes out a bit as it warms up. It does have a fairly sterotypical quad taste, it just has an odd aftertaste that I can imagine some people finding ""offensive"" or ""unenjoyable"". Some sips actually taste like old cola syrup...weird. 3.5/5. Mouthfeel - 4.0/5

O - Its infected for sure, but in an odd way I quite enjoy it. This particular batch does have some redeeming qualities. The sticky sweetness and bitterness is actually somewhat enjoyable and unique. Its just something I have to be in the mood to enjoy. 3.5/5

2010 vintage. 11.2 oz bottle into a chimay goblet. Reviewed on 8/1/2011. No gush over!

A - Dark brown cola body and a light khaki head. Quick falling lace and weak retention. Due to some experience with Pannepots now, I swirled and poured the last 2 ounces into a snifter. That appeared lighter with an almost milky brown color. Yeast sits on the bottom of the snifter.

S - Dark caramelized fruits, chocolate, spices, roasted malts, and some alcohol. A touch of something herbal and medicinal towards the end.

T - Figs, bitter roasted malts, sweet candi sugar, some coffee and chocolate notes. Molasses and dark spices as well. Alcohol is presented really well but is noticeable. Velvety medium mouth feel. Quite tasty.

O - Much better than the infected batch I had. This is at the top of my quadruple list. Very delicious and rich. I would love to try some other vintages now.

Overall score is based off the 2010 vintage.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

2858,"2011-06-26",4.6,"2007 bottle, from web shop Etre Gourmet. Time to get the last, missing link of the Pannepot-family to the table (well, except the Pannepot Wild, but thats another story) for rating. I deserve this after a long day of being productive around the house. :-) Pours a near-black deep brown body with a medium creamy caramel-hued retention, settling like a tiny carpet as the bubbles come to rest. Very nice indeed. The aroma is smooth, dense and virtually flowing from the glass as I pour: raisins, fresh (!) red plums, wood, dark candy sugars. Hints of burnt caramel, alcohol, figs and prunes. Taste is smooth as expected, with a veritable fan of tastes spreading over my palate: first, a fresh, carbonation-fueled hint of red berries and tart wooden tones (feels amazingly fresh for a 2007 vintage!), then a light spread of alcohol, near-tart plumes, sweet raisins and figs. Some oxidization comes through here as well, but that only seems to magically blend in with the brew somehow! Incredible. In the end, dark candy sugars and prunes land it all with some caramel and hints of burnt sugar. Mouthfeel is always pearly, like a good strong Belgian ale is supposed to, and the beer is very filling and subtly warming away with its 10 % ABV - which are generally extremely well hidden. So now I know for sure. A Pannepot is definitely a beer to cellar, and although I think the fresher versions are also extremely tasty this is really a gem. Buy one now, drink in 4-5 years. No sweat. Truly a masterpiece from Struise. :-)","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

Flavor is a rich, brown-sugar and fruit based malt balanced against modest hops, all colored by a perfect level of roastiness, earthy tones, and alcohol. Finish reveals lighter fruits and coriander.

Aroma is sweet with a caramel note. Strong with some alcohol in there. A hint of some acetic sour too, I hope that doesnt mean that this is souring.

Beer is medium to thin in the body. The carbonation is a little harsh on the palate but its OK. There is some sweetness up front and a hint of acetic sourness. Second taste, the carbonation kind of blocks the front palate notes of this beer. There is some sweetness and caramel notes in the back with a hint of roast.

Overall its a good beer but it is over carbonated. This may be due to the age on this bottle. I really enjoyed it. Its an excellent example of a quad.

2858,"2011-02-13",4.5,"Rating #600.  Tasted on 2/13/11 from a 330mL bottle purchased at West Lakeview Liquors, 2006 Vintage.  Pours very dark red, almost looks like a very hazy red wine, with a massive tan head that slowly recedes, leaving lace along the inside of the glass, to thick, rocky, and spotty lace.  The nose is very intense with caramel malt, a good amount of roast, and fruitiness that ranges from dried figs and raisins, to very vinous along with some cinnamon and other baking spices, vanilla, and some candi sugar sweetness.  The flavor starts off with the sweeter candi sugar, vanilla, and dried fruits, moving to the baking spices and more roasted notes, and finishing with the vinous flavor and light bitterness, with the caramel flavor present throughout.  The body is medium with average carbonation and a super long and complex finish that although dominated by vanilla and caramel, also contains all of the other flavors mentioned in this rating at some point.

2858,"2011-01-18",3.8,"Poured into a goblet. 2007 vintage.

4.5 A: Super dark brown color, pretty much black. Two fingers of tan creamy head with good retention and lots of lacing around the entire glass.

5.0 S: Wow does this smell good! At first I was impressed with how fruity it is, but soon after layers of complexity (all good) started coming through. TONS of fruity plum with fig and some black cherry as well. Underneath, there is a sweet milk chocolate with even sweeter dark crystal malts and the slightest touch of roastiness. Alcohol is minimal at most and complements rather than interfering.

4.0 T: Very surprising. The taste isnt much like the nose at all. The fruitiness comes in the form of prunes instead of plum (similar, I know, but different enough). Lots of tobacco and raisin this time. Not really any chocolate, but the roasted character is stronger. The downfall of the taste is the alcohol. While it was barely in the nose, its probably the strongest component in the taste.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Good heavy carbonation that is very spritzy. Not so smooth though due to lingering sweetness and alcoholic tinge on finish.

3.5 D: Excellent smelling with a good taste, but the aftertaste doesnt do it for me. At $6, it was well worth it because the nose was phenomenal.

Head was enlarged due to an amateur poor by myself - came  in over two fingers. The beer was darker than I anticipated but is very appealing. Head retention was surprisingly short and virtually no lacing occurred.

The aroma is incredibly complex. There are dark fruits immediately present with cherries most noticeable and plums and raisins in the background. It took numerous sniffs to identify but the other prominent aroma I can detect is brown sugar. The aroma has numerous other treasures to discover but my nose was not feeling up to the task on this day.

The taste mimics the aroma and includes a lot of dark fruit, some brown sugar, and a bit of a bready taste. I also taste roasted malts and some chocolate that were not foreshadowed by the aroma. The finish almost has a faint coffee taste and betrays the presence of the 10% ABV.

Nose is big, sweet fruits with raisins and dates dominating. Pours a dense black with a fine head dissipating quickly. 

It was five minutes after popping the top before I poured it, but it was slowly effervescing and dribbling foam and beer out the top of the bottle. As soon as I poured it, the carbonation quickly finished, though.

There is a quick bitterness in the taste of this one that nicely balances the ripe fruits promised in the nose. 

Palate, for me, is the strongest suite for this one. There is a creamy texture just slightly buzzed by the light carbonation. The bitterness rides lightly on the delicate carbonation and the sweetness helps make this one just smooth enough. 

Finish is just dry enough.

A - Dark cola brown with a very deep and dark chestnut and ruby hue on the edge. Very large frothy, bubbly sandy almond beige color. Good retention that settles into a nice sticky, foamy layer of lace.

S - Initial aroma has a strong licorice aroma along with plenty of tart dark fruit consisting of plum, prune, fig, and raisin. Some grape aroma is also present. Strong spiced aroma comes out as well with nutmeg and cinnamon being two of the stronger ones. Also has a fairly strong oaky/wine like aroma in the background, and some dark candi sugar comes out too. Interesting and complex aroma with a large variety of aromas.

T - Similar to the nose. Starts off with some licorice, dark candi sugar/molasses. Then some dark fruit with a mix of plum, prune, and fig along with some grape and cherry. These start off somewhat sweet, and then becomes a bit more tart. Fair amount of spiced flavor comes out too. Hints of chocolate come out mid sip. Finishes with a bit more of the oaky/vinous type of taste, and some more sweetness. Like the nose, this is very complex.

A- Beautiful coca-cola brown colored body that pours with a 1 finger off white root beer colored head which has perfect retention and plenty of lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- Nose is sweet and complex. A cola like scent comes up first with a sugary sweetness. Behind this is a big malt presence and a bit of alcohol.

T- Cola, anise and plum upfront with a substantial bready yeast backbone. A bit of astringent bitterness comes through alogn with a spicy yeast flavor for the finish as the other flavors remain consistent.

P- Wonderful, full, very smooth yeasty body. Low-to-medium carbonation.

Delicious, dessert-like brown sugar flavors with figs, dates, a spiced-and-spicy undercurrent (cinnamon, artisan bread, ginger crisp cookies, a touch of anise seed, peppery alcohol), and just enough yeasty tanginess to balance the dizzying malt array.  Even touches of rauchmalt smoke and tobacco.  Lots of delightful sugary accents (toasted treacle, molasses) without being cloying-- the carbonation does wonders.  Long and lovely finish with beautiful, relatively high carbonation for the boldness and gravity.  Perfect structure.

Good strong taste with a bit of ""drop""-taste it seems. The taste changes when you nip till you swallow, very complex. Very much sweetness, and a nice oily-sticky mouthfeel. Really like this one. Also the aftertaste holds for a long time, and even that one seems to change. Without a doubt a great beer. Fruity, but on a nice way. Sweetness is a big part of this beer.

Edit: At 10 sept 2010 tasted a 2004 version. So 6 years old. A bit lighter it seems at the first sight. Still a good sized head, smells more earthy and a bit weird burned. Prunes comes trough. Smell is less then a fresh one in my opinion. Very sweet, really more sweet then expected. Taste prunes, chocolate, fruits. Very complex, maybe even complexer then a fresh one. Caramel, sucre, sucre, sucre, but also other tastes comes up to make it that complex, but to much sweetness for sure. I slightly prefer a fresh one, that is more balanced.

It pours a deep brown, almost black, with hints of red. A persistent tan head tops it off. The aroma is quite sweet - caramel, roast, maple syrup, leather, apricot and plum. The flavor is even more impressive, and changes shape several times after taking a sip. First a wave of malty, dark fruit sweetness hits, followed by the tang of red wine, and finally chocolate and the tiniest hint of booze in the finish. Thick, creamy body.

2858,"2009-11-28",4.1,"2006 vintage.

Very dark brown with a minimal pale beige head that settles instantly and leaves basically no lacings.

Sweet malts and lots of fruit aromas (mostly plums and currants) in the nose. Prominent but mild spiciness. Woody notes, a hint of chocolate and some alcohol. A pleasant and balanced smell, but its somewhat restrained - its almost like its character is too round.

The taste is basically just more of the same. Lost of sweet malts and rich flavors of fruits (plums, cherries, currants). Dark bread. Hints of chocolate, a general woody flavor and pleasant spices (reminiscent of Christmas spices). Some earthy yeast (that really gets bigger when the yeast sediments are poured into the glass, the yeast in this one really packs a lot of flavors). For some reason, in all the versions if Pannepot Ive had, I think I pick up a taste that reminds me of Coca Cola, dont know how to describe it in any other way though. A light, not very tangy, tart note and some grassy hops in the middle. The finish is gently bitter with a decent amount of sweet alcohol and some wood, raisins, cherries and spices.

Rather full-bodied, very smooth texture. Mild carbonation.

A good beer. Tasty and balanced with a very round character. I really like how well the sweet malts and fruit esters go with the spices in this one. But overall, the flavors are a little too round and it almost feels like the beer holds back a little. I wonder how if would come out if everything was turned up a notch of two.

2858,"2009-11-19",4.1,"12 oz bottle.  A mellow aroma, yet rich and complex at the same time. Interesting notes of fruity strawberry shortcake, with light bit of funk stand out to me. Also, some prominent yeasty dark malts and nutty toffee, with light candy sugars, and some minor wine qualities. The pour had a medium-large soft, pillowy caramel cream head, a full body, and a dark amber brown color. Theres a very nice rich sweetness to this beer that is not unlike an expensive piece of candy youd find wrapped in a box. Besides the slight hint of alcohol, this beer feels nowhere near 10% abv even with all the flavors. The feel overall has a lot of sugar crystal qualities to it, but this is mixed with a good full creaminess to add to the uniqueness of this beer. Notes on this one definitely lean toward the malty sweetness, but its really in no way unbalanced . It starts out with a more deep , caramel-toffee, brown sugar cake sweetness, then gives way to some darker fruits, light olive and cheese, toasted malts, and light woody hops in a drier than expected finish. This beer definitely proves its world class status, but didnt separate itself at all (like I was hoping) from the Pannepøt, which I also thoroughly enjoyed.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"

Appearance: Extremely dark brown with hazy ruby highlights and a monstrous foamy tan head.  The head lasts for ages and the alcohol leaves nice legs on the glass.

Flavor: Rich, yet light and dry all at the same time.  Warming alcohol, a fruity tartness, yeasty dust, some earth, loads of spice, and a slight touch of oxidation on the tongue.  Very complex stuff.  A slight medicinal note emerges towards the middle of the beer.  Bits of raisin, mace, cardamon, and just enough sweetness to help balance all of the flavors.

2858,"2009-08-12",4.9,"Pours a lovely dark brown with a big fluffy head that doesnt last long.

Nose smells is sweetly alcoholic at first, chocolate and dark fruits an which then give way to sharper barnyard like herbal and wood aromas maybe apples too.

Taste is amazing, strong but not overpowering alcholic warmth, deep roasted fruit flavours, spices, a touch of lambic like sourness.

Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy but carbonated enough that this is very pleasant.

2858,"2009-08-10",4.1,"Small 330 ml bottle (2007) from Cracked Kettle. Simply beautiful appearance: dark brown with a beige, large bubbly head leaving a small. steady espresso head as it quite rapidly dissipates. Definitely some milk chocolate in the aroma but also some sourness, apples and some strong notes of herbs, nuts, figs and an undertone of alcohol. Roasted, sweet malts and coffee are strong in the flavor as well as nuts, some mild sourness (apples) and spices. A  subtle burn of alcohol and a lovely dry, roasted maltiness in the aftertaste. Quite full yet well-carbonated in the palate, actually the contrast is quite nice. Definitely a tasty beer, but to be honest, not as fantastic as I expected. Maybe Pannepot Reserva will fill my expectations fully.","Helsinki, FINLAND","SaulusHumulus"
2858,"2009-08-09",3.9,"(330ml 2007 bottle) Pours an opaque dark chocolate brown. Nice light brown bubbly head, there are always bubbles around as I drink this one. Nose is milk chocolate, dried figs, spices and cinnamon and maybe some sweet crackers. Very complex. Taste is slight sour dried fruits, unsweetened chocolate, very carbonated and creamy. Palette finish is the best part of this beer, its not too sweet but towards the end the alcohol is becoming more and more apparent and I think it is overcarbonated. A great Quad/Strong, but maybe just shy of a top 50 beer for me.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"

More spice in the flavor, both the typical yeasty spice and added spice. Seems like there is a fair amount of hops, but that could be the spicieness. There is some dark sugar sweetness in the middle.

Nose is figs, grapes, and booze, tipped off with a Christmas-y spice like nutmeg.  Flavor is also very sweet, with lots of figs and black cherries, thick caramel sweetness layered under sharp raw sugar sweetness.  The nutmeg-like spice is accompanied by others than I cant place, but they help balance the sweetness.

Some sourness and the same qualities as the aroma. Did this on the last sip of beer. Another bottle or more will be purchased. 


Well.... if this isnt overpriced, what is? Poured out a quick death bubbly head and a solid dark brown brew. The aroma is eluding me as this lacks strength. Quite sweet, spicy with something that bites my nose like a cleaning product would - now Im not saying this smells like cleaning products so take it easy. Faint cinnamon, cherries, the dullest hint of smoke I think, molasses.... not too much else that I can notice and Ill admit that Im not in the mood to search and search for it tonight. The taste is thick, a mouth full of malts that remind me of bogs (no relation to taste), lots of spice, I just got a mouth full of yum yeasty sludge, sweet caramel, more cinnamon, figs or something, man, Im quite trashed, ginger? nutmeg. The mouth feel is thick and bordering on oily. The aftertaste is short lived but spicy with some alcohol and malts. Ill be forgoing spending money on this again. Maybe Im crapping on it because of the price but I dont think so. Good drink though, very easy to put back - just boring and quite honestly very forgettable.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Left a decent bit of sediment on glass until almost the end of glass, which I then poured in.  Aroma of lightly roasted malt, chocolate, slight coffee, caramel, and alcohol.  Flavor matches with the addition of a nice spice profile, yeast, and dried fruits.  Alcohol a little more up front than I was expecting, but it doesnt dominate the drink.  Extra sediment toward end gave a bit of a spicier flavor, which I think would have been even better to have for the entire glass.

Raisin bread, dried fruits, chocolate and cream, a touch of roast, brown sugar, and a hint of licorice spiced booze. Flavor is quite sweet as well. Lots of caramels, nuts, dates, fruitcake, chocolate, plums, and a sweet booze. A light spicing keeps this very well balanced and enhances the layers of flavor.

Dark sweet fruit upfont (dates, dark grapes, prunes), whcih is complimented immediately by Balgian candi sugar.  Then comes the chocolatey, almost stoutish flavor with a warm and spicy burning alcohol finish.  Warming on the stomach.  Lots of good flavors, but a bit too aggressive and a bit too much going on IMO. Typical of the style, this is very highly carbonated, which detracts from flavor profile for me - really fizzy carbonation is just too distracting for me.

TECHNICAL: 2007 Bottle. Poured a dark brown that was almost black in the glass with reddish orange highlights when held to the light and a small to average, fizzy, tan head that kept a nice sheet for a very long time and left just barely fair lacing. The aroma was roasted, molasses, caramel, and milk chocolate malts, light to moderate yeast, along with raisin, plum, prune, cherry, port, toffee, brown sugar, maple syrup, licorice, vanilla extract, almond extract and spices. The initial flavor was sour, lightly sweet and acidic; while the finish was sweet, lightly sour, spice and lightly bitter with an average to long duration. There was apices, coke syrup, Kahlua, yeast, molasses, maple syrup, chocolate, dark fruit, prune, plum, raisin, more yeast and licorice.

The cap popped with a some pressure and the head began to slowly climb as soon as it was removed.  I was able to pour a glass, but it was 90% head, so we had to wait for it to settle. It did settle, nicely, leaving a ton of webbing on the sides of the tulip. A tannish head rests on top of the deep brown body.  The aroma is deep and fruity with a healthy dose of ripe plums, overripe banana, burnt caramel and ethery alcohol. The body continues in the same vein - lots of plummy and sweet malts mixed with a heavy dose of alcohol. Esthery pear and apple prick the tongue.  Something a bit tart, almost cherry juice, hits the back of the tongue on the way down. Wow - a real belly warmer as the alcohol sits in the gut for a few seconds.

2007 version.
As I open it it just bubbles out of the bottle. Quite typical, so I run for the glas.
Huge head on a very very dark brown, almost black body. I can tell impurities floating around, and slowly falling to the bottom.
Sugary smell with loads of malty stuff almost coca cola in the nose.
Tasts of brown sugar, figs and other malty notes.
Very creamy and a perfect belgian beer.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","jesperhammer"

Aroma is of sweet dark fruit, cherries, sweet malt, apple, chocolate and booze. Flavor is a pretty complex mix of dark fruit, wood, spice, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is rich and full and finishes sweet and warm, with a lingering oakiness. Pretty sweet tasting overall, and a little sour. Not a bad brew, but I liked the Rochefort 8 a little better.","Joliet, Illinois, USA","monkeychugg55"

2858,"2009-05-06",4.4,"11.2-ounce bottle from City Beer, San Francisco. Pours an opaque brown with a large head that recedes slowly.

Flavor is initially a little sour but sweet after that in addition to heavy sweet malt, again a lot of dark fruit, big booze in the taste, the throat, and the esophagus. Finishes bitter. Perfect mouthfeel just makes it more delicious and makes you demand more after every swallow. Sticky, thick viscosity; Not syrupy, just thick and hearty, chunky.

2858,"2009-03-31",4.9,"Bottle into Duvel tulip; purchased at Discount in Milwaukee.  2007 vintage.  This will be about my fifth bottle of Pannepot.  Pours with a huge foamy dark beige head that dissipates somewhat rockily.  Head is firm (reminds me a bit of the High Desert stout at GABF 2004) and leaves a sudsy lace that doesnt really stick often.  Smell is an enigma: lots of CO2 from the released carbonation (giving it a spritzy feel) and a bit of Orval-ish sourness with a definite malt presence in a sugary caramel undertone and occasional rootsy chocolate.  Honestly, I cant remember a beer right now with better mouthfeel; the texture is constantly changing, but its exactly what it should be at any moment: first its sharp and a bit fizzy, but in the back; then it gets soft and foamy; right before settling into the deep, silky smooth finish; which later transitions to driness, somehow.  I cant even really begin to describe all the things in the flavor.  Its like the layering of Celebrator with the unpredictability of Orval, mixed together.  Luxurious; malty; slightly sour; sweet throughout; some overripe fruits underneath all; it almost gets dry, after being so juicy in the beginning; never gives the impression of being roasty or bitter, but its there late in the finish; on some sips, boozy; on some sips, chocolatey; on other sips, jammy like a port; sometimes in the finish theres a distinct raspberry note that reminds me of Clares Thirsty; after half a glass, figgy pomegranate jam is permanently slathered on the back of the tongue as a canvas over which all the other fleeting flavors flit.  Really, Pannepot defies my attempts at rating (at least, without devolving into flowery diction and unnecessary aliteration).  This is one of those beers that transcends dopeness, that lives in the uber-dope ether.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"
2858,"2009-03-29",4.4,"A: A deep dark brown hue with brillant red highlights showing thru. The head is average and retention is good. Spotty lace noted from top to bottom.

S: Complex aroma. Lots of dark fruits noted. Figs, raisins, and plums mostly. A touch of spice can be detected along with yeast and roasted malt.

T: Wow, this one is big thick and chewy. Huge blast of dark fruits just sit on the tongue and linger. Nice roasty malt and fruits come thru. There is a touch of spice and a splash of booze make this one extra complex.

M: Full in body thich and creamy. Wonderful carbonation makes this one very inviting.

Pours a dark brown that does not allow light to pass through with a moderate off-white head that lasted until mid-glass and left partial lace.  Very pleasant aroma of raisins, figs, molasses, oak, and just a bit of smokiness.  The flavor is equally lovely but different from the aroma.  Not as fruity as the aroma suggests, while the malt is a stronger presence and is more earthy and a bit more smokey than in the aroma.  Some brown sugar and nutmeg are also present in the flavor.  Dries out a bit on the palate as it approaches the finish.  Full bodied.  A very enjoyable beer, although not a top 50 candidate for me personally.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"

Literally, this beer is pretty simple as far as the realm of Belgian strongs, but it is fantastically good.  As solid as it starts, the sweetness just builds as it goes.  Fantastic.  The palate is smooth and velvety at first, then a hint of buttery bitterness and a tingle of alcohol.  Top notch stuff, certainly not a let down, and done exceedingly well.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"

Long lingering flavors morph to licorice,  wine, dark grapes,  and I agree about the cherries.  For such a sweet dark beer, its very light in the mouth.  Refreshing.

Rather intriguing, aromatic nose, fairly sweet and of course spicy, with suggestions of milky chocolate, molasses, powdered sugar, orange peel, anise, nutmeg, plummy dark fruits, dark breads, cedar and touches of doughy yeast and floral perfume.  Deep, dark mahogany color, nearly opaque, with a lasting, fine, uneven head of dark tan.  Flavor is predominantly tangy, fruity and sweet, with abundant raisin and creamy chocolate, although there are subtleties to be found throughout, including spice cake, dried cherry, toffee, cinnamon and hazelnut, and with a gentle vinous, cidery tinge that enters towards the long, earthy finish.  Lingering caramel sweetness and a nigh-undetectable alcohol presence.  Incredibly smooth, creamy, light and gently warming mouthfeel, body is softly full.  Absolutely outstanding.

Une odeur avec de la classe, quelle fraîcheur! Nous pouvons rajouter de la prune et un petit côté vineuse et liquoreuse. Une bière dense et équilibré.

Cookie and mild chocolate sweetness balanced by an almost funky tartness and some alcohol.   Almost dry and woody in the back end.   Medium to full body with an almost over-carbonated airiness.   Once you let it sit a bit and get some of the bubbles out, its quite smooth, but packs some pressure for sure.   This one caught me a bit off guard.   I wasn""t expecting the acidity, but it gave an elegant balance that actually worked really well, though I think it overshadowed the spicy subtleties that many others seem to get out of this, which was fine for the most part because I could drink a few more of these with this balance.

It is a deep, deep red brown that only shows color at the very bottom edge of my chalice. The head looks soft enough to use as a pillow and shows no sign of disappearing.  As a quad, this beer has good sweetness and sourness with deep, full Belgian fruit esters mingled with godly earthiness. More directly but less accurately, the flavor favors dark stone fruits, sturdy, dry oak and perfectly toasted barley.  The feel is simply divine.

Poured a dark red-brown.  Didn’t leap out of the bottle the way the Old Monk’s Ale did.  Sturdy tan head fades to a scummy coating atop the beer.  Aroma is sour, vinegar, and somehow chalky...like Deus.  The aroma was also sour enough to me to be reminiscent of a Berlinerweisse.  Flavor is preceded by that rough, chalky mouthfeel.  Cherry-ish and very sour.  Some roastiness and a ton of sour.  I love sour, and believe it to be the flavor atop the beer hierarchy of flavors (if there is such a thing), but I’m not sure that the sour is presented here in the most attractive way...I love sour beers, and this is a very good beer with some sour elements, yet I didn’t love this beer.

Nonetheless, I would recommend it.  I obtained this bottle at Beer Mania in Brussels.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"
2858,"2008-10-21",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2010 This is arguably the best beer that I have ever had.  It blends the depth of a Rochfort 10 with the sweetness of a Stille Nacht and the malty goodness of a World Wide Stout, while barely scratching the surface.  

      It pours a deep dark brown with a slight head.  Aroma is dark fruit, cinnamon, lots of malt, candy sugar, alcohol, raisins, and other flavors yet to be experienced by the uninitiated.  It finishes incredibly smoothly and a finish that leaves the drinker remarkably enticed.  Harder to find than a Golden Flea biting an immortal two-headed goat in Florida right now.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

2858,"2008-10-13",4.6,"I grew up on the Indian River and a 10 minute walk from the ocean. Both were my playground, fishing is a lifelong passion of mine, and Hemingway an inspiration. Therefore, to partake of a fine old ale in the style and tradition of the fisherman of yore is a special treat for me. My heart definitely lies with the ocean and my body rests contentedly amidst her watery embrace.

My Struise Pannepot poured a solid black into my glass while leaving no room for the light of day anywhere within her depths. A fat thick cappuccino tinged head rises and fades into a foamy blanket on top. From the first to the last quaff, that blanket rests on top of her body as if to protect her from the elements. A sweet nip in the nose is quickly overwhelmed by winter spices of cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted chestnuts, and hints of fresh rhubarb pie. Wow. All that in just a few whiffs of the nose. Impressive and tantalizing all at the same time. Not one to keep a lady waiting, I delve into her watery depths and am greeted by a very frothy body and mouthfeel which belies her appearance. Sweet and creamy, I taste dark cherries, rhubarb, and spices. A bit chewy, my Struise Pannepot is sweet and vegetal at the same time. Not to be outdone, further exploration reveals more dark fruits and a hint of vanilla peeks through as her waters warm. The finish is smooth, sweet, spicy and warming. A perfect restorative while out fishing Mother Oceans cold watery depths or after docking from a long day appeasing her fickle nature. All the way down to my last quaff a spider web network of brussels lace sticks to the sides of my glass like sargassum. Magnificent.

While I could enjoy my Struise Pannepot at any time of the year, she is definitely more of a winter brew. From start to finish I was bewitched by her seductive call, like the sirens of lore. If I could get my hands on another bottle, I wouldnt hesitate a moment, and if I could get my hands on a case, I wouldnt hesitate either. Now, wheres my Hemingway. I have a hankering for The Old Man and the Sea.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

2858,"2008-09-29",4.3,"A nice, deep brown... the head on here leaves a beautiful, creamy looking sheet that seems that it will continue to stick around until drinking begins. It’s a lighter tan. 

 This smells beautiful... toffee scents, a definite spiciness... I can’t make out all of what is coming together there; it’s all rather complex and rich. Cinnamon? Allspice? Clove? A little chocolate, and hints of dark fruit - raisin and date. 

A delicious medley of malt roast, spices, toffee, dark fruits, some spotty notes of anise, maybe (most notable post-finish). Alcohol makes an appearance, but there’s plenty else going on here to not pay attention to it - that’s to say, it’s not really ’hidden’; it’s just a little part of the bigger picture. 

Full body, somewhat creamy, somewhat foamy. A very nice feeling brew, with a pleasant warming on the way down. It’s rather candy-like and makes for an incredibly easy drinker. It’s somewhat tempting to drink it quickly, but exercising some patience is very rewarding. An excellent take at the style, and would do very well among some of the abbey brews.

2858,"2008-07-31",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2009 2006 bottle (7/31/08). Pours dark mahogany with a large, supple beige head and lacing. The nose doesnt announce itself across the room, but take a close whiff and fall backwards: sweet malts with raisins, burnt sugar, and a buttery cream; a touch of wine and alcohol, like whiskey; some lighter elements like refreshing fruits and flowers; and hints of chocolate. Its so coherent, but wait until you taste it: sweet with more dried fruit, sugar, alcohol, hints of smoke... all as one. Its full bodied and oh so lush, and the finish... my mouth is soaking up the experience long after its gone. 06 - 1049519 

06 and 07 bottle (11/13/09) - More fruit and alcohol in the 07, sweeter and also with a lightly creamy sour note. Still some great complexity with a lot of berry and plum fruits, light raisin, and a range of malt notes. The 06 is darker, larger, more-tan head. More nut, malt, and candi sugar, less tart fruit of the 07. I prefer the 06, though its starting to show signs of over-carbonation drowning out the flavor like Rochefort struggles with.the experience long after its gone. 06 - 859418, 07 - 848417","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

Altogether better than the Reserva.  The flavors in this are just a bit more clear and not muddled whatsoever.  While this has no barrel aging characteristics or the wine notes of the Reserva, this is still wonderfully complex with a great spice/brown sugar/raisin taste.  Not quite as complex as the Reserva, but the flavors here mesh better and make this a truly delightful beer.

So yeah, its a great beer.  It is a wonderful dark, rich reddish brown color with a light brown head.  Aroma is dark fruits, Belgian yeast, light alcohol, and malt.  The flavor has a unique roasted maltiness joined by sweet dark fruit, chocolate, caramel, and some coffee.  A wonderful combination and balance.

Still, it is dominated by dark fruits along with coffee, roasted malt, apple, pear, and candi sugar in the background.  Awesome palate--very smooth and creamy.  Complex and well constructed, my only fault with it is that Im not a super fan of raisin/dark fruits (which isnt a fault, just a personal preference).  Very enjoyable though.  I had this back-to-back with the Pannepeut and enjoyed the flavors of the Pannepeut better but found the palate of the Pannepot to be much superior.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LilBeerDoctor"

Nearly opaque with reddish-orange highlights. Medium to full bodied and slightly sweet. Ample carbonation, but less than I had expected. The alcohol was evident and had a warming effect.

2858,"2008-05-26",4.5,"2006 edition: Eclipsed crimson. Ornately thick, lathery beige froth deposits clingy lace. Extravagantly fresh aromas of raisin bread, caramelized malt, plums, black cherries and dark rum. Elegant wafts of creamed coffee, earthy yeast, cocoa, vanilla, bubblegum, cinnamon and clove. Creamy, tiny-bubbled carbonation gently caresses the palate. Spicy alcohol paves the way for a vibrant, tongue-coating rush of banana pudding and vanilla- and putty-accented yeast. Alcohol augments the dryness but is exquisitely cloaked, and its sparse remnants are blanketed by the pillow-soft body and delicate yeastiness. Vibrant rum-infused plum flavors are enriched by a rich and squeaky-clean bready malt undertow. Dainty whispers of wafery malt contribute softness to the deep malt frame. Body is perfect as the malts are well-structured and the esters equally lustrous. Finespun bubblegum flavors add to the estery luster while a dusting of cocoa bolsters the earthiness. Sugary residuals flash their sweetness before a cleansing  leathery dryness and astringency cleans things up. Never remotely cloying or medicinal despite the copious amount of sugars in this. Finishes immaculately attenuated with an equilibrium of plum, raisin, and chocolate malt notes. Notes of rummy alcohol and leather linger. Man, what a fantastic nose! So rich and aromatically malty, yet extremely subtle with a dizzying array of yeast-derived complexity at the same time.  In my opinion, this beer has always relied too heavily on the candy sugar and has consequently suffered from overt sweetness and subpar attenuation. Gotta say, though, that this bottling has drastically improved over the past year as it is now remarkably cohesive and elegant rather than cloyingly medicinal. Its now clear to me - and I say this without hesitation - when this beer brings its A game, its is on par with the best Belgian Strongs/Abbot 12s of the world.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Aroma is very complex with dark fruits, red wine, sweet bread, candi sugar, and dark chocolate that each alternate in intensity everytime I take a sniff.  Upon warming, some roasted malt notes even make an appearance.  This is just great smelling.  Taste is also the similar to the aroma, and starts out with dark fruits like plum and raisin.  In mid-palate, the flavor takes a turn to more dark chocolate, and yet makes another change into more of a red wine flavor.  The finish then yields a spicy and equally yeasty flavor.  The complexity of this taste is amazing.  When exhaling you can get a nice taste of the dark chocolate as well.  The faintest hint of alcohol is present in the flavor, but it never intrudes.

The hardy, earthy flavours of years side-by-side with faintly sticky, sugary candy notes, as well as slight notes of gingerbread and espresso. A lingering sourness that only shows up after you swallow. Amazingly thick, luxurious body. Not how Id want all my beers to taste, but its an impressive accomplishment.

Intense chocolate liqueur nose, brown sugar, bitter almonds, sugar snap peas, corriander. Warm chocolate flavor, brownies fresh from the oven, calvados, dried figs. Very sweet up front, and even a fair dose of leathery sweetness in the finish, but without being sticky.

I love the vibrant body that these dark Belgian strongs get, it seems to combine extremes quite nicely. The nose is toffee and yeast, with some warm spice in there just faintly. But once you get into the beer, the spices emerge marvelously along with plums, anise, and port.

Deep chocolate brown; most noticeable in the aroma and taste are the herbs and spices, which make it go in a very different direction from other dark Belgians where dark fruit and caramelized sugars are at the fore (though those flavors are present here too). The spices add a maritime quality, a sort of beer version of Scotch whiskies that taste of the sea. Id love to try other vintages and the Reserva.","New York, New York, USA","nparikh"

Great head retention for a 10% ABV beer. Aroma of plums dominates over some brown sugar and spiced iced-tea with a malt background. Anise adds a bit of a sharpness that brings out some dark over-brewed tea. Something ashy that gives a fire-roasted note can be picked up now and then. Upon tasting you notice the ABV. Malt is a little more pronounced in the flavor but still gets dominated by brown sugar with intermingled dark fruits including black plums. Dark raisin and a wood note add some nice earthiness.

Dark brown and opaque with an exploding head, which unfortunatly resulted in some of the brew spilling onto the table, so be aware. Aroma is intense, extremly fruity and vinouse with strong alchohol and molasses, like a quad should be, but with a nice edge of roasted chocolate. The intensity is carried into the flavor, where the fruity sweetness along with the alchohol and roasted bitterness just makes it extremly delicious.

2858,"2008-03-05",3.9,"Wow...this beer is huge. Aroma was pretty strong. Strong malt and yeasty aroma with a hint of farts. Pour was deep dark brown with a nice 1 finger tan head that faded down to a thin ring after a minute. Taste was very big and bold. Strong malt with toffee and molasses fills the mouth with dark roasted malt in the aftertaste. The mouth dries after the swallow and the great carbonation combines with a yeasty bite. A little too big for my tastes but it is a great beer. Im going to try the other version next.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
2858,"2008-03-04",4.0,"Bottle (33 cl) at Kulminator, Antwerp, Belgium. Dark brown with a rich creamy beige head. Intense malt aroma, sugary and slightly roasted, with spices and molasses. Medium bodied, just a bit too much carbonation to get the highest palate score.  Quite sweet, with a dry finish that dos not completely balance up the sweetness.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","ekstedt"
2858,"2008-03-03",3.8,"2006 bottle: pours dark brown with ruby around the bottle bulb of the glass.  The head pours about 2 fingers high and rocky slowly going down to a thick film over most of the top.  a beautiful beer.  Aroma is vinous, with some roastiness, and yeastiness.  It still maintains a fresh note on the tale end of the aroma, somewhat piney, and with some traces of alcohol.  Flavor is rich, with a particular slightly oily taste.  beer is roasty, but not stout like.  the aftertaste is very rich, yet dry, and spicy.  Flavor as you drink showcases different spices.  ginger at times, and cardamom.  It seems also that there is a touch of coriander that accentuates the spiciness of the hops.  As the finish approaches the beer shows some caramel character, and what I think is a smokiness.  I also detect some soy... actually the last sip was all soy and spice.  mouth feel is very active, sometimes a couple too many bubbles to really get the flavor of the beer.  This wasnt really a beer I loved, I enjoyed the unconventionalness of it, but it didnt strike me as great.  I have one more bottle that I will sample later.  Definitely enjoyed the oak aged better, and would like to try it again.","Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, USA","jehoey"

Spiced dark malts, toffee and pine are blended together perfectly to make what is easily one of the best smelling brews Ive had.  Very holiday-ish brew, I could imagine sitting by the christmas tree on a snowy night sipping on this.  Wonderfully carbonated mouth feel.  Dark roasted malts, cloves, cinnamon and some dark fruits come through in the taste.  Has a perfectly balanced peppery finish to it.  Damn near perfect.","Ft Wayne, Indiana, USA","bdigital"

2858,"2008-02-21",4.6,"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle (2006) and served in a St. Sixtus trappist glass.  This beer poured a deep, dark brown with a thin head of tan foam that lasted throughout the entire glass.  A decent amount of slippery lacing was left behind.  The aroma of the beer was made up of sugary sweet dark fruits, caramel, candi sugar, chocolate, and some light alcohol.  The flavor consisted of bakers chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, dried dark fruits, and a healthy dose of warming alcohol.  Really, really tasty!  The mouthfeel was lush and silky smooth with a light amount of soft carbonation.  This beer deliveried an excellent aroma along with a huge, complex array of flavors.

2858,"2008-02-19",4.3,"Ive never had a pour quite like this. The yeasty sediment was wonderfully visible in the last cloudy drops that fell from the bottle into my chalice that is reserved for such world-class brew-vadery. The aroma about knocked me over with strong dried prunes and burned brown sugar. The beer is very malty, creamy, and full on the tongue. The yeasty breadiness is evident throughout the experience. The flavor is complex and well-balanced with the warm presence of brown sugar, caramel, cloves, and dried fruits. The finish is clean with a slight alcohol burn and the Belgian ""apple-white grape thing"" (as one reviewer noted). This is one rich beer and took me a good thirty minutes to drink, but every sip a savor!

Reminded me a lot of Rochefort 10 with strong dark fruit raisin/prune flavor, but this one, while super sweet, was nicely balanced with a whole host of other fruits, candied sugar.

Raisiny brown sugar upon first taste with a very mild alcohol chaser and some molasses there on the back end as well. Palate is a bit thick for my taste, but if slightly cloying stickness is to your taste, this thing has body to burn. Almost reminds me of some richer American sweet stouts. Its saving grace is that it has Belgian yeast in spades, so even though its a powerful brew, you get the underlying apple-white grape thing and that just adds to the complexity. Very good.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","BritAlesRule"
2858,"2008-02-11",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2011 2006 33 Bottle. Pours deep dark brown with a mocha creamy head the fades fast into thin craters.  Wonderful aroma of nutty varnish, vinegar, & nutmeg.  Dark molasses, nuts, spice, sweet rich malt,  brown sugar, burned toffee, dark fruits, and well hidden alcohol.  Milk chocolate, sherry, tobacco & raisin finish, ever so slightly bitter. This ones got everything, its an acid trip of flavors. Very syrupy, nice light fine carbonation, except not enough to match the viscosity of the body, which makes it more of a dessert beer.  I kinda want to pour it over pancakes.  This stuff is very very good.  After a while it starts to take on some Imp Stout characteristics.  This is not beer (ale) contrary to what is says on the label, but rather delicious delicious candy. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

2007 33 Bottle enjoyed 1/12/09 lot B 7 BB.  Noticeably more varnish in the aroma, more on the sour side.  Flavors not quite as developed, still very very tasty, definitely more on the flemish brown/sour side of things, a lot more acid than I remember.   Not as dark and viscous as the 2006 bottles, light and airy... I almost thought I opened a bottle of the Danish version by mistake...??? Supremely drinkable. 10.5.10.4.18  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

2007 33 bottle enjoyed 9/19/09 lot A 2 CC.  Been way too long since I opened a Pannepot.  Pours a dark dark unclear tootsie-roll color with a huge tall foamy light tan head 4.5.  Oooooooo!!! I love the aroma.  It brings me right back to the farm.  I close my eyes and its almost like being there.  Ridiculously unique spicy rich aroma, a little milky this time, the roast barley is magnificent, varnish, peanut butter, nutty, hay, vinous, tootsie-roll chocolate, milk duds  9.  First sip, mmmm, what?, mmm, thinking thinking, been a while since Ive had one of these, takes a second to acclimate to the strong unique taste once again, rich dark syrup, grassy chocolate, lots of fruit this go, sweet dark fruits, rum cake, molasses, spices that Im not even going to begin to guess at, I definitely see the stout influences this time, some light acidity, finishes very rich with bitter tobacco and rum raisin aftertaste.  Medium/full bodied, closer to full, somewhat viscous and syrupy but with lots of corse carbonation. Again, Ive discovered that even 60F is too cold, room temperature is a must for beers of this complexity.  I desperately want to get my hands on some more pannepeut now as Im down to my last bottle.

Delicious Felmish oude bruin type beer now, grassiness isnt really there, plenty of wonderful woody varnish and cherry, especially in the aroma, fairly well dried out but still has miles of depth and complexity, the spices dont seem like spices but are just part of the overall beer, again, very Oerbier Reserva ish which is nice! Perfectly matured right now, medium bodied, fairly dried out, nice sizzling carbonation that isnt annoying, a great balance between full bodied and dried out infected!

A lot more brown sugar/molasses, plum/purple fruits now in the aroma, nice complementary alcohol, took some time to open up but I love it, bit of a dry erase marker thing going on.  Flavor follows, more purple fruity than I remember, I remember it being more of a complex malty yeasty deal, moving more towards that trappist profile now, cola, grape, rich molasses, again the alcohol faint burn is complementary, quicker finish, with a bit of malt depth.  Just phenomenal but not quite how those early batches were full of character... the refinement is starting to set in here.  9.5.9.5.18: 4.6","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

Lots of sweet malt flavor with an ample amount of dark fruits, and spices, with the yeastiness showing through as well. Tobacco and black tea leaves, brown sugar and a small hint of spicy fruitiness.  A sweet creamy treat, with a flavor of orange marmalade and chocolate truffles.

The head was a compact, off-white stream of tight, tight bubbles that quickly faded into a galaxy swirl atop my glass.  Light lacing.  The aroma was chocolate, raisins, yeast, malt, spices and even some port or wine characteristics.  At one point I got a hint of orange zest as well.  The flavor was chocolate, thin red wine, malt and spice.  Tight carbonation provides a silky mouthfeel and the finish is nice.  A dynamic aroma.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","Soonah"
2858,"2008-02-09",4.5,"In a 33cl bottle, served in a tulip glass.  Pours with little or no head and the hint of a lace ring around the glass.  If you can find a bright enough light it is a deep ruby although perhaps not entirely clear.  The nose is very inviting, no hint of alcohol, just a warm caramel and raisin invitation to take the plunge.

The initial sip was as the nose indicated, plus a smooth and thick as silk body, very pleasant feel and taste, a sweet caramel coupled with the hint of raisins.

The finish goes right along with everything else, very pleasant, but no lingering aftertaste, just a desire to pick up the glass and taste again.  A wonderful beer.","Alabama, USA","BrotherBenny"

Dark brown with red highlights, overwhelming, fine-bubbled tan head, great lacing - absolutely beautiful.  Strong fruit and spice aroma:  sweetness from plums and raisins predominant, a slight tinge of light toffee.  Some great clove and licorice complexity.  Taste is much the same, with lingering spice and fruit overlaying an intensely sweet (but not cloying) malt backbone.  Brown sugar and caramel balance clove and nutmeg.  Slightly tannic or winey presence that really takes hold in the Danish version (which I prefer).  Really no alcohol presence whatsoever.  Nicely thick mouthfeel despite a good deal of very fine but very fierce carbonation.  Great, great beer both objectively and just as a testament to some very unique, wonderful brewing from Struise.","Ithaca, New York, USA","dmradus"

L: Lusciously deep dark woody brown with a robust tan head of tight creamy foam that leaves behind a good deal of curtain-like lace, an appealing start.

S: Clove licorice, figs, prunes, raisins, over ripened dark cherries, dark candied sugars, coconut shavings, herbs and spices, a rich and complex nose that is full of delectable scents.

F&T: Alcoholic, but malt chewy, firm carbonation gives the moderate body a nice creaminess.

The pour was then dark brown with much less head than I expected after the bubbling over, but with lots of small bubbles nonetheless. Typical dark Belgian strong ale look. Anyway. Aroma was very Belgium. Definitely some raisin, but also some lighter fruits, banana, lemon, pear amidst the hearty Belgian yeast and malt. Some background but still feisty spices played about as well, and of course there was some alcohol. Flavor was very zesty. An odd word, but I found a certain spicy lemon zest to again work its way to the forefront amidst the more typical heavier flavors in such a brew. Very well rounded and complex. Mouthfeel had a certain creaminess often not found in the Belgians accompanying some alcohol-strong carbonation. Excellent.

Ive been hoarding this bottle for a while, ever since discovering how marvelous the mere Pannepøt is. Tonight is the right time to open it up. The beer pours thick black with a huge frothy tan head.

The aroma is complex but not overpoweringly rich: the basic tones are quad-like dried plums and raisins, mild spices, damp earth, a subtle overlay of unsweetened chocolate. I close my eyes and breath in the more subtle tones, and Im following the smell of an active kitchen far-off down the end of a slightly damp stone tunnel underneath the old city. 

Enough dreaming. I open my eyes, remove my nose from the tulip, and take a si....Oh--my--goodness. An unparalleled explosion of flavor. Dark raisin liquor and rich spices carom off my taste buds and splash across my mouth. Sweet oatmeal-raisin cookies rush to the front, laden with cinnamon, and savory bread dipped in oil and vinaigrette. Blackberry juice sloshes against the gentlest of smoked peats. A subtle hint of fresh mint leaves slithers between the strong dark sugars. The beer is incredibly thick on the tongue but never unpleasantly so, the flavor bursting out in all directions from that rich liquid, creamy in its mouthfeel, hot only in the slightest on the back of the throat if I savor the sip too long in my mouth.

Absolutely fabulous beer. I believe I just gave it a 4.6, which makes it my #3 beer. Such rank is well deserved. 

2006 Bottle March 08: a gusher. Interesting. 
2006 Bottle April 08: Another gusher, maybe a bit more mild this time. Doesnt hurt the flavor one bit. Absolutely divine.

2006 Bottle Dec 10.Stunning, absolutely stunning. Maybe even 4.7. Im back on beer again.

2006 bottle Nov 23, 2013.A long way from the gusher of five years ago, opens with barely a puff and pours almost without head and with minimal remaining carbonation. Sweet, spices and raisins forward, the age is starting to show and this one is probably past its peak.
2006 bottle Oct 12, 2016.My last remaining bottle? After the bottle three years ago, I didnt have particular high expectations. But wow -- this is absolutely amazing. Served at about 60 degrees in a St. Bernardus goblet. So rich, lots of chocolate with no coffee or ash, some red wine, plenty of spice, relatively sweet, so creamy. Wow, absolutely amazing at 10 years in. This is a 4.6 beer through and through.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2858,"2008-01-01",4.4,"330 ml. bottle.  Dark brown color, turbid and opaque with a moderate tan head. Dark fruits and spices in the aroma, raisin, ripe fig, nutmeg and allspice, like rum soaked spice cake, floral, herbal and dark berry notes add an interesting complexity, along with a bit of smoke.  Flavor is wow, complex, with lots of dark fruits, rich yeasts, coffee and molasses, a bit of tart blackberry, warming alcohol and spices.  Smooth, full body and soft, gentle carbonation.","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"
2858,"2008-01-01",4.1,"2006 vintage.
The aroma was malty and toasty with a nutty caramel characteristic. Deep dark fruits of raisins, plums and currents filled the nasal passages. Lurking behind was a candylike aroma and a light bit of spice.
The beer poured into the glass crystal clear until a chunk of yeasty beasties dislodged and caused a haze. The color was amber brown and the head was beige and low, yet lasting enough to lace the glass. The flavor was deeply malty and smooth with a very slight bit of tart acidity in the finish. The flavor contained more of the dark fruits, but they were not as well defined in the flavor as in the aroma and were somewhat muted. The candy flavor was present, but it was not sweet. The flavor was toasty and nutty and had a bit of spicy hop bittering which was strong enough to keep the malts in check and to allow the beer to finish dry.  In the finish the beer had some lasting dark fruity and light pepper spice in the aftertaste. The body was full and thick on the palate. The carbonation was fairly low. Alcohol had a small role in the aroma, no appearance in the flavor, and substantial presence in the warming which occurred post consumption. An interesting and tasty beverage indeed!

2858,"2007-12-25",4.6,"33cl bottle.  Gift from Aaron @ the Trappist.   2006 vintage.  Thanks to Nixter for sharing.   We left it in the sun all day yesterday, put it in a brown paper bag this morning, pried the cap off with a cigarette lighter and passed the bottle back and forth while riding BART down to San Leandro.. Just kidding.  Cracked @ 55F on the morning of 12/25/2007.  No glass recommendation on the label, so I used a small wine glass.  Opaque pour with small, thin head.  You have to pour this one aggressively if you want big head retention, but thats not really necessary.  A fountain of complexity.  First few sips give dried fruit, raisins, prunes, and especially plum.  Next few sips chocolate starts to appear in the finish.  Get even deeper in and you can start tasting the noble hops in the middle of your palate (Hallertau MF/Mt. Hood?).  Big body but not too dry, not too sweet. Very smooth finish, the alcohol is not hot or harsh in any way, it contributes significantly to the mouthfeel.    This beer is awesome.  Many compare this to Westvletern 12, someday I will do a side by side to decide for myself.  Try some and I dont think youll be disappointed.","Oakland, California, USA","nahthan"
2858,"2007-12-23",4.3,"Pours an almost black plum color with 2 fingers of dark creamy head that dies slowly to a collar and leaves a dissapating sheet of lace with every sip. Smells of plum, fig, vanilla, spice and slight clove. Awesome nose. Taste is very complex and reminds me of a Westy 12. Lots of fruit, fig, pear, a little vanilla and a smooth finish. Chewy in the mouth with the tickle from carbonation. Awesome drinkability. Blindfold me and let me taste this and I would guess its a trappist delight.","Columbus, Maryland, USA","franksnbeans"

Pours a deep brown color with a nice beige head that left good lacing.  Also present were the nice, streaming ""belgian"" bubbles.  Yeasty aroma with fruity esters, mostly banana and orange.  Tart, fruity entry moves into a spicey yeast middle with even more fruit flavors, and finishes slightly tart with a hint of alcohol.  The yeast creates a crisp and lively palate.

2858,"2007-12-04",4.7,"In my mind, this is tied with Westy 12 for my favorite quad. Im heading to Belgium in two weeks and I will definitely do a side by side tasting to determine the winner.

A: This is a great looking beer. The perfect amount of mocha colored head topping a very dark brown body. There was some yeast that found its way into the second glass, but the first one was very clear. The head retention is amazing.

S: There are a bunch of aromas emanating from the glass including raisins, prunes, cherries, malt, alcohol, yeasty esters. It is a very inviting aroma and everything is blended nicely.

T: This beer is crazy smooth. It tastes like someone got a blender and threw in raisins, chocolate, dark sugars, prunes and just a touch of alcohol and pressed puree. I cant taste barely any of the 10% alcohol that is in it.

M: Very smooth with low carbonation fits nicely with its medium/heavy body. It has a thick feel, but somehow isnt really a heavy body.

2858,"2007-11-24",3.4,"11.2 oz bottle, dated 2006. Pours a dark brown with a huge fizzy light tan head that retains well and laces the glass. This is darker and has more carbonation than the Danish version.

The aroma is very subdued. Light chocolate malts and a little dark fruit, leather and alcohol.

The flavor is smooth rich chocolate malts and some dark fruit with some alcohol and enough bitterness to balance it and give it a dry finish. Some spices come out as it warms.  The mouthfeel is medium with sparkly carbonation.

Overall, a nice dessert beer. I think I prefer the Danish version slightly - its a little more complex. I do like the decadent flavors of this version a little more though even though they are not as complex. The aroma in this one was not very present compared to the Danish. And this one is thinner. While both are dessert type beers, they are quite a bit different.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"
2858,"2007-11-18",4.0,"Bottle, 2006 version, for the BIG 100 (not to mention #500 for this beer)!!  It only took me about a year and a half, but I finally made it.

Pours dark brown with a monstrous off-white head.  A bit darker than the Danish variety, and exactly the opposite in the head department.  Aroma was big on the malts; caramel and dark fruits.  I also thought I caught a bit of smoke in there; was not expecting that.  Taste was very sweet as well, caramel and raisins as the major players.  I didnt pick up as much spice as the other version.  Sticky mouthfeel with a fruity, sweet finish.

Pannepot pours black with absolutely zero light shining through my goblet. A two finger dense tan head formed on the pour and as it fell became craggy. The body and head of this beer are very stout-like. The head does not go anywhere and leaves big patchy lacing as the glass empties. Great looking beer.

Unbelievable aromas are coming from my glass. Really reminiscent of holiday fruits. Spiced apple cider (as in clove, cinammon, nutmeg, and of course apples) Juicy plums and dripping ripe pears. This has one of the most vivid dark fruit aromas Ive yet to come across. Theres a slight mustiness hidden way in the back with very mild cocoa and cream. This is a beer just stacked with layer upon layer of complexity.

Im almost afraid to drink this beer cause after the aroma it can only be a step down. Actually the flavor is just about as good as the aroma which is incredible. There are some differences though. The fruits are still very much present but without as much spicing as in the aroma. There is more cocoa and cream in the flavor though. Mustiness on the backend with a touch of bitterness on the swallow. Alcohol adds a nice spiciness on the swallow. My despription cant even begin to describe the complexities of this ale.

Full body with an ultra creamy mouthfeel as it hits the tongue. the carbonation froths this one up mid palate and gives it a very welcomed airy quality. Unbelievably creay and smooth.

I know this is a high abv beer and usually big complex dark Belgians Im satisfied with one glass. This I find myself wanting more and more. Great drinkability for such a huge beer.

Im sure if you read this far in my review you can tell Im crazy about Pannepot. It is a beer I will seek out again and again. One I will never tire of and, hopefully, always have some in the cellar or fridge.

Wonderful aroma, and rather mellow too.  Chocolate, nutty, and gingerbread flavor, followed by licorice, raspberries, spicy yeast notes (cant really decipher that),  and finishes with a warming yeasty flavor.  Some deep dark fruit tastes and more licorice on the finish also.  Aftertaste evolves unexpectedly into a real nutty earthy hop flavor followed by cappuccino.  Awesome.

Served in a Delirium Tremens tulip.  Pours a dark opaque brown with a initially large tan head.  The head fades to just a little layer, but it lasts.

The initial flavor I pick up is clove.  Coco, toffee, pepper, and cooked sugars with a touch of alcohol.  Slight bitterness in the finish.

First off I have to preface this by saying that Quads are not exactly my thing and I havent had a lot of experience with them. That being said... 

My friend tasting it with me says it looks like coca-cola, and I have to agree. Nose is totally odd and unique and extremely complex. At first I thought it smelled like old, concentrated cotton candy. Then my friend pointed out that she thought it had a fragrance like banana Laffy Taffy (which it certainly does). There is just a load of things going on with this nose. Flavor is spice forward. Very sugary sweet like brown sugar and a slight biting alcohol presence. After a swallow and it settles on my tongue I get a heavy coffee aftertaste. The feel has a coffee flair to it as well. Like old coffee that was brewed with five times too many grinds. Extremely drinkable. But this puppy is heavy of course and I bet after some time in the cellar, it would even out and be even better. Highly suggested.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","RblWthACoz"

2858,"2007-09-05",2.9,"This might be a great beer but for me it was a very strange brew.

2858,"2007-09-04",4.7,"My wife brought me home a bottle of this unexpectingly, and now its become a staple in our house.  Be careful with these, because if you pop one thats room temperature, the carbonation will literally spray.  Im usually not a big belgian drinker, but this stuff is gold.  Gorgeous dark brown color with a fizzy, highly carbonated look.  The head is thick and and chewy, but disolves quickly.  Sweet smell, fruity, raisiny, molasses-esque.  Very complex without taking a sip yet.  Upon that sip, very VERY complex.  Sweet but not overbearing with a good warm kick at 10%.  The high abv is noticeable, but not in a bad way.  Very soft and complex, and easily drinkable.  I could go through quite a few of these, but they arent that cheap either.  HIGHLY recommended!!!","Waldo, Ohio, USA","danglefruit"
2858,"2007-09-02",4.3,"Upon opening, it gushed from the bottle, and poured very fizzily into the glass, producing a large brown head that faded somewhat quickly. Dark brown in color, and it left a heavy lacing. Aroma was deep chocolate with fruitiness wafting in and out, notes of raisins, plums, something vaguely tropical, and perhaps a lactic component that troubled me in conjunction with the gushing. Initial flavor did seem to possess a mild tartness, but it eventually seemed to give way in favor of a rich slightly roasted chocolatiness, sweet molasses and brown sugar, with dark rummy alcoholic like tingles, and gentle fruitiness of perhaps banana and raisin. Theres a spiciness here that I cant identify, it comes across as a general yeastiness. Soft mouthfeel, it doesnt hide its alcohol strength but doesnt beat you with it either. One of the most complex beers Ive had in too long a time.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

Seconds after the bottle opener broke the seal, I was rewarded with a veritable fountain of foam, which kept going for a frighteningly long time.  Once I finally managed to get the cap off fully, the pour was mahogany with a big brown head that subsided reasonably quickly.  Lots of alcohol and malt on the nose, along with dark fruits like plums, cherries, and raspberries.  Definitely some liquorice in there as well.  Each sip coats the mouth, bringing flavors of cherries and berries, anice and cloves.  Theres some roast flavor in there, but its countered by lots of caramel-candy sweetness.  The alcohol I could smell might as well not actually be there, as its hidden completely by the huge, swirling flavors of fruit, spices and malt.     I think the flavor is definitely similar to that of Dogfish Heads worldwide stout, or vice versa if you please.  It could stand to be slightly less sweet, but this is still a wonderful, wonderful brew.  If it werent so expensive, Id definitely get more.","State College, Pennsylvania, USA","RolandTower"

Flavor is wonderfully full and complex, starting a little bit nondescriptly and then crescendo-ing into a dark fruit, dried dates and candi sugar sweetened middle phase before leaving a warm alcohol rich aftertaste.  Spices whirl around in the mix... nutmeg, cloves and something like ginger all surface at various times.

It took a good 10 minutes for it to settle to a manageable level.  The huge head leaves behind a slippery, sudsy lacing that slowly creeps and crawls its way down the glass.  The aroma shows candy sugar, rum soaked figs, dark cherries, fruity esters, and clove.  There is also a bit of funky, sour yeast, though it melds well with the sweeter fruity smells.  The flavor is really fantastic.  It shows candy sugar and dark fruits up front, with some nutmeg and clove, as well as root beer and hints of cream soda.  Again, the funky yeast slips in towards the end and leaves a slight tickle in the back of the throat.  The beer has a medium-full mouthfeel, and a creamy, smooth texture.

Aroma is sweet and rich; malty with figs/dark fruits, banana, peat and some spice - maybe nutmeg - and a touch of chocolate.  Flavor profile is similar and dominated by sweet dark candied fruits with some spice and sour yeastiness.  Finishes nicely dry.  Swirling out some of the fizz helps moderate a high carbonation that I felt interfered somewhat.  Otherwise, mouthfeel is medium and quite smooth.  Nice alcohol warmth, but otherwise not really noticeable.  A nicely done beer, but didnt blow me away as much as I had anticipated and hoped.

2858,"2007-08-13",5.0,"TRUMP! Ok, now were talkin. That Danish version doesnt hold a candle to this one. First off the color is mahogany brownish and totally opaque. A huge plume of froth is forthcoming and it just sits there like a well trained dog. As the froth reduces it leaves behind a sticky, clumpy lace w/ a full canopy. Perfection. This is what Im talking about. The aroma is so much more aromatic. I can smell the sweet malts but also the carrot cake spice, Angostura bitters, and dusty Belgian granite. Full viscous nectar w/ ample residual effers that expand on impact creating a cottonous creamy texture. Upfront the brew is direct and to the point. A huge malty backbone supports an abundance of mildy sweet caramel, gingerbread, clove, licorice, mint, cocoa, cola, herbs, and holiday cheer. An abundance of spice is not offensive at all. Theres and defined bittering that balances all this out and leaves a snappy parchment on the palate. The finish is long and mildy sweet w/ the same spice kick in the ass but the bittering is what sets this one apart. The palate is left dry and ready to go on. This is a brew worthy of its attention.

Not at all sweet in my opinion. Has some cabernet characteristics to it. Outstanding.","Moline, Illinois, USA","mtdshn"

2858,"2007-08-11",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2008 2006 bottle. This poured a very deep mahogany color with a huge frothy tan head that is very well retained. The head seemed neverending and left its lacing all the down the glass as it diminished slowly. The aroma is so complex that is hard to pick out all the flavors. Sweet dark fruits, berries, caramel, sweet malts, and chocolate come to mind. The flavor is very sweet as well with caramel, dark fruits, chocolate and vanilla all swirling around. The alcohol hides itself nicely in the background as all the flavors just dance on the tongue. Full bodied and creamy all the way through. The spices are left behind with every sip in a subtle way with the sweetness pulling you back for more each time. An awesome beer in every sense of the word. One of the best belgian beers around and certainly lives up to its rating.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

The head on this one is much better than on the Pannepøt.  Aroma of plum, dark fruit, berry, a bit of chocolate and caramel, and spice.  Aroma is sweeter than that of Pannepøt, which is dryer and a bit more dried fruit.  Awesome flavors of sweet caramel malts, brown sugar, complex dark fruit, and a bit of chocolate.

Basically this is obviously the same beer as the Pannepøt  but the flavor are so much more pronounced. Dark berries bigtime, chocolate, carame, candi sugarl and molasses. The carbonation being bigger than the Pannepøt helps so much more, it brings out so much flavor. More belgian spicy yeast is introduced, more chocolate and more berries, well more everything.

Poured out a deep opaque brown, same color as Guinness Stout. It has a massive mocha colored head. Leaves a sticky lace down the sides of the glass. Aromas are of alcohol, spices, strong malts, slightly yeasty too.
Flavors are of spiced rum, fruitcake, coffee, dark dried fruits. Rich mouthfeel, almost chewy. Alcoholic burn when swallowed. Needs some serious aging. Finished slightly sweet & very warming. Good beer overall.","","Cobra"

7/12/2007:  The first time that I had Struise Pannepot was after Dark Lord Day 2007 during the tasting that evening at the hotel.  I remember it being light brown in color, somewhat fruity, and very spicy.  I didnt like it very much.  However, this time the experiece was completely different and so much better...  Struise Pannepot pours a very dark brown color with a diminishing foamy brown head.  The aroma is caramelized malt, a hint of Belgian fruitiness and banana, and some smoke.  The sweet, malty flavor also has some dark fruits, spice and smoke.  There is some alcohol and char in the finish as well.  It feels thick and vineous on the palate.  This beer is so complex that it really must be opened and enjoyed on its own and not during a tasting.  This is one of those beers that is just wonderful and packed full of so many unique flavors and meld together for create and excellent beer.  I cant wait to have this again.  Next time I will do a side-by-side tasting between the regular Pannepot (this one) and the Danish version (Pannepøt)...

12/04/2008:  Pannepot looks murky.  It is brown in color with a small ivory-colored collar.  It has a Merlot/Shiraz-like aroma with some creamy tanins coming out.  This beer tastes like weak port, sweet grapes, and has lots of caramel and a dry finish.  It has a medium-full body with a smooth, mellow, and creamy texture.

Not very beer-like, this is overly rich and more like brandy.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mabel"
2858,"2007-07-31",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2008 The beer pours with a huge head that never quite dissipates.  A vinous, caramel aroma gives way to a deep complex beer.  And that is not even the start!  When slightly cool the beer has a sweet, spicy taste that is good, but nothing spectacular, but as Pannepot warms up the beer opens up into a vinous, sweet and almost pumpkin-pie spiced ale.  Very interesting beer that is sweet enough to be cloying, but is never sticky.  The finish is very, very slightly bitter, which I would attribute to something like a stale hop addition.  The beer is a little bready and sweet in a Belgian way, but very decent.  A good beer.  Apple PIE!!!! Yummy shit.","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"
2858,"2007-07-31",4.7,"Ultra dense brownish mahagony, thick rocky light tan head.  The lacing was stuck to the glass from first sip to last drop.  Decadent complex nose of black cherries sprinkled with cinnamon, fig, dried plum, toasted brown sugar, and touches of prune.  Opened into further soft musty caramel and vinous-like tones as it warmed to room temperature.  Rich yet lightly spiced dark pitted fruit flavors balance to perfection over warm bready caramel  and faint Añejo rum notes.  Dark sweet malt gets a quick parting shot of aged hops to keep the sweetness partially subdued.  Full bodied, heavy and smooth, with medium carbonation throughout.  This truly blew me away!  Just an incredible beer....","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"

Scents of yeast and mild coffee. Sweet-flavored; a very delicate malt-sweetness along with caramel and a complex fruitiness, (like an English fruitcake) with a nutty, sweet bready and rummy character.

2858,"2007-07-27",4.3,"Rating #200. Last bottle (2006) from Corral Liquors in Granite City, IL. Thanks Joe! This one was a gusher. Ill eventually learn to open Belgians over the glass/sink. Pours a dark brown with just a hint of deep red highlights at the edges and a creamy, tan head that diminishes to a small cap. Dark roasted malts, toffee, and dark fruits with a light alcohol note in the background. Full-bodied, oily and somewhat sticky, thousands of tiny bubbles tickle your tongue as you swallow to a fairly ""warm"" finish. Syrupy sweet dark malts and plum with chocolate and light alcohol at the finish. Lightly dry and tannic in the aftertaste much like dark chocolate paired with a dry red wine. This is a very nice beer and definitely deserving of its reputation.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

2858,"2007-07-25",4.7,"2006 bottle from State Line.  Rich aroma of cherry, sour and sweet with spicy yeast and notes of caramel and raisin and faint vanilla.  Bit of a light gusher, mahogany pour, noisy and nearly opaque ruby under light, with a light brown soapy head.  Superbly malty taste, notes of rum, raisin, vanilla, cherry, and even smoke!  Hearty and warming, full-bodied with a dry, smoky aftertaste that lingers.  Velvety smooth mouthfeel.  Sweet and spicy, only the faintest hint of sourness, with no bitterness.  Dates, cream, and a touch of molasses with the memory of Belgian chocolate.  A little spicy fruitcake: a rooty sort of spiciness, but blended to the point it is unidentifiable; finish wants to add notes of bourbon but veers off toward port instead.  Rounded, fruity, balanced, with well-integrated alcohol; theres a ton going on here.  This is pretty much everything Im looking for in a beer - what a complex beast!","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Dark brow colored ale with a tan head that fizzes like a soda and goes away quickly. Incredibly complex aroma produces notes of caramel, chocolate, plum, fresh roasted coffee, and fresh tobacco. The taste is stellar as well. Molasses, brown sugar, more plum, chocolate, awesome sauce, clove, and almost everything that I love about freedom can be found in the flavor.

2858,"2007-07-18",4.5,"Dark brown color with a strong medium tan head - a perfect combination.  A thin tan layer remains that adds to the experience.  The aroma is slightly alcoholic with subdued sweet malt that is reminiscent of dried apricots.   Flavor does not disappoint, with caramel, brown sugar, candied ginger, and multidimensional malts.  The sweetness continues into the finish, although the high degree of carbonation and slight bitterness balance it nicely.  Each taste only increases my opinion of this superlative beer that reminds me of the Westvleteren 12.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","DMRz"

Amazing retention. As the last drops fell onto the head they sort of floated on top then blended in.  Aroma and flavor is candied malts, rich ripened fruits and spices. As it warms the fruits seem to come out a little more. Also hints of licorice and molasses. It is a meal in itself. Overall it is an outstanding ale. The appearance was the biggest treat though.

2858,"2007-07-18",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 6, 2016 Big amber/brown head on top of a dark brown lucious,  liquid.  This beer stands out on all fronts...label design, pour, aroma, taste.  Memorable for all the reasons mentioned thus far, truly a world class beer.  Like a Rochefort or Westvleteren, the flavors cross many spectrums, the range of depth includes deep sweet tropical fruits, molassas, brown sugar, honey, necktar of the gods,  and rich malts ranging from sour to powder sugar sweet.

After the head died down it formed a magnificent tan infinitetessmally small bubble cream 2mm thick layer on the surface that never fades.  The head forms a spectacular milky wall on the surface of the glass as I swirl it. At a glance could I fool you into thinking this was a Westy 12. The flavors and alchohol nose start off a little harsh, but then quickly mellow as the liquid warms.  The mild aroma of malt, maybe a bit of fig or anise.  The thick bodied beer has nice slight sweetness, and medium notes of licorish on the finish.  Is this the spice they are referring to?  I cant find any other, than maybe fig.  Wonderful.

Has the body of a barleywine, but the complexities of a belgian abby ale. Crazy mixed up fruits and spices never can outshine the big malty sweetness that this musters up.

When it got to him I tricked him into me getting the first sip.  Really damn good, I almost stole the bottle and ran off.

As creamy and rich as it appears with fluffy, but restrained, carb.  Caramel mocha latte and candied orange peel with vinous alcohol.  Dry oaky finish with lightly bitter cloves.

The head is dense, thick and khaki colored and never drops below 2-finger height; laces a lot also. Has a rich aroma. Sweet, candyish and fruity of chocolate-covered banana, dates, toffee, subtle citrusy alcohol, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg. The flavor is sweet and rich. Has a slight burn on the throat, which maybe remedied through time. Lively mouth feel with dense carbonation. Initial flavors are maple soaked fruits, ripe banana, plum, fig, cinnamon/chocolate, with lots of caramel as well. Then the spices come out with evident allspice, brown sugar, and a late clove suggestion. The finish is surprisingly roasty and almost coffee like. A very nice & rich Ale that may gain with time.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

Its all about the spiced, vinous quality here. Suggestions of prunes, white wine, a little beef are here.

Some apples, cherries, peaches, molasses, plums, subtle chocolate. Not detecting any hops. Carbonation is very high giving a prickly cola-like mouthfeel. Body is medium. 10% abv is hidden very well.

2858,"2007-04-13",4.5,"Bottle. 2006. High alcohol Belgian candi sugar aroma. Chocolate, caramel, raspberry, molasses. Huge head. So huge in fact that I had to get a second glass because it was going to take 10-15 minutes before the head dissipated enough for me to sample it. The first glass I poured about 2/3 full and then watched it  slowly rise, rise, rise to almost overflowing and then it overflowed a bit. If ever a beer was bottle conditioned, this would be it. Opaque body with frothy head that basically doesnt diminish. Leaves scattered, frothy lace; actually more like residue. Very sweet. Highly carbonated. Alcohol is not overly harsh, though quite noticeable. This is a dessert beer. Could probably be poured over ice cream, though that would make for a fairly expensive treat. Has a sweet hop thing going on in the finish that is tough to beat. Whatever that is, its what makes the difference between this being a good beer and being a great beer, which it is. Its perhaps a little sweet for me and initially a little overly carbonated, but the spritz tends to die down after awhile. Excellent.

App.:  Very dark brown with red hues, huge tan head, hard to tell if its clear or not...
  
Aroma:  Mint, licorice, vanilla, rootbeer;  lots of molasses, toffee, treacle; chocolate, yeast funk; herbal, floral in a way; a little alcohol; a touch of wood, lighter roasted coffee, hints of spicy mincemeat (ginger, warm spices, dried fruit).
  
Palate:  Very full body, velvety and chewy, very soft carbonation and powdery.
  
Flav.:  True to the nose; very sweet, but not really cloying  offset by bitterness; more dark-roasted malts on finish, and warming alcohol.  Coats the mouth and lingers a while with maybe a hint of tartness and smoke..

2858,"2007-04-09",4.4,"Bottle from Degarth. Finally getting to try this one. Im glad Ive waited, though, as I feel I wouldnt have been able to appreciate this earlier on, back when I gave Stille Nacht a 3.2. Certainly this is a sweet beer, but the complexity and character in the sweetness is beautiful. Like maple syrup in grandeur, yet as refined as a fine port.

Pours with an awfully fizzy head, very cola like and really the only disappointing aspect of this beer. The aroma is deep and reclusive, playing the cello to the orchestra of beers, deep and rich, yet hardly noticed amongst the violin double IPAs and booming bass drum stouts. Plum, honey, cinnamon and chives, to name but a few. The list could go on for ages. 

The depth of its sweetness really comes in to play in the flavor, which is a touch harsh when first opened though quickly breathes into its own delicacy. If this beer were a character, Id call it winnie the pooh. Big and fluffy, honey loving, a bear yet gentle and playful, the sweetness glides across the tongue and highlights every sugar imaginable: maple, molasses, honey, sucrose, brown sugar, dried fruits: the list goes on and on. Utterly fantastic and utterly refined, this beer no doubt deserves its place amongst the worlds best.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

An absolutely gorgeous brew.  The aroma is very heavy with loads of spicy coriander, bittersweet chocolate, red grapes, dark plums, prunes and some other sweet fruity notes that I cant quite put my finger on.  Sweet berries, blackberries, and raspberries all hiding behind a soft gingery flavour.  The palate is completely silken with a creamy, wheaty texture.  Flavour is a combination of heavy fudge, dark chocolate, sweet berries, some herbal hops and a touch of mint as well.  Lots of yeasty complexity throughout, with strong spice and a figgy/rummy sweetness throughout.  A bit of oaky/vanilla character as well.  Despite the sweetness, there is a bit of late tartness that helps accentuate the fruity flavours and keeps the brew from becoming cloying.  Warming also intensifies the raspberry/chocolate flavours.  An absolutely amazing beer.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

Im abruptly worried, as I wasnt expecting, well, a Thanksgiving brew.  Flavor again surprises, with rich malts dominating the scene, caramel with a touch of chocolate.  The spice however comes in strong at the finish, quite similar to the nose, but with a hint of baked cherry.  The spice stops just short of being cloying.  All in all, a really unique beer unlike anything Ive had before.  Perhaps not the first thing I would reach for, but definitely interesting.  Now, on to 2000!","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

2858,"2007-04-02",3.9,"Thanks to egajdzis for breaking this out to do a side-by-side tasting...
Appears a dark brown with a dark beige head that slowly fades out into a mild cap.
Smell is of anise up front, vanilla beans, cumin, basil, oregano notes, pine...overly spiced IMO.  The saving grace is the mineral quality that comes from the water source.  It seems similar to Westy with those minerals in mind.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with the spices coming through to compliment the sugary base.  Unfortunately, the spices seem to win out.
Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, smooth, with spices clinging to the palate.

This one was knocked out by the Denmark version, Pannepøt, which didnt have the over abundance of spice present.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"

One of the most drinkable beers there is. I like the 2005 better then the early vintages which I found to sweet (I remember that I didnt finish my first Pannepot). I still find it a very little to sweet.","Aarhus, DENMARK","henrikb"

2858,"2007-03-08",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2013 2006. Gushing. But it pushes forth a phenomenal aroma of incredible unique character. Theres a flow of steady north african spices, exotic asian fruits and nips of candied pipe tobacco smoke. A totally unique aroma, like nothing Ive breathed before. Musky, yeasty, spicy rich and bold, with creamy black tea notes, faint black cardamom and rich swirls of smoked malt breadiness. Phenomenal. The perfect intensity, allowing all nuances of the aroma to expressive individually, before melding into a one perfumy bliss. Heat nor yeast nor hops dominate aroma. Pours an intimidating deep dark near black mahogany, with a sticky head of tea and milk foam. In the corner a cut of garnet, glowing strongly. On the tongue, a whole new array of flavors and complexity. This is ridiculous. First I grab a real bright passionfruit bubblegum yeast soap, which is actually this beers weakest point, but then it yields to a growing warmth in calvados and pear brandies. The residual sweetness slides into a terrific wallop of deep caramels and emaciated raisins, with a toothy bread climbing out of a pot of honey. Intense chewiness with a real backbone. Beer slides off the tongue gracefully, kissing the roof of the mouth with a refined hazlenut and almond bite. A wisp of danish pipe tobacco curls up through the humors. Spices provide a nice base and accentuate the yeast and malt characters. Hopping appears briefly as a sweet lemon rind note in the smack. There are some fantastic sweet fresh maple syrup notes and freshly cut tobacco wood touches that briefly alight out the backdoor. Somehow a little harsh to my nostils and tongue, and the sticky malt notes grow slightly cloying. But to experience such astounding new flavors and nuances, this beer is fantastic. I love the airy quality of quaffablity that comes from the yeast attenuation. Expertly crafted and above all others. The best part is that I keep finding new things in the beers as my palate adapts, now a growing sense of ground fresh ginger root and gentle alder smoke. One of the most intricate beers.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

How: Bottle 330ml, vintage 2006.  Compared side-by-side with Pannepot Grand Reserva
The look: Cloudy dark burgundy topped by a small persistent tan head
In long: Nose is rather spicy, almost smell like a Christmas beer.  Taste is mixes a wide array of fruits and a complex array of spices.  Its fruity character is rather complex with just about everything from red apples, bananas, figs, and the list goes on and on The spicy fruity cake attack paves the way for a nice floral finish.  The spices are particularly well integrated and after only a few sips they became an integral part of the beer instead of a distraction.  Nice earthy notes.  Unlike the Reverva and Grand Reserva the regular Pannepot spiciness brings a nice dryness.  The Reserva is the best of the three but only slightly.  No alcohol presence at all.  Excellent, of course.  But ratebeer top-30?  Cmon, what are you guys on?  Pannepot with extra pot?","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2858,"2007-02-20",4.3,"11.2oz bottle thanks to thebeercellar2: Pours to an opaque dark brown body with a huge, frothy & lasting tan colored head that almost looks as though it has a little bit of red coloring it as well.  The aroma shows an interesting blend of burnt mint leaf, pine bark, roasted clove, mild eucalyptus, but underlying all this is what smells mild, but hints at a strong roasted, caramel, toasted malt base, it even shows hints of coca-cola at times (which to me smells like cinnamon, sweet caramel, syrup, and lightly tart molasses).  The flavors are quite complex and unfold in what seems like three stages.  Initial sip: light pine, sweet sugar cane, caramel, and citrus hops hiding in the background.  Middle, while fully in mouth: roasted pine bark, roasted nuts (almonds?), apple, pear, coke, a brief hit of alcohol, mint, basil?, mild wood or toasted oak.  Finish: vanilla bean, chocolate, bitter cocoa bean, mild coffee-infused wood, and hints of a spice I just cant put my finger on - mint/sage?  pine/eucalyptus?  Medium-full bodied, lively carbonation, and rich.  This is a very complex beer with superb spicing that never overpowers while blending with all the flavors to create a unified, yet diverse, tasting beer.  The one MINOR thing that I dont like is that it is just a little on the sweet side.  The extended aftertaste gives a bit of dried anise and cherry.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

2858,"2007-02-07",4.5,"2006. This is the most beautiful looking Belgian I have ever had, the first beer that made me wish the appearance scale could be adjusted to a higher number for special circumstances. Such a picturesque, statuesque and stately head, boldly bobbing atop a gleaming mahogany body that is hazy and so creamy, seems to be melting rather than diminishing. Rarely have I been so thrilled at the sight of a beer. The aroma is mind boggling in its complexity and stunning array of fragrant nuances. Berries of every variety mingle seemlessly with robust caramel malts and chocolate. Vanilla is intertwined with spicy and earthy ginger and sherry. Miraculous it is not, but its darn close. Flavor is very sweet, with tastes of caramel, more dark fruits, dates, chocolate, hazelnut, port and/or sherry and alcohol coyly hiding in the shadows. Monstrous yet balanced, playful yet so refined. Effortless though it is to partake in, its near impossible to sit down, or even admire from afar. The palate is a touch spicy at times but lovely in its entirety. Finishes sweet and elegant. Masterful to the Nth degree.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
2858,"2007-02-07",3.8,"An exceptional Belgian strong ale displaying a delicate sweet/sour balance. It reminded me a bit of Thorogoods Billy Bs Malted Golden Ale in its intensity of flavours. For my money, it errs on the sweet side, but thats a minor criticism of a fine ale. Brown with a solid head. Not as sweet in the aroma as the Pannepeut - this has sherbet and plenty of sour cherries. Perfect palate - soft and creamy. Lots of caramelised sugars, tokay and dried fruits. Terrific stuff but just a bit too sweet IMO. (Bottle courtesy of Duff at the Sydney RateBeer Jan 07 gathering - thanks amigo)","Blue Mountains, AUSTRALIA","highlandlad"
2858,"2007-02-05",3.3,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2008 Competently brewed. Brown, possible red-brown beer, meduim carbonation. Brown sugar present. Too sweet for my tastes but typical for the more commercial Belgian barley wine brands. The label lists other flavours to be discovered, but unlike other reviewers, I couldnt find them. Looking at the five reviews below this, and the aromas and flavours found in them, I had to laugh at the power of suggestion.","Zillebeke, BELGIUM","Hugh"

Flavor is quite confusing but approachable, and strange in a favorable way.  Elements are bitter chocolate, soy sauce, red bell pepper and malty brown sugar.  Whispers of amaretto and smoke put the finishing touches on this very heady concoction, defying descriptions.  Warming with a searing intensity, yet comfortingly rich and smooth.  To be sure I certainly wouldnt recommend this a ""fishermans ale"" - it strikes me as more appropriate for less docile or predictable adventures.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

This fortifying ale lives up to its reputation and puts to shame most other attempts at the style. Almost opaque black under a tan head. Aromas of cola spiced with licquirice and medicinal herbs start to warm the blood.

It almost smells like a Christmas ale in the making!  Insanely complex taste... Its got some sweet malt rounded out with a mild yet very obvious spice.  Im not sure Id stick with my cloves statement, but think wintery spices, not corriander and ""typical"" Belgian spices.  Cardamom?  Some yeast, but not overpowering.

Am thrilled, however, to have given this a shot, totally knocked me out with amazement. The pour was deep dark chocolate brown, no light passing through, no burgundy, yet not black. The head was whomping large, tan to chocolate in color, pillowy, fluffy all over everywhere, darned hard to get in the glass, rings of lacing left all over the place, a pretty site. The aroma was incredibly complex, interesting melding of almost orval like aromas (yet this is dark!!!), grapes, coriander, cinammon, other spices, grapes, light floral and rose petals, apples, just wonderful. Left wondering, why so dark, where are the dark fruits and chocolate? Well, the flavor takes flight with rich dark fruits, chocolate, nuts, citrus tones underneath (some oranges), all with a background of grapes, apples, spicing, and floral character. A touch too sweet (although within this style you tolerate sweet) to be perfect, yet just delightful, and complex enough to be anything but cloyingly sweet. Where is the 10% alcohol, man this is smooth and quiet. The mouthfeel had a touch too much of a sticky feel, but man, this was incredible otherwise. One of the best new beer experiences Ive had in a long while. Outstanding! Re-rate, Feb07, nearly the same experience with a tad more caramel coming out behind it all. Re-rate, Apr07, caramel and some slight metallic or oxidized notes present underneath all of the otherwise beatiful flavors. Will stick with numbers, but either this isnt as good as it was brand spanking new, or I over-rated it a little bit the first time. Heck, maybe the Orval I had before it this time just put all other beers in their proper place?","","User37895"

After an evening of tasting great brews, Andy was kind enought to finish  things off with a bottle of Pannepot. After experiencing a diminishing love affair with Belgian Strong Ales, I am glad that Struise Pannepot was able to bring me right back, more spry than ever. The aroma is ungodly; full of dark fruits and ginger spices, hints of black licorice and caramel malts fill the nose until you cant wait any longer and have to take a sip. The first taste is a beautiful velvety montage of sweet malts, dark spices, and Belgian yeast. This brew definitely takes some time to appreciate its complexity, but doing so will be a rewarding experience.

The Flavour... Almost as enjoying the holy supper in one of the few danish churches serving good port. I get the same sensation of the magnificent taste and the imbibation of something holy. The beer seems so full, that 360 degress wouldnt be enough if it was a circle. The most tiny sip fills your mouth in a way that makes you feel that your jaw will drop and the whole thing will spill down your shirt (or whatever you are wearing...) Intense dried fruit, liqurice, loads of malt and a nice bit of chocolate.
This monster of a taste is caged in a dense and thick liquid, but the carbonation makes it light, easy and highly drinkable like a this kind of beer should be....

2858,"2007-01-05",4.6,"From a 330mL Bottle, 2006 Vintage.  OMG.  This is not what I expected at all.  The aroma grabs ahold of me instantly as I pop the cap, erupting a geyser of tan head out of the bottle neck.  Deep dark, chocolatey brown pour with a massive, gushing head of rich mocha brown.  Impermeable to light, with only a subtle tinge of tobacco red to add some color complexity to the thick, dark body.  Deep, molasses rich gingerbread wafts from the glass, heavy on the ginger spice.  Some milky coconut adds a touch of vanilla lightness, complimenting additional aromas of dark, juicy, spicy, dried figs that tantalize my nostrils.  Sticky, brown sugar coated Virginia whole leaf.  Full bodied, richly carbonated mouthfeel... and the flavor is even more intense than the aroma.  My love affair with dark Belgian strong ales has officially been rekindled after a drought of not tasting anything truly amazing.  Gooey, thick flavors of chocolate fudge and backstrap molasses coat the tounge, spiced with some ginger and a hint of black pepper.  Some soy marinated orange peel and lightly smoked malt supplement wonderfully.  Heavy, brandy-like caramelization - amazing.  Star anise and cinnimon combine in a yeasty spice finish.  Its almost like a hybrid baltic porter, rauchbier, and Belgian strong ale.  So much flavor packed into a 330mL bottle that I instantly feel gluttonous for drinking this one by myself.  Fantastic, thick, decadent dessert.  For me, this beer is to Dark Belgian strong ales what Still Nacht Reserva 2000 is to golden Belgian strong ales.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Pours a hazy orange caramel  with a mountainous beige head in my Duvel glass--didnt even get to pour half the bottle yet--though its probably my fault I let it warm up too much--so its getting a ""4.""  Aroma is full of spices, anise, a bit of wintergreen, scorched caramel malts, powdered sugar, some darker fruits--figs and plums come to mind.  There is also some yeast, alcohol, and some lemon as it warms further.  Anise and roasty malts are the first flavors, along with light wintergreen and lots of sweetness which helps keep the malts from detracting the more subtle flavors.  There is also a pretty strong port quality to this brew.  Bone dry slightly bitter chalky finish, alcohol is noticeable, but nice.  Full bodied and syrupy with some moderate carbonation--Im sure itd have been high had I not let this sit so long.  Not quite what I was expecting--hooray, this did not let me down.

Very unexpected, but very nice, meshing well with notes of plum & fig, rich chocolate, licorice, brown sugar and yeast, leading to a long mocha finish. Totally lives up to all the hype.

2858,"2006-12-02",4.2,"2006 bottle vintage, Sampled November 2006
Rich, fruity notes of sweet prunes emanate from my glass as I pour this brew.  It is topped by an initially two-finger thick head that is frothy in texture, clings to the side of my glass a bit and shows a lightly hazy, purplish, dark brown color.  It is well carbonated with streaming bubbles of CO2 madly making there way up through the beer.  The aroma is heady and sweet with dark fruit notes comprising a major component of the aromatic notes.  Notes of cherries, figs, raisins and prunes, as well as a touch of fruit-like tart notes predominantly comprise the fruit driven aromatics.  A touch of hot alcohol is noticeable as well, it is quite subtle and adds a not  unlike that in a rich brandy.  The alcohol mixes with some other spicy notes that are all quite subtle, but at times remind me of pepper, clove, perhaps a touch of cardamom or even nutmeg and a touch of ginger.  Interestingly enough, as I dig around a bit more into the aroma the sweet cherry component takes on a larger, more prominent role.  There is lots of layered malt character here as well; in addition to the malt driven part of the fruit notes, there are aromas of caramelized, brown sugar encrusted sweet breads and even some notes of molasses.

The first sip leaves me a touch surprised; it is quite a bit drier than I was expecting, based on my reflections of the aroma.  This is sweet though and even lightly tart.  It almost has a tamarind like character to it.  Fruity notes of concentrated sweet / tart plums and plump, lightly caramelized raisins add a softness to this brew that is quite nice.  In fact, while this is quite flavorful (even largely so), this beer is defined by its soft, smooth, mouth coating character that makes is oh so drinkable, yet rich and satiating at the same time.

This beer really is about the balance that it strikes.  The mixture of richness, light sweetness, tart character, lightly spicy hotness, mouth coating richness, yet reasonable quaffability make for a beguiling brew that just begs to be experienced sip after sip.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2858,"2006-11-30",4.2,"Big thanks to Backus for this one!  The aroma is really nice on this beer.  Lots of yeasty characteristics with sour cherries and maybe chocolate or cocoa powder.  The appearance is very dark for a Belgian strong, with a beautiful pillow like fluffy head that last and last.    The mouthfeel is very tingly and carbonated, and the flavors are reminiscent of maybe the rochefort 8 or 10.  I like it alot!  Some dark fruits, chocolates, sour cherries and more.  I would liek the palate to be a little thicker, but it is good at where it is.  And the 10% alc. is no where to be seen.

2858,"2006-11-21",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2008 Rerate 2008. This beer deserves so much better then my initial rating (don’t believe me? let this beer age for a year and a half.) This beer gains so much character over time. I cracked a bottle now 1.5 years old and it was truly beautiful. More complex malt character, hints of cherry and wood, chocolate and almost rum-like chewyness. Like a really well aged Chimay Blue, the spice died down letting layers of malt shine through. Yah, this is how this beer should be. 

2006 Bottle. Nice beer, but this needs to age or something, too sweet and cloying. The flavors are starting to show and will be great when this balances out a bit. Right now heavy licorice flavor shows, kinda cool in the finish. Up front its really woody and brown sugar sweet. Light coffee in the finish with a acidic bite in the end.

Pours a murky brown appearance with a reddish tinge; fluffy off-white head (almost pink?) with great retention and lacing; a beautiful beer.  Aroma shows tart cherry, leather, with hints of barnyard funk and bitter chocolate; boozy nose, almost like a chocolate-covered sour cherry.  Rich, layered mouthfeel: tart cherries upfront, lively carbonation, followed by chocolate and dried fruits.  The finish is crazy, with the sweetness dropping out to reveal a layer of coffee underneath; dry and almost palette-cleansing, like it picks up after itself.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
2858,"2006-11-15",4.7,"Poured dark brown and opaque in my chalice.  A thick head formed right away, I had to slow down my pour for this beauty.  Aroma of sour cherries and chocolate hit me at arms length, maybe some raisin as well.  Upfront the flavor was slightly tart giving way to the chocolate and other flavors.  It is a little hot on the finish but pleasantly so.  This beer has more body than any I have ever had and IMO it is one of the best out there.  I can not wait to try the other  De Struise beers.  On a side note the first time I had this beer was in Belgium over the summer and I thought it was great then.  I my mind it had something to do with the atmosphere.  Now I know that was not the case.

2858,"2006-10-09",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 15, 2010  Rating # 400 2005 Bottle courtesy of MartinT, thank you very much.  Poured into a Chimay glass.  Looks beautiful with a strong creamy, off white color that actually sticks to the glass as the middle settles.  Color is a dark dark brown with no clarity and just a bit of translucence.  Aroma is very present - very nicely sweet bread, strong licorice-y fruitiness, and overall great malt character.  Strong, sweet, tasty and yet balanced and not overwhelming.  Taste is nice but not as impressive  heavy sweetness and creaminess.  Pretty much if bread was turned into a liquid.  I really get a strong presence of taste in my mouth but again nothing that overwhelms.  Oatmeal, cereal, milk as well.  Mouthfeel is nice as well, carbonation is slightly tamed yet present.  A malty-fruit aftertaste left.  Low bitterness.9/5/8/4/19Rerate: 2006 bottle on 9/05/07, this batch made it to the States.  In general the beer is just too young; the flavors have not got a chance to meld well yet.  The head is smaller yet the carbonation feels similar.  Still a very good beer. 8/4/8/4/17
Rerate: 2006 bottle on 11/15/10, so 4 years old.  I pop the cap and the beer is first still but after a moment begins to foam, slowly, op the neck of this 330mL plain, Euro-style, brown bottle.   I pour the beer slowly into a Westvleteren chalice glass.  The head is medium sized and it sits atop the dark brown color body.  The aroma is very prune-molasses alcoholic Belgian syrup.  There is just a hint of cardboard in the back there.   The flavor is similar, its that alcoholic  syrup Belgian sweetness that is pretty yummy.  Its a bit raw at first but when I pour the rest of the beer out, the sooty bottom calms it down and makes it delicious.  Black raisin bread, sweet black biscuit cookie, and other similar descriptors all come to mind.  Still nowhere as good as that first bottle that I tried.  8/4/8/4/17","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

She has been known to wince at beers of 9% or more, merely stating ""God thats strong"", but not this one.  ""mmmm thats nice"" she said ""a real food beer, you want some cheese with that"", but I rate without food so I sat back down and took in the aroma again.  As I said tons going on.

If it wasnt for it being just a little too sweet this would be truely fantastic. Nose has that wonderful aged note that I love so much. The liquorice and candy sugar show clearly throughout.

Dates, black cherry pits and English pipe tobacco interweave with spruce.  It keeps coming - caramelized sugar to a burgundy beat, prunes marinating in a plum brandy sauce... the dark fruited list is endless.  Needless to say, originality has found its spokesperson.  Flavor is admirably divine.  Plums and caramelized dates hit the taste bud receptors and heart strings simultaneously first.  Rum raisins dive into saucy mince meat pie.  Figs bob and weave and plummet into a fishermans bowl of brandied, caramelized raisins.  Consecutive sipping and savoring produces a dark fruited nirvana, pulling on moderately dry tobacco and corresponding cigar wrappers, and melding with rustic black cherry skin, flambéed fig juice and a dainty yet healthy dose of ever-warmed concord sauce spiced with nutmeg and spread over prunes.  Boisterous blackberries interweave with said flavors to create a fairly full-bodied complex.

2858,"2006-08-11",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2008 Pre-Great Taste sampling at 1FastStis house

There were two 2005 vintage bottles of this opened.  I got the bottom of the 
   first one for an extra special yeasty treat.  At some point it would be nice
   to try it again with a better sample simply to see how it compares.  It was
   well made, but at least to me it falls just short of what I would consider a
   Top 50 beer.
Aroma / Appearance - The half-finger tan head lingered over top of a
   midnight brown body.  My pour was a little darker than the others; I think
   I got the dregs of the bottle in mine, causing it to be cloudy and murky.
   The complex nose had hints of fresh honey, caramelized sugar, bittersweet
   bakers chocolate, peppers and cloves.  It balanced well - nothing seemed
   out of place but at the same time I felt it could have been maybe a little
   more dense.
Flavor / Palate - Green apples, cloves, freshly squeezed honey,
   caramel, black cherries and both bittersweet and bakers chocolate.  The
   mouthfeel was well balanced and smooth.  I felt as if it could have possessed
   some more texture.  The finish was a little lacking as well - despite a
   pleasing dry coffee feel I was left wanting more.  If the finish were better,
   this would be borderline Top 50.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Nose is rich, fruity apple notes with some coriander and chocolate, spicey. Body is medium with a surprisingly gentle carbonation, a touch oily. Nice. A blend of fruit flavors, orange, apples, raisins meld nicely with the chocolate and caramel flavors, the spices hanging around. A hint of licorice, bready malts and toffee making themselves known. 10% alcohol is nowhere to be found, amazing! Finish is lightly sweet and fruity. A real treat indeed. Thanks Mike!

2858,"2006-04-15",3.8,"2005 Vintage provided by my main man Mads Berg and served in a Duval Snifter:  Poured a rich mahogany hue topped by a huge fluffy head and excellent lace. The aroma is a interesting combination of crab apple, prune, starfruit, candi sugar, caramelized malt, earthy yeast esters, hint of smoke and wood. Nice and inviting indeed.  The taste is very fruity and very sweet, almost too much sugars left about. Some oaky and ashy subtones added depth before a mild smack of anise and herbal notes. The aftertaste is vanilla, nutty and vinous character. The mouth feel is a tad chalky and underwhelming for all this presented on the palate.  While this is a good beer, I hardly found it Top 50 worthy. The sweetness needs something else to counter and excite the palate more often. I would like the chance to try it again under different conditions.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

2858,"2006-04-06",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2006  Numbers are the consolidation of my thoughts of 04 and 05 vintages.
<P>
04 - Pours heavily carbonated, with aroma that sneaks throughout each bubble.  The spices come first, then the winter aromas of fruit cake and egg nogg appear.  St. Nick would be so lucky to find this awaiting his arrival.  The complexity is astonishing, with nearly every posssible facet being different.  The thick and full palate remind one of its residual sweetness, but the gingerbread  never overtakes the tawny port characteristic.  From start to finish - a masterpiece.<P>
05- An entirely different beer.  Aroma of vanilla and flavor of cherry predominate.  The body seems more thin and the alcohol burn is substantial.  Still an excellent beer, almost to the level and style of St. Bernardus 12.<P>

2858,"2005-11-24",5.0,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2006 Bottle 2004 at Kulminator. After taking some recommendations from other RBers, this was the first beer I ordered here.  And what a drink.  Only my third 5/5.  Dark brown/chestnut colour with thick lasting beige head.  Dark fruits on the aromas, but quite a fresh creamy nose as well.  Beautifully soft in mouth, quite vinuous.  Amazing raspberry, black cherry and creamy fruit flavours.  Finish has some sourness and sweet fruit, both at the same time.  Some dark choc as well.  Wonderful.  This was built up in my expectations to be good and in fact it was even more stunning than I had anticipated.  A brilliant beer.

I find my nose dripping with beer whenever I have Pannepot. But the fun doesn´t stop there! The taste is a fantastic malt and licorice explosion with chocolate undertones, which together with a rather high carbonation, creates a beer unlike any other!

It feels right, though. Sort of sourness from an oud bruin, wine like, sweet stout, brownies, figs & plums and more. In taste, the first that hits you is the sweetness, then a breadlike short period, red wine hits in, caramel, warming alcohol. Hard fudge and caramel in aftertaste.

Rating #810
 Vintage 2004 -- This was one bastard of a pour it took nearly 30min because it was all khaki froth. Once the beer settled, the body sits as a dark walnut almost black hue. The head is resilient and laces every millimeter of glass. This is going to be a rather difficult beer to describe. Ive never encountered aromas and flavors as distinctly unique as these. Suggestions of fruit cake, Raisin Bran and green apple are bold and upfront. Something here, probably the dusty cobwebby green apple presence, reminds me of one of my favorite beers of all time: Beatrix. Boldly abstract malty notes of smoky Canadian maple syrup, molasses, fig and date sugars are straight out of the gate. Spicy milled black pepper and a piquant maduro cigar likeness tons of bold flavors chocolate, cedar wood, pumpernickel bread, clove, anis, leather horse saddle, old burlap, sweetened coffee, tangerine, chocolate mousse but spicy?????? 
 The palate is substantially sticky chewy and sweet. The finish is mildly dry and again reminding me of molasses and toasted pumpernickel bread. This is such an odd yet elegant beer extremely Trappist Ale like with the yeast. Rather astonishing, IMO!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

2858,"2005-08-14",4.2,"(Bottled, 2004 vintage, BBE 07/2007) Very dark brown color with a huge, foamy, lasting, beige head. Big aroma of sweet malt, dried fruit, lots of hops, anise. Very intensely sweet, fruity and malty, chocolatey, barley-port-wineous flavor with a roasty, almost burned, dryish-ashy and bitter finish. Sweetness is a bit less pronounced with the yeast poured in - but still, together with the full body, hides the high ABV completely. Very full-bodied, syrupy-sugary, smooth palate with soft carbonation. Pannepot is like scotch ale, barley wine, trappist, dry stout and sweet port wine, all poured into one. Like tbone_ said, has huge aging potential, but at this age, its way too sweet. Still, when rating a beer this huge and complex, one just cant settle for a score less than 4.

Hazy, dark reddish-brown with a bubbly, yellow-tan cover.  Barleywinish aroma of sweet cereal grains/ pumpernickel with sour banana notes.  The taste is as expected from the aroma and more: sweet, biscuity pumpernickel with a significant amount of hops flavour, yet no bitterness.

2858,"2005-07-12",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2008 2005 vintage bottle sampled on 3/28/08: Aroma has some big light fruity notes and even a touch of acidity and sweet dark Belgian caramel.

Sampled at the RBSG 05 bottle tasting courtesy of Ungstrup: Pours a muddy dark brown with a puffy, but somewhat short-lived, light tan head with clumpy lacing.

Has a huge tan head up top.  Nose is full of oak, sweet spiced dark fruits such as plums, dates, maybe some burnt apricots... amazingly complex beer.  Flavor is centered around some peppery, spicy active yeast with dark plums and black cherries at times... sweet belgian yeast and a molasses character in the finsh.


Rerate 2006 bottle had in 2008.  I just dont think I like the sweetness and sugary candy thing going on in this beer anymore.  Every time I try it I like it less and less and I crave a true Westvleteren, Rochefort or St Bernardus more and more.  I guess this is why my ratings of the Reserva and Grand Reserva are below average.  Im to the point where I like Pannepøt more than Pannepot.  Score lowered from 4.3 to 3.7.

2858,"2005-06-16",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2005 A gift from lachesis, a man as good at brewing as he is generous. Hell, hes bought me beer, given me beer, driven me to train stations, introduced me to people... I could go on. I wasnt going to rate any beers in Europe but this beer really deserves an extra rating. I drank this in a hostel in Oost-Vleteren after visiting the abbey slightly to the west. Drank it after a Westy Abt and theres no doubt this is the superior beer. Deep brown colour, this bottle had pretty ordinary head retention but other bottles have had an incredible, mountainous head that goes absolutely nowhere. The aroma really makes the beer in this one - theres an incredible range of stuff in which little stands out above the rest; licorice, nutmeg, cardamom, brandied oranges, prunes, currants and even a touch of beechwood smokiness late. Carbonation is high bordering on explosive though I was drinking it after it sat in my bikes saddlebags for about 200km. The major knock on this beer is that its too sweet for my tastes to be perfect. As lachesis recommends, serving it slightly cool helps in this respect, but its hardly a major issue. Intense malt flavour without being caramelly and tasting ""dark"" without being roasty. Strong sultana fruitiness, no alcohol character at all. The sweetness is more light and worty than the really thick cloying type. Some more hop character and this is a world-classic for mine. Seems like this beer would age incredibly well, and I have a bottle, though how it survives the trip home after the trip on the bike is anyones guess. GREAT WORK CARLO!","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

2858,"2005-06-13",4.4,"2004 bottle provided by Rastacouere at the Mondial Ratebeer Tasting, 6/4/2005.  Hazy, drab-olive brown.  Very earthy toned and resembling the Trappist beers exactly.  Initial medium-sized beige head recedes slowly to cover/ring, leaving little lacing.  Raspberries, fresh and juicy, in the aroma, with deep, richly extracted brown malts and a smooth Belgian yeast.  Further sniffing provides more brown sugar, toffee, barley and yeast.  I love it! Very strong aroma.  Sweet toffee and brown sugar-like maltiness to start the flavor, light balancing bitterness and omnipresent yeast.  Just beautiful and artfully done.  Tannins provide light tartness, some brown tea-leaves towards the end and an easygoing, yet full body and mouthfeel.  Low carbonation, no alcohol noted, which is impressive, because I can find it in Westy 12 and Rocheforte 10.  Caramelly malt is decidedly malty, not sugary.

Raisins, smoke, abbaye des rocs like powerful esters and coriander/cardamom plus tea tannins. Rich toasty malt still has plenty of residual sugars bathing in an herbal garden. Drying nicely in mouth despite the massive sweetness. A fruit bacchanalia. Toffee, banana, corn, candi sugar and mellow leafy bitterness closes the encounter. Lightest carbonation, medium bodied..

Utterly engaging and decadent, emboldened by a superb head and its accompanying lacing. Im ready to get my scuba gear and dive in without an oxygen tank.

The Festivities:A dream house entirely made of chocolate mousse, of the eclectic variety of course. Dry nuts were used to erect sturdy walls, ground cocoa and luscious yeast were cemented into a succulent foundation, and toffee bars laid out as shingles. Milky coriander leaves and candied orange peels sparsely cover the walls in just the right quantity. You simply cannot ask for more luxury and comfort.

Transcendence:Pens are flying on paper, a tantalizing fairy tale is being written as we speak.

An aged batch (2-3 years old) presents similar complexities to fresher batches, still in a rich, velvety, smooth mouthfeel. These Struise guys have created a bona fide gem.

A tap version of the 2008 vintage at Ma Che Siete Venuti a Fà was even more engaging yet less spicy than the bottles I am used to. The roastier and fruitier (vinous, black cherries) profile was mindblowing.

I started her out with a gentle pour and a HUGE head formed. No need to go with a vigerous pour on this one. Poured dark brown with a HUGE off white head. The head had what I call lasting power as I had to wait forever until it was at a drinkable level. Left lacing all the way down and was heavily carbonated. The aroma was apricot, pear, and white grapes, as well as slighly sour and moderately sweet. At first I noticed a chocolate malt to the flavor. The beer started moderately sweet, but became more sweet with every sip. Some fruit flavors (cherry?) and caramel too. The palate was amongst the best I have ever had. It was like the tongue was being massaged by silk. Velvety silk smooth, simply glorious.

The nose is something special with sweet malt, dark fruit and redwine leading to a complex, fruity, vineous flavor with alcohol, dried fruit and sugary sweetness. Carbonation is good for style and mouthfeel is huge and almost sirupy. As the beer warms the sweetness may become a bit cloying on its own, making it the perfect companion for desserts. A grand beer, on par with some of the trappist brews.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","ChristianSA"
2858,"2005-02-11",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2005 A deep red beer with a huge brown head. The aroma is sweet spicy with notes of ginger and caramel. The flavor is very sweet and again with notes of spices and caramel.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

2858,"2005-01-08",5.0,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2005 This is the best beer so far. Strange hazy warm brown color with thick creamy froth. powerfull sweet nose with touche of gingerbread, caramel, coffee, speculoos, and almondcakes. The taste is on the sweet side and has a complex mix of spices, tropical wood (cigare box) caramel, coffee and x-mas pudding. In the aftertaste also touches dried fruits. Newyear gift from my kids.","gent, BELGIUM","lululegrand"
2858,"2004-12-19",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2006 Pours hazy dark brown with some yeast sediment and a foamy tan head. Both aroma and flavor is very full with plenty of malt, spices, prunes, raisins, yeast and dark fruit. Very soft and smooth with a long lasting finish. Quite sweet but the spices makes a really nice balance. A very nice Belgium ale in the same league as a lot of the Trappist beers! Big thanks to the great brewer Carlo (lachesis) for sending me this liquid delicacy.","Brooklyn, Alabama, USA","Jeppe"
2858,"2004-10-31",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2007 HUGE thanks to lachesis for this beer! Dark brown with ruby around the edges. Medium, dense fluffy tan head. Aroma is sweet with mild spices, custard, brown sugar, and dark chocolate. Perhaps even angel food cake. Taste is heavenly! Mild spice, more custard, brown sugar, light roasted malts, liquor, dark ripened fruits and cocoa. Body is thick and rich with strong carbonation and light alcohol warming. Finishes with more light spices, liquor, sweetened malts, rich custard, and sucrose. Light bittersweet chocolate as well. Awesome beer! This was the rating for batch two. Again, huge thanks go out to Carlo (lachesis)!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"

2858,"2004-10-10",3.8,"Murky brown color with hardly a lasting head. Aroma is a nice maltiness with some dried fruits. The taste is a bit strong of alcohol and vineous. Sweet caramel and figs follwed by dark roasted malts.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
2858,"2004-10-09",3.7,"The DM & Hotstuffs European Honeymoon trip beer number 34. This bottled brew from the t Brugs Beertje pub in Brugge poured a small head of white colored fine to medium sized mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a transparent yet semi cloudy orange brown colored body and a good lacing.  The aroma was malty with a strong vinous note and the mouth feel was tingly and bubbly from start to finish.  It had a nice malt hop dough sweet bread flavor.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
2858,"2004-10-03",3.1,"UPDATED: NOV 16, 2007 Poured a cloudy brown color with a large off white head and no lacing.  Aroma of mint, dark fruits, roast, yeast, and a funky barnyard aspect as well.  Taste was sweet raisins, chocolate, roast, tons of spices and an alcohol burn.  Too much spice in this one.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
2858,"2004-09-21",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2006 Hazy dark brown, nearly black; dirty yellow head. Rich, malty, portwine-like and chocolate/toffee nose, sweet but rich. Touch of tobacco and spices. Sweet taste; flavour of both sweet and bitter chocolates, a bit piney and resinous. Little hops. Marssala or portwine finish. Rich, velvety MF, full-bodied. Nice beer. I have a distinct impression this is less spiced than the Rochefortoise dark, and hence much sweeter in appearance.

 Pannepot 2006, Deca 
Colour: Huge yellow-brown head, near black beer. 4/5.
Nose: My co-taster says Coca-Cola, I get hazelnut, sweet, light  drop  and licorice, as well as some more herbs. We agree the beer has reminiscences of the early version of t Kappitel Watou, dubbed ""Bierchampagne"". 7/10
Taste: Caramelized apples, quite sweet-fruity, and alcohol; and indeed some cola. As well as a bit of tobacco + black cardemom. 7/10
Palate: Alcohol obvious, very well-bodied, sticky from yet unfermented sugars (beer is very young) 5/5
Overall: Well, this is really pretty good, but it promises heaven. Just give this 2-3 years to ripe and it is seventh heaven indeed. 18/20","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
