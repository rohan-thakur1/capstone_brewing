1053,"2017-05-19",3.8,"This is review of Dec. 2014 vintage. 

Pours a black, opaque body, head is paper thin and milk chocolate colored. Lacing was not really there and neither was head retention. 

Smell is complex, mix of port wine, maple syrup, whisky, and sweet wort. Hops arent present, and alcohol, for being 11%, isnt overpowering. 

Taste is big on burnt malt, port wine, tobacco, charred oak, and finishes with some alcohol. Beer has a good amount of sweetness to balance all the other strong flavors.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, kinda on the lighter side for an imperial stout. Wish head was around for longer, carbonation was sufficient. 

Overall beer was good, cant say I enjoyed it much more than the non barrel aged version. Solid nonetheless, too bad Dark horse doesnt distribute to Colorado.","Colorado, USA","Angelmonster"
1053,"2017-05-12",4.1,"Chucks 85th, Seattle. Barrel Roller 2017. Darker tan ring foam, eggshell as SinH4 would say. Mostly black with some red light edges. Intriguing aroma of beer, in the pure and simple barley sense, and sticky fruity barrel flavors. Fruity banana bread, fruit cake, chalky cocoa impressions. Choco-banana candies from ex-Yu. Nicely bitter finish. Banana rather dominates, but in a fuller sense than esters alone. Bitter cocoa and simpler pure stout flavors. Really nice.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"

1053,"2016-01-01",4.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, 2014 vintage bottling. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark brown head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, bourbon, vanilla, toasted oak, light smoke/char, light licorice/raisin, and roast/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, bourbon, vanilla, toasted oak, light smoke/char, light licorice/raisin, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, bourbon, vanilla, toasted oak, light smoke/char, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is a world class barrel aged imperial stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth and easy to sip on for the big ABV. The barrel integration and balance was absolutely spot on. There was no additional booziness or warming alcohol vs the base beer of similar age; and you still get plenty of the barrel flavor characteristics that arent overwhelming to the base stout at all. An insanely amazing offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

1053,"2015-11-20",4.1,"Pitch black and opaque with a one finger beige head that slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Very good retention for style and ABV, taking a while to settle and lingering throughout the pour. Sporadic streaks of soapy lacing left behind. 

Nice barrel presence in the nose thats decently integrated into the base. Stronger oak/wood/toothpick than expected wih sweet, spicy bourbon silky vanilla and marshmallow. Not overly boozy however with complex barrel character not just a complete bourbon bomb. Sweet an roasted malts underneath with some robust coffee bean, oatmeal, dark chocolate and liquid smoke. Some dessert like sweetness with silkier, lighter chocolate, lactic cream, caramel, toffee and bakers chocolate. Pretty tame aroma but its complex and well rounded. 

Fuller end of medium body with a strong, boozy barrel character thats nicely integrated into the flavors of the base beer. Again, theres a strong charred oak/toothpick character along with prominent spicy bourbon and boozy heat dominating the flavor. Lots of spicy bourbon along with vanilla bean and mallow. A touch of cinnamon and spicy heat but not too hot or overbearing. Although there is plenty of alcohol flavor, the high ABV is relatively well masked. Underneath the strong barrel flavors, there is some robust, roasted dark malt notes with burnt sugar, coffee grinds and bitter dark chocolate complimenting the oak and spirit. Could use a bit more sweetness but this beer is nicely balanced and surprisingly easy to drink at 14%. The complexity of the barrel component adds depth of flavor making this beer very enjoyable.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
1053,"2015-11-09",4.1,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Kuhnhenn snifter. 2012 vintage. Originally reviewed 1/2/2013. Very think inky black pour with a small mocha head. Nothing left after a while. Just a thin collar and three measly and miniscule islands of foam. The barrel is very nice, but the aroma of the beer is intense. Bourbon, tons of oak, and a nice hint of vanilla from the barrel. Sweet malts, licorice. Coffee and dark chocolate are afterthoughts compared to the barrel, booze, and sugars.

In the taste, the base beer shines through the barrel, but it adds a nice layer. Bourbon is immediately apparent. Deep dark chocolate flavors and a sweet fruit layer. Oak is really intense in the back. Lingering oaky finish is too strong and just pegs it back from perfect. Its heavy, boozy, and overly oaked. Low carbonation. A monster of a beer.
 While this beer is spectacular, the barrel hasnt improved it. Intense oak creates an unpleasant aftertaste. That being said, I had this on tap and it was incredible. Batch to batch may vary. I certainly wont mind exploring different vintages of this.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

The bourbon barrel aged version of an already great American RIS, so I was very curious about this. Deep beige, stable head over a practically black beer; complex and beguiling aroma of indeed rich bourbon and beautiful woody tannins, spanning a whole array of basic RIS qualities, including chocolate, coffee grounds, banana peel, bayleaf, deep caramel, candied dates; very rich and complex taste, basically the regular Plead the 5th with all its depth, velvety mouthfeel and deep caramelly and chocolatey maltiness along with a prolonged roasted bitterness in the end, but deepened further with drying but delicious woody notes (tannins) as well as bourbon warmth, a bit alcoholic but only adding complexity and elevating this wonderful stout to a higher gastronomic level.

Has a viscous black color, with a dark brown, fizzy head, revealing a small film of lacing at the edge of the glass.

Smells of cocoa nibs, toffee and lots of warm oak, exhibiting distinct vanilla notes. A hint of cinnamon settles among toasted malts and tobacco, while the aromas lead into a rich chocolate direction. Well pronounced barrel reveals quite a bit of Bourbon, which gets gently balanced by melted chocolate. 

Drinks expectedly smooth, letting the complex character evolve.

Tastes of bakers chocolate and fudge, accompanied by whipped cream, while scorched malts, hot oak, cinnamon and mint reveal the beers fantastic flavors. The brews smooth mouthfeel sets new standards, which gets especially well accentuated by carbonized malts, earth and bitter coffee, providing a tremendous range of flavors. Has a hot, oak supported finish, with toffee, fudge and vanilla on top, while coffee creates a long lasting, slightly dry ending, with tobacco and earth.

Awesome beer, incredibly rich in flavors - very focused on creamy chocolate, and roasted coffee with burned malts as its counterpart, while staying focused and in perfect balance. This intriguing melange gets enriched by the hot boubon barrel, adding vanilla and wooden oak to the taste, as well as a hot glow. Chocolate developes on the palate, beginning as creamy milk chocolate, while ending as slick bitter chocolate.","GERMANY","aleigator"

This was poured into a tulip. 
The appearance was basically a pure jet black color with barely any head and left some splotches of light lacing. 
The smell was mainly sweet chocolate with a light roast. Light coffee surrounded a gentle woodiness. Bourbon never really reared its head.
The taste was basically the same leading into a mostly roasty quality of aftertaste and a semi - dry finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a good sipping quality about it. Carbonation was barely there but Im not worried since it was a 2012 bottle. 
Overall, I say for the year of the bottle everything was pretty smoothed out and balanced with lack of bourbon. I bet if I would have had it fresher I would have noticed the bourbon. Still, a mostly good beer.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Its sweet which is nice, theres a little coffee and a touch of smoked malt.

1053,"2014-02-28",3.7,"2011 vintage on draught at Deep Ellum, 2/22/14Wow, glad I just happened to stop in to Deep Ellum in the 14 hour window this stuff was on tap, haha.Pretty cool that they just threw this aged keg on with no fanfare or announcement and even cooler that I was there to try it.Pours an inky black, seemingly opaque, with a fleeting beige head that recedes quickly and completely.Molasses, light milk chocolate and dry, leafy, mildly citric hops up front while the bourbon character rounds out the finish with very light butter-rum and coconut notes. Nice and reserved, just the way it should be. Aroma strength is medium, much due to the very low carbonation, and probably in part to the barrel tannin as well. No flaws and very little of the alcohol noted (this cant possibly be 14%, by the way).Soft, silky and rich in the mouth, it certainly has all the characteristics of Dark Horse. Comforting, almost chewy texture, well-extracted, rich malts, no obnoxious/overdone flavors. Milk chocolate and light roast are most prominent, while some vanilla-like dryness and a bit of rum soaked raisin notes help balance. Very very low carbonation and again, no sign of the alcohol. Yes, its Plead the 5th, which in my mind, is a well-done but fairly simplistic Imperial Stout, with an added layer of bourbon. So in this case, the barrel-aging actually helps add depth, but ultimately, Im not wowed by the rather lacking vinous/roast/prune notes that I really love in a great imperial. Still, nothing to scoff at and Id happily drink this over many (most?) other imperial stouts. Though it loses some points in complexity, it makes up alot of that in balance and mouthfeel.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Looks like 5W-20 that was due for a change 5,000 miles ago. Aroma is mind-blowing with the most smooth bourbon & oak character Ive encountered. Heavy fudge & cocoa beans, vanilla, light coconut, smooth bourbon, wet oak & wood, deeply roasted malts, brown sugar, & a creamy coffee undertone. Distinct, wonderful, complex... The taste is no different. Creamy, smooth mouth feel with light syrup & sweet molasses up front. Warming bourbon comes through big, but is literally the smoothest induction of bourbon into a beer that Ive tasted. Oak, vanilla, faint nuttiness, dark fudge, bittersweet cocoa, a touch of ripe dates, roasted coffee, a mild milkiness, & a good amount of brown sugar. Bourbon, oak, chocolate, brown sugar, & coffee in a lovely, mouth coating finish. The best bourbon barrel aged beer Ive had, bar none. This is how its done, folks.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

1053,"2013-10-12",4.4,"2012 Vintage 12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.

Bourbon Plead the Fifth comes out of the bottle without any hurry, filling up my glass with an obsidian black liquid. Adjusting to an aggressive pour, I am able to encourage a small dark mocha head to form for a few minutes. It slowly gives way to a thin ring of dark froth around the edges and leaves just a couple spots of lace on the glass.

The aroma at this stage has such a nice balance between the the chocolate and roasted notes from the stout and the character from the barrel. It almost feels like rich fudge is entering my nose as first, with roasted notes, a bit of coffee, lots of vanilla, and finally a smooth bourbon note.

The flavor starts off with rich dark chocolate fudge, with vanilla and bourbon twisting their way in. As my palate adjusts to the flavor overload, roasted malt and a bit of bitter coffee notes work their way in. A small amount of general dark fruit flavor comes in later on in the sip. It starts out very sweet, and ends up being a bit more rounded by the end of the sip. The flavors work so well together.

Each sip is a reeducation about how the mouthfeel of a bourbon barrel stout should feel. Thick and rich, the barrel did nothing to reduce the impressiveness of this mouthfeel. The carbonation is nearly crushed by the thickness of the beer but retains a silky smooth quality.

Overall this is definitely a very well made bourbon barrel stout. It is definitely worth seeking out and having around. At this point I have not had it at different ages, but it is delicious with almost a year on it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

1053,"2013-05-16",4.2,"2012 bottle from Jim M. Thanks! Poured into my LA Teku.

A: Pours in an inky, almost treacly manner to the glass. Fills up with a solid dark mocha head which fades quickly. Some carbonation bubbles are disturbing the surface of this black puddle. Legs are thick, thick, thick.

N: Hearty bourbon with a big chocolate and espresso background. Vanilla and caramel and oak. Coconut and more fudge. Brown sugar and some molasses. Big sweet sugars here. Some rye  and oatmeal.

T: Very, very sweet. Bourbon appropriates the top level here and adds a sweet sting on top of a very pronounced sweet malt body. Theres a little bit of earth, pine and spice from what I assume are the hops and theres some additional roast. This has some surprising balance, though its still a heavy confection. Does have a salty soy sauce aspect.

M: Super boozy, but its got a wonderfully filling mouthfeel. Other RISs should pay attention to this aspect, its the best Ive had outside Apple Brandy Hunahpus.

O: I wish I had split this bottle because its absolutely going to sit in my stomach, but at the same time, I dont think Im going to get sick of it. This might get a few more points if it turned down the bourbon heat, but at the same time, its done an excellent job of making both the bourbon and the stout distinct, so what else can you want?","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

1053,"2013-03-30",4.7,"12 oz bottle from a trade with a Michigander. Poured into Teku stemware. Enjoyed in the presence of James Bond.

I poured this hallowed stout just past the curve in my glass. A small khaki head rose just under half an inch above the surface of the liquid, which is extremely dark, opaque, and ominous in appearance. The warm aroma of cacao nibs, bitter dark chocolate, freshly made bold coffee, and a whiff of Kentucky magic. Theres even a prominence of caramel in the nose as the brew warms. 

Taste is, not surprisingly, fantastic. Rich milk and bitter dark chocolates move in tandem with the bitter hop backing. Bourbon is so well integrated you often forget this beer was aged in bourbon barrels. Bold espresso briefly appears without adding considerably to bitterness level and disappears into the signature vanilla/oak barrel character. There is simultaneous abrasiveness and refinement that put thisd in a league of its own. For being only a few months old, this magnificent ale shows grand maturity and undebatable quality. 

Mouthfeel is perfect for my taste. Body is full and amply carries the beers immense character. Carbonation is present throughout the liquid. My tongue is left coated with a chocolate oil slick feeling.

Aroma has nice chocolate notes with complimentary bourbon and vanilla character. There are secondary notes of coffee and oak. As the beer warms you pick up a bit of dark fruit but its fairly low. No hop aroma and only faint alcohol notes. 
Pours a deep black with a dark mocha head that clings to the edges but never really forms in the center. No lacing and mid sized legs. 
Flavor has more roast and alcohol than in the aroma but still well balanced. Starts with more sweet, dark chocolate and vanilla. Mid palate the roast steps in with some oak. The finish has bourbon, vanilla, a hint of dark fruit and bittersweet chocolate. There is some alcohol spice in the finish. Medium low bitterness and no astringency. 
Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation. Medium high alcohol warmth and low astringency. 
Overall this is a really nice beer. I am usually let down by some of the hyped beers I trade for but this one at least partially lived up to the hype. As it warns the alcohol does become a bit hot though.

1053,"2013-01-22",3.4,"Very think inky black pour with a small mocha head. Nothing left after a while. Just a thin collar and three measly and miniscule islands of foam. The barrel is very nice, but the aroma of the beer is intense. Bourbon, tons of oak, and a nice hint of vanilla from the barrel. Sweet malts, licorice. Coffee and dark chocolate are afterthoughts compared to the barrel, booze, and sugars. Bourbon is immediately apparent. Deep dark chocolate flavors and a sweet fruit layer. Oak is really intense in the back. Lingering oaky finish is too strong and just pegs it back from perfect. Its heavy, boozy, and overly oaked. Low carbonation. While this beer is good, the barrel hasnt improved it. Intense oak creates an unpleasant aftertaste.","","ianhuntley73"

A - Pours a thick black body with a finger of dark mocha head. After that fizzles away its quite difficult to recreate a head with a swirl. Just some splotchy lacing with some nice retention. Alcohol legs stain the sides of the glass.

S - Bourbon dipped fudge brownie is the description I would use here. Rich and gooey dark chocolate, dry cocoa powder, light espresso and coconut. Finishes with smooth oak and vanilla and warming alcohol which does comes off as a bit too distracting.

T - Starts with dark chocolate and light roasted malts. Then comes a huge wave of vanilla, oak, and butterscotch. Lighter notes of coffee beans, coconut, and dark fruits. The finish is fudge with a bit of leather. Rich and decadent, just fucking perfect!

M - Thick and coating, just a notch below syrupy. Carbonation is spot on.

O - Truly one of the best BA stouts out there. How anyone can trade this stuff after sampling it is beyond me.

Hot damn. Thick wood (hehe) notes, vanilla, bourbon, breakfast syrup, boozy finish. I feel like the vanilla might really pop with some age. Unfortunately, this is my one and only bottle but Im very grateful to have had the chance to try it!

Just another example of why the midwest conquers every other corner of the world when it comes to imperial stouts.","Orono, Minnesota, USA","FURLYSURIOUS"

This beer pours a full bodied, black chocolate black with no head but a dark khaki lacing around the rim. The nose is very rich and roasty. T has some fudge brownie to it, LOADS of chocolate. That said, there isnt much bourbon at all. The flavors are really smooth and chocolaty. Again, loads of chocolate fudge and brownie. There is barely any bourbon at all and moderate roast. Great flavor on the chocolate standpoint, but disappointing in terms of barrel aged imperial stouts. This is the most palatable chocolate Ive ever experienced in a beer. It is pretty light in body, compared to others of the style. I would describe it as a light medium. It does however increase drinkability. Overall this is a very nice beer, but doesnt show the bourbon you would expect. If I had to guess, I would say that this is oak aged or just aged regular Plead the 5th. All of that said, this beer was delicious.","Fishers, Indiana, USA","aasher"

The beer is near black with a thin, beige cap. The aroma offers bourbon and roast, followed by alcohol, vanilla, oak, chocolate. Great flavor, with prominent bourbon throughout. Additional tastes of vanilla and chocolates. Moderately low carbonation, with a smooth, buttery feel. A bit of heat in the finish, but 14% abv feels pretty nice. Overall, very enjoyable. A top notch barrel-aged imperial stout.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

Strong whiffs of chocolate and bourbon invade the senses upon cracking the bottle.  Theres also quite a bit of black licorice here too.  Mocha, ash, wood, and a touch of molasses round out the scent.  The aroma certainly shows some alcohol too.  Pretty good depth.  The flavor is equally as impressive, but showing some different things.  An ashy charcoal mixes with caramel, strong mocha, and of course, bourbon to provide the meat of the flavor.  Notes of damp wood too coming from the barrel with a bit of vanilla as well.  Its silky in the body and smooth going down.  The alcohol noted in the aroma is more subtle than I was expecting.  A soothing sipper for sure.  Surprisingly, I dont really pick up much black licorice, as noted so heavily in the aroma.

Bourbon aroma is very prominent. Sweet bourbon aroma, rather soft boozieness. Big chocolate and caramel aromas meld seamlessly with the bourbon. Moderate roast and vanilla noted. 

The flavor starts out bourbon heavy before a healthy dose of chocolate floods the palate. A rather assertive roasted malt flavor begins to emerge on the midpalate. The caramel flavor is much more subtle in the bottle version than on tap. Flavors are well integrates though not nearly as much as the tap version. A bit of heat on the back is noted but not obstructive. 

Full bodied Imperial Stout. The carbonation levels are low and appropriate. Very silky, soft texture. The finish is long and enjoyable.

Poured from a bomber into a snifter

A. Pours a dark charcoal color with a caramel head about 1mm thick. Settles as a nice foamy ring around the glass

S. Sweet chocolate dominating the smell, noticeable bourbon, caramel and light fruit

T. Sweet and sugary, but not overbearing at all. Very very malty, with dark chocolate and a slight toffee finish.

M. Medium body, coarse and dry finish

O. This is true a top shelf beer. Its sweet but not over done, very malty but not dominating the whole beer, the chocolate is at a good level, and a nice light coffee finish. This is a beer I will be looking to get more and more of. I suggest everyone try this!","Minnesota, USA","MBrausen"

1053,"2012-01-13",4.1,"355mL 2011 ed silver wax thanks to mikem409. Pours ink with a larger reddish mocha head settling abruptly to a bubbly layer. Nose is richer vanilla with thicker sweet bourbon. Very reminiscent of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. Rich wood and mild dark cherries. Very inviting, dessert nose. Taste is silky, rich, spicy bourbon, big dark chocolate. Thankfully only hints of ash that sometimes plague Dark Horse beers. Bitter, thicker. Very enjoyable. Great palate. Lower carbonation with super rich, oily palate. Beautiful stuff. Underrated even in the Top 100. Should be Top 50.

Nose holds beautiful vanilla bean, woody bourbon, rich creamy lactic sweetness, and some lovely roast character that, thankfully, fights through the barrel aged sweetness.

1053,"2012-01-07",4.2,"12oz bottle from my favorite MI trader.

Pours pitch black, just like the regular 5th with a small mocha head that recedes slowly to a thin collar with a little lacing.

Aroma is very sweet with lots of vanilla and dark chocolate with a solid bourbon presence.  There are some roasted malts in the nose but its definitely sweet with some molasses coming through, maybe hints of smoke and leather.  Gorgeous nose.

Taste is thick and chocolaty with heavily roasted black malts and licorice anchoring the backbone.  The vanilla is still there but more subtle than the nose and the wood from the barrel is more prominent in the finish.

The mouthfeel is wonderful, fullish and creamy, with the perfect amount of carbonation, just sticking to the palate after each sip.

The nose is more complex than the nose with the sweetness mixing with the barrel perfectly.  The taste isnt quite as nice but  its still excellent.  This is a nice example of what barrels can add to a beer.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
1053,"2012-01-07",4.3,"A big thanks to Thorpe for letting me have some of this beer during our impromptu epic New Years Day tasting. 

Beer served in a sniffer. Beer is black, oily, this dark brown head of small bubbles, low retention, falls back to halo the glass minimal lacing and low carbonation. 

Aroma is sweet, chocolate, strong malt presence. The boubon come through strong. Mild oak. Smells like a big bourbon stout. 

Beer is medium to big in body, malty sweet with a strong bourbon character. Fudge and chocolate with minimal roast. The sweetness carries through all the way to the end. The bourbon wins in this beer. So sweet, so oaky, vanilla, booze but without heat. I really liked it.

1053,"2011-12-22",4.3,"12 oz. silver wax dipped bottle, 2011 vintage.  Dense, viscous, and fudgy looking, the nearly black body is almost impenetrable by light.  This is the darkest beer Ive seen in some time.  An initially moderate head of light brown to mocha colored froth settles quickly to a smooth, swirly surface patch with a thick gathering of bubbles at the edges.  After each sip, viscous, drippy legging recedes, giving way to small, wet spots of lace.The nose is decadent, yet delectable.  The depth to which dark chocolate fudge is portrayed here is difficult to convey.  Brownies swirled with caramel and walnuts also come to mind.  The barrel application is incredibly smooth and unobtrusive here.  Its not overly woody or even the least bit alcoholic.  Instead, the barrel imparts velvety, creamy vanilla and hints of coconut macaroon.  In short, this stuff smells pretty incredible.Flavors show many of the same general elements, though they arent quite as well integrated as they are in the nose.  I mean, the dark, rich fudge and nutty, caramel-laden brownie are there in force, but the barrel is also considerably more prominent and woody.  There are some bittersweet dark cacao notes that come across a little more biting and earthen, and a nip of booze is detectable.  Dont get me wrong, its still incredibly well done as barrel-aged imperial stouts go, but compared to the nose, there are a few minor shortfalls.The palate is creamy and airy for a 10%, heavily sugared brew, lifted up by soft, pillowy carbonation.  Though there are obviously a hefty amount of residual sugars here, the relatively dry yeast and perfect carbonation do a good job of keeping it in check, or at least ushering it out quickly.  Whats left is a lingering, mouth coating sensation equivalent to what it feels like to have just swallowed a shot of coconut cream...and the aftertaste isnt far off from that either.Overall, this is an incredibly well done barrel aged beer.  You can search high and low, near and far, and you wont find many example better than this.  I generally hate the style these days, but this brew reminded me that when things are on point, they can be absolutely delicious.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

T - Fairly similar to the nose. Hints of vanilla, chocolate, brown sugar, dry oak tannins, and a big dose of booze at the end of each sip. Pretty sweet initially but it gets better as it warms up. It has a ton of flavor but it remains easy to drink.

1053,"2011-09-09",4.1,"Had this on the eve of the August 27th JOs bottle release. Big thanks for sharing this. ~2 oz from a tasting snifter.

4.5 A: Black. Small medium brown head with good lacing.

5.0 S: Excellent duality between bourbon and beer. Sweet leathery bourbon that integrates seemlessly with the stout. Bourbon and barrel contribute a light fruitiness and touches of oak, but leave out any astringency. Super smooth I say. The beer below offers a deep chocolate, moderate roast, and ample caramel. Mild coffee too. Awesome.

4.0 T: Not as comples as the nose suggests. The sweetness is there with the chocolate and caramel, but the roastiness is much subdued. Mild sourishness, but not the infected kind. Moderate bourbon contributions and subtle oak. Its impossible to think that this is 14%. I still dont believe it.

4.0 M: Heavy body, but on the lighter end of the spectrum. Good moderate carbonation. Reasonably creamy.

4.5 D: A great beer that would be worth seeking out if they made a reasonable amount of it.

Loud yields a beer that is near black with a thin whisper of a mocha head without any real retention, just a few bubbles here and there.  The nose brings forward all sorts of delight with nice bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate, and roast.  Also, there was a bit of a creamy peanut butter note that I really enjoyed.

No hint of the huge alcohol presence. Drinks quite well and my pour was gone well before I had gotten enough of this to satisfy my thirst.  Thanks again, Eric!

The flavor is great; sweet bourbon, earthy woodiness, dark fruit, roast, very smooth and easygoing. Awesome. Re-rate: had a 12 ounce bottle thanks to Beau.

A black pour with only a little head, this was a good pour not much of note on the head, but lacing was lacking...The aroma is really and you can tell it is really enhanced by an excellent job of barrel aging. The bourbon presents nicely as vanilla, light bourbon, and molasses and does not present woody or alocholic at all...The taste is just as nice as the aroma, again its sweet bourbon flavors vanilla, lots of molasses. Its sweet but not too sweet for a ris...The feel is really nice nice lasting flavor, no warming finish as you would expect for the abv...The drinkabillity is great, best high abv beer Ive had, now way you would guess this is 14%.

1053,"2011-02-15",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 13, 2014 Compared the 11 and 12 next to each other.  Pour is jet black with a dark caramel head but not a lot even after a strong pour.  Nose is a nice mix of bourbon and light chocolate cake. There are some chalky notes and a bit of booze in back.  Taste is more woody, light bourbon.  Chocolate notes, faintly chalky but less than the nose.  Full bodied and soft, a hint slick with moderate carbonation.  Taste gets a little sweet in back and some lingering roasted malts.
The 11 has a richer nose and less sweet in the flavor.  More balanced but less bright so you sacrifice a little in flavor expression for balance and tightness.  Both are very solid, I would prefer the 11 with the 2 years in it.  Rate from the 11.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
