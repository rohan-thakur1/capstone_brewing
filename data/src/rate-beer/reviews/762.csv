-  Theres a mild fruity tartness is taste that is quite enjoyable. 
-  Body is medium, but maybe a bit thin. Soft carbonation. 
-  Its rather easy drinking.

Another forgotten gem discovered in the back of my stash - Im guessing its more than a year old based on when it was originally released, but its still in quite good shape. Pours a dark amber-brown with a very slight haze - well, initially slight, at least - after the first slow pour, I poured the last 1/4 or so into a separate glass, and it was quite hazy, even a bit chunky, so the yeast obviously settled during its unintentional aging. Aroma has a subtle port-like character that couldve come from oxidization, along with the clove promised by the description, a hint of banana, and some tart fruitiness. Flavour starts a bit tart and spicy before some lovely chocolate-malt comes through, followed by a more prominent tartness in the back of the throat. Also something herbaceous in there that I cant quite place - coriander, maybe? Whatever, in a nice note to finish on.

Alcohol is well hidden. Taste is well balanced. It carries yeasty, citrusy, and woody notes. Ends with a decent bittersweet finish. Enjoyable and well done!","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
762,"2011-09-13",3.8,"750 ml bottle from LCBO.  Pours cloudy deep amber in colour, with nice big frothy tan head.  Aroma and taste are nutty, sweet malt, with hints of banana, cloves and alcohol, finishes with a slight tang.  Pretty good!","Waterloo, Ontario, CANADA","jimmay"
762,"2011-09-13",3.9,"Its good, 8 bucks good? Probably not, but good enough that I dont regret buying it at least once. Aroma of banana bread, spices, clove, beef broth? Flavour is big on the banana and cloves with under currents of chocolate and coffee, im pretty sure thats exactly what it says in the description too. . . .weird.. ..","Guelph, CANADA","wilderthanyou"
762,"2011-09-13",3.6,"600ml bottle. Poured a clouded dark brown beer with a puffy off white cap. Lively carbonation. Aroma is right on the money for a Munich weizen dunkelbock  Clove phenols, banana-fruity esters, decent cocoa tones from dark malts and Toffee-like Caramalt undertones. Medium body, sandy mouth feel, fruity-cocoa semi dry character. Flavor profile sees lots of cara-malt and fruity-spicy discernment in the front side, mid palate some mild complexity with roasty-cocoa-malty-fruity amalgam, - goes to a longer conclusion where the minty Perle hopping shows up to compliment the wheat malts in drying up the finish.

A robust and well-crafted homogeneous seasonal offering from what is arguably Ontarios best craft brewer. Another Teutonic brew nicely carried off by Beaus. Kudos.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"
762,"2011-09-13",3.8,"Pour murky brown with a decent beige head. Aroma banana syrup, blue bubble gum, clove, very light chocolate, quite sweet. Taste light chocolate, banana, clove, light spice, bubble gum, caramel. MF medium body nice lively carb. Very solid seasonal brew from these guys well done.","Kitchener, Ontario, CANADA","JB84"
762,"2011-09-13",3.7,"600 ml bottle - pours murky brown with small tan head.  Aroma of banana, bubblegum, clove, raisin, caramel.  Flavour sweet/tart mix with a good malt dose playing with some yeasty phenolics.  Dark fruit, spice, some candyish quality.  Dry, spicy finish.  Touch of alcohol present as it warms.  Really nice.","Parkdale, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","VeloVampire"
762,"2011-09-12",3.9,"600mL bottle from the Lickbow. Over-priced? Maybe. I enjoyed it though and Im not bankrupt, so I guess all is well. Pours a hazy brown with a large off-white head. Aroma has some good deep dark malts, loads of yeast, and something similar to peanut butter? Thats just my interpretation. Flavour is nice and satisfying, full of rich roasted caramalt, a body boosted by the yeast, some wheat characters, as well as a dry finish with that same odd but pleasing peanut butter aspect. Its not like peanuts or diaceytl, just a faint whiff of a food I love in a rich and tasty beer. Not much booze to speak of nor hops, but this is a very well done beer. I like the concept.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"
762,"2011-09-11",3.4,"2011-09-10. Hazy brown body with a small tan head. 3+ Flavour has a wheaty bite to it. Sweet dark malt has mild sugar and caramel character. Tangy wheat finish. 7+ Aroma is similar sweet caramel malt with tart wheat accents. 7+ Smooth average bodied palate. 3+ Pretty decent take on the style. Enjoyable.

762,"2011-09-08",3.4,"Bottle. Dark brown orange with a medium beige head with good retention. Aroma is banana syrup, raisins, toasted wheat and bread. Flavor is toasted malt, biscuits, wheat, banana, a hint of warming alcohol and very mild bitterness. Medium body with average carbonation.","Mirabel, Quebec, CANADA","Diogène"
762,"2011-09-07",4.1,"600ml bottle. Drank in a chalice. Pours brown, seems rather hazy. Almost no head, which is a bit disturbing (3)
Aroma is somewhat boozy, but quite heavy on cloves, vanilla and banana. Traditionnal wheat aroma as well, with hints of raisins and caramel. (8-)
Taste is... just, wow! Restrained bitterness with lots of vanilla and banana, with cloves and wheat malt coming afterward. Finish is... astringent (?). Feels like a doped-up dunkelweizen. No booze taste-- to be honest, the aroma scared me on that. (9) 
Palate is extremely smooth -- probably too smooth for a WeizenBock (...that tells how much this one is smooth) and somewhat oily as well.(4) 
Overall.... Hummm... Drink early, drink often? :P TERRIFIC. 
Its considered a Dunkelweizen, but in the description, it says its a WeizenBock. Oh well... (17)","Gatineau/St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","MXD"
762,"2011-09-03",3.4,"600 ml bottle from LCBO.  Pours a slightly orange-ish brown with a small eggshell head.  Aroma is full of clove with some soft banana and apple.  Flavour is also quite clovey and fruity with a mild roastiness nicely balancing the sweetness.  Gentle carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel.  Nice.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Spab"
