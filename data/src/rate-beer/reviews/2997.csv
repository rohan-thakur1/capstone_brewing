2997,"2013-12-18",2.7,"Bottle:
Clear, bubbly gold with a soft white head.
Scent is light, sweet grain malt...lemon.
Taste is cider-like, tangy apple, lemon.
A little stale, but still fairly sharp bodied.
Much better than Hercules Lager.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
2997,"2012-10-01",2.5,"Aroma is malts and a strong resemblance of paint.  The flavor is citrus, the off-paint like from the aroma, a hint of cider and a hint of hops in the finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
2997,"2011-10-17",2.2,"Bottle.  Almost identical to the standard Hercules Lager aside from a little extra alcohol and a deeper hue to the golden color.  Still pretty good stuff.","Hamilton Twp., New Jersey, USA","NJBeerman013"
2997,"2011-08-26",2.5,"Bottle. Pours yellow/gold, with a white head. Aroma is malt, grain, and sugar. Flavor is much the same as the aroma, with a little fruit in there too. Medium body. Not too bad.","Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA","zathrus13"
2997,"2011-01-22",2.3,"bottle - Pours clear gold with a very small white head.  It smells of light, grainy malt.  The flavor is sweet, smooth, grainy malt.  Theres some light hops bitterness in there.  Its not too, too bad.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"
2997,"2010-07-15",2.5,"A pale yellow pour with very little white head.  The aroma is like wet hay mixed with some faint hops and cat piss.  The taste is sweet with obvious alcohol of a vodkalike quality and a quick finish.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","Finhead"
2997,"2010-06-25",2.4,"Bottle from Malt & Vine. So, the finest German malt and hops turn into: Pours gold with a foamy white head. LIghtly bready aroma with mild grassy/floral hop. Medium body, light sharpish carbonation. Flavor is a little bready, and then the hop bitter takes over. The hop is more herby than grassy, but its there. No particular heat to notice. Not my preference, but better than many malt liquors. Id drink it all, if nothing better was around.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
2997,"2010-03-24",2.1,"(bottle - 22 oz) Clear gold with a fizzy white head. Aroma is sweet corn, grass, and some hops. Very mild. Very sweet at the start with a lot of corn notes mixing with some wet grass and a very mild bitter hop finish. Watery and plasticy at the finish. Eh.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"
