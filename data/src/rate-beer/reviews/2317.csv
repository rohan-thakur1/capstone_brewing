2317,"2017-01-15",5.0,"La Stille Nacht fait sans conteste partie du cercle des bières de Noël dexception dont elle en transcende les codes. Pour lapprécier et la comprendre pleinement, il faut bien entendu aimer les bières puissantes, car avec ses 12 % Abv, la nuit a beau être douce, elle en possède pour autant du caractère. Mais cette puissance est totalement mise à profit à la chaleur, la densité et à la longueur de la bière. Mais en premier lieu, mention spéciale pour létiquette, qui dans un style naïf-excentrique, nous fait être entièrement dans une atmosphère de saison. En verre, notre Stille Nacht se pare dune belle robe blond vénitien. Cependant, de par une effervescence peu poussée, elle ne possède quasiment pas de mousse. Le 12 % Abv ny sont pas étrangers. Et de toute façon, demande t on à un virtuose dêtre un top modèle? Le nez est splendide, à la fois doux et très complexe avec des arômes de miel, candi, réglisse poire et banane. Une superbe entrée en matière. Lattaque est soyeuse à souhait. Les bases dune bonne bière de Noël sont posées. Sur un fond de céréales et de miel, sexpriment des arômes épicés (notamment de poivres) et de Guenièvre (conférant une touche doriginalité). La suite est somptueuse. Il faut alors souligner la fois lintelligence chez De Dolle dutiliser du Houblon Nugget (amérisant fort et arômes lourds dépices) mais également leur maîtrise dans son utilisation notamment avec un houblonnage à cru. Celui-ci lui confère de la puissance et ce côté corsé tant attendu que lon retrouve en seconde bouche. Les arômes se portent alors sur les plus grands whisky avec des nuances sans limite mais avec une précision redoutable à linstar dun grand Django Rheinardt, pouvant faire glisser ses doigts sur le manche de sa guitare avec une précision hors du commun tout en pouvant varier autour dune mélodie pendant des heures avec la plus grande des virtuosités. Larrière bouche quant à elle est dense et pleine, sur le miel et le fruits conférant une excellente corpulence et une homogénéité sans faute. Léquilibre alcool-sucre est parfait. Le final incroyablement long, marquera davantage les notes épicées couplées à des arômes dagrumes. Que la nuit est douce, que la nuit est belle... Still a Stille Nacht avec les De Dolle Brouwers.","FRANCE","jybi"

Moderate amount of carb visible, medium size bubbles. Pretty! Nose is a fruity and spicy one - fruity notes leaning on the sour side a bit and very candied with some orange, apple, blueberry, cherry, estery banana, non-pithy citrus, gooseberry, maybe even a tiny hint of lychee or something similarly tropical. Lots of yeasty spice too, quite funky/musty, some honey malt and powdered sugar. Quite phenolic as it warms with some fortified wine notes developing. Really interesting nose overall. Taste is heavy and strong, big, sweet, sour, almost medicinal fruity kick bringing candied orange, wine gums, lemon, port wine, and plenty of white/powdered sugar. Yeasty spice, esters, allspice, cinnamon, white pepper, pithy, resinous hoppy bitterness in the finish with lingering cereal and spice. Seems a little stale towards the end which is a shame. Booze, obviously, but definitely not overpoweringly. Fantastic balance of flavours overall, just a shame about that staleness.

I believe that its especially these factors that will do a lot of good things to this brew if you cellar this properly for a couple of years. The brewer advises on cellaring and lots of people who have followed this advise say this brew really works its magic if you let it rest in some dark, cool place for a couple of years.

Update (24 december 2016):
Bottle 2015 vintage, tastes much more rounded, alcohol is not as sharp as last year, tastes sweet, candy sugar is still very much present. Still lot of apricots, plums, raisins, pepper, caramel, orange peel, honey, maple syrup. Alcohol is still present but not overwhelmingly as when drunk fresh. Taste has definitely evolved to a higher level, much more rounded. Tastes absolutely amazing. This is a very unique beer, one of a kind and cant really be compared to anything else out there. Sip it like a really fine cognac and you will be richly rewarded.","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","Antonio369"

Perfumey, tempting aroma of orange, pineapple, ripe peach, amaretto, flowery hops, spiciness, whisky; very vividly fruity taste, almost like fresh orange juice, quickly becoming yeasty, spicy and malty, honeyish, slick and creamy mouthfeel, dry finish with floral, aromatic hops and lots of booze, but fortunately not becoming wry, long and satisfying. The older version of 8,1% ABV, made with Rodenbach yeast and basically a blend of old Boskeun beers, was better still, more balanced and less alcoholic.

2317,"2014-02-26",4.5,"This is one of the very best. At least for my taste. Poured into an Oerbier glass, the first thing youll notice is the color. Unlike almost every other Christmas beer, Stille Nacht is clear orange. The aroma is very complex and difficult to describe: apple, maybe some honey, some vanilla (?). The head is white and lasts pretty long. Onto the first sip. Again, a pretty unique tasting experience... Starts off sweet, yet the finish is rather dry with some roasted malts and you can notice the hops. Love the apple like taste, which makes this quite refeshing. I will try to keep some of these bottles in the cellar for aging, but it will be quite the challenge. 

To summarize: another great beer by Dolle Brouwers, but that is no surprise. Hope I can get hold of a Reserva one day.","BELGIUM","wouterv"

Taste of Stille Nacht is nearly complex, alcohol is present from the very beginning and lingers till the end. Very yeasty, lots of spices on my tongue, cinnamon, clove, pepper, burned malt, sugar, honey and a little bitterness at the end, which enhances the sweetness of the sugar.

2317,"2013-12-23",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2014 2007 bottle, picked up at Bottleworks and consumed in the dead of night on Christmas Eve Eve. Bottle gushed all the hell over me and my kitchen floor -- thats what I get for not being prepared. Anyway, gushes a really unattractive, murky, sediment-suspended light brown with pillowy offwhite head all over the bottle, but not a ton left in the glass. Aroma is really nice and layered. Apple is the first thing, followed by cotton candy, some (not at all unpleasant) oxidation, cherries, figs. Moderately sweet, lengthy finish, some alcohol warmth. Love how the apples and toffee and booze go on and on and on. Palate: Full, sticky body with all kinds of carbonation. Overall: Despite the gushing, this is a really beautiful beer (I mean, it aint much too look at, but the nose/taste is remarkable). Ive steered clear of Belgin strongs somewhat because they dont tend to resonate with me, but this could very well change my mind. Had I been smarter with my purchase I would have bought a 2013 to have side-by-side and do this all scientifically.

  Vertical with OldMrCrow on Feb 10th.  Bottles from 2013, 2009, 2005, and 1995.  Not a gusher in the bunch, which brings the appearance up to a 4.  The fresh bottle was full of molasses, caramel, grape, apple, brown sugar, and cotton candy on the nose, with a thick sticky texture, lively carbonation.  Quite sweet with a bit of heat and some doughy yeast character.  If this was all this beer could be I doubt Id return to it.  The 2005 poured darker, flat, murky, and full of particulate matter.  The sweetness was more restrained, though it had a surprising hop presence.  Lots of honey and brown sugar, but also some prunes, soy sauce, and cardboard -- at this point, it tastes like a good, old beer that is a bit over the hill.  The 1995 bottle is just way too old.  Undrinkable beyond a few sips, and Im not going to let it influence the ratings here.

  The 2009 ... wow.  This is the sweet spot, and if I were rating on this sample alone this would be an easy 4.3+.  Average, fizzy head.  Clear, sparkling light amber pour.  Everything in this version just gels -- the over the top sweetness has now been cut back, kept in check by whatever it is that dries out old beers after a few years, but the cardboard/stale hops/prune flavors are nowhere to be found.  Sherry, grapes, apple, some honey ... it all just melds together beautifully.  

  Its unreasonable to say that *all* beer should be consumed fresh (even if most of it really should).  On the flip side, its even more unreasonable to say that *many* beers benefit from age.  On balance, I tend to lean closer to the former perspective than I do to the latter, but beers like this one serve as a glaring counterexample to the ""fresh is always best"" camp.  At 5 years old, this one was nearly magical.  I could see how a person could get caught up in chasing this kind of alchemy.

  Im updating the rating to reflect the range of experiences Ive had with this.  If I only ever drank it at 5 years old, itd be 4.3 or higher.  If I only drank it fresh, or when it gushed, or when it was too old, that could drop as low as 3.7.  4 seems like it hits the (weighted average) alright.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

Pours a brilliantly clear medium brown, at least until I got down to the bottom of the bottle and all the chunks came out, with a one finger white head. Really great head retention.

The aroma is loaded with dark fruits and has a really nice sherried quality. There is some spicy yeastiness along with a touch of vanilla and cherrywood. Very fruity all around.

The flavor is nearly all cherry up front but the other flavors follow quickly behind. More dark fruit supports the cherry along with a slight bit of oxidation. Vanilla and wood undertones along with ever-present alcohol letting you know that you are drinking a very hefty brew. Bitterness is very low with really no hop character to speak of. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth with some light warming after the finish.

Overall, I really love this beer. I wish I had a fresh one to compare but I imagine that age has done wonders on this as it is so smooth. The greatest think is it was already five years old when I bought it for $5. Truly a steal.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

Sweet caramel, citrus fruits, spices and wonderful hoppy (but not overly bitter or astringent) finish and some light alcohol. Amazing velvety and oily mouthfeel.

2317,"2013-10-27",3.7,"Bottled in 2012.
Appearance: The body is an opaque amber to orange hue with a tall and dense light tan head that has good retention, maintaining its shape for a minute or so.
Aroma: The aroma is fruity and leans sweet. Ripened strawberry and apple cider comes to mind, theres a mild dough presence and a touch of phenolic black pepper. The aroma masks the 12% near perfectly, I only get a hint of it. This almost smells wine like.
Taste: A bold fruitiness is on the intro, very sweet red wine like, while strong caramel and brown toffee back it. The flavor picks up some black pepper which overlies banana and hints of bubblegum. The finish is a bit dry and lingers with a touch of alcohol and black pepper, almost tannin like too.
Palate: Thick and moderately carbonated.
Overall: This is a complex beer that leaves me believing Im missing out on a lot here. I find this enjoyable, it reminds me of wine in a way. I recommend this, its a worthy buy if youre up for a big fruity Belgian!","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Pours a cloudy dull yellow to tan.  Active off-white head sticks around for several minutes and settles to a 1/2cm foamy cap, sticks to glass.

Aroma is Belgian earth bready yeast, with something more; spicy pepper maybe or candied fruit or something.

Mouthfeel is medium and is bit creamy, if only from remaining head.  A bit boozy.

Taste is interesting.  Front end is alcohol bite and bitterness, balanced with some sweetness.  Resolves to spices.  Possibly in the ballpark of the Struise Tsjeeses I drank yesterday.  And similar to that it is improving greatly as it warms up, flavors are blended better and not as distinct.  The bottom half of the glass is tastier than the top half.

2317,"2012-12-28",5.0,"Nous voici encore devant une bière dexception, mais serons-nous étonnés ???
Dune part parce que nous sommes en Belgique (hum, hum...) et dautre part 
parce que nous sommes chez les Dolle Brouwers  Ces brasseurs devraient être
qualifiés de sorciers. Et nous allons le démontrer.
Petit « a parte » en guise dintroduction, les bières de Noël sont vraiment un genre à
part entière, parce quelles démontrent la volonté dun brasseur déterminé de laisser
libre court à son imagination pour proposer un produit inhabituel dans sa gamme, 
et surtout aussi elles sont un phénomène social par lesprit de fête qui anime chacun
à cette époque de lannée, et la volonté dès lors dessayer un produit dexception...
Donc pour résumer simplement : « soyons fous, et fêtons Noël avec une bière de
derrière les fagots ».
Si les particuliers gardent rarement maintenant des bières en cave pour en faire une sorte
de bière particulière (sans jeu de mots), il faut donc pouvoir se procurer dans le 
commerce une bière travaillée de façon un peu « folle ».
Nous tombons très bien avec les « dolle » brouwers, puisquils sont fous...(par le nom,
je précise, pour ceux qui ne connaîtraient pas le néerlandais, quelle erreur!).
De plus, nous sommes ce soir la nuit de la pleine lune et le jour des Saints Innocents,
donc cest la totale pour vous faire ce commentaire sur la Stille Nacht (la Douce Nuit).
Un ami du Mexique (cest tout près de la Belgique) ma mis leau à la bouche en
me racontant quil avait dégusté une Stille Nacht pour la nuit de Noël, ce qui est la 
meilleure idée qui soit, et jai donc voulu le suivre sans tarder et pour une circonstance adaptée et
faire mon commentaire sur cette bière dexception.
Dabord et avant tout nous avons une étiquette de type psychédélique, nous dirons à la 
Janis Joplin, avec un bonhomme de neige qui nous présente ses vux en néerlandais.
Nous len remercions et surtout de nous afficher par la même occasion un degré abv
de 12 %.... Merci mon bonhomme (et reviens quand tu veux ).
La capsule indique un embouteillage en 2011 pour mon exemplaire. Nous avons donc
une petite année de réflexion dans le flacon...
Et surtout nous avons une autre mention très intéressante sur létiquette du bonhomme
qui nous dit « bière au goût évolutif ». Cest peut-être une litote, mais il nest pas inutile 
de le rappeler, une bière évolue dans son flacon, parce que tout simplement elle est un
produit vivant... Donc, elle évolue, tout comme nous  (merci!).
Après ces précautions oratoires, nous allons nous décider à verser le breuvage dans un
verre calice (sil vous plaît, merci....).
La couleur est dun ambre roux très joli. La clarté est nette, sauf quelques particules
de levure, qui témoignent déjà de son année de cave au calme.
Mais surtout, surtout, nous avons une myriade de bulles dune finesse extrême et qui
montent dans le verre, comme si elles émanaient dune fontaine en ébullition...
Cest super joli, et cest surtout le gage dune grande bière.
La mousse est dun blanc cassé qui nappe le breuvage de 2 mm de crème pure....
Les arômes sont de céréales avec du candi, de la réglisse, des raisins secs, de la prune,
de la poire et une pointe de noisette. (Si jai oublié quelque chose, vous me le dites )
Après le nez, plaçons-y les lèvres (on ne demande que cela ), et nous découvrons
une texture tout ce quil y a de soyeux.
Lentrée en matière est pimentée avec un rien de poivre (ce qui est normal dans le cadre
de Noël), mais aussi avec une pointe de genièvre (un alcool de chez nous, imité ici à la 
perfection). Cest un début très soigné, avec une arrière-bouche de céréales.
La 2ème bouche est sur une sorte de single malt whisky, ou il y aurait des céréales et de
la levure. La 3ème bouche va déjà apporter la chaleur tout en gardant des nuances pimentées,
avec un zeste dorange, des clémentines de Corse et une pointe de pamplemousse rose.
La longueur est impressionnante, avec des enchaînements « very amazing » comme dit mon
ami mexicain. La levure est remarquable, très douce, et pourtant bien marquée (ce que lon
appellera une levure au potentiel plus plus )
La finale est ample et pourtant pointue, je dirais quelle est vaste.
Lalcool est généreux et évolutif (comme le goût de la bière, dont nous avons parlé).
Il faut boire cette bière entre le tempéré et le degré de cave.
En conclusion, une bière exceptionnelle à déguster à chaque pleine lune, comme moi ce 
soir, et puisquelle évolue (sic), après 30 pleines lunes, vous êtes ronds comme la lune....
Plus sérieusement, un savoir-faire maîtrisé, original et catégorique.  5.  Cest peu dire...","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

Not sure if this tops Dulle Teve, or Oerbier, but its a wonderful beer. Maybe a perfect example of what an belgian barleywine sould be. The malt use is a masterpiece. The palate shows signs of residual sugar but its all logic. The overall of this brew sould be at least, in the 90+

Small 33ml brown bottle, this is the 12% version, so may not follow others reviews, poured into a Hoegaarden Grand Cru large tulip glass. 

Impressive slightly off white, huge head, which hung around for some time. The head sat on a almost hazy yellow body of liquid. Although this is classed as a dark ale, it is fairly light in appearance, even if you allow the sediment to get into your glass. 

Aroma of sour yeast, citrus fruits, strong and heavy, with vanilla and bannanas in the mix somewhere too. 

Taste is both bitter and sour, tart with a fizzy yeasty flavour which gives the beer an overall pleasing, refreshing feel to it. 

The flavours stay in the mouth for a while, giving this beer a good strong mouthfeel, the yeast flavour stays the longest, leaving a bitter, truely yeasty taste in your mouth, at 12% you would expect it to hang around in the mouth though, wouldnt you?

This might be too sweet for me, and it has a high alchool presence. High cellaring potential. [Edit: Had this one aged about 2 years. Pretty much the same rating, but with some port notes, and oxydated a bit. Fruity. Full bodied, low carbonation. Not changing score, this is pretty much the same, too sweet for me. (8/4/7/3/15)] [Second edit: Had a bottle from around 1995 (exact date not know). Quite different from other bottles Ive had, as I was told there was another yeast involved in there. Pours amber/deep golden with medium light-beige head. Aroma is of fruits, bretts. Taste is of fruits, sugar, bretts, alcohol, very slight cardboard, hints of madeira. Palate: Full bodied.

NOTE: Early 2015, we tried a bottle from the mid-90 (exact bottling date is unknown), thanks to Mathieuc! Brettanomyces have developped nicely to make this sugar bomb (when young) quite easy to drink. There was also a superb Rodenbach-like fruitiness, winey notes and some Madeira that suits the beer profile quite well. The only downside was the cardboard presence that wasnt too disturbing, but definitely noticeable. [8-4-8-3-16 = 3.9]","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

2317,"2011-10-03",3.7,"Porting this review from BA.

Appearance:
First off, let me say that this is HEADY. I havent even poured the whole bottle yet. Ive got just over 4 fingers of head here, just waiting for it to simmer down so I can pour the rest.
The color is more or less the same as a mango juice, but slightly less opaque. Hazy for sure, with little yeasties floating around.

Smell:
Bananas and cloves all around. Slightly spicy on top of that, with some orang citrus lingering around in there too. A pretty well-balanced aroma if you ask me.

Taste:
Gotta say, this doesnt taste anything like it smells. Citrusy, okay, but far more lemon flavor than orange. Some alcohol heat pierces the flavors as well. Belgian yeast is running all over the place, and some hints of sourness are there too. Extremely complex, and fairly difficult to describe in an appropriate order.

Mouthfeel:
Extremely high carbonation. So high that its hard to get a really good idea of what youre tasting at first. Other than that, medium body.

Overall:
I would put this on the ""good"" side of Belgian beers for me, which is significant, but because they arent normally my bag. Its definitely tasty, and I like the complexity. My only real complaint is the alcohol heat, making me think that I might have liked the 8% version more.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

The early 90s one was too far gone, same late 80s (worst one) & the 1999 didnt impress that much either. 1982 one was the best one??? Weird right, flavours really came really together there. The  yoghurt, fruit & white bread flavours really came together in the 1982, perfect oxidation. They were a bit too much to take in some of the earlier vintages, others they were really interesting. It is hard to put a rating to this beer. We are not talking about one consistent beer here but more like 10+ different one. Going to 4.5 because I have come to like the fresh ones more since I gave this one originally a 3.6, the 1982 was def. higher than 4.5 & the lesser older vintages can be pardoned, no matter what people say, 15+ years is not really the lifespan of a beer.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

It pours a deep reddish brow with a large rocky white head that leaves just a few spots of lacing.

The smell is sweet and seductive. Rich dark fruits dominate, it is reminiscent of a Belgian Quadrupel. It has the scent of red grapes, plums, dark cherries, and red delicious apple. There is a nice candied toffee scent and some spiciness as well.

This one is a sipper, whew. The first drink i quaffed a bit too much of it and it was overpowering. But all in all it is classic Quadrupel. It has layers of flavor starting with a nice bit of tart fruits, then going into a malty and dark bread middle, then it has a kick of fruitiness near the finish with some cherries, and it finishes with a waring alcoholic/sweet pungency. The flavor is soo rich. There is a big alcoholicness and sweetness, but the yeast provides a killer fruitiness that is just accented immensely by the alcohol and caramally sugar.

The mouthfeel is almost juicy, it is such a fruity beer that it reminds me of sparkling juice. It is a very nice mouthfeel actually.

This is an epic beer, I have seen it on the shelf for years now, I am glad I bought it finally.

2317,"2011-01-10",3.9,"Enjoyed from an 11.2oz bottle in a wine glass.  The beer pours a slightly hazy light amber color, with an essentially nonexistent head.  The nose shows an ester profile reminiscent of the Westmalle yeast strain; dark fruits, along with a slight continental malty note.  Alcohol is fairly prevalent, but forgivable in a beer with such a high gravity.  The palate absolutely shines, showing a slight bready malt note up front, dark and tropical fruit esters, and a depth adding alcohol presence.  Really amazing complexity.  The finish lingers, with more dark fruit esters, and a slight, but pleasing, residual malt sweetness, along with a tinge of alcohol.  Overall, a great example of the style; certainly living up to the hype surrounding De Dolle.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Soft pale malt embraced flavors of white wine, juicy fruitiness of oranges, apple tartness, pear, sultanas, prominent suggary sweetness, peppery spiciness, hoppy bitterness counteracting the sweet tones and warming alcoholic finish.

However, the taste is the crowning aspect (as it should be). I will say outright that I think that this beer is amazingly good. It is gentle but firm. Perhaps that is another way of saying that it is very well-balanced, but in any case, the whole spectrum of flavors is present here, while at the same time delivering a punch. A lot of winy flavors are present, along with a moderate sweetness. However, there is also a good Belgian hop flavor juxtaposed to the aforementioned flavors. A lot of Belgian yeast in there.

Nose and appearance are just sublime...deep copper w/ a nice lively look and head for a beer brewed over a decade ago. Nose is light tropical fruit, brown sugar and a hit of pleasantly funky raisin/prune. Taste is a little heavy om the candy sugar by this point, still has nice elements of spicy malt and a touch of bitter molasses, but, taste-wise, thus baby is a little past its prime. Glad to have had it, And still a wonderful creation from a fantastic brewer, but would say 11 years is a touch too long.","Littleton, Colorado, USA","alagnak"

This ale packs a wallop. Huge pale malt flavors, big fruitiness with the spiced apple and pear again. Incredibly sweet, the candy sugar is very apparent. Sweet buttery caramel and hints of vanilla and toffee. All of this is permeated by a distinct booziness that warms and kicks. Its not harsh but you know its there. Very sweet finish but the alcohol helps to dry that out a bit. Fantastic flavors but very, very strong and rough around the edges.

2317,"2010-06-03",3.1,"33 cl bottle from Bieropholie, served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass. 2009 vintage. Bottle NOV2009.
App.:  Deep orange-amber with many small, suspended flecks and a fairly large off-white rocky foam.
  
Aroma:  Its hard to describe the aromas...some tropical fruits, a fair bit of alcohol, all dominated by this oddly full, thick, savoury, slightly stank note, on swirling there are some very nice biscuity malts and fruitiness, Im not lovin this.
  
Palate:  Medium+ body with fairly assertive, full, rounded effervescence.
  
Flav.:  Very boozy fruits, tropical fruits, tree fruits, big alcohol sting, biscuits, yeast, orange peel and citrus, the indescribable note from the nose is all but gone, maybe cause the alcohol killed my senses; seriously sweet and very boozy with relatively high bitterness for a sticky Belgian and a fruity/malty/boozy finish.

2317,"2010-05-09",4.5,"Thanks to the generosity of a fellow beer geek, Jason, I am relishing each moment of a vintage 2004 De Dolle Still Nacht. A pinnacle Christmas beer, make sure to grab a few bottles so that you too can age your own.


As the sun descends slowly unto my glass, golden oranges shimmer with a tinge of haze beneath a miniscule head. Finally sporting a thin collar, I swirl her gorgeous depths to reveal not an iota of lace, but in return I am blessed with a bouquet of aromas so fresh, so rich, so moist that goosebumps race up my arms to stand at a point on the back of my neck. Spiced peaches, apricots, and mandarin oranges (no cans please) are long steeped in booze, spiced, moist, and chilled to suckling perfection. Her nose is light yet rich. Boozy yet gentle. Spiced yet subtle. Fruity yet dry. Orangecello steeps in the background while tutti-frutti whispers gently in my ear. Standing amidst a field damp with rain, her grains weighing heavily, their earthly effort taints the air which I relish with free abandon. Nature truly is beautiful. Add some freshly sliced pineapple, prickly skin included, and I am transported to nirvana where the beer flows freely and the skies are only as sunny as they choose to be that day. My first quaff is thick and rich, a pleasant reversal of fortunes when compared to her nose. Immediately coating my mouth with fruity booze and a dry finish, my thirst is nowhere near the least bit sated. Nay, in fact it is invigorated and eager to be set free. Permeating her palate are peaches, oranges, pineapple, and nectarines long steeped in a boozy mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon. Applesauce and orangecello mingle in the background while a long sweet honeycomb finish completes my first impressions. Almost immediately my being is enveloped in a warm embrace brought on by her selfless generosity. Further along my supping adventure, dry grass and brittle hay brushes her palate dry, creating an amazingly balanced touché of wet and dry, sweet and spiced, fruity and bitter, soothing and stimulating, all following a luscious path over, under, and through every fiber of my grateful being. Dont rush. Sip. Savor. Reminisce.


What her palate lacked in exuberant complexity, she more than made up for in amazing balance and harmony of opposites. Christmas only comes once a year, but if you save enough bottles of Still Nacht from De Dolle Brouwerij, you may enjoy many more Christmas when you so choose, realizing at the same time that the old adage of all good things come to those who wait has never been so true when supping an old Still Nacht.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Poured far too aggressively due to explosion. Really annoyed with that. Due  to the aggressive pour sediment appeared. Head is PERFECT. Damn awesome. Poured into ESB glass. 

Sediment is bobbling around in anarchy. A real shame. Aroma of marzepan; citrus and dried fruits. Awesome. Caramel; butterscotch, dried fruits and stringy doughy yeast. Excellent world class lacing. Awesome carbanation and drinkability is through the roof. This is such a good beer. I want to rate it higher but due to the sediment I am not. I love this De Dolle. Damn cant wait to have it on tap.

Flavor, candi sugar, yeast, some sweet tropical flavors; mango and sweet peach.
There is also a nice sweet floral/medicinal herb palate that becomes more present due to the high abv of this beer, offering a nice thick sugary coating on the palate.

2317,"2010-01-23",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 26, 2015 The aroma is lovely, dark and deep with the promise of honey, spices and caramel malt. Spiced mead comes to mind. The spice aromas are entirely without the cliched gingerbread houses of lesser winter beers and tend toward good, fruity peppercorns. The malt packs more fruit than a farmers market, as the beer chimes in with apricots, plums, grapes and bright, sweet lemons.  The malt flavor is fairly sweet, more rich than sugary, with big, dry Belgian yeast notes keeping things in check.

Tasting notes: Im quite surprised that this one was very quiet and didnt gush out of the bottle even after a little rough displacement. Clear, hazy amber color with a decent head that retains itself through the tasting. The aroma is slightly  sour but mainly sweet and sugary with a nice fresh smell of fruit, some orange. Flavor is mostly sweet but has a decent bitter finish in the end, quite fresh, fruity, big malt note that is especially noticable in the dry finish. Very easy drinkable, a bit too easy for its ABV. Decent carbonisation. I am very eager to see what the effect of more aging will be.

2317,"2009-07-09",3.8,"Original review date 3/15/2009...

11.6 oz. with a bottle date 2008. Visible floaties in the bottle. Out of the fridge and warming for about 15 minutes, then opened - not a gush with the cap off but its mildly happy to see me. I pour it off a bit into the Ommegang chalice, let it breathe and pour an additional amount.

Well, it has a classic eggshell-colored head...pouring carefully I get a full finger and then some. Its so thick its almost doughy and can see it jiggle like my beer gut when I type. There are a fair amount of floaties in the honey-copper body - as I was rather careful with this one its slightly aesthetically unpleasant. This is viscous. Looks like spent peanut oil in a deep fryer, its so thick.

The yeast is this is nice and electric with a slight...actually a moderate, sour tinge of citrus and mildly peppery spice. The grain profile is bright - not stewy or husky at all. No sense of burn - a little bit of saltiness, carbonation and mild coriander. LOTS of zest - both orange and lemon.

Theres a little bit of metallic barnyard taste here - maybe not hay and horseblanket but maybe a rusty nail that the horse brushed up against - hopefully he or she didnt get hurt. That light grain huskiness shows up here though and adds to the orange zest quotient and the huge yeastiness. Maybe not the most pristine Belgian Ive come across but its fairly complex. So thick the residual sweetness is from a light dose of maybe candi sugar and a bit of booziness. Carbonation lightens it up a little to keep it clean. Gets more velvety with warmth.

All this needs is a few minutes and it mellows out a bit to be fairly clean, quite husky and even a little on the heavy side. It blankets the palate and the back of the throat to be rather soothing - the booze burns but its wrapped in thick viscous liquid and slight residual sugar to keep it tolerable.

Hey, it ends up being a little on the heavy side but the complexity acquits itself nicely. Maybe something I wont reach for every day but a well-done effort nonetheless. Good change-up.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

The first pour didnt pull any of the sediment into my glass. The aroma is a smooth blended mixture of cherries, apples, raisins and then dark grapes. Wow, simply amazing flavor. It begins with a solid pulse of raisins, cherries and apples before a wave of brown sugar, faint toffee and a bit of sweet unfermented honey crashes in. The sugar sweetness approaches a creamy sensation as it mixes with persistent notes of dark grape jam and cherry compote.

Maybe I just got used to it.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a medium to dark, brownish orange (the color of an old penny almost) with a large, slightly off-white head that kept a thick sheet and left excellent lacing in a thick coat. The aroma was light to moderate cookie, light hops, light to moderate yeast, sour apple, candi sugar, and more sour fruit. The flavor started rather sweet and acidic, and finished sweeter, acidic and a little sour with an average to long duration. There was candi sugar, sour fruit, a little hops and a lot of yeast, some grain. Nice balance. The medium to full body was a little syrupy, but also creamy then dry with a sort of fizzy carbonation and a moderate alcoholic and light to moderate astringent finish.

Nose is a mix of hoppy fruit (apples?), maltydark fruit and a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is very full, dry and tingly. The flavor picks up the fruity hops from the nose, but also adds in a touch of malty sweetness and just a perfect amount of alcohol to fuse the hops and malts. Finish was surprisingly dry, yet sweeet, and the alcohol created just the right warming effect.

2317,"2008-12-22",3.8,"33cl bottle. Pours an extremely cloudy, opaque (kind of grody) caramel brown with chunky sediment drifting about (very hard to pour w/out getting sediment - lots and lots of it that is easily loosed from the bottom of the bottle). The aroma is intense at first: alcohol and spices (pepper, coriander). Dried fruit and hints of malt and sherry emerge. Flavor starts sweet and malty with toffee, caramel, and candied fruit. A very nice, toasty, bready, malt-sweet quality persists throughout. There are subtle spice notes on the front of the palate and a slight wine-like quality towards mid-palate - from acidity and alcohol. The finish is dry and quite spritzy with some malt sweetness, subtle spice and acidity, and De Dolle house yeast character (recognizable malt/ester profile from some of their other beers). The beer is warming as it goes down from the alcohol. The mouthfeel is very, very highly carbonated, but somehow it doesnt feel overcarbonated or inappropriate. It is spritzy and champagne-like but with a distinctly fuller body that begins to get chewy as the carbon dioxide is released. Overall - a tasty Belgian ale. The alcohol is very well-hidden. The chewy malts are delicious. I wish the beer were prettier though...","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Nose is apricot and tropical fruits, some yeast, floral. Taste starts off with a big dose of tropical fruit and apricots, with a bit of candy sugar in there also, but balanced by a nice combination of dry, spicy yeast, and a floral hop presence underneath. Mouthfeel is a big, sharp, dry carbonation, almost exploding in your mouth - dryness is welcome, but the carbonation is just a bit aggressive for me. Definitely a sipper, but one I would buy again without hesitation. I have never been disappointed with a de Dolle beer.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","JohnQPublic"

Rich orange, small head. Cold, not much aroma, some clove. Simple malty taste. Lively carbonation. Apple and loads of pear in the taste and retronasally. Finish, however, has a clear freshly popped popcorn flavour. Late finish is grainier, and a touch nutty. Quite pleasant, but I do not think they can justify the 12%.

Looks marmaladey, clearish, brief small head. Not even a hint of gushing. Marmaladey aroma, some tingly bite and red berry sharpness. Lovely aged raisiny taste, walnutty, a little woody. Lots of marmalade in the finish. And I mean *lots*. No hint of alcohol in the taste. Beautifully well attenuated from the extra years in the bottle. No stickiness. So much better than when young.

Aroma of soft peach and nectarine, with notes of fine sugar and candy.  Upon first sip, I have fallen in love with how unique and flavorful this beer is.  I have never had anything quite like it.  Stille Nacht is a sensory experience, with an intense aroma, flavor and even fizzy sound.  I tasted bubble gum, sweet peach, apricot, and perhaps even some perfectly crisped crème brule.

Strong aroma of fresh squeezed pineapple-orange juice, with some rich vanilla and a touch of alcohol, very juicy.   Medium/full creamy mouthful with lots of very fine sizzling carbonation, actually kind of sticky/sugary.   Sweet juicy first taste with a very noticeable taste of alcohol.   Flavors of orange and pineapple, some bitter fruity yeast, finishes a bit metallic with lingering alcohol.   I love the juiciness of the dry hopping and candi sugars, however I wish the alcohol was kept a bit more in check since there isnt any toasty/nutty flavors to cover it up.  So juicy.

2317,"2008-10-08",3.4,"2005 Bottle opened for sharing.
Opened with a strong hiss and nice esters however the carbonation was low - poured with almost no head at all.
Looked attractive with a orange hued beer with lots of yeast
Nose included lots of sweet fruits like ripe pears, yeasty notes, caramel like notes along with some peppery spices and a touch of tang. Impressively the big alcohol is hidden well
Taste: Lots of the sweet esters in the nose show up the sugary sweetness wants to overpower the other esters.
Palate: Felt thin on the palate the lingering notes were briefly peppery and like pears before yielding to the residual sweetness.
Overall: I was a little let down I guess I had too many expectations... not a fair way to judge a beer I suppose. This one (maybe the bottle I had) came across more like an English Barleywine in all characteristics from nose to high FG than anything like a Belgian Strong Ale.","USA","luvcasks"

Some bitterness too, and it has a pleasant warmth from the alcohol. Really effervescent in the mouth, full-bodied and slighlty sticky. Really lovely, the kind of beer I could drink everyday without getting tired of it. Rating: 8-4-8-4-17-4.1. (080823)Bottle, 2006 vintage. Its more or less the same aromas and flavors as described in my 2008 rating, but smoother. Flavors and aromas more integrated than in a fresher bottle, and the sourness seems to be at the same level. Dried fruits and fortified wine also springs to mind. Appearance-wise I have to mention the lacings, they are gorgeous looking and doesnt sink at all. Ive deducted points for the alcohol being a bit more evident in aroma, and on the palate, than I would prefer. And of course to have the possibility to rate an even better beer higher. A true classic, certainly a beer to seek out if you haven¨t been there yet. Cheers! Rating: 8-5-9-4-18-4.4. 091224Sometimes youre in the mood for  a beer, sometimes youre in the mood for THE beer. The beer is Stille Nacht from De Dolle Brouwers. I have been dreaming of a more tasteful and wonderful beer, but every time it turns out Ive been dreaming. Normally I wait until Christmas time until I pop the cork of a Stille Nacht, but sometimes, in the cold Norwegian autumns or springs, a SN saves the day. Or night. Its a beer so tasteful and pleasant smelling that I dont need another one. The light, considering its 12% ABV, alcohol impact is just adding joy to the experience. The mouthfeel is wonderful, warming, silky and full-bodied. The flavor so complex and fantastic Im lost for words. Anyway, the beer is just f...ing wonderful, especially after a few years in the cellar. Let me finish my beer, and a lot of the same kind, and Ill die a happy drinker. Damn, Im in love!

2317,"2008-08-29",4.1,"bottle into wine glass for lack of tulip/snifter/trappist glass.  Very active carbonation... the first pour was 75 percent head.

Aroma of Belgian candi sugar, wheat, yeast, coriander, delicate alcohol, and pale malt.  Lots going on in the flavor, and not in an overly flavorful/sweet syrupy or confused way - candi sugar, yeast, hops, plums, cherries, pale malt and more.  There is a definite alcohol presence, but it is complex and delicious and warm, not biting and nauseating.  I am not a huge fan of many belgians because I am not into super carbonated brews, but with a swirl or two this gy offers enough to tickle the tongue yet go down silky smooth with a medium to heavy body.

They werent kidding that this is one of the highest densities for a Belgian.  Unfortunately, with that density comes a rather cloying component.  In fact, the more I drink of this the more cloying this becomes.  On the flip-side, this does display some nice vinuous notes on the finish.  A bit of cab, tannins, some nice complexity.  Very odd.

It hits you right away (along with the high carbonation), and while the flavor of the beer is strong enough (and good enough) to power through it, theres quite a bit of alcohol burn, here.

Created a huge development of foam that was not easily containable once poured, it practically overflowed out of the bottle and from the edge of my glass cup.

In the nose a decent proportion of spicy yeast is detected but is somewhat mild and the alcohol is almost non existent.

2317,"2008-03-05",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 24, 2008 As originally reviewed on 3/16/07:

""Specbrew2005"" vintage

A big breakaway from previous Still Nachts, the ""Specbrew2005"" moniker found on the cap designates the first vintage using a more alcohol tolerant, attenuant, and slightly lactic yeast. The alcohol level has been boosted significantly, and the beer has become much drier and more complex. Gone is the cloying sweetness from the past, and drinkability is through the roof, limited only by availability and your wallet.

Pours dark gold, hazy, with fine particulates in suspension.
Significant sediment left behind in the bottle as well.
Off-white, tight head rises modestly upon a carefull, angled pour.
Head retention is minimal with all but edging and a center whisp remaining after 2 minutes.
Color is noticably lighter than the standard Stille Nacht, hinting at a more attenuated density.
Nose is Flandersesque, with residaul sweetness, but not overwhelming in either aspect.
Honey and some mild mulled apple notes work well with a highly phenolic profile.
Aromatics finish warming with light spice notes, coriander, orange blossoms, and dried cherries.
On the thick side of medium bodied, slightly syrupy and quite sticky. Carbonation is lightish, but enough to add some crispness.
Pallet is hugely Belgian, loads of fruit candy-like essense and honey. Alcohol is significant but not hot. Bitterness is right on, smooth and balancing.
A myriad of fruit mingles with juicy malt and rum-soaked bubblegum.
Pallet finishes long and warming on the back of the toungue, with none of the cloying residuals of the previous Stille Nachts.
A stronger, drier, more complex and drinkable version.
Extensive aging should be a real treat.

4/24/08 cellar check of ""Specbrew2005""

The carbonation seems a bit subdued, with a one-inch head at best with a long pour. 
Candied green apples making a stronger presence as this one ages.
The mouthfeel could use some carbonation to keep things lively.
Slightly dryer yet on the pallet, but still a fair amount of juicy malt and esters.
Alcohol is under the radar, and the beer drinks fast.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"

2317,"2008-03-01",2.9,"In short: Sweet/syrupy ripe fruit concentrate.  Just ok.
How: Many bottles, various aging.  This rating for a two year old bottle.
The look: Very cloudy dark-orange body with lots of particles.  Small white head.
In long: The main flavour is very syrupy sweet ripe fruit taste.  Something that reminds me of a cross between a can concentrated juice (before adding the three cans of water) and the liquid in canned fruits (Del Monte kind of stuff).  Cranberries, bananas, grapes, peaches, etc.  Just too syrupy.  A little milk chocolate and some candy sugar.  Lots of small bubbles.  Alcohol is somewhat apparent.  Cruelly lacking in hops.  Gets sickening after only a single little bottle.  I really wanted to like this beer as this is one of De Dolle highest rated beer, the dudes that make some of my favourite beers (arabier, oerbier, etc.).

Little to no head to speak of, a bit of orange fizz for a second but then melts into nothing. Taking a deep sniff reveals, plums, cherries, light spices, and tart cherries. Really nice blend of aromas they have going on here. Upon first sip I realized this is a beer that needs to be slowly sipped and respected. Very complex beer here. At first I get a wave of cinnamon and clove then tart cherries and deep prunes. Apricot and pears as well. Im really digging this fruity and tart blend with a hint of light spice. Very well made beer. I wish I had another one.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","rayg1"

There is some light spiciness that almost takes the mind off the heavy dose of alcohol and sweetness. Finish is medium, warming. Syrupy mouthfeel with some stickiness and very little carbonation.

The head was tight and displayed very nice retention, lasting the entire duration of the glass.  Some uneven, runny lace was left behind.  The aroma of the beer was made up of orange peel, candi sugar, raisins, light sourdough yeast esthers, and also some toffee.  The taste was similar, but also included notes of sweet and sour apples, cherries, and also some alcohol in the finish.  The mouthfeel was slightly creamy and full-bodied with very crisp, fizzy carbonation.  The combonation of the high alcohol content and the lively carbonation created a nice tingly warming effect on the tounge and throat.

Under that, theres some caramel, white wine and a slight hint of cookie dough.  Very strange.  Some pepper as it warms.  Initially, this tastes very sweet, with lots of caramel, sugar, white chocolate, and a whole bunch of sour apple and other such fruit flavors.  Some yeast pungentness gets through.  Plenty of hop flavor in the finish (toast, earth, nuts, etc.) which is a welcome touch.  Good flavor, but overall a very strange beer.

2317,"2007-08-30",3.9,"Cloudy, unfiltered golden amber appearance.  It practically glows in the glass when held to the light.  Small white head that settles to a neatly groomed edge with a wispy film.  No lacing at all.  The aroma shows lightly caramelized sugar that intensifies significantly with each additional degree of warmth.  I also picked up both light and dark fruits, including bananas, apricots, and figs. Some alcohol is detectable on the nose, though its not unpleasant.  The flavor profile starts with candy sugar and caramel, evolving to include figs, mild spices, and faint traces of muscat.  The palate is medium in substance, smooth and sweet.  The finish leaves a long sugary fig flavor on the tongue.  I really dig this beer!","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

I get a little bit of alcohol warmth up front, but it is very well balanced for being 12%. I think the hops have mellowed out with the age of this one. A full sticky mouthfeel that had a long finish to it with all the sweetness left on the palate. Really well balanced with the fruit and sweetness in this one that makes it easy to drink.

2317,"2007-06-26",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2007 Aged 3 - 5 years this is one of my favorite beers on earth.  Ive had it many times over the years, in the U.S. and in Belgium, in the bottle and on tap, fresh and aged.  There are variations over the years, but this is always a wonderfully complex, super rich, sweet and flavorful strong Belgian malt monster.  Fresh it can have an overly strong alcholol taste, not beautifully balanced like aged...but after 2 or 3 years it starts to mellow out with rich malts, sweet fruits like dates and raisins, caramel and cognac, oak and cane syrup.  Wonderful aroma of malts and sweet fruit; dark amber-orange color.  Comparative beers include aged (Swiss) Samichlaus and Thomas Hardys.  Whats bad is when you know it needs aging but you just cant wait, like Im doing now, drinking it too young, knowing its so much better later, but ooooh, its also so good now!","LA, California, USA","DenverLogan"

Pours a light amber color with little head, and microscopic cloud of white floaters if you look closely in the light.  Clean aroma of orange and some other fruitiness.   Wonderful mild sweet flavor, with the subtleness of orange peel bitterness in the finish.  Mild and spectacular. I would describe it as a grande fermented orange.  Alchohol is well hidden.  I love it.  Good by itself, or with anything.  Must buy more for storage and special events.  I know Im rating it much higher than others and I dont care.

1/10/07:  Tried again a Churchills side-by-side with the reserva after trying a darkness.  The Darkness was much, much better.

2317,"2007-06-22",4.3,"2006 bottle. A gusher. Lost a few ounces before it got it to the glass. Once in, hazy apricot with a huge layer of frothy milk white head, settling in sticky lumps. Rich, stewed fruit aroma, mint, menthol, pears. Alcohol vapor is very present, but in a rather alluring, concentrated way--like whisky. That translates in a pretty direct way to the flavor: the strength is quite apparent, but the flavor concentration is equally strong. Leathery dried fruit, a nice full bitter bite. Yeasty, herbal. Very bright, but not aggressively bubbly. (Apart from the initial bottle opening.) This continued to get more interesting as it warmed, even starting from just barely cool. A sipping beer.

The aroma was sweet, smelled like candy, had a very definitive dry vinous grape smell, exhibited noticeable wine characteristics, tart sharp acidic smell. The flavor was very sharp, warming from the alcohol, tasted like a dry white wine, a slight hopped character, sweetness, didnt really have the typical belgian earthiness, very sharp and acidic.

Bathing the drinker in brandied bread-pudding, with golden raisins, spicy fig sauce, Australian cheddar, and an earthly delight of piquant yeast, bread crust and cracker. The voluminous silk foam sits atop a mildly hazed golden-amber liquor, percolating nicely. Explosive in the mouth, with an airy perfume of carbonation, shattering a cascade of perfect pale flavors throughout. Apple, cognac, watered down lychees and herbal citrus marinades, fresh and garden variety. Slightly warm and full of esters bordering on medicinal, yet staying this side of overbearing. Phenomenal texture with an evaporative quality, and a lingering pungent dryness that carries the smidgen of hops through with a bit of apple skin and grape seed.

Enormous, generous nose: honey, dried fruits, lightly toasted oak and wood; just dense, viscous, restrained malty sweetness; nowhere near as sweet as when fresh; well-integrated dry caramel presence from the oxidation, but even this seems alive; hints of apples and alcohol at the edges.  Full mouthfeel: gorgeous balance between the dry caramel notes, dense dried fruits and honey, and the balancing presence of the acidity; gorgeous presence in the mouth, such that I went through this like pilsener; layer upon layers of stacked honeyed maltiness, brown sugar, and cotton candy, with sweet caramel at the perimeter; lively carbonation; soft edges; a beautifully aged beer.

2317,"2007-05-13",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 23, 2007 This is a difficult beer to rate, as different bottlings yield drastically different results.  Three different years:

2004 - Nice, rich flavor, dominated by sweet apples.  Pleasant, but not very complex and quite sweet.

2005 - Hazy apricot pour, sometimes with a massive head.  God, it is so soft and chewy, it is just to die for.  Red wine, apples, oak, vanilla, caramel, banana, pear, candy sugar, AMAZING.  Rich, creamy, smooth, haunting.  Profoundly majestic and almost perfect.

2006 - Has some characteristics of the 2005 but the bottle I had was thin and overly carbonated.  Lost alot on these merits, as the 2005s mouthfeel was so much of what made it beautiful.  Hopefully, it will improve with some age.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
2317,"2007-05-08",3.7,"Sticky sugar and alcohol.  Light fruity peach flavor counteracted by dense candi sugar.  Very well hidden alcohol considering the abv.

Flavor is lightly sweet with dates and plums, molasses and apples.  There is a fair amount of complexity to this one and I had a tough time placing all the flavors, I also noted caramel but I may have been stretching since I cant really recall that flavor now.

2317,"2007-04-26",4.4,"Bottle, 1996 vintage, at the Kulminator, Antwerp.  Beautiful amber with a two-finger, big-bubbled white head.  Huge bouquet here in the nose - very malt-centric and almost reminiscent of a barleywine, no doubt because of its age.  Toffee, caramel are the main components as well as a slight spice presence in clove and maybe even some citrus. It has a sweetness that, again, reminds of good barleywines as well as a slight alcohol note.  Taste is a lesson in balance - definitely a testament to the age on this one.  Assertive malt is rounded off by a dark fruitiness, spiked with spice notes and a very slight alcohol.  Caramel, toffee, but light and fragrant instead of cloying and overwhelming - sweet but not annoyingly so. Slight sour note in the finish, with a sweet and long lingering aftertaste. Very, very slight metallic component as it warms. The palate here is really interesting and shows the most change because of the 10+ years of age on this one.  It still retains high carbonation but is very delicate and light on the tongue - the beer has definitely thinned out in the cellar, but the thinning is pleasurable and interesting instead of rendering the brew insipid or watery.  This is really good - a day after the Westys, still this is nothing like Ive ever experienced.","Ithaca, New York, USA","dmradus"

Like a creamsickle flavored barleywine, only well done, and not as shitty as that sounds.  Well balanced.  On the palate this is thick and sticky.  a real sipper.  Some alcohol burn.  A bit of that Belgian funk comes in fairly strong although its over a big ass alcohol, orange, and herbal front.  This balances some very big sweetness, though the caramel is less so present.  Some major diacetyl, but here it works.  I mean, this is just a wall of fucking flavor.  Maybe a hint of coriander.

2317,"2007-04-07",4.0,"The aroma was sweet candy and a light bit of DMS (corn) character. Alcohol wafted from the dense head, and as the head fell a nice caramel presence emerged. Light Belgian spice filled the aroma as did just a hint of diacetyl. The beer poured into the Oerbier tulip golden with some particulates and a white frothy head that retreated slowly and laced the glass. The flavor was malty and fruity and well done. The fruit was exotic and had mango and papaya with some green raisins. The flavor had a sweet nature which was candy and caramel, but was nipped in the bud by alcohol and a substantial enough bittering and alcohol presence to steer the direction of the beer toward dry. Some well achieved Belgian yeast spice presence was notable as well. The finish was dry with lasting Belgian yeast spice and fruit character long and pleasantly into the aftertaste and beyond. The body was medium full and with the high carbonation was a bit creamy in the mouthfeel. The alcohol presence after consumption was extremely high and although the finish was dry the sweet impression lasted for days.

Ill rate the 2004 vintage. I find a like champagne smell, with orange and vanilla, where I used to find chocolate, dark fruits, dates, prunes and honey.
In the mouth, I notice sherry wine, oranges, coriander, hints of something like clove or maybe cardamom, caramel, peachs and vanilla. I used to notice ind the dark versions raisins, chocolate, honey, and it was so think that reminded me of a cake.

The taste begins with thick candied malt that is joined by vineous traits and smooth nectar fruits.  The sharpness from the carbonation offsets and compliments the thick smoothness of the flavors.  The finish intensifies the carbonation and the alcohol becomes more pronounced, but still doesnt seem like it is 12%.  There is also some sharper light fruit tastes and a spicy bite on the finish.

The aroma is musty yeast, sharp cidery apples, oak and alcohol.

The flavor is sweet and sugary malts with fruits and alcohol and a decent bitter finish that helps balance things out.  The mouthfeel is full and velvety.

The flavor is quite sweet, and very complex, with notes of fruit syrup containing oranges, peaches, and a bit of prunes, as well as a spicy note of cinnamon and cloves, soon after the very smooth and fruity start, the alcohol makes its presence know by a warming fealing, which grows just a bit in intensity and burns slightly in the long lasting after taste.

The taste is pretty good.  A lot of the the same flavors translate over.  The alcohol was present in the taste, but it is 12% so that is somewhat expected. I had a year old bottle of this beer and it was still fairly carbonated in the mouthfeel.  Overall a pretty good beer.  I can only imagine what the reserva edition would taste like after letting this beer sit for over a year in boeurdaux (sp?) barrels.

Rerate:  1987 Vintage  What a different beer than any of the more recent vintages of this beer.  Not much carbonation, but still a little bit present in the pour...but I wouldnt expect much carbonation from a beer over 20 years old.  Much darker in color...more along the lines of a reddish wine color than the yellow color of more recent years.  Aroma of sweetness, fruits, grapes, and sugars.  A little bit of sourness that is certainly welcome within this beer.  This beer is remarkably reminiscent of a port wine or red wine melded with a great belgian strong ale.  Fantastic Brew!!!!  Thanks Mike!","Green, Ohio, USA","LeopoldStoch"
2317,"2006-07-17",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2014 2002 bottle sampled July 2006.
The cap pops off with a substantial whoosh. The beer pours orange amber with a great big though short-lived low-density head. 
The aroma is complex: a barleywine fruitiness lays down the backbone with strong apple cider notes on top, even venturing in the direction of vinegar acidity. Pineapple and a hint of tangerine fill out the fruit flavors; leather and wood lend a certain sophistication to the nose; strong caramel hints at a sweet beer to follow with the first sip. Alcohol is abundant in the aroma, especially early on.

The flavor, four years in, is very nice. Somewhat sweet but not overly so, dark caramel and baked apples before the taste twists nicely and plenty early into well-hopped finish. Pepper and again some leather add interest midway, along with a cognac and golden raisins.
Unfortunately, the aggressive carbonation detracts from the mouthfeel, making this beer - which seems otherwise perfect for savoring on the tongue - hard to drink in that way. The alcohol is prominant; this one tastes every bit of its 12 percent ABV.

I came to this beer with high hopes, and Im not disappointed. It loses a few points on the palate especially, and I can guess that this one would be better aged a few years like mine was than it would be fresh. So I guess I better set a few aside in the cellar...

2005 bottle sampled December 2006. Splendid. While this might do well with additional age, theres nothing wrong with this at a year plus. This one is not so heavily carbonated as the previous sample, and the aroma is marvellously perfumy in addition to all of the description above. If anything Id rate this even higher; a 9/4/9/4/17=4.3 is not out of the question.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2317,"2006-07-10",4.2,"Bottle.  ""Special Brew"" bottle cap.  Orangeish pour with a head that didnt stick around.  The head did something really interesting.  I usually notice the way a head leaves a ring around the edge of the glass.  Instead this one pulled to the center and left a small dime size dot right in the middle of the glass and stayed there for the entire drink.  Very interesting indeed.  Aromas were a little hard to dectect.  My wine drinking buddy pretty much had the enitre area permeated with sour grapes that it was all I could smell.  But the flavor was outstanding.  Dark fruits and wood.  Alcohol and some sort of fruity spice.  Very good and very satisfing.  I really liked this one.","Santee/San Diego, California, USA","fordest"

A very well done Belgian strong ale that hits all the right notes.  If only   it werent so overpowering, it would be outstanding.  Perhaps with some years   on it this one will mellow in character.  Overall, one that everyone should   get a chance to try.

Aroma / Appearance - The first thing to hit my nose was an impression   of butterstotch, lemons, fresh orange peels, caramel and toffee.  There was   also a vinous alcoholic scent underlying everything.  The body was a wonderful   cloudy caramel color with traces of sediment lingering in the glass.  A sticky   lacing made it clear this would be a beer that held none of its alcoholic   punch back.

Flavor / Palate - The initial taste consisted of a combination of   caramel, toffee and a strong alcoholic bite.  Latter sips gave way to a   wonderful sweet butterscotch with citrusy undertones.  Somewhere towards the   middle of the glass semi-sweet dark chocolate appeared on the back on my   throat.  Overall, every sip revealed a new facet of the rich complexity   hidden in the glass.  The honeylike finish left me wishing there was a little   more although the consistant alcoholic bite made me glad the glass was   finally empty.  Still, this was excellent - if you can get your hands on this   one, buy two.  One to try immediately and another to age for a few years.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2317,"2006-06-09",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2013 Bordeaux-cask aged vintage from 1982 (which basically means this is 1982 Stille Nacht Reserva).
Consumed at Kulimator in May 2006  Deep purple colored body with a still white filmy head.  Very robust nose full of scotch, port and sherry, with notes of black cherry and old oak casks. Thickness and texture, while expected it to be huge, is silky, tannic and wine-like.  Rich, silky, oily, resinous... PERFECT palate. Was told that this was the favorite beer of Dirk Van Dyck, who runs Kulminator, and I can see why.

2317,"2006-06-06",4.6,"Vintage 1982 - Very dark brown body, big bubbled light brown head disappearing quite fast; This nose is big (not huge), very deep, but could be more complex (it is already very complex). The beer is old and the nose has a lot of aged character to it. Right when served,  dust is overshadowing almost everything else, but it unfolds beautifully with just a little time in the glass: lot of burnt caramel, mixed with all kinds of dried fruit, date, fig, prunes, but actually also fresh red fruits like strawberry and fresh sweet cherry. Great nose. I have had this beer before and do actually remember the nose even bigger (like HUGE); The beer only has very little carbonation and a nice oily texture, a little sourness that combined with a small amount of salt gives the body a very pleasant balance; that flows smoothly into a very long finish unfolding nicely, starting out very soft and sweet, but quickly gets a little fruity sour that balances the finish perfectly: dried and fresh fig is standing strong, overripe cherry, sweet overripe orange juice. Well this beer just goes on and on and is very, very great.","Aarhus, DENMARK","henrikb"

The alcohol was a tad hot, though, and there was an odd almost medicinal aspect to the aroma (but not the flavor). Fruity w/ some faint sourness, caramel malts. Good stuff, rating getting bumped a bit. Original rating: Sampled 2004 bottle. This one poured a dark amber-orange-brown color with a nice little head that settled to a thin covering that remained throughout. Lacing was decent. Aroma was spicey and sweet. The flavor, unfortunately was REALLY REALLY REALLY sweet (and I normally like sweet beers). The spices came across strong in the finishing flavors, almost at a hop level. This seemed almost like a triple attempt with a dark colored malty sweet base with the way it finished. The mouthfeel was really heavy: body contributed some to that, but even moreso the sugar and sweetness left the mouth feeling thick. I dunno, a bit overpriced and the other De Dolles Ive had (Extra Stout & Oerbier) were far superior.","","User37895"

Lots of candi on the nose, with a bit of red apple (closer to Red Delicious, say, than Gravenstein). The attack is fizzy and tart, which would usually turn me off more than most, but the softening of the years has served this beer beautifully. Its still intensely sugary, but theres fruity sourness in close association with the sweetness. The big cannon shots of fruit, white sugar, and acid harmonize, instead of stepping all over each other and leaving you feeling like youve been mauled. Theres a tiny whisper of hops, too, but nothings domineering or clamoring for attention.

The body was quite full with a smooth, soft carbonation and a slightly slick oily texture. The flavor bursts upon your taste buds with a fruity, soft sweetness initially.

I originally had this in a small bar in Ghent, and didnt like it the first time because it just was too flavorful.  However, a second tasting revealed more flavors and the warming satisfaction of a good Christmas brew.  Ive had a bottle aged well over a year, as well as fresher batches, and the aging does improve the palate, with a more consistent and well balanced flavor.  Also, something about the home made look of the bottle, with a crooked label and a plain white cap just seems to announce that it is a small batched masterpiece, and the contents follow through on that.","USA","kylelackner"

Upon opening the bottle, our immediate aroma is (quite simply) a box of raisins. In the glass, we find more of a spiced-hop-and-yeast presence with dry, woodsy-pine, faint bananas, exotics and low campfire-smoke. First taste screams, ""Yes, you fool... this is a Belgian Strong Ale!!!"" (followed by evil, maniacal laughter). Intense, Belgian candi sugar-sweetness is tempered by parching astringency through the obvious alcohol presence. Yeasts show with a touch of sourness, but cannot compete with the sweet. I feel the entire beer coating my brain with numbing alcohol then rushing to my gut to sit and burn awhile... all the while laughing at me from behind the mask of sugars. An excellent holiday brew, but more suited towards Halloween as this is a devilish Trick within a Treat.

Aftertaste is spicy with a hint of alcohol, but surprisingly not much considering its strength. Medium-bodied with a nice alcohol warming afterwords.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"

2317,"2006-01-13",4.5,"Had this at BJs Winter Ale Fest. The beer poured a murky, dark yellow color with a small, creamy, white, mostly diminishing head. The aroma was very complexI had trouble pulling my nose out of the glass before the next sample came around. It was composed of moderate malty notes of toasted grain, light hop notes of apricot and moderate yeast notes of cellar and bread dough. Miscellaneous aromas were plentiful and contained light peach, honey, candy sugar and lightly smokey peat. The flavor is heavily sweet and lightly bitter with an average-length, lightly sweet finish. The body was medium-to-full, the texture was syrupy and the carbonation was soft. The high ABV was well tucked away like a soft candle light.

2317,"2005-11-22",4.0,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler. This beer is definitely an ass kicker. Pours a fairly clear yellow color with a minimal head. Interesting banana aroma combined with an ominous punch of alcohol and the distinct aroma of fresh baked bread. The alcohol presence is felt more than tasted in this beer. I got  the sensation of warming on the first sip even though I served this beer at around 40 degrees. As the beer warms, I feel that the beer tastes like bananas drizzled with honey while the slight hint of hops keeps this beer from being too much.  The aforementioned flavors are complimented  with a slight cherry flavor that I dont usually expect from beers of this hue. Initially this beer is a shock on the palate. Extremely thick and syrupy with an instant alcohol sensation. As I adjust to this beer over time I find myself cursing De Dolle and their tendency to outprice me with fantastic beers that I would prefer to keep onhand year round. Unlike most De Dolle products I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not overcarbonated and actually went down rather smooth.

2317,"2005-11-04",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 16, 2007 Rerate 9/8/07:
This bottle is a 1996 vintage - a nice find! As soon as I opened it I got an incredibly potent whiff! I would have rated this beer highly by virtue of the smell alone: sweet potato pie, caramel, pineapple, lemon zest, along with more vage earth and wood scents.
Poured with a substantial, dense head (how can that be? the new beers dont have head) that faded quickly to a modest ring. Color is dark, caramel, red-brown. Tastes like a real christmas beer should, with green apple, caramel, raisins and funky earth flavors merge together like a port wine. The ageing really helped tame the disparity between the dense sweetnes and sour apple tang. Ageing also contributed to a more soft,, hazy mouthfeel. Mmmmm. HIghly recommended.

Poured kinda thick. Looks like caramel.
Very rich, sweet and tart. Reminds me of a caramel granny smith. 
Certainly a wintertime drink. Very drinkable despite its abundant flavor.Overall a very good, bold beer.","USA","jrt"

Very interesting aroma, reminiscent of a lambic blend or a sour brown.  The tartness is missed on the palate, overpowered by a syrupy sweetness.  Maple brown sugar flavor.  Im not getting the alcohol bite that others mention.  But that could be due to my tolerance  and preference for 100 proof bourbon.  Dessert beer, to be sure.

2317,"2005-10-02",3.0,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2007 Im proud to say Ive never been in a fight because of alcohol.  Until last night.  My French friend and I sat down for another pedantic beer review session.  It was a calm, autumn evening and the last light of the day was retreating out of the apartment.  Fine conditions for beer tasting indeed.  Everything seemed tranquil, almost deceptively so.  We uncapped the Still Nacht, poured it, looked at it, smelled it, wrote a few notes down, smelled it again, discussed the smell, made fun of the label and jotted down a few more lines.  Then we sipped it.
I still have a black eye.  The Still Nachts name is pure chicanery.  Theres nothing still about this beer, and theres certainly nothing calm about it either.  Its like wrestling with an irate grizzly bear, armed only with a nail file.  Before I elaborate on the shellacking this beer gave me Ill start with the relatively harmless color and smell.  The beer pours a  beautiful orange color, deep, emotional and pensive.  My friend pointed out that the yeast particles are held in stasis the beer owing to its surprising thickness.  One might believe it was a glass full of orange marmalade.  There were also some fun little yeast circles in the head, though Im reminded that yeast cant form any formations of their own volition.  The smell resembles the taste minus the great, bestial claw of alcohol.  Sweet and tangy orange come out first, followed by a little grape juice.  Here we come to the part where I take my first sip and fly out of my chair.  The alcohol is immense, it is angry and it hates me.  It screams and theres nothing the rest of the beer can do to silence it.  My ears bleed.  Seizures begin.  It is a cacophony of relentless pain and noise, noise, noise.  Finally the taste clears from my throat and Im red faced and back on my chair.  Commence the second sip, where Im a little more prepared.  Ive fashioned a crude harness of duct tape and couch foam to endure the impact and it works.  With all the attention Ive saved from not falling to the floor I can pick apart the flavors a little more.  I find mostly orange marmalade, akin to the color.  Most interesting to me was the rate at which the taste dissipates; a lovely decrescendo after a mighty clang of 12% alcohol inundation.  The fight was a little one-sided, and hobbling out of the kitchen I shake Still Nachts hand for being a good sport, and at least a unique beer.  However I think its a bit strong for my feeble tastes.  Everyone is talking about how they had this beer after several years of aging in a cool basement.  I only had it under my bed for a day.  Maybe thats the problem.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
2317,"2005-10-01",2.9,"Pours a syrupy thick orange marmalade with a  nearly non-existent bubbly head. Small lumps of yeast levitate in the glass validating the extremely high density of this brew. The nose is sweet with fruity notes reminding of white grapes, melon, orange and grapefruit. Some sour apples and Champagne mingle providing an acidic background. The first sip seems like drinking cough syrup or a cordial straight out of the bottle. The sticky cloying sweetness emphasizes oranges, corn syrup and more alcohol than I would ever want in a beer. Not sure how old the bottle was, but from what I can tell, it was probably a couple of years too young for me to drink. I want to believe this beer will get better with age but until Im proven wrong its as bad as the label.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

2317,"2005-08-25",3.7,"Vintage 2003
I had read a million times that this beer was very sweet and syrupy so I thought that some aging might do the trickUhhhhhhh NOPE 2 years in the cellar! The one thing that aging did do is relieve the alcohol heat and burn. 
 Pours a beautiful syrupy dark amber body with very little head. The aroma is largely sweet:  a mass of candied sugar and sweet bready malts, like drinking fresh wart. The flavor brings a mass of fruits, pears, red apple, plums, dates, maybe even some blackberry. The yeast isnt overly pungent a bit rustic, suggestions of leather and biscuit. It is almost overly sweet a nice woodsy smokiness from molasses but too much like pancake syrup. The palate is rather oily and especially sticky. A terrific nightcap for the very cold winter months. To bad Florida never really gets that cold. 
 Ill age another bottle. But this time Ill let it sit for a couple more years and see what happens Ill shoot for 5 this time.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

2317,"2005-08-17",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 27, 2007 8-21-2007: 1996 bottle, just bought today in NYC. This has likely been sitting in this unconditioned store for all 11 years. Bottle #1430. Pours a rather deep ruddy brown with a ton of yeast. There is a surprisingly large amount of carbonation and head still with this beer. Up front he nose is slightly sour, old, licorice. Licorice and tart sweetness really come through in the taste, lots of complex oxidized malts and pure fruit juices. Tartness is very nice, and evidence of Rodenbach from the yeast is slight but apparent. Remarkably complex, with elegent, balanced sweetness and acidity and a perfect body. This has aged BEAUTIFULLY.

Very full-bodied, syrupy, definitely warming - yet not burning palate, thanks to the high gravity and sweetness. An extreme beer, but a bit disappointing as the 6-year old vintage was not any better.

Color is a medium cloudy brown and even though the head was small thats forgivable since its a Belgian ale. It did leave some lacing though. Taste is complex and covers the gamut of flavors in most European ales. It is sweet, fruity, bitter, malty, acidic and high in alcohol. (Maybe a little too high since it comes off as way too bitter) It has that wonderful quality of tasting different at the start and finish. (more beer like to start, more wine like in the finish) In this ale I detect bananas, pears, and apricots. Aftertaste is a surprisingly good combination of a little smokiness matched with a beautiful sweet sangria wine that is hampered only by a biting bitterness. Almost perfect save the bitterness.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"

2317,"2005-02-08",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2008 This is an entirely different brew from the 2000 Reserve already rated.

The appearance is a lighter orange than either the standard Stille Nacht, or the 2000 Reserve. 

The nose is laden with cloves and bananas, with a light underrpinning of citrus. There is also a cedary/sandpapery note. The head is substantial, and longlasting, and there is a wonderful lace.

The body is chewy, but not so much as in the 2000, and certainly nowhere near a bottle of 96 I had the good fortune to try, recently.

The palate is banana and clove, with a strong mandarin orange/orange peel undertone, as well as a ""tight"" array of spices, which are ""holidaylike"" in nature, but difficult to delineate separately. There is DEFINITELy a stronger hop presence than I am used to in Stille Nacht, and also a sour dryness, and woodiness that is almost austere enough to put me in mind of Calvados. Perhaps it was aged in those casks, since that seems to be a trend, of late.

At any rate, this was a challenging, different flavor, but on the whole, a very rewarding one.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Caskalefan"

Grapes give it a wine like venious flavor and feel.  Supprised that there isnt much yeast flavor.  There is a sour, slightly alcholic wine finish.

huge aroma: fruity, malty, evidence of the alcohol content, a little woodsy-ness. pours a clear amber with beautiful lacing.  Flavor is simply excellent.  Maltiness is dominating, but the complexity of the malt notes, the addition of the yeasts characteristics.  excellent brew

second tasting: clear amber,  aroma is alcohol, malt, a little fruit...peach/apricot.  flavor is a wonderful blend of spice, alcohol, malt, and milt hop bitterness to offset the intense sweetness.  great

96 bottling:  completely different beer.  pours a cherry rose.  aroma is winier, but still figs and bread.  flavor is an explosion: tart, sweet, full.  the tartness dominates...i know there arent cherries in the beer, but it really tastes like there could be.  phenomenal.","San Francisco, California, USA","bombshelter"

This may be the beer and the year that I fell in love with Belgian beers!  Back then I got it mailed to my door from Johns Grocery...this beer was simply unlike anything I had ever imagined, as was Oerbier.  So how can I fault it now?  Overripe and fermenting fruits billow out of the glass followed by sweet maltose...after  6 years in the bottle, this puppy is still quite bubbly, although the inside of the bottlecap was black!  I think if you combine this beer and Oerbier reserva you get something like Speciaal Brouwsel?

This is one damn tasty beer. The mouthfeel is the first thing that I noticed. Its so damn soft and velvety and just seems to glide effortlessly across every taste bud, soak it and then leave. Numerous Fruits. Cherries and Raspberries first. Raisins next, then plums, now dried plums. Very sweet throughout. Cinnamon like spicyness after the fruits.

This beer has probably been brewed with the most candy sugar out of any beer I have every had. It is very very sweet and is very cloying on the finish.

2317,"2004-08-08",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2005 At the KULMINATOR in Antwerp. Outstanding bottle of Stille Nacht 1998. Old-golden color with warm dark-orange shine and extreemly fluffy head.

2317,"2004-07-03",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2008 Re-Rate.Bottle, Hop Leaf (Chicago); sampled in a Hop Leaf tulip.  This is my second re-rate, but Im including it because it was a more recent bottle than the 1998, and my impression was that it was better than my first rating.  Head was ridiculously thick and foamy, and would revive with a couple of swirls of the glass.  The flavor overall was not as sickly sweet as I remember, and the spice was so much more evident.  Very nice dry finish, with a bit of hoppiness in it too.  Still not near as good as the 1998 bottle, but much better than I remember.  Ive adjusted the appearance up one and the flavor down one to reflect my new impressions.

Re-Rate. Bottle (1998 vintage), Heeren van Liedekerke, Denderleeuw.  I was informed by my waiter that in 1998, De Dolle was using Rodenbach yeast for the Stille Nacht.  Whenever I start homebrewing, I need to get my hands on some of that yeast, because every beer it touches turns to dopeness.  As you can see below, I didnt enjoy a more recent rendition of this beer.  The score above is a slightly lowered version of this vintage rating.  Clear golden brown with yellow-tan head leaving a thick dusting and an arch of lace where the head used to touch the side.  A few sparse collumns of tiny bubbles visible up the side of the glass.  Aroma is stiff: buttered raisins in a banana cream sauce made with Madiera.  Deep cherry flavor predominates on the sweet body (must be the Rodenbach yeast).  Malts taste like sweet butter with pure cane sugar blended into it; theyre strongest in the very beginning of the finish.  Golden raisins and over-ripe cherry flank the strong cherry middle, the raisins trying to take over the taste a couple times.  Finish is kind of disappointing after such a flavorful body, its mostly an echo with alcohol dryness on the top of the tongue.  Some sweet apple shows up late.  Hops are very subtle, adding a bit of orange citrus in the finish and dryness.  Dope.  10/4/10/4/18 = 4.6

Re-Rate.  I had this bottle at the Hop Duvel Cafe, Gent.  I thought it was the Stille Nacht Reserva 2005, which is what the guy told me, but he was wrong.  I bought some bottles to bring home, and was told that it was some other special version of Stille Nacht from 2005, but not the Reserva.  Since there is no seperate entry here on RateBeer, Im putting it here for the time being.  Murky orange with brown-red glow in the middle of the glass; thick dusting of head with an island on the side of sudsier bubbles.  Tight lace creeps up the side from the surface, pretty sticky.  Bubble rivulets up the side of the glass.  Smells bready, malty, with lemon grass and a tinge of corriander.  Full and warm in the mouth, the alcohol starts warm and almost burns toward the finish.  Flavors are orange peel, over-ripe plum and apricot; it reminds me of a Thomas Hardy style barley wine in the middle, but instead of golden raisin being dominant, the flavor is lighter (like dried apricots and banana chips).  Mouthfeel is not light: syrup of pure cane sugar.  Seems like it needs a few years in the bottle to smooth out and mellow.  Three seconds into the finish is where this shines, when the flavors reach peak intensity and roundness; the fruits taste fresh and lively, with sourdough maltiness over the top of it.  The end of the finish is dominated by alcohol in the throat; it also evidences black pepper and corriander spiciness.  Very interesting contrast between the middle and end, Im very intrigued to see what this is like three years from now when it has pulled together.  Not dope yet, but has potential.  7/4/8/5/16=4.0.

Original rating. Bottle into tulip glass, Hop Leaf (Chicago) 7/2/04.  I was excited about this one as Id had the Reserva with Quiroga a few weeks back, and it was dope.  This, however, was sub-dope.  It poured with absolutely no head (I even tried holding the bottle about a foot and a half above the glass as I poured.  Nothing.)  Golden yellow, yeast very visible in little tiny shards, suspended in the glass and not circulating or settling on the bottom.  That was the first clue.  This stuff is beer syrup.  It was so sweet and viscous I could barely finish the glass (I thought it would be rude to take it to the Hopleaf bathroom to drain pour).  Still, before the grossness overpowered me, I caught some nice fruity flavors: grape, a touch of annis, and a very subtle hop bitterness (didnt even come through on every sip).  Maybe next time I have pancakes or waffles, Ill try another bottle.  Im guessing this one has to be aged, so that yeast can ferment some of the sugar out of it.  6/2/6/1/8 = 2.3","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"
2317,"2004-06-30",4.8,"1999 bottle drank in 2004 at Kulminator in Antwerp. Poured a hazy medium brown beer with a super huge head with perfect retention. Carbonation is perfect with bubbles still present 10 minutes after the beer was poured, which is a bit surprising considering the age of this beer. Aroma is a quite strong mix of plums, sugars and roasted malts. The taste of this beer is one of the most wonderful things I had the chance to drink in my lifetime and consisted of a mix of roasted and sweet malt, plums and a sweet bitter finish.

2317,"2004-05-20",3.6,"It pours a murky amber with almost no head. It looks still. This makes the bridge between an english barley wine and a belgian christmas ale. Aroma is rather complex, very yeasty and sweet, but also full of fruity esters. The honeyish malt profile is extremely fruity (peaches, apples, vinous grapes, oranges, pears). Aroma is also quite spicy (mint, cloves) and alcoholic, a little less would have been appreciated actually as at times you feel almost like you're having a scotch. A faint bitterness fails from balancing the almost cloying ravaging sweetness. Palate is yeasty, extremely sweet and with more of those fruits dancing on the tongue, well supported by a medium body with low to medium carbonation. No doubt this is complex and full-flavoured, but the balance is just lacking when its so sweet and a bit too much alcoholic for its own good. I must say I feel a bit let down, not only cause I love De Dolle, but also because there are plenty of things going on in this beer, but they dont seem so well blended while it has a fairly good reputation.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Fruits, apples, grapes, oranges, alcohol, candy sugar and sweetness in the nose, complex aroma i think.
Goddam... This is fucking sweet, not too cloying but it has extreme sweetness. The flavor is all about candy and fruits. Later on it turns out abit acidy and dry.
Its just so full with a nice touch of alcohol. This is a wolf in sheeps dresses, you think its a easy and nice beer, but it attacks your palate with extreme sweetness and leaves you all confused.

Undertones later of some mild bitterness and woody character. The finish displays a spicy note with a touch of acidity. The mouthfeel is full, lush, and sticky. Alcohol very well marked. A nice beer but lacks the full balance of the Reserva. Thanks Matta for the bottle.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

The aroma inspires dreams of monks surrounding brewpots and chanting.  The scent of alcohol is overpowering at first, but gives way to hints of fruit and oak.  The flavor envelops the tongue in this sweetness that is both joyous and solemn at the same time.  It fades slowly, revealing the tang of alcohol, the strength of wood, and the bitter of hops, each in their own time, all underpinned with a luxurious butteriness.

Complex aroma of alcohol, sweet fruit, vanilla and malt. Medium-bodied and borderline cloying at times, but with a satisfying array of flavors. The different fruits like plum and apple are at the forefront. There is also a nice malt, spice and alcohol presence. The finish is very sweet with a lot of yeast.

2317,"2004-02-29",3.5,"I think I finally settled on my personal dictionary reference for cloying. I wanted so to like it. Actually I did. Found pear covered in a syrupy sauce along with other luscious and delicious flavors, but I just couldn't continue w/o thinking I almost couldn't handle another sip. Desert that should be dealt in small doses. I longed for a really astringent geueze or very bitterly hopped beer. After making my way past the half-to-three-quarter mark I succumbed to the temptation to try a Big Nacht. Took a bit of Still Nacht and poured it in a new glass and added an equal amount of Bigfoot. Nice. I admit it. I have no way of knowing, only having had this so long ago what is ""normal"". All I know is that there was not the acidity or extra hop bitterness in this to keep me from enjoying this combination more than the original for an endured period.

You can kinda see the yeasties a bit floating around in there. No head was produced during or after the pour but a very thin ring sits along the edge the whole glass through. No real lacing either, some thickly drippings leaving miniscule specks. Aroma is warming and sweet with nice dark fruity esters and floral tones. Some notes touching on plum, darkly savoring juicy oranges, raisins, sweet toffee, dark fresh honey, and caramel swirl about with some soft spice and phenol hints. Taste is immaculately displayed with great, easy, and very yummy flavors of sweetish dark fruits and heavy liquored candies. Yum! Oh my, this is nice. Exceptional thickness. Its got a great heavy creamyness and feel thats loaded with great dark caramel and toffee candy laced with intermingling sweetened and ripe dark fruits of yellow raisins, plum, dates, and dulled orange. Notes of honey dart across the finish along with slight floral herbalness and a lingering darkened sweetness resides as the thickness just keeps sticking within and coating every pore in the back of the throat. A late warmth sneaks up into the nose clearing the senses a bit. Incredible for 8%, usually that amount doesn't offer up so much warming attributes but this stands on its own.

Enormously complex nose by turns sweet apple, apricot, vanilla and whiskey.  On the tongue, extremely sweet (honey, apples, cherries) and quite alcoholic.  Very thick, syrupy mouthfeel, pepper on the finish, slightly drier towards the end.  Just a little too thick and cloyingly sweet to be truly great; just doesnt have enough acid or hops to balance.

December 2005, on tap at The Maproom in Chicago.  Wow, my first De Dolle on tap!  This one has so much depth and so many layers of every kind of sweet imaginable....orangepeel, molasses, vanilla, honey....but it has just a touch more sharpness and is definitely more drinkable.  On tap an overal 4.2 vs a 4.0 bottled; rating is an average of the two.  Im just blown away that I liked the tap version more than I already liked it bottled; cant wait to try more from the spigot from this greatest of all breweries.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

Feb 2004 So Im an idiot... Knocked this one out of the fridge while reaching for another beer, and just barely saved it with my foot. My sigh of relief lasted about two seconds before realising that the bottle was fizzing. I grabbed a glass and popped it open hoping to save it which simply allowed about half the bottle to explode into my sink. Sigh... I rescued enough to have a bit but it was a tragic loss. Thanks to IPfreely for picking up this 2001 vintage bottle for me from Premier Gourmet. Good size white head on a hazy amber body. Aroma is big sugary malt, and foretells of the massively sweet but not quite cloying flavour has a bit of alcohol and a slightly bitter finish to balance it off. A fine beer that I am going to have to try again in honour of the fallen portion. Perhaps a younger vintage to pay tribute to the lost.   7/4/8/4/16 - 3.9","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

Lingers in your mouth for a while. Lick your lips and you'll think you've just tasted schnozberrys. Interesting. If they would have upped the bitterness to match the sweetness this would be good from fresh to aged.

The flavour is sweet, yeasty, fruity and has some alcahol notes. The alcahol is well hidden though. Has a dry sugary finish and ends up with a alcahol burnt. Very sweet beer, but not unpleasantly sweet.Had the 1996 vintage at Kulminator Oh boy was that great (9-4-10-5-19). Dark reddish brown. Huge light brown head. Aroma of yeast, dense ripe fruits, light alcohol, loads of spices and some sugary sweetness. Flavour is even better. So balanced, smooth and full. I could sip this all day long. Again the smooth ripe fruits, sugars, alcohol, spice and some liqourice. Full bodied. Ends on a warming spiced fruityness. World class.

Flavor is very sweet, almost cloying, with candi sugar, wood, musty earth, grapes and alcohol swimming in the murky body.  Sticky mouthfeel in the sense of watered-down corn syrup.  Minimal carbonation enhances the syrupy, fruit juicy palate.  Dense and tasty, this would serve as a nice dessert sipper.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
2317,"2003-12-08",3.6,"(2003?) Hazy orange color with no head retention, very little apparent carbonation, but does have alcohol legs that cling to the side of my snifter.  Grape and sweet malt aroma @ first sniff; musty, earthy, and woody notes follow;  also peppery spice, yeasty, and a buttery diacetyl as well as alcohol as it warms.  sweet malty w/ woody, maple flavor, vinous raisin, and yeasty breadiness.  Sweetness is almost sticky and cloying to me, but does have a hop flavor in the finish and aftertaste to balance.  The diacetyl int the aroma does not translate into the flavor, but there is added fruitiness from the alcohol in the flavor as it warms.  Very low carbonation w/a warming alcohol, but lightly astringent and very full bodied.  As with the Oerbier Reserva, I like the complexities, but not really wild about the characteristics of this beer just yet.  To me, it's borderline cloying even for a self proclaimed malty beer lover such is myself. I've got another bottle or two to see how it ages.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

The flavor is like apricot jam, candy, very small hop spike, and some alcohol notes.  The palate is about as close to syrup as any beer I've had.  Actually, this really needs some serious bittering in order to be as balanced as it is; as it warms and you get used to the flavor, you begin to really taste the hops that went into this.  Overall, this is a perfect winter seasonal.  Wow, this is a rare treat.  Thanks to Blue Max Liquors!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"

2317,"2003-12-04",4.2,"11.6 oz. slender brown bottle. This beer is 12 % ABV, not 8 %. Poured out a hazy apricot color, with not much head, probably due to the extremely high ABV. Cloudy from the yeast sediment swirled up by myself. I wanted all the flavors this beer has to offer.
Aromas are of medicinal phenols, candi sugar, Belgian yeast, and caramel malts. Smells like a caramel apple. Fruity, aromatic, and it changes as the beer warms up. Slight aromas of Nugget hops way off in the background. Tastes of caramel malts, slight biscuity taste as well. Hops make a sharp but brief appearance in the middle of the taste, but the malts & alcohol simply overpower it. Stinging, peppery alcohol bite to it as well. Finishes dry, and sweet, but not cloying at all. Lingers on the tongue for quite awhile.
This is a beer you can only drink one of, and a small one at that.","","Cobra"

Fruity aroma with notes of apple and a hint of alcohol.  It is amazingly clear for a Stille Nacht, most are quite murky.  Pretty light bodied, with a crisp apple cider bite in the finish.  There is a hint of astringency and alcohol in the finish as well.  Rich notes of caramel and a slight bit of acidity.  Over all a very fruity beer.I liked it a bit more when they were getting the Rodenbach yeast; the acidity brings a whole other dimentsion, that this beer is currently missing.  I have heard rumors that they will bring back the old yeast culture back.  I certainly hope so, cause I love the acidity.  Still a world class beer and one of my favorites.  This was one of those beers that I had towards the beginning of my beer journey.  It has held up well and I will always want more of this than I can get.
Various Samples prior to 2002A deep golden color, with amber notes to it.  Pours with hardly any head at all.  It looks quite thick as it is poured into the glass, and is very lightly carbonated.

The beer pours out with massive head, completely white in colour, and the beer shows a nice golden colour with orange highlights. The aroma is very nice, definately sweet because of the ripe fruit, apples and grapes come to mind as well as some yeastyness. Very thick mouthful and very sweet initially. This fades a bit with time, but the sweetness still overwhelms the malt. The hops show through a bit in the end, but the malt is simply left behind. Regardless of how sweet it is, the complexities arise well after the beer has been sipped. The palate starts drying out and the flavours linger in the mouth.

Body starts rich, viscous and sweet with some slight toasty biscuity notes, fruity complexity and some warmth toward the finish with lingering bready peppery yeast.  An age-worthy Belgian classic.

Rerate of a 1998 vintage on 12/11/04 courtesy of skaughty: Pours a murky caramel color with a thin whispy white head.  Aroma of dry, slightly oxidized grapes, cherries and strawberries.

Nothing like Orval, Stille Nacht had a very malty peppery aroma.  The flavor was very sweet, not malty, but sweet and had a strong flavor of currants.

Nose is pretty subdued, with some apple peel, yeast and acidic qualities.  Flavors are incredible.  Gala or Fuji apples dipped in caramel with a slight toffee character up front and towards the middle.  Finishing with a sweet and spicy quality (cinnamon and ginger?) and hot alcohol.

Rerate 4/9/11. Attractive orange beer with a tightly beaded foam.  Yeast, apricot, and orange in the nose.

Sometimes though, carbonation disappears, aroma is of unfinished pie, with flour, sweet fruit jelly and all...Flavors are very sweet (maple syrup, mead, canned fruit) but do not blend well with the alcohol bite in the end...Apparently, effervescence is necessary to marry its constituents...Rating above is an average of both experiences...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, cookie), lightly hoppy (flowers), lightly to moderately yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of honey, Juicy Fruit gum, dried mango, banana, dried pineapple, alcohol, pepper, mint.
Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.
Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic.
Been a long long time since Ive seen a fresh bottle of this, but wow, Kris still has his game on for some of his line up (whereas some like Oerbier and the Export Stout are always infected or dull). This and the Dulle Teve and Arabier are all still quite nice, and this is the best of the three. Candyish but ridiculously complex and attractive...tons of tropical fruits, just insane. Surprisingly balanced in the mouth...Im used to this being too syrupy sweet in years past, but the finish on this batch is surprisingly crisp and bitter. Quite boozy but tolerable thanks to the rich body.

2317,"2002-08-18",4.1,"Merry Christmas. Fall is in the August air today, so, why not? As always De Dolle creates a beer worthy of examination. Beautiful, almost iridescent orange color w. a small (by De Dolle standards), creamy head. Delicately carbonated w. a few streams of fine bubbles rising lesiurely to the top of the glass. Packed w. malt aromas. Also, oak, or other seasoning wood, and cherries. The beer is simultaneously a near syrupy-sweet liqueur  and a crisply tart red ale. Extremely full mouthfeel with spicy cherry-chocolate flavors dominating. Finishes sweet, but clean and woody. I dont think there are any hops in this, with sourness replacing bitterness as a finisher. Nice beer.","Illinois, USA","DavefromChicago"
2317,"2002-07-21",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 15, 2012     Cloudy golden body, large frothy head, great retention. Spicy citrus/apple aroma. Spicy and sweet  malt body, notes of cinnamon apples, honey, candy sugar. Soft mouthfeel, some citrus notes and hints of nutmeg. Very smooth finish for the abv, some sourness, maybe a bit sugary but overall a great brew.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
2317,"2002-07-14",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2004 Very tasty Belgian. Sweet marmalade, apricot nose, lots of yeast in the aroma aswell. Unmistakable yeasty Belgian nose. Sweet palate, almost like a dessert wine, bit of a citric acidity in there aswell towards the end, lots of flavour, and unique. Liked it the second time i had it a little better than the first. Soft yet assertive at the same time, lovely.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
2317,"2002-07-03",4.7,"Slightly hazy orange brown with sub-mm yeast flecks. Large mid-tan lasting head with some light ring like lacing on glass. Awsome rum eggnog tasting foam - best tasting head on any beer Ive rated. Other aromas include, spices, muscat raisins,  plums and something that reminds me of the tangy substance used in instant chicken noodle soup! Medium bodied with a smooth sweet palate but not too cloying and balanced with enough bitter to make it interesting. The alcohol comes through imediately and quickly warms the edges of the ears but, hey, this is a festive beer so what do you expect. Other flavours also along the line of festive spirits including, rum and raisin, vintage port wine, burnt sugar and dried apples. The body is medium and the finish is mainly alcohol and sweet lingering alcohol. I love this stuff. Its not for every day drinking but as a festive drink I think its outstanding! My uncle Bob would definitely quaff himself under the table at Christmas (or anytime really) on this one if I let him.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","OlJuntan64"
2317,"2002-06-03",4.2,"Huge foamy, frothy head that lingers, is the first thing you notice, then...............Apples!  Thats what you think when you taste this beer.  Its a very sweet, appley-beer thats quite strong but hides its punches well.  This is, without a doubt, my favorite De Dolle beer.  Though I really dont care for their products, generally, I truly respect De Dolles creativity.  Each beer is very different from the others.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"

2317,"2002-04-25",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2012 Very sweet taste, bit tart. Raisins and porto. Very full bodied, almost buttery and oily. Storing the beer for a few years brings out more tartness, makes the beer more complex, lessens the sweetness and further improves carbonation.Re-rate: vintage 2003. Orange color, thin but steady head, cloudy. Buttery, somewhat yeasty aroma. Thick. Buttery flavor with pear and mango. Some roasted malt, alcoholic. Gets tastier and more buttery as the beer warmens up. Probably needs more time to develop. Still a good quality beer, but lightyears away from the Stille Nacht 10 years ago, that would easily score above 4.0.
2004 version, tasted dec 04: Firm and lasting head. Vinous, somewhat dusty aroma. Immensely powerful. Some hops, alcohol. Full bodied, edgy and sharp. Hints op pepper, endives, dust and roast. Needs storing.
2005 version, tasted december 05. Mandarin Napoleon aroma, citric with a hint of butter. A bit sharp and alcoholic on the tongue and surprise, the very first signs of an upcoming sourness. Hints of butter and band aids. I am very curious how this beer will develop. Will definitely store a few bottles.
2006 version, tasted januari 2007: orange golden color. Malty aroma with figs and peach. Sweet, buttery flavor with vanilla. Rather alcoholic. Peach. Powerful and likeable (7 3 7 4 14 = 3.5)
2007 version, tasted december 2007. Orange blonde, hazy with floaties. Raspberry, honey, butter and yeast in the aroma. Full bodied, alcoholic, yeasty and buttery flavor. Mango. Some bitterness in the aftertaste. The first sings already of an upcoming vinous sourness. Young but promising. Dolle Brouwers is again making further progress. Will definitely buy more for cellaring.

The 2010 version, tasted in may 2011 is disappointing. Butter and vinegar in the aroma. Already sour flavor with vinegar and butter notes. A new yeast??

The 2012 version, tasted in december 2012: Pale amber color. Tiny chunks of yeast. Confit fruit and butter in the aroma. Malty swet flavor with buttery notes, ripe mango, pineapple. Upcoming tartness. Promising.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
2317,"2002-04-19",3.6,"With all the comments about tartness, I was expecting a flanders red ale. But this is not that style...it is tart-sweet, malty and yeasty, and very very good. Beautiful color and rolling large bubbles leading to a perfect head for the first half of the brew before diminishing. Mine says Bottled 1996 on it. Is this normal? De Dolle Brouwers rock!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
2317,"2002-04-18",3.9,"We actually ordered an Ara Bier and the server brought this by mistake (she caught the mistake, brought the Ara Bier and we had this one on the house - woohoo). I clearly remember the first time I had this beer from the NE Taproom many many years ago - I hated it. I have no notes on it, but I just clearly remember I didnt like it. I was kind of excited to try it now, probably 10 years later, to see if my tastes had matured or whether I would still hate it (like Hair of the Dog Adam Beer). First impression is the aroma - it smells sweet and raisiny. We also had a Thomas Hardy (1996) on the table and the aromas were very similar (well, 2 out of 3 of us felt that way) - Still Nacht was perhaps a bit sweeter in the nose, with hints of pepper. I must admit that I loved this beer this time around. It has a sweet rolling flavor that blossoms into a very puckery sour finish. Serious sour finish. Very serious. If you like funky beers such as geuze, imagine a cross between a sour geuze, a barleywine and a strong belgian such as NIce. Delicious!","Oreland, Pennsylvania, USA","chronictonic"
2317,"2002-04-01",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2006 Funny! I just read my old ratings of this. I tried it twice and had trouble with the sourness, but noted that I should try it again, giving it a 3.5. Well, many sour beers later, I find this not all that sour!  First a doughy yeasty aroma, very classic of De Dolle, very phenolic. Some mild acidity up front, but quickly melding with a very sugary sweet malt body, with dates and raisins following that. Finish is alcoholic and hot, with peppery stings on the soft palate and throat. There seems to be a touch of spicy hop occupying a narrow range between the sweet/sour front and the hot finish - its a very fleeting sensation, but it does add to the complexity of this fine fine Belgian ale.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

2317,"2001-11-08",3.7,"Quite good, however it burns all the way down, I liken it to taking a shot of citrus flavored rum (ie: Bacardi O) not necessarily in flavor, but in feeling. Still very flavorful, plenty of dried fruit, plums, rasins, etc. Eat before or while drinking, not on an empty stomach.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"

2317,"2001-10-02",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 16, 2004 re-rate, bottled 2003: Fruity sweet apple aroma. Golden color, white head, good lace, debris floating around. Way too sweet, light bitter, hint of sourness, malty, apple, hint of pear, sugar. Very full and warming. Rating in 1999, 4.5: This one knocked me over. Its sweet and heavy. Very rich taste and full.","Delft, NETHERLANDS","jbrus"
2317,"2001-08-22",4.1,"Interesting. I will say my favorite of the De Dolle family is still the Bos Keun Paasbier. Stille Nacht is a good beer nonetheless. A dark, golden pour with little head unlike the Bos Keun. Aroma of an old belgian brown mixed with a kerosene base that disappears over a few minutes. Appley taste is rather enjoyable at the end and for an aftertaste. A little too sweet for my taste. But then again it is only the end of august as I review this.............I will try the others around Christmas. Its only fair since it is a seasonal!","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","trappist12"

Still very good, but a bit to cloying in the candied fruit department.  I even had a six year-old aged bottle, and it wasnt all that great either.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"

2317,"2001-01-14",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2003 1996 vintage, bottled.  Cinnamon and brown sugared apples, pomegranate, red grapefruit, faint candyish sweetness, fusel, band-aid phenols, hop spice and citric tartness all reach out to give your nasal passages an invigorating tingle they won't soon forget.  Unique, opaque rusty red-orange color with a very creamy and lasting head and thick sheets of intricate lace.  Flavor is balanced with sweet, malty, fruity and hoppy aspects combining, then overtaken, drenched by a wave of acidic, citrusy tartness and many spices.  Finishes with a dizzying blur of flavors, a lemon here, a bit of sugar there.  So many levels are touched on here.  This is having the same effect on me that drinking a large glass of orange juice often does, awakening with a tingling electricity.  Staggering complexity in this almost overwhelming, supremely crafted vintage.  I really could go on about this stuff.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
