SABOR: nuevamente explotan las notas a frutos tropicales dulces; moras azules, mango y piña madura, maracuyá, melón, papaya, naranja dulce, mandarina, algo de jugo de uva blanca, ligeramente algo herbal como pasto recién cortado y muy ligeramente pino, dulzor de las maltas con algunas notas a miel muy discretas, apenas para realzar los lúpulos. El retrogusto queda un amargor medio bajo, con larga permanencia de los sabores frutales que siguen, siguen, siguen y siguen pegados al paladar.

1188,"2016-07-31",4.0,"750 mL bottle shared by ebone1988. The pour is a turbid golden orange with a thinner white head and a little bit of lace left behind. The aroma is pretty good. Lots of hops. There is a good balance of citra and mosaic. Its good. There is a great hop and a nice smooth juiciness. The flavor is bring and juicy. There is a hop balance thats a little strange but well balanced. I love how there is no malt in the Trillium beers. The mouth feel is a little heavier than Id like with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly sweet hoppiness. Its really interestingly complex.

1188,"2016-06-19",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Grapefruit pith and various citrus fruit are emboldened by dank hop undercurrents, leading to coniferous bitterness and much enjoyment for the hophead.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the misty blond.
-Lightly honeyed cereals build a smooth structure for all the hops to play on.
-The flavor profile and finish arent excessive; just immensely flavorful while leaving room for drinkability.
-This is a great Double IPA every way you look at it.

1188,"2015-04-18",4.1,"Live from NH! Bottle (750 ml). Bottled 24-03-2015. From Jon, thanks! Split 3-ways with Chris and Julien.

Appearance: Slightly hazy golden-orange with a medium white head and good lacing. 

Aroma: Aroma is super deep and give an esential oils impression that I have found in many Trillium hoppy beers so far. Burst of tropical fruits (mangoes, pineapples, passionfruit) along doughy malts, perfumy hops and light dank presence.

Taste: Moderately sweet. Nice tropical fruits features with a good malt backbone, resins, light white wine flavors, a bit of alcohol and moderate bitterness.

Palate: Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Oily. Dry and a bit warming finish. Tropical fruits aftertaste. 

Overall: Superbly balanced DIPA. The alcohol is well integrated and the drinkability level is very high for a 9% abv beer. Another really nice beer from Trillium.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
1188,"2015-04-17",4.3,"Bottle at Ryans April 2015 tasting with Paul, Vinny, Al and Ryan. Pours a bright hazy golden body with soft white lacing. Aroma is bright lemonade, funky Galaxy hop, dank fruit, melon and pineapple. Incredible nose. Mouthfeel is more of the tropical fruits coming through with a nice mineral character, lemonade and bright lemon funky hop.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
1188,"2015-04-14",4.3,"750mL bottle, pours a hazy golden blonde with a small white head. Nose is super dank, with truckloads of tangy dank hops - not a whole lot else. Dank and hoppy as hell. Flavour matches accordingly, with shitloads of dank tangy hops primarily from the citra, with light tropical fruits and just enough dry biscuity malt to back. Phenomenally balanced - dry and hoppy and dank as hell. Master work.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

1188,"2015-04-08",4.4,"Draught at Publick House, for Trillium 2nd Anniv., 3/23/15Massively fluffy white head is well-retained and tops a moderately hazy, very sunny golden body.From the first sniff, you know. Its going to be a good one. Incredibly clean, bright, hop notes portray all sorts of tropical fruits. Suffice to say weve all smelled a delightful tropical fruit-hopped DIPA and this is one of the best ones. No yeast, vitamin, dough, dishwater, blanding; none of that. Soft, but perceptible honeyed malts sit in the background giving support but certainly adding nothing more than needed. Alcohol nowhere to be found. Aroma strength is very high.The flavor delivers and then some. Kind of surprised by the ratings, seems like almost everyone loves a solid DIPA. Not that the ratings are low here; far from it, but I couldnt find much to fault this thing for. Wonderfully effervescent carbonation spreads the delicious hop flavors about, while just a touch of alcohol (welcome here) and bitterness begin to build. The fluffy, moderately sweet pilsner malts balance nearly perfectly here and the whole thing glides down the throat leaving you wondering how you just drank a 9% abv Double IPA. It sucks to nitpick, but I guess thats what rating beers is about and I guess, ultimately, this ones just a little on the sweet/sugary side. Hard to fault it much for that, as Id MUCH rather brewers err on the side of a bit too much balancing malt instead of the reverse leaving a mouthful of astringent, dry, burning resin.Other than that, what else is not to love here? Not quite as explosively juicy and overwhelmingly lush as Pliny the Younger, but it makes you think along those lines, which is always impressive. If Trillium is doing this on their 2nd Anniversary, theyve got a very bright future ahead.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
