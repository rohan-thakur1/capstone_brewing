The pour is a deep red color with a thick-ish pink head that falls down to a thin ring quickly, leaving a couple spots of lace. The aroma is dominated by juicy and fleshy cherry. There is a light raspberry kind of sweetness, almost like a jam happening. There is a light woody pit in there as well, but its amazing. The flavor is just as excellent. The cherry absolutely dominates with a touch of funk and a light pit addition. This is just so tart and lovely. The smoothness really blows me away. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly sweet and tart cherry that lasts forever. I love it!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

4415,"2016-05-29",4.4,"Bottle. Thanks, KL. Two ratings here, for two vintages compared side by side.
1) 2001 Vintage. Toasted or scorched bread aroma, some smoke, char, wood, mold, and leather. Thin hazy reddish-brown color, thin pink head. Flavors of tart sour cherries, sour celery, mild acidity, and some vinegar. Thin body, with mild astringency. Very unusual nose (we discussed the provenance of this feature and sort of left it unresolved). Flavors are sourish, acidic, and rather diminished from the 2008 vintage, but still interesting and solid. This one has held up. Rating: 10/3/8/4/16 = 4.1

2) 2008 Vintage. Generous funky manure, very rich cherry nose. Bright red color with a 2-3cm. pink head and good lacing. Moderately tart cherries in initial. Flavors get brighter and deeper in mid palate. Some nuttiness emerges (almonds?) along with spice in late mid and finish. Thin, with light astringency. Wow!

Pours a vibrant ember to lilac color with a fizzy, bubbly head, leaving back a thick film of lacing at the rim of the glass.

Dusty, leather accompanied, funky cherry from the very first smell. Produces a ripe, dark sour cherry impression, while ensuring an intriguing complexity, due to wood bark, dried oak and heated cherry pit among a fermented tartness.

Drinks soft and perfectly balanced, while adding a subtle dryness to the uprising, associated tartness during the finish, exhibiting the beers flavor richness perfectly well.

Amarena sweet cherries among a pleasant, earth coated funkiness, showcasing the fruits ripeness with a sugary peak to them. The beer produces a prominent stone quality among a dusty, pleasantly pungent funkiness. Utmost fruity in the finish, featuring almost overripe, juicy cherries in all its facetts and layers.

A different beast than their regular Kriek, way more complex and fruitier. The sherries establish a fantastic characteristic between lusciously ripe, and already fermented fruits, tied together by a crisp, citraic sour punch.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Aromas of cherry skin and cherry pie filling waft out along with some notes of barnyard funk, wet basement and oak. Very inviting. Taste follows the nose, but I could not have been prepared for the massive cherry skin/cherry pie notes that accompanied this beer. Just loaded with fruit! The mouthfeel is a bit thicker than the regular Cantillon Kriek. And the signature funk has taken hold. Really nice tart note in there too. Not a puckering sour, but more of a tang. The oak gives some vanilla to couple with the cherry sweetness and leads into a semi-dry finish. Nice cherry tartness lingers for days.

4415,"2015-12-18",3.9,"Je me trompe où la série Lou pepe de Cantillon est plus acétique que certaines de leurs autres bières? Le côté vinaigré est en effet assez présent... peut-être un peu trop.

Cest encore plus appétissant lorsque le liquide se réchauffe légèrement! En bouche cest très sûre et il manque, malheureusement, un peu de ce côté plus complexe qui ressort davantage, à mon avis, dans les lambiques non fruités.

Im Abgang noch mehr Zitronensaft, dazu holzige Herbe, aus der die Kirschkerne herausschmecken. - Typisches Lambic, aber als Kriek fast enttäuschend: von den berühmten Schaarbeeker Kirschen ist herzlich wenig zu schmecken, das erinnert eher an Zitronensaft. Dennoch eine interessante Erfahrung. - Bewertung: 3,3
 Der Rest aus der Flasche am nächsten Tag schmeckte schon viel überzeugender, immer noch sauer aber mit einer unvergleichlich kirschig-säuerlichen Herbe. Doch ein großartiges Bier. Es braucht nur etwas Gewöhnung.","Beijing, CHINA","Moravius"

O: This was my first time trying this. It apparently caused a ruckus at my local bottle shop which I wont name to avoid them being swamped again. Needless to say, its hard to find anything from Cantillon in the western U.S. Onto my humble thoughts. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It was not icky sweet like what must be artificially sweetened lambics. This was incredibly balanced. The sweetness was there, but the complexity was the shining part. The smoothness was first, then woodiness, overripe cherries, brown sugar, green stem, tart cherries, and funk on the back. I wouldnt move mountains to have this again, but it was a nice experience.","","WABeerFiend"

4415,"2014-12-22",3.2,"May 12th, 2013 - Joining our celebrity line up of beers for an eminent tasting event is a thoroughly aged, well bred Lou Pepe from the year 2001. While the world was leaving behind the 90s, Cantillon was hard at work putting this together. I knew that some age would tone down the sourness, but I think maybe the Lou Pepe went just a little too far, taking 12 years to get here, and losing some of its fang and claw. The first clue comes in the nose, where it smells a bit like chlorine, or a pool freshly treated. Theres a touch of sulfur too, and maybe even baby powder. Its clean and sanitary smelling, but unexpected from a beer. The palate is still alive and well. Carbonation gives the Lou Pepe some life, activating the thin layer of flavor that seems to be left after much of it has faded away over time. What remains is a clear, pure taste of light watermelon, apple skins, and an acidic splash. The overall impression is a highly sophisticated carbonated beverage, which suggests that this is either an ephemeral beer, or the ravages of time took too much and gave back too little. Still, it is a landmark moment, and I am happy to have given this legendary brew a try.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Fresh fruity taste of the sour cherries beautifully mixed with the lambic esters, tomato, powerful lambic sourness, sharp, appetizing, earthy, woody, sparkling champenoise mouthfeel, with a very complex, long, oaky, dry finish. One of Cantillons great masterpieces, like the other two Lou Pépés.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Pours a bright reddish pink with a big head and nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is tart cherries with a nice bright acidity. Its got some lemon rind, barnyard, & musty basement... but its dominated by tart cherry character.

The flavor is loads of sour cherry, with some oak & some tart lemony character as well. Its very fruit forward but holds that bone dryness giving that great juxtaposition that the best fruit lambics pull off so well. Its got the earthiness of citrus rind & some oakiness, but like the flavor is just extraordinarily cherry dominated. 

The mouthfeel is nicely bubbly and lively on the tongue.

A: Pours a deep plum with a light pink head. Sits pretty in the glass - if you were to show this to someone they might call it a chick beer. Poor ignorant bastards.

N: Lots of ripe sour cherries, oak, some vinegar and glue. Wine grape and raspberry jame in here. Some straw and lemon zest. 

T: Cherry dominant. Rounded sourness with a touch of fruity sweetness. Has a wonderful depth of oak and fruits. 

M: Sharply carbonated with a light, manageable body. I love how the Belgians are able to get such character into such a drinkable beer. 

O: Tasty and it seems like its balanced out the fruit and the funk at this point. Delicious. Need more.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
4415,"2013-05-20",4.2,"750ml bottle, 2009 Vintage, from La Cerveteca in Barcelona. Pours a cloudy, ruby-brown colored body with a finger-width, fizzy, pinkish head that dissipates quickly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma has a nice balance of tart and slightly sweet cherries with some dry funk, wet oak, must, and lactic acid. Flavor is similar. Tart cherries up front with some lemony notes and a good amount of wet oak before some sweeter cherries come in alongside a nice musty funk. Lactic acid comes out more towards the end before this finishes pretty tart and dry, but really well balanced with a touch of sweetness and a nice, light funk. Fairly lengthy aftertaste following a light body and a somewhat active, soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty awesome Kriek. Very dry and tart, but there is a slight sweetness from the cherries that provides a really nice complexity. The light funk, wet wood, and lactic acid stay balanced as well. Damn good beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

A - Exceptionally ruby red cherry appearance. Hazy and consistently dark with a half finger head produced on the pour but faded quickly. 

S - Very mild kriek scent on the nose. Slight hint of walnuts. Jammy and funky.

T - Wow. Excellent cherry jam taste. Up front tart and sour taste with an acetic finish of big gorgeous cherries. The taste is very fresh. It tastes like these cherries were picked yesterday. Very barnyardish and up front funkiness. 

M - Swishing this around I get almost no carbonation. Light body. Perfect Cherry pulp finish

O - I have an 05 Kriek in the cellar. This beer only makes me want to try the 05 more. This is great but needs to age for a while. Fresh, its not very good. I want this with a few years on it. Thats the key. 

Update: 2008 Bottle shared with friends:

Smell was more Jammy and up front cherry than the last bottle. Taste was more tart with a subdued cherry compared to the 2009. Carbonation was in line with the 2009 and same finish.

This one is interesting, tons of cherry in the aroma but tons of tartness/sourness in the flavor.

4415,"2012-07-11",4.3,"2009 vintage. What a spectacular beer. Pours ruby red with an initial big foamy head that dissipates to a light ring. No lacing. Aromas of barnyard, maybe some blue cheese, sour cherries, and maybe some cotton candy. Possibly cereal as well. Taste is sour, but very well balanced with the fruit. Neither is overwhelming.

This lambic pours a stunningly gorgeous, brilliant ruby color with a beautiful off white head reminiscent of sea foam. No lacing left in the wake, as to be expected, given the style.

The aroma is fantastic. Cherry pie jumps out at you if you get your nose anywhere in the vicinity of the bottle. Classic Cantillon barnyard funk along with hay, straw, wild yeast give the beer a very inviting scent.

The taste is even better than I remember from the previous occasion I drank this beer in 2007. All aspects of the flavor are spot on. The sourness in relation to fresh fruit ratio couldnt be better. This beer has incredible depth and complexity, and is just phenomenal. It is obvious why this barrel was specifically chosen to be a Lou Pepe.

The feel is incredibly smooth, with a great lingering aftertaste that continues to develop long after each sip.

On a night with many great beers on the table, this was without a doubt the highlight of the evening for me. This is one of my all-time favorite beers.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

4415,"2012-03-25",3.6,"Poured into a tulip. Brewed in 2008, bottled September 8th, 2010. I had a 2010 non-LP Kriek a few months ago and it was quite an ass-puckering experience. I hope this is a little less caustic.

3.5 A: Lightly hazed deep cherry mahogany color. Two and a half fingers of pink, fizzy head. Retention isnt so great and no lacing is left.

4.0 S: Im a bit surprised. This is way more funky than fruity/tart. Musty basement type funk dominates with rotting wood and old sweatsocks. Cherry is surprisingly faint for how ""young"" this is. Mildly tart with mild to moderate notes of lactic acid tanginess. Very light acetic acid. Its quite nice, but I was expecting a bit more depth.

4.5 T: The cherry definitely comes out more in the taste. Mildly tart with a big hit of cherry flavor. Again, this is much more funky than sour. Musty basement, musky large mammal, dry-rotted sweatsocks, decaying wood, and apple orchard. Mild lactic acid, but its just enough to add some fruit depth. Acetic acid isnt really detectable. 

3.5 M: Medium body. Carbonation is on the higher end, but its fine except that it isnt very spritzy. Also could use a bit more creaminess. Super smooth though.

4.0 D: What a completely different experience than what I had with the regular Kriek! This one is not only palatable, but also mighty tasty. Im not too crazy about the price of this though.

4415,"2012-03-12",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2012 From notes.  First reviewed 9/20/2011.  2008 vintage on tap in a Cantillon long stemmed flute at Zwanze Day.

The pour is a hazy cherry color, hazy enough that I cant see through the narrow glass. The head is a pink ring that never bubbles up or really fades.

The aroma is full of cherries, slightly on the tart side, slightly sweet, with a little bit of straw and barnyard funk in the back. 

Up front, light toasted grains roll into sweet cherries. Gradually the flavor turns sour. It never becomes too acidic, and the sour is more tannic and dry as opposed to vinegary. The finish is somewhat sour but fairly clean.

For a lambic, the carbonation and body feel to be right in the middle of the spectrum. Moderately sour, slightly dry. This does not really cause salivation or puckering.

This is my second time having this vintage, and although I really appreciate the quality of the beer, the lack of intense funkiness or puckering sour keeps me from loving it. I was definitely in the minority of people who did not enjoy this as the favorite of the day.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

4415,"2012-02-03",4.3,"This version of Lou Pepe Kriek is from 2006.  It pours a very dark red color.  A light white head forms but quickly fizzes away to what you see in the picture.  When I took my first smell I was very put off.  Its hard to explain but the beer smelled, well rotten.  Like rotten eggs and cabbage.  Ok maybe not that bad but I think you get the picture.  But as I let it sit for a while the real goodness came out.  The sourness stings the nose, beautiful hints of wood, cherries, vinegar.  I fell in love with the aroma. 

 Now from how sour the nose was,  I thought I would get blasted in the taste, but it wasnt like that.  Ive heard some Cantillon brews are just extremely sour and I cant wait to try some but this one was more of a nice balanced sourness mixed in with the oak, cherries, and barnyard funk.

Aroma is wonderful. Not as much cherry as the 100% but still pretty good. Classic Cantillon sour aroma with great lactic and slight acetic notes.

Taste is surprisingly smooth with only subtle cherry flavors. I tried this immediately after the 100% Kriek and if I were to do it again I would reverse the order. The tartness is nice and the lactic character highlights a nice cherry flavor. I wanted it to be stronger overall but this was amazing. I cant wait to try my 2005. Yum.

The aroma is sour cherries. It is not overly funky or have the typical barnyard funk. The sour is more in the form a naturally tart fruit as opposed to mold. Its a little disappointing in his regard. 

The taste is dead from start to finish. As you start to swallow you finally get some sourness hit you but its much to late and not balanced at all with any amount of sweetness from the cherries. At the very very end after you swallow you get a little sweet cherry.

The feel is on the lighter side, but it does have quite a dry finish that makes you pucker.

À lil, les bulles sont vitaminées et terminent leur course dans un certain bouillonnement.  Au nez, les arômes de la levure sauvage sont transpercés par des effluves de petites cerises surettes.  Les cerises se manifestent sous une forme vinaigrée et, en réchauffant, permettent des vapeurs légèrement sucrées.  Des notes boisées finissent par se manifester.  Le goût est tout aussi intéressant avec des notes franches de levure sauvageonne et avec des bons fruits surets chargés de bonnes saveurs acides et de sucre naturel.  Tout simplement magnifique.  En bouche, le liquide a un corps moyen-léger avec une effervescence increvable et une texture mince somme toute efficace.  La finale est superbe sur des notes surettes et fruitées.

A: Pours an absolutely beautiful rich, dark cherry color with a towering bright pink head that settles into a nice pink ring around the edges of the glass. Perhaps the most beautiful beer I have ever seen.

S: The initial nose is a lovely bright cherry aroma with a little bit of sweetness followed by a wonderful tartness. A little bit of acid in the nose, but it appears as if most of this character is coming from the cherries.

T: Tart cherries and a bit of a puckering feeling as a result. A nice, crisp acidity comes through, and it goes down really smoothly. Cherries are absolutely the dominant flavor without much else coming through. Perfect balance between the sweetness and tartness within the cherries, especially alongside the slight acidity that comes through as well.

M: Light to medium-bodied with just the right touch of carbonation. Very elegantly balanced.

D: Supremely drinkable. This is one I would love to quaff back all day long.

Aroma: The nos is funky with a good bit of barnyard and dark cherries.  Well balanced and not overpowering.

Taste: The flavor is tremendously balanced with a nice tartness, a good bit of barnyard notes, dark cherry skins, earth, and an amazingly clean finish.  The funk and the fruit achieve a perfect balance in my mind. 
Palate: Light to medium body with high carbonation leading to a short, tart then clean finish. 
Overall: I have to say, its my favorite lambic yet.  The balance in this brew is spectacular and makes it extremely drinkable.

Updating rating for a draft at the Trappist.  2008 vintage.  Pours a darkish read with a two finger pink head with good retention that leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass.  Just beautiful.  Aroma is huge cherry.  Smells like a cherry pie.  Typical Cantillon funk, but just a background note as the cherries are front and center here.  The initial taste is sweet, juicy cherry.  Tart, but certainly not overly sour.  Perfect balance to the fruit.  A little bit of the barnyard funk, but again just a background note behind the fruit.  Nice tart finish.  Almost no astringency.  Medium body.  Medium carbonation.  I enjoyed this when I had a bottle, but on tap it is phenomenal.  Easily one of the best beers I have over had.

The nose doesnt hold the usual lambic funk, at least not to the extent of so many Cantillon beers.  There is, of course, a tartness, a certain scenery sense of fields and grass - no doubt due to the use of Brettanomyces.  Then come the aged cherries and wood, the notes of oregano and other herbs.  There too is a hint of cracked black pepper.  Rightfully its tart and acidic in the mouth.  The cherry flavours are rounded, ranging from freshly picked to old and dusty.  Its dry but smooth, with a thin body and a fine carbonation.  On the finish the cherries and wood combine for a lingering fruity taste.  Here finally a bitterness is found.

Drinkability this high is a bad thing. I like beer I can drink slowly and savor. Lambics are a fine example as their acidity forces me to prolong my enjoyment. In this sense, most Cantillon products border on the Tantric.

Tart early, then gentle seeming-sweetness and intense, brooding barnyard flavours. The flavours and sensations seem to travel around the mouth from tongue tip to mouth roof to gums and finally lips. Its sharp but remarkably mouthfilling. The cherries give the illusion of sweetness and enhance the depth of the beer. Finish becomes woodier as you drink it.

Pours an unreal, super cloudy, vibrant, deep pink/purple with a dense, light purple head that has excellent retention and lace. Aroma is light band-aid that quickly moves to baked cherry pie, freshly baked/burnt sweet cherries. Incredible. Taste is tart, not too sour, full of cherry pie. Really has no flaws at all. Soft, lactic, cherry yogurt palate. 9/5/9/5/15=4.1   750mL 2007. Pours perfectly with a creamy pink, thin head that lasts throughout. Nose is just so awesome. Soft, tart, cherries, cherry pie, raspberry yogurt. Taste is similar: a play off raspberries and sour cherries with such a soft, beautiful body it really is not even fair. This is definitely the perfect kriek. I want some everyday.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Aroma is dominated by cherry, but has huge grapefruit and lemon along with a little vanilla and a touch of funk.

Great sweet fruit up front and then a fantastic sour cherry finish. I really cant describe it much better than that.

The Lou Pepe Kriek is medium bodied and almost like thick fruit juice, but the great carbonation balances it well. Slight butteriness but always drinkable.

The aroma is interesting with a strong nose of cherries, and fresh cooked pasta.  The flavor is surprisingly well balanced between the sweet and the tart, and is quite smooth, but is quite shocking for the first few sips.  The finish is rather quick, but the tartness fades leaving behind a fantastic fruitiness.  The mouthfeel is like silk gently rolling over the tongue, very smooth.

M: The body is medium with a low, rolling carbonation and a nice dry finish.

Pours a deep dark cherry red with a two finger frothy redish pink head that has very good retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. Sporadic spots of lacing left behind. Comletely opaque with slightly visible carbonation bubbling up.

Earthy funk aroma with a blast of uber fresh tart dark cherries. It shocking how prevalent the frut still is in the nose. Lots of earthy oak and barnyard horsey funk with hits of bandaid and sweatsock but again the sweet smelling cherries balance things out nicely.

Medium body with lots of tart sour funk and the perfect amount of acidity. Again as in the aroma, the flavor is bursting with luscious tart dark cherries. I cant understand how the frut has held up so well but although this beer is funky as hell the cherries still dominate. We also sampled an 05 Lou Pepe Framboise and it was nowhere near as complex. The fruit was almost completely faded and it was insanely funky. This beer has hints of earthy oak and plenty of sour barnyard funk that balance out the cherries and sugar added but again the cherries are prominent.

A - Burgundy color with an slightly above average sized, bubbly light pink head. About average, maybe slightly below average, retention. Just a slight bit of lacing left on one side.

S - Fairly acidic, vinegar smell along with some cherry tartness. Just a slight cherry sweetness. Hints of charred oak and a muskiness. That said, it is strongly acidic and tart.

T - Initially there is a strong acidic vinegary taste and a pretty strong tart/sour cherry taste. Fairly puckering taste. This gives way to a more funky and musty taste along with a hint of oaky/woody flavor. Then more fruity flavors come out in the middle to the end of the sip. Lots of cherry, still mostly tart/sour but a touch of sweetness, and hints of raspberry and grape like flavors. After drinking it for a while, the tart and acidic flavors go down a bit and the fruitiness comes out a bit more.

M - Medium body with about average carbonation. Fairly creamy and smooth but definitely has a drying and puckering finish to it.

D - Fairly good drinkability. A nice beer to sip on. Sour, tart, and acidic flavors quite prominent but there is a nice fruit taste and slight sweetness on the finish to balance that. Those make it so it is definitely a slow sipper, but an enjoyable one. Especially after it opens up a bit after drinking it for a while.

Notes: 2007 Kriek bottled 2009. Good sour beer from a brewery that knows a thing or two about sours. It was a little more acidic/tart and less fruit than I thought it may be, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. Really opened up after drinking it for a while, and the fruit started coming out a bit more. Enjoyable beer to sip, definitely recommend trying this.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

So this was bottled in 2005 and thus 4 years old in the bottle. Pours a beautiful deep ruby red color, small and bubbly but long lasting head.  Thick beer, cannot see through it.  This Lou Pepe is very different from most of the Cantillon lineup.  Its just not so ""Cantillon"" with the crazy sourness and lemony bretty.  Instead there is a spicy cherry with a cherry pie crust thickness.  And of course lambic cobwebs are abound on the nose.  Its is nice to have these two characters in harmony.  The cherry is a lot more tart in the flavor.  This allows the barnyard and cobweb characteristics to really shine as well.  All this sits on your palate for a long time.

4415,"2009-04-19",4.2,"2002 vintage.  Pours a hazy ruby red grapefruit color with a small, foamy, light pink head.  A glassy surface emerges in the center as the foam recedes, while scant, wet spots of lace mark the glass randomly.  The nose shows a classic Cantillon profile, dusty horseblanket funk overtones alongside dry, citric acidity, tannic cherry skins, and musty, wet cave stones.  Grapefruit and apricot are fully detectable, even though cherry is the primary focus.  In short, it smells fantastic.  As expected, the flavor is strikingly sour and acidic, notes of aged Balasmic vinegar joining the tart kriek and citrus fruit, with more musty horseblanket and earthy, mineral components.  Soured, saturated wood, impart a soft, oaky vanilla taste that pairs well with the cherry.  Dry, almost parching, puckering, and tingly on the tongue and the back of the throat, each sip begs the next.  Like most things Cantillon, this is a standout.

Pours a hazy cherry red with brown hints and a big fluffy pink head that stays on as a cap for the duration.

The aroma is initially funky but as it warms the cherries come out a little bit more, more tart than sweet, but definitely there.  There is a bit of sugary sweetness in there as well but the funk and acidic vinegar is pretty strong.

The taste has the same acidic funkiness as the aroma with a combined tartness from the cherries up front that puckers the lips from the outset.  After the initial kick, the sugary sweetness of the cherries makes an appearance along with a bit of brown sugar.  But the finish brings back the sourness and funk.

The mouthfeel is dry and puckering with good carbonation and medium bodied.

Once again, Cantillon has produced a beer that I enjoy but has really kicked up the vinegar sourness to point that it takes over the cherry presence.  Still, very good.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

4415,"2008-10-04",4.3,"Sours, real Belgian sours are a love/hate relationship. As a beer drinker, you either love them or hate them. Some start out hating them and then come to love them, but some just never develop that palate or almost fanatical love for real mouth-puckering Belgian sours. Once you go sour, you never go back, and like euphoria, it draws you ever deeper into her fold and I am happier and more blessed for it.

Cantillon Lou Pepe Pure Kriek is a bottle of delicious pinkish mouth-puckering and watering sour Belgian delight. I can’t think of any better way to describe, and as I write my review, I find myself wishing I had a glass or two to enjoy while I do so.

She pours a cloudy-white punch red with some nice powdery sediment in the finish. Her nose is aglow with sour cherry and raspberry notes. I imagine fields of under-ripe green cherries and raspberries being plucked and crushed right before my eyes as the aroma overwhelms my senses. My first quaff is a sour one-two punch reminding me of the sugar-free lollipops the dentist used to give out which I abhorred, and yet as an aspect of Cantillon’s Lou Pepe Pure Kriek I can’t imagine a more perfect flavor. Not to be outdone, hints of sweet concentrated sugar and sour-unripe berries march right alongside. Her body is light and lingers with but a wee bit of a dry finish as my tastebuds immediately water and demand another quaff. I happily oblige of course, and some sour pink grapefruit notes join the unripe cherries and dark berries to further delight all of my senses. As I finish my Cantillon Lou Pepe Pure Kriek, I can’t help but feel a tinge of sorrow, knowing that our time together is almost over, but I shall always remember her with a twinkle in my eye and an empty glass ready for another filling.

I don’t get to enjoy too many real sour Belgians, whether they are Krieks or Lambics or any of the other fruit flavored sour varieties, but of the ones I have had so far, hands down the Lou Pepe Pure Kriek from Cantillon is my personal favorite. While her thrown may get ousted one day, she shall never travel far from my favor.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

4415,"2008-08-17",4.2,"Vintage 2005; bottled 2005.  A bloody red pour, thick and silty, with a frothy pink foam making it seem lighthearted, if only for a moment.  Stable and cheese aroma with a fat cherry skin sweetness.  A hint of brown sugar and a brazen dry wood tannin presence to balance the funk, briefly; but, the musty cave and farm aromas tend to outlast the characters of the malts and fruit, in minerals, gouda rind, a funky blend of mildew and cinnamon, and rotten fruit.  The sharpness and foulness it shows is arresting, but it seems a little young yet; many of the older Cantillons in my memory are notably more settled in the nose, allowing the nuances ample spotlight but filtering them through a laid-back smoothness.  Thats really a very small complaint, though; the seabreeze saltiness and peppery briny qualities are forceful, and characteristically attention-commanding.
 
Flavor is more notable for its splintery wooden dryness than for its sourness.  And its a barren flavor; not an oaken sweetness or a spirit-imbued depth, but a harsh, dirty, rotten wood in rainwater kind of woodiness.  The natural acidity of the lambic and fleshy qualities of the cherry engender a hugely tannic, almost blood-textured wine-like impression.  The spice of cinnamon resting on apples, cherries, and blood oranges provides a lovely sweetening dust, momentarily, before a veritable flood of balsamic vinegar washes over it and suffocates it unmercifully, and with malice.  The wooden bitterness creates a hard complimentary flavor to the wild acidity of the cherries, and it really composes itself well, if certainly with a somewhat harrowing countenance.

Body is incredibly full while being quite lean.  Firmly carbonated, staunch and tight, and enamel-eating in acidity, though the thickness of the malt and cherry characters is somewhat more prominent than the more simple acidity often found in a flanders red or a gueuze.  Finishes in a clinical harshness of vinegar, cheese and blood, with extreme puckering length.  Again, the Cantillon expression of the style, especially when comparably young, is one of naked exposure to the wilderness in all its violence and glory.  Its memorable, and its monumental.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

4415,"2008-07-05",4.3,"Review from 2006.  Bottle from 1999. 

Nice red color with a pink-ish head that dissipated leaving only a ring around the glass. Smell was certainly sour, had some barnyard funk and very tart cherries; I have not seemed to care for other beers with some of these characteristics, but this one is very nice. Taste is much of the same, but its just put together so well that I can’t help but love it. Light bodied, but thankfully not bone dry; carbonation was light-medium. This was definitely a joy to drink, I think I’ll be searching out more Cantillon; hopefully they can match up with this one.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

4415,"2008-06-24",4.9,"Thanks to, uh, me for sharing. Perfect cloudy cherry red body with a great pink head (thats what she said..). The smell is of fantastic fresh cherries with great funk, sour, and sweet notes. Nice honey, bright dry hops, a slight mineral/iron note, and a strong vinegar tone. The taste is super dry, very acetic, fantastically funky and super sour. Cherries, raspberries, sulfur, mineral, vinegar, cranberries, bread, and an almost gingery, cinnamon spiciness. The irony aftertaste lingers for hours, and I love it. Oak, rubber, and barnyard notes appear as it warms. This is almost exactly what a kriek should taste like.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","santos999"

The aroma is sweet and funky with a mild cherry all covered with mineral ice.  A bit of cough drops too.  The first taste hit me like a piece of sour warhead candy.  A vinegar funky old fermenting cherry flavor.  Despite this, the sweetness of the cherries really does shine through.  There is some antiseptic mineral flavor near the finish.  As it warms up, the minerals come out even more.  Very light body, however, too much body would probably make this more than I could handle.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Naka"
4415,"2008-06-16",4.5,"750mL bottle, vintage 2004.  Pours a dark, pitty red-raspberry / burgundy color; decently formed, light-pink head with fine-bubbled lacing.  Loads of fresh cherries and red raspberries in the aroma, surrounded by funky citrus, cheese, and lightly toasted wood notes; very clear, enjoyable demonstration of fruit; nothing overly acidic or jaw-clenching, at this age.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: intense bing cherries, red fruits (strawberries and red raspberries), and intensely funked citrus, with solid levels of acidity and sourness; this is actually softer than I expected it to be, which is beneficial to a fruit character as clear and excellent as this; very nice balance of cherry and citrus notes; some pittiness, skins, and mouthwatering acidity.  Lengthy finish; tart citrus, sour cherries, and just a ton of lasting dryness, funk, and fruit.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

I guess on a sourness scale of 1 to 10 this rates a 7.   Lots of cherry tartness, really like drinking sour cherry juice.

4415,"2008-05-27",4.6,"2005 vintage.  Pours a beautiful red, more red than usual Kriek or I just could be forgetting that others are this red too but either way it looks gorgeously bright.  A fizzy pink head forms then quickly and audibly dissipates to the thinnest ring of bubbles.  Brettanomyces noticeable from several feet away.  When inhaling close to the glass I get very intense cherry aromas.  Full, round, juicy cherries, the most Ive experienced in a fruit lambic.  Brett is obvious underneath providing a nutty and lemony character.  The more this breathes and the warmer it becomes the funkiness increases with elements of horse and barnyard coming out.  Some intense leather characteristics are also noted.  So far this is the best lambic Ive ever smelled.  Just a huge cherry aroma blended perfectly with Lambic funk.  Taste is, wow, super acidic.  Very lemon like.  Tartness and sourness is actually not that high.  Its there, to be sure, but the acidity blends into an intense fruit flavor that is more like tart cherries than the sourness I associate with a good Geueze.  This is like eating straight cherry pie filling.  Much juicier and less dry than I was expecting.  A long, tart and sweet finish lingers on the tongue for many minutes.  This is certainly the best fruit flavor Ive experienced in a lambic.  The cherries really stand out on their own among all the funk and acidity.  This is just amazing.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Basically, this is drinkable, but the all too familiar smells overwhelm the tartness of the fruit.  My recipe for a cheap fruit lambic: buy a bottle of wheat beer and pour it into your glass.  Then add some fruit and take a laxative.  Head to your thrown and bring the beer with you.  Enjoy drinking as the gasses from your bottom side permeate the air.

Flavor is more of the same, the best blend of the gueuze and the fruit I have had to date. The champagne-like lambic blend has neither been overrun by the cherries, nor is it so powerful  that you may as well be drinking a straight gueuze.

Aroma is all sour cherry and funk that just assaults your senses.  The sour dry, barnyard is so appealing.  Jesus, this aroma used to repel me; what happened?  
Taste is super sour at first, just very unripe cherry and crazy yeast profile.  The finish is slightly bitter, funky, and bright cherry- like you have the first bite of a sour cherry, but as you slowly chew it the cherry develops and matures into a ripe, well-rounded fruit.
This beer is amazing.  
It looks like cranberry juice, tastes like sweet/sour cherry, barnyard, and smells very similar with a lot of cherry and funk.

Pours an extremely slightly hazed garnet color with a pink head that doesnt stick around. Smells like when you have a bandaid on and it gets really wet and you dont take it off for a while, but when you do, your skin smells funny. Antiseptic smell. Also a fair amount of fruit and a very mild yeast influence. Flavor is of the best aged lambics. Mildly funky at first with a typical sour punch in the mouth that isnt very powerful. Definite wood influence on the palate. Calmly there, but not overpowering at all. Feel is typical. Not a ton of bubble, but a little bit. Extremely drinkable.

I picked this up over Christmas time in Rockford, IL.  It was a bit pricy so I didnt want to drink it for less than a good reason.  In this case it was to ccelebrate the GTMW and clear some cellar space.  I can always pick up another bottle and store it until my stomach learns to not churn after two sips of such wonderful beer.
Aroma / Appearance - The nose is very tart cherries as one would expect from such a style.  It was almost like cough syrup but without the sugary sweetness or thick consistancy.  The body looked almost perfect - translucent medium red as if someone blended red Twizzlers into a liquid form.  A bubbly thin head tried to persist but was quickly swallowed by the acidity below.
Flavor / Palate - Now we get to the painful / delicious part of the story.  I was only able to drink about an ounce and a half of this before my stomach began to rebel.  Next time I wont this on a mostly empty stomach.  The flavor of intensely sour cherries filled my senses.  A very funky sensation then washed down my throat dying out every corner.  Even on the way home thirty minutes later I was still parched.  This is one of the most acidic beers I have ever tried - almost like La Folie but with more funk.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Medium body with a sticky texture and lively carbonation. Heavy sour cherry flavor with a medium tart sour finish of long duration. Sour refreshing brew that was good for 2300.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
4415,"2007-03-18",4.3,"Bottle. 2001 vintage.
Pours a murky, varying, reddish coloured body with a medium-sized soapy white head. Loads of cherry, acidic seeds, vinegar, and sweet jam in the aroma. Very tart acidity, chewy fruit sharpness moving between cherries and raspberries. In the middle there is some fruit sugar and then leads into a well-attenuated long, lingering, aciditic finish.
Another great Cantillon.

4415,"2007-03-13",3.0,"In the far, far reaching netherworld of the notebook I pull out another one. Tasted way back in March 06, seems a lifetime ago. A 2003 corked seven fifty, into a shallow chalice at just on cold. Classic, candi apple red body, bright, with minute intermittent carbonation almost too fine to distinguish. A head developed off the pour, a tight, thin, wafered pad of pink to sit in charm of the beer itself. Aroma, a let down. I expected aggressive, in fact I wanted aggressive and alas, only subtlety here. A light prickle, acidic and tart, fell fruit, slight dampness of hessian but little else, no real character. Its peppery in the mouth, lively and yet delicate in body. The spritzy carbonation and tart cherry flavours cause it to bounce across the palate with so much haste it barely grips for enjoyment. It is sour, no doubt, but so, so controlled up against the likes of the Cantillon 100% Kriek. The palate so dry, it does manage to leave a feint cherry essence to linger on the lips where the saliva once dwelt. Subtle baby-spew end and fruit on dominance so much to not really be of character at all. It sadly lacks in true Lambic character, its just too subtle to be of worth. Where are the cobwebs, the must, the damp cellar, the Brett. and Lambicus. I did expect more, but hey, I love Cantillon so it is forgiven. (apologies for the overuse of the word subtle!)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Two distinct waves of flavor tickle my tongue in an intriguing fashion.  The first wave satisfies my immediate craving for a tart, sour beer, starting out dry and woody.  The second wave blows my hair back with the amazing complexity of the cherry flavor.

Funky sour aroma gives a blast of fresh cherries even 3 years (edit: 1 year) after bottling as the beer enters the mouth. Breathing through the mouth really amplifies the brilliant aroma. After a very brief cherry punch in the mouth, the beer proceeds into familiar sour lambic flavor before imparting a strong white wine muskiness in the finish. The muskiness fades as it warms, allowing more balanced flavors to shine through. More cherry in the finish as the beer coats the lips and leaves lots of flavors for the licking.

Mouthfeel is lean and dry with some mouthpuckering acidity, dry leathery character and some lingering lactic acidity.  Fruit is more prominent in the nose than in the mouth.

Intial aromas of barnyard horse maneur and sour cherries that become more earthy and baked cherry pie like as it warms.  A hint of oaky aroma and bready malt come through as well.  Also some leathery and chloroseptic like phenolic and sourness.  Flavor is definitely sour throughout.  Some corked woodiness, in the long dry finish with some baked cherry pie flavors mid palate that faint into the dryness.  Up front very sour, but it backs off a little bit shortly into the sip.  Earthy flavors thrown in for good measure.  Oddly enough, there is a touch of sugary sweetness at the very front.   Aftertaste is woody cork and dry with a hint of sour cherries.  Dry mouthfeel, very dry and puckering tannin like.  Lighter medium body, lower carbonation.  Not a big fan of sour beers, but this ones not too bad as far as they go.

75cl bottle from Cantillon. When we were given this bottle we were told it was not for sale as it was not ready for consumption yet. It didnt even have labels on it so Jean had to hand write some! We were made to promise that we would not drink it for at least 4 months. 4 and a half months later we could wait no longer and popped it open and oh my word it was worth the wait. Aroma is that of their Lou Pepe Gueuze with some added cherry (obviously) some apple and lashings of cinnamon. Wow. Bouquet is a far more suitable word than aroma. Appearance wise it is just as you would expect. A glorious mahogany cherry red body with a swiftly diminishing head.  Flavour wise it perfectly echoes the aroma. Pulp of cherries with hints of apple and lemons and plenty more cinnamon. Palate is tart and dry but not as overly barnyardy as you would maybe think. It does make moves in that direction but just before it gets over the top a wonderful thick sweet cherry finish washes in and down. Simply an amazing brew.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

4415,"2005-08-24",4.1,"2002 Draught at Moan and Dove on 8/19/2005 with Eyedrinkale and Dan Shelton.  Pours a vibrant, opaque, strawberry-pinkish red, with a bit of a ruddy-orange glow to it on the edges.  Head is thin and filmy and pinkish-cream colored, but well-retained and provides ample lacing.  Aroma is lemon juice, lemon rinds, oranges, very yogurty/lactobacillius notes, quite sour, with some sweet cherry pulp, a touch of very dry cask wood.  Thoroughly pungent and quite lovely.  Flavor begins with a woody dryness coupled with the signature lacto/pedio mix of Cantillon.  Eminently drinkable right off the bat, I waste no time in downing a glass and have to go for a second to finish my thoughts. . . and then a third later.  Anyways, the cherries were not as tart and were, perhaps, a bit too apparent for my liking.  Adding to my displeasure, somewhat, was a note of what I would best describe as ""coconut liqueur"".  I couldnt shake this taste from all three samples.  It had a syrupy, fruity, yet dryish/sour flavor to it that I havent found in any other Cantillon beer.  Could this be the syrup addition?  Maybe.  The flavor ends with plentiful cherry juice notes, more lemon and lacto notes and large dose of tartness lingering.  Mouthfeel was spot-on, as always, from this brewery.  Tiny bubbles, providing a wash of flavors over the palate and just tingly and perfect on the tongue.I dont really like that much fruit in my lambics, so Im not entirely surprised that I wasnt floored by this, but none the less, its damned good and fantastically drinkable.

4415,"2005-03-04",4.0,"2001 vintage (bottled 2003).Deep deep red colour thats as thick as raspberry jam or eczematics beetroot homebrew. Pink head which sticks around pretty well for a Cantillon brew. Typical Cantillon lambic aroma which I find really hard to describe - wood, fish & cobwebs perhaps? Dense morello cherries, vanilla, coconut, whiskey and a nice cidery character. This beer features an incredible balance between fruit, sourness and bitterness. Its not sweet but its definitely more sweet and approachable than their regular Kriek. Its lemony-sour but not overly so. I would have preferred it a little more sour but I dont think out-and-out sourness is the point of the exercise here. Its seems more like a showcase for balance, drinkability and accessibility (of course for a Cantillon beer this is all relative) and this objective is certainly achieved. The bitterness works especially well - its always perceptible but never dominant or clashing with the sourness. Theres quite a bit of cherry flavour but not as much as in the aroma. Some red wine character too. Incredible fleshy mouthfeel was great. Much like the St Lamvinus I am left with the impression of an incredibly well-brewed beer, and I did enjoy it immensely, but its a bit too styled and not rough enough to really do it for me. Perhaps Cantillon is doomed to constantly fail to impress me as much as that first, incredible bottle of Rose de Gambrinus? Or maybe not. Its still my favourite brewery.

That is why they also cap these. This pours a bright red with a thin pink head. The aroma has many things going on. It has the normal horse blanket and dusty barn character. Also vinegar, cherries and maybe a hint of hay. Absolutely wondeful to smell. The taste is equally complex and not shy in any way. It has sour vinegar, cherries, dusty dry cobwebs and leather. Later, a little bit of sweetness begins to show. It also has some dry apple core. This is very challenging and interesting.

Like I have said before, I find it very redundant to describe the flavors of almost every lambic. This particular one had a much more pronounced fruit profile than the standard Cantillon Kriek but it lacked assertion, especially with its sourness. Quite dry on the finish. Still very good and this was certainly a pleasure to consume.

Thanks to my new boss Tom at Unique Beer for sharing this from his home tap system. I didnt even know that this beer was kegged until I witnessed it myself! 
 Poured a foggy dark cherry red almost mahogany colored body and a fluffy pink head. The aroma and flavor are a pure dry tartness that resembles white grapes, basaltic vinegar, pressed pear, red apple, and mashed cherry. There is a deep crusty maltyness in every sniff and taste, with a light hint of burned sugar as well as a note of horse blanket and musty farmhouse hay. This beer is absolutely wonderful, utterly complex and showing its depth with every encounter! The only downside to this beer is what it did to my digestive tract!

Aroma is not too intense for a lambic although some of the characteristics I look for are in there. Blood orange meets cherries, strwaberries, blood, leaves, cinnamon... As it warms up, theres a solvent or toothpaste quality emerging and it seems far less complex like a minty cranberry juice. In mouth though, the cherry flavors is good and clean. Its quite sour, cherry flavored lemon juice alike, but the acidity is clearly mostly lactic. Orange fruity flavors, dry finish which is surprisingly not too astringent.

Sour ""cherry"" aroma, but I found the aroma hard to distinguish from other lambics in that for 25 bucks I do not seem to pick out my moneys worth of difference. And the flavor was dry, dry, and then when it finished, it was even drier, like grape skins. Now don't get me wrong, this is a good brew, but I wouldn't pay another 25 bucks for this one just to have as an afternoon sipping beer when I can be just as satisfied with a quality 7 dollar lambic such as the Curve Rene.","Good Beer Bar Deprived, New Jersey, USA","MaiBockAddict"

It is topped by bubbly light red to pink colored head, that never quite disappears entirely.  The carbonation is persistent, though not overly high either.  The aroma is sour and woody at first, then notes of Barnyard funk kick in.  There is a definite musty, leathery, ancient dusty room type aroma here.  At the very end I get a bit of sweet cherry notes in the nose.The tasted is softly acidic (for a Lambic) and it is accompanied by a rich body.  There is a definite dry, tart, tannic cherry note here.  The time spent on the cherries seems to have increased the body quite substantially.  This is quite good, and quite different from what I was expecting.  It is a bit softer, and a bit better integrated than the standard Cantillon beers.  It is nicely sour, with notes of citrus & vinegar.  The finish is woody and reminds me of cherry skins.  This is certainly a beer I could drink a lot of.  The cherry flavor is quite good in this beer.  There is no sticky sweetness, like that found in the more commercial versions,  instead there are these intense, chewy, mouth filling, cherry skin, dry, tart flavors that just proclaims that there are cherries in this Lambic.  I really like this, and it certainly has grown on me as I finish the bottle.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2001 Vintage. Pours VERY deep ruby with a small pink head. Nose is sour cherry and leather. VERY TART! The cherry is abundant. It's almost bordering on a sour black cherry. There's some nice sweetness about the edges to round it out a bit. Has a weakened champagne like mouthfeel and the finish is sweeter than the taste.

The aroma hints of tart cherries with some lemon and current fruit notes too. The nose also detects a major funky barnyard and leather yeast esters, oak wood, light bittersweet chocolate, and aromatic hops. The taste starts full pucker mode with tons of sour cherries attacking the palate but unlike the basic Cantillion Kriek, this beer has a good dose of malty backbone and some bitter character. The finish displays the woody and funky yeast nature of the brew. This medium-bodied brew had a dry and astringent mouthfeel, very lively and fizzy. A good fruit lambic but I must admit to liking the Lou Pepe Framboise much more.

Flavor does not let down though, certainly quite sour but with a stronger ""real"" cherry taste than in any kriek I've had.  Actually tastes like sucking on the skin of the best bing cherries, with a powerful oak character pushing through.  Very dry, finish is shorter than in many lambics, but this might be a good thing or the sourness would be painful.  Nose is getting sweeter and fuller as I continue.

The aroma keeps all of those qualities that make Cantillon so mouth-watering, in that body-odor/barnyard way that only the Chosen can appreciate.  The color from my first pours was like the sunrise, then the last glass, with the yeast, was like a thick pressing of fruit juice.  Kriek makes the best flavoring for a lambic, in my opinion, because it preseves or even enhances the saliva-stimulating sourness.  The acidity is restrained but present with each swallow, as the sourness and carbonation combine to keep it interesting as the bottle warms.  Exceedingly drinkable, keeping the fruit charm and yet aggressively tempting me as a good gueuze would.  2003 was a great year for my lambic education and what a way to end it, with this bottle, a Christmas gift from my mother-and-father-in-law: if only everyone could be as fortunate to get gifts like this.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
