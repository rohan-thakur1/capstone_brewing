4148,"2016-10-20",4.3,"Like biting into a honey glazed grape...pretty dry on the fruit side but sweet honey with a mild tropical note...bit of warmth and smooth finish","Oceanside, California, USA","Floydster"
4148,"2014-11-02",4.3,"Pours medium purple. Aroma is Sweet vinous with slight honey. Taste is new world --bold and bright from the Pyment blend without being overly sweet. Another excellent pyment from superstition.","New York, USA","tchaos"
4148,"2014-08-09",4.5,"Pours purple. Aromas of berry and red wine. Flavor is redline with hints of grape. Hints of berry, chocolate, and honey. Very nice.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
4148,"2014-04-20",4.2,"Bottle shared by daknole. Aroma of wine grapes, honey, and oak. Deep purple color. Similar to cabernet version just not as complex but getting a hint of chocolate. Another winner By superstition","Alabama, USA","thebitterendaz"
4148,"2014-04-20",4.2,"Bottle share courtesy of Dak, thanks! It pours with a clear deep purple inspired body that has some nice legginess. The aroma offers up sweet rich honey sweetness, a sliver of honey waxiness and then red wine and earthy dark fruitiness. Cool. The taste has smooth rich honey blended with nectar sweet berry to grape notes and smooth dry rich red wine. To midway it gets into a dash of chocolate nuanced with grape sort of berry and currant like rich nectar fruity sweetness that is tempered by some muted tannin like dryness. Nice.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4148,"2014-04-15",3.9,"Bottle shared during a mead tasting hosted by daknole. Sweet honey and alcohol dominate the nose with red grapes and a bit of blackberries; however, the aroma is not as rich as it is for the Cabernet/Syrah version. The taste is sharper than expected, with hot Syrah wine booziness, an earthy wood note and an abundance of honey sweetness. Slick mouthfeel. Good, but the Cabernet/Syrah version trumps this mead by far.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
4148,"2014-04-14",4.4,"Deep reddish purple pour. Aroma is straight up grapes and honey with subtle berry and earthy notes. The grapes really come though in the nose and the flavor. The taste is grape, sweet honey, ripe berries. This is a very well balanced mead and my favorite in the Aphrodisia series","Chandler, Arizona, USA","jntfan1978"
4148,"2014-04-13",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2015 Slightly boozy smell (its 16% ABV) along with light grape. Taste is much deeper grape than the smell would suggest with delicous juicy grape jelly taste, honey, and a bit of alcohol taste and warmth at the end, but not so much that it is unpleasant. This was my favorite variant of the four Aphrodisia meads that Ive had. I prefer sweet jammy tastes tastes to dry tastes. If you are looking for sweet like I am, I would go for the Syrah/Grenache, then Pinot Noir, then Syrah/Cabernet, and then the straight Cabernet. If you like dry red wine (I dont), then the reverse order will probably fit your tastes more.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
4148,"2014-04-12",3.8,"Smells like red wine which I don't enjoy. However the flavor has the complexities and flavors of red wine without all of the tannins and acidity. Very tasty!

4148,"2014-04-12",4.0,"Deep red to purple pour with an aroma of berries and some earth. Taste is very desk berry forward. Really tasty mead.","Chandler, Arizona, USA","JPDurden24"
4148,"2014-04-12",4.0,"Pours a deep red like cranberry juice. This is a very well balanced mead. Nice sweet base with the grapes showing their pretty little faces. This is just wonderful tasting.","Arizona, USA","kcorum10"
4148,"2014-04-12",4.6,"Pours a purple color with a floral grape notes. Ripe grapes are ever predominant in the taste as well as a little honey adding to the sweetness. A slight alcohol burn going down, but so nice. A great mead if you are red wine lover!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","MrBrightside53"
4148,"2014-04-12",4.5,"I love the smell of this! Very fragrant and fruity. I could smell this all day. The taste is great, like a sweet red wine with honey. Little bit of burn going down but a good sweet balanced flavor.","","girlvsplanet"
4148,"2014-04-12",4.5,"Purple pour. Aroma is spot on grapes and honey. The grapes really shine in the nose and the flavor. I get supple grape flavors, sweet honey, ripe berries. This is stellar. Really well done. Incredible.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
