1624,"2012-04-22",2.4,"Meh...a little thin and weak for my taste. Aroma was average at best. Grape, sulfur and grainy rice. Pour was a murky light gold. Taste was melon, cucumber and sweet rice with an extremely oily mouth feel that coats the throat as it goes down. Light vegetal aftertaste. Not impressive.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
1624,"2011-12-29",3.1,"My girlfriend liked this one a lot.  I however did not.  The sake pours to a clear body with some legs.  Aroma is strong on butter and mango.  The flavor has a light buttery white grape and light zin character.  Some floral components.  Palate is very buttery.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
1624,"2010-08-03",3.3,"Placid clear yellow, almost white.  Aroma is vinous and fruity with a bit of socky funk.  Taste is the same with alcohol apparent, but not to a great degree, with muscat and cheese flavors delicately commingled. $15/750ml","portland, Oregon, USA","Arayaga2"
1624,"2010-05-04",3.2,"Bottle. Pours a slightly yellow tinted clear color with ok legs. Notes of melons, blueberries, and bread yeast. A good alternative to vodka haha. Basic mouthfeel and medium length finish.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
1624,"2008-09-28",2.6,"pale yellow color with very little legging. aroma is all alcohol and it’s bite... notes of rice, florals, light yeast and a grape/apple-y fruitiness. not a whole bunch going on in the flavor profile... rice, fusel and mild grape-y fruitiness come up. huge harsh burn on the finish. medium body. the front palate has an slick texture but as it passes over the tongue it quickly dries out and gets tingly from the abv% beast. leaves the chest warm for sure...","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"
1624,"2008-08-25",2.6,"Pours still and clear with a pale, yellowish tint.  Thin legging is quickly fleeting.  The aroma shows sweet rice, cucumber, melon, cream, and dry koji.  There’s a touch of fusel alcohol as well, indicating the impending heat.  Flavors are lightly fruity, with cucumber showing mostly.  Semi-dry, funky koji shows on the finish. The mouthfeel is thin but slick, with lingering alcoholic heat burning on the way down.  This one is not very impressive.  Lacking complexity and subtlety.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1624,"2008-01-19",2.9,"Let me start off by saying that I aint no sake expert.Typical sake aroma, sweet rice and fruit aroma. Taste is off sweet fruit and cheap sake. Goes down somewhat less smooth than some others I have tried. At $11.99 a bottle it is good value.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1624,"2007-06-08",2.9,"Ive enjoyed this one very much, its got a strong presence of rice and alcohol. it does have a thin but oily palate. I really enjoyed this one.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
1624,"2007-06-08",1.6,"The aroma has sulfer, cork, rice, fruit, and alcohol. The appearance is clear yellow. The flavor is like the aroma with plenty of alcohol. The palate is thin and oily. The aroma makes this one bad.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1624,"2006-10-07",3.2,"Chilled bottle from Party Source. Poured clear pale color with legs. Light green apple, melon and alcohol aroma. Light to medium body with a dry texture. Medium sweet green apple and rice flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1624,"2006-06-24",3.1,"poured a pale yellow color there was a slight fruity aroma but nothing disintinct.    Flavor was a fruity mix of pear and cucumber.  Seemed to be slightly syrupy on the tounge.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
1624,"2006-06-11",3.0,"750 ml bottle, served cold. Clear, almost colorless. Fruity aroma and flavor with a warm splash of alcohol. Melon and honey, as advertised. Sweet and warm without being harsh.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"
1624,"2005-02-12",3.4,"Chilled bottle.  Yellowish color.  Soft aromas of rice and pear.  Flavor is soft and somewhat sweet.  Alcohol is muted.  Overpowered by sushi in a spicey sauce.","Alabama, USA","11026"
1624,"2005-01-18",3.9,"750 ml bottle. The ABV on said bottle read 14.8%. Thus far, my favorite from this ""Sakery"". Very mellow and subtle melon like aroma. Flavor is light and gentle, with very pleasant  melon indertones. Very easy on the palate, and wat too easy to drink. This will not pair well with flavorful food as it will get dominated by most anything.","Good Beer Bar Deprived, New Jersey, USA","MaiBockAddict"
1624,"2005-01-18",3.8,"Clear in color like white wine color. Soft tasting. Flavor of melon and honey. Very well balanced. Very fruity aroma.  Enjoyable. Good paired with pastas.","paramus, New Jersey, USA","mkobes"
1624,"2004-09-02",3.0,"This gets appearance points just for having really nice legs and a great silky floral aroma.  The mouthfeel is very dry and slightly oily with mild flavors that make it very balanced and easy to drink.  Not over the top on the fruits either, sort of a muscat, melon flavor going on, with just a bit of delictable alcohol in the finish.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","harlequinn"
1624,"2004-07-11",3.2,"clear, oily sides. Aroma is very fruity with passionfruit & pomegranite. The flavor is moderately dry with a smooth tail & mild very dry finish. A touch of alcohol is detectable through the exhale.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1624,"2004-07-01",2.4,"Clear, filtered pear. Fast-dripping legwork. Wafts of plummy alcohol, overripe white grapes, banana, sweet rice, and bubblegummy yeast notes. Watery, dull, and completely lifeless on the tongue. Slick and lightly gritty, to boot. Gentle melon flavors are smothered by the astringent alcohol. Hints of damp cotton in the finish clash with the astringency as vague honeydew flavors fail to quell the sweetness. Its got a decent aroma, but its all downhill from there. Im beginning to wonder if all filtered Sake is this bad. Barely drinkable.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1624,"2004-06-30",3.1,"Bottle. Fairly crisp and just a bit more sweet than dry. Bland honeydew melon texture and flavor. Much better cold than at room temp or warm. The finish is that of Nutrisweet-laden Bubbalicious gum.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
1624,"2004-03-16",2.1,"One of the more yellow sakes I've had in a while.  Tasting this side-by-side with the Momokawa Diamond and Pearl, what you notice is that the Ruby is the lightest yellow of the three and has a very faint sugary aroma.  This honeyish sake is quite sweet and a touch fruity.  Very little alcohol presence at 15%, which is a nice surprise.  Lack of complexity keeps it from being competitive with Japanese Junmais.  The taste is of light fruit and honey.  OK.  My bottle was a bit past its prime.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
1624,"2003-12-20",4.0,"Slightly yellowish.  Fruity, good complex rice/koji flavor. Some koji on the aroma, but mostly light fruity notes. I like this more than I remembered it.","Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, USA","Admiral"
