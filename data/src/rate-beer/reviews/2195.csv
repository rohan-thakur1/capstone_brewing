2195,"2015-12-06",3.6,"355 ml bottle bought at The Bottle Shop in Sai Kung.
Looks: Translucent orange honey colour; One finger head and crumpety white foam which lasts for 1 minute. Excellent sticky lacing with very slight carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and sweet full malt, with strong honey, floral nectar, caramel, toffee, bread, yeast, citron tea and thin grass.

Taste: Strong sweet malt, with caramel, floral, strong honey, strong molasses, thick bread, yeast, moderate lemon, light bitter hops and light grass. 

Body: Clos eot medium. Slick and smooth palate.

Mouth Feel: Rich maltyness in a solid and fairly creamy caramel background. Lots of good floral honey sweetness you dont find cloying nor getting tired of, soaked with light lemon and good breadyness. Excellent! 

Hoppiness: Floral nectar, citron tea and thin grass in nose. Floral, moderate lemon and light grass in taste. Bitterness is fairly light for an abrupt, light astringent sweet malty finish.

 After Taste: Fairly dry. Nice sweet and light bitter to mouth.	

Comments: This ones aroma and taste is so similar to Neuschwansteiner Edelmärzen - Solid maltyness with strong and likeable floral and honey elements in aroma and taste and just enough hops for a relaxng experience. The only difference is that this cost a lot less for easy enjoyment. Will buy again for sure. Lovely!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

2195,"2015-09-20",3.7,"This was poured into a mug.
The appearance was a semi-golden bronzed copper color with a nice transparency about it. Carbonation could be seen rising to fill a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minutes worth of white foamy lacing.
The smell started off with a slight roasty nutty to caramel maltiness over a slight herbal/eh, maybe somewhat earthiness to it.
The taste was mainly the same with a moderate earthy bitterness to balance. Theres a quick dry aftertaste.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionable feel about it. Carbonation runs fairly light. Theres a fairly sticky smoothness about this one, good, nothing bad.

Some light floral notes add levity and theres a touch more soaked grain/biscuit character. No alcohol and no flaws, though.Simple, honey-flavored malt notes up front slowly transition in to a slightly maltier caramel. Moderately bitter hop character is herbal (very dry, nearly astringent) and with some perfume-like floral notes. Quite carbonated and with a watery texture with minimal malt lingering; almost a sticky orange-laden caramel. Like the berliner, its fine but just dosent seem all that oktoberfest-like/berliner-like. Missing a richer malt flavor.

This is a slightly hazed orange w/ a small head of fine white bubbles. This is a solid amber lager w/ lots of tasty, bready malt character, just a touch of caramel sweetness and a nice floral note from the hops. Above all things, it is not all kinds of godforsaken sweet like a lot of Oktoberfests but is still quite malty and flavorful. This is not done often enough. This is a full bodied brew w/ a crisp finish w/ some lingering Munich malt character and firm bitterness to blance. This is a very nice beer.

2195,"2014-10-09",3.7,"Jacks Abby is a brewery that specializes in making ale styles as lagers, so youd think theyd be able to knock a traditional lager style out of the park. Their Copper Legend is their take on the Oktoberfest/Marzen style, though it drinks more like some kind amber lager. It tastes and drink fine, but its not all that true to the style.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a mug. There was no freshness date. It cost $2.45 ($0.20 per ounce).

Appearance: Bright amber/yellow hue. Sparse carbonation visible. Pours to a small, off-white, soapy head which dissipates and leaves no lacing.

Smell: Mild nose overall with faint hints of light malty sweetness.

Taste: The first thing I notice about Jacks Abby Copper Legend is how sweet it is. A rich, honey-like flavor jumps out right away. Theres a slight graham cracker flavor that adds another component to this sweet palette. Biscuity malts are quite present as well, giving the beer an English character rather than something German. Usually, Oktoberfest brews have toffee and caramel, but they arent present here. There is a distinct hop presence throughout due to the use of Noble hops. Surprisingly citrusy rather than spicy or dry. This isnt what you expect from the style, though the uniqueness is commendable.

Drinkability: For a lager, this beer has the mouthfeel and body of an ale (though thats true of a lot of Jacks Abby beers). Copper Legend is only moderately carbonated, so theres a slightly thicker viscosity to the beer than most of the style. Its not crisp and effervescent, though it is smooth. It probably could have a little more robustness for 5.7% ABV, though it feels like a much lighter beer than it is. Its tempting to throw back several of these on a Sunday afternoon while watching football.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

2195,"2013-08-27",3.9,"The beer pours a fiery caramel color, moving between amber and red tones. It pours with a lovely head of medium sized, lightly yellowed, slightly rocky bubbles that sit at a half fingers width and slowly fizzle away. The head leaves a negligible lacing on the sides of the glass. In body the beer is lager-clean but darker, with a lazy stream of bubbles working to the top of the beer, and no particles present (just as there shouldnt be in this style). On the nose, the beer smells spicy with a beautiful caramel malt blanket on the back of the smell. The caramel is layered and sweet, gracing the nose with just a touch of maple syrup and biscuit notes, and the hops are properly noble with a strong spice character, alongside fresh cut grass notes. The malt is the bigger player in the nose, however. On the tongue, the beer tastes mellow, with light bitters and sweetness which give way to a nice dry finish and only the slightest hint of acidity. In flavor, the beer tastes remarkably similar to several ESBs Ive had. The flavor begins as sweet caramel malt with a touch of apple juice, this moves into sweet bread, and then quickly to stale bread, and then bitter, herbal hops with just a touch of residual sweetness from the malt. Toffee notes also dance across the middle of the palate. The finish is dry, but is a nice blend of the malt and hops. In the mouth the beer feels medium in body, with a light, syrupy mouthfeel and softer carbonation that gives a quick bite and then caresses the tongue with velvet. The mouth is left dry except for a very faint trail of saliva, though it is by no means bone-dry. Overall this is a great beer to drink a lot of, its not too sweet, its not too bitter, and sits on the palate nicely with enough flavor to make you want another sip, but not enough to fill you up, etc This is a good drinking beer, and would work very well in an Oktoberfest environment.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

2195,"2013-08-12",3.2,"50cl bottle. Clear light amber body with medium off-white head. Aroma is medium sweet, spicy, bread/caramel, light lager yeast. Taste is moderately sweet, bread, some lager yeast, spicy, caramel, light earthy/orange. Light-medium body, low carbonation.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2195,"2013-08-08",3.7,"Was expecting a darker pour for an Oktoberfest but this was more of a ""Copper Legend"" color, big thick off white head Lower hop and more malt tatses, smooth, medium body. Good tasting.","Holliston, Massachusetts, USA","berniecarbo"
2195,"2013-01-18",3.3,"In short: A very clean, easy to drink but ultimately unexciting semi-toasted lager.
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed fresh a few days after it was picked-up at the brewery.  A few dozen of bottles graciously offered by the brewery to someone who was coming up to the HF Harvest 2012 Festival.  The bottles were then spread around, big thanks to the brewery and the gentleman who acted as the middle-man.
The look: Clear amber body topped by a medium off-white head.
In long: Nose has fresh cereals and this typical german-style pale lager that I can never put into words.  Taste is semi-toasted fresh smooth cereals, a bit of crème-caramel, light iced-tea notes, leafy hops.  Unlike most Jacks Abby this one just didnt out, very clean and easy to drink for sure, but a bit characterless, not much excitement.  An inoffensive quality lager.  22 ratings I entered today, and my boss just told me I cannot spend my day at work just entering ratings on ratebeer, I dont know why he said that, thats a stupid thing to say, because yes I can, I just did.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2195,"2012-10-31",3.6,"This was an OK beer in my book. Easy drinker, nothing super special. Somewhat thick mouthfeel, maybe a touch of honey sweetness. Good to try, would try again, but probably would not go out to find it specifically.","Massachusetts, USA","LeRose"
2195,"2012-10-17",3.6,"Mild, malty aroma.  Flavor is smooth with a little caramel, roast and nut.  Finish is smooth, with a little roast bitterness.  Nothing over the top here, but a very enjoyable beer, especially if youre having more than one","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","annunz123"
2195,"2012-10-03",3.3,"50cl bottle pours a transparent, bright orange with some fluffy white head that faded fast.  Aromas of dried leaves, malt, bread, crackers, a little bit of lemony tea, some honey.  Flavor is classic marzen, malty, sweet, crackers, bread, yeast, some light lemon, a little bit of orange zest, more of that lemony tea, some parsnip.  Medium bodied, dry finish.  Classic.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
2195,"2012-09-30",3.2,"500ml bottle in a glass.  Pours copper with an off-white head.  Aroma of toasted and pale malts plus some floral hops.  Flavor the same.  Average texture.  A decent October fest beer.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
2195,"2012-09-30",3.6,"16 oz. bottle paid $3.99. Used a mug Can you guess the color?? Yes, a hazy copper with nice head retention. Laced the mug well. Nose is weak with a German type hop and mild malt. Palate is clean and smooth with a hop crispness in the finish. Malt is balanced with the hops nicely; palate has a nice liveliness from the carbonation. Well made brew.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2195,"2012-09-29",3.2,"Bottle late night after the VIP session at Hill Farmsteads Harvest Festival.  Pours a clear amber gold with a thin white head.  Grain, lager yeast, more grain.  Medium bodied, sweet grainy toast.  Bitterness comes early, earthy long grain.  Bitterness and toast.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
2195,"2012-09-28",3.9,"Bright orange color - long lasting white head. Tastes of cinnamon and floral notes. Medium body and carbonation. Like other Jacks Abby products, brewed with a lager yeast that makes it a more authentic Octoberfest than those brewed by some other craft brewers. Ill be purchasing this one again.","Jaffrey, New Hampshire, USA","hampale"
2195,"2012-09-26",3.5,"Bottle shared at HF Harvest Fest. Clear gold pour, white head, aroma is grainy, light spicy notes, malty, I can almost smell pumpkin beer in here, definitely german. Taste is slightly sweet, a bit thick bodied which goes against the point according to me but anyway. Still very decent for an oktoberfest.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2195,"2012-09-23",3.3,"500 mL Bottle, purchased at Yankee Spirits - Attleboro, MA. Plain malty and cheerio aroma. Flavors focus on a light Munich malt with a sharp bitterness. I find the malt flavrs muddled and watered down with out of balance bitterness. Ok.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
2195,"2012-09-16",2.3,"big bottle 4 pack. Very nice rich copper color with well retained off white head. Aroma and taste is rich malt and a little tin. Much lighter than other marzen I have had but also a beer that has a much more lager body and taste to it. I can see how people can drink the large steins of this.",", Massachusetts, USA","TheGent"
2195,"2012-09-05",3.0,"First dissapointment from this brewery.  Tastes metallic, hay, bran flakes, and not rich and malty like i want from a marzen.  Just off.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
2195,"2012-09-01",3.6,"Bottle.   Notes of rustic fall leaves.   Toasted caramel.  Cracker bright leafy earthy dough.     Nice.   Like.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
2195,"2012-08-30",3.9,"Pours deep gold into a Stein.  Micro head with excellent retention pancakes and recedes leaving trailing lace. Bread, roasted caramel and toast aromas. Smooth with upfront caramel and nuts turning dry in the lasting bitter finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
2195,"2012-08-27",3.1,"meh, a bad bit too grainy and macro tasting. Its pretty close to exactly what the style is, what I love about Jacks Abby is there creativeness with lagers and his is just a copout","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
2195,"2012-08-19",3.2,"Bottle. Pours copper as expected. Maltier than most of the other Jacks I have tasted but not overly so with enough hops to balance it out.",", Massachusetts, USA","BroSpud"
2195,"2012-08-13",3.4,"Bottle. Pours a dark copper color with a foamy white head. Nose is sweet like caramel and honey with a lightly nutty hint.
