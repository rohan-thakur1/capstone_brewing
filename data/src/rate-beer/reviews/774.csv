Palate: light body, very light, creamy, average carbonation.

En apariencia propone una cabeza copiosa de tono cristalino, con burbuja compacta y magnifica retención no se puede llegar a apreciar bien la actividad de carbonatación por la basta turbiedad que tiene acompañada de un color marrón medio y destellos cobrizos, un cuerpo ligeramente medio. En roma es bastante dominante la malta de trigo, con ligeros toques a pan tostados, mucho olor a platano característico de la levadura fenolica y especiada a clavo y algo de acidez, no tiene carácter marcado de los lúpulos. Las impresiones que detecto en el paladar son inicialmente a platano, toques moderados de la malta tostada, cereales, nota dulce y especiada a clavo y algo de coriandro con cierto dejo de acidez que no es agresivo al paladar y si distintivo de la molienda mayoritariamente de trigo que caracteriza los estilos bávaros, una gran cerveza que aun siendo una macro permanece con recetas tradicionales y bien cuidadas que proponen sabores diferentes a las típicas lager.","MEXICO","Yased"

774,"2014-12-03",3.6,"I think this is my first dunkelweizen rating, and it's an interesting introduction to the style. Truly seems like a cross between a hefeweiss and a dark lager/ dunkel bock. Pours a brass/brown color, cloudy with a solid white head. Smells strong of clove, wheat, and toasty caramel. Taste is pleasant and good for the style I suppose, features a standard banana and clove yeasty flavor, along with subtle fruity wheat, and then a finish of caramel maltiness. While enjoyable, I just don't think this combination of hefe/wheaty flavors pairs well with a more earthy maltiness, makes for an odd brew in my opinion. Still this was a pleasant and refreshing beer, finishes clean and has a smooth palate. This may be a strange analogy, but it tastes like a banana dipped in caramel sauce on a slice of bread... though I've never tried such a combination, haha.","South Carolina, USA","eRock_2013"

774,"2014-08-27",3.6,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2016 Classic, standard Bavarian Dunkelweizen, had this many years ago but now re-rating from a bottle of a few months old.  Shows the expected frothy, rocky, dense, foamy, pale beige-tinted head (the colour of which reveals the use of dark malts, of course) and a beautiful deep coppery mahogany colour, lightly haze, while a steady stream of powerful fizz rises up from the bottom of the glass - a pretty sight, as usual with these beers, when poured in a Weissbier vase...  Aroma of fudge, banana cake, gingerbread, soapy wheat, tea leaves, dried orange peel, apricot, freshly baked brown bread, some undisturbingly natural iron, subtler hints of cocoa powder, hazelnut paste, fresh grass, cloves, vague sweaty grain accent.  Fruity onset with classic sweet and sour balance, the expected banana of course but paired well with hints of red apple, peach and sweet berries; carbo is on the soft side for the style, emphasizing a fluffy, soft, lovely smooth mouthfeel.  Bready, lightly biscuity and notably caramelly barley prevails in the middle, but a soapy, gently sourish wheat presence comes from underneath and refreshes the finish, which is further adorned with retronasal dried fruit esters and subtle but unmistakable clove-like phenols, as well as a faraway, earthy, very faintly spicy but otherwise totally soft hop presence lending only the thinnest and briefest, but structurally important glimpse of bitterness.  Juicy caramelly malt sweetness and soapy wheats linger on after swallowing.  Friendly, gentle, fluffy, juicy: this is everything a decent, traditional Dunkelweizen has to be, nothing more, nothing less.  Classic in every sense of the word and seen the relative ease with which this can be obtained, an ideal acquaintance with the style.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

774,"2007-03-13",3.0,"Vom fass @ Frankfurt International Airport, Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany (July 2006).
Last Mercedes Benz E class taxi my wife and I would take, or see, and the last beer I would try before leaving sehr schön Deutschland for home. It came in its own tall glass, enthralled with charging effervescence, a tawny, opaque, caramel coloured elixir toppled on by a very excited, ever expanding head of fluff that did its best to escape. Conversation beyond the beer turned to a lovely lass from Sydney about to head to Lebanon to see her family. The beer now background, it smelt of soggy chocolate biscuits entwined with cloves, used band-aids and fresh, ripe bananas. Prickly, from the bubbles, it pierced the nostrils last thought. Tasted of carbonic acid, too fizzy chilled and fresh, some conversation later it got better. A little doughy, cookie dough and tangy wheat, a lemony sour, tangy backdrop as it hurtles down the sides, the subtle, clappy swallow has the ripe banana, subtle bubblegum mix of a good hefe-weiss with a flowing biscuity swallow that lasts and works. It holds just a light edge of woody reserve to make each mouthful after the first a little better, a little more enticing. Lost in converse I must say that I fell away while tasting this which made it more pleasurable. A sessionable, simple Dunkel weiss that ranked up with pub greats. Good with the mind off!!!","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Pours a very cloudy dark brown with some hints of amber. The head is two fingers tall, and fades slowly to a to thick cap, leaving behind a solid sheet of foam in the glass.

Smell; this has a solid wheat aroma, with a little clove and bananas. Theres a very nice caramel malt presence as well. Pretty much what I would expect in a Dunkel Weizen, but not really outstanding.

Taste; bananas and cloves are present in the flavor along with the wheat and caramel malts. This follows the aroma, but with a hint of bubblegum, and the other flavors are a bit more pronounced than the aroma was.

But I must admit that I do generally find German dark beers a touch uninspiring. I think I expect the darker colour to contribute a fuller body and greater depth of flavour than their paler equivalents, but often the difference is marginal. In fact its not very dark, but an attractive coppery colour with a lasting white head. The aroma is wheaty (not surprisingly) with more lemon than banana and I thought I picked up a slightly smoky edge. Lemon carries through on to the palate. Quite sharp with a tinny edge.
