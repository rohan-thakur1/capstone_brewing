3809,"2015-11-15",4.1,"Location: 750 ml bottle from the brewery, 11/15/15, Rating #5000! Wow, thats a lot of ticks. Seemed only fitting to consume this one the way so many of the previous were: sitting around on a Sunday watching football.


Aroma: The aroma is funky and fruity, some pepper/spice, floral, and honey notes

Appearance: It pours a clear golden color with a sheeting white head and coating lace

Flavor: Tastes funky, tart, and a little sweet. The yeasty spice component comes through on the close. Theres kind of a bright floral / honey component that doesnt necessarily change the underlying flavor but adds a nice complimentary piece to the overall flavor of this beer.

Palate: This beer feels quite bright and refreshing on the mouth, with an average to lively carbonation, and a lasting, somewhat dry finish. Extremely drinkable at 6.5%.

Overall Impression: 
Another excellent Hill Farmstead beer. Everything is just really well put together here. Its not a mind blowing beer, instead, its a work of fine craftsmanship. One of those beers that proves how sometimes simplicity is the best path to brilliance, which is one of those things thats true in most of the culinary arts, but something we take for granted too often.

This review is really about that rating number though. 5000 ratings in the 8ish years Ive been rating (and the almost 7 Ive been active in the site - sadly, I have to admit I originally learned of the site and began tracking my ratings through the RateBeer Facebook app that existed for a while back in 08) feels crazy to me.  I feel like Im a pretty active rater, but Ill never get close to that multiple thousand per year level that others manage to achieve. Anyway, very excited to hit this level. Thanks to RateBeer for turning this from a hobby into something more. Glad to have used this site to reconnect with old friends, turn others into beer obsessives, and make new ones. Thanks to everyone Ive shared one of those 5k with, its been a pleasure, and Im looking forward to the next 5k.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

3809,"2015-09-11",4.0,"From notes. Found a lost page from a tasting with Eric and Haley on April 24! Poured from a 750 mL bottle. The pour is a golden yellow color with a large, fizzy white head and some good legs of lace. The aroma is surprisingly good. There is a lot of lemongrass with this one. A good grassy note balances with the citrus and a pretty strong wheat. The wheat isnt traditionally Belgian, which is what I was expecting from a saison. The flavors are a little sweeter than I would predict. There is a nice honey presence to accompany the citrus and a good spiciness brings up the rear. Its definitely a style I think I need to try to get used to. The mouth feel is thin, crisp, and carries a large carbonation with it. The aftertaste is grassy, wheaty, and offers a little spice with it on the finish. Not too bad.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3809,"2015-08-31",4.4,"750 mL bottle poured into a taster. No bottle date.
 Light golden body with an enormous head. The bottle was a bit of a gusher, so Im not so surprised. Excellent lacing.
Strong yeast. Light acidity. Honey. Pale malts and some spice. Bready.

Lemon tartness right up front. Then lightly sweet bready malts. Pale malts less prominent in comparison to the bread flavors. A touch of honey. Less intense spice aspect, but still really yeasty.
Medium-heavy body with medium carbonation, despite the gushing. Good and easy drinking.

Dont remember the date, but I assume its around one year, give or take a few months.Perfect hazy sunset colored body has a perfectly well-retained white head atop.Not-quite-sulfur ""stinkiness"" in the nose is delightful and quickly joined by floral notes and very light white and black pepper phenols. Not as acidic as Arthur in either aroma or flavor, though perhaps not quite the depth and power of Arthur in the aroma. No alcohol noted, nor flaw.Playful acids are gentle and joined by just a touch of orange blossom-like honey notes. Honey is fully fermented and sits in the background, adding just a touch of stickiness, and its trademark fermentation characteristics of pepper and vanilla. Incredibly soft, gentle texture leads to very light lactic character on the end. Notes of ripe pluots and other dry stone fruits keep things incredibly bright.

3809,"2015-07-26",4.6,"Bottle dated ""2015 05 14""
This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a hazy burnt golden yellow to orange color with slim fingers worth of foamy white head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds leaving some light rings of lacing.
The smell starts off with an eloquent sweet floral setting leading into a smooth sweet honey and a light underscore of spice to balance. Light citrus also makes a light presence.
The taste was mainly sweet through the floral and the honey adding a bit of grassiness underneath. Theres no aftertaste but a light sweet floral finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly smooth. Light sweet floral tones hit my tongue in a refreshing manner.

3809,"2015-04-13",4.4,"Many thanks to Ron for providing the bottle.

Sunny yellow color, with a decent, bubbly, white head.

Smells of funky yeast, crisp citrus and floral, matured hops. Tartness is well pronounced, entangled in straw and honey, acting as an interesting counterpart to the acidic lime.

Has a pleasant, fitting, lively carbonation with a versatile, decent body.

Tastes of lemon peel, hay, floral, slightly herbacious hops, exhibiting a pleasant bitter note among spritzy, refreshing tartness. The beer got a great complexity to it, revealing a honeyed note, juicy lemon and green apple peel, blending incredibly well into the sour, well balanced base of the brew. Finishes with a pleasant dryness among wheat, soft yeast and a sour tartness, balanced by slightly biscuity malts.

Again, I am truly surprised by Hill Farmstead, creating a beer full of many different layers of flavor on top of its tart, refreshing foundation. Honey is present on its own, highlighting the citrus and floral hops, without overpowering the beers acidic character. Very refreshing, sessionable, with an enjoyable complexity to it, convincing by its balance.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3809,"2014-12-21",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 29, 2016 Thanks to Ryan for sharing this at my place a few months back. From notes. Appearance: Hazy straw-gold, frothy white head, good lacing. Aroma: lemon, mineral, pepper; armpit. Taste: lightly sweet honey, otherwise slightly tart, slightly funky, dry mineral finish. Palate: Medium- body (a little thin); slick texture. Long pear juice lingers with lightly bitter finish. Overall: continuing the theme of ""solid, nice saisons that dont change my world the way the Vermont deity is supposed to."" Good, better than most, but doesnt approach the best Ive had from say, Fantome (though heads and shoulders above the worst Fantomes, too, so obviously not a good comparison). Still, quite good.   bottle again tonight. Nothing that I disavow in the last rating, but it gels more this time. These beers do better in isolation, in my opinion. Bumping from 3.8 to 3.9 (could be 4.0+, but will need more samples).","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

3809,"2014-11-29",4.1,"2013 bottle. It's a nice, hazy golden straw color with a small white head. Aroma is earthy and slightly musty with some lemon. The taste has a little tartness at the front that goes into the earthy, barnyard funk. I get lemon and lime towards the end with a hint of bitterness that is barely noticeable. Ends with a pleasant, cheesy taste that settles into the tongue. Detected a bit of sweetness but couldn't say it was honey. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and dry. Wonderful saison.

Pours a light crisp yellow hidden beneath a persistent finger of white billowy foam. Brilliant clarity. The ale yeast dominates the nose with hints of apples and coriander. The nose also has some lemon and the slightest honey note. Flavor is crisply saison with a good bittering addition of hops and some sweetness from the yeast it seems like. There is an industrial flavor on the beer I cant quite place, not unpleasant. Good long musty finish. The beer is thin with high and lively carb with a watery finish. Good stuff.

Some really intriguing and complex stuff going on here, although I found the copper/metallic note to be unwelcome. The flavor is highly lemony and acidic as it strikes the tongue but smoothes out as the beer moves across the palate. There it reveals a nuanced honey sweetness with floral accents, Meyer lemon and key lime tartness, and a bretty finish with a honeycomb note and a tinge of sour and bitter.

3809,"2013-02-05",3.6,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip.  From notes.

Anna has a cloudy, bright golden color with a huge white head.  As I expect from a well-made saison, the cap fades to a more modest size while leaving sticky sheets of lace down the side of my glass.

The aroma is sticky sweet, with notes of pale malt, honey, and crackers.  There are pear and lemon zest esters as well, adding a subtle depth of character to the smell.

Each sip is smooth, starting out with a dry maltiness that I expect out of a saison.  The notes of pear, honey, lemon zest, and general spice weave into each other, creating a nice balance between the light malts, sweetness, and tinge of tartness.  Some more herbal notes come in toward the end of the sip, and the last flavor on my tongue is the spicy yeast.

There is quite a dry mouthfeel throughout, with vibrant and energetic carbonation helping to aid with the lightness of the feel and the aromatics.  Crisp.

After a certain point I should just get the message that this is not my style and stop reviewing saisons.  Clearly this is a well made beer, but I did not really connect with it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
3809,"2013-02-01",3.7,"750, capped, at Mikkeller. To say this beer is highly carbonated would be to grossly underestimate the ambitions of the carbon dioxide therein. Popping the cap was a big fat jailbreak for this beer. All three bartenders got at least a little tiny bit splashed. Shot everywhere. Big white geyser. Striking. Hazy medium gold in the glass, fluffy eggy head settles quickly to not much, as expected, and the carb was a little on the light side, as expected--too much was lost. Not to the great detriment of the beer by any means, but softened and mellowed it a little overmuch. Big honey nose, showing a little bit of minty herbaceousness and caramel as well, along with some sweet floral notes. That yeast and that honey sugar been makin bebbehs in the bottleses.

A touch of honey. Mildly sweet with a healthy floral presence throughout. Every aspect of the beer is so delicate and balanced. Just beautiful. Bready malts with hints of spice. Pronounced floral bitterness. Finishes dry.

4.5 A: Moderately hazed golden yellow color. The bottle gushed a bit on me and I needed two pours to get a full glass. The second pour left almost three fingers of pillowy white head. Retention is very good and tons of lacing is left.

3.5 S: Super dry and super herbal. Thistle, grass, dry hay. Pear leads the fruit party with lemon zest and bitter orange peel. Just the slightest honey component. Some yeasty breadiness.

3.5 T: Quite lemony. Way more than the nose suggested. Tart lemon juice foremost, but also lemon zest - basically lemon merangue pie. Again a big herbal component with the flavors listed in the nose and additionally hints of mint, chard, and parsley. Surprisingly bitter and perhaps a bit too much so. Again the honey is a bit underwhelming, but still a good add. Pear frutiness underneath. 

3.5 M: Lighter body. Good moderate carbonation despite the minor gushing. I like spritzy carbonation in saisons and this only has a touch of that. Still, smooth and decent enough. 

3.5 D: I looked at some reviews after making mine and I must say that either this bottle is different from what others have been drinking or they are imagining smells and flavors. That said, its a good beer, but Id take a HF IPA or porter over this anyday.

3809,"2012-10-10",3.9,"Dirty blonde and clear.  The tartness of the wheat in this aroma carries a fiery sensation.  Coriander, clove, lemon, and salt.  Inhaling deeply of all this spice is searingly brisk.  Floral qualities glimmer lightly underneath for some balance, in some earthy hops and the honey presence.

Taut, snappy honey sweetness coupled with the sharpness of the wheat makes for a winningly simple flavor; dusted over with the intricacies of its yeast, it gets more detailed - herbal and weird - as it warms.  Honeyed apples, cinnamon, and banana, together with the beginnings of a pleasant basement mustiness.

Crisp, light to medium palate.  Finishes with a drawn out very tart wheat flavor and lingers; Id like to sit it for a bit, but its put together beautifully and I do believe Ive stated that sentiment verbatim regarding a HF saison in the past.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

I got a very small taste of this at the last Hunahpu release (thanks to whoever that was) so I knew it would be good but man is this beer special.  It pours a golden color with a big lasting fluffy white head that leaves some substantial lacing.  A wonderful array of scents invade the aroma consisting of citrus peel, grass, leafy hops, spring flowers, soft herbal notes, and raw honey.  Wow.  The flavors are so incredibly well integrated.  Theres a crackery-honey sweetness to this but its super dry in teh finish with a touch of fresh citrus bitterness.

3809,"2012-05-12",3.9,"750 mL bottle. Batch 2. Poured into a tulip.

Pours a chilled golden lemon color with a frothy white head. Thick clumps of lacing and never ending retention. Smells like a slightly sweet, funky barnyard. Dominated by pepper, clove, and lemongrass and backed up by a surprising punch of candy like honey. Medium bodied, soft and delicate on the palate, but doesnt finish as crisp or dry as expected for the style. Flavor is very similar to the other non-BA HF saisons and has a traditional earthy, musty and funky finish. Strong grass, biscuit malt and earthy flavors complement a surprisingly noticeable amount of honey. Another solid saison from HF, with a subtle, enjoyable twist.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","yourefragile"

3809,"2012-04-20",3.7,"On tap at the brewery in Greensboro, VT. Pours a cloudy, yellow-orange colored body with an inch thick, dense and frothy, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is a nice mix of spicy hops and lightly sweetened malts. Some pale cereal malts with a touch of honey sweetness, grass, hay, grapefruit citrus, florals, pepper, and a bit of a lemon zest. Flavor is similar. Smooth cereal pale malts up front with a light honey sweetness. Zesty grapefruit citruses with a touch of lemon, some white pepper, hay, grass, and soft florals. This finishes dry and a bit spicy and grassy, but the cereal malts keep it smooth and add a touch of honey sweetness. Light bitterness following a very smooth and soft, medium-light body and a gentle, moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty solid saison. I wasnt as impressed with this as some of the other raters, but it was still fairly complex and well done. Good beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
3809,"2012-04-12",4.6,"750 ml bottle. A lightly hazy medium blonde beer, with a huge, fizzy, frothy, lacing almost fully lasting white head. The aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted bread), lightly to moderately hoppy (flowers, herbs, lemon), lightly to moderately yeasty (earth, dough), with notes of honey, exotic fruits, pepper, spicy/perfumey herbs/flowers (hardly definable, but like lavender/basil/dandelion), oranges. The flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, dry and very long finish with moderate bitterness. This is a hell of a beer... Noble and American hops are amazingly integrated, live everything in this stuff, including the honey presence, subtle but effective. Marvellous from the beginning to the end, a true showstopper and shared with my mother Anna. I m hugely impressed by Hill Farmstead and I definately need more.","Firenze, ITALY","Slayer85"

The nose is full of lemon, grain, green apples, hay, oranges, mild coriander,  light funk and just a hint of sweet honey.  Reminds me a bit of the beautiful nose of cuvee de castleton.  Taste follows suit with a nice grainy base complemented by a blend of mellow, fresh fruits (lemon, apples, oranges, grapes).  Mouthfeel is very nice with a light to medium body, assertive carbonation keeps things moving, crisp refreshing finish.

3809,"2012-03-31",4.4,"750ml bottle, enjoyed by my lonesome on the balcony overlooking Sunny Isles Beach with a delicious prosciutto/chorizo/pecorino sandwich on hours-fresh sourdough. This is the life.The body is a slightly hazy, gorgeous golden shade that shines brightly in the sun, revealing continuous streams of champagne-like bubbles. The effervescence feeds a creamy, steadfast blanket of tight-bubbled, snow-white foam. Short, fat, curled flares of lace harken to the profile shot of a chunky ocean wave. Beautiful beer.The aroma on this beauty suggests of the very sourdough bread that I enjoy along side it.  Fresh, lightly malted cereal grain and softly sweet dough provide a subdued backdrop, while masterfully subtle, peppery wildflower notes and aged, grassy hops come across dry, dusty, and mouthwatering. Honey is nearly fully attenuated, and was clearly used with (welcomed) restraint. The yeast is distinct, offering a soft pungency that I enjoy.Flavors largely follow the nose. Fresh, bready grains are kissed with the softest possible glaze of honey. I get a distinct hint of flaked oats, and maybe some hay. Zippy, dusty, peppery spice nods to marigold, dandelion, and other such dry, fragrant wildflowers. Hops are again grassy, providing the perfect amount of bitterness.  So tasty.The palate approaches perfection. The moderately substantive body has been attenuated to the point where I dont think an additional micron of alcohol could be squeezed out of this thing. Dry as a bone, this beaut is laced with intense, lively carbonation that intensifies the wildflower spiciness before cleaning the palate off entirely. Even after the swallow, I can still feel tiny bubbles tickling the roof of my mouth.If I close my eyes, thoughts of Saison Dupont rush in...only this is better. Yes, I realize that is a bold statement. Its spicier (without going overboard), drier, more flavorful, and perhaps most importantly, more ambitious without getting carried away. Excellent beer from arguably the best saison brewer in the country at the moment.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Very crisp and drinakble. Only a little bit tart in finish. Excellent. Re tried a few times, beautiful tropical funk and salty earth with some belgian tones. Another great brew from HF. A top notch staple in all regards.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"

The taste is similar but rather than the smoothness noted in the nose the fairly high degree of carbonation creates a sort of prickly punctuated array of flavors mostly consisting of various saison like yeasty spices as well as a mix of slight tartness and a sense of apple and pear like fruitiness.

3809,"2012-02-04",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 13, 2012 Purchased at Hunger Mountain Co-Op in Montpelier, VT in early December. Its the first HFS beer Ive picked up and the first that Ive opened. Poured at 45 Degrees F into a red wine glass.

A - Soft and really beautiful pour. The head was larger than I thought at about 3 fingers with ultra tiny, almost creamy bubbles. The beer itself is golden with a nice haze and tons of bottom to top bubbles.

S - Tons of delicious farm style / light belgian yeast is what I get first of all. TONS of vermont honey which I have daily at breakfast so I know what Im talking about. Mild banana and some cheese aspects.

T - Its a pretty bready beer with only mild honey notes. Its a very dry beer...maybe champagne yeast? I dont really know but it smelled far better than it tasted.

M - Tons of carbonation, light bodied and very easy to drink. The lingering yeast taste is over the top for me.

O - Its a very tasty beer but its a bit more funky and more bready than I wished. I wouldnt buy it again but HFS is local to me so Ill probably try more of their beers soon.


UPDATE: I had a 2010 Anna on Tap last night. Huge difference and showed me what this beer does over time. The carbonation mellows, the beer becomes smoother and honey is far more pronounced.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

3809,"2011-03-19",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2011 750ml bottle opened on March 19, 2011.

Pours a bright and clear icterine, with a massive three finger head. Exceptional clarity on the first pour.

The nose bursts with bright floral attributes, accompanied by sweet honey, orange, and tangerine. Hay-like sweet grains and very light, barely dirty barn notes.

Where the nose is illuminated, the taste is soft and finessed. Honey and floral on the front of the tongue, with a nice citrus and grapefruit component mid-palate, that carries on through the dried-out finish. The early-to-mid palate is like a spring day: warm, with a clean cereal grain anonymity. A combination of sugar sweetness and mineral bitterness, like that in the coating of baby aspirin, shows in the finish, though it doesnt distract too much. Theres some lingering grassy/herbal bitterness on the finish.

Just under medium carbonation, Anna is very full and creamy. The finish is appropriately dry and the final concoction of lemon, grass, and herb lingers in the throat.

Quite enjoyable. One of the two best saisons Ive had in recent memory; this one is just so bright in the nose and raw, yet strangely finessed, in the mouth. I wish it popped as much in the taste as in the nose, but its hard to argue with qua bière de miel.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

3809,"2011-02-17",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2017 My Bottom Line:
Herbal, spicy hops surf this Saisons citrusy waves, while lightly honeyed cereals and haystacks effortlessly leave way for a bitter, wooden undertow and increasing dryness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-Towering foam attains perfect retention and lacing atop the hazy blond.
-Natural carbonation is fluffy and amazingly soft.
-The finish is the meeting of herbal hops and doughy yeast.
-White grapefruit and citrusy thyme allusions are found throughout.
-The wildflower honey character is more prominent than the flavor profile. It is intelligently integrated.
-At this point, I get the impression that any Saison from Hill Farmstead will be a masterpiece. I dont think I can decide on a favorite since theyre all so complex, authentic and amazingly drinkable.
-Addendum: an 18-month old bottle was absolutely mindblowing. Pretty much perfect, as a matter of fact. Tartness had slowly developed, fitting in perfectly with the rest of the complex and comfortable flavor profile. Wow.
