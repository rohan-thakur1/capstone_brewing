977,"2015-09-11",3.7,"Draught at Deep Ellum, 9/4/15.White gold, ultra-pale body topped by a small but dense white head that slowly recedes to cover. Moderate haziness.Very tart, floral/perfumey brett notes in the nose (suprise) are wedded pretty nicely with light tropical fruits (dry pineapple, guava) and hints of pear, orangeskin and heavy lemon balm/lemon oil. Malts seem cracker-like, and quite free from any doughiness, really preserving the levity/headiness of the nose. No alcohol or flaws.Where the fatale blanc was bogged down by the oily, overly dominant wine barrel and lower, looser carbonation, this version really shines with clear lime/pear/lemon brett notes and a dry grain character adding cracker/biscuit notes and light malt adding light honey to match the acidity of the finish. Hops complement/augment the brett notes, for a change, instead of detracting/distracting and theres no oak tannin or resin or heavy breadiness. Good stuff. Maybe just a touch too much perfumey/floral dryness exacerbating the dry, crackery malts, but it certainly is light and drinkable.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Incredible aromas with big bright citrus/tropical hop and brett ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pear, floral, grass, pepper, light pine, bread, light funk, and floral/grassy earthiness.

Damn nice complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops and spicy/fruity brett flavors; with a great hop/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky/prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish.

Loads of bright citric hops and a good deal of funky yeast character. Its all tangerine rinds and farmhouse. Some honeysuckle in there, as well. Taste starts sweet with more bright, fresh citrus but quickly dries out and gives a little bitter bite. If the beer were sweeter, Im not sure that there would be enough bitterness for me, but as is, its just incredibly refreshing. Sort of a funky twang in the finish. Feel is light and airy with some hop oiliness. This is very much a brett IPA. Its big on fresh, bright citrus, brett funk and dry very light malt. Great for a hot day.

977,"2013-06-04",2.8,"Poured into an ISO Tasting glass from a bottle.

Smell: Slight citrus/pine, hop aroma is underwhelming. Barnyard and cheesy umami smells from the brett are overwhelming. Slightly musty. Has ""complexity"" but is overall strange and underwhelming.

Appearance: Super opaque and hazy, 4ish SRM, white head has a moderate retention. Pretty poor lacing.

Taste: Black pepper spice, the brett barnyard/umami funk from the nose is highly present. Hop presence is pretty underwhelming and leaves me to say this doesnt belong in the IPA category. Aftertaste reminds me of eating a sharp, old, funky hard cheese.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body, medium-low carbonation. Astringent and cheesy lingering mouthfeel.

Overall: Entirely disappointed by this beer. Came highly recommended but lacks any idea of subtlety or complexity. 100% brett can probably be done well, but this is not that beer. Comes across as eating a strong sharp cheddar, which seems cool and novel at first, but becomes cloying before finishing your first glass.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Brewfessor"

977,"2012-12-23",3.1,"22 oz. bottle, pours a clear golden with a small white head. Nose blends characteristics of both an IPA and a brett bomb, with the brettanomyces immediately apparent, along with some piney hops, biscuity malts and some slight tangy funk from the brett. Flavour is similar, with the light-to-moderately funky brett upfront, burying the hops a bit though there is feint reminiscent of piney hops and biscuity malt underneath. The more I drink, the more I get prominent cat pee qualities as well, probably from the citra. Light-bodied and very drinkable. Decent stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

Head retention and lacing are both good.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells mostly like citrusy hops (grapefruit, pineapple), along with some brett, floral hops and bready malt.  Taste is mostly like the aroma, but I think the brett comes out stronger in the taste.  Theres some citrusy and floral hop flavors noticeable, and bready malt is in there too.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its slick with moderate carbonation.  I liked this brew, I might have to pick up another bottle in the future.  $8.99 a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
