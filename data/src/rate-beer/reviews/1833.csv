1833,"2013-05-01",3.4,"Bottle: Poured a deep brown/black color porter with a medium size dark brown foamy had with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of chocolate with light raisins notes and some residual sugar. Taste is dominated by some residual sugar with some chocolate notes and some dry raisins. Body is quite full with good carbonation and light warming alcohol notes.  Overall taste is quite intense and this ends up being a real sipper which I think could be addressed by bring additional attenuation to increase the drinkability factor.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
1833,"2013-02-02",3.7,"22 oz. bottle, sent from StFun (thanks Josh), pours black with a small tan head. Aroma is a bit oxidized but not too bad, with some fruitiness, cardboard, and chocolate. Flavour brings out notes of raisins and milk chocolate dominantly, with a bit of wet cardboard and a hint of roast. Finishes on notes of milk chocolate and light roast. Though not in prime condition, this has actually aged quite well. Very enjoyable baltic porter.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1833,"2013-01-30",3.3,"650 mL bottle courtesy of StFuncool, thanks! I wish I had adamantium claws to deal with all the electrical tape wrapped tightly around the cap these days. But, anyway, it pours a a vinegary, wooded darkish brown sustaining a frothy tanned ring which rested atop. Aromas of leather, banana peppers, raisins, aniseed, toast crumbs, milk chocolate... cardboard? Chestnuts? Yeah, okay. Perhaps some bourbon as well? Tastes of nuts, caramel, yeast, with a touch of heat, ash and toast by mid-palate to swallow. Incredibly reminiscent of a Scotch ale, albeit one whose flavors are a little on the imbalanced-side. Still deciding whether or not I actually like this beer.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"

Thick dark black pour, ring of light brown carbonation and an awesome aroma of rich black cherries, plums and slightly sweet dark chocolate.  Flavor is just as good as the aroma, black cherry skins, some sweet alcoholic raisins, plums, a little soy/peat and finished with some bitter chocolate.

Poured into my Minneapolis Town Hall glass, showing really nice chocolate brown colour with an opaque core. Medium-thick pale tan head is short lived, with ropey lacing. Nose is tart berries, cocoa powder, wood, and dense fruit, with a whiff of smoke as well. Flavours of tart berries, Tootsie pops, cocoa, very tart, moderate to light carbonation. Good, but not great.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","Savvy1982"
1833,"2012-04-13",3.6,"Bottle.  A little all over the place with a wide range of flavors.  It seems like it cant make up its mind between being fantastic and outright offensive.  Somewhere in the middle though there are lots of flavors including chocolate, caramel, smoke, tar, roasted malts, and a large amount of dark fruit.  Despite its brief downfalls, such as a weird carrot juice thing, it remains to be a pretty good baltic porter.  However, it will have a hard time competing against others in its class such as Smuttynose Baltic Porter.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Bigmmartin"

How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed approximately when 6 months of age.  Bottle sent to me by FullObs, thanks a lot Brett 
The look: Near-black body with red highlights topped by a medium tan head
In long: Nose smells rich with cocoa beans, Fig Newton, milk chocolate and more.  Taste is surprising by its drinkability.  Some roast A lot of desert-like flavors (date squares, Fig Newton, milk chocolate, nougat, mocha coffee) but also a good amount of leafy spicy that provide a good balance.

Its like opening up a box of fresh assorted chocolates.  A toasty nutty scent with dark fruit follows.  This drinks very smooth and creamy with some ashy notes in the finish.  Getting plenty of the chocolate here too but its maybe not quite as strong as the aroma.  Graham cracker, prune, and a dash of a coffee liquor note gives this some depth.  Slightly roasty but its far more on the creamy side.  This is really solid stuff.  Love the drinkability, wish I had more.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

A lot of the smokiness comes through on the nose with a woody, chocolate backbone, but not so much smoke in the taste.  The smoke is definitely more along the lines of subtle peat, and not necessarily campfire.  Sweet chocolate dominates the palate along with coffee, dried prunes, and roasted malt.

A light tan head only raises to leave a thing ring. Poor lacing... The aroma is very sweet, tons of milk chocolate, little too sweet for me. A little roasted grain too, smells like a porter, but a little simple... Taste packs much more of a punch. More smoke and bitter coffee notes, gets ride of the sweetness, Im a fan of that. Chocolate pokes its head out on the finish but so does a touch of alcohol. The front is successful but then a little down hill... The mouthfeel is nice, very full and chewy for a porter.

650ml bottle.

It pours a thick dark brownish black with a foamy light tan head. It leaves some decent lacing as it recedes.

The smell is interesting, it smells like an equal parts mix of plain Perrier, Czech pilsener, and coffee. Weird.

The flavor is the same way oddly enough, a bit roastier though. It has this mineral water quality to it that I dont mind but it just seems odd. It gets better with progressive drinks, and it also gets sweeter.

A bit of an oddity, it is a decent porter.

Smell: Surprisingly simple nose smelling lightly of roasted barley, unsweetened chocolate, licorice, and, well, thats about it.

Taste: Roasted barley with sweetish, somewhat diluted tastes of basic chocolate, caramel, and licorice. Low earthy, roasty bitterness. Darkened grains and hints of dark fruits. Roast and a warming alcohol presence on the otherwise light, clean finish. A ""killer"" it is not.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation.

Drinkability: The tastes within were subtler and far more understated than Id prefer. Also, the body seemed a bit on the lean side. While Im happy to have gotten the chance to try this, it just didnt win me over.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Pours a dark brown, molasses-caramel-colored, with a fringe edging sienna-orange and rim in dark khaki. Flavor is even more subtle than I expect. Somehow, a very traditional eastern European character develops first with cool lager crispness, then the pils character, before a more subtle and subdued roast and char. The slightly lower viscosity and the slightly higher carbonation makes this drinkable, but dont quite give it the dense punch that I would expect from something like Koff. Still, fresh, flavorful, balanced, relatively dry, and the alcohol is very well integrate. A nice example. Nothing crazy. Thanks Steve!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

There a big sweetness right from the outset in the nose with lots of dark malts and semi-sweet chocolate.  There are hints of both dark fruits, raisins maybe, and espresso.

The taste is just as sweet with lots of chocolate and caramel hitting up front with the underlying malt base being slightly toasted.  There is a bit of bitterness in the finish, mostly from the chocolate and a hint of alcohol burn.

The body is on the fuller side of things with a soft carbonation and fairly dry finish.

there is a defined ashiness and light sourness hanging around the palate...both are a nice balance to a rich mix of creamy chocolate, barley earthiness, cooked dried figs, wood, molasses and just a touch of sweetness. that tartness comes in to clean off the palate so  a chocolate bomb and toasted nuttiness can linger on the aftertaste.

Theres a healthy dose of earthy hops, along with some roasted chicory, all of which works really well together.  Flavors are melded beautifully, raw, woodsy, bittersweet cacao and dark caramel fighting for supremacy, with roasted coffee and dark fruits serving as backup.  Some lactose comes through in the form of mocha, while peppery, earthy hops finish things off.  Bitter spices linger on the finish.

Flossmoor Stations new Creation is a baltic porter named Killer Kowalski. Pours the darkest of brown, bordering on black, with faint mahogany stained highlights along the edges only when held directly to the light. A 1 finger super creamy brown head formed on the pour that stayed put for a few minutes before falling to a whispy head thats thick around the edges. Leaves spotty lacing.

The smell is powerful and warming. Deeply roasted malts mingle with coffee grounds and under-ripe banana. Dark fruits abound including fig and plum with a solid dose of boozy sweetness. Complex.

Taste is identical to the aroma. There are no rough edges at all. Every flavor meshes perfectly with the next. Finishes with a sweetened boozy hit with mild fumes in the throat. Very enjoyable and warming.

The body is rich and luxurious. Creamy and velvety with a medium body that goes down smooth. This beer actually soothes the tongue with the mouthfeel.

This is an extremely drinkable Baltic Porter. I could sip this all night long. Until the 8.3% caught up to me anyway.

Flossmoor Station always manages to impress me whether its their special releases like this or their old standbys. This is an extremely well made Baltic porter that isnt over-sweetened and sticky like so many others. They built this beer just right. Another great job.

1833,"2007-03-28",4.4,"22oz handbottled by Duane!  - Thanks a bunch! - Pours black as night with a healthy tan head that fades back to a ring but leaves scant lace from there.  Aromas of some chocolate, lots of plum, prune and raisin, and some slight liccorice.  Flavor is amazingly complex as well.  Dark bakers chocolate, raisin, prune, roasted malts, slight smoke, caramel, and a little bit of vanilla.  Smooth almost oily palate with slight carbonation.  No sign of the alcohol.. This one is a beaut and is one of the better Baltics Ive tried.. Wow i really like this!!  Thanks Duane for the chance to get to try this one!!!","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"
1833,"2007-03-26",4.3,"Oily black pour, reminiscent of inky octopus attacks, with swirling ruby and chestnut hues that are both very dark and subtle. Thin cream colored head with ample retention. This is a very pretty porter. Aroma is milk chocolate, mellow perfumy yeast, fresh white oak barrels, anise, smoke, berries, light caramel, vanilla, plentiful sweet malt and just a touch of alcohol. Flavor is much the same, with moderate to heavy roastiness as sort of a dessert topping, a syrupy coating. More apparent alcohol and a unique woodiness. Chocolate resembles fresh fudge, like on half cooked brownies. At first the carbonation seems abrasive but keeps this lively. Mouthfeel is slick but full and heavy. Finishes chocolatey and mildly warming. Excellent. A crowning achievement for a top notch brewpub.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
1833,"2007-03-20",3.9,"growler.  pours a dark brown with a light mahogany, rubyish edge and a short-lived tan head.  aroma is sweet malts with some chocolate.  flavor is more sweet malts, dark ripe fruit and some bittersweet chocolate.  mouthfeel is slightly oily with mild carbonation and a slightly acidic finish.  my first beer from Flossmoor and it did not disappoint.","Quad-Cities, Illinois, USA","barleyPops"
1833,"2007-03-20",3.9,"Growler, via Drnk_McDermott.  Pours a burnt caramel brown under a fairly small large bubbled head with minimal retention.  Aroma is licorice, caramel, and chocolate primarily with some roast, light alcohol, and cocoa.  Flavor has lots of caramel and roast up front followed by lots of licorice and alcohol on the finish.  Very clean and lacking in the fruitiness found with most top fermented Baltic Porters.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly oily with light carbonation.  Feels like maybe a little bit of CO2 has been lost which may also account for the less than impressive head formation.  A pretty darn nice beer all the same though.  Seems to really follow in the true tradition of Baltic Porters.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
1833,"2007-03-17",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 18, 2007 Growler... St. Patricks Day 2007... This beer rocks!...  Dark, clear ruby lager with a small, creamy, beige head. Roasted, earthy nose with notes of chocolate, smoked meat and resin. The flavor is more bitter and charred than sweet with bold chocolate and tobacco. I didnt pick up any fruity notes in the nose or flavor. Full-bodied with a whole-milk mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Chocolaty, grassy finish. This is a dangerously easy-drinking Baltic Porter that isnt overdone... for a change. Thanks to boboski for stopping by with this gem!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

My second to last sample, this is the one I was most looking forward to.  Since discovering baltic porters a few months ago it has been nice to seek them out.  Unlike imperial stouts it does not seem that everyone and their mother is trying to outdo each other with new baltic porters.  Then again, I could be wrong so if you happen to know local releases, please feel free to send me a bottle as a bonus in trades.  I know with another hour or two I would have ordered a pint of this one.
Aroma / Appearance - The deep black body is the same color as a country sky without a moon.  Only a trace amount of light was able to escape; for the most part it was pitch black.  Cocoa, coffee, blackberries, lemons, peaches and cherry form a very fun bouquet.  The closest experience is that of a smoke filled bowling alley.
Flavor / Palate - The taste of fresh blackberry pie fills the mouth.  It then morphs into chocolate and roasted expresso.  Smoky Christmas ham unfolds next along with pelmani and coffee.  Bourbon and oats complete the last of the transformation before a dry aftertaste of raspberries washes down the throat.  It is an extremely rich and complex beer that can be savored over time.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1833,"2007-03-07",3.9,"Growler.  Poured a clear dark brown chestnut color with an off-white head.  The aroma was roasty and fruity with some smokey notes.  Roasted malt flavor with some dark fruity notes.  Fairly sweet taste with a dry finish.  Light biterness and peat at the finish.  The finish was also mildly acidic.  Full bodied with a light syrupy mouthfeel.  Warming sensation in the chest.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
1833,"2007-03-01",3.8,"A dark cola color.  Small tan head.  Excellent nose.  Very malty caramel taste.  Quite an alcohol kick.  Slight floral nose.  Nice finish.  Not very strong, but really tasty.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
1833,"2007-02-26",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2007 Rerate, had again last night and it really rock, very estery and complex...dig it more with some age on it. Bumping the aroma and overall score by one point each. GET YA SOME!!! On tap: Pint glass that is nearly opaque with a initial small creamy beige head and very good lace. The aroma has notes of prune and fig esters, toasted and chocolate malting, hint of smoke and earthiness. The taste starts with a molasses like twang and an enter play of ripen fleshy fruits leading towards a smoky and coffee-ish finish. Lasting malty sweetness on the aftertaste. The mouth feel is smooth and somewhat lush, soft carbonation that is moderately warming and relaxing. A darn good brew and beer geek worthy, seek and destroy.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1833,"2007-02-24",4.2,"Draft. Damn black in its pint shaker with a thin tan head, a shade lighter than on a stout. Deep dark roast smell. Taste is of dark roast coffee with a touch of Kahlua and plums. Creamy, smooth and sweet. Alcohol is strong, but not heady. clean lager finish. Matt says this is going into a barrel as are the Social Lubricator and upcomming X-IPA. Cant wait!","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

1833,"2007-02-23",3.6,"Great pour, a dark mahogany body with a big tan head, half fizzy, half big bubbles, that laced in slippery sheets of foam.  The aroma holds roasted malts with a touch of barley and some dark dried fruits.  A surge of chocolate comes out of nowhere in the flavor along with coffee grounds and dark caramel.  The alcohol kicks in near the finish, that being interestingly dry.  Good brew.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

1833,"2007-02-21",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2007 What a beauty...black pour with big brown fluffy head.  The nose is big roasted malts and dried fruits.   The first sip is surprisingly light-bodied on the palate, considering the deep, rich color,   heavy aromas, and big ABV.   The flavors though are  impressively over-the-top...rich roasted (read: burnt) caramel and toffee malts, dried fruits like dates and figs, and chocolate.   The ABV is bold and unapologetic.   This is very, very nicely brewed!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
