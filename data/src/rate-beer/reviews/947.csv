947,"2007-02-06",3.1,"rating from memory, tasted spring 06 on tap at the brewpub, poured golden with white head. slight FFF hop quality but nothing like the usual, very bland and watery. nothing not worthy. im not a fan of this style and this didnt make me question that.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
947,"2006-05-16",3.6,"HAD IT AT BREWERY IN DEC 05 WAS NOT BAD KINDA BLAND BUT STILL HAD A GRASSY HOPPY FINISH ONLY HAD ONCE SO WOULD LIKE TO TRY AGAIN TO GET BETTER FEEL FOR IT","Kissimmee, Florida, USA","railcat1"
947,"2005-12-23",4.2,"This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of medium to large sized mostly lasting white colored bubbles that left behind an unnoted lacing.  The body contained average carbonation, was hazy and dark orange brown in color.  Its aroma contained notes of musty malty hoppy notes.  Its mouth feel is initially tingly with a lingering  tingly palate and a flavor that lasts a long time in the aftertaste.  Its flavor contained a long lasting malty hoppy note and was very tasty. It had a good hop presence and was just plain very good.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
947,"2005-12-08",3.7,"Tap at 3F. Small tan fizzy head that mostly diminished, sparse lacing, hazy, and a light orange hue. Aroma was malty, hoppy and some apple. Flavor was sweet malt, some hoppiness, and somewhat dry. Tingly mouthfeel. Light-medium body. Nice brew!","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
947,"2005-12-04",3.4,"I enjoyed this. Very toasty and grassy with a light body. Easy drinking session beer. Leaves an aftertaste like filberts.. (or ** toes if you so prefer.)","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
947,"2005-11-20",2.6,"copper color, white head.  slight yeasty aroma.  mild flavor. not a particular favorite.","Monee, Illinois, USA","dm9831"
947,"2005-11-15",3.5,"Tap @ brewpub.  Hazy tan-amber body, thin white head.  Mandarin orange, lime and a simple cereal malt backing.  The same orange presence leads to the flavor along with caramelized brown sugar and dry grass.  An easy-drinking, hoppy beer.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
947,"2005-11-14",3.3,"light tan color small bubbled off white head some lace.  sweet light citrus aroma very mild.  Light palate some carb ok coating.  Flavor is a mild hop orangish mixed w/ grass some barly there malt and a touch of grain.. not bad but kidna plain.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
947,"2005-11-06",3.1,"Draft at 3F. A light golden amber with some frothy white head. Nose is some light hops, grass, and malt. Taste is more of the same. Some breadiness. Easy drinking, but forgettable.","Detroit, Michigan, USA","JoshuaB"
947,"2005-11-05",3.4,"A small, soapy head sat atop a red-tinted copper body. Bready, nutty aromas, well-roasted, big in malt character with some dry, cracked corn as well. Flavor was very much like Anchor Steam (the only other California Common Ive tried), all malt with abundant nuttiness and a sour finish. Medium-bodied but slightly sticky.

947,"2005-11-05",3.2,"Draft @ brewery. Pours a light amber, dark gold color with a foamy off white head. Nose is faint, but contains some straw and light sweet malt. Taste is mostly straw and light doughiness, some light bitterness finishes it off.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SuIIy"
947,"2005-10-30",3.6,"Draught at the Brewery: slightly murky orange rust with a tan head.  Lightly toasted grain and cereal aromatics combine nicely with the characteristic 3Fs hops.  Well carbonated and smooth palate.  Orange, citrusy flavours initially, that are wrapped up nicely by soft, gooey malts and sweet caramel.  Extremely drinkable and more of a session beer than most from 3Fs.  Enjoyable.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
947,"2005-10-08",3.1,"On tap at brewery: Clean golden hue with a small head and minimal lace. The aroma has notes of grassy and aromatic hops, bready and pale malt, lemongrass and apple. The taste starts with a crisp twangy and citric character and supported by pale and lightly sweet malt. The finish is moderately bitter, dry and light. The feel is refreshing and crisp. A good session brew.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
947,"2005-10-04",3.3,"Dark brownish color with a hint of dark red.  Thin head that went away quickly.  Aroma is light and easy on the nose.  The beer feels thin in the mouth and goes down easy.  Malts and the typical 3 floyds hops are in the taste.  Sweet and not really bitter at all.  Pretty good, but I wont make it a favorite.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
947,"2005-10-04",3.6,"Murky copper color. May be lighter; perhaps the FFF lights are throwing it off.
Crisp, lager-like hop water. I say water, because of its ""crispness"", and because of its lack of carbonation. Not that that is bad. Its crisp and hoppy, with a touch of brown-sugary / candy sweetness.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
947,"2005-10-03",4.2,"Tap @ Three Floyds into my 16-oz. snifter.  Time to go against the grain here... Dull, mostly murky and taffy brown in color with a thin sheet of white for the head.  Aroma is cleansing and alluring, promulgating lemon, shortbread, wafers, burlap and ginger root.  Moving the snifter down an inch from nose to mouth, and weve confirmed suspicions that this is damn good.  English hop profile in the way that its bitter, chafing and pulling me in its direction.  Chafe me, sweeten me; chafe, sweeten The sequence continues to churn as we go but there are still more complexities to address.  Citric qualities provide more of a sweet, tight and tiny bite.  Then theres the malts.  Thats another story - though somewhat inexplicable, I can feebly deduce a spawned sugary cornbread characteristic with a floral saffron accent.  Were also looking at a faint accentuation of chamomile and lavender.  Bitter, resounding finish with a tiny, crisp copper kiss.  A great runner in the Three Floyds offerings.  King of the California Common class and hopefully one to make an annual appearance.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
947,"2005-10-03",3.2,"Draft at Three Floyds.  This poured like an unfiltered apple cider: murky and brownish.  Foamy beige head.  Malty, floral notes to the nose.  Less hoppiness than youd expect from 3F.  The mouthfeel was medium to full with what seemed like some of the ingredients still apparent in tiny solid particles.  A little fizziness in the mouth.  Pleasant taste.  Slightly sweet malt and a cut of mild hops.  Pretty good for the style.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
947,"2005-10-03",3.4,"Draft, at 3Floyds. In the Floyds plastic cup, it looks dark brown with yellowish highlights. Taste is grainy with rough unfinished notes. Hops seem to have been ripped from the vine and then thrown into the kettle screaming live live lobsters. Grains may have been crushed under a leather boot heel and then mashed in used bath water to creatre a pushy, bitchy beer. Youll like it, too.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
947,"2005-10-02",3.6,"Pretty good overall, as already said before this pretty much lacks the kick that you want out of a three floyds brew but it still is introducing me to a style that I may be able to enjoy as my palate develops. Brown in color with little to know head. The nose is malty with subtle hops in the background. THe taste is just about the same. Pretty good.","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SubstanceT"
947,"2005-10-01",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2005 I sat there and wondered, could I actually find a steam beer I liked?  Well, I think so.  Now, I dislike Anchor Steam, and I realize that this beer is a replicale, but it must be because its so fresh that this beer rates as well as it does (for me).  It smells like Anchor Steam, but better.  Its got that strange aroma thats hard to describe thats apparent in all CCs.  It looks pretty thin and is brown with a white head.  The flavor is nice.  Malts and fresh hops.  Very oddly exciting.  Im liking this.  This beer is WAY better than Anchor Steam.  Fresh.

I am told that fresh Anchor Steam is also good.  Now, I just wish that we got some fresh stuff out in the midwest!  Perhaps the shelf life of this style is 1 week?","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
947,"2005-10-01",2.8,"A decent enough steam beer, sweet malt with a light herbal/floral hopping.  I understand that this was the 05 Indiana Brewers Guild beer, but I really missed the 3F signature hopping.  Good session material.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

947,"2005-10-01",2.8,"Sampled the day of the Behemoth release in 2005. POured a dark brown and orange color. The aroma is fresh soybeans and some restrained floral hops. The taste was sweet green beans and some syrup. There was also some roasted peanuts. Not sure what the goal was with this beer.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
947,"2005-09-30",2.7,"Seems like a weird style to shoot for by these guys...not particularly known as a hopped-up brew (which this brewer is well respected for) but Ill drink anything they offer.   Mild malt sweetness with an equally mild hop bitterness to balance things somewhat...but just nothing to excite or inspire...AH! But the Behemoth!!!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
