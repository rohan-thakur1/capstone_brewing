The nose first shows a lot of steel tank notes but eventually matures into light roasted malts then finishes with a very Islay peaty aroma (think swampy, smoked malt). 

The palate is well carbonated and light bodied but creamy and well done. The flavor is very peaty and swampy. Tastes more akin to a whiskey than a beer but without the hard alcoholic bite. Still very good though. I would hesitate to buy a whole bottle unless its shared.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

3077,"2016-04-06",4.5,"Dark brown, almost black, pour. Outstanding head volume, quite outstanding retention and lacing. 

Rich Rauchbier style nose that is world class. Bacon cooking over a campfire aroma with emphasis on the wood smoke. Subtle notes of roast, molasses and dark fruit lurk underneath. As it warms, a light licorice note mingles with the campfire.

Medium body that is smooth in texture and has nice creamy aspects in the finish. Superb carbonation that has an effervescent tingle in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.

The flavor profile is world class, rich in complexity and extremely well balanced. This balance is exemplified by smoke not dominating the palate as was the case in the nose. Rising to balance, is a rich sweet base that is heavy caramel with very subtle hints of bakers chocolate. The middle hints at bitterness, but serves as the smoke / caramel battleground. As the middle fades, plum, fig and raisin flavors separate. The finish is preceded by a light licorice note just before the aged oak aspect arrives. The finish is a slow fade of smoke, caramel, oak, and a hint of alcohol that delivers a drying finish with a hint of heat.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

3077,"2015-11-10",4.0,"Hey look! I havent rated ""Smoke"" yet! 
Pours a very deep crimson, without bright lights the sucka looks black. Its got a tan head that is tight, medium sized and well retained. The lacing is nice. Grate lookin bier mydudes!
 The aroma is rich and smoky evoking smoked meats for sure, some sorta sweet glazed ham or something. Its got some nice vanilla and woodiness to it too. Generally speaking its real sweet smelling but I think given the sort of woody on smoky nose, that sweetness is a positive thing here. 
The flavor is really truly a delicious practice in balance. Its smoky for sure, its quite rich, ashy, and chocolaty. The roasty bitterness and light fruity character are the deviations that are best employed for balance here. As the beer warms both the vanilla like sweetness and wood come more and more forward, but so does some of the roasty bitterness. 

So often with smoked beers caution is thrown to the wind in the pursuit of smoked malt goodness... I love beers like that, but I also love this beer for transcending that.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

The most prominent word on the label is ""smoke"" in all caps, so my expectations are for a heartily smoky beer. There are pleasant hints of dark fruits, chocolate, wood and far away cigars. The palate is robust, but not that huge considering the abv. Malty flavors dominate with timid fruity suggestions coming through. I dont get a ton of oak, but its there. The chocolatey malt profile melds nicely with smoky undertones. Personal tastes in beer are obviously widely subjective and varied. I enjoyed this beer a lot and its clearly well crafted.

3077,"2014-09-07",3.5,"Thanks to largadeer for opening this at the post-post-RS party tasting. Reviewed from notes. Poured into a taster glass.


A - Pours black with a very tiny mocha colored head leaving no lacing at all down the glass.


S - Good amount of roasted malts up front but the smoke is not far behind. Some nice chocolate and vanilla sweetness comes thru as the smokey darkness begins to let up. Just o.k. really.


T - Plenty of dark roasted malts in this one. A nice mix of chocolate and coffee flavors starts to break thru once the smokey malt dies down a bit. The smoke is quite pronounced as you might expect and never really leaves the party. Not too bad but nothing mind blowing here.


M - Medium-Heavy body and flavors with moderately low carbonation. A bit light in the feel with tons of lingering smokey dark roast in the finish.


D - Decent stuff. I enjoy porters quite a bit but this one was just too smokey to really enjoy. I could drink one of these but that is about it.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

3077,"2014-03-28",4.1,"2012 bottle based on the stamp in the wax; 8.2% ABV. Some rust along cap, but there was a hiss when it opened. 
Aroma has a moderate smoke character, but ii is not completely overwhelming. Light chocolate character is noticeable with some faint dark fruit character. 
Pours dark brown, almost black but not quite completely opaque along the edges. Fairly large, moderately thick, light mocha head that exhibits pretty good retention. Light lacing and fairly small legs. 
Flavor has a nice sweetness that goes well with the moderate chocolate notes that are upfront. Light roast mid palate helps welcome in a medium light smoke character that lingers a bit in the finish with some dark chocolate. Light dark fruit notes of plum, prune and fig along with some faint dark caramel and toffee notes.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation and has a nice silky, creaminess to it. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a very nice smoked beer that has aged surprisingly well. The smoke character doesnt overwhelm the underlying beer so the rich chocolate notes, dark fruit and caramel have a chance to show through.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3077,"2012-03-01",4.1,"750ml bottle from mattyb83, thanks Matt! Pours a black body with a finger-width, dense, creamy and frothy, dark brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is a really nice balance between the clean, woody peat and sweet, soft malts. Hickory smoked wood, chocolate, licorice, some dark fruits, and a light roast. Flavor is similar. Roasts and smoky peat greet the tongue before a good amount of rich chocolate malts come in. Woody throughout with some coffee, a few dark fruits, and a light licorice before the smoke, roasts, and woody peat grow slightly into the finish where this is dry and moderately bitter, but very well balanced with a creamy, rich chocolate malt. I get a little hop resin contributing to the bitterness as well. Lengthy aftertaste with just a hint of alcohol warmth following a smooth, medium body and a soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty awesome beer. Soft, easy drinking, complex, and well balanced with lots of the Baltic porter base showing up and plenty of woody peat and smoke, but not so much as to completely take over the beer. I thoroughly enjoyed this.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

With the smell you really dont get the full effect of this beer.  Its really not until you get to the taste that you really understand why this is called Smoke.  The smell is light on smokiness, roasted malt, chocolate, and oak.   Really nice. 

But when you take your first sip, you are really greeted by the smoke.  Smoke and burnt malt attacks the palette.  But then the beer takes a turn.  Its like a two step process.  Attack the palette with a barrage of smoke, then turn around and give us a really nice mixture of coffee, chocolate, oak, vanilla, alcohol, etc.  The ending of this beer is just fantastic.  Like I said, its  a tale of two beers here.

3077,"2012-01-10",5.0,"A. This bear pours a beautiful pitch black color, with a light caramel head about 1 finger thick. It faded to a nice thin ring, with a little lily pad making its way around the center.

S. Smells of light caramel, strong bacon and of course, smoke. The bacon smell is really dominate. Almost the same as when you first set a piece into a hot pan. I can almost hear the crackle when I smell this beer :)

S. A noticeable hickory comes out first, that holds through even after your done drinking. A a smoked, almost burnt toffee taste comes through extremely smoothly. It isnt at all overbearing. The malts are noticeable, but not a dominate trait.

M. Very smooth flavor, that is not at all hard to drink. The flavor is thick and bold, but it still feels light on the tongue. Just a hint of dryness on the finish. 

O. Overall this is a complex beer, that is extremely smooth and very easy to drink. I could see spending many hours at a bar not trying anything else if this was on-tap. It delivers everything you expect from Surly. Unlike a lot of their beers that tend to take a style to its extreme, I think this hits spot on for what I would expect to see in a quality baltic porter.

This is by far one of the top beers I have ever had! It is amazingly smooth and easy to drink. The flavors are bold, but also complex. Its not a one sided smoke flavor like often what happens with Porters. The tastes changes and matures in your mouth. I look forward to having this beer again and again.","Minnesota, USA","MBrausen"

3077,"2011-12-30",3.9,"Appearance: pours like liquid peat and smoke under a creamy head. Fades into a lacey collar bordering a broken khaki film. Swirls bubbly.

Nose: smoke and bacon and smoke and bacon, ohmy! Smoldering fireplace, logs crackling and cracking and sparking in the back. Also in the back  cacao beans and espresso chocolate cake. Black bread and esters of horse blankets and leather. Smoked salmon?

Palate: mouthfeel is rich, creamy, smooth, bready, and cakey. Smoke is subtle and pervasive but never overwhelming. Dry finish of firewood. Smoked salmon and bacon, smoked prunes and dates, and smoke in the breath. Chocolate black cake. Peat. Dark stone fruits in the back of each and every swallow  meaty, dense, and rich. Burnt caramel. Horse and horse blankets underneath with tannin inclinations. Slowly grows more parching in the finish. Lovely.

Final Thoughts: good beer does come in a can. Oskar Blues started it and Surly continues the honorable trend of canned craft beer. The only thing that would make me happier than a can of Surly in my glass would be Surly in my glass in Florida. Surly Smoke turns its nose at the can for this particular beer though, choosing instead the waxed confines of a glass 750ml bomber. Either way, yum!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Ive had this from bottles and on tap a few times, but I just happened to open a bottle now, so Im basing this review on it.

Appearance:
Pretty much black. If I hold it up to my light nothing gets through it. Creamy/fizzy off-white head, about 2 fingers. It settles after a minute or two, leaving some lacy spikes.

Smell:
I can tell why its called smoke. It smells a lot like that smoked tea, lapsang souchong (sp?). Behind that are hints of raisin and dark chocolate.

Taste:
More raisiny than the smell had me expecting, topped by a dried plum taste. The smoke flavor is loud and clear, but it feels more like a smell than a taste. It floats off of your tongue. Licorice is predominant in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel:
Thick, not quite chewy, with some alcohol vapors coming off of your tongue. Not highly carbonated, and very smooth. Goes down like smoky silk.

Drinkability:
Pretty good. I can polish off one of the 750ml bottles in a sitting and be pretty happy. I dont know if Id be likely to get it at a bar, but I really like it as kind of a ""staying in for the night"" kind of drink.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

Taste: Oak and smoke is very predominant, with nice rounded semi-sweet malts of molasses, plum, licorice and figs. Ends with a touch of spicy and bitter hops, which co-mingle nicely with the smoke.

Palate: Low carbonation, smooth and creamy lager body that is somewhat full bodied.

Pours a dark amber-brown with a nice off white head. The nose is really quite smoky, although it doesnt go so far that its overpowering. A bit meat. Roasted malt and some dark fruits and chocolate underneath. Quite complex. Taste is a bit less so, as there is some general chocolate and roast below the heavy smoke character, but the smoke is definitely stealing the show. All the smoke and meaty flavors bring a nice mouthfeel, and this drinks quite well, especially comparing it against similar beers.

For me, thats probably a good thing.  This tastes like the char remains that are scraped off the grill along with chocolate, vanilla, and a little dark fruit.  Underneath the smoke, the body is slicker and creamier than expected.  Again, thats a good thing as the smoke isnt completely dominant.  Its just not too ashy, bitter, or gritty as I sort of feared it might be.

3.5 M: Lighter body and perhaps too thin. Carbonation is also a little low, or perhaps it stays in solution too well. Other than that, smooth with a smoky finish.

3.5 D: Good beer, but a lot of room to improve. The base recipe is solid, but a higher mash temp and some flaked barley or wheat could do wonders.

Now, the smoke here is what youre buying, and it does have a smoked sausage character but it is still lower than the average in this style.

Aroma is dominated by heavily smoked chocolate malts with some caramel and cocoa as well.  There is a little bit of spent espresso grounds in the background.

Taste is sweeter with chocolate and caramel up front before the wave of smoked wood starts to take over.  The finish is dry, woody and all about the smoke.

Ive always like a good smoked beer so this one hit the spot for me.  Lots of smoky character but still very drinkable.  Good stuff.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

This one is the perfect smoke beer with the right balance. 
Dark brown in color, light tan head.
Smoked malts blend perfectly with the oak that at times might appear to be in hindsight. Not over the top, and a tad extra smoke would have been even better.

3077,"2010-06-07",4.1,"Review # 1000! Thanks a lot to traviserickson for sending this one to me in a recent trade.

Pours pitch black and completely opaque without even a trace of lighter color when held to a light source. Two finger frothy mocha colored head that slowly fades into a lasting ring. Minimal spots of lacing.

Roasty aroma that isnt is smokey as I expected with lots of dark malt notes. Hints of vlbitter dark chocolate, oatmeal, toffee, coffee bean, burnt toast and subtle spice. There is still a good bit of smokey aromas traditionally associated with smoked/rauchbiers. Hints of charcoal, campfire, ash etc. But again, there is a lot going on making it less one dimensional. Different and comex but not as intensely smokey as I prefer in the nose.

Chewy, viscous medium body that again, is only slightly smokey. Very well balanced with lots of luscious chocolate malt goodness. Slightly spivey possibly with anise as well as some hops to comiment the roasty/smokey notes. Hints of deep roasted coffee bean, bittersweet dark chocolate, burnt toast and toffee. As in the aroma, the smokiness isnt as intense as expected. Only subtle hints of vampire, butane, bacon, charcoal, BBQ, etc. integrated into the flavor. Very complex, excellently balanced and the high ABV is pretty well masked, making this beer ery quaffable. I really enjoyed this beer but didnt find it as smokey as I expected or hoped for. Highly recommend but I would warn the smokeheads out there that this beer isnt that intense in that regard.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

3077,"2010-05-20",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
Dark chocolate, crunchy cereals and beechwood smoke converge in this classy Barrel-Aged Smoked Baltic Porter.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the brown-edged blackness.
-The mouthfeel is relatively dry; this is not your usual portly NAmerican dessert brew.
-Roasted malts offer a few flavors, but remain subdued.
-Alcohol is not too apparent, which I appreciate.
-This is perhaps not as complex as the Ola Dubh 40 we had right before, but it is as flavorful and elegant.

Pours a pitchblack opaque pour, a bit of darker brown at the bottom where a bit of ruby light gets through, a small brown head sits atop, dense, laces a bit. Aromas are dark roasted malts, a touch of chocolate and coffee, with a decent ashy smoke to it, a touch of bonfire, cocoa, and roasted malts. Initial is a decent smokey kick coupled with roasted malts and coffee, a medium body, shorter of what I expected, fairly smooth on the palate with a more dominant smoke, then roast, coffee comes in behind with a bit of mocha chocolate behind, a bit sweet to help balance the roast and smoke. Pretty good bitterness and roast to finish, a pleasant aftertaste and light smoke and roast sticks to the palate overall.

The aroma is bold up front, strong smoked malts and peat coming through first.  Chocolate, dark caramel, and oaky vanilla follow, with figs, raisin, and earthy spice emerging towards the end.  Flavors follow suit, very chocolaty, with heaps of burnt caramel and vanilla.  Smoked peat and hints of salty meat permeate throughout.  Figs, raisins, and even hints of cherries separate this one as a Baltic, for sure.  Medium-plus on the tongue, with balanced carbonation, a silky mouthfeel, and a semi-dry finish, a little more body would b nice.

3077,"2008-10-29",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2010 Cask @ Darkness Day in my brand new Darkness tulip.  I was told this was aged on in cedar barrels. Each of the beers served there came in 3 forms, tap, out of the bright tank, and cask.  In hindsight I should have not tried a smoked, barrel aged, Baltic porter on cask, but either way here we go.  I was watching the de-bunging of the cask and got one of the first pours. Its completely black, nothing but blackness.  That includes any semblance of a head or lacing, again completely nothing after just a few seconds after the pour. Aroma is smoke (lightly sweet, lightly BBQ) which I like.  Behind that is an oily astringent licorice, I dont like that. Taste has more of that licorice astringency with the smoke on the back end.  Mouthfeel is lightly oily and of course very undercarbonated. It seems where well structured I just needed to try it NOT on cask.  I will definitely give this another go around if I come across it on tap. 7/4/7/3/14
Had this out of the bright tank at Darkness day, one year later.  Was really hoping to love this but I was again disappointed, not a bad beer but nothing special.  The smoke is there, its not really backed up with anything, just some watery dark malts and light licorice. Re-rate out of the bottle, shared by Dansting.

The place to be for most of the day was Surly.  Always bustling with activity I made it a point to be there for as many of the special tappings as I could.  This one was no exception.  About a year old (2007 vintage) this shows no signs of going downhill.  If it were bottled like the Darkness I think the guys in Brooklyn Center would have another hot commodity on their hands.

Aroma / Appearance - The black body was covered by a thin tan head and wrapped in decorative lacing.  Candy sguar, coffee, sweet creamers and a pleasant smokiness highlighted the best parts of a world class baltic porter.  Taking the best of the easily available releases and raising the bar this has to be one of the best on the planet.

Flavor / Palate - Cocoa powder, sugar and dark chocolate wash smoothly across the tongue.  The creamy mouthfeel makes this very drinkable.  A smoky finish accents an already solid beer.  Very balanced and smooth this is something worth trying when you find yourself with the opportunity.  Only the Darkness might be better.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3077,"2008-01-19",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2008 Tap at the Blue Nile.  Burly black with a skirting skin of off white.  Aroma is unusual but not off the map; notes of blueberry and cinnamon accent the body of roast beef and au jus with a light hint of heat.  The smoke is subtle and polished, and stays for the most part in that arena of rich beef rather than straying into maple bacon and hickory territory.  Flavors has a lot of cold fruitiness and rich sweetness, like caramelized pears and sugar dipped figs let to roast over a bonfire; belgian chocolate in large quantities with fudge, graham crackers, and tart red berries.  Light tones of sweet bourbon and vanilla type of spirited heat, soft and complementing.  Palate is juicy, dense, and full; finish tends toward a wet, dessert wine type of fruitiness and extends itself lazily.  Certainly a Baltic first, and a smoked second, this is a great example of a warming dark ale that effortlessly skirts the frustrating imperial stout-isms of overstretched hops, sugars, and alcohol, while still providing that contemplative strength needed in the dead of winter.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

The smoke kicks up in the flavor, and I got a mouthful of Virginia smoked ham along with the malt and chocolate, somehow blending together in a most satisfactory fashion.

Where the version at Chef Pauls was lacking in smoke, this time smoke was very evident. Hints of smoke in the nose. Fully opaque with a tan ring. Caramelly, smoky goodness.

The flavor is also lightly sweet with a touch of fruit, but this is quite dry for a Baltic porter.  I would like it to be a little sweeter.

This is one of the most lightly hopped beers Surly has brewed, and is more traditional than some of their products in a style that doesnt rely on massive hops for flavor or aroma.

3077,"2007-12-20",4.5,"Served very cold in a tulip-like goblet at Muddy Pig: Plain glossy black. No head was present when served on any of my orders? Im sure, perhaps at point of pour there may have been, but I saw none. A glare of oily residue coats the glass while flecks and specks of lace frantically stick about the surface.

Heavy, dark, aroma of deep dark fruity tanged fig, raisin, with a nice rounded black malt sweetness. Crisp and fresh smelling at first wiff. Only slight smoked ascents at first but it grows with a delicate and gradual nudge as it warms. Creating more smoked bacon tendencies as it goes as does a bit more roasted deepness.

Wonderfully broad deep flavors. Clean, invitingly deep, lasting flavors of all sorts of malts with caramel smoothness, black malt sweetness, roasted malt dryness, and smoked malt tangyness. Mildly figgy and raisin paste make for a nice quick tang of a dark fruity nature upfront. The smoked meat flavors are a near perfect match as it is never overpowering in any fashion. Its just a mild yet fulfillingly rich and well blended tone all across the palate. Notes of burnt rubarb pie, black cracked pepper, cocoa, and vanilla create nice little additional things among the smokey realm of its character. Lots of subtle layers and melding flavors in this one. A smoked crockpot of malts if you will. Nice!

Body is smooth, clean, and partially silky with a well handled tang of dark fruit and smoke. Tends to get slippery real quick as its medium body isnt a thick monster of malt. Its quite casual and leads you easily into a lull of drinkin ease and great flavors.

The drinkability is outstanding! Ahhh, but here is where I think that term ""Smoke"" came from other then the obvious use of smoked malts. As its the ABV that renders itself like smoke from a fire smoldering in your head. It builds slowly at first, filling your head gradually with smoke, eventually, and before you know it your head is a blaze of swimming glee from the ABV. Wow, one sneaky fuckin beer! Watch out for this one, be sure to drink water to help slow the smoke. Whew...","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

The aroma of Smoke is...well Smoke. Appearance is also tantalizingly similar to Darness- Solid black with a large cocoa head. The taste is pleasing milk chocolate and liquor. Mouthfeel is as silky as it gets. Without significant hop taste (unique for Surly) you really get a view of their craft expertise in how flawless the mouthfeel is. The smoke is by no means overwhelming but adds a dimension of interest to a baltic porter that would have been wonderful without it. The alcohol is surreptitious - its there but its not...kinda like smoke.

This is probably the most creative beer at FoBAB 2007, and the one most up my alley.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"
3077,"2007-11-04",4.2,"FoBAB 2007: Opaque with a fading head but left oily legs upon the glass. The aroma has a beautiful smoky nose along with plum, raisin, hazelnut, oak and bready esters. The taste has an initial malty profile with a background of ripened fruits, A big smoky and meaty finish is nearly perfect. A lovely flavorful beer. The mouth feel is lush and smooth with a smoky and barrel dryness upon the finish. A wonderful brew and one of my favorites at the fest.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Black body with a tan head.  Creamy palate.  Very easy drinking.  I dont get the strength of a baltic porter here, instead this reminds me of a smoked porter, nutty roasted flavor with a touch of smoke.   This may be Surlys most ""to style"" beer to date, not necessarily pushing the style boundaries, as they do with many of their other beers.  Given this is a Surly special release, I was expecting more and so in that sense, it was a bit of a let down.  
On a side note, the naming of this beer is somewhat disturbing.  I hope they change the name.  Dahmer is not a guy Id like to think about when drinking a Surly beer.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
3077,"2007-10-01",3.8,"[ABR 07] Pours black with a small dark brown head.  Smoky, roasted malt aroma.  The roasted malt is much stronger in the taste, along with some nice chocolate and some more of the smokiness.  Medium mouthfeel.  Long finish.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"
