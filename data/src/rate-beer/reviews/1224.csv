This is a solid doppelbock. Being my first experience with Capital in a few years it feels as if something has changed. I cant put a finger on it but the quality seems to have slipped since I was there regularly. That said they remain one of the best brewers in Wisconsin and worth picking up if you see them around the Midwest.

Aroma / Appearance - Traces of transparency peek through a deep reddish brown base. A flimsy ivory head collapses in on itself. Apple pie, chocolate, and thin mints make me feel as if I am at a dessert table.

Flavor / Palate - The fluid mouthfeel is driven by flat cola, chocolate, and plums. While it does not feel as if it was off the characteristic depth of a typical Capital beer was missing. Even the warm glow that hangs in the back of the throat could not redeem this. Ill give them a few more chances before I write them off though.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Medium to full-bodied; Strong roasty flavour with a good sweet caramel flavour and a pungent toffee note and a lot of roast on the back end. Aftertaste shows a good complexity with a nice malty, yet caramel flavour that goes a long while and shows very nicely. Overall, a very good beer for the style with plenty of sugars and a good malt backbone with a nice complexity.

1224,"2011-02-20",3.4,"20-Feb-11 (12-oz bottle: Obtained in trade with CaptainCougar, thanks Tom!)  Unintentionally aged a bit longer than desired, this beer is still alive and kicking.  Very sweet on the palate, with sweet malt, caramelized sugar, bushels of raisins, figs, and dates, a fair amount of melanoidin character, some toastiness, and a hint of earthiness, but also moderate oxidation, which is to be expected.  Full-bodied on the palate, sweet and a bit cloying, with moderate carbonation.  The nose is malty, fruity, somewhat candy-like, toasty, caramely.  A clear, mahogany body is capped by a thin, beige head that settles to a thin ring, leaving a few spots of lace on the glass.

1224,"2005-12-30",4.1,"2005 bottle from StewardofGondor, shared on 12/22/2005 with Rastacouere.  Pours your typical Capital pour, that is, lightly hazy, with a bubbly head that is quick to run for cover of the edges, and only leaves marginal, spotty lacing.  Head is beige while the body is a deep auburn tinged mahogany brown, with coal brown hues.  Aroma of sweet raisins, cream, milk chocolate and light touches of dry bock yeast.  Tinges of tart fruits combine on the end to give a well-balanced, and quite authentic feel to it.  Raisins, caramel, light breadiness and vinous dark fruits all in abundance.  Flavor is quite sweet, with a soft milk chocolate sweetness that gives way to a light bit of earthiness and dry yeast.  Berry skins, roasted, but minimally bitter barley notes and succulent, warm, dripping caramel.  Flowery, lightly herbal hops are just faintly noticeable.  Dosent have that hard crystal malt dryness and intense breadiness.  While it seems that overly bready, grainy, sourish munich malts and such seem to be the majority take on this style, Ive got to say that this creamier, more milk chocolatey take increases the drinkability and sensuousness on the palate, while the light raisins and boisterous plum/prunes add a needed dryness, with a touch of light tartness.  As with other Capital beers the carbonation is very low, the bubbles loose and the mouthfeel a touch wet.  It would certainly benefit from tighter carbonation, but yet, its sort of a house character for Capital, and who really cares about carbonation when the flavors are so true and rich.  The liquid bread goes down effortlessly, with no trace of any alcohol.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Wow. Except for the vegetal nature of the aroma, this is the best of Capitals impressive doppelbock series. Pours a clear deep mahogany red-brown with medium-thin but well-formed foamy white head that leaves substantial lacing on its way down. As mentioned before, the aroma has a strong vegetal element that put me off, but there was also good sweet malt backbone there. That backbone obviously makes up the better part of the flavor, along with a touch of toasted grain, a hint of black licorice, and a rather complementary alcohol flavor that is at the same time quite noticeable but not at all intrusive (it is quite smooth and not harsh or warming). Medium-thick mouthfeel with creamy, chewy palate. God I love this brewery, and beers like this is why.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

Soft, slick body, along with  the rich breadiness, quickly caress the gentle alcoholic push.  Delectably sweet with lengthy notes of candied, grapey malts. Drastically improves with each sip, especially as it warms, as the body thickens to reveal an artful contrast of dry, grainy roastiness and slick fruitiness over a cakey malt base. Perceptible tannic acidity tingles the palate and deepens the subtle bready richness. Finishes crisply malt-defined, yet, simultaneously  jammy-thick and fruity with black licorice hints.

Medium-bodied and smooth with a well-rounded array of flavors, from malt, caramel and vanilla to nuts and hops. The only downside is the flavor disappears quickly.

1224,"2005-01-10",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2005 December 2005 bottle, consumed December 2005.Deep, translucent chestnut brown in color with a short, creamy white-to-grey head.  Milk chocolate bubble gum leads the aromatic display, along with slight plastic band-aids crossed with chocolate scented scratch n sniff stickers.  Some caramel contributions and a dry pecan edge in the nose as well.  Wonderful milky sweetness oozes in for the flavor portion, equally imparted with caramel, chocolate toffee and honey roasted hazelnuts.  Dry crackle at the sides of the tongue mimic the teeth snapping unsalted pecans, and its likely aftermath.  Sweet, viscous syrup accents akin to maple vats, imparting a pacified wooden smoothness.  Only detraction is a bubblegum current of a failed Bubble Yum chocolate-flavored gum experiment (would that I could blame this character flaw on their bottling operation in Monroe, where a dark shadow is cast on the Wisconsin brewing industry as a whole.)  Perfectly succinct and balanced, finishing like buttery Rolos hammered onto Heath bars.  Barely skips a beat from last years version, and I still love this doppelbock to death.December 2004 bottle, consumed January 2005.Excellent beer - definitely one of (if not) the best doppelbocks Ive ever had.  Pours a deep ruby brown.  Little to no head with small lacing - one of the lighter doppelbocks Ive had.  It didnt appear to be as thick as I was expecting when I poured it into the glass, but the taste delivered.  Smooth and complex semi-sweet chocolate malt nodes and moderate carbonation.  Definitely a rich, whole-mouth experience.  Tastes yeasty, almost like a liquid bread made with brown sugar.  Traces of oak and roasted nuts.  Alcohol is very well hidden and isnt evident even in the finish.  Leaves a nice nutty, malty aftertaste which I can still remember and pine for as I write this review.

I think I had been resorting to rating a little too much by style, rather just on a beers own merits - and especially when I pick up a beer in one of my favorite styles, Im going to take notice when it doesnt completely match up to the standard (in the case of doppels, Celebrator sets the standard for me).  But while this may lack some of the huge melanoidiny Munich malts of Celebrator and others, this turns out to be a very nice easy drinking dark lager.

Wiff...Ahhh....Hello...Malts! One major malty nose, quite hefty and full of tangy sweetness, characteristics of a ton of toffee, some dark orangeyness, with plum, raisin and starfruit.

Taste is more of the same - highlighting a huge malty sweet tang, very full, bold, lightly chewy, steady even sweet toffee loaded goodness upfront with a slight roastyness to it, then heads right into soft sweet citrus of very dark orange mixing lightly with raisin and plum notes and a bit of molasses. Interesting light hoppyness comes through near the end giving a texture of a earthy bold taste thats short lived and then finishes with a quick little smokey nutty sense thats also short lived and then heads right back to a light tangy grab on the tongue. Quite a complex brew. Nothing out of the ordinary and what I come to expect out of Capital when it comes to the dopplebock. Had to have two bottles cuz its complexity is perplexing; plus its yummy good eh.

Yet another top quality Doppelbock from the lager maestro.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"
