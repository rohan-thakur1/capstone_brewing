The nose is essentially a sweeter, boozier version of regular Pumking, with a sharp alcohol aroma and a cloying caramel tone slightly masking the blend of pumpkin, spices, and pastry dough.

67,"2015-03-03",3.7,"Bottled November 6, 2014.
Glass: Carton teku.
Appearance: Hazy amber body with barley a head, its a small white coating.
Aroma: Sweet pumpkin pie (vanilla, graham cracker, cinnamon) is apparent with a hint of a slight sour vegetable tinge, hints of oak and rum. It shows the base with a slightly boozy rum barrel accent.
Taste: This tastes like Pumking in rum barrels, to put it bluntly. Vanilla, graham cracker, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove blend with hints of oak and present rum, slightly boozy. Nice to drink, I dont think its an improvement, but its different.
Palate: Full-bodied, mild to moderately carbonated, slightly oily.
Overall: Enjoyable, wish it had been released earlier though. I would have appreciated this a lot more in the Autumn. As I said this is exactly what one would expect from a rum barrel Pumking. I imagine this could be somewhat easily simulated by pouring a shot of rum into a few month old Pumking.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Minimal herbal/spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, gingerbread, nutmeg, brown sugar, pie crust, spiced rum, light vanilla/oak, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a good bit.

Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barrel aged pumpkin ale style. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of bready malt, pumpkin, spices, and light-moderate rum barrel flavors; and very smooth to drink for the big ABV.

Nose is the standard Pumking riot of candied squash, vanilla, spice.
For once, though, the use of liquor barrels isnt a mere gimmick. Instead of simply adding alcohol harshness and heat, the rum inflection complements the base brew.
Pumking isnt the best pumpkin beer, though it may be the best choice for those seeking pumpkin pie in a glass. I can appreciate its in-your-face candied gourdness compared to pumpkin brews that seem embarrassed and just want to blend in with nondescript ales, but its not exactly polished.
Here the rum flavor adds adult sophistication to the candy sweetness, bumping the flavor profile from candy corn to caramel. Its an entirely successful tweak, and, price aside, should win over some drinkers who do not hold the standard Pumking in high regard. This is better.","","Pumpkin87"

67,"2014-12-14",4.6,"Southern Tiers Pumking has always been my favorite pumpkin beer, as well as one of my favorite beers in general. I didnt think they could improve upon it, but somehow they managed to do so by aging it in rum barrels. If any spirit would complement this type of brew, rum is definitely it - the natural spices and sweetness work to accentuate the authentic pumpkin pie flavor of this brew.

I poured a 22oz bottle into the official Southern Tier Pumking goblet. It was bottled on 11/6/14 and cost $15.99 ($0.73 per ounce).

Appearance: Clear orange hue, little carbonation visible. Pours to a small, white, soapy head which fizzles away quickly and leaves no lacing. Alcohol legs are easily visible, though.

Smell: Sweet pumpkin pie aroma, especially of cinnamon and nutmeg. Distinct rum alcohol presence as well, but its subtle and complementary  not distracting. 

Taste: What has always set Pumking apart from other pumpkin beers is that it tastes like graham cracker crust, as well as actual pumpkin puree. That taste component is found here as well, though somehow it seems even stronger. Huge cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and clove spiciness are all prominent throughout the palette. Theres also a constant sweet pumpkin pie flavor from the pumpkin puree, which is enhanced due to the rum barrel aging. Vanilla is quite strong as is the taste of rum, though it lacks to aggressive booziness of an actual spirit. Little in the way of true bitterness, though the natural spice and alcohol character do offer balance (not that the sweetness is cloying, anyway). Delicious all around for sure. 

Drinkability: The 10.7% ABV on the label was a bit intimidating, though I pleasantly surprised by how easily drinkable Southern Tier Rum Barrel Aged Pumking is. The mouthfeel is a little thin, slightly crisp and a tad slick. However, it is absolutely no challenge to get down despite the robustness of the palette and the warmth from the alcohol (which is rather gentle). It finishes almost completely clean, which makes it easy to go from sip to sip. No need to pair this with anything as its a dessert in and of itself.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

67,"2014-12-09",4.0,"Poured a light orange/gold colour with a thin white head. Aroma is of pumpkin, vanilla, and spiced rum. Flavor is rich with warm with the usual creamy pumpkin and spice, but with a nice rum warmth. Alcohol is hidden well in this medium bodied that ends in a warm sweet finish. Like this better than the original.","Ohio, USA","TheCaptMatey"

67,"2014-12-07",4.0,"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 11/06/14. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with about a half inch off-white head that fizzled away quickly. Pretty much no lacing at all. Aroma is sweet and spicy, the brew smells like nutmeg, pumpkin pie, vanilla, and a bit of rum/booze. Taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also some honey, graham cracker and a woody bitterness noticeable. Seemed sharp and boozy to me at first, but the brew improved as it warmed. Guess I didnt let this one warm up enough before I started drinking it (STs website recommended drinking temps of 40-50F degrees, I say closer to 50F if not higher than that would be better). Mouthfeel/body is medium, its coating with low/moderate carbonation. I liked this brew, but I dont think its quite as good as regular Pumking. Still glad I got to try this, although at $16.99 a bomber I wouldnt buy it again at that price.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
67,"2014-12-06",3.6,"A good novelty beer. The original Pumking is hard to live up to. Ive had the bourbon barrel and this and while they add a different dimension to the beer, the seem to jumble it. Aroma was straight up Pumking. Vanilla, graham cracker, whipped cream and nutmeg. Pour was a nice medium gold with no head. Taste was like the original in the beginning but mid swallow, the mouth got extremely dry and light rum and wood notes came out on the top of the tonsils in the finish. Very odd how the flavor just left and let the alcohol take over. Kind of muddled the beer, but it was a nice experiment nonetheless. Mild carbonation","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
67,"2014-12-01",3.7,"22oz bottle, from Dutchs. Clear orange color. Thin off-white head. Some dots and bits of lace. Much like pumking, there is a lot of pumpkin pie, whipped cream flavors in the nose. Maybe a bit more spiciness, and a slight bit more an alcohol bite than standard pumking, with some woody rum type flavors. Graham cracker. Medium to bigger body, but not as thick as expected or as Id like, kind of slightly thin for a 10.7% pumpkin beer. Smooth, kind of creamy crisp lighter carbonation. Lightly slick. Fun beer. Not as full nor thick as expected, but surprisingly easy-drinking, kind of crisp. Like someone dropped a shot of rum into a moderate-to-stronger pumpkin beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

67,"2014-11-29",4.0,"22 oz. bomber purchased at Bellport Cold Beer & Soda. Pours a clear orange gold with a very thin linen white head that lasted through the first sip and left light lace on the glass. Very pleasant aroma of fresh pumpkins with light pumpkin pie spices. The flavor is very reminiscent of a fresh piece of pumpkin pie, with the spices nailed just right and fresh pumpkin flavor. The rum barrel, which I found absent in the nose, is present here with some rum and a bit of heat. Some vanilla detected as well. Mild bitterness at the finish. Medium-full bodied with a well-rounded mouthfeel.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
67,"2014-11-28",3.8,"A heavily spiced and sweet beer. Like drinking pumpkin pie. The rum comes through as a nice kick at the end. A good sipper but too sweet to be very drinkable.","Albany, New York, USA","spokeydonkey"
67,"2014-11-28",4.0,"Pour out of 22 oz bottle, clear orange pour with thin to no head, aroma brought big pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, whipped cream into some cane sugar, rum barrel, hints of oak into some pumpkin flesh, cracker notes as well. Taste had some big pumpkin, fleshy notes into some spice, nice crusty graham cracker and pie crust notes with some creamy, vanilla notes, slight addition of the rum with some sweet cane sugar, finishing sweet. I would personally prefer Rumpkin over this for rum barrel aging, but this beer still holds onto its pumking roots which is its best part.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
67,"2014-11-27",4.0,"Pours golden amber color with thin white head. Aroma of spice, vanilla, graham cracker, and rum. Wonderful combination of pumking and rum. Spice, vanilla, pumpkin, graham cracker, and a subtle rum. Great beer.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","alobar"
67,"2014-11-26",3.9,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate brown sugar, pumpkin pie, rum fruitcake, vanilla, graham cracker, and whipped cream. It pours a syrupy amber with a minimal white head that fizzes up to a minimal film before fading to almost nothing short of a few stray tiny bubbles. The flavor starts with brown sugar, butterscotch, and whipped cream. The finish has pumpkin pie, graham cracker, light rum, and vanilla. There is a tiny bit of heat, but not much. Its medium-full bodied with mild carbonation and a sticky mouthfeel. Overall, I really like pumpkin (pie/spice) beers and this is tasty, but I think I like the regular version a little better. While I dont particularly like rum and I really dont like butterscotch, those flavors happen to work here...Ive generally noticed rum works in barrel aged pumpkin beers. Even though it does work, I dont think it made one of my favorite pumpkin beers any better. I gave regular Pumking a 4.3.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
67,"2014-11-26",4.2,"Poured from a bomber ($16.99) into a snifter golden orange a thin white head that left almost immediately.
Aroma is butter. Minor rum. Some spices.
Flavor is Pumking hot buttered rum and beautiful. WOW. If you like rum & Pumking this is an amazing brew. Took Pumking to a whole new level. Nice moderate carbonation. Truly worth every $. Bought 2. Loved one & will lay the other down.","Ohio, USA","fitwitchik"
67,"2014-11-26",4.0,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Aroma is a buttered rum, caramel and rum with a sweet presence. Appearance is a clear light golden amber with NO head. Taste is in my opinion an improvement over standard Pumking. The rum gives it a nice warmth. It is best had at a temperature slightly cooler than room temp. Palate is good but not exceptional. Overall though I have to say it is very good and recommend you try it. Cheers!","Ohio, USA","cernjoh"
67,"2014-11-23",3.6,"Golden color with a small, white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of honey, toast, pumpkin, light spices, sweeter rum barrel, and alcohol.

67,"2014-11-23",4.0,"The aroma is beautiful. Same as the base beer, pumpkin, pumpkin spice, pie crust, like pumpkin pie in a bottle, only now with vanilla, wood, and rum. Compliments nicely. The appearance is the same amber color. The head seems smaller. The flavor is again pumpkin pie in a glass, the rum barrel doesnt change it as much, a bit more boozy, and a bit more vanilla. The finish is a bit sweeter, vanilla, not very hot for the ABV. Carbonation is low, especially compared to the base beer. Enjoyable variation on a great beer. Im glad I got to try this, but I like the base beer a little better.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
67,"2014-11-23",3.3,"Bottle. Aroma of pumpkin spices and very subtle rum. Amber body with very little carbonation. Flavor begins with rum notes, quickly followed by normal yet slightly diluted pumking flavor. Noticeable warming power.","Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA","KornDogg"
67,"2014-11-22",4.0,"Pours clear straw orange with almost no head, a few bubbles. The aroma brings similar pie crust notes and some pumpkin, but much lighter and tamer than the non barrel version. The flavors brings big rum, even rum and come from the sweetness, and then notes of the vanilla come in as well. The spices are tamed from the rum barrel for sure.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
67,"2014-11-22",4.0,"From bottle on shelf in NY. Pours an orange color with not much head. Aroma of fruity rum drinks, like it way more than I thought. Taste is nice, like pumpkin pie and rum cake? Having trouble describing it, but its nice, and I normally dont like pumpkin beers. Rum is nice in this one.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","beechner224"

67,"2014-11-20",4.2,"Bottle I picked up at AJs Beer Warehouse in Rochester. Pours a clear copper hue, white head that dies quickly to nothing. Nose is really quite sweet, pumpkin spice, a touch of rum sweetness. Tastes is really sweet, a little burn that is so nice to complement the bitterness. A slight touch of the burnt flavours you sometime get with regular Pumking. Really awesome.","Dundas, Ontario, CANADA","Hammy78"
