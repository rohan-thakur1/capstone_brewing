Rich nose of dark fruit (figs, plum), chocolate and cherries.

Medium body with a creamy texture. Perfect carbonation with just enough effervescence in the middle to cut the creamy texture and a finely bubbled prickly finish.

The flavor profile is outstanding. Intensity is reasonable, rather complex and perfectly balanced. The 12% alcohol is completely covered, which few beers accomplish. It begins with a slightly bitter dark chocolate note that gains sweetness. Chocolate yields to dark fruit as the middle approaches with fig and plum slowly taking on a cherry note. As the fruit fades, a very mild bitterness emerges along with a light prune coupled with a hint of oak. As it warms, a slightly tannic aspect is evident.

Irregular, beige, fairly stable head over a deep bronze coloured, initially clear beer.  Rich and seductive aroma of chocolate fondant, honey, gooseberry, elderberry, kiwi, melon, passion fruit, pear, cloves, leather, earthy hops, coffee grounds, cognac, brown bread...  Deep dark malty flavour, rich and full, dryish, with a pointy candied fruit sweetness in onset; very light sourishness provides structure and complexity but the title role is for the chocolatey malts, bittering a bit in the end, with a certain degree of roastedness along with warming, brandy-like alcohol and peppery hop bitter accents.

It has a light champagne scent over some coca and a basic Belgian dark ale scent.

It is decadent. It has a nice alcohol bite and some roastiness. The main flavor is dark chocolate with some ripe dark fruits. It is sweet but not overly.

Not as dark fruity or heavy roasted as expected. Much more complex and tricky with unique toasted maltiness, some resinous hops, cinammon and champagne dryness at the finish.
Dangerously well hidden alcohol, medium to full bodied. Slight acid dark grape notes matched with interesting, slightly wild (i mean barnyardy) champagne yeast aromas. Undescribable floral dryness.

Taste is pretty good starts off sweet and turns into a clean bitterness in the finish, taste milder than I expected from this big beer. Wood, grape juice that also sometimes taste like watermelon jolly ranchers, dark light tasting malts and some spice all make up the flavor. Taste is so much milder then I would have ever guessed and the alcohol is hidden very well, I would recommend this to any one because its a very easy drinking beer but easy drinking is not something you normally look for in the style.

Very sweet flavor with a touch of hop at the swallow. Described as the ""Perfect Match to Belgian Chocolate"", which may be true. But this is a brew that should be sipped. It is very rich, but with a good level of carbonation. Strong Sherry-like flavors. This doesnt taste like a typical Belgian; there isnt the Belgian yeast flavoring Id expect.

Quite light and airy on the palate. Fruit joins in the middle with just a touch of sweetness. I want to say a mild bitterness, but it really is more than I think to keep all the sweetness in check. A very nice balance in this one. Malt, anise, fruit, toasted almonds, and a hint of light chocolate. Unless you suck the foam, as a result of an over-pour, the alcohol is not to be found.

It has the bubbly carbonation like chapagne accompanied by a refined, difficult to describe aroma.  By best stab at describing the aroma is fruity, spicy, light, cola, cherry, and a tinge of alcohol.  This beer is light and airy on the palate without feeling over carbonated.  It is fruity and dark with hints of dark berries and chocolate followed by a dry, Belgian-like finish.  The alcohol isnt immediately discernable, but it is definitely there and goes to the head after a few good gulps.  After awhile, an interesting mildly tongue-numbing herbal quality starts to take over.  Overall, this is a pretty good beer, but not really my style and definitely not woth the cost for me.

Poured out a small sized rocky, light tan head that has good retention and some spotty lacing over a nice dark, hazy brown brew.

The taste is amazing and instantly comes across as highly drinkable: immediate fruit (raspberries, strawberry, raisin), caramel. The spice in surprisingly soft - the total lack of alcohol here is impressive to say the least. Round the flavour out with plums, fig, earth, licorice,... mmm. Not as good as the aroma but there is no stopping drinking this entire bottle. Mouth feel disappoints as it does come across light  an don times empty feeling but, hey, sometimes that is better than a face full of yeast.

2331,"2008-07-10",3.5,"750ml from The Good Beer Store, Chapel Hill (RIP). Got this one at the mega-discount closing sale, or else I might feel a wee bit ripped off. The ""black chocolate"" I would certainly count as a misnomer since, immediately in the nose, this beer reveals itself to be a very fruity Belgian strong with little in the way of the darker flavors. This bottle is from ca. 2003-2004, so I might have a different impression with a young bottle. But it’s super-heavily carbonated with a very active mouthfeel. Impressive hops remain, bringing out some cola and berry flavors (no heavy dark fruits for the most part). Not much change as the beer warms up. Alcohol is subdued for the most part, and the finish is syrupy sweet. Okay, but not hugely impressive.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Nice aroma, sweetish caramel with spices, some wood like oak and also sourish component like lemon or grapefruit. Flavor is very nice, but I still miss that expunged yeast. Its very well balanced between bitter and sweet, I expected to be more brut, more bitter. Offers whole range of flavors such as chocolate, caramel, plums, orange, other fruits, sugar, cola, spices etc. I also must say alcohol is not felt at all, I mean, at 12% its hidden so well I couldnt believe.

2331,"2008-05-05",4.3,"Picked up for a ridiculously cheap sale price of $10 at Greens, this 750 ml. Champagne style bottle was impressive even before opening.  The loud pop while pulling out the cork was quite a bit like opening a Champagne, but the Burgundy colored liquid with a large foamy head looked nothing like it.  It was an impressive looking beer nonetheless.  Id almost call is a cross between St. Bernardus Abt. 12 and Duvel.  The smell was quite a fruit barrage, led mainly by red apples, and followed by cherry and strawberry.  The taste was quite a bit like a Quadrupel but without a lot of the intense alcohol.  The fruits detected by the nose were here with some raisins thrown in.  Earthy and spicy hop presence was detectable.  Amazingly easy to drink for such a big beer with a creamy and dry texture that just glided down with each sip.  Felt quite a bit lighter in the mouth than it really was, which i think was quite an intentional effect.  Much better than the Brut Reserve in my opinion, as this one tries not to imitate something else, and is a better drink as a result.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Nice pour, a dark brown body topped off with a large fizzy beige head.  The first scent to reach my schnozz was a purple grape fruitiness followed by plums, dried out plums (prunes, if you must), toasted raisin bread with elderberry jam, dark malts, and a smattering of warm chocolate.  As hinted at afore, the body is light and highly, nigh superfluously carbonated.  The flavors a virtual flamora of a let-down, the main taste being sweet toasty dark malt.  Its soon joined by prunes (dried out plums, if you must), some burnt malt,,, but not a lot more.  I.e., the flavor doesnt match the expectations excited by the nose.

2331,"2007-12-24",3.2,"A very careful pour produces a seven finger thick, lightly browned, tan colored head that just keeps on growing; it overflows the top of my glass quite a bit.  The beer is a dark brown color, but shows a clear, concentrated red hue when held up to the light.   The aroma is quite inviting as I am inspecting the beer visually; richly caramelized bread notes, toasty grain and dark fruit aromas are all noticeable.  A closer inspection of the nose reveals additional aromatics of green apples, raisins, a green-spicy-herbal note, cocoa, and warming alcohol (enough so I can feel it at times in my nose).  This is interesting as it has the fruit character of a dry Belgian Tripel, but has some dusty, dark malt aromatics thrown in.  The aroma just doesnt have a depth to it that I would like though it is nice.

The beer has sat for some time in my glass with lots of time to lose the voluminous carbonation.  At this point it tastes quite creamy and a bit sweeter than I was expecting.  The beer was served at 50°F (10°C), so a bit warm for the amount of carbonation, but it is quite open in its flavor profile.  Sweet flavors of chocolate flavored caramel, rum soaked raisins, The beer finishes with an appetizing, fermentation derived, spiciness and a dark malt bitterness; flavors reminiscent of white pepper, ginger, clove, bitter chocolate and a touch of espresso all add to a slightly astringent, biting finish.  At times the alcohol is quite noticeable in the finish, really even hot, which is not unexpected in a beer with such a, relatively, light body and of this strength.  I like that this beer is so light for a beer of this strength.  If it wasnt for the alcohol, this would be dangerously drinkable.

This really needs to be a bit more tame on the alcohol front to be really good, sure you could chill the hell out of the beer and that would reduce the alcohol, but you would lose so much of the fruit, malt and spice character then.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The 2 years Ive had it in my refrigerator may have helped the clarity.  Spicy, peppery yeast is very strong.  Some anise notes, wood bark, and dusty and bready malts.  Also has hints of vanilla, chocolate, and dried pitted fruites (apricots) as well as some spicy alcohol notes.  Dry, well balanced to lightly bitter.  Bready malt is light and has hints of chocolate and herbal hops with just a hint of plum fruitiness.  Overall very subtle, maybe just a bit too subtle for me as bitterness and herbal hop win out in the dry lingering finish and aftertaste.  Highly carbonated, smooth, then dries out as it leaves the mouth from alcohol.  Lighter medium body, and warming alcohol.  Just a bit too bitter for my palate!

The aroma was earthy and lightly spicy through a dense deep tan head with caramel and fruit. The fruit presence was dark fruits of raisin and prune with a musty cellar presence. The effervescent beer was clear deep brown in the St. Bernardus chalice.  The flavor was deep and mysterious with dark fruits, raisins and prunes, and an earthy and lightly spicy flavor coming along for the ride. The spice presence contained a hint of cinnamon and a bit of clove with peppery leading the charge toward home. Also in the meld was a bit of smooth chocolate and a hint of roast. The body was medium full and the carbonation level was high leading to a creaminess on the palate.

The taste is shocking sweet and fruity at first before a dash of spice and even a bit of barnyard funk cleans up the palate. The alcohol luckily is not as strong as first noted on the nose. The finish is bittersweet and roasty, more like a truffle than a candy bar. Additionally, I discovered some smoked walnut like component which was neato.

2331,"2006-04-04",3.8,"Clear, brilliant red with nice, underlying brown hues.  Sweet, chocolatey aroma with an interesting blend of sweet caramel, nuts, cocoa powder, pilsner malt, noble hops, light cherry, vanilla, whole grains, plums, licorice, mild alcohol and some light roasted notes.  The body is light and fairly robust with a nice, prickly carbonation than really explodes in the mouth.  The flavor is sweet, but dry; a really perplexing profile that is hard to explain.  It starts sweet, promoting the dark fruit, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar and alcohol.  Toward the end, more tropical fruity esters come out and mix with the somewhat potent hop blend (grasses, light pine) producing a dry, warming finish.  This is a really interesting beer with a unique profile and complex interweavings of flavors and aromas.  Tasty and enjoyable, but something is a little off that kept my enjoyment lower than I would have expected.

The body is excellent with a light to medium feel in the mouth and tons of bubbles, the carbonation is very high.

The other flavors are more underlying. The alcohol is slightly present with an appropriate amount of warming but not overwhelming. The finish is quite dry and overall the beer is very drinkable and nice. I just feel the import version labeled ""Black Chocolate"" is not an appropriate name as you would expect alot more roasted and chocolatey character.

The Festivities:Diplomatic roastiness hires a few prunes, furtive cherries and looming black grapes to garnish the walls of the ballroom. Elegantly decorated with shining yet dry wooden floors and minty leaves, this will be the setting for a smooth bubble ballet where champagne alcohol will splash around like well-controlled confetti. All is done with finesse, silk gloves, platters of dark chocolate and a few sticks of licorice.

Had this not been the second-last bottle in a long line of sampled beers I might have had the palate to better appreciate this one. As it was my tongue still seemed to discern its quality. Great aromas of black/sour cherry, malt and hop, chocolate and then some barnyard gueuziness too. Nice. Big head atop a cloudy brown body. Sweet malts are offset slightly with the bitter chocolate until it becomes a touch medicinally alcoholic. I think the wonderful tingling mouthfeel actually woke my mouth up a little, and I would definitely want this one again with fresher senses.","Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA","beerhugger"

Solid-looking, opaque brown with thin but lasting, tan head. Perfume-like, saffron, tart, bitter chocolate flavour is initially malt dominated but a strong balancing bitterness emerges to counterpoint nicely. Touches of alcohol waft through the presentation without ever being dominant, though definitely warming. Crunchy mouthfeel - strong carbonation, fine-bubbled, engaging. More please!

2331,"2004-11-07",4.3,"26oz: Dark chocolate brown, superb beige head is eternally lasting, foamy, full of subtle lacing. Enormous chocolate malt aroma, predictably tart, yet somehow, they managed to find a fit between this and saison-like haystack scents. I found the balance to be remarkable for such an experiment, delicate herbal and flowery undertones together add tremendous depth. Rich bitter/tart chocolate, actually this may be tarter than it appears, yet I didnt find any annoyance in the marriage with the roastiness. No trace of alcohol in the aroma, remarkable feature by itself, but in such a complex blend, you dont get to spend much time thinking about that. Add to this a killer expanding in bubbles incredibly smooth foamy mouthfeel and you know where your 25$ went. I still think I prefer the regular Brut, but then again, I tend to prefer blonde Belgians to darker ones. I can recognize a killer recipe though and this one gave me a hard time to find places to give less than perfect scores! Astonishingly unique. A sipper that you couldnt drink too much of while being an incarnation of greatness! de Landtsheer can brew people, my rating may be a mess, but take that for granted.

Pours a moderately dark brown, somewhat like a porter.  But excellent lacing from a tan head that fights and kicks to stay alive.  Nose has faint unsweetened chocolate and dried dark fruit hints.  Flavor gives off a bit of a sharply bitter, drying sensation.  Quite a surprising chocolate beer, in that theres really not a whole lot of chocolate.  But I bet it would go excellently WITH chocolate, as it sort of posits an apparition of a cocoa presence.  Some big wood evident, and the dry yet round, full mouthfeel is very lovely.

Restrained brett character, herbal hops, butter rum, and firm malts. Extremely bright and vibrant. Fluffy and expansive, yet slightly pricklier than it is creamy on the tongue. Numbing alcohol underpins the zesty brett character and warms the innards. Harmonious flash of sweet malts and dry chocolate complement the  tight, toasty esters and bright tropical fruit display. Chocolate becomes creamier and more evident, midway, amid the soft peach esters and subtle chalky yeast tones. Gobs of underlying glazed, bready malt sweetness plays superbly with the understated chocolate and perfumey brett. Creamy chocolate texture coats the back of the palate before the extremely clean alcohol dries out the finish and highlights the subtle, yet well-defined brett note. Delayed fruity esters are sprinkled with eclaire pastry, butter rum, vanilla, and flowers, as the alcohol continues to warm the soul after the swallow. Remarkably composed throughout this humdinger of a brew. Stellar dessert brew, aperitif, or late evening sipper all by itself. How they crammed so may subtleties in such a huge beer is befuddling.
