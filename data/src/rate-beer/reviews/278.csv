Body is medium with no carbonation and mild warmth. Sticky in spots, too. Dry finish. Seems to bring out more of a liquor presence once it warms. Ends with more grains, fruit notes, soft wood and vanilla. Not a bad first experience!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"

278,"2007-05-28",3.4,"Bottle (served warm)... Clear, water-like appearance.  The aroma is of vanilla, ethanol and lemon peel. Sweet, citric flavor with moderate alcohol bitterness, light vanilla and a hint of almond. Full-bodied and mildly creamy with just a tingle of carbonation. Finishes dry and a tad boozy.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

278,"2007-01-16",2.7,"Sometimes I just get an itch in my ass to have some sake bombers w/ my girl.  This is the sake I usually get.  Its nothing really that special, although I found it to be a bit smoother than most in this price range.  When warm, gives off a nice rice aroma.","Arizona, USA","BrewManchu"

278,"2006-08-31",3.1,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2007 The first sake I ever drank came out of what appeared to be an empty marmalade jar covered with plastic wrap, held on with a rubber band.  It was the traditionally cheap stuff they sell at Japanese convenience stores, even if it looked like a drug addicts chamber pot.  Needless to say I didnt care for it.  It reminded me of the lab grade ethanol we used back in my early biology classes to sterilize our tools.  But it was all part of the culture, and one last attempt to embrace Japanese life after four months of residence in Osaka.  We also purchased a jar of plum sake which was more agreeable  especially the plum.  But that was all the sake I ever had, and it was nothing to write home about.  I recall looking into the calmly passing stream near my homestay house, watching the moon ripple in the urban water.  Between stomach rumblings I reflected deeply on the nature of sake and everything I had thought it would be.  Would I ever try it again? *grbbl*  Will all hard liquors taste as bad as that did? *blrrrgh*  Is there a wide gradient of quality in sake? *yirpp*  About one year later I drank a sake at a local Japanese restaurant called Kai.  It was much more flavorful and complex than its jarred counterpart, but still a bit strong for my sensitive taste buds.  Then this last summer I went on a cruise ship that had a sushi bar onboard.  The sushi was lackluster, but the sake was not.  At $1.25 per full tokkuri I couldnt resist, and thus I had the first few ochoko of sake that Id ever truly enjoy.  The gentleman behind the plastic bamboo showed me the bottle he was pouring from and it was the Sho Chiku Bai classic, served hot.  It was a strange colored semi-cloudy color, like clam juice, and went down very smoothly, leaving behind an oily after taste.  The alcohol burn was mostly suppressed overtaken by a fresh rice flavor that warmed the tongue, throat and stomach.  Somewhere in the middle of the flavor experience was a slight and untraceable sweetness.  The whole bundle was very moderate and enjoyable, if a bit fiery.  It definitely piques my interest for sake.  I never really thought it was an advanced drink, though certainly refined.  Further research is essential.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
278,"2006-08-23",2.6,"Good clear water color,light ruity scent with a mild alcohol showing.The flavor was lightly fruity a bit of some sweetness and the alcohol seemed to be fairly mild when cold but after warming a bit it became more pronounced.Its cheap but not all together bad eather.worth a try atleast once i guess.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
278,"2006-03-17",1.8,"Bottle  Pours a more-than-spectacular (as far as sake is concerned...) light, clear champagne.  Aroma is a rooty nail polish.  Flavor is sweet, flavored beef.  Weird, but it is.  Hints of faint nail polish abound.  Crazy.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
278,"2006-03-12",3.4,"Alright, Ill admit it, I dont know a damned thing about sake so Ill keep this short and sweet. This sake was cheap and it tasted good warm. I think Im becoming a sake lover over here. Goes best with a side of beer but then again, doesnt everything? This sake is clear and light with a few interesting notes of sweetness. I cant say exactly what it was that I tasted but I guess it was rice sugar. Tasted a bit like sushi rice. Overall, Ill drink this again, probably very often.","Sarasota, Florida, USA","DKlovesbeer"

Taste is mildly tasting of rice, slight alcohol sting yet not as powerful as liquor. Fairly clean and almost like drinking water.  My first Sake, I would drink this if I wanted to get blasted at the bar.  No heavy alcohol sting to it, yet goes down like water and is 16% by volume.  Too bad none of the bar carry this around me.","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","demitriustown"

The flavor is acidic with a bite of alcohol. I know this came from a cask of sake, but it tastes like it was warmed then cooled specifically at my request so they could continue to charge me $8 for about 3oz of this just because in Boise, its a novelty, people dont know theyre taking it from behind.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"

278,"2005-01-26",2.6,"first rated sake.  Clear pour, butter aroma.  Alcohol is also evident on the nose.  I am really not sure how to rate this...but Ill try.  Not as harsh as the last sake I tried at a japanese steak house.  This is sweet to start, definate alcohol burn in the middle, finishing kind of dusty.  Kind of a cross between a dry white wine and everclear.  I drank this at room temperature, maybe it would have been better warmed.  It is pleasant, however I am not sure how much of a fan of sake I am.","Chazy, New York, USA","ChazyRPh"

Aroma of alcohol, licorice and melted butter. Mouthfeel is slighlty oily and thick, not unpleasant. Flavor has some buttery notes with some alcohol notes. Strong finish, tastes actually stronger than the 16% ABV that is presents. Overall, not bad, would be good with some sushi.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
278,"2004-10-10",3.0,"Bottle.  Pours with a huge brown head.  Just kidding, Clear bodied with maybe a tint of yellow.  Aroma is ricey and ethanol.  Actually has a little body to it which suprises me.  A little oily,  alcohol doesnt overpower.","Alabama, USA","11026"
278,"2004-09-29",2.4,"My first sake...Well, this looks like a white wine.  Slightly pale yellow greenish watery color.  No bubbles.  Smells very vinous with some grainy hints.  Sour acidic nose.  Well, this is weird.  Start is quite watery and bland.  Middle is kind of buttery and thick.  Big time vinous notes in the middle.  Finishes with a boozy flavor.  I am uncertain if this is characteristic of most sakes or if this is a poor example.  Either way, this is much closer to a wine than a beer, and I can certainly understand why many people would rather not want them on ratebeer.  As for rating this, I dont know how the hell Im going to rate it.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
278,"2004-08-03",2.8,"Pours a clear, thick body.  Aroma is sweet, buttery, some plums, similar to the aroma of old wine.  Strong alcohol notes in the aroma.

It does spark my interest, though.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sethdude"
278,"2004-07-09",2.2,"A clear, vodka-like body with a milky rice and ethanol aroma.  Flavor has a bit more complexity, with milky/dirty earthy rice, soy, and ethanol predominating.

278,"2004-01-13",2.8,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2004 Had this at a nice wedding out-of-town.  The bottle was a huge 1.8 liter affair.  This sake had a fair amount of the oiliness and butteriness that I associate with such sakes (see my rating of Gekkeikan Cap Ace for an example).  The alcohol burn, as you would expect, was quite noticeable, and the glass gave off a strong aroma of jet fuel, but the oily mouthfeel helped to hide a lot of the alcohol.  I thought it was fairly sweet, as well, though I have no idea what its Sake Meter Value is.  Having rerated it several times, I can say that I enjoy this sake due to its pleasant mouthfeel and semi-hidden alcohol.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"

Slight alcohol burn but barely noticeable. Some bananas in the flavor with maybe some grapes. Its alright. I bet this is the low end stuff but I dont know. I kind of feel like I did when I joined Ratebeer, having almost no idea what Im talking about, a humbling experience this is!","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
