1857,"2016-07-14",3.6,"Bottle from Bierlinie. BB 25.03.2017. Pours translucent yellow with big off-white head and strong lace. Lovely sweet wheaty aroma, like some pastry product covered in caramel... So nice... Wheat wine. Hints of grassy pilsnery hops. Tastes not exactly as impressive but nice nontheless. Pale malts sweetness, continuing with grassy hoppy bitterness. Alcohol ideally hidden. Palate really soft, carbonation pleasantly mellow and body medium. An interesting and enjoyable brew.

1857,"2016-07-07",3.9,"Bottle best by Mar. 25, 2017, consumed Nov. 2015: Rich golden with light haze. Creamy wisp of head. Dynamically hoppy aroma of honeysuckle, peach marmalade, nectarine and grass clippings. Hints of sugarcane, alcohol, hay and pastrylike pils malt. Soft, tightly woven carbonation. Unfiltered and very natural in texture. Big punch of pale malt and marmaladelike, nearly resinous hops. Quite zesty, as well, adding to the complex hoppiness, with kumquat flavors atop a refined spiciness. A lemon meringue pie effect is a result of the adroitly mashed malt, which is clean, fluffy and detailed to the point of being pastry- and cake-like, and the captivatingly oil-saturated hoppiness. Finely detailed malt  generates a scratch of toast which helps keep the sugars in check, as does the mineralic water. Expressively hoppy finish oozes brightly flavorsome Hallertau nectar, soft floweriness and a continuation of supple oils elegantly dotted with hints of piecrust. Heller bock is an often underhopped style, but this pushes the envelope in that department, yet remains rather elegant and thus a joy to throw back. Pretty fun beer!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
