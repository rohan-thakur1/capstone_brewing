166,"2016-05-29",3.7,"Correct name according to the label is Must Kuld Kenya Porter - Coffee Edition, depicting a roasted coffee bean - still a bit suggestive, but not half as much as that of the regular version... Thick, creamy, dense, deep tan coloured head, dissolving gradually and eventually vanishing, very dark chestnut brown robe but only visible on the edges, otherwise black. Aroma of elderberry, damp forest floor, coffee grounds and cold remains of black coffee but not really the delicate fresh coffee bean fragrancy I was hoping for, cigar tobacco somewhere, bitter chocolate, iron but not in an industrial way, ripe blackberry, earthy beetroot, burnt toast, hints of salmiak, leather, bayleaf, oyster mushroom, fermenting tree leaves, balsamico. Soft blackberry- and blackcurrant-like, fruity sourishness in onset balanced with restrained fig and peach sweetishness, with a slight mushroom-like umami touch to it; spritzy carbonation, a bit minerally but no numbing effect, fortunately. Oily, slick mouthfeel, deeply nutty maltiness, bittersweet with again that dim sourishness on top it - must have something to do with those coffee beans. Finish continues this flavour whilst adding spicy, leafy hop bitterness, pleasantly coffeeish roasted barley bitterness underneath the added coffee beans, a faint kind of soft smokiness and some warming, rum-like alcohol; the spritzy carbonation makes things feel lighter than they probably are and adds a specific kind of sourishness to it but I wonder if a lower carbonation would not have been better suited for a coffee porter. Earthy, leathery, a tad overcarbonated and more Â’deeplyÂ’ sourish (without acidity) than expected: I had better coffee porters and stouts, but it is certainly a bit different and in all quite enjoyable. I liked the regular version more, though.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Lots and lots of foam. Aroma has mocha coffee, hayish tones, some truffles and hints of vanilla. Flavour has slightly bitter, cold coffee and some dark chocolate. Also slightly ashy. No CO2 on palate. Nice and smooth stuff still.","Tampere, FINLAND","laiti"
