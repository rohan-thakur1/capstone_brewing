2311,"2015-07-25",4.3,"Bottle, BB 16/10/22, so its almost 3 years old. Gushing a bit on opening but I was prepared for this to happen. Cool paper wrap around the bottle but Im a bit disappointed that it turned out to have a plastic cork instead of a real cork. Pours a brighter sort of orange body with a medium to small head. Aroma has plenty of brett and some light fruity hoppiness, later hints of light white wine are added. Everything is subtle and not too assertive. Taste has some bretty notes mixing with overripe oranges and a touch of white wine. Not getting any specific kind of NZ hops, I think the funkiness is overshadowing them at this point. Soft carbonation and semi-dry finish. Although I didnt have it fresh, I think ageing has mellowed the carbonation and sweetness, at least it feels this way. Very interesting beer - if you like brettanomyces then its a must try (but I dont think its currently available in any local shop here). However, it must be noted that the 2012 bottle of Orval I had as a warm up for this one was even more satisfying.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","thirstyrabbit"

2311,"2015-01-15",4.4,"(750ml bottle from Systembolaget - New Years Eve 2014 beer!) Pours a crystal clear medium copper with a big bubbly frothy white head that lingers well, with a wall of lace. Aroma beautifully vinous, driven by a core of white grape with cantaloupe and orange peel. Lots of funky, barnyardy and softly cheesy Brett, leather from oak, with hints of vanilla, lemon acidity and grass. Palate sweet and fruity at first with lots of white wine grape, peach, apricot, tangerine and some more exotic citrus, think I am missing something tropical. Moderate malt with slightly bready quality. White wine acidity builds from the middle on, Brett barnyard, a good amount of oak with vanilla. The latter two are dominant in the dry, bitter finish along with herbal, slightly spicy hops. Mouthfeel is medium full, creamy effervescent carb, perfect really. No booze heat. Phenomenal beer from Mikkeller, right up with their best stouts. There is so much going on here in all taste types. Super drinkable. Perhaps appeals to wine lovers most but the Belgian and funky sides are top notch as well. Cant say enough good things really.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

Taste is orange tart; citric juice. Scilian lemons. grapefruit; white grapes; Finnish rye bread; farmhouse funk and sour and tart overtones.

					It smells fruity and funky, with a dominate aroma of pears and apples present. That is mixed with some lemon zest, a clear brett presence, and some notion that this was aged in sauvignon blanc barrels, for sure.					
					
					
					
					The taste is complex, to say the least. I get a lot of citrus (grapefruit and lemon especially), some funk, a touch of wood as though the barrel itself is asserting itself, and a sharp acidic bite in the middle of the palate.					
					
					
					
					It finishes fairly clean and leaves a bit of that sharp tang on the tongue, along with the memory of pears and apples. 					
					
					
					
					The drinkability is fairly high, with the effervescence lending some help there. The funk lowers it out of the highly drinkable range, but it isnt enough of a serious detractor to lower it beyond a 4.					
					
					
					
					My main beef here is that it is really expensive for what youre getting, coming in at almost $1/oz, which is a bit too high in my opinion. Its certainly an interesting celebration beer, but I would probably steer someone looking for this type of beer toward a different Belgian strong.","Albany, New York, USA","justabeergeek"

Flavor is also sour with apricot and some grape fruit, the yeast, faint spices, grass and goose berries sum up to a quite dry palate. More and more little nyances are found from the aroma and flavor as the beer warms up a bit, but still the balance holds strong.

Sharp grapefruit nose that gives way to a bit of lemony white wine as it warms. Very intensely fruity from the hop. Bright sparkling body, very light for the abv, showing no trace of the alcohol anywhere. Grapefruit, white wine, lemons, and mineral dryness on the mid palate. Really fascinating and very drinkable.

So good.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2311,"2013-06-09",4.3,"A soft pour into my Teku glass produces a pale tan colored head that starts out two-fingers in height and leaves some nice lacing on the sides of the glass. The beer is a concentrated amber color that shows an absolutely gorgeous, bright, shining, brilliantly clear, amber hue when held up to the light. The nose, as expected, smells of tropical fruit and Brettanomyces funk; grassy, tropical, funky, mango, guava, peach syrup, funky tropical fruit notes that are quite floral. I really like how hoppy the nose is; lightly herbal and woody, but lots of bright, funky fruit character. As the beer warms up, nutty, spicy, woody oak notes round out the aroma.

Lightly sweet tasting, which is accentuated by the tropical fruit notes, but the finish is dry and funky with phenolic Brettanomyces notes that lean towards medicinal notes, definitely a bit musky, and perhaps a touch of plastic character. The beer is quite effervescent, this works well with the Brettanomyces flavors, and the lightly viscous body that makes this beer quite quaffable. The hop character contributes flavors of tropical fruit, lychee, guava, mango, lots of floral peach, kumquat marmalade, and Meyer lemon. The malt character here is quite light in relation to the other notes, but still does contribute flavors of English biscuit, hints of whole grain cracker, and a touch of caramelized malt character that is here just enough to support the vibrant hop character. The wood character plays a supporting role, it contributes soft notes of vanillin, a definite biting, spicy edge to the hop character and a finish that has some woodiness to it; this is only just so though, as the wood character is really quite restrained and works really well to support the hop and Brett character.

This is a quite good beer; the mix of bright, funky, fruity hops, and funky Brettanomyces character hits my funky / hoppy spot quite well. The hop character and the Brett achieve a really nice balance here; I am not sure of the age of this bottle, but the hops are still quite vibrant, and they balance very well with the Brett character at this moment in time. Somehow this is almost a guilty pleasure, certainly simple in its focus between hop and Brett, but this really is a mix of flavors that really appeal to me at this moment in time. This beer just keeps getting better and better with each pour, this is the first Brut beer that I have had that has actually been clear from the first pour to the last, and this is certainly the best Champagne style beer that I have had to date.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The beer is a honey orange color and has a thick, fizzy white head. Lasting retention and the tulip glass is coated with lacing.

2311,"2012-07-26",4.2,"Appearance: pours dark coppers with orange highlights  a visage of Fall foliage. Head fades clumpy, patchy, lacy, and bold. Swirls without lace but puffs up nicely.

Nose: grape musk rusticity of the barrels the beer was aged in. Rows of Sauvignon Blanc orchards basking in the sun while the earth dries below. Green grapes and ripe plums. Rye breads are spiced with peaches and apples and stewed in rye boozy deliciousness. Pink and white grapefruit  raw and unfettered without any added sugar. Candied ginger and cumin mingle amidst the oak, grapes, and grapefruit.

Palate: oak, spice, rye, peach, and apricot all as one and one as all. Long grapefruit finish with oak and whispers of grape musk and barnyard dust and funk. Biggest flavor profile in the middle. Lovely  screams for food. Silky and slightly sticky in the middle. Candied sugar along the edges.

Brett character was mild; hops lended it some more mustiness and gave it a pinecone / tree bark character as well, and speaking of bark, thats probably also how the barrels came through, muddled and lost in the clash of flavors.

2311,"2012-05-02",4.1,"Pours a dark golden orange color with a massive three finger white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Large chunks of soapy lacing left behind. 

Slightly earthy, funky aroma with a prominent musty brett character that nicely compliments the barrel presence and estery notes. Subtle barnyard character with some grass and hay along with toasted oak and light vinous fruit. Perfume with the sweetness of the white wine coming through. Smells really nice. 

Medium bodied with a nice balance of wine barrel, funky brett and light fruit. A decent amount of musty funk from the Brett but it isnt as strong as I expected. The wine barrel flavor is very strong with some dry toasted oak and sweet vinous fruit. The dryness of the oak goes very nicely with the dry brett. Theres a subtle bready yeast character that adds another dimension to the palate. Pretty sweet from the wine and faint heat toward the finish. ABV is well masked however, making this complex, well balanced beer easy to drink. One of the better Mikkeller beers Ive had in a while.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Smallish fading white head. Highly aromatic ale with a basket of tropical fruits and delicious juicy white grape touches that are attractive and contributing much complexity. Surprisingly tannic, tea-like hops do provide an interesting counterpoint where the grape would naturally call for acidity. I was going to stop describing it here but the nose is like no other I have smelled; very white vinous, typical gooseberry, dry flowers, light resinous pine, bretty funk, some, kiwi, and faint toasted vanilla. The flavor is similar with some buttery oak, faint toasted vanilla notes, similar fruity notes as the nose, dry floral and leaves, light pine, tart brett, and just a bit of funk; the bitterness is more than moderate as well as the acidity. The palate is moderate, less than lively, creamy, and bone dry. The finish is longer than expected, bone dry, slightly bitter, tart acidity, leafy notes, and a bit resinous.

White grapes blast through with green apple, lemon and grapefruit notes.  Followed by some light acidity that works with a ton of wet oak.  The brett presence is there but really works to complement the huge white grape and apple skin presence.  The oak is very well integrated as well.

How: Bottle 750ml, first batch brewed.  Consumed 1.5 after the beer release and 8.5 years before expiration date!!!
The look: Cloudy glowing golden-orange body topped by a persistent small off-white head
In long: Nose is unusual and intriguing, lots and lots of oaky wine barrel, leathery brett, dried orange peels, tropical fruits, horse blanket.  Taste is just as complex but is really not that vinous.  A lot of dried oak, dried pineaples, acidic white grapefruits, barnyard character, a slice of lemon zest, leather, a bit sandy, dry has a desert.  Very astringent finish that leaves the mouth sandy-dry.  Yet I feel that after 1.5 year that there is still some food for the brett in there and it could get even drier and more leathery.  Finish has a bitter grapefruits bitterness but I dont think it is hop related, I feel as if it is the oak and grapefruity brett joining forces to create a sharp bittterness.  No alcohol whatsoever, really hard to believe this is a 9% beer.  This is in-your-face brett and oak and yet the beer is never aggressive, I could even imagine myself downing many pints of this in a pub (and it is a 9% beer!).  The brett is not really funky here, it has a leathery and grapefruity character.  This is one of Mikkeller best creation.  I got myself a few bottles of this, but at $30 each, ouch!, this is nice but pricey treat.  But I can afford it, I saved a lot of money on car insurance by switching to Geico and then I saved even more by losing my licence because of a DUI.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2311,"2011-06-07",4.1,"750ml bottle, wrapped in beautiful black paper with a unique black cork.  Best by date is 09/15/2019.  Im guessing this is about 1.5 years old.  The pour yields a lightly hazy, medium honey-amber body.  A thick, spongy head of beige froth is steadfast, refusing to relinquish its stronghold, and leaving hard, clumpy rings of lace all over the glass.  Pretty brew, for sure.  The nose is quite enticing, showing smooth, malty notes of biscuit, cracker dough, attenuated caramel, and Quincys yeast rolls (if you grew up in the south in the  late 80s and early 90s, you know what this is).  To that add mildly buggy brett, peppery oak, and dry, vinous white grapes.  Champagne yeast is apparent and welcomed for its dryness.  Flavors follow suit, expertly balanced between doughy, softly caramelized bread malts and dry, zingy, seasoned oak slathered in dry white wine.  Notes of bitter grasses and perhaps some dried pineapple bring gorgeous hop notes into the fold.  The palate is substantive, lightly sweet at points, and nearly bone dry at others.  Persistent, fizzy carbonation is present throughout, clearing any residual sugars out expeditiously.  It drinks way too easy for a 9% beer.  Very good stuff.  This will undoubtedly continue to evolve over time, losing hop character but gaining dryness.  I quite like it exactly where it is.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Highly aromatic ale with a basket of tropical fruits and delicious juicy white grape touches that are attractive and contributing much complexity. Surprisingly tannic, tea-like hops do provide an interesting counterpoint where the grape would naturally call for acidity. A fair almond skin nuttiness coats the palate as flowery fruit salad expands together with the expansive bubbles. Brettanomyces remain well integrated, not all that developed aromatically, but ensuring a fair dryness that somehow does not thin the palate out. The 9% is not all that apparent. Very balanced and very original. Delicious stuff.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2311,"2010-09-24",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
White wine and tropical fruit evolve into hop resins and brettanomyces in this classy Belgian-style strong ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the cloudy deep amber.
-One of this beers admirable features is that both the barrel aging and brettanomyces are subtle, and thus very agreeable.
-Effervescence is expansive, which makes the flavor profile feel lighter.
-Earthy hop bitterness develops resinous angles.
-The tropical fruit character is akin to oranges at times.

2311,"2010-02-12",4.5,"Amber with a bubbly disappearing off-white head. Aroma of exotic fruit and brett. Smells very sweet in fact, but thanks to the leather and earth of the brett, the Nelson Sauvin hops dont come out as dominating as usual. The flavour is extraordinary. Dry with an almost mineral quality, yet with a lovely fruity sweetness. Malt, caramel, grapes, pineapple, grass, hay, earth. I get the champagne reference. Unique beer in all kinds of ways. This beer doesnt deserve to be a one-off new years beer!","Odense, DENMARK","Christian"

2311,"2009-12-31",3.5,"Bottle. High creamy thcik looking lasting off-white head. Slightly hazy light amber body6. Apple pear honey caramel hops aroma. Peach apple pear hops flavor with a soapyness that I do not quite fancy. Would have expected more carbonation or maybe even some kind of fizzyness for a new years beer. The carbonation is there but in moderation. Long bitter aftertaste. For a bit that is so expensive it is a bit of a disappointment.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Skinnyviking"
2311,"2009-12-31",4.4,"If one beer should be rated today this would be the one. The liquid New Year bomb from Mikkeller - and lets make it pretty clear - this one can easely replace the champagne at 12. In my opinion this is one of Mikkellers best beers this year (and he has released 40...!!).
The pour is deep straw yellow with a fantastic sparkling attitude. The head is huge and white white white. Bothe the body and the crown comes with a huge bubbles, something you dont normally see in beers.The aroma is very nvinoes, and you clearly sense the presents of the notes taken from the white wine casks. There a young grapes, some vinegar and citric notes.
The taste is really really nice with a sparkling and light palate. Notes of grapes, peaches white wine, wood, dirt and nicely balances hops. On top of that there is a smooth dryness in the end together with a bitter finish
I believe that this one should be served in a glas with a small surface - white-wine og champagne glass.
This is truely great work Mikkel. Thank you and happy new year.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","lassem"

2311,"2009-12-21",3.7,"Copper coloured with a dense white head. Aroma is mainly sweet and fruity hops with a light well knowned malt base, very straight forward. Flavour is more varied, starts with sweet fruity hops, a thin malt base that leads to a dry fun finish with very apparent notes of white whine blending well with the alcohol. A rather enjoyable beer that doesnt quite come together as a whole in the end with all the sweetness in the front and dryness in the end.","Malmö, SWEDEN","andersand"
