632,"2017-02-12",4.0,"Pours black with an average tan head. Aroma of malt, chocolate, and spice. Taste is roasted malt, dark chocolate, cinnamon, coffee, and lactose. Very good.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
632,"2017-02-10",3.7,"Bottle 65 cl. Pours thick and syrupy, opaque black with a tiny, light brown head. Sweet roast aroma, while I dont pick up any cinnamon. Rich body, richer than what youd expect in a 7% stout. The lactose doesnt really stand out as it most often does but appears well integrated in the beer as a whole. Everything is just well balanced, smooth, pleasant and very drinkable. 100217","","CloakedDagger"
632,"2017-01-09",3.6,"Bomber to snifter. Looks good; a slightly translucent very dark (almost dull black) cola with foamy beige head. Smells good too; cinnamon-forward, but well-balanced, alongside notes of milk chocolate and cocoa. Tastes like it smells, but with some salt as well, which interrupts the beer a bit IMO. Mouthfeel is medium full-bodied, semi-tart, and mildly bitter. Good, but smells better than it tastes. Id like to try it without the salt.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
632,"2017-01-02",4.0,"Sessionable but festive, with loads of cinnamon, brown sugar malt, cocoa and ginger bread flavors over a creamy texture. Hints of sea salt creep in as the cinnamon spice lingers long, with an edge of burnt marshmallow, black cherry and coconut. Warming but not overpowering.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
632,"2016-12-31",3.9,"Bottle shared at Todds. Big chocolate cinnamon taste with a medium mouthfeel. Nice overall.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
632,"2016-09-09",4.0,"Aroma - alcohol, toasted coconut, chocolate, and slight olive.
Appearance - the body is black, with a 1"" brown head. The head is tight and slowly settles into a 1/4"" slice.
Taste - rich toasted coconut, chocolate, marshmallow, sea salt, rich caramelized sugars, and slight bit of dark cherry.
Palate - full body, slick and thick feel, average carbonation, and a boozy sweet finish.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"
632,"2016-09-07",3.3,"Well, this is a cinnamon monster if every such a thing exists. It pours black w/ a frothy head. I am not sure if its autolysis or the sea salt but this does come off a little soy saucy. Its sweet but oddly light bodied. Theres a bunch of aged/oxidized character to it and its a little bit hot, esp. for 7%. This is drinkable and I do like the spices but there is a lot to be improved on in this beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
632,"2016-06-05",4.0,"Bottle sample in line for a bottle release from notes. Pours dark brown to black in color with a small beige head. The aroma and flavor have mild roasted malts, dark chocolate, lactose, caramel, some vanilla, cinnamon, flavors mix pretty well together, I would like to try this again, very drinkable.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
632,"2016-05-22",4.3,"Oh heck yea this is good. Milky cinnamon goodness. Its reminiscent of an Abraxas with less alcohol and lactose.  Subtle salt at the end.  Delicious. Thx HankDaStank!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","gregwilsonstl"
632,"2016-03-27",3.7,"Dark brown/black pour. Nose is a ton of cinnamon, some chocolate. Taste is cinnamon, chocolate, milky. Creamy mouthfeel.","","knickskicks"
632,"2016-02-24",4.8,"Late 2015 release. Bottle enjoyed in a MadTree pint glass on February 24, 2016.

Look - Almost no head. A little forms very late at the top. There is a very light ring. Head is tan and body is black oil. Even the edges are black. I am torn. I love a thick oily beer (especially with this abv) but no head at all.

Smell - Chocolate. Coffee. Cinnamon. 

Taste - Not artificial at all. Pepper. Cinnamon. Chocolate. Cinnamon. Vanilla. Just enough coffee with being overdone. 

Feel - Thick but smooth. Carbonation comes through enough in the feel (not in appearance). No alcohol. 

Overall - Better than Xocoveza, Neptune, Mexicanus, etc. I want to say it is better than Aun Mas Chili Jesus but so far apart with ABV. This is awesome for 7%.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","madelfonatree"
632,"2016-01-14",4.3,"Aromas of cinnamon and sea salt, then dark chocolate and plum/dark berries, lastly roasted malts. Taste is chocolate syrup, cinnamon, sea salt, plum/fig, and then roasted malts in the finish.","","Dorkenstein"

632,"2015-08-13",3.7,"22 oz bottle received via trade, thanks Chad! Black appearance with a lingering ring of tan foam. Aroma of chocolate, light salt, dark malts, mild roast, light earth and a bit of coffee. Similar flavor, adding some notes of cinnamon and lactose with a lingering salty, mild bittersweet finish.

632,"2015-05-18",4.0,"Bottle... This beer rocks! Pours new moon-black with a small, creamy, khaki head. The bouquet is a bold and luxuriant swirl of vanilla, toasted coconut, toasted pecans, cinnamon and chocolate crème. Full-bodied with a buttery mouthfeel and busy carbonation. The flavor presents dark chocolate, fudge, bittersweet roasted malts and cinnamon. Burnt, sticky, bittersweet finish. Another world class imperial stout from the good folks at 18th Street Brewery via BBB63!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
632,"2015-05-02",4.0,"Bottle from flandersned-thanks, Steve! Pours thick and black with a coffee crema colored rim. Nose is cinnamon, dark and milk chocolate. Rich, and full bodied, with creamy sweetness, and nice cinnamon, vanilla, and chocolate elements. Not cloying in any way, and well done. Didnt get the salt but wasnt looking for it. Reminded me a lot of Abraxas but without the chili, and not the same slick viscosity.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"

Smooth, but with a slightly lingering finish that left creamy residue. I had more than few servings of this one.","New York, USA","tbearchunger"
