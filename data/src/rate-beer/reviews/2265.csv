Pours a clear, dark brown color with a small, stable beige head.

Smells of toasty spices, peaty earth and dried figs, topped off by milk chocolate. Has some earthy malts and a good anount of herbal licorice to it, balancing the well pronounced sweetness.

Drinks very soft, silk, with just a very subtle carbonation, soothing the beers bigger body, which produces an immense spectrum of different flavors.

Tastes of toasted walnuts, earth and a perfectly evolving sweetness from this rustic, yet smooth foundation. Brings some dried cherries to the palate, dusty bakers chocolate, black pepper hull, anise and rock sugar to round out the balance in this. Its midpalate is increadibly creamy with a taste defining rusty maltiness, together with peppery spices. Finishes with long lasting caramel and a late, subtle dryness, ranging from herbal to earthy coffee, wrapped up by old oak and cardamom.

Tonen van karamel en butterscotch, gedroogd fruit, rozijnen, vijgen en pruimen, zachte specerijen als kaneel en kardemom, en wijnachtige toetsen van aarde en leer. Verder een interessante bitterheid van kruidige hopsoorten. Er zijn toch boven mijn verwachting behoorlijke verschillen met de Pannepot. Deze Pannepeut neigt meer naar een quadrupel, en is lichter van kleur en subtieler van smaak, terwijl de Pannepot meer stout achtige tonen heeft. De afdronk is lang kruidig en aangenaam bitter.

No head.

Nose is full of nutmeg, stewed prunes, sweet dates and candied fruit. There is also a hint of what is described as gula melaka which is a thick brown sugary syrup made from coconut flowers. Very pleasingly sweet with a unctuous fragrance. charming without being cloying.

First mouthful is lightly carbonated so you dont get too much tongue on the first kiss. This is a surprisingly balanced strong ale with just enough alcoholic heft and a strong malty back for the heavy lifting. There are constant reminders that this is a strong ale. Sipping this is like having a 250lb, heavily-muscled, slightly dusty carpenter smelling of tobacco and old leather edging you out of your spot at the bar, daring you to say something.

Yellowish beige, thick, creamy head, pretty stable in relation to the ABV. Dark bronze colour, orangey, hazy. Powerful fruitiness in the nose, rich maltiness too with a subtle sourish accent, complex, gingerbread, blackcurrant, port wine, honey, cloves, wine vinegar, stewed pear, strawberry, candi syrup, chocolate bars. Candi and fruity sweetness in the onset, medium carbo, light sourishness, soft and mellow, deeply malty middle phase, finishing with drying coriander and aromatic hops as well as warming alcohol which is a bit more obvious here than in the regular Pannepot and even a little bit astringent. Just a little bit below the regular but still a great ale.  The latest editions seem to have something of a light tartness to them; I found the 2010 vintage, tasted at 5 years of age, better in having a more delicate balance between sweet and sourish.

2265,"2014-08-08",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 8, 2014 Pannepeut 2010 - Az előzőleg kóstolt darabhoz, a Pannepot nevű változathoz kötődő rokoni szálak megléte a napnál is világosabb, tetten érhetők a küllemén kívüli egyéb jellegzetességeiben is, mint utóbb kiderül. Eltérésként mutatkozik egy, a főzőmester által kinyilvánított, tipológiabeli különbség, amennyiben ezt a verziót quadrupelként, illetve trappista jellegű italként tarthatjuk számon. Színe, valamint a habképződés mértéke és módja ismerősen hat, fény felé tartva sejtelmes, rubinvörös árnyalatokat csillant meg, melyekre krémes, bézs színű lepel telepszik. Súlyos, markáns aromái vészjóslóan komoly, szájbarágós mondanivalóról árulkodnak, később azonban ismét szembesülnünk kell vele, hogy az illatok alapján levont következtetés hitelessége ez esetben is csupán illúzió volt. Kávés, intenzíven pörkölt karaktere van, melyre egy meglehetősen nehéznek tűnő, rumos-diós jelleg épül, a fekete gyümölcsök cukortartalmával és egy élesztős vonulattal. Belekóstolva aztán meglepődve tapasztalhatjuk, hogy amennyiben egy szirupszerű, vastag és szövevényes testre készültünk, némiképp elszámítottuk magunkat. Finom és árnyalt zamatok, cseresznyelé és meggybefőtt, krémes csokoládé, telt ízű maláta könnyed, mégis megnyerő játékának lehetünk részesei, a várt és sok helyen megénekelt cukorszirupos élmény azonban elmarad. Azzal, hogy ezt a gazdag és komplex aromahalmazt ilyen finom eleganciával és lehengerlő felsőbbrendűséggel, mégis túlzásoktól és rohamszerű előretöréstől mentesen, mintegy elemi természetességgel hozza, engem legalábbis teljes mértékben meggyőzött. Azt azonban, hogy a két típus közül melyiket tartom kiválóbbnak, magam sem tudom eldönteni, mind a kettő valódi különlegesség, és megérdemelten örvend ekkora népszerűségnek.

Pannepeut 2013 - Aszalt gyümölcsös, szilvabefőttes, likőrös alkoholosságot sugárzó aromái vehemensen törnek elő a vöröses beütésű, gesztenyebarna árnyalatú főzet vékonyka, ám krémes, bézs színű habja alól. Utánozhatatlan, egyszersmind megunhatatlan illataiban minden benne van, amit egy tartalmas sörtől várhat az ember, különösen, ha az illető nem veti meg az efféle csemegeszerűen édes, komplex zamatokat. Lágyan prökölt kávé, enyhe medvecukros vonulat egyensúlyozza ki a bonbonos szerkezetet, tarkasága akár a kolibrié. Egy pár kör után, melyet forgatása során a poharában tesz meg, olajos lenyomata borhoz hasonló testről árulkodik, tapasztalataink alapján pedig tudjuk, íze sem áll messze attól. Összetettség dolgában mindenesetre nem kell szégyenkeznie, befőttszerű, konyakmeggyes jegyei nem nélkülözik az étcsokoládés, rumos kávés, diós hangulatokat, tehát a trappista quadrupeles jellemvonásokat sem, az alkohol fátyola pedig minduntalan sejtelmesen takarja be a megfejthetetlenül gazdag kompozíciót. Magasztos hangvételű főzet, minden megnyilvánulásában egyedi, elegáns és kiismerhetetlen.","HUNGARY","adster"

Man får jo indtrykket af at sætte et dovent glas øl for munden, når man kigger på brygget, men misforstå det ikke: øllet har kulsyre - det er blot perfekt afstemt til denne øl (som Struise iøvrigt har for vane at gøre ved alle deres øl). 
Vil gerne indrømme min beundring for Struise bryggerne og ej heller her bliver man skuffet. Old Monk's Ale er et dejligt glas øl!

Looks a rich, deep brown colour with a ruby red hue in strong light: on top a thin beige covering and collar.

The nose is a delight: sweet malt drenched dark fruits fill the air around the glass and make you want to dive in.

Dive in I did: the taste is divine: I love sweet malty brews and this fit completely into my style. Gorgeous flavours of spices, yeast and those sweet dark fruits blend together giving a wonderfully tasting beer that belies the 10% ABV it stacks.

Le note olfattive che si distinguono sono quelle maltate, speziate, alcoliche, fruttate (frutta secca, fichi) Al palato le cose iniziano a cambiare. Al beershop mi hanno detto che la Pannepeut e la Pannepot sono la stessa birra ma con etichettatura diversa. Non è così. Al palato la Pannepeut è complessa si, ma si beve con un pò più di facilità. Si può mandare giù una sorsata più sostanziosa per intenderci. Risulta anche meno densa di sapori della Pannepot Reserva 2007. Resta tuttavia una birra di incredibile livello qualitativo. Il palato, differenze a parte, è caratterizzato da un ingresso vellutato, denso, con note maltate. Lalcol la riscalda e la rende suadente. Il gusto è complesso (cioccolata al latte, mandorle, fichi, malto, etc). La chiusura viene pulita da una piacevole e lieve luppolatura. Buonissima.","ITALY","IlBevitorediLA"

Poured a murky brown with almost no head, but many suspended bubbles.  Even leaving a quarter inch of beer in the bottle, there was significant floating suspended yeast.

Pours a murky, dirty looking coffee color. Head is tan and one finger tall. Lots of sediment floating around. Head retention is good and lacing is very good.

Smell is of roasted nuts, sugar cookies, and spice like ginger, allspice or nutmeg. Hops arent detected and smell of alcohol lingers through out. 

First taste Im getting is of a spiced rum cake or maybe some pancakes with maple syrup drizzled on top. Notes of candied fruit or nuts are also there. As typical to the style, no hops detected and alcohol is present but not overpowering. 

Mouthfeel is alittle thinner than I was expecting. Its not watery but I was hoping for a more syrupy texture. Head adds some thickness to body and beer is well carbonated. 

Overall this beer was good, not the best in its style but drinkable. Body was slightly too thin for the style in my opinion, flavors were just off the mark from being exceptional. Liked the beer but dont think Id pay another 8 bucks for it","Colorado, USA","Angelmonster"

Drinks warm, warmer than even the 10% on the label. Mouthfeel is smooth and body is relatively full. Flavor is sweet cherries and stewed apples, decidedly less complex than the aroma, which was very inviting. Candi is present. Finishes with twigs. Good balance, but less complex than I hoped. If only it tasted as good as it smells, Id probably have two perfect ratings, and both would be from De Struise. Outstanding beer, nonetheless.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
2265,"2011-06-07",3.6,".33 L bottle. 2007 vintage. 
 
APPEARANCE: Dark brown. Hues of ruby. Opaque. Healthy dose of sediment. 
 
Head is 1-2 fingers, uniform, light khaki, short duration. 
 
 
AROMA: Dark roasted malt, red currant, tangy red stone fruit, faint vinous character, coffee, chocolate. 
 
TASTE: Almost like an imperial Abbey dubbel. Plentiful dried dark fruit such as dates, light prunes, and even some dried blueberry-like character. Belgian yeast, lightly toasted malts, dark bready notes with faint rye character, dark Belgian candi, nutty, caramel, coconut.
 
Roast bitterness (complimented by a hint of tangy vinous character) is especially evident on finish. 
 
 
MOUTH FEEL: Higher side of medium body. Semi dry. Slightly viscous. Semi sweet (complimented by subtle vinous undertones), yet far from cloying. Light alcohol warmth. 
 
 
OVERALL: Interesting tangy red stone fruit notes on nose. Became more enjoyable as it warmed up. Definite differences between nose and palate.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"

Pours a light copper color with a good, though slightly short-lasting, white head. Good spotty lacing on the sides of the glass and a collar throughout. The nose strikes me immediately as being pretty light on the dark fruits, with more caramel and malt coming through. Aside from that, a spicy character takes over and really sends a few good notes. Light hops there as well. Different, but quite nice. The flavor is along the same lines--nice light spice with some bready malt and light fruits. Hoppy character is there as well, and then combines quite well with the spiciness to form a beautiful finish. Medium body. Nicely done, Struise.

Oppened in the kitchen, and my glass was in the living room. I should have foreseen the problem:(
Bottle in mouth I run for the glass, and pour a small amount just enough to rinse out Southern Tier 2xIPA, and still Pannepøt runs out of the bottle. 
Trying to sip both the bottle and the glass, I manage to pour a glass of a very fine looking beer without to much of a mess.
It is murky brown with off-white lasting head. It does look inviting.
Nose is very malty dominated by dried fruit and moscovado sugar.
Slightly sour, high carbonation and alcohol can be noticed, but then it is 10% and it is not too present.

2265,"2009-10-06",4.2,"Bottled 2007. The structure of the aroma reminds of excellent wine or champagne. Dark cherry fruitiness with notes of herbs and bitter chocolate underneath. Very malty and complex. Pours dark brown with a small, off-white rim. The flavour is again sweet malty, the spicing is very evident, resulting in a cuvée of flowery and herbal flavours. There are slightly smokey and roasty components, but a fine caramel maltiness is the most prominent. Lovely bittersweet finish. Mouthfilling, with a bit too much residual sweetness for my liking - otherwise a damn good beer.","AUSTRIA","danielst"

2265,"2009-07-09",3.9,"Original review date 5/6/2008...2006 vintage for the Danes into Cab glass

Beautiful dark chestnut body with ample carbonation. Chewy, maple walnut ice cream-colored head dissipates quickly and exhibits sufficient lacing.

Mildly soapy hop presence - brown sugar cinnamon with ginger and sarsparilla - a little tin presence when cold.

Creamy - almost like ice cream with strong spice profile of cinnamon, ginger root, sarsparilla in the chewy braised-like malt. Tough to shake the tinniness but after a while warming it starts to dissipate. Slight smoke and wood chips emerge with warmth.

Extremely hearty and chewy mouthfeel...like a warm caramel apple sundae. Tight grip, almost tangy.

Overall very enjoyable parts of the offering but they arent necessarily synced up with each other as well as would be desired; strong effort nonetheless.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

The flavor is similar to the aroma with malt, raisins, prunes, molasses, and caramel along with just a hint of brown sugar.  Smooth and silky on the palate while at the same time lightly effervescent with ever-so-tiny bubbles that creates a liveliness that I am enjoying very much.

2265,"2009-04-26",3.7,"11.2oz bottle. Pours a murky, deep brown-garnet colored body with bits of particulate floating around. Finger-width, dirty tan, soapy head that leaves a swirling surface of foam and a soapy lacing. Has a very atmospheric-like aroma to it. Light Belgian spicing and booze mixed with some brown sugar, fruit cake, and caramels. Flavor is a little more rich than the aroma hints at. Moderate malty sweetness and a good amount of Belgian spicing and yeasts. Moderate caramels and toffees along with some more of that fruit cake flavor initially. Mostly dark fruits such as prunes and dates. The mild spicing comes in during the middle and becomes more noticeable in the finish. The finish is where the complexity of this becomes evident. Brown sugar, toasted toffee, and a hint of dark chocolate accompany the spices and dry, malty finish. Nice lingering spicy malt taste. Palate is medium bodied and hides the 10% very well. The booze just barely comes through in the finish and comparably lighter than the aroma. Overall, a nice tasting beer that grew on me more and more. Not as exceptional as some people have scored this, but a nice beer nonetheless.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

This really pushes through with some astounding brown character. Layered on top is a delicate spicy yeast note that puts out some pear brandy, plum sauce, and light pineapple on top. Amazing and enticing. Pours in an eclectic paler teak and sienna, with a range of colors, and a silky lacing in tan. Flavor is just as flavor-powerful and rich as the nose, but in different ways. It throws off browned sugars, graced lightly with molasses, in a whole bevy of baked goods, from oatmeal cookies to brownies. Theres a really depth and richness to the malt and sugar profile of this beer. Alcohol deftly concealed, but adding. This is a little sweeter than I expected, but the bright, yellow-colored fruit flavor that sits on top of the malt, adding complexity in banana, passionfruit, and coconut makes this delightful and rounded on so many levels.

How: Bottle 330ml.  Vintage 2006.  Consumed when over 1 year of age.  Side by side with regular Pannepot (same vintage).  Bottle given to me by Drewbeerme, thanks a lot Andrew.
The look: Many small particles in a cloudy brown body topped by a small beige head
In long: Rather than describe it the beer Ill compare it to the regular Pannepot that we all know and love (both were vintage 2006).  The Pannepøt has a much stronger liquorice candy and barley candy flavour.  The fruity notes of the regular Pannepot are more like sweet fruits concentrate in the Pannepøt.  Feels a lot more sweet than the regular Pannepot.  Similar spicy nature, similar earthy note but the nice floral character of the regular Pannepot feel turns into something that taste like sucking on tulip petals in the Pannepøt.  Put another label on it and I wouldnt complain but I was rather disappointed by the Pannepøt it is a pretty nice beer but it is a far cry from the regular Pannepot.  Commercial description above says ""is produced to express the brewers gratitude to all the Danish beer amateurs"".  No surprise it made its way to North-America, they must have sold like 4 bottles total of this beer to the 40 Danish ratebeerians.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The flavor begins with dark fruits, plums and raisins, along with some very mild licorice. This is complimented by a vanilla character that ties everything together very nicely. About midway through, an awesome maple candy quality comes into the picture and makes for a very long, very sweet finish. The mouthfeel is like velvet.

2265,"2008-11-30",4.1,"20081130  11.2oz bottle and I forget where I got it but it wasn’t local.  Maybe Capone’s.  Nearly opaque dark maple syrup color with medium, lasting, even head of uniformly sized medium foam.  Aroma is rich, spicy (savory), and seasonal with notes of nuts, roasted squash, plump raisin, vanilla, and rum.  With the chill and onset of winter, this beer is a fine choice on a dreary day.  Flavor is an interesting amalgam of standard Belgie strong ale flavors but also some sweet American influence, with temp perhaps a touch too sweet, and a long savory finish again reminding of caramelized roasted foods.  Medium-full palate is fully appropriate and strong alcohol is mostly unnoticed except for the nice buzz.  Good beer.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
2265,"2008-11-20",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2009 2006 vintage. Another Struise gusher. Usual tactic of easing the cap off and standing it in a Hoey glass to catch the lava flow of suds. Pours mahogany with a blossoming yellow-beige head; unearthly foam sculptures collapsing to a slick in minutes, in a variety of glasses. Aroma up-the-nose liquorice stick, cinder toffee, yeast extract, sweet (straw)berryish fruits, plum. Mouth creamy, sticky, slightly burnt once its really been standing a whilebrazen liquorice, candi sugar, faint cocoa. Not really getting any obvious spicing. Bit of vanilla, stone fruit, prune in the aftertaste. Roasted malt traces, maybe. Alcohol nicely buried by sugar and liquorice. Sweetish and unsubtle, touch of peaty malt. Pretty standard, liquorice-driven Dubbel-like flavours turned up a notch. Missing the bite of hops or yeast, but hugely drinkable. Nice beer. 747315 
(Re-rate). 2006 again, to take the taste of a Leroy Stout away. Robustly malt-accented aroma evoking Germany more than Belgium with noseful of sticky raisin, demerara, licorice and malt loaf. Warm of booze humming softly with fruit loaf and muscovado; liquorice detectable but alcohol (flavours) not. Wholesome malty sipper mellowing with age into a murderously sessionable hybrid of dubbel and doppelbock. At 10%. The devils.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

However, I found the beer at Beer Mania, and real brewers or not, I found both this at the Old Fisherman’s Ale to be quite good beers.

Poured a dark brown after exploding out of the bottle onto the counter and floor.  Minimal head despite the overcarbonation.  Aroma was complex - malty, sweet, with dried fruit notes and lots of slightly roasty maltiness accented by cherry notes.  Full mouthfeel hit me first - you pucker a bit like a red wine full of tannins - the flavor is some coffee and dried fruit.  I thought it tasted a bit like apricots and dried cherries.  Delicious.

There’s a little bit of cola flavor in there as well on top of a roasted malt base with some caramel tones.  The mourhfeel is medium bodied with a little less carbonation than the original.

Moves to sugared mocha latte for a second before roast and alcohol break things up a bit. Sweet caramel malt. Alcohol soaked prunes come and go in the middle.

2265,"2008-07-05",3.7,"Bottle. Had it right after a Pannepot, and hardly compares outside of the name. Dark fruits abound, spices, alcohol, pretty average body for a Belgian Strong.

Dark figs and candied dates with definite sweet sugar cane.  The flavor is yeasty and malty.  Similar to a nice Abbel Dubbel, but this has a subtle charred malt among the plantains and brown sugar.

2265,"2008-05-28",3.6,"2006 vintage 11.2 oz. bottle  (purchased at Keg Liquors in southern Indiana: Clarksville) into sniffer with most of bottle conditioning yeast left behind.  First thing first, I quickly bought this thinking it was the PannepOt; oh well, lets give it a try.  Pours dark brown amberish with a nice off-white head.  The head stunned me because it was shaping up to be a normal big puffy beer head, but then it started fizzling loudly like a sodas, receding pretty quickly. Very typical sweet Belgian aroma with hints of cherries and sugar.  Flavor includes sweet malts with cherries (somewhat metallic altogether) with a grain flavored finish.  There seems to be much more complexity on the finish than the initial flavor.  The alcohol is hidden very well.  It is heavy on the stomach but soft, a bit fizzy, and medium to light bodied on the palate.  Overall: I tend not to be a Belgian man due to the general sweetness of the style, but this is quite pleasurable; I wouldnt have more than one in a sitting though, because this bitch is still a bit too sweet for my taste; worth a try though, although I wouldnt buy it again at 7-8 dollars per single.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

A sudsy wash mostly rejoins the body, with scant lines of lacing remaining behind.  The aroma shows tons of candy sugar, caramel, fig and dark spice.  A wave of tannic fruit, including overly ripe red apples, lends depth and a certain sourness to the nose.  Flavors are basically the same, with caramel covered figs and apples showing quite sweet.  A touch of spicy, floral hops lend some balance, though this one still falls well short of the median on the bitterness scale.  Medium-full and creamy, the body slides down incredibly easily, leaving a lingering sweet and sour coating on the tongue.

The beer was very malty and had a fairly high degree of residual sweetness. The beer was mostly clean, highlighting the malts over all else. There were some esters around mid-palate: soft and dark fruit and very subtle notes of tart fruit and spice. The finish had a low degree of bitterness with a full, caramel malt finish. The mouthfeel was thick, but velvety and decadent - not syrupy and cloying. There was a decent bit of carbonation - which was surprising considering how little head poured up.

I was a little hesitant to give it a shot because I saw ""Belgian Ale"" and ""brewed with spices"" and kind of got worried, as Im not too keen on either.

Very sharp and nice spicey notes that never dominate. Almost like a brown ale with bite. The aroma is somewhat weak, but I think it was meant to be subtle, which it achieved.

2265,"2008-03-11",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 13, 2010 [Bottle] (06 Im almost positive) Pours murky mahogany with a thin fine beige head.  Does smell a bit like sherry, but the aroma isnt very strong comparatively and Im getting a little bit of metallic.  Rich sweet molasses and very nutty.  I didnt know if I could tell the difference, but this seems very much more straight forward than Pannepot and more vacant in body.   I also get a little metallic aftertaste from this.  This is still really really good stuff, but after having first tried the Pannepot....=p  This stuff mellows a bit after 15 minutes or so of air.

Aroma is straight Westy yeast, super plummy, sherry soaked tea cake, fruity molasses, uh..yup.  Flavor follows, very plummy, westy yeast, seems more attenuated than before, less driven by the molasses flavor and more by the plummy yeast, the sherry soaked cake flavor is 2nd to the yeast character, nice plummy bitterness towards the finish, nice and fresh, bit of warming alcohol on the finish.  Ive got a bottle of 06 left I should open soon to compare, bit of cola towards the finish.  Body is just a bit milky but other than that nicely attenuated with nice carbonation.  Ill leave the score, except maybe a 9 on aroma instead of flavor.  Mmm opened up quite a bit more, both aroma and flavor, intense rum cake and sherry flavors, rich but well attenuated, raisiny.   . . . . . [2006 bottle that Ive hate since early 08) C-C-BB.  Pours a dark milkdud color, richly syrupy brown with a frothy light tan head... yummy, this one gets a 5! Maybe the 07 as described above is actually closer to the 06 than I remember.  The aroma on this is loaded with sherry.... basically smells just like sherry, o that is insane.... no real off putting oxidation notes, loads of vanilla that I never remembered, and birch... smells just like birch, maybe more birch than sherry.  Flavor is way less plummy (bitter) than the 07 and has a smoother brown sugar and birch like flavor, seems to have less depth than it once did, more homogenized sugary goodness now, and flavor has some more of those typical oxidizing malt flavors that the aroma seems to be missing.  Big soda carbonation, bit sticky viscous, not as sophisticated in palate as I remember.  Very tasty and aged extremely well... o I wish I could go back and taste this 2 years ago again.  9.5.9.4.17 (quite delicious as it finally reached room temp and opened up.... endless.. endless amounts of dates, bread pudding, sweetness tapered off as well... fantastic.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

This is the only release of the Pannepot series that I have yet to try excepting the recent Grand Reserva (which I will have to track down when it hits the states).  Of the three I found this the best by the slimmest of margins.  Whereas the others are definite 3.9s this one is more like a 3.95.  Hopefully Ill be able to find another bottle to restock the cellar for a special occasion.
Aroma / Appearance - A one finger dirty white head rests on top of a sticky chocolate brown body.  There is evidence of carbonation but it is not very lively.  The smell of gingersnap cookies, caramel and molasses filled the area around my glass.  The difference between this and regular Pannepot seems to be the slightly more sweet character.
Flavor / Palate - A creamy coffeelike mouthfeel coats the tongue with chocolate and maple syrup.  Next comes molasses and cherry liquor on a wave of woodiness.  The alcohol is evident in a way that compliments everything.  The warming slightly sweet finish makes this an excellent release.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The aroma came across as quite mild in body, but higher in spices.. with lots of vanilla, honey, citrus and caramel.

2265,"2008-01-10",3.5,"2006 bottling: Dark mahogany. Thin but creamy eggshell head persists nicely with each sip. Cola, licorice, coriander, rum-splashed raisins, and hints of caramelized fruitcake comprise the solid but uninteresting nose. Lots of fruity esters as well. Teasing scent of cinnamon and cocoa. Mild note of doughy yeast. Tight and soft carbonation. Well-rounded acidity is gently embraced by a woody bite of licorice, chewy cola- and rum-like sugars, and a surge of alcohol which provides immediate warmth. Understated dryish maltiness accentuates the earthy spices. Well-integrated flash of aniseed (ester or actual spice?) comes and goes as its soon engulfed by plump raisiny esters. Sufficient sweep of dryness pleasingly cleanses the palate, though the core is a bit hollow and primarily dominated by a flabby fruitiness which fails to get much assistance from the malt. A dab of caramelized malt is faintly perceptible, and does add some structure to the body, but a liberal dose of Pilsner malt would better balance and complement the sweetness. As a result, it comes off as being fairly shallow. That said, the spices and esters are very poignant and bright. Finishes juicily fruity and soft, with a dusting of caramelized and strawlike malt which lurk beneath notes of rum, raisins, and hints of Juicy Fruit gum. Some minor adjustments are all this needs in order to be superb.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

2265,"2007-12-01",4.1,"11.2oz bottle.  Pours reddish brown with significant red hues when held up against the light.  The head and visible carbonation on this one are drastically less than what Ive experienced in all my bottles of the regular version.  Head retention is also much less in this one, the off white head quickly diminishing to some foamy swirls right on top of the liquid.  Aroma is quite nice and similar to its brother - raisins and other dark fruits, candy, sugar, vanilla,  the idiosyncratic blue cheese, a tiny dab of chocolate.  Wonderfully complex smell.  Soft mouthfeel reveals flavors of sweet fruits and that same sugared coffee aftertaste of Pannepot.  Its hard not to keep comparing this to the other version but what do you expect.  Besides the appearance I cannot distinguish this much from my memory of the original, though Im sure a side by side comparison would reveal a lot more.  Still this is world class.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

2265,"2007-11-19",4.1,"2006 bottle.  Really nice malty aroma, sweet with overly ripe fruits and a bit of candy sugar and sour cherry.  Caramel and raisin and a bit of christmas cake, and more apparent alcohol than the original version.  Pours a near-opaque red-brown with a scant beige head.  Taste is rich and sweet but never cloying, lightly bitter and faintly sour, more to round off than anything.  Medium, quaffable body (but who would want to?) with notes of an herbal, slightly medicinal brown sugar, and tea-ish leaf extract.  Spruce?  Would be excellent in candy block form.  Smooth, densely malty feel, aftertaste is dry and slightly herbal with a flash of something reminiscent of juniper.  Spicing is, on the whole, very subtle and refined.  In contradistinction to the original waft (and even in the main whiff it had diminished), the alcohol is nowhere to be found in the mouth - perfect integration!  Stylish and classy, but not up to the standard set by the original - what exactly is the difference in Danish taste thats being brewed to?","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Compared to normal pannepot, not near as sweet, and definitely has a hop note which is not noticed in the regular. A bitter, kind of drying aftertaste and aroma. Not as refined, but sitll very enjoyable.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

Comments: I presume the most helpful rating is a comparison with the regular version. This felt, if possible, perhaps even sweeter, in a juicy way, perhaps an impression caused by the lesser presence of darker malts, toasty and bordering roasty which have a balancing effect in Pannepot. It also feels less long and dries out quicker. Excellent, but not the decadent treat it seems.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Opens with a lot of CO2. No gushing. The pour is a challenge with all of the CO2. Huge lasting white frothy head. The aroma is huge caramel backed by vinous sherry notes, dark fruits, and barnyard character. A rich lush body that is made more drinkable by the high level of CO2. The flavors are instantly sweet caramelized malt and dark cabernet. The wild yeast characters of the beer make the vinous character come out in full force. The finish is sweet and satisfying with a ever so light dryness once the fluid has left the mouth. A great Belgian dark ale.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"

I opened this one to celebrate the birth of my   first niece earlier this evening. Its exceptional. The pour is dark, dark brown with a modestly-sized rather coarse and sudsy head. (Despite the inelegant description, it was very pretty and almost deserves a 5 for appearance.) Aroma has a lot going on: molassas and nutmeg, apple and raisin. Theres even more going on in the flavor, to the point that it almost seems to be a hodgepodge at first sip - though as one enjoys instead of analyzing it leaves little to be desired.  Caramel apple with hints of sour oak, chocolate-covered toffee, again the nutmeg and mulling spice, dried plums. Hops are way in the background. The mouthfeel is exceptionally creamy, again nearly cloying at the first sip but mellowing as one goes forward to this exceptionally creamy milkshake showing exactly no hint of the 10% in heat, only in density. 

I dont want to analyze; this was a beer to savor and a beer that was hard to drink slowly. Wonderful.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Heavy fruit scented yeast esters in the nose: dates, plum, walnut, sweet.  Flavor is similar, amplified by a really pleasent creamy soft palate.  A bit too sweet and spicy (chemicals) up front, and over the middle its more of a artificial candy sweetness, like jolly ranchers.  Ends on a down note, with a lingering coating of this same artificial-like sweetness, but also with a lighter nut and fruit (trail mix?) note.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Front is decidedly sweet, grain presence perfect, bit of burnt toast and a hint of bitterness at the back, mouth feel almost full.

2265,"2007-08-28",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2007 2006 Bottle, Sampled August 2007
Pours with a mix of tightly beaded froth topped by larger bubble bath sized foam, both which add up to an initially three finger thick, creamed amber color; the head leaves a touch of lacing on the sides of the glass as I work my way through this beer.  The beer is a drab mix of dark amber and brown notes, but shows a beautiful, brilliantly clear, ruby-red color when held up to the light.  The aroma is an interesting, rich-leaning, mix of earthy spices, rich-concentrated fruits and dusty darker malt notes.  Aromas of prunes, figs apricots, caramelized apples, hints of cherries and fresh cut sweet / tart plums make up the concentrated fruit portion of the aroma.  These notes are boosted by malt notes of caramelized grain, brown sugar, and sugar glazed, browned bread crust.  The earthy spice notes add a subtle balancing note with touches of allspice, clove, cardamom, fenugreek .  Hints of warming alcohol towards the end mix with the fruitiness to sort of give this a brandy-like edge.  Really the fruit character (which strangely was the third thing I noticed after the spice notes and malt) is the dominant note in the aroma.

Rich enough to coat the mouth with a little bit of stickiness.  The alcohol and some spice-like notes cling to the palate adding a spicy, slightly astringent almost woody note that lingers on in the mouth after the beer has passed down my throat.  This beer is definitely sweet, but there is so much going on here that I am always distracted by other flavors and sensations before I think too long on the sweetness.  There is that woodiness that I mentioned (definitely noticeable & distinct to my palate, though somewhat subtle) and this pairs with a really subtle not that is almost peat like (a mix of salt, umami and smoke).  Soft spice notes of cardamom, nutmeg, sassafras, birch, perhaps a touch of licorice and a bit of pepper in the finish are all noticeable at times, but all are soft enough to actually keep me guessing at what might be the spices & what is from the fermentation character; this is of course the sign of a beer that has been spiced properly, as I dont want to be hit over the head by spices in a beer, but instead want them to add a nice, yet subtle backdrop that always keeps one guessing.  I definitely like how this beer feels so rich, but does not become cloying or sticky.

I am not sure of the difference between Pannepot and Pannepøt, but they are certainly different.  This beer seems to be a touch sweeter, and not nearly as aromatically fruity as Pannepot.  Ill definitely have to do a side by side of these two to explore them a bit more in depth.  As the beer warms up it loses a touch of sweetness, yet strangely notes of brown sugar and even molasses become evident.  Still that woody, almost peat like, spiciness is quite noticeable and it starts to mix in with a touch of warming alcohol towards the finish.  Definitely another really tasty offering from the Struis Brouwers.  I cant wait to crack my bottle of Aardmonnik!","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The flavor isnt as sweet and fruity, but its definitely there.  It doesnt taste too far off from the regular version.  i was expecting more fruit.  Definitely spicy and malty.  the caramel was quite evident and it was sweet on the palate and the finish.  I got some fruitiness in the aftertaste.  Maybe not quite as good as the original, but still very good.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
2265,"2007-08-08",3.8,"Pours a very dark brown that allows very little light through.  A large head dissapates quickly and leaves no lacing.  The aroma is chock full of Belgian candi sugar plums, and raisins.  The flavor is muddled.  While there are notes of dark chocolate, apple, grape, and a bready chewiness.  None of the flavors are distinct, however.  It seems more like a mashup of some tasty stuff.  The true saving grace of this beer is the mouthfeel.  Silky smooth and no bite whatsoever despite the 10% ABV.  Overall this is a beer that could be so, so good, but just isnt that far above average.","Bloomfield, New Jersey, USA","dogfishho"
2265,"2007-08-08",4.0,"Very dark mahogany pour and a very thin layer of foam that stays. Aroma of candi sugar, mollasses and dark fruits with a hint of chocolate. Taste is dark fruits, caramel sweetness, candi sugar, brown sugar, mollasses, floral hops. Bready notes in the background lead to a cloying fruity sweetness. Some chocolate notes in there as well as it warms with more fruits coming out and floral notes. Great mouthfeel and with little head the carbonation is actually very good. A very well made beer a lot like St. B 12. I dont know why but I just love the flavor and being so complex is very hard to describe.","Brook Park, Ohio, USA","crizay"

The aroma was light chocolate and dark fruits, citrus, not many spices picked up. The flavor was grapey chocolate and molasses, some dark fruits, smooth bready yeast type finish with each sip, enjoyable, yet with not nearly the same depth as the regular Pannepot. With 10% alcohol, why not crank up the flavors more, is this really that much more drinkable? (Will do them both side by side before too long). The mouthfeel was light, creamy, finishing with a light yeasty bite. Thanks, Robert. Re-rate, 9/07 w/ bfeld, very much the same experience, a little more nuttiness mixed in there.","","User37895"

Im finding the Danish and American version hard to compare because this beer really changes character a ton as it ages, gaining a big fruity spice character. The more sweet oaked flavors step aside to make way for a more Anchor OSA-like beer, focusing on a warm spiced beer flavor.

Notes of cherry, anise, licorice, nutmeg, ginger, bisquit and even a hint of bourbon. Its the strong cherry/anise combo that sets it apart.
Flavour is sweet and dominated by spices, anise in particular, with a malty aftertaste. Hops are discrete, and alcohol is well hidden. The velvet mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated to just prick the mouth gently.

Slightly hazy, ruddy amber colored pour with a thin layer of off-white head.  Aromas of fruity yeast esters with a hint of red berry and a bit of leathery prune-skin spice.  A light caramel maltiness is complimented by a yeast character that suggests raisiny fruits that are much darker than the color suggests.  A hint of herbal spice lingers as well, suggesting crushed coriander.  Medium bodied, crisply carbonated mouthfeel.  Pheonlic, yeasty flavors that are similar to Pannepot, but the malt body is not, as this beer is caramelly crisp and lacking the smoke and chocolatey malt of the sibling.

-The fluffy head is as impressive in both glasses, but the murky brown mud of the Pannepøt is not nearly as appetizing.
-The nose of the latter lacks the spicy, floral sweetness which tantalizes the nostrils in the regular version.
-Bready yeast dominates the flavor profile in Pannepøt, as roasted maltiness, earth and licorice sweetness fly about.
-Coriander milkiness is perceived, but not cleanly.
-The finish is quite dry instead of being a continuation of the complex malt-spice interplay which I am used to.
-Although a very good ale, this is simply not as cohesive and transcendent as the fantastic Pannepot.

Sweet taste with a complex malt profile that shifted accents throughout, starting out honey-like sweet, with strong caramel & vanilla, and ending up more liqourice-like sweet & tangy with fruity rum-soaked cherry and slight yeastyness in the long finish.

Bottle:  The aroma is yeast, fruit, plum, grape, candy sugar, a hint of chocolate, and alcohol.  It pours a cloudy orangish-red with a small off-white head.

2265,"2007-02-07",3.9,"Killer cloudy orange/amber with some brown at the edges. Slowly diminishing head of patchy but creamy light beige bubbles, in clusters. The aroma has an overall orange citrus feel about it, though no real hoppiness. A cacophony of perfumes springs forth from the glass, mainly lavender and chamomile. Caramel malt is aplenty in the nose. This is all rounded out with a sugariness that reminds of (baked brown)icing on top of pound cake. The flavor is definitely thinner and less interesting than Pannepot. It just doesnt have that invigorating puzzle piece. More noticeable alcohol and candi sugar, alongside big tangerine fruitiness. Semi-drying finish of commendable length and potency. The palate is creamy and smooth but I feel now that while this is excellent, its only half the brew the other version is. Im very appreciative for the opportunity to try this, thanks Joe.

2265,"2007-02-07",4.0,"Delighted to have an opportunity to taste this side by side with the original Pannepot at a group gathering. Theyre both spectacular beers. One thing bothers me. Ive sometimes wondered how much the order of beers in a tasting affects your impressions of each. That seems particularly relevant here as my conclusions run slightly against the grain - a marginal preference for this special edition over the original. My main criticism of this was the sweetness, which bordered on excessive. However, the original, which we sampled immediately after, seemed even sweeter. Is it sweeter or was that impression simply a consequence of drinking two sugary beers in a row? In other words, if the beers had been reversed, would this one have seemed even sweeter? Hmmm... Ah well, bugger it, you can only rate them as you see them. This one was cloudy brown with a dollop of crema. Theres a hint of vinyl in the aroma plus caramelised sugars, dried fruits and a faint lambic sourness that I didnt pick in the original. Lovely creamy palate. Oodles of sweet chocolate, toffee and a lip-smacking funky sour finish. (Bottle courtesy of Papsoe - thanks Henrik. RateBeer Sydney Jan 07 gathering)","Blue Mountains, AUSTRALIA","highlandlad"

2265,"2006-11-06",4.4,"With only a few years in the commercial business its somewhat difficult to imagine how the brewers at Struise were able to produce the paragon that is Pannepot. Even harder to imagine is what they will concoct for us next and whether it can possibly get any better. In any event, the excitement generated by this beer is genuinely deserved, and heres why. A rusted hue pinched with the slightest touch of garnet reflects the deep and meditative temper reinforced by its inspired subtitle ""Old Fishermans Ale"". The still cream that floats above sheds a sheet of dentelle glazed across any glass it touches and meticulously cemented like thousands of minuscule barnacles. I have little seafaring experience myself, but Hollywood has me picturing a man in a crusted beard looking twice his age and capped of a chapeau dark as the ocean, sipping from a chalice in the days sole moment of grace. As I return from my reverie, the beer facing me has not changed but exudes a complex pastiche reminding at once of the classical Trappists and the conversely avant-gardist brewers. Deep molasses and brown sugar reminiscent again of Struises Speculoos are jolted with banana, figs and plums. Cloves, pepper and coriander provide a balancing spice profile that naturally flows into a sylvan aroma of soil, artichoke and walnuts. Dense but sweet almost succulent, yet open, airy and dry at the same time. Theres cream, theres terroir, theres everything you would want - its abracadabrantly balanced. Pannepot transitions to the tongue very organically as its noses echo resounds on the palate in a flurry of roasted coffee and dark chocolate flavors. Cardamom and allspice are part of this orchestral composition that with warming evolves a flowery form of banana, and the juices of grape and cherry. The swallow unveils a long and complex aftertaste blending coffee, pepper, coriander, caramel and a touch of hops. Every bit of this beer is worth seeking out and shows yet another example of Belgiums young and talented brewers. Whats almost scary is how juvenile my bottle still was and the potential it showed for aging after only a couple months in my cellar.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Pours a murky, muddy brown with a thick, moussy, bubbly tan head. The nose seems to contain every tree fruit I know about, and some of the berries--plum, cherry, dark sugar, light sugar (Red Delicious apples), and a whisper of sour/tart citrus sugars, too. These fruity goodnesses persist on the attack, and to some lesser extent on the mid palate. Theres roast and nut and caramel in the inverse proportion--scarcely there on the nose, but they rise through the mid-palate convincingly. As the beer warms (alas, we poured it too cold), the finish grows dryer and dryer--shockingly so for such a fruitily sugary-smelling beer.

Poured a dull, ruby copper with a slight yeast haze and very fine carbonation. Head was a little limp to form and ended in a tight but flaccid and thin pad of tan that left minimal lace. Aroma was striking, unique and unfortunately not altogether integrated. Bits and pieces of old, musty fell fruit, wooded overripe berries, cough medicine, savoury figs and sultanas, aniseed and fresh crushed ginger, a little dark fudge and some candi that wafted continuously from the glass. Quite honestly interesting though. Comes together in the mouth. Big, creamy, malty and treacly thick palate. Carbonation is gentle but attacks all corners of the mouth heightening the flavours to full effect. Rich toffee, chocolate mud-cake, plum-wine and madeira, huge presence of dark fruits including ripe plums, blackberries and some tart cranberries and aniseed, and ofcourse a nice mellowing presence of infused alcohol that lifts it and manages to warm like an elixir. It is quite peppery, spicy and has a nice bitter edge that it peaks at before it drops off long with liquorice, deep malts and a little Benadryl, and some more savoury fruits in the aftertaste. This was a young sample, but it is oh so good. Flavours are raw and well defined yet they meld with such articulate perfection. The only mar would be its alcohol which as it warms becomes more aggressive and solvent-like, but with age I think this would mellow. I loved this and just hope that I can come across a few more bottles, a little more locally than half-way across the globe. Very, very nice slow sipper.

2265,"2006-06-04",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 12, 2006 Draught  Pannepøt 2006  unclear golden (?!) small bubbled head; Deep, deep  complex nose with lots of white fruit: lots of peach, lots of fresh and dry apricot, fresh cane sugar (exactly the aroma you get when you chew a fresh stick of cane sugar, the combination of fresh raw sugar and bamboo, or cane sugar juice), but also a little of the bitter, sourness from dried fruits like fig; Super complex deep, deep body, very, very well balanced simply amazing, with perfect amount of carbonation; Finishing very, very, very long in a sweet and a little sour fresh way, again with lots of raw cane sugar but also peach and fresh ripe apple and again apricot. The slight sourness really fits the Pannepot. This one is maybe a bit to raw sugar sweet, but definitely the best of the Pannepots.","Aarhus, DENMARK","henrikb"
