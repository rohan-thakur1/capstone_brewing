Z czasem dochodzą suszone owoce na czele z rodzynkami, choć da się też wyczuć wiśnie. Smak jest srednio słodki, mocno karmelowy, ale bardziej w typie toffee niż palonego cukru. Ogrom rodzynek, wiśni, śliwki, melasy, bourbonu. Wszystko fajnie zbudowane i zbalansowane, bez chaosu. W posmaku dochodzą nuty szlachetnego alkoholu które miło palą w gardło, dając znać o tym, że nie jest to lekkie piwerko i swoją wagę posiada.

AROMA: bourbon, bourbon, bourbon y más bourbon, coco tostado, vainilla, algo de madera, caramelo, toffee, algunos frutos oscuros maduros ligeramente. SABOR: al inicio del trago se siente dulce y presencia del alcohol, seguido del bourbon dominante nuevamente pero no tanto como en aroma, madera, vainilla y coco tostado se aprecian de manera marcada, inclusive en algunos tragos destaca muchísimo más esa nota a coco tostado; notas a caramelo, toffee, frutos oscuros maduros como higos y pasas también presentes. En el retrogusto queda un amargor medio, dulce y con persistencia ligera de las características de la barrica. SENSACIÓN: cuerpo medio ligero, baja carbonatación.

300,"2015-02-06",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2015 Egy kevés utánajárást azért megkövetelt, mire arra a megállapításra jutottam, hogy a kezemben lévő Lost Abbey darab a Bourbon Barrel verziót testesíti meg, mivel az üveg címkéje nem feltétlenül nyújt egyértelmű iránymutatást az ügyben. A Ratebeer honlapján az alap verzió és a bourbon hordóban érlelt típus címkéje sem passzol azzal a változattal, amit az utóbbi főzet neve alatt szerepeltetve alkalmam volt megszerezni, az interneten rendelkezésre álló fotók azonban a birtokomban lévő üveg képét örökítik meg a ""Bourbon Barrel"" karakterrel felruházott ital vonatkozásában. Kólaszín-árnyalatú testére halovány habréteg ül, keskeny karimájú fedelet rajzolva az italra. Az illatai egyszerűen utánozhatatlanok, a legelegánsabb barley wine-aromák, amiket valaha éreztem. A puha selyemcukros, édesített paradicsomleves, fodormentás és pillecukros csemege hangulata kóstolásra buzdít, hívogató aromái egyszerre simák és feltűnésmentesek, ugyanakkor megismételhetetlenül egyedi stílusúak, kókuszos fahordós, vajas bourbon-karakterű, mazsolás hangulatúak. Ízvilága a mennyei manna körvonalait hordozza, keserédes datolya és füge, mályvacukor, vaníliás whisky jegyeit jeleníti meg, vakító élénkségű aromái apró szénsavbuborékokkal tarkított kortyokban öltenek testet, melyek olajosan csúsznak. A hordóérlelés jótékony hatása már-már tökéletesnek ható szerkezetet biztosít a főzetnek, a karakteres árpaborok szerelmesei mindenesetre ne keresgéljenek tovább.","HUNGARY","adster"

Definitely a singeing alcoholic burn that is reminicent of taking a small shot after every taste. Medium-low carbonation. My burps taste like whiskey, fuck you. Warm aftertaste, warm. I like regular barley wines a bit better, not sure Im down with barrel aging.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Caytinator"

This is not a pretty beer. Murky brown with absolutely no carbonation. Thankfully this is Angels Shares worst quality. 

Recovery from an underwhelming look is quick. Aroma is stellar. Ive not encountered a better smelling barleywine than this one. Rich as rich can be. Cut vanilla bean, graham cracker, aged bourbon, still present booze, charred oak, sweet salted caramel. Its absolutely decadent, and I havent had a sip.

Taste is good, but not on par with smell. All the appeal of a standard setting English barleywine are present, including sweet caramel malt, cotton candy, and prominent alcohol. Additionally, I readily taste bourbon, white grape, red apple, slight red pepper, strong vanilla, and a hint of aged brandy. Very complex and thoroughly enjoyable. 

Mouthfeel is so-so. While the body is great, the complete absence of carbonation mars the overall experience. A few bubbles would make this beer significantly better.

Appearance: The body is a murky brown thats opaque through the center, no head at all, only a very thin ring.
Aroma: The aroma is a bit musky with dark fruits that is rather strong, oak is also prominent with a light alcohol presence and perhaps some molasses.
Taste: The oak is pretty strong here right away with lots of wood presence, theres a musky raisin fruit throughout and the finish is pretty strong of bourbon becoming dry with a light burn on the finish. Not really a fan of this.
Palate: Thick, but at the same time a bit thin, just a very little amount of carbonation.
Overall: This is a pretty big disappointment to me, theres nothing here that I love about this, its just okay. I dont care to seek this out again.
2013 Vintage.
Appearance: The body is black with deep mahogany through the edges, the head is dense with great retention, slowly settling into a dense brown coating.
Aroma: The aroma is strong of bourbon and oak right away, but  brown sugar and caramel back it with hints of milk chocolate and even some roasted malts. The aroma is restrained though, perhaps some coconut?
Taste: Coconut is prominent right away and becomes a strong persistent flavor throughout, all the way to the finish where it lingers for a bit. Backing the coconut is light caramel and brown sugar and bourbon on the mid-taste, the bourbon persists through the finish with a lingering spicy kick to it. Certainly heavy on coconut though.
Palate: Creamy and thick.

A: Whoa, carbonation! Not just from the etching on the bottom of the glass, but there were lots of bubbles and a thin light tan head actually formed on the pour. That subsided quickly leaving a pretty still dark brown, cola looking body with a thin ring around the rim. Some splotchy lace is left down the glass.

S: Smells of bourbon, oak, dark pitted fruits and some subtle sweetness all fill the nose.

T: Big bourbon up front that lingers throughout the whole sip. As it develops in the mouth the oak comes through as well as a caramel like sweetness. Some dried fruits, mainly figs and dates, also pop up in the taste. There is some definite heat in there, but it is far from from overpowering.

M: Heavy bodied, slightly chewy in nature with some actually prickly carbonation. Im psyched. A little heat and some subtle sweetness left on the palate. As the beer warms the carbonation goes by the wayside, but it doesnt hurt the beer.

O: Well this gets major points because its actually somewhat carbonated. The bourbon flavor is bold and lingers throughout the whole sip, but still is pretty tasty. This is definitely a sipper.

300,"2012-03-13",4.5,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/17/2011.  Served on tap in a tulip at Hopleaf.

My pour is a totally opaque mahogany color, with a few spots of ruby or burgundy in the corners of the glass. A modest tan head melts away over the first half of the glass, not bothering to leave any lace. It is noticeably viscous as I swirl it in my glass.

The aroma is outstanding; a true wake up call after drinking a few milder beers. A complex spectrum of sweet aromas just burst out of the glass. The bourbon is noticeable, more so in the nose than in the flavor, with figs, dates, and raisins providing the fruit notes. Sweet toffee, caramel, and dark chocolate fudge overwhelm the milder bready malt notes. This is close to perfect.

The flavor starts strong as well, and each component is so well-integrated it takes me a few sips to distinguish each one. Dark gooey caramel, a bit of molasses, and some dark Belgian chocolate provide a sweet candy front, dark caramel and lightly roasted malt feed off the sweetness and add more depth. A blast of figs and rum raisin come in and lead to the ridiculous depth to the flavor. A light bourbon note overlays the rest of the sip, which is comprised of oak, a generous amount of vanilla, some coconut, and a few more dark fruit flavors. The finish is mostly sweet, with just a touch of bitterness and alcohol to keep the sweetness in check. 

To call this anything less than full bodied would be blasphemy. There is no doubt about the intention of this beer - a full bodied, creamy, sweet, and complex brew, and the mouthfeel is consistent with this goal. Smooth and creamy for sure, it is a little syrupy at times, which is the only reason for the less than perfect score. It is properly carbonated, but the carbonation is hardly noticeable given everything else that is going on here.

This is a beer that borders on greatness. I had a less than stellar experience with a flat Brandy Angels Share bottle, but the difference is like night and day. From the moment I had my first whiff of it, I knew this was going to be a special beer. The bourbon treatment is remarkably well done, neither destroying the flavor nor the mouthfeel of the base beer. A huge beer packed with taste and complexity. For me, this is worth seeking out when it is available.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

I have had great Bourbon Angels Share in the past,but this particular keg needed more carbonation and less jet fuel.","Mount Misery, Valley Forge, ","LIVEFAST"
300,"2012-02-03",4.5,"2009 Version Reviewed 2010 - The smell of this beer is just simply amazing.  Its a assault on your nose.  Huge amounts of bourbon, caramel, toffee, dark fruits, vanilla, and oak.  I really cant describe this smell.  I mean I just did but its something that needs to be experienced first hand.  Simply awesome.

The taste is world class too but a little bit muted compared to the aroma.  Maybe its the little bit of age I put on the brew.  I dont know but that doesnt mean it isnt a fantastic taste.  The bourbon flavor is king here.  It lingers in your mouth.  Every other flavor is balanced perfectly between the caramel, toffee, dark fruits ,etc.  Alcohol burn plays a big factor in the mouthfeel on this beer.  It burns the mouth, throat, and stomach.   Need a great beer on a cold night, here it is.  It will keep you warm.  The mouthfeel is also thick, syrupy, and coats the mouth.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","drunkenpolack"
300,"2012-01-30",2.7,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2012 This bottle was sent to me as a replacement for an infected, flat bottle of Brandy Angels share that I purchased. Poured into a snifter.

A: Very minimal carbonation evident. Virtually no head whatsoever. It is not completely flat (like the infected bottle of Brandy Angels Share that I had to drainpour) but it is obviously lacking in significant carbonation. Some carbonation does appear upon swirling the glass. Otherwise, pours a dark brown with tinges of dark ruby red evident as well.

S: Bourbon, vanilla, malt, booze, dark fruits. The aroma is enticing. I have smelled better but I have also smelled worse. I think the aroma would be significantly improved if the carbonation were present to a higher degree.

T: I have to say, I do love the taste of this. Very smooth. Lots of vanilla and bourbon for sure. Also get some booze, raisins, figs, dates, brown sugar, and molasses too. Pretty strong malt backbone. A little bit of wood. Hints of chocolate as well. I really cant knock the taste of this one despite the lack of appropriate carbonation. All of the tastes are pretty well balanced in my opinion and I enjoyed it.

M: Again, very little carbonation evident. That being said, this remains a relatively easy drinker in my opinion. A little on the slick side. While some alcohol is evident, it is definitely not overpowering, offensive, or ""hot"" in the least. I just wish there were more carbonation there.","Tennessee, USA","StoutimusPrime"
300,"2012-01-29",4.7,"2011 bottle pours near black with almost no carbonation or head. A small whitish ring clings to the glass, but is nearly non-existent. Served around 55 degrees.

Pours murky dark brown, nearly black in the glass with a faint brown head that recedes to almost nothing pretty quick.  Second pour was closer to room temp and produced a decent head with slightly better retention.  

Aroma is strong bourbon and a lot of rich, complex malt.  Tons of dark fruit, prunes, figs, raisins, dates, black currants, some molasses, nuts, dark bread/toast, vanilla and oak.  Very good strength.

Flavor starts with a blast of bourbon, oak, vanilla, rich dark fruit and malt, prunes, figs, raisins, black currant, molasses, anise, hints of caramel and bread, dark tobaccos, strong warming alcohol on the finish.  

Mouthfeel is medium-plus bodied, low carbonation, sticky.

Fantastic stuff.  Huge and incredibly complex beer.  You better love bourbon as it isnt subtle at all.  I think I like this a touch better than the Brandy Barrel version.  While I can live with the near lack of carbonation, some bubbles certainly would ramp this up a bit in the appearance and mouthfeel categories.  Letting this warm up to near room temperature really helped open this up a lot.","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"

300,"2011-08-01",4.0,"375ml bottle from the IPB. 2010 written below the label.

Appearance : Opens with no sound. Black with no head. Little bubbles.

Aroma : Rich bourbon notes with figs and raisins. Overcooked caramel notes. Some vanilla with notes of alcohol. Great chewy malts behind the alcohol.

Taste : Rather well balanced. Fruity figs and raisins with light bourbon notes. Finish gets more intense with strong bourbon presence (but not that much vanilla notes). Rather bitter combined with the alcohol bite makes it rather sharp. Nice caramel and fruity sweetness. Nice lingering warmth.

Palate : Very light fizz on the tongue. Carbonation seemed almost absent at first but its actually there but very subtle. Almost absent at first but it tickled the tongue on the finish.

Overall : Very complex with a very nice bourbon presence. Still quite warm and a bit too alcoholic for my taste but it goes well with the beer. Awesome winter sipper. Nevertheless, Im slightly disappointed by this. I would have liked a little bit more carbonation and a bit less alcohol. Still, its very complex and very well balanced except for the alcohol. I feel the complexity and finesse behind all the alcohol but have a hard time getting the most of it. It seems others had more carbonated bottles. Ill re-rate if I ever get a chance.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

300,"2011-07-31",4.0,"Bottle thanks to ketchepillar. We are pretty sure what we have here is a 2007 bottle of this here Angels Share Bourbon Barrel. Whatever vintage it is, it was the one that was supposed to be over carbonated. After some time in the freezer the cork still shot out of this one with ease. The beer pours a deep reddish brown color with a small well retained head and some good lace. The aroma is stinky feet for quite a while till the beer warms and plenty of cordial and bourbon show up. Its a pretty pungent smelling beer throughout though. The flavor has lots of sweet vanilla driver bourbon character and loads of malty and roasty flavors. Plenty of cordial liqueur shows up here. The beer is very viscous and the carbonation at a higher level doesnt seem to be much of a problem. I always suspected Id like this one if I got a good bottle, and we sure got a good bottle.

300,"2011-06-03",4.2,"Bottle from South Bay Drugs: Finally able to get a bottle of this since I had only tasted the brandy barrell on several occasions.  Poured into my pint glass as a thick and creamy liquid with a deep and dark shade of mahogany hue and was topped by a small layer of foam as a head. The aroma was incredibly bold of whiskey bourbon barrel, raisin, wood, maple syrup, cigar tobacco, caramel and dried fig or date. Basically, the scent of this beer is all over the place and that earns a perfect score because of quickly it made me salivate.  After taking my first few sips, I could tell this was a much more rounded version of Angels Share and it seemed the wood from the bourbon was much more apparent.  There is a sweet base of sugary syrup like malts that dominate over all else, but there is also room for a strong dosage of alcohol that reminds me of vodka or a bland flavored whiskey. Also, a touch of raisin or fig is noticed in the aftertaste and a sweet residue of a high quality cigar.

300,"2011-05-26",3.9,"2011-05-26. Very dark brown-black body, small tan head fades quickly. 3+ First aroma notes are of a woody malt melange that is a bit reminiscent of Thomas Hardys. The character has blended together in a way that makes it tough to separate it out, bourbon, but it presents differently from most bourbon beer. Flavour is similar, a malty base with interesting bourbon character weaved throughout, hints of what could uncharitably be described as marmite are more generously attributed to a wood-bourbon-malt melange that I find alternately intriguing and off-putting. Dry bourbon notes in the finish with a mild bitterness from the alcohol. Alcohol presence is surprisingly restrained for the strength, but makes itself known by warming the throat and stomach. Malt fades out a bit as it warms, with the bourbon coming more to the forefront, but overall it is surprisingly smooth and the bourbon is more pleasant to my tastes than many others. Smooth medium to full bodied palate is nearly uncarbonated.Ultimately it is not to my tastes enough that I would drink it regularly, but I find it very interesting. I enjoyed the second half of the glass more than the first, after I acclimated to the bourbon character.   Does not have the depth of rich malt sweetness that I remember from the brandy version.

The smell is dominated by bourbon through and through. There are hints of oak, alcohol, and fruits. It isnt super complex, mainly bourbon. There is a hint of chocolate that hints in but never becomes super noticeable.

The bourbon dominates the flavor, though it isnt as alcoholic as I was expecting. It has some caramel, vanilla, and oak, but that is about it. There is some walnuttiness that comes through, almost like a stale maibock in the finish I was hoping for something with more complexity, this is basically bourbon flavored beer.

300,"2011-03-07",3.7,"375mL 2010 ed. Pours a tepid deep red to mahogany with bubbles but no head formation.

Intense, soft, and the highlight of the beer. The taste is soft, buttery, raisin heavy, with some powerful, sharp alcohol kick that is not hot whatsoever but definitely present giving this quite the intense bite in the back end. Medium bodied with light grape skin tartness and tannins. A quick, dusty palate verges on cardboardy but is saved but lingering butteriness. Overall its a bit too sweet and cola heavy in the body and thin on the palate that it seems to me like bourbon, cherry coke, and ice cream.

A- Body is a translucent, nearly opaque dark brown body. A rather aggressive pour still leaves this beer flat-with absolutely no head. Flat abbey strikes again (actually Ive had probably 20 or so brews from them and this is only the second or third flat one).

S- Nose is potent and pretty much as the bottle describes-A ton of caramel malt and bourbon characteristics, as well as a good amount of alcohol astringency. A mild to moderate amount of wet oak looms in the background as well as the slightest touch of toffee and chocolate.

T-Overall impression of the taste is slightly sweet, slightly boozy. Its got a good bit of caramel and molasses to it and the heat comes in up front. Letting the sip linger on the palate really brings out a lot of complexity with chocolate, oak, and toffee- the finish has a touch of what seems to be an impression of candi sugar before the heat returns-and lingers on and on.

M- Mild carbonation and a thick, viscous body that would be ultra velvety smooth if it wasnt for the alcohol consistency/astringency with a moderate presence. The feel isnt nearly as flat as the appearance.

D- This is an interesting beer overall. Kind of comes off as a BA scotch ale-which is a very cool concept-and I havent tried many. The bourbon is a little hot and heavy and I probably could have been a bit more patient with this one.

300,"2011-01-24",4.4,"From notes:

2008 vintage. Pours pitch black and completely opaque with only the slightest of mahogany edges when held to a light source. Two finger frothy beige head with decent retention, only slowly fading into a thin lasting ring. Sporadic splotches f lacing left behind. Ah, the good old days when LAs big beers were properly carbonated.

The barrel aging has resulted in a boozy bourbon aroma with hints of earthy oak, vanilla and marshmallow. Underneath the huge bourbon barrel presence theres hints of roasted malt, smoke, chocolate, caramel and toffee. All of these elements are blended nicely, creating a very impressive nose.

Medium bodied and better balanced than the aroma suggests. I was expecting a massive, one dimensional bourbon bomb but this beer is very complex with multiple flavors bouncing off of each other. As in the aroma, the bourbon barrel presence is dominant with hints of sweet booze, earthy oak and sweet vanilla notes. The flavor of the bourbon is strong but this beer isnt very hot and the high ABV is well masked. Underneath the bourbon there is some luscious chocolate malt, toffee, caramel, smoke and coffee bean. Slightly roasted with a very subtle lactic creaminess adding to the complexity and improving drnikability. Nice warmth in the finish.

This was the first vintage of this beer that Ive sampled and it exceeded all of my expectations. Incredibly complex, well balanced and damn quaffable. Subsequent batches have failed to live to the 08.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Full, luxuriously rich body with a firm, sturdy, boozy palate that slides across the tongue and eases itself warmly down the throat and into the belly. Finishes with insane sweetness and booziness.

4.0 A: Dark bar, but looks like black with small tan head. Reasonable lacing.

4.5 S: Overwhelming aroma is bourbon, but it is backed up with great complexity. Alcohol, dark crystal sweetness, plum fruitiness, and a touch of tobacco.

4.0 M: Heavier medium body. Would prefer a touch more carbonation. Reasonably smooth with alcohol on finish.

This is the Christmas beer for 2010, purchased this fall and stored in much anticipation! :-) Consumed on Christmas Day, but as a stand-alone brew rather than a pairing - I hardly want stout Norwegian Christmas food to interfere with this elegant beauty. Pours a headless, deep brown body with a small maelstrom of bubbles on top, active enough to put any suspicions that this is a dead beer aside. Still, the opaque, retention-devoid surface beckons in a mysterious way. I dip my nose in and immediately get the bourbon flavors: oaky, syrupy, soy-like salt licorice tones, some milk chocolate and roasted malts, flanked with boozy notes and hints of pea- and coconut. Absolutely delicious. The first sip reveals a rather balanced brew, not overtly flavorful, heavy or strong as one could perhaps expect after the initial aroma. Well-toned notes of soy, booze, peanut, roasted malts, hints of peat, red grapes and wood are quite well interwoven, and the massive 12,5 % ABV hardly show at all, except for in the warming aftertaste. Very well made. A bit more carbonation would have helped though, as this beer is very dense and syrupy. Nevertheless, a world-class barley wine, oozing of respect and craftsmanship.

Finding this in the back of the cellar with a few other beers to save for later I decided to crack it open. After a run of more mundane stuff I was craving something brash and bold. A Top 50 worthy barley wine aged in bourbon seemed like just the ticket and it met all my expectations. This is marginally better than the brandy alternative (which was no slouch itself). Were it not $20 Id probably try to trade for more.

Aroma / Appearance - Carbonated with a dense blackish brown body the lacing was like a thin film of plastic. Vanilla, oak, heavy dark chocolate, and plum made this so rich I almost reached for a spoon. It was so good that I spent over ten minutes just soaking in the aroma before daring to take a sip.

Flavor / Palate - Chocolate truffles, vanilla, and a finger of bourbon create a dessert like texture. Thick and creamy this can chewed if you like to really take your time. Fig sneaks in after a few sips to add even more enjoyment. The alcohol is well balanced. Obviously you cant hide 12.5% but you can do what Port has done and add enough flavor that it doesnt dominate. A tingling bitterness sits in the throat after everything else is done soaking in.

300,"2010-09-05",3.8,"From old notes.  An interesting and complex beer but it doesnt quite work for me.  The base beer seems quite enjoyable.  Its like a big barleywine with some deeper roast and dark fruit notes.  Theres more going on in there than I can quite describe, but the bourbon flavor seemed to overpower some of this complexity.  It has raisins, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, oak and even mild coffee and chocolate.  This version just didnt come together for me as much as the Grand Cru.  Its not quite a mess, but the alcohol heat was a bit much and the bourbon flavor sort of threw things out of whack more than it blended the flavors into a harmony.  For bourbon barrel barleywines, Ill take FW Parabola, AS Grand Cru and even Marins -bal Old Dipsea.  I would have preferred this beer aged in a neutral oak barrel or perhaps just less time in the bourbon.  Its still rather good - hard to dislike a beer with so many interesting layers to it.  Mouthfeel is a bit sticky (and some bottles probably arent carbonated properly but my notes are from the keg version).

Aroma of whisky (not whiskey), malt, and dark fruit- all very restrained, except for the alcohol.  Hits the mouth with a high-medium body, some malt, some booze- but let it sit.  Let it wait.  The nothingness after the swallow after a ""good minute"" slowly lets a wave of vanilla come in.  This sensation transcends to moderate tobacco, then hard molasses.  The finish runs forever, and there is not stop.  If I could create a beer that finished like this, I would rule the world.  If I could create a beer with some many levels on the finish, (CENSORED) - their heads would explode (Oh yeah, its that bad!!!  Bad is in DAMN, not bad as in bad).

Beer crept out of the bottle before pouring and made a big, brown pillowy head. Pretty nice looking beer, dark murky brown with a thick head. Aroma was tons of dark fruit, rum/bourbon, toasted nuts, caramel malt and some woodiness.  The flavour was more of the same and very similar to the brandy version. Actually left a sweet, sticky film on my lips. I honestly think I liked the brandy version a touch better because there seemed a little too much ""bourbon barrel goodness"" for me. Still good but maybe over-the-top for my palate.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"

Really great beer which Ive enjoyed multiple times since. 8/4/9/4/16 = 4.1 Rerate of 2008, 5/22/2010. After two years, this is definitely picking up quite a bit of oxidation.

Wow, after the 2008, the nose on this is really fresh and bright, nice bourbon character, and some nice roastiness. Holy fucking hot boozebomb. This stuff might be 12.5%, but it tastes like 30%. Besides the blazing inferno of alcohol and bourbon, lots of dark fruit, light roast, coconut, molasses. Its also worthy to note that it does have a very nice, light carbonation, that could not be confused with being flat. 8/4/6/4/14 = 3.6","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"

First, I would like to thank the folks at Lost Abbey for fixing a previous problem by sending this... class act, guys.  Second, I would confirm the assessment that there is no carbonation, but it has absolutely no impact on my thoughts on this beer...  I think carbonation would be a distraction given what unfolds.  Pours a fairly dark brown with dense aromas of raisins, chocolate, toffee, and... as it warms... bourbon.  I didnt pick it up much right out of the bottle, but 5 minutes later and it hits you in the face.  Flavor is heavy with sticky sweet brown sugar and raisin.

Cork pops with a whoosh and the beer bubbles up but doesnt overflow. It pours a deep luxurious walnut brown with an ample tan head, leaving rainbows of lace along the sides of my glass. The aroma is simply divine, a sure 10. Rich caramels meld with -- rather than being overlaid by -- deep bourbon aromas, true vanilla and oak rather than brash young burnt oak chips, dates and pecan pie, lovely.

After the relatively sweet aroma, the flavor startles -- not nearly as sweet as I expected, actually some mild sour notes, a bourbon richness that is so beautifully melded its like no other bourbon aged beer Ive ever tasted. This is to other BA beers as fresh wild strawberries are to strawberry starburst.

300,"2009-10-27",3.7,"Enjoyed from a 750ml bottle in an elongated tulip glass.  The beer pours a murky deep brown with no head.  Carbonation is low, relatable to that of an English mild or cask ale.  The nose shows a complex interplay of malt depth, as well as some notes of vanilla and whiskey from the barrel aging.  The palate shows the same level of complexity, giving malt sweetness up front, followed by a just-short-of-balancing hop presence, the aforementioned vanilla, and finishing with a moderate alcoholic presence that adds yet more depth, but also detracts from some of the flavors at the beginning of the palate.  Another item that detracts slightly from the beers overall flavor is a high level of residual sweetness that gives a port-like character.  I would have liked to see a bit drier a finish.  Overall, enjoyable, if rare and expensive.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Dark unsweetened chocolate, plums, a bit of a vinous grapey character.  Tobacco and leather in there.  A bit of hot bourbon around the edges.

300,"2009-09-05",4.6,"375ml 2009 bottle.  Aroma is incredibly pungent, with very strong vanilla notes layered atop dark, dried fruit such as fig and raisins.

Really strong woody vanilla on the entry, coupled with bourbon notes and raisins.  Oh my, the finish.  There is more sweet in the finish -- vanilla, some licorice and bourbon  but in a wave of ridiculously delicious complexity, I also got robust earthy, almost peaty notes in the finishing essence.  Angels Share just evokes all of the human senses in ways I have never experienced in a beer.  And to add my two-sense to the LA carbonation debate:   the 2009 bottle is basically flat, BUT I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT.  The richness and sweetness of this brew actually successfully complements a low-carbonation rate, in my opinion.

300,"2009-08-18",4.4,"Thanks for the opportunity to try this one Dennis! The controversial Lost Abbey, which for the record has been pretty good to me so far.

Pours a very dark red/brown, looks black without light. Head produces a belgian loking foamy goodness, mocha in color.

Scent is strong bourbon up front. Smell some chocolate, rasins, and caramel in there. Id like to try a non barrel aged version of this, the sheer strength of the bourbon overshadows what smells pretty damn interesting, but I digress, it still smells very good.

Taste is not nearly as boozy as the smell, and actually makes for a nice concoction. I believe this is from the 2008 batch, and the little bit of age has taken the booze to the back, some very nice roasted and chocolate malts in front. Damn great tasting drink. I didnt expect to like this one as much as I do.

Mouth is a slight issue, while the body is adequately thick at around a medium on the scale, it is a tad too bubbly. I may actually prefer the ""flat"" brandy version from this year. I rank just above average because while it is distracting, it doesnt ruin the drink by any means.

300,"2009-08-15",3.9,"2008 bottling: Creamed caramel. Creamy voluminous froth. Refined and seriously decadent aromatics of Bananas Foster, muscovado sugar, marzipan, sherry, milk chocolate, and cakey malt. Hint of iron complements the richness. Spirited carbonation condenses as it hits the palate. Immediately rich and sharply sugary with caramelized-oak which mirrors that of the sugary grit. Not overly soft in the malt department early on, and the somewhat stark cola-like sweetness briefly hampers further development. Oak is fairly fuzzy rather than clearly defined. Alcohol  is masterfully concealed. Sturdy cassis and liquefied licorice is pillared by sherry-drizzled cake and thickset, welll-developed malt which soothes the throat as it glides down the gullet.  Coconut and aged leather slyly emerge to complement the port-steeped plum succulence. Exhibits good restraint given the immense weight. Vanilla remains merely suggestive, and the malt vivid while the high level of attenuation makes for a semi-airy exit.  I must say this is one of the few beers that seems to have benefited, or at least did not suffer, from (minor) oxidation. I find that the sherry character beautifies the polished malt complexities and also echoes the candyish qualities. Enjoyable.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Deep vanilla bean and raisin aroma-it actually smells chewy.  The bourbon is subtle in the aroma-there is more fruity sweetness than whiskey sweetness: pears, over ripe apples, mashed sweet cherries and plums.  Mouth feel is super creamy and soft...the carbonation adds to the creaminess instead of making it fizzy.  Flavours match the aroma in depth, but the sweetness is subdued-the raisins are more malty and bready than sweet and the over ripe apples a tart bite and the plums have morphed into prunes: rich and almost chocolaty.  Lingering stickiness on the tongue and lips smacks with wisps of whiskey bitterness and oak.  More balanced than any bourbon barrel aged beer I can remember...amazing that the alcohol is hidden too-I believe this is what everyone strives for when the put beer in bourbon barrels: sweetness to enhance the aroma and depth of flavour to enhance the taste-without being cloying or tasting like a nip of whiskey.

Aroma is just glorious: Brown sugar, molasses, honey, maple, and yeah, bourbon. Ooh, this is a lot smoother than the brandy-aged, I can say right off the bat. Again molasses, but now theres chocolate, spoiled dark fruit with gives it a slight sourness, theres a lot going on here. Very complex. Bourbon is huge throughout the flavor and finish, but not too cumbersome really. Mouthfeel is a little watery, aftertaste is pure whiskey, like I just took a shot of 80-proof. Alcohol is clear and present from start to finish, and actually makes this seem more around 15% as it shamelessly puts itself at or near the forefront of every facet. I didnt think that this would be that different from the Brandy Barrel, but it really is. A lot smoother, more mature, and less agressive. A real pleasure. Overall, world class.","California, USA","Gypsy19"

300,"2009-04-29",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2009 This rating for the original 2007 Release.
In short: A big earthy malt orgy the American way, nothing more, nothing less.  Excellent.
How: Bottles 375ml.  Original bottling (2007).  Bottles sent to me by doubleO, hapjydeuce, WeeHeavySD.  Thanks to you all guys.
The look: Near black body topped by a small tan head
In long: This is not a normal rating.  This is a comparative rating from a blind tasting of the original Angels Share (2006 bottling) and the original Bourbon Barrel aged (2007 bottling).  Complete description in my Angels Share rating which I had on many occasions.  This Bourbon Barrel version has a slightly stronger carbonation, soft in the regular Angels Share, medium in this one.  The Bourbon Barrel has a little more caramel and the alcohol is a bit more present.  This Bourbon Barrel aged feels a tiny bit more roasted than the original.  But to make a long story short I was surprised at how similar the regular Brandy Barrel and the Bourbon Barrel were.  The barrel character was hard to identify in both (very subtle or very well integrated) and during the blind tasting we kept changing our mind about which was which.  I really wanted to pick a favourite at the blind tasting but I kept changing my mind.   The truth is that it was impossible for me to pick a less excellent.  I felt like a father who has to chose which of his two sons to sacrifice in order to feed the starving family.  With both sons looking equally delicious.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

300,"2009-04-25",4.3,"My angel descended upon me on late evening to share with me her bourbon-barrel blessings. Her murky earthen brown depths hide darker glimpse of midnight black while a tiny halo rests atop her head. Like a sprinkling of star, lace twinkles mischievously as I bask in her rich aroma of chocolate covered cherries, soft pie-crust, and bourbon-soaked raisins. A soft presence of ginger and spice linger in the background. Enthralled by my angels song, we meet in a sinfully sweet kiss of rich cinnamon, ginger, and spice with brown-sugar sweetness leading to dates, plums, prunes, and raisins. Permeating all of her bounty, bourbon exudes warmth with faint vanilla notes. Further on in our relationship, green vegetal notes such as asparagus and broccoli along with dry spices perch atop my tongue, adding dryness to her finish. Ever growing warmth mingles and soothes while softer notes of ginger, spice, and booze-soaked raisins leave the longest lasting impression. I havent had the original Angels Share yet, but every mouth-watering quaff of Lost Abbeys Bourbon-Barrel Angels Share has been heavenly. The bourbon does not overwhelm, instead exuding comforting warmth with a hint of wood, spice, and vanilla while the rest of her bounty speak for itself. As is with all good things though, we must depart and say our farewells, until next time.


I really want Lost Abbey to make it to Florida, if not in 2009, I can settle with 2010. If anyone is ever out their way, do not miss an opportunity to visit the brewery and to savor their brews. If youre lucky, or have amazing self-control, you may even be able to bring a few bottles home with you. Exquisitely delicious.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

S: I am in love. Wow this smells even better than bourbon. Tons of oak and vanilla right up front. I have had some hard to get highly regarded bourbons from little known Kentucky distillers that did not smell as nice as this one. Beneath the barrel is a nice complex brew. Nice tones of dark fruits, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and chocolate. Boy cant wait to taste this one.

T: Best barrel aged brew period. (Though to be honest I wont compare it to barrel aged stouts as its a whole different monster). The flavor is wonderful. This has the perfect amount of bourbon goodness without going overthetop at all. Tons of oak, vanilla, and whiskey. That being said the wonderful flavors of the ale Lost Abbey started with are not lost. Nice whiskey soaked dark fruits make an appearance. As does nutty toffee and burnt dark brown sugar. Soo complex and sooo good. Wonderful.

300,"2009-03-16",4.5,"2008 Release 12.7 oz bottle poured into a snifter - thanks to Jake65.  I have really been looking forward to The Angels Share... and it really did not disappoint... the hype surrounding this beer is proven to be true... I just dont know about the price tag.  I really dont think a 750ml bottle of Angels Share is worth $30... I would rather have $30 of other (better) beer than 1 bottle of Angels Share... but thats just me.  Having said that... this one is loaded with carbonation (as others have mentioned) and takes away from the beer for the first half of the glass.... huge 3 finger tan head which slowly came down a bit to 2 fingers - deep deep brown / light black in color.  A true beauty... needless to say.  Huge bourbon aromas seep out of the bottle and glass.  At first the carbonation really takes hold of the upper palate... letting the bourbon notes fill the mouth, while creating a thinner body.  As the beer warms and reaches the lower portion of the glass, the carbonation dissipates and The Angels Share becomes something much greater.  The body is stronger and more alive with flavors of deep dark fruits, some oak, lots of vanilla and of course bourbon.  A really strong finish completes this one with more bourbon and a slight alcohol burn.  I am so glad I got to have a bottle of this and look forward to having the Brandy Barrel version one day.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","craftbeerdesign"

Flavour is equally many-facetted, but somehow seems a bit more composed than the aroma. High sweetness with prunes, plums and raisins as its base. Then dryish oak and more sweet spices - vanilla, coriander. There is no hint of the alcohol anywhere except in the far finish, when it warms nicely. Here, the chocolate creeps up again.

The palatte and flavor are very heavy, but I think my tasting partner bullseyed it when he said that it smells slightly better than it tastes: the heaviness of the flavor gives the beer such concentrated direction as to almost be... lacking in depth.  Scotch, wood granules, massive roast and charcoal are what you feel and taste, but as much as this liquid oak is impressive, theres simply no room left for the beer, and this is why it couldnt hit higher scores for me.  I told nbutler11 that I dont think I will ever be in the mood to drink this beer as I dont see myself spiralling into depression in the near future though the thought of having to finish even a 375 of this myself brings me close.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"
300,"2009-01-15",4.3,"Rating #200.  Bottle from diggity7.  Pours black with brown edges, and a big creamy long lasting dark drown head. Aromas of booze, bourbon, wood, vanilla, caramel and a little more booze, which I dont seem to mind.  I also get some brown sugar and raisin.  Flavors are sweet malts, caramel, raisin, and alcohol.  Long finish, great body, but as we all know over carbonated.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","aplusbreaks"
300,"2009-01-12",4.4,"Thanks for sharing this with me bro.  I was a bit perplexed when I was smelling and tasting this.  I had no idea what style it was.  I thought it was an impy stout and was thinking it was meh.  Then my brother told me it was a barley wine and at that point, I was very impressed.  It pours out one of the deepest brown colors with light tannish head.  Aroma is intensely bourbon, caramel malt and mild chocolate and smoke.  Taste is vanilla, intense bourbon, caramel malt and light toffee.  Very smooth for the ABV and everything is well balanced.  Awesome stuff!!!","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"

2007 Bottle, Gold Lettering.

The bottle was a gusher but I poured quickly and let it set for a while.  The head was huge - large foamy off-white color that settles to a thin creamy off-white head with streams of lacing.  Aroma is sweet, oak, brandy, brown sugar, vanilla, and dark fruit.  Taste is amazingly smooth for being such high alcohol - caramel, vanilla, dark fruit.

300,"2009-01-12",4.7,"Pours a dark black with a slight reddish brown at the edges. Head is a medium tan color and the beer is overcarbonated enough to warrant an extremely slow pour.Smells like heaven. Hints of oak, maybe a slight boozy aroma. A bit of vanilla I think.Tastes like it smells. Well, sort of. Its better. Theres a slight bourbon flavor, which unlike a lot of beers, is very subdued and balanced with the other flavors of vanilla, oak, maybe some dark fruits, and a bit of caramel. Minimal amounts of alcohol are present in the taste. Very impressed.Mouthfeel is where I feel this beer suffers. Theres simply too much carbonation in here. Instead of feeling a syrupy thickness I feel a fizzy bubbling sensation. With as relatively thin as the beer is, I feel it would serve better with a heavier mouthfeel.However, I think that after you move past the beers somewhat fizzy nature, its very very drinkable. None of the flavors are overwhelming and always in balance. The only thing that would stop me from drinking more of this would be the lack of availability (I had to get this VIA trading) and the fact that the ABV would knock me onto my ass in a hurry. Especially because its so well hidden. I am very impressed with this beer as a whole. Most of the regular Lost Abbey brews Ive been unimpressed with, and with all the hyped up beers Ive tasted recently, this is one of a few that I feel lives up to its hype.",", Colorado, USA","SuperWhite92"
300,"2009-01-09",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2009 Bottle shared with CaryTheDude and JakeBra. Much was made of the the cork when it was opened,  The pour is very dark with a dark head. Looks excellent.

Not boozy in the least. Mouthfeel is so smooth. CaryTheDudess right, it isnt fair. This beer is too good. 

Re-rate: Draft at the Local Option. Dark, dark brown pour with a tan ring around the head.   Nice to try this again and not have to suffer through a flat bottle.  Aroma of bourbon and toffee, rum soaked fruit.  Dark Chocolate.  Smooth bourbon on top of a fruity, deep body.   This is a lovely beer, its a shame they had so many problems with it in the bottles.

300,"2009-01-09",4.0,"375 ml bottle.  After a very loud pop o the cork I got a dark mahogany body with a large fizzy dark brown head that faded to a thin covering.  Lots of heavy lacing, light visible carbonation.  Very big nose thats really well balanced between the malt and the bourbon barrel.  Rich fruits and heavy toffee with some light roast competes with the bourbon, vanilla, and oak.  A little oxidation maybe, Very well integrated flavor.  I love the flavor, the heavy maltiness combines with the oak and vanilla flavors so well.  Such a big beer, but not boozy in the slightest.  Toffee, tobacco, great dry oakiness, and no real alcohol flavor or heat.  Some chocolate and coffee, figs, maybe some dates, on the finish.  The initial mouthfeel is rather annoying though.  If this werent so damn fizzy and prickly it would be great.  Once you get past that initial burst of carbonation the body is sufficiently thick and hearty.  This was just incredibly delicious.  Took me over an hour of letting it breathe enough to calm down the carbonation with constant swirling, but after that it was excellent.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Oh yeah. Mouthfeel initially just kind of average with a bit of fizziness/light prickliness that detracts a bit but eventually settles out to a warmer, smoother palate, becoming lightly silky. Fairly sticky esp. in finish. Some light fine rings of lacing and a syrupy film inside snifter. Flavor of caramelized sugar, raisin, roast, molasses and a touch of bourbon.

300,"2008-12-11",3.5,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2011 On TAP at Brouwers Big Wood 08. Pours dark  as black as a stout  with a great off-white head. DEEP aroma  a ton of malts, reminds me of something breakfasty  a deep, roasty maple syrup, maybe. Bourbon. Oak. The flavor is just huge  it explodes when it hits your tongue unlike anything else Ive had. Incredibly thick, but still clean and dry. I still think its a bit too sweet, and Id love to try something like this that has a bit better balance. Theres a roastiness that comes through at the end. This is about as full-bodied as it is possible to make a beer. Points for novelty. RERATE 03/20/10 at Brouwers Hard Liver 2010. I still definitely enjoy the bourbon version better, but Angels has really worn on me - its just too hot, and too much of a palate bomb for my liking anymore. Dropping a point from this one in both palate and overall categories. RERATE 03/05/11: I have to knock a few more points off this one. Its just simply too boozy, and for whatever reason, I *feel* this one more than I do any other beer. Every time I have one, Im done... which doesnt happen after a World Wide Stout, so something is awry. Im to the point where the novelty of Angels Share has disappeared, and Im just no longer a fan. I can appreciate the complexity, but Im over it.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

Dark, sweet, malt notes again in the flavor along with a soft smokiness, molasses, and brown sugar.  There is caramel and woodinessas well alongside pleasant aged and oxidized characteristics with a very slight bitter tartness in the finish.  The body is full, but oddly light-feeling. This is in contrast to the big, dense body with heavy thickness on the palate that one might expect from a beer of this type.

Flavor is woody and bourbon dominant with hefty doses of vanilla, brown sugar, and vinous fruits.  Feel is nice with a slight sting and woody thickness.

300,"2008-08-27",4.0,"We tried both Angels Share blind during a tasting and just guessing which is which was already a challenge. Surprisingly, the Bourbon one came out as my favourite of the two. Basically, it felt less alcoholic to me and also seemed tighter in its aromas, with more of the pleasant vanilla overtones. Both remain quite similar, very complex and integrated barley wines with endless dessert malt and fruit layers all the while not being fatiguing with its high sweetness. The body also felt a bit tighter, not necessarily rounder, but less oily in the bourbon one.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Eh, I think I would have rather have a bottle of something else in hind sight.  I really like the brandy barrel edition as I find it to be perfectly blended, with the barrel not being too obvious.  The appearance and all of the subtle flavors of the other edition are all here - with the exception of this one being really hot from the bourbon barrel.  Over powering bourbon flavor, strong bourbon aroma, bleh.  This beer is way over rated.  The other one is deserving, this one isn’t near in the same league.  Woulda rather had an old viscosity than this.  Very glad I did not get in the club and pay 30 bucks for this.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

300,"2008-08-24",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 5, 2010 My Bottom Line:
This ever-so-succulent malt paradise of a Barley Wine graces the tongue with eloquent caramel, anisey bourbon, vanilla and port-like grapey wealth, hypnotizing and beguiling each tastebud at every single sip.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A bubbly head of foam laces around the burgundy-smeared dark brown.
-Alcohol is quite present in the flavor profile, which might be this beers only drawback, imho.
-Carbonation in these bottles was slightly stronger than in the 2006 Angels Share regular release.
-Some roastiness is tasted in the back, alongside alcohol trails and wooden dryness.
-The barrel character in this was as flawlessly integrated as the brandy barrel is in the regular version.
-Some smokiness is hallucinated in the aroma.
-I would love to compare this brew to Hakusekikans Super Vintage Ale. I have a feeling these are cousins...

A little more carbonated than the sample I had at the brewery. The hops have faded some, bringing more malt and bourbon notes to the forefront. Bourbon notes are very strong.

Huge oak, (massive wood?) rich malt, chocolate, slight peaty earthy notes and some stunning pina colada notes from the coconut infusion from the barrel. Absolutely stunning mouthfeel.

Superb beer.Re-rate of one of the flat ""undrinkable"" bottles. If anything this is even better. Ive just upped the aroma to a ten from a nine. The most amazing burnt caramel I have ever sniffed at. The lack of carbonation only serves to make it more drinkable and if anything it lets the amazing flavours sing even more. The sourness is more pronounced. The fruity malt is much better.

Aromas all over the map with notes of vanilla, raisins, chocolate (milk and dark both come to mind), strong oak, caramel and toffee.  Seemed a slightly mild aroma when I first had it, but the second time I had it, it smelled fantastic.  Flavor is equally demanding; bitter dark chocolate, raisins, strong oak mixing with sweet bourbon, vanilla and a woodlike bitterness.  Quite sweet, but its too complex to call ""sugary.""  Finish dries things out with a bitter buttery hop flavor, lingering toasted wood, bourbon, and bitter raisin/dark fruit.  Wonderful aftertaste goes on and on.  High Belgian-esque carbonation makes this drinkable and easy going, but its got a full body and TONS of flavor.  I expected this to be good and man, this is a wondeful beer!

300,"2008-07-09",4.4,"Truly a great beer. Have had this a number of times and figured I ought to actually put in a review.

Pours a thick, dark brown with a 2 finger tan head that is creamy and never fully dies (that, and the bottles really are over carbonated).

Smells of vanilla infused bourbon, sweet caramel/toffee and some funky dried fruits/dates. Nice.

The taste is quite similar to the smell. There is a healthy dose of vanilla bourbon that, while strong, lends itself nicely to this beer. The caramel/toffee sweetness is most definitely there in the form of a massive malt body to back up that bourbon (nice to see this after having had many bourbon beers where the malts just cant stand up to the bourbon). The alcohol is present, no question, most likely from the bourbon aging. This, however, is not an impediment with this beer. Dates and other similar candied fruit sort of flavors also float around in the background. Some oak presence. This beer just hits all the right spots.

Mouthfeel is very rich, overly carbonated at first (give it some time to settle and it is much more divine) and satisfying.

While this is a sipper for sure, I am always sad once my glass hits empty with a beer like this. As such, I cannot rate the drinkability any less than excellent.

Highly recommended. This is still a favorite beer of mine. With that said, here is how I rank the current Angels Share editions:
06 Bourbon > 06 Brandy > 07 Bourbon > 07 Brandy.
06 Bourbon was on tap for the Toronado BW fest and blew most everything else away. The other 3 Ive had side by side a couple of times, and the ranking seems to stay the same.","USA","rallison"

Smell is wonderfully sweet with brown sugar and caramel. There is a definite boozy bourbon aroma as well but extremely well integrated with the sweetness of the malts. I actually also got the slightest hint of sour in the nose at the finish.  As much as I would like to ""buck the hype"", this is one of the best tasting beers I have ever tasted. It’s wonderfully creamy with molasses and caramel up front with the bready malts. The bourbon is present but very subtle and plays with the sweet vanilla tastes and dark fruits. In a word, spectacular.  As mentioned before, for a bourbon barrel beer this one is incredibly smooth and creamy yet highly carbonated. The bubbles just tingle the tongue...so, so good.

300,"2008-06-11",3.5,"375 ml bottle corked and caged from Lost Abbey Patron Sinners club.  Cork opens with a loud pop, and some ""smoke"".  Pour is deep brown, some ruby highlight.  There is an expansive four inch tan head, which is quite lasting.  Nice lacing left behind as it slowly retreats.  Pretty pour.  Aroma is bourbon oak wood barrel, vanilla and some pepper spiciness.  Behind that is some smoked maltiness.  It was hard to get past the Bourbon on the nose, that was most of what I smelled.  Taste is a nice malty Barley wine, toasted vanilla, a bit of pine hops, then a pretty big dose of the Bourbon.  I also get some cola taste in this as well. Makers and Coke?  There is some graininess mid-palate.  The finish is boozy, and quite sharp.  Palate is right for the beer, not overly big, but sufficiently full to support the big flavors.  The oak in the beer made this beer very drying.   Later that evening, my mouth was so dry I felt like I had been sucking on wood chips.  This beer was good, but seemed dominated by the Bourbon, and as such, became a bit one dimensional for me.  As this approached room temperature things integrated a bit better, or my palate had been overwhelmed, either way it improved. I had high expectations for this beer, and was hoping for a bit more complexity.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

300,"2008-06-03",4.3,"375ml bottle from the Sinners Club. A vigorous pour, dark brown to burgundy, with a fast rising but quickly diminishing head. Crisp carbonation makes the complex nose even more rich, with not only a nice balanced wood and bourbon aroma but a subtle, vinous character thats extremely appealing. Hard to ignore the nutty aroma and flavors in there too, a nod to the glories of the English style. It all blends together sumptuously. There are lovely hops in there, making the barrel presence light rather than syrupy and cloying. The malts are also not too sweet, but just there to add depth. Dark fruits and bourbon mellow out into something with a full, smooth mouthfeel but with a liveliness and zest that you wouldnt ordinarily expect. So much going on with this beer. Its truly awesome and Ill be very curious to see how it ages.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

300,"2008-05-13",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2008 375 ml bottle from the Patron Sinners release.  When I pulled the cork it nearly took my arm through the ceiling.  The gush followed a few seconds later.  The pour is very dark brown with some garnet highlights.  A very Coca-Cola-esque head to begin with.  It eventually settled out to a dark tan ring with some wisps in the middle, and some lace.  Boozey bourbon alcohol vapors attack the nostrils.  Underneath that you certainly find a pleasant chocolate/caramel character.  Here come an aggressive oak character just got me.  The flavor seems a bit more balanced.  Most of the same flavor.  Bourbon is still in the lead.  A nice blend of chocolate and oak.  I also get a bit more smoke and tobacco character.  Levi Garrett anyone?  A little bit of cocoa powder in the finish.  Medium/light body.  High, aggressive carbonation which is sort of a put off for me.  Dry warm finish.  I am certainly glad for the chance to try this bottle of beer.  This may just be a bit too bold for me, I guess.  It drinks more like a spirit than beer.

300,"2008-05-03",5.0,"First of all, I am amazed at how many people have sampled this one.  Secondly, my methods of procurement will remain a closely guarded secret.  Thirdly, I sincerely hope that all eBay prospectors die in a fire.  On to my review:

Pour:  Hazy deep brown with huge 4-finger tan head, a gigantic cork pop, and lacing that sticks more than a Freshman college chick dating a senior linebacker.

Nose:  Oaky, plummy malt, brown sugar, spicy yeast, mild hops, bourbon, port, blackberry

Flavor:  Initially oaky malty and caramelly, with plummy, blackberry, port, brown sugar, fig, mild cacao, but not tasting sweet, rather as a very well balanced oaky boubony beverage with the added brown sugary, malty, fig, and cognacy notes as subtle additions, and not as entitites overtaking the beer.  

Palate/Overall:  The palate was as complex as Ive ever quaffed, with intermingling flavors and an amazing balance.  As I poured the last dregs of this, I briefly considered going onto eBay for another, but then I regained my ratebeer confidence and realized that I will never become one of those bottom-feeding scumbags, and I remembered that with the proper where-with-alll, I would see this one again.   Still, if that is too optimistic, then I will see this beer in my dreams, right next to Christy Canyon.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
300,"2008-05-01",4.3,"Bottle sent to me by one of SoCal finest ratebeerians, Jon (WeeHeavySD), mucho thanks bro!  A deep brown with russet hues topped by a surprising frothy head which left good lace upon my Duval snifter, I expected little head from this beer honestly. Some oily legs as well with a swirl of the glass. The aroma has a big kick your ass Bourbon character at first.  Lots of oak, vanilla, charcoal, molasses, fig, heavy brown sugar, aromatic pipe tobacco, star anise and a leafy peaty earthy yeasty ester... yes, quite the run on sentence but so what.  The taste profile opens with a heavy amount of malt and sugar overtones with a nice supportive twangy fruit background. Much like the other Angel Share, this has some strong port like characteristics but seemed to be more tannic and charred, therefore a tad rougher around the edges. The finish has a splash of vanilla and rye-like malt, slightly smoky and peaty too which rocks. With some age and a reduction of the somewhat aggressive booze, the finish could become glorious. The mouth feel is lush and sharp at the same time with each sip a slightly different experience. I do seem to enjoy the brandy barrel version more, however I see this one aging better. Either way, I could do a lot worse that to sip and enjoy these treats from the hands of Tomme Arthur.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

375 bottle. Quite a bit different than the brandy barrel release. More tart fruit notes. More wet wood presence and surprisingly less alcohol. Vanilla and a non abrasive bourbon hotness. Tart fruit skin. Pours dark, rich ruby/brown with a sustained thin khaki head. Flavor is dominated by tart fruit and toffee malt. Big barrel presence, but doesnt compliment the beer quite as much as the brandy barrel. Almost too much carbonation for this style of beer.

300,"2008-04-23",4.6,"Let me first say that at first I really wanted to not like this beer. Something about this whole frequent special releases thing kind of rubs me the wrong way for some reason.

A- I have to say this looks just about perfect. Very dark brown, almost black with a creamy, tan head that leaves quite a bit of lacing as it falls.

S- Smell is very enticing, sweet, brown sugar, spices, almost detect a sour note towards the end, slight coffee, a bit of bourbon.

T- Taste is much different than I was suspecting from the smell. Tastes creamy, mixed spices in the middle, sweet cream, a slight bit of bourbon. Can detect the alcohol warming but it blends in so superbly. The sweetness wears on you after a while. Definitely a sipper.

M- A bit thinner than I would have guessed, very crisp with a lot of carbonation. Refreshing, Im a little tired of beers that are way too thick, this is excellent.

D- I really really wanted to not like this beer. I tried to find as much wrong with it as I could but I just couldnt. Not a huge fan of the brewery, didnt buy into the hype and I loved it. Try to get a bottle now why there is still some in circulation, you wont regret it.","California, USA","Lothore"

(notes get sparse at this point!) as far as the flavor... well, it is more refined and smarter than i. its a complex mix of oak, vanilla, dark fruit, a little molasses, chocolate again, wood and a peppery dry woody finish. everything is in perfect balance. the bourbon does nothing to get in the way but rather plays a secondary role to help coalesce  an amazing experience. insanely drinkable if it werent for the price tag...","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"

Dense brown hue with huge billowing head that eventually dies down to a thin layer. Smell dominated by oak, vanilla, caramel, sweet malts, and light bourbon. Delicious and rich initial taste profile of molasses, oak, caramel malts, and maple syrup opens up quickly to a whiskey alcohol burn and vanilla. Finishes syrupy sweet and drying. Thick chewy texture and prickly carbonation.

300,"2008-04-20",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2009 Rating based on a collection of notes from multiple samples. This is the way that barrel-aging should be done. The original Angels Share (brandy) came off as overly boozy and much more of a liquor than as a beer. Bourbon Barrel Angels Share is so much more balanced, smooth and creamy without the intensity that the standard release has. The beer in itself is a bit on the sweet side, but with a beautiful presentation of molasses, vanilla, and oak over a beautiful malty backbone.","California, USA","KAME"
300,"2008-04-20",4.1,"Thanks to Michael for the bottle!  Youre going to want to chill this more than I did before opening.. explosive cork and a bit of a mess on the table, but all was well.  Poured deep, seductive brown with a well-retained cap of oaky-tan head.  The aroma picked up a fresh burst of oak and vanilla with dark, sweet bourbon sugars not far behind.. deeper yet, rich aged caramel and molasses join in.. right at the very back the alcohol prickles the nose hairs.. I loved the way this was layered in its presentation.  Caramel and molasses roll over the tongue, trailed closely by a vibrant hit of whiskey.. the middle was a tad messy with the whiskey still trying to steal the show, repressing the vanilla, caramel, and molasses.. oak plays a huge role in drying out the edges and the back.. a bunch of whiskey and molasses on the long, memorable finish.  Heavier-bodied, but somewhat slick on the palate with a dry finish.. the balance could have been better at times when the whiskey took off.

300,"2008-04-18",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2013 375ml bottle.  I had this in the truck for about 5 hours but let it settle for a couple when I got home because I know how much the Lost Abbey yeast can negatively affect the beer.  Lets just say its one of the many reasons Im not such a huge fan of this brewery.  They do have some winners, though, namely the Brandy Barrel Angels Share, which I absolutely love.  So on to the rating... out of the bottle its foaming and overcarbonated and lands in the glass under about twelve feet of thick brown foam.  Okay, I can wait.  The nose is primarily semi-sweet bourbon, complete with the maple and vanilla that seems to be the norm in bourbon aged strong ales or barley wines, something that doesnt come through so dominating as with a stout or porter due to the roast and chocolate.  But this one smells nice enough, with some spicy charred malt, some boozy alcohol, some barrel tannins and some tobacco/plum/date/nut notes, which is pretty nice but doesnt impress me as much as the brandy barrel version.  Texture is overcarbonated but sticky, with a resinous nut and dried, spiced plum flavor thats most prominent.  The finish has a hint of alcohol, not completely transparent but not overpowering at all, and as a whole it comes off heavy with the nut character.  Theres some sweet maple-flavored bourbon for sure, and also some peppery wood and graham cracker flavors hidden a little deeper. Overall its a fine beer, has a lot going for it, especially the dried nuts and wood, but it doesnt measure up to the brandy barrel version, but then Im a whore for brandy and wine barrel barley wines (bourbon belongs with stout, brand and wine with barley wine).  Quite good, but dare I say overrated a bit?","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Aroma brings the finer elements of bourbon, straining away the excess with ease; apple cider, toasted coconut, candied almond, honey and vanilla, and rum flambeed raisins.  Sophistication just wafts from it in a heavy, sweet haze.  Flavors of apple cider vinegar, raisins, cocoa nibs, raspberry liqueur, sweet campfire smoke, plums, and caramel.  Palate is at once thick and sprightly; finely tuned and balanced, decadent but subtle; sweet finish showing powdered sugar, maple pecans, and burnt caramel.  Very soft and pleasant throughout, never bombastic in any way.  A beautifully made example of bourbon barrel aging.  Thanks for sharing, Brad!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Anyway, pours a dark brown with a great thick brown head. The aroma was mostly bourbon, also some vanilla and wood. The taste was also full of so much bourbon, with some vanilla and caramel.

300,"2008-04-05",3.4,"2008 bottle release; Sampled April 2008
Wow, Bourbon Barrel Angels Share is a gusher, I lost something less than a quarter bottle, even though the bottle was at 48°F / 9°C.  A careful pour yields an over-flowing six-finger thick, darkened tan colored head.  The beer is a deeply burnt, amber color, and shows a hint of concentrated ruby if held up directly to the light.  Rich caramelized malt notes are immediately proceeded by Bourbon barrel notes of vanillin, spicy oak / Bourbon and some buttery oak character.  The barrel / Bourbon notes are fairly restrained, but still are perhaps the most noticeable character in the aroma.  As my nose gets used to the beer, the butterscotch / butter barrel notes become more apparent as does a warming alcohol aroma.  Even a touch of mustiness seems to lurk in the background.  The Bourbon barrel character actually gets a bit sharp, even harsh at times, but for the most part the nose remains deeply caramel infused, smooth bourbon barrel character. 

It has been ten minutes since pouring this beer and it is still quite well carbonated; a quick swirl of my glass releases the excess CO2 though.  Sweet and deeply caramelized with malt induced flavors of toffee and raisins.  Starting in the middle a toasty, brown malt character kicks in and provides a touch of dryness, though not enough to offset the lingering, rich, complex, malt sweetness that just sticks to the palate.  Quite a bit lighter than one might expect from a beer that is 12.5% abv; it does have some heft to it as it is certainly a sipping beer, but it definitely has a light feel to it and at times can seem a bit thin.  The Bourbon barrel character is quite a bit softer than it was in the aroma.  Typical flavors of spicy oak, vanillin and buttery oak (this last more so in the finish) are found here and the Bourbon provides some alcohol heat.  Somehow the beer actually tastes a bit vinous to me; a mix of port, sherry and a full bodied Sancerre.  The finish is spicy and sharp with hot Bourbon notes (though not overwhelmingly so).

Somehow not nearly as well integrated, nor nearly so tasty as the 2006 Brandy version (I have yet to try the 2007).  I could see this getting close, but somehow the base beer has changed too much while residing in the barrel.  I wonder if the changed flavor, lightened body, along with the gushing, is caused by a slight infection?  If so it is not so much as to drastically effect things or even be overtly noticeable, but this beer is just enough off to keep it from being great.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Appearance: opens with a loud pop and a quick gush, solid black, creamy tan head that stirs up big and thick on demand, thick sudsy lace
Aroma: bourbon and chocolate aroma with lots of vanilla sweetness and a hint of peppery alcohol, eventually some sweet dark caramel shows up, aroma is too faint for a beer this big
Body: huge thick and creamy body
Flavor: rich chocolate flavor, nice dark caramel sweetness blends with the whisky and vanilla to give it a candy quality, touch of ripe dark fruit, the sweetness continues to pull out the richness of the chocolate, just a hint of oak adds complexity rather than balance as the beer is already quite balanced by the rich array of flavors
Overall: I did not think it was possible to beat the original brandy barrel version, I was wrong

The flavor integrates the nose very well, with more vanilla, toffee/caramel, dark fruits, bourbon and oak.  The bourbon is well integrated and not overly done.  Only slight warming, otherwise the alcohol is well hidden.  The only notable detraction is that its a bit over carbonated right now.

Ar: Bourbon, Oak/Wood, caramel with  slight vanilla. I cant keep my nose away from this beer. Slightly sour/barrel smell.
Ap: Popped cork and the beer bubbled up ( I heared this was the case for many others). Thick tan head, second pour was more creamy than the first. Coffee colored.

I would like to say its full bodied, but its not. Medium body, a little overcarbonated, in my opinion.","San Diego, California, USA","doubleo"
300,"2008-02-28",4.4,"Tap at EBF 08.  Pours the same as Brandy AS- deep murky woody brown with ruby highlights and a thin beige head.  Aroma is syrupy sticky sweet with tons of dried fruits, raisin, plum, some apple, figs, along with sharp dark crystal malts- caramel- toffee and some light tar and chocolate- while as it warms the modest bourbon comes in - perhaps a bit stronger in character than the Brandy version.  Flavor is strong, full, and syrupy like the original, has all the full malty character- fruity esters, figs, dates and smooth woody oaky bourbon- light maple syrup hints with lots of fruity dark sharp malts and malt syrup.  Velvety smooth on the palate with a nice lingering woody bourbon character and some warming action from the alcohol.

Somewhat fruity, light bourbon aromas are present to start.  Unfortunately, there is a definite ethanol presence in the nose.  A bit of vinousness is present, too.  Moderately hazy ruddy amber body with an oily, light tan/orange head.  Fair lacing.  Attractive stuff.  Starts a bit sweet before some bourbon flavors make a presence.  Becomes vinous, roasty, malty, caramelly in the middle.  Finishes with a lightly bitter hoppiness.  Smooth, velvety, warming, extremely drinkable.

Pulled from the cask a dark brown with some redish hues. Thick and cream head fill my plastic taster glass.  Aroma of cherries, oak and bourbon. Flavor was very rich with rasins and dates. A very bourbony finish, with alcohol warming and sharpness, but without a harsh flavor.  I tired it with a friend whom I recently shared some Westy with, and we both agreed this blew it out fo the water. Easily the best thingk Ive ever had.","san diego, California, USA","bikesandbeers"
300,"2007-05-16",4.5,"5/5/07.  On cask at Lost Abbey 1st Anniversary Party in San Marcos, CA 5/5/07.  Cask!  Muddy dark brown color with a creamy tan ""malt ball"" Whopper-like spongy head that is amazingly well retained.  Despite this and the well-integrated carbonation that lasts way longer than it has any right to, I still cursed the use of the sparkler they served it through.  A beer this intricately nuanced certainly deserves better.  But otherwise this cask was in peak condition.  Aroma is wildly different from the regular Angels Share, with a succulently fruity cherry-bourbon medley and other assorted dark fruits, like candied figs and bourbon-drizzled dates (yes, THAT decadent).  The sweetness is apparent but wonderfully checked by the bright cherry-like fruitiness, a raw wood hum and the gentle warmth of fine bourbon.  The lone downfall is a shade too much bourbon, but this is markedly different from your sleazy TGIFridays well shit.  The bourbon has a softness to it that keeps it from taking over, and allows the base beer to show a whole different expression than the brandy barrels will allow.  The flavor is incredibly wonderfully malted, mostly of molasses, dates, and hints of sweet tobacco.  Rich vanilla and still some striking fruity wood notes.  But once again the bourbon leaves a little too much heat behind, masking some of the subtlety even as it ramps up the complexity.  Its a trifle of a complaint, but it sadly keeps this from being completely out-of-this-world.  Full body with a warm woody texture and lovely dry caramelized sugar in the finish.  Long, great malt depth.  A surprising improvement on an already outstanding beer.  I cant wait until they release this in bottles.  If the bourbon intensity can mellow out a bit with extended age (and Im not really talking about alcohol heat-- moreso just intense bourbon FLAVOR), this beer could be simply incredible.  As it is, its damn close.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
300,"2007-05-10",4.6,"Cask during the Port 1st Anniv Party.  Wow what a great beer.  Definitely on par with the original Angels Share.  Lots of oak aromas and flavors to compliment all the dark fruit and molasses.  Hints of bourbon too.  Great stuff.","Santee/San Diego, California, USA","fordest"

I tried the spectacular bourbon barrel aged Angels Share beer today at Lost Abbeys anniversary tasting.  Wow!  Probably the best beer Ive ever had.  Sweet creamy head.  Deep rich color.  Nice bourbon aftertaste.    Nice malty smell at the bottom of the glass.  People tell you to rate the smell first, before your smell sensors are saturated, but i think you should wait until the end, where the temperature has raised and the glass is filled with aroma.  First taste, and i would say a touch more sweetness.  Second tasting, and a touch less. Hmmm.  just an incredible beer.   I think they open a bottle once a week at the tasting room.

300,"2007-05-07",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2013 On cask at the brewery. Aroma perks forth with suave, sleek grandeur enticing in so many fruits, rich nuttiness and bold gout-inducing richness. Sprightly. Out of the hand engine, the beer comes as a ruddy hued mahogany, clouded with a fine, silky smooth cream head in tobacco tinted cloud. Flavor is redolent with extravagent creamed malts, mature sugar density and a whole pantheon of nuts, fruits, chocolate, nips of tobacco and fragrant plums. Texture completely sublime, the cask presentation hightening the sickening drinkability of a beer so hefty. The bourbon smoothes corners, draws deep breaths of moist woodiness and clean nut-dry parching quality. More rounded and deep than the Brandy-barrel version and it shows.

300,"2007-05-07",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2008 Read below for my initial review.  I braved the line.  I stood around until my back and feet were giving out on me and, finally, I set foot on the carpet so the beer princess could sell me an ale of the same stuff I stood in line for all morning.  She brought me back a delicious glass of this ale.  It hit on all notes and was as advertised, but I did make a mental note... this was not nearly as good as Angels Share 001.  But I enjoyed my glass of beer, bought a solid case and called it a day.  Now Ive finally been able to crack a few of these grossly overpriced bottle and 3 out of 3 shot foam.  I deal with it.  It doesnt taste as good as the stuff I had on tap that day.  Im not even sure if its the same beer.  The pour is an event.  You have to somehow defeat the overcarbonation.  Slow.  The taste, well, ho-hum.  Still not as good as the first batch. Definite barrel flavor, but Ill take the regular big bottle offering over this stuff.  It sits at 100 due to its rarity and thats all.  Ill take an Oak Aged Yeti over this any day.

WOW!  As if The Angels Share could get any better!  Jumpin christ on pixie dust is this stuff ever delicious.  Flavor profile off the charts.  You taste it all.  The wood, the whiskey, the barley wine.  A delicious slap in the face.","La Mesa, California, USA","Bartzilla"

Heavy bourbon nose off the head, with lots of thick roasty malts and raisins.  Very dark with a beautiful creamy beige head that lasted throughout each glass. The appearance almost reminded me of a tap Older Viscosity. Each sip only got better as it warmed. Flavor is incredibly complex, loaded with caramel, vanilla, raisin, figs, black cherries with a very well balanced finish of hops and warming bourbon & alcohol. No one flavor dominated over another, each component and its concentration within the brew was put together very well. Velvety-smooth and chewy mouth feel, like warm bread towards the end with the presence of oak. Absolutely fantastic! Everything was perfect, the balance in this creation was highly impressive. Just shy of a 5 because I would really like to have experienced it from a proper serving glass, not a plastic taster. Now THIS IS BEER ! ! !","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"

300,"2007-05-06",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2008 On cask at the brewery.  Tried several samples at the first anniversary party.  Im so glad I thought to bring a real tasting glass in order to gain a full appreciation of this one; it was certainly worth the extra attention.  Pours a dark, semi-opaque red cedar bark brown color with a frothy layer of creamy tan head.  Aroma is dripping with dark fruits - prunes, raisins, and figs, and is softened and sweetened by a silky wave of sweet caramels and lots of vanilla bean.  The bourbon character is really the perfect compliment for the beer, as the slightly drier oak character of the bourbon barrel seems to work perfectly with the beer.  While there is an increased oak presence compared to the brandy barrel version, the barrel character still holds itself very much in check with the overall balance of the nose, allowing the terrific, sweet malt complexities shine through on the center stage.  A little bit of caramelly bourbon reveals itself to the nose, but is sufficiently subdued to leave but a gentle warming glow in the nostrils.  Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel - this beer lends itself to the cask amazingly well.  Loads of freshly picked, black cherries instantly flood the tongue, backed by an aggressively flavorful blend of raisins and lightly spiced fig.  Tons of heavenly malt sweetness thats complex and far from cloying; the light creaminess of the body simply makes this one dance across the tongue.  Some fresh, woody maple syrup, clover honey, and lots and lots of vanilla bean enhance the dark fruity base.  A little bit of dry oakiness lingers in the finish along with some warming bourbon, although while not hot, is pretty much the only less-than-perfect trait this brew has.  Honestly, was it possible for this one to be a disappointment?  No.  Is it possible that this one even surpasses the brandy barrels greatness?  Hopefully someday there will be bottles to do a just side-by-side comparison.  Fantastic.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
