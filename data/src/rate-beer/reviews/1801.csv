Taste of is bourbon dominated boozey, licorice, thick palate, mild chocolate malts. So this is my 2nd barrel aged beer from cycle and again Im not impressed.

Aroma is malts, cocoa, only lightly bourbon, hint of molasses. Taste malts, bourbon, molasses, light cocoa, chocolate, sweet chocolaty hints, but a nice suitable bourbon sweet-bitter finish. --Dont get why this is a baltic porter, I mean, at 10% ABV this doesnt really suit the general baltic porters right? It also tastes like an Imperial Porter or Imperial Stout (whats the difference?), so baltic porter? I dont care, I dont mind, Im not bothered by it, but I dont agree. -- Superb beer though, delicious!","Oirschot, THE NETHERLANDS, NETHERLANDS","Benzai"

1801,"2016-08-20",4.1,"22 ounces bottle from trade with Jason. Aroma: great intense cocoa, licorice, light roasted, strong woody alcohol on the background. App: pitch black, small to minimal brown head, little lacing. Taste and palate: medium body, light to medium sweetness liquoreux, soft but tingling feeling on the tongue, alcohol with subtle acidity finish. Overall: awesome. Love the aroma of this one. All in finest. Great palate, love the subtle acidity and strong (Whisky?) alcohol finish. This feels like a beer that was already aged. Feels a bit oxydated but in a good way. Could be a tad less ""fizzy"". Well its not fizzy but something makes my tongue feels like its numb, not that unpleasant but not particularly pleasant. I would sure gave given more points without that feeling. Nonetheless this is really good.","St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Stoned99"
