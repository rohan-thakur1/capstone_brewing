2208,"2017-01-11",3.4,"0,5l bottle at home courtesy of Saeglopur, big thanks. BB 07.02.2017. clear golden shiny color, small white head. smells doughy, fruity, tobacco, ripe fruits. overall nice smell. medium body, bubbly carbonation, slick mouthfeel. tastes of bread, doughy, lightly citric, tobacco, light caramel, bit peppery, spices. finishes lightly sweet with notes of dough, tobacco and spices. quite good one, very smooth drinking, the bubbly carbonation makes this more exciting that it probably would be without. I didnt expect much because the style usually doesnt hold up in bottle but this one is nicely drinkable. excited to revisit this on tap in Salzburg.","Vienna, AUSTRIA","Werckmeister"
2208,"2016-10-26",3.2,"500 ml bottle. Deep clear golden colour, the small head is quickly vanishing, low lacing, soft carbonation. Nose is sweet malty. Pleasant mouthfeel, taste is well balanced between sweetish malt and hop, hints of honey. Finish has a light but pleasant bitterness. A good and very drinkable beer, but not outstanding. Had the same draught in the brewpub and found it much better there, maybe because of the unique atmosphere at Stockhammer Saal.","Graz, AUSTRIA","Olorin"
2208,"2016-10-23",4.2,"A 1L ceramic stein poured from the barrel at the monastery, consumed under leafy chestnut trees on a sunny autumn afternoon in the beautiful biergarten. Voluminous creamy white head atop a cloudy dark amber beer. Bready and banana aromas. Taste has a fresh bready maltiness, caramel sweetness, banana and other estery fruitiness, light floral and spicy hoppiness. What really stands out and elevates this beer, however, is the very slight lactic sour tang, likely from the barrel. This, combined with the very light body, makes it eminently drinkable and perfect for quenching thirst on a sunny Salzburg afternoon.","AUSTRALIA","Shark_Pants"

A white sudsy head comes up and a bit over the rim, adding unnecessary encouragement to take a sip immediately. Golden, clear liquid underneath the rapidly diminishing head.
A fine aroma of malt and baked bread with a touch of hops and a hint of alcohol.
The taste is similar, although the hops are much more present, even from the start, and become dominant by the finish. Nonetheless, theres a good bit of toasted malt flavor in the finish.

The head quickly fades and leaves what appears to be a copper colored beer. I thought it was more of a kellerbier than marzen, but either way, this is good, helped in no small part by the ambiance of the beer garden. Light caramel flavor, but also hops in the aroma.

Theres also a very subtle grassy hop bitterness present  but only slightly  giving this brew an amazing sense of balance.

Over a self provided meal of fruits, excellent cheese from the market in Salzburg, bread, and those paper thin radish like things they sell @ the pub.

Lots of fresh bread notes and some yeast. Earth flavours, and some herbs.  Taste is rather a mouthful. Chewy, full bodied  malt and sweet bread. Slight hop bite and again the bread notes are ever present. One finds themselves full after a round of these...or at least I did. But I kept on.

Poured by burly Austrian gentleman with unilateral eyelid ptosis at the Braustubl into a cool, ceramic krug directly from wooden cask. Overflowing with foamy white head and apparently golden straw-colored. Smell is light floral/fruity hops, sub-acid fruits and and sweet bread. Taste is yeast, apples, lemon tarts, sweet grass, light cinnamon, with a finish that was paradoxically both smooth and clean/crisp simultaneously. I dont know if it was the cask conditioning or the ceramic krug but something imparted a velvety, subtle effervescence to this beer that was incredibly enjoyable.

2208,"2009-01-09",3.1,"UPDATED: JAN 18, 2009 My Bottom Line:
This unfiltered Märzens soft flavor profile is made of tame cereals and polite herbal hoppiness, but its drinkability is optimal and its balance crafty.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A decent head of foam stays atop the krug. It looks light blond in there.
-This was freshly served was a newly-tapped gravity keg.
-It lacks malt character, and it thus has a lot of mass appeal.
-It is a tad watery at times.
-The mouthfeel is lean and softly carbonated. This is absurdly drinkable!
-Light herbal hop bitterness tickles the tongue.
