This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a ruddy burnt dark amber color with a two finger white foamy head that dissipated at a fair pace. Sticky speckled lace.
The aroma glistens with caramel and toffee malt, some ash and vanilla. Dark fruits. Grassiness. Sweet side of licorice. Earthiness.
The flavor definitely leans towards the sweet side touching the earthiness nicely. Dark fruits again. Some grassiness in the taste. Tobacco/earthy to vanilla and malty aftertaste. Wet vanilla sort of lenient tobacco dry finish.
On the palate, this one sat roughly at a a medium on the body keeping some sipping quality sliding over my tongue with a nice becoming smoothness. Barely any carbonation felt right now. ABV seems just a touch under than projected by the brewer.
Overall, cellared beer review for this one and it came out on top. Guess I pulled it out at the right time for a nice snowy cold New England night.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Smell: Slightly bitter, dried fruit aroma.

Taste: Rich & full-bodied, smooth & creamy, more fruit (berries?) & slight bitterness

Mouthfeel: Alcohol is felt but very pleasant. Feels a bit like a Barleywine & as it warms, becomes sweet & malty at the end.

3060,"2015-07-15",4.1,"At cellar temperature and into a brandy snifter. It is radiant when held to the lights but is misted by a lot of fine sediment caught in suspension. Like a good Barleywine the head is short lived replaced instead by oily, viscous legs. The body a deep, burnished copper. Thick and rich, melanoidens and savoury fruit mince nose hinting at fresh baked fruit cake dowsed in sherry. There is a hint of vanillin and milk chocolate, earth and oak underneath that gives complexity. A little rough on the palate. Twiggy bark atop earthy, spicy hops in the very back broaden the chewy, meaty malts. Nice, sweet, toffee and burnt caramel front with the generous, savoury minced fruit of nose playing on the mid-palate. Rolling it around it cedes up the alcohol in a hugely peppery effort. Bitter and lasting finish that holds a lot of warmth and ashen, earthy, musty notes. More English than U.S in style - which I love - so hoping the bitterness dulls after a few years of cellaring. The body is good and the carbonation low to medium with an oily finish stripped short only by the alcohol. Well rounded with a lot going on. I love it so a few bottles away for a few years is a must!

3060,"2014-10-20",4.2,"Bells Third Coast Old Ale is an old ale in name only, as it doesnt have any of the barrel character often found in traditional brews of the style. This is more of an English-style barleywine, and its quite good. A complex palette thats also perfectly balanced and highly drinkable. Impressive.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 9/5/14 and cost $4.35 ($0.36 per ounce).

Appearance: Beautiful cherry wood hue, slightly translucent. Pours to a large, dirty white, frothy head which laces and retains very well.

Smell: Surprisingly mild nose with a general sweetness of red fruit, sangria, and a hint of alcohol.

Taste: In the glass, Bells Third Coast Old Ale looks a lot like a cabernet Sauvignon wine, which is interesting because it has a lot in common with that style as far as flavor notes go. Right away theres a sweet taste of dark cherry, strawberry and pomegranate  if all were covered in milk chocolate. On the second half theres a noticeable dry bitterness, slightly sharp, followed by a rich sweetness of toffee and butterscotch. And while all these flavors taste good, I am a little surprised that their intensity is not through the roof (especially in a fresh bottle). 

Drinkability: Big heavy beers in this style that weigh in at 10.2% ABV tend to be difficult to drink, but Bells Third Coast Old Ale is remarkably approachable. The mouthfeel is not sticky or thick, but closer to a medium body with low carbonation. The texture is silky smooth, which makes it easy to gulp down, especially considering theres no alcohol warmth, either. An ideal liquid dessert.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

3060,"2014-09-19",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 7-24-13-

 Poured from bottle into a snifter

 Appearance  Pours a deep mahogany color with some ruby highlights shining through when held up to the light. Upon pouring there is a small tan colored head. The head fades rather fast leaving only a trace of lace on the sides of the glass. While there is little lacing a thickness can be seen when swirling in the glass as the brew clings to the side leaving a fast dissipating foam on the glass once the liquid recedes.

 Smell  The aroma is malty and fruity with a big malty bread smell mixed with lots of darker fruits. The darker fruits are mainly of a plum, prune, raisin and fig aroma bringing a rather sweeter smell to the brew. While the fruit brings a sweetness some hop of an earthy and herbal nature along with a boozy rum smell help balance the aroma creating a warming smell overall.

 Taste  The taste begins with a smoother bready and slightly fruit flavors taste. The fruit is of the darker fruits that were detected in the nose. While the nose was rather heavy overall in the sweeter fruit, the taste was not but instead was heavier on the bready tastes upfront. As the taste advances the breadiness remains the same in intensity, but the fruity flavors dwindle some. As this occurs some spice flavors of nutmeg and clove come to the tongue along with some earthy bitter hop and a moderately strong rum flavor. The rum and hop get stronger more toward the end and when combined with the now lighter fruit and bready flavor create a moderately bitter and rummy taste to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is super thick and creamy with a carbonation level that is on quite low. Both work in concert to create a mouth coating feel bringing all the drier, slightly earthy, malty and boozier flavor to linger on the tongue creating a very warming feel.

 Overall  A barley that is a bit on the drier and more bitter side with a big warming and slow drinking style. This one is nice to sit down with for a long haul.","","Darkmagus82"

3060,"2014-06-02",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2015 Has a sweet, spicy, complex aroma. More hops in the scent than most barleywines/old ales I have had. Caramel and some booze in the aroma. Im getting some citrus as well. Pours a great dark ruby color with a thin white head; moderate lacing on the glass - just beautiful. Taste is caramel/butterscotch at first, malt sweetness second, slight booze third and piney hop bitterness fourth. Palate is slick with more carbonation than I was expecting (a great surprise for me). Aftertaste is intense at first but fades wonderfully, faintly present at the time of your next sip, no matter when that is. Says Old Ale on the bottle, RB classifies it as a barleywine - personally, I think its an Old Ale, either way, its great. Adding to its appeal is that you can buy a 6-pack of this 10% ABV beer. I dont know of any other beers that offer that except Expedition Stout - maybe its a Bells thing. This lets you drink 4 and cellar 2 for later. Go buy this right now. 
Currently drinking a 2 year old bottle.  Much less hops in the aroma, more butterscotch/caramel.  Taste is also less hoppy, still boozy with a good amount of sweetness.  Palate is still slick and full, carbonation is significant.  I cant say the aged bottle is any better, but it is just as good.","Missouri, USA","coachd"

3060,"2013-12-13",4.1,"Dark like rosewood. Feels like syrup in the mouth. What a great malt character this one has. Not very hoppy compared to some of the other barleywines Ive had that go that route. Caramel, licorice, and molasses on the nose. Sweet caramel maltiness from the very beginning. The abv on this beer is not hidden, but isnt completely in your face. The hops that are present lend a very minor bitterness and a VERY small amount of dank taste, but I suspect the rest of the moldiness (in a good way) comes from the other parts.","Cary, North Carolina, USA","Xenon"

3060,"2013-12-05",4.1,"Third review: batch 9958 (25AUG10)

Pours a dr.pepper cola with a loose bubble sheet of light tan foam. Smells from afar of caramel, as I draw in: gobs of sugar, caramel, tea, turbinado, malt, a hint of nougat. Taste is sweet with alcohol, caramel, bits of almond rocha, metal, still sharp alcohol here. Medium on thick body for the style with moderated assertive carb and a semi dry finish. This is a decent beer. If I lived in the distro, Id throw a few in the cellar annually. So far, Ive only had em back two years, I think I will hold my last bottle for the five year mark and see where that lands me.

Review 1: Batch 9958: 08/25/10
Review 2: Followed by Batch 8943: 1/28/09 - reviewed 03MAR11 4/4.5/4.5/4/4.5-4.43
A: Ale pours a nice cherry orange amber. No head formation. Thin sheet of fine bubbles that sticks around. Spotty laces.
A2: Again pours cherry ale. This time forms a single finger, creamy tan head with just a few moments of retention. This dissolves to leave a solid sheet of the same. Initially, full drapes for laces, when stirred, lacing disappears for good.
S: Caramel, toffee, burnt sugar. Great malt body in the nose. Hints of oaky drieness, somewhat woody. Alcohol boozy, but very well enveloped. Not much hops here. Hints of vanilla on the back.
S2: Two years into maturation, this beer develops even more caramel, toffee tones. Beautifully matured malts, burnt sugar, brown sugar and now: hints of molasses.
T: Lovely caramel malt. Alcohol still a little hot at this age (six months). Very drinkable. Sweet, but has nice earthly hop addition and mellow mallow tones. Good.
T2: Uh oh, this is sooo good! Man, the toffee turns to salted caramel. Man, so good. Still backing of bitter hops. Alcohol a little more evident in this one, but sweet and good.
M: Smooth, low carb, medium-heavy body. Silk screen in the mouth, leaves the mouth slick. Nice.
M2: Continues to be smooth, a little more carbonation. Leaves the mouth more or less dry at this point. 
D: I would drink this on a very regular basis if it was available in the area. So nice.
D2: This has convinced me that I need to come up with a good vertical of this beer. I am stoked because this beer is relatively inexpensive and easily available.

3060,"2013-12-03",4.1,"12 oz bottle, Bridge Street Kroger in Dublin, $15.99/6. Pours a darker brown, with creamy one-finger white head that dissipates into nothing; medium lacing. Aroma is indescribably just ""old""--like an old wooden library full of dusty leather-bound books; dirt, tobacco, malt, some dark vinous fruit (maybe raisin). Flavor is similarly ""old""; tobacco, dark malt, some bitterness in the finish offsets the sweet dark malt. Palate is fantastic; dark and full bodied, oily, yet not overly sticky. Not particularly sweet as barley wines go, which is fine. The other 5 bottles are already on the shelf and I may pick up another sixer for a longer-term aging venture.

And its an interesting parallel: while the Hopslam sports an enviable hop profile, this one stands out on account of its spectacular malt bill. The aroma is dark, sumptuous, and sexy, with dried fruits (figs, raisins, prunes) fighting with overripe ones (cherries, plums) for attention, all on a background of wood, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, and toffee. The taste is strong, with a a woody, boozy bitter and sweet, fruity undertones. Bitter malts and piney hops linger in the aftertaste. The alcohol is very much perceivable, but it isnt intrusive. The mouthfeel is absolutely fantastic: viscous, creamy, fulfilling. Dangerously close to perfection, although a tad too filling. God, its such a mess. A filthy, sexy mess.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

Taste includes a warming alcohol presence thats tamed by sweet raisins, plums, dark figs, caramelized & almost burnt sugar.

Listed as ""Bells Old Ale"" on their brewery taplist. I understand that this is a different Old Ale than Third Coast, even though RateBeer has deemed it an alias recently. Tap @ Bells: Deep rustic copper and cloudy, ruby-red; thin eggshell head. Aroma of raisins, figs, and booze-soaked dates. Strong brandy and wine-like alcohol presence in both aroma and flavor. Very potent, sherry and brandy heat in the throat. Sweetness helps to cut the burn a bit; grapes, raisins, plums. Sweet malt in the form of caramel, sticky toffee, and butter. Astringency in the finish with a bitter bite. Heavy, sticky, oily mouth feel with low carbonation. Great beer, just a little too immature and perhaps too hot to love. Even sipping can be a tough exercise. Tasty though, and would be grand if mellowed out a bit.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Aroma is fairly malty with some dark caramel, toffee, and hints of scholars and roast. Some fruitiness with cherries, raisins, fig and plum. A light sherry note is also present. Pours a fairly dark brown with light amber highlights and a small, medium thickness tan head that recedes fairly quickly to the edges. No lacing but moderately big legs. Flavor is big on malt and fruit. Initially it's caramel and toffee but that turns into chocolate and roast but then becomes toasted bread. The fruit is more prevalent upfront with cherries and plums while the finish has more raisin and prune. Moderately strong bitterness in finish but no hop flavor. Light alcohol spice in the finish works with the toasted bread and raisins. Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium low carbonation. Low astringency and moderate alcohol warmth. A slight stickiness in the finish. Overall a fairly nice old ale with some nice malt character and complimentary fruit notes. I like the way the beers character changes so much throughout a single sip. This one is showing oxidation as I found it in a box that's been sitting in my cellar for at least two years, but the oxidation is light and sherry-like. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3060,"2013-04-18",4.7,"I found this guy at some random liquor store an hour away from my house when i was bored one day looking to buy some beer. It was aged 6 months in the bottle.

There is very little head that completely went away quickly. This beer has my absolute favor aroma Ive smelled in any beer. Its smell is evenly split up between caramel, chocolate, fruityness, and brown sugar. The taste is also phenomenal and extremely complex. Its very similar to the aroma but it has a nice alcoholic warmth to it. It also has a little dark chocolate and burnt caramelly which makes for one of my favorite beers.

3060,"2013-04-07",4.0,"Tried a 2011 and a 2012 side by side.  The newer version had much more of a bite, old version had definitely mellowed out and has more of a smoothness.  Older version is sweeter and I prefer the more aged version.  Noticeable color difference between the two as well.

3060,"2013-04-05",3.7,"Bottle from trade with umich03jm. Interested in this since its rated high in the style, this bottle looks to be about a year old. Pours medium brown with a low, weak head. Aroma is malt with big carmel notes, and a hint of alcohol. Flavor is pretty well balanced between malt and hop bitterness, sort of along Bigfoot type barley wine. Significant alcohol burn, but doesnt detract. Not very complex, but more here than just sweet malt and bitterness. Flavor is fairly intense, almost overdone for my tastes. Looks like this brew would hold to to aging very well. Good sipper, but probably would benefit from my cellar time, and more complexity.

Taste follows aroma with the caramel and roasted malt.  Dark fruits and grassy, lingering bitterness from hops that was a surprise.  Alcohol is apparent in flavor and has a slight warming effect.  Mouthfeel is medium/full with moderate carbonation and leans toward being dry with a bit of residual sweetness.  A good barleywine that was more bitter than I like and more than expected.

Pours a nice ruby red with a thin light khaki head. There is a little Bit of sediment floating around with a small amount of visible carbonation.
Aroma has lots of dark fruit, cherry, plumb, sweet roasted malt, caramel, finished with a bit of booze. 
First sip you get a lot of sweetness on the front of the tongue and the bitterness follows at the back. The taste really stays true to the nose. Lots of dark fruit, sweet malt, caramelized sugar, and a nice hop finish accompanied by booze.

Third Coast Old Ale has a caramel copper color with a thick creamy head. Leaves some lacing down the side of the glass.

Dark fruits, cherries, caramel, and molasses flow into my nose. A very strong, sweet smelling ale, although I would expect this from a barley wine.

Strong raisin and fig flavor throughout. Firm molasses malt taste carries most of the sip. A light bitterness lingers in the mouth, but not much of a hop presence. My only criticism of this one would be how sweet it is.

Even more noticeable than the taste is how creamy of a feel this has. Very smooth, to which the self-replenishing head will testify.

Of course this is a sipper. The sweetness lends it to be a beer best served with dessert or after dinner. A nice, strong flavor masks the ABV, but I will definitely still not be putting too many of these down in one sitting.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3060,"2011-10-20",4.4,"G. Gordon Liddy once wrote, ""Drink this beer, it shall give you imeasurable strength."" I dont know if thats true. Infact I know its not. It might be. 

Im not the least bit curious what beer he was citing- maybe this one. Probably. One can hope. I will say with absolution this is a crown of the style. 
Brilliant bright nose; as she sits today=young as heck- its malt forward and full of nutmeg-y malt, yet still swirled and cloaked with alcohol warmths, even in its adolesence. Superising how spicy (cinnamon and the likes) it is- would be shocked if these dont take a back seat in the future. Hops are a snapshot in history- great noble oily tartness that balances the strong viscous malt nicely, and then finishes the flavor off for this young old ale, but will bow out as it cellars. Only reason this beer recieved a 17/20 on overall is because I know its going to continue to evolve into greatness.

I remember growing up we had real molasses on the table- that my family made, and sometimes it was really dark and sometimes a little lighter, but always sugary.

A - Dark tawny orange color with a healthy sized, creamy, foamy, fairly thick and dense, white head. Plenty of sediment. Great retention leaving a nice layer of lace.

S - Strong caramel smell along with rum soaked golden fruit and orange aroma. Some toffee and other citrus (grapefruit). Faint alcohol presence.

T - Like the nose, there is a large caramel presence with citrus flavor, some rum soaked golden fruit, and hints of alcohol. Some toffee. Hops are there, but not strong, slight herbal and floral flavor. A bit of spice and some spice.

Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a over-sized wine glass.

The color is dark and very cloudy maroon with some reddish highlights and a small wisp of head that cleared out pretty fast and left a small bit of lacing.

The smell is a bit an orange flavor at first. To my surprise there is a light, airy fruit flavor that is a bit like oranges or orange peel in the nose. Some juicy malts are in behind, holding up the set work before leaving a trail of sweetness in your nose for a minuet of two.

The taste is malty at first with a airy malt flavor that seems to pop a bit. There is a nice juicy flavor that continues from the nose, the orange seems to be gone but there is a slight tomato flavor that is mixed with some pears and a bit of a malty finish.

The feel of this beer is pretty big. It has some drinkable, juicy feel to it but also has some complex flavors that add up to a beer with legs. It goes down well but seems to register itself as a beer with a punch.","Cumberland, Rhode Island, USA","Duhast500"

3060,"2010-09-10",4.8,"This whole Micro-brewing has really gotten out of hand here in the states. But, that makes me a hypocrite because I was the first one to complain about not having options. Now Ive too many. Seriously. Its good though to know I can fall back onto some of my favourites before the micro-boom. Bells is one. I havent had all of their brew and may never do so, but damn do I love when I get to try a new one. It really makes me wonder if these other micro-brews sprouting up over night are really that good. Consistency and quality should become key. Its where America went wrong. We cant compete with quantity, and why should we? This brew reads like an American classic. A F. Scott Fitzgerald just makes age more easy, and so age makes this brew much better. But dont be fooled. This was good from the start, much like that Fitzgerald classic. The label does a good job of minimally reaching the point. Lots of sediment in this one so the pour was careful, into the recommend Snifter. Pours a dark brown-burgandy, much like a dark belgian ale. Nice head, good amount of low in fizz to keep it fresh. Nose is lots of vinted malts, oak like vanilla, worn leather. Landscapes of herbal qualities comes to mind. The great and once vast forest of colonial North America, cedar, eucalyptus, oak, maple. Taste is pure class and quality. Well sipped. Oak, worn leather, smooth vanilla ends with herbal and earth tones of fresh dug roots. Buffalo grass,  dark fruits such as plums and a slight apricot. Some slight tanin offers a nice bitterness to round out a slightly sweet, piece of perfection. Most other brewers would ruin this by leaning heavily on brown sugar, a Wal-mart like imitation. But not this brew, and certainly Bells would never sink to such levels. Massive <3s on this one. Next week Ill buy a 6er and see how far 10.2 % can age.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","BeerBlockaid"

3060,"2010-08-28",4.1,"Serving: 12 oz. bottle from Total Wine Sterling. 
Aroma: The nose is big and malty with notes of boozy fruit, raisins, dates, and figs. 
Appearance: It pours a deep amber color but it couldnt even form a head.  Just a small pool of foam sitting in the middle. 
Taste: Sweet but not very boozy considering the high alcohol content.  Lots of dried fruit, ripe plums, dates, raisins, and a surprisingly hoppy content given its age (from 2009).  The bitterness provides nice contrast to the malt sweetness. 
Palate: Medium to rich body with prickly carbonation and a sweet, then bitter finish.  You realize the alcohol content as it warms its way down your throat.

Black Molasses, birch smoke and raw alcohol aromas from this deep burgundy ale, pours with a strong head that quickly recedes to a 1/8"" light tan cap.

Pours dark brown with ruby edges and a one-finger nearly white head which dissapears to just an island of foam.  Lacing is pretty scarce as well.  Odd since bubbles hang all over the place within. Nose is lots of malt, raisins, banana, and rum.  Taste starts very sweet - brown sugar, raisins, grapes, caramel, then some breadiness with some bitterness, dryness, and warming in the finish.  Mouthfeel is heavy with lots of carbonation. This is a sipper but a nicely complex (interesting) brew that I have had before and will seek out again.","Havertown, Pennsylvania, USA","regspeir"

The aroma is extremely complex with red wine, brandy, figs, dried prunes, raisins, and rich sugars.  No hop aroma.  Its one of those you can keep your nose in forever.  Taste is super heavy with esters and caramelized sugars.  Just enough bitterness to keep the sweetness from being cloying.  Full body with just enough carbonation to keep it lively.

Pours a deep reddish amber color with a small, creamy beige head.  The aroma is a nice blend of dark fruits, creamy caramel, citrusy hops and some alcohol.  The flavor has ample dark fruitiness, more creamy caramel, a still noticeable amount of citrus and earthy hops that bring a solid bitterness well into the finish, and signs of the 10.2%. The alcohol is more warming than anything.   With warming, I also get more brown sugar flavors working their way in.  Medium-full bodied.

The mouthfeel is thin to medium, silky and syrupy some what.  The flavor is somewhat subdued - and not knowing this was a barley wine, I would have never guessed the 10.2% alcohol content. Decent brew.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
3060,"2010-04-26",3.5,"12 oz bottle poured into my snifter.

A- Body is a beautiful translucent medium mahogany hue that pours with a minuscule off-white head that dissipates so fast that I cant recall the exact color. Small white particles can be seen floating throughout as well as some yeast.

S- Molasses and caramel malt come through first in this brew with a hint of phenols. Im picking up something else but I cant tell quite what it is as I am not too familiar with this style of beer.

T- The flavor upfront is mild and I notice a hint of barley as well as caramel malt initially. A hint of molasses and sweetness is there as well. A sharp phenolic bitterness comes through at the end then the sweetness quickly soothes this and a nice balance of heat and sweetness come through much like a bourbon.

P- Medium to high carbonation. Body has a moderate phenolic acidity to it that is the highlight but not cloying.

O- This is a complex and interesting brew that I cant quite get my palate around. Im pretty inexperienced with the Strong Ales (Barleywines, Old Ales, other Strong Ales) and I tend to shy away from them- because they arent really my thing. The character to this one is phenolic for sure as it is a relatively fresh bottle, but it also has a distinctive sweetness to it and good complexity. I would like to try it once it has some age behind it. Its fun to venture to a style I am less familiar with none the less.

The aroma is multi dimensional featuring elements of maple, oak, caramel, candy, and raisons. The taste contains much of the same. Caramel malts lead the way mixed with maple syrup, raisons and a touch of nut. Taste like it was wood aged as it has hints of bourbon. There is a significant alcohol presence in every sip making this a very warming beer. I imagine sitting by a fire on a cold winter night.","Pennsylvania, USA","sarahmarie"

A lot of raisin and apricot notes in the flavors, which were accentuated by a hint of sourness in the finish.  A very satisfying heft to this beer as it traveled down the tongue.  Not a coating nature, but not slippery either.  Just a textured caress all the way through, somewhat similar to an orange juice with pulp in this matter.

Loads and loads of plum and caramel malt, coffee and a bit of chocolate.  Flavors follow the nose mostly, big creamy malt and caramel.  Huge booze on this, with a sort of packing peanut taste on the finish initially, moving towards coffee grounds as it warms.  The booze is so glaring its really hard to drink.

On the pour, a light layer of cream head, a medium thick body, and dark cola brown in color. As far as the taste goes, this is a great feeling beer, especially on a cold winter night. Sweet, full bodied, creamy, and yet has the right amount of pop. The aroma and flavor notes also play off each other very well, each with a similar profile.

Man, I love Bells Brewery, and Im glad to finally get the chance to try this one. Super thanks go out to VandenBossche for hooking me up with this.

Pours a hazy, medium/dark brown color. A lightbulb will get the edges to show a golden glow, but little else. One-finger head od truly tan colored foam. Retention is okay. Lacing is spotty, but fairly decent.

Nice level of maltiness comes through, surrounded by a big presence of breadiness. Raisins and dark fruit jamminess. Slight earthiness mingles with a nice hint of maraschino cherries (!). Loads of sugarey sweet caramel notes. Definite brown sugar notes.
Smells like a decadent dessert brew.

Butterey french toast, covered in cherry syrup. 
Big yeasty bread notes, nice sweet caramel presence, slight hints of warming spices and a top-off of sweet cherry flavor. 
A different taste than Im used to expecting from an Olde Ale, but I certainly like it.

Smooth and creamy, which is nice, but I expected it to be a bit more lush. Especially after the nose. (Yum!) So, it could have done better, here.

The ABV is undetectable, by me, so Id say, drink em if it suits ya. It suits me quite nicely, thankee sai. 
I just wish I had regular access to Bells and didnt have to rely on trades, or out-of-town trips, to aquire them.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","coldmeat23"

Aroma is of soft, sweet butterscotch, nuts, vanilla, some spices, perhaps cinnamon or cardamom, raisin and dried apricot. These notes return in the flavour, along with fresh tasting bready malts and brown sugar with a solid earthy and slightly citric semi dry hop finish that makes it surprisingly drinkable. A noticable alcohol sting as well. This bitterness in the finish is actually a bit harsh, would have liked it toned down just a little bit. Guess that will improve with age, but for now, I only have this one bottle. Full bodied, carbonation is smooth, loads of tiny tiny bubbles.

3060,"2009-09-17",3.6,"12 oz bottle from a long while back, single bottle frm somewhere. Pours a nice copper hue, darker, decent haze, a nice red body underneath almost, with a moderate tannish head, stays at a decent layer with decent lacing. Aromas are a rich caramel and toffee malt base, bringing floral and grapefruit hops underneath, a rich sweetness with a touch of toast, vanilla, and a faint nuttiness. Good fruitiness, almost candied fruit is the theme. Initial is a richer sweet body, still only moderate bodied, with a decent dosing of hoppy bitterness behind. Toffee, caramel, a touch of vanilla, with some candied fruits, or sweeter ones at that, with a decent booziness, dusting of cinnamon. The hoppy elements are pretty good and help balance this malty brew, in fact the hops are really the most prominent part of the finish with some decent trailing malty sweetness.

3060,"2009-09-16",3.6,"12oz bottle, batch 8211, poured into a tulip.

Pours a murky caramel brown with hints of orange through the edges with a big creamy off-white head that shows fairly good retention and leaves very little lacing.

The aroma is dominated by caramel malts, toffee and dark fruits.  There are lots of sugar coated raisins in the nose and there is a bit of citrus hops left in the nose up front, but theyre not nearly as noticeable as they likely were fresh.

The taste is slightly more bitter with a sharp hop bitterness up front which gives way to the toasted caramel malts, but its definitely less sweet than the aroma would suggest.  As it warms, the toffee and dark fruits start to show, but the finish is boozy and bitter with less lingering sweetness than I was expecting.

The mouthfeel is slick with soft carbonation and a sugary dessert-like body overall.  Definitely coats the palate completely.

This is a solid brew from Bells, a drinkable barleywine thats not overly complex but is certainly tasty.  Its not one of my favorites from Bells, but thats a pretty high hurdle (see Oracle).","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

3060,"2009-08-09",4.1,"My chalice glows with the dark rusty haze of old ale delights. She is burnished mahogany and old wood given a new breath of life. A soft khaki head laps at the edges of my glass, splashing back to the center in confused globules of fragile foam. Lace carefully decorates while I cup my glass, waiting a few minutes for my body warmth to coax her closer to proper quaffing temperature. As I wait, her nose grows ever impatient; deciding to take action in her own hands, an irresistible aura of sweet boozy delights strut their stuff under my nose. Seduction is her wily ploy, and I am a willing victim. Nose-deep into my glass, wanting to be as close as possible to heaven, my nose drips a precious drop or two of Old Ale when I emerge for air. Sweet and boozy with spiced rum, brown sugar, maple, dry wood, burnt sugars, earthy licorice root, red apples, pears, dried cherries, dried prunes, and a warm wisp of chili powder and dried chili peppers. Did you get all that? Take notes. I know I did, and I lay with her nose for a good many minutes. Beautiful. As I wet eager lips, the skies open, light shines down, and angels sing. Another beautiful beer moment has descended even as my soul ascends. Rich, sweet, dry, and mouth-coating all at the same time. Whether an Old Ale or Barleywine, it is easy to understand why these robustly complex beers were prized during the 19th century; and even more mind-boggling why they almost disappeared from the pages of brewing all together. But I digress. She immediately leaves my mouth awash with dry wood, dry spices, and pervading warmth that soothes. Her alcohol hits the back of my throat while my lips smack with brown sugars and warm maple syrup. In the middle, red apples and yellow pears picked fresh from the orchard explode with flavor as I bite into their juicy bounty. A wisp of tart prune juice flitters on and off again as rum, spice, wood, plums, apples, pears, and warmth make sweet love to my palate. Exquisite. Delicious. An instant classic. I cant wait to see how she matures over time.


I almost want to set aside more than one bottle of this beer to age, but I only have so much space in the old apartment to utilize at the moment. The idea is tempting though In the meantime, the Third Coast Old Ale from Bells Brewing is a seasonal release, so make sure to grab a 6pack or two before the 2009 batch is retired and one has to wait until spring of 2010 for more.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

3060,"2009-07-14",3.6,"Bottle, thanks to tytoanderso. Aroma big and malty with tons of toffee and brown sugar, orange fruits cutting through just a bit, not sure if its from hops or not. Flavor follows just as expected. Wasnt bad at all, enjoyable even, but also for me exactly the same as many another such beast.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
3060,"2009-07-13",4.1,"Bottle pours dark brown with a thin beige head. Lots of malty goodness in the nose. Flavor is lots of malt, dark ripe fruit, and a little booze.","Kearney, Missouri, USA","topherh"
3060,"2009-07-13",4.1,"bottle, pours brown with a medium off white head.  Aroma is light with brown sugar, some vanilla and yeast.  Flavors start mildly sweet with some biscuit malt and a tart apricot feel that yeilds to a hop and spiced peppercorn finish.  Lingers, but is dry at the same time.  A nice barley wine that grows in character as it warms with some alcohol in the finish as well.  Carbonation is moderate with a medium to heavy mouthfeel.  I could sip this for a while.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","fata2683"
3060,"2009-07-13",4.0,"12 oz bottle at brickskeller in DC. Pours a nice dark almost opaque brown color. Aroma is sweet and malty with some spice. Taste is pretty spicy and sweet, very little bitterness, and the high alcohol content is very evident. Palate is very full and really fills the mouth with flavor. Very full body- not really meant to be consumed in large quantities. Definitely suited for a cold winter night but enjoyable any time of the year.","Bridgewater, NJ, New Jersey, USA","rugbydude05"
3060,"2009-07-12",3.7,"Bottle.  Pours a super cloudy brown with a small ring of white head.  Aroma of super sweet malt, raisin, apple skins.  Typical barleywine aroma.  Flavor is quite malty with light fruits and raisins.  Certainly very sweet but not bad actually (considering that barleywines are not my favorite style).  Heavy though.

Rustic, bountiful frothy head with deep, dark mahogany body - looks like very nice stuff.

A little skunky aroma, sort of like raw dough or sourdough - interesting

Deep hoppiness and heavy caramel malt with alcohol presence - balance is not an issue

Bitter mouthfeel but it coats nicely

Good stuff - of course its rather heavy","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"
3060,"2009-07-07",4.1,"12 oz bottle in a snifter. Pours a cloudy dark tea color, lots of sediment, with a decent off-white head which dissipates.  Aroma is burnt candied sugar, toffee, brown sugar, lots of sweet malts.  Flavor is sweet malt, caramel, brown sugar, maple, and nice hopped bitter finish.  Nice alcohol warmth which is true to the style.  This could age very well.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","mcmd"
3060,"2009-07-07",3.9,"Amazingly, if I have had this one, I dont remember.  A very impressive looking beer, a dark, deep amber color with a nice fruity sweet aroma.  This beer is sweet, malty and full of fruit, but has a nice hop presence and a nice warm ending.  This is a great beer, one that could only improve with time.  I would like to try this one on draft or maybe try it in a vertical tasting.","Kettering, Ohio, USA","Maddog"
3060,"2009-07-02",3.5,"12 oz bottle from Greenwood in Bowling Green. Off-white moderate head fades quickly and leaves some lacing on sides of glass. Rusty brown body, slightly hazy and thick.

The alcohol is pretty forward on this one.","Austin, Texas, USA","ManvsCity"
3060,"2009-06-29",3.6,"I have been cellaring this since 2003: Pours a murky brick red with almost no head. Brown sugar, plums, maple syrup, damp basement and alcohol on the nose.

This ages better than most of the other barleywines I have cellared, but I prefer it fresh.","Freeport, Illinois, USA","slitcher"

First third (top third of botte) amber, transparent with a little settlement.  Second third: more brown but significant move to translucent bordering on opaque.  Bottom third: Opaque, brown.  Taste:  Combined all three pours.  Typical barleywine, although I would say the heat of the alcohol wasnt as well hidden as I would like.  Palate: again, typical barleywine style - it was fine, but nothing outstanding.  Overall: solid, safe Barley Wine style ale, but not truly exceptional.",", Indiana, USA","ajbitt"

I like my barley wines to be prominent and strong and nothing in particular stood out on this one.","USA","flyingshoes"
3060,"2009-06-14",3.3,"Tasting at Bells Fest in OH.  Poured a very interesting cloudy plum color with no head, reminded me of a bloody mary actually.

3060,"2009-06-12",2.8,"Murky amber-brown, medium beige head, only temporary lace. Aroma of caramel, with a bit of smoke and toffee.  Flavor of caramel, powerfully resinous, woody, pine resin, tea, a bit of orange juice. Nothing is off here, and its certainly not bland, but it comes together as far less than the sum of its parts, and I dont like it. Full bodied, drinks smoothly.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","noncaloric"
3060,"2009-06-10",3.6,"Moderately strong aroma of caramel, figs, walnuts, blackberries, with a buttery edge. Cloudy brown, full of floaties. Medium yellow head. Resinously bitter and syrupy sweet.

I found it overbearing, but  enjoyable when sipping. Not for chugging!","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
3060,"2009-06-08",4.3,"A dark and foreboding concoction from Bells, great for a winter day or even, as it was for me, a weekend afternoon in June.  This is a peculiar one, it seemed to me that the beer was in a bad mood.  Dark, surly, and angry all come to mind.  Beer noir might be a better name for this one, and not as a reference to the color.  Hurts so good.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","Holtguy"
3060,"2009-05-24",4.4,"12 oz bottle courtesy of Adrian. Pours a dark cloudy amber colour with a reddish tint. Had a frothy off-white head which quickly dissipated.

3060,"2009-05-05",4.0,"Pours deep mahogany with thick tan head.  Aroma is bursting with dark fruit- cherries, plum, figs, and some vinous notes, along with cola, biscuit, brown sugar, and oak.  Very slight citrus notes come through after some warming.  Flavor begins with sweet cherry and grape and finishes with bready malts, cola, chocolate, caramel, and some malty bitterness.  Really well balanced.  Palate is full and rich without being sticky.  Great example of a traditional ale.","Quincy, Massachusetts, USA","lordeche"
3060,"2009-05-04",3.8,"Deep reddish-brown pour with a bit of haziness and a foamy head.  Malt, ripe fruit, and a touch of hop aroma.  Flavor is about the same.  Good, but I wish there was more hoppiness.","Beautiful Sunny Mesa, Arizona, USA","SuperDave"
3060,"2009-05-04",3.5,"Batch 8211 which was packaged on 11/9/07 so this is about four months old. The color is a dark red and the smell is strong fruits like grapes and then fumes from the alcohol. The flavor is definitely more malty than hoppy and the alcohol is slightly present to the tongue. Overall, decent barleywine.

The nose is, however, dominated by a dark fruit character and heavily roasted malts, which have an almost nutty quality. There is a smoky character to the beer too. Wonderful to sniff.

3060,"2009-03-03",3.7,"Picked up this beer at Bruisin Ales in North Carolina. Glad they had Bells brewery beer there. Wow, this beer has a huge MALT aroma. Very nice. Almost chocolate like. Just a nice malt aroma that is pouring out of this beer. Not much of a head, but a thin head around the edge of the beer. Deep dark translucent brown with some crap floating around that eventually settles to the bottom of your glass. Wow, very creamy beer that has a heavy malt taste. The malt/chocolate malt aroma matches the flavor almost perfectly. Slight bitter hop at the end, not very bitter though. A nice barley wine, that if aged for a few years would be most amazing. Alcohol is WELL hidden. Overall, just a nice malty barley wine with great flavors. Sweet malts and a damn good barley wine with a nice subtle bitter finish.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

Flavor is sweet and malty up front, but hops slowly arise on the way back along with alcohol and bitterness lingers and is most apparent in the after taste. Alcohol peaks just as it goes down, but doesnt linger afterward - overall it is well balanced and even hidden for a beer of this strength. Full bodied and creamy-smooth.

3060,"2009-01-23",3.2,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2010 Re-Rate on 1/22/2010: 12oz bottle. Batch 8723 bottled on Sept 5, 2008. Pours a deep, murky, amber-red colored body with a finger-width, creamy, slowly dissipating, tannish brown head that leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is like I remembered, but Im going to bump it point. Sweet and malty with some plum and strawberry caramels, nutty toffees, raisin bread, and a light earthy cocoa. Not a whole lot of hoppiness to this malty aroma. Flavor is better than I remember, but still a little too sweet. The booze has settled down a lot since my last rating. Big and rich, very sweet malts up front with a strawberry fruitiness. More sweet toffees with a lighter nut than the aroma, plenty of raisin bread and other sweet fruits, caramels, honey, and a syrupy sweetness. Finishes with a light woody and earthy citrus that dries with just a touch of booze and a chewy maltiness that lingers for a moderate duration. Full body. Overall, a year later the booze has clearly settled, but it remains too sweet and chewy for my liking. The aroma has diminished somewhat and the malts dominate the hops. I dont know...maybe I wasnt meant to love Bells barley wine. (7,4,6,3,12=3.2).
Original Rating on 1/23/2009. 12oz bottle. Pours a murky, amber-red body with some particulate floating around. Very thin, beige head that dissipates immediately and remains delicately laced. The aroma is mainly sweet and malty. Lots of strawberry candy sugar malts with a bunch of toffee and a light boozy and doughy yeast backing. Flavor is initially very rich and sweetly malted before finishing boozy and moderately citrus hopped. Palate is pretty full and chewy with a dry and very woody finish. Overall, this is pretty boozy right now. The big maltiness is balanced decently well right now with the bitterness, but the big booze flavor is really bothering me. Im going to age the rest of this six pack and hope that this matures in time. I look forward to re-rating this in the future, but until then, this is off.

Flavors are exquisite butterscotch, toffee, apple cider, overall a fairly sweet experience.  The hops are undeniable in this one, bringing some bitter citrus fruit to the profile.  Overall, very well balanced sweetness to bitterness.  Decent carbonation makes this lively and very interesting.  One criticism is that it could be a bit more complex.  I am going to put a few of these away.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","dmtroyer"

3060,"2008-09-25",3.9,"Batch 7236 ~ 2006 Vintage
9/25/2008:  Third Coast Old Ale has a deep ruby amber color with a thin beige crown.  The nose is greeted by a hearty citrusy hop aroma accompanied by rich caramel, hints of vanilla, and some sweet alcohol.  The flavor is very strong and contains a smooth, caramel maltiness, aged alcohol, and a moderate citrus and herbal hoppiness.  There is some residual sweetness as well along with notes of prune, dried apricot, and and vanilla.  The bitterness lingers on the back of the tongue after each sip.  This beer is still quite smooth and easy to drink despite its high alcohol.  It is medium-bodied and mildly carbonated.  Overall this was a very good barleywine and is well-balanced.  However, I would have preferred a bit more sweetness.  Im sure this beer gets even better with another 1 or 2 years on it...

No Batch # ~ 2002 or Older Vintage (1-piece label and plain gold cap)
9/25/2008:  Third Coast Old Ale has a sweet aroma made up of caramel, dates, raisin, complex fruity malt (e.g. Marris Otter) and a hint of vanilla.  This beer really smells great.  It also looks really nice too.  It has a clear, deep honey color with ruby highlights and tight, shimmering carbonation.  There is a thin frothy beige veil floating on the surface.  The flavor is sweet and still has a decent level of sweet, aged citrus/apricot hop flavor and bitterness.  The slightly roasty caramel maltiness is also accompanied by a really smooth whiskey/brandy alcohol tone, prune and other aged fruits.  Again, this beer is very smooth and very easy to drink for its high alcohol content.  It is medium-bodied and has a mildly syrupy mouthfeel and a sticky quality on the lips.  The additional age on this particular bodied has helped the sweetness come through the normally high bitterness level.  It has developed a wonderful aroma and the flavor is quite good and balanced, but some complexity may be starting to fade away at this point...

Old ales are their own style, not necessarily barley wines, just barley wine strengths.  I’ve only had the Three Floyd’s Behemoth barley wine, and that one was a lot more balanced and sweeter than this one.  Pours as dark as a porter, no head, really, or just a short one.

3060,"2008-07-27",3.7,"Thanks to alexsdad06 for this!  Pours dark brown with rusty highlights and a long lasting, fairly large off-white head. Aroma is of tobacco, leaves, grapefruit, dirt, wood, and maybe just a bit of mint or lime.  Tastes surprisingly hoppy, which I didn’t expect!  Bitter grapefruit hop flavor, but it’s an either grapfruit, along with caramel, dirt, burnt toast, tobacco, slight vanilla.  Malt flavors seem slightly light.  Finishes with an ""Arrogant Bastard"" style aftertaste of grapefruit and dark malt roast flavors.  Lingering tobacco flavor in the aftertaste along with grapefruit and a sort of unpleasant salty cloying sensation.  Very creamy bodied but the flavors seemed so soft to the point where it made the beer seem thinner than it actually is.  I’m not sure how that works.

Bitter, woody, citrus hoppy, not a lot of alcohol (just warming on finish), hints of red fruit (cherries).  Thinner on the palate than abv. and style would suggest, but still smooth and pleasant.

In long: Toffee and caramel.  Some dried fruits, some raisins, some cranberries, some cherries dipped in chocolate.  Some whiskey hints.  Finish has some dryness but overall the fruity Hops is not assertive enough.  Although commercial description says this is one to age I suspect this beer is at best when fresh, with some hops presence.   I dont care for this beer.  Big distribution, very cheap, liked by everyone, very reliable are you sure this is not made in Japan?","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

3060,"2008-06-06",3.9,"Thanks to Secret Santa & Photekut, I have two bottles to enjoy!  Pours a murky deep reddish brown with a moderate tan head that quickly disappeared and left very little lace.  Very pleasant aroma of sweet malt, brown sugar and dates.  The flavor is very similar, but not as sweet as the aroma, with some alcohol and hops bitterness at the finish.  The bitterness lingers at the roof of my mouth well after the swallow.

Pours a hazy funky brown that seems to have the slightest hint of pinkish red highlights and an average to slightly small creamy beige head. Aroma has lots of malts, caramel, toffee, alcohol, maple syrup blending nicely. The body on this one doesnt hide the 10.2% to well but it still goes down rather easy. Flavor of grain, caramel, some rotting fruit, and finishes up with some shery type flavors. Although this is listed as a BW and a very nice beer it is slightly dry to style but still a great drink.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

3060,"2008-05-02",3.3,"Pours muddy, dark amber, with a tan, somewhat dense head of medium duration. A few streaks of lacework remained as well as a film of bubbles on the surface. Quite a bit of particulates floating about and looking very murky. 
Aromatics are malt-laden, with caramel undertones and tinged brown sugar. A faint citrus profile along with raisin pulp adds some complexity. 
The mouthfeel is sticky, slick, and somewhat grainy. 
Pallet is pretty staightfoward, with carmelized malt and sugars. Barely a hint of any vineousity leans in the ""old ale"" direction, with the profile being more along the lines of an american strong ale. 
Bitterness is slightly heavy-handed, and helps combat the residuals nicely. 
Finishes with a husky coarseness, scortched sugars, and a lingering warmth.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"
3060,"2008-05-02",3.1,"Pours dark amber color with some floaties in there.  Hardly any head.  Sweet up front, molasses with maybe some brandy in there, with a bit of a bitter finish.  Decent but I dont know if Id get it again.","Colorado, USA","That1Guy"

Tons of caramel and molasses in the nose. Rich. Brown sugar and floral hop notes, too. Big caramel up front on the tongue. Candy corn notes intrigues me. Sweet overall. Overall, not that crazy; more focus on yumminess with less attention paid towards complexity. So velvety smooth and balanced, the epitome of a rich, sipping barley wine. It probably wont be the best barley wine you drink, but itll be one of the easiest to enjoy.","Tampa, Florida, USA","gunhaver"
3060,"2008-04-26",4.1,"Old Ale on a monday night? Why the hell not.

A- Pours a nice reddish orange color, fairly clear with a very small head that goes away as quickly as it came.

S- Ahhh heres the old ale smell I love. I still feel tricked by adam. Oh well. This one is big and caramely with small alcohol notes.

T- Starts off deep caramel as in the nose and moves to a huge alcohol flavor that is so prevalent its hard to detect much else under it. Definitely a small hop bite at the end. Even though this one is a little hot I still like it.

M- Thick, low on the carbonation, excellent for the style.

Aroma and flavor are sweet and doughy.  Brown sugar, toffee, and caramel are pronounced.  This beers most redeeming quality is, without doubt, its invisible alcohol content.

3060,"2008-04-14",4.2,"I had no idea what to expect from this one.  The bottle doesnt really indicate this is a barley wine, which I have liked in the past, but have had very little experience with.  Pours a murky reddish brown, with some floaty bits in it.  Not the best look, but I went with it.  Aroma of a cinnamon roll, but without the cinnamon (if that makes sense?).  Flavor was of concentrated malts, with a smoky bitter finish.  I can see how this would age very well.  A lot of yeast sediment in the bottom (more than usual with Bells- which tends to have more than usual that most).  This amount of yeast keeps a yeasty funk in this one that works nicely with the malt and the hops.  Outstanding flavor profile that somehow manages to be malty, yeasty, and hoppy all at once.  I imagine that this one would be difficult to balance.  I would also love to try the barrel aged version of this one.  Another winner from Bells.","Maryville, Tennessee, USA","dolemite77"

3060,"2008-03-29",3.6,"Winter 05-06 bottle tasted March 08.

I brought this bottle back from an Ann Arbor trip a couple of years ago, back before the TSA ban on carry-on beer. It pours an elegant dark caramel with plentiful lacing but not much by way of head. Nose of toffee, oxidized hops, maybe a touch of cinnamon. Rich toffee flavors, moving into the burnt-creme-brulee zone, rich sweet cream with a roasted edge, still an ample bit of hops coming in on the close to drive a fairly bitter finish even at 30+ months of age. Carbonation is very limited; the beer is close to flat but theres enough body to the liquid that its not an enormous problem. 

While its nice, Im just not seeing this as a 95th percentile barleywine. Its not quite doing it for me; there could be more sweetness here, the flavors are coming through a bit chemical. I guess Id better try it fresh and at say 5+ years of age as well; its good enough to merit that bit of exploration.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
3060,"2008-03-29",3.7,"12 oz bottle:  Pours a clear copper amber color with a thick tan head that lingers.  Aroma has got a buttery malt characteristic,  some sharp hop notes as well, and light on the dark fruit.  Taste is got a really nice up front caramel malt, toffee, lightly rounding into a buttery and hoppy texture.  Alcohol is very well hidden for how young this Barley Wine is.  Palate is mildly hoppy with some of the alcohol slipping through.  Overall, I think that this is a decent Barley Wine.  Nice and smooth, but kind of bold at the same time.  Interesting to say the least.  Maybe this one will need some time to mature.","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","demitriustown"

I found it to be pretty dry from beginning to end.  Palate is medium full, with moderate carbonation and a pretty clean, smooth feel.

3060,"2008-02-25",4.3,"I have poured this into a tulip. Where the batch number should be listed, there is only a blank space. Not like it matters anyway, since every time I enter a batch number on the Bells website, it gives me the wrong beer. 

There is a slight head which quickly dissipates to a light swirl. The body is a deep amber color. Pour this carefully, as I was unable to keep some of the chunky yeast out of my glass. The nose is vinous, with the hops and the alcohol making their presence known. I detect some cherries, too. 

The taste is of cherries and raisins, with a nice citric hop character. Caramel malt appears, and I taste every bit of that 9%ABV. I dont ever mind tasting the alcohol. After all, that is a small part of why we drink beer. The mouthfeel is is like thick silk. The low carbonation is in keeping with the style. This is one of my favorite beers, as it is readily available to me pretty much year round. The drinkability rocks. This batch tastes quite fresh to me, but I cannot be certain, because of the problems I listed in the first paragraph. Assuming that this is a fresh sample, it is great now. I will, however, age the four samples remaining from this six-pack until the winter.

Looks great - thick brown with nice yellow-cream colored head.  Smells great as well - caramel and malt and some roasted toffee in there too.  Taste is interesting - it is toothache sweet.  It almost reminds me of dissolved pure sugar cane. Thick and dense texture and finish.  Bourbon wasnt very present in my opinion (or at least not where I wanted it to be).  Overall, pretty darn good and drinkable.","Austin, Texas, USA","pintsize"

Pours a rich dark caramel color with a yellowish beige head.  Taste is rich dark caramel and almost orange creamy citrus as well.  More than ample finishing hops to balance and a lingering very mild sweetness and alcohol flavor at the end.

3060,"2008-02-03",3.8,"June 2006 - Im almost ready to pack the family up and move to Michigan.  Another winner from Bells.  Beer poured cider brown, little head, but decent lacing.  First sip yielded disappointment as the beer just tasted candy sugar sweet.  The flavor mellowed a lot as it warmed, however, as the caramel, fruits and hop bite finish came out nicely.  Rich leathery mouthfeel.  The base flavor wasnt as good as Olde Suffolk, but the hop finish made up for it.","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"

3060,"2008-01-21",4.1,"Batch 7695, consumed January 2008.  Pours a very dark chocolate brown to mahogany body.  A large, frothy tan head settles slowly to a murky, bubbly, blanket of foam.  Huge, random flares of lacing are displayed prominently on the glass.  The aroma is rich and decadent, with gobs of boozy malts seeping from deep within.  Massive notes of caramel intertwine with nougat, chocolate, bourbon, oak and vanilla.  The layering effect is remarkable, as the scents seem to hit in waves, ending with a bit of alcohol soaked figs and cherries.  The flavor is similar, though not quite as well defined.  Caramel, nougat, and bourbon are all present.  They are accompanied by brown sugar, old leather, earthy hops, and dark fruits.  The taste is slightly muddled, and not as crisp as the nose.  Still, this is an excellent slow sipper.  The nearly full mouthfeel finishes long, smooth and warm.  I spent almost an hour with this bottle, and I savored every last drop.  Excellent brew from an excellent brewery.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
3060,"2008-01-16",3.8,"To preface: My rating is based on what this beer is now and not how it is a few years down the road. I know what it should become and thats what makes this fun. A light brown colored barley wine with a small head that fades rather quickly. Scents of dry, tart apple, toffee and a very earthy essence. Taste is incohesive. I get some earthy/leathery/brown sugar qualities, but nothing really definitive. The warmth of the alcohol really shines through. This baby is young and needs time to mellow. It has great character now; enough to realize what lay ahead. Full bodied, for good measure. The dryness will fade and the sharpness will too. An outstanding beverage.","Blowing Rock, North Carolina, USA","BleacherBum"
3060,"2008-01-13",4.0,"Nice and earthy barleywine. This one would really be something fantastic with aging, as now it is all flavors that need budding. There are some fruity essences of cherries, red delicious apple, and plum, but they arent sweet yet and instead the main tastes are these earthy smoke, dirt, leather, and leaf tastes that are very different. Its a nice change, and a great beer, but if youre expecting the sweet explosion of a well aged barley wine you should cellar this or look elsewhere. Still a great beer, just very different if you go into it thinking this is a barley wine.","Maryland, USA","Skeegle"
3060,"2008-01-06",4.2,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (batch 7800) and served in a snifter.  This barley wine poured a muddy brown with a short lived head of beige foam.  A fair amount of oily, slippery lacing was left around the glass.  The aroma of the beer was made up of rich caramel, brown sugar, light molasses, very sweet toffee, and caramel covered red apples.  Very nice!  The flavor consisted of dark fruits, brown sugar, chewy caramel and toffee, nuts, light maple syrup, and a touch of warming alcohol.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and oily with very light carbonation.  Very tasty and a great drink for cold winter weather.  An excellent barley wine from Bells.","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

Mouthfeel is par for the course and alcohol is well concealed. A malty complex flavor is presented here with suggestions of leather, meat, toffee, smoke, tobacco, brown sugar, ripe fruits, and a lingering non-descript bitterness that balances everything out. This reminds me a bit of HoD Adam, though leaning more towards the caramelly sweetness which can be found in a barleywine. Quite delicious.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

3060,"2007-12-28",3.9,"12oz bottle shared with ealdent. Pours a deep amber with touches of brown and red. A large, off-white head floats atop, relatively long-lived. The aroma is complex and strong. Caramel, malts, and alcohol hit first. Then there are other notes that add complexity to the nose - mostly fruity and estery. The flavor follows the nose. It starts with a noticeable tinge of alcohol accompanying strong but complex sweetness - a spicy malt profile with loads of caramel. There are also some fruit and earthy hops hiding in there, which grow towards mid-palate. The finish is somewhat dry with a balancing level of bitterness - but it still maintains an overall orientation towards malts, even in the finish. The mouthfeel seemed a little too spritzy at first, but as the beer warmed slightly, either I got used to it or it lost its fizz enough for me to notice - it finished with a nice texture, medium-to-full in body. Overall, a complex and interesting barleywine.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

3060,"2007-12-27",3.6,"The aroma was deeply malty with of all things a coconut character when first poured into the glass. As the head fell and the beer warmed a nice nutty and toasty character coupled to a strong caramel presence began to emerge. The beer poured into the glass hazy amber with a beige low tight bubbled head which laced the glass. The flavor was malty with a substantial level of bittering which kept the malt in check. The hop flavor was earthy and a bit muddy. The malt back bone was well done, but the flavor was not well defined, perhaps a batch issue, this one has always been stellar in the past. The finish was dry with lasting bittering long into the aftertaste. The body was full with a moderate level of carbonation. Something seemed a bit off in this one, another bottle waits in the wings and the review might get a revision, but this one is average at best. 12 ounce bottle.

Rather one dementional.  Taking  a drink, at first you get a very sweet caramel malt along with a little brown sugar, no hop flavor.

Wonderfully mellow, almost medium body, a whisper of carb.  Rich but not sticky or syrupy.  Subtly spiced caramel and red fruits that melt away leaving candied grapefruit peel.

The lacing is spotted and numerous. Flavors are enormous here: robust caramel, BIG caramel, strong oak, a bit overpowering, but redeemable after a few sips. Soft carbonation, huge body. Rich and warming. This beer is quite a mouthful and alcohol is hidden well despite the mouthiness of the body. A roaring fire and snowy night would seem appropriate.

Thick but very drinkable body on the attack, very little carb. Toffee, caramel, some vanilla, lots of grainy sugars all over the attack and mid-palate--they last through the finish and cling to the tongue for a while. This is a lovely little BW but it could probably use some time for these sugars to mellow out; its a bit of a candy bar right now (not sure the vintage).

In the mouth, the malts are both rich and well focused. There are hints of toast and a whole lot of caramel that is balanced out nicely by a large dose of earthy hops.

Caramel, toffee, strong maple syrup, dark fruits, candy, raisin, brown sugar, with a lot of hops still noticeable underneath all that and after all this time.  Tastes the same as it smells.  Full, smooth, thick creamy body.  Some vanilla taste too.  This is sweet, no doubt, but is not cloying, which is great and something Im very picky about in high ABV barley wines.  The hops come through in the taste as well, providing mostly bitterness but some other hop flavors as well.  This is certainly one of the better barleywines Ive ever had.  A nice surprise and a great beer.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
3060,"2007-09-07",4.1,"Pours a murky brownish with a sizeable light tan head that has some very good staying power. Nose is nice and malty with a woody sweetness and a level of complexity that speaks volumes that you hope the flavor can back up. Flavor is beautiful. Nice deep complexities. Touch of alcohol is there for sure. One thing that comes to be after contemplating it for a while is a hint of almonds. Mostly though there is the wood and the ""old"" malty character. Feel has a good level of carbonation and the liquid is just right. In a far stretch of a way, this is like drinking a sherry or medeira that has yet to be ages to perfection, but is almost there.

3060,"2007-08-26",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 2, 2008 Third Coast Old Ale smells like a double Amber Ale with nice raisin accents.  The pour is cloudy amber and lacks hop lace compared to, say, Bigfoot.  The malts have nowhere to hide in this style, and Bells do not disappoint.  This features a massive caramel and pale malt flavor with much residual sweetness, perhaps too much so, without enough citric PNW hop flavor to offset the sweetness.

Overall rating is unchanged, but with age, I dropped the aroma by one point and bumped up the flavor by one. The older bottle lost a bit of its complexity on the nose but gained a smoothness to the flavor that made it very well balanced. After a couple years of cellaring the nose and flavor seem more in sync. Young or aged its an amazing beer. Thanks for sharing this one, Chris.//Batch 7695; October 2006. Pours an opaque molasses with a pitted, frothy, tan head which laces nicely. The aroma is amazing, one of the best Ive ever sampled. Candied apple, pineapple, raisin, plum, and spicy hops with just a hint of alcohol in the background. The mouthfeel is full, creamy, sticky-sweet and soft on the tongue. The flavor is sweet dark fruits (plums/raisins/dates) with a smoky alcohol finish. This one is a bit ""hot"" on the finish, but still an excellent beer.

Aroma is sweet and malty with light brown sugar and nuttiness, raisins and light aroma hops.  Fruity (red berry, grape) with molasses and figs.  Beautiful clear garnet body with a short tanned head.  Taste is richly malty (And very fully malty), sticky but not syrupy, sweet and bitter in nice balance.  Lots of caramel with some toffee and dark figs.  Molasses and raisins dominate the extremely full body, chewy/earthy mf is layered and interesting.  Aftertaste is very dry and bitter with a little kick from hops and alcohol (which is otherwise well-integrated).  Touch of salt.  Grape is there, too, with light cherry and even a little grapefruit.  Hint of citrus on the doughy back end.  After sixteen months, seems to have aged very well.

Its almost good enough just to sniff away on this, but alas it must be tasted. Intense flavor explosion of sweet caramel, candied sugar, floral hops, and even a touch of citrus goodness.

3060,"2007-04-20",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2007 12 oz. bottle split with my dad, from batch #7695. Aroma of rum-flavored chocolate and plums. The plum scent combines with the obvious alcohol smell for a slivovitz-like aroma. Tart, malty smell. Citrus hops evident in aroma after multiple sips. Subtle, appetizing aroma. Pours an amber-tinted, almost maroon, brown color. Cloudy. Large amount of suspended particulate. Small to moderate amount of yellowish tan head that reminds me of frappéd egg yolk. Produces strong lacing. Quite the site to see in the glass. The flavors, like the aroma, are enticingly subtle. The alcohol is noticeable in the taste. Begins bitterly hoppy but finishes with a fruit sweetness. Remarkably and impressively distinct flavors between the start and end of this beer. Pitted fruit tastes: plums and especially apricots. Very interesting and hard to describe flavors. Full-bodied, oily, and syrupy in the palate. Relatively low in carbonation but not unlively. Overall, reminiscent of a carbonated apricot nectar with a splash of equal parts dry vermouth (hops) and rum or brandy (malts). (Not that Ive ever tried that exact mix). I definitely notice the kinship with Two Hearted and Hopslam, yet Third Coast Old Ales greatness is unique. I regret sharing the bottle with my dad. Hes a fellow beer connoisseur, so he both appreciated and enjoyed this offering. I just wish I had more of it to drink myself!

Pennzoil.  Once its in the glass, when held up to a lightbulb, this ale 

has a hue that is burgundy to brown, with some species of particulate 

matter held in suspension.  Looks like the crab nebula.  After trying 

only two beers from Bells, this one and Bells Best Brown Ale, I have come 

to expect nothing but excellence from this brewer, and Third Coast Old 

Ale delivers it in spades.  First impressions: be prepared for an intense 

beer experience.  When I first tasted this recipe, I felt disappointment 

wash over me because I thought the hops were overdone.  But I hadnt 

finished the first glass before becoming a convert.  Indeed, it has a hop 

presence that kicks like a mule, so, if you dont like hops, youd better 

keep pacing the beer aisle for another selection.  If, on the other hand, 

you love hops, youll be in heaven when savoring this brew.  Ill run 

this up the flagpole just to see if anyone will salute:  the better beers 

are not very verbose on their labels.  They dont need to blather on 

endlessly, boring you with regard to why this is the best beer on the 

planet.  The label on Bells Third Coast Old Ale says simply, ""Perfect for 

your cellar, TCOA is strong and rich.  Its caramel malt and long, slow 

finish create an experience as warm and inviting as your favorite 

blanket.""  The wordsmith in charge of that description drove that nail 

all the way home with only one lick from his Estwing.  He could have 

said, ""Delicious, original, unique, "" but didnt.  He let the contents of 

the bottle speak for themselves, and speak they did.  They said, 

""delicious, original, unique.""  Hats off to the guys at Kalamazoo Brewing 

Co. for creating such a wonderful beer.  Dont know what CCR has to do 

with it but, ""Poorboy twangs the rhythm out on his Kalamazoo, and Willie 

goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo.""  Ive been a CCR fan since I was 

12 years old, and have never known what variety of musical instrument a 

Kalamazoo was.  Now I know.  Cheers, and happy quaffing.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","wheresbaldo"

Pours a dark mahogany, with a thin layer of foam that fades quickly to a thin ring. The lacing is very minimal, but it is very sticky.

Smell; lost of dark rich malts. Toffee and and molasses mix with with plums, dates and raisins. Floral and citric hops are present as well, along with a bit of spiciness in the background.

Taste; this is a bit more fruity in the flavor than I was expecting. The plums and dates are present, but theres also hints of cherries and figs. A rich malty toffee and molasses, with a bit of vanilla, fill out the middle, and the finish is bitter, floral and citric hops.

Mouthfeel/Drinkability; the mouthfeel on this is very full bodied, and silky smooth from a relatively low carbonation. As far as the drinkability goes, the only thing holding it back, for me, is the high abv. If it werent for that I could drink this all night long.

3060,"2006-10-27",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 21, 2008 For the finest of winter occasions.  Vintage 2005. Pours to a thick, luminous consistency and color like maple syrup.  Aromas are indulgent.  Caramel, bourbon, honey, wood, molasses, etc.  The most warming tones of anticipation a beer can conjure up.

Wet barrel, cherries, strawberries, iron, sticky toffee, brandy alexander; richly complex with beautiful, restrained sweetness and subtle colors.  Flavor is more oxidized with dominant tones of soil and wet bark, a bit like a dirty brandy; quite vinous and lightly tropical underneath with raisins, peaches, berries and orange cream candies.  Mid palate is burly with cardboard oxidation, singed with red pepper and giving a rich spirited heat.  Mouthfeel is soft and earthy, still quite generous and rich, and never even slightly soured; finishes graciously with quiet caramel sweetness and a firm, tannic bitterness.  Gentle.  Sophisticated.

Nine months old, sitting on a shelf in a beer store. Aroma is rich and complex, yet still mellow, with smooth milk chocolate, japanese white rice, fresh gutted pumpkin, lime juice and tequila, some grain alcohol. Gentle noble hops squeeze in there too. Pours a very dark brown ruby with a small, fizzy head. Flavor is a little harsh and bitter, slightly covering up rich caramel malt, liquid candy, anise. Im surprised at the intrusiveness the hops still play. An extremely enjoyable beer, to be sure, Im glad I have 5 more bottles of this to sit on for years.

fairly heavy mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation for an old ale.

would probably fair well with a year in the cellar.

I did enjoy it","Maineville, Ohio, USA","OhioGuzzler"

3060,"2006-07-14",3.8,"Batch #71##: Dark murky ruby red pour with thin head. Aroma is sweet molasses with a bit of pine. Flavor is sweet in the front with a sort of pine tree sap character. Maybe a little vanilla is popping up. Cinnamon? A bit of orange rind. They could call this a Christmas Ale and I would buy in completely. Finish is well balanced with hops and is wonderfuly void of alcohol burn (at only 9%, I guess this is towards the weaker side of the Barley Wine spectrum). However, this also translates in to a somewhat thin mouthful. Id like to try an older vintage of this someday to see if the malts create more complexity.","minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","IPAndy"
3060,"2006-07-13",4.2,"From 12oz Bottle, Batch #6722.  Pours the color of a rubied, fiery orange sunset, topped with a thin layer of orange peel tinted cream head.  Nice lacing on the sides of my snifter glass.  Beautiful honey citrus bouquet, dripping with tangerine zest, strawberries, a light chili spice, and a touch of sprucy hops.  Im also noticing some juicy layers of peach and succulent spiced fig that leaves my mouth watering for my first sip.  Rich, lightly syrupy body and mouthfeel that opens up a flavor barrage flooding across my tongue.  What a sensual experience this is!  Rich, sticky flavors of sherried apricots, brown sugar, and orange peel quickly greets my tongue.  This wave of sweet nectar is soon followed by a second wave of blancing hop bitterness containing suggestions of white grapefruit peel, blue spruce resin, and some sticky melon rind.  The flavor residues take hold and blossom on my tongue, creating a memorable, lasting finish for this unforgettable brew.  Thanks, Tom!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

This was one of them. Very dark ruby. Small layer of off white foam doesnt hang around too long. Nose of sweet caramel/toffee malt, resinous piney hops, dark dried fruits - figs stand out, herbal anise like spice, melons, subtle smoked wood, alcohol. Beautifully complex. Flavors are the same, adding cocoa powder, a blade of grass, and hints of winter spices - like cinnamon or nutmeg, but not exactly. Full, smooth, rich body.

The mouthfeel is smooth and bit slippery.syrupy, though not really as viscous as a barleywine really should be.  Big sweet cloying malt up front in the flavor.  Balanced by oaky and leathery flavors, alcohol, and the gentle, though assertive floral hops.  The finish is sweet yet a bit bitter with some alcohol warming.

This beer has been through a lot of moves, some good storage and some not so good.  Bottle poured into a Melbourne Bros glass, poured straight down to create a medium sized head.  Aroma is raisin and tap water, not watery but literally smells like raisin mixed with NYC tap water.  Its alcoholic raisin of course.  Flavor is surprisingly light, not thick malts, not syruppy, just light alcohol raisin with a light palate.  easy to drink for a barleywine and absolutely no oxidation yet.

Flavor is pretty intense with some sherry-like oxidation creeping in backed by caramel maltiness and moderate alcohol.  Finish is very warming.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, but alot of the stickyness is gone versus the fresher batches leaving a rather dry finish.  Very soft fine carbonation.  Overall, one of my favorite beers to age.

3060,"2006-01-24",5.0,"I love the state of Michigan for many reasons. From its beautiful lakes, its fertile farm lands, to the Motor City. Those are all good reasons to want to visit MI, but as a beer lover, there are about 70 more. Michigan is teeming with brewpubs and breweries, the beer hunting grounds are happy. One brewery in particular, makes this beer lover extremely happy, and that is the Kalamazoo Brewing Company, of Kalamazoo, MI. The owner is a man named Larry Bell, and to us beer lovers, he and his Bells beers, need no introduction. The Kalamazoo Brewing Company has a reputation of being one of the finest micro breweries in the US, and it is personally one of my, if not, my all time favorite brewery. I have visited the Eccentric Cafe, the brewpub attached to the brewery, and toured the brewery on several occasions. One of my favorites(they all are, they dont brew a beer I do not love) is Third Coast Old Ale.

Third Coast Old Ale is a barley wine by style, and it is an outstanding, authentic example. This style of beer is a rich, strong, warming ale, that was called barley wine because its alcoholic strength approached the threshold of wine. This beer is rich and malty, with a big, warming, high octane finish, Third Coast weighs in at over 10% abv. This beer pours to a beautiful, opaque caramel color with a slight tan head, and virtually no carbonation. The nose on this beer is incredible. Waves of malt aromas flood the nose. Sweet malt, caramel, butter scotch, toffee, and ""fresh bread"" malt aromas marry with peppery hints of alcohol. The palate is HUGE, rich and complex. Layers of malt flavors coat the tongue. Sweet malt, toffee, vanilla, fresh bread, and more butter scotch malt flavors. This is a big, hefty brew, the mouth feel is very viscous, syrup like. This beer finishes with more big malt flavor, and a long, warming, high octane burn. Hops are in this beer just to balance, but young, this beer is a bit cloying. 

I suggest that you let this beer age a year or two if you find the sweetness a bit too much. Barley wine is one of the few beer styles that will improve with age. This is a sipping brew, it should be enjoyed as a night cap, or as a beer to sip and savor by a snug fire. This beer is perfect on a cold fall eve, and great in the winter months as a winter warmer as well. I really wouldnt pair this with food, but if you had to, it would be desert. I would match this with creme brulee, or fruit cake.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

As it warms some more fruit and woodiness come out.  Cherry and a bit of white grape flavour as well.

Lovely taste - pretty well balanced (could use a couple of years aging, but still ...) with orange juice and orange rind, alcohol bitterness, woody malt - pretty complex, better as it warms up, quite complex if a bit alcohol-burn-y.

Aroma is alcohol, herbal hops, and plums, maybe some woodiness. Hard to get any more descriptive than that since the alcohol is pretty dominant. Taste is a huge thick blast or caramel malts, rather sweet, blended with dark fruits of cherries and raisins, some vanilla here and there, and finishes somewhat bitter with the herbal hops sucking the tongue of all its moisture. This is a good beer, but when I look back at it, all I rememeber is the initial sweetness, the ending bitterness, and the constant nature of alcohol burn. So, I guess what I am asking for is a bit more complexity to be better satisfied.","Detroit, Michigan, USA","JoshuaB"

Toast, honey, nuts, toffee, and some light vanilla come through in the BIG malt nose.  Alcohol come through pretty good too.  The malt way overpowers any hops that would be present.  Copper orange, and opaque.  No real haed formed to speak of when poured.  If I give it swirl if froths up real good, and fades to a dusting.  Toffee, light chocolate, caramel, and alcohol dominate.  Plenty of bitterness. SWEET.
Very mouth filling and chewy.  Alcohol evident all  the way through.  Personally, I could drink this every night.  Outstanding beer.  Will re-review after it gets some more conditioning time.  I may need to go buy another sixer for that though.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"

3060,"2005-01-28",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2005 2003 BottleA long awaited reacquaitance with an old friend, that brought me into the glorious world of barleywines. I never gave this beer the proper rating respect when I first tried it, because I was young. But Im so much (beer)older now. Pours a syrupy and dusky amber sunset, with golden fringes, orange middles and a deep pit of murky ruby. This beer is a glorious color, like the first dawn of a Northern Michigan May morning, lacking only a fringe of clouds. Light carbonation percolates on the edges of the glass. Ah, that candied fruit aroma mingled with saccahrin hops, mellowed with time to a gentle breeze of intoxicating and lusty vapors rising from the caldron of sweet gingered malt, cranberry bogs, and fresh dew. Slicing through the fog comes a blow of fresh oyster liquor, lemon thyme, and a hint of kahlua. A devastating blow of aroma. The flavors, the flavors. Such lavicious running caramels and toffee, fresh from the pan the previous days milking, yearning to release the milky butterfats all over my tounge. Never such silkyness and surprise, loaded with the fresh frosting from a pound of butter, fresh creme and that all important lining of a vanilla bean. Here, it plays amongst the roses and tulips, emanating fresh bursts of floral, grasses and a touch of broken White Pine needles in your hand. There are more deviant facets a foot, harder alcohols in the form of braying brandies and scrupulous bourbons, warming the nostrils and tintillating the tounge. A fresh baguette, slathered with sharp young olive oil and spring of oregano round the brew, with memories of freshly aroused yeasts and a bite of wheat cracker. This is a beer train, of grace and civility, with a mouth full of silky seduction and sumptous glowing warmth, rounded with a quick snap of the whip from Mr. Hop, reminding one to pay attention.

3060,"2005-01-03",4.2,"Very dark brown/purple body, gorgeous creamy foamy off-white head that leaves a ring of soapy lacing.  Yeast dusties visible when held up to the light. Chocolate cupcake alongside red wine and pineapple comprise a traditional malty, fruity barleywine aroma with a kick of alcohol at the end.  The first thing I notice when sipping is the rich velvelty mouthfeel - 5 on that.  Otherwise the flavor mirrors the aroma: chocolate cake, brownsugar, winey and syrupy tropical fruit notes.  Long sprucy hop/caramel sweet finish with a short alcohol flast.  This is a good barleywine.  Doesnt have the crazy-ass hops of Old Ruffian or Bigfoot, but rather goes with ""subdued"" hops and yummy sweet flavors.  Ill knock the overall a bit because while this stuff is damn tasty it isnt terribly unique.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"

Strong alcohol nose was a bit overwhelming at first.  Has slight traces of pine and leather in its scent.  The bitterness of hops used in this one does a super job balancing the strong alcohol.

A thick yellowish and tan head tops this one. Aroma is sweet grapes, raisins, maple and oak. Very nice to smell. The taste is bourbon, sherry, pears and some nutmeg in the finish. A dry mouthfeel complients the great character of this brew. It deserves the praise it recieves. Very solid and subtle. I figured since this was relatively green it might be overpowering, but it is very nicely balanced. I am aging a few more.

Malty sweet at first proceeds to a light roastiness with plenty of orange-citrus-pine hop character and a strong and lasting bitterness.

3060,"2004-08-15",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 23, 2011 Original Rating, 8/15/2004.  Dark amber color with lots of sediment floating about underneath a solid layer of tan foam.  The aroma is like carmelized malt.  This looks tasty... Woah, hello alcohol!  The first thing that struck me was the alcohol flavor.  More sweet malts beyond that.  Oddly bitter for a barley wine; I think it detracts from an otherwise excellent brew.  Perhaps some aging is in order.

Batch 7124 (Bottled Nov 14, 2005); Sampled June 14, 2011.  I had been ageing a bottle for an experiment and I figured a great time to crack Third Coast would be while camping in the UP on the shores of Superior.  Dark brown color with no head.  Strong molasses, brown sugar, syrupy aroma, with hints of fruit.  Flavor is mostly a caramel, Munich malt mix.  Light molasses.  Some herbal character and leftover fruitiness.  Solid, though Im not sure I actually like it better aged, at least, this aged.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
3060,"2004-08-14",3.6,"Deep hazy amber brown color, full and fluffy beige head. Great nose, lots of sweet chewy malts, caramel, and quite a few leafy hops. Flavor starts out nice enough, fat and sweet malts then overtaken by this extreme dryness with some bitterness. They dont blend well together at all. The dryness certainly detracts from the palate which starts out smooth and round but finishes in a way that makes drinking it difficult. Some very good elements, its just too bad they make room for the not so good ones. Thanks NorthYorkSammy.","Sanborn, New York, USA","IPFreely"

The finish bring a bit of chocolate,  some hoppyness, and a slight waft of alcohol.

Pours a rich caramel copper color with a medium and very long-lasting head.  Aroma is unbelievable, like smelling an elixar of the gods and yet homey, what ever that means, Im not sure, but it is excellent!   Flavor is caramel, but overpoweringly so, and balanced with a hop bitterness that brings the beer to its style. Actually, this beer transcends the style and approaches a different, in not better, style in its own right.  Body is silky rich and the alcohol is perfectly pitched.

There are thick juicy aromas of aged malts, figs, raisins, and a bit of alcohol at the end. This has a medium body up front, which leads to a fuller mouthfeel in the finish, it almost coats my mouth.  There are lots of dried fruit notes here (fig, and raisin predominantly), but a huge malty contribution is here as well.  The malt goes from a sweet caramel note up front, right through to a dry toasted malt finish.  The hops in this are somewhat restrained, but there is a definite contribution in the flavor, and a hint of bitterness in the finish.  The dry maltiness in the finish is quite intriguing, it is what really jumps out for me.  Right now this beer is a malt lovers dream.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Tastes, yeah, strong. Nice caramel really hits you. Just the right amount of hops. The alcohol is present but it's not in your face. The flavors are rather complex and well-balanced.

Taste: again, to be simple:transcendent. Warm and fruity, good initial hop play on the palate, settling back soon, and letting the malt, dappled with caramel and fruit, take charge, washes over the palate with every sip, juicy and generous with flavor, and alcohol eventually inches in, 1/3 through. Sublime balance, never too strong, but never, ever flagging in flavor. Full bodied, eternal finish, extreme satisfaction.

3060,"2004-01-06",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2006 RE-RATE.  3/15/06.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, bought at The Party Source in Bellevue, KY 5/25/04.  Rated blind.  2002 Vintage.  Murky brown with a touch of orange shady, mostly dark.  Solidly dense cream-tan head with patches of broken foam, diminishes to to a thin patty with a rocky, sudsy ring.  Mediocre lacing that breaks in large clumps, but theres great sub-surface lacing to impress.  Very impressive aroma of rich, sweet caramel and fuzzy hints of butterscotch, almost like butterscotch-soaked hop leaves.  A bit of soggy earthiness, zesty herbal brightness, and alcohol to outline the fuzz.  The initial taste gives a flash-swirl of juicy caramel that is positively intoxicating, but its far too quick to subside to a prickly, forwardly alcoholic, potently twiggy/piney bitterness.  Theres a soggy, aged malt character that seems like its deteriorating a touch (but which I still enjoy), and theres even still some of that rich caramel-- but it now takes a sad, depressed back seat.  Finish is long but lightly leathery and astringent, decreasingly juicy as it goes along.  Theres also a papery oxidized character that comes to the fore mostly in the finish.  The caramel-alcohol combo is a bit obvious, and the nasal burn from alcohol is clearly evident, but its paired with a minty/menthol character that I quite enjoy.  The softly introduced fuzzy bitterness takes over throughout the beer, even making me appreciate the aroma less as I work through the glass.  Slight hints of smoke with a crackling toastiness that blooms throughout the long finish, together with an interesting but underrepresented figginess that I fight and often struggle to find.  Medium-full body and fuzzy carbonation.  Somewhat of a disappointment once I found out what it was.  I think this bottle has seen some better days. (9/3/7/3/15/3.7)

Aroma is very nice, almost butterscotch but not quite.  The smell of barley wine is one of my favorites in the world-- one of those fantastic smells that is so complex and delicate that its hard to articulate.  This one is no exception.  Very nice, bold sweet malt and caramel flavors.  Bitter enough, complex and long-finishing.  A little bit of fresh, bright hops.  Nice and almost minty along with the butterscotch.  Just a great brew.  Thanks so much Indra!  Cant wait to get more of this stuff. (9/3/9/4/16/4.1)

 Pours a deep murky amber / brown body, with a small rocky cream colored head, big sheet of lacing drape the glass. The aroma is persistent with malt, outsized fruity notes, plums, watermelon, fig, & tangerine, other obvious suggestions of, caramel, clove, grapefruit peel zests. The flavor is a mass of malted caramel and citric hops, complex indeed! 
 The finish is rather sharp, a colossal kick of intensely sweet then illustrates into a bitter camouflage, truly unique….. Palate is creamy and supple, gasps of alcohol warm my esophagus and stomach on the chilliest day FL has had this winter.

Tastes and smells exactly like a barleywine should.  Rich maltiness dominates, nice fruitiness (raisins, dates, dark fruits), spicy hops (no citrus), and some peppery alcohol.  Flavor amtches the aroma.  Full body, medium-low carbonation, some warming from the alcohol.  In my mind, this is an ideal barleywine.  When I visit Ohio for the holiday, I will certainly be picking up some of this.","Boone, North Carolina, USA","Brodie"
3060,"2003-10-12",4.1,"My last bottle from 1999. Murky chocolate brown hue with good off-white head and excellent lace. Aroma is heavy molasses, raisin, apricot and burnt malt. Hints of sugar cookie, earthy yeast, aromatic hops. Minor alcoholic nose. Big fruity sweet taste initially with a dose of bitterness, spiciness and smoke towards the finish. Sticky and oily mouthfeel is accompanied by a warming alcohol presence. The brandy comparision is appropiate. Different from many barley wines as this one is more sublime in it's attempts to overthrow your palate, complex still enough. Very good brew and the aging seemed to work well. I have 2001 and 2002 bottles to compare. Highly recommended.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

The aroma is malty and hoppy.  The taste is malty with a good dry finish and not a sweet as other Barley Wines.  The pallet is only moderately thick for a Barley Wine.  I like the subtlety of this one.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"

Flavor initially is of thick, almost cloying malts, with only bitterness from the hops.  As this beer warms up, the flavors really open up.  Toffee and caramel from the malt, balanced by citrus hops, with notes of orange.  Much, much better when warmer, as brandy notes develop as well.

The aroma is soooo nice, all dark of caramel malt, deep and earthy, very rich with notes of maple, wheat, plum, raisin, dark chocolate, nuts, cookies, and a ever so faint trace of hops. Even the hint of alcohol seems darkened. I could smell this all day, if there was a way I could strap a glass of this to my face just under my nose Id do it!
Hello flavor city! Deep, dark, rich, creamy, everything a growing boy needs. Mostly darkly sweetened caramel malt with rich packed flavors of robust, medium earthy tones throughout. Notes touching on plum and raisin, some maple syrup, dark wheat, and a bit of chocolate in there as well. Absolutely fabulous! Ohh, then theres the beautiful finish of altogether sweetly earthed, perfectly bittering dry of hops just noticeable enough to make your eyebrows raise right off your forehead, so damn nice and perrr.fect! Mustnt forget to throw in the nice little warming quality this has showing up ever so daintily as it gets sucked into your system and every pore in your body screams for more.
Super nice surprisingly light feel, smooth and creamy, lightly dancing mixture of bitterness, sweetness, and dryness. The feel is so surprising for something that seems to come across with so much robustness and heaviness making this unbelievably drinkable beyond comprehension.

From hopped up holy shit!!! to whoa... thats fine, there is useually very little in-between.  This is a pefect balance between the two ends of the spectrum.  This beer is hopped, which, IMHO, is an absolute necessity for hte style.  However, the malt complexity is beyond description.   Caramel, Special B and Brown malt prevail, yet a slight astringency is well placed in this beer.  The beer pours a deep mahogony red wiht a slightly beige or cream head.  The aroma is well balances between hops and malt.  The is evidence of alcohol, but not so pronounced as to throw off the karma-like balance.  Hold on, I need another.  There we go!!!  This beers bitterness is unbelievably masked by the complex and in your face malt layers. Burnt marshmwllows come to mind.  I need a night to sleep on this one.  Will rerate in the morn.

Man, what a beer. Pours out to a cross between a cloudy apple cider and what could pass for liquid caramel. Very slight, light brown head. Taste is very complex. Fruit-like taste, with plums and raisins present and caramel as well. I am not a huge fan of barleywines as their drinkability is tough due to being such big beers, but this one is an exception. You could have several if you wanted to. This is a unique offering from the rest of the Bell's line. The yeast profile is different. Delicious.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","proc"
3060,"2003-03-29",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2003 This brew had a strong fruity alcohol aroma.

3060,"2003-03-22",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2004 I wasnt overly impressed with this beer.  Expected a lot more. 2002 Bottle.  Seems like it was unbalanced, too much sweetness, needs a touch more bitter hops.  Granted it maintains a a port wine-like flavor.  Not a bad barley wine, though it just dosent stand out from the better ones out there, in my opinion.
 7/21/03 on tap at Ashleys in Ann Arbor. Gave it another chance, somewhat better than I recall, though it still seemed a bit monotoned (sweet caramel) and unadventurous. Had a sweet alcohol burn flavor up front with some cherry and other fruit notes, and a grainy malt flavor followed. A good beer, but there is still something missing, sure this is made well, but it lacks any unique character that I look for in barleywine! Maybe third time will be the charm. . . Third time wasnt the charm 2003 bottle. Still a solid beer, but nothing jumps out at me. I would drink it given the choice, but not go out of my way. Ok trying it yet again, head to head with Bigfoot, I can appreciate the slightly better balance and less cellar time needed (bigfoot is almost undrinkable when its young).  Sweet, fairly simple, but good.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Upon opening the bottle, the aroma fills the room with a rich, luxuriant fragrance. It has just the right amount of sweetness and is followed by a hoppy singe to the back of the tongue.

3060,"2003-03-05",4.2,"Found a six-pack for $7.99 which I thought was a bargain considering that these are often sold as individual bottles for $2-$3.

I like this one because it balances the hops well with bready, fruity malts that begin to dominate the palate as the ale warms.  Compare this to Sierra Nevada Bigfoot (very hoppy) and Dogfish Head Immort Ale (sweet and malty).  Third Coast Old Ale is sort of a ""tweener"" between the Sierra Nevada and Dogfish Head versions of barleywine.  Pick this one up if you can find it!","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

Original Rating: Barley wine is not for the weak. It is a pleasure reserved for an elite few--for beer-geeks and other assorted nonconformists and intellectuals. Who else could revel in the opaque reddish brown color? The massive, rocky head and complex lacing worthy of the finest hand-worked masterpiece? What kind of a madman would subject his palate to mind-numbing malts and body-rocking hops? I will and I shall revel in the hint of melon peaking out from behind an aroma of sweet malt and piney hops. My toung will swim through this viscous brew, pausing but a second to notice the fine carbonation and get stuck in sticky molasses and caramel. I welcome the alcohol into my stomach and praise it for its bold nature before initiating conversation. ""Hello good sir. Wont you stay a while?""","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

With the first two sips, I wanted to stop drinking--I was worried that the wonderful aroma and first flavors would be drowned out by a sea of acidic and bitter flaws.  I was wrong.  This drinks like food--toast with butter, molasses beans, caramel desserts, and others.  The alcohol hit me quickly, and it warmed me through, so that by the second half of the bottle I was a submissive and willing enthusiast for the full mix of flavors, aromas, and palate.  It doesn't look like anything special, but on every other account, this is well-rounded, enjoyable, and easy-drinking lesson in barleywine.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

Was a clear color before the bottom of the bottle was poured (when lit from behind it was a clear amber with a red tinge, minus the yeast). Thick light tan head with big bubble. Gradually subsided and left a small amount of lacing. Rich malty aroma with caramel, alcohol, and a light floral hoppiness. Flavor dominated at first by a rich, malty sweetness that was balanced by a hop bitterness. Aftertaste dominated by hops but had some caramel flavors. Slightly acidic and astringent.

How do I love this beer? Let me count the ways.
#1 The aroma - Wow! At room temperature, I can literally smell this ale from five feet away. It""s chock full ""o""  stong, sweet fruit (something I can""t identify, but possibly medley of fruits and berries such as apricots, guava, strawberries, apples, bananas... hey, thats it... a Strawberry/Banana Smoothy or a county fair Caramelled Apple). Also, in the nose is at least an acre of rich barley malt and yeast.
#2 -  The appearance is a crystal clear deep copper hue. The color of a freshly minted Penny. Large, rocky khaki-colored head. Mostly lasting with excellent lacing.
#3 -  The flavor is very malty and moderately sweet up front with blasts of caramel, toffee and toasted nuts. Bananas, strawberries, warm alcohol and a nice hop bite await on the backside.
#4 - The palate is full-bodied with a thick, creamy mouthfeel and lively carbonation. A long, acrid , nicely bitter, alcoholic and dry finish. One last explosion of caramel and fruit at the far end.
Let me count the ways I love this beer? How about eighteen ways... as in an overall score of eighteen out of a possible twenty?

Full bodied and medium acidic.  (11/14/02):  Garnet with minimal head.  Aroma is sweet, fruity -- raisin and cherry.  Flavor is rich, sweet, and very fruity -- the alcohol is very well hidden.  It's a very good beer, but I'll be honest -- I can't see why this is considered a top 50 beer (8/4/8/4/16).","Washington DC, USA","argo0"

3060,"2002-11-06",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 31, 2013 ~2003 bottle sampled on 8/31/13: I found this hiding in the back of the cellar after roughly a decade of sleep.  This one has a label with a space for a batch number to be listed, but no batch number.  There is a neck label. Pours with light carbonation forming a small ring of off-white bubbles around the rim of the glass.  Has a sweet chocolate brownie nose with hints of toffee and light fruits.  Body still has good viscosity and fine carbonation with a healthy dose of bittering hops, still alive and well.  Finishes smooth and bittersweet with only mild oxidation throughout.  This has definitely aged well and makes me sad that it was my last bottle of this vintage.

2003 bottle sampled on 4/18/06: Clear dark ruby mahogany color with a thin-lacing wispy off-white head.  Aroma is richly caramely malty with nice dark fruit complexity and some aged, lightly oxidized character.  Starts with a good sugary caramel sweetness and a complex balance toward a slightly warming, but smooth flavorful finish.  This is really starting to resemble an English barley wine close to Thomas Hardys.

2003 bottle sampled on 5/24/2004: Nicely balanced caramel and hoppy body.  Smooth sweet and complex, a nice barleywine that I prefer fresher.

2002 bottle sampled on 7/19/2003: Pours a dark ruby with a thick fluffy and lacy head.  French bread and cookie dough aroma with some buttery notes and of course hops.  Thick sweet, butterscotch body with lots of IBUs and a dry floral hoppy finish.  Decent complexity throughout, but lacks some balance.  Doesnt mask its alcohol as well as it could either.  Still, a very good barleywine.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3060,"2002-11-04",4.1,"wowee, what a warmer!  At first this seemed very malty, but trying this again, I noticed how hoppy it is - strong grapefruit.

3060,"2002-10-24",4.4,"Deep ruby-red/brown color, nice foamy head.  Okay, folks, the smell of this stuff is incredible as you pour it - grapefruit, nectarine, alcohol, dark malt.

Im really impressed.  6.99 for a six pack and one of the best beers that Ive ever had... the downside... they confused it with Bells Third Coast Ale... the price is like twice that. : (  The alcohol seeps in and has quite a kick to it.  The original flavor is oddly smooth and makes me think of caramel.. .and Bells.  Excellent, excellent choice.

3060,"2002-09-23",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2003 Update:  It has been nearly 10 years since I've had this one.  THe beer that inaugurated my 21st birthday with is still great.  The nose has huge noble barleywine fruit: berries, pineapple, really everything, but with restraint and balance.  One of the finest aromas I've encountered.  The falvor is nearly as good, but doesn't have quite all that fruit (though every 4th swallow or so you'll swear it's there).  Finishes extremely bitter, but not overly dry.  It simply does not need to be that bitter: the malt is well enough in check. Notwithstanding the foregoing, I would consider this a classic.

Old:  This was my favorite beer for years, but unfortunately no longer available in my area.  Incredibly big beer with pine, citrus and tropical fruit, tobacco and berry notes and deep, full bitterness.  I can still remember the flavor exactly seven years on.  I celebrated my 21st birthday with this one--my first legal beer.  Well-chosen, I thought.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"

Thick bodied and creamy, huge sweet caramel like malt profile, grainy and earthy qualities. Piney hops complement the hugeness of the malt wonderfully. Alcohol hit provides some added character and balance to this tasty barelywine. Flavors are upfront and intense but always remains balanced.  One of the better ones out there.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
3060,"2002-09-18",4.6,"This poured out of the bottle with a thick, fine tan head that lasted the entire glass and left strong lace the whole way down.  The color was deep copper and the nose had a huge malt sense with a sour tinge and lots of alcohol.  The initial taste is a dark sweet with burnt caramel and molasses tones.  All the malt is accompanied by a floral hop bitterness that perfectly balances the malts.  This is my new favorite barley wine.  Definitely worth hunting down and I will be cellaring some if I can avoid drinking it.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

High quality barley wine... wasnt ridiculously malty, yet had that nice soothing, warm sweetness that was reminiscent of grape, caramel and slight cherry... aged fruit perhaps... whatever it is, its damn good and you should all try some.

3060,"2002-07-13",4.5,"This is my first Barley Wine (and thanks to this wonderful site, I knew the best to pick, right?) and Im really favorably impressed.  This is quite a thick beer, from the appearance to everything else.  Ive never seen one that looked this thick.  Lots of little particles floating around in a viscous medium.  Dark orange-brown, and quite opaque with all that stuff floating around in there.  Aroma and flavor give much citrus & fruit: peaches, orange, pineapple, and plenty of something else quite familiar that Im sure other raters here can identify by name.  Really big alcohol kick, so not for every occasion.  Smooth and silky, much like Bells Expedtion, though the alcohol is really well-hidden (except of course for that buzz in the head).
