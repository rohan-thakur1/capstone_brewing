More sweet chocolate, strawberry jam, honey, vanilla, soft carbonation, full bodied, creamy texture. Overpowering sweetness, rich, highly complex, beautiful, but a bit too much.

4112,"2016-12-29",4.5,"Damn that awesome. Thick and viscous. Smells like straight up strawberries. Tastes mimics the smell, and you can even get some taste of the seeds. I dont get much barrel though.","Canton, Michigan, USA","lbnlaxer"
4112,"2016-12-27",4.3,"Beautiful dark red mead. Notes of strawberry, white chocolate, honey. Super sweet. Great fruit - easily the best strawberry beverage Ive had. Super jammy. Some white chocolate midway through. Super sweet. Liked it but didnt love it. For my money, the elite Schramms stuff is more nuanced and flavorful.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","jampics"
4112,"2016-12-03",4.6,"Great aroma, great mouthfeel, almost too cloying. Cant drink too much of this in a night, its just too intense.","","Shoegueuze"
4112,"2016-12-03",5.0,"500 mL bottle. Oh my holy fuck. The pour is a dark redddish purple color with a bubble on the edge. The aroma is spectacular. The aroma is tart strawberry honey and lovely sweet and a touch of chocolate. This is just lovely. The flavor is perfect. Tart strawberry, light chocolate, and its like a melted strawberry smoothie. This is fantastic. I love this. The mouth feel is really good. Its coating and lovely strawberry and sexy. This is fucking great.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
4112,"2016-12-03",4.8,"Bottle shared with koleminer20 and Gus, and Benny for the reunion of Meat Cloud and the Bird Dicks. Aroma is strawberry, skins, chocolate, booze, fucking awesome. Appearance is red and brown, deep, fuck. Taste is fucking awesome. Strawberry smoothie. Deep strawberry, chocolate, sweet, delicious, booze, honey, wonderful. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy body, strawberry cream aftertaste. Overall, holy fuck. This is amazing.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
4112,"2016-11-24",4.6,"b2/b3 - both very jammy, much fruitier than the others. Some astringency on the end. B2 had more chocolate and a little bit more mouthfeel.","","knickskicks"
4112,"2016-11-13",3.5,"So glad i tracked this one down, but man Im really disappointed. Hoping I just got a bad bottle or maybe something changed in transit, idk. The aroma was really strange, very strong jammy strawberry, but also a yogurt smell and even oddly like olives? The taste was slightly better, but it still tasted oddly like olive juice. Overripe strawberry, white chocolate, velvetty smooth with a good finish. Sweet and pretty well balanced, but would like a little more acidity. Not bad overall, but didnt live up to the hype for me","","BrandNewBrew"
4112,"2016-11-10",4.5,"Sample from bottle. Thanks to Lukas.Pours still brownish red. Tons of juicy strawberries, vanilla en masse, light chocolate, caramel, honey and more strawberries. Lacks some tartness but still top tier!","Aarhus, DENMARK","bursprak"
4112,"2016-11-07",4.4,"Cest comme un gâteau liquide, chocolaté et fruité avec des cerises, des canneberges, des framboises, de la grenadine, de la confiture. Mon nez pourrait bien se perdre pendant de longues minutes dans ce liquide énorme. Sur mes papilles, une impression de richesse: quelque chose dassez unique entre un hydromel foncé et un gâteau au fromage avec un coulis de petites baies rouges. Miam! En bouche, cette concoction est légèrement collante et sirupeuse. En finale, la catastrophe diabétique est évitée par le travail du chêne et de lalcool. Très très bon dessert.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
4112,"2016-11-05",4.6,"Ceramic bottle shared with a friend. Poured a murky chesnut dark Amber thick colour. Nose is thick organic strawberries, vanilla sweetness, sweet milk chocolate, chocolate strawberry cake, raisins, soft oak. Taste is fresh strawberries, sweet chocolate and honey sweetness. Incredible thick mouthfeel, slight hot finish. Strawberry delight","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
4112,"2016-11-04",4.2,"Sample (2 oz), thanks to kbudd19 for this one! Brown-ish red like a few months old natural raspberry jam leaving intense legs on the glass. Like the other from the White series, the aroma is really intense offering loads of fruits presence (here strawberrries / strawberry jam) and tons of white chocolate as well. Other components are a bit hidden by the intensity of fruits and white chocolate, but theres honey, oak, red wine notes, vanilla and herbal notes as well. Taste is super sweet with medium acidity to balance a bit with again loads of strawberry jam and white chocolate alongside honey, oak, mild herbalness, alcohol and vanilla. Full body. Still. Really jammy and thick mouthfeel with tannic notes. Warming finish. Like the others from the series, I think its an awesome mead and a flavor bomb - its really really good - but its a mead that I could not drink in ""large"" quantity (6 to 8 oz would be the upper limit I think) and it doesnt have the balance and fruit depth of the best Schramms meads despite their score on RB being similar. Wait a minute, am I complaining while I give a 4.2 to this mead?","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
4112,"2016-10-29",4.4,"Bottle. Appearance is still red jam with nice lacing. Aroma is dense strawberry jam, white chocolate, oak, and rhubarb. Taste is sweet strawberry jam, light acid, oak, and wine like undertones. This is one intense mead, that kind of punches you in the face when you first take a sip. Once you settle into it though you start to get the full picture of how good this is. My favourite of the series thus far. Take your time with this and enjoy it as its really one to be savoured.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","kbudd19"
4112,"2016-10-22",4.5,"From bottle thanks a BUNCH Lukas! Pours a pretty brown, dark, oily red. Aroma has straaaaaaaawberry!!!!! Jammy af, vanilla, waffles soaked in jam and that's it!

4112,"2016-10-02",4.4,"50cl ceramic swing top bottle pours with a brown to mahogany colored body that leaves behind some nice legginess. The aroma offers up sweet honey, rich deep berry fruitiness, soft thin vanilla and then a nice fig to date sensation. The taste delivers smooth sweetness leading to berry rich fruitiness that has a clear nectar sweet edge to it. It just gets vanilla and rich berry and strawberry and pure yum! Wow. This is amazing.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4112,"2016-06-07",4.7,"Ceramic flip-top bottle shared at Woodshop 10. This mead was out of control. Clear amber red, deep hue. Nose is absolutely ridiculous with the thickest strawberry jam imaginable. In taste, it has outstanding sweet and sour interplay with tannins for balance. Its super jammy and juicy. Clean finish. This one left me speechless.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

4112,"2016-04-23",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2017 Rhubarb pour, super still. Thick and jammy. Legs clinging to the inside of the glass. Flavor and aroma are fresh picked strawberries, caramel, honey, and a touch of white chocolate.  Get some green leafiness in it also. Slightly tart which offsets the inherent sweetness nicely. Even after a few sips, you feel like you need a toothpick to pick the seeds out of your teeth.  Incredible depth of flavor. The alcohol is present but not at all distracting. Pour this stuff over waffles or pancakes, and wow...you have something special!  Top it with whipped cream...hint of oak, vanilla, and wood.  YUM!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"

4112,"2016-02-03",4.9,"What an amazing Beverage! Straw Berry White is in a class of its own. There just isnt anything else close. All jam, and easily the least chocolate flavor of any of the white series. A slight evolution 6 months past release has made this even better than when it first came out. If you are a fan of world class meads, this is a must have.","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","JJMBeer"
4112,"2016-01-30",4.4,"Ceramic bottle to taster (thanks Dak!). Looks good; a still, translucent dark red berry. Smells and tastes outstanding!

4112,"2015-11-06",4.5,"Bottle thanks to Shad. Mostly clear bronze body, sick legs. Pretty hefty viscosity. Huge jammy aromas, dark fruit, strawberry, port, vinous, light alcohol sweet. Quite decadent, chocolate truffle. Flavors are intense. Yes this is a sweet mead, but well balanced with acid. Strong jammy fruity beers, chocolatey, vanilla, port wine. Mouthcoating, velvety texture. Like all the meads in the Berry White series, this is an exceptional sweet mead.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

4112,"2015-08-11",4.6,"Taster at the meadery. Wow, the sumptuous aroma is bursting with fresh strawberry preserves that deliver a huge jammy punch, wet soil, a lot of sugar, and ground-up seeds. Pours crystal-clear deep amber color with a copper tinge. The taste  damn!  features thick strawberry that completely coats the mouth and is backed by warming alcohol. Rich honey, a faint cheesecake flavor, and hints of oak peek through after a bit. The booze becomes more apparent late but its never too hot. Slightly oily palate with a semi-dry fruity finish. These guys continue to amaze with world-class meads. I didnt think Id enjoy a Superstition mead more than Blue Berry White, but it is their best yet. Im now kicking myself for not buying a White Series box.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
4112,"2015-07-27",4.2,"Amazing strawberry aroma with mild alcohol undertone. Tastes of ripe strawberry balance on the edge of overpowering but are subdued with flavors of vanilla, honey and booze.
