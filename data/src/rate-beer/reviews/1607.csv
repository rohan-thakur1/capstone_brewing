1607,"2013-01-19",3.0,"It  pours clear with a slight greenish tint. The aroma has notes of: green apples, wet-dirt, and alcohol. The taste is light sweet that finishes dry and tart; there are notes of: apples, alcohol, and almond (finish). The palate is medium bodied, with a slight unpleasant astringency , oily, with a medium finish. Overall, its alright.","Ontario, CANADA","chris__hartley"
1607,"2010-10-14",3.6,"One cup can. Fruity, spicy, gingo-ka aroma, lots of fruit. Estery, sweet flavor with peaches, peppery and a bit hot from the alcohol. Tasty and light. A quality ginjo tasting and smelling just at it should.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
1607,"2010-10-04",3.2,"Clear pour with hint of yellow. Light fruit aroma, pear melon and anise popping through. Taste is Anise, rice and yeast with touches of fruit. Good.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
1607,"2010-08-26",3.0,"Bottle listed as Dewazakura Oka Ginjo (15-16%). Pours with a clear, monotone body with some legs. Aroma of pear, melon and cherry, a bit of honey. Decently sweet, very fruit forward. Flavor is also sweet, with melon and then . . . what, half way through a sip, I get a strong ""very cheap"" vodka flavor (think sub $10 for a 1.75L cheap vodka taste). Alcohol is shockingly evident for how clean this smells and how good the first part of the sip tastes. A bit of nail polish and fusel. This alcohol character otherwise ruins a pleasantly fruit forward ginjo. I was thinking of picking up their daiginjo and sparkling, but might hold off after having this one.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1607,"2009-11-16",3.4,"Sampler @ Lux Sushi Andersonville. Cherry Blossom? REally a nice Sake, Poured as all other sakes clear semi thick transparent wter looking annd cold. Smell is citrus, berries and alcohol. Anise taste and berries. Finish is a bit rough, probably the alcohol at 15%. pretty good.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","hombrepalo"
1607,"2009-06-02",3.9,"Taste @ Ichiza, Las Vegas: Crystal clear color with good legs. The nose is bright with anise and herbal citrus notes. Mild impact and a sweeter pleasant taste due to the lower acidity. Very little alcohol notes and the anise smell lingers on well into the tail. Brief finish and a well rounded overall sake. I could drink this all day. A little dry in the distant tail, but its nice and makes you want more. I love it!","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1607,"2008-08-04",3.0,"Clear, very very pale. Sweet, bright apple, pear, and plum and watermelon candies. Alcohol burn.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
1607,"2008-04-15",3.6,"Huge melon and floral aroma.  Very clean and light taste with subtle melon.  Smooth and light.  Would be great on a warm summer day.","Illinois, USA","Kailunkat"
1607,"2007-10-23",3.2,"Clear.  Cantaloupe, sweet fruits, licorice, and a slight alcoholic tinge.  Thick and smooth body.  Intense sweet fruits, with a light, dry alcoholic finish.  The alcohol is not nearly as noticeable as the 15+ percent would lead you to believe.  Enjoyed this one, though Im still learning sake.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
1607,"2006-01-13",3.2,"Crystal clear. Loads of Honeydew and Black licorice in the nose, quite fragrant indeed! Smooth up front, mild licorice flavors giving way to melon and alcohol flavor, like a spiked melon at a country picnic. The combination of a light body and fruity frangrance let you know that this is a Ginjo, not a Junmai-Ginjo. This obviously has some added ethanol.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
1607,"2004-02-23",3.7,"Pretty dry.  Light and with medium butteriness.  Big fruity aroma!!  No alc burn.  Very good.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
