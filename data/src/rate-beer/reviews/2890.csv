2890,"2017-06-04",4.1,"Bottle @ Mikes House. Cloudy golden orange beer with white foam. Big white grape, white wine, and lemon on the nose. Some nice vanilla and oak. Has a nice bit of stone fruit like nectarine and apricot to it as well. There is just a touch of sweetness in the form of vanilla, melon, and stone fruits. Decent enough damp and slightly briny funk. Another nice offering from Sante Adairius.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2890,"2016-06-08",4.1,"750mL shared at Woodshop 10. Clear straw to orange pour with healthy foam. Nose is peach cobbler, rich and inviting. Flavor begins with prickly carbonation, medium acid, slight salty character, ripe peach, angel food cake, with some puckering sourness towards the end. No acetic character thankfully. Comes across as a stonefruit forward sour saison with some of that heaven in a bottle house yeast character from the Cellarman base.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

2890,"2015-06-19",4.1,"Bottle (750 ml). From kcherney, thanks! Split with the Québec crew. 

Appearance: Hazy yellow-golden with a small ring of white foam and some lacing. 

Aroma: Nose is quite lemony with a bit of funk, white wine notes, the Saison yeast is shining through as well, delicate cereals and brettanomyces.

Taste: Moderately tart with bright lemony notes, white wine, brettanomyces, nice funk-ish presence, delicate cereals backbone and a tiny bit of basil. 

Palate: Light to medium body. Medium carbonation. Delicate and clean. Lemony finish. 

Overall: Another Saison from Sante Adairius that is delicate and mightily drinkable while being complex and really flavorful. The barrel treatment is subtle and very well done. Great balance and good work with the cereals. Im also impressed by how the Saison yeast in shining through despite the barrel treatment and the rather strong lemony presence. Nice one!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

2890,"2014-11-26",4.3,"16e bottle. 4 parts Barrel-Aged Cellarman and 1 part Barrel aged saison with Bug Country yeast. Aroma is fruity and peachy with light lemon peel, medium acidic aroma, light oak and very light funk. The beer pours golden color, with slight haze and small white that leaves a layer of bubbles over the liquid. Flavor is funky peach, light melon, lemon peel, vanilla, oaky must, light lacto/yogurt character, medium sweetness, light funk. The body is medium-light with soft carbonation and a full finish. After taste has moderate tartness, moderate fruitiness, some yeast bitterness. Overall, its a creamy and full bodied blend that has a full and fruity finish. The bug country saison on draft was really horsey and dry, but since the blend was mostly BA Cellarman not a whole lot came through. It is not very dry which makes the barrel aging and yeast flavor profile really shine.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
