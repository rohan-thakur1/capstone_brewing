282,"2017-05-27",3.1,"Bevuto freddo (una delle temperature consigliate). Il liquido è chiaro come lacqua. Lintensità olfattiva è normale e la persistenza olfattiva è sufficiente. Il gusto al naso si ritrova nella mela. La prima impressione di intensità in bocca è di sake robusto. Il corpo è rotondo e piuttosto secco. Lintensità gustativa è normale e la persistenza gustativa è sufficiente. Al palato la corposità è media e il retrogusto è di media intensità. Il gusto è piacevole. Le sensazioni boccali finali sono di pronta beva. Il finale è lungo e tende di più al secco. Laroma in bocca riporta sentori di vaniglia, melone e albicocca.","Milano, ITALY","labeerinthum"

282,"2016-08-05",2.3,"So, my first Sake. At Takumi Munich. White color. Aroma is some dried fruits, rice, a bit sweet. Taste is dried fruits and rice again, some ethanol. Flat. Not sure what to think of this. Its quite harsh and alcoholic, I prefer any dry Sherry Ive ever had over this (but thats probably due to my dads Sherry selection), but its not terrible.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"

282,"2014-08-15",3.4,"Drank from the container :D slightly cold. Thought it would be crap but ended up liking it... maybe Im just a fan of sakes. The nose is everything I like about high-quality rice, rich and milky brightness, some honeydew melon, flavour is not hot, I like the almond descriptor so Ill use that. Coconut too. Yeah simple but seems good quality to me.","Phnom Penh, CAMBODIA","WheatKing"
282,"2014-06-03",2.5,"dość przyjemny, słodkawy zapach - lekki kwiaty i las (żywica, rośliny), lekko ostry od alkoholu. kolor przejrzysty, nieznacznie ciemniejszy od czystej wody. w smaku dość pełne, gładkie, z lekkim śliwkowym/morelowym posmakiem. potem wychodzi alkohol, wyczuwalna pod koniec goryczka i lekkie pieczenie w przełyku. za taką cenę daje radę.","POLAND","czlowiekwiadro"
282,"2013-04-01",0.8,"Glass jar bought at a Lawson shop. Clear colour, like water. Aroma has some dried fruits in it but overtaken by alcohol. Flavour is just awful. Of all the good sakes in Japan that cant be rated because I cannot figure out what the labels say this one I can find and I wish I hadnt. At least the jar can be used to store pens in, or so the label claims. Stay away from this one.","Huddinge, SWEDEN","AndySnow"

282,"2013-03-12",2.5,"Grabbed this one for a nightcap on vacation - 16% for under $5, foil top and in its own drinking glass (win, win and win). Clear as water. Sweet rice all the way around with maybe some fruitiness. Hoping this one puts me to sleep.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
282,"2012-08-12",3.6,"A beauty of a sake. Easy, straight with some lemon and juice aromas. Very easy to drink with a bite more taste of alcohol than usual.","Wanne-Eickel, GERMANY","MichaelAwesome"

282,"2012-07-24",3.0,"Cute little $4 thing from Liquor World in Cambridge. Sampled from a Golden Carolus chalice. Not quite clear. Almost has a dirty glass sheen to it.

Caramelized, creamy scent. Slightly sharp with some fruit I cant pinpoint. Vodka notes are unexpectedly, quite minimal.

Creamy banana, mint, cereal, & aerosol. Slight bitterness at the very tip. Very little, if any burn.

Still uncertain.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"
282,"2012-04-24",3.3,"it does look like a cup of water (or vodka), but it tastes great for a cheap cup of 16% alcohol. Its a real cool packaging technique, nothing that I am accustomed to in the USA.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","bpreo"

Rather neutral aroma, a little sweet rice. Medium body, sweet - almost candy like - with booze dominating the finish. Simple and easy Sake. 220410","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"
282,"2010-04-17",1.7,"This was one of these cute Japanese products - found it at a hip little Japanese cafe. The server simply pulled the foil top off and handed the glass to me.  It is supposed to be the best-selling sake in Japan, which probably means that it is the Nippon equivalent of a macrobrew.  It was not very good sake.  It was supposed to be dry, but it was fairly sweet and a little metallic.  Drinkable, but nothing great.","USA","Slipstream"

aroma of mild rice, and some kind of aromatic alcaseltzer.
flavor is rice, mild.  but somehow an aroma or flavor resembling  sweer water blends in, and ruins it all. it is quite faint, but it is there and disturbing me.

282,"2009-10-28",3.9,"Im a little surprized to see only 18 ratings for this.  Its the cheapest sake I could find (100Yen=$1.00), particularly because it is the smallest quantity sake: 180mL.  You would think with an average rating of 2.16 it would be crap.  Oh man do I beg to differ.  I drank it a little chilled, and it was fantastic.  Maybe a light sweetness.  Very mild and easy to drink.  Nuetral flavor so it can go with anything, or with nothing.  Hint of yeast in the aroma.  Clear with a hint of yellow, which is hard to notice.  Excellent!  Maybe I just love sake.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"

282,"2008-01-24",3.8,"Appearance of frozen vodka or thick viscous water. Smells utterly clean and smooth. Slight lychee, if lychee had no sugar. Also coconut water and underripe pear. Mouthfeel is perfect. Not too slick. Not too strong with nary a burn. Served well-chilled. Taste is apples, lychee, and both water and mountain chestnuts. Overall an array of flavors. Complex, smooth, and infinitely enjoyable. Interesting glass jar with re-sealable plastic lid.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"

282,"2006-01-18",2.0,"Well, I suppose that this one is mostly about the gimmick - the bottle is the cup you can drink it out of.  The bottle is clear, so you already know that the sake inside is very clear.  Its a shame that a lot of people that want to try a sake will start with something like this one because of the low price.  It really wasnt all that great.  Body was a little grainy and rough and the alcohol was very much present.  Light sweetness and hints of banana.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
282,"2006-01-02",2.7,"In cup) For a sake, this must a cheap one, ´cause I got this for free at a sushiplace. Compared to the other sakes I´ve had, this one seemed sweeter and less alcoholic. Slightly yellow hue, sugarish aroma, the taste was of sweet rice and straws.","DENMARK","JensenTaster"
282,"2005-09-29",3.0,"This Sake came in a small glass container with a pull ring tin cover and a plastic cap to place over it after wards.  It poured a transparent clear body with no lacing or bubbles.  It had a vinous clear Sake aroma with a clean initial mouth feel and a vinous burning alcohol finish.  The flavor was clean crisp and strongly vinous.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
282,"2005-04-04",1.4,"6.1 oz ""cup"":  Okay, first of all, 1 cup should be about 8 ounces, not 6.1!  After saying that, Im glad it was only 6.1!  Clear, watery looking, w/ alcohol legs on the glass.  Sweet aroma, sort of like buttery vanilla frosting, but with a rubbing alcohol tinge!  Slightly sweet, rice water flavor, alcohol, & thats about it.  Potatoey, vodka like alcohol finish.  Sweet, lingering alcohol aftertaste.  Dry m/f from the alcohol astringency, hot, & watery.  Im not familiar with too many sakes, this being my 2nd one and all, but if this is good, and judging by the other ratings, it isnt, I might not have any more.  Ill keep trying them as long as they dont taste or smell like this one.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"
