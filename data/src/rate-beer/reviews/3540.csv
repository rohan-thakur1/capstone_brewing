3540,"2016-11-26",2.9,"Backlog from Québec RB Gathering June 2016. Muddy yellow-orange with no head and no lacing. Aroma is of tart apricots and not much else, theres mild saltiness and mild oak spiciness but not enough to make the aroma anything else than an unidimensional apricot sour beer. Taste is heavily acidic ala De Garde with genuine apricots flavors, mild herbalness, mild salty presence and oak spiciness. Light body. Low to moderate carbonation. Puckering finish. The apricots flavor is nice and strong but everything else with this beer is wrong... way too acidic/puckering, unidimensional and lack carbonation.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Cloudy yellow with a small white head. Aroma is fruity, spicy and tart with juicy apricots, fruit skins, lemon juice, yoghurt, some spicy notes. Taste is sour, fruity and spicy. Slight salty finish with sour lemon juice, apricot skins, some yoghurt and juicy apricot pulp. Light bodied, average carbonation, slight dry. 
Nice, fruity and slight spicy.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","hackobock"

3540,"2016-10-15",3.6,"Bottle courtesy of milsim. Pours murky apricot colour with a very small white head that doesnt leave any trace on the glass while dissipating. Smell is fruity and spicy with crackers, apricot puree, lemon juice, yoghurt, yellow curry powder, dry soil and lemon zest. Taste is heavy sour, slightly salty and heavy fruity. Mouthfeel is dry, tart, mouth-puckering and medium bodied. Finish is sour and salty with crackers, apricot puree, yoghurt, sea salt, dry soil and lemon zest. That curry smell is really weird. Never realized how close apricots and curry are to eachother in smell. Quite like this but I suspect it was mindblowing fresh.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"

3540,"2016-08-28",4.1,"Bottle share, thanks to Darrel. By far the fruitiest gose Ive ever had, both in the aroma and in the taste. Also the haziest, thickest one a murky orange juice color with lots of suspended particles. Big apricot flavors throughout, just a little saltiness. Plenty of tart pucker. Really good stuff.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
3540,"2016-08-28",4.1,"2016 Boise stone fruit tasting on 8/27. 750ml bottle thanks to Darrel. Pours out a very cloudy orange/golden. Very juicy aroma and taste, and the carbonation couples wit the astringency to provide a very tart, puckering experience. Strong apricot flavor throughout.","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"
3540,"2016-07-29",3.7,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is very fruit forward with quite a nice apricot note. Light citrus and oak notes with a hint of yogurt. 
Pours a very hazy, pale gold color with a small, thin white head that recedes immediately and disappears. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor is fairly acidic with a light citrus note and a hint of sweetness. Moderately strong apricot notes with a light salt note. Hints of oak and tannins from both the oak and apricot skins. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a pretty nice gose. Lots of apricot but perhaps a bit tart for my tastes. The salt is fairly light and accentuates the fruit.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3540,"2016-07-23",3.1,"Bottle 750ml.

3540,"2016-07-19",4.5,"From notes. Enjoyed at Dougs house for the Epic Peach and Apricot debacle of a tasting that happened on July 9. 750 mL bottle. The pour is juicy orangey golden yellow with a thinner white head that dissipates rather quickly. The aroma is excellent. There is a ton of sharp and tart apricots, a blast of salt, and a lovely sourness that just carries it. There is a hint of funk, but for the most part, this is what Id love to see in a gose. The flavor is awesome as well. The apricots start out big and then let the salt move in slightly. There is a sourness and a light funk on the back end that is enough to keep me interested. The mouth feel is spot on. There is a crisp light body and a bright clean carbonation. The aftertaste is lingeringly salty and full of sour apricots. This is an excellent balance of salt and sour fruit. I love this beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3540,"2016-07-17",4.0,"750ml. Yellow orange, looks like a peach apricot smoothie. Lots of fruit medium sour. Touch of funk and salt. Salty apricot aftertaste. Maybe a touch too much salt, otherwise amazing.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"

3540,"2016-06-21",3.1,"Looks like an apricot purée. The bottleneck has tons of dried on fruit. Smells like a sour apricot soup. Whoa. This is intensely sour. Apricot comes in midway and sticks around. Intensely sour.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
3540,"2016-06-21",2.9,"Pours just like some unfiltered apricot juice: sunny cloudy golden with no head and no lacing. Nose is of fuzzy apricots, thats good. Taste is where it gets worse: bracing/really puckering acidity like your average Bu. At least the apricots feel authentic and bring in some sweetness... Really too sour to be enjoyable in large quantities, still. Average body and carbonation. Overall it has some qualities but it is just so hard to drink that I would never seek this one again.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
3540,"2016-06-19",3.1,"My Bottom Line:
This juicy fruit beer is marred by acetic acid and a limp mouthfeel, as funky yeast strives to increase complexity.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-There is no head of foam atop the cloudy beige orange.
-The Gose character is smothered by the apricot juice and the acetic acid.
-There is no texture here. Its just juice and sparse bubbling.
-Apricot flavors are pleasantly outlined from aroma to finish.
-I cannot understand the ratings this brewery has been getting. Oh well, more for the rest of you.

3540,"2016-02-10",4.4,"Bottle, huge thanks to Bobby (Kbhess84) for sharing on 2/5/16.Soupy, bright orange, apricot puree appearance is topped by an apricot-flecked off-white head that shows low retention.Jesus. De Garde does not F**K around with fruited beers. This is just pure, unadulterated, fresh, authentic, apricot goodness in a glass. Massive, massive nose, hugely sniffable with very light tannins and lactic character behind it, though definitely with the stress put on the apricot, as it should be. No alcohol, no flaws.And in the flavor, just as with the last De Garde I had, after smelling the nose, I thought there was no way the beer couldnt be a massively sweet, hugely fruity mess. But its not. Still dry and very well-attenuated, but with tight carbonation and delightfully bright, clean, perfectly extracted fruit flavors. Oak and acid join the mix and theres a pleasant homogenity between the fruit acidity and the yeast/bacteria acidity. Deliciously lip-smacking to the very end.I suppose I get the ""Its too one-sided with the fruit dominance"" comments, but the sourness is still there, as is the oak and if you cant appreciate fruit done this well, well, you shouldnt be buying/drinking/rating fruit beers.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3540,"2015-12-07",4.1,"Dégustée en compagnie de Cédrick. La bière dans mon ballon est orange, dense, rayonnante, complètement opaque et brillante tel le Soleil du Midi. Vraiment un look rayonnant et sublime! Aucune mousse cela dit, mais une effervescence qui pique loeil et qui trahit une rare vigueur! Un nez dabricots séchés et de noyaux dont lintensité en fruit est difficile à égaler. Aucune trace de houblons ni de malts, de céréales ou de cultivars. Rien. Cest de labricot, point à la ligne! Dune incroyable acidité et ponctuée dune vive effervescence, ce breuvage active les glandes salivaires tout en faisant sourire tant cest sûrette. Bonne dose alcaline pour une Gose mais une acidité impropre au style. Je me surprends à trouver cette bière difficile à boire, mais à en redemander tellement son agressivité me plaît.
