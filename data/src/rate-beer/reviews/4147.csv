4147,"2017-04-08",4.0,"Sample thanks to Lukas. Pours deep mahogany. Aroma of sweet dates, sweet dark fruits, honey, coffee, vanilla and weak spice. Taste of coffee liquor, vanilla, dark fruits and honey.","Aarhus, DENMARK","RasmusOtt"
4147,"2016-11-08",3.7,"interesting, using dates as a sweetener, tough balance with the honey sweetness. The coffee adds the roastiness that is needed for these sweet flavors. Excellent, as expected.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
4147,"2016-10-19",4.4,"Pretty amazing job of balancing two uber sweet ingredients of dates and honey with rich roasted coffee...quite complex","Oceanside, California, USA","Floydster"
4147,"2016-09-02",4.2,"A dark brown mead with aroma of smooth spiced coffee, dark fruits, molasses, honey final, alcohol warmth, very nice. In mouth, beautiful mix of burned caramel, dark fruits, plums, molasses, coffee grind, musty character, very good and complex. Bottle at meadery.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
4147,"2016-09-02",3.9,"Bottle shared by daknole at RBWG 16: Poured a mahogany brown with bubble to no head. Aroma was a weird coffee and dark fruit. Taste was sweet honey, dark date fruits, nice edgy coffee.","Wasilla, Alaska, USA","SHIG"
4147,"2016-05-06",4.0,"Bottle pours with a clear mohagony colored body that leaves behind some decent legs on the glass. The aroma is full-on cup of coffee thats dark and roasty with a touch of earthiness at the edges. The taste delivers smooth slick sweet honey flowing straight into a modest degree of sweetened dark roasted coffee. The more I drink the more I sense the richness of the coffee amid the smooth slick honey sweetness. Its not as coffee intense as B. Nektar Chazzano but still plenty tasty.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4147,"2016-03-25",4.0,"Bottle share at RBB. Pour is deep dark purple with nice magenta lacing. Aroma and flavor of plums, sweet grapes, earth, honey, and a touch of coffee. Finish is sugary fruit and a bit of oak for balance.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Dfonorow"
4147,"2016-02-28",3.7,"Bottle @ RBWG 2016. Thanks, Dak. Sort of a mahogany colored liquid here. The coffee really comes through a lot. Sweet honey, vanilla, and caramel. I get a nice date sweetness, but the coffee is sort of the star. Maybe a little bit of creme brulee to it. Pretty nice, though a bit intense.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

4147,"2016-02-10",4.5,"Another wonderful Superstition mead. The dates and coffee blend wonderfully. It seems like they cant miss on anything they are doing right now.","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","JJMBeer"
4147,"2016-02-02",4.1,"Bottle. Pours brown with no head. The aroma is berries and roast. Medium mouth, very sweet, roast coffee, berry, wood, boozy, really great.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"

Taste is medium to high sweet with notes of burnt sugar, dates and coffee. Full bodied with sticky mouthfeel. Great!","Stockholm, SWEDEN","VsXsV"
4147,"2016-01-30",3.3,"Bottle - Dark coffee roast. Deep brown. Sweetness, coffee and a long light coffee finish. Nose is great, but I want at least a touch of honey somewhere.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
4147,"2016-01-30",3.7,"Bottle to taster (thanks Dak). Looks good; a still and translucent dark cola. Smells of coffee and raspberries with notes of honey in the background; much like Breakfast Magpie. Tastes like it smells, but more coffee forward, with some bitterness from the roast. Some date as well. Mouthfeel is full-bodied. Enjoyable, but smells better than it tastes.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
4147,"2016-01-30",4.3,"Bottle shared. Deep brown black pour. Aroma is really nice coffee, fruity notes, chilies, light booze, very enticing aroma. Taste is sweet, light honey, coffee roasty notes with a spicy aftertaste. Quite tasty.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
4147,"2016-01-30",4.1,"Bottle at RBWG 2016. Dak bringing it! An amazing cherry and coffee nose with some dried fruit. Deep red, still. Just a fucken amazingly sweet awesomeness of coffee and berry and fruit.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
4147,"2016-01-30",4.5,"Coffee.. in aroma and taste, but offset with the earthiness and sweetness from the fig combined with the honey. well done","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","shadbow"
4147,"2016-01-19",4.2,"Draft. Really interesting flavor: baked dates, nutty coffee beans, vanilla, berry syrup. Sweetness is actually kept in check and is nicely balanced by the medium roast beans. Alcohol isnt super noticeable. Extremely dense flavor, rich and complex. Only need about three ounces to get the whole picture.","","PartyFowle"
4147,"2016-01-19",4.5,"Sampled at the source. Deep clear purple color. Aroma of tannic dark red grapes. Taste is dry tart cherry and red wine. My favorite of the bunch.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
4147,"2015-10-11",4.8,"On first tast, Ill admit I had to do a 2nd take. Get past that, and this mead is one of the best Ive had from them, and I think Ive had all of them. Sweet, coffee, and it just forms a beautiful collaboration in my mouth. Give me more !!","Arizona, USA","kcorum10"
4147,"2015-09-24",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2016 Smells like coffee and dates. Taste is heavy dates with a bit of coffee and coffee candy taste. Thicker texture.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
4147,"2015-09-24",4.6,"Dark brown pour. And holy déjà vu. My grandma had candies in her jar that tasted EXACTLY like this! Super sweet toffee, coffee, maybe a hint of vanilla. Crazy how much this takes me back in time.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
4147,"2015-08-08",4.4,"Appearance is deep dark amber, aroma of fresh brewed coffee and honey. Sweet dates and honey up front and finishes with dark roasted coffee and honey sweetness that coats the tongue. A very unique mead.","Arizona, USA","SmoketreeBrewr"
4147,"2015-08-01",4.5,"I cant say Ive ever even tried dates but this mead has an amazing aroma and the flavor is beautiful from start to finish from the coffee to the Belgium dark through the dates....excellent","Prescott, USA","Clay180"
4147,"2015-07-27",3.8,"Dark in color with caramelized sugar and coffee nose. As a big fan of the Dancing Goat and Safeword this mead is brilliant and stands strongly on its own with the addition of the dates as somewhat sweet nutty finish complements the slight bitterness of the coffee.","Prescott, Arizona, USA","jesterthedog1"
4147,"2015-07-26",5.0,"Its Safeword mellowed out with coffee and dates. The name is perfect. Smooth palate with good strong coffee notes. The dates hit at the end and make a strong finish.","Prescott Valley, ","Jbarnum"
4147,"2015-07-26",4.1,"Tap. Hazy chestnut, still. Aroma is hella coffee that drowns out all else. Flavor is really sweet, Kahlua, dark fruits, brown sugar, coffee surprisingly more muted than aroma. Medium body. Tasty as shit.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
