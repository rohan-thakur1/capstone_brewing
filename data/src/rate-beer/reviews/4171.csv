4171,"2017-01-07",3.4,"Deep brown body with a beige head that is not that big, but its fully lasting and it laces the glass well. Sweet, malty and quite strong aroma that is dominated by caramel, also plenty of dark dried fruits. Some chocolate in the back, along with some surprising hoppy notes of pine. The strong flavour follows the aroma, with additional notes of alcohol and spices. Moderate sweet and moderate to light bitter taste. Mid-bodied, rather oily mouthfeel, and it actually dries up a bit in the finish. A nice dunkler buck that has more bitterness, less sweetness and more hops than a typical example of this style.

Litt alkohol i smaken også dessverre.

4171,"2016-12-22",3.7,"500ml bottle bought at Vinmonopolet Sentrum Tromsø. Pours a clear copper coloured body under a remaining beige head leaving crocheted lacing all over the glass. Hazy last pour. Inviting aroma of toffee and caramel. Mid-sweet flavours of caramel malts and chocolate supported by a backdrop of dried fruits, included figs. Mild roasted ending. Fine bodied and not overly sweet. Mostly hidden alcohol. A well made version of the style.

4171,"2016-12-17",3.5,"0.5l bottle, unfortunately no batch number on this. In th glass this one pours a deeper dark bronze colored body with a nice medium sized beigeish head - lots of nice dots and lacings on the glass. It smells mild. Was expecting a sour woody vinegar punch, but got absolutely none of that. Its more chocolaty, and almost a little sweet actually. Traces of blueberry, some dark malts and a mild pleasant malty sweetness. It has a mild oily texture in the mouth and its below average on the carbonation. Nice flavors. Traces of licorice and chocolate. A little roastiness also. Sweetish caramel. Its not metallic in any way this big plus. Yeah, this was a ice little surprise from Drammen. I was expecting a sour, got a well crafted lager. 17.12.2016","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Taste is grains, caramel, toffee and hints of bread crust, chocolate, faint sulfur and brown bread. Medium body, medium to high carbonation.
