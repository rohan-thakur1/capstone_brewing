3657,"2015-05-17",4.8,"750 mL bottle shared with ebone1988. Had this one before, finally rating it. The pour is a dark dark ruby, tons of sediment lurking, with a light khaki colored head that falls to a film while offering some great lace. The aroma is beautiful. There is a wonderful dark fruit presence with molasses and a sweet maltiness. The barrel offers a great bourbon character and a lot of vanilla on the back end. It's a little boozy on the back, but really good. The flavor is damn good. There is some molasses and a lot of dark fruits up front. The booze is a little hot on the beginning, but it really mellows out as the other flavors move in. Maple is present here over the nose. The bourbon gives way in lieu of vanilla, molasses, dark fruits, and a beautiful malt. The mouth feel is spot on. There is a great viscous creaminess and a soft carbonation that lets it stick to the palate. The aftertaste is lingeringly warming and full of vanilla and molasses and a touch of maple. Damn.

3657,"2014-10-18",4.2,"Transfer from BA review on 5-8-14-

 Poured from bottle into a snifter

 Appearance  The beer pours a crystal clear deep amber color with a one finger head of off white foam. The head fades rather fast leaving a great level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. The thick body of the brew is foreshadowed by swirling the brew in the glass, as one can see thick fingers of liquid clinging to the sides with them very slowly settling back to the bottom of the snifter.

 Smell  A big caramel aroma is present in the nose with other sweet smells of vanilla and toffee. Some maple syrup and darker fruits aromas are present as well, upping the sweetness of the brews aroma. Along with the big sugary sweet smells comes along plenty of hot boozy smells with a strong bourbon and woody smell.

 Taste  The taste begins just as the nose would have suggested; with a big sweet caramel flavor. Right from start there is also a maple syrup flavor as well as some bready tastes. Some darker fruit flavors of raisin and plum with some other roasted malt taste also quickly come to the tongue with the mix of flavors largely acting as a base for the brew. As the flavor advances from the initial, it gains a bit of butterinesss with the caramel transitioning to a toffee flavor to some extent. Boozy flavors of a rum like nature start coming to the tongue more toward the middle of the taste, starting out lighter, but by the end of the taste growing rather strong. Other flavors of a more woody and oaky nature really pick it up toward the end of the taste, and with a surge of the maple syrup and a light bourbon flavor joining the rum, one is left with a very warming and rather sweet flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is thicker and sticky with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. Both are very nice for the sugary sweet (caramel, toffee, maple syrup) and boozy flavor of the brew and make for a very nice slow sipper.

 Overall  A robustly sweet and very tasty beer indeed. Tons of sugary tastes with a moderate dose of booze present as well, but yet still managing to maintain a decent balance for the style.","","Darkmagus82"

The flavor is just fantastic. The old ale, bourbon, and maple syrup, which I thought may be oversweet, blend together perfectly. Soooo stinkin delicious.

There is some barrel, maple, vanilla and dark fruits there, but its a bit more in the back.

3657,"2014-02-10",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2014 [Bottle / 1 year old] Deep amber tones with copper highlights, very nice clarity from top to bottom. The cap has an eggshell tint to it, lasting for a decent amount of time & leaving a little bit of lacing on its way down. Huge, robust aroma on this one; smooth bourbon, rustic oak, vanilla, mild black licorice, juicy dark fruit, booze-soaked figs & raisins, sweet toffee, molasses, & a wonderful kiss of maple syrup bringing up the rear. Strong, boozy, warming, & powerful. The taste has even more figs, raisins, & dates, soaked in bourbon & dipped in a brown sugar bath, drizzles with molasses & old maple syrup. Sticky toffee in the finish with a huge bourbon presence, plenty of oak, & a wonderful vanillin induction. Make no mistake - this is a HEAVY beer that seems even bigger than 11.9% ABV (even being one year old)... but I thought the flavors were on point, & this was just the improvement the regular Old Ale needed. Bravo!

[Bottle / 2 years old] Thanks, Josh! Glad to be able to try this again, to see how it is handling time. Still pretty potent, even for being two years old. Maple is definitely fading & a light bit of oxidation is setting in, but not quite enough to become a hindrance... yet.

Pours lightly hazy ruby red color with a 1 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lasts.  Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass.  Aromas of big caramel, maple syrup, bourbon, raisin, fig, molasses, toast, toffee, brown sugar, herbal earthiness, oak, leather, pepper, light vanilla, and light coconut.  Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of barrel character and malt notes; hardly any alcohol presence.  Taste of big caramel, molasses, maple syrup, toast, toffee, bourbon, raisin, fig, vanilla, oak, pepper, herbal earthiness, leather, and light coconut.  Lingering notes of caramel, maple syrup, molasses, toast, toffee, raisin, fig, bourbon, vanilla, oak, pepper, leather, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a while.  Fantastic balance and complexity of robust malt flavor with well balanced barrel character; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish.  Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel that is nice.  Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish.  Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged old ale.  Fantastic complexity and balance of malt and barrel flavors; and moderately smooth to sip on.

There is also a hint of flowers. The barrel rounds it out nicely. The finish is long and malty with distinct barrel notes. On the palate, it is medium in body with a smooth, syrupy texture and soft carbonation.

T: The maple syrup really shows itself in the taste. Its very sweet, but its balanced by the light bourbon and oak. Also some nice dark fruits and pale malts show themselves. Smalls hints of tobacco.

M: Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Sweet syrup finish that is a tad dry.

O: It was really sweet from the maple and the boubon took a back seat, but it was very good overall and the booze was very well hidden. I see this syndrom appearing with CBS as well where the bourbon isnt that present and the maple sort of takes over. Either way, both are great.

Reading my review, youd expect this to be killer sweet, but somehow it wasnt. Surprisingly balanced, very nice.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

3657,"2012-08-13",3.4,"Poured into a snifter. 

3.5 A: Well hazed plum color. Two fingers of frothy beige head. Retention is below average, even for the ABV, but a decent lattice of lacing is left.

4.5 S: The maple syrup is huge in this. Its about twice as potent as in CBS. Molasses follows, then raisin, plum, tobacco, and apple fruitiness. The bourbon influence is minimal, but it does add an extra layer of complexity along with some oak. Plenty of caramel and a bit of toffee. Smells great and the alcohol is well hidden.

3.5 T: The taste is taken over by raisin and tobacco, which even pushed aside the maple syrup. Following those, molasses, plum, apple, oak, and maple syrup are found. The bourbon is a good bit stronger in the taste and it brings along a booziness that is expected with a 12% brew. The reason that I dont like this more is because it is pretty damn sweet. Not Bruery sweet, but sweeter than it needs to be. Otherwise, it is tasty.

3.5 M: Heavy body. Good moderate carbonation. Reasonably creamy, but its a bit syruppy as well and gives a hefty chewiness.

3.5 D: Its tasty, but I wish it fermented out a bit more. Love the flavors, but just too much sweetness.

Serving type: bottle

3657,"2012-07-28",3.5,"Poured from a bottle sent by Tooch4321. Thanks! Poured into a brandy snifter at room temperature. Pours a ruddy brown color, nearly the color of rust. Almost no head or carbonation. In the aroma I get some complex raisin, figs, bourbon, molasses, and sherry notes. The taste was initially a kick in the face and primarily bourbon. The barrel really took this beer over. I tried the beer by itself at first, and then paired it up against regular Old Curmudgeon, and then had a cigar with all of them. In this case, regular Old Curmudgeon won my vote.

Pours a deep, dark burnt orange color with tangerine edges and a two finger, frothy yellowish-beige head that very slowly settles into a lasting ring.  Soapy lacing left behind.

Sweet boozy aroma with a pretty strong barrel presence.  Lots of earthy oak, maple and bourbon along with some leathery malts, toffee and hazelnut. Oak is strongest element which is surprising.  As it warns, the molasses character comes out and meshes nicely with the maple.  Still, the nose is surprisingly a bit bland with too strong of an oak presence for my liking.

Medium bodied with lots of boozy heat and a strong barrel presence.  Dominant dry oak flavor with booze and sweet maple notes.  Underneath, there is some more booze and leathery malt.  Sweetness kicks in as it warns with hints of toffee, caramel and hazelnut. Dry and spicy with subtle molasses.  Still pretty hot however and a bit harsh.  6oz is plenty.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

With all the cool flavors the beer aspect of this drink has; it is a shame too much barrel time has pretty much wiped them out.

Some noticeable alcohol that becomes a little less prevalent with continued sipping.  To me, this one could use some time in the cellar.  The wood/barrel aspects are still a bit raw.  The maple syrup/bourbon flavors do add to the beer, though, and should be great given some time.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"

A - Clear dark red/orange body. 2 finger off-white head, very fluffy with large bubbles. Great lacing and retention.

S - I could smell the sweetness immediately after opening the beer. Super sweet toffee malts with lighter bourbon notes of vanilla and oak. A fruit aroma is also very present, I cant put my finger on it exactly buts is similar to a caramel apple. Some lingering dark fruits, brown sugar and molasses. I cant really detect any maple.

T - This beer starts off with a toffee malt flavor that youll find in any good old ale. This is followed by a super sweet yet smooth wave of molasses and maple. Complex notes of leather, oak, vanilla, and butterscotch finish the beer off. Lightly bitter with a huge sweetness present through the entire sip. Super decadent and rich but I dont find it to be cloying at all. Alcohol heat is present as it warms up but never offensive. Mouth feel is medium bodied and a bit syrupy with low carbonation. Matches the flavor profile perfectly.

3657,"2012-03-27",4.3,"After pouring into my seventeen ounce snifter, I am able to detect in descending intensity: caramel, leather, alcohol, butterscotch, vanilla, and woodiness.  The ale is a crystal clear amber with a two level head of frothiness topped by a much thinner layer of rocky tan bubbles.  A taste enforces the aromas and begins with medium sweetness and finishes only slightly bitter.  It has a medium body with a sticky texture.  The carbonation was quite lively initially, but it softened as it rested.  I am very happy I sprang for a bottle of the Curmudgeons Better Half, the name under which it was released, despite the fact that I could not really detect any maple syrup.  I presume the maple syrup influenced the development of this ale in other ways that have delighted my senses, despite not revealing itself directly.

A - Pours slightly murky copper orange with a small half finger tall off white head leaving very thin streaks of lace down part of the glass.

S - Smells of caramel, toffee, butterscotch, vanilla, oak, brown sugar and the maple syrup from the bourbon barrels. A bit of booze develops toward the end of the glass but it still smells great.

T - Starts off with lots of sweetness - mostly caramel, toffee, butterscotch, brown sugar, etc. - slowly giving way to hints of oak, vanilla and the maple syrup / bourbon from the barrels. The booze is light initially growing stronger and stronger as it sits in the glass. Finish is pretty sweet with a touch of booze burn, lingering on the pallet for some time after consumption.

M - Medium body with a rather sweet flavor and moderate carbonation. The sweetness is strong throughout, lingering long after the finish.

The aroma consist of bourbon, vanilla, butterscotch, ripe plums, and a little bit of wood. As it warmed I feel like Im starting to get the maple syrup in the nose as well.

Malty and sweet up front. I get a little bit of fruit and brown sugar. The bourbon shows itself in the middle and lingers through the finish with a bit of alcohol on the back end. I also get the wood/oak.

Taste: Flushed with a large upfront sweetness of caramelized sugars, brown sugars, and ardent traces of maple. Well-toasted maltiness. Bourbon percolated raisins, then, a bit of zested citrus with a small portion of bitterness and a warming alcohol presence. Nuances of oak wood. Sweetish, warm (though not hot) finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation.

3657,"2012-03-02",3.8,"I finally had the opportunity to sample this beer on tap at a local pub downtown.  Given how much Canadian Breakfast Stout absolutely lived up to the hype, at least for me, I figured this beer was more than worth sniffing out.  Luckily, my palate did not have to wait long.  The beer was served to me and my friend in two bulbous little 6 ounce snifters.  A deep, opaque amber color let little light through as the head spillled over and ran slowly down the glass, leaving a snalelike trail of sticky lacing.  Rounded notes of powdery malt, syrup, treacly vanilla and muted whiskey rose slowly from the glass to greet the nose.  The bourbon barrel flavor in this ale is nowhere near as prevalent as in Founders other BA breakfast stout offerings, KBS and CBS.  In those beers, the maple/bourbon barrel created a synergy with the chocolate and coffee that was astonishing and rich.  With the Kaiser, the maple barrel turned the beer more into a confection than anything else.  As soon as this syrupy treat hits your lips, its like youve slapped on your bib and are about to dive into a decadent pancake breakfast with LOTS of dripping, oozing syrup.  The syrupy sweet character of this beer is reigned in a bit by some flowery hops and drying vanilla notes from the barrel, but it almost goes beyond cloying.  The maple and vanilla from the barrel really come through together and finish the beer with a sticky smack, leaving some toasted malt notes to linger a while in the mouth.  Two 6 oz. pulls of this dessert in a glass were enough for me; I dont know if a third would have been worth the diabetes.  Overall, this a very comforting, warm and delightfully sticky beer with plenty to offer.  However, it doesnt round out the sweetness as much as I wanted it to and also doesnt deliver entirely on the complexity.  Perhaps my expectations were to high and inconsistent with the other Backstage offerings.  Im left wanting more out of the beer and needing to brush my teeth from the sugar.","Pennsylvania, USA","bosendorfer"

A - Half a finger of very creamy head. The brew was deep tan with a healthy amount of sediment floating around.

S - Sweet bourbon was my first though. Think of a very watered down old fashioned. Wood notes were a combo of oak and maple. Of course maple syrup was coming through as well.

T - Wood, whiskey (specifically bourbon), maple but all of the flavors were muted. Very weak, bland and almost running away from my taste buds. Someone made a great beer and threw a gallon of sewer water in it.

M - 50/50 bubbles on a swish. Its a very boozy beer and the linger is a very burned and roasted maple syrup taste. Trust me, I live in New Hampshire. I know burnt syrup.

a - filled my cbs snifter. poured a ruby chestnut that was semi-transparent. nice frothy thick head that left big streaks of lacing on my swirled glass.

s - strong sweet maple syrup. brown sugar to the max. definitely has that same old curmudgeon crossed with backwoods that i picked up in the draft version, but way more maple. sweet potpouri.

t - wonderful sweet caramel brown sugar. the barrel and maple syrup really take the old ale on a wild ride. this is the treatment that was needed for this beer. really well blended. if anything, a bit sweet, but super palatable. dare i say that this might be better than BB4D.

m - extremely smooth and easy to drink for the intense booze and sweetness that youd expect.

o - overall, this is amazing. founders does it again. this was the sleeper as kaiser curmudgeon and a treat. i had heard black biscuit would be next, but super pumped for this one. glad it fell a bit under the radar for these releases...at least wasnt as crazy as CBS. a winner and a half. fantastic brew. as world class as BB4D...and the only old ale that should be mentioned in the same breathe.","New York, USA","cosmicevan"

I said, ""Oh, Im going to drink it.""
I guess if this beer is hard to find, its because of the black market. Not unlike trying to get bleacher tickets to Cubs - Cardinals game at Wrigley on a Saturday in June.
Anyway, this beer starts off hot. Alcohol in the aroma and a strong alcohol flavor upon first sip.  My taste buds puckered initially, which is odd because this beer is not sour.  
Anyway, this beer turned out to be quite awesome if I do say so myself.  Once it warmed, the flavors came through.  Sweet bourbon flavors melded perfectly with the base of Curmudgeon Old Ale.  I didnt notice any maple flavors, per se, though the sweetness probably had something to do with the maple.  I would go so far as to say this beer is great.  It could be greater though, and I guess thats why the guy at the beer store asked me what I was going to do with it.  This one probably could use a little aging to soften it up.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","Holtguy"
3657,"2012-02-19",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2013 On tap at Founders, because where else was I going to get it? Deep brown color with almost no head.

Overall, Im glad I got a chance to try it. I dont feel like its entirely my bag, so Im not so disappointed that I didnt get a bottle of it. Still, for fans of bourbon barrel stuff, and really sweet beers, this would be one to try to find if you can.
Update: I actually did snag a bottle somehow, and sat on it for about 9 months. Aged mellowed the harshest of the alcohol notes, bringing to the fore a lot of the maple and bourbon and making for a really nice experience.

Quite drinkable despite the sweetness.  Still not much barrels or maple in the taste.  Strangely I thought it was more drinkable than the boring regular Curmudgeon.

Vanilla, caramel, citrus, bourbon, and booze fill out the nose, very rich aroma. Medium/heavy mothfeel. Carmel, maple, vanilla flavors abound in this one.

The flavor is pretty much Curmudgeon with the addition of more sweetness from the maple barrels.  Medium plus to full bodied; caramel, bourbon, wood, hints of earthy, and sweet maple syrup.  There are hints of alcohol in the taste, but it serves mainly to warm as it goes down.

Aroma of alcohol and maple syrup, almost medicinal, super potent.  Taste makes me shiver.  Super rich and boozey, dominated by the maple syrup and alcohol, as I was writing this I noted - holy hell theres no way I can finish this one and survive the 2 hr drive home through the snow.  Little did I know it wouldve been a 3 hr drive!  But anyways, I couldnt even finish the small sample at the Brewery, just too much alcohol flavor mixed with the maple syrup.

Monster aroma, very sweet and milky, wild fruit, more tropical, maple, vanilla, wood kinda sounds like the others. 
Tastewise this is another super sized brew.  Willl this end? Creeeeeeeeeamy as anything, thick sweet choc and vanilla, wood, not quite syrupy dark fruits, maple, Natives of the new Dawn are just ripping this place apart! What beats this place??? Some alc.  Well, quite boosy. Milky and probably nutty. Its 1:30 and Im trashed. Man this beer is too much of a good thing as I cant see drinking another. Im already totally bloated and this massive sweet bomb is just too much to handle at this point.

3657,"2010-11-16",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 18, 2012 Draft sample at FOBAB 2010.  Pours a clear amber-gold color with almost no head.  Notes of honey, vanilla, caramel, bourbon, mixed fruits, and maple syrup.  Medium-full bodied, with a sticky, syrupy mouthfeel and low carbonation.  Not bad, but very, very sweet.  Good luck drinking a full glass of this anywhere. Re-Rate: Wow, totally forgot about the FOBAB rate. Damn. Thought this was a new one. Got a 750 ml Better Half bottle from stevemastny of BeerDownload fame- thanks again, Steve! Im bumping up my rating on this one from the old 3.4. It still isnt as good as advertised but better than Id said. Pours a nice amber color, mostly clear but with a ton of yeast sediment. The aroma and flavor start subdued, with notes of maple, honey, vanilla, molasses, caramel malts, dried apricots, and wood- pretty one-dimensional. Medium-bodied, with a smooth mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Definite warming booze throughout.
