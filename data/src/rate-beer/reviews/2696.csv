2696,"2016-07-29",4.4,"500 mL growler. Graciously shared by Doug on 9/24/2013.

Brown body with some reddish flecks. Nice off white head. Thick collar and lots of chunks.

Whiskey aroma. Not like bourbon. Spicier and nuttier. Peatier too. Caramel and nutty malts.

Sharp whiskey flavor. Again, its got a spicy flavor. Caramel malt. Very nutty. Im amazed it doesnt have nuts added to it, really. Some chocolate, but its got more of an emphasis on nutty brown malts.

Medium heavy. No carbonation issues. A little boozy.

This barrel is great. The beer is a little masked, but that doesnt bother me so much.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

Lots of flavor also. Its not directly sweet but it has some sweet almost beefy elements that I really like. Surprisingly light oily in the mouth and its prickling on the tongue.

The aroma has huge whiskey and charred oak notes, very earthy, very toffee, very leathery, moderately sherry and figgy, with classic Olden School oxidization. The taste develops a rich malt forefront support by dark fruits and extreme earthy components including oak, smoke and spice. The mouth feel is very lush, oily and sticky as well as warming, a true sipper brew than could have been 15% abv and would not have shocked me in the least. Lovely brew and a fine ENGLISH STRONG ALE, thanks again Eric.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

2696,"2013-09-22",4.2,"Growler - thanks a ton to Doug for bending over backwards to solve a problem! Pours deep brown, clear with a medium creamy tan head that sticks around for a while and laces very well. Aroma is bourbon, dark sugars, dried fruits. Flavor is about the same, sweet and a touch astringent from the wood. Bourbon, wood, dark sugars, dates. Medium body, creamy mouthfeel, quite yummy.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
