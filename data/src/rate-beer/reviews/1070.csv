1070,"2015-01-30",3.3,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2015 This is my first pyder sampled at Beamish Hall Beer Festival. Golden in colour with a few bubbles on the head. Quite sweet on the nose. Fairly dry sand starts of very cider like but aftertaste is definitely perry.  Sampled again at Box at Stowmarket Beer Festival quite fruity in a boiled sweet kind of taste, nice though!","North Yorkshire, ENGLAND","apickles"

Appearance - golden with a little bit of froth on the top.

Taste - sweet apple sauce.

1070,"2012-08-11",3.1,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2013 
Cask @ OHaras Freehouse
Aroma is quite leathery with some earthy notes - but no pear here. Flavour is slightly sweet and rather leathery with some pear and something metallic and fruity I find hard to describe. Becomes rather dry and leathery towards the end of the glass. My first real perry - interesting.","Tampere, FINLAND","laiti"

1070,"2011-02-14",3.4,"From a plastic barrel at Battersea Beer Festival on 10 February 2011 (at 6.5%). Badged simply as Gwynt Y Ddraig Pyder but I guess its the same stuff. Hazy gold colour. Sweetish, with lots of juicy fruit.  Surprisingly petillant, to the extent that it even poured with a small head. Tasty but I would have preferred a very slightly firmer mouthfeel. But I guess that would have required a higher apple content, at the risk of submerging the more delicate pear character. Tricky things to get bang on Id assume, Piders.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
1070,"2010-09-10",3.9,"Cloudy straw colour.  The aroma has rich pear fruitiness with apple nuances and wood accents.  Juicy, full of lively pear juice character, again only a light apple.  Some nice tannins help to balance out the finish.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1070,"2010-09-02",3.9,"Cask @ Swansea Bay Beer Festival 2010. Hazy pale with scant head. Really interesting aroma. Big fruit. I think I smell more apple than pear, but its definitely a blend. Thinner than expected but makes it quite drinkable. Has berry notes. Flavors I think are more pear than apple (although some sips are the opposite). Good touch of cider vinegar acidity for balance. A playful, thoroughly enjoyable drink I could have more of. Quite honored to have been able to try this.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
1070,"2010-03-27",3.5,"On hand-pump at the Southampton Arms, London 25/03/10. Golden with slight carbonation. Aroma of tart apples and sweeter, dessert pears. Easy drinking, with barnyard notes, tart apples and the same, juicy pear notes. Very good combination of two drinks.","Bristol, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","downender"
1070,"2009-07-27",3.1,"[RBESG, Sheffield]
Cask @ Star Inn, Huddersfield.
Pours hazy yellowy green with practically no head. Aroma has pear, some farty notes, red apple sweetness and a slight oaky touch. Low carbonation, fine mouthfeel. Flavour is nice, subdued oak, fair dryness. On the sweet side with red apples and pear, but still quite fine (despite the aroma)","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"
1070,"2009-07-22",3.3,"Cask at Merton Summer Beer and Cider Festival 17-07-09   Pours gold with a great effervesence and a nose that did somehow manage to slot between cider and perry. Taste is sweeter than many ciders and edges more towards perry.  Interesting combination of the two and a drink that Ive never come across before, Its strange and reminds me more of a bottled product, its clean, clear, crisp but has a little sweetness. Nice stuff.  A6 A4 F7 P3 Ov13  3.3","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"
