112,"2017-03-26",4.1,"Bottle shared by AdamChandler, much thanks!! The flavor and the aroma are a direct reflection of each other. Savoy sweet apples without and sugar. Finishes on mild oak and maybe every a slight sour/ tart note. The oak and tart note balance out the sweet apples. This is extremely enjoyable.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
112,"2017-03-13",4.4,"Dark reddish brown. Loads of alcohol legs. Smells of apple butter, ginger and pear. Loads of honey. Peter spice and sweet baked apple. Little cherry as well. Taste, wow. Delicious. Insanely sweet without being cloying. Raspberry and cherry and lemon sour. Wow. This is loaded. Holy crap. Sweet almost sour. Brown sugar. Cheery finish This is an incredible cider. Eden is making the best ice sider south of Quebec.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

112,"2016-09-30",4.5,"Bottle received through the Eden Ice Cider club. Pours clear deep amber leaving some thick legs on the glass with a swirl. Smell is intense with a ripe complex mix of sweet apples, caramel, toffee, raisins, prunes, leather, moist wood, black cherries and calvados. Taste is sweet, sour and heavy fruity. Mouthfeel is soft, viscous, oily, round, tart, tiny tannic astringent, slightly boozy and near full bodied. Finish is sweet and sour with complex oxidized apples and raisins, overripe citrus fruits, caramel, wood, leather, soil and calvados. Crazy rich and intense. Oxidized in a fine sherry way. Unbelievably complex... Wow!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"
112,"2016-09-01",4.4,"A really great ice cider with complex notes of tartness, sweetness, nuanced beverage overall.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
112,"2016-07-18",4.0,"Poured from a 375 ml bottle. 
Aroma is full of rich apple notes with some light tannins. Medium oak notes. A light spiced apple notes. Light oxidation with honey and caramel notes. 
Pours a clear, dark copper color with some amber hues and no head. No lacing and sheets of alcohol with long legs. 
Flavor is fairly sweet with lots of apple notes. Some moderate alcohol notes with some spice character. Quite a bit of caramel and light honey notes. Moderate oak notes. Lots of red apple with some lighter apple skin tannins. 
Mouthfeel is full bodied with no carbonation. Low astringency and medium alcohol warmth. 
Overall, an alright cider but it lacks a bit of the rich complexity that the better ice ciders have. Nice apple notes. Sweet, but not over the top. Oak is fairly prevalent. A bit less impressive than I expected.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
112,"2016-07-04",4.4,"Bottle... Pours lovely and deeply amber with no legs. The aroma is downright floral and perfumey - apple blossoms and red, super-ripe, freshly pressed apples. Full-bodied and silky with rumor of carbonation. The flavor is super fruity and intense, boasting tons of fresh, ripe apples, caramel and a boatload of sour and savory malic acid. Finishes sour, fruity and somewhat dry. Fantastic, world-class ice cider! Bottle courtesy of darkguardian!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
112,"2016-04-29",3.7,"Une robe ambrée et de longues jambes qui senroulent autour de mes yeux. Le nez vibre au son du chêne et des raisins: les pommes gorgées de sucre perdent leur équilibre devant cette acidité tranchante mais bienvenue. Au goût, une barrique qui pique, des pommes aiguisées, un alcool poivré, une douceur complètement effacée. En bouche, un corps gras qui senflamme sur ma langue. La finale est davantage sur lacidité que sur le sucre résiduel. Cidre de glace différent, il va sans dire. Complexe, sans doute mais débalancé. Merci à Julien et Tom pour cette unique chance.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
112,"2016-04-23",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 24, 2016 2 oz sample from tom10101, thank you good sir! Appearance is still golden brown. Aroma is intense Apple, oak, mild oxidation, and honey. Taste is Apple, a touch of oak, golden honey sweetness, and some light acidic undertones. Wow, this is very comeplex and interesting, very different and very nice indeed. Well done.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","kbudd19"
112,"2016-04-19",4.4,"a clear medium dark copper pour, burnt orange and red tint provided by sexy oloroso - some fine legs i would add. obvious yet fully integrated wood barreling notes, remarkably fresh red apples with a very surprising acidity - not only citric and magic that is; lightly buttery strawberries, blueberries, etc. - a berry plethora; some prunes and small dried fruits as well, sweetness characterized by spicy apple-berry jelly; fresh tobacco, perfumey and floral alcohol. flat carbonation, medium body - oily; smooth, warming, sweet, tart(er than many ice ciders) and woodsy-spicy finish. another world-class ice cider by eden - and already mastering ice cider barrel-ageing. stunning balance and pure elegance. much enjoyed!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
112,"2016-04-15",4.3,"3 oz sample from bottle (375 ml) at home. Deep copper leaving some nice sticky legs on the glass. Aroma is intense and rich with loads of wood but also caramelized apples, caramel, pears, plum, earthy/mineral notes, some oak spiciness and nuts. Taste is sweet but well balanced by a sharp acidity, theres some oxidation notes but they add to the flavor profile instead of ampering it with earthy notes, nuts and mushrooms. Theres also a good dose of oak spiciness, a nice caramelized apples and caramel presence, fruits aplenty including plums and pears as well as a tiny bit of alcohol. Full body. Still. Woodsy mouthfeel. Sharp acidity in the finish with lingering but never overpowering nutty and mineral notes. Creating a unique ice cider isnt easy but this one is definitely a success. Like the deScription states, it definitely have some connections with Oloroso (from the very little I know about Oloroso). This isnt in the top-5 ice ciders I have had and its not my best from Eden either (Northern Spy is so amazing) but still its one I enjoyed the most because the uniqueness of the profile and the amazing complexity. Beautiful creation.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
112,"2016-04-14",4.2,"2oz sample, from the bottle. Deep copper red pour, crystal clear. Aroma is rich, fruity plum notes, Palm sugar, extremely woody, caramel apple.

112,"2016-02-20",3.9,"Bottle, pours Clearish red with small head. Notes of cherry, maple, red delicious apple skins, red vino and sugar. Less Apple, and pie than most edens. Really unique but didnt measure up to a Neige offering for my money.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
