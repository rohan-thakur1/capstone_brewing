4360,"2017-03-01",3.8,"Solid black lager, sufficiently dark and roasty, adding a yummy charred malt complexity to its lager fruitiness. Pours a lovely deep brown with ample lace, and the aroma hits a welcome smoky mocha note. Tastes rather stout-like at first, with a massive amount of roasted chocolate blending with an apple and apricot-tinted yeasty backbone, yet it remains surprisingly light for a beer with this much dark malt character. Finishes like semisweet coffee with a breadlike undercurrent. Nice.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

4360,"2014-11-14",3.9,"650 ml bottle served in a pint glass (from notes). 

Pour looks a bit like used motor oil; this is a truly black beer. Completely opaque with an unusually dark brown head that reduces at a moderate rate to a thin ring. 

Aroma: Not strong. Primary component is dark roasted malt. Very sweet, with lots of chocolate/smoky notes. Toasted malt and burnt toast, powdery cocoa, hints of coffee, and molasses. 

T - Some sweetness initially, but certainly not as sweet as a typical German schwarzbier, and the finish is mildly bitter with a clear coffee note. Hints of dark chocolate and licorice. Mainly, theres plenty of rich dark roasted malt flavor that is pronounced and lasting but not challenging. 

M - nice medium-full body with some crispness from carbonation and/or hops.

4360,"2014-08-25",3.9,"Reviewed from notes. 
This was poured into a pilsener glass. 
The appearance was a jet black pour and color. One finger white to off white foamy head graces the top of the beer in a gentle way. As the head dissipated, semi - thick foamy lacing strings its way down the sides of the glass. 
The smell was roasty and sweet with a nice coffee bean to chocolate sweetness. A light bitter edge of coffee to touch the aroma pretty nicely. 
The taste was sweet, roasty and a light bitter from the coffee edge. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat sharp but too much. There was a nice roasty to sweet sharp aftertaste and finish. 
Overall, good Schwarzbier Id have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
4360,"2014-08-24",4.3,"Transfer from BA review on 1-30-13-
 Served on tap in a pint glass

 Appearance  Served a black colored brew with a tiny tan head. The head fades almost instantly leaving a light level of lacing on the sides of the glass.

 Smell- The aroma is strongest of a roasted coffee aroma. Mixed with this is a nice dark chocolate/cocoa smell. A light sweet vanilla and caramel smell are mixed with these roasted and dark aromas balancing them nicely and creating a great smell.

 Taste  The taste begins with some slightly sweeter chocolate and roasted malt notes up front. As the flavors advance further a bit of caramel and some smoky and coffee flavors come to the tongue. These flavors last to the end of the taste where the coffee flavors get stronger and espresso like with the brew also bittering more in nature. These are accompanied by an emergence of some earthy hop flavors. When mixed with the bitter coffee, and roasted malts it creates a very pleasing slightly bitter flavor to linger on the tongue. 

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and chewier side with a carbonation level that is on the average side. The chewier body is fantastic for the roasted and darker flavors of the beer giving is a big and thick feel on the tongue; well matching the coffee and chocolate flavors of the brew.

 Overall- This was one tasty brew. It had the right level of bitter hop and sweetness to complement the darker and roastier chocolate and coffee/espresso flavors of the brew. Well done.","","Darkmagus82"

4360,"2012-09-22",3.8,"2/13/2010 - Power to the beer, and power to the drinker. I love Rogues hard left socialist labeling here, but Im also eager to try my first American made schwarzbier. My European first was a palate expanding experience, and I thought an American take would be similar. As the Schwarz in the style suggests, this is a very black beer, with a deep, dark chocolate shaving colored head, putting up a centimeter and a half of insulation - a feeble attempt to protect it from a thirsty beer rater. The aroma is primarily chocolate, but mild in sweetness. It also feels wet, and has a smell not unlike moss on a damp rock. Theres also a chalky thickness to it, but rich; the Chatoe Rogue First Growth Dirtoir is neither too sweet nor bitter in the nose. This changes in the flavor, where the bitter flavors are amped up, and where the brewers heaved in a LOT of chocolate flavor. The end features some of the beginnings bitterness, but restrains it once the beer has passed to a better place (my gut.) In its place is a lingering, unctuous chocolatey flavor, reverberating for half a minute before it finally shakes itself away. The palate is lighter than I expected considering the dark flavors, but I chalk this up to conditioning. Schwarzbiers tend to be lighter, and like Black IPAs, are novel in some ways for the kinds of flavor they deliver on a lighter palate. Its a straightforward beer, but I like it. It lets me have it all - deep, dark and sinfully sweet flavors on a clean, refreshing palate.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Aroma: The aroma has lots of roasted malts, coffee, a little toast, and some chocolate notes

Appearance: It pours a dark brown-black color with a thick, lasting, lacy foam of brown head

Flavor: It is heavy on roast/burnt malts, with a later dark un-sweetened, slightly acidic coffee bitterness 

Palate: The body is medium, with a soft carbonation, a creamy feel, and a rather dry finish

This is a pretty interesting offering.  It isnt particularly diverse, with the roasted/coffee flavors really dominating, but those flavors are pretty well done, so I guess they didnt need a ton of flavors to make this one shine.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

4360,"2011-07-07",3.8,"When I first cracked this bottle, I was surprised at what I smelled. The effervescence that I experienced had almost a root beer quality to it. The beer itself pours a dark, deep black; almost like a thinned out motor oil. The thin brown head is almost non existent. Just from looking at the beer, one would assume its much stronger than it really is because it pours quite similar to many of the imperial stouts out there (ie. The Abyss).

I still get quite a bit of that root beer pungency on first smell, but chocolate, coffee and graham crackers also show up. The taste is surprisingly crisp and clean (thats the lager yeast for you) with loads of roast coming through on the front, and quite a bit of dark roasted coffee lingering on the back palate. They say on the bottle that they used some ultra crisp coastal water, and the cleanliness of this beer really showcases that.

Smells of chocolate and coffee, slightly earthy with a hint of bread and pine. Almost smells like a stout.
Taste is rich and smooth chocolate and roasted coffee up front. Earthy overtones midway with a hint of pine and slight astringency. Throw in some dark fruits that lead to a dry lingering roasted and hoppy bitterness.
Creamy smooth mouthfeel, medium high level of carbonation, medium to thick body with a dry finish.
I enjoyed this one. Seems Ive been trying a few black lagers as of late and enjoying the trip as well. Smooth and roasty works for me every time.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"

Excellent coffee aroma with a little chocolate and sherrylike nutty notes. Opaque black with a light brown, thick ring on top. Potent toasty coffee malt with a black malt bitterness that plays off a grain flavour. Way more black malt character than the typical Schwarzbier, but not roasty/toasty like stout/porter. Interesting. Medium body, moderate carbonation, moderately bitter finish.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"
4360,"2011-05-27",4.3,"Picked up a case of this at the Rogue Garage Sale this morning - 

Black, big brown head.  The nose is smokey coffee with some burnt sugar sweetness but not too much, and some fluffy breadiness.  It is full of tobacco flavours in the mouth, earthy and rich.  There is some spiky carbonation which mellows to a milky smooth finish which drifts away leaving a hint of bitter malt and soy sauce residue on the tongue. It is a wonderful progression. Very refined and seemingly well thought out.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Alphadelic"

The beer is  Blacker than black with a steady tan head and lace.  Nose shows a lot of roasted malt balanced nicely with some sweeter caramel malts, some light cocoa and coffee notes.

4360,"2011-05-24",3.8,"SCHIUMA:
schiuma marrone marcato, media presenza, non finissima, buona durata
COLORE:
nero impenetrabile, pulita
INTENSITA / FINEZZA / AROMA
non intensissima, con profumi di malto torrefatto, bruciato ma non affumicato, qualche nota di contorno che ricordano il caffè, la liquirizia. Luppoli quasi assenti.
GUSTO / RETROGUSTO / PERSISTENZA
entra secca , con da subito sapori amarognoli dovuti al tostato e torrefatto. Si riconosce caffè, con leggeri riflessi di liquirizia.  Lamaro tende ad essere più marcato sul finire dove dentrano in gioco anche i luppoli, anche se meno del previsto.

CORPO / CARBONATAZIONE / CONSISTENZA
corpo medio,  però con una consistenza quasi oleosa al versare nel bicchiere. Ben carbonata.

Buona, non ce che dire. Al versarla nel bicchiere uno pensa subito ad una imperial stout o baltic porter ( che si siano sbagliati a scrivere in etichetta ""lager"" ?!), visto il colore di birra e schiuma e la consistenza visiva molto ""solida"". Poi in bocca si ritorna al mondo lager, senza quel classico apporto ale leggermente astringente, le note di caffe e liquirizia e cioccolato sono molto meno evidenti, lasciando spazio ad un torrefatto spinto, secco. Lamaro rimane contenuto, i luppoli non sono dominanti ma fanno da sostegno ai malti. Per concludere, una schwarzbier complessa, sostanziosa  e molto godibile.","(Madrid","molly75"

The tastes are smooth and malty, just the right amount of smoke bite.

4360,"2011-03-04",3.4,"Bomber, pretty fresh.  True to its name, the body is pretty much a dense, pitch black shade.  The head is initially thick and spongy, but collapses at a moderate pace to a thin, mocha colored layer with a ring at the edge.  Scant, skinny flares of lacing jut outward from the body, barely clinging to the glass.  The nose is distinctly lagerish, clearly showing bready German yeast tendencies beneath notes of darkly roasted, almost charred black patent malt, bittersweet cocoa, bakers chocolate, and faint licorice.  Coffee roast and earthen hops join the fold, perpetuating the generally bitter theme.  Flavors largely follow suit, biting aggressively into the tongue with robust, darkly roasted, nearly burnt coffee and cocoa malts.  Earth, toasted pumpernickel crust, and scorched molasses lend further sharp richness, while crackery baking yeast lightens things up a bit.  The palate is substantive and rather chalky, drinking with considerably more heft than its 5% ABV would suggest.  Carbonation is light but persistent, working with the yeast to effectively dry out what little sugars lie within.  Those sugars do leave a sticky substance behind, though.  Pretty decent brew.  Be prepared for a roast bomb, though.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

4360,"2011-02-03",4.3,"You guessed it - the beer poured a dark and solid black. The head was a few fingers thick and brown - similar to chocolate milk though not as smooth. Head retention was impressively long and ample lacing was deposited in icicles around the glass.

The aroma is of roasted malts up front with a sweetness in the finish. There are notes of chocolate, coffee and molasses in the nose.

The taste elaborates on the the aroma with a good and strong dark roasted malt flavor with some hints of burnt - but not in a bad way. This would be from the black malts which are used as coloring more than strictly flavor. In the middle of the taste you get some coffee, chocolate, and molasses as well. The beer finishes bitter with a wave of hops that balances the beer out beautifully and clears your palate for the next sip. There is a lingering finish that seems to be split between the bitter hops and roasted malts. 

Dirtoir is medium to full bodied and the carbonation is moderate. It drinks very smooth and doesnt taste like an ABV of 6.2%. 

I was extremely impressed with this beer because it delivered on the flavors I love in dark beer but kept the overall impression ""light"". This was not a ""meal in a glass"" as some would say but a light and refreshing black beer.

4360,"2011-01-29",4.1,"Opaque black. RIch mocha froth adorns the glass and exhibits superior retention. Stellar nose of scorched malt, wafer cookies, toffee, black licorice, coffee grounds, and a big whiff of minerals. Background notes of smoke, plum skin, deeply toasted biscuits and unsweetened dark chocolate. Soft, fine carbonation. An airy, snappily mineralic, and bracingly roasty onset is shadowed by a captivating burnt wood and ashen malt surge. Expertly extracted malt boasts immensely deep notes of toffee-drizzled nuts and dabs of toasted straw which beautify the sturdy char frame. An array of nuance and soft, dusty textures exude throughout. Further enriching the char is a lush palate-clasping pillar of bitter cocoa and tar-bathed espresso beans. Beneath the complex maltiness lurks absolutely dazzling interplay of unripe plums and black-malt acidity. The body is awash with minerals which latch onto the gritty char, cleansing the palate along the way and imparting obligatory lager zip. Finishes briskly yet with softening shades of smoke and bittersweet  chocolate. The steep $7 price tag is unfortunate, IMHO, as world-class lagers need to reach a broader audience.

4360,"2011-01-09",3.2,"650 ml bottle.  Pours a dark black with a nice dark red hue and a nice quarter inch dark brown head that fades quickly.

4360,"2010-12-01",4.1,"Pours black with a nice dark brown head and a very nice amount of lacing. Nose is very nice--plenty malty with a good amount of roast.

4360,"2010-08-19",3.4,"In short: A very roasted black beer with a strong coffee character.  Straightforward but good
How: Bottles, 22oz.  A few times.  This rating for a bottle (or two) consumed fresh a few months ago soon after the beer release.  Tasting session with Montreal crew.
The look: Black body topped by a tan ring of foam
In long: Nose is highly roasted with roasted coffee beans notes.  Taste is more of the same.  This is just a simple beer with plenty of highly roasted (almost burnt) dark malts that brings a good roasted coffee beans flavor.  A very light cacao powder sensation, a tiny bit of acidity.  As it is the case with most highly roasted beers, this one feels rather dry and not much sweetness it feels quite dry.  I would have never guessed that this is a lager/ Schwarzbier.  But the question remains.  What is a Dirtoir?  I googled it and found nothing.  Is it even a word?  It probably doesnt exist.  Maybe it is a building where we teach young chickens to dance ballet, since that probably does not exist either.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

4360,"2010-07-07",3.4,"Enjoyed from a 22oz bomber in a stemless wine goblet.  As expected, the beer pours a jet black color, with a moderate to large medium tan head.  The nose carries some subtle notes of grassy hops, straw-like malt notes, some dark chocolate notes, and some toasted malt scents.  The palate is carbonated like a kolsch or a pilsner, not off-style or unpleasant, but always a bit of a surprise from a beer with such a lofty SRM.  The flavors seem to resemble an American stout more than the moderately malty flavors of classic Teutonic examples of the style.  Roasted notes up front, a slight straw-like malt flavor, assertive bitterness and charactered hop flavors on the back end.  The finish leaves a lingering bitterness and roasted note in the mouth, but is otherwise clean.  Overall, not unpleasant or poorly conceived, but missing something in the German character malt department that, if traded with a little less bitterness, could elevate the beers enjoyability.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

This is not at all what I was expecting from a ""black lager"" but Im very pleasantly surprised. Aroma is heavy on the roasted malt and chocolate with a bit of smokiness. Pours deep black with a huge dark mocha head which was absolutely gorgeous for a few seconds. The head disappeared almost immediately and left no trace at all. Its possible that my glass was to blame but it doesnt feel like a lacer. Full bodied and smooth but very lightly carbonated. Smells, looks, and tastes big but isnt at all and somehow that leaves me wanting, though it shouldnt. Really a nice beer.","Austin, Texas, USA","exparte"
4360,"2010-06-27",3.8,"Bottle and served in my Duval snifter: Pours near jet black with a creamy head and moderate sticky lace, looks a lot like a Impy Stout in the glass.

The taste display a acidic but not really fruity twang, plenty of astrengent black patent malt and finishing hit of mocha powder. The hops display a nice countering bitterness but also seem a tad nondescript, not really PNW resiny nor classic noble character either. The finish is a tad chalky,ashy, and minerally which is to be expected once you know what is in the brew. The mouth feel is tight lively carbonation balanced by the addition heft of the melanoidin, slightly heavier and more aggressive than one normally finds in most Schwarzbiers. Reminds me somewhat of the ""Black IPA"" I homebrewed but with less bitterness, very similar mouth feel, malt and yeast profiles .

4360,"2010-05-13",3.9,"Served from 22 oz bottle into Ommegang Flute.  Pours as black as can be with a two finger tan head.  The aroma is comprised of malts and a slight hint of coffee.  The flavor of this brew has a nice malty flavor with subtle hints of coffee and with a slightly bitter aftertaste when swallowing.  This brew has a light feel on the palate with low carbonation.  There is minimal lacing throughout.  Overall this is a very nice low intensity flavor for a black lager.  It is easy to drink and very enjoyable.  This is a very nice brew by Rogue.

In the nose, theres a surface aroma of roasted malts with hints of ground coffee and sour milk. The flavor is a little sour and reminds me of a soy milk or half and half dairy, but there is a faint background of Folgers ground coffee and roast malt that really gives this is an extra kick compared to other black lagers( schwarzbier) being made in the states.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

I do like the color, but the result of that darkness is a bitter grainy beer.  Aroma is extremely earthy, and any hops are blunted by the thick earthy maltiness.

Holy crap thats exactly what I was going to say, word for word, honest!

Kidding aside. This is supposed to be a black lager? Makes me laugh even more at the what Heineken thinks of as a dark lager.

Awesome to look at. Black as midnight with the medium head just as dark. A true dark knight. Burnt bitterness enters the mouth....dominant  burnt char in mid-palate...a whiff of orange citrus near the end followed by bitter hops at the end. The finish tastes like burnt toast.

4360,"2010-04-12",4.1,"Poured out an ultra dark brown that is nothing short of totally black in my glass - slid out of the bottle like oil! Gave way to an inch thick dark brown slightly foamy cap that leaves behind randomness on my glass while retaining more than surface cover the entire time. Well.. half way through 650ml and I only got this far... sure am enjoying this. The aroma is keeping my nose very aware with its chocolatey goodness, ultra dark yet soft roasted malts, maybe earth, something that reminds me of the bottom of an old, dirty leather pouch (hahaha - that sure makes me sound like a teary eyed pillow biter...), hint of an autumn bouquet of flowers, faint citrus and fish. The taste is large, dirty and endless. Massive roast and not overly bitter dark chocolate dominate this beast, ashes, espresso (subdued and acceptable), tang of citrus that I cannot decipher due to the roasted beating my taste buds are receiving, nuts.. maybe almonds? me thinks that is correct. The fruitiness is coming around now but still beaten down... cant place the fruit.. its something red and fleshy with a bit of red apple skin maybe - hard to tell. Hell of a mix - I wonder how many pints I could drink before I could actually sweat the aroma out (kinda like a very long night of Vodka.. or an ungodly serving of garlic). Thick coating is excellent and keeps me coming back for more, placing my mouth in a big ole Lazy Boy, fully reclined. Full bodied, excellent bitterness. This is one big ass satisfying brew that never once let up in pleasing my senses and gave me breath that even my wife can be proud of... for once.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Looks like an ad for big fat mash bills while its there, though. Protein rich. Not much lace, though, nor head retention. Roasty, somewhat ashy and a bit smoky nose. Creamy medium body with soft carb, bordering on thick and viscous. Chewy and velvety for sure. Ashy, roasty mid-palate, a little bit of good coffee and maybe a bit of campfire in there. This is every bit as much a schwarzbier as I am an emperor penguin, but it doesnt matter a bit what Rogue or anyone else wants to call it. Its good stuff. At 5%, are you kidding me?

Finishes very dry from the roast along with a light, resiny bitterness. Lengthy aftertaste after a medium, very smooth body. Nicely carbonated too. Overall, a very cool schwarz.

Lots of sticky lacing. Aroma is full of dark roasty notes of dark chocolate, roasted almonds, and freshly brewed coffee. Creamy and coating, almost full bodied. The dark roasty notes also dominate the flavor profile. Coffee and bittersweet chocolate are present throughout. Spicy and earthy hop notes emerge in the middle.

4360,"2010-03-14",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Roasted malts and their coffee allusions delve into caramel and chocolate sweetness for a big and bold cousin to the Schwarzbier style.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the blackness.
-This is way too bulky for it to be a classic representation of a Schwarzbier, but I cannot say the mouthfeel is not pleasant.
-Some hop resins create bitterness alongside that of the roasted malts.
-Minty edges are also found in the finish.

4360,"2010-03-12",4.2,"I was a bit shocked when I started pouring this. I have been drinking a lot of WR stout from a party pig and this black lager reminds me of it a lot. Strong roasted black malts in aroma, quite sweet smelling, lots of coffee too but it isnt the predominant smell. Pours with a CRAZY INSANE head, its a good thing I have a giant glass for the bigger bottles (usually 750 mls) and this filled the whole cup to the top with head. Very tight bubbles, fantastic lacing, black, dark and BLACK! Flavour starts with the coffee and comes into the sweet malts. The malts linger a long time, but it is a fairly thinnish brew, you can just taste a bit of the 6.2% (I find it quite odd that they dont put that on the bottle themselves, I all-grain brew and dont know what all the info on there really refers too but ABV is quite usefull) As the beer goes down.... there is a more lingering alcohol taste. Its a bit high for the malt and hops to really cover up for the long run. A great black lager, just a bit too high % that you can taste and smell.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","TheHulk"

Very much the same notes in the flavor - deep chocolaty malts are accompanied the full way through by a pleasant earthy, smoky, coffee-like bitterness - not due to the hops, though, but definitely from all the specialty malts.The carbonation is strong, a little sharp, which helps to balance the heavier malt.

Thickest lager in general that I have ever seen.  The aroma is also similar to an imperial stout, but a bit frutier.  Very roasty--molasses and dark bitter chocolate--with a hint of hops and a bit of a smoke character.  The flavor is the same.  Very roasty and a bit smokey.  The normal fruit character I notice in other schwarz does seem very present. On the upper end of Medium bodied with small fine carbonation.  Overall: a very impressive beer, but it just seems like a stout or porter to me, not a schwarz.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"
4360,"2010-02-22",3.6,"(bottle - 22 oz) Dark black with a rocky tan head. Heavy smoke in the aroma. Some mild bitterness and roasted chocolate, but a lot of heavy smoke and meat notes. Smells like a rauchbier. Flavor definitely lends itself to that. Smoke and bacon in the front that melds into a rich and chocolaty middle with a mild hop aftertaste. The smoke notes linger for a while and leave a light touch of campfire smoke on your palate.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"
4360,"2010-02-22",3.9,"Bomber.  Pours a fizzy black with loads of carbonation rising up to a fizzy head that dies down before the glass moves from counter to table in the house.  Aromas are roasty, earthy and dark.  Rich topsoil after a rain, a little chocolate, some wood and wet leaves... nice.  Flavor is even better.  One of the better Rogue offerings in years.  Rich and heavy bitter chocolate surfaces at several points as the plot develops.  A burnt edge to it with a little bit of charcoal or something in there and a little bit of a creaminess that just peeks through at times.  Really decent stuff.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"
4360,"2010-02-22",3.6,"This poured a dark brown almost black color with a light tan head. Aroma was lightly toased malts, some chocolate and some freshly picked hops.

4360,"2010-02-22",3.4,"Sometimes you look at the scores of others on this site, and just sort of say ""huh?""  And that is my reaction in this particular case.  Schwarzbier is not necessarily the most dynamic of styles, but this particular example is full of flavor.  Im just not sure that all that flavor really belongs in a beer of this style and if I really like the flavor thats there.

It pours a pretty thick black - much more like Imperial Stout than Scharzbier.  Color is there, but viscosity is off.  Aroma was to me less roasty than it was smokey.  This was confirmed to me upon my first few sips, which were decidedly smokey and to my mind a bit on the earthy/peaty side.  Not light on the tongue like Sprecher Bavarian Black or Kostritzer, which I think of as sort of the American and international standards for the style.  The flavor was pungent and not unpleasant, but not really delicious nor appropriate IMO either.

Still, not a bad beer.  I bought 2 bottles of this at Blacklick Liquor in Columbus.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

4360,"2010-02-21",3.6,"Pours into my New Belgium Globe glass with almost four fingers of dark brown colored head; the head even leaves some lacing patternes on the side of my glass as it slowly subsides.  The beer is quite black in color, almost perfectly so and it is quite opaque when held up to the light.  The aroma is a richly roasted mix of deeply toasted whole grain notes, French Roast coffee, burnt grain and toasted, almost burnt crackers.  As the beer warms some dark chocolate notes become noticeable as does some burnt, caramelized malt character.  The aroma smells quite appetizing and really has a wholesome grain / bread quality to it.

This has a light acidity to it as I take my first sip.  The roast character definitely plays the dominant role here.  The finish has a dark roast coffee bitterness, some clean hop bitterness and a toasted grain huskiness that gives this a rustic grain quality.  There is a charred smokiness to this beer brought on by a charcoal like roasted character.  This beer is actually quite savory in character as the malt base is quite rich.  There is perhaps a hint of molasses flavor here from the sweet malt that is just barely noticeable under all of the roast character.  This hint of sweetness also brings out a dark cocoa flavor.  While rich and satisfying this is still a beer that I find easy to finish my 22oz bottle of.  It is a bit over-carbonated, which contributes a sharp carbonic acidity, but luckily this is easily gotten rid of.  There seems to be a hint of mint character here that is likely derived from a touch of herbal hop notes.

This is a deeply satisfying and rich Stout made with Lager yeast.  This is quite enjoyable and better than I was expecting.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Appearance: It looks black but up against the light you can see a slight red tint, a very nice amount of dark tan head and lots of lacing left in the glass 
Aroma: Roasted malts, coffee 
Taste: Smokey (malts), coffee, hops in the finish 
This is a very good beer, very drinkable.","Utah, USA","Sledutah"
4360,"2010-01-29",3.7,"Tasting - The Wine Source.  Thanks, Brian!  Earthed smoke and roasty cocoa aromas ride a soft yeasty undercurrent throughout.  Nice balance of earthed roasty choco-like tones over light swirls of salty smoke and cream.  Just a touch of hop bitterness in the finish rounds this off well.  Medium bodied with soft carboantion.  Not expecting much, but was certainly a nice suprise here.  I would re-visit this in a heartbeat...","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
4360,"2010-01-28",4.6,"650 ml. Opaque ebony with a lasting 1/4 inch of cream. Nose of cocoa, caramel, cappuccino and cream.  Drippy, sticky lace everywhere. Flavors of semi sweet chocolate, espresso, nutty caramel, and hints of salty hickory smoke. Medium-heavy body is well-balanced, smooth and creamy with just a little too much frothiness. Great brew, the lagering really smooths the rough edges of the roast very nicely.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
4360,"2010-01-28",4.1,"Bomber pours pitch black with a nice tan head.  Aroma of roasted malts, loads of dark roasted coffee, dark cocoa.  Smoky flavor with roasted coffee, balanced by muted dry hops.  Finishes mocha and quite rich for the abv.  Frothy mouthfeel with low-medium carbonation level and medium body.  Different, interesting brew, especially for a relatively low abv lager.  Very drinkable and sessionable.  Great stuff.","Idaho, USA","TLNash886"
4360,"2010-01-27",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2010 22 ounce bottle - $5.39 at Beverage SuperStore in Suwanee, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours out the ebony body one would expect crowned with a well-sized, substantial tan-colored head.

Smell: The aroma is absorbed in rich roasty, toasty scents and a full notes of espresso, dark chocolate, and charred nuts with lesser, lighter hints of earthy, piny hops.

Taste: Starts roasty with some sweetened coffee and bittersweet chocolate tastes with a touch of smokiness and eventually tones down to a well-toasted quality. Small amount of burnt almonds. A slight fruitiness transitions into a faint spicy, piney hop character with a modest amount of bitterness paired with the minor black malt astringency. Hint of German yeastiness in the background. Drying finish thats both roasty and bit bitter.

Mouthfeel: A skosh above medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Pleasantly smooth mouthfeel.

Drinkability: While I would say its a tad more bolder than a standard Schwarzbier, it is by no means overblown and is actually a very enjoyable beer (or at least I thought so). Go on, friends, give it a try!","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
4360,"2010-01-26",3.7,"22oz. Bottle:  Aroma of roasted and burnt malt, chocolate, slight bitter coffee, black bread, and a hint of smoke.

Tastes of burnt malt, roasted malt, light milk chocolate, slight bitter coffee, slight smoke, and a hint of cream.  Medium body.  Tingly, then lightly dry texture.  Average carbonation.

4360,"2010-01-25",3.8,"Bomber from Hop City. This is the darkest lager I have ever seen.  Its darker than even most Baltic porters Ive had. The body is nearly jet black and the head is basically brown. The aroma is super roasty, lots of espresso is noted with sharp hops which dont really stand out but rather provide balance. Im trying to believe this is a lager. Ive always said that you cant judge a beer by its appearance and this is reinforcing my opinion to the point where even I cant believe whats going on with this beer. A sip provides a lot of chocolate, almond, and coffee flavor. The palate is dense. The finish finally hints at some lager character, something I could associate with a schwarz. Its kind of like seaweed. I am highly impressed with this offering from Rogue. Its a departure from the norm and its a departure from what Rogue generally brews e.g. no Pac-Man yeast and no ridiculous hops character. Mad props.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

4360,"2010-01-24",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2010 22oz bottle, purchased at Petaluma Market. Pours a very dark chocolate color; significant, creamy medium-tan head with great retention and lacing that lasts; beautiful pour. Lots of roasted / lightly charred malts and bitter chocolate in the aroma; not a huge overt hop character here, but plenty of bitterness coming from the chocolate and char; very dry; quiet yeast character; mouthwatering, dry, and pleasantly bitter. Medium mouthfeel: lots of bitter chocolate and roasted maltiness here, with some pleasant citrus and mineral bitterness quietly balancing out the prominent malt core; nicely bitter, creamy texture in the mouth, highly sessionable; beautifully made; it just doesnt quite set my heart on fire hedonistically (a more charismatic yeast character would help); very tasty overall. Lasting finish of milk chocolate, roasted malts, and hints of vanilla; not nearly as roasted / bitter as the core; nicely balanced, moderately dry ending.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

There is a hint of earthiness and light notes of molasses sweetness.  The flavor starts bready with toast and coffee - a bit mildly flavored compared to the big aroma. A firm earthy bitterness enters at midpalate. Firm clean bitter finish with strong notes of coffee - very bitter. The mouthfeel is light-medium in body with soft and creamy carbonation and a subtle astringency in the back.

Nice toasty finish. Excellent offering from Rogue.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","patrickfannon"
4360,"2010-01-16",4.0,"Pours surprisingly dark, almost completely black actually, with no light passing through at all.  The head is enormous and frothy, dark beige in color and shows excellent staying power and lacing.

The aroma is big and complex for the style.  Its dominated by a heavily roasted black malt base but there are lots of hops in the nose as well, earthy and grassy.  The malts take on an almost espresso-like character as it warms.

The taste has an initial grassy hop character that is soon overwhelmed by the heavily roasted coffee and black malts.  The finish is dry and bitter, seemingly equal parts espresso and hops.

The mouthfeel is exceptionally creamy, but with tons of carbonation and dry and pleasantly bitter in the finish.  Its very roasty overall.

Well, this is one of the better Rogue beers Ive had in a long, long time, and one of the top few schwarzbiers Ive ever had.  Its complex and unique for the style with a hefty hop presence compared to other versions Ive had.  Very well crafted.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
