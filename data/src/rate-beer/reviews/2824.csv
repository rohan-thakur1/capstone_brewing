The flavor profile is world class. It is intense (hop flavor), somewhat complex and well balanced. It begins with Saaz hop flavor (not as pronounced as Urquel, unfortunately) that flows into a mild bitterness in the middle. As the bitterness asserts itself, a biscuit sweetness arrives to provide a tasty balance.

O- Ive heard good things about this and honestly, I didnt know why, its a pilsener. After trying, I can agree that its a decent beer and the added subtle hop notes are nice but its still nothing that excited me. Pretty standard, good for its style I guess, but not that great of a beer.","Ravenna, Nebraska, USA","HuskerTan"

2824,"2015-01-08",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2015 brown bottle poured into a pilsner glass
a: Clear golden yellow with fine light to average carbonation. A gentle pour yields a finger of white head that dissipates after about 5 minutes leaving a decent amount of lacing which holds nicely to the glass. Pools of foam also tend to remain on the surface of the beer.

s: Nothing sticks out. A little biscuit balanced by a subtle floral hop aroma.

t: Again, well balanced with a slight but noticeable hop bite. Smooth maltiness provides a hint of chewiness to the beer. Hops on the finish which is appealing as it lingers however Im not getting floral as in the nose. Not nearly as hoppy as some have opined and definitely not citrusy. Maybe slightly more piny or herbal.

m: Very light body with the bubbles providing a slight tingle. Doesnt look like much but I kind of like it. I think this works nicely against the malt too, tying the flavor profile together. I would like a bit more more carbonation in this beer.

o: Have to say Im a bit disappointed with Prima especially after reading that it is among the absolute best in the style. Very nice of course but doesnt really impress me in any way. Certainly nothing bad to report but while interesting, also a little underwhelming though I wouldl buy it again.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","malvrich"

2824,"2014-08-08",3.7,"Transfer from BA review on 10-6-12- 
 Poured from bottle into pint glass

 Appearance  Pours a golden colored brew with huge white head. The head has great retention, eventually fading to give a lighter level of lacing.

 Smell  The smell is a mix of a grainy and a light grapefruit citrus. Beyond that there is a small amount of a pine hop smell.

 Taste  The taste starts out of a malty grain flavor with some light sweetness. As the taste advances, some lemon and a grapefruit hop flavor come to the tongue. These two tastes (grapefruit and lemon) intensify as the taste moves on, although they never get too strong. In the end the hop, combined with the wheat and a newly arriving bitter earthy and grassy hop flavor, create a dry, bitter, wheat flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer was on light to medium side with a carbonation level that was on the average side. Both were quite nice as they suited the dry flavors and transitions well as well as made for a very drinkable brew.

 Overall  A nice refreshing, bitter beer.","","Darkmagus82"

Fresh with a great blend of citrus and grassy hops & light pilsner malts. Theres a hint of sweetness& floral notes and overall the beer is light and refreshing without coming across as weak or bland.

2824,"2014-04-26",3.7,"12oz bottle poured into a pilsener glass. While the head is abundant, a bready, biscuity, toast aroma emanates.

The beer is a beautiful, clear, effervescent, sparkling straw gold color with a white, gelatin-like head consisting of small and micro bubbles. The head retains well with a nice puffy, creamy coverage atop the beer, and it leaves an ample, messy webbing lace. Its a prominently bitter beer, medium / medium-high levels, with a light sweetness to support it. The medium-full body has an active, yet soft carbonation in above-average quantity. Its a light, grainy texture that dry, crisp, and refreshing. The mouthfeel is primarily toasty and peppery which carries to the finish.

2824,"2013-09-09",3.7,"Best by October 9th 2013... since thats five months away, my assumption is that this beer is probably very fresh.

Appearance: It looks like any other pilsener would -- a crystal clear yellow color. As many would affectionately refer to it as, it looks like piss. Not much lacing small white ring on top. Looks pretty ordinary.

Smell: A lot of hay, and also grain. As theres a big hop on the logo of this beer, I was expecting a pretty nice hop presence, and there *is* one. Its not so big that it morphs this into some sort of pilsener/IPA hybrid, but its more than welcome -- especially in the taste.

Taste: Yeah, probably the best pilsener Ive had. It has that typical flavor youd expect from a pilsener, but the hops lift it up a little bit. This is the most bitter beer Ive had from the style, but its not extreme, which I wouldnt expect. The amount of hops here compliment everything nicely. This is definitely a pilsener for hopheads. The mouthfeel is relatively thin, but has a nice body, given the style. A very good choice for a summer beer.

Prima Pils is an enjoyable German-style pilsner with a solid continental hop presence in both bitterness and flavor, which still lets some of the German pilsner malts to peek through as well. Easily drinkable for those who enjoy a bit more hop presence in their pilsners, this is an easy-go to for any time of the year.

Pours a brilliantly white-colored head, composed of small-sized bubbles that are packed densely together, giving a very frothy appearance. Retention is slightly above average, lasting about 1.5 minutes, fading to a thin cap of lace atop the body of the beer. Lacing is fairly good, consisting of small patterns and webs clinging to about a third of the glass interior. The beers body is a hazy (25-40% opaque) golden-orange color, light changing the hue to a bright, though pale, golden-yellow color. Carbonation is visible rising from the depths of the glass, sparse in number, but fairly quick to rise.

Aroma of notable continental hops right away, lending modest lemon, herbal and floral qualities, while the pilsner malt is not discounted either: the graininess and malty sweetness readily detectable in the background (perhaps a bit easier here since the bottle is nearly a month after its best-by date).

Front of palate finds pleasantly grainy and fresh pilsner malt flavors with a bit of light caramelized sugar sweetness (from Maillard reactions during the boil?) and hints of floral and lemon-like hops. Mid-palate of notable continental hop bitterness with attendant flavors of light lemon citrus, floral hoppiness with a slightly woodsy and herbal presence, and an underlying presence of grainy, slightly hot cereal-like pilsner malt that also contributes enough counterbalancing sweetness to make this work. Back of palate finds continued strong, clean (sharp? clear?) continental hop bitterness with undertones of herbal and light lemon citrus hop flavors and grainy pilsner malt. Aftertaste is of substantial hop bitterness, with herbal and floral qualities not far behind, along with hints of citric tartness and residual, slightly caramelized sugar sweetness from the malts.

Beer is of medium weight, with low to medium-low levels of carbonation, leading to a beer that softly, gradually foams up on the palate, then quickly settles to a smooth and slightly placid existence as it moves across the tongue. Never watery, but a bit more carbonation would suit this beer nicely. Closes very dry, with light stickiness remaining on the palate.","Wyoming, USA","tibicinoid"

A: Pours a golden straw color with an impressive luster to it. The head is a three finger white color with average retention. Eventually, the head settles to one finger with nice patches of lacing left on the glass.

S: Very zesty and grassy from the hops, with just a touch of citrus and earth. The hops take center stage over the pils malt backbone.

T: Plain and simple, this is a pilsner that thinks its an IPA. Lots of hop flavor and bitterness abound. Grass and earth are the initial flavors, before giving way to black pepper, grapefruit rind, lemon zest, and pine notes on the finish and aftertaste. Theres even a modicum of hop-driven complexity - a bit more than the average IPA, in fact. This is one of the more flavorful pilsners Ive had, with the malt backbone helping to keep the surprising hop profile in check...but only just.

The aroma is of lager malt, a slight funk (positive), floral notes / floral hops.

The flavor is quite tasty and refreshing. This is one of the better examples of a German Pilsener I have had, especially from an American brewery. The flavor leads with a malty, biscuity character, then gracefully transitions to a light hop bitterness in the finish. Personally, I would prefer the hop character to be slightly less pronounced, allowing the malt component to shine through a bit more, but I cant deny that this is done artfully.

Easy to drink, a bold flavor, distinctive. This is in the upper echelon of the style, without question.

2824,"2012-07-28",4.7,"Bottle, poured into a tulip tasting glass.  Big pour leads to two fingers sticky white head.  Beer is a beautiful golden straw.  Retention is high, as is lacing.  Crackery nose with spicy hop presence.  Herbal and floral, with notes of lime and a touch of sulfur.  Tastes surprisingly bitter for a pils.  Over the top noble hop presence leads to the same leafy/floral notes, along with a high degree of minerality and a bit of soapy bitterness.  Bright and lively carbonation keeps things light and refreshing, especially when paired with the dry aftertaste.  This is simply one of the best lagers I have ever tasted.

Wish aroma was as strong as the taste. Taste is floral hops. Also taste some lemony sweetness in the beginning but all the sweetness only lasts for a brief second before getting hit with the bold hops flavor. Full bodies. Light carbonation. Strong bitterness towards the middle and end. Crisp but not too fast on the finish. My rating is kind of low only because strong hops flavor isn't my preference.

Body is light with a thin texture, carbonation is lively.  Moderately abrupt, bitter finish.

2824,"2012-03-15",4.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/18/2011.  ""Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

Prima Pils has a light golden straw color, more pale than vibrant. A medium-sized off-white head foams up on top before fading to a ring around the size of the glass.

The aroma has a slightly skunky hop aroma with a serious citrus edge. Light pilsener malt has just a hint of sweetness. Spicy, earthy hops and a bit of fresh cut grass add even more depth to the hoppy aroma.

This flavor impresses me at first and only gets better as I am able to analyze it more closely with each sip. The malt is quite dry, with just a hint of honey sweetness. A grassy bitterness starts to take hold. As the hops become more noticeable, a mostly earthy flavor comes through with a bit of spice on the tip of the tongue. The finish is firmly bitter with more grass and a bit of ammonia skunk.

At first I notice how grainy the front end is, along with how dry the mouthfeel is. The body feels a bit fuller than the average pilsener, but not by much. The carbonation is crisp but a little bit on the light side. There is a light residual hop oil after each sip. 

I was definitely surprised that I liked this as much as I did. It seems to be one of the best pilseners I have had. The combination of grainy pilsener malt, grassy and earthy hops, and yeast create a special beer that I will definitely be going back to.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

2824,"2011-11-22",4.1,"Not quite bright on the pour, it sits quietly with just a sprinkling of fine carbonation dancing in uniform streams up to a tight, compact white crest atop. The head lasts the distance, a fine lace left in its wake. The body a misted orange gold. Soft zest of lemon and lime comes through on the nose under some clean, dusty grain, chaff and toothpick, and bright Saaz hops, very nice. Saaz hop dominated palate. Rough and mostly dry in back, very peppery and herbaceous. It peaks on the swallow and drops off with great haste, a bitter edge that grips the mouth well. The body is light but I would call it anything but delicate. Its got a reserved citrus fruit sweetness that adds a degree of tang to it, the malt profile being dry, dusty and just a little gritty. Impeccably balanced with little inklings of nuances that keep it interesting. Lightly floral, raspy, piney, the carbonation just enough to give it bounce. I love this beer.

2824,"2011-07-11",1.5,"Overcompensation is a distinctly American problem at this point in brewing.  This does not taste like pilsener.  Underneath the outrageous amount of hops, you can taste something like a pilsener, but its hard.  This is the last time I go to the liquor store looking for something, and allow the people on staff to talk me into buying an American Craft Beer, because after decades of corporate swill which had almost no hops, American Craft brewers just cant bring themselves to brew a beer the way its meant to taste.  The way European breweries have brewed beers for centuries:  with a REASONABLE, and BALANCED amount of hops.  Its a shame, because you can tell that the beer, like many American Craft beers, is manufactured with an overall quality.  Dont get me wrong, theres a time and a place for a hop bomb.  Its called Pale Ale, and when I say this, I dont mean that EVERY pale ale should be a hop bomb... I mean that certain ones should as a change of pace.  Of course, most people wont even think this is a hop bomb, because any shred of nuance in the palate for most craft beer drinkers has been blasted away with a steady stream alpha acids, til the brain of the drinker learns to filter them out of his reality as a matter of course, and then more and more are needed to get the same effect.  Of course, you might say ""but, if people like all these hops in a beer, then whats the problem?""  The problem is that once you dump a ton of hops into a stout, a hefeweizen, or a pilsener, is that they cease to be traditional stouts, hefeweizens and pilseners.  They then become something else.  You might call them ""ultra hoppy stouts, hefeweizens and pilseners"", but traditional brews they are not, and theyre beginning to taste all the same.  So, until the Craft Brewers of the USA start to gain some sense of equilibrium, Im basically finished trying new products of theirs, unless I have a reason to think its actually going to taste any different, and on the rare occasion that I actually want a hop bomb, Ill reach for a Three Floyds Alpha King because its one of the finest brews made, and it doesnt claim to be something its not.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","FastEddie"

2824,"2011-05-27",3.9,"12 oz. bottle- Pours hazy (interesting) pale golden with a thin soapy white head and nice lacework, aroma is clean fresh hops, which is interesting because this beer is not fresh, it is past its expiration date by about two and a half months, I also get  citrusy lemon and fresh cut grass, nice beer so far. The taste is mellow yet has a hop bite, there is lemon and is  very dry, decent. The body is medium, finish is long and bitter, carbonation is high.

Quite an easy drinking Pilsner, for sure, one of the most solid American offerings of the style.  The Saaz hops show off their usual herbal, bitter funky finish, yet the lovely pale malts provide a tasty counter to the seriously German fade.  Absolutely gorgeous as beers go, with a shining, bright, clear golden color, an unending head, and lacing galore.

This raised a thick head out of the bottle despite an average pour, though this quickly dissipated to a ring of foam with lacing. A pale straw color, this fizzed nicely as I drank it, and went down like water - as a pilsener should do.

4.0 A: A tiny bit hazy. Straw colored. Very nice head retention and steady stream of bubbles from bottle of glass. Leaves plenty of lacing.

4.0 S: Hoppy for the style. Grassy and herbal hops. Balanced well with sweet and spicy malt character.

4.0 T: Hops manifest themselves in the taste as much as they do the nose. Quite bitter for a Pils. Earthy first, then spicy. Hopheads will love this. Though I love hoppy beers, I really dont want my Pilsners to be this bitter. Still, it is done really well if you accept that its out of the ordinary.

4.0 D: Not a boring Pilsner in the least. This Pils thinks its an IPA. This should keep you happy for a while.

2824,"2011-01-09",3.3,"12 oz. bottle. Pours a clear gold color with a small foamy white head and nice lacing. The aroma is apples, citrus hops and light wheat. The flavor is very bitter, but backed with a nice malt sweetness. The palate is light to medium with light carbonation. It is crisp and refreshing. Overall, a simple and excellent beer.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"
2824,"2011-01-08",3.9,"cant believe i havent rated this yet, grabbed a single from valley wines and spirits cause i havent had this in awhile. as michael jackson said in 500 classic brews, there is a reason that this has a hop cone on the label, this has to be one of the hoppiest pilsners ive had and it really works for this beer, golden color, pilsner aroma, and good malt/hop balance but way more hops than usual. would love to give this to every miller fan out there and say, ""this is what a pilsner should taste like"".","Cloneen, IRELAND","beerfest5"
2824,"2011-01-07",3.7,"Bottle.  Light golden pour with a 1-2 finger white head.  Very effervescent. Subtly sweet malt in the nose with predominant Euro hop oils.  Very flavorful pils with lots of bitter hops.  Light cereal malt shines through briefly mid palate.  Big mouthfeel for the style.  Not my preferred style of beer but this is quite tasty.","Whalezbro, Illinois, USA","HighWine"
2824,"2011-01-07",1.9,"Appearance: Poured a nice golden color with a little haziness. Thin white head that dissipated pretty quick. 

Aroma: Had a bit of an odd smell. Some hay and some citrus from the hops, but something else that I cant quite identify, but seemed off.

Taste: Not too bad at first, a bit of hoppiness, but left a bit of an aftertaste. 

Feel: Light to medium body and a little flat.

Overall: Served from a bottle. Best by date well past and probably contributed to a lower quality. I expect more from Victory Brewing. Ive always enjoyed their beers and needless to say, I was a bit disappointed that I had picked up a beer with an ""Enjoy By"" date from a little over a month ago. Will definitely have to try this again.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","jmshulk"

2824,"2010-12-31",4.3,"Pours a clear golden yellow, with one finger of foamy white head. Lots of bubbles flowing through the glass for as long as theres beer in it. Smell is somewhat faint; earthy and of grassy hops. Taste is similar but much more clear; a very smooth flavor with a crisp finish of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is very thin, with medium carbonation. All around an excellent beer, and one I wouldnt mind drinking regularly.","Canton, Ohio, USA","AwYeh"

Bad ass in a refined and laid back way. This beer is ’the dude’ from Big Lebowski in a more gentlemanly form. Great price too (6 pack was $10). Even the artwork is bad ass.","JAPAN","jonno"
2824,"2010-12-28",3.1,"bottle from bierzwerg!
In my glass pours in fact a beer that could be a German Pils. Strong golden yellow and a half high, fine-pored head. The smell is hoppy bitter, as usual, by a Pils. Starts strong bitter, little recent. The beginning section tastes as bitter as north-german beers like Jever or Flensburger. Although the center part is a bit milder, its a quite bitter-herb floral beer! Succeeded!","Merzkirchen, RLP, GERMANY","Grima"
2824,"2010-12-25",4.0,"Bottle.  Pours with a nice finger and a half of pure white really frothy head on a light, bright clear golden yellow that leans away from gold.  Savory and earthy hop notes, very classic Pils in the aroma...crackery dryness, and almost like a mineral hop.  Very lean, dry hoppiness in the flavor as well, savory, minerals, and a dry herbal finish.  Lightish body, no sweetness, and vibrant carbonation.  Exactly what I want from a Pils and one of my all-time favorite session brews.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"

2824,"2010-12-20",3.5,"Rich golden pour with pillows of white foam. Aroma is ctirus and pine hops, pale and doughy malts. Taste is bready, and for some reason makes me think of a pizza oven. Nice hop kick. Fairly bitter, but it is smooth and does not stick to your palate for long. Spritely carbonation that makes for easy drinking. Im not a big pils fan, but this is a nice drinkable brew that pairs well with most foods.","Ambler, Pennsylvania, USA","Steeeve"

Flavors are quite impressive and were different from my expectations. The hops are bigger than I would have dreamed and there seems to be a juicy citrus note as well. Soapiness comes across very mildly, and there is also a cereal grain element as well. It finishes slightly earthy, bitter, just excellent","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

2824,"2010-11-23",2.0,"Not a traditional Pilsner. Thats what the label should read. Drank from a bottle. Maybe I got a bad 6 pack. The aroma was citrus. The palate starts off light fruity malt but ends with pretty strong hoppy bitterness. More like an IPA with that assertive hop finish. Not a bad beer, but just not a pils in my opinion. I feel like the way this beer was described on the packaging was misleading.","New York, USA","FrankLe"
2824,"2010-11-05",4.8,"This is absolutely one of my favorite beers. Well done Victory! The color is golden with a touch of haze with a thick white head. The nose is slightly floral with some grass.

2824,"2010-10-30",2.9,"I am not a pilsner guy, so I apologize for the downgrade of a pretty solid beer.

Beer pours clear, medium gold colored with a small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing head. 

The aroma is surprisingly malty with moderate notes of slightly husky toasted grain, toasted bread; Hoppy with moderate notes of resin/pine.

The flavor is lightly sweet, moderate bitterness that grows heavy, finish is shorterlightly bitter, lightly acidic. Nets out a touch watery. The body is light, the texture is watery and the carbonation is lively.","Reading, Massachusetts, USA","jeckenroth"
2824,"2010-10-25",1.8,"UPDATED: JUN 11, 2011 Lucent gold, thin white head, watery medium body, crisp medium-high carbonation.

Aroma: fresh fruity orange floral hops, sweet pale malt, and a hint of alcohol.

Taste: hop bitterness, sweet pale malt, citrusy floral late hops, and a hint of vinous noble hops in the finish.

Good, but not really what i typically think of as pilsner, mostly due to the assertive bitterness and aromatic fruitiness of the hops. More like APA wort fermented cold with german lager yeast. Lack of malt backbone makes this non-sessional for me.","Sanford, Florida, USA","SanfordBrewer"

2824,"2010-10-22",3.8,"Pours clear bright gold with short lived white head. The modest aroma seems to be dominated by spicy hops with thin layers of floral hops and faint sweetness around the edges. The taste is up front bitter noble hops creating a mostly spicy profile with lesser amounts of floral and shrubbery like earthiness. Flavor hops grow to midway aided by faint sugary malt sweetness. It ends with a return of hop bitterness heading into the finish and after taste. Reminds me of a more bitter version of Sam Adams Boston Lager back in the early 90s with my early 90s palate.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
2824,"2010-10-20",2.6,"A well done pilsner, rated by someone who isnt big on pilsners.  Pours yellow with a nice head.  Not much aroma wise.  Has that bitter pilsner taste with more fresh hops than usual.  Very drinkable.  Its good but not great to me.  To a pilsner lover this is probably top notch.","Illinois, USA","edwardbass"
2824,"2010-10-16",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2010 Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Collins glass. Enjoy by Jan 20, 2011 printed on label.

Appearance: Pours a clear light gold with a 1 finger foamy white head. Decent lacing.

Smell: Floral hops with a hint of spice and lemon zest.

Taste: Sweet florals up front then a subdued mix of bready malt and spices in the middle ending with bitter lemon rind at the finish. The hops really coat the mouth in a good way. Aftertaste is quite bitter.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of prickly carbonation.

Drinkability: High drinkability. Goes down very smooth so you could drink several of these without any trouble.

Overall: Very good beer overall. I would definitely recommend checking this one out.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"

2824,"2010-10-12",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2013 Draft pint at The Lackman.  Its about time I finally got around to trying Prima Pils, the legendary pilsner.  Pours a clear gold color with finger-thick white head.  Good-looking, if not out of the ordinary for a pils.  Aroma of pilsner malts, grassy and floral hops, a little lemon and orange citrus, and straw.  The flavor follows suit closely; nothing complicated, but very nice.  Light-bodied, with crisp carbonation and a usual pils mouthfeel.  Good pils. Re-Rate: Loineshawns wedding- this was one of his two kegs. A lot more bitterness than I remember.

2824,"2010-09-23",3.2,"Pours light golden in color with a small, white head of very tight bubbles.  It is grassy in the nose with a sourness that winks at you before it goes slightly sweet.  Flavor is similar to the aroma - grass and straw circle the tongue with a sharpness from the hops giving a bitter start.  It mellows and fades into a malty middle but leaves a bitter finish long after the swallow.  It is tight and crisp in the mouth.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","Harsebrau"

The aroma shows notes of fresh grassy and citrus hops on top of a clean malt base of toasted bread and yeast. The flavors follow suit with the fresh grassy hops lending nice bitterness, while lemons add fresh citrus to the light toasted bread malts. Everything is balanced nicely.

Not a huge fan of the style, but I can enjoy this easily.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Nena"

The hop is definitely more present in the taste, and makes this quite a refreshing hoppy pils beer. I did not taste the hop as much drank from the bottle.

2824,"2010-04-22",5.0,"Aroma: This is in fact a pilsner, weird cause it smells like an amazing IPA! Huge citrus hops on the nose, like a bouquet of freshly picked backyard hops thrown into one of those fizzy yellow beers were all supposed to dislike. Very impressive!
Appearance: A nice pale straw to golden color with tons of CO2 bubbles fighting their way up the glass to escape. The head is maintaining a sturdy two finger height despite my best efforts to restrain it to fit in my favorite pils glass. A very nice champagne looking pils.
Taste: Wow hops! This beer should be its own style IPP because I dont know if you can have this much hop character, at least the huge fruity hop kind, in a pils. After the blast of hop flavor a very pleasant malt accent comes through lending a bit of rich and delicately sweet flavor to balance all those alpha acids. Then the beer hops your face off again.
Palate: Light and spritzy on the palate due to the great acidity and carbonation. This lager is very light in body and left my mouth very refreshed and yearning for another sip.
Overall: The best pils Ive ever had, ever. This beer has so much character and flavor it could be overwhelming to find it in a pils but the balance of flavors comes together to create on extremely hoppy and satisfying lager!","USA","Bludwig"

Bitter German malt flavor is actually delicious. Combines bitterness with a sweet, flowery malt as well. Some nice wheat, even a hint of berry. Hops are light, but they are there. Really rich compared to most pilsners.

I would give this a higher rating but there was something in the finish I didnt love.   Maybe a thin bitterness or sourness that wasnt part of the hop profile?  Older hops?  Pelletized hops?

The head is quite impressive, and the color is exactly what youd expect from a Pils; I dont really know what a 2 score for appearance would be, and Im trying to be fair to the style on the score.  Taste has the somewhat spicy note of the Saaz that you usually see in Pilsners, but its a bit more aggressive and has nice lemon zest finish.

Some soured elements as well. Upfront bitter. Hops fill out the middle with a rough finish. Dry to the bone. Rough finish. 1.5
RE-RATE 4/18/11 Bottle from World Market.  Pours a very clear golden yellow color with lots of carbonation bubbles apparent. The head is formed after a bit of agitation and forms into a foamy white crest.

The aroma is dry and malty, with a strong element of grains and a hint of citric fruit. Fairly straightforward by style standards. Smells very dry.

Flavor is dry to be certain, with grainy flavors, bitter malts with a hint of fruit with a dry and bitter grainy finish. Hops are felt and tasted as well and appear as a sharp bittering agent. As far as the style goes, this is very representative of what it should be. Its just honestly not one of my favorite styles, but I cant knock em for that!","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"

The aroma is amazing, German Pils malts topped with huge amounts of aromatic hops, Saaz, Noble, and maybe a hint of an American variety. Nice! Flavour does not let down. Great Pils malt body upfront met perfectly with descending hop notes, prickly and delicious. Incredibly well put together and the flavour progression is perfect.

2824,"2009-08-04",2.5,"(Bottle) I was disappointed with this one.  This beer tasted a lot more to me like a poorly executed Pale Ale than a Pilsner...there was none of the grassy quality that good Czech pilsners have, and none of that clean, crispness that both German and Czech varities exhibit.  Hoppier than typical for a Pils, and the malt is too heavy.  Listiglovers below remarked ""Seems like the bitterness of an IPA without the strong flavour, instead the flavour of a Pilsner.""--I think he hit the nail on the head here.  I think they need to work on this one if they want to really fit the style authentically--and also if they want to produce a truly quality brew.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","cazort"

Golden color wih a nice head and a good hoppy aroma. Flavor was hoppy and very crisp with a soft malt backing which became more noticable when it warmed. Fuller bodied than other Pilsners Ive had. Ill bet this would score pretty high if it were put up against any Czech or German Pilsner. Very solid beer, but its just not my favorite style.","SWITZERLAND","brewslurp"

I can smell the saaz from three feet away! This is one damn pungent pilsner. As I move the glass up to my nose the hop character kind of shifts to one of a much fruiter nature, the fresh hay is very strong on this one, but Im not getting the honey I usually get from a great pils, not that it has to be there, its cool to have something that smells this good but is distinctly different from other beers of this nature. The flavor is nicely bitter with a good lemony citrus character! Plenty of that almost bracingly bitter saaz hop character is all over this one too, and it makes for a really good aftertaste, not something I usually take note of in a beer, but this one finishes particularly strong. There is some good malt flavor for balance here too, its really very minimally grainy but has a very nice honey flavor that rounds this one out remarkably. Wonderfully clean, very easy to drink, Ive almost finished the bottle sitting here typing this, Im generally finished with my rating well before the bottle is half gone, I really want to drink a lot of this!","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Appearance: The body has a bright golden yellow color with plenty of sparkling carbonation and great clarity. The head is a wonderful thick and creamy topping with good retention. It also makes great lace rings on the glass as I drink.

Smell: The aroma hits you in the nose with spicy floral and grassy hops over pale malt.

Taste/Mouth: Its flavor is a crisp clean mix of its aroma. Hop flavor steals the show with bold spicy floral and grassy botanical notes. Underneath there is a pale crisp malt base that finishes dry with some nice clean hop bitterness. The palate is light to medium bodied with an easy drinking light wet texture. Carbonation is very active and helps to clean the palate.

Notes: This is a great example an American craft beer take on a classic Pilsener. The hops are bolder than there Euro counterparts.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

The difference is in the aroma, though.  As the head settles into a medium-heavy collar, an aroma like that of no other fizzy pale lager arises from the glass.  Wait, that smells like hops!  It IS hops, an abundance of em!!  Citrusy (lemon) hops to be exact.  Saaz?  I think so.  Ist sip has an initial hint of malt sweetness followed by those citrusy, slightly metallic hops.  Its a bold, powerful flavor that gets more intense on the swallow & lasts long after.  There is active carbonation on the tongue and a medium-light, crisp finish.

While it is not hard to drink, it is not as smooth as other craft pilsners out there.  Odd for the style, it seems to have a flavor on the finish that reminds me very much of a Hogaarden or any number of other Belgian witbiers.  It may be the touch of citrus, but it seems to also have some of the yeasty properties in a Belgian.  It also has a less crisp texture than what I imagine a pilsner to have.  It has an almost creamy mouthfeel.  Its carbonation lends to the creamy feel.   Overall, I do not think that this is a great beer.

This is probably the best American Pilsner syle beer Ive had. I also believe this is much better than Pilser Urquell, Czechvar, and Sam Adams lager.

Strong earthy, spicy hops, and distinct bread crust in the aroma.   The hops dominate the flavor profile, with a very light honey sweetness and bread flavor from the malt.   Finishes dry and bitter with plenty of earthy, spicy hops.   Light bodied with carbonation on the loose side.   Seems in the german vein, with the lean malt and bitterness, and I tend to like that style of pilsener a bit less than the more balanced czech style; regardless, this had great hopping and would be a prima go-to beer in warm weather.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Aroma of soft pilsner malt, a bit of dough/breadiness, a hint of honey, and some leafy, earthy hoppiness.  Crisp, smooth entry that leads into a soft biscuit-like flavor that transitions into an earthy hoppiness with some undertones of cracker and honey on the finish.

2824,"2008-11-20",4.1,"Ever since the original and classic pilsner was created, all pilsners to this day and far into the future will more than likely measure their worth by the original standard. Having a universally accepted and long-standing standard can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the validity of said standard. Thankfully, in the case of the traditional Czech pilsner, this is a fine contribution to brewing history which has persisted to this day. Once you go Czech, you quite literally can never go back. Stepping up to bat today is the Prima Pils from Victory Brewing, and as I saddle up to the plate, I wonder if this shall be a homerun or a foul-ball in the discriminatory game of Pilsner.

A gorgeous pale straw with a hint of soft white when held up to the light. Her light golden depths are held at bay by a luscious thick head; much like a cloud she rests on top of my Prima Pils, inviting me to disturb her puffy white purity. Delving into her inviting depths, a scattering of lace decorates the sides as a sweet and crisp nose of freshly cut grass, lemon rinds, and crisp pears fill my senses. Immediately I am struck by how bright and effervescent her body is. I close my eyes and imagine myself at a small bar on the cobblestone streets of Plzen, Czech, people-watching and savoring my freshly drawn pilsner. Lemon, sweet cut grass, pears, and even a note of crisp autumn apples seduce my palate. Some white grapefruit in her finish with hints of a spice I cannot quite put my finger on. Where are the malts in all of this? Lingering in the background, maintaining the balance while creating a beautiful harmony between fresh grassy and citric hops and soft chewy biscuity malts. Perfection.

If I hadnt known beforehand, someone could have easily poured me a glass of the Prima Pils from Victory Brewing and I would have thought it a fresh Czech import. From their beer glass to my beer glass, as fresh and deliciously traditional as possible. Victory Brewing got their Prima Pils dead-for-sights and in doing so continue to honor the classic Pilsner tradition started so many years ago.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

2824,"2008-08-27",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2011 Updated to reflect my mature palates appreciation for pils....everyone should be forced to re-rate this beer after 3,000+ reviews.   The pour gives a lightly hazy, glowing, golden-straw body with a moderate head of smooth eggshell foam.  Fading at a decent clip, the head settles as a swirly film with a tight, bubbled edge.  Tall striped flares of lacing slowly break apart into small, hard spots.  The nose is pils in its purest and most divine form.  Fresh grassy hops burst from the glass, biting with subtle hints of white pepper and drier notes of straw and earth.  Hops are perfectly balanced by notes of subtly sweet dough and bready lager yeast, taking a nod at farm-fresh egg yolk and baking bread.  Awesome.  It simply begs for a gulp.  There I go......GULP....GULP.  So damn refreshing.  The hops dig in to the tongue, reminding of fresh cut grass and peppery lemon rind.  Beneath, Bohemian malts are soft, round, and super-yeasty.  Everythings fresh and balanced, each sip begging the next....and the palate backs that all up.  Well carbonated, semi-dry, and fairly crisp, the body distributes the flavors throughout every square millimeter of the mouth, leaving a lingering grass bitterness that almost never fades.  THIS.  IS.  PILSNER.  My newfound go-to beer of choice.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

I agree with some of the previous reviewers that this beer probably isnt representative of the style.  I am rating this beer in a general case.  I would classify more as some kind of Pale.

2824,"2008-08-08",1.2,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2013 First of all, let me say that Pilsener is my favorite style of beer.  And that I have worked in 4 German Pils breweries.  This is not a Pils, has nothing to do with Pils.  It is an aggressively hopped American microbrew that tastes like a West Coast IPA.  The hop nose is overpowering, the extreme hop oil flavor does not belong here.  I do like the bitterness, but I get very little malt sweetness in the aftertaste.  Just another over the top, sledgehammer beer from amateurs who have not yet learned how to brew a sophisticated Pilsener.  ""Prima"" it is not.","Sacramento, California, USA","felsenpils"

Light to medium bodied on the palate  more body than I expected from the style.  Crisp.  Overall:  one of the better pilsners I have had, but Clipper Citys Uber Pilsner is way better.

Nice body; surprisingly full for such a light beer.

Probably not their fault, but theres very little left here in the way of hop aroma. Medium/light watery body, lots of artichokes and skunk on the mid-palate.

sensory first impression: No head but a beautiful yellow golden beer. A pilsner, to be sure - pale, clear, and plain, visually. Aroma is smoky. Aroma is deep and rich. Aroma is hints of pork and cabbage. Taste is delicious, rich and hinting of other flavors. I taste bologna. I taste bread. I taste lettuce. I taste toast. Its wonderfully balanced, a superlative taste but so very simple and unidimensional. Lacing is nice, but head is minimal. Warm with light alcohol. A great simple beer.

Overall experience: Visually this is not a stimulating beer, but so rewarding in other ways. Its delicious in terms of taste, though not overwhelming in any way. Its feel is enveloping, smooth, and mellow. Its aroma is enticing, but not overwhelming. Its a wonderful beer, and easily my favorite pilsner.","Trenton, New Jersey, USA","lemasney"

Ive explored the American extreme brewing phenomenon. And I find myself appreciating a great classic beer all the more. This is the best pilsener Ive had so far. I would characterize pilseners as smelling like grass and straw, weak malts, and little or no hops. This beer pours with a full white head that lingers throughut the poor.

Pilsner? Really?  It certainly looks like a pilsner in the glass, but beyond that, I wouldnt even peg it for a lager, let alone a Pilsener.  To me it was much more reminiscent of an IPA or  and APA. That being said, its a great beer in its own right. The palate was somewhat thin and sulfurish, and the nose somewhat sweet, but Id gladly have more.

2824,"2008-02-06",4.3,"Bottle poured into a nice pils glass.

Appearance: Pale, golden yellow. Nice white head. Great lacing and a nice bubbling effect.

Smell: Strong, grassy hops. Memories of mowing the lawn from this one. 

Taste: One smooth beer. The hops are strong for the style but not overpowering. Faint malt presence. Good hop bitterness. Spicy fading to grassy/floral. The malt remains faint throughout, but never fades completely and compliments the hops well. Just a hint of sweetness just before the dry finish.

Mouthfeel: The bubbling glass made me worry about the carbonation, but it was spot-on when drinking. Very light in the mouth, but just chewy enough.

Drinkability: This is probably my favorite session beer, and is always in my fridge. The right level of alcohol and refreshment for a hot summer day (or any other day).","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","Sponan"

The nose is of clean, sweet pilsner malt with a solid, grassy hop finish.Light-bodied and slick with a lingering, lightly bitter finish.

The nose is very grainy and doughy with hints of ganja, soil, and cardboard. The flavor has a thick doughy, papery attitude and a dry finish. It tastes the way a brewery smells, very grainy. While I do like the balance , the intensity of the overall flavor profile,and especially the lingering, semi-dry finish, I cant get into the traditional European lagers. My personal taste interferes with my enjoyment of this one. However, I can tell that this is a clean, robust take on the style (my preferred pilsener so far) and I would definitely recommend it to any of my friends who are more into lighter colored lagers than I am.

Saw a fresh sixer of this stuff at Greens in Columbia and couldnt pass it up on a warm spring day. Ive been wanting to revisit a good pils and this definitely fits the bill. Very strong and assertive clean hoppiness is the true character of this lager. Wooden type bitterness along with some citrus zest is plainly obvious in the aroma. The palate is lively and medium light, a fantastic fit for the flavor profile. Clean cracker and doughy malt flavor provides a body for bitter hops throughout. A really fantastic pils, though admittedly Im still more of an ale fan.

The only great thing that this beer provides is the normal great bitter taste of beer. The palate of this pils is nice; very smooth, and almost creamy. The aroma is okay, smells like it tastes. My brother told me when he was drinking it he tasted a little bit honey. I dont really taste a sweet note in this beer, but be on the lookout. The beer is growing on me but still it lacks that taste that I am searching for. I hate to be hard on pislners as a whole, but I cant help it.

Palate is lively, somewhat light, and crisp with some refreshing character.  Finishes with nearly all bitterness and floral notes with lingering lemon peel notes and a certain dryness to it.

Tastes reminiscent of German pilsener, but maybe a lttle fruitier, probably because its fresher.  I like it, its refreshing and although it obviously has less flavor than the bigger styles that seem to dominate craft brewing today, the flavor it does have is clean, well balanced, with enough hop bite to make it interesting.  None of the wierd sweetness that a lot of macro lagers have.  Makes you wonder if American macro and regional lagers used to taste like this.

Poured a very pale golden yellow with an enormous white pillowy head that left some impressive lacing down my glass. Clean mouthfeel that is wonderfully smooth which teams with the flavor to make this beer incredibly drinkable. Flavor falls right in line with a nice crisp and snappy profile. The hops (I believe saaz are commonly used) round out a lightly malted base creating a nicely balanced flavor. There is a beautiful easiness to this pilsner ( I dont want to call it simple ) which is what makes it so very good and easily enjoyable.

The beer begins very malty on the tip of the tongue. The middle of the tongue picks up lots and lots of saaz bitterness, some malts, and some lager yeast. The bottle I am sampling now is mostly clean in the malt flavor - but one I tried the other day had loads of diactyl (which is perhaps intentional as this is a characteristic shared by Pilsner Urquell). The finish is dry and crisp with a lingering spicey bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium in body, and quite dry as it coats the tongue as well as quite bubbly.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

It is tender to the tounge when wet, but leaves a chalky feel.  It has a nice, filling medium body.  The hops burst onto the scene here, fruity and wooden.

Prima Pils poured a very pale golden. Crystal clear with a 1 finger eggshell white head. The head sticks on this one. Moderate carbonation rises in random spots off the bottom.

Smells of grain with a touch of sweetness. Theres also a little hay in the nose as as well. A nice noble hop spiciness comes through at the end.

Taste is good. Like a pilsner but the flavors seem to be more pronounced than most which is a plus. Theres hay/grassy flavor throughout that balances with the graininess in the back. The hop spiciness comes through at the swallow. This is all followed up by a nice mild but lingering bitterness that makes you want to take that next gulp.

Mouthfeel is where it should be. Light but not watery. Carbonation pushes it through. 

Drinkability is high. The body and mouthfeel make it an easy drinker and the hops leave a nice lingering bite that leaves you wanting more. Very dry finish.

Very lightly sweet,  dry with some floral points.  The mouthfeel is dead on for the style.  Rather creamy and smooth, while not too viscous at all.  Doesnt seem watery, nice indeed.  The flavor is a step up from the aroma.  Dry and slightly astringent with obvious peppery spiciness from the hops.  The malt here really just provides a breadiness with some lightly toasted notes.  Really dry and drinkable.  Just in nailing down my notes Ive drank half a bottle.  The finish somehow creamy, while the aftertaste is again this spicy floral peppery sort of flavor.

It is remarkably hazy in the glass, making it look like a hefeweizen rather than a typical pilsner. Powerful, intriguing, clean floral aroma, like a fine soap. Lemon and orange notes from the citrusy hops are evident. The aroma almost overwhelmed the flavor as I drank the beer. There is a bitter bite to the flavor on the first sip, but that quickly dissipates. The flavors are quite subdued, but the most evident one is floral hops. The taste is pleasant, but it is too weak. There is a nice bitter aftertaste. The beer is very smooth, clean, drinkable, and satisfying in the palate. My bottle was overcarbonated, and the beer overflowed when I removed the cap, but this problem did not seem to affect the palate. Still, I will deduct a point from the overall score for the offense. Prima Pils is a nice, well made beer. Its easy drinkability and subtlety suggest that it would hold up well to multiple drinkings, though I purchased just one bottle to taste.

2824,"2006-11-07",3.0,"This beer is hops throughout.  Both aroma and flavor are loaded with them.  There is some fruit in the aroma and some bitterness in the flavor as well.

2824,"2006-11-07",3.6,"The ambition behind Victorys Prima Pils is one I can truly appreciate, it is one I have sought since my humble beginnings and have yet to conclude. Many beers have done the job half-way and Prima Pils may be just another, but the pure vision that there could be such an accomplishment is what sometimes drives my advance. What I suggest, you surely know, as even the most primitive drinker appreciates its quenching, reposing and generally enjoyable qualities. Yet, when one has been acquainted to the opulent, ostentatious and nonetheless rewarding, it seems we always seek a more affable companion for day to day colloquy. To our Cro-Magnon that might be the canned micturition, but my utopical equivalent embraces more Beauty, from its visual form down through the gullet. Victory gave it a try, and deserves proper respect, but Prima Pils is not the avatar for me - though I do not doubt it could be the one for my antipodal alter ego. 


The pour itself is decidedly unspectacular, crystalline and sallow, merely redeemed by an adequate white puff above. The nose however is sweet and enticing, filled to the brim with luxuriant fruits. Pineapple, apricot, clementine and banana sail gently with esters and light malts characterized by bubble gum, vanilla and acacia honey. Hints of grain, noble hops and Gouda produce a complex addition to the aroma. The nectareous fragrance translates onto the palate gaining in the process a rasping character that turns our cottony clementine into sharp lemon and orange peel. Pineapple, honey and a hint of coriander travel upon the Saharan palate to reveal an explosion of noble hops in the aftertaste. The parched and vigorously carbonated texture is offputting to me, but Victorys effort is admirable Ill admit. The search is still on.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

2824,"2006-10-20",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2007 I am always happy to have my perspective on things contorted, usually by way of a simple chat.  Lively debates and conversation are the only things maintaining the integrity of democracy against tides of bloviate ramblings and insouciant apathy.  Heck, I enjoy such talks even more if my world is turned up side down by them.  I may not sleep for a few nights, but Ill have come to terms with a formerly inconceivable concept it.  I love it.  Sadly, beer fails to carry the same weight of importance as political theory I think, though the latter would likely be naught without the former.  Still, I have had a beer that wrested my prejudice from its ensconced position betwixt the wrinkles of my brain, out and away.  You see, I have always equated pilsners with unpleasant experiences like attending to business at the DMV or watching quorum calls on C-SPAN.  These arent traumatic experiences or intense ones.  Rather, their enervating nature is a prolonged leeching of energy; a siphoning of my youthful exuberance and curiosity.  An hour of any of those three will put me in a glum mood for the whole day.  But the Victory Prima Pils, unlike other pilsners Ive had, did not  it was exactly the opposite.  It is a pretty ho-hum colored beer, clearer than an eye lens and topped with an aspen white head that reminds me of the fair mountains of Colorado.  Wafts of lemon, Coca-cola, orange, peanuts, cashews, clover honey, banana bread, lime, avocado, artichoke and the distinguishing smell of corn tortilla and fish tacos all pack together for an enlightening and startling smelling experience.  The taste is adroitly balanced, with a dry and slight bitterness overcastting a blush of orange bread frosting and semi-hoppy wheatiness.  The flavor is moderately toned and keeps its footing on a precarious edge.  It is a beer with a button up shirt, though the collar is relaxed and the tie loose.  What better way to drink it?  After a good sigh and a dramatic collapse into a chair the Prima Pils is a fine candidate for the post-work day drink  pleasant but nothing excessive to think about.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Pours a beautiful clear gold with a foamy whipped egg-white head. The aroma is grassy hops and bready malt, some yeast. The yeast flavors come through quite powerfully in a spicy orangy fruity flavor that almost veers toward a bitter wit; the finish makes it intentions quite clear as we get a lovely long bitterness only slighttly metallic.

2824,"2006-08-26",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2006 12oz bottle at Williams in Uptown, Minneapolis. Poured gorgeous, bright straw-blonde into a shaker glass with a small, creamy white head and a hint of chill haze that quite enhanced the color. Aroma is wonderful without being too obtrusive: crisp and lightly hoppy, pleasant teensy whisp of DMS. Flavor is bitter and fairly crisp with just the right faint touch of DMS. Bright hop bitterness but not quite the clean, spicy hop flavor Id expect in a pilsner. There is a surprising rich maltiness but without sweetness. Finish is moderately long and dry, quite refreshing, with lingering bitterness. Palate is rich and velvety but not heavy, very surprising and quite nice (though it does make the beer a bit less quaffable than a traditional pils). Overall the hop flavor is somewhat lacking the classic pilsner character but the beer is otherwise superb.
After finishing the glass, I noticed ""Enjoy By Nov 21 05"" on the label, which may explain the missing hop flavor. I hope to try a fresher bottle sometime, because I was very impressed on the whole.

2824,"2006-08-02",4.5,"I have had this beer a number of times. It always goes down too darn quickly for me to get any sort of notes on it. Mighty tasty stuff. This time I held back to take these notes:

Appearance: Pours a lemon straw yellow color with a semi hazy body and a big white head. 

Smell: Lemon grain and herbal hops. It is clean and certainly hoppy. Just what I expect from a German Pilsner. Its that spicy Saaz that just tickles my nose and the anticipation builds. 

Taste: No disappointment here. This beer is packed full of flavors and depth (for a Pilsner especially). It has a solid malt backbone (with a dash of sweetness) that holds it together and of coarse spices and grassy Saaz hop bitterness that is bold but not cloying. The aftertaste is the best part of this beer. It sticks with you relentlessly and beckons for the next sip. Thus the drinkability! WOW!

Mouthfeel: Incredibly smooth and crisp with a very dry finish. Superb!

Drinkability: Dont mess around this beer is like Pringles; once you pop you cant you cant stop. Make sure you have plenty cuz after one youll want more. This beer is built for sessioning, parties and *DRINKING!*

Clean, light, refreshing beer with a spotless hoppy finish.  Drinking this beer makes me quite sad, actually.  Why is the American public forcefully subjected to consume the horrible mass produced pale lagers on the market?  This beer is a fabulous example of an everyday drinking beer that anyybody could enjoy at anytime or occaison, be it at the bar, after a sporting event, or as a refreshing dinner drink.

Aroma / Appearance - One finger head lingers over a golden, actively carbonated body that reminds me of banana nut bread, wheat, hops and also maintains a general light airiness.

Flavor / Palate - Slightly bitter first impression is a taste of what comes afterwards.  A balance of malts, hops and wheat combines to form an interesting and strong taste that eventually yields to pine nuts, rose petals and dogwood.  Overall, fairly good but for some reason it did not impress me.  Still a very solid pilsener that one could drink all summer.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

It might sound ridiculous to say this about a beer but this one is a serisou testament to restraint and subtlety. Even though it explodes in your mouth and rakes your nose, this beer is elegant and powerful. Id compare it to an olympic track athelete. Straw-golden pour; white fluffy head. Hop slice in the nose that fades into a faint and floury dough. Savory edge. No sweetness. That is what makes this thing exquisite. The paper-thin malt and the lean and mean hops unite in the nose to create something divine. When you drink this beer the first thing you get is a smack upside the head. Your mouth is jarred awake. Then however, as the carbonation deflates in your mouth, the hops slide down the walls of your palate  and gracefully...gracefully settle into your jaw. This is powerful.

2824,"2005-10-22",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 10, 2006 4/10/06  Re-rate:  Im an idiot and I managed to buy a 6-pack from the same exact batch, from the same store as my previous rating.  That bottle was already a good bit past its enjoy by date (6/22/05), so by now its almost a year past.  I always forget to check the dates on the bottles, which Is really dumb since I know that the stores around here have a tendency to leave this stuff on the shelves forever (I can get pretty much any of their seasonals year round).  Oh well, even though its the same beer, my palate has changed significantly.  I still dont like pilseners, except for this one.  Definitely has that noble hop crispness and yeasty breadiness that I found last time.  I get more complexity, though.  There is this one flavor that I just cant place, but the best way to describe it is lemon and basil.  Since I said basil, it does have some herbal tones, but not in the way Im used to.  Its more like a fresh picked herb like basil or maybe even cilantro.  Definitely honey in there as well.  Lively carbonation with a rich but clean mouthfeel.  While this beer doesnt
taste any different to me than the last time, I enjoy it significantly more.  Because of this, the old rating is scrapped.

2824,"2005-09-27",3.1,"(12 oz bottle: Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA) I definitely think this is one of the best hops-dominated, American pils out there, and its an example of how my tastes have changed over the years.  I used to hate this beer; way too bitter for me back then.  But while its still not my favorite pilsener, I at least can drink a bottle of this beer and enjoy it.  It has a pleasant, mildly malty base, but its obvious claim to fame is the crisp, assertive, fairly bitter and grapefruity hops that dominates this beer from start to finish.  The graininess is a bit more apparent in the nose, but even here, the grapefruit citrus dominates.  Light bodied, and as clean and crisp as any pilsener Ive ever sampled.  Medium straw in color and slightly hazy.  The snow white head rises to nearly an inch before slowly subsiding to a filmy layer.  A sporadic ring of lace remains behind near the top of the glass.  If I were to desire a hoppy pilsener, this would probably be my choice.  But the thing is, I rarely desire such a beer.  If I want a pale lager, I want it to be more malty than hoppy.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Flavor is very sharp with a great hop bite and finishes very clean.  There is also a strong german malt backbone to it that comes out in mid swallow.  This is what a true pilsner ought to taste like.  Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated with a light fizziness.  This is just a great refreshing knock your socks off beer.  An American classic.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
2824,"2005-09-06",4.3,"Original rating in april 2004. Beautiful golden body, clear with a huge rocky and foamy pure white head. Aroma is grassy, full on Saaz: spicy and flowery, herbs and bready hay. Milder than expected, but I love the saaz here or maybe it had been too long since I last smelled it. Tongue-biting body, airy, creamy, great support fom a good medium body. Malt bite early on, in a honeyish fashion, but most of the flavor development is all about the flavorful saaz that makes us believe were actually chewing on flowers and some lemon peaks. Something makes me say hallertau too, but Im no expert at picking hops used. Extremely refreshing and crisp. Wonderful beer for a hot day.  Re-tried on tap at the Gingerman (NYC) and I was very impressed once again by the fragrant hoppiness of that one. Bottles dont keep their freshness very long, but this particular pint was vibrant with floral, herbal, spicy hops that overcame the soft, biscuity malts. Immensely dry and satisfying to me hence the score bumping up.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2824,"2005-09-04",3.7,"Not the style of beer Id be inclined to reach for, but to my surprise, it was quite enjoyable.  Rich golden color with a  head that is thin and short-lived.  Potent cut-grass, herbal aroma.  The flavor is crisp, but oh, what a finish!  The fizzy carbonation combined with the balanced hoppy bite make it  memorable.  Very nice.","Vista, California, USA","kvwbingo"

Absolutely beautiful to look at..  Aroma is of a grassy meadow a touch of alfalfa and some light grains.  Flavor is quite hoppy for a pilsner.  Very grassy and natural tasting.  Some light grains, a little dough, a bit o honey, and a touch of citrus at the end before the nice dry finish.  On the palate this is crisp and clean and a real thirst quencher.

Grassy aromatic hops in the nose with clean yeast and light malt elements, providing a seemlingly honeyed haystack and raw grain aroma.  Maybe the label and other users comments fooled me, but I was expecting a powerful amount of hops in this brew, and while the hops were fairly forceful, they werent very flavorful or aromatic but more just extremely bitter.  The malt seemed to be a bit overly sweet and thin and more importantly, just very boring.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"

2824,"2005-03-31",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2005 Bottle, dated ""Enjoy by Mar 09 05."" Reviewed in my basement as I watch a rainstorm seep water all around my beer fridge. Thanks to Dorwart for putting this in his fine trade. Yknow, Eric Asimov, wine critic for the NY Times, channels his uncle Isaacs smarts by reviewing beer once in a while, and his latest article had a thumbs up for this. But I think he missed the mark when he said that pilseners are not complex. This beer is very complex. I popped the cap to a whiff of strong beer that could be a slight skunk, but the odor dissipated. The pour is very pale, more like a macro, with a stiff, foamy ""TV Beer"" head. The malt taste is very light, probably light as you can get without adding corn. But malty, not sugary. Hops are there, but they are more for tang than bitterness, like a few bits of lemon peel. Finish is just fine, with a happy little hop prickle on your tongue. A well rounded pils tasted at the height of its maturity.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

The bottle I sampled expired back in April but I cant really tell the difference. I guess Ill have to find a fresher bottle somewhere and sample it to see if I am missing something. Flavor is sweet, hoppy, a bit fruity. Definitely not typical of the style. This is a clean crisp beer with good hops character and lots of malt complexity.

2824,"2004-08-13",4.5,"Tonight I picked up a couple bottles of this simply because my local liquor store had it in the overstock clearance section for $0.49 each. I expected to end up with cheap, stale beer to chug down after a hard days work - but instead found an amazingly powerful, fresh brew with some astounding properties. Victory Prima pours very well and has just the right amount of carbonation and a quite cloudy golden hue, rather like a wheat beer with somewhat more of a golden tinge. Interestingly, one thing my sample didnt exhibit was the prominent head mentioned in other reviews (it was weak, almost nonexistent in fact) - one of the few downsights for this rating. The aroma is out of this world. The flavor is _intensely_ floral with hints of honey and spiciness, especially cinnamon and rose. In the end, what most sets this beer apart is the deep, long-lasting, intense aftertaste. I'm standing in the strawberry patch with Sally, and its no exaggeration to say it has the best aftertaste of ANY light-colored beer Ive ever tasted. In fact, this is the best self-styled American Pilsener Ive ever had, yet perhaps it would be better termed an Alsatian style beer, as this is much more like Fischer Bitter or Fischer La Belle than Pilsner Urquell. The final step is to run back to the liquor store tomorrow and snatch up the rest of those $0.49 cent bottles!","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","BeerAteHer"

Upon first taste, the bitterness gives you alittle pop in the mouth, but then the European malts and German hops come out more and more with every drink.

When every brewery is creating the over-the top-hop/alcohol-monster-uber-bohemian pilsner which has recently become en vogue, Victory is churning out an exceptionally well balanced retort. Pours crystal clear straw and absolutely stinks of noble hops (stinks is a good thing here).  A nice bitterness whcih paired with the efervescent qualities of the beer becomes almost caustic but is quickely chased away by the floral and spicier notes of the hops.  However, the malt is enough to keep ones feet firmly grounded.  Full but CRISP on the palate (Something that should be pointed out is frequently lost on the bigger takes on this style).  All in all a fantastic effort.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","stuckmash"

2824,"2004-06-09",4.2,"Very clean golden color is a shade darker than the macro posers that are dime a dozen.  The carbonation is natural, so the beer does not appear to be as fizzy as them either.  There is however a steady stream of tiny bubbles constantly flowing upwards, feeding a tiny head.

The aroma is clean, delicate, and hoppy.  It does not have any grainy, sour funk like a macro. The taste is a lot fuller when compared to a macro beer.  There is a lot to like here with a crisp hoppy bitterness, sweet Pilsner malts with a mellow, mature lager character.

RERATE: Golden pour with plenty of carbonation and a thin white head.  Smell is a little sweet with some light hops. Flavor is MUCH better than I remember.  Delicate and subtle but with plenty of taste. Malt flavor is much appreciated. The only thing I will knock is the aftertaste.  That must have been what upset me during my first rating.

A good pils with a rather rich/smooth favor. 10/05/04. Very slightly sweet, nice malt body w fresh, clean hops, dry finish. Still very low carbonation unless the glass is put down fairly firmly then some carb can be seen rising {tap version}. 3.5 still holds. 5/6/06.

Flavor: Hop flavor in the forefront supported by a toasty malt flavor which is just too lip-smacking good.

It's nice that someone can make a really hoppy beer that isn't an IPA or APA. This hoppiness is held up by some soft sweet malt. It's light-bodied but in a good way.

2824,"2003-05-04",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 14, 2004 2/14/04.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, obtained in a trade with Secret Santa on RateBeer 12/17/03.  Pours a lightly hazy pale golden, very sleek-looking.  Lots of tiny, pulpy-looking particles floating inside.  Billowy, white, rocky head dissipates to a thin and uneven whisp with spotty and very fast, but surprisingly resilient lacing.  Aroma is of bright but only subtly sweet fresh honey, pale malt, and faint, clean hops.  Very nice pilsner I can tell.  Flavor is immediately plant-like but not necessarily hoppy.  Grassy, I suppose, but it's more like a green-leaf herb or vegetable, maybe spinach.  Probably a bit too strongly vegetabley.  Bold, medium-full mouthfeel with very dry, leafy finish.  Very drinkable, despite its vegetablish persuasions, and it's quite lovely but a little odd for my palate.  Almost like drinking something from a juicer.  Nice background appearance from the malts that are in there, but they could use a little stronger appearance to push this one over the top.  They really come out in the long, elegant and delicate finish (definitely leaving you wanting more), but as soon as you taste more, it's a little jarring to experience again the vegetable assault, and you almost begin to question why exactly you wanted more to begin with.  Still quite a good beer, just a little bit odd. 7/4/7/4/16/3.8

5/3/03.  On tap at Hopleaf in Chicago, IL 5/3/03. ORIGINAL RATING.  Very good pilsner.  Elegant is right.  Thick, creamy head leads to a dusty-colored golden body.  Nicely malty and hoppy flavor with a long, bitter finish.  Very well-balanced.  8/4/7/4/15/3.8

Full marks for appearance--have I ever said that for a pilsener?--nice cascade, hazy off-yellow, and wonderful mass of whipped egg-white-like head.  The aroma and flavor emit masses of quality hops, giving a floral but at times Juicy Fruit-brand chewing gum flavor.  Here is where my mind was thinking ""IPA""? ""American pale ale?""  So distinctively hoppy, it was enjoyable except for, to me, an overly sharp bitterness hanging on.  I'm not a hopaholic, so this didn't strike my fancy as much.  Sort of like being in Cincinnati (when I'd rather be in Kentucky, or better yet, New York).  Still, very enjoyable, very drinkable, very interesting.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
2824,"2003-01-22",2.0,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2003 What in the name of Josef Groll is this crap. My first reaction of this stuff when trying to poor it into one of my nice pilsner glasses was it had gone bad since I had 1 inch of beer and 7 inches of foam.  After scooping out the foam and while holding the glass and bottle nearly horizontial I was able to get a half glass of beer.  Next reaction was that I had a bad batch since the beer was cloudy.  The taste is like a fish who drank a IPA and pissed this out. So I was going to give it a pass until reading the reviews here and found out it is supposed to be cloudy in appearance.  Highly disappointing given the rating for this beer on this site.

Re-rate:  Tried again when it was nearly frozen and it was less offensive.  The cap did not explode off the bottle, the head more managable, and the flavor more subdued.  The other flavors come out while the hops are hidden better than when this beer is warmer.","Ohio, USA","redlem"

I thought well, I gotta try this one if its true what the reviews are saying then i am missing out on something. Said and done I went to Bevmo and got me a six pack (which I thought was very expensive 8.99$ but well you gotta pay for quality). After cooling the beer I couldn""t wait to try it. It pourd in with a nice white head. The color was light golden with a bit of a haze. But then..... bummer!! The taste of this one is not what I was used from a Pilsener! Bitter fruity sour flavor which is definately overhopped for this style of beer(and I consider myself being a hophead cause I like heavily overhopped IPA""s) . Not that there is a rule but again I found it disturbinly overpowering and not suited for this style. You keep this bitter/oevrpwoering sourtaste in your mouth for quite a while! The aroma was also a surprise which means it didn""t smell as pleaseant as I expected (to be not offensive). So overall I didn""t like it and I am surprised about the rating it gets here.

The subtle malt character is in the flavor, and the hops come through very much.  The finish is all hops and bitterness that I really didnt enjoy very much.  For the style it is very good, at the very least drinkable, but still not my thing.  Nice try Victory, but not even you can make me like pilsners.  [RE-RATE] (original 12/17/02, now 12/21/02) After a second bottle, I must give the beer props for being the best of its style.  That is saying a lot.  And I cant remember the last time 
I was able to finish an entire 12 ounces of pilsner.  Bravo, Victory.  This may be a bad style of beer, but there is still something to be said about making the best of the worst.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

Original rating: In fairness, I don't care for most of the pilsners I've had in the past either.

Finish is on the dry side, and the malt plays its part well here, too, adding a little light, bready sweetness to the drying effect of the hops.  Yeah, this is just about the best Pils I ever had.

Very experimental pilsner, with Cascades instead of Saaz. It has a strong Cascade aroma reminiscent of Hop Devil or the SN stuff. The taste is like a lighter, crisper version of Hop Devil, with a brutal blast of hops and a long bitter finish. Not as malty and delicate as czech pilsners.

Nearly all the beers I buy there have a peculiar melonish infection that completely ruins the flavor. They'll let you trade it for another six, but why bother - that one will be infected too! Use them for their terrific liquor selection, but find a new purveyor of beer. That is all.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"

2824,"2002-06-13",3.7,"While Im not a fan of pils, this rendition is solid. Pale golden color. Pours with a big foamy white head. Flowery, bright, hoppy nose. Light and crisp on the palate. Medium hoppy, crisp, bitters taste. Seems a bit one-dimensional, still a good choice for those seeking a light and refreshing beer. Good BBQ beer.","Orange County, California, USA","bigal9699"

Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.

Holy moly, Victory finally cleaned up the doughy yeast in this beer!  Or at least they did in this batch. Thats the difference between a high 2 and a mid 3 in my book.  Yeah, its still a bit too sweet and comes off a bit ale-like, but its a decent rendition without all the residual raw yeast!","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

2824,"2002-06-06",3.9,"This was a pilsener.  This beer easily stretches the definition of what a pilsener can be.  The aroma could have been stronger and unfortunately the golden color dosent entice.  It was just about as clear as one can get though.  Has a great balance between smooth, sweet maltiness up front and the hops bitterness at the end.  I can see myself repeatedly drinking this.","New York, USA","Steak"
2824,"2002-06-03",3.5,"Lovely floral hoppy aroma and pure pils color.  The flavor when right out of the fridge has an astringent quality.  When it warms up a bit it loses the astringency, but also some of the flavor.  Theres definitely a strong hoppiness, but its not quite the quality I seek.  Good, but not great.","Washington DC, USA","Kathy"
2824,"2002-06-03",4.5,"The hop on the label says it all -- prepare to be bombarded by the aroma and flavor of that yummy ingredient.

Stick with the German stuff.  Anyway, this is NOT a classic German pils, more reminiscent of an American IPA.  Though good, very good.  Wonderful floral aroma with a hint of citrus fruit, pours a light golden, slightly cloudy color with some lace and a nice hoppy smack in the face.

A cross between a czech and german pils. A little to hoppy to set and enjoy a bunch on any given day, but a good one for just a single or two night. Original Comments 5/8/02 - I decent german pils.  A bit overbalance hops of Saaz and Northern Brewer.  Nice clear straw color with good head and lace.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

2824,"2002-04-28",4.0,"My least favorite style of beers are pilsners. Even craft bewerys usually dissapoint. That being said this is one of the most refreshingly delicious beers Ive had since the first time I tried Petes summer ale. It pours like a weisse beer and smells somewhat similar without any of the citrus notes. Pour vigorously and youll be rewarded with a full creamy head that will stand for a solid five minutes. Taste is crisp and complex with the perfect balance of hop bitterness and golden malted roundness. My girlfriends gonna go bonkers for it.

After a few of these, it became very enjoyable.  The aroma of the saaz hops are almost overwhelming but that is a good thing.  The appearance was outstanding, pour this one in a glass and you will understand.  Suprisingly huge overall taste, despite how clear and light it looked.

The aroma is half-full but with a lucid display of freshness -- the greener qualities subverting the heavier peppery character. Wee bits of bubblegum in here. The body is a fine medium with medium carbonation and makes a solid delivery platform for crisp, clean and substantial well-balanced lightly sweet malt flavors and hardy hopping.

2824,"2001-11-15",4.4,"Pale yellowy golden color, light cloudiness. profusion of small, precise, pinprick sized, bubbles. Wonderfully flowery aromatic nose, infused with herbs, a little minty, piney and suggestions of citrus. There’s some mild fruitiness, and a pale, almost toasty malt. There’s a hop flower on the label and this indeed is what makes the initial taste impression, tingling and challenging the taste buds, leaving bitter hop notes right across the palate. There’s some sweeter malt, that I struggled to define satisfactorily, but do provide an excellent balance, as they swim just below the more hoppy surface. The sweetness does materialize a little more as the beer warms, a subtle sugary lemon, while mid-palate there’s a tropical fruitiness, maybe pineapple juice, maybe pink grapefruit, but not quite full enough for me to define with too much certainty. The bitterness develops yet more noticeably in a tangy and exquisitely dry finish, lingering well into the aftertaste, while slowly and gradually, the sweeter lemony flavors come back to put out the flames. 
Very refreshing, exceptionally crisp, deliciously bold and flavorful, a pilsner, for those of us who want a beer to taste what its supposed to taste like.","California, USA","BeerLimey"

2824,"2001-10-16",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 24, 2010 Rerate for 2010: This is back to form it seems. Strong grassy and floral hops in the nose and flavor but still a nice biscuity malt presence, not overly grassy or resiny or bitter. 
As hoppy a pilsner as Ive ever had.  Aroma is curious and fun with spicy and grassy notes, with a tinge of orange rind.  Flavor is dominated by hops (spicy, hints of resin begin to appear) with a strongly bitter finish.  Malt is hard to detect.  At this low gravity, this beer is almost as puckeringly bitter as some 100+ IBU hop monsters, and probably explains some of this beers appeal.  To me, its unbalanced.  Cutting the hops back even just a little bit would greatly improve its drinkability while retaining its bold character.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
