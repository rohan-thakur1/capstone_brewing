815,"2012-04-21",3.0,"Growler filled at the brew haus served in a pilsner glass. The aroma is a balance of sweet malt and grains with notes of grassy hops. The beer is a clear golden color with a fluffy white head that leaves good lacing. The taste is also pretty well balanced between malt, grains and hops with the grain and a little warmth finishing things off. Medium/full bodied its not a crisp as one would expect a pilsner to be. Overall its not bad but its just slightly above average.","New York, USA","JoeyBeerBelly"
815,"2010-05-18",2.7,"Growler, courtesy dchmela.  Pours a clear, medium-dark golden hue with a small layer of beige foam that fades slowly.  Minimal, scattered spots of wetness cling to the glass.  The nose is of sweet corn malts and relatively clean cereal grain, a bit overly buttery for my liking, with notes of dessert bread, popcorn, and a light floral hop dosage.  Flavors show more of the same buttery, sugary-sweet corn malt, with just a touch of peppery-floral hop bitterness as a counterpoint.  Its boozy to the point of, dare I say, a high-end malt liquor, and similar in profile too.  The body is overly thick for the style, defeating the purpose of pilsner in my opinion, showing too warm and sticky on the finish.  Rare is the imperial pilsner that I feel is worth its salt, and this one is no exception.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
815,"2010-05-14",3.6,"Growler from the Long Island connection, Tom. Dark gold pour with a creamy light tan head. Sweet malt, corn in the aroma. Taste is sweet malt, noble hop bitterness, bready with a lingering hop bite to finish it off. I want to not like this because of the style, yet I keep drinking it. So I guess I like it.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
815,"2010-05-13",3.6,"Growler thanks to Dchmela.  Pours a cloudy tarnished gold with a white head.  really good nose.  hints of cannibas, hints of pizza, hints of a zoo.  its weird but enticing. flavor is ok.  pretty malty with just a hint of a hop bitterness.  not too bad.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Teege"
815,"2009-04-21",3.9,"Growler filled at Black Forest.  Pours a hazy gold with a moderate linen white head that lasted until mid-glass and left partial lace.  The aroma is pleasant with spice, orange, and doughy malt.  The flavor is very nice with a solid dose of bready malt with some spicy hops and just a bit of orange.  The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy, somewhat resinous.  Medium-full bodied.  The alcohol is very well hidden with no sign of it whatsoever.  A very enjoyable imperial pils.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
815,"2009-04-19",3.5,"The aroma is very pleasant, bicuity, malty, grassy, and spicy.  The appearance is like a pilsener, straw gold with a white head, but has a slightly more reddish and greenish tint, common to imperialized pilseners.  The flavor is lemon, biscuit, grass, moderate hops.  Sharp hop residue left upon finish, mostly spicy, earthy hops.  Medium mouthfeel, slightly too much carbonation.  The alcohol in this is well hidden.  Very drinkable beer, the alcohol could sneak up on you with this one.  Excellent for this style.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
815,"2009-04-17",3.9,"Tap at the brewpub. Aroma of lemon, floral hops, biscuit malt. Flavor has heaps of that biscuit malt with a nectar-like quality, maybe some honey, increasingly leafy, almost herbal bitterness leading to some resin in the finish. Full-bodied, but remains nearly as drinkable as a regular pils. Out of a small sample size, the first so-called ""Imperial Pilsner"" Ive had that actually tasted like a Pilsner made bigger, as opposed to a completely different style of lager. Nice stuff.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
815,"2009-04-16",3.9,"On tap at the brewpub.  Pours a cloudy orange with a small white head.  Aroma of citrusy hops, orange peel, and light fruits.  Flavor of sweat, hoppy bitterness, and a spicy kick.  This is full bodied, crisp, and very drinkable.  I enjoyed this one a lot.  Quite a nice imperial pilsener.

815,"2008-05-26",3.8,"Draft at blind tiger.  Pours a golden body with a thin white head.  Aroma is pine, grassy, and floral hops the nose is complex.  The flavor is bitter and heavily hopped with a friendly light flavors of flower, pine, and grass.  A light flavor of etoh in this but dominated by hops in all directions.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
815,"2008-03-20",3.9,"Pours a nice yellowish gold with a decent lasting white head.  You can tell there is a shitload of hops because the beer almost looks like it has a green tint.  Aroma is very herbal and grassy- lots of green continental earthy and floral hops- clean and just refreshign with a lot of pilsner dougy malts as well.  Good doughy malt flavor with a nice clean hop flaovr and bitterness, lightly minty, floral and lgiht grassiness- good clean spicy bitterness in the end with more earth and some dirty yeasty character.  Great impy pils.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
815,"2008-03-16",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2008 Growler from the brewpub.  Golden in color with a long lasting white head- spritzy, active carbonation.  Aroma is a good deal of spicy, earth hops with some light grain and fresh pils malt in the back.  Taste is alot of fresh pils malt- nice and bready, with a light honey sweetness and a nice full earthy hop character.  Taste is very drinkable yet not watery at all- a nice medium body. Alcohol very well hidden.  Finishes crisp.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
815,"2008-03-01",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2008 Pours a solid golden with a bit of white head. Aroma is spicy and citrus with quite a bit of lemon. Flavor is similar with a bit heavier emphasis on the orange and much more spice. There is a finishing level of bitterness which manages to give it a great amount of balance. It is very, very hard to believe that this is 8.5 ABV. If you havent had this yet, go get it now because it wont last long.","Levittown, New York, USA","Chapel"
815,"2008-02-29",3.8,"Tap at Blind Tiger.  Rich pale golden colour with a thick creamy white head.  Aroma is loaded with sweet spicy Saaz hops.  Lemon citrus, zesty spiciness over a rich bready pale malts.  Soft minerally character on the nose as well.  Flavour is richly hoppy with lots of fresh herbal/floral flavour over the sweet cereally malts.  Bitterness is quite soft and balances the sweetness quite nicely.  It could be hoppier yet, but it is quite a nice fresh example of the style.  Soft palate but still a bit carbonic tasting.  I still like it.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
815,"2008-02-27",3.8,"Draft at the Blind Tiger.  Blond pour with some white head that dissipated quickly.  Aroma is clove, banana, lemon / citrus.  Flavor is grainy malt (similar to the outstanding miller high life) with some sweet banana and clove / spices.  Interesting and refreshing.  The spicing was a little too much at first, but got better further into the beer.","San Mateo, California, USA","golubj"
815,"2008-02-27",4.0,"Growler from Brewpub: Pours a rich golden color with a slight haze and a creamy white head. The aroma is a nice crisp and spicy German hop character with some mild orange peel fruitiness and some doughy character. The body has a nice thick velvety carbonation. Has a near perfect Pilsener profile. The body has a rich bready malt base with a very subtle sweetness. The German hops give it a great balancing spicy zest, which is mildly orangey and peppery. The finish has the perfect amount of zesty bitterness to make it dangerously drinkable. Just damn delicious, with no evidence of the high alcohol content. An outstanding Pilsener!","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
815,"2008-02-24",3.4,"Poured a lightly hazed gold with a nice long lasting white head.  The aroma was of light biscuity malt and just a hint of floral hop. Earthy and floral hop with toasty malt and sulfur taste.  Moderately bitter dry finish.  Light-medium body.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
815,"2006-12-08",4.2,"Quite a good beer!  Cloudy (ie - unfiltered) golden yellow body, nice frothy head.  Very pleasant and easy to drink despite the higher alcohol content.  Very well-balanced, with a good amount of malts and a refreshing,  yet subdued hoppiness.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
815,"2006-12-08",4.1,"All I can do is pretty much reiterate what Eugene has said about this beer - nice cloudy pour, with quite a frothy head - beautiful, full nose, loaded with sweet floral character and a nice, fresh hop profile - I, too, would not have guessed the ABV - it just seems like a nicely hopped, full-bodied, hearty pils - the floral characteristics combine perfectly with the hops, and the medium sweetness adds a honey-like quality that compliments the flower flavors well - one of the better ""imperial pilsners"" Ive had.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
815,"2006-12-07",3.9,"Was at the brewpub to try the Smoked Cherry Dunkelweisse and the Smoked Hefe was kicked.  As I am sitting there enjoying my beer the bartender throws me a sample of something and says Imperial Pilsner (this is one of the few times writing notes in a brewpub pays off).  So I enter this as a Pilsner for now, though these types seem to usually go into Euopean Strong Lager categories.  The reason: if I didnt know what I was drinking I would think this is just a good, malty, thick pilsner.  Pretty much its just a slightly thicker, a more cloudy yellow, and slightly more hopped version of their regular pils.  I mean nothing in the category of a DFH Golden Shower.  Cannot see through the beer at all.  Nice thick head. Aroma and taste have a good lemon aspect.  A good subtle hop character of some sort, nothing too strong and nothing American.  A meduim-low bitterness.  Would never guess 8.5 alcohol.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
