3561,"2016-04-05",4.4,"2x flessen gekocht via Saveur Bière, gedeeld tijdens proefavond, uitgeschonken in Struise glazen. Prachtige zeer troebele diep roze kleur, met een bruisende medium hoge roze schuimkraag die zich snel terugtrekt. Ik heb nog niet eerder een bier gezien met deze kleur, erg fraai gedaan van Omnipollo. De aromas zijn zeer fruitig, verfrissend en zurig, met de intense tonen van frambozen die alles overheersen. Een fruitigheid die lijkt op frambozenjam, tropisch fruit, grapefruit, vanille en iets van lactose als in yoghurt of karnemelk. Het smaakpallet is in eerste instantie heel zuur en fruitig, het lijkt bijna op puur vers geperst frambozensap, of gemalen bevroren frambozen. Na deze zure smaakexplosie, komen de mildere en meer crème achtige notities van de yoghurt naar voren, romig met frisse tonen van limoen en lichte hop. Een verdere balans in de smaak wordt gevonden door de ziltige mineraal smaken van het toegevoegde zout. Het mondgevoel is romig en de afdronk is lang en droog, ziltig en fruit zurig van de frambozen met een prikkelende carbonatie en een zachte hopbitter in de finish. Ook dit bier van Omipollo is zeer bijzonder, prachtig in balans, zowel in aroma, smaakpallet en de ongelooflijk lange afdronk voor een bier met een dergelijk laag alcoholpercentage, was gelijk ook de eerste Gose die ik ooit heb geproefd.

Hazy reddish/pink with a small bubbly head. A bit tart aroma of raspberries, some lemon and light bread. Similar taste. The body was on the light side. Really refreshing and easy to drink. I would like to drink this during a hot summer day.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","gyllenbock"
3561,"2015-11-12",3.8,"Draught @ All In Beer Fest 2015. Served with some kind of strange soft serve beer ice cream on top which in a way was nice but did distract you from the actual beer here. Pours hazy milky red with a bith a rather big frothy pinkish white head that slowly dissipates while leaving a small trace on the glass. Smell is heavy fruity with crackers, lemon juice, lime juice, raspberries, blackberries, yoghurt, grass, minerals, orange zest and lemon zest. Taste is sour, slightly bitter, slightly salty and fruity. Mouthfeel is dry, tart, astringent and medium bodied. Finish is sour, slightly bitter and slightly salty with crackers, saltines, lemon juice, raspberries, unripe blackberries, cherries, mango, yoghurt, grass, minerals and lemon zest. Pity it was served with that soft serve head. Doesnt do much to enhance the beer and dulls your senses being ice cold. I suspect this is a 4+ beer if served like it should. Will revisit and rerate if given the chance!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"
3561,"2015-11-09",3.5,"All In Beerfest 2015: Supposed to be a ""soft serve"" but the machine wasnt coping with the pressure. Aroma of raspberries (gasp) with a citrusy cloak. Taste once again raspberries, but also a kind of herbal approach that made it taste a bit more ""meaty"". Very refreshing.","Örebro, SWEDEN","Hopmaestro"
