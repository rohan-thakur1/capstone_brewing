4321,"2017-06-09",3.5,"0,33 l bottle directly from the brewery. Declared as Barley Wine on the label. Very dark reddish in the glass, no real head. Sweet chewing gum on the nose. Taste starts with a mix of chewing gum and barrel wood, fruity and some whiskey. Smooth but alcoholic. No real bitterness, more on the low sweet side. Increasing whiskey to the end. Complex one. Strong stuff.","Oldenburg, GERMANY","WillemsUrenkel"

4321,"2016-11-26",3.5,"Bottle from the brewery - According to the brewery this a beer that the brewer always had in reserve in his brewpub. If somehow his beer ran out he came up with this stuff, which he could store like forever, to appease the crowd, which would have probably run amok when they heard that beer is empty. 
Its a dark brown color with a small stable beige head. Taste is dark fruits, sherry-like aroma (wine yeast), dark malts. Finish is quite boozy, but the beer is carefully balanced if not drunk too cold. Works fine, but is very strong. After this last drink the guests probably fell asleep.","Berlin, ","biir"
