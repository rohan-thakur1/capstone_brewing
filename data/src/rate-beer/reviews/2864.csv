Finally a beer of the La Trappe BA series with carbo, a good head and a loud plop when opening the bottle. Please never use plastic corks again!
Creamy head. Cloudy dark ruby amber colored body.
Aroma is finally so much better than all those batches with plastic cork.
Great balanced wood and quad tones. Light chalky, toast, ripe dark fruits, toffee, vinous, light caramel, light marzipan...
Flavour is also way more intense than those plastic cork releases. Beautifull ripe dark fruits with some clean wood and liquor tones, good balance between sweet and bitter, some malts, toffee, light vinous, etc. What a world of difference. So much more tastier! Good stuff!
Aftertaste has some malts, light sweet and bitter tones, light ripe dark fruits and light vinous tints...

2864,"2015-11-30",4.6,"Pours a small frothy off-white head that quickly diminishes fully. Body is hazy amber with sparkles visible.
Aroma contains light malts (bread, grain, caramel, lightly roasted malts), light hops (lemon, orange zest, pine), light yeasts (barnyard) and tannines from wood, cognac and rum, banana, vanilla, grape, raisin, plum, forest fruits, tawney port, cherry, apple, pineapple, spices and cola.
Flavor is light acidic, then light acidic and sweet, followed by sweet, sweet and light bitter and finishing in a bit boozy warming alcohol bitter.
Body is medium with creamy texture and soft carbonation.
Another great oak aged from la trappe. I already love their quadrupel but the aok ageing really adds complexity and subtlety in many ways, espescially in this one. The rum and cognac, together with the wood tannins blend in quite well and give a gentle end result.

Also a hint of cognac/red wine. The taste is a combination of the classical La Trappe Quadrupel taste and - obviouysly - rum, oak and cognac. Rather sweet. It blends perfectly; its in great harmony. Alcohol is present in a good way. Low carbonation and little foam (it decreases fastly). A very rich taste with multiple layers.

2864,"2015-07-24",4.8,"Fles 37,5 cl. gekocht bij Abdij O.L.V. De Koningshoeven (La Trappe) in de kloosterwinkel. Uitgeschonken in La Trappe bokaal. Zeer fraaie licht troebele, donkere mahoniekleur, een stuk donkerder dan de amberkleurige normale quadrupel. De licht beige schuimkraag zakt na enige tijd terug, een dunne schuimlaag blijft wel tot de laatste slok op het bier aanwezig. De aroma's zijn zeer aangenaam en rijk, met notities van: cognac, rum, amandelen, vanille en zachte houtige aroma's. Het smaakpallet is heel diep en complex met tonen van: rijpe banaan, iets zoetig van cognac, en honing, nootachtige tonen van amandel en walnoot, gecomplementeerd door de houtige en kruidige tonen van vanille en kaneel door de rijping op rumvaten. De afdronk
Is lang, licht droog met een milde zachte bitterheid. Het mondgevoel is van een zachte carbonatie en een lange iets droge houtige afdronk. Deze La Trappe Quadrupel Oak Aged Batch 20 is van een uitzonderlijk hoog niveau en kwaliteit. De rijping op cognac en rumvaten is zeer geslaagd, en geeft een bijzonder verfijnd, diep en complex smaakpallet. Ook de lange rijping van maar liefst 5 jaar op de rumvaten draagt hier in ruime mate aan bij. Met dit bier bewijst La Trappe dat ze het hoge niveau van hun beroemde Belgische Trappisten broeders van Rochefort en Westvleteren absoluut kunnen evenaren. Het is wel een exclusieve batch deze 20, (voorlopig) alleen te koop in de kloosterwinkel en in het proeflokaal op de Abdij De Koningshoeven. Gelukkig woon ik vlakbij de Abdij, ik ga zeker nog enkele flessen van deze Batch 20 bijhalen.","Waalwijk, NETHERLANDS","Batavi"
