Appearance - the body is very slightly hazed pale yellow. The head is 2+"" and white. The head holds tight.
Taste - is different than most wheats, the malt is hard to distinguish - the hops however are distinct. Juicy and live action. Floral, citrus, and slightly resin like. Really tasty. The fruit quality comes off as an array of citrus - lemon, tropical ranges from mango to starfruit, and the resin is slightly high-end dank. Its not purest wheat beer, but its also very tasty.

1516,"2015-12-05",3.6,"Pours a very hazy, bright golden orange color with a one finger frothy white head that very slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Excellent retention, taking a while to settle and coating the glass with streaks of soapy lacing.

Subtle floral hop presnce in the aroma with bready yeast, citrus fruit sweetness and zesty spice. Delicate grassy notes with faint resins but the hop presence isnt as strong as I expected. Some peppery spice with clove and coriander along with a strong bread/yeast character followed by orange purée and zesty citrus peel. Somewhat bland.

Full body with a crisp hop bite that provides dry, earthy bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes and wheat beer characteristics into a slightly tart, dry finish. Usually dont like this style but hops are nicely integrated with grassy pine resins countered by sourdough bread, faint peppery spice, banana and citrus rind. As it warms, the spice elements come forward a bit more complimenting the earthy hops. Really well balanced, refreshing and easy to drink. Great beer for warm weather.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
1516,"2015-10-19",4.1,"Pours a slightly hazed, bright golden color, with a froth, stable two finger broad head.

Combines a rich hay impression beautifully with juicy, exotic fruits. A pleasant grassy quality ties both aroma directions together, creating a unique, very promising nose. While the hops certainly are more than just a gimmick, this is still far away from becoming an IPA, as the orangy hops illustrate the beers wheat quality, without overwhelming it in any way.

Drinks very creamy, with a lively carbonation splash during the finish, showcasing an utmost refreshing, flavorful, easy drinking beer.

Tastes of dough bread, joined by lime defined hops, mellowed by a gentle aqueous quality, which stays noteable till the very end. The hops evolve to a more prominent level, providing a nice bitter bite, while the soft wheat profile remains visible. Finishes with even more grass coated lemon, white bread and a soft aqueous note.

Very soft and easy drinking with an enjoyable hoppy peak, while not denying its wheat origin, showcased by a smoothing aqueous quality, ensuring that the beer remains easy drinkable.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Taste represents more of an earthy & spicy hop leaf flavor, much like a Noble hop would. Dense, with a solid, biting bitterness. Lighter, uplifting fruity notes of orange, citrus, & faint gooseberry pile up nicely over the soft background of heavy wheat & some doughy malt. Lingering, ashy leaf bitterness with a very small dash of citrus peel & wheat. First few sips didnt captivate me, but over the course of the can, this one really opened up nicely. At 5.5% this is nice & crushable, too. Very nice hoppy wheat ale that showcases a heavier spicy/ashy"" hop profile than most, but does so nicely.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

1516,"2014-07-19",3.6,"Can: Pour is cloudy lemon gold with a frothy, fine bubbled two finger white head into this glass. It retains on the average side, with some cob web presence. Theres certainly a deficiency in the style out there ; therefore, its a welcome addition to anyones local repertoire, I believe. I cant speak directly for Motueka hops, lacking the brewing experience in it but the distinction is fairly immediate here. Theres a floral note but its earthen, with light tangerine presence and a hint of spice. The flavor profile is more bittering hops than I suppose I expected, and thats ok. It moves to peach, citrus rind, with a mild mannered balancing act from the malt bill. The wheat is feint initially, and that is also ok : their goal was to highlight the hops, and frankly the mouthfeel and bitterness level reminds of Daisy Cutter, which is not a surprise.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

Aroma: The aroma is fruit and wheat, with peach, apricot, tropical fruit, and some lemon

Appearance: It pours a couldy yellow-orange color with a white head and some decent lace

Flavor: The flavor is much the same, wheaty and fruity, with a nice bitterness to it

Palate: The body is medium, it has an average carbonation, and a clean, dry finish

1516,"2014-06-01",3.4,"This is one of those wheat beers that is basically an American Pale Ale brewed w/ wheat. Hey, whatever works. This stuff is pretty tasty. Poured from a can, its quite cloudy in appearance, yellow w/ a foamy head. This is very much a hop-centric brew, grassy and herbal w/ a good bit of melon and citrus as well. There is a slight tea-like astringency which has a drying effect on the tongue. A touch of sweetness emphasizes the fruitiness of the hops and while the nose on this is hardly a knockout on its own, it is still very flavorful. This is a medium bodied beer w/ mild and fine carbonation. For a lighter, hoppy beer, I prefer a bit more spunky carbonation but apparently the folks at Half Acre like it more mild on that note, Id say if you enjoy Half Acres flagship, you will like this quite a lot as well. They are very much cut from the same cloth: pale ales w/ lots of hop flavor that go easy on the bitterness in the finish. This is definitely one where you could pick up a couple four-packs to keep you company on a long summer afternoon.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

The aroma picked up a whole helluva lot of fresh, bright hops (pineapple, ginger, and orange led).. soft red wheat down there, but the hops stole the show.

I like this a bit more than the first time but alas it aint no Gumballhead.  Original rating... Bomber bottle and served in my Ayinger small glass: Hazy golden hue with a nice frothy head and streams of lace. The aroma is quite grassy, herbal and dank with grapefruit esters along with pale malt and a bit of wheat husks. The taste is sharp and acidic at first with a grapefruit rind overtone. The malt is simply there as background noise. Yes, husky and rind dominated... not nearly as refreshing as the Boulevard 80-Acre I had before it.  While the aforementioned Boulevard exceeded expectations this was a case of simplistic bittering and almost a one note approach.

1516,"2012-06-24",3.6,"22 ounce bomber from the brewery.  Im a sucker for good packaging, and the label art on Akari Shogun is especially good.  Normally Im not too thrilled about wheat beers, but this one had a logo that had me sold.  

Im not quite sure how the Asian warrior theme fits in to an American wheat, but after a little wikipedia research, I learned that Akari means ""light"" or ""glimmer"" and shogun, as you may already know from movies and video games, means ""commander of force.""  The ""commander of light force,"" seems an appropriate title for a summer wheat beer, if only it were an Asian wheat beer.  

Which led me to figure out what marks ""American"" wheats from other wheat beers. This required a worldwide tour on worldwideweb. It turns out that American wheats are not too old of a style, having come about in the 1980s.  Theyre characterized as less spicy and phenolic, due to different yeast cultures than their German wheat (wiessbier: Berlin; hefeweizen: Bavaria) brethren.  Akari Shogun, specifically, is a hazed orange, it thoroughly laces the glass, and it puts off a hearty citrus aroma.  It reminded me a lot of the Half Acre staple, Daisy Cutter.  

Akaris taste had lots of pine and lemony hops.  That makes sense, because they used Motueka hops (thats Motueka, New Zealand), which are known as an especially citrusy variety.  Motueka hops are also known to be Saaz-like in flavor, and Saaz hops are a slightly spicy ""noble hop"" from the Czech Republic, often used in Bohemian and Czech pilseners, bringing us full circle back to the German neighborhood.  

Back on topic to Akari, there was a certain hollowness to the taste, and I would have liked it if the mouthfeel, texture and flavor were a little more busty.  I would definitely show up for an imperial version of Akari Shogun. Nonetheless, this stuff is very refreshing and enjoyable, and somewhere in the B+ range.","Illinois, USA","brian60625"
