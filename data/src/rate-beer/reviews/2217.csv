Color is bright peach with a slight bit of copper. Not entirely transparent, though no visible haze particles. Initial head is a single finger and dies down pretty quickly into a bit of foam on top.

Taste is some light biscuit malt and a very mild amount of caramel and toffee. Pretty plain. There are some light earthy and floral characteristics in the background. Light creamy character.

Pours a bright, highly effervescent orange-amber color (perfect color on this, but not surprised from Capital); creamy, fine-bubbled light-tan head with great retention and lacing; really promising pour. Softly toasty maltiness in the nose, very clean, crisp, and focused on that perfectly restrained malt character; dead-on for the style, with maybe just the slightest touch of ethanol. Medium body; lively carbonation; crisp, snappy profile; generally smooth; you really cant ask for a better mouthfeel, with a nicely interjected acidity; lightly creamy, toasty maltiness is again the core of things here; seems like a fair amount of Vienna malt, but Im just guessing here; nicely toasty, well-attenuated, with an appropriate level of mineral hop bitterness there as well; hugely rich in the maltiness for how easy-drinking this is.

2217,"2005-12-26",3.1,"(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with Ughsmash, thanks Jason!) Flavorful, if unspectacular and borderline bizarre Oktoberfest lager with a sweet, toasty, and overly caramely maltiness, a moderately strong bitterness, at least for the style, a strange fruitiness, and a rather unwelcome perfumy flavor as well.  Hops adds a bit of spiciness to the mix.  In the nose, I pick up sweet caramel, brown sugar, an odd earthy/woody aroma, and some kind of fruitiness that occasionally reminds me of raisins, then maybe grapes, but ultimately remains elusive to unwaivering identification.  Medium bodied and sufficiently carbonated, pretty much just feels like Im drinking a generic beer.  Amber color shows nearly perfect clarity ... and precious few carbonation bubbles rising through the beer.

Pours to a filtered glowing deep rusty orange body with a thin wispy white head.  The aroma is wet leaves, maple, light cherry juice, frosting.

Decently-crafted, but not as rich as I had hoped.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

2217,"2005-03-29",3.0,"Bronze in color with a small, off-white, bubbly yet creamy head, which maintains creaminess throughout the sampling, leaving formidable lacing on the glass.  Aroma is sweet and spiced; malty, with characteristics of cedar and musk.  When the beer hits the palate, it tastes slick and stretched out.  Malts are discernable - a mild sweetness from caramel and Munich malts, but less aggressively so because of lighter pilsener malts that have been incorporated.  A mild spiciness hits the back of the tongue, coupled with a grainy tactile presence.  Malt sweetness is doubling back again as it warms, taking on a taste reminiscent of a caramel apple.  Some light tobacco esters and a small trace of alcohol comes through in the last 2 ounces of the remaining brew.  This Oktoberfest is well-balanced in taste, but is not very rich.  Malts and hops are proportional, but I like more of a malt backbone in my Oktoberfests.  Im hoping Capitals Fest can deliver in the areas where this Oktoberfest was less aggressive.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Aroma hinted of apricot, floral hops, caramel, butterscotch, and spicy herbs. The taste started mildly acidic before a smooth malty sweetness appeared. Light spices and biscuit taste followed. A dry and clean finish. This medium-bodied brew has a slighty creamy and lively mouthfeel. While it was not my intention to cellar this bottle (it got lost in the back), it appears to have age gracefully without losing any characteristics I remembered from last year.

Taste is subdued roasted malts with some sweetness and slight tang coming through mostly, a touch of herbal qualities show up near the finish along with a balancing sweetness.
