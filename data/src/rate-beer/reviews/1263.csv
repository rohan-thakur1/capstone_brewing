APPEARANCE: mostly clear, orange amber body (I have the right bottle, but no WAY is this ruby, as the above summary states!) that offers reasonable effervescence... head is off-white, thick, and palpable... lacing forms appropriately,, almost like coral...a good-looking pint... AROMA: no doubt East Kent Golding, with that floral, lavender and lemon... spicy enough to also have Tettnanger or Spaltz... the fruitiness is strong for an ESB.. some clove and thyme work their way in, for a full, pleasing array... PALATE: medium to full-bodied, with a sizzle at the start and a strong, lasting malty finish... active and engaging, some froth too, and unlike many ESBs with lesser character... TASTE: a good, roasted quality sits in the throat, with mild caramel developing an ever-present sweetness that pervades the whole of the experience; the hop profile is decidedly balanced too, though undercut by the malts, with citrus, flower, fruit and earthiness smoothed together in a drinkable blend that begs for pub fare or a game to watch...OVERALL: What must be the ""Harvest"" quality is the label itself--this is a wonderful approximation of the British standard with enough character to set itself slightly apart from the predictable; at 6.7% ABV deceptively sessionable... sweet and smooth--another success from Southern Tier...","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"

1263,"2014-08-08",3.4,"Transfer from BA review on 10-3-12- 
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  Served an amber colored beer with a small white head. The head faded rather fast to leaves a light amount of lacing on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma was of a malty biscuit smell mixed with citrus and pine hops. While these were the dominant aromas there was a lighter caramel sweetness.

 Taste  The hops show up early in this one and create a hopped pine and citrus flavor on top of a lightly sweetened malt base. As the flavor advances more caramel sweetness comes to the tongue with some of the hop flavors growing slightly lighter in intensity. This changes however as the sweetness lessens again more toward the end due to a roasted malt flavor that comes to the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly higher than average side in terms of creaminess with the carbonation level being on the lower side. 

 Overall  Really not the best ESB out there, but not bad either. It has a decent flavor profile with some nice flavors. It is well worth a try if you have the chance.","","Darkmagus82"

Very nice aroma being that of citrusy hops. Maybe even some floral in ther too. Lite malt.

A nice balanced taste with a nice hop bite up front and sweet maltiness up bring up the rear.

This beer was poured into a pint glass.
The appearance was a nice hazy but almost transparent orange to brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipates within less than a minute leaving some decent foamy lacing.
The smell had rich English malts that seem to be slightly roasted in a sense. There is a decent nuttiness coming out as well.
The taste was roasty, malty and nutty with a delicate toasty bready note on the backend. There was no aftertaste but a quick dry finish.
On the palate, it sat about a light to medium in body with a decent sessionable quality to it. The carbonation was fairly smooth which is good for they style and for me.

1263,"2013-09-12",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2014 Bottled August 29, 2013 (2 weeks old).
Appearance: The body is crystal clear with a beautiful copper hue that reminds me of Autumn. The head is tall and dense with good retention, settling into a full dense coating.
Aroma: The aroma is subtle, but caramel is balanced very nicely by orange, grapefruit and floral notes.
Taste: This is beautifully balanced, slightly sweet of caramel, but there are dry toast, floral and grapefruit that blend together providing a mildly bitter and dry presence. The finish lingers only for a moment, semi-dry, with a lingering hint of sweet orange and caramel.
Palate: Medium bodied with soft carbonation.
Overall: The best ESB Ive ever had. This is beautifully balanced with a slight American twist. Its outstanding how well priced this is too, $8.99 for a 6 pack!
Bottled September 4, 2014 (8 days old)
Glass: Weyerbacher tulip.
Appearance: Crystal clear amber body with a short and light tan head. Head looks a bit rough.
Aroma: The aroma hints at caramel and cracker malt with a slightly rubbery and slightly orange aroma with a fresh resinous quality. This isnt the aroma I remember unfortunately.
Taste: Crisp mildly sweet and malty intro with light sweet orange undertones. The overtones are earthy, slightly rubbery, with a mild bitterness. Hops taste resinous and fresh. The finish is a bit piney, a bit resinous, slightly rubbery. Sharp ending, rather dry.
Palate: Crisp and medium bodied.
Overall: Ah man, Im let down this year. This isnt the beer I know and love. This doesnt have the maltiness, nor the big orange aromas and flavors I loved about this in the past. Im comparing notes and theres a lot about this that is similar, but the hop profile seems off this year. Oh well.

Nose is perfect. Citrus spice and hop herbal. Theres a little floral, some yeast and a nice spice. Malt is grainy and deep. Touch of caramel and a doughy sweetness. 

Taste is fat with flavor. Malt is full and rich but not heavy. Citrus lightens the body and the spice is courteous and gives the palate some interest. The sweetness is light but promising. Theres nice hop bitter and a deep earthy dryness that compliment each other perfectly. The sweetness is held back and it seems to want to flourish but the hops and the bread wont let it. Bubbles tickle the back of the throat lightly in the crisp dry finish. The spice tingles int he aftertaste as the citrus stays light and really lets the malt shine. Earthy, round, full malt without heaviness.

1263,"2012-11-19",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2014 (12/2014) This years version is less complex then my original tasting - could be late in its freshness cycle. Nice ale. Mildly aromatic. Pale clear amber. Refreshing crisp bitter on a solid malt body. Some nuance - taste starts with balanced interplay between malt sweet and hop bitter with the bitter winning out in the finish. Still good, just not as dramatic.
(11/2012 - 3.9) Beers like this make me like hops. Nice pour, brief, shallow, off-white head. Warm amber-gold in color - very close to the label color. The Aroma - one of the more complex and pleasing hop aromas I?ve had. The Taste - hop forward, but married to a malt background, very integrated, nicely done.

Unfortunately I didnt get as much as Id like, and the retention wasnt that great either, zero lace. Smooth up front, a bit sweet in the middle, then gives a bit of a punch on the back end, with a mellow aftertaste. Not much body to it, but a little bubbly on the carbonation. Way too much emphasis on all the wrong parts, but I can say the more I drank it the more I liked it.","Wisconsin, USA","frozen_glass"

I guess Ill just call it an American take on the style, but really needs a sweeter malt and smoother hops to come close to being a good ESB.  But as an IPA, its a goodie.  Smooth, subtle, well balance, with a lot of sweet malt riding forward, but its all a bit overpowered by the hops.  Nice, but doesnt live up to the label.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","buzz_and_hum"

The flavor is really amazing. Lots of pine and citrus up front from the hops but it is nicely balanced by caramel and a little bit of roast. These flavors are on the lighter side and are all well balanced. I also pick up just a hint of smoke.

Fruity and hoppy on the nose with caramel, chocolate, pine, cortex and woody hints. Quite nice actually. Surprisingly thin and watery mouthfeel. Thats a bit of a downer, and the carbonation level is soft to flat. Blended flavors with first a bit alcohol, some hops, malts and a fruity sweetness thats keeping it all well balanced.

A little alcohol stings in the finish; not surprisingly since this is fairly true to the style but with considerably more alcohol than most.

1263,"2011-11-01",4.1,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a tumbler.Appearance: Crystal clear, clean, copper color. Forms a good sized, eggshell colored head which retains and laces very well.Smell: Strong hop aroma as soon as the cap is popped. Light flowers, tropical fruits (sans acidity) and a hint of pine needles. Very enticing.Taste: I dont grade beer to style and Southern Tier Harvest is a perfect example of why. This is technically an ESB, yet it looks, smells and tastes much more like a traditional American IPA than an English pub-style bitter. It begins with a swift, sharp bitterness which transitions to a refreshing, tropical fruit juice-like taste and reverts back to bitterness with a strong hop bite. It has aspects of both west and east coast IPAs with the citrusy, juicy flavors (without the citric tartness), and pine needle and toffee-like sweetness. The hops linger momentarily, but otherwise the beer finishes very clean. Satisfying and tasty all around - I cant think of a single flaw with this palate.Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, low carbonation but not tepid; slightly dry aftertaste.Drinkability: Weighing in at 6.7% ABV, Southern Tier Harvest is pretty big for an ESB, but it doesnt sacrifice palatability. The flavor is strong, but not overwhelming (perhaps for beginners, though). The body is crisp, but smooth and strong enough to stand up to food but enjoyable perfectly well on its own.

Aromas of green hops are dominating with some nice floral notes. A hint of sweet malt in the aroma as well. Taste is also hoppy but they taste more like noble hops. A grainy backbone asserts itself rapidly, battling with the hoppy bitterness. Almost no hint of the maltiness I detected on the nose. Instead a delicious spiciness adds a wonderful new element to this ESB. Texture is medium. Medium-high carbonation. Very lively on the tongue. Texture is somewhat oily.

Heavier and rich on the palate as is the norm for ST beers. Huge tannic malt earthiness in conjunction with nutty bitterness. Gets a little cheesy.

Aroma: It has a hoppy nose with some pine, wood, citrus fruits, earth, grass, and caramel

Appearance: It pours a clear red-orange color with a white head that coats the glass in lace

Flavor: It has a nice woodsy, pine, and citrus hop flavor to it with some caramel malts for balance

Palate: The body is medium, with a sticky/piny mouthfeel, nice drinkability, and a dry finish

Overall Impression: 
This is a pretty good beer.  It kind of feels like fall, if that makes any sense...  Anyway, I think this one works really well.  It is highly drinkable, and rather enjoyable, if it were low enough in ABV (and it certainly feels like it is), I would say this is a pretty great autumn session beer.

S- Very Seasonal smelling. Nice mix of hops, with nice spicy smells. A little nutmeg and cinnamon comes to mind. the smell is very light and full of autumn feelings. It brings to mind nice cool breezes and the leaves changing. The hops bring all those out with a very light, yet full bodied smell

T- The hops are so strong flavoured here. The spices also come out very nicely along with some fruity flavours like some Raisins or Dried Cranberries. The floralness of the hops really is reminiscent of Autumn, very crisp and cool in taste. Nice in light on the tongue as well, which compliments the delicate, yet bold flavours of the hops.

There was light caramel malt, light bread and biscuit, lemony, piney hops, some yeast, metallic hops and perfumy hops.

Now, I got this in July (loose bottle rack at Binnys), so this must actually be LAST YEARs Harvest Ale. Thats why I miss the vegetal green hop of a fresher bottle.

1263,"2009-10-04",3.4,"Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle in a pub glass.  The beer pours a light golden color, as opposed to the ""deep ruby"" that was advertised on the bottle.  This isnt the only odd item about this beer.  The nose is very hoppy, resembling an IPA more than an ESB, and pretty much totally outside of the style.  I am all for pushing style limits and being experimental, but this beer resembles a strong and too-hoppy American Pale Ale more than an English pale ale.  The misrepresentation transfers to the palate, as the beer is bracingly bitter, far too much for what is supposed to be a subtle and restrained style.  Additionally, this example doesnt contain nearly the malt character that is needed for the style.  Instead, there is a nice hop flavor in place of malt.  The presence of some crystal malt would definitely serve to improve the beer though.  Overall, this is a good beer, but it is outside of the style to a point that is a detriment.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Oktoberfest is one of my least favorite styles. Now knowing S.T I figured they added some hops to balance it out. What I got was one of the best IPA style beers I have had to date.

Overall: A beautiful example of what an everyday or session brew should be, an absolute repeat, not a favorite, but its not my favorite style either, high value, high craft. This is what Budweiser Ale should strive hard to be. 20 out of 20.","Trenton, New Jersey, USA","lemasney"
1263,"2008-10-17",3.9,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a pint glass

Appearance: It has a bright golden color with a slight chill haze and a small creamy white head. It fades to just a very thin covering that still makes some nice lace on the glass.

Smell: The aroma has a hop filled nose with piney/citrus notes and a hint of caramel and toasted grain.

Taste/Mouth feel: Its flavor has a good malty backbone with light toasted notes as well as a mild almost fruity sweetness. This is balanced by good bitterness from the hops which add some piney/citrus notes. In the finish I picked up more of a herbal tea like hop flavor that slowly fades off the tongue. It has a solid medium body with good carbonation and a slightly slick texture.

Notes: I wasn’t expecting a ESB for a harvest beer but it was very enjoyable.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

Did I mention that I love nutty malt characters?  ’Cuz I do, and this mingles with well with a mild hop build.  Not the most memorable ESB, but a damn fine example.

The flavor was moderately bitter, featuring mild grapefruit, apricot, caramel, and also some lightly toasted bread.

The aroma and appearance are not particularly noteworthy and the flavor is comparable to a slightly hoppier [and lighter] version of Sam Adams [decent - not great].

I should have served this colder. Cellar temp isnt working. This has an awful lot of flavor and complexity for an APA. Nicely dry and quaffable. Spicy on the palate, in a Moroccan way.

1263,"2007-10-26",3.4,"This beer is a bit different than a good number of APAs Ive had.  It isnt a total thick, syrup-y hop-bomb (and I love those...) and it also isnt light and insipid.  And it suprised me...its appearance led me to believe it would be light and flavorless, and it was hoppy and very light and drinkable.

This beer is a light gold color, totally clear, and brilliant.  It looks like a blonde ale from a large brewer might look like, and looks more than a little like a Budweiser or MGD.  Even the head is industrial looking - it is composed of uniformly sized bubbles of a medium size (think the head on a glass of Sprite).  It is a bit fizzy and has limited staying power.  ""Uh-oh,"" I thought.  ""I dont think Im going to like this.""  The beers smell started to change my mind.  Lightly sweet and substantially hoppy with a lot of pineapple and citrus notes.  Flavor was a very light hoppy fruitiness backed with some malt.  It had very pleasant APA flavor and middle-of-the-road intensity.

Fresh, resiny hop aroma: grapefruit and citrus: not even the slightest astringency.  For starters, this beer reminds me so much of Buckeye Amarillo IPA (which is now my baseline of clean hops): clean, orangey and citrus hoppiness throughout; great resins and hop oils, with just enough malt to keep things afloat; just incredibly drinkable and good.

Seems like a mix of noble and American hop varieties. Well attenuated, not that sweet - assertive yet non-harsh bitterness. Medium/light body with a smooth texture and lively carbonation.

Bitter, tight, and simple flavor akin to an unsweetened and oversteeped black tea.  Pungent, old fruit and a burnt toffee sweetness.  Quickly, a thick smoke of wet autumn leaves and grass clippings intrudes and rests heavily.  Certainly flimsy malts.    A fleeting, foul whisper of diacetyl before the finish.  Bitterness with no character, and some sweet corn in the post-script.  Crisp and somewhat light texture doesnt lend a lot of interest.  Earthy, and bitterly herbal.

1263,"2007-09-24",3.0,"Light yellow color with a small head.  I have to take off on appearance because it looks like a light lager.  The smell however is fantastic.  You can smell it from a foot away.  Classic citrusy aroma, very inviting.  Its well balanced PA, but only in that it has a thin body and is moderately bittered to match.  There is big hop flavor though, as promised.  Pine, spruce, spicey, earthy flavor.  I dont pick up any caramel at all, I think this is either straight base malt or maybe just a touch of light crystal.  Has a very dry finish, flavor lingers a while and becomes a little unpleasant.  The idea that this beer is better than 98.5 % of other PAs is a joke.  Its an easy drinking extra pale ale but nothing spectacular.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","theshocker"

Grapefruit explodes onto the nose like few other beers I have experienced.  The aroma is like a freshly sliced ruby red grapefruit over a toasted wheat background, with faint hints of caramel.  The flavor again starts with sharp, bitter grapefruit, followed by drying wheat.  Lightly toasted caramel is present, though its simply a complimentary background flavor and it does not add much sweetness.  Medium-light palate that goes down smooth and finishes with a razor-sharp grapefruit kick.  Ultra-refreshing beer that would be perfect for the beach or poolside on a hot Florida day.

However, thereafter comes a pleasing aroma of bright citrusy and grassy hops above wafery malts. Flavor was light and clean, almost wheaty cereal malts with a decent infusion of hops, leaving some refreshing citrusy bitterness on the finish.  Not as caramely in the malt like almost every other APA, here instead concentrating on the hop side, which is a nice change of pace.  Quite the drinkable light yet hoppy session beer.

Lots of flavor notes in here. Sweet pastries lead in, followed by some sort of exotic sugar, and tapers off with grass/herb notes. Very complex for an APA.

1263,"2007-08-26",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 27, 2007 Color is completely lucid pale, reaching into macro-looking territory. Just some spit in place of lacing, not nice looking.  Aroma is awesome though, I dont know how they did it but its strong on hops but they are not assertive on your nose.  First comes citrus and lightly resin-y hops, then some floral/grassy German-like hoppiness and just a hint of sweet light-summer honey.  Not aggressive, more of a misty feeling to the aroma.  Taste is soooo light and yet full of flavor, more on the floral/grassy side with a good strong carbonation and felt bitterness to round it all off.  Light and refreshing and definitely has a hoppy Pilsner (or very light Maibock) feel.  Aftertaste is lightly white bread sweet with lingering grassiness.

In many Southern Tier I have found the malt profile to be too hard and clean, but in this beer the mouthfeel is a little more rounded and the crispness feels more appropriate.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"

IIPA Rating: 9/2/2004 Total Score: 3.9Pour is an amber orange with a little bit of a white film on top that quickly receeds to the outside edge of the glass.  The aroma is mild hops.  Very clean tasting, very refreshing.  I should have bought about a case of this.  Great stuff.

IIPA Rating: Consumed 2008, almost 4 years old. Kept at cellar temps since its purchase in fall 2004. The top comes off with only a slight hiss. The pour is a hazy melon/gold with a thin head of white cream. The aroma has dulled but the hops are still detectable. There is a spicy hoppiness and almost a candy fruitiness. The flavor is definitely sweeter, but still really nice. Fruity, malty, and just a touch of spiciness. Good stuff for a brewery that was just getting started at the time. 6/3/6/3/14. 

2006 version. Pale yellow color with white creamy head. Aroma is different. Almost soapy smelling with some dried out dusty hops. Flavor is bitter hoppiness with a bone scrapping dryness to the finish. This was hugely dissapointing. Nothing like last years version. 6/3/5/3/14

2007 Version 12oz bottle fresh. Pour is a clear pale orange with minimal head.  Aroma is a pleasant fresh hops that is very fragrant.  The flavor is clean and crisp, very easy to drink.  The malts and hops play with each other very nicely.  This has VASTLY improved over last year. Congrats to Southern Tier - back on track. 7/3/8/4/17

2008 version. On Tap at the Flour City Beer Festival. The man pouring said it was only newly available a few days before.  Very fresh hop aroma that just bulldozes its way through my sinuses.  Really nice to smell.  The flavors reveal some of the other characters like pine and a touch of orange.  Very easy to drink and exciting all at the same time.  Its definitely at its best when as fresh as possible. 8/4/8/3/18

2009 version. Light bodied and grassy, citric hops. Drink fresh and drink often.

Poured from the bottle a slighty cloudy golden amber with thin head. I liked the piney hop aroma, that made my hop senses tingle. The flavor was a bit odd, the hops seemed to be at the end leaving a different dry bitterness which isnt usually a bad thing. i think this was missing a little malty sweetness to balance the bitterness a bit.

Hoppy aromas, earthy spicy, grapefruity and leafy, hints of pine and a very soft sweet malty way in the background.

A good moderate carbonation and a crisp, smooth lightish medium bodied mouthfeel.

Hoppy tasting with the hops soft in their bitterness, grapefruit, more zest than rind, an earthy pepperiness, hop leafy, the malts are subdued, sweet with touches of grain, and a spicy and leafy finish.

Not a bad fall APA, the hoppiness is soft enough to keep this from being an IPA, I personally could have use a touch more of a malt backbone, more malty flavor, but still very drinkability.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"

1263,"2004-11-13",3.1,"UPDATED: NOV 14, 2004 (12 oz bottle, obtained in trade with shadey, thanks Shane!) Not bad, not bad.  But not great either.  Its fairly flavorful, moderately hoppy with grapefruit overtones, and malty enough to somewhat balance the hops.  Neither of the components assert themselves.  This pale ale also has a sweet orange citrus flavor which starts off slowly, but comes on a bit stronger in the finish.  And as this beer warms to room temperature, a clear sweetness emerges, mostly in the finish.  Medium bodied, somewhat crisp from the hops, but not especially dry either.  I dont get too much in the way of aroma with this beer -- its vaguely malty, a bit hoppy, but pretty light overall.  The color is light amber, a bit hazy, with many medium-size carbonation bubbles hurrying their way to the top of the beer.  Pours to about half an inch of off-white colored head, somewhat creamy, with solid retention.  A dense curtain of lace is left on the glass.  This Southern Tier product is enjoyable enough, but not in the upper tier.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

1263,"2004-11-07",4.3,"Wow...! Where the hell did this brewery come from? Ive been drinking micro-brewed beers for about a year and a half now, and I only came across this lovely variety pack just a couple of days ago. I am VERY impressed with these beers, especially this one. My bottle says phin and matts extraordinary ale...and that it definately is. This is a very clean, crisp, unique ale that I found ver enjoyable. Could easily have a LONG session with this stuff. This is a damn fine brew plain and simple. Im not going to get all technical about the aspects of aroma and flavor, just go out and get yourself a case of this...youll thank me. Its about 30 bucks.
cheers!","womelsdorf, Pennsylvania, USA","alehead"
1263,"2004-11-05",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2011 Every once in awhile, life treats us to a surprise.  And every once in awhile, those surprises exceed even our wildest expectations.  I bought this case of Southern Tier beers from Shangys because it was affordably priced, had a variety of 4 beers I had never tried, and I liked the labels.  The IPA has already knocked me out, and this one just goes over the top!  Again, my label is more modernized than the photo at left.  Pours slightly turbid gold with a medium white head and average lacing.  Gigantic aroma of hops, citrus, malt, pine, resin.  Tastes super hoppy, with a firm malt backbone and a crsip, smooth, piney finish, even a touch of Tanqueray gin.  I have two more Souther Tier beers to try from my variety case.  These beers destroy ass!  I know where two more cases are, and Ill be getting them tomorrow before anyone else hears about this.  This secret wont stay secret for long.

Re-rate 11-Oct-2011,, almost 7 years later.  Wow, this was one of my first 1,000 ratings!  How time flies.  Anyway, Im kicking this one down a few notches, as I had it again this weekend, and although I still love this beer, it is not a 4.6 beer, especially looking at my rating history.  I chalk this re-rate up to normalizing a very good beer that I initially rated too high due to childhood exuberance.  Still, a worthy harvest ale well worht the price and seeking out.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

1263,"2004-10-25",3.7,"A very pleasant fall pale ale.  Full orange color - clear; medium head that settles to a short ring, great lacing.  Aroma is fresh citrus, herbal hops, wet malts.  Medium bodied - the flavors feel like theyre coating the entire mouth with sweet malts, orange peel, mellow grapefruit, apricots, and some herbal, almost medicinal hops.  For all of the hoppyness going on, theres still a big blast of malt to keep it even keeled.  Thanks for bringing this to me, Rudy!","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
1263,"2004-10-23",3.5,"A nice balance beween lightly sweet caramel malt and fresh hops in the aroma. Pours a glowing orange with a nice white head.

1263,"2004-10-20",3.9,"My bottle poured an orangey colour that looked just like autumn. The nose was a sensational hop bouquet with pine, spice and citrus. The flavour didnt quite live up to that initial promise, but I still enjoyed the nice initial hop kick followed by a solid malty flavour.","Whitby, CANADA","mustang3"
1263,"2004-10-18",3.4,"Bottle:  Light, clear, copper in color with a solid, off white head.  Very fresh aroma.  Citrus & floral hops, lemon, orange, candy sugar, bubble gum, and a nice earthyness round out the aroma.  Sticky taste, quite fresh and balanced taste.  Initially a bit sweet, though quickly afterwards the hops take over.  There some nice orange/citrus flavors here, reminds me of drinking dark, bitter tea - like when you leave the teabag in too long.  That bitterness works well with the juicy hops and solid malt backbone.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"
1263,"2004-10-14",3.6,"Hazy copper. Firm off-white 1cm head. Interesting hop dominated aroma with underlying earthy and cookie-ish malt. Hops come in orangey and rather floral. It has pretty much everything for me to enjoy it, tastes very fresh. Perhaps just a tad too bitter/tart for my tastes. Still, nice overall  balance I must admit, but I kept thinking (dreaming) of sierra nevadas version Ive had recently and it would annihilate this otherwise very fine example. STs example has a good classic highly carbonated medium mouthfeel, but it doesnt have the multiple layers of silkiness that sierra nevada has.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1263,"2004-09-22",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2005 Buffalo Brewfest 04.  This was my beer of the festival.  I thought this had a very unique ""fresh"" taste, even before the above description told me to think that.  Classic orange pour, strong floral hop aroma. Very strong fresh malt and hop taste.  The fruity hops are balanced well with the rest of the beer.  Fantastic, although my original review was infuenced by a day full of samples for sure.  I have since had this in a bottle and I still really enjoy it, it just isnt a 4.7 in my books, which I originally drunkenly rated it.  Nice beer though.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"

1263,"2004-03-05",3.6,"With warm weather approaching (~75 today in Oxford) and leaving (highs in the 40s Saturday), the beer mood shifts from stouts, porters, and belgians to american pale ales and wheat beers.  This pale ale hits the spot.  Pours a clear amber orange with a thin off-white head.  Nice, classic APA aroma with grassy, earthy, floral hops.  These are abundant in the flavor as well, and the biscuity malt body provides just the right amount of balance.  There is a hint of lemon too.  Finishes with a piney bitterness.  A clean, solid APA that doesn't push too many boundaries but definitely satisfies.  Thanks Dan (jah noth)!","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
1263,"2004-02-05",3.6,"Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy dark yellow. Aroma is moderately malty (cookie, bread),
moderately hoppy (herbs, grass, flowers, lemon). Flavor is moderately
sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet,
moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texture,
lively carbonation, lightly astringent. Pretty nice brisk pale ale (kind
of an American/English hybrid).  Tartness is assertive in the finish but
brisk and fairly gentle compared to most APAs...again, I get the
impression this is a British ESB / American PA cross. I like the hop
aroma, it's strong but NOT the usual grapefruit/pine/resin attack...EKG
mixed with something else?  Interesting and enjoyable beer.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1263,"2004-01-08",3.7,"Copper hue with okay head and good lacing. The aroma hints of pine, grapefruit, lemon, toasted caramel malts, buttery biscuits, and hayfields. The taste is hoppy for sure, lots of pine and grapefruit. There is a solid malt base to balance this brew, nice. The bitterness lingers on and on. The mouthfeel is good and a bit chewy. A very good ale and worth seeking out.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Good beige head that lasts, lot of lacing, nice aroma of hops, lots of caramel malt and a good amount of alcohol.  Begins very malty, with lots of medium bitter hops background.  Texture is great, slightly carbonated, caramel malt lingers and turns into a butter toffee.  Finish is creamy and over fairly quick.  Not as good as some other harvests, but the balance is definitely there.  Flavor is true, just could use a bit more depth of hops profile.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1263,"2003-10-15",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 22, 2004 Pours a transparent dark blonde/orange with a 1.5cm small bubbly white head. Aroma is spicy, maybe some cinnamon with a small yeastly hint.  This beer is very hoppy from start to finish.  There are mild notes of spice in there that make it somewhat interesting and the start is a little more mild. I mean, I dont see what makes this a harvest ale really.  Its more like an APA.----Re-rate---I had this again, and I must admit this is a very well-balanced beer that is very enjoyable.  I was sort of shocked when I first had this beer because it was so hoppy and I was expecting a maltier maarzen or something for a ""harvest"" ale.  Now that I'm past that shock, this is more decent than I remember.  I have decreased the aroma from a 7 to a 6, increased flavor from 5 to a 7, increased palate to a 4 from a 3 and increased overall to 14 from a 12.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
