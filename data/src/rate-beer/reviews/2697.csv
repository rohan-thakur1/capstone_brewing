2697,"2013-02-26",3.7,"750 ml bottle from MeadMe. Thanks, Greg! Oscars Night - CCB Rate #98. Pours a richer deep blackish hue, touches of midnight ruby, lighter copper brown edge shows just a touch of light. Dark and opaque body has some firmer thickness, loose brownish head dies to a frothy small filmy layer, laces ok. Aromas are a melange of aromas, showing cocoa and toffee, piney and floral hops, kiss of citrus, bigger resiny dryness, firmer cedar wood, gentle spice and firm stronger dryness hits the nose. Cocoa, some gentle coffee, and toasty malts. Some grapefruit, lemon, more florals and pine meet those dark roasty, sticky malts. Initial is fuller bodied, a bit thicker on the palate with toast, pine and florals. Grapefruit, sticky caramel, cocoa, and biscuits. A nice dryness, mellow coffee, and cedar wood spice dries this up a bit. Coffee and cocoa elements into the middle, dry and roasty elements come on. Grapefruit, florals, pine dry out more into the backend past some of that sticky malt thicker middle. Toasty and roasty, dry hop presence, biscuits and cocoa, black malts. This comes together well, though it certainly is bigger in body. Toasty, roasty, dry finish is pleasant. Florals and pine are medium, touches of grapefruit, dry cedar elements. Its not a big hop presence, a touch deadened, but the dryness, cedar, and hop profile give a firm oomph of dryness, bitterness into that backend and really throughout. A bit stronger as it warms. Really comes together for me despite being a bit big. An Imperial Black IPA seemingly. Solid beer here.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2697,"2013-02-24",4.0,"Pours dark brown color with tan head. Citrus and moderately roasted malt aromas with hints of cedar. Spicy cedar flavor with roasted malts and some citrus hops. Medium body with average carbonation. Good stuff.","Winter Springs, Florida, USA","smith4498"
2697,"2013-02-22",4.3,"Pours black with a creamy light brown head. Huge nose on this. Pine, grassiness, and grapefruit galore with a dry roasted hint. Creamy thick mouthfeel. Sharp pine bite up front leads to a roasted grain finish and a lingering cocoa on thr palate. Dry finish that I am guessing is the cedar. Bit of sweetness well balanced by the bitter. One of the more complex flavor progiles I have had. This is really really good. Curious is age would mellow the hops and turn this into a chocolatey imperial porter.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"
2697,"2013-02-22",4.0,"1 pint+9.4oz bottle. Beautiful pour that looks like a thick stout with sticky lacing.  This beer is thick and delicious. I have never had an American black ale this good. Aroma is interesting,  don?t know if I?d call it smokey, maybe roasted malts. Sweet start bitter finish.  Almost stouty. Great beer.","Florida, USA","beastmaster"
2697,"2013-02-22",3.1,"Pours thick and dark like a stout. Nose is sweet tobacco with a little citrus. Taste is very spicy -- wood, cigar, smoke, followed by sour citrus, then a lingering dry, spicy aftertaste. Admire the craft, didnt love the taste.","Nashua, New Hampshire, USA","VALIS"
2697,"2013-02-20",3.7,"Snifter pour at CCB, poured a dark black color with aromas of cedar, roast, light earth, and a touch of anise.  Flavors are roasted malt with a ton of cedar.  Light bitterness in the aftertaste and the cedar was more dominate as the beer warms.","Florida, USA","burg326"
2697,"2013-02-15",4.2,"Pours a thick black with a dark ominous  head. Lots if cedar in the nose, big hops and some roasted notes. Nice medium body thickness, chocolate, roasted grains, citrus hops in the taste. Nice lingering bitterness in the finish. Really good.

2697,"2013-02-13",3.9,"Dark black pour out of the bottle. Tan head with big bubbles that lace and stick. Smells hoppy with some dark malts and a bit of the woody character.  Taste caught me guard. Sweet, smoky from the cedar, and some bitterness from the hop/roasted malts. Comes together nice. Pretty silky. Vanilla notes in there too. Faint coffee.","Buffalo, New York, USA","Miked1687"
2697,"2013-02-09",4.2,"Pours a rich black umber color with a nice tan sticky foam... Aromas are sweet citrus and pine hop notes mingling with roasted chocolate malts and earthy woodsy spice. The palate is phenomena. Great sweet cedar spice powers through the deep dark fruit, juicy hops and chocolate creaminess to make a complex layer of flavors that meld together nicely !","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
2697,"2013-02-09",3.6,"750ml bottle from Proof.  Black-brown pour with medium tan head and a little lacing.  Aroma is cedar, orange, burnt malt, cocoa.  Creamy palate is the first thing I noticed - strange syrupy and rich.  Tastes are molasses, light smoke, coffee, sweet chocolate, vanilla, wood, citrus, soy.  Catch more of the black ipa in the finish - charred vibe.  Strange brew.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DialSquare"
2697,"2013-02-06",4.0,"750 ml bottle via trade with smith4498 - Pours a dark brown color with a one finger thick tan head.  Very light spotty lacing.  Aroma is pine and resin hops and a bit of roasted malt.  Flavor is pine hops, chocolate, dark esters, and cedar.  Full body.  I love these Humidor Series beers.  The cedar spiciness makes the beer.  Thanks Jason.","BFE, Arizona, USA","cbkschubert"
2697,"2013-01-31",4.4,"Smooth black ale. Very smooth. Super smooth. Incredibly smooth. Pours black. On the tongue, roasted malts, with slight hoppy bitterness, and a complex, unending sweetness that I can't pinpoint. To say it hides its ABV is an understatement -- if I had to guess, I'd wager 5-6% and not 11%. Good good stuff.

Nose is big roast, some spicy cedar, some dark chocolate, some ash, some earth, and some black burnt coffee. Flavor is similar with roasted malts, big earthy black coffee, some ash, some dark chocolate, and spicy cedar.

2697,"2013-01-26",4.2,"On tap at the Winter Warmer 2012, this pours almost opaque black into the glass, with a frothy tan head that leaves suds lacing. The nose is gorgeous; earth, sours, tobacco, hay, silage and grains. Flavors are spot on as well; malt, grains, sour barnyard... Nice! Full bodied and alive on the palate with complexities. Great job on this!!

2697,"2013-01-17",3.8,"1/18/13. 750mL bottle from Grassroots Natural Market. Rich black pour with a nice tan head. Looking through ratings, its obvious who was told smoke and who drank blind/unknowing. Rich, sweet aroma with lots of hops, almost black IPA territory, with wood, cherries, and what could be perceived as sweet barbecue. Maybe. Rich, sweet flavor as well with a ton of hop - citrus, dank, and more - on top of cherry, ash, and lingering sweet, dark fruits. Its like a black IPA on misspelled steroids. Maybe youve heard of me? Im top on BA.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

2697,"2013-01-17",3.4,"Pours jet black with a dark mocha head. Aroma of cedar and that's all, it's pretty forward in this one. Taste is cedar and roast, slight sweetness. It's like a thin humidor Zhukov.

2697,"2013-01-14",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2013 Bottle from the brewery, pours pitch black with medium sized mocha head, lots of different sized bubbles. Body is very full with a syrupy mouth feel. Good amount of lace. Aroma is unbelievable, so much grapefruit rind and blood orange when swirled, smaller notes of cocoa powder, burnt malt, perfume, blackberry and cedar.  Taste was on the rich side compared to the fruity hop aroma...notes were smoked wood, cigars, molasses, bitter coffee and chocolate.  Finish is warming in the chest which should be expected at 11%. Nice American Strong from Cigar city.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"

2697,"2013-01-09",3.1,"Thanks Scott! Pitch black pour dark khaki head. Ceder wood spice pine roasted malts. pine and ceder followed by roasted malts. Finished with a roasted medicinal astringency that I picked but others disagreed. Theres something about roasted beers with thin body that I dont like. This beer is better than my rating but I just cant get over the medicinal astringency.","Sarasota, Florida, USA","stevencon"
2697,"2013-01-09",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 10, 2013 Thanks to Scott! Almost black pour with a creamy tan head that fades to a ring. Gigantic piney hops, cedar and roasted malts with hints of coffee. Slightly creamy entry with roasted malts, cocoa and then more piney, hints of spicy hops. Maybe cedar is making it taste like that? Medium full bodied with light notes of astringency.
