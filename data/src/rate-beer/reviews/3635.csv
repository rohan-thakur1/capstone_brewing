3635,"2016-06-22",3.5,"2016-05-20. Crisp orange body small beige head and nice lacing. 3+ Aroma is relatively mild, lightly citrusy hops, grassy hops, lightly toasty malt. Flavour is moderately bitter, some nice fruity hop character, light citrus, lightly astringent finish. Smooth average to light bodied palate, low carbonation. Decent. 7/4/7/3/14 On cask at The Brewery, Christchurch, NZ.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
3635,"2014-11-11",3.6,"Restrained aroma followed by a full bodied, malt forward, flavour that makes a nice contrast to the more hop forward takes on the style.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
3635,"2014-02-07",3.6,"The head is medium, the body gold-brown, a bit cloudy. It smells hoppy, bitter, aromatic. The taste is hop-aromatic, bitter, bit dry, intensive malty, fruity, bitter aromatic, ok. 3.6","Otorohanga, NEW ZEALAND","kiwianer"
3635,"2014-01-24",3.4,"Ha! The 10th rating. My rating will trigger the average. Great to exercise power in such a passive way. Anyway, this is a lovely copper/amber with a très crémeux head, aroma and flavour full of fruits and butterscotch, nicely balanced with a fruity bitterness, but all very subtle. The big problem is that its Milk Stout sister is more seuctive, so theres less opportunities for more pints of this nice beer.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"
3635,"2013-08-13",4.0,"Draft at CBD. Hazy variegated golden amber color, thick creamy white head with good retention and solid lacing. Aroma of summer fruit and subtle white pepper. Taste is creamy bread dough, stone fruit, light citrus, black pepper. Complex and characterful.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3635,"2013-07-12",3.3,"Pint pulled from the han pump at cassells. Pours hazy bright copper with a thin but creamy bone white head. On the nose there is faint hopping with some pale malts. Nice thick mouthfeel with some fruity hops, not much bitterness and a nice sweet malty taste.","NEW ZEALAND","petergaynor"
3635,"2013-06-11",4.0,"A sweet and slightly citrus aroma english ale with a creamy head. Has a nice balanced mouthfeel and lingering bitter finish. Ill be back to try Cassels other offerings","","ckelly"
3635,"2013-04-23",2.9,"a standard bitter. the bitterness does last quite a while, which is nice, but else its a typical session beer. a little muted fruit, smooth, deep maltiness; quite nice i suppose.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","lisagirl"
3635,"2013-03-22",4.7,"Like milk, it becomes, so it goes. Its a staple. Its the yardstick. Its where the palate returns to a reference. And bears burden well - everything is contained. A beginning, middle and end. Impressions of malt, relationship with hop and afterthoughts of dry sherry and quince, quenching and sated.","NEW ZEALAND","horotane"

Aroma: Honey, understated.
Palate: Soft, gentle mouth feel.
Flavor: Honey, soft, smooth malt
Comments:  On the mild side.  The English Mild Stout was recommended over this.  Pleasant but doesnt stand out.","Kobe, JAPAN","Wombata"

3635,"2011-11-21",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2013 A lovely rosy brown amber pint with a white head that dissipates and clings to the sides of the glass. Spicy, woody notes pervade the aromas and flavours and a good lengthy, satisfying bitterness. Im a little bit unfair to this beer because there are always so many other good offerings on at Cassels that I never get around to serving it justice: so not my first choice beer, but just about anywhere else it would be.

I think this beer is well overdue for a re-rate, especially in my view that it has gone from strength to strength and become my go-to beer when I walk into The Brewery. Saying that, it has not deviated too much from its original hallmark colours and flavours but some undefinable zymurgy magic has made this beer seem fuller, silky and juicier. Im base over apex for Best Bitter and am delighted it has reached maturity.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
