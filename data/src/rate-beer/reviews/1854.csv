1854,"2013-08-11",4.8,"Draft in Strassgiech (and again at the beer fest in Nuernberg).

Head is initially large, frothy, white, fully lasting.
Body is hazy medium yellow.

Aroma is moderately malty (sugar cookie), moderately hoppy (apricot, flowers, herbs), with strong notes of pineapple, honey, gum, banana, mango.

Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, silky texture, soft carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

Absolutely insane aroma that made my jaw drop every time I went back in for a sniff. And super succulent in the mouth. Its almost unthinkable that a pale bock could ever get better than this, but Ill leave a little room if only for one thats slightly less sweet (or more bitter, whatever). At the fest in Nuernberg, it occurred to me that the Kellerbier would be a great blending beer with this, adding some earthy notes (and ruby tones) and helping to balance the sweetness for higher quaffability...so if you ever luck into having both available on tap, try a blend and see what you think. Just for fun, mind you...not for anything lacking in this one as-is. Untouchable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1854,"2013-07-06",3.6,"Tapped(@Drei Kronen Straßgiech in the beergarden):Almost clear, golden to deep golden, herbal-hoppy nose, bready traces detectable in the solid bisquity-honeyish background; solid sweet-bitter flavour, soft MF, almost full bodied; lingering herbal-hoppy and fruity finish with a bisquity counterpart. The right stuff","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"
1854,"2013-06-15",4.6,"draft at Zoiglstube Ganstaller in Strassgiech across multiple visits, and On tap at the Frankisch Bierfest Nurnberg 2013. 
Hazy pale golden wheat body with a fine white head. Pineapple / banana / tropical fruit hop-focused aroma with malty accents of sweet honey-drizzled pillowy pastries.  Yeast is subtly rich and provides good lushness and creaminess (along with the superbly soft carbonation). Sticky pale malt and yeast phenols combine to form a pineapple dandelion and lemon oil bouquet. Sweet but never overbearing. Exceptionally soft, rich and creamy malt texture with a satisfyingly sharp bounce in the finish - crisp, smacking, quenching.  Overall a wonderful heller bock that is stacked with complexity.  It was a joy to drink this again at the Zoiglstube and then again a week later in Nuremberg - for an entire day.  Suits the Kellerbier well for blending.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

1854,"2013-05-04",3.7,"Tap (HBF2013, Saturday) - at 8.1%
Vanilla ice cream aroma, floral. Fruity body, nice bitterness. Super mellow. Beautifully attenuated. Crisp palate, sweetish, but not sticky. Quite heady retronasals. Very complex. Theres some scolded milk in the palate. Floral aspects grow as it warms in the aroma. Pungent whole-flower hops too - great. No sign of 8.1% at all. Late finish is dry and bitter, but soft. This is so freaking soft and mellow - wow!","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
