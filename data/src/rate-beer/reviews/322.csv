322,"2016-10-27",3.3,"From notes. Enjoyed at Corbets house during a tasting on October 24. 22 oz bottle. The pour is a lighter coppery gold color with a thicker white head that slowly recedes. The aroma is tropical fruits, a little piney bitterness, and a strong biscuit malt. This isnt my jam. There is a dank citrus here, but the maltiness of this isnt for me. The flavor is a little better. The malt fades a touch, and the citrus really comes through. I like that much of it. The tropical fruits are present, and there is a pretty good bitterness on the back end that seems like it could be associated to the malts. The mouth feel is a little thick and heavy with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly sweet malty candy on the finish. Not my jam.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
322,"2016-07-03",3.5,"Holy crap this beer dropped off quickly. From talking to the person who traded for it, its one month old. Aromas are slightly tropical with a big west coast grapefruit vibe. Kind of overly bitter and slightly old hops, slight caramel. Big letdown.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Art"
322,"2016-06-29",3.5,"Yowza. Aroma is much like Sip, sweet, tropical fruit, pine, and malt. Appearance is amber copper, light tan head. Taste is tropical fruit, lots of it, pine, slight dankness, a candy sweetness, and caramel malt, super weird and complex. Mouthfeel is medium body, light crisp carbonation, juicy candy aftertaste. Overall, Im pretty disappointed by this beer, for the hype it receives.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
322,"2016-05-12",3.4,"Bottle from Jeremy -- cheers! I had been looking forward to this one for a while, and I was amazed at how underwhelming it was when I tried it. If the normal Sip of Sunshine is complex layers of hops on a bitter and sweet base, this was just an overly sweet, supremely yeasty mess. It wasnt particularly hoppy and it tasted like some of the less successful homebrew projects Ive tasted over the years. Hopefully this was an off batch or something.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

322,"2016-04-22",3.0,"Bottle. One of the biggest letdown beers Ive ever had. Over-hyped and not nearly worth what I had to give up to acquire this in a trade. Pours gold/orange, mostly clear, small sudsy white head. Aroma was decent and hoppy, slight pine and citrus notes. Flavor was a mess. Tasted like rotting vegetables, butter, and really earthy. I asked my friend what he tasted and he replied with one word ""anger"". I got a good laugh there. Medium body, sticky texture, bubbly carbonation, really bitter finish. This was my number one want beer and Ive been trying to track it down for quite some time. I finally do and its not even close to good. Either that, or I hyped it up too much or got a bad and skunked bottle. Neither of us got any tropical fruit or citrus in the flavor at all.","Jamestown, New York, USA","bigda83"

Superb hoppy aroma with tropical fruits and a slight floral note. Fantastic aroma, although it has more of an IPA character to me than an Imperial IPA, I would have loved a little pine and resin in there. Nontheless abdolutely lovely. Tastes light to moderately malty, again loads of hops dominating the initial flavor, fortunately some resin amidst the tropical fruit hops.

322,"2015-12-10",4.1,"Bottle (purchased two weeks ago tomorrow and kept cold since purchasing the warm bottle at Hunger Mountain). Pours a hazy orange with an ample, fluffy white head. Lots of messy lacing coats the glass, as I am three-fourths of the way through. Aromas of citrus and tropical fruit, some dank notes; bubble gum after it has warmed a bit and the head has dissipated. Moderately sweet up front balanced by a moderate bitterness that takes over mid-palate and builds. Love the balance. Would like it to taste juicier, though. Medium to medium+ bodied; soft carbonation; moderately bitter finish. Ive had better (and fresher) bottles of this beer and remember being blown away.

322,"2015-11-13",4.2,"Bomber bought at Winooski Beverage Warehouse.
This was poured into a Lawsons tulip.
The appearance was a hazy burnt orange almost brown color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that concaved gracefully to leave some bubbles inside of a thin white cap.
The smell starts off with a sweet onion up front and then some light tropical fruits and a delicate sweet and bitter sprucy piney stickiness.
The taste was mainly bitter backed up by a light sweet tropical fruit revolving around the pine. Bitter sticky piney-ness leading into the aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a good sipping quality and a danky sweet stickiness clinging to my tongue. Some slight hop oils lay down to want to allow a certain slick feel, but still indicates a well balanced oily to slick and clinginess on my tongue.
Overall, what a wonderful DIPA that I know I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

322,"2014-04-29",4.1,"Crushed with Jakebra
Pours a hazy yellow with a medium but well retained head. 

The aroma is grassy & fruity, hop forward all around... dank at moments but basically very pungent, bright & inviting. 

The flavor is well rounded, the first thing that strikes me is how well integrated the bitterness is here, its on the lower end for the style but its just right on as far as giving the beer just the right bitter kick to be satisfying while letting the hop flavors do most of the talking. Its fruity and grassy with a good bright character throughout. There is a touch of booziness, but it drinks far more like a 6% abv beer. Everything is nicely balanced hop flavor wise while this one keeps it real low on malt character. 


This is a great example of how good the Double IPA style can be when its stripped off all the silly bravado that seems to come with the style so frequently.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

322,"2013-10-01",4.8,"Bottle from most recent Coop release poured into Lawsons snifter 8/23/13. Bottle is 1 week old based on when it was purchased. 

A- Pours a cloudy orange hue with a two inch fluffy white head. Medium to high carbonation is visible. Excellent retention and lacing. Over a few minutes, the head fades down to a quarter inch plug over the beer. 

S- Big dank hops followed by a blast of grapefruit, mango, and a little spicy note as well. Very small caramel malt aroma that is all but covered up by the tropical fruit and piney hop character. 

T- The initial sip before you swallow makes it seem like the beer will be a lot more tame than it really is. An absolute blast of grapefruit and pine intertwined with mango, orange zest, and an intense bitter note that leaves you wanting more of the beginning sip. 

M- The carbonation is medium at best, and overall the body is right in the middle of the road. This beer finishes extremely dry, accentuating the bitter notes and making it go down way too easy. I could drink a pint of this in a few minutes without even realizing where it had gone. There is a slight indication of the alcohol, but it is forgotten by the huge aroma and flavor this beer throws at you. 

O- Not my first time having this gem, and hopefully not my last either. An absolute treat to drink- definitely in my top 5 DIPAS, behind HF S&S 5 and 6, although this is solidly more drinkable than either Heady Topper or Pliny. A hopheads paradise.","","justforrazors"

22 oz bottle served in a Lawsons snifter. Bottle a few days before imbibing. Huge thanks to kevanb for the share.

A: Pours a yellowish orange color with a slight chilled haze to it. One finger of white foam forms on the pour and recedes to a thin cap. Soapy lace is left down the glass.

S: Tons of citrus fruit on the nose. Hefty amounts of grapefruit with a mild tangerine/orange citrus sweetness. Minimal biscuit malt in the background as this is all about the hops.

T: The taste is even better and much balanced. A ton of grapefruit with fruity and earthy tone to it. Pineapple and mango tropical fruits with a sweet biscuit malt body to give it a little tangent amongst the heavy fruit brightness. Light bitterness rounds it out.

M: Light bodied with a medium carbonation level. This drinks like a single IPA/Pale ale with the flavor of a big DIPA. Huge drinkability.

O: Dangerously drinkable with a great representation of grapefruit. Probably the best Ive ever tasted or smelt in a beer. Absolutely delicious and incredibly balanced. Hopefully Ill get to try this again sometime.

322,"2013-08-23",4.3,"I poured a 16.375oz bottle into a mug (which, if you look closely, says ""Sunshine Fair"" on it). There was no freshness date on the bottle, though I got this from a friend (thanks, Jon!) who bought it at the brewery for $9 ($0.55 per ounce).

Appearance: Bright golden/yellow hue - almost glowing with intensity. Fairly hazy, but carbonation still visible. Forms a large, ivory, frothy head which laces and retains quite well.

Smell: Strong tropical fruit notes, especially grapefruit, pineapple and passion fruit. Theres a distinct herbal aroma as well - almost garlicky.

Taste: I recently noted that the ""New England Style"" IPA seems to be catching on and this is yet another beer exemplifying some of the great brewing thats taking place in the northeast section of America. Much like a West Coast IPA, Lawsons Finest Double Sunshine IPA has a lot of citrus and stone fruit notes, but ends much differently with a distinct herbal and spicy flavor. Its repetitive and simplistic, but its tasty and thats what matters.

The hops are definitely in control of the palette here. They start out with an almost nectar-like sensation of tropical fruit juice concentrate. Its sweet like a glass of breakfast juice, but at the same time still dank and bitter. At the crest of the swig the bitterness increases exponentially, imparting rustic, herbal and spicy flavors. Ground up tree bark plus garlic and herbal tea. Its dry, but not completely arid. Theres additional fruit flavors on the finish, though there isnt a lot of distinct malt character per se. The hops linger, leaving an aftertaste akin to garlic bread. Usually, I really enjoy this combination, but its a little too spicy for me to give it my highest rating. 

Drinkability: Though Lawsons Finest Double Sunshine IPA is packed with flavor, its not a difficult beer to drink. The mouthfeel is intense with taste, but not carbonation. The mouthfeel is fairly soft and it goes down smooth. There is a drying sensation that lingers, but its highly tolerable. I do notice a bit of warmth from the 8% ABV. It works with the bitterness for the most part, and I would not consider it distracting. A fine double IPA to enjoy on its own because of its rarity and price (though if it were readily available and reasonably priced, itd be perfect with a spicy meal).","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

The fruit is not apparent as the beer is cold but nectarine comes into play as the beer warms. Very thick mouth feel which is nice but gives this beer a seemingly bigger ABV than 8%.

322,"2013-04-13",4.5,"Double Sunshine pours about medium orange. Darker than I expected. Its quite hazy, and that cloudiness makes the color seem a bit flat, rather than glowy. On the other hand, it has a truly excellent head. The foam is a bit rocky and bone white. Very good retention. A couple inches of bubbles stayed up for a long time, and theres lots of lacing. Bubbles are all over the walls of the glass. 

The aroma is a superb tropic fruit salad of hoppiness. Pineapple and mango for days. Theres also some bright tangerine, lemon and peach flavors in the mix and a touch of pine at the end. Best of all, the aroma is fresh and strong. Hops hit me right as the cap came off the bottle. Juicy as can be. Theres probably a touch of pale malt in the background, but this is a hop party. 

The taste is similarly loaded to the gills with tropical fruit hop flavors, though theres a bit more citrus to it. It tastes like pineapple-tangerine joy. Its sweet and bright, but the hops show a little muscle with some solid bitterness that courses through each sip. However, its among the most flavorful bitter hop notes that Ive come across, just a perfect level to keep the sweetness from running away. Mild honey-ish pale malt flavors hold up all of these wonderful hop flavors, and it stays appropriately out of the way. Finish is long and full of pineapple, pine and grapefruit hop flavors. 

Mouthfeel is creamy and full, but the beer still seems pretty light. Theres a very pleasant hop oiliness to the beer. Carbonation is pretty normal. Good stuff.

This is an absolutely wonderful beer. Ive had a lot of DIPAs, and this one is way up near the top for me. The hop flavors are big, juicy and bright, and the tropical fruitiness is just great. I particularly like the flavor-packed taste, which doesnt scrimp too much on bitterness. The malt doesnt get in the way, and there are simply no real flaws to point out.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Creamy peach and pine flavor, relaxed, but strong enough, with a mild cannabis backing flavor; nothing particularly cool here, but its totally solid.  Thick palate, only lightly carbonated, finishes dryly but with drawn out alcohol and floral bitterness; california style-light suits me just fine.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
322,"2012-08-10",4.8,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2014 Bottle shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike!

The beer is a clear, golden hue with a thick finger of white head that leaves a generous amount of lacing on the glass.

The aroma is awesome, and I know right away that Im in for a treat. Pine, grapefruit, melon, citrus.

The taste does not disappoint, bringing a healthy dose of fresh hops and citrus fruits. Alcohol content is masked extremely well in both the aroma and flavor. At 8% abv, this beer is dangerously easy to quaff. Hoppy grapefruit juice. Mmm.

The feel is light to medium bodied with a very nice feel on the palate. The finish brings a healthy dose of dryness and bitter hops.

Overall, a terrific beer and well worth trying. Ive been pretty impressed with everything I have had from Lawsons Finest Liquids so far.

This beer pours a cloudy and bright tangerine orange in color with a two finger, bright white head. The nose is extremely fresh and full of pineapple and that trademark Smcoe aroma. Despite that, its pretty fruit forward as far as the hops are concerned with a touch of pine. Its very aromatic. The flavors are dry and fruity, very fresh with loads of fresh hop presence. It drinks slightly bitter and slightly dry. The malt bill is lighter, helping drinkability. The alcohol isnt present either. Overall this is a really, really nice DIPA.

322,"2012-05-15",3.6,"From notes.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip.

Out of the bottle, my pour is a golden sunshine color with a generous white cap.  A bit of sticky lace clings to my glass as I work my way through it.

The aroma is hop forward.  Grassy, herbal, with grapefruit, some tropical fruits, and a bit of pine.

Up front a little bit of sweet caramel malt hangs on for a little while, providing a balance that I dont need in my DIPAs.  Grapefruit, mango, peach, tangerine, and apricot all provide a strong fruit presence, which overlays a generally grassy bitterness.  The malt maintains a bit of sweetness and a chewy breadiness throughout.

The carbonation is creamy and on the full side.  Although there is a grainy nature to the beer itself, it also has a smoothness about it.  There is no real alcohol presence noticeable in the taste.  The bitterness grows with each sip, but there is not an overwhelming aftertaste or anything.

This is definitely a solid beer, but I was not as blown away by it as many other people have been.  This is a mystery that may only be resolved with a follow up tasting.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

A - Pours murky golden orange with a nice one finger tall white head leaving light rings of lace down the glass. I got the last of the bottle so mine was a little murkier than the others.

S - Smells of pungent grapefruits, citric hops, fresh pine needles and a growing caramel sweetness. I would say that the nose is the best part of this beer.

A - Gorgeous pour. SRM of 8.5. Deep orange appearance like a light orange soda. Very rich hazy appearance. My standard pour yielded a 2 finger off white to slight yellow head with a creamy top that subsided very little in 5 minutes.

S - Delicious dry hop aroma. Nice grapefruit and orange zest smells followed by lemon juice, a bit of apricot and pineapple. Theres a mild spice to this beer. 

T - Well, Im going to try my best to get the hop profiles correct. Im getting Centennial, Columbus and Amarillo hops. Dry hop is citra and this leads me to an overwhelming ruby red grapefruit taste. Mild pepper notes and a weak level of orange skins. Reminds me of my whole juiced oranges I have every day at home. Finish is a fleeting dry hop taste and almonds.

M - 60% carbonation on the mouth swish. Heavy body for an IPA. Mouth feel is slick and the dry hops stick around for a nice bit of time.

O - When I first rated this beer in January, it was perhaps my 5th IPA ever and the 2nd IPA I had ever rated. Now, Ive rated about 50 and had over 100 IPAs since then. So, now that my palate has changed a bit, I dont think its as good as it was when I first had it. Its still a ""nectar of the gods"" sort of beer but its no Heady Topper and it doesnt stand up to the hoppy beers released by Hill Farmstead.

Taste is more sharp--lots of really bitter citrus rind that lasts through the long finish. A bit minty with a good deal of syrupy sweet malt. A bit too bitter for my tastes, but it kind of grew on me too. Slick and resiny, with pretty little carbonation.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
322,"2011-12-12",3.4,"Bottle from Ethan, shared with Mike.  Hazy gold with a ncie white head.  Nose is citra - sweaty lemon, pineapple, some mint.  That all continues into the flavor - strange sweaty citrus and a slightly funky bitterness.  A bit heavy in terms of mouthfeel.  A bit more bitter than I would prefer.  Still, a solid beer.","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"

Pours a cloudy, golden sunshine color with orange and lemon yellow hues and a one finger white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Spotty lacing left behind.

Sweet citrus hop aroma with dank, resinous hop oils and tons of citrus and tropical. fruit. Slightly piny with lots of pineapple, grapefruit and lemon peel.

Medium bodied with a blast a dry, earhy hops which provide a perfect dry bitterness that lingers over the sweet fruit notes into a bone dry finish.  Lots of grapefruit and sweet pineapple along with zesty lemon peel.  Pale malt backbone with biscuit and cracker providing a nice counter without taking away from the hop bitterness.  Simply put, this beer tastes amazing.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

322,"2011-06-05",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 14, 2014 Tap at ACBF. Hazy copper pour with a fluffy head. Aroma and flavor are both slammed with peach, apricot, mango, and pine hop presence. Reminds me a bit of Sculpin, but more sticky and sweet, and with more evergreen. The hops at the finish lose just a touch of its character and become more non-descript in their bitterness, which keeps this from the upper echelon of the style. Still, very good.

Rerate 9/14/14 -- Ive had this a couple times since my first rating, but this is the bottle that made me want to up my rating. Gorgeously clean on the palate, and there is a remarkable combination of sticky, old school resinous hops still in the foreground, but beautiful mango and papaya shows itself in the background as well. Lovely stuff.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

Aromas are vibrant citrus, melons and grapefruit with some bready malts, toast, and pale malts. With some rounded citrus, florals. Initial is medium bodied, a healthy citrus bite, lemons and grapefrui, oranges moving into peaches, vibrant florals, touches of grass, some light dry pine. Finish is dry, some sticky malts, bready, with some toast. Lingering sticky sweet malts, bright vibrant citrus and florals. Mmmmmm.

322,"2011-04-24",4.0,"Huge, huge thanks to imagineiii for sending this bottle my way. Ive been looking to try this for awhile now. Served in a Bruery tulip.

Pours a bright, clear golden yellow color with a good white head and plenty of lacing as it goes down. The nose immediately lets me know that this is going to be delicious. It has loads of citrus character along with a bit of pine; slightly dank. Great hoppiness. The flavor carries the same notes, and the citrus hop character pairs really well with a great amount of bitterness. Very good. Light to medium body with a great dry finish. Very, very nice overall.

Lovely mouthfeel, creamy and crisp at once. Yummy as it is, seems to get a bit more raves than normal owing to its rarity. But still a rocker.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

A nice white head, great retention and lacing... The aroma is fantastic, so fresh, just plucked pine needles with pineapples and an assortment of tropical fruits... Taste is equally great, bitting pine and alcohol of a dipa, but muted and so drinkable. This is awesome, must try.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
322,"2011-03-23",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2011 In short: A superb easy to drink blonde Double IPA with a complex hop profile.
How: Tap at Black Back pub, Waterbury VT
The look: Cloudy blonde body topped by a medium white head with good retention
In long: Nose is an explosion of floral, tropical fruits, grassy and foresty hops.  Its all there, its bright and vibrant.  Plenty of crackers-like pale malts to provide a full body while leaving all the flavor space to for the hops.  Aforementioned hops (floral, tropical fruits, grassy and foresty) in large quantities.  Despite being a heavily hopped 8% brew the beer is actually not aggressive.  No alcohol presence.  Somewhat refreshing and sessinonable (ouch!).  Another mighty fine hoppy ale from Lawsons.  I hope Lawsons will one day expand their operation because they make superb IPAs.  Man that was good.  I had too much to drink again at this beer event and now Im afraid there might actually be something wrong with me.  Its probably nothing but sometimes I wonder if I should I be concerned that my liver is making strange noises or that my right testicle is larger than my other two.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Light weed y body with grass and a just dead drying with no residual sweetness that lightens the body.  Great shit.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"

322,"2011-02-06",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Coniferous, grassy hop fireworks explode everywhere from aroma to finish for pure, unadulterated Double IPA glory.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy sheet of foam tops the hazy blond.
-The grassy, herbal hop bitterness is intense; this is for hopheads only.
-The fluffy carbonation and svelte body make this quite friendly, offsetting some of the boastful hoppiness.
-Malts are only there to provide a trampoline on which the multifarious hop personality (piney, herbal, citrusy, etc.) can loudly play.
-Alcohol is not a bother in the flavor profile, as it is smothered in hops!
