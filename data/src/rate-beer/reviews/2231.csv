Taste is not too sweet toasted caramel malt, some spicy earthy hoppiness with a subtle fruity tang. Average carbonation, light-medium bodied, lightly hopped. Clean and tasty.

2231,"2015-01-02",3.3,"Poured from 650mL bottle. Clear, orangey amber with minimal off-white head. Aroma has lots of caramel and toasted malt. Taste has lots of toasted malt, a little corn, and some subtle hops. Not bad for the style.","British Columbia, CANADA","pictoman"
2231,"2014-12-28",3.4,"Foamy off-white head atop a deep copper colour. Nose of light bread. Finally a marzen that doesnt turn my stomach. Some smokiness, toast and orange rind. Very interesting. Not terribly Oktoberfest but tasty.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
2231,"2014-12-27",3.2,"Bottle. Mid-amber with a good white lacing. Sweet malts and alcohol dominate in a heavy bodied beer. Generally well-balanced and a thoroughly authentic re-creation of this German style.","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Vladivostok"
2231,"2014-10-15",3.4,"On tap. Pours a clear mahogany with light head. Aromas of toasted biscuits and grass. Flavors are same with additional light notes of sugar and dried banana. On style. Just a boring style.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Gerbeer"
2231,"2014-10-11",3.3,"650mL bottle, pours clear orange amber with a small beige head. Aroma brings out corn, cereal malt an light fruitiness. Flavour is clean and crisp, with caramel, corn and unmistakeable German malts. Dry, flavourful and crisp, with lots of flavour. Very nice stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2231,"2014-10-07",4.1,"Bottle, Legacy. Deep brown-amber colour. Thin, bubbly head. The aroma is both caramelly and toasty, rich and complex. Good body, with a toffeeish dark sugar note, caramelization of the malts coming through fresh. Perhaps a touch more toasty towards the finish. Earthy bitterness throughout, courtesy of some subtle hop work. That dryness makes this very moreish. Autumnal, no question. For those keeping score at home, this is three for three - do we have Canadas new lager champions?","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

Caramel profile, light residual sweetness, straws, nutty, but the malt doesnt provide enough quality or excitement; correct bitterness. Very clean though.2014-09-28, draught at Alibi Room, Vancouver, 7-5-6-3-14=35Dark amber color, hazy, with compact head. Delicate, nice aroma of malt with a touch of bread, caramel, hay. The body is just a bit lighter than expected; it has a flavor profile similar to the aroma, but milder, with correct bitterness. Clean beer.Although not a big fan of the style, this one is well brewed, as usual.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
