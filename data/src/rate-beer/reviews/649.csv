649,"2017-03-31",3.6,"16 oz. can from the Free Beer Week box sent by gregwilsonstl - thanks again, Greg! Pours a dark, nearly opaque coffee brown with a finger of tan head that settles into a ring and light film, leaving a few ropes of trailing lace in the glass. Super smooth, with creamy milk chocolate and fudge, sutble vanilla, tobacco-like hops, mild coffee and roasted malts, and the slightest dark fruit tang. Light-bodied, with a smooth, thin, sweet mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Really easy sipper. Not overly sweet. The vanilla here is subtle, and I appreciate that.

649,"2016-08-30",3.5,"Shared 16 oz. can poured to snifters at Lunar Brewing Co., showing a black/brown hue, with a respectable layer of brownish tan head foam, and spots & strands of lacing. The aroma presented hints of freezer burn & woodiness, roastiness, cocoa, vanilla bean including the skin, and a bit of caramel sweetness. A little less than medium bodied, with fair carbonation, and a touch of creaminess to the mouthfeel, the taste was somewhat similar to the nose, with a distinct dose of tobacco that partnered with dryness, and a roasted & earthy bitterness. The texture was also milder than medium, and although not all that sweet & robust, this Stout offered a fairly decent smoothness & tastiness.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

There is a lot of roasty malt. A decent chocolate, lightly bitter, light vanilla and a strong lactose. Light, but not bad. The flavor is more roasty. There is a bit of a bitter chocolate and a light vanilla. Its decent. Heavy roast and light bitter chocolate define it. Maybe a light sweet lactose on the finish. The mouth feel is thin and watery at first, but the carbonation is excellent. The aftertaste is roasty and dry with a hint of bitter chocolate and a light vanilla-tinted lactose.

649,"2016-04-28",3.7,"This was poured into an English pub glass.
The appearance was a black color with a small white head. Quick light dissipation. Remnants of stringy sliding lacing.
The smell had a large portion of roasted coffee beans, subtle black licorice, the obvious vanilla bean sweetness.
The taste was basically the same. Subtle sweet to roasted edge of a coffee aftertaste. Dry semi-roasty finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body. Decent sessionability. Carbonation feels good as a milk/sweet stout.

649,"2015-06-02",3.7,"Sometimes you think youre getting a stout with frills, but you really dont and it ends up being a fine beer anyway. Finchs Secret Stache Stout is an example of what I mean: it claims to be a milk stout made with vanilla, but I really didnt get any. Thats okay, but the result is a solid, good-tasting, easy-drinking beer at a good price, too.

I poured a 16oz can into an English pint glass. It had an enjoy-by date of 9/23/15 and cost $2.59 ($0.16 per ounce).

Appearance: Typical black color with ruby red edges. Pours to a large, brown, frothy head which laces and retains quite well.

Smell: Noticeably vanilla sweetness at first, but quickly overshadowed by the base milk stout brew with noticeable lactose aroma and roasted malt. A bit mild, though.

Taste: Sometimes I notice when a brew is marketed as brewed with a certain specialty ingredient, that ingredient is only noticeable on the first few swigs and then blends in with the rest of the palette. Thats what happened here. The vanilla was relatively sweet, not unlike that of a candy bar. Far from cloying, for sure. It eventually fades and drinks like a familiar, traditional stout. The lactose sugar imparts some light sweetness while roasted malts offer a bit of contrast in the way of somewhat bitter/burnt flavors. Not much in the way of distinct hop flavor, though theres enough to give the palette balance. Overall, its enjoyable but I cant help but think so much more couldve been done.

Drinkability: At only 5.3% ABV, Finchs Secret Stache Stout is far from any kind of obese, imperial brew  yet too hefty to be a session beer. Theres quite a lot of body to the mouthfeel  its soft and fairly thick, but calm with a smooth texture. It leaves a slight tang in the aftertaste, but is otherwise clean. This feels like a heavier beer than it is, though. One pint was more than satisfying.

649,"2014-10-09",3.6,"16oz can poured into a shaker. The aroma is a combination of milk chocolate, coffee, and grains with a light vanilla touch late. It pours a dark, opaque black with a light, tan creamy head that reduced unevenly. A dense, sheet lace is left behind as well as a thick, foamy ring with a fuzzy, solid surface. The taste is a chocolatey, medium sweet and bitter balance. The oily texture has a medium body and a prickly carbonation. Dark chocolate and vanilla are prevalent throughout the drink and on the finish with some cereal and a touch of caramel. The chocolate is dominant and somewhat heavy and lingering on the aftertaste.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

 Served on tap in a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer is served a deep brown color with a one finger of brown head. The head fades almost instantly to leave a light level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is heaviest of a roasted malt smell mixed with a nice heavy coffee smell. Along with these aromas are some sweeter aromas of a caramel nature mixed with a little bit of a vanilla smell. A little bit of a chocolate aroma mixes with the rest producing a rather nice and sweet dark smell.

 Taste  The taste begins roasty and sweet with a good level of caramel and vanilla sweetness as well a nice roasted malt base. As the flavor advances some lighter flavors of a coffee nature come to the tongue, which start out quite light, but gains intensity as the flavor moves more toward the end. Along with this, a little bit of cocoa sweetness comes to the tongue being complimented nicely by the sweeter flavors of the beer. With a lighter flavor of char also joining the tongue at the end of the taste, one is left with a nice roasty and sweet flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average side in its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. The lower carbonation level is very nice for the roasted, cocoa and coffee flavors of the brew, nicely enhancing all the more intense flavors. A little thicker of a body may have been even better for the brew, but overall, at only 5.3% abv., the body was quite appropriate.

 Overall  For an only 5.3 % abv brew, this beer packs quite the flavor punch. A nice and tasty session style stout.","","Darkmagus82"

649,"2014-08-22",3.4,"8/22/14. 16oz can from Five Points. This certainly showed up in Valdosta randomly. Deep black pour with a nice tan head that looks good at first but fades to nothing but a ring and very minimal lacing pretty quickly. Im more than halfway through my glass and I see just hardly little spritzes of ringed, webbed lacing after certain drinks. For whatever reason the aroma screams soy sauce to me - meaty, savory, salty in a way - followed by a bit of ashiness and dark chocolate. I cant say Im scoping much vanilla out of this on the aroma at least. Ive been contemplating this brew as I go, and what strikes me is the dry acidity of an Irish stout but fuller bodied and with a huge ashy aspect on top of that meaty, salty, soy sauce aspect I found in the aroma. The lactose serves to smooth it out a bit and sweeten the mid-palate as well as leave a really nice creamy slickness on my tongue that Im actually enjoying quite a bit. This may also partially because of the pairing with vanilla in there, which comes through a touch in the flavor (definitely more than I was finding in the aroma). Well, I suppose Ill finish my 4-pack, but I dont see myself seeking this out in the future. Not bad.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

649,"2014-08-13",4.4,"A: Roasted dark malts during the initial inhale, followed by distinct oatmeal and barley. Sure smells like an oat:meal stout. Hints of dark chocolate and vanilla are also present. If the taste is anything like the aroma then this is going to be a fantastic stout. 

A: A slightly thicker generous pour resulted in a really thin beige head. The color was dark motor oil brown in appearance. Real dark, like no light was getting through this glass. Respectable lacing clung tight while draping itself down the side of my glass. So far, so good

T: Like the smell, roasted dark malts with a lightly bitter finish. Oats and vanilla precede the mild bitter finish. Although I got the dark chocolate smell, only the bitterness of dark chocolate was noticeable. After the swallow, a coffee like taste remains on the tongue. This is really flavorful for a lighter stout. I must say again, it reminds me of fine oatmeal stout, which I really do enjoy. 

P: Thicker body on the tongue with a creamy smooth texture from start to finish, almost an oily feel when I take a longer sip. Carbonation is minimal, but present. As noted above, a coffee like taste remains between sips.

O: My first Finchs Beer Company beer and wont be my last. According to their website, lactose was used during the brewing process. I didnt get the normal sweetness and lessening of bitterness lactose tends to add to a stout. Either way, this is a great stout in my opinion. I love the fact it comes in a 16-ounce can.

649,"2014-06-06",2.9,"16 oz. can, consumed on 6-4-14. Musty, dusty, dry aroma features coffee, tar, cigarettes, and, especially, poop. Notice that all of those scents are unpleasant (including coffee -- yuck!), although this beer smells not quite as bad as those things do (but, make no mistake, it does smell bad). Also smores and bran muffins scents. Pours a dark brown with a large amount of thick, fluffy, tan head. Cola-like appearance in the liquid. Produces good lacing. Looks good. Quite sweet amd milky taste features flavor elements of chocolate milk, minerals, sugar, chocolate cupcake with chocolate frosting, and vanilla. Melon and peach in the finish. None of the offputting elements of the aroma make it into the flavor. Lightly dry, slightly chemical-y aftertaste. Light body. Soft and frothy in the palate. Insubstantial palate effects. Finchs Secret Stache Stout tastes very good but smells like a New York bar bathroom. It also looks good but has a subpar palate. That makes it hard to evaluate overall. It is unusual, and I do give it credit for uniqueness, at least among American sweet stouts (I suspect some old-fashioned English examples of the style share some similarities).

A: Pours a nearly pitch black color. Not much head is on this one, which is disappointing - it isnt even a fingers high, but it has a nice khaki shade. The only thing noteworthy about it is the slight lacing it leaves on the glass.

S: Theres plenty of roasted malt, which I always love in a stout. Beyond that lies notes of cream, chocolate, and vanilla. The advertised vanilla is evident...but not quite as much as I want it to be. Oh well.

T: However, it does make a decent showing on the palate. Vanilla notes blend fairly well with the cream flavors, before finishing with touches of roasted malt. Decently enjoyable if simplistic and sweet.

M: It doesnt have the finishing dryness I like out of my favorite stouts, nor the body. What it does do well, though, is showcase the vanilla flavors decently through a soft, creamy finish. Carbonation is good, but could aid drinkability a little more.

Pours pitch plack with a thin quarter inch dark tan head that fades away within a minute to some swirling on top of the beer. A few splotches of lacing on the sides of the glass but not much else. A little bit of a let-down.

The aroma, however, more than makes up for the unimpressive aroma as it really blows me away. Tons of milk chocolate leaping out as well as coffee and a healthy dose of vanilla. There is a moderate roast tying it all together but a really mouthwatering and delicious aroma throughout.

The flavor is even better. The vanilla really stands out married nicely with milk chocolate. Almost reminds me of chocolate milk or a Hersheys bar. Coffee is there but remains in the background lending just enough roastiness to keep things from getting too sweet. Some swirls of caramel also come through with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel finish with just a little stickyness and lingering roast.

Overall, this is possibly one of the best lower strength American Stouts I have had. The vanilla is perfectly done as it is all too often overwhelming in beers. All flavors balance perfectly and the body is awesome. Definitely a beer you should pick up if you get the chance.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

649,"2013-04-01",4.0,"Pours pitch black with a huge ""milk chocolate"" head. Carbonation level is on the lower side (which I appreciate) so it (the head) doesnt stay around for too long, oh well. Aroma is really nice, with faint notes of vanilla, coffee and chocolate, I use the word ""faint"" but Id rather say ""in their place"" as none is overpowering the other, quite wonderful! Flavor is also not overpowering, unlike many beers out there there is no standout flavor here. I get a little chocolate, a little coffee and a little vanilla - in that order. It is really balanced and not a flavor bomb which often come out as roasted malts or ash bombs when speaking about stouts, a really masterful act here!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

Appearance: Pitch black... car oil kind of black. Theres a tiny head, but it goes away almost instantly, with just a thin, brown layer of foam on top. Lacing, at least initially, is sexy.

Smell: Super dark, roasted malts is the most notable thing here. However, theres plenty of chocolate-like notes as well, with some vanilla. The vanilla definitely comes out more in the aroma than it does in the flavor, which MAY be a good thing. (The vanilla is the main thing that drew me to this beer).

Taste/feel: What a stout. Forget the fact that it comes from a can. What. A. Stout. Balanced very, very well. Its never too sweet, or too bitter. Front of the sip is a bit of dark fruits (?) for sweetness, but then theres pretty much nothing but malty, chocolate goodness until the end. As the beer warms up, the beer seems to get a tad bit more bitter, and the vanilla comes out a LITTLE more, but I notice a lot of people complaining about the vanilla in it. To be honest, I dont really get much at all (at least when its cold)... and that disappoints me. Its there in a subtle way, but I actually wanted a little bit more. Regardless of that, this is still a slick-in-the-mouth, quality stout: an absolute delight.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

649,"2012-08-04",3.2,"Bomber bottle from Binnys and served in Duvel snifter: Pours a deep brown near opaque with an initial frothy deep tan head which does fade leaving good rings of lace. The aroma has notes of roast and toast, some coffee, chocolate, vanilla and leather, light prune, liquorice and fig, with a dash of grassy hops. The taste is rather straight forward sweet and roasted malts along with chocolate and light vanilla. Some dark fruit and lactic twang with a cardboardy and ashy finish. The mouth feel is smooth and ashy. It is okay, the vanilla is quite restrained which for me is a good thing. Honestly something I will likely not buy again.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

649,"2012-05-12",3.8,"22 ounce bottle.  Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch brown head that stays around for a while.  Theres a good amount of lacing left on the glass.  Aroma is a bit light, but still nice.  The brew smells like bittersweet and milk chocolate, vanilla, roasted malt, and a little bit of coffee.  The taste is just like the aroma, but I think its stronger in comparison to the aroma.  Also, I think this is more of a sweeter stout as the milk chocolate and vanilla flavors are stronger than the other ones are.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit slick and creamy with good carbonation.  I think its a good overall brew, its definitely worth a try at $5.99 a bomber.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

The aroma picked up roasty chocolate and other black malts with accents of vanilla and slightly-sweetened licorice.. nice, but just a hair sweet for me.  The flavor found burnt licorice and sweeter, milky chocolates at the core.. grainy cocoa and sweet vanilla on the edges.. finished sweet with residual cocoa and licorice sugars plus a welcome hit of lactic sourness.. tasty stuff.  Medium-plus bodied and quite dense on the palate.. good feel and flow, but too thick and a little cloying at times.. overall really, really good stuff!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

On tasting, much the same. Nice level of cocoa, medium-full bodied, creamy. The vanilla is not overpowering, which is nice. One of my favorites from Finchs...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
649,"2012-03-26",3.9,"A: This stout pours a real nice oily black. In fact there is no light visible through the beer even being held up to a light. A beautiful mocha one finger head forms that recedes quickly. The lacing on this thing is ridiculously awesome. As the head does recede it just clings to my glass and as I tip and swirl it just grabs on and slowly glides back down.

S: Upon first smell I definitely pick up the vanilla (it is an ale brewed with vanilla). In fact it smells like a vanilla marshmallow. I also pick up some bitter chocolate, roasted malts and ever so slight coffee.

T: In the taste I do get the vanilla although not as I was expecting. It is sweet at first taste but then the bitter chocolate takes over. I pick up some wood/smokey notes on the finish.

M: The mouthfeel is rather light and not as chewey as I thought it might be. I get a mild prickliness from the carbonation although it is very moderate. As I allow it to coat my mouth it does seem to linger after swallowing and the creamy feel is intriging. The more I sip and review I am enjoying the mouthfeel on this one. Not too viscous and not too watery. 

O: At $5.99 this one is hard to beat! Great job Finchs on a really enjoyable easy drinking stout. I hope they offer this one again because I would buy more for sure.","Illinois, USA","Sleuthdogg"

A cheap bottle was my first pickup after relocating and checking out some of the local stores. Based on this I hope a couple more of their beers make it down south. A solid beer is worth checking it if you happen to have access to it.

Aroma / Appearance - The oily black pour was deep, dense, and darker than I thought possible for a mere 5% ABV release. The mocha tinted head is just as dark. Coffee, vanilla, and a rich chocolate feel give this the texture of a velvet cupcake next to a cup of Starbucks espresso.

Flavor / Palate - Chewiness provides a nice ebb and flow. With smokiness, chocolate, and a bitter undertone the beer entices you to keep going back for more until the bottle is empty. This is a solid release regardless of the fact that it is a mere $4.99. Chicago has yet another promising up and coming brewery to add to the list of options.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
649,"2012-03-06",3.8,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a 14.75 oz. stout/porter glass.

Ar: Vanilla and roasted malt fills the nostrils with chocolate and toffee undertones.

Ap: Pours almost pitch black with a dark tan half finger head that dissipates quickly into a thin foam ring that borders the inside of the glass. 

T: Vanilla and burnt caramel dominate, transitions into roasted malt that turns back to vanilla and finishes smooth with a touch of sweetness.

P: Near perfect carbonation for the style. Medium body that at times shows a bit more muscle. Slick yet satifying.

O: This is truly a solid offering from Finch, and their best beer to date. Very drinkable, yet has enough body to leave no doubt that this is a stout. Very reasonable $5.99 price point.","Illinois, USA","chanokokoro"
649,"2012-03-02",3.1,"Bomber. Black body with no head. A few fizzy bubbles. Chocolate aroma with notes of vanilla, cocoa, ash. charred wood. The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly bitter. It finishes lightly to moderately sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture and moderate carbonation. Dry ashiness dominates the taste with notes of chocolate and a hint of vanilla. Average stout, lacking the richness and complexity of better stouts.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
649,"2012-03-02",3.6,"22 oz bottle from Binnys South Loop (Chicago, IL). Opted to by a bottle over having it at a fest. Pours a rich blackish hue, inky opaque body is dark and intimidating, a frother darker brown head sits atop, froths at a decent layer, laces well and sticks around. Surprisingly dark and firm. Aromas throw a healthy deal of vanilla, creamy sweetness yet mellow, with touches of cocoa, soda bread, dryness, and toffee. Biscuits and milk chocolate, coffee and cream. Vanilla beans, touches of dry earth and ashy qualities. Initial is medium bodied, perhaps a bit more (surprising forr its ABV girth) than expected, with a good deal of vanilla, cocoa, and dryness. Touches of ash, soda bread, biscuits. Into the middle roasty and earthy, ashy and dry, covering up some cocoa, coffee, and lingering vanilla. Overall, pretty well put together, the vanilla is firm but not overdone as the backend provides some healthy dryness to combat any sweetness that may have started to get out of hand. If anything, Im surprised it doesnt get as such. Pretty nice, lingering coffee, biscuits, and vanilla into the finish. Pretzels stick with me into the afterglow. Pretty nice beer by Finch here.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
649,"2012-03-02",3.7,"Pours a black, very thick and a low, dense, deep dark tan head that sits atop it. Aroma has a lot of burn malt notes, light coffee with a finishing dark chocolate sweetness. Flavor has a pronounced hefty acrid roasted kick but this is quickly countered by a strong dark chocolate sweetness. Some coffee notes are in there but come off more like a good hot chocolate due to the bitter/sweetness combo described earlier. Beer is oily, thick and contains almost zero carbonation. Overall a very tasty brew but I dont get any vanilla. Vanilla is normally one of those ingredients that you smell right off the bat, not the case here. A tasty brew as a whole and I love the density of it as this is becoming harder to find.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"
649,"2012-02-29",3.5,"This is extremely dark for a beer of this gravity, opaque black with a deep brown head. Even so, it is not harsh or overbearing. Dark chocolate is the main aromatic componenet with abit of coffee. The vanilla is subdued and lens a smooth fruity quality. My only complaints are a bit of ash flavor and a slight alcoholic heat. Still, those are minor at the worst. The creamy texture and full flavor at a relatively low gravity make this a very satisfying brew.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

649,"2012-02-27",3.5,"No matter how I poured this, I could not get it to form a head, except for a few dark tan bubbles across the top.  Aroma is simpler than I had hoped for: mostly vanilla with some chocolate and roasted coffee flavors.  Body is as full as expected, with a texture between oily and milky.  Hardly any carbonation. Taste is sweet with a little hoppy bitterness in the finish.  Very drinkable but overall not as good as I expected from Finchs.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ccex"
649,"2012-02-26",3.1,"Not much going on aroma wise.  Some general roast character and a hint of vanilla.  A very violent pour produced almost no head.  What there was was the color of medium toast.  ""soap bubbles"" linger on the sides.  The taste is of espresso and vanilla.  A bit of oak (probably from the vanilla, not actual oak).  Medium-thick body and a lot of residual sweetness.  The low carbonation is perfect for the style.  This would do well on nitro.  Overall, a mixed bag.  I wish there were more aroma and a touch less sweetness, but the flavor and carbonation are spot on.  This is the best Ive seen from Finchs thus far.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","GlassBrass440"
