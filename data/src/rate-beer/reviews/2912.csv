2912,"2015-11-22",4.0,"Pours gold into a snifter. White head with little retention recedes to hug rim. Fresh apple aromas. Dry with sour and dusty apple front to back.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
2912,"2013-06-01",3.8,"Bottle brought back from Vermont and shared with my wife.  Cork comes off with a huge pop but doesnt overflow fortunately.  Pours a clear gold with a huge white head while pouring that settle down quickly.  Big sweet apple on the nose, juicy and hiding a light tartness behind it.  Medium bodied with an ample amount of carbonation.  Dries out more quickly and thoroughly than expected from the nose.  Dry and crisp, a bit of champagne yeast into the finish.  Crisp and easy drinking, lightly tart and with just a faint hint of alcohol peeking through.  Well done.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
2912,"2012-02-25",2.9,"750ml cork and caged bottle, pours a crystal clear yellow color and lots of tiny bubbles.  Aromas of bubble gum and apples, flavors of dry champagne and apples at the end.  Would have rated higher if it wasnt extremly dry, this tasted pretty much like champagne to me.","Florida, USA","burg326"
2912,"2011-11-28",3.0,"**WARNING** This is my first cider review other than Strongbow in the UK which is just candy with alcohol. ***WARNING*** Bottle from Zane. Was looking forward to a nice Vermont hard cider for Thanksgiving....too bad this wasnt it.  Pours an effervescent yellow with tons of bubbles.  Nose is of white wine with the smallest amount of apple only if you know it is a cider.  Taste is of booze and bad white wine.  No apple taste until it warms up A LOT.   Overall, VERY disappointing.  This was a drain pour, even for the guys looking to get drunk on Thanksgiving.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"
2912,"2010-10-28",4.4,"The cork comes off with a loud ""pop"".  A little bit of foaming, but luckily Ive got a glass nearby.    Pours a clear golden yellow with lots of small carbonation bubbles constantly racing to the top.  Looks great in a Hill Farmstead tasting glass.  The aroma of brett, spice and a touch of alcohol rise up from the glass.  Sweet and dry with a nice earthiness to it.  Also picking out some barrel notes on nose with a hint of vinegar.  The taste follows the nose with some earthy dry brett that balances out the cider sweetness.  A hint of spice with dry apple and a bit of peel.   Wood tannin and light cider vinegar acidity.  Mouthfeel is spritzy, little bit of foam, dry, some warming alcohol and a light sourness/tartness.  Great stuff.  Ill definitely be picking up another bottle.","New Hampshire, USA","sisuspeed"
2912,"2010-09-06",2.5,"750mL Bottle. Aroma is slight, mineral-laden and a bit yeasty and 

of MacIntosh skinds. Pours a vibrant clean golden 

with no head, well sparkling. Flavors are sharp, 

bitter and of musty wild yeasts. A good bit of booze, 

some odd earthy off-flavors and odd sweetness. Not my 

cup of tea. Acrid, just bitter and undrinkable for me. My fiancee enjoyed it, but I found it messy and unbalanced.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
2912,"2009-11-17",4.4,"Poured from a bottle to a flute glass. Yellow and hazy with a champagne like head to it (i.e. fizzy). Aroma of a mixture of apples, wood, and farm. Taste once again of a variety of apples with a tart but sweet finish. A dry lingering that could be connected to the yeast and apple choice most likely. Overall a very good cider or cyder that is more American then most people think, but either way a delicious choice of drink for the thanksgiving holidays.","Delaware, USA","geofbaum"
2912,"2009-01-14",3.5,"Bottle. Pours a pale yellow with a small white fizzy head. Aroma of tart apples, leather, wood and a hint of barnyard. Flavor is tart and funky with crisp sweet apples, wood, yeast and has a semi dry finish.","Croydon, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerdedone"
2912,"2008-02-18",3.9,"Poured a clear gold color with a thin white head.  Big horse and leather aroma with some tart apple notes.  Some aroma of glue (solvents) started to come through as it warmed.  The flavor was lightly tart with a fair amount of acidity.  Apples with some leather.  Semi-dry finish with light warming.  Medium bodied.  I liked the stankiness of this cider.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
2912,"2008-02-16",4.1,"750ml. This is the first cider Ive ever rated.  Pours like applejuice with a fizzy head. Funky and yeasty aroma. Apple pie type spices in the nose also. Woody and sour aroma. Tart and really really bubbly. Ill come back and adjust these numbers after Ive rated some more cider, but I like it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","nhorween"
2912,"2008-01-08",3.4,"Thanks to JoeMcphee for sharing - I kind of like the fact that its become a tradition to have at least one cider at our tastings - it really breaks things up - hazy golden, fairly fizzy pour - aroma of funk n fruit skin, with some phenolic notes and a mild sour/tart (brett?) character - the flavor is more mild than the aroma suggests, with some light acidity, whole apple tartness (with the skins really coming through), and background funkiness - it sure hides that alcohol well though - Id still take this over champagne.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
2912,"2008-01-06",3.5,"Wow this was some funky cider.  THanks to JoeMcPhee!  Pours a sparkling light gold with a fizzy head- carbonation seems to subside after a while as well.  Aroma is funky with brett right from the start.  Good tart green sour apples in the aroma as well- a bit vegetal as well - plasticy and phenolic from the yeast.  More rubber and plastic in the flavor with vanilla phenols, apple cider, tart green granny smith apples, but not much on the wierd acetaldehyde character.  Finishes nice and tart- pretty acidic and fairly clean.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
2912,"2008-01-06",3.8,"750mL bottle from the cider-meister, JoeMcPhee. Pours a clear golden color with a medium head.  Smells faintly wild with sweet apples and granny smith apple edges.  Strong on apple skins in the aroma as well.  Taste is slightly astringent alcohol that makes the apple seem very strong.  The alcohol actually provides a good base for the cider, not making it seem weak or watery. Has a very bubbly feel and a pretty thick body for a cider.  I would call this the poor mans Etienne Dupont, with a stronger alcohol kick.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
2912,"2008-01-05",3.3,"Rich golden colour with a fast fading head.  Lovely tart funky apple aroma.  Dusty and barnyardy with a bright acidity.  Apple skin and light vanilla over the top.  Flavour is also quite tart and funky, but the palate is quite watery.  Tart and appley in the mouth, but the thinness of the palate is a little bit disappointing.  I was expecting so much more.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
2912,"2005-11-08",3.9,"2002 Bottle - No. 2284 ala Muzzlehatch. I see he has been busy spreading this one about. Bright straw yellow body with continuance of bubbles the rejuvenate a 1/4 in lid of white bubbles. Apple skin and antiseptic aromas. Sweet barnyard nose. The longer this one sets the more the true apple aromas come out. Macintosh and Delicious apples come to mind. Dry bubbly liquid hits the tongue. A sec quality to steal from the wine folks. Mild white grapes, apples, dry honey flavors all come out. A warm spiciness come in the finish. As this sets a chardonnay quality comes out and plays on the tongue. A wild blue cheese linger comes late in the flavor as well. This is a great cyder, with qualities of sparkling mead that make it even more complex. Post script. I served this one to cold to begin with. The apple flavors come out even stronger as it warm, while the other ""funky"" flavors reside in the background. Thanks Barry.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.

Nicely done French style cider.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2912,"2005-07-29",4.2,"Flashy pure shining yellow, fading white head, juicy radioactive golden appearance. Funky yeasty nose reminds of band-aid. Slightly phenolic, spoiled apples, getting farmier as it wars unveiling those horseblanket covers. Very tart in mouth, yet remaining juicy through the strong apple concentration. Still a decent residual sweetness, but the tart apples of many varieties are peely, gueuzy anbd marvellous. High sparkling carbonation, light-medium body, comfortable. Makes me want to fly straight to Normandy on the minute.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2912,"2005-07-21",3.7,"Very pleased to try this and thank-you to Muzzlehatch for bringing it to Montreal. Very pale apple juice coloured. Lots of head subsiding into a terrific soft syrup. Sappy and piles of green apple in the tart aroma. Very clean and interesting. Perfume. Barnyard and cheese.  A little must and soap. Very tastey. Re-rating soon.","Southampton, Ontario, CANADA","Crockett"
2912,"2005-03-21",3.9,"Poured light yellow with no noticeable cloudiness.  Nice carbonation with a small, but nice head that quickly dissipates.  Taste is of tarte apples, candy canes and sugar.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
2912,"2004-10-18",3.0,"April 2004.  Sweet apple like Granny smiths. Dry sour taste leaving a long layer of sourness on the tongue. Very sparkly indeed.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
2912,"2004-09-11",3.6,"Pours a clear pale golden with a large fizzy white head.  Aroma bursting with fresh tart apples.  Starts mildly sweet and fruity with a nice balance of flavors.  Body is overcarbonated and thin, finishing crisp and dry.  Still a very nice and enjoyable cider.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
2912,"2004-07-26",3.8,"Thanks to BeanDip for sharing her rarity with me and my woman! 

 Poured a clear yet pale light straw colored body and a quickly vanishing white head. The aroma is almost gueuze like.. Notes of wheat although nonexistent, and a very dry and a green apple Granny Smith tart resemblance. The flavor is pastry tart with a note of pressed sugarcane in there somewhere that keeps the aridness slightly hydrated. The palate has a champagne fizz actually this cider is a very close brute champagne cousin in my prospective! This was rather exceptional for a cyder!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
2912,"2004-07-25",4.0,"Like Johnny Appleseed, Muzzlehatch appears to have been dropping these little babies all over the country sprouting appreciation for this Vermont cider. This was first sample of a cider/lambic tasting. Certainly the least sour and easiest drinking of the bunch. Dry, tart, apples. Lightly sour and crisply refreshing. Lovely in the glass showing off its sparklingness. Slightly musty and a hint peppery, but that could have been accentuated by the cheese. Very enjoyable and many thanks to the Muzzlehatch.","Florida, USA","BeanDip"
2912,"2004-07-22",4.4,"Noted a bit of oxidation that if anything, added more depth and pungency. Sour, yeasty moss aroma. Maybe brets as well. Funky, yet bright. Flavor was that of muted Granny Smith apples with some thyme and rosemary. Beware invisible alcohol...This brewery should try making lambic, I think they would excell. Artisanal skill evident. Thanks so much Barry!","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
2912,"2004-07-18",4.0,"Bottled in 2002 - 2368 of 3150.  Pourd a pale gold color with a quickly diminishing white head and no lacing.  Funky barnyard and sweet apple aroma.  Begins initially sweet with apple, tart apple skins, and then brett.  Turns dry and still tart with very nice carbonation.  Thanks muzzlehatch!","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
2912,"2004-07-14",4.3,"Vintage 2002: Whitish straw color. Crackling bubbles subside to a wispy white ring. Intensely musty aroma with notes of green raisins, honeysuckle, bandage, and rich apple must. Becomes firmly stonelike and perfumey with a heavy swirl of the glass. Spritzy carbonation, yet remarkably feathery with a light fluff on the tongue. Jellyfish feel to the body. Staggering complexity in the flavor with plentiful bandage notes backed with bright, juicy apple must, which temporarily lessens some of the tartness. Mild cellar character coupled with toasty champagne  notes. Lovely brett astringency touched with medicine, pear, and a plethora of elegant apple subtleties. Gritty dryness in the finish resurrects the lemony tartness as restrained, spicy alcohol tingles the cheeks amid eternal bandage and perfumey brett notes. Long, focused aftertaste of juicy apple skins and brett. Awe-inspiring creation, courtesy of my friend Muzzlehatch. Wow!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2912,"2004-06-25",4.2,"Green apple tart-sweet, clean, concentrated. Intensely freshand so artisanal. Clear, sparkling gold, thinnish - exceptionally dry - sour and sweet harmoniously blended - a super treat, and many thanks to Muzzle the cider-bearing guest.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
2912,"2004-05-21",3.3,"A very sour tasting, dry, slightly musty cider from Vermont thats pretty unusual in its aggressive acidic character.  Alcohol is extremely well-hidden.  Remarkably so!  Decent nose.  I feel the French Brittany ciders have the edge.  Thanks Muzzlehatch for sharing this fine cyder.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
2912,"2004-05-03",3.2,"(750ml Bottle)Pours a huge, white head with entertaining carbonation. Nose of sweet MacIntosh apples. Constant dry flavour. Im amazed that this is 9.5% ABV. Wow! Thanks Muzzlehatch.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
2912,"2004-04-29",4.1,"Sour green apple aroma. Sparkling clear apple juice with a lasting fizzy head. Nice slightly sour and horse blanket flavour with plenty of apple character. Sparkling effervescence and yet quite full bodied. This is great. Bottle (thanks Muzzlehatch for bringing this to the post TapNY session).","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
2912,"2004-04-29",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2010 Champagney gueuze aroma of green apple acidity...Sweet, fluffy body with gum-drying tartness which ends in a dry and hay-like teeth coating...Elegant and empassioned cider, much like the best saisons and bière de gardes out there...A 2002 bottle in 2005 proved even better, this one ages perfectly and even funkifies a bit!! Ive had a few bottles of this now, and I have to say they are just better and better and better...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
2912,"2004-04-26",4.1,"Dry cider. Really good. Thanks from the guys at Tap new York, corated with them. Light and clear and even had a lasting head. Very apply. Excellent cider. Warming. Decent. Sour aroma.","paramus, New Jersey, USA","mkobes"
2912,"2004-04-25",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2004 Muzzlehatch brought this for us to try at Tap NY and get it closer to the 10 rating plateau. And the cork blasted off the ceiling when I was trying to remove it, scaring the s*%$ out of me. This is my first cider rating, and I found this to be a very nice drink. Light and clear and even had a white lasting head. Nice lambic like sour aroma. This one was dry and spritzy like champagne. Clean and warming. Decent stuff and worth seeking out, especially for cider fans.","Good Beer Bar Deprived, New Jersey, USA","MaiBockAddict"
2912,"2003-05-01",4.2,"sparkling hazy deep golden.  complex aroma of apple, lemon, barnyard and leather.  the mouthfeel is full, spritzy and soft all at the same time.  crisp sweet apple flavour balanced out with lemony and slight alcohol flavours.  a damn fine cider.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mrkimchee"
2912,"2003-04-06",4.1,"Hazy tan; large apple nose, leather, alcohol.  Fizzy but full body.  Soft apple tones. Full and fruity - eminently drinkable.  Brought me back to Somerset.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
2912,"2001-11-16",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 26, 2004 Nov 2001:  Superb champagne-like drink with powerful apple-wine aroma and intense semi-sweet flavor.  Not as dry or winelike as its non-sparkling labelmate, it is the standard to which all ciders will have to measure up to in my future tastings. 
April 2004, post TAP NY tasting.  Now I notice the gueuze-like, sour character; now also I have had many ciders to compare.  This is still the best, dry, complex and difficult...not for the faint of heart or those who think Woodchuck sets the standard.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
