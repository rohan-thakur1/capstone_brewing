11,"2014-10-03",4.6,"This is extremely similar to the regular Schneider weisse hopfenweisse. And like that beer, this one is also incredible. I would say the inherent difference is probably in the hops- the American hops gives this beer a subtle bitter tartness as opposed to the more sweet tastes in the hopfenweisse. Both beers are highly complex with amazing aromas, tastes, and palates. If this is near me, Ill be drinking it!!!! Such a great beer!","Brooklyn, New York, USA","Willsaar"

11,"2014-06-22",4.5,"It has a deep hazy orange colored body with lots of visible carbonation. The head is off white in color, tall, thick and creamy. The head is long lasting and makes lots of slick lacing on the glass. It has a light pleasant aroma of wheat, a light wisp of clove, subtle fruity yeast and just a very subtle hint of smokiness. The flavor starts with a big tangy wheat and grain base that adds fruity and spicy yeast notes of banana and clove as well as some citrus notes from the hops. The hops really stand out in the finish which becomes dry and has solid bitterness for the style. It has a full body and the texture is thick and chewy with a heavy well rounded mouth feel. Its carbonation is very active and cleansing on the palate.","New York, USA","generallee08"

11,"2013-05-03",3.6,"Pulled this out of the cellar after about 6 months but at a bit of a faux pas: I only had one bottle! So with nothing to compare it to here it goes.

A: Looks good. Like a bold wheat beer. Hazy orange but a deeper hue. Like a golden brown sort of thing. 
S: Smells like a wheat beer. Smooth. Nice,  but with a bit of funk.
T: Very interesting. Huge wheat note at the start but fades to more of an ale like taste with some hops and a bit of malt and definitely some alcohol in there. Well balanced for a high ABV wheat beer. A little aggressive on the palate but has some great wheat and earthy notes. Lingering alcohol gives a bit of a burn that seems out of place.
P: Light at first, but with a heavy finish.... a bit odd. Carbonation is moderate. Super super dry on the palate. 

Overall this is an alright beer. Lots of good notes and certainly not a bad go at an imperial wheat. The wheat is good but there is a weird funk as the beer lingers which really takes a lot away from the other fun notes. The problem is weihenstephaner just makes the best wheat beer and this one cannot compare.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Jamesthebrit"

Vielleicht sollte man ja mal den Namen aktualisieren in: ""Tap 5 Meine Hopfenweisse"". Zwar finde ich diese Durchnummerierung auch nicht wirklich gelungen, aber das Etikett ist in grün-weiß-blau noch als gelungen zu bezeichnen; der unbedruckte Kronkorken hingegen nicht. Zum Bier selbst: Sieht erstmal aus wie Weizen mit Bananensaft; sehr gelblich mit unsagbar vielen festen Bestandteilen; einzig die Schaumkrone verhindert eine schlechtere Benotung. Das Aroma hingegen entschädigt vollauf; viel Hefe mit Nelke, Harz und Hopfen vom feinsten, toll! Gehaltvoller Antrunk mit eher würzigen, wiederum harzigen Anklängen. Kaum fruchtig nach Citrusfrüchten. Dafür kommt nach den harzigen Nelkentönen gleich eine starke Hopfenherbe auf, die zuerst fast bitter ist, aber mit jedem weiteren Schluck abebbt. Der Alkoholgehalt ist nicht so deutlich wie befürchtet. Insgesamt ein spektakulärer Weizenbock mit geschmacklicher Achterbahnfahrt, die unausgewogen und etwas sperrig wirkt, aber Spaß macht!

Pours slightly hazy orange with a massive off-white head that slowly settles into smooth and even lace, leaving a bunch of residue along the inside of the glass.  The nose is fairly straight-forward German wheat beer with the anise, clove, and banana, but there is an added hop element that runs the gamut from resin to citrus to floral notes.  The flavor starts off as a big (high alcohol) wheat beer with some sweetness, banana, clove, anise, and then moves to a very clean hoppy flavor that is more floral and citrus than resin.  The body is full with an oily, slick texture, average carbonation, and a long finish that features both banana, and hops bitterness.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
11,"2011-03-05",4.3,"Reviewed from notes.

Pours a somewhat dark yellow with a nice white head. A bit hazy. Nose brings a good amount of bubblegum, banana, and clove. Also a nice citrus hop presence. The taste really elevates the hops quite a bit. Im not expert, but Id venture at least a bit of Amarillo. Good German weizen yeast characteristics as well. Good, light feel with nice carbonation. Drinks really, really well. Im a big fan of this.

11,"2011-02-21",3.9,"750 ml corked bottle, a slightly different presentation from the Schneider one.

This one has a great scent, you can smell the dry hopping and it has a nice citrus spice character. Theres some traditional fruity wheaty hefe scent in here too which intrigues me to try it. The dry hops in this one were more impressive than the ones in the Schneider.

Its a taste experience, it has a nice balance though its as expected a far hoppier version of the darker hefes. It starts with a typical wheat flavor and then leads into a nice bit of hops, nice and bitter.

Its medium bodied and not quite the most drinkable brew. 

Overall its a style thats very taboo and hard to find a decent example of but this is probably the quintiseential hopfen-weisse.

Put against the Schneider one they are almost equal with this one smelling and looking slightly better an the Schneider one tasting slightly better.

Slight touches of pine are coming through, but I am mainly getting a nice orange/grapefruit citrus hop aroma. Banana and yeast are hitting my nostrils as well, but not at the same level as the hops. I am only slightly getting some clove, but not much. A nice variety of fruitiness in the aroma. Wow, the hops arent that present in terms of flavor. Actually, the hops provide a nearly perfect balance between sweet and bitter. A nice banana cream and yeast flavor are noticed right away. The citrus hops are hitting my taste buds at certain points. The grapefruit flavor mixes very well with that banana cream flavor. The hops provide a lasting bitterness that isnt incisive in the least. Very smooth texture. On the verge of being a little too carbonated, but still has a wonderfully smooth texture. Great brew.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

11,"2010-01-29",4.0,"Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen Weisse is a weizenbock brewed as a collaboration between the Brooklyn Brewery of New York and J. Schneider & Sohn of Germany (specifically, their brewmaster Hans-Peter Drexler). Even though this version was made in America, its German roots shine through with a robust, spicy palate and heavy body. This isnt an easy-drinking hefeweizen; its a wheat beer for the most discriminating of tastes.

APPEARANCE AND AROMA

Hopfen Weisse pours to a very hazy shade of dark gold/light orange as if it were butterscotch syrup. Its translucent with some carbonation apparent and the yeast, when added from the bottom of the bottle, gives a lava lamp effect. The beer produces a think collar of bright white, fluffy, marshmallow-like head. It is extremely slow to dissolve and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is rather potent with notes of citrus and some spice and touch of banana. The yeast is also prominent giving the beer a slightly dry scent. Alcohol is also noticeable as well.

TASTE

One of the reasons I like wheat beers is due to their refreshing palate. Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen Weisse is quite the opposite since its so complex and intense that its closer to a sipping beer. Immediately I received a strong flavor of pineapple and alcohol. It was followed by a mélange of spices and a sweet banana-like finish.

I really enjoyed the taste as I noticed a continually-evolving palate. The hops provided for bitterness while the yeast and malts combined for a creamy, caramel-like palate and soft mouthfeel. I really enjoyed the rich flavor, which was indeed intense but nothing I would honestly consider sweet. There is a spiciness which cannot be ignored and its what separates the beer from your more pedestrian hefeweizen. But by the same token its a very acquired taste to really enjoy and appreciate.

DRINKABILITY

Wheat beers are usually known for their light and sometimes watery body, but Hopfen Weisse is much the opposite. The mouthfeel is thick and heavy and has a creamy texture to it. Its soft on the palate and finishes extremely smooth, but the yeast leaves a dry, bitter aftertaste. This is one of those beers that are great to drink, but the aftertaste doesnt compliment the beers character as well.

WEIGHT

Since this beer is heavy in the mouth its also heavy in body. At 8.5% ABV, Hopfen Weisse is indeed a sipping beer rather than the lawnmower beers many wheat brews are known for. The alcohol is prominent in the palate, but the beer does not go to your head. However, I did feel very full after drinking just one glass of it. Since this only comes in a 750ml bottle, Id highly recommending splitting it with someone who will appreciate it.

FINAL THOUGHTS

I was actually surprised the Brooklyner-Schneider version of the Hopfen Weisse was so complex, rich and robust. I assumed it would have been a bit more pedestrian, so this brew caught me by surprise.

Not much going on in the mouth. White bread and malted wheat with notes of banana and spices. Grass and a gentle citric note. The mostly sweet flavor is accompanied with a slightly tart and sharp lemony tartness in the middle. The finish is quite bitter with some citric hop notes, phenols, lots of spices and an almost burning sensation of alcohol. The finish is actually not very good at all.

Very smooth texture, medium body going toward full. Gentle carbonation. This is the best aspect of the beer.

This is a decent beer, but considering the quality of the two brewers whos created it, its a bit of a letdown. The other version (Schneider-Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse) they created is way better. Although its tasty for the most part, it comes out as rather uneven and unbalanced, and the finish really ruined it for me.

11,"2009-11-12",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2010 Location: 750 ml bottle from Gillys, 11/12/09


Aroma: The aroma has some among other things: orange, clove, banana, and citrus

Flavor: Taste is a balanced (really well meshed) combination of wheat, fruit, malt and a hop backing

Palate: This one is quite smooth with a solid amount of body and a nice mouthfeel

11,"2009-09-02",4.3,"Pours a gorgeous cloudy golden yellow. Lots of beautiful foamy head. Really radiant, and yet so cloudy. Nearly flawless. 

Heavy scents of wheat and strong orange peel. Only a hint of banana. Sweet, but grounded by the thick yeast aroma. Very nice, esp for a hef. Not saccharine; balanced. 

A hoppy hef? This has the sweetness of the orange/banana on the hef part, but a final swallow of bitter grapefruit hops. The balance is an unusual welcome. Gorgeous hoppy aftertaste. Great for style. 

Thick and smooth, but a tad fizzy. Nice, bitter hop film. Its smooth, but has a lot more than the average hef. Really nice hops. Smooth but substantial. A uniquely excellent brew.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

In the mouth the beer has a fairly sweet makeup - honey, clove, orange and banana are immediately noticable. Finishes with some yeast and medium citrus bitterness/aftertaste. Medium body to full body, theres some wieght to it, but its nto sticky or syrupy. Alcohol is present, gently reminding you that youre having a weizenbock. The carbonation is not as strong as the visuals suggested. It is even and smooth/soft.

It had a very pleasent smell of both foam banana and hops. Also some yeast, passion fruit and other sweet fruits. Very nice!

The first thing I noticed after trying it was the high carbonation that clouded all the flavor in the beer. After whirling it around a bit and with less carbonation it was allot better. It had a flavor of foam banana, hops, yeast with a medium bitterness. The alcohol was hidden by the high carbonation but was soon noticable. Some chemical bitterness but not so bad, it was worse in the other version and one of the things that lowered the score a bit. This one also felt more balanced then the Garett Oliver version.

Malty undertones of toasted grains, crackers and dry toffee. I enjoy the nose; there is a lot of thing going on, still quite focused. Maybe just a bit too heavily spiced. Almost menthol and mint-like from time to time. The flavour is light to medium sweet, light to medium bitter and light acidic. Tones of light banana, grass, resin, orange peel, lime peel, palate-numbing fresh herbs, round wheat, dry honey and toffee. Clove, coriander and vanilla are also present. Well-hidden alcohol, there is only a slight warming touch on the finish. The mouthfeel is round and soft with a lively, medium carbonation.

Not as rich as I remember the German version. No parallell tasting here unfortunately. Mouthfeel is moussy, smooth, with phenolos in flavour, pretty much alcohol feel, with an alcohol bitterness. There are peaches and other unnameable exotic fruits in flavour and hints of vanilla. The thick, sticky weizenbock feel is in absense, due to the rich hoppying.

Appearance: It has a deep hazy orange colored body with lots of visible carbonation. The head is off white in color, tall, thick and creamy. The head is long lasting and makes lots of slick lacing on the glass.

Smell: It has a light pleasant aroma of wheat, a light wisp of clove, subtle fruity yeast and just a very subtle hint of smokiness.

Taste/Mouth Feel: The flavor starts with a big tangy wheat and grain base that adds fruity and spicy yeast notes of banana and clove as well as some citrus notes from the hops. The hops really stand out in the finish which becomes dry and has solid bitterness for the style. It has a full body and the texture is thick and chewy with a heavy well rounded mouth feel.

Nose was a very strong and noticeable mix of hops, spices (clove) and fruit, especially bananas. Mouthfeel is full and somewhat tingly, and the taste mirrors the nose, with the pleasant addition of the 8.5% alcohol as the beer warmed. This led to a finish that was slightly bitter, long lasting and very pleasant.

Pours a hazy goldish orangish, light hued, with big offwhite bubbly head, medium hazed, with a head that dies down somewhat.

Initial is light on the tounge, but definitely not a light beer. Flavors are wheaty malts and grains, balancing fruity esters (Banana, again, largely), belgian yeasty spice, amarillo hops with some grassy feels, and a nice creamy sweetness.

Spicy hop fireworks explode in citrusy and herbal colors atop crisp straw and bubblegum phenols in this highly endearing experiment à la Houblon Chouffe.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam protects the cloudy blond.
-The first words that came to mind to describe the aroma were ""holy"" and ""shit"".
-This remains very drinkable throughout.
-The hop signature is more intense than the Schneider-Brooklyner version, but works as well to my taste buds.
-The spicy, coniferous hop bitterness is classy.
-The mouthfeel is not as fluffy as that of the Houblon Chouffe, for example.
-Wheat contributes to the crispness and citrusy fruitiness.

11,"2008-10-16",4.3,"On their own, Brooklyn Brewery and Schneider-Sohn out of Germany are both amazing breweries so the idea and reality of the two teaming up to create a collaboration brew is enough to make any beer geeks heart tremble in excitement and their mouths water. Of course, the truth is in the bread, liquid bread in this case, and of course the Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen-Weisse does not disappoint.

After a pop of the cork, I poured my Hopfen-Weisse into my goblet and set to observing her seductive cloudy tangerine and orange depths. A thick head about 2 fingers thick sits pretty on top of the awaiting brew below, slowly slinking her way back into my glass. As she does so, delicate trails of brussels lace adorn the sides and a decent blanket lingers for the whole show. Her nose is orange, lots of freshly squeezed oranges followed by bitter grapefruit and lemon with a sour yeasty tang snapping at the end. A steady stream of bubbles screams their way to the top where they release an endless stream of tantalizing aromas. I go in for the first quaff, and then the second. True to the large majority of secondarily fermented beers, her body has an overall pleasantly light effervescence. Sour grapefruit and lemon grabs my tastebuds right off the bat and don’t let go. In the meanwhile, a more gentle and subtle array of soft chewy wheat and sweet orange mingle. Further on into my glass, a bit more piney hops and oils can be tasted amidst the grapefruit and lemon. Her palate softens a bit as she warms, and more of the bready wheat comes out to even the playing field. Overall, tart and yeasty, sweet and piney with a soft chewy finish.

Combining the American art form of bountiful hops and the German mastery of all things wheat, or weisse, the Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen-Weisse is their amazing love-child. Born of passion and expertise, if only all children were as brilliantly well-behaved as this one. Simply amazing.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

The head lasts throughout the entire experience.The aroma has some intense bouquets of orange rinds with some sweet notes of caramel and fruits. There are a lot of grassy notes and spices as well. The initial flavour is a blast of spices, grass, and hops. As the brew passes, a multitude of flavour assaults your palate. A balance of sweet rolls, caramel, hops, lemon, banana, orange, orange rind, spices, and grass all mingle together extremely well. Its pretty sweet, but the hops give it a nice balance so its not too sweet. The banana, caramel, and sweet roll flavours give it a nice roundness while the hops, lemon, orange, and orange rind give it some good sharpness. And the spices add a little more complexity. The finish is lightly bitter but is, overall, smooth and a little sweet. For a wheat beer, this is huge and complex.","California, USA","BossHossBikes"
11,"2008-09-24",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 25, 2008 In short: A fruity, sweet and hoppy wheat beer.  Hugely drinkable.
How: Bottle 750ml, consumed fresh a few days after purchase (side by side with sister Schneider & Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse)
The look: Cloudy dark yellow body topped by a medium off-white head
In long: Copy-and-paste of Schneider & Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse description that I had side by side.  About all of it applies to Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen-Weisse too.  Nose of lemon pie and toasted wheat.  Taste has a lot of hay, flavours of crusty pie, banana cake and lemon.  A little sugary.  Strong spicy hops presence, with dry bitterness and white pepper sensation.  Some dry herbs. Nice acidic touch in the finish.  Little to no alcohol presence.  Body is a little fluffy.  Carbonation is very aggressive/tickling and it suits the beer just fine.  Feeling of a sweetened Berliner Weisse on steroids.  Compared to Schneider & Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse: a stronger hop bite hides the residual sugar in the finish better.  A bit more wheaty and a touch of alfalfa sprouts.  Overall a little dryer than its German sister and a tiny bit more enjoyable.  Great beer.  Nice german influence at work here.  That cooperation with Brooklyn Brewery is a good example of Germany pushing forward their ideas on other countries, and its a much better approach than the one they took in the late 30s early 40s.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
11,"2008-09-21",3.6,"cloudy pale yellow.  aroma of some tropical fruit like its twin but mingled with floral hops.  taste follows suit -- short, dry fruitiness is followed with an IPA level dose of bitterness.  the bitterness is also ultra dry, no weizen mouthfeel here. slight yeast in nose is lost in the avalanche of hops on the tongue.  first tripel IPAs....now a weizen IPA?  this is a good, big beer. far from one dimensional but not nearly as complex as its twin, which i also thought was a much better representation (and interpretation) of a weizen bock.  alcohol lingers, burning on the throat, pleasantly.  somehow bitterness of this magnitude is more tolerable with the mouthfeel and other characteristics of an IIPA, it grows tiresome as this bottle goes on.  however, in the same time span the beer breathes and fruits become more apparent and enjoyable, leading to an eventual balance with the hops.  a very thought provoking brew.","River Grove, Illinois, USA","satan165"

Sweet apricot in there as well.  Palate is medium, mouth coating, with a high level of carbonation.  Aftertaste is long, with a bunch of hop bitterness. As it warms, the taste becomes very one dimensional towards the hops.  I will say one thing, the 8.5% ABV in this beer was masked exceptionally well.  Nice one, thanks Mark.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

11,"2008-09-05",3.6,"25 oz bottle, via Julio’s.  Pours a gold body with a slight haze.  Large frothy white head, vigorous carbonation.  Grassy hops and hay hit the nose first, then some yeast derived spiciness, bready malt, and honey.  The flavor is unusual to say the least.  The combo of heavy bready and wheat malt plus the floral and grassy hops create a unique and flavorful beer.  I’d like some more earthy yeastiness to balance the hops.  I’m getting a slightly odd minty note on the finish from the hops.  Rather alcoholic on the back end, which for some reason makes me think that it’s more apparent because of the lack of dark malts.  Mouthfeel is full and sturdy with just a little clingy doughy wheat and lots of efforvescent carbonation.  Overall, pretty nice, and a decent drinker, but I’m not totally sold on the pale Weizenbock style.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
11,"2008-09-01",3.9,"Bottle Number 0668; Sampled August 2008
A fairly careful pour into my 25cl tulip glass still produces a three-finger thick, pale tan colored head.  The head has a very fluffy texture to it and it leaves a nice amount of lacing on the sides of my glass.  The beer is a hazy, light amber hue that still shows a hazy, orange tinged, gold color when held up to the light.  The aroma is quite vibrantly spicy with hop notes, but is still quite obviously a Hefeweizen too.  Aromas of tropical fruit, ripe apricot and a spicy herbal note from the hops are backed by significant clove phenols as well as a touch of fruity banana that lies just underneath.  Other notes of lemon zest, pale-whole-grain cracker notes, and a fresh crushed wheat aroma.  I really like the mix of spicy notes that come from both the Palisade hops and the fermentation character; huge woody pepper aromatics, perhaps a touch of sweet pickled ginger, a touch rosemary / menthol.

Fairly sweet tasting, but much of this is accentuated by the fruity hop character that provides notes of bergamot, apricot and lots of tangelo.  The ample hop flavors that are packed into this beer also provide flavors of minty pine, light herbal notes and a significant, herbal leaning bitterness.  In the flavor the hop character is a lot more noticeable than it was in the aroma; how this is really manifest is that the Weizen flavors are a bit muted under the hop character.  Traditional Weizen notes of clove are certainly the most prominent, but there is also a nice fresh wheat character that both adds texture and flavor, a touch of tartness typical of the style can also be noticed and there is just a hint of banana that seems to be noticeable in the lingering finish.  This is quite well carbonated, but the viscous body does a good job of hiding this fact; really though the ample carbonation does a good job of balancing out the medium-heft that this beer has, such that this remains fairly quaffable (the hop character also seems to help with this too).  This can get a little hot in the finish at times with a mix of spicy phenolics and higher alcohols, but it doesn’t seem to detract too much.

Quite tasty and I really like the vibrant hop character, despite it drowning out the yeast character a bit.  This certainly retains the refreshing wheat character that is typical of a Hefeweizen; speaking of which, I really do see this as more of a strong Hefeweizen than a Weizenbock, as I usually associate that last with being darker and richer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Light citris and wheat notes.  Some peaches and spicy yeast.  Color is a hazy brownish orange.  Zippy and lively in the mouth.  Good bitterness up front that melds into some sweet malty notes in the middle.  Light roastyness with plenty of spicy, yeasty notes.  Pepper and corriander with a bit of orange.

Poured a volcanically effervescent golden with a fizzy frothy white head that lasted quite a while.  Aroma of sharp grass and pine hops, overshadowing the yeast esters so much that I found the ensuing taste rather surprising.  Flavors are of course the bitter and grassy hoppiness, but the banana and clove yeast esters make their way into the palate towards the finish.  The marriage of the two flavors is quite refreshing, and endears a hophead like myself even more to this style.

Smell: Notably spicy upfront with a strong, redolent scent of allspice, along with notes of clove and nutmeg. Plus, a spicy, tropical hop character. Sweetish wheat component. Tons of fruitiness coming and going.

Taste: Malted wheat and barley blended with sweetened banana juice and chewing gum. Fair amount of spice and a generous addition of tropical fruit. Dash of peach schnapps. Growing wheat tanginess upon warming. Slight grassiness. A cereal sweetness that comes and goes, as does a tickle of acidity. Citrusy, spicy hop character with a medium bitterness.

First Impression: The !@#$%^ thing is a gusher. Let me think about how much this cost as I clean it up off my keyboard.  Aroma is almost purely hops and alcohol, with a fruit undertone. Visuals are a thick wheaty cloud with little to no head. Taste is absolutely delicious - hoppy, banana, apple, peach, and a great deep finish. Palate is a long bitter finish and a crisp, dry palate. Second Impression - I just wish the damn thing didnt spray all over. I cant stand gushers, especially when they are expensive, and it seems like they are always expensive.

11,"2008-07-04",3.9,"High quality big wheat beer.  Beautiful hazy caramel gold color and strong wheat and booze nose.  Nice.  Taste is slightly astringent, may need some time to mellow in the bottle?  Not your normal ""summer"" wheat.  This one would warm up most Munich winter nights.","Madrid, SPAIN","CamdenD"
11,"2008-06-30",4.0,"(Draught)  Pours a cloudy golden body with medium-sized off-white head.  Aroma of citrus, clove, banana, bubblegum, light florals, and toasted grain.  Flavor of banana, clove, caramel malt, and wheat.  Exceptional!","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
11,"2008-06-29",3.9,"Large white head. The first smell that hits you is hops. Amber color. Good balanced carbonation. Complex taste. Hints fruits and spice, cloves.

11,"2008-06-28",4.2,"This beer poured very dark and had a lot of whole hop petals floating in it.  It was very strong in hop aroma.  This beer had head retention like only Guiness can rival.  This beer was truly unlike any beer I have ever tasted.  This is a must for hop lovers and Hefeweizen lovers alike.  This beer at first was almost only hop flavor, but by the end of the glass it was clear that the dry hops blended very well with the Hefeweizen","Arizona, USA","daddyslick"
11,"2008-06-28",3.5,"pours a almost amber colour with a good head and strong orange with a light hint of hops and flowers aroma. taste of light orange and banana and a nice sweetness but not overbearing. very enjoyable nice","British Columbia, CANADA","JHunter"
11,"2008-06-28",4.2,"On tap in Blowing Rock, NC. Perfect color. Aroma is big on the hops. Fruity, nutty and spicy aroma. Complex to say the least. Initial sip is smooth. German flare: Banana and clove, but not coyingly sweet. Balance by the nuttiness and bite from the hops. The wheaty malt backbone rears its head and the dry, clean finish brings it home. No reason to elaborate further. This beer is a winner and I wish it was still around these here parts yall....","Blowing Rock, North Carolina, USA","BleacherBum"

11,"2008-06-28",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2009 750 bottle corked and caged opened with a loud pop. poured into a weizen glass has a yellow golden hazy color and fairly hefty carbonation. the smell of the sweet dry hops  is apparent as it was being poured. schneider banana yeast, honey, aromatic citrus hops, grass, clove, a hit of mango, and pepper. mouth feel is medium but has a great texture. flavor starts peppery, then moves to a banana yeast with floral, honey sweetness, malt, and fantastic hops. the schneider trademark yeast really shines against the wheat and hops side. spiced just right and finishes with sweetness and then turns dry with hop spice and a long duration. lots of flavors to keep your interest, nicely done bottle design, and a quality cork.","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"

11,"2008-06-26",3.7,"Bottle. Big fluffy white head and loads of carbonation, befitting the style. The spicy hops nearly overwhelm the banana esters in the nose, but not quite. Light orange body. Rather dry body, mild bitterness, some hop aromatics come out in the finish.","Buffalo, New York, USA","estoppel"
11,"2008-06-26",3.6,"From a 750 ml bottle. Hazy dark amber to orange colored body with a thick, lightly off white head. The aroma is like banana peels with some paper sacks and peaches. There is also a little bit of medicinal quality, but it complements the brew. The taste is strong banana peels with some cloves. There are also some light toasted bread notes. A strange mango type fruit finish is a little off putting. An obviously bigger beer, this still drinks pretty easily. However, the flavors are definitely made for those that like their tropical fruti mixed with the typical hefe flavors. Its ok, but I would like a more prominent malt backbone.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
11,"2008-06-25",3.9,"Thanks to Blake for opening this!  Poured hazy paler golden with a fluffy and sticky cap of white head.  The aroma picked up sweeter cat pee and floral hoppage over toasted bananas and lighter fruits.. remarkably well balanced.  The flavor had toffee and light fruity sweetness supporting quite vibrant floral and grapefruit bitterness.. banana and more of the hops on the back-end.. spicy, warm finish.  Heavier-bodied with high carbonation on the palate.. warm on the edges with an estery finish.  Excellent!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
11,"2008-06-25",3.8,"Bottle.  The beer pours to a murky pale straw colored body with a nice coating white head.  The aroma is quite hoppy.  Very fruity pineapple/starfruit and yeast with lots of wheat.  The flavor is really wheat laden with some toffee and starfruit.  The palate is not as textured as Id have thought.  The hops burp up pretty well however.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
11,"2008-06-24",3.8,"hazy like a humid saturday afternoon, orange-gold in color. playfully alcohol on the nose, with banana and spices to keep things interesting. spicy, sweet, citurs, bitterness, and other stuff too. this is a complex beer that demands your attention. goes great with vietnamese bun and spring rolls.","robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","pepperford"
11,"2008-06-22",3.9,"Bottle.  True brown and caramel with a lively head.  Strong identifiable aromas of orange peel, clove, coriander, wild yeast and sandalwood.  Predominant flavors are heightened by the alcohol in the beer.  Theres an interesting grapey center to the beer, which then finishes dry and yeasty.  Substantial hop presence and lots of sharp fruit.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","jefcon"
11,"2008-06-22",4.5,"Last year I had the Schneider version of the beer, and this year I decided to try the Brooklyn version instead.  The bigger bottle filled domestically was corked and caged, and had embossed lettering below the neck to give a very classy presentation.  When opened, the aroma of fresh hops assaulted me before the pour even began.  The body in a Weizen glass was golden in color and the head was three finger tall and foamy.  As good as it looked, the smell out of the glass was intoxicating.  The hops were obvious at an arms length, but as I drew it closer, the banana, clove, and orange smells almost overpowered them.  The taste was richly layers with the Weizen roots providing a fruity, phenolic base, on top of which hop cones were piled on.  This was a superlative assault on my taste buds from all directions.  The body was medium thick, yet fluffy, and every sip had a long lingering aftertaste showcasing all of the flavor elements.  Drinkability is off the charts good.  I am now kicking myself for only having bought one bomber.  It would be interesting to pick up this one together with the German bottling, and do a horizontal.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
11,"2008-06-21",3.9,"750 ml bottle courtesy of Blake.  Lovely hop aroma and a nice cloudy and frothy pour.  Good American take on this recipe.  Wonderful hop aroma with a nice blending of esters.  Very interesting.  More piney than the other version.  More of an emphasis overall on the hop profile.  Slightly out of balance in favour of the hop character.  Pleasant mouthfeel and dry finish.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"
11,"2008-06-21",4.6,"750ml caged&corked bottle. Pours a deep, cloudy, glowing orange gold with a very thick, though short-lived, white head that never dissipates completely and leaves a few strings and spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is a big whiff of fresh hop leaves - citrus and freshly-mown grass. After your nose gets through the hops, there are spicy phenolic aromas (allspice), subtle fruit (plums, peaches), and a subtle sweet malt aroma. The flavor starts in a very complex fashion: alcohol, grassy hops, chewy malted wheat, and spices. Fruitiness and funkiness grow as the beer ventures towards mid-tongue. Hop bitterness also grows. The finish is somewhat dry, bitter from both hops and ethanol, and very complex with fruity esters and spicy phenols. The mouthfeel is luxurious - creamy, sudsy and soft, full-bodied, and densely carbonated. Overall, an absolutely awesome beer. I dont think weizenbock, however, is a remotely suitable appellation. More like an American Strong Ale (tastes more like a Belgian Strong Ale thanks to the funk from the Schneider yeast). Regardless of style, this beer is awesome - a total home run (and it comes only one day after the last home run I tasted: Allagash Hugh Mallone...)","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"
11,"2008-06-21",4.5,"My brother in law got me a bottle of this for my 30th birthday, wow! Knock your socks off beer.  It opens taste buds that I never experienced with wheat beer previously.  A little bit banana, a bit robust hop, a bit citrus, a lot of great! Highly recommended!","http://westchesterbeer.com, USA","DeadGuyFrank"
11,"2008-06-21",3.9,"750ml bottle. 2008 release. this is my congratulations for finishing grad school brew!! pours hazy golden-auburn with foamy white head. a nice big floral hop aroma, banana, citrus, cloves, citrus. and spicy. wonderful nose. flavors are citrusy, banana, a bit grassy with  peppery, clovey finish. full mouth feel with lively carbonation. i think i prefer the hop profile of this over the schneider-brooklyner version. the hopped up hefes are great.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
11,"2008-06-18",3.9,"Bottle; poured a ruddy orange with a big of white head.  Lasted quite a long time.  The aroma was amazing; flowers and citrus with banana/bubblegum complimenting it; a touch of sweetness.  Flavor was good, but not quite as good as the aroma.  A nice balance of banana, spice and hops.  Very hoppy for the style.  eally easy to drink, luckily its not overly alcoholic.  Would have liked some more banana in the flavor.  Overall, the aroma stole the show a bit.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"
11,"2008-06-18",4.4,"Opens with a pop and a puff of smoke!  Great pour, deep dark golden orange with so many tiny bubbles and a HUGE creamy off-white froth that sticks around forever.  Wow, great aroma, sooo hoppy, spicy, banana, clove... fantastic! Tried to take a sip and it left white suds all over my nose and upper lip!  Its says 7.8% however my bottle says 8.5.   Im inclined to think 7.8 as it is way less hot and more manageable than the Schneider-Brooklyner.   The stronger hop character and better wheat/barley malt ratio really balance and fill it out.  Sweet and sticky, medium body, but still fluffy and very drinkable.  Long juicy hop finish, very rich.  Some butterscotch and orange peel. $%*$*Q(%@ sooo good!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"
11,"2008-06-16",4.0,"Im a huge fan of this. Its got the hefeweizen yeasty and wheaty flavors and aromas, but then it has a really neat hop aroma and flavor that you dont usually get in hefeweizens or weizen bocks. I really like this. Awesome.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
11,"2008-06-15",2.6,"Bottle. Pours very cloudy and lively, huge foamy white head. I sense more hefeweizen banana and clove in the aroma than I do hops prior to the first drink. The hop aroma builds as thedrinking begins. I really wanted to like this beer, hops and wheat can coexist if done correctly, FFF Gumballhead is a great example. This beer, however, seems to miss the mark to me. The wheaty funky wanginess just doent quite jive with the hop presence. Maybe it was the choice of hops used. I dont know, but I do know that it just didnt get it done for me.","Centerville, Ohio, USA","clingman71"
11,"2008-06-15",3.5,"Draft. Pours with a large head, gold yellow, lots more hops than fruity weizy sweetnes..","New York, USA","Maverick34"
11,"2008-06-14",3.8,"Pour was typical of a hefe, huge-mongo head, standard cloudy golden-yellow body. Aroma was floral perfumey, good hop and phenolic balance, bananas take a major back seat, but still there. Flavor follows suit, an enjoyable brew, although Id like a simpler cleaner hefe on any given day of the Summer. Honestly, this was quite similar to the Schneider-brewed version, imo, not sure why it gets another entry just for location of brew. Ah well, all good.","","User37895"
11,"2008-06-14",4.7,"Swirling, tempestuous activity in a Schneider Edel-Weisse glass... bright yellow brown body with a massive four-finger head--picture perfect... thick, uneven foam is left as tracing... the citrus and banana aromas are compounded by the spruce and pine accents... this promises to be complex and refreshing, if the smell is accurate...medium to full-bodied, light on the tongue but warm on the throat... the head softensits impact... a grainy texture is also noticeable by the third sip... unexpectedly, the combination of killer hops and mega wheat neither nullify nor mutate, but become congruous and  complimentary in a delicious marigae... perhaps this one was a winner before the bottle hissed open, but with two brilliant breweries joining forces, the results are predictable and impeccable... cheers.","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"
11,"2008-06-14",3.7,"Cool looking corked and caged 750.  Muddy orange with active carb and a big, sticky meringue head that collapses leaving chunks.  Nose is pine, juniper, wheat, banana and clove-coriander.  While the aroma worked for me, the taste doesnt quite come together.  Resin cuts through the wheaty smoothness.  Taste is spruce and caramel but quickly gin.  Hot peppery finish.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"

11,"2008-06-13",4.2,"On tap @ Galaxy Global Eatery in NYC. Cloudy orangey yellow color with a fluffy white head. Complex aroma of yeast, wheat and lemon. Each sip had a different flavor: wheat, banana, lemon, etc etc. Really great beer.","Connecticut, USA","joebudzjoe"
11,"2008-06-13",3.8,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle.  Sunny, hazed bright yellow appearance.  Grayish.  Pear, apricot and pine hoppy aroma.  Pungent garlic sweetness.  Clove, vanilla, and banana wheat characters.  Fresh and prickly bitterness with no weight of alcohol.  Flavor is similarly hoppy, bright and fruity, smoothened by a pleasant creamy sweetness of banana and distant soy milk; pine-like bitterness is punchy but alternately very soft and kind.  Some alcohol touch with vanilla traces sweetening.  Medium body is smooth, silky, and bittersweet with light effervescence; finishes with some hoppy length and a papery dryness.  Fresh and calming.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
11,"2008-06-12",3.4,"Bottle, compared at the same time as the schneider version.  Pours a hazy medium-dark-straw color with huge white head that lasts longer than the german version.  Great lacing.  Amazing nose of lemon and wheat, without other distracting aromas.  Clove, banana, lemon notes in flavor.  Cloying semi-bitter finish, but nicer than the german version.  Final verdict, Brooklyn brewed the better version.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Butters"
11,"2008-06-12",3.1,"Thanks to Stine for sharing.  Bottle, pours a pale, cloudy yellow body with yellowish white head.  Spicy aroma of grassy hops with a hint of citrus.  Mostly wheat flavor with lemon, grass, and yeast tones.  Clean finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","zeke626"

A lot of wheat flavors and dry grass.  The hops seem to be covering up the banana and clove flavors from the yeast.  Good, but I think I like the Schneider version better.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
11,"2008-06-12",3.9,"Sampled from 750 ml bottle supplied by Stine. Pours a hazy dark straw brew with a thick white head that slowly dissipates to a creamy head with some good lacing. Aroma of fruity and citrus hops, some vanilla, banana and a touch of cloves. Taste is smooth, creamy with a hoppy white bread with wheat malt flavor. Finish has a mild bitterness with a light citrus zest and hop aftertaste. A little hoppy for a Weisen bock but very enjoyable.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
11,"2008-06-10",4.0,"750 ml bottle/ Poured a dark cloudy amber. Aroma was very hoppy, almost like an ipa. Mouthful was very smooth, and nicely carbonated. I found this beer to a nice depth to it as it has different levels of flavor. Going down I sense some sweetness, and then the finish has some nice bitterness to it. Very enjoyable, and very nice beer.","jericho, New York, USA","TeamTrappist"
11,"2008-06-10",4.2,"Orange-gold. Gigantic head. Smells exactly as I expected, which is awesome. Lots of American hops which work very well with the soft banana and sharp clove. The flavor starts off dominated by hefeweizen--big, rich hefeweizen with spices, fruit, and citrus. Then come the citrus-thick American hops, first blending almost perfectly then taking over completely. A touch of wheat comes back after the swallow. Very impressive beer.","Winchester, Virginia, USA","jmuhops"

11,"2008-06-09",3.7,"750 ml bottle (the first 750 of a German-style beer Ive seen?) from Richmond Beverage in Richmond, VT (May 2008) served near cellar temperature once the head finally dissipated from a Ramstein glass, after an entire bottle of wine and a big shot of bourbon, so this reivew is gonna suck.  Bite me.  Pours a hazy dull brass-bronze with a massive gout of head that refuses to disappear for several minutes living a bit of chunky lacing as it finally dies....thick caramelized bananas in the nose, light spices, vanilla syrup and a bit of bourbon, very sweet.....full and luscious mouthfeel, lightly alcoholic, quite malty and rich with caramelization dominant, a bit of woody bitterness towards the finish, little in the way of wheaty tartness though its there if you look for it, particularly at the end when its warmed a bit....not a patch on Plank or Alesmith, but eminently drinkable, if a bit pretentious and pricey in its packaging.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
11,"2008-06-09",3.9,"Pours a hazy straw color with nice dense and long lasting white/yellow head.  Citrusy/floral aroma, quite strong actually, but pleasant.

11,"2008-06-09",3.6,".5l brown bottle served in a Schneider Hefe glass. Poured a hazy gold. Huge head, lots of carbonation. Bottle conditioned. Fresh, citrusy American hop aroma. I didnt get any banana or clove like a typical hefe. There is some alcohol in the aroma. It has a very unique aroma.
There is a lot of malt here. Nice mouthfeel with some bready flavors. A good amount of hop bitterness with a very dry finish. The alcohol is very evident.
I wonder if they used the typical Schneider hefe yeast in this one. An interesting melding of two brewing traditions.","De Soto, Kansas, USA","HomeBrewHawk"
11,"2008-06-09",3.2,"Bottle... Lightly hazed yellow ale with a huge, wispy, white head. Excellent retention. The aroma is very phenolic with tons of clove and light mesquite smoke. Esters include, but are not limited to, overripe banana. I cant figure out the rest. Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and modest carbonation. Sweet up front, followed by moderate bitterness, with light tanginess carrying up the rear. Spicy and citric. Lengthy, bitter, tangy finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

11,"2008-06-09",3.6,"750ml. bottle. Cloudy golden/yellow color with a large white head. Initial sniff brought nothing but bubblegum. Additional whiffs brought out some clove and C-hops as well as a hint of banana. Flavor once again started out being dominated by bubblegum, which almost kept me from finishing my half of the bottle. After the first 4 or 5 sips, a bit of banana emerged, along with some nice hop bitterness. Very aggressive carbonation. Nice and thirst quenching since it was sampled on a hot 95 degree day. I am glad I didnt stop after only a few ounces as this beer got much better the more I drank.","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","jimmack"

11,"2008-06-06",4.0,"Thanks mcbackus.  What a beautiful bottle!  It makes for a great presentation.  Pours a nice cloudy golden hue with a huge white head that just will not subside.  Big musty aroma of clove, , and lemon.  Some hop, as well.  Like the aroma, the flavor is also big and distinct.  It is full of yeast, earth, hop, tart fruit, and alcohol.  The hop has the dry effect that provides a nice bite to the beer.  This offers many of the best traits of a dry hopped APA mixed with the best hefe notes.  It sends the palate all over the place hitting all the right spots.  It arrives in the mouth as a hefe, jumps into a dry hopped APA, and finally dry bitterness cascades in.  Delightful,  interesting, and delicious.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
11,"2008-06-03",4.0,"Pours a cloudy golden orange with a substantial off-white head that retains well. The banana-clove complex is paired beautifully with tropical citrus, aromatic yeast and hop resin in the nose. The flavour is crisp, yet robust and is ripe with wheat, clove, pear, mango and bitter, floral hop flavours. The hoppiness paired with the typical wheat flavours is very intriging. It finishes very dry with surprisingly long palate duration. It has a well matched medium body with effervescent carbonation.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Drink4Satan"

 uniquely delightful treat.","TAIWAN","mephisto"

Good head retention. Light to medium body.","Norwood, Massachusetts, USA","Alldaydrinker"

Initially the flavor is nice and tart with lemon and clove with the hops finishing it off. I like how you only get the hop bitterness when you have the beer in your mouth, but after it fades away and all you can taste is clove on your palate. It is a nice and refreshing beer made with quality ingredients.","Bristol, Rhode Island, USA","emerica56"

This beer is so well balanced and just down right tasty. The Amarillo and Palisade hops were a perfect compliment to the yeast phenols and wheat. A very tasty brew.","Florida, USA","afterglow"

Aromas are heavy on caramel and overly ripe bananas, with a hefty spice billing that includes cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon.  Though its on the sweet side, the nose is pretty inviting.  Flavors do not disappoint, basically continuing the theme of spiced bananas and caramel, with perhaps a touch of rum cake thrown in for good measure.  I can imagine some nice dessert pairings for this beer (bananas foster, perhaps, or maybe some vanilla bean crepes).  The medium-full, sweet body skirts the line of being cloying.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer.  Nice collaboration here.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Simply gorgeous. the first whiff reveals dramatic differences between this and the version produced at Schneider, in Germany. The aroma introduces vibrant esters, lush hops and loads of banana and almost as many pineapple scents. Alcohol is almost entirely disguised. Minor toasted grain is supplanted by so much fruit it seems like it was kegged ten minutes ago and didnt have a chance to settle or allow flavor integration at all. The flavor starts with just far too much pineapple taste from the wheat malt and yeast collaboration. Spice is nice, especially in the finish, where wheat and hop bitterness release earth-tonation. Alcohol warmth is notably higher than that of a typical weizenbock. Pine notes embrace soft bitterness. Sweetness is mild and well placed throughout. Lemon pokes through late in each sip. Acidity is flushed away in the finish by sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium-full, boisterously carbonated and lively. Very good, but I prefer the other version of this.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

11,"2007-10-19",3.9,"Draft at Zenos.  Honestly I didnt see much of a difference between this and the first version.  Perhaps the hops were toned down, but they both came off as huge, high gravity wheat beers.  Nose of honey, lemon and fruit, with heavy spices and white pepper.  Palate is also peppery and prickly, with a medium level of tartness.  Almost boozy sometimes.  Good, but again, not really different from the first version.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

11,"2007-10-15",4.0,"On tap at Zenos Pub - State College, PA. Gentle, blossoming aroma with figs, asian pear, banana cream and almond bits. Curbed with a tangy edge of plant material. A mid-clouded deep straw-gold, with a rocky white foam above. Flavor flows forth with rich, resplendent qualities. Theres a bright, fresh, sweet sugar, clean and alive. Banana flesh mingles in with a sudden burst of hops, that just work so well with the phenolics of the style. These wild, tangly high hops play off the active, bubbly esters and phenols for a fun interplay of mid-colored fruits, chesnuts and candy. This mix brews a certain note of spicy, sweet olive flesh, cured well and nostril pleasing. Backs out with fresh, clean yeast flavor and a delectable smack of lemon and currant hops. Juicy, vibrant and perfectly brewed. Alcohol only adding complexity and depth. Really well attenuated for no stickiness and refreshing dryness. Maybe paler and not nearly as caramelized as I would expect from the style in that manner, but so brilliant in balance, build and execution. Plays more like an Imperial Hefe. Great stuff!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

The flavor is pretty creamy on the palate.  Very spicy taste, almost overdone in my opinion.  Didnt really get much of the clove or banana I usually do in this style, but was just attacked by peppery spice.  Definitely needed more balance to it, and certainly maybe some more bock characters as well, if this is what they are classifying it as.

11,"2007-10-06",4.1,"Growler - hazy light gold beer, with a soapy, large-bubbled head - the aroma explodes with american hops, but once your nose adjusts, there are complex notes of clove, lemon, and strong herbal notes (mostly thyme and rosemary) - the flavor progresses in much the same way - strong, pine and citrus american hop flavors up front, coupling well with your standard wheat beer flavors - then, more complex notes of thyme, lime leaves, peppery qualities - light sweetness near the finish, with some pineapple and orange - herbal notes and hop bitterness linger in the finish - the alcohol becomes a bit too apparent at the end, but the warming character it brings fits the herbal qualities of the beer - a very unique and tasty brew, with a bit more ""character"" than its companion.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
11,"2007-10-06",3.4,"UPDATED: OCT 7, 2007 Draught at Dunedin Brewery. Glad to have a chance to sample this one. Light bodied wheat pour, small off white head. Nose is like an Abbey Tripel, huge notes of fusel alcohol, cloves, black pepper, lemons, piney hops and other assorted spices. Not really a fan of Tripels at all so this one is a bit off-putting to me. Flavor is very similar, huge clove and peppery spice. Finish is very lengthy, the best part of the beer.

11,"2007-10-04",3.8,"Draught tulip at Sunset Grill on 9/25/07Thin, but dense off-white head is well-retained, leaving light lacing.  Medium clarity in this peachy-gold colored beer, with ample carbonation.Tremendously hoppy nose is full of lush grass and herbs, with almost an afterthought of very light pine.  Some minor tropical fruit notes can be found too.  Though its quite dominant in aroma (and flavor), I cant deny its very enjoyable.  Add to this the soft banana, mild wheat and medium-dry toffee notes that break through, and youve got some type of German IPA, you might say.  With each sniff, I get something different, sometimes lemon/lime, sometimes hickory nuts, sometimes pineapple or even cherries.  The well-attenuated malts allow the hops room to roam, but you can sense a solid backbone of pale malts and only light medium malts (toffee, as mentioned).  Medium-high strength of aroma, with no flaws or alcohol.Just as vividly hoppy in flavor, though, with a superb maltiness that manages to provide both a soft, supple body and balance to the (low) bitterness of the hops.  Not much balance is needed, because theyre mostly finishing hops, thankfully, though there is a moderate lemony punch on the finish from the acidity.  Creamy wheat and vanilla/honey-like pale malts work perfectly with the succulently grassy, fruity, juicy hops.  Mild carbonation, but enough to boost the drinkability.  Very good, much more focused/cohesive than its counterpart (though I need to try that one again).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Pours a cloudy gold with a magnificent head. The aroma is spicy, green, and grassy. Banana, citrus, and deep leafy, grassy scents tantalize my senses. Hm, I take a sip and find loads of fresh, fruity, juicy flavors. This is a delightful thirst quencher with depth and a huge amount of orange, melon, and leafy flavors. I reluctantly say that I enjoyed the prior recipe more with the Hallertau because it had more sharpness and a dryer finish. . . and dare I say it was more hoppy?

Strong aroma of lemons, wheat, some banana, and cloves.  The lemon citrus was less noticeable in the flavor, while the wheat and cloves were more pronounced.

Light malt with classic clove and pepper taste, but citric hop on the finish.

Flavor up front was mostly bright grapefruity, definitely American hops.  Underneath was off-sweet bready/biscuity malts with some melony fruitiness.  With due time, the flavor becomes something akin to a hoppy ""Juicyfruit"" gum. For comparison purposes, the German-made version seemed to have had way more complexity in spice and body.

Very cloudy yellow pour with a thick sticky white head.  Aroma is very sweet and bubble gummy.  Orange peel, coriander and a light lemon balm aroma as well.  It is significantly less tropical and fruity than I recall the initial one being.  Flavour is loaded with orange/lemon peel, but the spiciness is significantly less as well.  Hops are quite different and less punchy.  The flavour is sort of sweet and a little bit saccharine-like.  In a way it reminds me of some of the crappy citrus flavours witbiers (Leinenkugels comes to mind).  Low bitterness and a long sticky finish.

Tap at Blind Tiger.  Cant believe Im the first to rate this one.  Very hazy yellow colour.  Less brown/green than the Schneider-brewed version.  Creamy white head.  The aroma is very fruity and herbal.  Soft clove, herbal dry hops and loads of the perfumey yeasty character that I recall from the original.  There is also a beautiful tangerine/orange/mango that plays beautifully with the clove and light banana/apricot from the yeast.  Much less herbal than the German version with that character replace by citrus.  Despite the differences, its amazing how similar these two beers are to one another... the yeast really shows its personality in both of these brews.  Loads of wheat flavour as it should be along with a light floral note.  Very fruity with light resinousness/herbal notes.  Juicy and very tasty.  I think this beer is better integrated than the German version, but the German version is just so much stranger that I give it the nod.  I wouldnt complain about drinking either of them though.
