1663,"2014-08-29",3.8,"Every brewpub has to have a signature beer, this could be the one for The Library. Dark and smoky, bitter and biting, black as engine oil and just as slick. Hints of dark chocolate and espresso. A sipper for sure.","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"

Strongly roasted body with coffee beans and cocoa, presenting with a firm bite and bitterness. Stronger than most dry stouts and quite tasty.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
1663,"2010-07-15",3.6,"On tap at the Library. The best of their beers I tasted. Dark black with a mocha colored head. Not much aroma to it, but very full roasted flavor, a nice dry finish to it.","Mount Vernon, Iowa, USA","GJF"
1663,"2009-12-05",4.0,"Part of a sampler at the Library in Houghton after 4 days sailing on Lakes Michigan and Superior, and being pounded off Superior. Happy to have a beer. Never-the-less, this was a very good beer.  Coffee, roasted malt, burnt maple, all in a drinkable package. I wish I had one right now.","Minnesota, USA","EHopper"
1663,"2009-07-03",3.5,"On draught at the brewpub in downtown Houghton, Northern Michigan. Pours an opaque dark brown colored brew with a thin beige head that quickly dissipates to a thin off-white head and some spotty lacing. Aroma of toasted dark malt, a touch of chocolate and some grassy hops. Taste is medium bodied, very low carbonation with flavors of toasted dark malt, some chocolate, coffee and some grassy hops. Finish has a lingering toasted dark malt and grassy hop aftertaste. Still, a pretty solid dry stout.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1663,"2008-06-29",3.5,"On tap at the brewpub.  Dark dark brownish black with a fine light tan creamy head.  Lightly milky creamy, chocolate.  Lightly sweet roast.  Subdued.  Creamy mouthfeel, smaller bubbles.  Sweeter roast.  Nondescript, slight chocolate.  Some floral hops and acidity lingering.   Reminds me of a buddys homebrew clone of Sierra Nevada Stout.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"
1663,"2007-08-28",2.9,"A very dark brown color with only lacing for a head.  A nice roasted aroma and taste.  A grassy hop aroma and taste also that leaves a bitter aftertaste.  Did nothing for me.  There are better examples at this brewpub.","Ohio, USA","redlem"
1663,"2006-09-15",3.7,"5 oz draught sample at the brewpub, late July 2006.   A dark touch of head lasts for the whole 10-sample tasting (and its not nitro!) atop the thick jet body....big bitter chocolate-espresso nose, hugely roasty and dripping with character.....doesnt hold up as well on the tongue, the bittersweet chocolate is just a bit weak and lacking in the complexity the nose hoped for....milky-smooth mouthfeel is pleasant, but somehow this didnt quite deliver.  Still a pretty nice rendition.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1663,"2006-07-08",4.0,"On tap at the brewpub.  Pours a deep brown color of rich melted dark chocolate.  The aroma is rich and succulent, dripping with dark belgian chocolate and medium roast coffee maltiness.  Some vanilla and light oak tones are notes as well.  The flavor is incredibly full bodied, making this especially remarkable if the above denoted ABV of 5% is accurate.  There is a lot of flavor and texture packed into 5%.  Great balance between the rich toasty flavors and the dry finish.  A subtle deep fruity flavor of roasted prune livens up the smokey, woody malt profile.  Delicious, incredibly rich example of the style.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
1663,"2005-08-23",4.0,"on draft at the brewery.  wow, this is better than i expected it.  most small-time stouts are middle-of-the-road at best, usually falsely nitrogenated, and bland despite some roast.  this is quite an enjoyable stout, however, and easily the better of the few brews i had at the Library.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
1663,"2005-04-12",4.0,"Black Coloring with Tan Head  Heavy Roasts on the Nose.  Carried Through on the Tongue..Heavy Mouthfeel and Dry Aftertaste.  Solid Malt in the Background.  An All Out Fabulous Coffee Roast Malt.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
1663,"2005-04-07",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 23, 2011 Another glorious Michigan growler from CharlesDarwin!  Huzzah!  Black color with a very thin head.  Mmmm... big coffee and roasted malts in the aroma.  Woah!  If they were milling for my nose, they amassed an army to fight my tastebuds!  The coffee turns to espresso roasts in the flavor and heavily roasted malt borders on burnt without actually going there.  A little smoke and wood, but thats probably leftover from the malts.  A damn fine stout.  I just wish I didnt have to share with my friends... 8/4/8/4/17

Re-rating, June 15, 2011. Yeah, this has changed.  Black color with a small head.  Light coffee aroma.  Dark chocolate flavor.  Chalky feel.  A bit of molasses after warming.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
1663,"2005-03-23",4.0,"Deep black tar pour with a deep rich frothy brown head, slightly diminished. Rich meaty savory aromas. EXTREMELY toasty flavors full of coffee, chocolate, burnt cherries and sweet pipe tobacco. Finishes dry, but smooth with a touch of hazlenuts. An extremely rich and astounding brew.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
