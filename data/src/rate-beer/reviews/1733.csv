1733,"2016-09-27",3.7,"Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, wheat, Weizen yeast, banana, orange, citrus and spices.

Appearance:

Turbid golden/amber beer with a slight/medium white/off-white head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, wheat, Weizen yeast, banana and orange; ends slightly bitter and dry with citrus and spices.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. More intense than regular Hefeweizens, but the palate could have been less fizzy and thus smoother. Amazingly refreshing with a great balance between an old-fashioned beer style and the newer ones.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"
