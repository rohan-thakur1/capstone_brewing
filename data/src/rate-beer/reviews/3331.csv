The flavor reveals notes of sourdough pretzels and grapefruit.? The crisp, wheaty taste is quite nice on a warm spring day. The finish very clean, with little alcohol residual.

3331,"2017-05-08",3.9,"Bought as a four-pack of 16floz cans for $6.50, there is no freshness found on this particular can. This traditional lager is very light and in color with clarity and has good foam retention. Nose possesses that wet grass and dirt aroma characteristic for the style. Sometimes when I have this beer it will come off a bit skunky, even though it is perfectly fresh. Palate is medium, yet full of mineral and fibrous flavors that is suitable for those times when you want a gritty golden lager.","","balloonbuffoon"

3331,"2017-04-21",3.6,"Hazy golden coloured body with a nice rich, thick seven centimetre tall pure white head. Aroma of grass, hay, mellow english and/or german hops, some nuttiness, a lot of floral elements and a plain honey sweetness noticeable close to the end. Light-Bodied; Strong grassy and very herbal flavours at first with a dose of citrus and coriander seed freshness, but a pale hop flavour follows and finishes with a dash of light spices/herbs. Aftertaste is mellow and floral, but a lot of grassy flavours and sweetness show through towards the end, as well. Overall, a nice and refreshing beer that shows well when its hot outside! This is my first Zwickel since being in Wien last year, and it was well worth the wait - a nice option to have if you like the style and cant get to Austria. I sampled this sixteen ounce can purchased from New Beer Distributors in New York, New York on 21-January-2017 for US$3,00 sampled at home in Washington on a hot 21-April-2017.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
3331,"2017-04-12",4.2,"Pours a cloudy gold with decent eggshell head that leaves a foamy collar of lace. Nose involves sweet pale malt, musty cellar, light dash of sulphur, clean floral and spicy hops. Lightly sweet, decently bitter. Medium bodied, decently active yet soft toward creamy in mouthfeel, with a clean and dry floral hop finish. I cannot get enough of this style and while Im absolutely certain from all Ive read and heard on this site and elsewhere that the Zwickels and Kellers of Franconia are the quintessential examples, I find this to be outstanding of its own right due to its subtle complexity and all around enjoyable drinking experience.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"

The taste is dry with hints that are both sweet and tart. Similar to the nose, grass and lemon factor heavily in here, along with bread, a bit of a cereal flavor, and hints of spices. The aftertaste is a short lemon. This one is light to medium in body, smooth in texture, and average in carbonation. This was very easy to drink and went down very well. It wont be the most complex beer youll find, but its solid. As a minor note, this came in a pretty cool pull top can.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"

But 5 days after also watching your hometown losing Game 7 to the fucking 108 year old goat-curse believing North Siders (after being up 3-1 no less) and on the eve of a possible apocalyptic election scenario, the after work beer choice was all the more difficult. Picked this because I still have to walk my kid to school in the morning before I vote. So yeah... pale straw yellow pour, generous white head with excellent retention. Nose is grassy, Meyer lemons, grainy malt. Mouth is medium bodied, mild malt sweetness, toasty grains and some grass. Goes down super easy. So far I like here this Urban Chestnut brewery. Proves not every brewer in St. Louis is a profit driven, horse shit shoveling mega-corporate malt-based Nazi regime ;-)

Has a lively carbonation among a body so light, that, just as on the nose, almost no flavors become recognizable. 

Does not provide any taste evolution at all, while the beers straw flavor turns thin and thinner, creating a watery taste. 

This reminds me of why I turned away from industrial made Lagers, as this taste nothing but boring and dull. The annoying thing about it to me is, that this got brewed by a small operation I had put high hops in.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3331,"2016-07-14",3.0,"500 ml bottle (and more American brewers should do these 500 ml bottles dammit, theyre cool) from Woodmans in Janesville, WI, sampled in a Zywiec lager glass. Why do I point that out? Because everything contributes to the experience. Like, Im not listening to music now, its quiet with just a bit of traffic from the highway .5 km away and yes Im one of those pretentious Americans who insist on the Metric system even though family members threaten to punch me - anyway, and soon Ill be drinking this as I clean up from dinner of hasenpfeffer, spaetzle and beets. Zwickels a good cleaning beer, not too demanding but enough body and heft that I dont want to pound it, and then not get through the dishes until morning. Speaking of which I just happened on a review from a guy I used to know, I closed my eyes and she slipped away....sorry, Proustian moment, within a Proustian moment, and anyway, this was a review of a beer Ive had, and it was dead wrong, and Im convinced it was because the reviewer was dead drunk at the time. Shame on you C______! Getting back to the beer here, and my glassware fetish: a Zywiec glass holds just enough so that Ill have to do two pours, also slowing me down. Anyway this is a lightly hazy/oily golden/amber with a smallish head that does not last; the aroma is grassy, a bit weedy, faintly sour but also with a modicum of honey. On the palate its bready, sweeter than the New Glarus I had a couple of days ago, with a very short, slightly metallic, dry finish. Really only the faintest hint of those Hallertau hops - this is all about the malts which alas dominate a bit much in this grassy-biscuit flavor profile, which gives a rather cloying profile when it warms up even to cellar temperature. Its overall certainly drinkable but to my taste far from a great example of the style. I have a feeling this would come off significantly better on draught.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

3331,"2012-12-27",2.0,"Draught at Urban Chesunut: Foggy lemon. Scattered foam with a jagged collar. Strong sulfur odors accompany a yeasty nose of dough and paint, with off notes of husky malt (burnt wood) and apple. Hint of DMS and metal shavings, and only a trace of hoppy nectar. Loose, prickly carbonation. Lemony hop twinge gives way to husky malt which discharges a burnt wood astringency, immediately displacing the crackery aspects. Hops are very oily with a spicy tickle. Abundance of doughy, vitamin-B-laden yeast deadens the brighter  shades of lemon. Unremitting huskiness ensures no brightness is to return. Floral softness shyly exudes, though the malt is continually lifeless with a papery, stale wafer-cookie dullness. Severely fuzzy and muddled throughout, with an uncanny void of malt, mineral, and hop vividness. Finishes wafery and dull with stewed apple and tacky paintlike yeast compounding the muddled nature, though a late but crisp mineral and hop nectar flourish somewhat salvages drinkability. Well, as a huge fan of Franconian lager, I couldnt have been more excited about this brewery. But I must say is this is a rather depressing example of zwickelbier!  Yeasty and unclean to the point of inducing nausea.  Sadly, considering  the other six or seven offerings being poured at the time of my visit all share the same general character to this one (unfinished, very muddled, unclean), its safe to say this is a brewery with its heart in the right place but perhaps lacking the brewing skills. And if it helps to add objectivity to my review, I drove a little over 2 1/2 hours each way to sample just this beer fresh from the source, as zwickelbier generally fares poorly in the bottle, which means I *really* wanted to like it.
