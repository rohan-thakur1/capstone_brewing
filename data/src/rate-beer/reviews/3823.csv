3823,"2017-06-01",3.9,"2015 bottle (a couple of months past its best by date, but who cares with this style?). This tastes like drinking a bit of history. Brett saisons are delicious, and this is definitely one of the milestones of the style. It keeps a lot of the hallmarks of a saison (more than most chart-topping mixed fermentation saisons) -- its peppery, and very effervescent, and its got a clear yeast profile that reminded me a lot of Dupont. The Brett is present, but its integrated and not overpowering. This would be a great gateway beer for people that are just getting into Brett beers.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
3823,"2017-05-29",4.2,"25.4floz (750ml) 2016 vintage bottle (BOD: 01.22.2016, BBD: 01.2018) - $13, stored in my basement (not-cellared) for about a year, poured into a tulip glass. A very voluminous head develops on the pour that settles down to a rocky formation. I recall there to b quite a bit of foam from prior experiences, but this was a lot atop a golden body. The nose consists of lively sour funk, straddling the line between wildflower and band-aid aromas. This comes on mildly palate that feels lighter than the ABV (although it is apparent) suggests. Finishes dry and see this as pairing well with Mediterranean fare especially well. As far as seasonality, spring seems like the best time to drink this wonderful saison.","","balloonbuffoon"

3823,"2017-04-23",4.4,"2015 edition, consumed 23 April 2017. Slightly cloudy, dark yellow pour with thick, fine foam that fades into a rocky cap. Lots of brett mustiness in the nose with some spice, cracker malt and fruity hop notes. Medium  light body with some fizz, slightly slick. Initial sharp barnyard musty taste that quickly gives way to a smooth malt middle and a mildly fruity hop finish. The mineral phenols are muted at first, but as the beer warms they appear and mingle well with the malt. (Is it pilsner malt?) There is a sharpness that is not quite tart or acidic. I think the age of the beer has diminished the hops somewhat, which is fine with me. The 8.5% ABV contributes to the sharpness and leaves a mild burn at the end. A robust, rich saison, certainly in the super category. Much more complex and rewarding than Tank 7. This bottle was a couple months past its best by date. I would be willing to try an even older one.","Pennsylvania, USA","PanMarek"

Boulevard has a knack for making Saisons with big malt backbones and large doses of hops. It works brilliantly in this case.

3823,"2014-10-12",4.0,"Hazed brought gold after a bit of yeast disturbance; abundant, cascading foam, even with great care. Fresh meadow and cutting herbal nose, with softening stone fruit moments and a persistent lacquer of alcohol. White peppercorns, lavender, green banana also present. Minor phenols to round out a prototypical high booze brett aroma.

Blanched almonds provide a creamy, sweet flavor that balances the generally angular, funky disposition here. Bretty dry cherry and pineapple acid and gruyere like funk are always lingering. Alcohol character is slightly obese. Finishing flavors are soap-like, floral and medicinal driven.  A fiery, acidic, wooden JP like impression is foundational here.

The careful pour initially yielded a mountainous rocky foam, and throughout, the palate seems to shift course several times perhaps owing to that issue. It is initially tense and thin, but with a bit of time and yeast pour livens with carbonation, zest, and depth; the final impression is somewhat washy and stretched out. The life drained more quickly from this than from the many stellar tap versions Ive had.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

3823,"2014-08-02",5.0,"The golden colored body that was poured out of the 750 ml bomber, was cloudy. The bomber was capped with a cork, and wire cage, and the long pop, and the ample gun smoke were evidence of a good seal, and generous carbonation. The head that formed atop the pour was four fingers thick, and very stubborn. The smell was very rustic, ad the beer was clearly blessed with smells of wheat crackers, horse blanket, hay, orange peel, and white pepper. This is just exactly what I want a Saison to smell like.

The taste was dry, biscuit like, with an unmistakable presence of Brett. There was some bready sweetness, and a hint of pepper and lime juice in the finish. The combination of sweet, tart, spicy, and funky was very well done. The body was fluffy, light, and quenching, and the 8.5% ABV was very well hidden.

It tastes nice, but not at all what I was hoping or expecting. Sad to say. That lovely brett touch is absolutely present here and its almost a little cellarish as well. Almost like the cork has infused a little bit with the content and made it a bit to wood and cork oriented. Its almost a bit dusty and earthy in the mouth actually. Some green apples, fruity canned pineapple juices, sharp brett citrus fruits and a little bit of yeast is also found. By all means its a nice one and it actually just gets better and better the further down the bottle you get, but I guess my expectations were just a little bit to high on this. 16.01.2014","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

3823,"2014-03-02",4.2,"750ml bottle into a tulip. From notes.

A: Pours a hazy yellow color with tons of carbonation and even some yeast floaties. The eggshell-colored head is tall (three fingers high) and quite foamy in texture. While its texture is inconsistent, the lacing left behind is...well, its inconsistent. Looks nice, though.

S: The funk here is subtle, and its backed by some citrusy notes. As it sits in the glass, it develops a nice earthen tone, with some lesser qualities of black pepper and phenols. Some very timid sourness can also be caught. This aroma has some nice complexity, I must say.

T: Bready, spicy yeast hits the palate first. Its funkiness gradually builds on the palate, but never to the point of excess. The finish is nice and citrusy, with some underlying lemon notes. Complex, but in a soft, suggestive way: it never bludgeons the palate in any manner

M: Indeed, this is a soft yet full brew - a bit too astringent though. Not like it matters, because this is dry, fizzy, and immensely drinkable. I really dont want this to end.

O: I love Tank 7 and I love this. If I have to nitpick (and I always have to, every single time) its that the complexity is a bit concealed. Luckily, discovering all of its nuances is such an enjoyable experience. Ill definitely have to get more next year!","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

3823,"2013-12-20",3.9,"I held onto a bottle from 09 to compare with a freshy 11. Thanks John for making this happen.

Grades are based on the newer/fresher bottle

So, the beer is a straw yellow ale which appears to develop some haziness over time (possibly pour technique yielded the cloudiness). There are at least three fingers per pour, and at times overflowing for both years. Evidently carbonated, the 09 turned completely to foam on my first sip; subsequent sips were not as explosive. The nose on the elder was earthy, subtly sour and grainy: meh. The youth lacked the brett action provided its lack of maturity, and was sweet, earthy, grassy and pleasant. Flavor wise, the elder of the two had picked up sooo much brett character, I couldnt get past it (dry, baking soda, bitter, hollow); this is a similar experience to my aged Orval experiences: just not for me. The 11 was really pleasant and highlighted the yeast and hops in the beer. Really noble and rustic. Finish on the old one was like a slime in my mouth, took several minutes of constant tongue action to get it off. The 11 had a semi dry finish. 

Overall this is a decent saison fresh, but I fear I might have an aversion to such application of Brett. Not something I would seek, but can see why others dig it.

I actually called the wife into the kitchen so she could witness the absolute swirlingness. Three stage pour over ten minutes for a full goblet. Thick foaming lacing sticks to sides of goblet in an unnervingly large fashion. I mean it looks like spray foam insulation....wow. Nose of brett and dry yeast. Basement and soil tone abound. Yay.

S - Funky. Yeast. Sweetness. Florals. Fruity. Ridiculously complex. I cannot wait to taste this brew.

T - The complexity of the nose carries through to the taste. Its nice to not have the nose fail the taste for a change. The hops bring forth the earthy and herbal flavors. Citrus (lemon first and then grapefruit) is present.The herbal flavors are a bit spicy and peppery. Not as funky as the smell would let on. Very balanced between all the complex flavors. All in all, very crisp and refreshing. Finishes with some hop dryness. The aftertaste dissipates quickly.

M - Really creamy and smooth. Tingly too.

O - Definitely builds on Boulevards Tank 7 saison. The great saison is there, but a rich complexity and a funkiness from the Brett adds so much. No booziness whatsoever for being 8.5. For me, this is amazingly drinkable. This is the perfect summer beer. As I drink it, I can hear the first cicadas of the year singing their insect song outside my window.

3823,"2013-09-17",3.7,"2011 vintage, bottle #10000.
Aroma is fairly fruity with quite a bit of pear and some lighter red apple esters. Faint yeast character and light citrus. Brett character has slight cherry pie note and faint barnyard character but it is definitely a more earthy strain. 
Pours a dull, cloudy orange with a big pillowy white wad that has fairly good retention. Head slowly recedes leaving behind moderate lacing and faint legs. 
Flavor has a moderate fruitiness to it with some pear and citrus along with hints of cherry pie. A light stale malt character with some honey notes. Low herbal hop character with medium bitterness. Low barnyard funk with a similar earthy Brett character. Medium light phenolic character with a nice pepper note. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth.
Overall an alright beer, but the age may have hurt this one. I remember this beer being brighter when fresh and was dismayed to see that the malt character had turned a bit stale. I also wish that the Brett was fruitier as the hops provide a dank character already.

3823,"2013-03-21",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 22, 2013 22 ounce bottle. Brettanomyces, Greek for ""British yeast"" is typically shunned due to the off-flavor it imparts when contaminating traditional, sacchromyces yeasted beers. Here, they key in on the brett flavors, which is especially fitting for a saison. Saisons are already a very loose style of beer, largely known for their historic context as a Wallonia (French-Belgian) farm laborers post-work summer beverage. They were allotted 5 liters per day of the stuff.  Its fruity, light, heavily carbonated and spicy...good for hot weather. The farmhouse flavors highlighted here are appropriate for a farmworkers style of beer. Its a dusty yellow color, bubbles all over the place, thick foam on top, heavy lacing. Aroma is lemon, sweet, dank, and musty. Somehow it pulls off a sort of good b.o. smell. Palate is medium bodied, fizzy, very drinkable. Taste is more of that musty farmhouse deal, citrus, pepper. Overall its a really delicious example of a brett beer and definitely worth a try if youre looking for an approachable spin of that distinctive component.","Illinois, USA","brian60625"

Brilliant pour - glorious golden pour with a massive bright white pillowy head with a thick glass coating. Not sure if this De Koninck glass is equipped with an etching or not but either way it looks amazing in this glass. Lemon, orange and mild funky nose comes first, quite savory actually, belgian yeast base, wonderful citrus. After a longer sit there are candy-like cherry notes. I do dig that side of the complexity but this is not overly deep. Every refill gives a massive cap that settles slowly and perfectly. Gotta say the Pennywise tonight is fucking perfect. Bleg yeast, hints at US hops for sure. Orange, bite, alcohol early on and later when nearing room temp, light spice, like a coriander I think, slightly creamy on the edges, weak heat here and there. yea, i dig it. where does this sit? I dont know. the review took teh entire 750. now all i can think of is popcorn and butter. Poured in the sludge. I enjoyed this but I will admit as a non-saison fan this beer did nothign to sell me on the style. I really yhink that I have a hard time appreciating the style and I need a sit down wtih someone who loves it to usher me in better. good stuff 100% I dont agree at all. Then again I dont realy knwo how to nail the greatness of the style down. i do dig the citrussyy and light peppery lingers.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Lots of brett in this one--pretty dry. Its good, but its not quenching--dries out the mouth and is pretty intense. Tons of carbonation, biting and fluffs the body up. Interesting beer--would like to see this with 2-3 years on it.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
3823,"2012-07-15",4.3,"2012 bottle. Slightly hazy, burnt yellow with a small white head. The aroma is mostly Belgian saison yeast, with esters and spice. The brett character is pretty mellow, with a light funkiness. The flavor starts out sweet, but dries out with spice and yeast. Slightly tart on the finish, with Syrian Goldings maybe?, and a light brett character. Very soft carbonation as they probably account for aging. Wonderful blend of flavors and interesting on the palate as the dry / tart finish starts while its still sweet. Great beer, best saison Ive ever had.","Joliet, Illinois, USA","monkeychugg55"

Thanks for sharing, Chris.
A: Gusher! After the cloudy, white, bubbly head finally settled, the beer appeared hazy with a straw yellow hue.
S: Lots of brettanomyces in the aroma. Behind the brett there are notes of hay, flowers, and earth
T: Brett is the dominant taste here. Wild yeast with a spicy kick. Lots of carbonation, perhaps too much. I wish there was more balance. The brett seems to overpower some of the other aspects of this beer, and while the brett flavor is pleasant, I believe this beer would be exceptional if other flavors were brought to light.
M: A decent feel, maybe over carbonated, a spicy bite in the finish
D: One glass was plenty for me. A nice beer that has potential to be awesome. Im anxious to sample a more recent batch to compare and contrast against this one.""","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

Very good retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that coats the glass with chunks of soapy lacing. Funky, earthy aroma with a prominent brett character that compliments the earthy saison yeast very nicely. Hints of grass, straw and hay along with some zesty, peppery spice and crisp, light fruit, especially apple and pear. Medium bodied and heavily carbonated at first with a funky, earthy brett flavor that adds dryness, complimenting the saison yeast characteristics. Nice bready yeast presence with hints of coriander and pepper along with some apple and pear. A nice amount of sweetness to counter the dry brett and grassy notes. Crisp, refreshing and very easy to drink. Very good.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","gramity"

Pours to a large head with great lacing; bright yellow in appearance.  Taste is tangy lemon with alcohol with neither dominating too much over the other.  Little bit of banana as well.  Just a tad too much sour, neck-choking pungency in the finish for my total preferences, but still an interesting beer.  This isnt something Id get regularly, but its a nice change of pace from my pale ales and other non-Brett Belgian styles.  If you love Brett, its a must-get.","Missouri, USA","kdm1984"

Beautiful hazy medium orange with a floculent clingy undying head. Aroma is sweet and funky, over-ripe nectarine, honey. Rounded, soft fruity palate, strongly reminiscent of an ice wine we recently had, loads of sticky stonefruit (apricot maybe?), honey, white grapes, with beautifully integrated yeast character and an assertive funkiness.

Also some orange peel zest by mid-palate; sour cheese, pancake cough, resinated funk, and hay. Pretty tasty all and all.

Saison Brett pours a golden yellow, mostly clean with a bit of haze in the middle. Lots of carbonation evident from the ever-present champagne carbonation rising up to support a generous fizzy head. 

A lot of barnyard funk and light grain in the nose, then some tart green apples, white grapes, and lemon zest. Lightly spicy and a burst of grassy aromas toward the end. 

Pale malt helps the flavor start sweet, then turn sour with some green apple and white grape notes. It turns funky with a good dose of barnyard and wet dog. Finally the grassy flavors come out to smooth out the finish. 

This has a medium body with tons of crisp carbonation. Fairly dry, but not over the top.

A tiny of bit of funk.  Not overwhelming like some other beers dosed with Brett.  Actually everything in the smell was light.  Small amount of lemon peel and spice.  Nice background of yeast and an slight earthy aroma.  Really nice.

Now what I didnt pick up with the smell was a nice fruity presense.  Its here in the taste though.  Lemon, citrus, and mango.  The tartness and funk are there but like in the smell its very smell.  It just adds to the taste and doesnt try to take over.  I actually wish it was would of had a little bit more of a role in the taste.  Yeasty with a pale malt background.  The taste is nice but its also very light.

This one had about two years on it and was still going strong. The brettanomyces is still doing its work and has at least another six months before it peters out. Depending on your preferences drink it fresh or sit on it. Either way it will be excellent.

Aroma / Appearance - Surging layers of delicate head bubble up above a cloudy translucent base. Bright and radiant it glows coppery. Stark bone dry textures seep up with such intensity they also dry out the air above. Like brittle leaves it feels as if the whole thing could fall apart at any time. Backing it is a can of oranges spiked with yeast.

Flavor / Palate - Dry and tart the brett eats at the back of the throat. It almost feels a little salty. White bread, orange creme, and earthiness mix into a fluid experience. It doesnt have much more mellowing to do but it feels like it has some legs still. Overall this is one to check out either fresh or with some months on it.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3823,"2011-09-19",3.7,"Bottle, from trade. Pours a light honey orange body with a huge, cloudy head. Aroma is citrus, orange peel, hay, bretty sour tones. Hints of Belgian ale yeast and molasses. Taste is complex and nuanced: dry, yeasty peppery tones, hints of alcohol, floral notes and citrus. Smooth and very drinkable despite the high ABV. The brett comes through very subtly throughout the aftertaste, but only after a while. Very dry and still mellow mouthfeel. A pleasant saison indeed, but hardly the worlds finest IMO.

3823,"2011-09-09",4.1,"From Tennesseejed420, with many, many thanks: Pours a blonde colour with a nice saisonish type head. However, before I noticed how this beer looked, I also noticed how the cork smelled: earthy, funky, almost dirty, tasty, tangy, and a few other adjectives if you care to listen. The aroma of this beer is truly unique. It has a weird earthiness that is hard to describe. The saison funk is all about this jawn, but there is a weird layer on top of that that gives it a strange new character. Weird what bacteria can do to a beer (btw since I was a kid my father always told me that bacteria is not bad because you need it for beer... he didnt know about the brett). Anyway, the taste has a modicum of sweetness. A nice dryish mouthfeel and more earth and dirt and all that fancy stuff than you can imagine. When I opened this I thought I would get a funky saison, instead I got a weirdly unique monster of a beer. This be dank. Better than the already awesome Tank 7.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

In the past, prior to having this account, I dranl a great deal of this. it was much more available Prior to this batch, lingering for months after release. This beer helped Kansas City learn that you could expect and want so much more from a beer. At least for me. Beautiful dry hopped aroma that mingles with some brett funk. Taste is a sharp combination of the scents woven tight. citrus, lemon grass, earth, and subtle funk. Beautiful light copper hay color with rocky head that leaves decent lacing. Some chunks of yeast hang among fast pacing rising bubbles. Complex earthy taste that has elements that blend so well and become one combined taste. Elegant hop, lemongrass, citrus bite, that meets distinct brett flavor. AMAZING.

Aroma: The nose yeast, bread, grass, citrus, orange, spice, malts, and a little bit of funk

Appearance: The pour is a mostly clear golden color with a foamy white head and good lacing

Flavor: Tastes of bread, citrus, and bitter orange flavors, but the brett/funk is much stronger in the taste

Palate: Medium bodied with a somewhat creamy mouthfeel, and a long dry, bitter and funky finish to it

Overall Impression: 
Overall, this is a pretty interesting beer.  The nose doesnt do justice to reveal the bitter and funkiness that comes out in the flavor of this one.  Anyway, this is a very solid saison with an interesting yeasty-bitter-citrus-funk character that I didnt describe that weel, but that is kind of hard to describe any better than that.  Trust me though, it is worth trying.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Medium bodied and heavily carbonated at first with a funky, earthy brett flavor that adds dryness, complimenting the saison yeast characteristics.

3823,"2011-01-17",4.1,"Poured into a tulip. Batch 2009-2, bottle #11281 of 13400.

4.5 A: First pour yields a clear golden straw color. Three fingers of frothy, yet creamy cream colored head. Pretty good retention and tons of lacing.

5.0 S: Quite fruity, even for a saison. Lots of yellow apples and wild red apples. Peaches too. Then comes the yeasty aspects with pepper, clove, and general yeastiness. Funk is the third aspect in the nose with mustiness, a touch of horseblanket, a touch of brett, and a small touch of acid. Really impressive. Complex as hell with everything blending together well.

4.0 T: Again, very complex but it doesnt mesh as well as in the nose. Straw and musky funk up front. Brett comes through much better though. Fruitiness again with emphasis on wild red apple and peach. Theres a touch of booziness in here as well. Peppery yeastiness. Sweet grainy malts. Hardly any bitterness.

4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Spritzy carbonation. Not as smooth as Id like because of the booziness. Still, no major flaws.

4.0 D: Good beer, very complex, just not my cup of tea (beer). I did enjoy it very much, and I have another bottle to age. Maybe itll become better for me.

Faint lemon and sweetness with some baking spices and a bitterness that comes out of nowhere.  Fairly substantial body that foams as it moves and some sharpness from the carbonation and ends in a subtle lingering bitterness.

3823,"2010-11-27",4.0,"A: Straw yellow with a very large amount of white head.

S: Lots of earthiness coming from the brett here, as well as some citrus and a few earthy hops.

T: Not much of the typical saison spice, the main focus here is definitely the earthiness of the brett. Perhaps the brett was let shine a little too much, as I didnt detect many of the other saison signatures.

M: Medium bodied with a good dose of carbonation.

D: Quite drinkable and very refreshing on a hot summer evening.

Flavor is brett funk, sweet hay, wildflower floral notes, wet rocks, old birch wood, spice, pepper and basement. Palate is medium bodied, with a slick entry immediately turning dry, lighter feeling on the palate and has an odd, but awesome carbonation, light, sharp, yet somehow velvety at the same time.

WAY too carbonated.  with an attempt to stifle the head production, it is still 4 times the amount of liquid that enters my glass.

nice floral aroma of some roses lemon, and a mix of sweet feet.  Yes I said feet.  not too bad for a saison.
 taste is very smooth, as expected from this style,with some lemon and rose flavors coming out.  very nice, I could drink tis a while.  Dont let it get too warm though as it tends to head south.  bottle mentions earthiness, but I honestly dont taste it at all.  overall a damn good beer.

3823,"2010-05-16",4.0,"Thanks stowehop for knocking off one of my wants! It pours golden yellow/orange with a towering, frothy head. Beautiful aroma of oranges, spices, heavy brett influence with leather and horseblanket. This smells really dry, yeasty and funky. The flavor is very funky and spicy. Lots of horseblanket and leather, some orange rind and spices lead to a very dry, hoppy finish. Im not sure how old this bottle is, but the Brett has really taken over. To be honest, there is something slightly off. Mild hints of bandaid and burnt plastic, but I only noticed it toward the end of the bottle. It could have been the funk destroying my palate for all I know. This was just short of excellence IMO.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

Fruity aroma of pears, apple, citrus, flowers, fresh cut grass, yeast and a light spice note.  The same flavors for the most part.  Refreshing.  The alcohol doesnt show.  I had the Tank 7 not too long ago and this really does taste like that with an added funky element.  More drinkable and refined too.  The hops are still here but not quite as assertive as Tank 7.  I get a nice citrusy melon flavor that comes out more as it warms and it mixes nicely with the brett character and hops.  In many ways this beer is the best of both worlds.  Enough alcohol and big flavors to satisfy the Imperial lovers while still being elegant, clean and refreshing.  Probably needless to say but I enjoyed this one.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

Initial sharp clove nose clears with a little swirling, and the happy aromas begin: the smell of fresh rain on parched red earth, flowery lemon notes, menthol, black pepper, ripe pears. Bright and peppery on the palate, but a certain viney silkiness persists. Minty lemon flavor, briskly hoppy, dry with just a hint of melon sweetness in the finish. Beautiful, sophisticated beer.

3823,"2010-03-07",4.2,"750mL bottle, 2008 batch 1, courtesy of maximum12 poured into a tulip.

Massive pop when the cork opens up and no surprise when the pour generates a gigantic fluffy white head that goes absolutely nowhere.  The body is a slightly hazy golden yellow and as bubbly as champagne.

The aroma is extremely refreshing and bright with lemon zest, Belgian yeast and some spices as well.  The brett adds some complexity but doesnt dominate and its still more citrusy than earthy.

The taste is even more refreshing but with a more prevalent brett presence.  The initial taste is off lemon zest and hops with the Belgian yeast forming a solid barckbone before the finish brings the earthy funk to the forefront.

To say the mouthfeel is lively would be a massive understatement.  Crazy amoiunt of carbonation, maybe too much though it doesnt take away from things.

Brett yeast, sweet citrus, mint, lemongrass, chamomille, and light woodsy note.  When cold, things were not very good-astringent and harsh, but really opens up as it warms with notes of lemongrass, brett, sweet citrus, and pale malts.  my only gripe is the malt profile here gets a little mushy flavored on the finish.  Palate was much harsher cold-big carbonation tingle on the tongue but as it warmed, things got better-carbonation was not so harsh and the flavors opened up a bit more.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"

3823,"2010-03-01",4.2,"A: A great looking pour on this beer! The color is golden and pretty hazy with a huge, fluffy white head.

S: An incredible amount of fruitiness to this beer (which I was not really expecting). A lot of pineapple, apples, and citrus which seems like an odd combination but works quite well together. Theres a mild spice and yeast component which at least lets you know the beer is a Saison. The brett seems to provide a touch of farmhouse character, but nothing overwhelming.

T: Again, the sweet fruits really come through. The pineapple and citrus flavors are quite intense and work well with the yeasty, slighty spicy flavors and the dry, lightly bitter finish. Again, the Brett does not provide a lot in the way of ""funk,"" but it does give a touch of wild character and it does help to dry out the beer.

M: The beer is quite light and soft on the palate, like a Saison should be. The high carbonation help makes this a very refreshing beer.

D: Easily the best Saison Ive come across. I enjoyed that it was a bit more reserved on the pepper notes and had an increased level of fruit and dryness. A very solid beer and Im glad Ive got one of my own at home.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

Much livelier nose than the regular saison. A bit farm yard-ish. Medium bodied and sweeter than the regular saison with a touch of brett funk. Smoother mouth feel with a hint of warming alcohol and moderate carbonation. The sugars created a somewhat sticky mouth feel.

3823,"2010-01-11",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2011 Batch 2008-1 bottle thanks to soonah!Crazy foamy white head atop hazy gold-straw colored body that is heavily carbonated. Almost no saison left in the nose, just full on yet balanced brett in strong citrus, light hay, and a creamy note. The flavor is similar but dryer, hints of pepper and yeast in the finish to smooth the brett out. Lightly biting body, hints of soap and the brett goes into overdrive as it warms. Should have drank this sooner for more balance and nuance.

Multiple samples later and I like this way more.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

Its mostly sweet and faintly tart with a light grassy hop background.  Despite the bubbles on the pour, the carbonation isnt overwhelming at all.

3823,"2010-01-07",4.8,"Bottle(s) from Gomers Lees Summit.  Read otakudens review, mine cant do this justice.  Shines like yellow straw in the sun.  Head is soft and creamy and lingers perfectly, finally fading into lacing as you drink it away.  The small bubbles of carbonation constantly rising seem like evidence of the lively brett.  From the second it hits your tongue it dances through to the finish.  So much going on i cant describe it well- yeast and light spices, brett earthiness, classic saison flavors, tart (and yet soft!) fruits... its just too complex for my vocabulary.  Hops are not overdone at all, i almost forget about them with so much else im trying to pinpoint but then they provide a wonderful, slightly dry finish.  With some age the fruity characters fade into barnyard funk.  I love it fresh, as opposed to over 6 months old, but think it is going to be killer with a couple years of age.  So buy as much as you can, drink half now, cellar half for a few years.","Missouri, USA","mbsmith"

3823,"2010-01-03",4.4,"Up to bat today is one of my favorite Belgian styles: the saison, aka the farmhouse ale. Even better, this one has the blessed kiss of the Brettanomyces family of yeast. Oh yeah, come to Kristyn! You think Im joking? The bottle of Boulevard Saison with Brett that I supped lovingly on was #10503 of #11950 bottles produced. Thats it. No more. A limited release of a rare beer brewed for taste and the discerning palate, a state of mind everyone is capable of with just a wee bit of an open mind and a sprinkling of curiosity marked by a fun sense of adventure. Now that is the spice of life.


She pours resembling the whitish pith of oranges with a very generous head of soft foam which clings in scattered clumps to the sides of my glass. As the center of her brew clears, a wonderful nose of crisp sliced lemons, zesty, pithy, and rindy at the same time tickles my nose. Toasted meringue swings in for second place, followed by a parade of sourdough, white pepper, granny smith apples, buttered toast, sawdust, fresh leather, and a touch of saddlebag. A dab or two on my neck and I am ready for a night out on the town, yes maam. Wiping the drool from my chin, I lovingly take the first of many spine-tingling sips. Are those harps I hear? Once more, fresh lemon takes center stage, proudly sporting all her individual charms of zest, pith, and zing while white pepper adds a dash of spice to the background. Pervading her whole palate with many thanks given to that dashing princess-charming, Brettanomyces, is sawdust, fresh leather, and a touch of dry baled hay. Complimenting her lemon presence is an emerging addition of white grapefruit while each quaff dries my palate which I lovingly quench with each tender sip. White pepper gentle tinges my breath, while a faint tartness hints of the granny smith apples that were in her nose. Choosing to offer its silent support, toasted bread is only there if you look for it, and I really had to look for it. Thats okay though; malt is not the star of this show, and rightfully so.


Even though I knew our love affair would eventually have to come to an end, I sure as heck didnt want it too. Just little longer under the sheets, if you please. But my wishes were not answered, and as I cradle my empty glass, I thank the beer goddesses and gods for this moment of beervana.

This is a phenomenal beer, well worthy of the milestone rating.  Bottle #7153 via trade on BA thanks to Ineedabeerhere.  The bottle was a gusher as my it was uncorked.  Brought my Bruery tulip over to save as much of the foam as I could.  It was hard to pour this stuff without getting a crazy amount of foam and very little beer.  Once you succeed in pouring it though, it pours a hazy golden color with a massive foamy white head that takes awhile to fade.  Aroma is bretty and yeasty, along with honey, pale malt, citrus, spice, and earthy notes.  Flavor is awesome and complex.  Lots of brett in there, but its not ridiculous.  Bready pale malt, honey, spice and pepper, lemon, and floral hops.  Medium-light and prickly on the palate, extremely crisp and refreshing.  Drinkability is very high.  Overall this is a beer that just doesnt have many flaws to it.  This is about as good as the saison style gets.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

The bite is a little too much, which is really my only problem. The bite seems like a combination of alcohol, tartness, and maybe minerallyness. The tart could be fine, but with the other too mixed in, it is a little much. Maybe it just needs a year or so.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","ketchepillar"
3823,"2009-12-24",3.7,"Picked up at Pike Street Beer and Wine. A little pricey, but I have been waiting to try this thing for quite some time. Nice haze orange with a rather fluffy head that fades away SLOWLY. Nice looking saison. Lovely lemon sour funk with some brett aroma. Some nice light fruit aromas, maybe even a little acidic/citrus fruits are noticed. Lovely aroma that is decently pungent. Wow, a fairly carbonated beer. I wish it were a bit smoother. I do like carbonation in some beers, but I am deciding whether or not this is pissing me off. Funky fruit aroma with the brett hitting your taste buds throughout the experience. Lemon/citrus sour arent really coming through, but this is not a sour. Some grass flavors going on here as well (going towards the lemon grass).

The aroma is just straightforward citrus and brett with lots of lemon peel, grass, and hay.   Not really intense though, and seemed to dissipate after awhile, needing a top-up to kick back into action.   The flavor is relatively clean for a saison, but gets all the nuances in there, with dry malt flavors, soft yet spicy bitterness and hop flavors, and a nice light bretty funk.   Medium-light body with higher carbonation and smooth bubbles.   Nothing really amazing about it, but it is no doubt a quality and well constructed saison.   Im not sure how old this bottle was, but it did have a relatively bright, fresh quality to the flavor and aroma, so maybe more time in the cellar would add some interesting stuff to it with the yeast developing a little more.

The taste is more towards a base Saison with wheat husks, spent pale malts, old Saaz hops, and earthy yeast.

Musty and completely old skool, as I taste this, I think Dupont more and more every other sip. Again there is a lovely subdued mint note that I really dig.

This Wild Ales expansive effervescence propels the coniferous brettanomyces through the straw-like cereals, floral hops and pineapple subtleties for a world-class brew.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam garnishes the misty bright golden.
-The brettanomyces and hops team up for a wonderfully spicy, herbal display of harmony.
-There is no sign of the alcohol in this one.
-This is superbly executed and highly pleasurable. 
-Fruitiness is reminiscent of pears and green apples at times.

The flavor is moderately sweet, moderately bitter and lightly acidic. It finishes lightly to moderately sweet, moderately bitter and moderately acidic. Medium body, watery texture that turns velvety in the finish, lively carbonation. The brett and bitter resin are most noticable, but there is sweet citrus in the background.

Smells like honey, spice, apricot or mold, similar to a hefeweizen, a deep cloudy amber.  Nothing jumps out at first, a hint of bitterness from the hops perhaps, but then a profound dryness appears and casts a border around the sweet lemony notes backed up by a good yeast note.  Lively is the right word for how this feels in the mouth, a smooth, uniform carbonation that doesnt change from the moment you first take it in to the swallow.

Smell: Delicate malt base to support notes of honeysuckle blossoms, melon juice, citrus, and spice. The funkiness remains light, with lessers notes of well-maintained horseblankets, fresh leather, and only a teeny tiny drop of butyric acid.

Taste: Pilsner malts, light pale malts, and maybe even some soft white wheat garnished with a dusting of sweet table sugar. Fruity tastes of melon garnished with lemon zest. Light florals throughout. Restrained hop bitterness. The funkiness from the Brettanomyces, though pleasant, present, and appreciated, is fairly understated, providing refined tastes of top-shelf cobwebs and recently-cleaned basements.

3823,"2009-07-14",3.6,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2012 2009 edition  Batch 1: Speckled bronzed-yellow. Clingy, mountainous cap of white foam condenses into a meringue consistency. Divine nose of minerals, cotton, Band-Aid, tangerine, pineapple sherbet, lemon zest, and a refined medley of peppery, floral, herbal hops. Fluffy pillow of froth caresses the palate. Initially brisk with a gritty Brett-induced mineralic clinch swirled with a raspy mouthful of grassy hops and a fervid phenolic snap reminiscent of white and black pepper. Artfully refined notes of Band-Aid and floral hops boast their softness as they temper the spiciness while cushioning the firm body. Splash of ripe citric acid follows to bolster the remarkably full center which remains full and creamy despite the bracing dryness. Vividly defined crackery Pils malt gradually takes foothold as it generates ample sharpness as well as a teasing piecrust toastiness. Though the hop bitterness is chalky and borderline astringent,  it drips with succulent citrus flavors (tangerine, mandarin orange, grapefruit pith) and delicate floral tones. Fusion of peach and dried pineapple contribute more subtle sweetness and juiciness. Yeast displays a puttylike quality as well as a candied pistachio sweetness. Finishes explosively Bretty and phenolic with a tongue-numbing assualt of mineralic phenols and cottony harshness. Belches beautifully as elegant citrus and floral flavors abound with each burp. Springier Band-Aid accompanies background notes of pineapple sherbet, lemon zest, and grass. Pretty magical stuff, though I slightly prefer the keg-conditioned versions sampled over the years. Id like to see them either tone down and/or refine the unruly/chalky/aspirinlike hop bitterness (Amarillo?!), or ditch the Amarillo altogether and replace it with a softer and more delicate varietal (Hallertauer or Stryian Goldings?). This is a beer worthy of hours of attention as you contemplate the awe-inspiring marvels of yeast and masterful brewing.   Well, the initial batches were once great, but the hops have apparently been ramped up to excessive levels, ultimately rendering this chalky and aspirinlike. While the brett character is delightfully pungent and horsey, I now find it somewhat one-dimensional as it no longer possesses that lovely tropical-fruit softness of the initial batches. Where their now-retired flagship Saison was a mastery of finesse and finespun delicacy, this is the antithesis. I just wish both could coexist, for those who want an authentic saison. Still, a pretty good beer.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

A little warmth is needed for the Brett to emerge as a mild yet solid backbone to excellent Saison yeast electricity, subtle spice of ginger and austere lemon citrus. Orange zest is on deep background. This is extremely well-constructed.

The clean yet bright spicy feel is what makes the Saison style so interesting overall. This is a little tightness with mild sweetness and huge yeast electricity. Hops are really quiet - a little pine but very mild considering this one has been dry-hopped. Still, they contribute in body to the clean dryness of the offering. A bit of bone-dry oakiness emerges with warmth. Brett is slow to develop, but its definitely there.

One of the better new-world Saisons Ive encountered. A bit of everything...the floral and piney hops (subtle, but theyre there...especially with warmth) mesh with the dry oak to leave a lasting impression. Savor this one - surprisingly it doesnt drink entirely quickly. Still, its awesome.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

3823,"2009-07-02",4.2,"Typical saison pour with a hazy, golden color and a very full, even with a slow pour, white, creamy, dense, rocky head which settles in a long time to a small dense froth and leaves lots of Belgian lace.  Nose is fragrant with a lot of fresh herbs (chamomile, sage), fresh floral leaves, some light barnyard/hay funk, deceivingly prominent white pepper, dry bready/crackery malts, light tangy/lemony citrus, faint yeast esters (banana); lots of things going into this one.  Flavor is similar to the nose but with a long progression; flavor starts with a sharp lemony tartness (which actually is very nice), light honey, and white pepper begin the progression with similar fresh herbal notes as the nose and crackery malts filtering in next.  Towards the finish the light hay funkiness and a moderate, spicy bitterness.  Palate is lively to fizzy but seemed less due to the creamy mouthfeel, nearly medium body , and the drying finish; the initial prickliness is balanced by the early, quenching tartness and the finishing dryness and mild warmth.  Finish long and continues the herbal notes, the apparent dryness, some lingering bitterness, and just hints at lemons and white pepper.  Not one aspect of the beer was great, but everything was put together so incredibly well and everything made me want another sip.  The warmth was more than I usually like for a saison but with the brett tartness, it actually accentuated the spicy and herbal notes.  Nowhere near what I typically ask for in a saison, but certainly a well crafted beer.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Flavor is packed with candied plums, yeast, sugared pineapple and mandarin orange. Also along for the ride is the Brett, although it was not too funky. Mouthfell is very carbonated and effervescent. Overall, everything was well in balance. The only downside is that when it gets warm, everything is out of balance and the flavor is not really that good, so drink it chilled, and if you are drinking the bottle by yourself, keep it in the fridge.","Norman, Oklahoma, USA","milljam"

The aroma has distinct cheese notes with subtle funk and plenty of yeast. It seems dryish and woodsy. I am prepared for a fairly authentic take on the style and am not disappointed. This does not  have a strong Belgian ester quality nor is it malt heavy. Rather, this is subtle with hints at cheese, straw, and the woods. . .maybe a field. I liked this one. It further garnishes my respect for Boulevard.

Bottle of the 2015 from an online retailer in Chicago. Saison Brett came and went around here and I got a huge craving for it after the fact, of course. So here it is from mail order and boy am I glad I got a bottle this year. This is perfect use of Brettanomyces. The aroma is funky, cheesy, wild and tart with hints at peppers, light citrus, straw and earth. The body is very effervescent and bone dry. The complex flavor is so impressive and keeps the glass going to my lips often. Really great funky, balanced, wild beer.

Bottle from Mile High. Holy crap, this beer never ceases to amaze me. The initial pour is very much like a real, classic Belgian ale. The white head is just explosive with a barely hazy gold body underneath. The carbonation is very lively. The aroma is rich, pungent, peppery, cheesy, bready. The palate is bone dry with a funky flavor which suggests pineapples and straw. Crazy good. It could pass for any of the finest Brett beers straight from Belgium.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
3823,"2008-12-20",4.1,"Bottle 4022, purchased about 10 minutes north of the brewery.  Pours a glowing gold with a bit of cloudiness.  Champagne-like bubbles and a lot of carbonation cause wild amounts of head on the first pour that cling in a lacy pattern.

Notes of musky apple, candied orange peel, black pepper, and perfumy, floral hops all show well, while a strong, dry, bretty presence permeates all.  Flavors follow suit, initially sweet from the caramel apple, quickly turning dry, bready, and yeasty from all that brett.  Hints of lemonpepper linger on the tongue long after the finish.

The flavor is dryed out by a funky brett element.  Very interesting.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

3823,"2008-11-30",4.0,"A slightly cloudy golden pour with a nice, fluffy white head that produced sticky lace.  The aroma was light citrus, sweet sugar cookie, peppery spice and of course yeasty brett.  Not hit you over the head with a snow shovel brett, just enough to make it interesting.  Flavor was quite nice too.  Good balance between citrus, sugar cookie, spice, earth and yeast.  Dry, easy drinking mouthfeel.  Very nice.  Highly recommended.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","Soonah"
3823,"2008-11-30",4.0,"Thanks to Tim for sending this brew. I really enjoyed the regular saison, so this was bound to be good. The bretts give a tart funkiness that amplifies the dryness of the beer. Lemon citrus notes to the finish along with a soft pepper dry spice character. The high carbonation really accentuated the esters and the bretts, keeping it all very crisp.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
3823,"2008-11-29",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 14, 2009 Re-rate, bottle 8846 from theisti. Wow, about another year on this thing and it was much more amazing. Lots lots of the original saison character for a bone-dry Belgian-Ale type Bret character that was excellent. Poured with a huge rocky and pillowy head, just like Orval. Yum! Thanks, Tim, this was much better that much later! Original rating: Bottle courtesy of theisti, shared by me among the best at SL. Pour was pretty standard for a saison, off-white head was large and featured lively carbonation. The aroma was sweet fruity, caramel, slightly bready malts. The flavor followed, strong sweet malt base, light spicing and peppers in the finish, only faint dry-bretty type notes under an overwhelmingly sweet and malty base. I had to yield to slobs unhappiness w.r.t. the level of Bret (its near absence), but I got more in there than he did, even if it was underwhelming. Either way, many thanks, Tim, for this fun brew and great opportunity.","","User37895"

3823,"2008-11-19",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 4, 2012 Bottle No. 01148 of 11960, batch number 2008-1; Sampled November 2008
This is very well carbonated, as an exceedingly careful pour has me staring at four-fingers of foam that slowly grows to six fingers of foam and starts to pour over the sides of my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip glass.  I only lose a touch of beer to the billowing, off-white / cream colored head.  The beer is a clear, orange gold color that shows an almost brilliantly clear, bright, yellow-gold color when held up to the light.  The aroma has an awesome grassy hop / malt note to it, ample touches of lemon zest, some tropical fruit and lychee notes, lots of cracker like grain notes and an underlying, musky Brettanomyces signature that cant quite hide despite the expressive malt and hop character.  After 5 minutes or so I still have five-fingers of head on top of my beer, so I guess Ill continue to enjoy the aroma.  Other noticeable notes of tangerine, a phenolic, almost plastic like, musty, butyric acid funkiness, phenolic soaked cotton-balls as well as a wild, weed-like / grassy note that is quite nice.

Lightly sweet tasting and this has a certain fullness to the body that lets me know that the Brettanomyces has a lot of residual sugars to work with (this thing will likely go bottle bomb at some point).  This is not sweet though, just not dry.  What sweetness is here accentuates hop flavors of tangerine, lychee, bergamot as well as some light herbal notes and a definite floral influence.  Interestingly the foam tastes heavily of a phenolic Brettanomyces character, but the Brett does not play nearly as significant a role in the flavor of the beer.  The Brett does play a role here in the flavor though as it contributes a spicy, phenolic character that provides some balancing sharpness to the finish.  This last, mixes with a bitterness from the hops that also sharpens the finish which provides a balance to the sweet malt and fruity hop notes found up front.

This is pretty tasty, I do wish that it finished a bit drier (especially since as this ages it will get more and more carbonated, it is already over carbonated, and could become a bottle bomb, though with a champagne bottle this is not too likely).  Visually perfect for a Saison, the ample carbonation projects a magnificent head, with lots of lacing and lots of staying power.  Despite being a bit thicker and a bit sweeter than I generally prefer in a Saison, both these components work quite well in this beer; the extra touch of hop character (especially the American bent) certainly helps with this.  It will certainly be interesting to see how this develops as the hops fade and the Brett becomes more prominent, especially if it can keep from becoming explosive.  Taken as a sum of its components (at least as far as aroma and flavor go), this beer is not nearly as good as it is in the complete whole; e.g. it is lacking in funky aromatic notes, isnt nearly dry enough, nor is the texture perfect.  On the whole though this beer just works quite well and is very enjoyable.  I am glad I have a couple bottles of this to age.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Strong lemon zest aroma, as Ethan noted, slightly sweet but soon mellowed out by the yeasts. It’s fairly mild at the outset, and not really too bretty at this stage, but it’s certainly pleasantly yeasty and dry as it gets to room temp.

Upfront and loaded with a zesty lemon mixed with a wheat maltiness. Flowery and hay, spicy, alfafa sprout taste. Crisp, earthy, bubbly, strawlike, and sticky palate with a mild lingering spice/bitterness. Slightly tart, but very clean and dry. Overall, a zesty, hoppy, bubbly, and clean beer that makes me feel like jumping into a big pile of barnyard hay.

The overcarbonated keg poured this beer nearly all head, and a resilient head at that, which impeded the aroma a bit without vigorous swirling. However, the revealed aroma was rewarding, with big florals and nice, horsy brett undertones. The brett is apparent though at no point makes this sour, instead just adding a very barnyard kind of flavor to this. The flavor itself is super dry, with cracker, hay, and some salt. Almost reminds me of a gose. Very light drinking but still rich in flavor, also with notes of caraway and rye. Complexity is awesome and this doesn’t feel even close to a 6.5% beer.

Finish is very chewy in its dryness with dark grains in the middle and black pepper at the very back of the tongue, salty counterpoints on the sides.

3823,"2007-10-19",3.5,"Sampled at GABF Pre-Party.  2006 version from a keg.  Big frothy long lasting head (likely due to being agitated).  Hazy onion skin color.  Lightly funky aroma with hints of citrus and sour.  Flavor is very enjoyable with light brett hints, lemon and other citrus.  Creamy mouth feel, well carbonated and medium body.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"
3823,"2007-10-14",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 16, 2012 Re-rate: Fragrant, fresh hops dominate this one.  Awesome beer when fresh.

GABF 07.  Pours hazy yellow with a small, frothy, off-white head, lasting with fair lacing.  Aroma is average malt (bread, straw, cereal), average hops (citrus), average yeast (horse blanket, earth) with notes of apple and banana.  Light bodied, thin texture, soft carbonation, and a bitter finish.  Average duration, light sweetness, moderate acidity and bitterness.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"

Delicate flavor, wheat, touch of bananna, a light white pepper, not much bret character but a very dry finish, mellow and nice.  Good stuff.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
3823,"2007-10-13",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 2, 2012 GABF 2007.  Pours to a lightly hazy pale yellow body with a creamy white head.  The aroma is funktified pineapple and saison yeasts with a crisp grain.  Very nice aroma.  The flavors meld together nicely.  Sweet pineapples, brett is mild, malt is crisp and light.  Yeasts are strongly saison.  Lightly tart refreshing palate. 8, 3, 8, 4, 15 = 3.8

Bottle 313/11925 for 2009 batch 1 sampled 1/2/2012.  Pours to an awesome hazy glowing golden body with a tall starch white head and sexy lacing.  A nice effervescence is visible in the body.  The aroma is pineapple with a huge delicate floral note.  The flavor is delicate with floral notes and subtle pineapple and crisp saison yeasts and coriander.  Some nice bretty things going on, but no leathers or acid.  The palate is light bodied and crisp.  8.5% is nowhere to be seen.  This held up really well and I cant say its going down hill anytime soon.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
3823,"2007-10-12",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2009 Fantastic white, rocky head.  Taste is funky sour with a slight spice and fizzy goodness.  Wow, this is an outstanding beer.  Subtle, crisp, refreshingly good.","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"
3823,"2007-10-08",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2009 Old rating Boulevard Saison with George Brett. Served at the Power Plant Festival in Dec. 06. On tap. I had several glasses, it was my favorite beer of the day. Hazy golden color. Aroma is bretty, wool horseblanket, citrus. Great aroma. Taste is wheaty and citrusy with a very nice brett finish. This is a wonderful beer and I would love to drink it all summer.  
10/13/08-750ml bottle, No. 08555 Served in a chalice only slightly chilled. This beer is different than the Boulevard Saison Brett I I have enjoyed many, many times since that first taste at the Power Plant Strong Ale fest. The original batch and all the subsequent test batches are based on the smokestack saison, whereas this one is based on a stronger saison recipe resulting in an 8.5% beer. Aroma is candi sugar, light fruits, black pepper, faint higher alcohols, and some funky brett brux. The brett is pretty muted at this time, of course it was just released so Ill revisit it 6 months down the road. The taste is sweet, biscuty pils malt, black pepper, leathery brett funk, light fruit, and a bit of a harsh taste, possibly spicy phenolics or some brett byproduct with some pretty floral notes at the back end. Im going to revisit this beer in a few months, it is good now, but I suspect it needs a little more time in the bottle to become the beer Blvd wants. No score given on this bottle.  
12/21/08-750ml bottle, No. 08554. The brett has finally taken a foothold in this beer and gives it a wonderful earthy, barnyardy aroma that compliments the existing fruitiness. The flavor is similar with a very nice balance of the brett character and the base beer. The beer should continue to age gracefully and Ill try not to revisit it for a few months.  
03/06/09-I was lucky enough to find a couple more bottles a week ago. Im already breaking into them. I fear that I have underrated this beer. So drinkable, but yet so tasty. My rerate was longer, but I got cut off.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"
3823,"2007-09-06",4.3,"Both the 2006 and 2007 vintages sampled on tap at BCTC. Scores are combined for the 2 beers. Hazy yellow color with a medium sized white head that wouldnt go away. Funky, herbal aroma of wet straw, citrus, Brett and some black pepper. The 06 was much more ""Bretty"", while the 07 was more floral and citrusy. The flavor of the 06 had quite a bit of Brett funkiness, along with citrus, wet hay, mild cheese. The 07 had a ""brighter"" flavor, with less Brett and more herbal notes and grassiness. Both were quite good but the aged 06 was a stand out.","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","jimmack"
3823,"2007-09-06",4.4,"Draft @ Boulevard, along with theisti (thanks to both Tim and John!).  Color is a hazy yellow with a slight orange tint, ample white head, and good lacing.  Aroma was captivating albiet slightly subdued, providing a good dose of spicy earthiness, some mild citrus hops, and just the right amount of funkiness.  Flavor was very well balanced and enhanced the aroma nicely.  This is one fine creation Boulevard has here, and look forward to the release of all their Smokestack Series later in the fall!","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"
3823,"2007-09-01",4.8,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2015 ++++ RE-RATE 21 January 2015 ++++
2013 Batch.  Bottle purchased in May of 2013 and stored in my wine fridge.  The pour is clear golden with a billowing four inch white head.  The foams falls slowly with pretty lacing. The aroma is leather, very much fully developed Brett.  There is some soft lime citrus present as well.  Engaging nose.  The taste is dry leather Brett, some farmyard funk and the lime citrus from the nose.  Very much the fully developed Brett as the nose suggested, though the flavor is not quite as pleasant as the aroma.  Still solid, just perhaps too much of the Brett to take the beer out of balance.  The palate is medium bodied with active carbonation and the residual dry leather funk in the finish.  Bit past the prime, though still a delicious beer.  (9,4,7,4,16 - 4.0)
++++ RE-RATE 22 August 2012 ++++
Three bottle blind tasting of 2012 Batch 1, 2011 Batch 1 (stored in a ~72 degree closet) and 2011 Batch 1 (stored in a ~55 wine fridge).  The goal was to determine which version we preferred, as well as attempt to identify which bottle was which.

Bottle 1.  Bottle opens with a loud pop.  First pour from the bottle.  The pour is mostly clear golden, with a one inch white head, that falls pretty quick.  The aroma is soft floral hops, soft ahy, fruit sweet, and the light Brett notes.  Fresh, alive nose.  The taste is hay, floral, clove and the leathery Brett.  Aftertaste shows herbal.  The palate is soft, active fine carbonation, turns sweet, then finishes dry.  (8,4,8,4,17  4.1)  I predicted this was the 2012, it was in fact the 2011 which had been stored in the wine fridge.

Bottle 2.  This bottle also opened with a loud pop.  Third pour from the bottle.  The pour is soft haze golden, with a foamy three inch white head, falls with nice lace.  The aroma is soft Brett, spice yeast, hay, and apricot fruit.  The taste is herbal, hay, grass, dry leather of the Brett.  The palate is soft, active fine carbonation, light sweetness and then a bone dry finish.  This one showed more of the Brett character.  (9,4,8,4,17  4.2)  I predicted this was the 2011 wine fridge, it was in fact the 2011 closet version.

Bottle 3.  This bottle opened quietly.  Third pour from the bottle.  The pour is golden, mostly clear, with some visible chunks floating around.  Not too much of a white head.  The aroma is leather, soft earthy Brett.  The taste is floral honey, hay, lemon citrus and some (almost off tasting) dirty leather Brett yeast.  The palate was soft, active carbonation, the sweetness and a dry finish (though probably the least dry of the three samples).  (8,4,7,4,15  3.8)  I predicted this was the 2011 closet, it was in fact the 2012.

This was a really interesting blind tasting.  I was surprised I did not properly identify any of the beers, yet my order of preference ended up being what I would have guessed going into the exercise. 


++++ RE-RATE  22 January 2009 ++++ 2008 Batch.   Bottle #08629 of 11950.  Lets check in and see how this one is doing.  Bottle purchased in October 2008 and stored in my cellar.  Opens with a loud pop. Poured into my Smokestack chalice. Pour is hazed yellow golden with active carbonation and billowy 3 inch white head. Head falls slowly with spidery lacing.  Aroma of gentle Brett goodness, earth, horse blanket, flowery - so expressive, so amazing. Wow this is as close to perfect a nose as I can imagine for this beer. Taste is the peppery, earthy, bretty, horse blanket of the nose. Absolutely bone dry. Again, this is tasting really great. Palate is mouth coating yet dry at the same time. Texture is so interesting, really exposes all the amazing flavors. My word has this beer come together. Wonderful, just wonderful. I never thought I would raise my score, but here we go. (10,5,9,4,20 - 4.8)

++++ Original Rating - Sept 1, 2007 ++++ Advanced preview of this beer at the invitation of the Brewery.  Draft, on tap at the Brewery.  They mentioned this had 6 months or a bit more age on it.  Pour is a slightly hazy yellow with a nice white head.  Aroma is just stunningly good, citrus (grapefruit) hops, some earthiness, and just the perfect amount of Tart grassy musty Brett.  Taste is extremely smooth, with a nice hop brightness at the beginning, moving into the complexity of the Brett and finishing with a really nice dryness.  This is just a great Saison enhanced  (but not overpowered) by the Brett.  I really enjoyed the regular Boulevard Saison and thought it lacked just a bit of character and complexity.  The regular Saison would be perfect for everyday, this is perfect for that special treat with a great meal.  Phenomenal job Boulevard, and thank you.  Cant wait until this is more regularly available.  Thank you John Bryan for allowing me to taste this one! (10,5,9,4,19 - 4.7)","Kansas, USA","theisti"
3823,"2007-07-26",4.0,"Draft, 2006 vintage, BCTC 2007.  Pours a hazy, bright-yellow color; textured, light yellow head with perfect retention and lacing that coats the glass.

3823,"2007-07-25",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 5, 2007 BCTC 2007. Drank alot of this with the Boulevard crew & Tomme Arthur after things were shut down. One of the best I had there. Had both the 06 & 07. Both were phenominal. Cloudy, hazy, citrusy, some of the ""horse blanket""  aspect that I dont seem to grasp. Absolutely loved this stuff","Buffalo, New York, USA","swoopjones"
3823,"2007-07-23",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 18, 2012 2006 vintage poured at the BCTC festival.  I probably drank about three pints of this by the end of the session, as they were being pretty generous with the pours and were basically filling up my tulip (smelled way better than in the festival tasting glass).  Perfect appearance, with cascading ripples of white lace slowly crawling down the sides of the glass, and a 60-70% opaque yellow glowing body.  The nose of this saison is just incredible, in fact its likely one of the most pure funky and bretty aromas Ive experienced, even more so than 100% brettanomyces beer.  The funk is intense and sharp, like stinky, old feta cheese and fluffy hay and barnyard scents... then an amazing grassiness and floral hop quality.  Texture is very smooth and mellow, and the flavors are heavily perfumy, with brett potpourri and lavendar flowers mixed in as well.    The best beer at the festival by far, and one of the few beers I look back on and easily say it was one of my favorites of all time.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3823,"2007-07-23",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2011 I cant believe I have never updated my rating of this - have had in the bottle many times and have always been impressed - I recently had the opportunity to try a three year old bottle (thanks, Eugene!) and was completely floored - soooo dry and delicious - funky, but not in a way that interferes with the refreshing nature of the beer - superbly balanced - I must buy a bunch and age them for a few years - a beautiful beer - [BCTC 07] 2006 vintage, 3.9- had this last year and failed to rate it - I must say that one year later this beer has gotten much more complex than I remember - huge brett aroma, with a nice floral character and dried herbs - very grassy and earthy, complimented by the barnyardy brett funkiness - herbal and lemony, with a background cheesy flavor that I usually only taste in really complex lambics (ie. Cantillon) - really nice stuff.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
3823,"2007-07-22",4.9,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2013 BCTC - 2007 version on tap.  Probably the highlight of the fest for me, I am not saying top rated but the highlight for sure.  Yellow murky with a small head.  Aroma is all damn brett and fresh as hell (what I like to refer as cherry juice with sourness) it completely dominates.  Taste is herbal and grassy outside of the sourness, a nice dichotomy. Very light and quaffable though. I had the 06 version as well (no notes) and I remember it less grassy.8/4/7/3/16. Re-rate: JB shared an 2006 version, 3 years old  (consumed 01/2009) at Indras Strong Ale tasting.  This was a bottled, in-house and it was so damn bretty at this point.  Lots of general funk with thick musky floral aspects.  Aged very nicely so far and give me much hope for my bottles.9/4/8/3/17.My first rating from a bottle but I have had this a lot.  2008 bottle number 12000 out of 11950  (hilarious, I know).  This was a 3-year old bottle  that was split three ways including notalush.  Popped the cork and the head rushed up the neck, just enough to turtle but did not gush out.  Perfectly done Blvd.  The beer is a beautiful orange-ish glow to the beer, too thick to see through, and has a large, foamy head.  Otherwise, its all amazing tropical and wild brett.  Absolutely no sign of age.  Love this damn beer. 9/5/9/4/18. 
Final Update (6/2013):  Last year I did a blind tasting of different vintages of this beer aged in different conditions (fresh, cellar, wine fridge, closet).  This year we made the tasting even bigger (2011 @ 63; 2011 @ 70; 2012 @ 70; 2013; 2011 @ 55; 2012 - store; 2012 @ 55; 2008 - closet).  That is a range of first batch to most recent and a mix of different cellar temps for the past 2 years.
Bottom Line: fresh bottles are slightly above average for this beer with a strong hop presence and not much brett.  The best bottles are those that mesh the dry hop with the brett.  So, delicately aged for 2 years or the year old bottle that sat on the store shelf.  Worst was the first batch, age very present.This is definitely the beer I have the most experience with and its as close as to the best beer as far as I am concerned.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

3823,"2007-04-07",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2009 sampled on tap at the 5th Boulder Strong Ale Fest.

10/2009, thanks to holdenn for sharing a bottle with about 11months age on it, gushed bretty goodness in my glass, lots of brett but not super dried out yet. i think these brett golden beers should be available and acceptable to drink any where in life.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
3823,"2006-12-10",3.8,"Sampled on draught at the Power Plant Strong Ale Fest.  Massively fruity aroma, mostly citric with hints of apricot and pineapple, some lightly farmy and funky notes here courtesy of the Brett, along with hints of straw and some pale, sweet maltiness and herbal tones in the background.  Hazy light-medium golden color with an uneven head.  Flavor practically explodes on the palate with Brett character, lightly tart and spicy with a good bit of farminess here as well, some freshly-cut wood, herbal, leafy, moderately bitter hops and light pepper on the finish.

3823,"2006-10-08",4.2,"Draft, pre-GABF party: First, thanks to the guys at Boulevard for bringing this (and the tripel). Hazy orange hue with a fluffy head. Very inviting nose, clean and fresh. Smooth, soft and subtly rich texture. Tasty malts with a balanced bitterness. Wonderful aromas throughout. Lemongrass, flowers and hay. Brett influence was surely noticeable but not overdone. Great amount of horse blanket, earth and fresh phenols. Nice amount of spice (mainly clove) and a pinch of fruit (lemon spritz) in the background, too. The more I drank the more I wanted to drink. Had at least four or five small glasses of this stuff over the course of the evening, and it just kept getting better. Very smooth and pleasant stuff, with just enough funk and kick to keep things interesting.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

3823,"2006-09-28",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 9, 2009 Bottle.

Head is initially huge, frothy, white, mostly lasting.
Body is hazy medium yellow, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately hoppy (resin), lightly to moderately yeasty (horseblanket, barnyard), with notes of lemon zest, band-aid.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

All draught samples Ive had have been great, near 4.0 level, but both fresh and months-old bottles are overly hoppy in a resinous way.  Still pretty good, but the regular 6.5% saison is much superior.  Sad about the rumor that the latter is supposedly going to be discontinued...isnt that always the way of things?  The best stuff is not the most popular and thus ends up getting the axe.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3823,"2006-09-12",4.2,"Since the base beer was pretty good, this version with brett is phenomenal.  One of my first samples from BCTC 06.  Pours a turbid hazy yellow with a massive long lasting head.  Aroma is full with brett character- farmhouse, horseblanket, clovey spices, light sea-salt, citrusy/lemon, earth, dirt, and herbal hops.  Full flavor- more brett, yeasty, lemony and a bit tart in the end- more spice, clove, pepper, coriander, lemon zest.  Nice full body and smooth complex finish.  Dry body in the end.

3823,"2006-07-18",4.9,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2007 BCTC 2006 and BCTC 2007.  At BCTC 2006 I had the Boulevard Saison and Saison With George Bret side-by-side.  At BCTC 2007 I had the Saison With George Bret 2006 and 2007 side-by-side.  Very cloudy blonde-yellow body with a small white head.  Brett explosion on the nose.  Mouthfeel is full yet very silky.  Taste is very very funky.  Rather grassy with a lemony twist.  Light fruity note.  Minimal hops presence.  But overall this is all about the bretty yeast and amazing mouthfeel.  The aged 2006 had a fuller body and a little sourness that made it even more drinkable.  Im not sure if there is a beer I could drink more often without getting tired of.  Even my beloved Orval could become tiresome if I was to drink 6/day for two years.  But not this one.  Nothing aggressive, just perfect refreshing wild funky beer that doesnt overdo anything.  In terms of brett-oriented beer it gives a run for its money to the Luciernaga.  The staff and the stand told me they will soon start bottling it.  If they can make it almost as good as the draft versions then Ill be as happy as four fags sitting on an upside-down bar stool.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
