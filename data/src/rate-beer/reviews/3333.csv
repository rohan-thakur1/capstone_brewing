3333,"2015-11-12",2.4,"From tap at Eckerts. Mostly clean amber-orange body with a rigid and fine-bubbled white head. Aroma is lightly malty with notes of toffee, malt husks, dish soap, flint, pipe tobacco, cauliflower. Medium-light bodied, sweet and sour and twangy with low bitterness. The silky fine carbonation and supple and soft mouthfeel are enjoyable, but the malt is basic caramel-toffee and toasted grain, the finish is quick and short and paper-y, and the aroma is very off. Ive learned in the last two years that Eckerts has cleanliness problems, its the only place Ive had bad Gänstaller beer (and more than once), so this one being off may be their fault, but Drei Kronen Memmelsdorf is a notoriously dirty brewery, so who am I to say its not their fault? Pretty bad either way, starts out when served cold at around a 2.8 but room temperature really exposes its flaws.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

3333,"2014-06-22",4.2,"A head of mixed bubbles sits on this slightly cloudy amber colored brew. Its got a touch of malt in the nose. It is light bodied but still a bit sweet and highly carbonated without being harsh. It is malt forward which makes it come off as a bit creamy too. It is slightly fruity with cherry and raisin up front with a touch of lemon. It ifnishes with a lingering bit of sweetness. This is a wonderful beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

3333,"2012-06-12",3.7,"Draught in Eckerts - Im told this is brewed for the restaurant by Drei Kronen in Memmelsdorf.  Lightly hazy copper with slow carbonation and a frothy, rocky eggshell head.  Sweet and fruity nose.  Taste is lightly sweet, no hops here, only light bitterness, caramel malt absolutely the focus, but the fruity-yeasty addition is superb (maybe a hair too much apple).  Medium body with a light crispness.  Dont know what it was about this morning, but I was on a string of good luck with monster beers.  Well, such is the allure of Bamberg.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
