1960,"2012-03-01",4.2,"Appearance: oil and pitch under an espresso crema head, tight and creamy, which eventually fades into a thin layer with a slightly thicker border. Swirls thick along the edges.

Nose: chocolate covered dark fruits. Melted European chocolates. Black root followed by char, tar and smoke mingling together effortlessly. Chocolate covered dried cherries. Chocolate covered almonds. Dark fruit tartness along the edges. Dense delicious fudge.

Palate: smooth and silky mouthfeel, gliding across my tongue with a slow persistent building bitter burnt nutty finish. Dark fruits dominate the middle. Hints of red wine and leathery tannins skirt the edges. Chocolate truffle powder in the back followed by a brief hit of peat and smoke. Burnt caramel and espresso crema. Fresh coffee notes fade as the beer warms up, slipping into the background. Grows ever smoother and silkier with each quaff until there is no more. Chocolate is the glue which holds everything together in sublime seduction.

Final Thoughts: yum! Liquid dessert or breakfast. Chocolate and coffee are good anytime of the day as is beer such as the Chocolate Stout from Flying Fish.

Lingering bitterness resembles coffee bitterness, along with a good amount of dark chocolate and cocoa job character. Hearty character, nice stout, well done follow through with the chocolate notes.

1960,"2011-11-05",4.3,"Bottle. It poured a very deep dark black with a large (2-3 finger) dense creamy medium brown head that lasted throughout and had exquisite lacing that stuck very well to the glass.

The aroma right off gets you with a nice whiff of chocolate then a moderate roasted dark bread malt and a sweet leathery yeast with hints of dark roasted coffee, caramel, a touch of dark fruit and a tinge of citrus.

The taste well lets just say ""WOW"" begins with a mild bitterness that has a nice note of coffee, then it progresses into a much sweeter flavor with a large dose of chocolate and a mild fruitiness at the end. The flavor only lasted an average amount of time after the swallow which was rather disappointing since it tasted so good.

Mouthfeel was extremely full and chewy in body with the texture being super creamy and having a nice soft carbonation.

1960,"2011-06-11",4.7,"THOUGHTS: Oh dear God, it was wonderful. It was like drinking chocolate syrup. I almost wished I had saved it for Easter. The only problem was that it was a little one sided. Thats not to say it wasnt complex, but it was all very desert like. One of the most intense beers Ive tried this year.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured opaque black (I think thats the first time I actually thought a beer was black and not just really dark brown) with an average to large, light brown head mostly diminished and left good to fair lacing. The aroma was heavy, chocolate milk, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, chocolate cake and chocolate syrup; light to moderate yeast; vanilla; slight alcohol; dark fruit; and slight tobacco when warmer. It somehow was both one-sided and complex. The initial flavor was light to moderately sweet, moderately bitter and lightly acidic; while the finish was moderately sweet, moderate to rather bitter and slightly acidic with an average to long duration. There was chocolate syrup, dark chocolate, yeast, chocolate cake, some dark fruits, slight blueberry, raisin, prune, vanilla, chocolate ice cream, a hint of mint as in mint chocolate chip ice cream or was it chocolate, chocolate chip ice cream. The medium to full body was oily and then a little dry with soft, but tingly carbonation and a slightly chalky finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

1960,"2011-05-25",4.3,"750ml bottle - $9.99 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours out an inky black body with a medium-large, dark tan head.

Smell: Exit Thirteen smells like chocolate, and, with a bit of roastiness, takes on a slight mocha scent, at least until minute notes of citrus, raisin, and maybe even chocolate-covered cherry join the mix.

Taste: Indeed, its chocolate, semi-sweet in taste, alongside more chocolate-minded malts, a packet of cocoa mix, and some roasted barley. Amply sweet throughout. Slight flourish of coffee-toned roasty malts. Half a drop of Nocello. Light fruity esters and a hint of citrus, but it dutifully, even wisely stays out of the way of the main theme: chocolate. Subtle underlying earthiness. Semi-dry, semi-smooth finish with the booze lending a sip of chocolate liqueur.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium carbonation. Tongue-coating mouthfeel like munching on some chocolate squares.

Overall: A tasty chocolate stout! Not as potent or in-your-face as Southern Tiers Choklat or the Rogue Double Chocolate, true, but its still pretty robust, chocolate-wise and has a nice drinkability by being lighter in alcohol.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

1960,"2011-05-08",3.7,"750 ml bottle from TheEpeeist. Thanks, Chris. Pours a pitchblack opaque hue, dark and ominous, rich roasty with a pretty dark brown head, moderate sized dies to a solid film, laces pretty well. Aromas are fluffy cocoa, dark and dry with sweet intermittent punches. Cacao nibs, cookies, fairly dark overall with roasty malts, some smoke and earth, touches of coffee, sweet caramel, biscuits, and toast. Rich chocolate, darker and bitter slanted, seems to dominate. Initial is fuller bodied, actually a bit fluffy and creamy up front, a huge blast of cocoa, dry and bitter, roasty and earthy with dark chocolate taking the leading role. Middle throws some sweeter malts, caramel and toffee, roast, toast, with biscuits, moving back into a dry and bitter finish. This doesnt really get sweet at all, the gentle roast and huge dark chocolate, earthy coffee presence keep sweetness at bay, keeping it dry and bitter. More earthy roast, touch of smoke and ash. But big and smooth, really silky on the palate with good roasty and bitter cocoa lingering on. I like this, finish is roasty and lingering cocoa, bakers chocolate, bitter coffee, dry and bitter and dark dark chocolate lingering on. A bit one dimensional in complexity, but silky and smooth, highly drinkable and great for cocoa lovers, staying darker and away from cloyingly sweet sugar.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

The mouthfeel is creamy yet the beer doesnt come across as too heavy (its almost like drinking chocolate milk).  Real damn good.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","zizzybalubba"

S: Plenty of roasted malt and lots of dark chocolate.  Theres plenty of a dark fruit aroma to the beer as well.  Maybe a touch of vanilla.  Not really a super complex nose as thats really all there is to it.

T: Plenty of bitter dark chocolate flavors to be found here.  A nice solid roast with a hint of espresso.  The dark fruits are there, but a bit more subtle than on the nose.  Somewhat bitter overall.

M: Medium in body with a fairly high level of carbonation.

Aroma: The nose is roasted and chocolaty, heavy malty, with just a hint of citrus hops

Appearance: Pours an opaque brown-black color with a small fluffy tan head and spotty lace

Flavor: The taste is roasted/burnt malts and dark chocolate with light sweetness and bitterness

Palate: This one has a fairly creamy mouthfeel, a medium body, and fairly soft carbonation

Overall Impression: 
I like the description of this one as an import/export stout because the area has a lot of ports.  Cleaver guys...  Anyway, on to the beer, I thought this was a pretty solid beer.  Lots of roasted/burnt malt flavor and semi-sweet chocolate dominate this one with some other components as well.  Good stuff.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

The aroma does have a pleasing level of chocolate that mixes with black strap molasses, earthy chili pepper meat like notes, a thin layer of burnt toast and faint milk chocolate. The taste begins smooth with a nice level of dark chocolate and quickly picking up near burnt malts and earthiness. Toward about midway a sliver of spicy black licorice comes to the surface for a moment before this slides down a chocolate slide into the finish. Very nice chocolate stout.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Flavor gives the impression of a fine mocha - semi-sweet chocolate and high-quality roast coffee, with a hint of caramel and whispers of wood and apple brandy. Smooth texture leaves a subtle but persistent tingle and a surprisingly hoppy finish, as well as tones of chocolate and coffee. A must for stout nuts!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"

Mouthfeel is damn fine.  Not light, not heavy, no syrup, just the perfect combination of light heft and smoooooooth carbonation.  Taste is lightly chocolatey.  Not like chocolate syrup, but more like cocoa and bittersweet chocolate.  Slightly chalky and slightly tangy.  Overall a solid, but not spectacular beer.

1960,"2011-02-03",3.7,"750ml, fairly fresh.  Pours extremely dark, almost black in fact, with just a hint of mahogany translucency showing at the edge.  A moderately tall, spongy head of light brown foam slowly recedes, leaving a thin film in its place.  Skinny, jagged cobweb lacing spreads out across the glass.  The nose is quite nicely balanced, based in burnt wheat steeped with loads of rich, bittersweet dark cocoa.  Blackened caramel comes to mind, along with hints of spicy, raw vanilla bean.  Malts are fairly dry overall, working nicely with some lurking earthen hops.  Flavors follow suit, bittersweet from start to finish, never leaning too far towards one side or the other.  Cocoa nibs come forth in numbers, layering the brew with rich, fairly sharp chocolate notes that work well over top of creamy, darkened wheat and well attenuated, scorched caramel malts.  Earthy hops lend a complimentary edge to the cocoa.  The palate is substantive, but not weighty, peppered with a lively, super-fine carbonation that ushers in an increasingly dry, lengthy finish.  Even at 7.5% ABV, the entire bottle is drinkable thanks to the dryness and even-keeled nature of the brew.  Good stuff.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Obviously chocolate is easily recognizable upfront. Dark roasted malt comes in around the edges, but quickly slips into a sweet finish. I am not too crazy about how this beer ends. There seems to be a metallic/mineral like off flavor in the end, on top of a sweetness that is a notch to high. The bottle says it uses dark wheat which may be the cause of such flavors.

Taste is great toasted wheat up front and dark chocolate give it a bitter start balanced with the sweetnees and not overly smokey roasted malt give it a slight sweetness.  Body is medium to full almost wants to be creamy and finish is a good taste that hangs for a bit.  Not to smokey and chocolate is mixed in perfect","West Deptford, New Jersey, USA","robiannelli"
1960,"2010-12-06",4.0,"Yes indeed, this is a dessert beer. Lots of chocolate. It even looks like a candy bar. Pours an inky black with a velvet tan head that laces nicely. The aroma has some chocolate, vanilla, and nice roast malt. The flavor is similar with a full body and very nice lingering after taste. The flavors intensify as the beer warms.","Sicklerville, New Jersey, USA","keepersj12"
