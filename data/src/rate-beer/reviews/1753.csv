1753,"2015-05-23",3.1,"Pours clear golden with a minimal eggshell head. Aroma is not strong, but has nice fruity and malty notes. Crisp flavor surprises with its strength, and adds a snip or two of hops to e mix. Mouthfeel has good body and a firm, persistent fizz. I love Mozarts music! Maybe I should be listening to one of his symphonies right now.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
1753,"2015-05-08",3.8,"650 ml. filled 02/24/15. Pours clear orange-amber with a lasting island of creamy foam on top. Aroma is dark bread, earthy honeycomb and touches of citrus and spicy dry grass. Tastes of honey, lightly tart apple, toast and a finish of hay, mild lemon and graham cracker. Light-medium body is too fizzy but has a delicate balance.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
1753,"2015-04-24",4.2,"Draft. This is a fantastic lager. Damn, so happy to have this locally. Pours a translucent amber with a light white head that fades fast. Nose is light caramel, biscuit malts, grass, hay, really awesome. Flavor follows suit. Highland is really killing it with the lagers lately. This and the Belmont Pilsner might be my too favorite beers from Highland. Thanks for the recc. De-rock!","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
1753,"2015-04-10",3.3,"Bomber. Beautiful golden color with rising bubbles and a one-finger white head. The aroma is malty and grainy, lots of bread and mild grassy hops. The flavor has a bready malt base with a touch of caramel, but without the sweetness. Some mild hop bitterness on the finish. Medium body with a fairly average mouthfeel, but crisp and dry. Pretty nice little wiener lager, I must say.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
1753,"2015-04-05",3.4,"Pours into the glass a walnut-orange with a wispy head that fully diminishes, leaving trace suds to the fringes. The nose is of malts and light sourdough. Flavors are not too heavy, perfect for a session ale, with caramel, light biscuit and cereal notes, tannins, and finishing with a curt, balancing hop that closes the pull nicely. Medium-bodied, semi-active on the palate with a easy-drinking, light mouthfeel. A perfect accompaniment for Easter dinner!","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"
1753,"2015-03-30",3.6,"Clean tawny amber pour with two fingers of tight off-white head. Nice aroma with a light bready sweetness, grassy hops, toasted grain, and hay. Mellow and easy to drink with a nice and round bready malt profile that shows a light caramel sweetness on the finish. A bright and grassy hop character follows with a medium light body.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
1753,"2015-03-23",3.6,"Clear orange, thin head. Smells like fresh bread and black pepper, Taste is toashty, peppery, and some grassy notes. Nice, clean finish. Simple and tasty.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
