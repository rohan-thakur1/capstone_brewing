2935,"2017-03-28",4.1,"2012 vintage we picked up at the orchards in the fall of 2015. Sampled at at their tasting bar & really wanted a bottle.

Rounded pint glass. Foamy, sturdy plaster white champagne head. Clear, pale gold body.

Smell is sweet, oaky, bitter sharp apples & chardonnay-like tannins. Almost, but not quite fumey. More like aerosol.

Taste is floral & very mildly sweet. Minerally, with a hint of gum flavor. Thin, champagne-y body but with a very slick, almost oily texture.

Really beautiful mouth feel. I need more points to give to palate. Thin at just the right spots, meaty as it swirls around, acidic middle, but dusty & dry on the finish.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"

2935,"2012-03-08",3.9,"Bottle of the 2008, shared with my wife.  Pours a clear straw gold with a vigorous white head that deflates instantly.  Soft lean apples on the nose, warm wood, a touch of straw, and a hint of acid.  Medium bodied, sweet and lively at the start, nicely carbonated.  Nice long tart apple sourness comes through on a long lived lingering finish.  Really good.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
2935,"2010-11-25",3.9,"750 ml bottle (2008) courtesy of a TheEpeeist trade. Thanks, Chris! Youve given me a nice cider rate and youve made the Mrs. Happy. Pours a light golden hue, light maybe a touch of haze. Light carbonated dancing life. Aromas are dry crisp apples, some champagne yeast, light dry with touches of apple juice, sparkling with a touch of tannic and wet oak. Mellow sweet with some light tartness. Initial is lighter bodied, gentle sweet crisp apples, faint honey, dry champagne and a touch of tartness. The dry backend, light prickly carbonation, and touch of tartness on the backend win me over. Lighter sweetness up front, lingers, honeycrisp apples, really nice tartness here, a true cider that feels natural, tart, dry and champagney. Light oak, faint vanilla. Very nice. Quite tart, grows on the palate, dry and honeycrisp. This is quite lovely","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

2935,"2009-03-13",3.4,"750ml bottle from 2006, courtesy TheEpeeist.  Pours absolutely crystal clear, light golden-straw color.  Scattered micro-bubbles build at the bottom of the glass and rocket towards the surface, though the surface is completely void of any sort of foam.  The nose shows sweet red and tart green apples, with a heap of perfumy French oak and vanilla.  Flavors are equally simple, yet well executed.  Theres a light mustiness to the zesty-sweet apples, with a good deal of oaky vanilla. Its relatively full bodied for a carbonated cider, lightly syrupy and sticky on the finish.  Pretty solid.  I prefer a drier carbonated cider, but this one has good flavor.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
2935,"2008-10-02",4.0,"750 ml, 2006.  Clear pale straw with tiny streaming bubbles.  Nose is oak, light chardonnay and mild green apple.  Nicely sharp and crisp with lingering juiciness.  Delicious blend of the different apple sweetnesses but limited tartness.  Notes of pear and champagne vinegar with a dry oaky finish.  Very good.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
2935,"2008-07-27",4.5,"Unlike their other cider, this one comes in 750s.  Pours yellow and fizzy.  Smells of tarte apples, french oak, touches of cinnamon.  Tastes of tarte dry apples with a peppery bite and a nice dry oakiness on the finish.  Both of these ciders really impressed me.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
