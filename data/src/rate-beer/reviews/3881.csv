3881,"2016-02-10",4.5,"BOD 8/24/15. Clear copper pour. Outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention.

Outstanding nose of classic pine and grapefruit rind over biscuit. As it warms subtle orange and dank notes are added.

Almost medium body that is quite smooth in texture and has creamy and oily aspects. World class carbonation with a burst of effervescence in the middle and a finely bubbled rollicking prickly finish.

The flavor profile is world class. Intense hop flavor in the west coast style that is balanced by a bready biscuit with a moderate bitterness sums this one up. It begins with an assault of pine and grapefruit rind hop flavor that slowly transitions to orange and mango as the biscuit sweetness arrives coupled with a touch of caramel. The middle delivers a moderate bitterness that adds a dank quality as it begins to fade. Alcohol is very well covered with just a hint of astringency emerging in the dry finish. A subtle bitterness lingers, but the main component is wonderful rind and dank flavor over a sweet background.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

3881,"2016-01-02",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
This quintessential American IPA develops plenty of flowers, citrus fruit and pine on a honey-laced cereal base balanced out by resinous bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A foam tuft tops the bright pale amber.
-Pineapple fruitiness is also quite engaging.
-Malts share a few biscuity angles as well.
-This one is not reinventing the wheel. But it is a beautifully designed and efficient example.

Dank floral hop aroma with a boat load of citrus and tropical fruit notes followed by pale biscuit malt. Earthy with some grass and pine needle followed by grapefruit, pineapple, mango and blood orange. The nose has a nice balance of resinous oils, earthy grass, citrus fruit and pale malt. 

Fuller bodied than expected with stronger hop bitterness than the aroma suggests. Theres a blast of dank, earthy hop resins up front with sticky grass, pine needle and spruce tip flavors. Nice amount of dry bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes and pale malt into a bone dry finish. Floral and perfume like at first followed by tropical and citrus fruit sweetness. This isnt as strong as in the nose but nicely balances things out with some pineapple, grapefruit and orange zest. Pale malt backbone adds balance without hindering the hop flavor. Some bread and a decent amount of biscuit-like flavor. Clean, crisp and pretty easy to drink but the bitterness could be balanced a little more by the sweeter fruit notes.

3881,"2015-07-31",4.2,"Pours a beautiful, fluffy big head, with a vibrant yellow-amber color.

Smells irresistable lemony, very juicy, coated up by toffeeish, balancing malts. Citrus mingles together with dried orange peel outstandingly well, creating a crisp, lemon defined hoppy nose. 

Has a medium carbonation with an extremely crisp and dry, refreshing mouthfeel. 

Taste mirrors the nose, as it begins with toasty, biscuity malts, as well as bitter, luscious lemons hitting the palate in an uncompromising, fruity fashion. The beers intense lemony hop profile gets enhanced by a mineralic bubbly carbonation, revealing a grassy dryness. This dryness leads to the brews finish, in which the profound lemon character even gets enhanced by a prominent, bitter, lime infused dry note as well as slick sweeter malts, unleashing a very focused lemon fruitiness. 

Easy drinking ipa with a great hoppiness to it, gently balanced by sweeter, flavorwise fitting malts, leaving the beers spotlight on the fruity hops flavors.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Once I did get this into the glass, I saw a light amber, clear, and with a light, white head. The foam did not linger long, and laced lazy and delicately down the sides of the glass.
Im here to tell you that I love Simcoe. I just am a huge fan and theres not much Ill be able to do about it. Okay...moving on.
Im enjoying the tropical fruits involved in the resin right now, the medium body has just enough life to keep my tongue wanting more, the bitter is one of those pleasant things that just reminds you of your last quaff and encourages you to have another.

Also Nilla Wafers, peach, and pineapple. There is an artificial fruit taste. Much drier/pinier than the fruit-dominated aroma would suggest. Very soft in the palate. Light to medium body. Some liveliness. Interesting palate because so soft, but, ultimately, I prefer more body and liveliness.

The appearance was a transparent somewhat golden/orange and slightly yellow colored body with a spectacular looking one finger white foamy head that once it starts dieing. The lacing is just so thick and clingy, nice show.
The smell has bitter hoppiness up front, primarily a nice combination of a citrus/pine-like substance of sorts, slightly spiciness of sorts plays nicely in the background.
The taste has a nice combination of a bittersweetness that plays very nicely with the spicy flavoring coming from the aroma, dry piney aftertaste and finish.
The palate has a nice light to medium body, and is fairly sessionable. Carbonation is great for an AIPA as a more than adequate sharpness invades my tongue and mouth.

3881,"2013-09-16",4.2,"Its golden orange in color, with what looks like a somewhat thin body (thank to the fast-rising carbonation) and an off-white head. For some reason this doesnt look like it should smell as robust with hops as it does. Strong, stiff aromas of pine, fresh, herbal citrus, and a faint whisper of resin rule the roost, with light caramel malts really taking a back seat. Its well-balanced for such a hop-forward beer. Its so delicious in the nose that it almost smells like candy. I dont want to stop smelling it. 

Im not so disappointed that I had to stop smelling it to take a drink, though, because the beer is freaking awesomer in the mouth. Those sticky, fresh, potent, almost candy-like sweet and resinous, piney hops pummel the taste buds as soon as you open your mouth. This is so generously hopped, and the relative thin and non-competing malt body doesnt get in the way. In fact, its very complimentary. The flavor, as is the aroma, is also addictive. If you hadnt already guessed.

Although a good amount of bitterness rears its head in the finish, its extremely tolerable for the amount of hops flavor that it showcases. And man, that bitterness is addictive. Hmm... this seems to be a recurring theme. Its just strong enough to make you respect it, but just tame enough to make you want more right away. What an awesome IPA.

3881,"2013-08-23",3.1,"12oz Bottle. Thanks for sharing, Kevin. Plastic, bubblegum, and cat pee aroma are distinctly Simcoe oriented. Sure, it gets a little tropical and piney, but its too much.

Its clean and smooth with the hoppiness, lacking any of the roughness, but Im just not digging the hop flavor profile. A bit boozy.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Very aromatic nose, perfumey ruby grapefruit, lush tropical fruits, hint of eucalyptus. Gorgeous aroma! The palate is awash in fresh flavourful hop character, with sweet grapefruit standing out among a veritable fruitbowl of tropical fruits. There is a hint of mint in there too. The malts are just a hair sweeter than biscuit/cracker character, so the hops really are the star here. The body and the bitterness are austere enough that drinkability reaches dangerous proportions.

Pours a fairly clear golden orange with a thick slightly off white head with fairly good retention. Low lacing and fairly small legs. 
Flavor starts with a light sweet malt character with some cracker notes. After that it is all hops: lots of grapefruit and pine resin, lesser notes of other citrus and tropical fruit. Moderately high bitterness that is fairly clean. Light alcohol note in the finish along with a lingering bitterness and light malt note. Lingering pine resin and grapefruit. Finish is nice and dry. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a very enjoyable IPA, but I must say I was expecting the hops to be brighter and fruitier. I have had this on tap before and remember it being a much fruitier IPA - this bottle is fairly dank and resiny. Still a very good, West Coast IPA.

A - Pours a hazy amber body with some very small floating particles of what I can only presume is hoppy goodness. Two fingers of dense off white foam forms settling down to a patchy cap. Excellent lacing.

S - Very flowery and grassy with loads of resinous pine and just a dash of citrus. Bit of a caramel malt backbone to bring it all together. Rather sweet.

T - Tons of pine and flowery hops which get cut by a wave of bitterness. A bit of malts are present on the finish. Very little fruit or citrus present, maybe just a bit of grapefruit ""pith"". There it is...I finally used the word pith in a review...but otherwise a pine bomb.

M - Medium bodied and quite creamy. The level of bitterness is damn high on this beer.

Very resinous, dry finish with more pine, grapefruit, some pineapple, papaya, along with some sweetness to cut the hops. Almost like a bubblegum flavor. The hops get more abrasive as it goes down.

Finish: soft but sharp bitterness. Pine flavor left over. Wet feeling in the front of the mouth, dry in the back.

3881,"2012-12-28",4.3,"12oz bottle via trade on BA. pours a gorgeous, clear, copper tinted gold capped by a dense, rocky, white head that leaves thick sheets of lace. aroma is amazing with huge, herbal, dank, resinous hops backed by heavy grapefruit, orange zest, apricots, and canned pineapple with hints of sweet caramel malts and honeysuckle as it opens up. flavor is outstanding as well with a big punch of bitter, resinous, piney hops up front that are balanced by orange peel, lemons, pink grapefruit, and prickly hints of peach, pear skins, and white grapes. palate is medium bodied with perfect carbonation and a dry, bitter, fruity hop finish. overall, an outstanding ipa that i wish i could get on a daily basis.","Norfolk, Virginia, USA","ksurkin"
3881,"2012-12-27",4.7,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.

Pours a slightly hazy medium gold with a one finger white head. Abundant carbonation allows a rocky head to be maintained nearly throughout the entire drink with tons of rocky lacing clinging to the glass.

Aroma just screams west coast IPA. Tons and tons of citrus from the hops and is very ""in your face."" Pineapple, mango, and tangerine along with a solid bready malt base. Really a mouthwatering aroma.

All of these wonderful characteristics continue over into the flavor. Tropical fruit immediately that just seems to spread across the mouth. There is a very juicy quality that I just love. Some light bread provides just enough malt to keep the hops balanced. High bitterness but not to the point of being overbearing or unpleasant. Mouthfeel is on the sticky and chalky side which I am not crazy about but it is a small price to pay.

Overall, an absolutely amazing IPA out of Ohio that rivals the best coming out of California. I am so happy I found this beer and plan on picking up many more before heading back to TN.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

Lots of great cascade and simcoe coming through in the aroma, with bursts of citrus and tropical notes paving the way. Flavor follows suit - lots of great pineapple, mango, grapefruit, and even piney/resinous flavors make an appearance. Malt backbone definitely present, but doesnt make it too sweet or overtake the hop character. Biscuity, and even some caramel-like malt notes play nice support roles. Hop bitterness explodes and continues to increase over a few seconds as you swallow the beer. Quite surprising level of bitterness for only 77 IBUs! Finishes nice on the palate. Not quite as dry as a true ""west-coast"" style IPA, but definitely not as sweet and somewhat malt-driven like a lot of Midwest/East Coast style IPAs. Good balance. Not prickly or creamy smooth carbonation. Just right in the middle, with a medium-full palate to back up all the tremendous flavors.

3881,"2012-08-10",4.1,"Growler shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike!

The beer appears transparent and orange in color with a finger of white head that leaves some decent lacing on the glass.

The aroma has a pleasant citrus scent, along with some floral and tropical fruit notes.

Very tasty stuff. Really easy to drink, Fresh hop presence throughout, with various flavors melding together nicely. The beer finishes with a tangy bitterness and lingers on the palate. Alcohol presence is muted, but this beer will sneak up on you if youre not careful. I would happily drink this again.

3881,"2012-07-06",4.3,"12 ounce bottle.  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both good.  Aroma is mostly pine and citrusy (grapefruit, citrus peel, tropical fruit) hops, along with a little bit of caramel malt.  I think the taste follows the aroma, it tastes mostly like pine and citrusy hops, with a teeny bit of caramel malt noticeable.

Pours a nice gold to light copper color with a nice white head and a good amount of lacing. Nice retention as well. The nose brought forward a large amount of hops ranging from citrus to floral to tropical. Altogether a really nice package from a mixed back of hops. I cant recall them at the moment, but there was a sign on the wall that seemed to indicate the hops used in this one. The flavor hit the spot as well with a nice hop character coming through as the dominant character and a good, brisk finish. A bit of alcohol in the finish, though not too much. Terribly drinkable.

Freshly bottled at the brewpub I took home a four pack of this and opened one the next day. It compares very favorably to the draft version which isnt much of a surprise considering it comes from the same source. This is a beer that everyone should get a chance to try fresh (much like the Pliny bottles) - dont let it linger or what youll taste will be a shadow of what it is supposed to be.

Aroma / Appearance - A dense head crawls up the sides of the glass protecting a glowing coppery body. Semi-transparent and shimmering in the light it has the hue of a freshly polished penny. Orange peels, lemon zest, fresh Christmas trees on a cold winter day, and pine resin hits the nose without any restraint.

Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and rich like the filling of a jelly donut. Bright hops tear at the senses with a resiny impression that holds nothing back. Zesty orange rinds follow the first bite before a comfortable hoppy finish. The overall impression is somewhat like a mixture of bitters, Orange Crush, and pine sol.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

On draft at Fat Heads in Cleveland.    I finally got a chance to try this one, been waiting awhile.  Hit the brewpub on the way home after a weekend in Cleveland.  You can tell this beer is extremely fresh.  Its exploding with aromas of citrus and hop resin.  Full flavor as well, with lots of juicy hops... more citrus and pine with what seems to be very little malt.  ( I was also lucky enough to try the cask conditioned version of this was just a tasty with an extremely smooth palate and soft carbonation.)  And to top it off, I was very pleased to find that they had 4-packs available, just bottle 3 days ago!

3881,"2011-02-16",3.6,"A: The beer pours a clear golden-orange color with a nice big white head and some moderate lacing.

S: Smells really quite nice. Plenty of pine that is very resinous along with a big grapefruit aroma and plenty of citrus in general. Theres a touch of grassy hop smell and not really much malt at all.

T: Unfortunately, the flavor falls off a little bit. Certainly a lot of pine and grapefruit, as well as a solid bitterness. Theres more malt presence on the palate and just a bit of a step backward in terms of the hop intensity.

Aroma: Citrus and pine, with a light floral aroma. Lots of hops--very intense and complex.

Taste: Light sweetness tempering a medium bitterness with a slight sourness in the back. 
Palate: Medium-Full body, Crisp Texture, Lively Carbonation and a long, complex finish.
Overall: This is an extremely well crafted and thought out beer. Its not over the top like some IPAs, but its not meant to be either. Its strong and developed enough to hold its own against the competition. A great beer for one to sip slowly and enjoy the many layers.","Ohio, USA","pottygok"

3881,"2009-11-13",3.7,"On-tap at Pizza Plant.Cloudy grapefruit with a foaming white head. Lots of lace. Grapefruit aroma. Initially there is a strong hop bite, nay burn, then the mouth gets more used to the acidity. The flavour is pretty good grapefuit. 77IBU.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
3881,"2009-10-14",4.0,"Sample at the brewpub. Clear copper pour with a medium off-white head. Citrusy orange and pine hop aroma with a touch of malt. Piney and orangy hop flavor with a hint of spice from the simcoe with a piney finish. Best beer of the night and maybe the best of theirs Ive had, but Id have to try it side by side with Hop Juju to crown an official winner.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
3881,"2009-10-12",4.1,"this was the beer i had a few of while at fat heads- super dank aroma and flavor- that ctz hop was overwhelming and awesome. nice lemony/citrus notes as well- bitter for sure, and got a bit tough in the drinkability department towards the end of the second pint, but nice for sure.","Williamsville, New York, USA","hopson"
3881,"2009-10-08",4.1,"On tap.  Pours a clear deep orangy/golden color.  Awesome citrus/pine aroma.  Hops all the way.  Great hop flavor, but not overly bitter or astringent.  A really nice, but intense hop flavor.  Clean finish with some malty sweetness that mellows out the hop bite.","The Land of Milk and Honey, Ohio, USA","Cliff"
3881,"2009-09-19",4.0,"Tasted on tap at the Bistro 12th Annual IPA Festival on 8/8/09. This IPA pours a medium orange gold color from the tap. Small to medium sized white foamy head. The aroma is floral and orange. A medium bodied IPA. The malts are fruity and sweet. The hops are floral and citrusy. Nice balance. Nice carbonation. Very solid IPA. Good drinkability. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
3881,"2009-09-08",3.7,"Enjoyed via tap at the Pittsburgh pub.  The beer pours a straw-gold to slightly amber color with a nice white head that lasts throughout the beer.  Strong Simcoe hop character comes through in the nose, evidencing some pretty liberal late hopping.  Some other west coast varietals come through as well, but they are muddled by the powerful danky aromas of the aforementioned.  The palate is unapologetically hoppy, giving a bracing bitterness that one would expect in something like a Stone Ruination or other very high IBU offering.  Malt character is minimal, but there is a very slight background sweetness.  Overall, I was skeptical that this would be up to the hype that has been around it in the Pgh area, but it delivers.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"
3881,"2009-08-18",2.6,"On tap at Bocktown. Very different for an IPA. The malt and a weird smokiness were the main flavors here, with the hops barely making a presence. Aroma was good. Light smoke with dark caramel. Pour was a medium brown with a one finger off white head with no bubbles. Taste was all malt. Near maple syrup sweetness with a stale smoke flavor. The hops come in in the aftertaste for just a few seconds. Very weird.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
3881,"2009-08-15",4.0,"The aroma was bursting with fresh, flowery hops.  Plenty of juicy citrus and fresh cut pine to please the nose.  Copper body with an amber tint, large cloudy head and plenty of thick lacing.  Medium bodied leaning on the heavy side, malty with a big bitterness.  Drinks clean and nice.  Caramel, nuts, and toast are soon pushed aside as the fresh American hop flavors step up.  Fruity, flowery, and piney.  Wonderful IPA.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"
3881,"2009-08-14",4.2,"Draft at the Bistros IPA Fest. My favorite one and its from OHIO, no less! Iced down in the large suitcase the five gallon keg came in! Nose was floral and piney hops, big time. Clear yellow amber with a medium glass lacing pale yellow head. Flavor was bitter, bitter, and more bitter. Excellent!","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
3881,"2009-08-10",4.1,"Tap at the 09 Bistro IPA Fest in Hayward, CA.  This won the gold medal and for good reason.  I got the last pour from the keg, FOR FREE!  Orangish-amber color with a white head and nice lacing.  Floral and citrusy hops as well as sweet malt on the aroma.  Flavor is sweet caramel malt, light fruits, toffee, and a sharp, fresh grapefruit/pine hop finish.  Smooth on the palate and fairly full with hop oils.  Really good overall.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
3881,"2009-08-09",3.8,"Tasted at the Bistro IPA fest. Pours a darker shade than most IPAs. Kind of burnt orange with an orange head. The aroma was typical of pine and citrus. The flavor however was very nice. Malt forward with toffee flavors and the hops finishing it out nicely. Very well  balanced and tasty. This one was a surprising winner for me.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3881,"2009-07-30",1.7,"On tap at the Bocktown, a really nice palce.  Looks like a typical pale lager.  Quite hoppy and fruity floral aroma. Rude oily mouth coating experience, who put the soap in here? Little if any carbonation. Too much for this lager lover. Lets all chew some green grapefruit rinds and sappy pine needles! Long bitter terrible linger. What can I say but; on style.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"
3881,"2009-07-17",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2013 7/14/2009:  Fat Heads Head Hunter IPA is chewy, thick, and syrupy.  There is just a ton of Simcoe and sweet tangerine hops pouring out of this beers aroma and flavor.  However, there is also quite a bit of sticky and sugary toffee malt as well.  I am starting not to like all of that sugary maltiness in hoppy beers.  Id rather IPA tend more toward the hops than the malt.  Anyways, this beer has a moderate level of bitterness.  Additional pine hop flavor comes out as the beer warms.  This beer has a medium-full body, a hazy copper-orange color, and a frothy off-white head, solid lacing, and random big carbonation bubbles.  I think quite a few people will really enjoye this beer and it is quite good, but the sugary almost cotton candy like sweetness that comes through at times is just too much for me.  I would rather have pint after pine of the Fat Heads S.P.A...

3881,"2009-06-27",4.5,"Sampled on draught at the brewpub in North Olmstead, OH. Pours to a golden to light amber color with a tight head that fades, and a good carbonation. Big aromas of pine and grapefruit flood the nose. The palate is firm, with good, crisp, pale and biscuity flavor paired with a very nice back drop of lemon/grapefruit and piney hop flavors. This beer ends with with a big smack of zesty citrus and pine bitterness that lingers. Excellent example of AIPA, hops abound in nose, palate, and finish. Really impressive beer, and a great one to pair with a number of dishes on the Fatheads menu.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
3881,"2009-06-13",3.5,"Refreshing IPA, very pale in color, little head, little lacing. Nose is all citrus & pine, flavor is strongly cascade hops, citrusy and only slightly bitter with a pine bite. Slight caramel malt backbone - Just a lovely thing with their BBQ.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","livelaughlovep"
3881,"2009-06-10",4.0,"Draft at the brewpub. Clear amber with a big white head and some nice lace. Big grapefruit aroma and resiny pine reflects the hop bill as described by the brewer. The aroma isnt jsut about hops, as there is some toffee and caramel in there as well. Very resinous on the palate as expected, medium body, dry and bitter. Some fruitiness with its attendant sweetness is quickly vanquished by the huge hop presence extending into a long bitter finish. An excellent IPA in the West Coast tradition.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"
3881,"2009-06-08",4.2,"This poured a cloudy bright yellow color with a big white head. Aroma was loaded with strong pine hops, mainly from the simcoes I assume. Flavor was just the same, just a mouthful of pine and citrus flavors. This is a real hop bomb for a regular IPA","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"

3881,"2009-05-07",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2013 [Draft @ Fat Heads] Poured an amber color with a small, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass.

Flavor is strong pine and citrus hops upfront.  Leads to a nice caramel touch with more pine hops to the finish.  A real hop blast.  My favorite on their list.
