1369,"2013-01-18",3.4,"Bottled.  Poured cola brown with a well-retained khaki head.  The aroma picked up sweet caramel, toasted rye bread, and molasses with vanilla bean accents.. smelled like it was going to be very sweet.  The flavor found sweet molasses and toasted black malts at the core, with light coffee bitterness and earthy notes around.. finished a little tangy, carrying through sweet black malts and a touch of earth.  Light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation on the palate.. smooth feel on the middle, and the transition to tangier edges was solid.. this was very drinkable.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1369,"2012-12-13",3.6,"Bottle - Pours deep brown with a film light tan head. Nose is dark bread, mostly dry with a bit of caramel. A bit of sharp booze, some dark fruit, and a touch of herbal hops. Taste is a lovely blend of dark bread and plums, with some nutty roast on the finish. Medium body, real smooth with a good deal of soft carbonation. Really easy to drink.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
1369,"2012-12-07",3.7,"Aroma is dark/earthy malts and acidic fruit.  The flavor is mildly roasted dark malts, mild sweetness and a big, acidic fruit finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
1369,"2012-11-14",3.3,"Draft sample. Dark brown in colour with medium carbonation. Somewhat neutral aroma of light nutty malts and a bit of herbal hops. Flavors are a blend of pilsner malt, wildflower honey, mild toffee and even milder roasted coffee, with a subtle mineral note on the finish. Medium to light bodied with a nice bitter snap on the finish. Could have been a bit more ""savory"" for lack of a better word, but a nice quaffable beer.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
1369,"2012-08-05",3.5,"12oz bottle from Atom, thanks Adam! Pours a clear, deep brown colored body with a pretty crimson hue. Finger-width, creamy, tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is nutty with some lager dark fruits up front with a slightly grainy pils maltiness, toast, and a hint of chocolate. Flavor is similar. Clean lager yeast and some dark fruits up front with a slightly grainy, nutty pils malt. Light toastiness and slight chocolate note towards the end before this finishes clean and dry with a light bitterness thanks to some roast notes and spicy hops. Medium length aftertaste following a light body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty solid schwarzbier. Clean and easy drinking with a solid, lightly roasted, spicy hop finish. Good beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
1369,"2012-08-02",3.6,"Bottle: Pour is mahogany brown with a thick tan head.
aroma is light roasted malt and dark fruit and walnut.
flavour is nice bready, toasted malt, nutty and somewhat bitter chocolate and light vinous fruit. 
Straight forward well made if somewhat nutty and sweeter than I expect a schwarzbier.","Lakeville, Minnesota, USA","Trev"
1369,"2012-07-30",2.7,"Almost black with off white head. Roast and yeasty aroma. Clean flavor with a hint of roast, not very interesting. Carbonation is a bit aggressive. Nothing special.","Minnesota, USA","Steasy66"
1369,"2012-07-24",3.9,"bottle, thanks to SS, dark muddy walnut brown, aroma of burning nutshell, flavor of roast, burnt nutshell, fresh picked mushrooms ,licorice and caramel notes,  earthy delicious beer","Dallas, Texas, USA","blutt59"
1369,"2012-07-06",3.7,"Pour from a 12 oz bottle.  Clear dark brew with dense frothy tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, a little spice and grass. Taste is sweeter malts, caramel, chocolate blending to a bitter roasted grain finish with a modest hoppiness. OVerall complex and rish, very drinkable, very good.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","Onslow"
1369,"2012-07-03",3.5,"Coffee like aroma.  Interesting for a lager.  Very dark stout like appearance.  Taste is very malty.  Sweet, spicy finish.  Very interesting for a lager.  Very unique and Im a fan.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","Mat42m"
1369,"2012-06-26",3.2,"Very dark brown.  Roasted malt and a surprising amount of hops.  When I think of dark Czech lagers, I think of dunkels and Viennas, not schwarzbier.  Dry hops, and it is somewhat lacking in flavor.  Still it is enjoyable enough.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1369,"2012-06-05",3.8,"12oz bottle pours a dark brown with a faint amber hue and a large khaki head. Aroma has grassy hops, caramel, yeast, chocolate, and roasted malts. Taste is clean and well rounded, spicy hops and bitter roasted malts. Easy drinking, a really nice Czech Dark!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
1369,"2012-06-02",3.7,"A deep ruddy red brown body with a light brown colored head. The nose is sweet with some raw dough and almonds. There is also some potato. The taste is toasty with some bread crust and a little bit of toasted almonds. Carrots and a hint of tobacco finish this off. A nice brew.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
1369,"2012-05-30",3.7,"pours dark brown which becomes a rich crimson when held up to the light. The head is light tan and lingers for the duration. It most certainly looked the part. In terms of aroma there was caramel, like toffee really, a hint of roasted coffee, though it wasnt harsh and in your face about it, and the gentle, soothing spiciness of Saaz hops in the background. I wasnt expecting the smooth flavours of bitter sweet chocolate to be at the fore in the taste department, but it was and it worked well, that roasty edge was there, like toast that is between done and burnt, and the bitterness of the hops kicks in at the end. I found myself sucking this beer down, well assembled, easy to drink and medium bodied, yes I liked it. Where I would put it in the spectrum of tmavé that I have drunk in the Czech Republic? Well ahead of the likes of Kozel and Staropramen, thats for sure, so on a par with Bernard I would say (for the unitiated, that means pretty damned good).","Gordonsville, Virginia, USA","Velkyal"
1369,"2012-05-26",3.9,"Very dark amber colored beer with a medium, off white, tight, well lasting head. 

The aroma is rich, malty, and nicely nutty. Some character of darker malts is subdued but very well finessed here, its got some chocolate and a mild hint of coffee.

The flavor is similar to the aroma, however more focused on dark malt. More coffee, less chocolate & certinally some herbal and spicy hoppiness throughout. A little bit of pumpernickel bread is a nice continuously present note to the flavor and some dark fruit lingers in the finish. The beer is very clean tasting and drinks very easily despite its subtle and well nuanced flavor.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
1369,"2012-05-11",3.7,"Bottle. Excellent brew - dark pour, gray-white head. Nose and taste of dark malts, a hint of prune, and spicy hops. Yummy.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
1369,"2012-04-29",3.9,"Picked up a single 12-oz bottle from Heritage Liquors in Maplewood, MN. Pours a clear dark reddish brown colored brew with a creamy off-white head that has some nice retention and spotty lacing. Aroma of both roasted caramel and Munich style malts, a hint of floral hops, and a touch of dark pitted fruits. Taste is medium bodied, nice toasted biscuity dark malts, and a touch of spicy saaz hops. The flavor and finish is when the saaz hops really shine. Finish has a good balanced malt and spicy hop aftertaste the slowly disappears. A solid dark lager with a spice hop finish is the best way to remember this beer.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1369,"2012-04-15",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2012 (bottle)  Pours a deep mahogany color with a medium sized light tan head.  Aroma is strong of musty lager yeast, pumpernickel bread, dark chocolate, and toasty malt.  Something else in here that comes across as plum.  Flavor has a host of dark bread dough that transitions to toasted grain and light roasted coffee.  Hops appear at the end to add just a slight zip of spice before quickly disappearing.  Mouthfeel is medium and creamy, and the carbonation is perfect.  Overall this is a really nice beer, and yet another tasty offering added to the Stag Series.  Would like to see this introduced as a regular, because the Stag Series price for a beer of this style will prevent me from buying it again in the future.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
1369,"2012-03-26",3.4,"Had this on cask dry hopped with Saaz.  A pretty enjoyable beer with lots of flavor, especially with the extra hoppy flavor.","Hudson, Wisconsin, USA","DasBierChef"
