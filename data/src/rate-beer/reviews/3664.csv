O- I almost paid $27 for a bomber of this but held off and got to try it at the taproom instead. Thank God I did because it was very mediocre. You get some of the barrel aging in the aroma and taste but overall its pretty unbalanced in my opinion and not much going on in terms of quality in it.","Ravenna, Nebraska, USA","HuskerTan"

Flavor follows the aroma rather closely with a nice caramel molasses feel, supported by bourbon in the background. Light vanilla notes are there, but not as strong as when fresh I would guess. Body is thinner than expected--especially after loving regular hibernation so much--but maybe a slight nitpick. Still some decent carbonation in this one.

3.5 A: Dark brown, near black color. Just a quarter finger of beige head formed, but didnt stick around long.

4.25 S: The beer and barrel really integrate well in this one. Leathery whiskey offers a light smokiness, a touch of mineral, apple orchard, and melon. The base offers plum, caramel, tobacco, raisin, biscuity graham cracker, light toastiness, brown sugar, and toffee.

4.25 T: Tastes like the nose. Barrel and whiskey contribute leather, smokiness, light mineral, melon, vanilla, and apple. Plum, caramel, tobacco, raisin, toastiness, brown sugar, toffee, and biscuity malts. The only issue is that Id like the overall intensity to be upped a bit.

3.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation, but lacking creaminess. Id also like it to be a bit thicker, but its still good overall. Booze is very well hidden.

4.0 D: Good beer, but not worth the $30 this cost me in Pittsburgh. I guess I should just be happy it made it out to here.

3664,"2012-11-21",4.4,"Pour out of 22 oz bottle, celebration for finishing a damn hard course in med school.  2011 bottle number 3061. Dark brownish red, no light through it, tan head, that lasts fairly well surprisingly.  Aroma brings notes of big Stranahans, no infection in this one for sure.  Dark raisin, plum, fig, dark chocolate/cocoa notes, hints of nice toasted/burnt caramel, toffee, slight spice in there as well, this has lots of depth and the Stranahans works perfectly. Taste is very similar but warmer, nice Stranahans notes with whiskey melding into vanilla, chocolate, coffee, burnt toffee, hints of the raisin, fig and plum but its a bit more restrained than the aroma, the whiskey plays well off the sweetness and finishes sweet, slightly dry and slightly bitter, but mostly sweet.  Like this beer, but it is honestly my least favorite of the three BA ones they do.  That said...its still over a 4.  Enough said.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"

S-- Rich and full smell. Buttery vanilla, rum, molasses, 
brown sugar, and dates. Just slight bits of oak in this. 

T-- Warm, melted brown sugar, butter, vanilla, rum, and dark fruits. 

M-- Mid palate is very thin. Kind of sad really. Get just short bursts of what it was. A bit slick and sweet and and a rum spice finish but just lacking zest and too many gaping holes in this. Not much of the barrel though. 

O-- Knocking off one of my biggest wants and realize I am getting to this about a year late. Flashes of how good this was does make this worth it for me though.

3664,"2012-08-10",3.9,"This was shared by Paul (King of all that is barrel-aged) last weekend. Thanks man!

Bottle 431 / 492

The beer is dark brown and for the most part, transparent. The tan head stands in at 1/4"" and leaves a decent amount of lacing in its wake.

The aroma brings sweet malt, alcohol, oak, caramel, toffee.

A very enjoyable brew, and a fine choice for sipping on the deck during the last days of winter. The beer is slightly sweet, with alcohol and barrel flavors prominent throughout.

The feel is creamy and smooth, remarkably so given the 11.1% abv.

Overall, a very tasty offering. Im glad to have tried it and would certainly enjoy having it again.

3664,"2011-10-12",3.1,"Bottle 190 of 492, 2009 bottling; sampled October 2011
A solid pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a one-finger thick, amber tinged, tan colored head that disappears down to a thin ring fairly quickly.  The beer is a murky, concentrated amber color, that shows more of the same just lighter in hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of sweet, toasted coconut and raisins, and perhaps a touch of sherry at the first.  A second pas reveals smooth whiskey aromatics, smoothly spicy oak that gets a touch more spicy once I move away from the kitchen were some food is braising.  This beer is clearly dominated by the barrel influence, there are touches of caramel, which mix well with the ample barrel vanillin notes, there is a slight savory maltiness here, as well as touches of toasted whole grain character and even some grassiness / herbal character somehow; though this last seems mainly to be contributed by the whiskey barrel and actually becomes quite prominent after some time (though it also has an ample green, pepper like note).

Up front flavors of caramelized crystal malt, vanillin, toasted coconut, toasted whole grain, touches of toffee and caramel mix together on the palate.  The finish is quite spicy, very woody, and even sort of has a green grassy or spicy herbal note to it; this morphs into a green peppery note as well as a lingering tannic bite..  The beer is fairly light bodied for its strength, though I am not overly surprised as that often happens with beers like this that get aged in barrels; there is some viscous character to this beer, and it even manages to linger a bit on the palate, but the spicy oak character ends up wiping the palate clean.  After some time, the finish really starts to taste like a whiskey, spicy, somewhat hot from the alcohol, and it even has that sort of fruitiness that I get in a whiskey or bourbon.

Not bad, but I was expecting a bit more; the barrel character runs a bit roughshod over the base beer.  If this had a lot more caramelized maltiness and quite a bit of a richer, hell even sweeter, body that could stand up to the barrel influence, this would be a much better experience.  The beer actually seems to do well in very small amounts; if I come back to it after a while I can take a small sip or two that maintains a balance to it, but it ends up getting thin, somewhat too spicy, and a bit too hot after any more than this.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Flavors largely follow suit, with smooth brown sugar and toasted toffee notes showing amidst sour mash bourbon, cocoa nibs, and vanilla laden wood.  A hint of raisin lends some fruity depth that isnt present in the nose.  The palate is a little thin for the style and perhaps a bit too boozy, though it does finish pretty smooth and round.

Pours a dark hazy mahogany that shines through as a dark amber with a decent head thats made up mostly of big bubbles that linger around the edges after a while.

The aroma is dominated by wood and bourbon...and not a whole lot else.  There is a hint of dark fruit and toffee but its tough to find under the barrel character.  There is also some stale, cardboard-like aromas coming through that puzzled me.

The taste is just more whiskey - tons of vanilla, oak and bourbon, which leaves a big burn going down.  Im finding a hard time getting the underlying Hibernation - no chocolate or brown sugar sweetness to speak of.  Maybe some dark fruits as it warms.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and very slick with a subtle, soft carbonation.  It feels and burns almost like a whiskey.

Im a big fan of the regular Hibernation and, to me, this isnt quite as good.  Its completely dominated by the barrel character, which overshadows the solid beer underneath.  Im hoping (and expecting) this one to age well and get better with a little time.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
3664,"2010-01-03",4.0,"2009 bottle 291/492.  The pour is similar with a somewhat clear, deep garnet color with an average, pillowy, frothy, yellowish-beige head which is somewhat lasting and leaves some drippy froth.  The nose is amazing with the additional sweet notes from the oak complementing the malt richness and the oak wood notes supporting the hops; notes of sweet oak, rustic/piney hops, hints of dried apricot, toasted caramel, light spicy alcohol/whiskey warmth, lots of toffee, some molasses, and hints of almonds.  The flavor is similar but seems to lose some of the malt richness towards the finish; fairly sweet and oaky to start with toffee, molasses, sweet oak, toasted caramel, light raisin, and roasted almonds but dries out with more than moderate bitterness and spicy whiskey notes.  The palate is nice with a medium to full body, soft to lively carbonation, and a round, coating mouthfeel but the dryness is a bit much.  Finishes with some toffee and toasted oak, whiskey, almost herbal, and lingering almond and pine.  I did like this one in a collaboration between two organizations which I love, but some of what made the original so great great was lost in the flavor of this beer.  The malt richness was drown out a bit by whiskey notes and the great bitterness from the hops seemed insignificant.  I am beginning to dislike whiskey-aged beers more and more because the whiskey notes do not always meld well with the beer itself, and this is from a whiskey drinker.  The original is so fantastic but this one is just good.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

3664,"2009-12-25",4.2,"Bottle This beer rocks! Murky, dark brown ale with little to no head. The aroma is a decadent swirl of coconut, caramel, and aged hops. Full-bodied and lightly creamy with fading carbonation. Sweet caramel, brown sugar and buttery toffee is balanced decently by alcohol and hop bitterness. Boozy, warming finish. So very nice!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3664,"2009-12-23",4.0,"750ml foiled cap from alagnak.  Chocolate brown with a haziness to it, the head is very loose, swiss cheese like.  Roasted nut, light cocoa, coffee, cherry wood, vanilla, toffee, raisins.  Lightly carbonated creamy feel on the body, really quite nice.  Sweet, soft chocolate prune maltiness, ashy coffee, cola.  I am really impressed with how this beer has held up to th barrel.  Not sure how the abv has jumped so much, but if it is in fact truly 11.1%, it is sneeky.  Thanks Chris for sending this my way.","Washington, USA","bvc"
3664,"2009-12-23",4.0,"Bottle from bvc yeah ho! Fucking Tampa! Nose is of coffee, chocolate, floral earthy hops. Bourbon and wood are there but more  subtle than many BB aged beers. A touch of alcohol shows up.  Murky brown pour beige ring on top, light lace. Chocolate, roast, earth, pine. Bourbon is there and provides sweetness. Vanilla, caramel, brown sugar. Good body for ba beer. Sweet malty flavors linger. Chocolate. Wood and sweet barrel notes. This is solid. Like how the base beer held up to barrel. I enjoyed this.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
3664,"2009-12-18",3.3,"750ml, pours dark ruby with small off white head. Nose of oak and vanilla, caramel, mild smoke. Flavors of vanilla, oak, caramel, with a vegetal finish. Thin body, just an odd tasting beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
3664,"2009-12-18",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 20, 2009 750ml bottle. Thanks to Shane for picking this up for me... Pours a dark mahogony caramel brown with a thin soapy light beige head... Assertive vanilla, toffee, and bourbon aroma with a lasting sweet sugary confection... Flavors of assertive whiskey and caramels with a peppery bitterness in the finish.  Thinner body and I dont recall the regular version having that much body to it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
3664,"2009-12-10",3.8,"750ml, bottle #311/492, with a big thanks to Brewthusiast!  Pours a clear dark iced tea color with burgundy highlights and a moderate tan head.  Aroma is milk chocolate, caramel, and light bourbon, oak and vanilla.  Flavor is more chocolate, caramel, bourbon and light vanilla and oak.  A bit thin too.  Not a bad beer, but was was fairly unexciting and hoping for more complexity.  Thanks again Travis!","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"
3664,"2009-12-07",4.1,"750 ml bottle poured a hazy dark brown with a lasting tan head. Aromas of whiskey, oak, toffee, carmel, vanilla, light spice and a hint of fruittiness. Palate was medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish.

3664,"2009-11-25",3.7,"750ml bottle, $25.  viscous dark chestnut body, small off-white head.  strong oak nose requires slight aeration and oxidation to relieve some of the petroleum and plastic notes, but after a short time these unwelcome notes subside (they never truly vanish but theyre at a low enough level to not obscure the rest of the beer).  the at-first brash oak tends to subside as well, and with a rich and chewy body only moderately struck by barrel tannins, the sweetened caramel malt core of hibernation tends to play well with the also-sweetened honey accented stranahans whiskey.  dense and chewy up front, oily and resinous in the finish, the core of the beer is somewhat masked, as expected, but again the whiskey and wood seem to accent hibernation more than it did with yeti (which clashed) or ruffian (which, while good, was overpowering).  overall its an interesting product with a few minor flaws but thankfully no major flaws, however it certainly lacks depth and at this price point, depth is what is needed.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3664,"2009-11-24",3.3,"750 ml bottle.  Pours a murky brown with almost no head (a vigorous pour produced a little frothiness that quickly went to a thin collar).

The aroma is chocolate and bourbon with dark fruit and molasses.  Smells a bit like a decadent rum cake / fruitcake.  There is a touch of fusel alcohol.  I can smell the original Hibernation but its been bourbonized.

The flavor is surprisingly subdued.  Theres some chocolatey bourbon and dark fruits leading to a bitter alcohol finish.  As it warms, a bit more flavor comes out - but it still tastes like watered down Hibernation with a splash of whiskey.  The mouthfeel is full with very little carbonation and is a bit watery.

Overall, this is not overdone with the alcohol like the bourbon yeti was.  Both barrel versions Ive had have been very lightly carbonated.  Im surprised by how subdued the flavors were for me, given how complex original Hibernation is.  Its interesting to try, but regular Hibernation is better, and this is not worth $25 a bottle.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"
3664,"2009-11-21",3.5,"Bottle #376/492 $25. I am a big fan of the regular version so I gave up the $25 for this one which I will say is not as good as the regular version unless you really like whiskey. It might be a shade darker than the standard version or maybe its just hazier. It smells like whiskey, alcohol, really an interesting smell. The flavor is really overwhelmed by the barrel-aging to the point that I can barely tell its Hibernation any more. Whiskey, wood, alcohol, vanilla, intense but just doesnt do it for me.
