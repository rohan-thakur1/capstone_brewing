2529,"2017-06-13",3.5,"Fles gedeeld door Inoven, geprobeerd in Volendam bij Roompot Marina. Het is een licht troebel oranje achtig bier met weinig schuim. Het heeft een lekkere zoet bittere hopgeur. Het heeft een zoet fruitige smaak met een klein bittertje.","NETHERLANDS","TomHendriksen"
2529,"2017-06-05",3.0,"Bottle, pours orange with a white head. Pretty high carbonation. In one way a typical no/low alcohol beer with the tree bark kind of maltiness, on the other hand theres quite some citrus and pine hoppiness to make it a good alternative to water or soda.","NETHERLANDS","MonsterMagnet"
2529,"2017-06-03",3.3,"Slightly hazy golden with small white head, that retains well. Aroma is hoppy, grassy, little buttery, light malty, and later more biscuits. Taste is malty and NA-like, but also mild bitter from hops, with a dry finish. Low carbo. Very good attempt for another kind of NA brew; far more taste than regular NA, thanks to the hops. You might fool people with it if they wouldnt know.","AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","DijkBier"
2529,"2017-05-27",3.6,"Oranje gele kleur met een goede kraag. Ruikt fruitig citrus, orange. Smaakt fruitig, bitter, limoen. Bittere afdronk. Prima.","Gemonde, NETHERLANDS","Bosbouw"
2529,"2017-05-17",3.2,"Oranje/amber kleurig bier met een dikke witte schuimkraag.

Aroma: hoppig, fruitig, wat mout en wat gist.

Smaak: fruitig, gist, moutig en lekker fris.

Zeer goed voor een alcohol vrij biertje. Heeft wel een apart nasmaakje.","NETHERLANDS","basjansen14"
2529,"2017-05-16",3.2,"Bottle. Deep golden color. Grapefruit, pineapple and oily grassy hops in the aroma. Worty, but the oily hops dominate. Herbal. Nutty. Pineapple. Nice, especially for a non-alco beer","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
2529,"2017-05-03",3.1,"33cl bottle at home. Somewhat hazy orange with a medium white soapy head. Light to medium body. Nice bitterness with quite some sweetness. Lot of hops, malts, sugar and tropical fruits. Quite nice for a NA brew.","Amersfoort, NETHERLANDS","DwarfeD"
2529,"2017-05-01",2.6,"Bottle from het Biermoment, 15 cl sample. Slight hazy golden to orange color, medium frothy head. Aroma of citrussy hop, sweet dusty cardboard and slight caramel. Soft bitterness, some cookie sweetness and the herbal cardboard of a typical malt beer. Decent try, but it still has the nasty dusty maltiness all the malt-beers have, even though they try to mask it with a dash of hop.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
2529,"2017-04-30",3.4,"3ccl bottle. Appearance: A Hazy orange body, with an average sized off-white head. Allthought the retention could be better. Aroma: grains, malts,and some nice hops. Taste: starts with grains and sweet malts, then some good hops and finishing with a decent bitterness. Malty aftertaste. A bit thin watery body, below average carbonation

Best low alcohol beer that I had.","Hoogeveen, NETHERLANDS","RW80"
2529,"2017-04-28",3.3,"Bottle @ home shared by Caesar. Hazy orange color, average sized off-white head. Aroma is a little grainy but also nicely hoppy. Tastes about the same: grainy a bit but also decently hoppy. A bit thin bodied. Solid attempt as a non alcohol IPA but I wouldnt buy a crate of it.","Oirschot, THE NETHERLANDS, NETHERLANDS","Benzai"
2529,"2017-04-15",3.3,"0.33 l bottle from Drankenspeciaalzaak van Haastregt/Lamers, best before March 2018. Slightly hazy, orangeish amber with a medium large, frothy, slowly diminishing, white head. Sweetish, quite fruity and moderately resiny aroma of orange, pine, tangerine and a touch of wort. Moderately sweet, slightly bitter, rather fruity and slightly resiny taste of mango, orange, honey, pine and some wort, followed by a short, medium bitter, slightly resiny finish. Almost medium-bodied, slightly creamy and a bit effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Best alcohol-free beer Ive ever tasted by far, still has that wort character but it definitely resembles an IPA without being as bone-dry as other examples. Good!","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"
2529,"2017-04-14",3.2,"Bottle from Speciaalbierpakket. Aroma is fruity hops, tropical fruits, touch of onions, some grapefruit, and soft herbal notes with some wort getting through the admirable aroma. Flavour is moderate sweet and bitter. Body is light to medium with the flat weakness you can expect from a non/low alcohol beer. Very well-brewed and drinkable for the style.","Steenwijk, NETHERLANDS","tricksta_p"
2529,"2017-04-08",3.2,"Bottle at Gekke Geit, The Hague. Hazy golden orange with a white head. Aroma of huge marijuana, onion, green weedy notes and light malt. Flavour is light moderate sweet and moderate bitter. Light bodied with soft carbonation.","The Hague / Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","kermis"
2529,"2017-04-08",2.0,"Bottle shared at Gekke Geit. Slight hazy darker golden with small off white head. Lots of dank weedy hops on the nose! Some onion too, light cheese, strong wort and sweet grains, some herbs. Quite sweet and medium bitter. Under medium bodied with low carbonation. Tastes like an unfermented IPA basically. Nice for the style but not very enjoyable.","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","Maakun"
