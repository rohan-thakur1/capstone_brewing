Not very sweet. Initial is typical Irish, a touch of thickness up front offering cocoa, roast, dry toast, and soda bread like dryness. Clean and fairly drinkable, with a touch of thickness as its giddy up. Middle shows touches of smokey roast, grains, and oatmeal. Some gentle smoked barley, touches of coffee, cocoa, roast.

1644,"2011-04-20",3.2,"On tap at Meridian Pint during their Bells Night of Darkness event. Served in a snifter.

The pour brings a hazy, medium-brown brew with a thin light tan head and a thin collar after that falls. The nose is pretty good with some fairly-strong chocolate dominating and being followed by a bit of earth, light roast, and a touch of vanilla.

The flavor pulls back quite a bit and there is some chocolate behind a flavor that is mostly a bit woody and earthy. Interesting, but not all that grand. Feel is a bit thin for what this is, though not by a large amount. Pretty drinkable in the end, but not my favorite. Out of the four new ones I had, Milk Stout is crowned king.

Pours a deep near-black brown with a grey-brown head that is refreshed as I sip from the intense (though not particularly prickly) carbonation within.

Powerful and very appealing aroma -- this is really something -- of salted Swedish licorice, fresh foam on a French press coffee, bakers chocolate. Rich flavor with the roasty nutty and slightly sourness combination that Ive experienced in this measure only with  roasted cacao nibs. A bit more sour on the finish, perhaps showing its age, but on the long end the chocolate and coffee comes back, leaving this beautiful aftertaste of a strong chocolate bar. Awesome beer.

Well-rounded and authentic chocolate and espresso aroma; tender and rich, leading into cinnamon toast and raisin.  Flavor bites with a mild coffee acridity, wet wood, black licorice and a soft touch of french toast.  Age has certainly affected it, but to no disastrous end; rather it seems to have provided a softening or tempering influence.  This probably fulfilled its purpose a couple years in, and by now has polished away some of the raw rustic  character of the malt.  Soft and rich palate betrays the glint of oxidation, if slightly.  Still, the remnant of roasts is bold; lingering, and glazed with a hint of red apple peel.  Graceful.  Thanks for sharing, Jeff!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Not sure when the beer was made, but I am pretty sure this bottle has a couple years behind it.Tasted, right from the cellar, at ~48° in an english pint glass. The color is dark brown , nearly black, with a short lived, light khaki head the just hugs the side of the glass now. There is some sediment near the bottom  of the glass, but it will not be evident until the glass is nearly empty.  The aroma is dark roast, chocolate, molasses, espresso. Smells good. The initial taste is roasted malt;  followed by more roastiness with mild, bittersweet chocolate and coffee and  light citrusy fruit flavors. The finish is astringent, acidic, and dry. The beer suceeds at being a dry stout. This is the best Dry Stout I have ever had.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Aromas of roasted malts, chocolate, wood, and coffee. Tastes of roast, chocolate, and some coffee. Flavors on the weaker side compared to the aromas. A very, very light sourness to it. Thinner body.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
1644,"2005-11-05",3.2,"Bottle, snifter.  Very dark-almost black-brown hued beer with a moderate, foamy, light tan head.  A little light colored for a stout, in my opinion.  Chocolate, coffee and roasted malt provide both sweet and bitter aromas.  Nearly as strong is a note of honey butter.  Following that, some prune, vanilla and vinous aromoas and just a touch of smoke.  The butter part is a little strong for me, but not terribly so.  Starts off with a moderate chocolate and caramel sweetness and a buttery/fruity tang.  Finishes with a roasty coffee bitterness and the same tang.  Mineral like sourness as it warms.  Soft, slick textured medium body with average carbonation.  Dry stouts rarely flip my switch.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Totally black, with thin, tan head. Potent aroma here, very roasted, plus? smokey, figgy, raisiny...Acceptable texture, though not too complex on the palate. Smokiness carries through, though.

1644,"2003-12-30",3.6,"Dark brown color with hazy edges. Vigorous pour produced a thin loose bubbled dark khaki colored head that crumbled down quickly to leave some spots of lace sticking and a firm ring throughout consumption. Aroma is lightly tangy and sweet of roastyness with touches of cocoa and coffee. Gains even more sweeter tones as it warms. Taste flows from the nose with the same sweet tangy sweetness mostly thats kinda dark cherryish or oaky, with a roasted malt overlay and some lightly playful notes of cocoa and strongly blended old coffee bitterness and light dryness creep off the end but the finish gets a bit empty before more light roasted coffee dryness and twinge slightly peaks again late. Feel is a bit thin with some wateryness in there, it has some peaks and valleys for sure, gains some roasty tanged feel and lightly velvety texture, thins out, grabs some dryness, thins out again, and then another nab of dryness comes in and continues to linger with some sweet notes. A weird ride and not all that great really, my first lulling disappointment from the folks at Bell's. And again I'm reminded of the Cherry Stout ""with a twist"" idea what with the Rye and Susie's Sweet Stout's being similar as well. How old was this bottle I wonder?

It had some light chocolate notes and the tones were warm. Reminded me of a porter minus the bitterness.  Good beer, nothing exceptional, could use some more complexity, but certainly a well made ale.2002 bottle consumed on 2/2/06  A badly needed rerate.  The pour still showed plenty of signs of life, a rich caramel-toffee colored body, vigorous, large head that was slowly receding to cover.  Light lacing and well unfiltered.  The nose has light prunes and touches of dry coffee, but is mainly rich, thick, earthy barley, with a touch of bakers chocolate.  The flavor has held up remarkably for 3.5 years in the bottle.  Little to no oxidation, just some light madeira at best.  Rich chocolate and barley, more crunchy, dry coffee and a smooth toffee-cream finish with little bits of bitter black chocolate to keep things interesting.  Soothing mouthfeel and a rich consistency, almost fluffy.  Rating is for this sample, as I dont really trust any of my ratings back when I had this first.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

All those aroma qualities coming through on the tongue. I can't stress the wonderful depth enough. Good chocolate loveliness.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
1644,"2003-04-29",3.9,"Somewhat muddy brown/black, smallish head.  Wonderful aroma, deeply chocolaty, lightly roasty and a bit bready.  Flavor pretty special too, nice sweet/dry balance, nice chocolate maltiness, some light fruit hints (raspberries?), extremely smooth, low carbonation, just enough hops at the end.  Another typically great product from Kalamazoo.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1644,"2003-04-27",3.5,"This beer poured a dark amber color, almost black and formed a off white foamy head that let circular lace as is subsided. An aroma of malt, coffee and chocolate. It has a flavor of malt, burnt coffee and chocolate. Some of that burnt aspect comes through in the astrigent finish, which is fairly light for this style.","Ohio, USA","Gunshy"
1644,"2003-04-02",4.0,"This is a light colored stout with amber shallows and a smooth creamy head. While I was at first taken back by the light color, the flavor rectified my hasty judgement. Dry but not rough, the flavor explodes with burnt chocolate and musty overtones and finishs with just the right balance of hops and dark malt into post coital bliss. Trumpeter stout has every right to toot is own horn.","Salem, Missouri, USA","humulus"
1644,"2003-03-29",3.4,"Rich malty aroma of chocolate and coffee.  Dark red-brown color, light tan head.  Flavor is malty, decent coffee flavor and a little chocolate.  On the light side, in both flavor and body.  Good session stout.","Boone, North Carolina, USA","Brodie"
1644,"2003-03-19",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2003 This brew pours with a very small light brown head. The body is very dark almost pitch black in color. It has a very strong coffee aroma from which you can almost smell the thickness. It also has a very strong coffee flavor.

1644,"2003-03-13",3.9,"Reading through the other comments, I was suprised to read how many folks commented on how dark this brew is.  This is the only Bell's stout that allows light to travel through it.  Thin chocolate brown with a tiny (and quickly dissolving) head.  No missing the java in the nose, but there is also a burnt quality to it.  The flavor is suprisingly light, with the roasted malts doing most of the work.  A little thin in the palate, but the dry-ness is perfect.  This is the stout to toast with on St. Patricks -- luckily I have 5 more.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"

1644,"2003-02-19",4.0,"This exceptionally dry Stout pours a dark mahogany color with a thin but dense beige head and thin lacing. Aroma of chocolate, coffee and roasted nuts. Flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted grain/nuts and a little malt. The finish is a little thin, especially for a Bell's Stout and is mostly coffee. Still another good Stout from Bell's.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
1644,"2003-02-06",4.0,"Here is a quality dry stout.  Try this one along with a Double Cream Stout to compare the two styles.  This is my favorite of the ""November Stouts.""  Trumpeter's Stout doesn't rival Kalamazoo, Double Cream, or Expedition Stouts, yet it makes a nice companion beer.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
1644,"2003-02-05",3.8,"dark as a wet muskrat, but it'll reveal some ruby blush if pressed by fairly aggressive incandescence. a plop of shrinking foam, cashew colored. it's awash with micro-fine yeast particles like a teaspoon of dust from a belt sander. the description claims there's threeeeee different yeasts used--but hey, i only count TWO, what're they tryin' to pull here?   productive aroma generates rich earthy tones: coffee and composting banana peels, dark chocolate and burlap, lots of roasty tones and damp potting soil. flavor is real groovy, daddy-o, with smooth creamy feel, sweet at first, with dried plums marinated in coffee and pinot noir, a bit of slightly burnt fudge, and a chaw of dark leathery gaucho chaps. then marvel as the sweetness recedes before a gentle ebb of bitterness. very good session stout.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"
1644,"2003-02-04",4.0,"A good stout, black death of course.  Can taste a hint of chocolate and coffee.  It honestly tastes like Bell's Java Stout with a little less coffee.  That's not a terrible thing, I was just hoping for something obviously different.  This was close.  Still good.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

1644,"2003-01-07",3.6,"This wasnt entirely dry - some mellow sweetness (dark fruit - maybe plum) and ""woodiness"" - o.k. maybe oak or pine - i dont know wood flavors.  Lots of spices in this, especially pepper.  I liked it, but it could be thicker.  (not that I would want ""motor oil"", just a little more to chew on please!)","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
1644,"2003-01-04",3.4,"My friend Portlandrunk got 5 Kalamazoo stouts in the mail and it was while drinking this one that I began to really notice the Kalmazoo signature taste: well roasted coffee and a touch smoky brown sugar or molasses. This beer was particularly dry (not like the rye or anything, but dry) and the signature maltiness blended really well with the rest of the beer. Not my favorite Kalamazoo but good nonetheless.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"
1644,"2003-01-03",3.5,"Probably the palest of the Bells stouts since you can actually see through this one. Great big roasty aroma, a bit of chocolate. Same in the flavor but a bit sour. Would be better if a bit richer and less sour.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

Smelled like roasted coffee.
Tastes like roasted coffee with a bit of chocolate undertones. No hop presence in the taste.
Low carbonation and very creamy on the tongue.
Not a bad stout but I like the rye better for a dry stout.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bender"
1644,"2002-12-23",3.1,"Didnt like this one too much. Too much dryness from the coffee. Certainly not a very dark stout. Better than a lot of beers, but not a bells favorite.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
1644,"2002-12-23",3.7,"Im on record as not liking dry stouts...even well-crafted ones! But this is a little bit different. Theres really fruit here (prune?)...not simply chocolate or coffeee notes; in fact, those seem subdued. I suppose this is off style in a relative lack of dryness but I liked it. Must be  the yeast strains.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
1644,"2002-12-18",3.2,"Good strong dry roasted nut and coffee bean flavor.  But huge.  Maybe even too much healthy darkness here.  I confess I like quieter, gentler stouts.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","brownalegirl"
1644,"2002-12-15",3.3,"Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy dark brown to black, dense tiny/small particles, bottle conditioned.

Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Fairly one-dimensional IMHO.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

1644,"2002-12-03",4.0,"The thinnest body of all the Bells stouts. Gerat sweet/bitter, dry, nutty, roasted aroma. The flavor was woody, roasted, with a strong nutty tone to it. Nice crisp, dry feel on the tongue. The color was medium brown, and I got no head off this one. Very nice coffee aftertaste. Im not usually a dry stout fanatic, but this is probably the best dry stout Ive had.","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"

1644,"2002-07-25",3.6,"A brown stout which is sort of light in color.  A dark tan had poured about a half inch thick which disappeared quickly but left some nice lacing.  The aroma is like roasted coffee and soda crackers.  A bit of chocolate and a lot of dry come through in the mouth.  A bit thin, but enjoyable.  A nice level of bitterness in this dry stout.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

1644,"2002-05-15",3.6,"A brown stout.   Black patent malt seems to give this beer its bitterness.  There also seems to be a sourmash quality to this one. A difficult on to figure out.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1644,"2002-05-13",3.9,"This is not a Pink Floyd Stout.  This is backwoods mandolin and flying fiddle fare, a big thumping stand-up keeping time.  Huge smoky inhale so you dont expect the hops to be such a force, but when they come - oh man!  Its like the banjo just opened up a wild solo.  The hops duel banjos with the smoky roast flavours, producing bitter fine edges.  Course, Im not always a banjo fan, and i dont always like a big hop presence in my stout.  But anyway, as far as Im concerned this is bluegrass beer.  But then, I play a lot of bluegrass outdoors in Michigan, and drink a lot of beer in the process, so Im a bit biased.  You guys who were looking for a beer to eat Pinconning cheese with?  This is it.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"

1644,"2002-03-13",3.1,"Crackerlike, brown bread aroma. Well, when I get to the taste itself its like brown bread crust.  Not from your 7-Eleven loaf, I mean from the good stuff down at the expensive bakery that you only buy when you have guests over.  Lightish body, pretty typical stout flavours, no shortage of hops.  I have to be honest, I was more concerned with how well this was working with the Pink Floyd than I was with the beer itself.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
