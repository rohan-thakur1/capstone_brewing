3451,"2017-03-20",5.0,"Goose Island brews a limited supply of the Bourbon County Stout. So limited that many bars place a restriction of one per person. I had the privilege of sampling it at the South Side Grille during their Goose Island Tap Takeover yesterday.

Pour: Half-finger espresso creme head. Black tar body.

Bouquet: Roasted coffee and cacao bean. Earthy, sweet. Caramel and vanilla bean. Oak bite. Smoke.

Sip: Coffee and dark chocolate. Buttery caramel. Toffee nut. Morphs into a molasses syrupy viscosity. And finishes with a bite of smoky bourbon. Bourbon flavor really opens updating as it breathes. Mid glass it bites like a rye.

Mouth-Feel: Luscious, full bodied, velvety, creamy like butter. This is a beer that is very in the nose you can feel it it your sinuses. It had that quintessential bourbon whiskey burn that seems to encompass you, and kindles a fire in your chest.

Overall: I imagine a nice steak, or duck fat braised pork chop going nicely before drinking this. This is an after-dinner beer, it is a show stealer and needs its own space to shine. Drink it like a digestif.","Haddon Township, New Jersey, USA","MeadMuse39"

Not the thickest mouthfeel but I wouldnt say light either. Medium. Overall not all too complex, balance is ok. The flavor is great and it definitely saves this one from being mediocre. In terms of overall quality its definitely missing balance, a little complexity and a little on the mouthfeel. Delicious nonetheless. I enjoyed this one.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Sudz4Dayz"
3451,"2016-12-15",4.1,"12 oz bottle dated 29 August 2014 served in a Belgian snifter. 
Removing the cap indicated a secure seal, but this has very little carbonation. This is not ideal for the appearance, but the low carbonation seems about right for the smooth, full, high ABV body. Boozy and woody aroma with dark roasted grains and molasses. Sweet bourbon dominates the rich flavor. Moderately woody with faint vanilla and coffee in the finish. Mild bourbon barrels and dark bread in the aftertaste.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

Apparence : Noire, léger col brun foncé sans réelle rétention sinon un anneau sur le pourtour du verre, carbonatation faible. 
Nez : Riche chocolat, vanille, bourbon, alcool. À un point, une image mest venue en tête: un brownie avec des noix grillées dessus! 
Goût : Entrée de chocolat à la vanille, assez sucrée, bois, bourbon. On a par la suite droit à une deuxième vague distincte dans laquelle le chocolat est noir avec une légère amertume pour contrôler le sucre. La finale est assez douce marqué par le malt grillé et le fut alcoolisé. 
Sensation : Plutôt dense, effervescence faible, chaleureuse, longueur assez bonne, alcool qui monte au nez (ce nest pas négatif). 
Bref : Je ne réécrirai pas lhistoire en disant quil sagit dune excellente bière! Léquilibre quon trouve entre le chocolat, lamertume, le fut et la présence éthylique ne sont pas loin dêtre parfaits. Exemplaires à tout le moins.

3451,"2016-09-12",4.8,"Alkohol:  14,3% obj. 
 Data butelkowania:  20.10.2015 
 Kolor: Nieprzejrzyście czarny, smolisty, jak na szlachetne piwo przystało.  

 Piana:  Tego parametru obawiałem się najbardziej. Piana od samego początku syczała niesamowicie głośno i nawoływała do szybkiego zrobienia zdjęcia.
Była ona drobniuteńka, delikatna, beżowa i szybciutko redukowała się do niewielkiego krążka. Po zakręceniu kielichem pozostawały tylko nieliczne kropeczki na ściankach. 
 Zapach:  Po zrzuceniu magicznego firmowego kapselka poczułem najpiękniejszy i najbardziej wyraźny aromat bourbonu jaki kiedykolwiek czułem w piwie. Zapach mocnej dębowej beczki, mokrego drewna i destylatu tego szlachetnego alkoholu.
Aromat był tak głęboki i piękny, że bałem się nawet zakręcić butelką, aby wydobyć kolejne składowe. 
Po kilku chwilach poruszyłem lekko butelką i zaczęła się kolejna euforia zapachowa. Czego tutaj nie było: potężna waniliowa petarda, lody śmietankowo-waniliowe, cała paleta najlepszej jakości czekolady i trufle z czekoladą.
Na dalszym planie rodzynki, śliwki w polewie również czekoladowej i tylko szczypta paloności.
Zapach mnie ujął i złamał mi serce. W tej kategorii oceny komplet punktów: 10! 
 Smak:  Nie mogło być inaczej! Smak jest potężny i wielopłaszczyznowy. Króluje tutaj beczka po bourbonie. Szlachetny destylat wyczuwalny jest w smaku już od samego początku.
Czuć także wpływy beczki, jej przemoczone drewno, dąb amerykański oraz niekończący się posmak waniliny.
Na dalszym planie pojawiają się akcenty czekolady nadziewanej, mlecznych pralinek, truflii czekoladowych, karmelu, wiśni i śliwek w czekoladzie tudzież baryłek z alkoholem w środku.
Z daleka wyczuwalne są także na języku wiśnie i odrobina lukrecji.
Zdumiewający jak dla mnie jest fakt, że jest tutaj minimum posmaków kawowych, tak bardzo charakterystycznych dla 90% RIS-ów.
Smak jest niesamowicie kompleksowy i wielowymiarowy.
Goryczka jest średnia z długim czekoladowym i likierowym posmakiem w ustach. Alkohol jest delikatnie wyczuwalny, ale nie wymagam od tego piwa cudów, w końcu to 14,3% obj. alk.!
W niektórych 9%-wych Imperialnych Stoutach był on bardziej wyczuwalny.
Jest on rozgrzewający, ale nie gryzący i absolutnie nie rozpuszczalnikowy. Nadaje dostojnego tonu temu trunkowi.
Faktura gęsta, oleista, bardzo zbita. 
Odczucie w ustach pełne, wyklejające, ale nie zamulające.
Wysycenie niskie w stronę średniego.
Nieprawdopodobny mocarz, wielki RIS! Wybitny przez duże ""W"". 

Wysycenie: Niskie, idzie w stronę wysokiego.

 Podsumowanie:  

Genilany, wybitny i jedyny w swoim rodzaju trunek. 
Nie osiągnie co prawda statusu najlepszego RIS-a w moim życiu, ze względu na fatalną pianę.
Z pewnością będzie jednak 
w Top 5 RIS-ów.

Mogę również z niezmierną satysfakcją określić go jako najlepiej wyleżakowane piwo w beczce po bourbonie.

W żadnej innej mojej degustacji ta beczka nie była tak mocno wyczuwalna, tak trwała i tak głęboko zaznaczona.

Piwo ma szeroki wachlarz walorów smakowo-zapachowym. Nie sposób ich wszystkich wymienić.
Jest tego mnóstwo.
Przeczytajcie wszystko powyżej, ja jestem pod ogromnym wrażeniem.
Takie RIS-y kocham najbardziej i serce mi się tylko łamie, że są one tak słabo dostępne i tak limitowane...:(","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

Cest SlovakSniper (je te salue bien bas mon ami) qui un jour ma proposé tout bonnement et simplement de men apporter une bouteille que je nai su conserver bien longtemps. Tout delle ma immédiatement conquis: sa tête de couleur caramel, son corps à la fois soyeux, robuste et délicat. Les chaudes vapeurs de Bourbon du sud américain, de caramel, de réglisse, de café noir et de vanille. Ne sont-elles pas merveilleuses? Puis vient le moment où je porte le verre à mes lèvres... Une chaleur angélique me couvre de sa blancheur protectrice. Un profond sentiment de bien-être menvahit tant le liquide est complexe et sensuel. Je crois embrasser les cuisses de Mademoiselle Irina. Je ferme les yeux et je déguste en silence, contemplatif. À ce jour jai dû déguster cette bière plus de 20 fois. Elle est pour moi la bière des Grands Moments et je ne peux mempêcher, à chaque fois que je décapsule une Bourbon County, de me rappeler à quel point jai convoité cette bière il y a de cela, pas si longtemps finalement!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
3451,"2015-12-15",4.7,"Poured into a brandy snifter from a 2015 bottle that indicated 13.7% ABV. Completely opaque, black motor oil pour with nearly no head, and an almost wine like aroma that you can smell just pouring into the glass. Once you put your nose in the glass and after it starts to warm, the bourbon & stout characteristics start to come through with a light roast, some chocolate, vanilla, and some sour mash. Wow the flavors! Sweet chocolate and vanilla with a very light roasted edge and only a hint of the alcohol that is in this big beer. Very soft drinking ale with a wonderful bourbon flavor in the background. Each sip reminds you of how big this beer is and is packed with sweet & sour bourbon flavor.  This just gets better and better as it warms and even room temp wouldnt be too warm to drink and towards the end of my glass, I only want it to continue.  Overall sweet, soft, vanilla forward, port wine like and delicately bittered stout that is a must for any serious connoisseur.","Harlem, Georgia, USA","Augdraught1981"

3451,"2015-12-06",4.2,"I definitely am conflicted rating this beer. I generally dont care for bourbon barrel aged anything. However, living in Chicago, and having as many liquor stores in my area who offered this to me early, I had to get as many as I could. Some will be sent to friends across the country in exchange for their local wares. I was surprised how much I liked this beer. The aroma is definitely bourbon-barrel aged. The stout appearance is undeniable, including the head. The taste is bourbon-esque, but it is sweet enough to win over beer-heads like me. It goes down smooth enough for me to double-take when I realized that I had two big mouthfuls left. Where did it go?? Im smiling as I write this... the 14.3% is definitely in effect, but not affecting my judgement. This is good beer. Overpriced? Probably. Delicious? Definitely. May have to reconsider what I ask for in compensation for my friends local beers. :)","Illinois, USA","Johntgrace"

Clear notes of smoke, strong vinous character with grapes and raisins, light delicate coffee notes as meet with dark bitter chocolate of the highest quality.

Not really complex, I suppose, but the stout flavor is there and the bourbon complements it really well. It finishes chocolatey and boozy as hell. Tastes every bit of 13% and possibly more.

3451,"2015-05-22",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2016 Time for one of the great classics of American craft beer culture, the original barrel-aged imperial stout, to which many more recent examples are indebted. This one was actually made to a recipe of which the brewer thought it fitted the added bourbon taste best - let this serve as an example to all the breweries nowadays which believe putting a stout in a liquor barrel automatically leads to a world-class masterpiece... Very dark burgundy colour, blackish but revealing its colour around the edges, with the expected thick yellow film stuck to the glass as it progresses; quite some fizz for this style, visible on the edges.  These tiny bubbles try to sustain a thin, loose, deep beige head, but cannot prevent it from receding quickly and even all but disappear in the end under the heavy alcohol dosage. Truly mouth-watering aroma, very strong and perfumey and reaching my nose instants after opening the bottle: cold black coffee but in a good, very aromatic way here, bitter chocolate, lots of vanilla-like tannins of extreme elegance, wet wood and obviously some bourbon, moist Cuban cigar, milk chocolate, kahlua, old dry sherry, subtle hints of bayleaf, banana liqueur, liquorice, rhum-soaked raisins, roasted meat and cinnamon, varnish and shoe polish as can be expected from such a strong beer but in an aroma this complex, I cannot see any reason to be bothered by this; if anything, it only adds further complexity. I am flabbergastered: it contains all the good things of a barrel-aged stout, looking for flaws is pointless and even insulting to a beer of this stature, and everything is in absolutely perfect balance - nothing pushes itself forward, nothing clashes with anything else. This is among the most wonderful beer aromas I ever had the honour to smell. The taste is equally amazing: a tangy candied sweetness as expected, setting up a line of communication with the finish, but still restrainedly so; a deep basic grain sourishness, a very fine and concentrated sparkle on the tongue from carbonation, a slight umami accent but remaining in the background where it belongs, a massive body but still elegant and lean in spite of the far-above-average ABV... Deep bitter chocolate malts, absolutely delicious, thick and oily mouthfeel and just the right dosis of coffee-like roasted bitterness in the end, blending in perfectly with the rest instead of manifesting itself too much. All the way in the finish, it becomes even more complex, as a noble woodiness sets in, drying tannins, a lovely peppery hop bitter accent which balances out the sweetness to the point of perfection, and a warming glow of liqueurish and very clearly bourbon-like alcohol accompanying the liquid down the throat without ever becoming burning or astringent, though its presence is hard to ignore. I had rarer examples of American barrel-aged stouts than this, with all their respective hypes surrounding them, but no matter how great they are, there is always one little detail which prevents them from being completely perfect: just a tad too much of the bourbon or alcohol, just a tad too cloying, just lacking a tad of roasted bitterness... But this one, the grandfather of them all, manages to avoid all that.  This is a truly divine brew - if there is a heaven, and I think there is not so Im drinking these beers here, Im sure this will be served there... I am infinitely glad I got the chance to taste this work of art. A great example, not just for its style, not just for beer in general, but for gastronomy in general. Kudos to Goose Island - the fact that it has been taken over by AB InBev worries me a bit, but apparently this 2014 vintage is as good as it could have been, so I assume the InBev bankers are not interfering with production here. Completely amazing and even better than I expected.  Update: I have also tasted last years batch in the meantime and it showed this souring infection that has caught so much attention - clearly not a flattering feature, but far less dramatic than I expected.  I nevertheless have to take this second tasting into consideration and therefore painfully have to downgrade my score a bit.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3451,"2015-03-06",4.5,"BOD 8/29/14. Pours dark as a starless night. Almost no head, but being barrel aged, this is acceptable.

Tremendous nose led off by bourbon. Underneath are dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel and hints of dark fruit (plum) and oak.

Heavy full bodied with a texture that goes beyond creamy to the point of being thick. Above normal carbonation with effervescence from the middle on. Palate perfection.

The flavor profile is World Class. This is quite intense in terms of bourbon and alcohol and results in the complexity being slightly muted by these intensities. Balance is reasonable, all things considered, as the other flavors pop in the middle. It begins with bourbon over a rich caramel and chocolate sweetness. As the bourbon fades, alcohol comes to the forefront. In the middle, the alcohol flavor masking effect fades and the complexity of this stout becomes discernible. Waves of vanilla, sweet chocolate and slight plum cascade over an oak background. The finish is a slow fade of sweet caramel and vanilla over a receding oak.

A: Very strong bourbon. Thats it.

A: Small tan ring for a head. Midnight black body with no red in the glass.

P: Silky smooth. This is the most syrupy beer ever, by far. There are some bubbles in the middle and on the back end, but not many. 

O: The bourbon was nice, but it was unbalanced. It was icky sweet like eating chocolate frosting with a spoon from the container. (Of course, err...Ive never done that). The mouthfeel is way too syrupy. It feels almost flat. The alcohol heat is not bad for it being 13.8%. Another thing that bothered me was what tasted like an artificial edge that Ive found in other AB-InBev beers. I hope, like a lot of people, that they arent messing with the recipe.

Pours a thick, syrupy, completely black color, with a small, soon disappearing dark brown head, leaving a very thin lacing at the edge of the glass.

Has an intriguing nose of earthy, scorched malts with hints of molasses to it, along with milk chocolate, vanilla notes and a gentle barrel infusion, providing a convincing amount of wood and slightly hot Bourbon, blending outstandingly well into the sweeter notes of the beer, building up a fantastic, complexity. A generous amount of toffee and cocoa nibs complete the inviting aromas of this beer.

Tastes of earthy, wooden, toasted malts, mingled together with an unbelievable chocolate creaminess, giving this beer its incredible smooth mouthfeel. Even though this is a sipper, it drinks fairly easy, as the alcohol isnt hidden, but a fundamentaly, well integrated aspect. The Bourbon builds up on the palate above the malt and chocolate foundation, inviting sweeter flavors of molasses, toffee and nougat to the taste, which not only provide a well fitting depth, but also are responsible for wrapping up any alcoholic burn in a very pleasant way, providing a rich, complex, slightly burning Bourbon character with oaken qualities to it. These then again blend well into the malts, leading to a sweeter finish, with a subtle coffee bitterness in the end, calmed by lots of bakers chocolate, exiting with a short, sharp bourbon bite.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3451,"2014-11-28",4.8,"2014 bottle poured at home. Wow! I waited in a line this morning (Black Friday) for a chance to try this one; it definitely did not disappoint.
Pours a dark molasses black color with minimal head which dissipated soon after pouring. Aroma is mellow sweetness with bourbon undertones. Taste is amazing. Smooth and slightly sweet, with immediate flavor burst of toasted coconut, chocolate, toffee, oatmeal, gentle coffee notes, with slight bourbon finish. This may be the best beer I've ever tasted! It is SO smooth and drinkable and coats the mouth with flavor that lingers forever. Well Done!

3451,"2014-11-28",4.6,"Bottled 10/16/14. Aroma is rich bourbon barrel, smoke, leather, booze, some dark fruit and a hint of black licorice. It has a unique, almost cigar-like quality to it. Very strong, masculine scent that can be detected as soon as the bottle is opened. Appearance is an absolute 5. Jet black and thick with a cap of dark brown foam that recedes to nothing instantly. Tastes slightly sweet and has alcohol heat from the bourbon. It also has strong oak characteristics and everything mentioned in the aroma, to a lesser extent. Great complex taste; the only knock on it is the booze burn, but some aging would take care of that and make it perfect. Palate is a 5+. Thick, smooth and silky.

3451,"2014-10-08",4.7,"Transfer from BA review on 1-3-14-

 2013 vintage poured from bottle into a snifter

 Appearance  The beer pours an almost pitch black color with a tiny brown colored head. The head fades almost instantly leaving a trace level of lace on the sides of the glass. Upon swirling the brew in the glass, its thickness could be seen, with fingers of the beer clinging to the sides of the glass and slowly receding to the bottom of the glass to its resting place.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is massive of sweet smells with caramel, molasses, dark fruits of raisin, plum and cherry, as well as a little bit of vanilla all there. Along with these smells are lots of darker aromas of chocolate and roasted malt smells as well as some other lighter aromas of coffee. Rounding out all these smells, and as the name would suggest, a huge bourbon smell as well as a nice woody aroma mix with the rest of the smells, producing a delicious, very dark, sweet and warming aroma overall. 

 Taste  The taste begins with a big roasted malt flavor along with sweeter flavors of molasses and darker fruits of raisin and prune. Right from the start, there is also a big bourbon flavor. The bourbon flavor is big and smooth tasting with lots of oaky and woody flavors mixed within. The bourbon gets even richer as the taste advances, bringing with it just a hint of bitterness as more woodsy flavors and a bit of coffee come to the tongue. Along with these increases in the boozy tastes, other sweeter flavors of vanilla and a bit of chocolate come to the tongue more toward the end complementing the other flavors nicely. In the end, with all the nice roasted, sweet, and bourbon flavors of the brew, a very pleasant and still very smooth, yet somehow very warming taste is left to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is super thick and creamy with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. The thick and creamy body are most fantastic for the darker and heavy boozy and sweet flavors of the brew, with the lower carbonation only enhancing these flavors even more. With the lower carbonation and super thick body, all the fantastic flavors really get to sit and coat the mouth allowing the taste buds to be bathed in all the delicious flavors and soothing the mouth with a fantastic feel.

 Overall This is a super flavorful, yet massively smooth and balanced stout with an amazing blend of bourbon, sweet, and roast flavor. A sipping stout like no other, and up at the top of my list. Oh so delicious and enjoyable.","","Darkmagus82"
3451,"2014-10-03",4.0,"A thin-head-pour. Seems very oily... and indeed; this follows up during tasting. Caramel malts, licorice and an intense alcohol burn in the nose. At first monotonous but enriching after a few smells and sips. Very delicate but poignant taste character, perfectly enriched by the intertwining of the alcohol fume - breathtaking in a literal sense, almost takes a mans oxygen away. Taste is slightly sticky in aftertaste, I detect some oak and a bitterness in the background. An oily stout from the malt extracts and barrel aging. Everything in this beer feels like being offered with moderation and balance, but still poignant in its simplicity. Lovely stout, really, but over-priced in Belgium (13EUR)..

3451,"2014-09-17",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 13, 2015 2009, specially aged in barrel for 5 years. [10-4-9-5-19] (4.7)

Deep bourbon aroma, smells right when poured all over the place, smell of the empty bottle is just pure bourbon. Aroma is vanilla, chocolate, loads of it, vanilla, oak and oak and oak. Its very very flavorsome, but the booze and bourbon overtakes it a bit too much. The stout quality and the roast is close to gone, and lean more toward a very very dark barley wine, loaded with vanilla, caramelized sugars - marshmallows style, plum, raisin with a big butterscotch bourbon finish. nevertheless, this is a great drink and very special and is indeed world class, but different, and even if it was like I wanted or expect it to be it might not be better.


2012 Vintage [9-5-9-4-16] 4.3


Aroma of vanilla, butterscotch, booze, chocolate and oak. Taste is a full chocolate with vanilla and bourbon very well integrated, not as complex, to begin with - but is obviously amazing. As it warms up it opens new flavors and aromas, molasses, slight salty licorice with more butterscotch to it, chewy chocolate cake with big caramel, it is a bit too boozy and thin.


2013 Vintage  [9-5-8-4-16] 4.2


Aroma upfront is bourbon - vanilla, lots of oak, coconut, almonds, salted caramel. As it warms up there is a slight soy character to it, and more licorice forward than other years, also more dates and plums, almost a rye spice from the bourbon. Taste is less vanilla on 2013 compared to other years, much more rum like, with dark fruits - blackcurrants, dates and plums, a bit more dark malt character, but less chocolate. Feels more complex, but more nuanced compared to other former years.

2014 Vintage [8-5-8-4-15] 4.0

Big oak and booze, not as much caramel as former years in the bourbon, back towards chocolate and vanilla. A bit spicy character, subtle cardamom, rye like spice. Taste is more chocolate and vanilla, oak tannin is very much present, a bit astringent like a red wine, and has notes of black currants and licorice, this felt thinner than I remember it, was probably served a bit too cold to begin with, which gave a bit worse impressions to start with.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","simont1"

3451,"2014-09-15",4.3,"2012 bottle. Ive had this lots of times, and from different vintages, but apparently never rated it. Pours pitch, oily black with no head. Aroma has a huge buttery, coconut, vanilla bourbon sweetness up front, accompanied by dark, chocolate roast, licorice and lots of dried fruits like dates, prunes, figs and raisins. Toffee, caramel and a bit of coffee as well. Taste has a big, boozy, vanilla-bourbon and chocolate up front, but is balanced out well by the more bitter roast, and a good chunk of coffee. Starts out pretty sweet, but as time goes, it grows darker in the chocolate, and the booze becomes more complex and delicate. Molasses and gunpowder comes through. Still a bit of butter, and besides that some port wine, and again all these dried fruits. A great balance between the powerful sweetness, and boozy, roasted opposites. Despite the lack of head, it doesnt lack carbonation too much. Body is thick and oily.","Aarhus C, DENMARK","Vestergaard"

Especially with the 2012, interesting and complex nose. Completely black and viscous with a quickly fading brown head. 2012 amazingly complex flavors blended very well together, toffee, caramel sweetness, bourbon/vanilla notes, soy and metallic characteristics all make their way in and out after taking a sip. Sweet/syrupy vanilla, but not cloying, finish. 2013 similar but not as complex, more of a single note experience, slightly sweeter and less integrated. In each, no sign of alcohol, just great flavors and a lot of sweetness/hoppy finish. Thick bodied, moderately carbonated.

3451,"2014-07-22",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 6, 2015 First enjoyed this brew in honor of my lovely girlfriend&apos;s birthday, this barrel aged stout is absolutely delicious, exceeding my already high expectations. This was a random gift from a friend of a friend, and am I thankful to have tried this&#033; both 2013 and 2014 vintage bottles poured a ridiculous dark black color with some dark tan head, looks like liquid dark chocolate. Aroma likewise is of chocolate but also vanilla, red fruit, and of course bourbon whiskey. Taste is amazing, fresh dark chocolate, oak, roasted malt. Finishes with a sweet caramel/toffee, almost like I took a bite out of a chocolate bar. Also bourbon accents like I just took a shot of Jack Daniels too. Just awesome, the only subtraction is for the boozy/alcohol bite that I would rather not have, but it&apos;s not overpowering. Oh and the mouthfeel/texture is perfectly full-bodied, smooth, and rich. I'm becoming more of a barrel aged stout fan, as this is among the greatest beers I&apos;ve ever tasted&#033; hard to find and only released once a year as far as I can tell, be sure to buy and keep in stock for special occasions&#033; Great dessert beer too.","South Carolina, USA","eRock_2013"

The aroma is mostly of chocolate malts but the bourbon liquor really cuts to the quick and rips through my nose. Dark fruit and yeast. The body is as full as it can be and chewy like gum. The bourbon on the nose is not as powerful in the taste but that hard liquor bite really cant be avoided along with the sweet chocolate and long bitter finale. Everyone loves this one and I cant argue with them and it probably gets my highest rating in the seven years Ive been on Rate Beer.

I get it, its the ""Grandfather of Bourbon Barrel-Aged Beers""....it certainly deserves respect for being a trailblazer. However, I just cannot get behind this beer like so many others seem to. It is just too big. 

2012 vintage. Poured into a Bells snifter. Color is jet black, like spent oil. Thick brown head that recedes into a ring around the glass with spotty lacing. Aromas of subdued bourbon, oak, anise, roasted nut and smoke. Much calmer than when this was fresh....I remembered smelling this 15%er from across the table before each sip....not so much now. The taste has muted bourbon notes upfront with a decent chocolate/anise interplay. It creates a bit of tobacco flavoring....which leads into the smoke character. Some sweetness in the middle ground....light vanilla, oak, molasses. But, the bourbon is still very much the centerpiece of the finish. It still dominates over any other subtleties this beer may offer....I can almost taste the delicacy in the base, but the bourbon just overwhelms my taste buds and palate. The beer being so oily, it resonates even further down my tongue, leaving little respite for any flavor that may be contained in the following sips. Just an exhausting beer. 

Dont get me wrong, I enjoy a gluttonous beer as much as the next person...but I feel that since Bourbon County broke down the door for Bourbon Barrel aging, other brewers have refined the style with more tenderness in the process.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

Served in a snifter. 15% an inky black viscous pour with ruby highlights & a thin ruddy tan head. Potent aroma of smooth bourbon, vanilla, oakiness & creamy chocolate plus a little bit of sharp booziness. Wow, very smooth body, creamy thick meaty mouthfeel with a ton of warmth as it pleasantly burns it's way down my throat. Meaty, savoury umami flavor, roasty, some cherry syrup candy like notes, bourbon, light oak, vanilla, coconut. One of the smoothest barrel aged beers I've ever had. Aged 2 years it is simply grand, I'd love to try it fresh though to see if it is as smooth!

3451,"2014-03-30",3.4,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance had a jet black body that leaves a two finger dark tan/brown head that quickly dies to a film coating the top of the beer, no lacing.
The smell had bourbon straight up, wow, mainly bourbon for the 2 hour sipping period, however, some chocolate did come out.
The taste was sweet and hot due to the alcohol and chocolate combination, sweet sticky aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, she sits a medium to heavy as the alcohol was felt perhaps a bit too much for me. Carbonation seemed spot on and did feel pretty smooth all around, probably would make a nice winter sipper.
Overall, well, it seemed like a bourbon bomb to me, but I would say that was a bit my fault for having it when I did, still I will say this is good for its style and I wouldnt mind having one again and hope its aged a bit more.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

T - Big bourbon flavor, thick caramel with a hint of char, huge vanilla and amaretto flavor, aggressive whiskey soaked wood, a complex mix of cocoa, coffee, sweet dark fruit, alcohol was more evident in the 2013. The finish flashes all previous flavors with a nice whiskey roundness.

M - The silkiest, smoothest beer Ive had to date. Carbonation is medium to low with incredible creaminess. Heavy and viscous body coating the palate with a velvety feel.

3451,"2014-01-08",4.7,"Bourbon County Brand Stout is one of those beers that has a reputation that precedes it. The problem with beers like these, is that they dont always live up to the hype, especially BA beers. I poured a 2013 BCBS into a snifer at about 48 degrees F.					
					
					
					
					BCBS pours like motor oil and generates almost no head, even when poured straight down the middle of the glass. The beer leaves impressive legs on the side of the glass, with a slight stain effect lasting for 15-20 seconds before it dissapears down into the murky depths below.					
					
					
					
					The aroma is intense, with dark chocolate and touches of coffee hitting you right up front. The bourbon character saturates the nose and leaves no question that this is a huge beer with lots of boozy character. I get touches of anise, licorice, and molasses present with other touches of vanilla, caramel, and smoke/roast present.					
					
					
					
					The taste is big, bold and boozy, with molasses and dark chocolate syrup dominating the tongue from the beginning. There are notes of vanilla and oak that come through the middle, along with roast and bourbon that scream BA imperial stout. 					
					
					
					
					The finish and aftertaste is almost entirely hot and boozy, with the dark molasses sweetness of the imperial stout shining through until the very end. Absolutely excellent.					
					
					
					
					The mouthfeel is lush and velvety, and there is enough alcohol presence that this is definitely a sipping beer all around. The palate is perfect for a BA stout.					
					
					
					
					BCBS definitely lives up to the hype, and while I wouldnt say it is the absolute best BA imperial stout Ive ever had (that distinction belongs to Founders KBS), its probably the 2nd best.

3451,"2014-01-05",3.9,"What a beer - considered by many to be one of the best beers in the world. 
I am not the biggest fan of oak-aging in general, but I will try not to be too biased. Oak-aging is normally reserved for spirits (40% alcohol or higher), in order to mellow them, filter out some unwanted flavors, and add some new ones (mostly vanilla). For beer, barrel-aging is generally not necessary and in my opinion it often does more harm than good.

For this beer, they brewed a very strong, flavorful stout, with an ABV that is very high for beer, but of course still very low compared to spirits. Thankfully, it stands up to the barrel-aging pretty well.

In terms of flavor, there is some smoke and wood flavor here, but it also has an almost overwhelming level of malty sweetness, molasses, vanilla, brown sugar, and creme brule. Burnt and roasted malts are there as well, although the classic stout flavors are pretty much drown out by everything else. At 60 IBUs, there are not enough hops to adequately balance out all of the extremely strong, sweet, malty flavors.

I had this at a tasting - maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I could spend a few hours drinking one bottle, to savor it a bit more slowly. But to me it was excessive, almost cloying, and a bit harsh. Ill admit that it did have the complexity they were aiming for, but I feel that they have sacrificed enjoyment in the name of making something bigger and more extreme.

It would probably be better with a bit less malt, at 11-12% ABV, with more hops for balance. As it stands it is a great stout, but certainly not the best.","Newington, Connecticut, USA","fishonmyplane"

3451,"2013-12-25",4.8,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2014 Bottle, 12/26/14, 2014 vintage. Great chocolate malt aroma with vanilla, oak, and bourbon notes intermingling well. Pours black with a thin caramel brown head and excellent lacing. Starts with rich chocolate malt with a silky smooth mouthfeel and a full body. Finishes quite smooth with wonderful vanilla oak and bourbon flavors with just a touch of booze. Delightful still, but not quite as rich as last years.

Bottle, 2013 vintage, on Christmas Day, 2013. Great aroma full of bourbon, vanilla, oak, and chocolate. Pours black with a caramel brown head that dissipates quickly and no lacing. Great bourbon flavor with vanilla and oak notes. Very, very smooth throughout with some chocolate on the finish with the right amount of alcohol perfect for a cold winter evening. Fantastic!

3451,"2013-12-25",4.6,"Poured into snifter. Was shooting for 54 degrees, came pretty close, possibly a bit too cold.

Pours black, thick and slow. Caramel colored thin head that burns off quickly. Black coffee in the glass with a thin ring of caramel bubbles at the top.

Wow. Smells like bourbon. Vanilla, oak, malts, alcohol, and faint chocolate. No detectable hops I'm the nose.

Taste follows the nose. Alcohol burn is perfect given 14%+ ABV. Perfect hops presence to render this amazingly drinkable and provide a slight bitterness, detectable through all the sweetness of the beer and the bourbon. A nice presence of oak too. More than I expected would be able to penetrate through all of this. The balance and marriage really is perfect. It's hard to pick individual flavors out because it works so well together.

Not overly thick but certainly heavy enough to chew on. Super smooth and pillowy. 

Awesome.

Gargantuesque, cest peu dire. Une première lampée me permet de découvrir une impressionnante densité de malts opulents.

3451,"2013-12-11",3.9,"2013 Vintage- The beer pours a midnight black, like motor oil. The beer appears thick and viscous, and forms a very small head of dark, oak-colored bubbles that quickly fizzle away to just a scrim. In body, the beer is opaque and impenetrable to the eye, though presumably free of particles. When swirled against the sides of the glass, the beer leaves a lovely set of legs. On the nose, this beer is boozy with dark chocolate, a touch of dark roast coffee, oak, vanilla, and chocolate covered raisins running across the nostrils. Soft toasted coconut and a touch of pralines and toffee also make it into the rich nose of this beer, but at its base, this beer is all about the boozy bourbon character which comes through beautifully. Im getting the sense of a boozy, chocolate covered pretzel for some reason On the tongue, the beer tastes boozy hot, and sweet with a drying boozy finish. The heat begins a little too hot but is smoothed out by the chocolate sweetness, while mild tannins dance at the finish alongside a roast bitterness, and just a hint of hop bitters as well before the booze makes one last hurrah. In flavor, the beer begins briefly as hot fusel alcohol, morphing into rich and boozy bourbon it develops flavors of vanilla and oak and then the stout comes through giving dark chocolate, raisins, molasses, and then chocolate milk flavors. The finish is hot with alcohol while mild tannic wood presses through alongside slight charred smoke, the finish eventually unfolds further stout characteristics, but only after the heat has moved down the gullet. A touch of char comes through in the aftertaste. In the mouth, the beer feels perfect for the style. It is richly full in body, like milk or even heavy cream, with a soft carbonation that is nearly nonexistent. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and silky with a thick chewiness that completes the beer. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left tingly with alcoholic burn, yet dry with only hints of salivation at the sides of the mouth. Overall, this is BCBS, a classic of the Bourbon Barrel Aged Stouts, and it is a great beer. I personally would sit on my bottle for a little while longer as the heat is a little too hot for me right now. The beer is rich in everything you want from a barrel aged stout, though, and is a damn fine beer. This is a whale worth hunting down.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

Aroma is like a bourbon spiked brownie batter... but man.. the bourbon punch is surprising.. thankfully I like some of Kentuckys Finest. a lot of whiskey and vanilla... but quite a bit of caramel and chocolate too... but it is definitely the bourbon that is the star of the show.. if I put my face over the glass, I swear I can feel the whiskey burn my eyes (in a good way).

Flavor starts out as a vanilla caramel sweetness but gets wiped off my palate by the bourbon.. melts slowly into chocolate with a little bit of char.. quite a bit of cherry.. almost like a kirsch.. but the cherry is fleeting as it transitions into a slick rush of bourbon that lingers forever. The body is very viscous.. accentuated by a lite little bubble carbonation.

This brew really is worth the hype... no doubt. I am keeping the drinkability down just a notch.. but it isnt a bad thing.. I want another sip immediately following the previous, but the thick mouthfeel and relative lack of carbonation hurts it for me... plus it still seems quite rough around the edges.. but still fantastic for sure.","Boise, Idaho, USA","JohnGalt1"

3451,"2013-12-04",3.9,"14.2% ABV. $5.00 exactly for the 12oz. bottle purchased from New England Wine & Spirits earlier today. Had it not been for my abrasively geeky questions, I dont think the cashier would have presented this years BCS as if it were the holy grail and I was part of King Arthurs crew. I hadnt rated this, nor have I ever consumed this, so I knew I might as well see what all the fuss was about. To oversized snifter, it pours a purplish deep brown with a quickly dispensing razor-thin khaki head barely a fingernail in length. Aromas of bourbon oak, mint, roasted malt, and hops. Huge and overwhelming alcohol presence. Tastes start with molasses straight up, followed by date syrup, chocolate, cinnamon, tobacco, oak, and burnt rubber. Blood orange peels, char, and pine needles by swallow. A tad zesty with undertones of earth at its finish. Heat experienced by first sip. This is a massive beer: complex, but perhaps too hot at the moment.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
3451,"2013-12-03",4.1,"08NOV13 bottle - 14.9%.
Aroma is super bourbon barrel character. Light chocolate and roasted malts. Medium high coconut, vanilla and almond notes with lighter bourbon and oak character. This beer really highlights the barrels and their contributions.
Pours black with a faint hint of a dark tan head that immediately disappears. No lacing and moderate legs.
Flavor is moderately sweet with a lot of dark chocolate and lighter roast and coffee notes. Light anise note adds a bit of complexity. Medium high bourbon character with lighter barrel notes than in the aroma. Light coconut and vanilla with a touch of leather and tobacco. Strong alcohol finish.
Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation. Slight oiliness to the beer. Low but present alcohol astringency and medium alcohol warmth.
Overall a pretty darn good beer, but the bourbon charger in the finish is a bit strong for me. I do not remember older vintages being this bourbon forward so maybe its a factor of youth as other bottles have always had some age. I wish it treated the way it smelled.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3451,"2013-12-03",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2014 An amazing & complex stout that has so many nuances & intricacies each year, I have tried to take notes on all of the different releases I have sampled. Appearance is nearly always the same, huge, black body with a timid tan foam that never seems to last for more than a few moments.
[2014 / tap / fresh] The bourbon on this one is exceptionally smooth out of the gate. HUGE chocolate fudge & brownie character with a nice amount of vanillin & barrel. Smooth, delicious. Probably one of the ""easiest"" drinking fresh BCSs Ive had.
[2013 / tap / fresh] Tons of bourbon on the nose, along with lots & lots of chocolate. Incredibly smooth, even with the heavy bourbon notes; very warming & full bodied. Mild roasty finish, light char & bitterness in the aftertaste. Nice vanilla character picks up with time. Lovely oak & bourbon throughout.
[2012 / bottle / fresh] Big-time oak & vanilla aroma on this one; the booze takes on more of a raw whiskey character. Bittersweet chocolate, lots of syrupy goodness with a mild roast in the finish. Oak, whiskey, & chocolate aftertaste, mild brown sugar.
[2012 / tap / 1 year old] Has mellowed out with a year, but the bourbon character is still nice & robust. Picked up a much bigger dark fruit (currant & date) character this time around, with a very deep & roasted malt aftertaste.
[2011 / tap / 2 years old] More subdued aroma than any other vintage, but very well composed. Bigger roasted char-like bite with a very smooth bourbon character. Nice chocolate fudge finish with some bitter roast & cocoa in the aftertaste. 
[2009 / bottle / 4 years old] Thanks, Mike! 12 oz bottle. Amazing chocolate aroma & flavor with lovely notes of currant & brown sugar covered black cherries. Bourbon is insanely smooth, lots of chocolate in the finish with a little bit of finishing oak & vanilla. This was simply fantastic, probably the best vintage/age, along with a couple of the 2008 bottles Ive had.
[2008 / bottle / 4.5 years old] Thanks, Jeff! Even with this age, the bourbon character is very robust but so, so incredibly smooth, it is unreal. This vintage/age showed the largest molasses, vanilla, & brown sugar characters of them all. Big chocolate in the finish, too, with lighter inclusions of oak. Tied for my favorite vintage/age of BCS, along with the 4 year old 2009 bottle.
[2008 / bottle / 5 years old] thanks again, Jeff. Very, very slight oxidation. But this is still a beast... Caramel covered chocolate bourbon fudge cake. Like a dessert with bourbon. Caramelized sugar finish, some vanilla, sherry. The last bottle was slightly better, but this was still great. I think the sweet spot for BCS is around 4 years.
[2007 / bottle / 6.5 years old] Thanks, Jeff! Carbonation is mostly gone, but that doesnt stop this from being a badass stout, even at nearly 7 years out. Surprisingly, this was less oxidized than a few, younger bottles of 2008 that Id had. Still a largely complex aroma of dark fudge, tangy dark fruit, very mild soy, oak, subtle molasses, brown sugar, & vanilla. Tastes like Devils Food cake drizzled with more fudge, vanilla, & bourbon. Dark cocoa & brown sugar finish, bourbon is smooth as hell. Outstanding!","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Opened at about 50 degrees, it pours pretty much black with a slight rim of brown foam of a head, it dissipates almost instantly. Not much carbonation, when I hold to the light and swirl I get slight nuances of ruby and brown. Putting this to my nose and I totally get the hype. I never smelled a beer or barrel aged stout smell so much like bourbon. As much as it doesnt make sense, it almost smells more like bourbon than ""some"" bourbons. Theres aromas of huge whiskey barrel, vanilla, oak, sweet chocolate, honey. Upon my first sip, I get sweet vanilla up front, then heat from the bourbon and then it finishes with tons of coconut and more vanilla. Amazing. After the first sip, I proclaimed this is the best beer Ive ever tasted! However, as I drink through the bottle, the ABV does start to wear on me a little. This is a truly special beer, but I definitely enjoyed the first half more than the second half. Toward the end I felt like I was in fact drinking bourbon or whiskey rather than a beer.

3451,"2013-10-01",4.4,"2012 vintage consumed this evening. Poured into snifter glass. 

A- Pours a jet black with a thick two-finger mocha head. It quickly recedes to a ring around the edge of the glass. Significant alcohol legs. Looks perfect for a beer of this style, very inviting.

S- Dominated by bourbon. There is some vanilla, roast malt, and a slight chocolate as well as coffee, but it is definitely minimal compared to the liquor aroma.

T- Up front there is more bourbon, vanilla, and some chocolate. As I swallow, there are some fruit esters, predominantly cherry with some fig, as well as a ton of alcohol. The finish is quite long, and the bitterness becomes present to help balance out the syrupy sweetness of the malts and bourbon. 

M- This is a thick and viscous beer, almost syrup in consistency. Although the feeling of the beer coats your mouth for some time, it is silky smooth. The only downfall I can note is the alcohol sting that you can feel almost immediately after you take a sip. 

O- This is a fantastic beer, but I think the 2012 still needs a few more months for the bourbon to calm down. It is an awesome beer, but I see improving in the future.","","justforrazors"

Poured thick and without any head. I get a thin ring when I tilt the glass and some alcohol legs. Nose is oaky, boozy, bourbon whiskey, smooth dark chocolate and some vanilla. Roasted malt and a bit of coffee. Tiny bit of dark fruit but I am actually glad that its not too pruney with all the bourbon barrel qualities. 

One very small sip to start and its beer heaven. This a smooth roasted malt, deep full and rich like hot melted caramel. The bourbon is luscious and because its hot from the alcohol has a sweet warmth. Dark creamy chocolate, buttery toffee, oak flavor and just a touch of raisin,prune and fig. it reminds me of english butter toffee candy thats coated with nuts and chocolate. It lingers like whiskey with a little burn at 15% abv and is full and smooth. 

Thick and rich, creamy and decadent. This is no lightweight stout. Coats the palate and the back of the throat and is a terrific experience. I would have this anytime. Sip slowly as its such a big beer. The complexity unfolds as it drinks.

3451,"2013-07-23",4.7,"I poured a 12oz 2009 vintage bottle into a snifter. It was bottled on 11/12/09. Im not sure how much it cost at the time it was bought.

Appearance: Opaque ink black all around. Perhaps some dark maroon highlights on the edge, but definitely one of the darker beers youll see. Initially forms a small coating of brown foam, but it fizzles away quickly and leaves no lacing.

Smell: Highly aromatic as it can be smelled from an arms length away. Massive black licorice, dark cherry and bourbon notes.

Taste: Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout is a monster of a beer. Even after three and a half years of aging, this vintage still packs a punch. Massive sweetness in the first half followed by overt boozy character on the second half. Black licorice, chocolate syrup, black cherry, vanilla and a hint of plum or grape can all be detected throughout the palette (in that order). To call it sweet would be an understatement, but to call it sickly or cloying would be a lie. 

Whats so impressive about this beer is the fact its so well-balanced. While there isnt hop character per se as far as citrus, pine, flowers, etc., there definitely is a prominent bitterness to this palette. This makes the beer drink like the imperial stout it is rather than any kind of borderline spirit other ""extreme"" beers tend to be like. The bourbon character is quite pronounced as well, leaving a slightly woody aftertaste along with hints of scorched sugar or vanilla. Sure theres a raw alcohol component as well, but it complements the taste so well I cant imagine this beer without it.

Drinkability: This is not exactly the type of beer you drink on a whim. At 13% ABV, and a high price tag, Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout is a special brew. That being said, savoring the experience is the drinkers responsibility. Its not simply syrup plus alcohol, its a genuine stout body. Thick and viscous in the mouth for sure, but not sticky or chewy sensation. Id describe the finish as clean if it werent for the alcohol drying out my tongue. A fantastic liquid dessert by itself - theres no reason to distract your palate by attempting to pair this with anything other than serenity.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

3451,"2013-06-17",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2014 Rerated. Originally scored a 3.8 when sampled on draft. 12 oz. bottle, dated 8/20/13. Pour is motor oil black with a thin wispy head that all but disappears in 30 seconds. Only a tight tan ring around the glass remains. Aroma is intense. Big notes of caramel, toffee, coffee, wood and bourbon. Alcohol penetrates the nose and sticks to the glass. Taste is big. Lots of sweetness, with caramel, bakers chocolate, bourbon and molasses. Big warming alcohol burn on the way down but doesnât resonate nearly as much in the flavor. Some mellow and smooth port notes shines through as it warms up. Enjoying this as much as the first time I had it which was before I rated beer. My first rating I think may have been on a flat draft from an old keg. Mouthfeel very smooth and slick with a creamy texture which compliments the style well. At $25 or so a 4 pack, some may be steered away, but the bourbon barrel aging really gives this imperial stout a complexity thatâs hard to find elsewhere.","Newington, Connecticut, USA","warhawk91"

Pours coffee black with brown seems and folds into a black hole body with a 1/8"" dark khaki head which crackles and pops to a swift moon phase death. A transparent ring encompasses the light crushing body with vivid amber highlights. Swirling reveals a wall of alcohol while dark brown stain surrounds the snifter. Looks as intimidating as a beer can. 

Nose of rich dark chocolate, coffee, and bold bourbon. The oak component attempts to smooth and blend, yet the hot alcohol and sweetness builds. Taste reveals a bourbon and chocolate bus rolling up to a metropolis of licorice and chocolate cake. Next stop, mocha cheesecake. Rum soaked dark fruits straight ahead. Syrup drizzled french toast sits on the horizon. I cant help but recall the whiskey butter I enjoyed this week at Nicas. Body is full, very liquor-ish, somewhat thinned by the massive alcohol content. Stinging, dry wood finish with sticky lips. The intensity is nearly unmatched.

After two years, the weight has increased, along with the sweetness, banana runts have made their way in, and the off-flavors are a little more obvious, the intensity is high, but the flavor transitions are unorchestrated, this is like drinking a death metal band, interesting, but not as enjoyable as the best barrel aged imperial stouts which offer much more finesse, pure flavors, and a balance of sweetness and drying components

Anyone else get that flavor? Such a great beer to sit and sip on, especially on a cold winter night! The alcohol warms you up nicely but does not overpower the fantastic flavor of this wonderfully well-crafted brew.  Cheers!

ABV:15%

Purchased at: Hy-Vee

3451,"2013-03-25",4.0,"Bottle from Kris Wines, 2011 vintage. Jet black colour, thin brownish bubbly foam, vanishes quite rapidly. Strong aromas, malt, treacle, hint of marmite. Full mouthfeel, ever so slightly oily, enough carbonation remaining to keep it drinking smoothly. Surprisingly smooth, for me felt a big beer but not overly so for 14.5%, roasty, hint of wood from the bourbon. Very good.","Greater London, ENGLAND","JorgeLee"

First impression; fierce heat, little complexity, high alcohol as from neat spirit. Aroma saki-like chocolate, soy and oyster sauces, semi-dried black grape, vanilla, oaked red wine...overpowered by bourbon. Feels a bit like a thinnish stout with spirit added; bullying hot whiskey; the burnt custard of bourbon demolishing dark chocolate, vanilla, dried black grape, fig, soy, grape-based spirit notes. Slightly souring background tang. Raki and custard finish with an unsophisticated waft of tongue-numbing, retronasal high alcohol. Raki and custard sums it up for me. Not especially pleasurable.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

3451,"2013-02-21",4.4,"2012 Bottle thanks to TheBeerSommelier. Poured from a bottle to a tulip. The pour looked like used motor oil. No head whatsoever. Carbonation is bubbling up from the surface like a bubbling crude. When a few feet away I can smell the sweet malts. When up close you get the bourbon, loads of it. Definitely a sipping beer. On the front end of the sip I get the warming alcohol feel. On the back end I get the sweetness of malts, chocolate and some coffee bitterness. The beer feels like oil in my mouth. Great warming beer on a cold night after work. I cant wait to try their other varieties.

Roasty bitterness on the sides of the tongue and a final puff of boozy vanilla oak up the nose.  Alcohol cools the sinuses for several breathes after each swallow.

3451,"2013-01-16",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2014 Straight in a tense, Burrbun burn - brownie sweetness and delicious. Peppery Cinnamon before a sticky spiciness, bunts of malt trench palate before a calculated sweetness. I could probably drink this all day. Its thicker/sweeter/woodieer but retains what I slammed down a year ago - nearly 53 weeks exact. LOOOVELYYYY As a dense pouring as youd expect, charred black with a plum tint. Wink of a tan broon head, surprisingly aerated that slips away meekly. Total whirlpool of equally distinct, sugary stout aroma, ash, and succulent dried fruit - like some really well soaked prunes, in a good way.
Initial taste kicks onto a high pitched chocolate, like sipping dusting off a frothy coffee before dunking into an elasticated vanilla and raisin moistness. Theres a seeping carbonation mid-glass that pricks with hazelnut wafer mid range which carries things far too quickly. 
Theres a big, vacuous gap between the settling of the dusty mouth-feel with the Oak laden palate and the dense gritty sweetness of some serious ABV.
Pleased to finally get a full dunt at a bottle to myself. Superbly packaged amount of ageing, booze and an overall smoothness that most high grade wine would struggle to match at this pace. Theres little sparks in at kick off but by conclusion theres not enough swell to the Bourbon throughout. I look forward to 2013s and tasting the one on the shelf before then, but would be mad keen on sinking into some of the variations on what is an inextricably enjoyable and expertly put together beer.

Taste is big and complex with everything I could want from an imperial stout.  Chocolate and coffee with the dark fruit not as prevalent but still detectable.  The bourbon shows up with a vanilla character and hint of oak from the barrel.  The flavors just envelope your palate and develop so nicely.  Alcohol is apparent but not overpowering.  Best stout Ive ever had and possible best beer period.  2009 bottle was smoother and the best.

Imperial Stout and Bourbon...how can that go wrong? It was a gift for my man Nate at WoB in Tampa. And he is so cool ...and he shared it with me :) Cuz that is what cool beer aficianados do.

The only head that exists is the thin ring around the outside of the glass.  It is a dark mocha color.  I had this beer right after it was bottledand just by the nose I can tell it has changed over the last 60 days. Aroma on the beer is big milk chocolate and toasted coconut from the barrel.  There is a bourbon oakiness present as well. Tiny bit of booze on the nose but it is very well masked by the vanilla. Also a hint of dark cherry.  The beer leaves tremendous alcohol legs on the glass.  The way that this beer has mellowed out over only 60 days is amazing.  
At the front of the tongue is an initial slight pop of carbonation followed by milk chocolate, toasted coconut, oak, bourbon flavors. There is a sweetness, from the vanilla, alcohol, slight dark fruit, cherry, fig, plum although it is slight.   Finishes with almost a bitter espresso flavor as well. Finishes dry.    Nice warming in the chest.  I really had to search for the dark fruits in this beer.  I didnt initially taste them, but when I really looked for them they are there.

3451,"2012-12-27",4.3,"Reviewed 12/23/2012. 12 oz (2012 vintage) bottle poured into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a wondrously pitch black color. However, theres hardly any head. Any vestiges of a tan-colored head fade quickly and leave almost no lacing. Really, weve got to start talking about alcohol legs when we get to this gravity. And theyre pretty impressive.

S: Tons of bourbon, augmented by dark fruits and vanilla. Not much in the way of roasted malts; it pretty much hits on the sweeter aspects of a good imperial stout, rather than the more savory ones. Its really not that boozy for 15%, either. Not the strongest aroma ever (due to the low carbonation), but incredibly evocative.

T: Sweet? Yes. Boozy? Yes. The flavor I notice first are stewed plums, raisins, and figs - this has a hell of a dark fruit note to it. Ultimately, it will finish with its trademark bourbon character and vanilla-infused chocolate. A slight note of smokiness will appear after a while. Its warm, yes, but given its gravity, the booze could be a lot worse. Basically, it has the hallmark character of a proper boozy beer - an alcohol character that blends with the flavor profile instead of clashing. This definitely bears a passing resemblance to FW Parabola, only with a lot more in the way of finesse and balance. The only thing missing is some complexity; thankfully, whats there is very enjoyable to savor slowly.

M: The finish is ultra syrupy, wet, and sweet. Very creamy in its palate texture, aided by the subtle (at best) carbonation. Some oak tannins come out in the late aftertaste in an attempt to dry the palate a little, but to no avail. This really is the type of beer that sits indolently on the tongue with massive, thick sweetness. You will NOT drink this quickly, so dont even dare - just veg over it for an hour or two and everything will be peachy keen.

O: Well, what more can be said? Its a big monster, but with enough deftness and sophistication to help give it a little extra something. On the other hand, there is enough harshness to suggest this needs to lay down in the cellar for a bit. Regardless, this is something everyone should try at least once in their life.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

The 15% ABV sounds high (and is higher than the past versions that Ive had), but its not overbearing, and it contributes to the flavor.  As it warms up, the bourbon becomes a bit more muted, allowing the other flavors to shine through to a greater extent.  For those that dig bourbon, this one is a winner.","Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA","TOSG55"

Very thick and viscous...just the way a good stout should be. ;-) Its very sweet but although you can taste the 15% alcohol its not as dominating as Id feared so thats a plus.

The aroma is very sweet roasted malt and some fresh rustic dense brown bread.  Fruitiness is mostly absent from the aroma.  The flavor starts beyond cloying sweet then a fresh espresso, one with a good bit of tang, takes over before ending with soy, roasted cherries and pineapple as if in a ham, woody, of a lot of bourbon.  The palate is cloying sugars, thick syrup, lively still, drying and tightness at the end with alcohol prickles.  The MF isnt very pleasant. Perhaps it would improve with time but this beer is way overblown IMO. Its good yeah but it really doesnt have much complexity or depth, mostly just brute force.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"

Cloying on the first sip, and it didnt improve any after warming up. No coffee/chocolate, the flavor profile would simply consist of dark/red/candied fruits and molasses if not for the absurd amount of bourbon. That, coupled with a relatively thin texture, means this doesnt even drink like a stout. I REALLY like bourbon (or any other whiskey), but I feel its used haphazardly here. I cant help but feel like this beer is all hype. One of my biggest beer disappointments.","","PHChikka"

3451,"2012-12-08",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2013 2013 release, fresh - opened first day available.   Just as I remembered it.   Aroma is thick, syrupy, complex, nuanced, etc.  It takes a while for the first sip, partially because the aroma is so good, and partially because its so imposing.  Taste is aggressive.  Its a little raw from being so new, but you can tell this will age well.  Buried deep within the aroma is coffee and roasted malts, but its smothered with a thick layer of syrupy bourbon.  Packs a punch in every aspect, and its so smooth despite its increasingly insane alcohol content.  Hoping to grab at least one more 4 pack and let these age.

This was much better than last time.  Not sure how much was the age (5.5 months), and how much was my improved taste.  I bet its mostly the age.  The flavors are still bold, but are now all within the realm of tolerance.  Pours a jet black with brown head thats aggressively fizzy and fades quickly.  Aroma is sweet molasses, bourbon, smoked wood, chocolate, vanilla, and alcohol.  Taste is sticky sweet creamy chocolate, building fast to a huge wave of bourbon and earthy, woody roasted malts, then hollowing out in the finish to a great aftertaste.  The age has made this go down much easier, and the ABV is a little less prominent.  Id like to age it longer, but its too hard to resist.  10+4+9+4+17=4.4

People apparently love this beer.  I must not be experienced enough to appreciate it, or something.  Im not well-versed in bourbon or any other hard liquors, and havent acquired the taste required to enjoy it. Pours dark brown, very dark with some red on the edges.  A tan, short-lived head.  Aroma packs a punch - super sweet molasses, vanilla, and tons of alcohol.  Taste is enormous - it requires effort to drink it.  Definitely a drink to sip slowly and (try to) enjoy.  So unlike any beer Ive had.  Absent the label, I wouldnt have even guessed this was a stout, or even beer in general.  Overwhelmingly sweet, syrupy taste up front, a small glimpse of complexity in the middle, but then right into a tidal wave of bourbon and alcohol heat.  Insane 15% ABV is obvious, for better or worse, in every aspect of the beer.  Good for up to 5 years in the bottle, and this was only 30 days old... so Ill let the rest of the 4-pack age for a while and see how that affects the experience.  7+4+4+4+11 = 3","Minnesota, USA","Ericular"

Sweet and malty scent-foremost aroma of brown sugar, perhaps some molasses and complex fruits/berries like date, raisins and currants as well (a little bourbon-like nose tingle too). Thick, syrupy mouth feel, very little carbonation. Bitterness at first, strong , almost spicy flavors/feelings of bourbon with oak, vanilla and strong cherry or raisin just slightly.

Smooth flavors of bourbon up front followed by roasted malts, dark fruits, licorice. Slightly more harsh flavors of whiskey booze in the finish. BUT not in a bad way.

3451,"2012-11-21",4.4,"First proper review on ratebeer. 12 oz bottle dated 9/17/12 into Duvel tulip, live tasting.

Pours solid pitch black, with no light showing through at the edges, a very, very thin tan colored head pops up for a moment before dissipating. Lacing is non-existent. 

Aroma is of coffee, dark fruits, raisins, bourbon, figs... 

Taste dives into bourbon, dates, vanilla, oak, chocolate, raisins, coffee and dark cherries appear on the finish as a mild bitterness that concludes with a bitter chocolate flavor...

Mouthfeel is oily, and Bourbon County goes down smooth, with just the slightest hint of alcohol.. Exceptionally easy to drink given the alcohol content.

Overall, not even close to a 15% beer, Bourbon county drinks fantastically given how ""young"" this stout is, I cannot wait to see how it evolves and opens up. Fantastic beer and absolutely worth seeking out.","Missouri, USA","Thingus"
3451,"2012-11-21",3.9,"Its been a few years since Ive treated myself to a Bourbon County, and apparently this is a special year-- 15% abv and all (ouch).

Holy cow the taste though.  Its like chocolate wrapped up in leather wrapped up in tobacco leaves buried under some musty black soil for a few months (though apparently they used bourbon barrels. . . ).

Totally worth it for the taste, and Ill cellar a couple accordingly.

But, in fairness, the drinkability is almost totally lacking; this is like 200 proof motor oil.  Gourmet, top of the notch, 10W-5 stars 200 proof motor oil.","","BeerSquare"

Plus, it didnt go overboard with the bourbon flavor. Its pitch black, motoroil-heavy bodied, and puts off a welcoming, roasted wood and slightly sweet aroma. All around a solid beer and one of the best Ive had in the no mans land that is >12%abv  country. This is an excellent beer to settle in with during or after a big meal. The slightly sweet, malted, roasted flavors would pair nicely with some turkey and stuffing, and it tastes appropriate as a goodbye to fall and a hello to winter.

Pours a thick black with only the slightest bit of ruby and a dark tan head that is really loud and fizzy and dissipates pretty quickly.

Smell is thick with bourbon, tons of woody oak scent along with some bourbon/vanilla notes makes up a bulk of the scent. There is also sweet smelling chocolate, caramel, roasted malt and thick alcohol.

The flavor is intense at the moment, it could use some calming down, it has a huge malt sweetness, tons of bourbon flavor, some dark fruits, just a large bundle of barrel aged maltiness.

The mouthfeel is very thick and the alcohol burns nicely.

It is a sipper, it will only get better with age, I also have an 08 cellaring, it will make a nice vertical once they keep coming, it is a great but hot beer when it is fresher though.

The warming alcohol is welcoming and comforting. Bourbon comes through massively with all the vanilla, coffee and chocolate all lingering around my mouth.

Taste starts with lots of oak, rum soaked raisins, chocolate, some coffee, bourbon. Then turns a little bitter from the hop presence I imagine as well as more chocolate, dark fruits, and booze. Do get somewhat of a soy sauce taste at this point. Really smooths out at the end. More of the same flavors, but the creamy finish neutralizes the bourbon/booze presence. The booze is definitely there, but it blends really well with the other complex flavors. As it warms, the booze mellows out and you are left with a pleasant warming sensation. The finish makes it.

Cellar Review: Bottled September 20, 2012 (9 months old)
Appearance: Pitch black body with no head despite a hard pour, only a thin tan ring.
Aroma: The aroma is a complex medley of coconut, sweet cocoa, caramel and bourbon. The aroma is a lot more complex and balanced than I remember it being fresh.
Taste: Theres a lot of sweet syrupy chocolate that makes itself known right away on the intro, this is backed with sweet and syrupy caramel and a prominent dose of roasted malts. Overlying this sweet malt base is a mild bourbon presence that sticks through to the finish with the oak to provide light tannins with alcohol noticeable on the finish that comes off a bit spicy.
Palate: Thick and syrupy, very little carbonation.
Overall: Very few beers that Ive aged have actually gotten better, Bourbon County Stout is one of them. This beer was a bourbon bomb fresh and 9 months later it has a layered complexity to it that makes me want to buy it again when it is released this year. Well done.

Palate: Thick and creamy, very nice.

Taste is about the same with a slight peppery finish in the 2011 vintage. The 2011 vintage is more harsh than the 2009 which had the time to mellow. Full budy. Damn rich beer.

On tap @ Lions Pride (Brunswick). + 1 for the appearance because of a medium fully lasting beige head. and +1 for the overall because the carbonation was pinpoint and the beer was a little more flavorul that what I remembered. 9-4-9-4-18

EDIT: Bottle (22 oz). 09 vintage, thanks to David for this bottle. Black with a small ring of beige foam and light lacing.

Moderate carbonation. Creamier mouthfeel than other BCBS Ive tried (including on tap). Thick. Light alcohol warming despite the fact that the alcohol is well hidden. Good balance.

2008 Vintage. 12 oz. bottle poured into a Founders snifter. 

A: Pours a jet black, slightly viscous with quick half finger dark caramel head that quickly dissipates into nothing leaving some slight popping bubbles. 

S: Im picking up the bourbon right away and its still fairly strong for being almost 3 years years old. This makes me happy. Im picking up some light oak notes, almost like wet wood chips, with very faint hint of smoke. 

T: From first sip there is a multitude flavors. Its a roller coaster of flavor enjoyment. The opening of this brew is a slight kick of bourbon with a charred oak smokeyness, like the embers of a campfire. Its smoothes out in the middle to a very light vanilla and finishes with an almost roasted coffee malt. As the beer warms the heat from the alcohol becomes more pronounced. 

M: Slightly syrupy on the mouth, heavy bodied with little carbonation. The brew coats the palate leaving an oaky and light dark chocolate mix. Minutes after a sip the taste still clings to the tongue. 

O: Wow. I saved this for my 100th review and Im glad I did. Im so glad the bourbon held up  and Im glad there was still a whirlwind of flavor after the last 3 years. This is definitely a sipping beer, no questions asked, and  A must for any fan of BA stouts.

3451,"2012-09-26",4.4,"March 28th, 2010 - Goose Island is proud of this one, and they should be. This is an ode to the style, a culmination of science and passion and personality, packed into individual bottles. Opening the Goose Island Bourbon County Stout 08 is like opening a bottle of pure, distilled artisanal craftsmanship. This is bottled joy, and I feel totally undeserving in having my grasping share in it, but since it somehow slipped out of its bottle and into a glass, I guess I cant let it go to waste. The body is deep black, but shows a light brown underbelly on the edges of my beer chalice. The aroma lunges from the glass, controlled but powerful, and at once vegetal, deep, and spicy. Smells of cobwebs, old wood, clove, all-spice, pomegranate and a high and dry bitter edge seduce me closer to the glass. The aroma is more powerful here, and under the control of the brew I take a light sip - a medium-heavy body greets my palate, and bubbles tickle the roof my mouth. Unctuous flavors of licorice and molasses crawl out of the beer, balanced by deep, dark chocolatey malts, and militating against a heavy oak quality and a strong-armed alcoholic burn. This is a glass bristling with intensity, where all the forces, titanic behemoths, are perfectly poised and balanced against each other, quivering with strength, but none of them ever gets the upper hand to upset this beers adroit flavor profile. This is masterful. Hats off to Goose Island.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Aroma has subdued brandy notes that still carry traces of vanilla however theres a more dominant note of rye bread, syrup and booze. No visible trace of oxydation in the aroma.

3451,"2012-08-26",4.6,"Bottle: I think I have to thank Soren for this one (has already been two years ago...)
So thank you Soren! 2009 Vintage (When  Goose Island was still Goose Island!)
Well this poured a really darkened black beer (almost that motoroil blackness again, but still at some points also that darkened ruby shine). A very small thick brown head, which unfortunately disappears fairly quick and after some seconds the look is a simple headless but black colored beer.
The smell is sublime, one of those imperial stouts which the barrel aging really caused a positive effect to which your nostrels are flathered, a smile is put on your face and even some shivers rise on your arms and back.
I am a fan of Bourbon Barrel aging, well if it is done correctly (never had any that was r
(really) bad), but this one is done very well!
The aroma is nicely balanced, with a nice mix between spicy, bitter, sweet: there are vanilla tones with some buttery undertones, there are hints of some spicy wood with brown sugars and sweet flower (lightly floral and hop) in the far distance, nice roasted ingredients like roasted barley malts and roasted herbs, some light bitterness but mostly its the gentle whiskey tones like wood, vanilla and spices. All the following are just hints in the aroma; mocha and flower (dough), tar and darkened molassess, syrup, slightest hint of something sour.
The flavours are a fine, pretty smooth soft yet spiced mix (but maybe a bit too much alcohol) of vanilla, wood, roasted malts, liquorice, sweet vanilla liquorice, full bitter, very peppery, roasted creamy viscous barleys, toffee, salty liquorice, some coffee/espresso/molasses mix, mocha/ caramel, toasted leaves, some dried liquored fruits (raisin, plums, prunes), some tar, wood roast and dark chocolate. Delicious!
After a while the liquorice comes very well through (together with the firm warm bitterness).
The aftertaste is warm with a firm malty backbone,  roasted spices/herbs, bitter, light caramel, mocha, chocolate, different kinds of liquorice, viscous and well balanced But unfortunately a pretty short aftertaste.
Low carbo, soft creamy light spicy mouthfeel, full body and a lovely oily viscous sticky texture.
Ok, you can drink it right when the bottle is opened and you can drink it after you let this breath for a while both are sublimely balanced and outspoken but you taste the difference.
I am happy I got a bomber, small bottle (355..) would not be enough, lol.
Guess the only things that withold me of giving this a 4.9 (a 5 cant be given in my optique) are the strong alcohol notes, that there is no head (its not bad if a beer has no head, but the (dark) brown head from the beginning should be a bit bigger and disappearing slower and not leave a headless beer after some seconds) and the aftertaste which seem to loose some of the awesomeness which is in the taste itself and is missed in the aftertaste. That said: its a wunderschönes biere!","Best of E-Town mit 2 Brauhausen, NETHERLANDS","Countbeer"

3451,"2012-08-25",3.0,"Thought I was ready for this. One of 4 things happened.

1. I was too drunk to appreciate it. This is definitely true, but still I didnt enjoy drinking it, struggled to swallow... though I was so gone I was horribly sick shortly after about 10ml.

2. My palate isnt ready for it. Feels true, but I spend most of my life feeling like a charlatan and hell Ive drunk loads of lovely imperial stouts Ive adored (well, about 5... is that loads? No.)

3. It doesnt taste very nice. Shock! Horror! But why? Tasted like a fortified wine to me (sorry, too drunk to remember any particular flavours... not sure why Im apologising, you dont care)... but as I have explained previously, I dont think I know what Im talking about... see... charlatan, told ya!

A-- Poured black, maybe with a splash or two of red. Half finger of dark chocolate head that fizzled to spotty film. A bit of retention. Visible alcohol legs to this. Honestly, pretty darned ominous looking beer.

S-- Smoky bourbon, vanilla and chocolate flavors come out. Bourbon drops off with more air on this beer. Booze is there but soft.

T-- Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate. Bourbon taste is not that bad, or imposing. ABV is pretty decently subdued.

M-- Rich, thick, and a bit creamy. Alcohol burn is very apparent in the mouth as it is still a bit hot. A lot more vanilla in the mouth and it finishes with a big bourbon kick that left my mouth very dry.

D-- Honestly this beer needs long term cellaring. With one year of age on this it is good but still a little hot. It is balanced well with chocolate, vanilla and bourbon but the bourbon is still a bit much. I have a 660 of this and it was a task to finish it.

On tap at Maxs.  Nose is all bourbon...but its delicate and I really dig it.  Sweet and smooth.  Outstanding, assuming you enjoy the sweet smell of bourbon...

Pours an oily black with thin head that leaves nothing but a bit that catches around the rim with tiny bubbles.  I swear the thing glows.  Lovely sight

Taste has the bourbon that youd expect, but really its mostly upfront.  It than changes all kinds of shape and you get everything else.  Chocolate just before the swallow, and then you get the hit of  bourbon on the actual swallow, and the the lingering afterward is all chocolate, vanilla and smokey bourbon.   30 seconds after after my first swallow I had to smile when the taste was still lingering in a big way.

2008 Vintage

A: Deep black with a thin, beige head that fades quickly, leaving no lacing.

S: Alcohol, roasted malt, bourbon. The aroma is huge and detectable from several feet away.

T: This is a big, rich beer, with a potent dose of bourbon, alcohol, and roasted malt. Wonderfully delicious chocolates also make up a large portion of the flavor. I find it to be very enjoyable and well done. The 13% abv is definitely evident in the nose and the taste, but the beer is so well crafted, the flavor doesnt come across as hot, just robust and powerful.

M: This brew could use a bit more carbonation. This would greatly enhance the overall feel, in my opinion. The feel is sticky, sweet, viscous, and chewy with a rich roasted malt and alcohol finish that lingers for a good while between sips.

D: The sweetness and high octane nature of Bourbon County Stout make this a great choice for sipping on a cold winter night, which is exactly what I did. While this is a nice brew I enjoy on occasion, I am satisfied with a small serving.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

A: This unbelievable beauty pours as black as night with absolutely no head at all. There is no carbonation visible except if I stare at the side and strain I spot a stray bubble or two pushing its way to the top. It poured like motor oil of the 10w 30 type and that is no exaggeration! I love the appearance of this awesome imperial stout. THIS is the way this style should look!

S: The nose on this gem is f*cking outstanding. When I popped it open and even before pouring I caught a few whiffs from the bottle. Now when I got my nose in the glass I literally got the chills and goosebumps. This smells wonderfully of sweet molasses, chocolate, figs and dark fruits. The bourbon has melded together with the other scents like a masterpiece. The aroma is so damn smooth with almost no alcohol to speak of. Where is the 13%?

T: It cant get much better than this! WOW!! At first the sweet caramel hits my mouth along with a cloyingly sweet molasses. I get the bourbon but like the smell it is so damn smooth and not overpowering at all. I love the chocolate notes flirting with the vanilla notes from the barrels. The dark fruits come out mid sip and in the finale the alcohol makes itself known but does not burn. I mean there is absolutely no burn from the alcohol like youd think at 13%. It has aged perfectly and the heat is GONE!

M: Perfection and this is not an understatement IMO. The viscosity is lovely as it coates every nook and cranny of my mouth including on the swallow. This is so smooth for a huge beer I cant describe it. This baby lingers forever and even coates my lips as I take a drink. I do get that wonderful alcohol warming sensation after a while as it is now hitting my head. This beer has the perfect mouthfeel for its style for me. It is chewy, thick and oh so good!

The mouth is creamy smooth. No carbonation bite at all. This is a big-time bourbon beer! Huge sweet vanilla notes, some oak, and malted chocolate.

3451,"2012-04-09",3.8,"Bottle (14,5% ABV). An opaque black beer, with a small, fully diminishing brown head. The aroma is heavily malty (roasted/burnt grain, caramel, chocolate, molasses, touch of coffee), with strong notes of bourbon and vanilla, other notes of alcohol, raisin, dark fruits, smoked/burnt wood. The flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Full body, sticky/syrupy/thick texture, soft carbonation, very long finish with moderate bitterness, heavily alcoholic. On one hand the aroma is simply amazing (complex, of course very bourboney, yet enough ""beery"" and super palesant), on the other, flavor and mouthfeel are super sweet, dense and syrupy to the point of being cloying after 5-6oz.

I had to put my nose to my snifter several times to confirm all of the aromas it is pulling.  It found caramel, chocolate, chocolate, coffee, toast, resin, butterscotch, licorice, soy sauce, vanilla, and woody notes.

A sip reveals medium sweetness that turns into slight bitterness and lingering umami as it rolls across my tongue.  Its body is full with a thick, creamy, and sticky texture.

3451,"2012-02-17",4.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/19/2008.

Had to have two of these before I felt comfortable reviewing it. 
Poured from a bottle into a goblet.

It is amazing how thick this stout actually pours - a chocolate brown, nearly black. A dark caramel color appears around the edges of the glass, but there is no chance any light is going to make it through. 

Quite a smoky smell overlaying the other aromas: chocolate, molasses, and some soft vanilla. Overpowering. 

The power bourbon county stout employs is phenomenal. The smokiness is the overlying characteristic of the entire sip, but flavors abound. The chocolate my nose devoured is slightly less apparent in the taste, but strong caramel, some light coffee, and vanilla flavors are all present. The toasted malt is stronger than any other flavors for the first few seconds. Finally, the bourbon comes through, with a strong alcohol taste. The 13% ABV definitely makes itself known, and it burns a little as it slides down my throat. The strong smokey flavor ensures that I finish my sip out on a toasted, almost burnt malty note. Incredibly intense.

As thick as a milkshake, it has a creamy feel with low carbonation. This stout is so thick it actually takes a few seconds to melt in my mouth. 

This is defniitely one to sip on. The brewers dont know of a cigar that can hold up to the bourbon county stout, and I could not pick anything, much less a cigar, that does. Everything fades in its presence...

I have not encountered a beer with such an intense flavor. I took almost 2 hours to drink the first one, and the second one was not much quicker. Impossible to session, but extremely enjoyable as a single glass. It is very difficult to rate this beer, as it is very different than other beers I have tasted. I am also curious how it will age; will the flavors become more subtle, and will the bourbon flavor blend with the other tastes? Overall a fascinating beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
3451,"2012-02-15",4.4,"2008 vintage. Thanks to MSUBulldog25 (BA) for this. 
Black as oil. Pours like it too. No head what so ever. Thanks to the etching on my NB balloon tulip I can see a dark head trying to come thru. 
The smell is an incredible dark chocolate aroma. Bits of boozyness in the background.
The taste is more of the same. Dark chocolate and bits of alcohol. 
Expect the mouthfeel of this to be huge. It covers your mouth with chocolate goodness and doesnt go away anytime soon.
Overall, this is a good beer. Very sweet. The 13% abv is non-existent. This is an after dinner sipper. And I will love every sip.","Oregon, USA","MADhombrewer"

The beer was nice and creamy with good smooth bourbon flavor that lasted all the way to the finish. Some licorice flavor develops and some dark chocolate.

Many thanks to MordorMongo on BeerAdvocate for this, and so many other phenomenal beers.

Pours a dark, ominous sludge.  A thin fizzy cap of light chocolate head dissipates to a ring within a minute.

Smells dangerous.  Surprisingly little booze that I notice, even at a relatively low temperature.  Sweet caramel, molasses, toffee, sweet bourbon of course, earthy foundation.

Here we go.  God DAMN.  The best part hits you right off the bat - thick, sweet cloying caramel, chocolate, fading into a sweet bourbon burn with a candy-like oil slick finish.  The mouthfeel is so perfectly in line with the taste that its nearly impossible for me to consider the two independent of one another.  The feel is perfect in my mind - tons of substance, really appropriate for the taste.  I love nothing more than experiencing the way that brewers utilize and grapple with high alcohol content - these guys have absolutely nailed the art of it.

The aroma is big chocolate brownie, bourbon, vanilla, a lot of alcohol, and some roast.  The aroma is sweet and boozy.  The initial taste is sweet brownie.  Then some roast, booze, bourbon, and a bit of vanilla.  The finish is really boozy with some bitterness and has a warming feeling.  Full bodied with low carbonation.  I did not find this very enjoyable.  It is cloyingly sweet and extremely boozy, even two years after bottling.  I found the sweetness to overwhelm the other flavors present.  Drinking more than an ounce or two is a chore.","Berkeley, California, USA","jethrodium"
3451,"2011-12-26",4.6,"2011 version. Merry Xmas to me! Yes, this pours jet black, the slightest brown highlights around the edge. Nose is toffee, vanilla, oak, and bourbon. Taste is very rich, moderately sweet with plenty of bourbon barrel. Palate is smooth smooth smooth with hardly any alcohol burn at 14.5%. The alcohol hits the dome about half way through it, but until then its not noticeable. Glad I found a bottle as this is hard to come by. I dont think I would go crazy trying to locate one, as there are so many bourbon barrel stouts out there now, but I will say Goose Island has pretty much perfected what theyre doing with this.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"

3451,"2011-12-17",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 29, 2014 2011 tasting in 2011: Of note, I do like bourbon and I do like stouts. This pours a very dark brown, not quite opaque with medium head. Smells highly of bourbon, caramel.  Medium body that is not overcarbonated. Tastes very strongly of bourbon upfront an in the finish.  Caramilized sugar sweetness up front with very boozy finish.  Again, I like bourbon, but I think there is more bourbon influence than beer in this. 

2014 tasted in 2014. Rating based on most recent release.

Pours dark black with tan head, small with moderate lacing.  Complex aroma of a little oak, lots of bourbon, licorice, coffee, a little clove. dark chocolate. Smooth, silky, full body with just the right amount of carbonation. A bit boozy, but well balanced given the age of this beer. Long mildly bitter and bourbon finish. This is great. 

2013 Tasting in 2013: Pours an opaque black with reddish brown head that leaves moderate lacing. Aroma of sweet, bourbon, oak, boozy. Hints of vanilla, cherry. Moderately sweet with a hint of bitterness. I suspect this beer will mellow out nicely. Full body with soft carbonation. Long bourbon finish.","Dedham, Massachusetts, USA","musinj6"
3451,"2011-12-12",3.5,"12 oz into HFB stemware, 2010. Pours a midnight black, tiger eye around the edges...not even a bubble. As the name suggests, BCBS has a distinct bourbon aroma and a bit of sweet malts(very slight). Taste follows nose with additions of roast, slight char, and sweet toffee. Although carbonation is very low to non-existant, the full body helps to carry the high ABV and heavy bourbon tones quite well. I find this vintage pretty harsh and young, I am looking forward to trying my other bottle a few years down the road.","Mount Misery, Valley Forge, ","LIVEFAST"
3451,"2011-12-10",4.4,"2011 -- Pours as black as can be.. the tiny head is a great burnt caramel color.  Smells STRONG of bourbon, oak, and maybe a hint of chocolate.  Can smell it from 4 feet away.  Unbelievable mouthfeel for 14.5% -- dangerously smooth, just a tad bitter.  Nice and thick, almost chewable.  Taste is not as strong w/ the bourbon as the aroma is -- its got a hint of vanilla and a decent amount of caramel in there.  Great taste. Very little alcohol on the taste.  Awesome stout.","Delaware, USA","Bricks"
3451,"2011-12-10",4.0,"Chevy Chase, DC 12oz ($6): Pours a black color with a minimal brown head. Aroma is coffee, chocolate, vanilla, whiskey, and burning. Really, really intense flavour. In fact, it might be too intense. Syrupy texture. Long lingering chocolate/vanilla aftertaste. Kind of on the sweet side of things. Hard to drink in a way, but each sip is certainly rewarding. People have said virtually everything about this beer, so Ill leave it at that.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

Very bold flavors of bourbon, alcohol, chocolate, and finishing with notes of oak, prunes, anise, and honey. I like this huge sipper and I think the aging served it well. It could age for many more years and still be a champion.","Richfield, Minnesota, USA","nsquishee"
3451,"2011-12-05",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 17, 2013 Sampled at the Saint Louis Ratebeer Gathering into tulip glass. 2011 vintage. Poured an opaque, very dark brown color with weak tan foam but nice lace and alcohol legs when swirled. Aroma typical of oak-aged Imperial Stout (we drank many that night) but this one has more noticeable bourbon and vanilla than most. Rich malt-sweetness with bread, toast, caramel, and lots of roasted barley. Nuts and toffee, dark chocolate, coffee and cream, plums and sour cherries. Distinct hops bitterness made it all the way through. Heavy body, ""chewy"" mouthfeel. Lasting fruity, roasty aftertaste. The syrupy thickness and dark tannins actually stained the glass. Wow.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

3451,"2011-11-26",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 12, 2013 After around five or six bottles of this at separate occasions, I feel its time to do a re-rating. No question about it, this is a world-class beer and one of the best Ive ever had. It pours black as night with pretty much no head. Aroma is pure magic, with coffee, vanilla, fudge, muscovado, port barrel, chocolate... One of the best smelling beers Ive ever had. Taste is a sweet alcohol sensation, while there are some nuances there, its all about dark sweet fruit, vanilla, milk chocolate and sweet port barrel. Finish is lingering alcohol sweet and warming. Incredibly rich and creamy body with a surprising amount of carbonation to keep it somewhat balanced but the 2012 edition is still sweet, sweet, sweet. A great beer that would have been even better with just a hint of balancing hop bitterness.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Ktwse"

3451,"2011-11-21",4.4,"This was the 2006 version. This beer has been lovingly cellared in my basement. The beer was lightly chilled and served in a wide mouth goblet.

Ar- I remember this beers bourbon aroma being off the scale very ragged and rough. The years in my cellar have been kind. The vanilla oak and bourbon have wrapped themselves around darkly roasted malt. The char of the malt has fallen away over time. Dark cocoa and silky sweet chocolate. Dark fruits have went more to the figgy region. Again I must stress the vanilla oak and bourbon have laced themselves into the beers aroma.The beer looks like spent motor oil. The body is perfectly black with no ruby opaqueness to light. The head looks like burnt caramel and quickly resolves. An oily sheen marks the glass as the beer is quickly consumed. 



Ap-  The beer looks like spent motor oil. The body is perfectly black with no ruby opaqueness to light. The head looks like burnt caramel and quickly resolves. An oily sheen marks the glass as the beer is quickly consumed. 
 
T- Darkly roasted malt bitter sweet cocoa, dark fruits mostly fig all the above infused with very mellow bourbon. A bit of alcohol heat is still present but more warming in nature. A bit of oxidation rounds this beer out. 

P- The body is full and very slick and oily. No alcohol heat at all. The carbonation has fallen off but isnt still. The lower levels of carbonation greatly aide the beers fullness of body.

O- Aging Bourbon County Stout has gotten rid of any rough edges on this beer. A bit of oxidation has crept in but has rounded out the beer for the better. 5 years in the bottle and this beer isnt near exhausted.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AverageMan"

3451,"2011-11-05",4.2,"Serving: 12 oz. bottle from State Line Liquors.  It pours pitch black and even with an aggressive pour, it only musters a slight dark tan head.  The head fades very quickly.  The nose is monstrous with notes of unsweetened chocolate, raisin, oak, bourbon, and a touch of alcohol.  The flavor is definitely on the sweet side with notes of vanilla, oak, chocolate, coffee, unrefined sugar, and slight roasted malt notes.  The alcohol is difinitely present and warming on the way down your throat.  Thick and rich, full bodied isnt the word for this syrupy brew.  Very low carbonation and a linger sweet finish.  I would mind a touch more roast and a hair less sweetness.  Enjoy this one in moderation as it is certainly capable of setting you on your ass.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

The words by themselves dont do this justice.  Poured into a snifter on a cool fall evening the aroma encourages one to take the first sip.  The flavor is a decadent blend of chocolate, roast, bourbon, vanilla, wood and touches of coffee.  Mouth fell is spot on; viscous and smooth; full bodied and delicious.

3451,"2011-09-24",4.7,"2009. Bought at the cool beer place me and Kyle went to during RBSG 2010. Im sharing this with brad but ive came up with at least 10 ways of quickly murdering him so I dont have to split this - all deaths are humorous in nature like choking on toe socks that Im stuffing down his throat using the handle of a plunger while wearing festively coloured clogs and pig ears. The beer is black and is in a glass. The aroma is just silly: eveything is colossal: deep roasted malts with hints of smoke but slightly burnt as perfect, bourbon, sweet tobacco, vanilla, wood shavings that are not new, dark yet not overly bitter chocolate, salt and a bit meaty. Yea, this is amazing. Taste is equal. Massive smooth roast with burnt and an in and out smokiness, hidden fruit, spice and mild burn that is perfect as there is no hint to the 13%, vanilla, nutty, licorice, warm melted chocolate, plum. This is an incredible succulent liquid - the finest of the fine - a beer than more than lives up to legend and reputation.

Reminds me of Makers Mark whiskey. Taste is lightly sweet and medium bitter. Aftertaste is coffee, oak and again, whiskey. It definitely has the same aftertaste of Makers. Medium bodied with a oily yet creamy texture. Has a long bittersweet finish. Overall, this beer is awesome. I cant believe Ive found a beer than reminds me of my favorite whiskey. If only it wasnt  20 bucks for a 4-pack and if only I could find it again.","Rockford, Illinois, USA","jmagnus87"
3451,"2011-08-07",4.8,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2012 2009 Vintage, bottled on 11/12/2009, #1318. Reviewed on 08-08-2011, making it almost two years old. 13% abv. Poured into an over sized wine glass.

A - Perfectly black body. Even holding it up to the light I dont get any brown or red hints, just black. Really dark mocha head that doesnt stick around for very long. The lacing and retention is pretty awesome. A swirl of the glass produces more mocha foam that almost has a red tint. Theres even legs too! Just looks perfect. 5.0/5

S - Bourbon initially. High quality bourbon. Then oak, vanilla, cocoa powder, and lots of roasty malty goodness. The finish is certainly alcoholic. 4.5/5

T - Crazy smooth. I taste bourbon, oak, rich vanilla, and some coffee and chocolate notes. Just a hint of bitter roasted malts. The finish is alcoholic and warming. It does come off a bit strong, but in a good way. Its not even that complex of a beer. Its just extremely well put together, Every flavor flows together perfectly. Nothing really stands out or steals the show. Really fantastic taste. 5.0/5

M - Velvety smooth and super thick. Its coats your tongue and doesnt go away until the last nuance of vanilla and bourbon fades away. Being so creamy and having fairly low carbonation, its a sipper. 4.5/5

O - This is one of my favorite stouts. The bourbon barrel notes really compliment the base beer. Its just so smooth and rich with tons of amazing flavors. If the AB-Inbev buy out means a higher supply of this stuff, then Im game. 4.5/5

2011 Vintage, bottled on, 11/11/2011, #1711. Reviewed on 05-15-2012, making it roughly 6 months old. 14.5% abv. Poured into a brandy snifter. 

A - Pitch black body. Dark mocha one finger high head. Settles down to a thin cap and thick edging. Some light lacing but a swirl leaves behind a ridiculous amount of alcoholic legs and regenerates the head. A thin layer of alcohol just stays on the side of the glass for eternity. Perfect. 5.0/5

S - Heavy bourbon notes. Dark caramelized fruits, molasses, oak, maple, caramel, butterscotch and loads of sweet vanilla. This leads into some bitter cocoa powder and coffee beans. There is a nice alcoholic burn on the finish. 5.0/5

T - Starts off with hot bourbon notes. Roasty and lightly bitter cocoa powder with vanilla and caramel sweetness. Some faint notes of dark fruits, coconut, and maple. The finish is long and bitter. Alcohol is prevalent but well integrated. 4.5/5

M - Quite boozy, so much so that the thick syrupy mouth feel seems to become watery towards the finish. Really coats your mouth though. 4.5/5

O - For a six month old beer this is drinking really damn well. I think I prefer it with a year or two on it though. The flavors seem to meld together a bit more which helps with the intense boozy bourbon notes. The 09 having only 13% abv also helps its cause a bit. 4.5/5","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Pours black with a one finger brown head that leaves short-lived lacing and holds a wispy cap and foamy ring.

Aroma is deep, rich and powerful bourbon, very strong on the bourbon with great underlying notes of premium dark chocolate, anise, black currants, roasted malts, coffee, and some dark fruits such as figs, raisins, plums as well as some sinus-clearing alcohol.  Excellent strength and complexity.  An aroma so strong, I taste it without having to take a sip.  Damn.

Flavor is bourbon, and lots of it, but never overpowers the incredible base beer which features notes of dark chocolate, anise, black currants, plums, raisins, figs, caramel, oak, vanilla, dark roasted malts, coffee.  Hops? heh.  There is some sweetness and alcohol on the finish but minimal considering the 13% ABV.  Dangerously drinkable and crazy complex.

A: Very little carbonation for the newest vintage of the BCBS, with just a little bit of retention on the outer perimeter of the snifter. Jet black per usual.

S: Lots of bourbon in the nose still but also getting some oak and hints of nilla. I can am also detecting the leather that people always talk about. Ive not noticed it in the older vintages though.

T: Bourbon is the first taste but more flavors open as you get past it. Oak is very prominent and there is also an anise flavor in there. The bourbon hits again on the finish and warms as it goes down.

M: Thick with just the right amount of carbonation for the style.

O: Still pretty hot but definitely becoming better. This is my least favorite so far. Still a damn good beer.

09 Vintage. (5/19/11)

A: Beautifully black with a small khaki head retention. Good sticky lacing throughout the snifter I consumed it in.

S: Reeks of bourbon but in the most exceptional way. I dont think there are many better smelling beers out there. The Bourbon takes a back seat as it warms, this is where the oak and vanilla with some subtle hints of chocolate that come into play melting together wonderfully.

T: Very rich and filling with a welcomed warming in the chest from the alcohol. Everything one would expect and hope for from a barrel aged RIS. Flavor really develops from the fridge to room temp. I enjoy both of the flavors offered though, however it does open up quite a bit at room temp and the craftsmanship can truly be appreciated.

O: Overall this beer is phenomenal and one of the best beers Ive ever had the chance to try. I prefer the Bourbon County Stout with age on it though.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","alpar"

Cant imagine how harsh this stuff must be when its fresh. Outstanding palate - thick with hardly any carbonation. Its a good beer, but at 13% its not one that Im going to be drinking regulary.

Aroma is like liquor, I suppose. Really strong. There is some sweetness. Can really smell the alcohol.

Beer is thick and has a great strong liquor presence to it. There is a strong roast character that comes up after the initial sweetness and alcohol of the bourbon. There is decent connectivity between the two flavors. The roast is not an aftertaste but a really late back flavor, there is no aftertaste. Second taste, the carbonation plays on the tongue a little, if there were more it may be better. Overall drinkability is good and so is mouthfeel. I want to try the 2009 for comparison.

Full bodied, feels silky and creamy, tastes of vanilla, caramel, bourbon and malts.

Back then, I thought it was too strong, much like many people. Now that Ive grown more of a liking to strong brews such as imperial stouts and barley wines, I thought Id give it a second try and WHOA! Was I wrong!!! Pours pitch black with a thin, tan head. The aroma from this beer practically kicks you in the mouth! Huge hits of bourbon, burnt oak, cocoa, and vanilla. The flavor is a not-so-subtle alcohol presence from the bourbon barrels with overlays of chocolate, campfire, vanilla, dark chocolate, and bitter hops. Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick as motor oil, with a strong alcohol heat on the finish. Drinks like stout, finishes like a shot of bourbon! This beer is everything it claims to be! Im so glad my tastes have developed, because I love this beer! But, this is NOT a beer for everyone. Its a slow sipper.

3451,"2011-03-03",4.6,"<2008 vintage> bought a 4 pk of 12 oz bottles.
popped it open and poured into a tulip glass

Appearance:
Pours Jet Black, very little head, what head does appear is just a light swirling of dark brown on the edge and through the middle but it dissipates quickly and leaves just a little sticky trelace on the side of the glass.

Smell:
I took a big wiff just after pooring it in the glass, the beer was a bit too cold when i poured it. it smelled boozy like bourbon balls. heavy bitter dark chocolate and bourbon. after it warmed a bit and i had taken a few sips off it I took another big wiff. the bourbon smell was still there but the alcohol/booziness of it dissipated into a more butterscotch smell with hints of raisin and still a nice backdrop of Bitter Dark Chocolate.

Taste:
First sip was extremely boozy and tasted heavy of bourbon and bitter dark chocolate. Heavy hits of pure espresso dark roast bitterness hit all over on the backend of the swallow. as it warmed that same delicious Butterschotch flavor that i smelled started popping out, much more sweetness up front and bringing that bitter dark chocolate espresso to the back with little hints of raisin here and there.

Mouthfeel:
Suprisingly it was thinner then I thought it would be. definately not thick or chewy. more oily and slick. the warmer it got the more sticky sweetness it left on the lips.

Drinkability: Because of how boozy it was I didnt think i would want to drink a lot of this, the flavors are so heavy and rich that i didnt think i would want to drink a lot. As it warmed with that delicious caramel/butterscotch coming through i think i could have drank maybe one more but really, I think 10-16oz of this is where you want it. Definately will drink more of this in the future. might even try the 20.9 oz bottle next time, i would try it on tap but the only place i know that has it, sells it $10 for a 10 oz pour. too spendy for me.","Bloomington, Minnesota, USA","SourNotes"

3451,"2011-02-20",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2011 Bottle. 2009. Pitch black color with a small, diminishing brown foam collar (=Motor-oil). Pretty and slick. Aroma has tons of bourbon - almost pure bourbon and vanilla on the first notes - lots of smooth oak and alcohol characteristics that blends nicely. It is nicely round and the roast is almost overshadowed by the smooth bourbon. The aromatic circumference is constituted mainly by bitter liquorice and dark chili chocolate, some faint dried fruits and smooth coffee as well - all revolving around the whisky/bourbon base. Perhaps a little high on the booze - quite hot. The taste is in the same ball-court, with tons of bourbon and oak, liquorice, vanilla and chocolate. There is a sugary - and boozy - sweetness on the first notes, but it evens out over the next couple of seconds, leaving an aftertaste of alcohol, bitter chocolate, and the more general, roasty bitterness. A very nice beer, but a little too much alcohol for me - it seems to choke the more complex characteristics - even after years in the bottle. Nonetheless, an entirely enjoyable beer; actually quite straightforward - insofar as one enjoys bourbon and whisky. Very heavy duty. I had some really high hopes for this bad boy, and it might just be the age of this particular bottle, or some other unforeseeable circumstances, but to me, it seems one-sided and could use some balancing.","Aarhus, DENMARK","Jaksmart"

4.5 S: Bourbon is strongest, but theres a nice roasted barley component. Coffee and dark chocolate as well.

3451,"2010-12-29",4.1,"Notes from 09/2008. 2007 vintage.

Ineffably black. I can already tell this beer doesnt mess around. Virtually no head. Just a thin, 1/3 cm film on the edge of the glass, like a contact lens on an eye. 

Smell is bourbon, vanilla, then some dark, sweet-smelling malts. Really can smell (burnt) caramel. This smells exceptional. Liquid caramel on the tongue. Wow. The bourbon is devastating. Great balance in the flavor profile. Perhaps the most complex American imperial stout I have had: chocolate, caramel, butterscotch, oak, vanilla, bourbon. Malts abound. Almost cloyingly sweet.

This feels great. Silky body that demands sipping. Thick and chewy. Probably, as the bottle suggests, would go well with a cigar. Not much on cigars myself, but I can only imagine. Low carbonation which translates into a sticky residual feeling in the mouth. Very nice.

Im not sure what to say about drinkability. Yes, pick this one up if you can. But I cant imagine having more than one of these in a night. I can barely sip it given its heaviness, boldness, and complexity. This is the bourbon stout to try.

3451,"2010-12-14",4.4,"12 oz bottle, 2010 vintage. Pours out a thick black with a very thin brown head. Aroma is staggering: hazlenut, cream, coffee, oat, and smokey cheese smells all coated by an almost overpoweringly strong bourbon whiskey nose.

Taste is almost too complex for words. The bourbon presence is strong, but does not hide the other flavors this stout brings. Its almost a feast for your mouth: coffee, chocolates, roasted nuts, and smokey bacon all seem to be present in this beer. Its truly amazing. 

The alcohol provides plenty of heat, almost too much.
It took me an hour and a half to get through this beer and I enjoyed every minute of it. As the beer warms up, more flavors begin to show their colors and the beer becomes more enjoyable. I would serve this at 55F and let it warm up. Fantastic beer.","Alabama, USA","theaudist"

Ive had the 2008 batch aged close to a year and a half, the 2009 batch aged  a year, and the 2010 batch fresh.  This is an intense sipper, best with some age but perfectly enjoyable fresh.  Fresh, it is a little hot.  With some age,  the alcohol is present on the nose, but not as much as youd think for a beer so strong. The bourbon and vanilla notes are off the charts, backed up by a ton of bittersweet chocolate and black coffee aroma. Its opaque, dark as night, pours with an incredibly rich but small head.  Its so thick that it pours and behaves as if its flat, but it has a surprising liveliness on the tongue.  Its sweet, rich, savory, without crossing over too much into soy territory.

3451,"2010-11-04",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2010 Bottle.

A - Pitch black color, no light getting through. Small, frothy, creamy, dark cafe colored head. Average retention leaving a ring of lace with some patchy lacing.

S - Wonderful aroma. Bourbon is strong and definitely present, but the more I smell, the more undertones I pick up. Strong roasted malt and barley. The more I smell, the more nice chocolate and fudge along with plenty of vanilla and some oak. Burnt caramel and molasses come out as well. Faint coffee and anise. After smelling this multiple times I keep liking it more and more so I ended up bumping up the score as it is boarderline perfect score.

T - Definitely a strong bourbon flavor (probably doesnt hurt that this was bottled 20 days ago) gives this beer a kick. Some roasted barley, but nothing overly bitter or really roasted. Strong dark chocolate with a good amount of fudge like flavor. Definitely has an oaky and vanilla flavor, but no real smokiness. Slight burnt molasses and caramel provides a slight sweetness. Alcohol is definitely present, but that is to be expected given the freshness. It isnt overly strong though.

M - Full body with average carbonation. Full, creamy feel with a slightly slick finish.

D - Definition of a sipper. That said, given the ABV and strong bourbon aspect, I would love to drink this again later (not right away obviously). Great mouthfeel and tasty and complex taste makes me crave more. Alcohol is strong (see sipper).

Notes: Vintage 2010 bottled on 10/15/10. Wonderful beer. Strong bourbon aspect. Glad I have four more to age and will add on to the review when I try this later. Quite an amazing beer. Bourbon and alcohol are strong but there are so many other flavors as well. Great beer and I am really excited to age this and try it later.

It is currently my favorite imperial stout, and as such Im now introducing a new habit: re-rating my previous favorite down a notch to represent my current favorite. Gotta show whos on top. Anyway, Goose Island Bourbon County Stout pours a pitch black body with no head worth mentioning, but the aroma omitted by this baby virtually engulfs half the room when the cork is popped. Enormous complexity, to the extent that aroma and taste kinda wander into each other as I sip my way carefully through the smooth, silky, rich palate. What do I have here? What do I NOT have here?? Vanilla, booze, maple syrup, oak, bourbon, coconut (deliciously integrated in the flavor), dark chocolate, toffee and hints of molasses, peanuts and burnt toast. Extremely rich and complex; the strong coconut/chocolate profile being really original. Well, at least I havent tasted it before and it just WORKS in this beer.

The flavor is more of the same, with rich dark chocolate filling the mouth at first, and the bourbon taking over in the finish.

3451,"2010-09-05",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2015 BCBS is an incredible beer.  Its relatively easily available and puts many hyped beers to shame.  While its not quite the best barrel-aged stout in the country, it defines the sub-style for me (and, I assume, many others) and has held up very well against a horde of fancified newcomers.  The beer is jet black with a healthy brown head, when fresh.  The head is much smaller with older vintages.  The aroma is big and rich with flavor.  Theres a ton of bourbon, but it doesnt drown out the dark malt and other barrel notes.  Coffee, chocolate, roast, vanilla and oak aromas blend almost perfectly with the bourbon.  The taste is strong and assertive but also smooth and luxurious, just as a big stout should be.  Theres a good deal of booze, but its a warming, pleasant presence and the beer is better for it.  Mouthfeel is smooth and full.  Not to take anything away from the base stout, but Goose Island is simply better at barrel-aging than the vast majority of breweries.  I dont know if this is experience paying off or if Greg Hall is just a genius brewer who nailed it on his first try, but Goose Island BCS is a modern classic of American beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Jet black with a blood-brown edging which pokes through a quickly diminishing walnut head.  Then theres the aroma.  Its there the second the cap lifts from the bottle and from the first its overwhelming.  The bourbon and oak are undeniable, as are the notes of vanilla and port.  Then come hefty butterscotch and liquorice chords which are raised on the backs of the bitterest coffee and the oldest, woodiest hops.  The 13% ABV only serves to impress the whiskey connection and makes this the most spirit like beer Ive had.  But the booze isnt the only thing to take ones breath away.  The flavours are endlessly deep.  The vanilla comes on strong but peels back to reveal chocolate and ash, tobacco and leather; but there are subtleties to be found.  Aniseed and lemon grass are noted at the back of the palate, as are cherries and raisins.  There is too a certain soy sauce flavour reminiscent of the bolder Mikkeller beers.  This cuts an edge into the caramel, coffee and bourbon.  Mouth feel is very thick, velvety, but also strangely chalky - possibly due to the high ABV.  The finish is everything of the nose and taste slowly developing and finding a final unity right at the very end.  A stunning beer.

Intense is her name, and I am basking in the warm glow of bourbon, thick caramel, vanillin, wood tannins, melted bakers and milk chocolate, vanilla root, and burnt cream. Sweet dreams are made of these Now, how about that seductive body to be found within? Full, intense, and rich. Eyes closed, I savor each microscopic iota of flavor as it caresses every open surface of my mouth and throat. The top of my tongue shivers under her boozy ministrations while licorice, bourbon, spice and tannins, prunes and dates dipped in melted chocolate, burnt caramel, and a flourish of wood in the finish seduce. A fireplace sipper if there ever were one; I feel the urge to double my pleasure as I soak in the warm glow of crackling embers with a glass of Bourbon County Stout and a snifter of bourbon, my choice.

First sip was a big wow. This one is definitely thick. Taste is a deep bourbon with roasted malts. The fruit also comes out and near the end there is a vanilla flavor.

Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. After it lingers around a while, the 13% comes out and is very overwhelming. Full bodied beer.

Wow.  Taste is in your face bourbon, malty as hell with some sweetness although its subdued and perfect.  Awesome mouthfeel, about as full as it gets.  Flavors range from bourbon whiskey to figs to vanilla.  All over the place.  Alcohol is extremely well hidden, zero heat in the finish.  This is one for the cellar.  Dont drink em fresh.

Harsh bourbon burn near the end of each sip is likely to ease with time -- looking forward to sampling another 2009 after another 6-12 months.

The malt aroma is rich and dark, and hints at but comes nowhere near to foreshadowing the complexity of the taste.  And what taste:  sweet, thick and creamy liquor carries boldly intermingled flavors of prune, chocolate, coffee, raisin and caramel.  As the stout warms hints of yeast and bread are clearly evident.

It poured black with a very small tannish head that lasted for maybe a minute or so.  The smell was dominated by bourbon and chocolate, but other subtle odors came through.  The first smell gave me the ""whiskey shudders.""  The taste was very complex, which I expected, and tasted like a milkshake for grown-ups in ways.  There was a heavy flavor of both chocolate and bourbon, with charred oak and most of the other flavors others have described.  You can tell there is alcohol in here, but its not nearly as powerful as I would expect.  There is a little burn after a few sips, mostly on the tip of the tongue and the back of the mouth. It went down much smoother than I thought it would.   I wish this beer had been around when I was in college and that I would have had the funds for it.  It would be a great warm up on a night you feel the urge for a few drinks of whiskey.  I will be picking some up soon to age.

A-Body is a viscous motor oil black that pours with an approximately 1/2 finger foamy cocoa brown head. Head subsides slowly to a thin collar and no lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- Nose is robust and complex. The sweetness and astringency of bourbon comes through first with a big, thick, robust chocolate malt backbone.

T- The taste is very similar to the smell. The bourbon character balances with the roasted chocolate malt and hints of toffee also come through. The flavor is sweeter than most stouts I have had but it adds a nice touch. The flavors remain balanced but intensify for the finish. An alcohol warmth lingers also.

P- Nice, thick, vicious, warm mouthfeel with low to medium carbonation.

The lace is mostly absent, excepting a few clusters of small spots that slide into into the stout.  Density is high!  The alcohol is evident and warming.  I imagine it would be excellent in a snifter. Drink with care and devotion.  The subsequent nose reminds me of Gethsemane Chocolate Bourbon Fudge.

Theres a pleasantly smooth and sticky bourbon aftertaste.

Big bourbon nose, with vanilla, charred oak, molasses, chocolate, raisins, tobacco, and figs.  The bourbon and molasses take over in the flavor, but the other notes from the aroma are all there, with the figs also coming out a bit more.  The bourbon really pops in this, and would probably settle down if allowed to sit longer.  It also makes for some nice warming alcohol and a mouth-coating richness, a great, not dominating bourbon and molasses moutfheel.  Full-bodied, with minimal carbonation.

The sweet aftertaste almost gets to be a bit too much (at least for me), but this is a pretty accomplished beer and definitely worth a try.

3451,"2010-01-21",4.3,"Bottle - Great beer for those bourbon lovers looking to experience a blend of malts and bourbon. 
  Nose is a heavy mixture of smoke, vanilla, and caramel with an oaky alcohol in the background.  Well rounded but warns of an exceptionally dangerous taste to follow.
  Appearance points cannot be docked by any reasonable taster.  Completely opaque brew pours a thick, frothy head that is closer to amber in color than just off white.  Head falls ever so slowly and leaves wonderful lacing.
  Taste makes you stand up to shake its hand.  Heavy flavors roll around your mouth that are both bitter and sweet.  The bourbon here really helps control the stout and keeps the complex flavors in balance.
  A full bodied beer both thick and creamy.  The soft and often times nearly flat carbonation does well to take a back seat in this pungent brew.  The finish offers a long bitter, if not slightly astringent, fade that lets you know this beer is best sipped to be enjoyed.
  A well rounded brew that should be shared with two or three friends if you go out and pick up a bomber... a little goes along way with this 13% bourbon stout.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","Overml01"

3451,"2010-01-18",4.3,"12 oz 2006 bottle received from Orbialr0x. The first smell let me know that this beer was going to be very good. The smell was chocolate and heavy. The color was black with a brown head. The taste was like Godiva dark chocolates with hints of bourbon coming through as it warmed. This was so amazing. Definitely the best bourbon barrel stout Ive ever had if not the best stout in general. Alcohol was very well hidden.

Update 01/21/08 2006 bottle

Heavy bourbon smell, almost like sniffing a straight shot. Bourbon is also present in the flavor but there is also a nuttiness that kinda reminds me of peanut butter. There alcohol is well hidden, not a hint of the 11% in the taste and just a whiff in the nose.

The vanilla flavor finishes the beer very well. If it wasnât for this beer being $10.99 a 4-pack, this would be a beer I would drink a few times a week.

Thick, black, and oily liquid. Disappointingly though, there is no head to speak of, even with a hard pour. No real lacing, either. I swirled it to check its legs though. Hell, its wearing a skirt! Most impressive.

Smell is over-the-top boozey. Bourbon notes are ever-so present. Smokey oak and hints of sweet vanilla. Hints of chocolate. Big overripe dark fruits.

This reminds me of fresh S.A. Triple Bock. Wow. Bourbon warmth comes through prominently. Syrupy dark fruit flavors. Chocolate notes mingle with big vanilla flavor. Big malty backbone. Smokey oak flavor. Caramelized brown sugar. F***ing complex flavor pallette!
For all of the bourbon-like warmth that is here, combined with the 13% ABV, I find the alcohol to be remarkably well hidden.

Mouthfeel is phenomenal! For as big as this beer is, this is one smooth easy drinking bastard. Big, thick, chewey and oily, yet smooth and light on the tongue, at the same time. Amazing.

I would like to drink these, one after the other, over an evening. When the alcohol eventually knocks me out, Id like to wake up and continue on doing the same thing...for like a week. Damn, its good.

This one is as black as they come and is really viscous. Ive had this before and I know its hard to get head development going. So I tried a rather aggressive pour into my snifter, but all I got was a minimal layer of dark beige foam that dissipates immediately into a minimal ring of lacings.

The smell is amazing. Massive bourbon aromas sit side by side with a wonderful smooth stout base. Vanilla, almonds, oak, licorice and a hint of soy sauce. Some hints of brown sugar and molasses. The roasted malts really need to struggle to keep up with the bourbon, but I think they manage quite well. The bourbon gets a little boozy and I pick up plenty of alcohol fumes.

The taste follows suit and surly doesnt disappoint, even though expectations get cranked up by the appearance and smell. The bourbon flavors are really powerful, rich and full, but nonetheless the beer manages to stay balanced. Lots of vanilla and oak with notes of almonds. Hints of sweet licorice. Perhaps a suggestion of soy sauce. The roasted malty character is noticeable but it gets a little hard to detect with all the bourbon notes going on. Nevertheless, the malts manage to create a good balancing point for the powerful bourbon flavors. All in all, the beer has a pleasant balance between sweetness and a salty note. The usual flavors of dark fruits and chocolate are really hard to pick up in this one, but I do think here is a delightful note of truffles. The finish is loaded with boozy and hot alcohol that fits nicely with the sweetness from the bourbon and malts, but it gets a little too much here and there. Wood, notes of salt licorice, a light herbal bitterness and long-lasting bourbon notes round everything up.

Very very viscous and smooth - this one is thick like cream. Medium, well suited carbonation. Although both smell and taste is great in this one, the mouthfeel is really the highlight here, its just that great. It just delivers a sophisticated expression to an otherwise bold and cocky beer.

This is a good imperial stout, to say the least. Very powerful with a massive bourbon character. Its quite impressive that it still manages to come of as balanced. However, its not perfect. Although this is obviously a sipper, the alcohol gets to demanding and overpowering every now and then. And due to the onslaught of the bourbon flavors, the beer looses some complexity.

NOTE: This bottle was about 11 months old. Ive sampled a bottle from the same batch when it was reasonably fresh, and although I think it holds up really well with plenty of bourbon still hanging around, I think the bourbon notes have faded just a little bit.

Flavor is huge, lots of sweetness and plenty of bitterness, there is also a alcohol flavor. Full body with mild carbonation and a creamy thick mouth feel. This is a great beer, a bit boozy but still a really nice sipper.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","savnac"

Orig. rating. 2008 bottle.

Pours pretty dark brown, close to zero head. Smells a little oxidized. A ton of bourbon and chocolate in there. Take a deep breath for that cleansing rush of alcohol through the nasal passages. Very rich flavor - stands up to the richest Expedition Stouts. A lot of bourbon, very sweet, and again that distinctive bourbon oak flavor. Extremely smooth and creamy. Low roast levels compared to some other RIS examples. Its really rather amazing that this is a 13% beer because it really comes off far from boozy. Very tasty and a good example of how to make an extreme imperial stout without going overboard.

3451,"2009-10-08",1.4,"Thick, oily, headless pour of a seal brown beer. Intense dark chocolate and vanilla extract aroma with secondary notes of bourbon, roasted coffee, and salt liquorice and a strong undercurrent of baked raisins. Balance is firmly to the powerful sweetness, though followed by significant roast- and hop-derived bitterness with a constant round acidity and moderate saltiness. Powerful flavors mimic the aroma but are viciously overpowered by a hot alcohol and salted, smoked fish combination. Thick body, oily texture, faint carbonation.

Oil pour to a snifter, with a dark, black/brown hue,  minimal foam, and a few spots of lacing. The aroma was notes of dark fruit, chocolate, wood, smoke, and caramel, but were mostly overwhelmed by the potent bourbon. The flavor exhibited the bourbons very warming qualities in addition to the blend of aroma notes. A syrupy, full bodied, kick-ass elixir!
Just recently shared a 2009 bomber with beer friends at Lunar Brewing Co., viscously poured to snifters additionally showing some garnet highlighting, leggy coating on the glass, a full nose of barrel notes, dark cherry sweetness, and mellow but strong, bourbony alcohol.

Theres a lot offered up here but comes across a little mangled up. The flavor is intensely dark roasted with grain astringency, strong alcohol, and a ton of boozey Bourbon--certainly a sipper, perhaps best enjoyed alongside some chocolate cake, toffee, or other foil to play off of these intense flavors.  The body is out of balance with high alcohol which magnifies the bitterness making the overall experience a bit harsh. Overall, a very good beer for very particular circumstances.

Flavor is just a perfect balance of the bourbon being strong enough without killing the other flavors. Chocolate, molasses, dark cocoa, a bit of nuttiness, dark fruits are abundant, along with the raisins and coconut. The flavor continues to develop for two minutes after swallowing.

Yes, there are raisins here too.  The booze is actually very well-disguised, until the smooth burn on the way down, and even then, it is not astringent in the least.  Creamy, succulent mouthfeel, bordering on the perfect beer.  Creamy, dark, smokey and sweet.  If this beer was a woman, Id do dishes, laundry, and toilets with pleasure just to taste of her charms.

My favorite style is imperial stout. This one poured viscous black. It was quite difficult to produce some head, but when I did there was a nice chocolate head on this beer. Perfect dark black looking beer. 2008 bottle, so it has had time to mellow. Very pungent malt sweet aroma. Almost a bit too much on the sweet malt aroma. I was hoping for a more pungent bourbon aroma. There was bourbon in the aroma, but it wasnt what I expected it to be i.e. it was more muted due to the extremely sweet smelling malts. Not too nuanced in terms of aroma because of the sweet malty aroma. Again, bourbon flavor, with a heavy sweet malt flavor as well. As I have said, the malts for me are too sweet. Subtle chocolate aroma, with some bourbon. A decent bourbon flavor, but I was hoping for more. Very thick beer, almost too much. I could just be being picky because I am tired. Slight alcohol burn. Not a horrible beer, but the overly malty sweet flavor just kills it.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

Its body appears still. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and reduces this 13% alcohol beast to a shockingly quaffable delight with just a hint of its ruggedness on the back end. Nose is vanilla bean, a little bit of raw shredded baking coconut, heavy toast oak, booze, dates, port, baked cinnamon apple crumble, and some heath toffee bar. The taste reminds me of a late harvest Zinfandel I once had with some dark chocolate truffles.

Jet black, no head even when poured from a height. Big sweet vanilla aroma - clearly bourbon barrel aged. Soft sweet smooth sticky palate, but with a gentle tingle of carbonation. Vanilla sweet taste is now joined with a really rich roast - burnt, which in context comes over as a lovely dark chocolate. The alcohol is relatively constrained, but definitely there. Finish is again more of the vanilla and sweet roast, with a slightly ashy and stuffy feel to the burntness. Perhaps the best beer Ive had from the US, even topping 10/50.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

A few times it has come with a tan head, but most of the time it reaches the table with no head at all. Aroma is all chocolate, which predicts the taste. At times, this seems more like a chocolate liquer than a stout as far as taste goes, but the mouthfeel is really what makes it. It is thick (not syrup thick, but damn thick), yet smooth. It also gives you a nice big alcohol blast in the finale.

Honestly I like my heavy beers to burn and churn the flavors into the palate and I felt that this one had so much to offer in terms of flavor complexity but not the harshness to fully bloom all of them. Probably the maltiest beer ever, copious amounts of sugared split wheat and heavy chocolate/espresso on the after swallow. Thick thick thick, a true motor oil beer if ever there was one. Great beer, deserved of its world-rating because of what it is and how well it does everything BIGgly, but I would never be able to drink more than one of these pups.

Taste is cocoa and malt and booze.  Nose burn from the alcohol.  Bitter afters.  Getting too much alcohol overpowering a lot of it.  Sweet dark fruit comes through in the beginning.  Super gooey sticky loogy making in the back of my throat.  Have to decide later how good I think it is.

Instantly coats my mouth and kind of insulates it for the next sip.  Oily, slick, more toasted wood, burnt sugar, edible motor oil, and love.  I have to swallow twice.

3451,"2009-07-09",4.5,"Original review date 10/29/2008. 2007 vintage into a Cab glass...

Deep, dark, espresso/motor oil/tar...needless to say, quite viscous with wisps of pumpernickel head up top - very small wisps.

Creamy vanilla with a lot of oaky feel to it - bourbon sweetness with hearty chocolate tones...a nice smokiness as in ultra-seared steak char. Heavy, boozy caramel...more bittersweet chocolate - almost too much to mention here. With further warmth, grassy hops emerge. Its got it all, baby...$#!+ dog!

Whooo hooo...complexity abounds. Bourbon, vanilla, oak, coffee...ultra-dry bitter coffee/chocolate mega-roasted malt...austere grassy hops complement the bittersweet malt quite nicely and after a while balance out the bourbon booziness. This cools off nicely with a fair amount of warm alcohol remaining.

All over the place - this has bittersweet grassy hops in Beautiful Chemistry with chocolate/coffee huge malt and mellowing bourbon. Port-like tones on deep background.

Definitely something to seek and savor. More motivation to visit family in the Chicagoland area more often and to bring some back for the cellar. This could even out with a little more time but even now it drinks down much more quickly than anticipated. A classic.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

Dark dark brown, oily looking with no head at all. I even try to pour it from some height, but no - no head.
Nose is bitter dark chocolate, liqourice, smoke, tar, liwour-like-heat.
Fat, oily, and sweet mouthfeel.
Maybe a bit to sweeet, but it is oh, so good, so it is OK.
It is actually somewhat bourbon-like. If i concentrate, I can sense the vanilla aromas described on the label.

3451,"2009-05-09",3.9,"2008 vintage on draft at Blind Tiger Ale House. This one was run through a randle with some mint in there to celebrate the Kentucky Derby. This one poured a near pitch black color with a small a tan head that fades to a thin film around the glass. The aroma shows some dark bittersweet chocolate, burnt malts, roast, and a huge presence of kentucky bourbon. The flavor follows with the bitter chocolate, roast, and burnt caramel up front followed by the bourbon. Some oaky vanilla and a hint of mint comes through, but everything is dominated by the bourbon flavors. A touch of smoke rounds things out. Medium-full bodied and very thick on the mouthfeel. The carbonation is low and helps this one go down fairly smooth with a huge bourbon finish. The mint leaves a nice clean feel behind also. The alcohol wams things up all the way down. Well crafted stout, but this is just all bourbon and a little too much for my taste.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

The aroma is pretty much straight bourbon, with a light dark chocolate accompaniment.   Thick and slick with low, fine carbonation.   Lots of bourbon, wood, alcohol, and dark chocolate flavors.   The alcohol is relatively smooth, but very present.   I can dig this a little bit, but it seems to be intense just for intensitys sake.   The bourbon runs the show for sure.

Thick as a cake too, with low carbonation.   Almost chewable.   This release has smoothed out a bit with just over a year of age in the bottle at this point.   Much better than I remember, with rich chocolate and bourbon, but much less burn.   Still sweet as hell with plenty of alcohol, but more rounded at this point.   Still like a bourbon chocolate dessert that you dont want to drink much more than half a small bottle of, but I can really see the appeal of this one now.

No head initially.  I watched as a thin, shallow, mocha colored head rose from the depths of this dense elixir.  Nose is enticing....heavy on the bourbon, I could smell from a foot away as I let it breath.  Very sweet, roasted malt, semi-sweet morsels, vanilla, burnt espresso roast and fleeting moments of alcohol.  Flavor is syrupy sweet, damn near cloying, but Ill overlook it.  Strong, sweet bourbon mash flavor is heavy on the frontal assault, followed by brownie mix swirled with Hersheys syrup, roasted dark malts, vanilla and burnt wood.  I would like to see more IBUs.  There is some hop astringency on the finish but I would like to see it a little bit higher to combat the sweetness and/ or lower the malt content.  Body is thick and enveloping.  The brewers description is pretty much dead on.   This is a serious mix of bourbon and Devils Food cake.  There is no doubt this a damn fine brew.

Initial aroma is bourbon, vanilla,  dark chocolate, black mission figs.  Flavor has an additional molasses and black licorice layer that is pretty sweet.  My lips are sticky, some nice throat warming booze.  This beer just warms the soul.  What makes this beer so great is the fig, tabacco, and mollasses that shines through the bourbon presence.

3451,"2009-03-27",4.1,"33 cl bottle, Fargo, ND, USA, 2008 batch. Jet black, almost solid appearance. Very sweet cocoa aroma, plumb and bourbon (surprise). Thick. Warm and lingering, very smooth initially with a creeping booziness. Very much bourbon infused with everything that comes with it. Quite nice, although the complexity that some other imperial stouts have is taken over by the bourbon. Still very nice.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","markas101"
3451,"2009-03-27",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2009 2008 bottle.  Nose hits you right out of the bottle with sweet and charred notes.  The pour is coal black with a fairly small, light brown-dark caramel color, fizzy-frothy head which is mostly diminishing and leaves minimal lace.  Finally the nose... certianly potent but not quite complex enough yet; lots of charred oak, vanilla, light bourbon notes, blackstrap molasses, light candied currants, hints at anise and chocolate chip cookies.  Flavor is amazing; sweet, rich, dessert-like,  and robust, still a bit young.  Notes of black strap molasses, lots of candied currants, burnt caramel, sweet vanilla bean, and chocolate chip cookies start the flavor progression but they are immediately followed by lots charred/scorched oak, light anise, a hefty amount of bourbon warmth, light notes of dark roast coffee, and some floral hops moving into the finish.  Palate is too carbonated being lively but the full body and the velvety, chewy, nearly oily texture made up for it a bit; more than moderate warmth.  Finishes only average length with sweet notes diminishing leaving bourbon, some roast, and light floral hop notes.  Lots of mixed emotions in this one; a perfect flavor with so many nice, complementing things going on.  However, the forced carbonation hurt the head and the palate, which could have great, the finish died out a bit too quickly, the warmth was nice for a bourbon imperial stout but was a bit too young, and the nose could have been great with a bit more time in the cellar.  So, I guess for now I am just going to applaud the flavor in all its complexity and desert-like richness and cellar some bottles; well see what happens in some time.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

I gladly spent a lot of time on the aroma; oak, pine, bourbon, sherry, even some dark fruit behind all of that, wonderful scent. Lots of oak, vanilla, bourbon and rum flavors, a little roasty, but not a lot of that as the oak and bourbon shine, with some piney hops and hint of dark chocolate.

Pours a jet black with a large tan head that lasts. Smells of lots of bourbon (extremely bourbon), and some vanilla (nothing compared to the bourbon). Tastes of straight bourbon, not even like a beer, more like drinking bourbon. It was interesting, as I knew it was a beer, but it was so extreme that I had to think that to drink it all. Surprisingly smooth though. A beer to have, definitely","Highland Park, Illinois, USA","soccer290"
3451,"2009-03-23",4.6,"Appearance...Its a goddam Imperial stout. Clarity? who gives a shit? Black?...check. Long-lasting tan head?...check. 

Aroma...Clean bourbon oak. Lots of vanilla, but nothing is really over-the-top...and I mean that in a positive light. Ever so light presence of the soy-like autolysis, but actually not offensive. There is some dark fruit, but its in the background. The chocolate is nice and there is no roast to speak of.

Flavor...This is all about balance. There is really nothing out of place at all. just oh-so-smooth chocolate, vanilla and bourbon in nice tight package.

Palate...Does a beer of this strength get much smoother. Rich creamy body, but never cloying. Just beautiful.

O.I. ..... Quite simply, the finest execution of a 12%+ beer that I have had. Just so smooth and drinkable. Everything in balance, and nothing making my jaw hurt or making me hold back from taking a good haul. If I cant take a good haul...theres something wrong.

Pours a obsidian black color with a medium brown head that dissipates a slowly. Not much lacing.

FULL body beer with a syrupy texture. Light fizzy carbonation. 
DRINKABILITY: 
This is a sipping beer. I split a 12 ounce beer with a friend and that was plenty. I would probably give this beer a C based on drinkability but you have to give it an A for complexity and uniqueness.

Lots of roasted malts, dark chocolate, fudge, toffee, almonds, oak, vanilla, bourbon and even some light smokiness behind all this too. Flavour is powerful; very sweet, yet balanced, in my opinion. Roasted malt, dark chocolate, fudge, almonds, oak, vanilla and bourbon. Perfection. A slight warming note from the alcohol. Palate is extremely filling.

3451,"2009-01-18",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2009 Pours a solid brownish black with little apparent carbonation. The head is a nice medium brown and quite thin; So far this has all the characteristics of a great imperial stout. Wow, this stuff is HUGE! Flavor is extremely complex. Reminicent of Dogfish Head Palo Santo in that the body has a strong sweet bourbon essence, but in more of an impy style ultimately. Actually, if my palate were already dirty and Id had a few drinks already, someone could pass this off on me as Dogfish Head Palo Santo itself. The sweetness also has a real pineapple essence when I stop and explore it on the tongue for a minute. All of these characteristics I mention are in addition to your usual impy flavors and complexity; the coffee, chocolate, anise, licorice, et cetera are all present as well. Overall this is one of the best beers Ive ever had, yet I dont find myself in a euphoric state. Im enjoying myself, just not in a fun kind of way. Theres something about this brew thats keeping me from rating it a perfect 5: Something intangible about it that if were not there would make this an absolute favorite of mine. Overall, world-class-excellence. Though I just didnt enjoy it as much as my rating would indicate. -------- This is definitely getting better with time: As of 10/15/09 its a lot smoother than than it was a year ago, making it more drinkable despite no compromise in complexity. The vanilla and pineapple flavors have calmed down as well as has the whisky. Getting very close on my impy list to Dark Horizon 2nd, Dark Lord 09, and The Abyss; the only difference being that I dont find myself wanting more than one glass at a time of this, wheras I could make a mini-session out of the other three.","California, USA","Gypsy19"

Pours a rather reasonable dark brown with a creamy tan colored head, diminishing rapidly to a ring.  The nose is sweet, rather sweet.  Oaky vanilla comes together with some very strong chocolate smells.  Alcohol balances the sweetness.  Dusty bourbon.  A hint of spice and anise.  Lower carbonation, with a slippery thought not ridicilously thick mouth.  Sweet chocolate, coconut, cream, vanilla and oak.  Its just an assault.  Very sweet, but very light in some ways.  Not thick and heavy like oaked Dark Lord, but similar flavors. Alcoholic chocolate syrup with a creamy alcoholic finish.  Very little roast, perhaps almost none other than a slight acidity.

The nose is fully of woody, oaky sweet notes and caramel and candied sugar.  The roasty burnt coffee is is harder pick up, but lurks in the background.  There is a woody acidic alcohol burn that hits the pallate first that almost has a hint of sourness.  That is quickly overwhelmed by the velvety smooth, almost sticky body.  The alcohol soak is heavy and deep on the back of the tongue.  The flavor bursts with notes of burbon, oak, coffee and chcolate malts.

3451,"2009-01-05",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2017 Pours pitch black, with absolutely zero head. From a 12-inch center pour, there was a thin patch of bubbles that dissipated immediately. Leaves an incredibly thin ring of bubbles around the edges of the top. Aroma is bourbon, chocolate, molasses and a slightly funky note... the flavor? Wow. Ive *never* tasted anything that so magnificently soaked up the flavor of the barrels in which it was aged. It tastes like bourbon. Honest to God. Chocolate, but seriously? Mostly bourbon. Just amazing - like I poured a shot of Knob Creek into a glass of Old Viscosity, and let it sit for a year. What a distinctive flavor. Palate is wonderful, flavor is fantastic. Couldnt have expected more.

Its small, perfectly shaded head could only be improved by being a *little* larger.  But Im still scoring its appearance a 5.  Now, back to its aroma.  This sucker is potent.  It makes the whole room glisten in aromatic nirvana the moment you pop the cap.  Its smell... like you opened a bottle of bourbon.

The palate is exceedingly smooth, full, and creamy with little carbonation. The flavor really makes sense following the aromas, which I cant say for very many beers. It complements the aromas. There is a stronger presence of coffee than I had imagined, but also wood, caramel, chocolate, and of course the motif of bourbon. The alcohol is a little more noticeable in the flavor than in the nose, but still belies the 13 percent a.b.v. unlike in most barley wine style beers. I definitely get nice smooth notes of bourbon that really enhance the beer. I feel like there could be slightly more carbonation and more head, but the palate is excellent on this beer.

Very dark rust colored cream head on the pour that disappears, but a small, dime sized ring of foam remained from the carbonation rising in the center (pretty sweet), highly opaque though not as motor oil-like as others with a deep dark brown-black-burgundy color.  Again, very strong flavor, not overly thick (for the style), not perfectly smooth either, and there is a long lingering tingle on the tongue and palate; bourbon is a pretty major player here in the flavor, backed up by a rich mocha, subtle vanilla, tart cherry pie filling, and minor whisky alcohol.

Smells of bourbon first then of sweet chocolate and molasses with a large follow up punch of bourbon. Brown sugar, vanilla and roasted oak. Faint hints of vanilla and cocoa. the smell seems to get sweeter as the beer warms and is drunken. This beer oozes sweet chocolate, molasses, bourbon. There are still hints of a light vanilla. It has an overwhelming bourbon and bitter sweet chocolate taste. Lightly carbonated and leaves a tingly molasses/bourbon aftertaste. The chocolate flavors become increasingly bitter as the beer warms. A little too much of a bitter after taste as the beer reaches room temperature. This beer feels the way it tastes. A little boozy, lightly carbonated and way way way to easy to drink. Very smooth for such a power house. Bubbles a little in the back of your throat as I drink the first glass. At 13% I should be able to down these as easy is it goes down. This beer is the best of Bourbon meets a stout champion.

I wasnt exactly aware of how strong this beer was until I got a whiff of it, Nose is this big robust and rich aroma of whiskey and alcohol including black roast malt and pure sugar. This stout is as black as can be and resembles used motor oil while for one quick moment there is a sizzling sound and small head that then vanishes instantly. My brief description on flavor is simple and to the point: strong presence of alcohol along with whiskey, wood, rye, dark chocolate, sugar cane and black licorice. Such a potent and powerful stout Im so glad they sent some to the west coast.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

3451,"2008-11-27",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 3, 2009 Goose Island Brewing - Bourbon County Brand Stout, Vintage 2008. 12 oz bottle poured into my New Belgium glass. 13% abv.

Appearance: Jet Brown with zero head or visible bubbles.

Aroma: Easy going, non harsh bourbon, vanilla, oak. The warmth of the alcohol travels up my nose and tickles my throught, as if I was sniffing a bottle of hard alcohol. After sniffing it more and more, I can smell tobacco and grahm cracker crust.

Taste: Vanilla, caramel, butterscotch, bitter chocolate covered dark fruits (dates, raisins, figs). A very small small hint of hop spice, a touch of oak and coffee in the finish.

Mouthfeel: Sticky, silky, gooey, syrupy.

Overall: I was really afraid this wouldnt meet the hype. It blew me away with how complex and layered this guy is.  I dont see the need to age one of these, but would not oppose doing it and trying it.  I hate to say this, but very worth the $5 + a bottle.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

Chocolate aroma buried in bourbon and alcohol.   Chocolate and dark fruit overrun with bourbon and alcohol. Mildly bitter lingering finish with alcohol burn.  Full body, no carbo.  Might have been good if it had some carbo to let the alcohol and bourbon effervesce.  Ill try it again, but I gotta call em as I drink em, especially at $6.49 for a twelve ounce domestic.   Unpleasant and irritating.   Not sure why they would put a beer like this into a twist-top bottle.

The fluffy head has 3 finger height, and the lacing clings like glue.  The aromas are mind boggling, as you know exactly what is about to happen.  The intial explosion of bourbon and oak is a little unbalanced, however, 1/10 of a second later it melds perfectly into the complex beer.  The alcohol lends a helping hand, and dances down the throat.  However, 60 IBU’s doesn’t do it justice.","Crestwood, Illinois, USA","JLAudio"

Big roast malt, mocha, caramel, boozy aroma. Smoother up front than some Imperials, flowing nicely throughout. Great array of flavors. Caramel, mocha, roast malt, oak, raisin ending with some molasses and a hint of coffee bitter. Some hop balancing throughout, but not a real strong presence. Very full bodied and sticky.

I don’t know if I will ever forget this one.  I’ve never tried an imperial stout that I wanted to take deep long drinks from rather than sip.  So rich and sweet and smooth and silky.

Definitely a beer to sip... I could drink one glass of this over the course of several hours and be perfectly content. (2013 & 2014 Bottle Tasting) 13 version was more flavorful and well developed.

Very faint tan film of a head which quickly became little more than a ring with an animated tan on black marble appearance. Very sweet aroma, with tons of roasted malt, espresso, dark fruit, caramel, dark chocolate, vanilla, anise,  and, of course, bourbon. The flavor is initially very sweet roasted  malt. Once swallowed, anise, chocolate and hot alcohol linger. The finish is slow and eventually ends with a good amount of dry oak and a little bit of coffee bitterness.

Moderate sweetness up front, which gives way to some bitterness in the finish. Outstanding mouthfeel. Chewy, full-bodied, without being quite syrupy.

3451,"2008-10-16",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2013 Bottle, 2007 (fresh). Very strong alcohol on the nose. Loads of bourbon taste. Oak a bit heavy for my liking. Vanilla and caramel hints a bit overpowered by it. Mouthfeel is very alcoholic and smoky. Feels like you just left a cigar bar. Still a decent brew that might vastly improve with age. Luckily I picked up two so well see when it makes it way out of the cellar.

Bottle 2008 (10/29/08). Midnight black with a slow moving motion. Very thin burnt color head that laces ever so slightly. Strong strong bourbon nose, German chocolate cake (now I want a piece of cake) and some notes of cherry. Maybe I dont need the cake the flavors do the trick. German chocolate cake flavors, coconut bittersweet chocolate, some real nice vanilla flavors too, caramel malts. Really smooth, rich, and warm feel. This beer is strong but very enjoyable. Have a couple more to age a bit.

Pours a beautiful jet black with a small disappearing brown head. Body is a bit on the oily side. The aromas are all HOT bourbon and oak.

11/26/2010. Drinking a fresh 2010 with a 2008. The 2008 has some pretty substantial oxidation, molten caramel, bourbon without the heat, dark chocolate. The 2010 is rich with dark chocolate, hot bourbon, rich flavors.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"
3451,"2008-10-15",4.6,"UPDATED: JUN 17, 2012 Amazing.  Delicious...  This mammoth stout pours with a black as night, oily, intimidating appearance with a small, dark brown head that forms a short-lived ring around the body.  Not much in the way of lacing, but this beer has long, viscuous, sexy legs that cover the glass after each sip.  The first scent is a complex, nutty coconut aroma, with vanilla, blackberry jam, molasses, almonds, rich, smooth bourbon and an alcoholic punch.  I can hardly find the words to explain the extravagant complexity of the taste.  It is delicious, rich, warming, and fulfilling.  A strong coconut flavor covers the tongue, complemented by a rummy, sticky, coffee liqueuer and chocolate bourbon-ball delightfulness.  I cant use the term ""rich"" enough here.  It is rich, rich, rich- filling and bursting with tongue tingling, warming alcohol.  Still, for 13% abv, this is ridiculously easy and fun to drink.  A thick, velvety, blanketing mouthfeel overwhelms the senses and finishes strong, bright and delicious with lingering coffee, bourbon, oatmeal and almond notes that stick with the tongue for quite some time to come.

I had a bottle of this a couple years ago, and I jumped at the opportunity to try it on tap. I was particularly surprised at how tasty this was considering how not long ago I thought it was a little bit ""overdone"". 
This beer pours a jet black and has a big tan head that settles to a swirl on the top of the beer and leaves some lace. The aromas are of vanilla, oak, whisky and alcohol.  The flavor is remarkable it starts off fairly intensely of roasted, almost burnt malt, which gives way to what can only be described as a strong mocha character displaying plenty of the chocolate and vanilla malt sweetness balanced very nicely with nutty flavors of oak and whisky. This is indeed best when sipped slowly, but there is virtually no alcohol burn, and this is remarkably smooth for all of its character. The only complaint I have is that everything tastes like water after drinking this one.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

3451,"2008-09-28",4.6,"2007 12oz bottle. Pours a very oily looking, jet black. A dark and runny lacing after a minimal chocolate head disappears very quickly. A very strong aroma, I can smell it from at least an arms length away. Lots of vanilla and bourbon. More sweet than roasty although its still present. Woody/oak, dark chocolate caramel, and a mellow fruit background. Fantastic. Mouthfeel is very slick, oily, and smooth with a medium feel. Taste is incredible. Immediate abundance of flavor including chocolate, sweet caramel malts, oak and bourbon casting, and a vanilla backing. The middle kicks in with a very balancing bitterness and a sweet, mellow fruitiness resembling prunes. It finishes incredibly balanced and easy, drying very slowly throughout the aftertaste. Leaves a nice lingering bitterness and a delightful alcohol warmth unlike any beer Ive had. VERY warming. Overall, this is a fantastic imp. stout. I would love to compare this to Bells Expedition.

Mouthfeel is full-bodied, thick viscous texture coats the mouth like motor oil, carbonation is ample.

Drinkability is moderate at 11%, you can definitely feel the alcohol but it is not overwhelming, great mix of malts, dark fruits, hops, the bourbon barrel accents are a great accent that does not hijack the flavor profile, this is deserving of high ratings and I would love to try try again after a few years of cellaring, yum!","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"

3451,"2008-08-17",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 20, 2009 Bottle, 2007. So after 700+ ratings, I cant really add to anything others have said. Its a bourbony beer whose bourbon is less overpowering than many others and whose base stout is better and shows through slightly more than in others. I enjoyed it greatly but I really fail to understand how a beer so dominated by BOURBON could be rated one of the top 50 BEERS out of tens of thousands. Maybe some day Ill learn. 6-4-8-4-15/3.7Rerate from multiple 2008 bottles. So I guess you could say Ive learned now, and this has become one of my favorite beers. For a slow sipper and powerfully bourbony beer, this has to be one of the smoothest out there. No tannic woody notes, instead rich, lovely bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, caramel, molasses, pleasant, warming, sweet alcohol, not at all out of place, very much in place in fact. All in all, leaves nothing to be desired. While still a mood beer for me, one that I find myself increasingly in the mood for.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

I can tell that this is a better bourbon barrel aged beer than a lot of other BBA beers, but I can’t actually taste any of the underlying stout.  I suppose it’s less bourbony than other beers, but it is definitely dominated by the bourbon.  And I don’t want my beer to taste like bourbon, I want it to taste like beer.

First thing first, this god damn thing is a twist off! What are you thinking Goose Island? it even has a trace amount of crust around the twister grove (hopefully it isnt ruined).  Aroma: strong cloud of dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, caramel, and only a faint hint of bourbon.  Pours one of the thicker oil black impy stout pours I have seen.  It was so thick that when trying to pour it from extreme heights to stir up a head, nothing came because it was so soft and dense, and merely absorbed the falling liquid like a trampoline. (4 on appearance b/c I like a big dark head on my impys).  Flavor - holy shit!  Tons of everything good from chocolate, vanilla, smoke, currants, molasses, bourbon, and port.  The alcohol bites pretty hard, but in a very bourbonesque way that warms the stomach very well - I love it.  The thickest and most coating brew to have ever touched my palate - drinking this is like eating a 4 course meal.  Overall - this thing is fucking phenomenal and I must rush to get the last one that was on the self at whole foods to age even further.

Mouthfeel is viscous and oily.  Quite excellent... Ill definitely have to figure out how to get a few more bottles of this...","Washington, USA","pranaferox"

Aroma is incredibly boozy, whiskey, bourbon, vanilla, oak, tobacco leaves, molasses and moist earth.  Big time flavor of vanilla, butterscotch, oak, molasses, caramel syrup, coffee, kahlua and wood.  I expected the flavor to be too much, and actually there was more fruit than I anticipated (cherries, plums, raspberries).  Thick on the tongue, creamy in the throat with a heavy alcohol feel and burn in the throat.

3451,"2008-05-27",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2008 Re-rate 9/30/08. Draft at Clybourn. Poured an opaque black color with a brown head. Smelled of distinct bourbon, vanilla, raisin, date, prune, chocolate, and toffee. Full bodied, sweet, oily, and slick. Carbonation was on the low end of the spectrum. I tasted roasty malt, chocolate, vanilla, toffee, caramel, and bourbon. A bit over-bourbonated, but it works well for this beer.

12oz bottle from iowaherkeye. Thanks Joey. Bottled 7/3/06. Served at cellar temperature. Poured an opaque black color. Head was thick and brown with good retention. A bit of sad looking lace was left behind. Aroma was of bourbon, milk chocolate, soy sauce, and molasses. Sweet, full bodied, and boozy with a warming alcohol effect.

Pours like evil black thick viscous texas crude with a medium sized rich brown head. Aroma of bourbon oh so lovely bourbon, coffee, chocolate, roasted barley and brown sugar. Flavor is tasty chocolate, subtle bourbon, with a nice thick mouthfeel. I love the balance between the bourbon, coffee, and chocolate in this one as well as the full mouthfeel.

3451,"2008-05-23",4.0,"Pours pitch black with very little head and mahogany hints when held up to light.  The aroma certainly doesnt betray the name as the bourbon makes itself known in the aroma with a definite alcohol burn in the nose.  Some malt and smoke in the smell as well with a faint hint of sweetness from caramel and chocolate.  Its really about the bourbon here.  Initial sweet malt flavor with caramel, vanilla and chocolate is quickly blown away by a massive bourbon blast.  The finish is slightly bitter with coffee and smoked wood and leaves a serious aftertaste that lingers for a while.  Despite the alcohol presence, the mouthfeel is extremely creamy and smooth with a nice carbonation complement.  This beer has too much booze to be seriously drinkable, though the mouthfeel belies the bourbon dominance.

Oh well, my thanks are with you, whoever you are.  Pours jet black and thick, as expected, with a small brown head that dissipated quickly.  Aroma of butter and bourbon, some dark chocolate, a bit of grassy hops.  Flavor is complex, with the first thing I notice being that this beer is sweeter than most imperials... which is probably why Im enjoying it more.  Theres lots of complexity, with a bit  of bourbon whiskey dryness, some rich dark chocolate, perhaps the smallest touch of fruitiness.  The alcohol dryness has a bit of smokiness to it.  NIce combination of standard stout flavors with the dry complexity of harder liquor.  Body feels pretty full, but still shy of Kalamazoo or Three Floyds imperial stouts.  A bit of fruity chocolaty sweetness stays with you... a nice change from the bitter finish accompanying most imperials.  One thing I enjoy about imperials is the surprising amount of variety that can be found in their flavor composition.  I can see some imperial fans not liking the lack of coffee flavors or the surprising sweetness, but I find this to be an excellent dessert stout.

3451,"2008-05-02",4.3,"Vintage dated 1/5/05 

Pours oily black and viscous, with not a trace of a head that developes even with an exagerated pour. 
Almost perfectly opaque, with the exeption being the very edge of the body shimmering a crimson-mahogany hue. 
The first whiff has a surprising buisuity note, followed by bourbon, chocolate syrup, and cocoa-dusted espresso beans. 
Further aromatics reveal a slight oaky woodiness, brownie batter, whisky, and shades of kahlua, vanilla, and leather. 
Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Carbonation is extremely mild and barely a notch above a cask ale. 
The pallet delivers big time. Rich and luscious, with a dark chocolate backbone and a bourbon-steeped espresso exterior. 
The bourbon is complementary to the essence of the brew, and a testament to the art of blending barrels. Alcohol is warming at 11%, but the sheer tastiness of the beer keeps you coming back quickly. Finishes with lingering bakers chocolate, kona roast, and malt whiskey. 
I can only speculate that this example has become perfectly balanced in it two years in the cellar.

Taste is full and rich, with an initial taste of vanilla, smoke, and roasted malt giving way to a long, sweet warming finish of anise, caramel, tobacco, and molasses; even at 13% ABV, the alcohol is barely noticeable among the rest of it.

  ?07 Bottle.  Pours dark, dark black and oily with a short lived tan head in a snifter.  Smell is bourbon, oak, then sweet roasty malt.  A fair amount of bourbon in the nose, but not overwhelming.  Taste is oily bourbon woodiness, then bittersweet chocolately roast.  Balanced well, leaning towards a touch more bourbon than most bourbon beers I?ve had.  Very light alcohol in the flavor for 13%, but a slight bit warming.  Rich oily mouthfeel and light, but softly prickling carbonation.  This is damn good.

On rerate its very bourbony in the smell and and taste too.  Too much so, in fact, but it is still enjoyable in sips.  Pretty one dimensional actually and this dropped a lot from what I initially thought of it years ago.  The booze is hidden well, but it is just not that drinkable to me, as the intense bourbon flavor makes it almost too vanilla like and sweet to be something I seek out again.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

Sweet but delicious and complex beer, with an astonishing aroma and flavor and a long lasting finish.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
3451,"2008-03-23",4.7,"12 oz. bottle. Kudos to both Acknud & BBB63 for sending me a bottle of this magic elixer. Pours a deep black with a very small brown head. Nose is semi sweet molasses & alcohol. A subtle brew it is not. Mouthfeel is smooth, but heavy & warm. Almost like brandy or port. Taste is a complex mix of molasses, Semi sweet chocolate, a ton of malt, dark wet earth & of coarse bourbon. Makers Mark, Jack Daniels, doesnt matter, take your pick.

3451,"2008-03-23",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2008 2006 vintage (bottled 7/3/06). (also my 100th rating).  Geez, this poured pitch black with the consistency of motor oil.  Just wow.  Dark as night with an almost non-existent tan head.  Gorgeous.  The aroma is wonderful with chocolate, vanilla with a not overwhelming presence of bourbon.  I tried a 2007 bottle a few weeks ago and the bourbon was much more pronounced.  Letting it sit for almost two years has definitely calmed it down for what I feel is the better.  It definitely becomes more noticeable as the beer warms.  Flavor has the same components of vanilla, chocolate, smokiness, bourbon, a sticky caramel.  Its so much.  This stuff is as smooth as silk to drink too.  Slight alcohol burn in the finish, but just wow.  Cant wait to let the remaining bottles I have left to age a bit more for drinking.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","hillfiiiiire"
3451,"2008-03-22",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2009 Very complex beer.  The flavor is like walking through a very old forest, where light and shadows plays, sounds of birds and bugs, aromas of earth, trees and brush  and decay demand attention.  It is hard to focus on everything at once, and several of the things you sense may on their own be unpleasant, but taking in all at once, concentrating on the whole and not the parts, is an experience not soon to be forgotten.  I am happy to have experienced it, but also will not desire it again, at least for a very long time.  (The time has come to re-rate.  My first was 3.8, and either I was crazy, got a bad bottle, or have just changed.  I love this one, and have put up a few.  Huge malted milk ball flavor with hints of bourbon.  Alcohol well hid, but with pleasing warmth.  Great aftertaste, like what is left in your mouth after a fantastic chocolate malted mild shake.)","Minnesota, USA","EHopper"

Probably the most complex beer Ive ever enjoyed.   Finish is smooth and smoky with nice alcohol warming the throat.

Flavor is just as big as the nose, and just as delicious: huge dark malt, massive bourbon, chocolate, some coffee. Undeniably smooth drinking. Palate is thick, coats the mouth. Finishes long and smooth. Beer is definitely a slow sipper, but even with the bourbon taste, its smoother than any bourbon. 

Rerate - bottle, 2007, aged 3-4 months. A little age greatly reign in the vanilla and bourbon notes, and the alcohol to a lesser degree, bringing up the coffee and roast malt notes. I actually prefer the rawer, fresher version.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","JohnQPublic"

The taste was dominated by a bourbon and woody quality, also some malt and a bit of bitter hops. Overall, quite earthy and warm. Really nice, Id love to share one of these with some Whiskey drinkers. Its what a great beer should be; well made and interesting. Re-rate: 2008 edition, three years old.

3451,"2008-03-08",3.7,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip.  Let me add my disclaimer right now.  I do not like bourbon.  I dont like the way it smells or tastes.  GIBCS pours beautifully black with a carmel-colored head that quickly settles.  The aroma is overwhelmingly bourbon along with toffee, vanilla and charred wood.  You can smell this beer from across the room.  The flavor is extremely complex with raisin, dried apricot, bourbon (of course), alcohol, chocolate pudding, coffee and a ton of other things that are blasted away by the second sip.  This beer is way too complex to adequately rate with one bottle.  By the second sip your taste buds are destroyed to subtlety.  I can say that Im already past the bourbon smell and taste.  It is blessedly not overpowering with the rest of the flavors.  The palate is oily and chewy.  The after taste is long and thick.  You wont get away from this beer anytime soon.

Deep roasted coffee bean and freshly cooked chocolate pudding all wrapped together w/ a stinging asprin bittering.  This stuff is amazing. Its chunky, chewy, warming, and very generous.

3451,"2008-03-04",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 19, 2008 Bottled: 10/11/07. Tasted 3/3/08. This baby pours dark as night. I tried to get some light to permeate this bad boy, but no go. Pretty much no head though. The bourbon definitely makes itself known, but I wouldnt say its overpowering. Once it warms up, the bourbon comes out even more in the aroma. At that point, its a little too much and you have to blast through it to get to the other characteristics. What you do get there is more caramel and even toffee sweetness than I expected. Theres still dark dark malts to be had, but they come out more in the taste and finish. Speaking of the taste: bourbon hits you up front, but it settles down into dark bitter & roasted malts and some coffee, and even less chocolate. Theres some semi-sweet malt flavors that help balance out the dark bitterness. Bourbon comes out more in the beginning of the finish. Burns the throat more as it warms. Finishes like a dream. Nice and bitter malty, with some  overlying sweetness again, but the emphasis is on the roasty & bitter. Even though its still a bit hot for my tastes, the mouthfeel is so silky and voluptuous, it just had to be a 5.

Bottled 10/11/07. Tasted: 10/19/08. 
Disappointment was had here. The aroma kinda does smell like a cigar. The 2007 is definitely starting to oxidize. The bourbon has mellowed some but it hasn’t really caused the other flavors develop or come out more. I hope my other 2 bottles don’t oxidize as well.

3451,"2008-02-12",3.1,"I love a good Bourbon Stout, in fact I would say it is my favorite type of beer.  So when I saw this available, I happily paid the $15 for a 4-pack.  This was a major disappointment to me.  Not that its a terrible drink (and I say drink because this is much stronger than your normal microbrew beer), but because of the price and hype surrounding it.  The aroma is sweet like a good bourbon, the pour is as dark as old motor oil.  But the taste is overwelming.  The bourbon taste far overpowers all other ingredients.  I was able to pick up the coffee and vanilla in the aftertaste, but the initial is like a shot of whiskey.  This is definitely not a drinking beer, but a sipping beer.  This would be a great beer to enjoy on a cold night in front of a fire reading a good book.  Not so much if youre going to a frat kegger.

3451,"2008-02-11",4.4,"2005 vintage consumed in February 2008.  Whoa!  This brew screams bourbon!  As soon as I cracked the top, a massive nose of kentucky bourbon laden chocolate and nougat malts hit me like a ton of bricks.  The thick, syrupy, opaque mahogany liquid exudes fumy notes of vanilla and burnt caramel over the silky dark chocolate malts and omnipresent bourbon.  The aroma is nothing short of fantastic, and it transitions perfectly into the luxurious, intense flavor.  Dark chocolate and caramel caress the tongue, while the intense bourbon melts perfectly into the fold.  There is a perfectly complimentary smoky taste that sticks to the roof of the mouth and the edges of the tongue.  This brew is masterfully crafted in its use of massive amounts of malt to balance out the huge bourbon notes.  I cant believe how well this has held up after nearly three years.  My only knock is on appearance, which would certainly garner a perfect score save for the lack of a head or lacing, a condition that is most likely due to the brews age. A thick viscous body drinks incredibly smooth for such a huge beer, though it falls just short on carbonation levels.  I will revisit this beauty as often as possible, as this is truly one of the classics.  EXCELLENT!","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

3451,"2008-01-30",3.2,"UPDATED: OCT 24, 2012 2012 Bottle, 
this beer had a black pour, the pour looked thick, syrupy like, there was a thin dark tan colored head that receded to a patch of bubbles in the center of the beer and a small ring, this beer was too dark to see through but I saw some bubbles flowing up the sides of the glass and there was a dime size mound of bubbles on top of the beer, 
there was some spots and small fingers of lacing that flowed off the glass, there was no sediment in the bottle, 

the aroma was bourbon alcohol with a bit of a bite on the nostrils, vanilla, chocolate liquor, roasted malt, 
faint chocolate, the bourbon was dominant on the nose, everything else took a backseat to the bourbon, 

the flavor was big bourbon alcohol and sweetness, chocolate, some roasted malt, vanilla, chocolate cake sweetness, 
very sweet on the mouth, 

the mouth feel was thick and syrupy like, it coated the tongue and gave a alcohol bite that tingles the nostrils, 

this beer was very bourbon and very sweet, a bit too much sweetness for me to enjoy, maybe, I hope this version of BCS calms down with aging, I can only take small sips of this drink, way too sweet to drink more than a small glass, I would only enjoy this in small quantity on a cold Winter day, I liked the 13% alc. BCS much more, glad I have a few older bottles in my stash.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"
3451,"2008-01-29",2.1,"It says Bourbon on the label and this ""beer"" is certainly that.  It is a brutal beer because of its ABV.  The alcohol is not hidden, its pretty up front and in your face.

Its got legs and is so thick that it stains the glass and creates a mirror finish of the surface. The nose is rich complex, with chocolate dipped cherries, vanilla and wood from the cask, with a whisper of bourbon. The flavour is smokey, sweet and earthy with bourbon, charred wood, hop bitterness, star anise, rich chocolate, hints of bourbon and nougat. The booze comes through with a nice warming in the finish.

Overwhelming aroma of bourbon to this one.  Maybe some chocolate lingering somewhere in the background but this is definitely all good ol Kentucky Bourbon.

Im amazed at how smooth and tasty this beer is.  This is what all barrel aged stouts should strive to acheive.  The bourbon taste is definitely prevalent but its as smooth as a babys behind.  Some roasted malts and chocolate are there too but its mostly smooth ass bourbon.

The aroma is extreamly strong filled with burbon,wood,and chocolate. As it warmed up and i took a sip my mought was filled with chocolate burbon bitterness which was so awesome.

3451,"2008-01-26",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2008 Poured from a 12oz bottle (2007 vintage) and served in a snifter.  This beer poured a pitch black with a few red highlights around the edges of the glass and a short-lived tan head.  A small amount of oily, slippery lacing was left around the glass.  The aroma of the beer was made up of smooth bourbon, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, French roast coffee beans, and charred malts.  The flavor consisted of rich, bittersweet chocolate, aged bourbon, vanilla/oak, light caramel, and burnt malts.  The mouthfeel was definately full-bodied, but it seemed a bit thin for the style, perhaps a byproduct of the barrel-aging.  The carbonation was minimal.  An amazingly balanced and flavorful imperial stout.  Not the best of the best, but definately first class.  Well done Goose.","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

However, as it warms up more, the complexity begins to show.  Not quite as good tasting as I had hoped, but still very good.  Roasted malt, bourbon, with some vanilla and caramel.  Some alcohol, although pretty well hidden.  A little bit of chocolate and wood as well.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"

The 07 Bourbon County Stout pours black as a moonless night. Not a shred of light can fight its way through the blackness. An aggressive pour yields only a small crown of tan foam which is to be expected with the massive abv. The head settles to a ring and leaves patches of lace after each sip. 

As you take your first whiff youre hit with a big dose of vanilla from the barrel aging. Traces of bourbon come next followed by a mellow oakiness. The barrel aging runs throughout but is greeted and embraced by a big roastiness, caramel maltiness, and a smattering of dark fruit. Theres even a ghost-like smokiness floating around in there. 

There is a great stout in here but the barrel aging makes it world class. All the qualities from the aroma are right here in the flavor with the bourbon, vanilla, and a touch of woodiness working throughout. If this beer was aged any longer the bourbon would overpower everything else, if it was aged any less the bourbon wouldnt have been able to stand up to such a big robust stout. A slice of heaven in a glass.

Thick and rich mouthfeel but exquisitly smooth. The carbonation is on the sluggish side which lets this silky body glide through slowly and coats every tastebud. The alcohol warms the throat on the swallow.

I cant give a stout this big abv wise a perfect score for drinkability but this is as close as it could get. A sipper without a doubt but one to sip and savor all night long.

One of my favorites from Goose Island and one of my favorite stouts. The barrel aging sets this beer apart from the other great stouts. Absolutely delicious.

3451,"2008-01-19",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 20, 2009 We talk about pouring pitch black, but this time I mean it.  No head whatsoever.  Aroma is chocolate, charred oak, some smokiness, and a bit of vanilla.

The flavor has a solid dark fruit foundation, some yeast, molasses, vanilla, chocolate, not bitter, port, sweet,  and wood - flavor is perfect.  The beer grows warmer on this twenty below Minnesota night and only gets more sweet and complex.  This beer is the thing for tonight.  I chose wisely.

The flavor is pleasingly complex right off the bat. Cherry and dark fruits hit immediately, then that hazelnut again. Smoke and coffee notes dance around with some sweet tobacco and alcohol.

Very dark brown to black in color with a dark tan colored head that quickly dissipated leaving nothing more than a few islands of carbonation in the glass, no lacing. Initial smell was a bit disappointing but as this one warmed it got vastly better and I found chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and of course coffee aromas. Others have said how much the bourbon stands out, to me it was definately present, but I found the chocolate and coffee flavors to be much more dominant and much to my delight. Mouthfeel is thick and full bodied with low carbonation, just how I think it should be. Im stuck on where to rate this for drinkability; it was very enjoyable throughout, but it is a sipper.

It is most similar to Dogfish Head WWS and Southern Tier Jah*va, both of which are more complex, less cloying and have more ""stoutlike"" qualities. The WWS is a great after dinner apertif served in a small snifter and the Jah*va is just a great beer. This is way too sweet to be called a stout.","New York, USA","southamptonsam"

Poured an inky black color with a fine tan head that dissolves into a ring.  Good aroma of bourbon, vanilla, oak, along with some chocolate and coffee.  Slight bourbon tingle greets the tongue upon entering the mouth, leading into a sweet, malty middle with strong flavors of chocolate and coffee, with hints of vanilla and oak, and finishes with a smooth bourbon taste.  Smooth and creamy on the palate with a slight tingle from the bourbon.  Definitely a great beer, I cant wait to see what some age does to it.  Thanks again Pepsi!","Aurora, Colorado, USA","BlackForestCO"

12oz bottle courtesy of Gillard. This one has eluded me for quite a while for various reasons, so I was super excited to try it. Motor oil looking black pour, glugs and glops out of the bottle. Smallish dark mocha-tan head, very bubbly and loosely formed. Nice retention and sheet lacing. On the nose the bourbon is very apparent, along with dark chocolate, raisins, malts, coffee beans, licorice, and some fusel alcohol. Its actually not super apparent, even at 13%, which is a nice surprise. Very chewy and chalky, tastes like a chocolate brownie with a huge kick of alcohol mixed in. Dark malts, raisins, bourbon, bakers chocolate and tart fruits are present as well, adding to the mix. Wonderful mouthfeel, just how I want a beer of this style to be. Almost have to chew this one to get it down, which is perfect. Finish is boozy, sweet chocolate and fruits, and extremely lengthy. Very warming as a result of the ABV, but its really quite masterfully kept in check throughout the range of the beer. Masterpiece.","Tampa, Florida, USA","Quake1028"

The coffee flavor comes through more in the flavor, smoky, rich, and oily.  The flavors really stick.  A burning bourbon flavor.  Vanilla, coconut and cocoa swirling together....think Almond Joy.

3451,"2007-12-10",4.3,"Bottle.  Year 2007.  Thick black pour with a very, very minimal head which dissolved right away into a light brown ring around the top of the beer.  So black, it looks like a strong pot of coffee that was brewed then poured back into the coffee maker and brewed again through new grounds.  Initial smell of caramel, lots of roasted malt, wood and a hint of smoke.  Upon tasting, the first word that came out of my mouth was, WOW.  I cant think of a better word to describe what I experienced in one sip.  The vanilla flavor becomes more apparent upon tasting.  It doesnt just coat the tongue, it coats the entire mouth.  Very smooth with a nice finish.  Since I dont smoke cigars, I decided to try this with a cigarette.  The cig only distracted away from the palate.

Pours like motor oil; thick, black and sticky.  Not a whole lot of carbonation present,  small dusty brownish/red head.   This is a sipping beer for sure.  Body is very syrupy.  The flavor is dominated by the bourbon and I like bourbon so thats a good thing.   It has a little of everything, some chocolate, some raisins, nuts, vanilla and a little smoke...none more than the other.  The bourbon puckers your mouth around the long lasting roasted malt in the finish.  A cigar would be good right now!  Now it tastes just like a German chocolate cake. 9 5 19 4 18. . . . . . . . . . . . .
bottle dated 1.10.07 (10.11.07???) enjoyed 12.20.08. Big bourbon aroma noticeable 5 feet away from the glass, really nice bourbon aroma actually, very woody, coconuts macaroons, very rich syrupy chocolate,  raisins, avoid swirling as it releases too much alcohol in the nose.  Pours a syrupy very dark brown near black with a very small creamy tan head.  Very thick and velvety first taste, super smooth, wow has this matured beautifully.  Loads of creamy dark chocolate, surprisingly not sweet, lightly nutty, hint of coconut from the barrel but not overbearing,  great bourbon flavor with a nice light kick in the finish.  Long bitter dark chocolate raisin aftertaste.  Full bodied, smooth silky carbonation with a syrupy finish. 9 5 10 4 19. near perfect and so so warming. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
bottle dated 08.16.05 enjoyed 10.03.09 at room-temp, so a little over 4 years old, listed at 11%.  Pours an opaque glossy brownish black with a smaller fizzy mocha head, aroma is chalky, nutty, sweet but stale raisins, big bourbon, dark chocolate, varnish/nail polish remover, doesnt smell very sweet at all but rather stale, saw-dust, raisins and bourbon.  That is quite different in flavor, mellowed but still very alcohol forward, the sweetness is completely gone, vanished, but the big viscous body remains, bitter-sweet bakers chocolate, some chocolate syrup towards the finish with lingering chocolate and an alcohol burn.  The flavor is very good, and substantially different than later vintages, it has actually mellowed and amalgamated into something very simple and pure.  The huge bourbon and coconut that are super present in later vintages are also missing, well, they are there but very much kept in check. Full bodied, super smooth and creamy, faint larger bubbly carbonation , lightly oily. Off-flavor oxidation is really minimal which is really impressive.  This is #($($*($ delicious!

3451,"2007-12-05",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2008 This is like a bullet in the tongue.  The aged quality and the calibre of bourbon make for a sharpened smoke that impales your mouth and bastes it with maple, charcoal, sweet black licorice, dry dark chocolate and the bitterness of having to drink different beers afterward.  The head alone is an achievement: a color of dusty brown caramel sage like bull blood on the plains of Wyoming.  Simply amazing.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"

A lovely wafting aroma of malts, bourbon, and vanilla, the thick, oily brew is very appetizing. As it warms (and warms the drinker!), its complexity really comes through. Its not merely thick in the sense that its soupy, but rather is robust, solid, with character. Its not simply malty and roasty, a fist to the face like so many impy stouts, but has a really broad profile, with subtle coffee roasts, abundant chocolate aromas, slight smoke, and molasses coming through. Smooth and velvety in the mouthfeel too, making it an awesome sipper. I need more.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

It takes several moments for anything but the intense bourbon to become apparent.  Vanilla, chocolate covered cherries, oak, milk chocolate, malted milk balls all become apparent beneath the ever strong bourbon.  Awesome aroma.  Taste is super rich, super roasty, thick and creamy with a bit of alcohol at the finish but not nearly as much as a fresh bourbon aged 13%ABVer could be.  This is amazing.

Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Superb aroma of raisins and chocolate. Like a cross between a traditional imperial stout and a barley wine in smell. Pours a dark brown with tan head. Bourbon obvious in the boozy taste. Sweet chocolate flavor. Dry finish. Long, bitter, dark chocolate aftertaste. Medium to heavy body. Soft in the palate. Excellent palate sensations. This was my second favorite beer of the thirteen I tried at the tasting. My favorite was Big Eddy Imperial Stout. I ended up rating Goose Island Bourbon County Stout a tenth of a point higher due to a superior aroma and palate, but I preferred the flavor of Big Eddy and gave it a higher overall score. 9/4/8/5/17=>4.3. Re-rate, 2-19-16: 15 oz at Minnibar at MSP airport. Consumed on 2.8.16. Dark brown. Silky appearance. Small amount dark taupe to gray / light brown head. Raisin and milk chocolate scents. Smells great. Vanilla. Bourbon. A bit of boozy sharpness in the aroma. Milk chocolate flavor. Delicious. Slightly bitter finish. Peaches and cream. Boozy hotness in the finish. Light to moderate burn in the aftertaste. A lot of booze. Reasonably lively. Medium to full body, not as full as I would expect. Smooth in the palate.

Aroma is huge of bourbon with the alcohol coming through stronger as it warmed. Towards the end it actually burned my nose to smell it, and that I did not particularly care for. Taste is quite sweet up front, then bourbon and a lot of chocolate that blends in beautifully. A little vanilla and coconut is also in there. Extremely thick mouthfeel, but also very smooth. Probably top 3 as far as thickest I have encountered so far.

The bourbon is still there in the aroma and taste, but the chocolate has faded quite a bit.  The taste is what has dropped off most significantly, with the sweet caramel and alcohol definitely still present, but overshadowed by the malt.

3451,"2007-11-06",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2010 12 oz. Bottle from Johns Grocery (Iowa City, IA). Poured into a tulip glass. The pour is like literally pouring used motor oil into a glass. Thick, dark, and hardly making a splash at all. This leads to a practically non-existent head with a dark cocoa color. Light smell on the beer that resembles chocolate and vaguely of bourbon. I do indeed get a faint vanilla in the smell after pour. Initial taste extremely powerful yet smooth. Sweet bourbon and coffee tastes. I almost feel like Ive smoked a cigar with the smokey finish it leaves. This stout definately thumps its chest and lets you know its there. Becomes more friendly on the warm up and as the alcohol settles into me. Definately for sipping. Definately for dessert. I havent had many Imperial Stouts. But, this is a good start.

Rerate: 2009 Batch: Pours like oil, pitch black with a small dark brown head that dissipates to a layer that laces ok. Aromas are heavenly, a big dose of Bourbon and roasted malts, sweeter edges with chocolate and caramel in heavy doses, smooth and velvety. Initial is thick bodied with a heavy dose of bourbon, wet oak, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, caramel sweetness definitely evident. This stout is slanted away from bitterness, towards barrel and malt presence, sweet and complex, the beer slides down, a warming sensation, with good coffee, roasted malts, barrel, and chocolate in bitter and sweet layers.

Full-bodied and slick with tongue prickling carbonation and significant alcohol warmth. The flavor is bourbon forward and fairly hot at this time. Also present are vanilla, chocolate and plum notes along with a woody vinous quality. This is a really nice beer as it is, but I have to think that this will mellow nicely with time.

Both the Bourbon barrel and the alcohol are very evident. The former provides the woody, vanilla notes that emerge throughout. The latter provides a hot aftertaste that I found a little too intrusive. Not convinced the elements were perfectly knitted together, which knocks the overall score down a shade but thats only really a minor quibble. All in all I thought this was a very fine beer.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
3451,"2007-11-03",4.4,"2007 Bottle:Deep pitch black coloured body with an almost non-existant tan head. Aroma of pure bourbon - the strongest ive ever smelt. Raisins, figs, cherries, espresso and milk chocolate all are noticeable in the nose coupled with the ever present vanilla. Full-bodied; Super-strong malty, chocolate and of course, scotchy taste. An amazing vanilla and oaky taste most potent with the bittering characteristics of coffee and pit fruits. Aftertaste shows so much and lasts longer than I could remember for any beer. Overall, a really good and strong imperial stout with plenty of oaky and sweet characteristics. One that should be sampled by all, if possible. I sampled this 12 ounce bottle purchased from West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, Illinois on 02-November-2007.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
3451,"2007-11-02",5.0,"Got the 2007 release this week and it blew my socks off.  Best beer I have ever had, hands down no contest.  Its a sticky, thick, sweetish crazy combination.  The bourbon taste is obvious, very oaky.  I have never had some of the other high powered midwestern stouts, but if they are better than this I will be shocked.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","WickerBrew"
3451,"2007-11-01",4.8,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2007 2006 vintage; huge thanks to my buddy Russ for holding onto this one till I could get back to Chicago.  Pour is pitch black; a bit thin, and has the thinnest of a dark tan head; almost non-existent.  Aroma has strong hints of bourbon, vanilla and lighter hints of milk chocolate and brown sugar.  Very heavy mouthfeel, the first thing that comes to mind is Amazing!  Id wager that about 4 out of 5 times I go after a beer Ive been yearning to try, I leave disappointed, but not this time!  This sludge almost does the opposite of what I expected...hits up hard early with the bourbon, vanilla, smoky/tobacco and dark chocolate flavors and mellows just beautifully mid-drink, turning very soft with light chocolate flavor, sugary malts, and a beautiful, mellow warming at the end.  Do yourself a favor...just hold some of this on the tongue for a bit and enjoy the beauty!  Dare I say this is the first heavily hyped and desired brew that has actually exceeded my expectations.  Minimal burn, especially for an 11% ABV and wow, what a wonderful sipper...damn near a perfect 5, but still leaving some room for improvement
 
Re-rate:  2007 vintage...much livelier, stronger bourbon presence, especially on palate.  Tobacco notes more pronounced.  Alcohol much stronger presence.  Beer still excellent, but not the oh my God I had with the one-year-aged 2006.

3451,"2007-10-23",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2009 12oz. bottle, July 2006 vintage.  Luscious aroma of rich dark chocolate, bittersweet cocoa powder, creamy milk chocolate, sweet vanilla, roasty espresso, plum, toffee, aged, burnt sugars and bourbon-soaked wood.  A tempting prelude to what lies ahead.  Thickly opaque ebony color with a light brown head forming a ring around the walls of the snifter.  Flavor is satisfyingly powerful and robust, with layers of rich chocolate, dark caramel sweetness and maple sugar blended with unfathomable depths of roasty malt, dried fruits, and, towards the incredibly long finish, a brief glimpse of spicy hop bitterness, lingering cola and earthy bourbon barrel accents.  Warming, exceedingly smooth, enveloping mouthfeel, body is vast and full.  Nicely complex, almost luxurious in nature.  Very impressive indeed.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

Very nice, but Im missing the bourbon.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","TheBeerOrg"
3451,"2007-10-19",3.4,"I am not a huge fan of bourbon-y beers (yet I love bourbon), but this one appealed to me.  Its flavor is bourbon-y but also smokey and roasty and definitely complicated.  Mouthfeel was about right...what I expected from this.  The beer was viscous, but not over-the-top the way I found Sam Adams Triple Bock to be.  I have a friend whos a huge fan of beer, and while I find hoppy and sour to be more appealing beer flavors, I can certainly understand the appeal of this beer.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

Initially it looks like its flat and has no head, but upon closer inspection you see tiny microbubbles of carbonation forcing their way through the thick as mud liquid.  Glass feels heavy when filled with this monster too.  Bourbon is clearly evident on the first whiff after opening the bottle.  Smelled from the glass some nice oak highlights, combined with chocolate, bourbon, maltiness, and a hint of oxidation.  First sip is great.  Lots of flavor, some alchohol burn, plenty of sweetess.  Tons of body.  A very tasty sipper.  Certainly best with cheese.  Maybe I should give it a 4.2?  Nah.  Mostly because drinkability is slightly lower.  A great and interesting beer though.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
3451,"2007-09-30",4.3,"My rating no. 1360, bottle obtained from porterhouse - thanks, Kevin!  Bottled 8/16/05, drunk 9/30/07, fill line is high, right up on the crown.  OMG huuuuge syrupy, medicinal chocolate and bourbon nose, loads and loads of non-roasted malt filling the room.  Lesser notes of vanilla and wood, a touch of soy with some alcohol leaking in.  Bourbon tends to dominate the other notes.  Silky, soul-sucking black pour, opaque pitch resting body with a lacing, rocky, and tiny-bubbled dark brown head - gorgeous, dense stuff!  Flavors only intensify with warmth.  Taste is fat malt and predominately sweet bourbon, light wood to compliment and vanilla that sticks to the teeth and gums.  Chocolate and light notes of roast.  Touch of sweet burn (as the charred innards of a barrel might taste).  Obesely thick body, very smooth, syrupy with slight pricking in the beginning and at the end.  A long, really pleasant warming that settles in and wraps around you like a familiar blanket.   I suppose this goes under straightforward rather than complex, but the designations not used pejoratively.   Definitely a sipper (a bit of a kick to the face at times).  Rich, relaxing, and - most importantly - a lot of fun!Have to wonder if the roast was much stronger when this was fresh and just died over the last two years, or if this is the finished version.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Bottle at Chris_Os HogTownHarry minifest. Thanks to Harry. Thick opaque black with a slim tan head. Aroma of bourbon, peat. malt and sweet caramel notes. Flavour is more of the same but once in the mouth the bourbon becomes a little too much for me. Just a little less and it really could be excellent. Lovely tangy malt but it is all overshadowed by all the bourbon. Still a mighty fine beer though.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

Flavour - oh yeah, this is good - lots of vanilla and oak, some molasses, caramel, coffee, chocolate... mmmmm.

I usually take in the aroma before a taste but just the look of this beer overcame me and demanded a sip (Im weak). Cripes! This luscious a taste shouldnt be legal. OK, back to the aroma. The nose is pretty darn big with some bourbon, wood, rich coffee mixed with sweet molasses, dark chocolate, burnt malts and brownies swimming in a thin layer of alcohol. This elixir sludges across my palate with a thick ponderous mouth feel. The taste is much like aroma with bourbon, oak and alcohol starting off. Then the sweeter notes arrive with molasses, sweetened coffee then hints of caramel and toffee. Into the finish the burnt flavors build into sort of burnt fudge brownies sensation. Wow, the after taste goes on forever. YUMM!","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

3451,"2007-09-08",3.5,"Very black in colour, thin tan coloured head that quickly dissipates into a ring around the glass, light lacing along with some alcohol lacing.  The aroma is very bourbony, some chocolate, lots of vanilla, cream and lots of alcohol.  The flavour wasnt as alcohol filled as I would have thought, the vanilla doesnt hide itself, extreme sweetness, very malty, lots of chocolate.  Surprisingly smooth and creamy mouthfeel, medium/large body, medium carbonation.  Finishes with lots of alcohol, very long and very sweet.  Pretty alcohol, very overpowering at times.

3451,"2007-07-09",4.4,"2005 and 2006 side by side. Minor differences, the only which were notable were a thicker mouthfeel and bolder flavor from the 05. Pours pitch  raven black, oily and discernibly incredibly thick. A thin dark brown head forms atop the body, motionless after coagulation. the head, along with the fantastic lacing it dragged behind, would manage to mostly last through the entire length of the quaff. The aroma is vicious and unforgettable. Never has so much whisky been so seemlessly integrated, yet so pronounced and crushing. An amazing feat of barrel. Charred oak notes and vanilla follow, then monumental roasted malt, bittersweet dark chocolate, licorice in moderation, sweet dark fruits and apricot puree. Alcohol is moderate to heay, and in the earlier batch hasnt faded much, so its definitely a sipper. The flavor almost warrants a 10, if not for the heavy alcohol Id probably award that perfect score. Bitterness is medium-high, sweetness is as well, combining to create some absurd extreme balance. Coffee, chocolate, light anise and wave after pounding wave of bourbon light up the tastebuds. The taste is really frenzied and complex. Fruit notes are mild and almost lost in the presence of the alcohol. Finishes lightly acidic, lightly bitter and very roasty, chocolate notes lingering. Alcoholic warmth is substantial. The mouthfeel is very creamy, lightly carbonated and lightly tannic. Full bodied would be a gross understatement. A marvelous beer, expressing both power and beauty equally and gracefully.

Sweeter than I anticipated, with a warm, smooth bourbon finish that sticks on your teeth and gums till you lick it off. Full-bodied with moderate carbonation.  Velvety and a bit syrupy.

Wonderful aroma of bourbon and oak wood, with vanilla, espresso, licorice and currants. Flavor blew me away, wow! Tons of coffee, roasted malt, stained oak wood, vanilla and black cherry.

3451,"2007-06-25",4.2,"This beer is a great example of what I call ""purposeful excess.""  Anyone can overload a batch of beer with malt or hops, but the challenge is to make it a great beer in the process, and Goose Island has succeeded with this one.  There are red highlights as you pour it, but it sits instensely black in the glass, with a thin, mocha-colored head.  The aroma is all bourbon.  The flavor is amazing, coffee-and-chocolate-noted malt intensity with loads of bourbony earthiness.  Unlike many bourbon barrel-aged beers, the liquor flavors dont come through in any way as brandy -- its much more of a true bourbon flavor.  The malty whallop is great, and yet theres a back-taste thats almost reminiscent of port wine.  The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, but aromatic  yes, like bourbon.  So, so satisfying.  But heres the nit -- twelve ounces is too much, and its hard for me to find someone to share this with.  The second six ounces arent quite as enjoyable as the first six.  If Goose Island would put this in a smaller bottle, Id buy it a lot more.","Hartland, Wisconsin, USA","Flyer"
3451,"2007-06-25",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2008 Bottle. Pours black. No light can even think about penetrating this. Looks oily. Gentle swirling leavs some sticky brown/amber legs on the side of my glass. Beautiful nose of vanilla, charred oak, toffee, malt, wet campfire smoke, dark melting chocolate, Door County cherries, raisins and alcohol. Damn. Moderate carbonation on the palate, but still quite rich and sticky. Quite silky and lush. Flavor: rich malt gives way to a nice pleasant dry hoppy finish. Along the way we get oak, vanilla, blackstrap molasses, chocolate chip cookie dough. A hint of wine-like alcohol. Bourbon-lke flavors begin to develop after a while. Rich chocolate and brewed coffee goodness. One truly amazing creation.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
3451,"2007-06-15",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2010 Re-rate, Mar. 10: This one upped my previous experiences, bottle from Stateline. The chocolate-mocha flavors really enhanced the overall experience. It was still overdone in bourbon in the aroma and fore-flavors, but as it settled on the tongue, the mocha finish was really quite wonderful. Vinous notes there along the way too. Alcohol a tad on the hot side. Must save the other bottle for a little age. My opinion rises from just above average to a bit higher. Re-rate, Jan 08, bottle at Durty Nellies: Unmoved this time around, my original rating stands, other than the fact that the wood notes didnt come out as strong. I twas a vinous-choco type impy stout with some chalky notes. If you go impy on me, it should impress, if you bourbon age it, it should impress further and be short of over-run with bourbon. Original rating: Bottle courtesy beerded_one. Poured black like an imperial stout, chocolate colored head. The aroma was strong wood, lots of bourbon, rum soaked raisins. The flavor was sticky bourbon, maple, vanilla, chocolate/cocoa, oak, and finishing with a touch of marshmallows (dont think Ive ever written that in a beer review?). The flavor and finish was a tad hot, and the mouthfeel a little too sweet and sticky. Put this one away if you can hold your pants on, would be better after another year. For now, a little stick, hot, and over-done on the bourbon side, which most tend to do with this style. An enjoyable beer in all respects, yet relative to its bourbon aged peers, probably about average. Thanks, Paul, an opportunity Im very appreciative of. Thanks for sharing!","","User37895"

Plenty of brown sugar struggling to keep pace with the alcohol that isnt all that well hidden.  I taste the whiskey, I taste the smoke, the coffee all underneath that damned sugary sweetness.

Wow, serious alcohol warming.  Intense smooth, buttery, woody flavors.  Cherry, licorice, raisin.  Light prickly carbonation.  Not really sweet, but far from dry.  A touch roasty, but just a touch.  A little bitterness in the back there, but no real hoppiness.  Grainy flavor and palate.  Actually reminding me a good bit of Mephistopheles (recent batch) which isnt a huge compliment, but its better than that.  I guess theres vanilla.  One strong point is the ability to flow between a grainy, deep palate and a rich, smooth one.  Really leaves my mouth stinging long after each sip from the alcohol burn.  Not sweet, but leaving my lips sticky like candy does.  Definitely has a charred wood flavor too.  OK, so this is complex, but it doesnt feel really well crafted.  The flavors just kinda push each other around and all show up, but they dont blend and enhance one another like in some beers.  Truth is, though, I generally dont care for bourbon beers.  This one is actually extremely hard to rate.  Its complex and tasty, but has what I perceive to be flaws, yet others may not.  Also, in the interest of full disclosure, I didnt sleep last night, and I have 8 hours of sleep over the past three nights.  This one 12 oz bottle is hitting me hard.

Flavor:  Lots of sweet roasted malt with notes of coffee, chocolate, dried cherries, light smoke and anise.  A strong dose of caramel.

Poured a opaque blackish brown with a small foamy, creamy tan head, decent retention, small amount of sticking.

A delicious sipper, coffee, caramel toffee, roasted grains, vanilla barrel flavor and a little charred wood, a subtle berry fruitiness, the alcohol is pretty well balanced, presence, but only providing a low temperature warmth that increases the drinkability, not a hot alcohol taste bud killer, towards the end earthy grains and oak woody flavors emerges, the hops are pretty laid back, and a dryish caramel malty and vanilla barrel finish, quite enjoyable overall.-- Bottling date 07.03.06, everything else is pretty much the same as last year, allowed to warm up before sampling in a broad mouth chalice.

Poured a blackish coffee brown with a nice sized creamy, bubbly tan head that settled into a thin sudsy lacing, minimal amount of sticking.

Not quite the boozy nose as last year, much more vanilla and caramel, cherries, charred wood, bare hints of liquid smoke, and soft whiffs of clear grainy alcohol.

Good, steady moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry, slick, creamy smooth full bodied mouthfeel, but I have to admitted, the body seems lighter than last year, a little more airy.

Still a pleasant sipper, noticeably different from last year, namely cherries, berries and more pronounced vanilla, sweet caramel toffee, a soft char flavor and hints of oak wood, but in the end the woodiness really comes out and lingers in the palate, the alcohol is still light, and a rich sweet malty finish.

Very viscous and thick in body, but is a pale imitation to Bells Expedition in that category.  In the strict terms of a Bourbon Stout, I think that Schlaflys Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Stout is better.  This packs a lot of flavor but misses the mark in aroma and bourbony goodness.","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"

Seriously pours like ink (or maybe thin tar?) and commands a staunch, mocha head after a small reverse-cascade. Powerful, whiskeyed aroma over sweet chocolate syrup and caramel. And thats what gets delivered in the flavor... a dumptruck of chocolate/caramel candy over a heady, bourbon backdrop that heats the belly and singes the tongue. Over-roasted coffee joins the finish. Extremely full-bodied (almost chokingly so), and the flavor lasts and lasts. I like Greg Halls comment about there not being a cigar that could stand up to BCS, but I think an Acid Kuba Kuba would hold its own just fine. Oh, what a killer beer this is... totally worth its high price tag. And it really makes me wish I was back at <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Events-Detail.asp?Eve (sniffle)...

The flavor is quite sweet with coffee, chocolate, and a bitter finish.  The alcohol is well concealed.  A very fine effort - I look forward to trying it again after a bit more time to age.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","DMRz"
3451,"2007-03-07",4.2,"2006 bottle.  Super thick black motor-oil pourwith no head.  Rousing gives a thin dark tan head.  The aroma is oak, bourbon, toffee, and chocolate.  The bourbon aroma is unique in that it isnt caustic, but softer somehow.  A nice dark chocolate aroma helps, too.  The mouthfeel is viscous and silky.  Sharp bourbon notes begin the taste, and thats pretty much what dominates from there, safe for some chocolately tones underneath.  Warmth from the alcohol is there too, but it isnt overbearing.  Bet this would age pretty good.","Florida, USA","JMFG"

3451,"2007-02-22",4.3,"2006. 12 oz. Holy crap. What an aroma! The smells bowl me over as they race out of the glass. A nonstop cascade of fresh almond paste in a buttery croissant, a slab of hazlenut chocolate spread, blended with fig paste, reduced bourbon and brown sugar over aged mint leaves and a black tea. Dense, sweet and cold creamed. Amazing. This is how all Imp Stouts should smell. A love the deep dark fruits and nut characters, shys away from coffee, char and roast and ebbs towards the real caramelized malt notes. Beautiful. Pours pitch black, with a ruby sienna fringe and a light slick of tan head. Flavors are as bold and complex of the tongue. All the characters quickly invade every corner of my mouth. Theres reduced kumquat juice, mexican vanilla beans stripped and steeped in fresh cream, melding with english toffee, belgian truffles, and a mouthful of espresso beans. So bright and full of character. Theres a great percolation and prickly carbonation that keeps the beer alive on my tongue. In the middle the barrel and its alcohols shine in brilliant glory with a ruby fire of passion. Oaky nibs chime in with a faint quaf of parching air and then ebb out towards a charred sensation, with bristling charcoals, seared honey-crusted lamb bones, and toasted nuts. Finally, the deal is sealed with a torch of lemon candy, that reminds me that hops are in this potent brew. Mouthfeel is dense, with coarse grainy sugars and a whole lot of sweetness interplaying with the barrel alcohols. Heat is noticeable in a brandy sense, with coursing vinous behavior, but its not upsetting. A little light on the cold cream density texture that I desire, but the individual characters are accessible and well-defined making it well done. Refined. To me, a benchmark barrel-aged Imperial Stout.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

2/19/2007:  Ive been sick, so it has been 9 days since Ive had a beer.  Im finally feeling better now, so its time to end the beer drought!  Since it has been so long, I decided that I couldnt just settle for any beer.  It had to be something big and bold.  Good thing I already had a bottle of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout in the fridge...  BCS pours out a viscous, near black color.  It looks black as night in the glass with a deep mahogany color peaking out around the edges when held up to the light.  This beer is obviously thick.  After the pour, a small head eventually forms as the tiny carbonation bubbles slowly slither upward to the surface.  In addition, the beer leaves a brown, oily sheen on the inside surfaces of the glass (first time Ive seen this before!).  Charred wood, smoked meat, vanilla, and lots of bourbon are present in the complex and inviting aroma.  The flavor is rich, deep, and complex.  It begins with roasted malt and bourbon with a smoked, meaty quality.  The alcohol is warming and a very nice semi-sweet chocolate flavor with some coffee notes emerge in the finish.  Subsequent drinks reveal more and more chocolate flavor up front and throughout (slightly sweeter too), accompanied by some bourbon, charred wood, and roasted malt flavors.  The finish is slightly more dry with some caramel and cocoa flavors at the very end.  The bourbon flavor is well incorporated, balanced, and complements everything else in this beer very well.  The alcohol is apparent, but also well balanced, nicely integrated, and fits in nicely with the overall character of this beer.  BCS is full bodied and thick as cream, yet smooth and silky at the same time.  It has a wonderful oily characteristic that coats the entire mouth and tongue so that the wonderful flavors linger on and one for quite some time.  Overall this is an amazing stout and an absolute pleasure to drink.  I love bourbon and this beer showcases the bourbon decorously without overshadowing the other aromas and flavors of the beer too much.  A true delicacy...

2006 Vintage
11/21/2009:  Bourbon County Stout...  Aroma:  Popped the cap and bourbon immediately wafts from the bottle!  The aroma makes my mouth water:  TONS of caramelized malt; barrel char; licorice, toffee, maybe even a little high quality soy sauce...  Appearance:  Viscous and opaque black pour; no head, crown, or other foam on the surface; very little carbonation left.  Flavor:  Complex blend of bourbon, caramelized malts; toffee, dark chocolate, licorice, vanilla bean; nice alcohol burn through the nostrils; some alcohol-soaked woodiness in the finish; semi-sweet overall with bitterness like that of dark chocolate.  Palate:  Thick and full-bodied; smooth and mellow; creamy texture.  Overall:  This beer has aged beautifully; the usual initial hotness is gone and the complexities have melded into a homogeneous delicacy!  However, this beer is probably at its peak 6 months to 1.5 years from its release date.  Regardless, its still damn good right now!

What this beer did on first taste was remarkable considering how most beers first taste leave an impression that is usually one-sided. This brought about 5 different emotions in my tatse buds. First was the cold imperial""coffee"" stout taste followed by the bite on this in the early drinking stages, followed by the vanilla, oak flavor being a little strong at first, followed by the smokiness lingering, and lastly the great palate that this beer has.

Just about no head as it settles in the glass, but the head that existed was a light brown in color.  No lacing was left by this super dark brown opaque stout.  Filled the nostrils with an intense super malt scent with notes of wood and smoke enhancing the rich blend.  Poweful as it hits the tongue letting it all out a resinous body conveys evident smoky connotations reminiscent of burnt toast, you can sense the time this beer spent in the barrel in the wood and bourbon notes but it takes a very complimentary backstage to the overall power of malty goodness.

This one certainly delivers there, falling short only of Bells Expedition and Batch 7000 in mouthfeel. The degree to which the bourbon accents the beer is very nice too, letting the beer itself do the speaking and merely playing a crescendo on the taste.

3451,"2007-01-17",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2008 From a 12oz Bottle.  Pitch black, viscous oil slick of a pour with a thin layer of quickly dissipating roasted brown head.  A vigorous swirl brings some head back to life.  Dark fruity characters of rich prune and raisin pour out the top of my snifter glass, backed by a bold, yet balanced, oaky caramel bourbon character.  Some dark chocolatey fudge, soy dipped freshly baked pretzel, and a splash of vanilla also add some delicious complexity to this exquisite bouquet.  Full bodied, chewy mouthfeel with a silky soft chocolatey texture.  The flavors start out with a decadent serving of dark chocolate fondue, drizzled with a rich, creamy caramel glaze.  Notes of prune and raisin add a glorious, yet subtle fruity malt character.  As the fruits rest lazily on the palate, a warming wave of caramel vanilla bourbon notes begin to take over on the tongue, along with a bit of saltiness.  Before the alcohol notes begin to get too strong and unwelcome, they let off, slowly fading into the background to reveal some drier, chocolate roast coffee flavors that have been waiting patiently in the background.  A hint of anise is left lingering in the final smack.  The flavors of this beer are delcious, but incredibly overpowering, so much that a 12oz bottle is a tall order to consume by myself.  If this beer came in a nip bottle, my rating would be even slightly higher for a slightly easier drinkability.  Intense and over the top, but a sinfully delicious after dinner treat all the same.

3451,"2007-01-01",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2008 12oz, bottled 7/14/06. 5 1/2 months old now. pours pitch black, head is minimal but with some vigerous stirring i got a nice red velvet and tan head. looked amazing next to the pitch black stout. too bad it didnt last long and half way through the beer theres no head at all.  nose is quite bourbony with wonderful notes of vanilla, oak, burned espresso, and chocolate. one of the best aromas ive smelled. this beer is pretty hot. i feel the alcohol in the back of my throat. this has to be more than 11% cuz it tastes like 13+. tastes is very bourbony, vanilla, oaky, with undertones of dark fruits, chocolate, and coffee. mouthfeel isnt very full but is very smooth. very complex and delicious. loses palate points for how hot it is. cant wait to see this with a few years on it.9/4/8/3/16=4.0. 

okay so sometimes you sample a beer and it blows you away only to not have the same experience when you go back to it. well this is a rating from an almost 1 year cellar aged 06 bottle...wow. no more strong alc and bourbon in the nose, flavor and finish! nose is rich chocolate, oak, coconut, and bourbon. flavor is an extremely rich and complex array of the same, lots of toffee, coconut, oak, oh wow this is amazing, has aged so well it was once so hot but no more! this is aging better than other vintages. wow this is getting close to oak aged dark lord. 9/4/9/4/18=4.4. 
 

so I went back and tried another bottle and it wasnt like that one. more alcohol in this one and didnt have the depth and complexity along with less coconut. 9/4/8/4/17=4.2  

11/3/07, vertical with 1/05, 8/05, 7/06, and 10/07 vintages. I rank the vertical from best to worst: 1/05, 7/06, 10/07, and 8/05. The 1/05 batch has aged wonderfully, and it seemed the smoothest and richest. 7/06 batch is doing nicely but needs some more time as it is still a little harsh around the edges. 10/07 is just too fresh, clearly needs more time as it seems too raisiny and alcoholy. Im not sure what happened to the 8/05 batch as the nose didnt have much at all and the flavor lacked any chocolate presence, just alcohol, soy, and charred wood. this also had a fizzy mouth feel. interesting vertical, really dissapointed with the 8/05 bottle but BCS could have long aging potential. 

12/1/07, sampled another 8/05 bottle. tasty stuff still but mostly bourbon notes coming through. not much aged noticed, appears pretty mellow. alcohol noticed in the nose when it warms. probably the weakest vintage of BCS and Im not sure its going anywhere with more age. 3.8.

2/05/08, July 2006 batch, aged 17months. pours extremely thick and pitch black with no head. i dont recall seeing this be so thick before. aroma is soft buttery bourbon oak and dark fruits. flavor has a dark chocolate mixing with big oaky bourbon notes while some alcohol and dark fruits finish it out. body is thick and finish is silky smooth. aging really well.8/4/8/5/17=4.2.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

It is much lighter than the wonderfully delicious tastes of chocolate, roasted fruit, and malt.  The finish contains cherry, bourbon, and oak.  If you have ever made a fire of only oak wood, the smell and taste will be delightfully familiar and is very well integrated.

3451,"2006-12-27",4.2,"This one surprised me quite a bit considering I was expecting a bourbon bomb.  Pours thick and oily black with a dark brown head.  The aroma has heavily roasted malt, milk chocolate, vanilla, traces of bourbon and cream - very hearty and full.  Thick and full bodied that is rich and velvety with a small amount of carbonation.  The taste starts with a load of very roasted chocolate malt, vanilla, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, dark fruits, anise - there is a lot going on here.  The finish has a heck of an alcohol kick, but it words for this big beer.  There is bourbon in the flavor, but it is not in the forefront as with many, it is more of a supporting role.  Very well done imperial stout.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
3451,"2006-12-24",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2008 After trying for quite some time to acquire this beauty, I finally managed to get 2 4-packs from my mom for the holidays.  If this is worth half the hype it will be worth it.  2006 bottle.  Pours as black as Ive ever seen with barely any head.  Temperature starting out around 50F.  Aroma  is a masterful mix of oak, vanilla, butter & thick cream, alcohol, with some chocolate & coffee.  Taste is a thick mixture of chocolate, cream, wood, vanilla, and several others that I cant even distinguish yet.  This is an amazingly thick & tasty roller coaster ride of a beer!  My only complaint is that its a ""tad"" hot, but that is to be expected since its only a few months old.  Im excited to try this one as it ages!

2/10/2008:  Couldnt help myself - had to try one of my 2007 bottles.  Wow - this is intense.  I definitely prefer an older bottle that has cooled off a bit, but this one is still packed with intense aroma and taste.  Bourbon-woodiness is very prominent and quite tasty.

You can tell in the pour that this is going to be a monster of a brew.  Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, molasses and some caramel.  The taste is amazing with bourbon, vanilla, charred oak, smoke, some mild fruitiness and caramel malt.  The bourbon plays an important role but isnt dominating as some other ""bourbon enhanced"" beers.  Instead it plays very nice making this a memorable stout.  The mouthfeel on this is very creamy but also a bit oily.  Their is a slight alcohol burn in the finish but aside from that its very well hidden.

After picking this up during the summer and trading one away, I thought I would give it a try.  The next batch is out and I wanted to know if it was worth picking up again.  After having it, I have to say not.  I may sit on the remaining two bottles for a while to see if they calm down but this was one hot beer.  Still, even an average imperial stout is better than most other beers.
Aroma / Appearance - The nose was a nice texture of oak, vanilla, plums, cocoa and smoke.  Further investigation revealed chestnuts, mocha and caramel.  It was a little thin for a Top 50 imperial stout but still quite complex and enojyable.  The pour was deep black with the thinnest of mocha colored heads.  The lacing left remnants all the way to the end of the glass, leaving traces of the level as it dropped.
Flavor / Palate - Plums, raisins, anise, smoke and a huge bourbon note infused my mouth.  There was a trace of coffee after everything but the bourbon faded.  It was a hot ride for a while probably due to the aging in bourbon barrels.  Towards the middle of glass, as it warmed, I detected caramel, hazelnut and a vinous mouthfeel.  At the end it took on chocolately tones.  Overall it was extremely tasteful but the bourbon was just too overwhelming.  Unlike some bourbon barrel aged stouts where it highlights existing flavors, this one supresses and dominates.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Taste is the same with some molasses and vanilla. This is the best oak/bourban berrel beer i have had to date. I typically despise them.

12oz 06 bottle. This is by far the darkest beer I have ever poured. The flavor and aroma was pungent and wonderful.

A 12 oz bottle was pours into a few Snifter glasses thanks to acertain (once again!!).  This brew pours an intense dark black color with almost no head, but what is there is quite beigey tan.  The nose on this brings a blast of oak woody bourbon, dark roasty malts, and hinting on caramel and smokeyness.  The flavor then brings an onslaught to the palate starting off with a very roasted and dark malt mixed with vanilla moving into a caramely sweetness with smoke, and finally ending in a beautifully done thick molasses and bourbon oaked alcohol finish.  VERY full bodied and intense on the tongue.  Little to no carbonation.  The bourbon is hinted at through the whole taste, but is mainly present near the finish.

That being said it was Very Very good beer. But it was 18.99 for a 4 pack. Im gonna age the other 3 for a few years and see if they can improve to the point of being better than the other stouts I mentioned. It is black with a chocolate brown tiny head. Mildly carbonated. The smell but not really flavor of burbon is mildly there. It has more of a toasty chocolaty essence to it, with some bitterness. Its overall a good imperial stout.

3451,"2006-12-02",4.4,"Even though I balked at paying 7.50 for this in a store, I had no problem forking over 12 in a bar go figure.  Thick pitch black beer with dark brown head fading to lace.  Aroma is very sweet and malty, dark heavy salty roastiness.  Soy character along with all of the sweetness.  Warming brings out the sweet bourbon and vanilla character.  Dried plums and prunes.  Charcoal smokiness and lots of heavy bitter dark chocolate.  Soft tobacco herbal character as well.  Very complex nose.  Flavour is just as impressive, dominated by dark chocolate and heavy roast, there are also notes of smoke, soy, charred oak, followed by soft vanilla and bourbon on the finish.  Bitterness is quite herbal and quite assertive, combining with all of the roast to keep the sweetness in check.  Lovely brew, bourbon doesnt dominate, but just adds background complexity to a beer that would have been excellent anyway.

The flavor though, contains all the elements of a great Imperial Stout, and in great form. The initial sip revealed many notes of coffee, bourbon of course, vanilla, smokiness, oak, and sweet malts. All of these flavors linger on the palate for quite some time. This is a wonderful creation.","Sevierville, Tennessee, USA","muenster"
3451,"2006-12-01",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 22, 2007 Bottle, big thanks to Muenster for sharing this beauty. The pour is very black with no real head other than a dark tan ring on the top. Lacing on the goblet is thick. Im slightly let down by the aroma. My expectations for this are very high and the nose seems a little one dimensional. It smells good indeed, but its little more than sweet bourbon with a touch of coffee behind it. Ive sampled a few other bourbon-aged brews with a comperable nose. Now, the mouth is where this gem really shines. The flavor is absolutely savory. More espresso, brownies, smoke, and dense, black chocolate come out and intertwine with the sweet vanilla, oak, bourbon notes. The viscous liquid is coating and the whole delivery just sticks to my mouth and lingers for minutes on a savory note of coffee ice cream, bourbon, and a nice cigar. This is a gigantic beer with tremendous depth and balance.

[Nov 22, 2007]=------- 2006 bottle sent my way by the generosity of Iowaherkeye. I was so blown away by this one that I had to get another bottle. The pour is darker than I remember. Its almost ebony with a small dark tan head. Lacing is dense on the snifter. The aroma is quite rich with deeper complexity than I recall. Yes, the bourbon is laid on thick, but many subtle nuances one finds in a good glass of southern whisky are imparted here: vanilla, smoke, charred oak, all with a chocolaty and roasty background. The mouthfeel is pretty dense and highlights the savory sweet flavors of brownies, vanilla, soft smoke, and coffee. The alcohol warms up my nostrils a bit while I sip this beast. Yknow, this is a very, very good beer. Its not as complex or refined as I recall and the bourbon character is much stronger, perhaps the 3 year old bottle I first sampled actually benefited from the age. This is a pretty straightforward ""barrel aged imperial stout,"" but it is done so well. While no surprises are found here, this is quite solid. My score reflects the 2006 bottle.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Aromas of brisket, caramel apples, campfire smoke and the inside of the bourbon bottle fill the room.  The flavors are rich and intense, of guatemalan coffee, turtle cake, sticky caramel rolls and many full swallows of bourbon.

3451,"2006-11-12",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2006 immediately the best beer ive ever had out of a twist-off.  couldnt help but laugh, the aroma immediately reminds me of the FoBAB last weekend.  pretty perfect pour. very thick, black with light penetrating only the top, producing deep browns.  head is similarly thick deep coffee-bean brown. hard to judge aroma after that festival.  bourbon dominates the aroma, easily.  i gather a nice meld of vanilla, chocolate and caramel complementing it... wow, really hot.  even at reasonably cool temperature, alcohol very strong. some surprising cola flavor. not very bitter, not very sweet, both kinda surprising. a bit later im still surprised at how how little coffee there is and how much more chocolate/vanilla syrup it is.  no shortage on flavor, but not quite what you expect in a big impy.  the oak is a no-brainer. salty. full body, sticky, really hot finish.  crazy to say this, but tastes like it would be closer to mephistopheles-levels of alcohol.  bummer, i would have loved to have given this a much higher score.  will lay down and rerate.","chicago, Illinois, USA","sersdf"

Smells like bourbon, oak, alcohol, brown sugar, dark fruit, anise (no chocolate or coffee in there for me, a surprise).  Nice flavor, lots of coffee and chocolate, vinous, almost has a chocolate liqour taste to it.  Complex but not.  Hugely thick mouthfeel, kind of like herseys chocolate syrup, but I like that right now...  Overall, super dry, super rich, and lots of chocolate flavor.  Bourbon in the aroma is nice, but the alcohol is a little too much.  Still, I love stouts, and I love bourbon, so I have trouble giving this bad ratings.  Great carbonation for a barrel aged beer too.  I like it, not everyday, but its worth having.  Rerate... interesting beer.  Lots of malt in the aroma.  I still like this beer.

3451,"2006-11-05",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 29, 2008 2006. Bourbon. Bourbon. Bourbon. With a hint of stout. Aroma is more liqour than beer. The taste is the same. A hint of bourbon, whiskey, oak are fine but fundamentally I want to feel like Im drinking beer. This is overdone. And at $19.99 a six pack Im not going to work too hard to point out the upsides.

2007 Re-rate. Alright this one works for me- and very well. Still a lot of bourbon but an absolutely huge stout behind it wtih tobacco, leather, chocolate tones. The mouthfeel alone makes this worthwhile. There are also significant hops balancing the sweetness of the bourbon. Wonder if the 11% to 13% change also reflects a more substantial malt contribution. The key was also letting it warm for 15 minutes bfore taking the first sip.","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"

2007 Vintage 
A huge thanks to whoever provided this for the Cellars MN tasting!  I was wanting to try this after feeling last years vintage was too one dimensional with the bourbon taking over.  This years seem a little toned down on the bourbon (although still strong bourbon).  I thought this added to the experience and made this beer much more complex.  Well done.  I may have to get some of my own.

Bottle.  I have been trying to get my hands on this beer for quite some time now.  And it just happened to make its way into Minnesota.  Its not cheap at close to $5 a bottle.  A tan head forms and then disappears very quickly.  Then all that is left is a ring along the glass.  This has some of the strongest bourbon notes Ive ever encountered in a barrell aged beer.  Also strong molasses, raisin, plum, chocolate.  The bourbon flavor is a little strong for my liking, otherwise this is a very nice sipping brew.  So I would have to rate it slightly under world class, just because the bourbon is a tad too overpowering.  But if you like the bourbon sweetness and that is your thing, then youll love this beer.

3451,"2006-11-01",4.0,"2005 vintage.  Intense bourbon flavour, which I love, that leads to a wonderful vanilla character.  Heavy use of malt in this one to the point of being a bit too cloying on the palate.  A bit hot, but the intense sweetness helps to keep it in check.  Obviously a great one to age in your cellar for a couple years to meld the flavors together in a more complementary fashion.  I would say a good cigar beer as this would definately stand up to a nice robusto in maduro wrapper and would really bring the sweetness down a notch.  Ill definately have to try this and re-rate at a later point.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"
3451,"2006-10-31",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 28, 2010 12/28/10  Sure when you pop one of these fresh theyre pretty hot with alcohol and turn off a lot of people, but if you can hold on to these for two years like the one Im drinking now... wow, just wow.  Thin beige head around the rim  on top of pitch black syruppy beer.  Rich aged malts chocolate and bourbon balanced so well.  Lots of chocolate after a couple years as the bourbon character takes it place in proportion to the roast and chocolate.  Some dark fruits and oak underneath those dominant characters. Almost a little too sweet but the bourbon and roast turn these flavors into a sweet medley.  Just amazing.  The perfect aged imperial stout.

Ive had this beer so many times and havent rated it enough.  

10/31/06  Mini vertical with 8/05 and 7/06 newly released batch.  The new batch is in Heaven Hills barrels.  Pours a dark chocolate black with the thinnest ring of a head.  Bourbon nose pours off both glasses with a little bit of molasses, roastiness, vanilla and toffee.  The 05 has a more rounded nose where you can pick up more of the subtle aromas.  Nice slightly sticky medium thick mouthfeel with bourbon in the punch.  The 06 has the barrel earthiness with  molasses carmel vanilla and burnt roastedness.  It finishes hot with that bourbon numbing the tongue but for being only bottled a few months ago, this is pretty damn palatable.  
The 05 is smoother with age, and more stout like.  With that bourbon mellowed out a little or maybe the under flavors coming out more the chocolate, carmel, coffee and burnt roast this makes for a tasty beer.  It still finishes hot but not quite as hot as the 06.  That being said the 05 is better than the 06 now, but damn the 06 is gonna being really amazing in a couple years.  Its overall smooth and subtle earthy bourbon characteristics, make me look forward to sitting around a fire this cold winter with this fire in my glass and throat.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"

This is 08/05 release, so this is working on a little more than a year.  So I have had many bourbon beers, and this one is slightly disappointing to me.  Sure, its got the huge bourbon flavor and finish, but it doesnt have the nice balance and its so overwhelming flavors of bourbon that it is almost sickening to my stomach.  Nose has some vanilla, chocolate, and coffee, but a large amount of alcohol.  Taste is similar, with a huge burning sensation from the alcohol.  I hear this beer is 20 dollars for 4, which is 5 dollars a whack, which it is not worth at all.  This would be ok, if it wasnt so hot.

The nose is huge; the bourbon aroma is well-balanced by the toastiness of the oak and vanilla; alcohol is somewhat apparent, but still incredibly appetizing.  Full, viscous mouthfeel, hitting every corner of the tongue: fine bourbon (with the slightest hints of sour-mash character), sweet vanilla and oak and chocolate and charred malt; and even a salty, bitter edge that brings in one further dimension.  Thick, layered palette; bourbon, chocolate, and a toasty character in a medium finish.  Very enjoyable.  Now to test Greg Halls cigar theory...","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
3451,"2006-09-24",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2009 Rating 500. Bottles shared at acertains gathering. 
 
Pours a deep black with red-brown highlights. The aroma offers surprisingly rich notes of sweet raisin in addition to the expected bourbon, oak, and chocolate. The flavor leads with dark fruit and vanilla bourbon, with French roast coffee coming in underneath and penetrating sweetness throughout.  Im left with a long-lingering, alcoholic, vanilla extract fniish. Unfortunately, the mouthfeel, while certainly full, l is very hot on the tongue; this is my biggest criticism of the beer. 

This is certainly a high-end beer. I didnt enjoy it as much as I recall enjoying the Full Sail Black Gold, but it was certainly superb and I am very glad to have had the chance to try it. Thank you, acertain!

Big wood and alcohol followed by layers, layers, layers: vanilla & pumpkin, bourbon for sure, plenty of smoke, prune and caramel sweetness, and of course chocolate and toast.

Currants, alefruit, and some bittersweet chocolate all get crushed underneath astringent oak tannins and palate destroying bourbon and fusel alcohol.  High alcohol heat in the finish, tapers to reveal some caramel and toastiness.

Bourbon (surprise), carmel. Sweet carmel flavor, kind of sticky, a little roast, a little bit of resiny hops, vanilla ice cream. Soft full palate with just a touch of astringency. Id kind of like to taste this stout sans barrel. It has elements that are really very good, but it cant seem to make them cohesive, and the oak isnt helping, especially in the aroma.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"
3451,"2006-04-24",4.3,"Thanks to kmpitz2 & TAR for this...
Appears black with a bubbly 2 finger tan head that quickly fades into a small collar. No lacing is left behind that there is little head retention.
Smell is of subdued candied bourbon & American oak & rich caramel vanilla, bitter chocolate, raisins melted into a rich, sugary syrup, and perhaps a rich cherimoya sorbet in there as well. Obviously complex!
Taste is of the same aromas...left in the barrel just the right amount of time.
Mouthfeel is chewy, caramely sweet, smooth, slightly fizzy on the swallow with an alcohol burn. The ABV is evident before it even reaches the mouth. It almost burns the eyes as the glass approaches the nose and mouth.
Drinkability is very candy like and addictive with intense flavors. ABV is there but it is very delicious. One bottle is enough to do the job for the night. Savor every last drop of this!","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"

Nose is of what else but bourbon, vanilla, caramel, mollases, a little coffee, and American oak. One drink and you can tell this beer is something different, something big, and something special. Enormous amounts of wood but in a very good way adding complexity too the brew. Prune, dark unsweetened choclate, mollases, pure vanilla extract, and alcohol glide across the palate in a race for the most complex brew award. This is a very big, very masculine beer.

Aroma of bourbon is quite powering as well as some chocolate and vanilla. Taste is a mix between some chocolate malt with hints of vanilla, coffee and oak. Bourbon presence is interesting but a bit too powerful for my liking since it brings too much alcohol, which is not something that I necessarily enjoy. Body is full and has a creamy texture, which I quite enjoy. Overall, this is a very interesting creation, which Im glad, got a chance to try but I feel I would probably prefer the non-barrel aged version more.

3451,"2006-03-30",4.8,"On the first sip, I was seriously worried this might supplant my long-running all-time favorite beer!

Poured a rich, velvety black. So thick the surface didnt ripple under a pour, it *folded* in waves. Dark brown head was a little difficult to coax out, and slowly disappeared. No real lacing, but this stuff is so thick that sheets of the beer itself lace the glass when tipped.

This stuff smells heavily of vanilla, bourbon, and oak. A thick, sweet smell.

This stuff is just double-stout heaven! Intensely complex. Starts as an espresso double-roast, and instantly turns into an explosion of vanilla, oak, and roast. Slowly fades into a bloom of grapefruit-like hops that stay with you. Each sip brings out more flavors than the last.

This stuff is thick, and massive. Just barely enough carbonation to keep it from intimidating your tongue into hiding. If only all stouts could be so!

I have to be careful, as this is the only bottle Ive ever had, and this stuff isnt sold locally for me. Once its gone, its gone. I think I just may weep when I finish this glass.","Bainbridge Island, Washington, USA","waldowin"

This isnt something youd drink several pints of - okay, I wouldnt - but its smooth and relaxing, creamy, thick, syrupy and mildly lively with alcohol and a sweet woody palate.

Aromas of nuts, coconut, fresh cut firewood & a feeling of hot alcohol.  Bourbon.  Drinks full w/ a burning and burnt finish.  Lotsa wood barrel flavor and not much stout flavor.  Coffee roast flavor comes through & some chocolate, bitter chocolate.  I once shared a bottle of this w/ matt & pat(both lovers of bourbon).  We decided that the best way to drink this beer was to pour it into shot glasses and shoot it(well, I sipped mine) Otherwise it is just too intense.  Ive always thought shots were done so you didnt have to taste what you were drinking...otherwise you wouldnt be able to swallow it.  They both had troubles drinking this the way one usually drinks beer.  Bourbon barrel aged beer just doesnt do it for me.  Im increasingly interested in nuance and grace.  This beer is rough, rugged, crude, lacking any subtlety.  Instead, it has tons of everything blasting at me like the guy who parks outside and cranks his bass so obnoixiously loud I wonder what sort of enjoyment that could be giving him.  This blast seems to be masquerading as complexity, when really its just overkill, chaos & disaster.  OK, Im exaggerating a bit here.  Is this beer simply a reflection of American culture?  Mass(ive) Media...everywhere you look things blasting at you from all directions...tvs, radios, cell phones, dvd players in your car, ipods, billboards, junkmail, junk email, banner ads, pop-ups, special promotions....the hottest new thing!  The biggest and the best.  500 horsepower, just be careful, old man, not to crash into that gas pump as you pull that caddy out...maybe that car has too much power for you?

All the commentators kept saying how ""absolutely insane"" it was there while the cameras showed shoots of thousands of people standing around staring at a ball.  ""its mayhem"" one said.  Yeah.

The head, like all other matter, cannot survive the solubilizing excesses of the ethanol solvent. It smells exactly like dark malt extract BEFORE you dilute it to brew up a homebrew stout. It almost pours as thick as well. The sweetness is beyond sweet, but the alcohol burn needs it. Im afraid this beer is fixing my innards. God, but it is a great way to die! Coffee, honey, chocolate, molasses all abound, but the killer aroma and flavor is BOURBON. If you took the Rogue Chocolate Stout, fed it steroids for a year , and then locked it away in a Bardstown distillery until it was old enough to drive, this is the monster you would have created.

2006 Version:
The aroma in this is primarily filled with bourbon, more so than I remember in last years version. There is some chocolate, oak and even a hint of vanilla hidden in there. The flavour is very strongly bourbon based and silky notes of vanilla, oka, and chocolate tumble in. There is a bit of an alcoholic bite at the end as well. I think last years version was a bit better as this is so alcoholic. Its still a well crafted and tasty beer, however.

3451,"2006-01-22",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2006 Very thick pour with a nice dark tan head...opaque to say the least. Vanilla and bourbon are coming to the nose, while bourbon, vanilla, and caramel are in the flavor of this intense stout. Malty to bitter on the tongue, but malty certainly takes the majority. Smooth, silky, rich...awesome dessert/night cap beer. Careful though, the alcohol is hidden very well, and if not taken in moderation...this beer will knock you on your ass. What I find impressive as well is the absence of chocolate and/or coffee in the flavor, which usually is present in most imperial stouts Ive comsumed.

Update:12/12/2006 from last years batch
The bourbon elements still remain dominant in both the aroma and the flavor. Chocolate and some light coffee are present as well as some vinous elements in the flavor...but they are pretty slight. SMooth and slightly grainy mouthfeel...roasty, bittersweet, boozey finish. Still fairly hot...certainly something for someone who loves bourbon. I was totally off with the absence of chocolate and coffee...its in there. Great stuff, though Im still miffed that GI stiffed Ohio on this stuff this year.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"

3451,"2006-01-19",4.5,"Bottle from 8/16/2005.  I dont think I poured this one very well; I just got a hint of head, and the bubbles were very short-lived.  The aroma: what can I say?  Bourbon.  Other things are there, but the bourbon dominates everything.  It would have been a 9 or 10 had it been better balanced.  In the mouth it is rich and creamy; just what Im looking for in a rich stout.  Once it got in my mouth, the other aromas really came out, and the bourbon receded to where it was very balanced.  Vanilla and chocolate come to the forefront, still with echos of the bourbon.  In my opinion, an amazing stout, and my first 10 for flavor.

3451,"2006-01-16",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2007 Black with a dark brown head that diminished quickly. Aroma is bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, and caramel with very woody tones. Kind of reminds me of a toned down Sam Adams triple bock. Silky mouthfeel. Flavor is sweet chocolate, vanilla, sweet bread, and some roasted. The alcohol is present with a little bourbon flavor to it. HIghly sweet beer. The aftertaste is a sweet nuttiness. The chocolate is very faint in a flavor dominated by darker fruits like raisins. Has a warming finish courtesy of the alcohol.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","eboats"

Raisins and dark chocolate are there as well but are thrown under the bus as this beers barrel aged flavor is overpowering.  Its a huge dark beer and I usually like that but I feel this brew accentuates more the flavors that I am least fond of in an Imperial Stout rather than the ones I love.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","entertheiceman"
3451,"2006-01-15",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2008 Bottle dated 8-16-05 .  Pours very dark brown, opaque in the glass.  Aroma of alcohol, some wood, and a little bit of chocolate.  Flavor is mostly alcohol heat, wood and again, just a bit of chocolate.  Theres far too much alcohol flavor to be enjoyable.  Not very complex, and really just not that good.

Bottle dated 8-16-05.  Couldnt wait til 2010.  Drinking 3-9-08.  What a difference 2 1/2 years can make.  Aroma is good, no alcohol, oak, some fruity/cherry is present.

Seems like it has come together pretty well, definitely better than it was.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","temporrari"

Big roasted malts and a great cinnemon role and molasses aroma sitting above a wiskey influenced character.  Distinct and unique aroma.  Really strong alcohol flavors are initially border on obscene.  They are sharp, oakey, and seem to finish sweet until a quick hit of alcohol again appears.  It becomes more round and releases chocolate, coffee, molasses, and strong burbon tones.  It grows on me as I finish it, but I think it could be better with age.

The body was thick and heavy on the tounge, but thats to be expected...this is a huge beer, and certainly meant for sipping!  The flavor was very complex and almost overpowering to me.  Midpalate and late on the tounge is when I really noticed the bourbon flavor.  Just the aftertase on this thing is stronger than some brews actual flavor!

Very dark brown pour. Thin, fizzy brown head, dissipates fast into a small thin ring. Rich aroma of chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, alcohol, roasted malt, some faint dark fruit. 
Rich vanilla laden chocolate followed quickly by a slightly off-balanced amount of bourbony alcohol. Further inspection yields bourbon flavored fruit, some faint roasted coffee.  I want to say it is unbalanced... but then again, it is good. Nicked the palate a bit for that. But regardless, its really easy to get over the bourbon. This thing is really chewy, has a good overall sweetness + some roasted malts to balance it out a bit. I like it.

Medium bodied with a creamy, smooth texture that starts with complex flavors of dried fruit (raisin and prune), caramel, and light sweet malt flavors.

3451,"2005-10-10",4.3,"09.29.05  GABF  Why in the world did they have the bottles of this stuff buried in a tub of ice?  Well, its black as can be, even in the tiny GABF tasting cup, and I get little to zero head on the multiple pours.  Great nose melds bourbon and oak nicely with chocolate and tobacco.  I dont get the smoke notes that many talked about, but there seems to be a dry, earthy quality to it that could be the wood or could be the barrels pitch.  Either way, its complimentary and nice.  A sure bitterness pervades mixing bitter roast and woody hops.  Long and roasty finish could be more bitter, but theres a sweet coating, like the exhale of a flavored pipe tobacco.  Very nice.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
3451,"2005-10-10",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2006 This beer is a pitch black color, with hardly any head created by the gentle pouring of this beer into a tulip glass.  The aroma is rich with notes of Bourbon, vanilla, a strong oak character, and woody tannins.  The aroma is very appealing with a liquor-like alcohol note to it as well.  The taste is quite thick, definitely a dessert, rich malt character that is dominated by the oak contributions; Bourbon, vanillin, and a slight tannic oakiness, and a definite buttery oak note.  There are notes of coffee and roast malt here, but the rich buttery oak character dominates the palate.  This beer is so rich and full, really a meal in a glass, it took me a while to chew my way through this beer, which was perfect for my last beer of the night.

3451,"2005-10-10",4.6,"2003 bottle that was almost filled to the top: Opaque, black, black as black gets.  Little viscosity when swirled (probably due to the high alcohol content) and no head or lacing...odd.  There is just a little brown ring of foam after pouring.  Aroma is stellar:  American oak (sweet, body enhancing, vanilla, charred wood, and ice cream), caramel, alcohol, coffee with cream, overripe cheese rind, and dark fruit. Flavor is amazing as well: Although there is quite a difference between the aroma and flavor, the flavor is like fine, vintage, well-aged port served at the perfect time in a meal.  The sugar level is right, the roast is right (not overdone), the alcohol is perfect (no burn), the viscosity is right (not too fat), it sits properly on the tongue, and the palate is perfect.  11% and this is well balanced.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","AlchemistZ"

3451,"2005-09-27",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2013 Black with burgundy edges. Nose was of chocolate cake and brownies. Silky texture. Rich, toasty, strong and intense flavors. Fudge played out in my mind. Lesser notes of whiskey and vanilla-laden oak, with rich chocolate. Some sourness and wood in the background. Mellow bourbon as well. Overall, I found it rich, sweet, chewy and warming.

Head is initially small, brown, mostly diminishing.

Full body, syrupy texture, soft carbonation, heavily alcoholic.

Woof...very burning and sweet and syrupy.  Not elegant at all, and difficult to drink more than a few sips.  Some good aspects in the nose, but its big, clumsy, and bruising; not how I prefer an Impy stout to be.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

3451,"2005-09-12",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 10, 2014 (1st batch, with a 3-7-4 indicated on the white label with typewriter inscription):Loads of bourbon greet the nostrils upon approach, surrounded by black grapes, roasted malts, and nagging soy...Thick molasses engulf the fruitiness and roastiness, giving you a lip-smacking sweet mouthfeel...Alcohol heat is definitely felt, but doesnt bother much...This is classy, well-brewed, yet nothing sets it apart from all those barrel-aged imperials...This was apparently the precursor though, you cant forget that...3.6/5

(Versions bottled on 010505 and 101207 were quite similar):A lot less soy sauce thankfully, thus roastier and more dessert-y that its ancestor...Alcohol is better controlled in the aroma, the bourbon being not as expressive, and less oppressive...Tons of residual sugar make a hefty mouthfeel presenting decadent molasses, toffee and vanilla...Alcohol burns in the end though, a firm reminder of its size...Overall, I have to say this is an intense sipper, and thus not very drinkable, but it remains quite harmonious despite its potency...3.9/5

A tap example at World of Beer in Charlotte (2014) confirms my first bottled impressions. This is a well-made, decadent dessert brew. But its too sugary and rich to be able to dwell with the masters of the style, in my book.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
3451,"2005-09-11",3.8,"01-05-05 batch. Considering its strength, the pour offers a generous dark brown head to cover the pitch black, completely opaque hue. Heavily malty aroma, spicy licorice and molasses paired along chocolate chips. It has that sweet dessert component that reminds me of chocolate cookies while the hops, mostly floral, pair nicely with the minty barrel character. Obvious alcohol presence peaks throughout the blackberry and grapey fruitiness, all in a tar like bold malt base. Port and Madeira reminding finish, very alcoholic, bubble gummy and strongly roasty (tobacco). Expert palate rounding, full bodied, soft in texture, intense mouth presence. Good stuff if not particularly my style.  We also had a bottle of the first batch in that tasting (typing machine text saying only bourbon county stout and 3-7-4 whether its a bottling number or date  Thanks TAR) and it was concentrating on the bourbon a decent bit more, leaving a perhaps even boozier and certainly less integrated product malt wise.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Bourbon steps up to the plate as well as some good chocolate notes. Oak and vanilla are there as well. Dissapointed with the flavor a bit. The EtOH is way too dominant. There is a strong presence of Bourbon which was to be expected. Chocolate is the next biggest player, mixed with some coconut. A tad too sweet yet as well.

Vanilla, honey, chocolate and coffee tones on the nose. Could be the best-smelling beer Ive ever raised to my sniffer. Pours solid black while the precious little carbonation forms a tiny tan head that quickly dissipates. Sweet honey & vanilla bean are prominent in the flavor, supported by roasted malt, hop bittering, a hint of licorice and a touch of charred wood. Small bit of raisin joins in the aftertaste. That tiny bit of carbonation does quite a dance on the tongue. I generally dont care for Goose Island products but this ones a home-run.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

3451,"2005-09-02",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 17, 2006 2005 bottle acquired in an awesome trade with Htsprint1.  Thanks so much Noah!  Shared with Eyedrinkale and Egajdzis on 8/27/2005.Pours a thick, viscous deep black, opaque, heavy looking substance, with a small, thick tan head, that is not long retained, little bit of legs on the glass.  Sediment on the bottom of the bottle.  Aroma of coconuts, sweet molasses and rich toffee.  Oaky and just very strong.  Touches of charred wood smoke is very dry in the nose and gives some balance to the sweet coconut, chocolate fudge, vanilla and light alcohol.  Being very underwhelmed by most Imperial Stouts I have tried lately, especially the barrel-aged ones, Ive got to say, I was incredibly impressed and refreshed by this one.  Granted this isnt a terribly refreshing beer, but it was just nice to see a unique imperial stout that dosent bludgeon you with hops or alcohol.  Even the roast is fairly restrained here, relatively speaking.  What you do get a lot of, is coconut, sweet vanilla beans and chocolate fudge, though a bit drier than all that sounds.  Rich, thick mouthfeel is borderline syrupy, and significantly malty sweet, but for me, it works.  Very viscous and oily, with a very low carbonation.  It goes down easy, on my palate, though.  The bourbon is somehow flavorul, moreso than it is drying or sharp.  Sweet chocolate-vanilla sticks with you, as some late hops grows as it warms.  Bourbony flavors are always present but dont really bother me, even at the end of the glass.  Very full body.  Love to get more of this stuff.Rerate  Or rather, resample, Im not changing my marks because this beer is maturing very nicely. At about a year old now, the bourbon is still under control, even moreso now, with a creamy/chocolatey texture without gobs of harsh roast or hops.  Smokiness and ashiness are controlled and used to balance, not overwhelm.  Awesome.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Massive, syrupy beer, with a strong vanilla growing as it warms and some complexity to the bourbon, without giving off quite the intensity of alcohol as you might expect (or would actually find in other beers of this abv).

Aroma was dominated by bourbon.. with oak, vanilla, smoke, and bittersweet chocolate undertones.  Flavor was heavy on the roasted malts and especially on the bourbon.  Somewhere deep down were some hops and chocolate.  Unfortunately, the balance seemed considerably out of whack.. the power of the bourbon just overpowered the other flavors, and made this a little hard to swallow.

Bottle (2007):  Outstanding aroma of chocolate, caramel, vanilla, bourbon, maple syrup, toffee, light alcohol, and very faint coffee.  This really has to be one of the best aromas for a beer.

There is a really good Imperial Stout in here, but the Bourbon is a bit too intense at this stage in its life for me.

3451,"2005-06-30",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 9, 2005 NEW RATING: Bottle into ale tasting glass.  I was wrong about this the first time I had it.  This is not over-rated.  My biggest complaint the first time I had it was that it smelled exactly like dog food.  While I still smell a little bit of it, especially right out of the bottle, its not dominating.  What is dominating is the utter balance of the smell; in equal parts, we have plumy dark chocolate, brown sugar, and a very fruity warm bourbon aroma.  Wonderful.  If it werent for the lingering dog food smell, this would be a 9 smell, potentially 10 (I really dont like the dog food).  Looks are a very high 4, almost 5.  This is maybe the darkest head Ive seen.  It produces a somewhat sticky lace wall, and the racing is fairly deep and slow.  Of course, the beer itself is triple distilled crude oil reduced and congealed, ie thick as all hell.  Its just as thick as it looks in the mouth, even thicker than melted chocolate.  The thickness is soft and velvety, and is really a unique experience (I dont remember Dark Lord or BA Speedway feeling like this; those are the only two that might match it).  You feel the alcohol numbing your face after half a glass, but you dont taste it.  The body of this thing absorbs everything.  The flavor starts as rich as the feel, very fruity with a bourbon character.  Yet, unlike many bourbon aged stouts, the bourbon here is in perfect balance; it is a complement, not the defining feature.  The bridge is a sweetish milk chocolate transitioning into the hoppy finish, which is roasty and moderately bitter.  Eventually, the finish rounds into a bakers cocoa dryness.  In sum, I have to say Im sorry for what I said before, Bourbon County.  Please forgive me.  ORIGINAL RATING: 3.6.  2005 bottle into small shaker, Hop Leaf, Chicago IL.  After checking a couple bottle shops for this and not finding it, I was happy to see it at Hop Leaf.  Maybe the scarcity is why they are charging $10 a bottle.  I was drinking it with some non-beer geek friends who werent that into it.  My buddy Vivek said, ""Oh, that smells like ass.  Like a fat ass,"" whatever that means.  I thought it smelled like dog food fresh from the bag, with some bourbon underneath and a teeny bit of vanilla bean.  The dog food smell went away as the beer warmed, or maybe because I got used to it, but the first impression was negative.  Inky black in the glass with a medium brown fizzy head that doesnt last long.  Feels full as hell and oily with noticable alcohol.  Dry roast in the finish with a bourbon tang.  Middle is sweet with some liquid chocolate (of both the milk and semi-sweet variety), but the flavors get consumed by the massiveness of the body.  The bourbon is at a nice level, almost too much but definitely not; I think they found the inflection point.  This had me thinking the whole way through that Goose Island was trying to make a Dark Lord clone.  The size was impressive, and considering it the balance was impressive too (with semi-dry hops on the end and the roast drying it out a bit), but none of the elements jumped out as objectively dope.  If this were present at The Friday, it probably would have been somewhere just below the top 20 in my book, but I can see how some would fall in love with it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"
3451,"2005-06-28",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2009 Another 05 vintage bottle drank in late 2009, this beer is holding up beautifully, all the complexity is still there and it is a little smoother to drink. Just stupendous. Thanks to Duane for the bottle. Bottled January 5, 2005. Poured a black that seem almost purple somehow. The head is a dark tan color that is almost orange. The aroma is massive. Rich with toffee and fresh chocolate chip cookies. The vanilla from the barrel aging is there with just enough of a hint of oak to make this interesting. The barrel aging does not dominate, but rather accentuates the already awesome aroma. If you breathe in deeply you do get a whiff of this high abv monster. Wow, the taste is incredible. Cocoa and some Bananas Foster at first. A little bit of very high quality espresso and some very rich caramel. The mouthfeel is slightly sticky. A hint of alcohol in the finish, but it is not detracting in any way. I imagine this beer will continue to age magnificently. Tried another bottle from August 16th, 2005 in December of 2005.

3451,"2005-06-26",4.6,"(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with footbalm, thanks Eric!) Well, this is it, my 50th consecutive Imperial Stout during May/June of 2005, and what a way to reach number 50.  Words cannot express the nirvana (in the non-Buddhist sense) Im in right now.  True, Im an absolute sucker for stouts aged in bourbon barrels, but even compared to others of similar ilk, Goose Islands offering is absolutely incredible.  Im just totally blown away by how wonderfully delicious this beer tastes.  Delectable to the point where Im just sighing with bliss.  Its like listening to Beethovens 9th, a piece which moves me to tears.  This is a masterpiece, perfection in a bottle.  Sweet, malty, roasty, and bitter, with all seemingly in perfect unison and balance.  Sitting on top of all that is a strong, but not overwhelming bourbon flavor, fruity and cherry-like, that takes this beer to heights rarely attained in the beer universe.  Alcohol is fairly strong, and as the beer warms, shows a bit too much relative potency.  The aroma is gorgeous, extraordinarily balanced between roast, sweetness, maltiness and bourbon.  This is a treat for the palate as well as the nose.  Full bodied, yet soft, velvety and caressing, this is palatal bliss.  Fairly viscous, somewhat sticky, but not syrupy, a quick swirl leaves a thin brown film on the glass.  The major negative is with the visuals.  The beer is very dark brown, slightly ruddy at the edges, which isnt the issue.  When I popped the twist-off cap, there was almost no sound, and pouring the beer, it took several seconds for a small, quarter inch of head to form, and then that completely dissipated before I could rinse out the bottle.  Nevertheless, while visuals are nice, they dont make or break a beer for me.  Im gonna be thinking of this beer for days, months, years.  Incredible stuff, and I must obtain more, but this time, Ill try to get more than just a single bottle.  Like with Beethovens 9th, Im once again moved to tears, partially because this beer is so incredible, but also because I only have a few more sips left in my glass.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Flavor is big malty sweet molasses, coffee, chocolates, and lots of bourbon.  Huge alcohol pressense - not hidden as well as I would like, but I think aging will help this a lot.  A very well done imperial stout.","Norcross, Georgia, USA","beeryum"
3451,"2005-05-30",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 4, 2009 thanks to jcapriotti for this bonus brew.(talk about a bonus brew!)ok here we go.the b.c.s. pours a super black body with a nice small chocolate looking head.my nose was gifted with aromas of molasses,brownies,chocolate chips,and roasted malts.talk about an inviting aroma!the first sip slid down my throat.the palate and texture is super thick on this one,just the way i like it.i then took a second sip to see what i could really gather as far as flavor.brownies,molasses,and alcohol were all in the mix,including a tiny bit of raosted malt.this is very tastey although i think the alcohol and sweetness are a little overpowering.still though,this is one serious/delicious impy stout.2006 BOTTLE RERATE:smells like heaven.vanilla,oak,molasses,almonds,chocolate,roas malts...the aroma goes on forever.flavor meets the expectations of the aroma.vanilla,oak,butter,caramel.chocolate,coffee, malt...man o man this thing keeps movin.plus it sticks to my tounge and reminds me of how awsome it is 30 seconds after a sip.i really think this year is head and shoulders above last years.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Odeed"
3451,"2005-05-25",4.1,"Wow, thats good!  Nice sweet molassis aroma.  Great colored head, like brown sugar, though not a whole lot of it:-(   Very smooth the whole way down.  Reminds me of having a good candy bar after not having one for a long time.  As thick at whole milk, and as dark as a 9 month overdue oil change on an 83 Delta88.  Pretty filling though.  Maybe a tiny bit on the sweet side, but with a salty snack thats a good thing.

3451,"2005-05-24",4.5,"This one pours a very dark color with a small head that doesnt stick around long, but leaves a little lacing on the glass.  The aroma is sweet and has some chocolate, vanilla, and dark malts.  The flavor is much the same.  Lots of chocolate and bourbon notes along with some other dark malts.  The body is as thick as it gets.  I couldnt drink more than one because its so filling.  The beer just sticks to the insides of your mouth.  Wow.  The drinkability suffers only from the fact that its so thick.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","clvand0"

Nicely done.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
3451,"2005-05-14",4.4,"So, we finally cracked one of these. After Dark Lord last night, it would take a lot to live up to it. But this does. Wonderful nose, better than DL. Chocolate, coffee, English toffee, molasses, a touch of bourbon. The taste is similar to the nose. Lots of bourbon in the taste, along with the coffee and chocolate. But bourbon is ruler here. Cant wait to see how this mellows out in a year or so. Deep black/brown with a thin foam head. Huge mouthfeel, thick. An awesome stout, Id like to try the unbourbon stout, though.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

Nose is mildly sweet with hints of mocha, dark chocolate and faint smoke.  Taste is a rich blend of chocolate, bourbon, smoke and coffee.  Mouthfeel is full, lush and gorgeous.  Aftertaste is warming and beautiful.  Possibly the best beer Ive ever had..","Westerville, Ohio, USA","Panzuriel"
3451,"2005-04-26",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 16, 2005 12oz bottle, bottled 010105. Served @ 47.5° in my NB worthy glass. Pours dark black and thick with a cappicino colored head. The head justs hangs out on the side of the glass when you take a drink. The aroma started when I popped the cap, and when I stuck my nose into the beer I was left with aromas of chocolately malt, vanilla, oak, bourbon, citrusy fruits and to a lesser extent, dark fruits. Real nice nose! The taste is big, dark malt, oak, bourbon (not overpowering), citrus, and maybe a touch of coffee. This is tasty stuff, reminds me of Dark Lord. The mouthfeel is HUGE, it is really thick stuff. I know it has a 4+ score, which sits it in the 98%, but it might actually be underrated, this is one of the best imperial stouts I have ever had and I usually am pretty picky about bourbon aged beers, it is way too easy to overdo the bourbon flavors. This son of a bitch is so BIG that the bourbon adds flavor without overpowering. Near the end, at 56.5°, the bourbon is more apparent, but still not overpowering. Very, very nice. You should aim for the current bottling according to CaptainCougars review of this and the older bottling.

RERATE: New batch, was able to drive to my local liquor store and get, thats exciting! Bottled 08.16.05. Served at 57.6° in a NB worthy glass. Im sure the appearance  is the same as last time. That bourbon is in the mose, lets hope it isnt overpowering in the taste, that was one of the things I LOVED about the last one. Aroma is large, chocolately malt with oak, vanilla, alcohol, coffee, a bright fruitness, maybe a bit of pine. The inital taste is chocolately malt, coffee, oak, vanilla followed by a rush of alcohol and bourbon flavors along with some fruity bitterness and astringent coffee. The bourbon is in this beer, it is very strong, in fact, but the sheer size of this beer, combined with its other strong flavors, is able to contain it. This beer is a mouthfull and leaves a definate burn in the mouth.  The body is large  but the alcohol really cuts through it. I seem to remember that the alcohol is accentuated as this beer warms, probably will try it again straight from the cellar on a cold winter day. I would have rated it 9/5/8/4/18,  4.4","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"
3451,"2005-04-26",4.1,"Poured deep black with a minimal brown head.  Oily and leaves a brown film on the glass.  Aroma of bourbon, alcohol, and chocolate.

3451,"2005-04-25",5.0,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2005 2005 bottle, consumed December 2005.In my new Goose Island Brewmasters Reserve glass, nonetheless, which I picked up last weekend for this special pilgrimage.  Deep, dark black liquidity and a beautiful dark, creamy tan head that sits on the surface and moves down the sides of the glass with elegant frothy ripples.  A little thinner on the pour than last years batch, but still opaque in the glass.  Aroma and flavor are uncannily consistent with last years batch.  Perhaps a touch more caramel nougats in the aroma, and vanilla via nose and mouth, but I think its just been my evolution as a beer rater and my appreciation for what Greg Hall and the rest of the Goose Island team has accomplished with this beer.  Flavor dimensions resound with familiar echos and predominantly pull from dark chocolate truffles basking in bourbon.  Authoritative with every nuance.  The bourbons not a little pick-me-up, its the leading lady and she daunts the shit out of you, yet masochistically, I dont think I could ever get enough of her.  I waited nearly a year to have this one again, and now after doing so, I feel absolutely certain that this beer has attained perfection, which was something I was hesitant to exclaim in my early rating days, but something that definitely warrants declaring now.2004 bottle, consumed April 2005. 
Thick and black; dense.  Minimal amoeba shaped head.  Aroma is... holy bourbon, Mother of...  Some molasses, charred oak and alcohol wafts.  Flavor is... my Lord, rich rich rich.  Velvety chocolate.  Smooth vanilla, bourbon and oak.  Tastes like a white chocolate truffle filled with Irish cream liquor.  So thick.  So smooth.  Divine execution of malts and hops.  A fine beer in every sense.  Finish is mocha-laden and cotes the palate like wax.  This one could easily replace any meal of the day.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

On the tongue: thick and full, all the way, slick, tasty, but...damn, this is a doozy! Wow, one taste, and it sticks and lingers...oooh, la, la, la...and, every taste lasts a long time, it stands so thick on the palate and in the memory, that one neednt return so soon. but, who can resist?

A bona-fide runner up to Dark Lord, for thickest and chewiest IS....and so slick with the whiskey effect, which Im especially susceptible to...I need a case of this, not one 12 ounce bottle.

Intense sweet aroma of heavy malt, roasted, bourbon, and chocolate. Inintial sweet roasted chocolate, licorice, malty, taste that rolled slowly across the palate to reveal an oaky bourbon flavor with a nice dose of hops to even things out. Great mouthfeel, very very nice beer! Its really too bad we cannot get Goose Island products here in Tennessee. One of my favorite beers I have tasted! I would like to taste it bottled...I think the cask aging is a boost to the flavor. If you live in Chicago rush over to the brewery to try this beer!","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","beerandrugby"
3451,"2005-03-27",4.4,"Bottle from NPDEMPSE.  Pours with the viscosity of overused motor oil, thick and syrupy.  No real head formation to speak of and no lacing.  Aroma is great!  Molasses, hints of vanilla, a little alcohol.  Thick and coating mouthfeel.  Sweet initially with roasted grain bitterness gaining strength slowly.  Bourbon notes with vanilla being predominant.

Pours syrupy-thick, black, opaque, topped with a conservative caramel-colored  head. It clings to the glass like soy sauce. Comes to the nose with a charred, caramely sweetness. Thick on the tongue, warming. Bold, smokey, sticky and sweet, mild EtOH. HEAVY-DUTY! Finishes like a caramel Cohiba. Not a brew I would reserve a shelf for in the fridge (not that  I could afford to-with this one).  Glad I had the opportunity.

3451,"2005-03-18",4.2,"Bottle pours a viscous black, no real head to speak of, lackluster lacing, but the shear blackness of this one speaks volumes.   Just by the looks of it, it appears as if it has been aged for years.   Strong vanilla, appleskin, graham cracker on the nose.   Some chocolate and roasted malts are noticable.   Noticing a bit of alcohol as well.   Sharp on the tongue, vanilla, roasted malts, and quite a bit of Bourbon.   Very unique.   Feeling a bit of heat from this one.   While the alcohol doesnt really show itself, the warming of this one is quite noticable.   Body is big, mouthfeel is coating and somewhat slick.   This is not a beer infused with Bourbon, this is Bourbon infused with beer!   Finishes with more of a fig/date flavor, lots of apple skin, with the aformentioned Bourbon.   This is a strong brew, very warming.   This one is big, VERY big.   I should have shared this, considering the amount I have already had this evening.   By far one of the biggest/heartiest brews ever to grace my lips.   Thanks goes out to Captain Cougar for the trade!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
3451,"2005-03-17",4.7,"Aroma is quite nice, an ever changing array of strength with dark caramel and darker still, chocolate; masked by a firm girth of bourbony sweetness that really comes across as smooth and well checked, mainly due to the chocolate tones keeping it quieter then it ought to be. A nice medley on the nose. Simple notes of vanilla and cookie dough remain ever present as well. As it warms the bourbon makes a bigger effort to overcome the chocolate.

Deep and dark fudgy brown nearly and completely black once fully poured with a late-to-appear thin, dark cocoa cap of whipped cream fluff. The foam creeps away leaving a thin collar and the lacing sticks in small amounts of strings close to the collar.

Taste is thick and oily with a smooth dark chocolatey front, then, as if it had a choice, gets overtaken by a very sweet bourbon heat and tinge thats pretty intense. Whhooffda! This sucker is nicely heated. Still in check though, much like the aroma, the chocolate tones tend to supersede over the top of the flavors but staying underneath the alcoholic heat. An interesting effect. Super awesome finish, subtle, warming, late return of chocolate after the heat settles off leaving leftovers of crispened charred vanilla bean, caramel stickies, and sweet, sweet bourbon. Oh my, what an encapsulated ride of fun this stuff is, wow! That sweet bourbony heat builds strongly and just cinders for what seems an eternity while all the other stuff play underneath.

Feel is powerfully heated with a bourbony sweetness and back-throated burn that is absolutely awesome to behold. Thickishly full body with an oily front and somewhat creamy length throughout the rest of its stay that mediates under the overall heat. If it were a notch less heated it would be phenomenal as far as its feel and drinkability. It could be quite a drinkable treat if it werent so ABV hitting. Although, theres nothing wrong with slowing down and enjoying it, appreciating it, ...loving it, cuz thats what its all about with this one. I didint think Goose Island had it in them, but man does this stuff rock! Nicey nice!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Thicker with a more complex flavor profile than the previous vintage I tried, offering huge prunes, plum, and soy, with big charred roasted malts and more subtle oak and bourbon notes than I remember from the original bottling. The 2006 vintage still has the hot alcohol finish, but everything else seems bolder and better crafted. Outstanding.Previous review:

Deep opaque charcoal brown/black body, thin/medium ochre head.  Strong oak and vanilla aroma with chocolate, soy, and roasted malts in the background.  Flavor started out with dominant oak/vanilla, but there was enough roast and chocolate backing the barrel flavors to provide crucial balance.  Coffee and a touch of soy rounded out the flavor profile.  Pretty full-bodied and a bit sticky with a burnt aftertaste as well as alcohol notes.  Very good.  Thanks JCW!

This beer pours a black as night color with a thin creamy tannish head and some nice lacing. The aroma is strong and wafting... heavy bourbon and oak chips in there...more so than any other barrel aged beer I have smelled to date. Chocolate, caramel, nuts, coffee, toffee and vanilla malt aromas are mixed in with the thick musk of alcohol. It smelled somewhat like a Snickers bar. The mouthfeel is full bodied and round with a slight shutter at the 11% as is to be expected. Chocolate grainy mouthfeel, caramel and nuts really stand out here..it tastes just like a Snickers bar!!!

3451,"2005-03-10",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 22, 2005 Damn, this smells like bourbon sweetness on a chocolate bar.  Its got sweet floral notes, candy sugar, vanilla, molasas, honey, strawberry, raisin, and all sorts of other smells going on here.  This thing needs to calm down, my senses cant take too many smells floating around in one glass.  Flavor is offensively bourbon-tastic.  Its strong a chocolatey, but then its sweet and bourbon flavored.  Now really, did they completely empty the casks before putting the beer in there.  I imagin taking a glass of expedition stout and pouring half a shot of Old Forester and letting it air out for a while would produce something similar.  OK, Im joking around, but this stout seems to really be developed with the bourbon qualities more than anything else.  I think if this beer were a bit weaker it would be perfect because the alcohol bite is the only thing that gets to me.  The complexities come through wonderfully when this beauty warms up, but still get sidetracked from the heaft of alcohol.  Still, it was worth it for the $4 a bottle.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"

3451,"2005-02-24",3.9,"A syrupy dark brown with a thin,m thin brown head, I thought I was pouring out motor oil!  The aroma is a thing to behold (besmell?), vanilla, chocolate, roasted malts, aniseed, some smokiness, and a sour mash alcohol smell.  The mouthfeel is thick and rich, and the stuff gets sticky on whatever it touches.  (Im still combing out my moustach.)  The taste is a complex blending of malts, chocolate, a very slight hop bitterness, and bourbon.  The only downside I see to this is its overwhelmingly bourbon-alcohol finish which buries every other taste.  But this is definitely a fine cigar ale.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
3451,"2005-02-23",4.2,"Bottle. Poured black with medium brown rocky head. Aroma was long and complex. The flavor was rich of bourban, oak, malt and alcohol. Finish was long and had a good bite. Good stout and well worth the hunt to find.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3451,"2005-02-21",4.9,"UPDATED: DEC 10, 2006 Thanks Dough77 for this great ale.  Pours a very, very dark brown and is quite oily-looking.  Nose is great, bourbon, rich roasted malts, chocolate, and some sweet vanilla and alcohol.  Mouthfeel is nice, thick, and full.  I sipped this one for quite a while....when it warms it just gets better and better.  The finish is nicely bitter and alcoholic.  Many say this isnt ""balance""...you know what...theyre right, and thats one of this brews most endearing qualities.  Ive got to pour another.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"
3451,"2005-02-18",4.5,"Big thanks to beer handy for this.  This is #1,450 for me, and I hope to have 50 solid beers leading up to 1,500.  This one pours dark as the night, with minimal tan head.  Aroma of malt, big prunes, dark fruit, chocoff, molasses, scotch, oak, bourbon, berries, vanilla.  Higher intensity aroma than Heresy.  Tastes wonderfully malty, with an oatmeal, blackberry, graham cracker, molasses, chocolate syrup, prune, licorice flavor.  Yes, this is a bit cloying due to its amazing thickness, and the alcohol appears as it warms, yet it remains smooth.  Up there with the DFH Worldwide Stout as far as thickness and intensity of flavor goes (although not as thick or alcoholic).  Gets a bit heavy toward the end, but damn! this is a good beer.  Lightweights, or non-stout fans need not apply.  Beers like this make me proud to be a ratebeerian.  Major props to Goose Island!  JPDIPSO, I agree with your marinade idea.  I may save a few ounces of this to marinate some steak or pork with.  Ill bet it would kick major ass!  Not as smooth as the CWBBS or Speedway, not as complex as Dark Lord (but just as thick), yet amazing in its own right.  The bourbon doesnt overpower the beer, it just accentuates it.  Stouts like this dont come along very often.  Im a hardened, 16 year-veteran beer drinker, and as my last beer of the night this one is intimidating even me!  Bravo, Goose Island.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
3451,"2005-02-14",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2013 Pours dark brown/black, with a tan head. Aromas of bourbon, dark fruit, malt, along with smaller amounts of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Flavors are bourbon, dark fruit, chocolate, malt and a little bit of bitter hops and coffee.  Body is heavy, and it works for this beer. Similar to Barley Johns Dark Knight.","Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA","zathrus13"
3451,"2005-02-14",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2011 Just had this years version on tap, and wow, every bit as good as previously rated, maybe better.  If thats possible!  As other raters have said this stuff is thick and dark.  I swear it pours in clumps!  This would make a great marinade for a thick filet mignon.  Seriously.  There are a lot of flavors going on here.  The aroma is interesting but hard to pinpoint.  In the taste, I get Merlot, a warm fruit brandy, mild hints of chocolate, and yet somewhat astingent notes of coffee.  You really can mix this with a macro and create a more ""normal"" stout, as someone else suggested.  I took Schlafly Pilsner (12 oz) and mixed with 6 oz of Bourbon County Stout.  It was still totally opaque but became slightly thinner in texture.  It totally absorbed the flavor of the pilsner.  Invasion of the Beer Snatchers!","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
3451,"2005-02-13",3.9,"Smallest ullaged bottle to memory (Less than a cm.). Jet black color with a smaller bigger bubbled brown head. Slick and oily appearance. Mellow aromas. Lots of malt with mild licorice, vanilla, stewed prunes and oak cask wood. Slick and thick on the tongue.  Not the normal thick, this is real syrupy thick stuff. Charcoal flavored blackberries, smothered with lighter fluid. The flames could be substantial. I think this could be a great steak marinade for black bavarian grill.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

Flavor of smoked meats, wood, bitter chocolate, and some dark fruit in the finish. One of the best examples of barrel aging I have come across, not overpowing just a firm and positive addition to the flavor and complexity.","Silver Spring, Maryland, USA","jeffin7"
3451,"2005-02-08",3.9,"First a warning: be sure to look at the caps on the bottles, I visited a store where there was obvious signs of leakage, inexcusable for $18/4.  IMO this beer reminds me of past DFH WWS( 18%) that I have had and what has me going back and forth is I dont know if DFH is to be commended for getting this flavor w/o cask conditioning or if it should be Goose Island for selling it at $5/bottle less.  A thick brew, shakes almost like semi-solid jello.  Incredible lacing.  Strong aroma of bourbon and raisins, secondary aroma of chocolate and oak.  Predominately the aroma is very vinous.  Upon first sip the first reaction is the is very thick, clinging, with an almost shot-like feel going down.  Alcohol is out front with a burnt malt taste.  Overall this is a fine brew, better than their Demolition but not as good as their Pere Jacque, especially for the price.  I also prefer the WWS over this, which I compared it to at the beginning.","USA","kane"

3451,"2005-02-07",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2007 This is the good stuff. I would describe it as stout extract you could take a tablespoon
of this stuff mix it with a little Budweiser and have a good stout. Alone it is the stuff beer legends are made of. It pours so thick almost syrup like and I thought it flat at first but the carbonation was there it just took time for it to push through the viscous liquid.
Its black and has a 1.5dark brown head that resembles polyurethane foam that you fill cracks around your house with except this foam is perfectly flat. The aromas of bourbon,
 burnt malt, anise and dark fruit. The sip tasted of strong alcohol and sweet roasted malt leading to bitter coffee then to a treacle finish. I couldnt sip this beer it would take me 2 days to finish. I gulped it down it and enjoyed the rush of alcohol and flavors.

3451,"2005-01-31",4.7,"UPDATED: NOV 12, 2007 Vintage 2007:  Just got my hands on some.  This is awesome.  Thick jet black with a foamy brown head.  Bourbon, chocolate, coffee, caramel malt in the nose.  The aroma was so pleasing that I lingered quite awhile there.  The body was rich and robust, slightly oily and smooth and so very satisfying.  The flavor was well worth the wait and lived up to the aroma with strong Bourbon, coffee, and chocolate notes that caressed the tongue and titilated the palate.  This was ready for drinking as is but holds such promise for cellaring.  My rating numbers are for this 2007 batch.




Poured black with a brown head that disappeared in a flash.  The nose was distillery, bourbon, vanilla, some coffee, prunes.  Thick and viscous palate.  Flavor was intense.  Alcohol.  Malts cut the edge just a tad.  A nice sipping beer on a cold winter night.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
3451,"2005-01-30",4.5,"Wow, this was awesome. Ive had many bourbon barrel aged beers and most have been dominated by whiskey flavor, but this one has a complimentary bourbon flavor. Pours very thick and deep dark black. The nose is strong of whiskey and roasted malts. The flavor profile has hints of vanilla, cherry, sweet malt, and roasted malt followed up by a warming whiskey aftertaste that even non-whiskey drinkers (myself) would enjoy.","New Lenox, Illinois, USA","HopsOrDie"
3451,"2005-01-30",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2007 Ive been pretty disappointed by most of G.I s BIG beers. Good but not special. THIS one makes up for them. Pours like fuckin motor oil in color and substance. Big bourbon,oak,vanillia,mild chocolate aroma and flavor. Great mouthfeel. Take small sips and swirl it around. Leaves the lips sticky. The only drawback is the price. $17-18 a four pack. OUCH! Im saving the other bottle for a nice spring day and the right cigar.
Update with the 2007 vintage. Started out at about 50 F. Not as complex as last year and the Bourbon is too in your face. As it warmed it became barely 2 dimensional. Disappointment indeed. I think they crapped out on quality just to boost the ABV a notch higher. 2007 rating a 3.4.","Lake Zurich, Illinois, USA","Metalhead"
3451,"2005-01-27",4.8,"UPDATED: APR 4, 2005 a phenomenal brew (I am a huge fan of the barell aging fad).  Poured out syrup like, nice and thick. Pitch black with a small tanish head.  Aroma full of so much goodness, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, and some fruits.  After 20 minutes of nosing the beer, the first sip was a delight.  Everything in the aroma but multiplied.  A personal favorite.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","Dough77"

Aroma is more about the barrel aging than the stout.  Its very bourbony, vanilla, and fig like.  Flavor is fruity, with very little smoke or roast qualities to it, uh but the boubon, its there and its excellent.  Finish is very sweet and wet.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"

3451,"2004-09-26",3.9,"Tasted at Delilahs in Chicago on tap. The tap handle indicated it was a 2000 vintage. Sampled in October of 2004. Forgive me if the atmosphere at Delilahs prevented the recording of some of the subtler nuances of this but rest assured I have a good handle on it. Poured by the bartender with very little head but what was there lasted for the duration of the beers existence outside of my stomaches. The color is simply black. Nose is rather intense and vinous with some boozy notes. Flavor is similarly rich in flavor with loads or roasted goodness, a slight sweetness and warming alcohol presence. Certainly a tasty treat and one Id like to sample again under more ideal note-taking circumstances.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

I mustve been drinking from the bottom of the barrel on a prior tasting.

2 oz at Southeastern Gathering.  The aroma hinted at something that would be strong. Very bold smoked flavor.  There is almost a buttery quality that threw me off, and  I couldnt get over it.  The bite was a little overwhelming as well.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"

3451,"2003-11-26",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 27, 2006 Rerate of 1/05 batch: Aroma has mellowed some revealing a little oxidation and more earthy, roasty caramel dripping with bourbon.  Still reveals some alcohol as it warms and sweet viscous malt.  Seems to have aged fairly well, but will probably get even better.

Rerate on 4/11/06 of the January 05 batch: Pours a viscous oily opaque with a thin covering of dark tan swirls and spotty lacing.  Sweet candy dark chocolate bourbon aroma is just as great as ever with nice vanilla and oak subtleties.  Body starts with lots of sweet, sticky, caramel malt, nice dark fruit complexity, some brown sugar and vanilla toward a lightly roasted, warming bourbon finish.  This has got another couple of good years in it.

Rerate on 12/19/05: This is the third bottled batch I believe (8/16/05) and seems a bit too warm to live up the previous version.  Ill let it sit for a while and see how it progresses.

Rerate on 2/19/05 side by side tasting of the 2003 batch aged just over a year and the latest batch bottled on 1/5/05: New bottle pours a tremendously thick oily opaque black with a finely lacing frothy dark brown head.  Old bottle is a little less viscous and the head is a little lighter in color and thinner.  The older bottle seems to have a more pronounced bourbon aroma, while the new one is more subdued and malty with nice dark fruit presence.  A slight touch of butterscotch oxidation is present in the older version toward its finish along with some bourbon oaky alcohol felt deep in my throat.  The new version is much thicker and maltier with nice sticky caramel throughout and a great complex bourbon balance.  The only negative thing is the warming acidic alcohol that doesnt show up until it hits my stomach.  Otherwise, this new version is a sure winner.  Thanks JCW!

Bottle rated on 11/26/03: Rich oily black with little carbonation and a thin ring of light brown foam.  Heavy, complex roasted malt and bourbon oak aroma with a sweet dark cherry fruitiness.  Thick robust syrupy sweet dark chocolate body is very well balanced with a tart, but complex bourbon oaky flavor.  Wonderful complexity throughout and a lightly alcoholic, but enjoyable finish.

3451,"2003-11-25",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2005 2004: Flowing molasses with maple highlights. Sticky, creamy copper froth. Lively bourbon aroma with notes of tannins, melted fudge, butter, candied pecans, and vanilla. Oxidized wood caresses the rich chocolate and portlike undertones.  All emphasis is on the fudgy malts and bourbon, leaving only a glimpse of dark fruity esters. Soft and viscous on the palate. Velvety, spongy carbonation. Immensely complex notes of vanilla and dark chocolate, trailed by a mild vinous tingle and a touch of toasted wood and raisins. Grainy caramelized sugars  cushion the rich chocolate and soft vanilla to perfection. Finishes shockingly rich yet balanced by a mixture of black malt char, bourbon, oak, and caramel.  Fudge and molasses notes coat the tongue as the bourbon lingers to seal the deal. Extremely luscious.  (9,5,9,4,18)

Something has drastically changed. Both the foam and  body are doubtlessly on the lighter side. Carbonation is also less dense than the 2004 and the silky viscosity is no longer evident. Charred barrel character is still in full force as it acts as the anchor, but the finish is overwhelmingly brash with alcohol, medicine, and body-thinning tannins. And its overly sweet, mushy, and rampant with sweet and husky corn notes. No definitive vinous notes or fruity esters, whatsoever. Good, but this is not the gem that it was a year ago. Among other things, this particular batch needs a lengthy slumber in the cellar to tone down the alcohol. Currently it comes across as just another mushy, oversweet, bourbon-saturated makeshift Imperial that has only suffered by being aged in a bourbon barrel.

3451,"2003-11-22",2.7,"For me this is one of those beers when confronted with a style that you may not like how should you rate it?  I am a fan of stouts, but apparently not those that are aged in whiskey barrels.  The beers pours a rich dark black and one whiff leaves you wondering if this is a beer or some Johnnie Walker.  No head.  The taste is overwhelming whiskey with sour cherries and strong roasted malt.  I am sure some love this beer.  I am not one of them.","Rochester, New York, USA","JahNoth"
3451,"2003-11-11",4.3,"Bottled. Ah, yes. The Goose was the first brewpub I ever knew of, and I enjoyed grabbing a couple of Gooses by the neck... and then this came along: the first beer that made me say, ""Oh... my... freakin' God!"" Now it's out in bottles though hard to find:
A deeper Imperial Stout-type nose. Big bourbon flavor, even powerful like a Hennessey. Beautiful black with red highlights. I saw the bourbon barrels they were aging this in at the brewery a few months back, and I'm pleased to say they've bottled it beautifully!","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
3451,"2003-11-02",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2003 2nd of my Stouts of November: The last bottle left at Clybourn, damn! Expedition snifter glassware: Nearly opaque with a oily film once the small tan head disappeared and good tears. Aroma is huge, heavy malt character of molasses, espresso, mocha, vanilla. Nose also detected the borbon smoky character, aromatic hops, some raisin and plum. The taste was big and sticky sweet initally but a nice dose of bitterness and touch of alcohol cleaned the palate. Smoky, coffee dry, and woody finish. Complex and full-bodied. A wonderful brewers expression of the style, which is an Imperial IMO. I wish I had more bottles.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
3451,"2003-10-23",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2005 As the bourbon aged craze rages on, I often think backto the first (at least that I can  recall)...Bourbon County Stout.  At least from 1998. This beer simply rocks.  Over-the-top chocplate, vanilla, molasses and bourbon flavors.  ZThick as 10W30 with a neat deep brown/red hue.  This beer will age a well as any beer that I have tried.  I first rated this lower due, primarily to the high alcohol taste.  But it has dawned on me that this is intended and is not a function of the 11% abv but the bourbon characteristic taken on by hte barrel aging.  Anyway, ages ti a forget about dissing this so-called fad.  Any process that continues to fortify the unique and overwhelming flavors typically reserved for port wines and single malt scotches is fine with me.","Palos Heights, Illinois, USA","EddieG"
3451,"2003-10-02",3.0,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2013 i first had the 9.0% in 2003, something which was a completely different experience than the current 12-15% versions. sheesh fellas, way to booze up and ruin a great stout. now, the early 2000s batches had a beautiful glowing caramel head on top of pitch black body,  bourbon was dominant but not boozy at all, thankfully. espresso sugar flavors, thick and potent.  a bit starchy, spice / wood character from the barrel treatment.  nice stuff, probably in the 3.7-4.2 range.  the 2010+ years are around 3.0.  boozy and sweet, goopy and flabby.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3451,"2003-07-18",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2005 12 capped bottle (1st commercial release, January 2005, sampled November 2005): thick opaque liquid chocolate, with a full ruby brown fluffy head.  Strong alcohol notes in the aroma, though it doesnt have the strong bourbon notes that many of the others do.  Vanilla bean and charcoal essence round out the oak and light hop bitterness.  Smooth, creamy texture with vinous dark fruits and roasted malts.  Amazing  just as solid as I remember on draught a couple years ago!

Draught, 2003 version (Clybourn brewpub): Extremely dark brown, lightly sweet cherries, sugar and dark caramel encompass an aroma that is milder (without the stinging alcohol) than I was expecting. . . A bit of alcohol on the palate, with a small amount of whiskey, nice plump raisins, candy sugar, strawberries, lime, and a nice bitter finish.  I like this one more than many of the other bourbon barrel aged beers I have tried - this one seems to have more complex flavours that go beyond the whiskey.  Nice.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
3451,"2003-07-11",4.0,"Very dark brown and oily-looking.  Bourbon aroma – sweet charcoal, slight vanilla, prunes and big rich malts.  Long charcoal and vanilla palate, with noticeable alcohol.

The aroma is of bourbon, coconut and espresso. Nuff said!
The flavor is of Irish Coffee with bubbles. I like whiskey. I like bubbles. Whats not to like about this beer?
Full-bodied with a heavy, oily mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Lengthy, bitter, huge alcoholic finish. Yum! World-class stout!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

3451,"2003-06-29",4.3,"This brew pours a very small dark brown head of fine bubbles that quickly disappear and left little lacing.  It was incredibly smooth for what I was expecting to come from this very thick black bodied beer.  Its 9% alcohol content is extremely well hidden.  It gave mny whole mouth a tingling sensation with a very stong sweet malt molasses flavor.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
3451,"2002-11-10",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2005 Wow.  I dont even know what to say about this one.  It was complex as all hell.  A nice kick of whiskey complemented the sweet stout flavors.  Smooth, malty and a touch of smoke augmented the roasted coffee and chocolate flavors.  Also, a touch of sweet, dark fruit entered the picture.  Good, but not great.Reconsidering this beer after trying it again, I do find it to be a bit sweet and extremely strong tasting.  One snifter was more than enough.  The flavor is more persistent than I remember with other bourbon-barrel aged beers, but Im not sure thats best here.  Its just really sweet and sticky.  Too much.Well, Im on my fourth batch of this stuff, and I must say its growing on me.  The whiskey is strong but its not terrible.  Maybe its the fact that Ive had more barrel-aged stuff, but its not as bad as I remember.  Plus, the cask-conditioned sample I had last night was superb.  Either way, I feel I have to bump it up from a 3.6","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
3451,"2002-07-26",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 27, 2005 12oz. bottle @ Clybourn location:  this is a wonderful beer.  I finally got to Chicago to have it again after many years.  This one pours an inky, thick, very dark brown color.  The pour from the bartender resulted in almost no head, and what was there was light brown and didnt last at all.  The nose is full of bourbon.  Not as much as a shot, but very nice.  Also some noted of chocolate, vanilla, and roastiness.  The taste is incredibly rich and smooth, thick and silky.  The flavor of bourbon is there, but well balanced with a full rich imperial stout behind it.  A hint of sweetness in the aftertaste.  This is phenominal!!!!","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
