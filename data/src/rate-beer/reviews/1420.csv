Tried to find this for a long time back in the day as its got quite the hype surrounding it (not so anymore, it seems). Lovely ruddy-auburn body shows good clarity and a light beige head with good retention.Clean yeast in the nose allows light fruit esters (apples, berries) and theres a touch of toasted malt, sourdough and dry toffee. A pepperiness is the extent of the hop character, but the beer being moderately dry on the malt side dosent require any more. No flaws, no alcohol.Lightly bitter, peppery hops, again, with soft, playfully fruity notes from the medium malts and yeast ending on a slightly toasted malt note and some light salinity. Dry, overall, but there are certainly glimpses of finely extracted malts, giving off just bits and pieces of caramel and honey. Ample carbonation and a lightly grainy body. The salty/seltzery notes are a bit odd, but quite minimal and otherwise this is a very well-brewed, elegant, very understated beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

NOS : na pierwszy niuch wyczuwam aromaty czerstwego ciemnego chleba, metalu, ciemnego miodu. Po wstrząśnięciu nuty słodowe się uwypuklają do tego dochodzą nuty kwiatowe. Ogólnie zapachy są średnio intensywne. 

USTA : średnio gazowane piwo o tłustej teksturze i wodnistej konsystencji. 
Piwo jest subtelne.

The smell is of yeast, malt and some roastyness.

The middle is of caramell/roasted malt and citrus hops, the finish is spicy, citric and bitter, which gives a perfect balance to the malt  and remains in a pleasant aftertaste.

1420,"2007-01-11",4.6,"Vom fass @ Brauerei Im Füchschen, Düsseldorf, Germany. With the sun now beating down, the life arising in the streets of the morning - Summer 06 - my wife and I now well fed at this lovely old, timber everything, Brauhaus, it was time for the Altbier to come out. Our Kobe - a lovely, English speaking chap - was all too happy to tell us about their beers, I on the other-hand just needed to taste it. From out the cavernous Brauhaus he presented two glasses of Alt, ticked the coaster and smiled before walking away. The glass began to sweat quickly, its contents a bright, tight, orange copper, quite still, with a Real-ale messy, frothy off-white head that would be the envy of CAMRA. Toffee, burnt sugar and ripe, tangy oranges on the nose with a degree of peppery spice guaranteed to tickle the nerve endings. Bitter sweet fruits in the mouth, juicy, quenching and tight. Toasted malt shows, provides a solid base for the ample fruit and onslaught of hops to follow as it moves across the palate. SilkTork once told me to simply swallow and not think about the beer so much, I could not do that here. This was juicy. Fresh picked hop buds seem to be still swimming in the fruit punch mix. Its finish is bitter, fruity, tangy but clean and oh so long down the back. The linger of fruits supplemented by dusty malt flavours, a little roasted malt even. In Düsseldorf, as with Köln, every one has their favourites and this was mine. A lovely Altbier, a lovely Brauhaus and a handsome tip for our Kobe. Prost Düsseldorf!!!","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

1420,"2006-01-27",4.8,"If you ever decide to take a trip to Germany, a visit to the state of Northrine-Westphalla is in order. It is here that you will find many of the industries that help fuel the German economy, and it is here that you will find the cities of Cologne, and Dusseldorf. Dusseldorf is a thriving city with lots of big industry, but dont let the industrial nature of the city throw you off, as there is a lot to do and see. The Konigsallee has some of the best shopping to be found in Germany, with plenty of chic choices for those who love to shop. And then there is the Altstadt. It is here you will find a very vibrant night life with scores of restaurants, and bars. 

For a beer lover, it does not get any better, as it is here you will find the local specialty, altbier and plenty of it. With in walking distance of each other you will find about nine different places that specialize in serving altbier, and one of my favorites is Brauerei Im Fuchschen which was founded in 1848. ""The Fox Den"" is a very traditional brewery/brewpub with dark wood panels, pine top tables, and a cozy, inviting decor. Here on the menu you will find traditional, hearty German fare, and one delicious beer to wash it down. That beer is Fuchschen Altbier, and like with all altbiers found in the Altstadt, expect the Kobes or waiter to serve you glasses of this beer continuously until you tell him to stop. The beer flows freely at Im Fuchschenm poured by gravity from a wooden barrel or vom fass. 

Fuchschen Altbier pours to a beautiful, bright copper color with a bright white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is fragrant with herbal/grassy hop aromas that lead into a sweet malty palate. A touch of estery fruit follows the initial malt sweetness, and then ends with a very vibrant grassy/herbal hop bite that slightly lingers. 

Very fresh tasting and very drinkable, Fuchschen altbier is the type of beer you will want to drink a lot of. What I love so much about altbier is the contrast of malt and hop character in this beer style. It is almost as if you are getting two beers in one, as you get that initial malt/fruit character up front, which quickly gives way to the vibrant hop character. Fuchschen altbier is another stellar example of this classic Dusseldorf style, and a good example of the range within this style. This beer has more sweet malt flavor than other alts I tried in Dusseldorf, and gives this beer its own signature. 

While all these classic alts are similar they are very different as well. Give it a try and taste for yourself. You will have to come to Germany to do so, as Fuchschen altbier is not exported, at least not to the United States. But that is fine with me, as I can not think of a place I would rather drink this beer than poured fresh from the barrel.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

I have never been to Im Füchschen but I remember the guard houses before, there we little kids stood while the Mardy Grass parade was stamping by. Cool. Ok the beer on tap  = 3.8: Nice malty, barn, cereal nose with some hints of sulphur. Nice Amber, more in the brown area, color soft carbonation, little fast diminishing head, leaving brussels laces. First a fruity and malty taste that becomes bitter - long lasting bitterness with malt inveralls. Dry finish. Nice RERATE: bottled vision seemed to taste better - maybe as the beer on tap was younger. Nice hoppy and malty - more nutty aroma.
