59,"2017-05-11",4.3,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 8/17/2016. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger bread, vanilla, rum, toasted oak, toffee, brown sugar, and brown bread; with light notes of molasses, chocolate, cocoa, dark fruits, herbal, and oak/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of pumpkin, spices, bready malt, and rum barrel notes; with big strength. Minimal booziness as it warms. Taste of huge pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger bread, vanilla, rum, toasted oak, toffee, brown sugar, and brown bread; with light notes of molasses, chocolate, cocoa, dark fruits, herbal, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/spice bitterness and rum/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger bread, vanilla, rum, toasted oak, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light molasses/cocoa, and herbal/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of pumpkin, spices, bready malt, and rum barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Light dryness from bitterness and rum/oak spiciness, increasing through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy, and fairly sticky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden; a small increasing warmth, with mild barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial pumpkin ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of pumpkin, spices, bready malt, and rum barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the enormous ABV. Absolutely perfectly balanced between malt, spice, and rum barrel complexity. Great barrel presence without being overly boozy, tannic, or drying. After less than 9 months of age, this is already ready to go. The 17.5% is exceptionally well masked. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Nose explodes with real pumpkin and traditional pie spice, really explosive and inviting; a little sugary, but waves of vanilla, cream, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, apple, lesser allspice and faint ginger [the latter turns up more in the aftertaste]. Pours deep amber-brown with a fizzy tan head that isnt long for the world. In the mouth, quite sweet but stopping just a step short of cloying, sugary, light-medium bitterness, and a huge fireball of scorching alcohol, not bold enough to ruin the taste buds, but enough to throb the throat and chest for a while. Stronger caramel and thicker malt as I go, touch molasses/treacle. Getting a lot of vanilla and barrel character, definitely oaky and tannic, but not so dramatically distinguished that Id pick out rum. Full body but not fat, picking out more berry with time, even some maple in the sweetness, but unfortunately the great pumpkin impression fades as the cleansing, antiseptic spirit character grows to dominate all else  I feel like Im doing shots after about three ounces. Still, for one of the bigger beers [at 18%], pretty well done, flavorful and stays on-topic without collapsing into a fuselly mess like some of Averys other offerings.

Going with a crowd-pleaser to be judged against over-specified style guidelines by a room-filling number of judges?

59,"2015-08-29",1.7,"Draught at Publick House, October 2014.Clear, drab copper-beige with some light auburn tints and a small, fleeting beige head.Alcohol, pie spicing, candied fruits and not a ridiculous amount of rum or pumpkin (though theyre certainly both present). With warming, obviously, the booze and spice do get pretty unbearable.First sip is sweet, nearly syrupy but for the loosening effect of the rum/booze. Warm pumpkin pie and spices makes an appearance but is massively outdone by the candied sweetness. Light citrus and fruitiness on the edges. Low carbonation not helping the cause, leaving a heavy, cloying, boozy effect on the palate.

Avery keeps it crown (over Founders, Southern Tier and Firestone Walker) has the producer of the most hard to drink big beers in the USofA. There are parts of this that on their own are tasty... I like the bold rum notes and the spices alone are a brash hit to the groin but when you add it all together, it is a confluence of overbearing spice, booze and cloying sweetness that just does not work.

Pours a clear, firey dark red color, with a soon vanishing head.

Has an almost overwhelming, wooden barrel character, which gets enhanced by an incredibly zesty, herbal, sweet spiciness, featuring glazed pumpkin and burning booze, all put into an intriguing balance. The brews complex, honeyed maltiness interacts well with the slighty fermented, earthy and sweet pumpkin, both smells blending together hold the barrel intensity at bay.

This is so much sweeter than I expected it to be, with loads of molasses, toffee and cane sugar, kicking my teeths in, finished off wih an intense alcoholic burn, while the barrels woodenness gets almost swallowed entirely by the sugar. The malt foundations gets overpowered by the sweetness already during the very beginning, joined by a sharp alcoholic impact, and only manages to try finding its balance during a later stage, due to the calming herbs and spices, which all in all arent capable to stop the sugar madness too. The rum barrel is very well integrated though, providing a burning, slightly bitter counterpart to the sugar, which would result into a slightly dry, medicine-like impression, if it wasnt for the muddy, leafy herbs of mace, cardamon and vanilla, to provide some sort of balance. FInishes with caramelized malts among molasses and an confirming booziness, leaving enough space on the palate for the actual pumpkin to fit in, supported by wooden herbs.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Glass: Duvel tulip.
Appearance: Clear and deep garnet hue with a tall but thin tan head that dissipates to a fuzzy coating.
Aroma: Sweet rum, brown sugar, vanilla, oak, and pumpkin are all here. A dash of cinnamon is noted. Aroma leans sweet and complex, really nice.
Taste: Sweet rum, brown sugar and caramel are huge here, with vanilla accenting them. Underlying pumpkin is noted during the mid-taste with some cinnamon. The finish adds a sugary coating with pumpkin being more noticed, adding a vegetal presence on the finish. This is sweet and a dash boozy, but I think it delivers exactly what most people would expect.
Palate: Thick and mildly carbonated.

How: Bottle 12oz, not sure about the age (around 8 months old I think), bottle sent to me by adnielsen, thanks Aaron.
The look: Ugly murky amber-brown body with almost no head.
In long: Nose is intensely sweet dessert, cinnamon bun with glazing, sweet pumpkin pie.  Taste is spicy Christmas candy cane, ice-cream cone (without ice-cream), cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugars, alcohol heat, pumpkin seeds, pastry, spicy hard candies (like those classic red fish-shaped candies), sweet cough syrup, cheap sweet table syrup, a shot of cheap hard liquor.  And I could probably go on and one, doesnt mean the beer is complex, just that it is very intense and so sweet and also spicy that it can taste many things.  Have I noticed the 15% abv before opening the bottle I think I would have cellared it for a full year.  Body is not even rich despite the abv, just very very sweet and juicy, the texture of a concentrate fruit juice with carbonation.  This is gross, I couldnt finish a singly 12oz bottle.  I know ratebeer scores are mostly a measure of intensity and not quality but Im still very much puzzled as to how a piece of junk like this can get such good marks.

59,"2012-11-24",3.5,"Batch 2, bottled 9/17/12. 12 oz foil topped bottle into a brandy snifter.

A - Pours a rather clear burnt orange/brown color. Some small off white bubbles dissipate quickly leaving behind a very still body. Swirling creates some minute bubbles and leaves behind a thin alcoholic trace.

S - Pumpkin and squash flesh, cinnamon, nutmeg, and some rich malty toffee. The finish is harsh alcohol and some sweet vanilla. The beginning is quite nice and reminiscent of many pumpkin ales, but the alcohol just burns the nose and prevents the aroma from being approachable. I find myself smelling it from a few inches away from the glass rather than stuffing my nose in like most beers. 

T - Starts off with some basic roasted pumpkin flesh flavors along with the standard spices of cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, and all spice. These flavors are then interrupted by a huge wave of alcohol that burns the mouth and throat. Aftertaste is of oak and some brief vanilla. The rum is hardly noticeable. Disappointing and light in the flavor department. Its saving grace is that its not too sweet or cloying.

M - Medium to thin bodied with low carbonation. Drink ability is quite low. Im struggling with the first 6 oz pour.

O - I really wanted to like this one, but alas Im just left perplexed. Sticking a pumpkin ale in a rum barrel sounds like an amazing idea.

A: Pours an almost brown body with dark orange a small, quick dissolving off white head. It recedes to a very thin collar, but doesnt leave any lace. The body is lively with carbonation though.

S: Smells like a rum soaked pumpkin pie. Crumbly pie crust, pumpkin pulp, cinnamon, allspice, a touch of nutmeg and some sweet rum round this guy out. Very interesting to say the least.

T: The taste takes a complete 180 here. Notes of caramel, burnt sugar, rum soaked dark fruits and some oak all shine together. A sweet spiced rum makes its presence known in the middle and a malty vanilla sweetness thats almost on the verge of be cloying rounds it out. The is a great warming sensation on the finish, but it isnt hot. There is barely any pumpkin to be found.

M: Full bodied with a stick and coating mouthfeel, yet the carbonation is slightly prickly to keep the tongue interested. The taste lingers in the mouth for quite sometime. This is definitely a sipper.

O: This was a very interesting beer. It had old ale and barleywine qualities to it. The pumpkin gets lost in the taste really and I would have like more of the nose to shine through in taste. If it had a touch more pumpkin I would have given this a much higher score. Not bad, very different.

Hops are not present, this beer is all about sweet malt and spiced pumpkin.Taste is of sweet, buttery diacetyls, pumpkin pie, clove and nutmeg. Caramelized brown sugar and Belgian Rock sugar is also there, this beer shares similarities  to a high quality barleywine or quad. Hops are non existent, alcohol is faint but for 16% alcohol, dangerously well hidden. Rum barrel added some sweetness and spice to overall flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly syrupy, pretty typical for the alcohol content. The head could have been fuller, thats my only gripe with the texture of this beer.Overall this beer was amazing. I?ve had it fresh and aging it for almost a year has transformed it into a completely different class. This beer is definitely the gold standard when it comes to Pumpkin/spiced beers, yet its uniquely different from any pumpkin beer I?ve had. Its a shame that there is no more of this beer available and no plans have been made to release it again.

The latter takes precedence with the sweet boozy dark fruit tones while the pumpkin takes a backseat. Brown sugar notes mesh well with the aforementioned... Flavors follow suit with more of the same with an emphasis on the big robust notes from the barrel. Pronounced dark fruit and rum notes throughout. Pumpkin in the backend but gets overwhelmed by the base beer. Body isnt as big as one would thin but the booziness more than makes up for that. A fair amount of heat surfaces from beginning to end.

3.0 A: Transluscent darker amber color. Just one finger of fizzy off white head that fell in an instant. Ill cut Avery a break since this has a monster ABV.

4.0 S: Definitely unlike anything Ive ever smelled before. Pumpkin (as in the real stuff) is explosively present in this. The spices have apparently died down a bit, but theres theres hints of nutmeg and cinnamon. Only mildly boozy, which is impressive for the ABV. Caramel maltiness. Rum adds a nice underlayer of complexity 

4.5 T: I must say I like this quite a bit. Rum and pumpkin work together. Its as simple as that. Like the nose, pithy pumpkin is abundant. Spices are a bit more apparent with nutmeg and cinnamon again leading the charge. Plenty of caramel with a light toastiness. Booze is there, but this seems more like a 10% brew than a 15.9% one. Rum gives a sweet molasses.

4.5 M: Heavy body. Rich creaminess with a sticky molasses component. Very nice.

4.5 D: I like this beer a lot. I think pumpkin beers are a great thing, but sooo many breweries bitch out and make weak, tasteless base beers and throw pumpkin spices in. Avery gets all the credit in the world for bucking that trend.

Spices come on nicely towards the end as this finishes with a slightly sticky sweetness, a distinct alcohol warmth, vanilla, spices, and lots of rum barrel. The spices and barrel really finish this nicely. The booze is clearly there, but not nearly as overpowering as the aroma. Its sweet, but fairly dry with really nice, lengthy aftertaste consisting of plenty of pumpkin, lots of spices, barrel, and a very pleasant sweetness. Medium-full, slightly sticky body with a soft, light carbonation. Overall, a really nice beer. The aroma wasnt anything special, but the flavor and the way this finished really did it for me. Sweet and very warming with lots of pumpkin, but well spiced with lots of barrel while finishing well attenuated. I thoroughly enjoyed this huge beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

I am so completely tired of these sugar bombs that are being passed off as beer.  Fuck this beer and all like it.  Give me something thats been through a fermentation process next time.

Tastes still like kibble, but with heaping spoonfuls of sugar or hfcs Once the sugar rush subsides, there is a brown sugar, rum, and pumpkin finish.

Flavor is intense rum and cinnamon, with a touch of pumpkin here and there. The rum cuts right to my taste buds. If there is ONE alcoholic beverage that I drink besides beers, its rum, and I can taste that shit every which way here. Even rating this ~30 minutes after tasting it, I still have that taste in my mouth. Slight wood touches here and there, as well. The rum dominates, the spices come second, and after that its a long drawn out alcoholic ride. Too much rum here; it interferes with the spices. Great beer, but I could have appreciate a little less presence of the rum. Too thin of a texture for the style.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

The taste was a lot of booze and sweet fruits. No surprises. Very crisp and full.

Nose is 100% strawberry Twizzlers with starchy sugar, thick artificial strawberry, and big candied yams so much so that they come across as straight sugary candy. Nose has overtones of cider vinegar. Odd stuff. Dont really get ""pumpkin"" or ""rum."" Then again, Goslings rum is pretty inferior stuff and the barrels probably have no character left. Taste is wildly sweet...its not bad in any way, but there is just no way to drink more than 4oz of this. If you have a bomber at home, you might want to call up some friends or share this at a Christmas party. Very sweet with strawberry candies, Twizzlers, cinnamon, perhaps something like candied yams but it is just too over the top.

AROMA: Barleywine, molasses, pumpkin, candied dates, rum soaked raisins, mild spice (nutmeg, faint cinnamon). Get faint hint of the ginger as well as oak (and dash of vanilla) after strong swirl. 

TASTE: Rum barrel forward, pumpkin, barleywine, molasses, candied dates. Can definitely taste the oak and vanilla notes from the barrel. 

Subtle earthiness mid palate (perhaps from the wood). Faint bitterness on finish. 

MOUTH FEEL: Syrupy. Fair amount of heat from alcohol. Feels like the aging in barrels smoothed it out a bit (ie, took some of the edge off).

OVERALL: Typical big beer from Avery: massive and somewhat cloying. However, I had this instead of dessert because I knew it would be quite sweet. So since I was wanting something sweet after dinner, I found this brew quite enjoyable.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"

Pours a darker amber brown hue, touches of red, fairly murky and dark with a decent carbonation, touch of tannish ringed head, dies to small clinger, tiny lacing.

Initial is medium bodied, with a more potent flavor. Rum and oak mix with pumpkin, caramel, toffee. Biscuits and spices, pie spices with nutmeg, cinnamon, a touch of barrel and spirit heat, brown sugar and sweetness. Vanilla, more sweet sticky malts thinned a bit by the barrel. Man, as this gets further in its fairly hot and boozy on the palate, spices and pumpkin puree mix. Rich and spicy, a lot of barrel, but not overdone, just quite warm and spicy on the backend and finish. Flavors are solid, barrel is assertive, aroma doesnt move me. Nice.

59,"2011-11-10",4.4,"Bottle from BevMo: Color was a medium brown hue that appeared similar to a glass of dark rum and had no head whatsoever. My nose picks up on a scent of sourness usually associated with a Belgian Flemish ale, though, some scents of pumpkin puree and other pumpkin spices come through in the aroma. Also, the aroma suggests a touch of sweet sugary syrup like malts while the rum barrel aging adds additional spices. As for the drink, the flavors are boasting of spiced rum along with the pumpkin spices. An intensely sweet flavor of candy sugars, molasses, maple syrup, and possibly a pinch of brown sugar. This beer is really held together by the barrel aging since the rum really rubbed off well and morphed this pumpkin beer into one that stands out compared to the rest. I just cant even imagine all the planning and work involved in this beernice job Avery. Well deserving a perfect score in taste.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

Definite cinnamon flavors and vanilla. The pumpkin flavors are there as well. The rum is apparent upfront but fades into the background. This really blends well together.

Head is initially small, fizzy, light brown, fully diminishing.
Body is dark amber.

Aroma is moderately to heavily malty (caramel), lightly hoppy (apricot), with strong notes of alcohol and oxidation (sherry/cardboard/walnut shells), light notes of vanilla, candy sugar, and nutmeg.

Flavor is heavily to harshly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, papery.

Medium to full body, syrupy texture, fizzy carbonation, heavily alcoholic.

Fabulously awful.  On the surface this is sorta the trademark Avery beer...way over the top in alcohol and sugar.  But more than usual...and the only other major aromatic is oxidation.  So theres very little to like in the nose.  The tertiary notes just cant save it...theyre all but buried under the cardboard and caramel.  In the mouth, even worse...tooth-achingly syrupy-sweet with a savage alcohol burn and papery aftertaste...pretty much impossible to enjoy (or even drink at all).

I do not get any pumpkin on the smell with the dominance of the rum.  Taste is huge thick, sweet malt (like a barley wine) with rum, spicy alcohol, and some spices.

Pours a moderate brownish color with a bit of an orange tint to it. Theres some light lacing after a single-finger head dies down. The nose is pretty boozy, but at the same time it works with the brown sugar and dark rum character in addition to plenty of pumpkin spicing. Everything is well integrated and though its boozy, the rum notes work well with the pumpkin and spicing, so I dont have anything to complain about.

The taste goes quite a ways downhill as the intricate rum characteristics are overlaid with all too much booze. Just really, really heavy on the alcohol here. There is some spicing there as well. The feel takes it even lower, as there is nothing there but booze. Pretty heavy body. Drinkability isnt all that high given the excessive booze. Its a shame that the booze took this one over. I wish this were in bottles so I could lay one down for a year to see what happens.

Should have checked before buying.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
59,"2010-11-05",3.4,"Draft at DTJBs. Brilliantly clear orange amber hue, no head; nose is fair spices and gourds, somewhat muted; flavor is big tones of pumpkin and yams, spices (cardamom, cinnamon, anise), herbal-plant tones border on medicinal, finishes syrupy sweet with alcohol warmth; full body, light carbonation, thick texture; very spiced specialty fall beer, interesting in small doses only.","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"
59,"2010-11-05",3.1,"Pours a shiny petrified amber..nose of pumpkin and vanilla, and maybe a little banana as well as caramelized sugar.  Flavors are somewhat cumbersome with alcohol and sweetness, phleghmy bitterness, some burnt sugar and just overall messy flavor profile. Alcohol makes it quite quesy feeling...this beer is proof that most people on ratebeer are idiots. A 4+ average so far?  Really? Hahahaha fucking amateurs.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
59,"2010-11-05",3.5,"On tap at  the Rare Beer Breakfast at Stone. Thanks to Dr. Bill for getting this beer.
This orange pour has a nice combination of pumpkin & spiciness thats complemented well by the barrel aging.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
59,"2010-11-04",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2012 2011 bottle thanks to Ratman197. pours a deep red.  lots of spice on the nose with dark fruit, sugar and light rum notes.  deep and smooth body with rum, dark fruits, spices, sugar and light vanilla.  warming finish with more layers of dark fruit and spices.  the rum barrels coat the beer in a supportive role which leaves an underlying character while not dominating the beer.

on tap at The Brick Store Pub during the Avery Beer Dinner on 11/2/10.  Deep orange pour with a 1 finger white head.  Lots of rum barrel on the nose with light pumpkin and lots of spice - especially nutmeg.  medium to full body with more rum, vanilla, oak, light pumpkin, nutmeg, allspice, sweet malts, and lots of sugar.  big sweet candy finish with some alcohol heat, more spice, apple, and banana.  a true desert in a glass.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","craftbeerdesign"
59,"2010-11-03",4.3,"CBC Pumpkin Fest. Smells of candied sugar, rum and some vanilla. Pours a dark orange. The taste of rum shines through significantly dominating most of the other flavors but adding an aspect of complexity to the otherwise dull world of pumpkin beers. One of my all time favorite pumpkin beers.","Westfield, Massachusetts, USA","dogfish120love"
59,"2010-10-24",3.9,"Notes from Thursday, October 03 2010
On tap at Avery tap room, 10 oz. pour.

Ar: Cooked squash/pumpkin, toffee, burnt sugar, nutmeg
Ap: Deep orange-amber pour, no head, no lace.
T: Cooked squash/pumpkin, pie spice (especially nutmeg), rum finish, very sweet.  Almost cloying, but not quite.
P: Creamy, highly sticky thick palate.

O: Fantastic experiment by Avery.  It was probably served around 45F, and it really opened up as the beer warmed.  This can be sipped like a liqueur, and I enjoyed it immensely.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","spilledpint"
59,"2010-10-24",4.1,"On tap at the brewery.  Outstanding aroma; just as advertised, it smells like pumpkin pie with a shot of rum.  Mouthfeel is sticky, and a bit cloying, but appropriate for the style, I think.  Despite the ""rummy"" taste, the alcohol is not overwhelming.  This is a pleasant sipper and would be perfect on a cold winters day.  A shame that its not available in a bottle.  It would be perfect as a holiday gift.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AlexK"
59,"2010-10-20",4.6,"the smell is amazing.  Its a super sweet pumpkin pie/rum punch in the nose.  Dark copper color, thin head, low carbonation.  Oh, my , god!  I am in love (nobody tell my wife) this is an amazing beer.  Thick on the palate.  Just enough sweetness that it balances the malts and alcohol perfectly.  The flavor is punpkin pie with a snifter of rum.  Even if you didnt know it was aged in rum barrels, youd know.  Great beer.","California, USA","bigbish"
59,"2010-10-17",4.6,"On tap @ Avery Brewery. Thick white bubbly head sits atop a coppery orange hued beer. Smell is straight forward yet enticing: pumpkin pie and dark rum. Taste is Oh! So sweet!  Tastes primarily like a liquid pumpkin pie, grahm cracker crust and all.  All accompanied by subtle nutmeg and very un-subtle rum, especially in the finish where it is warm and sweet, as any cold-weather drink should be. Almost too sweet, but just almost. This is an awesome beer that everyone outside the Denver/Boulder area should lament about never getting to try, since Avery promised to never bottle it.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
59,"2010-10-17",3.9,"Draught at Avery. Clear ruby amber with small white head. Aroma has lots of pumpkin spice action, all-spice, strong sweet rum backbone, pretty boozy smelling but not a surprise. Taste is explosive pumpkin pie, medium spice, sweet throughout but not overly so. Rum gets stronger as brew warms, though booze is well hidden. Really tasty, a damn fine pumpkin ale.","Denver, Colorado, USA","potbeerjob"
59,"2010-10-14",3.9,"On Draft @ Averys release party. Great aroma of pumpkin and spices. Warms up nicely with a  sticky vanilla backbone and rum flavors throughout.

A must sipper from the get go as the sweet candied yam notes are just a bit too sugary for me. Best with a water-back. Nice carbonation and yeasty/carmel finish.  Not a bad pumpkin brew","Denver, Colorado, USA","Doodler"
59,"2010-10-14",4.2,"On tap at Avery poured a clear dark orange amber with a small lingering amber head. Aromas of rum, pumpkin, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, light vanilla, light clove and a hint of oak. Palate was medium bodied and smooth with a warming finish. Flavors of rum, pumpkin, vanilla, allspice, nutmeg, , light clove, light carmel and a hint of oak with a smooth lingering spiced rum finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
59,"2010-10-09",4.2,"A: The pour is a dark amber color with a fingers worth of off-white head.

S: A wonderful aroma on this beer. Tons of spices, namely cinnamon, all spice, and ginger, are immediately noticeable. The rum/barrel adds plenty of oak and vanilla as well as alcohol. A pretty decent pumpkin smell, too.

T: The pumpkin flavor in this beer is unlike any other Ive come across. Legitimate fleshy, meaty pumpkin flavor that is complimented by the spice character. The rum helps to enhance the spiciness as well as providing some vanilla and alcohol warmth.

M: The body is medium with a smooth creamy carbonation.

D: This is one beer that is a little bit boozy, but it does not suffer from this characteristic. Amazing flavor and the nose is almost as good.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
59,"2010-10-08",3.2,"Big rum aroma off of this. Really powerful, to the point of being near whiskey like. Pumpkin spices come through but actual gourd not so much. Slightly out of balance.","Glendale, California, USA","beersearcher"
59,"2010-10-08",4.3,"On tap at Avery night at Blue Palms. Aroma is absolutely fantastic! Huge woody, rum aroma. Dry, pumpkin pie spices. Ginger. Tannins, caramel. My words cannot do justice. This is seriously one of the best smelling beers that I have ever had. Flavors are huge, candied yam, cinnamon, nutmeg, sweet rum. Great! Still very well attenuated. Vanilla frosting. Tannins. Oily mouthfeel. Creamy. Excellent!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
