Both 750 ml. bottles sampled @ ZZT 2016-1.Apricot: Very hazy orange, fizzing away white head. Nose is big aspirin sourness, sour medicine, basic lactic & vinegar sourness, some fruity apricot in the back. Taste is aspirin sour upfront, puckering, vinegar, basic lactic sour, lots of aspirin, Sour, vinegar. There is fruity apricot in the back. Very simple, overly heavy on vinegar & aspirin sourness. Okay but I have had definitely better from De Garde. 3.7/5 Peach: Quite similar. Super milky orange with no head. Smell is once again massive sour puckering aspirin, overly lactic, low vinegar, fruit is barely present here. Taste is also very sour puckering vinegar, aspirin, lemon juice, basic lactic, Puckering & low carbonation. Fruit is less present here & barely there.

Smell is fruity and tiny phenolic with crackers, lemon juice, ripe peaches, yoghurt, minerals,lemon zest and hints of rubber. Taste is sour and fruity. mouthfeel is dry, tart and medium bodied.

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate-heavy peach with a hint of lemon. It pours a hazy golden-orange with minimal white head that is really just a very fine ring. The flavor starts with a quick dose of sweet peach. It quickly turns moderate-heavy sour peaches, lemon, and a hint of must. Its light bodied with moderate-lively carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3910,"2015-08-09",4.1,"750 ml. Peaches. Lots of juicy peaches, Im talking an unbelievable amount of peach flavor with out seeming artificial. Touch of lactic sour. Perfectly balanced. Had this next to the non imperial version. Almost the same although I think this had a bit less peach flavor but a fuller body. Both amazing.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
3910,"2015-08-09",3.7,"Fast gone, very white head over fully hazy yellow beer with a faint greenish sheen. Peach, milkchocolate (something like Cadbury flakes), citrus, lemon. Sour, unripe peaches and dried apricots after some time. Lipsmacking acidity, aptly light body. Quite good, surprising. Only Americans... including the Imperial tag!!","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
3910,"2015-05-15",4.0,"Bottle thanks to Ben! 
Aroma is fairly peach forward with a faint oak note. Some light citrus notes with some lactic acid. really very peach forward. Faint malt character. 
Pours a hazy, murky, golden orange with a medium sized, thin, white head that quickly disappears. No lacing and faint legs. 
Flavor is rather acidic with some citrus notes including lemon and orange. Light wheat presence. No bitterness. Medium high peach character that is somehow able to punch through all the acidity. Faint oak. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, I kind of like this more than some of the other fruited bus as the peach is soft enough to let the character of the base bu shine through. Acidity seems less sharp than in some of the berry bus too.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3910,"2015-05-02",4.4,"Bottle - thanks Felipe! Pours cloudy peach/amber, small white head, nice lacing. Aroma is pure peaches; as somebody said, I can smell the hairs. I have never smelled a more peach forward beer. Flavor is medium plus tart, huge fruity peach presence. Medium body, thick in the mouth. Really amazing.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3910,"2015-04-28",4.1,"Poured a cloudy orangeish peach color with aromas of sour oak, light vinegar, apricots and some hay. Flavors are sour apricots and tart wheat. Light and enjoyable could drink a lot of this in one sitting not over the top sour but enough with some apricot funkiness.","Florida, USA","burg326"
3910,"2015-04-25",4.2,"Dave, your review rocks-in some ways literally. A- pours a cloudy apricot with a very thin white head that dissipates very quickly. S- dirty peach skins overrides all. Apricot, lemon juice, grapefruit, white grapes and a little vinegar. Some mustiness. A little bit of green apple core. M- light to medium acidic body with good carb. T- tartness burns the the palette at first. Strong apricot and peach skins again. Beautiful. Grapefruit and critic acids. Some lactic acids as wells. Some cheese clip and sour cream. Endings dry with sharp minerals and a light chalk. Fully enjoyable.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"

3910,"2015-04-10",3.7,"Bottle from a trade. Pour is cloudy to murky deep yellow to orange. small white head that dies quickly. Nose is a slightly sweaty, musty, funkiness. Light to moderate fuzzy fruit aroma underneath. Taste is immediately puckering but not overly so such that it completely detracts from the fruit and beer. Flavor reveals some light lemon as well. After you get past the sourness, the fruitiness is quite pleasant. overall, pretty damn tasty.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
3910,"2015-03-21",4.2,"Bottle thanks to Chow. Pours a cloudy yellow with small frothy white head that lasts. The aroma is strong peach and faint oak. Thin mouth, peach puree, nice sourness, light oak, really enjoyed this one.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"

3910,"2015-01-24",4.2,"Bottle thanks to Casey, cheers! Pours an opaque glowing orange juice color with one inch of head that fizzles away quickly. Beautiful beer. Aroma is really nice: peach skin, dried peaches, fruit leather, SweeTarts, faint berry, lemon peel, oak, light white wine. Tart and appetizing. Taste is sour apricot, grapefruit juice, dried peach, grain, citric but with a nice sweet-tart balance. Not as aggressively sour as some other De Gardes. My favorite Bu thus far along with Cherry Raz, and superior to regular Apricot, I think.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","dfroms"
3910,"2015-01-18",4.4,"Movin to the country,
gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin to the country,
Gonna eat me a lot of peaches
Movin to the country,
gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin to the country,
gonna eat a lot of peaches

Peaches come from a can,
they were put there by a man
In a factory downtown
If I had my little way,
Id eat peaches every day
Sun-soakin bulges in the shade

Take a little nap where the roots all twist
Squished a rotten peach in my fist
And dreamed about you, woman,
I poked my finger down inside
Make a little room for an ant to hide
Natures candy in my hand or can or a pie

Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free

Look out!","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
3910,"2014-12-31",4.2,"750mL bottle, pours a cloudy golden yellow with a small white head. Nose brings out fragrant fresh peaches, with low-to-medium tartness. Flavour is so juicy, with loads of fresh juicy peaches, light tartness, and more fresh juicy peachiness. Just enough tartness to make it seem like a berliner, though the peachy juiciness makes this wonderfully drinkable.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
