4082,"2016-06-27",4.2,"As Boon To Be Wild, six year old keg at Belgium Chimipalooza. Exceptionally strong old lambic with, due to refermentation in the keg, an egg-white, moussy head and misty amberish orange blonde colour. Complex, funky and (as is typical for old lambic) restrained aroma of sour plum, unripe gooseberry, stale sweat, wet wood, old sherry, moldy lemon, sourdough, dry white wine, bitter orange. Soft, complexely estery onset, very fruity, lactic tartness with a thin and subdued lemony edge, gooseberry and green plum flavors, sherryish, soapy wheat and bready barley backbone, soft and creamy mouthfeel, vinous, drying wood in the end with, in spite of the ABV which is huge for a lambic, well-hidden alcohol. Great and impressive lambic in every sense, very noble and artistocratic in its old character and distinguished restraint, glad I got a chance to sample this.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

4082,"2011-01-02",3.9,"Draught at Mikkeller Bar, Copenhagen, as Boon to be WildHazy amber color, with a distinctive fine perlage. The aroma is very wild indeed, also pervasive, full and fulfilling, moldy cellar, with old timber beams and barrels...The body is strong and quite round, with malt and strong Bretts flavor; there is some residual sweetness, and a light fruity touch; also a very nice vinous touch; the sourness is not aggressive. There is also some alcohol presence, and this is probably the only note out of tune here.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
4082,"2010-12-17",4.4,"A Mes rate. Tap at the amazing Brasserie 4:20A superb looking straight lambic. Slightly hazy solid gold body with a perfect lick of a white head. This is just about the best straight lambic Ive had. I cant believe its 10%. Its so soft yet punishingly sharp at the same time. My god, I could get messy on this, like really quickly. There is an amazing hit of something that I can only describe as strawberries and cream. Huge kick of aggressive sourness in the initial flavour, a big warm cuddle in the finish. This is a stellar beer. Easy the best from Boon. Looking at the rest of the rates either I am mental or this is much better than it has been elsewhere. Amazing.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

Medium carbonation, light and mildly dry palate. Flavour is soft, tart, some apples, light warming. But thats all I feel of the high ABV. Oaky and kinda earthy bitterness. Long, oaky and dry finish.
