2684,"2017-05-24",4.3,"5400th review! 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass; 2017 vintage, bottled on 12/7/2016. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red/light copper/brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, cream, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, brown bread, and nuttiness; with lighter notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, raisin, cherry, fig, date, and oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/light roasted malts and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Very minimal booziness in the aromas as it warms. Taste of huge caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, cream, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, brown bread, and nuttiness; with lighter notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, raisin, cherry, fig, date, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/woody bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, cream, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, brown bread, nuttiness, light chocolate/dark fruit, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitter/spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy/tannic, and lightly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden; a small pleasant warmth with mild barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged imperial brown ale! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and easy to sip on for the huge ABV. Perfectly balanced malt and barrel flavors. Great complexity and nicely rich, without being too heavy for the style. Very similar to an American barelywine, but more roasty like a brown ale. Great barrel presence without being overly boozy, tannic, or drying. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Dark fruit, red vines, oaky (adds borderline astringent element to this). Decadent dessert beer, this is almost too much. More than almost.

Had been wanting to try this and this was the first time I saw it on tap (or maybe even in stores). Kind of crazy that I was having it in Fort Collins instead of San Diego, but oh well. Expecting good things like all of their other big boozy beers. Rather quick review. 

Poured a reddish brown amber murky color with 1-to-2 fingers of khaki white head. Light bubbles coming up underneath. Good lacing. Very good retention. (Sight - 3.75)

Smelled boozy creamy bourbon, toffee, caramel, oak, vanilla, buttery malts and Heaven Hill whiskey (thank you Helldorado). (Smell - 4.50)

Tasted boozy bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, tobacco and leather. A tad hot. Would love to sit on a bottle of this. (Taste - 4.25)

Medium body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, warming boozy finish. (Feel - 4.50)

Pours a deep mahogany brown color with a finger of khaki fizz. Nose is layered brown sugar, vanilla, creme brulee, graham crackers and soft bourbon.

2684,"2017-03-10",4.5,"Poured into a snifter, the appearance was a semi-transparent ruddy dark brown looking color with no head nor lace.
The aroma had a wonderful blend of sweet toasty malts - subtle bourbon/woodiness, a touch of vanilla, smooth caramel to toffee blissful malts and a touch of tobacco. Sly earthiness at the end.
The flavor melds the sweet to the earthiness in a super smooth manner encasing the woodiness to the backdrop and evenly lets it all blend on into the aftertaste to roll right into a nice semi-sticky sort of finish.
On the palate, this one sat about medium bodied with a fine sipping quality about it. Somewhat low carbonation but that just seems to allow the woodiness to dryly tame the gathering of the smoothness on my tongue.
Overall, a superb English strong ale, I say. DoesnÂ’t seem hoppy enough to be American styled, still, IÂ’m not arguing on this fine gem of a beer. A true late WinterÂ’s sipper sure to please the maltheads.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

I donÂ’t much care for bourbon - sticky-sweet sickly stuff for sugarbabes who canÂ’t handle Scotch - so IÂ’m all in favour of anything that involves replacing the contents of a bourbon barrel with something else. This will do just fine. Firestone Walker Bravo Barrel Aged Brown Ale (snappy title) is as brown and clear as the previous contents of the barrel with a skimpy corona of suds. It smells piercingly alcoholic - turpentine wood, demorara sugar and tokay. Oily, spiritous mouthfeel. Big licks of vanilla and oak on the tongue, burnt sugars and a huge alcohol burn in the swallow. ItÂ’s a sipper that would sit well with a cold night, a fireplace, a bull session and no rush to get up next morning. Quality stuff.

2684,"2007-12-16",4.3,"Its hard to believe this is a brown ale. The only thing similar I have had is Hakusekikan Brown Ale, which is equally as nice IMO. Dark brown color, molassess, brown sugar, truffles, caramel, brandy and milk chocolate come off the nose. The mouth reminded me of a top notch espresso with ample caramel syrup and frangelico, dusted with cinammon. Slight oaky character that doesnÂ’t add or distract.  Cinammon chocolately finish. Amazing.  Age has helped this beer. Alcohol is not noticable at all.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"

2684,"2007-05-29",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2011 Unwittingly poured a sample of this knowing only that it was oak aged and a brown ale. I guess the oak aging should have alerted me to the fact that this was probably going to be a high alcohol beer! But geez did I get a shock! This is one heavy malty beer. Deep bronze colour, very viscous. Thick mouthfeel, butter, vanilla, caramel, malt, brown sugar, oak, oak and more oak. A very overpowering palate, definately needs to be served at warmer temperature, possibly has too much carbonation for something so heavy. A very interesting beer but I feel the oak is over done. I imagine it would age well.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Linc"
2684,"2007-04-15",3.5,"On tap at the 10th Annual San Diego Strong Ale Festival: Pours a transparent dark copper with a nice, frothy, wispy-lacing tan head.  Aroma of caramel bourbon and a touch of buttered popcorn and vanilla.  Body starts sweet and with a good amount of dark caramel and toasty bourbon oak toward a slightly warming, nicely-balanced finish.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
2684,"2007-04-11",4.1,"Triple Rock Gravity Firkin Fest.  Deep amber/ brown color with an ivory head.  Chocolate and bourbon aromas.  BIG chocolate flavors- like a candy bar in a glass.  Somewhat lactic and hot.  Tons of bourbon.  Lingering chocolate/ musty finish.  A nice Barley Wine.","Concord, California, USA","ChillCoat"
2684,"2007-02-07",4.0,"10th Annual SD Strong Ale Fest:  Poured a slightly hazed dark chestnut color with a small tan head.  Decent aroma of vanilla, mild bourbon and toasted malt.  The flavor had bourobon as well, along with vanilla, toasted malt, butterscotch (but not in the diacetyl way) and some browned fruits.  Semi-dry finish.  Mild bitterness.  Very nice.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
2684,"2007-02-04",4.2,"on tap at the SD strong ale fest 06.  lots of carmel, brown sugar, molasses, alongside some vanilla, carmel ,and some wood and nuts.  decently mellow.  probably my fave of the fest","Marietta, Ohio, USA","LilKem"
2684,"2007-01-03",4.0,"Tasted on tap at the 2006 Pizza Port Strong Ale Fest. This brown ale pours a medium brown color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is brown sugar, caramel and bourbon. A medium to full bodied brown ale. Malts are caramel, brown sugar, molasses and vanilla. Lots of bourbon flavors. Some wood. Some of the brown ale character, but the malts are somewhat overwhelmed by the barrel flavors. A very interesting beer, a nice meld of malts and wood and barrel aging. Hides the alcohol well. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
2684,"2006-12-02",4.1,"This was probably my favorite beer at the San Diego Strong Ale Fest. It pours clear dark reddish brown color. The flavor starts out roasty like a brown ale but the sweetness of barrel aging takes over and it finishes brown sugar sweet. Very nicely done","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
