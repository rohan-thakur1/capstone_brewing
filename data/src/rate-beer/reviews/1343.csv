1343,"2013-10-06",3.5,"A very nice scotch style ale. Pours a very nice dark red. Smells like bourbon. Taste is very sweet up front, with a smokiness and a bourbon, but not boozy finish. Very interesting. Had on tap at the brewery.

1343,"2012-05-23",3.8,"A - Served a clear red with just a touch of orange mixed in and a thin finger of frothy slightly off-white head. Head fades slowly with some good lace.

S - Aroma is a mix of rich sweet caramel malts with a touch of earthy hops coming through.

T - Starts off some rich sweet caramel malt with a bit of a syrupy taste. Through the middle a bit of earthy hop comes through with some more caramel malt. The finish is a mix of rich caramel malt sweetness with some light bitterness.

M - Medium-plus bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with a lightly syrupy feeling and a sweet and lightly warming finish.

D - Very drinkable. Fairly rich and sweet, but still well balanced and not overbearing.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"

1343,"2011-11-07",3.3,"8 ounce sample on tap at the brewpub.  Very sweet caramelly aroma with some hints of peat.  Light roastiness, and minimal smoke present.  Nicely aromatic.  Transparent garnet-amber body with a medium off-yellowish head and good lacing.  Starts sweet, sticky, and caramelly.  Becomes a bit peaty and a little smoked in the middle.  Some buttery diacetyl seems present late, which is mildly off-putting.  Long-lasting roastiness late.  Scantly burnt.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
1343,"2011-05-07",3.8,"Pours amber with an off white head. The aroma is very smoky and grainy with a touch of peated malt. The flavor is nice with smoke and caramel. Very silky and smooth on the palate. The finish is smoky and and bitter with  a touch of roasted malt. Big flavor and mouthfeel for a smaller beer. A nice treat for Scottish ale lovers.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
1343,"2011-05-05",3.5,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours with a mostly clear amber hued body with a small, off-white head. Aromas are malty, lightly smokey, raisins, caramel, bready and slightly sweet. Clean, no hop aromas or fermentation character. Flavors are lightly smokey, raisiny, and caramel. Very noticeably bitter for the style. A bit too much, but still enjoyable (ratings are not to style anyway). Medium bubbles, smooth finish.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

The sweetness isnt so bad, but I think they should try barrel aging some of this. Decent overall.","Berkeley, California, USA","Aquilo"

The modest aroma emits sweet malts mixed with ripe cherries, caramel malts and a touch of resiny hop grassiness. The taste is sweet with malts along with thin layers of ripe cherries, sweet raisins and caramel malts. Smooth tasty brew.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

1343,"2009-07-05",3.3,"Tap at the brewpub.  Nose is very metallic with grains.  Color is redder than I think of the style being but I may be overly restrictive there.  Flavor is missing some peat for my taste, and is both thinner and short-finishing than the best of the style (AleSmith, Founders) seem to be.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"

1343,"2008-08-18",4.1,"Minimal head, though well made.  The bitterness level is fantastic, as well is the mouth-feel.  Very pleased with the dryness which also makes for the well hidden 7% alcohol.  They were out of their IPA, but this was my favorite of five when I was there.","USA","Nik925"
1343,"2008-05-21",3.1,"Poured from tap at Triple rock brewing a clear brown with a small off white head.  Aroma was soft with wood, caramel, and barnyard funk(hay, straw).  The flavor had a bit of hay, toast, soft caramel, some wood, and malt.  The palate is not very sweet and mildly bitter.  Just didnt have a whole lot of flavor, rather bland or maybe just didnt pair well with what I was eating.  Ill have to go back and try without food.","El Cerrito, California, USA","rayOfBeer"
1343,"2008-01-17",4.0,"Draft from cask.  Beautiful, lasting tan head on this bronze beer. Aroma bready, with floral tones as well. Buttery, smooth mouthfeel, with creamy & soft bubbles. Tasted quite different from Tree Frog Ale- a bit sharper, in fact.  I enjoyed!Earlier Rating: 11/20/2007 Total Score: 3.1Floral & sweet at first taste, becoming less sweet, almost dry, towards the end.  A bit hoppier than I had expected, with some spicy end notes.  Thin mouth feel,  medium carbonation, no head whatsoever.  Strong alcohol flavors balanced by fruitiness in some swallows.  I ate this w/ a decent chicken sandwich & slaw, which may have affected some of my experience...","SF Bay area, California, USA","elelwarren"
1343,"2007-11-11",3.3,"On draft at the brewpub (7.6%). Deep roasted malt aroma with a touch of smoke. Very dark amber color with a minimal beige head. Medium body and very mild carbonation. Dark roasted flavor with no real sign of hop. The finish is a bit sweet, balanced only by the roasted aspect.
