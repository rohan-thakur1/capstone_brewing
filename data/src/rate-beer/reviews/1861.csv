Also some hops, mix of floral and citrus, distinguishable Saaz. The taste is medium to light heavy sweet, almost medium bitter. Also quite a lot of sediment floating around. Fizzy carbonation makes for some belching. The higher ABV is clearly noticeable though not unpleasant, good drinkability. The finish is light sweet, light bitter, hoppy. Definitely a good beer.","Bratislava, SLOVAK REPUBLIC","Gurthnar"

1861,"2012-06-07",3.8,"Bottle. Golden with a big and frothy head. Aroma is strongly bready malty, very hoppy for this style, with citrus, oranges and cammomille. Now, that is interesting! The taste is less sweet than expected, there is some alcoholic astringency but it blends in nicely with the strong bitterness, and both are balanced by the full malty body. Herbal and citrusy aftertaste. I had some cross-stylistic thoughts, as the taste profile (alcoholic + bitter vs. sweet) reminded me somewhat of a slightly less bitter Imperial IPA, while the orangey aroma of a Tripel. Either way, Adam Matuska has managed the unthinkable - a light bock beer that I enjoyed very much!","Mikołów, POLAND","ElDesmadre"
