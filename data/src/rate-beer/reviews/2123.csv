2123,"2008-07-28",3.5,"Cask, handpull, Smithfield Derby. As Half Man Half Biscuit almost sang, there is nothing better in life than writing on the sole of your slipper with a Biro on a Thursday night instead of going to the pub unless it’s the Smithfield and you have to choose between Thornbridge, Oakham and Whim. The answer’s obvious - have the Inferno and Kipling later and enjoy Flower Power first. As orange clears to rugged gold, hop oil escapes the oversize glass. Like an overstocked market stall, the sharp citrics and soft flowers occasionally struggle for attention but on the whole the beer works - and works hard at balance to be a winner. Great on its own, better as a palate-loosener for the other goodies often on at the Smithy.","Derby, Derbyshire, ENGLAND","haddonsman"
