873,"2013-06-17",3.8,"300 ml Bottle from Isetan. First time to see a little bottle from them. Dusty nose, rice and koji, pepper and spice. Citrus. Smooth, estery flavor, medium sweetness, stewed peaches, light caramel and vanilla, pepper, rice, cream. Round and fruity with a prickly, alcohol finish. Very mellow as a result of aging, but maybe that makes it lack the spunk their sakes usually have. Very good, not quite great.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
