2692,"2017-03-04",3.3,"Too big a bastard for me, I guess. Double Bastards a hoss to begin with, and Charred is like DB on steroids. So much massive malt heaviness...oof. Thick as syrup, gooey, chunky, chewy, bad on the eyes but better on the nose, boozy and foreboding. Starts sweet, stays sweet: brown sugar, toffee bars, molasses, pancake syrup, maybe a little white chocolate and pepper, then blasts you with oak and hops, only to have the hops drop off and the oak go fucking nuts. Finish is bittersweet and clingy, whiskey heat waving a flare through the malty sea. (Bad metaphor, I know. Im tired.) Fades with more oak than a furniture store. Too rich for my wimpy blood.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

I didnt think the Templeton Rye Barrel Aged version of Double Bastard was particularly better than regulation Double Bastard. But this... this is really something noteworthy. This beer looks like Double Bastard on the pour, its dark caramel brown with little head. The aroma is just gorgeous. It smells like Double Bastard, but has huge, warm, buttery bourbon character. Vanilla, spice, rich and woody and strong. The flavor is bigger and bolder still. Its complex and rich and absolutely delicious. Nutty, toasted, sweet and strong, with burnt sugar and earthy, ochre notes. The finish is spacious and warm, and the big blast of the ABV hits the nose like a ghost train.

2692,"2017-01-05",4.5,"Bought this as Southern Charred 2016, which is Arrogant Bastards bourbon barrel-aged barley wine (basically their Double Bastard Ale under a different name). Corked big bottle poured into a snifter. Appearance is murky and hazy, as if its apple cider thats been shaken before pouring. No head or lacing. Aroma is musty old ale with whiffs of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, smokiness from the bourbon barrel, and a slight tannic, acidic scent. The flavor is all of the above  on steroids  followed by a balancing hop bitterness and the boozy burn of its 12.6 percent-alcohol. Mouthfeel is syrupy with almost no carbonation.

2692,"2015-12-25",3.7,"January 24th, 2014 - Folks in San Diego are going crazy for this expensive trio of beers, and the chili pepper permutation was a shock and a bust, to both the palate and the wallet. The Charred is a marked improvement, and while it is not an overly complex brew, it bears all the marks and heralds of Stone Brewing, and is almost as iconic as Arrogant Bastard itself. It pours like stirred up mud, the color of a dark, black tea, and a thin head colored with a touch of auburn. The aroma is surprisingly quiet, given all the boasting in the marketing and on the label, though when I do go in for a sniff I get slapped with an oak chip. But its a welcome slap, bringing out a deep, heady smoky wood smell, combined with that distinctive stone scent so often found in their amber beers (and everything darker on the color spectrum.) The most noticeable aspect of the flavor is a soft, velvet palate, with loosens up around the mid-taste, and ends with a foamy flourish. The flavors are mostly in the oak family, with a booziness swimming around at every stage. The oak touches balance deftly with the hops and malt bill in a compelling way, and better represents the arrogance of Stones style than their headline brew. As it warms, a deeper Maillard reaction richness develops in the flavor, as well as a more three dimensional hop profile. It doesnt get more complex than this, but it does stay bold and strong through the whole of the evolution. That, in conjunction with the iconic flavors, make this a good investment and a fine - and slow sipping - beer.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

2692,"2015-08-12",3.1,"2013 bottling; Sampled February 2014
A steady pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a one finger thick, amber tinged, tan colored head. The beer is a dark, concentrated amber color that shows a richly hazy, red-amber hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells tart, of vanilla, toasted coconut, with some rich buttery oak notes, and lots of warming, spicy, Bourbon fruit character and alcohol.

Slightly sweet, perhaps a touch of Bourbon tartness, and a finish that is quite oak influenced with a mix of rich, buttery, toasted coconut and vanillin character. Bitter hop notes have mellowed quite a bit, but are still quite present and help to balance the rich malt and sweet accentuating Bourbon notes; the bitterness gets a bit more firm in the finish where it combines with a bit of hot alcohol. Fruit notes of concentrated plum, and a touch of fig, as well as lots of fruit leaning Bourbon notes. Rich, definitely a sipping brew, though the barrel aging lightens the beer up just a bit.

Beers with a strong Bourbon barrel influence just arent my thing in the end; this is enjoyable in small amounts, and the Bourbon heat can get to be a bit too much after a bit.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Pours a deep red color, almost flat... but not perfectly still 

The aroma is only lightly boozy but offered toffee & apple mostly, its bourbony & defiantly sweet smelling, but inviting and enjoyable all the same. 

The flavor is only lightly bitter with a tinge of that caramel malt on piney hop that I just dont like about the ""Bastards"", this element is actually so minor that it serves as a sort of pleasantry as opposed to a general annoyance that I find it to be in basically every other beer in this family. Its loaded with toffee flavor, vanilla, burnt sugar, brown sugar, & Bourbon. 

The palate is mouth coating and the extremely low carbonation seems to fit just fine here. 

It almost pains me to rate something from the ""Bastard"" line this high as I have very little regard for Arrogant Bastard or any of the takes on it, but this is something else completely... the beer that emerged from those barrels was transformed from the beer that went in...

Aroma of vanilla, oak barrel, toffee, caramel, and some grapefruit citrus hops still holding on despite the age. Medium bodied with lively bubbly carbonation despite being 3 years old and barrel aged. Flavor of vanilla bourbon, wood, burnt caramel/toffee, slight hop bitterness and a good dose alcohol. Nice but this one drank very hot from the bourbon aging.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
2692,"2008-11-29",3.9,"Broubon barrel aged Double Bastard 06, at the 08 double bastard release.  Pours a deep reddish brown, with very thin head.  The bourbon is reserved, and almost muted.  Strong caramel malts, mollasses, oak, vanilla, earthiness, and some bitter hops still hanging in there.  The mouthfeel is soft and syrupy.  Very good, but the french oak barrel was better.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
2692,"2008-02-08",3.8,"2004 Bourbon Barrel Aged Double Bastard Ale on-tap at Double Bastard Ale Night at the Stone Brewery. Pours an almost clear, reddish brown color. No head, only a few large bubbles. Smells of bourbon and oak. Tastes of bourbon and oak as well. Also tastes of sweet malts. A little hop spiciness buried under all of that as well. Totally flat, which is a bummer because this brew really does taste good. Brew is thick but it feels thin with the lack of carbonation. Great barrel-aged beer. I just wish it had carbonation.","San Diego, California, USA","doubleo"

2692,"2007-12-01",4.5,"On tap at Stones 2007 Double Bastard Night.  Listed as 2004 Bourbon Barrel.  No head, except for huge bubbles from pour.  Bourbon is present in araom, but not overpowering.  Nice bitter/sweetness balance, but leans sweet.  Very, very delicious.  Double Bastard is one of my favorite beers.  I have been collecting and aging these.  I now have 04,05,06, and 07.  Tasted with kp, eyedrinkale, oodeftone (on BA), and darkelf.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
2692,"2007-11-29",3.9,"Wow, its been a while since anyone has rated this one. Not sure if its the same batch, but had it on tap at Stone brewery/bistro. 2004 Bourbon Barrel Double Bastard during Double Bastard night, Nov.29 2007. Hazy copper color with no head, quite flat but wreaking with bourbon whiskey notes, sticky malt, cinnamon and hops. 3 years of age have mellowed it out a lot, and the presence of oak is noticeable. Slightly syrupy mouthfeel, like brandy, with the hops still putting on the bitterness at each sip. Highly enjoyable.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"
2692,"2005-08-22",4.2,"Hell ya, i was at the strong ale fest 04, i sampled some of this fine beer during my journey of drunkeness. All i can say is big, this beer was huge, it had a body like a lineman and an attitude like... Just really huge, definite kick up from the double.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
2692,"2005-05-06",3.1,"Sampled at Strong Ale Fest 2004. Didnt enter the rating sooner due to the fact I didnt think it would be considererd a seperate beer. To much goign on here. A beer that was already pretty extreme is pushed over the edge by the whiskey barrel aging. Over the top hops bludgeoned by harsh bourbon notes with oakiness that would be overbearing in any beer but this. Put this under MAYBe try again.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
2692,"2004-12-30",4.4,"Strong Ale 04. One of my top 3 beers at the fest. This stuff was lightly oaked, silky smooth and oh so tasty. Rich honey taste and lightly hopped. Im hoping this will be the 05 3L, hint.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
2692,"2004-12-11",4.0,"Tasted at the 2004 Pizza Port Strong Ale Fest. Whisky amber color. Small to no head, Aroma is brown sugar, caramel, whiskey and oak. A medium to full bodied American Strong Ale. Malts are caramel and brown sugar. Orange peel and citrus, some oak. Thick and oily mouthfeel. In other words in tastes like Double bastard that has had some oak aging. Interesting beer, but I think I like the non-aged stuff better. Although I wouldnt mind have a few bottles of this stuff to cellar for a while. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
2692,"2004-12-08",4.0,"This beer was sampled at the San Diego Strong Ale Festival 2004. This beer was the first one I ran to at the fest. It poured a reddish dark brown color with a very small pearlish white head and minor lacing. The aroma is oakey, malty, with some tangy orange, alcohol, and slight whiskey. The flavor has some heavy orange/citrus and hard alcohol with a heavy dose of caramel and malt in the finish. Strangely enough well balanced and smooth. Medium mouthfeel with some brown sugar toward mid-sip. It had some obvious wood qualities as it warmed and it definitely had some fairly active carbonation. This was a well rounded solid beer, but call me crazy..I enjoyed the regular aged Double Bastard more.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"
2692,"2004-12-06",4.2,"On tap @ the San Diego Strong Ale Fest. Poured a medium to a dark brownish color with a very small off white head. Flavors and tastes of sweet (almost brown sugary), citrus (oranges) and of course Whiskey. Woody. Whiskey stronger in the taste than the smell. I enjoyed this much more than the regular Double Bastard.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
2692,"2004-12-05",4.2,"The nose was really nice consisting of smokey, honey, whiskey, and malt.  The pour was rich golden brown w/ hints of red and orange.  The head was minor and almost no lacing.  Big whiskey and woody flavors w/ hints of honey sweetness and citrus undertones.  Creamy, medium body and little effervescence on the back of the tongue.","San Diego, California, USA","Hairofthedog"
