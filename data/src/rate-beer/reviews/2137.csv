Aroma is quite smoky, burnt wood, ash, coniferous, slight meat, caramel, slight vanilla, sweet grapes. Flavour hits initially with slight smoke and wood, the sweetens with brown sugar, sweet grapes like brandy or fortified wine, before moderate bitterness from wood, conifer bittering, moderate smoke, tannic black tea and soft fruitiness in the smoky aftertaste. Medium bodied with low carbonation. Really rather an oddball, but its certainly a very interesting drink and tasty in smaller portions.

2137,"2015-10-25",4.6,"Geproefd tijdens Borefts 2015, van de tap in De Molen proefglas. Amber/oranje achtig bier met een snel wegtrekkende beige schuimkraag, en een licht koolzuurgehalte. Eerste bier van Närke wat ik ooit heb geproefd. Prachtig verhaal ook van de brouwer van Närke over dit bier, over het snijden van de jonge takken van de jeneverbes.
Ik ben gelijk enthousiast, erg speciaal, zowel in aroma als smaak. 
Rokerig en kruidig aroma van jeneverbes, en kruiden uit de Zweedse bossen. Heel bosachtig, aardachtig en houtig van aroma, met tonen van: jeneverbes, kastanjes, beukennootjes, hout, mos, leer, champignons, en een iets muffige bosgeur, als van vochtige herfstbladeren. Moeilijk te omschrijven maar absoluut erg bijzonder. Het smaakpallet is ook speciaal, met tonen van karamel, walnoot, kastanje en aardachtige tonen van paddestoelen en turf met een gerookte subtiele balans erin. De afdronk is lang en medium bitter en wederom heel kruidig. Dit is nu zo'n bier dat ik onmiddellijk zou kopen mocht ik het ergens kunnen vinden, een boswandeling in een bier. Alleen zijn de bieren van Närke heel zeldzaam buiten Zweden helaas. Wellicht volgend jaar weer tijdens Borefts.

2137,"2015-09-29",3.9,"At Borefts, thanks to 77ships for sharing. Very interesting style-wise, as this is apparently intended by the brewery as a bottom-fermented pale Doppelbock hybridized with Gotlandsdricka, the ancient spice beer from Götland. Head was already lost, colour was a hazy amber. Strongly but pleasantly phenolic aroma, pine resin (or, more likely, juniper twigs), caramel, roasted peanut, green tea, chestnuts; sweetish, caramelly taste without being cloying, smooth and resinous mouthfeel, toasted accent, phenolic and somewhat smoky finish (apparently a typical trait of Gotlandsdricka), some warming, gin-like alcohol, herbal but very subtle hoppiness and lingering caramelly malts. One of the most interesting beers I had at Borefts, certainly in terms of style. Närke does not disappoint...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
