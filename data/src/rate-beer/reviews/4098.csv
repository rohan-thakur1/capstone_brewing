4098,"2016-04-09",2.7,"Draft at the RateBeer Best Festival 2016. Pours clear gold with a slight, foamy white head. The aroma has a prominent plastic off note, along with grass and lemon. Light sweet flavour, somewhat tangy, with more plastic, hay. Light bodied with average carbonation. Dry and lightly grassy on the finish, with more mild plastic, lemon rind. There seems to be a phenolic issue here. Not great overall.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
4098,"2016-03-04",1.3,"On tap @ RateBer Best 2016. Golden beer with minimal carbonation or foam. Smells like raw cereal grains and malt to start followed by a lot of burnt rubber and rubber cement. Minimal carbonation, incredibly slick mouthfeel, and some lemon juice. Big time chlorophenolic character here that is not pleasant. I dont know what everyone else is smoking (or maybe what Im smoking), but this is gross.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
4098,"2016-02-29",3.9,"Draft at Toronado-San Francisco, served in a stemmed glass. Pours a cloudy yellow gold with a small white head that settles into a bubbly ring. The nose is a bit muddled and jammed up, but things open up in the flavor. Woody, with lemon, lime, barely ripening stone fruit, bready malts, dust, and grapes. Light-medium bodied initially, with low carbonation and a tart, damp, increasingly heavy mouthfeel. Interesting beer that changes over time.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
4098,"2016-02-13",3.7,"[1/31/16] Draught sample at RateBeer Best festival in Santa Rosa. Cloudy yellow. Aroma is funky, very oaky, lemony, some sulphur and rubber. Dry flavor, tart, oaky, lemony, with some funk. Medium-bodied. Aroma is so-so, but tastes great. Very good and refreshing.","Tel Aviv, ISRAEL","DSG"
4098,"2016-02-07",2.8,"Draft - Sulfur and rubber notes. Clearish gold no head. Flat, odd fruit funk and more rubber. Not a fan.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
4098,"2016-02-05",3.7,"Keg at Toronado, SF, 02/02/16 (and also @ RB Best IIRC).
Golden with a decent off white cap that eventually whispers away.
Nose is pissy wood, lemon drizzle, funk, musty notes.
Taste comprises tarte white grape, yeast esters, light spice, balsa wood, lemon drizzle, apple core, musty.
Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close with a sharp citric finale of musty wood bite.
Solid for style.","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"

4098,"2016-02-02",3.8,"Draft at Toronado. Nose is moderate lemon with funkiness. Light woody notes. Fairly clear, pale yellow. Taste is lactic sour initially. Initially tart but fades quickly to a drying tannic finish. Decent.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
4098,"2016-02-01",4.0,"Sample at the RateBeer Best festival 2015. Pours quite hazy golden yellow, pretty much no head, no lacing. Guessing this is totally uncarbonated, as would be correct for style. Aroma is loaded with citrus, lemon, tangerine, as well as some horseblanket and basement funky notes, plus oak tannins. Flavor follows, a hint of sweetness initially drying out to a light plus tart and light plus funky citric oaky basementy brew. Really citrusy. Medium body, no carbonation. Glad to have tried it and to knock off another unblended lambic!","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
4098,"2016-01-31",4.2,"Draught at RateBeer Best festival. Hazy orange liquid with minimal white head. Aroma of lemon, apple skin, light giant, wood and mineral.

4098,"2016-01-31",3.9,"Tap at RBBEST2016. Pours hazy gold with no head. Mild tart/sour aroma. Med body or so. Flavo is mild tart sour, with a golden plum fresh taste. Very nice.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

4098,"2016-01-31",3.5,"On tap at Ratebeer festival. 
Aroma is libraries and wet oak. Some light citrus and pineapple. Light barnyard funk. 
Pours a hazy, straw gold with no head. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor is moderately acidic with some lemon and pineapple notes. Moderate oak notes with a light barnyard funk. A bit of a briny note but without the salt. Low bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with almost no carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, an alright beer but its definitely young. So much oak notes with lots of pineapple.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
4098,"2016-01-31",4.7,"Taster at Ratebeer best festival. Pours a golden color without any head. No carbonation. Tons of funk balancing nicely against a little tartness. Delicious.","California, USA","Bule"
4098,"2016-01-27",4.1,"On draft at the 2016 SF beer week opening gala. This is an uncarbonated single barrel sample of what wouldve become part of the blend to make up Beatification. It pours a clear pale golden yellow color with no head. The aroma is very full with citric grapefruit and lemon. Light oak and minerals. Not a lot of funk. The flavor is a tad more cheesy with lots of strong citric and lactic acid. Grapefruit and lemon. Very clean and puckering. No vinegar or solvent notes. Very light hints of oak, but this one is really all about the puckering acid profile. Mouthwatering. Seems like this is better flat. Its kind of like a vintage Beatification that has aged very gracefully. Really nice stuff.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
