Medium aroma of malts, caramel, Weizen yeast, banana, honey, juniper, grain, smoke and spices.

Appearance:

Turbid amber/orange beer with a slight off-white head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, Weizen yeast, banana, honey and juniper; ends slightly bitter and dry with smoke and spices.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. The first thing I noticed in this beer is the Weizen yeast, but it is so much more complex than that. That juniper berries are so noticeable and tasty in this beer. That slight smoke at the end wraps it up perfectly. The palate is thicker than would be expected with every sip.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"
