4021,"2017-01-26",3.2,"Draft... Pours murky and golden with a mid-sized, frothy, white head. Thick lacing. Fantastic retention. No nose - whats up with that? Maybe some sweet, crackery, pale malts, but thats about it. Light-bodied with airy carbonation. The flavor offers fantastic balance. Plenty of hop flavor and just enough bitterness to tame the crackery sweetness. There are some citrus rind-like notes her as well. Crisp, lightly bitter finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

The aroma is pretty good. There is a nice hoppiness up front. There is a light juiciness and a little zip with it. I like it. The flavor is good as well. Nice and juicy with a hint of funk and a beautiful bitter and floral lingering out the back end. Damn this is good. The mouth feel is incredible.

4021,"2015-08-12",4.8,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2016 750mL growler filled 7/24/15 and drunk 8/3/15.Was worried that, despite having kept this in a very cold fridge for 9 days, since it wasnt counter-pressure filled, it might not be in prime condition. Wrong. The appearance and mouthfeel/texture were still the same exquisite experience you know and love from Hill Farmstead. Huge, rocky white head tops a lightly hazy blonde beer with ample, fine carbonation. Tight carbonation engages the mouth and proves crisp while at the same time making for a supple, nearly creamy texture.And the aroma. Dear God. If this isnt the epitome of what nelson sauvin should be, I dont know what is. Meyer lemon, dry pineapple, juicy nectarine and even somewhat reminiscent of a rich, mineral laden chardonnay champagne. Beyond clean and flawlessly executed. Lets see, theres no: Resin, aspirin, pine, heavy acidity, dirt, dishwater, astringency, blandness, cat piss, cheese, onion. Just a beautifully made APA with a gentle honey-like maltiness backing the hops. Snappy, bright and infinitely aromatic with no alcohol whatsoever.Unsurprisingly, the flavor is just wonderfully hoppy, clean and perfectly balanced. Bright, clean, apricot-lemon flavors abound, with light tangerine, bits of dry hay and tart nectarine notes on the finish. Malt is soft, supple and provides just enough sweetness/texture to balance the hop bitterness without adding anything more. Honey, light grains and more fruity hop notes with warming. Unbelievably drinkable. Could nearly chug a liter of this without feeling fatigued/full.This is about as good as it gets and we are definitely in the ""If Im not giving this a 5.0, what are my reasons??"" territory. Because this is just so elegantly presented and clean and a statement of balance. I suppose the aroma could be a bit more full and juicy, though its easily a 9.5 here. And I guess, objectively, as has been shown, hops build off each other, so I could imagine adding another hop for just a bit more complexity. But these are nitpicks; this is pretty close to perfection. Much like Treehouse Tornado, my previously highest rated APA, I could easily understand a perfect 5.0 score without batting an eyelash. As is, Im not giving it a 5.0 but certainly will reserve the right to do so as soon as I can get more of this to try again.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Appearance : Clear pale yellow with small head. Nice color. Nice lacing.

Aroma : Awesome aromatics. Great floral and herbal hops with light white wine notes.

Taste : Great floral and fruity hops. Light white wine notes. Great floral finish with some malts. Light tangerines notes.

Overall : Wow. This is most likely the best Nelson Sauvin beer Ive ever had. The hop was so expressive and characteristic. An amazing display of the complexity of this hop carried by a greatly executed APA vehicle. Outstanding bouquet. Probably the first time I can easily get those fruity white wine notes from this hops. This beer blew my mind.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

Similar appearance to Walden and Edward, lemony yellow, very hazy, frothy thickly lacing head. Similar overall profile too, with austere crackery malts quietly allowing the hop canvas to showcase the lovely Nelson Sauvin hop. The hops are the star here, but Im impressed with the skill used in balancing this beer with a perfect malt bill that brings everything together. Its almost like the malts are not even here, but they are. HF has set a new standard for APAs for me.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

4021,"2013-08-01",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 2, 2013 What is a brewer? An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart but whose fingers are so formed that as stirs and bottles pass over them they, make beautiful libations. People crowd around and say to him, ""brew, brew again soon!""- in other words, may new sufferings torture your soul. And the beer losers say, ""That is right, according to our sense of entitlement."" Now of course a beer loser is just like a brewer, except that he does not have anguish in his heart, or magic in his fingers. Therefore, I would rather be a swineherd out in Greensboro, Vermont and be understood by beer losers than be a brewer and be misunderstood by people.

Oh! How unreasonable people are! They never use the freedoms they have but demand those they do not have; they have freedom of beer and they demand freedom of yet more beer.

I do not feel like brewing anything. I do not feel like bottling, the motion is too powerful. I do not feel like filling growlers, it is too tiring. In summary: I do not feel like doing anything.

As is known, whaledongs die in the moment of opening the precious bottle. So it is with all joy: the beer losers lifes highest, most splendid moment of enjoyment is accompanied by the death of a rare bottle.

Besides my other numerous circles of tasting groups and trading partners I have one more intimate confidant - my beer cellar. My beer cellar is the most faithful mistress I have known; what wonder, then, that I love her in return. Perhaps I love her too much.

Old age realizes the dreams of youth; look at Shaun E Hill: in his youth he built a brewery, in his old age he himself entered it.

I say of my sorrow what the Brewer says of his brewer: my sorrow is my latest hyped beer release and the beer nerds that accompany it. 

I feel as a CheesedMan must feel when the monger says of it: That wheel of gouda cannot be moved.

Alas, the door to a fortune does not open inwards so that one can force it by charging at it; it opens outwards and so there is nothing one can do but let the hoards buy my fancied beer.

Of all ridiculous things the most ridiculous seems to me, to be a beer rater. Therefore, whenever I see a fat bearded man with a notebook, slouched in the corner with six glasses in front of him, scribbling furiously, as sweat beads down his pudgy face, then I laugh heartily.

No beer comes back from the dead, no beer has entered the world without some crying; no beer is asked how it wishes to be served, nor when it wishes to be poured. 

This one was rushed across the country only to be opened in a dim bar. Its radiant golden hue overlooked by the ridiculous raters. Fleeting aromatic pleasures of melon, pineapple, and citrus. But for a moment: pine, cat urine, and biscuit malt. 

Alas, the flavor brings a temporary reprieve from the anguish of life in its pineapple, melon, grapefruit, and pine characters.

Most people pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

4021,"2010-12-09",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2013 In short: A vibrant IPA bursting with ruby red grapefruits and other tropical fruits
How: Tap at the brewery
The look: Cloudy orange-blonde body topped by a medium off-white head leaving good lacings
In long: Nose of ruby red grapefruits and a mix bag of tropical fruits.  Taste has crisp toasted cereals.  A light sugary note but overall low sweetness sensation.  Uber-fruity hopping with again tropical fruits with dominant ruby red grapefruits.  The bitterness of medium intensity is bit resinous.  Straightforward example of the style but flawless in the execution.  I had it very fresh when it first came out (I would have been the first rating) and it tasted like ruby red grapefruits wall to wall, nothing more, nothing less.  I had it a few months later and it has become a more normal IPA.  Im glad the girlfriend was driving when we visited this brewery because I was in no shape to drive afterwards.  She complains that my drinking is bothering her.  Bothering her?  My drinking is *killing* me and you dont hear me complain.  A true pleasure to drink.

4021,"2010-10-11",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2013 My Bottom Line:
Gorgeous tropical fruit and white grapes tantalize this Pale Ales lean honeyed sweetness, building a refreshing example of the style.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A thick head of foam covers the misty amber.
-This is a wonderful expression of the Nelson Sauvin hop, which I tend to prefer to Mikkellers own, for example. This one is akin to Beneluxs use of it in Sabotage.
-The piney bitterness tends to be overtaken by the loud fruitiness which precedes it. This doesnt taste that bitter at all.
-As all Hill Farmstead brews Ive had so far, this is easily drinkable, as it should be.
