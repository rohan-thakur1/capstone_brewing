147,"2015-04-22",4.0,"2 oz sample from bottle (375 ml). 2013 vintage.

Appearance: Clear pale bright golden. 

Aroma: Green apples forward, the Smoothee an the Golden Russen varieties are really the one shining here and gives this Ice Cider some white wine notes along pineapples and a touch of apricots. Honeyed notes. 

Taste: Moderate sweetness well balanced by a sharp acidity. Green apples forward as well, more caramel than brown sugar (its often the other way around in Ice Cider), pineapples, white wine and a touch of apricots. 

Palate: Medium body. White wine and pineapple finish. A bit dry. 

Overall: Probably the one with the most bright green apples of the Ice Ciders I have tried so far. Maybe a bit young. Nice tropical fruits features. Really tasty.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

147,"2011-03-11",4.8,"Appearance: clear brilliant rose hues  rose petals and Hello Kitty pink. Bubbles from pouring but otherwise carbonation-less.

Nose: fresh pressed apple pulp. Tickle of heat and spice in the back; spices, mulled cider. Faint strawberry and raspberry  subtle. Rose hips and rose water.

Palate: woah. Clean and intense. Flavors linger long atop the tongue. Sweet concentrated freshly pulped apples are spiced  skins are included for some tart tannic nibbles. Dry finish with apple skins. Predominantly red delicious and granny smith apples for tart nibbles to tame the sweetness. Coats mouth. Amazing. Raspberry and strawberry are subtle touches along the edges to compliment the tart and tangy. Inner skins of apples along sides of cheeks and inner lips.

Final Thoughts: without a doubt this was the most amazing beer of the RUDOLPH tasting at Erics house. Phenomenal. I could and would love to drink this cider every single day. It would never get old.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

147,"2010-06-03",3.8,"375 ml bottle shared with Rciesla.  Purchased at Peluso.  Pours a still clear bright peachy orange with some legs.  Aroma is somewhat fresh apple juice, not as fresh or sharp as some others, but still nice- honey sweetness, a touch of wax and green apple skin.  Flavor is syrupy sweet though not as big or thick as some 10% or above ciders, honey, floral, slight grass and vegetable with green apple skin slight astringency.  Mouthfeel is oily a touch waxy, smooth, and a good raw acidity that cuts the sweetness down a bit- sharp prickly acid on the tip and around the tongue gets a touch tingly which is nice.  Very smooth overall, mostly fresh I like the overall acid level and just seems very straightforward as a good ice cider- nothing too complex but still very enjoyable.  Earlier Rating: 1/24/2010 Total Score: 3.5375 ml bottle.  Pours a deep golden honey - fairly viscous and nice legs.  Aroma is applesauce, somewhat floral honey- some dull clove honey, light apple pie as well.  Flavor is a bit more dull than other ice ciders and there isnt nearly enough acidity to cut through the big 1 dimensional sweetness- some honeycrisp apples and jazz apple intense sweetness, just without a crisp acidity- just a bit on the dull side.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
147,"2010-02-02",3.2,"Broadly distributed ice cider which finds its way even in some grocery stores here in Quebec. It might as well for its an authentic, albeit straightforward example. While holding a fair share of acidity, it remains less so than most of the top examples, playing on a baked, brown sugar basis. Applesauce meets a fair share of fruit acids in this fresh, fragrant offering that feels a bit cloying for the flavour range it displays. Light-medium bodied for an ice cider, it remains accessible, yet more tha honest.Earlier Rating: 7/28/2005 Total Score: 3.74 types of apples used in this one. Still, golden, calm and leggy. Rather subdued juicy nose, fleshy apples, almost caramelly baked bread aspects. Very sweet concentrated apples taste, syrupy, nicely complex, a hint of skin like dryness.

147,"2006-09-07",3.6,"From the bottle at the cidrerie, 8/26/06.Lighter, perhaps, than most ice ciders Ive seen, or more precisely, with less a viscous look to it.  Its not exactly pale in color, having a strong caramel-tallow appearance.  The usual legs are created on the glass, but the overall dullness of the caramel-yellow is a little less appealing than some.  I really hate having to give appearance scores to ciders.....Syrupy sweet, mushy red and yellow apples in the nose are fresh, authentic and accompanied by a spicy, clove/cinnamon note.  Not overly alcoholic at all, in the nose, certainly not disruptive if present.  Bits of candied-apple and peach-like notes and an emerging hint of....toffee??  Aside from the spiciness, it finishes a little blunt, though clean and rich.On the tongue, it has a moderate coating effect, not being one of the heavier ice ciders Ive tried, though certainly sticky and flavorful, sporting light caramel, allspice and then a touch of waxiness on the end.  Maybe some green raisins and honey as well.  However, on the second sip, towards the finish, there is a slight cheesy note, almost sulpheric, or even buttery.  Buttertoffee meets buttered popcorn, perhaps.  Very faint, though, whatever it is, and not much to complain about.  It strikes a wonderful balance between the richness of the upper tier ice ciders and the more approachability of a lighter sweet cider.  Certainly nothing to skoff at.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
