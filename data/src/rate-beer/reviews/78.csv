78,"2016-02-14",3.2,"[2/3/16] Draught at The Good Hop in Oakland. Clear golden. Strong sage aroma. Flavor has sweetish malt, a bit of fruitiness, a tart note, and lots of sage. Medium-bodied.","Tel Aviv, ISRAEL","DSG"
78,"2016-01-29",5.0,"After the rain in the high desert...thats what this beer smells like. A refined but rich take on white sage that compares favorably to Crooked Staves Colorado Sage Wild Saison, which also uses white sage (and lemongrass).","Mountain View, California, USA","dpitinga"
78,"2014-12-04",5.0,"One of my favorite beers hands down. Suprisingly spiked with a delicious sage flavor which takes it over the top. The tripel wheat flavor is solid and a perfect baseline to allow the amazing sage flavor to shine through. Will always be one of my holy grails and i wish they bottled it *hint hint*","","itsamber"
78,"2014-10-05",4.0,"On tap at Hogs Apothecary. It pours a nice golden color with a tall white head. The aroma is very fragrant with sage, rosemary, spruce and a little background dried fruit. The flavor is full with ripe fruits and a perfect blend of spices and yeast derived phenolics. Aromatic with some nice sage in the aftertaste. Balanced and super tasty. Awesome.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
78,"2014-01-02",4.0,"This is one of my favorite, if not my favorite, triples in the world. The sage works in wonderfully with the classical triple aromas: banana, shortbread, vanilla,lots of belgian yeast. Pours a majestic clear hazy yellow, with prominent head, taste is very sweet and aromatic. Just delightful stuff by Craftsman which is, again, THE most underrated brewery I know of! Amazing!","Loa Angeles, Alabama, USA","dansac"
78,"2013-08-31",3.8,"Tap at Neighborhood. Full haze light golden. Thick white foam. Excellent lacing. Nose is bright sage, white pepper. Taste is thicker than, spicy white pepper, sage, mint, chamomile. Similar to Cellar Door order Cuvee des Fleurs. Abv is higher for being normal saison buy comes across similar to Dupont Avec les bon Voeux. Nice albeit stickier and heavier.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
78,"2012-09-01",4.0,"On tap.  Pours a golden orange with a small white head with some lacing. Aroma is of sage, Belgian yeast, candied sugar, some banana, and some caramel malt. Taste is similar with unique earthy spicy sage notes, Belgian yeast, banana, candi sugar, some cloves, and some caramel malts. Has a medium body with a semi creamy mouthfeel and a dry, spicy, sweet finish. Overall, a pretty tasty and interesting herb beer that was much better then I thought it would be.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","skmikeg"
78,"2011-11-11",3.7,"On tap at Monks Kettle for a Craftsman dinner.  Sensory overload on all aspects of this great beer.  The sage is so unique and pronounced.  You can even tell the base beer is top notch.","Redwood City, California, USA","Zymurgeist2"
78,"2011-10-07",3.5,"Draft. Rich amber beer with a dark cream colored head. Yeast and sage aroma with malt. Fruity, yeasty flavor with earth, spice,and sage. Medium bodied. Fruitiness and yeastiness lingers with spice and sage.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"

78,"2010-10-30",4.1,"Patrick and Mark...you ROCK!!!  The nose on this beer truly blew my mind!  Patrick said the sage was freshly picked from a trail by the brewery...incredible!  The fragrant sage, candied sugar, and Belgian yeast all played beautifully together...but the herb definitely took center stage!  The cloudy, lemon yellow body produced a small densely packed head.  The flavor also lets the sage shine through, but it wasnt quite as prominent.  A little bubblegum, a little citrus, honey-baked biscuit, vanilla, and spicy yeast all come to the plate.  Very tasty and really complex.  Another winner!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
78,"2010-09-24",3.3,"Appearance: Pours a semi-clear amber gold with a small white film of head.

Aroma: Big time sage and spicy Belgian yeast.

Mouthfeel: Syrupy with modest carbonation.

Overall:  Close to my favorite sage/herb beer Saison du Buff, but I like the drier yeast profile in SDB much better. This beer was close to toothpaste for me due to the Belgian sugar sweetness.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

78,"2010-09-10",3.6,"A: The pour is a light golden color with a fair amount of haze and a large, fluffy, white head.

S: There is definitely some sage in this beer. The sage actually dominates the aroma to the point where very little else comes through. Maybe a bit of sweet malts.

T: I was surprised by how well balanced the sage is in the flavor. Certainly, there is a lot of it, but it is nicely balanced by an intense malt sweetness and even some hints of vanilla and coconut (strangely enough). There is just a hint of bitterness on the finish.

M: The body is medium with a clean, smooth carbonation. Almost creamy, in fact.

D: I was not expecting to enjoy this one much, and my fears were reinforced after smelling the beer. But I suppose thats why we drink it.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
78,"2010-08-30",3.3,"A noble experiment, yet not one that will sustain. The sage is omnipresent, yet not overly spicy or herbaceous (remarkably). The tripel yeast does a nice job to mesh things together with its fruitiness, orange and spice. The alcohol is also necessary to this effect, yet creates issues of its own in terms if balance and mouthfeel. An interesting, enjoyable beer, but mainly as a novelty.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

Aroma of rosemary and banana-y Belgian yeast up frontwith some white pepper and alcohol--overall kinda sweet but cant pick what to attribute it to.  Flavor adds some stronger herbal notes to the aroma with a slightly lemony earthy finish, which was semi-dry with alcohol noticeable, and bitterness @ a 3.  Medium-full body with light to moderate carbonation.

78,"2008-08-09",3.2,"Draft at Lucky Baldwin. An unclear golden beer with a white head. The aroma is sweet with notes of malt, alcohol, and sage.

78,"2008-08-06",3.4,"Tap at Father’s Office Culver City.  I will probably never have this beer again, but it is an excellent spice beer.  Turns out I’m not a big fan of sage, and this beer is the High Mayor of Sagetown.  From the aroma to the three acts of the flavor, you get what you pay for: wave after wave of young sage leaves.  Your mind imagines white tea, white pepper, maybe even some cumin, bay leaves or rosemary; these are figments to break up the pulsing sage spice that has confiscated your consciousness for the duration of the pint.  This is a world-class style offering.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"
78,"2008-08-06",1.4,"From tap at Lucky Baldwin, Pasadena. Pours hazy orange with a lacing white head. Solid ginger and cinnamon spiced aroma.

78,"2008-07-31",3.8,"Sample at OBriens in San Diego. This brew is a hazy amber-gold color with a medium thin and creamy white head that recedes slowly. Stringy lacing. Aroma of fresh sage and ginger, along with touches of malt. Light-bodied with a sweet spiced character. Flavors of ginger and sage up front, with some sweet malt and tart apple following closely. The finish is spicy and fruity with a lingering sweet spicy aftertaste. Unique and tasty.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
78,"2008-07-30",3.8,"On tap at O’Briens with Katie. I really enjoy these unique spice beers. The use of sage creates a minty and fresh aroma with tones of ginger, mango and clove. Hazy yellow color with a medium off-white head. Retains a hefty tripel malt base with yeast and fresh bread flavors beneath the crisp spice. Intriguing and easy to drink. Yummy.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"
78,"2008-07-30",3.8,"Pours cloudy gold with a frothy white head.  Perfume aroma of bubblegum, yeast, and sage.  The taste is massive; it feels like it fills up my sinuses.  Loads of yeast esters, bubblegum, clove, and spice.  I could not really detect the sage (unlike in a beer like the Mammoth 395 IPA), as the other flavors overwhelmed my senses.  This is a very, very good beer, but in small quantities.  I found myself almost relieved when the glass was empty.","San Diego, California, USA","trokini"
78,"2008-07-20",3.9,"On Tap @ Toronado SD.   I was very surprised by this one.  Very Unique and very drinkable.  The sage, while there, takes a bit of a backseat.  The underlying beer is very tasty and balanced.  Nice job with this one.","Poway, California, USA","Naven"
78,"2008-07-10",3.0,"On tap at Beachwood BBQ.  I was nervous about this one tasting too much like a breakfast sausage.  It did a good job of not tasting like it.  In fact at the beginning it was absolutely delicious.  A tad spiced was all.  However as it went on, the sage became more obvious in burps and it actually became rather unpleasant.  I would recommend half of a glass, then quit there.","Long Beach, California, USA","UselessGdTaste"

The aroma screams Thanksgiving day turkey dressing in the nose, a unique and pleasant treat.  Some onion and yeasty bread as well.  Almost an underlying saltiness.  Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but the spices and herbs make up a bit where the texture lacks.  Tons of fresh herbs and a light green pepper spice are enjoyable on the tongue.  Final smack of sourdough bread seasoned with dried coriander and oregano.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
78,"2005-07-14",3.8,"(Draft: Lucky Baldwins in Pasadena, CA) Moderately sweet wheat base, spicy, coriander, I guess Im tasting sage?  Slightly bitter finish, moderate presence of alcohol is obvious, but not hot.  Im getting a moderate sensation of white wine.  I dont know the difference between many of the various cooking spices, so I dont know what sage smells like, but the sweet spicy nose smells like my live rosemary bush to me.  Medium bodiy, but sweet and lightly syrupy on the palate.  Medium golden color is somewhat cloudy in appearance.  Beautiful, full, white head leaves a dense blanket of lace on this Petrus tulip glass and looks gorgeous.  But the head settles to a partial film, and so the failure to retain even a complete covering atop the beer means it cant get a perfect score there.  Best Craftsman beer Ive had yet, and as seems typical, a well crafted beer.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
78,"2004-12-11",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 9, 2006 Draught at Lucky Baldwins, Pasadena 
What a fantastic brew! I consider Craftsman to be my ""local"" brewery, even though it is over 40 miles away it is the nearest producer of fine hand made, hand crafted, quality ales that I have available to me and this beer is by far their best offering.
Pours a hazy, golden-apricot colour with a thick, two-finger off-white head. Mild spicy hop aroma, almost smells of stale or aged hops. The aroma of candi sugar pokes through as well, with a pleasant earthy/spicy smell. To say this beer has quite a flavor is an understatement. An absurdly sage flavored belgian triple might be closer to the truth.  The taste is lightly malty sweet, quite herbal, and yet still light, refreshing and tasty. The earthy-herbal sage is definitely evident, from the aroma through to the finish.","Lancaster, California, USA","Sven"

Clear golden, lively, rich head. Rich gingery aroma. Sweet and fruity and rounded, fairly soft mouthfeel. Rich and mouthfilling with herbal notes and drier salty finish.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
78,"2004-09-28",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2007 Sampled on tap at Fathers Office
This beer has a hazy, honey color and a very thin, pale white, wispy head that never quite covers the top of the beer.  A nicely herbaceous note of sage hits my nose; it is very aromatic, green, a touch savory and something even like fresh weed.  Scents of orange zest, honey and clove are noticeable at times underneath the dominant sage aromatics.

The flavor has a certain sweetness to it, yet somehow the herbal character allows the over all perception of this beer to be dry.  The beer tastes of sage, of course, but interestingly enough it is note nearly as pronounced as it is in the nose.  Notes of honey, biscuit-like malt, a hint of bergamot and even some peach-like pear flavors are found here.  The sage & yeast character evokes notes of mint, perhaps a touch of rosemary, pitch and perhaps even some coriander notes.  The carbonation, though somewhat light, adds some sharpness via carbonic acid, as does some peppery / ginger fermentation derived flavors.

This has a fairly full mouthfeel to it; the malt almost sticks to the palate.  It is certainly not rich, though it is in line with many examples of Tripels.  I wonder if the honey notes, which are certainly malt influenced, are accentuated in my mind by the sage; after all sage-honey is a tasty nectar.  This pairs really well with food, which plays up the honey and malt flavors and allows the sage to pair and meld with the food flavors.
Sampled September 2004
Pours a nice hazy gold color with a thick off-white head.  This beer has quite the aroma to it, I get an earthy-herbal-astringent note, that is jointed by notes of clove, and something that reminds me of fried potatoes (but only in the best way).  The taste is lightly sweet, quiet herbal, yet still light, refreshing and tasty.  The earthy-herbal sage is definitely evident, from the aroma through to the finish.  A year or so of bottle conditioning could make this beer phenomenal.  It is still a bit sweet, and though it is enjoyable in it fresh rawness the sage could meld quite a bit more into this currently tasty beer, and make it that much more tasty.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
