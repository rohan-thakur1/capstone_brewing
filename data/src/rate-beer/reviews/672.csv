672,"2017-04-25",3.4,"A 330ml bottle with a best before date of 28th December 2018. Poured into a snifter. It was a cloudy brown colour with quite a bit of small to tiny sediment, a thin tanned head that dissipated quickly and some sparse spotty lacing. Aromas were sweet, malty, caramel, dark dried fruit, wood with some light smoke and alcohol. Tastes of roasted malts, caramel, wood, vanilla and smoke. There is some whisky character, and light sweet dark dried fruit, mostly prunes and raisins. Full bodied with light carbonation. Overall, I find that not many beers taste better than its aroma, but this beer falls in that category. The sweetness coming from the aroma kind of put me off a bit. But this was not the case when I tasted it as the barrel character was clearly the main attraction (smoke, vanilla, wood) and it was a good thing (for me), that the sweetness of the dried fruit was only in the background.","Hong Kong, HONG KONG","davidezdonz"

Clear, red brown coloured beer with an off-white thin head. The taste is big, definately has the sherry going on which blends really nice with the subtle smokiness. Molasses, sweetness and caramel malts add to the body, which is still just a little too thin. But thats the only minor. More enjoyable with each sip.","Baarn, NETHERLANDS","skortila"
672,"2013-11-23",4.3,"Bottle from Cornelius. Pours deep brown with a touch of ruby. Small light brown head that fades fairly quickly. Molasses, smoke, sherry on the nose. Great body, sticky and a little thick. Coffee, sherry, a little treacle. Sweet finish. Delicious!

672,"2013-11-10",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2014 Bottle courtesy of Dan - merci beaucoup! Pours a deep, deep brown with lighter ruby tinges. Aroma is dark berries, chocolate, some coffee chocolates, and some milk (maybe the bourbon barrel coming through). Taste is stunningly rich - dark fruits, coffee, bourbon, sherry, a little bit of milky creaminess. Full bodied (its like drinking a meal) and a finish that lasts ages, with a great sweet linger. This is the best beer Ive had for a VERY long time.","SCOTLAND","FaithHealer1"
672,"2013-11-10",4.3,"Bottle at home. Dark brown, thick beige head. Big smoke, soy ham, toffee, soft chocolate nose. Very complex and woody. Sweet front, huge toffee, some sherry fruits, lightest vanilla oak, warm soft booze, slightly hot prickly toasty smoky finish. Very subtle barrel characteristics, really skilful blending. Great rich sweetness, a true dessert beer. Definitely benefitted from a few months of age. Stunning.","SCOTLAND","dantheman278"

672,"2013-10-29",3.9,"Bottle - thanks BenH! Pours cloudy reddish mahogany, large creamy tan head that sloooowly dissipates with nice lacing. Aroma is quite malty, burned toffee, smoke, oaky. Flavor is similar, definitely smoky and malty. A touch of spiciness - almost holiday spices in the background. Not getting much bourbon per se, but there is a strong oaky barrel presence in both taste and the tannic astringence. Light to medium sweet, not a lot of bitterness, but the acidity is pronounced. Medium body, creamy mouthfeel. Some heat - drinks about like the 10% it is, maybe a bit hotter. All in all a nice beverage, just not world class.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
672,"2013-10-18",3.7,"Bottle picked up in Glasgow if memory serves. It pours darkest ruby-brown with a thick yellow-white. The nose is dark fruit, jam, sherry, wood, toast, mild smoke, cloves and mint chocolate. The taste is toast, smoke, scorched earth, dark fruit, raisin, wood, light jam, spice,meatiness, warming alcohol and vanilla with very dry finish. Full body, moderate carbonation and foamy mouth-feel. Smells amazing, but the taste is not quite there. A very well crafted beer nonetheless.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"

672,"2013-09-15",3.8,"Bottle from Beer Hive, Edinburgh [160913] 
Caramel brown, dark ruby light through, clear, off white head
Aroma - Raisin malts, little smoky, dark fruity malts, caramel, soft sherry, dab of molasses, some alcohol
Taste of rich fruity caramel malts, raisin, soft sherry, dark fruits, very soft smoke, barrel aging is subtle, quite boozy though
Palate - Medium carb, medium body, fairly syrupy sweet fruity palate, mouthcoating. Finish as main flavour, touch hot on the alcohol, bit of smoke on the tail
Overall - I like the subtle barrel aging here....perhaps a little too boozy","Near Carrick-on-Shannon, IRELAND","stravale"

672,"2013-04-15",4.3,"Couldnt look more like Coca-Cola if they tried in terms of body - dense brown with a light caramel tinge - and head - fizzy carbonation beige - if they tried. Streams of carbonation on the initial pour but head drifts away quietly.
Massive swathes of boozy smoke, stickly sweet oak. Initial taste on first pouring is sumptuously carbonated, but a little carry forward on the bourbon/sherry vibe. Dead centre vibe of melted caramel, crunchy enough but a threat of earthy/soily dusting taken away quickly by crystallise sweetness. The finish is equally so and continues the Coke vibe - like the dispense syrup from a Soda Stream, especially towards the end of the bottle/pour in syruppy sweetness and flat thickness clawing into the crevaces of your teeth and clinging on for dear life.
I love the development of this through the drinking and please I had it solo first. The initial half was very gulpable, even with the telling ABV. If someone handed me an ideal mix of Coke, JD, Sherry and a wee bit of dark malty/yeasty beer Id stupidly down pints of this. The carbonation and sweetnes meet in the middle in an explosion of malt. Clearly the yeast focus worked wonders. Id probably explode if I knew there was a cask of this knocking around.
