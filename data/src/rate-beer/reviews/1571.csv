La bouche a un peu trop dalcool chaud, des poires sy mêlent et du miel. Ce saké est chaleureux.","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","rodenbach99"

Many other sakes have a harsh taste, but this is very smooth. I would enjoy drinking this for a while. Yum. Now if only i had some suchi. You see, the problem is that this junk hurricane is keeping me indoors and I cant get sushi because the rain is keeping me inside. Dont worry though internet, I have ample amounts of alcohol to get me through these tough times.","Maryland, USA","hypn0toad"

1571,"2009-02-08",3.4,"Partagé avec French tickler et Agaguk. Acheté à la SAQ en format de 720ml et dit meilleur avant le 08-09-25. Apparence de couleur eau clair sans mousse et sans carbonation. Arômes similaire au vodka avec un ajoux de sel et de coconut avec une touche de mente. Goût de melon miel, de sel et de riz. Même si le liquide est clair comme de leau de roche il est quand même dense en bouche. Un bon saké mais il en a des meilleurs.","val-des-monts, Quebec, CANADA","grandgenie"

Flavor: mint, a mix of white wine and Vodka but mostly vodka.  Palate: light, thin, oily and no carbonation.

Arome de riz, amande, melon miel, amidons, gallette de sarazin... juste un peu trop bizarre pour moi.  Vodka, vodka, vodka, alcohol, vodka, eau sallée.  Texture dun vin blanc diluée.  Je naime pas dutout ce style donc la cote en reflete grandement.  Serais-ce trop froid?  Gout de vin blanc diluée, alcohol et riz blanc.  Beurk.","Aylmer, Quebec, CANADA","french tickler"
