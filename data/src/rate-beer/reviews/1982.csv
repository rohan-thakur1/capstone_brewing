1982,"2015-08-21",3.8,"Sharp sour nose with clear oak and red wine characteristics, with some roasted malt in the backbone. Low carbonation, more dark chcolate oak and red barrels in the mouth. Slightly acidic. Lingering red wine (zin?!?) in the finish. Very nice stuff, with red wine really Shining.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
1982,"2014-07-27",4.2,"Dark brown color with a medium sized, tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of roasted malts, vanilla, red wine, leather, char, and light alcohol. Taste of red wine up front, vanilla, roasted malts, some cocoa, charred barrels, and a dry finish. Creamy mouthfeel.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
1982,"2013-08-07",3.9,"750 ml bottle courtesy of BeerandBlues2 (thanks Brad!) poured a clear dark reddish brown with a lasting tan head. Aromas of roasted malt, earthiness, red wine and bitter chocolate. Palate was medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of roasted malt, dark chocolate, light red wine and light oak with a smooth lingering chocolate finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
1982,"2013-02-20",3.9,"750ml from The Perfect Pour, Elkridge, MD. Fairly pricey bottle but Im glad I plumped for it, since the suggestively multiple character of the base beer was really enhanced and deepened by the red here. Vigorous pour, near-black with reddish tints. Wine, oak, fruit, and dark chocolate in the nose, with a richly earthy grain component in there that accentuates the rustic characteristics. Much of the stout personality is deeply sublimated here, and the beer is transformed (for the better) into a dark, vinous farmhouse improvisation on the base style. Very nice.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
1982,"2012-11-25",3.8,"750 mL bottle shared by maniac at the Richmond Industry Gathering. Pours a clear dark brown color with a thin creamy brown head. Aroma of chocolate, roasted malts and wine. The taste is chocolate, wine, herbal notes and a faint bit of heat. Medium bodied. Nice.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
1982,"2012-11-19",4.0,"750ml bottle. Pours a deep, inky obsidian shade that is impenetrable by light. A short, taught head of light brown froth slowly fades to a wispy surface film, leaving patchy, tattered splotches of lacing on the glass. The nose shows copious amounts of dry, dark roast, suggesting of bitter cocoa, burnt barley, soft anise, and some black licorice. Yeast is fruity, estery, and distinctly Belgian. Oak imparts dry vanilla tones, peppery, tannic red wine,  and earthy wood. Flavors follow suit - rich and full but sufficiently dry. Roast for days. Burnt malt and scorched sugars dominate the base. Yeast is prominent and spicy, showing subtle hints of banana and clove. Wine and oak enhance the dryness of this brew. The palate sports an ample body, but it stays dry and crisp throughout. Moderate carbonation cuts right through the sugars. Its a slow sipper, for sure. Great with a steak. Damn fine beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1982,"2012-06-18",3.5,"pour is jet black, fairly tight light brown head. the nose is different, rather peaty, light roast, black licorice is strong with a touch of grape. The taste is heavy peat, light dry bakers chocolate, sweetness in back, red grapes and light vinous. The body is creamy, gentle carbonation and very drinkable.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
1982,"2012-06-14",3.8,"Bottle, 06/14/2012.  Pours black with small tan head which quickly dissipates, leaving a ring of suds around the glass, actively fed from below.  Aroma hits first with red wine and oak from the barrel, opens out into chocolate and roasted malts,  sweeter fruit jam notes.  Taste has lovely raspberry notes with chocolate, light cocoa roast bitterness, subtle tartness and wine in the finish.  Medium palate, smooth with a bit of bite from the tartness.  Nice, glad I could try this one.","New York, USA","jbeatty"
1982,"2012-06-06",3.9,"750ml bottle. Poured a dark brown color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of chocolate, vanilla, with some lighter red wine. Tastes of chocolate, wood, vanilla, roast, and vinous.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"

1982,"2012-05-14",3.5,"This poured a really dark red to brown color with a beiege head. Aroma was dark chocolate, roasted malts, some dark fruits and tiny hints of wine.  Flavor was much the same, not very much barrel character at all but a nice stout nonetheless.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
1982,"2012-05-11",3.4,"Foiled capped 750ml bottle and served in NB worthy glass: Pours a deep brown hue with noticeable ruby highlights around the edges and at the bottom of the glass. Not much in the terms of head nor lace. The aroma has notes of bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, walnuts, oak, red  grape, plum and french oak. Also has a very yeast drive nose, very similar to what you get with some Belgian styled stouts. The taste is malt forward with a lot of cocoa, roast and nuts with a nice twangy and slightly acidic fruit component. The finish is a tad ashy, tannic, and very earthy. Not much going on in between however. The mouth feel is slick and oily, seems the barrel aging has sapped some of the body from this brew.  Overall and interesting beer but not too sure I would ever pay that kind of money for it again.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1982,"2012-04-09",3.7,"750, capped and foiled. Pours ebony with a dense and creamy dark tan head that sticks around, but hovers around the 1/8"" mark for most of its time in the glass. Interesting look--also, you can clearly see ruby tones in the pour, before the stream broadens and settles in the glass. That red wine carries through even in low ambient light. But once its in the glass it just looks like any ol foreign stout, at least in terms of ruby luminescence. Nice dry baking chocolate nose balanced with a bit of berries and wood, but not sharpened at all. Creamy medium body with soft carb. Mild baking chocolate and a bit of roast on the mid palate, followed by a little berry and some wood. Pleasant, harmonious, beautifully integrated...but hardly seems worth all the trouble they went to to make it.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
1982,"2012-04-05",3.3,"Bottle at MAxs. Medium head and lacing, fell quickly.  Poured a thick dark brown color. Aromas of cocoa, oak, vino, roasted malt. Taste was cinnamon, cabernet, and cherry oak. Warming.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
1982,"2012-04-02",3.6,"Bottle shared by willblake, thanks Jon. Poured a deep dark brown body with a large frothy beige head. Aroma of chocolate cake and red wine, slight touch of mustiness, wet earth. Full body with a foamy fizzy fuller mouthfeel, a slight touch of sourness midway through and then a quick fade on the finish. Flavor of dirty chocolate, red wine and wet oak. Good stuff but maybe a touch more wine.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
1982,"2012-03-29",4.1,"Bottle at Maxs.  Pours black with a medium, frothy tan head, medium retention with good lacing.

1982,"2012-03-14",4.0,"Great combination... Belgian style stout in a red wine barrel.  As a stout its classic chocolate on the nose but in the wine barrel it adds a slightly sour cherry note and a bit more complexity in the flavors.  Pours with a nice mocha colored head and a deep burnt umber color.  A nice bubble presents flavors of chocolate, coffee, burnt cherry, licorice... the flavors compliment nicely and make for a very unique beer and the best of the series... the series being the bourbon barreled and the original folklore.

1982,"2012-03-10",4.1,"Tap at the Blind Tiger. The nose integrates the red wine well, a gentle balance of lightly carbonic acid, subtle roast malt, caraway and thyme. Good body, high carbonation appropriate for the style. Dry and herbal. Great stuff.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

1982,"2012-02-11",3.4,"750mL thx to Travlr at The Trappist. Pours near black with a medium coffee head. Good lace. Grape jelly nose. Slightly sugary and stinging. Taste is bitter raspberry dark chocolate, mild coffee , stinging raspberry tea. A bit tannic, sweet, but not bad. Sharper alcohol character. Fun to try. Maybe not worth $20+ a bottle.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1982,"2012-02-04",3.3,"Thanks to yourefragile for the assist. Pours a very dark brown with a thin head. The nose brings a light amount of oak plus a heavy dose of red wine. Flavor has a strong bit of wine and moderate roast in the background. Somewhat tannic. Light-medium body with good carbonation. Very slight wine-like acidity to the finish. Pretty good, but not as good as the bourbon version.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"

Very earthy yeast flavor, chocolate, considerable roast and light bitterness, bit of cherry, nice dry brownie finish, low sugar. Reminds of Fear and Trembling series with more roast, larger body, more acid, less wine, dryer. Just better actually. Great balance and blend, amazingly dry for 8.4%.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
