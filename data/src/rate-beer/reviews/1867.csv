1867,"2007-05-22",4.2,"Enjoyed a pint of this one on draught, at the Centreville, VA location. Pours to slightly hazy, deep golden color, with a thick, creamy, white head, and a good carbonation. The nose is excellent, with good pale and grainy malt aromas, paired with light hints of peppery alcohol. The palate is firm, with lots of good, crisp, pale and grainy malt flavor, on a smooth, clean, body. This beer finishes with more good, crisp, pale malt flavor up front, then ends with some good herbal hop bittereness, that balances and drys the beer out. Well done domestic example of maibock. At 7.7% abv it is a the kind of beer that could sneak up on you in hurry. Works well with a number of dishes on Sweetwaters menu, and a nice beer to sip and relax with a the bar.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
1867,"2007-05-03",3.9,"Draft at Merrifield location.  Fantastic brew, light, golden clear color, with a thick white head.  Malty aroma, with some fruits.  Flavor is pretty light, and the that of caramel and honey.  For being over 7.5 the alcohol is masked quite well.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
1867,"2006-05-14",3.4,"Draft... Sterling, VA location... Crystal clear, deep golden lager with a mid-sized, fluffy, white head. Great retention. Malty, fruity nose. Flavor-wise, good balance for the style... however, honey-sweet and only mildly bitter (its still a bock). Medium to full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Finishes a bit thin, but a joy overall.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

1867,"2005-04-06",3.8,"Clear amber orange with a medium off-white head. Fruity aroma with pilsneresque hops. Taste has notes of caramel, fruitiness, toasted malts and plenty of hops. Pretty sweet with a somewhat bitter hop finish. Alcohol presence evident but not overpowering. Medium body with a very smooth texture and subtle carbonation. Plenty of lacing, great head retention. Good stuff.","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"
1867,"2005-03-13",3.8,"Golden-amber body topped by a frothy white head with very nice glass lace. The aroma is light sweet malt grassy noble hopsm and light alcohol. The flavor is pretty nice sweet maltsw up front then a hefty dose of grassy and floral hops develop, all the while the alcohol stays back but is never totally absent. Medium bodied, very soft. Really quite nice IMO.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

1867,"2004-05-12",3.4,"Bright gold.  Nose vaguely sweet, definite honey tones, bit of toastiness to the malt.  Quite sweet, honey continues in the flavor, bit of fruitiness as well.  Decently balanced with toasty and bready malts, finishes crisp with a bit of hops.  Palate is a bit thick and syrupy, reminds me of some of the ""imperial pilsners"" Ive had recently (which arent pilsners, but this was kind of like that).","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
