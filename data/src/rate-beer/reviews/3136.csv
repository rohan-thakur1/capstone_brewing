3136,"2017-05-12",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
Juicy peaches momentarily turn to jam and candy before being awash in citrusy tartness and comfortable, natural bubbles.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the misty peach blond.
-Mouthfeel is lush and conducive to high drinkability.
-Peach flavors are nicely expressive while not wanting to dominate everything.
-Some sips feel like this is a more delicate Cantillon FouFoune.

3136,"2016-07-19",3.8,"From notes. Enjoyed at Dougs house for the Epic Peach and Apricot debacle of a tasting that happened on July 9. 750 mL bottle. I am stoked to try this one! The pour is a golden amber color with a little haziness and a small off white head that falls down pretty quickly. The aroma is interesting. There is a funky peach juice all over it at the start, and then it moves through ha tart skin, light dustiness and into a spicy saison grain type of finish. Its pretty complex, and I wasnt expecting it. The flavor is a little more strange. There is a funky peach juice going on, but it tastes almost a little syrupy. The sourness doesnt hardly pop at all. There is a tart skin on the finish. The mouth feel is a little thicker and carries a softer carbonation. The after is almost a lightly sweet tart juice and a lingeringly funky dustiness. Its really interesting. Not sure how I feel about it entirely.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3136,"2016-07-16",2.9,"Yields a clouded amber-yellow color with a decent sized head. 

Lots of ripe, almost overripe peaches on the nose with an earthy quality and ice-tea sweet malts. A faint, funky, dusty sourness cuts through the prominent fruitiness, which reveals a luscious sweetness, reminding me of a peach jogurt.

Has a medium carbonation among a fuller body with a late dryness, coating up the sourness. 

Drinks with a heavy, fermented fruitiness from the very beginning, complimented by sweet, cakey malts and a creamy softness. Has a jogurty sourness, which gets accompanied by a perfumy peach fruitiness throughout. Finish with more acidic jogurt, still soft on the tongue with even more perfumy peach.

Seems a bit unbalanced to me due to the overly artificial, perfume dominance, which is pretty intense on both aromas and flavors. Got a nice, well fitting tartness, which adds to the richness of the peaches. Unfortunately its pushing too far, adding a distractive artifical flavor to the taste.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Light yellow tint to its otherwise snow white color and a bright, clear, copper-canteloupe-golden body.Big peachy nose is almost all skin, lending leathery, spicy and even earthy notes to the otherwise well-malted (cookies and cream, dry caramel, vanilla) and moderately ""bretted"" nose. Some definite booze to it, though its not intense, with heavy lime and hickory nut skin on the finish mixing with the peach to add a unique complexity.Strong peach skin/pit in the flavor with white grape and heavily attenuated peach juice. Tons of acidity resulting with moderate brett tartness but also a bit of inelegant bread and heavy floral character from the brett. Lip smacking juiciness and a richly malted but fairly well attenuated texture with all of the full, fairly tight carbonation that comes with their beers. Maybe a bit too much carbonation and body, in the end with some booziness to boot. But the peaches are done better here, and uniquely so, than any other peach beer I can recall. So much leather, white grape, tart juice and wonderfully integrated with the malt.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Musty brett aroma with some barrel and a boat load of luscious organic peach. Farmhouse yeast and musty funk in the nose with dry brett, damp wood and a very prominent peach presence. Nice fruited saison. The brett really stands out after it warms and is nicely complimented by the oak. The peach character is dominant but doesnt smell artificial nor is it overpowering. Nice balance of different characteristics in the nose. 

Medium bodied with a prominent musty brett character along with dry oak and sour peach. The dry brett flavor is really strong with musty funk perfectly complimenting the farmhouse yeast. Oak is dry/toasted but blends nicely with the bugs and funky yeast notes. Peaches come in at the end with a luscious organic feel. Not cloying or overly sweet with some sour acidity lingering in the finish. Slightly puckering with pit and fleshy fruit flavor. Very complex but its one of most balanced beers Ive ever had.

I never paid attention to what it was until after enjoying this, and Im very surprised.  This beer is amazing. Incredible lingering, slightly sour orange fruit flavor. Loved everything about this beer.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

3136,"2015-07-16",4.3,"Bottle. Wow! Tropical fruity notes with soft peaches everywhere. Light brett funk notes on the finish. Basically perfect all around. Complex yet, simple and very enjoyable to drink.

3136,"2015-06-28",3.8,"So excited to try this one and have to be honest in that it disappointed. Bright 10 karat/tangelo pour with a tightly-packed ivory crown. Aroma was filled with fresh peaches and nectarines, along with lemongrass, and black pepper. Flavor is less bright and assertive, sharing similarities with the nose and adding some funky barnyard cheesiness. Alcohol was much higher than anticipated and not noticeable in the least.

FLAVOR has notable tart peaches, earthy / musty yeast, bretty tang, lemon, unripe tart pear, dry oak, some bready malts.

3136,"2014-03-15",4.4,"Rating #1600. 750 ml beeswax-dipped bottle. Aroma is packed with peachy, dusty bretty goodness. Pours hazy cantaloupe with a medium white soapy head that falls in a minute, leaving a collar of foam and some lace. Taste is sour (7/10 on a sour scale), peachy, bretty, very dry. Carbonation is high, but not the annoying champagne-like effervescence that some of these beers have. This is about just right. Nice beer. Now, if I could, the reason I chose this as a milestone rating. The trouble I went to get this bottle is pretty crazy, so it deserves a milestone rating. So--Ive been through Oregon a handful of times, but I dont know it all that well. Coming back from Russian River for Pliny the Younger a few weeks ago, my brother and I decided to hit as many breweries as we could on the way back to Idaho. Logsdon was one of those breweries. According to our brilliant smartphones, all we had to do was make a minor detour after leaving Bend to reach the brewery near Hood River. I remember it getting slightly snowy before it just started dumping on us in a matter of seconds. Perhaps I should have done a bit more research, but I wasnt aware that we were going to have to go through a snowbelt in my wifes minivan to get to our destination. All signs were covered up with snow, completely unreadable, and I just figured it would mellow out. It didnt! It got so we couldnt see 10 feet in front of us. We get these kinds of winters all the time in North Idaho, but I wasnt expecting it here, therefore the brilliant idea of bringing my wifes minivan instead of my truck to save on gas came to be. Blaming my hungover ass for not researching this trip better would definitely be fair. So we keep climbing in elevation and the snow just keeps escalating, and the snowfall is so thick that its not really safe to drive faster than 15 MPH, and there is snow packed up over 6 feet high on either side of the road were on. This goes on for what seems for miles and miles. I dont even know how high up Mt. Hood we were, or even if we were on Mt. Hood! Once again, you can blame this apathy and lack of research on our Pliny-induced hangovers, however pathetic that may sound. At last, we finally begin going back downhill again. We finally get out of the heavy snow where grass and landscape are actually visible and we find what we think might be the place, but theres only one car parked there, so we park next to it. We go up to the barn, not even sure if its the brewery or not, but it looks like the one on the beer labels, so, but...nobody home. After about 10 minutes of walking around this barn, I spot the brewer working. Feeling like a total tourist jackass, I knock on the window. The guy answers, telling me that theyre only open Thursday through Saturday (it was Wednesday). He was just about ready to lock up when we showed up. He needed to get to the post office before they closed, which was in about 15 minutes. I talked him into selling us each a bottle of Peche n Brett, you know, since we came all this way, which he was more than happy to do. After our transaction was complete, we got back in the minivan and tried to get out of there so he could get to the post office. Our intentions were pure, but minivans are not made for farmyard driveways. We got stuck in the mud, and after what seemed like ages, we were able to rock ourselves out of the ruts we were creating. During the entire ordeal, the brewmaster was waiting patiently by the gate so he could lock up, waiting for our dumbasses to get out so he could get to the post office. We ended up having to go *forward* instead of back up the driveway, which meant driving through his yard and over a minor embankment to get back on the road out of there. Going over the embankment, it was very possible that the van could have rolled over like an idiotic turtle. It was one of the most embarrassing things Ive ever been through, and thats why this beer deserves a milestone rating. After waiting in line for 7 hours the previous day for Pliny the Younger and then now this, I just thought, ""the things I go through to get good beer... fucking hell!"" The end result is always worth it, though, not just for the beer, but for the stories I can now tell.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"

Aroma does have fresh peaches (woo hoo), wheat, light grains, and some sweet golden that was not in the other beers. Mouthe feel is medium for rhe style and there is medium carbonation. Flavor again has authentic peach, golden sweetness, light brett, wheat, and a smooth finish that brings the fruit back around again. Incredible the difference the peach makes here making this a totally different beer. Sweetness counters the brett and is just so punchy here. I was afraid the fruit would die back and got to this quickly but I am super impressed how well it has stood up and can see it going quite a but further and still getting better.","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"

T: Peachy flesh, oaky wood. Yeasty spice and some nice tartness. There is a fruity and bretty funk to this. The finish has some musty cobwebs.

M: Medium to light bodied with a nice refreshing finish. There is more mustiness than sourness overall.

O: I would have liked a little a little more tartness and sourness for a wild ale, but it was really nice overall. The fruity sweetness from the peach was really a treat (I really like peaches). Definitely a must try.

3136,"2012-08-26",4.3,"Brought this to our Sunday mini whale tasting. Poured into a nondescript snifter. Peche NBrett pours a cloudy peach color (weird right?) with about a half fingers worth of white head. Pretty good head retention when I swirl my glass. The nose has two separate entities: the peach and the seizon bretta. There is quite a bit of fresh peach and then it falls back on the farmhouse base. I had this yesterday and I didnt get much peach in the flavor, but that was after having a semi-fresh Fou Foune which is pretty stiff competition. Today, I notice way more of the peach peeking through, its still subtle, but it is really a nice easy drinker. The beer has a nice light mouthfeel, good carbonation, gentle tartness, and a moderate finish. Upon a second go at this, I like it quite a bit. I was severely disappointed yesterday with it yesterday, but my opinion has take a 180 today. This is a really nice subtle beer that is a perfect summer beer. Its shocking that this thing is 10% because I can drink tons of this.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"
3136,"2012-08-26",4.0,"Bottle generously shared by Seth.  Cloudy yellow pour with a big foamy white head.  Sour peach aroma.  Ironically the fast is, wait for it, SOUR & BRETT!!!!  Slightly over-carbonated and effervescent.  If the carbonation was right this might be a real stunner.....","Florida, USA","50belair"
3136,"2012-08-26",4.0,"Bottle... This beer rocks! Cloudy, straw-colored ale with a mid-sized, creamy, white head. Fantastic retention. The acidic aroma furnishes loads of crushed peach and funky, bready, snappy brettanomyces. Medium-bodied and astringent with zippy carbonation. Unlike the nose, the flavor is only mildly tart. Sweet peaches balanced by yeasty, minerally bitterness. Finishes tangy, bready and Sahara-dry. This world class brew was shared by newcigarz!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3136,"2012-08-23",4.2,"Pours hazy gold, no head. Aroma rich in Brett and peaches. Taste follows, wow the peach and Brett play nice together. I really like this beer

3136,"2012-08-16",4.4,"Huge, huge thanks to boralyl for this one.  Served in a cervoise.  Pours a slightly-cloudy light peach color. Wow. Let's start that way.  Nose has huge peach plus earth and mild funk.  Dry and a bit creamy. Dry. Touch acidic. Some wheat. Incredible.

3136,"2012-08-08",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2012 Pours cloudy peach golden in color with a huge creamy white head. The aroma is perfect soft sweet peaches so pleasant in the nose that you cant get better than this. I could smell it all night like Fou Foune. The flavor brings sweet and tangy peaches on a medium creamy and carbonated body blended so well together. The Brett works really well here, and there is no booze at all for an ABV of 10, on a sour To BOOT!","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
3136,"2012-08-06",4.5,"Wow.  Wonderful beer shared by someone at Woodshop.  THANK YOU! pours an apricot color with a fluffy white head.  The aroma is wonderful...just loaded with tart peach and peach skins with the brett adding such a perfect note to the nose.  The flavor is tart, light and fluffy, brett is there...just a perfect blend of fruit, funk and yeast.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
3136,"2012-07-13",4.6,"Pours a hazy light orange color with a foamy white head that eventually dissipates to a snowy white ring around the edges. Nice thick lacing. Aroma is intense peaches, light oak, mild brett. Taste follows the same, lots of peaches, mild tartness, good clean hop profile balances out the huge malt bill (10% abv!). Slight warmth in the throat from the alcohol, but more or less undetectable. This is seriously dangerous and very delicious! Reminiscent of a barrel aged fruit beer from Upright. Some of the same characterists as Fantasia. Would be interesting to do a side by side with these two great OR beers.","Seattle, Washington, USA","julian"
3136,"2012-07-04",4.4,"750mL bottle. Reviewed from notes

A: Very cloudy yellow. Good lacing. Slides off the glass.

N: Intense peach. Dry earthiness. Some light lemon and citrus.

T: Sour, sugary peaches. More of the lemon. Some herbal bitterness and pine floor. The brettanomyces are making their presence known with some dry funk. Not much oak here, surprisingly, but I wouldnt call it a defect.

M: The saison mouthfeel dominates here, in a good way. Light and airy. No alcohol. Cant believe it.

O: Goodness in a bottle, and I wish this wasnt such a limited release. Definitely not a beer for people who hate this particular stone fruit, though. Im hesitant to age my other bottle because Im afraid the peaches will disappear.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
3136,"2012-06-28",4.4,"Bottle served in a tulip. Pours very hazy light orange with a short white head. Good retention. Intense fleshy peach laden aroma. Also shows noticible brett and light oak. Light sweet, tart peach flavor. Light-medium body, average carbonation, oily texture, medium acidity and a fruity, tart, dry finish. Surpringly cleaner than Seizoen Bretta for me with the peaches and brett leveling out the farmhouse funk. This is terrific!","Portland, Oregon, USA","cmonster"
3136,"2012-06-19",4.4,"Peach is instantly noticeable on the nose. Black pepper spice notes and barnyard from the Seizoen Bretta base are also easily appreciated. Bitter peach skin is more apparent than the sweet peach flesh and thats a good thing since it adds a layer of complexity. Good wood, nice funk, cracker base malt. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. No way I would have guessed this a point over 8%. Very dry with minimal residual sweetness. No real discernible sourness. A little tartness is there but Im attributing that to the natural twang found in the fresh fruit instead of lactic acid. Id classify this as a fruited saison with brett but not a sour/wild. If there are some bugs in there they havent manifested themselves yet.","St Helens, Oregon, USA","hopsbreath"
3136,"2012-05-13",4.1,"Bottle...  Poured pale, golden, light juice color with a lacy head.  Nose had some nice brett characters, oak, and peach juice.  Tart, mildly acidic with woody, earthy, yeast spice flavors.  Peach tartness with brett funk.  Not overly horseblankey-like, but just enough musk and brett to make it interesting.  Malt sweetness, floral, grassy, and more peach especially towards the finish.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
3136,"2012-05-10",3.7,"Hazy peach colour; good yellow head. Peach aoma, straw, Brettanomyces and fusels. Freshly grated Parmesan, dry peach, Brett, and a soft bitterness as from mouldy oranges. Sharpish carbonation, soft fruit filling. Quite good, nice fruit combination.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
