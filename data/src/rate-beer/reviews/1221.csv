1221,"2015-10-11",3.6,"Bottle. Pours dark brown with an average off-white head. Aroma of caramel, raisins, and nuts. Flavor was rich & sweet with caramel, dark fruit, raisins, toffee and nuts. A good doppelbock.","Croydon, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerdedone"
1221,"2015-05-25",3.8,"Pours dark brown, bit of foam, nice malty look. Aroma has barrels, wow, barrel aged doublebock, my first ever. Bit of spikey alcohol, tastes interestingly mild, bourbon comes through and kicks you a bit. Later lingers nicely with some hops and bitterness. Somewhat edgy finish.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
1221,"2015-05-25",3.8,"Bottle from the brewery 9 months ago. Nose of oak, vanilla, bourbon, big malts, crackers, caramel, chocolate. Glowing amber-orange. rich and full flavor and body, mellow and smooth. Bock character remains. Good.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
1221,"2015-05-22",3.8,"chestnut color. Sweet malty nose with butterscotch, toffee and cherries, with subtle barrel aging. Big smooth malty mouth, butterscotch, slightly boozy with toffee and milk chocolate finish. Sooo smooth, lots of subtlness but such great depth. Nice lingering dark fruit and toffee finish. Slightly boozy. Absolutely lovely.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
1221,"2014-12-05",4.0,"Bottle. Pours coca cola brown with a beige head. Aroma is chocolate, molasses, vanilla, bourbon. Flavor is caramel, molasses, lots of vanilla leading to bourbon, and finishing with a bit of oak dryness.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
1221,"2014-12-05",3.8,"550 ml thanks to Willrunforbeer, much thanks Brian. Stored properly since the release ( spring of last year) Deep ruby color with a thin ring of white head. Aroma is laced with dark fruits (lots of plums and dates) and and subtle bourbon and vanilla. 
Plums and dates show up right at the front of the sip with more dark fruit/ raisin hints followed by figs and caramel sticky sweetness. The bourbon is subtle with vanilla oak and roasted nuts with sticky mouthfeel. The flavor is sweet but layered, the bourbon really helps with the balance.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

1221,"2014-10-13",3.6,"Bottle: Thanks, Jason. Deep, mostly clear chestnut brown body with the thinnest beige collar that outlines the top. Nice aroma of sticky toffee, caramel candy, light prunes, some mild vanilla, a small hint of roast, & a slight robust booziness, although I wouldnt guess bourbon. I also wouldnt guess that it was indeed a barrel aged beer. Smells like a big-ass doppelbock. Flavor full of sweet Munich malts, cocoa dust, toffee, sticky caramel, brown sugar coated plums, a touch of roast, light apple. Again, I dont get much barrel aging from the flavor, either. Its robust, but not explicitly boozy, & it goes down pretty well for being relatively ""big"" in both ABV & heft. Slightly sticky mouth feel. Overall, makes for a pretty nice ""American"" doppelbock, even though the barrel aging is very mute.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Bottle: The aroma consists of chocolate, caramel, raisin, with a hint of vanilla. It pours a transparent dark copper with a small off-white head that quickly fades to a very thin ring around the edges of the glass. The flavor starts with chocolate, caramel, and light toffee. The finish has some molasses, raisin, and a hint of vanilla. Its medium bodied with mild carbonation and a slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, I get a touch of vanilla, but I dont get much barrel aging.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
1221,"2014-08-30",3.9,"Pours a mahogany brow with tan head. Aroma is nutty, vanilla, light mocha, caramel, and light spices. Taste is medium sweet with nice whiskey character. Probably didnt do this beer justice by drinking it after BA old stock which was similar but a bit stronger so the palate was washed out.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
1221,"2014-08-25",4.2,"Pours deep mahogany into a willi. Tan head with good retention recedes to skim surface. Hot caramel, bourbon and vanilla aromas. Thick with sweet chocolate-covered caramel, oak, pit fruit and vanilla upfront turning to hot bourbon in the lasting finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"

1221,"2014-08-18",3.3,"A boozy feel not aided by the barreling but ok overall. Has some of the malty dopplebock sense but the barrels kill the character of this beer and whiskey dominates. If you like whiskey, a great beer. Pours mahogany.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
1221,"2014-08-17",3.8,"Caramel and pecan aroma. Hazy copper, thin head. Doughy caramel flavor, not a lot of barrel character. Medium to full body. A tasty bock and one I can get into.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"

1221,"2014-08-16",4.0,"Bottle thanks to WillRunForBeer! Muddy reddish-brown color with a small foamy head that quickly collects to a foamy ring. Spotty lacing. Excellent aroma of vanilla, bourbon cherries, oak, toasted dark bread, burnt caramel, raisins, and light licorice. Bourbon is bigger in the taste than the aroma. Slightly hot bourbon with tons of vanilla and dark fruit. Complemented by dark bread, caramel, maple, and brown sugar. Thin to medium body. A little syrupy and boozy. Great doppelbock but if the bourbon was a little softer this would be amazing.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
1221,"2014-07-31",3.6,"50cl bottle pours a clear, garnet amber with some spitty, creamy, white head. Nose has dried cherry, a fair amount of wet malt, some clove, a little maple.

1221,"2014-05-31",4.1,"500ml bottle pours dark ruby red brown with light edges and a finger of head. Nose is earthy dark bread, subtle dark fruits, light spicy malt and a hint of bourbon. Taste is rich creamy bready malt, like liquid bread, date, plum, grape, little bourbon, creamy oaky vanilla. Finish is vanilla, dark wheat bread, subtle bourbon spice, wood. Hint of bourbon booze spice in the nose as it warms. Great stuff. These guys just keep cranking out hits.","Hampton Roads, Virginia, USA","JBPortland"

Hazy dark amber, thick head, full retention. Nose and taste are similar and big. Plenty of dark fruit, lots of graham crackers, cola and malty character. Very smooth rich mouthfeel, at the back comes in some warming alcohol, but its not hot and it works. A bit nutty lots of dark fruit. Outstanding.","Rochester, New York, USA","jb"

1221,"2013-12-30",3.9,"In short: A creamy malty dark beer with the sweetness and barrels kept in check. Good beer.
How: Growler shared at post HF FoFA 2013 party.
The look: Burgundy body topped by a persistent beige head.
In long: Big malty nose that is really not so bourbonny. In mouth the beer has a full body with doughy texture and a medium carbonation, pleasant mouthfeel. Taste is rich, creamy malts, raisins, toffee, some dark fruits, some maple syrup, some wood, some vanilla, mild bourbon notes. A big malty beer that I enjoyed because it is rich and nourishing without feeling very sweet and the barrel aging adds flavors without overwhelming the beer. Im trying to be friendly at tastings but its weird how it seems to make my friends uncomfortable when I lightly touch their arm and whisper to their ears I feel really comfortable drinking with you.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
