1305,"2012-09-14",3.7,"Growler shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike!

Currently the #1 ESB.

The beer is slightly hazy and a light brown color, with nearly an inch of tan head that leaves ample lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is malty, with some dank hop scents, almost rubbery smelling. The flavor is pleasant and the beer is quite easy to drink. Moderate hop bitterness emerges in the finish. The beer concludes fairly dry. Overall, a nice brew, and one I would have again.

Serving type: growler

1305,"2011-08-21",3.4,"Growler filled at Big Z and consumed the next day.  Pours a lightly hazed amber with a thin-moderate tan head that faded by the second sip and left very little lace.  Weak aroma of malt along with some very light pine notes.  The flavor is thankfully more defined than the aroma with malt, toasted bread, and light caramel followed by some moderately bitter hops.  Medium bodied.  Ok, but Id frankly rather have a Fullers.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"

1305,"2011-08-11",3.4,"A: The pour is a slightly hazed amber color with a finger of white head.

S: A very interesting aroma.  Its got a touch of juniper berries, herbal hops, and pine to go with a solid amount of bready hops and a touch of banana.  Very mild yeast notes.

T: There is a good balance of bitterness and maltiness.  Sweet bread and toffee malts with a light bitterness to go with the grassy and herbal hops.  Some more juniper berry flavor.

M: Medium in body with a medium carbonation.

O: A more interesting ESB than Im accustomed to.  Not bad.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
1305,"2011-08-04",3.6,"Huge thanks to cosmicevan for getting me a growler of this. Finally, the 2-plus-year wait is finally over. Currently the #1 ESB. Served in a Mikasa tulip at our Christmas in July tasting.

Pours a dark copper color with a great, great off-white head with loads of lacing on the way down. Nice cap and collar throughout. The nose brings some caramel and bready malt and actually a bit of light roastiness, which is a bit strange. Light nuttiness there as well along with some earthy and herbal hops.

The flavor takes down the malt a touch and focuses slightly more on the hops. Good blend of hop flavor and bready malt. Light toast as well. Medium body with good carbonation and a very nice bitterness in the finish. Not quite the best ESB that Ive ever had -- that honor goes to FFF Lord Admiral Nelson -- but this is a good beer, albeit not one worth a several-year wait.

Bitterness on the front is standard for an American ESB with some of the maltiness found in the better examples of this style. Light body. Although, I’m not a fan of Blue Point this is a good effort.","New York, USA","JCastner"

Flavor begins with an initial flavor of caramel and malts but then quickly goes to a hoppy and bitter middle with a sweet and fruity aftertaste and some lingering bitterness from the hops. Excellent brew.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"
1305,"2006-09-22",3.9,"ohh very nice beer.  Plastic sample cup at the brewery.  Small head that quickly turns into lacing.  Amber color and can see through it.  Present aroma of light roastiness, very earthy and toasty.  Nice malt in this puppy.  Taste is moderately toasty sweet.  Low but present bitterness at the end to round things off.  Leaves a really fruity, sweet aftertaste. Really good level of carbontation allowing a proper enjoyment of this beer.  This really might be the best beer Blue Point makes.  I really recommend it.  This also may be the best ESB I have every tried.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Full bodied and no lacing. Light roast smell and maybe a fruity hint. When you first drink it it is originally sweet with some hop characters but then it ends slightly dry which allows in to have more character in my opinion.

1305,"2003-12-27",4.4,"Growler.  This is the type of ESB that reminds me of Troegs ESB, which I loved so much.  It is a nice deep clear amber color with a great head.  Aroma is of hops hops and more hops- probably some willamette.  Flavor is of nice caramel malt and spicy/ yet subdues hops, while the finish is smooth and leaves a little bitter bite.

Wonderful aroma, like a strawberry ""Orange Julius"" drink (if you happen to know that old chain of frothy fruit-drink makers).  First tastes are of quality hops, full and fragrant.  But the body is watery thin, a massive disappointment, and as the beer warmed it provided a weak finish as well.  (hand-pull cask at Gingerman, NYC)","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
