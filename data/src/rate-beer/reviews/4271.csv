The billowy head is an interesting touch to this golden lager, the wet hay aroma is about right for the style. A very good American take on the helles style. Perhaps not as ""clean"" tasting due to an a light-moderate, earthy hop snap to flush out basic grain flavor.

4271,"2017-03-17",3.4,"16oz can. 2/16/17 can date. Appearance: Golden and mostly clear with a slight touch of haze, and a moderate frothy white foam head. 
Aroma: Doughy, bready, with a touch of floral, spicy hops

Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy bodied for the style, with a moderate carbonation
Finish: Strong lingering spicy hop bitterness dominates. Dry, with little evidence of the malt. 
Overall: A really nice crisp lager with a bit of body, but waaay too hoppy to fit in the Helles style. Has the bitterness of an overly aggressive Dortmunder or maybe more so a Pilsner. Closer to a Czech pils because of the more robust malt base","","TH28"

4271,"2016-10-08",2.9,"Can (Sep 01, 2016 canning).

Head is initially average sized, frothy/fizzy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy medium yellow.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately hoppy (flowers, herbs, apricot), with light notes of gum, pineapple juice.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, lightly alcoholic. 

It mostly resembles an Americanized Koelsch, or even a sweet APA or blonde ale...Helles and certainly Zwickel/Kellerbier is pushing it pretty far beyond its outward character (despite certainly being unfiltered). Simple/mild malt profile...its more hoppy and estery than malty. And yes, its got a pretty distinct fruity/estery ale-like character, not very lager-like to me at all. Even Stone Wussie is more authentic smelling than this. Its not a bad beer, though, and while the sweetness lingers too long into the finish, there is just enough bitterness to at least keep it drinkable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

4271,"2016-06-10",3.0,"From notes. I had this one on draft at Buffalo Wild Wings in Milwaukee for a work trip. The pour is a nice foggy golden yellow with a big fluffy white head. It takes a long time for this one to fall down, leaving some great lacing up and down the glass. The aroma is pretty basic. There is a definite lager aroma to this. Its got a strong metallic malt and a sweetness thats a little off. There is a little bit of a grassiness that I think is probably the best quality. The flavor isnt good. This one tastes old. There is a strong metallic maltiness and a lingering lagery earthiness to it. The grassiness fades a bit, and the sweet maltiness just takes over. The mouth feel is thicker and carries a strange carbonation. Its voluminous, but not really crisp. The aftertaste is lingeringly sweet with a bitter maltiness that doesnt really fit in.

Crisp smell with notes of cloves. I also detected what can best be described as grapes in the smell. Almost like someone hid a little bit of white wine in a can of beer. 

The taste was surprisingly subtle for a Surly beer. Yes, its a lager but Ive been surprised by the attitude of pretty much every other Surly beer Ive tried. Has a aftertaste of apple, and of malt - the later of which lingers for quite a while. I also picked up on quite a bit of sourness, which certainly did not work for me.

Carbonation is heavy to begin with, but dissipates quickly. Generally speaking, I enjoyed the feel of this much more than the subtle taste. 

I probably wont return to this, but if Im ever at the Surly Taproom and have to recommend a beer to someone who considers anything darker than Grain Belt an abomination - then this is the one. Otherwise, there are much better lagers from Minnesota.","Minnesota, USA","Nels0wn"

The carbonation looks to be quite high as I can see CO2 bubbles rising like crazy in the glass. The aroma is perfumy and reminiscent of raspberry. The taste confirms what I smelled, the flavor is dominated by hop oil. Very little malt sweetness in the aftertaste perhaps because the hop oil is overpowering. All in all, a decent American microlager, but not German in any way and very much unlike a Zwickelbier. I guess that for the bunch of hopheads who brew this, Surly Hell would seem rather tame. News flash, guys, German Helles is never dry hopped.  This beer is proof to me that Surly should stick to its extreme ales as they do not know how to brew a German lager.

4271,"2015-04-18",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Pleasant cereals envelop this Helless subtle herbal hops in a polished and super drinkable example of the style.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the misty pale golden.
-Carbonation is prickly and does not evoke classic Helles served in Germany.
-Hops are subdued, as they should be.
-Malts dont necessarily point to Germany either, but they are nicely developed from aroma to finish.
-Mouthfeel is lean, leading to high drinkability.

4271,"2015-03-10",3.1,"Surly is one of those breweries I always associate with high quality across the board. Since I cant get their stuff regularly here in NY, every beer of theirs Ive tried has been really good. Therefore, it comes as a shock to me that Surly Hell, is rather mediocre and average. It tastes eerily like a lot of a generic pale lager; mild-tasting with a slight tang on the finish (almost as if it were old beer, but the can is quite fresh). I dont know what happened with this one, but Im not impressed.

I poured a 16oz can into a lager glass. It was canned on 1/22/15 and was sent to me by Matthew L. (thanks yet again!).

Appearance: Clear shade of clear gold with consistent carbonation visible. Pours to a small, white, soapy head which mostly evaporates and leaves no lacing.

Smell: Just a generic lager aroma. Nothing off-putting at least.

Taste: Im not sure if this beer should be considered a Munich Helles Lager or a Zwickel (according the description), but either way its not especially German in character. Its much closer to American pale lager with a mild, slightly grainy base flavor. I got no distinctive flavors as far as malts or hops, which is a little odd since its brewed with American rather than German hops. On the backend theres a slight tang or metallic character. Cheap adjunct brews tend to have this as well, only much stronger. Whats here is more than tolerable; its not off-putting, but Im struggling trying to find a quality about it I genuinely enjoy.

Drinkability: Hell is the German word for light (in color), but in the case of Surly Hell it would probably refer to the flavor and body. Light but not paper thin; crisp but not overly spastic. Its somewhat refreshing while in the mouth and leaves a clean aftertaste. At 4.5% its indeed sessionable, but Id want more flavor to do that.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Aroma: The aroma has some grains and light hops, that are mostly herbal and grassy

This could also quite possibly be a great transition beer for those looking to get into the craft beer world. Rumblings of Surly wanting to expand a bit continues through the midwest and heres hoping that they make it south to the lovely state of Iowa.

Poured from a pint can.

A: Pours a golden straw with slight haze to it. You cant see through it, but you can see all the great carbonation bubbles zip to the top of the glass. Pours a nice fluffy white head that subsides into a thin top-coating film.

S: I definitely pick up the bready pilsner malts along with a slight flowery/fruityness that finishes the smell. Not so much yeasty though.

T: Solid cracker malts with a nice subtle yeast backbone. Im picking up some slight fruity tartness as well that makes the finish a little bit of a zing. The yeast also makes an appearance, but its very subtle. 

M: Great carbonation with a medium to light body. Crisp and prickly on the tongue.

O: This is my first Surly offering and I really liked this lager. It was very well balanced lager and I liked the traditional aspects about it. Good work Surly, now Im ready for some more.

Taste really isnt much to write home about.  Dont expect a huge flavorful ale kind of taste here.  Because well thats not what they were trying to do here.  They tried to create a nice sessionable and enjoyable brew and they did a hell of a job doing so.  Up front from me what the grassy hoppy flavor followed by the nice little fruity taste.

In addition to these scents theres also plenty of bread dough scent.  Some honey character with warming.  Flavor has the edge over the aroma, as there is a very pleasant crackery, bready flavor coupled with some sweet honey butter, that ends quite crisply with some grassy and spicy hops that are paired with a quick minerally finish.  Tastes like a helles to me.  Mouthfeel is smooth and carbonation is lively.  Overall this is a well-crafted lager that surprisingly isnt hopped to hell and back.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

Green grass and lemon in the middle. Crunchy grains along the edges, bread crusts. Slow growing bitterness. Solid moist chewy breads underneath with gentle sweetness. Is that key-lime? Lemon peel.

It pours a nice golden color with a foamy white head. This is actually one of the best looking American-made helles beers I have seen.

The smell is a downer. They dont seem to be using German hops. It is okay in the smell.

The flavor again isnt that much in a normal Helles territory. It is a bit sweet for the style and the hop flavors are a bit off.

For an American brewery trying to squirm out a Helles lager it is a better attempt than most but American brewers have a lot to learn if they want to make a quality Helles.

Aroma is some grassy hops, bread & cracker malt, lightly herbal and floral, overall strength is moderate at best.

Flavor is sweet bready malt, a bit of caramel, light grassy hops that offer just a hint of bitterness but sweetness dominates the profile.  Fairly straightforward but offers a good amount of flavor for the style and goes down very nicely.

  Nothing amazing that scares the palate or dazzels the nose, just a solid beer that becomes a enjoyable session beer.  Whisps of enjoyable citrus hops float around the background to this amazingly well balanced beer.  Not something that will become the next big craze (cough... fat tire) but a nice beer I would be happy to have again.
  My only question is how much does it costs? A four pack would go down nicely, but I would have trouble paying the average $10 craft pack cost if I could get a sixer of, say, gumball head instead.  Have to say though, the appearance was about as perfect as Surly could have hoped for... appearance alone does not make the beer, I know.

The taste has the same clean citrus hop presence up front which gives way to the toasted bread of the underlying malt base.  The corn sweetness is more prevalent in the taste and lingers through the finish with a dry bready character as well.

4271,"2009-10-25",3.6,"Tap @ Darkness Day - Copper pour with a little white head. Smell is apple, sweet bready malt, and just a hint of sourness. Taste is roughly the same, but the apple flavor is a bit more forward. In fact, had you told me this was brewed with apples, Id probably believe you. The lightness of taste and the slight syrupy feeling works well  together, and this was a great beer to have after drinking the mouth onslaught that is Darkness. I know this is tough to get for out-of-staters, but Id pick this up if I could get it locally.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

4271,"2009-10-18",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2011 In short: A clean and well balanced filling blonde session lager.  Feels authentic.
How: Can 500ml.  Consumed fresh some time ago a few weeks after receiving it from hellomynameis.  Thanks a lot Zac
The look: Clear blonde body topped by a very small white head
In long: Nose of fresh bakery bread with grassy hops.  Taste is really true lager.  I know all micro lagers are true lagers but some just come through with that cool fresh European lager character that I too rarely find from north-american breweries.  Fresh bakery bread, egg white (sounds weird but I get that from many kellerbier), a light crystal malt sugary sweetness, a good amount of grassy hops.  The finish bring a medium intensity bitterness and a medium dryness with a little crushed aspirins flavour that I could have done without.  Long finish.  The beer is very clean but not crisp.  Actually it feels rather doughy, pleasantly so.  Underrated, like just about all true lagers on raterbeer.  Certainly the most authentic north-american lager sold in a can.  To quote the marketing team of poets at Anheuser-Busch, I was happy to get it in the can.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Organic looking splotches and flares of lacing mark the glass.  The nose shows crusty, fresh from the hearth bread, pils malt, lemongrass spices, and a light dose of peppery, green, grassy hops.  Flavors follow suit, taking on a sort of ""liquid bread"" profile, just ultra-fresh with loads of lightly sweet, clean grain malt.  The grassy hops lend great balance, green bitterness, citrus rind, and white pepper spices serving as the perfect counterpoint to the malt.  Smooth and substantial, the palate sports a zippy carbonation that intensifies the peppery spice.  Damn, this is just tasty as can be.  I need to get more of this.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The hops were almost non-existent compared to other Surly products. I thought it was very enjoyable and easy to drink.","Valhalla, Minnesota, USA","akevitt"
4271,"2008-09-21",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2010 Rerate. 1 pint can, courtesy of MatSciGuy. Thanks, Levi! Pours a bright, clear yellow color with high clarity and light effervescence; creamy white head with good retention and lacing. Minerally, spicy bitterness in the aroma, along with a soft, toasty maltiness; crisp and mouthwatering. Medium-light body; lively carbonation; lightly creamy; perfect mouthfeel, with a light acidity, crisp and refreshing; medium, toasty maltiness and a slight pepperiness, seemingly (possibly from the yeast); modest levels of a mineral and herbal bitterness, following the aroma; lively, crisp, and hugely sessionable beer with a solid mineral bitterness and nicely toasty Pils malt; hugely tasty stuff. Medium finish of minerals, toastiness, and a hint of a green olive note; nicely crisp finish.

Draft @ Acadia Cafe.  Pours a hazy, bright yellow color; creamy, textured white head with excellent retention and fine-bubbled lacing; great pour.  Crisp, dry citrus and mineral bitterness in the aroma; clean, dry lager.  Relaxed carbonation.  Medium mouthfeel: crisp, clean upfront showing citrus and minerals and touches of bread; toasty and ultimately dry at the core; nicely done and very drinkable.

Usually the aromas of lagers are off putting but this was nice, light with hops and also had some good yeast aroma.  Appearance was a pale yellow with a white head.  Flavor is well balanced of all traditional ingredients and was impressed how well it tasted.  Palate is smooth and makes a great session beer.","Bemidji, Minnesota, USA","kosko20"

4271,"2008-08-29",3.1,"On tap, Happy Gnome. Pale golden color, foamy head dissipates quickly. Aroma is faint to none. Flavor is surprising for such a light style. Sweet caramel maltiness, a bit of roast. Bad news lurks deep within though, with some minor off notes reminiscent of American swill. That being said, it’s still good. Mild floral hop finish. Medium bodied, a bit fizzy on the palate. Overall pretty well done.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","WisconsinBeer"
4271,"2008-08-29",3.7,"Tap at the Gnome.  Lightly misty golden blonde, and a resilient whitecap.  Clean, sweet aroma of honey and almond creme.  Pineapple and cotton candy in the hoppier moments, and boiled corn and cauliflower in the fouler american lager moments.  Brisk for the most part, though, and healthfully herbal and quite dry.

Flavor is crisp and taut in refreshment, showing pistachios, honey, green tea, white bread and dry grass; not as much cleansing bitterness as might be hoped for from a keller, but there’s certainly enough wooden and cereal-like character to the malt to compensate.  


Palate is clean and elegant; full in texture, but sprightly in affectation; finishes crisply with dry green hoppiness and a bit of bubblegum.  Extremely quaffable; maybe a better dortmunder than a keller, really, but still a fine offering.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
4271,"2008-08-25",3.1,"I am not a huge lager guy either,Al. Never thought I would see a Surly that pours the exact color of a Mich Golden. Taste is smooth, light on everthing, hops, malt, aroma. Nothing that makes you go ""wow"", but i doubt anyone could make this style do that. My wife liked this quite a bit of course. I think if this beer was relased by any brewery but Surly, it would be swept aside as yet another boring, bland, yellow beer. Surly succeeds in what they were trying to brew, a tasty, light, German ""Hell""","Woodbury, Minnesota, USA","incutrav"
4271,"2008-08-25",3.8,"""Surly Hell is brewed in the style of a German Light Lager or Munich Helles. Pale Yellow in color, this unfiltered lager or ""kellerbier"" is brewed with Pilsen and Carahell malt, Opal hops and a German yeast strain. Delicate malt flavor finishing with a tart crispness. 15 IBU.

Hazy straw yellow, big, lovely white head...
Beautiful aromatics, floral, herbal,.....a trifle grainy...but altogether pleasing. 

to drink: bing: there’s the smooth. Bang: there’s the malt, and Boom:...there’s no Boom...just the smooth and the malt, and some light hops, plus the deliciousness of the yeast.

Disclosure: To those who don’t know already, I’m not a lager lover. Just not enough flavor. I’m partial to unfiltered brews, as well. Like Belgian ales,  some German ales, certain Americans...like Surly...wait, Surly made a 
German lager...and it’s unfiltered? Sign me up...wait, I’m already drinking it...oh, okay...

I do like kellerbiers, when I find them. Can’t think of one I haven’t liked. Kep that yeast in, please! More flavor, por favor!

And here I am drinking Hell (a name I wish they’d saved for an abbey ale, or something, but I’m not charge, am I?)...and I am enjoying it. If this had zero yeast in it, I probably would report the doldrums by now, but there’s just enough going on in the mouth to keep my tastebuds happy. 

Drining this sample from a tall Schneider Edel-Weisse glass. Seemed appropriate.

After several big beers from Surly I was ready for something different.  I happened to be in the area and decided to give this a try.  If it were local this would be a top notch lawnmower beer.  Some people may knock it for not being extreme but if you can make a solid light style like this you can do anything.

Aroma / Appearance - Semitransparent and fluid this twirled around the glass like the a ballerina on stage.  Smoky orange zest blended with lemony hops and a malty backbone to create a refreshing aura.

Flavor / Palate - Refreshing on the palate this clears the heaviness from the throat immediately.  A zesty lemon taste fills the mouth and throat before fading fast.  I could drink this all day if it were canned.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
4271,"2008-08-10",3.0,"Small sample, on tap at Great Taste of the Midwest. Consumed on 8-9-2008. Pours hazy gold with near-white head. Hoppy, yeasty smell. Tastes too ""beery"" (i.e., like a typical macro pale lager). Pretty standard golden lager flavor, save for a nice, lemony finish. Improves on multiple sips, making me think Ill like this better when I have a full glass instead of just a few ounces (at least I hope thats the case). Light to medium body. For now, this is my least favorite beer from one of my favorite breweries, but I certainly plan to give it another chance.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

The flavor had a dry bready core with fresh floral and spicy yeast layered throughout.. lemony notes showed on the back.  Drier and yeasty on the palate with a refreshing finish.. crisp and well-balanced.. this would be an awesome lawnmower beer!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Aroma of multi-golden grain malts, some flowery hops, and a touch of herbal spice. Taste is medium bodied, with flavors of mostly golden grain malt and a touch of white pepper and yeast. Finish has a malty golden grain aftertaste with a mild bitterness that quickly disappears. Not your typical Surly in-yer-face hop infused character, but an enjoyable lightly spiced Munich Helles style beer.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
