Tangy in the nose when it warms, too. Detracts  quite a bit, even though sourness peaked at a 2. The body is thin, losing some richness from the barrel. Medium body, mod carbonation. Not what I was hoping for.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

1312,"2012-05-08",3.1,"Draught  Medium to good yellow head over chestnut-coloured beer. Horrible chlorine-halogen nose - not from the beer but from the glass-washing - at the brewery, if you please! Whiff of Bourbon, finally. Sweet Bourbon-vanilla, wood, milk-chocolate, coloured malts and fruity, berry-like finish. Quite slick, medium to rather well-bodied, tad of alcohol.

1312,"2011-10-19",2.6,"Draft at Beer Revolution. Nice creamy head. Falls fairly quickly. Somewhat sour aroma. Flavor is strange. Reminds me of peanut SHELLS that you chew on by accident.

1312,"2011-06-08",3.8,"On tap at brewery.  Dark maple pour with thick but quickly dicipated head.  Nose is malt, toffee and fairly light bourbon.  Taste is fairly typical Scottish which to me is a Wee Heavy Light.  Nice crisp bite with very little sweetness.  Bourbon is light as well but just the right amount based on the other flavors and mouthfeel.  Very drinkable but dont think of this as a ""Big Beer"" since it weighs in at only 5.6%.","California, USA","48FanInCali"
1312,"2011-05-21",3.8,"On tap at Urge in RB/Poway on the Tap Takeover night. They had 25different brews from Ballast Point that day.

1312,"2011-04-21",2.6,"A: The pour is a dark amber color with about a finger of off-white/tan head.

S: A nice bourbon and vanilla aroma with a fair amount of oak. There is definitely some booziness and as it warms up, there is an increasingly noticeable acetone smell. Blah.

T: Strangely fruity, and a bit overcarbonated. Vanilla, oak, and a touch of bourbon. The same harshness and paint thinner thing is going on here.

M: Medium in body with a rather high level of carbonation.

O: I havent had very good luck with Ballast Points barrel aged beers. Add this one to that list.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

1312,"2011-03-28",3.4,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2011 On draft at Pizza Port.  Aroma of vanilla and caramel.  Beer is brown with little off-white head.  Quickly leaves no head and no lacing.  Taste is all bourbon, vanilla and caramel.  No Scotch ale detected as the bourbon barrel aging overpowered.  Overall, not bad because I like bourbon, but was hoping to get some Scotch ale flavors and did not.","Maryland, USA","hoosiers1994"
1312,"2011-03-16",3.6,"On tap at Ballast Point location north of San Diego.  This was a very unique beer.  Having not tried the regular Piper Down beer, Im not sure how much of the character is coming from the bourbon barrels, but there was a strong vanilla presence in the aroma.  Sweet and and strong vanilla with some other sticky, smokey malt characteristics.  The flavors included all of the aromas, but also a certain earthy, sour character that was completely unexpected.  The sourness must be a part of the original scotch ale underneath, but it made this beer very unique.  Not sure how I felt about it - I know I couldnt drink much more than a small glass.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","shadey"
1312,"2011-03-06",3.6,"On tap at Papago last week in snifter from memory because I lost my fing notes.  Sample.  Amber/reddish with white ring.  Sweet caramel and fruit aroma.
