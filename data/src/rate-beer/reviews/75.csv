Appearance: Muddy brown with a small bubbly off-white head and little lacing. 

Aroma: Spices, maple syrup, chocolate, berries, boozy notes, honey and herbs. Not as unbalanced as it sounds though.

Taste: Sweet and spicy with chocolate, herbal presence, honey, berries, maple syrup and alcohol.

Palate: Medium to full body. Moderate carbonation. A bit oily and sirupy mouthfeel. Warming finish. Long lasting spicy aftertaste. 

Overall: As expected, this isnt a masterpiece of balance but it was a lot better than I thought it would be. I *almost* liked it, which is already very good for a beer from the Spice/Herb/Vegetable category. Not exactly easily drinkable.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Sweet, sweet toffee, stale caramel, prune, earth, light anise, some figs. A hint of red grape, booze, caramel, & oxidation in the finish. Not awful but definitely past its prime.

Aroma of earth, kitchen spices, mild papery oxidation, pepper, stale caramel, light toffee, a touch of anise, faint fig.

The 2009 was much better but still not as good as the fresher 2013 one I had.  2009 had a nice maple syrup aroma and flavor come through.

Oily, viscous, syrupy, big bodied, low carb (almost flat), with a long minty earthy and floral finish.

Bottle graciously gifted by afdempse right after it was released. I pulled this out of the cellar to share with Mike and Mike the other day.

The beer is dark brown with amber highlights. The head is thin, leaving only sparse lacing. 

The nose offers heavy spices, most notably juniper berries, as well as both a heavy hop and malt presence. 

The flavor brings floral, pine, resin, earth, juniper berries, sweet alcohol, malt, and various other spices. Wow, this is a complex brew.

The body is light to medium, with moderately low carbonation.

Overall, a fun and interesting brew. Its certainly worth a try. Ideal to split a few ways, as a few ounces was plenty.

In long: Nose is oxidized (wet cardboard), spicy, minerals, sweetness and overall just plain off.  Taste is syrupy, thick caramel, too much spiciness, molasses,  oily toffee, cardboard.  Very sticky mouthfeel.  Was the bottle too old or was it just not my type of beer.  I dont know but one thing is certain I didnt like this bottle.

75,"2011-02-16",4.3,"Reviewed from notes. Consumed in March 2010.

Pours a light, red-hued amber color with a pretty good head considering the alcohol volume. Nose is really nice, bringing a good deal of sweetness along with pine, black licorice, gin-type flavors, and some floral aspects. Taste really brings out the juniper and black licorice with a touch of sweetness in the background. All the spices and herbs come together to create a nice, dry feel. Drinks quite well and is one of the few super-spiced beers that I have thoroughly enjoyed.

75,"2011-01-05",2.9,"Big thanks to Shogokawada for this one. This beer wasnt even on my radar, I didnt really know about it actually. 

On the pour it is evident that this beer is a deep, nutty red but it collects in the glass very near to black. The edges display the beers actual color and lack of turbidity.  Not much in terms of head, but this beast is 12.1%. 

Woof! The first whiff would have staggered a lesser man. The paint on the walls is beginning to peel and all the house plants have wilted. All of its sweetness reminds me of different kinds of strange, old man candies. Rum-raisin, licorice, molasses, black salt water taffy and various other depression era sweets. The alcohol is obviously pretty potent as well. Its responsible for an aerosol propellant aroma, luckily its pretty buried. There is a syrupy aroma as well. What ever Hawberries are, they are giving this beer a boysenberry/mixed berry syrup aroma. Maple becomes stronger as it warms, which really knocks this up a few notches. The latter aromas give me a craving for waffles. 

I think the flavors are way too all over the place, however. A rough hoppiness teams up with abrasive alcohol and a chemically flavor. The middle sweetens up with lots of molasses, maple and berries. The end is full of licorice, bitterness, roastiness, and hoppiness with a medicinal finish. 

Understandably this is a hot beer meant for sipping slowly. While I was working on reviewing the flavor I found myself sipping too quickly, now my mouth and palate are fatigued, feeling numbed. In all though, this beer finishes pretty smooth and clean, for what it is. Carbonation seems about right, especially after copious swirling and plenty of time to breath. 

One cant help but to make associations between this and Batch 10,000. In some respects this is similar. They both have a lot going on at once. I prefer this over BTK though.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","MbpBugeye"

A: The pour is a dark chestnut sort of color with a fingers worth of khaki colored head.

S: A very surprising amount of oxidation to this beer. Lots of stale brown sugar notes and stale hop character. Some mild cardboard to go with it. Theres still some decent sweetness from some toffee and molasses and a fair amount of roast.

T: Theres a surprising level of bitterness to this beer, with a bit of an earthy hop character. Mostly molasses, in terms of the sugars, with a fair amount of licorice. Theres quite a bit of alcohol to it, especially as it warms up.

M: The body is medium with a moderate carbonation and alcohol heat on the finish.

75,"2010-06-19",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2011 Another MI gem from Derek, 12oz bottle, 2006 vintage, poured into a tulip.  7/3/7/4/14

The pour is a murky dark brown with a creamy beige head that lingers as a collar for a while and leaves some legs on the sides.  Its a bit disconcerting though as there a ton of floaties in the glass, almost chunks in fact.

The aroma is certainly interesting with the vegetables and spices (coriander and nutmeg maybe?) hitting my nose first.  There is a light sweet spiciness from the honey and more than a hint of chocolate and lots of dark fruits.

The taste is even weirder, with a crazy spiciness hitting the tongue up front.  Really tough to place the specific taste though. Definitely some spices, juniper maybe, other spices as well.  The backbone is dark malts, honey and dark fruit and the finish brings back the odd spiciness.

The mouthfeel is full bodied and sticky sweet but with the overpowering spiciness leaving a tingling on the palate.

This is one of the more interesting beers Ive had in a long time.  Lots of odd spiciness, honey, fruits and, of course, the weird inclusion of cooked vegetables.  Not my favorite Bells brew but glad I got to try it.

2009 bottle.  8/4/7/4/14

Thanks, of course, to Derek for this one.

Pours really really dark chocolate brown, not far from stout territory, with a thick beige head that sticks around as a thin cap and leaves some sticky legs on the sides.

The aroma is like a slightly spiced English barleywine or old ale.  Its got some thick syrup, caramel and toffee sweetness which is mixed with the interesting spiciness and dark fruits.  Strong aroma on this one.

The taste is more of the same - really big and boozy.  Its got the sweet syrup and caramel malt backbone with a spiced fruit flavor as well as a healthy earthy hop bitterness.  Its slightly medicinal to be honest with a lot of heat in the finish.

The mouthfeel is bitter and sticky with syrup and hops on the palate.

This is one of those kitchen sink beers where there is just a ton of different flavors and ingredients that dont exactly come together perfectly.  That said, I enjoyed it, but its a sipper to be sure.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Here the nose is dominated by prunes, raisins, licorice, cherry Twizzlers, spicy alcohol, nice complexity. I cant really name all the flavors going on here. Taste is not too medicinal, cough syrup, cloying sweetness you get with some of these types. Instead the body is wickedly rich maple, honey, maple candies. The hops here have either faded or do nothing but mask the 11% incredibly well. Numbing, coating mouthfeel. Soft carbonation.

A rich flavor of so many things; roasted malts, sweet spicy flavors, a bit of oxidation, a trace of hops and a rich dark fruit. Really interesting, the kind of beer I need to try multiple times to figure out. Very nice.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
75,"2009-08-08",3.8,"2006 bottle; Sampled August 2009
A solid pour produces a two finger thick, nicely brown tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is a dark brown, concentrated amber color.  When held up to the light the beer shows a murky, dark plum color.  The aroma smells of richly concentrated malt, dark fruit and even some brandy notes.  The dark, concentrated fruit notes are the most prevalent here and remind me of raisins, roasted prunes and some Concord grape notes all of which are a little broiled.  There are some spicy notes here that in combination with the warm alcohol produces notes of brandy, dark rum, and more than anything some bourbon-like notes.  Underneath the concentrated fruit notes are some richly toasted, brown sugar encrusted, whole grain bread notes.  There are some rich earthy notes here, a musty damp cellar like note, perhaps even a touch of lightly oxidized note (but really this could just be the rich fruit character).  The nose on this beer is incredibly rich and complex. 

Sweet and thick feeling as it first hits my tongue; this isnt quite as sweet as I might have guessed though.  The beer finishes with a mix of toasted grain, spicy alcohol, and even a bit of a tongue numbing sensation.  Rich, lightly oxidized, deeply caramelized malt character lingers on the tongue and mixes with a concentrated fruit notes of prune, brandy soaked dried figs and rich raisin notes.  The tongue numbing in the finish seems to be a mix of alcohol and turpene like effects (even some clove notes).  This beer is just incredibly rich, it is quite the sipping brew with lots of strength, though it is not overly hot.  A touch of astringency and spice to the finish reminds me of a hint of oak, and perhaps even some oaky Bourbon.

This beer seems to make my ears tingle with warmth.  I do wonder what the vegetables add to this beer, and what vegetables were actually used.  The beer is not quite as complex in the flavor as it is in the nose.  This is a very interesting beer, definitely quite enjoyable.  It could perhaps hide its strength just a little bit better, but it is still quite nice.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Almost impossible to pick out everything thats happening in the nose. Toffee, molasses, mint, candy, even a bit of citrus? Super creamy mouthfeel, with a really intense and warming finish.

Sugary legging shows on the glass but leaves virtually no lace. The nose is ultra sweet, showing big notes of rum raisin, figs, dates, and brown sugar coated yams. Traces of oak and vanilla come throught as well. Flavors are intensely saccharine, notes of burnt marshmallow joining the brown sugar malts. Dark rum spiced with cinnamon, cardamom, and vanilla intensify the liquor-like feel. Lightly carbonated, hot, and syrupy, there are sign of oxidation, but imagine that the palate ismuch better when young.

I can never pick out specific notes from that range, so in addition, there is also a good deal of molasses, char, grass, honey, really crazy and I remain inept to do it justice. Flavor is more of the same, but not in any boring way, in more of a crazy flower-filled way, also with chocolate, smoke, but all those flower/herbal notes really are magical.

Nose is rich of caramel, candy sugar, dark fruits, alcohol, and mixes of spices. Initial taste is whooo....super sweet caramel, toffee and rich candy sugariness. Syrupy texture pours off the mouth. Mid palate is a sweet spice, dark fruits and liquorish. Finishing mildly hopped and dry chalky warming finish. Medium body, average palate duration. Leaves supersticky mouth and lips.

75,"2008-03-08",3.6,"Sample at the Bells tasting at Brews Cafe on 3/6/08 (2007 version): The beer is a murky dark brown color with a thin and foamy light beige head that diminishes quickly. Thin rings of lacing. Interesting aroma of resiny hops and sweet spices, plus some caramel and malt. Medium-bodied and smooth with flavors of caramel, anise, earthy malt and chocolate. The finish is moderately spiced with a mild alcohol and malt aftertaste. Pretty good overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
75,"2008-03-08",3.5,"On tap, 2007.  Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head.  Aroma is crazy.  So many different things going on in here.  Many of the aromas are familiar though it is hard to pinpoint what they are.  Candy, peppermint, chocolate, herbal, those little caramel candies with the white chewy center (this is the one that sticks out the most).  The aroma is definitely pleasing, though extremely unique and over the top.  Taste is a different experience.  Creamy, full-bodied, with an amalgamation of spices and flavors.  Chocolate, mint, cotton candy, a bunch of other stuff.  While the crazy spicing worked for me in the aroma I found the taste to be a little overspiced and everything became muddled.  Drinkability suffers from the intense combination of so many flavors.  Certainly an interesting and exciting beer but one I wouldnt want to drink too much of.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Quite a bit drier n the tongue than I expected. Starts sweet, turns slightly buttery midpalate and finishes rather bitter and dry.flavor is all over the place, very unique. Sweet, tart, dry.

Wow 6 years old!...Pours murky slightly orangish brown - I mean very murky. Lots of little stuff floating around. No head (or only a very slight trace). Kind of looks like old unfermented wort or unfiltered fall cider from the bottom of the vat. Hmmm. Smells of heavy candyish malt, sort of like a barleywine, but Im not getting any hops or spices. Palate is kind of heavy, virtually zero carbonation, so no zing, bubbliness or ""lift"". Flavor I would describe as sweet, spicey and bitter, all at the same time. Getting quite a gingery taste but there are probably other spices as well. Alcohol seems well-hidden in all the murk. Lingering bitter aftertaste. Pretty weird and quirky - seems almost like a homebrew experiment. Another hard one to rate because Im not sure what its supposed to ""be"" like and given the age of this bottle if it has started to turn into something different than when first bottled. Falls well out of the boundaries of a ""normal"" bottled beer.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"
75,"2008-01-26",4.0,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (2006 vintage) and served in a snifter.  This beer poured an extremely dark mahogany color with a thin, slightly lasting head of tan foam.  A fair amount of spotty lacing coated the inside of the glass.  The aroma of the beer was made up of strong caramel, chocolate, pie spices, honey, pumpkin, and a bit of alcohol.  The flavor was all over the place.  I picked up sugary caramel, buttered popcorn, licorice, prunes, maple syrup, bittersweet chocolate and cocoa, cinnamon, mild alcohol, and a strange vegetal note.  Eccentric to say the least.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and coated the tongue.  The level of carbonation was minimal.

A few big chunkies made it into my glass, but the vast majority I was able to keep in the bottle.  The nose is showing some age, with a fair amount of oxidation.  Lots of spicy notes, alcohol, brittle toffee candy, and resiny hops.  The flavor has a good bit of oxidation as well, but the really nice kind, imparting some sherry qualities to it, not papery or cardboardy at all.  Still quite bitter, and thats after 3 or 4 years, this must have been a hop monster when fresh.  Lots of dark alcohol soaked fruits with dates and figs primarily.  Some roasty notes and lots of spicy and herbal notes on the finish.  Noticable, but not overpowering alcohol.  Mouthfeel is quite thick and substantial, but not clingy or sticky at all.  The bitter finish lingers on forever.  Nice soft carbonation, but it was a little prickly.  Overall, this was quite good, and Id probably lean towards a Barley Wine or ASA rather than a spiced.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

75,"2007-09-04",4.1,"Rating 1000!!!! Bottle from Ross, thanks! Batch 6714. I have been a fan of Bells for a long time, and this has been on my wants list. Pours a deep muddy brown, and dense tan bubbles form a frothy dense head that dissipates to a wisp. I have not had such a beautiful poor from a Bells beer since Batch 7000. Complex aroma of nutmeg, cinnamon, cake, cherries, and some type of dried fragrant herb- sage maybe? Full bodied with fine but subtle carbonation. Initial flavor of caramel malt, dark fruits, and strong amounts of pumpkin spices. The hops join in blend in mid palate, as opposed to masking the initial flavors. Toward the end, I picked up some maple syrup and cookie. The alcohol is very apparent on the finish, but without overpowering this slow sipper. This warms the windpipe, and has some yeasty and earthy flavors that linger. To sum it up, this is like a spiced barleywine meets quad. Very unique and enjoyable.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"

9/04/2007:  Bells Eccentric Ale 2005 pours out in a smooth stream that is reddish/pecan (liquid bronze!) in color.  The beer is transparent in appearance with no head and little to no carbonation.  The aroma is syrupy and candy-like and reminds me of brandy-soaked fruitcake.  It also contains notes of ginger, lemongrass, and licorice.  The flavor is sweet, but no cloying and is very good overall.  It is complex, rich and fruity with traces of roots (ginger), various spices, candy sugar/syrup, caramel, and candied fruit.  This beer is strong and warming, but  there isnt any alcohol poking out.  At this point nearly all of the hoppiness and bitterness that might have been included has faded.  There is a hint of tobacco in the finish when the beer reaches warmer temperatures.  It also has  full body with a thick and syrupy texture that is sticky on the rim of the glass and on the lips.  Overall Bells Eccentric Ale is quite good and a very approachable.  It is very much like a barleywine ale with some added complexity from the spice/herb/vegetables that went into brewing this eccentric delicacy.  This is quite the sipping beer and quite enjoyable from the initial serving temperature of about 51°F all the way through the final sip taken at 77°F...

2004 and 1997 graciously provided by jtw. 

The 2004 still smelled very strong with barleywine raison alcohol but with some very nice chocolate in there as well.  Sweet chocolate and strong. Taste agina was a subdued version of that, very drinkable for its strength.  The biggest difference is the complete lack of spices in this, I got nothing. 9/4/7/3/16

The 1997 was EXTREMELY strong on the nose, much more than any other vintage.  Lots of oxidation but a whole lot of alcohol and lots of sherry/raison.  The flavor however has gone way downhill.  At 10 years, the flavors are starting to seep out, basically its starting to lose flavor.  Still lots of cardboard, paper, and very bitter alcohol left over.

Looks like a porter, dark brown with some burgundy red light seeping through the bottom of the glass.  Peppery ginger and mint nose, almost like a bad ginger cola or something.  I was not drawn to the smell at all, and the more I drank the less I liked it.  The spicy mint/ginger almost resembles horseradish and wasabi at times.  Has the body of an imperial stout, quite thick, low carbonation, but that doesnt make up for the mess of flavors that this beer has (I know thats the point, but it just doesnt taste good).  Has some smoked meat notes as well, with some cloying molasses on the back end.

Blind rating.  2004 bottle, batch 6714.  Thick, viscous body, dark brown cola colored body. Intense nose of cardamom bread and maple syrup scented bourbon.  Seedy tree bark and green cardamom, thick maple throughout, viscous, full, spicy and sage-like, some tingly pepperiness, weird, overdone chewiness.  Ginger, too. Not sure whats going on in this one.  I dont really like it, seems like juniper/gin.  Oxidized and stale, some cardboard, some old ale-like wateriness and staleness.

Tobacco and mint  in the flavor, herbal, sage, vegetal, green bean, squash, and a sweet oxidized- soy like sweet old malt flavor with caramel and toffee- brown sugar, pine sap and minty toothpaste in the end.  Crazy stuff.  I think I liked the 04 a bit better.   

2004 shared with Willblake.  Pours a slightly hazy dull brown with a nice light thin sticky head.  Aroma is phenolic and herbal with wierd muted and stale spices, lots of thick sweet crystal malts, mostly sweet and slightly oxidized.  Nice big flavor profile with lots of complex malts and moderate hop character left.  Some lemony hints along with wierd dried fruits like apricots and plums.  Nice sweet and smooth finish.

This beer reminds more of an older, bigger, mildly oxidized barleywine than I expected, but thats not at all what I figured to find.  But, darn it, its good.

75,"2007-01-18",4.1,"2004 bottle.  A huge thanks to Mike for hooking me up with this very rare treat.  This is something I have been wanting to get my hands on for quite some time.  Pours out a brown color with a tan head and a ton of sediment all in my glass.  I just recieved the box containing this beer today and I already opened it so the sediment is my fault.  Smell is sweet and citrusy with some caramel and some dark brown sugar smells.  Taste is sweet and heavy on the alcohol, infact, it is very much like drinking gas for the first few sips.  Once I became accustomed to the alcohol burn, it was a damn good beer.  A sipper in every since of the word.  I have drank half of the glass in an hour.  Pretty good stuff, hopefully Ill be able to score some again next time its released.  Thanks Mike.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

2008.12oz Bottle.  Batch#8877. In the past, Ive always very much looked forward to this beer, but somehow theres an aspect of this beer thats just a little bit scary. I think its either ""kitchen-sink"" aspect, or either the intense sugar thats guaranteed. This year is not an exception to either of these. What results is Sasparilla-like concotion, still flowing with ginger and lots of malty booze. Very spicy, in a floral sort of way. I feel like I get a palpable root-beer-like flavor, probably from the birch syrup, which is a fun ingredient. There are some oxidized hops on the backend and a whole flourish of fresh summer field flowers honey booze. Overall, this comes across as somehow more restrained, refined, and delicate than previous batches, but with the same signature spiciness that makes it what it is. Mmmm. What a wonderful cold winter night sipper. Thanks Sean!8/4/8/2/17=3.9

2007.12oz Bottle. Batch#K8309. Classic malty, ginger-hued, barleywine, yeast, alcohol aroma. Somehow less enticing this time around. A bit saccharin. Pours a dark, dark ruby-cornered brown, with a soapy white rim. Flavor is still solid, with some wild hippy store bulk section, buckwheat honey, and molasses. This is sweeter than I remember, somehow. Alcohol meshes well with sugars and spice character. This isnt faring well. Bubblegum and dust bring up the backend. Too much sickly yeast character and little desirable hop front. Chewy, spicy and licorice-like. Im a little disappointed that the ginger profile has been subdued and that the spice edge has been brought up. This really seems like beer-candy now, but retaining the classic profile this beer has in recent years always been uniquely known for.7/4/8/2/15=3.6","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
75,"2006-11-14",3.5,"2002 bottle.  Pours like thin old honey.  all carbonation has been visably lost, leaving only a viscous chestnut brown liquide stitting errily still in my glass.  Huge carmel, malt, and herbal hops in the nose along with something else but it drowned out by the big barlywine like nose.  Much is the same in the mouth.  Big thick mouthfeel, dates, prunes, ,brown sugar, a little alcohol, and raisons.  Finishes with honey, a lingering green bitterness, and a decent puff of alcohol.","Yokosuka, JAPAN","Marc"

Looks quite delicious I must say.  Aromas of caramel, molasses, a little pine there, and some spice.  Flavor is a good blend of caramel, clove, molasses, some cinnamon there too and brown sugar, ginger and nutmeg, and a little pine hop taste at the end.  Quite spicey on the finish especially.

Sticky and spicy all-around.. with caramel, molasses, and brilliant spices in the nose.  Spiced up and crazy in the flavor department, but I dug it... coriander, clove, and allspice on the front and middle, with molasses and light chocolate coming after... and warm alcoholley mulling spices at the finish.  The high levels of sweetness and spiciness did make it a bit harder to drink the full pour of, but I suppose it carried itself as well as could be expected considering the components.  Warm, boozy finish.  Very solid overall.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
75,"2006-07-18",4.0,"2004 bottling, sampled July 2006 (thanks a bunch Emily!): generous off tan foamextremely dark garnet.  Characteristic, yeasty Bells aroma  light alcohol, pine, oak and raw vegetables.  Light tingle on the tongue, a bit of grit just in front of a smooth creaminess.  Raw hop bitterness and lemon rinds.  Hints of vanilla, grass and bourbon.  Not quite as complex and spicy as the previous samplebut tasty no less!  [7/4/8/4/16  3.9]

2001 bottling at the Real Ale Fest (Chicago) 2003:  I think that it probably happened in the evening. . . green, red, yellow peppers, snow peas, water chestnuts, carrots, broccoli, celery, zucchini, red cabbage, and a couple of drops of Szechuan style spiced chili oil were all dropped into a large wok and stir fried with hops and barley.  The resulting bog of flavours was drizzled into bottles and capped up and sent off to the RAF.  The beer oozes out of the bottle and sits thickly in the glass.  A complex aroma of raisins, bacon, citrus rinds, and white wine hover over the glass.  An intense stir fry of flavours is masterfully balanced with hops, malt and every vegetable I have ever tried from anise to carrots they are all here and sing in harmony with each other.

Immense fruity flavors, a plethora of brown sugar, figs, dates, plums, a bushel of red apples Coriander, cardamom, clove, black peppercorn, bay leaf, Pine Sap, its exceptionally herbal, but more so directed over toward the molasses syrup side of the spectrum although there is NO carbonation I really value the sticky sweet palate very spicy and somehow dry in the finish the hops have fallen out and  left the spicyness... but not the bitterness... the oxidation plays nicely into the flavoring I must say However strange I Like It!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

Rich dark fruity malt dimensions that send waves of rummy fig and raisins to the nostrils.  Some gingerbread spice and maple syrup tones are also hiding in there.  A pinch of cinnimon and some caramelly bourbon with a hint of vanilla.  Complex aroma that I can still remember vividly while entering this rate the following day.  Full bodied, almost sticky mouthfeel, but with a shimmering carbonation that softens up the palate a bit.  The flavors are as rich and complex as the aroma.  Lots of caramel and vanilla begin on the palate with some dark fruity fig spice.  This is dried up by some light toasted oak notes that darken up the palate along with some prunes and a very mild clove spice.  Plenty of ginger as well.  I love the spicy tingle it leaves on the palate.  A pleasant hop bitterness rounds out the flavors, closing with a final smack of spruce resins.

75,"2006-01-26",5.0,"2000 vintage. This beer is a very eccentric, limited release beer, that is only brewed once a year, and can only be found on draught, and in a limited bottling run, at the Eccentric Cafe in Kalamazoo. A guest brewer is brought in every year to help Larry, and the recipe changes every year. The base beer is always a strong, old ale/barleywine, but over the years it has been spiced with a melange of fruits and spices, and always comes in at a warming 11% + abv.  The 2000 Vintage of Eccentric Ale, which was co-brewed by Terry Farendorf of the Steelhead Brewing Company of Eugene, OR. 

Bells Eccentric Ale 2000 pours to a murky caramel brown color with slight tan head that fades, and a soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is wonderful with layers of complex malty, spicy, and hoppy aromas. Sweet malt, citric hops, spicy aromas, and peppery alcohol flood the nose. The palate is lush and full on the tongue with complex layers of flavors. Sweet and caramel malt flavors marry with hints of butterscotch, ripe fruit, orange, black pepper, and flavors of spice such as ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, glide over the tongue. Eccentric Ale finishes with more complex malty, fruity, and spicy flavors up front, then ends with a warming, peppery alcohol burn. 

There is so much going on in this beer, it truly is eccentric, and is one to sip and savor. As stated this beer is brewed in one batch, and is available only in December for a short time at the brewery. 12oz bottles of this beer can be purchased for $5, and the bottle run of this beer is very limited. Every year this beer is released on Eccentric Day which is held in December.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Syrupy pour to a deep ruby brown color, translucent in light, with a circular, mossy tan head that trails out with galaxy wisps to the sides of the glass.  Aroma could start a fire.  Alcohol is apparent, and its a sinus elixir.  Hammering hops join maple syrup and amaretto to pump out the sweet aromatic vibes.  Other forceful wafts draw out freesia masking almonds, fruit salad and caramel apples.  Flavor is equally dominating.  Sweet, thick, syrupy hop train takes command.  Nectar nodes, apricot chews and double-indoctrinated maple syrup McGriddles buns continue the eccentric evolution.  Alcohol is discernable, but its so hoppy that its merely a footnote.  Nuances and character number in the hundreds.  Other flavor revelations bring out scores of brandy sautéed almonds, which are then pitched into a pool of caramel thats traditionally reserved for apple dipping.  Sticky, smacking and a raucous good time on the palate.  Balance favors hops, but its a melodious endeavor.  Finish is marked by a glow at the throat while figs and apricots get pulled from a honey pool thats now forever a part of them, and its currently submitting its application for acceptance as one of the seven servings of fruits a day.

This is a real good beer.","Zionsville, Indiana, USA","atpayne"
75,"2005-12-13",3.8,"(Bottle courtesy Sprinkle Indy tasting 12/10/05) - 2004 - Aroma is dryer sheet, hop, sweet malt, and black pepper.  Pours a muddy brown with little head and decent lacing.

An interesting and very different brew.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","MI2CA"

75,"2005-12-10",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2005 On tap (2005):  Aroma of caramel, toffee, banana bread, and huge citrus hops.  Muddy brown with a small off-white head that quickly fades to a ring around the glass.  Very quick sweetness up front of caramel, fruit, banana bread, and sugar.  The sweetness quickly gets dominated by a huge grapefruit hop finish that lingers for some time in the aftertaste.  Tasting it fresh the flavor profiles similar to a strongly hopped IIPA.

Bottle (2004):  Same flavors as above, but with the extra year they blend much better.  Hops arent nearly as strong and are more balanced with the malty flavors which play a much larger role in the 04.  Spice is there in the finish, but its so light that I cant pinpoint what it is.  2004 is more like a barley wine.

75,"2005-08-14",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 11, 2008 Poured by Larry Bell at the Great Taste of the Midwest, Madison, 2005. 1996 vintage. My wife and I were among the last to sample this one from the 9 year old bottle, and as a result, our sample was fairly loaded with sediment and yeast. I must say, Eccentric is the proper descriptive. Notes of clove, cinnamon, allspice, juniper, apple, sour cherry come out on the nose and on the palate. I get more darker flavors on the palate as well: molasses and carmalized sugar. The bottle was likely past its prime, unfortunately. RERATE: Larry poured a 2004 version at the 2008 Great Taste. I liked this considerably better, and it seems to age rather impressively. True it’s a bit too spiced for my liking (I’m never been a big fan of Christmas ales -- essentially anything I can taste nutmeg, clove, and ginger), but this was solid.

The aroma is jam packed full of hops, cider, oak, brown sugar, cinnamon, orange peel, chocolate and clove.  Flavor is like a thick appley grain combo, with more of the brown sugar, caramel, and oak coming back for an attack..  Very little to no alcohol presense.

Hefty lush aroma with tons of chewy soft caramel, spicy claro tobacco leaves, scorched orange and pineapple, big blackened piney hops, and evocatively rich, big alcohol noting to that of a spiked milkshake.

Heavenly.

This is dreamy. Thick, lush, warm, and palate soaking caramel malt lightly laced with chocolate alcoholic warmth. Then slipping off to a trailing sweeter tropical fruity center of shish kabobed pineapple, orange, and dates wrapped in a dark and rugged piney hop bitterness. The onslaught continues. Earthen tobacco. More chocolate laced heat, more caramel, more really dark hops. Again, more chocolate. Its a three course meal of flavor and length. 

Heavenly.

Super lush feel; thick, full, warming, returns and returns of layered chocolate, heat, caramel, and touches of earth. Finish gains a cosmicly ragged but bitterly acceptable full hop cone of dripping pine sap. Coats the back of the throat late with creamy leftover caramel, fruits, chocolate, and tobacco.

Heavenly.

If you like Third Coast Old Ale as much as I do, youll like this just as much if not more. Comes across as a barleywine in my book.

The aroma is an explosion of caramel and toffee with apple cider highlights.  This is an exercise in flavor.  Candied apples, caramel, toffee and buttery flavors are enhanced by an almost minty spiciness, finishing with piney hops bitterness.  The big, sticky, relatively flat body is at least as thick as 2002 Expedition Stout.  It is as if somebody melted gooey, buttery, spicy cookies in a liquid matrix.  Delicious gooey, buttery, spicy cookies, that is.  Alcohol is warming but subdued by the syrupy body.  Thanks Mike (BBB63) for this rare gem!  I have now entered the zone of beer debt.
1993 vintage sampled at Bells 20th Anniversary Party.

Minty, spicy aroma with hints of rosemary.  Densely caramely body with brown sugar, prune, grape, rosemary, mint, and definitely ginger.  A fellow sampler suggested it was teriyaki sauce, which was a fitting description.  Not as Christmas-cookieish as the more recent vintage I tried, but still tasty and quite rich.Rating for 1993 vintage Eccentric Ale: APP: 5 ARO: 8 FLAV: 8 PAL: 5 OV: 17 (4.3 overall).2005 vintage, released December 2006.This years release had a deep fiery red-brown body, topped by a thin, dissipating light buff head.  The aroma was primarily of cinnamon and ginger, met by sharp notes of hot alcohol.  The body is dominated by sweet malts, almost soda-like in their sugary immediacy, paired with the spices mentioned above.  Alcohol detectable but not overtly so.  Not as complex or interesting as the other vintages Ive tried, this even comes across as a bit thin due to the lack of depth exhibited by the exaggerated sweet malts. Rating: 7-4-7-4-14 (3.6).","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
75,"2004-01-18",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2008 Murky orange brown, the faintest trace of bubbles finally breaks the surface. Just not a pretty beer.  Aroma initially of grapefruit baked with brown sugar on top, but just before it hit my lips, a strong waft of powerful malts rose up.  The flavor is thick with molasses, toffee, and caramel, with a strong, drying hop character to balance that introduces flavors of grapefruit and a good sized pine forest.  Any spices used suffuse nicely into the beer character, and serve to enhance, not overwhelm.  Wonderful stuff, would age magnificently.  Tried a 2006 at the 2008 VRBT.  Deep brown, rich malts, caramel, treacle, almost sour tannic fruits, then a bitter hop finish.  Like a good but very unusual barleywine.  Identical score.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
75,"2004-01-09",3.8,"Looked a lot like apple juice. Extremely spicy nose was bursting with wafty aromas. Very sweet malts (brown sugar, molasses), but not quite over my threshold. Spices were heavy and knife-like and very aromatic. Alcohol fumes wafted as well, adding another dimension to the edginess of this beer. Notes of fruit and spiced apples. Hops fraternized with the spices, making it difficult to distinguish ... but I could pick out some pine, quite possibly a little grapefruit, and a little bitterness. Dryish finish. Overall, I didn't know what to think at first, but I seemed to enjoy it more and more with every sip. And looking back, I wish I had more. Thanks, John!","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
75,"2004-01-08",4.2,"Pours a murky mahogany color with a ring of bubbles around the top of the glass.  Nutty aroma of red wine, some hops, malt and alcohol.  Very barleywinish.

Thanks BBB63 for the rare Bell's hookup in PA!","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
75,"2004-01-07",4.2,"2003: Moderately hazed orangish rust. Headless. Microscopic, lethargic bubbles fight their way to the surface. Tangy, succulent malt aroma with tobacco, sap, and pepper notes. Hints of pine, sage, peppermint, wood, and brass. Thick and vicious as can be on the palate with miniscule carbonation. Billowing spiciness is greeted by chewy, leathery malts and a surging, unifying juiciness. Pine needles prick the palate along with a touch of mustiness and sage. Leathery malt finish with pine cones, solvent, fairly spicy bitterness, and perfectly fruity. Long sprucy, herbal afterthoughts. Intriguingly superb.
2002: The aging has produced more mellow malt and sherry notes. Spices are still at the forefront with tobacco, woody malts, pistachio, and gooey caramel. Subtle phenols, toasted graham, mulch, and some melon and peach esters. Much more integrated  with a year under its belt. Round and thick. Full-bodied is an understatement. Intense spiciness tingles the roof of the mouth. Hints of wax and coarse rubbery alcohol. Finishes with spicy alcohol and bushels of savory malts. As expected, a bit mellower than the 03, yet it still has plenty of life as there is no sign of oxidation, the malts have developed more ripeness, and the spices are still loud and clear. Need I say superlative?","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
75,"2004-01-06",2.8,"No head at all.  Cloudy/dirty brown color.  Thick spice aroma.  Very full in mouth and syrupy.  Thoughts of cough syrup and V8 came up.

Very murky brown body with no head.
Fruit, marmalade-like, cooked vegetable and a deep, malty backbone for the aromas. Some port notes in the aroma too.
Great malt backbone. Raisin/plum flavors dominate. Sweet hop-bite that counters the alcohol well. Spicy with a pronounced alcohol flavor.

I really like this one.  Dark brew with a thin head.  A bitter taste along with a complex and spicy aroma make your senses confused while drinking.

75,"2003-12-13",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 13, 2006 2003 draught. Well this weekend certainly made me rethink my ratings.  A bells beer to beat batch 6000?? Come on.  But it did.  Put it to shame.  This was awesome.  Pure dark brown, with some deep orange tones.  Lacing, and a small head that lingered.  Smells of vinegar, rich malt, alcohol, raspberries?? definitely some piney hops and some oak.  Begins with a big bittersweet malt flavor with the malt and hops being wedded together well.  Huge amount of hops comes through in the middle, gets quite grapefruity.  The finish was my favorite.  Got extremely complex.  Red fruits, caramel malt, alcohol soaked in oak, maple, brown sugar, cinnamon and finally a little dose of carbonation.  Very full bodied.  Its all there.  This one raises the ante on batch 6000.  2003 bottle aged 6 months.  Wow, this is definitely as good as I remember.  Huge extra full body still.  Beer has not calmed down much, huge hops bitterness, stingingly large malt flavor.  Needs a long nap still.  Oh and the aroma is wonderfully complex with notes of maple, dark fruits, cinnamon, chocolate, alcohol and hops resin,  but not quite as full as I would like.2003 bottle aged almost 18 months The vegetables or mint or whatever the leafy, green, herbal-like stuff they brew this with is really starting to show.  Still an awesome pour, slight oxidation beginning to show.  I think it could be cumin seeds.  About 1,000 different things going on in this beer.  Full body, very low carbonation, but not syrupy or unbalanced.1997 bottle consumed 3/19/05  The spice really drives this beer now, with the body being quite oxidized and some thinning as a result.  Still, the wonderful malting on this can be felt, even at this age.  With much of the sediment out of solution, you can really see the dark raspberry/brown color to the body.  Small, beige fizzy head.  No alcohol apparency, some sugariness on the finish and plenty of complexity still exists.  I find eccentric ale to be one of the most difficult beers to describe.  Score reflects sort of a culmination/combination of how I feel about this beer as a whole, taking in to account the different experiences I have had with it.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
75,"2003-12-12",3.9,"2003 on Eccentric Day: Very muddy ""bottom of the Paw Paw River"" brown with small off-white head and some lace. The aroma is huge and complex with hints of sweet spice, cashews, pine, grapefruit, earthy yeast, wood, and alcohol, which combined with the spice almost burns the nose. The taste had all the characteristics detected on the nose. The pine, spice, and tart fruit stand out with a surprising smoky finish. The alcohol is very forward in this brew. While the ABV wasn't listed, I'm guessing it at least the 11% listed here, if not more. Very warming on the cold day. The full-bodied brew is slightly sticky and chewy, lush mouthfeel. This is a big in your face beer, not for the faint of heart. It's like the Third Coast Old Ale on steroids, now you know. This will age very well, perhaps up to 5-7 years.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Consumed today in honor of this year's Eccentric day.  Hoppy barleywineish aroma (reminiscent of 3COA) but with sage as well.  (Just like my homebrewed sage barleywine)  Low carbonation.  Definite alcohol, with a spicy (undiscernable besides sage) malt backbone.  Some sweet caramel as well.  Hats off to the Eccentric ones at Bell's!","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
75,"2003-12-12",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2004 #300 for me. Yes! I am first to rate the newest installment of the Eccentric Ale. I had it today on tap at the brewery, everyone was dressed up as usual. The beer looked quite like apple cider. It was served in small 12 ounce snifters and they wouldn't serve it in anything larger because of the alcohol content. The smell wasn't the greatest and I cannot place it. The taste however was a smorgasbord of flavors. Bitter hops, smokey and sweet, caramel, toffee,. The beer was quite thick and oily. Very complex. Nice to have the chance to taste it. Quite nice. I actually held off on drinking beer this week so that the Eccentric would be my 300th. Cheers.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","thehoff"

Very vinous nose, rich & complex; woody, blue grapes, slightly coriander, also parsley. Luscious fruit, bitterish taste, spicey and bitter chocolate. Everything which can be good in a beer. Very hoppy-bitterish palate covering malty richness. Fruity as dark plums, preserved oranges, etc. Warming up, the coriander gives some soupy connotations. Viscosity also in the mouthfeel, very thick & syrupy. Long bitterish, spicey aftertaste (black chocolate with nutmeg and coriander). No barley wine could do better than this. love it.

Crazy-big, mucho impressivo. Update: 2003 was more sprucy than the cask verstion I had at the '02 RAF. Or maybe it was my palate at the time. A jumble of various unidentifiable herbs. The aged '02 was much deeper and richer in palate and body. The carbonation stayed on the bottom of the glass and resembled fish eggs.

After being patient, aroma seemed malty but perhaps a bit fruiter than 3CoA. Flavor is simply packed--caramel, raisins, berries, spice. Alcoholic flavor, evident in the aroma as well. Hoppier than 3C0A but not as smooth, alcohol overwhelms flavor more quickly, which was somewhat of a shame, but overall this is an incredibly impressive beer, the jewel of the '03 RAF for me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"

As you can see from the rating below, the 2003 batch of Eccentric really improved over my previous tasting.  A complete departure from the 2001.  TheHoff hits the appearance best by likening it to apple cider ... real British apple cider (think Old Scrumpys) not the candy sold in the U.S.  The sweetness would be over the top if not for the truckloads of citrusy hops.  Devestatingly well put together, warming, and warm greeting to the holiday season, this is one damn nice brew.

The bottle I tried was from the 2001 release of Eccentric.  Bell's changes the recipe every year, so I wouldn't expect to see a whole lot of uniformity of reviews.  This batch contained virtually no carbonation.  Definitely oily thick and a multitude of flavors combatting for attention throughout the first sip; some of the winners include: licorice and soy (I know it sounds strange, but I could taste soy!)  There are really few words to describe this beer and it invents a style of its own.  This is a beer to drink outside during a snow storm ... not quite sure why, but that's where it would taste best.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"

No carbonation, pours like swamp water, tastes warm even when cold.  The alcohol whacked me upside the head and warmed me immediately (and Ive been drinking lots of high abv beers recently).  Let me take a stab: ginger, honey, coriander,  and banana.  Lots of hops and malt.  By the end of the glass I was a convert, but you have to give it some time.
