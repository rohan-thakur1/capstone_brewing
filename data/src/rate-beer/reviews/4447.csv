Je me permets de faire ce review dune bière qui mapparaît clairement past-prime car je souhaite ardemment déguster à nouveau cette bière et ainsi apprécier ce quelle a à offrir à tous les stades de son évolution. Liquide rosé et presque ambré qui offre une tête abondante et persistante. Un myriade de fines bulles émanent du fond de la bouteilles. Tant de légèreté me fait saliver! Arômes caractérisées par un sucre résiduel important qui frôle le glaçage à gâteau. Je sens de lananas, Marc-André ressent de la fraise. Oui, certainement un peu des deux. Un petit gâteau du style muffin ou shortcake qui révèle également une poudre damande pâtissière. Il ne faut pas croire que ce liquide nest que sucre car un fond très funky et lambic-esque ne peut être tenu sous silence. Vraiment, la culture bactérienne responsable de cette fermentation mest présente et très agréable mais bon, le temps a eu raison delle. Le même scénario se produit en bouche. La fine bulle me plaît beaucoup mais la cerise nest pour moi quune simple mention sur une étiquette. Lourde, chargée et sucrée, je refuse de croire que cette bière devait ressembler à cela.

Musty, funky aroma with strong acetic acid and sour acidity along with oak tannins, lactic funk, juicy sour cherries and subtle toasted oak. Some vanilla bean and red wine character as well along with heavy barnyard funk and horseblanket. The fruit presence stands out as it warms giving off hints of cherry juice, fleshy skins and earthy pits. 

Full body with very dry and acidic sourness countered by sweet, fleshy cherry, lactic funk, musty bugs and barrel. Dry toasted oak along with vinous red wine notes, notably dark grape, sour cherry, current, strawberry and other dark fruits. This is countered by acetic sourness, lactic funk, musty bugs and dry oak. Decent amount of lingering acetic vinegar in the bone dry finish that leaves me drooling for more.

Flavor mostly follows but the cherries dont really burst on the palate and this beer lacks the really uniquely Lambic-y quality that just blasts you in the base Grrrz. Still better than almost every American cherry sour.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
4447,"2014-11-04",4.0,"Bottle #230, generously shared by Collin. Clear garnet pour with a fleeting white head. Nice sour cherry and funk aromas. Tart with sour cherry highlights. Mild barnyard and funk notes with barrel undercurrents. Good body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"

4447,"2014-10-13",4.3,"Bottle. Bright red pour with very nice pink head. Aroma is loaded with cherries and other berries, some leaves and cherry pie spices. Taste is bright cherries, some leaves. Acidity is very intense and well done, citric and lactic. An acidity this high is pretty uncommon for an American sour which isnt acetic. Maybe a little too sour for my liking, but very well done.","Quebec, CANADA","Luk_"

Pours pink/purple with low pink head. Intense lacing. Aroma is of cherries, berries, sourness. Taste is of cherries, sourness, acidity, some ""tannins"", cheese. Palate: Mouth-puckering. Light-medium body, low-medium carbonation. Overall: Very good. Im pretty sure I would have think belgian in a blind tasting. This one aint fooling around.

4447,"2014-09-22",3.9,"Bottle shared by tom10101, thanks a lot Tom! Pours a dark red with a pinkish head that leaves some lacing. Nose is of cherries of course but also offers some candy and funk. Taste is really acidic but not acetic (this doesnt feel like an american sour at all in that aspect). Flavors are just fruity and loaded with cherries. Body is light, carbonation moderate and like I said acidity level is pretty high but it remains drinkable. Overall a nice one, not sure why my score is so low compared to my tasting colleagues but Ill stand by that for now.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
4447,"2014-09-21",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2014 Bottle (750 ml). From Frank, thanks! Beautiful appearance, almost clear bright reddish pink with a small pinkish head and little lacing. Aroma is of light barnyard, bright cherries, hay, funk, leafy notes, light sulfur (but not in a bad way)... all superbly integrated. Taste is also wonderful and really ""Belgian"" with a kind of funk very similar to Drie Fonteinen as well as bright cherries (but they dont take all the place), hay, leafy notes, hints of sweetness and light hints of sulfur. Medium body. Moderate/medium carbonation. Superb Kriek and without a double the best american fruited sour Ive ever had. True to style. Can compete against any Belgian Kriek. The balance is simply amazing. Incredibly tasty. My favorite Kriek ever along De Cam Oude Kriek.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
4447,"2014-09-21",4.5,"Bottle shared at tasting. Beautiful bright pink red pour with lacy, creamy pink foam. Aroma is fantastic, intense fleshy cherry pulp and skins, winey notes, black and sour cherries, citrusy and lactic aromas. Taste is tart, nice sharp tartness with explosive sweet cherry flavor. This is really, really nice beer, it combines several of the best elements of classic Belgian gueuze, leafy, minty oude gueuze notes with an bright and fresh american twist. It is the most authentic kriek Ive tasted from the USA, and just simply a sublime beer.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

4447,"2013-11-06",4.2,"Served on-tap at the Bainbridge Street Barrel House 1st Anniversary Party as well as from a bottle a few months back.


A - Pours ruby red with a fluffy one and a half finger tall pink head, dissipating down to a light film around the edges of the glass, leaving spotty trails of lace down the sides of the glass. Really nice looking beer.


S - Smells of tart sour cherries, damp basement must, bit of barnyard funk, woody oak, earthy minerals and some nice sourness. You can really pick out the individual parts making this one up.


T - Starts off just like the nose. Lots of tart sour cherries up front quickly giving way to the musty funk blend from the yeast and a quick hit of tart sourness. Hints of oak, some citric fruit and the earthy minerals help round it all out. Finish is tart with a decent amount of dryness, lingering after each sip.


M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Tart, dry feel with a good amount of fruit throughout.


O - An excellent Kriek. You can really taste the Cantillon must and Drie Fonteinen funk from the yeast and they combine really well with the cherries. Last time I had it the cherries were losing out to the stronger yeast, I am glad to see some extra time has evened things out. Cant wait to get my hands on some bottles of this one, its going to age with the best of them.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

4447,"2013-08-03",4.2,"Thanks for bringing this one Mike

unlabeled pre release bottle shared at our 7/27/13 tasting

Once poured, this was one of the best looking beers i have seen. I will second Josh in that it reminded me of being a kid drinking fruit punch, only it packed more punch.. da da da

No head or lacing to be found. Smell of under ripe cherry skin. The smell was underwhelming, and didnt do the appearance or taste any justice.

Flavor of ripe sweet cherries with a mild acidity. Bright citrus with a bit of lemony funk. Extremely well balanced flavor of fruit and sourness. I want a bottle to age for a few yrs to see how the funk developes.

Overall, really happy to have tried this pre bottle release. Probably the youngest kriek I have had to date and it exceeded my expectations of what an american brewery making belgian lambic/krieks can do","NYC, New York, USA","Godofthecellar"
4447,"2013-06-28",4.3,"Bottle with Bill/Frank, shared by Frank via Nate. Thanks brahs. Keg conditioned. Pours hazy cranberry with light head, small amt of lacing. Aromas are musk, barn, cherry, perfume, taste is lambic kriek, sour cherry, raspberry, oak, and tart funkiness. The flavor is much more impressive then aroma but it is still relatively young and not bottle conditioned, those should be retarded in a month or two. All things considered, this is excellent.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
