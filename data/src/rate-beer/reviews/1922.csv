1922,"2017-02-13",2.9,"On tap at Societe, pours a clear amber orange with a small beige head. Aroma brings out English resinous hops, toasted caramel and bready malt. Flavour is pretty laid back on the hops, with subdued English hops, bready malt and a hint of caramel. Not totally convinced by this one. I guess an English-style IPA can only be so good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

1922,"2014-08-20",2.9,"Societe specifically calls this an English IPA (not a pale) and therein lies the problem. Im already not as big a fan of the english hoppy brews, and on top of that this is a rather pedeestrian 5.2% abv, and not vibrantly hopped. As a pale, its ok. As an ipa, English or otherwise...meh","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
