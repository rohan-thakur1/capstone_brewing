3398,"2017-05-22",3.8,"Cette bière sadresse aux sincères amateurs de framboises. En suis-je un? Je lignore. Chose certaine est que je suis heureux davoir partagé cette petite bouteille de 375ml. Robe rouge pourpre, non filtrée, et profonde. Arômes de confiture de framboises, de pépins de framboises, de plant de framboises et de pulpe. Il y a tant de fruit dans cette bière que le funk en est réduit presque à néant. Même scénario en bouche. Je peine à percevoir autre chose que ce fruit dominant qui semble avoir été réduit en purée directement dans mon verre. Heureusement, le liquide est peu sucré, voire sec. Un fond presque aigre dans loesophage mais encore là, je suspecte lacidité du fruit plus que lacidité de bactéries lactiques.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
3398,"2017-05-15",4.3,"A 375ml bottle, bottled in December 2015. Poured into a Cantillon ballon glass. It was a dark burgundy ruby red colour with a just over one finger off pink with a dark orange hued head that dissipated fairly quickly to a thin cap with some nice lacing. There was some very nice sweet and tart raspberry jammy aromas with perhaps a hint of oak. Tastes sour and tart raspberries and lemon to begin, followed by some light sweet jammy raspberries and a hint of oak. It finishes sour again with lemon, some citric acidity and a touch of grapes. Medium bodied with moderate to light carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall the aromas were stunning and while the taste didnt quite match up to the aroma, it was still very good.","Hong Kong, HONG KONG","davidezdonz"

3398,"2016-09-27",4.7,"My Bottom Line:
Deep raspberry juices grace lactic acidity, leathery undertones and wooden depths in this perfectly cohesive and highly seductive Barrel-Aged Fruit Beer.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A pink sheet of foam tops the glistening blood red.
-Raspberry and lactic acidity quickly become one in the flavour profile.
-Flavor intensity is, as usual for Crooked Stave, high enough to create interest with every sip and smooth enough to encourage drinkability and more delicate food pairings.
-Body is softly effervescent and velvety.
-All components are perfectly balanced. This is an impressive blend.

Some touches of red wine and funk, cherries and fleshy raspberry start to raise in depth and potency. Dark fruit, lactic jabs and a touch of yogurt and acidity. Backend is fleshy, berry driven with a distinct carmelized and toasty base, biscuit and vanilla come on a bit more, that darker base gives some life. A bit deeper and complex compared to a straight sour. Some carmelized, balsamic, red wine and oak. Toast, faint cocoa, firmer vanilla with decent oak. Jabs of raspberry skin and pulp meet well with that vanilla, toast and carmelized biscuity feel. A bit darker, deep and lactic as we taper out. This one has some life.
