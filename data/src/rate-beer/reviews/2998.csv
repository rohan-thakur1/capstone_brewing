2998,"2014-10-29",2.5,"330 ml bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy bright orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, pear, apple, honey, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Mediocre aromas with notes of big fruity/earthy yeast and moderate pale malt sweetness; with poor balance. Way too much fruitiness in the nose. Taste of lemon, orange peel, pear, apple, honey, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange peel, pear, apple, honey, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very mediocre flavor profile with poor balance of pale malt sweetness and some significant fruity yeast ester flavors; with some moderate cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is a bit rough. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a really poor strong lager style. Just all around unbalanced and overly fruity in flavor; and pretty difficult to drink with the odd/rough mouthfeel.

2998,"2012-10-13",2.9,"11.2oz Bottle. The pour was a clear golden yellow with an average (1-2 finger) white fizzy head that was mostly diminishing with poor spotty lacing.

The aroma was lightly sweet with a light grain malt, floral and grassy hops and a sweaty yeast and had notes of caramel, honey, a slight fruity ester (apple I believe) and a mild medicinal scent.

The taste was lightly sweet and very malty with light hints of caramel and honey from the start, and then had a mild taste of hops slowly work in to the mix with the finish having a mild fruity alcohol presence towards the end. The flavor hung on for an average time proceeding the swallow, with a slight alcohol sweetness and a more pronounced hoppy grain flavor that was left to linger on the taste buds.

Mouthfeel was a bit beyond light in body with a light syrupy texture and a medium carbonation.

Wouldnt be surprised if Imperial Lager/Pilsner and Strong Beer are really the same, just with varying ABVs and names depending on marketing strategy.  Anyways, its not terribly clean in the nose but what is surprising is how well hidden the alcohol is and how nicely balanced and textured it is in the mouth (for a beer of this type).  If only the acetaldehyde and DMS and huskiness werent in the aroma, this could be quite nice.

Aroma - Strange. Apple vinegar. Yeast. Spices. Alcohol.

Sugary and a bit bilious. With some air in the glass, theres some tartness that could be likened to a tripel, but its one golden thread in a pile of used dental floss.

2998,"2009-08-04",1.9,"Brewed in Sri Lanka, the Lion Imperial Lager boasts a proud lion on its bottle cap and bottle label, his golden eyes gleaming at me as his equally bright gold contents fill my lager glass. Im not quite sure how natural a golden yellow that is, though a tall and proud head of fluffy white foam makes for the perfect mane. Raising my glass, I am immediately overtaken by sweet golden corn, fresh off the cob, cooked and sweetened. A bare whisper of dry straw and hay flits through the background, but quickly yields to the glass of corn sitting before me. Let me say right now that an overly corny beer is never a good thing. My first quaff is thick as his flavor aims right for the top of my tongue where I find a new crop of sweet summer corn growing most magnificently. Too thick and too sweet, he cloys and clogs, making for a hard swallow. Sweet corn which I enjoy fresh off the cob to eat is one thing; this is another issue entirely. Cooked and artificially sweetened, a growing backdrop of dank, soggy hay grows with each subsequent quaff. I have had about all I can stomach, and it is with somber clarity that I share the rest of my glass contents with the kitchen sink.


Horrible. I tried it, but I just didnt like it, and Im not the only one I fear. Sure, he has a higher alcohol because of the imperializing but a beers ABV is second to none when it comes to what matters first: taste. Hopefully I will never come across another Lion Imperial Lager, but if I do, I am going to calmly and slowly take a step back, turn around without making eye contact, and head in the opposite direction to safety, and to good beer.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

2998,"2008-11-28",3.1,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a straw color with a thin white head.  Some cloudiness, but looks more like a dirty cloudy, than a tasty cloudy.  Aroma is light and grainy.  Flavor is sweet grain and malt, with hints of raisin and dried fruit.  Not much alcohol flavor for an 8% brew.  Palate is medium bodied, kind of dead.  Overall a drinkable beer, but not one of my favorites.","Littleton, Colorado, USA","FlyingSwine"
2998,"2008-11-15",2.5,"Bottle from College Liquors in Grand Junction, CO. Pours a crystal clear golden color with a small white bubbly head. The aroma is mostly skunky corn and grains. The flavor is pretty much full of sweet corn and other adjuncts, a sour mash, and skunked flavor. I’m not sure how fresh this was, but it was just a OK lager.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
2998,"2008-10-23",3.3,"12oz bottle-pours a frothy to rocky and retaining white head and yellow/gold color.  Aroma is sweet grain-caramel, grassy, some spicy hops.

2998,"2008-10-12",2.2,"Poured a clear yellow/orange with a large white head.  Aroma of apple juice and rice.  Taste is pretty sweet with some hops.  The finish isn’t too great, and you can tell there is more alcohol.","Maryland, USA","scottw86"
2998,"2008-10-02",3.4,"12oz bottle marked as 8.8% ABV: Clear gold pour with a smallish head that dissipates.  The aroma is malt forward with heavy notes of fresh dough, wet hay, wildflower honey.  The body follows the same flow, lots of sweet malts.  The ethery alcohol whispers in the background, hinting at this being a heavy hitter.  Interesting style that is done well here.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"
2998,"2008-09-05",4.3,"This is a tasty, nicely balanced strong lager that is very smooth and easy to drink while maintaining good flavour and body throughout.  Dark gold, it has a big, off-white head that slowly shrinks and leaves a little lace. The aroma has bread, grapes, raisins, fruit , vanilla and riesling. It’s sweet and fruity (esp. grapes), with fresh sweet bread/bakery character and with a spicey, zesty quality. A pleasant, mild hop character balances the malt.","California, USA","Wulfstan"
2998,"2008-07-30",2.6,"Pours gold with a thin white head.  Smells of corn, some straw, alcohol.  Tastes of dry malt and some hoppy hints with a boozy finish.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"

2998,"2008-06-30",1.0,"The very mild, sweet, grainy lager aroma is extremely overpowered by the offensive smell of cheap, corn sugar alcohol. Pours a pale yellow/gold with no head to speak of. Tastes almost exactly like Steel Reserve, a very cheap and foul malt liquor styled lager. Heavy alcohol flavor and bite that masks an overly sweet, underhopped, undermalted beverage of little distinction. Overall, I was extremely disappointed that this came from the same brewery that makes the sublime, almost faultless Lion Stout. You are warned.","Crestwood, Kentucky, USA","posty"
2998,"2008-06-13",2.2,"Not much aroma. Well, this doesznt hide the alcohol at all!! Strong from the star, it gets a little bit better in the end.  Seems a bit like a malt liqour.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
2998,"2008-05-27",2.3,"Bottle.  Thought that the very idea of an ""imperial lager"" sounded interesting, but pour looks pretty blah... light and clear gold color with a slight head that is fizzy and ephimeral.  Aromas are apple juice and spice.  Flavor is very sweet... almost like a sparkling apple juice or something with a little bit of a spicy side to it and a corn/adjunct flavor.  Really not as exciting as I had hoped.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

2998,"2008-04-03",2.9,"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a frankly pee-colored yellow with an inch of white head. The suds reduces to a blotchy cap leaving some unexpectedly substantial lacing.

Nose is citrusy with a faint metallicness. Also some grainy sweetness.

Flavor is grainy caramel maltiness with a buttery note at the end. Some tart citrus and an almost candy-like sweetness round things out. 

Mouthfeel is pleasantly dry for the amount of sweetness, but its also overcarbonated. The medium-light mouthfeel cant really contend with the alcohol level either.

Drinkability is hampered by the high alcohol and the eventually cloying sweetness.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
2998,"2008-02-26",2.8,"Sweet aroma of malt and grain with some candy notes.  Taste is similar but even sweeter with some bitter herbs and definately some alcohol showing through.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","gabbama"
2998,"2008-02-11",2.9,"Pours bright golden with a fully receding off-white head. Aroma of sweet grain, some ethanol and fusels, cookie dough, candied malt, herbal hop bitterness. Taste is sticky, malty, sweet candied malt with some herbal bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation. I’m generally not a big fan of golden lagers brewed to a high ABV,but this wasn’t bad. More drinkable than the typical Euro Strong Lager.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","TheBeerOrg"
2998,"2008-01-04",2.0,"Bottle shared by EDA. A strong, skunky lager, massively corny and sickly sweet.

2998,"2007-11-01",1.7,"Ugh...this is awful! The one thing I will admit..this does NOT taste like an 8%er. Aroma was weak. Could pick up light malt but barely. Pour was a light gold with no head or bubbles. Taste was very sweet and thick. Could pick up malt but very heavy in the sugar. This tastes like malt liquor to me. Wow...as I get to the middle this may be a drainpour.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
2998,"2007-10-24",2.7,"The color was light golden/orange.  The head was creamy, thin, and off-white.  The aroma was tart, acidic, and lacking.  The flavor was light alcohol, corn, and bran.

Aroma-Mild malt and hops scent.  More corn and alcohol than anything else.  Not much to speak of.
Appearance-Standard lager clear golden color with a quickly disappating head.
Flavor-Why reproduce mass production style lager with a higher alcohol content?  idk but if this is what you are after than more power to you.
Palate-Bitter alcohol with metallic tones.
Overall-If you want to get drunk quick and you like the taste of the mass produced lagers this is the beer for you.  It is not the beer for me however.","North Carolina, USA","BeerCommonSewr"
2998,"2007-08-03",1.7,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2008 Off spoiled aroma in bottle but, in the glass it has a little sweetness added to the olfactory. Smell comes on with slight hints of strong ale. Ubiquitous pale yellow american lager appearance. Has the feel of pale lager with some above average whisky added. I frowned upon lion stout so I was not looking forward to trying this because the label looks just like lion stout. For 8%, you certainly can taste the alky but it is not very abrasive, not quite in the face. Has a recently manufactured plastic hose taste that comes and goes. I know this is in the pale lager style, but it is certainly a malt liquor. Cheap american malt liquor finish.  You know, the same as a strong ale but cheaper. Better than Lion Foreign  Stout.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

Looking at the glass it is sparkling and very thin looking like a pale lager should look.  There is a slight grassy and citrusy aroma with a little alcohol aroma.  Takeing a taste there is a slight citrusy taste along with a hint of banana taste.  The body is light with a watery texture and lively carbonation.  In the finish:  There is a metallic finish along with a alcoholic finish.","Hamilton, Michigan, USA","biggenius29"

2998,"2007-06-06",2.7,"The aroma was fruity with a grape note when first poured into the glass. A strong grape juice (like white grape juice) character dominated the aroma with wafts of strong alcohol. Some caramel lurked behind and a light bready character. In the glass the beer was crystal clear golden but lost all head in an instant and barely even traced at the glass. The flavor was malty and strong with alcohol. There could be no doubt that this beast is here and is going for your throat with the entire pride backing him up. Caramel and a lightly spicy hop nature was notable, but alcohol ruled the day. The body was medium full and with a low level of carbonation the beer was not creamy on the palate. The alcohol was notable in the aroma and flavor but was surprisingly restrained in the warming that came after consumption. Not my first choice for an Imperial Pils. 330 ml bottle.","North of Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","NicerInPerson"
2998,"2007-05-21",2.0,"So this imperial ""thing"" has carried over to Sri Lanka. Bring it on! Light golden color with a full off-white head. Dust malt and corn aromas. Hints of alcohol mix with the corn. The longer this one warms the worse it smells. Light floral sweetness couples with pale malt and light corn syrup. A somewhat sharp middle with a lightly acidic/acetic bite that carries to the finish and linger. Full bodied and sort of silky. Finish is simple and just has a grain induced light alcohol sweetness. A malt liquor by any other name...","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
