3549,"2016-06-08",3.9,"650 ml bottle from Charles Liquor store in Boston. Aroma: really oaky proudly represented by vanilla, also citrusy mostly lemon, floral and bubble gum. Quite different from your usual gose. App: hazy pale / straw, small white head, good retention but little lacing. Taste and palate: light body, soft carbonation, citrusy, oaky salty slightly bitter finish. Overall: well this is really interesting. Really different from what I had expected. The oak really takes a big place in this beer and also denatured it a bit but the finish is still salty and acidified which I enjoyed and is right on style. This is not something for someone wanting a true-by-the-style gose. I must conquer that this does not seem as refreshing as a true gose at first but the finish really is. And at the end it really makes it. Again... Really like it.","St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Stoned99"

3549,"2016-04-07",4.2,"Bottle, shared by me... in the library... just now.
Pours a hazy pale yellow with a big fluffy white head and nice lacing on the glass.

The aroma is really stinky in a fun way, a little funky & a little piney with some almost like moldy bread stuff happening along with a little pop of citrusy brightness. 

The flavor is similarly jarring in a similarly pleasant way. Gracious its so fruity at first with a little bit of like maybe like sarsaparilla root that it comes off as sweet, but as it progresses you realize the beer is really quite dry. The way the tartness plays off the spruce flavors is really cool, not to mention the very nice level of bitterness at play here. The saltiness is low but noticeable and lingers with the bitterness in the finish. 

What a densely flavored beer for something under 5% abv! What a cool beer.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
3549,"2016-03-21",3.9,"Bottle from jamesy -- cheers! As complex as a gose gets.

3549,"2016-03-11",3.7,"This was poured into a stange.
The appearance was a hazy yellow color with a nice transparency about it. Carbonation could be seen rising at a rapid pace to fill a slim quarter fingers worth of white foamy head. Spotty messy lacing sticks to the glass nicely.
The smell starts off with a sharp crisp sweet citrus bumping into the spruce. Leans more toward the lemon as it warms up.
The taste was mainly the same but ends up lacking a bit on the salt content. Mild sour lemon aftertaste leads into a quick dry finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a good sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed to hit appropriately. Sourness hits dryly on my tongue. 
Overall, this was a pretty good gose though the saltiness seems to be lacking a bit. I like the spruce idea. I could see myself coming back to this preferably in the Summer.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Lots of acid, lemon and a touch of biscuity malt. Pleasant enough with no alcohol or flaw.Sigh. Yet again, its just a mouthful of oak and citrus, for the most part. Im seriously stupefied how any one finds Grimms sours enjoyable. Oily, heavily acidic, tannic and heavily citric, its pretty much like an oaked grapefruit juice. The spruce is notable in the flavor, providing some relief (though dry, astringent spruce is not exactly the best for mitigating this already heavily acidic, dry flavor) and the carbonation is tight which helps the drinkability. Certainly not as offensively oaky/acidic/citric as some of their others (psychokinesis, the ""goings"" and such) but nothing Id ever want to drink again.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
