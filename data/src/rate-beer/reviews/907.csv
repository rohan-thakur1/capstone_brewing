Al naso intenso aroma di luppolo, con alcune note leggermente fastidiose. Va peggio in bocca, poco convincente, sa di luppolo vecchio. Inoltre è totalmente scarica di corpo e risulta eccessivamente carbonata e anche un po acquosa. Forse ne avrebbe guadagnato se fosse stata montata a pompa.","Rome, ITALY","Mortlach"

907,"2010-06-15",3.5,"In short: A straightforward and highly drinkable lager hopped like a Pale Ale.  Above average session beer
How: Tap at t Arendsnest, Amsterdam
The look: Clear dark orange body topped by a medium off-white head
In long: The moderately hoppy not is both fruity and leafy.  Body is clean and feels appropriately malted yet the toasted malts do not contribute much to the overall flavor spectrum.  Lager sensation with the lack of fruity esters.  Nice hopping with fruity and leafy hops.  Mild-medium juicy bitterness.  Not much to say about this beer except that it I could drink this all night long.  Feels like a cross between a session lager and an Pale Ale.  Really nice.  Just so you know, Roodborst is actually a little bird.  A little animal who desperately trying to draw attention upon itself just like modern humans do.  By tweeting.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
