Bière à 3 malts : orge dont 30 % de smoked, froment et seigle pour 20 %.
Niveau abv de 11 %, rien moins que 26° plato, et 50 ebu, en format 50 cl.
Mon exemplaire avait été embouteillé il y a 2 ans, le 9 décembre 2014, et était proposé pour 5 ans.
Couleur noir aux reflets roux, à lopacité assez forte.
Mousse brun moyen épaisse, crémeuse, stable à 4 mm.
Arômes de tourbe très prononcé, whisky dIslay, fût, chai, malt tourbé.
1ère bouche très veloutée, à la grande entame maltée, avec une tourbe très massive.
Arrière-bouche longue, massive, avec fruits mûrs et beaucoup de tourbe.
2ème à la superbe texture, mais beaucoup trop de tourbe.
Arrière-bouche très déséquilibrée.
3ème qui marque une évolution un peu ammoniacale.
Arrière-bouche très hard.
Longueur qui intègre beaucoup mieux toutes ces nuances fortes, dans un assemblage très correct, 
et surtout avec une texture toujours magnifique.
Jambes huileuses.
Levure dense.
Alcool qui fait ce quil peut, et parvient à redresser la barre sur la longueur.
Finale sympa.
CONCLUSION : une bière que lon peut qualifier dextrême dans ses saveurs, mais elle est dune 
texture exceptionnelle  Quoiquil en soit, sa cotation est vraiment triste pour moi en cette veille de Noël, parce que mon ami Rick Parfitt de Status Quo vient de décéder à Marbella en Espagne

 Zapach:  Aż trudno w to uwierzyć, ale w aromacie jest pustka:/ Nie wiem co mogło to spowodować? Może nadmierne utlenienie? Piwo było butelkowane rok i 3 miesiące temu.
Niebywałe... Wącham i wącham i na prawdę nic tu nie wyłapuje...Może ze szkła będzie lepiej?
Wybrałem szkło, które najpełniej kumuluje aromaty, czyli TeKu Glass z nadzieją, że będzie lepiej.
Wydaje mi się, że piwo było stanowczo za zimne do degustacji. Po przelaniu do szkła oraz ogrzaniu piwo powoli zaczęło przemawiać do mnie siłą swojej woni.
Nareszcie pojawiła się wędzonka, bliżej dymu z ogniska, która wspaniale współgrała z lekką słodową, żytnią nutą.
Po zamieszaniu kielichem pojawił się karmel, toffi i szczypta czekolady.
Aromat nie wyrywał wciąż z butów, ale powoli obrazował co może zaraz wydarzyć się w smaku...
 Smak:  Od razu po wprowadzeniu drogocennego płynu do ust odzywa się silna nuta słodów wędzonych: trochę bukowa, trochę ogniskowa, a trochę oscypkowa. Z pewnością fani kiełbasianej wędzarni będą zawiedzeni. Nic tu po nich.
Wędzonka zahacza chwilami nawet o torfowe klimaty.
Słody wspaniale kontruje gorzka czekolada, toffi i karmel.
Po pewnym czasie dochodzi do tego wędzona śliwka.
Goryczka jest średniej maści, dość długa z kwaskowatym finiszem.
Kolejny raz ogromny szacun dla Norwegów za arcymistrzowskie zamaskowanie alkoholowej mocy.
A jest ona wcale niemała, bo aż 11% przy 26 BLG!
Piwo gęste jak kisiel po norwesku, treściwe i mega smaczne. 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Uff! Odetknąłem z ulgą. Ten początkowy pusty aromat wprowadził nie lada zamieszanie w moje głowie.
Piwo potrzebowało zaledwie kilku minut, aby otworzyć się w pełni przede mną.
Smak był wypadkową wielu płaszczyzn: nut wędzonych, zbożowych, torfowych, czekoladowych i śliwkowych.
Moc alkoholowa jest zatuszowa pod garstką słodów żytnich i wędzonych.
Świetna faktura i wysoka pijalność. 

Wszystkim degustatorom tego szlachetnego trunku proponuje ogrzać go do temperatury pokojowej, aby uniknąć takich przygód jakie ja miałem przy pierwszym z nim kontakcie.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

On the nose, Lagavulin like smoke notes, with some very faint dark fruit, and vanilla below.

Aromat: zdecydowana wędzoność, która dominuje. Wyczuwalne jednak również wanilia, lukrecja i słodycz oraz nuta alkoholowa (mimo takiej mocy nie przytłaczająca). Z czasem nuty wędzone nieco ustępują na rzecz słodowo- alkoholowych. 

Smak: słodowy, zdecydowanie słodki, nieco owocowy, cukierkowy z umiarkowaną chmielową kontrą. Następie wyraźne nuty wędzone i alkoholowa rozgrzewająca końcówka. 

Przyznam, że miałem problem z określeniem stylu tego piwa. Na pierwszy plan wysuwa się oczywiście wędzoność, zatem smoked beer. Z drugiej strony dość wysoki woltaż i wyraźna słodycz sugerują barley wine. Co zatem stoi na przeszkodzie aby połączyć te dwa style, skoro w aromacie nuty wędzone z czasem słabną na rzecz słodowych i słodkich oraz alkoholowych, a w smaku występuje wyraźna słodycz? Dlatego wyszło mi smoked barley wine i jest to chyba najbardziej odpowiednia nazwa dla tego stylu. Po zakupie dość długo przymierzałem się do tego piwa, bowiem ma ono odległą datę ważności. Z drugiej strony od rozlewu minął już niemal rok, zatem miało czas się ułożyć. I tak się faktycznie stało. Piwo jest nieźle zbalansowane i niemal do końca klarowne. Aromat jest ciekawy i z czasem coraz bardziej złożony. Podobnie smak, który choć od początku słodki trudno nazwać ulepkiem.

Indledes med sødme, dernæst det fælles fodslag, og så slutter den gode dybe alkohol og røgen af. Røgsmagen KAN dele vandende, men undertegnede finder den interessant. 
Lækker mundfølelse med velafstemt indhold af kulsyre. 
Dén, uden tvivl, bedste ""nordmand"", jeg har smagt! The sun has turned for sure!

3089,"2013-12-31",3.7,"Pours jet black with a billowy creamy head. Aroma notes include smoked sausage, fruity, floral, spice, and pepper. I was completely taken away when I took a taste, the aroma is very misleading. The taste is brutally syrupy, sweet and chewy upfront, however the palate develops as you let the beer settle in your mouth. The sweetness breaks down into a distinct smoked meat note, but other notes of thick almost syrupy molasses, floral, prunes, figs, nuts, raisins, spice, with a refreshing finish. This is a good beer but the sweetness really holds its potential  back.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Canmoore"

3089,"2013-12-27",3.8,"Pours a muddy brown with a good well retained head and nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma offers some bright red apple, some dried out wood, and a big smoky maltiness. Its also got some light chocolate and noticeable but well controlled alcohol. 

The flavor is a touch sweet but also pleasantly spicy. Its got a nice multi-layered malty thing going on, defiantly the rich smoky malt is the central character but its got red apple and cherry fruity notes, lots of toffee, some mild tootsie roll chocolate character. There is a little bit of cigarette character to it too, yknow for authentic bar ambiance... I suppose. 

The beer is heavy and sticky on the palate.

Aroma - Intensity: high. Persistence: long. Smells: smoked, alcohol, caramel, chocolate, oak, vanilla, roasted malt, dried plums. 
Appearance - Color: deep ruby brown. Clarity: hazy. Head color: brown. Head type: froathy. Foam persistence: medium. 
Taste - Intensity: high. Persistence: very long. Flavors: the beginning is wonderful covering and sweet due to the alcohol. Than is slightly tart due to rye and roasted malts. There is a hint of chocolate than is bitter and quite dry. The residual is resinous  and balsamic. Aftertaste is balsamic with notes of licorice. Alcohol flavor (and sweetness) is well present at every moment. 
Mouthfeel - Carbonation: medium to low, fine bubbles. Body: structured. Astringency: no. Warming: high. 
Overall impressions - Balance: fair. Aroma-flavor harmony: harmonic. Its a very complex beer, with lots of smells and flavors. Into the mouth is very strong and the alcohol presence is important.

On the palate, it is full in body with a creamy smooth texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a surprisingly nice smoked beer. While the nose is too smoky for my taste, it gives way to a beautiful complex malty roasty flavour. The smoke reemerges, but at that point it is more subtle. 2012-12-01","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

Pours dark ruby tinged brown, almost inpenetrable by light with fluffy latte head. Very phenolic smoky peat notes on the nose. For the first few sips thats all you pick up in the flavour too, though it develops to become redcurrants and rich dark malt sweetness. The rye adds some spicy undertones but its the peated malt that dominates here. A slow sipper but an enjoyable one.","NORTHERN IRELAND","Beersiveknown"

The smoke is there, and definitely some alcohol, it feels a bit too boozy. But there is a lingering feeling that there is lots of goodness here, and as it warms up the complexity comes to the fore. There is sweet maltyness and some caramel in there, and lots more I cannot place in a hurry.

3089,"2012-12-20",4.8,"It seems unintentionally ironical that I have had this beer in my possession for three weeks and the first time I get to sample it turns out to be the 21st of December (NZ time), as close as you could hope for the solstice (Summer here, Winter there). It seems beer bridges the world. So in the spirit of adventure and in the knowledge that at 12.48am this will be my last beer tonight and at 7am when my beloved wakes me up I will hopefully still be drunk on this beer, I venture:
I have pried off the lid and before pouring can smell malt, a whiff of smoke and danger in a bottle. Im REALLY looking forward to this. The colour in the glass is deep mahogany amber with a coarse latte coloured head that thought about sitting there but is slowly losing impetus, leaving a stubborn collar of lace. The aroma first and foremost is tarry smoke, like the inside of a smoke house that has used reddish aromatic timbers. Alongside are aromas of dates, burnt caramel, marzipan, toffee, fruit leather, road tar melting in the sun, rata honey, sawn timber, mace, licorice, cowhide, tree gum, eucalyptus bark. I could go on. I should go on. I have to drink: Oily and slick and then a riot of smoke, oil and burning timber. Caramel comes to the fore and then up comes stewed apricots. It becomes fluffy and sherbety and then dried and I get memories of warmed sweetened condensed milk. The longer it sits, the more I get slightly burnt toast, crackers and fluff (thats the mouthfeel still sitting there. It is rich and velvety with dehydrated fruit, muscatele raisins and blacked trees on the finish.
Troops, this is from just one sip. I still have 95% of the rest of the bottle to go. I can state with relative certainty that it will take me a long time to finish this bottle and that I will be buying more. 
To my friends in the North, you can have your sun back now, as long as I can have more of this.

3089,"2012-11-11",3.8,"Ta-daaa! Rating number 500, finally Im a beer demigod! This one pours a dark copper body with a very small, light-brown head that pretty soon reduces to a thin film with some additional build-up at the walls of my snifter. Some lacing are left on the glass, but not much. The aroma is strong and is dominated by wood smoke and peat, but there are also some smoked meat and sausages. More importantly there are also definite hoppy notes in the back, making the aroma more refreshing than pure smoke and liquid meat. A hint of the high ABV can also be detected. The taste is heavy to moderate sweet and is elegantly backed up by a moderate plus bitterness. Initially the sugary flavour profile is govern by strong notes of smoke and peat with a solid hoppy resinous background. There are also vague elements of overripe fruits that magically transforms into sweet dark dried fruits as the beer warms up. I also get chocolate as the beer reaches a more fitting temperature. The mouthfeel is close to perfect, its lovely vinous with a full body, an oily texture and soft carbonation. The alcohol is masterly integrated. A very nice barley wine and by far the best smoked beer Ive ever had! So, 500 ratings, how many more do I need before I stop feeling like a complete beer novice?

3089,"2012-08-14",4.4,"At first pour, phenolic aromas of band aid were overpowering.. Very much like Islay peated whiskeys... Luckily that subsides and mellows, with more complex aromas and flavors emerging. Smoked meat, bacon and soy aromas and flavors develop, with pronounced layers of caramelized peach and dried dark fruit lingering just beneath the surface. The smokey, peaty, phenolics never completely go away, though remain a pleasant component of the beer and not the overriding flavor. Overall a thoughtful, interesting and complex beer. The texture is soft, smooth and full-bodied, with a luxurious, creamy, weightless mouthfeel... The carbonation is perfect... Velvety smooth.. No bitterness to speak of, though no overly sweet, sticky malt characteristics either... Very wine like.. Balanced, with no detectable alcohol.. The 11% alc is well hidden in the dried fruit and smokey phenols. Better with time in glass, as it comes to temperature. If your not open to phenolic, peaty, smokey flavors, skip this brew.. Otherwise, worth experiencing, even if just for the texture.

3089,"2012-02-12",4.6,"In the middle of winter the four of us were cruising through rural Flanders on a ridiculous & highly expensive beer run, the trunk of the car as well as a part of the backseat were stashed to the brim with goodies as we were driving towards Alvinne brewery. After a couple of stops we were carrying two crates of Hanssens, an assortment of lambics, De Molen, Mikkeller, The Bruery, Jester King, Nøgne Ø, beers, totalling probably close to 150 bottles, so you get the picture, you have probably been involved in a very similar situation. Around us were nothing but fields, some trees & a half-frozen river when suddenly our front wheel sunk into a huge, gigantic hole in the middle of the freaking road which we didnt see, the car bounced up and down with huge brisk absurdity as we saw our wheel cap flying across the road & heard the loudest clunk of glass crashing against glass & simultaneously all of us though OH MY GOD, WE JUST BROKE ALL OF OUR BEER, completely unconcerned for the car, so you know where our priorities lie. Immediately Dave pulled up to the side of the street, as Man-ki got out to retrieve our wheel cap, a process during which he inexplicably managed to loose only his left glove and oddly not his right one. Michiel and I proceeded to check our bottles one by one (because once again priorities) with an unpleasant feeling because once we open our trunk we were greeted by the smell of beer soaking into the carpeting & our bags. Luckily (although I am still missing 1 bottle, Dave did you take one of my beers by accident?) we discovered only 1 bottle did get damaged, one of our bottles of Sunturnbrew of which the cap had partially open spraying beer all over the trunk during the crash, oddly this is the second time I have had this happen with a Nøgne Ø. The bottle being still 60  70 % full we decided (or at least I did) on the spot in one of our Hanssens geuze glasses because well yeah Which led to the following scenery of four guys standing besides a car parked besides a small rural roads amidst fields next to some barren trees growing on the sides of a half-frozen river with huge chunks of ice flowing in it in the freezing winter with an open truck filled to the brim with beer drinking a Norwegian smoked barley wine from a geuze glass, a sight not extremely common in rural Belgium no matter what you might think although definitely not one I am involved in for the first time. The beer was served into inappropriate glassware at the incorrect temperature on the account of it being minus 10 °C outside. The beer poured a dark brown with a creamy head on the account of it being heavily shaken not only moments before but during the whole trip, the bottom of the bottle contained a layer of foam as thick & creamy as whipped cream which I poured upon the grounds as an offering to the gods for saving our beer, our car & us, in that order & preference. With completely frozen hands, I proceeded to drinking the beer, after appropriately appreciating its bouquet first. Passing it around, we hummed all in agreement, this is a pretty damn good beer. Delicious aroma of smoke, with a touch of campfire to it, very meaty, crisp bacon dark malts, Taste follows in suit, creamy smoke, campfire, very meaty, crisp bacon, lots of heavy dark malts, wood, hint of liquorish, tad coffee, cocoa, caramel, dark fruits, bbq, delicious, thick, creamy body, slightly chunky feel to it, maybe because we shook up the sediment, who knows? Little carbonation 50 cl. bottle  batch 474  2009 vintage  Afterwards in an act of uncontrolled madness (only on my behalf) I gave the bottle a Viking funeral.

How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed soon after receiving it through private import in Montreal but already 1.5 year after bottling date (3.5 year before expiration date)
The look: Cloudy dark burgundy body topped by a very small beige head
In long: Nose has alcohol fumes, black pepper grains, some peat.  Taste is almost a meal, rarely have I noted so many flavor elements in a beer that would constitute a full meal.  I noted rye bread, maple syrup, ham, black pepper, date squares, fresh tobacco.  A full complete meal that even included the dessert and the tobacco for the after-meal.  The 20% rye does make a welcome fresh rye bread contribution with a juicy spiciness.  However the 30% smoked malts is almost a no-show with the beer having only a distant smoked peat flavor.  Alcohol remains mostly well hidden.  Full body with a lively carbonated helping drinkabiliaty.  Obviously quite sweet but not cloying.  Overall this was a decent monster beer but Im just not the monster beer type of guy.  A very nourishing beer, instead of eating dinner I drank that beer, not because Im a drunk but because theres no food in my fridge, just beer.

This cushy Smoked Barley Wine sculpts a most savory flavor profile full of peat smoke, medjool dates, caramel and wet wood. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam covers the purplish dark brown.
-Alcohol is never a bother in the flavor profile.
-The very comfortable mouthfeel (rich but never heavy) is perfect to render all the flavors described above. Rye must have contributed to the plumpness.
-Peat smoke appears especially in the flavor profile and finish.

3089,"2011-10-07",3.8,"Bottle @ Bir&Fud Bottega Roma. Tricky one. Honestly i thought this was a smoked IS. definitely a smoked barley instead. wait a moment... a smoked barley wine? Brilliant! I love smoked beer! I hate barley wine beer! customer satisfaction rate 50%, whatever... The beer had a strong solvent (not alcohol) aroma and taste. nothing irritating but i can beat this one was supposed to show better qualities. despite the issue, it was quite good anyhow  . along with the solvent trip, an AMAZING smoked taste put your palate on the silk road: one of the most smooth mouth-feel i ever had. Something like eating the thinnest, tastiest ham slice you could find. you got also some good malt (i got the Rye), toffee, sugar components. 
Ok, it could being drunk in front of your fireplace with a blanket on your lap and a dog sitting next to you; the beer has the quality to manage the situation for sure. but the truth is: itll make you FUCKING HUNGRY with its killer smokiness.

3089,"2011-10-05",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 14, 2013 Bottle, batch #573, bottled 2010-12-21. Pours a pretty black brew, with deep crimson edges. Very fruity aroma, with notes of leather and smoke/barbecue/wood. Yeah, theres almost a bacon-y aroma here. The carbonation is soft and the mouthfeel is full. Fruity start, with lots of leather, turning into a pleasant smoky, woody finish. Some bacon-/barbecue notes here as well. And quite a bit of leather. Really nice balance, neither sweet nor bitter. The alcohol is very noticable in the finish, both in the palate and as a slight burn as I swallow.  Fruity notes as well in the finish/aftertaste. Quite drinkable. Not at all overwhelmingly smoky for me. A bit of a campfire feeling, but I love most everything smoky, so to me this is a wonderful beer! Not mindblowingly awesome, but very very nice! Well crafted! I wish I had an appropriate snack to combine it with!

Update: Another bottle, same batch, almost 2 years later. Today is 2013-09-15. Im getting very much the same as in my initial review, except that the aromas seem quite a bit more mellow and integrated and balanced. Beautiful!

Ive had my heart bled dry by elegid BWs before with molested tweaks like oak aging and the sorts but this one is not that. The BW sour bite is still dominant, which is amazing considering how demanding smoke is in a beers conversation.

Taste is what the description says: a smoky barley wine. All the barley wine qualities are there; the complex malt bill with dark fruits, caramel, oxidation and hoppy bitterness, but it has a nice addition of smoked malts which gives it a smoky character that blends well in with the barley wine aspects.

Heady, warming nose where smokiness comes across in a leathery fashion while malts feel like thick toasted bread. Underlying fruit esters hint at strawberries, raisins, peaches, yellow apples. All throughout, the rye provides both body and spiciness, a trait brought even further by the alcohol, that were the beer not 11%, Id find quite overwhelming. As the closure approaches, the leafy hops make their presence known, but never overtake the more confident other aspects, including a considerable sweetness that remains to the forefront with under these cakey malts commandment. Well, Im a smokehead so I kinda dig the concept, but Im less fond of alcohol flavours and theyre ubiquitous here, so is the sweetness despite the rye/smoke blend attempt at balancing it out.

I was struggling to pick the style (seemed like hoppy barley wine at first glance) but upon reflection can some burning cherry coming through, particularly on the nose. Fair whack of ABV here but the structure is up to it. Fantasic aniseed, spice, fruit cake; lots to like and good layering of flavours.

Les houblons me semblent perceptibles et saccordent avec un alcool floral et épicé bien portant.  Le goût est dans la continuité des choses avec un malt fumé qui sautille sur les papilles et qui permet à quelques fruits et à un toffee de pondre des saveurs sucrées et douces.  Les houblons sont aussi bien présents, aromatiques et amérisants.  Lalcool est goûteux et déploie une force contrôlée.

3089,"2010-10-17",4.0,"2009 US release; Sampled October 2010
A solid pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a two-finger thick amber tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is a dark, concentrated brown color that shows a clear, rich red color when held up to the light.  The aroma smells malty up front, but quickly picks up a soft smokiness that still manages to be the dominant characteristic of the nose.  Somehow this makes me think of smoked dates or perhaps smoked raisins as there is a fruitiness to the nose at the beginning.  At times this seems like it has some woody pepper like notes to it and there is also a rich, caramelized, brown sugar like note and toasted grain character up front.

My first sip is sweet, viscous, rich and palate coating up front.  Wow, this is one chewy beer, very much a sipping brew as small bits are best at a time.  There is a lot of spicy grain character to this; likely the rye contributes this as well as quite a bit of the slick texture.  The beer finishes with a mix of phenolic smokiness as well as a touch of bitter roast grain character.  Sweet caramelized, brown sugar like notes are tempered by the savory smokiness that dominates the finish.  There is a lot of umami flavors going on here, which makes this thick brew that much more a chewy experience; I almost feel like I should be able to stick a spoon in this and see it stand up on its own.  The spiciness, when coupled with the sweetness almost reminds me of cinnamon, though not necessarily in an overly distinctive way.

Quite nice, I am really enjoying the intermingling of rich malt, funky / spicy rye, fruitiness and smoke character.  This is the consummate cold weather, sitting by the fire, tucked into a blanket and armchair with a good book, sipping brew.  I could easily spend a couple hours happily consuming my 500ml bottle and wish I had more of this as this beer is going to age wonderfully.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Oranges and toffees mixed together up front with some toasted caramels. Dark fruits, a light chocolate, berries, leather, and a light, peppery wood.

Mostly dry with some residual sweetness leaving a medium length aftertaste. Full, syrupy body with a light carbonation. Overall, a pretty cool barley wine.

3089,"2010-02-15",4.2,"50 cl bottle.  Pours a clear dark amber to brown body with a small light beige head that faded fairly quickly to a very thin ring.  The nose is a mix of campfire smoke and tropical fruits, making for a very delicious conglomerate even if its extremely weird and unusual.  Theres some candy like caramel and toffee but also that unmistakeable earthiness that only comes from rye.  Very little noticable alcohol for the ABV.  This smells so appetizing to me that its crazy.  The flavor is really unique as well.  The smoke and rye together really meld well.  The underlying caramel and toffee Barley Wine notes express themselves a little heavier on the finish along with a slight band aide like phenol note.  The finish really reminds me of a heavily smoky single malt scotch like Lagavulin 16.   The mouthfeel is full and sturdy with soft light fizzy carbonation.  Not clingy or sticky at all, with minimal to no alcohol heat on the finish.  This was really frickin tasty.  Id drink this really often if this were a little more economical to do so here in the US.  Awesome.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
3089,"2010-02-12",4.2,"THOUGHTS: Wow. A smoked barley wine. Hid alcohol incredibly well. Surprisingly easy to drink for a smoked. Not overly smoked. Just enough to make it interesting. Almost like drinking an ancient beer. Oddly Christmasy. Flavor was way more complex than the aroma, and the aroma was fairly complex   so what does that tell you? An excellent beer as an example of the past. Very good beer overall. It was OK to good with chocolate chip cookies.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a medium to dark brown with reddish, amber highlights and a small, off-white head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing. The aroma was moderate to heavy, molasses and caramel; light to moderate pine and citrus hops; wood, smoke, brown sugar, bacon, BBQ sauce, barley wine smell and slight soy sauce. The hops and smoke blend together. The initial flavor was rather sweet; while the finish was very, almost harshly sweet and slight to lightly bitter with a long duration. There was caramel, apple, cherry, smoked meat, tar, charcoal, a little like BBQ sauce, molasses, a bit of alcohol, a little citrus, sweet orange, barley wine taste and wood. If it wasnt so cloying it would be perfect. The medium body was syrupy and then a little dry, but very sticky on the lips with lightly fizzy carbonation and a ever so slightly metallic and lightly smokey finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"
3089,"2010-02-01",4.3,"500ml bottle. This is a beer I have wanted for a while, but the high price kept me from it. It is worth the price, this is a fine beer. Ive had all but a few ounces of the beer and I have loved every sip. I cooled this down too much and served it way too cold. Served cold it was OK, but with it warmed up to just slightly below room temp, it really shines. The smoke, alcohol, spiciness and over ripe dark fruit aroma is very pronounced, but inviting. The alcohol and smoke combine to make some very unique smells, the sort of thing that would be disgusting if amplified much more, but real nice as a part of the beer and not the whole thing. There are several odd little notes, creosote chiefly amount them. I would also add molasses and medjool dates to the aroma descriptors.  The beer has a murky browinish color with a short lived off white head. Legs galore. The taste is sweet, almost cola-ish at first (more like a cola mix lean on the water) with tons of dark fruit, most overly ripe and fragrant, black and white pepper, woodsy and spicy with a lingering bit of alcohol (burn.) Thick mouthfeel, maybe a lot of residual sugars, but not in an off putting way. The proteins in the rye probably help the body out as well. The choice of malts here is awesome, the smoke malt is enough to impart a wonderful flavor and the rye brings its own spiciness and body to the party, which is big anyway with an oversized barleywine. This would be the type of beer I would love to have a lot of.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

fairly dirty looking hazy opaque pour. it appears chestnut-y reddish/orange brown with a tiny little head... actually, it is more of a tan film which comes to the top of the glass only to quickly disappear. 

sweet mild smoke leads the way in the old sniffer... followed by golden raisins, dates, caramel-y brown sugar, toasted nuts, earthy spice, candy/bubblegum, citrus and plummy vinous notes. 

the palate is very rich but not overly sweet. flavors include some grassiness, leafy dank hops, golden raisins, light ashy smoke, brown sugar, spiciness and some vinous plums. it seems really simple... delicious nonetheless the aftertaste is smokier (and ashy) than the actual flavor itself. alcohol is slight but really doesnt get intrusive. 

it is full bodied (at least for a smoked) and thick but ash, spice and hoppy dryness clean it up and make it incredibly drinkable.

Aroma is distinctly ""Nogne-ey"" with notes of wood, earth, dirt, grapefruit, dark fruit, Christmas trees, caramel, meaty smoke, sweet toffee.  Lots going on, but its all well buried.  Tastes similar with a bittersweet maltiness, caramel, raisins, dried fruit, wood, dirt, char, caramel, mellow smoke; its quite bourbon-like.  Lots of alcohol.  Finishes with a mellow smokiness, dried fruit, bitter wood, old grapefruit, and a big alcohol kick.  The rounded flavors dont seem to match with alcohol bite.  Soft carbonation, rounded oily body is fairly heavy, but not very creamy.  Sweetness is kept in check here despite the strong malt presence.

3089,"2009-09-13",3.8,"Pours a dark, but mostly clear, deep mahogany color with a small, pillowy, light beige head which is mostly diminishing and leaves minimal lace.  Nose is interesting with smoke being dominant but not overpowering, lightly roasty, some scorched wood, black currant, some burnt caramel, and a bit of brown sugar.  Flavor is flavor is nearly cloyingly sweet but bitterness from the smoke and warmth from the alcohol keep it from being so; it starts with sweet notes of burnt sugars and caramels, candied currants, toffee, and some baking spices but soon the smoke enters, almost like a hickory-type smoke, some light roast and faint earthy hops.  Palate is nice with a nearly full body, a silky and round mouthfeel, a light warmth, and a soft to lively carbonation.  Finishes with similar hickory smoke note, more roast and hop presence, and some sweet notes of burnt sugars and toffee lingering.  From the start, I did not have a good first impression with the smoked meat-type smoke but the malt complexity was great, the warmth was nice, and there were just enough other notes to make it interesting.  I do not usually like smoked beers and especially the smoked meat-types but there were enough other things going on that made for a nice offering from Nogne.

brown black cola colored body with a film of greyish head. meaty smoke nose with some light fruit scents to it. very nice smoke flavor that melds into the rest of what is here. no over the top sucking on a piece of burnt wodd flavor. just a nice layer of smoke, not pork, just smoke, not brisket, just smoke. like sweet wheat bread with sweet butter and smoked salmon. tastes like lunch. lingerinfg sweet that goes well with the sweetness. biting alcohol comes out strong on varying sips. but when it stays whewre it belongs this is a joy. a strong caramelized chocolate flavor is under all this with a bit of spice. like a well heated hot cocoa with a bit too much cayenne. im thinking a few more of these would be a good purchase to see how they cange over the coming months.

The nose was a glorious surprise of a deep sensual molassis sweetness with counterbalancing sharp, almost minty hop esters, so to speak.  Theres a deep underlying chocolatey and toffee-like malt base that really makes the nose intriguing.  Spicey intro to flavors at first, reminding me of some vintages of anchors our special ale, with smooth, yet seemingly confusing chocalte and toffee malt notes at first glance, spiked with hop breath, and sprinkled with spice in some rare christmas cookie kind of way.

3089,"2009-08-09",4.1,"Bottle. Pours a hazy chestnut brown hue with hints of garnet and mauve. A thick head of khaki coloredfoam settles in slowly, leaving behind dense sheeting that breaks apart into spotty, cracked rings of lace. The nose is enticing and complex, starting out with a rich chocolate and dark caramel malt base, with notes of figs, dates, hazelnuts, nutmeg and cinnamon. Rye malt lends its distinctly clean, grainy profile, which works insanely well with the potent smoke character. Theres a hint of bacon in there, which is never a bad thing. In short, it smells decadent and delicious. To my delight, the flavor does not disappoint. The rye is the wildcard, its clean sharpness setting this one apart from other chocolaty, caramely barleywines. The nuts, figs, and other dark fruits take the smokiness quite well, and the whole thing just comes together beautifully with a staunch, earthen hop finish. Substantial, slick, and viscous, the

3089,"2009-06-30",3.9,"Bottled. A dark chestnut colored beer with a tan head. The aroma is quite strong with strong notes of citrusy hops, alcohol, and caramel - as well as hints of smoke. The flavor is very sweet with strong notes of caramel, combined with medium notes of citrusy hops, bread, malt, and alcohol, as well as a light touch of smoke, leading to a lightly bitter finish, where roasted notes, alcohol, and smoke lingers for a long time - the smoke note gets stronger as time passes.  The body is sirupy thick, and the alcohol tickles the tongue and palate, and leaves a light burn on the tongue. A Barley Wine with smoke - I like the idea.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

It might be juniper smoked malt.  The rye stands out and is certainly similar to black peppercorns.  Some more dark fruits, though subdued: prune, plum, fig.  Quite malty.  A litle wheat peaking out.  Not nearly as boozy as I expected.  Really, really nice.  This needed a bonfire for a companion.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

Smoky brown sugar and maple syrup and molasses with subdued dark fruit and bitter somewhat burnt lingering finish.  Full body and nicely carbonated in the body.  Definitely an extreme beer.  Very interesting and enticing and assertive.  A unique beer, if there is one.  I love smoked beers but the smoke in this comes out burnt in the finish, perhaps as it intermingles with the rye.  Anyhow, an awesome beer that I wish I liked even more.","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
3089,"2009-06-24",3.8,"500ml from State Line. Dusky dark brown pour, with a minimal carbonation which is okay for the style. Softer and less complex nose than Id anticipated, a sweet and woody smell detectable beneath the relatively subtle smoke. Bodys slightly on the thin side, but pleasantly smooth. Flavor has pleasing depth, a nice base barleywine indeed, and I especially like the way the sharpness of the rye malt complements the big flavor. Smoke is bacon and campfire, a very nice addition to a savory beer.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

3089,"2009-06-20",3.8,"500mL bottle poured into a snifter.

Pours very dark and settles in almost black in the glass with a small creamy light tan head that dissipates to a bubbly ring quickly and leaves good lacing.  It shows through as a deep cola brown when held up to the light.

Aroma takes a while to come out as the beer warms and even when it does its very subdued.  Its got a mix of caramel malts, smoke and chocolate that leaves an interesting sweet/smoky aroma in the nose.  The rye is evident as it warms and a spiciness makes its way into the mix as well.

First taste is of smoked sausage with lots of sweet caramel malts in the background.  The finish is also very smoky and lingers on the palate for ages with a spiciness from the rye which is an interesting combination in the aftertaste.

The mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied and silky smooth, clearly due to the rye presence.  The carbonation is moderate but very soft.

Having tasted the sahti this week as well, I can confidently say that Nogne puts out some of the most creative and style-bending beers in the market.  The smell was underwhelming but the taste is extremely good and a solid mix of different things that comes together very well.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

3089,"2009-03-18",4.0,"Small light offwhite head. Hazy reddish brown body. Fruity wooden alcohol aroma with rye and wild berry notes, as well as sugary raisins. Sweet intense alcohol taste of smoky salt licorice, tar, and tobacco with roasty fruity notes. Full-bodied. Quite a bit of alcohol heat. Sticky, sugary mouthfeel. Bitter roasty licorice and tobacco aftertaste with carraway notes and some bubblegum. Smoky salty juniper taste lingers for a long time. Excellent! Really something new and out of the ordinary. (0.5l bottle at Olympen.)","Oslo, NORWAY","larsga"

Very dark brown colour, nearly black, with a moderate but lasting tan head. Aroma of salt water, tar, smoke and some coffee. Full and rich mouthfeel. Excellent flavour, lots of chewy malty sweetness, roasted notes, coffee, tar, some liquorice, pine needles, salty finish, noticeable hops with just the right bitterness. Very well balanced. Another great achievement from Nøgne Ø.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"
3089,"2009-03-07",3.9,"50cl bottle at Olympen. Batch 400. Brewed 2008-12-21. Best before 2010-12-21. It poured a dark brown, almost black colour with a very small off-white head that settled down very fast in the glass leaving a thin veil at the top. The aroma is a bit smokey and complex with notes of roasted malts, barley and coffee, pine, licorice and dark plums. Some hops and yeast is also noticable. The flavour is bitter and dominated by malted barley and rye, dark roasted coffee, licorice and alcohol, but theres also some pine and dark salty caramel. It feels smooth in the mouth and has a long and lingering aftertaste. The alcohol is noticable, but gives you a warm and pleasant feeling. A very nice beer indeed.","Kurland, NORWAY","espenra"
3089,"2009-03-04",4.6,"500 ml bottle, batch #400 @ Olympen, Oslo. A dense yellowish one-finger lasting head upon a dark reddish-brown, almost translucent body. Delicate sweet and ashy malt aroma. Loads of inviting fruit scents (plums, raisins, ripe berries and tropical), before a fresh, piny hoppiness take the lead. Also some nice whiffs of marzipan, wood and peat. Taste is both powerful and rounded, and perfectly balanced. Deliciously sweet, roasted dark malts with a subdued smoky accent. A bold piny and fruity bitterness together with notes of  wild berries, ash, wet wood and tar. Big body. Feels smooth as silk in the mouth.  Everlasting warm,  bittersweet finish. A unique, and extremely well-crafted beer from Norways finest.","Oslo, NORWAY","OleR"
3089,"2009-03-04",4.3,"Bottle at Olympen, Oslo. Poured dark, almost black with a small ring of offwhite head, near black, red where the light shone through. Aroma was loads of hops, pinetree or unripe mango, some alcohol and dark berries. Flavour was pretty much the same, but with quite a lot of sweetness to it, a good warming alcohol sting, roasted malts, liquourice, tar and smoke. Fairly thick body, low carb, and quite dry. Maybe a bit too hot, could have toned the alcohol down a tad. Still, this is a very nice brew, complex and interesting.","Årnes, NORWAY","Kestral"
3089,"2009-03-03",4.8,"Bottle at Olympen, Oslo (while stocks last!)
Coca cola color, fine lacing.
Strong hoppy aromas, like the middle of a pine forest. Low carbonation.
Tar, old ropes, salt liquorice, tobacco. Lots of sweetness, but perfectly balanced. Alcohol warming, bitter finish. The beer of the year can be declared already!","Oslo, NORWAY","KnutAlbert"
