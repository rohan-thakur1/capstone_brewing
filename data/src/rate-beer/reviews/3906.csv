3906,"2017-02-25",4.4,"Well then. Looks like peach or apricot juice, which fits the nose just fine. Great peach and apricot fresh aroma. Big jammy funky, with a lean towards blue cheese funk. The flavor has enough lemony pucker to not be quite as cheesy, but the fruit really shines in this. Nothing like a traditional Berliner, but a fantastic fruited sour.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
