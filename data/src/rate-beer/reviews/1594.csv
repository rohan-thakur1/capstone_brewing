1594,"2015-02-06",3.7,"300 ml bottle bought at ParkNShop Superstore in Fanling.
Cloudy, hazy coconut milky light beige colour mixed with lots of sake rice particles; Fragrant aroma of glutinous rice wine, with rich rice soup, mashed pear fresh, coconut milk, sugar, shredded coconut, fruity ester and alcohol; Medium sweet taste of sake rice, with strong glutinous rice soup, rice particles, moderate tartness, strong starch, pear puree, alcohol and sugar; Medium body, Thick and starchy rice palate; Mouth feel is like a rice porridge infused coconut milk. Sake tartness is very notable and the strongest Ive had so far for the style. Sweeteness is right-on medium, not cloying at all. Rice particles are coarse, more like having porridge, and with notable but never sharp booze more akin to a Winter Warmer, this is a bit messy but strangely appealing. I like it!... Wet after taste; Starchy and nicely sweet to mouth.

Comments: Once you have so many finely-grinded Nigoris, this is a whole new experience for enjoying the style - a look which resembles Summer coconut drink, coarse rice particles, rich starchy to the tongue, just right sweetness and smart tasty booze that wont knock you off. This is hearty and easily enjoyable. Recommended!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured an opaque, slightly off-white with non head and the only lacing was that of grit.

Aroma is sweet and fruity. Hints of alcohol but not as prominent as with other sakes that I have had. The flavor is fruity and alcoholic. A sourness comes in a shakes things up a bit. The mouthfeel is interesting. Chalky, not thick though. In the end I am not a big fan and am too ignorant to establish this in the pantheons of sake as either good or bad.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

Mouthfeel is somewhat chalky--though it doesnt taste chalky--from the low filtration and kinda watery.  Nothing really spectacular with this guy.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

1594,"2006-02-26",3.6,"Served chilled and shaken.  Milky white, leaves a chalky residue on the sides of the glass.  Aroma of canteloupe, coconut, and rice.  Thick chalky mouthfeel.  Green grape sourness, rice, and alcohol flavor.  Very interesting, and very a very different experience.  I would drink this again.","Rochester, New York, USA","ElJefe"
1594,"2005-11-08",3.8,"300mL green screwtop bottle.  Poured into a small glass its milky white, similar in appearance to a chalky antacid - it looks a bit thick, grainy almost, like a watery rice or potato mash.  Semi-sweet aroma of some grapes, creamy oats and milk.  Moderately sharp alcohol in the nose as well.  Coats the mouth with a chalky, almost gritty semi-thick residue, although the body remains quite thin.  Its sweet, moderately harsh, somewhat milky but mostly chalky.  Not that bad actually, I like how the sweetness and the sour chalkyness are competing.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1594,"2005-10-09",2.9,"This is my most interesting sake experience to date.  After shaking the chilled bottle as instructed, I poured out a thick, milky brew that heavily coated the sides of the glass.  The aroma was rice, alcohol, and a melon-ish scent.  The palate was thick and grainy with the consistency of Kaopectate.  It tasted better than that.  Rice, alcohol, milk, maybe a hint of citrus zest.  It coated the mouth heavily with a chalky substance.  I enjoyed the experience, but doubt Ill have this again soon.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

1594,"2005-08-21",3.1,"Bottle.  Rice alcohol aroma primarily - hints of cream and mint.   Watery milk appearance - looks like a melted pina colada.  Moderate rice, soy sauce and alcohol flavors primarily - slight hint of lemon and a creamy finish.  Has a fine gritty consistency.   Nice but very different.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
