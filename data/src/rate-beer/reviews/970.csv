970,"2015-06-20",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2016 First beer from a new beer company, from a 75 cl bottle which is hopefully still super fresh (a bottle date would come in handy if freshness is such a big deal here!). Lightly hazy, pretty and warm light orange blonde colour with vivid sparkling, supporting a thick, moussy, dense, off-white head thickly lacing on the edges of the glass. Lovely (and flawless!) hoppy and fruity aroma of tangerine, lychee, mojito, acacia honey, a basket of spring flowers, lemon zest, cantelope, fresh apple cake, strawberry, vanilla, biscuit. Refreshing, crisp onset, peach, pineapple and redcurrant, strongish, finely tingling carbo with a highly quenching mineral water effect without becoming overcarbonated; spicy hop bitterness is at that point already showing at the horizon, only to increase in strength towards the finish where, aided by a light but pleasant, slightly nutty maltiness, it achieves a long, dry, resinous, spicy bitter finish, bittering, but very aromatic, floral and citrussy as well. Adding the yeast deposit lends it an obviously yeastier, more powdery mouthfeel, but the aroma and overall flavour remain just as fresh.  Cleaner than I expected, with far less of the overly yeasty character of many artisanal Belgian ales, with a lush and overwhelming hop profile: this is not just any Belgian ale, this is not even a Belgian IPA, this is (almost) a genuine, perfectly balanced, fine-tuned, American style IPA, juicy, extremely thirst quenching and totally refreshing on the longest day of the year... I would never have identified this as being Belgian if I had tasted this blind. A new Belgian brewer who looks forward instead of backward like most others, hopefully this can inspire many others.

970,"2015-03-10",4.2,"Blonde à la mousse blanche. Arômes chargés de notes houblonnées sur les agrumes et fruits exotiques (ananas, mangue, fruits de la passion), très agréable. La saveur est encore mieux. Extrêmement nette et propre. Houblon sur le zeste dagrumes enrobé dune légère douceur maltée. Des notes de mandarine, ananas, et un peu de mangue. Cest un assemblage dagrumes tropicales douces-amères avec beaucoup de sensations végétales (dry hopping). Belle texture en bouche, 6% sans aucun signe de lalcool. Au final, belle amertume avec une touche de lime, fruit de la passion. Excellente bière.","Braine-LAlleud, BELGIUM","manucorazzini"
