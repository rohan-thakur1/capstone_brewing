2374,"2017-06-13",3.8,"1 pint can from Whole Foods. This one pours a darker copper brownish colored cloudy looking body. On the top theres a really big lasting beigeish head leaving a rush of lacings and dots down the sides of the glass. Nosevise its a well hopped one for sure. Lots of fresh piney zesty tones her. Red berries, a nice hint of dark caramel. Yeah, this smells really good this. My kind of aroma. In the mouth it has a nice oily texture and its about average on the carbonation. Hoppy and caramelly in the taste. Dark caramel with red apple, blue grapes, hop pellets and something slightly herbal. Quite lightdrinkable and definitely tasty. 13.06.2017","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

2374,"2016-07-27",4.3,"De la micro cervecera Pipeworks(U.S.A) esta Red Ale que tambien podría ser una Red IPA de nombre Blood of the unicorn , a continuación el por que me inclino mas por denominarla una Red IPA.
Blood of the unicorn presenta una corona de espuma mediana con burbujas medianas y amplias de color Blanquecino de retención por encima del promedio, la actividad de carbonatación que se alcanza a apreciar es poca, el color del liquido es un rojizo turbio con destellos ambarinos que la hacen lucir muy llamativa, con turbiedad que impide ver a través siendo que no es una cerveza tan obscura, esta turbiedad se puede deber a la levadura en caso de no estar filtrada y al dry hopping, su consistencia en cuerpo es mediana.
El aroma que se desenvuelve es predominantemente frutal, de primera impresión se destacan notas a durazno, mango, ligeros toques cítricos y herbales, las maltas se llegan a apreciar al final dando mucho dulzor, corteza de pan, aromas pináceos rondando por ahí.
El sabor de entrada tiene una intensidad en amargor muy considerable, de hecho es la característica que mas sobresale igual que en el aroma el carácter a lúpulos americanos que generalmente son los que proporcionan sabores frutales son los mas notables, se aprecia mucho sabor a durazno, mango, ligeramente cítrico si me preguntaran la fruta exacta diria que sabe a cascara de mandarina, algo de piña, resinosa y al final herbal, sin astringencia, las maltas aportan dulzor a caramelo pero casi no se perciben ya que son opacadas por el lúpulo, muy al fondo se puede saborear un ligero toque a tabaco y pan, el retrogusto es muy persistente, amargo y seco con una apreciable característica tostada , esta cerveza tambien forma parte del top 50 de Ratebeer con una calificación en estilo de 100/100 y el general de 96/100, casi perfecta para los usuarios de esta pagina.","MEXICO","Yased"

2374,"2016-02-04",4.0,"The beer pours reddish brown with a large tan head. The aroma has floral/fruity hops, light pine, semi sweet toasted malt, pineapple and some funk. The beer has a medium body with a touch of a bit and a modest amount of carbonation. The flavor starts with dry toasted malt, spice, pond, tropical hops, citrus and other fruits. The finish has some woodiness added into things. Excellent amber ale.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

Pours deep amber carmel red hue with a small eggshell head with next to no lacing. Nose is deep dark fruits, resinous hops, pine, caramel malt, toasted malt, very nice. Very well balanced amber in the nose. Flavors are big on the toasted malt, earthy herbaceous hops. Body is medium with a very nice full palate for the abv. Long finish with lingering toasted malt and the lingering hops. Solid and a very strong competitor in this category.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"

2374,"2015-08-27",4.0,"Can thanks to Bursprak. Thanks buddy! Pours hazy dark brown with a medium offwhite head. Aroma is dank, hoppy, toasty, caramel, citrussy. Taste is about the same, lots of bitter orange peel, citrus, toasted malts.","Aarhus N, DENMARK","Klimaet"
2374,"2015-08-25",3.8,"They switch from a bottle to a can and I get a new tick? That seems like untappd rules. Anyway. Ill take it. 8/3 date. Color isnt what I would call red. Maybe orange, rusty. No redder than alpha King. Quite a nice hop kick on the aroma. Grapefruit, citrus. Taste is sweet citrus fruit. Again nicely hopped for the abv. The red malt is there a touch on the back end, but it is barely there letting the hops shine. Pretty good stuff and thrilled I can get some nice PW hoppiness for $12 / 64 oz instead of $11 / 22 oz","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
2374,"2015-08-20",3.9,"Poured from the 4-pack of tall boy cans, cloudy more brown than red but whos to say thats not what unicorns blood look like?! Get a lot of tropical fruit hop flavor, and a dry and gritty back end. Not many get the 4 without giving me the 7% (or greater) and this is no exception.","Illinois, USA","TattooJack"
2374,"2015-08-19",3.7,"Can. Pours red with off white head. Aroma has citrusy and pine hop notes. Flavors continue with classic C hops, some pine, grapefruit, balanced well by firm caramel and toasted malt notes. bitterness is fairly high although a pleasant bitterness (not harsh), it does come off too bitter and slightly off balanced. The aroma seems a little lacking as well, I would want a little bigger dry hop here. Otherwise its a very good example of a west coast red ale. Excellent beer really.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
2374,"2015-08-19",4.1,"Can thanks to Bursprak! Pours a hazy amber with a tiny white head. Aroma has toasted malts, lots of fruity hops, cranberry, caramel, citrus, more hops! Damn, this smells nice! Taste is smooth and sweet, slight caramel and a very hoppy finish. Not extremely bitter, but minty hoppy and really fresh. Average to low carb and a smooth, minty body.","Aarhus C, DENMARK","Vestergaard"

2374,"2015-08-11",3.9,"16 oz. can. Pours a deep reddish with a medium white head. The head fades to a ring around the glass. Decent lacing. Aroma of grapefruit and tangerine peel hops, rich red malt. Flavor is medium bitter with nice citrus and grapefruit notes. Medium bodied, above average carbonation. Finishes medium with lingering hop bitterness. A vast improvement.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
