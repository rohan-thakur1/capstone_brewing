3793,"2017-04-30",4.5,"From notes. Enjoyed at Corbets house warming on April 23. 750 mL bottle courtesy of Corbet. The pour is a light hazy yellow straw color with a thicker white head that falls down to a thin film pretty quickly. The aroma is light and clean. There is a light wine barrel up front with a hint of spiciness and a lightly floral hop. The hops are crisp, and really lend themselves to the other aspects. There is a light fruitiness to it, but the wine barrel does mute a fair bit of this. The flavor is excellent. The light wheatiness comes through with a hint of spice and a lingering tart hoppiness. The barrel is prevalent and balances out lovely with the winey grapes that are light and delicate. This is just so balanced and clean. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly tart and clean wine barrel spiciness. Jesus. This is just spectacular.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3793,"2016-11-25",4.3,"Bottle from jamesy -- cheers! Im a sucker for the magic that happens when Hill Farmstead ages their beer in wine barrels, so it was no surprise that I was blown away by this beer. Tried side-by-side with Dorothy, and the difference was stark. While regular Dorothy is hoppy and fruity from the Brett yeast, the barrel-aged version is soft, with a lot of green apple and white wine flavors. BA Dorothy, as a dry-hopped beer, has more hop bitterness than Art or Flora, but it definitely works a lot more than E.. Phenomenally good beer.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

3793,"2016-07-29",4.2,"750ml bottle split two ways at fridge temp. Allowed to be stored upright for a few weeks but the beer did not really clarify. Its still a burnt golden hazy color. 1 finger head that faded fast. 

This smells amazing. Its distinctively Dorothy. Citra, juicy, tropical bright and theres a wine presence and Brett funkiness. Wow. 

Excellent mouthfeel. Its perfect. 

The flavor, its loaded with a ruby red grapefruit acidity. Oranges, a bit of tannic oak. Its actually pretty thick. A little lemon juice and grape skins. It has this flavor thats reminiscent of the most recent batch of E. Which makes a lot of sense

Theres no doubt this is Dorothy. Its just better.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
3793,"2016-07-25",4.0,"750 mL bottle. Hazy yellow. Aroma is earthy brett, very light wine, some citrus hops. Tastes has a lot more white wine. Brett cuts the sweetness of the wine. Light lemon tartness. Bitter finish. Light body. Ive never been the biggest fan of Dorothy because of the abrasive character of the brett. The white wine lends sweetness and just a little bit of acidity that make this very pleasant.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

3793,"2016-07-21",3.8,"Un grand merci à Marc-André pour l partage! Bonne fête mec! Un produit la fois très près et très loin de Mère Dorothy. Robe jaune paille et chapeau de bulles maculé et blanc comme neige formé de grosses bulles persistantes et collantes. Liquide voilé, palais saillant. Un nez où lon reconnaît parfaitement Dorothy. Un houblonnage à cru important qui laisse échapper des arômes citronnées auxquelles sajoutent à cette version de la bière, des notes funky, boisées et riches. La barrique était visiblement pleine de vin blanc car je sens et je goûte une texture qui me rappelle le Chardonnay de par son côté buttery et gras en bouche. Le citron a beau trancher sur le funk longtemps entretenu en barrique, lamertume est réelle et le bois puissant. Une bière qui accompagne parfaitement cette pizza aux fruits de mer danniversaire mais que jaurais sans doute eu beaucoup de mal à déguster autrement.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
3793,"2016-07-19",4.4,"Bottle shared with Nelson at the brewery, 7/8/16.Perfect appearance as expected. Huge white head is well-retained atop a blonde-copper-brass body with a gentle haze, at most, and plentiful carbonation.The beautiful, clear brett of Dorothy is here in full force, though perhaps even more softened/refined from its time in the barrel. Immediately reminds of E., oddly enough, though its cleaner and more delicate, perhaps. Barrel character is reserved and its possible to imagine some wine notes, but theyre very light at best. Plentiful fruitiness; lime, nectarine, lemon and light pineapple all dance about on the nose with very light, soft honey and biscuit-like malts in the background. Rustic, charming house character adds plentiful minerality, completing the picture of a wonderfully hoppy, brett-filled, modestly funky, farmhouse beer. No alcohol or flaw.Exquisitely tight carbonation, as HFs best beers always exhibit softly spreads delicate, lemon-lime-like brett tartness about the palate. Soft, biscuit-tinged malts divulge more honey with warming, helping balance the acidity, though the beer never gets more than pleasantly tart. Juicy, lightly tropical and floral notes emanate from the hops, with low to moderate bitterness and a touch of wood at points, as well as suggestions of wine, if one looks for them. Fantastic stuff, overdone in no aspect. Wonderful balance is one of the best qualities and what separates the best of the best from the rest, as I think it does here.Though I think barrel-aging is much over-hyped and over-used, I think the extra lagering it provides Dorothy here is actually highly beneficial in improving the beer, as I think Dorothy, like Arthur, can be a bit aggressive young.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
