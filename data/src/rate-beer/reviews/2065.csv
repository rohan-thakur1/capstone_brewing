2065,"2017-03-27",3.4,"On tap at the brewery pours a murky garnet amber with some lacing, sticky, off white head. Nose is solid, tart cherry, pomegranate vinegar, raisin, candy, stale red wine. Flavor has some stale cherry soda, raisin, prune, lurking vanilla/wood, a little cherry vinaigrette, some raspberry leaf tea. Dry and tart, lightly tannic. For a house foudre beer, this is good. Approachable with nice structure.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"

2065,"2017-02-09",3.6,"Rich copper and ruby tinted body with a thinnish tan head and an amazing hazy glow that really stands out! Aroma of wild yeastie funk, earth, bread, sour brett, grain, alcohol and some light fruits like apples and pears. Medium-bodied; Assertive effervescence with some pungent yeast and brett characteristics that run a bit long and show some light spiciness, some dry grass and hay flavours and a bit of toffee. Aftertaste is rich, and showing the wild, funky side very strongly with the yeast and light spices as the only strong taste. Some light malt and sugars round out the palate, but this is all about the yeast strain and some subtleties. Overall, a nice beer to sample, but im not sure what any fuss is about on this one, its fairly mundane, albeit nice to sample. I wouldnt go out of my way to try this one though. I sampled this sixteen ounce pour on draught at Whole Foods in Pentagon City (Arlington), Virginia on 09-February-2017 at the end of my driveway.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

2065,"2016-08-11",3.8,"4oz pour at the Right Proper Brewing Production House. Poured a dark ruby red color with a small off-white head. Aroma was light tart notes, stone fruits, sweet. Grains, raisin notes. Touch of sour tart finish on it. Pretty tasty.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
2065,"2016-06-17",4.1,"Tap at Right Proper in Shaw. Dark ruby amber with low tan foam. This one was outstanding in every way - some vinous red wine barrel character comes through in both nose and flavor. Rustic grain and heavy dark bread crust separate this from your regular dark sour into clearly Biere de Garde. Minerally water profile, medium-bodied, with almost no sugar remaining. Still, the acid is super low to almost zero, sugar absent, grain presence is the primary focus. Rich depth of malt flavors interplay within a highly drinkable body. It really was outstanding. Our group went for seconds on this one.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

2065,"2016-04-01",3.6,"Tap. Hazy darker copper brown, thin light tan head. Slight sour dark fruits, some leafy notes, dark cereal malt in the aroma. Flavor is more akin to a light Flanders red, but dialed down. Medium body. Pleasant.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"
