The hops are really active in this amber ale, with an initial whiff of soap and perfume. The amber and caramel and lightly toasted malts take a minute to emerge, and theres some floral and grapefruit and orange character to the hops, with an underlying earthiness. Medium-bodied, with a bitter, smooth mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Great take on an amber ale; hop it up a bit for balance and to make it interesting.

2401,"2014-06-29",3.7,"Very nice biscuity and toasty aromas. Bit of roast adds complexity. Very low hop aroma. Just a touch of grapefruit. Little diacetyl that dissipates fast. 
Appearance is more copper than red with significant haze. The head is a nice tawny persistent froth. Good lacing. 
The flavor is malt forward with strong caramel and toasty notes. Roast finishes the malt with just enough astringency and burnt character to add complexity. The bitterness is low but balances well. Bit of hop citrus and grapefruit on end. 
Overall very smooth. Goes down easy with enough creaminess and smoothness to leave a pleasant finish. Very nice.

2401,"2013-10-05",3.9,"Had on-tap at Bells Eccentric Cafe.

Maybe its because I had it right after Quinannan Falls Lager (which blew my mind), but I wasnt *huge* on this. The beer looks unbelievable with spectacular lacing, but it only seemed ""good"" after that effing Quinannan Falls! A mild hop nose with the caramel is a nice change of pace from the Red Ales that seem to be heavy on the malt. The flavor is not much like the aroma, I found, and it lets you know that youre drinking a red. Debs Red Ale has a significant caramel malt profile (as oned expect) with almost a slight roast flavor as well.

2401,"2008-04-09",3.6,"Draft at Bells tasting. Poured a hazy copper color with an average creamy off-white head that was mostly diminishing and had good lacing. Good malty and citrus hoppy aroma. Medium body with slick dry texture. Moderate well balanced smooth flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration. Good brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
2401,"2008-04-08",3.6,"Light hop aroma.  Malty, full body with little hop finish.  Nice amber, but not my favorite.

2401,"2008-03-24",4.2,"On tap @ Bells tasting. Deep orange pour with an off white head. Aroma of citrus, toasted malt, tropical fruits...all very bright. Flavors of crisp spicy hops, toasted malt, citrus, and a bit of pine. Medium/light body bittersweet with a soft carbonation and a bitter finish. They need to remake this one as it was damn good and would be a perfect session brew for spring. Held up really well.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"
2401,"2008-03-17",3.7,"On tap at the Eccentric Cafe on my Michigan road trip. Pours a reddish light brown in color with a nice half inch head sitting atop.  Plenty of hops in both the nose and taste.  Now this is a red that I can get into.  Not my favorite style, but I would have no problem drinking alot of this one.  Glad I had the opportunity to try.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AllAboutStout"
2401,"2008-03-08",3.5,"Sample at the Bells tasting at Brews Cafe on 3/6/08: This brew is a clear reddish-copper color with a thin off-white head that burns away quickly. Spotty lacing. Aroma of light hops, earthy malt and citrus. Light to medium body with mild hops, toasted malt and spice flavors. The finish is hoppy and malty with notes of pine and citrus in the aftertaste. Above average overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
2401,"2008-03-08",3.4,"On tap.  Pours a clear light red color with a fluffy white head.  Aroma is toasty, grainy malts, and a nice floral/citrusy hop balance.  The hoppiness is very nice but it is quite tamed - I can only guess that this is quite and old sample, it certainly does not seem very fresh.  Taste is smooth, malty, mildly hoppy and low in bitterness.  A bit watery but that could just be the slight staleness.  Grateful for being able to try this one, would love to get the opportunity to try this fresh.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

2401,"2008-02-28",3.4,"On tap at the Eccentric Cafe, a beer Ive been searching out now for the 5+ years Ive been on RB. Deep red-brown body, thin buff head. Toasty nose with piney hops. Medium-bodied, nutty, and chocolatey, with a firm piney hops bite. A nice red ale. This batch was listed at 7% ABV at Bells.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
2401,"2008-02-21",3.6,"had this on tap at crunchys in east Lansing.  Flavor was slight citrus and a nice hop profile balanced by nice biscuity malt.  Very drinkable and nicely balanced.  Best red ale Ive had.","Holt, Michigan, USA","masonjer"
2401,"2004-04-17",4.1,"Is there something in the water in Kalamazoo, or just something in Larry Bell's blood, sweat and other bodily fluids that makes everything these guys make stand apart from everything else?
Cleverness abounds in Bell's country, for their red is not named after any Deborah, but the famous unionist, Eugene V. Debs. A murky red color, spicy nose, quite hoppy. Flavors of plums, raisins, cinnamon. Malt is substantial, but not dominant. Medium body, but thick and full with flavor. Remarkably soft, smooth, and spicy!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
2401,"2003-12-16",3.7,"Cloudy amber with just a little bit of head. Nose is citric and floral. Nicely balanced--hoppy, sweet, and lightly tart.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
2401,"2003-08-26",3.6,"Copper hue with a rocky off-white head and very good lacing. Malty and piney aroma with hints of grapefruit, earthy yeast, and hay field. Nice balance on the tongue between malty sweetness and hoppy bitterness. Dash of spice and tart fruit thrown about for good measure. Bitter and smoky undertone finish. The thin to medium-bodied brew has a fizzy and slighty metallic mouthfeel. If the taste didn't fade towards the finish, I would have rated this beer among the best in the standard Ale style. Still it is very quaffable and worth trying at least once.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
2401,"2003-06-30",3.8,"Bottled. When I poured this beer into my glass, it poured a mall tan head that had medium sized bubbles that fully diminished. The lacing was good on the sides of glass. The body was clear and the hue was reddish. It had a moderate hoppy aroma and also an aroma of clove and a hint of citrus. There was no carbonation present with this beer. It was bitter tasting from start to finish and the bitterness seemed to linger for a while after finished this beer.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
2401,"2003-06-29",3.4,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2003 This brew pours a small head of mostly diminishing fine light brown bubbles and a medium amber brown body.  It had a hoppy aroma and a somewhat smooth thick flavor of hops, malt and spices.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
2401,"2003-02-16",3.4,"This beer is a lot like sports in that it is a game of two halves.  To begin with, I misinterpreted this beer from its name.  ""Red ale"" made me think it was a mild amber-like beer, although coming from Bells I did suspect they'd make it interesting.  (When I first saw the name ""Eugene V. Debs"" I saw it on the board of a legal history class I had as an undergradute, and I thought it was a court case: Eugene *versus* Debs...silly me.  But now I understand how this is a play on Debs' ""red"" communism.)  At any rate, this started boldly, reminding me of an English strong ale or mild barleywine, so full of raisin and vintage flavors in a malty body.  It had tang and zing, with a bubbling carbonation released in the mouth.  But it faded for me into a sour and slightly watery ale, leading me to wonder whether this was inspired by a Flemish red ale.  Wonderful aroma and hazy red-brown body (with lasting bit of off-white head)...but those flavors...they collapsed in the second half for a real disappointment.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

2401,"2003-01-08",3.9,"Deep coppery red, with a slightly juicy hop aroma.  Caramelly, wtihout being sweet.  Effervescent bubbles tickle the tongue.  This is a low alcohol beer of the highest quality.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"

2401,"2002-12-31",3.7,"An elegant, upscale Amber.  Another hard to find, once a year Bells, but well worth the hunt.  If you treasure a great Amber/Red, you will love this beer.","Dallas, Texas, USA","dukefan"
2401,"2002-12-22",3.9,"This is what Bells Amber wants to be when it grows up. Beautiful red-amber color, nice off white head, good body toward the light side. Moderately malty, pushed almost to the extreme with hops. Nice clean finish. Just like all other Bells beers, the yeast character presents itself. The hops seem to keep that under control. Always decant a Bells beer. Not sure if this is still a seasonal, but I would drink it year round.","Highland, Indiana, USA","BATLMULLET"
2401,"2002-12-14",3.6,"Amazingly good for a beer of this style, and much better than Bells Amber. Hoppy and refreshing finish. Malt seems slightly smoked and sweet. Thin but not bland, very flavorful.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"

This beer was a dark reddish amber color and had a nice off-white head which left some lace. It had an aroma of malt and hops. The flavor was of the malt and a slight citrus taste which is common among the Bells beers. The finish was a bit dry and it had a medium body. Not a bad beer","Ohio, USA","Gunshy"

2401,"2002-10-11",3.8,"Debs is still my write-in candidate for the Governor of our great state of Indiana.  I also continue my email campain to get a better, historical label and to get it renamed Eugene Debs Red Ale!!!  The beer itself pours dark, dirty penny copper with a lively, lasting head. Strong malt nose with more alcohol in the nose than actually in the beer itself.  Clean, tingly hops try hard to burst through the thick, sweet malts but are barely restrained, just as this amazing, heroic Hoosier had been during his presidential campaign of 1919/1920. Bells has another winner, please email Bells and plead for a better label and to add his first name to the brew!","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
