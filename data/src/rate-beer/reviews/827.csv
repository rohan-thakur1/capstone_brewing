827,"2015-11-30",3.8,"355 ml tall can bought at HK Brewcraft in CentraL.
Looks: Translucent golden honey colour; One finger head with crumpety white foam which lasts for 90 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with notable slight carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant full Pils malt, with very strong lemon, grapefruits, passion fruits, floral, grains, molasses, biscuits, and strong grass.

Taste: Strong sweet Pils malt, with barley grains, strong floral, strong honey, strong molasses, biscuit, yeast, strong lemon, very strong bitter hops and very sharp grass.

Body: Medium body. Dry and oily palate.

Mouth Feel: Full Pils maltyness in a full and quite viscous body with quite strong grainy taste. Lots of floral. Sweetness is very strong but malt-based, not cloying and tasty. Dry bread plus lots of lemon and grass to round. Excellent!

Hoppiness: Very strong lemon, grapefruits, passion fruits, floral and strong grass in nose. Massive floral / lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness is very strong, close to German Pils level for a lasting, high astringent bitter-sweet finish.

After Taste: Dry. Sweet and strong bitter to mouth.

Comments: This aint no ordinary Imperial Pils - the hops got intense and nice fruity flowery aroma and equally impressive in taste. An honest to none grain bills, with massive maltyness and nice sweetness. This is German Pils being magnified with good hoppy effects. Yes!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"
827,"2015-10-14",3.5,"Bought at Beertopia 2015, drank with Matt whilst watching first Democratic debate. Clear light orange/tan, fizzy moderate white head, watery foamy legs. Smells of heavy white pepper/spice, very dusty hop, grain/cereal, spiced malt. Taste is white pepper, heavy bitter resinous hop, light lemon/spice. Body is slick, medium, a bit of pepper/lemon, lightly frothy. Lots of flavour for an imperial pilsner, plenty of pepper and bitterness. Nose is more musty and taste is more resinous. Pretty decent beer.","HONG KONG","CacheManyHose"
827,"2015-10-14",3.5,"Can from Beertopia 2015 at home. Clear golden pour with sticky crop circled head. Aroma is grassy hopped pilsner. Taste follows - more rounded out pilsner, less crisp, more grassy hops, more honey malt. Smooth bubbly palate. Lasting pilsner bitterness. Not bad. Probably wouldn't get again though.","HONG KONG","HKdIPA"
827,"2015-10-04",3.3,"From 355 ml can. Brilliantly clear yellow-gold with a fluffy lasting white head and fine carbonation. Aromas of cut grass, crackers, flowers and lemon zest. Taste starts off lightly but a firm pepper and citrus zest bitterness ramps up pretty quickly. Theres more citrus and a grassy note at the end before the expected clean finish. Gentle lime juice like aftertaste. Pretty good.","Camp Hill, AUSTRALIA","Jado"

827,"2015-09-10",3.7,"Can from Beer Cartel 100915. A fair bit of fruity citrus in the aroma which is a bit different to most pilsners I have had. Good strong body and a clean white head. Full in the mouth with a thick creamy mouthfeel that you just dont get from a pilsener. Long finish. A beer that I could go back to.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
827,"2015-06-26",2.3,"Can, 8C. Very pale gold with a large white head. Grainy aroma with grass, herbs and lemon. A bit fumey, then theres a load of overt alcohol in the first sip. Blech. Grainy and husky with honey, lemon, strong herbs. Bitter and boozy at the end. A little better as it warms but decidedly not for me.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
827,"2015-06-19",4.0,"Can - pale gold pour with big white head. Aroma is hoppy, soapysome straw and a bit of biscuit. Taste is sweet initially then the hops kick in and the finish is dry and lingering. Palate is smooth and creamy. Hides the alcohol very well.","AUSTRALIA","Dervock"
827,"2015-06-19",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 20, 2015 From a 355ml can on 19/6/2015. Pours a clear medium golden with a small bright white head. The nose is grassy and herbal, with a hint of citrus. Flavour wise, it starts with bready and biscuity malt, followed by orange and lemon, some honey, and distinct herbal notes. Highly hopped, with a nice sticky bitterness countering the initial dash of sweetness. The palate is lovely - long and slick, bordering on syrupy. You dont doubt its 8.1% but its it still pretty easy to down. A really good imperial pils. Great to see Aussie brewers producing world class gear like this.","Canberra, AUSTRALIA","Maris"
827,"2015-06-13",3.5,"Pale gold pour with a decent white head. Grassy, big grain aroma, some citrus and lagery dirt. Taste is grassy, crisp, bready, bitter. The bitterness carries through, a little booziness too","AUSTRALIA","varanid99"
827,"2015-06-10",3.6,"Let's start at the end because that is the most striking element of the brew. Mammoth hop finish with a bit of alcohol. Goes from crisp start to power late. 355ml, 8.1%, 2.2 std drks.

827,"2015-06-02",3.6,"At just on chilled and into a snifter. Looks the very fabric of what a good pale lager should. Translucent and vibrant; a sunny medium gold with little life and a messy white foam that holds and laces well. Grassy, herbal, earthy and raw is the aroma with hints of lemongrass, mint, baked kale and spicy alcohol. On the palate it is clean, grassy and herbaceous with a grand noble and new age hop presence. Bitter and crisp with only a sly warmth from that alcohol. It is all raw hops in the aftertaste. Very light in body with good bounce offered from the carbonation. The malt is toasty and grainy giving the hops a firm backbone. Slightly sour down the sides of the tongue; fruit esters are minimal. It is restrained somewhat compared with how I pictured it. Drinks far too easy for the ABV. Certainly is a pilsner thats medded up on far too much roids. Nice stuff!!(35,5cL can, BB 03/05/16, The Liquor Shed, Jandakot)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"
827,"2015-05-28",3.7,"Can from cellarbrations superstore in Hami hill. Pours golden with a thick creamy head. Carbonation is lively with a medium body. Aroma is earthy, grainy, slightly citrus. Taste is earthy and lemony. Booze is evident but not too overpowering considering the ABV.","","alberti92"
827,"2015-05-25",4.2,"Can from Beer Cartel and on tap at The Durham Canberra (May 2015). Clear, bright golden/amber, 2cm white head, earthy/piney aroma, solid earthy bitterness, sweet biscuity malt, full body, thick texture, alcohol well hidden in a long bitter finish. Excellent.","AUSTRALIA","ShaneJ"
827,"2015-05-10",3.4,"On tap at the Durham, Canberra. Pale amber pour with medium head that fades quick (to be expected with high alcohol). medium carbonation. Big noble earthy/herbal noble hop aroma. Malt sweetness up front, moderate-high hop bitterness on the finish. nice enough but not sure Im a big fan of the style. A half pint of this knocked me about!","Los Angeles, California, USA","RafeAU"
