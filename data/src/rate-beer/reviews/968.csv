968,"2017-04-05",3.7,"Enjoyed at the Casey tasting at Jeffs House on April 02. 750 mL bottle as Brett Devo. This baby gushed all over as soon as the cork popped. The pour is a darker golden orange with a thick white head and a couple spots of lace as it recedes (very slowly). The aroma is something else. There is a strong sweetness to it and a funkiness that just cant be ignored. There is a lot of yeast and bready malts backing that up. The flavor is lightly citrusy, but the strong funk really kicks in. The bready malts arent my thing at all, and this seems far too yeasty. I think there was some over-conditioning in the bottle. The mouth feel is a little heavier and really brightly carbonated with a bitter rind and sweet funk on the back end. Its something else.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
968,"2017-02-03",4.2,"0.375l corked bottle from Ølbutikken. What a head! A gigantic monster of a head on this one that never settles down. Would even go so far as to call it everlasting. Really big bubbly, lacing and white in color. All this on top of a blurry straw golden beer. What a bretta lovely aroma. Lately Ive just completely fallen in love with this brett aroma, and to my luck, it seems like they kind of beers is popping up everywhere these days. Fantastic funky with a soft lemony sourness, lots of slightly sour berries, gooseberries, white wine, a little bit of straw and it just smells summery and fantastic. As expected its not directly flat on the carbonation this, rather on the other side of that scale and it has a light oily mouthfeel. Not much sweetness left in this email. As good as bone dry actually. Really refreshing, and the brett has gone completely bananas. Funk, straw, lots of brett, something slightly minerally and as mentioned not any sweetness left what so ever here. Such a interesting and exciting beer.

968,"2014-07-05",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 24, 2014 355ml bottle. Pours a hazy golden amber, with a small off-white head, which lasts reasonably well and leaves decent lacing. Oak, leather and grapefruit are backed by a decent level of sourness to create the aroma. It is quite sour up front, with (oddly) some strawberry notes coming through. Light malt sweetness, oak and leather come into the mid-palate, with a nicely sour finish. All in all a highly enjoyable sour. I should note that on a previous tasting this rated a 0.9 and one of my very few sink pours ever, as it was totally flat and undrinkable. This bottle came from the same lot at the same shop, so it was not a BBD issue, which suggests to me that quality control at this brewery needs tightening up.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

A: Beautiful gold color with an active foamy white head that dies down into a 1/2"" with good retention. Good bubbles. Some lacing.

Really well-attenuated, thankfully, without any malt heaviness. This is approaching orval, but for the hops. That being said, the brett is absolutely stunning. So well done its succulent and almost sugary in its depth. A study in brett brut? Sure, why not. Very peppery carbonation but as it breathes its still quite tight and engaging.

968,"2013-03-21",3.5,"375 mL bottle from the Best Damn Beer Store in San Diego, served in a snifter.

It acquires a significant pepperiness towards the end. The finish is long, malty, fruity and funky. On the palate, it is medium in body with a dry texture and intense carbonation.

Pours hazy orange/gold with a huge rocky white head.  The head is impressive, slowly receding and leaving caves and crevices behind, leaving not clumps but freakin chunks of foam on the side of the glass.

Aroma is fruity and spicy.  Tart lemon, pineapple, tropical fruits, kiwi, sour green apple, yeast, touch of vinegar, hint of funk.  Brett is more in a fruity stage right now.  Very good strength.

How: Bottle 750ml.  Tasting session with Montreal crew.  Mega-thanks to beerbuzzmontreal for this gem.
The look: Cloudy orange-yellow body topped by a very small white head
In long: Superb nose of barnyard.  In mouth the beer feels very wild and very alive.  Somehow not so bretty but definitely very wild, like a very wild barnyard Saison.  Flavours of cookies, fruits (but not specific fruits), a bit juicy, sweetness reminiscent of a freshly baked pie crust.  Rather hoppy with plenty of floral hops.  Light juicy bitterness.  Wonderful beer.  The only way Ill ever find a better Devotion is to go out with a very very ugly girl who knows Im her last hope.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
968,"2009-06-01",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Bountiful floral hops expand atop biscuity cereals and coniferous brettanomyces impressions before earthy hops establish courteous bitterness and dryness compels one to get another big gulp of this very handsome Wild Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the cloudy beige-orange.
-Carbonation is frothy but soft, and the mouthfeel is healthily authentic.
-This might have a stronger finish than the regular Devotion?
-The earthy hoppiness and the brett work amazingly well together.

968,"2009-01-12",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 17, 2011 2008 release; sampled January 2009; Served at ~58°F / 14.4°C into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip. 
The beer starts out with a four-finger thick, dense, tan-tinged, off-white colored head.  The head leaves lots of lacing sticking to the sides of my glass and it also forms some rocky & mesa like structures as it slowly recedes.  The beer is a pale-red tinged, honey color that shows a brilliantly clear orange-gold color when held up to the light.  The aroma is nice and hoppy with notes of hay, lemon grass, a touch of pine needles and a nice herbal note.  Underneath this the Brettanomyces is noticeable; it is still pretty subtle, but contributes aromas of rubber, a touch of muskiness, and a soft barnyard note.  There is also some sweet, grassy grain character and some cracker like malt that I noticed as I was trying to figure out the Brett aromatics.

The beer has a dry, grassy and herbal character to it up front.  The middles sees a peppery carbonation and the Brettanomyces kicks in with some tongue coating phenolics that remind me of rubber and musk.  A light malt sweetness in the finish helps accentuate (or maybe it is the other way around) some fruit notes reminiscent of pear and apple.  This beer is quite light bodied, which is very nice, though there is a certain palate fullness to this beer that seems to be wrapped up somehow in the Brett phenolics.  This has an almost velvety texture to it that is quite nice in a beer that is this dry, light and effervescent as this is.  The hop character provides a nice bitter hop bite as well as a touch of lemon zest citrus character that morphs into a Meyer lemon note and then even tart orange (this moves more towards orange as the beer warms, though it never loses the lemon zest entirely); there is also a nice herbal component that mixes with the Brettanomyces phenolics.  There is a hint of cracker like malt flavor to the finish as well as a grassy grain note that gets wrapped up in the hop character.

I definitely like this a bit more than the standard Devotion, the Brett adds that little something extra to this nicely hoppy Belgianesque ale.  The sharp Brett notes actually compliment the hop character.  I really wished I hadnt missed out on picking up a couple extras of this beer, one is simply not enough.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
968,"2009-01-12",4.0,"Very funky. The brett changes this beer dramatically from a nice ale to a funk bomb. Almost like an old school farmhouse style with some hint at the Devotion we knew before.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
968,"2009-01-11",4.2,"Appearance: Pours a hazy, pale yellow body with a frothy, delicate, snow white head.

Smell: Lets see what we have here. Lightly malty, pleasantly floral aroma with fruity notes of pear juice and melon and encapsulated by a restrained, funky Brett component.

Taste: Slight pale malts and a meager sweetness. Floral, fruity aspects with a distant hint of spiced sourdough. Sip of still mineral water. All the while, lightly funky Brett tastes weave in and out of the flavor, imparting cotton, dust-covered cobwebs, and old leather bound books. Belated pithy, herbal hops and bitterness. Finishes bone dry and rather crisp.

Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Moderate carbonation.

Drinkability: A tasty upgrade to the standard Devotion. The somewhat more subtle Brett addition allows for some fine penetrating complexities without losing sight of the original beer or suffering from lack of drinkability.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The brett is also coming through very nicely, which again is not often a given with LA brews.  And it all works well together.

The taste was slightly more funky, especially as it warmed, but the underlying Belgian characteristics were the most dominant - Belgian yeast, spiciness with some light fruits. The hops hit the tongue right up front but fade a bit as the brett presence grows.

This mouthfeel is very light and crisp with the hops and brett playing together on the palate. The carbonation accentuates the light mouthfeel.

Not the best Ive had from Lost Abbey but a very, very drinkable beer that uses brett as a subtle, not overpowering element.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

968,"2008-11-20",3.4,"Pours hazy gold with a small white head and good lacing.  Wheaty, bretty funk in the nose.  Taste was dry; sourdough dough with a rye-ish bread crust.  Melons and wheat with light citrus.  Very bretty.","San Diego, California, USA","trokini"
968,"2008-10-07",3.4,"(Draught)  Pours a hazy golden body with a small off-white head.  Aroma of grass, floral, honeydew, and oak.  Flavor of florals, citrus, light brett, and some herbs with a oak finish.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
968,"2008-09-30",3.3,"Tap at Night of the Funk. Piny nose, very thin, vegetal, pale, dull. Flavor is alright. Yeasty, a touch of oak, a hint of sour. Not much in the way of barnyard characteristics. I think this needs to see some aging for the brett to show a presence, though I don’t think it’s the kind of beer that would do well with any horsiness.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
968,"2008-09-28",3.8,"Bottle from 08 Night of the Funk. Straight up a bretted up Devotion, and tasty.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
968,"2008-09-28",3.9,"Bottle sampled on 09/26/08 at Night of the Funk.  Pours a cloudy yellow with a thick white head.  Aroma of melon, citrus, Belgian yeast, and wheat.  Flavor of Belgian yeast with a slight tinge of citrusy hops.  Slight tartness.  Pretty much exactly as advertised: a bretted up version of Devotion.  In my opinion, its an improvement!  Quite tasty and delicious.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LilBeerDoctor"
