219,"2017-05-06",3.6,"5/6/17. Crowler thanks to ibrew2or3! Copper pour with nice khaki head. Huge coffee aroma, almost a sweet latte in a way. Lightly sweet flavor, coffee, latte, caramel. Tasty!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
219,"2017-04-16",3.6,"12 oz can. Gold in color with a decent white head and clear in appearance. Aroma is lots of coffee, a flavored roast with caramel and hazelnut notes. Taste is of toast, coffee, heavy caramel, and brown sugar.","Arlington, Texas, USA","jkwalking05"
219,"2017-04-16",3.4,"Can. The look is hazy, a white head, and golden in color. The smell is coffee, roast, caramel, cappachino, and malt. The taste is similar, lighter, coffee, nutty.","Dallas, Texas, USA","travita"
219,"2017-01-11",3.4,"Pint at Casey Moores Oyster House. Clear golden appearance with a white head. The aroma and flavor is dominated by a strong roasted coffee note with hints of chocolate, vanilla, caramel, earth and grains. Not bad overall, and pretty good for a ""Kölsch"". It should probably be listed under Spice/Herb/Vegetable.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
219,"2016-12-20",3.2,"damn it tempe, what did you do, use the water from the lake? Off, tons of coffee, not much else, just dennys coffee here.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
219,"2016-12-11",2.7,"Can 355ml.
Pours clear blond with almost no head. Aroma is of coffee, cream. Taste is of coffee, vanilla, malt, cheap amarula/baileys. Palate: Light-medium body, medium-high carbonation. Overall: Not my style.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","Minderbinder"
219,"2016-11-25",2.3,"What a strange idea... Pours a clear pale golden with a thin - err, no - white head that leaves nose lacing. Nose is of coffee, lactose and milk chocolate. What. The. Fuck. Of course this is a coffee kölsch but that is not delicate at all. Taste more of the chocolate and lactose covering everything else (whatever light cereals that are trying to shine through). Sweet. The exact opposite of crisp. Body is light to medium, carbonation moderate and while mouthfeel is watery the drink itself is cloying as fuck. Just a really stupid idea. I maybe would have tolerated it if the coffee was toned down and there was none of that fake flavoring but for now it is a big NO.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
219,"2016-11-24",2.3,"Can (12 oz), shared. Slightly hazy golden with a small white head leaving little lacing. Aroma is of coffee, hazelnuts and not much else...awful. Taste isnt better with coffee, hazelnuts, chocolatey notes and mild herbalness. Light body, watery. Medium carbonation. Coffee and hazelnuts finish. This is disgusting. Zero for the style of course but thats a pretty bad idea. Rarely you see a beer that light that is so cloying. Go drink some real Kölsch guys and stop brewing this s**t.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
219,"2016-11-24",2.1,"can shared by tom10101, thanks bro! pours unclear very light gold with a small white cap offering some retention and lacing. creamy coffee, lactose-an, tons of natural and fake hazelnut flavours, lightly honeyed maltiness, clean lagering yeast somehow. moderate carbonation, light body- thin; semi-sweet chocolatey finish. no crispness, artificial flavours, yucky.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
219,"2016-11-17",4.0,"Can. Pours clear golden, small white head, decent lacing. Aroma is huge creamy coffee; it does kind of smell like a caramel latte. Flavor is about the same, really interesting. Kolsch? No way. Good beer? Hell yes. Light body. Hedonistic rating system, here I come.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
219,"2016-10-25",3.5,"On draft at the Phoenix airport. Served in a red solo cup. A really nice coffee and caramel nose. Not your grandfathers Kolsch. The coffee and caramel dominate everything and little of the Kolsch is noted. It is tasty, though, and very easy to drink.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
219,"2016-09-27",3.8,"Golden yellow pour with small white head. Aroma is huge coffee, malts and grains. Taste of coffee, malts, grains and caramel. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, creamy mouthfeel, perfectly balanced. Such a simple beer but delicious and very drinkable.","Calgary, CANADA","maley1"
219,"2016-09-18",3.8,"Taunt flag! .. .bon draft sample . . Medium gold .. Solid foam, good lacing .. . Coffee grounds, cereal, straw .. Mild roast in the back .. Quite well done, curvy stuff .. . . No bongrip for you mr president!",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
219,"2016-07-07",3.8,"Can thanks to Seth. Pours gold with small white head that diminishes to nothing. The aroma is strong roast coffee and chocolate. Medium body, cocoa, roast, light bitterness, very nice.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
219,"2016-07-01",3.5,"Strong coffee aroma that does not leave much else noticeable. Pale, clear golden pour with thick white foam. Surprisingly rich taste of coffee, tending toward mocha. Lightly sweet and faintly bitter. The sweetness became more evident as it warmed up. Crispness at the end. Active carbonation. Purchased on recommendation. Very pleasant surprise. I would never have guessed the kolsch and coffee combination would be so enjoyable.","Pennsylvania, USA","PanMarek"
219,"2016-06-25",1.9,"Another Huss beer with flat characteristics and synthetic tastes. I wont be buying again.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","jayandlili"
219,"2016-06-06",3.9,"Draft. Clear pale yellow. White head. Deceiving looks. Iced coffee with cream and sugar. Light and refreshing and very easy to drink. Well executed.","Arizona, USA","beerbaaron"
219,"2016-05-30",3.0,"Thanks to Travis for this unique extra! Dégustée en compagnie de Ju-Lo et Karine. Couleur blonde, tête presque inexistante, look filtré. De allures ordinaires pour un liquide extra-ordinaire (lire dinterprétation). Arômes de café vanillé, sucré et artificiel. Jai limpression de bonbons fourrés à la vanille française. Un côté désagréablement cendreux ne fait rien pour me titiller dans le bon sens. En bouche, encore plus de cendres. Cest sec, caféiné, effervescent et supporté par un goût de mauvaise bière presque industrielle. Je ne comprends pas ce liquide qui est ni une Kölsch, encore moins un café, et surtout pas une bière. Un liquide?","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
219,"2016-05-28",3.7,"Bottle. Poured a clear dull gold color with a white head. Aroma of coffee, cream, caramel. Creamy coffee flavor, that works really well. Creme brulee element to it.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"
219,"2016-04-17",3.6,"Can from kbudd19, thanks Kevin! Pours brilliantly clear gold with a medium, frothy white head, short retention with light lacing. Aroma is moderate vanilla, cream and coffee with lightly sweet Pils malt. Aroma is crisp Pils malt, soft earthy coffee, sweet vanilla cream and a dry finish. Light body and medium carbonation.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
219,"2016-04-14",3.6,"Can thanks to Jeff, thanks! Pours a clear gold with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has lots of coffee with a good amount of sweet grain and a decent amount of cookie. Flavor has coffee, sweet grains, caramel and a slight cinnamon note.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
219,"2016-04-14",3.6,"Can thanks to Deyholla! Gold pour with a small head. Coffee and beignets on the nose. Earthy and sweet. Mild coconut accents. Flavor is bready and lightly creamy. Coconut toast. Mild earth. Supple and easy going. Creamy. Nice ""kolsch"".","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
219,"2016-04-08",3.7,"Can. Yellow with light white head. Aroma is vanilla latte, mocha, and caramel. Taste is mocha, grains, light vanilla, with a crisp clean finish. Very drinkable, interesting beer, surprised this works so well.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","kbudd19"
219,"2016-04-01",4.0,"Wow what a surprise. Pour from a can. Really nice coffee / latte nose. Big coffee in the taste, cream-ale finish. Cool, unusual beer. Crushable and refreshing.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
219,"2016-01-12",2.9,"Ok kolsch like beer. Can at Papago. A bit interesting but only so so drinkability.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
219,"2015-12-25",3.8,"Hella good. Gold pour. Creamy coffee, richer flavors than I couldve ever expected. The use of a kolsch base may seem odd, but it works.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
219,"2015-10-14",4.9,"This is the best purely coffee beer Ive ever had. Its an amazing cup of coffee in beer form. Smells and tastes exactly like creamed coffee except with a perfect kolsch twist blended in, mostly in the aftertaste, and it marries oh so well with the coffee flavors. Light, flawlessly carbed, and very very drinkable. Wow.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
219,"2015-09-06",3.4,"32oz crowler pours with a clear gold body that supports an off white head. The aroma offers up coffee notes smelling like a medium or light roasted coffee bean. Theres not much more aroma to find behind the coffee. The taste delivers an initial coffee sensation as well as a seemingly out of place sweet vanilla note. As it warmed that sweetness turned more malty. To midway the coffee allows a bit of mild grainy maltiness as well as a sense of floral and spicy hops to surface briefly. Pretty fun beer but I get little resemblance to a Kolsch as its too sweet and the coffee muddles the potential crisp hoppiness I enjoy in a proper Kolsch. The coffee is on the pedestrian side but maybe thats the best fit here. I wonder what a more earthy and faintly tobacco nuanced coffee might do in this?","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
219,"2015-09-01",3.8,"Clear golden growler pour with one inch foamy head. Highly fragrant aroma of coffee. Lots of coffee and butterscotch flavor with a light vanilla finish at the end. This would be even more decadent paired with donuts!","Arizona, USA","StephTamiko"
219,"2015-07-16",3.3,"Pale golden hue, mostly clear, with very little head. Bold, coffee-forward aroma is packed with hazelnut and vanilla. The flavor is equally stuffed with coffee, but it tastes a little artificial. Finishes with a soft fruitiness.","","PartyFowle"
