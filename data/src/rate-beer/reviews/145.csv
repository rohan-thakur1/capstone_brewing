145,"2016-12-24",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 26, 2016 Pours a darker golden with good legs. Nose is of cooked apples, peaches and burnt wood. Taste is moderately sweet and pretty acidic with brown sugar flavors and really tart cider. All the acidity cuts into the sweetness quite effectively. A weird bitterness in the finish. Body is medium and mouthfeel syrupy. A little sticky. A nice ice cider that could do without that burnt sugar/wood.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

145,"2016-02-26",3.9,"375mL bottle from AdamChandler, dont remember exactly but I wanna say it was 2011 or 2012. Drunk on 2/20/16.Raspberry-red with deep caramel-amber tints and good clarity. Light sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Still.Boisterous red fruits, heavy caramel and lovely black pepper all surge forth. Quite forceful but with a little bit of vanilla dryness and some spicy cinnamon.Sweet red macintosh with black pepper and light raspberry again. Vanilla, toffee, caramel and such, but Im not getting the citrus and bitterness suggested in the commercial deScription. Still, it dries out on the end, though in a bit of a dull way (nuttiness, yeast, sediment). Not massively layered in the apple sugar depth like Cachee or some others, but still a very, very nice ice cider. Lightly syrupiness, but not too sweet, nor watery.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

145,"2015-02-19",3.5,"Bottle @ Mondial des Cidres de Glace 2015. Rating of the 2010 vintage. Slight rose color. Very sugary and maple syrup forward. A bit of apple skins and sweet caramel sauce. This particular cider really lacked any of the normal acidity and is more just sweet and sugary. A lot of caramel, apple pie filling, and brown sugar.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

Sticky sweet apple fruit up front, leading into a sugary simple-syrup middle, but ending with a tart apple skin acidity that carries some nuances tropical fruits.

Deep aroma, somehow different from the other ice ciders; very fruity, with mature apples, some acidity, and a light biscuits note; very light acetic too. Very sweet but possibly less syrupy than expected; excellent flavor of mature apples, moderate acidity; distinctively from others, it doesnt have the same sugary feeling and stewed apples, but it has a very light and pleasant astringency.Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

145,"2011-06-23",3.5,"Pour is clear, thick copper.  Nose is kind of light, apple juice, tropical fruits.  Fairly thick mouth, coating, syrupy.  Not nearly as overtly sweet as most apple ice wine.  Tart, acidic qualities are allowed to shine more here.  Of course, a rich apple essence, but with mango, pineapple, and an assortment of acidic, tart tropical fruits.  Acidity and tart flavors interact strangely with the heavily thick body.  Not sure what to make of this one.  Unique, for sure.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
