4401,"2015-01-18",3.3,"Bottle.

Head is initially small, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing.
Body is dark brown to black.

Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, unsweetened chocolate), lightly hoppy (herbs), with notes of minerals/stones and char, hint of cassis.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

Surprisingly decent considering the other 2 beers Ive tried from Squatters were both drain pours. Minerally and relatively authentic nose. Drinkable balance albeit ultimately too sweet Pretty good job.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

4401,"2014-12-28",4.1,"Squatters Black Forest Schwarzbier has a thick, foamy, creamy, beige head, a dark brown appearance, and very heavy lacing left behind on the glass. The aroma is of dark malt, brown bread crust, and standardized ""beer smell"". Taste is of creamy, dark malt, brown bread crust, sweetness, and subdued bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit slick, and Squatters Black Forest Schwarzbier finishes crisp, refreshing, and highly drinkable. I can see why this beer has won seven major medals.

4401,"2008-09-17",3.8,"On tap at the downtown brewpub in Salt Lake City, Utah. Pours a beautiful dark reddish brown hue with a huge light brown head. The aroma is full of roasted malts and some light fruit. The flavor was excellent; tons of malt here, roasted and full. A nice fruity flavor, sweet but not too sweet. Some light hops and a very nice full and creamy mouthfeel round it out. Just an excellent beer. I wish this was bottled so I could ship some out. Squatters kicks ass.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"

Nice tight black malt flavors ... solid, solid malt with a nice little Teutonic hop bite to finish it off.  Among the better Schwarzs Ive head in a while, think this would go toe-to-toe with Kostritzer. (#2791, 4/12/2007)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
