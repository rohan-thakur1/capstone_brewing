The beer was pretty nice though. I loved that they just have the one beer, and its Koln ""kobe-style"" - served off of big trays whenever youre ready.

 Was soll man von der Mutter aller Schwarzbiere schon großartig schreiben? Jeder, der schon mal in der wunderschönen Stadt Prag war, ist wohl auch im U Fleku gelandet. Ein wahrhaft bierseeliger Ort der Bier, Tradition und Lebensart ausstrahlt. Das Bier ist sehr dunkel und hat reichlich Schaum. Das Aroma ist primär malzig mit etwas Bitterschokolade. Der Antrunk ist toll süffig, weil alles andere als schwer und süß geraten, Meisterklasse! Ein geradezu erfrischendes Schwarzes mit tollem Nachgeschmack nach Toffee und verhaltenem Röstmalz. Mit dem nächsten Bämbel geht das Geschmackserlebnis vom neuen los. Dazu noch das leckere Essen verbunden mit dem Tuba- u. Akkordeonduo mit ""Viva Colognia"" und der Bierhimmel ist so nah!
Tolles Brauhaus, tolles Bier!
Prag ist immer eine Reise wert!

1360,"2012-01-27",3.7,"Draft at the brewpub, summer 2011.  The mugs flow freely here, and with good reason.  The beer is damn solid.  A dark and cloudy, chocolate mahogany body shows just a glint of crimson at the edges when its held to the light.  A thick and spongy head sits like a khaki pillow, leaving tall, looping arches and trailing spots of lace on the glass walls.  The nose suggests of exceedingly fresh rising pumpernickel bread and younger sweet, dark dough.  Rich caramel sugars are present, but not at all heavy.  Coffee and cocoa roast lend a soft edge, while a very light egginess and twangy yeast end things on a clean note.  Flavors follow suit, nice and caramelly up front, with softly toasted dark bread notes.  I get a hint of yeasty Hawaiian sweet rolls as well.  Cocoa and mocha roast lend ample robust flavoring.  Its again kind of eggy and slightly acidic on the finish.  The palate is smooth and easy, showing a moderate, creamy body with fine, cleaning carbonation that comes through on the finish.  Damn good beer.  I could drink it all day.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1360,"2011-12-07",2.9,"19/11 Draught at the brewpub. It poured very dark body with brownish head. Sourish hop, caramel and coffee malt aroma. Light flavor, sweetish caramel and toffee are dominating, but coffee is present and get its time toward the finish, which is bitter (coffee) and slightly herbal. Thinner to medium body. Some kind of hybrid between dunkel and schwarzbier. Not bad, but definitely nowhere near the top and, as of so high rates here I expected much more. I wasnt really feeling so good that day, so it also might affect my opinion, but doubt it did so in larger scale.","Split, CROATIA","heavy"

Pours a dark brown with a light tan head and a bit of lacing. Thin collar. The nose brings a slight amount of roast as well as some mild hops and a slight acidic cherry character. The flavor is mostly malty with a bit of roast and some noticeable Continental hops. A bit of cherry there as well. Light body and slight acidity.

How: Tap at brewpub (Pivovar U Fleku, Prague) 
The look: Almost black body with a large tan head.
To me a typical Czech Tmavé (Czech Black Lager) is: Dark malts and barely any roastiness sensation.  Some dark fruits flavours (raisins with a little figs, dates and prunes) wrapped in smooth dark caramel (borderline toffee) and a subtle chocolate note.  A bit bready.  Moderately sweet without much hops presence and only a mild bitterness (voluntary unbalanced it seems).  Very smooth body, like a watery cream.
This one: Pretty much as above.  Typical example of a style.  Overall slightly above average quality-wise.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1360,"2008-01-27",3.1,"Draught, U Fleku/Praha.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting.
Body is dark brown to black.

Aroma is moderately malty (toasted grain, molasses, chocolate milk), with a note of vanilla.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.

Fun atmosphere (except the waiter who kept bugging people to take the shots of apple schnapps or whatever the heck it was...leave me alone!) with the accordian guy and lots of singing from the guests.  The beer is just ok, kind of boring.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

I had 5 on the row in there, its hard to stop drinking this wonderful beer!

Also tried it on bottle brought back from the brewery, it was not at all as sweet and nice as it is at the brwery, even though I only bought it 21 days before drinking the bottle. Still, the drink at the brewery on draught is awesome, just not a good idea to buy it and bring it back home...

Its quite expensive at this classic (the worlds oldest) brew pub, and a real ""tourist trap"" indeed. But the beer has a special character to it and its still a must to go to the place to try it out. A bit spicy, quite dark brew.

The Festivities:Spicy roastiness and fruity vanilla arent helped into fulfillment by the light and quenching body. Nagging sourness sits at the forefront, while mild caramel undermines the quiet finish. Burnt bread comes sporadically, but cant stick because of the lack of malty rotundity. 3.2/5

BTW, as madsberg here correctly noted, the staff of the pub is focused solely on the profit and cares little about customer satisfaction and friendly mood - the prices are inflated compared to other places in Prague's centre and waiters will ignore your wishes and try to sell you as much liquer (even rather than their beer - probably because of profit margin) as possible.","CZECH REPUBLIC","Valheru"
