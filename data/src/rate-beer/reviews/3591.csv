3591,"2012-11-16",3.1,"A glass at a local Japanese restaurant.  Came with no head. Light yellow in color. Nose of alcohol and rice. Medium body. Flavor is moderately sweet with some bite. Finish is alcoholic.  Despite my comments this was overall pretty good. l","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
3591,"2012-01-25",3.3,"Bottle. No head (still). Body is very light yellow. Aroma is notes of vitamin B, melon rind, grain/rice, alcohol, mold. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery/silky texture, no carbonation, moderately alcoholic, lightly astringent.  Pretty ordinary all-around, especially in the nose.  A bit more alcohol burn than most.  Clean overall, silky mouthfeel, and well balanced, but ultimately it just doesnt set itself apart from the norm.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3591,"2011-04-06",3.5,"this sake is strong in with sweetness but has a definite mellowness. the polsh rice along with the grass brings a nice complementary drink. ts mouth feel is slightly oily but not too strong.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
3591,"2011-04-06",2.8,"The aroma is ricey with alcohol and a touch of grass. The appearance is clear. The taste is slightly sweet and like the aroma with the alcohol well hidden. The palate is slightly oily. Overall a very subtle and well done sake.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
3591,"2010-08-25",3.3,"300ml bottle at Seito Sushi, chilled.  Pours clear and still, with a light yellowish tint, almost the color of apple flesh.  Some dense, drippy legging shows on the glass.  Aromas are simple and inoffensive, showing notes of creamy rice pudding, almond milk, light pear, and just a subtle suggestion of koji.  Flavors too are far from complex, again based in sweet rice with a touch of creamy, pressed almonds, accompanied by a general, soft, indiscernible fruitiness.  Flat, smooth, and creamy on the palate, the body is pumped up with a relatively prominent sugar contingent.  Though there are no off flavors here, Id say this is a bit too sweet and lackluster for me.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
3591,"2010-08-14",3.1,"Clear clean pour with a rice and abv aroma. Musty rice flavor with an abv kicker. Very thin and watery.","decatur, Tennessee, USA","decaturstevo"

3591,"2010-02-15",2.6,"Thanks to maniac.  Pours almost clear with just a twinge of pale straw.  Nose of almost nothing, except some alcohol.  I dont know how to even describe this.  It has some riceyness? and alcohol.  But not as much as I expected.  Also a fake 99 bananas quality.  Not my favorite","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Butters"
3591,"2009-09-12",2.6,"Clear.  Only faintly, ever so faintly a tinge of the faintest straw yellow.  Aroma almost like sweet bubblegum.  Flavor is fruity, followed by an unfortunate alcohol burn.  9th Richmond Gathering, thanks to maniac and dkachur for helping me knock out my sake ratings.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

3591,"2009-05-21",3.5,"One of the thicker sakes I have had, but still clear.  On the dry side, with light fruit.  Much better than average palate, and the alcohol does not ruin the flavor.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3591,"2009-03-21",3.6,"bottle pours with a slightly gold sheen.  The aroma is fruity, melon like, perhaps cask like.  The flavor is awesome, slightly salty, melon, woody.  The palate is more body then I expected.  White chocolate as it warms.  More coating palate.  Overall, very nice.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"

3591,"2008-08-01",3.8,"$38 for the bottle at Ichiro.  I don’t know if that is considered a good price or not.  Pours a yellow tint with a nice neck.  Smells of faint apples, sweet rice, vanilla, boozy.  Tastes of sweet rice and fruity.  Refreshing.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"

3591,"2006-01-29",3.1,"Clear with a touch of yellow, this has a not unpleasant perfumey aroma with traces of melon in the background.  The high alcohol percentage is surprisingly well hidden.  The flavor is light and fruity with a little sweetgrass added in.  Finishes quite dry.  I know little about sake, but this is worth repeating.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

3591,"2005-07-12",2.7,"Very light yellow. Aroma of cardboard and a hint of fruit. Very neutral flavor--not even a touch of alcohol. Im only not completely trashing it because its easy-drinking. But definitely not worth the $11 I paid for it.","Winchester, Virginia, USA","jmuhops"
3591,"2005-03-11",1.4,"Clear light amber.  Aroma was alcohol with faint touches of floral and fruit.  Flavor was rubbing alcohol.  Found a style I like less than Belgians.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
3591,"2004-08-12",3.0,"Light beige. coconut aromas with some mango and light alcohol. Nothing really in the flavor department. Some bandaide, some mango, and a slight musk. Warm, tangy palate.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"
3591,"2004-08-08",3.6,"Clear yellow with thin legs. The aroma is fragrant with oats & dusty grains. Light fruity nuances with almost no alcohol in the notes. The flavor is neutral and a little dry with a light impact. Decent sake, subtle with some alcohol notes but unremarkable. A little buttery.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3591,"2004-08-07",3.2,"Still new to some of the different styles of sake.  Heavens Door is not too bad.  The alcohol is evident in flavor and finish.","New Jersey, USA","beerslayer"
3591,"2004-02-01",3.4,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2004 Modrately yellowish (surprising!) and the most perfumey of tonight's 4-sake tasteoff.  I was a little disappointed with Heaven's Door's fair amount of alcohol burn and color.  I'm also not sure why at a 55% seimaibuai it's not listed as a Ginjo rather than a Tokubetsu.  I'm starting to feel like Prefecture determines a great deal about a sakes taste, just as terroir in Burgundy dictates the taste somewhat.  A little on the dry side, and fairly acidic.  Disappointed as I had higher hopes.  To its credit, Ama No To was surprisingly flavorful with the perfumey-ness of the aroma pervading the flavor making it fruity and candyish.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
