4307,"2012-09-24",3.3,"Draft at Princeton. Pours out a clear golden color with a small white head. Aroma is of light grainy cereal, and mild hops. Taste is a lot more complex than aroma, nice grainy bread notes, biscuit, sweet malts, light grass and a lingering bitterness on the finish.","Ocean County, New Jersey, USA","pineypower"

Gentle sweetness, almost peppery.  Sweet and grainy, some nice esters into a long pungent bitterness.  Very nice, easy drinking and refreshing.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

4307,"2008-08-10",3.3,"In short: Nice blonde session lager.  Well brewed, nothing stands out.
How: Post-Mondial 2008 tasting session.  Hand-bottles brought to Montreal by Dickinsonbeer.  Paul rules!
The look: Clear blonde body topped by a small white head
In long: Unmistakable larger sensation, some fruity notes of citrus and pineapples, some dry grassy hops in the finish.  This is a nice little session lager, well made, well balanced but not very memorable.  Highly drinkable even if nothing special.  I cannot really tell you how true to the Dortmunder it is as Im really not familiar enough with the style.  I am actually so unfamiliar with the style that until recently I thought a Dortmunder was a Star Wars villain.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4307,"2008-08-09",3.3,"[1458-20080531] Bottle. Wheat germ bread yeast aroma has a bit of flower. Clear, light orange yellow body with quick white bubbles. Bit of yeasty bread flavour has some wheat. Light body. Nice yeast, fair.

4307,"2008-06-09",3.7,"Thanks to hophead75. Pours a pale hazy gold. Has a white head. Sweet grassy nose with some bready malt. Bitter. Hay in the flavor, earthy, malty, nice balance. Very sessoinable.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
4307,"2008-06-05",3.7,"Objectively speaking:
Clean and tasty blonde lager from a hand-bottle generously brought by Paul.

I like:
Well-extracted pils malt flavours. Gently bready, soft, almost doughy and fresh, albeit not bursting with freshness. Active and engaging carbonaton does not manage to enliven the mouthfeel to crispiness level, it remains rather round, even for the style. Soft herbal hop aromas seem to evoke a certain mineral aspect that works well despite the beer being a lager.

I dislike:
While the beer is never too sweet, it does not evolve much towards dryness as the finish approaches. As a result, it seems a bit sweet in the finish, as if it forgot to evolve. Not as refreshing as the top examples with regards to that.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4307,"2008-06-04",3.2,"2008-05-31. Crisp yellow body with a small white head. Sweet, floral hops in the aroma, touch of buttercup. (6+) Mild grains, more buttercup like floral hops in the flavour, very light bitterness. Average to light palate. Meh, decent example of a style Im not particularly fond of.

4307,"2008-06-01",3.6,"Growler from Triumph. Well its not the most comlex style out there but this is one nice easy drinking brew. Pours a thin looking clear golden yellow with a large foamy birght white head. Aroma of brown bread and white grapes. Palate is edium bodied with light carbonation. Flavor has a strong grainy prescence with some sweetness on the middle flavor and a slightly bitter finish. Highly quaffable and nice and smooth.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
4307,"2008-06-01",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Bready and honeyed ramifications ebb into crisp cereals as polite herbal hoppiness  trickles onto the flavor profile and finish of this cheerful Dortmunder.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A thin slice of foam floats atop the shiny, clear golden.
-The mouthfeel is extremely clean and quite well rounded.
-I felt like this was on the malty side of things; hoppiness could have been a little brighter to achieve balance. But then again, maybe it came out as intended.
-This is extremely drinkable, yet fails to have me long for more like a TDD Germaine can (for example).

Hand-bottled; thx Paul!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
4307,"2008-05-19",4.2,"Growler from Princeton. Clear golden in color, with a nice frothy long lasting tall white head. Aroma is great, with alot of fresh pils malt: fresh bread, light honey and a nice dose of spicy, earthy noble hops.  Taste is extremely well balanced, and clean.  Alot of pils malt, fresh bread, a light honey sweetness, and earthy/spicy hops.  Medium bodied, full for the style, with a dry crisp hoppy finish.  This was phenomenal, and a nice suprise, although Tom usually does a great job with pale lagers.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
4307,"2008-05-18",4.2,"Tap at Princeton.  Pours a nice clear medium to light golden, lively carbonation and a nice rocky lasting pure white head- with awesome lace.  Aroma is insanely fresh pilsner malt, very bready and doughy, with a clean balanced earthy and spicy hop profile- also some sweet malt hints- trace hint of sulfur but you have to search for it.  Flavor is crisp and clean with tons of fresh bready malts, light dough and cracker- some sugary full sweetness, and a mineral-like character in the very end.  Bigger body than most lagers like this, and I have a feeling this is more than just 5%.  Great representation of a dortmunder, and an awesome lager all around.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
4307,"2008-05-17",4.3,"20080517  Tap at Princeton.  Clear, dark golden with a small but lasting, lacing, creamy off-white head.  Steadily streaming visible eff.  Aroma is ripe with clean nutty malts and just a touch of fruity yeast.  Breezy and refreshing juxtaposes hearty and full mouthfeel with soft eff.  Long finish is of yeasty baguette.  Zero hint of diacetyl, this is so clean and so solid.  Gorgeous beer.  Mild bitterness exposed with amusing noble hop burps.  Bought a growler.  Good one!","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
