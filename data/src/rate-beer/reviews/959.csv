Very floral and fruity (mangos) aroma, with a big dose of brett. Very fresh and fruity, i really like this surprising mix between mangos and brett. Flavor is quite malty, with bretty notes, dry, also some fruity notes, honey-watermelon perhaps, and hoppy floral flavors.

959,"2017-05-23",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2017 May 2016 bottling reviewed one year old, pours hazed amber with a tall and sticky head, just barely crawling up out of the bottle when the cap is removed. Funky, buggy, nearly acetic apple-like (malic) brett impression, covering dense orange and apricot fruitiness.   Its medium-light bodied, lightly sweet with some low acidity, more tart and musty across the middle turning slightly sour in a wet finish. It seems to have survived out one year, no surprise given what it is, but still too much of this green apple and white vinegar resemblance, which thankfully subsides as it warms in the glass, the aroma showing more cork and old books / leather. Theres still plenty of sugar left but the carbonation is a mess, over-effervescing right out of the bottle (which comes across as disjointed / loose), before settling out in the glass after a couple of minutes, where its richness and sweetness overtake the diminished CO2 making it feel weighty. Fresh pours have more pizzazz and brighter carbonic acid.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

959,"2017-04-17",4.3,"My Bottom Line:
Earthy, coniferous wilderness meets oranges and flowers in this spritzy Wild Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam laces atop the cloudy pale amber.
-Complexity and drinkability are rarely as good friends as they are in this one.
-A soapy touch seems to come from the floral bouquet.
-This might be even more pleasant (and drinkable) than Orval. Will have to try them on the same day next time.

959,"2017-02-14",1.6,"Avant de commencer ce commentaire de dégustation, une précision simpose. Je suis un fervent opposant de la prédominance de lacidité dans la bière (et dans toute boisson dailleurs). Lacidité ne connaît pas la nuance et va empêche le développement des autres arômes. Pour certains cela leur rappellera éventuellement lenfance et les bonbons acidulés, mais cela ne fera jamais de grande bière. Dailleurs, aucun grand chef ne travaille uniquement sur lacidité. Celle-ci devant être utilisée seulement avec parcimonie pour devenir un exhausteur de goût et donner un peu de peps. Ayant compris que les levures de type Brett étaient bien trop puissantes pour respecter lamertume et le malt, la brasserie de la Senne a apparemment cherché quelque temps (notamment en coopération avec Cantillon) avant de découvrir par le biais dun brassin amateur, cette souche de levure Brett plus respectueuse des arômes. Doù lespoir que je mettais en cette bouteille. Espoir vite corrodé par la dégustation qui finit dans un bain dacide ayant anesthésié ma bouche. En verre, il ny a rien à reprocher cependant. Un blond abricot voilé (EBC au alentours de 25) avec une mousse blanc cassé; très généreuse et crémeuse de deux centimètres environ. Leffervescence est quant à elle très marquée avec de très fines bulles. Concernant le nez, si je souhaitais être correct, je dirais quil est bien entendu sur lacide avec des notes de lambic et de cidre. Mais, force est de constater que celui sapparente à certains détergent pour toilettes. Lattaque et la seconde bouche nous laisseront un peu de répit. Celles-ci étant plutôt bien équilibrées avec une acidité contenue permettant aux autres arômes de marquer leur présence. Ainsi, la première bouche présente une bel équilibre malt/houblon/acidité sur des arômes de pomme, et la seconde bouche, plus maltée laissera sexprimer des notes de caramel, dabricot et de poire avec une arrière bouche sur lamertume. La suite? Un vaste champ de bataille où lacidité ravage tout sur son passage et une subtilité des arômes annihilée (sur une bonne longueur en bouche que lon regrette, une fois nest pas coutume). Une conclusion : un bon détergeant! (et grosse déception venant de la brasserie De la Senne)","FRANCE","jybi"

959,"2016-11-13",4.4,"330mL bottle, bottled in February in 2016. Been sitting on the self of State Line Liquors for a few months. Well, that turned this bottle into a brett bomb, just what I was hoping for. Pop the cap and at first it doesnt look like a gusher. But after a few moments it start foaming up the neck. The St. Louis flute glass wasnt prepared for this mess. Had to get a second glass but that wasnt enough. It wasnt a furious gusher but a slow and consistent gush. This lead to a big head and a sticky, foamy lacing. A dim golden, slightly hazy color. Aroma is brett-brux-irific. Still some swet Belgian biscuit malt and a really farmhouse herbal cobwebs. And the herbal brett hasnt turned bitter. A lovely still sweet and bretty aroma. Flavor is malty without the sweetness I get in the aroma. Then a drying bretty herbalness takes over and takes you into the aftertaste and farther. A soft mouthfeel that surrounds the carbonation that tickles the palate lightly. At 6.5% this falls into a nice middle ground between Allagash Little Brett and Blvd Saison Brett. At $6 a bottle, its at the upper end of what I am willing to pay again.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Did you like Green Flash Rayon Vert, but were bummed when it was effectively discontinued almost as soon as it came out? Well, this little numbers got your back, friend-o. Its a bit like Orval, but to me more like Rayon Vert, with more fruity and plastic notes than Orval usually has. Dry and bitter, but with more residual sugar than Orval (and a bit less than Rayon Vert had). And like both, an appearance to die for...clumpy, sticky, beautiful head that lasts forever. The only thing keeping this from 4+ territory is the strong plastic odor that distracts me from the nice things...have had it twice now (once at Holy Grale and once now in my rental house), and both times that doggone pool toys plastic note just keeps me from falling in love with it. Which is a shame because its otherwise almost at the level of Rayon Vert and Orval.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Slightly hazed orange. Lathery mountain of white meringue hangs around for an eternity. Extraordinarily soft and bright nose of plaster, almond skin, dried papaya, pepper, medical tape, horseblanket, hay fields, black tea. Very subtle note of melanoidins (browned shortbread), cookie and lactic acid. Fluffy mouthfeel. A remarkably soft and stunningly integrated surge of papaya, rich flower nectar and pillowy maltiness captivates on initial sip. Honey-drenched tropical fruits exhibit a deep, oozing sappiness that elegantly clings to all pockets of the palate and induces a deluge of saliva. Buoyant haylike malt cradles the peppery, but well-integrated, tealike hops and complements the subtle lactic twang with an understated complexity, maintaining a delightfully fluffy base throughout which evokes an expansiveness akin to steamy white cake. Dabs of snappy cookie and almond skin supply structure. Well-measured push of peppery phenols and cottony brett cleanses the palate with a profound ""airiness"", which vivifies the masterfully extracted malt and squeaky-clean attenuation. Malt is seemingly weightless, yet somehow satiating at the same time as its plentitude of soft and succulent textures pervade the palate with a host of gently sweet toasty and cookielike intricacies. Brett-derived sherbety notes line the body with tremendous brightness and just enough fruit-laced sturdiness, which builds on the lustrous fruity esters in the juicy center. Very balanced and clean finish reveals a woody, peppery, and bitterly herbaceous hop grip capped with drying horseblanket and brisk phenolics. Another audaciously hoppy charmer from Yvan and co., comprised of all the yeasty nuance and malty elegance one could possibly ask for, two features that so few brewers are capable of attaining these days. The clumpy white meringue and creamy mouthfeel is just a bonus. The brett brux strain is on full display here, and the end result here is a beer thats every bit as impressive as the sublime batches of Orval.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

A good dose of malt sweetness creeps in, with light caramel and honey balancing the acids. Definitely fruity, as the commercial description indicates, with an enjoyable, bright pineapple and nectarine character that lingers on the end, alongside light pepper and hickory notes from the brett. No alcohol or flaw. Maybe a touch of grainy, bare specialty malt, but otherwise quite nice.In the mouth the malt wraps itself about the brett as I get a sense of strong caramel-like malt notes, though not overly sweet, easily balancing the peppery-floral brett character with a lingering pineapple-lime-hickory character that is quite interesting. Light hop bitterness and a touch of spicy, moderately ctiric juiciness from the hops, complementing the fruitiness. Tight carbonation, very soft texture, though the acids and light graininess from the specialty malt keep it from being too sweet or mushy, if you will.

Almost one dimentional, but theres a lot going on in the background , making this a very complex beer ! Bit sweetness, obviously the Brett factors, malty, even a bit hoppy , some Candy like ( snoepkesketting ) sweet style of fruityness. Very full , intense. Lovely ! One of the best de la sennes to date !","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

959,"2016-07-10",3.6,"Bottle @ Nuetnigenough. So the barman told me that this beer is a result of De La Senne introducing a strain of brett that was isolated from a bottle Cantillon Gueuze into a pale ale. Cool idea. Hazy Amber pour with a rocky white head. Nose is meringue, dried manure, pasture and general countryside. Pepper. Nice brett character evident. Flavor is quite dry moderately bitter. Strong brett and peppered grass dominate. Mild grapefruit. Medium body, strong carbonation. Smells great but the flavor is a little one-dimensional.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
959,"2016-07-09",4.3,"Bottle. Hazy golden amber color, fluffy white head with good retention and solid lacing. Aroma of barn corners, attics, and animals sweating in the distance. Taste is funky, dusty, peppery tannins. Delicious.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
959,"2016-07-08",4.0,"33cl bottle. Hazy orange with huge white head. The beer has very fresh aromas of fruits like white grapes, apples, some gooseberry, banana. There are also some notes of hay and barnyard in the background. Also white cheese, pepper, clove and cake. Fluffy and soft mouth feel with medium carbonation. The beer is again refreshing with sweet cake notes and some spices, then the bitterness is strong but doesnt last too long to make it unpleasant. The finish is somehow medium long and fruity. A very complex beer yet very refreshing with delicious spicy cake malt background. I could drink that everyday.","Warszawa, POLAND","Swaroga"
