1494,"2017-04-23",4.0,"22 oz bottle. Pours a very dark brown almost black in color and crowned by a small layer of tan colored foam that settles in nicely to a thin film and leaves streaks of lace around the glass. The aroma is nice showing notes of smooth dark chocolate, orange zest, bourbon, toasted caramel, lactose, and oak laden vanilla. There is a just a touch of roast in there to try and balance things out. The flavor follows suit with the dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and a huge wave of juicy orange to go with soft oaky bourbon, vanilla, and some light earthy bitterness on the back end that tries to keep the sweetness in check. Nearly full bodied and slick on the palate with soft carbonation that leads to a lengthy dark chocolate and orange finish that lingers for awhile. Im not big on the chocolate orange candy, but this is pretty tasty stuff. The adjuncts feel a little artificial for sure, but either way it is a solid beer. The barrel aging adds another level without going overboard. Really enjoyed this one.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
