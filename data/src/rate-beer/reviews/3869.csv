3869,"2017-05-02",3.1,"From a can, poured a ligbtly hazy dark gold. Aroma was of light citrusy hops, pale malt, grape soda. Flavor similar, hops subdued, grapde soda for dags, not good.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
3869,"2017-04-21",3.8,"12oz can thanks to Steve. Pours out a hazy golden topped with a white head. Nose is nice tropical fruits citrus orange juice and leafy hops. Taste is more of the nice tropical fruits citrus juice.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
3869,"2017-04-21",3.7,"Poured from a 12 oz can. 
Aroma is hop forward with quite a bit of mandarin, tangerine and orange. Some lighter grapefruit notes with light pine resin. Medium light malt notes with hints of caramel and toasted bread. 
Pours a somewhat hazy, golden orange with a medium sized, thick, white head that recedes to a thin film that lingers. Moderate lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is somewhat sweet with moderately strong malt notes. Some cracker malt notes but also quite a bit of caramel and toasted bread. Medium high bitterness with a moderate hop flavor. Hop flavor is dominated by orange and tangerine with some light pine resin. Some lingering hop oil and resin notes. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a decent beer, but I dont understand the hype. Its pretty malt forward and the hop profile lacks a wow factor.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3869,"2017-03-23",4.3,"As a proud recipient of a day-old can of the Fuzzy Baby Ducks IPA, I can definitively say that, as depicted on the can itself, I feel as if there are rainbow shooting out of my butt. Not only is the name adorable and the can packaging hilarious, but its a pretty damn good beer too. Pours cloudy and golden, with an aroma that is very clearly hoppy, with some orange and zestyness to it. The taste is hop-bitter and smooth, with a nice fruity finish. Highly recommended to share with your sweet one after a long day, fresh out of the can, like a baby duck coming out of its shell and into this beautiful world.","New Haven, Connecticut, USA","meccahh69lol"

3869,"2016-07-20",4.0,"Tap at haymaker. Lovely orangy yellow small head. Nose is bursting with citrus and pine. Tastes of pineapple, mango, pine, resin. Soft an delightful fluffy mouthfeel. Not mind blowing but very solid and could drink all the time","New York, USA","Jow"
3869,"2016-07-07",4.0,"Growler. Finally! Been hunting this guy for a while. Nose is citra hop forward. A mix of light dank with tropical fruit, mango notes. Lightly hazy gold with a large white head. Light melon as it warms. Taste is initially bitter followed by a light malt sweetness, then a quenching hop flavor. Light orange flavor, with much mango and papaya. Pretty damn good!","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
3869,"2016-03-13",3.9,"Growler shared by Bill, 2 weeks old. Hazy golden color with small to medium white head. Aromas and flavor are somewhat close to boat beer which makes me happy but it was more muddled and didnt have nearly the amount of clean, bitter, lemon juice yo. Notes of peach, nectarine, bitter and lightly ashy hop, grain, and other citra dank tones.. Body is very light and refreshing. Solid but wish I had it when it was a few days old.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3869,"2016-03-06",3.8,"Poured from a growler I got from Eddie. The man is a damn god. The pour is a darker orange, bits of clear gold shining through with a decent white head and some solid lace on the glass. This is going to be awesome. The aroma is a blast of Citra hops up front. There is a lovely leafy hop to go with the juiciness and a lovely pine bitterness on the back end. There is a ton of hop and a bittering pine resin. It's well balanced. The flavor is interesting. There is a lot more leafy hop on the front end, and the juiciness fades. The pine and bitter resin are also relaxed as it moves over the tongue. It's got a bit of maltiness on the back end that I don't necessarily care for. The mouth feel is light and crisp and the carbonation is a little off. It's light. The aftertaste is lingeringly butter zest on the finish. This is a damn good IPA, but I was hoping for a little more from a NE Citra beauty.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3869,"2016-03-06",3.8,"Growler shared with koleminer20, my god. Aroma is wonderful, tropical fruit, pine, dank, juicy, citrus, wonderful. Assurance Appearance is amber golden, white head, slight haze. Taste is pine, some tropical fruit, bitter, orange peel slight malt, pretty good. Mouthfeel is light to medium body, light carbonation, bitter hop aftertaste. Overall, solid but I was expecting this to be better.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
3869,"2016-03-02",4.4,"Growler fom Brewery: This one pours a hazy golden color. It had a small head and left no lacing. It has a nice nose. Citrus, mango, pineapple. The taste is excellent. Good hop bite and balanced. Citrus, pineapple, mango. As good as advertised!","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
3869,"2016-01-10",4.5,"Pours a pale yellow color with a big, stable head.

Offers a great, flowery lemon aroma on the nose, creating an enjoyable fruitiness from the get go. While there is not so much going on apart from the profound lemon, its multi layered richness actually convinces on its own. Truly refreshing, with a range between juicy to being crisp - very intriguing.

Has a medium, soft mouthfeel, showcasing the beers pungent citrus greatness in a very mellowed, enjoyable fashion, while revealing enough hop oomph at the same time.

Offers a citrus crispness right from the beginning, soothed by crackery malts and a fluffy aqueous quality. The malts turn a tad sweeter right before the swallow, which is neccessary to balance the fast evolving citraic bitterness, which remains utmost silk on the palate. Finishes clean and soft, with a dry, citrus fruitiness cutting through, establishing a juicy, long lasting aftertaste.

Loved this, while I find it hard to describe, as this beer is entirely focussed on its citrus hoppiness, and that is said within few words. It is perfectly put together though, especially due to its smooth mouthfeel, equiping the citrus with a softness you wouldnt be able to get from biting into an actual citrus fruit, while everything else is there. A flowery quality adds to the complexity of the citrus, keeping it interesting on the palate, while preventing it from overpowering the palate by scaling up too much lime bitterness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3869,"2015-03-05",4.6,"Pours the same color as my rubber ducky at home. Good lacing and moderate head retention. Super floral. Get it when you can. It's a must.","Hamden, Connecticut, USA","boofcheese"
3869,"2015-03-03",4.1,"Pours hazy, barely translucent apricot with a thin ivory head. Fruity aroma has a sharp evergreen hoppy overtone. Flavor is quite hoppy and woody but only a little bitter, with a fruity underpinning. Firm, smooth texture has some good fizz and leaves a woody hop finish.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
3869,"2015-03-02",4.4,"HMOG 2015. Growler pour. Single greatest IPA I have ever had. Just amazing. Tropical and citrus in a huge way. Nicely sweet, juicy, more tropical. The nose is crazy and the taste delivers on that. Wow.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"
3869,"2015-03-02",4.5,"One I never thought Id see so thanks to mateoloco. World class especially for a straight IPA. The aroma wafts from the glass. You can smell this 3 feet away. Big tropical fruit again. The flavor is way aggressive and big hops, citrus, grapefruit. Just an amazing drink.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
3869,"2015-02-26",4.4,"4500th rating, growler thanks to Rob! Pours a cloudy orange with small off white head. The aroma is tropical fruit, citrus, and pine. Medium mouth, sticky wet hop, tropical fruit, nice citra, juicy, resin finish, really impressive.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3869,"2014-12-08",3.4,"Bottle... Pours hazy and golden with a small, creamy, white head. Good retention. The aroma is big, musky and dank, boasting over-the-top Citra hop character and a light, biscuity component. Medium-bodied with airy carbonation. The flavor furnishes heaps of citrusy, tannic, rindy bitterness. Finishes bitter, raspy and a touch dry. The bitterness really lingers on the palate, fallowed by grapefruit burps. Bottle courtesy of ctipping!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3869,"2014-12-03",4.1,"Draft. Pours gold white head. Nose/taste of pine. lemon, grapefruit peel, cracker malt, citrus rind. Medium body.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
3869,"2014-12-03",4.1,"Growler pour. Hazy golden pour with white head. Xitrus forward, some pine and earthy aromas. Flavors are similar, fresh citrus and pine flavors.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
3869,"2014-01-13",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Engaging aromatics are echoed in this IPAs flavour profile, leaving the palate awash in citrus fruit, resins and hemp-like depths.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the cloudy yellow.
-This is not bracingly bitter, for once.
-Drinkability is rather high for the style.
-The chosen hop profile and mouthfeel harken Heady Topper somewhat.

3869,"2014-01-02",4.3,"Growler: muddled, burnt orange & amber-ish body, completely opaque & topped with a nice, foamy, eggshell colored head that settles to a thin skin across the top of the brew. Aroma is a dripping Citra hop blast; notes of pineapple, mango, peach, tangerine... Very grassy with some pines, wet hop oils, & a mild green onion-y note. Fantastic nose. Taste has a nice, big bitter bite up front. Pine & fresh cut grass slice the palate with a big bitterness, fading into the more citric & tropical side in the finish... Pineapple, grapefruit, guava-like tropical notes, perhaps some mango in the periphery. Small malt presence, maybe just a touch of crackers but this is a super dry IPA. Bottom line: grassy, bitter, citric, & lightly tropical. One of the best single IPAs Ive had.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
3869,"2013-12-29",4.6,"Growler from nebcos new location opening. Pours hazy golden. Aroma is very citrusy and tropical. Taste is juicy, citrus, hoppy awesomeness. So easy to drink with a light hop bitterness at the end. I regret leaving 2 liters behind.","","Quag"

3869,"2013-12-29",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2014 32oz growler in a tulip. Pours hazy golden with a white head. Aroma of citrusy hops, tropical fruit, pale and light caramel malts. Flavor so strong of citrusy and fruity hops with light malts to balance it perfectly. Average texture. A really good IPA. Edit: on tap in a glass.  Aroma sooo strong of citrusy hops and tropical fruit.  What a great IPA.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
3869,"2013-12-24",4.5,"Growler from the source poured into tulip: pours golden orange with a thin white head. Aroma of grapefruit, floral... Lots of citrus. Taste is unreal, grapefruit, wave after wave of hoppy flavor but well balanced with the malt. So juicy. Very clean finish with lots of flavor, slightly oily mouthfeel, no bitterness at the end at all. This is amazing. Plus on for the name.","Willington, Connecticut, USA","bellco33"
3869,"2013-12-24",4.5,"A soft, hazy golden orange; thin white head. Initial hay and floral aroma opens up to sweet tropical fruits: orange, mango, peach, and grapefruit. Extremely mild blend of sweet and bitter taste. Smooth and almost creamy from the gentle carbonation. Light residual hop bitterness in the finish.","California, USA","Ataraxia"
3869,"2013-12-24",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 26, 2013 10 liters of delicious duck joose. Aroma is citra hops to the extreme. Heavy tropical fruit, scallion, citrus, and grass. Taste is dry with light cracker malts and heavy citrus fruit salad. Really juicy and dry with a nice bittering punch at the end. Nebco killed it.  Right up there with Susan and Lunch as my favorite IPA.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
3869,"2013-03-05",4.2,"Finally! Draft pour has a yellow amber color with a big chewy white head. Lighting sucks in here so color is best I can do. Aroma has huge dry citrus rind, resins, tropics, pineapple, and a light flowery sweetness. Mouth feel is medium light with good carbonation. Flavor continues on the citrus rind thrashing, light bitterness, resins, tropics, and a clean hit of malt underlying. So easy to drink with no noted alcohol. Wow","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"
3869,"2013-02-03",3.5,"Smoothed over hops, full of Citra bliss. Creamy body, malty, a touch of sweetness, crisp, delicious. Doesn't capture me like my favorite Single IPAs do, but even the fact that I like this says a lot, considering my dislike of the style.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"
3869,"2013-02-02",4.6,"Growler filled 2/1/2013 at NEBCO. 

There wasnt too bad of a line when I got there. It was worth my travels. FBD is another great IPA from NEBCO. I heard this was brewed with a good amount of citra which is evident in the nose and taste. A very good beer. 64 oz wasnt enough,","Hartford, Connecticut, USA","youNyte"
3869,"2012-07-11",4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy amber with a white head.  Smells of grapefruit, melon, lemony, juicyfruit.  Tastes crisp and bitter with a nice amount of citrus.  Excellent balance.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
3869,"2012-06-30",4.4,"On tap at The Winchester, right across the street from NEBCO. Standard pour into a pint glass. Review coming from some notes I took on my phone...hey, ticks a tick!

A - Bright orange hazy body. Small off white head. Not super impressive. 

S - Strong citra presence. Orange juice, tropical fruit, grapefruit, lemon and some lightly dank onion. Super juicy fruits with a touch of bready malts. 

T - The fruit is all over the place. Grapefruit, pineapple, lemons and limes, papaya, etc. Theres a bit of a grassy and danky onion presence. This is all smoothed out on the finish by some biscuity malt. Finishes dry and bitter with lasting citrus juice flavors. Really refreshing with tons of citrus hop flavors, drinks way too easily. Medium mouth feel. 

O - I missed my chance of getting a growler of this, so I was stoked to get to try this on tap. Amazing beer that really highlights the citra hop variety. I hope this gets brewed again next year!","Connecticut, USA","davey101"
