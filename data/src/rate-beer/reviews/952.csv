952,"2017-01-08",3.2,"(swing top bottle) Hazy, pale golden colour with a blond mid-sized foamy head. Fruity and piney, also slightly grassy hoppy aroma with notes of grapefruit, peaches and pears, mildly pale malty background with hints of yeasty spice. Mildly bitter-sweet flavour, light to medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Dry and a tad slim malty base with present, mainly fruity and slightly piney hops, getting slightly grassy as well towards the bitter-sweet and dry finish. Nice and uncomplicated brew, rather suited for the summer time. 08.I.17","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
952,"2016-12-17",2.7,"0,5 l bottle from a local bottle shop. Pale golden and unclear in the glass. One finger off white but fast fading head. Dry hopy grapefruity on the nose.

952,"2016-12-07",3.6,"Half litre flip top, poured into oversized Triple Karmliet tulip. A: Golden colour, very hazy, large rocky head. S: Citrus hops, hints of grapefruit and mangoes. T: Combined bittersweet tangerine with real hit of sharpness, lingering bitter finish. M: Smooth in but sharp out, low carbonation, medium body. O: Very much like an American Pale Ale, I dont know how much it resembled a traditional California Common as its a style Im unfamiliar with.","Greater London, ENGLAND","Jonb5"
952,"2016-12-04",3.3,"Pours a clear golden color. Aroma is grainy and grass. Taste is light grass, and fruit notes. Very light and easy drinking. OK beer.","Baden-Baden, GERMANY","kevnic2008"
952,"2016-10-27",3.4,"0.5 l bottle from local Dursty, best before December 2017. Clear, golden yellow with a medium large, rather dense, stable, white head. Grassy, floral and slightly fruity aroma of fresh grass, citrus and a touch of white grapes. Fruity-grassy, floral, slightly bitter and quite dry taste of fresh grass, grapefruit, lemon peel and some white grapes, followed by a short, crisp, slightly bitter, grassy and rather dry finish. Thin to medium body, smooth and rather effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Very refreshing and quaffable, would have been smarter to release this during the summer rather than autumn. I also still dont really know how this style should be like, all the examples Ive tried so far had only little in common. This is not that close to Anchor Steam Beer by the way.","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"
