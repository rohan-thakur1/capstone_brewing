Lovely buttered ryebread aroma. Taste similar. Palate light. Slightly sour buttery palate - bread-pudding kind of butteriness. Freaking delish. Finish is a bit dry, but makes you want to drink more. Alcohol pretty well covered. Kinda 1-dimensional, but utterly gorgeous. OK, the non-BA was good, but this is even better!","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
