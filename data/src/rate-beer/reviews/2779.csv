2779,"2013-03-15",3.4,"On tap U Vsech Certu (04/03/13). Hazy dark gold/amber pour with creamy white head. Aroma of well done toast, a strong yeast charachter is present in the aroma, fruity esters are just reminiscent enough of alcohol. Roasty flavor, light yeastiness, fruity body, hops remain to be found, slightly mineral on the finish. Palate is rich and creamy yet very easy drinking. Not a remarkable example but a highly drinkable beer.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2779,"2013-03-11",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
This velvety Polotmava shares lots of yeasty aromas atop herbal hops and caramel malts.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A super creamy, thick head of foam covers the cloudy dark amber.
-This might not be a refined example, but it is comfy and flavorful.
-Light fruitiness is found. With the yeasty touch, it points towards short lagering...
-Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy. As if a touch of nitrogen was used to carbonate the beer...

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

Poured a amber-orange, slightly brownish colour with no head when I got to it.  Eggy and barnyardy aroma. The taste was better than expected.
