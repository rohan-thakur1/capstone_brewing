2792,"2014-12-31",4.3,"0,4l draught. Classical half-brown beer with rocky head what doesnt disappear. Taste is quite simple, nice sweet malt, smoky (earthy) hop, and a lot of caramel thanks to the caramel malt. CO2 is ligh (it is OK for me)t, but foam is very right - i dont understand. :)","Szeged, HUNGARY","dr.dod"

2792,"2013-03-14",2.3,"On tap at the brewpub (04/03/13). Clear dark gold pour topped by a thin white head. Aroma is really booze froward, pretty aggressive and aggravating, estery, pineapple-booze, not particularly inviting. Grainy as in grain alcohol flavour, pineapple, really fruity, a tad cloying. Palate is well carbed that manages to cut through some of the sweetness, but it is still quite unpleasant.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2792,"2013-03-11",2.9,"My Bottom Line:
Floral hops and svelte caramel malts lean on alcohol and wooden hop bitterness in this storyless, unpolished lager.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the misty amber.
-Carbonation was soft and the body slender, which normally would have helped drinkability.
-Fruity edges are found.
-Another disappointing offering from Pegas. Tastes like this brewery is on auto-pilot, living off of tourists and business people staying at the hotel. There are many better places in Brno...

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
