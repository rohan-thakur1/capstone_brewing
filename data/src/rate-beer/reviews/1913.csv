1913,"2017-02-08",3.5,"Rating #2429 - 2016.04.11 - Draught @alibiroom - Copper&Theory TT - Clear amber pour with a moderate white head, medium retention. Aroma is sweet, soft fruits, sweetgrass. Taste is mild citrus, mild grass, mild earthy note. Smooth, medium bodied, and satisfying.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","bulldogops"
1913,"2017-02-03",3.2,"Rich hazy copper and bronze coloured body with a very muddied brown glow. Aroma of rich toasted malt, tons of caramel, earth, piney and earthy hops, apples and a bit of yeast still around. Medium-bodied; Strong earthy hop bitterness noticeable at first, but not pungent nor assertive - along with a lot of caramelised sugars, grain, toffee, a touch of the alcohol is still noticeable and ending with a dry and grassy flavour. Aftertaste is relatively simple with the toasted malt and earthy hops only noticeable - not too pungent or bitter, but showing the caramelised sugars for sure. Overall, a decent beer, but nothing extremely good nor one of the better EPAs Ive had either. Worth trying if you like the style and can find it easily. I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Liqour Outlet in Boonton, New Jersey on 22-July-2016 for US$4,58 sampled at home in Washington on 02-February-2017 instead of flying back home with it from Oregon!","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

1913,"2016-07-02",3.9,"This was poured into a nonic.
The appearance was a semi-dark hazy burnt orange almost brown color with a slim fingers worth of white foamy head that quickly dissipated. Some light rings of lace slightly cling nicely.
The smell starts off with a sweet bready malt roaming into subtle sweet to bitter grassy malt. Subtle ""biting"" spice as it warms. Light herbal. Super subtle earth. Estery pomme-like fruit. Honey-like biscuits.
The taste started off sweet with the bready malts blending into the grassy hops.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light.
Overall, definitely an English pale ale by all means, and a cleaned up one as well. Would definitely love to have again with some fish nchips.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

$4.99
Beer #38 in the series.
Amber coloured ale with an attractive creamy thick creme coloured head
Definitely English hops in the aroma..leafy ,like tobacco even.., hazelnuts..and a small amount of floral hop.
A supremely balanced beer in taste...the thick malts are not dominated by the hops..sweet yet easy. English style..
Very smooth and creamy mouth feel but broken up by drying hop bitterness..adds drinkability.
A great beer..another winner from Gigantic","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
