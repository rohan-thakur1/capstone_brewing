Caramel, malty, cookies, rum, dried fruit, some coffee notes, quite sweet. Medium to full bodied. Warming, but alcohol is not too offensive. Good stuff.","CROATIA","Iznogud"
4472,"2016-06-09",3.3,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2016 Jan. 16. A 0.25 l bottle from 100 piv, Bratislava. It poured light hazy brown body with a tiny head. Lightly sweet, medicinal, woody, rubber and harsh caramel aroma. Flavor was sweet and quite alcoholic, too. Hay, grain, caramel, some honey... A bit messed up all in all. Medium to full body with oily palate and long, sweet and alcoholic finish. I wouldnt guess its close to 17% though. Not bad, but, as stated, messed up without its dominant direction.","Split, CROATIA","heavy"

4472,"2016-03-03",3.3,"Fľaa 250 ml z 1. pivotéky v Nitre. Tmavá takmer hnedá farba, s niou penou, sladkastá aróma. Plná sladká, sladová chuť s jemne alkoholovým pozadím. Ťako hodnotiť niečo tak peciálne, čo som okotoval prvý krát. Investované eurá neľutujem, pili sme to traja z poldecákov ako aperitív... :-D","Nitra, SLOVAK REPUBLIC","Vincent68"

4472,"2016-02-13",3.9,"First bottle tasted from trade, thanks Coldbrewky! Might not have been the best choice for the 1st of a long tasting, but here we go. Poured from the bottle. Dark and syrup in the glass with little head to speak of. Big dark cherry and raisins across a boozy warm pallet. Syrupy sweet and super complex. Wow!","New York, USA","ByTheirLimpin"
4472,"2016-02-04",3.0,"Sampled from bottle @ ""Het is allemaal de schuld van Koen"" tasting. Hazy reddish color, average sized off-white head. Aroma is lightly malts, a bit weird sort of sugary, brown sugar wet leaves and raisins aroma in there. Taste malts, sugar, sweet, brown sugar, sweet alcoholic finish as well. Not my thing I guess.","Oirschot, THE NETHERLANDS, NETHERLANDS","Benzai"
4472,"2016-01-28",4.2,"After running around this morning and stocking up on grub for the tasting that evening, We decided that the first of the day should be the smallest bottle. Unpasteurized and unfiltered, this critter pours a murky brown with a thin, nearly still head. Boozy nose, ripe fruit, an instant of anaerobic tone that morphed into a sweet malt tone. Reminiscent of a SamAdams triple bock. Rasin finish. Wow. Bottle supplied by evil Cuso.","Hippetown East, New York, USA","coldbrewky"

4472,"2016-01-13",4.1,"250 ml 2015 vintage bottle, acquired by Werckmeister for me, thanks!
Dark copper-brown body, with a small, dissipating, frothy, beige head.
Aroma of dried fruits, caramel, milk chocolate, dark berries, some cherries, booze.
Taste is pretty boozy, with dried fruits, caramel, cocoa, tobacco, sweet berries, some wooden dryness, subtle floral hops.
Medium, oily mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation.
Finishes boozy, astringent, warming, pretty dry, medium sweet, with cocoa, wood, tobacco, some milk chocolate, subtle fruits, subtle hop bitterness.

Really tasty! Pretty much on par (if not better) with my favourite Eisbock from Schneider Weisse, while this is rather different, more like a big Barley Wine. Lots of sweet layers, balanced by a pleasant, woody dryness, that takes over in the finish. The only ""flaw"" for me is the strong boozyness, but then this is expectable because of the high ABV. Overall really big, complex stuff, outstanding style example!","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"
4472,"2015-12-28",1.7,"Bottle. Pours in dark red-black body with low to none bubbly head. A lot of sediment in the bottle. Aroma has vegetable character, alcoholic. Taste is full of yeast, light fruity. Maybe a infected or wrong bottle but should not happen with 8 eur beer, very disappointed.","CZECH REPUBLIC","mmahut"

4472,"2015-04-21",4.5,"Tapped at the ""Salon Piva"" craft beer festival in April 2015 in Bratislava/Slovakia. This was a really nice surprise by the brewery. A 36° plato beer. The nose piercing aroma of amazing dried plums and sweet malt/milk chocolate pudding blew me away! Brown copper red color, tan good head. Taste continued in the same way with dried fruits mainly plums, sweet dried figs and milk chocolate. Surprisingly the alcohol was minimal and very good covered by the beers main characteristics. Bravo!","SLOVAK REPUBLIC","Karol"
4472,"2015-04-18",4.2,"Tap at Salon piva. Very nice strong beer, seemed like a barley wine, lots of malty complexity, dried fruits, caramel and so on. But what striked me most was the balanced. Malty sweetness was on top, but balanced by a bitter backbone. Very nice beer.","Bratislava, SLOVAK REPUBLIC","Gurthnar"
