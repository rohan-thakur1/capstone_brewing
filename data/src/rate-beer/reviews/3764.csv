3764,"2015-01-14",3.4,"12 oz. bottle from 2011 Beer Camp mix pack that had just arrived at retailer. Served in a pint glass. [from notes].

A: The beer pours a hazed golden orange color with a super creamy and very high bone-colored head. Head has excellent retention and more than 2 pours were required to get this in my glass. {A 2nd bottle only produced a modest but durable white head} Cloudy, unfiltered look. Limited lacing.

S: Yeasty and wheaty with clove, citrus and banana tones. Perhaps not bad for style but not to my taste.

T: Low levels of bitter, sweet and sour largely in balance, but with a sweet start and a sour finish. Hints of citrus under clove, banana, and light malt. Well done but not really my cup of tea. 

M: medium/thin body; low but fine carbonation; after a bit of crispness initially it is quite soft

O: My first beer from the Beer Camp. Given my love for Sierra Nevada Brewing, this one was a little disappointing but ... Not a favorite style, but clearly a step above average for style IMO.

3764,"2013-12-12",3.0,"4/4 for the pack. Bottled in early April.

A: Pours a hazy apricotesque ale with a single finger of light caramel head. This falls quickly to a sheet of the same. Some spotty lacing.

S: The wheat is king in this nose. Plenty of sweet wheat notes with bready, biscuity malt in the back. Some nice floral notes. The yeast is pretty traditional for the style - earthy, a little sharp, hints of clove. Oddly, the alcohol comes through on this one for me, not good.

T: A little overly yeasty on the palate. The wheat is fun, but adds a little too much sweetness. Some banana. The beer has all the basic parts to make up a nice weizenbock, but they just dont weave quite too well. They seem to all be in combat with one another, rather than weaving properly.

M: Thick with high carb. Long, sweet, wet finish.

O: As above, this has all the pieces, but the puzzle isnt quite finished here. If they took another crack at this, I would give it another go, but as it stands, not quite on the level I would expect for Sierra.

3764,"2012-12-05",3.4,"August 19th, 2011 -  Sierra Nevadas Weizenbock must have graduated from beer camp with flying colors, because it now appears to stand on its own on market shelves, proud and decorated. I remember it being an tasty, toothsome beer a year and a half ago, with its skillfully crafted emphasis on light, fruit flavors. Marmalade orange in color with a finger of a white-tan head, this looks like so many other summer beers I quaffed back in 2011. The smell sets it apart, with a dry aroma based on the weizenbocks particular grain composition, but also limned with juicy and acidic apricot. Fresh orange juice makes an appearance too, making this beer smell like a part of a well rounded breakfast. The flavor matches the aroma - a pleasant, fruity acidity like unripe apricots, a sharp and cutting palate (again, always good for cutting through summers dry mouth) and a long aftertaste that almost seems to ripen the fruits flavor the longer it lasts. Im not Sierra Nevadas head brewer (Pfff, I wish) but I can see why he made the decision to keep going with this alumnus of their Beer Camp.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
3764,"2012-11-10",3.3,"I am not a big weizenbock drinker so maybe I was not ready for this but I have never had one that was so damn yeasty. Dark and turbid orange color.

3764,"2012-02-01",3.2,"In short: A pale weizenbock with the usual stuff.  Average
How:  Bottle 12oz, part of the 2011 Beer Camp Mix Pack.  Consumed approximately 4  months after it hit the stores.
The look: Cloudy glowing orange-blond body topped by a small white head
In long: Nose of sunburnt hay, a bit of bubblegum, light note of cloves.  Taste is wheaty, hay, bananas, bubblegum, sweet apricots, some cloves, yeast, phenols, sweet fruity juice from canned fruits.  A bit sweet.  Almost no hops presence.  Im not a big fan of weizenbock, and this one was just very average for the paler weizenbock sub-style.  One of lowest rated Sierra Nevada rating, a bit disappointing.

Not that great really, so either Ive got a bottle that has passed its prime, or these ratings are overinflated. I want softer mouthfeel with more spice and more yeast character. This came off as overly acidic with hard carbonation and little character. It was drinkable and okay, but nowhere near the caliber of its standing in the ratings.

3764,"2011-08-11",3.8,"Sampled at 1702, Tucson; August 2011
Arrives from the tap with a pale tan colored head that is about a half-finger in height.  The beer is a hazy, pale amber color that shows a really murky hue when held up to the light.  The beer smells of toothsome crushed pale wheat, a touch of green apples, clove, a touch of earthy grain character, some dried hay like notes and a general fruitiness that perhaps has a touch of banana to it.

Smooth feeling and somewhat thick as it hits the palate, there is a touch of a carbonic prickle from the carbonation and the finish has a big note of banana and then clove.  Chewy pale wheat malt notes, a touch of hay like grain, and some starchy honey sweetness.  There is a touch of yeasty (meaning the flavor of actual suspended yeast)flavors to this beer, but not as much as the deep haze might suggest, and it actually seems to get wrapped up in the chewy grain character that so defines this beer.  The Phenolic character in the finish has a hint of plastic character to it at times, though this is quite subtle.  I definitely like the chewy texture of this beer, it is perhaps not quite as toothsome as one might expect in a Weizenbock, but it is exactly what I like to find when I am in the mood for a chewy Hefeweizen.  There is also a hint of tartness to the finish that keeps this fairly quaffable.

This really seems more like a chewy HefeWeizen than I Weizenbock (this is lower in alcohol than New Glarus regular Hefe); I find that the pale Weizenbocks really need to be beefed up substantially before they can differentiate themselves from regular strength Hefes.  Still this is definitely quite a tasty beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Color hits between a creamsicle and burnt orange with thick haze. Nose has bourbon, grass, and hops. Initially the high carbonation dominates the mouth, then it switches to a hard hop bite, and finally fades into something resembling peanut brittle. Excellent, complex brew.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","DukeBrewDevil"

3764,"2011-07-05",4.0,"Pours a soft bronze color with a massive billowing head. Certainly looks like a real German weizenbock. Big sticky lacing and good retention. Aroma is pleasant and sweet, with the classic banana oil note and a snickerdoodle maltiness. Lesser notes of grains and a very mild citric acidity. Flavor is quite silky and luscious. Nilla wafers and ripe bananas, less clove influence than Id expect. Theres a different spiciness in the finish, or maybe its more grassiness, which must be a noble hop accent. Honeyed grains sometimes come through, depending on the sip. Second pour yields more citrus and yeast flavors. Palate is quite nice; the body is perfect but the carbonation is a touch high. As it warms and breathes it settles into a very good beer. Considering this and Kellerweis, you have to put SN in the conversation of best American brewer of German styles.

Pours a very hazy dark golden orange color with golden banana yellow edges when held to a light and a 1.5 finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a lasting cap. Rings and spots of soapy lacing left behind.

Sweet citrus fruit aroma with a ton of bready yeast and banana character as well as some zesty spice and earthy, floral hops. Hints of pepper, clove, and citrus rind. Subtle alcohol as well but the yeast dominates the nose.

Full bodied with a nice balance of bready yeast, sweet citrus fruit, banana and zesty spice. The yeast and banana characteristics are very prominent adding fullness to the body and balancing the spicier and sweeter fruit notes. Hints of zesty pepper and clove up front that linger into a slightly dry finish. Orange peel and lemon zest add sweetness and balance. Complex and full boded yet remains very flavorful and easy to drink. The best beer of the series that Ive tried so far. Recommended!","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Appearance: Pours out a clouded, grubby orange body with an initially lofty, white head.

Smell: Tangy and tart aroma of not-quite-fully-baked yeasty wheat loaf, clover honey, cloves, and dried lemon. Though, as it warms, a quality of cloves soaked in a clean, quality spirit begins to dominate.

Taste: Sweet honey suspectly dosed with a pinch more turbinado glazed over bready malted wheat preclude the expected elements of banana puddin, ground cloves, and a garnish-worthy lemon wedge. Small snippet of yeasty dough and Dubble Bubble. The unapologetically growing clove spiciness mingles with some slight tartness and a bit of alcoholic warmth. Slice of farm-fresh apple. Low bitterness. Tangy, semi-sweet, and creamy on the finish with a little lingering warmth.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a murky, light to medium, brownish orange with a hube, off-white head that mostly diminished and left good lacing. The aroma had light wheat and bread; heavy spicy and clove yeast; a little banana; and citrus fruits. The initial flavor was somewhat sweet and lightly acidic; while the finish was light to moderately sweet, moderate to rather acidic and lightly bitter. There was sweet malt, honey, white bread, fresh-baked bread, citrus fruits, clove, spices, yeast, wheat and hints of cocoa. The slightly more than medium body was sort of creamy and a little sticky on the lips with soft carbonation and a lightly astringent finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Hazy pale orange pour, with a nice fluffy head (abundant mouthfeel is a treat too). Nose is fruity and estery, but not too much so. Theres a raw, earthy quality to it that makes the aroma more appealing than some others in this style. Flavors are bright, not cloying, and are well balanced overall.

Aroma of wheat and alcohol, and a moderate dose of banana bread. Soft palate, delicious banana bread flavor. Like Sierras Kellerweis, minus the clove, plus a bit more body and punch. Kellerweis is more drinkable, though, and this suffers from the possible defect of being to hot (read: boozy). Other than that, this is a very nice beer.","California, USA","cmc619"
3764,"2011-06-18",3.3,"Thanks to BA abru17 for hooking me up with this bottle -cheers buddy!
Poured chilled from the short 12oz into a Duvel tulip.

A nice hazed amber like honey with thick cap of cream that settles to about a 1/2 inch with a microbead. The aroma is very full of banana esters and seems like a weizen in general with some light clove and mild alcohol odors, but very bready scent with yeast aroma the dominant smell. There is perhaps a tinge of hops in the background but very mild. The feel is good but a little sweet with full body and mild carbonation and gentle spice with a semi dry and light heat in the finish.

The taste of Beer Camp Weizenbock is lightly fruity to start- not as much banana in the flavor as the aroma and more creaminess than spice, but slight tanginess of yeast comes in with gentle pepper in the tail end. The light toasted and ripe banana leads to a slight flavor of alcohol and caramel as it finishes with a moderately sweet malt and yeast synergy. I like how creamy it seems with each sip letting you know you are getting your moneys worth in wheat and yeast. I enjoyed this particular beer and was satisfied with the Sierra Nevada attempt, but there are much better examples of the style out there. I just feel it is missing something...perhaps complexity","York, Pennsylvania, USA","Slatetank"

3764,"2011-06-17",3.7,"Bottle picked up at State Line in Elkton. Served in a Hill Farmstead long-stem tulip.

Pours a slightly-cloudy dark yellow color with a thin white head. Short retention time and not much lacing to speak of. Good thin cap throughout. The nose brings some nice banana and clove and a bit of bready malt in the background. The flavor mixes the yeast and malt quite well, with a nice clove spice to go with mild fruit and a bit of bread. Medium body with low carbonation; incredibly smooth and drinkable. No noticeable alcohol. Really a well done brew that is at the top of its style.

Aroma: The nose is made up of wheat, lemon, sugar, banana, spice, and other fruity notes

Appearance: It pours into the glass a bright golden-orange color with a small white head

Flavor: The taste is rather sweet lots banana and citrus, spice/wheat there, but more subtle

Palate: It has a fairly clean feel, it is pretty full bodied, and it leaves a sugary stickiness on the mouth

Overall Impression: 
This one is a fairly solid Weizenbock.  It leans toward the sweet side for sure, and is a little too sugary for my tastes, but it isnt bad.  I still enjoyed drinking this one, and found it to be well made.  It is certainly not light on flavor or substance, which is a positive for sure.

The creamy, juicy texture is the nicest thing about this beer, pretty much spot on,  but Im not going to complain about the gently spicy aroma or the big banana flavor either. I dont think this is a perfect beer by any means, one specific weak point being a lack of vibrant fruitiness in the nose, but it does show one element that I feel separates the great brewers from the ones that are merely good: special attention to texture. There is something about the way this beer handles itself going down that just makes you want to drink more.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

The taste is semisweet, with the normal culprits in bananas and clove, yet with a gooey honey thickness that fattens up the back end before it drifts into a mild dry finish.

Yeasty, sweet aroma with some molasses notes and some baked bread goodness. Flavor is on the sweet side but not cloying. Pick up some caramel notes, cloves, molasses and some fresh baked bread. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Very decent.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
3764,"2011-05-14",4.0,"(bottle)  Pours a muddy dark gold/yellow with a medium white head that retains and leaves moderate lacing.  Aroma is full of bubblegum, banana, wheat, and clove.  This really turns into a bubblegum bomb with further warming, and that certainly isnt a bad thing.  All the standard aromas are here, and for me thats all that needs to be here, as I really enjoy all of these aromatic components.  From time to time, however, there is an off scent I detect, and it appears to be methane, so I must deduct a point from the aroma.  Flavor has a stronger caramel undertone paired with ripe banana, and yields a bananas foster flavor, which again is standard and very good.  The wheat and bubblegum flavors sweep in on the finish and the wheat (with some clove perhaps) does a good job of cleaning up the sweetness.  Alcohol is not present.  Mouthfeel is medium, somewhat chalky on the finish, and the carbonation is very lively.  Overall this is a pretty good weizenbock, and I will admit that my rating is undoubtedly inflated due to my affinity for the style itself.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
