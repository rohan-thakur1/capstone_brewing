1404,"2016-11-29",3.6,"0,75 flaske (5,4%, ikke 5,5) delt på RBHD-treff hos Odd Gunnar nov-16: brunsvart med mørkt rødlig skjær. Tet og højt skum der varer. Aroma og smak av mørke karameller, knekk, ristet brød, kaffe og litt sjokolade i en deilig kombinasjon. Tørr og fin bitterhet i ettersmaken gjør at den glir sorgløst over drøvelen.","Stavanger, NORWAY","Holmen1"

1404,"2014-11-08",3.2,"Very dark brown body with some reddish kind on the light, foam is quite brownish, but very stable. Some caramel and strong coffee aroma makes the overall perception a bit weaker. The body is medium - not so thin as a casual dunkel, but not as thick as a porter/stout, a bit too sweat and coffeed for my humble taste, but the pluses - refreshable and drinkable simple beer. Not art, but not so bad.","Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC","Roublard"
1404,"2014-08-07",3.8,"(Draught at Kulovy Blesk, Prague, 17 July 2014) Black colour with creamy, beige head. Malty, roasted nose with caramel, coffee, dark rye bread, liquorice and a touch of tobacco. Malty, roasted taste with notes of caramel, chocolate, coffee, black rye bread, liquorice and a gentle roasty bitterness in a finish with a slight sweetness. Medium body, with balanced sweetness. Fresh, tasty and well made dark lager in excellent balance. Very nice.","Hässelby, SWEDEN","Svesse"
1404,"2013-08-05",3.2,"Lahev(PET, 1,0l): Really deep amber coloured with ruby spots, small, but persistent off-white head; moderate sweet malty and roasty nose; moderate sweet flavour, some well hidden bitterness, medium nodied and soft; increasing dryness in the sweet dark-malty and nutty finish. Quite nice, one of the first brews of this brand-new brewery, but still too much on the sweet side","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"
