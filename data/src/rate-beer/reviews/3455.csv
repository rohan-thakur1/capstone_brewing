The aroma gets more intense after its poured to the glass. Its very sweet - barrel notes, vanilla, marzipan, chocolate. The taste is as great - chocolate liqueur, again vanilla and marzipan, some wood. The finish is coffee, nice biterness and some alcohol pleasantly warming as it goes down the throat. The mouthfeel is fantastic, the body is full, carbonation is low and the beer is very velvety on the palate. Wow, this imperial stout is a huge bourbon-barrel bomb.","","Bush_Docta"

Flavor just follows aroma: bourbon is discrete, pretty well blended with roasted grain, dark malts, creamy sweet presence of vanilla and coffee.

Flavor is fairly sweet with tons of chocolate and some lighter roast notes. Moderately strong vanilla notes. Light oak character with some faint almond and coconut notes. Medium light bourbon with some light alcohol spice. Lingering chocolate and sugar.

Its not dominated by vanilla like the non-ba version. The bourbon barrel reins the flavors in without dominating itself. The flavors all kinda harmonize. Taste is sweet and still pushes hard on that vanilla pedal. Big marshmallow flavor around a fudgey chocolate center, drizzled with bourbon caramel syrup. Soft, full body. The barrely finish pulls back on that sugar without thinning the beer out. Mikkeller does wonderful work with barrels.

3455,"2017-02-27",3.8,"Pours a viscous, motor oil black color, with no head. Very thick, leaves back alcohol legs after swirling, still producing no head at all.

Both, vanilla and the barrel are very pronounced on the nose, evoking a sweeter, warming, dessert like impression. Underneath that, there are layers of molasses, caramel, earthy coffee, all leading back to the flowery, sweet vanilla, accompanied by rich, slighty hot wood. Malts add a glazed caramel impression to the beer, illustrating the sugary, biting booze, perfectly coated up by the vanilla sweetness.

Almost no carbonation at all remains recognizable among the incredible smooth mouthfeel, highlighting the beers full body.

Tastes of earthy malts, toffee, molasses, with vanilla becoming detectable at the same time as the the warming barrel does, balanced by slightly bitter, crushed coffee beans. Overall the beer is well balanced, while I expected its taste being sweeter, leading from the aromas. Coffee, toasted malts and earthy toffee exhibit a convincing counterpart to the molasses and cane sugar in the beer, resulting in a slightly bitter, hot finish. The Bourbon is well-developed, adding a lot of depth to the vanilla, as well as a pleasant bite, enhancing the dry, earthy coffee, which turns even more present during the finish.

Overall this beer tastes very interesting to me, based on the fact that it is much more that the nose revealed. It is in no way sticky sweet, while the vanilla gets beautifully enhanced by the prominent Bourbon. Unfortunately, the beers aftertaste does not come together too well for me, as coffee, vanilla and oak blend into malty, earthy liquorice, pretty much annihilating the present, but fragile vanilla impression.","GERMANY","aleigator"

 Podsumowanie:  

Mikkeller Vanillia Shake Bourbon Barrel Aged.

Piwo o którym krążyły legendy. Sam musiałem się sporo natrudzić, żeby je zdobyć. Ludzie na grupach piwnych wymian żądali za niego najwyżej klasy amerykańskich RIS-ów.
W końcu udało się kupić VS w Mikkeller Shopie w cenie 125 DKK (ok.75 zł.).
Cena dość wysoka za małą butelkę trunku, jednak warta każdej wydanej złotówki (w tym przypadku korony duńskiej xD).
Najwyższej klasy trunek i myślę, że Top3 europejskich RIS-ów.
Uwarzone w norweskim Lervig w Stavanger.
Nie przypadkowo ich Imperial Stout - ""3 Bean Stout"" należy do mojego Top3 ze Starego Kontynentu.
Mała ciekawostka: na etykiecie widnieje napis: ""Product of Norway"" xD

Piwo wybitnie bourbonowe, gdzie akcenty whiskey, mokrego drewna, dębiny przeplatają się z gigantyczną porcją kokosa i wanilii.
Trunek pachnie obłędnie, a smakuje nieziemsko.
Wprowadza w osłupienie kubki smakowe.
Dodatkowo alkohol jest tak gładki jak w jakimś niskoekstraktywnym stoucie.

A palack felnyitását követően aztán még kevesebb esélyem maradt arra, hogy valamiféle egzakt képet alkossak erről a főzetről, ezt ugyanis objektíven nemigen állt módomban megtenni, mivel már az aromák fázisa is túlmutatott mindenen, ami a tapasztalatok alapján felmérhető lett volna: a szavak itt kevésnek bizonyulnak. A vanília szó nem képezi le ugyanis tökéletesen az élményt, amit az illatok nyújtanak, még akkor sem, ha egy tejszínes, Kinder csokoládés, kókuszos, kekszes, fehércsokis masszára csepegtetett bourbon vanília-esszenciáról beszélünk. A szerkezet aztán tökéletes terepét adja az aromák megelevenedésének, süteményes vaníliakrém, tejcsokoládé, színescukorkás fánkok vattacukros, parfümös zamata tölti be szánknak minden lehetséges szegletét; leírhatatlanul bársonyos, aromás alkoholköltemény.

The vanilla and nice whiskey balance out with a sweet barrel and a lovely vanilla. The flavor is lovely strong vanilla with a sweet meltiness, a good whiskey, and a great balance.

The finish is long and sweet with a nice layer of sweet bourbon on the tongue. A really nice beer and understandable that its so beloved among craft beer lovers. Even though its staggering 13 % alc. ABV I dont think you can smell or taste it. It gives you a nice and warm sensation down your throat and thats of course the high alcohol percentage.

Aromas are loaded with vanilla, coffee, more vanilla, bourbon, another dash of vanilla, caramel malts, light chocolate and yet more vanilla. Seriously, this beer just wreaks of vanilla! Taste is nicely balanced between the mega-sweetness of the vanilla and the heat of the bourbon. Some bitter coffee, dark chocolate notes, brown sugar and hints of char emerge and harmonize nicely. Big notes of oak and bourbon chase closely behind and lead into the finish. Vanilla lingers on the palate and provides a fairly sweet back-end to this one.

3455,"2015-05-05",4.7,"33cl bottle served in a snifter. Pitch black pour with a dark brown head which is there for the briefest moment. Aroma is massive vanilla and bourbon notes - nothing else gets a look in. I was a little concerned that the bourbon would impart an extra level of vanilla-ness on top of the already (almost) excessive vanilla shake. I neednt have worried. The bourbon barrels seemed to have created a much more harmonious balance and the coffee and chocolate are allowed to shine through more as a result. In short better in every way than the standard vanilla shake but whether the difference is worth 3x the price is very much down to the individual. Personally I would rather have 3x vanilla shakes but if the occasion warrants it this is hard to beat.","West Midlands, ENGLAND","ABT_S54"

3455,"2014-10-25",4.8,"Aroma - good, god.. this beer is brilliant in every single way. The most majestic aroma you could ever ask for from a BBA IOS that screams, Im stronger and better than all.

Appearance - darker than Darth Vader, this brew is as dark as they come--literally pitch black and viscous like the bottom of a bottle of Castrol GTX. If you dont drive hard, this beer is not for you. 

Taste - for the style, I do not know where to start, here. This stout stands out among its peers. It is brilliant. I have never tasted anything as close to vanilla bourbon in my entire life. I doubt FFFs DL Vanilla Bourbon supersedes what Mikkellers BBA Vanilla Shake is advertising. Let me put it this way, after drinking this, I honestly do not have much of a desire to try FFFs BBA DL VB stout. This did it for me. I could not be happier w/ how this beer matures over time in the bottle and in my glass! Every sip is purely a work of art. 

Palate - an explosion of vanilla, espresso, chocolate, oatmeal, and subtle, smooth bourbon on the finish. You would never know this is 13%. This beer is as close to perfect as they come in every single way. I just wish it was easier to come across. 

Overall, I envisage this brew will forever remain in my top ten beers of all time (and stouts are not even my favorite style). I drink a lot of world-class beer, too. Mikkeller, please, whatever you do, keep doing you. This was nothing shy of a magnificent beer.","The Garden of the Beer Gods, North Carolina, USA","TheGoldenChalice"
3455,"2014-10-25",4.0,"Bottle (330 ml). Thanks to Johan for this one! Pitch black with a small dark brown head and little lacing. Aroma is of vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, roasted malt, light fruitiness and sweetness. Taste is quite sweet with vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, roasted malt and dark fruits. Medium/full body. Medium carbonation. A tad creamy mouthfeel. Lingering sweet finish with a little warming presence. Enticing aroma, but the sweetness + vanilla + alcohol make it a little cloying. Quite tasty. Lack a bit of balance. Interesting.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

This was one expensive bottle, but in my opinion, very worth it. Wonderfully complex, perfect sweetness without ever being cumbersome... Incredible beer.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Super chocolateyamazing smell, full on cholate assault without a hint of any boozy or off flavors. I am super impressed.

3455,"2014-03-07",4.1,"Bottle. My much-awaited post-exam treat. Expectations are seriously high because the base beer was just amazing. Thick black pour with no head forming. Aroma - lots of vanilla and bourbon, chocolate, sweet. Very sniffable. Body is medium to big, smooth and rich. Taste - much more liquorice sweetness than the base beer, bourbon is well integrated and brings a little spice, still carries chocolate notes but the vanilla and coffee seem to be left behind by the bourbon. Some high notes of lime. Sweetness is quite pronounced. Some very good features to this. The base beer is £10 cheaper and, in my opinion, nicer.  This one is too sweet to the extent that it gets tiring.","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"

3455,"2014-01-28",4.5,"Bottle
Pours black, small to good brown head, pretty steady , unlike i expected .. 
Smell is intense vanilla . There is some - small - difference than what i remember the vanilla shake ( regular ) to be , but I wouldnt call it straight bourbon or oak . There is some more sweetness though . Gives the idea it will be a perfect blend, not overkill-bourbon Barrel aged , I like that !
low carbonation , thick mouthfeel 
Taste is way less intense vanilla than the regular . sweet, some hints of oak , maybe even a bit of bourbon . 
Than comes vanilla , underneath a spine of oats . 
Nice long , vanilla-bourbon finish . 
Nowhere is there to much bourbon . If I did not knew it was in there , I Probably wouldnt have guessed it . Its very very balanced !
The only downside ( and i never complained about this , I drank like 2200 beer before, some incredible whales included ) is the price . near to 20 euros for a small bottle , plus super expensive shipping ( Denmark charges a lot , its not mikkellers fault ! ) Is really, really much , counting ze got the regular vanilla shake here for like 6 euros each , I believe . Barrels cost a lot, but not THAT much ( or are they pappy barrels ? ) On the other hand, i got a free glass with it , plus incredible service, as always .. 

Very good beer , would buy way more if affortable","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"
