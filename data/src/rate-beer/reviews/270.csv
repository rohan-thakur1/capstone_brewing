270,"2015-09-05",5.0,"My favorite alcoholic beverage. Very fun but simple. Easy to drink, as if mineral water was alcoholic. I wish I could find it in stores so I could stock my fridge with it. Not overly sweet at all but not overly ""saké"" either. Perfect for saké beginners such as myself. I find I like some saké better than wine so wish there was a bigger market for this kind of saké.","","Ashleyaugust"

Lower alcohol is fine, clear, and a little sweet mid taste but dries out near the end.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"

270,"2014-01-11",3.3,"bottle - This sake has a pale, nearly clear color with an aroma of rice and light fruit. It honestly tastes rather like a lightly sweet hard apple cider. Its bubbly, light and refreshing.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"
