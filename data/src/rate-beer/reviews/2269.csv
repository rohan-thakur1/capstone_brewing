Its not only completely convincing as a Belgian Abt, its one of the softest-drinking and most cohesive beers Ive tried. Textbook brown-colored pour. Malty and fruity aromas with subtle spices. Taste profile consists of chocolate, prune, plum, raisin, molasses, and dessert wine. The booze is completely hidden away.

A wire and cork opening, be sure it is not aimed at anyone after the cage comes off. The good news, I did not lose any product. With a pour I call it inky darkness, you can put any color you want on it. A large, just short of white, finely bubbled head, very nice lacing. The scent is a walk through the orchard. It gives up red plum and maybe fig, red cough drops. The taste, oh my, a yeasty ripe fruit start leading to maltiness, spice and a slight bitterness finishing. The alcohol is looking around the corner at me. Well done.Trois Pistoles may be slightly better. I will gladly take either one.","Midland, Texas, USA","KevinReddirt"

The flavor is a little more complex. There is the metallic malts and a nice caramel and dark fruit with the spicy malt and some interesting sweetness on the back end.

2269,"2014-12-28",4.5,"Im so thrilled to have got the chance of grabbing a bottle of this refined brew after waiting for like 2 years! Very enjoyable pour of a deep brown shade of high opacity topped by a sustantial tanned head finely structured and letting guess a creamy feel. Retention is excellent and lacing is verry god, too. The nose is dense wih sweet banana, roasted malts, yeasts and a sweet/bitter spicy presence I couldnt identify. This ale is sweet, spicy and nutty with again candied banana and a great harmony between the hops and yeasts giving it lots of depth. I found the bitterness just right, giving kick to the taste but without overpowering anything. The mouthfeel can be described as dense, vapory and creamy bearing a slight sharpness at first hand. The downer is a mild aftertaste but no ale is perfect.This brew evolves as it heats so serve it cold and let it reach 10 - 12 degrees to release more boldness. Overall the best features of this ale (besides its name) were its depth, density and originality compared to other brews offered by Unibroue.

Some similar flavors (dark fruit, yeast, spices) that other belgians have had, but more elegant and restrained here, with a choclatey aspect as well as wine-like complexity.

There are fruity/estery notes with hints of sweet-tart black cherries, dry yeast and bready maltiness.

More complex and real surprising for a brew you can find in a super market! Flavor is a myriad of malty flavors with yeasty notes. Prunes, figs, dates, English toffee.

2269,"2014-06-14",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 5-12-12- 
Served in a 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance  Served a deep brownish-red, nearly black color with a tiny off white head. The head faded fast to give only a little bit of lacing.

Smell  The aromas are big and bold of dark fruit. Cherries and plum are quite big and when mixed with a lighter alcohol, yeast, and sweet fig aroma give a very nice fruity smell.

Taste  The taste follows the nose very nicely. A cherry sweetness starts out the taste. There is a lighter tasting dark bread flavor mixed with the cherry. These flavors are soon met with some other darker fruit flavors that come to the tongue. The fig and plum that were present in the nose, as well as some lighter flavors of molasses and yeast mix with the cherry and bread. At the end these flavors mingle with a light warming alcohol flavor, that all in all, leave a very pleasant sweet and warming aftertaste on the tongue.

Mouthfeel The mouthfeel is a bit above normal in thickness for the average brew, but light for a beer of this high abv. The carbonation level is quite average and very appropriate for matching the body and the flavors. 

Overall  This was one very nice and tasty brew. It had some great dark fruit flavors with just the right hint of warming alcohol to make it very easy to sit back and sip with enjoyment.","","Darkmagus82"

I poured this into a chalice.
The appearance was a decent looking dark color with a half finger white foamy head that rises a tad and eventually lowers leaving a decent coating of a lacing gracing the sides of the glass.
The smell was once again just like the last time, too vinous, with some light plums and Belgian spices.
The taste was sweet but vinous over taking the Belgian spices that wanted to come out but never did. There was a vinous-like plum sweet aftertaste with a long dry finish.
On the palate, it sat about a medium with a pummeling dry-ing like effect putting my tongue into submission. The carbonation is decent for the style and to me. Its vinous and harsh and dry.

2269,"2013-12-03",3.9,"(750mL from the LCBO, aged 1 year) Pours a very deep brown with mahogany highlights, like a strong cup of coffee, with a big pale tan head of fine bubbles, lots of lace. Aroma is dark fruit (seems figgy), dark candy sugar, very bready yeast, a bit of cherry note and maybe slight toast in there too. On the palate there is dark grape juice, candy sugar, some other misc. dark fruit character, slightly toasty/nutty but not very much. Yeast character throughout the sip. There is some currant/grape character in the middle and a definite dry/bitter character to the finish with persistent yeast/fruit. There is decent concentration of flavour, but its not shockingly intense. There is a fair amount of alcohol warmth in the finish, but probably not enough to match the ABV. The palate is medium full and would be slightly sticky without the high, prickly carbonation. I like this, its a good Belgian strong dark, but maybe just lacks the complexity to kick it into that top rank.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

Aroma of liquid bread with toasted malt, yeast and light fruit. Taste of strong bready yeast, brown sugar, mild dark fruit and some sweet malt. Finishes up a bit boozy and so uninspiring.

The body is medium/full, the texture creamy, the carbonation lively and the finish a long bitter/sour. A good beer. Always been a Canadian fan, since we have to go south to get there!

2269,"2013-11-17",4.3,"Pours a deep mahogany that has sublte hues of cola and dark caramel brown. Impeccable clarity even though it is almost completely opaque. If you turn you attention to the bottom of the glass you can clearly see the tiny champagne like bubbles rising furtively to the top. The head is tan and creamy. Its slow to fall and it constantly refreshes with each turn of the glass leaving a pretty thick layer on top. Sheets of lace to look at as they slid back down into the beer as you drink. 

Nose is belgian yeast, earthy and woody. Te vibrant scent of ripe cherries. A dark fruit quality overall but nothing you can pinpoint and call raisin or fig or prune. The malt is perfectly roasted with an earthy depth of its own. It seems to come right to the edge of all the dark roast scents like chocolate or coffee but stops right at the edge of the yeast. That is terribly exciting as its grain promises a smooth and rich earth all its own with only a hint at sweetness on the nose that isnt from fruit. Its a touch nutty as ti warms. There is some clove to round out the nose. 

The taste is pure delight. It has the tart and lively cherry, the earthy dryness of the belgian yeast, the depth of the roasted malt. The malt is as smooth and delicate as such a dark roast could possibly be. The clove and spice add a bit more complexity. The carbonation is ticklish and tiny bubbles that add to the lightness of the body. The drink is just a touch boozy and to your delight. It is only a faint warmth as you swallow and the carbonation lightens that as well. 

Add this one to the beers you must have by unibroue. Expressive in the glass from its stately appearance to its sumptuous flavors. This beer is vigorous and bewitching.","New York, USA","pinkie"

2269,"2013-09-17",4.1,"Portion of a 750ml bottle into a Duvel tulip. From two day old notes.

A: Pours a dark ruby color. A two finger khaki-colored head is formed, and retains itself nicely. Minimal lacing.

S: I notice a bit of earthy, bready yeast, which slowly builds into dark fruits. Chocolate even pops up at times. The person I drank with found this to have a funky aroma. I wouldnt say funky, but I would say complex.

T: The fruit esters on the opening really make themselves known immediately. Not just with stewed dark fruits (raisins, plums, figs, etc...), but with a strong cherry note, also. Actually, this is ridiculously cherry forward. Slight chocolate touches give way to a bready finish. Just a really balanced, likable BSDA.

M: This has a good thickness, a creamy feel, solid carbonation, and a dry finish all at the same time. When I was sipping it, I half-thought it was a well-hidden 8%...when I found out it was really 10.5%, I nearly fell on my face. One of the more dangerous brews Ive encountered in terms of drinkability.

O: I really enjoyed this one. Like I said before, dangerous is the key word here - this could perhaps be chugged. Theres enough flavor and complexity to make one want to sit and savor this instead...and last time I checked, thats the hallmark of a great beer.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Appearance: The beer appears a dark chestnut on the pour and light is only visible through the edges, exposing a clear chestnut body. The head tan and dense, but rather thin with average retention. The head settles into a full coating.
Aroma: Dark fruits are the strongest with grapes and raspberries that come to mind. Toffee and brown sugar underlie the fruits with a hint of cocoa.
Taste: The flavor is strong with a medicinal grape flavor coming through hugely with a sweet toffee flavor that comes in towards the end of the taste with a lingering spice.
Palate: Thick and slightly syrupy, fizzy carbonation.
Overall: This is a great alternative to a port wine. This is a bold beer with lots of fruity flavors with a spice to it that gives it a medicinal flavor. Its not overly complex, but its interesting.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

2269,"2013-01-15",4.0,"La Terrible dUnibroue, à 10.5% dalcool, a une couleur brun foncé qui tire vers le noir. Attention toutefois, elle na rien à voir avec les noires Stout, ni par larôme, ni par le goût. Au nez, elle offre des parfums subtils dépices, de sucre et de fruits confits. Belle effervescence. Cette bière créée en 2002 a un goût de porto, de sucre brun, et de petits fruits telle la cerise noire. Idéalement, laissez tempérer cette bière avant de la déguster ; les aromates seront plus évidents et lexpérience, enrichie. La finale nest pas amère ; elle laisse place aux sucres et donne un bel équilibre. Jaime beaucoup les produits Unibroue en général. Cette bière étant plus chère que ses frères et soeurs, je ne penserais pas la racheter toutefois. Pour moi, les produits standard comme la Fin du Monde et la Trois-Pistoles sont plus intéressants au niveau qualité-prix. En revanche, cette bière mérite dêtre dégustée au moins une fois si vous aimez ce porte-étendard de la microbrasserie au Québec, ce pilier, qui plus est, cette tête de proue de la vraie bière de lAmérique du Nord.

2269,"2012-09-28",4.8,"From Notes, 4/28/12:

Poured a 750ml bottle into a Duvel snifter. Taken out of the fridge and rested for about 40 minutes to bring to serving temp. Best by date of 04-15-15. Poured carefully as to not disturb yeast sediment.

A: Nearly opaque dark brown. Light beige head that dissipates slowly.

S: Took a quick whiff of the cork and got green apple peel. Dark fruits, raisins, figs. Caramel and brown sugar there as well. Also a spiciness Im assuming is from the alcohol.

T: Outstanding. Raisins and brown sugar more pronounced. Caramel and chocolate in the middle. The green apple seems to reappear very faintly in the finish. Peppery alcohol. Mild hop bitterness there for balance.

M: Lush and full. Carbonation is just a little high, alcohol bite noticable; probably didnt let this one sit long enough; I dont apologize.

O: Complexity is great on this one. This may surpass Maudite as my favorite. As has become my habit, I love mixing the yeast sediment in my second glass when it comes to Unibroue brews. It did not disappoint.","Austin, Texas, USA","videofrog"

2269,"2012-06-11",4.2,"Terrible pours an opaque brown color which comes to look deep and murky once in the glass. Reds and Browns peek from the edges but very little light peeks through the beer. A two finger head of light beige takes its time disappearing. Lacing is very prevalant.

The first thing on the nose is the faint scent of apples, quickly overtaken by raisins, figs and a general dark fruit scent. An extremely sweet smelling malt makes up the center and faint alcohol peeks it;s head out. Theres a Belgian yeast here that sits inside all of the other aromas giving things a spicy note and making it quite interesting. The nose is complex and very promising.

Raisins, figs and cherries are up front on the tongue and help to produce a light tartness on the first splash. The middle is characterized by a sweet, faintly roasty malt flavor accompanied by the spicy Belgian yeast. It fits together wonderfully. The yeast carries to the end where fruity esters start to show and the only hint of alcohol in this 10.5% brew is noticed.

Theres a slight oily quality in the mouth but you can definitely feel the low attenuation here. The natural carbonation helps though and carries this flavor exceptionally well.

Awesome. Unibroue has yet to let me down and with Terrible, theyve set the bar even higher for themselves. Sweet, yeasty with a slight malt background. Definitely a must try for any Belgian fan.","Anna, Illinois, USA","mtlasley"

4.0 A: Black color. Two fingers of frothy, faint tan colored head. Retention is solid for the ABV, but no lacing is left.

4.0 S: Pleasant mixture of dark maltiness and dark fruitiness. Light supple roast, lots of chocolate, some caramel and molasses. Fruits including lots of fig and lesser amounts of plum, date, and raisin. Clove spiciness from the yeast with hints of pepper. A touch of candi sugar.

4.5 T: Very tasty and well balanced. Again theres lots of chocolate followed by a light roast with caramel and molasses. Fig heavy fruitiness with plum, date, and raisin. Clove and pepper spiciness. Candi sugar. A lot of fine Belgian brews are delicious, but often too subtle and require that the drinker concentrate to get the full experience. This is not one of those beers. The flavors are intense by Belgian standards and mesh extremely well together.

4.5 M: Unibroue yeast is awesome for creating wonderful, spritzy mouthfeels and this is no different. Light to lighter medium body. Good spritzy carbonation. Super smooth with just the right amount of creaminess.

2269,"2011-12-29",3.1,"I seem to be going against the grain judging from other views but for me this was a bit of a disappointing effort from one of the best breweries for strong Belgian style ales. Unibroue is usually good at hiding the high alcohol content of their beers but this fully tastes like a 10.5% beer. At that percentage it is not possible to mask the alcohol but it need not be overwhelming either like it is here. This beer lacks the subtlety of many of Unibroues other beers. A sweet syrupy/wine-like taste that is strongly of burnt malt and caramel. Not a bad beer but nowhere near the standard or complexity of Maudite or La Fin du Monde.","Quebec, CANADA","UM02"

Mouthfeel is foamy, medium bodied, a bit fizzy.  A fantastic BSDA, and another winner from Unibroue!

2269,"2011-03-07",4.5,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 750ml bottle into a tulip glass. This bottle is labeled ""Best Before 02-26-2012"".

Appearance: It has a very dark brown colored body that is nearly opaque. A tall tan head of big soft bubbles slowly settles down to a finger of thick and creamy foam. Lacing is thick, sticky and coats the glass.

Smell: The aroma is light and delicate. I get modest hints of sweet bready and mildly funky yeast with some fruity notes of dark cherries.

Taste/Palate: There are fruity/estery notes with hints of sweet-tart black cherries, dry yeast and bready maltiness. This is balanced by a very light herbal leafy hop presence that also adds a light bitterness and a slight mineral or metallic touch. The palate feels smooth and creamy with mellow yet very active carbonation and a good solid medium to full body.

Notes: Overall this is a very well made beer from a solid brewery.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

The flavor contains dark fruit, but not dates and raisins as in other BDSAs, rather black currants and prunes.

Trois Pistole-ish aroma, only less sharp, and a little buttery (in a good way).  Yeasty, (dark) fruity flavour, with some candi sweetness.  On the sweet side.

2269,"2010-09-19",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2010 Bottle.

A - Very dark cola brown, almost black, with a bit of a dark cherry walnut hue on the edge. Pretty large, light, fluffy, cloudy, stick, foamy, off-white head. Pretty good retention with a nice sticky, foamy layer of lace.

S - Nice dark fruit with a good plum, fig, and raisin flavors. A touch of dark cherry. Some bubble gum aroma as well. A lot of Belgian yeast and candi sugar as well. Has a full jamy aroma. A pretty good amount of spice and fairly sweet.

T - Get a lot of rum soaked dark fruit (similar to the nose) giving it a bit of a vinous/plumy flavor. Some dark bread/malt and a touch of burnt brown sugar is in the background. Fair amount of bubblegum and phenol flavors come in and out. Belgian spiciness and yeast and the candi sugar are pretty up front, definitely taste like a Belgian style beer. Alcohol is present through out the sip, but not overly strong.

M - Medium body with plenty of carbonation. A little light/thin feeling for the style/ABV. A bit of a zesty feel with a sticky and drying finish.

D - Definitely a sipper with some strong, bold flavors. With a lot of spice, sweetness, and alcohol heat no one flavor overpowers, but it is a little much to drink a lot in one night.

Notes: A good offering from Unibroue, that definitely had a Belgian taste. Pretty bold, strong flavors gave it a feel that it wasnt perfectly balanced, but it didnt really seem out of balance. Overall it is an enjoyable beer that would be nice to have every once in awhile.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Pours a murky dark cocoa brown with cola highlights. Head is three finger and sticks impressively stays around a while.

Aroma is powerful! Dark roasted malt with a hefty dose of fruity yeastiness. Fruitiness in the middle from the yeast there is also a burnt toast aroma from the malt. Finishes with band aid and tropical fruit yeast with a dose of dark chocolate.

Flavor opens with dark fruit. Yeast takes the top of the profile with bready dark roasted malt following. Middle brings banana and bubble gum with a shot of warming alcohol. Bitterness in the finish from the roast, nost any hop flavor can really be detected. Finishes sweet with a warming of booze down the gullet.

Carbonation is higher than I would think for a bottle conditioned beer, but this works to cut the sweetness some. The only suffer to the drinkability is the higher ABV.

Nice, split the bomber with someone.

Aromas of raisins, plums, browned sugar, and a bit of a metalic aroma coming through as well.  There are some noticeable spices from the yeasts that were used.  The yeasts also give this a bit of a bread-y aroma that is really nice.  The flavor is predominately about the spices.  Clove and coriander really seem to be in charge here permitting some of the darker fruits to come forth.  The darker fruits really are more subdued and their sweetness comes in a distant second to the spices.  As the beer warms, the spices seem to not be near as strong and some of the softer flavors like sweet browned sugar, a bit of molasses, and sweet plums seem to become a little more bold in flavor.

2269,"2009-08-07",4.3,"750ml bottle - $8.48 at Sherlocks in Marietta, Georgia. Best Before: 2-26-2012.

Appearance: Pours an opaque, walnut brown body with an appropriately tall, foamy, light tan head.

Smell: Sweet-scented, malty nose coming across as a plated up Shoofly Pie for dessert along with some secondary notes of dark fruits and spice.

Taste: Dark, not-quite-roasty maltiness with flavors of molasses, dark brown sugar, dark candi sugar, and sweetened cocoa-flavored coffee. Burst of black cherry, sour cherry, and cooked raisin fruitiness. Earthy spiciness with a hint of black pepper and ground cardamom. Small touch of alcohol warmth, though, as it warms somewhat, it becomes a moderate pinch of alcohol warmth. Finishes dry but also malty with a taste of, well, again, Id say Shoofly Pie, but I feel that reference would be entirely lost on most.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Well carbonated with a tingly, altogether bubbly mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Paired remarkably well with the movie ""Casino"". Id pair the last third with some food to see how it goes, but I only have yogurt and ramen, so... Easily one of the better Unibroue brews Ive had, but, sadly, not one I often see around in Georgia. Ah well, such is life.

2269,"2009-08-04",4.3,"Her cork lets loose with a brilliant pop and his, freeing a billowing white mist that broils and eeks over the rim of the bottle. As she roils into my large, bulbous chalice, she melts into an array of deep ambers, garnets, rubies, and brown-black tigers eye. It should come as no surprise that she quickly sports a rising head of large bubbles; fading just as quickly, she cuts a discernable trail of lace on her way down to her final destination. Her haze and head dissipated, she gives free reign to a rich nose that oozes moist prunes, plums, dates, raisins, and licorice root atop warm dark breads drizzled with melted brown sugars and cinnamon. A crisp apply presence cuts through her thick, sweeter side to reveal hand-picked crunchy red apples and pears just in season that leads into a sweet nip of alcohol warmth. Lips wet with anticipation, I dive into her awaiting depths, only to be met with an explosion of bubbly effervescence and vivaciousness that lifts both body and soul. Concentrated sugar sweetness hits first in all her succulent dark fruits glory even as burgeoning warmth makes her presence known. Cinnamon sticks and spice tingle on top of my tongue and compliment her warmth which lingers in my breath. There is a surprising presence of tartness which also nips and plays with my senses while crisp crunchy apples contrast chewy warm dark breads that seem to ooze rum, spices, and molasses. As she warms, her body remains effervescent and pleasantly light which helps La Terrible maintain her refreshing palate. Once more, Unibroue steps up to my plate and hits a home-run on all accounts. Now to just sit back, sup, and savor the last of my La Terrible. No notes allowed.


Oh Unibroue, how I love thee, let me count the ways


Seriously, dont think, dont doubt. Find your nearest liquor store and take home as much Unibroue as you can. They have about 10 year round beers that are available either in large 750ml bottles or 4packs. They have best-buy dates on the back which are usually within a 2-3 year range depending on the beer. Freshness need not apply because we are talking natural, quality ingredients and brewing. Long live Unibroue.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

2269,"2009-07-21",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2011 750 ml. bottle. Best before date of 2/26/12. Pours a happy mocha head, over a slightly cloudy, dark brown (SRM 28) body.....nose is heavy with dried fruit, cherry, raisin, prune, also banana, bubblegum drift in along with slight molasses, add a bit of yeasty bread....taste is very similar, with many dried fruit tones, cherry, prune, raisin, fig, somewhat sweet throughout, but finishes fairly dry....mouth feel is thick, but surprisingly light, carbonation is medium. A lovely thing, not too heavy, the alcohol which lightens it is hidden by the thick esthers and light phenols. Re enjoyed 12/1/11. Bottle dated best before 1/30/16.

2269,"2009-07-01",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2011 Re-rate after many, many years.... of all the beers Ive found over the years, this one stood out as a re-rate. I barely remembered it the first time, one of the first monster beers Id tried, so it was certainly high on my list should I encounter it again. It appeared in Vancouver, and I obliged to take on the monster bottle. This pours pitch-dark with a huge smooth head. The aroma is of oak and cherries, some yeast and citrus. The flavour is a huge and smooth morass of molasses, yeast, sugary esters and barley. Wet finish. After years and years of rating so many different beers, this remains one of my favourites. Worth every penny to re-connect with an old classic and its great that Unibroue is still making it.

-------& rating 7/1/2009
Probably the best way to get knocked out.... a dark brew, very smooth, but by the time youre halfway through this monster bottle youll have forgotten anything about what the beer was when it started. Not like thats a bad thing, though. 8/5/9/4/16","Alberta, CANADA","DeanF"

2269,"2009-06-20",3.8,"Enjoyed from a 750ml bottle in a chalice.  The beer pours a deep brown with a lively just-off-white head.  Aromas of banana, Belgian character malts, toffee, prunes, and raisons sneak through.  The initial taste is a touch on the grainy side, and the overall palate is a little less full than offerings such as St. Bernardus Abt 12 and Het Ankor Grand Cru of the Emperor.  The middle to end of the palate brings sweet flavors of slightly burnt caramel and some yeast-derived esters.  The yeast seems to be a cross between the fruity Chimay variety and the ""darker fruity"" and more restrained Westmalle type.  Overall, a great Belgian syle from North Americas Belgian brewery","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Flavour is a perfect reflection of the aroma, with a mild boozy touch that is well in check. So well integrated, the medley of flavours come in delicious waves. Yeasty as one would expect from Unibroue, and theres a minor hint of roasty malts in there. This is definitely the best Unibroue product Ive had so far, so well done.

Thick, pebbly, tan head with wonderful lacing and a patchy film that stayed strong throughout. Wonderful Belgian aromas of figs, raisins, plums. Hints of dark malts, bread, and brown sugar suggest something special once I get around to drinking this. And the flavor profile does not disappoint. The dark fruits lay the foundation up front, then a generous helping of hops and a clear earthy yeastiness follow right behind.

A small, foamy, khaki colored head settles to a thin blanket, leaving minimal spotting behind. The nose is heavy on raisin, dark fig and caramel lending further sweet malt. Earthen spices include nutmeg and clove, with hints of molasses and candied orange peel lnding nice complexity. Flavors follow suit, big dark raisin and hints of cocoa are accompanied by brown sugar, burnt caramel, and various winter spices. That  signature, bready, ethereal Unibroue yeast is there throughout. The palate is big and full, sweet but never cloying, with a nice, semi-dry finish. Very good brew. You can tell it has benefited from some bottle aging.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

2269,"2009-05-01",3.5,"750ml corked bottle.
Near black opaque body, dense thick beige head that hangs around.
Plenty of bready, doughy yeast on the nose. Lots of spice; pepper, clove, vanilla, slight citrus hopiness, subtle dark fruits.
Suprisingly lean bodied for the strength, spritzy carbonation, bit of creaminess about the texture. Ends with an odd sharpness.
Yeast seems to dominate the palate. Lots of spicy phenolics; pepper, unripe plums, prunes, the odd bit of oxidised dried fruit. Finishes mildly bitter, slight roasted astrigency.
Bit disappointing. Quite similiar to other Unibroue beer, Trios Pistoles particularly, but not as well balanced or complex.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

yellowy tinted dark woody brown with a huge fluffy beige head. it leaves behind an enormous amount of spotty lacing... almost unreal!

very fruity aroma though i cant attempt to single one particular smell out... vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon, rich earthy yeast and its bitterness and something like a nicely oxidized white burgundy.

theres more fruit in the flavor along with hints of vanilla, raisins, chocolate cream,  flowers, brown sugar-y malt, yeast and light warm spice on the finish. the body is medium. relatively thin mouth feel given the abv% and the amount of flavor packed in but its quite smooth.

Another beer Ive been wanting to try, but I have been to cheap and had too many other beers Ive been trying to taste first.  Black tan med/small bubble head.  Sweetish.  A hint of caramel.

Some hop  bitterness present, and a dry finish.  The  yeast provides some esters, not overbearing.  Some definite alcoholic warmth at the end.  A flavorful brew, but I am not sure all the flavors mesh perfectly.  This maybe could have been aged more, a little fresh.  Probably a mistake to drink this so early  Unibroue makes high quality Belgian-style beer and although I havent tasted many side-by-side, they seem to make a lot of similar styles; a ton of Belgian dark strong ales.  Not that they are bad, but maybe they could have some more variety","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","joshwilfong"

Poured a nice dark brown murky hazed hue with a nice light brown/tannish head that sticks around, in a decent amount. Aromas are chocolate and dark fruits, more somber belgian yeastiness. Taste is similar up front, mixing chocolate and sweetness into darker, dried fruits. My friend caught hints of coffee, but I did not. Raisins and plums mixed with the subtle cocoa. Yum.

Flavor is a jumble of varied things, which include but are not limited to chocolate, cherry, dates, and malt.  All of this complemented by the trademark Unibroue prickly carbonation.  La Terrible finishes spicy with cinnamon, and with more than a tickle of alcohol to let you know it isnt screwing around.  re-rated 12/6/09:  I seemed to have missed the very forward spiced element of this brew!  At a private tasting, I got pronounced dark candi sugar, allpsice, and cardomum.

This ones slightly distinct from some of the other offerings, insofar as theres a more pronounced fruity presence in both the nose and in the taste itself. Sweet malts are in there, with enough hops to keep things crisp and lively.

The taste was similar; dark fruit; plum and grapes, a ton of yeast, and a sweet candy aspect that is nice and not overpowering. Strong, but not in any way too much. Awesome.

The beer had a cloudy, dark brown to almost black color with a very dark tan, creamy head, that had modest retention and size, and clung to the edges of the glass.  The aroma was subtle but very pleasant, featuring some toffee and raisin tones, with perhaps some other fruits such as bananas, and a bit of caramel malt.  The taste is a sweet dense fruity and candy blend with a pleasant bitterness on the side.  Its mouthfeel was superb, a creamy, velvety texture with amazing smoothness and only a hint of the heavy alcohol content appearing.

But seriously,  while Unibroues line of beverages is great, several in their product line are all incredibly similar in aroma, mouthfeel, complexity and finish. Terrible, Fin du Mode, and Trois Pistoles are all far more alike than dissimilar. Its enjoyable with that fruity carbonation and slight heat. I still prefer Trois Pistoles of those 3 however.

Flavor: toasty malty start, too the corn and wheat. Progress of the sweet-spicy present in the ingredients like aniseed, paprika and ginger; too other tones reminiscent of clove, nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla.

2269,"2007-12-06",2.8,"The cork succumbs with a struggle and a muffled pop, and I decant a surprisingly inky, matte muddiness. Brilliant back-illumination produces only the dimmest ruby glow. A sand colored, rocky head crackles busily, throbbing with animation, yet apparently devouring its own lacy leavings.  I inhale the expected Unibroue nose of rummy caramelized sugar and plum, with welcomely novel whiffs of cocoa powder, cardamom-laced coffee, lemon, and pine. Warm pipe tobacco and pumpkin pie scents offer soft contrast, and actually dominate once the churning foam subsides. Syrupy and uberfruity flavors ensue: boysenberry jam and plum, unripe pineapple, tart cherry, bubblegum, and antique books and leather. A clipped finale follows; a grating conspiracy of Turkish coffee, sourdough yeastiness, balsawood shavings, and oiled metal. The overall soft palate is punctured by puppyteeth nips of lively, pinpoint carbonation, generating a rubbery and gritty effect. Our liquid sojourn concludes with a star anise and composting pear aftertaste, and cloying, clovey bittersweetness (skewed far more towards sweet.) In general, this ale offers scant complexity and jittery unbalance; a disappointing dud from a normally notable brewer.","New Mexico, USA","maltdog"

On the very end is a little bite and an alcohol feel.  Its surprising as to how light it feels for being such a dark brew at 10.5%. and yet its full with bold flavor.

Sweet, dark malts, brown sugar, grapes, corriander, figs, bubble-gum yeast, cherry and cinnimon spice on the finish. This is insanely complex and the flavours are well supported by a full, creamy body that finishes aromatic. It is slightly chalky, but for some reason its not offensive for being so.

Note ; Ive bought two cases of this brew in the past year, one in Seattle and one in Dallas. "" So far "", I ve found two bottles to be totally flat.

2269,"2007-04-04",4.0,"I couldnt believe my charming and vivacious wife brought me home a beer that said right on the lable that it was TERRIBLE!     I gave her a terribly hard time about this, but shes a good woman.  I served the beer in a snifter glass and we rated it jointly as a training exercise.  An aggressive pour yielded a strong two-finger tan head, which diminished at a normal rate to an 1/8 inch. The head seems to hang around indefinitely, and can be easily replenished with swirl of the glass.  Aroma of carbonation, malt, and just a note of smoke and alcohol.  Color is a clear dark brown.  Carbonation is fairly high, typical of what I have come to expect of Unibroue beers, delivering both a smooth creaminess and a little pop on the tongue. Flavor is moderate dominated by toasted malt, a little nuttiness, some residual sweetness, and just enough bitterness to provide balance.  Finish is a mild and pleasant toasted malt bitterness.  A little lacing is left on the glass.  As usual, Unibroue has done well, this is a terribly good beer in my book.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Sombeast"

I wished it was more complex, and darker. I felt that it just wasnt decidedly dark or not dark. It floated along in the middle not really deciding which way to go. I wanted something super roasty, chocolaty and maybe even burnt. Had it just said ""strong ale"" on there, I might have been a bit more understanding of what it was trying to be.

Much smoother than Trois Pistoles.  Dried fruits and bakers chocolate with a dry finish. No noticable hops. The house yeast isnt too noticable here.

Finishes average length (for a Belgian) and sweet with chocolate and raisin and noticable alcohol presence.  Nice, very malty, unquestionably bold Belgian from Unibroue.

Pours a clear dark brown colored body under a fairly small very fizzy beige head that lasted forever due to the excess carbonation.  Aroma is classic Unibroue.  Lots of fruitiness, though with a slightly thicker malt presence than most of their beers, with lots of their characteristic yeast.  Notes of raison, plum, and coffee.  Flavor mirrors aroma, various dark fruits, lots of Unibroue yeast, even stronger on the raison and plum.  Lightly peppery on the finish.  Mouthfeel is identical to most of the other Unibroue beers Ive had.  Medium bodied with tons of fizzy prickly carbonation that makes for a foamy mess.  This is probably the beer that benefited more than any Ive had in a long time from being allowed to breathe for a long time.  Each of the three glasses I had out of this bottle were much better 45 minutes after pouring than directly after.

There was beautiful carbonation and I could actually see the head building up from the bottom as it slowly disolved from the top. Lacing was fair. There was light malt aroma and some light yeast but plum, apple and red wine were the dominant odors. There was also a touch of alcohol. I loved the aroma, but it could have been a little stronger with less alcohol. There were heavy flavors of sweet, dark fruit (like figs) and a touch of chocolate with just a little bitterness and a short finish.  The flavor improved greatly as it warmed. The body was medium to full and both a little dry and a little syrupy with fizzy carbonation and a moderate alcohol finish. Great carbonation but not enough body.

Pours a dark brown with an off-white bubbly rocky and large head. Beautiful aroma of vanilla, prunes, whiskey and banana. The first mouthful was a little overcarbonated, but as the beer settled and warmed (even more than the serving temp of about 13degC)  a sweet alcoholic bouquet of oak, more vanilla and dried fruits came through. There was little hop flavours and the finish was remarkably clean and lacked any alcohol burn as Ive felt in so many belgians before.

There is also the Unibroue yeast, and some sharp vinious qualities that compliment the rich smoothness of the other flavors.  There are also some caramel and toffee notes as it warms.  The beer is medium bodied, lighter than expected, and smooth with semi-sharp carbonation.  The taste has a tone of dark fruit as described in the aroma.  Very smooth taste.  The mouthfeel gets thicker the warmer it gets as well as the carbonation taming down.  Lots of Belgium earthiness.  The malt is very dark and creamy.  Finish adds a bit of spice.

Smell: Dark fruits and port with lots of sweetness in the nose.

Taste: Red wine like a Cabernet and Port with loads of spices and fruits, plumb on the top. More sugar sweetness and caramel. Plenty of toastyness. There are also hints of woodiness and fusel alcohol coming through to warm the belly. A nice dry finish.

There is also a very interesting alcohol heat in the back of the throat up to the sinuses sort of phenomenon, rather than a alcohol in the mouth to the stomach... weird, but nice!  This is the major selling point of the beer, to me.  The flavor is intense and complex.  First that dry fruity champagne alcohol flavor with a bit of sweetness.  Theres a bit of roast upfront that increases in intensity into strong charcoal as the flavors develop.

2269,"2006-03-19",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 18, 2011 Plastic sample cup at the Penn Museum.  This was very good.  Rich brown with yummy fruits.  More ooomph than I remember from the Trois Pistoles.  Will need to secure a specimen for dissection.  3/18/11 - 25.4 oz bottle, 2004.  Nose is dates, figs, mushrooms and damp forest floor, but in a good way.  Body is medium but feeling thin with dull carb.  Taste is kind of like the smell but more earthy, musty with just a hint of burnt caramel and bitter clove.  It would be unfair to change my rating for a brew 4 years past the suggested drink by date.  This would have fallen to a 3.4.  I can however state that this is not one i would cellar for more than a few years.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"

2269,"2006-03-18",4.4,"Many thanks to my good friend Beerblockaid for this 750 bottle (2004 version).  What a wonderful treat to enjoy on St Pattys day and rate for my 300th brew.  The pour was dark and thick and foamed up a huge fluffy tan head which dropped away to a thin skim, and later disappeared completely.  The aroma was sweet and inviting with apple and dark fruits.   The flavor was yummy, each sip makes you want another..  dark fruits, banana, and cola  a bit of sweetness but not overly so..   Full, rich flavor, almost chewy but not quite.  Clean finish with a bit of spice (clove) and dryness.   You get the Unibroue yeast flavor but not over the top as in the Trois Pistoles.  Its fairly complex but this is not the notable characteristic.   The most notable thing about it is that its absolutely delicious without being too sweet or bitter or anything else.  Beautifully balanced.   The alcohol will sneak up on you in a hurry but you wont notice until you are already buzzed.  It doesnt taste like 10.5% ABV.  World class and awesome.  Another truly spectacular brew from Unibroue!","Orange Park, Florida, USA","yayforbeer"
2269,"2006-03-14",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 23, 2006 Pours a deep dark brown color, fully sedimented and cloudy with a giant light brown frothy head that shows medium retention.
Aroma is strong and spicy with predominant malt and yeast and notes of coffee, caramel, coriander and cask wood. Very complex.
Flavor is moderately sweet and strongly bitter with a bold initial attack and an awesome and powerfull finish. It develops new flavors with warming. Taste is as complex as the aroma.
Good thick mouthfeel with a syrupy consistence and a long finish. Well disguised alcohol. Overall its a great, complex and well balanced example of a Belgian Strong Ale.

When held to the light, deep mahogany hues shine through this dark and wonderful ale. The nose on this beer is fantastic, with big aromas of fruity and spicy yeast, roasty dark malts, sweet malt, and peppery alcohol. The palate is firm on the tongue with lots of big sweet malty and fruity flavors, paired with roasted barley notes, and most spicy yeast flavors that dance on the tongue. Terrible finishes with more sweet malt, fruit, and yeasty spice up front, then ends with a soothing, warming, peppery burn that lingers. 

Yet another world class brew from Quebecs Unibroue. Clearly this brewery is one of the best on the planet, and they truly rival the Belgians, when it comes to brewing up styles like Terrible, which is based on a Belgian Abbey Ale. It can be enjoyed young, or cellared like a fine wine, and can be aged for a number of years. Terrible is marketed in corked 750 ml brown bottles that retail for $6-$7, in the good beer stores where it is sold. It is a perfect dark ale to sip and enjoy on a cold winters night, and works very well with hearty dishes, or strong and sharp cheeses. Try it with a Montreal classic, a ""Smoked Meat"" sandwich, or perhaps roast beef, or prime rib.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

2269,"2006-01-22",3.8,"750 mL corked bottle; stored for an estimated 3 to 4 months sitting on top of the refrigerator in a light-exposed wine rack, sideways.  Pours a deep, dark purple/ruby with a large but quickly dissipating light brown, creamy but fizzy head.  Aroma is suspectly Unibroue-ish like every one of their beers Ive had to date; yeast, dark fruits, dark malt, and detectable alcohol.  Flavor is similarly dark but with some sharp, bright sweetness; alcohol is not present in the flavor, but it warms the throat and stomach and the nose during exhale; finish is just a tough flat (kind of like Diet Coke) with a lingering, slightly bland aftertaste.  Like every Unibroue, its too fizzy and it froths up in the mouth to create a huge but thin mass of bubbles; this makes it feel too thin, yet the sugariness makes it too sticky.  Overall, this is a solid beer and a good Belgian; much better is available, however.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sfontain"

The 10.5% is well balanced and unobtrusive but quite warming and stealth. Finishes sweet and slick, but in no way cloying.

I thought that I could, perhaps, force it to repent its wicked ways.  Not only did this Unibroue beer seem arrogant, but its neck was a dark gothic spire and its attitude dark and brooding.  It was harboring a secret, rubbing its hands around a bloody knife or binding its mouth from telling secrets.  An uncorking cum exorcism did nothing but serve my nostrils adumbration of the flavor.  Nothing to do then, but serve myself a generous cup of this devilish liquid and make what I can of it.  The liquids edges (if such things are real) glow with a bloody red when held to light, and relax when brought back to shadow.  The smell performs a slow and mournful twist, intimating vegetables and dark fruits.  Inside the beer itself lies a supine collection of deep flavors like, raisin, molasses, malts, and wood.  Most comforting among these tastes was a lone hero, a glimmer of yellow light in a cubic sea, a cavalier apple-wood taste that shone through when the sheer weight of the darker flavors threatened to mass together and bury me.  These flavors, even when pushed away by the chivalric apple-wood, hardly move.  The beer is macabre by its personality, and any vibrant displays on its part could be interpreted either as a brewmasters fluke or an odd case of an undead beer  curiously still, but characterized by episodic fits of bright, shining flavor.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
2269,"2005-10-10",4.1,"[22 oz. bottle] Pours a creepy black color, with barely any carbonation at all. At first, I was wondering if something was wrong. Then, once I tasted it, I was greeted with strong malt and alcohol flavors, along with raisins, cloves, coffee and dark chocolate. One hardly gets overpowered by the 10.5% ABV. This is definitely an interesting beer from Unibroue. Im glad to have it as my 100th rating.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","BitchesBrew"
2269,"2005-10-09",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2005 The ominous darkness of this bottle promised an exciting reviewing session. I was not let down by the pour: a sinister black hue topped of a fizzy tan crown that dissipated quickly into the void. A foreboding atmosphere accompagnies the first whiff. Many aromas intertwine and interact as you inspect the nose. Dark malts and fruits echo each other and call for a sip. I resisted as I could, and tried to analyze all these sensations. Roasted coffee, dark chocolate and oak dominate the background while blackberries, raspberries and apples mingle with salted butter, biscuits and toast. The first taste was surprisingly uneventful. Very few of the fragrances I had recognized were noticeable and a large malt profile seemed to quench all pretenders. Roasted sugars and coffee reign terribly over the flavor of this brew giving it a stout-like quality. The mouthfeel is slightly redeemed by the velevety smooth palate that finishes dry and salty. I was a bit disappointed by the second part of this beer - maybe I was expecting too much. Not my favorite Unibroue.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Smells to me like all the Beligian beers basically smell like, but with a darker/smokier hint. Tastes just great, like a strong Belgian crossed with a sweet stout (if that sounds great to you...). Some harshness fades as it warms up. I could drink this all day, but then Id be dead, cuz its strong, or at least broke, cuz I think this was about $10/750 ml bottle at the ""discount"" store at Foster and Clark.

God I love my Duvel tulip, shows this beer off to perfection...deep black with a huge tan head which slowly dimishes leaving plenty of lace. Vinous, fruity, funky aroma giving a subtle hint of things to come. Flavour is oak, dried fruit, plums, port; very well balanced, not too sweet not to dry, very little bitterness, and almost no evidence of the 10.5% ABV. I am a big fan of high ABV beers that hide it well. Palate complements the flavours, but is not quite to De Dolle standards. If I was capable of drinking this all night, I would!

The cork resoundingly revealed a still very lively beer at 9 months, maybe the ample carbonation was now smoother. This time Terrible had nice underpinnings of wine-like flavor, sort of a young Moulin-A-Vent like sugariness and an almost Pino Noir-ish grapey/dark berry thing going on. Powerful and integrated, not astringent but quite more-ish. I was impressed. <P> I wonder if the temperature had a big effect, or the slight extra ageing, or if the bottles were not equally good... or if my expectations got in the way. I will grab a few more to gauge consistency.

OLD RATING 7/4/5/3/13
Bomber cellared 6 mos. Pours yeasty dark brown with nice, fine head activity. Yeast and soft spice aroma. Flavor profile is undefined and odd to me, perhaps b/c alcohol does assert itself where rich notes of fruit are fighting to express - they seem a bit defeated. Hints of lemon rind and cola emerge and vanish. Long off-dry malty finish. Slightly peppery feel from carbonation. This brew has a sweet body but slightly astringent feel, I cant quite get it. Hmm...  noteworthy but not a standout Uni-Belgian for me.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DerWeg"

Overall I like the flavors better than a brown ale - much more depth. A slight alcohol bite is present although for 10.5%, it is not intrusive. The palate for me left a little to be desired for such a complex flavor and aroma.  Medium body, almost-flat carbonation, and a quick finish. Overall Im fairly impressed with this beer.

2269,"2005-07-14",2.5,"Terrible indeed...I suppose I should start with the positive and say that it really is a beautifully presented bottle. In terms of a score the beauty of the bottle certainly evens out the ugliness of the beer itself. Theres barely any pressure to push the cork out and I have to pour from quite a distance to get it to form any head, which doesnt last at all anyway, quickly reducing to some fine white wisps like cirrus on an otherwise clear day (oh dear, am I turning into MartinT?) The liquid is a weird black colour with more browny-grey highlights than red, though in a wine glass it looks a whole lot like red wine from a distance. Aroma? Theres surprisingly little for a beer thats 10.5%. Obviously the toasted sugar, pears and stinky esters of the house yeast is there but even that is restrained. It vaguely hints at both a red wine and Flemish sour ale character but never really delivers on either. Some vanilla, but really the only thing that makes it seem like its 10.5% is the alcohol. Surprisingly thin and lifeless body - I usually dont complain about beers being on the low end of carbonation but I reckon in this case it would have given the beer a bit of vibrancy and brought out a little more character. Lightly sugary-sweet, milky flavour with more toasted sugar notes. I like how they get it dark without any dark malt character, but theres just not a lot else there. Its headily alcoholic too. Its not bad beer as such (though it did have some elements I didnt like), but for a beer of such a reputation (not to mention $18) this really should at least have more flavour, and preferably good flavour. I really should have learned my lesson with Unibroue by now...","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

The aroma is rather reserved - vinous berries and a little vanilla woodiness.

The flavor is also vinous and sherry like with a sweet malt backbone underneath.  Theres some plums, woodiness and pepper.  The finish is tart fruity alcohol.  It is medium to full bodied, not much carbonation but what there is is rather harsh.

Overall, I was a little disappointed with this.  It is well made (nothing offensive about it) but a little too wine-like for me.  It is surprisingly drinkable and hides the alcohol well (until it kicks you in the butt later).","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"

The flavor has a robust spicy note of maduro wrapped cigar and black pepper, and again, that clove hits you in the finish.

This is easily one of the most drinkable Belgian Strongs Ive had.

This beer is soft in flavor and is more the type in which you have to actively search out the subtlies to find any real depth of flavor. The alcohol is almost undetectable. The palate is medium but fades to thin on the finish.

Deep, dark red-black color, some light tinges of mahogany when they are  searched for, and with a fine, creamy, lasting off-white head.  Brown sugary sweetness and a depth of spices greet the palate, subsequently giving way to a profoundly vinous maltiness while the intriguing finish sees a conjunction of fruity yeast, the omnipresent spiciness, peppery alcohol, milk chocolate, toffeeish sweetness, dark, faintly grainy breadiness and tinges of citrus, raisin and carob.  Moderately acidic palate, lightly bitter, with a smooth, creamily effervescent and rich mouthfeel.  Somewhat warming, an appropriate cold-weather selection.

Taste is rich, mouthfeel is filled, but the texture is surprisingly thin. The palate/aftertaste seems to dissolve, but a warming alcohol sensation keeps going on. My wife finds an aftertaste as from malt that has been left lying too long. I cannot quite disagree... This is weird.

Thick, somewhat loose dark cocoa brown head that builds a bit over bundantly, even with a slow pour. Very little lace appears and/or sticks. Aroma is yeasty spiced, cloves and peppery with a light dark fruit-like sweetness and light toffee with a nudge of roasty maltyness. Overall mostly sweet at first but the yeast dominates as it warms. Taste is about what I've come to expect out of these Belgian style dark ales with dark fruity sweetness of some raisin and plum upfront, quick full on spice at the middle with a touch of hops, subsides just as quick to a toffee sweetness and leaves trails of clove and other dark fruits of banana and dark roastyness that lingers with a subdued dryness and yeasty texture in the finish. Mellow but full mouthfeel with some solid carbonation, could be smoother, a little rough around the edges, but gets easier to handle as it warms. A good representation of the style, not to overpowering really, just the right amount of yeast and sweet malts, but lacks some complexity.

Nose has some roasty, chocolate notes with some definite anise present.  There are also lots of dried fruits, raisins.  I detect a slight touch of what appears to be cardboardy oxidation.  Mildly transparent dark mahogany color with a disappointingly small light tan head that is listless and quickly dissipating.  This may be due to the age of the bottle, though.

The finish is sweet, perhaps slightly too much so, and vinous, with a lot of alcohol warmth but also remarkably smooth for a for a beer this big.  It's not quite the ecstasy of of a Westvleteren 12 or a Rochefort 10 but it's certainly in that territory and even more rich, the equal of Chimay Grande Reserve.

Deep, clear black with hints of brown.  Fizzy tan head settles to a thin, but complete, cap.  Nose is soda bread, faint toffee, some spiciness, and the distinctive Unibroue yeast.  Small suggestion of dark fruits.  Starts out a bit thin and fizzy, with much more fruitiness than what was detectable in the aroma.  Good balance between the flavors, which include toffee, spice, soda bread, licorice, bananas, raisons, and black currants.  Not overly complex, but still good.  Pleasant, lengthy finish, with barely a hint of the hefty alcohol content.  A strong acidic undercurrent combines with the brisk carbonation that is slow to fade for a sharp mouthfeel thats a bit too thin.

Nicely full bodied and creamy up front, a smooth malty mouth and this is aggressively followed by candy sugar and hops, a bit of smoke and fermenting black fruits along for a ride.

Medium bodied, lush in mouth, slightly tart, smooth, dark candied sugars, plummy, pruney, yeast character evident along with corriander and maybe a smidge of grains of paradise as it warms.

I can't tell the difference between any Belgian beers...they all taste and smell like spicy bananas!  This beer was slightly better because it was 10.5% ABV and it masked it very well.  I'm not sure why everybody goes crazy over these spicy banana Belgian beers.  They are ALL the same!  I keep trying Belgian beers to see if I can find one that tastes like anything other than bananas.  To date, I have found no such animal.  It reminds me of the bubblegum that used to come in the Monkees music group trading cards in the 1960's.  This lived up to it's name!","Ocala, Florida, USA","mribm"

Alcohol, candi sugar, and dark fruit in the aroma, which was pleasant but not strong.  Rich flavor: dark fruit, vinous notes, apple cider, candi sugar, a touch of banana, and alcohol.  Nonetheless, this beer finished somewhat dry, not being cloying in any regard.  Perfect carbonation and mouthfeel- one of the smoothest high ABV beers I've ever sampled.

I'm not a big Unibroue fan but this is really good. Flavor has spicy yeast notes at the front with dark fruitiness and some banana/clove weizen-ness to it.

2269,"2003-10-24",4.4,"Opens with a strong pop and a big whiff of yeasty deliciousness. Deep purple color. Upon pouring the loudly crackling head is vibrant with large bubbles. This head diminish quickly then regrows(!) to a quarter inch of gray foam. It's all very entertaining.
<P>Nose is strong with that magnificent Unibroue yeast punch. Rich cloves, banana, plum, and nutmeg are around every corner. Full bodied but not overly thick. Carbonation adds a gentle cushion upon which sits an inimitable candi sugar sweetness. Yeast is most predominant in the flavor as it is in the aroma.
This is really just wonderful--a well balanced, complex mix of sweet, spicy, and bitter with just a touch of alcohol warmth in the belly. As good as anything coming out of Belgium.

This brew poured a large head of foamy fine to medium sized off-white colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a semi-opaque dark brown colored body.  The aroma came off to me as yucky and hard to describe.  I did not much care for that aspect of this brew.  The mouthfeel was smooth and started off dryly while finishing a bit more mildly.  I did not take many notes on it at this point as I was kind of turned off by it and my final comment on the flavor was, ""Not great"".

Some fruit, spice, again the usual Unibroue fare.  A week after I recieved this in a trade I saw it here in IL and WI, at least my label is in French.

Smells of lots of candied sugar, some ripe plums, maybe a touch of maple and alcohol?
Begins with a ton of malt and lots of candied sugar flavor.  Wow, this is sweet.  Evens somewhat, with some banana and bubblegum esters, but the hops punch Im hoping for never hits.  The body is surprisingly only medium, maybe slightly medium full.  Loose, somewhat watery texture, very soft.  Finish improves however, with some drier alcohol notes and finally some hops and yeast.  Still, the finish just dosent seem to make up for the way too sugary beginning and watery body.  I want to be harsh on this beer, as I was let down by the cloyingness it provided towards the end of the bottle, but the finish showed potential.  The flavor would even with cellaring, but I have to wonder about the watery smooth mouthfeel, would that hold up?  I felt carbonation level was perhaps too low, did not find it to be overcarbed even up front.  Im going to have to say overrated now, but lets see how cellaring goes. . .","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Virtually no lacing is left on the glass, either. Good raosted malt aromas are coupled with strong fruitiness. Black raspberry coupled with fresh grape jelly. The taste is also dark and fruity with a very solid malt component. Mild bitterness leads to a smooth finish with a hint of anise in the aftertaste. A very nice beer.","McMurray, Pennsylvania, USA","aaronh"
2269,"2003-10-11",3.6,"Very dark brown liquid under a lasting tan head.  Roasted grain aroma when chilled that dissipates to a spicy, yeasty plum, and sweet grainy malt as it warms.  Sweetly malty upon first sip, then alcohol flavor w/a light plum fruitiness and hop flavor that lasts into the aftertaste.  There is a yeasty spicyness as well, and fairly well balanced, but far less complex that I would have imagined.  Higher carbonation leaves a lighter mouthfeel of the medium body, but the alcohol is a little hot.  Not quite burning, but you know it's there.  Overall I'm disappointed with this beer.  Maybe it's  a little young, but this is the first beer I've had from Unibroue that I couldn't drink a lot of right now.  To me it lacks depth and complexity that I find in their other beers.

2269,"2003-10-10",3.4,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2015 Bottle (BB Sep 15, 2018). Head is initially average sized, fizzy/frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing. Body is dark brown, bottle conditioned.

Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

Overall a decent brew but as with pretty much all Unibroue beers, lacking real depth, heart, and character.  Theyre workman-like Belgian brews, and fairly authentic for this kind of thing, but they take no chances or show any real soul.  This is a little better than the bulk of the brewerys output, reasonably enticing, balanced, and enjoyable, but ultimately still limited and lacking.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2269,"2003-10-08",4.1,"Opaque brown with a slow dissipating shiny light tan head. Dry toasty malt aroma, with undertones of blackberries, red currants, signature yeast and slight hint of wintergreen and alcohol. Smooth across the tongue with plenty of bubbles escaping as it slides back. Black malt finish, I start at the finish because it was quite evident after the first quaff, I like it, a change from the norm. Light licorice start with various berries and pepper. Somewhat acidic finish but nothing to overbearing.  Serve this to some wine snob and have them compare it to a fine hearty zinfandel.  To heck with the aperitif/digestif, consume with a 16 oz. filet au poivre.

Has a spicy Belgian aroma as well as a hint of alcohol in the nose.  Lightly sweet with notes of of burnt raisin and some dried plum in the taste.  It has a hint of acidity to it that is slightly reminiscent of cranberries.  Fairly soft in character, it is a well integrated beer that is balanced very well between the competing elements.  There is a certain spiciness here that seems to be a product of the various higher alcohols, the ethanol is here as well, in the finish.  This is a very light beer for 10.5%, even if it is by volume.  I do like this beer, but I feel that it could improve quite a bit if it were cellared for a few years.
Sampled September 2003The aroma is good, I smell rum, raisin and dark malt.  This is a very light bodied beer, a great example of the light bodied Belgian beer style that will sneak up on you if you are not careful.  The beer is pretty dry but there is a bit of sweetness that adds to the complexity of this brew.  There is a hint of chocolate malt, a raisin flavor, and it finishes with a bit of alcohol.

Whoa - what a complex aroma, some fig/raisin notes, I guess they used a tad of Special B malt...but its not dominant, in fact there is no one dominant aroma component.  Other notes include sweet sherry and vinous flavors, a little whiskey, (not smoky, but maybe woody).  Flavor is similar: vinous, dry sherry, rich round sweetness followed by a nicely dry finish.  Warming in the mouth, not so much in the chest.  Full rich flavor, with more fig and raisin and other fruit.  Finish is clean and light, not too much alcohol - in fact it hides it all too well, making this deceptively drinkable and intoxicating.  Near perfect but I'm bringing it down a tad just because its overall potency of flavor and richness detract a bit from its drinkability.  Curious sidenote: the dry lingering alcohol burn reminded me of drinking vodka, and paired with the rich sweetness up front, made me crave a more savory vodka drink like a Bloody Mary.

Try as I might, was unable to find any alcohol present in the nose.  The effervescence make the mouth laugh with delight.  The flavor really shows the maltiness, but also brings out some sweet fruits as well.  Again, the alcohol is almost completely hidden.  Incredibly smooth, sweet fruit dipped in chocolate and again in caramel is reduced into a teaspoon.  The finish brings about the only signs of alcohol, a warming belly.  The shear experience of drinking this finest of concoctions is very near that of gnosis.  Many deepest thanks to radiomgb for my initiating this most recent religious experience.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

The aroma was pretty alcoholic with yeast and spices becoming very apparent, ginger perhaps. Literally, one whiff of this decimated my nose for about a minute as the burn attacked my nose. The taste does not make much attempt to hide the alcohol, but luckily there is just SO much going on in the flavor department that this isnt too much of a problem. Spices (ginger) and deep malts dominate this brew along with a good ingrained citrusness and something fruity. The spiceyness of this brew actually grew considerably as it warmed and so did the complexities of the beast.

Poured a thin, beige frothy head that dissipated much quicker than most of the Unibroue collection. The body is a near opaque, cloudy, deep rudy-brown. Though the head has dissipated, this beer remains quite a lively carbonation. Trance setting aroma of malt, strong citrus and port. Stunning and complex flavours. Tastes of port, oak, fruit and velvet smooth malt. Deliteful finish of floral, cola with little of the Unibroue alcohol burn. Truly a special Belgian Strong. My favourite of the Unibroue offerings and likely best represents the complex nature and flavours of Belgian Strong ales on this side of the ocean. Near perfect!","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
2269,"2003-02-11",4.4,"This beer rocks!
It pours a murky deep rust hue. Medium-sized, frothy, khaki-colored head diminishes slightly. However, the head transforms into a fully lasting, very small creamy head.
The aroma is to be cherished. Malty with notes of tawny port, prunes, buttermilk and caramel. The Belgian candy sugar isn't as pronounced in the nose as with many dubbels/abbey styles. There is actually a slight floral presence in the nose. Hops? In a Belgian?
Yep, they come through in the flavor. Up front, this ale is all about rich malt with bursts of red wine, dark fruits, milk chocolate, alcohol, caramel and cola. However, on the backside, the flavor is both bitter and pungent from some type of actual hop addition. Who allowed hops into Belgium...ok, into Canada? God bless them.
Just a hint of light buttermilk on the backside as well.
Full-bodied with a very creamy mouthfeel and lively carbonation.
Long, acrid, dry finish with some woodsy notes thrown in.
What a beer. Another very strong offering from Unibroue. I have yet to be disappointed by this brewery.

2269,"2003-01-12",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2003 It takes a lot to shut up a table of beer freaks.  When we originally got a bottle of this last winter, that's exactly what happened!  After the cork popped and it was poured - almost black with hints of brown and purple,  a medium sized tan head that made sizzling snap crackle and pop sounds - silence overcame us as we took a moment to sniff the dark fruit aroma.  This actually gave me shivers down my spine, Rockinout John had goosebumps, and Chris just sat there stunned and smiling.

Dark fruits are here - plums/raisins, along with hints of anise, chocolate, - but there's so much more going on at the same time. No one flavor dominates, everything blends together smoothly - alcohol was very well hidden, mostly warming the throat on the way down. Finishes sticky and slightly sweet, lingering.

2269,"2003-01-04",4.9,"A stunning beer in the same tradition of Chimays Grand Reserve (blue cap), it offers everything that the Belgian classic has with just a darker tone and a more affordable price. BC-LDB currently stocks this at $7.95cdn per 750ml bottle -- and this one is honestly worth every penny. 
<P>
Having tasted my fair share of Belgian styled brews over the past several years, Chimays Grand Reserve was and will still remain my current all time favorite, but Unibroues latest Terrible (an Abbey Style) dark brown ale pegged at 10.5% abv is an extremely strong contender that deserves a close look by fellow Belgian styled enthusiasts. New to market, or at least to my eyes, Terrible is the easy front runner on the Unibroue product schedule suprassing fellow label mates Don de Dieu and La Maudite.
<P>
Terrible is another exceptional offering from Unibroue that is very drinkable and a great brew to relax with.
