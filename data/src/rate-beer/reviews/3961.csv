3961,"2017-06-17",4.3,"Po otwarciu butelki bucha chmiel; żywica, iglaki i co nieco ze strony słodowej: czekolada deserowa i trochę kawy. Jest intensywnie, ale nienachalnie. Po przelaniu do szkła chmiel na pierwszym planie, intensywne aromaty leśne, lekko wpadające w ziemistość, tuż za chmielem wyraźniejsza kawa i kakao. W smaku balans przesunięty na stronę chmielową, stylowo, ale słody nadają tu pełni i gładkości. Żywica, trochę paloności w stronę prażonego słonecznika, kawa (czuć, że jest w składzie, a nie pochodzi tylko od słodów), posmak kakao dobrze gra tu z chmielem, po ogrzaniu dochodzi nieco więcej czekolady. Goryczka w punkt, średnio-wysoka, ale mega szlachetna, przyjemna, bez uczucia ściągnia, niemal 10% alko również ukryte perfekcyjnie.

Szóval néha el-elfogyasztok belőlük egyet, de semmi több, mondhatni, az olyan darabok viszont, mint ez a mai, könnyebben változtathatnak ezen a hozzáálláson, olyannyira rendben van a főzet.

Elsőre a szegfűs, karcosabb komlós hangulat tör elő aromák formájában, majd egyre komplexebb lesz az illatszerkezet, imperial portert idéző marcipán, stoutos pörköltség, édeskés kávé képe rajzolódik ki, majd simul mindinkább egybe. Szerkezete szinte tökéletes, olajos, haraphatóan telt és izgalmas, miután az illatjegyek által megelőlegezett tartalmat gond nélkül beváltja az ízvilág.

 Kolor:  Czarny, od spodu szkła tylko delikatne ciemnobrązowe prześwity. 
 Piana:  Genialna! Ciemnokremowa, wysoka, hiper-drobno-pęcherzykowa, ubita i trwała jak na azocie. Musiałem trochę odczekać po pierwszym nalaniu, aby uzupełnić Tumbler kolejną porcją piwa. Bardzo powoli redukuje się. Pozostawia na ściankach szkła liczne firanki. Warto docenić tutaj pianę, gdyż lacing jest wręcz doskonały. 
 Zapach:  Ślicznie pachnie. Pierwsze skojrzenia są żywiczne, sosnowe, potem tony prażonego słonecznika.
Zaraz po tym subtelna paloność i odrobina kawy.
Nie brakuje tutaj również ciemnych owoców.
W dalekim tle przemknęła delikatna morska nuta, jakby odrobina słonej morskiej wody.
Po mocniejszym zamieszaniu szkłem znowu powraca żywica, sosna i słonecznik.

Szukam cały czas tych grudek soli. Odnajduję je po chwili oblizując podniebienie. Pozornie niewyczuwalne, osiadają na podniebieniu i dopiero po oblizaniu się czuć ten słony smak.
Po kilku kolejnych łykach zadziałała autosugestia i pojawił się posmak tych kryształków soli, które znajdują się na słonych paluszkach, czy też skojarzenie z obwarzankami krakowskimi z dużą ilością soli.
Niesamowite doznanie.
Warto zwrócić także uwagę na nieprawdopodobną wręcz teksturę piwa.
Trunek przypomina raczej gęsty czarny budyń, lub kisiel.

Doskonałe zatuszowanie alkoholu.

Sticky honey on the tongue right away. Mead-like mouthfeel. Thick and syrupy. Light carbonation. Good hoppy finish with proud bitter hops help to balance the malty gravitas. Surprisingly light experience for what is advertised as a black coffee IPA and drinks like imperial stout or strong monks ale. The hops are what gives it away since the overall palate is hop-balanced.

Other flavor notes predictably evoke descriptors like toasty, roasted, caramel, chocolate, treacle, peat, tobacco.

3961,"2015-03-06",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2015 This renowned Danish beer company apparently made this beer at Belgiums Proefbrouwerij. Coffee has been added to this black IPA, but I hope the ""body salt"" is to be taken merely metaphorically, as a symbol of the hard work that got into it... Lets not think about that body sweat and subject this beer to an objective tasting. Deep yellowish beige, thick and moussy, lacing head over a black liquid, leaving only a faint impression of dark mahogany around the edges. Complex, inviting aroma of espresso and roasted coffee beans, bitter chocolate, pine wood, whisky, caramel, dried plum, cream, some smoked meat and fried bacon, drop (liquorice candy), leather, blood, black pepper, Cuban cigar tobacco, cloves. Dense and demanding taste profile, starting off with candied figs, raisins and walnuts, subduedly sweetish with a clear salty touch persisting till deep into the finish (Im beginning to hope this is the familiar hops saltiness I remember from all those IPAs and not the symbolically added body sweat salt...); soft carbonation with thick, fatty, creamy mouthfeel, pointy sourish accent appearing as well but remaining quiet, after which a deep maltiness unfolds, with layers of bitter chocolate, nuts and caramel, becoming ever more coffee-ish towards the end, with a fairly strong and somewhat perfumey retronasal effect of dried spices (especially liquorice) and dried fruits, finishing explicitly but complexely bittering and drying, with peppery, earthy and resinous hop bitterness blending with a coffee-like, mouth-filling roasted maltiness, a subtle hint of smokiness as well as a hint of warming, liqueurish alcohol and lingering caramelly malt sweetness. Complex and quite severe, this is a lovely salty-bitter, fascinating brew, the taste of which will remain with me for quite a long time. Nevertheless, seeing its score here, I cant help having expected a bit more from it and its just a tad too salty for me to fully enjoy its complexity - but still, a great piece of work.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3961,"2015-01-28",4.6,"Zawsze mam obawy, kiedy sięgam po piwo uznane przez innych za rewelacyjne. 100/100 na ratebeer - tłum nie może się mylić... Jednak wtedy oczekiwania są wysokie i nie zawsze jest tak jakbym chciał... Kiedy zobaczyłem piwo w szkle już byłem zadowolony - piękna, czarna barwa i świetna wysoka, pomimo dużej mocy piwa, piana. I ta barwa! Beżowa - piękna! Cudowny zapach kawy i cytrusów zachęcał do jak najszybszego pierwszego łyku. I tu nastąpiła chwila zawahania, gdyż przez moment smak nie zrobił na mnie wrażenia! Dopiero po chwili, gdy przez przełyk przeleciała kolejna porcja trunku, było świetnie. Tu kawa przerodziła się w mocne espresso, a moc piwa objawiała się tylko poprzez przyjemne pieczenie w gardle. Nie wyczułem soli, która miała być tu dodatkiem... Na koniec ważna sprawa - rewelacyjna, zrównoważona, niezalegająca goryczka - wszystko niemalże idealnie!

Colore bruno scuro, quasi nero, con un bel cappello di schiuma color nocciola, pannoso, persistente non molto a lungo. Gli aromi di malto tostato e caffè sono molto intensi al naso, con frutta secca e acida(prugne) e legna bruciata alla fine. Stessi aromi riproposti in bocca, ben presente il caffè, dosato in maniera originale e perfetta. Sfumature di carciofo al palato, immediatamente prima del luppolo che conquista il palato, ancora insieme al caffè. Corposa al punto giusto, carbonazione medio-bassa. Finale secco (anche se dopo un po arriva una leggera e piacevole astringenza) e lungo, complesso. Il sale marino crea in bocca un senso di movimento, che quasi ricorda i mari del Nord.

The strong flavour is more hop-driven than the aroma, with initial notes of tropical fruits and grapefruit and more subdued roasted notes of coffee and chocolate. In the long-lasting quite heavy bitter finish I get plenty of pine and flowers.

Moderate to high slightly resinous hop bitterness lingers along with the coffee roast in the dry and ashy finish, a little hint of fruit from the hops remains. Moderate slick body with medium carb. Super pairing of coffee and big imperial black IPA characters, the coffee helps keep the beer quite dry and bitter and even slighlty astringent at times but it never tastes overly burnt.

A good attenuation makes this beer so drinkable though its alcohol content and its mellow velvety texture. Every single sip is different from the following one: its an american stout, its an IPA, its an american stout, its an IPA and so on... The aftertaste is that of an imperial stout: a bit astringent, some caramel and long lasting. Guys, this beer is a little masterpiece!

3961,"2014-04-21",4.6,"Fantasic brown head, tar black color. Bready malts, coffee, ripe fruits, mango, peach, a whole lot going on in this, while fruit aromas are the most present.

Taste is much more defined by coffee, as the smell actually promised. Coffee is so intense, it reminds me of espresso, providing a bitter, dry beginning. Bitter chocolate and earthy malts support the bitter, present coffee, providing a underlying sweet- and earthieness. Fruits are also present, giving the beer a great complexity. Fruits turn more and more recognizable, as the palate adjusts to the beer. Surprisingly, those two very different tastes go very well together. Bitter from the beginning, fruity hops add a lovely piny, sweet note to the beer, with a gentle bitter, hoppy ending. Mouthfeel is almost a little oily. Great melange, full bodied, neither coffee nor fruits seem to be too present on their own, which makes this beer so great for me. Both sides of the beer would work perfectly fine on their own, but thrown into one single bottle, a unique enjoyable taste is created. Very smooth, warm, gentle, while alcohol is detectable at no point.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Finishes with some piney bitterness but the aftertaste still brings a malty sweetness. I think I would like this better if it was fresher. The hops have faded which allows the malt to come off to sweet and syrupy. Full body. Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Definitely intense and interesting.

Pours into my tulip in an opaque deep brown with a voluptuous tan head. The aroma is a trip. Ashy coffee mingles with the intense spicy pine of simcoe hops (I had to look that up, wouldnt have called it at all in that the tropical fruit just isnt there for me.). Hint of apricot. Sassafras. Flavor is cafe mocha up front with vanilla, some salt on the lips, mouth-drying hops and a touch of wood through the middle, and back to espresso aftertaste on the long end. Smooth creamy milkshake mouthfeel, this one has absolutely zero hint of its formidable alcohol content. Its a very interesting beer, lovely on the tongue, layering quite a decent black IPA snap behind the aroma of a charred imperial stout, and fascinating to unpack. Certainly not as thirst-quenching as my ideal black IPA would be.

After the Molotov mouthfuck Ive just endured, this is quite mild, and quite balanced. Not getting the IPA aspect so much, but thats OK, I think that IPA + coffee is a fucking awful combination generally. Fullish palate, leaves a nice truffley finish, complete with the powdered cocoa. Probably an overrate, but Im recoilling from Evil Twin horrors. As the molotov gets more distant, if anything this tastes better, popping up its score a little.

3961,"2014-01-03",3.8,"0,33 l bottle from Kihoskh, København. A dark brown to black pour, topped by a finger of dense light brown head. Well roasted coffee-beans, black choco, and a good amount of fruity and resiny hops in the aroma. Creamy texture, full body. Taste is not as heavily roasted as feared. Distinct, but balanced with fine choco and coffee tones. A bold fruity bitterness shines through, and linger in a lasting malty-bitter finish. Could easily be labelled as an Imperial Porter.

Palais est sympa et offre une petite alternance avec cet ajout de café. Ce dernier accompagne bien le côté malté grillé et caramel. Le tout avec des notes de citronné voire de pamplemousse. Le café apporte un petit plus pour une bière qui reste sans cela une Black Ipa basique et qui ici aussi aurait pu avoir juste une peu moins dalcool.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

Overall, a roasted, almost burned hop aroma - nice! 
First impression on the palate is a very dark malted, bitter, coffee-like flavor. It then moves into a nice, cleaner, simpler malt profile and finishes with an aftertaste thats definitely dominated by a bitter citrus hop flavor. Mouthfeel is bigger side of medium thanks to the oats and dry. Not an insanely coffee forward black IPA in the beginning, but as it gets warmer, the coffee is more present for sure.

All this is very well rounded with the high abv, some burned sugar and fruity notes from both the coffee and the slightly exotic fruits from the hops.
