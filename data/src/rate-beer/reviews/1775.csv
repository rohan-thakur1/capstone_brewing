1775,"2015-01-15",3.6,"Bomber. So, this is an homage to Negra Models, eh? My favorite cerveza Mexicana... (and in a pinch, I once used the foil from a bottle of said Grupo beer to craft a makeshift roach clip while driving through a Peloponnesian mountain range in Greece... so thats is a tall order Gigantic!) Ok, so... pours a hazy, medium umber color, creamy tannish head with solid retention and lacing. Nose is big caramel and brown sugary notes, dried fruit (figs and dates mainly), deep malty character and a hint of butterscotch. Mouth is medium bodied, mildly sweet, creamy and chock full of everything I just pointed out in the nose, finishes slightly bitter and a hint of metallic-ness, but thats the only knock. So, this doesnt have the clean finish of Modelo, or the macro sterility of said producto de cerveceria... but fuck, man, this is miles better than the beer its made in tribute to. Gigantico... tu eres muy chingon, guey!!","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"

1775,"2014-01-25",3.3,"Bomber at BD Aberdeen. It pours hazy orange-amber with a thick off-white head. The nose is candy, orange sponge cake, fruit cake, dried fruits and brown sugar. The taste is orange sponge cake, muffin, earth, dough, citrus peel, dried fruit and light toast with a bitter-sweet finish. Medium body and fine carbonation. Scoopable, but not a whole lot going on.

Taste is of sweet fruit, chiles, biscuity malts and bread. Lowly carbonated with some alcohol presence. Medium bodied. Finishes quite sweet with light fruits. Shrug?

1775,"2013-11-10",3.2,"Rich ruby and orange tinted coloured body with a thin, one centimetre tall tan head with a perfect tint. Aroma of nice chewy, earthy malt, good rich caramel, toffee and a bit of a pear and apple scent at the end. Medium-bodied; Super mild malty flavour with some hints of figs, raisins and toffee and a very light spiciness. Aftertaste is super mild with only a handful of sweetness coming through and very little else, perhaps some fruit notes, but thats it. Overall, a very mild and relatively unimpressive beer - nothing offensive, but nothing truly flavourful and nothing after a few seconds into the taste. I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Made in Oregon in Portland, Oregon (PDX Terminal D) on 28-September-2013 for US$5.50 sampled at home in Washington a few minutes before leaving back for Portland on 10-November-2013.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

Flavor is malty, but there seems to be a lot of something, hopefully hop, that is keeping it fairly dry. Not very bitter, just that theres a large lump of flavor thats not malt.

1775,"2013-06-19",3.4,"Pours a very clean amber color with a low, white head. Aroma is very fruity with notes of apple, mild pear, light grapes and some late toasted Vienna malt. Flavor doesnt have a fruity note to it but does have a very smooth, toasted Vienna flavor with a touch of late chocolate malt. Body is light with a modest amount of fizzy kick to it. Overall a pretty good brew. Was worried a bit by the nose as it was extra fruity but the fruitiness remains confined solely to the nose and fails to dominate the flavor.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"

1775,"2013-06-14",4.2,"You never quite know what you're getting with Gigantic beers, which don't conform to any style per se. This reminds me of a red ale, although it's a lager. Nice malty, slightly spiced backbone, with perhaps a sprinkling of hops on top. Quite flavorful and good. Solid B.

A: Copper colored with a thin ring of white head. Bubbles pop up from the bottom of the glass with good frequency. Looks pleasing.

N: Flavors of malt, some walnut, and a hint of hops. Nothing strong or overly abundant, but it works for the beer.

M: Prickly and very light bodied. Easy to sit back and drink one of these.
