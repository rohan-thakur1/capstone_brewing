3895,"2017-04-29",4.2,"Bottle poured into a snifter showing dark vinous red and crimson pink lacing. 

The nose shows light oak support with a black forest fruit forwardness. Dark and juicy plums and cassis. 

The palate is light bodied and highly carbonated. Highly tart and extremely fruit forward with flavors of fresh juicy ripe raspberries. Dry but slightly obscured by something. Still a great de Garde.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
3895,"2017-01-31",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2017 750mL bottle shared by KBHess on 1/1/17.Light haziness to the cranberry-violet body. Pink/red-tinged beige head atop shows moderate retention.Awesomely integrated fruits in the nose with easygoing lactic acid, black pepper, cherry meat-like notes and very soft oak suggestions. Quite laid back for a De Garde though the big fresh fruit notes are there, just not as jammy as some of their beers. Very aromatic, with a hint of acetic character but mostly tons of raspberry acid and moderate lactic character.The flavor is even better, serving up a funky, fruit-forward, but certainly not sweet character with tight carbonation and a very supple, wheat-heavy texture that allows the acids to sink in and helps soften the sourness. Nicely integrated, with long, berry-heavy flavors lingering and coming back enjoyably retronasal. Couldnt stop drinking the stuff. Another masterful fruited sour!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3895,"2016-12-10",2.8,"Bottle shared with and courtesy of a limping but not too distressed marmot in Deansos garage. Red wine look with a big but short lived purple head. Aroma of big tart dark berries, fairly funky, manure and vinegar. Flavour is heavy sour. Light medium bodied with soft carbonation. So this is number three for the style at the time, but its very far below the J Wakefields.","The Hague / Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","kermis"
3895,"2016-09-21",4.4,"750ml bottle. Gusher - not explosive, but one that just kept coming and coming and coming out of the bottle. That being said, this one looked and tasted fantastic. I would normally knock a beer for gushing, but this one just looked and tasted fantastic. Deep purple with a pink head. Raspberries, berries, jammy, wood, oak, funky, and just all around goodness. Chunky fruits on the side of the glass.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
3895,"2016-09-13",4.5,"From notes. This was shared at a tasting at Guss abode with several participants on September 10. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a dark purple, carrying a light purple head and a light bit of lace as it falls. This is dark and thick looking. The aroma is incredible. There is a huge bright fruit and a jamminess right off the bad. The tartness is right there and keeps it light and sour. I like it. The flavor is really sour up front. The jammy tendency rolls in toward the back end, but this is really a beautiful thing. The sour fruit is just great. The mouth feel is a little syrupy. There is a light crispness to it and a bright carbonation. The aftertaste is all sour and tart raspberries. This is a damn good beer. I love what deGarde is doing here.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Lots of jammy notes, some marzipan, fresh pie berries, almonds, raspberries, lactic tartness, fruit yoghurt, raspberry seeds, weak vanilla and some funk as well! This is one amazing aroma! The taste is at first very raspberry forward in a jammy and juicy way. Behind this you get the classic lactic de grade funk along with some mellow sweeter berry notes and some oak. So many nuances of the raspberries in this beer and the best Ive had from De Garde so far. I really love this brewery.","Aarhus, DENMARK","RasmusOtt"

3895,"2015-07-15",3.5,"[ 75cl Bottle ][ 7oz ][ @tasting ][ $ - ? ][ Tulip ][ 07.14.15 ]Calling this a berliner weisse seems foul. Its a Sour/Wild or Fruit beer given the aggressive citric acid and lack of comparable grain. Gush! Dark grape juice appearance with ruby, large bubbled head. Extremely sour, acidic raspberry nose, sugar muting light seed, acid dominating almost all of it. Front palate softer than expectation, jammy berry sweetness and acid growing early and across mid, tingling heavy before chest burn begins. Fizzy and extremely full by mid palate, muting experience into woody, lightly sweet berry, and heavy acid end.

Taste is medium sour, fresh cranberry, berry medley, encompassing sourness, puckering, beets, seedy raspberry, big citric acid. Spicy, mega juicy berry, light pickled beets as it warms.
