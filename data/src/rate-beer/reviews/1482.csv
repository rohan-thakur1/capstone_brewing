Flavor is a mellow impression, toasted malt. Has brown sugar hints, and a nice milk chocolate, but light. Toasted finish. I love how mellow this beer is up front, but ends on a huge roasted note. Very pleasant porter. A Christmas beer that refuses to be really sweet and excessively added with random stuff. Just the brown sugar, which is perfect for my liking. Bold chocolate.

1482,"2015-07-20",4.4,"Purchased from a liquor store cooler in July 2015. Bottled in 2014 (exact days and month are blurred out). Poured in to a tulip-snifter.

Look - Tan with white swirls in head (like an espresso head). It is thick for the pour with very fine, creamy bubbles. The body is dark black. Head stuck around for a bit and left lacing. Very tasty looking beer. 

Smell - Hoppy and malty. A lot of chocolate and coffee once the hop aroma gives up. There is a smell here I cant identify. I dont know if it is a combination of the hops and chocolate that I dont pick up in a Black IPA. I best describe it as the chewy end of gum that has lost its flavor. 

Taste - No Christmas spice as expected. Chocolate and coffee. Hops linger throughout but not overpowering (maybe because of the late pour). 

Feel - Very creamy but not too heavy. Bitterness does not bite the tongue. No carbonation bomb. 

Overall - This is not a Christmas beer, so I did not get my Christmas in July. This is, however, a beer that is on its way to being a Black IPA but still holds true to everything good in a porter. Thumbs up for the Mexican sugar!","Columbus, Ohio, USA","madelfonatree"

Palate: slick texture, medium body, average to lively carbonation. Overall: not at all what I expected.

There is some light roasted nut smells in the background too, but the smell finally settles on a light spruce and floral smells. A very thick, creamy brown head forms and sticks around for awhile leaving an even blanket of lacing on the way down the glass. This sits atop a dark, opaque coffee color body. It mostly chocolate malt sweet with some very mild coffee bitter notes to it. Its light bodied, mostly flat (although there is some trace carbonation) with a creamy, but slick, feel to it.

Fantastic aromas with great balance of hop and dark roasted malt notes.  Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, grapefruit, pine, floral, char, coffee, caramel, and roasted earthiness.  Good amount of roasted pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, pine, citrus, floral, char, coffee, caramel, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while.  Fantastic balance and complexity of very dark malty flavors with citrus/pine hops; with a great malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish.  Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy, sticky, fairly crisp, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great.  Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish.

Aroma: The nose has some sweet hops, citrus, pine, along with dark malts, coffee, and spice

Appearance: It pours a dark brown color with a small beige head that leaves plenty of drippy lace

Flavor: The malts come out more in the early flavor then they did in the nose, with chocolate and roasted coffee up-front to go along with the plentiful and lingering hop bitterness that shows up later on 

Palate: The body is medium, it has a smooth mouthfeel, soft carbonation, and a dry finish

1482,"2013-01-07",4.2,"Great mouthfeel -- thick but not syrupy. The base maltiness is surprisingly complex, even spicy, which may be due to the hops that so not impart much bitterness. The chocolate flavor is subdued in a good way, providing an extra layer of flavor without bogging down the beer so that it becomes a candy bar. What lingers is an earthy malt flavor imbued with chocolate.

A - Pours a black that exposes some dark brown tints around the corners of the glass. Nice and fluffy khaki three finger head forms, settles into a thin but lasting cap. Great lacing and retention. Super sticky and clinging.

S - The aroma starts off with sweet milk chocolate, burnt coffee, and roasted malts. A huge blast of piney and grapefruit hops then sends you into confusion. 

T - Sweet bakers chocolate, espresso, and char collide with the piney and citric hops. The flavors wash away quickly leaving behind the bitterness typical of an IPA.

M - On the thin to medium side with plenty of carbonation. Works well with the style and flavors and makes for an easy drinking beer. In the span of this review Ive already downed a glass...

Smells of citrus fruits like pineapple and lemon with some pine; as well as roasted coffee and chocolate undertones. Can detect some sweetness from the mexican sugar as well. Smells more like a black ipa than a porter, but Im not surprised because it is floyds. The taste profile is the opposite of the smell. Taste starts with roasted coffee, some milk chocolate, vanilla. Then in the middle you start to get the citrus fruits like lemon and grapefruit. But mostly get pine qualities which make sense since it is a christmas porter. Gets a much smoother and creamier mouthfeel. The roasted coffee and chocolate stay constant throughout. Finishes with a blend of the pine and citrus qualities, as well as the bold, roasted coffee and chocolate notes, maybe some licorice. For a 6% beer, the mouthfeel is not watery in the least bit.

Ive been drinking a lot of porters/stouts lately, and this one wasnt as remarkable as others Ive had lately. Still, not bad though. To quote C. Griswold: Merry Christmas... Merry Christmas...

Hearty full bodied dark malt structure, chocolate, ash, beef broth, with equally dominant hop character that leans more toward coniferous and herbal traits. A different profile than most imperial porters, but in a very good way (why expect otherwise from Three Floyds I guess!). Just awesome.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

1482,"2012-03-01",3.1,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/17/2011.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

Alpha Klaus pours a very dark brown color with a speck of ruby, with a fuller spectrum of cherry red colors in the edges of the glass. A fluffy, creamy beige head forms on the pour and lingers for a while, leaving lacing to cling to the glass.

There is chocolate malt, lots of pine hops and some light earthy and grassy hops in the aroma. 

This is sort of a simple porter. It starts off with some chocolate malt, but the pine hops are the focus. Some earthy and grassy hops are present as well, mimicking the aroma. Lingering hop bitterness. It seems like I do not agree with their recipe, but as usual, the execution was skillful. 

The body is moderately full, with medium creamy carbonation. The hops pull at my taste buds a little bit and leave the tongue dry, with some residue behind my lips. 

Heavily hopping this beer just was not a decision that coalesces with what I am looking for in a Christmas Porter. This is quite possibly the first time I will want a less-hopped beer and most likely the last.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Thinner bodied than expected with some tight carbonation, possibly the beginning sign of oxidization.

The pour is a clear, deep black tea color looking true black in the snifter with a large, coffee head that sticks around nicely with decent webby lace. Nose is a little weird but no off flavors: sort of mustic attic (very strong), wet cedar, old pine cone/woodland potpourri, spicy meat, spicy lemon/lemon tea. But then it quickly devolves to classic black olives and brine that plague heavy stouts/porters. This is thankfully balanced by heavy raisins and Raisinettes. Taste is not too heavy with nice spicy potpourri, cinnamon, leaves, spicy orange peel and dried lemon. Palate feels thinner, light lemon with a slight tang but lots of cocoa butter and thick chocolate in the finish. Strange but not so much a heavy Imperial Porter as much as what it was meant to be, a classic London porter albeit with a little heavier dose of bitter chocolate and spice medley.

The aroma is very very strong. It smells like smoke which is amazing to me, never smelled that in anything other than a rauch. There are also some notes of oak and coffee.

Pours a dark, dark blackish brown with hints of light ruby brown on the edge. The head is decently sized, tan, and recedes with some nice lacing.

First off in the smell it has a nice hop profile with piney, earthy hops. The malts have both chocolate and roasted coffee characters.

The hops arent as evident in the taste but this is a straight up KICK ass porter, it just overtook Black Butte for me. It has light roasty flavors, plenty of sweetness, chocolate, some fruitiness, and a nice large backing of super piney hops. This is a winter beer for all winter beers.

The mouthfeel is near perfect, with decent carbonation but a big, full mouthfeel. Drinkability is excellent.

This is a freakin amazing brew, luckily there is a huge stash at the store near me, I might have to go stock up for the summer.

The head never settles completely, leaving tendrils of light brown on the glass. The taste is a balance of chocolate and hops, just like the aroma suggests. The flavor of sugar follows the body almost immediately, adding to the smoothness of the brews impact on the palate.

There is a slight pungent chocolate taste, not unlike a Caribbean Stout in some respects, but the odd hoppiness twist and tweaks it into its own realm.  Pleasant bitter chocolate tones, never overly thick or sticky.  There is an almost herbal/spicy feel, not unlike Anchor OSA.

Tastes fairly different than most porters I have had, because there is a hop presence, but unlike gonzo porter which I felt was more a dark IPA than a hoppy porter, they intermingle rather well with the chocolate and creamy tastes, neither really overpowering, but working in a balanced fashion.

The aroma is just outstanding; a mix of potent tropical fruit hoppiness (mostly pineapple, with a good dose of ripe grapefruit) and subtle dark chocolate.   If you close your eyes, you might almost think IPA, but the chocolate is also unmistakable.   The flavor also has plenty of tropical fruit and dark chocolate, with a dry, earthy, almost smokey quality as well.   The finish is dry and earthy with a medium bitterness that isnt nearly as intense as the hop aroma and flavor.   Not nearly as thick thick or sweet as I had expected, and I really like that.   This drinks much easier than you might think, in a sharp departure from a certain stout that FFF makes, with a medium body and moderate carbonation.   This was an awesome and pretty unique beer.

Behind the hops theres a nice roast malt note, and a touch of bitter chocolate, smoke, and leather.  Smells amazing.  Medium to thick mouthfeel, leathery.  Nice spiciness aided by the lively carbonation.  Big roast characteristic on the finish giving it a nice bitterness, but a very refined one at that.  Remarkably good, and yet another FFF beer that makes me miss them distributing to NY.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

1482,"2009-05-22",3.7,"Thanks to Bobby91w for sending this one my way. Pours a deep, dark brown - almost black - with a light tan head. Honest to God, the first thing I smell is cola. Afri cola, for those who may remember that one. Some chocolate as well, and a very mild note of roasty coffee. Flavor brings out the coffee a bit more. Certainly malt-forward, and I can actually taste the warm Mexican sugar in there, too. The palate is nice - a crisp carbonation, but it doesnt have that dry finish that I usually look for in darker brews. Nutty sweet, and smooth for sure, but having discovered the bliss that is a good impy stout, porters just arent my style.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

Appearance - This is definitely a porter from the dark side... No light is shining through this one. An easy pours creates a 1 finger creamy tan head. After the head dissipates, the walls of the glass are covered with lace, if you could even call it lace, see as it is as solid as I have ever seen.

Smell - Smells like your average everyday porter. Having a hard time pulling the scents out of this one. All I can pick up is chocolate. Maybe a little bit of spice? After this warmed up a bit, I was starting to get some very floral earthy hop smells. Very unexpected and very welcomed! This one smells great!

Taste - My taste buds are having a hard time as well tonight. I am picking up some spices, like in the smell. A little nutty too. I am starting to pick up some roasted malt and hops! Wow here come the hops! What a surprise, those hops came out of nowhere! I wish I would have tried this fresh, would have been ridiculous...

Mouthfeel - It is a little watery for my tastes, I was hoping for something a little fuller. I have been drinking a lot of motor oil lately though (RISs), so that might be skewing the mouthfeel of this a little. 

Drinkability - Because it is not too thick, it doesnt weigh me down like what I am used to. This makes this VERY drinkable for me. The taste was definitely pleasant as well. When the hops came out, it became phenomenal! I should have tried this one back at Christmas! This should be awesome fresh and should be pretty good with a couple years on it as well. Guess I will just have to wait and see.","Salem, Oregon, USA","josephselander"
1482,"2009-04-28",3.8,"Poured the whole dang bottle into a ridiculously huge tulip glass and looked upon a rather nice ruby tinged brown beer with light tan foam.  The concoction smells rather nice, a combination of American hops, little bit of citrus, maybe some pine, and chocolaty malt sweetness.  The flavor is happily complex, starts with malt sweetness and a twinge of hop bitterness, moves into some chocolate, then some kind of tea like flavor (that was far too present in the bottle of Black Sun I had, but pleasant here), and finishes off with a nice bitter roasted coffee aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is moderate.  Overall, this is a good beer.","Ohio, USA","TearsforBeers"

1482,"2009-02-03",4.6,"22 oz bottle.  Near heavenly aroma on this one, tons of roasted, nutty malts, dark chocolate, coffee beans, and very pronounced hop backing as well of standard yet always interesting 3Fs variety.  Nice pour as well, small-medium creamy beige head, mostly dissipates, with a little lacing, and a color of dark sepia.  The first thing I notice upon sipping this one is the excellent balance for a strong and very hop heavy porter. Less heavy on the body than i remembered but definitely not in bad way, it also very drinkable and can easily be drunk as a session beer.  A good amount of roastiness fills the flavor profile throughout, could also be described as smokey as well.  Semi sweet/ semi rich black/chocolate malt and minor sugar crystals come through, but it is not all that chocolaty nor coffee flavored either as maybe i would expect. Just a very solid combination of darker yet not overly sweet malt.  Hop backing is as evident as any as i can even describe them to be slightly citrus mango and floral in style.

1482,"2009-01-18",3.8,"22oz bottle aged since 2007. Pours a very dark brown, almost black body with a big, creamy and frothy, two-fingerwidth, brown head that dissipates slowly and remains heavily laced. Damn good looking porter. Aroma of chalky milk chocolate, dry coffee, and a good amount of cascade-ish grapefruit hops giving it a slightly earthy quality. Slightly roasty and a touch of vanilla. A lot of nice smells, I just wish it was a little stronger in the nose. Flavor is pretty similar, but the earthy citrus hop is more evident than the standard roasty character in a normal porter. Semi sweet and lightly chocolated in the beginning before drying out in the finish with a distinct grapefruit bitterness and a touch of roast and coffee. Theres a nice soft maltiness throughout that gives off a very lightly burnt taste. Palate is light to medium bodied and slightly higher in carbonation than most porters giving it a tingly feel. Overall, I love FFF for bending the rules when it comes to style and hop additions, but I think when Im looking for a big porter, Im more interested in a creamy, chocolate roast taste rather than this particular one. I think the added hops make this very flavorful, but too quick on the tongue. Definitely a great porter that I would recommend to a lot of people, but I have a hard time puting this at the top of my list of favorites.

I was a little worried that this one sat too long but once I popped the top and the aroma of coffee and chocolate filled the air.  Poured black with a beast of a head that overflowed my Corsendonk snifter.   Aromas are coffee, roasted malts, and an underlying sweetness.  Flavor is bitter chocolate up front highly carbonated on the palate and believe it or not hops are still present.  Finish is all roast and a slight burn from the alcohol but no real alcohol flavor.

The caramel is even more pronounced in the falvour along with the fruity chocolate. Good delicate notes of alcohol and some lovely peaty earth underneath.

Pours a very dark brown, just about black, with a large and luscious light brown head that lasted through two-thirds of the glass and left a curtain of lace with each sip.  Very pleasant aroma of chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and some floral hops.  The flavor is equally nice with chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and a bit of dark fruit.

Smell is mainly burnt coffee and chocolate malts.  There is also a definite sweetness as well with vanilla and maybe some oatmeal in the background.

Taste picks up where the aroma left off with sweet malts up front but with a burnt coffee kick and some oatmeal smoothness.    I also got more chocolate in taste and a hint of hops in the finish with some coffee bitterness as well.

As you get past the initial hops, the more malty aromas appear. Roasted coffee is pretty dominant with toffee and a dry cocoa as its complement. The mouthfeel is strangely very juicy. The flavour is of pine and juicy, sweet apple mixed with some chocolate, molasses, and lightly roasted coffee. The lasting sweetness seems to be a blend of a fruit-like sweetness and molasses. Coffee and cocoa flavours escalate towards the moderately dry and bitter finish. However, the sweet fruitiness continues to be somewhat dominant.

D- This one is a bit heavy for a porter but still highly drinkable. In my opinion three floyds often doesnt live up to the hype but I have to admit this one was excellent.","California, USA","Lothore"

Aroma of light chocolate, toffee, a hint of roast, and citrus hops.  Interesting.  Lightly tart citrus entry mellows out into a smooth, lightly roasted chocolate that ends with a bit of chalky bitterness to compliment the hops.  Nice smooth mouthfeel.

1482,"2008-03-18",4.4,"22 oz. purchased at the brewpub last December. So the two lowest ratings on the current page Im looking at were ratings below 3 points. Interesting. One claims the beer to be too sweet. One too dry. Again, interesting. I dont rate often enough but I felt compelled to do so here. Ive had this a few times, last night being one of them. The Alpha Klaus starts with this big chocolate aroma that is complimented by big piney, floral American hops. Similar to their Black Sun Stout, but not as creamy/rich/heavy in aroma. The layers of complexity on the nose lead to more on the tongue. Roastiness and a bit of milk chocolate to start. Mid palate the bitterness chimes in, pushing those showoff roasted malts to the side. The mouthfeel on this was really amazing: Slick and somewhat thick. It cleans itself up well. A dry, light roast finish with that signature citrus American hop. This really is the ultimate winter warmer to these lips. Incredible beer.","Blowing Rock, North Carolina, USA","BleacherBum"
1482,"2008-03-12",4.2,"Above the black depth an enormous tan foam erupts to produce a fascinating spectacle. A large plateau initially expands upwards, while a ravine sinks at its center  a preamble worth the admission. Dry, roasted; a subtle smoky aspect laces the bitter chocolate and coffee. Delicious tones of bacon and black pepper balance the fragrant act followed by vanilla ice cream, sweet butter and hints of grapefruit. The flavor remains surprisingly in control. I say that after my first experiences of Three Floyds, namely 2004 Dark Lord and Behemoth. The crazy fudge is nowhere to be seen, and instead a sweet smooth consistency provides the perfect vessel for beautifully roasted dark chocolate and coffee. Almost no bitterness is involved and amazingly the hops are relatively subdued. Real vanilla bean is present, while toffee and oozing caramel add a pleasant depth. Alpha Klaus redeems my hope that Three Floyds is capable of a working beer, not just roller coasters. Excellent.

This is one heck of a fantastic porter. Absolutely gorgeous pour, nothing left to desire. Deep black with brown highlights, gorgeous fluffy cocoa-grey head. Ah...

The aroma is richly roasty, coffee entangling with mild smoke, dry chocolate, notes of cherry, gently vinous. Wonderful and alluring. The flavor is not out to kick your teeth in, but rather just to be a delight. This is a drinking beer, not some sipping aperitif. Just the right amount of sweetness, again roast malt, moderate coffee and chocolate components, a nice balanced vinous touch, yeah, balanced is the word here. Its superbly balanced.

Smells very similar to some of the better Imperial Stouts that Ive had.  Dark chocolate and coffee all the way here with a nice piney hop smell lingering in the background.  

If this was thicker in body, I would swear that this is an Imperial.  Extremely tasty porter here.  Lots of porters seem to concentrate solely on being smoky but this one has a nice hop presence as well that I really like.  To this point, this is the best porter that I have ever had.  That being said, I have an Olfabrikken in the fridge that I will be trying in a few days so I should have a reference point there.

Fresh cold press, mint leaves, and warm cinnamon dough in the aroma; pleasantly earthy, damply green and softly spiced.  Bold vegetal coffee notes and cola bitterness in the flavor highlight alot of dry conifer woodsiness.  Holly, spruce, dry hops.  Pure, amiable cinnamon sweetness, very bready and rich with the crunch of mexican sugars, imbued briefly with cranberry tartness and needly bitterness.  Black licorice licks strongly but not astringently in a very sweet middle palate; sugars are well bridled, hops carefully managed.  Medium to full bodied, smooth and fairly sticky in the mouth.  Very earthy before smacking with root beer candies and dark toffee in a long finish.  Well made, and achieving with ease the delicate balance between its dark sweetness and Christmas hop-spice interplay.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Nice roasty character.  balanced mild sweetness and slightly drying and bittering hops.  The hops are just bordering on too much for a porter, but never really get there.

The aroma is fairly simple but quite nice: bittersweet chocolate malt and solid, dark, roasted malt with just a hint of hops poking out in the background. Medium-bodied and silky-slick with a nice lightly bitter finish. The flavor is a tasty blend of roasted chocolate malt and bright, piny hops. In print, that combination sounds odd, but in reality it works quite well.

1482,"2007-11-11",4.1,"2006 vintage aged nearly one year.  Pours a very dark mahogany body with a virtually black center.  A large, foamy, khaki colored head shows good retention, settling very slowly to a thin layer.  Sticky patches of lacing coat the glass.  The aroma is based on a masterful blend of sweet and bitter chocolates.  Accompanying the chocolaty goodness is caramel, vanilla, and a heaping amount of resinous pine hops.  I even picked up a faint hint of mint on the nose.  The flavor is comprised of mostly the same components, though dried dark fruits emerge and the resinous hops really show through strong.  Rich and complex.  Medium-full bodied and silky smooth.  Finishes with an awesome chocolaty, piney flurry.  Awesome beer!  If I had to give an overall analogy, Id say this beer feels the way a snow covered evergreen forest looks.  Perfect for a Christmas seasonal.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1482,"2007-11-10",4.6,"1000!  This is it!  Generously donated to the cause by Dan!  Thanks again and again.  2006 22oz bomber tasted 10NOV2007.  Nice lively hiss as the cap is popped.  Pours like oil unleashing a finger width of thick tan head.  Nice viscotiy.  Heady aromas of berry fruit and bready toffee.  Warming, not burning the nostrils.  Full bodied with a huge malt character followed up by an equally impressive hop bitterness.  Chocolate malt notes.  Short lived sweet candy malt flavor.  This lingers for a bit, then its replced by a big bitter dark coffee acidity and citrus resinous hops.  Lovely stratography of the clinging head.  Wonderful melding and joining of such extreme flavors.  Blitzkreigs over the palate and smacks around my taste buds.  I eagerly submit.  Cocoa maltiness.  Acidic grapefruit hops.  Sticky bitter tingling finish.  Thick and delicious.  The second pour is less gracefull and produces a three finger potential overflow of tight head.  The head is very slowly dissipating, and it only adds a creamy smoothness to the already phenomenal malt character.  As it warms, the subtle fruit notes surface.  Red and black berries.  Raisins and dried fruits.  Dark chocolate sweetness with an almost lingering fudgy note.  And while the malts still dance and linger in the mouth, the dry almost tart hop finishkinda brings you back.  Ebbs and flows.  Strikes and gutters! Third and final glass once again produces more head than nectar.  Good looking tight clinging layered head.  If its possible, there seems to be more cocoa and choclate in the nose.  The only other not forementioned immediate addition is a citrus zest.  Maybe from the yeast, but most probally from the hop profile.  Yeah, the hops.  Sugary and candy.  Citrus notes.  Nice fruit hop mix between orange, lemon and grapefruit.  But still such a blissfull cocoa malt flavor.  I always lovingly use ""toasty roasty""  as a quality for a fine porter.  And while this has set a new zenith, it still has that simple nuance. More fruit at the finish of the glass.  The head has lingered through the finale.  And contributed an overall rounding to the bitter and piney middle and finish.  This has truly been an experience!

Medium-to-full mouthfeel: carbonation is mild without being soft; plenty of cocoa and floral and vegetal notes at the core; creamy without being sticky, with a nice spice presence and sticky piney hops (even after about a year in the bottle); quite vegetal and green, but integrated nicely into a chocolatey / cocoa core; very drinkable, and different from any other porter Ive ever had, certainly; the piney / resiny hop character puts this in its own class.

In long: Dryness reaches your nose before your lips can touch the beer.  This is indeed a very roasted stout/porter bordering ashes.

The reward is worth it, a big roasty nose and a delightfully creamy brew.

Alpha Klaus poured deep dark brown into my pint glass. When I hold it closer to the light for inspection I see mahogany highlights throughout. Formed a creamy 1 finger head upon the pour that faded to a super creamy half-finger head that lasted. Leaves faint drink history lacing with each sip. Very nice looking. 

The smell of this beer is so unique and wonderful it fully deserves a 5. The first whiff I take reminds me of caramel corn. Strange but nice. I then take a deeper whiff, the caramel corn leads things off again but transfers flawlessly into herbal and mildly piney hops in the middle. This is again transformed seamlessly into a bittersweet chocolate bar with mild coffee. I dont know how the hops pair so perfectly with the other aromas but they do. This stuff smells amazing.

I wasnt sure what to expect. Ive never really had a darker beer like this with the obvious amount of hops that this has. I couldnt have wished for more than I got. This beer is packed full of big chocolate and coffee notes. Big roastiness and somehow the hops pair perfectly. With an herbal bite that lightens up all the dark flavors. Finishes with slight coffee ground bitterness and instantly after that a mild pine hop bite. Such a unique beer.

The mouthfeel is close to perfect. Its medium bodied yet creamy. Mild carbonation lets things work through on their own. It just slides through my mouth so easily. Theres also a nice mild lingering bitterness that is a very nice touch.

Drinkability is outstanding. This one goes down so easy. Its so creamy and flavorful you have to work to not gulp it down.

Alpha Klaus is another incredible beer from Three Floyds. It amazes me how perfectly all the big flavors go together. I have never had such a unique and fun drinking porter. Definately worth seeking out.

1482,"2007-04-28",4.2,"This beer wad served in a Delirium Tremens tulip glass.  An aggressive pour produced a one finger brown head that quickly is reduced to a thin, self-replenishing film.  The beer is a nearly opaque dark brown.  The aroma is powerful and complex, beautifully balancing crisp chocolate malt, aromatic hops and a crisp fruity edge.  I am enjoying the aroma so much I am reluctant to drink.  The mouth-feel is medium-bodied, a bit lighter than expected, and somewhat creamy with carbonation.  The flavor is bold and complex, leading and finishing with a sharp roasted malt bitterness, yet with the Alpha hop character constantly lurking in the shadows of my palate.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Sombeast"
1482,"2007-04-25",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2007 Despite the symbolism of silent nights and spiritual reverence, the modern Christmas holiday is absolutely a season of excess.  Left-leaning celebrators have long opined on the holidays sell out to ravenous capitalism, but the problem of excess extends beyond that.  The culture of Christmas has gone beyond the pale of Germanic tradition into something characterized by bright colored lights, mythical creatures and a litany of songs.  Awesome.  But the greatest excess, the grandest excess, and the unhealthiest excess is the culinary Christmas.  Throwing away diets at the behest of a holiday, we justify a month long gorging with a living-life-to-its-fullest mentality, for fear that if we dont indulge in one more glass of egg-nog or one more square of fudge than that years Christmas celebration will be tainted and irreversibly marked as the worst Christmas ever.  Im all for the feast, even if my body isnt, but I never expected to see this unchecked Yuletide hunger extend to from food to beer.  I mean, Dr. Seuss found curious dopplegangers for the roast beef (roast beast) and the years hot new toy (the Ting-tingler, duh) but there was never a beer in the table for the Whos of Whoville.  We may blame this on the books target audience of whom beer was still an inaccessible drink, but I believe it is because there is no equivalent culture of excess for Christmas seasonal beers.  The brews that do line up on the seasonal shelf are probably had sparingly, compared to the Christmas roast-ham, all five pounds weighing each sleepy eater all the way to bed at every supper.  Mind you, Christmas is a holiday where consumption may be uncontrollable, but quality is neither sacrificed nor suppressed.  Thats why the Alpha Klaus is a prime candidate to plant the seed for a new Christmas tradition.  Ill admit I dont know whether the Alpha Klaus is actually released near Christmas or not, but Ill defend its place as a Christmas beer here, in the hopes that Americans may find a way to glut themselves on a seasonal brew alongside their fruit logs and gift certificates from Sharper Image.  The Alpha Klaus is a nice, warm brown, the color of oxidized apple flesh, with head piled to the brim with tiny, shiny bubbles that mimic brown pearls.  A few minutes after my pour the mushrooming head settled down and began to quake, eventually flopping over into a plateau shape.  I never knew a beer could be so animated.  However, the Alpha Klaus doesnt touch on its rich, tappable decadence until the aroma has a chance to punch through the bubbly bulwark, immediately mesmerizing the nose with the aroma of apples and hickory smoke.  I begin to feel like Im at a cider house, when some equally cold-repellant aromas drift into my nostrils: barbeque, raisin, sparkling cider, hearty glazed carrots and katsudon sauce.  All are perfectly blended to create a warm, low, slow, sweet amalgam with the sophistry of European cuisine and enough sugary charm to placate a child.  The taste inherits the finer points of the aroma.  A simple sip opens with an escalating sweetness, beginning with a natural apple flavor and dark chocolate, with the competing tangy bitterness and cocoa bitterness playing a beautiful duet on the tongue.  Whipped cream follows quickly, settling the heated competition, and then sassafras enters the fray to offer a second round of root beer oriented sweetness.  After this first wave of flavors settles down into a quieter self-discussion on the palate, a quenching, slightly sweet slightly bitter iced tea flavor makes a small appearance, followed by marshmallow.  For a winter-time beer its not heavy, or cumbersome.  The mouth feel is clear and lucid, easy to manipulate in the mouth and easier to swallow  almost fluffy.  Three Floyds Alpha Klaus is a beer that begs to be had when the drinker is already comfortable, far from the elements and securely blanketed in at least three layers of soft cloth and placed within a two meter radius of a roaring fireplace.  The dynamics of the taste are somewhat uninteresting, but the flavors that are there are immeasurable delicious and harmonious.  If there is a beer to spearhead the campaign for a beer to go with that pile of sweets, then this is a prime candidate.  Even if it doesnt succeed, I know that this will be a bottle that I myself will pursue with the same feral persistence that many shoppers walk into stores with come that time of year, when joy, jubilation and the fiercest of rivalries flare up across the country.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

More hops than I expected, but it balanced well with the bittersweet cocoa taste, coffee, and roasted malt.  A more distinctive taste for a porter than those of late.

Well, I wasnt disappointed...first I was welcomed by a large dose of pine and grapefruit.  Fortunately, that wasnt all, as chocolate and coffee tones came through afterward and dominated after opening.  This Bad Santa poured dark black with huge billowing tan head.  A beautiful sight for sure.  The taste was slightly less than I was hoping for...the tastes of the roasted malts were a little subdued, though certainly there.  The finish was a nice combination of bitter hops and coffee.  Ill have to go back to PA near Christmas to score another bottle of this.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"

1482,"2007-04-01",4.4,"poured from 22 oz. bomber, the only way this beer is available as I understand it, into a rugged pint beer glass, on a windy April Fools Day (my 25th wedding anniversary), while wearing my black Guinness 1759 logo hat, slow smoking a slab of pork shoulder on the grill, and looking at Alpha Klaus menacing visage on the label wantonly dumping hops into his strange brew like they grew on trees or something.  I got the last two bombers left on the shelf, or so the nice, helpful young lady at Keg Liquors in Clarksville, IN told me.  No more til next yule.  First impressions: Wow! What a dark brew.  As an experiment, I held the glass up to a glowing light bulb, and you cant see light through this stuff!  The guys at Three Floyds did an excellent job on this recipe, delicious in every way, and Ive rarely seen its like for head retention.  The head rises in a column like soft serve ice cream and has a color like that taken on by the dollop of whipped cream on top of an espresso drink after its been floating on the coffee for a while.  It leaves little gradations on the glass, marking each place where you took another quaff.  It strikes me that I picked the wrong time of year to sample this beer.  I wish I had had it two months ago, while sitting next to a roaring fire, wearing my thick baja hoodie and listening to Woodys Roadhouse on WFPL FM Louisville on Saturday night, while everyone else in the house dozed dreamily in their beds.  Whereas I have downed a pint of Alpha Klaus already (the 7 or so ounces left in the glass is still holding tenaciously onto the remaining trace of head, and I have consumed it pretty slowly), and the 7.5 % ABV has worked its magic on me, and as I am somewhat of a neophyte at this beer rating stuff, Ill leave it to the other beer loving wordsmiths on this site to fine in the details for you.  All I can say is Wow. Wow. WOW!  This beer deserves whatever mystique has attached itself to it due to its seasonal nature and limited availability.  Its good, nay excellent, beer if you can get it.  The very buzzable and fearsome Alpha Klaus will see you again, with his Santa Claus hat terminating in a hop flower where the puff of cotton is supposed to be, when frost is in the air late 2007!

This is a beer to be split and shared with friends when the weather is bad, the snow is coming down, and you have nothing to do but drink beer. If you have this in the summer time, its worse than ordering a gin and tonic in february. Save it for December. Big boozy aroma is really not what the beer tastes like.

1482,"2007-03-18",4.4,"Im very impressed with this beer.  It is slightly hoppy and extremely roast-y without a tremendous amount of chocolate or coffee.  It reminds me a great deal of Founders Black Rye, which I tremendously enjoy.

Color is a dark black, but is not the inky-black of imperial porters.  As the beer went from bottle to glass, it appeared more of a light brown.  Aroma is lightly of centennial hops, superceded by pleasing chocolate malt roastiness.  Flavor is very dry and roasty, but not too cholate-y or coffee-ish.  The dryness is great, and reminsicent of Founders Black Rye to me.  Mouthfeel is almost ""chalky,"" perhaps due to the dry character of this beer, but somehow matches the flavors Im detecting.

I can also smell chocolate and a little smoke. Decent initial head that fades away quickly. Color is dark rich porter. First sip is of oily hops with a chocolate background.  This is as oily as some of the larger barelywines Ive had. Thats a real feat for a 7.5% porter!  Even though theres a shitload of hops here- they are not out of place. NOt overly astringent, just a flavourable balance with the sweetness of the malt.  The malt is very rich and reminds me somewhat of a impy stout moreso than a traditional porter. no matter- it is delicious.

Good porter carbonation, maybe even a little high for a porter and a crisp, slick, velvety smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.

Tastes of burnt coffee and grain, bittersweet baking chocolate, molasses, piney and grapefruity hops, high bitterness for a porter, but actually balanced in relationship to the malts, the alcohol is well masked, but warming in the palate, and a dryish grapefruity, roasted malty finish.

Its extremely inviting.  Having to wait to taste as each pour contributes a massive head, which slowly disappates.  As it warms, I just cant wait to start sipping this.

Tastes; mix a perfect IPA with a perfect porter and somehow have them both retain their perfect complexity and not bash into each other and this what you get. The stages are so distinct its like youre taking a sip of one beer and then a sip of another. Big bread, yeast, and grapefruit hops in stage one, hitting you all in a rush.

1482,"2006-04-26",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2006 Pours blacker than most any porter Ive seen.  The loose to average density tan head head is completely explosive!  Pour slowly, or wait a few for it to settle down.  the nose is all apiaceous carrotty sort of smells, with roast, sweet malt, fruity, floral hops, and of course, holiday spices, though much more nondescript than most holiday ales (which is a plus here!).  The texture  is about as creamy as a porter can be, though still slightly watery, reminding me this is a porter, not a stout.    A little chewy/sticky/slippery.  The flavors are robust as can be.  Sweet mollassey roast malt, bitter floral hops, some bittersweet chocolate, subtle cinnamon and alcohol accented hops.  The finish is really dry given how sweet this beer is upfront, reminding me of a strong dry stout.  Before the after taste goes completely to charcoal, it passes through some chocolatey moments.  The alcohol level is quite complimentary to the flavor in this brew.  A point or two was knocked off for the price on this brew, but overall, certainly worthy.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

1482,"2006-04-14",3.4,"04-05 bomber shared by SuIIy on 4/9/06Deep cocoa brown colored body, is mostly clear upon settling, with very deep magenta highlights on the edges.  Head is light tan colored, fairly rapidly fading to ring and partial cover, with minimal lacing.The nose throws plenty of burnt, ashen malt notes, a smooth, medium-dry vanilla note in the background and plenty of orange-chocolate that seems rather burly and actually envelopes the roasted notes.  Some pine resin notes emerge, mostly dry, bitter, not overly aromatic, while hints of black coffee continue to persist on end.  Hops are muted at this point, but still provide large amounts of bitterness, while the chocolate is dry, chalk-like and rather dulling to the nose.The flavor is at first filled with crunchy, dry, old coffee, quickly adding mildly sweet milk chocolate notes.  However, the sweetness does not seem to last long as it begins to get lost in an astringent roastiness that carries with it a mix of dry orange and heavily dry hop-leafiness.  A very dry, ashy-chalky note hangs on the palate.  Hard bite on the end of dry malts that have no where to go (too filtered, leading to not a comforting or supportive enough texture).  That said, the flavor is still very true to an American porter, with plenty of American bittering hops.  Overall, however, I just find it too dry, hard and dull.  The carbonation is low, however, and the body lightly chewy, though watery on the end upon warming.  Alcohol is well-concealed throughout the flavor and aroma.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1482,"2006-03-19",3.8,"(22 oz bottle) Deep black with very little dark tan head. Aroma of roast malt and some hops. Flavor is roast malt, coffee, with a lot of hops for a porter. another good beer from 3 Floyds.","Manchester, Missouri, USA","kwoeltje"
1482,"2006-03-07",4.2,"06-Mar-06 (22 oz bottle: Obtained 17-Sep-04 in trade with CaptainCougar, thanks Tom!) This is a well-aged bottle, at least 18 months old, and it has been refrigerated the entire time its been in my possession.  Just last week, I had a sizeable sample from a recent bottle (courtesy of SDbruboy), so that memory is still fresh in my mind.  Whereas bright hops were at the forefront of the fresh bottle, here, the hops are expectedly subdued so what Im sampling this evening is an earthy, roasty, chocolaty, and moderately sweet, yet still wonderfully delicious porter.  Moderate-to-strong roasty bitterness stays on the palate the entire session, regardless of how much time elapses between sips.  A bit of toasty malt emerges on the palate long after Ive swallowed, somewhere around 15 to 20 seconds later.  And as the beer warms up, the chocolate becomes more pronounced, pulling even with the roast, eventually surpassing it, and a fair amount of smoke has its moments too.  Obviously, lots of transitions with this beer and I find the aftertaste to be very pleasant and exceptionally long-lasting, but Im most enamoured that every sip seems to offer something different.  Earthy, roasty aromas abound, but unfortunately the nose just cant quite match up with the excellence of the flavor.  Medium-full bodied, substantial for sure, but not heavy or sticky, but again, as the beers temperature increases, so too does the body.  Carbonation is light to medium, so coupled with the smooth, rich and creamy mouthfeel, this beer drapes every corner of the mouth in luxury.  Deep brown in color, not black, but still dark enough that its opaque in my tulip glass.  The tulip helps build the head to nearly an inch in height on the pour, and having a tall, light tan head contrasting so vividly with the dark body is very attractive.  The head gradually settles to a patchy film surrounded by a wide ring, and lacing is also fairly patchy.  If the hops is what makes this porter so special for you, then drink it fresh.  But if earthy, roasty, chocolaty, less-hoppy porters is more your speed, this is an exceptional candidate for longer-term aging.  I fall into the second group, and have found this aged bottle to be significantly better.  Just a wonderfully complex porter, one that filled with transitions, one that seems to continually presents new and exquisite flavors.  Possibly the best American porter Ive ever tasted.26-Feb-06 (22 oz bottle: Shared by SDbruboy, thanks Cliff!) Quite an unusual porter, but not so surprising for a Three Floyds beer.  This is a porter where the hops really works from a position of strength.  Plenty of moderately sweet chocolate complemented by the herbal hops, but surprisingly, the bitterness is relatively mild.  And its not especially roasty either.  The nose is grassy, lightly roasty, yeasty and mildly sweet, but theres a bit of earthiness that doesnt really show up in the flavor.  Medium-full bodied.  Very dark brown in color, but ruddy at the edges.  Light tan head shows nice retention.  I have a bottle at home of this and I look forward to seeing how this compares.

Initial flavor of dark roasted coffee beans and bitter chocolate, and not much residual sweetness. Mouthfeel was too fizzy on the tongue.  I did not dig the finish on this one, as it was too bitter and has too much burnt flavor for a porter. Dont get me wrong, I am a hophead. This is not what I personally enjoy from a porter.

Wow. This beer is just packed with huge hop aromas, big chocolate flavors, and mouth puckering bitterness. FFF fans will love this over the top version of Christmas Porter, and Alpha Klaus is a must have Christmas beer, for any beer geek. Retailing for $8-$9 a 22 oz bomber bottle, this beer is well worth the price for those interested in a Christmas porter that breaks all the rules. Normal beer drinkers need not apply for this one. The label on this one is the Alpha King wearing a Santa Claus hat, and Alpha Klaus is most generous with the hops. This beer is high on the IBU scale, Im guessing close to 100 IBUs, and ""its not normal"" for a porter, to be such a hop blast of a beer.

Great looking beer with a head that looked great and laced nicely.  After it settled the head became more creamy and consistant.

This is the first pint that I enjoyed at the Three Floyds brewpub.  It was presented in an English pint glass.  Dark brown with a huge dense rocky head that didnt want to go away.  The nose was all hops.  Amarillos if I had to guess.  Some chocolate and roast flavor.  A touch sweet, but the hops were the feature act here too.  A bit on the thinner side.  Overall, Alpha Klause did not live up to expectations.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
1482,"2005-12-24",4.3,"Completely amazing Christmas mix.  It does not taste anything like a porter; at least, I was expecting more of a porter taste than what I experienced.  It pours dark chocolately brown with a thin lacing.  Smells of chocolate and berries.  The taste contains a complex mixture of chocolate, smoke and berries that lingers in the mouth for a short while.  I cant wait to have this next Christmas when I find it again.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

It pours jet black with a brown head.  I noticed flavors of chocolate covered espresso beans.  It also had tinges of smoke and briquettes.  You can also taste the hops in the aftertaste as well.  This portes is also mellow and soft with real fine carbonation.  Another Christmas pleasure to drink.  Thanks Indians_Red.","Boise, Idaho, USA","pinkzambia"

1482,"2005-12-20",3.9,"A Floyds approach to porter.  Tastes strongly of chocolate malt, but with the usual Floyds signature hops.  I would have preferred more of a lasting head.  The coloring is true to syle, the taste maybe not quite traditional,  but delicious nevertheless.  The alcohol is not at all apparent, and I applaud the use of Mexican sugar (I love it in Coke from south of the border).

Pours syrupy black with virtually zero head retention.

Nose is super pine cone hops overpowering virtually all other aromas.  Really, this one smells like nothing less than a freshly squeezed Xmas tree.  And to my senses thats a good thing.

The body has a nice heavy gravity to it, sliding down the throat langorously like carbonated molasses... only a slight exagerration, but the enthusiasm brought about by this beer encouraging a bit of truth stretching.

The hops arent nearly as dominant on the tongue as the aroma, but still marginalize the other tastes.  The actual taste of the hops used is quite excellent, however.  A fine, if nearly exquisite, example of what I look for in a Christmas ale.  High marks all around","Austin, Texas, USA","julrey"

This had been aged a few years so the hop element was toned down, but still much more lively than an average porter. Piney hop notes with chocolate cake and coffee in the aroma.

Shockingly, this is very well-balanced taste-wise.  Based on the aroma, I expected it to be biased towards the hops, but there are plenty of malts packed into this too.  Medium-bodied and silky smooth.  Lots of rich chocolate and cocoa present throughout.  Lots of hops too.  Roasty and earthy but absolutely no trace of burnt tastes.  VERY drinkable.

1482,"2005-11-21",4.1,"My first review! Ive been drinking good beers for years but never really though I had the palate to give others a good description of what a beer has to offer, but I think Ive finally nailed it down. Back to the Alpha Klaus. Ive had the 2004 batch and also the 2005 batch that I drank last night. Ill give my review based on the impressions I had last night. Pouring the beer into my Tulip glass I could see that this beer was a very beautiful chocolate color typical of Porters. Also typical, although not to the style guidelines, was the blast of hoppy smell that one would expect from a 3 Floyds brew. However, the aroma did not seem as balanced as I had remembered. It almost smelled piney, and chocolaty. The head was a very nice dark tan with great lacing. As I took a sip I was greeted with a very roasty, chocolaty flavor, followed by pungent American hops. The beer is medium bodied and very drinkable. I did notice a small hint of alcohol, which was unexpected given its ABV. It may be too young still. This 2005 batch did not seem as balanced as the 2004, but was still VERY nice.","Doylestown, Ohio, USA","black95tt"

The nose on this is rich of chocolate, roasty coffee, and nuttiness. Then theres the defined, bright, piny hops. Its something in a porter or stout that took me a while to get used to, but I really enjoy it now. The flavor is really great even just judging the malty character.

On the palate this is divine.  Carbonated to keep it lighter than a stout but creamy as any porter Ive ever had.  This is a daring brew and I love that.

Good balance in the flavor, with black coffee and dark chocolate, ending on a spicy, bitter note. Full bodied and rich, with an oiliness in the mouth. I put some extra points on for all the confusion... then took them back off to make it even more confusing. Ha!

Chocolate aroma, some coffee notes and an interesting earthy, almost grassy hop smell.  Slightly sweet nose, quickly overrun by a cocoa, roasty malt flavor.  Hop presence then begins to assert itself, nicely balanced between bitter and spicy, with a floral pantina that covers the back end of the taste profile.  Finish is very smooth with roastiness melding nicely with an increasingly dominating hop flavor.  Mouthfeel is full and smooth, very lusterous.","San Diego, California, USA","FoolishMortal"

This is nothing like any Porter Ive ever had, but should I expect same ole from Three Floyds??!!
Combine a good Porter with a Dreadnaught hop schedule and pull it off with nary a fault and youd have this beautiful brew!
It only can be described as a Porter the way Three Floyds would do it. Excellent hop presence with a nicely rounded chocolatety smooth Porter.

The initial hoppiness is surprising but after that if only shows up on the last of the finish and some on the aftertaste which is really interpreted as a dry roastiness.  The citrus and chocolate combo works for me because it tastes like dark unsweetend chocolate.  Great example of this style and very enjoyable although overpriced.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","entertheiceman"
1482,"2005-04-04",5.0,"Really damn well done, what else can I say.  I daresay the finest Porter Ive ever had, easily.  Part of my definitiion of a great work of art is: harmonious integration of its elements.  And this ones got it.  Where its complex and variable, it meshes with the rest.  Smokiness, roastiness, chocolate, coffee (on the aroma coinciding just right with the flavor), all coming together in a swirling tongue-caressing elixir that matches precisely and lovingly with the creamy head.  And speaking of that head foam, its of the perfect consistency with respect to both density and thickness.  This is a work of beauty.  Nah, itd be nitpicky to put this at my original score of 4.7.  It doesnt really fall short at all.  Most unforunate indeed that I cant procure a lot more of this fine beverage.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

1482,"2005-02-10",4.4,"Mild chocolate and roasted sweet malt mix with a nice and clean floralesk piney hop start the nose off with a decorous medley. Other mentionables beyond the milk chocolate make for some charred brown sugar and a lovely bourbon laced molasses under current. Impressionable and close to cloning an Imperial stout-like nose. Sometimes wiffs were lighter then others; seemingly changing and without much stability but well worth it when the strength assumes control.

Deep and very dark brown, nearly black with slivers of glowing amber at the bottom. Finger high foam of light tan sits atop for a good stay. Lacing coats in a thin sheeting eventually breaking into webbings all around the glass top.

Great flavors here, super fine balance between a sweet and soft chocolate cake backing that continues to lift itself through the softer yeilding piney hops that perk with a incredibly nice and easy bitterness. Very nice to behold. The chocolate borders a coffee roastyness while maintaining its full-on chocolate cake-like fluffyness and richness. The subtle but eager piney edged hops blend across and within the chocolate without much effort and fit together with a swimmingful smoothness. Great finisher too. Bits of anise and licorice spice pop to the surface blending with leftover roasted barley and oatmeal along with mirco bursts of heavy roasted coffee. Wow and yum! Perfect blend of flavors that I could really get used to.

Strikingly fine and smooth body, lightly creamy, lightly bittered with swell chocolate tones and piney hops; just past a medium fullness thats very well rounded and clean. Nothing harsh or out of place here. Finish is strikingly subtle, yet complexing with a delicate drying character and all that wonderful leftover stuff.

An excellent porter! A big chocolatey balancing act with hops and bittering bite that holds true, bold,smooth, and rich the hold ride through. This is a top notcher in my book! Goes down quickly without much labor.  Kudos 3F! Yummalishious!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Has a grassy, hoppy edge to it, with a little pine and some smoky-woody notes. Sour bitterness in the finish. Overall, rather hoppy, but not as much as I expected.

Appearance is spectacular, deep brown with creamy tan head that holds for the entire glass.  Flavor is solid, again the hops dont really make it through, and the chocolate is present in perfect amounts.  The only complaint I have is that it was a little thin on body, it didnt have that ""liquid food"" consistency.

It is a good beer, but not a great one.  I think my main problem was the gritty feeling I got in my mouth while drinking it.  It almost seemed like there was something that hadnt quite dissolved all the way.  By the end of the glass it was better.   Other than the gritty mouthfeel, this beer smelled and looked fantastic, and it had a really good flavor - one that wasnt nearly as sweet as I was expecting.

Aftertaste shows the bitter hop flavour with no usual roasty malt tastes. Overall, great to try (ive been saving this bottle for some time), especially at two years, but not really a porter to me.

In the bottle the pine hops and chocolate are a disgusting mix, ending up in a bottle I could not drink.
On tap, this beer has mellowed to where the roasted malts and hops blend well, making a tasty porter.

Lions and Tigers and Hops - oh my!  This smells just like Alpha King (imagine that)!  The freshness of this bottle is evident from beginning to end.  The flavor goes from the high-alpha hops to the mild chocolate malt, but doesnt come back for any lingering bitterness.  This makes this exceptionally drinkable.   Some may consider this a little thin and not roasty enough - not me!  So maybe it isnt a classic porter - but it is a good one.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"
1482,"2004-12-06",4.6,"MMMmmm, smell the hops as the bottle opens.  Poured it into the glass half expecting it to be a nice light IPA, but no.  Nice and dark like a porter should be.  This is fairly fresh, so the hops have yet to subside.  
Nice brown color, medium head with a vigorous pour.  The hop aromas are lifting off wisps of chocolate malt, lingering around my nose.  Almost like a sweet & sour sauce, they are opposites that together combine magnificently.  
The taste Is exceptional, nothing like I expected when I opened the bottle.  Probably a bit hoppier than most porter fans would like, but for me it was sublime.  
Like coffee, chocolate, and hop oil put in a crock pot for days, the tastes just meld together in your mouth.
A perfect compliment of tastes, I will age a few bottles of this for comparison after the hops subside.

Some have been good and some have been bad, but none have been great. When I took my first sip of Alpha Klaus I knew it was the greatest porter Ive had.  It poured a dark and rich brown that was close to black. It had a small biege head. A big roasted coffee and cocoa aroma. Full and thick mouthfeel. Not creamy, slick, and rich like a stout, though.

 Ohhh Mama! I can tell by just the fat rocky caramel colored head and the large aromatics radiating from the glass, that this beer is going to be delicious! 
 Ohhhh, Orgas-Mo aromas of BIG America hops mixed with robust highly kilned chocolate malts slap my nostrils first! The flavor brings the most perfect blending of dark malts, coffee, chocolates, toffee,  molasses, sugar rolled raisons, dates, these notes are everywhere! But the hops the hops the hops bring me too ovation! There is such a marvelous blending of citrus, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, and even a light note of pineapple slide right across my palate.. but not too quickly! The citrus just hangs for decades in the back of my mouth Im gong to have to have it arrested for loitering, but I wont press charges! There is also an amazingly spicy note of pine sap that gives this porter such a traffic holiday elegance! The palate is soooooooo full, robust, velvety, and bold Ill be dreaming about this beer tonight! 
Well, FFF does it again! Ill take a case of Alpha Klaus over a case of Dark Lord any damn day of the Week, Month, Year, Decade, Century.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
1482,"2004-11-30",3.7,"Pours with a thick creamy light brown head that sits atop a deep, almost black colored beer.  The aroma has notes of chocolate, espresso, and an astringent roast grain husk character.  These notes are joined by a strong American hop presence that is redolent of tangerine, orange, and grapefruit.  The taste is definitely rich and roasty, with solid notes of coffee, and chocolate.  The hops are also here, but not as prevalent as they were in the nose.  Nevertheless the hops are here from beginning to end.  I get notes grapefruit, tangerines and other citrus fruits.  There is a sweetness to this beer that accentuates the fruity hop notes, in fact I really like how the chocolate porter notes pair with the citrus notes of the hops, it is like a good orange flavored milk chocolate nougat.

While this is definitely quite tasty, it could certainly use a bit more thick, rich, malt notes.  Thicker malt notes would make it just that little bit more festive.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The taste however, seems almost opposite. The hops are contained and simply add more background flavor than being dominant. Roasted malt, coffee and bittersweet chocolate round this out. Body is full and rich while being slightly oily. Finishes with a larger hop taste, more roasted malt, and coffee. Maybe a hint of licorice as well.

1482,"2004-04-18",4.0,"Courtesy of Raindog, thanks sir  Body is dark brown and initially wears a tan head that fast becomes one of the quickest dissipating festival of bubbles I've ever seen. Aroma is very intense with more hops than I can shake a stick at. This is woody, herbal, chocolatey, grapefruity with notes of marijuana and smoke. Quite the melting pot you'd like to cook your dinner with. Very direct and dry yet eminently appealing. On the tongue, it's very grassy, reminding me of the Saison from a few hours ago, sweeter than expected with lots of brown sugar, maple and chocolate. Still, after a few sips, the feeling you have is to be drinking hop juice.. but good hop juice! Well-made and to my liking where a fine medium body with appropriate carbonation sure helps. So, when is next christmas?","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1482,"2004-02-28",3.4,"Pours with a medium-bubbled tan head.    When poured aggressively will pile up to form a rocky mass.  Aroma is chocolate, citrusy hops and some silage (chopped up corn stored in a silo.  Sours a bit over time).  The chocolate aroma is quite subdued, it mostly provides a baseline sweetness.  Otherwise hops and mustiness dominate the aroma.  The flavor starts with fuzzy chocolate malt and finishes with strong bitter and aromatic (citrus again) hops.  Quite a bit of carbonation which I think is distracting.  Otherwise the mouthfeel is lightly creamy.  For whatever reason, I dislike the combination of chocolate and citrusy hops.  I like caramel sweetness with hops (think DFH 90) but apparently not chocolate sweetness with hops.  Seems like some homebrew concoction.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"

Some late fruity and vanilla flavors that again are intriguing, but seem somewhat out of place. Late finish is pure caramel malt goodness. I like it but too many things seem out of place.

February 2004  @ Frielocks place in Buffalo.  Bottle. If you close your eyes your mouth will think your nose is a horrible liar.

There is still a fairly strong and crisp bitterness though, its just not overpowering; most distinguishable was a grapefruit and citrus hop flavor.

1482,"2004-01-08",2.6,"UPDATED: OCT 22, 2006 Bottle.  I think you should include chocolate and pine as a flavor combination that does not work as I found this absolutely disgusting in every respect.  The pine dominates the aroma and taste and in itself this is not bad, but since pine is such overwhelming force if it is overused it quickly becomes tiring.  The pine hops do not enhance, emphasize, or work with the chocolate at all.  In fact these 2 ingredients work opposite of one another and in my mouth it felt like doing a cement mixer.  I have had beers that were bad from poor quality and poor ingredients but this was the worst tasting beer I have tried yet.  This did not work for me at all.

1482,"2004-01-06",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2004 1/6/04.  Poured out of 22 oz. bottle, obtained in a trade with bigbadbear63 from RateBeer 12/4/03.  Pours extremely dark, opaque brown, possibly the darkest, thickest-looking porter I've seen.  Slight reddish-brown edges, but otherwise utterly opaque.  Dark tan head doesn't stay around much but the lacing is quite nice.  Aroma is majorly hopped.  Slight edge of dark malt, and fresh barley but mostly the deliciously floral, sweet grapefruit of those Three Floyds hops-- smells a lot like the Dreadnaught.  Darkness of malt and even a little chocolate comes out a bit as I smell it more.  Initial taste is sour, citrusy and stinging with bitter hops, the malts kind of pushed in the background and around the edges.  Strange mix, I must say.  Finish turns deeply dark and astringent.  Medium-full body, very creamy texture and with a very long, straightforwardly roasty, dark chocolate malt finish.  A little like a smoked porter.  Very little sweetness on the end.  Pretty potent stuff, feeling even more powerful than the 7.5% alcohol indicates, but I'd like it to mellow out a bit.  Still pretty damn good.  Finally, I notice as it warms up just how smooth and creamy the body on this beer is.  It's tremendously elegant even as it warms-- the alcohol does not get any harsher or the flavors any more difficult to handle.  I think I actually prefer it at room temperature, or very close.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

The aroma was strong with hops and mild malt.  The mouthfeel can best be described as ""Oh my God hops!"" that hit like a freight train at first then mellows our very cleanly into a more porterlike malt finish.

1482,"2003-12-10",3.4,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2004 Very hoppy stuff.  Dark brown-black, really pretty head, creamy, full, mocha-colored, hung around for a good long visit.  Nose very hoppy, lots of pine, a bit of citrus, some chocolate roasts.  Then the flavor comes.  Plenty of roasts up front, strong chocolate character, then theres a ludicrously strong kick of hops, all pine.  And I mean PINE.  No citrus, just pine and more pine.  I realize pine trees are part of Christmas and all, but this is ridiculously.  Palate-wise, this is again very special stuff, amazingly silky, feels great around the mouth, but I cant get past the flavor.  Its like somebody handed me a chocolate bar that, instead of being filled with caramel or nougat, its filled with fresh pine needles.  Literally.  Simply put (and I never thought Id say this), its just too hoppy for my tastes.  Hops are good, but they dont really match this beer very well.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
1482,"2003-12-10",3.5,"The Klaus poured a deep mahogany color that when held up to the light looked a deep cherry red. Head was thick and airy which slowly reduced in size. The aroma is an insane amount of hops that seem to be primarily cascade but I could be wrong. Really pine-like and reminding me of spruce and Christmas trees. Theres an underlying aroma of roasted malt and hints of cocoa or chocolate. This is definitely not normal. Think a cascade chocolate malt. Body is creamy and smooth. Flavor is most original in my opinion. Almost indesrcribable. Hops are really in the flavor and its taking me some time to get a grip on this brew. Theres a good amount of chocolate malt here giving some cocoa flavors along with the piney citrus hop flavors that are trying to blend. Im not sure whether they really do though. Has some uncomfortable bitterness in the finish. By the way, the alcohol is invisible but slowly kicking in.  Overall a very unique seasonal. One I enjoyed, yet one that puzzled me to no end.

I guess I'm more confused than anything else...this is one of those beers that just challenged me the whole way.","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"

Real nice nose. The flavor was mocha sweet and heavy but not for long...big bitter piney tone made for a unique surprise. The smoky and almost nutty undertone adds to the flavor complexity. The mouthfeel is syrupy but not really sticky, smooth and lush with enough carbonation from becoming too much. Dangerously drinkable, WOW!
