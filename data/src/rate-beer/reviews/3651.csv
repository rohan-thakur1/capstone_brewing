3651,"2017-03-10",4.3,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 2/25/2014. Pours hazy very dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, cherry, plum, fig, date, apricot, apple, red grape, sherry, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, bourbon, maple syrup, vanilla, peppercorn, toasted oak, and brown bread; with lighter notes of coconut, chocolate, cocoa, leather, tobacco, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Boozy aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Taste of huge raisin, prune, cherry, plum, fig, date, apricot, apple, red grape, sherry, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, bourbon, maple syrup, vanilla, peppercorn, toasted oak, and brown bread; with lighter notes of coconut, chocolate, cocoa, leather, tobacco, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/woody bitterness and bourbon/tannic oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruit, cherry, apricot, apple, red grape, sherry, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, bourbon, maple syrup, vanilla, peppercorn, toasted oak, brown bread, coconut, light chocolate/cocoa, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a fantastic malt and bourbon/oak spiciness balance, with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and full body; with a smooth, creamy/slick, and lightly syrupy/tannic/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden; a small pleasant warmth with a bit of booziness lingering after the finish, but not overwhelming. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged old ale. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the enormous ABV. A bit more boozy and sweet than previous releases due the higher ABV; but also less earthy/leathery and lacking the butterscotch notes of the past 2 100% BBA versions. More tannic/drying from the barrels. A highly enjoyable offering regardless.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

3651,"2016-06-10",4.5,"From notes. Enjoyed this one at the Brew Crew Bash in Ann Arbor on May 21. This one was poured from a 750 mL bottle. The pour is a dark, dark copper color, hints of mahogany throughout with a nice dark khaki colored head that falls to a wispy film. There is no lace left to this one. The aroma is, well a booze bomb right up front, but hey, its The Bruery, so of course it is. The molasses and brown sugars really come through with a nice maltiness. The whiskey is nice. There is a lot of vanilla in this as it warms. There is a nice woodiness and a light caramel as it moves through. The flavors match this one nicely. There is a good bourbon heat up front, and a lightly spicy rye to go with the sweet vanilla and caramel. The dark fruits move in and offer a great lead for the burnt sugars and molasses sweetness. The mouth feel is thick and viscous, with a nice soft carbonation that helps it coat the mouth beautifully. The aftertaste is complex and delicious. There is a lot of caramel, vanilla, molasses and a strong whiskey presence. Its truly a beautiful beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3651,"2016-05-01",4.3,"Silver waxed 750ml Sucre bottle (that only took a light degree of a Herculean effort to remove the cap from under the wax) pours with a dirty murky brackish brown mud that supports a nice dark tan head that has some swirls of lighter tan to white foam. THIS is a fine looking beer. The aroma offers up sweet supple malts and molasses and other residual sugar pillowiness as well as lighter notes of stunted and muted wood, marshmallow and a sense of boozy spirits with a wink toward whiskey. The taste almost cavitates across the palate with smooth soft sloughing malts and molasses followed by residual sugar coated wood and blunted chopped off at the knees- spicy whiskey notes. After several sips it becomes apparent that theres a mild warming sensation from the esophagus and heading south into the belly. As it warms a bit of plum and fig sweet dark fruity esters are noticed well off in the background. Terrific treat of a sipper.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Pours a murky reddish brown with a moderate sized, moderately thick, tan head that recedes somewhat quickly to the edges where it lingers in clumps.

3651,"2013-09-29",3.5,"Bois - Rye Whiskey
A steady pour into my teku glass produces a two-finger thick, pale brown tinged, tan colored head. The beer is a concentrated brown / amber hue that shows deeply hazed, lighter version of the same when held up to the light. The aroma smells of sweet brown-whole-grain bread, rich caramelized malt notes, nutty, sherry like oxidation notes, and then some spicy, whiskey like notes towards the finish add some bite and balance to the up front richness and sweetness. Brown sugar syrup, vanillin notes, and caramelized toasted coconut aromas combine to make this seem like some sort of rich, decadent dessert. As the beer warms up hot alcohol, spicy wood notes, and whiskey like notes become a bit more noticeable.

Sweet, rich, satiating, and dense as it slides across the tongue. The carbonation is light in comparison to the rich body of this definite sipping beer. The alcohol is extremely well hidden for a beer of this strength, and it ends up being quite smooth despite the alcohol and the Whiskey barrel treatment. The sweetness is tempered by the richness, there is a nutty, slightly sherry like oxidation, as well as an almost smoky, salty, peat smoke like character that lingers just a bit in the finish. Ample notes of vanillin and toasted coconut are accentuated by the caramelized sweetness, and there is a touch of spicy woody character in the finish, all of which are barrel derived. 

Once again, I am quite a bit more impressed with this Bois variant than I was expecting. The alcohol is so well hidden for a beer of this strength, it is still warming and alcoholic, but it is well held in check and drinks like a beer far smaller than it is. You definitely have to be in the mood for a sweet, rich beer though; a small serving is definitely a good way to finish off the night.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Thanks to our massive beer-pooling efforts and relentless attacks on the tasting table, we were able to amass quite a bit of each -bal aged Papier incarnation.  This was the best of the Papiers, with a heavenly flavor that is likely to result in a beergasm when you first try it.  Pours a muddy brown color with minimal head.  Its not very pretty appearance-wise, but the true beauty lies within, sort of like the girl Jack Blacks character dated in ""Shallow Hal.""  It is in fact one of lifes great ironies that this beer is the same color as crap, but its aroma and flavor are the exact opposite.  Not that I have ever tasted crap.  Aroma is amazing, with smooth rye whiskey, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, dark fruits, vanilla, and oak. Flavor has all these same notes, coming together incredibly well, with a strong but not overwhelming rye whiskey presence.  Smooth and almost creamy on the palate, with medium-full body, not too boozy but having great alcohol warmth. Carbonation is low but not nonexistent.  If you are going to pony up something super-rare to trade for a -bal aged Papier, try to make it this one.
