2844,"2017-05-19",2.9,"12 oz at Tupelo Honey. This is my first non-sour beer from Crooked Stave, so I wasnt sure what to expect. For some reason a hazy pilsner shouldnt have surprised me so much, though this is cloudy enough to look like a wheat ale. I fully understand that some pilsners in Europe are hazy like this, but its a little disappointing not to have clarity when presented with a lager, even a keller pilsner. The aroma is like raw hop pellets, its grassy with peppery notes supported by faint citrus and buttered corn flakes. The mouthfeel is a little slick, even chewy, and the finish isnt as dry as I personally like from the style. Towards the end of the glass, I can see the appeal here. The hoppiness is genuine and becomes juicy without being chalky. The malt character is nice and the flavor seems clean enough. But by the end of the glass, Von Pilsner is noticeably rough around the edges when compared to my favorites.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
2844,"2017-05-11",4.4,"Draft pour. The beer is a clear gold with a white head of foam. The aroma is bready and grassy. Lemony and zesty. Sweet and bready taste. Medium body and medium carbonation. Great pils, and done to style well. I expected it to be sour, and it definitely was not.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
2844,"2017-04-10",4.1,"Hazy golden color with a medium sized, white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Pils malt, grassy hops,earth, dry finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
2844,"2017-03-31",3.2,"3/23/2017 (draft at Lucky Dog Grille in West Chester, OH): Ive sampled this beer twice now at two different bars and its crisp, light, and effervescent with a tasty combination of grassy hops and hints of lemon. There is just a bit of yeastiness present to remind you that its not a standard Pils. I really like this beer, but its perhaps a bit too early in the season for it since my palate is still craving something heavier and richer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"
2844,"2017-03-31",3.3,"On tap at Redlight. Hazy golden yellow. Smells of pilsner malts and spicy hops. Tastes of spicy malts up front. Lightly sweet malts. Grainy. Spicy hop finish. Light and very drinkable. Not bad, but in the end it wasnt the most flavorful, even for its style.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
2844,"2017-03-08",3.5,"Draft. Poured clear yellow color with an average white frothy head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate balanced aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
2844,"2017-03-04",3.6,"on tap @ Vino Bellissimo / Lima OH --- Clear light amber with lots of effervescence, smooth, creamy white head that slowly drops to 1"", lace curtain. Taste is creamy malt, light fizz, light hops. Turns gradually sweeter in a long finish. Quite a distance away from my experience of Pilsners, but still a solid, complex brew.","Lakeside Park, Kentucky, USA","rondphoto"
2844,"2017-02-14",3.9,"Straw yellow color out of the tap with almost no head. Crisp nose of crackers and lemon. This is a very crisp, dry beer. Fruity, herbal with some lemon zest, and white toast. Quite tasty and refreshing.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
2844,"2016-11-30",5.0,"Got sacked by this beers delicious noble hop aromas. Compares favorably with another ""Dream Team"" collab, Firestone Walker and Russian Rivers STiVO, which is also a delicious keller pils, at least until the yeast sediments out and the beer goes ""flavor flat"".","Mountain View, California, USA","dpitinga"

2844,"2016-11-29",3.3,"From tap its lightly hazed pale gold with a short head. Quiet aroma shows hops as lemon and lychee and faint green-tropical notes. Malt is mostly transparent and fermentation is clean. In the mouth its light-bodied and sweet and oily with decent bitterness, but suffers from some gelatin-like chewiness. Easy drinking, uncomplicated lager.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
2844,"2016-11-08",4.2,"(En fût à la source): Comment ne pas être excité par une telle collaboration et la première reniflée se fait rassurante dentrée de jeux. Dun bout à lautre, cest laiteux, zesté, machable mais sec avec une verdure mature enveloppante. Une réussite.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"

2844,"2016-10-23",3.9,"Clear brilliant golden under a thin white sticky cap. Very beautiful nose I can smell several inches from the glass; grassy, earthy pepper, pilsnerish cracker tones and a gentle cotton whiff. Crisp, beautiful Pilsner flavors of crackery German malt and peppery grassy Saaz hops. Clean and slightly floral, a little bitter and nicely done all around.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

Similar flavor, adding mild malt sweetness and light hop bitterness (herbal, zesty). Light body with a crisp feel and a dry finish.
