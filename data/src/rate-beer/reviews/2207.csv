2207,"2017-01-17",3.5,"Draught @ Hayseed Pub: This one pours a darker golden color. There was a small white head and some lacing. Good nose. Malts and some earthiness. The taste is good. Malty, a little bit of spice and some earthiness. Nice!","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
2207,"2016-10-12",3.6,"Bottle sample at the source. The beer is a clear gold with a white head of foam. Aroma has Munich malt and big breach notes. Some honey. Sweet and breads. Medium body and medium carbonation.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
2207,"2016-10-05",3.2,"I guess its this check in, couldnt find any other ones that remotely looked close.
This was poured into a mug.
The appearance was a golden yellow almost burnt color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated quickly. Light carbonation rides upward at a fast pace. Head dissipates leaving some messy stringy lacing here and there.
The aroma takes on dried grassy hops over top of dried malty notes. Caramel, toffee and some nuts are there. Dried malty aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionable smooth malty feel to it. Low carbonation. Not cloying.
Overall, pretty dry for an Oktoberfest beer. Not sure if I would come back to as I think there are better ones of the style on the market.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
2207,"2016-10-01",3.4,"Bottle from Brewtopia. Clear copper with lasting head and lace. Caramel aroma with minerally earthy hop and a touch of booze. Sweet toasted caramel sweetness almost boozy bourbon with earthy grassy minerally finish. Medium body a little sticky and more alcohol presence than Id expect from an O-fest. Still good.","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
2207,"2016-09-12",3.5,"Sampled both ""regular"" and a special cask version at the brewery. The latter was more aggressively hopped, ruining the marzen maltiness (though still tasty!) but the original was a fine example of the style.","Houston, Texas, USA","dfinney23"
2207,"2016-01-30",3.5,"22 oz. bomber poured into tulip glass from the brewery. Aroma is bread with some champagne and sour yeast with a tinge of industrial lemon floor cleanser (not necessarily a bad thing). Appearance is clear, beautiful golden yellow with light sparkle, 1/2 finger-width off-white foamy head with poor retention and no lacing. Taste is lightly sweet malts with late mild tart and bitterness. Palate is light-to-medium bodied with thin texture and biting carbonation, dry crisp finish. Overall, true to style, though not as malty as one might expect, with some nuance that mostly works.","Fremont, New Hampshire, USA","tfontana"

2207,"2015-10-03",3.6,"Bottled in August 2015. Thanks Willrunforbeer on this share.light orange, clear in appearance, thin white head. Aroma is stale bread, toffee, mellow hop and lager yeast. With most of the Marzen style the only thing my palate picks up is yeast and stale malts. Which ultimately is what you look to achieve in the style. The mouthfeel on this is nicely.smooth and helps the overall enjoyment. Exactly as the style should be.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

2207,"2015-09-23",3.5,"Draught at Deep Ellum, 9/17/15.Very deep, bright/glowing amber with rusty iron tints and an off-white head that is medium-sized and sits at cover eventually. High clarity.Tons of caramel, toasted sourdough, honey, vanilla and light perfumey/herbal hops in the nose definitely tend towards the malty side, rather appropriately. No alcohol or flaws and has some earthy/hay-like notes as well from perhaps a combo of the grains and hops. Quite fragrant and sniffable.Sweet, for sure, in the mouth, though more richly malted and certainly not underfermented. At 6.3% its definitely on the high side of oktoberfests and obviously the strong maltiness as a result. Still, there are some toasted malt notes and herbal hops that help balance, but go a bit too far, building up that heavy sourdough-like breadiness on the finish, as the glass goes down. Carbonation is ample, somewhat helping combat the richness. Were definitely in to heller bock territory here and while its enjoyable and very flavorful, I think Id like just a little more sessionability out of my festbiers.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2207,"2015-09-19",3.7,"Bomber from the brewery.
Brilliantly clear deep golden color with a decent sized short lived tightly bubbled white head. Sweet sugary bready maltiness with hints of apple, light fruit and a faint floral spicy hop. A hint on the sweet side, but clean and quite tasty.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
