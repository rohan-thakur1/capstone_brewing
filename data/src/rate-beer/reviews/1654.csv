1654,"2015-11-05",4.5,"On tap at Firehouse Grill, arrived in a shaker pint.

Appearance: As expected for a stout, this arrived in the glass an impenetrable black, capped with a fairly thick tan head that lasted a while. Lacing was decent as I drank it down.

Smell: Unfortunately, this place had a kitchen, which always makes discerning aroma interesting. Fortunately, I was a fair distance from said kitchen, so I was able to do so. This beer smells sweet as can be, as though some burnt bread had been dunked in refined molasses and then slathered with marshmallow creme. Rather inviting stuff!

Taste: The smell didnt lie. This stout opens as a mouthful of dry, blackened grain and dark bread, much like a dry Irish stout, before the rush of other flavors surges in. Sweetness abruptly skyrockets, brought in by what seems like a mix of toffee syrup and lactose. Butterscotch notes mingle with hints of vanilla, and the Irish creme is definitely present in spades, mixing with the other flavor notes to form something not unlike marshmallow. Definitely a tasty beer.

Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with a decent level of carbonation, this drinks stouty.

Overall: Im a fan. But given that this is from Listermann / Triple Digit, that almost goes without saying. Ill repeat this one any time they choose to brew it.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"
