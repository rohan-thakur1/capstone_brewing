Bitter hoppiness and citrus notes harmonise together but are up against an underlying ""ashiness"" that seems to detract rather than add o the experience of the beer.

Rich orange, doughy head. Simple malty and meadowy aroma. Sweet caramelly malty body, dry noble hop bitter bite, but a fruitier finish too. Lovely long finish, in fact. Well balanced, and a classic UK bitter. Would love to have this cask, bottles can rarely compare to that.

What a contrast to The Grand Union Simcoe (see review) the hops were there on the nose but were presented in a very gentle wafting way, lovely floral notes. Some soft caramel flavours initially but with a nice hoppy background.

Gravicask at Reading Beer Festival. Wow. Well this one certainly stood out from the crowd. Glorious looking bitter signifies the intentions.
