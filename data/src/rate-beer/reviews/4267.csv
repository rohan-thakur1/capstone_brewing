4267,"2016-06-13",4.0,"On draft at Tired Hands Fermentaria. The pour is excellent. Its a crystal clear light golden yellow with a thicker white cap of head that falls to a thick film, leaving a good bit of lace. I never thought Id give a lager a 5 on appearance. The aroma is great. There is an excellent lemony citrus and a bright hoppiness. The malts are good and bready, but just light enough to let you know theyre there. The flavor is interesting. It starts off decent with the citrus and light malt, and then a hefty pepperiness kicks in. It finishes quite peppery and spicy with a maltiness that lingers on. Its not metallic, like Ive found with so many. The mouth feel is good. Its a little heavy, but well carbonated with a lingeringly spicy malt finish. This is pretty good.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
