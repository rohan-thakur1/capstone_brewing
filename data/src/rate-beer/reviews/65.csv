This beer is an experience, the bourbon barrels and the pumpkin spices and characteristics mix so, so well. I wish I had a stash of a million of these bottles so I could enjoy them whenever I wanted.

65,"2015-04-30",3.8,"Disappointing considering how much I like Pumpkinator and bourbon. Smells incredible, like spiked pumpkin pie. But the alcohol is way to hot and distracting. I bet it will soften up a bit and be great by next year. If only I could stash a bottle away myself -- which continues to be the most frustrating thing about the BB series.","Houston, Texas, USA","dfinney23"
