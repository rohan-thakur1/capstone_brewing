Smells of cinnamon infused milk chocolate, together with glazed caramel and a note of earthen, roasted coffee. The coffee inherits a wild berry quality, adding a light tartness to the rich maltiness. Its bourbon barrel blends perfectly into the adjuncts, enhancing the spiciness of the aromas, together with scorched oak, entangled into layers of soothing milk chocolate and the rustic coffee.

Has a lower carbonation with lots of whipped cream, creating a smooth, fuller mouthfeel. Turns a tad warm during the finish, due to the barrel, creating a warming glow after the swallow down the throat.

Tastes of caramel enhanced cinnamon spices, fudge, licorice and bitter chocolate. The coffee is less pronounced than the spiciness, lending an earthen sweetness to the flavors, which gets flawlessly picked up by the barrel. More chocolate, whipped cream and a warming dryness with a hint of booze create a nice complexity, leaden by rustic malts and sweet milk chocolate. 

Rich and fulfilling on the tongue, well balanced and highly enjoyable with a nice peak, created by the barrel enhanced adjuncts. The base beer is strong though, exhibiting a convincing taste foundation, which gets more complex, due to the adjuncts.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3459,"2015-10-03",4.0,"Bottle shared at the Moeder Lambic cellar session 2015. Pours black with a small beige head. Aroma of plastic, cinnamon, nutmeg, light coffee, dark chocolate. Flavour is moderate to heavy sweet and bitter. Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation. Decent but over hyped, not one of the best cycle stouts.","The Hague / Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","kermis"
3459,"2015-09-24",4.7,"From notes. Enjoyed on September 19 at Travis house. 22 oz bottle from Tommy and Chris I believe. The pour is a dark, thick, viscous black with a thin dark khaki cap of head and no lacing. The aroma is a cinnamon and bourbon bomb up front. There is a nice coffee that goes with a nice roasted malt, dark chocolate, and then the barrel kind of takes over on the back end. There is a nice charred oak and vanilla before giving back to the cinnamon and coffee. The flavor is Just as good. The cinnamon isnt as potent as the nose would lead on. Its still there, but the balance is a lot better in the flavors. Lots of coffee and a solid roasted chocolate malt. There is a lighter barrel presence but the oak and vanilla make solid offerings. There is a nice bourbon heat on the back end. The mouth feel is viscous and chewy. There is a soft carbonation to help this thing stick around. The aftertaste is lingeringly cinnamon and coffee with a light bourbon on the finish. Very good beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3459,"2015-09-20",4.3,"Bottle thanks Chris and tommy. Black color with tan head. Aroma is roasted chocolate and barrel. Taste is where the cinnamon shines! Loads of it and coconut and chocolate cake.","bloomfield, Michigan, USA","mikem409"
3459,"2015-09-14",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 18, 2015 bottle recieved in a trade. shared with a friend. had some very high expectations for this one. seeing those incredible high ratings. poured a black colour with a small creamy mocha head on top. a strong cinnamon aroma jumps the nose while pouring, covered by dark roasted chocolate, toffee, and sticky campfire bourbon in the end. burned caramel, and dark toasted malts. cinnamon is everywhere. and maybe the cinnamon was a bit to dominant. it doesnt get anoying. some chocolate puding, charred oak, and a faint coconut hint. slight spice pepper note, all flavors are perfectly balance. the only point that doesnt make this a world class beer is the mouthfeel. it was a bit thin. and it should me more sticky. but again.. this one is very very good!","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"

3459,"2015-09-01",3.7,"Bottle from Gabriel, cheers! Poured into a snifter. Color is inky black with brown hues. Medium brown head emerges and fades to a ring. Aromas are of an initial sweet sticky bourbon, followed by sweet black strap molasses, treacle, light coffee, light vanilla and a hefty dose of cinnamon. Taste has lots of cinnamon. Seems to overwhelm the other flavors. Not as much coffee as I expected either. Maybe it was my expectations that came with this beer but it fell short of being world class for me in the mid-palate and finish. I was hoping for a bit more body in the mouthfeel....a bit more creaminess...and a bit more balance among the profile. Given the ingredients, I dont get a lot of depth but quick flashes and undertones of coffee/earth/cocoa. Finishes sweet with doses of cinnamon and molasses, wet oak and bourbon. While this certainly was a tasty beer, it was not quite on par with the other Top 50 Imperial Stouts that Ive had the pleasure of trying.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"
3459,"2015-08-31",4.2,"22 oz. bottle, pours black with a small brown head. Aroma brings out complex whiskey barrels, cocoa and caramel. Flavour is complex, with whiskey barrels, cocoa and cinnamon.

3459,"2015-08-31",4.8,"Small head, to an extremely thick beer. Almost like motor oil.
Smell is heavly of cineamon and a tad of bourbon. 
Taste is sweet, but the cineamon takes over fast and the bourbon plays out well adding a vanilla taste with the oak and ends in a bitter dark chocolate feel. 
Feel is excelent, very smooth even it the flavours is so heavy
Overall a well executed beer, extreme balance considering all the things hapening in the beer. Would drink any day. 

Only minus is because of the head and that the cineamon was so heavy in the aroma. Which is pretty much good things.","Malmö, SWEDEN","Balderbitch"

The mouthfeel is unreal, and it reminded me of how thin some of the stouts are that I have been drinking lately. I wish I could drink this stuff every day.
