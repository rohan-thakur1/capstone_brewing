3607,"2012-04-07",3.8,"Hand pulled pint into a nonic glass in early Feb 2012: this beer is an autumnal rusty copper colour and comes complete with an off-white head of creamy bubbles. 

The nose is initially of malts, bready and baked biscuits; some hop fruitiness arrives as the beer warms in the glass. 

The taste carries on where the smells left off; malts in the foreground and the hops bitterness arriving later to give the beer a nice balanced feel. 

Yet another easy to drink beer from one of my local breweries; most enjoyable.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

Tastes a little thin though.  A good bittersweet balance and decent resiny hops in the mouth but its all just a bit lacking, especially by Salopians standards.","Wootton, Northampton, Northamptonshire, ENGLAND","maeib"
3607,"2010-11-27",4.1,"Cask conditioned at Far from the Madding Crowd, Oxford. Reddish amber (Sienna!!) with white head. Rich and full beer, there is a deep earthiness in the malt, granary loaf recently baked, then autumnal fruits, blackberry with a hint of elder on the nose. The hops give it a citric, bitter edginess. A bonus for my 6,000th rating, really very decent indeed.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"
