Conclusie: mindere neus, lekkere smaken voor de rest

My last rating on Beerbuddy/Ratebeer, going to Untappd as the last admin was calling me too shitty to search myself as I was helping to add this beer for the same reason as the last rating and barcode could not be found (after 50 ratings).

But 2° On the newer label (not the one above, Commissaris is spelled as Commisaris, and the database, of course, is unable to find that...  Good, very dense & fine yellowish head over clear deep mahogany beer. Caramel, marzipan, almonds, nose hampered by the dense head. Bitterish, leafy, caramel flavours. Even a point of acidity. Dry-ish, even with the caramel. Just some marzipan in the finish. Rather well-bodied, very slick but not thick. Once, long before Ratebeer, I described Uerige Alt as having an unparallelled bitterbite. Weve come a long way.

Citrusy and hoppy taste, much more different than what you expect from an Altbier, not necessarily bad of course. Caramel as well, some malts too. Quite bitter for the style.
