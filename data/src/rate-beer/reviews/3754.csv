3754,"2012-12-28",3.8,"750ml bottle (Alko Arkadia, Helsinki) - gift from John - thanks!
Pours a glorious hazy pale orange, and with a tight creamy white head - just looks beautiful in the (American goblet) glass. Superb aroma, its got things coming from all different directions - firstly a sharp light berry fruitiness on pouring, then in the glass theres a load of banana - thick, full and sweet - but also some sharp citrussy corriander and even an undercurrent of slightly medicinal clove. Crisp in the mouth, nice softness - a sweet fullness - but not sticky or slimy at all. Refreshing to be honest, and not saying ""strong beer"" at all, the fairly lively carbonation, and a real bitter bite, almost metallic, keeps the palate extremely crisp. Taste is focussed around the wheats, it has all the classic wheat components - firstly the simple sweat breadiness of it all, plenty of banana, more spices as per the aroma. Its only after swallowing that it really deviates from the aroma, the malt fades, but the hops are going nowhere, theyre refusing to budge. They tingle every surface of the mouth, and really clean the palate. Its antiseptically clean, if you know what I mean. Almost a metallic bitterness - my teeth now taste of battery terminals - I could probably light an LED if I were to bite on its leads. Once youre over the sheer power of the hops, dare I say numbed to it (that must be the clove I mentioned earlier), and you let the beer warm up a little, it is more inviting, smoother, and a little sweeter. I had also been swirling it to rejuvenate the head, and soften the carbonation, that helped it mellow  and sweeten a bit, so theres a nice toffeeness about it. ANd the finish tends more to orange and lemon zest. Possibly a little bit of a disappointment after the glorious aroma and look, but certainly not flawed at all, and basically pretty damn good all round. But the wow stopped too soon. Very nice to sip, I guess my 400ml will last about an hour.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

The beer is hazy and light orange colored with a thick, white head that leaves copious lacing on the glass. The aroma offers clove, banana, floral notes. Hops dont shine through as much as I expected, but instead, offer a subtle floral presence, more notably in the finish. Overall, a really pleasant flavor, most similar to a hefeweizen as opposed to a bock. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with just a hint of alcohol. This is a tasty beer, but not worth the $18.99 price tag.

Highly bready yeast character with the usual weizen esters, but the banana leads more towards mango as the Nelson chimes in. Surprisingly, the effervescence is not all that agressive, the biting mid-sized bubbles never agressing and not cutting completely through the cereals sugars.

Taste is ... well, take a really well-made (albeit a bit heavy bodied) Hefe, and add in some Nelson Sauvin. The result feels like something between an Hefe and White wine, with the best characteristics of both. The hops give something of a slightly dryer feel the beer, which is not THAT common on Hefes, but in the end, its extremely enjoyable. Now, theres no point to drink wine anymore.

Bubblegum, cloves, bananas and pineapples are tightly interwoven in this prickly and peppery Hopfenweisse. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam covers the clear gold.
-The tropical fruit aroma and flavors work admirably well with the Weizen yeasts  personality.
-The peppery hop resins in the finish are nicely bitterness, but not too much so.
-The mouthfeel is relatively dry, an impression perhaps enhanced by the intense carbonation.

3754,"2012-06-02",3.6,"Crown-capped champagne bottle  decants a lightly clouded light gold colored weizen in my glass. Decent puffy 2 finger cap lasts and laces. Light effervescence. Aroma is fairly modest but there is a defined wheat malt-fruit-clove aroma with an underlying vinous quality. Fairly sort moth with a light fluid character. Flavor is also demure but this is part of the intended character of this unique weizen  front side has the appearance of the standard Hefeweiss flavors, the clove phenols, banana-fruity esters and a light citrus presence  mid palate is where this beer becomes unique  instead of the standard hop bittering you get a mild tartness like raw white grape skin, not over powering but definitely present and this makes the finish not so dry but much like a white wine spritzer  fluid, tart but not puckering dry like most wiezens. Absolutely no hint of the alcohol in it. If this was the profile/character the brewer was attempting to produce, they succeeded in spades. Many will say this is a weak weizen bock but this ignores is unique mildness and vinous qualities.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

3754,"2012-05-30",3.3,"750mL bottle from the lyckbow. Pours a very hazy gold with a small white cap. The aroma is very fruity upfront, with some powder sugar, pale malts, loads of yeast, and some decent hops. Very sharp and perfume-y. Flavour is also a good blend of sweet, rich malts and dry, sharp yeast and hops. Blends extremely well so nothing stands out over everything else in a glaring way. Fuller palate, with a hint of booze. A lot of carbonation, which takes away from the drinkability a tad. Lingering sweet aspects, the yeasty esters dont have much staying power. Probably wont be buying this again but it was somewhat worth it this one time. Over-all a pretty decent beer, how I would imagine their regular weisse on steroids. Actually, now that I think about it, a beer on steroids is probably just bad for everybody involved....

Disig, djupgul färg med ett rikt skum som snart sjunker till ett fint lock på det flytande guldet. Aromen är kraftig av Schneider-jästen. Humledoften spelar långt ifrån förstafiol och kan inte mäta sig med sydtysk veteölsjäst när den är som tuffast. Det som vanligtvis brukar dofta åt krusbär eller vitt vin drar istället åt blommor och tropiska frukter, i huvudsak ananas. Jordighet och syrlighet från jästen tonar ner humlen således. Gott att dofta på hursomhelst. I allmänhet bjuder ju hefeweizen på en rejäl dos av fruktkompott, något som här accentueras av just humlen. Den som hoppas på en humlebomb blir besviken. Fenolerna dominerar, mest i form av nejlika men här finns också små inslag av plåt och rök. Oavsett vilka smakpreferenser man har kan man lugnt säga att jästen och humlen i det här fallet tar ut varandra något. Och kompletterar varandra. Det är ett riktigt gott och välbalanserat öl utan att nå den där riktiga toppen. Munkänslan är mjuk som vanligt när det gäller Schneider och kroppen är medel till medel-stor.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rickgordon"

Couleur dorée trouble avec une légère nuance orangée, col est crémeux blanc.
Arôme garde le profile dune weisse avec une levure qui reste prononcée et pas mal desters mais qui donne tout de même une très belle place au houblon Nelson Sauvin. Ce dernier laisse des notes typiques de Sauvin, cad un houblon noble fruité entre lagrume et le côté raisin blanc.
En bouche, la comparaison avec la bière originale sarrête juste au nom. Après avoir dégusté la version normale, la Sauvin apporte une fraicheur bien agréable au niveau des saveurs houblonnées qui de suite laissent séchapper une complexité fruitée notable. On y retrouve un palais huileux e ce côté de Sauvignon Blanc qui pour moi est une merveille et se marie bien avec le malt.

Nice fine applications of co2. Bitterness begins to build but never quite gets there. Never comes across as a higher alky brew, hides its alky content well.

Pours a hazy golden yellow with a big foamy white head that recedes quickly to a small soapy collar.

Aroma has lots of wheat character with bubble gum and banana sweetness alongside some light spices.  But the added complexity comes from the floral hops, lemongrass comes to mind.

The taste has the initial citrus and floral hops that give way to the more familiar Schneider wheat character - sweet bananas, fruity esters, hints of clove.  The finish is more dry and bitter than most weizenbocks.

The mouthfeel is lively and effervescent, light to medium bodied.

The look: Cloudy peach color body topped by a medium off-white head with good retention
In long: Nose is a mix of tropical fruit hops and german hefe banana esters.  I would not have guessed this was a weizen bock.  Taste is more of the same.  Nice banana cake make more refreshing with a hefty amount of tropical fruits hops.  Thats all I noted on this one and I had it twice, I drank my first one in 5 minutes so I ordered a second one for the rating which I proceeded to drink in 5 minutes again leaving very few notes in my notepad.  Well, I guess my two glasses speak quality about the beer even if not very descriptive.  However I dont think I would buy a bottle of this because a beer like this can only be as good as it is fresh.  There was an extensive list of draught beer at Wildeman on that day and ordering this new unknown beer fresh on tap was a very good decision.

Tavalyi kirándulásunkból leginkább arra emlékszem, hogy amikor beléptünk a nyíltkádas erjesztőbe, akkor összekoccant a térdem az illat leplezetlen bujaságától.
Egy valódi korty nehezen hozza ezt az eksztázist, kellemesen kiegyensúlyozott, sütis maláta, banános, szegfűszeges, finoman csípős élesztő, végül fűszeres komló, de nem az az ellenállhatatlan citrusos attak, inkább kicsit földes, keserű.","HUNGARY","tonycaviar"

The flavor is unique, and I like it. Tastes unlike any other Schnieder beer. It has a big wheat flavor which is nice but the flavor seems to be dominated by the hops which are an interesting choice to go with a wheat beer. It has a pleasant sweetness to go with the hops which are only lightly bitter. the hops are extremely noticeable in the flavor with a vinous light fruitiness with an almost flowery component. It definitely has more of a Belgian styled feel than Bavarian, but it is a mix of the two, and it works.

3754,"2011-10-26",3.1,"Tap at Churchkey. Pour is a murky orange  with watery highlights. No head or lace. Nose is mild detergent, lemon, with banana and apple. Extreme hefeweizen phenols with something like zucchini bread more so than banana bread. Nose moves to mango, then baked pear, then weird stuff like Tootsie pop candy. Very strange little beer. I think the yeast ester profile mixes with the Nelson Sauvin hops in a strange way that is a bit overpowering and confusing. Taste is rich malty, pear, tart apple, husky oatmeal grain. Small cidery taste. Interesting.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3754,"2011-10-26",3.9,"Draft at ChurchKey. Pours a murky gumwood color with a pretty frothy white head. Nose holds fantastic melon, apricot, banana, spice, and some very light hop bitterness from the Nelson. Really a delightful mixture of hefeweizen fruitiness with that sweeter Nelson/bock sweetness.

3754,"2011-10-18",3.8,"750mL bottle, courtesy of Mario from Brewed for Thought. Thanks, dude! Pours a murky orange color; fine-bubbled white head with nice lacing. Plenty of clove, white pepper, and vanilla in the aroma, along with slightly tart lemon and herbal hop character; light touches of alcohol. Medium to medium-full body; fluffy, pillowy carbonation; following the aroma, plenty of vanilla and white pepper yeast character along with some caramelized sugar and a pretty assertive, almost tart citrus and herbal hop character; the Nelson Sauvin doesnt show clearly in its typical form, but its pretty damn delicious overall. Lengthy finish of vanilla, toastiness, and some lasting mineral / herbal hop bitterness.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

3754,"2011-10-11",3.6,"Geruch von überreifer Banane. Der hefige und angenehm bananige Antrunk (weit weniger intensiv als der Geruch) ist vollmundig, der Hopfen lässt an Intensität abgesehen von der Fruchtigkeit aber vermissen. Im Hintergrund etwas herb, der Alkohol ist mit zwischenzeitlichen warmen Tönen vorhanden. Im Anschluss wird die Herbe stärker, die leicht klebrige Hefigkeit ebenfalls. Die Bananigkeit schwindet dagegen weiter. Zum Ende ist die Bananigkeit gepaart mit dunklen Malznoten erkennbar, etwas Zitrus.

3754,"2011-10-10",3.4,"Good dense, yellow head over hazy orange beer. Banana, limecitrus, if not much hops to be detected. Orange, very fruity. The hops are not obvious, but they change the character: very little clove, until the swallowing. Retronasal, one of the tasters detected the Nelson Sauvin once warmed up a bit (served ice-chilled!) - not me, however. Very spritzy, refreshing, and a typical wheatslickness constituting the body.  Tolle Idee, Hans-Peter  but I fear these hops are just a bit too subtle to have a true impact on such a bear. The citrushops from the Brooklyner might have been a more judicious choice.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

Hazy orange with a nice, fluffy white head. Pleasant aroma of fruit, banana, some yeast and bubblegum. The taste was very refreshing and fruity, it also reminded a bit of a white wine. Would love to try this one on a hot summer day.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","gyllenbock"

3754,"2011-09-24",4.1,"Bottle, shared with TMOH, for review, sent by Schneider. Thanks.
Aroma: Very traditional with the ever slightest Nelson Sauvin in the middle. Banana and a little doughy, nothing bad.
Appearance is great, this beer is definitely meant for a glass. WIth a amber orange and off-white head.
Taste: Nelson Sauvin isnt as dominant and is very vague, but the tropical fruits and peachy notes pairs extremely well with the banana flavours.
There is a very distinct notes of yeast that reminds me of the Westmalle Trappist beers.
Palette:  Body is medium.
Overall a great beer, definitely worth picking up once it hits the shelves!
Perfect for a hot day in the sun, so in that sense it is a kind of bad launch, but overall perfect beer.","Aalborg, DENMARK","Schytz"
