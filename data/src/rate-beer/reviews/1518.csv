1518,"2017-05-30",4.0,"Bottle, many thanks Werckmeister! Hazy yellow color with white head. Aroma is pure natural passion fruit, a touch phenolic and wheat - and I love passion fruit. Taste is wheat, phenols, straw, mineralic, dry finish. Medium carbonation. A bit green in the taste, but the aroma is absolutely lovely. Super refreshing. Great stuff, despite the slightly disappointing flavour after the perfect aroma.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"

1518,"2016-12-06",2.2,"On Tap. Weird bubbly carbonation, very litte to no head for a wheat. Seems off. Very dry, almost cidery, apple-like flavours. Some passionfruit is apparent. Very thin body, almost tart finish. Not your typical Wheat.","St. Pölten, AUSTRIA","pferdo"

1518,"2016-10-04",4.0,"Tap from Beer Store Vienna. Its amazing what passionfruit can do to a German hefeweizen. The aroma of this beer is pure passionfruit. I was looking for any hints of bananas which is characteristic of German hefeweizens, but nada, thats gone. But thats not necessarily a bad thing, because the mere introduction of the passionfruit birthed something new. Now I feel like Im drinking a fusion of a gose with some mild wheat beer and a very aromatic passionfruit that rules them both. Quite fascinating. Overall, the beer is quite citrusy, refreshing and dry and would work very well with greasy food.","","beersifter"

Tasty. Drinks very easy and fresh, while its very aromatic at the same time. Especially the nose is really lovely, bursting with various fruit notes. Perfect summer beer, among my favourite beers by this brewery so far.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"

1518,"2016-08-14",4.5,"From tap at Ottakringer Braukulturwochen. Cloudy, small white head. Very fruity aroma, mainly passion fruit, but also hints of banana. The lively carbonation and the decent acidity from the passion fruit add up to a very refreshing wheat beer. I really hope that this becomes one of the breweries regular beers.","AUSTRIA","alphabetsoup"
