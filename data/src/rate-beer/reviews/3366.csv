Aroma: quite intense and very good aromas of passion fruit, grapefruit, tropical fruits, mango. A quite high amount of malts aromas begin to show up in the background as the beer is swirled and warmed.

3366,"2017-04-06",2.7,"330ml can, filtered, from Tesco. Session IPA? At 4.8%? Either Americans have strong constitutions, or their sessions are rather shorter than British ones. Anyway, this is a rather thin malt for 4.8%, and feels more like a lager than an ale. The hops are crisp and citrussy. What is the significant difference between an APA and a a Session IPA? On this example it seems the malt is downplayed, and the hops are perhaps a tad more prominent, but essentially they seem the same. This is drinkable, but I prefer Sierra Nevada APA.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
3366,"2017-04-02",4.1,"[2nd entry in a ""why have I never reviewed this"" series]
Can - 330 ml. Pours slightly hazy light amber/straw yellow with a finger or so of frothy, fairly dense white head with some patchy lacing and a small amount of visible carb, large bubbles. Nose is pungent and juicy with strong hints of mango, passion fruit, grapefruit, blood orange and resin. Some cut grass and a slight petroleum edge. Sweet honey malt buried under all of this. Very juicy and slightly dank on the nose overall. Taste is bright, fresh, clean lightly sweet initially and quite strongly bitter for the rest of the time. Lots of bitter grapefruit with a bit more grass, giving way to chalky, mineral-y bitterness that coats the mouth but doesnt overstay its welcome. Body is light but not thin and watery, texture is smooth and silky, carbonation moderately sharp, which I appreciate in a session IPA, and the finish is of medium length and not too dry. Really good stuff, easygoing without being lacking in the flavour department like session IPAs can be sometimes.","Kent, ENGLAND","Cybion"

3366,"2016-06-01",3.5,"Reviewed March 23, 2014.

12 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a mildly hazy gold color. The head is a finger high, and eggshell in shade. Retention is mediocre, while only a small film of lacing is left behind.

S: Lots of hop action going on here. Onions, mango, papaya, cat pee, grapefruit, pine, and even some herbaceous tones here and there. Even some damn garlic - and you know what? I dont mind. Malts...well, they dont get in the way, lets leave it at that. This is stanky in all the ways I like an IPA to be.

T: It starts off with a lot of onion-y flavor, with just a light amount of fruitiness. Theres a surprising amount of sugar cookie in the middle. Im kind of sad that this isnt loaded with awesome tropical fruit flavors, just some onion and piny bitterness. However, this isnt so overly bitter as to kill this beer - the malt bill is quite prevalent here. Id even suggest its the least bitter of Stones IPAs. Not very complex, though.

M: This is substantial for a 4.5% IPA, and thats good. However, its just not as drinkable as Id like from the aforementioned style. Its nicely carbonated, but not very dry finishing.

O: If the idea of this beer was to create a small IPA that drank like a bigger one, then mission friggen accomplished. While this is a solid beer, Id rather pick up Stones regular IPA - its more interesting flavor-wise and priced the same. Worth trying anyways.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Stones Go To IPA fits the bill, packing a lot of flavor into an easy-to-digest brew. Its punchy with that characteristic stone dankness, alongside smells of pineapple and brussels. Orange makes an appearance with a little warmth, but not before. The touches of citrus are absent in the flavor profile, which is dominated by floral, hoppy and toasted bread notes.

Wow, after assaulting the nose, this beer grabs the tongue with two full hands of hops and then hangs on, long after the liquid has hit the gullet. Aroma clearly of tropical fruits and pine. Pineapple, mango, and piney. Golden to pale yellow. My beer was exceptionally frothy. Flavour was all upfront hops and then lingering bitterness. Then you realise it tastes just like grapefruit. Now dont let that put you off, as I dont like grapefruit, but his is amazing. It has all the tang and bitterness of a grapefruit, but somehow manages to still be nice. Its like there is a hint of another citrus fruit that just saves it from being too tart. So this beer is light on sweetness, big on bitterness with a finish on sour and a hint of salty at the end. 
Im a malt guy, but this is a Wow beer. Too big for larger lovers, but if you are after a hop hit - this is right up there. 
The beer is also 4.5% but comes across bigger and slightly alcohol hot.
Just way too expensive by the time it gets to Australia. $7 a bottle or $30 for a full six pack.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","DavidAust"

PALATE: full-bodied, explosively vibrant and strong in its aftertaste... light in its weight, with little suggestion of malt... a sessions ale, as targeted...TASTE: the dank, earthy spruce is here--strong, lingering and saturating... the mango and tangerine proves fruitful, while light malt presence ensures the hops are glorified--bitter and singular in its dank hoppiness... OVERALL: a beer that doesnt seek balance--and Stone doesnt seem to apologize for this either--and rewards in its singularity... difficult to believe that this is 4.5% ABV, given the amount of flavor packed into each sip--a joy to imbibe mid-afternoon, with no alcohol drag and a bombast of pine and citrus... an out-and-out win...","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"

Earthy pungent aroma with a strong summit/green onion presence along with earthy pine and dank resins. This is countered by sweet citrus and faint tropical fruit sweetness. Some pineapple and grapefruit along with a touch of mango/papaya. Nice balance of earthy and fruit notes but the onion-y summit presence is a bit overpowering and stronger than I prefer.

On the lighter end of medium body with a complex hop profile countered by a subtle malt backbone. Lots of earthy bitterness but not too dry with plenty of sweetness balancing things out. Dry and resinous with strong pine needle and spruce tip flavor. Grassy with some straw and spicy hops. Slightly vegetal with again a prominent summit/green onion presence. Not as strong as in nose but still one of the dominant flavors. Better balanced than the aroma with earthy bitterness, subtle light fruit sweetness and pale malt backbone. Some pineapple, grapefruit and tart lemon pith. Biscuit malt backbone with some bread, cracker and light fruit. Not overly complex or out of the ordinary but its a very enjoyable session beer that remains pretty drinkable.

There was a very nice blend of tropical fruit, citrus and pine aromas. Strong mango, peach and apricot along with some light grapefruit and orange zest and hints of pine. Only a very light breadiness in the background. Like the aroma, taste is tropical and citrus fruits. Mango and apricot to begin with followed by some orange and finishing with grapefruit bitterness which is lasting. Medium bodied with mid to high carbonation. Overall a very nice IPA from Stone.

Looks a bit lacking on carbonation, but the smell is definitely enticing. It has a big citrus hop nose as advertised, with fruity taffy notes and a floral tinge. 

The taste has the same citrus hop burst, and it really doesnt have much malt balance. It is clean, a bit watery, and where you expect that malt flavor to be, it is like it disappeared. The finish is nicely bitter, but still feels like it lacks something. The carbonation is actually fine on this beer, despite the initial appearance. Clean, light bodied. 

Stone definitely succeeded in what they set out to do here: a low ABV yet west coast hop intensified beer. I love the idea of a session IPA, though its hard to say if I love the finished product. Its very good, dont get me wrong, but just like some IPAs can get too strong on malt, this one borders on being too light.

3366,"2015-07-03",3.6,"This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a head of foamy fine to medium sized white colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a very softly carbonated slightly hazy light yellow orange colored body and a good lacing. The nice aroma was citrus and hoppy. The crisp mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a lingering hoppy aftertaste. The good flavor contained notes of citrus and hops.

3366,"2015-06-30",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 5, 2015 Stones ISA, with creamy, snow white, stable and sticky head over a deep warm golden blonde robe with quiet sparkling. Lovely hoppy aroma of chamomille, dried apricot, hay, lemon peel, unripe pear, dried orange peel, cedar needles. Very delicate flavour: a clean, crisp fruitiness to begin with (pear, gooseberry, unripe pineapple), soft minerally accents and even a slight saltiness, citrus peel fraîcheur over a dry pale maltiness, only very subduedly sweetish and announcing a long, dry, mouth-lining hoppiness, bearing lemon peel and pine resin flavours and leaving no residual maltiness.

3366,"2015-06-12",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
This refined Pale Ale showcases grapefruit and flowers in a bright and engaging profile which doesnt forget about sharing cracking cereals to support it all.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the shiny golden.
-The mouthfeel is silky and conducive to huge gulps.
-The hop character doesnt get overwhelming at any time.
-This is as well done as their bigger IPAs.... so I dont see myself drinking the 7%+ stuff when I can have it all at 4%.

A pretty well done ISA. The nose is stupendous - lots of bright, beautiful hops and just a hint of a supporting malt backbone. But the taste, while fine, falls a little short of the braggadocio of the nose, coming across a little thin, with a sudden finish. Its probably fair to say Stone didnt have a lot of choice but to jump on the session IPA bandwagon. And, its also fair to say that they did a pretty fine job of it. But, it might also be fair to say theyve got better beers, and Id probably rather take the ABV hit on a single bomber of one of their hop bombs, instead of drinking three or four of these. Usually.

3366,"2014-10-12",3.5,"Transfer from BA review on 3-13-14-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a light golden color with a one finger head of a pure white foam. The head fades rather rapidly leaving a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is quite potent in hop for a brew of only 4.5 % abv. The biggest hop smell is that of a grapefruit nature, but other hop aromas of a pine and a grassy smell are there as well. Along with the hop are some other aromas of a fruity nature with some tangerine, mango, and peach. A little bit of a doughy smell is there as well, creating a quite robust and nice smell for a modest abv. brew.

 Taste  The taste begins with a dry cracker base with some hints of a tropical fruit taste bringing just a hint of sweetness to the brew. Right from the start there is a nice hop flavor of a grapefruit and pine nature. As the taste advances the hop increases with the pine growing slightly stronger and with some flavors of an earthy nature coming to the tongue. While this occurs, the fruity flavors dwindle creating a rather dry taste overall. The grapefruit hop really starts to come on at the end of the taste, with it bringing lots of bitter flavor. In the end with all the hop, a lighter bready base, and very little sweetness one is left with a nice hop flavor, but one that is a little unbalanced and too bitter to be supported by the lighter body of the beer.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thinner side with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. While the lighter body and higher carbonation are great for the session style of the brew, they accentuate the hop too much in light of the very dry and low malt base, in some ways making it too bitter and unbalanced for a nice session IPA.

 Overall  Now this does give you a nice dose of hop flavor in a low abv. beer. For me however there was not enough base to balance the beer, making it a bit to hopped to be just overly hoppy in flavor without a real balance. It is nice if you want a session with lots of hop, but otherwise if looking for a truly enjoyable and smooth drinking session well.","","Darkmagus82"

New fangled weedy hops have overgrown the citrus, the needles, the fresh bright fruit. Garlic, crushed fennel seeds, celery seed and leaves, and bile-like green papaya. The starkness of these hops is too much for this style. The palate is lightly acidic, lacking the dry mineral content that frames the best examples.

The second may just be a first for me, but its a welcome change regardless - this session ale has more fruit flavor and balance than some of Stones heavily-hopped classics (which are also delicious, by the way). The aggressive blast of bitter grapefruit and pine needles is swapped for a juicy aroma and flavor. The aroma is ridiculously good with notes of lemon, grapefruit, apricot, orange, and peach. While not as juicy as that phenomenal aroma, the taste shows off the sweeter side of grapefruit and malt. An excellent, spicy pine flavor does its job without adding too much bitterness. Mouthfeel is as diverse as it is satisying - moderate carbonation, sticky hop oils, and wet hop sensations.

How amazingly redolent and I could imagine it will be a very memorable experience. Ill be thinking about this one again and again. There is something about a fresh hop nose slapping you in the face that will have you thinking about it the next day. This is one of those.
The bitter pine in the afterward is lasting, but not unpleasant, and the light, dry, body is only an invitation to another long swallow. Did I mention the very clear, light gold liquid and the sticky, thin, white head? Not the most important parts of this review, obviously.

Re-rated a few days later.  Not happy that I need to come back to this to make a different decision.  The second time around was less enjoyable, by far.  I found the apricot cloying, the pine missing altogether and although the aroma was still quite enjoyable, the long pulls were much more like a bitter and grainy aftertaste.

Pours a lighter burnt orange colour with a large thick and frothy white head.
Achhhh the aroma ..not my style of SIPA..lot of green onion and garlic, little pine..better..but not impressed.
The taste is a little better..but a bit on the resiny herbal side., bit of grapefruit rind...little malt.
Mouth feel is fine..that part is at least sessionable.
Greatly disappointed..i had changed my profile to put Session IPA as my fav style given the great session IPAs coming out of smaller breweries in Oregon.
THis is just average compared to those.
No idea why it has such rave ratings. Perhaps I got a bad bottle.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
3366,"2014-08-12",4.5,"One of the best Session IPAs out there. Ample white head. In your face grapefruit aroma. Color is yellow / amber. Taste explodes with hops and malt, carrying the grapefruit taste all the way to a clean finish. Another plus is the 4.5% alcohol content. Normally youb have to drink an IPA with twice the alcohol to get the same hop flavor. Meaning you could enjoy a few before its time to punch out! Well done Stone!","Illinois, USA","sharkbcr"
3366,"2014-08-09",4.0,"Sampled March 2014
A steady pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a two finger thick, pale, off-white colored head. The beer is a light amber / copper hue that shows a brilliantly clear, metallically sheening, rich golden hue when held up to the light. The aroma is just expressively hoppy with a mix of ripe tropical fruit / expressive citrus, and a dank, herbaceous character. Specific notes of guava, lychee, kumquat zest, super-ripe tangelo, juicy-fruit bubble gum, and sweet fruity floral nectar notes are balances by a bit of spicy woodiness, lots of dank, earthy, peppery herbal notes, a touch of mentholated rosemary type character, and just a huge hop character that is such a joyous expressing of humulus lupus.

The beer is light bodied, actually quite light, though not unexpectedly so, with a prickly, effervescent, light carbonation. The hop character is clearly the dominant note in the flavor, and there is also a significant bitterness to this beer. Due to the dryness of this beer the hop fruitiness is much reduced from the aroma, though it still manages to contribute a ton of flavors; guava, lychee, peppery tangelo zest, expressive kumquat zest are all quite noticeable. The herbal and woody side of the hop character is more dominant in the flavor for the same reason with notes of resinous pine, peppery woody notes, some turpene leaning rosemary like character, a bit of menthol, and a nicely earthy, dank herbal character that lightly forms a baseline note in the flavor.

This is a really nice beer; it definitely hits the mark for what it is trying to be, and it is nice that despite the hugely expressive hop character, it does not get overly harsh or unbalanced considering how light the body, malt character, and alcohol are. This is definitely a hop-lovers Pale Ale.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3366,"2014-08-07",3.3,"On tap at Salty Cowboy. A sour citrus aroma. A lot of tart hops bitterness that stays up front. The bitter lingers a bit on the tongue. Good, but for my taste I prefer an IPA with the hops bitterness balanced by something else.

Theres an abundant soapy head within the bottle that leaves a decent lacing, and I can tell the liquid is fairly clear, but cant tell too much else through the bottle, Stones reputation gets them at least the medium rating in terms of appearance. Its a medium high bitter with a medium sweetness to it. The body is surprisingly big for a session IPA - Id say medium full - with a waxy slick texture and active carbonation. It finishes dry and clean with notes of pine, citrus peel and caramel syrup. The aftertaste is bitter and dry citrus, but its mellow.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"
3366,"2014-07-27",3.9,"Appearance: Pours a vibrant clear yellow gold with a white sudsy head that quickly falls to a film.

Aroma: Bright citrus zest, skunky sativa strain medical marijuana. Those not familiar with that odor, I would say tropical fruit and a dash of cumin.


Taste: Quick punch of bitter Stone hops, some spicy Euro hop bitterness, some citrus rind, crisp pale malt. Mineral water. Finishes earthy and bitter. Lingers well past the sip.

Mouthfeel: Thin, juicy, average carbonation.

Overall: Since Enjoy Bys inception, I dreamt of an Enjoy By Junior for those evenings that I wanted to take it easy, or had to get up especially early the next day. This product completely met my expectations in that regard. It was refreshing, tasty, extraordinarily drinkable, almost too drinkable for someone so addicted to hops.

This was poured into a pint glass.
The appearance was decent semi-hazy golden light bronzed color with a one and a half finger white foamy head. There was a decent sticky foamy lacing.
The smell had some nice spicy connotations of a fruity/piney aroma trying to make a decent assault upon my nose. I will say, theres a decent grapefruit coming out lightly as well.
The taste was mainly spicy and allowing a somewhat gentle sweetness rolling underneath a sweet citrusy hoppiness and still allowing a gentle sweet malt base. The aftertaste and finish are dry and spicy.
On the palate, this one sat light on the body with a good sessionability about this. The carbonation was good and harsh for the style as it made a good pummeling on my tongue.

3366,"2014-06-22",3.5,"Bottle (12 oz). Hazy bright golden with a small diminishing white head and good lacing.

A tad sticky. Its quite sessionnable so the goal is achieved, but its a basic Stone beer, they can do better with hops.

This is resolutely fantastic. It is very dry, it reminds me of Ports Hop Tide, but mellower and more balances.

The best session IPA I have ever had, bar none. And one of Stones best beers too, I dare say. I like this better than their regular IPA, than Ruination.

Aftertaste shows the hops of course, but with nothing else, its sort of a lost effort. Overall, a decent session-based IPA at best, but the hops from dry hopping are evident in the aroma, but thats about it, there isnt much in the flavour or the finish to warrant another one of these.

3366,"2014-05-09",4.3,"Location: This rating is a combination of my notes from a draft rating as a guest tap at Gaslight (3/22/14) and a 12 oz bottle from Buy Rite (5/9/14, enjoy by 7/24/14)


Aroma: The aroma is clean hops, lots of pine, some mild citrus notes

Appearance: It pours a clear orange color with a small froth of white head and medium lace

Flavor: The flavor is lightly sweet, with a good amount of hops, clean and bitter

Palate:The body is light-medium, very easy drinking, clean, smooth, and dry on the finish 

Overall Impression: 
This is pretty much exactly what you want from a low ABV IPA. It is clean and very hoppy, it isnt watery at all, and it has a dry finish. What else would one want in this style?

Grapefruit laden citrus aroma and taste with the malts playing second fiddle throughout the tasting: this is all about the noble hop. Refreshing, bitter and thought provoking.

3366,"2014-05-06",3.5,"Draft pour on tap at Emporium (Chicago, IL). Pours a firm striking darker deep orange amber hue. Faint haze but near transparent as that deep orange glow flows throughout. Frothy whitish head atop stays as a decent layer, sticks around and laces well enough. Aromas are firmly hoppy, citrus and tropical fruit meet florals, touches of bread, more fruit, grass. Initial is medium bodied, a firm bitter hop element hits the palate, juicy fruit and tropical elements meet florals, citrus, and earth. A decent sweetness really hits the palate, fruity and integrated well but still a bit much for me in this particular style niche. Backend is still fairly bitter, lingering grainy and bready malts meet tropical fruit, citrus and florals. The nose is potent, the beer itself seems a bit girthy for the Session IPA trend but certainly is tasty. A solid beer albeit a bit misplaced.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3366,"2014-05-06",3.3,"12 oz bottle from Premier Gourmet in Buffalo, served in a stem glass.

The finish is long and bitter with a nice pepperiness. On the palate it is light-medium in body with a smooth, slightly dry texture and soft carbonation.

The toffee maltiness is super light and stays out of thy way of the great hoppy flavor. This beer is only mildly bitter and there is quite a bit of hoppy goodness (floral, passion fruit, grapefruit, pine, a touch of grass) without being just a hop bomb. This beer is lightweight with a slick texture. I like it a lot. I dont know how they did it, but they did a great job making an uber-flavorful and hoppy beer without it being too malty, sweet, bitter, or high in alcohol.

3366,"2014-04-17",4.0,"Enjoy by 5/25. $2.19 single. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint.

Appearance: Perfectly clear yellow color with two fingers of white head on it that dies down fairly quickly. A good amount of lacing. A lot of carbonation coming up from the glass as well.

Smell: Nice sweet hop aroma. A bit of dankness. Just a lot of pine, citrus, and a bit of mango sort of smells in here. Candied sweetness there as well that puts it over the top. Definitely the highlight of this brew -- it just smells incredibly refreshing.

Taste/feel: Actually a fair amount like the aroma. Go To has a surprising flavor for a beer so low in ABV. Theres a wallop of hops, but still a pleasant malt presence that prevents the beer from tasting like hop water, like I remember Founders All Day IPA tasting like (I should revisit that though). Just a great, fresh hop flavor. Wow. Like the smell, a nice blend of pine, citrus, and tropical notes. A solid to-be-expected IPA bitterness at the end, but its not at all overwhelming. Light feel, as youd probably expect, with very high drinkability.

Great beer to be sure, not just for the fact its 4.5%. $2.19 for a single though? I could just buy a sixer of Two Hearted for less and call it a day. I can see the time and place for this beer no doubt, but the price is too high for my liking.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

3366,"2014-04-11",4.2,"I think I like this trend of hoppy session beers way more than bourbon barrel aging every goddamn beer on the planet.

Orange pour, white head with big fresh aroma of citrus, mango, light pine, light toast. The flavors are bright, bitter, crisp and lightly sweet. The body is light, and with most sessions I find the body so light that its almost thin/watery, though Go To does a pretty good job of maintaining that threshold, but it is indeed present. The finish, much like the rest of the beer is bright and bitter. Overall its a great session, and as long as I can get get it fresh, I imagine Ill drink a decent amount of this summer.

I also dont find myself routinely wanting to drink 6+ pints in an afternoon so I guess I dont have as much need for a ""session"" beer.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"
3366,"2014-04-07",3.6,"Pours a clear straw color with a white head & good lacing. Aroma of citrus and grass hops with light malt. Flavor of pine hops at the start and citrus in the finish. Bitterness all the way through. Very good for a low alcohol IPA.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","osu97gp"
3366,"2014-04-07",4.0,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a nonic pint glass. It had a best before date of 5/28/14 and cost $3.15 ($0.26).

Appearance: Lemon-skin yellow hue over a clear body with visible carbonation. Pours to a small, white, frothy head which laces and retains well.

Smell: Interesting combination of various hops, with notes of lemon, cat pee and cannabis.

Taste: Stone Brewing is known for their huge hoppy beers. Though they do make a light beer called Levitation Ale, it never really caught on. With their new Go To IPA, Stone seems to have re-invented the so-called session IPA style. This beer is exactly what it sets out to be: a light bodied brew with the hop taste and bitterness you want in an IPA. 

Obviously, the hops are the stars of the show here. But this beer opts for hop flavor rather than raw bitterness. An interesting combination of hops as well. Theres notes of herbal or skunky/earthy character that gives it a saison-like spiciness. Lemon citrus comes through the middle, which is to be expecting considering which coast this comes from. Dry bitterness on the back end with a slightly starchy/pasty aftertaste, though it fades quickly. Overall, a genuinely flavorful beer that Ill bet would fool a lot of judges in a blind tasting as it can hold its own with any other standard IPA.

Drinkability: The problem with session IPAs is they can often drink like blondes with lots of hops. Stone Go To IPA, though light in weight at only 4.5% ABV, is not a light-bodied beer. Theres genuine body to the brew. The mouthfeel is crisp, but not thin or watery. Its refreshing for a moment as it crosses the tongue, though the bitterness does linger but its easily tolerable. I could see this being ideal for summer. The only problem: its not available in cans!","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Go To IPA pours a bright and clear light golden color with a very generous white head. The nose is very spicy, with an abrasive hop presence. The flavors are a little on the sour-hoppy side. I also sense a nice profile of floral and dry hops. Theres also plenty of pine and grassy notes.

Malt is quiet, takes a few minutes to coax a toasted grain note from the aroma. Fruity esters, malt sugar and juicy hop oils give it candy sweetness and flavor to go with a silty chew-able vitamin aftertaste. An improvement for Stone, much more oily and juicy than I remember their other IPAs, and not as astringent and chalky as the Pale Ale and Levitation.

As for flavor it had a mild but lingering bitterness with a defined taste of crisp and dry malts.

3366,"2014-03-26",3.6,"Bottling date was smudged, but super fresh anyway.
Appearance: Clear sparkling light golden body with a short and dense white head. Good retention, solid looking beer.
Aroma: Big hop aroma, dank with some pine, citrus, mango and peach. I get that unique Simcoe aroma in this, Id imagine they use it here.
Taste: The flavor doesnt quite live up to the huge juicy aroma. Dry and floral with hints of toasted malts. The bitterness is mild to medium for a beer of this ABV. Definitely something highly drinkable, but I feel like the hop flavor has been sucked out. I get some apricot and mango by the finish with a splash of honey, but overall this is just a dry floral and toasty flavor profile.
Palate: Light bodied, highly carbonated. Perfect for guzzling down.
Overall: This is another session IPA that has a huge aroma, but lacking in flavor, similar to how I feel about All Day IPA. The price really hurts as well, especially when compared to similar beers. A session IPA for $12 a 6 pack? No thanks. Nice to drink though.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Still, I sampled the Stone IPA immediately afterwards, and I think this one has more flavor.  Aroma is a good kind of funky with BO, fruit, and lots of pine.  It loses the depth and taste longevity, but the flavor is pretty good, and more of it up front than their original IPA.  Fades quick leaving a hollow bitterness with some of the funk lingering.

Aroma is abundant in floral and citrus hops, smells very hoppy but not potent. Taste is just the same, really great hop profile but doesnt finish bitter with a light crisp finish.

Grass, citrus flesh, mild green onion, cracker malts, pine, a hint of bitterness, a touch of tropical fruit, leading to a relatively dry finish. Crisp mouth feel, very light.

3366,"2014-03-18",3.7,"Bright yellow color with a full white head - looks like a good German Pilsner. The nose turns that perception on its ear, as it is a wonderland of grapefruit, pine and resin aromas. The flavor is a bit more subdued, with strong echoes of the flavors listed above. A nice crisp mouthfeel, with a very dry finish. The only thing missing is the alcohol - otherwise, a perfect west coast IPA. Perfect for day drinking - on an aside, my pilsner-loving, craft-hating wife thought this was really good - high praise...

Pine, some light grapefruit citrus. Some light resin in the finish. Definitely a satisfying, big amount of hops, if thats what youre craving. I had high hopes for this, and I think it hit the mark. I was looking for a light but intensely hoppy session IPA, this delivers on that premise, where Great Divides Lasso fell a little short for me. For those turned off by the assertive bitterness and light hop bite of this beer, Id direct those to try Lasso. This Go To holds no stops in the hop department, but it also has a very satisfying malt bill that I enjoy just as much. A good clean but noticeable bready backbone to it, lightly peppery. Moderate to bigger bitterness, very little sweetness -- more of a dry finish. Light to medium body. Very smooth and easy-drinking, and even more so once its had a chance to sit and warm up for 20 minutes --- a great characteristic for a session beer to have. Great stuff, super easy-drinking, and very satisfyingly hoppy. The bigger bitter hop bite may be the only knock some may have on it (not of me). I could drink a lot of this. In fact I originally sat down with 10oz to rate it, I had to get back up to get 10oz more... Points for that. Cool job Stone. Itll be interesting to see how this sells at $11 a 6pack though, especially with cheaper competitors.

3366,"2014-03-10",3.6,"12 ounce bottle purchased from Corti Brothers. The aroma on this is very pungent. I get citrus fruits, like melon and some onion character, too. Perhaps some earthiness. Curious as to what hop they used to dry hop this with. Transparent yellow body with a small, white head present. Starts with more hop flavors...earthy, mushroom like flavors. Malts are restrained and subdued. A little bland in the middle, before a moderate hoppy bitterness comes through in the finish. Herbal finish with more earthy and a little oniony flavor. This is a well-crafted brew, but I am not a huge fan of the hop bill that was used in this.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

Aroma is definitely very hop forward, mostly good with heavy tropical fruits, but there is this odd lingering almost onion aroma Im picking up that throws me off a little bit.. Taste is nice, fruity, pine, bitter, mouthfeel is nice and refreshing. Not too bad, i will try again soon and see if that onion funk is there still or not.","Newark, Ohio, USA","mikesaum"

Still love it though.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
3366,"2014-03-10",3.8,"Pours a clear pale yellow with little to no head, a simple white ring of bubbles is all. Aroma is awesome! Smell is sweet of oranges, peach, and bubble gum, yet distinctly hoppy, Taste is grapefruit juice and pineapple with loads of evergreen thrown in. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but then again I suppose with a lighter-grain bill then a typical IPA this is to be expected. Not incredibly well balanced (and Stone is upfront about not trying to be) but yet the beer does sort of tie together cleanly towards the end of the sip with a slight sweetness and then lingering bitterness to finish. Crisp. Love the low ABV%. A winner from Stone I will drink this more often if I can find more.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","rayg1"

Poured a golden clear color with two fingers of frothy white head. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom. Average layered lacing along the sides of the glass. Very good retention on the top all the way down.

Smelled a potent whiff of citrus hops and floral hops. Got grapefruit, grapefruit rind, tangerine, orange, piney, caramel and light honey. Pretty bitter overall.

Tasted not quite as good as the smell, but still good nonetheless. Got floral hops, citrus hops, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, grapefruit rind, piney notes, orange pulp and caramel notes.

Light body. Creamy-to-oily texture. Average-to-lively carbonation. Abrupt, bitter finish. Fairly refreshing.
