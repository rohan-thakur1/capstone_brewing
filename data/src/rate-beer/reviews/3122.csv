3122,"2017-02-25",4.1,"(750ml bottle at the brewery) clearish light gold, fine white bubbles. Nose of rich peaches, lacto, oak, typical de Garde funk profile, very juicy. Taste is even better, lacto, oak, very juicy peach, quite sour, lemon, tart, not overly complex and leans towards sour versus juicy but it has both. Medium Carb, nice tart finish. Perhaps a bit one dimensional but nice.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"

3122,"2016-12-29",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2017 From notes. Enjoyed this at Mickeys 30th birthday bash on November 05. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a darker orange color with a thick white head that recedes slowly, without lace. The aroma is all peaches. There is a light cognac and a hint of funkiness to it, but its just like damn peach juice. I love it. The flavor is much of the same. There is a light oak influence and a hint of cognac on top of the peaches, but they are definitely front and center. Tart and crisp peach juice. All flesh and delightful. Son of a bitch. Mother fucker. Sour peach flesh. Crisp, clean, sexual. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly juicy and wonderful aftertaste. This is a damn good beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3122,"2016-11-05",4.5,"Hazy dark orange color with beige head. Aroma is full of apricot marmalade, dried apricots and a nice cognac note in the background. Taste starts really sour up-front but also with lots of apricot flavor and a cognac sweetness in the back. I know its made with peaches but for me it tastes more like unripe apricots. Medium body, extremely dry and sour, good carbonation. Overall this out an excellent beer. Really sour, fruity, dry with the extra cognac complexity. Excellent.","Timisoara, ROMANIA","ciocanelu"

In the glass it has tons of fruit notes...peach, lemon, strawberry...marzipan, cherries, light oak and some grand mariner. Also some acetone as it opens. Slick mouthfeel with ample carb.

3122,"2016-01-31",4.1,"750 ml bottle to taster. Looks good; a very cloudy darker apricot with thin eggshell head that dissipates into lacing pretty quickly. Smells good too; semi-tart, oaky, and funky alongside a well-balanced peach presence. Tastes like it smells, but even more peachy, with a pleasantly lactic medium-bodied mouthfeel. Delicious!","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
3122,"2016-01-06",4.2,"Poured from a bottle. Aroma has a medium light cognac note with some nice vinous character. Medium light acidity with some light oak notes. Moderate tropical fruit with some pineapple. Medium light peach notes that are a bit hidden by the cognac barrel character. Pours a hazy, copper orange with a medium sized, thick, white head that shows decent retention as it recedes to a thin film that lingers, thicker on the edges. Flavor is moderately acidic with quite a bit of cognac character with nice vinous notes. Some moderate peach notes with light oak. Moderate tropical fruit and citrus notes. Light bitterness. Nice fruitiness, but the peach doesnt stand out the way it does in the Biere Peche. Acidity is a bit sharp, but not too bad. I really like the way the cognac works with the peach and tropical fruit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall, a nice, tasty beer. Good cognac, peach and tropical fruit character with some light oak. Moderate acidity, somewhat sharp, but not too bad. Nice vinous notes.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Big beautiful fresh fruit nose, very little competition from any ferment or other quality, just a pure showcase for the peach. Creamy medium body with lively carb. Gorgeous mouth-watering fresh peach flavors from the attack across the mid palate to the finish; the finish is especially reminiscent of a bite of fresh fruit.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
