Barely a pop. Small white head atop a mostly clear body.

Nose is herbal. Funky. Less acidic than a Cantillon usually is. More in the 3F vein. White pepper in the back.

Taste is back to the true Cantillon sourness. Strong white wine notes and it gets herbal again after the sourness fades. The finish is far less acidic.

 Medium bodied. Strong wine presence that takes away from its spritz.

349,"2016-06-10",3.3,"From notes. Enjoyed this one at the Brew Crew Bash in Ann Arbor on May 21. This one was poured from a 750 mL bottle. The pour is a foggy golden straw color with a thinner off white head that falls down to a collar, leaving no lace. The aroma is pretty harsh. There is a lot of dusty barnyard right up front. The hay, tart fruit skins, and a sharp earthiness really add to a decent complexity. It doesnt mean that its the best thing, but its complex, thats for sure. The flavor is a little sharper. There is a strong vinegary presence, and Im not feeling that at all. The dusty barnyard hangs out and there is a little lemongrass to it as well. There is a light souring to it, but it really is harsh and acidic. The mouth feel is light bodied for sure, with a bright carbonation that is almost a little too much. The aftertaste is lingeringly funky and carries a light tartness to go with the dustiness. Glad I got to try another Cantillon, but I think I would pass on this one in the future.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3.5 A: Lightly hazed yellow orange color. A little over one finger of frothy white head. Retention is about average and no lacing is left.

4.5 S: What an enticing aroma this has! It smells like the fresh outdoors. Wildflowers, jasmine, running water through a forest, melon, apple orchard. Hay to a lesser extent along with rotting wood. Not very acidic, which isnt really the Cantillon way. Perhaps thats why I like it so much. Fresh outdoors funk with just mild lactic acid. Supremely pleasant. 

3.5 T: Theres more acid in the taste, but its still low for Cantillon - mainly lactic, but also some acetic as well. Herbal bitterness, lots of jasmine again, with a big woody type funkiness. Again wildflower and apple orchard. Sour apple and unripened peach. Hay, dried out campfire wood. Theres a decent amount of astringency in this and its a unique type of astringency, which I will call an acid astringency. Still, pretty good.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Neither spritzy, nor creamy, but it works well enough.

3.5 D: Its definitely one of the funkier Cantillons out there. Its good, but 3F does it so much better. Still, worth a try.

Yields a cloudy, vibrant orange color, with a huge, froth head.

Offers a huge amount of grassy, american hops, giving the beer a unique note, which provides more depth, due to herbal, matured hops. There is a layer of subtle tartness underneath the hops, quite funky, together with leather, yogurt and a whiff of glue. The nose comes perfectly together, between sourness, grass, bitterness and even a fruity indication, leading to a fantastic aroma. 

Has an incredible soft mouthfeel to it, with a fitting carbonation. 

Tastes of leavy, grassy hops with a decent amount of citrus peel, bread and an enjoyable tartness. Blends perfectly into the slightly metallic, lively carbonation, unfolding matured hops among grass and acrid herbs. Finishes with a lively dryness and old hops, while a lot of the grass is still there, evoking an almost fruity impression as the malts tend to get a little sweeter.

As there is a belgian IPA, this in my opinion comes closest to an IPAed lambic . Dont get me wrong, this is unmistakely a lambic, but the hop integration is pretty much character defining. The beer has a highly unusual taste for a lambic, coming incredible well together, with hops doing a huge part of the work, among your typical cantillon lambic foundation. Very rich in flavor, the beer emphasizes a lot subtle flavors, cutting through the matured hops. Reveals a perfect interplay between sour and bitter.","GERMANY","aleigator"

CuvÃ©e Saint-Galloise purchased @ Mi-orge Mi-houblon - Arlon - Belgium. 
Bottled @ the 17th of February, 2014.
A: Beautiful art, first of all. Cantillon trademark. Corked and capped bottle. Pours a hazy light orange color forming a thin but very fizzy and big bubbled white head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacings at all
S: Very malty and fruity. Very complex. Let me try to describe it: Notes of sweet malts, vinegar, grapefruit, leather, orange zest, honey, peaches, wet grass and flowery hops. A bit earthy in the end
T: Also very complex. Slightly sweet upfront becoming quickly, tart and funky. Moderate sourness, nevertheless. Notes of pale malts, vinegar, grapefruit, leather, orange zest, honey, peaches followed by an absolutely great hops bitterness and finished by some metallic and earthy notes. Lambic yeasts
M: Smooth, bit creamy and a bit molasses body. Fizzy ""alive"" carbonation. Malty/funky aftertaste
O: Perfect drinkability. Quite hoppy and bitter if compared to a classic Lambic Gueuze. Very unusual and interesting. IMHO, Cantillon is the best brewery of all times...

349,"2014-05-02",4.3,"Ive had the pleasure of trying many iterations of dry-hopped Cantillon lambic- from the exemplary variants (Bier Circus Cuvee du 89, Monks Cuvee, Pikkulintu) to legacy Cuvee des Champions, to the current Cuvee St. Gilloise, the use of dry hopping makes for a very tasty and profound example of the possibilities of lambic production melded with other brewing staples. Hops tend to fade sharp and fast, however even in the decade old renditions, there is still evidence of the bitterness and hop oils present. Hazy, translucent pour with a nice head and minimal lacing, heavy acidity and slick profile from residual hop oils..Very similar to the single cask two year lambic, Cuvee combines the flatness of jonge lambic with the budding funk and acidity that comes with age.

Smells of tart, sour lemon and yeast. Notes of vinegar. 

Confronting - not for the uninitiated! Smooth lemons upfront, funky farmhouse fruits that dry out over the tongue. The hops suck the moisture out of your mouth on the way down, challenging, but becomes very enjoyable as the drink opens up. 

A light body with a lot of carbonation.

349,"2013-07-14",4.0,"The appearance is beautiful overall with the orange colour coming fromthe significant dry hopping. The aroma has a mild peppery and spicy hop aroma with a bone dry almost Champagne like aroma with tons of hop nuances. A light barnyard funk pervades the aroma with noted tart lemon fruitiness and acetic sourness. Although I have had many different gueuze the aroma always surprises me with its acidic backbone and tart, dry notes. The first sip I take has an intense citrus fruit to the point of puckering tartness until a mild oaky creaminess settles the citric flavour down a bit. The finish is crackingly dry with a mild bitterness from aged Golding hops with nice solid sourness. Funky fruits and barnyard yeasty esters are rather subtle as the acetic acid, dry hops and citrus fruits are much more abashing on the palate. Overall a nicely soured, complex Gueuze with a creaminess that balances out the dry, acidic flavour profile.","Alberta, CANADA","patricks110"
349,"2013-07-12",3.8,"On cask at Chez Moeder

Trying Cantillon on cask was an interesting experience. The normal aspects are replaced by the stillness of being on wood. For this particular beer it works decently although I would still much rather have a bottle.

Aroma / Appearance - The bronze base is masked by a cloudy nature as if overcast. Starchy and peppry, it has the feel of a bone dry champagne. Icy lemons spread over a generous piece of cheesecake give it a gueze feel but not that familiar vinegary bite.

Flavor / Palate - The oaky aspect of the cask leaves a mild bitterness on the tip of the tongue. It is then washed away by the combination of hops, lemons, and light tartness. The creamy nature of the mouthfeel is similar to drinking a lemonade based smoothie with floral hints. This is a fine beer overall but at least on cask not the best.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Murky yellow with a typical Cantillon filmy white head, glowing color just entices the tongue... you know whats coming, palate killer city.  First taste is extremely sour and punchy, with the flavor of acidic roasty corn, with burlap and wood in the nose - to put it frankly: awesome.  Subtly smooth texture, with some scorching acid and tart crackers on the back of the tongue, bread and other farmhouse qualities.  A really wonderful gueuze, and a highlight of the RBSG tasting for me.


Cuvée du 89 - Bier Circus, Brussels, May 2006.  This is the version of Cuvée des Champions which is dryhopped with a different hop than normal.  It is made for the Bier Circus, and they offered both 75cl and 37.5cl bottles.  Slightly murky, bubbles rise up to a medium-to-small sized head.  Strong, raw, almost ""rancid"" nose, very rough and raw on the olfactory senses... lovely.  Very fresh and puckery sour flavor up front, syrupy even (slightly).  Intensely sour, as is common with Cantillon, has a very young quality to it, you can still taste the raw ingredients... but definitely you can tell that this is not a normal gueuze blend.


2003-2004 bottle opened in May 2009.  Weird almond and cork scented nose.  Strange oiliness to the body, slimy and filmy almost.  Seems darker than I remember.  Still good but seems like this bottle or vintage may have lost something.

349,"2012-06-16",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 2, 2015 Had it several times from bottles (750 ml) and draft fresh and with a few years on it. 

Appearance: Hazy golden/orange with a small fully lasting white head and little lacing.  

Aroma: Lemon/citric presence are dominant, but well balanced by the floral hops. Theres also plenty of barnyard as well as hay, oak and brettanomyces.  

Taste: Quite lemony/citric here too. Moderately sour. The floral presence is just enough to create a good balance. Theres also oak, barnyard, hay, brettanomyces as well as light bitterness.

Palate: Light to medium body. Soft/moderate carbonation. A tad oaky mouthfeel. Mild lingering lemony and floral finish.  

Overall: The lemony character of the Cantillon lambic is well balanced by the hops in this one. Even when fresh, the hops are never overpowering.

349,"2012-05-14",4.5,"750ml, bottled October 04, 2010.  I was surprised to find that at 1.5 years, and despite what I deem to be proper cellaring, the cork on this puppy was half way saturated and almost too soft to pull.  Still, it came out clean.  The pour yields a very slightly hazy, glowing, golden-tangerine amber body.  Neverending streams of fine bubbles feed a fuller than usual (for Cantillon) head of lasting, eggshell tinted foam.  Short, rounded flares and spots of lace slowly meander back towards the body.As expected, the nose is drop dead gorgeous.  Nobody captures that musty-sharp apricot perfume note like Cantillon, and this one is no exception.  The Hallertau hops lend a perfectly restrained, grassy, hay-like bite.  Of course, theres the requisite buggy, woody farmhouse funk, but it too seems relatively soft thanks to fruity and cereal-like malts.  Its incredibly saison-like, and nods to a few exceptional American beers that Ive had lately, most notably Upright Fantasia....only better.  I guess the nod really goes the other way then, doesnt it?The flavor follows suit, tart and sharp, mouth-puckering at times, but also reasonably subdued thanks to the leftover malty sugars.  Concentrated apricot sour is the most prominent element, followed by hints of lemon and dried pineapple (a brettanomyces signature).  German hops again add just the right amount of grassy, leafy, bitter bite. Damn tasty.The palate is a little bit creamier and heftier than most gueuze, but still exceptionally dry, with crisp, prickly carbonation.  It is exceptionally drinkable.  Overall, Cuvée Saint-Gilloise falls just a bit short of its masterful cousin, Cuvée des Champions, but Im really splitting hairs here.Lately, in my mind, Hill Farmstead has been in hot pursuit of the title ""Worlds Best Brewery.""

Courtesy mgumby10.  Pours a hazy tangerine yellow color with a small, fizzy, bubbly white head.  Jagged columns of lacing protrude from the body like solar flares do from the sun.  First sniff.....WHOA!  This smells fantastic!  Strong notes of sour apricots and nectarines, two of my favorite fruits, explode into the nose.  Fresh squeezed grapefruit, mild farmhouse funk, and lightly sweet candy sugar complete the aroma.  The first sip stands behind the promise that the nose makes.....this thing tastes great.  Funky as hell, sour, tart apricots and nectarines dominate again.  Grapefruit is present again, playing more of a background role.  Mouth puckering, but not as extreme as some other Cantillons.  Balanced perfectly for my palate.  Moderate carbonation levels match the dry, medium body perfectly.  This is a mind-blowing beer.  Second only to Kaggen (amongst dozens of incredible beers) at the infamous Merritt Island Throwdown, March 2008.8/4/9/5/17 = 4.3.  Cantillon cuvee du van 89.  4 years old as of summer 2009.  Exclusive 375ml for Le Bier Circus in Brussels.  Im told this is the Cuvée des Champions with a different dry hop billing.  Pours a hazy, medium golden-amber hue with fine streams of micro-bubbles that effervesce towards the surface, pooling into a thin but steadfast head of pure white foam that lasts for the duration.  Just a few spots of sticky lace remain behind.  The aroma is beautiful, steeped with sour apricot and peach notes amidst citric acidity and strong, woody oak notes.  The requisite horseblanket funk is there, though the residual lemony grassiness from the dry hopping cuts through it well. Flavors are equally delicious, strikingly sour with notes of lemon, apricot, peach, and nectarine. Though not the focus, the grassy hops lend just a bit of a resinous bite that really works. Mostly dry, tart, crisp and slightly puckering, with a nice and subtle hop finish.  Fantastic brew.  Cantillon rules!","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

THIS beer Certainly is fucking awesome.  The nose isnt big and potent, but has many phases of subtle shit that transitions into different shit as  warms this beer.  Many dimensions to this one, is what Im trying to say.  like 10 or 26 or some odd dimensions.  What Im trying to say is that it would be quite difficult to find a theory or model that accurately portrays all of the small subtle and large exciting things going on at the same spacetime of this beer.

349,"2012-03-12",4.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 9/26/2011.  2010 Vintage. Poured from a 750 mL corked and capped bottle into a tulip.

My pour has a cloudy tangerine orange color with a delicate white froth. The head only remains for a minute before fading to a ring and a thin film, but it still leaves a few wisps of lace.

The aroma is full of barnyard funk, horse blanket, and leather. Slightly musty as well. There is some good tart acidity to the nose. Tons of Brett in this one.

The flavor is pleasantly sour, blended, and balanced. Some light grains prelude lemon zest and a little grapefruit sour flavor. Some straw and grassy notes draw out the flavor, and the finish has some musty earthiness. 

This is acidic, with some lactic character. Fairly dry, medium bodied with delicate carbonation. A bit more dry at the finish.

Bottle shared with random American I met at the bar.  Pale golden beer, creamy head.  Incredible aroma classical Cantillon sourness, grapefruit/lemon and heavy funkiness and acidity.  Apricot and peach with some strong lemony citrus notes.  Fruity and fresh.  The hops appear to have diminished somewhat, but they do play off the typical fruitiness that Cantillon has.  Assertive sourness.

T: Honestly, this was a bit of a let down after the nose... but upon further reflection this was quite delicious. Sour lemons, some lactic tartness, straw, oak and barnyard funk. Not quite the same level of complexity and layered depth as the nose.

Cuvee St. Gillouise 2010 vintage, consumed September 2011: 8/4/8/4/16= 4.0
A:  Golden-orange body with a large, bubbly white head.  Just a few streaks of lacing left after each sip. 
S: Bright citric blast up front--a combination of lemon acidity and general citric hoppiness.  A nice marriage between the two.  Mild oak and funk toward the back-end. 
T: Cleaner flavor profile--less funk and earthyness and more citric notes--than older bottles of cuvee des champions.  Part of it is the freshness, but I think part of it is the recent trend of Cantillon lambic becoming a bit sharper and more citric-acidic than before.  
M: Soft acidity, moderate sourness, effervescent but not overbearing carbonation, medium body.
O: Its a nice product, but I certainly prefer the more barnyardy cuvee des champions.

349,"2011-12-05",4.3,"My Bottom Line :  
Peppery oak, white grapes and grapefruity hops ride this Gueuzes fine effervescence, while precise brettanomyces funk adheres to the fruity vivacity. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A sheet of foam covers the cloudy beige.
-The hop character on this one is perfectly cohesive. You can almost imagine that the house bacteria are responsible for the citrusy freshness.
-The sourness does not overtake the fruity hops. In fact, you could say both are nearly balanced.
-Brettanomyces feels more outgoing than the rest of the Cantillon funk signature.
-This, with Tilquin, is one of the best new Gueuzes Ive had in a long time. I need to find more.

Bottle.Earlier Rating: 4/20/2005 Total Score: 3.7The Lure:Tart orange rinds and lemons evoke the classic Cantillon sour funkiness. No new territory is discovered, but revisiting a personal favorite is always heartwarming.

The Festivities:Yeast prickles the ample lemon juice for a gum-drying aftershock. Feel is slick and tranquil, thus pointing towards the unblended lambics more than the blended. Easy-drinking for those used to the style, but still the intrinsic Cantillon intensity roams.

Hazy pale golden with a big, frothy, white head that fizzes away rather fast. Lovely funky, citric aroma, floral, roses, a bit of elderflower, bready hints. Highish carbonation, rather spritzy, good solid mouthfeel with nice dryness. Flavour is initially great citric, some orange zest, light dry barnyard notes, some birch leaves and woodruff.

Pours hazy golden with a great, staying creamy, white head. Quite impressive for a gueuze. Aroma is funky, lemons, wood, oranges, vanilla and a slight peppery edge. Medium carbonation, great dry mouthfeel. Lovely tart, some lemons, funk, good dryness, orangse, wood and green apples. Sets itself apart from other gueuzes by being a) milder in tartness, b) lower in apple flavours, higher in citric flavour. This makes it far more drinkable for me than, say, Belle-vue Selection (which is more or less apple vinegar). Very nice, very balanced and incredibly drinkable.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"
349,"2011-11-19",4.3,"75cl bottle. Hazy gold with a big white head. Big lemony, brightly acidic and dusty, musty Brett aroma. Very sour and dry like fizzy water with half a lemon in it. Lots of bright citrus and a little grassy earth in the finish. Dry, light bodied, and highly carbonated. maybe a little more lemony than classic gueuze, but pretty similar. Dont get much from the dry hops, but this bottle has to have some age on it my now. Very nice, very refreshingly sour lambic.

Appears golden orange with a small white head in the tumbler glass Im tasting from. The aromas are an intense flowery and fruity sensation with a wide spectra of sour notes. The normal gueuze fragrances of earth and barnyard are bound to the background and the fresh hops are allowed to dominate the aroma. A lot of citrus, elderflower and apple action going on from the hops. The dryhopping is defiantly noticeable and very pleasant.


As I go into drinking this I can feel how sweet and aromatic it is. Dont get me wrong its sour as well, the balance of it is just superb.

349,"2011-08-02",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 13, 2012 Cantillon Cuvée Saint-Gilloise; Bottle Date 4th October 2010; Sampled August 2011A steady pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces an initially two finger thick head that slowly rises to be an additional almost two-fingers above the rim of my glass; the head has lots of staying power, falls with a varied, rocky surface and even leaves some lacing on the sides of my glass; you really cant ask much more from this beer visually.   The beer is a pale amber color that shows an almost clear, rich, straw-gold hue when held up to the light.  The beer smells of ample lactic acidity (grapefruit and lemon like at times) as well as a solid backing of urea like aromatics.  Behind this is a dried hay and crushed pale grain aromatic; with other aromatic notes this makes me think of a dried field of grass, weeds and wildflowers.  This actually does have quite a bit or herbal / wildflower like aromatic notes to it.  Typical Lambic notes that are musty, slightly musky, sort of dusty, wood shavings, touches of spicy oak, woody pepper that has lost its spice piquancy, .  Woody, herbal and dried grass aromatics seem to dominate the nose after a while, but if you really, really dig, a bright, almost-lemon like note becomes noticeable.

Bracingly tart, with a prickly, effervescent and lively carbonation as this rolls across the palate for the first time.  The beer finishes with some astringent, woody herbal character as well as some tannic oak notes.  An ample lactic acidity provides a nice, clean, biting sourness to this beer that accentuates soft notes of sour-grapefruit and perhaps lemon; though lactic acid never really tastes like this.  The finish has a hint of musky, phenolic, wild / funky yeast character to it.  The body is certainly light and spritzy (from the carbonation), but still manages to have a creamy texture to it at times; this last is likely a combination of the slickness from lactic acid and from the tannic oak structure; the texture of this beer is pretty close to perfect for a Gueuze (or more correctly a carbonated Lambic).  There is a hint of chalkiness to this beer, though it is mostly drowned out by the spicy, herbal hop character.  Some pale grain character contributes a straw like note, some sourdough like bread-character in the middle and some lingering cracker like notes in the finish; the straw / hay flavors are boosted by the hops it seems.

Compared to a Pale Ale or IPA, the dry hopping here is fairly subtle, but there is enough that it substantially influences the character of this beer; interestingly enough the Hallertauer Hops integrated very well with the Lambic flavors, so much so that you could easily miss them, or think the extra complexity came from somewhere else.  The dry hops definitely add an interesting character to the nose, it seems to accentuate the woodiness a bit, bring out more of the straw aromatics from the grain, but also contribute a wildflower like spiciness as well as a sort of herbal character; the hops are not really an aggressive part of the aroma though, and I could see missing them if I didnt know about them, or if one wasnt comparing this to a normal Gueuze.  This is actually really, really good; it blows the Armand4 Oude Geuze Lente I had the other day out of the water (and I really liked that one), the main reason for this is that this beer doesnt have any acetic acid character to it, which the Lente did have.  This beer has reinspired me to explore dry hopping in sour beers; I think it can be done well as long as it is not done too much.Earlier Rating: 9/18/2005 Total Score: 42004 bottling, Sampled September 2005
Pours a hazy straw-orange color with a hint of ruby-grapefruit colored notes.  The carbonation seems quite low, as the cork did not pop at all when pulled, it is carbonated though, but the head is wispy and a frothy pale color.  Ah, the aroma; a suitable funky smell greet my nostrils as I take my first draught of the nose.  The aroma is a mix of citrus, funky notes of mushroom, perhaps some notes of farmhouse cheese, and musty earth.  The Brett character is quite pronounced, and the aroma just keeps the senses piqued for continued sniffing pleasure.

The beer is of course shockingly tart in the first sip, after that is through it becomes pleasingly tart with a bracing note of acidity.  The beer is quite light, and has just enough carbonation to enhance the spritzy refreshing character.  I do think that there is a bit of grassy herbal character here too from the dry hopping in the cask.  This has a nice note of tart grapefruit, and is not nearly as funky in the taste as the nose suggests.  There is a light note of funky cheese in the finish that seems to linger a bit in an astringent manner after the beer has been swallowed.

As this beer warms up it really begins to soften a bit, open up, and become quite a bit more fruity with lots of grapefruit and lemon notes.  This is definitely quite enjoyable, and I definitely do not enjoy Lambics enough, it is definitely a special occasion type beer for me, and I would much prefer that it was an everyday beer for me.

349,"2011-05-10",3.9,"Bottle shared by OSCF - thanks, Todd! Nice earthy golden pour, with a crisp cracklin head. Nose is very inviting, and I really dug the combination of the noble hops and gueuze funk. Nice full body, playful mouthfeel. This general kind of thing seems vaguely consistent with NB Le Terroir, in terms of dry hopped sours. Tart fruits emerge a bit once you get further into the beer, with a finish thats not overwhelmingly acetic but instead balances the funk and the hops. Really well done.Earlier Rating: 2/12/2010 Total Score: 4.1750ml from State Line. I wasnt entirely sure what to expect from a dry-hopped gueuze. Pours a deeper yellow than Id anticipated as well, with a vigorous carbonation thats very appealing. Soft lemon zest and a riot of yeasty elements in the nose, a bit of wood and old armchair. Nice funk and ripe fruits, and I love the way the dry hopping gives the beer a crispness that seems to bring together all the complex flavors really nicely.

Golden color with a white head. Flowery spicy aroma with some funky notes, some must. The flavor is sour but less musty then you normaly would expect due to the quite young age and the powerfull flavors of the hops which include even some pine notes and a dry hoppy finish which definetely comes from the bitterness then from the sourness.

Beer is yellow with a slight haze and thin head of white small bubbles that doesnt leave any lacing on the glass. Carbonation is moderate to low.

Aroma is a little grassy with some mild hop presences and mild acetic notes. There is also some lactic in there and some nice strong funk. Smells like I expected, Cantillon gueuze plus hops. Nice.

Beer is medium to light in body. In the palate, the hops are lost among the carbonic and acetic notes with a strong lactic background and a slightly funky finish.

Appearance: The body is btw straw and golden yellow in color with a slick appearance. Carbonation is minimal, the head is an off white 1 inch crown that shows little retention and leaves little lace.

Smell: Hops, barnyard funk, and a touch of urine soaked hay.

Taste: Same as nose. I had heard that the recipe was different for the new vintages (hops addition) and thats why I tried this bottle fresh. I figured lets try it while the hops are shining. Well the sourness/tartness is minimal when its fresh but it fuses nicely with the hop treatment. Different and well done.

Mouthfeel: On the lite side of medium bodied with minimal carbonation.

Drinkability: Low abv and not very sharp....so easy to drink.

If you are looking for that classic ""Cantillon Sharpness"" that will make you pucker, this isnt the right Cantillon for you. This new recipe is quite sessionable.

Aroma is sweet malt, wild tartness, and funk - your usual Cantillon smell - as well as floral hops, which are a nice touch here.

Flavor is typical Cantillon as well.  Pale malt, their usual awesome wild yeast, and barnyard funk, with light fruits (pineapple/citrus) and floral hops.  This was a fairly fresh bottle (less than one year old), so the hops really came out.

Medium body with pretty mild acidity for a Cantillon beer.  This is not overwhelmingly sour.

Great beer overall.  Id like to see Cantillon make more forays into the hopping arena, although they should use some darker bottles if theyre going to do that, or the beers could become major skunk-o-ramas.  A Cantillon IPA sounds amazing.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

Nose is mildly sweaty, floral and earthy hops, delicate, with some ""juicy"" character, though perhaps not as much as in their standard Gueuze. Flavors are quite earthy, and at colder temperatures, almost too sharp, the dry hopping is extremely apparent, revealing itself as an earthy, though well-integrated aspect as the beer warms. Nice tartness, good earth, and a mild ""sweaty"" character that will doubtless improve as this one ages. A solid effort, though I think I honestly prefer their standard Gueuze.

Cottony, honeysuckle-scented perfume wafts through tart lactic and citric acids, bringing a steady stream of fresh salty warm breezes. Strong and beautiful. Pours a stunning near-crystal-clear peachy shining golden, with a rim in soapy, heavy lacing pure white. Gueze is good. Tart, vibrant, alive and lightly white-grape vinous. Dry, oaked, and crisp. A bit of bearberry and lemon acids come through. The sugar palate isnt as soft and creamy as other versions, but this has a stunning pale nectarine and peach fruit profile. Balanced. The funk level lays a little lower. The carbonation is a bit softer than I expected. Finishing, this beer gives a fireworks glow or ruby, golden, and white grapefruit pulp and zest.

349,"2009-01-09",4.4,"Enjoyed out of flutes. Poured opaque, golden-xanthous with a silken appearance, minimal head. Quite a pungent nose. Sweet citric sourness combined with a sparkling champagne makes a tart aroma which throws your nose through a loop. The favor contains the initial sweet and sourness aspects of the aroma but then softer coniferous hops soothed into reassuring oak. There are hints of champagne, apple, spruce, hay, vinegar, lemon, earth, and candi sugar all the way through. The palate is quite appetizing as well; smooth like fresh juice without the weighty pulp and perfect light carbonation that subtracts nothing from the character and complexity of the flavor. I want to say, having never experienced Cantillon nor a gueuze, this beer is like getting punched in the face then rocked to sleep as you fall to the ground and enjoying every second of it. I have no other way to convey transcendental quality of this beer. Beautiful.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","Jsawyer"

Brewed in 2005, bottled in January 2008.  Poured into a Duvel tulip.  Gorgeous translucent gold with a touch of amber.  One finger of dense, compact, snow-white head that fades into a partial cap and halo.  Thin but solid sheets of lacing.

Aroma consists of lemon juice, crabapple, and grapefruit rind.  Sour but not really funky.

Flavor is similar.  Citric acid, big sourness, vinous/chardonnay notes, and an earthy finish that must be from the dry hopping.

Also present is an intense phenolic character that is more reminiscent of Fantome than traditional Lambic, but it is a welcome addition.  Huge complexity in the nose.  Taste is brightly, intensely sour, nice acidity, bone dry.  This is pretty damn amazing.  I certainly cant think of a Geueze Ive had that is this good.

Flavor of lemon, slight sourness, and slight hop bitterness.  The hops add an interesting dimension to this lambic, but Im not sure they blended well with it.  The palate also seemed weak and unlike other Cantillons Ive had.  Tasted like an American sour ale/lambic-esque beer and didnt quite impress.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LilBeerDoctor"

349,"2008-05-31",4.1,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle, vintage 2006.  Hazy mist of blonde appearance.  Feathery funk and floral herb aroma; lemongrass and zest, mildew and mold, cheese rinds.  Glowing citrus character in the flavor of grapefruit, lemon and lime, juices and rinds; a dried out, pithy bitterness and raging acidic fruit character wholly dominant throughout.  Dry herbal funk lingers calmly underneath all that rindy fruit character with a musty, blue cheese and vinegar stink that seems calm and strangely clean.  Spritzy and full palate; distinctive and commanding; finishes with a pleasingly sweet, tangy funk of goat cheese and lavender that rubs gently and dryly.  Beautiful balance in this seemingly simplified example.  Thanks Ryan!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Light visible carbonation.  The nose is funky and cheesy with some sweaty feet and musty damp cellar.  Theres a really interesting wet leather scent in there too.  A hint of some acidity, some oaky notes, and citrus rinds.  First taste is bracingly tart and acidic with lots of musty cellar and funkiness on the finish.  Its pretty one dimensional at first, all I get is lots of sourness, but everything really blooms on the finish.  Theres some crusty bread maltiness and a tiny bit of powdery sugary sweetness.  Not so sure I really get a whole lot of hoppiness.  Mouthfeel is tight and crisp up front with a little more of a softer nuanced finish.  Perfect slightly fizzy pinpoint carbonation.  A wonderful Gueuze to be sure.  Its really amazing to me that this beer can be so wonderful and still be roughly in the 80th percentile for the style.

I cant remember exactly what kind, but I think it was lemon and herbs or something like that. Antiseptic tone to it. Fair amount of wood is on there too. Flavor is sour indeed. Definite wood character to it. Just a pure mix of tart and wood. This is what a lambic is. Feel is as expected on the liquid and ripe with carbonation. Overall very drinkable.

The taste starts tart with barnyard / earthy traits as well as some fruity richness - lots of complexity with this one.  The finish gets more tart - crisp and refreshing.  Not much sourness to this one, but lots of biting tartness.  Excellent gueze. (8/3/8/4/17 - 4.0)   Rerate notes:   Aroma has, in addition to traits on notes, perfume traits, light chalk, some citrus and a hint of hops.  Body is just about perfect for the style - fairly thin that is very sharp and crisp and carbonation that seems on the sharp side, but spreads flavors like soft carbonation.

349,"2006-09-29",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2009 From the mouth of the brewer the Cuvée des Champions is a beer that is not sold directly by Cantillon.  Its a recipe that they use and re-use when they make an exclusive beer for a restaurant/pub/distributor.  It goes by many names.  I bought mine as a Cuvée du 89 at Beer Circus (supposedly the first batch).  Cloudy yellow-blonde with a medium white head.  I thought I was going to be blown away by this old gueuze but no.  Aroma is a bit more skunky (wet fur) than the standard Cantillon gueuze and taste has a bit more of a juice character.  Overall similar but mellower than the regular gueuze.  An excellent beer but I prefer the aggressiveness of the easier to find regular gueuze.  Cuvée des Second Best.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

So I was at the store, and I needed to spend 40 dollars to be eligible for this prize you win at the end of 16 weeks of spending 40 dollars or more once per week.  This was the last week, so since I was there I picked up a wedge of maytag and it was about 7 bucks.  Since I had good cheese, I decided I would drink a gueuze with it because I have yet to experience that pairing because the places to eat around here that have good cheese only serve shit ass beer like heineken and budweiser.  Beer is brown with a thick white head.  Smell is some hops, oak, lemons, and musty.  Taste is fantastic, smooth, sour, lively, and wood.  Reminds me of Girardin with a little less carbonation.  A really good gueuze, and after having that cheese with this, I am not sure there is any better way to drink a lambic.  This was the perfect pairing.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

349,"2005-09-07",4.3,"HUGE thanks to Dixen for sending this my way! It should be noted to all, that this uses the same label as the Cuvee des Champions. Dixen told me this and Jean-Pierre Van Roy confirmed it via email. Also, both beers use the same base lambic, according to Jean-Pierre. At any rate, lets get on with the show, shall we? Pours a hazed gold with a bubbly champagne like head. Much denser bubble concentration than champagne, however. Nose is outstanding! Funky, citric and bitter. Lots of wood notes to this as well. Horseblanket coming through. I popped this in the fridge only a couple of hours ago so it could chill from its transatlantic flight. Its a bit cooler than room temperature so its really bringing forth a lot of the aroma. Nose also sparks some ideas of lemon drops dancing with mellowed hops. Definitely a lot bigger than the Cuvee des Champions. I could not pick out the Tettnang and Goldings per se. Taste is suitably tart and funky. Lots of lemon, wood, chalk dust, sour fruits, horse blanket, damp earth tones and light hops. Body is light and refreshing. Nice dryness and acidity to this one.  Very crisp at times. Lemon zest poking its head through. Leaves an almost sour melon flavor behind on the tongue.

However, lots of bubbly effervescence streams spiral up from the sides and bottom of the glass. They meet their demise on the surface in the form of slight ripples. Nose is suitably tart. Sour fruit, light barnyard, cat urine, wet leather, and some damp woody notes. Taste is tart but mellow and very drinkable. Fermented peach, wet wood, sour berries, light leather, barnyard, some horse blanket, and damp basement. Body is slightly acidic and dry with lingering tartness.

Instead of yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle theres slime! It didnt taste any different but sure didnt look appetising. Aroma is initially quite hoppy like Iris, but after a while its only part of the blend. Toast, vanilla ice cream, mild musty Cantillon funk, carpentry, apple cores and fungus. Surprisingly mild flavour (for Cantillon, that is). Very light body, barely any sweetness, leafy hop character, lots of wood, soda water, then a roughish bitterness and light, clean sourness. Slight peachy fruit. Tobacco aftertaste. Not particularly sour for Cantillon, with no acetic character whatsoever. Bears more than a passing resemblance to Orval for mine.

Bottle at Le Bier Circus, Brussels - Cuvee 89  Fizzy, white head, which diminishes as most of the lambics do.  Hazy, orange body.  Nose of lime, grapefruit, pine.  Lightly acidic, moderately bitter initial flavour, with presence of hops.  Moderately acidic, lightly bitter finish (averagily long).  Light to medium bodied.  Fizzy carbonation.  Nice beer.  The dry-hopping is markable.  I drunk thisone at one of the last days of Le Bier Circus at N°89.  Anyway somewhat different for a Cantillon-batch.Earlier Rating: 9/28/2004 Total Score: 4.4Bottled  I did not get hold of the Cantillon Cuvée 1904, luckfully I did get hold of its successor, the Cantillon Cuvée des Champions. It has an off-white, fizzy head, which is fully diminsihing.  The body is clear and orange-amber.  From the moment I opened this bottle, I smelled the very warm aroma, which is citric, hoppy and reminds me of a very good wine.  The initial flavour is moderately acidic, lightly bitter.  The finish is moderately sour and lasts for minutes.  I do agree with BierKönig that this one is a very extra-ordinay lambic.  This isnt an aggressive beer (as I would describe a normal Cantillon Gueuze), but because it is so well-balanced its truely a pleasure to drink.Actually this beer was made in honour of the promotion of a soccer team (Royal Union Sint Gilloise) into the second soccer division in Belgium.  I hope some day RUSG wins the UEFA""s Champions League and that Jean will make a lambic that is as superb for the CLs victoy as this beer is superb for the promotion.

I would reccomend that. The brew is a deep gold with some lacy foam . The aroma is definately lambic I got horse blanket and hay and some shortbread 
cookie it smells awesome! The dry hops I was expecting did not come through at all.The taste is tart , acidic and lots of vinegar.I think its a aquired taste and I havent aquired it.Still no hops notes.

Tastes of green apples and light lemons. Nice lighter sour and tart finish. Very good.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"

349,"2005-04-22",4.1,"750 ml bottle lasciviously liquidated with beerbuzzmontreal, ClarkVV, MartinT, tiggmtl, olivier, Rastacouere and Simon at the Farmhouse Ales and More! tasting in Montreal.  Pale, almost clear apricot body, with little head atop the light haze...very sharp, sour, typical Cantillon nose that would wake the dead...barnyardy animal motes interact with creosote and an old wood lot....oak is evident in the sour body, which is much easier to drink (and somewhat less distinctive) than most Cantillons, a bit of brown sugar is evident in the middle with a touch of apple...strong tartness returns for the finish with a bit of pepper, all tucked in a full, lightly syrupy body.  Not the best from Cantillon, but worthy and interesting as always.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
349,"2005-04-20",3.8,"04.20.05  750ml bottle, cork dated 2-2004.  Hazed orange-gold with little head.  Stinky aromas of leather, citrus, sour, strawberry, wood.  I really want to like gueuze, but it with trepidation that I take a first sip as I know this glass may be a struggle.  A breakthrough, I think, as I find a nice floral flavor, fruity, and a tasty hop profile that gives me something  friendly to focus on when the sourness gets to be just a hint too much.  Lots of citrus and plenty of barnyard.  The cheese shop funk is not beating me up this time; in fact, the mild leather, sweat, and dust are more complimentary than dominant.  The astringent finish clears up a somewhat unctuous feeling right before the swallow.  If more lambic were low key like this one, Id drink more lambics.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
349,"2005-04-19",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2006 Pours a hazy orange color with a ring of white lace. Very sour and tart aroma of strawberry jam and acidity. Very good flavor of cheese, strawberry jam and barnyard covered by dust and cobwebs with a good acidity  and a sweet finish. Light body, dusty texture and very soft carbonation.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
349,"2005-04-18",3.9,"Opaque gold, very murky, a nice sight color wise, but unfortunately a quickly departing head. Aroma feels surprisingly sweet, as always well presented on a sweaty and leathery dominated wild yeast top ground. More floral than most, thanks to those untamed hops. It develops a pleasant horsey saltiness as it gains temperature. Its hard to explain how those hops blend in with the rest, but it creates a cheesier character than the yeast alone would I feel. Abundant grapefruit taste. Strong big bubbles, surprising considering the small shape of the head, pretty full bodied as well, I like that. Oldish taste despite the fresh aroma. Sweet and easy drinking proposing a lemon slice here and there that grows into a pungent tartness reminiscent of a straight lambic. I kinda dig the balance, but it doesnt stand out as one of my favourites, I just like its originality. A dessert lambic? Why not!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
349,"2005-04-12",3.7,"Earthy, sour, wet grass aroma. Pale gold. Citric , sour and full of flavour lambic . Nice touch of black tea like afterflavour . After one glass you will want more of it.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"
349,"2005-04-09",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 26, 2005 A mild quiver overtakes my body (and  if you have seen my body, you know it is a moderate seismic event) as the cork is lifted and the Cantillon aroma reaches the nose.  Lightly hazed golden liquid. Smaller off white head that is rather lasting for the fizziness that is displayed. Classic Cantillon aroma, with light malt, mild hops, mild lemon zest and just a hint of attic dust. Light and lively on the palate. Sweet malt flavors overtake the tongue for a fleeting moment and than the liquid slides back and mild lemons and white grapes mix. Hops are there, but only enough to add some mild floral tones. A quick quaff. This seems, like many lambic, not to have a long and lasting party on the palate, but to strike fast and furious leaving the assailant wondering what happened. Oh, Ill just shut up and enjoy!","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
349,"2005-04-07",4.4,"Thanks to Steve (Hopdog) for this. Nice light orange color with a nice head that settles into looking just plain flat. Subdued Cantillon aroma of barn. Taste is pucking tart for the novice but mellow by their regular stuff. Flavors of sour apple, funky cheese, hay, earthy grass and leather, all the good stuff. So light  refreshing. Another masterpiece.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"

349,"2005-04-01",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2005 Ahhh, cuvée des champignons at long last!  ;)The boring (but ever so important) details:  Consumed 3/31/05 at room temperature in a Lindemans Lambic flute.I should just say ""Five"" for appearance and not waste any more time.  What more could you ask?  Beautiful, immediately noticeable, burnished copper shine to a body that runs the spectrum from orange to yellow.  Hazy, without being muddy.  Rapidly moving, miniscule bubbles rise incessantly.  Large amount of white (with a slight yellow sheen to it) head is lasting and leaves the glass permanently laced (meaning until I wash it out; thats some low filtration!).The nose comes alive from the minute the cork is pulled, with playful yellow fruits (pears, nectarines, apricots), soft and restrained, aged hops, vibrantly funky yeast and light pepper atop green apples.  Light woody/oak nuances are distinctive, but never overdone.  Im not smelling any eggy farts, though of course there is sulphur. . . .Hardly being able to wait, I drink greedily and my mouth is alive with a very much lively, engaging, chatterbox of a lambic.  Soft fruit flavors, plenty of farmhouse character.  Lipsmacking brett adds the tartness, with plenty of lactobacillius to balance, adding a sour, cheesy note to the flavor.  Ripe cheese, musty wood, moderate acidity (by Cantillon standards), with light orange zest, some white pepper, tea leaves/herbalness and a very dry/sour finish.Body and mouthfeel are so stunningly executed, you dont really even think about them, you just drink and enjoy the flavors and feel refreshed at having done so.  Soft, easygoing, natural carbonation adds just the right amount of texture, while a rich, but yet not-too-full body provides a perfect serving vessel for these plentiful flavors.As I drink more and finish the bottle, all too quickly, I have a long-lingering flavor of rustic cheese mixed with light green apple tartness, on my palate.  Quite delightful.  This stuff has aged so well and with such care.  There is a bit of a lapse of flavor, upon first sip, as Schropfy notes, but the palate quickly gets used to it, and the beer is rendered that much more refreshing.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

God bless Engelsman for sharing this one.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Kinnaj15"
349,"2005-03-23",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2005 Bottle: Light-medium amber/orange color with a medium white head. The body looks somewhat opaque to me, and remains hazy even when held directly up to the light.  This has quite a bit of carbonation for an unblended lambic (due to the addition of candi sugar as mentioned).  When too cold (about 45F) the aroma is more fruity than sour.  At this point notes of lemon, peach, grapefruit, apple and orange really show - the sourness is there, but seems more in the background at first.  As it warms to room temperature, the aroma becomes more citric, acidic, and sour.  Unripened orange rind, sour orange, lemon, mild leather, light barnyard, and dust come out in a very musty scent.  I even get some spicy pepper, fresh-cut grass, blue cheese, band-aid, marigolds at the tail end, and as Schroppfy has noted, apricots towards the end of the bottle.  Interestingly, the hops really seem to come through in the aroma if you give it a vigorous pour, allowing a large head to form.  Medium bodied, with spritzy carbonation and an almost creamy mouth feel.  The first sip really overwhelms my palate with lemon rind.  Though to be honest, its not as sour as I expected.  After my palate gets beyond the initial shock, multiple flavors start to reveal themselves: sour grapefruit, orange rind, dandelions, leather, a hint of barnyard, fresh bitter grass, lemon grass, wet leaves, salt & pepper, xerox paper, sweet ruby grapefruit, celestial seasonings red zinger tea, rhubarb, cheese, and light wood.  When the bottle nears the end it seems to get markedly sweeter.  Im not sure what accounts for this.   Finishes quite bitter and acidic with notes of citrus and something else I just couldnt place until I saw that rauchbier had it nailed - retronasel hops notes.  Even further out in the finish some notes of sour grapes, cardboard and chardonnay come through.  I was lucky to get my hands on this one.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"
349,"2005-03-10",4.1,"Fantastic aroma. Still (one can immediately tell this is unblended) with little head unless you try hard. Glowing orange/amber. Great barnyard, leather, musty aroma - by the end with the dregs pour there is a real apricot fruitiness. The flavor has an initial hole, not watery by any stretch, but empty, then a bursting bitter finish. Did not detect dry-hopping. Definitely the body of a lou pepe gueuze (a fact observed not by me but by the esteemed JSturm, and in fact he pegged the priming addition of the sugar as in the lou pepe). Delectable and thanks to the VA connection!!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
349,"2005-03-06",4.3,"A perfect cloudy orange/fresh ripe peach skin colored body. The medium-particled white head is  medium in size and diminshes down to a ring that lasts for the duration. The aroma is more citric than the typical Cantillon, also the usual supsects of dust, musty basement, cobwebs, and even some lemon rind come out. The flavor is intense up front (big surprise right). Lemon, grapefruit, acidic, tart, and lots of hops. The palate is attenutated with a lively mouthfeel. A lovely brew very refreshing.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

349,"2004-09-27",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2005 I asked Sten, the owner of Akkurat in Stockholm, if they got this beer, knowing that it was only released a couple of weeks earlier in Belgium. They just got it in the day before so I was very lucky to get the first bottle! Thanks Sten :-) The beer pours a thin snow white head on a cloudy dark yellow body. The aroma is rather mild but with a nice complexity of hops shining through the grapefruity sourness. The flavor starts with a very nice and fresh hoppy bitterness (East Kent Goldings) and ends in a long lasting citrusy finish with an excellent balanced sourness. It is not as tart as many of the other Cantillons I have had but more fruity with notes of grapefruit and oranges. This beer is really amazing, the mouthfull is nice and foamy and it all ends in a very fine dry finish. This is one of the most balanced and complex lambics I have had to date and I must say that dry hopping really suits lambics. A bulls-eye from Cantillon!!","Brooklyn, Alabama, USA","Jeppe"
