1776,"2015-07-14",3.1,"This was poured into a pilsener glass. 
The appearance was a nice looking hazy golden orange color with a two finger white foamy head that dissipated within about thirty seconds leaving messy clingy lacing sticking to the glass.
The smell started off with crisp sweet nutty malts leading into a slight sweet biscuity edge.
The taste was mainly sweet through the combination of the nutty malts and biscuity aspect and also allowing a slight roastiness coming into balance. Theres a nutty aftertaste and a quick sweet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation feels right and leads to a nice smoothness about it.
Overall, this was a pretty good Vienna Lager that I could have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Pours a crystal clear golden colored body with a finger-width, dense and frothy, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a solid lacing throughout.

1776,"2011-06-13",3.1,"My Bottom Line:
This Viennas dull bready malts and faint herbal, spicy hops evolve in a highly drinkable mouthfeel. Good, but it would undoubtedly be better fresh at the brewery.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the hazy light amber.
-A light yeasty touch mars the delicate malt profile.
-Even though I could pound this while never complaining, I would say there is still work to be done to make this as memorable as 7 Sterns,  Kadlez Bräus or Wieden Bräus session lagers, to name only those Viennese breweries.
-This brew was not as engaging as their Dunkles Lager had the same evening. Lots of drinkability, but the hops felt tired and the malt flavors werent as compelling.

How: Tap at the brewpub
The look: Clear golden-blonde body topped by a very small white head
In long: Timid nose has light fruity esters.  Taste is a mix of dried fruits and fresh fruits (citrus fruits, bananas, pears).  Only a tiny little bit of caramel.  Discreet leafy hops.  Lively body.  Intensity level is very low.  This is the type of all-too-clean and polished lager I would expect from a mass produced can coming from a large scale respectable European lager brewery.
