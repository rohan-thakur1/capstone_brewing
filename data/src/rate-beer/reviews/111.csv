Caramel apple sweetness with a nice balance of acidity.  Upon some sips, I got a hit of cheese in there. Full mouthfeel with a much more acidic and dry finish.  The aroma didnt necessarily bode well for this one, but Im glad the flavor really came out.  Really delicious stuff and would certainly try again some time.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"

More pear like, more tropical fruits than LA Face, with a lighter feel and some pleasant spices. Finish has a lighter oxidized note. Just realized this is Avalanche and not the normal Los saragnant cider, which explains the pear flavors.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

111,"2012-10-17",4.1,"La version vendue à la SAQ.  Une belle robe dorée bien limpide.  De belles jambes qui saccrochent à la paroi du verre.  Un nez chargé par les pommes et par dautres fruits du verger.  Des notes de petits fruits rouges.  Du miel sauvage et des notes de sirop dérable.  Au goût, des notes collantes de pommes qui sont traversées par une chaleur et par une certaine acidité.  En bouche, une agréable sensation.  Un corps rond qui se laisse facilement apprivoiser.  En finale, une ode sucrée fortement complexe avec un mouvement acidulé et un moment réconfortant.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

111,"2012-01-07",4.0,"2008 vintage. 200ml bottle shared between 2 personas... Pours a predominantly copper mildly amber hue with absolutely no head whatosoever which is to be expected with a nice glazed over film of legs running down the sides of the glass... Sweet sacharine honey and liquor soaked rum apples. Very dessert like in essence with almost a thick honey like texture. Solid but the sweetness was a touch overbearing... Flavors are sweet and syrupy with concentrated caramelized  granny smith apples. Sweet up front through the middle and continues on through the finish. Medium to full consistency with a pretty full bodied experience. Not much more to say except that its  a solid ice cider thats well deserving of a try.  Wish there were more of it to go around for this tasty little treat.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

111,"2011-05-14",3.9,"200 ml bottle, dipped with red wax and corked. Pours a clear yellow almost reddish with some bubbles and a bit of legs on the glass. A sweet sugary nose of apricot and massive apples, very ripe. The flavor exhibits some sourness, some heat, mostly sticky sweet overripe apples, but the sweetness does border on apricot as well. Very nice and different.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
