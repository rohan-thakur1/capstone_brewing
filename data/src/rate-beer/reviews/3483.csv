Wow. Tastes amazing. Sweetness is perfect upon this pillow of stoutness. Finish only gets bitter at the very end. Its basically as if great coffee was also a beer.

3483,"2014-08-02",4.1,"On draft at the Beer Baron. It pours a pitch black color with a gorgeous brown head. The aroma is roasted with dark chocolate, coffee and some lactose sweetness that sets it apart from regular Speedway. The flavor is sweet and roasted up front with dark chocolate, coffee and some more mild milk sugars before a surprisingly dry, roasted finish. This is a big boy for sure, but surprisingly easy to drink. Very nice. Maybe a touch sweeter up front compared to the regular version, but the finish is still spectacular.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

3483,"2013-08-30",4.5,"Draft at Alesmith Tasting room with Linh months and months back. Pours a deep black body with huge foamy mocha head.

3483,"2012-10-17",3.8,"Growler.  Aged precisely an equivalent amount of time to a rabbits gestation period.  This was done by the request of thome50.  He said this was when the beer was at its peak.  Pour is deep brown with a massive khaki head.  Great lacing left on the glass after the head dies down.  Sweet chocolate and coconut aroma.  Only time Ive ever had Vietnamese coffee was cold press, but this is very reminiscent.  Sweeter and more desert-like.  Taste has much more roast coffee character coming out, but it is a bit charred tasting to me.  Lots of sweetness with milk chocolate and coconut still being present.  Finish has some cherries.  Just like regular speedway this is full bodied, but not too heavy and rich.  Nice and silky on the tongue.  Pretty damn good, but the sweeter character is really not something I like.  Too much like desert coffee for me.","Minnesota, USA","mattyb83"
3483,"2012-10-10",4.2,"Served on tap at the AleSmith tasting room. The appearance is a typical deep black Speedway hue. Very thick body. The nose has that great creamy Vietnamese coffee to it with a full roast maltyness, chocolate, and some small barrel additions. The flavor follows suit. Very tasty coffee. A lot more creamy/lactose then the regular version. Dark chocolate and muted bourbon add to this tasty treat. Full creamy mouth with a bit of oaky drying.

3483,"2012-09-17",4.4,"Very good, kind of boozy, but still very good.  Its smooth and very sweet, has a lot of chocolate, vanilla, hazelnut.  Can taste the coffee and a little bourbon as well.

3483,"2012-07-20",4.7,"On tap on the RBSG bus. Good way to start the day... Pours black with root beer edges and a fluffy light-brown head. Smells like brownies and chocolate chip cookies. Deep cookie dough, really vivid and very different from the garden variety Speedway. Flavor has elements of chocolate syrup and semisweet chocolate, along with a lovely toasted oaky note that dries out the finish. The coffee is strong and lends a solid bitterness. Really a fantastic beer, a hit in every aspect.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

Caramel and butterscotch balance bitter chocolate and lemon.
