2377,"2017-06-15",3.5,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a hazed very brown amber with a medium sized white head. Toast, citrus but musky and faint, toast. Medium bodied, toast, a bit of bitterness, citrus, toast. Citrus on the finish, faintly bitter with lingering grapefruit zestu. Weird because theres not a ton going on here in any direction, comes across as a somewhat conflicted beer, pulling in about four or five directions. Wants to be hoppy, but isnt, wants to be malty, citrusy, bitter, but isnt. Decent, but ultimately forgettable as it never makes its mark in any way. Dont get me wrong, its still tasty and drinkable, and you can likely drink a bunch of them and be happy since it will satisfy something different each time, but Im having a hard time pinning it down for one thing that stands out in any notable measure that makes me want to seek it out specifically again. Ultimately thats ok, its still tasty enough.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

2377,"2016-11-30",3.3,"On tap @ Bissell Brothers. Super, super cloudy amber color with off-white foam. Was nowhere near as big a fan of this as the other drafts I tried during my visit. Does at least have some tropical and citrusy hops, but its heavy on the toast and caramel malts. Has some pepper, wood, and grassy hops notes and bitterness. Eh.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

2377,"2016-11-19",3.4,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2016 Can poured into a snifter showing really dark sewer looking brown with two fingers of tanned brown foam. This looks interesting. 

The nose shows subtle notes of pine resin. Upon warming up strong notes of cannabis become very apparent.

The palate is medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Feels somewhat sediment-y. Flavors of bready malts and not much else. Light bitterness on the finish with a resurgence of the bready malts.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

2377,"2016-08-26",3.9,"On tap at the brewery. Milky Amber pour with a white head. I typically dont like amber ales, but this is an exception. Muted bitter orange, grapefruit, and citrus hop notes yield to caramel malt backbeats. Good body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"

2377,"2016-07-21",4.1,"Draught at the Thirsty Pig, 7/10/16.Just a hilariously ugly, muddy, drab, mauve-dark amber. Beige head atop is large and well-retained. The first New England-style amber IPA Ive seen.Juiciness is there in force, with cherry, melon, lime and kiwi confronted by a pleasing graininess from the specialty malts. Fresh yeast adding lots of minerality and light earth with a hint of ash on the end. But the juicy, fruity, succulent hops persist and are joined by light honey-vanilla-caramel suggestions, softening the graininess somewhat. No alcohol or flaw.Very soft texture with ample, tight carbonation and plentiful citrus notes mixing with melon, cherry and sweet lime. Graininess almost becomes problematic/scratchy but not quite and it actually dries out and balances the base malt and hugely juicy, fruity hops nicely. More citrus lingering on the end with moderate to moderately-high (but still tolerable) bitterness and no alcohol or flaw.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2377,"2016-07-02",3.7,"Murky red brown. Aroma is citrusy hops. Fruity and slight toffee malt. Good stuff tough to do an amber of this style and not have it be word, like it","Saskatchewan, CANADA","dresden"
2377,"2016-06-26",3.5,"On tap at the brewerys new location. Slightly hazy medium amber pour with frothy head. Interesting cracker and malt sensations with some floral and pine notes. Medium body.

2377,"2016-06-16",3.8,"Sample at Bissell Brothers with koleminer20. Aroma is malt, bread, tropical fruit, pine, very hoppy. Appearance is ugly, amber brown copper, light tan head, hazy. Taste is juicy, tropical fruit, bitter malt, caramel, bready, good. Mouthfeel is light to medium body, light crisp carbonation, bready fruit aftertaste. Overall, solid solid amber.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
2377,"2016-06-16",3.8,"On tap at Bissell Brothers. The pour is a messy light orange-tinted Amber brown color with a big bubbly ivory head that falls to a collar leaving a ton of lace. The aroma is just what youd expect in an Amber. There is a light sweet maltiness and a little leafy hop present on the back end. Thats about it here. Basic and light, but thats what an Amber is. The flavor is really juicy hop right up front that makes this drink like the ugliest IPA youve ever seen. The malts come in about half way through and a lighter caramel sweetness carries it out to the finish. The mouth feel is a little thicker and well carbonated with a juicy citrus tinted caramel malt lingering on the aftertaste. This is ugly as hell to look at, but it does well.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
2377,"2016-03-04",3.6,"On draft directly from one of the Bissell Brothers (or at least someone who works there). Hop-forward and pungent, like all BB beers, but this one is probably one of their most subdued offerings. Maltier, darker, and less hoppy than their pale ales and IPAs. It smelled incredible, but the taste was a little to low-key for what I was looking for from Bissell.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

2377,"2015-06-22",3.8,"16 oz. can purchased at Tullys in Wells, ME. Serious deep red color/ honestly damn near brown. Aroma very deep earthy hops sitting on top caramel. 
The flavor is has the expected toasted grain and caramel malt with a high hop profile. The hops are earthy and herbal with maybe a hint of pine. The texture is gritty and dry. Anybody who knows me understand I feel like Amber ales are very ordinary and plain. Bissell Bros. manages to make a highly drinkable Amber with this hop profile. This is about top tier in the style for my palate.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
