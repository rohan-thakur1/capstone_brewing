1079,"2016-10-12",3.3,"Thought the name was amusing so bought a can at the LCBO in Hamilton. Light cloudy gold with a lime green tint and a musty pear aroma. Light bodied and very dry. The taste is pear, tart a bit earthy and dry with a residual sweetness. Not bad though most ladies who tried it were looking for something sweeter.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"

1079,"2016-07-01",2.9,"473ml can. Pours no head whatsoever and has a pale yellowish appearance. No lacing. Aromas are a bit fruity, hints of pears, a bit dank. Flavours are very sweet, citric juices, sugary and syrupy. Pear flavour mainly in the finish. Has a tangy mouthfeel. It might be a bit much to have any more than the one tallboy. Too sweet.","Winchester, Ontario, CANADA","AleRider78"
