Aroma¬ís really potent... so much going on... wheaty, yellow berries, salty and sour, concentrated apple juice made of really sour apples, and the coriander giving it a herbal-medicinal note. Tastes wheaty and heavy sour, not exactly appley but the sourness is reminiscent of really sour unripe late summer apples, or more precisely maybe, fresh sauerkraut (Estonians, and I guess Germans, will understand). Dryish grains in the finish, also sticky sourness. Would love a bit more salt... Both salt and coriander are pretty modest in flavour.

It certainly starts out very stark and I even thought there was a bit of metal, but as it breathes, this passes and it turns out to be just a ton of salt and lactic notes. No alcohol or flaw.In the mouth, it¬ís heavily acidic up front, causing a bit of recoil, before a creamy effervescence washes over the palate, providing light honey and vanilla notes, light vegetal character from the herbs and interesting yeast character lingering. Definitely not just a straightforward, cookie cutter rendition and while the nose is a bit tough to warm up to, the near perfect amount of malt balance that follows the extreme tartness up front is really enjoyable, especially given the creamy texture.

3564,"2015-06-28",3.6,"So many beers, so little time and so many I can¬ít get to without a struggle. But I got this one!
I pour the beer into a stange, the honey-lemon liquid is capped fleetingly with a bright white foam. The head is gone by the time I put my camera away, and I find myself with a headless brew. The aroma is funky, tart-lemon, and it tickles my sinuses as I breathe it in. It¬ís really earthy and a bit salty; and I can almost taste the ocean when I tip the glass to drink.
I take small sips at first, then large swallows, flooding my mouth with the beer, gaging the feel of it. It¬ís so lively that at first I don¬ít even notice the sour, but then the brew warms on my tongue and loses that initial buzz. Now the taste comes on to me, punching its way from my lips to my throat, graceful but angry. This has a beautifully light body, and to have that kind of carbonation and taste combination, it must.
The flavors are carried over from the aroma, the saltiness of the nose creating an excellently supportive dryness on my tongue and gums; allowing the earthy, lemony sourness to play over my taste buds. It is a bit of a finish, lengthy and of course, the Gose being what it is, I should expect that. There are just some tastes that hang on longer than others. This is surprisingly mellow for a sour beer, and being certain that it is at the recommended temperature is key. I let it warm a bit just to see how it goes and I am not happy with it at all. Keep it cold. It¬ís quite delicious if you keep it cold!","USA","lightbias"

3564,"2015-05-14",3.8,"BOD 4/9/15. Pours a hazy light amber (golden). Normal head volume, poor lacing and retention.

Slightly subdued nose of lime/lemon, coriander hints and a slight sourness over a mild saline background. 

Light medium body with a smooth texture plus a nice chewy graininess from the wheat. Slightly below normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice rolling prickly effervescence going into the finish. 

The outstanding flavor profile is intense, rather complex and well balanced. It begins with a lime flavored tartness that takes on a subtle sourness. These flavors are always present, but fade slightly in the middle allowing a bit of coriander to be noted over a wheat and biscuit background. Where the middle ends, the salinity begins. Underneath the lime is a mild sea water aspect that becomes most evident in the finish bringing a masterful balance to the tart and sour predominance. The finish is a slow fade of these flavors.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

Harsher onset in taste, very much like half-fat buttermilk mixed with lemon juice. Wheat malt fruitiness and some pleasing almond in the back. Gose is not a complex style, but does live from its aeriness and quenching qualities. I found this one a tad too lemony and ""packed"", driven by a recognisable US-craft horror vacui approach towards ""more is more/practise clearly what you advertise"", leading to tastes less delicate and only hinted at in the best examples of the style (Ritterguts).","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

3564,"2015-04-18",3.5,"The Gose style was once very popular in a certain region of Germany, Goethe drank gallons of it, then became extinct, and is now being revived by the craft beer world, sparking curiosity. This one has a misty, deep egg yolk yellow blonde colour with nuances of green and orange covered in clouds of yeast, yet very transparent (almost colourless) around the edges; egg-white, very thin and unstable head, decreasing immediately and all but disappearing after a short while. Aroma of wheat, lots of lactic acidity (unsweetened yoghurt, sour cream, goat cheese), something faintly salty (seaweed), the expected coriander, stale sweat, sourdough, sorrel leaves, strong suggestion of Sauerkraut (sour, fermented cabbage and meat), something vaguely egg-like and apple peel. Interesting taste: kicks off with a sharp, refreshing lemon acidity, turning into a more subdued but dominant lactic acidity (sour milk), still medium carbonation in spite of the lack of head or fizz; a basic wheat sourishness underlies along with a hint of bready barley malts; drying coriander effect is there, but less ¬íobnoxious¬í than in many Belgian witbier examples; smooth, mellow and supple mouthfeel, salt presence is restrained and mainly structural, as it should be, though it can be noticed on the sides of the tongue. Finishes in a slightly drying coriander taste along with equally drying sourness, but nothing too corrosive: it is a gentle, soft, ¬ílong¬í and ¬ídeep¬í tartness as in a Berliner Weisse. Much like Sauerkraut, to which this would be an ideal companion, this is clearly an acquired taste, and there still aren¬ít many congeners to compare it with; the Sauerkraut aroma is admittedly typical for the style, but I still have to get used to it.  I do like the actual taste of it, though: totally quenching, refreshing, crisp and very interesting, too bad for the lack of head, though.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
3564,"2015-04-15",3.4,"Cans via sloth - thanks again! Nose obviously tart with faint orange soda/peel character and lactic presence, coriander freshness is also there but quite faint in the aromatic department. Pour enduringly noisy/fizzy, cloudy golden with a bright white head. Taste somewhat sharp and slightly metallic, lightly tart and not at all sour (sort of a letdown there!), body is very full and crisp. Faint bitterness, relatively dry, and the tartness does tend to accumulate with volume, which is good, but we¬íre still nowhere near a pucker. Coriander and citric elements are largely absent - this is a heavy, full American Wheat, though brewed for a more modern palate than those targeted by brewpubs fifteen and twenty years ago. Touch slimy with wheat, but strips the palate efficiently. Overall fresh, clean, and lively, without obvious alcohol; there¬ís some tension for me here, as this is not as bold or memorable as the more traditional Gose I treasure (the lacto is not complex at all and really needs to jump), but I¬íd probably drink more of this in a sitting (three or four with no problem, should have enough total acidity by then).

Harsh salty sour aroma. Also smells of body parts that I can¬ít name. Mosty as I haven¬ít identified which cleft, bifurcation or fold it is associated with. Anna thinks it might be belly-button. Quote from the Aussie dude ""shit that tastes gross"", after only sniffing it. As it warms, the wheatiness comes over more. In the mouth it is really sharp and sour, with crisp carbonation. Wheaty, milky, salty, and harshly acidic. This would be a damn good hangover beer. Finish has plenty of wheat, that comes over quite nicely, and is the best thing about the brew. Clearly a victim of forced innoculation, and not traditional techniques - this level of acidity would be considered toxic in central europe. A fun challenge to finish the can, I think I¬ím gonna make it. Oops, a tooth just dropped out, and my lower lip is hanging off.

Thanks to buffalohead for the generous gift of several Westbrook beers. This true to style release deserves all the accolades showered on it. If a brewery closer to home sold something like it on a regular basis I might buy more for sharing as a gateway beer. Much like King Gose Home from Hoppin¬í Frog it demonstrates that ¬íbig¬í is not always better.

Aroma / Appearance - A cloudy rich orange base shimmers in the glass like a flat mimosa with short lived crisp head. Sea salt spread over fresh homemade wheat fills the air with a light beach texture. Clean and to the point, it does not attempt to be anything more than a nice introduction.

Flavor / Palate - Salty peaches and sardines (minus the fish) tickle the tongue. Ground sea salt emerges a few seconds later. The transition opens up a fruitiness that pairs well with the salty sourness. A welcome gose should be on the wantlist of anyone who wants to know why the style is getting so much attention these last few years.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3564,"2014-07-22",3.9,"I poured a 12oz can into a goblet. It was canned on 6/16/14 and cost $3.20 ($0.27 per ounce).

Appearance: Gold hue over a hazy body. Plenty of initial carbonation, but settles down quickly. Pours to a small, white, soapy head which completely dissipates and leaves no lacing.

Smell: Slightly mild nose with distinct sour candy scent and a hint of lemon.

Taste: Everyone loves sours, but up until recently it was only the really expensive, rare, high alcohol sour beers that were en vogue. Now sessionable sours like Berlinner Weise and Gose are all the rage. That¬ís okay, because they¬íre easier to come by and actually quite affordable; Westbrook Gose being a good example of what I mean. This might be best described as alcoholic lemonade (authentic, homemade, hand-squeezed lemonade ¬ñ not that mass-produced stuff that¬ís just a chemical cocktail). The palette is simplistic and repetitive in that there¬ís pretty much only two flavor characters here: a tartness with a slight lemony taste and a sourness like candy. Nothing in the way of genuine malt or hop character, though those traits aren¬ít meant to stand out anyway. The salt presence accentuates the tartness ¬ñ there¬ís no astringency like that of sea water. 

Drinkability: It¬ís nice to see low ABV beers that are truly refreshing like Westbrook Gose come in cans, as this is the kind of beer you can enjoy straight from the container without missing out on much of the experience. This is a very easy beer to drink as the mouthfeel is thin and crisp, but never becomes flat. The tartness and sourness are not challenging to get past (especially when enjoyed cold). At only 4% ABV this is an ideal session beer for summer.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Appearance - This brew is opaque, golden-brown, w/ little head-retention (not that I expected much any way). 

Taste - traditional taste of a Gose -- salty, subtle hints of coriander and clove, and relatively sour. Moderately carbonated, too. 

Palate - Refreshingly sour, dry finish, moderately carbonated, and bready. 

Overall, it is no surprise that this Gose is great value. It is not my favorite Gose, but for the price, it is pretty tough to beat.

I really have no idea what to expect going in to this, with no point of reference for how this style is supposed to taste. Pours a very murky pale yellow. The fizzy white head is gone after about 20 seconds. After it settles, it looks like unfiltered apple juice sitting in the glass. Aroma is lemon, citrus zest, sweat (not necessarily in a bad way), and has a bit of a grassy smell in there too. Very interesting. Flavor is very surprising. The beer is very tart on the front end, before fading off into a mild salty sweetness that is very pleasant. The tartness still lingers like taking a bite of a tart cherry or something. Flavor is much bigger than I expected. Surprisingly delicious beer.","Georgia, USA","dunn4040"

3564,"2014-01-25",4.2,"Reviewed from notes. Rcvd in trade. Stamped on the bottom of the can, 9/19/13.
She pours a hazy golden yellow color and leaves the same colored body with a one a half finger white foamy head that dies within about a minute, some light ringy lacing clings just a little bit.
The smell has some lemon, light wheat, and coriander combined and coming through in a sour and somewhat tart sort of way.
The taste was mainly sour and tart lemon, backed up nicely by the wheat and coriander, however, the salt adds some nice flavoring that complements nicely. She has a sour lemon aftertaste with no finish.
On the palate, she sits light and comes across fairly sessionable. Carbonation seems to be fairly harsh, but nothing that seems to be bad (I think this is supposed to be this way, but have had only two Goses before this).
Overall, I would say this is good for the style but I haven¬ít had too many of these and I realize I need to try ones from Germany just to gauge this.

3564,"2013-12-12",4.1,"Canned September 19, 2013 (3 months old).
Appearance: The body is hazy with milky velvety texture. The hue is a pale orange with straw colored edges. The head is tall, dense and fluffy with excellent retention.
Aroma: The aroma is a mix of tart and sweet, with a good strength. On the tart end is a mild lemonade and grapefruit aroma, on the sweet end a sort of cotton candy presence with a sort of melon rind aroma. I really enjoy how fruity the aroma is with subtle nuances. 
Taste: This is a like a mildly sweetened lemonade, lots of tart up front but mildly sweet on the finish. I get some orange and grapefruit throughout, complimenting the lemonade nicely. The finish is dry and minerally.
Palate: Full bodied, but crisp and refreshing. More body than many stouts I¬íve had.
Overall: What an enjoyable beer, this is the ultimate Summer beer and I regret trying it as I can not get this regularly. You know, the old ""You don¬ít know what you¬íre missing until you¬íve had it,"" saying. I guess I know what I¬íll be brewing come Spring.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

The foam fizzed briefly to for a thin floating head before fading away, and leaving behind a still liquid that looked like raw sugarcane juice. The smell was sour and biting, and somewhat reminiscent of a Lambic. The taste showed off both the sourness and salt, as this tasted more like an unsweetened cider than any other beer I have had before. I have had the German Gose a long time ago, but I hon¬ít recall it being this bold. Very light and refreshing to drink, and the 4% alcohol made it quite easy to drink.

3564,"2012-08-06",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2014 Pale blonde pour, thumbs worth of head.  Funky sour aroma, tart sour lemon candies, white pepper, sea salt.  Taste is the same - fairly tart, sour and salty.  Slight corriander, lemon rind.  Good summer drinker.","","Johnsense"
3564,"2012-07-24",3.6,"Thanks to Chris.  Pale blonde. Lightly hazy. Nice and tart. Light wheat. Acidity is great through the finish.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
3564,"2012-06-24",4.1,"22 ounce bottle that poured a very light hazy straw yellow color, aromas of salt, tartness, and some wheat.  Flavors are the same, not overly slaty, not overly sour, not overly wheaty, just a great combination of all three flavors, that were refreshing, and satisfying while I grilled out.  Really great beer.","Florida, USA","burg326"
3564,"2012-06-06",4.0,"Bomber from Piggly Wiggly, Myrtle Beach, SC. A very interesting beer indeed. A usual Hefe nose rises from a classic German wheat beer  body of cloudy yellow/off-white deliciousness. While there is little lacing, the beer is true to style being unfiltered and offering some little residue at the bottom of the glass. A mixed bags of flavors hits the palate on first sip, acidic lemon hits the sides of the tongue and throat but instead of some sours, the flavor evolves into a bready, salted peanut taste that is quite unique. I¬ím not sure I could drink this as a session brew but one glass a day should keep the Fall away. Great summer beer.","West Virginia, USA","WVHouseofBeer"
3564,"2012-06-06",4.2,"WOW....this was a surprise but maybe it shouldn¬ít be. Westbrook is doing sours as good as anyone in the US.   I¬ím not really sure of the difference between a gose vs. berliner.  Maybe the high amount of wheat?   Its a perfect summer beer.  4% , cloudy, very little head.  Its actually very salty per style.  Easily the saltiest beer I¬íve ever had but works well this the tart/sourness.  Maybe a touch under carbonated. Maybe the salt that is added kills the head and carbonation.  I dont get any coriander.    Tart, sour, and complex at 4%.  Awesome..  Wish i bought more.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","OldStyleCubFan"
3564,"2012-06-03",4.3,"Tap at Funky Buddha. It pours cloudy light orange, with a thick white head (which dissipates after a while). The nose is salt, sweet citrus, sharp lemon and herbal notes. The taste is refreshingly tart, juicy grapefruit, salt, lemon, home-made lemonade, bit of pineapple, light acidity and hint of herb, with a tart finish. Medium body, prickly carbonation and foamy mouth-feel. Balance is brilliant. This is light, refreshing and cleanses the palate. There are hardly any beers that taste this good at only 4%. Delicious!","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
3564,"2012-06-02",3.5,"On draft at the Funky Buddha. Light color with a cloudy center. Aroma has slight hints of lemon citrus and sour funk. Flavor is a little salty with a nice tartness on the back end.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
3564,"2012-05-17",4.2,"Bottle. Pours grapefruit juice. Nose/taste of sea salt, funk, banana, coriander, wheat and citrus. Perfectly crafted for the style. Finishes tart and funky with well-blended sea salt. Medium body.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
3564,"2012-05-17",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 26, 2012 There¬ís really not much more you could ask for in a summer beer.  Westbrook Gose is refreshing, sessionable, and incredibly fucking tasty to boot.  Tart and tangy as hell, with a noticeable briny bonus on the finish, this beer begs to be consumed as you go about your normal summer day, mowing the lawn, watering the plants, and riding with your brother to the hospital after he¬ís shot himself in the face with a bottle rocket.  (Your brother drinks Bud Platinum and thinks Creed is classic rock, by the way, so your brother is an asshole and deserved the Black Cat to the nostril.)   Anyway, the perky carbonation makes sure the beer doesn¬ít grow cloy or dull, yet doesn¬ít hamper the lingering tart finish.  Mr. Westbrook, sir, please make this brew a regular offering; yeah, sours are trendy and popular and all, but I¬íve never seen such an obscure, alternative beer style create such a broad fan base in just a handful of weeks.  Great beer.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"
