4107,"2015-04-26",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2015 Offered as a surprise at ZBF, a rare treat indeed to taste this in its pure form. Came from a small plastic keg. Very slightly hazy light blonde colour and, as expected from an unblended lambic, no head whatsoever. The aroma and flavour have all the elegance, complexity and tartness youd expect from an old lambic: tons of sour berries, lemon peel, leather, pineapple freshness, sour yoghurt, wood, basal wheatiness, dry white wine, old sherry, wet hay, apples; soft acidity, more easy lactic sourness than sharp citric sourness as youd expect from an old lambic, very fruity, very wheaty, very quenching and very complex, with a noble woody tannins drought in the finish. Soft sourness is key here, this is extremely refreshing. A draft sample at In De Verzekering Tegen De Grote Dorst proved a bit sharper, more lemony and even more refreshing; needless to say, each batch will be different, as is essential to lambic.  I remember how difficult it was to obtain this kind of beer when I started getting interested in it, more than a dozen years ago, but I am glad that the epitome of sour beer styles gains so much attention nowadays (thank you, American craft beer geeks...). Very nice way to kick off a tiring tasting session at ZBF. Too bad Timmermans is in the clutches of John Martins, I guess, but even they have apparently understood that it is worthwile to confront the beer festival visitor with the basic thing their commercial lambic are made of. John Martins ""rises in my esteem"", if I may litterally translate Dutch idiom...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

4107,"2007-05-31",3.3,"Spontanious weekend 07. Notes say: Similar to de troch lambic in that its a bit overly malty, however there are sour hints and tart fruit making a show, quite balanced. Theres a small woo hoo undr the ratring, i dont think its for the rating but it doesnt make sence for anything else?","bantervile, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","DonMagi"

4107,"2003-05-24",3.2,"Pale straw colour, no head. Nose of chaff, grain, lactic. Taste: this is pure wort. Virtually no acidity. Not bad in se, but totally unacceptable for this type. There's just some lemon-flavour retronasal. the aftertaste is much better than the rest - thank God. Medium-bodied, yes. Substandard for lambic.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
