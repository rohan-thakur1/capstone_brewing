4355,"2014-03-01",2.8,"Look what I found buried in the fridge! 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a clear chestnut color. Theres about two fingers worth of pale yellow head, featuring a soft texture and good retention. As it fades, some lacing is left behind.

S: It smells...like an ESB. The malt profile here is quite nutty, with just a hint of chocolate; and even for an old bottle, there is a bit of a hoppy kiss. Earthy hops, in this case. Theres also something funky I cant put my finger on. It doesnt really excite me, even for an ESB.

T: At first, the malts come through with some nutty, fruity, and even (occasionally chocolaty) notes. The malt backbone works decently considering I dont like the maltiness of this style. Before I know it, a wave of generic hop bitterness closes this one. The only hop flavor I really note is a touch of ginger. I actually dont mind this one having generic bitterness, because ESB. Its the jarring transition between the malt and the hops that gets me.

M: Creamy and soft, yet dry on the back end. Its pleasantly carbonated, as well. No real trouble with the mouthfeel - its more of the flavors that support the feel that raises my indifference.

O: Its nice to have your expectations met. Before reviewing this, I thought ""meh, ESB""; and after finishing this, I thought ""meh, ESB."" I didnt particularly enjoy this one, but thats due to my dislike of the style.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Medium to full bodied, oily, fair carb, with a drying bitter finish. Not enjoying this as much as i hoped.

4355,"2013-12-22",3.0,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a nonic pint glass. It had a best before date of March 2014 and cost $2.89 ($0.24 per ounce).

Appearance: Dull copper hue with some visible carbonation. Pours to a large, white, frothy head which laces and retains extremely well.

Smell: Virtually odorless. Hint of sweet malt. Thats about it.

Taste: Heavy Seas Winter Storm is described as an ""Imperial ESB,"" which would seem to be a contradiction in terms. While I dont claim to be an expert on the style, I do know what it should taste like and I dont think this is it. The beer is a strange concoction of malt flavor and strong hop presence. Its not that the flavors are bad, its just that they dont seem to match up.

Much like the aroma, the malt presence here is quite faint. Slightly rustic, slightly spicy character with a hint of cinnamon, some confectionery notes and a touch of dark fruit. While thats somewhat enjoyable, theres a strong hoppy character that overshadows it. Dank, earthy, spicy hops are strong from beginning to end. They dont seem to have genuine flavor, but are just there for spice. The problem is there isnt enough base beer to support this much hop character. At no point is it off-putting, but at no point is it particularly enjoyable. 

Drinkability: I was surprised by the low drinkability of this beer. While Heavy Seas Winter Storm is not all that complex, its definitely robust as the bitterness (and some alcohol) really make themselves known. I found myself drinking it in short sips. The mouthfeel is medium, and not all that smooth. It leaves a dry, bitter aftertaste. At 7.5% ABV there should be much more flavor here than there is. Thankfully, that alcohol is not too intense, though there is minor warmth to be felt.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

The nose has a faintly floral, malty aspect to it.  There seems to be a nice English side to it, but perhaps a choice of hops that is different.

Appearance: Pours out a translucent, darkened amber body with a finger-high, off-white head. Very thin, very sheer lacing on the way down.

Smell: Well-toasted malts seasoned with sugar and spice and a small dash of dried citrus peels, with just hint of alcohol in the background.

Taste: Malt profile tasting of deeply toasted and subsequently crushed bread crusts sweetened with a generous mixture of both brown sugar and common, ordinary, everyday table sugar. Slight fruitiness. Earthy, zesty, citrusy hop profile with a medium-high bitterness. The initial sweet, sugary quality comes straight back into the taste alongside the persistent bitterness for a bittersweet, lightly crisp finish at the end.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-plus carbonation.

Drinkability: Its alright, I suppose. Its sweet, its got ample bitterness, and alcohol (though thankfully not anymore than it does). Personally, Ive never been overly enamored with the Heavy Seas line-up, but you could certainly do alot worse than this.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

4355,"2009-08-04",3.1,"Gazing at my Winter Storm from Clipper City Brewings Heavy Seas line reminds me that the next season of Deadliest Catch should be starting soon. Every episode I watch almost makes me want to brave those very seas. Almost. I am far flung from the wintry perils of the Bering Seas, but over the years I have seen my fair share of rough and tumble seas. Being at the mercy of Mother Natures majestic and deadly beauty is a very sobering reminder of our place in the world.


Glistening mahogany, as if someone had just taken a fresh shine to it, shimmers in the light while dark ruby highlights are reflected in her depths. A small puffy head fades quickly into a ringlet, but some stirring of her seas tosses about scattered clumps of frothy lace while her nose is carried upward for my enjoyment. Warm, sweet, and moist cinnamon apples fresh from the oven seduce while plums, prunes, and raisins add a bit of meat to her body. Lemon and pink grapefruit gives her a playful bite while rum-soaked breads, licorice, vanilla, and wood receive a small helping of maple syrup. A plethora of wintery delights indeed. The rich bready notes soaked in rum and spices is ready and waiting for me as I dive into her inviting depths. Dry winter spices abound, almost like a dry rub on top of my tongue, a generous helping to truly soak in all those flavors. Sweet maple syrup and brown sugar provides a bit of a sweeter undercurrent while rummy warmth lingers long into her finish and my breath. The lemon and pink grapefruit zest nips at the back of my throat after each quaff, and then retreats to let moist dessert breads, rum, and moist plums, prunes, and raisins bring out more maple and brown sugar. This all may sound a bit heavy and cloying, but her mouthfeel and palate is rather bright and refreshingly brisk. Everything is tied together perfectly and as my Winter Storm subsides, I am left pleasantly soaked, but the better for it.


I am reminded a bit of Samuel Smiths Winter Welcome Ale because it too is clean, crisp, and refreshing, just like the Winter Storm from Clipper City Brewing. Weight, body, and mouthfeel aside, she is every bit as wintry as her name suggests, with all the spices, sugars, fruits, breads and rum a person requires to keep their spirits afloat and warm during those chilly months. A brew well-done; not great, but good.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

4355,"2008-02-02",3.8,"12oz bottle. Pours a deep, clear copper with russet and orange highlights. It pours up a smallish, light tan head that fades quickly into a very thin ring - but it leaves lots of lace on the glass. The aroma is thick - a pleasant combination of chewy, caramel malts and resiny, earthy, fruity hops. The flavor starts bittersweet with delectable malts - lots of caramel, some biscuit, and a touch of chocolate. The hops provide a nice background of subtle, flowery bitterness - but the front of the palate says this beer is more malt forward. The are tasty, fruity, English esters in there that strengthen towards mid-palate (and as the beer warms). The middle of the tongue finds more fruit and esters in the overall malt flavor, and a firm bitterness makes itself present. The finish is full of biscuits and dark toast along with some notes of caramel and English hops. The mouthfeel is quite nice - medium-full in body with a moderate level of carbonation.

A minimal, cream colored head quickly dissipates to a thin, wispy film with a small, foamy edge.  Random dots of lace cover the glass.  The aroma shows resinous, piney hops over a toasted caramel malt base.  Grapefruit is also present, though a bit muted.  The flavor is comprised of a very smooth, toasty caramel base, with resinous and citrus hops, and just a touch of chocolate malts.  The hops are really fresh tasting and considerably potent.  Really well balanced. Medium-light bodied and very smooth, almost creamy.  Pretty nice brew!

4355,"2007-07-12",3.4,"Bottle, a couple months old, drunk on 6/15/07I guess they dose this with fresh yeast, at least it says so on the bottle.  The head looks good anyways, cascading in to a dark beige, three-finger-sized giant and showing strong retention atop a mostly clear, mahogany-chocolate colored body.  Light lacing.Warm and endearing crystal malts are fully backed by pale malts and even a smidgeon of chocolate.  Green, leafy, lightly juicy and even somewhat herbal hops help add balance to the sweetness, though the malt dries out considerably towards the end, with some dry, rather earthy yeast that takes away some brightness.  Sweet vanilla emerges with warming, as does a light hint of alcohol.  Medium to medium-high strength of aroma with no flaws.Both bitter and yet oddly sweet at the same time, as citrus (grapefruit and orange, very straightforward) attack the palate, and choco-caramel sweetness rushes to balance.  Some breadiness/ a slight overabundance of hard, medium malts builds up while a definite sourish/tacky yeastiness sits on the end.  Pine breaks through and acidifies the palate somewhat, as well, on the finish, but the base malt sugars are notably soft and keep the beer drinkable.  These ""Imperial ESBs"" are just inherently flawed, in my book, the harder, breadier, more dry and earthy malts dont match the hops and the drinkability from the amped up alcohol suffers greatly.  But for what the brewer aimed to accomplish, its done quite well.  Still should tone down the hop acidity though.  Carbonation is light, yet fairly engaging.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

4355,"2007-04-04",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Candied berries ooze from the luscious caramel maltiness, dancing in unison with the assertive earthy and resinous hoppiness. Not as fragrant as it is flavorful, this friendly muscleman still is a joy to converse with.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the translucid yet snowy copper.
-The earthy, wooden hop nose is modest and pleasant with its citrusy edges, but it doesnt announce the entire range of flavors to come.
-The portly maltiness is one of this beers best features.
-The expansive carbonation thankfully breaks on the tongue quite easily.
-Whatever style you call it, its a great beer.
-The best before date is precocious.

4355,"2007-03-27",3.0,"Perhaps I had this beer too late in the season, but I was not too impressed.  The aroma was mostly hops, with grainy, earthy notes, some wheat, and maybe some pine.  There was some caramel malt too.  It poured a full amber color, with a small creamy white head; the beer was mostly cloudy.  Its taste was very bitter, and somewhat sour, and the presence of alcohol was detectable.  It had a thin, oily mouthfeel, with light carbonation, and after a wet start, it finished dry.

4355,"2007-03-21",3.7,"Pours brilliantly clear, with no sediment at all (despite claims to the contrary on the label).  The beer is topped by a frothy, initially three-finger thick, creamy-tan colored head.  The aroma is nice and hoppy with a berry like hop note as well as a herbaceaus, sometimes grassy note to it.  Behind this is a dry, biscuit-like malt character that at times smells like fresh from the oven bread crust.  The hop character is definitely the dominant note in the aroma though.

Quite sweet, this really amplifies that berry note from the aroma.  Flavors of sweet citrus are also found here.  The beer is not quite as thick as the sweetness might suggest; it is certainly chewy, with lots of caramelized malt sugars.  It seems to lean towards simpler malt sugars that are more directly sweet, but alot of the percieved sweetness could be an amplification of the fruity hop notes.  There are some nice sharp notes here as well and these provide some balance to the hop fruit notes and the sweet malt.  Green, herbal hop notes and a solid bitterness add notes of astringecy to the flavor profile that is quite nice.

A touch of hot alcohol is noticeable at times, but it is fairly hidden and seems to be brought out a bit by the sharp, herbal hop notes.  This is quite an impressive hop focussed beer.  I am really quite pleased by the quality of the two hop monsters I have had from this brewery.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Flavor found a core of caramel, toffee, and plums.. laced with mild rum.. with citrus and perfumey hops radiating outward... prickly alcohol intermittently.. warming, sweet finish.

Taste; citric and floral hops are upfront, but do not come off as overpowering. The toasted/biscuity malts do a very good job of balancing out the hop bitterness. Very nice, this is a beer that is good to savor, but would also be good to have a few of in a night.

It has a small frothy beige head at first which doesnt last very long, but the residual ring crown around the glass lasts the whole time and leaves some scant lacing marks.  The aroma is slightly sweet with toasted malt, caramel, and lots of citrus, pine, and floral hoppiness.  The flavor is malty up front and then an enjoyable hop flavor (citrus, pine, resin) and moderate bitterness slowly surfaces.  The finish is a nice blend of modestly sweet malt and floral hoppiness.  There is a moderate amound of lively carbonation, but the bubbles are quite small/fine and look like little golden balls floating up to the surface and then out the the edges.  The body is medium to full and has a little heft on the palate.  The end result is a very smooth and creamy beer that is both full flavored and quite enjoyable to drink.  Winter Storm is one of the better Winter/Christmas beers Ive had this season and I look forward to having it again next year.

4355,"2007-01-07",3.7,"Easily my favorite offering from Clipper City to date.  I think this is the Imperial ESB of 2005, rather than the IIPA of years prior given the best by 07.  Then again, the style may have changed again, as Im not sure what an imperial ESB would entail.  Pours a deep reddish copper with a healthy white head, slowly shrinking.  The nose is malty with strong floral American hops providing balance.  The malt bill seems a bit out there for this style.  Though its faint, I immediatelly pick up chocolate malts.  Less evident is some caramel malt, alcohol, and herbal to minty notes.  Subdued carbonation and a decent viscosity give this a fine mouthfeel with high drinkability.  The flavors are in line with the aromas.  Sweet malt balanced by liberal floral American hops.  The malt bill doesnt come across so heavy with the chocolate in the taste, though its there, as is the caramel.  Creamy, hoppy, and slightly chocolately dry finish.  Very dry hoppy aftertaste.  A surprising brew from a brewery that goes big but disappoints often times.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

The imperial ESB is an nteresting concept, since you start leaning towards strong pale ale territory, but they stick with the ESB concept here - the hops are in the background but play a supporting role (I can see hopheads thinking ""Why not just crack an IPA?"").

Aromas of pine and citrus, caramelized malts and a subtle toasted grain, and brief whiffs of woody alcohol.

Good carbonation and a crisp, smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel.

Pleasant ESB taste, the hops are more upfront than a lot of ESBs, piney and citrus with a little tongue numbing bitterness, sweet caramelized malts, traces of toasted grain, even barer traces of butteriness, and little alcohol flavor towards the end and a dry hoppy, sweet malty finish.

The taste is very hoppy, but balanced by a nice malt backbone that is highlight by a toffee sweetness that is followed by a definitive alcohal presence.

Green hops come flying out the gate, pursued by pumpernickel, caraway seeds, cleansing pine and pollination everywhere.  Light caramel and dryer sheets make a late aromatic entrance, confounded by a unique element of nutty pipe cleaners.  Flavor comes crashing down with a lick of stainless steel to hustle away every other flavor precursor.  Looking back, were dealing with mulberry, pine and cedar bark for earthy intonations and chloraseptic caramel lozenges for sweetening.  Theres a grassy quality as well, but its layered with warped maple sugar and diluted caramel.  Intimate and intimidated hints of cocoa and toffee.  Effervescent and mouth feel are holistically wonderful, and Id like to give a nod to balance, but the unsavory metallic twang holds me back.

Caramel, nearly toffee, dark bread malts follow slightly behind.  Smaller tones of medium-dark fruits (cherries, and the like).  Despite significant malting, a firm, spicy bitterness rests on the front of the tongue.  Late palate reveals more of the same, but with perhaps more acidity.  Bit of alcohol on the swallow, as well.  The body is on the bigger side of medium, has a slick texture, and lively carbonation.  Personally, Id like to see the US hops 86d so a bit more malt would shine through with less of a cutting feeling.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Sweet, with earthy nuances, lots of earthy, slightly lemony bitterness.  Drinks easy, but has intensity, too.  Chocolate malt emerges in the finish.
Spring 2006:  Orangey-brown colour.  The aroma shows earth, chocolate, a little bit of crystal malt and bright orangey hops.  The flavour is robust with those orangey hops meeting strong toasty notes with light chocolate in the background.

The flavor is sweet malt with orange hints and spicy hops that lead to a nice bitter, semi-dry finish.  There is a taste in there I dont care for (or perhaps its a combination of flavors)?perhaps orange caramel mixed with alcohol? The body is heavy, but I thought overly so for this brew.

My inquiry to the brewer got no response.  I decided not to add it, since I didnt think I had enough information to put in anything sensible, as even the name of the beer was a bit suspect on the draft menu.  In any case, glad to finally be able to enter a rating for the bottle version I found that is fortunately already here on the site.  The last beer of the night, after a long day of housework made tolerable by consistent beer sampling throughout the day and evening.  Pretty deep amber, ruby notes, slight head fades almost completely.  Aroma spicy, bit of spruce, caramel backbone.  Flavor is bracingly bitter, loads of hops, dirty pine sap, a bit of caramel, and a definite roasty note.  In the end, this sucker is simpley a blast of hop bitterness.

Lower end of the medium body spectrum, but there is some active carbonation.  More hops in the taste, very bittering all the way to the finish.  Not as agressive as I would expect from a 2IPA, but I think its held together nicely.   This one really needs to be warmed to get the malt to kick in and balance it.  Alcohol is hidden well.

Aroma is fruity, rosy, vibrant. Hoppy, yes, but none too bitter. Mainly fruity, though theres dull thud at the end. Doesnt give quite enough projection in this nose.

Taste: again, fruity, hoppy, but too short in that regard. Apples, melons, cherries, and a bit of citrus. Pleasant, but rather simple and shy of the bombast wed espect from a 7.5% Double IPA. The hops, what there are, are treating the palate with kid gloves, when we really would rather get it rough.

4355,"2005-11-14",3.2,"Courtesy of Pailhead. Pours transparent amber with no head. Aroma and flavor very muted. Oxidized hops with almost no malt backbone. Some faint sugar from the malt and thats it. Gat the feel this is old and musty, hasnt aged well.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"
4355,"2005-11-12",3.8,"12oz bottle from Goldtwins...Thanks Larry! Pours a medium amber color with a fomay off white head. Nose is light caramel, some outdoorsy straw notes, and some light hopps. Taste is very full, light caramel, light malt and a bitter, hoppy finish. wonderful silky smooth palate to say the least.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SuIIy"
4355,"2005-11-11",3.8,"Pours a clear amber brown color with a small amount of fizzy white head.  Aroma is extremely floral and well balanced with hints of citrus fruits.  Flavor is much more malty and sweet than I would have expected, with little in the way of abrasive hop tastes sometimes associated with double ipas.  Starts with a brown sugar taste quickly replaced by slightly sugared white grapes and then a bit malty and finally a slightly hoppy, slightly citric finish.  Overall, I thought this was a pretty good brew.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","roder60"
4355,"2005-11-09",4.0,"I live in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area, a place where until recently domestic micro-brewed beer was slim pickings.  Oh how the things have changed.  This week two new DIPAs entered the market at the same time.  And curiously they are from the same brewery.  The Clipper City Loose Cannon is a year around offering, while the Winter Storm will come ashore once a year.  I had to pick them both up, to see what all this was about.  The Loose Cannon was reviewed first yesterday, and here comes the Winter Storm, a Category 5 Ale.

The blue label on a 12 oz. bottle was in the standard style of Clipper City.  The beer poured out dark reddish amber, with total clarity, and a beige colored head.  The carbonation appeared steady and natural.  The aroma was not very hoppy at all.  Smelled more like a toned down English Barleywine, with brown sugar like malt being predominant.  The hops seemed to be those of spicy and earthy English variety.  The taste proved hoppier than the smell, with s strong herbal hop bitterness, backed by thick dark malts with a nutty sweetness.  The body felt thicker than it looked with an Old Ale like stickiness, and noticeable warmth.  There was a citric sourness coming through at warmer temperature.

I found the contrast between this and the sister beer quite striking.  Both clock in at identical 7.5 percent ABV, but the similarities end there.  The Loose Cannon is more heavily carbonated, light, highly aromatic, rather citric tasting, and not too bitter.  The Winter Storm is none of these things.  Maybe if I was to make a 50/50 mixture, Id get a classic DIPA.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
4355,"2005-11-06",3.7,"Poured a hazy amber color with a thin off-white head.  Fruity aroma with grapefruit and apple.  Caramel malty flavor with piney hops running through with a long finish.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
4355,"2005-11-06",3.3,"had this at Ale Atlanta.  Purty good. smells like oranges, lemons, corriander, spice.  Tastes like an IPA.  Pine, hops, very clean cool refreshing hoppy flavor.  Nice finish.  tastes kind of the way i would imagine the generic antimicrobial hand soap would taste.  good though.  lol.  could have a little more body and could look a little less thin and watery.  other than that, i have been damn impressed with Clipper City since having their stuff.","Marietta, Ohio, USA","LilKem"
4355,"2005-11-05",4.0,"Tap at my favorite restaurant.  Big hazy orange-amber glass, with small head and subtle hop aroma.  Huge hop flavor, quite bitter, but pleasant.  A great beer, but almost too bitter, but smoothes as you get towards the bottom of the glass.  A great beer.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","jde123"
4355,"2005-11-02",3.0,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2009 Bottle. I prefer the old version... the double IPA. Pours brown with a small head. Malt and hops in the aroma... flavor is the same with some licorice and roastiness involved.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","hershiser2"
4355,"2003-11-27",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2005 Bottle... Hazy, orange ale with a small, frothy, off-white head. Floral aroma with huge pine and toffee and ultra light cocoa. Malty and citrusy flavor. Lightly sweet up front, followed by moderate bitterness and earthiness. Full-bodied with lively carbonation. Lengthy, bitter, piney finish. Tongue numbing and soul warming! Definitely a different beer than last years Imperial IPA... not as complex, but definitely enjoyable!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
