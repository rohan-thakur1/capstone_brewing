1491,"2017-05-18",3.9,"The most interesting part of this ale for me was the clear (but subtle) traces of cereal (I guess this is the rye) and hay in the finish. Throughout the most prominent taste is of licorice, but also caramel/toffee and resin.

Dark brown/black with a nice and white-brownish head. Small head, but (even though it is smaller) it doesnt disappear.

Sweet, but it is balanced out by a brutal bitterness. The intense kick doesnt last for long, so it doesnt ruin the balance overall and is just an interesting (and tasty) feature of the ale.

Bitter and sweet, with a little acidity to it. The foam ruins the ale a little though, as it seems to be growing in the mouth.

A delicious ale, tastes like how I imagine tar tastes like.","Drammen, NORWAY","brewberg"

1491,"2016-05-06",4.2,"Kolor:  Ciemnobrązowy. W tym szkle nieprzejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Niewysoka, średniopęcherzykowa i drobnopęcherzykowa.
Gruby, trwały dwucentymetrowy kołnierzyk przykleja się praktycznie na stałe do piwa. Wraz ze zmniejszaniem zawartości szkła, kołnierzyk pozostaje wciąż taki sam. Jak pianka na cappuccino. Po dolaniu kolejnej porcji, piana nagle zastyga w bezruchu, tworząc betonową zaporę.
Lacing ponadprzeciętny. W tej kwestii wzorowa postawa. 
 Zapach:  W aromacie przede wszystkim tony baryłek czekoladowych. Mam nieodparte wrażenie jakbym również czuł szczyptę rumu. W drugim podejściu mój nos wyłapuje paloność i odrobinę kawy. 
 Smak:  Fantastycznie zbalansowane piwo. Raz po raz zmienia swój charakter w trakcie degustacji. Raz wydaje się słodkie, potem goryczkowa, a dalej wytrawne. 
Składowe budujące smak to: gorzka czekolada, kawa, baryłki czekoladowe, paloność, odrobina karmelu i orzechy włoskie.
Niesamowita oleistość od żyta. Smaczne, gęste i wyborne.
Alkohol nadaje szlachetnego tonu.
Porter do powolnego sączenia i długiego delektowania się jego smakiem. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Kolaboracyjne piwo Browaru Nøgne Ø z Terrapin Beer Company z Athens w stanie Georgia, USA

Bardzo dobry Imperialny Porter, którego z czystym sumieniem mogę polecić każdemu fanowi craftu.
Nie jest z pewnością najlepszym Imperialnym Porterem jakiego piłem, ale na bank znalazł trwałe miejsce w moim sercu.
To co go wyróżnia w tłumie to: fantastyczna piana, która co ciekawe odbudowuje się przy kolejnych uzupełnieniach szkła i długo utrzymuje się na powierzchni.
Smak, który zmienia się w czasie i mam wrażenie, że w miarę upływu czasu staje się coraz bardziej zaskakujący.
I na koniec żytnia oleistość, która sprawia wrażenie gładkości i kremowości w ustach.
Kropeczką nad ""i"" jest wspaniały balans poszczególnych składowych.

At times it became quite creamy and had some sweeter chocolate, yes milk chocolatey in certain ways which worked very well with the roasted malts and nuttiness that the rye malt gives.

Pleasant sweet, spicy and malty aroma of warm chocolate sauce with cognac, gingerbread, dried banana, black pepper, rye bread, dried banana, kahlua, pipe tobacco, shortbread, toast, raisins, candied figs, hints of vanilla, red wine, dried grapefruit peel, liquorice, brambleberries, coffee beans, pine needles (i.e. American hops almost like in a black IPA but much more subtle) - something new seems to pop up every time I take a sniff. Tangy onset of condensed candied fruits, dates, raisins, with only a narrow trail of sweetness, paired with a deep rye sourishness and spiciness, soft carbo with a very creamy, velvety, thick body, flowing into the throat like fresh cream; a liquorice-like flavour plays somewhere in the middle, over a deep, thickly layered malt backbone, caramelly in the most noble sense of the word, nutty, bitter chocolatey and lightly coffeeish in the end, with just a dash of bittering espresso on the back of the tongue, further reinforced with peppery, piney, dried citrus peel hop bitterness, lingering fruitiness and warming, brandy-like alcohol; the overall impression is very malty but deeply, softly spicy as well (likely the rye effect mixing with the hops), with a perfect balance between sweet and bitter. Smooth, clean, pleasantly warming and technically perfect imperial porter.  I am not yet familiar with Terrapins beers, but the Nögne Ö quality stamp is unmistakably there.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

1491,"2014-11-25",3.0,"In short: A very sweet and highly roasted black ale with spiciness and moderately rye presence. If you have a sweet tooth.
How: Bottle 500ml, consumed 2.5 year before expiration date.
The look: Brown-black body topped by a medium tan head with medium retention.
In long: Nose is burnt cereals, a certain spiciness (no specific spice), some rye, some smoky notes reminiscent of smoked almonds. Nice mouthfeel with a full body that is lighten up by an active lively carbonation. Taste is on the sweet side. Lots of husky grainy burnt malts, a slice of rye bread, a lot of residual sugars, roasted nuts, chocolate cake icing, a peppery-ish spiciness, a sip from an cup of old cold coffee. Sweeter and heavier than expected from a 9% porter. The massive sweetness finds opposition in a astringent bitterness coming froth the high roasted level. Just too sweet for me, very low drinkability here. A well made beer that just didnt work for me, doesnt score very high on my hedonistic scale.

Very smooth mouthfeel, warming. Interesting beer, as it as both sweet and bitter components, melting together in a very balanced way, resulting in a complex body.

1491,"2013-11-03",4.7,"Pours clear, very dark reddish brown, almost black. Forms a very nice, light brown head that sits for quite some time and leaves a nice lacing on the sides of the snifter. Aromas on the nose are dominated by spices, pepper and a dry, dusty smokiness and woody aromas too. The alcohol content is amazingly not that noticeable on the aromas. Aromas on the tongue are quite similar to those already mentioned, but with a nice dark tinge to it. The taste is semi-sweet, with a nice somewhat dry finish, and a lingering aftertaste. The mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for a hefty and complex porter like this, but in a good way. This beer is excellent; one of the best Ive had.","Grimstad, NORWAY","Wischylini"

Sad I couldnt bring ,ore back with me. Aroma of alcohol, coffee, chocolate, dark bread. Pours thick. Opaque black-brown. Super luscious mouth feel - thick and creamy. Taste of dark chocolate up front, bitterness comes in slowly changing it to a rye bread and then coffee flavour. Bitterness has slight hop character remaining that is noticeable in the finish. There is a warming boozy quality but it does not detract. Wonderfully balanced and delicious beer.","","ncube"

The taste is full bodied, smooth, rich chocolate, some roastiness, a fair amount of booze & a kind of tangy quality reminiscent of a port or other slow drinking aperitif. Nice stuff though I am not getting the kind of spiciness I usually associate with rye...  A touch of smoke after warming, very pleasant.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
1491,"2013-10-07",3.8,"My Bottom Line :  
Black pepper-laden caramel and roasted malts move into molasses and resinous hops in this rich and flavorful dessert brew.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A sheet of foam covers the brown-edged blackness.
-The long malty finish is endearing.
-Some chocolate peers through here and there.
-This ones begging for a peppery steak.

Slick looking, oily, spicy, earthy aroma with moderate spicy, resinous hop notes and plenty of dark malts intricacies, including grenoble nut powder, woodsy smoke and dark chocolate amidst other. Deep yet not overly invasive alcohol brings as much sweetness as the malts themselves. It makes for a dry ensemble and a fairly original one, the rye certainly providing a nice touch in that regard and turning the focus away from what could have been astringency; those dark malts are taking a lot of room, but maintain an oiliness and a smoke focus that fit together nicely. Not extremely complex, but posting plenty of different flavors in a round and seducive fashion we are not used to seeing together and hence flavorful and captivating. Very nice recipe and indeed a sound concept to bring Terrapin and Nogne O in the same brew room.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1491,"2013-02-22",3.7,"(50 cl bottle from Den Nordiske Ølhandel; Batch 808/818B; BBD: June 6th 2016; Brewed on June 5th 2012) Pours black with thick, creamy tan head. Good retention and beautiful lacework. Aroma is subtly bready with toffee and rye notes and a hint of alcohol and herbal hops. Creamy texture, soft carbonation, full body and a roasted, warming finish. Taste generally follows the nose. Rustic but quite well balanced and pleasant. A much better experience than years ago when I ended up paying upwards of 20 USD for a bottle of Nøgne Ø beer at Aker Brygge that turned out to gush a third of its contents on the table in front of me.","DENMARK","humlelala"

1491,"2013-02-02",4.1,"500 ml bottle.  Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head.  Head retention and lacing are both good.  The brew smells like roasted malt, dark fruit, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, spicy rye, and some molasses.  It tastes like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, rye, coffee, wood, and a bit of licorice.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its creamy and has moderate carbonation.  Its also smooth and easy enough to drink.  I think this is a good overall brew, Id certainly buy this again.  $9.99 a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

1491,"2013-02-01",4.5,"Talking about porters, this is almost like a stout. So smooth palate and taste, almost creamy. But aroma and taste itself is very textbook like, although almost too smooth to be a porter. Still, there are those roasted flavors. Licorice, malts. Wide taste spectrum and sufficiently masked taste of alcohol. Sufficient carbonation.

Moves to cured black olive and animal. Taste is very dry, coffee acid, lemon, waxy dark chocolate. Dry, acidic coffee finish. Palate feels silky but still very dry and roasty. The longer I sit with this the better it gets. Not as olive brine heavy and harsh as Nogne O stouts and not sweet and decadent like Terrapin stouts.

Roasted dark malt aroma with a spicy rye presence thats complimented by earthy hops, lactic cream and sweeter notes. Really strong rye character along with burnt toast, dark chocolate, caramel, toffee and oatmeal. Slightly boozy and on the verge of becoming acrid but the rye adds another dimension of complexity that helps the nose. 

On the fuller end of medium bodied with a surprisingly hop forward flavor profile. Very dry and bitter with a dank, earthy pine needle presence that lingers over the spicy rye and roasted malts into a bone dry finish. In desperate need of some sweetness to combat the acrid, burnt malt profile and overpowering hop bitterness. As it warms and the palate adjusts, the rye character and subtle malt sweetness comes toward the forefront. Hints of burnt dark chocolate malt, oatmeal, robust coffee bean and caramel before finishing with subtle boozy heat. Not bad, but too hoppy for the style in my opinion and could use some more sweetness for balance.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

1491,"2012-05-06",3.9,"Sampled @ Hanne på Høyden. This one pours a dark dark cola-brown body with a small quickly sidesticking tan head. On the aroma its really lovely roasted and sweet with dark dried fruits, dark chocolate, sticky dark caramel and hints of some alcohol. Quite lovely. It has that nice thick and almost viscous, creamy texture with a average, small bubbled carbonation level. In flavor its not unexpectedly, dark, bitter and roasted. I get some clear dark Belgian chocolate, with tons of roasted malts. It feels really round and delicious in the flavors this. It also has a extreme-lasting warming roasted chocolate aftertaste thats literally making me taste the beer for a very long time after Ive swallowed it. Theyve done it again! 11.04.2012","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Aroma is somewhat faint, with mild licorice, hints of dark chocolate, rye grains and coffee. Taste is much more evident: strong tones of licorice, coffee and rye bread-like cereal tones, herbs and grass. The flavors seem well integrated in a fruity kind of way as opposed to roasty. Hints of alcohol, but well hidden. Palate is thick, velvety and very nice. A solid imperial porter, but I long for a more noticable rye flavor as well as a more noticable aroma. Still, this is very nice.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

1491,"2012-03-22",4.1,"Bottle. It pours a dense, almost creamy, tan head of two-finger size. Both lasting and lacings producing. Not black in color, but pretty close. The aroma is on the dark side, as expected, with roasted malts, mocha, milk chocolate and some alcohol notes and a pleasant piney, citrus peel-like hoppyness. Mellow and pleasant. Really pleasant actually, even though Im not in the mood for dark, heavy ales for the moment. The flavor continues what the aroma started, its oily and smooth on the palate, although a bit warming. Soft carbonation, and towards the end the bitterness adds another dimension to the flavor. As mentioned, Im not in the mood to drink on the dark side these days, but I certainly enjoyed it anyway. 120322","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
