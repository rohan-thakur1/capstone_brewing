1966,"2011-05-31",4.0,"In short: A full bodied and very hoppy roasted stout.  Very tasty and very well balanced
How: Tap at brewpub
The look: Black body topped by a medium tan head with good retention leaving lots of lacings on the glass
In long: The strong nose is medium roasted, cacao, coffee beans and milk chocolate.  Taste packs a lot of crunchy roasted chocolaty malts, milky notes, black cake, roasted coffee beans.  Overall crunchy mouthfeel/sensation.  Nothing in the way of fruity flavors but I didnt feel like it needed any.  So far that would be a very competent roasted stout.  But lets not forget the hops.  This beer is massively hopped for the style and the resinous leafy hops work admirably well with the rest of the beer.  The name Libre Échange means Free Trade, it is a complicated business concept.  But the other day I read an article in a business magazine, it was the.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1966,"2011-05-25",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
This engaging Foreign Stout develops plenty of chocolate and coffee aromatics before milky notes and raisins lead to a tantalizing finish of roasted malts and resinous hops.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the brown-edged blackness.
-The roasted malt personality is sustained. I love it when the finish is full of flavor which doesnt necessarily come from the residual sugars.
-The body is round, yet the finish doesnt feel sweet at all. 
-That aroma is boastful; a very engaging dessert of a brew.
-Malts also offer caramelized sweetness.
-The resinous hops and roasted malts are levelled in the aftertaste.
-Dieu du Ciel Stouts are often stellar; this is no exception.

Appearance : Pitch black with a small creamy head. Lots of lacing.

Aroma : Lots of coffee with roasted malt and great coffee notes. Light fruits.

Taste : Lots of coffee with some hops and roasted malt. Nice coffee finish with some hops. Great soft carbonation. Nice coffee bitterness. Nice dark chocolate.

Overall : Wow very nice beer. Highly drinkable and packed with flavours. Intense coffee without being even slightly harsh. Dark chocolate probably helps in mellowing all that coffee.
