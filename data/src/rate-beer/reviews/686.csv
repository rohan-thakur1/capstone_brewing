686,"2012-09-17",4.1,"Entering old rates. Draft @ CCB. Garde comme base la Big Sound, couleur brune/acajou sur un beau col beige presque moka. Ici cette bière est propulsée sur une autre dimension gustative avec un effet agréable de traitement en barrique de Apple Brandy qui ne couvre pas toute lexpérience. Pointe résiduelle de douceur vanillée avec ce côté malté grillé et profile de noix de pécans qui ajoutent un fini et une rondeur de palais très agréable. Le tout est accompagné par un fini fruité noir qui est déjà présent dans la version de base. Au final, tous les ingrédients de cette version se complètent bien les uns les autres.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

686,"2010-11-23",3.9,"How does big nuts sound?? well this one tries to provide an answer. The sound when pouring could be it - its different because off this different bottle. The bottle is pretty nice with a screw on/off top. Most of all it reminds me of a medicine bottle. Coo. The pour is dark brown with a nice dark head. The aroma is nice and complex. I get both vanilla and some sour notes as from redwine like there could be wooden notes. Somehow it kind of reminds me of the aroma found in a Rodenbach. The taste is huge and dilicious . Mild soury notes that mixes perfectly up with the caramel and malty flavours. The palate is a bit milder that usualy seen with CCs brew - and actually it suits it well. It can easekly be too much - but this one isn´t. The finish isnt that long and bares only a light sweetness as from caramel fudge along with s mild bitterness. Pretty good beer.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","lassem"
686,"2010-09-28",3.6,"Tap @ CCB.  Murky dark brown body with a thin tan head.  Nose is nutty and malty with notes of cherry, vanilla, oak, and brown sugar.  Medium to full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation.  Flavor is a bit too sweet for me, lots of brown sugar and sweet booze, some roasted malt and cocoa, big toffee and pecan notes with lesser notes of cherry and oak.  Sweet boozy finish.","Tampa, Florida, USA","HOPSHUNTER"
686,"2010-09-20",4.0,"Growler This beer rocks! Pours dark (not quite black) with a small, creamy, off-white head. Nutty, spicy, malty aroma  singed caramel, cinnamon, toasted pecans, pistachios and coffee. Full-bodied and oily with soft carbonation. Less sweet than the base beer, the rich flavor offers malty notes of chocolate, caramel and toasted nuts with a mild wood component. Bittersweet, malty, spicy finish.  A chocolate, ginger and cinnamon blend coats my tongue and leaves me wanting more. Thanks to dchmela for sharing this world class brew!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
686,"2010-09-19",4.1,"On draft at CCB. Pours almost black with a thin tan head. Aroma is sweet and malty with notes of chocolate, ripe dark fruit, caramel, brandy, vanilla, light nut overtones. Flavor is about the same with a nice, sweet brandy flavor with notes of chocolate, toffee, nuts. Medium to full body with a lightly boozy finish.","Tampa, Florida, USA","kiefdog"
686,"2010-09-14",3.8,"Draft at Cigar City. This one pours a hazy and dark mahagony brown colored body with virutally no head or lacing to speak of. The aroma is based in dark, toasted caramel and toffee malts with a touch of cocoa roast and a nice oily, nutty character as well. The apple brandy adds a nice dark fruit component along with gobs of sweet vanilla from the oak. The flavor follows and is based in the rich, darkly roasted caramel and toffee to go with some toasted pecans and plenty of sweet vanilla from the apple brandy barrel. The pecans add a nice nutty overtone and a oily feel to things. Some dark fruits lend further depth and sweetness from the apple brandy. Full bodied and slick on the mouthfeel with minimal carbonation and a slightly sticky finish. This is a very rich and sweet beer that could easily be used as a dessert beverage. I really like what the pecans do, but its still just too sweet to enjoy a lot of this.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
686,"2010-08-31",4.0,"Sweet, smoky, and booziness in the aroma - delicious! The dark brown color has a nice tan head on top. The flavor of sweetness from the vanilla mixed with the peat, malts, and booziness of the scotch ale. Nice medium to thick head as well.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
686,"2010-08-29",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2011 Growler shared by Kan. Poured a cloudy syrupy brown with a brown head that dissipated slowly to the edges. Aroma was sweet with red fruits, pecan, vanilla and a bit of brandy. Flavor was similar with a nice light sweet fruit note the built throughout the beer and combined nicely with the vanilla and more reserved pecan note.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
686,"2010-08-29",3.7,"Growler thanks to Kan.  Pours a dark brown with a thin head.  Rich caramels fruits lots of oaky richness in the aroma. Burnt malts flavors that lead into a combination of malt (maple syrup, vanilla, oak) and red fruit sweetness that probably emanates from the brandy. Dry finish with lots of malt.  The sweet fruit becomes more apparent as it warms up, but good.  8/4/7/4/15","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"
686,"2010-08-29",3.1,"growler shared by KAN.  Thanks!  pours a near dead dark brown.  aroma of chocolate covered cherries, apple acidity.  flavor is slighyl boozy sweet melon, cherry cough medicine, and brandy.  almost likea  fruit beer.   touch of nuttiness.  okay.  too sweet and didnt particularly care for the fruit character.  the slight sour apple note gave this a bit of life, but in the end, not one of my favorite CC beers.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
686,"2010-08-29",3.7,"32 oz growler shared by Kan. Thanks! Pours a murky reddish brown, dark , small light head dies to a film, laces minimally. Aromas are pecan big, with a touch of red fruit moving in, cherries and prunes, dark brown sugar, brown malts, vanilla, a touch of acidic apple brandy, rich oak and vanilla. A decent fruity acidity and pure roasty pecans with a touch of sugar. Initial is medium bodied, roasted pecans and brown sugar malts, brown malts, touch of vanilla, cherries and a touch of cough syrup. Richer malts, lightly acidic apple brandy sticks well with rich vanilla, faint cinnamon. A sweeter beer overall, but the complexity of flavors works very well with it. I really liked the nut element and the oils the seems to have picked up from them","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
686,"2010-08-28",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 29, 2010 32oz growler from hopshunter... Pours a very deep dark reddish cola brown, somewhat muddled, and a barely existing soapy head... Aroma of big nuts and red fruit to be exact darker caramel and toffee... Flavors are sweet from the brandy barrel with dark fruits but finishes on a somewhat drier note. Good carbonation. Decent brew but a tad sweet.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
686,"2010-08-26",3.7,"Draft at Cigar City for the Double Barrel Zhukovs release.  Pours a hazy, nearly opaque, dark mahogany brown color.  There is virtually no head or lacing, though some mild staining does show on the glass.  The nose is very sweet, showing rich notes of darkly toasted caramel and toffee, hinting at a bit of cocoa roast, with a very nutty, sort of oily overtone throughout.  It is noticeably sweeter than the regular Big Sound, no doubt a result of the apple brandy barrel, which, by the way, imparts a rich vanilla component.  Unfortunately, it also covers up some of the dark fruit complexities present in the base beer.  Flavors follow suit, again primarily caramel and toffee driven, both darkly roasted.  Toasted pecans are distinct and welcomed, but the apple brandy just lends a bit too much sweetness.  Very lightly carbonated, the body is slick and round, nearly full in the mouth.  It finishes a little sticky as well.  This one is all about decadence, through and through.  Rich, sweet, sticky, dessert-like.  The flavors are there, but it is just to sweet to be considered elite.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
686,"2010-08-20",4.2,"Pours up deep dark murky mahogany with low carbonation short lived dark tan head. Wow, interesting rich aroma with dark fruitiness, sweet brandy like booze mixing with rich nuttiness and prune / cherry puree covered wood. The taste begins smooth, soft and creamy ushering in sweet dark fruitiness and quickly picking up wood, sweet brandy like booze and then a dash of chocolate. By midway sweet nuttiness comes forward. Some booze, wood and a touch of roasted malts break up the sweetness from time to time. Wonderful.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
686,"2010-08-20",3.4,"From a mini-growler acquired in trade with matboz.  Dark brown pour.  Aroma of toffee, vanilla, and lots of brown sugar.  Sweet taste up front with a bit of a sour twang going on.  Lots in the flavor that follows the aroma, but its a bit too sweet and syrupy for me.","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"
686,"2010-08-16",4.0,"Drank with Mikey right after the Sound of Big Wood. Mini-growler thanks big time to David. Pours a murky brown color with a medium beige head. The aroma is rich brandy barrel, some chocolates, light nutty and fruity notes. The flavor is very nice and extremely similar to the Big Wood; sweet rich dusty brandy barrel, light chocolate and smooth but strong fruity malts. Warm, but not boozy. Having both side-by-side the the Big Wood and Big Nuts are very similar. The main difference being the tart cherry nose in the Big Wood. This is fine with me because both are damn good.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
686,"2010-08-14",4.0,"growler from my awesome girlfriend from the brewery.  open the cap, and hazza there is some carbonation!  the sound of big wood didnt have any...

pours a nice dark dark brown, the darkest brown i have ever seen.  minimal head, essentially just the head that clings to the sides with a beer hole in the middle.

nose is nutty, fruity, and scotch... smells pretty boozy.

taste is interesting.  scotch ale is definitely present, then it turns to nutty on the finish with a hint of vanilla.  caramel malts in the middle.  this is nice.  I wish it was more carbonated, but Ill chalk that up to the growler.    I think I would have liked the Sound of Big Wood better, if it was more carbonated.  But this one has a much better mouthfeel, and the carbonation makes it better for me.","Oregon, USA","crusianbeer"
686,"2010-08-13",3.0,"Growler shared by Moejuck. Not sure what they did with what here, but it was a bit of a mish-mash: light sour notes on the aroma, whiskey and pecan notes throughout with a define present maltiness. Transit may have done something to it, but Ive had plenty of growlers shipped that werent affected in this way. Not bad, but really not worth the trouble. Big Sound on its own is way better.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"
