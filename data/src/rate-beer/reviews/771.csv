771,"2016-07-27",3.8,"Pours hazy brown with a beige head that laces the glass. Malt, spice and citrus hop aroma. Taste is a good mix of malt and hops. Another great beer by Beaus","Ontario, CANADA","ChadPoole"
771,"2016-06-12",3.6,"bottle. Poured deep amber with a big off-white rocky head. Spiced citrusy aroma. Medium body, tight carbonation, sticky tart finish. Flavour of barley malt, caramel, a touch of spice, yeasty, herbal hop note. A bit heavy.","Chatham, Ontario, CANADA","Strangebrewer"
771,"2016-04-23",3.6,"Big bottle, Ann Arbor, MI via Mulmur. Hazy brown. Sweet malt aroma, some faint bubblegum. Balanced, brown sugar flavour with autumn spice. Bright finish.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","markas101"
771,"2016-03-10",3.6,"Part of their Oktoberfest 2015 4-pack. Pours a clean darker amber colour with a creamy-bubbly beige head, good retention and some creamy lacing. Fruity (red apples), dark malt aromas with some light caramel, hints of wood and some mild grassy notes. This hops shows up in the start of the taste to finish with caramel and fruity malts. A little nutty, some spices and well-blended bitterness. A tad dryness making this one a refreshing bold Dunkelhopfenweiss brew.","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
771,"2016-02-07",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
Fruity and earthy notes dominate this flavorful brew, leading to subtle greenness and questions as to what they were trying to do with this ingredient blend.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A healthy head of foam bobs atop the cloudy brownish dark red.
-Mouthfeel is relatively dry, which increases drinkability.
-The finish is rather short, barely bitter.
-The fruitiness is quite complex, spanning from grapes to pears and even citrus.
-Not quite sure the use of darker malts is harmonious with the chosen hop and yeast profiles. But the brew remains enjoyable nonetheless.

771,"2016-01-29",3.6,"Bière brune-orangée, légèrement voilée, très effervescente, et surmontée dune abondante mousse brunâtre très dense, compacte, crémeuse, et qui se réduit tout doucement en formant un large cratère. Arômes de pain grillé et pâtisserie, avec un peu de grain rôti, de noix et de sucres foncés (caramel, cassonade, tendance érable). Effluves également un peu terreux, feuille morte, avec quelque chose de résolument herbacé, gazon, herbe aromatique, coriandre Présence possible au nez de phénols de fermentation (clou de girofle, eucalyptus) et dun houblon légèrement résineux (conifère, cèdre) et fruité (citron, orange et autres agrumes). Nez fort intéressant, belle complexité, bonne intensité. En bouche, pétillement élevé sur la langue, breuvage mousseux, mais onctuosité plutôt faible au palais. Au goût, malt principalement céréalier (pain grillé, grain rôti et noix) avec léger sucres foncés et un houblon qui domine rapidement jusquà la toute fin de bouche. Le houblon est principalement herbacé et aromatique, tout en étant légèrement résineux, poivré et citronné, avec contribution fort probable de phénols de fermentation. Finale à lamertume modérément élevée, bière déséquilibrée en faveur du houblon et de lamertume, intégration des différentes saveurs tout de même bien réussie, complexité intéressante, intensité très élevée en bouche. Très bonne bière!","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","pumpkinhead2"
771,"2016-01-28",3.6,"Une mousse extravagante trône au-dessus dun liquide cuivré. Elle prend possession de la paroi. Un parfum de dessert aux herbes. Des arômes de caramel, de pain et de houblon. Des effluves poivrées et au travers tout ça, des vapeurs dalcool.Ça picote la langue sans bon sens ce liquide. Cest poivré, un peu sucré, âcre, minéral et quelque peu amer. Par moment, des saveurs fruitées tanguent au gré des gorgées. Je nsuis pas certain de celle-là. (Lot 4514 Emb. 09/24/15) (1724-250116)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","AlainG"

On ne retrouve pas les caractéristiques du malt de blé. On a limpression de boire une ipa anglaise.

The aromas are mild (which is the unfortunate norm for Beaus). What is there is cherry macaroons, and cereal grains.
Tastes are more of that with some toffee hints, and a bit of brown sugar.
This is the third beer from their 2015 Oktoberfest box, and my clear cut favourite thus far.","","Randy4Beer"

Nose has caramel, banana, spice, dark fruit and some very light grassy hop notes. Light sweet toffee malt base with an interesting spice developing and continuing through the finish with a moderate bitterness. Mouth is medium+ creamy with average carbonation and a long bitter finish.

771,"2015-09-12",3.8,"800th rating brings the 3rd of 4 from the Beaus Octoberfest 4 pack sampler (of which this is so far the 2nd best). Phew, thats a lot of numbers. But listen: this is a serious & interesting brew. It perfectly fits the dark, rainy slightly melancholic pre-autumn weather today. Save this one for after dinner & sip it slowly. Gorgous in the glass: dark & hazy with a untamed cap of foam on the surface. Almost soda-like mouthfeel. Bright flavours of banana & rich malts meets a subtle spiciness. Despite the addition of cane sugar this is not a sugar bomb. The sweet gale -- ok, ok, I googled it after reading the ingredients -- is in the background & adds a hint of sophistication without being overwhelming. I know, I know, some of my beer geek friends dont approve of my fondness for this brewer but I have to say that once again that I am super impressed with this 4 pack sampler & will be snapping up some additional packs when I see them.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Freaky_tiki"
