4266,"2015-02-26",3.9,"Poured up on tap at the brewery where it exhibits a hazed gold body that supports a thin white head. The aroma offers up loads of noble hops that are spicy and floral and then light candied tropical fruit. The taste delivers spicy to earthy noble hops and then bitter floral hop notes running above a thin river of sweet candied tropical fruitiness. The bold yet integrated hops nearly completely cover the echoes of lagery essence. Yummy.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
