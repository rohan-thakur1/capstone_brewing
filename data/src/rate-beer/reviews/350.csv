350,"2017-06-18",4.0,"Bottle (375 ml) at home. Clear bright orangey-golden with a medium white head, good retention, leaving a long lasting ring of foam. Aroma is rather strong - ala Boon Mariage Parfait - with oak features and funk aplenty, musty notes, cognac fruitiness and light apples notes. Taste is gently acidic but mostly funky with oak, oak spiciness, lemon, green apples (but not in a bad way), musty notes, wet hay, cognac fruitiness and light alcohol presence. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Lemony finish with some fruitiness, oak and funk. Very complex but still on the drinkable side. The cognac barrels, despite being 4th fill, seems to give this one more fruitiness than usual Boon blends. Nice funk and oak features. Very good!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Piana na początku dość bujna, biała, szybko redukująca się do pierścienia na powierzchni piwa, pozostawiająca po sobie skromny lacing.
Aromat hmm... pachnie fenomenalnie, to co najlepsze można wyobrazić sobie w tym stylu. Zaczynając od początku, na pierwszy plan wybijają się zdecydowanie dzikie aromaty, jest tutaj sporo stajni, świeżej skóry, trochę nut rustykalnych(zwietrzałego siana), następnie dochodzi przyjemna owocowość, swą obecność manifestują gruszki, jabłka oraz kwaśny agrest. Po zamieszaniu wychodzi subtelna nuta ziołowa z kapką pleśni i świeżego drewna.
Przechodząc do smaku, po aromacie powinien być równie genialny, no i nie mam co do tego krzty wątpliwości. Oude geuze jest lekko kwaśne, wpadające w cytrynę, po chwili dochodzą jabłka, gruszki i kwaśny niedojrzały agrest. Następnie dochodzą nuty funk, świeża skóra, stajnia, zwietrzałe siano. Jakby tego było mało swą obecnością szczycą nas pleśń wraz z subtelną ziołowością.
Piwo pozostawia uczucie szorstkości na języku, takiego lekkiego ściągania, a finisz pozostaje w tonie ziołowym.
Przy każdym łyku geuze przyjemnie musuje na języku. Pijalność pomimo tak dużej złożoności jest wysoka, ale chcesz brać łyki jak najmniejsze, żeby móc długo degustować w tak genialnym trunku.

350,"2017-03-18",4.3,"The third one in this series of Boon Monoblends (a fourth is coming, I heard), this one consisting of lambic aged in a century-old ex-cognac barrel (90%) blended with 10% young lambic; the first Boon product which consists entirely of lambic brewed in Boons new brewhouse. Bottled on April 18th, 2016. Opens under high pressure, lots of smoke escaping from the bottle neck and even foam slowly rising to the opening and beyond, but perfectly manageable. Very thick, frothy, densely moussy, regularly shaped, off-white head, slowly diminishing and eventually showing holes in the middle, but in all very well retaining, crowning a beautifully deep orange-hued gold, cristal clear at first with columns of fierce bubbles rising up from the bottom; turns a warm hazy pure orange with sediment added in the very end (and with very careful pouring). Noble, quite idiosyncratic and very inviting, funky aroma of unripe green plums, yellow grapefruit peel, damp hay stacked in an old barn, old books with dried weeds between the pages, pierced by stings of redcurrant, some of the typical Boon old lambic chlorine but less so than in the previous editions, wet wood, old lemons, very old dry sherry, unripe gooseberries, wild apples and indeed a faint, sweetish hint of cognac (not less subtly so than in Cantillons 50° N - 4° E, so noticeable as a faint hint among all the lambic goodness); adding the sediment in the end, however, brings in a foul, almost rotting potato-like odour scarring this idyllic impression of a rural September afternoon - but then fades away again. Crisp onset, teeming with lambic esters of course, in a spritzy environment, almost cava-like; unripe stonefruit, wry grape peel and grapefruit tartness and bitterness, no sweetness worth mentioning; sedate lactic sourness dries the entire palate but the more vinegary or lemony acidity remains at bay and limits itself to gently sharpening the sides of the tongue, as is to be expected from a geuze containing 90% old lambic. Nice bready maltiness (and wheatiness) support this expressive and still restrained array of sour and bitter fruits and leads them to an utterly quenching, bone dry finish where woody tannins coarsen the back of the mouth; an earthy, leafy and even briefly tonic water-like old hop bitterness adds complexity and afterwards, a glow of jenever-like alcohol is noticeable, but in the most subtle and elegant manner imaginable - if only it were this well-dosed in so many other 8% beers. Lovely stonefruit and green berry tartness linger in the throat. I will not take that weird rotting smell, which briefly showed up near the end of the bottle, into account here: like the previous Monoblends, this is a geuze of high class and stunning beauty, in which the old lambic character seems to be even more refined and balanced than in the two previous ones. Beautiful geuze, I am looking forward to the fourth one now.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
