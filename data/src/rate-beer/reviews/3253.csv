3253,"2017-05-19",4.1,"Bottle. Golden body with a large, frothy, white head. Aroma of toasted grain, floral hops, musty basement, apricot. The flavor is moderately to heavily sweet and lightly bitter. It finishes lightly to moderately sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. A straightforward tripel and thats good. It has none of the overwhelming clove spice, banana and annoying sweetness of many American tripels. Plenty of depth and Belgian character. Taste of honey, light lemon, floral hops, light mustiness. Delicious.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"

3253,"2017-05-06",4.2,"DATE: May 7, 2017.... OCCASION: Game night is over, but Game of Thrones-themed beer never fails to deliver... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip snifter.... pours a medium amber body that floats some serious driftwood as sediment... the head is white as the North, just as resilient and foamy with appropriate lacing.... a swirling centrifuge twists violently in its midst... lacing is appreciable and organized... first aroma kicks of banana, bubblegum. candied apple, honey, and toasted oats--quite a nostril full... the impact of its sip is full on at the teeth, with an awakening of the throat as well... medium-bodied, but no fooling its 9% ABV--and no apologies, considering its namesake... the wheat is detectable, making for a deliciously soft balance between the oats and hops (which suggest Saaz or Tettnanger) that evokes a breezy, flowery setting--perfect for a spring night such as this... goodness, there is something strange at work in this one, like Arya Starks time in the House of White and Black.... should this be celebrated as a tremendous one-off with distinctive character, or written off as simply another fine Ommegang Belgian that will sneak up and hammer my consciousness once I finish it? God bless Ommegang for their tireless work to bring savory Belgian fare with subtle variations that make each release a celebration in its own right.... short lived but highly recommended....","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"

3253,"2016-11-09",4.0,"Dark golden. Creamy white foam is mostly lasting. Clean honeysuckle, poundcake, apricot, cake frosting, and puttylike yeast aromatics. Fluffy and expansive carbonation with some crunchy edges. Rich, palate-enveloping wave of candy sugar laps the tongue before a cleansing punch of flowery hops and a staunch black-pepper phenolic surge. Strikingly firm and cleanly extracted pils malt is exceptionally buoyant, providing a stiffness that reinforces the immaculate attenuation and mirroring the woody hop underpinnings. An apricot fruitiness sparkles vibrantly as it links up with a wheatlike slickness, but a cottony dryness keeps the slickness perfectly at bay. Lemony acids gracefully wash over the palate, adding levity to the sugar-charged body which continually causes the lips to smack. Touches of marmalade, dried apricot and a rummy richness align with the dry piecrusty malt. Alcohol is expertly cloaked within. Yeast leaves its clean but rustic mark all over the body with a dusty and puttylike characteristic, as a nearly-airy phenolic note vivifies the elegant hopping. Dense, nectar-infused herbal bitterness digs deeper into the palate before merging with the dusty yeast and browned banana-bread notes. Well-attenuated finish is cohesively composed of flowers, honeycomb and a lengthy, fresh squeezed sugarcane juice aftertaste. As with the stellar dubbel in this series, this is absolutely spot-on to style and immediately evokes the Old World upon nosing the glass. What it might lack in complexity and dynamism, makes up for it with its focus, not to mention a fermentation character that couldnt be more polished. Awesome German hop character, to boot!

Ommegang was pretty mediocre for quite a lot of years there, and they still are somewhat hit-and-miss to this day, but they are capable of some seriously yummy, authentic, no-bullshit stuff the past 5 years or so. This is one of those beers where they dont mess things up with spices or too much or too little of anything. This is right on the money for a real Tripel, even if I might want it just a BIT more complex and dry in the finish. Just a bit...so close to mind-melting though, right on that high 3s / low 4s borderline. Its yeasty, its bright, its phenolic, its got just the right amount of alcohol warmth, its clean...you really couldnt ask for much better, especially from an American brewery (even if theyre owned by a Belgian one, obviously). No junky banana or syrupy sweetness or stupid spices...they keep it real, son...and it works. AND they only charge $10 for a 750mL bottle...which may not be great, but it sure as hell is better than a lot of scam artists charging 50-100% more for grossly flawed product. I hate that its in 750mL bottles, though, honestly, because its so good that its hard not to punish my liver with the whole thing in one night (despite one of my good friends being able to enjoy a re-capped/corked bottle 24 hours later, I never have been able to find the same joy the next night, so I either dump the remainder or just go ahead and punish my body with most/all of it). Right up there with Allagash for one of the most authentic Tripels you can find in North America (Boulevard used to be great too, but alas...they are long since off their game). UPDATE: beware batch XL080316BBT1, which is what Ommegang put in the holiday gift packs...its a butter-and-wort drain pour!","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3253,"2016-10-17",4.3,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 8/17/2016. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big lemon, orange, pear, apple, peach, apricot, white grape, peppercorn, clove, coriander, light banana/bubblegum, honey, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, moderate bready/candi sugar malt, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of huge lemon, orange, pear, apple, peach, apricot, white grape, peppercorn, clove, coriander, light banana/bubblegum, honey, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of yeast spiciness and moderate herbal/grassy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange, pear, apple, peach, apricot, white grape, peppercorn, clove, coriander, light banana/bubblegum, honey, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, moderate bready/candi sugar malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitter/spiciness and carbonation; increasing through the glass. Medium-high carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderate crisp, creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible tripel! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, moderate bready/candi sugar malt, and earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, and dangerously easy to sip on for the ABV. A really amazing offering all around.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

3253,"2016-10-11",4.0,"750mL, corked and caged. Nose of honey and estery Belgian yeast, touch of dust and bright sunshine, grainy Pils; has that nice hint of mustiness and wood but otherwise fruit and citrus line the edges. Otherwise wheat and heavy, Hefeweizen-like banana. Pour very pale but ends up rich golden in the glass, head is large, rocky, and lacing white. Taste semi-dry, its grainy (graininess lasts into the aftertaste) and mildly bitter (clean) but yeast combined with the hops are giving jammy banana and orange notes, less lemon peel. Smooth full body but not fat, rather dense and finely articulated, again rallying the spirits of grain and minerally esters. Drying lightly chalky feel, average carbonation and a bit of yeast despite by careful pour. Fresh and vibrant, alcohol hidden well, dusty Saaz/Poperinge base, honey, some interesting amber-copper and wooden notes, tannic dryness as if it picked up something from a barrel (supposition only). Digestible!  Simple and worthy. [2016.10.11: 4.0]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
