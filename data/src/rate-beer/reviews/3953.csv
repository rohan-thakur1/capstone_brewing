3953,"2016-06-27",3.0,"Cheap little bottle at home. Pours syrupy yellowish. Nose is decent plum and berry. Tastes of mostly plum, some melon, honey, hint of rice and alcohol. Touch syrupy and sweet but not overly so. Fine little sipper glad my bottle is minuscule though prefer my umeshu in small doses","New York, USA","Jow"
3953,"2014-12-06",2.8,"Bottle. Clear, flat. Aroma is very fruity, with plum, berries. Taste is also fruity, clean, light. OK.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3953,"2013-09-12",3.6,"Bottle shared with my wife, using one of the new sake sets she threw at the pottery studio. Pours clear. Some soft rice with a hint of banana and some plum. On the thicker side of medium-bodied, quite sweet but not quite cloying. A very slight bit of tartness shows up as it moves into an almost chalky rice finish with lingering alcohol. A touch too sweet for me, but still tasty enough.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
3953,"2013-04-28",2.4,"Dziwne polaczenie. Sake z winem ze sliwek ume. Te sliwki nadaja ton temu skake. Winny sliwkowy aromat dominuje. Alkohol ukryty ale i tak uderza troche do glowy. Wspaniale komponuje sie za to z tradycyjnymi sushi. Pasuje takze na chlodne zimowe wieczory.","Radom, POLAND","Grzesiek79"
3953,"2012-12-14",3.1,"This bottle Sake from a bottle shop in NY poured a extremely small frothy  head of medium sized bubbles that quickly diminished and left behind a clear colored uncarbonated body.  The aroma was extremely mild with only slight notes of rice and no vinousness at all.  The flavor is different than most Sakes.  It had notes of alcohol but very subdued.  The flavor has a slight fruitiness to it.  The mouth feel is smooth from start to finish with the flavor coming out in the end of the swallow.  All in a decent Sake and one I would consider sharing with a non-Sake drinker so as to not scare them away as it differentiates itself from the more vinous varieties of Sake.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
3953,"2012-05-20",3.3,"Cherry and buttercream aroma, quite buttery. Crystal clear pale yellow. Syrupy sweet cherries. Warm like a cherry cordial, but with not trace of chocolate. Medium bodied, but weightless and clean as it slides down the gullet. Tasty but with little sake character, over infused. Better warm, not hot, so the base sake comes through better","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
3953,"2009-11-09",2.2,"Bottle with Ume, but labeled at 14.6% ABV. Slightly yellowish or golden with some light legs. Aroma is sweet with honey, melon, marzipan, plum and that wooden stick that a doctor puts in your mouth to hold your tongue down. Flavor is cloyingly sweet with maple and plum and then finishes acidic. Blah. Syrupy. Bad.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
3953,"2009-10-24",2.7,"Glass in Tokyo Cafe, Amsterdam. Golden appel body with apple nose. Taste of plums, apples. Quite a sweet and acidic flavoured-Sake.","Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA","altonbrownd"
3953,"2009-10-22",2.2,"Bottle: Pours a light pinkish color but mostly clear, no legs. The nose is odd; fruity with koji and dry rice but it comes off more like bitter fruit skin and musky rice, which seems almost like chlorine or pool-water. The flavor is semi-sweet and nice with a little sake notes and a little ume note. Rounded finish with a little more pool-water. Interesting blend, a little sweet in the tail, but its not cloying, which is better than nothing.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3953,"2009-05-09",3.2,"Light, sweet plum aroma layered over a fairly standard sake nose.  Sweet, fairly acidic plum flavor stops just short of being cloying.  A bit simple, but not bad","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"
