Nose:Citric, fruity aroma. Well hoped nose. Light sweetness but hops are more on IPA than typical British bitter.

Appearance:Clear amber, neat good creamy off tanned head.4-

1265,"2007-03-05",3.9,"Clear copper body with a large off-white head.  Foresty hops abound in well malted and slightly oily body.  The roasted malts character reminds me of toasted bread with caramel spread and some nuts.  Nicely balanced by plenty of tasty foresty hops resin along with some citrus fruit flavours.  Bitterness of medium intensity.  This is closer to what Im expecting from a typical APA or even an IPA than a typical Bitter.  One of Bedondaine most regular beer,  it has been there since day on and its still one of their best.  I really love that brewpub.

1265,"2006-09-06",3.7,"Draught pint at the brewpub with Olivier on 8/26/06.Firm, dirty-beige head is well-retained, as seems to be the case here.  Monumental lacing proceeds down the glass, with an ever-so-slight haziness in the deep auburn-chestnut body, with hints of beige and tan highlights.A whopping array of English hops burst forth, vibrantly, from the nose (as vibrant as English hops get, I guess).  Some bits of nuttiness, soil, dust, herbs, lots of grass and bitter!  Yep, very bitter and pungent, probably the most Ive seen from English hops.  A strong floral-herbal perfuminess sits on the back of the nose, and the malt slowly creeps in.  Seemingly rather dry itself, it adds a touch of breadiness, very light caramel and pale malt sugars, with a touch of fresh house yeast and light minerals.  Trails off in to grassiness and some perfumey hop zestiness.  Quite strong in strength, very sniffable.  Clean.Bitter hop notes waste no time in making themselves known in the flavor.  It certainly is moderately acidic, very much so for an ESB-like malt base.  Though there is certainly extra/ample malting, its not underattenuated, and much of the malt is felt in texture.  Light papery, breadiness, bits of crusty brown bread and then quickly giving way to round, estery fruitiness.  All the while, light hop acid builds, with a strong floral-grassy undertone that sweeps in the on the finish to clear any malt sweetness that may remain.  I do get a touch of soapiness/astringency, no doubt inevitable in such a creation.  Wonderful texture is almost sticky, yet not sweet in the least.  Just well extracted and attenuated, without a huge water/malt ratio.Yum yum yum.  If you showed me this creation on paper, it would be about as far away from something I think Id enjoy, neither liking tons of hops, English hops, or English malts very much.  But the unfiltered nature, appropriate carbonation and all-around careful brewing show through and provide delight nonetheless.  No alcohol noted.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

I guess the big dump of bready yeast and creamy biscuit malt help out in that respect. despite what Im saying here though, I probably wouldnt want to make this my session ale but its a nice one to try and I will certainly get it again given the chance.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"

The 200 IBUs was the only part of the description understandable in English.
I got a nice glass of mostly clear amber brew with a decently sticky off white head. Moderate hop aroma with lots of malt. The flavor was mostly bitter but the hops were mostly in the bittering and more was needed in the flavor. Very smooth.

Sticky sweet hop leaves, alomost resinous, but very floral, hop-heads will enjoy the aroma of this offering.Whoh, lip smackingly bitter, this Beer is advertised as 200 IBUs.  Is it really that bitter?  Perhaps, because it felt really itchy in the back of my tongue and the top of my palate near my uvula.  I took a sip or two, went to the bathroom and took the time to look around at the great surroundings of the pub, and after that long the aftertaste was still quite prominent, as if I just took a pull off my pint.  Even so, the malts are quite heavy sweet and flowery enough to give this monster enough balance for me to want second helpings.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

1265,"2005-06-24",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2007 The Lure:An immensely colorful bouquet of flowers rests gleefully on a soft earth, watered by caramel and apricot juice. Hop leaves fly about in the dry-hopped gusts, as miscellaneous fruity esters hang on to the timid almonds. Resinous, dry-hopped goodness, with a cask-bubble head (although this is not on cask). 

The Festivities:Advertised for now as 200IBUs (although that might change after the lab tests). A muscular leafy and conifer bark hop bitterness garnishes the back of the tongue, but surprisingly balanced by a capable malt sweetness and grain character. Body even emulates the size of a regular ESB, medium-sized, very drinkable, a session is definitely possible with this one. A wet soil diversifies the flavor profile, as citrusy hops barely touch the finish to help ease the bitterness. All Nugget and Goldings here, by the way. Nicolas is a balance freak, and it shows even in this massively-hopped ESB. A true testament to his talent, imho. My prediction is that the lab tests will state that this is more like 80-90 IBUs though.
