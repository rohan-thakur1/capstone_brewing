The flavor is crisp bitterness, with a nice, mild, malt backbone. The palate is medium to heavy, very sticky and astringent, grainy, and clingy. The aftertaste is long and relatively unpleasantly bitter. Overall, this is very hoppy for a pilsener, but not very hoppy for a Terrapin beer.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"

838,"2012-08-25",3.5,"Bomber.  I actually missed out on trying this way back when.  Im glad to see Terrapin releasing this as part of their limited election year vote for retired beers.  This pours a dark gold color with a thin off-white head that lasts.  The lacing is spotty but consistent.  The scent shows a mix of straw, grass, earthy notes, pils malt, and baked goods.  This is actually fairly clean and refreshing for the style; theres just a bit of alcohol sting that starts to show in the finish.  Bready malt flavor stands out here, with sharp bitter hops, and some grass.  The pils malt lingers a while along with the alcohol in the finish.  This is a pretty good beer but not great.  As the case with many in the style, just a tick lower abv (1%) and I think it would be even better.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

838,"2010-04-26",3.8,"Poured from 2007 vintage keg on-tap at Bocktown.

A-Body is a slightly translucent golden hue. Served with an approximately 1 finger creamy white head which has pretty nice retention before fading to a very thick collar and traces of lacing are left all the way down the glass.

S-Lots of pale malt comes through initially with a slight edge of German hops at the end a just a touch of phenols. Smell is somewhat subtle and rings through like a typical German Pilsner.

T- Flavor is much like the taste-only less subtle. The initial taste is loaded with pale malt sweetness and just a touch of alcohol. The hops really come through for the finish but are a touch more bitter but less biting then I am sure this was when it was fresh. Finish is pretty clean leaving nothing to linger.

P- Wow. This is great. Nice medium weight, very smooth, oily body and medium carbonation. Wouldnt have expected this much from a Pilsner.

O- This is good, crisp, and refreshing- but not my favorite of the style. The ABV is somewhat noticeable but still subdued. Looking forward to trying a fresh batch in the summer.

The aroma is strong and sweet with a ton of bread and grain, as well as a good deal of grassy hops. This was the 2007 edition, so it had some age on it. Cloying sweetness mixed with a huge grassy presence made for an unpleasant flavor experience. It was just way too sweet and the hops were not enough to balance. Alcohol is almost strong.

838,"2008-08-13",3.1,"Appearance: Clear, bright, golden-copper body with a thin, white head which deposited significant amounts of lacing on the way down.

Smell: Pale malts, slightly grainy, and with a light caramel scent. Floral, spicy, even citrus-packed hops arrive but soon yield to a background note of booze.

Taste: Pale maltiness with a touch of caramel sweetness. Ugh, theres that booze already. Spicy, floral, citrusy hops with a resounded bitterness which coasts along until well beyond the dry hop smack on the finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. Somewhat sticky mouthfeel.

Drinkability: In all honesty, Ive never been a fan of this beer, try as I might. The various components dont come together to form anything cohesive or really all that refreshing, as it is more than a chore to finish on a hot summers day in Atlanta.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The flavor is a bit different, showing the pale malts and the fruit, but substituting some of the dough for citrus hops.  The body is medium-full, with a cloying, sticky palate.

Pours darker than I expect. more brown than golden pilsner. Fairly flat in appearance without much of a head. Nose is malty and reminds me of walking into a brewery for a tour--boiling wort and all. Husky grains. Definitely my favorite aspect of this beer.

Flavor is more malty without the biscuit crispness and hop tang of a traditional pilsner. Honestly, what makes this a double? More malt? Higher ABV? Definitely more of a malty, bready flavor and more alcohol. but not much more hops. A bit out of balance and leaning towards the malts. Crisp-ish but not light.

Brewed in Maryland which pisses me off because this is supposed to be a local brew. The color is a lovely peachy/gold, but looks can be deceiving. The Lager color just doesnt show, which is great a twist to the lager color. Is this common with European Lagers? The hops shine through but they arent crisp. The beer is nice and smooth. I am very impressed with the smooth texture of the beer. Taste some fruit, but it is hidden so it is hard for me to determine what this fruit actually is. Also, the alochol is well hidden.

Had a better balance than on overly hopped IPA. Long finish","Powellville, Maryland, USA","beachbum25"
838,"2007-01-07",3.4,"2006 bottle thanks to ambergirl.  Poured a hazy medium golden with a short cap of white head.  Nose picked up an array of lighter fruits upfront... sweetness laced with alcohol... some herbs and maybe a hint of candy beneath.  Flavor focused on pale and fruity malts with moderate herbal bitterness and some caramel.. alcohol was present but never got in the way.  Quite smooth on the palate with sticky sweetness lingering along with citrus and herb bitterness.  Good brew.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
838,"2007-01-06",3.4,"12 oz. bottle and on draught at Taco Mac - Lindbergh City Cen.  Pours an ever-so-slightly hazy golden orange with a medium amount of whitish crown.  Decent retention and decent lacing.  Aroma is pretty hoppy compared to a normal Pils, with good herbal, citrus, and floral tones.  Also a good amount of sweet malt and some yeast detected.  Flavour is very malty but balanced with an assertive helping of hop bitterness.  Mid-way through the tasting, caramel sweetness comes and goes, but the finish is more acerbic and bitter than smooth.  A decent hoppy aftertaste is left in the mouth, but it is more grassy than floral or citrus.  Even though its 8% ABV, you cant really detect much of an EtOH burn at the back of your throat - its really sneaky.  This is overall a nice beer, the first Imperial Pilsner Ive ever had, so I definitely need to try others to get a better feeling about the entire category, as a whole.  Im glad I have easy access to it, but to be honest, I wouldnt miss it.  Highly recommended for at least one try, though.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","marksahara"

The finish isnt completely dry though thanks to the very full body of the beer. There is a hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. The beer is pretty good - but seeing the term ""Imperial Pilsner"" definitely had me hoping for a nose more like Dulle Tev (not a pilsner for sure - but it has an aroma that exploded with Saaz hops - Saaz being the typical hop variety in authentic Czech pilsners).","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Flavor is well balanced, fairly crisp and clean malt with a moderate bitterness that really comes out in the finish.

Hops are fairly fresh but could be more dominant. Malt is fine but there really is a need for pils malt with such a beer. There is a graininess to this instead of a biscuity malt quality.

Some mild corny notes are there and obvious, bright hops. This is dead on for the style, just huge in taste for a pils. It finishes a bit sugary with strong papery hops. If more pilsners had this kind of all around strength, Id have more respect for the style, though I was expecting something unique here since my only other foray into the imperial pilsner territory was Rogues crazy take on this style.

Even though these guys are not known for it, I would have liked this to be a little more aggresively bitter.  I think thats really the only way to extract the balance out of this style,.

Flavors are straw, acorn, bubble gum, finishes with an alcohol bite that leaves copper, and buttered toast. Not a bad brew, but not one I could drink many of or regularly. And not because of the abv. This beer is a bit much even for 12 ozs. Oh well, time to curse the dead.

838,"2006-07-15",3.4,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2006 Any first impressions?
-Sumptuous foam over the translucent honey gold, drawing intricate lacing.
-Oily sweet malts and ghostly herbal hops fail to entice a nose dive.
-The cushy, honeyed maltiness doesnt develop enough flavors to my liking, apart from residual sweetness, and faint astringency.
-The round mouthfeel is very comfortable, appropriately carbonated; definitely one of my favorite features of this beer.

What if you dig deeper?
-There is a hovering wooden hop bitterness and aroma, but it isnt going to entertain for long.
-An alcohol tinge doesnt bother at all.
-Theres something I dont like from the yeast signature or the result from the union of their malt and hop selection.
-Well-brewed, this maibock hell/malt liquor cross is just not producing a flavor profile which interests me. But it remains well-brewed.

Strong grainy malt aroma, with a hint of pine and floral hops.  Flavor is bittersweet, with the bitterness somewhat more prominent and the sweetness in the malt backbone.  Hops are mainly bittering and somewhat woody, and the malt has a slight dark-fruit character in addition to the graininess and general sweetness.   Fairly creamy on the palate.  Pretty good---it really is basically a stronger pilsner, which it does well and wisely doesnt try to do more than.  I do find it slightly too bitter on the finish initially, which mellows out after about 3-5 months of aging.","Falmouth, Cornwall, ENGLAND","Delirium"

In spite of these facts of life, this one was a welcome entity in the box goldtwins sent me.  The pour was hazy deep golden, with a 1-finger off-white head.  The aroma was tropical fruity, with some hops, pale malts, canteloupe, tangerine.  The flavor was pale malty, with a strong hop presence, some fruity apricot, and some honey.

838,"2006-06-23",3.4,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2007 The third stop on the 2006 Terrapin monster beer tour was arrived at in 12 oz. brown bottles with a best if enjoyed by date of 33806FY.  When the heck is that?  But since I picked this four-pack up today, freshness was no concern of mine.

When poured, the Pilsner heritage was clearly evident in a golden clear body, and a small creamy head fed by ample carbonation.  The lacing left of the sides of the Pilsner glass was quite thick.  The aroma was much more hop driven than the average Pilsner.  The spicy aroma of American noble hop clones was close enough to German originals, but a bit of grapefruit rind (from the Mt. Hood perhaps) smell did creep in.

The taste was spicy and sweet, with the lightness of body and the persistent effervescence preventing this beer from becoming a Maibock.  The aftertaste was more similar to an IPA than a pilsner, with a lingering bitterness.  The alcohol content was not perceptible to be anywhere close to the 7.5% listed on the label.

A good drinkable Imperial Pilsner, thats not quite the mind numbing beauty that was Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner.

Update 2007
The delightful Imperial Pilsner from 2006 has come out this year as a total mess.  The looks were handsome, but the sickly sweet smell told me right away that something was off.  The taste was an awful mixture of cooked corn, rusted metal, and rotting vegetables.  What a load of crap.
