Lovely fragrant aroma of lime peel, yellow grapefruit, lemon blossom, freshly grated ginger, green banana, starfruit, sourdough, unripe melon, zucchini, dry dust (dusty dried flowers), dried wormwood, white pepper. Crisp flavor, fruity elements in a subdued but elegant way combining a very restrained sweetishness of green banana with an equally restrained sourishness of kiwi and starfruit, refined carbonation tingling a bit but not numbing and perfectly fit for the style, supple and lightly bready maltiness in the middle, bit cookie-like but in a very subtle, non-sweet way, lightly resinous hop finish, pleasantly bittering but mildly so, yet long and aromatic, dry, with peppery and grapefruity notes, even a light hint of pine retronasally.

Cette bière s’orne d’une robe dorée pâle dominée par une tête blanche crémeuse avec une bonne rétention dans le verre.
Olfactivement, elle développe des arômes richement fruités apportant des parfums qui mettent l’eau à la bouche : pomme, mangue, agrumes, raisin et un peu de pêche et d’ananas.
Gustativement, elle dévoile tout son potentiel houblonné et floral avec des saveurs de fruits tropicaux, d’agrumes, de pins et des notes plus légères de caramel. Pour une IPA on peut noter que son amertume est assez douce.","","AntoineGRD"

3350,"2016-01-31",3.9,"Sampled May 2015
A steady pour into my IPA glass produces a three finger thick, pale, off-white colored head. The beer is a light golden color that shows a brilliantly clear, bright gold hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells down-right juicy with tones of tropical hop fruit character; lychee, guava, some kumquat zest, spicy tropical fruit notes, and super floral tropical notes, as well as an almost dank leaning, overly ripe fruit character that is hard for me to describe.

Light bodied, but has enough viscosity to not come off as overly thin with all the hop character, there is also a nicely effervescent carbonation here that provides some texture, and an additional bit in the finish along with the firm, hop bitterness. The hop fruit character dominates this beer with flavors of lychee, guava, gooseberries, and something that I want to describe as spicy mango, with grassy herbal notes. There is just a touch of malt character, it suggests at pale malt cracker like notes, and perhaps a touch of sun-baked straw, but really this beer is about the hops. Meyer lemon zest, some floral / ripe tangelo zest notes, and even a touch of grapefruit add some citrus layers to the hop fruit character.

3350,"2014-09-01",4.0,"Poured up on tap at the Temecula location where it exhibits a clear deep gold body that supports a nice looking tight off white head. The aroma offers up inviting pineapple and mango tropical fruit notes as well as some cantaloupe. The taste starts surprisingly soft on the palate. It quickly gets into bitter hops that seem floral and then lime mixed with grapefruit. To midway more and more tropical fruity mango notes surface amid some thin yet firm resiny pine hops.. This is a solid Session IPA.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

3350,"2014-07-18",2.5,"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a strong fruit especially grapefruit aroma. Taste is of hops and fruit mixed to leave a slight bitter aftertaste. A hint of grass in the flavor, that lingers for a little bit after the swallow. A good session I enjoyed at the restaurant in San Diego Sorrento Mesa.","Diamond Bar, California, USA","Barreras"

3350,"2014-07-05",3.8,"16 oz sample on tap at The Davis Beer Shoppe. The aroma is quite hoppy with pine, grapefruit, and mango. Really nice. Virtually transparent golden body with a nice white head and good lacing. Starts with some citrus hop flavors (lemon), becomes a little sweet in the middle. Finishes with a fresh moderately bitter grassy hop flavor. Nice. A little big for a session IPA, though.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

3350,"2014-06-28",4.3,"Despite my inclination to support the local San Diego beer scene, Ive never been a big Strauss fan--nor, for that matter, do I gravitate toward the bitter Stone bombers. However, when I was offered a free tap sample of Herr Karls homage to the Mosaic hop, I was won over big-time, wowed, as it were, by the intensely aromatic spice that isnt bowled over by intrusive IBUs.
Brought home a growler from the 4-S Ranch location and am drinking it as we speak. Very nice, and sessionable indeed--the best beer these guys have ever made.","California, USA","GrainBeltMan"

3350,"2014-06-07",3.3,"A really nice aroma and taste to start here. Nice showcase for the hop. The flavor and aroma fade however as the beer warms up and becomes more middle of the road. Good hit of bitterness here.","Glendale, California, USA","beersearcher"
3350,"2014-06-05",2.8,"On tap at the brew outlet on Columbia St, San Diego on 18th March 2014. The serving lady told me it was a wheat pale ale brewed on-site, I assume this is the same beer? Anyway I tried it. Slight haze to the golden look, white unlasting head. The Mosaic hops along with the wheat and other malts marry together neatly and produce a pleasant if slightly bland combination of aromas and tastes. Refreshing more than testing or exciting.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

Smell: I get a lot of sweet citrus and a touch of sharp hops in the nose.

Mouthfeel: Light bodied.

3350,"2014-05-31",4.4,"On Draught at Blind Lady Ale House. Great Mosaic hop aroma up front. Smells very tropical with stone fruit flavors add to the mix. Pours slightly cloudy, seems some wheat was used in the brewing process but contributes to nice mouthfeel. Tastes like a full bodied IPA but without the abv. Nice to be able to drink an IPA and not always feel it in your head. A great hoppy session. One of my new favorites!","California, USA","ryan1murphy"
3350,"2014-04-15",3.6,"Draught at Churchills Pub & Grille, San Marcos. Hazy pale golden/yellow beer with a small but lasting white head. Fruity pine apple aroma, mango, citrus, grapes, some peach.
