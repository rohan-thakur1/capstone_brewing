174,"2016-05-25",3.7,"500 ml bottle purchased at Beverage Warehouse in Los Angeles in October 2014 while on a business trip ($8.99). POURS a very dark brown with only a hint of light coming through at the edges, with only a thin layer of brown foam. AROMA of complex artisanally roasted coffee (thick, tarry, ""green""), roasted / smoked nuts, ashtray, and light chocolate. FLAVOR of earthy acrid coffee, thick espresso, smoky dark malts, with some lesser chocolate notes emerging into the finish. Lighter in body despite the big coffee presence, but then its only 6% (seems like usually big coffee is accompanied by big ABV, but not here).

The nose offers a massive blast of fresh, dark-roasted coffee, but it has a burnt quality to it. Same on the palate, except that it definitely tastes like bitter, burnt, black coffee to me and thats about it. A background of chocolate milk and vanilla latte adds sweetness and milkiness, but this is unending coffee, coffee, coffee! The beer is full bodied, medium in carbonation, and a bit astringent from the burnt, bitter coffee ground character. Overall, its awfully one-dimensional and has too much burnt character for me to really get into this beer. But theres no doubt that it tastes like real coffee, if thats your thing.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

174,"2013-07-22",3.6,"Tap at Haven Gastropub in Pasadena. Black with red highlights. Excellent sheety lacing of latte foam. Nose is rich dark chocolate coffee and roasted bean. Taste is dry and dusty, quite acidic though. Herbal bitter finish. Solid coffee porter, not gritty. Just a bit too much acid extraction from the coffee.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

174,"2012-12-24",3.9,"This beer doesnt pretend it is something that it isnt. Its coffee, plain and simple.

Pours a deep brown-black with a thick chocolate head. Aroma is coffee; burnt coffee grounds, a touch of cocoa. Flavor is long on the coffee; rich black coffee with, again, a hint of chocolate. This goes down smooth. The real draw to this beer is the aroma and the flavor. If you love coffee and you love beer and you want to marry the two, find this beer. However, it is not complex. This beer is as linear as they come. Still very tasty.","Highland Heights, Kentucky, USA","Chuckaduck"

Aroma of fresh ground coffee, toasted and roasted malt along with milk chocolate.  Flavor of chocolate covered espresso beans.  The mix of coffee meets chocolate is excellent.

174,"2012-03-25",3.8,"Pours very dark brown with a tiny bubbled almost nitro head. Aroma is like a cup of fresh espresso with a hint o chocolate. There has to be an absolutely massive amount of coffe in this, as the flavor is huge. Really like it in combination with the not too heavy body.","Manhattan Beach, California, USA","Anova167"

174,"2012-03-11",3.5,"On tap. Pours with a black hued body with a lasting tan head and some lace. Aromas are of coffee, roast, earth, asphalt, nutty and chocolate. Roasted grain character is mild. Clean fermentation wise, no hop aromas either. Flavors are roasty, nutty, coffee and earthy. A bit of a biscuity malt character as well. Coffee is there, but not as insane or vibrant as some other coffee porters out there (I guess this might be more balanced...or muted). Medium bubbles, fuller body.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
174,"2011-12-28",3.4,"Pours a very dark brown color with a finger of tan head.  Smells strongly of coffee, especially like espresso and coffee grounds.  A bit of roast, maybe some toffee sweetness.  The flavor is also rather intense on the coffee, but I suppose thats the point.  Lots of roasted coffee notes, a bit of coffee grounds, perhaps some roasted malt and dark chocolate, too.  Medium bodied with low to medium carbonation.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
