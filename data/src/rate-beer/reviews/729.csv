729,"2015-11-15",3.4,"Pours a clear, dark golden orange color with a 1.5 finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a lasting cap/ring. Good retention with streaks of soapy lacing coating the glass on the way down. 

Slightly earthy aroma with resinous hops and grassy pine along with a strong malt presence and a decent amount of spicy rye. Soily with wet earth, grass and pine needle followed by caramels malt, toffee, biscuit and subtle dark fruit. Rye begins to stand out as it warms with a peppery spice character. Three different hop varieties but the hop profile in the nose is sort of one dimensional and the malts begin to overpower the rye after a while. 

On the fuller end of medium body with a stronger rye presence than the nose hinted at. Spicy and peppery rye dominates the flavor up front but is quickly complimented by dry, earthy hop bitterness that lingers through the finish. Dry, sticky hops are very bitter with grass, pine needle and spruce tip flavor. As it warms, the malts become more prominent with caramel sweetness, toffee, dark fruit, bread and biscuit. The high ABV is well masked making this beer easier to drink than it should be. Complex and well balanced but the hops interfere with rye spiciness a bit too much for my preference. I would have preferred if it was heavier on the rye with a subtle earthy hop presence. Unfortunately it was the other way around. Still, this beer was interesting and an enjoyable drink. I havent been a big fan of the 2X Series but this one was decent.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

729,"2014-10-01",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 11-1-13-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a golden amber color with a one finger of white foamy head. The head has a great level of retention, fading over ~5 min and leaving a nice level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma has a big dose of rye and citrus hop. Along with these aromas are some pine and a grassy smell giving a more resinous aroma to the brew. Some other smells of a light caramel sweetness and a bit of an oaky/woody smell round out the aroma making for a nicely hopped rye smell overall.

 Taste  The taste begins with a bready flavor and a little bit of caramel sweetness. Rye flavors are present upfront, beginning more mild, but getting quite a bit more potent as the taste moves on. Hop flavors, quickly come to the tongue, being of an earthy and light citrus flavor. As the taste moves on the caramel loses some strength while the rye continues growing more potent. Like the sweetness and rye the hops transition as well with the citrus largely disappearing and the earthy growing stronger and being joined by some other hop flavors of a grassy and pine nature. The rye, grass, pine, and earth take the taste to its end, where a light amount of wood enters the taste with a bit of caramel returning to the tongue as well, leaving a slightly resinous hopped but still rather present and smooth rye flavor to linger on the tongue. 

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is average to slightly below average in terms of its creaminess and has a carbonation that is on the lower side. The thinner body isnt the best for the combination of rye and hop flavors but the lower carbonation is actually quite nice for the rye flavors of the brew really allowing them to stand out. 

 Overall  A quite tasty and easy drinking moderately hopped rye. At 8.1 % abv and being so easy drinking and enjoyable, this one is a bit dangerous but regardless is very nice overall.","","Darkmagus82"

729,"2014-08-01",3.2,"Reviewed from notes. 
This was poured into a pint glass. Why? Because its just a Rye beer. Lets not make this one out to be more than it has to be. 
The appearance was a nice hazy golden orange to yellow color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. There was a tad of light foamy lacing that trickled for the most part. 
The smell had some light Rye malt with just a tad of bitter citrus hoppiness in and out of a slight bearing of the flavors. 
The taste was sweet and bitter, not at the same time but still showing a nice sweet to bitter and yet ultimately still having a slight Rye flavoring here and there all around. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat smooth and subdued.

729,"2014-04-17",3.6,"Bottled 8/21/13. Poured 3/21/13... yeah, thats kinda old for my liking. $2.19 single bottle poured into a shaker pint.

Appearance: Aggressive pour gave a ""frothy"" (mm.. lovely word) white/sandy colored head. Very slight haze. Copper color.

Smell: Spicy hops and rye, but mostly rye. Maybe a little bit of caramel malt, but the rye dominates.

Taste/feel: Hm. Gotta assume its past its prime by a decent bit. Nice body with a slight carbonation. A slightly spicy sweet rye flavor. Then a caramel malt aftertaste. Somethings weird/off about this beer though. Maybe its the sweetness Im getting? Its a bit artificial or something. For some reason, a bit watery. Its hard for me to explain. Its definitely not bad, but it seems... light. 8% ABV isnt there in any way, so thats a good plus. The rye profile is nice, but its not completely coming together for me.

729,"2013-09-19",4.0,"Pours a classic amber orange color with a skinny head of off white foam that fell off fast to a thin cap and ring. A few loose bubbles hang around to greet all the streaming effervescence coming up from the bottom. Leaves sheets of wet lace to slide back down into the beer as you drink. Perfectly clear. 

Nose is sweet lemon rind and bold rye. Hops floral and a light sweet pine. Theres a kiss of orange peel and a light spice. The malt is sweet and light. Smells like a lemony sugar cookie. No alcohol on the nose. Light scent of fresh grass and you cant help but wonder if this a summer beer. Very simple straightforward nose. 

Greets the palate with a bold rye and a little spice. Hops are herbal and leave a nice moderate bitter. The lemon is so light and sweet and the malt is flowing and light as air. As it war,s the toasted grains come out a little more and add depth and body to the middle of the beer. The spice and the sweet lemon are perfect together as both are soft and graceful. Carbonation is moderate and the body of the beer is full but not heavy. Despite the higher abv there is only a gentle warming in the finish. 

At first you might think that the nose is not terribly complex and I dont think that is a bad thing. Lager yeast does its part to keep this beer tasting great and drinking smoothly. All the characteristics are light and together they combine for a crisp and refreshing rye beer that is flowing and boundless. its earthy from the malts but delicately, so that the quality is all around and that adds a nice dimension to the drink. It finishes dry but with the tartness of the citrus that has gone unnoticed up until now. It is so lightly sweet all over and then in the end a gentle bitter finish and a nice mouthwatering tartness. 

Southern Tier has made another terrific beer . Brisk, friendly and positively carefree.","New York, USA","pinkie"
729,"2013-09-18",3.9,"I poured a 12oz bottle into an official Southern Tier goblet. It was bottled on 8/31/13 and cost $3.15 ($0.25 per ounce).

Appearance: Beautiful copper hue, crystal clear body, plenty of visible carbonation. Forms an average sized, eggshell, foamy head which lace and retains well.

Smell: Dank hoppy aroma of pine and tropical fruit concentrate, plus strong rye bread character.

Taste: Im not usually a huge fan of rye-centric beers, so I approached Southern Tier 2XRye with some reservation. However, just a sip in I knew this beer wasnt nearly as rye-forward as its name suggested. Its actually better described as a West Coast style IPA with significant rye malt added. Well balanced and plenty flavorful, but isnt something Id consider especially unique. 

Much like the nose, the flavor begins with sweet tropical fruit notes. Not so much citrus as it is passion fruit, guava, mango, papaya, etc. A surge of dry bitterness at the apex of the swig followed by a significant bready flavor. Rye is of course the most predominant of the malty character - imparting some spiciness, but backed up by enough additional malt that its a little more complex and balanced than your average IPA. I think I even get a chocolaty note for a moment there. The finish is dry with mild spiciness, though the aftertaste is fairly clean. Its a nice change of pace on the usual extra or strong IPA style. Not quite hoppy enough for me to consider it a double or imperial brew, though I find the name a bit misleading (and, quite frankly, played - cmon guys, do we really need FIVE beers with ""2X"" in the name?).

Drinkability: I have mixed feelings on the delivery of Southern Tier 2XRye. On one hand its not a challenge to drink. The mouthfeel and body are medium to full with a crisp bite, smooth finish, and mostly clean aftertaste. On the other hand, the beer is a little overweight at 8.1% ABV, as it drinks more like a standard 6-ish percent IPA. I wasnt overwhelmed by one bottle, but I could definitely feel it. Its very tempting to have another, though.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
729,"2013-09-18",4.1,"Bottle. Floral, rye aroma. Slight amber, golden body with medium lasting head, nice lacing. Flavor begins sweet and malty followed by notes of rye, pine and hops with a bitter, lasting finish. A nice fall beer.","Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA","KornDogg"
729,"2013-09-17",3.6,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a clear copper color. There isnt much head - not even a fingers worth of white-shaded head - but whats there tries its best to retain well. Some lacing is left behind.

S: A good amount of rye malt on the nose, with just a kiss of sugar cookie sweetness. An herbal touch of hop bitterness blends beautifully with the rye aroma. Perhaps too well, though: its a bit one note aromatically.

T: This has a nice rye-forward nature. A pleasant spiciness opens the flavor profile nicely, with the earthier rye tones closing it well. All of this is accentuated by subtle hopping that provides a good flavor with low bitterness. Some of the fruity sweetness in the middle goes away once it warms up. This is exactly what I expected it to be, and thats a good thing.

M: Most rye beers seem to prick the tongue slightly, but this does a good job of retaining a smooth texture, partly thanks to restrained (if not low) carbonation. The finish isnt really that dry, so its not amazingly drinkable. Its not suffocatingly sweet either, so its not hard to drink, either. Basically, its about as drinkable as youd expect a good 8.1% brew to be.

O: If the whole modus operandi was to showcase the rye flavors first and foremost, Id definitely say they succeeded. While not the most complex, its definitely a very good rye ale, and one where I wouldnt have regretted picking up a 6-pack of this.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

729,"2013-09-11",3.4,"Pour is clear and pale, like an orange honey. Aromas are dry and spicy, some pine notes. Rye definitely dominates the taste of this one, not so much balanced as intensified with spicy, herbal hops. Finish is bitter fruit rind.

729,"2013-09-11",3.7,"Aroma is spicy rye and an undercurrent of other malts/mildly sweet bread. The flavor is citrus, spicy, mildly sweet/nutty malts, light grapefruit and a complex and dry/sour/bitter finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
729,"2013-09-09",3.6,"Bottle. Pours clear copper with a small white head that dissipates quick. The aroma has floral notes, peach, and earthy notes. The taste is light spicy rye but has a nice grapefruit and caramel balance. Good but could be more refreshing.","Spring City, Pennsylvania, USA","boxofrane"
729,"2013-09-08",3.9,"Very nice spicy rye aroma, pours a clear amber with a full white head. Quite a bit of hop presence that provide a punch of bitterness, that fades out letting the rye step forward. Long lingering rye finish, a very nice rye beer.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"
729,"2013-09-06",3.1,"This one pours an appealing looking copper body topped by a decent head. The aroma starts and ends with a crisp, but sticky, hop sweetness unmistakably accented by rye. Similarly, the body has a sweet stickyness to it accented strongly by rye. Altogether it feels a bit off-kilter, like it could find greatness if it just gathered its rhythm a half-step better and found more balanced footing.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
729,"2013-09-06",3.5,"From a bottle poured an amber color with a good amount of head. Nice bitter hoppy flavor with a quick finish.","Swedesboro, New Jersey, USA","jeremytoni"
729,"2013-09-04",4.0,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/21/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, tangerine, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, rye, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes with moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, pineapple, floral, grass, pine, rye, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, floral, grass, pine, rye, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial rye IPA. All around nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. Not as much rye flavor as I was expecting; but this was still a very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
729,"2013-09-01",3.7,"12 ounce bottle, DOB 08/21/13. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head that sticks around for a while. Theres also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like rye, pine and citrusy (tropical fruit, grapefruit) hops, and some bready malt. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also an earthy/herbal flavor noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. I think this is a solid brew, I liked it. $10.99 a 6-pack.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
729,"2013-09-01",3.6,"Bottle. Pour is clear orange, thin white head. Aroma is fresh rye bread, slight hops, spiciness. Taste is roasted rye, yeast, lemon and spice, some banana.","Minnesota, USA","djroehler"

729,"2013-08-06",3.8,"9oz from Yard House Cincinnati. Mostly clear amber color. Thin off-white head. Respectable lace. Bigger body. Kind of crisp, lighter carbonation. Lightly dry finish. Nice spicy, tingly rye malt character, and good spicy, lightly citrusy piney hop. Some toasty malt in the finish. Good moderate to bigger bitter taste, minimal sweet. Tasty rye IPA.
