3572,"2017-01-10",3.1,"Eerily saturated urine-amalgamated Luis lemon liquid, attained an adoringly faint daffodil, gym sock, well water minerality, and mild curry aroma liberated from the glass I poured it in.  Jumbled dried candied mangoes alongside sea salt and cat hair when left out to warm. Definitely bloggable, if nothing else. 
 Now, Im all for the creatively extracurricular specialties from microbreweries, but upon my first scan of the labels description, I must say that this beer did come off a tad sententious, pompous, and confusing. Stillwater arent Stone: they may have thousands of dollars to literally blow on whatever experimental batch of brew theyd like to create, but I always thought of them as brewing refined and thoroughly researched beers. Thankfully, this isnt stupefyingly bad or downright dumb - still my criticism remains. You only truly experience half of the things that actually go into this gose, which to say the least is a lot. Just but a hint of mild curry on the swallow: an inauthentic peppery zestiness that was so astoundingly mild it could have been attributed to pretty anything with some unspicy heat. Heck, even it could even be misinterpreted as cinnamon, which is bad in of itself because no Thai chili on this planet or any other would want to be confused with cinnamon. Simply not a reality Im comfortable living in. 
 Wheat grain gives a fuller, rounder performance throughout. 
 The lemongrass was but just a footnote on its mid-palate: the tiniest lemony tropical fruitiness tasted therein, but honestly it could have also been from a stale lemon-flavored Starburst. *Sigh*
 Heartburn central after all the flavors are washed down. Why do all these friggin Americanized sour wheat ales always have an overabundance of heartburn in their profiles? By no means bad, I just dont get this iteration or why this release was even the smallest amount necessary.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"

3572,"2016-08-17",4.0,"Bottle @ Mikes House. Slightly hazed straw colored beer with a white head. Nice lemongrass and tropical fruits. Plenty of lime, peach, mango, and tea. Nice tartness on the tongue and some lemon and lime juice. Dont really get a lot of the chili character, which is fine with me. Pretty solid beer.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3572,"2016-08-16",3.4,"Rens bottle. Im getting the heat and spice, not so much of the lemongrass and mango. Even the salt is not overwhelming.Strange aroma.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
3572,"2016-08-12",4.1,"Draft at Paradiso Dupont. Hazy straw color, big white head. Aroma of juicyfruit gum, lemon lime, tropical fruit. Taste is earthy, very fruity, subtle peppers. delicious.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3572,"2016-08-10",4.2,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours slightly hazy pale straw/yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big tart lemon, lime, passion fruit, peach, mango, pineapple, green apple, white grape, sea salt, wheat, cracker, straw, grass, light pepper/lacto funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, fruit/salt/spice, and light-moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart lemon, lime, passion fruit, peach, mango, pineapple, green apple, white grape, sea salt, wheat, cracker, straw, grass, light pepper/lacto funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Moderate fruity/acidic tartness and light pepper/yeast spiciness on the the finish; with lingering notes of tart lemon, lime, passion fruit, peach, mango, pineapple, green apple, white grape, sea salt, wheat, cracker, straw, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic compelxity, robustness, and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, fruit/salt/spice, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/tart/spiciness balance, and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from tart/spiciness as well. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderate crisp, fairly acidic/saline, and sticky/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.8%. Overall this is an outstanding gose! All around awesome compelxity, robustness, and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, fruit/salt/spice, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the balanced acidity. This was not as sour/funky as the normal Gose Gone Wild; but was extremely well balanced instead. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
3572,"2016-08-10",3.8,"Draft at Blind Tiger. Pours a bright, hazy golden body with thin white lacing. Nose is tart lime and nelson hop. Mouthfeel is light bodied and zippy with notes of tart limeade, sour citrus and lemon. Towards the finish you get more soft grains and chili peppers coming through.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
3572,"2016-08-10",3.7,"22 oz bottle from Party Source. Pours a clear light golden color with a small off white head and active carbonation. The aroma and flavor have pale wheat malts, tart citrus, salt, mineral character, some tropical fruit though I wouldnt necessarily say mango, a subtle hint of Thai chilies, my bottle seemed to have a Brett funk early, good.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
3572,"2016-08-09",3.7,"Bottle. pour is very pale yellow with a slight green hue and a large white head. Aroma is tart lacto along with faint fruit and light yogurt. not much lemongrass on nose. flavor is also tart lacto with light lemon and yogurt. maybe a touch of fruity sweetness but not much obvious mango. really not getting much lemongrass or chili but I like it anyway. Chili may be present very late in the back of throat but I may be imagining that. This really tastes a lot like original with just a little less tart and funk. still nice.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
3572,"2016-08-08",3.7,"Refrigerated brown bomber poured into a glass. Hazy bright yellow with small white head. Aroma is Brett, medium/light body, lower carbonation, and some small-bubble lacing. Taste is Brett, tart, some lemon, a little salt, and hints of peppers. Really easy to drink and the spice is in check for me.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
3572,"2016-08-05",3.7,"Ten-buck bomber from VE. Nose is huge orange peel with lemon, lemongrass, and earthy-topical, probably mango. Coriander? Has an amazing Saison herbal/spice nose, really bright. Pour is pale yellow, so clear and pale that Im thinking I can see green, with a large dish soap bright white head. Quite tart in the mouth but not bracingly sour, also not laden with lactic acid, really much smoother than that and without the chalk, though the body is thin. Little scratchy, a little fresh green, mild pineapple, some black pepper at the end, lovely lemongrass (though its pushing into wittish floor cleaner / lemon Pledge territory), all other fruit backed off and disappeared. Looking at the label, this beer claims Thai chilis, but there is absolutely no capsaicin heat here at all, not even vegetal or chili-fruit character. The summery wheat beer mouthfeel comes through with a hint of slime, along with pleasant drying; no real bitterness until the finish and stays away from anything resembling sugar. Clean with just a touch of wood / scratch that might hint at Brett. Not quite what was advertised, but enjoyable and insanely quaffable. [2016.08.05: 3.7]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

3572,"2016-08-02",4.0,"22 oz bottle poured into a tulip. Clear pale yellow with almost a finger of off-white head. Gets hazy on the second half of the bottle. Aromas of lemon lime citrus, herbs, some salt, subtle funk. Tastes of lemon lime citrus, touch of salt, some herbs and lemongrass, light tartness, light chili pepper flavor. Didnt notice any pepper heat though it came out subtly as the beer warmed up. Light body with a dry finish. Maybe not quite as good as the base beer but nice overall.Would have enjoyed a bit more chili pepper heat for a Thai themed beer.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"

3572,"2016-07-22",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 22, 2016 Nose is like salty feet. In a good way. Nice funk. Not as salty as the normal but the mango adds a nice sweetness. Just a hint of spice on the finish and ends pretty dry. Really nice overall.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","falco242"
3572,"2016-07-19",2.4,"Draught at Kings Head, 7/4/16.Hazy, copper-orange body is topped by a small, off-white head with low retention.Lots of lemongrass and other herbal/grassy notes in the nose is joined by the intense funk of the base beer. Some heavy lactic and touches of acetic character add tons of fruit and yogurt quality with that strong cheesey character and less of the lighter, headier, more dry/tart brett of the base beer. Perhaps thats all the adjunct combining to mask the brett. Some salinity, light caramel even and no alcohol or flaw.Unfortunately, the flavor is even more given to the adjuncts, the lower, somewhat loose carbonation not helping to clear the palate of it, as it builds up to rather fatiguing levels. Salt, sweet mango and somewhat astringent herb/spice notes with mushy-sweet malts and lots of saltiness. Not particularly pleasant to drink, with non of the charm/finesse of the base beer. Where are the strong but delicate brett notes and intensely juicy-tart tropical fruit notes?? Everythings sort of jumbled together here very sloppily.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3572,"2016-07-18",3.7,"22 oz. bottle. Cloudy, pale yellow, with a big, rocky, white head. The aroma is lemonade, coconut water, oyster crackers, faint celery, and dry grass. Semi-sweet flavor, with a light, crisp tartness, and a hint of bitterness that dries out the finish. There is a subtle spicy warmth that grows the more you drink. Light body, crisp, effervescent, and a bit astringent. This is a good gose. The aroma is subdued, although the flavor is perfectly balanced and delicious.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"
