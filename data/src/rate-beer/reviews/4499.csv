4499,"2017-06-10",3.1,"65 cl bottle @ Timo As Flip-top Tasting. 2016 vintage. BBE 30.11.2016 (Importer sticker).
Pours dark mahogany color with a small head. Aroma is resinous hoppy, caramel, malts, dried fruits, distant vanilla. Flavor is dried malty, some wooden whisky notes, some leather, quite sweet. Slight contamination here, probably some age at work too, too sweet and harsh metallic, some sour sharpness. A bit disappointing.

4499,"2013-04-01",3.5,"Bottle from South Bay Liquor: Poured a deep shade of amber hue with a frothy layer of foam head on top. Aroma brings up scents of roasted yet sweet like malts that suggest hints of toffee and caramel along with heavy whiffs of imitation maple syrup. The drink is bright with traditional eisbock flavors regarding the sweetness of the malts and the dryness in the finish. Also, the sweet presence of malts is really what holds the structure of this style and the malts used here meet the grade. This is decent considering it was California made.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

4499,"2013-02-28",3.1,"22 oz bottle purchased at Roadrunner in Meyers, CA. I enjoy bocks, but this was my first Eisbock experience, so my rating may not reflect what should be expected for the style. Poured a nice mahogany-red color, with no head to speak of. Aroma is primarily sweet, with some rich maltiness and possibly a hint of german yeast hanging around. Taste: sweet, like the nose, beginning to end, not tremendously unique in character. The balance in the flavor is likely from the alcohol content, although the high gravity is well-disguised. There is also a faint tinge of something tangy and bright - perhaps from the yeast, which, aside from the sweetness, is the main component of the flavor profile. The malts seem more apparent in the nose. While not as cloying as some other sweet 10% beers, and certainly less than most barleywines, its just sticky enough on the palate to slow you down after not long. Overall, fairly smooth, reasonably tasty, but a little too overarchingly sweet and not enough other character to make me want to buy another bottle.","California, USA","fezzy"

Again, strong diacetyl in the middle.  Continues with a sweet, sugary character throughout.  Ethanol is hidden well, though.  A very sweet, cloying beer, which has some diacetyl flaws.
