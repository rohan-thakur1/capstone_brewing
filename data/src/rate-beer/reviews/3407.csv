3407,"2016-02-15",3.6,"A steady pour produces a one-finger thick, dark amber / tan colored head. The beer is a rich brown color that shows a clear, deep ruby hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells tart, a little bit like vinegar, a soft tart cherry character, a toasted oak note that contributes a nutty note and accentuates a dark malty note. There is a definite sherry-like oxidation here, that also accentuates the nutty note in the nose, and the cherry character becomes a touch more noticeable as the beer warms up.

Tart up front, and even more mouth puckering as it moves towards the finish, there is also an earthy, woody oak character in the finish that adds some structure to the body with its tannins. Up front there is a soft, sweet (really more suggested than actually sweet) cherry character, while the middle has an earthy, tart, bright cherry note that at times can meld into the tartness of the base beer as there is very little / no residual sweetness in this beer. There is a oral-nasal, floral cherry note that hits the palate if you breath in while taking a sip. There is a soft nuttiness here, and a touch of dry sherry, both from a soft oxidation / aged malt character.

This beer is quite sour, which is certainly nice if you like that sort of thing; luckily I do. It could use a touch more malty depth to it, but I like that the cherry character is not overwhelming, but still noticeable. A nice beer that certainly hits the spot if you are in for something quite sour.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3407,"2015-08-04",3.4,"Pours a plum pulp, murky brown color, with a fizzy beige head, leaving the beer immediately after a refreshing hiss. Leads to a gloomy, flat impression, while it is absolutely impossible to look through the glass.

Utmost cherry defined nose, in all its desirable facetts. Very pronounced on a ripe, sunbathed impression, revealing moldy cherry stone pits, accompanied by a supporting fermented fruit sweetness, adding a vinous note. Most likely the most fruit defined awa I have had so far, with a very intriguing ripeness as for the aroma defining cherries.

Drinks almost without any carbonation at all, while its pungent sourness makes up for that, guiding the flavors through the palate, by adding a slick acetic acid profile.

Cherries evolve from leathery, old earth and an uncompromising tartness, lending the beer its balancing sweetness. While this ripeness on the nose has been beautifully pronounced, tastewise it plays a role of required balance for the otherwise omnipotent sourness. The consequential interplay of those two flavors appears quite appealing, providing an unripe fruit beginning, which turns riper, as the malts exhibit more and more earth supported sweetness. Finishes with a long lasting dryness, accompanied by dextrose and grain bread, wrapped up by slick acidity.

While not outstandingly refreshing, as for its fuller body, the beer showcases a beautifully arranged cherry taste throughout. Its nice to see the cherry aging on your tongue after the swallow, which I called Jerry btw. Although the taste exhibits an intense sourness, it remains focussed on the cherries, revealing a natural fruit impression.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3407,"2015-04-24",4.6,"Served in a Teku from bottle.

Aroma  complex, inviting scents reminiscent of oak barrels. I cannot smell a lot of cherries in the aroma, but that may just be me.

Appearance  light brown appearance w/ fleeting head retention. Typical Flemish Red appearance.

Taste  marvelous Flemish Red in many respects--sour cherries linger in the back of throat w/ magnificent barrel finish, which expands across entire taste spectrum, leaving you salivating for more. Tongue is loving this one.

Palate  impressive how this brew makes you squint after each sip it. It is that sour. If you breathe out as you drink the beer, you can significantly realize the cherry profile, which makes this Flemish Red a top-tier contender in this category.

Overall  an impressive Flemish Red that I would buy again. It is not the best Flemish Red I have encountered, but it is definitely a contender and not a brew you should sleep on. Extremely satisfied.","The Garden of the Beer Gods, North Carolina, USA","TheGoldenChalice"

3407,"2015-03-29",3.8,"2013. The beer is a dark brownish red color. A bit too dark to gauge the clarity. Reluctant head but a vigorous pour got a few fizzy fingers of brown bubbles. Dissipates to nothing after a bit. Medium vinegar in the aroma. Light toasty sugar, dark fruit and wood. A fairly juicy sour cherry character. Nice Flemish red character without the off maltiness of some examples. The taste is medium-strong sour, solid tart fruitiness and light malt sweetness. Less cherries but theyre still present. Good bit of acidity. Mild caramel. Some other dark stone fruit fruitiness. While this is a definite step up from the regular version of Oude Tart, its still a bit harsh for my taste, though I probably have some bias against the style. Oaky finish. Solid pucker.

3407,"2014-02-17",4.1,"750ml bottle from a trade via BA. Thanks! Pours a deep oaky brownish hue, sun tea and reddish copper glow from the edges and bottom strikes a nice note in the light. Lively carbonation shows a light brownish head atop that dies to a mellow film, laces small down from a large cakey layer. Aromas are tart and acidic, nice lactic notes meet firm red wine, cherry skin, tannic oak and vinegar, sharp and potent with some nice cherry skin, red wine, large potent bite on the nose. Some balsamic, gentle biscuit and toastsiness beneath. Initial is lighter end of the fold, a potent cherry and lactic zing up front is sour and inviting, lactic yogurt, some red wine. The acedic qualities the nose seemed to indicate dont really come on, making this sour but not harsh or vinegar driven like I expected. The middle shows some more cherry, red wine, big lactic kick reallyt sustains. Yogurt, vanillin, and cherryskin. Lemon and citric elements, a bit biscuity and toasty, bready malts show through just a bit in the middle. Still, some decent fuzziness, carbonation, and lactic elements make this light and sour, to the point. The cherries seem to step the game up compared to the already wonderfully done base Oude Tart. A bit juicy, firmly lactic, and a bit slick as we turn the corner, some gentle oakiness, biscuit, faint Balsamic elements. That toasty/biscuity touch isnt bad and lets you know there is some depth back there. This is more sour than the more fruity and luscious regular Oude Tart, but I really do dig it. Where the nose seems to promise a more intensive, abrasive sour, the beer itself is potent, but lays off any vinegar, a strength of regular Oude Tart as well. Tasty stuff. As a fan of Oude Tart though as it is, its hard not to like this a lot too.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Bottle: The aroma consists of cherries, cola, light vinegar, oak, and a hint of lemon. It pours cloudy orangish-brown with a small beige head that quickly fades to a thin ring.

3407,"2012-03-27",4.1,"Served on-tap at the 2011 bruery RS initiation party into a taster glass. Glad I got a sample of this early.

A - Pours deep brown with a small head leaving little to no lacing down the glass. Nothing special really.

S - Similar to supplication. Tart cherries, oak, vanilla sweetness mix well with a lightly toasted malt center. Pretty good but it kind of works against itself.

T - Quite a bit of sour cherries up front with a moderate amount of lingering acidity. Plenty of chunky cherry flavor adds a touch of sweetness. Some vanilla and oak come thru once the acidity dye down. One of the best beers at the party. Very nice stuff.

M - Good body with a lingering tart cherrie feel. The carbonation was a little low but it worked in its favor I think. Pretty good.

D - I am glad I got a sample of this. It could have used a bit more cherries but it was still pretty good. I hope they end up bottling it at some point. I would love to have a few.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

3407,"2011-05-10",3.9,"In short: A very nice tart/acidic cherry beer.
How: Tap at at Extreme Beer Fest 2011
The look: Muddy light burgundy body topped by a beige ring of foam
In long: Nose is mostly sour cherries and some acidic note, not funky or anything.  Taste is has a lot of sour cherries, a bit of caramel, vinegar notes, sourness and acidity level is medium, no funk or anything wild, almost no tannins presence.  Body was unfortunately a bit lifeless.  With a more lively body this would have been a kick-ass tart cherry beer.  This was a nice exclusivity at EBF.  EBF tickets at expensive, but a gym subscription is a lot more expensive so I just go to beer festivals to feel better about my body.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3407,"2011-04-24",3.9,"On tap at Extreme Beer Fest 2011. One of the first beers I had, and then came back right away. 

Pours a rusty reddish-brown color with a short off-white head that stays around pretty well with a good swirl or two. A bit of lacing. The nose is quite nice. It had been awhile since Id had Oude Tart, but I recognized the base right away. Nice tartness with some cream and dark fruits plus a mild acetic presence. Good lactic presence there as well, then layered with some fresh, tart cherries. Great complexity in the nose. 

The flavor wasnt quite as complex are integrated as the nose, and it was a tad bit more acid-forward without as much of the underlying cherry, oak, and fruit flavors. Still, quite good. The feel integrated the two acid components quite well and mixed things up really well with the cherries. Overall, a very nice beer that I was thrilled to see on the menu.

Serving type: on-tap

Complex mix of sweet fruit ( orange, plum, lemon) with a healthy backbone of yummy sour cherries. Really good  balance of tartness vs. sweetness.

3407,"2011-01-10",4.3,"On tap at the Bruery Reserve Initiation party 2011. Pours a murky rust mahagony color with a slight tan head that collars around the glass. Nice tart cherry aroma in the nose along with slight acetone. Light mouthfeel. Well balanced comes to mind as I drink this. It really isnt overly sweet or sour but somewhere in the middle with the sweetness of the cherries being counteracted by the tartness and vice versa. Ends with a lingering tartness. Very drinkable.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"

3407,"2010-11-30",4.0,"A: The pour is a murky dark reddish-brown color with a minimal khaki colored head forming.

S: Lots of sour cherry notes right off the bat, as I hoped for. A bit more vinegar than I recall the regular Oude Tart having. Lots of vinous red wine notes as well.

T: This one is quite sour with a moderate amount of acetic acid. Plenty of cherry flavor both in terms of the flesh and skins as well as oak, wine, and just at touch of sweetness.

M: The body is medium with a moderate carbonation, dry finish, and quite puckering overall.

D: Probably the best beer of the event/afternoon. The addition of cherries seemed like a natural addition to this beer, and they certainly were.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3407,"2010-11-29",4.1,"Had this on tap at The Bruery under the ""Thanksgiving leftovers"" section.  Was amazed to show up and see this, Cherry Chocolate Rain, -bal aged Coton, and Sour Rugbrod with lingonberries all on tap.  Mega score.  I couldnt help but get shitfaced in front of my fiancees teetotaling parents.  Thats life I guess.  This beer pours a hazy deep cherry red color with little head to speak of.  Not the best appearance, but for this beer it works.  The aroma is excellent, slightly acetic and tart with big cherry notes and some spices.  Not too nose-burning.  The flavor is excellent, almost off-the-charts.  Nice malty character, with slight caramel, red berries, and a slight hint of vinegar.  Huge, huge sweet and sour cherries on the finish.  Like almost Wisconsin Belgian Red magnitude cherry flavor.  Theres also a great tartness to it, bretty and lactic.  Nice acidic palate with low carbonation and a spicy and sour tingling to it, which I really liked.  This is the best wild ale Ive ever had from The Bruery.  They really nailed it.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

Very bright fruit on the aroma. Flavors are of ripe black cherries, red wine, a touch of sweetness, some spice and bright fruit. It doesnt seem that the cherries spent a long enough time with the bugs for the sugars to be fully consumed. Personally I prefer the bottle conditioned Oude Tart over this version.
