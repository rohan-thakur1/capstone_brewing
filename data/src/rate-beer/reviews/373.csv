Seems earthy and vegetal, not in a bad way, but kind of reminds me of something Mort Subite-like. Definite malt undertones showing a fair amount of honey-like character. No alcohol or flaw.Very unique and interesting flavors in the mouth give way to honey and very light caramel. The more it warms and breathes, the sweeter it gets, until finally I really have no interest in continuing to drink it. Fruity, funky, lightly acetic and oaky, with a light brett signature.

Aroma is nice with hints of citrus and pineapple. Some light stone fruit notes with apricot and cherry. Some light wood and oak notes. A bit of an earthy, herbal note that is a touch grassy. 
Pours a somewhat hazy, bright golden color with a medium sized, moderately thick, white head that recedes somewhat quickly to the edges where it lingers in clumps for a bit before disappearing. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor is moderately acidic and slightly sharp. Light citrusy lemon notes with a touch of pineapple. Some moderate under ripe nectarine and apricots notes. Light oak and hints of oak tannins. Light grassy and hay notes with a bit of an herbal, earthy note. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice sour with god complexity but it is lacking the funk that makes lambic a lambic. Nice fruit notes from the yeast, but the acidity is a touch off from the oak tannins.

Notes of lemon, leather, hay, oak, rhubarb, a touch of green apple and a rennet/cheese character that dissipated fairly quickly after opening. Flavor is moderately sour with citrus character nicely rounded by underlying notes of aprium, green olive, and more rhubarb. Not doughy or clumsy. Dusty, funky, and nicely balanced acidity. Easily one of the best domestic gueuze attempts Ive had. Bravo.","Portland, Oregon, USA","dionysus"
373,"2016-01-09",3.7,"Cloudy golden orange with a one-finger bright white head and minimal lace. Aromas of citrus fruits, oak and a touch of vanilla. Taste is sour apple and citrus, oak, earth and hints of yeast. Light body, moderate carbonation, prickly mouthfeel and a crisp finish.","Pacific Palisades, California, USA","RedSox2004"
373,"2016-01-05",2.9,"Pours a golden orange color with a funky fruit aroma. Barnyard, hay, and funky apricot flavor. Taste is weirdly spicy and acidic. A dry aftertaste that leaves a grassy lingering bitterness.","Diamond Bar, California, USA","Barreras"
373,"2016-01-02",4.3,"Cloudy yellow with a white head. Aroma contains some lemons, vinegar, and funk. The flavor is really sour with some straight up sucking on lemons. Really good for a US Lambic. Overall great.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
