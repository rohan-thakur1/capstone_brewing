4438,"2016-08-30",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
This bubbly lambic develops oranges and plums in a starkly funky and acidic setting.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the hazy orange.
-Funk levels are pretty high, which decreases drinkability for me.
-High effervescence works well with the fruitiness.
-Wet haystacks are apparent throughout.
-This isnt as refined as their Gueuze.
-Like this one a tad more than their regular Quetsche, but still not worth the extra expense compared their Gueuze, imho.

Smells of a wet hay accompanied tart fruitiness of young plums. A pleasant tartness mingles into a ripe fruit fermented quality, supported by funk driven citrus zest.

Has a lower carbonation, while the beer still turns out to be quite refreshing, as for its high fruit tartness, which almost numbes the tongue.

Tastes of sour citrus peel and dusty malts, revealing a leathery, sweeter note, once mingled together with the plum pulp quality of the beer. Its sourness is there from the beginning, while beautifully complimenting the fruit, showcasing plums which start in a very early, sour stage, slowly evolving riper, juicier and sweeter qualities, which gets added a flowery earthiness during the finish.

Quite soft and mellow already for only 10 months of age. Juicy, with tons of funky barnyard and no sharp, alcoholic or acetic notes to be found.Torched prune is very unique in the flavor. I guess its a combination of the plum notes and intensely phenolic funk character. Its borderline smokey, but the palate adjusts rather quickly and it slowly becomes more of a very dry, sharp balsamic-meets-fig-jam character. Heavy sulfur and biting acidity on the finish. Oh yeah, this is not fucking around. Approaching bone dry, with acidity/tartness sticking to the lips after every sip. Phew, this is intense, powerful stuff.

Palate is aggressively sour and lactic in nature, much more than the normal Quetsche or indeed any other Tilquin Ive tried. Lemon and yogurt to the fore, some plum in the back but its rather overwhelmed by the lacto. Some fruity character is present, tart berry or pit fruit but not obviously plum. Soft fruit skins in the finish, sulphur, horse blanket. Kind of greenish wood notes on the finish, which is very dry and rather puckering with its post acidic bite. Medium bodied with very soft carb. This isnt bad but the palate is a hair too acidic for my taste.

4438,"2015-07-22",4.3,"How: Bottle (750 ml) at tasting. Shared by AdamChandler, thanks! 

>>> On the same level as the ""regular"" Oude Quetsche. A superior fruit lambic where, even when fresh and super fruity, the lambic character is quite present. 

+  Nose is really fruity, but unlike other fresh fruit lambics (Kriek, Raspberry, Apricots), it doesnt hide the horse blanket and funky character from the lambic 
+  The acidity level is moderate and fits perfectly with the fruit 
+  The lemony character from Tilquin lambics is present as usual and reminds a bit of Cantillon lambics 
+  The moderate acidity level combined to the good balance, pinpoint carbonation and the dry finish gives a really drinkable and quenching product 
+  It definitely has a fun winey character 
○  With the two versions of the Oude Quetsche and the Mûre, Tilquin is developing a really nice portfolio of fruit lambics with fruits that arent used by other Belgian lambic producers.

4438,"2015-07-18",4.3,"Special edition of Tilquin Oude Quetsche made with only Altesse plums, a blue plum variety grown around Namur, apparently. Medium thick but loosely structured and collapsing, yet retaining off-white head, colour is a warm, misty, pinkish and orangey peach. Nice, elegant and refreshing lambic funkiness in the nose with the plums already apparent at a first sniff; it seems they play a bigger part in this one than in the regular version. I get plum stones and wet wood, plum flesh (even reminiscent of unripe peaches), dry sherry, damp hay, strawberry, cava, unsweetened yoghurt, goat cheese, a hint of lime juice and of course the expected Brett horseblanket odours. Taste starts with a very tangy acidity, a stinging trace of raspberry vinegar and lemon juice, then softened by a sweetish stonefruit presence, though I would not be able to determine if these are plums or something else in a blind tasting; the plum mixes beautifully with the lambic esters, rich and elegant. There is a mellow lactic yoghurt tartness as well, a soft deep wheatiness and a touch of bready malts, before tannins begin to dominate the finish, a combined effort of wood and plum stones (and plum peel, I suppose); the lemony acidity pops up again and rounds things off with a tangy, sharp sourness in the back. The bottle is only half a year old, I reckon this gains even more nobility as it gets older, but this is already a splendid fruit lambic as it is: a soft, malse lambic character with still spritzy lemon acidity going through it, and all the time you can feel the presence of both plum flesh or juice and plum stones, completely melted in the lambic. This was the case in the regular version as well, but I strongly get the feeling that the plums in this one are more pronounced. Whatever the case, they shine beautifully in this one, this is doubtlessly another world class Belgian lambic.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Elle est à la fois orangée et rosée. Une teinte qui rappelle tant la prune que la pêche ou labricot. Trouble, les énormes bulles qui firent leur apparition lors du service sestompèrent rapidement pour céder la place à une fine couche crémeuse. Très étonnant! Cest la bière dont le spectre olfactif sapparente le plus à un vin rosé sec que je connaisse. Cest à sy méprendre. La prune, ainsi ajoutée à une importante source dacidité, peur facilement passer pour du raisin avec en prime, du bois comme trame de fond. Le portrait est vineux mais sec puisquil sagit dune gueuze après tout. Acidité modérée, le tout est léger et délicat, à limage dune gueuze ayant quelques années en réserve.
