2847,"2017-05-31",3.2,"Not a bad pilsner, grassy and floral with a nice bready undertone and plenty of lager esters. Starts semisweet with a hint of tart lemon and green apple, then grows a dry middle, yeast mixing with cereal grain, leading to a fancy Noble hop finish. Not the prettiest brew--decent color with little head or lace--and the aromas a bit blah, but the feels nice and sparkly. Can see this beer being useful when loading up a cooler for the beach.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"
2847,"2017-05-27",3.7,"This is legit. Its bright golden with a foamy head. It has a really nice floral noble hop character to its nose with a hint of Cheerios smelling malt. This is just a hair sweet is my main complaint but this is at least partially made up for by a solid smack of earthy bitterness in the finish. Really nice and drinkable overall, good beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
2847,"2017-05-25",3.5,"DATE: May 25, 2017... OCCASION: Cavs/Celtics Game 5--get in and get out with a win!... GLASSWARE: Penn State pilsner... pours a clear-as-crystal light golden body with copious amounts of bubbles... surprisingly, the off-white dissipates into a murky muddle and variable coral lacing... an aromatic lemon-citrus hit pleasantly introduces flowers and a light, buttery biscuit... secondary hints of subtle spice--pepper, mainly), lively, biting hoppiness early, with a dry release... fruitiness (apple, pear), crisp lemon and sweet biscuit... a refreshing beer whose profile is solid, maybe greater than the sum of its parts... not outstanding, but a nice case mate for the Overpackd I bought last week...","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"
2847,"2017-05-23",3.3,"12 oz can into a footed pilsner glass, purchased at Plaza Liquor in KC. Clear golden appearance with a fluffy white head and active carbonation. Pleasant aroma of noble hops, bread, earth and toasted grains. Similar flavor, adding mild hop bitterness and a light malt sweetness. Light, clean and crisp with a slight dry finish. Solid Pilsner overall.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
2847,"2017-05-22",3.7,"Can from Shawan Liquors. Pours golden with a white head. Leaves a lot of lacing in the glass. Solid grass notes on the nose. Nice grassiness on the tongue. Crisp and clean with a hint of bitterness on the finish. Very quaffable.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
2847,"2017-05-20",3.2,"I like German style Pils, a nice refreshing hoppy drink. This was well done. Nose is sharp, vinegar? along with grassy and floral notes. Appearance is pale, clear, rapid carbonation, nice lacing. Taste is clean and lagered, nice body. Finishes dry.","Rochester, New York, USA","jb"
2847,"2017-04-24",3.9,"Light floral notes in the aroma, pours a crystal clear light straw with a full white head. Light bodied, with a touch of malt sweetness at the beginning, going to a crisp floral/spice hop finish. Very easy drinking, and a fantastic beer for warm weather.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"
2847,"2017-04-14",3.9,"12-ounce can pours bright, sparkling, clear yellow with visible carbonation rising, yet only a trace white head with no lacing. Aroma: grass, lemon, bread. Flavor: honey, hay, cereal, white pepper. Mouthfeel: light-bodied, prickly bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Very crisp and dry, refreshing. VERY drinkable.","Plattsburgh, New York, USA","shawnmurphy"
2847,"2017-03-29",3.1,"bottle at boston hotel room, post-ebf 2017. pours almost clear light gold with a small white cap offering some retention and lacing. lots of raisin/grapey maltiness, herbal-grassiness, noble aura, hint of honey sweetness, cardboard traces, very clean yeast action though. moderate carbonation, light body, relatively dry herbal finish. kind of weak and/or oldish pilsner - another one that looked great on paper.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
2847,"2017-03-10",3.8,"This one has all of the elements of a good German style Pils. Crackery, biscuity mouthfeel with dry lingering finish. Spicy hops. Good ones, too-- I like my Pils hops to be Teutonic, not Americanized. However, I notice something with this beer that I have with other US Pils: the consistency seems tricky. One time I get a super dry, tasty and superbly fresh beer that competes with most true German offerings, and other times I notice that awful oxidized off-note that seems so prevalent with craft-brewed lagers. Why cant brewers get this straightened out once and for all! Its like Pils and other lagers are too nuanced for American brewers-- and perhaps American consumers-- so they just dont put too much effort into figuring it out. Nonetheless, a pretty solid American Pils.","Rutland, Vermont, USA","canary dog"
2847,"2017-03-09",3.5,"Pours a clear pale golden with a medium white head that leaves nice lacing. Nose is a bit garbagey at first but after a moment it offers some pretty chill cereals and fruits. Taste is of toasted malt, multigrain bread and is moderately bitter. Medium body, medium carbonation. Pretty good but not the best craft pilsner of the night.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
2847,"2017-01-04",3.6,"Draft. Clear bright golden color, white head with delicate lacing. Cereal aroma with subtle pepper. Taste is peppery crackers, clean finish. Nice.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
2847,"2016-12-10",3.8,"Poured into pilsner glass, the appearance was a yellow gold color with a quickly dissipating white foamy head. Messy sticky foamy lacing running all along the glass.
The aroma has a clean sweet bready malt subsiding along a crisp sweet grassy hoppiness. Semi-bitter, here and there.
The flavor leans towards the bready/biscuity sweet malt. Hops are there still, like a grassy sweetness. Smooth bready malty aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a great sessionability about it. Low carbonation is felt. Smooth body.
Overall, nicely done malty sweet German pilsener that I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
2847,"2016-11-12",3.1,"12 ounce can from Beer Run. 7/21/16. Clear golden, thin fizzy white head, decent retention. Aroma of Noble hops and bready malt. The taste is white bread, grapefruit, grassy hops. Thin bodied, mild lingering bitterness, decent balance.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
2847,"2016-11-05",3.4,"6-pack of cans. Straw colored, good lacing. You can taste the hops, both for bitterness (really, just drying it out) and flavor. Earthy, spicy German hops. Nice malt backbone. Not an ""easy drinker"" for the BMC crowd. One of the better US pilsners.","Rochester, New York, USA","McGarnigle"
2847,"2016-09-02",3.6,"Can. Bright yellow, hazy, with a low, fine head. Lemon nose, herbal. Crisp, light malt flavor, crackers. light and lemony. Comes off very citrusy like US hops. Nice pils though.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
2847,"2016-08-17",3.0,"Canned on June 8, 2016. Pale yellow. Tiny-bubbled wisp of white foam. Reserved but defect-free lemony, airy, herbaceous and crackery nose. Underlying spruce and vegetal notes. Soft and snug carbonation. Thin in body. Vague snap of coarse minerals and equally shy herbal hops succumbs to a curious tartness up front. Soapy notes emerge and inhibit the otherwise clean fermentation, as does a malty coarseness which elicits thoughts of burnt wood. Subtle notes of elegant lemon are promptly neutralized by minor vegetal notes and spent tealeaves, although an elegant flower and lemon medley does persist. Indistinct malt flirts at papery and fails to impart much in the way of character or texture. Sprucelike and herbal whispers amplify the leanly crackery and dry finish, which is predominantly grassy and lacking in hop dynamism. A mostly clean yet very safe and neutral rendition. Swirl after swirl failed to reveal much aromatically, and overall there just isnt much else to excite. Timid hops and a perceivable tartness dont help the flavor much, and the incorporation of wheat perplexes me. A few minor adjustments could very well turn this into something solid, though. Ditching the wheat would be a good start, as would ramping up the bitterness and at least employing a single decoction to help the stark malt. Almost!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2847,"2016-08-11",4.0,"Can from Meditrina. Clear pale gold with white head and lace. Nice noble hop aroma, grassy and mild spicy with a hint of hay. Light on the crackery malt aroma that is usually part of the mix. Very light bready crackery grassy grainy sweetness with some grassy spicy malt in very dry finish. Very light body and lively carbo. I wouldnt exactly say it has a ""firm"" malt body. It seems significantly lighter than, say, Bitburger. But it is just what I needed today because its hotter than Shay Mitchell out there day. Excellent.","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
2847,"2016-08-08",3.7,"12oz can. Small white head atop clear pale straw body. Aroma is medium sweet, spicy, light bread, lemon, berry. Taste is medium sweet, spicy, light lemon, grass, bread, faint herbal. Light body, light chalkiness, very easy drinking.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2847,"2016-07-30",3.9,"Can exactly 1 month old into a pilsner.
A: Pours a big frothy head that falls fast. Clear pale straw yellow with very active bubbles.
S: Herbal hop notes with lemon and light wood.
T: Dry taste of plain white flour or crackers. Light hop bite of lemon pith and zest. Subtle flavors balanced very nicely.
M: Light, spritzy, clean and dry with lingering bitterness. Easy drinking is an understatement.
O: Best ST beer Ive had and one of my favorite new beers of the year. A must try!","Durham, North Carolina, USA","malvrich"
2847,"2016-07-28",4.1,"Golden color with a medium sized, white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of straw, some mineral, grass, and toast. Taste of cereal grains, toffee, light citrus and a grassy bitterness in the finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
2847,"2016-07-27",4.1,"Can DOB 6-30-16 (fresh!!) Pours a nice straw yellow with a lingering White head. Wow what a nice refreshing full bodied yet dry-finishing Pilsner . Definitely one of the best I have tried this summer . Totally refreshing, I could drink this forever . Highly recommended

2847,"2016-07-23",3.5,"Can. Clear gold hue. Light minerals, grass, and slight whit fruit note in the aroma. Bitter grass and minerals, touch of hay. Crackery and dry. Lighter to medium body.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"
2847,"2016-07-01",3.0,"Draft at source. Pours a bright, clear yellow with a thin sudsy white head. Aromas of grass, straw, cracker, hints of citrus. Flavor follows the nose and is pretty straight forward for the style. Light body, thin texture, bubbly carbonation, easy finish. Crisp. Light and easy-drinking, just not my favorite style.","Jamestown, New York, USA","bigda83"
2847,"2016-06-12",3.2,"Flight #3 at the brewery with ebone1988. The pour is a clear darker golden yellow with a lack of head and a few spots of lace. The aroma is almost nonexistent. Very pilsner-ish. The malts are very light and almost not detectable. Its got a light metallic offering that really hammers the style home. The flavor matches. Its a little more prominent on the metallic malt, but its thin and light with a nice metallic sweetness that is very pilsner based. The mouth feel is thin and watery with a light carbonation and a lingering metallic malt through the end. Definitely a pilsner, but its not bad.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
2847,"2016-04-29",3.6,"On tap at Schatzis. Pours a rather clear gold with a medium sized white head. Soft grain on the nose, crackers. Sweet fruity yeast. Medium bodied, soft grain, light cracker bitterness. Crisp and easy. Nice and clean.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
2847,"2016-04-12",5.0,"Very easy drinking pilsner, Id put it in the same bucket as a prima or pivo pils. Hoppy with a crisp finish, well done.","New York, USA","Tobyrando"
