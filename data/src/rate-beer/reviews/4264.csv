4264,"2017-06-18",3.3,"Can - pours gold white head - nose and taste of bready malt, like fruity hops and grassy notes - medium body",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
4264,"2016-10-31",3.4,"Can purchased from Clinton Deli on 45th and 10th. Pours a super hazy body. Nose is candied malt and crisp bitter character. Mouthfeel is clean with notes of honey, fresh hop and sweet fruity malt. Interesting Nelson-like hop profile faded in the back. The overall sweetness suggests the cans a bit past its prime, so Id love to try this fresh.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
4264,"2016-09-06",3.9,"Can. Cloudy, brilliant gold with medium, fine head. Huge hoppy nose, lots and of citrus: grapefuit and lemon, light, bready malt. Very lovely hop flavor with nice crackery malt background. Crisp, rather high carbonation. Lovely beer, but not a helles by any possible definition. Basically an IPA. Damn good one, though.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
4264,"2016-08-31",3.1,"16oz can. Pours a pale golden with a white head. Best description I can come up with is that its a watered down IPA with basic hop notes yet watery. I am a big fan of JA and Hoponius in particular but this one doesnt really do it for me.",", Massachusetts, USA","BroSpud"
4264,"2016-08-24",3.6,"Can. Poured golden with small head. Aroma is lightly herbal, bready, lightly grassy, and what seems to me to be honey. Super smooth. Lightly sweet. Very smooth and easy. This was a great beer for a hot day!","Rochester, New York, USA","Ron"
4264,"2016-08-21",3.9,"16 ounce can. Pours an almost clear pale gold with a nice white head. Aroma of tropical, citrus, floral, and malt. Taste is oranges, mango, melons, floral, and malt. Excellent.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
4264,"2016-08-13",3.8,"Can from Berts
Just shy of clear a light golden color with a huge bubbly white head that slowly recedes. Spicy floral hops on the nose with less malt that I was expecting. Rich bready maltiness but its not dominant. Plenty of earthy spicy hop flavor with low hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is a little light, but theres a solid mashup of flavors in a fairly quaffable beer.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
4264,"2016-08-12",3.9,"Great taste hints of light citrus and mango. A lite hop. Great initial head that dissipates quickly. Fizzy and fresh great summer beer. Really great Helles style German Lager. Hazy yellow and doughy. Nice job by jacks Abby and New England brewery - really good!

4264,"2016-08-11",4.4,"Pours an orange/amber from a can, thick head initially dissipates somewhat quickly leaving a white ring, some lingering foam and minimal lacing. Big and nice mango, orange and what I vaguely recall as pot aroma. Maybe now I would say like a dank bunch of basil, without that herbal sweetness, just the muskiness of rich smelling plants. Flavor is the same, a big hit of hops, not like any helles Ive had, nor like what I would expect one to be. However, the hops sort of melt into the smooth, mellow malt, not like an American Pale Ale where they sort of occur together. Very very smooth and drinkable, kind of the best of both worlds if youre into hops and malty beers--this might bridge some gaps and make converts of people who have strong feelings one way or the other. Very good beer.","East Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA","Quick3Beers"
4264,"2016-08-04",3.8,"Can. Thanks Devin!

Bright yellow body with a thin, white head. Huge mango and tropical melon aroma. Super fruity with some classic helles flavor sneaking in late. Definitely not a classic helles. More of a fruity, hop forward American / helles hybrid. Tasty.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
4264,"2016-07-30",3.5,"From the 16 oz. can. I am a fan of both Jacks Abby and New England Brewing. The pour is a slightly hazy yellow color with a small white head. The aroma brings out a nice toasted bread and biscuit presence with a low hop profile. Maybe grassy hops. The body is light to medium. The taste is clean, crisp, with a sweet toasted malt presence and a mild hop finish. This fits the bill for the style.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
4264,"2016-07-26",3.6,"Big can. Looks golden with a white head. Aroma of floral and fruity hops, some pale malts, and light dough/bread. Flavor the same with a nice light maltiness and a pleasant hoppiness thats not too strong. Average texture. A pretty good beer, but just not the most interesting style.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
4264,"2016-07-24",3.3,"Tap at the source. Pours light yellow, minimal ring of white head. Aroma is sort of peat Moss dank, that must be the Nelson, caramel. Flavor is bready, caramel, light citrus hops. Its fine.","New York, USA","SG111"
4264,"2016-07-23",3.9,"Pours slightly hazed straw into a shaker. Bright white head with good retention recedes leaving spider lacing. Musty white grape and tropical fruit aromas. Soft with grape skin, mango and passion fruit upfront turning to dry earthy caramel in the lasting finish. Nice.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
4264,"2016-07-23",3.6,"16oz can from CBC. Pours copper with an off white head. Aroma and is big tropical fruit hops, white grape, grass. Flavor is soft, tropical fruit white grape, grass. Not at all to style, but a good flavor.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
4264,"2016-07-23",3.6,"16 oz. can thanks to Willrunforbeer! Aroma is bright and full of hops. Mosaic and a New Zealand hop varies without a question. The hop flavor carries on into the base of the beer. The grass and scallion is pretty large. No bitterness with a very low yeast element. This doesnt feel like a German beer at all but.. It is pretty tasty. Lots of hop character.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
4264,"2016-07-23",4.1,"16oz can drunk 7/23/16.Light white head tops a clear, golden body. Medium to low retention.Smells like mosaic, but I guess its Nelson. Do get that white wine and it smells absolutely amazing. Wonderfully well-done hoppiness atop a very sparse malt that is completely out of the picture. The white wine and gooseberry is just awesome and right up there with the best.In the mouth there is a bit of cracker, pepper, and tons of white wine. Vinous, with green grapes, gooseberry and light crackery malts. Low carbonation but quite engaging. No alcohol or flaw. So I got pretty up-in-arms about them calling this a helles, which it certainly is not. But I get the beer-geek part, adding New England pale ale hop characteristics to it. It is softly malty and well-attenuated, and certainly has the maltiness of a double decocted lager. But just call this shit Beer Geek Lager or something.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

4264,"2016-07-23",3.3,"From a can, a light yellow gold. it smells great. The aroma is great. Not sure this is a Helles. its juicy, tropical, grapes. decent malt backbone, light, sweet some german yeast, tropical fruit everywhere.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

4264,"2016-07-20",3.9,"Draft at release party at Haymaker. Pretty golden pour. Nose is grainy and hint of hops. Tastes of grains, light pine and lemon, grassy, light spice. Smooth palate. Dry as a bone. After the DIPA figured this is a good palate reset and a lovely beer in its own right if you like a good lager which I do.","New York, USA","Jow"
