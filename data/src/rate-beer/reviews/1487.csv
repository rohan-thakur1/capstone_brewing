Close to being a pitch black beer. 
Aroma is nuts, caramel, light coffee, vanilla, white chocolate and smokeyness (in the smoked porter kind of way). Slight hint of oak and liquorice at the very back. Don¬ít know but like in the ""Lemon Meringue"", they manage to really capture that ice cream scent.
Taste is nuts, vanilla, roasted coffee and chocolate with a slightly minty aftertaste. 
Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Pretty thick for a porter. A small bitterness kick to the palate initially, which then dissappears quite quickly. No carbonation. Lingering vanilla ice cream taste.

Syrupy caramel, nuts are if anything less well defined than in the aroma. If the vanilla¬ís any good it has no room on the palate to show it. Bitterness throbs up dully.

Heavy aroma of malts, caramel, chocolate, mocha, tiramisu, roasted malts and coffee.

Appearance:

Opaque dark brown/black beer with a slight/medium dark brown.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, chocolate, mocha and tiramisu; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts and coffee.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. The start is amazingly sweet with loads of different flavours. No distinct nuts noticeable, but they sure help. Great coffee finish, but the beer could have been thicker.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Nose is sweet, milky and with a hint of cacao. Overall the nose is reminiscent of chocolate wafer. Some praline pecans in the nose. Beignets. But the overwhelming aroma is that of chocolate wafer biscuits.

Mouthfeel is full and almost syrupy. Palate has deeply roasted malt with the light charcoal and burnt twigs. Palate has preserved stone fruit with plum preserves, date jam and a very light hint of umami. There are also the usual predictable palate descriptions of burnt sugar, southern pralines, There is some ume dryness but not a lot. It¬ís actually pretty sweet for a stout, with a nice plum, dark cherry and cherry liquer and dark chocolate.

Finish is smoky, creamy, sweet.

Dark caramel, sugar and cream, milk chocolate, chocolate sauce, vanilla extract, pecans, some bitter coffee and nuts slightly compensate for the sweet rush, lightly alcoholic, but still sweet and sugary long into the aftertaste.
