4166,"2017-06-01",4.6,"Given their relative rarity in Nebraska, Im still fairly new to La Trappes offerings, but everything Ive tried from them has been incredibly smooth. La Trappes Bockbier is beyond drinkable, and thats worth noting - bock is the German word for strong, after all. This brew pours dark brown with a cream-colored head. Rich and somewhat fruity aromatics. Toast, molasses, fig, plum, and apricot. Flavor profile showcases brown sugar, caramel, toffee, and subtle chocolate and succulent fruit. Theres some touches of warmth and syrupy starch but nothing that makes you take a pause. The rich flavors indicate this is a sipper, but the smoothness tells your palate something else. I polished this off in no time flat.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

4166,"2017-04-21",4.1,"Appearance - dark, reddish brown with a pretty white head.

Aroma & Taste - nutty, caramel. Not too sweet, though, not like those caramel fudge bars, but actual homemade caramel that just has that perfect balance of the nutty brown buttery notes and juust the right amount of toasted sugar. It does have a solid bitterness in both taste and after-taste, but to me that is absolutely perfect when the majority of bockbier is just *so* sweet. It gives it a very direct character. 

Palate - medium body, good carbonation. Nothing to complain about.

Overall - my favorite Bock to date. If like me you like your bocks (or beers in general) to be less on the sweet side and more on the bitter side, this ones for you.","","teddybearontap"

4166,"2017-02-08",3.3,"Gekocht bij Dranken Maes in Dendermonde op 10-10-2016. En geproefd op 28-1-2017. La Trappe - Bockbier is een kastanje-kleurig tot donker-bruin en helder biertje. Bij het uitschenken krijg je veel amber-beige kleurig schuim met een dik wollige structuur dat stabiel blijft tot je begint te drinken. Het blijft ook sterk aan het glas kleven. Als je dan begint te proeven en dus ook het schuim aanraakt blijft er tamelijk vlug slechts een dun en fijn gelijkmatig laagje over. Toch kan je met enige moeite een middelmatige CO2 verzadiging zien met middelmatig grootte belletjes. Het aroma van La Trappe - Bockbier is vooral moutig, karamel en koffie inbegrepen. Ook in de verte iets wat op noten lijkt. De smaak is vooral zoetig en dan wat bitterig, zoethout en gebrande koffiemout komen ook voorbij. In de mond geeft La Trappe - Bockbier toch niet helemaal een volle smaak, het hangt ergens tussen vol en medium volmondigheid. Verder is hij wat bitterdroog en kwa textuur gaat hij wat richting waterig. La Trappe - Bockbier is normaal kwa CO2 prikkeling maar door de direkte bitterheid in de nasmaak heeft La Trappe - Bockbier toch een samentrekkend totaalgevoel in de mond. De nasmaak vloeit uit en is direkt bitter, daarna ook een klein beetje zoetig. 3.3, nog een goede score, vooral dankzij de gebrande koffiemout en het zoethout in de smaak.","Dendermonde, BELGIUM","RudiGR"

Taste follows nose with an overall sweet entry that delves into bubble gum, sour cherry and chocolate all at once. The overall effect unfortunately seems more artificial than natural and is worsened as we slide into a flat chemical toxicity that permeates through the finish and leaves an, uh, disagreeable impression. Palate is on the light side of medium. This feels like a worthwhile stab at the best of German and Begian styles.

4166,"2014-09-29",3.9,"33cl bottle. Aroma of a decent monk beer. Every time I open La Trappe, I think that the brewery is located in Belgium. Pours dark, cloudy, brown with thick, creamy head. Thick, malty beer, with aroma of nuts, raisins, oak and cellar yeasts. It does have a sweet undertone, not so typical for bock beers. This is a good example of full bodied beer - it is velvety and thick. Carbonation is extremely fine, and stays in beer till the last drop. Not readily available, so if you see a bottle - give it a try.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Senka"
4166,"2014-09-27",3.5,"Pours a good-looking, clear, deep copper body with a large, creamy, tan head that is both long-lived and able to stick to the glass. Malty, sweet and fairly strong aroma of dark dried fruits, Belgian yeast, sweet caramel and hints of anise. The strong flavour are dominated by caramel and burnt sugar, the Belgian yeast is pleasantly present, and in the back the dark dried fruits including raisins are accompanying slightly warming notes of alcohol. The taste is moderate sweet and the long finish is moderate bitter. Pleasant mouthfeel, its mid-bodied and has an oily and quite smooth texture and a moderate carbonation. Another nice ale from these productive monks.

synthétique, extrêmement difficile et lent à ouvrir.
En dehors du mérite de sortir cette bière, on ne sait pas très bien où des trappistes ont pu 
prendre la recette... du bouc...
Couleur brun foncé assez joli, roux en transparence, et noir quand elle est exposée au soleil couchant.
Clarté nette. Bulles par milliers partout très vives.
Mousse beige moyen bien épaisse.
Arômes très restrictifs de pain bis et caramel.
1ère bouche souple sur des céréales (il y en a 3 dans la composition : orge, froment et avoine),
un rien de café et du chocolat noir.
Arrière-bouche avec une amertume sans distinction.
2ème sur de lavoine grillée, herbe à chat.
3ème un peu plus levurée, pointe de noisettes.
Arrière-bouche toujours très faible, juste torréfiée.
La longueur donne de plus jolis nez que les bouches, ces nez sont avec une douce levure.
Les bouches sont assez étroites ou « pincées », avec une amertume toujours banale.
La levure est très jolie au nez sur la longueur, on la dit, et au goût un peu limite, mais cest 
pour léquivalent dune double, donc on ne peut trop demander.
Lalcool est pauvre, mais comme on est devant une 75 cl, il arrive à chauffer un peu la finale.
Cette finale est un peu plus intégrée que le reste, mais pas plus complexe.
CONCLUSION : une bière brune qui sapparente plus à une double industrielle, qui titrerait vers
6 % abv, à lexception des nez de la longueur qui présentent de jolies senteurs levurées très 
agréables. Mais si on prend une bouteille de 75 cl bouchonnée, ce nest pas pour quelques nez

4166,"2012-12-22",3.0,"In short: A roasty juicy brown ale lacking personality.  Just ok.
How: Bottle 330ml, consumed a few months after receiving it from private importation.
The look: Brown body topped by a medium beige head with medium retention.
In long: Nose is very roasted, estery, a bit phenolic, toasted fruit cake.  Taste is roasted grainy cereals, dark and red berries, brown sugar cookies, some caramel, yeast, peanut shells, earthy notes, nougat, tobacco, ginger-like spiciness. A rather juidy body with sparse bubbles.  Nothing wrong with the list of flavor elements, however when all put together it was missing something.  Muted, dark, unexpressive.  Not a bad beer, just very forgettable.  I rarely like a beer from La Trappe, not sure what my problem is with this brewery.

Malts and yeast esters vie for your smell senses with the malts easily winning. Add a hand full of crushed dark, red berries and a spoon full of all spice and youve got the aroma.

Untill now this is the best bock beer Ive tried this year. Those monks really know what theyre doing.
This is the only Trappist bock beer and the only bock beer that continues to ferment slightly in the bottle, at least according to their website.
Small bottle of 300 ml. Ingredients arewater, barley, wheat and oat malts, yeast and aromatic hops. Some yeast can be found in the bottle of course.
Pours a very dark ruby coloured beer, with a huge beige head of 3-4 fingers in height, thick and creamy, with excellent retention. Heavy lacing around the glass as the foam is going down, but never away. A thin layer of foam persists around the glass, while a big chunk of it lingers on the centre of the beers surface. Shake your glass a bit and another thin line of foam appears again, with almost the same sustainable retention.
A fantastic aroma on the nose from the hops. Light caramel , alcohol, some apricot, plums and other dark fruits.
Taste is great too. Sort of sweet at first but with a definitely bitter aftertaste. Caramel, coffee and dark bitter chocolate flavours.
Medium thickness on the body and average carbonation.Quite dry on the palate, with this dryness helping the bitter taste to stay longer in the outh.
As I wrote before, this is the best bock beer Ive tasted this far. I will surely get some more to drink during the cold days of autumn plus another couple to keep in my cellar.","Arnhem, NETHERLANDS","Christos"

Starts with gentle hops and nice caramelled malts, also toasty and nutty, slows down into a nice burnt, smoky malt flavour with a lovely bitterness which surprises you. A nice but subtle hop note stays in the mouth in the long run.

Bottle brown, 750 ml
Appearance:  Pours red to slightly deep violet body colour, typical for a Dunkler Bock beer, carbonation of body is medium, body is clear in texture, head is initially medium to big with no lacing, slowly decreasing to the minimal, off - white, cappuccino like, beige in colour.
Aroma: Plum, prune, brown sugar, light sweetness, sweet fruity but mild aroma, alcohol is well hidden, very mild flowery hoppyness, typical Dunkler Bock aroma, some Munich malts and gentle malty sweetness.
Flavour: Very interesting especially due to fact that it feels almost like a very light seassion beer in terms of alcohol content but its 7%abv! Amazing, very easy going and drinkable, some notes of malty grains, sesaonal grains, surprisingly not sweet as the aroma would suggest, plum, roasted grains, very mild bitterness, not that complex. Finish duration is medium to long, a bit too flat finish I think. Reminding Dunkel bottom fermented beer in the aftertaste, quite regular.
Palate: Body is medium, alcohol is perfectly hidden, texture is wattery. Finish feel is neutral, a bit dull, neither hints of fruits nor bitterness.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

Shes thrilled and gushing about which ""treatment"" to have first while I speculate about the resorts policy on guests smuggling in beer. It would sure liven up the meditation sessions. Okay, two drinking days left, so lets get into this: La Trappe Bockbier is a handsome sonofabitch, a sparkling clear ruby-brown with a funnel of bubbles shooting from the base of the glass as if from an undersea vent. The tan head was so tall and enduring that I should have poured yesterday. It exhudes thick vinous fumes of Mirin, Christmas pudding, bubblegum, grout, shiraz and licorice. Its raw and rooty, and dominated by dark malt. Medium bodied and softly carbonated for a creamy-smooth mouthfeel. But theres nothing smooth about the flavour mix, which is down and dirty: licorice root, oak, clove, leather saddle, pepper... Its an aggressive mix with strong Christmas spice overtones. Very robust in flavour for its 7%abv. It didnt seem entirely integrated to me, but its always a pleasure to sample something as bold as this. Nice work, fellas.

4166,"2006-02-03",4.2,"As the Trappist brewers carefully toil amongst vats of fermenting ale, this one seems an oddity amongst the giants and yet is easily a cut above many. This was a fantastic bock, and first of the bottom fermenters, showing a little of the Dutch and, dare I say it, German influence. Honestly had the meaty consistency of a German Doppelbock along the monastic lines of Weltenburger or Andechs. Tasted from the bottle, sadly the only one I had, and poured into a shallow chalice. Deep hazy brown body with a tinge of ruby coming through in the lights. Crowned off by an amazingly dense, creamy lather of tannish foam that left a little legs. Rich and unrelenting, concentrated malt nose; bitingly spicy and reminiscent of fresh baked Xmas pudding with a zest of savoury fruits, doughy yeast and thick layers of chocolaty malts. Chewy, smooth well rounded body in the mouth; lightly spritzy carbonation tickled the front of the tongue whilst the back end had the viscosity of a fine port. A wonderful blend of strong malt and fruitcake flavours, peppery spices and zesty dried fruits and citric peels coat the mouth with a strength that belies its modest ABV. A light, earthy hop note came in late offering a meld of malt and hop bitterness before a long malty rich and lipsmackingly chocolaty swallow. Excellent balance of complex malt flavours have resulted in a wonderful Bock. One to try again. Lovely!!! (30cL, BBE 03/07, Intl Beer Shop, W. Leederville)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"
