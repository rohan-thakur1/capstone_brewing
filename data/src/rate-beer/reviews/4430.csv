The aroma is surprisingly funky. There is a good fruit skin to it, but the tartness really isnt there. Its strong on the funk, per the usual for Cantillon. The flavor is fantastic. Its like tart cherry pie filling. There is a light funk, but the tart cherries are huge. The skin is nice, and there is a solid oak to it as well. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a bright carbonation with a lingeringly tart cherry with a bit of funk. I like this a lot!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

A ridiculous amount of cherry character in the best way possible. Yes, there is sweetness but it is in perfect balance with the acidity unlike some other beers with this much cherry character. I appreciate that this is a variable thing but I think I had it in its most perfect form. On this night, I just couldnt imagine another beverage in the world that I wanted to drink as much as this.

Palate is quite bitingly sour with sour cherry flesh and lemon juice. More and more richness from the flesh builds to the finish, cherry skin too, reasonably woody, very restrained musty funk. A slight leafiness to the otherwise dry woody finish with acidity. Creamy medium full palate.

The flavor takes it up a notch. Sweet and sour cherries. So fresh and delicious. Just teeming with cherries and cherry juice. Amazing.

A: Dark ruby red body. Large pinkish head consisting of millions of tightly packed bubbles. Slowly cascaded leaving behind film like lacing.
S: Massive cherry blast. Sweet, sour and tart. A little bit of musty oak.
T: Like the nose the cherries here are incredibly dynamic with sweet, sour and tart notes sharing the stage. Oak is here as well as a light musty funk. 
M: Velvety with medium carbonation. Refreshingly clean. Nice tantalizing sourness in the finish.
O: A very nice kriek which truly shows off all the cherries that were packed into this one. Unlike the lou pepe kriek which is quite juice like, this one has a little bit more of a zip to it that is quite nice.
Monks Cuvee Version (6 glasses consumed over a week at Monks... Im greedy.)
A: Deep blood red. The clarity varied between the glasses that I had. Earlier glasses had some clarity, but they became increasingly less transparent. Very thin pinkish skim. Quickly recedes, minimal lacing.
S: Dank sour cherries and a bit of funky oak. Nowhere near as complex as what was to come... 
T: Amazingly cherries, bold tartness, sharp acidity, and a nice little puckering. Also present is a dash of citric notes, funk, leather, and oak. Very assertive, but not overwhelming.
M: Low, but not non-existent carbonation. Velvety on the tongue. Medium-light bodied. Immensely refreshing. Wish I had a cask of it in my house to pour myself 4 oz before heading to work every morning.
O: The different Cantillon krieks serve different purposes.  The regular is mind melting sour, the lou pepe is bright and juicy, and this, like the Cuvee Moeder kriek, is packed with complexity.  Sad that this one might not be around for a while.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

4430,"2010-08-23",4.2,"Rating 600! On tap at the Moeder café in Brussels, same story, this is Cantillon Kriek with a slightly different recipe an only available on tap at their cafés. Aroma is a very smart mix of cherry flavour and lambic. The appearance is a nice deep burgundy red, just like wine, but then theres this fluffy pink head on top. The taste is an almost perfect mix of deep cherry flavours and lambic sourness, many different levels of both can be tasted sip after sip. In my opinion its a better recipe than the original Cantillon kriek, and this shines with its great balance between cherry and lambic flavours.","Alberta, CANADA","DeanF"
4430,"2010-08-19",3.8,"2010-08-09. Very dark red body, good sized frothy pink head. Aroma seems stronger than the regular kriek, soft rich cherries with a brief hint of feet, and sour cherry pie. 7+ Flavour is quite sour at first, before a stronger cherry flavour emerges. Less sour as it goes on, but still spikes and grabs at the cheeks occasionally. Hints at leather, but not really. Cherry skins. 7+ Smooth average plus palate feels more full bodied than its bottled cousin. Very good and very well made but the overall impression is not entirely to my own tastes.

4430,"2010-07-31",4.9,"Handpump at Moeder Lambic. The fellow that coaxed this from the cask informed me that its a slightly different recipe than the bottled kriek, there being more cherries in this version.

And right he was. A three dimensional cherry flavor, tart and dry, fills the mouth. Its tempered with a miniscule amount of oak. Indescribable ecstasy.

They offer this by the glass or the ""cruchon,"" a 1L serving vessel. A tantalizing prospect, but I think its intended for multiple people. Plus Zwanze beckoned..","The Court of the Crimson King, California, USA","afrantzell"
4430,"2010-07-28",4.1,"Sampled on draft at Chez Moeder Lambic Fontainas; July 2010
The pitcher poured from the tap has a big, large bubbled, pink tinged head of foam to it and the color is a hazy, deep red hue.  The aroma of this beer is fantastically creamy smelling in its cherry character (if that makes any sense at all); buttery cherry notes, some cherry pie like character and just a really over-the-top cherry aroma push this into cherry overload.  This smells so sweet and cherry-full; the bad thing is that the cherry just completely dominates the aroma here, the good thing is that the cherry is so rich and complex in and of itself that it really works.

The taste is shockingly dry given the uber-fruit expectations one got from the aroma.  The beer is light bodied, but has lots of cherry skin tannins that add texture and fullness to this beer (though it is also likely that the oak contributes to this texture).  The beer has a light spiciness to it, has a huge tartness and an aromatic cherry flavor.  The fruit definitely plays a big role in this beer, it is way bigger than any bottled version that I have had from Cantillon and I wonder if that is because the Kriek has to be watered down with Lambic to kick-start the bottle conditioning.

The cherry character is just so huge throughout, but still this manages to be so dry, which the 3 Fonteinen Schaerbeekse Kriek does not fully manage.  The aroma has such a cherry explosive character that it is quite awesome how bone dry the flavor of this beer ends up being.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4430,"2010-05-28",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2010 NOTE: This rating is for the special CUVÉE MODER LAMBIC version.  Exclusive to both Moder Lambic locations.  I later confirmed with Cantillon brewer that it is like their Kriekenlambik except that they use a lot more cherries for this version, almost twice as much.
In short: A superb cherry beer with a mild funky and acidic edge
How: Hand-pumped Moeder Lambic Saint-Gilles and at Moeder Lambic Fontainas, Brussels Belgium.
The look: Dark red body topped by a large long-lasting pink head
In long: Strong nose of fresh cherries with only a tiny bit of funk.  This smells a lot more like a cherry fruit beer than a lambic cherry.  Taste is simple but how effective!  Lots and lots of fresh cherries with a mild dry acidic bite in the finish.  A bit of funk.  Maybe some grapes in there too.  Unlike most fruit cantillons the lambic is not the main attraction here.  They use so much cherries for this special Cuvée Moeder Lambic version that the beer is more like a cherry beer than a lambic-cherry.  With the difference that the lambic does make the beer dryer and a little acidic.  Probably my favourite cherry beer ever.  I like it as much as a fresh Lou Pepe Kriek.  I had the regular Kriekenlambik at Cantillon.  It is good but I much this version.  If you are hoping for a lambic-cherry you might be a bit disappointed but if you look at it as a cherry beer it is simply mind blowing.  What an unexpected surprise.  They say nice things always happen to those who least expect it.  Seems to be true.  Ive been expecting to get  beaten up in a dark alley.  For so many reasons.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Extreme complexity in sweetness, tartness and even mouthfeel.  Just a touch of sour, a touch of tart, a touch of sweetness and a touch of earthiness.  Smooth as can be, and super easy drinking.  This beer rocks.  The odd coconut flavors really make it special.   Reminds me of some kind of coconut, almond and cherry butter cookie.

All the tartness sits around the edges and forms a tunnel of love for all the elegant sweet wonderfulness to fall into.

Ok thats my first half gone. Off to the bar for round two... Stunning fruit, just stunning. Very little acidity. More lactic than anything.

There is a kiss of vanilla and a faint acetone character that accentuates, rather than dominates the fruit.  Soft funkiness on the back that picks up as you work your way through the glass.  Earthy, sour and intensely funky, but the sourness is quite muted, especially for Cantillon.  More lactic and soft than the typical citric Cantillon house character.  Musty/musky flavour toward the back finishing with a shot of acid.  This stuff is really complex and has a subtlety all its own.

The waitress warned us that the beer was flat and tasted like vinegar; it seemed she really didnt even want us to buy it. Fool! The pour was a gorgeous deep red, with the slightest touch of carbonation and head. The aroma was intoxicating, deeply funky, sweaty, horsy, sour, like a dead cherry tree growing in a sauna converted from a horse shed. Mmmm. Just begging to be drank. There was a touch of thinness and lack of complexity in the flavor, however the sourness and funk was deep and very enjoyable. Easy drinking, thick yet still light in body.

Pours a vibrant, bold, bold crimson-blood with pale rose finger. Flavor is rich, with a punchy mix of gueze and fruit. The flavor of the cherries isnt so much dominant, as lifting the tart, skin-like dryness of the gueze to a different level. The cask presentation, I find, disconcerting, however. It really dampens the desirable profile of the style. I miss the prickly, bursting, carbonation of a well conditioned fruit beer, and instead find the softness of the cask presentation doesnt meld well with tart, citric quality of the beer. Ends with a lightly sweet cherry-filling quality. All that being said, its still pretty freaking delicious.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

First, the lack of carbonation, which normally bothers me but actually created a nice, soft feel, probably due to the hand cask.  Next, there was a relatively low acidity level, allowing the fruit to shine in a well put-together, nuanced package.  Subtle and refreshing.

Aroma is of rediculously fresh cherry pulp, juice, and puree and low on the stone, almond and pitty character- light on the overall farmhouse funk as the cherry is dominant- has nice tart character in the nose though.  Flavor is fresh dark almost tart black cherries with lots of tannic skin and some hints of pit and cyanide.  Great sharp, yet not overpowering, lactic acidity which cuts through the big powerful cherry fruits.  Smooth as hell on the finish with a nice astringency, and good acidity.
