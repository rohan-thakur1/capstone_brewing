1250,"2016-04-16",3.9,"This was poured into a pilsener glass.
The appearance was a mostly dark brown color with a foamy rocky off white head that hangs around for a good minute and a half.
The smell takes on a ton of dark fruit, clingy to roasty to sweet bready/yeasty content rolling on into a sticky malt character.
The taste was moderately smooth and sweet with the sticky malt character bleeding nicely on into the entire flavor.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a fair sessionable to smooth sipping quality about it. Carbonation feels fairly light.
Overall, as a doppelbock, it definitely works, really nice!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1250,"2016-04-02",4.1,"Got in a BIF from tasterschoice62. 500 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly cloudy deep ruby red/brown color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, chocolate, cocoa, light coffee, raisin, plum, fig, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, dark fruit, and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, chocolate, cocoa, light coffee, raisin, plum, fig, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/spicy hop and roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, chocolate, cocoa, light coffee, raisin, plum, fig, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, dark fruit, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready, and fairly grainy/sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an excellent doppelbock style! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, dark fruit, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and easy to sip on for the ABV. This has very prominent roasted flavors of a Schwarzbier along with with the dryness; but still has balanced doppelbock malty/fruity complexity as well. A very enjoyable hybrid of the two styles.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

1250,"2015-05-12",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
This Doppelbocks bready lengths, surrounded by comfortable Munich malt, dwell in a refined and highly authentic presentation.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the gleaming copper-hued mahogany.
-Alcohol is a no show in the flavor profile.
-Drinkability is higher than most of this style. Residual sugar levels are low, as you can imagine.
-Munich malt and their accompanying residual sugars also create dark cherry connotations.

Piwo zakupione w Żywcu (kolejne :) ) z powodu rekomendacji na ratebeer. Oprócz tego zdobyło brązowy medal podczas tegorocznej edycji konkursu World Beer Cup w kategorii German Style Doppelbock.

In short: a sweet and roasty dark lager.
Pours quite clear dark amber-copper, with nice off white head, poor lacing. Roasty, liquorice, ripe fruit aromas. Medium body, average carbonation, some oily texture. Taste is caramel, roasty, liquorice, ripe fruit. Smooth and enjoyable, but not a classic doppelbock example.","Asturias, SPAIN","Lowenbrau"

1250,"2014-06-03",3.9,"I poured a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. There was no freshness date and it cost $5.49 ($0.32 per ounce).

Appearance: Beautiful strawberry-red hue; translucent with no visible carbonation. Pours to a large, tan, foamy head which dissipates and leaves no lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong cherry and other dark fruits; minor alcohol presence.

Taste: Jacks Abby is a new brewery whose niche is lagers. Whether the beers are traditional lager styles is a bit of a mystery. Though their beers do make a good case against the reliance on traditional styles with Saxonator Dunkles Dopplebock being a good example of what I mean. Theres definitely a lot of character to this beer that makes is reminiscent of some of the great German examples, though its still unique enough to blur style guidelines. Thats okay with me since the end result is a tasty beer.

The palate is an interesting hybrid of flavors found in styles of doppelbock, barleywine and American Strong Ale. Much like the aroma, dark cherry, raisin and fig are all quite prominent. I detect a hint of toffee or caramel, though its more of an afterthought. Mild bitterness on the finish with some faint chocolate flavor and a distinct alcohol presence as well. All the flavors here are quite pleasing, though Ive experienced similar palates that were even more robust. If this beer were rich and cloying it wouldnt be a flaw.

Drinkability: Jacks Abby Saxonator is one of those beers where its ABV works for it and against it simultaneously. For it in that the 9% ABV is well masked in the palate and the weight. Against it in that it doesnt seem to be completely efficient as it has the flavorfulness of something closer to 6%. However, the delivery process is nice with a calm, soft mouthfeel and smooth finish and a clean mouthfeel (a little too clean, actually).","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

1250,"2014-05-04",3.8,"Malt-forward aroma with a hefty alcohol base reminiscent of almond liquor. Well extracted, fairly complex malt profile with neutral yeast character, not even a sulphur note. Were playing with nut tonalities, multi-cereal toasted bread, rye-like, and a certain concentration of vanilla infused darkish fruits like raisins, all fairly focused and sticking together on the palate, yet leaving your tongue swiftly as alcohol dominates the finish and after-thoughts. Plenty of residual sugars or perhaps not so much, but the generous alcohol adds a sugary dash of its own. Fortunately, the tight small bubbles clean that up some and so do the polite, yet relatively efficient leafy, spicy background hops, hitting with a subtle bitterness just in time. I got a feeling Id have dug this more at 2% lighter, but it is generous malt extraction and thoroughly clean and pleasant.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Rich and rowdy malt shows itself off in a way thats frolicsome and fun. Caramel, bread, dark fruits, raisin, date and fig, a touch of brown sugar and a bit of soft faint chocolate and it even hints at nuts.

Light beige head is initially large and recedes slowly to cover.Bright, ripe berry notes in the nose speak to the melanoidins and plenty of caramel and raisin lurks underneath. Rich, freshly baked brown bread and graham cracker notes further diversify the maltiness while just a touch of spicy hops and light alcohol dry the finish slightly. Just a touch of light hazelnut in there as well. Rich and complex and malty. All the good things a doppelbock should be...Acidic and fruity at first, lip smackingly delicious, with prunes, currants, blackberries and plum brandy notes all whirling about the palate. Lightly sweet caramel and hazelnut coffee notes with sweet cream and hints of licorice. Tons going on here and all very clean and elegant. Malty and rich, but without any syrupy sweetness or wortiness. Very full-bodied and strong, so youre not going to confuse it with even something like Salvator and certainly not Celebrator (a full 2.3% abv lower). Still, I didnt find myself feeling the alcohol and the attenuation and tight carbonation keep it on the drinkable side for its size.
