Fake fondant cream sweetness, not my thing. Light. Oily. Very lively carbonation. Short finish. I couldnt finish it. The cream just built up and really put me off.","Addlestone, Surrey, ENGLAND","BeardedAvenger"

410,"2016-10-09",3.6,"6.5%ABV. Cream ale.

Poured out dark brown. 30ºSRM.

Nose has a thick funky sour cream aroma that could b construed to be cream corn, but this particular iteration is a little thick to be associated with an aroma as light and creamy as creamed corn. I get light sulfur, roasted acorns and light saddle leather. A little creamy finish.

Mouthfeel is waxy and a little oily. Palate is has a foundation of pale malt with some nice bready flavors, maybe bread dough. There is an aggressive bitter that is a little jarring at first, but then starts to make more sense as you continue to sip. Hops are a little spicy, bitter melon, sap, resin, grass with some earthy overtones of wet decaying leaves and forest floor. Cilantro and fennel come through progressively.

Finish is long with a lingering soapy bitter hanging around at the back of the throat. Usually when this happens, a Columbus hop or a similar varietal is in there.","SINGAPORE","drjoeng"
