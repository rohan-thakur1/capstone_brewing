3723,"2017-05-25",3.5,"On tap, Centennial Crafted Beer & Eatery, Chicago, with Gordon. Deep ruddy brown in colour, off white foam. Definitely leaning more towards an American amber than a traditional Irish red, thats not a bad thing. Some sweet caramel and toasty malts, assertive bitterness, spicy hop, clean yeast no diacetyl to speak of. A tasty brew.","Greater London, ENGLAND","JorgeLee"

3723,"2015-11-21",3.4,"The bomber I purchased exploded when opened. I spent about 5 minutes sucking foam until it settled down. Im sure that was an anomaly, but its what Ill remember about this one. Color is a murky reddish brown with lasting off-white head that leaves good lacing. Aroma is mostly caramel malts, rye bread and grass, with some fruit. Taste is slightly sweet with some noticeable pepper and a drier, satisfying finish. Body is light to medium with lively carbonation. Quite enjoyable once the explosion was over.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ccex"

3723,"2014-08-10",3.4,"On tap poured into a sampler glass. The aroma is big on roasted coffee, chocolate, and some citrus and grains. It pours a dark and clear, copper red / brown color retaining a medium-thick white ring. Theres a moderate amount of micro bubble lacing down the glass. The taste is a light bitter with a medium-high malty sweet. An above average carbonation goes down with a slick texture. The medium, malty body finishes with malty caramel, light grass, and some citrus and stone fruit (peaches?). The aftertaste is very light, and mostly clean.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

3723,"2013-09-10",3.4,"On tap at the Beer House in Yorktown Center, Lombard, IL., and shaker served showing a clear, walnut color, with a nice layer of fairly persistent, creamy, soft white head foam, and wavy cling to the lacing. The aroma was roasty, with a touch of smoke, nuttiness, and smooth malt. Medium bodied, with moderate carbonation, low hop bitterness, and a mild, smokey/ tanniny astringency, the flavor seemed to wash out a bit, and lose some of its character, but was still very quaffable. Styled more as a Brown Ale, imo.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
3723,"2013-04-05",2.9,"A decent red ale that rates more like a porter.  Pours dark red to almost brown. Strong alcohol contact and has a nice aroma.

3723,"2012-10-20",3.4,"Had on tap at the new Park Tavern in Rosemont. Served in a shaker pint.

A: Pours a semi dark brown color, a little darker than expected. A thin, off-white head forms on the pour and recedes a thin ring.

S: Toffee malts and slightly smoky. There isnt much in the hop department, but there is some subtle background grass.

T: Much like the nose. Heavy on the sweet caramel malts and roasted malts. Light green grass with a mild piny bitterness. The finish is sweet toffee with a hint of smoke.

M: Medium bodied with a medium carbonation level. Smooth and sweet on the finish. Pretty drinkable.

O: I would have like a little more hops a la Lagunitas Imperial Red, but this was still a solid take on the style. The malts are definitely the star of the show.

Serving type: on-tap

3723,"2012-04-27",3.5,"Nice foam, amber color, good lacing. Hoppy aroma. Taste is big hops. A little malt in the middle then more hops. Nice beer. Easy drinking.

3723,"2012-03-10",3.0,"Flight pour on tap at the brewpub (Mundelein, IL). Pours a gorgeous rich copper pour, fiery orange amber red edges with many hues. Firm haze, rich glow. A frothy whitish head sits atop with a firm film, laces average overall. Aromas are gentle toast and touches of mellow sweet caramel. Some biscuits, bread, and gentle floral and mellow earthy hops. A kiss of citrus, hitting with some mellow life. Initial is ligher bodied, the heavier end, if that makes sense. Crisp toast and biscuity malts, bread, gentle touches of soap and floral hops. Some wafts of citrus, mellow bitterness yet mellow sweetness. A drinkable Red without a real defining feature. Toastiness, carmelized malts, biscuits, bread into the middle with a gentle dry finish, the toast and mellow sweetness still giving some jabs in there. A solid Red, if not a bit forgettable. a more assertive hoppoing (although I get they were going for a more tame Irish Red here) would have won me over.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3723,"2012-02-14",2.9,"On tap at Firkin. Pours a clear amber with a tan head that dissipates to the edges and laces slightly. Aroma has notes of bread and sweet grains with a slight grassy notes.

3723,"2012-02-08",3.9,"Draft at Tighthead. Pours a deep glowing red with brown tints at the deepest point. Robust whitish head. Nose is a bit of a surprise, affording a lot of Goldings character. Toasty malts that are hiding behind the grassy hops. On tasting, really well balanced with a robust malt character. Drying roast on finish that is perfect. The hop flavor is very welcomed. Pretty phenomenal red ale.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

3723,"2012-01-27",4.0,"Really enjoyed this brew. Easy drinking, full bodied sweeter than I expected, but in a good way. Pours a rusty red with an off white head.  Nose and taste are of a nice mellow hop, sweet malts, caramel, a bit of hay in the middle. Im not usually a big Red Ale guy, but I could drink this beer all day. This will be my staple from Tighthead when seasonals are not available.","Long Lake, Illinois, USA","JoePeesie"
