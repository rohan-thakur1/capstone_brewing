In long: Nose is strong, yeasty, some phenols and with an overall sweet bakery sensation like a baklava.  Taste is sweet but a little less than the nose suggested.  Crisp pie crust, caramel, candied apples, light spicy notes, light sour apple notes, bakery, various light color fruits.

Looks classic in the glass (a de graal tulip) nice murky orange, glows around the edges, decent carbonation, but not over the top, lovely little fluffy white head about a 1mm high. As Ive said I have had this beer and many other TIj beers and what Ive noticed is that they are good beer makers but somewhat inconsistent. There spicing goes up and down, the sweet:hop ratio changes, and thats in the same beer 2 bottles of one batch etc. Dont get me wrong, these idiosyncrasies are what make micro-breweries what they are, but when it effects the quality of the beer thats when I become concerned. Anyway what Im trying to say is this isnt the worst version of the Paasij beer Ive had but its not the best either. Its very refreshing, it feels great on the palate, but the problem is with the spicing, it gives a slightly sour aroma, and tastes a little tart from this clove-like/cinnamon type spice thats in there and possibly a little to strong in this batch leading to a very slight imbalance in my opinion overall.

1868,"2005-03-05",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 25, 2006 Hazy golden beer, creamy white head. Slightly sweet taste, some fruits, vanilla and coriander. Creamy texture, and low carbonationlevel, makes it very easy to drink. Nice beer.
Bottled version, exp date March 02: Cloudy maize coloured beer with a large soapy white head. Aroma of wood, yoghurt and rotting maize. Very sour taste, lactic, nearly undrinkable: 7 4 3 2 4 20
Bottled version: exp date March 00. Clear foxy amber coloured beer, small white head. Sweet honeyish nose, caramel, malts. Sweet woody taste, heneyish, but salmiac in the background. IJ-ish sour. Taste is a bit weak but pleasant. Quite remarkable difference with the other old bottle. 8 4 7 3 14 36

1868,"2004-09-09",3.3,"Bottle. Quite a spicy, flowery aroma, yeasty, like a lot of their other beers, this is quite soft though, some peppery floral bitterness, also slightly acidic, shares the same sort of house character as other tIJ beers, quite nice.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
1868,"2004-04-25",3.6,"Bottled: Dark golden coloured. Off white lasting head. Fruits, spices and yeast in the nose. Quite pleasant. Taste is spicy, malty and fruity. Is rather thin in the end, but pleasant and easy drinkable.","Søborg, DENMARK","madsberg"
1868,"2004-04-16",3.8,"Nice name again if you considder the name of the brewery.
The color is cloudy yellow-orange, with a nice foamy head. The flavor is malty, and spicy. The use of coriander is well balanced in this beer. The malts are still traceable, the yeasts and hopps too. Although it's no springbok in my opinion it's a nice beer.","NETHERLANDS","dirkbreedveld"
1868,"2004-04-09",4.8,"In dutch Paas means ""Easter"" and Ij means ""egg"". I would consider this beer a saison if it where sour/tart and from Belgium, since it is not I would classify it as a ""Spring Seasonal"". Golden to yellow in color with a dense white head that lingers through the end of the glass. The flavor and mouthfeel are both very soft and mellow. There is an almost saline like silkiness. I detect a slight hint of lavendar in the aroma, however it could just be my imagination. At 7% abv, overall PaasIj is a wonderfully balanced beer that can be sipped and savoured all day long on a brisk spring afternoon.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fomentateur"
1868,"2003-10-21",4.1,"cloudy orange colour, fine head and a nice lacing, strong bread aroma, estery, spicy, light perfumy and sweeties-like, very creamy, full and bitter with a dry yeasty finish - I just love this brewery !","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"

1868,"2003-05-08",3.7,"Cloudy bronze/orange in colour with a head that stays til the end.  The body is caramel and fruit with spiciness.  Quite an amalgamation of a wheat beer and abbey strong ale.  I liked it.","Wigston, Leicestershire, ENGLAND","leaparsons"
1868,"2002-09-10",3.4,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2014 Malty, hoppy, flowery aroma. Butter, honey and a touch of soap. Very hoppy flavot with honey, butter and citrus. Just a bit tart. Long hopbitter finish. Absolutely delicious!

tasted 12 years later. Bottle. Deep golden color. Pleasant floral citric, slightly yeasty aroma. Malty sweet flavor floral with some confit tropical fruit. Slightly alcoholic. Good beer.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
1868,"2002-04-13",3.6,"Spicy seasonal beer. Has it at the brewery itself. I like it but it is not as good as Zatte. It is a little too hoppy.","Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","William"
1868,"2002-04-04",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 21, 2005 This Easter brew is one of the best Dutch beers Ive had, even if the style  isnt my definite favourite. Had it on tap in Amsterdam, very enjoyable indeed. Pleasant spicy aroma with hints of leather and wood, the yeast is not as dominant as with some other beers of this style. Some sweetness in flavour and aftertaste, but not too much. Apparently this is a ""you either like it or you dont""-beer.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"

1868,"2001-08-04",3.3,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2014 New rerate 2014: Tap @ cafe Derat, small sample. Almost clear golden color, medium head. Aroma of spicy yeast, some coriander, bit grainy malt, hint of bubblegum. Bit bitter, bit sweet. Refreshing blonde beer. My earlier ratings showed obvious signs of infection, which t IJ used to cope with a lot. Nowadays they have it under control a bit more. Ok brew.
Rerate: Copper color, short but lasting head. Aroma of sweet flowers, bit yeasty. Taste of sweet malts, butter, bubblegum. Remaining palate. Odd t IJ brew. 1.9
Original rating: The sourness is dominant in this beer. Like the label says (you probably cant read cos its dutch) luxury nature beer of high fermentation, in which luxurious i cant apply, but the naturebeer thing is way too dominant, and i just dont like it.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
1868,"2001-07-30",1.1,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2003 I tried this beer about two years ago and i thought it was terrible. However, as i found out my tastebuds do mature (i really like Flemish Sour Ales right now) i thought it was time to give this Paasij a second chance. Nevertheless, my rating remains unaltered. Very sweet and yeasty. There's a bit the same going on as in their IJndejaars brew, it's something i can't put my finger on but i really, really dislike it. I'll stick to drinking Struis, Zatte and Plzen.","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"
