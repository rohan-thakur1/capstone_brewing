244,"2015-08-09",2.1,"Eerste wat opvalt is de hopgeur, een knisperend fris geluid bij het inschenken: veelbelovend. Maar zodra ik een slok neem valt mij de afwezigheid van smaak op. Er zijn wat hoppige tonen, wat mout, hij is fris, maar de smaak verdwijnt na een paar seconden en er blijft de bekende grassige hopsmaak over. Te waterig, weinig tot geen body, tegenvaller.","NETHERLANDS","ZodiacM"

Fresh baked white bread, strawberry lemonade, lime, raw vegetables (salad even), bitter herbs. Light sweet with some sourness and dry bitter finish. Very strange mouthfeel, hard to describe, like very sour powdered candy. Medium bodied. Unusual but not bad.","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","Maakun"

244,"2013-12-12",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2013 Bottle shared by Dutchdrebus @ weekly tasting. Clear yellow orange color, medium sized white head that lasts for quite a while. Aroma has a lot more hops than one would expect. Tastes a lot more hoppy too! Quite a lot of hops and fruityness in both the aroma and the flavor. Not really a kolsch anymore, tastes more like an APA to me. Nevertheless, quite a nice beer.","Oirschot, THE NETHERLANDS, NETHERLANDS","Benzai"
244,"2013-08-21",3.6,"Bottle courtesy of Deanso. Poured a cloudy medium amber with a big frothy white head. The aroma is big grassy hop. The flavour is medium bitter with some hoppy, grassy, liqourice, fruity notes on the very complex, smooth and refreshing palate. I looked at the reviews before I opened this bottle and thought surely not. However, they were right. This is a great beer and so untypically Dutch! Keep up the good work.","Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA","jmgreenuk"
244,"2013-08-03",3.8,"Opening this bottle was a lot of fun, you saw the flakes of yeast spurt opwards. Took a while for it to bubble over, but I was on time. Awesome aroma, ugly cloudy beer but thats besides the point. Extremely weird beer, a Koelschpee-eh. The Cascade seems to get through the most with citrussy, pineapple like flavors. Guest brewed at the 7 Deugden, but the best beer ever to come through those doors.","Wilnis, NETHERLANDS","dutchbeerpages"
244,"2013-07-25",4.0,"Bottle. Pours brown-orange with a bit white head.Hazy! Greatly balanced brew with a heavy maltbase and just enough hops to lighten things up without taking over too much. Notes of red orange, chocolate and grape.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","hirigalzkar"
244,"2013-07-17",4.1,"Bottled, BB March 2014, I think bottled a year before. Large sample. Slight hazy golden color, medium off-white head, longlasting. Aroma has some grassy hop, grapefruit, hint of citrus, some sweetness from malts, slight grainy. Medium bitterness in taste, bit malty as well. Good bodied for a Kolsch. Not as crisp and dry perhaps, but much more flavor. So definitely not a classic Kolsch, but that can only be a good thing as most Kolsch are a bit boring. Great head retention, good carbonation. Nice balance between the malts and the hops. Very nice brew!","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
244,"2013-07-13",3.3,"Bottle. Pours hazy orange with a medium white head. Aroma is bread, herbal, hops and some of the amarillo coming through. Taste has quite some of the herbal hops with a quite bitter finish. Medium body and carbo.","NETHERLANDS","TheJvd"
