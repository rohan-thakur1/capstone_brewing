238,"2017-02-15",3.3,"Can in Seattle. From one of the generous boxes Chris has sent me. Soft white cap, proper pale yellow body with some rising bubbles. Cool sweet straw aroma. First impression is sweet and creamy, but a reasonable crispness comes in underneath. A touch of syrup sweetness with a nice dry, crisp bitterness. Grassy, pale fruit juice. Some banana and ester, which is strange. A bit brighter, with more tropical fruits, than I had expected. Certainly not traditional but it has some things going for it.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
238,"2016-09-26",3.4,"Slight grainy aroma, slightly hazy straw color with a white head. Very light bodied, and easy drinking. Theres a touch of sweetness, and grain, but without the hint of apple that is generally noticeable in a Kolsch. Overall, its a light easy drinking beer, thats easy approachable.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"

238,"2016-06-16",3.2,"12 oz. can from thebaldwizard. Thanks Joe! It pours a very pale, mostly clear yellow color with a small, creamy lasting head. The aroma jumps out with fresh baked bread, lemon and light herbal lemongrass notes. The flavor is pretty much the same with dense bready, lightly doughy malts. Hints of concrete and earthy, lemony hops are present, but not strong. The body is kind of full and bready/yeasty yet dry and well attenuated. Decent, but the concrete notes, full body and over lemony hops keep it from being super refreshing.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
238,"2016-04-30",3.0,"Really pale straw color out of the tap with a thin white head. Light toasted white bread nose with hints of lemon. Thin grainy taste with some bitter lemon citrus. Really not much here.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

Grainy corn base with a mild sweet malt finish. Hop profile is low and completly untraceable. For the still it is pretty good with a pleasing mouthfeel.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
238,"2015-11-30",3.6,"12oz can thanks to Jeff. Pours out a pale straw color topped with a white head. Nose is vegetable some honey and a little cereal malt. Taste is more of the vegetable some earthy tones and a light sweetness. Very drinkable.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
238,"2015-10-17",3.2,"on tap @ MadTree / Cincinnati OH --- Clear light amber color, white head cover, hanging streamers of lace. Aroma of light malt and hay.

238,"2015-07-21",3.8,"Canned 6/26/15 enjoyed 7/22/15 in a pint glass. 

Look - See through, even when cold. Pale yellow. Medium white head. Thick bubbles, light lacing. For the style, expected. My preference, no. 

Smell - Non-roasted malt. When stirred there is a faint sour aroma. Citrus. Not my ""smell"".

Taste - Very thin taste. A large part is grass. Faint citrus. Not my taste. 

Feel - I like the feel here. I would expect it to be overly carbonated but it is not. For the style, this is better than the normal. 

Overall - This is not my favorite MadTree brew. Far from it. Is it something to suggest to a wheat lover, yes. Is it something to suggest to one that still likes to drink Coors Light, yes. Is it something to suggest to a beer lover, no.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","madelfonatree"

238,"2014-12-23",3.7,"12 ounce can, canned on 11/03/2014 (date stamped on bottom of can). Served in a stange/Kölsch glass, the beer pours a gold color with about an inch white head that stuck around a while. Theres also a good amount of lacing. The aroma is nice, the brew smells like bready malt, grassy hops and some lemon/orange peel. Taste is similar to the aroma, but theres the addition of some honey and light floral hops. Mouthfeel/body is light, its crisp and its also easy and refreshing to drink. Id probably enjoy this more on a hot day, but it was in the 50s here today (which is nice for mid-December) so thats close enough for me. So far Im 3 for 3 with MadTree brews that Id like to try again. $1.67 a can at Grain and Grape.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

I found this on a trip to the Party Source. Being a new Madtree I could not pass it up. They have a reputation for solid beers and I always love supporting the local breweries when I can. A fine example of a kolsch would be the perfect lawn mower beer for those who can find it on the shelves.

Aroma / Appearance - A semitransparent base glows with a golden warmth. Crisp white head provides a refreshing presence. Lemons, crisp wheat, and grainy edges are on the simple side although what more do you expect from a basic session beer.

Flavor / Palate - Dry lemons, ginger ale, and light hops refresh the tongue. A mellow beer opens up as it hits the palate. A decent beer would be unremarkable for many people but this is a Kolsch from a city known for its German heritage. For that it is well worth buying a pack.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

238,"2014-05-01",3.2,"Can thanks to DrSilverworm. Hazy light orange pour with a very small head that fades quickly. Aromas are crackers, grass, and light lemons. Taste has a slight sweet bread taste up front with a light bitterness in the spicy finish. Lots of grass and crackers throughout. Thin body makes it come off a little watery. A nice Kolsch.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
238,"2014-04-10",3.9,"12oz can into a pint glass.

Pours a clear light gold with a one finger white head. The head fades somewhat quickly but leaves a thin cap of lacing on the beer.

Aroma is extremely bread with some very light floral and citrus notes from the hops. Overwhelmingly malty though.

The flavor has lots of malty goodness but it is not sweet and remains restrained. Light lemon and orange is present in the background along with a light bitterness. Mouthfeel has some body to it but is light enough to be refreshing.

Overall, a nicely done Kolsch style beer. The breadiness is wonderful and it is very refreshing. Good job.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

238,"2014-03-08",4.0,"Poured from the can into a can pint glass (I really need to get some more proper German glassware). Nose is kind of a corn sweetness, a little wet hop on the nose as well?

238,"2014-02-16",3.4,"From the can, six pack purchased at the Taproom. Some citrus on the nose but overall aroma is restrained. Grassiness. Light, crisp. Significant warm bread flavor. Finishes clear with more bitterness than the typical Kolsch. Great beer for that one guy that comes to your house wanting Miller Lite (which is no longer in my fridge) and as a break from heavier, hoppier, brews. Another solid offering form the beards at MadTree.","","Kurball"
