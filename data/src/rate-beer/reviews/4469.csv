4469,"2016-09-10",3.1,"Bottle thanks to fatknitty. Pours quite deep chestnut brown, small tan head, decent residual and lacing. Aroma is, well, infected rum. Hmmm. Flavor is fairly tart, malty, medium funk, rum notes. Medium body. Hmm. Not what I would have expected from an eisbock, but based on the bottle description, I guess it is about what would be expected.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
4469,"2016-04-16",3.4,"From tap. Pours hazy brown with a small tan head. Aroma is acetone and dry wineous. Solid acetone. Fruity. Sharp acetic. Fruity and acetone finish.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
4469,"2016-04-16",4.0,"Super dark pour from 12oz bottle at green lady. He said its ""one of a kind"". Happy with his recommendation. Cherry and black berry aroma. Tart and sour. Mild tea and dunkle taste. Very good","Chicago, Illinois, USA","kaser"
4469,"2016-02-23",2.2,"Enjoy before February 2023, 33 cl bottle with a swingtop cap poured into a 22 oz snifter. Fridge temp and warming. Dark brown pour, almost black, with reddish hues. Cream colored head faded to a little more than a film stop the dark liquid. A thick cream colored ring circles the glass. Aroma is more like a Flanders than an eisbock. Cherry tart, berry cobbler in the nose. Taste is tart and fruitful with a bit of funk. Rum barrel treatment comes out mid taste but is more flavorful than alcoholic. I'm not sure this is intentionally funky. Decent marks for oud bruin but this is an eisbock. Moderate mouthfeel. For the style I would expect more viscosity and richness. Rum fighting with tartness and funk to prevail as the beer warms. Not bad but far from on-point.

4469,"2015-08-27",3.7,"19.08.2015, 0,33l bottle @ BierCab:
Nice creamy longlasting head. Aroma is slightly dry, oak, sour grass, dark malts, berry skin, sour dark fruits, alcohol, licorice. Taste is slightly sour-ish dry, oak, sour dark fruits, bark, sorrel, minerals, berry skin, grass, weeds. Medium bitterness, slightly sour-ish dry mouthfeel. Not very eisbocked Id say, but still nice and interesting.","Loddefjord, NORWAY","Inbreak"
4469,"2015-07-15",3.7,"330 mL bottle thanks to Jackl! Dark brown, large foamy tan head, good retention. Aroma of dark berries, peppery funk, caramel.

4469,"2015-05-21",3.9,"Bottle from HomeBrewStuff. Pricy but I like eisbocks and this is my first Swiss beer. Aroma is heady and sharp, indicating pretty well what youre about to get into to. Wine like smell, leads to sharp, sweet and sour tastes, sweet malts overwhelm, sour tang provides abrupt finish. Pretty tame at 9%, but a good rendition of the style. Nice late evening sipper.v","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"
4469,"2015-03-26",3.8,"Bottle thanks to jackl from his FBW contest. Poured dark red brown with beige head. Aroma funky berry malt sour. Light carb med bod. Gets pretty dry tart berry taste.","New York, New York, USA","charule"
4469,"2015-02-24",3.5,"chestnut brown with light-brown, fine head (5mm) fades to 1mm dusting. Aroma is very tart and rather fruity (sour cherry) light caramel, raisin, maybe a touch of spiced rum. Body is light, oily-starchy, carbonation is moderate, moderate coarseness, smooth, medium-light delayed burn. Flavor is a spicy pear wine, strong lactic (blueberry, cherry soured lambic notes, without the funk.) some chewy toffee underneath. Very little bitterness. Unlike any eisbock Ive ever had. Much more like a slightly roasted Flanders brown. If you go in with the expectation of a sour, you will enjoy this much more! -1 on overall of not labeling it as such.","Providence, Rhode Island, USA","PapaSkeetSkeet"
4469,"2015-02-01",3.0,"UPDATED: FEB 17, 2015 Bottle. Amber in color with a decent head. Aroma was dried fruit with a very slight hint of funk. Taste was raisin, fruity and suprisingly kind of tart.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","tnkw01"

4469,"2015-01-12",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2015 33cl swingtop bottle. Dark reddish brown pour with lots of bubbles and a surprisingly strong off-white head that sticks for awhile before receding. Aroma is of berries, cherries, oak, vinegar, and acetone on harder sniffs. Mouthfeel is heavy and thick. Lots of tartness and a bit of sourness, dark breadiness, fruits, red wine. Decent but not as good as the first one and in general this is one of the weaker series in their repertoire. Edit: as you get to the bottom of the glass this gets pretty tasty. Edit tried another pour of this 1 year about after bottling, and it is fantastic.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

This pours almost black with a 1 inch head of off white foam. Great lacing.

Mildly sour with some dark fruits, warming and taste from the rum barrel aging, I kike this offering from BFM.

Medium body and carbonation.

It has a nice bitterness in the flavor, some cocoa and alcohol in addition to the chocolate and coffee known from the aroma. Even fainter vinegar. Its lightly warming on the palate, with a soft carbonation. Lasting roasted malt finish. Pleasant indeed this one, although a bit warming for a 9% beer. 140523","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

4469,"2014-05-18",4.2,"Pours dark with a nice foam head. This one really looks like its a stout or a porter. Aroma is sour, acidic and doesnt have the maltiness the visual would suggest. Taste even more so - it tastes quite sour, sweetish, you can feel some fruits but there are also some smoked malts that are shining through.
