1146,"2017-04-22",4.2,"On tap at Nøgne Ø, Zwanze Day. It pours an unclear deep candy red body under a small dark pink head leaving nice curtains. Lots of raspberry in the aroma, with a deep blueberry scent, lemony, leathery funk and a wee touch of vanilla. Its sour and tart on the palate, full-bodied, surprisingly full-bodied for a lambic actually, with a pleasant carbonation level. Really smooth on the palate, even though its this sour. Leather, lemon and barnyard in the back, with raspberries dominating. Heavy blueberry flavor in the back, with a vanilla touch so weak I doubt Id noticed if I didnt know it was there. Eternal finish. A really fantastic beer, the blueberries really plays a significant role here. 161001","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

1146,"2016-12-22",4.0,"Bottle at source. Almost creamy intensely pink burgundy head, dark ruby red color. Intense aroma of berries and berry seeds of raspberris and somewhat not yet ripe blueberries. Only slightest notes of the vanilla lambic (which in itself is amazing), but then agaim it is used to build the backbone and not flavor itself.

1146,"2016-11-28",3.9,"Zwanze 16 drank at the scource on 161119

Pours ruby red with a purple note and a fluffy, bright pink head.

Smells of old wood and a light funkiness which gets overruled by ripe, sweet raspberries, which got the most jammy quality I have so far experienced in a Cantillon Lambic. Scented wood with a nice vanilla nuance mingles into a stone fruit earthiness, creating a very intriguing fruit composition. 

Soft on the tongue with a fitting carbonation, adding a nice crispness to the fruits, while the mouthfeel maintains its silkness throughout. Easy drinking with a sweetness, which gets almost matched by the berry tartness.

On the taste, the beer starts with raspberries, initially not unlike the Rosé de Gambrinus, until it gets accompanied by flowery sweet vanilla, finding a well fitting interaction in the old oak, which creates a soft rusticness. This revolts against the refreshing fruit acidity, evolving from a stone pit earthiness with raspberry jam on top. It finishes with a dominating, yet pleasant fruitiness which has by now overcome its wooden antagonist for the most part, while its lively tartness maintains the ability to cut through. 

Overall I dont think the vanilla addition is overly substantial, it almost prevents the beer from developing its usual complexity, since it cuts off the oak to a certain degree, replacing it by a unneccesary sweetness. Dont get me wrong, its sweetness is never coming close to being artificial on the tongue, it just does not provide the greatness of the Rosé (which, to be fair, is one of my all time favourites).","GERMANY","aleigator"

1146,"2016-10-24",3.9,"Reviewed from notes. Sampled at Zwanze Day at West Lakeview. Pours a deep red/almost purple color with just small amount of pink head. The nose is comprised mainly of seedy raspberry with maybe a touch of blueberry. I didnt really detect any vanilla on the nose or in the taste. The flavor was heavily reminiscent of RdG, there was jammy raspberry character accompanied by a healthy amount of funkiness. The blueberry was all but lost in the taste though IMO. Light mouthfeel, pleasant acidity, lively carbonation, and soft, dry finish. This was a nice beer, but didnt really differentiate itself much from the RdG we tried earlier that day.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"

Good blueberry, seems to dominate the raspberry which is just part of a generic berry fruit undertone. Some berry jam. Tangy lemony finish.

The pour is a dark ruby with a thick pink/light purple head that slowly falls down, leaving a couple spots of lace behind. The aroma is very heavily jammy with the raspberries and blueberries. Damn. Its a good mash, thats for sure. The vanilla is very light and faint on the nose. The flavor is a lot more funky than the nose would lead on. The jamminess is still there, but its just really funky over tart and sharp. The balance is actually pretty good. The mouth feel is a little thicker than I want it to be with a brighter carbonation and a lingeringly funky and sweet raspberry and blueberry jam. Im actually glad the vanilla wasnt more intense, because that couldve made it a mess. Good beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

1146,"2016-10-03",4.5,"Tasted multiple times at Rose Red in Bruges during Zwanze Day; this years edition honors the raspberry lambic Cantillon made back in the day when vanilla extract was added to soften the acidity, but upping the ante with added blueberries, and the vanilla extract has been replaced by real vanilla - clearly Cantillon can afford more now that craft beer culture has turned them into a world star... Thick and frothy, thickly lacing, off-pinkish head over a hazy, deep ruby red beer with even somewhat purplish hue. Aroma heavily emphasizes the fruit, with all kinds of things going on: a ton of red raspberries and indeed a hint of spicy blueberries, green tomato, sour yoghurt, stale sweat funkiness, wry grape peel, wet wood, sweet sherry, blackcurrant, clove-like spicy accent, red lambrusco, raw celery, very faint vanilla. Estery onset, acidity of unripe stonefruit and lemon but fairly soft for a Cantillon and not too puckering, overwhelming richness of red raspberries, lightly spicy blueberries clearly present (I guess reminiscent of the famous Blabaer, which I havent had yet), drying tartness throughout, lovely lactic sourness, soft bready and wheaty core underneath, thick layers of lambic funkiness in the end with a leathery Brett effect mixing well with the loads of berry juiciness and tartness, delicate vanilla shows up all the way at the back retronasally and blends with the oaky woody touch, yoghurty lactic sourness gets the last word and dries the finish, yeasty touch too and very faintly earthy but in all still relatively clean.

Le liquide est très foncé et pourrait facilement passer pkur une bière au cassis. Translucide. Ce nest pas la confiture de framboises à laquelle je mattendais. Un beau funk au nez qui laisse le fuut sur sa soif, faute dun bois vanillé encombrant. Non pas que lensemble soit surpuissant, bien au contraire. Cest délicat. Même ce funk à tendance Cantillonnais est très délicat. En bouche, le fruit prend des allures de confiture et comme le disent à raison les Marc-André, de Jello au fruit.
