3775,"2017-05-30",3.8,"Draught at Ginger Man Boston, 5/3/17.Glassy amber-auburn with a small, beige head showing moderate to low retention.Unsurprisingly there is plentiful malt character in the nose showing bread and caramel being met by light oxidation and lots of melanoidins that help balance all of the sweetness. Also of surprise, it doesnt seem messy or boozy for its size, no doubt owing to the large amount of malt, but one hops also due to the proper lagering time. Some vivacious yellow and orange fruit notes, also stemming from the malt, help keep things from getting too bogged down in acidic melanoidins and rich caramel.First impressions in the mouth are quite lovely. Soft smoke in to cherry-caramel and finally ending on proper balancing acidity for the style from the meladnoidins. Alcohol is no where to be found and the texture is, of course, soft, supple, malt-and-wheat-heavy with low carbonation but no syrupiness. Rich, rewarding and not cloying, though my days of drinking these things are long over and a sample is plenty.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Aroma: Sweet and malty, caramel/toffee/treacle, quite a lot of berry-like fruitiness, a bit spicy and a bit tangy (sour cherries), toasted bread crust and melanoidins, light banana-like esters, a little booze.
 
Palate: Medium+ body, low to moderate carbonation.
 
Flav.: Big malt and fruit presence, malt is toffee, toasted bread crust, melanoidin, toffee, fruit is strawberries, sour cherries, more berries, banana-like esters round things out with a bit of spiciness and booziness to give some edges to the overall profile; lightly sweet with moderate bitterness and a lightly tangy, malty, fruity, boozy and estery finish.

3775,"2016-12-04",4.0,"Bottle from Beer Square, Santiago. Pours a hazy orange color wih a small bubbly head that disappears mostly pretty fast. Aroma is intensely fruity with notes of honey, mango, apple fritters, cinnamon, cake, biscuit, donuts, refined sugars and a bit of lemon. Quite nice considering the lack of head. Taste is delicious, chewy cake and fruit salad. Spices like cinnamon and clove, orange, mango and papaya. What a delight! Big mouthfeel, chewy and sticky. A very nice, well crafted dessert beer.

3775,"2016-12-02",3.6,"750ml bottle with mini-card bought at Running Beers booth at Harbourfront in Central during Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival Expo 2016.
Looks: Translucent amber honey colour with a ring of dirt-like yeast sediments; Three quarter finger head with soapy off-white foam which lasted for 1 minute; Fair sticky lacing and active small carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragment and sweet malt, with wheaty tartness, strong honey, strong gooseberry, dark berries, strong banana, grapefruits, caramel, strong floral, sugar, resins, sweet bread, yeast, lemon and grass.

Taste: Strong sweet amber malt, with strong caramel, strong toffee, strong banana, wheaty tartness, strong alcohol, floral, strong molasses, spices, light bread, yeast, fair lemon and medium bitter grassy hops. Pretty intense!

Body: Medium body. Slick and oily palate.

Mouth Feel: Strong, Ambrée-like maltyness in a pretty thick background. Full on tasty caramel and toffee with strong booze, which suppresses much of wheatyness. Flowery and very sweet but in a pleasant way. Spicy and light bready with lemon to round. Hard hitting!

Booziness: the 10% abv is liquorish, notably strong in sweet smell and butt-naked in taste, yet its balanced well by toffee and caramel. Got some knock on after half a pint, but in a pleasant way. Okay.

Hoppiness: strong gooseberry, dark berries, grapefruits, strong floral, resins, lemon and grass in nose. Floral, spices, lemon and gras in taste; Bitterness is fair for a lasting, medium astringent sweet malty finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Boozy sweet and fairly bitter to mouth.

Comments: This is more like an Eisbock then a Weizenbock, as its aroma and taste is pretty much resembles a strong Belgian Ambrée. The pleasantly fruity hop and banana ester aroma could not mask the overtly strong booziness and its taste is not as complex as Tap 5 Meine Hopfen-Weisse. Very nice to drink, but I like the Tap 5 and Tap 6 (Aventinus) better. Worth trying, but better share it with friends!

Very intense musty fruitiness, and the phenolicness is like a Hopfenweisse without the hops. A bit irritating. Taste is phenolic, spicy, hints of honey and darker fruits. Very phenolic-boozy, warming finish. Silky mouthfeel.Not bad, but extremely intense, and quite a letdown from what I?ve expected. Way too boozy. I am not yet sure what to think of this. It?s not bad per se, Schneider has never brewed a bad beer imho, but even if you accept the heavy booziness and mustiness, it?s not excellent. I?ll give it another chance some time. Most people I?ve talked to at Braukunst thought it was particularly bad.EDIT: Tried again at the last BKL16 day. This definitely needs some time in the bottle. I can?t help but think they didn?t have full control over this, which is very unexpected from Schneider. I still think it?s good if you are fine with very intense Weizenbocks and some mustyness, but I did have very high expectations. Let?s see if it gets better after a few months in the bottle, I really hope so.EDIT: Tap, in June 2016. Not as crazily musty, but too much umami now, and still a huge letdown for Schneider standards. Adjusted from 3.5 to 3.2, although this would more be a 2.7....
