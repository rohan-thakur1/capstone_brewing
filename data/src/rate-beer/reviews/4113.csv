4113,"2016-10-02",4.6,"50cl ceramic swing top bottle pours with a dark purple body that has ruby red hues and tosses up some nice thick legginess. The massive aroma offers up thick blueberry and berry notes with somewhat tart smelling berry skin as well as smooth soft rich honey cut by booze and a bit of a woody sensation. The taste is . . . oh man! This is rich and nectar like with intense berry and blueberry fruitiness that gets into a earthy berry skin character. Right about when the berry earthy note hits the smooth thin soft sweet vanilla joins in to take this to yet another level. Theres also only echoes of sweet honey going on here well underneath the berry goodness. Delicious. Just a terrific mead to slowly sip on and allow life around you to slow down as you contemplate its rich depths.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

4113,"2015-06-11",4.3,"2 oz sample from kbudd19, massive thanks for this one Kevin!

Appearance: Deep blueberry color with reddish hues and alcohol legs. 

Aroma: Massive blueberry and white chocolate presence. Lots of honey sweetness as well with a bit of alcohol and plums. 

Taste: Really sweet but not unbalanced at all with a massive amount of both blueberries and white chocolate. Rich honey. The alcohol shows up a bit, but isnt out of place at all. 

Palate: Full body. Mouth coating sweetness. Syrupy mouthfeel. Warming finish. Lingering blueberry and white chocolate presence.

Overall: This is what should be pictured beside the definition of ""decadent"" in the dictionnary. A blueberry-white chocolate cheesecake in a bottle. Its hard to believe this isnt completely unbalanced... but it isnt. Not on the level of Schramms The Statement Reserve or Heart of Darkness, but probably the closest contender that I have tried so far. Fantastic stuff!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
