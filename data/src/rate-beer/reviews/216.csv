Blandish aroma, fruity, some book glue (but not quite starch). Pale, small head. Full sweet palate. No fucking way this is a kolsch. However, it¬ís an an interesting flavour. There is a bit of a spirity alcohol kick, but nice sweet malts, a bit spicy, indistinct spice variety, but interesting. Nettles and toffee in the finish. Bit to sweet, but the carbonation cut through that. Not a kolsch, I suspect they¬íre trying to get ""top 50 kolsch"" byt brewing a hoppy sweet IPA-ish brew. But to me it says ""I don¬ít know what a kolsch is, derp derp derp"". Booze particularly out of place. Scoring accordingly.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

216,"2016-06-24",3.5,"6.7%ABV. Kolsch.

Tapped out gold. 6¬∫SRM.

Nose has some nice pale malt in the nose but with a saison like funk.

Mouthfeel is a watery soapy. Palate has some nice roasted malt flavor.

Finish is hoppy, piney and bitter and medium long.

If correctly tapped, not a very typical Kolsch. I would say this is Kolsch-inspired rather than a Kolsch which should be pale, light on the alcohol and certainly with little to no hop flavor.

Overall, still a. very creditable tipple: closer to a west coast IPA.","SINGAPORE","drjoeng"

216,"2016-05-26",3.9,"330 ml bottle into pint glass, best before 7/12/2017. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of lemon, grapefruit, orange peel, pineapple, peach, pear, light pepper/pine, cracker, biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/earthy hops, fruity yeast, and bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, grapefruit, orange peel, pineapple, peach, pear, light pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/herbal/spicy bitterhess on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, grapefruit, orange peel, pineapple, peach, pear, pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/earthy hops, fruity yeast, and bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance; with some slight lingering hop astringency building up after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, that increases through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately sticky/resinous, and fairly creamy/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice kolsch/IPA hybrid style. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/earthy hops, fruity yeast, and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink. This was pretty interesting and unique. I can see the base Kolsch style characteristics, but it has a lot of citrus/piney hops on top of it. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
