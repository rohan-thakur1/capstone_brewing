441,"2016-04-19",3.1,"Sampled at a sushi joint in Kabukicho, Tokyo. Crystal clear pour could be mistaken for water. Served chilled, but the alcohol vapors still were evident on the nose. Flavor a bit rough around the edges, but was still enjoyable notes of pear and apple and maybe a kiss of honey. Not my favorite sake, but still quite palatable. At a reasonably priced $8/bottle, it gets an extra point for value.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Butters"
