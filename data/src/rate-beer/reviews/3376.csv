Smells like oldish grass thats been mixed with cat pee, hay, cucumber juices and a little bit of old lemons. Strange, but not directly unpleasant either. A little dull in the taste. It has a soft oily texture and its the below average on the carbonation. I get a mild bitterness in the back, traces of both hazelnut and straw. A little bit of citrus all the way in the finish.

This dank Pale Ale sweats citrus and resins onto a bitter and snappy finish.

-A veil of foam covers the hazy golden.
-This is very flavourful throughout.
-Aroma and flavour are expressive but could be brighter.
-Carbonation is soft and drinkability quite high.
