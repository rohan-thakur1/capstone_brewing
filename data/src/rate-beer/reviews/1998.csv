1998,"2012-02-10",3.8,"Tasted on draft at FoBAB 2011.  Pours very dark amber with an average tan head that leaves thin lace.  The nose is the best example of a dark chocolate covered espresso bean that I have come across.  The flavor is very dry, dark chocolate covered espresso bean with some nice bitterness.  The body is medium with a bit more than average carbonation and a long chocolate covered espresso bean finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
1998,"2012-02-01",4.0,"FoBAB 11 Im a fan of coffee bender to begin with and I think the vanilla and cocoa nibs with the oak woodiness adds a nice little something. Id still drink more of the base if both were readily available, but its a very good festival beer.","Long Lake, Illinois, USA","JoePeesie"
1998,"2011-12-03",4.5,"On tap@ Mackenzies Pub (Minneapolis). A wonderfully thick malty beer. Perfectly dark and inviting, much like Coffee Bender, though the head gets lost quickly (eh). Wonderful mocha latte aroma. Thick and syrupy on the palate with awesome toffee and chocolate, lots of chocolate, flavor with a good bitterness from the nibs which is unique from coffee bender. If youre a dark hot chocolate fan, this is your beer.","Minnesota, USA","brosen561"
1998,"2011-11-27",3.6,"Draft at darkness day. Liked this beer more than normal coffee bender. Had a nice nose containing a light sweetness and dark chocolate notes. It was pleasantly bitter and had an interesting finish. I would want to taste this again to figure out the finish. I liked it though. Deep brown color with a beige head.","Minnesota, USA","emeinz"
1998,"2011-11-26",3.5,"Pours brown with tan head.  I didnt like this one as much as the regular Coffee Bender.  Nice coffee, chocolate flavor, with touch of wood.","","User29624"
1998,"2011-11-18",3.7,"Sampled from the tap at 2011 FOBAB. Poured a deep murky brown with a yellowish brown head that dissipated slowly to the edges. Aroma had notes of coffee with a backing creaminess, vanilla and dark grains. Flavor had a nice combination of vanilla and coffee with a hint of chocolate and barrel backing. Quite nice.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1998,"2011-11-14",2.6,"tap at fobab.   like coffee bender quite a bit.  didnt like this.   Weird artificial vanilla, playdough,  anise, graham cracker, sweet doughy bread notes.    masked the nice clean coffee taste of regular coffee bender.  too sweet.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
1998,"2011-11-14",3.2,"Draft at FoBAB 9. Pours a reddish brown with an offwhite head. The nose is muted coffee and more of the cocoa and vanilla. Also a root beer type thing going on. Kind of all over the place and not as good as the base. On tasting, its on the sweeter side, kinda like a vanilla latte or something. Creamy and sweet, light coffee and roast. Odd beer overall.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
1998,"2011-11-02",3.6,"On draught at Darkness Day 
Pours a deep ruby color with a small head and some lace. 
 
The aroma has lots and lots of coffee and some dark chocolate. The beer has a mild roastiness and some vanilla. Very sweet smelling all around. 
 
The flavor is coffee and vanilla with a light whiskey booziness. Some roast flavor is here and the hops flavor has slipped into the background while the bitterness they impart is pleasantly still around. 
 
The palate is fairly thin but the mild carbonation makes this easy and enjoyable to drink.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

1998,"2011-10-21",3.7,"On tap at Stub and Herbs ""Darkness Eve"". 
Very inviting coffee and hazelnut aroma. Flavors of hazelnut and malt hit you first with a bit of a mellow oak, chocolate, and coffee at the end. Very drinkable. Not a big beer, but has lots of flavor.","Richfield, Minnesota, USA","nsquishee"
1998,"2011-10-04",5.0,"Ported from my BA account. It should be noted that this is, as of right now, my favorite beer.

Appearance:
Brown with a reasonable head. Dark and hazy, but not much light gets through.

Smell:
Chocolate and vanilla, with coffee in the background. Malty sweetness is apparent throughout.

Taste: Vanilla and coffee, with chocolate gaining headway in the middle. A slightly toasty malt finish coming back to chocolate flavor.

Mouthfeel:
Creamy and smooth with lowish carbonation.

Drinkability:
The highest. This is the one. It tastes so smooth and rich, without being overpowering. This is one that you could drink all night, regardless of the strong flavors.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"
1998,"2011-06-21",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 28, 2011 Tap at the Surly Brewery.  Served in a pint glass.  The vanilla, chocolate, and coffee flavors make this a beer that definitely stands out.  If you like bland beer, this ones not for you.  Delicious!","Minnesota, USA","WymanJ"
1998,"2011-06-05",4.1,"Tap at ACBF. Brown pour with a smallish white head. Aroma is absolutely loaded with coffee grounds, chocolate, and woody vanilla. Flavor is the same; awesome combination of bitter coffee and sweet chocolate/vanilla, but still drinkable, not too rich. Damn tasty.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
1998,"2011-05-14",3.6,"Tap.  Brown with ruby highlights.  Small white head.  Looks like bender.  Everything about this reminds me of cocoa krispies, except it doesnt pop in your mouth.  Creamy and filled with chocolate flavors.  Fuck yes!","Minnesota, USA","mattyb83"
1998,"2011-03-29",3.9,"On tap at Darkness Day, drank from plastic Surly cup...A bright brown pour with a decent tan head...The aroma is tons of coffee with lots of vanilla mixed in, very creamy, roasty and probably a touch to sweet...The taste is all coffee again with lots of cream, this is basically an espresso. I like it though, maybe because it is sweet and cuts a lot of the coffee.

I drank my glass pretty easy, Id recommend trying this.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
1998,"2011-03-28",3.5,"taken from a keg tapped outside while waiting in line for darness day.  Pours dark brown with a white head. smell is of deep vanilla, and actaully some chocolate. Up front is a large amount of vanilla which finishes with a oaky coffee chocolate flaovr.  Good beer for 8 30 in the morning.","Fergus Falls, Minnesota, USA","bobbypaulson"
1998,"2011-03-01",4.5,"poured into a glass coffee mug at McKenzies Pub downtown minneapolis 
dark brown hazy color with a nice foamy tan head. retention didnt last too long. 

smelled of super roasty coffee, powdered chocolate, and marshmellow vanilla. There were very small hints of nuttiness and malt. pretty sure all the roast smell was from the coffee but possibly from some roasted barley. 

Tasted imediately of roasted coffee and a nice sweet maltiness. as the taste moved across the tongue huge hits of powder sweet chocolate come through. there is a nice mellow vanilla flavor that comes with the chocolate here in the first few sips. it finishes with the roasted coffee bitterness and perhaps some bitterness from hops(pretty sure its a good combination) As i let this warm up a bit the vanilla became a lot more pronounced like the chocolate and marshmallow section of a smores. the vanilla was much more intense in the last few ounces. 

The mouthfeel was pretty typical of a brown ale, if i could change anything it would be to add some creaminess to the beer. it was just a hair on the thinner side as far as mouthfeel, but intense taste made up for it. 

This stuff drank easy. wanted to sit and drink them all night long. 

Dessert beer for sure, or just an afternoon sipper, hell, id have this in the morning on a fishing or camping trip just like coffee bender. id love to make an ice cream float with this or put it in some cupcakes too!","Bloomington, Minnesota, USA","SourNotes"
1998,"2011-02-15",3.7,"Pours a clean dark brown with an off white head.  Aroma of vanilla, chocolate and oak.  The vanilla really hits you in the taste with smaller amounts oakey, coffee and chocolate flavors following.  Similar lighter palette to the Coffee bender compared to the regular bender.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","undsioux7"
1998,"2011-02-07",3.6,"Minnesota Winterfest 2011.  Dark reddish color with a small head.  Strong coffee aroma.  Vanilla-laden oak character dominates the flavor.  Coffee fades back to mild.  Light roast.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
1998,"2010-11-11",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2011 On tap at DDay (Thanks Omar!, and armin for grabbing me one!)  Almost chunky white head on top of a dark brown body.   More balanced that Coffee Bender, but this results in no flavors dominating...no ""wow"" on the first sip.  Lots of coffee, vanilla, bourbon flavors make up for this...wish I had another one so I could take my time with it more.7.4.7.4.15

Re-Rate, on tap at Stubs, 5th Ani Event.
Nice dark pour, decent light brown head, with ok lacing.  Aroma is all about the chocolate on this one.  It just wafts out of the glass.  Some nice woody notes, some vanilla.  Coffee lurking as well, though not overly present.  Flavor shifts from the chocolate nose to coffee and vanilla taste.  Very nice.  A great dry oaky finish.  Liked it a lot more this time around.","California, USA","LamarBurton"
1998,"2010-11-05",3.6,"sampled at gtmw 2010... pours a dark toffee brown with a fluffy tan head... assertive coffee and vanilla aroma profile... flavors much akin to coffee bender but with an added vanilla presence and a sweeter profile overall....pretty good with the aroma being nicer than how it tasted, at least for me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
1998,"2010-10-26",3.8,"On draft at Darkness Day 2010. Brown in colour with low carbonation. Aromatic profile is dominated by vanilla and caramel, backed by milk chocolate and fresh roasted coffee notes. Surprisingly gentle in the mouth with pale, toasted, and roasted malts all working in concert. Reminded me a bit of cafe au lait, with a vanilla undertone. Not overly sweet, and very drinkable.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
1998,"2010-10-23",3.9,"Tap at Darkness Day 2010. Dark cola brown pour with a foamy off-white head. Aroma of sharp coffee and toffee. Taste was vanilla, chocolate, and coffee grounds. Awesome.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
1998,"2010-10-03",4.2,"Tasting at Autumn brew review. Pour was brown with a kahki head. Aroma sweet malt with chocolate and coffee. Taste was more the same with a nice creamy texture along with the chocolate and coffee. Palate was full and creamy with a dry finish. Tasty!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
1998,"2010-10-02",3.8,"On tap at Autumn Brew Review.    Creamy dark brown pour, plenty of carbonation and an aroma of regular coffee bender and chocolate.  Flavor is heavy earthy chocolate, a little noticeable coffee and finished very creamy, full bodied and a little sweet.  Decent brew, but I still like the regular Coffee Bender better.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
1998,"2010-09-24",4.0,"Draft at the Great Taste. Pours a nice brown ale color with a nice tan head, very similiar looking to the regular Surly Coffee Bender. Strong coffee and vanilla in the nose with some subtle chocolate aromas. I dont get too much oak in the aroma. Very smooth and velvety medium mouthfeel. Sweet up front chocolate taste followed by some coffee flavors. The vanilla is pretty pronounced and you ccan taste it the whole time you are drinking. Very well done and tasty. So far a favorite at GT.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
1998,"2010-08-18",3.8,"Sampled at GTMW 2010 - Pours dark cola with a nice foamy tan head. Light, smooth coffee and vanilla dominate the nose, with mild, milky roast. Its a sweet yet delicate smell that I could quaff all day. The taste is similar, but the coffee taste is more like coffee grounds and note enough like coffee. The vanilla and sweetness balances it out a bit, but that bitter taste is still lingering. Its thin and a bit watery, but that actually works in its favor because the taste is more like an iced coffee drink than actual coffee. The concept of this beer is fantastic, and I love both Bender and Coffee Bender. Why not make it more decadent? If the coffee had been on for me, this one would have been fantastic. As it stands, it was simply very good.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
1998,"2010-08-17",3.9,"GTMW 2010.  Pours to a dark ruby brown body with a dark beige head.  Ridiculous chocolate coffee aroma.  Flavor was more muted and didnt have the coffee come through as much as Id have thought.  More chocolate and vanilla covers up the typical Bender flavors and the coffee that I love so nicely in Coffee Bender.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
1998,"2010-08-15",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2010 Sampled on tap at the GTMW 10 (Madison, WI). Pours a dark brown with lighter glowing edges, a huge brownish head stays and laces. Aromas are big coffee grinds, vanilla, cocoa, toffee, heavenly sweet coffee cake, some wet oak and vanilla tannins further intensify. Initial is medium bodied, good coffee and vanilla, touch of cocoa grows into dark chocolate, biscuits and toffee, brown malts, coffee grounds, a touch of nuttiness. Light florals, smooth and sweeter slanted though. Big coffee brown ale with rich cakey and vanilla, cocoa flavors. Reminds me of coffee bender, but bigger with oak and vanilla, a touch more cocoa and decent roastiness. Finish is bitter with good coffee grinds, cocoa, rich french vanilla. Tasty. The beer sounds simple enough, some might find it to be possibly cloying but Id disagree. This is quite the homerun out of Surly. One of my Top 3 beers of GTMW 2010.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
1998,"2010-05-07",4.4,"On tap at Mackenzies.  Pours reddish brown/black with nice off white head.  Aroma is thick chocolate, vanilla, with some coffee notes.  Wow, this sounded amazing and was every bit as good as I thought it would be.  Huge chocolate and vanilla up front blend seamlessly into the coffee and bitter notes at the end of regular Coffee Bender.  This is fantastic, and a seriously delicious brew.  Hope they make more of this.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
1998,"2010-05-07",3.8,"Omar and Todd continue to make me chase all over the Twin Cities just to keep up with their new beers. Thank goodness for Facebook, this one was on draught at MacKenzies in Minneapolis, MN. Pours a semi-clear dark brown colored brew with a fast dissolving light beige head and dissipates to a thin off-white ring. Aroma of chocolate malt, espresso, a hint of vanilla whipping cream, and a touch of toffee. Taste is medium bodied, quite smooth with still more coffee flavor than the infused chocolate and vanilla. Finish has a good balance of dry and sweet aftertaste as the vanilla flavor comes out mixed with their regular Coffee Bender. The dark chocolate is well hidden. Still an excellent variation as I hope to see this again at the Surly sponsored beer festivals. Come to think of it, I would be curious to try a hazelnut and vanilla infused Coffee Bender next time.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
