2397,"2015-09-07",4.0,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a slightly hazed reddish amber color with a big billowy white head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a layer of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the brew is rather strong of a toffee and bready aroma with some other smells of some sweet notes of a dark fruits (raisin and plum) and caramel along with a bit of a nutty aroma as well. Along with these smells comes some lighter hop notes of an earthy and herbal nature, giving an overall quite nice smell to the brew.
 Taste  The taste begins very malty with tons of lightly toasted bready tastes. Along with these flavors comes a good deal of sweetness, being a mix of the toffee/caramel and some darker fruit notes. The hop are very light upfront, but as the taste moves forward more hop of a pine, earthy, and herbal nature come to the tongue. The roasted flavors seem to get a bit stronger as the taste moves on, all while some of the sweeter flavors lose a bit of ground. With the hop increasing in presence a bit more right at the end, one is left with a very malty and roasty but decently sweeter taste to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is rather thick for its mere 5.3% abv. nature with a carbonation level that is rather average. The thicker body nicely accentuates the roasty and bready flavors rather well, accentuating these flavors rather nicely.
 Overall- A rather robust red ale at a more moderate abv. This is a great fall style brew. Rather tasty and actually pretty balanced. While it is malty and somewhat sweet, it has a good balance of hop to make it very enjoyable.","","Darkmagus82"

Ample, grainy maltiness, dog biscuits and caramel. Slick sugars and a buried buttered popcorn sensation, cloying. Flavor is simple, with grains and needly hops, burnt orange rinds, acerbic bitterness in the way of raspberry seeds, or over-steeped tea leaves, expectedly. Damp, earthy notes - wet leaves, wood, and must - are helpful to sustain drinkability amidst the prominent partnership of sugars and sticky resins. Limp palate. Since this is neither a malt-forward nor a clean, deceptively simple beer, the nitrogen treatment doesnt seem helpful.  Butter-dominant with warming.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Not bad, but Im a bit disappointed to have gotten snookered with yet another out of date bottle. I dont think its too far gone, but I suspect the hops would have been a bit brighter had I gotten it before its best-by. However, the hop character thats present still makes it an interesting red, instead of the same old malt-forward tediousness that tends to make reds so very bland. And I dont think the hops were ever intended to be bold, given the use of Tettnanger. OK, fine, theres Amarillo too, but still. And maybe the noble hop presence makes this a little more impervious to aging? (15/20)","CANADA","UXO"

2397,"2014-06-07",3.4,"I didnt want to wait on this since I saw on the side that the best by date is June 24, 2014.
Anyways, well, I poured this into a pint glass.
The appearance was a nice hazy looking dark red color with a decent two finger white foamy head that must last for a good minute and a half. The head turns a bit lumpy on me with a slightly off-white color to it. There is some decent lacing.
The smell had some nice bitter Northwest piney hops backed up by a nice crisp craker-like maltiness.
The taste was mainly bitter but added a nice citrus to malty sweetness as it warmed. Theres a decent bitter to somewhat sweet citrusy aftertaste leading to a semi-dry finish.
On the palate, it sat at/about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionable aspect to it. The carbonation actually is somewhat smooth and for the most part is pretty good for the style and for me.
Overall, this is a good American Amber/Red ale worthy of having again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Its got lots of hoppy spiciness going on, its like you took a big chunk of spicy moss out of the ground and shoved it into your gaping mouth with a long pine cone, and then chewed the pine bark and a cinnamon stick with some fizzy biting zazz. You are walking through the great vast forest of eternal sorrow, when a shadowy figure emerges from the thicket and as you are paralyzed with fear, it draws near and shoves pine cones into your gaping eyesockets with reckless abandon...

2397,"2010-11-24",4.3,"I am unfortunate enough to never have this beer ever again, as it is retired. I know I am cheating by rating a beer I havent had in over 18 months, but I just learned of its retiring.  I was waiting till January to get it again and rate it. But since that will never happen, I am forced to rate it based on memory.  Good thing its one of the most unique and memorable beers I ever did have. Anyhow, it pours out a coppery red under a bubbly white head. Aroma is very pleasant, calling mainly upon sweet caramel and toffee notes, with some pine hop whiffs to back it up. Taste is just as delicious. Earthy malt notes are noticeable first, but are soon mellowed into caramel and grassy pine hops. Its greatly balanced, but bitter at the end, but by no means overpoweringly so. Earthy, toasty, toffee, and hop profiles swirl in the mouth pleasingly well and bring you back for more. It is a true shame they retired this beer. This is one of the 5 or so beers that opened my eyes in the early days of my beer snobbery, and is in fact the first beer I liked that wasnt black or dark brown in color.

How: Bottle 12oz.  Consumed fresh soon after receiving it from Blutt59.  Thanks a lot Bob.
The look: Cloudy redish body topped by small-medium white head.  Good looking brew with that contrast of color
In long: Light but pleasant nose of caramel and leafy hops.  Taste of hard candies, leafy hops, a touch of caramel, dry grass.  The type of flavour profile I often get from beers with the name that contains red ale.  The finish is medium dry with the dry burnt grass going nose-to-nose with the caramel and hard-candies.  There was also some light plastic/phenol notes and the beer lost a few points because of that.  Lean body and too much carbonation (soda-pop level).  I drank their excellent Red Chair a few days ago and I thought it was underrated and now I find this well-rated Cinder Cone overrated.  Im assuming my bottle was fresh since I got it in a trade from a local but it just did not taste fresh.  I need to try this one again and make sure it as fresh as a foetus soup.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The flavor is a bit less hoppy than Rogues red, but its still enjoyable.

Smell  The Amarillo hops really come through with the first whiff. Everything is a bit muted, but there is some caramel and mostly floral hops coming through.

Taste  A lot maltier than expected from the nose. The hops are a lot muted in the taste than I expected as well. It is funny, this beer is flip-flopped when it comes to taste and smell. This does taste very well balanced with the caramel malts and the choice hops; very well balanced. The caramel taste is a lighter taste, not too in your face.

Mouthfeel  Nice and light. This beer is here is quench your thirst on a hot (somewhat, it is a spring seasonal after all) day. The carbonation is prickly and satisfying.

Though Im often in the mood for a ""red ale"" these days, which I take to mean a beer with lots of caramel notes, the Cinder Cone fell a notch short of my appalingly high expectations.  After the pour the Cinder Cones custard colored head flattens immediately into a thick, dense pancake, below which the deep red brew sits expectantly.  The aroma cascades from the glass, robust and provocative with caramel, toffee, more caramel, brown sugar, caramel, and a dry cinder block dustiness.  The flavor is somewhat akin to the aroma, starting sweet with a razor sharp cinnamon edge, then dipping into a thick bath of malt bitterness.  From here it zig-zags between sweet, spicy and bitter all the way to a quiet and echoing aftertaste.

2397,"2008-04-04",4.6,"12 ounce bottle. Seasonal ale.

This is my favorite beer. It is not the best beer that I have ever had, but it is my favorite. The distinction lies in that it is consistent, I can drink it with pretty much any food I pair it with, and that I never tire of drinking it. Some of the best beers that I have had only work in particular settings or with particular types of foods. Not Cinder Cone Red. It pleases all of the time.

The pour delivers a rich garnet body with a long-lasting ivory head. The body is clear with carbonation that is light, lively, and ever present. The lacing is excellent and intricate.

The aroma is complex.  Caramel is the primary malt aroma.  Light citrus, and a flourish of pine, on occasion, represent the hops.  The other aromas are raisin, plum, cherry, and red wine.

The flavor ""pulls back"" ever so slightly from the aroma to concentrate on four primary tastes: caramel, cherry, plum, and a faint red wine.  The focus in the midst of complexity is what really makes this ale shine!  Yet, it is also an easily accessible beer.  The initial flavor is sweet, matures into a light bitterness, and finishes with a combination of sweet and bitter that lingers.  It is lightly oily on the tongue.  Every so often, a hint of pine sneaks in to tease.

Cinder Cone Red is an ale for all occasions.  I can imagine it with potato chips or roast duck.  It works well during a nice meal or refreshes after mowing the lawn.  I think I need one right now!","Washington, USA","troysworktable"

2397,"2007-10-11",3.5,"06-Mar-07 (12 oz bottle, Best By 03-May-07: BevMo in La Jolla, CA) Scott, our Deschutes rep here in San Diego, stopped by my BevMo to conduct a tasting for our customers and Cinder Cone was probably my favorite.  Its a fairly clean red ale, very much a hops-forward beer without being really hoppy or bitter.  The mix of old and new world hops are quite floral, yet suggest herbal tea at times as well.  A bit of pine comes on toward the finish, providing medium bitterness from start to finish.  Medium-sweet malts are both toasty and caramely, but are polite enough to deflect most of the attention to the hops.  Yeast contributes a hint of orange stone fruit and perhaps a trace of butteriness.  Floral hops really dominates the nose if I swirl the glass, but once that blows off, the beer has a fruity and grainy aroma.  Medium-bodied, ample but soft carbonation, smooth mouthfeel.  The off-white head pours to about a quarter inch in height, gradually settling to a broken film atop the hazy, deep amber body.  Modest but intricate and attractive lace encircles the glass near the initial pour line, with a few random slashes below.  Overall, an enjoyable beer that fits well in the Deschutes brewing philosophy and a very nice seasonal to look forward to.20-Nov-05 (12 oz bottle: BevMo in San Diego/Carmel Mountain, CA) Heres an aged bottle of Cinder Cone with a Best By date of 03-Jun-05 that I figured Id drink to finish off the six-pack.  I have to say, expired or not, this beer is still really nice.  The flavor is still nutty, gently caramely, and moderately hoppy and bitter, with some grapefruit in there.  Still flavorful and well-balanced, no loss of hops, no transition toward earthiness.  Nutty, caramely and hoppy nose.  Medium bodied, perfectly carbonated, soft and coating on the palate, kind of oily and slippery.  Slightly hazy, medium amber color.  The tall, off-white head shows excellent retention, maintaining a complete layer atop the beer.  Doesnt seem like this beer improves nor worsens with moderate aging, so no worries if the beer extends a few months beyond the expiration date.  All numbers stay the same, except appearance because this beer pours better tonight than it did on tap at Humpys. (7, 4, 7, 3, 14 = 3.5)18-Aug-04 (Draft: Humpys Ale House in Anchorage, AK) Flavorful, moderately malty, caramely and sweet, with a noticeable nuttiness, but also fairly bitter for nice balance.  Has a mildly hoppy nose with a lightly malty, moderately sweet honey aroma.  Light to medium body seems a bit on the watery side, but its passable.  Reddish amber color.  Light tan head fades to a thin sheen and small rim. (7, 3, 7, 3, 14 = 3.4)","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Also smells like chewed bubble gum. Flavor is heavy with hops, but lacking in elegance. Probably pushed just a bit too far Id say. You get a slight punch in the mouth from the expected hop influece, but it isnt rounded out at all. Feel is decent. Nice level of carbonation, but there is so much put into this one, that it makes it heavy and thick on the tongue. Drinkable, sure.

2397,"2007-07-09",3.3,"Translucent and shiny copper in color with a bubbles-feeding-head mentality. Bubbles popping at the crest create an icy grey surface. Aroma speaks to succulent, sugary hops. Candi sugar is crusted on ruby red grapefruit, joining forces with buttered almonds, amaretto toffee and a hint of blood oranges to all form a rather well composed nose. Flavor swings in with brandy stewed nuts, diluted with holy water, and then get aided with a sprig of spruce. Buttery toffee is caught off the eastern seaboard and held in a perpetual standoff. Amicable bitterness hums dryly on the rooftop while gummy, cherry juice and caramel sap slide off of seasoned spruce needles. The medium body never changes directions, for better or worse. Oxidized pistachios ring with a touch of the tin nut can liner and a numbed, caramel amaretto toffee character perseveres until the slightly bitter end.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

That other stuff being fruity maltyness and a light amount of bitter hops in the finish. Some roasted/toasted flavors surface to give this beer a well-rounded flavor.

Pours with a frothy, two-finger thick full tan colored head.  The beer is a deep amber color that shows a brilliantly clear ruby color when held up to the light.  The aroma is characteristically hoppy with an American accent; I get notes of sweet ruby-red grapefruit, and an undercurrent of herbal pine.  There is a touch of malt evident in the nose as well, it reminds me of freshly crushed soda crackers.

The taste is certainly hop dominated from the get go; a nice, though not overwhelming, astringent bitterness carries from start to finish.  There is a light malty sweetness, which plays up the fruity citrus hop notes.  The hops are also notably pine-like, even more so than the aroma; in fact the grapefruit notes and the pine notes are about in an even balance in the flavor of this beer.  The end has a strangely dry finish.  I say strangely because there is still a bit of sweet malt lingering on in my taste buds, yet my mouth is dry.  It definitely makes you want another sip of this brew.  Besides the sweet malt, there is also a biscuit/ soda cracker note here, perhaps even a slight toasted malt note as well.

This is actually quite a tasty, quaffable brew.  I was not too sure what to expect from this beer, but it is nicely hoppy, yet still has some interesting underlying malt notes that bring a needed complexity to this brew.

Ill be honest and say that I dont like this at all.  The malt flavor is very amateurish (and yes, I am aware that I am speaking of Deschutes here), almost like beginner homebrew and the Amarillo and Tettnang combination needs to either be amped up substancially or switched out for hops more powerful and more fitting for the style, like Centennial or Chinook.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"

Burgandy red appearance with minimal white head.  citrus hops and slight toasty malts, but mostly sweet hops on the aroma.  Some green apple notes on the aroma as well.  toasty palate with a hoppy finish.  the combination of Amarillo and Tettnag is pretty interesting to taste on this one.  Definately pretty complex flavors due to the unique use of these hops.  Nice long finish.  definately one i will revisit!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
2397,"2004-06-05",3.7,"Clear amber body and soapy off-white head. Aroma of fresh apples, hint of spice and citrus and woody hops. Hoppy and fruit flavor. Malt flavor is on the light side for an amber. Mouthfeel is a little watery without that malty texture but this is still nice and easy drinking.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
2397,"2004-05-30",4.1,"End of May, 2004, Deschutes is now available in Colorado: Mostly clear and deep copper with a nice head and sticky lace. Full palate with a great carbonation level. Rich malts; hint of sweet toffee with big toasty flavors. Burnt, woodsy characteristics give it some real depth. Healthy bitterness and muscular tettnang aromas round things out. Really good beer.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

Flavor is sweet and malty at first then the hops bring on the bitter end. Fairly watery and thin on the palate but still a good red.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"

2397,"2004-05-07",3.4,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2005 This is a decent amber. Pours reddish/orange. Has a floral, earthy grassy, aroma. Flavor is somewhat chewy. Nutty, Toffee, carmel, and sweet malt. Hops make their presence known. I will admit I am not a huge amber fan. But this is good.","Oregon, USA","brewshthereen"
2397,"2004-05-02",4.6,"This beer is underated. A smooth red with great taste. Best on tap, but bottles taste great as well. Spendy but well worth the money.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","beer4president"

2397,"2004-03-31",3.5,"Bottle. Nice reddish amber color - just what you want to see in a 'red ale'- topped by a nice off-white head. Caramel malt aroma. I was surprised at the amount of hops in here. It's well balanced, has a good hop flavor and is a good amber ale (not my usual). Not bad at all.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
2397,"2004-03-23",3.7,"I think the Deschutes brewing generally makes a nice beer. Sure it may not be the best in any one class of beers. However, all of their beers are good. This has been a nice addition to their collection. Good tasting amber ale. I enjoyed my last 6 pack of it.","washougal, Washington, USA","mikebeertaster"
2397,"2004-02-17",4.0,"Dark amber color with big fluffy white head.  Scents of sweet caramel and fruit.  This is an easy drinking beer, light bodied but with lot's of caramel and malt flavors.  A slight tingle of hops in the finish.  I'll have another.","Seattle, Washington, USA","leitrim65"
2397,"2004-02-09",3.8,"Big bountiful white head with an alluring red-copper color. Citrusy  aroma. Balanced very well between the sweetness and spicy flavor. Beer flows well from start to the mild hop finnish  Nice and refreshing.","Queen Creek, Arizona, USA","Steib"
2397,"2004-02-01",3.5,"Pours a dark copper with a small, white head that leaves behind little lacing. Big hop character in the nose, mostly sweet citrus, and some small malts. A slight alcohol presence is detectable as well. Flavors starts out with tangy fruits, then a bit woody with malts smoothing it out till the bitter hop end. Nice and tangy palate that is slightly spicy. Not a bad amber at all.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"
2397,"2004-02-01",3.5,"Pleasant fruity and piney hop aroma.  Brilliant clear copper color, thin off-white head.  Flavor is a smooth blend of spicy hops and caramel malt.

2397,"2004-01-20",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2004 Bottle: A dark amber brew that proves to be a bit malty, a bit hoppy, and a bit chewy.  On first sip you are greeted with a mild piney sweetness & slight hoppiness.  The hoppy sweetness tangles with your tounge, then paints your mouth with its piney/maltiness during the long finish.  A very good amber ale.  Cool new label as well!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"

2397,"2004-01-06",5.0,"This is my new favorite beer!  Deschutes brewery just changed all of their labels, but the quality of the ale is as good as last year's beer.
It is beautiful dark red, with a rich malty after-taste.  Yet it is light enough to enjoy more than one with dinner.  Or lunch.  I have only had it in bottles, but appriciated it so much that I went to the brewery to try Cinder Cone on tap, but they didn't have it in October (since it is a winter beer) but they may have it now.  This is an awsome beer from an awesome brewery - I highly reccomend it.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","sphinx"
2397,"2004-01-05",3.8,"Pretty red color, nice head, and fine lacing.  I tried this beer because it was new, then kept buying it because it was delicious.  This beer invites more and more drinking (is that good?).  At once rich and complex, yet quite crisp and refreshing in its hops and slight biterness.  I'll have another.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
2397,"2003-11-25",4.6,"I had this on tap at the local brew festival--'03.  The Cindercone was the talk of the show.

Red amber with a decent head--small, fine bubbles that left quantities of lace behind.

The taste is hard to describe--it's very different from almost anything I've had.

Rich malt body with complex sweetness, but a massive hop presence that just makes your taste buds tingle.  It's a very bold beer, and not for everyone, but that said.  This was my favorite domestic beer of 2003--It's impressive","Billings, Montana, USA","wulfhere"
2397,"2003-11-09",4.5,"Had heard good things about this brew so I decided to at least try a ""single"" 12 ozer
Lovelly old fashioned raised pattern brown bottle. Label has a picture of a snowboarder..but thats the only bad thing about this beer Poured beer into glass..got a small head which quickly turned into a fine lace..the beer itself is a wonderful deep reddish brown
Wonderful smell of hops in ths just great.
Tastes good a litle bitter ..hoppy of course ..good.
Very drinkable..i will buy this again next year if it comes out again.
I really am blessed living up here in Gods Country ( Oregon) ..so many great breweries!","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
2397,"2003-10-04",4.5,"Mmmm, another example of why I love this brewery...

Awesome bottle with raised hops along the shoulder.

Pours a redish amber. Not much head, though.

The scent is a wonderful cross between hops and malt with a hint of...pine!

The taste is a well balanced hops/malt. The hops aren't Cascade, which suprised me knowing the brewery, they're Eask Kent Goldings and Tettnang. Great mouthfeel, just enough carbonation to cleanse the pallet but not so much for a mouthful of foam.

I could *easily* kill a six-pack of these. I hope there's some left as I will surely be buying more.","Port Orchard, Washington, USA","Gromit"
2397,"2003-08-28",3.8,"Another fine offering from Deschutes. Hoppy, crisp. Definitely a beer you have to be in the mood for, but also a beer you'll find you will crave.","Portland, Oregon, USA","weusebio"

2397,"2003-07-07",3.5,"Dark redish amber, thick slow lacing. Yummy hoppy with slight alcohol aroma. Flavor is unbalanced, almost no malt flavors, spicey though. Palate is sweet and bitter, very decent. Refreshing alternative for ambers with a very modern twist.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
2397,"2003-07-05",3.5,"I was pleasantly surprise and very much enjoyed this one.  Deep amber richness in color, conplex and hoppy in the flavor which has a bit of a cinnamon hint in the finish.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","harlequinn"

2397,"2003-05-23",2.7,"Amber in color with a small and lightly tan head. Aroma is of grapefruit and some pine. The flavor is also a little piney with some hop bitterness and grapefruit. Not too much carbonation with a ligt to medium body.","Portland, Oregon, USA","microdyke"

2397,"2003-04-26",4.1,"This is an absolutely superb brew. It has a beautiful head which it retains well. The aroma is sweet with a hint of toffee. It is very full flavored with a wonderful blend of carmel/toffeeness, and fruitiness.","Pullman, Washington, USA","BarePaw"
2397,"2003-04-15",4.0,"Awesome. Pours a decent amber color with a thick off-white head. The aroma was a gorgeous sweet (sugar, toffee, caramel) grapefruity, citrusy character. The flavor was much of the same, but not nearly as bitter as the aroma would let you expect. Nice crisp, yet creamy feel. I am really impressed with this beer. I think it is a real standout among amber ales.","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"
2397,"2003-04-11",4.0,"This i more akin to an apa than an amber.  Amber bodied with fairly thick head of a nice cream-foam consistency>  Aromatic hop profusion is a delightful surprise.  The flavor was a more diffuse hoppiness with a twinge of malt.  Superb balance and nice, sweet flavor.  Again, I hesitate to label this an amber, but if it is, it is a top fiver.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"

2397,"2003-03-09",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2003 Citrucy with ripe friuty character.  Has a bit of a spicy bite.  Very crisp and cleaned up well. I'm sure I could drink about eight of ten of them.  I've now been drinking this stuff for like 3 months.  Still love it.  I go to the market and pick up a mixed deschutes 6 pack.  Two Cinder COnes, 2 Obsidian Stouts and 2 Black Buttes.  What a knock out combination for six dollars and fifty cents.  The swetness and fruitiness never fail to surprise me.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","GermanBrews76"
2397,"2003-03-06",3.3,"Hmmm...is it just me or does the term ""cinder cone"" lead the consumer to believe that the beer is chock full of malty alchohol warming goodness? Where's the smoldering embers? The flambe de beer? Sufficently douced in cooling hop water I gather. I think the hops do a little more than simply ""balance the toffee sweetness"" here. Very hoppy actually, the malt was very subdued - a bit hidden but kind of complex and definitely tasty. Deschutes adds another hop bomb to the Pacific Northwest amber market.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"
2397,"2003-03-05",3.6,"Now I love ambers and I love Deschutes but this was a let-down. Nice hoppy aroma and flavor with a light head. Skunky aftertaste however.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","herbstress3"

2397,"2003-02-08",3.9,"From the very first Deschutes beer I had several years ago, they have been a favorite brewery, and one that produces a fine line of beers that fit all occasions, and thanks to Liquid Solutions, I once again have a source as mine dried up a couple of years ago.

The pour a crystal clear deep mahogany color, the head extravagant in size, spumous in texture, beige in color and the lace a thick glutinous sheet to meld with the glass. Wonderful floral aromas at the front, malt sweet underneath, citrus crisp and fresh, what a treat for the senses, with the beginning loaded with malt, ambrosial and the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is purposeful in its spicy hop bite, the carbonation moderate, and the aftertaste hop bitter and quite dry. Meant for the Hop Heads, as the hops dominate this beer and that suits me just fine.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
2397,"2003-02-02",3.1,"I expected more from this. A full malty body, but nothing to really back it up. A beer that is capable of so much more. Has the distinctive Deschutes house taste to it. Beautiful dark red color though.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
