94,"2017-05-07",4.2,"12 oz bottle. Quiet pour with moderate carbonation and a delightful blended aroma of whiskey, oak, and spice. The beer is a rich bronze colour with a tan head and ample lace. The smooth start has rich spicy notes including cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice that continue to expand into the middle. The finish is long with oaky whiskey notes lingering. There is a warm alcohol glow at the very end. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth throughout. Good!","Dunbar, Ontario, CANADA","n1940"
94,"2017-04-02",3.9,"The aroma is caramel, cinnamon, rye. Pours a dark cloudy orange/brown, virtually no head and good lacing. The taste is a light sour with a touch of bitter. The body is medium, the texture creamy, the carbonation soft and the finish medium/long. Very interesting, very good.","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","LearninBeer"
94,"2017-03-06",3.7,"Bottle, date stamped September 2016, received as a gift. Pours an ugly, murky light brown with a solid off-white head. The description sounds terrible to me, but I have to say I was wrong. Odd Side really pulled this off. The aroma is sweet, sugary just as expected but its natural and not punishing. The barrel notes are harmonious. Nutmeg comes out and even the genuine starchiness of sweet potato. The mouthfeel is coating and sugary to the point I can taste it on my lips after each sips. Still, its not overly aggressive and pleasant in small doses. Whiskey-soaked sweet potato souffle is a perfect description. The barrel notes make it seem grown-up enough to not be alcho-pop and the spices retain a natural quality. Good spiciness from the rye for balance too. This is not something I would normally request to drink, but it is so well executed for what it is.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
94,"2017-02-21",3.8,"Bottled 09/19/16. Pours dusty copper, off white head. Aroma is cinnamon, clove, maybe banana, not exactly sweet potato, just lots of sweetness, maybe some molasses or syrup, bit of whiskey. Sweet. Flavor is cinnamon, syrup, some whiskey, sugary sweet, sweet potato. Solid.","New York, USA","SG111"
94,"2017-02-14",3.3,"Keg @ GTMW 16. Deep brown pour with a small khaki head. Spicy pumpkin pie mix on the nose. Pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla. Flavor is quite sweet and a bit hot. Chewy caramel and vanilla rocky road. Cinnamon. A bit of boozy heat. Ok for an adjunct-heavy seasonal. Not my bag, really.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
94,"2017-02-12",4.1,"Bottle. Hazy brown with small head. Quite sweet. Brown sugar and bourbon. Light cinnamon and vanilla. Fantastic flavors. Bordering on too sweet, but really hit the right notes for me.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"
94,"2017-01-21",3.8,"Poured from bottle thanks AdamChandler caramel brown with a thin tan head. Aromas of caramel malt sweet potatoe vanilla and spice. Taste is sweet creamy mouth feel and follows aroma lingering cinnamon and spice.","Middleton, Massachusetts, USA","Chalumeaux"
94,"2017-01-21",3.4,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2017 12 oz. bottle, thanks to AdamChandler. Aroma and flavor does resemble a sweet potato. In the flavor the whiskey barrel does not cut the sweetness. Caramel Malt, sweet potato notes, vanilla bean, and lactose sugar make this ridiculously, over-the-top sweet. The flavor is correct for what the Brewer wanted to create BUT.... It is cloying after about 4 ounces. Has to be sampled in very small sample doses. Could never drink the entire bottle","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
94,"2017-01-21",3.8,"12oz bottle acquired in a trade. a reddish brown almost raisin juice looking beer. small head. It smells really good. I get yam, brown sugar, candy corns. it smells like Thanksgiving. Incredibly sweet. I get the cinnamon and brown sugar first then sweet potato, burnt sugar, vanilla finish. dont really get any rye but I imagine a lot of the vanilla is from the barrel.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
94,"2017-01-15",4.5,"Pours a murky brown with a thin white head. Aroma is coconut, vanilla, whiskey, dark fruit, caramel, toffee, and some spices. Flavor is sweet vanilla, coconut, caramel, toffee, whiskey, and hot booze notes. Spices are mostly drowned out, and Im never sure how sweet potato could taste in a beer, but I have no doubt it adds something good. Has a smooth, full body with plenty of carbonation. This is a delicious beer.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","chucklemation"
94,"2017-01-07",4.3,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/19/2016. Pours hazy dark reddish brown color with a small fairly dense off white head with solid retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, sweet potato, spicy rye, toasted pie crust, whiskey, oak, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, sweet potato, spices, and whiskey barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, sweet potato, spicy rye, toasted pie crust, whiskey, oak, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/spice bitterness and rye/whiskey/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, sweet potato, spicy rye, toasted pie crust, whiskey, oak, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, sweet potato, spices, and whiskey barrel flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light dryness from rye/barrel spiciness as well. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly slick/sticky/syrupy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden; a mild warmth lingering after the finish, with zero barrel booziness. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged imperial spiced rye ale. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, sweet potato, spices, and whiskey barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV. Balance between spice, malt, and barrel is pretty much perfect. This delivers all that I expected from the label description. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
94,"2016-12-30",3.6,"Bottle. Clear copper pour with a medium beige head. Aroma of sweet caramel candy and whiskey. Malty and caramelly flavor giving way to cinnamon and ginger before a boozy finish.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
94,"2016-12-15",4.0,"Aroma is sweet potato, caramel, dark fruit, cinnamon, nutmeg, sweet but lovely. Appearance is brown red, light tan head, hazy. Taste is sweet potato, barrel, booze, rye, caramel, nutmeg, cinnamon, good. Mouthfeel is medium body, light carbonation, rye whiskey and sweet potato aftertaste. Overall, much better than expected.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
94,"2016-12-05",3.6,"Bottle. Pours a light brown with an off-white head; in the glass it is a murky brown color. Aromas of rye, cinnamon and fall spices, caramel, slight alcohol. Tastes similar with caramel malt, some light spices, spicy rye flavors, light alcohol. Medium+ sweet that is balanced by the rye spiciness. Medium+ bodied, sticky and almost thick/syrupy, dry finish.","Michigan, USA","Mr_Abner"
94,"2016-12-02",3.8,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate caramel, toffee, vanilla, whiskey, light cinnamon, nutmeg, and a hint of apple. It pours a cloudy dark orangish-brown with a small off-white head that quickly fades to a very thin film outlined by a slightly thicker ring. The flavor starts with moderate creamy caramel and toffee. The finish has light-moderate vanilla, whiskey, coconut, mild apple, alcohol, and hints of cinnamon. Its full bodied with light carbonation and a somewhat sticky mouthfeel.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
