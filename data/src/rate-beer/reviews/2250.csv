With that said, the aroma is sure making my mouth water. And tasting.... tasting... wtf? Pop! Craigmont Pop. Those tiny rockets candy you get at halloween. Powdery weird mix of sourness... a fruity sourness, I also think there is some Lik-Em-Stik flavour as well. So yea - you could say its kinda sweet...

2250,"2007-12-28",3.7,"Rating #1200...
12/28/2007:  Well, I have had this bottle sitting around for awhile now (since I traded for it back in March 2007), so what better time to enjoy it than now?!  ...  St. Louis Permium Faro has a toasted golden color (light honey) and pours quite clear.  It has a tasting creamy off-white head and a moderate amount of carbonation.  I like the aroma.  It has a nice blend of sweetness along with some acidic notes and hints of dry oak/wood, funk, and fermented apples.  Wow!  The flavor starts really sweet and then gives way some delicate sourness with flavors of lightly spiced (cinnamon) red wine, tart apples, and then tons of sugar.  I really like the contrast between the sweet, sour, tart, and acidic flavors.  The lingering flavor on the palate is like a sweet, candy-coated lemon head candy that is sour/acidic on the inside.  The underlying lambic can still be tasted underneath the sugary candi sweetness.  I also like the fact that this beer actually has some body to it and isnt over-carbonated.  It is delicate on the palate and seems to work well for this beer overall.  Amazingly, my wife also enjoyed this beer and called it ""tasty"" which is impressive since there are very few beers she will actually drink!  In my opinion, this beer is under-rated.  I wish that Faro Lambics were more widely available so that I could get it for my wife to enjoy...

Theres a little lambic-like funkiness below the sweet sugary and somewhat spicy nose.  Kind of a cinnamon and cloce combination.  Flavor is very sugary sweet up front fading to a pixie stick laced finish.  Just the slightest hint of funk present.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly sticky sugary finish.  Soft light carbonation.  This was what it was, on par with the Chapeau Faro I had previously, and by far the worst of the 4 Faros that I had in this session.

Not really pleasing at all, and a clear disappointment.  Perhaps it would work well if it was really cold outside, or something, I dont even know.

Auch im Vergleich zu Referenzbieren dieser Brauart fällt der überaus zurückhaltende Geruch auf, der zwar ebenfalls säuerliche Aspekte aufweist, aber nur sehr schwach auftritt und den gesüssten Momente Vorrang gewährt. Jedoch vermittelt der Geruch nur einen Bruchteil der Süsse, der wirklich in dem Bier enthalten ist. Der erste Schluck steckt von Antrunk bis Abgang voll mit Kandiszucker, welcher jedoch zu künstlich erscheint.

2250,"2003-12-20",1.5,"Clear orange coloured, medium head. Very sweet syrup aroma. Sweet flavour, finishes a bit more sour. Practically pure syrup, not good.","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"
2250,"2003-12-20",1.8,"Clear orange golden color, medium white head. Aroma of sweet gueuzes, not oaky at all but you can just smell the sugar. Taste is extremely sweet of sugar with a bit tartness. Sticky palate, like coca-cola.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
