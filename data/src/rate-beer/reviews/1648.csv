1648,"2013-10-03",3.4,"A misplaced, so very belated review noted during a pub crawl in Oak Park, IL. very early in the season.(late Feb.) Served to plastic by Matt on the outdoor patio of the Marion St. Cheese Market, so any expressive aroma & flavor notes were a bit diminished by the cold atmosphere, and subsequently, very cold beer. Displayed a black/brown color, with a modest layer of frothy, brownish tan head foam. The aroma was roasty, with some bakers chocolate, and a hint of burnt wood & smokiness. Medium bodied, with soft carbonation, the flavor contributed fair malt content, some mild astringency, and moderate, slightly earthy hop bitterness. A decent, even tempered Stout.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
