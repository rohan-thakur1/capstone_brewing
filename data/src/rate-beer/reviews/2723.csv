2723,"2016-04-25",3.0,"Pours pale straw with a nice floral aroma. The taste is something really different from what Ive experienced with other beers. The savion hops bring a white wine taste along with floral and fruity notes, quite nice! The only real let down for me was it is over carbonated for my liking. Quite fizzy...

2723,"2016-03-10",3.5,"Pours a crystal clear pale straw gold with a good head of white foam. The aroma shows nice sauvin white grape, biscuity lager malt, a hint of general fruitiness. The taste is very clean, grainy, fruity hop. Its light on the feel, but flavour alludes to a higher than average ABV. Its crisp and refreshing, not too dry, nicely carbonated.

2723,"2012-08-07",3.5,"A-- Poured a light straw color. Half inch head with good retention and very carbonated.

S-- Took a good minute or 2 for the beer to open up. Once it did I got a decent floral smell. Nothing real strong but is there. Also a bit sweet, like pineapple and mango sweetness. Once the beer opens up a bit it does go from floral to fruity.

T-- Not a lot really. Fairly neutral I thought. Got a floral taste in the end but not a whole lot else. A little bit of bitterness, or grassy taste from the hops but very neutral.

M-- Well carbonated and fairly lively. Much more hoppy than malty to me, even though it does have a little bit of biscut sweetness in it. Does get grassy in the end and it is a bit of a turn off to me. Would have rather have the sweetness than a bitter end to the beer. Or the other way around.

D-- Not my style, to be up front. Only one is sufficient. I really liked the sweetness in the smell and wish this was more fruit forward. Would be pretty good then.

Pours a brigt yellow-gold with a billowing white head that tries to linger before fading. Lychees, honey, fruity flowers and lemony herbs on the nose .  Thorough malt profile, cleanly fermented, throws out just a little hop fruitiness but its not as overt as most NZ craft lagers. Weighty, sweet and clean. Creamy mouthfeel.  Then... wow... a long steely bitterness releases late herbal hop flavours remind me of rosemary, mint and aniseed. No wonder so many people are scared of Sauvin, this beer really showcases its intensity.  What at first seems like a Dortmunder Export gives way to an firmly bitter new world Pilsner. Ill be interested to see what else comes out of these guys.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","yalnikim"

2723,"2007-04-11",4.2,"A saggy old pale ale I sup upon typing this, brewed with those good time mates Willamette and Cascade, but it just doesnt cut right now against a new, more stylish and chic friend Id love to call my own. I downed a few bottles of this weeks ago - not satisfied at one - and I swear the flavour and bouquet still lingers strongly in my mind. It pours a pale-yellow gold, not exactly bright but it twinkles lustrously off the lights. Carbonation is fine, very fine, well lagered, well conditioned. Head develops well off the pour, a nice, level, thick pad of white that holds arms and never lets go, daubing well as the beer recedes to empty. Ooooh, exotic  is this aroma that wafts, sends me tizzy! All pear drops, grapefruit, rose petals, and a big whack of passionfruit, fresh-pulped. A little wheat softens it (I dont know if wheat was even used, but I got an inkling?). A wine maker, I swear there is even notes of Riesling in there that tickles on end, a little spice perhaps. All fruit in the mouth, lagering has not reduced this or stricken this of any fruity esteric delight. The palate is light, very creamy and sultry. Passionfruit is dominant again here as does some grapefruit and pine notes play edging at US hop-like characteristics. Quite juicy it oddly seems supple and dry mid-palate before heating up again as it drifts into darkness. Cracked pepper, rose petal bite makes use of the saliva glands, giving a good edge to it, the swallow all fruit, slightly sweet and mildly vinous with a good linger of pine adding more fuel to the furnace. This is just all class, stylish from bottle to glass. Beautifully balanced, bountifully aromatic and equally flavoursome, a truly nice drop. A surprise, so extra points for that!!!  I need me a few pounds of Sauvin. (33cL, The Beer Store Morley)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Bouquet is choco-block full of passion fruit abd grassy herbal notes. As others have rightly observed very wine / sav blanc like (minus the sweaty notes sometimes found in Kiwi savvys).  Overt fruit notes drop off in the mouth but are more than adequartely replaced with floral fruits / hops and a firming, bitter finish.  Very different and really does push the fruit / floral aromas very well.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"

This was crisp and refreshing, which i guess is what most people making lager are trying to achieve, however, this was a little different. This had some wonderful fruit punch sort of flavours. Some kiwifruit and goosberry in here, which instantly draws comparisons with NZ Sauvignon Blanc even though it is indeed a beer. This was fresh and fruity, and it just seems made for a hot summers day in Australia.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"

This is one of the best Aussie lagers Ive ever had, if not the best.  Strange melony, guava, grapefruit & grass notes on the nose.  Pours slightly green with a fluffy white head.  The flavour has loads more of that fruit - melon, grapefruit and underripe mandarin.  It presents a refreshing, long, dry and hoppy finish.

Pale gold body with seemingly minimal head and lace. Bit of a light grainy backbone of pale malt supporting the tropical fruit driven hop flavorus. A herbaceous note also makes its presence.

2723,"2006-12-31",3.4,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2007 Wow, its about time Australia produced a decent NZ-style lager, those Kiwi hops seem really well-suited to good, distinctive lagers, even though they can get a bit funky for my tastes. Very pale and very clear with pretty patchy head retention. Initial aroma is like LCPA if it were brewed in NZ - floral lychees and Nivea hand cream like LC with lemon pepper, kiwi fruit, an odd hint of treacle and some other raunchy NZ hop stuff. The aromas really strong actually... in both senses of the word. I dont particularly see the sauvignon blanc comparison. I suppose it has a bit of a white grape aroma, but sav blancs dont have that. Malt flavour is pretty limp, a touch sweet, thin and papery, lacking somewhat in both quality and quantity (esp. at the higher ABV) Id say. Its all drowned out in a mass of hop flavour anyway, which isnt as impressive as the aroma. Its kind of weedy and awkward, with a really awkward prickly, almost chemical note that I cant really describe. At normal hopping levels it probably wouldnt be an issue but the hop flavour is so obvious here that it gets quite rough. Its not bitter, in fact the finish is quite weak, but theres so much hop flavour that it more than balances the malt. Its weird though, when you start drinking it this beer seems amazing, but the more you delve into it the less fun it becomes. Perhaps its the disproportionately large hop flavour, or the lack of quality malt, but by the end of a glass you arent exactly tearing off to the fridge to grab another bottle, and the more I drink it the more obvious its flaws become. That said, this is a really impressive beer, and quite unique in the Australian scene, especially considering its wide distribution. Top marks for doing something interesting - hopefully theyll do some more quality lager styles too.RR: Drank the last couple of bottles I had from the bottle itself and there was something decidedly dodgy about it. I suspect it is actually the hops, but it gave the impression of something much worse. Weird.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"
2723,"2006-12-26",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2007 Clear pale yellow with a fluffy white head that left minimal lacing. Aroma of passionfruit and some grainy malt, with some obvious parallels with a fruity white wine. The flavour is quite sweet to start, with a noticable hop bitterness coming through after swallowing. Fairly standard on the palate with an even carbonation, creamy texture and medium body. Quite a well constructed beverage, but it doesnt really inspire me to reach for another. Re-rate: Well, it certainly does vary a bit in quality. Half of the bottles Ive had have been good, and the other half very good. Its a shame the quality is temperamental, but when its on song its a lovely lager, somewhat like a bottom fermented LCPA. Fruity and creamy with a lip-smacking satisfaction.

2723,"2006-12-23",3.4,"A really intriguing beer, but why would a winemaker turn his hand to making beer if it just going to taste like wine?? The aroma is so strongly similar to sauv blanc and the palate so light and sweet that it is difficult to believe that it doesnt contain wine, in fact, with its sharply sparkling character and lack of any lasting head, I am convinced it does! 
Its a bit too sweet to be truly refreshing but its fairly well made and an intertesting display of the nelson sauvin hop character none the less.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Linc"
2723,"2006-12-14",3.3,"Poured from bottle. 
Found the first two sips to be quite metallic, I think this was aided by the carbonation which was a bit full on. The malt is the instant taste, but after this the grape taste is very overpowering. 
Nice for about half the bottle, however eventually I found the after taste similar to the non-alcoholic wines you can get from the supermarket...
A nice beer, but I would be tempted to almost say this is a wine cooler disguising itself in some respects. I would drink it again - but it wont be filling my shelves of my fridge as a regular session beer.","Melbourne (Prev: Chch, NZ), AUSTRALIA","MOFO"
2723,"2006-12-05",2.9,"despite the nelson sauvin this is still a ""premium lager"" - a sweet grainy lager with aroma hops but not much bitterness. lovely floral hops in the aroma, with a bit of malt. the head fizzles away immediately which i think is a grave flaw. in the mouth, obviously quality malt used - pleasant honeyish malt flavour. quite full bodied for a lager. main impression is sweetness though, and not very complex. finishes dry with a bit of green high-alpha bitterness. alcohol evident. this is slick but just too sweet. the combination of sweetness and fruity tanginess puts me in mind of an old-style riesling (like one out of a cask that is). now give me a beer!","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
2723,"2006-12-04",3.7,"Bottle: Lots of good things are being said about this lager, so I was looking forward to seeing how it shaped up. I was also interested to see how the Nelson Sauvin hop presents as I had not tasted it before. Put simply, this is a lovely Pale Lager.Crystal clear gold (probably the clearest beer I have ever seen) with a very short-lived white head. It looks like white wine in the glass as not a trace of any head remains. In the nose... Well, my first reaction was ""mmmmmmmmm"". Initially this was just delightful; pears and passionfruit with golden grains. As it opened some fleshy grape notes emerged (hence the hop name I imagine), though after a few minutes it dulled a little. In the mouth a very nicely done fruity, herbal hop flavour dominates over a pleasant slightly sweet sticky-though-not-cloying resinous chord and some juicy malts. Very nice and harmonised very well indeed. The bitterness and carbonation are blanaced but sharp and work excellently I tohught. Fabulous example that good wine-making experience can produce excellent beer.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Aarleks"

2723,"2006-11-21",4.3,"As with many others the term premium lager and the winery source had me feeling very sceptical. Add to this the presentation and you can hear the wine drinkers voices waxing lyrically and condescendingly about how good it is to drink a proletariat bevvy once in a while. WRONG, WRONG WRONG. From the moment this is poured there is a feeling that this one has broken the mould. Very pale body and creamy head but the crispness and herbaceousness of the nose are readily present. The slightly higher ABV does seem to give this a degreee of oiliness in the glass which does not disappoint when savoured. The mouthfeel is thicker than the typical premium lager which, together with the muted carbonation, also lends itself to the comparison with a good dry white wine. This is a delightful beer from start to finish. For bulk sales this is marketed in a 16 pack, 4x4 rather than the common 6x4. Perhaps this is due to the price point which allows the carton to retail for around $53. Not cheap but this is not your typical swilling beer anyway. After all, it is a premium lager.","Potts Point, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA","Sully"
2723,"2006-11-17",4.0,"Is this a beer of a semi sauv blanc? I was a bit skeptical of a winery producing a beer, but whammo!! The end to end on this is brilliant, packaging is neat and classy and the pour was very smooth. I could liken the pour to the sound of a Mercedes door closing, you dont know why it is classy, it just is.
The aroma is huge on this, a range of floral notes and tropical fruits and this follows through to the palate finishes with a nice subtle bitterness.
For those that say that Beer isnt evolving, then this is proof that there is room for originality and raising the bar. I hope this stays in production since ive found my Summer beer.

2723,"2006-11-15",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 16, 2006 Nice to see an Australian brewer muscle in on the emerging fruity lager market that the Kiwis seemed to have cornered in this part of the world. Interesting that it took a winemaker to break this ground. This isnt quite up to the standard set by NZs Emersons Pilsner, but its good enough to be a future regular in my fridge. Its clear gold and poured with a tall shaving foam lather, good lace and good length. The Sauvin hop used here takes its name from sauvignon blanc and this is indeed remarkably wine-like. (Your views on sauvignon blanc will be a fair indicator as to how much youll enjoy this - Im a fan.) The aroma is very green and acidic, with strong gooseberry notes, passionfruit and lychee. This is full flavoured, with a big initial fruit explosion - passionfruit and lychee, again. Theres enough malt to carry through the mid-palate to a tart, quenching finish. Good bitterness. At 5.6% abv, this is a strong lager by local standards but theres no hint of alcohol in the flavour. The carbonation is very soft, verging on underdone but pretty much perfect for these winey flavours.   This isnt an everyday session lager any more than sauvignon blanc is an everyday wine. This will pair well with food  - a lemon and thyme risotto or anything with subtle citric flavours, for example. The packaging and marketing mark this down as that most ghastly of creations, a ""premium"" beer. But unlike, say Moorilla Estates pale ale, this is good enough to get away with it. Its not often I finish a new lager and regret not having placed another couple in the fridge. Big thumbs up. (330ml bottle from Liquor on Parade, Kingsford.
