551,"2014-10-26",2.9,"Appearance: Its a hazy brown colored body with a thick fluffy creamy khaki head that stands for a long time. Its a very beautiful looking beer in the glass. The head really accents the beer nicely. It doesnt produce much lacing.

Aroma: Alcohol...Its right up front on the nose. The beer is only 8.2% ABV and it doesnt do a very good job of hiding it. There is a light ""bakery"" scent to it...kind of like cookies...but not sweet or artificial. Its not that strong of a scent. Not much going on in the nose really.

Taste: Alcohol flavor, with some light caramel that coats the tongue and slowly increases the caramel flavor in the mouth as drinking this beer continues. There is a light hint of banana chips in the background, but very light on overall Belgian yeast character.

Mouthfeel: It has a good presence in the mouth. The beer is smooth and the alcohol gives it a faint warming sensation. Good carbonation. Very easy to drink.

Overall: Its a decent enough Dubbel if you have that Belgian Abbey Ale craving, but it doesnt quite meet the mark when it comes to some of the more diverse flavors that are available on the market. I wouldnt say ""dont drink it"" because is is a lovely beer. It just feels like a beer that was hurried or something.","","teromous"

The appearance was a simply splendid amber colored beauty with a soft, tan pillowy head. It seems evenly medium-bodied on the tongue with perfect carbonation. The taste up front was slightly sweet and spicy in the licorice sense but then it quickly dries out once it get to the back of your tongue and upon swallowing. Endlessly fascinating.

551,"2014-05-19",4.2,"Transfer from BA review conducted 2-17-12 - 
Served on tap in a chalice shaped glass

Appearance  A deep red color with a bit of a haze. The head is off white and nice and billowy. It fades to give some lacing.

Smell  The smell is of sweet malt and some nice yeast. Caramel malt and dark fruits of cherries, and raisins, dominate the aromas. There are also nice notes of yeast cake, banana, and a bit of citrus mixed with spices, that are hard to pin down, but very nice indeed. At the very end of the aroma there is a hint of the alcohol rounding out the sweet aromas quite well.

Taste  The taste is fruity and malty just as the nose let on. Fruit flavors are up front and the most prevalent among the taste. The dark fruit flavors are quite strong and soon mix with a strong bready backbone. The spices slowly work their way in with the alcohol and some caramel and tropical fruit flavors, which collectively finish off the taste, and leave quite a pleasant flavor residing in the mouth. 

Mouthfeel  The body is of moderate complexity with a nice level of carbonation. It coats the mouth but is light and very drinkable. 

Overall  This is a very tasty and enjoyable brew. It has great Belgian style qualities and is one nice Dubbel.","","Darkmagus82"

The appearance had a dark brown body yielding a one finger white foamy head that slowly died over a period of five minutes into a film that slowly dissipated into small islands over top the body, really nice to watch.
The smell had lots of fruit up front such as plum, pear and apple. Some light malts enter in along with some super light Belgian yeast.
The taste was really sweet between the previously mentioned flavors adding in a bit of caramel and raisin.

551,"2013-12-27",4.4,"Poured into a Chimay trappist glass. Nice malty, fruity aromas. Very similar to the Chimay red. Very nice head, dark amber to brown malt colored with some lacing. Head dissipates as flavors improve. Somewhat sweet with a bitter aftertaste and reminiscent of the Chimay red. Full body flavor with some mild carbonation but somewhat thick on the tongue. I enjoyed this brew.. Definitely a great version of the Abbey Dubbel. I prefer the Chimay but this matches the Westmalle Dubbel in my book.","New Jersey, USA","Yumzies"

A: Pours a honey brown ale with good clarity. Three fingers of peanut head falls to a quilt of the same over several minutes. Cobweb lacing.

S: Bananas, coriander, yeast. Pretty sweet and simple nose profile here. Its not really impressive. Pretty simple and sweet.

T: Really alcoholic upfront to me. Then plenty of sweet malts, raisin, copper, and hints of nutty yeast. Again, nothing special. A bit too much sweetness again, really one dimensional. Hints of cardboard (oxidation) in here as well.

M: Medium on thin for the style and relatively high carbonation in the style as well. Nice slick finish.

O: I could really take or leave this one. Its far from the best dubbel Ive had, and it is (IMO) more sweet and one dimensional with the sweetness level.

551,"2013-08-10",3.7,"I begin by confessing that I am an unabashed and unrepentant beer snob. That said, this is a fine beer. The issue is that I had something in mind when I purchased it and this ale is a bit different. Having been introduced to Trappist ales and cheese by a friend from Belgium, I have a little bias. This friend also introduced me to home brewing about 30 years ago. Comparing this Dubbel to my reference standard, Chimay Dubbel, is not a fair contest. Chimay is the Ferrari of Belgium Ales. I liked the design and choice of bottles. Thats a great start. The color and head were nice too. But the body is less malty and complex, and this is definitely a lower gravity brew than what I expected. It also lacks the phenols and esters characteristic of European Trappist and similar ales. The characteristic flavor imparted by Trappist yeast is barely discernable. My guess is the brewmaster has chosen a milder ale yeast or has chosen a lower temperature fermentation and has lost the benefit of having used a Trappist ale yeast, or both. The flavors we expect from this style of beer are produced by specific yeast strains working on wert at warmer fermentation temperatures. I have brewed several Trappist style Dubbels and Tripels, as well as some high gravity ales using German wheat beer yeast, such as Weihenstephen yeast. I am surprised how similar the Weihenstephen yeast is to the Trappist yeasts and experiments using this German wheat beer yeast come out very much like sme of my favorite Trappist ales. Having now finished two glasses I must say that some fruity (perhaps cherry) flavors have finally emerged from this brew. I think they could alter the recipe by supplementing the mash with 25 to 35% more malt, add in some Carmel malts and perhaps Belgium rock candy often used to bump up the gravity of this style of beer. Changing the variety of yeast and or temperature of fermentation would likely impart some of the wilder favors and aromas of this style. However, my opinion is mine alone. I will go back to purchasing Chimay. This is a fine brew, but is not what I expected. The enemy of good is perfect. Chimay is perfection. This is very good.","Franktown, Colorado, USA","RickReallyBrew"

The beer is crimson colored with an inch of lasting beige head. The aroma brings toffee, fruit, cherries, yeast, malt. The flavor offers a sweet, fruity, yeasty character with cherries atop a malty base. The beer is medium bodied and really smooth on the palate. Overall, a very good example of the style.

551,"2012-11-15",4.0,"New Yorks Brewery Ommegang brews authentic Belgian style beers exclusively, but manages to make them a bit more drinker-friendly all around. Their Abbey Ale is their flagship beer and for good reason - it has all the makings of a Belgian dubbel but without the acquired taste you often need to drink and appreciate a beer of this type.

I poured a 12oz bottle dated 27 June 2012 into a chalice (I left the yeast in the bottle).

Appearance: Beautiful dark chestnut mahogany hue thats almost dark purple. Forms a large, fluffy, tan foaming head which is slow to dissipate and leaves a continuous coating of head and minor lacing on the glass.

Smell: Dark fruits, especially prunes or raisins with hints of spices, but still mild.

Taste: Ommegang Abbey Ale describes was inspired by the Trappist dubbel style and one sip into it you can tell this is true. Much like a Chimay Red or a Rochefort 6 its a soft, but complex palate of dark fruits and light bitterness. What makes this brew unique and (for lack of a better word), Americanized, is its use of spices: coriander, sweet orange peel, star anise, licorice root, and cumin. Youd think that would make for a spice bomb, but this beer is surprisingly calm in its delivery. 

Light malty sweetness up front with a taste of dark fruits, but also bready at the same time (fruitcake?). Dry bitterness through the middle which then finishes with a gentle alcohol warmth and even sweeter fruity taste on the finish. The spices are not individually distinguishable, though thats fine because I think this beer is meant to be about the homogenization effect and they all blend well together. Strong enough to create for an interesting, delectable palate, but still calm enough not to make it liquid potpourri. This is an ideal starter Belgian-style beer, yet good enough to be appreciated by connoisseurs.

Drinkability: When I first poured the bottle it created a large amount of foam which had me concerned it would be a carbonation explosion in the mouth. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was a soft, gentle mouthfeel that was very smooth going down. It does leave a somewhat dry, pasty aftertaste, but its easily tolerable. At 8.2% ABV Ommegang Abbey Ale would seem pretty hefty, but its nothing close to a weighty, obese brew. The subtle alcohol warmth is welcoming here.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
551,"2012-11-13",2.9,"Sour smelling and tasting, a little sweet. Ruddy brown in color. Much fizzier than I expected, with a long finish - carbonation overpowers the flavor a bit.  Bitter in the back of the throat, but not overwhelmingly so.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","rnlanders"

Smell is a light and wafting mixture of light yeast, complex fruit (elements of fig, grape, and cherry), and sweet honey and caramel. Notable for its complete lack of banana character. Flavor is a rich, complex layering of fruit, sweet sugars, and hints of candied licorice and chocolate with weaving traces of yeast notes. There is initially a caramel honey malt base, which is followed by gradual injections of fruit notes before arriving at the fruity belly full of deep fig, date, and cherry. This follows through into a rich finish with hints of assorted sweets -- candied fruit, toffee, chocolate, and licorice. Palate is thick and moderately sticky with a brisk champagne-like initial carbonation. An exceptional brew.","Oxford, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Shakesbeere"
551,"2012-02-05",3.9,"Sweet candied and ripe fruit aroma rising off a slightly murky red/orange body with a quickly dissipating light tan head.   Bing cherries and ripe plum flavors hit first followed by a caramel and toffee sweetness.  The body gets creamy as the sip progresses giving it an almost milky texture and flavor.  There is some earthy bitterness to balance all this sweetness along with a light Belgian yeast character.  The alcohol finally shows itself ever so slightly near the end, but even then the 8.5% ABV doesnt seem possible its so well hidden.  An aftertaste of candied fruit is left along with a surprising light taste of buttered popcorn.  A delicious and well made Belgian style beer.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"

The aroma has a wonderfully fragrant combination of wine grapes, candied plums, and dark brown sugar. The flavor is likewise rich and complex, with notes of leather, rum-soaked cherries, raisins, brown sugar, and some deep underlying earthiness. The fine, active carbonation creates a texture that is both prickly and creamy.

In my trappist chalice, this beer looks just beautiful! Aroma is smooth raisiny dark fruit tones with lots of dark malts in the back. Taste is raisins, salty licorice (nice combo!) dark fruits and hints of red grape peel and dark candy sugars.

551,"2011-07-11",3.0,"Appearance - Pours a dark amber color into a snifter. A lot of carbonation with this beer compared with other quadrupels. About one and a half fingers of head. Heavy stickage to the side of the glass as it is swirled around.

Smell - Malty and slightly sweet smell. Some dried fruit and earthy notes. 

Taste - Not as impressed as with some quadrupels I have had. Maybe it is because I have tried several quadrupels now (and am not used to Dubbels), but I feel as if this beer is just attempting to copy the other (better) quadrupels out there. I taste heavy malt taste that is not very sweet as all (despite the fact that my mouth and glass lip are sticky by the end of the tasting). Also in there are some dried fruits and earthy notes. Maybe some star of anise as well.

Mouthfeel - Not too heavily bodied as to be overpowering. Despite there being a lot of carbonation on the pour you cannot taste too much of it in your mouth (a good thing for me). 

Overall - What can I say? Maybe I have become a quadrupel snob with the likes of Westvleteren 12 and Rochefort, but I like a sense of sweetness and fruit in my beer. This just feels like a semi-good imitation beer. Really cannot tell the big difference between a Quadrupel and Dubbel.","Florida, USA","ajcobb24"

T - Similar to the aroma with lots of spiced dark fruit with a bit of a rum soaked taste and burnt candi sugar. Some yeasty taste comes out. Fair amount of apple and orange as well. Caramel and burnt toffee malt. Some cinnamon, pepper and clove along.

M - Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty smooth and slick.

D - Decently drinkable. A bit on the spicy and burnt to really want to drink a lot. Alcohol is fairly well hidden.

Notes: Overall a decent beer, pretty big flavors with a good amount of spice, burnt and rum flavors that make it a bit strong. Not my favorite for the style, but not a bad beer overall.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Id agree with that, but the problem is, if I wanted burgundy, Id buy a bottle of WINE, no t this.  I had a few sips of it and started using it for cooking.  I can imagine some of you now laughing at me, but I dont care.  Thats all its good for, except for one thing: more than any other beer Ive tried, it goes well with pasta and tomato sauce.

The flavor begins with toasted malts and caramel followed by toffee, dates, doughy yeast, raisins and rum. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and silky smooth with medium carbonation.

551,"2010-04-21",4.1,"A- Murky medium brownish red body that pours with thick creamy light tan head. Head eventually fades to 1/2 finger and has perfect retention. Little to no lacing is left behind in the glass because it seems to heavy to stick to the sides. When held up to the light the red in this brew shimmers through its dense fogginess.

S- Licorice, subtle spice (mostly clove), fig, caramel, toffee, alcohol, and hints of cinnamon and dark fruit. Interesting and complex combination that seems to mold well together.

T- The cinnamon and clove fight with sweet plum and caramel malt for dominance upfront. A hint of toffee can be detected also. A big dose of licorice and hops arise for the finish and add to the complexity of the flavor that is already present. Lots of cinnamon lingers along with hints of caramel malt and a blanket of alcohol warmth.

P- Medium carbonation with a medium weight body that is smooth, creamy, soft, and easy to swallow.

O- This is an excellent and complex brew by Ommegang. It has sour, sweet, smooth, and spicy characteristics that blend together very well. The 8.5% is not hidden here-and my 12 oz bottle was plenty for one sitting. I will have this one again-as Ommegang has become one of my favorite breweries. I still have a bomber 3 Philosophers left in my fridge and I am looking forward to trying it. Then I shall move on to Chocolate Indulgence.

Alcohol is present, but does not over power the good smells.

The palate is medium bodies and finishes dryer than you would predict with the sweetness.  Overall, this is among the very best dubbels that I will definitely get again.

pilsner malt base, yields some strong alcohols and a bit of lime juice. 

Odd. Prickly. The flavor profile isnt particularly wonderful. A sharp, 

biting metallic flavor, with overly strong, unbalanced alcohols. Ends a

Smell is a pungent Belgian aroma with the addition of dark cherries. The fruit is light, however. The malt is dark and roasted. Plenty of bread-like yeast. A bit musty but appropriately so.

Heavy burst of alcohol, followed by a bittersweet combination of dark caramel and sweet berries. Nutty at the bottom, but darkly sweet on top. Some dark chocolate. Sugary sweet as it warms.

551,"2009-09-04",4.6,"I had my first Ommegang Abbey Ale and was very happy I did so. An outstanding Belgian style ale, made in New York as the bottle said 3600 miles from Belgium.

A malty strongly flavored beer (as you would expect from any Belgian Dubbel), with rich dark cherry and plum flavors.

The balance of flavors is outstanding, and these flavors are further enhanced by a clean dry finish

This is a top 10 beer for me.","New Jersey, USA","njmoons"
551,"2009-09-01",4.0,"This seemed like an exceptional deal at $5.50 per 750ml bottle and I liked Hennepin so here I am. I poured this into a snifter but I bet a wine glass would have worked as well. The color is the darkest red I have ever seen but not quite brown. The head is a craggy rocky fortress of cream-colored bubbles. The smells are like squeezed grapes, wine, alcohol, raisins and I find myself sniffing away as I sip. The flavor is strong, some raisins, long aftertaste of licorice and a slight tinge of alcohol. I think the mouthfeel is really smooth but the beer does coat your mouth thoroughly. The alcohol starts rearing its beautiful head towards the end of the first glass and by the end of the bottle I feel like dying. I drank this while listening to the new 9th Wonder album: Dream Merchant Vol. 2, you should too.

Smells of bananas! Much different than the other dubbels that I have tried. Not that this is a bad thing at all. Swirling the glass reveals some more traditional malt scents.

Taste is a bit drier up front than other dubbles I have had, and unfortunately Im not a fan. Much less sweet than the Westy or Bernadus dubbels, more dark fruit. Closer in taste to their quads.

Mouthfeel is good, very light bodied and pretty heavily carbonated. Leaves quite the dry aftertaste.","Donora, Pennsylvania, USA","Sonicdescent"

551,"2009-08-11",4.3,"I broke this beer out at a barbecue the other day to show one of my neighbors what real beer is, needless to say he put down his Miller Lite and wanted to drink my entire bottle. Brewery Ommegang was started in 1997 in a traditional Belgium style farmhouse located four miles south of Cooperstown, New York. Demand became so overwhelming that in 2003 Brewery Ommegang was sold to the Belgium brewery responsible for Duvel Golden Ale and now Ommegang brews are made both in Belgium and Cooperstown. This particular brew is made in Belgium is the first beer produced by Ommegang and was inspired by the ales produced by the Belgium Trappist monks. This beer pours nicely into a dark red brown color with a nice fat foamy head. The aromas are full of Belgium yeast as well as some fruity and nutty notes. The palate is full and robust with breadiness that dissipates to fruitiness as you reach the exquisite finish.","Centennial, Colorado, USA","WhatNewinBooze"

551,"2009-07-14",4.0,"Pours a clear, dark copper brown with a 1 finger (chalice) creamy beige head that has great retention (45 minutes and counting) and leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is apple skin, woody notes, dark fruit, caramel, cider vinegar, light toasted grain and some floral sweetness, more sweet grain and licorice come out as it warms. Flavor is sweet grain, toasted wheat bread, sweet floral notes, a hint of dark fruit and anise cookies up front. Toward the middle some tart red apple, cider vinegar, woody notes, faint tart cherries and lots more anise comes out. The finish is hinting at roast, a little espresso, stale coffee and hints of balsamic vinegar. As it warms the flavor loses a little of its vinegar tartness and takes on a more herbal/dark fruit tone. Palate is thin, to medium bodied with a chewy entry that is quickly thinned out by a blanket of sharp-not too sharp-carbonation and ends with an nice dry palate ready for another sip. Really great dubbel, probably the most interesting dubbel I have tried in recent memory. Really the change from serving it at fridge temp to nearly room temp make it a great sipper, though for all of its complexity, nothing really pushed it over the top.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

Poured out a very large light brown head, lots of foamy head, so-so lacing with great retention, reddish brown. The aroma is very interesting and Im instantly reminded of a flemmish sour. There is definetely that quality here - cherries, dark something, yeasty impression, slightly sour, licorice, prunes, flemmish sour. The taste is exceptional - lots of sour yeast, cherries, lots more of spicy yeast, dark toasted malts, low amount of oak, mild malts, more licorice and more very dark malts bitterness if that makes any sense at all. Brown sugar is prominent when warmer. Nice spice that mixes well with the bitter finish - a finish that does not linger terribly long. Pretty smooth, yeasty leftovers, dark malts, nice finish.

A bit of alcohol too which maybe disturbes a bit, but overall filling and quite smooth on the palate with soft carbonation. Overall a very good interpretion of an Abbey Dubbel from an american brewery (from what Ive tasted before american interpretation of belgian beer can have a bit of too much american hops which doesnt really fit in).

551,"2009-01-25",3.0,"I definitely acknowledge that Ommegang makes some of the best Belgian style beer in North America; although this one fell a bit short of my expectations.  Compared to the Westmalle dubbel, Chimay, and several others, I thought the comparison to be unfavorable.

The beer poured an attractive red-brown haze with good head formation.  Aroma was decently intense, with lots of caramel, and with some very under-stated dried fruit.  Flavor had a lot of what seemed to me off notes - a weird cerealness and several others I couldnt quite place.  This seemed to improve as I worked my way through the glass.  By the end of the glass, the off-notes had subsided (or Id stopped noticing them), and i was left to enjoy a flavor that was more caramel-y than I wouldve liked, with less the wine, dried fruit, and maltiness that Ive come to associate with other dubbels.

I thought this was OK, and it is one of the few bargains remaining in the craft beer aisle of Discount Liquor, but Id still be reluctant to recommend.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

Nose is beautiful - raisins and brown sugar, a bready malt character from the dark sweetness and the yeast, and even a bit of acidic sweetness that reminds me of red grapes. One of the best smelling dubbels out there in my opinion. Taste begins with some sparkling carbonation, adding a dryness to the  raisin, brown sugar, and tangy yeast that come next. Finish is long, with quite a bit of yeast and a very subtle, dry, roasty presence. Mouthfeel is full, striking a nice balance between fluffy and sparkling carbonation. A really nice take on the style, though I would like to see just a shade more sweetness and a hair less tangy yeast. Probably the best smelling dubbel out there though.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","JohnQPublic"

12 oz bottle given to me by my friend Brent. Poured into my Ename Abbaye chalice, served between 45-50 degrees.  Pour is slight haze burgundy ruby brown with a one inch tan head that falls with noisy carbonation bubbles.  Aroma is thick malt, with dried fruit (plum and cherry) sweetness.  Behind the malt is a nice vanilla and spice yeast that fills out and softens the sweetness of the nose.  The taste is sharply sweet (again the dried fruit) initially, then moving beyond that to more of an earthy straw maltiness.  The yeast picks up in the back, and this time is strong on the spice - clove and cinnamon.  The flavors lack amplitude, and really jut out in a number of directions.  There really is none of the softness of the nose.  Palate is medium bodied, mouth coating, which is lifted by active fine carbonation.  As it warms, the heat of the alcohol becomes apparent.  An OK take on an Abbey style, though lacks the integration of the classics.  Thanks for leaving this behind, Brent.  (8,4,6,3,14 - 3.5)

Mild carbonation. Nose is a little thin but still there is some unsweet chocolate, raisins, alcohol, red licorice, toffee. Taste is nicely balanced. Medium to thin on the palate. Aftertaste is dry with notes of nutty malt and unsweet chocolate that lingers. Overall like a stout and abbey dubbel combined.

Delicious woody aftertaste, just bitter enough to balance out the sweetness.

551,"2008-10-19",4.1,"My love for Belgian beers is no secret. If I can try a Belgian brew or a Belgian inspired craft American brew, I am ready and willing with glass in hand. Today I have yet another spectacular example of a traditional Belgian Abbey Ale from the brewery Ommegang. Based in Cooperstown, NY, one would imagine they had stepped into another country if they were to visit the brewery. The architecture, styling, and set-up are just as it would be if one were at a brewery in Belgium.

My Abbey Ale poured a deep burnt amber with some light brown hues. A thick fluffy head tops her off, then fades into a soft layer on top while brussels lace trails the sides. I lift my glass to my nose to partake of the amazing bouquet of flavors. Sweet, caramelized sugar. Rich dark fruits such as figs, cherries, and prunes. Tender notes of herbs and a bit of apples and spice. As I enjoy my first quaff I am struck by how full her mouthfeel is. While still pleasantly effervescent, overall a heavier body. Smooth and sweet at first, a citric bitterness of lemon and grapefruit refreshes in the finish and brings me back for more. Up front are the dark fruits I smelled in her nose with prunes, dried cherries, and raisins being the predominant flavors in my Abbey Ale’s palate. A light layer coats my mouth and lingers long after each quaff. Already well balanced, there isn’t too much change in her overall temperament as she warms. If anything, a bit more malty and rich with the citric hop twang fading a bit further into the finish.

As rich as my Ommegang Abbey Ale sounds, she is actually very well-balanced with just the prefect amount of delicate sweetness which relies on her natural fruit flavors. Not artificially cloying or overpowering. An excellent abbey ale from Ommegang and a good started Belgian ale for those who are curious, but not ready for some of the darker richer Belgians such as a dubbel or a quadrupel.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

551,"2008-10-06",4.0,"Pours a very deep maroon with voluminous head that quickly dissipates, yet never disappears entirely. Current bottle has been aged approximately 9 months since purchase, due to the over-whelming spiciness of this brew fresh. Aroma is still of heavy spice, of dark fruit, belgian funk, as well as faint cherry tartness and licorice. Taste is very deep and much more well-balanced than when fresh. The effervescent carbonation really helps to scrub the palate from the heavy dubbel taste, which makes it even more satisfying. This time around was much better than previous experiences. For people who are not fond of heavy spicing, I would definitely recommend aging it awhile to let some of that drop out.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Avengedpoet"

There are just enough notes of various fruits to make this a rather complex brew; you get a different flavor on each swig.

Yeasty dough and fruity notes to the nose.  Nice start of sweet fruits and Candi Sugar, an ""ester-take"" on heavy malts.  This leads to a yeasty bread mid-palate, with a touch of alcohol following a lightly bitter finish.  Mingling around are more notes of complexity... some wooden earth, unripened bananas (from many different layers of yeast).  Soft carbonation levels and a medium (to medium-light) embodiment tend toward an oily mouthfeel.  Nice abby dubbel, and a classic example of the style.  Would be nice paired with food.  This only gets better as it warms... nice and rounder, with lots going on; livelier carbonation levels provide more character at slightly warmer temperatures.  (Honestly, this isnt my first ""style"" of choice, but its an appreciated offering; a very good brew, staying true to the Trappist style.)  Good stuff.

Flavor is a robust combination of coriander, clove, some orange peel and a smooth blend of hops and malts.  What really impresses me about this beer is its combination of well-blended spices and a very tasty mildly sweet hoppy finish.

(Bottle) Pours a light hazy dark reddish brown colour with and off white to light brown head. The aroma is fantastic and fat with clear tones of, malt, caramel, toffee, sugar, honey, doughy yeast, dark fruits like resins, figs and plums, lighter fruits like apples, sweet oranges and pineapples. Sweet but also a bit sourish. In addition, some berry notes of grapes and cherries. Undertones of tobacco and liquorice. The nose is more like an English BW than a Belgian strong. The flavour is sweet malty, sugary and dark fruity but also a bit tart and sourish. Vinous tart with grape sand cherries. The caramel and toffee tones are more laidback in the flavour.  Finish is dry and spicy with a touch of chocolate/cocoa and anise. The mouthfeel is quite rich, warming, round and creamy with a champagne carbonation that dies out pretty fast. Light bitter. The sourish orange notes plays well with the sweetness and make the beer less cloying. Medium to full bodied.

551,"2007-12-28",3.6,"I cant believe I have not rated this.
Had a side by side of 2 year old versions of the NY and Belgian.  
The NY won by a wide margin.
Whereas the fresh version is sweet caramel and finishes dry, the NY version after two years drops a lot of the sweetness and gains a slight soda-like characteristic, but still carries most of the flavors that are present in the fresh version.
I still think the optimal aging for this beer would be around a year to 18 months, but at the same time, I think its still pretty solid.
Lots of caramel,  red apple, and fruitiness, but also the soda water taste and over-carbonation that is generally present in Ommegang beers- and a lot of belgians.","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"

Taste is light and sweet.  Starting with a full/medium body it goes down with a crisp bubbly feel and a roasted sweetness coming on.  Finish pulls from the sweet malt flavor with a nice fruity and yet spicy flavor that must come from the yeast and ends with a mellow bitterness.

Its really turbulent and cloudy.  Its a candidate for best head ever along with Hennepin.  Head and lacing are so tenacious.  The aroma is of deep grain, alcohol, grass, hay, plum, black cough drops-- all soft.  Its dank, like a basement.  It has a medium to heavy body.  Its soft and syrupy with an acidic flick at the end.  It lingers.  The flavor is like wood with tarragon, fig, plum, fennel, tamarind and brazil nuts.  Its very complex and very boozy with an aftertaste like scotch.  It actually tastes stronger than 8.5% ABV.  Great beer.","Fairport, New York, USA","yesyouam"
551,"2007-08-21",4.0,"12 oz bottle purchased at the brewery. Poured a murky brown with a large off white frothy head. Aroma was complex with the standard yeastiness of a Belgian style but also had a ton of fruit including raisins, plums, prunes, banana tied in with a light maltiness. For some reason on my initial sip I got a mouthful of a metalic flavor but after that first sip it disappeared. Flavor was dark fruit, yeast and candy sugar. This beer was far better then I remembered it and was a nice suprise on a rainy day off from work.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
551,"2007-08-20",4.4,"First of all, any beer with a cork already gets cool points. Ommegangs (1 pt. 9.4 oz. bottle) pour is beautiful, a deep, dark, ruby-tinted brown with a lasting cream-colored head. And, the taste aint no slouch either. Immediately after the pour, I smelled some dark fruits, or raisin, which later developed into a fuller sensation with strawberry or raspberry. The taste which followed the sniff was obviously fruity, with some sweets and some sours, and underscored by a decent balance of roast and bitter. The finish is a little bitter (and you definitely know youre getting the 8.5% alcohol), and it really seems somewhere between grape juice and wine. Ommegang is definitely one of my faves.","Missouri, USA","GlenVargas"

There is arguably some bitter, and likely some anise. Complex ale.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

There is an appealing aroma of caramel, candy sugar, dark fruits, apples, root beer, and a faint bit of alcohol.  The flavor blends all of these aromatic elements together into a sweet, creamy, fruity caramel concoction.  The taste is really, really good.  I would classify the body as medium and very smooth.

551,"2007-07-29",3.9,"Pours a dark brown with shades of red and a tan head. Leaves some lace. Nose is yeasty with the same sort of dark fruit aromas Id expect from ales like this. The first to come to mind is raisin, but one could find others in there, too. There is also a bit of caramel and the slightest hint of alcohol, but it is mostly fruity. The taste has the same sort of fruitiness as the nose. Again, I found raisins most prominently, but I also thought there was a bit of ripe plum in there, too. Under this is a mild, but noticeable backdrop of caramel and toffee. The finish is dark and dry. The caramel (somewhat toasty/roasty, I think) malts mostly come through here, as the prominent fruitiness fades, and there is a slight alcohol warmth as the beer goes down. The mouth feel is medium and a little creamy. I think Ive experienced this same set of flavors in a certain quad. That one punched me in the mouth with Trappist goodness, but this one is more forgiving. I like the other more, but this one is still very good.","High Point, North Carolina, USA","NCsparkster"

Lots of fruit again, with the same character as in the aroma, especially apple. Medium mouthfeel, good finish length.

551,"2007-06-20",3.6,"Pours a deep wine-red with some brownish hues and a medium foaming beige head. Aromas flit between dark and chocolatey to must to figs, dates, and caramel.

The beer has lively carbonation, which made me burp more than any abbey ale Ive ever tried and is not as full bodied as I expected. Its definitely malty but not overly sweet, and its got a smattering of acidity and bitterness. But the thing you definitely wont mistake is the alcohol, which is very forward, perhaps overly so. 

This was not the first time I had this one and Im wondering if this bottle had suffered from improper care.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","blueduk"

It is bottle conditioned with medium size particles floating around.  The aroma is very complex and very good.  It is fruity with caramel, molasses and a hint of alcohol.  The taste, this is very complex also.  As the discription says, you start out with a sweetness that reminds you of honey followed by caramel and then after that is some toffee.  There is a very slight hint of licorice, along with a slight sourness, and as the beer warms up the sourness stands out a little more.  The body is medium with a dry and creamy texture and soft carbonation.  Over all this is a very good and very complex beer.

Over carbonated on the tongue but the flavors come out similar to the nose red fruit, dried fruit, yeast, toasted, hints of toffee and chocolate with a carmel backbone.

Flavor is nice but nothing compared to the nose; not as fruity as I would have thought.  Honey and chocolate are dominant with lighter notes of yeast, toffee, anise, and faint toast note; decent bitterness and dryness  to go along with a minimal fruit note, apricot maybe.

Serving: 750 mL bottle (8.5% ABV).  Thanks Matt!
Event: Weekly Friday night tasting.
Location: Rivers Bend Wine & Spirits.
Tasting Notes
Aroma: Sweet berries, caramelized fruit, and brown sugar.
Appearance: Dark ruby copper with a dense, rocky, dark beige/light tan colored head.
Flavor: Mellow British maltiness (caramel, toffee, light butterscoth flavors), figs, and some sort of red wine depth.  The alcohol strength is controlled and is quite mellow as compared to the Ommegang Hennepin (even though the alchohol content is higher in this beer).  The flavor seems to flatten out some as the beer warms.
Palate: Medium to medium-full body.  Smooth on the palate with a bit of creamy feeling as well.
Overall: This beer is complex, interesting, and very easy and enjoyable to drink.  Ommegang makes some really good beers at a great price (750 mL bottle for only $4.99+tax!).  .","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

Big, fruity aroma with some notes of raspberry licorice, toffee, and sherried green raisins.  Marachino cherry, caramel, and a subtle touch of clove spice.  Not too much phenolic spice in the nose; the fruity dimensions are the clear focal point.  Medium bodied, heavily carbonated texture that lightens up the palate weight enough to make it remarkably easy to drink.  Huge flavors, however.  Rustic, well toasted pumpernickel bread crust, mild chocolate licorice, and prune flesh create an intense flavor layer.  Behind the dark malts, some spicy yeast chracters follow closely.

551,"2007-03-01",3.9,"The aroma was malty with dark caramel and some dark fruit presence. A candy aroma was prevalent with a nice peppery spice. The fruity presence had cherries, raisins and some slight prune. The beer was crystal clear amber brown into the chalice and had a fleeting yellowish head which lasted just enough to lace. The flavor was malty with dark caramel, chocolate and more of the dark fruit presence than was promised by the aroma. The dark fruits were prunes, raisins and this time black cherries in the background. The caramel presence was strong but the beer quickly dried on the palate with a peppery spice and decent level of earthy bittering. The body was medium and the beer had a fairly high level of carbonation despite the fleeting head. This one has aged very well.

Flavor is slightly vinous with more concentrated components eluded to by the aroma. Big raspberries, dusty cocoa, prunes galore. Additions include raisin bread and distinct Belgian yeast. Palate is warm and somewhat syrupy. Finish is somewhat dry with some good bitterness forcing its way through. This is a very good strong ale, this breweries best offering, to me.

The smell instantly gave me raw sugar. It has (again Ill say) very Belgian strong, dark characteristics in the smell. It is that, somewhat sweet, sparkly light (champagne of beers) attribute. Second I got the smell of toffee and subtle fruit undertones.

The taste is malty fruity and light. This is a unique and confusing taste. I LIKE THAT! It tastes like sugar but it is not sweet. I concurred with another BA friend that it is the dryness of this beer that troughs you off. Similar to champagne (which may be sweet) the sweet taste is only right up front, and then its the dryness that you notice. So it does not drink like a very sweet beer. The mouthfeel is very light, and crispy with an intriguing fruity after taste. It is very carbonated so you feel the tiny bubbles on your tongue. It is a quite refreshing beer.

It is very guzzleable. Its remarkably easy to put down, maybe because of the light refreshing mouth feel or maybe because of how light the beer sits in your stomach. Regardless, if you are looking for a beer that youll hardly notice, that wont get you full or sit in your stomach this maybe the one you looking for. I would definitely consider this beer to be Recommended. 

Hope this is helpful.

It is murky brown with a fizzy, creamy, stiff head which is maintained throughout the time of consumption.  The head is off-white to tan and clings to the glass in big chunks like a fly to fly paper.  It boasts a strong spicy aroma along with ripe bananas and vanilla.  The taste was more delightfully interesting than the aroma.  I noticed a strong cherry flavor along with alcohol, yeast, prunes and bicycle tire (similar to a fat tire, but skinnier!).  The medium body is not too thick or too thin, just right.  And it leaves a great taste lingering in your mouth beckoning you to try another.

Dark brown almost completel opaque body with three fingers of head that slowly dissipates.  Smells chocolatey with some fruit and alcohol notes.  Tastes fruity, maybe of grape with a little citrus with more chocolate at the finish.  Rather well-ballanced between the two.  Alcohol, while present, is not very noticeable.  On the higher end of medium-bodied, with a pleasant silky smooth texture.  Definitely a sipper, but very enjoyable, especially for cold late fall and winter nights like tonight. The alcohol is so well-hidden, it creeps up on you.  An excellent beer, and a steal at 5$ per 750ml bottle.  Fantastic, worthwhile ale.","Derry, New Hampshire, USA","BigBen2120"

551,"2006-01-28",4.8,"Ommegang is an Abbey Dubble by style, and it is very interesting and delicious one. All of Brewery Ommegangs beers are brewed with spices, and Ommegang contains spices including coriander, star anise, and even the rare African spice grains of paradise. The brewery likes to call this a burgundian beer, as it shares many traits of burgundy wine, and works exceptionally well with red meats, game, cheeses, and a number of dishes you would match a good burgundy wine with. 
Ommegang pours to a beautiful, bright, burgundy red color with a thick and creamy white head, and a good bit of carbonation. The nose on this beer is very impressive with lots of aromas of chocolate, malt, estery aromas of fruit, yeast, and peppery alcohol. The palate on this beer is complex and layered with lots of good sweet malt and chocolate flavors, plummy fruit, and hints of toffee and raisin. Ommegang finishes with more of those complex and delicious malt and fruit flavors up front, then ends with some good yeasty and peppery alcohol flavors that linger. 

This is a complex, delicious, very well done example of an Abbey Dubble, from an outstanding NY brewery. At 8.5% abv, Ommegang is the type of beer to share and relax with. As stated, it is an excellent beer to pair with a number of dishes, ranging from a cheese course, to meats, to a rich desert. Marketed in 750ml caged and corked bottles and 12 oz 4 pack bottles, Ommegang is well worth seeking out in markets where it is sold.

551,"2005-11-09",3.4,"As we walk back from the liquor store, my friend and I often like to read off the label of our latest acquisition as we prepare for a rating session. This time it was long after we had gotten back and established ourselves at the bar of his kitchen, that we were finally ready to actually drink Ommegang. Indeed, the six pack and bottles feature more quotes, facts and stories than the Guinness book itself. I dont know how they managed to fit it all there, its really quite a feat. The pour was nice but nothing terribly exciting: a thick yellowish head towering over the reddish brown liquid. The aroma however was quite pleasant, blending dark fruits and malts. Port wine, plums, figs and licorice held a fine balance with the brown sugar and chocolate base. Some alcohol was noticeable but not overwhelmingly so. As I took my time to analyze the nose, my friend and I would take turns discovering new facts on every part of the packaging. As I finally took a sip, I was greeted with a metallic, salty, bitter flavor that I really was not expecting. I noticed a familiar flavor, reminding of a really bad Rochefort 8 - as if someone took a leak in my beer. I mean Rochefort is pretty amazing to begin with, so that was still quite good. However I resorted to take long sniffs before each tip of the glass as the aroma seems far more pleasurable than the taste. When I finally finished the six-pack I noticed a whole new chapter of text on the underside of the box... Its just too much.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

551,"2005-11-01",3.4,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2007 A warning before you pick up a bottle of Ommegang.  Get something to eat.  Anything, really, so long as you can chew it.  I dont think the Ommegang was made to be drunk by itself.  Having it without food just felt awkward, like the beer was embarrassed of me for having hands bereft of chips or nuts.  Also, you might want to get rid of all your reading material.  Books, magazines, journals, put them all away.  The Ommegang has enough writing on it to entertain you for weeks.  My personal goal, inspired by the loquacious label, is to write my college thesis on a six pack of beer bottles.  Chapter 1 through Chapter 6, legible, intelligent opinions filled with beer!  What professor would give me a bad grade?  We move on.
What is Ommegang like?  Im still asking myself, and havent come up with a good answer.  The beer is dark with a crimson glow, and the aroma has a lot of dark fruits inside, including grapes, plums and figs.  It also has a lot of alcohol in the smell.  Thats a trait off putting to me, but I know others like it.  The beer is probably the most similar flavor to a dry wine Ive yet had; its a strong dry alcohol taste with a beer feel.  Again, it felt uncomfortable, but I think some supplementary food would do the trick.  One of the numerous and elaborate volumes written on the label explains what comestibles go best with the Ommegang.  Id recommend following the instructions, partly because a brewer knows his beer the best of anyone, and also because something needs to tame that pungent wine flavor.

551,"2005-10-31",3.2,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2006 How funny!  This bottle is cave aged in Howe Cavern ... like the beer cares how the temperature is maintained?  Like it knows if the air is artificially or naturally maintained at a constant temperature?  Surprisingly, I did not enjoy the cave aged bottle as much as my earlier bottles, which seemed much more like a Chimay Blue; this is basically midway between the Chimay and a Belgian Brown.  Color is a dark reddish brown, not as opaque as I remember, with a huge tan head that vanishes without a trace.  Sweet malt, a little dark roast, a little toffee, a little coffee, a little dried fruit ... but somehow all of that is dominated by alcohol and bubblegum; less Bourbon and more barleywine.  This was not nearly as good as I remembered it from several happy previous occasions.  // Rerated, this time with the regular (not Howe Cavern aged) Ommegang.  No change in the review.  Yeah, this is a well made beer.  And yeah, it looks good, but would look better with a little less head.

Now, why I give it such a high score: The finish is pure butter toffee! Ive never tasted anything like it. A hint of dark chocoloate, too, but the toffee flavor fills my mouth.

Aroma was intruguing - strong wine (sour), ferment raisins an other fruits dominated on first sniff, then fairly heavy malts, not much hop, heavy yeast - cheese? - and a tang of lime.

Very complex mouthfeel, hard to describe - slightly lively, oily and alcoholic, but not really.

551,"2005-07-08",3.7,"Bottle. Dark ruby color, pillowy tan head left great lacing on my glass. One sniff and I get a lot of different aromas, dark fruits (plums and raisins mostly), then a bit of a toasty hint after that. Also a bit of cocoa or coffee, though very faint, hiding in there. Flavor starts out rather sweet, a lot of persistent action on the front of my tongue, kind of a honey sweetness to it. After that the fruitiness takes control, a bit of viniousness towards the middle. Mouthfeel is rich at first, then becomes very dry in the end, though overall the body seemed to be a bit lacking towards the end, the flavors hung around but they seemed a little faint for an ale of this strength. Fairly well rounded flavor makes this a good belgian style, its certainly a contrast in that respect to the Stone VE series (to compare it to a different American interpretation of the style) which are a lot bolder but rough around the edges.

551,"2005-07-07",3.1,"The cork finished bottle is a nice presentation for this belgian-esque beer, Someone must have been kind of rough with my bottle though. Cork shot out with a huge ""pop!"" and then foamed all over me, the carpet, et cetera. Once that excitement was over and I got some into the glass, it was a deep ruby/brown, with lots of tan head that seems to start out fairly course and settle into a nice fine skim. Aromas of brown sugar, molasses, figs, banana. Tawny port-like palate, and much chewier than I expect for a belgian-style ale. The sugar additions are  rather evident. Quite sweet toffee flavors. Is that diacetyl? Something there reminds me a bit of Samuel Smiths buttery taste.

This is quite an interesting and distinctive beer for the money, and I admire the enthusiasm of the Ommegang folks for making traditional Belgian styles in the US. To my tastes however, this particular beer was kind of rough. Much more residual sweetness than I like, becoming cloying after just half a glass and covering up any flavor subtleties. A year or two of aging might fix that, and I plan give that a try.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"

From an two year old + bottle: Pours a deep rich multihued brown and copper with a small fading frothy head but good lace was noted. The aroma has notes licorice, currant, prune, hints of caramel and mocha, earthy yeast esters, and a light oxidition notes that works well.

It is a characteristics that has not changed since the first time I ever had it. The finish has that licorice twang and a bit of honey too.

551,"2005-06-06",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2006 6/9/06: Brown sugar and bready aroma, caramelly, and with a sweetness I asscociate with De Dolle. Kind of beety but sharp, alcoholic and slightly fruity but a very unique smell. The pour is a thick, dark brown with a nice head that fades into a wet foam cap. The taste is bitterly pungent, alcoholic up front, with that same yeasty sweetness mentioned before. It is vegetably and smooth, with a gushy, green, obtuse zucchini finish (I dont know how else to describe it!). Really, the taste is kind of bland and one-dimensional, which is funny as when I first rated this as only my 15th or so ratings I thought the flavor was great. Its interesting how things change and how much ones palate grows. 

6/6/05: Malt, maybe a little caramel in the aroma. Pours a nice full head that quickly deteriorates, but is wonderful and creamy in the mouth. The beer itself is full and enveloping. Chocolaty, dark malt, a bit of citrusy bitterness at the finish, maybe a touch of cherry, with a subtle but lingering warm, malty aftertaste. 5/3/9/5/17","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

The caramel really came through in the aroma on this one.  My brother in law had a Chimay Grand Reserve when I had this one and they were very similar in appearance. The Chimay was a little smoother. The Ommegang had a bit more fizz to it yet overall you could tell they were going for a similar thing. 7-4-7-4-17

Spicy, earthy aromas: lemon pepper, honey, clay dust, bubblegum, pipe tobacco, green bananas, and ...pomegranate maybe? Soft, spicy flavor starts with medicinal/smoky phenols and becomes ann odd cacophany of dried mint leaves, hay, freshly-dug earth, wood, apple seeds, and hot vinyl. Fluffy, cottony, and tingly in the mouth. Dry finish with aftertastes of anise and cantaloupe, and eventually low-fat milk. Far from ""rich, fruity"" as the label claims. Complex and strange.

The mouthfeel is nice, but not great. I would have liked to see some more sediment and a little more complexity. I might have to cellar one for a while, and see how that changes it.

Medium bubble lacing is not too sticky.  Prickly hops add nice counterpoint to the cookie malt flavors with notes of golden raisin, spiced apple, and dark cherry.  Finish is kind of lackluster, the flavors just trail off; its almost dry, with a distinctly spicy character (oregano, basil, black pepper).  Somewhat salty.

I wished more beer looked like this.  The aroma is a bit light.  Hints of light toasted malts and lightly acedic (perhaps this is licorice).  Dates are hiding under there.  The flavor is of toasted malts, a little caskiness, some really ripe bananas.  The flavor lingers.  Medium bodied beer with a huge carbonation.  This carbonation kinda kills the flavor.

551,"2005-03-19",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2008 I went on a tour of the Ommegang brewery a few years back and was pleasantly surprised to see a Belgian strong ale made in Upstate NY of all places. I dig the corks. Down the road, they had it on tap. It has a nice fruity taste which blends well with its alcohol percentage but its not necesarily memorable given its competitors. It does what it wants to do and does not strive higher. Personally, I enjoy their Three Philosophers beer better because they mix this with Kriek.
Rerate: Ill stick with the previous score: there is a bit of a clovey coriander flavor standing out which diminishes the sweet fruit tones despite a nice malty backbone. I say lessen the spices and this would be top dog. Has this occurred since Duvel took over?","East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","JFURYCAT"

Shes full bodied, sweet and rich. Just the way I like em.  She has prunes and brandy on her breath and though shes chewing some sort of spicy herbal gum, I can tell shes been drinking a bit, I do catch a whiff of alcohol.

551,"2004-12-21",4.4,"Opaque deep brown beer with a huge, foamy tan head that hangs out for a while and leaves nice lacing as it slowly departs. Hold it up to the light and youll see that the color is actually burgundy as the description states. Aroma is big, malty and full of yeast, spice, and alcohol. Flavor is tangy, peppery, and alkaline. Notes of nut, malt, hops, yeast, alcohol, fruit, molasses, pine, and oak swirl in the palate. Finishes dry and very wine-like. Overall, a vinous beer with deep color and character. A fine Belgian style strong ale. Would go well with red meat or a good cigar.","Sarasota, Florida, USA","DKlovesbeer"

After a while it seems to develop a slight sour taste to it.  This beer is good, but I dont like the strong alcohol taste in my beers, so I cant rate it as high as most. I dont mind an alcohol presence but it has to be a background flavor not a dominant one.

Re-rate of the cave-aged version

Nice aroma of honey, cherry, light caramel, light apple, and yeast.  Pours a nice transparent red with an off-white head with very nice retention.  Very fruity up front with cherry, grape, and raisin.  Finishes with a huge caramel and toffee presence with light yeastiness.  Creamy mouthfeel with a little burn from acidity.  Only the slightest hint of alcohol in the finish.  Granted this the ""cave-aged"" version, but Ill chalk up the previous rating to beer rating inexperience (original was somewhere around my 50th rating)moreso than the cave-aging.

Nice head that dissipated into a small treacle on the glass. The taste was at first satisfying. Nice and round, dark and malty. However immediately afterwards the palate sucks up into a something very sharp in your mouth. finishes off with a flat bitterness that is marked by an overalcoholization and a bitter dryness on the back of yuor tongue. AWFUL!!! Tasted like I was drinking malt liquor. Terrible. Ive had better belgian strongs. This one was awful. Maybe a skunky bottle. Pretty much terrible though. Should try it again.

Why? 1. It demonstates best my personal belief that the best beer in the world is coming out of American craftbrewers, and the greatest brewing nation, for that reason, is the good ol' U.S.A. If you have a friend who is an import beer snob, loves Belgians, but gives micros the air, let them try this blindfolded and watch 'em eat crow! 2. It tastes so good!
Color is dark amber to a rich, rustic brown. Hue of the head leans toward a dark orange, and is mighty and boisterous--I can hear it across the room! Aroma makes itself known from far off, too. It's utterly luxurious: toffee, chocolate, plums, grapes, dark fruit, leather, tobacco, flowers, sugar and spice and everything nice! A thick, musky, full aroma. On the lips and over the tongue, it's smooth, mellow, and extremely flavorful. Warming, deliciously hopped, tingly and enticing. Goes down so nice, and makes you feel good all the way.

Has a deep, rich taste of molasses or brown sugar, with subtle spiciness and tart highlights. Carbonation gives it kind of a champagne-like texture. It's winey-sweet without being cloying, and I also get notes of slow charries and raisins. Pouring in the sediment from the bottom adds an impression of grape tannins.

551,"2004-03-29",4.5,"750 mL Bottle, 3/29/04.  Glorious rich ruby-brown, cloudy, syrupy pour.  Massive brown head that fades, but a fine coating head lingers.  Aromas burst of rich, ripe fruits - cherries, blueberry, apple.  Nutmeg and sherry.  Smells a tad barley-wine-ish.  Flavor has initial metallic tang, but that leaves with the head and chil and is never noticable on the nose.  Simple malts are the name of this beers game, but full and delicious.  Fruits are lost in the flavor but for some raisin, plum that emerge with temperature.  This beer really mellows and improves as it warms.  Fantastic!  Around 60F+ it is all Toffee, chocolate, and port...yumm!!

The palate is smooth, thinner than expected.  Not sweet of cloying as I feared, but a balancing tingly carbonation that excites the mouth.  The finish is rather abrupt and dry.  Some hops bite closes the deal nicely.  Another great experience form Ommegang.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

I'm getting the distinct sensation of a Granny Smith apple: sweet yet tart. The alcohol is quite noticable leaving behind an almost gin-like taste.

Mouthfeel is quite good: smooth and creamy. It doesn't seem that carbonated, but if you hold it in your mouth for longer than a few short seconds, you're gonna have some suds flowing somewhere.

Drinkability is good for a Belgian style; I find most to be too sweet. This one could go a few rounds.","Port Orchard, Washington, USA","Gromit"

The aroma; at first I detect raisin and a bit of rum, then I get some subdued notes of sherry.  The taste is a bit spicy with some light sherry notes to it.  This beer has a fairly good amount of body to it as well.  The finish is slightly on the hot side, spicy.

Pours a dark cloudy walnut with maple highlights.  The average fizzy rose/tan head is fully diminishing with no lacing.  The awesome nose is as close to perfect as I have yet to sample.  The cornucopia of aromas includes (but is not limited to) caramel, brown sugar, fruit, anise, pepper, chianti, cola nuts, and vanilla.  I regret that I only had one bottle, and didn't have about 8 hours or so to just whif on this bad boy, because I'm sure that I could come up with an infinite number of subtleties in the nose.  The balanced flavor is according to my notes ""as deep as a pacific chasm - there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited"".  The full body is velvety and dry.  The only flaw in the palate is a slight amount of cloying quality at the finish.  This brew is not a pretender.  I would put this on par with Westy 12 and Rochefort 10.

Striking aroma, suggesting buckets of candy sugar, bits of alcohol, but more than anything else a strongly fruity note.  I can't quite place it but neither does it seem complex: is it banana-plum?  Caramel-cranberry-muffin?  The flavor repeats this strong fruity vein, with fluffy palate (lively carbonated but subdued by a rich maltiness).  The alcohol can be found, but it isn't particularly pressing on my tongue.  I'd like to have this in a blind side-by-side, because while there is a lot to like here, at the same time I couldn't quite find myself satisfied by its depth of flavor, as it seemingly came up short both in the finish.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

Ommegang poured a very dark red, which was nice, but it was the head that caught my eye. The tan head rose and rose and rose from my Chimay goblet until the frothy tower rose a full half inch above my glass without falling. I fought through the foamy jungle to get at the nectar below.
The aroma was of malt, a sweetness I didn't expect in such a great magnitude. At first taste my eyes widened, literally. This little bottle packed a huge flavor. The malt sweetness was there, along with a smoothness of dry alcohol, which imparted a warmness. There was definately a taste of fruit there, cherries perhaps?

Aftertaste very bittered from the malt and from the chocolate flavours and the alcohol is still noticeable very late on.

551,"2003-08-22",3.3,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2005 Rerate: 5-11-2005.  750 mL bottle, snifter.  Massive creamy and frothy light tan head with some larger bubbles.  Seriously deep burgundy hue is slightly hazy.  Cookie, caramel and light nut malt aroma.  Perfume hops.  Leathery, leafy yeast profile.  The main story is the esters though.  Grape, plum, pineapple, black cherry, anise, nutmeg.  Verysharp aromas.  Not nearly as smooth or enticing as I originally had thought.  Quite sweet and acidic (tart) up front.  Finishes with less sweetness and a light bitterness, but mostly a tart and sour acidityquite like cherries.  Medium bodied with an oily texture and fizzy carbonation.  I just dont know whats happened here.  I had it several times from the 750 and it was incredible.  I moved onto other things and picked up a four pack later on.  Those four bottles were all filled with the same cherry acidity that I mentioned above.  I figured it must be an anomaly limited to the smaller bottles.  Having finally picked up another 750 I see that its not.  Sad.12 oz bottle, goblet, 52 degrees.  Well lasting, frothy, tan head sits on a murky brown-red body that has particles of all sizes.  Molasses, caramel, nutty malts; flowery, herby hops; doughy, earth, cobweb yeast; cinnamon, brown sugar, toffee and maple scents round out the nose.  The overall aroma is of a deep, rich, sweet, and complex brew.  Heavily sweet flavor becomes a moderately sweet, lightly bitter finish.  A nice tingleling acidity is left on the tip of my tongue.  The finishing flavors linger forever.  Medium-full body is creamy with tight, fizzy carbonation.  Touch of alcohol is present.  Flavor delivers everything that the aroma promised.  The bottom line is: looks, smells, tastes, feels excellent, but alcohol just shouldnt be able to cut through all of those deep and rich flavors.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

551,"2003-07-10",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2007 Deep black cherry/brown color.  Smells of strong fruits. Initial taste is heavily fruity and clears a bit, narrowing off into a bit more astringent palate.  It had plenty of body and was overflowing with ripe fruit flavors, cherry being the most prominent, while plum and almost a blueberryish flavor contributed as well.  Finishes with some yeast and sweetness and a little exra malt that is almost slightly bitter.  This, like Trois Pistoles, is a beer I keep coming back to, I dont know what exactly it is, maybe my inexperienced Belgian palate, but I have found that these  rounder, less astringent belgians are more in line with the typical anglo-american beer palate.  Anyways this is good stuff. Rerate.  Been a while since I had it, so I tried it again.  Great pour, opaque, lots of beige head, lacing.  Aroma is pretty decent, plums, alcohol, raisins, slight tart cherry.  Flavor begins with brown sugar and dry plums, good amount of malt.  Dries out towards the finish, which is a bit too astringent, while the alcohol is quite apparent.  Still, a high quality brew.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

551,"2003-06-25",3.2,"I sampled the corked, 25.4 oz bottle conditioned variety.  This is a deep brown-red ale with a vast, mostly dissipating but nicely laced, tan colored head.  There is a strong aroma of dark-roasted malt, overripe cherry or raisin and raw alcohol.  The initial flavor is quite sweet, almost like a port wine.  Cherry, raisin and other fruit flavors dominate the short, somewhat coarse palate; nice carbonation.  There is little noticeable hop flavor, but the finish is quite dry due to the strong presence of alcohol at the back end.  Overall, a very agreeable interpretation of a Belgian strong ale somewhat compromised by the short palate.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ivan9856"

Outstanding for an American-Belgian beer, the best Ive had from this country...why dont some of the hard-hitting micros (Stone, Rogue, etc.) do Belgians?  HTOD Rose is nice but not as good as Ommegang.

ORIGINAL RATING: Very nice looking in my Chimay glass, and I liked the bottle - the label on the back was laid out like a sports page stat table in USA Today.  Deep amber color, nice looking head.  Very floral bouquet with some citrus, and the I thought that the flavor was right up there with the worlds finest in terms of complexity - I could just about feel it shifting flavors from instant to instant.  I got honey, bananas, oranges, caramel, chocolate, perhaps even a bit of pineapple.  A classic!","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"

Pungeant as heck as it arrives at room temp.  Soft feel is like liquid silk.  Brisk carbonation, somewhat velvety.  Licorice notes, very sweet raisiny malt, honey, fig, and plum.  Adequately spicy hop finish with  nice touch of dryness. Absolutely balanced to perfection.

Smooth yet assertive mouthfeel.  I thought this was a wonderful American interpritation of a belgian strong ale, yet at the same time I think this is its flaw.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"
551,"2002-01-02",4.5,"Worthy of the Belgian style presentation.  Certainly more than 1/2 the Belgian beer for 1/2 the Belgian price.","dalton, Massachusetts, USA","garv"
551,"2001-12-29",4.4,"Enjoyed the liquorice taste. The Belgian candy sugar taste adds to the flavor. I have since copied a receipe like this and made one that tastes similar. Hard to find this beer.","Port Jefferson Station, New York, USA","NYDennis"
551,"2001-12-14",3.8,"A worthy effort at trying to duplicate Belgium excellence.   The aroma was decidedly fruity with large hints of grapes and apples.   Ommegang was a ruddy unfiltered brown orange with a small pillowy head.   The taste was slightly complex but it lacked the deapth and breadth of a true Belgium ale.   The 8.5% abv really showed in the taste giving it whiskey hints.    The flavor profile was dominated by strong fruit, especially apple.   I know this can sometimes be an off-taste, but it seemed to be intentional in this case.   It was so pervasive that it almost seemed like a fruit-beer or a lambic failure.   This strong ale finished with a puckering tartness.   I found Ommegang to be like a decent cover-band that plays your home town--readily available and pretty good. but makes you wish you had the real thing.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","lizziesage"
551,"2001-12-14",4.3,"A most satisfying brew for my 100th. Why do I like the raisiny flavor here when I hate raisins?","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","baseballguy"
551,"2001-12-13",3.7,"Definitely quite a bit of liquorice and candi sugar in both aroma and taste.  Faint sourness is present.  Quite pleasant, but not terribly complex.  That said both a value in terms of price and as a document to the American take on a belgian style.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"

551,"2001-11-28",4.0,"Im updating this due to the fact that I tried this again and I think my palate has developed a bit more since the original rating.  Fruity aroma (banana, pear) with banana dominating.  Sweet, malty, slightly sour with a complex flavor character.  Ruby red with a large, rich head that didnt have as much staying power as I might have liked.  Very tasty.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

551,"2001-07-23",3.3,"Dark, cherry red with a thick, creamy head. Prune, raisin aroma almost ruined by alcohol presence. The taste, on the other hand, WAS ruined by the alcohol presence.  Although it didnt subdue the many flavors of this beer, it was the most dominant. Other flavors include raisin, prune, and hints of red grape.  Smooth, but could be smoother.  A nice brew from my home state (NY), but I prefer their Hennepin.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
551,"2001-07-14",4.0,"Overwhelming banana aroma and flavor. I cant say Iwas disappointed but my expectations were rather low. Beautiful to look at in the glass with its rich ruby colour. Dry wood ester finish.","Mt.Prospect, Illinois, USA","Drew Blood"
551,"2001-07-11",4.0,"Quite a strong brew. Heavy hints of red wine in the flavor. An initial bitterness gave way to a pleasant spicy flavor. Not as full-bodied as Id hoped, and somewhat too carbonated, but overall a pleasant beer.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
551,"2001-07-10",4.0,"A suprisingly good strong ale...Dark amber color, strong fruity notes and fairly smooth. I finished off a 750 ml tonight and it developed a little bit of a winey aftertaste, but overall much better than I expected based on the price.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"

551,"2001-06-24",2.2,"A beginners abbey-style ale.  Unfortunately those attracted by the price will be thwarted away by a rather thin, bland, one-dimensional beer.  Sad when their Hennepin is a great rendition of its kind.
There are so many beers in this dubbel range that are so good, including those from North American competitors Unibrou and Allagash, this cheaper version unfortunately betrays the Belgian Beer Expert claims of its owners.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","MonkeyProver99"

551,"2001-06-08",4.6,"A perfect example of a beer that is extremely flavorful without being extremely heavy.  Strong spice flavors.  Flavor really lasts on the back of the tongue.  Unlike some of this style, it doesnt seem to be overly filling (or maybe I was just anxious to try my next selection).  Lighter bodied but with a stronger flavor than New Belgium Brewing Companys offerings.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","Rambis"

It has a very nice nose.  Dark fruits and caramel/toffee are up front.  Some yeastiness and breadiness in there too.  The taste is quite good.  There is almost no sweetness, in fact it finishes a bit dry.  Toffee notes, some of the dark fruits and some chocolate.   A nice beverage!","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
