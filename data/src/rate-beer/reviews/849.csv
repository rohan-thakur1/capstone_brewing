849,"2017-05-19",3.3,"Bottle from Beers of Europe. Dark gold, a bit hazy. No head but theres some visible carbonation. Light aroma of papaya, apricot, some doughy yeast. It smell so like its going to be quite sweet, and it is. Sweet with alcohol not hidden at all. Some tropical fruit hop bitterness gives some balance but it remains big, boozy and brash. The unwieldy booze burns a bit on the way down. Strong lagers are a hard style to carry off for me, and this is far better than most, but its a trifle messy.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"

849,"2016-04-25",3.7,"350ml bottle from Beers of Europe. Hazy golden orange colour with a thick two-finger white head which was long-lasting. Aroma is hoppy with some sweet malt and fruit, pine, alcohol. Taste is mostly the same with a strong hop presence, sweet malt, pine, bitter finish with alcohol and some strange floral flavours. Nice beer though.","Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","LazyPyro"
849,"2016-04-24",2.9,"18th April 2016Hazy gold beer, tidy white head. Palate is light, semi dry and has decent fine carbonation. Smooth malt base, but there is a grainy alcohol here to, almost vodka like. Mild floral spice. Whisper of citrus peel. Smooth semi dry finish. A little odd but not unpleasant.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"

849,"2013-04-13",4.0,"Great beer. Poured a golden amber. Hopppy spruce, slightly bitter aroma. A very complex flavor with strong hop influence. If you dont like hops you wont like this beer. The flavor really stays in the mouth long after a taste.Smooth finish with very little alcohol flavor, at 9 degrees very well done!","viña del mar, CHILE","gringoroll"
849,"2013-01-18",3.9,"On bottle from Bierfest Santiago.
Golden color, good foam.
Intense hoppy aromas (pine), caramel, toffee- some fruitiness.
Full body & high complexity.
Solid bitterness- ibus ( 30) making an effect.
Very enjoyable
