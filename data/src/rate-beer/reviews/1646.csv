1646,"2017-02-15",4.0,"Lo primero que llama la atención de esta cerveza es su chapa, que se abre con una anilla, como si fuera una granada. 
Color marrón profundo, pràcticamente opaco. Fantástica formación de espuma de café, muy cremosa y de burbuja pequeña (muy pequeña). Muy persistente y con muy buena adherencia, dejando un espectacular encaje de Bruselas. 
Intensa en nariz, da inmediatamente notas de chocolate y café. Entre las notas afrutadas, da algo de pasas muy suave. También algunas notas de tierra seca. No aprecio notas florales, herbales ni especiadas (aunque la verdad es que tengo la nariz un poquito taponada). 
El primer sabor que viene es el amargo, siempre de la mano de un punto de acidez. Hay también desde luego una nota de dulce, pero es francamente suave. 
Peso medio en boca y textura crujiente y algo picante, debido al amargor del torrefacto. En el retrogusto sale caramelo de café y algunas notas ligeramente acres, pero sobre todo, pan muy tostado. Persistencia en boca muy larga, liderada siempre por el amargor proveniente de la malta torrefacta. 
Una cerveza intensa de sabor y con carácter, aunque dando un resultado muy satisfactorio. De trago medio, maridará bien con chocolate y con casi cualquier cosa que vaya bien con pan tostado.","Valencia, SPAIN","JuanCC"

1646,"2016-07-21",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Roasted bitterness and acidity are balanced by chocolate cake icing in this bloated, super nitrogenated Stout.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A perfect head of creamy foam lingers all the way through the pint atop the pitch black.
-Malts are characterful enough to still convey a few coffee notes.
-This was served very cold.
-Mouthfeel is heavy, quite sweet, an impression enhanced by the intense nitrogen treatment.
-Differences between their Wrasslers Stout, Oyster Stout and Plain Porter are diminished because of the nitrogen.

The cap has a ring to it, for easy removal. Pours a completely opaque black colour under a thick, moussy, thickly lacing, medium beige head. Aroma shouts tons of cookie dough at first, accompanied by hints of cappuccino, caramel candy, gingerbread, liquorice candy, pronounced iron, mocha, candied figs, cloves, chicory. Concentrated dried fruits flavour at first, with a fatty, oily, smooth mouthfeel, faintly sweet but nothing really reminiscent of candi or other sugar, dry with a soft, sweetish nutty and chocolatey maltiness, clear but not really disturbing iron, light spiciness, finishing in a full-fledged coffeeish and chicory-like roasted bitterness lasting for a long time and aided by peppery and earthy hop bitterness. Appetizing, dry and with indeed an authentic feel to it (inasmuch as this is assessible - given the fact no one alive today was around when Michael Collins drank the original version); very good in its particular style, feeling more natural than Guinness Draught, for example.

Highly engaging aroma of caramel, brown sugar, and milk chocolate; a rounded, toasted-marshmallow / light roast and vanilla note plays out at the core; endearing, generous without being cloying, solid. Medium to medium-light body; relaxed carbonation. Lots of robust milk chocolate, caramel, and gentle levels of roast without an excess of accompanying bitterness; generally, very smooth on the palate; creamy, modest amounts of acidity, and just a mild presence of noble-like hops; the bitterness from the roasted barley and malts is just enough. Lasting finish of milk and darker chocolates and roasted malt; nicely dry finish.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

1646,"2010-12-08",3.3,"Cool 11.2 oz. bottle with the grenade type pull cap.  Consumed fresh, the day it hit the shelves in Orlando.  Pours a dark mahogany color with some chestnut tinted translucency at the outer layers.  A quickly fleeting head of smooth khaki foam gives way to a thin surface film, as scant traces of lacing dot the glass in its wake.  The nose is something of a beautiful contradiction, dry and roasty on one hand, yet sweet, chocolaty, and fruity on the other.  Notes of toasted, perhaps even smoked barley are joined by coffee and dry cocoa in an effort to balance out sweeter chocolate, licorice, and burnt toffee elements.  Some unidentifiable dark fruit lends further sweetness in the background, while potent green, herbal, grassy hops lend an aromatic punch.  Flavors are largely the same, towing the line between dry roast bitterness and sweeter caramel and blackened malt notes.  Cocoa, coffee, and scorched caramel all again play their part, while a hint of salty brininess reminds me of an oyster stout.  Bitter, grassy hopping concentrates on the long, ashy, roasty finish.  Each swallow of the light-bodied (for a stout anyway) liquid brings with it a drier, more parching sensation, low carbonation leading into a papery, bitter end point.  Overall, I find this to be interesting and unique stuff, but nothing groundbreaking or even remotely impressive.  I want to call it sessionable, but that is largely untrue for me as the dryness gets to be excessive by the 3/4 mark of the drink.

1646,"2010-10-28",4.0,"Bottle with the pull-tab top.  Big stouty nose, rich chocolate and a ton of deep, dark, ashy roast, a rough-and-tumble foreign stout without any of the fruit or overblown alcohol.  Low but noticeable (and pleasant) hops and slight nuttiness.  Dark Coke pour with a short but lacing light brown head.  Taste is brutally dry with low-medium bitterness, gobs and gobs of roast and ash with some hop bite.  Key here is the depth of roast flavor - there are several levels to explore if one goes digging.  Light-medium body, a hint of acidic tang but thats backed off in favor of some roast barley (which is pushing the limits of the terms association with astringency toward territory governed by black patent).  A delightful experience, though probably not one for the daily pint: an earthy, uncompromisingly manly stout.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

The cork was a real SOB to remove--ended up chipping glass off the neck TWICE, using a garden variety wine bottle opener. This was after I gave up messing with the cork and just cut the top off. wtf? Impacted to say the least. But that’s neither here nor there wrt the beer, since I rinsed the shards off the top under the tap.
Pours a jet-black body under a thick, surging, moussy burnt tan head. Plenty of webby lacing left as it falls, but it sticks around to some degree for a good long while. Sweet licoricey nose...delectable. Creamy medium body. Plenty of chocolate and licorice on the mid-palate with whiffs of licorice darting in for cameos here and there. Long, mild, creamy finish.

1646,"2007-11-17",3.3,"Courtesy of Degarth. Thanks Joe. Was nice to see I hadnt rated this one, I had it at a previous tasting but must have never taken notes on it. Oh well, stoutie ratings rule. Brown body with a light tan head. Very fluffy, nice lasting power and lacing. Smell is a bit odd, some detergent or soap powder, also some fruity esters, licorice, chocolate, coffee and some charred malts. Flavor is similar, but thankfully dropping much or all of the detergent note, and leaving just a pretty good dry stout behind. Body is appropriate to style, drinks very easily. Finish is short to medium in length, a bit bitter or astringent with some coffee and chocolate notes.","Tampa, Florida, USA","Quake1028"

1646,"2004-10-08",3.4,"The DM & Hotstuffs European Honeymoon trip beer number 24. This draft brew from the Porterhouse brew pub in London poured a small sized head of tan colored fine to medium sized long lasting bubbles that left behind an excellent lacing and a opaque black brown colored body.  The aroma was mild with malt molasses aroma and a mouth feel that was tingly with a malty aftertaste.  The flavor contained notes of molasses and dark malts.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

1646,"2004-03-24",3.6,"A very unusual beer, this.  It's a black, almost impenetrable liquorice and roast malt beer with, for some untold reason, a huge dose of bittering and aroma hops.  This makes for a highly unusual but interesting beer.  Despite being served on pressure in the pub (and therefore a bit cold) it oozes flavour - burnt toast, roast barley, some liquorice and then that huge hop punch.  After trying it quite a few times I'm still not sure about this beer, but to give it it's dues it's a very interesting one.

Soft, mild stout-roasted barley, going over imperceptibly in a bitingly bitter, but nice STOUT. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, alcohol prominent. Gets a bit harsh in the end. Prize-stout.

The customers praised it highly and while they had it inside them they sang and shouted and sometimes lay down on the floor or on the roadway outside in a great stupor. these days the wrassler XXXX fights with yuppies in covent garden for £3 a pop. nitrified, which rips the guts out of the malt flavours, and seems to be at odds with their all-natural beer bullshit all over the menu. enormously hoppy, in fact so hoppy that it overpowers the roastiness and the malt flavours - initially pretty mild and smooth, then gets jumped on WWF style by shitloads of galena and nugget. not balanced but who gives a rats ring when its this bitter.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
