Plastic cask @ Kahdet Kasvot. Rated on 22.05.2010
Aroma is somewhat sweet with banana esthers, berries and licorice. Surprisingly the flavour is not sweet as sahtis usually are. It has anise, licorice, some strawberries and yeasty notes. Clean, solid and good sahti. Actually one of the best Ive had, but glasses of Hollola and Pihamaa Ive had in this very same place were even better.","Tampere, FINLAND","laiti"

Hazy brown colour with a minimal white head. Very beautiful appearance. The aroma is weak with banana, juniper and wheat.

2151,"2007-05-16",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2009 Draught (St. Urhos, Helsinki, ).
Thick muddy brown or caramel turbidity - as expected from sahti.
Not as much banana aroma as expected  Thick and sweet on the tongue, leaves a long richly roasted malt taste with a HUGE bitter and juniper finish. Excellent sahti. Final note - I did notice a bitter almond-like taste at the end. (7-3-8-4-14=3.6)
Rerate: 2009 version, Keg (St. Urhos, Helsinki, Sahti Days 2009)
(7-4-8-4-15=3.8) Rich banana aroma, sweet and treacly. Soft carbonation, some crispness. Loads of retronasal esters, banana by the bucketload. Pleasant sahti taste, all the sticky malts and banana, lots of juniper too. However, the sting is in the tail - this has lovely hops in the finish.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

Murky nut brown, creamy brown head. Sticky sugary, notes of juniper in the flavor. A bit citrusy. Light-bodied, refreshing easy to drink sahti. Hides alcohol very well. One of the best sahtis I have tasted but looks like it does not travel very well.","Pori, FINLAND","TBone"

A quite balanced and spicy sahti. Quite yeasty still, so might be better tomorrow after its been settled a bit.
(Draught, was 8-3-7-4-15=3.7) Murky orange-brown color with almost no head. Sweetish, quite smooth and pleasant banana-fruity aroma. Flowery-perfumy, sweet-sourish flavor with some vegetable hints. Very well-hidden alcohol. Sticky-sugary finish. Medium-bodied with low carbonation. This time it seemed to be in shape, and not bad at all (last rating was 2.2 because of sulphur).","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"
