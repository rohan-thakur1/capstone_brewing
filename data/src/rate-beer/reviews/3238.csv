3238,"2017-06-10",3.5,"12 oz. bottle, consumed on 5-21-17. ¬ì07/07/16,¬î presumably a bottled on date. Labeled as ¬ìAllagash Tripel Ale.¬î Pours an effervescent, medium to dark gold with a moderate amount of thin, short-lasting beige head. The shade and effervescence of the liquid is good, but the head is subpar in the initial pour. Final pour is hazier, darker, and duller, but the head is larger, creamier, more substantial, and longer lasting, and I bump the appearance to a 4. Pleasant, juicy, honeyed aroma. Scents of apple juice and Chardonnay. Buttery smell, not in a diacetyl way, but in an oaked white wine way. Quite sweet flavor with a dry finish. Honey and generic light-colored fruit juice. Melon and bitter orange peel. A touch of dust. Not sickly sweet but juicy-sweet in taste, but sweeter than I would prefer nonetheless. Hits the mark for a tripel, although it doesn¬ít seem to be particularly complex for the style, and it¬ís on the dull side. Medium to full body. A bit frothy and smooth but mostly forgettable (but not bad) palate effects. Easy to drink. Pleasant beer, well-made, doesn¬ít stray far from the Belgian model, but it does little for me.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

With each progressive tasting on separate nights, this beer got better and better. I could pick up the subtle aroma, sweetness (fruit, honey), and light herbals. The last of the four was very good -- I really enjoyed it. I would put this just shy of Ommegang¬ís Hennepin Saison and Gnomegang Blonde Ale.

3238,"2016-08-14",3.5,"750 mL bottle shared by ebone1988. Thanks, I guess. You and that fucking book. The pour is a darker foggy golden color with a big pillowy white head that leaves some pretty good lace as it falls to a thick and dense cap. The aroma is decent. There is a lot of yeast and traditional tripel notes. A light honey and some decent malts are not too shabby. There is a light fruitiness that isn¬ít bad, but it¬ís just something that I know isn¬ít my jam. The flavor is full of much more clove and spice that the aroma hides. I dislike this pretty heavily. I wish there were more banana in it to hide the clove. The spice is complex and not awful, but the clove dominates. The mouth feel is a tough heavy and has a nice bubbly carbonation before drawing out on a spicy clove and interesting aftertaste.

A: Pours a semi-hazy yellow color. The head is a finger high, with a bone white shade and a creamier texture than what I¬ím used to from the style. Its staying power isn¬ít fantastic, unfortunately, but it does leave a good ring of lacing down the glass.

S: Oh wow, this is quite intriguing. After being immediately poured, it¬ís a rather peppery, bready smell - let it sit, though, and it develops great fruit notes. It¬ís heavily skewed towards bananas and lemons in particular. Candied sugar is quite prevalent. In fact, my only complaint is that it could be a little more subdued. Still, there¬ís no denying this has a wonderful aroma.

T: The flavors in general are pretty uniform - that is, it doesn¬ít start with flavor X and finish with flavor Y. Its notes of banana, wheat, candied sugar, lemon, and black pepper are consistent from start to finish. Some suggestions of herbal bitterness try to sneak their way into the back end, and this singular note is enough to convince me I¬ím drinking something very, very good.

M: It¬ís fairly sweet, and slightly less carbonated than its Belgian counterparts. The lingering sugar is felt, but there¬ís just enough dryness to help this go down easily. I think because the sweetness is rather chalky and coarse, it doesn¬ít stick to the palate like other high-gravity beers do.

O: This is a very solid tripel. Honestly, with many ¬íMurican made Belgian styles, there¬ís something - maybe subtle, maybe shameless, but it¬ís there - that tells me ¬íyep, this is as ¬íMurican as apple pie and obesity.¬í But with this, I¬íd swear it¬ís as Belgian as french fries if served to me blindly. It¬ís balanced, delicate, and easy to drink; that¬ís enough for me.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Medium body with a lively carbonation that fills the mouth with meringue-like foam. Alcohol burn is there and keeps it interesting, but doesn¬ít dominate.

I poured this one into mostly chalices over the years but also had it in a couple tulips from time to time. There wasn¬ít any noticeable differences between the two.
The appearance had a nice looking hazy golden yellow color to it with a decent transparency about it. Some light carbonation is seen rising.
The smell had a nice arrangement of spiced apples, iced apples, earthy yeast, and some Belgian sugars.
The taste takes all of those flavors and combines them to make a wonderful complexity about this beer.
The palate was fairly light but made me want to think it came across closer to a medium on the body. The carbonation has a decent acceptable sharpness about it.
Overall, I say this was a great tripel well worthy of having again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3238,"2014-06-10",4.0,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 2/6/14 and came as part of a four-pack for $11.99 ($3 per bottle or $0.25 per ounce).

Appearance: Bright, almost glowing shade of lemon-skin yellow. Fairly clear with visible carbonation. Pours to an average sized, white, soapy head which laces and retains fairly well.

Smell: Banana, flowers, vanilla, and some spice.

Taste: There¬ís a definite difference between American Belgian-style tripels and authentic tripels from Belgium. It¬ís not that one¬ís better or worse, they¬íre both unique and enjoyable in their own way. Allagash Tripel is definitely one of the better American offerings on the style as it¬ís traditional at the core, though a bit different in the details.

The palate here is pretty familiar, though plenty tasty. Banana, clove, light citrus and tropical fruits are all quite prominent up front. The Belgian yeast plays a major component in the taste profile as it imparts a perfume or soapy quality. There¬ís a richer sweetness on the finish, akin to rum, as well as an intense peppery spice (the alcohol has a lot to do with this, too). Light bitterness through the middle helps the transition from the light sweetness to the spicy crescendo. Overall, an highly enjoyable, well-balanced palate.

Drinkability: Allagash Tripel is pretty potent at 9% ABV, and that intensity makes itself known via the robust palate, but also in the lingering warming sensation. The mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly, though it does go down quite smoothly. A lingering, peppery dryness in the aftertaste is to be expected, but it¬ís easily tolerable.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

The taste starts with a slight granny-smith apple, that carries as oat and honey notes start to bloom. There are slight notes of aforementioned tropical fruits, but more on the unripe/sour-ish side.

Aroma is passionfruit and honey foremost followed by a hint of banana and strong clove with maybe some citrus in there...can¬ít tell if it is citrus or the uncommon combo of honey and passionfruit.  Taste is so amazingly balanced.  The passionfruit and honey dance off the clove to make the clove less offensively strong then I typically feel.  Banana and some other fruits finish it off with the lightest sweetness. Is carbonated just right for the palate, full and not watery but still smooth. Only adjustment on ratings on re-rate are taste from 8 to 9, everything else identical.","Sevierville, Tennessee, USA","BadAprilia1000"

3238,"2012-02-23",3.1,"From notes.  First reviewed 5/14/2010.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip. Thanks to Flipadelphia for the sample.

This bottle pours a hazy golden color with a 4 cm frothy white head. A thin film remains and sheds some light lace on the glass.

Initially I get a strong whiff of straw, followed by a lighter honey and booziness. Perplexing; I would have expected more. As it warms, I get more honey and more alcohol, but still nothing special. 

Sweet honey pale malt hit the tongue up front, with a blend of spices (cloves, coriander, and a bit of pepper). Belgian yeast is also present. Herbal hops finish the off the flavor palette. Ok, but underwhelming flavor.

Above average carbonation gives it a crisp feel. Medium bodied.

Golden, hazy yellow with a billowy and creamy white head, at least one finger, that gradually settles leaving layers of lace stuck on the glass. Belgian yeast, sugar, grains, alcohol, coriander, banana. Fairly smooth but the alcohol lends a bit of a bite, slightly sweet throughout, some malt, banana and coriander at the end, becomes fairly dry.

Beer is creamy and sticky on the palate with a nice soft carbonation.  Taste is downright astounding.  All of the aforementioned aroma qualities are represented in beautiful balance plus some honey, marmalade, and just a fantastic warm, boozey sensation to boot.

The carbonation was light and smooth, which carried the sweetness well. The sweetness wasn¬ít extreme, but was rather soft like a banana (as everyone says) with a very slight tart.

Pours into my tulip a hazy gold with hues of orange. the head is rocky and white and recedes to nice Belgian-styled lacing.

The smell is authentic, yeasty ad fruity with a little bit of spice. Smells like a Tripel should, a feat that most American brewers fail at.

The taste is more of a letdown. It is herbal and sweet with some spice and bitterness but this is too sweet and clean for a tripel, it is sterile, like other American versions.

The mouthfeel is a tad watery, drinkability is decent theough the alcohol isn¬ít completely unmasked.

It is a decent attempt.

T: This is one spicy beer. Spicy foremost, then citric and pine. Chewy yeast is very apparent. Next is a grassy, earthy undertone. Hops are not the focus of this beer. They instead play a support role to bring out the best in the malt mix.

Of course, the standard large foamy Belgian head fills almost half the tulip glass, with a pillar of carbonation rising from the center of the glass where the stem meets the bowl. The aroma is of sweet citrus fruit, candy & sugar. 1st sip is of sweet candied citrus fruit (orange, lemon, tangerine) peel & honey, followed by a surprisingly dry, white wine-like finish. The citrus peel flavor reappears on the swallow & lingers tantalizingly afterwards. There is a champagne sparkle on the tongue.

3238,"2009-08-09",3.8,"Gold, orange, and amber melt before my eyes while a fluffy cloud drifts and lingers atop a sunshine smile. White tufts fade lazily into a thick puddle centered in the middle of her glassy surface while an equally thick collar traces the edges of her confine. I tease her shimmering depths but receive no lace in thanks, just a thicker abundance of clumpy foam. What I do receive in spades though is a nose bursting with Belgian-style Tripel esters: yeast, spice, ripe fruits stewed and caramelized in a sweet mixture of honey, maple, brown sugar and cinnamon. Soft white bread offers gentle support while pungent cantaloupe, mango, star fruit, and kiwi teeter on the edge of over-ripeness. Flowers bloom and herbal essences drift by on a passing breeze while meringue toasts, piecrust is molded, and lemoncello cream fills someone¬ís aperitif glass. Abundantly aromatic and intense, all her esters and aromas mingle together in exquisite precision, drawing me into her beery embrace like a hapless seaman to the siren¬ís call. For such a rambunctious nose, her body and mouthfeel is super soft, so much so to make the finest cottons blush in envy. The freshest white breads still warm from the oven, steam rises from their brown skin. Starting off soft, she finishes with dry hops, dry lemon, orange, and mango skins replete with moisture-retardant lingering pith. A green, dry finish, her middle is also sweet, tropical, and grassy with damp dew, coconut, toasted flatbread, lemon zest, and floral essence. I find it intriguingly tasty how much her palate differs from her nose. The sweetness is subdued while my tongue tingles under a dry, toasty, green, dewy, tropical assault. I forgo the pen and paper for the rest of my bottle, choosing to just sit, sup, and savor.


Unique, but still a solid offering from Allagash. Their Tripel is not one of my more favored offerings in this particular style, but she is still a quality contribution none-the-less. I plan on quaffing future bottles of the Allagash Tripel in future dates, but not as frequently as their White.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Restrained nose shows some honeyed grain, fresh pineapple (not sweetened from can) and nice hop spice that compliments the dryness well.  While the fruit continues on the palate, it never becomes cloying or tooti fruity. The esters never get to heady and balance is held to a level of seduction that many Belgians don¬ít achieve.  Yes I just said that.  A certain richness to the body does let the drinker know that this beer isn¬ít afraid to take the recliner in the living room without asking.  Well planned carbonation level gives this beer a spring in its step without jumping to a gallop. Honeyed malt and hop spice finish cleanly.  Very digestable.

Smell: Spiced and sweetened sliced bananas greet the nose first, then enter some fruity notes of white peaches, Golden Delicious apples, pineapple, and maybe, just maybe even a bit of bitter orange. Background waft of whole, smile-inducing booze.

A single, solitary drop of vanilla. Sharp floral touches alongside some hop bitterness. Peppery alcohol tries to hit you with a hammer, but the other various flavors try to keep it at bay.

Flavors flesh out more than the aroma- definitely some fruit in there (melons, lemons, apples) along with some heavy yeasty notes, a fair amount of booze, and a smooth candy sweet malt character.  Very well balanced on the flavors.  Palate is crisp and dry, clean finish.  Very good tripel.","framingham, Massachusetts, USA","twitcher"

The taste is obviously very young and fresh with lots of alcohol heat, strong fruity esters, and a touch of sweetness. Hints of sweet orange peel, cloves, coriander, ginger, and bread, with a slight acidic burn.

Some yeast and pepper in the nose, with some malts that don¬ít get in the way. When it¬ís young, there¬ís more pepper and I¬ím digging that right now - almost a pumped up saison imperial or something.

Vinous, fruity, yeast and sweet malt flavors are well balanced by some toasted nut, caramel, peppery alcohol, and a hint of bitter herbs. Body is on the lighter side of light-medium, alcohol-tingly, and smooth but disconcertingly airy and effervescent at the same time.

3238,"2008-01-30",3.7,"May 2006 - Batch 74.   Pour was pale yellow with nice, but quickly dissipating head, minimal lacing.  Aroma and flavor was spicey and wheaty.  Flavoe might have been a tad too sweet and very peppery.  Touches of banana and strong yeast presence as well.  Pretty darned good for an American attempt (better than Golden Monkey), but definitely isn¬ít top notch.","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"
3238,"2008-01-27",4.2,"My first thought was ""I am pouring silk into a glass!"".  The head came out very silky.  Slightly amber/yellow.  Small uniform bubbles puff into a cloud like pillow of awesomeness.  After a minute or two the head quickly dissipates into a thin layer of bubbles that form a prairie on a far away fantastic planet.  What I mean is that it falls unevenly.  The color of the elixir is a light golden.  It is cloudy enough to be completely opaque.  Nothing can be seen through the glass with the exception of light.  Holding in front of a source of light makes the beer appear to generate its own happy glow.

The aroma is sweet and a touch heady.  It has that indefinable (until I review more beers:) scent that I correspond with Belgium beers.  Almost sickly sweet; as if a honeysuckle has been sitting in the sun for a few hours.  Nothing freshly plucked about it.  Although this beer (on the top of the smell stack) does have some fresh sweetness.  The smell overall is a touch too light - my nose is yearning for just a hair more.

The flavor hits me first with the sweetness then sharply drops off and my taste buds hit a near vertical wall of this sweet-dropping-off effect.  Then the taste takes a visual jump and comes back a little smoky.  From the third taste on this sharp drop and rise effect mellows out into a more smooth visualization.  The taste is a slow climb, then a slow decline of flavor.  Almost like a slight frown.  But there are no frowns about this brew - it¬ís frickin delicious.  It hits me as fruity - almost like a dried apricot that was rubbed with some raisins.  This beer is incredibly drinkable.  I¬ím glad the bottle is more than just one pour.  A quick swallow sometimes brings a bit of sharpness to the back of the throat.  So this is definitely a beer to drink slowly.

The palate is smooth with a touch of tickle from the carbonation.  It slides smoothly, yet it is still thin.  It says to me ""I am very drinkable, but I have substance, so take heed and don¬ít drink me like water"".  I feel like as I near the end of the glass the palate becomes more viscous, but still very slippery.

Overall I truly enjoy this beer.  I would drink it again.  The bottle is numbered by batch number.  I am partaking in batch #102.  One thing to note is that there is a slight sign of mold on the top of the cork (underneath the metal pull down).  It¬ís dry, but seems that it was wet at one point; maybe during transportation?  I have been storing the beer on its side.  The solids in the beer fell to the side and stuck to the bottle.  It doesn¬ít seem that any solids make it into the beer, but I¬ím a true believer in not trying to avoid the solids - I believe they are part of the experience of a particular beer.  On a side note - this beer goes very well with ""Neutral Milk Hotel"" on the speakers.  As I near the end of this fantastic experience I note that I can feel the alcohol.","USA","quantumtigger"

The body was cloudy yellowish orange and a lot of foam formed atop it in the tulip.  The smell was a tropical forest full of flowering trees.  The flavor contained banana, oranges, white pepper, cookie dough, and lemon juice.  The clean and majestic taste avoided the one flaw I¬íve dreaded in American versions of the style, that of being too sweet.  The dusty, yeasty dryness was quite welcome and refreshing.  Soothingly rich in the mouth, and well carbonated, so resounding burps abounded.  The label says that this is well suited for cellaring, and it would definitely make an interesting experiment.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
3238,"2007-12-01",3.3,"I had this on tap at my local, in proper glassware. It looked wonderful:  a cute, foamy head with creamy, paint- like lacing over a rich honey-gold body. The aroma was strong and rich also, almost too much so--very sweet and yeasty. The taste was very strong as well and in the same way, with lots of sweet fruitiness and yeast. Hops aren¬ít very evident at all, but the beer does get a little more bitter the further you go into it. The kick wasn¬ít obvious at first, but quite powerful by the time I was done. The palate was the biggest problem for me, and the main reason I can¬ít make this a 4. To tell the truth, I had the same problem with this that I have had with so many hefeweizens. The palate is just way too full and bloaty for me, with much more carbonation and more yeast than I can handle comfortably. In fact, the palate was so heavy that it was hard for me to finish the glass. Combine that with a very strong kick and a very strong flavor and you have a beer that is quite a handful for many drinkers. This is a good beer, no question, and many rate it higher, but I can¬ít in all honesty do the same. It¬ís very much worth a try, especially for lovers of Belgians, but give me something a bit less bloat-provoking, please.","USA","Allie"

The pour is a cloudy golden with a pale white lasting head. The aroma is spicy with a caramel sweetness and pear citrus. As the brew hits the tongue, the citrusy pear and orange is slightly dominant over the spiciness, but not by much. As the brew progresses its decent down the tongue into the throat, the spiciness becomes more apparent, overpowering the citrus and sweetness. As it passes the tongue, hops qualities surprisingly arise along with a quick burst of spiciness. In the end, the hops, spice, citrus, and sweetness levels nearly evenly.

The flavour is as fruity as the nose implies but instead of honey I¬ím getting a caramel malt backbone. Slight bitterness arises from the yeasty complex and alcohol content, but not in a way that is offensive. There is warth throughout the taste but most notable in the finish.

An appealing nose, tropical fruits, honey and subtle banana, medicinal herbs that mesh with the estery alcohol. Everything is pretty much as advertised.

Begins with warm spicy alcohol mildly stinging the tongue, followed by honey grains and candied sugar. The alcohol keeps it¬ís warmth through out the taste. Tart tropical fruits in the middle, the yeast turns an earthy spice in the end. Finishes dry, pale grains and earthy, fruity yeast, along with a palate cleansing effect from the spicy alcohol.

Notes of candy sugar, ample yeast, tart and sweet tropical fruits, dusty pepper, honey, appleskins, touches of cloves and well integrated alcohol. Lovely. The flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, quite yeasty, with fruit notes even further accentuated by a simple, forthright alcohol component. wheated malt is plentiful in character, though I get the feeling this is an illusion of sorts. The finish is smooth, sweet at first, then very dry and lightly sticky. Mouthfeel is mildly sticky, medium to medium-full bodied, moderately to highly carbonated and very luxurious, without any flavor clumping together or seeming muddled by excessive sugary sweetness.

Batch #94

Allagash Tripel Reserve a hazy golden that turns straw when held to the light. Tiny carbonation bubbles rise quickly to the thin wispy white cap that sits up top. Really not much in the looks department.

The aroma makes up for the lack of appearence. Sweet rip peaches and tangerines start things off. Biscuity malts are faint and in the background. Hint¬ís of candi sugar come forward. There¬ís a zesty sweet snap in there from the tangerines.

Flavor is similiar to the aroma with ripe juicy fruits coming from every direction. Sweet tangerine zestiness up front with a mild dusty yeastiness. Candi sugar and mild alcohol come through mid palate but are quickly overtaken by juicy peaches on the finish. Very nicely done.

Lively mouthfeel with prickly carbonation and a zestiness that awakens the tastebuds. Each sip leaves me wanting another.

Easy drinker for the abv involved. Refreshing and tasty.

A solid offering from Allagash that has that X factor I can¬ít put my finger on but keep wanting more. Very nicely done.

3238,"2007-05-06",4.1,"Peel the label off and it may be hard to convince me that this tripel is brewed in the US and not in Belgium, from the style of bottle to the cork to the taste. The beer poured honey colored and hazy with a good size white head. It is definitely active and effervescent. It smells of bananas, cloves and bubble gum. Tastes are wheaty and sweet with spices. As it warms there is a perfuminess to the taste foloowed by a candied sweetness and a honey like finish. Mouthfeel starts as crisp with a alcohol punch in the finish and as it warms it becomes more smooth and mellowed. Overall highly drinkable and dangerous.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","hoppymeal"

3238,"2007-03-19",1.9,"On tap at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse, thanks mtoast.  Allagash XXX , I¬íve been waiting to taste this. This beer pours hazy pale yellow but there are no precipitants within. Has a nice white creamy head but it also has some medium and larger bubbles that prompts an uneven foam. The aroma is mild, slightly sweet and lacking of the typical beery yeast aroma so common in today¬ís beers. Oooh, the initial flavor impact is quite strong, but not as strong as the 9% would indicate. Alky bitter on the beginning and alky bitter to the palate.  The alky content is certainly prevalent in this brew. Nice lacing on the sides of the glass as you drink. Tho this is above average bitterness, it is not quite as oppressive in the alky as that Southern Tier  trippel I recently had. Southern tier is much less refined than this brew, the Allagash lacks the in your face characteristic. The finish is medium high bitterness that can not be appreciated by my lager loving girlie taste buds. It reminds a little of bitter cough medicine. This brew does not stand a chance against white Chimay or Grimbergen Blonde. Slightly below par when compared to Victory Golden monkey as far as enjoyablity goes.  I¬ím not a real fan of trippels but since I have been spoiled by Chimay and Grimbergen, I now expect more from this style.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

3238,"2006-10-21",4.0,"I was very impressed with this beer, from start to finish, and if I can find it, I will purchase it again.

The packaging was a large, cork-sealed single serve.  Even before I opened it, this beer demonstrated a significant amount of sediment.  I hung onto it for several months before drinking.

Poured a hazy gold with abundant white head (appealing).  Odor was floral citrusy, and pleasing, but not outstanding.

Flavor was very good and the highlight of the beer...there was a grapey chardonnay sweetness balanced with a wine-like sourness.  There was no hop content and limited malt flavor but the flavor was very good and (to my limited knowledge) very appropriate for the style.  I was impressed with this beer and plan on having it again, when it¬ís once again available to me.

This is truly the best tasting Belgian any-style ale I¬íve had and one of the best overall.  I think it was like $7 for 750ml too...excellent.

Thick-hazed amber with a huge & rocky, bubblicious head and lively, lasting carbonation.  Musty-basement, sour banana, tomato sauce with lemon and white bread dough aromas. Flavor starts with a candy sweetness and ends with an almost-grassy, bitter-sourness. Explosively-creamy mouthfeel with big alcohol in the finish causing some astringency on the palate. For the most part, though, the alcohol is well-masked in aroma and initial flavor.
Pared down review: Bubblicious musty tomato candy explosively-creamy.

Strong citrus and yeast taste on a beer that seemed almost wheat like.  Very flavourful citrus actually.  Very light mouthfeel and bubbly carbonation.

3238,"2005-05-09",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2005 July 8th 2004: First of a long series of sampling.  Shining golden hue, honest rocky white head becomes a never disappearing 1cm foam. Superb noble hops in the aroma. It feels very natural, grassy and extremely floral. I smell a spice blend, but I can‚Äôt put any names. It smells very airy.. In mouth, once again this charming floral profile comes out very dry, champaigny almost. Spices flavor from the fermentation get a bit more defined (pepper, sage, cloves) while the malt base appear honeyish and fruity (but once again hard to put any names). Very bitter spicy and grassy finish. Pillow-soft mouthfeel, fluffy, creamy, round. Incredibly balanced and holding much more class than I can handle. I didn‚Äôt expect that much, this is a gem. Thanks Stephen! 

Everytime I try this again I‚Äôm blown away. Vastly superior in terms of expanding creamy tiny bubbled velvety mouthfeel. If the nose was more expressive, this would be very close to perfection. It builds a superb foam that lasts as long as you‚Äôre willing to sit on it. The sides of the glass stay white all along while the core at the middle digs a crater. Is that rockiness or what? And the taste... woah, succulent honeysuckle, very spicy, complex and champaigny. Only a 10 renders justice. Too elegant, shining and well-edged to be true with just a hint of alcohol to remind you it‚Äôs a tripel. Classy and effortlessly among the best.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

The cloudiness does not distract; rather, it adds intrigue to the imminent intake of this beverage.

First sip was dry with a substantial bite.  Very floral flavor with some citrus (mostly grapefruit), some vanilla and quite a yeasty bite.  It finished dry, astringent and a little bitter.  Not too bad.  As it warmed (or as my tastebuds started to numb from the 9%), it became sweet and dry.  Honey, banana and vanilla flavors took over.  When warmer, it finished very smooth.

Huge clouds of bubbles are swirling up to the top of my glass.  How am I supposed to take a sip from a beer who¬ís froth is taller than that of a cappucino?  The aroma is a very nice combination of honey, grapes, and a touch of banana.  Taste is dry white wine with some spice, not too sweet at all.

This was one of those beers that you think ""hell yeah!"" as soon as you taste the beer. Yeasty and wheaty, with a nice trifecter of citrus-sweet-and-smooth.

Appearance: slightly hazed, pure golden hue, some bubbling carbonation, with a large and lovely, fluffy cloud of foam on top, obviously home to a myriad of tiny angels awaiting their chance to entrance the senses.
And it is good work that they do!
Aroma: intoxicating! Senses-filling, flooding, uplifting! Rich, delicious, heady, spicy, sweet, fruity (lemon, orange, pineapple, peach), complex, and invigorating. Bewitching, beguiling, bewildering! And pretty good, too!
Taste: huge, yet soft, and sensual attack of hops, that just as soon turns to an orgy on the tongue, nothing but goodness and delight coming from it, a paroxysm of pleasure occurs, sending jolt after jolt of joy down through the nervous system and every sense receptor.
These flavors, these temptations, sweet succor to any thirst or any lack of happy feeling, they continue again and again every time lip meets cup, and ale meets tongue, again and again, without pause. Mmmmm, is all my mind can conjure to relate the exact consequences of consumption, and maybe it¬ís that 9% ABV of this 750ml bottle (1/2 to go, and the night is still young, where to go from such bliss?) of perfectly brewed tripel?
Everything¬ís in it¬ís heaven in this brew, the malt, the hops, the booze, sugar, yeast, every little imp that does it¬ís special magic has earned it¬ís fairy dust in the production of this very fine golden ale!

3238,"2004-07-28",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2004 I rated this once about two weeks ago but I lost the sheet of paper I wrote it on. This turned out to be something of a blessing as it gave me an excuse to buy this wonder of a beer again. This is a very pale triple--I¬íll call it golden rather than yellow because it tastes good. The first pour is crystal clear but there¬ís a touch of sediment in later glasses. The head is nice and fluffy, creamy with tiny, tiny bubbles and it lasts long enough to leave thousands of of drippy little spots of lace on the side of my chalice. The nose is somewhat surprising--a bit more hops than I expected, almost-hints of citrus along with actual hints of bread and honey but not much if any of that banana they talk about in the description. The palate is nice and thick, some slight stickiness is made more pronounced by the bitterness in the finish. This is really an excellent beer. I enjoy the extra bit of hops Allagash has added. It gives the beer an American spin without becoming some ham-fisted monster and still staying relatively true to the style.

Whata ya know? I found my old rating of this. It was much higher (4.5). I thought the beer tasted a lot thinner the second go round..... Cloudy golden, gorgeous creamy white head that lasts forever and leaves huge sheets of lace. Nose is mild, slightly bready with a hint of sweet spice and some floral notes.

Cellar pick - 2003 bottle.  Batch #50.  Sampled: 50 degrees.  After reading my initial review of this beer some 4 years ago, I have now come to terms with what that taste actually is: the yeast.  And now that my palate has changed over the course of 6 years, it is obvious to me that the yeast Allagash uses is actually my favorite part of their beers.   Pulled the cork out of this one and thought it might have been dead, but after pouring it, it is clear that the carbonation was just hiding!  Straw yellow color with a big white head on it.  The smells of bananas and sweet fruits are still there perhaps a bit less pronounced.  Tasting this beer is fabulous.  Sweet, easy to drink, very little alcohol burn (which is usually present in a fresher bottle).  Damn this is good.  Very dry and leaves you wanting more.  The 9% is no where to be found in this beer.  I am not even a fan of tripels, but I feel I must bump my score after trying this one!  This is the reason Rob Todd is a premier brewer in this country.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

 Pours with a beautiful and vibrant golden body, hues of orange, it looks like a jar honey, but with a colossal mountain of snow encrusted atop. The aroma is citric and sweet, orange blossoms and honeysuckle accompany notes of clove and black peppercorns; all can be found along side a freshly cut tangerine, a ripened plum, a doughy yeastiness, and a modest amount of musty barnyard hay!

Using my Allagash tulip glass to drink this heavenly nectar, it pours a burnished gold that is perfectly clear from a careful pour. A frothy, off-white head starts out thick, then slowly shrinks down to small cap. It's easily brought back up again with a simple swirl. The lace looks a lot like soap suds overlooked on a car window in the middle of a hot, sticky summer.  Wonderfully complex aroma with suggestions of spicy fruits, banana, grape, clove, phenolics, bready yeast, alcohol, and a musty earthy note. Despite this wide array of scents, the aroma comes across as sweet. Stunning...  The flavor is sweet and spicy, with lots of fruitiness and honey on the forefront. After the initial rush of sweetness, the flavor shifts to a slighty phenolic one, along with a small burst of black pepper spiciness. The clove, yeast, and musty flavors are in there too, but play secondary roles and stay mostly in the background. The tail end has a rush of warming alcohol, which is highlighted by a touch of hops. Again, stunning¬Ö  This brew is highly carbonated, but settles to a creamy, soft mouthfeel that is just a bit prickly on the tongue. The body is on the lighter side of medium.

Surprising dry and crisp for a large tripel. Medium to full-bodied, it has a lively mouthfeel and a bit alcoholic feel.

3238,"2003-03-05",4.3,"Tonight was a good night. ""Why,"" you ask? Because I discovered this beer and I discovered 2 hours of Kids in the Hall on Comedy Central. While the Allagash Tripel was all spiced cream and fruits (mostly bananas and peaches), Kids in the Hall is Funny. While Allagash is made in Maine, the Kids in the Hall are Canadian. Oakes is Canadian as well but while this beer's beautiful bright golden amber body sparkled with constant effervescence and the thick, creamy white head sheeted and even chunked the side of the glass, Oakes is not funny. At least not in the cross-dressing, irreverent, absurdist humor way that the Kids in the Hall were. Damn this is a fine beer, probably my favorite in the style.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

3238,"2003-01-26",3.3,"One of the more interestingly flavored Belgians I have had to date. With the appearance of a peach-orange sunrise and foamy head--the rating experience started auspiciously. The aroma was of wood, yeast, coriander? (and maybe unripe banana peel), and definitely conjured up memories of witbiers, with an initially indiscernable tangy quality present in flavor as well. After some skunky notes aired and a harsh raw estery quality dissipated, the distinct tastes were easier to identify--this is certainly a complex ale. Again, wood and a witbieresque interplay were significant factors. After at least half the tasting spent in bafflement trying to decipher the tangy X quality I realized it was grapefruit--which dominated the experience. I don't care for grapefruit, but still a decent beer.

However, of the few strong Belgians that I have had - this one has to be the best.  It did not overwhelm me with alcohol - though it is quite present! The most obvious flavor coming through to me is sweet honey with a strong spice finish. The pour is a show in itself with effervescent bubbles flowing through the entire 750 ml bottle.

As it warms, pepper and cloves add bite, though I never did get the banana fruit that often comes along with these spice tastes in a wheat beer.

This beer initially had stong citrus notes but also touched upon the sweeter part of my palate.  I found this in itself to be unique.  Finished strong with a full body.   This is a wonderful beer to someone who does not even generally care for Belgian beers.  Rerate.  Upon retrying this, it continually delivers. I buy this beer often.  I love the balance, and the herbal liqueur-like flavor.  Epluche Culotte may be more complex, but this has the balance and spiciness I enjoy most in a tripel.  I find this to be one of the least watery tripels as well.  Rerate  I suppose I should say more.  I think, of all the good beers I have had in the last 3 years, I may have purchased this one the most frequently.  That is, in part, due to its broad availability near where I live, but I think it is more due to how damned good it is.  I could never tell this wasnt made in Belgium, in a blind taste.  Wonderful balance throughout.  Maybe the best example of a beer that dosent have to use sheer force of flavor and body to come across as good.  It¬ís in the balance, the yeast, the spice, the delicate flavors that play about on the palate.  Some of the newer batches have moments of, perhaps, too much sweetness, and the alcohol does show up at times, but as far as aging potential goes, this stuff is superb.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

I certainly recommend this beer to anybody with taste.","Old Town, Maine, USA","beerman991979"
