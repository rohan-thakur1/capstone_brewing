2796,"2012-03-08",4.7,"Fantastic beer, if incredibly hard to find. Had this gem fresh in Prague in a small underground bar. First noticed was the rich color- a beautiful copper, with a light head and sparkling clear liquid. A bright aroma, with caramel and cereal malts, floral and perhaps citrus hops, and a definite, but not overpowering alcohol taste. Medium body, light and soft on the palate, playing well off the sides of the tongue. Fantastically well balanced, both crisp and sweet, without being overly bitter or heavy. One of the single best Czech beers in my opinion, and I would drink it all night were it not for the significant alcohol content. 

That said- its been hard to tell if this is, in fact, the same beer as others have rated. The brewery advertized as a 13% beer, and this is the only Czech ""Demon"" I found.

Not bad, not exciting.Earlier Rating: 9/21/2009 Total Score: 3.2Bought at the Beershop tent at the Rujanfest in Zagreb. Poured an amber/red body with an thick small off white head that went away at a medium pace. A fine sweet malty nose, caramelly, weak notes of cocoa. Malty, grainy taste, some very lightly bitter hopiness, a bit rustic, which shows some lemony notes. The aftertaste is hoppy too but again not all that bitter. In two minds about this, definitely not bad, but something about it just doesnt sit all that well with me. Still, cant say its not a quality beer.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"

Appearance didnt promise anything special with its reddish brown colour and small head. However, the aroma was quite delicate with caramel, spicy hops and some malts, but the best quality with this beer was definately the taste. A certain woody taste was obvious right from the start and throughout the beer, accompanied with caramel, spicy hops and a bit alcohol to underline the beers entire character. Finish was fine and pretty bitter with a hint of alcohol. Delicious! Soft and easily creamy palate.

Underlying hops are genuinely full of czech character, oily, grassy, not overexpressive, but positioned how and where they need to be and luckily cutting short the sweetness aspirations it shows in the first half.

2796,"2006-02-11",2.9,"Bottle. Amber brown body, with a small white head. Aroma of tangy caramel malt, light note of fusels. Sweet saccharine wisps. Flavour is dull, sweet generic European character. Tart toasty bite, lingering dry aftertaste. Fruity notes as it warms up with light notes of pilsener-esque European hops bitterness that seems out of place. Average palate. Not bad but not my cup of tea. Thanks JoeMcPhee.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
2796,"2006-02-07",3.2,"Copper with a decent head.  Smooth, hoppy, flavour with a great malty base.  I even tasted some whisky-ish flavour.  Smooth all around.","Summerland, British Columbia, CANADA","HazelRah"

2796,"2005-09-24",3.2,"Pours a rich copper colour with no head to speak of. Sweet malty nose. The taste has a  rather interesting progression of flavours. First it starts out sweet then the malt kicks in followed by grassy hops. I found it quite drinkable as made my way through it.","coquitlam, British Columbia, CANADA","frink"
2796,"2005-09-04",3.5,"From the bottle: (but just a regular crown cap) Pours clear copper with a slight off white head that fades. Malt dominates the aroma with , toasted marshmallow and toffee as well as bready and molasses tones.
Flavour is lighter than expected. Malty and slightly nutty  through the middle. carbonation rides the back end. Slight sour aftertaste. Very smooth.","Lakeville, Minnesota, USA","Trev"
2796,"2005-08-13",3.6,"500 ml bottle.  Deep copper colour, thin white head.  Nice sweet malty aroma, brown sugar, toffee, with the complexity that only a decoction can give you.  Dark bready malt flavour, fairly sweet, light nuttiness and some caramel and toffee.  Silky smooth and easy to drink.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
2796,"2005-06-19",3.5,"Clear and coppery, medium head. Im not sure what this beer is marketed as, but it comes across as a tasty moderately hoppy ale. Well balanced and refreshing.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

2796,"2005-05-26",2.8,"The Lure:An amber colour obviously for this polotmavé, with fast diminishing head and scarce lacing. Peppery hops pierce the dry malt husks, but fail to create any vigor and interest.

The Festivities:Peppery caramel dominates the mostly malty average-sized body. A dryish grassy hop finish and light toastiness precede the peachy fruitiness. All is united in softness, nothing is wrong, but this is just boring.

Transcendence:The demons gotten fat and complacent methinks.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
2796,"2005-03-19",3.4,"Bottled. Pale copper coloured, not much head. Very bready aroma with hints of caramel. The same in flavour, with hints of hops. Very refreshing beer and nice palate. Hard to find now, so I hope I had bought more if this one last year.","Vasa, FINLAND","oh6gdx"

2796,"2004-08-16",2.2,"(On tap). My notes say this beer has a hoppy, weird skunky/creamy-lactic aroma. Perhaps this is the caramel everybody is talking about..... For some reason I didnt notice.

Malty bread and caramel, plus a hint of stale canal water and conditioned British ale aroma. Medium light smooth body. Mild bitter start moving to maltier sweeter middle. You keep thinking you are going to get a hoppy zingy lift somewhere but it never comes. Finish is on the weak side with a touch of that brit pub ale feel to it again. Actually that is kinda interesting in itself. Hummm. . . is it better than the Starobrno Cerveny Drak. Probably yes.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","OlJuntan64"
