1693,"2017-02-13",3.5,"Bouteille 33cl, BB 2018, batch # G278. Merci Pierre T.
Dorée/orangée présentant un léger trouble, col blanc avec qcq sédiments éparses.
Arôme au nez distinct de brett, le tout étant renforcé par les effluves de Chardonnay et une certaine sécheresse au nez niveau boisé. Ces derniers offrent un aspect funk assez marqué couvrant un peu trop le côté houblonnage à cru.
Palais au profil sec qui met de suite en avant un côté brett et vin blanc marqués. Le tout est assez râpeux avec un boisé de chêne français qui accentue cette sensation. Le tout oscille vers des touches de raisin blanc avec une pointe de poivré. Funk sur la fin, avec lusage de houblonnage à cru qui reste en retrait par rapport au brett dominant.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
1693,"2016-06-16",4.4,"330ml bottle. Pours clear gold with large bubbly white head. Aroma is vibrant brett. Taste is an initial brett hit with a welcome, very prominent Chardonnay influence. Wouldnt have guessed this as a hopfenweisse per se, perhaps a dry-hopped gose? Its certainly snappy, funky with a good balance of brett & chardonnay. This is a truly excellent beer.","Shrewsbury, Shropshire, ENGLAND","minutemat"

Anyway it poured a hazy golden amber with a thin white cap. Citrusy and yeasty nose, the taste similar: a bit of farmyard but no horse blanket, rural yet sophisticated.
