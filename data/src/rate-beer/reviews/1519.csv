Starts medium sweet with malts, wheat, orange and tropical fruit; ends slightly bitter and dry with hops and citrus.

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Great idea to match these two hops together with a wheat ale. Great soft flavours with loads of refreshing fruit, complimented by a fitting palate.
