1698,"2017-01-16",3.3,"Jeden z klasyków stylu, który w sumie należy do moich ulubionych, więc z zainteresowaniem po niego sięgnąłem. Piwo ma barwę słomkową, jest wyraźnie zmętnione, choć do pewnego stopnia przejrzyste, gdyby Weizen był bardziej mętny, to nie miałbym cienia pretensji. Piana ładna, obfita, biała, puszysta, po opadnięciu pozostawia kożuszek na powierzchni, ale nie lepi się do ścianek. W aromacie dominuje banan i to wcale nie jakiś bardzo wyrazisty. Szkoda, że zabrakło goździka, ale dla mnie najważniejsze, żeby ten był przede wszystkim w smaku. A w smaku... goździka nadal brak. Jeśli jest, to w ilości minimalnej gdzieś w dalekim tle. Więcej jest banana, jeszcze więcej wyraźnej kwaskowatości, niby rzecz typowa dla piw pszenicznych, a z drugiej strony ta kwaskowatość jest jakaś taka nieprzyjemna, kojarząca mi się z kiepskimi koncernowymi lagerami. W zasadzie brak jakiejkolwiek goryczki. Wysycenie jest wysokie, drobne, intensywnie musujące, co jak najbardziej typowe dla stylu. Piwo mimo wysokiego nagazowania, które teoretycznie powinno dodawać pełni, jest raczej wodniste i puste. Dla mnie Franziskaner to rozczarowanie.

Clove, ripe banana, pepper spices, malt and slight hops in the nose. Flavour is similar to the aroma with more sweet ripe banana, wheat and yeast which is balanced by some sourness and spices. Fine balance, perhaps a little bit too sweet. Good have been good with some more bitter hops, but nonethe less great taste profile.

Appearance typically perfect for a hefe. 
Taste is similar to aroma with smooth sweetness from the wheat and malt and gentle spice bitterness from the hops. Bit more sweet than necessary, could have a higher bitterness level and more prominent taste that is again similar to aroma. Pleasantly balanced.

Murky light brown, kind of unappealing looking beer with a huge, fluffy, white head and moderate carbonation.

The taste is much better though with awesome sweet banana and clove and hints of apples and pears, bready and creamy notes and even a hint of smoke.

1698,"2015-01-11",3.4,"Esta weissbier muestra un color anaranjado con tintes dorados siempre en un fondo turbio típico de la cerveza de trigo. Su espuma es blanca y consistente y le aporta gran cremosidad. Su aroma es robusto y característico, en el que se aprecian notas a plátano, nueces, flores, y especias. La entrada regala un cuerpo ligero y balanceado, con un paso medio que va en consonancia con su aroma, en el que saboreamos el trigo malteado, matices de limón y curaçao, caramelo, plátano y clavo, en un fondo a malta muy agradable. El final es semi-seco, producto de su elevada carbonatación, pero regala una sensación muy refrescante y completa que en ningún momento llega a empalagar. El recipiente más adecuado, y recomendado por cerveceo.com para saborear esta weissebier, es aflautado y alto, estrecho por la base y ancho por la parte superior. Además de esto, una temperatura de entre 5 y 7 grados, permite un mejor desarrollo de los aromas. Es muy importante servir correctamente esta cerveza, para conseguir su mejor estado; servimos lentamente con la copa inclinada 45º 2/3 partes de la cerveza, agitamos el resto que ha quedado en la botella y vaciamos el contenido con el vaso en posición vertical.

Very effervescent. The excess yeast filters to the bottom. Leave a little beer in the bottle to swirl around and finish the pour.

1698,"2014-05-23",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 3-21-12 - 
Poured from bottle into fluted glass

Appearance  Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with a very large billowy white head. The head has really good retention and lasts for some time before giving way to a moderate level of lacing.

Smell  The smell is very peppery in nature. A nice lemon aroma is also mixed in there with a good yeasty smell as well.

Taste  The taste begins with a nice wheaty base infused with some lighter citrus flavors. A good presence of yeast is also detected at the forefront of the taste. A peppery flavor develops more in the middle of the taste. It lasts throughout the rest of the taste profile and in the end mixes in with a more biscuit malt body leaving a nice somewhat spicy flavor on the tongue.

Mouthfeel  A medium bodied beer with a rather average level of carbonation. Makes for an easy drinking brew which is quite appropriate for the style.

Overall  A good brew that is easy to drink. It has some nice peppery flavors as well as some very nice aromas.","","Darkmagus82"

1698,"2013-03-18",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 25, 2013 July 2012 - Bottle.  Pretty good actually, spicy rich wheat beer, slight buttery/creamy-ness - more in the foretaste than the aftertaste.  Would certainly have again.  
Sep 2012 - Bottle.  Cold.  Banana smell.  Works well with the chocolate fudge I was eating at the time.  Very easy and really pleasant drinking.  I didnt get the same flavours as I did when it was warmer.  Slight tangerine citrusiness with a rounded finish.  
Nov 2012 - Room temp bottle.  OK.  Over carbonated, a bit spicy, lager notes, even a bit of rum.  Average.  Having enjoyed previous bottles, I wonder whether the quality is inconsistent.  Well find out, because I have another bottle lying around somewhere.
Dec 2013  - Room temp bottle.  Three tone yellow - orange - brown, small foamy white head.  Smell - banana esters, spice - clove, caramelised sugar/candyfloss, meaty in a way.  Body - medium, carbonation is medium to high.  Taste - initially watery, yeast, toned down lemon, stewed apples, builds to an estery aftertaste, slightly metallic finish.","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"

1698,"2013-03-13",3.7,"Reviewed 3/6/13. This was probably the first beer I bought that I truly loved, so Ive been meaning to revisit this one for a long time. 12 oz bottle into a weizen glass.

A: Pours a darker amber color that seems both less hazy and fizzier-looking than others in the style. The head is a beautiful five-finger pale cream color. It has one of the softest-looking textures Ive ever witnessed in ANY beer head, and retains itself reasonably.

S: This one is relatively clove-forward, with the general malts being the secondary aromatic feature. It seems like this one comes off drier than most.

T: Differing from the nose, the flavor itself is quite banana-forward to start. The banana esters will fade to a midtaste/finish of lactic cream, wheat, and cloves. No real depth here, just a solid no-frills hefeweizen.

M: I wondered if the feel would be dry due to the lack of a sweet nose - and I was wrong. This is a creamy, semi-sweet weizen, and pulls it off well. The thickness of the texture conceals the high carbonation somewhat, but as the carbonation fades, it seemingly becomes dry - very nearly to the point of being watery. On the plus side, it becomes more drinkable this way.

O: I dont know if this is quite the beer I fell in love with...ah well, its still good stuff. And its available practically everywhere to boot.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

1698,"2013-02-25",2.8,"Bottle.  Pours a cloudy yellow gold body with a rather small fizzy white head that faded to a thin covering.  The nose is pretty spot on for the style, very fruity with lots of banana and light spiciness with a hefty amount of yeastiness.  Doesnt get a whole lot better than this aroma, pretty nice considering its wide availability.  The flavor is a bit off kilter though.  Theres a lack of softness and smoothness here as well as a lack of the creamy mouthfeel that I want from the style.  Theres very little depth to this, theres a bit of spiciness throughout, but its a little aggressive and overpowers what should be the subtle beauty of the style.  Lighter bodied and more fizzy than what I prefer for the style as well.  I think this beer is either a shadow of its former self from when I started to get into better beer, or maybe its just very different from what is kegged.

Bottle at around 50F. Rolled to put yeast sediment in suspension.

Aroma:
Low banana and spicy aromas (esters/clove). Even at higher temperature and swirling in mouth. However low, very balanced.
Subble grainy, wheat aroma. Not powerful. No doughy aroma that youd get from a fresh version.

Appearance:
Great tall fluffy white head. Very creamy and lasting. 
Golden cloudy as this is the unfiltered version.

Flavor:
Subtle but balanced Banana and spicy flavor. Wheat, grainy, but not doughy from the yeast as youd see on a fresh version.
slight tartness from wheat, very welcoming.
Moderate hop bitterness balances the fruity esters of this beer. No hop flavors, such as floral, herbs, etc.

Mouthfeel:
Medium - med-low body. The sediment in suspension gives a front impression of fulness, but that is gone very fast. Creamy with a dry finish. Very carbonated. Spritzy.

Overall:
A good Heffe. Not as flavorful as the fresher ones, but that is expected from an imported bottle.

Es ist ein ordentliches Weizenbier mit gewisser Fruchtigkeit und Rezenz. Zum großen Wurf reicht es dennoch nicht. Dafür fehlt es an Spritzigkeit und ordentlicher Hefe-Würze a la Paulaner oder Schneider. Wahrlich kein schlechtes Hefeweizen, aber da fehlt das gewisse Extra: Ein Hauch Nelke, hefige Würzigkeit, sahnige Noten im Schaum etc. Als Paulaner-Bruder kann ich nur sagen:
""Ich möchte diesen Teppich nicht kaufen!"" - ""Is scho Recht!"" ;)

The aroma is of banana, clove, wheat, alcohol - what one would / should expect from the style, though not as mouth-wateringly tempting as I have enjoyed. The beer tastes very good, and is quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel is decent, but has room for improvement. The feel is similar to a soda in some regards - very fizzy and highly carbonated, making for a slightly harsh finish. There is a subtle note of alcohol in the finish. Overall, this is a good beer, and worth a try.

La schiuma è uno dei caratteri più belli di questa birra. Ad eccezione del colore, che risulta essere di un bianco sporco, si presenta particolarmente alta, compatta e pannosa, dalla scarsa persistenza.
Laroma fà perdere qualche punto, evidenziando come pecca una presenza scarna di odori allinterno del bouquet di aromi. Vi è un forte sentore di lievito, ed un lieve aroma fruttato di banana. Nel complesso un naso prettamente dolciastro, quasi burroso.
Il gusto è qualcosa di portentoso: pieno e rotondo, con un gusto dolce di lievito che colma il palato e delizia la bocca, accarezzando in maniera estremamente leggera. Limbocco dolciastro è appena appena smorzato da un leggero pizzicorio amarostico a livello palatale. Una nota di amaro agre (cedro?) in punta.

Pours a hazy brownish orange with a one finger head. Pretty poor head retention and lacing.

Smell is quite yeasty with loads of clove coming through along with a light musty odor. A small amount of bubblegum and orange too.

Appearance: Pours out a cloudy, golden-orange body with a rather large, fluffy, off-white head, though it quickly gasses out into just a very thin layering of fizzle.

Smell: Mild nose smelling of wheat malt, lemon wedges, ground coriander, and banana...the usual suspects.

Taste: Lightly tangy-tasting malted wheat. Small hint of raw grain. Light touches of lemon, coriander, and banana pass by the tongue. Hop bitterness remains very low, just enough to be felt. Things thin out considerably as you near the dry finish, but there is a bit more lemon to be had.

Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body, though lacking the creaminess of other weiss beers. In place of that a little more carbonation and tanginess.

So, this is one of the first ""special"" beers ive ever tasted back in the days. It has a very nice fruity, banana aroma with dry herbs and a fresh character. not that much variety in the aromascape, but what you can pick up is very clear and perfectly balanced. Very easy to drink. the body is medium with dry and full texture. the carbonation is very well balanced with the taste palate. The appearance is very nice with its golden and deep colour and refreshing look. i have to say that this is one of the best and most nostalgic wheat beers ive ever had. its a shame that the category is not my cup of tea with limited diversity, but considering what they wanted to create, this is very close to a perfectly balanced ""iconic"" wheat beer.","Greater London, ENGLAND","Chiswick"

Pours a very hazy apricot color with a super-fluffy white head that sticks around for quite a long time, leaving behind gobs of sticky lacing. The nose hits with some malty bread plus a bit of bubblegum and banana. Faint hint of cloves in the background. The flavor comes through with all the same notes. Not nearly as much clove as I would prefer, and the other yeast elements are a tad bit muted as well. Mouthfeel is light and moderately creamy.

It is complex enough to enthrall with every single sip- a sensation that lingers through each encounter. The hops must be of the noble variety, for it exudes delicate floral undertones. The malt hints at caramel and the aroma is exciting, enticing. I love to slip this beer into a long, original Franziskane glass, and sip it ever so slowly.

4.0 T: Again, pleasant banana esters and clove spiciness. Mellow wheat flavor. Again, good yeastiness. Well done again!

4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Lots of carbonation, which is correct to style. Light and bubbly. Very nice.

4.0 D: Ive been avoiding this beer for a long time since its pretty ubiquitous. I would rather try something a little more harder to find. I received this bottle as a Christmas gift and was glad that I did because Id love to have one of these from time to time.

1698,"2010-08-17",3.9,"12oz. bottle poured into a weizen glass. Incidentally the bottle is brown, not green. Im not sure when Franziskaner made this switch for their 12oz. bottles. Just an observation. No freshness info. Two inches of lumpy head forms and slowly dissipates. Color is a cloudy golden yellow with ample carbonation. The nose is classic banana-clove. I love the smell of a good Bavarian wheat beer. Well carbonated mouthfeel accentuates the lighter body of the beer. Definitely a good session beer. The sweet banana and coriander flavors on the palate are very mellow, not overpowering. This is a beer built to session. All the right attributes are there and are perfectly balanced. Paulaner is still a favorite of mine but I would choose a 12er of Franziskaner to bring to a party first.",", California, USA","hoppyhampy"

Appearance: Pours out a cloudy, golden-orange body with a rather large, fluffy, off-white head, though it quickly gasses out into just a very thin layering of fizzle.

Smell: Mild nose smelling of wheat malt, lemon wedges, ground coriander, and banana, with nothing previously listed being particularly aromatic.

Taste: Lightly tangy-tasting malted wheat with a thin measure of honeyish sweetness. Small hint of raw grain. Light touches of lemon, coriander, and banana pass by the tongue. Hop bitterness remains very low, just enough to be felt. Things thin out considerably as you near the dry finish, but there is a bit more lemon to be had.

Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body, though lacking the creaminess of other weiss beers. Medium carbonation.

1698,"2010-02-26",3.3,"I wouldnt say Im a huge fan of hefeweizens and wheat beers in general, although I have discovered some very tasty beers of the style over the last year or so. Franziskanker Hefe-Weissebier is one of the lesser-known names when it comes to authentic German wheat beers. Whats odd is the beer is the only one of its kind that comes packaged in green bottles, and we all know the perils of green bottles, right?I should disclaim this review by mentioning that the bottle I drank out of appeared to be old as a thick layer of yeast literally stuck to the bottom of bottle like pancake batter (despite the fact I gave the last 2 inches of liquid in the bottle a good swirl and shake before I poured them out). Still, I was quite surprised at just how well Franziskaner was able to perform given its inherent handicap.APPEARANCE AND AROMALike most hefeweizens, this beer pours to a very hazy body of dark amber/light brown. I actually saw some big chunks of yeast floating around the edges which eventually settled to the bottom. However, I didnt notice much carbonation. The head was surprisingly small at only two fingers tall and dissipated much faster than your average German hef.Since this beers bottle is green its not surprising there was a noticeable skunky scent to the aroma, but its not nearly as bad as the more notorious offenders (i.e. Heineken). If you take a deep whiff you can detect some spices and a faint sweet scent as well. I just wish they had been stronger.TASTESome people complain that hefeweizens, especially authentic German offerings, are too spicy, but beer geeks like me often find them to be complex and full of character. I think Franziskaner might work well as an introductory beer for those intimidated by the style since its actually rather mild. However, despite its low-key palate, it still manages to maintain the basic properties of a wheat beer of this type.I did detect a slight banana and clove taste, but only on the finish. The initial mouthfeel is watery and mild with a faint sweetness. Perhaps I detect coriander and/or orange peel or maybe a general mélange of spices. Whatever it may be its noticeable, but again, rather mild. Theres also a slightly skunky taste, but its tolerable and doesnt subtract from the overall palate.DRINKABILITYLightweights often pooh-pooh the spiciness of beers like this, but they never acknowledge just how easy these beers are to drink. Since Franziskaner Hefe-Weissebier is much milder than your average German brew of the type, its actually quite impressive how high it rates in terms of drinkability. The mouthfeel is extremely soft and yet a little thick so as not to be watery. Theres almost no noticeable carbonation, so it finishes extremely smooth and also makes it very refreshing. It was difficult for me not to chug this beer!WEIGHTNeither the bottle nor the brewers website indicates any statistics about this brew, but third-party sources say Franziskaner Hefe-Weissebier has a potency of only 5% ABV. I would certainly believe that since the mild body goes perfectly with a weight of this sort. In fact, I wouldnt be surprised if the actual numbers were lower since this beer drinks like an American macro light as it does not come close to overwhelming or filling up the drinker. FINAL THOUGHTSI always try to give the benefit of the doubt, so I believe its very possible Franziskaner Hefe-Weissebier is actually much closer to being a top-notch brew than it appeared to be. Since my bottle was old I know I didnt get an accurate reflection of how this beer should really taste. But considering all it had going against it, Id say its still a good beer since its tasty, smooth and light.

The aroma is reminiscent of bread dough with some bubble gum, some banana, some lemon and some light floral notes. Every time I taste this it takes me back to my early days of beer drinking, this was at one time what I considered to be my favorite beer one taste shows me that I was without a doubt on to something. The flavor of the beer is complex but at the same time ""drinkable"" enough to sit and sip without pouring over every nuance, it is at once a beer both to be savored and sessioned sometimes at the same time but without guilt this can also be done very separately.  The first thing that hits you is the banana and spicy clove, although hallmarks of the style they seem to come forth in this beer in a way that makes it one of the necessary beers to try within the style. Going beyond that there is a lemon like citrus character and a fruitiness including apple and pear that tricks one into thinking they are drinking a far sweeter beer, this beer is by no means bone dry but the fruitiness lends the beer both an approachable quality for beginners and a nuance for connoisseurs that make this all around a pretty nice go to beer.

Very bubbly, somewhat dark, cloudy orange-yellow with a huge fluffy head. American-made Hefeweizens wish they could look like this. Wait a minute, where did the head go? - it settled down to a thin layer with no lacing. Oh well, nice while it lasted.

Aroma of spicy clove, wheat malt, banana, lemon and light noble hops.

Major clove and wheat taste, while the banana is a little more restrained. While very good, not quite as flavorful as hoped for. A big chunk of yeast settled on the bottom (despite my best efforts to break it up), and when I took that last sip, it tasted much more flavorful. While this bottle only arrived at my store a couple weeks ago, I can only assume this would have been better if it was fresh in Germany and the yeast had been mixed up better.

High carbonation, light body, dry finish.

Taste is dominated by sweet banana, very typical for a Bavarian hefe. A healthy citrus note prevents this brew from being cloying. Spicy, dry finish and herbal after taste. 

One of the signature mainstream hefe beers from ""down under"": very well balanced, at once, supremely quaffable and quite characterful.

What more can you ask.  Starting out with smooth buaetiful head, pearly in color, almost like the puff of a cloud.  The first taste is almost legendary to its nature.  Light but flavorful, weizen at its best. And who new, the suprise of banana with no part,  Almost as it fell of the tree of a fransiskaner bloom. Smooth, like a babys bottom.","Oatmeal Stout, New York, USA","jmmino08"
1698,"2009-08-06",3.1,"Memories there is nothing quite like the Franziskaner Hefeweizen to take me down memory lane. While it may not be gilded in gold or over the rainbow, I have many a fond memory of this beer, and thankfully, the memories always hold up to the impartial blatancy of reality. The Franziskaner Hefeweizen was my first hefeweizen, and to this day it is still one of my favorite. I know I can always sit down with a hefeweizen glass filled to the brim with Franziskaner, and life is good.


Hazy oranges mingle with soft golden straw colors resting easy under a gentle white head that is easily 2-3 fingers thick, as she should be. In absolutely no rush, she fades at her own pace, leaving clumps of lace and a rocky blanket of white foam behind. Her nose is a beautiful bouquet of spice, bananas, banana bread, clove, and bubblegum. The spice hits first followed by soothing notes of orange and clove. Orange zest nips at the back and soft wheat holds it all gently in her embrace. Taking a moment to bask in her presence, I finally surrender to the growing thirst which must be satiated. Soft, lightly chewy, with a coating palate of bananas, moist banana bread, and orange esters. Cloves, spice, and more bananas linger in my breath as her softness lulls me into fond memories of past times spent together. Like a good friend, after the first sip of my Franziskaner Hefeweizen, it is as if no time at all has passed. Light and highly aromatic, her body prefers a more subtle approach. A bit more orange comes into play, mingling with banana while wheat provides a soft bed upon which her palate unravels. Hefeweizens will always be my favorite summer thirst quencher, followed very quickly with Belgian Witbiers. While not the best, Franziskaner Hefeweizen will always hold a soft spot in my heart.


Franziskaner also offers a Dunkel Hefeweizen which is equally as nostalgic and thirst-quenching as her standard brother, the Hefeweizen. Many who taste a hefeweizen for the first time after being misled by American wheat beers who claim falsely to be hefeweizens, are shocked, surprised, and quite often put-off by its aromatic nature. Cloves, spice, banana, and breads are the spice of life when it comes to German hefeweizens, and I wouldnt have it any other way. Grab a sixer of Franziskaner Hefeweizen and create your own treasured memories.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"
1698,"2009-08-06",3.1,"Pint on tap. Looks like a typical hefe, cloudy with tight white head that fades but doesnt disappear. Aroma of banana, but very weak compared to most of the hefes Ive had.

1698,"2009-06-23",3.3,"Pours a super turbid neon yellow with a quickly dissipating white head. Complex aroma of banana and cloves that is rarely matched in any Hefe outside of Germany (this is somewhat masked by an issue detailed below). Taste is restrained banana/fruity character with spicy clove. The major problem I have always had with this beer is that it is way over carbonated. The stinging carbonation scrubs away most of the flavor. If I want to taste some of the complex tastes in there, I have to spend ten minutes forcing carbonation out of the beer by swishing it around. The high level of carbonation also makes it really difficult to get a good whiff of the aroma because the nucleating bubbles carry away all of the smells. So, it is not until you work out the carbonation that you can truly partake. Other than that, it is one of the poster children of the style and deserves a chance from anyone looking for a good Hefe.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Avengedpoet"

1698,"2008-08-21",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2012 Heres another jolly monk beer, and inside, a delicious German beer and the perfect example of the simple satisfaction that comes from a Hefe-Weizen.  This dark golden beer emits a fluffy banana smell, accompanied by well fitted oat aroma and the general scent of banana bread baking in the oven.  The aftertaste is heavy in weight, but faint in flavor, making it the ideal way to conclude a sip - the beer leaving the mouth like a diver off the diving board, leaving a wobble when its gone.  The taste repeats the ode to banana and oats (a classic breakfast mix) on a very soft and fluffy palate.  Its a pleasant, tasty, light beer, which has the odd effect if being both filling and refreshing.  It nourishes both body and soul, as I find myself slowly nodding and smiling at the simple elegance of this style. 3.7

Re-rate and tasting notes from May 30th, 2011
Puffy white head, tickles the moustache, luminescent orange body glowing with a deep hearty orange and yellow on the edges. Smell has light coriander notes and wheat, a little banana and a touch of clove. Flavor starts fuzzy, lots of soft carbonation that smoothly delivers more of the banana, clove, and wheatiness in the aftertaste.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
1698,"2008-08-21",2.9,"essa é uma típica Weissbier alemã, o que se nota logo de cara na aparência pomposa de sua espuma inicial, que, além de enorme, é extremamente borbulhante. A cor da espuma é branca, enquanto que a do corpo é âmbar-claro. Há boa formação de colarinho, com longevidade duradoura e corpo também borbulhante. Há grande presença de sedimentos de tamanho razoavelmente grande, a densidade do corpo é grossa (4/5). No aroma também não se nota nada de muito novo: notas cítricas de limão, presença moderada de levedo e os já tradicionais banana e cravo (7/10). O sabor inicial é levemente doce e ácido (a leveza é semelhante a de um refrigerante), mesma descrição do final, este de curta duração (5/10). O paladar é composto de corpo médio-leve, textura aguada, carbonatação bem gasosa (semelhante a de um refrigerante) e final ligeiramente metálico. Está presente um gosto lupulado e condimentado, com notas de canela (2/5).","União da Vitória, BRAZIL","danielyabu"

Lots of banana on the nose.  The brew is semi-dry, with banana notes (maybe mingling with some lemon).  High carbonation levels, per the style, show next, beginning mid-palate... accompanying this begins the wheat contingency and a tad of orange.  This eventually leads to a dry spicy finish, closing with slight clove and yeast/wheat notes.  Nothing is overt or overdone, and the mouthfeel is a bit seltzer-like.  German hefe’s tend to have large carbonation levels, but I’m really missing some substance in the middle of the pull.  Better than its dunkel counterpart, it’s a decent summer brew.

6. If I was stuck on an island with only one beer, it would be this one.  I would gladly drink myself to death with this beer!  And, since it has yeast in suspension it would easily keep me healthy for 200 years.  Minimum.  Dont underestimate the bower of B12!
7. The taste is really smooth - not bitter or malty.  Just smooth.  Typically smoothness in a beer comes from vanilla or oak.  Not for this beer!  :)
8. Delicious is the understatement of the year for this beer!

The aroma is at first grain and herbal hops rather more like a German pilsner-which is good to me-but thenthe classic German hefeweizen qualities take over, with banana, bubblegum, marshmallow, wheat, yet always with a grainy-hoppy, alcoholic lager quality mixed in, as well as an odd musty quality which slightly detracts.  In taste, it is great, with lots of fruit, some bubblegum, good sweet-bitter presence and balance, a long, slightly alcoholic grain-banana finish.  Its not to soft, a complaint I ote have with wheat beers of various types.

And oh so refreshing. Even on a cool March evening it still manages to refresh. Some sweet malts and just a kiss of citrus. Bananas is the main attraction on the aroma though.

The first sip is just a bit of a letdown, as the citrus notes are slightly watered down and not as crisp as they showed in the nose.  Creamy banana and spices are again a bit subdued.  A lighter than medium palate is well carbonated and not at all sticky or cloying, lending to its supreme drinkability.  Short, clean finish.  This is nothing special, but it owns Tucher and Julius-Echter in the widely-available Hefe category.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

There was a bit of sediment in the bottom of the bottle, and I rolled the beer around a bit to get some of it up before opening and pouring. 

It was very cloudy and had a beautiful yellow-orange glow. The scent was appealing, wheaty and fruity. It tasted primarily of hops and banana. This went down smooth and was a bit creamy.

I will undoubtedly drink this many times again.","Youngstown, Ohio, USA","donteatpoop"

Fresh banana, citrus smell with a woody feel.
Refreshing watery, sour flavour - well balanced.
The first taste is quite intense banana which then drifts into hints of cherries, lemon and a saturated background: un unclear palate which I cant place but which seems to accentuate the banana-lemon combination very nicely. Bit too dry for a weissbier, though.
Very interesting beer - it promises to be a good German weissbier and turns out to be that and something more. Unexpected.","NETHERLANDS","Bosskie"

Bottle 500 ml, brown. 
Body is hazy with quite a huge white head. 
Aroma of strong yeast, not ripe apple and banana. Franziskaner unfortunately has no full rounded taste. Its too accidic and metalic for me and the body is definitely too thin as for a ""premium"" german hefeweizen.
Aftertaste gives some notes of citrus accidity and quite noticeable wheat grains. Again more like soft refreshing hefe which lacks a bit more yeasty flavour and thickness of the body. Looks much worse for me when compared to Paulaner Hefeweizen, not only in terms of taste but also in terms of body appearance, I think because of lower yeast ingredient.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

A very good looking beer, but use a hefe glass to get the full effect.  Initial aroma of banana, giving way to some fruity malt. Flavor is fruity malt, with a hint of citrus.

I just love the look of this beer too, with its crisp white head that froths nicely and diminishes evenly. Its murky tan/orange is a great sign posting of what your about to drink. Zesty orange, apple cider, wine, bock, bread and beer. There is no down side to this Hefeweizen. Even the finish is tangy and sweet and leaves your yearning for another gulp. Franziskaner monks didnt start out celibate, but if you had to chose between this beer and women......... tough one.

1698,"2007-10-20",3.7,"Pours dark yellow/light orange, if you reserve the bottom inch of beer at the bottom of the bottle, and shake it around real good, it will break up the sediment at the bottom and make a nice cloudy brew.  The way I like it.  This has the best aromas of the German Hefes Ive been drinking.  It is very banana and wheat, sweet, like dessert.  The tast is not as strong as the others, but it has a nice sweet finish to it that lingers.  This is not a gulping beer, this is a sipping beer.  If I want a little more zing to a hefe, Ill go for a Schneider.  But really, all in all, I have about 5 types of hefes in my refrigerator, and I always run out of the Franziskaners first.

The flavor is not as bold as Id like, but this isnt the most robust of styles. Even at that, this one is a tad watery.  Subtlety is displayed in the workings of the apple, wheat, bubblegum, and clove aspects. The finish is medium dry.

Some banana and clove perhaps.  The spices and floral fragrances remain when drinking. Blend is not perfect, balance on the palate is a bit too light and washy with the mouthfeel.

1698,"2007-05-10",4.3,"Rated 1/13/06:  I was beginning to think that hefes were not for me, the previous few that I have had just didnt do it for me. This one takes the cake so far. A beautiful deep yellow/orange color filled my glass with a constant head and adequate lacing. The carbonation is like the other hefes in that it is strong and constant. What stands out about the franziskaner is the aroma and flavor. My previous hefes were too sweet smelling and the banana taste was overpowering. This one melds a whole lot of spices and citrus flavors and rolls them into a well crafted wheat beer. I cant say enough about the taste with this one very smooth and extemely refreshing, Im glad I never gave up on hefe-weissbiers.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"

Rather creamy, nicely balanced.  This is perfectly mouthfilling in texture.  Creamy without an abundance of carbonation.  Perfectly appropriate for a session style.  The flavors are in line with the aroma, though perhaps more captivating.  An apple cider acidity balances an banana sweetness.  Slightly spicy lemon tartness, with some cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.

The aroma is of wheat, with something of the malt. It spills a color lightly cloudily palely brown, almost a bronze. It is really thick, with a smooth and colored head (with a lot of duration). The flavor is to fruits. The hop is very subtle, you upset perceptibly. (The hop is in the depth, to support for a long time, the aroma and the flavor).

The funny thing about this beer is that when I bought it as the bottled picture it tasted nasty, but when I bought it in the six pack it was pretty good. I wish there was a bigger Hefeweizen following. This beer was decent. I am starting to enjoy Imperial Stouts more and more. The flavor was okay, Hefeweizens are becoming too carbonated and too thin for my taste, but for Hefes this has a thick taste to it. It had the taste of fruit, I would lean closer to lemons, or a sour orange if I had to choose a citrus flavor. Decent pour, the head settles quicker than other Hefes.

But, I dont know if this has as much to do with it being a great beer, rather more to do with the fact that it is easy drinking and smooth.  The truth be told, this beer, like most Hefeweizen, is completely one-dimenional in taste: on the palate it is smooth and refreshing, and the finish is very easy to enjoy. But great-tasting or original, not a chance.  The best compliment I can give this beer is that it is great during Oktoberfest when consumption is the name of the game, and drinking yourself silly is what everyone is doing.  However, if I am sitting down to have a nice beer in the evening this one would leave me wanting something more.  Anyway, enough rambling.  Enjoy, cheers.","Whitmore Lake, Michigan, USA","Dezzilu"

This has a cloudy gold color with jumpin jack flash style carbonation seen in the bubbles that continuously rise to the surface.  Of course, this keeps a nice, white fizzy head on the surface at all times.  Initially, the aromaa reminded of a pilsener, but after it warmed up a bit, I noticed corn, ripe bananas, and butterscotch.  It is a milder than the pungent American hefes that tastes like fermented corn silage on the farm to me.

1698,"2006-01-25",4.6,"Of all the German and domestic hefeweizens on the market today, Franziskaner Hefe-Weiss Bier is one of my all time favorites. This beer is very accessible, and is one of the best examples of this classic German style. Franziskaner Hefe-Weiss Bier pours to a bright, opaque golden color with a huge, dense, rocky, white head, and a very lively carbonation. Remember, you want to swirl the yeast sediment into the beer, so it is going to be cloudy. The nose on this beer is fantastic. Fruity, estery aromas of clove, banana, and bubble gum flood the nose. The palate is tart and refreshing. Flavors of wheat malt, pear, and more slight banana flavors coat the tongue. The body is round and smooth, and so drinkable. Franziskaner Hefe-Weiss Bier finishes with a nice balance of malt flavor, a touch more clove and banana, and just enough hop presence to balance. 

This really is a wonderful beer, and the perfect summer refresher. Hefeweizen in Germany is often consumed in mid-morning with weisswurst sausages, making it, believe it or not, a breakfast beer! I would not at all be against the idea, in fact, I have enjoyed a hefeweizen with breakfast on more than one occasion. I enjoy making a drink called a ""hefemosia"" which consists of equal parts hefeweizen and orange juice, that is very refreshing and delicious. That being said, I really believe this beer is more suited for lunch or dinner. It works really well with German fare, such as bratwurst and saurkraut, and would work well with roasted pork or chicken as well. I however, enjoy this beer most after a long hot day, as a thrist quencher.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

I think the banana flavor comes through, but theres just something about this brew that makes it consistently excellent everytime I try it. When I am confused about what I should buy,  I always seem to be able to fall back on this. Its not always cheap though. Its often around 7.99 USD per six pack, which isnt horrible, but not exactly a bargain price either.  Once I had to have an opportunity to get it on draft, and it was incredible. It was a wedding reception with a free bar, so I kept coming back for more and more and more till I was hammered, and it kept tasting great, but the point is, this is what I kept coming back for, and didnt want anything else once I had figured out that this was the ultimate, that is, when it was draft.","Illinois, USA","soulrefugee"

1698,"2006-01-18",3.0,"Id say refreshing was about the only fitting description I could think of after tasting this World famous Hefeweiss. I didnt have a bad sample as it was clean as a whistle so I am assuming my taste-buds were asleep for the afternoon. Poured a very lively, hazy pastel orange with an enormous rocky white head that rose a  good inch from the glass. Head would not budge for the length (making tasting difficult, so off it went) and it left globs of foam daubed all over the sides. It certainly looked good! Nice deep toasted malt and gritty wheat grain nose with underpinned notes of banana, strawberry, bubblegum and what seemed like burnt wood. So far so good. Quite tangy in the mouth in the first sip. Spritzy in carbonation and medium-light, light bodied. Pleasant yet overly subtle mix of soft fruits like cantaloupe, and honeydew before tangy citric fruits take-over in the back. Light grainy note balances out the subtle flavours with an ever growing note of cloves that became over-powering by the end as it lingered solo in the mouth. Its otherwise undemanding as it had the mouthfeel of a watered down lager. Good to look at and pleasant to the nose, but a little bland in the mouth to save itself. One for the re-rate bin!

1698,"2005-09-12",3.1,"(500 ml bottle: $1.99 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) This is most certainly a gorgeous beer.  Pours a bright orange-golden body thats fully cloudy, but I can still see quite a legion of carbonation bubbles rising quickly through the beer.  The tall white head settles to and maintains a quarter-inch crown atop the beer for the entire session, leaving some patchy lacing.  The nose is only mildly aromatic and is nicely balanced with wheat and banana, but theres also some plastic table cloth going on there too.  A balance of wheat malt and subtle banana in the flavor, but the finish seems a bit stale to me.  Light-medium body tends to trail off toward wateriness in the finish.  Contrary to what the visuals might indicate, the carbonation level is pretty light on the palate.  You know, I seem to remember this tasting better years ago, and looking back at past notes, the quality seems to have dropped off now that its part of the massive conglomerate.

Average lasting, big and white head ( on the weak side considering it´s a Hefe). Yeasty appareance ( though not so cloudy) maybe  a little too ""white"", even for a wheat beer. Somewhat citrusy aroma. Flavor is slightly acidic, tart and citric.  Flavor may have affected because of the green bottle and the beer being not so fresh ( Germany is really far from here and i think it was imported pretty long ago, maybe for an Octoberfest promotion or something like that).

Pronounced lemon-yeast aroma, with a hint of something warm -- maybe clove?  Taste was really delightful -- mild, citrus with a touch of yeasty banana, and a lingering spicey, almost peppery clove-like aftertaste. Not as heavy as Paulaner or Weihenstephaner -- milder, less forward, and a bit less hops bitterness.

1698,"2004-06-17",2.7,"Bottle into Weizen glass.  Im not inclined to get weis beers, but it was this or Miller Lite, so I thought Id try it out.  Overall, I would say that it was inoffensive, but unimpressive.  Even though I dont usually like weis beers, I like them to try to be the best beers they can.  This one was weak and watered down it seemed to me.  The aroma was the best part, citrusy with some harsh hoppy biting accent.  Orange and hazy in the glass, it had a sizeable white head with ok lacing.  Initally, you taste the acidity but its not that smooth.  Then, feeble and underdeveloped orange and lime flavors emerge and disappear quickly to be replaced by the wheaty aftertaste that wasnt that strong.  Still, better than Miller Lite.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

1698,"2003-11-06",3.5,"I think I was a little surprised at first at how highly this was rated, because the subtlety is strongly suppressed at even a bit colder than ideal.  Big, white head, more regular and slightly larger bubbles than the Club-Weisse, dark yellow/brown/amber, mildly hazy (not deeply so).  Quite light aroma relative to the flavors, with yeast and wheat being strong.  The flavors are nice when it is warm enough, spicy and fruity, bananas, light pepper touch, gentle clove, perhaps a bit of bubblegum.  Like the Club-Weisse, also, the palate improves as it warms, from the initial watery bleakness to a soft, fluffy carbonation with enough citrus sensibilities to think someone chucked in some lemon zest.  Still, a bit flat, but the flavors are good.

Aroma is big on bubblegum and cloves, no bananas to my nose this time around.  Sweet flavour with bubblegum and heavy creamy quickly picks up spicy clove and pepper notes closing with a semi-dry, tart and wheaten finish.  Medium bodied with a velvety texture and bustling carbonation.  Flavour would be better if it were more banana than bubblegum, but oh well.Old score: 7,4,6,3,13 = 3.3  500 mL bottle, served in a hefe glass.  Frothy white head diminishes slowly.  Body is a hazy peach color with no visible particles.  Banana and clove overtones; perhaps a hint of bubblegum.  Grainy malt, flowery hops, doughy yeast.  Sweet start is pushed back by a slightly acidic and bitter finish that is somewhat short.  Medium body has a watery texture.  Significant carbonation consists of many small bubbles.

In the appropriate glass, it also offers a large, bright white, effervescent head that left a trace of lacing.  I give this medium-bodied beer extra points for the ritualistic pouring instructions that extract all the important constituent parts of this brew, including the pleasantly yeasty, spicy hops and citrus-like aroma.  The carbonation level is just right--crisp and refreshing as are the mid-palate flavors of grapefruit, lemon, clove and cardamom.  The finish is strong and, again, pleasingly refreshing.

I enjoyed this while watching the locals drink and relax on a Friday afternoon.  Wonderful Hefeweizen appearance, yellow-orange and hazy with a bright white head.  Aroma of wheat, fruit, citrus, sweet malts and spicy hops.  Flavor of golden roasted grains, lemon, cardamom, cumin, and pepper with a sweet-n-sour finish.  Nice medium body but the carbonation was a little aggressive.  Overall a good beer and nice drinking experience!","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"

1698,"2003-05-29",3.3,"Hazy, cloudy, gold colored body w/ a nice frothy white head; typical of hefe style.  Cloves and wheat malt very apparent, slightly yeasty, but banana/vanilla/bubble gum aromas are missing;  however, cardboardy(oxidized) aromas are more apparent than the standard aromas.  That's too bad!  Wheat malt and clove flavors present, but so are oxidized/cardboard flavors.  Neither hop nor malt flavor are truly dominant and aftertaste is of wheat malt and cardboard/papery.  Very high carbonation, expectant of style, but it's missing the creaminess and smoothness of hefe style.  Very dissappointing, although I know this is normally a very, very good beer.  I'll rate higher based on past experience, but I'm not quite sure who to blame for this bad example.  Whether it's the distributor or the store, it doesn't really matter.  This is just a travesty to this particular beer to be treated so poorly.  I will re rate this at a later date and the score will be higher!","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

The flavor was unique. This is my first German wheat hefe, so the lack of citrus taste that is present in Widmer hefe caught me off guard but the smooth banana clove flavors took me to a good place. I drank almost the whole bottle just by doing the review! A nice wheat finish and true to the style. Well done!

The aroma has a wonderful blend of fruits, spices, yeast, and bananas while the taste is pretty much exactly what a hefe should be.  Fruit, cloves, and vanilla all dominate the tasting and blend together perfectly.  A truly wonderful hefe.Im usually a huge fan of hefeweizens, but this one seemed a bit bland.  The color is the usual hazy yellow with a medium sized head.  The aroma is slightly fruity and the taste as well, but overall, it seemed weak with a taste that left something to be desired.
