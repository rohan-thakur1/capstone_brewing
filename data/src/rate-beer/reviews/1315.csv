1315,"2014-04-25",3.7,"hazy orange honey, wispy white head laces the glass. Toasty nose is light butterscotch, sawdust, wet bark. Caramel and toast front palate becomes bitter, woody mid with alcohol-balanced sugar in the light orange, light gum ester finish. Pleasant, balanced, very expressive for a style, warmth brings too much butterscotch for my preference.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

1315,"2013-10-23",4.0,"On tap at hotd. Colour...deep amber with a moderately thick head. Nose...boy-howdy! Thats a malty one! With treacle and toffee to boot! Palate...delicate CO2, with loads of dark toffee, caramel, dark fruits and malt, malt, malt! Theres raisin here and dates too and a candy like aspect that does not overwhelm nor disappoint!

1315,"2012-12-03",3.7,"Seems I never entered this on 07-06-12. Reviewed from notes.

On tap at the tasting room. 12oz glass.

A: Thick, opaque brown. Leaves some thin lacing.

N: Light malt in the nose. Pine and floral elements. Not particularly strong or inviting; just there.

T: Very aggressive bitterness sliding into leather and smoke with a backend of sweetness. Pine, bakers chocolate. If no one told me, I might think its Adam. Appropriate level of alcohol for 8%. Does get a little sweeter as it warms.

M: Medium mouthfeel. Prickly.

O: A pretty decent Scotch ale, but I was expecting something else. Feels too bitter.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
1315,"2012-12-01",3.6,"On tap at the brewpub in Portland, OR. Pours a cloudy, deep brown-amber colored body with a finger-width, creamy, tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is lightly sweetened caramels with hints of toast and some cherries, earth, and touches of smoke. A light chocolate note in there as well. Flavor is similar. Smooth and malty with a nice caramel, toast, and light chocolate balanced by some earth, light smoke notes, and touches of cherry. Finishes clean, smooth, and mostly dry with a very light, earthy and smokey bitterness. Lengthy aftertaste following a medium-full, smooth body and a soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty solid Sottish Ale. Smooth and malty with some chocolate notes and a light, earthy smoke to balance. Nice beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
