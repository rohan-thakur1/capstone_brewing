3514,"2016-06-28",3.8,"Draught at the fermentorium, 6/11/16.Deep honey golden body is quite bright with good clarity and a small but well-retained white head atop.Fruity yeast notes mix with light white bread, honey and vanilla, showing good balance and overall soft, mild aromatics that tickle the nose. Some moderate minerality and light plaster add charm, as well, and theres a touch of herbal/peppery hop notes mixed in, for good measure. No alcohol or flaw.Soft, plush malts provide huge amounts of honey and vanilla. Some caramel malt graininess/toastiness is evident on the finish, but it works to balance the sweeter maris otter notes. Mineral water and light yellow and red fruit esters seem very appropriate as gentle, but pleasing hop bitterness adds crispness to the finish. Very drinkable and flavorful with charming yet clean yeast and water notes. Low but mostly tight carbonation.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3514,"2016-06-13",3.4,"On draft at Tired Hands Fermentaria. The pour is a amber tinted good color with a thin film of white head that leaves a pretty good amount of lace as it falls. The aroma is strange. There is a strong strange maltiness. The raisins are present for sure, and the breadiness is something that does help deter from the strangely sweet malt. There is a little dirty earthiness on the way back. Im not a fan of this aroma at all. The flavor is really sweet and messy. Its bright and sweet. There is a strong breadiness that controls most of it. There is a bitterness that I believe is tied to the hop, but its like its a muddy hop. There is a strong dirt addition to it. The mouth feel is pretty good for a mild. Its a little heavy, but nicely carbonated. The aftertaste falls off quick, and its dirty hop and a hint of malt. This one is really strange, and this seems to be a theme here.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Appearance is dark golden, white head, somewhat hazy. Taste is robust malt, raisins, dry, bitter, some sweetness. Mouthfeel is light to medium body, light carbonation, dry, weird roasted aftertaste.
