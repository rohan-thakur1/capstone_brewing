But noble hop is tasted immediately. Dry, earthy, sulfury, and spicy. That was the first sip. The second was full of citrus and tropical fruit indicating a good blast of West Coast hops as well as the Noble. A little lemon, too.

Ive been hearing all the buzz about Heater Allen and have yet to have had the chance to try any of their beers. So here we go...

Pours a dark rich maize with a fluffy off-white head. Glowing bubbles rise in streams from the bottom of the stylish Pilsner glass that I never use because it has to be hand washed. (Heater Allen deserved the special treatment). This is a good looking beer. And the aroma is wonderful as well. Grassy hops, just like a pils should feature, a bit of pepper and a little bit more malt drive than you might expect. The flavor is really full -- bready malts atop a substantial blast of bitter European hops. Its a lovely beer, and very enjoyable to drink. Im not sure its the perfect pils; I like them a bit crisper and more thirst quenching, with lower malt content and a snapper hop presence. But thats a minor complaint. Ill be very pleased to try anything else that Heather Allen puts out.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

This is elegant and graceful, as pilsner go, with no rough edges and a lot of keeping within the lines.

This is probably my 4th experience with this beer over many years, and I never rate because I keep expecting it to be better. But this is my first draft sample at a brand new bar in the Paramount hotel, so its about as fresh as Im ever likely to get it. Its mos def nice, and clean, but it never really excites me enough to get into the high 3 / low 4 range. Bitterness level is a little too high for the small amount of remaining malt sugars, but thats a lot better than being too sweet.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2803,"2014-06-05",4.2,"Pours a stately banana yellow. Soft and yellow like a lemon. Very hazy with a fat creamy head of foam that left rings of lace. Just gorgeous . The head never ended on this. I am all the way down into the bottom of the glass and there is still a layer on tip.

Nose is sensual with a bit of malt presence that is a surprise. This pils malt had a bit of depth that was round and fat but not like honey. Just a bit more prominent than usual and i loved it. It had a lovely herbal, sweet grass and a faint bit of lemon grass. Spice and the grainy sweetness you come to expect from a pils. 

Taste is outstanding. Refreshing crisp dry and everything I said about the nose. I am convinced that when the taste of a beer matches the nose you have a brilliant lager. Ticklish carbonation and a bit of spice. beautiful with sweet grass a bit of spice and an earthy lemon to finish this one dry and satisfying.

2803,"2013-09-01",3.0,"22-Aug-13 (22-oz bottle: Thursday Night Bottle Share, shared by Eric)This beer pours a hazy yellow-gold bogy with half an inch of white head that settles to a ring. The nose is grassy hops and grainy malt with a touch of malt husk. Its similar on the palate, showing medium-bitter hops with a grassy, almost weedy flavor and a very grainy, slightly sweet malt, but theres a perception of huskiness thats most noticeable in the evolution and finish. The bitterness lingers for a long finish too, leaving a final impression centered around the hops. Its light in body and medium in carbonation with a dry mouthfeel. Overall, this Pilsener is just too hoppy and bitter; it overwhelms the malt base. Although a good amount of hop flavor would be fine for an American-style Pilsener, its the hop bitterness that is over done.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Pours slightly cloudy pale yellow with a thick copious head. I may have been a bit rough with the bottle. Aroma is light pale malt and crisp slightly spicy hops. Taste is clean light malt with super flavorful finish - thinly but sharp spiced hops with a peppery finish. Not really malt-driven but way maltier than most lagers.

Aroma briefly of sulphur, then toast, and whatever that ""pilsner"" smell is that I cant articulate after drinking ales almost exclusively my entire beer-drinking life. Taste is toasted grains, a little spiciness, with a short clean bitter bite at the finish. Some sips feel like white wine + hops. Light to medium body, lively carbonation, very crisp, easy drinking. Overall: perfect day for this pilsner, and a reminder that I should really stop being so ale-focused and consider drinking more seasonally. This is a delight.

2803,"2012-11-03",4.4,"My Bottom Line:
Pillowy pils malts suggest straw, while spicy hops bloom and dally about in this most authentic and endearing Světlý Leák.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the misty blond.
-Hops are well leveled throughout, developing a pleasant bitterness in the finish.
-Mouthfeel is neither dry nor sweet. It dwells in that perfect middle ground
-I wonder if they do open fermentation? In any case, their flavors seem to ""breathe"" like many beers from Czech brewpubs who do open fermentation.
-One of North Americas rare Czech-style Pilseners which is as impressive as Czechias best examples. Wow.

2803,"2011-12-12",4.3,"Bottle - Pours clear light yellow with cascading bubbles that rise up to a foamy white head. Awesome lacing--something that I rarely comment about. Definitely malt-forward smell--bready and a touch doughy, with a toasted component and butter hints. Nice herbal/floral hop component that balances everything out well. A little lemongrass, and a little astringency--but it all comes together nicely. Mostly soft and very complex. Taste approximates the nose, with light, bready malt, lightly toasted and nice and full. The hops are more assertive here, with the herbal notes amped up and on the verge of being too sharp, but they thankfully fade out slowly after cresting, finishing with one last malty burst. Well-carbonated and surprisingly full-bodied, this one coats the mouth with flavor without ever being too heavy. Overall Id like a little less malt to make this a little more crisp and refreshing, but its hard to argue that the full-flavor and complexity is something to dock points for.

2803,"2011-08-16",4.3,"Draft (multiple pours at Hair of the Dog and Belmont Station): Shimmering chartreuse. Persistent clingy white foam. Invigorating notes of minerals leap from the glass, along with polished wafts of lemon zest, thyme, buttercup, fennel seed, and spruce tips. Exceptionally clean pils malt aromatics of new-mown hay and and lightly toasted bread. Snug carbonation. Firm bodied. Natural carbonation. Remarkably immaculate snap of minerals and fresh baguette maltiness leads the way, dovetailing with an elegant mixture of herbaceous hops coupled with an appetizing lemon zest bitterness. Nuanced yet sublimely complex hop profile teems with luster and flavor (lilac, honeysuckle) which echoes that of the bitterness with  an immensely explosive lemony juiciness, pulp and all. Minerals scour the palate while the hops distribute their flavorsome nectars to counterbalance. Yeast appropriately supplies trace astringency yet never interferes with the array of delicacies. Finishes succulent and juicy with continued hoppy brightness and crackery, gently toasty haylike malt punctuated with a lengthy herbal afterimage of aniseed and lemon verbena. Floral notes exude with each belch. Comes off as more of a German pils than Czech, but a downright masterful rendition, regardless.  A ""road-trip-worthy"" caliber of lager obviously brewed with thorough attention to detail.  Absolutely world-class stuff from true artisans of the beer world.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2803,"2011-08-05",4.5,"22oz bottle, no bottled on or best by date. Also, for some reason, I thought this was Heather Allen brewing, not Heater Allen.

A  mildly hazy straw yellow with a dense off-white head with excellent retention and gorgeous lacing, this is a beautiful pilsner. The nose is stunning. Soft, doughy malts with a suffuse Saaz hop character, this beer has a soft, mineral character. The hop character grows, gaining a mildly herbal note. The malt character is fantastic. Yes, its mildly doughy, but its got a mildly fruity component, almost like honeydew melons?

The palate opens crisply bitter with a beautiful balance between the mineral notes and the crisp Saaz hops with a mild resin character. Along with it is the soft malt character, mildly doughy, and with a mildly biscuity pilsner malt character. Exceptionally clean, this beer reminds me of the New Glarus Unplugged Bohemian Lager. Drying and crisply bitter on the finish, this beer has a mild resiny character on the finish. The mouthfeel is fantastic, its got the perfect combination of mellow malt, crisp hops with great balance between flavoring and bittering, and a beautiful fullness to the palate that I expect from the best Czech pilsners. *Just* a touch watery on the finish, I have to ding half a point here cos theres just one part of the back of my palate that isnt experiencing a post-coital glow.

This is about the most graceful beer Ive had this year. It sashays over your palate, enchanting you with its beauty. Highly recommended, this is the best Czech pils thats still brewed (Im looking at you, Dan Carey).","Oregon, USA","dyan"

Aroma of clean crisp grassy and herbalness. Not too hoppy by any means with some grains on the backend... Flavors are a bit of an improvement with a grassy hop nature with a bit of grain and bread on the backend.  
Completely drinkable with a touch of spice coming in late. Clean with a lighter body overall.  Need to try again since my palate was pretty fried at this point.

2803,"2009-11-19",3.7,"22oz - Aroma of straw, hay, pale malts and floral hops.  Flavor is perfectly balanced sweet malts and floral hops.  Palate is creamy and smooth.  A tasty and silky pils.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","MI2CA"
2803,"2009-11-16",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2016 From a 22 oz bottle this poured a very clear golden color with a very nice fat white head and quite decent lacing. The nose is a solid floral and citrus hop and caramel malt aroma.  The moutheel is exceptionally clean and smooth. The flavor is very refreshing, and the the finish is dry and bitter. An exceptionally good plisener. Another bottle this one shared with Strykzone, As good as ever. Goes down really easily, I really like this beer.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
2803,"2009-10-21",4.2,"22oz bottle pours a crystal clear golden with big, frothy white head. Grassy hops and a little sweet malt in the aroma. Taste is cereal/bready malts balanced with a light, but assertive bitterness. Clean, refreshing, and utterly drinkable. This would fit right in if you put it next to a lineup of Czech pilsners. Tastes fresh as can be, but is at least three weeks in the bottle, and probably more. I want more. Please send bottles to WA, and Chuckanut, please start bottling as well.","Seattle, Washington, USA","glkaiser"
2803,"2009-10-18",3.5,"Bottle.  Poured dark orange red with thick white head.  Moderate lacing.  Darker than most pilseners.  Medium aroma of hop, new hay and fresh grass.  Medium flavour, maltier than say.. Pilsener Urquell, balanced.  Lasting hop finish.  Worth having another.","Munchen an der Willamette, Oregon, USA","troopie"
2803,"2009-10-03",3.6,"Bottle shared by Ted. Bold nobel hops and plenty of pilsner malt character in the nose. Lots of herbal hop flavor. Sprite carbonation. Very dry finish. Quality.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
2803,"2009-09-25",4.3,"Hazy bright yellow with a slight orangish tint; medium frothy head settles down without problems. Aroma a little nondescript for a hoppy beer, hard to pin anything specific down, perhaps tree bark. Wonderful hoppy flavor, bready, grassy, a little yeasty, medium bodied. Just incredibly tasty and refreshing, and was this not my only bottle which my awesome friend so thoughtfully brought back for me from Portland Oregon, I would drink this all the time and in large quantities. One of the two best pilsners Ive had to this point.","Medford, Massachusetts, USA","minch25"
2803,"2009-09-07",4.0,"For a pils this is damn good.  Hazy yellow pour.  Light head.  Floral hops, honey, yeast, and light fruitiness in the aroma. Flavor is really well balanced between hops, yeast, dryness, fruitiness and a nice level of carbonation.  Very good beer.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"

2803,"2009-07-14",4.2,"In short: The best and most authentic Czech Republic style Bohemian Pilsner in a bottle?  Probably.
How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed very fresh soon after purchase.  Tasting session with Montreal crew
The look: Cloudy dark yellow body topped by a white ring of foam
In long: Nose offers plenty of noble/Saaz hops and a little blossoming countryside field.  Taste is everything (and more) that I expect from a bohemian pilsner.  Body has a whole lot of cereals with a cookies sensation, a light honey presence and a pillowy mouthfeel.  Finish is very grassy, moderately dry, moderately bitter and with a light spicy/floral notes.  Fruity flavour limited to a light lemony tartness adding to the drinkability.  Basically this is like a one-size-fits all description I give to most excellent bohemian pilsners.  However my scores vary greatly because of those qualities that are hard to put into words.  And this one had a lot going for it.  The freshness sensation was there, the envy to drink 5 pints of it, the disappointment to know that after this bottle we had to drink highly rated imperial stouts/IPAs.  Definitely one of the best bohemian pilsner Ive had in a bottle.  Bye it and drink it FRESH.  Drinking this beer really took me back to my Czech republic pub-crawl, that freshness sensation, the feeling that beer should be drank all the time and everywhere, I swear I could smell a goulash and I couldnt understand what the person who served me the beer was saying.  Although this last part is probably due to Rastacoueres fondness for fifteen letter words.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2803,"2009-07-10",4.0,"On-Tap @ Belmont Station poured into Pint glass.

Pours a pure golden that glows in your glass and has a fluffy white head that never fully dissolves. The aroma is yeast, earthy hops, some nice honey malt aromas and a little biscuit. The flavor has much of the same with the malts being in the forefront and the earthy hops rounding it out. Its flavor is nice and sweet and finishes dry. Its light and very well carbonated. I am by no means a lager-lover but this stuff was damn enjoyable. It wasnt complex but simple and certainly quenched my thirst and then some.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DiabolikDUB"
2803,"2009-07-05",4.3,"The lady behind Belmont Stations counter insisted that we try this new brewery, she was quite proud they had gotten their hands on some of their bottles. I sure am glad she insisted. This beautiful golden liquid wears a fine frothy white head of respectable durability. Remarkably malty from the first whiff, this is fresh to the bone, very soft, pale biscuity pils malts touched with honey nuances. A hefty dose of noble hops procure complimentary grassy, flowery notes. In mouth, from one sip to the other, I switch my mind if its geared more towards malt or hops. Its malts are gorgeous, perfectly extracted pils malts in their prime glory, rendering a relatively thick, gently oily palate whose softness is humbling. At the same time, you could never call it sweet Besides the first millisecond, it grows into dry territory with a crisp, tight and invigorating bitterness. Agressivity is nowhere to be found. This is just a tool to combine utmost refreshment with flavour. While perfectly clean, it has this farmy feel with its mere basic ingredients feeling all so pure and various hints reminiscent of nature and being outdoor. Thats another thing, you could drink it inside your home and youd feel like you were on top of a mountain. The slightest vegetal DMS undertones are not a nuisance, more or less contributing a green herbal addition to the already deep hop profile. Possibly my favourite American pilsner. An absolute must.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2803,"2009-06-21",3.7,"Bottle...   Poured hazy golden/orange with a white head.  Aroma of grains and fresh hops.  Definitely more malt driven like the description said.  Honey sweetness and an earthy vegetable character.  Very refreshing an clean.  One of the way better pilsners out there.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
2803,"2009-05-01",3.8,"22 oz bottle from Market of Choice. Bright golden-amber pour with a thin white head and minimal lacing. Nice aroma of grassy, earthy hops and caramel malts. Flavor much the same, the hops a little bit more prominent than I expected, which is just how I like them. Very crisp finish, would be a great hot weather beer.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","Beardface"
2803,"2009-03-03",2.6,"I was expecting a glass on Anthrax with this lager,but was surprised to find a clean (read low hopped)& OK drinking lager.I actually have a soft spot  for Corona when wanting to hit the swill,so what do I know ?","Brentford, Greater London, ENGLAND","Gary"
2803,"2009-02-03",3.8,"Pours clear amber from the 22 ounce bottle with one finger white head. Few lacings. Aroma is light malts. Taste is bitter hops with a good amount of sweet malts. Mouthfeel is perfect carbonation and a bitter dry finish. Overall a fabulous Pils with just the right amount of NW punch to make it a must have Pils. Sessionability is exceptional. I would like to see this beer in a face off with Prima Pils. I think H-A Pils would win.","Salem, Oregon, USA","spikester"
2803,"2008-12-15",3.6,"Bottle shared by bvc. Golden amber beer with a thin head.  Bready sweetness on the nose. Grass, lemon maybe. Bread, sweet grain. Grass and peppery bitterness in the finish. Incredibly clean and crisp. Enjoyable stuff.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2803,"2008-12-10",3.6,"22. Thanks, BVC! Pours a murky to opaque burnished darkish amber with a thin, sudsy white head. Attractive for sure. Looks bigger than a pils. Nutty, slightly toasted-corn-y, wet-grass-y nose. Serious pils territory there. Creamy medium body. Does not have the graininess of an ale body, but it certainly does not lack for assertiveness. Corn nuts, grass, some biscuit on the mid-palate. Light, dry, nutty finish. Supremely drinkable.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2803,"2008-10-26",3.8,"Bottle generously shared by theisti. Pours a hazy gold with a thin white ring of bubbles clinging to the edge of the glass. The nose is bright and yeasty with fruity and mineral notes that impart a saison-like quality upon the aroma. Light bodied and minerally with a crisp, dry finish. The flavor follows the nose with an emphasis on the mineral note. A nice pilsener to be sure. Thanks for sharing this with us, Tim.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"
2803,"2008-10-20",3.6,"Bottle. The body was dark gold with a thin white colored head. The aroma was malty sweet potatoes along with a little bit of nutty character. Some rich bread crust in the taste. There was also a little bit of bitter grass. Well done.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
2803,"2008-10-13",4.1,"Pours deep gold, light haziness in the bottled version, the tap version is a bit more clear. Very crisp and clean pils, earthy and grassy hops, delicious malt flavor up front. This is one of the best pilsners I can remember, the tap version seems to bring out the hops a touch more, a bit more grassy character, the bottled version is a bit more malt forward, both very nice.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
2803,"2008-10-08",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 19, 2008 22 oz bottle graciously provided by DA. This beer was brought to my attention by bvc, who said he thought I would really enjoy it.  Pour is cloudy golden yellow orange with great settling and a one inch clean white head that falls fairly quickly. Pretty in the glass, visibly unfiltered. Aroma is earthy, herbal hops, there is a bit of bitter edge of orange citrus.  Some floral mixed in to the nose; a fresh and complex nose.  Taste is earthy, grassy,  herbally, slightly bitter orange citrus and chunky, chewy maltiness - really alive and unfiltered.  Nice mineral element throughout.  The hops and malt are both present, vibrant and balanced.  The flavors are clean, straightforward and simple in their way, but delicious.  Wow, really nice one. Perfect mix of being crisply satisfying and drinkable. Thanks to Derek for sending this gem my way, thanks to Brandon for telling me about this beer - you were right!","Kansas, USA","theisti"
