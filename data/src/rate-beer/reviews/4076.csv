Flavour begins with a mix of orange peel and nuts, maybe some light pit fruit, along with a moderate wood and cellar character. That builds towards the finish, becoming increasingly dominated by medicinal old hops and extremely tannic wood. That bitter woodiness carries on and on long into the aftertaste.

Almost mead-like fermented honeyish onset adorned with lots of fruity esters, but expectedly more noble and sedate than in the young lambic Girardin; soft but persisting tartness, more a fluffy lactic acidity than sharp and biting lemon acidity, very complex, fruity finish with a big drying oakiness, light bitter, dryingly sour and very quenching.

Pours like a caramel-intense flat faro or an old sherry...not the last association with sherry. Nose is quite reticent, not at all heavy on acids or brett, instead natural wood tones, sweet sherry caramels and whisky malt honey associations, young cheese, Old buttermilk, must, damp cellar, pickled orange rind, peach blossom. - Really shines in the unexpected bitter orange taste: massive wood tones, spruce, shrubbery and then orange orchard, lemon zest pushed away by again sweet bitter orange, a manifest old hop bitterness, natural caramel (beetroot sugar), barnyard, umami/oily. Lingering sherrywood and chestnut peel bitterness. Mouthfeel quite unique as well: both very ""meaty"" and like a cheeseplate, umami and savoury-bitter all around: the butterscotch pediococcus is strong in this Chardonnay-like texture. - - Like a desugared Faro or an earthy, desoured Gutedel, nothing like a lactic/sour Jonge Lambiek. Muddy midway between sweet tea and unfinished wine. Quite the experience really. Maybe only missing a refreshing touch of actual tartness here and this would be my summer sessioner. Now to cater this to the unsuspecting palates outre-rhin... // Rerate: 3x10L Bags in a box later, it is probably safe to say this would be my desert island beer: complex and infinitely drinkable, hard to tap just one pint: meaty and cheesy, yet zesty and refreshing. Oily in texture, goes down like real ale. Matures to an assertive old hop bitterness that can rival an IPAs. Lovely old lemon rind aromas, a bite like custard...Sublime and as multi-faceted as Orval.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

4076,"2014-07-01",3.5,"Wanted to get down some notes on this...

Pour from a bag-in-a-box (Thanks Levi!) is a very clear, surprisingly dark amber pour with no head. No lacing to speak of. Aroma is wet wood notes, with the oak being more prominent than I would have thought, especially when its pointed out. Very ""funky"" smelling, in a cheesy, wet dog, sweaty sock sort of way, without becoming overpowering or off putting. A bit of the lactic and citric tartness for which Girardin Black Label is known pushes through and really brightens up the experience. The pineapple and grapefruit is there, but quite subdued. Taste is a fair bit of that same funk, more tart than the aroma lets on. The malt profile is surprisingly present, with a fair bit of caramel character, and quite a bit of that Cheerio/cracker character on the finish that I have often gotten in some young bottled home-brewed sours (And often attribute to priming sugar/residual extract). Caramel malt character. A vegetal note that I attribute to hops, though without the bitterness/pithyness that we have gotten in some of our beers brewed with aged hops...better source/older hops? Finish is fairly drying, with the classic Girardin sour elements of citrus fruit and bright acidity. Still quite a bit of body for a sour beer, and a flat one at that. Overall, a very unique experience that has made me think a lot about the state of some of our ""young"" sour projects. Very fun to see where some of Girardins beer starts...a really interesting and surprising experience to be sure.","California, USA","LamarBurton"

4076,"2009-11-19",3.4,"Served from a 10 liter bag-in-box. The box was filled at the brewery sometime during 15-16 August 2009. Sampling date: 2009-08-23.

Slightly hazy brownish copper color and no head - just a few large bubbles that quickly disappear.

Some musty aromas of apples and lots of grape-like fruit aromas. Hints of lemon. Surprisingly prominent notes of malts. Muted funkiness and a gentle note of vinegar.

The taste is rather sweet at first and almost malty, but then develops a pleasant tartness. Fruity notes of apples, lemon and white grapes (grapefruit?). Gentle earthy funkiness. The finish is bone dry and tart, with notes of grass and mild spices.

Moderate body, smooth texture and a very very dry finish. Impressive and different. Absolutely no carbonation.

This was very interesting to try. Its surprisingly sweet and gentle, perhaps to mild to be truly amazing. It lacks some character, but it was tasty and rather refreshing.

Pours flat and looks exactly like the jonge lambic- nice clear beautiful tawny, biscuity and similar appearance to a nice scotch or whiskey.  Aroma is a bit more woody, and more funky- but still has an off sweetness- ligth acidity, with some garbage and just off smells- boxed version is cleaned up a bit but has more acetaldehyde and solventy acetone notes, green apple, light sugary sweetness and hints of both dms and diacetyl.  Flavor is a bit bland- some spongy cork, dusty oak and wood, some weird off funk, off metallic astringency and just not pleasant.  Finish isnt as smooth or even as acidic as the jonge lambic- how the hell does that work?  Box was better than the bottle- being a bit more complex, not as thin or watery, still tons of acetaldehyde and strange wild acids that may mellow in time- a bit more horsey and funky- may just be a slightly better batch this time- but overall quite similar to what I remmeber in the bottle when Armand shared some with us. This  bottle was the only thing I couldnt finish along with the lindemans kriek we had that night at Tria.

It is definitely the Oude version though. Dark orange shade, clearish. Flowery, perfumey aroma with bright, rather fresh orange blossom and tea-like grapefruit. Stupendous. Very classy, elegant, balanced from start to finish. Flat bodied with fair fruity, white grape tannins. Lots of evolving floral notes. Not so funky at this age, more playing the classy game. Friendly yeast, but complex and quite intense. In a very pleasant phase of its evolution at this age. Remarkabe quality.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
