1907,"2016-05-21",3.2,"On tap at Wig & Pen, pours a hazy bronze with a small beige head. Aroma brings out a good citrus and pine hop component, and biscuity malt on the underside. Flavour is along the same lines, with piney hops, some light citrus and a bone dry biscuity malt backbone. Well-balanced and drinkable. Solid.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1907,"2016-01-06",4.3,"I dont know what this beer is like normally, but they poured it through a Randall and damn if that didnt do the trick. Hazy and light amber. Thin head. Stick your head in a bag of hops...sauvin and galaxy(its actually NZ Galaxy). Ultra bitter, but with pale malt backing, no chewy shit. Ballsy APA.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1907,"2015-08-03",3.3,"Light tropical fruit on nose. Bit too much effervescent tang on the taste for me. Not bad just not great.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","stoutnick"
1907,"2015-04-30",3.4,"Very dark brown color with a bit of caramel in the nose. Very malty with toffee, coffee and modest body. Not bad.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
1907,"2014-08-07",3.0,"Taste at the wig and pen. Had a sort of passionfruit aroma - apparently they use only one hop in this (galaxy, I think they said). It was not bad but I prefer other beers of theirs with more pronounced hop flavours.","Los Angeles, California, USA","RafeAU"
1907,"2012-12-07",3.4,"Tap. Clear golden amber with a cream head. Aroma of gooseberry, biscuit, passionfruit - v sav blancy. Light bodied. Tastes as it smells with firm slightly spicy bitterness. Wouldnt have minded just a little more sweetness. Refreshing, nice balance of fruity flavours but neither hoppy enough to be just about them or with enough presence to be wholly satisfying.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
1907,"2012-09-15",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub. Served a clear golden color with a small head that fades to nice lacing. Aroma of citrus and bit of caramel sweetness. Taste of so me caramel sweetness and bit of fruit, with a trace of grain in the background. Nice bitterness and a clean finish. Medium body, smooth with a bit of a creamy texture. Well balanced. Very enjoyable beer, nice flavor with a bit of character. Worth a try.","St. Charles, Missouri, USA","Bif"

1907,"2011-02-09",4.2,"Tap. Amazing beer. Aromas of caramel, berries, and tomato. Predominantly sweet, with very long length. Palate is velvety, with a thin-to-medium body. Red, with a frothy head.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","davidm"
1907,"2011-01-24",3.7,"On tap at the brewpub. Pick of the beers for me at Wig & Pen. Went straight to pints of this once Id gone through the samples of each tap.

Pours a clear golden copper, with a small but thick off white head. Aroma is a pungent piney grapefruit, reminds me a lot of galaxy IPA from bridge road. Taste is tropical, with a dominant piney hop and some oak. Bitter finish. Beautiful!

Unless they had the kegs hooked up to the wrong taps, this is far better than the regular pale ale in my opinion.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","ndon"

1907,"2009-08-29",2.8,"...on tap there.  Very smooth, nice hoppy but not overpowering nose.  Well balanced, crisp, clean, flavorful.  Had some nice citrus type flavors, with a tropical edge.  Nice one, great lacing, hand pumped beer.","Central Florida(Upper Hell), Florida, USA","UnholyBrewing"

1907,"2008-11-20",3.2,"On tap  at the Wig & Pen. Arrived golden orange with an averaged sized, frothy white head which was mostly lasting. A tropical fruity hop aroma with strong notes of grapefruit, passionfruit, tangerines, sweet caramel malts and some intriguing earthy/woody notes (cedar perhaps?). Flavor was a moderate grassy hop bitterness with sweet biscuity malts, pineapple, dry nectarines, light notes of mango & passionfruit and a strong dry/grainy finish. Medium bodied with soft carbonation, a dry mouthfeel and a good finish.","Southern Highlands, AUSTRALIA","MBison"
