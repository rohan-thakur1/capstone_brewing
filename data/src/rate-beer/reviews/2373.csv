2373,"2014-06-09",2.9,"My Bottom Line:
Caramel/butterscotch notes pierce citrusy hops and doughy yeast, while mild acidity morphs into a peanut-like aftertaste.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A stable cloud of foam tops the murky dark amber.
-The acidic touch in the finish clashes with the resinous bitterness.
-Cant tell if this is fresh or really tired (there is no date on the bottle...).
-Effervescence is rather expansive which, with the acidity, points towards an infection.
-Hops are also grassy throughout.

2373,"2014-03-31",4.1,"Clear deep brown and amber coloured body with a great violet and deep ruby glow and a decent two centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of pungent resin and piney hop smells, some toffee and caramel sweetness and a nice rich malt and nutty scent as well. Medium-bodied; Assertive hop flavours up front with a very nice nutty and caramel toffee maltiness with a lot of depth and complexity. Aftertaste shows the complexity of the flavours combining, but the balance of resinous and piney hops coupled with the toffee and nutty maltiness goes well and shows an added layer of depth. Overall, a very nice beer and definitely fits in this category, and quite simply - is one of the best Ambers Ive had as well -this one deserves to be drunk if you can find it!
