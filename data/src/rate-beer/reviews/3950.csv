3950,"2017-06-21",3.2,"Bottle - Perfumy fresh and not sweet lychee. Sweet lychee juice and a touch of sake.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
3950,"2016-07-05",2.3,"Sampled from a 0.75l bottle @ RBNG 2014. It definitely smells of lychee this! Almost like sniffing on a juice can. Looks like water. Rice also on the nose. Its really far out there on the sweet path this. Sweet wood juice, loaded with canned fruitiness. Not even a hint of any alcohol here. A egg glass is enough. A tad to sweet for me, and dare I say infused? 15.02.2014","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"
3950,"2016-04-08",3.3,"(Échantillon chez Lanna): Pratiquement un jus de poire, roses et lychee, svelte et très sucré. Inoffensif.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"

3950,"2016-01-01",3.2,"This bottled Sake from a restaurant poured no head and a uncarbonated transparent clear colored body. The weak aroma was dirty and hard for me to describe otherwise. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a mellow sweet aftertaste. The nice flavor contained floral notes. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
3950,"2015-06-13",1.8,"As a fan of lychee, I decided to try this. Nice aroma but almost a bit too sweet. Flavor of lychee but it is way too sweet. Some perfume in there as well.

I thought it could be a bad bottle but it seems most of them are like this also. As someone who wanted a good cheap lychee sake, Im disappointed.","Fair Lawn, New Jersey, USA","KoRoBeNiKi"
3950,"2015-05-04",2.9,"Sampled with a sake flight at a local Asian place. From notes. Very sweet, like ""fruit cocktail"" flavor. Maybe thats lychee...meh.","Rockford, Illinois, USA","jmagnus87"

3950,"2014-03-20",3.0,"Thank you Cunningham ! This one is really special as it develops it classy rice aroma just in the end. Until that point you have to fight with sweet lychees. And you can only like them if you are a fan. I am not. But - good brew at all.","Wanne-Eickel, GERMANY","MichaelAwesome"
3950,"2014-03-18",3.1,"Bottle from Cunningham - thank you so much, Henrik! The sake pours out in a vanilla-rose colour with smooth body. Aroma of coconut and pineapple. Taste of lychee juice, coconut and peaches. I really missed the sake taste and found it a little bit too girly - but otherwise really drinkable and nice.","Reutlingen, GERMANY","McTapps"
3950,"2014-03-07",2.9,"Bottle sample @ RBNG-14. Water-like clear body. Aroma is lychee, rice, coconut, faint fusel tones and hints of alcohol. Taste is lychee, mild rice, coconut, marzipan and mild fruity tones. Smooth body, pretty light. Sweet, but half-decent enough.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"
3950,"2014-03-01",3.2,"Looks like water. When you drink it, you notice that it is completely different from water. Not the ususal basement sake either. I can recommend this one! Coconuts and fruity aroma. Mid bodied. Very flat and a balanced sweetness. Pleasant fruity, nutty and oily. [Bottle at Grand Tasting RBNG14  Halden]","Halden, NORWAY","Cunningham"

3950,"2014-02-16",2.2,"Looks like water. Yay. Sweet sugary aroma of coconut suntan oil and fruit cocktail. Heavy sweet taste with more sugary fruity cocktail. Might work as a liqueur substitute.

3950,"2013-08-14",2.4,"Bottle at Chris Os pre-GBBF shindig, 2013. Clear pour. Fruit syrup aroma. More fruit syrup in the flavour, like the juice from the fruit cocktail tins back in the 70s/80s. Are they still about?","Lee, Greater London, ENGLAND","planky84"
3950,"2013-08-11",3.4,"Bottle at the 2013 ChrisO Pre-GBBF Shindig - London. I picked this one up in London, somewhere around Covent Garden/ Soho, near Chinatown like. Pours clear with pretty much no color. Highly floral aroma, some violets, ripe fruits. Medium to heavy sweet flavor with lots of sugary fruit, lychee, super floral notes, some light vanilla accents. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Sugary finish with more sweet fruit and flowers. Novel stuff. Quite different from standard, non-fruited sakes.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
3950,"2013-08-11",2.2,"Bottle at ChrisOs pre-GBBF Shindig 2013. My first sake rating and an inauspicious one unfortunately. Colour is almost clear with a hint of yellow. Nose and taste is basically what you would expect from concentrated lychee cordial. Strong sweet sugary lychee. some strong tropical and floral and a bit of sour lychee almost gooseberry tang. Far too sweet and unsubtle though. No trace of sake/rice wine taste.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","EdKing"

3950,"2013-02-06",3.2,"notes: pours clear ultra-light white wine yellow. Very aromatic though somewhat artificial lychee. Drinks with the same aromatic lychee, 5/10-sweetness, filtered apple juice, light-medium tanginess, transitioning nicely into smooth rice wine, finishing semi-sweet, clean, and partially thin. Low-medium complexity, low-medium depth, good transitions, okay carry, very nice drinkability.","","sulawang"

3950,"2008-06-13",3.2,"Bottle: Pours a clear color without any legs. Nose of fresh lychee fruit, perhaps the lychees in syrup. A bit of peach and mint as well. No sake notes in the flavor. Good, fresh tasting with a light bitterness. Clean, but certainly NOT sake. Lychee apperatif.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3950,"2007-10-02",3.1,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2008 Poured into flute from 750ml bottle.  This is for people who dont like sake.  The only flavour is lychee.  Still nice for dessert with dark chocolate.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"
3950,"2007-03-31",3.3,"Well lets give this a whirl, know nothing too much about Sake and usually not a big fan (probably only had the bad kind).  Chilled and poured into a port wine glass.  Color is water clear (normal or not?).  Aroma is all sweet lychee, very perfume-y, and other sweet tropical fruits.  No alcohol at all, smells like a nicely sweetened water without going over the top.  Taste is similarly sweetened water with just a the faintest indication that it may be alcohol.  I am enjoying the crap out of it right now (I love lychee) but I feel like I am cheating kind of like alcohol-pop beverages.  But my inexperience leads to me to rate it well enough.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
