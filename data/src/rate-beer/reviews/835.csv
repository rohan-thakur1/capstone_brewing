835,"2010-10-22",3.6,"hazy yellow, white bubbles rim glass for a head, some lace.  nose of grain and hops.  nice grainy flavor with offsetting bitter hops.  medium finish, light bitter finish.  very well hidden alcohol, considering the 8.6 abv.  a tasty, if high octane, brew.  sampled at rockfest 2010.","Monee, Illinois, USA","dm9831"
835,"2010-05-30",3.5,"A golden lager with a thin white head. A chally hoppy aroma with tangerine fizz notes. In mouth, a smooth hoppy lager, with light tingle, biscuitty malt, quite nice and clean.  On tap at Rockfest, April 25 2010.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
835,"2010-05-28",3.6,"Draft at Rockfest. Pours a hazy straw color with fluffy pils head. Sticky. Nose is full of hops here with Noble & American varieties battling it out. They seem to come together quite well, with sweet pils notes in the background. Clean taste with restrained and soft bitterness. Alcohol is hidden. Finishes dry. Pretty damn good stuff.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
835,"2009-08-27",3.7,"Sampled at the brewpub and poured a hazy, light gold, with a white, bubbly head which reduced to a film and left some good, web-like lacing. The aroma was noble and pils malt in a moderate combination. Maybe a hint of sweetness in the flavor, but over shadowed by a potent alcohol presense and strong hop bitterness, leading to a nice, dry finish.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
835,"2008-07-03",3.9,"Poured on tap at Yorktown. Pours a golden slightly hazy straw in a pilsner glass. Prominent fluffy white head that slowly dissipated and laced beautifully during the whole experience. Aromas are floral hops and pilsner bready malts. Very floral initial taste with bready pilsner malts on a less prominent factor. The hops steal the show but are balanced marvelously with the pilsner malts. Flavorful, succulent, and top notch. Very pleasant aftertaste that lets you remember the sweet nectar you just enjoyed. Cheers!","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
835,"2008-06-12",3.9,"6/11/08  Thanks to Andrew for this pour from a growler filled 5 days earlier.  As andrew fills my mug in the park, everything about this beer screams fresh from the tap.  Clear golden yellow with a white thick head.  Hoppy delicious nose.  Rich with caramels, citrus, grass, herbal and spicy hops.  Smooth body and so fresh tasting.  Rich caramel malts with earthy, floral, herbal, and spicy noble hops.  Finishes with a slight bitterness.  Really tasty brew.  I could drink a lot of this.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"
835,"2008-06-11",4.0,"This one poured golden in color and had a rather complex nose of citrus, spice, wheat and and herbal funk.  The palate was powerful and concentrated showing off ther herbaceousness in the finish.  A powerful summer beer!","Wheaton, Illinois, USA","SQNfan"

835,"2008-06-01",3.9,"Pour is deep golden with a thin sticky white head...smell is strongly hoppy with grass and is also lightly doughy...taste is doughy sweet at first with a growing spicy hop character of grassyness, pepper, and herbal flavors....finish is a lingerly bitter with some grapefruit....well done!","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
835,"2008-05-22",4.1,"this beer was seriously tasty.  clear golden pour.  larger then expected hop  aaroma and flavor mixed with a grassy mellowness and light malt backbone.  wanted ( and got) more.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","Dough77"
835,"2008-05-15",3.8,"Tall Pilsener glass at RB. A slightly brassy yellow under an inch-high, bubbly head. Looks kinda normal, donnit? Big grassy and spicy hop smell, nearly obliterating the usual ""beer"" smell I get with a light lager. Taste has Imperial IPA levels of piny hops, with a definite fresh, green character. Malts tend a little to the caramel roast bit of the spectrum, but there is a lager ""cleanness"" that keeps it from tasting like yet another IIPA. Rings of lacy lacy foam on the glass after each drink. Sharp prickly carbonation brings out the pils character toward the bottom. Very drinkable, but noticeably intoxicating. Good thing this browser has spellcheck.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
835,"2008-05-12",3.7,"Draught at the pub.  Golden with a thick foamy white head.  Sweet PNW aromatic hops nose.  the flavor showcases your typical pilsener hops along with a strong sweet body along with some citrusy flavors.  Very good, medium bodied with a pleasant lingering aftertaste.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","kseecs16"
835,"2008-05-10",3.8,"Drinking a Lord Tufnels Imperial Pilz - My second was poured into a Pilsener glass (the mug-full was a pleasant mistake) because this RB doesnt mug-it when the beer is over 8% ABV.  Because of that strong ABV and absurd hopping, I requested this be changed to, alas, the European Strong Lager category.  Be that as it may...What we actually have here is another IPL (India Pale Lager), and its a dandy.  It has a clear golden body with a creamy, sustained head that provides plenty of lacing.  The aroma has an underlying warm bread and toasty grain sweetness that nearly gets buried by the hoppy scents of yellow grapefruit, zest of lemon, and bitter grasses.  The flavor begins with that malty sweetness, but the tastebuds are soon whalloped by an onslaught of hop (Screw the shortage!) bitterness, the PNW hops dominating, but the grassy/herbal European hops playing a strong supportive role.  The finish is dry and refreshingly bitter.  Yet another fine brew by Tim Marshall.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

835,"2008-05-09",2.6,"On tap at Rock Bottom Yorktown. Rock Bottom Yorktown Lord Tufnells Imperial Pilsener is a hazy yellow color with a great white head. The aroma is hoppy with with some grassy and earthy tones. The taste is bad, but the aftertaste is worse. It is a bit stale with a bad mixture of earthy/grassy tones and hops. The finish is dry which forces the flavor to stay with you for a while.","New York, New York, USA","mgoy"
