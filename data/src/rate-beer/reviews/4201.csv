4201,"2017-01-31",3.7,"Japan Brewers Cup. Nice aroma of dark fruit, caramel and touch of smoke. Bit of spice. Taste is good, with all the above, but lacking something.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
4201,"2013-05-07",3.7,"Bottle at RBJG#2 Grand Tasting. Pours a clear dark brown with aromas of caramel and residual sugars and hints of black pepper. Dry finish.","Copenhagen OE, DENMARK","sunevdj"
4201,"2013-04-29",3.5,"Bottle at RBJG#2 - Grand Tasting Ueno Park. Dark brown - offwhite head. Roasted, ryebread, sweetness, spicy notes, berries, dried fruits, raisins, light bitterness.","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Theis"
4201,"2013-04-25",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Munich malts galore contribute caramel to go alongside floral hops, a combo creating cherry-like allusions in this rich and easygoing Dunkler Bock.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the dark brown with red highlights.
-Hops add an earthy touch in the finish, this is still a malt-forward Bock.
-This lager is much better than the ones we had on tap at the brewery earlier. Perhaps it was actually lagered for over a month ?
-Mouthfeel was well-structured ; sturdy enough and comfortable for big gulps as well.

4201,"2012-10-21",3.8,"Bottle swapped with Tim Eustace in Jan 12. Looks like a beautiful beer. Opaque very dark brown with nice medium tan head. Nose is milky, roasted malt, milk chocolate, quite a lot of lactic creaminess.Taste is roasted malt, milk chocolate, bit of black coffee, lactic milkiness, tiny bit of dark fruit. Its a bock that is more like a stout. Very nice beer and a nice bit of milk chocolate stickiness on the finish. Well balanced between roasted and sweetness and not cloying at all.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","EdKing"
4201,"2011-11-27",3.5,"This is a BIG beer. Really full. Almost solid state! Quite somkey, with chocolate and dark fruit dominating. Rich pudding with a soft bitterness. Like a christmas cake without the spices. Well done but a bit overbearing.","JAPAN","jonno"
4201,"2008-12-08",3.4,"Black as pitch, thick looking, with a medium tan head. Strong roasted barley aroma, dry and burnt, unlike a bock, slightly creamy and nutty with cocoa and just a touch of dark fruit. Dry burnt malt flavor, creamy, chocolate, coffee, slight dark fruits, a touch of smoke or peat. Tastes more like an export stout. I would bet there is roasted barley in there. Quite nice, really, but there is little bock about it.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
4201,"2007-10-07",3.7,"Sampled @ GJBF Yokohama: Dark black, nose of light fruit and dry dark malt, some sweet plum. Sweet body and a clean finish. Chewy, balanced.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
4201,"2007-09-16",3.8,"@ GJBF 2007.  Dark brown with a thick, tan head.  Aroma is chocolate, sweet caramel malts, some milk.  Flavor is similar, with plenty of tasty powdered chocolate, roasted malts, light smoke, and milk.  Id love to find a few bottles of this, this winter.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
4201,"2006-01-06",3.8,"Very dark brown color. Big toffee, milk chocolate nose. Smooth, milk chocolate, hazelnut, toffee mouth and a milk chocolatey finish. Probably the best Christmas beer in Japan","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
