910,"2017-04-11",3.9,"Coppery brown with a good cream colored head. Not much aroma - like a dry dusty attic. Flavor is a combination of earthy, herbal and caramel. Bitterness is perfect for the style. Other than a nondescript aroma this is a great Steam Beer.","Windsor, California, USA","DavidWoodruff"
910,"2017-03-12",3.7,"(St. Florians California Common Lager) Bottle 355ml at home, served into a shaker, ABV 6%
Amber coloured body, clear, with a tall and thick beige head on top, good retention.
Aroma of caramel, light toffee, biscuit, hints of hops.
Taste is more hoppy than the aroma indicated, again light caramel and toffee towards the end, very refreshing.
Medium body with good carbonation, mildly dry on the palate.
Great.","Arnhem, NETHERLANDS","Christos"
910,"2017-02-25",3.4,"Bottle bought online somewhere, cant even remember where... Anyway: steam beer is one of those very rare classic (19th century) beer styles that have originated in the United States and the only one of those still in existence, thanks to Anchor, which patented the name Steam after having reinvented the style around 1970; later American craft breweries, like this one, are therefore obliged to use the term California common but its hard not to imagine that all other examples are merely a tribute to Anchor Steam, being basically the first true American craft beer and in that sense the beer responsible for the incredible revolution in innovative brewing which is flooding the world now. Im happy to have found another true Californian example, to put the legendary Anchor Steam into perspective... Thick and frothy, regular, dense, pale yellowish beige head over a clear, beautifully deep and pure amber beer with copper red hue, showing lots of pale yeast dots throughout. Dunkler Bock-like aroma of cookie dough, dry cake, caramel, iron, Turkish delight, wet cloth, rainwater, marmelade, straw, toasted peanuts, dust. Sweetish onset with a notable neutral kind of sourish undercurrent, no real esters but rather malt fruitiness, minerally flavors, metallic side notes persisting till deep into the finish; mouthfeel is slick and supple, bit metallic as said but with sufficient body for a 6% beer, carbonation is spritzy and a bit on the sharp side. Caramelly, slightly resinous malt sweetness in the middle, nutty with a softly bitterish toasted edge in the end, leading to a rather thin, even somewhat watery finish low in hops, though a peppery and very lightly orange peel-ish bitter flavor does arise and lingers a bit after swallowing. A pleasantly bready note shows up in the very end, minerally flavors linger along, the rainwater-like aroma rises up retronasally and the metallic side aspect persists. Clearly a malt-forward lager showing the affinity with 19th-century German Lager culture this beer style has, could easily pass for a dark Bockbier if it were situated in Europe; Id have to revisit Anchor Steam, which was not just the first American craft beer to the world but also to me personally, in order to make any comparison but from sheer memory, Id say this one is more metallic, a tad less hoppy and feeling a bit thinner - but Ill get back to that next time I encounter Anchor Steam again. In any case: pleasant enough, straightforward, malty lager, but I fear this style is nowadays a bit lost in the much more extreme American craft beers it has paved the way for. I was never a great lager fan but generally speaking, this is among the more enjoyable ones I had so far.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

910,"2014-06-22",3.5,"Bottle (22oz): Clear deep copper, thick head and good lace. Caramle and fruit. Dried fruit. Fresh yeast, ester notes. Clean. relatively simple but great example. Off dry, not sour and moderately bitter. Nice weight and length. Malt dominated the flavor. Caramel and mocha flavors.","Napa, California, USA","VinegarStroke"
910,"2014-04-16",2.7,"Poured from a 22oz bottle. 
Aroma is fairly malty with toasted bread, caramel, and light toffee notes. Hints of raisins, plums and nuts. Light, grassy hop aroma. Medium light floral esters. 
Pours a fairly clear, amber brown with ruby hues and a fairly large, thick, dark tan head. This is darker than i was expecting for a Cal. Common. Medium lacing and legs. 
Flavor is also fairly malty with moderately strong toasted bread, caramel and toffee with hints of tootsie rolls. Medium sweetness balanced by moderate bitterness. Faint grassy and woodsy hop flavors. Moderate notes of raisin and plums with a fairly strong fruity and floral ester profile including hints of banana. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation and a bit of a sticky sweetness to it. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall I am not sure this should be called a California Common. The ester profile is way too high, the malt character too dark and under attenuated, and there is not enough of the hop profile for the style. While drinkable, this is more similar in flavor and aroma to a small doppelbock.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
910,"2014-01-30",3.0,"I was put off by the first taste but it grew on me. Not much hops aroma or taste, falls more on the malty side. Not bitter at all. Drinkable but not great.

910,"2014-01-13",3.6,"Format: Bottle from Whole Foods, Redwood City CA
Appearance: Ruby amber
Aroma: Fruity malts, sweet flowers, apple juice, hops
Taste: Lightly malted sweet notes balanced by a earthy hoppiness
Texture: Little carbonation, medium body
Overall: A very pleasant aroma of apple juice and sweet floral nectars leads into a pretty nice tasting beer. At its worst, the flavors can dip a little too sweet (malts) or dirty earth (hops).","Redwood City, California, USA","tightslice"
