Aroma of coriander and wheat. Flavor was a little off for me because i drank it too cold so most of the flavors didnt come out even though i let it warm a bit.

The aroma was mild with a grain malt and a light soapy yeast with a hint of citrus (lemon and orange), a touch of coriander and a mild note of pepper.

The taste was lightly citrusy throughout with a decent wheat presence stepping up only to be slightly overshadowed by a somewhat bold spiciness at the end. The flavor hung on for a good while after the swallow, with a citrusy and mildly peppery taste that was left to linger at the back of the throat.

The appearance had a hazy yellow colored body with a thin one fingered white foamy head that died within about a minute.
The smell had an almost perfect blessing of coriander spices to a lemon citrus blend that adds a spectacular sweetness and just enough yeastiness to assist in a wonderful spectacular aroma.
The taste was sweet to spicy with the citruses of lemon and orange to exemplify a more than adequate flavoring for an American brewer for a witbier. The aftertaste is slightly spicy and citrusy. The finish is not as dry as expected but still felt dry and quick as I did expect.
The palate is about a light to medium, and fairly sessionable. Carbonation is just right for a Witbier and its good to me as well.

A: Pours a hazy straw color with lots of chunky sediment. Theres about one fingers worth of white colored head. Both retention and lacing are pretty good.

S: Spicy. Theres a good amount of coriander, black pepper, sage, and orange peel, offset slightly by the sweet malts. Only detraction: the aroma seems oddly ham-like and smoky. For some reason, it reminds me of opening a can of Underwood deviled ham - this quality is really hard to shake off.

T: Luckily the flavor works better. Mild candied sugar combines with orange peel to start it off, and it finishes with plenty of coriander, sage, and other assorted garden herbs. Wheat flavors help bridge the opening with its clean, spicy finish. Theres a good combination of spicy and sweet here.

M: While it is a touch too sweet and a touch too flabby, the finish is pleasantly dry and the carbonation pokes through enough to help it go down well. It certainly hasnt lost much drinkability over its smaller brethren. 

O: I really get where they were going with this: its definitely bigger than the average wit, but not moronically so. Since this isnt a style that should be imperialized, it still works quite well (aroma notwithstanding).

4605,"2012-08-20",3.7,"Youve probably heard of ""Double IPAs"" but now a new niche style seems to be emerging - the ""Double Witbier"" which Im all for because I find regular witbiers to be a little too mild. But if youre going to ""double"" a witbier the outcome should be a little more impressive than a standard good beer, and thats what Southamptoon Double White is - a good witbier with a little more to it, but nothing amazing.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.

Appearance: White gold color, but opaque with haziness. Forms a small, white, soapy head which leaves minor lacing.

Smell: Orange and lemon pith but not ""citrusy"" per se. A touch of spice.

Taste: Mild fruit flavors up front. Since its brewed with orange lemon peel its not surprising it has a citrusy flavor to it, sans tartness and acidity. Little to no bitterness through the middle, but a touch of coriander spice. The finish is the best part with a remarkably sweet, almost candy-like taste of orange and lemon. Its basically the same palate youd get in any other brew of the style, just a bit more energy to it. Perhaps my bottle was old (and I wouldnt doubt it), but its all I have to go by. At least theres no dryness whatsoever, in fact its quite refreshing considering the style and bigger body than most. Tasty to be sure, but nothing in the ballpark of amazing.

Drinkability: Most witbiers brewed in the traditionally Belgian style tend to be low in weight and alcohol. Southamptoon Double White is a bit bigger at 6.6% ABV, but its just as easy to drink as the smaller beers. The body is thin, wet, and surprisingly tepid. Theres an almost watery texture to the body as well, but I wouldnt describe it as weak - just maybe a little too mild for its own good. I dont think any drinker of any experience level will have any trouble with this brew whatsoever.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

From bottle. This beer taste completely different than it used to. I bought a six pack and the bottles have a slightly different looking label, with the overall design being the same. But the beer taste much different, in a very disappointing way. Smell like malts and weak spices. Taste is malty, grains, low wheat, and weak spices. After taste is like soaked grains. What happened!? this used to be one of my favorite brews, I used to drink it almost weekly. Now, I dont know if I will be drinking this one any more. There are much better wheat beers out there.

Good amount of carbonation present, lots of tiny bubbles rising in the haze.  I do believe I see yeast chunks floating, then settling at the bottom.  I wasnt aware that this is bottle conditioned.  Aroma is a classic note of citrus and spice.  1st sip is a tangy note of orange & lemon peel, spicy coriander, and biscuity yeast!  Crisp and very refreshing!

Drinkability is very high...even with the higher alcohol content, I could see myself easily downing one after the other on a hot summer day.

Why  increase the gravity of a brew thats chief strength is that its a summertime thirst quencher?  It pours cloudy golden orange but maybe not quite cloudy enough for the style--and I poured in every last drop from the bottle--w/ a small head that fades fast and is made of large mixed sized bubbles to begin w/. To be completely earnest, there is nothing about the appearance of this beer that makes me want to drink it. The nose, on the other hand, does well enough in its own mild way. A bit of banana and clove yeast character dance around some bright orange peel notes. The alcohol is noticeable which I feel is a pretty big negative on a beer thats in this strength range but it tastes decent otherwise. Mouthfeel is light and lacking in the thick wheaty, soft carbonated texture in the best of the style. This is just one of those beers that theres nothing really wrong w/ thats just not really good.

4605,"2010-04-20",4.4,"A- Uniform hazy yellow body with thin foamy white head. Head eventually fades and leaves behind little lacing in the glass. The translucent cloudy body is well done and shows that the brew is unfiltered.

S- Slightly sour citrus with accents of yeast, coriander, and other spices.

T- Great balance of wheat, sour citrus, and spices upfront. Some hoppiness then kicks in with yeast and spice. Yeast and sour citrus linger on the palate.

P- Light yeasty body and medium carbonation. Goes down easy.

O- I was really excited to finally get to try this brew. Its delicious-but a bit on the sour side for a witbier. The ABV is completely masked here-it tastes like a normal session ale. I will have this one again.

4605,"2010-02-09",4.0,"Poured from a 12oz bottle, the color is a golden/pale yellow. Aroma is a mix of citrus and lemongrass. Appearance is pretty common, with a head that diminishes quickly but the carbonation bubbles leave it active the entire time drinking it.  In taste, it hits you with a medium sweetness and a light sourness at the end of each sip. The beer itself is medium to light with a slight oily texture and with an overall average carbonation  and slight astringent finish. Overall, for it currently being in the top 10 (as of this review) of the Witbier it was good and actually is a bit more complex then most and strays to slight variations in ingredients which give the beer its own uniqueness. The use of the Curacao orange peel is what sets it apart (in my own opinion) with the fact that the oranges already have a heavy sour bitterness that even standard bitter oranges rarely match.","Delaware, USA","geofbaum"

I really hate to do this because I probably got a bad bottle... but here goes.  12 oz bottle which poured with no head.

4605,"2009-08-04",3.7,"Wit beers are an equal favorite for me in comparison to German Weise/Hefeweizen beers. As a beer style, they are incongruous with summer, sunshine, warm weather, and thirst quenching session beers. No beer style better represents thirst-quenching refreshment better than a Belgian Wit or German Hefe. The folks at Southampton Publick House know this and have crafted the Double Wit, a Belgian Wit that rivals Hooegarden in its richer spiced approach loaded with mouth-watering refreshment.


Cloudy, hazy, and crowned with a soft tuft of white foam which lingers as a thick blanket. Her colors are blanched hay and straw with a soft white haze floating about her person. Nothing could hold her nose back as wave after wave of mouth-watering coriander; clove, bananas and cream, lemon zest, kiwi, and kneading dough fill my senses. A wisp of hay, barnyard dust, and saddlebags linger in the background. I could smell her nose all day long, but then I would be missing out on what lingers below. Thick, full, and chewy with soft bread dough and a puree of bananas, cream, clove, coriander, and orange peel glide effortlessly over my tastebuds. Lemon zest lingers in my breath which compliments her light finish. She is rich and full up front and in the middle, but fades softly into her finish for a balance that is highly refreshing and thirst-quenching. A bit more banana than I was expecting for a Belgian Wit, but she is a double wit and when one keeps in mind the flavor-explosion that is Hooegarden, one can see the parallels. A faint dryness starts to grow, hinting of bailed hay, barnyard dust, and saddlebags, but then her spiced, creamy banana and zesty palate kicks it into high gear once more. It must have been on the warmer side in my apartment because my Double Wit is long gone; all that lingers are tantalizing clumps of puffy white lace and foam.


Rich, expressive, exciting, packed with flavor, and still super easy to drink. A winner on all accounts in my book. Up until recently, I had only heard of the classic quality and skills that went into Southamptons special beers, but now I understand. Their Double Wit could have been too much double of everything, but instead, an amazing balance was achieved and I found another great thirst-quencher to get me through the long, hot Florida summer months.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Fairly lively carbonation and virtually no thickness to the liquid. Looks light. Wow that a really nice spiciness that comes from what I imagine is the huge amounts of actual spice. Mixed with coriander and orange zest and lemon zest. Some clove and a nice hint of alcohol. Taste or orange and lemon with a huge amount of coriander and spice that stick though the whole beer. Some definite clove and even a touch of honey. The lively carbonation gives the illusion of a fuller beer than this is. Still it’s a very flavorful beer whose intention are fulfilled in being absolutely delicious. This beer is not only great on a hot day, it’s also great with any spicy food. Chinese, BBQ, Thai and even Buffalo chicken. This is an all around winner in my book! This beer is quiet drinkable and should be enjoyed all summer long, with friends and great food.

4605,"2008-10-26",4.0,"12oz bottle. Pours opaque cloudy yellow/straw with medium white head. The aroma is like an herbal citrus tea: floral, lemongrass, touch of honey. The flavor has a mild residual sweetness that is delicate but notable and delicious. The flavor has lots of wheat and biscuit notes and a dry flour impression from flaked unmalted grains. There is an interesting floral quality to the ester profile. The finish is refreshing and somewhat sweet with a mild honey sweetness. Lemon zest and coriander are present throughout at medium intensity. The floral and sweet qualities are somewhat reminiscent of Unibroue’s Blanc de Chamblee (just somewhat). The mouthfeel is creamy with a full body. There are lots of suds but the crisp bubbles aren’t too much and don’t provide sting to the tongue - just right. Overall, this is a beautiful witbier. The strength is great enough for the beer to be obviously a double - but it provides enough extra punch to be more flavorful and delectable than most typical-strength witbiers.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Flavour is very citrusy, with some spice in the middle, and a little bit of alcohol warmth, but not too much.  Theres another flavour in there that might be the corriander, its kind of salt and pepper-ish, but Im really not sure.  Theres not a whole lot of hops, either flavour or bitterness.  Carbonation is pretty high, but not offensive, and mouthfeel is nice, not too watery, but not too thick either.  Pretty refreshing.","St. Johns, Newfoundland, CANADA","mullet2007"

Good quality grain in the nose as well.  Lemony and orange flavours are the main ones that are present, and there is also a candy sweetness from the yeast.  Sort of like red licorice.

Pours a cloudy light-straw color, a bit of floating matter, with an attractive fluffy white head. Interesting aroma: slightly sour, lemon; grassy, some alcohol, lots of orange peel and coriander. The flavor kicks in hard: its got a powerful puckering dryness that comes on with a syrup-like intensity, big orange-peel flavor, much more bitter than other examples of the style, again that alcohol making itself known, lemon, coriander notable mostly late, with banana juice coming on strong at the same time. 

Certainly an interesting beer and one that Im very pleased to have tried.

4605,"2008-03-05",4.0,"Pours pale, cloudy, light gold. A moderate, dense white head rose to an inch upon pouring, and receded to a skim coat, followed by a few mere whisps of bubble threads on the surface. Some subtle lacework was evident at first, but dissapated after a few sips. 
Aromatics are spicy, zesty, and fruity. Lemon zest and coriander take the lead, with notes of wet straw, cracked cumin, and mint follow through. 
Mouthfeel is a quenching balance of crispiness and creamyness. Carbonation is medium and slightly spritzy. 
The pallet is filled with citric twang, balanced spicing, and an earthy dryness. Lemon overtones layered on orange zest, white pepper, spearmint, and a slight citic bite of corainder. A yeasty, almost funky follow-through adds some nice depth and complexity. 
A more substantial grain bill and alcohol level keeps this double white from being watery. 
Finishes drying, slightly warming, and approachable for the next sip.

Pale yellow with medium long lasting lacing. Aroma dominated by oranges and quite simple also some weak and not very nice notes of stable. Taste again dominated wih oranges and quite alcoholdominated. This beer is far away from the best belgium witbiers. It´s lacking the complexity of Hoegarden both in aroma and taste.

The aroma displays heavy coriander, citrus blossoms, wheat, sweet orange, and floral hops.  The flavor follows suit, but the floral intensity increases significantly.  Coriander also seems overly concentrated, and citric acid adds an out-of-place sour, harsh element.  Imperial Wit is a fitting description for this brew.  Medium bodied and slightly cloying.

4605,"2007-11-12",3.4,"Compared to other witbiers Ive had, Im not sure this one is really ""big"" enough to be called a ""double wit.""  The only other beer in recent memory that wore that title was the Real Ale Limestone Wit, which somehow seemed fresher, more citrus-y, and spicier than this example.  However, it was quite a nice witbier, especially for American examples of this style, which can be over-sweet for my liking.

Appearance was a slightly hazy lemonade color with a good amount of soft white head.  Aroma was rather citrus-y, and definitely spicy.  Flavor was mostly clove, with some coriander and a nice amount of citrus.  Flavor was pleasant, but not over-stated.  Mouthfeel was pretty unremarkable, but not bad.

As advertised, it smelled like a wit mostly. I say mostly, because in addition to the typical coriander, orange, and fresh bread dough, there was also a subtle meaty note. Almost like salami or bologna. Hmmm, maybe its just me. Dry and slightly chalky on the tongue. Carbonation was on the champaign end of the spectrum, so prickly bubbles hit the tongue first followed by orange and coriander flavors. There was only the faintest hint of the 6.8% alcohol in the flavor. Pretty good beer.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"

Theres plum skin, puckering pear nectar, gentle orange blossom, jasmine rice and a strong whack of sour orange peel. Great character. Even the coriander plays clean. So, do the yeast. None of that coarse, rubbery phenol action. Just a gentle infusion of soft, low mineral notes. Light breadiness and rich texture. Alcohols brings a level of depth to this beer. It really came across a ""single"" Wit, with a bit more chewiness. It retains excellent quaffable aloofness and gentle, yet refined character.

Pours a clear pale yellow with a two finger head that fades slowly to a nice solid cap. The lacing is thick, leaving a nice sheeting of foam behind.

Smell; oranges and lemons are by far the dominant aromas, but theres also a underlying sweet maltiness. The spices are a little on the tame side, but that works just fine for me as I sometimes have a hard time with overly spiced beers.

Taste; mild coriander and peppery spiciness, followed quickly by orange peel and lemon, but theres also a little bit of peaches as well. Its a little tart through the middle, and then becomes just a little sweet towards the finish The wheat is actually very noticeable in flavor, and adds a nice depth to this beer that I dont usually get in a Wit.

Mouthfeel is a bit sharp right initially, but then becomes quite a bit smoother with a fine carbonation that gives a creamy texture. Very nice. The drinkability is really damn good, and the alcohol is barely detectable.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a cloudy, medium to dark yellow, depending on the width of the glass, with tons and tons and tons of carbonation and a small to average-sized , white head that fully lasted. The lacing was good, but not in a traditional sense. It was almost like Brussles wool or cotton. It was spotty but thick in spots. The aroma was moderately yeasty with wheat, spices and some banana. The flavor was mostly moderately sweet with some acid and sourness and the finish had an average duration. The flavor was lemon and wheat with a little yeast and a touch of banana too.

This is my first encounter with Southampton. Poured a lightly cloudy straw golden. Theres a huge amount of carbonation rising like a tornado from the bottom of my pilsner glass. The head, when poured, was 1+ finger of rocky airy goodness but quickly faded to a light cap. The carbonation is unstoppable. Leaves some airy lacing after each drink that slowly falls back into the body. 

I really like a good white ale when Im in the mood. So the idea of a double white really interested me. I really wasnt sure what to expect. The nose really sends home what this beer is supposed to be. It has all the white aromas but they are much bigger than usual. When I first opened the bottle all I melled was orange. After the pour lemon took over. Starts off dusty. Then comes a generous squeeze of lemon. Big coriander and if you smell deep the lemon that was there at the beginning. After all this you get a solid dose of spicy yeast and a pinch of white pepper. 

The flavor is very much the same as the smell. Again, being a double white, the flavors are a lot bigger than traditional whites. Theres a splash of lemon to start things off along with some coriander. There may be a little too much coriander. Mid-palate the spiciness of the yeast and the white pepper show up and finish things off with the oriander in the background. I said there is too much coriander but thats just me finding a fault. Its a very good flavorful beer.

The mouthfeel fits this beer really well. The body is light and refreshing. The huge amount of carbonation is surprisingly soft on the tongue but does wake up the tastebuds with a stimulating tingle. 

The drinkability is good. Im drinking this now and its winter. Im not getting the full refreshing, thirst quenching expierence that I would if it was hotter outside but I can only imagine how good this would be to drink on a hot 90+ summer day. One bomber is enough for now but Id be good with a cooler of these in the summer.

This is an excellent beer from Southampton and as exciting as a white ale can get. Im glad I got my hands on this one and Im looking forward to trying some of their other beers in the near future.

The color is almost an ethereal golden honey... Ive never seen quite this color in a beer before.  Has good depth and classic Belgian Wit flavors, but, at the same time, a bit delicate;  ""Double"" in this case is only an indicator of alcoholic strength, and nothing else.  Definately a good wit...

Looks good, yeast particles mysteriously spinning around if poured properly.  Pop the lid for a yeasty beer aroma with alky citrus background hints.  Good hefe wheat like taste but stronger as far as alky goes, compared to a gentleman wit.  More like a hefe not wit.  White wheat beer flavor is strong.  Good  creamy carbonation fizz on the throat. Some medium building bitterness does seem to come across on the finish.  A little more offensive personality than I am used to with a mild wit. Overall, good but may not be easily repeatable considering the high alky personality.    I think this may be below the average of wits flavors that I have tasted, however, those who like high alky brews will appreciate this representation of the style.

Flavor is much the same Yeast all the way with the orange being pretty subdued and the coriander coming through more. Then it takes a turn for the worst I think the wheat takes over and kills it being sour, irony and just not tasting good, that mixed with orange and coriander just isnt helping followed by a pepper bite in the back.

Aroma of fresh orange slices, some yeast, some spicy peppery hops, coriander.  When I first popped the cork I thought that this was fairly oaky and sour, but upon pouring I just got some tartness.  Flavor has lots of yeast and spice to go along with the lemon tang and sweetish oranges.  Coriander is also present.  It almost has the cloying sweet flavor of some Belgians and saisons that I cant hardly stand, but not quite.  Semidry finish.  Moderate carbonation, light body.

Aromas at first are mixed peppery/clove spice, medium light coriander, and lots of wheat malt.  Im not getting the orange peel at all in the aroma.  Also a bit of a pils malt aroma. Yeast adds a bit of bready character, and has a hint, just a hint, of banana in the aroma followed by whisps of sulphury yeast.  The flavor is well balanced and has just that hint of tartness that the classics have.  Also a bready wheat character w/ some coriander flavor along with a bit of alcoholic estery flavor @ the finish.  Again, the orange seems absent.  Finishes on the dry side w/ a wheat malt flavor and a bit of spicy yeast.   There is just a bit of herbal hop in the aftertaste that lingers with the wheat malt.   The body is light medium, carbonation is light high medium, no alcohol present in the mouth.   Not a bad beer, but Id like to see more of the orange peel come through in at least the aroma.   Ill agree that it would be oddly refreshing @ 6.8 ABV and it does have nice flavors.  I actually enjoy this one pretty much!  Not a classic, but good nonetheless!","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"
4605,"2007-01-21",3.3,"Deceptively light is right. Poured cloudy straw colored with white creamy hues. I guess that sounds gross, but it looked okay. Aroma is coriander and substandard wheat malt. Flavor improves quite a bit, with tastes of wheat, citrus fruits, bread and light banana. Really not of the caliber of SPH beer that is made at the brewpub, but very easy to drink and refreshing. Finishes light and without a crisp wind up, just a lot of yeast. Thats alright, I enjoy a different take on a style that seems all too similar way too often. The light touch to a higher octane beer is certainly a result of a better than average recipe, or ingredients, or both.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

4605,"2006-11-29",3.9,"The witbier, my secret pleasure - a style so simple, a duality of flavors, refreshing year round and available almost anywhere thanks to the machine Hoegaarden has become. Indeed every wit Ive had is itself merely by comparison to Hoegaarden, regardless of the ""descent"" (to put it euphemiously). When I finally found a beer that could transcend the delicate balance of Hoegaarden, namely Abbaye des Rocs double white, I felt somewhat cheated by the strong Tripel connotations it held for me, and while I enjoyed the brew, I felt that reaching the pinnacle of this style could be better done by remaining confined to its limitations. Des Rocs creative approach, though delicious, simply doesnt feel witty enough, and here I mean both clever and wit-like. Enter Southampton, a sphinx among brewers, suddenly producing one of the truest Belgians outside of Belgium (in the form of Grand Cru) and, to me, esoteric as can be. This interpretation glows of a bright buttery hue and shines with a smooth opalescent top that erodes to an even sheet of lace. Lemon curd appears upon the nose, reconciling the sharp citrus with a buttery softness. Nutmeg and of course coriander appear prominently while hints of pineapple and artichoke heart add to the succinct but balanced complexity of the aroma. Orange peel, coriander as well as the slight sourness of pineapple and apple create a depth and character that is true to the style but enhanced and veritably made double. The palate is adorned by the very authentic hint of chalk and a dry but refreshing burst of fine carbonation. Southampton has nailed the style perfectly and taken it to the next logical level with a sophisticated allure, while retaining the primordial quenching quality of the wit. Bravo!","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

4605,"2006-10-09",3.5,"This is one of the early 2006 bottles that was recalled due to there being too much crystal malt in the mix...  Light amber color (maybe deep golden), slightly hazy.  Moderate carbonation with a foamy ivory head that bubbles away rapidly.  The residual crown leaves some lacing.  Aroma is wheat malt, yeast, corriander and clove, banana, and bitter orange.  Flavor is a little sour  and peppery with undertones of wheat, alcohol, hops, and citrus.  Finish is a little dry and bitter with a hint of tart lemon.  Medium body and fairly smooth.  The alcohol is well integrated.  This is a welcomed derivation from ""the usual"" white beer.  The flavor seems to be more complex and sour, but not really reminiscent of a traditional white beer in any way except for the aroma...

4605,"2006-09-30",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2007 My first Witbier at the Great American Beer Festival came from Southampton: the Double White Ale.  Prior to the festival I found it difficult to find shades of variety between one Witbier and another.  I started by using Hoegaarden as a comparative base by simple virtue of being my first Witbier.  From there I made special efforts to dissect other white beers with meticulous attention to detail.  Even these precautions and preparations failed to make it a successful tasting venture.  But a little side by side sipping at the GABF has mostly corrected this, beginning with this distinguishingly unique Wit.  Its colored like any other wit  faded marigold yellow, clouded with fog and topped with a nebulous white head.  The smell is the first indicator that this Southampton take on a popular style is just a bit outré.  All the given components of a good white beer are there: popcorn, wheat, yeast, butter and a hint of lemon.  Alongside these is a challenging smell to describe.  It reminded me of odiferous pulp, the kind of effusive smell that comes from wet paper towels or napkins.  Stemming from this came a slightly dusty smell, not unpleasant, but like the particulate dirt in a museum.  The taste is another step more creative.  Its definitively based on the typical Wit taste, but with a welcome dimension of sour and tartness, like a lambic.  Added to this is a pronounced element of lemon, spice, clove and an encompassing tanginess.  Its much more exciting then any duller witbier on account of the sour cascade, but makes a sudden departure from tradition in doing so.  I cant really decide if its superior or inferior to, say, a plainer white beer.  As a more complex beer it is better, but the tongue rippling twang makes it an entirely different breed.  Nonetheless, it is a welcome change and all the flavors work together for an eye opening drink  It is a new twist on a plain beer that I liked, and more importantly, a tangible disparity between itself and other Wits.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

4605,"2006-06-24",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2007 750 ml cork & wire (same as picture), 2005 bottle.  I really make a big distinction between this and the 22oz bomber.  Bottle has a lot of sediment on the bottom.  Poured into wine glass (keeping the sediment out so far), color is a deep yellow with orange-ish tints.  Small head.  Cannot see through the beer.   Its actually a beautiful color, can see the bubbles running on the side of the glass.  Allows just enough translucence.  The head isnt big but definitely makes the beer more attractive.  Aroma is very present - its a heavier aroma than most Wits.  Definitely full of citrus but not zingy or lemony but more orange-citrus.  Taste is also orange-like citrus.  More muted than expected.  Actually, the taste is a bit of a let down.  Now poured with the yeast, adds a bit of a sour apple taste but still a let down, too muted.8/4/6/3/14.Rerate: 12 oz bottle, this is the new Double White and pretty much nothing like the old.  This was bottled no more than just 3 months ago, if not fresher.  Before this it was produced in bombers.  This really is a different beast and a much better beer. Now I know this goes against the popular opinion (b/c these are made at Saratoga Springs).  Pours with a medium head and a sticky lacing into my tulip glass.  Color is a glowing, murky, pale yellow.  Medium clarity and just radiant.  Aroma is great, starts with refreshing wheat tartiness and lemon with lime and a fragrant flowery citusness all around. Then there is still a cookie dough maltiness that I can pick up in there.  Taste is similar with the lemon and tartiness.  Body is light medium but a lemon flavor with a nice carbonation makes it so damn easy to go down and so quaffable.  Finishes with a lemon zing, low bitterness and a light biscuit heft to round it all out.

4605,"2005-10-04",2.6,"I get it ... this is supposed to be another Golden Monkey.  But it does not quite work ...  Hazy gold with almost no head, and a dead mouthfeel that underscores the lack of carbonation.  Slightly off nose.  Taste of wheat and bread, orange, hops, and a bitter finish with good lemon citrus.  Somehow the appearance of the Monkey, the mouth of the Monkey, and the nose of the Monkey are all vastly superior.  The taste of the two is different, and I prefer the sweeter, stronger wheat and malt taste of the Monkey, but there is less reason to pick an obvious favorite on taste.  On the other dimensions the Monkey wins paws down.   Im surprised that my rating comes in so close to the bottom ... maybe the bottle I had did not travel happily to Pennsylvania.

Its stronger than the Hoegaarden, but not as overdone as the Allagash.

Starts off extremely clear, light gold  though the second addition of fluid yields a hazy/fuzzy body.  Rich, fruity, spicy aromatics: buttered lemon rinds; soft, elegant yeast, melted bananas, and luscious pears.  A velvety blanket of carbonation entices the soul and sooths the taste buds just in time for them to realize the wonders that surround: tart, green apple pie with a wonderful doughy crust, caramelized banana ice cream, and a dusting or coriander.

Aroma surprises at first with its citric and lactic side. This is as zesty as it gets, lime like, passion fruits, spicy ginger, coriander. Very subtle alcohol, cream hints. Nice smell for a wit. Im taken aback by the first sip though. It is quite acid.. once again lactic and citric, this time a bit more in an orangey citrusy way, but it gives the impression to be a yeast affair and doesnt appear like the logical following to the beautiful aroma. Carbonation level is very high, yet its rather smooth and medium bodied. Not as full as a blanche neige or as spicy/weird as a kiuchi to me among my top witbiers, but Ill revisit soon enough to study into this sourness further.

4605,"2004-09-12",4.4,"POP!, goes the cork, and away we pour....cloudy golden hue, beneath a majestic helping of snowy froth, leisurely collapsing to a more modest dimension.
Nose perfectly captures the soul of the wit, the light, breezy nature, mixed with delicate spice, and accompanying citric zest vapors. Easily matches the uplifting aromas of the very best witbiers Ive ever known.
Tangy tartness starts off the taste, giving a cause to pucker and sliding lemony flavor down the tongue. It returns with each additional congress between cup and lip, and each time delivers a serious, even juicy, blast of flavor. Still, lightness remains, and refreshment is the order of the day. Light in body, but with a long, fruity finish, and a uncompromising commitment to flavor. I admire more and more the insistence of the citric feel on the tongue and back down the throat the further I get into this full-size bottle, and the spices are better regarded too, the more I partake. 
Other whites/wits Ive had deliver, then peter out, but not this one, it stays strong from the start and never quits. The flavor is almost palpable, and urges every sip onward. (I had an undesired ale before this, and relish the act of enjoying every taste, rather than plodding through an unexceptionable bore of a beer.)
Magnificent, really. Wish I had more than the one sample, (thanks to sulldaddy!), so I could share among others at picnics, park benches, drive-in movies, motorcycle rallies, kite-flying expeditions, Crimean War re-enactments, Klingon weddings, voodoo ceremonies, hammock testings, effigy burnings...any time really...good beer, perfect for good people, wherever they may be found.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
4605,"2004-08-28",4.0,"The beer arrived in a 750 ml greenish brown, champagne style bottle with a wire cage and a cork. The beer was included in the BIF 10 box by Lupe of beeradvocate. The cork was quite tight and when pulled out, gave a nice and loud pop. The body was pale yellow in color with some yeast induced cloudiness. The head was quite small in size due to my intitial gentle pour, although a steady stream of bubbles did stay around the entire session. My second pour was more aggressive, and a nice head did fomr at first, but it was not very lasting.  The aroma was very musty and earthy at first, but as the beer breathed fresh air, the fruity scents of banana and orange, and some floral notes came more to the forefront. The taste was delicately light with a lemony, zesty flavor that was perfectly enhanced by spices that tasted like ginger, pepper, and coriander. The alcohol content was very deceptively hidden, and did not get in the way of the refreshing nature of the beer at all. The mouthfeel was light, and just a touch creamy. The aftertaste was dry and warm, thanks to the alcohol and the spices. This 2004 edition is a most delicious take on the style.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

It finishes with an appealing acidic tartness, which is a great foil for the flavors that are in the front of this beer.  There is a definite lemony/ orange character, and it is joined by a light coriander note.  The carbonation reinforces the invigorating zing that is found in the finish.The acidity in this is quite wonderful, nothing like a Lambic or a Flemish Sour, but it is here, and it is quite welcome.
