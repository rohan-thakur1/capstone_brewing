Taste was of light gass hops, toast malts and some straw. One of the better Malt Liquors i have had. I love the Name aswell.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"

2980,"2009-09-14",3.3,"4oz sample at brewery - Aroma of sweet pale malts and straw.  A little something else there that isnt very appealing.  Flavor is actually very nice.  Hops start before the sweet pale malts and straw kick in.  The best Malt Liquor Ive had","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","MI2CA"
2980,"2009-09-08",3.1,"Heavy ale because its malt liquor. So big heavy sweet notes of alcohol in an ale style that otherwise is light, unassuming, and just slightly hopped and malted. Not too bad though.","Portland, Oregon, USA","stchloe"
2980,"2009-02-27",3.0,"Tasted off the fermenter @ the brewery.  I think this is kind of a novelty brew.  Its drinkable but not my style.","Freeport, Georgia, USA","jimbowood"
2980,"2007-06-18",3.2,"Had this at Brouwers a while back. From what I remember it was mostly sweet malt with fruitiness and some grain. Poured an orange  color. Flavor was mostly sweet. I remember it being sweet, fruity, and pretty heavy. Alcohol notes come through as well. I want to try this one again most definitley.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2980,"2007-02-11",3.3,"Tap @ übertavern: Golden color of course, light head and lacing. Fruity nose with nice clean hops and malt. A clean flavor too with some toasty malts and lightly grassy hops. Overall its not that strong, but it has the traditional baltic type malt liquor notes but delivered in a much cleaner fashion.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
2980,"2007-01-14",2.6,"Light amber with a foamy head and good lace. Sweet, sweet malts. Fruity aromas with a ton of alcohol. Lots of candy like sweetness comes out in the flavor. A bit much. Foral or piney hops. Thick and chewy with a strong finish of sweet fruits.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"
2980,"2006-07-25",3.0,"Very clean for a malt liquor-no strange chemical taste or aroma, no alcohol burn, no sweet beyond suga. But in getting so clean not much is left. Draft at Horse Brass was a little flat, & more carbonation is needed. Unexpected thickness in mouthfeel. Back taste of honey, somewhat dubbel-ish. definitely better than Rogues malt liquor.","Portland, Oregon, USA","raphael"
2980,"2006-07-06",2.7,"On Tap at the brewpub.  At last something that satisfies my requirement for te style.  Pale slightly hazy yellow with a wispy white head.  Aroma is rather grainy and the the flavor is of very light pale malts and a slight alcohol bite.","Boise, Idaho, USA","IndianaRed"
2980,"2006-06-28",2.8,"UPDATED: JUN 29, 2006 On tap at the Barking Dog in Seattle.
Pours corn-yellow with a modes white head. The aroma is sweet, with an almost fruity aroma and a hint of hops. The flavor is rather corn-heavy, again rather sweet, astringently alcoholic on the taste. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy
. The beer is passable enough, all things (i.e., the syle) considered, though its certainly not going to be a regular selection for me.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2980,"2006-06-19",2.2,"Hmm, this trend of malt liquors is getting out of hand, but somehow im crazy enough to keep trying them, and continue to get the same results. Very strong beers, with nothing exciting. Im not sure why they make these, it seems like you have nothing to win, even if you make a great one, its still malt liqour and still doesnt taste good, but i guess if they are just tryin to stick it to OE or King Cobra, they have succeeded, booyah! our malt liquor is better!","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
2980,"2006-06-18",3.1,"[Tap  Fathers Day Brewery Tour 06]
Schlitz has nothing on this beer.  This was a great easy drinking beer.  A good yellow color and a strong malt background.  The beer was easy to drink and would be perfect for the college crowds.","Olympia, Washington, USA","BrewDad"
2980,"2006-05-28",2.2,"Gold. Thin head. Tastes like malt liquor so I guess they succeeded. Whoopee.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
2980,"2006-05-19",3.4,"Tap at brewery.  Medium golden colored and clear.  Fast fading white head and moderate lacing.  Sweet malty aroma, perhaps some corn?  Medium bodied, a bit alcoholic towards the finish with just a hint of that special burn that lets you know this is truly a malt liquor.  Sweet flavors with a hint of corn.  Decently done, along with the Hawks malt liquor this stands out as a good sample of a rather hideous style.","Alabama, USA","11026"
2980,"2006-05-14",2.9,"Clear, ture on true golden coloring, with a small frothy white head.  Fruity aroma, with some sweetness in the flavor, very well balanced, and very good for the style and what they were trying to make.  Perfumey hops, sweets malts, with some albeit adjuncts.  Decent.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","harlequinn"
