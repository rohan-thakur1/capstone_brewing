I knew going into this that this was almost certainly well past its best-by date, and I wasnt wrong. However, since I have a fresh example of the same style in my cellar now (a DeuS Brut des Flandres) I thought it might be interesting to see how they age. In case youre wondering, the answer is not well. I get hints of what this should be, I think, but unfortunately it isnt, any more. Ill definitely try it again if I can find it fresher.

2349,"2015-01-01",3.5,"2010 750ml bottle, sent to me by jtclockwork - thanks! Pours cloudy gold-orange with white head, decent retention. Aroma: cardboard, banana laffy taffy, citrus, some cotton candy, and some special blend of herbs and spices. Taste is surprisingly sweet -- like candied orange peel spiked with Laffy Taffy. Fruity, minimally bitter finish; sweet residue lingers in the mouth. Palate: medium body, average carbonation. Overall: I had high hopes for this, and even saved it for New Years. This bottle is almost certainly past its prime, but shows glimmers of what was probably a very nice beer a few years ago.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

Spicy nose of cloves, white pepper, and black peppercorns, along with some bright notes of caramel and floral notes, but those are a bit more subdued. Fizzy, assertive medium body, very present and very charming. Floral, herbal, grassy, caramel, and spicy notes on the mid-palate. Much going on.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2349,"2011-01-07",4.4,"Pours golden with a more-than-3-fingers head. Very bubbly, but micro-bubbles, so its very pleasant. Spicy and orangy. Medium body. Theres a little sweet edge at the end with an herbal hop finish. VERY nice.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
2349,"2011-01-02",3.6,"Bouteille de 750 ml, pour fêter larrivée de 2011. Arômes de levure fruitée et épicée (agrumes). Légère présence dun houblon herbacé. Robe dorée et limpide, très belle mousse et effervescence champenoise (cest très bien réussi à ce niveau!). En bouche, la bière montre une belle base maltée mielleuse, moyennement sucrée. La levure et les épices apportent des notes rappelant lécorce dorange. Lalcool contribue une touche réchauffante en finale. Une bonne bière, idéale pour partager avec des invités lors dune occasion spéciale.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MJGG"
2349,"2010-12-31",4.0,"Fantastic looking beer, pours a golden yellow with a generous foamy white head and lots of carbonation.  Aroma is cereal and grain.  Taste is very much like a champagne, lots of great carbonation that tickles the palate.  Very dry and the taste of dusty grain lingers.  Great beer!!","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","cfrancis"
2349,"2010-10-12",4.7,"best champenoise ever! They bought some machine from france to turn over the bottles like the real champagne!!! It makes foams like champagne and it is just perfect..... Congratulation!","Quebec, CANADA","frankyjus5000"
2349,"2010-09-18",3.7,"Bottle. Blond pour with a huge white and solid foam. Aroma is quite discrete with tropical fruits  (mostly pears with some peaches and pinneaples), some yeast bananas and cereal. Taste is sadly more leaning toward tropical fruits than belgium yeast. Appropriate carbonation but the palate is unfortunately too liquorous for the style. You can feel the alcohol presence. Still a very good beer but with a steep retail price (25$), I was expecting better. I guess I prefer a cleaner version of the style such as Malheur Brut.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2349,"2010-08-29",4.2,"Poured from a 750ml bottle, cork, bought at Grand Duc, (price...very expensive), drank from a Orval calice. Nice golden colour, with thin head. Apricot and spices aroma. Very tasty, powerfull, spices, very long aftertaste, very good warming beer. 8/10","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","rodenbach99"
2349,"2010-08-12",4.0,"Bottle: Poured a bright golden color ale with a large foamy head with excellent retention and some very nice lacing. Aroma is a mix between some light warming alcohol notes with sweet candy-like notes and some spicy notes also noticeable. Taste is also a nice enough mix between some sweet candy like malt notes mix with some spicy peppery yeast notes and some light warming alcohol. Easily drinkable though different then Champagne. Maybe a tad too sweet too drink too much by myself but very nice nonetheless.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
2349,"2010-08-06",3.9,"In short: A crisp and very lively champagne beer.  Excellent.
How: Generous double-size sample at Montreal Mondial de la Bière 2010
The look: Clear blonde body topped by a medium white head with medium retention
In long: Nice scented nose with champagne on a bed of grass and dead flowers.  Taste is very crisp and bright.  Bready malts.  Rather fruity with light color fruits (pineapples, pears, apples, etc.) that at times feel like fresh fruits and at times dried fruits.  Spicy notes here and there.  Nice hopping with a wet grass character.  I personally could have used more hops in this one.  Superb mouthfeel with an super-lively carbonation.  This is no Malheur Brut but it is certainly the second best example of this all-too-rare style of champagne beer.  Id like to buy many bottles of this but they did not produce enough of it.  To let us taste this excellent beer at local beer festival and then tell us that we cant buy bottles is evil.  This is more evil than the dude at Barnes & Noble who puts the books on back pain on the bottom shelf.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2349,"2010-07-19",3.6,"Deep golden color. Very carbonated, rocky head. Heavily spiced with orange peel, ginger and cardamon. Somewhat minerally. Highly carbonated mouth, full bodied with ginger and oranges standing out. Not as well balanced or as dry, as I hoped. Moderately bitter finish. Decent, but not outstanding.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
2349,"2010-07-12",4.2,"Half a bottle for me! Cork popped right into my hand when I touched it! Golden amber with a very thick white head. First partial glass had big bubbles while second pour had a thick creamy head. A constant of rush of tiny bubbles rising to the surface. Moderate spice scent; hops, grass and pepper. Flavour has a surprising sweetness, a bit more earthiness than Deus or Malheur, notes of alcohol, a bit of pepper and hops and a hint of anise seed.Body is a little fuller and creamier than expected. ABV is impossible to guess at from the taste as it is hidden so well.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"

2349,"2010-06-08",3.8,"Mondial 2010 bottle.  Pours a nice sparkling light golden, clear with a fading big white head.  Aroma is spicy phenolic Belgian yeasty champagne like with big doughy malty and yeasty character with fruity pineapple hints and big on the tannic grapeskin.  Flavor is more fruity tannic skins, grape, and pineapple pulp with a dry doughy bready hint, fragrant and floral hops, lilac and slight lavender herbal kick with light grass and vege DMS in the end.  Mostly smooth and mostly dry finish- seemed a bit unrefined though compared to some other champenoise style beers.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

Aroma is banana, yeast, malt, cloves, spices, sugar, spices yeast and white fruits. Flavor is Very fruity with apples, watermelon, banana and pears with belgian malt and spices. Sweet.

Appearance : Clear yellow with a huge foamy head.

Aroma : Nice yeasty esters with crisp hops. Gets even fruitier as it heats up.

Taste : Wow this is good, very fruity with crisp hops and yeasty esters. A bit of alcohol and spices. A bit floral. Finish very fruity, rather dry and refreshing.

Overall : Wow this is so good. Very very fruity. nice esters. Highly drinkable. Cant wait to re-rate with a full bottle.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"
2349,"2010-06-02",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2011 My Bottom Line:
Coriander, star anise, grains of paradise and orange peel perfumes suffuse this Champenoise Beers fresh cereals, an intricate web of a profile which is made more salient by the prickly but peaceful effervescence.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam protects the clear blond.
-There are few examples of this style, but for references sake Id say this one is closer to Malheur Brut than Deus. But it has enough personality to stand on its own!
-A farmhouse touch seeps from the mildly bitter finish, tamed by alcohol heat.
-This is as elegant and polished as their Lupulus and Hibernus.
-The spiciness might become too much if you drink a whole bottle.

Bottles.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
