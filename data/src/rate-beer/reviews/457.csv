Palate - Soft carb, medium to full body, bitter roast but some dark sweet malts keep it in check, quite bitter overall, rich smooth roast. Finish as main flavour, long lingering considerably bitter roast with dark tarry malts, some more bitter hops coming thorough here but too over bitter in the finish 
Overall - Drinks with a complexity found in imperial stouts around 9-10%. Good stuff.","Near Carrick-on-Shannon, IRELAND","stravale"
457,"2013-11-22",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2014 Bottle. Pours black as oil and looks as viscous. No head at all really. Some large, mocha-colored bubbles on the sides. In the beginning the aroma is a lot of cocoa and by lot I mean a lot. It overpowers everything else. Maybe some roast, a tad of liquorice. But really, not much else besides the cocoa. Later on the liquorice and roast get stronger. After the aroma the taste is a surprise. A lot of roast and coffee, some liquorice, rather dry. A bit of hops in the finish: Grapefruit, citrus, a tad of wood. No cocoa or chocolate in sight. No carbonation at all really, maybe a little bit. Should have more definitely. Feels oily.","Alabama, USA","Erasmus_ro"
