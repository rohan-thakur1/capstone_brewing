2533,"2017-02-15",1.7,"330ml bottle - thanks Marduk!
Pale and hazy, brief tightish head. Fruity aroma, but some V8 veg, carrot and celery, eww, gets worse with every sip. Bland starchy pale malt taste, some celery herbal bitterness. Watery palate, but with some starchy fullness, and crisp carbonation. Finish is harshly dirty and bitter. If I was told I had to drink this after doing exercise, Id not do any exercise. Im pretty sure beers like this are why I avoid exercise. Bletch, but missing actual horror.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

2533,"2017-01-30",3.3,"Bottle at home. This is a serious contender for best non-alcoholic beer Ive tasted. I like the Nanny State but its basically an extremely well hopped, bodyless IPA. This doesnt feel like its impersonating a beer. Its got an interesting herbal, leafy note to it along with a wheaty body. A bit grassy. Its got a lot going for it and absolutely wasnt a chore to drink. Well played Mikkeller.","CZECH REPUBLIC","TheCametron"

PS: should this be even rateable? I thought drinks without any alcohol were not allowed?","Tallinn, ESTONIA","martjoobolut"
2533,"2016-11-11",3.2,"Bottle. Creamy White good mostly lasting head. Yellow colour. Light malty and heavy hoppy aroma. Strong citrus notes. Average moderate bitter flavor. Again some citrus notes. Average finish. Watery palate. According to rumors it is supposed to be fermented with a yeast that cannot make alcohol and is patented by Mikkeller.

2533,"2016-10-29",3.3,"330 ml. Bottle @ Gollem. Hazy orange, creamy white head. Nose mango & passionfruit USA hops mixed with mellow energy drink, light dash of Monster drink, slightly chalky, base artificial-like sweetness. Body is strange starchy mango puree, taste is dominated by this as well, weird chalky, coats your mouth, odd with pleasant mango & passion fruit but also long potato starch finish, low Monster drink profile, medium sweet. Mango & passion fruit notes are nice, body is odd, some strange qualities. Better than expected & very like much better when used as intended as opposed to in a bar setting. I doubt that many are ever going to use it as an sports drink given the come & go nature of Mikkellers offerings and the price point.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
