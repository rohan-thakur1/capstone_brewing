Pretty cloudy pale bright yellow beer, small creamy irregular white head, pretty stable, bit adhesive. Aroma: lots of citrus, some grapefruit, bit resinous. MF: ok carbon, medium body. Taste: pretty bitter, hoppy, citrus, bit grassy. Aftertaste: fruity, citrus, grapefruit, pretty bitter, dry, bit resinous. Decent, but not as good as the Three Magic Letters. ;-)","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"

Like a shy girl proclaiming her uncompromising love for you. Its nice.  The pour is neatly composed, and is a lightly peach orange color sitting subserviently underneath a soapy ghost white head, 1 finger in length. Lovely aromas of dried lavender, mint leaves, damp newspaper, American noble hops, hay, minerals, and a dash of low strength kilned tea leaves.  Not as resinous as I was hoping for: the flavors are of corn kernels, cotton balls, and LME, of course also possessing the same notes from its aroma on the taste as well. Though: Vague tea character actually hints more at Earl grey on its consumption. Very nearly perfect mouthfeel.

Aroma: The aroma is tropical fruit, some resiny notes, green tea, herbal notes, and a little pale malt

2087,"2015-06-28",3.3,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2015 Draught at Arsmby, 6/28/15Wonderfully effervescent light golden body is moderately hazy and topped by an endless amount of white head.Refreshingly citric and yet not too much so, with light lemon, sweet pils malts and soft pine suggestions all coming across quite homogenous in the nose. No alcohol, not surprisingly and no flaws, though a light touch of b vitamin. Surprisingly dry in the nose, for how sweet it becomes in the mouth, though perhaps the moderate doughiness helps see to that, as well as the playfully citric hoppiness. Touches of apricot and nectarine show through in the nose, as well.Pillowy, endlessly comforting malts with an absurdly soft, creamy carbonation provide for a perfect texture as meyer lemon, dry, unripe nectarine and forceful honey/sweet white dough-like maltiness vie for dominance. At first it seems balanced enough, but the relative lack of bitterness combined with the incredibly creamy mouthfeel seem to highlight the malts a bit too much. Quickly it grows overly sweet and bogs down the palate, with a heavily sweet sponge cake with icing-like flavor.  Had no idea there was tea in this.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2087,"2015-06-20",4.0,"On tap at Prohibition Pig.
This was poured into one of their half glasses.
The appearance was a pale hazy yellow color with a nice little concave white head that dissipated instantly. There was no lacing.
The smell started off with the sweet to semi-bitter citrus leading softly into a light floral setting and then the Earl gray tea shows just a bit of presence to soften further and show a wonderful balance altogether.
The taste was mildly refreshingly sweet with a pure light spice (guessing from the Centennial). The tea is there but settles in the back seat and allows a nice balance altogether. Theres no aftertaste but it had a wonderful quick semi-tea to sweet citrus finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a super nice sessionability about it.. Carbonation is mostly displaced by what Im guessing the Centennial and Amarillo hops to lead the charge on my tongue through the bitterness.

2087,"2014-12-17",4.1,"750ml growler in a tulip. Pours hazy golden with a white head. Aroma of floral and citrusy and lightly fruity hops, some pale malts, light notes of tea, and some light dough. Flavor the same with a great blend of the hops and the light beer. Average to lighter texture. A really good beer.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
2087,"2014-12-17",4.0,"2L growler pours cloudy pale straw yellow with medium head. Nose is punchy lemongrass, citrus, herbal hay, touch of dough. Palate is similar with some light fruity tea notes in the background, pleasant citrus and dry grain. Finish is dry lemon, grass, herb, grain, dough. Delightful.","Hampton Roads, Virginia, USA","JBPortland"
2087,"2014-12-14",4.0,"Pours a hazy pale straw yellow with a finger plus of white foam. On the nose is lots of hop character, tangerine, citrus pith, stale grass, soft rustic grain and a hint of sawdust. Palate follows with a gentle balance of soft hoppy citrus, wet straw, bitter grass, dusty earth, twigs and a lingering crushed stone.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
2087,"2014-12-05",3.9,"750 ml growler thanks to Willrunforbeer, much thanks! Hazy pale straw color, aroma is good amount of citrus, lemons and mango, was tea notes. Tones of straw. 
Floral and citrus notes. The tea is ver subtle and I couldnt pick it out if I didnt know it was here. Mild grassy and floral hops. The mouthfeel is light and effervescent. It also has that nice mineral water/ magic well water element to it. Very good low ABV brew with a crazy amount of flavors.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2087,"2014-12-04",4.2,"750 ML Growler filled at Hill Farmstead yesterday. Enjoyed in 2 stemware glasses @ 44 Degrees F. Had a sample at the brewery yet and I remember the mouthfeel being out of this world. 

A - Very soft, hazy light citrus juice color. It lacks the bright orange of Abner and appearance is close to Walden. 2 finger solid white head that fades to a small ring in the clean stemware.

S - Nose is a light mint, cedar chips, sourdough bread, dried bananas and an obvious citrus explosion with some pineapple and mango. Theres a lot in here. Obviously I smell tea but honestly its probably just power of suggestion as to why I smell that.

T - Well, never mind the taste itself is also very tea forward. the growler is nothing compared to what this tasted right out of the keg. Still, nice juiciness, some mineral qualities, tea and cream and and a very soft almost muted acidity like a watered down pineapple cream of some sort. 

M - Mouthfeel is outrageous. insanely soft and delicate, has a very similar mouthfeel to Walden and Society 5 and maybe the last batch of Amarillo for those keeping track at home.

O - This is an outrageous beer. Its a shame kegs arent available from Hill right now.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

2087,"2014-12-01",4.2,"Un nez juteux, très floral et un brin rustique nous amène vers un liquide typiquement Hill Farmstead. La structure céréalière est spectaculairement moelleuse et les feuilles de thés assèchent la langue en finale. Petite bombe de buvabilité.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"

Pours very hazy blond with medium white head. Intense lacing. Aroma is of citrus, tropical fruits, pine, some grain. Taste is of citrus, bitterness, tropical fruits, pine. Palate: Light-medium body.

2087,"2014-11-28",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2014 Growler shared by tom10101, many thanks! Pours a cloudy yellow with a small white head that leaves nice lacing. Nose is really fruity and orange-forward, really pleasing. Taste is of pine and oranges with some light tea and cereals in the background. A little tannic, it carries an impressive body for a 3.x % ABV brew. I would say it is medium bodied and carbonation is medium-high. Incredibly refreshing and drinkable. Really tasty too for a low alcohol option. Nice!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
2087,"2014-11-27",4.2,"Growler (2 liters). Filled at the brewery yesterday. Murky yellow with a medium easy too revive white head and good lacing. Aroma features the hops very nicely for such a low abv beer with a great tea/floral presence, hints of citrus and some dankness. Taste is of tea/floral presence with light citrus, a light but super effective malt backbone and almost no bitterness. Body is light, but never watery. Moderate carbonation. Fluffy and full mouthfeel. Floral finish. Perfect palate for a 3.6 % abv beer. Its in the same league as Walden. Incredibly tasty and the epitome of drinkability. Making a 3,6% beer that tasty with that kind of body is really impressive.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
