Looks: Translucent deep brown colour with lots of trunky yeast sediments; Explosive three finger head with crumpety off-white foam which lasted for 2 minutes; Moderate sticky lacing and slight carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragment roasty light malt, with banana, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, wheaty tartness, chocolate, strong yeast, cloves, spices, and very light grass.

Taste: Light sweet roasted malt, with very light tart notes, light banana, strong caramel, toffee, light caramel, burnt toffee, toast, light phenolic, strong yeast, cloves, spices, faint lemon, fairly low bitter hops and very light grass.

Body: Mid to light. Quite slick palate.

Hoppiness: Very light grassy nose, faint lemon and grassy taste. Bitterness is very low-fi in background for an abrupt detectable lowly semi-finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Very easy and caramel-ish to mouth.

786,"2014-05-23",3.2,"Transferred from BA reviewed on 3-10-12 - 
Poured from bottle into pint glass

Appearance Pours a hazy lighter brown color with a large billowy off-white, bordering tan, head. The head is nice and thick in nature and fades over time to give a persistent film on the brew and leaving some spotty lacing on the sides of the glass.

Smell  Yeast aromas are the most prevalent with hints of darker fruit mixed in. There is some bready aroma in there as well with a little bit of spiciness.

Taste  Sweeter malt flavors with a bit of yeasty flavor are upfront. The sweetness gives way a bit of dryer roasted flavors. While losing some hold in the middle of the taste, the sweet flavor does persist and at the end seems to gain ground again with some caramel flavors which mix with a bit of nuttiness.

Mouthfeel- Rather thin with a slightly above average carbonation level. The body is a bit lighter than expected and threw me off at first. It is really too thin and carbonated for the more roasty flavor of the beer. The mouthfeel of this one is a little off in my opinion.

Overall - A good, look and smell and a pretty nice flavor profile, but the mouthfeel definitely leaves something to be desired. Not bad, but not great either.","","Darkmagus82"

Theres no reason not to pick up a whole line of the Franziskaner beers, then, and give yourself a week to take in a little German culture and art. I started my horizontal tasting with the Hefe-weissbier Dunkel, appealingly dark, but certain to have a refined elegance reserved for lighter beers. and lagers. It pours with a somewhat thick light brown head, and the body glows with a deep and dark-orange red color, like a dying ember. I cant catch much aroma through the foam, so I dig a shaft through the bubbles and take a sip. It begins with a light core of chocolate, accented with clove and brown sugar, resembling a pumpkin beer without the vegetal notes.

786,"2011-05-22",3.2,"I didnt review this until a number of years into my project... had a gazillion times, used to pick one of these up and have with a packed sandwich when on the go... your basic German Dunkel.  Mit Weiss!  Appearance is a murky dark, muted brown color... head is fine, off-white.  Looks heavy, malty, and beefy in only the way that the Germans (and Scots) can produce.  The aroma is uneventful, but good for a Weissbier, with hefty malts overpowering the inevitable wheat.  The flavor packs the wheat in, though, with a really soft and silky body of lightly roasted malts, powerful wheat, and an almost caramelized banana and spice finish.  Im probably not giving this beer the fair chance it deserves since my palate has strayed away from appreciating weizens over the years (hence the relatively low grade), but for a weizen/dunkel, its really palatable, unoffensive, easy to throw down, and incredibly decent.  What it takes to be a German beer... easy to drink, but beefy enough to still be called a beer.  I dont always drink weizens, but when I do I drink a dunkel.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

786,"2011-04-24",3.7,"The authentic German hefeweizen is probably the best beer to drink in the summer, but what about the three other seasons of the year? For spring and fall theres the slightly darker, more robust style known as the dunkelweizen. I havent had much experience with this style and decided to start off with the Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel - an authentic German offering of the authentic style. It wasnt quite as impressive as some of the German hefeweizens Ive tried, but it was darn good beer in its own right.I poured a 500ml bottle into a traditional German wheat beer glass.Appearance: Pure brown with slight maroon haze color; very cloudy body although massive carbonation is easily seen. Forms a large, frothy, beige head which retains and laces below expectation. Smell: A subtle, organic, mild aroma of banana bread and apple sauce. Smells genuine, and not like a candle shop like how many beers with added spices to tend to smell. Taste: I dont think Ill ever get sick of drinking real German wheat beers. The first taste of the first swig of Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel was so tasty it immediately reminded me of why I love these types of beers. The palate is just like the aroma with a sweet taste of banana bread and applesauce with cinnamon on top. Unlike many other Its not overly-spicy and peppery, but much more subtle than most beers of the sort. The flavors here are milder, but more refined with no harsh edge to them. In fact, the only real flaw with this beer is that it might be just a little too mild as it noticeably weakens and flattens out the more I drink. Mouthfeel: Slightly fizzy and lively at first, but becomes noticeably flatter and thinner once the head dissipates. Not quite light-bodied, but difficult to peg as a proper medium-bodied beer.Drinkability: Almost ridiculous in how smooth this beer goes down. It finishes with a quick burst of bread, fruit and spice, but leaves little to no aftertaste making it very refreshing. ""Helles"" hefeweizens are the preferred summer brew, but this would perform just as well in warmer weather. The 5% ABV seems a little lower than it performs, though, as it feels like a heavier, stronger brew.Overall, a refreshing and tasty beer to drink in any weather. Not mind-blowing, but a solid performer for sure.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Caramel and toast.  Mild clove and orange rind.  Medium bodied with a sticky and lingering body.  Flavors of citrus and bananas.  Tart berries and slightly sour.  Second and final pour was activated and produced a substantially more sedimented product.  Brown and brakishly opaque.  Similar three fingers of dense off-white head.  The aromas are similar with just a touch more emphasis on the toasty malts and slight caramel sweetness.  Lingering finish that has a mix of zesty citrus effervescence and a trace bitter fruit flavor.  Still a good body.  Prime example of the style.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sneagrams3"

Yeast is the first thing to hit the mouth and its fairly big. Theres a bit of dark malt in there. Sour. Sourness that sticks around behind the molars. Maybe a hint of bananas and dry and somewhat empty. Beer massages the tongue with its sour yeasty assault and leaves the mouth tingling. Found myself tasting but avoiding smelling it.

786,"2009-04-23",3.7,"Presentation: It was poured from a 16.9oz brown bottle into a Weizen glass.

Appearance: Its body has a brownish or ice tea color with a cloudy appearance. On top sits a big creamy tan head that has good retention, lasting until the finish after slowly fading to a small cap of foam. Its lacing was slick and slid down the glass as I drank.

Smell: The aroma hits you with a big overripe banana followed by some other fruity and earthy yeast notes with a touch of clove.

Taste/Mouth feel: The flavor starts with a lightly roasted wheat malt base with some fruity banana clove notes coming in. The wheat and yeast flavor gets dryer and brings dusty earthy notes. Hop flavor and bitterness is light and most noticeable in the finish. The finish is very dry with a smooth, thick, almost powdery texture. Carbonation feels about average and the body is a good solid medium.

786,"2008-07-08",3.5,"Franziskaner Hefe-Weissbier Dunkel is a cloudy, marvelously brown beer.  It’s very sparkling and wears a dense, splotchy, oily, off-white head that leaves nice lacing.  The aroma is spicy: banana and nutmeg, mostly.  It’s pretty light bodied, a little watery, but reasonably smooth.  The flavor is pretty faint.  It’s fruity like raisins and spicy like clove and nutmeg.  It’s sessionable, refreshing.","Fairport, New York, USA","yesyouam"

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a murky, light to medium brown with an average-sized, off-white head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing. The aroma was wheat, spices, banana and very light chocolate malt. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and acidic; while the finish was light to moderately sweet, moderately acidic and a little sour with an average to long duration. There was malt, wheat, yeast and spice. Also some banana and slight chocolate. The light to medium body was dry with quite fizzy carbonation and a light astringent and also dry finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

786,"2008-01-18",1.8,"Rated first time: 25 November 2006; second time 5 December 2006; third time 27 December 2007. 
Bottle 500 ml, brown, no info about the extract of wort. 
After rating it three times the worst dunkel weizen Ive ever had for sure and the thinest. Poor job of Munchen. 
Appearance: Pours reddish brown (but more towards brown). Munich dark malted barley in colour, cloudy-hazy body with medium, definitely not lively carbonation, manifesting itself in a weak grey and really small, hopeless head, quickly and almoust completely disappearing what is surprising in a negative way as for that style of beer poured into a properly prepared weizen glass. No lacing, forget it !!!
Aroma: As compared to Schofferhoffer Dunkelweizen aroma is less intensive, rather weak, some hidden notes of toasted barley malt, Munich dark malt, weak aroma of burned suggar and some yeasts. You really have to do your best to find out what this faint aroma really presents. Much more simplified aroma than for example Schofferhoffer Dunkelweizen being also very far from the best. 
Flavour: Very weak and  generally wattery, some sweetness from white sugar and Munich malt, weak and poor, boring and uninteresting, some notes of vanilla, dust, reminding a cheap plonk among beers in its simple and strong effervescence and accidity and poor palate. Very flat and short finish, flat and withought character. 
Palate: Body is light, texture is wattery with unpleasant notes of simple white sugar sweetness, almoust like a tap water containing melted white sugar, a bit dull and heavy. Definitely NEGATIVE. Palate apart from veak banana hints in nose is practically non existant, again like palate of carbonated mineral water with sugar. Still drinkeable (when you have only one) and NOT REPULSIVE, serving an interesting experience what a dunkelweizen can be.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

Smell; this has a very strong wheat profile, with some mild banana notes. Theres a sweet caramel malt presence that kind of overrides alot of the smells I usually associate with a hefe-weizen.

Taste; the caramel malts are there but not quite as dominant as they are in the aroma. The yeast and wheat flavors come out as well as the typical cloves you would expect, but its a little lacking as far as any banana flavors go. Dont get me wrong, the bananas are there, theyre just weak enough that you have to search for them a bit.

Plentiful carbonation rising upwards quickly.Muted clove, and bananas covered in liquid brown sugar, with a soft note of mushy brown bread.  A bit of dry, black pepper phenol on the end, and some highly nutty, dull yeast.  Seems quite dry, though, without any alcoholic overtone (no fusels).  Even some hops?

Still really didnt rock my world, yet I could easily find myself downing a dozen or so in quick succession with the heat of this years summer. Upon cracking the bottle it became the 3rd Spaten brew to gush like a geyser. Once stable in the glass it looked fantastic; dense 2½"" rocky beige head atop a highly charged, hazy chestnut body. Head remained for the length in its enormous guise and drabbed frothy rings down the glass. Milled, biscuity grains in the aroma; doughy and generously spiced with notes of cola soda, bready yeast and crumbly banana cake. Heavily subdued in the mouth despite the huge opening, and again (like the hell) almost watered down in feel. Unusually the carbonation was quite light allowing the light flavours to linger fully on the tongue. Biscuity and woody with a  tannic and tangy malt mix filling the mid-palate, and lightly drying malt and phenolic spice finishing it off in the back. Similarly tangy briefly after the swallow, or atleast until my next mouthful, which came in ever-increasing repetition until sadly it was gone. Light on, as I have found with the other Franziskaner beers, but easily the best of the lot. Sessionable!!! (50cL, BBE 04/06, Intl Beer Shop, W. Leederville)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Smell is of Bavarian yeast, bread, cocoa, light banana, roasty nuts, cream, and clove.
Taste is equally as good as the aromas.
Mouthfeel is decent. Seems to be medium bodied and refreshingly not to cloying. This would score a bit higher if it filled out the palate just a tad more but its nice, nonetheless.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"

786,"2005-09-15",3.2,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2005 (500 ml bottle: $1.99 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) Pours a cloudy, ruddy brown body, but the large, billowy head, over two inches tall, prevents me from tasting this beer for awhile.  Thats fine, it looks like this bottle of beer is reasonably fresh, not the easiest feat with imported beers.  Wheat and moderately sweet banana emanate from the glass, wheat easily being the dominant aroma, with some other estery fruitiness in there as well, perhaps some apple, and some light spices.  The restrained flavor is also very ""wheat bread"" in character, only mildly sweet, with a fair amount of banana, and a touch of indistinct spice.  Despite the mildly sweet undertone, the palate is somewhat dry, but very smooth and does not fatigue the palate.  Body is generally light-medium, trending toward medium.  And now that Ive finished the beer, theres still a sizeable head to this beer.  Its a very good beer, but not a great one.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

On the nose was a predominant note of banana over grain, straw, bread and yeast.  Tart, fizzy an refreshing with flavors of malt, an herbal spiciness full of cloves, ginger, cardamom and corriander, well balanced by a fair amount of hops -- lending both bitterness and flavor.

Nutty, oily and roasty nose is hugely phenolic and procures blatant salmon notes that won’t leave my mind and pretty much cuts most other nuances I could get out of the nose. I won’t browse through 300+ ratings to get feedback on this, but I’m almost shocked that apparently no one else mentions this, not even in the form of a smokiness. Not so exuberant in mouth, but it remains very simplistic. Don’t search for estery richness in here, straightforward bready yeast procures more sourness than the wheat can dream of while the malt profile is dominated by dull roasted nuts. Herbal spiciness accentuates the enormous ultimately annoying carbonation. A rare feat: a weizen that is tough to finish. Burp.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

The initial palate is refreshingly zesty, but departs from its counterpart with the presence of a lightly caramel sweetness.  Still the expected lemony, orange, banana and clove spiciness develops by mid-palate.  The carbonation level is superb--crisp and refreshing--but not overdone.  The finish, too, is strong and, again, pleasingly refreshing.  Like the Hefe-Weissbier , Im rating this beer high, but just a notch lower.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ivan9856"

Beatifully clouded dark leather brown color with a miraculously tall cap of finely whipped tannish cream that creeps and murks its way down to a hefty skim. Laces in one big drippy sheet.

Taste is a lightly softened tangy and smoothly clean delight of lemony bananas mixed over a pretty solid caramel malt backing. All the while maintains a more dryish malt character and softer clove spice underneath the sweet tang and fruits which floats through consistently right on to the finish where it stays dry and kinda dullish with a pale tang undertow of lemon meringue and a ghostly chocolate roast.

Feel is quite clean with a boastful little shot of carbonation within a semi-soft, steardy, smoothened, creamy medium body. Softly tangy and fruity while dryish over the top and not overly spiced with too much clove; which I like. Mends into an earthy dryish tang in the finish. 
This grew on me by leaps and bounds as I continued to enjoy it more and more after each sip. The softer smooth body is more to my liking compared to most weizen type brews. Quite smooth and nealry chewy with the perfect tang and spice. A solid dunkel.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

A delicious sweet fruitiness runs through the length of the brew, and rewards one in each and every sip. Yeast is a strong flavor component, giving an overall feel of sweet, fruity bread, all blended up and beery of course!

same pint .9 bottle as last time.  This beer is good, good in that it has potential to be way better.  It is much better on tap, for instance, than in this tacky bottle.  Im new to dunkelweizens, but this lacks a little flava and lot of alcohol for its dank yeastyness.  Banana and very lite citrus.

Wheat nose - slight spice, clean, acceptable, not exciting. Thin, vanishing mouthfeel, initially wet, but slightly drier in the finish. Metallic all round. Slight wheat flavours coming through with the most vague, wimpy, lazy, couldn't be bothered dark malt flavours lurking around in the background - sometimes coming forward only to vanish away quickly.

786,"2002-01-09",4.4,"big, proper head.  a little bit lighter than the other weisse-dunkels ive had.  pleasant aroma, grainy, banana and toffee, which continues on the palate.  great characteristic banana and honey, moving towards cloves and malty textures.  lively mouthfeel.  finish is a tad bit spicy, with cloves and maybe pepper?  this is head and shoulders over the erdinger weiss-dunkel i had recently.  franziskaner exceeded my expectations here.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
786,"2001-12-19",3.8,"Looks kinda like Coke, rather fizzy and with a big head--a little different, so I liked it.  Aroma surprisingly malty for a Weiss, sweet and pleasant but not remarkable; flavor echoes this, maltier and less wheaty than the Hefe (this might be the first Dunkel weiss Ive had, so perhaps this is typical), with light spiciness and lemon; good, but not spectacular.  Good body and finish; well worth trying.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
786,"2001-12-07",3.7,"Not the best dunkle Ive had but still very good. Lots of the classis hefe weizen crispness and hint of banana. The dunkle maltiness is a little hidden.","Smithfield, Virginia, USA","bonvivant"

786,"2001-11-26",3.7,"A very nice dunkel. matches the high standard  set by their hefeweiss.
A pleasant mix of the yeasty clove-like taste that I associate with a good hefeweiss and some nice sweer maltiness.
I find this a touch overcarbonated otherwise this could rate as a classic.","Bombay, INDIA","ravidesai"

Light to medium bodied, very wheaty taste, subtle yeastiness and spicyness in the palate. Texture is a bit watery but lots of style and to get a beer of this quality for $1.59, your not going to hear me complain...infinitley drinkable","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"

786,"2001-05-26",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2005 500ml bottle. Full, spicy, doughy yeast aroma, plenty of strong clove and banana with a hint of rich caramel, lemon and some nicely bready maltiness.  Thoroughly opaque medium amber-brown color with a fluffy, lasting, ivory head.  Flavor is mildly tart and fruity to start, becoming sweeter and maltier before the big yeast finish, more upfront spices and lingering, sweetish toffee combined with a tangy, citric presence and mild bitterness.  Lightly acidic and highly effervescent mouthfeel with a light-medium body.  Very flavorful and seemingly quite properly Old World.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
