3325,"2017-05-01",3.5,"Pours hazy amber with average head that sticks around for while and leaves bit of lacing. Really well balanced.

3325,"2016-11-04",2.0,"Sample from can as part of autumn big clean up. Aroma: raw wheat, caramel, light spices, light herbs. App: clear copper, small white head leaving great lacing. Taste and palate: light body, medium sweetness, caramel, strong medicinal notes, really strong astringent and bitter finish. Overall: ouch. That mouthfeel is really unpleasant. No idea if because its old but its sure really hard to drink. Will sure need to drink something else to get rid of this taste.","St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Stoned99"

Well, the up side to this one was its surprising bitterness, which though not high by comparison to many modern IPAs, might well be the highest Ive seen for any Molson product. The down side was well everything else. Grainy malt and bready yeast dominant the aromas, with weedy, grassy hops lurking in the background. Tastes slightly better than it smells, though, and its not terrible overall. Cant see bothering with another any time soon - or ever again. (11/20)","CANADA","UXO"

3325,"2015-06-07",4.1,"A surprisingly flavourful and unique offering from Creemore. Great balance on the nose between honey and hops, with sweet honey predominating. A clean tasting beer, with the honey promised by the aroma being delivered in good balance with crisp hop bitterness. The hop profile is more prominent than many other beers of this type and is extremely welcome. Enigmatic hop notes, not easily attributed to one variety. Very drinkable.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Slepkov"

3325,"2011-10-16",3.5,"My Bottom Line :  
Burnt caramel notes and green leafy hops harbor fruity edges in this prickly and quenching Kellerbier. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-Fluffy sheets of foam disappear into the misty golden amber. 
-Prickly bubbles and slender residual sugars make for good drinkable.
-Hop character is authentic throughout; leafy, citrusy and spicy too, especially upon warming.
-Toasted cereal flavors are engaging. The burnt sugars though (direct fire) can get a tad too present for my liking.
-While Im not a fan of the grain bill in this one, I have to say this is the closest any Canadian brewery has gotten to a real Franconian Kellerbier. Bravo! Their Pilsner is even more compelling imho.
-Mineral notes peek through here and there. Water? Can?

Says ""generously hopped"" on the can, and you can smell the beautiful floral hops. Also, kind of grainy and hazy a bit (as it also says on the can ""Unfiltered"") but wish it would be even less filtered. Again, the nice blend of hop and grain malts in the taste.

It has a rich copper hue with a hazy body, and a remarkably fresh and enticing aroma that holds notes of toasted grain, dried grass and juicy hops, along with a hint of yeast. The body is lightly carbonated, and while the flavour seems a bit muted at first, giving the beer a few minutes to warm allows it to open up considerably, revealing a perfect balance between sweet, caramelish malt and pleasantly bitter hops, with a delicate suggestion of lemon zest in the finish. The yeast is also noticeable, but not overpowering, it just adds a well integrated depth and richness to the flavour.

In mouth, a good sweety nutty malt, grainy mash, and good German hops, a bit light in mouth. Can from LCBO, shared with probstk, Sept. 12 2009.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
3325,"2009-10-16",3.5,"Can from the LCBO.  Clear body, fluffy white head.  Nose is spicy noble hops, reallly nice toasted malt, a small amount of caramel, some fruitiness.  Flavor is that nice toasted malt, decent hop (Id like a bit more) flavor.  Finish has really great maltiness, maybe a small hint of sulfur & more of that noble hop goodness.","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"
3325,"2009-10-12",4.2,"One of my favourite beers in recent memory.  Why?  Cause its was so pleasantly balanced.  It had nice spicy hops but not too much to make it just a sipping beer.  It was light enough to be able to enjoy more than one at a time.

If anyone has had the Tankhouse by Miss St. then Id say its like a lighter less bitter version (and thats not knocking the Tankhouse).","Alberta, CANADA","XtraStout"
3325,"2009-10-08",3.8,"Canned sample via sammy. Pale orange in colour with a bit of haze and medium carbonation. Aromas of mild citrus, herbal hops, pale malts, and yeast. Great herbal hop flavors dominate the palate, supported by tea buscuit like malts, sublte yeast notes, and a hint of tart orchard fruit. Fairly dry and very refreshing on the finish. Well balanced. I could drink lots of this.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"

3325,"2009-09-16",3.6,"In short: A pillowy nourishing, refreshing and hoppy golden lager.  Superior tasty session lager.
How: Can 473ml.  Consumed fresh a few weeks after receiving it from HogTownHarry.  Thanks a lot Harry.
The look: Partly cloudy golden orange topped by a medium white head
In long: Pleasant nose of hops that are between leafy and tea-like.  Reminds me of some Sterling based beer Ive had, I might be wrong though.  A smooth pillowy body with a nice marriage of the malts and yeast giving the beer a nice doughy and bready character.  Taste of citrusy dough, fresh white bread, floral notes, some grass, tree leaves, apricots.  Some unusual but not unpleasant vegetable notes (I did picked up carrot !?!).  Overall this beer feels nourishing and refreshing.  Very sessionnable.  In my country where we make shitty cars and female swimmer have less testosterones than I do, it is nice to find something that truly feels german.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3325,"2009-09-04",3.8,"500ml Can: I first tried this at the launch party at Victory Cafe, managed to find some cans in store tonight to try it again. Pours copper and cloudy, a very large foamy white head, excellent looking beer.  Aroma is sour lemon, brown sugar, fresh bread, hops.. wow, really nice. The first sip is bready, peach and a hop bite on the tip of the tongue, chased with a distinctive tea character.  Second sip I guzzled, grabbed some great hop bitterness with an almost Meyer lemon character, right back into that tea chaser. This is truly the lager for ale drinkers, tons of flavour and character, just an excellent job.","Bolton, Ontario, CANADA","Slacks"
3325,"2009-09-04",3.5,"Amber colour with an aroma of hop and citrus.  Taste is superb.  Citrus playing on the palate with the hop bitterness on the way down.  A winner for Creemore, wish I bought more than one.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","cfrancis"

Doesnt have the insane hop kick I was expecting, but the hops are certainly there and just counterbalanced by a smooth honey and citrus finish. Excellent balance found. Not an extreme beer, but has a great everyday beer quality to it.","Mississauga, Ontario, CANADA","AWS9"

3325,"2009-08-21",3.7,"473 mL can.  Looks like regular Creemore, only cloudy.  Great lacing, as with the original.  By the end of the glass, there was some grainy sediment in the bottom.  Grainy/earthy/herbal aroma.  Flavour has grainy malt, spiciness, a little thin caramel, and a slight bitterness.  Quite full and flavourful for a lager.  Another solid beer from Creemore.","Cavan Monaghan, Ontario, CANADA","TheJester"
3325,"2009-08-19",3.6,"Fizzy dark golden bordering on light orange. A small slice of white foam stays atop it all and does not last much despite the active bubbling. Grassy, softly earthy and lemony nose shows more hop character than anticipated. Leafy and fruity on the palate, its almost juicy in terms of flavours, yet bright and crisp in terms of carbonation. Not so yeasty, farmy, floral, pils malt focused like top German examples, but fresh and bright nonetheless, leaning more towards the tea-like/lemonade/peach nectar/apricot juice side of things, but refreshing and hugely drinkable. Id kinda stopped following Creemore Springs since a few years, but this is a most honourable new product. Lingering fruity, citrusy and herbal bitterness","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

3325,"2009-08-01",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2010 473mL can shared by matt7215 at our casual Saturday afternoon mini-tasting. Thanks Matt. Sampled side-by-side with Trois Mousquetaires Kellerbier. This one pours an only slightly hazy orange with a small white head. Wheres all my sediment? The aroma is definitely akin to everything I expect from Creemore. Corn, grain husks, sweet malts, but with a lot of citrus, tangerine, and a touch of dry hoppy yeastyness. Flavour is very smooth, mild carbonation which is good. Very sweet upfront, all the usual Creemore flavours but with some dry yeast and minor hop elements chiming in. Very simple actually, qutie drinkable though even as a fan of good lagers I dont completely comprehend the hype around this one. That said, Id still buy it semi-regularly if possible, and Im happy to see a more obscure style being produced in Ontario. Filter it even less and Id like it a lot more. EDIT: 2010 version is actually much better. Same elements but richer and better done. More noticable hop activity in the aroma and flavour, this tweaked version is one of the best things being done in this province IMHO.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"
3325,"2009-07-31",3.9,"Can from the LCBO. Appearance: Pinkish orange with a small off white head and good visible carbonation. Aroma:  Slight perfume, some grassy hops, malt, some light lemon peel and grain. Flavour: Initially malt, nice grassy hops (as opposed to the grassy hops that I personally dislike) a good creaminess to the body with a sweet hop finish, the more Im drinking it - the better its getting. Good work Creemore, a solid brew. Oh - refreshing too!","Dublin, IRELAND","garthicus"

Palate:  Medium body and carbonation.
  
Flav.:  Lots of apricot/peach, biscuity malts to a lesser extent, some of the the Saaz hops, though not much, a little wet hay and a bit of black tea; dry with fair bitterness and a pleasant lightly-roasted malt finish.

Pours a hazy golden colour with a decent light tan head. The aroma is very rich, malty and hoppy at once, a really nice blend of smells. The taste is very rich and flavorful. Very nice malt start which quickly turns into a more notable hops kick. They really have a nice hop blend in this beer and it translates nicely into the palate as well. A very full mouthfeel with the lingering hop bitterness.

For aroma, I get much of that familiar Creemore nose, but fuller and fresher - a bit of sulphur, light fruit, and a touch of hops.  Flavour is similar, with a yeasty, bready component.  A very nice beer, but Im not as blown away by it as others.  Similar to, but better than, the regular Creemore lager, and certainly better than the pilsner.

Solid aroma - light cereal/biscuity malt, a lot of floral/herbal bitterness - almost makes it to 8/10 but theres a little more alcohol on the nose than I would have expected, but thats a minor quibble.  Taste - very, very nice - fresh grassy/herbal bitterness and perfectly balancing biscuity malt - I get that little bit of lemon zest too - yummy.  Light, chewy, nice dry aftertaste - frankly, WAY better than what the normal Creemore has become over the past 5-6 years (I know, I know - ""Molson hasnt changed anything!""  - bullshit).","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

Very inviting fresh aroma - bread, biscuit, wet trees in a forest (Im stretching, but that is what it smells like - so fresh). Taste - terrific.  Surprising hops right up front, giving way to fruity malt, and an interesting spicy hop finish.  Mouthfeel is very reminiscent of fresh Creemore lager, soft and actively carbonated.  That finish is something else - now Im getting honey and citrus to go with the spiciness.  Wow, there is a ton of flavour here, what a great job Creemore (and thanks for leaving them alone Molson)!

Poured a hazy orange-gold lager in the stein, Frothy 2 finger cap with good retention and glass- lacing properties.

Pungent aroma of fresh bread and herbal-woody noble cones with a musty-earthy undertone.

Sturdy malt spine, ample body, creamy mouth feel, round mellow character and tons of flavor.

The front side of this beer assaults the senses with a big malt blast titrated by succulent herbal leafy hop balance, mid palate it mellows and the rounded aged character is evident, bready hoppy finish.

A faithful interpretation of this German lager style. Extremely fresh, flavorful and mellow. I wish all premium craft  lagers could satisfy this substantially with so much fresh flavor. I can see me going though my 4 cases rather fast.

 Aroma is leafy wet hops, malty with some lovely fruit, unfiltered giving a cloudy orange marmalade colour, sporting a firm long lasting finger of custard head, some pretty lace too. The flavour is again fresh wet leafy hops, gorgeous malt, with apples and red pitfruit. Light bodied, especially well balanced, lucious mouthfeel, creamy smooth. The first two of three pints that I enjoyed, were not very cold, and came across like a cask version. I would suggest when this is available for purchase to try it just slightly cool.

Peachy cloudy appearance with long lasting white generous head, leaving lace traces.  Yeasty and spicey and malty aroma. Medium mouthfeel, the yeast cushions but above average carbonation offsets this and prevents a full two pints from being consumed, still very drinkable.  Significant hops, including dry hopping, I like the unfiltered taste.  Drying finsh. Bang on style, it hits the ontario market between the eyes, and just as Creemore brought craft back in Ontario about 20 years back, this will be a paradigm shifter.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
