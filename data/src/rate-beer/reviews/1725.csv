AROMA: Potent Bavarian yeast esters of banana and clove; wheat imparts bready aroma. Some orange sherbet scent in the background. 11/12APPEARANCE: Hazy amber/orange, but translucent. Effervescent carbonation visible. Large, white, froth laces and retains well. 3/3FLAVOR: Moderately strong banana bread flavor throughout (wheat + esters). Clove is prominent as well and imparts a light peppery sensation. Faint orange juice concentrate as it finishes. Hops are used sparingly and complement the natural spicy sensation. Each sip is delicious. 19/20MOUTHFEEL: Medium body with a nice viscosity. Mouthfeel is soft, comfortable and smooth. Effervescent but too thick to be crisp like a lager. Aftertaste is mostly clean with minor banana flavor. Very refreshing and easily quaffed. 5/5OVERALL IMPRESSION: Probably the best hefeweizen being made in the USA today and better than many German brews of the style.

Finish: Really sweet citrusy malt lingers, with no hop character to balance and little carbonic bite.

1725,"2012-03-12",3.6,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/22/2011.  Poured from a 32 oz. growler into a tulip.

My pour is a hazy straw color with a bubbly off-white head. Not much retention or lace, but I expect that out of a growler.

Less of a sweet aroma than I would expect out of a Hefe. Some honey, banana, and light malt notes. A little white grape skin and green apple, maybe from another yeast strain?

The flavor is soft, nuanced, and balanced. There is a soft pale malt front with some honey, banana, and clove, but a white grape and green apple adds some tartness toward the end. 

This is light and dry compared to the normal example of the style. It feels like they have added a yeast to dry it out further than usual. The carbonation is crisp and contributes to the dryness.

1725,"2011-10-24",3.7,"Draft at Funky Buddha.  Looks filtered to me, which is odd for a Hefe.  Orange-yellow with a small, foamy white head.  Really clean and well done, fresh and zesty.  Orange banana and a nice balancing clove bite.  The adjuncts really give it some depth and flavor, but it remains a highly sessionable medium bodied beer.  Loses a few points for not really being true to style, but gains them right back for being tasty.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

3.5 A: Dark hazed yellow color. One quarter inch white, frothy head.

4.0 S: Clove heavy. Banana underneath with a good spiciness overall. Neutral wheat. Pleasant.

4.0 T: More banana than clove in the taste. Good spiciness with neutral wheat. Light yeastiness and clean overall.

3.5 M: Medium body. Good carbonation for the style. Reasonably creamy.

4.0 D: Solid hefe. Good all around.

1725,"2011-08-11",4.0,"Growler.  Aroma is full of bready malts and fruit; lemon and orange, some nice weizen yeast phenolics, slight sweetness.  Pours a very cloudy golden color with a hint of orange, almost milkshake appearance.  Tastes fantastic; lots of citrus fruit, very yeasty and bready, oranges and lemons, slightly tart in the finish, very refreshing.  Medium-full body on this one, thicker than expected but it works really well, smooth and creamy on the palate.

This is a straight forward Hef, but has some crazy yeast notes that push the beer over the top in the categories of aroma and taste. Tons of fruit flavors dance on the tongue with this beer. The body is solid and is carbonated just right for the style.

1725,"2011-03-14",3.2,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2011 Sampled at Redlight Redlight courtesy of the Orlando ratebeer crew; January 2011
The beer pours from the growler with a hazy gold hue and is topped by a thin, white ring of a head.  The nose of this beer has a funky, autolized yeast character to it as well as a touch of citrus.  The yeasty quality in the aroma is quite distinct and does a really thorough job of drowning out most of the Hefeweizen character that might otherwise be here.

The flavor has the characteristic character of a Hefeweizen, but a touch more yeasty tasting.  It has a light citrus character to it up front and the finish is very rich with vanilla notes.  The vanilla gives this beer a creamy texture despite the beer being fairly light bodied; this would be excessively quaffable if the ample vanilla character didnt seem quite so rich.  The autolized yeast character from the aroma is non-existent in the flavor (perhaps the vanilla notes drown it out, which would certainly be a good thing).  I am not quite to sure what to think of the citrus and vanilla additions to this beer, it certainly takes this Hefewiezen in an interesting direction, the vanilla especially is quite distinctive; still I think they hit the mark with what they were aiming for, but I almost wish this was just a solid version of a German Hefeweizen.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
1725,"2011-03-07",4.2,"This is one badass hefe!  Holy hell!  I could drink this by the half-barrel.  Pours hazy straw yellow with a nice white head.  Nose is orange, orange, peel, berry, honey, vanilla, and ripe banana.  Flavor has the malt/ wheat presence of a hefe, the sweetness of a witbier, and the vanilla presence that blends the whole thing together.  I must say that this style is usually one and done for me, but I had to have three glasses of this beer.  Thoroughly enjoyable, very balanced, and incredibly Floridian.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
1725,"2011-03-01",4.2,"Tap pour sampled outside the brewpub adjacent to the parking lot and amid lots of hip too cool for school cigarette smokers. It poured up opaque pale dull gold with thin white head. The aroma has an inviting level of wheat and then moving into a bit of banana and then followed by grainy malts, more banana and faint yeastiness. The taste is bold with thick smooth wheat, mild yeasty spices and growing banana. I get a dash of lemon showing up here and there too. Theres also a pleasing smooth cream soda or vanilla like note in the background that pulls this thing together and allows the experience to achieve flavor harmony despite the acrid smoky surroundings here. This beer leaves me wanting more. I didnt think I would get this into a hefe. Im pretty sure this is the best one Ive had to date. The thin slick sweet background of vanilla works perfectly here. Well done!","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
1725,"2011-02-03",3.9,"Appearance: hazy plucked husked and ready to be mulled grains. White collar leaves large chunks of foam wherever she touches. Swirls lovely.

Nose: gently soured wheat; sour dough. Lemon and orange cream; creamsicles. Pureed bananas and green plantains to add a zip to the sour dough.

Palate: smooth and creamy. Bananas all around with cream in the middle for a quaff, banana cream, another quaff, bananas and cream. Green plantains and banana skins. Spice tickles in the back with a soft dryness underneath to induce thirst. Lemon and orange are an estery presence, melting into and about the creamy doughy bready profile bordered by greenness.

Final Thoughts: wow and wow. An excellent American hybrid hefeweizen, and best of all shes brewed right here in my home state of Florida. A summer sunshine brew if I ever did taste one. Good show!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"
1725,"2011-02-03",3.2,"Tap. Moderate malt note of cookie and cereal, light perfume for the hops and dough for the yeast, with a hint of banana and a big dose of vanilla. Head is small, frothy, white with some spotty lacing and is almost fully diminishing. Color is hazy light amber. Flavor is moderately sweet and lightly acidic to start, then finishes moderately bittersweet. Palate is medium, slick with a lively carbonation. An interesting German Hefeweizen, but a little too pastry-like from the addition of the vanilla.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

1725,"2011-01-12",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 13, 2015 My Bottom Line:
Citrusy connotations dwell within banana purée and biscuity cloves in this sweetish Weizen.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A thick ring of foam circles the cloudy pale yellow.
-The overt sweetness and medium carbonation take away from the drinkability.
-Vanilla is not that obvious as it is surrounded by honeyed bananas and cereal sweetness.
-The glasses I had in February 2013 and July 2015 showed significant improvement from the one I first had in 2011.br />

1725,"2010-12-26",3.7,"Growler... Hazy, light yellow ale with a small, creamy, white, brief head. The bouquet is very nice and  certainly unique  Dreamsicle with a moderate pinch of  clove. Medium-bodied with a buttery mouthfeel and jazzy carbonation. Sweet, fruity flavor  orange crème and subtle, unobtrusive clove. Crisp, sweet, fruity finish. Two hefeweizens that I really like (Maui Pineapple Hefeweizen) only five days apart? I would have previously thought that impossible. Kudos to the boys at Funky Buddha.
