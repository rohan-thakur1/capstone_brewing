77,"2014-10-14",3.6,"375 ml bottle. BB 26/01/17. From bierkompass.de.
Pitch black colour with a small chocolatey creamy head. 
Roasted malt, chocolate, sweetness, mild port wine and some hops in the aroma. 
The flavour is roasted malt, sweetness, vanilla, chocolate, cocoa and a mild chili burn. 
I just loved the normal version of Texas Ranger so I thought this would blow my mind... no... its just a really sweet version with the chili cut out. Bit of a disappointment really.","Tampere, FINLAND","rosenbergh"

77,"2014-05-26",3.9,"(Bottle) Black colour with lasting, creamy, beige head. Malty, roasted nose with notes of dark chocolate, black coffee, oak wood, black rye bread and a touch of cognac. Malty, roasted taste with dark chocolate, cacao, coffee, vanilla, dark bread, tobacco, oak wood, a touch of cognac and a balanced cacao bitterness in the finish. The chilli stays in the background at the first sip, but grows over time, and gets quite hot after a while. Slightly more than medium body, mainly dry but with some sweetness coming through. Quite complex and interesting. Still very well balanced. Very nice beer.","Hässelby, SWEDEN","Svesse"

There is a noticeable woody character as well. Pretty solid stuff, but I prefer the base beer.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

77,"2013-03-16",3.6,"375ml bottle. Black with a brown head. Deep, powerful aroma of roasty coffee and dark chocolate. Also some cherry and blackberry fruitiness with barrel notes at the edges. On the tongue an initial wash of chocolate drops out abruptly to be replaced by pepper heat. Vanilla only shows up fleetingly and sporadically. It hits a lot of the right notes but does feel pretty muddled at times. Then again its must be a hard task to make a beer with these elements come together right, so well done to Mikkeller on this occasion.","Cheshire, ENGLAND","Nocturne"

Arôme est assez subtile surtout quand on considère le volume dalcool. Cette bière arrive donc a développer un nez unique et appréciable doù se dégage le tonneau, une douceur de vanille et chocolat qui sont évidement plus présents que dans la version régulière de BA quoique la vanille était un peu en retrait.
Ce qui m a vraiment surpris et enthousiasmé sur cette bière est le palais. Là, surprise lorsque lon note les épices qui se dégagent. Vanille est douce, un peu de malt fumé, fèves de cacao donnent une épaisseur à la bière et tjrs ce fini un peu pimenté qui est tout bonnement formidable et accompagne parfaitement un palais qui garde une présence de levure belge.
