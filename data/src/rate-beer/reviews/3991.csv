3991,"2017-03-27",4.6,"Black as my soul and just as bitter, Midnight Hoppyness is a textbook Black IPA for me. Pours an opaque shade of black. Charred malt, coffee, dark bitter chocolate, and hint of peppery rye in the malt profile. Citrusy, grassy, piney, earthy, and floral notes coming from the hops. Its identical on the nose and palate. Viscous texture and the bitterness is very intense. This IPA is heavy, strong, and slightly spice from the rye. It blew me away.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

3991,"2016-06-28",3.0,"Really fortunate to have stumbled upon this! However this bottle may be past its prime. Bottled 2/1/16. Almost opaque pour with dark burgundy edges. Sandy, billowing head settling to a compact cap. Roasty nose, dark chocolate, faded floral hops and grapefruit. Flavor has some nice chocolate and coffee bean, still some hop resin to balance, a bit of candied lemon and tart grapefruit gently on the cacao, espresso-centric linger. Still finishes dry though. The rye really adds an undesirable attribute to a black IPA, for me. The chocolate, hop resin, and feisty rye bite dont exactly meld together seamlessly.

3991,"2016-04-10",4.0,"Very large 3+ inch head if very dense and creamy bubbles. Something you would expect out of a good porter or stout and not a IIPA. Light milk chocolate, pine, band-aids and sweet malts in the aroma. Color is a very dark brown. Very delicious. Moderate malts and dry grains up front with a decent bitterness then mellows out to a nice roastyness, bitter chocolate and grassy hops. Lingering burnt toast and herbal notes. Moderate alcohol presence. Finishes dry and bitter and burnt. Maybe a bit of the rye lingers on the tongue to leave the dry chalkiness. A pretty good black IPA.

Even though this is a 99 overall I wasnt really thinking that I would like it. The 100 ibu and the high abv made me think it would be just like a big bomb of everything but in fact this is really made.

Penguins, eggplants, #2 robertson stubby screwdriver, salad tongs. In the background one can find dark chocolate, pine, sweaty feet, sawdust, dried raspberries, faint coffee filter. Thats all pretty interesting. Flavour is quite different but pure dark and pine. Milk chocolate, orange or lemon or tacos, roast that doesnt get in the way, spice, the rye goodness, creaminess in between the bitter beat down.

Pretty assertive overall. Bigger body, kind of a creamy thicker sort of chewy texture. Lighter carbonation. Light slick finish, more dry taste at the end. Overall, enjoyable stuff, but I feel itd be much better fresh... I can tell that theres a lot of potential here, I think a fresh sample would be much less astringent & have much more hop aromatic.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

The pour is very dark & very carbonated, with light leading bloody around the top eight inch or so of the brew. Nose is that distinctly unnatural marriage of roast & piney hops with a sideswipe of Hersheys Kiss. Not bad, but light. 

Midnight Hoppyness probably made early parole. Wild mix of roast, sweet malts, piney hops, & after all that marches by the parade stand, theres a blast of earthy, spicy rye. At the exact moment of rye detonation theres a hump of bitterness: the finish is a tumbling shaker of everything trying to shout at the top of its lungs for my tongues attention. Smoothness on the palate contrasts with the edged weapon of the chaotic neutral taste bombardment. I was just told Im ""sucking this down"" & indeed my wife has twice as much left as I do. Pace yourself, max.
