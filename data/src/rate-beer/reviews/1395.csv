1395,"2011-04-23",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2011 Incredible fresh sweetness (slight brown sugar, slight caramel, lots of forest woods) in the aroma. So fresh! The slightest amount of a hop spice (herb, pepper) in the aroma. Flavor is quite sweet (moderate-to-high, loads of brown sugar and some vegetable) but kept alive and interesting by the incredible carbonation and conditioning. Bitterness is quite low. Bottle conditioned. Classic dunkel flavors but with a tap freshness. (Polish dunkels could take a serious lesson from this beer). I can see why some might claim infection here; this is a highly effervescent beer! But no signs of sourness. Hand-written best before date of July 13, 2011. No GTIN on these beers. Rerate: several days later, another bottle. A little more smokiness in this bottle, a little less sweetness and a bit of acidity. Very delicious and a dunkel unlike almost any other I can think of. Upped from 4.1 to more...and Im getting a third bottle from the store tomorrow. Love this beer.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
