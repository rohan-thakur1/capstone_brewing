2602,"2017-06-16",3.4,"0.33 l bottle from Bierhandwerk, best before February 2018. Clear, golden yellow with a medium large, foamy, stable, white head. Sweetish, yeasty-spicy and slightly fruity aroma of mainly banana, vanilla and clove. Quite sweet, malty, rather yeasty-spicy taste of banana, vanilla, clove and shy notes of citrus and coriander, followed by a short, slightly bitter, rather yeasty-spicy finish. Medium body, rather effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Tasty, pleasant and saturating beer, but overall I would probably prefer any decent unfiltered Weizenbock.

2602,"2017-06-03",2.8,"A dry hopped wheat Bock? Unusual to say the least!Into a Weihenstephaner tulip at just on cool. Looks pretty lacklustre. Straw gold and bright as bright with a single stream of bubbles lifting up a wash of short-lived white foam. Medicinal, phenolic nose hinting at cloves, plasticine, band-aids, wheat flour - really hard to pick-up and process. On the palate it is light, effervescent and kinked by a spicy alcohol warmth to the swallow. Banana comes through as does lemon curd, green apple, cloves and vanilla icecream. There is a mild bitterness to it but the soft, creamy finish and alcohol oddly lowers its intensity. The use of Crystal, Opal, Emerald, Sapphire and, a favourite of mine, Hallertauer Perle fall short of having much impact. Wheat prominent mid-palate has licks of strawberry bubblegum and tangelo to break it up. Aside the warmth it is highly approachable but just doesntt deliver whatever it was it actually wanted to deliver. I like my Wheat Bocks traditional, and am yet to be wooed by a White IPA. This is actually my least favoured of this great brewers releases. Will cellar one to see how it goes. (33cL, BB 08/02/18, The Liquor Shed, Jandakot)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, bready malt, and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength.

Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, bready malt, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance; and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Light dryness from bitter/spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium-high carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol for 7.5%.
