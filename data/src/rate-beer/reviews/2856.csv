Low sweetness. Excellent mouthfeel. I get scared of BSAs these days because of sugar or imbalance risks, but this pulls it off without flaw.

Taste: Big time herb presence with lots of spice and some dried fruit. The spices are a little overpowering, dry and a little rough. A little harsh, almost like eating a stem or some herbs. As it warms, it calms down a little at least and has some sherry presence but i still find it a little unbalanced for my taste. Not at all what i was expecting.

2856,"2016-07-10",4.2,"A 330ml bottle with a sell-by date that has unfortunately rubbed off. Poured into a Chimay goblet glass.

Aromas of strong dark fruits of plum, prunes, raisin, fig with hints of dark cherry and toffee. Taste was like the aroma, lots of dark fruit with raisin, dark cherry and prunes dominating. Theres also some plum, fig, brown sugar and a touch of alcohol thats not overpowering. Creamy, medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall its a very nice Dubbel.

2856,"2016-05-07",5.0,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2017 33 cl bottle at de Vrede, Westvleteren. I bought six more bottles in order to age them, so this review might change over time. And it has, indeed. 


First rating: 3.6/5. This is my original review, over a fresh one: ""First of all, let me say this is a nice one, but 100? I felt disappointed, given the expectations were high, and loving the Westvleteren 12. Ok, heres the review: pours dark brown with reddish shades. Tan head. Aroma is not particularly high, rather low: honey, violets, dates, prunes, tomato, soy sauce. Mouth is fizzy, medium-bodied, not sweet at all. A little thin. Finish isnt bitter, but it does linger. Lets see within a few years.""


OK, A full year has passed, and the conditions of cellaring have been on point. So heres the second review, for a one-year-old one: 5/5. Yes. 33 cl bottle served in large snifter. Pours dark liver brown, tan creamy head. Aroma is medium to high (it has increased over this 365 days) and shows a lot of nuances: dried fruits (prunes, dates, raisins), red berries such as redcurrant or strawberry; cocoa, pipe tobacco, toffee; fig tree leaf, hints of ripe melon (yum!), chicory (rather than coffee), bonfire embers, honey... Immense.
Mouthfeel is still a little fizzy, slick and mouth-covering. Round, creamy and perfectly balanced: no flavour goes over the rest. It displays sweet, tart, savoury, lacteous, metallic and slightly bitter sides, all of them in equilibrium. Oh, yes, this deserves a 100, but you have to be patient and not rush things.

Still have a couple sitting, waiting in the cellar. Maybe well get even further? Is there anything beyond perfection?","Madrid, SPAIN","huineman"

Rigtig flot grumset brun øl med højt, mediumtæt og holdbart skum. Der er ikke meget at sætte en finger på, første gang man ser øllet. Duften er også rigtig lækker med en vis ristethed, en lang række ubestemmelige krydderier og gær. Den kunne dog være noget tydeligere. Smagen er lækker maltet med en del modne frugter, men mere tør end sød. Til slut er en bismag af nellike til at understøtte det hele. Forholdsvis bitter uden at være for voldsom. Cremet og fyldig.

2856,"2015-12-25",4.2,"330 ml bottle (best before on cap: 19/06/17).
Preparation: Fridged bottle, then cooled at room temperature and popped at 12°C (within recommended temperature range) onto Westmalle chalice.

Looks: Cloudy hazy dark brown with a layer of chunky yeast particels; Half finger head and light beige foam which lasts for one minute;
Very good sticky lacing with bubbly slight carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant and sweet full dark malt, with strong plums, dried figs, liquor alcohol, candied sugar, caramel, strong toffee, vanilla, spices, rye bread, strong Bel yeast, thin lemon and light grass. Not that strong to the nose but multi-layered and very pleasant!

Taste: Strong sweet full dark malt, with strong alcohol, liquorices, candied sugar, plums, figs, dark bread, caramel, toffee, toast, strong spices, strong Bel yeast, lemon and moderate bitter herbal hops.

Body: Medium body. Very slick and quite creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Much like the aroma, its a layered and well-combined bliss of good dark maltyness with strong influence of kick-ass Bel yeast. The dark fruits, caramel, toffee and toast are omnipresent with every sips, closely followed by chewy bread and spices. Pretty strong lemon and herbs to round. Excellent!

Booze and Sweetness: the 8% alcohol is very liquor-like, pronounced and sweet, but not too overbearing and compliment the beer pretty well. Nice!

Hoppiness: Thin lemon and light grass in nose, and much strong plus spicesand herbs in taste. Bitterness, compounded with liquorices, is strong for a lasting, sweet herbal malty finish.

After Taste: Slightly Dry. Sweet, boozy and smooth to mouth.

Comments: As a strong Belgian Dark, this one got a very soulful yeast to sparkle from start to finish. Not as Darwinian as Westvleteren XII, but within BSA this is top stuff, with strong and creamy and layered tastes match toe to toe with the aroma, nice booze and expressive herbal hoppiness.

Au nez, je détecte une présence danis, de sucre brun, de malts noirs, de prunes, de raisins, de figues et de fleurs dalcool et de houblons terreux. En bouche, les saveurs sont amères et douces avec des houblons et des malts, des épices et des fruits foncés. Une très bonne bière belge, il va sans dire car les malts sont superbement travaillés, les levures expressives et les houblons encore jeunes. La bouche est merveilleuse, pétillante, crémeuse, ni trop lourde ni trop mince. Une perfection atteinte, il va sans dire. La finale est bien intéressante, propre, en équilibre, à la fois maltée et houblonnée. Diantre! Dun point de vue objectif, cette bière na aucun défaut.

2856,"2015-08-02",4.3,"(330ml bottle from Bier Tempel, Brussels, July 28 2015) Pours a lightly hazed deep brown with a small but dense and active tan head and lace. Aroma has a dry and dusty character of yeast and spice cupboard. Caramel malts are light to moderate, dried pale fruits, cooked grains, very light roast, nuts. Palate is light caramel sweetness for style, mineral notes of wet stone throughout, particularly in the finish. Cacao bean, figs, white pepper, walnut and pecan, moderate to heavy dry roast, touches of yeast that stay in the background. Never sweet, it becomes almost bracingly dry on the finish, bitter from roast (and maybe hops) and tannic minerality that sucks the moisture from the mouth and leaves more wet stone behind. Light bodied and edging on watery despite flavour. Soft carb. This is really lovely, not in the same league as a typical ""dubbel"" type beer at all. It seems drier, flintier, roastier, and with a special character from the yeast. Really its only the mouthfeel that is a little underwhelming but theres the 12 for that!

Aroma a big surprise, full of dried and dark fruits and fig strongly prominent, more so than Ive noticed before (due perhaps to its slight age, or the warmer temperatures). 

Taste is medium to heavy sweet, with medium bitterness and a light sourness helping to balance things out. Warming alcohol lets you know its strong but without overpowering, and the initial yeastiness drops away to leave a dark fruity aftertaste and enough bitterness to prevent any cloying stickiness. Palate is creamy with a very long finish.

This is one to enjoy slowly, with a good break after before getting another beer. Wasted in a session, this is a perfect bottle for those nights where youre having just the one.

Deep brown color, slightly murky with slight off white head. Lots of fruitiness and sweet malts in the aroma. Dry, earthy, crisp, boozy, sweet. Definitely less rich than 12, more fruity and dry.

2856,"2015-03-09",4.1,"Pours a large head that gently dissipates into a tight 4mm head. Fits perfectly in the glass once the yeast is left in the bottle. 

Exactly the sort of murky colour you would expect. Not beautiful, but suitable for the style. 

Smells of brown sugar, Trappist yeast, a touch of banana peel, dark plums, fig, soda bread and raisins. 

Taste is more immediately warming; cherry tart with a darker fruit following of the aroma. Brown sugar and caramel appear too. 

The mouthfeel is tight and lighter than the quads, but delivers more balance in a better blend than similar Dubbels. 

Overall, a Dubbel will always be a quad/strong dark -lite, but, as this goes, you can't beat this in the style. Less sweet than many of the more accessible versions of the style. More brightness and fruit. Unlike a Leffe Brune, which leaves you needing more, this sits perfectly well by itself and leaves full flavour on the palate.

Sufficient carbonation left in this vintage beer to create a thin off white head but that is not the point. The aroma of figs, prunes and raisins was followed by a smilar taste experience. The palate seems thinner than the XII but is still as it should be and once again I am in awe of the craftsmanship that creates a brew which more than five years after sell by date gives so much pleasure.

Medium thick, creamy, light beige head, opening after a while leaving islands of foam throughout the surface of the Westvleteren chalice as well as a steady rim. Colour a beautiful dark mahogany, slightly hazy and perfectly fit for the autumn days that are coming. Aroma clearly less powerful than in the 12, but almost as elegant and refined, revealing hints of cocoa powder, candied dates, raisins, banana, cloves, liquorice, gingerbread, cinnamon, grapefruit peel, medium dry sherry, pear... But everything in a subtle and noble way, delightfully blended into each other. Taste kicks off with candied fruits and old-fashioned Flemish caramel candy, clearly less sweet than the 12 with less presence of candi sugar, dryish with medium carbo tingling on the tongue and a supple, smooth mouthfeel, all built on a relatively light nutty maltiness, spicy yeastiness and a rather powerful, peppery, leafy and aromatic hop bitterness setting in already before the finish and assuring a long, dry, satisfying finish, yet becoming sweeter as it warms up. More lean, significantly dryer and lighter on the tongue than the opulent 12, but equal in elegance and finesse. Had the monks at Sint-Sixtus not added more hoppiness to the 12 and left it as cloyingly sweet as it was back in the eighties, this lesser God of Belgian top fermentation would have stood a big chance of having been rated higher, since it was more balanced in those days. Compare with Rochefort 8 versus Rochefort 10... Anyway, its been some years since I had this, thanks to Jan for bringing me a sixpack back from De Vrede.  Ill keep a few in the cellar for a couple of years to see how they mature.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Full bodied and medium carbonated. Its quite complex and tasty - more than the usual Belgian Dubbel, and while theres no doubt that it IS a good beer, I cannot in good conscience give anywhere near 5. The peppery tartness detracts from the overall score (imho) and considering the price and limited availability of the beer doesnt do it any favours either.

2856,"2014-03-12",4.3,"The mysterious, mystical unlabelled bottled with a blue cap.
Decided to get a bit ceremonious with this and do a 2-Part pour to decant the yeast - the body is bronze, quite murky with floating bits of yeasty goodness swirling around, carefree, oblivious of their enviable consumption in the near future. A beige head holds as a dense inch of foam for the duration.
Spicy sums up the aroma nicely. A distinct peppery, clovey, phenolic sort of spice; somehow so familiar, as if I were transported back all those years to my first experience with this beers Big Brother. Theres more there though, of course - fruits, almost stewed-like, red fruits even; plums, rhubarb, wild blackberry, very vinous. Theres malt too (surprise, surprise!) - cakey, pudding, caramel, perhaps a hint of chocolate.
Sits full on the palate, not as much weight as expected by the abv, but indeed, a touch of booze tends to dry & draw it out longer. Carbonation is restrained, lightly creamy.
It offers alot of the palate - once again, parallels to the 12 are made, and memory lapses seemingly cured - the more you look the more you find, afterall ; fig, date, walnut, red plum skin & pip, clove, black cardamon, white pepper, milk chocolate, toffee, sultana, another different sultana, wood of some description. Actually a fair hit of bitterness, even a touch of tartness and boozy warmth on a drawn out finish - a slightly wild finish at that, but no complaints!
A multidimensional marvel. I daresay it could easily be dismissed as mediocre when put next to other high quality Belgians of the same style, but theres a real raw, untamed unique complexity in this (as with the 12) that others dont obtain, and is really a joy.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Strong contrast to the palate which offers a smooth well balanced discretely sweet finely textured malty taste, very complex with impressions including biscuit, coffee, mocha, dried fruits.. childhood ice cream memories.

Fairly contained, but apertly fresh nose of caramel, flowers and marmite. What follows in taste is a slowly blossoming symphony of upfront red berries (blue grapes, currants, spicy dried cranberries), milk chocolate, the usual trappist suspects (date, dried figs, caramel), rounded off in the aftertaste with an unexpected spicy Poperinge hop kick. Smooth, creamy and at the same time with a perfectly attenuated dry mf under lively carbonation; vinuous without being barrel-aged, fresh as coriander seasoning in Asian dishes; with the spirit overtones of a liqueur and leaving a long, lingering aftertaste of all that, coating the palate with the retrospect of sensory overload, like an unexpected shagging leaves behind the body.

2856,"2013-07-22",3.8,"Bottle. Cap says ""25 04 11,"" so I believe that makes it a bit over five years old. Gushed on me in spite of being stored at 55 degrees since I acquired it a few years ago. Pours dark brown with off-white head. Plenty of floaties in here that detract from the appearance. Aroma is very bright and fruity. Not quite as full of dark fruit as Rochefort 10, which I had recently so is my only decent, recent comparison, in spite of the style difference. I actually prefer this based on aroma alone. Taste brings caramel and raisins after an initial burst of acidity from the carbonation. This burst becomes less prominent as the beer warms, which is a plus in my book. Palate is full in spite of the spritziness from the carbonation. Finish brings a light astringency to go along with the dark malt flavors. I will say this beer is super drinkable, which for beers of this heft typically fall into the double IPA category for me these days. The flavor profile here reminds me of my favorite BSAs, Abbaye de Rocs Brune (also full of floaties) and Pannepot, but falls a little short. The carbonation and the astringent finish knock it down from that pantheon for me. Still, this is a great beer and one Id drink for the Belgian price all the time.

2856,"2013-01-25",3.9,"Beer bought at In de Vrede café by the brewery. Pours dark mahogany with sone red tints. The beer gives a good frothy head that settles into a noce layer throughout the session. The aroma is slightly discrete, as the 12, but provides more content. Roasted notes, some dried fruit and chocolate?  The taste is malty and roasted, bitterness is combining with some dried fruit to balance it. In this sense it reminds a lot of the 12, which also balances sweetness and bitterness superbly. The bitterness turns into licorice in the aftertaste. The palate is soft, not overly effevescent, medium bodied. The 8 was tasted side-by-side with a 12, and it shares so many things I think it is brewed more or less by the same recipe, but just 2% lower in alcohol. Its a great beer, underrated next to the 12, but defintely not far from it. It is a little more bitter, a little less tastier, and doesnt reach as far as the 12.

Aroma of licorice, dark plums, chocolate, cocoa, tropical fruits, raisins, Ive seen marzipan in another rating and I agree.  I dont know what these monks have thrown into this, but it smells like its from another world.  Taste is very surprising, I dont know what to make of it.  Theres an obvious dark fruit impact with a light burn from the alcohol, and its pretty thick, with a raisin tone and high carbonation.  Theres so much going on that I cant really pinpoint any one ingredient, and its like a big mash of different ingredients.  Pretty damn good stuff, the 12 is still my fav.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"

Aroma is very pleasing and equally subtle. Palate is incredibly soft.

2856,"2012-08-18",4.2,"Poured from that distinctive Westy bottle into a Westvleteren chalice.

Westvleteren 8 pours a dense walnut brown color with a slight cranberry tint.  A creamy tan head forms gently on top with the initial pour.  There was a lot of sediment in the bottom of the bottle, to the point where it was difficult not to pour it in.

Caramel malt, figs, dates, overripe red apples, brandy, and cinnamon gust up my nose.

The flavor is more of the same.  The flavor is not as sweet as I would expect, though.  There is a bit of caramel up front providing a slightly sweet base, but the fig, date, red apple, cinnamon, and all spice do not provide enough sweetness to overcome the boozy brandy that comes through.  There is great integration of the flavors - a sign of long-perfected brewing processes.

The mouthfeel is pretty much perfect, for the style or otherwise.  The body is on the full side of medium, representing the 8% ABV quite accurately.  Each sip has a foamy, creamy carbonation with just a bit of a crisp, tingly bite to it to help ease the flavors down the tongue to reset after each sip.  Very smooth.

Mmm... overripe figs, red wine bits, some Belgian yeast far and away, a mellow blanket of tartness sort of ties everything together. Certainly not as in-your-face as its bigger brother, but it achieves a better sense of balance I think.

Leathery wood notes, dates and figs, super smooth. Its got that tobacco presence thing that bothers me in the Westy 12 but here it is more in balance with the rest of the beer. Subtle lingonberry as well.

Bottle cap dated 01.04.13

A: This trappist ale appears a dark brown color with a substantial head and generous amount of lacing on the glass. Looks very nice.

S: This beer begins to distance itself from other dubbels right away. The aroma is simply fantastic. The Belgian yeast component alone is one of the most inviting and delectable scents I have yet found in a beer.

T: The flavor is incredible. Toffee and caramels amongst the best Belgian yeast strain on the planet. I cant imagine a single way that this beer could possibly improve. So many flavors constantly developing on the palate, all flowing seamlessly together in a work of art, this is a sublime elixir. The conclusion of every drink begs for the onset of another.

M: The feel is yet another flawless aspect of this beer. Its so smooth, it feels like water, yet coats the palate with a myriad of wonderful flavors that evolve from the moment your nose initially detects the beer.

D: I could, and would, drink this beer very regularly, if only that were possible. This is a truly special beer and absolutely worthy of any and all praises.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

La capsule sobre nous annonce une trappiste à 8 %abv, le titre phare pour une 
trappiste, qui nous permet de tester toutes les saveurs de labbaye cistercienne en
question et de constituer une valeur de base. Elle affiche aussi le blason de labbaye.
La bouteille présente une collerette en verre qui précise quil sagit dune bière trappiste.
Rappelons que cette appellation est strictement protégée.
Nous versons le précieux breuvage dans un verre calice, exclusivement. Tout autre
verre constitue un sacrilège par rapport à cette bière. Cela reviendrait par exemple
à verser un Château Margaux dans un verre à Coca.... Do you understand ?
Une couleur sombre superbe, de vraie trappiste brune, avec une mousse beige encore
plus superbe.
Des arômes de brassin en foudre de bois, avec des fruits mûrs de la plus belle origine.
Des dattes, des figues, des prunes, des amandes, des noisettes. Mais aussi de la belle
céréale, une pointe de houblon et de la levure de première classe. Bref, arôme total de
vraie bière de haute fermentation refermentée en bouteille.
Prise en bouche de velours, comme les plus grands velours du Moyen-Age chez les
grands seigneurs.
1er goût sur les céréales et les fruits mûrs, mais avec cette indescriptible pointe de porto
vintage.. On rêve déjà et on a presque peur de la suite.
2ème nez sur le fût de Cognac de la grande champagne (la meilleure région), et aussi 
avec une touche de fruits exotiques splendide, comme sils étaient préparés dans un
restaurant 3 étoiles avec une touche de Chantilly...
2ème bouche sur le plus grand Armagnac que jaie bu du Bas Armagnac, et cétait un
cru de plus de 35 ans, distillé à lancienne... On trouve aussi la nuance des grands
single malts du Speyside, qui ne sont vieillis quen fût de chêne.. Suivez mon regard !
Vous ne trouvez pas ? Mais oui bien sûr, du Macallan...
3ème nez sur du pain grillé, des noix du Périgord et un je-ne-sais-quoi que je mettrais
dans le domaine de la pomme de terre en primeur. En tout cas, ce nest pas triste...
3ème bouche toujours aussi soyeuse, sur un petit côté sous-bois, et aussi écorce 
darbres fruitiers. Une touche de noisette, damande. Lorge de la meilleure qualité,
qui sapparente au malt que lon fait avec du Golden Promise. Et tout cela est lié par
une levure exceptionnelle. Nous sommes donc à un point déquilibre transcendant...
La longueur se révèle divine, très douce, comme doit lêtre le paradis...
On garde constamment cette nuance suave de velouté. Lesprit du divin, sans doute !
Quelle beauté, quelle grâce, quelle onctuosité, quelle saveur, quelle grandeur.
La levure incluse à merveille dans ce breuvage est purement trappiste, de souche
multipliée entre abbayes. Elle se révèle à la fois douce et avec une petite nuance de 
piment. Que dire ? Juste sincliner, comme devant Dieu le Père.
La finale est absolument inimaginable, comme Alice a pensé au-delà du miroir, nous
sommes ici dans lAu-Delà absolu, dans le supraterrestre.. Jen passe et des meilleures !
En bref, si lon peut dire, cest lEsprit Saint descendu sur terre, qui en fait 10 fois le tour
à la vitesse de la lumière, et qui se demande après ce qui lui arrive.
Pour rester sur le plan des chiffres, je rejoins donc la grande communauté des notes
maximales pour me joindre à elle, avec la petite différence que ma note nest pas un 5, 
mais un 666 sur 100. Ce qui entre nous est bien peu pour un breuvage quAlice a 
dégusté au pays des Merveilles. 
Et Spiritus Sanctus. Amen.","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

Poured into the glass that came in the pack (a chalice): everything went in, the sediment arriving half way through the pour.

Deep auburn brown body with a rich looking creamy head sat above.

The nose is complex and delightful, huge fruit esters, both dried and fresh, malty goodness and walnut whips (for the Brits reading this) all seem to vie for position within the aromas.

The taste follows along the same lines, with the vanilla from the walnut whip asserting its self a little more, but not taking over in any way. What a lovely balanced Dubbel, certainly the best Ive ever had in my fairly long life. I can now see what all the fuss is about, later this evening Im having one of my Westy 12s really looking forward to that, what a night Im having.

A nice rich mahogany brown, with nice creamy head (while it lasted).  Aroma was not overly strong (compared to the 12).

We sat on these for almost 30 mins and they warmed up very nicely.

2856,"2011-11-30",4.1,"Appearance: murky browns under a soft bready khaki head. Swirls creamy.

Nose: essence of age  old wood, old leather. Fig and date cake (think ala Fig Newton). Brown sugar pumpernickel underneath  dense. Wet wood. Twigs, dried brush.

Palate: rich and datey, cakey, and figgy. Sweetness than spice  chewy dark fruits than brown wintry spices. Chewy pumpernickel and whole grain breads. Leather and old earth. Nutmeg. Decidedly rich and humble at the same time.

Final Thoughts: Westvleteren is truly the white whale of the beer geek world; though I think its disservice to limit this fine Trappestry and their beer strictly to the beer geek world. Its a fine beverage, possible one of the finest in the world. I believe that of all the Westy beers and if youre truly ever lucky enough to find a bottle or glass in your hand, pour slowly and savor.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Poured like coca-cola. Like the 12, the aroma is whats truly magical and I dont claim to have the palette to identify but its really wonderful. Darker than I expected, like a typical Belgian Dubbel with a slight cherry color especially held up to light. Definitely has a lively fizz to it.

Not cloying at all but caramel toast and bitter hops/malt astringency lingers on the back of the tongue. Light alcohol heat at the end. Huge carbonation but no gushing. Some chunky floaters even with careful pouring is the only complaint. This is a nearly perfect beer. Tastes like a Belgian Munich dunkles.

2856,"2011-09-16",4.2,"Pours with a two inch soapy white head and legs that crawl all over the side of the chalice. The beer is burgundy in color with a hazey appearance. Highly carbonated with streams of bubbles throughout the glass. Chunks of yeast appear as you near the end of the bottle.

The nose is rich with dark fruit, pears, chocolate and candy sugar. The sweet smell of fruit is refreshing and not bitter. As the beer warms you can pick up the yeast aroma.

The flavor isnt as sweet as the nose would imply. Belgian yeast, malt, dark fruit, spices and hops.

The mouthfeel is soft and smooth with a medium body. Has plenty of carbonation without going overboard. Some earthy hops add some bitterness and dry feel to the finish.

Overall a pretty good beer. Im not sure if Ill continue to dish out the high dollars for it though. I know of one competitor that is just as good if not better and I can purchase it right off the shelf. Still a pleasure to have.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","gramity"
2856,"2011-09-15",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2015 It pours an absolutely beautiful brown with a huge tan head that takes its own, sweet time to deflate. The aroma is complex and delicious, with a barrage of toffee, malty sugars, and dark fruity esters (raisins, prunes, currants at the forefront; dry red apples, banana, and a kiss of cherry in the background ), with only a whisper of hops to keep it all together. There are subtle herbal undertones, anise coming to mind. Unforgettable! The taste is an orchestra of flavors that combines sweet, tart, and subtle bitter. Its creamy and balanced and the best thing is that you get the full experience without the slightest alcohol spoilage. It also manages to not be cloying at all -- the only thing I felt after drinking the whole bottle was a sheer, physical necessity to have another one. The mouthfeel is perhaps (just perhaps) a bit watery but, regardless, this is wonderful. Mad thanks to Robert for this.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

The aroma is intensely nutty with lots of chocolate and nice touches of mustiness. The bouquet is earthy and woody and just intoxicating all together. The flavor is chocolaty with a mild spiciness and a mild warming alcohol presence. The beer is as the aroma suggested very nutty and while sweet maintains a perfect balance and control of that sweetness.

2856,"2011-04-23",4.9,"I brought this beer back from St sixtus in Watou three weeks ago. Drank the first one last night. The aroma is very pleasant and is similar to other Trappist Doubles. The aroma grows stronger and more pleasant as you drink it (slowly), allowing it to warm. Malt is the primary aroma with no hop presence. No yeast evidence either as would be the case with a Tripel.

The looks like a cup of coffee. It is rich and dark with a beautiful 2.5 inch light brown head that lessens but lingers for the duration. The head coats the sides of the goblet.

The taste is surprisingly strong of alcohol early in the drink. More so than the Westy 12. This surprised me. This diminished fairly quickly. The flavors dance on the tongue and are equally enjoyed in the rear of the mouth. The flavor strengthens and gets even better throughout the drink. I hated to see it end. The texture was typical Trappist, smooth, creamy and full.

Pours a rich medium brown, remarkably opaque.  Beautiful looking beer.  A thick, dark elixir with about a finger of the only kind of Belgian lace Im interested in.  The head left a gorgeous lacing on my goblet, subsiding slowly and evenly.

The aroma is strong and complex.  The usual fruity esters from the Trappist yeast are detectable in a stunning variety.  I picked up everything from Clove and Cardamom to Bubble gum and dark fruits.  

A luxurious mouthfeel, accompanied by a taste so marvelous and complex it simply cannot be adequately described with any degree of brevity.  Strong esters balance perfectly with rich malt sugar, and the hops lend an edge that evens the whole thing out.

My first experience with Westy, and it was a grand one.  Anyone who crosses paths with this beer is sure to come away satisfied.  Its truly a step above the rest especially when aged as my bottle was.  Worthy of the cost, no matter how much you pay, because there simply is nothing that can compare to it available in the US.

Simply outstanding.  I was ready for a nice beer, and was expecting something along the lines of a Rochefort, which is perhaps my favorite readily available beer.  But this truly blew all three Rocheys out of the water.  It is a cut above.","","alexjucla"

That fades into a molasses and plum sort of flavor that takes you back a bit and hits in a way you are not expecting.

Pours a deep dark chestnut brown color which is completely opaque with a one finger off-white head that slowly fades into a thin lasting ring. Minimal spots of lacing left behind.

Spicy, estery aroma with lots of vinous dark fruit, zesty pepper and earthy hops. Complex nose with lots of plum, grape, raisin, fig, date and dark cherry. This is complimented by a nice roasted malt presence with hints of chocolate and caramel and subtle earthy pine. Peppery with coriander as well as hints of yeast/bread, sweet alcohol phenol and licorice.

Medium bodied with a prominent spicy and hoppy flavor that lingers over the roasted malt body and sweet dark fruit notes into a dry finish. Dry, earthy and slightly bitter with some piny hop flavor which is complimented by the zesty, peppery spice. This is countered mid palate by a slightly roasted chocolate malt backbone with hints of caramel, toffee, biscuit and licorice. Hints of slightly chalky, bready yeast add complexity and fullness to the body. Toward the end of the swallow there is a very prominent vinous dark fruit flavor with hints of fig, raisin, plum, grape and dark cherry. The hops have held up surprisingly well and are very prominent in the flavor profile. The malt and dark fruit notes are enhanced as it warms, balancing things out a bit. ABV is excellently masked with subtle alcohol sweetness but no heat whatsoever making this pretty quaffable.

Overall, this beer is one of the most interesting trappist beers Ive had. Its well balanced but much hoppier than any Belgian beer(in this style) that I have encountered. The malt and dark fruit notes really start to shine as it warms so I highly recommend drinking it at cellar temperature or letting it warm up considerably to enjoy it at its fullest potential.

2856,"2011-01-14",3.9,"The Trappist monastery at Westvleteren is known for making ""The Greatest Beer in the World"" with their ""12,"" but what about the other beers they brew? Beer nerds tend to gloss over the ""8"" - a dubbel brewed in the traditional Belgian style. While not quite as complex and robust as the 12, this beer is still very impressive for what its able to accomplish.APPEARANCE AND AROMAI poured a 2010 vintage 11.2oz bottle into an authentic Trappist chalice. This beer looks very traditionally Belgian with a dark burgundy color and an extremely hazy body. It forms a small, off-white, soapy head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing.The aroma is akin to a white wine, which is strange considering its dark appearance. There seems to be notes of green apple, red apple, cherry, and a bit of alcohol.TASTEEvery time Ive drank a Trappist beer, the first thing I notice is how similar these beers are to wine in taste and Westvleteren 8 is no exception. Up front I get a strong taste of red wine, followed by a sharp, sour red grape flavor. The finish and aftertaste is cherry, plum, and green apple. There also seems to be a slightly bready component to the palate, giving the beer a bit of a malty sweetness.Usually, beers like this tend to grow more complex and more robust as they warm, but I found this beer stayed about the same from beginning to end. While I did notice quite a few flavors, I was surprised by how little energy comes from this palate. This could be due to the sharp sourness, but once it mellowed out, this beer drank more like a juice. Still, it tasted very good even though its quite different from most beers of  the style Ive experienced.DRINKABILITYBottle-conditioned Trappist beers tend to have a mouthfeel not unlike Pop Rocks candy, but Westvleteren 8 was surprisingly calm. Its only a medium-bodied beer with the liquid feeling slightly thick, but the lack of carbonation and peppery  texture was odd. This should be a sipping beer, but it can be drank in bigger gulps easily.This beer weighs in at 8% ABV, which is actually seems a bit high. There is little alcohol in the nose and next to none in the taste, nor in the constitution. The palate, mouthfeel, and potency all combine for a highly drinkable beer. This would ordinarily be a good thing, but because this beer is so rare and expensive you have to force yourself to savor every sip.FINAL THOUGHTSIm never afraid to say the emperor has no clothes and I think, technically, thats true with Westvleteren 8. Its consistently rated among the best of the best on Rate Beer and Beer Advocate, but I think thats due more to hegemony than true quality. Im sure this beer ages wonderfully and I would definitely like to try an older vintage if I could.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww3P0acK_MA","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

A massive four finger head settles to a creamy, frothy head. Theres an island of foam in the form of a heart. Dark almond body.

Smells softly of concord grapes, brown sugar, toasted nuts, and raisins. Quite luscious. 
Caramel and toasty malts, Belgian candy sugar, and dark fruitiness. This is fairly young and the earthy hops are quite apparent, providing a nice contrast to the sugary, vinous sweetness. The yeast adds a nice spiciness, which comes through most clearly on the finish as clove. Theres the smallest amount of rich booziness. 

Medium and lush. Medium to medium-high carbonation, with a long, slightly dry finish.

Drinkability is killer. I drank my half of the bottle in around ten minutes.

The nose is sweet caramel malt with cola, some earthy yeast, and a fruity aroma that is somewhere between (or a combination of) citrus and red berry.  The flavor starts off the same as the nose with cola and caramel malts, but there is an added vanilla component along with some milk chocolate and very light nuttiness.  The fruitiness is still there, and still just as hard to describe.  There is some bitterness along with the earthy flavor, but they both take a while to come through on the finish.

2856,"2010-11-13",4.8,"Transcription of an old BA review from 01-11-2010, with scores adjusted to RB scale. Will re-rate...someday.

BB on cap is not perfectly readable, however both month & year of expiration are imprinted clearly enough, saying 02. 2011. Assuming that the beer has been bottled 3 years prior to declared expiration date as is the case with 12, it belongs to 2008 vintage and is roughly 2 yrs old by now. Pouring into Rochefort chalice produces tan head transforming itself into thin lacy cap that lasts. Dark coppery brown with dark floaties of yeast.
Almost palpable aromas of sour cherries, dark brown sugar reach on molasses and all kind of berries powdered with cocoa or grated milk chocolate. The flavor profile consists of milk chocolate ice cream with sour cherries & berries and subtle touch of hoppy bitterness that is prolonged into lingering mild bitter aftertaste. Silky smooth, medium bodied nectar with absolutely no alcohol detectable. The smoothest, silkiest beer Ive ever tasted. Perhaps less diversity in aroma/flavor profile than12, without evident vinous component and a bit more pronounced hoppiness, but nevertheless equally good as the big brother.","SLOVENIA","EvilBuddha"

2856,"2010-10-24",4.5,"MY 1500TH RATING!
Location: I got to try this wonderful beer at In de Vrede, August 2010


Aroma: Super complex nose of chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, berries, roasted malts, etc

Appearance: This one pours a really nice looking brown color with a slight red hue

Flavor: The taste is also rather complex, lots of rich malty flavors that are in a nice balance

Palate: It has a full bodied feel, but doesnt sacrifice drinkability, smooth and wonderful finish

Overall Impression: 
This is rating # 1500, so I needed a special one, and, this one obviously fits the bill!  I actually did the Westy 12 as my 1000th rating, but that was the first time I got to try it.  On this trip I got to drink the 8, 12, and Blond, and was able to procure (and bring back to the US with me) a few 12s and a Blond.  Unfortunately, I wasnt able to buy any 8s to go, so this will probably serve as my only sampling of this one for a while.  Anyway, awesome stuff.  It doesnt quite hit the level of the 12, but it is amazing in its own right.  Not much more I can say here, I hope I did this beer justice...","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Fruity notes start to emerge - figs, raisins and maybe a bit of baked banana.  It could be too sweet, but theres just enough roasted malt bitterness to carry it off.  As to the mouthfeel, theres a light prickly fizz at first which soon gives way to a velvet-smooth creamy mouthfeel.

2856,"2010-09-15",4.6,"Bottle @ In De Vrede, Westvleteren. Ive had this beer before, but that was in my pre-RB days. Thus, its a pleasure to rate this beauty in its own ""home"". :-) Like all the beers consumed here this afternoon, Westvleteren 8 is served in proper glassware; a murky dark brown teak-colored body crowned with an elegant, creamy, inch-thick off-white head. Aroma is a classic ""dubbel/strong abbey ale""-blend; raisins, figs, caramel malts and notes of dark candy sugar. The smooth and creamy texture brings out flavors of roasted malts, toffee and hints of bitter hops; particularly in the aftertaste. But, once again, it is not the mere taste of Westvleteren that has made its reputation. Rather, its the composition and mouthfeel - the sweet, symphonic mixture of otherwise known flavors, fused into a higher state of tactile bliss. The Extra 8 is yet another example of this art. Although not as high in caliber as its big brother, the fabled Westy 12, this is a thoroughly well-crafted brew that deserves all the hype bestowed upon its humble, label-less body.

This one was surprising in that I was expecting angels to come soaring out of the bottle based on the reviews on ratebeer and beer advocate --- and it was really similar to the other top shelf Belgian beers.  Ill give it a nod because of the coffee, date, and general maltiness that I wasnt really expecting.  Also, it wasnt as sweet as other abbey ales.   It had  a complext taste which Im finding difficult to describe.  The color was a translucent brown with a medium head that barely stuck to the glass.  Alcohol was present but tempered.

2856,"2010-06-30",4.2,"Appearance: Dark, murky brown - the typical dubbel color, but with exceptionally good head retention. 

Smell: Dry and spicy; plum, fig, black licorice and herbal hops.

Mouthfeel: Extremely smooth on the tongue. Medium-bodied with gentle carbonation. 

Drinkability: The dryness really adds to the drinkability - if not for the rarity I could see myself drinking this often.

I found the Westy to have the most complex aroma and flavor profile, though certainly not the strongest of either.

Bottle ordered and consumed at In De Vrede, the abbey cafe.

Pours a murky brown topped with a creamy and thin ivory head. Leaves sheeting lace on the glass. Smells strongly of dark fruit, vanilla, oak and rich bready malt. Rum-soaked raisins and some squishy-ripe currant in the aroma too.

Just a hint of alcohol in the mouth but a lot more of that raisin and sweet bready maltiness. Yeasty.Prunes and currant, toffee and rich malt.Big and sweet body but still there is a very detectable evidence of persistent herbal hops in the finish.

Its lovely and warming as you drink it. Just as good as its big brother, just enough character to distinguish it from being Westy 12, Jr.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","lagermonkey"

2856,"2010-05-25",4.3,"(Old BA rate - bottle)
Dark tawny brown color with a creamier looking, slightly off-white head. In the aroma, pruney/raisiny maltiness with a bit of alcohol peeking through. Several layers of sweetness involved with candied sugar and a bit of an herbal aroma. Maltiness dominates with the raisin and dark fruit flavors from the aroma really shining in the flavor. Sweek cakiness, toffee, and a little bit of lighter fruit flavors as well. Little touch of peppery alcohol. Medium MF, but I might have expected this to be a little heavier considering the look and overall complexity. It does coat and cover the palate really well, and provided a warming finish. Wonderfully drinkable with the numerous layers of flavor that hit the palate. Even though it is a rich brew, I had no trouble savoring every last bit of it. Overall, I have to say that this lives up to the hype.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"
2856,"2010-05-23",4.1,"2007 Bottle consumed today.

Appearance: Dark amber that gets more brown like as the glass is filled. Soft creamy 2 fingers of light mocha head with medium retention and some lacing. The head is more impressive than the body to me. So soft and lush looking.

Smell: Dark fruits, a touch of caramel, and a touch of toffee. Predominantly dark fruits though.

Taste: Spicy yeast and a mellowed sugar rush to the forefront with dark fruits following. A touch of hops and another touch of caramel come in the finish which is not very drawn out. Fairly clean and very appetizing. A delicious dubbel.

Mouthfeel: Lush carbonation and a well crafted effervescence create a world class mouthfeel. Probably my favorite characteristic of this brew.

Drinkability: One of the smoothest, easiest to drink, 8% ABV beverages that will touch your lips.

It only misses out on a 10 for two reasons, both subjective. 1. I know the 12 is better and have a bottle of that still to have tomorrow, and 2. A 10/10 for me would need hops, and there are none here. It is still an aroma one can lose oneself in. Figgy, nutty, notes of fresh baked datebread waft around in my brandy snifter.

2856,"2010-02-06",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 20, 2011 330mL at In De Vrede and some  courtesy of Travlr. Pours a translucent amber with a thin head. Aroma is bready, yeasty, lots of boozy caramel, brown sugar, dark fruits. The smell from the cap though is completely heavenly and divine. Yum. Flavor is sweet, lots of candi sugar, plums, figs, brown sugar. Pretty good but I would like to try a few more to really see why this beer is so hyped and sought after. 2/6/2010 8/4/8/4/14=3.8330mL 2007 ed  courtesy of Travlr. The pour is similar to Westy 12- almost the same SRM of very dark muddy sepia looking almost black in the glass. A towering, poofy, cinnamon tan head erupts with fierce retention and massive ice cream scoop formation. Never goes away. Nose is spicy, less calvados in the nose compared to the 12, with similar rich milk chocolate, apple butter, and spicy yeast similar to Charlevoix Dominus Vobiscum Double. Taste is sharp, spicy, and mildly tannic with an excellent, full, silky mouthfeel. Sharper and less forgiving in the palate versus the 12 but also extremely delicious. Spiced apple pie comes to mind. Delicious. 7/17/2011 8/5/8/4/16=4.1","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
2856,"2010-01-24",4.5,"Sweet aroma; candy sugar, spices and dry fruit (cherry?). Deep amber-brown with nice off white head; a thin layer remains long after the pour, nice lacing.  Moderately sweet and moderately roasty.  The roasted flavors pursist as the tastes transitions from sweet to lightly earthy-hoppy.  A nice bit of green apple approaching the finish.  Overall very smooth palate.  A pleasant beer, well described as a toned down version of the 12.

Pours a murky brown with a medium sized head that lasts nicely. Aroma is similar to the 12 but more vibrant and bright. It doesnt have the peppery alcohol notes, which is neither good nor bad. I still get the vinous grape smell that comes off as the purple fruit snacks, but its still very enjoyable. Flavor is markedly thinner in mouthfeel than the 12, little alcohol presence, sweet malts, still fairly vinous, but it just doesnt have the body to really make it stand out. The carbonation is soft and the finish is pretty quick.

The best part comes actually after swallowing the goods. A lingering dry bitter finish that makes me wonder what just happened. The flavor is not very strong, just like the aroma, but really well balanced and very nice. But although I really like this beer, it still lacks something.. undefinable.

I had to pause and take all of this in for a moment.  The flavor is first class as well.  There was some consensus with my tasting group that this was even better than the Westy 12 we had tasted earlier.  It has a very sugary caramel maltiness , vinous and port-like, multiple fruits: plum, dates, black cherry, all well integrated with each other.

Taste is the same sweetness with some nice breadiness, toffee, light spice up front, and a bit of vanilla. Finish is lightly hopped--just enough to balance out some of the sweetness. The mouthfeel was just ridiculous--smooth and chewy in the mouth, and the perfect amount of warmth as it goes down the throat. Rated this one identical to the 12.

The smell is of light fruity aromas and plenty of malts - very thick and robust. Notes of fudge and toffee mixed with earthy herbal aromas. Some spicy phenols and alcohol. Rather complex and well balanced, but its not as impressive or as powerful as I had expected.

In the taste, there is a similar balance between fruity aromas and malts as in the smell: cherries, slightly tart red currants rests upon a decent malty backbone. Fudge and caramel delivers much of the sweetness. Dark bread, a gentle note of wood and just a hint of blanket (which I find a bit odd). The finish is slightly phenolic and somewhat bitter with notes of sweet alcohol, herbs and minerals.

Full bodied, smooth texture. The finish is somewhat dry. A very pleasant mouthfeel.

A good beer, very good actually. Complex, well balanced and tasty. But one of the best beers in the world? Perhaps not, in my humble opinion.

The beer pours a murky brown. I had expected a better look. Smell of hops, and a hint of tobacco (as with the blond, though less), burnt grain, raisins. Gives a reasonably good frothy off-white head that does not last however. The beer was a bit too cold when I took the first sips. Result: bitterness protruding that reminded me of the Orval. The taste gets better when the beer warms up. 
Nevertheless I found this one quite thin and watery as far as texture goes. Expected it to be much better. As for the taste nuances, theyre there but all somehow toned down and the beer is therefore lacking in complexity.

The aroma changes and 10minutes in smells like fresh raisins and cough medicine. Very sweet with a syrupy like finish. A good beer, but far from what i was expecting.","USA","sw"
2856,"2009-10-11",4.0,"[bottle--thanks, fonefan!]
Tangy herbal and spice aroma with plenty of dried fruit, banana, clove, brown sugar and faint walnuts. Slightly vinous as well in the nose--almost balsamic. Cloudy, dark reddish brown under an eternal, beige blanket. Sweet, complex flavour that includes figs and dates, raisins and tobacco, almonds and walnuts, coffee and bitter chocolate. The bitterness level is good an almost offsets the sweet flavour. Slightly sugary. Medium body, moderate carbonation, molasses plus slight bitter finish.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"
2856,"2009-10-01",3.8,"Bottle courtesy of a tade with BelgianBeerGal and cracked in honor of my 2 year mark on RateBeer. Cheers! Pours a dark thick brown, opaque in parts and a bit brighter, red, and with some decent light, a nice bigger light brown head that dies to a sufficient level, laces fairly well. Aromas are a deep fruitiness, apples and bananas dance with cherries, brown sugar, bread, caramel, toffee, a touch of spice, vanilla. The fruitiness is prominent, a bit deeper and darker overall, without too much sugar and spiciness, almost a winey aroma in some ways. Initial is a nice full mouthfeel, fruity banana, apple, pear, cherries and pit fruit (light plum and very light raisin), light caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, a bit of Belgian yeast spice on the tounge. A touch boozy, but pleasant enough. A fruity must almost, a decent bitterness on the backend with mellow fruity and malty flavors lingering. A pretty good beer, surprising at 8 ABV, and fairly light on the palate for what it is. Quite quaffable.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Never too sweet, the palate is full and smooth, light carbonation giving the body some pomp while lasting on and on and on. It doesnt have the depth or sweet fruit of the 12, but its damn good.

Malty and citrus aromas with a slight tartness. Dark reddish brown with a rich creamy head.  Flavors are tart dried fruits, bounces around in the mouth with flavor changes.  Dryish on the finish and bitter but with a light balancing sweetness.  Long duration wraps around the tongue.  I assume this was a fairly green bottle and will improve a lot with age.

Ive been waiting a long time to try this gem. Pours a vibrant cherry and ruby red, sienna-tinted and cloudy, with an uneven, rocky straw colored head. Beautiful. The aroma immediately gives away pilsener malt as a base, followed by a perfumy blend of plums, figs, and raisins. A very nice dark fruit complex. A touch sweet and sherry-like with a nice yeast contribution. Flavor develops quickly, with spiced bread pudding and fruitcake characters. The mineral-forward pils malt shows quickly and then slides off into a dappling of black cherry juice, allspice, and cooked plum flesh. Delicious. A very dry and carbonated presentation. Bottle-conditioning at its finest. I think whats most exciting and appealing about this beer is the raging fresh pilsener malt character that just oozes out of ever pore of this beer. The deeper fruit characters and the gentle yeast tones are fantastic, but the pils malt base really sets a stage for excellence. Wonderful.

Appearance : Deep brown with a HUGE foamy off-white head. Rocky fluffy head. Lots of lacing.

Taste : Great brown sugar with yeast and spices. Finish has nice red fruits with herbal hops. Light hints of chocolate. Light bitterness on the finish with a tiny alcohol bite. Carbonation is awesome. Really fluffy but smooth. Persistent spices and hops on the finish.

Overall : Wow this is very good. Ive been slightly disappointed by the last belgians strong Ive had and I was wondering if my palate had evolved away from the style but this one tells me otherwise. Nose is awesome. Amazing yeast with nice hops and light chocolate. Taste is equally good with a nice bitterness on the finish. Overall this is rather dry but with lot of body. Perfect carbonation.

Were talking cappuccino froth. Dark fruits, caramel apples (like honeycrisp apples dipped in real caramel), milk chocolate and spices on the nose. I dont know how they make these brews so creamy while retaining so much carbonation. The palate may be one of the best parts - so silky smooth. Flavors line up with the nose, adding perhaps some grape must. The profile is akin to the 12 but without quite the knockout punch. My favorite part? The flavor lingers forever.

Well balanced flavour with a warm alcoholic bitterness. Delicious fizziness. The taste is a chocolate/coffee background with very subtle hints of fruit... surprisingly nothing much happens in the way of taste development.","NETHERLANDS","Bosskie"

The colour is awsome and pretty much perfect - dark red/brown with an OK light tan cap that looks like melanoma thanks to the shovelful of sediment that cannonballed into the glass. Nice malts and sweet (another grape Hubba Bubba sighting) to the nose with interesting spices....here come the hops!! Very well balanced. Very appealing. Taste is really balanced as well. Raisins, soft warm hops, tasty malts. Its too bad that I just couldnt get more out of the taste. Then I drank a ton of sediment and dammit, it is freaking tasty. Smooth and medium to full bodied with a touch of alcohol and suprisingly little aftertaste. Excellent beer.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Expensive as. Actually gushed out of the bottle, even though it had been sitting out of the fridge for a while. Obviously a lot going on here. A huge fruity nose. Blackcurrants, apple, banana etc. The moutfeel was medium bodied and very fruity. As it warmed up it had more toffee and coffee notes, as well as a pronounced alcohol bite.

The main body of the aroma seems to be made up of what I first thought was sour cherries, but then realized it smells identical to grape huba buba gum. Great balance in the smell not to strong or to weak, the underlying aromas I can detect is of warm alcohol, and sweet yeast, maybe but Im not sure some fruity hops. Nice smooth warming alcohol presence in the flavor, and I want to say this has some red wine like qualities to it but Jeff (Beercronic) wont let me because he says I have no clue what red wine is suppose to taste like, screw him!!! This brew has a red wine like flavor. Defiantly hitting some raisin flavors here and as the beer warms more grape and spicy notes come out. This beer almost has to sweet of a flavor and leaves your mouth fairly dry. This is a great beer not a supper good one just a great one, very enjoyable.""","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","Cirrhosis"

3/26/2009:  Oh man, the aroma on this Westvleteren 8 (blue cap) is awesome.  Sweet, caramel, port, slightly oxidized (not necessarily a bad thing), dates, unknown fruit and dark fruit.  Wow.  The flavor is awesome too!  I hate to say it, but I actually like this more than that Westy 12 that Brad also recently shared.  It has a very sugary caramel maltiness (think KRE 04), vineous and port-like with tons of complex flavors that are so difficult to pick out, including plum?, dates?, black cherry, all accompanied by just the right amount of alcohol and oxidation.

The beer has some nice roasted caramel and fruit notes that I cant get enough of. I have to go back for a few more wiffs before starting to consume the beer.

Immediate impression on the pour is that, like the very best Belgian strongs, this beer is lively and active in a way you might not expect given the style. Unlike its closest kin, Rochefort 8, the Westy has a dry and somewhat smoky element in the aroma that makes it distinctive in addition to complementing the soft fruit and malt notes. A touch boozy in the flavor, but there are some lovely hints of walnut and plum in there along with lighter flavors and a nicely chalky mouthfeel. Great stuff.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

The head lasts a while, dissipating into a film that never quite goes away, and leaves a generous lacing along the way.  Solid malt aroma: molasses and raisins.  Flavor begins like liquid cinnamon toast: a solidly malty backbone offsets overt brown sugar sweetness and cheek-tingling spices, mostly cinnamon.  It becomes fruitier in the middle, somewhat tart, mostly raisins and figs, some orange and booze, which arent so well harmonized with the rest, before becoming roasty on the finish: toast, more sugar, molasses, figs, some coffee.  Long sweet finish.  Medium to full body.  Some mouthfeel elements, warming, effervescence, spicy sensations, continue long after the swallow.  The last gulp is thick with yeasty sediment, a satisfying conclusion.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","noncaloric"

Ap - Rosey-brown with burgundy highlights, splotchy pattern in the head which was also noted in the Blond, small bead, persisitant head, fine lace.

I dont even want to try to deconstruct this beer, its just too good. A very rare 10 for rich, complex yeasty, dark dried-fruit aroma that is almost a bit wild,, a quite rare 5 for the divine carbonation that melts across my palate. Gently spicy, mildly sweet, long dusty finsh. I just could not say enough good things about this one. Stunning.

Revisit 5/17/2014 thanks to Prufrock. Pours a gorgeous glowing copper into a gold-rimmed Westy chalice. The light seems to come from inside rthe beer itself. Easy 5 for appearance. Necetar aroma of peach and apricot and malty honey, an easy 10. Again that hint of wildness that I noted the first time around. Aggressively carbonated, so much so that I might go 4 rather than 5 for palate this time. Gently spiced (with yeast, not added spices), dusty up front, sweeter late. In a world where every other IPA tops 7% ABV, theres an awful lot going on here for 8%. I might have given this a 4.5 or 4.6 this time around but I have little quibble with the original rating and will let it stand for the time being.

2856,"2008-09-01",4.1,"Appearance: Pours a murky, dark brown body with a thin, creamy, beige-colored head.

Smell: Malty, fruit nose smelling of molasses blended with homemade caramel sauce, dark fruits, apple slices, and French vanilla.

Taste: Rich, sweet maltiness tasting of chocolate, caramel, and molasses. Maybe a sprinkle of brown sugar and dark candi sugar, too. Splash of fruity Beaujolais. Flavors of figs and golden raisins and Red Delicious apples. Pass the Baked Alaska!! A touch bready. Slight yeastiness. Rather warming alcohol presence, particularly on the finish. Finishes sweet and resoundingly fruity with a lingering red wine taste.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-high carbonation. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Rich, punchy and packed with a fruitastic estery character, although it lacks the depth of the yellow-capped twelve or the drinkability of the green-capped blonde. Still recommended, though.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Has a unique flavor compared to other Belgian ales.  Palate is awesome...damn near perfect carbonation.  Proof that a beer doesn’t have to be big and overpowering to be world class.

Rich caramel malts, dark fruit, especially raisins, and a nice doughy aroma also.  Flavor is amazing and grows on me with each sip.  Sweet with some fruit tanginess that seems perfectly matched.  Alcohol presence is non-existent.  Great medium bodied feel, lots of carbonation but it doesn’t choke you like some others.  Very drinkable and wonderful.","Alaska, USA","12many"
2856,"2008-08-24",4.6,"three vintage tasting...

bottle BB 7/12/02 by way of hopdog drank exactly 11 years after it was produced! poured a very deep woody brown/rich amber with a super fluffy off white head. the yeast is almost homogenized into the beer. there’s no clumps and no sediment at the bottom of the glass. it’s the palest of the three but has the best head retention. the smell of this made me stutter... so malty and rich, incredibly well oxidized, caramel-y, vanilla, sweetened cream cheese (not in a bad way), golden raisins and brown sugar. it tastes like a really well aged grand cru white burgundy... wood, caramel, malt, cinnamon, yeast, vanilla and a touch of umame. there’s almost no sugar left in it! it finishes so smooth and rich. medium to full bodied, soft, creamy, luscious and velvety but not sticky... insane. 10/5/10/5/20...trump the appearance and this is my first 5.0!

bottle BB 7/9/03 also from hopdog... poured dirty brown with black clumps of yeast and little to no head. smells quite spicy/tingly in the nostrils... wood, grass, cinnamon, cream cheese, chocolate and malt powder. it’s prickly and spicy on the palate as well... quite woody, very fruity/golden raisins, cinnamon toast, astringent bitter yeasty finish along with alcohol vapors. there’s a nice acidity to it that was not present in the 97. mouth feel is prickly (most carbonation of the three) and light. 8/4/9/4/19/4.4

bottle BB 1/9/10 by way of eric or jason (sorry guys i forget these things). either way, i owe you both big time! the darkest brown pour of the three with a beige head. lots of clumpy yeast and spotty lacing. smells like bubble gum and malt liquor yeast... seriously. really floral aroma with notes of spice, caramel and fermenting golden raisins. very spicy on the palate and the sweetest of the three (yet not sweet?). flavors of oxidized red apple, golden raisins, caramel, a little chocolate and a bunch of yeast. quite astringent and bitter hoppy and yeasty finish lingers a long time. incredibly airy mouth feel... a bit sticky and rich but so light. i want to chew it. 7/4/7/5/18/4.1

obviously i enjoy this aged so i’ll score it to reflect that...","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"

Gorgeous chocolate brown pour with a thick foamy tan head which lasts a long time and leaves beautiful lacing on the glass.

It had less of an alcohol presence and I felt that the spices were richer in the 8 due to this.  Aroma is dark plum, cinnamon, candi sugar, sweet malts.

Aroma is very sweet initially with candi sugar and a healthy dose of Belgian yeast in the nose as well.  Dark fruits are also prevalent with a hint of spices on top.

Taste is a more complex version of the nose.  The sweetness is toned down just slightly with caramel and toffee playing a huge role on top of the dark fruits.  Molasses sweetness is there in the background.

Mouthfeel is truly exceptional - the perfect balance of medium to full body and high carbonation.  The tastes just dance all over the tongue.

2856,"2008-06-18",4.7,"Appearance:
Dark brown, pours a nice head that lingers. Not so much as the 12, but definitely a solid head.

Aroma:
The aroma is phenomenal. Im literally getting chills smelling it. Its like a smooth, vanilla bean maltiness with a hint of dark plum/cherry. Its gotta note of bubblegum too it as well. Very similar to the 12 if I recall correctly. Might have to do a side by side with the other bottle.

Flavor:
Hold on, I have to prepare myself mentally..... ok, here I go. First thing that comes is the roast. Not overpowering, but strong and exact... no astringincy, no harshness, almost smokey. Fruitiness is less than in the 12. A solid malt presence, but pretty dry. behind the malt and roast is a string of tart, nut, bubblegum, touch of alcohol and light hop flavor.

Mouthfeel:
Wonderful creaminess, fully carbed

Overall:
Excellent beer, one of the best, but not as good as the 12. The aroma was easily the best part, it was delicious, but the flavor seemed a little seperated. I think it needs age, according to the cap it was bottled pretty recently.... in fact, now that Im looking at it, I think it was bottled 3 weeks ago! Yikes! I just drank it green!

Outstanding esters from the complicated fermentation process along with that incredible dark candi syrup which provides a tapestry of flavours upon the palate.  Far into the experience, wave after wave of deep layers of complexity still make themselves known.  Deep levels of caramelization that dance in and out of your senses along with the delicate aroma of northern European hops help to lend balance.  The finish itself just continues on and on without any indication that it will end.  I find myself basking in an afterglow of an experience I am lucky enough to have experienced on several occasions.  Certainly one of the highest examples of brewing artistry.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"

2856,"2008-04-18",4.2,"Rating #700 Bottle generously donated by theisti toward my continued journey down the rabbit hole. The cap is dated with what looks like ""09.03.11"". Pours a dark brown with a thin beige head that diminishes to a thin skin at the surface. When held to light, it shows reddish-brown highlights and some light sediment as evidence that I might have wanted to pour this bottle a bit more carefully. The nose is a vinous blend of raisin, toffee, light brown sugar, cocoa, and almonds. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium-bodied and silky with a lightly spicy alcohol warmth at the finish. Its a bit thinner than I would have imagined, but its a nice sipper. Toffee, raisins and spicy alcohol dance together with lighter notes of leather and tobacco coming forward in the aftertaste. Exceptionally smooth, all the components of this beer are solid, in their own right, but when they come together the results are definitely greater than the sum of those parts. If it werent so difficult to come by, this would be an excellent beer to keep on-hand for experimentation with various food pairings.

After having the Westy 12 and giving it a perfect 5, I was pumped for this one too, but it left me a little disappointed. Poured into a tulip glass, color was dark brown with some sediment. Aroma not as sweet/strong as the 12. Smelled of caramel, raisin, vanilla, spice. More carbonated than the 12, and Im really not a fan of the high carbonation in some of the Belgian strong ales (like Pannepot). I thought Rochefort 8 was just as good for 1/3 of the price, whereas I much prefered the Westy 12 to the Rochefort 10. Good brew, but wouldnt drop $20/bottle for it.","Virginia, USA","wj94"

I had to buy a bunc of other beer first but the clerk let me in on some which he had hidden behind him on the counter. 8E a bottle is steep for  a weak dollar, but worth it.  

Finally getting the beer is almost more fun than the actual beer itself.  But the beer itself is pretty darned good too. The bottle foamed like crazy when I opened it, which led me to cry when I saw precious Westv being wasted.  Anyway it poured into a trappist glass with a nearly perfect symmetrical head. The color was a pretty dark (but not opaque) brown, visible sediment etc at the bottom. Aroma was a bit of spice more so than anything else.

Minimal, sudsy swaths of lacing slowly droop back into the body.  The nose is divine, showing caramel, candy sugar, figs, vanilla, raisons, and various other indiscernible dark fruits and spices.  The flavor is very good, but falling short of both the aroma, and the mastery that is the taste of the 12.  Candy sugar and caramel again comprise the malt base, with dark fruits, vanilla, cinnamon, and other spices pulling backup duty.  A medium-full, silky smooth body leaves just a hint of sticky residue behind in the mouth.

Modest pour into my Westvleteren goblet (god it feels good to pour a beer into its specific glass) results in a 1.5 finger vanilla head that peaks a millimeter above the rim of the glass. The beer itself is dark brown and quite murky due to some yeast that snuck into the pour. 

I get fig, raisin, sour cherry, chocolate, cocoa, yeast, dough, candi sugar, and probably a lot more on the nose. 

Taste is unbelievable. Every flavor flows into the next with ease and seamlessness. A perfect level of doughy malt flavor sets a foundation upon which cocoa, rum, fig, and cinnamon frolic. I dont see how any other beer could possibly have so many flavors blended with such subtlety and balance. 

I would give mouthfeel a 5.5 if I could. Smooth as the finest silk. The carbonation is absolutely quintessential, end of story.

2856,"2008-01-07",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2008 Almost stouty, yellowy irregular head. Wholemeal and sprucey garden herb hop aroma as exuded by a dry unfiltered german helles , leading into ripe berryish fruit, thick spread choc nuttiness, oak,grass,almond,malt loaf.. Sometimes we just make these aromas up,and sometimes they’re really there, mingled but distinct. What a dribble-making complexity of malts and hops .Big booze, blood and bitterness right from the off, developing a smooth nutty choc bittersweetness, coniferous hops and just a touch of paper/nibbled HB that lets it down. (Krusovice?). Apple strudel and caramel sauce ,Twiglet and hazelnut afters, but always that sting of hop bitterness. This beer is so far removed from the sugary flabbiness of other dark Belgian brews of comparable strength. Only Rochefort really runs it close.What a wonderfully lean,hoppy, savoury dark ale. Worth driving 500 miles for a 6pack. (Original rate-4.1)Pours an almost impenetrable dark mahogany flecked with white. Head is yellowish and dimpled, collapsing into a marbled slick of whirls and clumps. Aroma bitingly sulphurous, yeasty and packed with nutty roasted malt. Raisiny dark fruit devloping as it hits room temperature. Sniffs like a slightly eggy, malt-heavy English cask bitter, with a distinct note of snatch. Flavour initially aggressively bitter but not especially roasty, mellowing into a seductive interplay of bitter chocolate, nuts and the same powerful bittering hops that underpin the Blond and the 12. Quite acidic and dry in the finish. Theres a fair amount of sugar goes into these beers, but it doesnt really come across because the hopping is so robust. Palate characteristically light, but only serving to enhance the beers already dangerous drinkability. Not especially rich or complex, but its the savoury, skillfully uncomplicated pairing of bitter hops and malts that mark this out as a great beer.

Coffee brown, tight thin self-supporting head light beige head. Sweet dark dense malty aroma, apple in this one too (just had the 6/blonde), but differently so. Taste is pleasantly aromatic, a little alcoholic, and therefore winey. Apple and pear flavours, and other esters are carried up the nose by the alcohol and initially fight to dominate. However, a gentle but potent roasted malty body stays in the mouth, some hints of cocoa. The hoppy component is of the sticky dense and almost woody type.

2856,"2007-09-10",4.1,"Compilation of ratings from two bottles, both thanks to Fin! One shared with Fin, Loz and Traci, one just Traci and me. 

Lovely deep orange highlighted brown, substantial sand-colored cap that leaves streaks of lace all over the glass. Woody, earthy aroma, a bit of toasted caramel and a touch of smoke. More sniffing: strawberries, buttered toffee. Bright peppery carbonation fills the mouth, making an interesting contrast with deeply caramelized low-frequency flavors. Strawberry and plum esters, a lingering mineral, leafy caramel finish. 

A few things strike me about this beer: aroma is pretty, but the volume seems really low--in any kind of distracting environment this beer would almost disappear. (A shy beer?) The flavor too, is ultra soft and unassuming. And while I really enjoyed this, I sort of expected something with a bit more impact.

2856,"2007-08-10",3.9,"A tasty beverage for sure!  Poured a hazy brown color with a rich tan head.  Aroma was slightly malty and had slight phenolic character.  Nothing was dominant but as it warmed, the volatiles became more evident and the aromatic complexity deepened to include dried cherries.  Carbonation was on the high end of moderate which gave the beer a rich, persistent head. Falvor was a balance of malt, molasses and dark fruit.   Some ""belgian character"" was evident and evolved as the beer warmed, but was not the dominant flavor.  Like the Blonde, this beer featured an assertive bitterness in the finish which was surprising to me.  Palate was surpringly balanced... a silky, creamy texture cut by the carbonation created a light body while the mouthfeel was quite pleasing, maybe slightly drying but only by a nudge.  Overall, this is a great beer.  99th percentile, not sure, but it did provide me one of the best beer experiences of 2007.","Port Jefferson Station, New York, USA","Aeneas"

The flavour is complexity personified, with roasted malt, chocolate and rich fruit cake flavours jointed by a host of tantalising hints, different in every bottle you drink.

Somewhat similar aroma to the Westy 12, with more emphasis on the sweeter fruit notes, like pear, ginger, butterscotch and banana. Flavor is uniquely complex; great combination of rich malts, more banana, pear and cinnamon notes, candy sugar and Belgian yeast. Then came the familiar Westvleteren-style palate, just like the 12.

Bananas, rum, nutella, chocolate raisins.  Dynamic, nutty finish that slowly whisks away every drop of moisture from the mouth, leaving its sweet and dry glaze to coat the mouth.

12 oz bottle
Brewed 10/06, beatified 06/07
Moderate pour in a chalice and brandy snifter.

Poured a mysterious dark brown with amber red highlights with a moderate somewhat lasting frothy off white head.

Smelt of moderate candi sugar, spices ( cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, anise), dried figs and raisins, doughy yeast.

Flavor was upfront strong sweet candi sugar and sweet dark bread and bitter spices.  Very reminiscent of a warm slice of buttered cinnamon raisin bread or hot cross buns.  On the follow through a buzzing strong bitter grassy hops presence is felt as well as a multitude of spices, with a moderate yeasty kick and sweet bread and caramel flavors on an average to long finish.

Palate was medium bodied, oily to creamy,softly carbonated, lightly astringent and slightly alcoholic.

Overall, this is like the 12 but with a less pronounced alcoholic aspect.  The 8 seemed a bit hoppier too. Great balance again, in depth, strength and length of flavors.  Overall, excellent stuff.  Thank you monks!

So I dug around and purchased a bottle of Westvleteren extra 8 that I found on EBAY - paid 12 pounds for it.   I inexpertly found it quite heavy, vry fruity - plums & cherry.

Rich aromas of sweet dark fruits, toffee, caramel, herbs and spices.

2856,"2007-05-02",4.5,"Dark mahogany body with brisk red hues looks as if it is collapsing upon itself, like a dying star in the moments before a black hole forms. A luscious, creamy beige head rises up from within an aggressively carbonated body. Lacing is bulbous and fully covering what glass was not initially overtaken by the animated nectar. The tension between the frothy carbonation and silken liquid is noticeably forceful, one component trying to overtake the other in an epic battle of ascent and retreat. Lively is a gross understatement. Aromas cascade from the glass in waves. Plums and candy sugar fight for dominance first, in what would turn out to be an epic battle for supremacy. Currants and exotic caramels bounce off one another. Yeast spawned from years of careful and noble cultivation captivates all senses, flavorful before ever reaching willing lips. Roasted malts are luscious and focused on the task at hand: to keep sweet sugars and brutish dark fruits at bay, the task completed admirably. The balance is engrossing. Lighter nuances of pears and figs, hazelnuts and freshly baked bread all just add to the provocative complexity. Alcohol is of no consequence, from afar or upon the first quenching sip. That first sip quickly leads to a hearty gulp, pleasures not often encountered begin to take hold. The bitterness encountered is light yet persistent, gracefully imparting newfound layers of intricacy. Sweet fruits are one and many at once, slowly coming to light in a single file line that parades fastidiously past my tastebuds. Pronounced but soft notes of plums, cherries, raisins and kiwi. Caramel malt and caramelized brown sugar compact the flavor and develop an acute and transcendent fluid motion as the last of the mouthful passes the back of my tongue. The mouthfeel is full, segueing into a dry and robust finish of remarkable length. Caramel lingers on, like small pieces of candy have stowed away for eternity in pockets unseen. A truly amazing experience. Westvleteren completely obliterates all other breweries when elegance is the topic. Beautiful. Not beyond compare, but grace is rarely seen in this capacity.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Taste is less developed fruitiness than the 12, with a touch of sweet toffee in the after and a finish that is slightly tinged with alcohol. Palate is excellent, but doesnt quite - again - hit the echelon of the 12, with a bit more carbonation and a little less rounded smoothness.  Excellent, excellent beer.

Head is medium fluffy soon settles into a moderate lacing. Aroma is simple amazing, strong.  First you get the sweet Belgian yeast molasses/brown sugar/butterscotch but then come these playful light fruity aromas.  I get hints of sweet cherries, some faint citrus a la tangerines.  Even some mild roastiness all the way in the back.  The meld so well and play off of each other nicely. This is really an amazing aroma, no hint of any age on it at all, still vibrant and alive. Taste is similarly malty sweet, the dark plum/raison sweetness starts off, then come in the light fruit aspects, and finish off with a a chocolatey, dark malt, just strong enough but not oer the top sweetness.  Leaves an extremely long and full sweet aftertaste.  the body is nice and full and is greatly counterbalanced with a strong, spritzy carbonation.  The feel is almost syrupy but is adjusted for by a carbonation that tickles the tongue and uvula.  Almost makes one want to pour this beer on vanilla ice cream.

2856,"2006-12-20",4.3,"This one also was sent to me by BA dogfooddog and had a best by date of 18 Feb 2008, making this a little shy of two year old.  The beer poured murky orange brown in color, and was topped with a three finger tall head that simply refused to die.  Needless to say, the lacing was pretty solid around the entire goblet.  Aroma was quite a bit superior to most other Dubbles, which typically underwhelm me with their yeast driven smell.  This one seemed much brighter and fruity in comparison.  The yeast was certainly detectable in a dusty undercurrent, but the overall smell was not dominated by it.  The taste was sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy, but not complex enough to detract from the drinkability.  The primary flavor impression was that of dried cherries with a light coating of chocolate.  There was spicy bite to the flavor, and surprisingly there seemed to a clean bitterness in the dry finish.  Not a hint of the 8% ABV to be found at all.  A superlative Dubbel, which has forever ruined the other more typical examples of the style for me.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Thanks to Cougar for driving this up from Atlanta.  We did a side by side comparison of several top Belgians including both Westys, St Bernardus 12 and Rochfort 10.  This was up there with all of them.  The fact it was almost three years old only made it a more fun experience.  I dont know that I would pay $18 a bottle for this but if it came my way I would not turn it down.  Maybe it is time to start planning a trip to Belgium.
Aroma / Appearance - Cherries, chocolate, raspberries, caramel, malt and honey form a very complex and inviting nose.  I could have sat for an hour taking in all the tempting aromas coming out of my glass.  The body is a caramel dusty brown with a tan head.
Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel is creamy and sweet.  A whole host of flavors unfolded over my palate starting with chocolate, caramel and honey.  From there it took on a fruity tone which finished on a sweet note.  It was a little warming and hot but not over the top.  Overall this was a very solid beer which deserves its place in the Top 25.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

This beer has been in my refrigerator since the day I bought it, which was about 2 years ago.  
The beer pours a dark rusty colored body with a tall tan head. The aroma puts forward delicate hints of chocolate covered apples, malted milk balls, and walnuts. The flavor is more yeasty than I would have estimated its lightly doughy, biscuity, a bit dusty. There is the most minute bitterness in the finish, a hint of lime zest, followed by a cracked black pepper spiciness. The palate is  velvety but also dusty along the edges. 
I sadly was a bit under-whelmed with this beer. Although it was very enjoyable, I was hoping for a transcendent moment that never managed to materialize.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
2856,"2006-11-21",3.9,"The only time we came remotely close to tracking down Westy on-premise was at the very good Afspanning t Waagstuk bar in Antwerpen (e.4.0). Dark reddish brown and thin creamy head with good density. Chunky lacing. Bouquet is quite soft with dark malts but not much else stands out. Palate shows a truckload of balance and intergration to the extent that the beer appears to lose some power. Dark malt flavours pop up again, quite dry, a touch of spice and some aniseed. One would almost assume that beer had quite a bit of bottle age given the impressive level of balance and smoothness.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"

Then we had an even better idea, why not buy a bottle of La Terrible, and add water to it, to bring the ABV down? WOuldnt it be the same thing? Deep chestnut, pours and emits a thin, tight bubbled beige skin. Apples, plums, prunes, fig, pear, and orages give way to spices (cinnamon) and a mildly smoky malt with subtle hops. Ohh my.

Poured a tasting looking dubbel brown with a frothy, foamy off-white head that settled into a thin bubbly lacing, small amount of sticking.

Aromas of plum fruitiness, candied sugar, licorice, toffee and a soft spiciness, a great dubbel nose.

Good steady soft carbonation and a crisp, dry, creamy smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel, just excellent.

A wonderful dubbel taste, plum brandy, coffee and toffee, a touch of licorice, a subtle honey graininess, a very soft herbal tea hoppiness, the alcohol is a bit spicy, like a well made rum, and warming in the palate, and a dry yeasty, malty finish with a little herbal flavor lingering in the palate.

The palate is rich and full on the tongue with some really good caramel and sweet malt, paired with a rum like sweetness, and some earthy/spicy yeast flavor. This beer finishes with more of those complex and delicious flavors up front, the ends with a peppery alcohol burn that lingers. Outstanding beer.

Other smells tha I picked up on where that of brown sugars, malts, and maybe even a little moalasses sweetness coming through.  A lot of thosesame smells came through int he flavor as well.  the flavor also had a great subtle yeast contribution to it that was very welcome.

2856,"2006-09-22",4.7,"Actually found this in an LCBO in Ontario. It was supposed to be a case of Rochefort 8, which in itself is a grand find (thank God most Canadians dont even know what a Rochefort is. My apologies to all my beer geek friends north of the border, eh)? Imagine my surprise when I opened it and found 24 Westy gems inside. The manager apologized profusely; then proceeded to offer me a discount if I was still interested. My God, can you say $2.45 CDN/bottle after the discount? Did I die and go to beer heaven?  

Presentation: .33l brown bottle. Appears to be direct from the source, with no label. Main identifier: a blue cap with the number 8. Poured with love and served in a traditional Westvleteren silver rimmed chalice glass.

Appearance: This beer poured to give a lovely amber hue. A slight hint of yeast on the magnificent white, foamy head, looked like a young womans nipple. The carbonation was nicely evident visually as it bubbled off the sediment.

Smell: Oh...what an aroma! As complex and fruity as anything you could imagine; hints of toffee, clove, fig and raisin gently wafting from the glass. There is also a slight spicy character present in the nose. Adding the portion at the bottom of the bottle imparts a bready character from the yeast.

Taste: Classic Speyside. The initial taste is almost like a good single malt scotch. It is so sweet, but a sophisticated sweet. Not sure what it is; perhaps a fine rye or barley flavor. The malt is there also, more with a presence like bourbon with a slightly burnt tobacco flavor. Very well executed.

Mouthfeel: Superb. Liquid silk; gently coating the tonque and throat. Truly a treat to be sipped and savored.

Overall: A masterpiece. Perhaps not the complexity of the Westy 12; but it does have a few notable characteristics that the 12 does not. I will be hard pressed to ever find such a treasure in the fashion that I did ever again!","New York, USA","chouffe"

2856,"2006-09-19",4.0,"I must say, completing the Westvleteren trinity was a moment of unity Ive rarely experienced before, yet not the experience I had expected or hoped for, even after having fully digested the disenchanting Abt. Deep peat brown in appearance, the liquid ripens to crystalline Bordeaux blush in the light. Beige formations of mountainous foam froth to frame the beautiful dyad in its ovoid fringe. Banana erupts above anything else in the first whiff, then comes peach and apricot, followed by fig and plum, an unexpectedly fruity scent that weds light and dark drupes marvelously. Dark caramel, chestnut honey and a creamy coffee fragrance contribute malty scents to the amalgam. Yet, beyond the complexity lies a noticeable immaturity, something one finds in the wiser Abt, something that pulls together each component to form a unity. What it is, I cannot say, but it appears needed on the palate as well. Flavors are again balanced to an odious degree, so far as to sap the enjoyment of what should be a relish. Red wine, bubble gum, coffee and black pepper are the primary constituents to which a raspberry sweetness is fastened with warmth. The Westvleteren hop profile is prominent in this example too, and for my taste clearly overdone, especially as it combines with the rather caustic carbonation and the long dry coffee aftertaste. Great beer, but not the ecclesiastical achievement to seek first.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Deep, hazy amber/brown color with a thick foamy tan head initially, which settles into a thin layer of tiny bubbles.

Rich fruity and malty aroma with some floral hints, some sweetness, and a slight nuttiness.  Flavors of dried fruits (raisin, plum, cherry), sweet malts, dark candy sugar, molasses, a slight hint of cocoa, some warming alcohol.  Smooth, silky, almost creamy mouthfeel.  The carbonation creates a slight prickliness on the tongue to intensify the experience and deliver the flavors.

Surprisingly weak aroma with sugar, alcohol, dried fruits, spices and berries. Sugar, alcohol, berries, prunes, raisins, spices and chocolate notes in flavor. Full body and a bitter finish with a good deal of alcohol. It probably deserves more than a 4, but it will have to convince me on a later occasion to get a higher rating. I was a little bit disappointed with especially the aroma. Rating: 7-5-8-4-16-4.0.  060801Bottle. A slightly unclear brown beauty, topped by a finger-thick, dense beige head. Dried fruits, some alcohol and cellar, berries, a spiced touch and chocolate in the aroma. The flavor has a little caramel, with lots of dried fruits, a little warming alcohol, hints of cellar, dark berries and plums. Some bitterness brings a kind of balance. Nicely carbonated, warming and full-bodied. The finish has a faint metallic touch, else its pretty much like the initial flavor. And it lasts. A really nice beer, tasteful, relaxing and smooth.

What better way to start the day than with a Westy.  This and 5 other Westys were an amazing gift from my girlfriend.  Hazy dark brown-orange beer with 1"" of off-white mousse on top of it.  Very persistent head that continues to grow, just like in the blonde.  Aroma of ripe plums, some peach, and a very vineous and slightly woody note.  Light orange rind citrus.  Full and unctuous mouthfeel, sweet caramelized wort, soft plummy/jammy fruit with a bit of burnt sugar adding an almost smoky note.  A very herbal/minty flavour runs throughout. Vineous tartness that serves to cut through all of the malty sweetness.  Herbal bitterness and a light astringency that I quite enjoy in this.  As it warms the malts richen and intensify bringing some milk chocolate and heavily toasted grains to the table.  Beautiful lacing all the way down the goblet.

Good, slightly thin but still coating mouthfeel with a surprising amount of hops. What I found interesting was how little this beer had actually evolved.

Very dark colour - root beer hues - very little head but traced all around the surface of the beer with small bubbles. The aroma is not of fruit so much as hops and a bit of caramel with a vanilla overtone. Smooth to drink with a definite hint of toffee. The beer goes best swallowed straight down. The swallow is smooth but leaves a rich aromatic feel in the top of the mouth that seems to mix the taste and smell of the beer into one. This for me is the key to this beer - the flavour and aroma linger as one to my perhaps uneducted palate making it one of the best beers I have ever tasted.   It is a beer that at the end of the bottle you appreciate the alcoholic effects - which at 9.2% are certainly there - but rather than feeling stupoured by it the feeling is exhilirating.","London, ENGLAND","nrdoughty"
2856,"2006-05-06",4.3,"From Bottle, expiration date October 2005.  Nut brown, cloudy pour with a wonderful cherry oak tinge and a velvety layer of off-white head.  Swirling the beer in my snifter glass produces showers of miniature bubbles floating down the sides of my glass.  The aroma is absolutely intense - brandied dates, cinnimon raisin, and brown sugar coated walnuts overwhelm my senses.  Returning back for a second helping brings a dessert course of a caramelly southern pecan pie.  The mouthfeel is surprisingly light relative to the intense bouquet, but still pleasant.  My brain is forced to shift gears upon tasting, as my tongue is flooded with a dry, oaky, vinous texture.  The woody palate is a bit of a contrast to the sugary fruit and nut aromas, but creates a pleasant extra dimension rather than an unusual contradiction.  The finish is of stringy cedar bark with a final smack of brasil nut and a mild corona cigar.  Thanks, Matt!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

2856,"2005-11-15",3.9,"Well I waited some 400 beers since I purchased this to rate it. Lucky to have received a bottle from a carton that Im sure is the first to reach Oz,... and possibly the last! So, a personal thanks to the boys at the International Beer Shop, W. Leederville. Poured into a Rochefort chalice at around cellar temp. (13ºC). Deepest ruby-chestnut brown, quite clear, with a towering, dense tannish head forming straight from the pour. The head remained steadfast in its place and left tracing clumps of congealed foam down the glass as I sipped. Disappointingly soft in aroma, it took a good few minutes for me to pick up notes of dusty cocoa, sherry, soaked bay and basil leaves and other garden herbs; an even softer touch of spicy ginger, and lastly a medicinal tang of fruity-cough medicine. Made up for the lack of aroma in the mouth. Strong and malty, vinous fruit mix on the tongue. Very light in carbonation, medium bodied and smooth like port. It started off with rich chocolate notes adding the only noticeable sweetness, which waned after a few sips to favour dry, dark fruits and herbs. Slightly tart towards the back, with soft fig and prune notes, a little Cab-Sav red wine and drying alcohol which slipped down into the long, fruity and similarly wine-like swallow. Not as complex as I hoped, and true integration of flavours was much needed, but this was still a lovely drop that gave you goosebumps at the thought of its limited brewing numbers and the abbey from which it originates. One I will have to try again on my not-to-distant trip to Europe, in its homeland. An experience beyond the beer!. (33cL, 18/10/07)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Upon sipping, I remark that it must be a trappist.  The mouthfeel and flavor are just fantastically drinkable, flavorful and balanced.  Light carbonation, bits of bitterness and light acidity, with hints of chocolate, anise, hazelnuts and caramelized sugar.  Light raisins and prunes with a hint of chocolatey fudge lingering, along with a delectable yeastiness.  My next notion places it as an Abbey Dubbel, perhaps, or maybe a Belgian Strong.  Somewhere in between, anyways.  It has a restrained flavor, with all of the raisins and light fruits and caramel, I could really see it working as a dubbel.  The yeast is restrained and tastefully done.  Low alcohol apparency, no hops bitterness.  On the end, I also did get a bit of waxy crayons, dont really remember that from the 12, but perhaps it is some yeast dullness.  Really enjoyable, smooth mouthfeel, and just tickles the palate with just the right amount of carbonation.  Thanks so much Olivier!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

A bunch of brown yeasty sludge poured from the bottom. Palate is creamy, slightly dry and incredibly smooth. A bit of alcohol bite is noticed in the flavor. Other flavors are heavy malt & dark fruits. A bit yeasty too. I didnt know if Westy could live up to my lofty expectations but it did without question. This is magnificent.

Dark brown pour with a healthy off-white head that stayed til the end.  There was also a hint of burgandy in the right light.  Wonderful delicate lacing also followed this brew all the way down.  Aroma consisted of raisins, plums, figs, and bread.  Sweet malts and some spices first hit the tastebuds.  These flavors are backed by a healthy dose of dark fruit, bread, and a hint of alcohol.  Perfect silky-smooth mouthfeel... this coated each and every square inch of the mouth.

2856,"2005-06-07",4.2,"Hard to sample with an open mind when a beer carries this big a reputation and youve paid AU$20 to snare a bottle from what might be the only case to reach Australia this year. But here goes...  It poured a teak colour with amber highlights and a towering pillowy head that took an eternity to sag back into the Maudite chalice. (And never entirely disappeared.) Clumpy lacework spackled the glass. The aroma was surprisingly light for the 8% abv and dominated by yeast. The key notes were grape bubblegum, fresh dough, ginger and dark rum. (It sparked a scent memory of the ginger beer I brewed when I was around 12 years old. A couple of bottles blew their caps and sprayed the bedroom cupboard where Id stupidly stored them, so I lived with the smell for months...) Its medium bodied and the mouthfeel is smooth and a little oily, with a terrific afterburn as it slides down the gullet. The finish is dry and spicy. The flavour is initially sweet and malty. Theres plenty of fig-like dark fruit before the peppery alcohol kicks in. Minor criticisms: this sample is arguably too fizzy in the mouth for the style (may have suffered from the journey) and Im not sure it carries its alcohol quite as easily as some of the other Trappist 8s. Nonetheless, this is a remarkable brew and it breaks my heart to think how long it may be before theres an opportunity to try it again... Sob.

Addendum - bottle sample.  Aroma more fruity - sweet cherry/raspberry.  Taste more cherries as well - aging seems to have mellowed out the dried fruit flavor.  A sharp acidic-mild carbonated finish.

Ive had the 12 before, in brugge, and i can say that the 8 is VERY close to being as amazing. this beer smells dusty and fruity, plums and alcohol prevail as they do in most belgian strong ales, and there is also a sweet maltiness and sharpness about this beer, but what is amazing about this beer is the mouthfeel. it is relatively smooth, with myriadd tiny, tasty bubbles that make for a fantastic drinking experience. the appearance is formidalbe as well, this brew is dark, with a good deal of yeast chunks. i tried to avoid them in my poor with some success. the head is minimal, tan, and diminishes quickly, leaving a spotty white surface, with carbonation bubbling up in concentrated points. westy 8 has an aftertaste of ripe fruit, plums, prunes, a fair amount of lemonseed bitterness, and is nicely balanced with warming alcohol. this is a fabulous beer and just thinking about its limited production at a litttle monestary far away in belgium makes it all the better. a special and rare beer that i hope you all will get to experience someday! cheers!","langley, Washington, USA","beerbabybeer"

This nectar pours out a sizable off white head that dissipates slowly.  The color seems to be somewhere between a mahogany and garnet.  The aroma is quick with candy and yeast but also has some dark dried fruitsubtle.  The flavor is very well balanced and integrated.  There is some initial hard candy like flavors that move into prunes and leather.  I also detected some kind of very mild spice (cardamom came to mind).  The finish has some hops.  The aftertaste lingers long, but what you notice most is the gradual warming in your mouth and stomach and smooth coating body.

2856,"2004-12-26",3.2,"UPDATED: OCT 6, 2006 Rating 26/12/2004.  Bottled.  Oh dear, as soon as I poured this (into an Orval glass) I knew things may not have been how they should be.  The beer just stared at me, a dark brown colour, with the only head being that formed just by the action of pouring.  That head just winked at me and sailed away.  The aroma had some plum and raisin notes but also a cardboard like mustiness.  The taste was just beer with a bit of raisin and alcohol, but there was no depth, no complexity, no excitement.  Im marking this as if it were beer X not Westy 8.  No preconceptions.  A really disappointing experience for a Belgian Strong.  Im willing to accept I may have served it too cold, but I allowed it to warm up and nothing happened.  No complexities came through.  Its probably a bad bottle - I dont know (Can you tell Im sad?)  I really will try this beer again, because it owes me that favour.  (5,3,6,3,11) (2.8)  

Rating 06/10/2006.  My second attempt at this beer after my disasterous experience nearly two years ago.  Not served as cold this time.  A dark brown coloured beer with a purple hue and again no head whatsoever.  The aroma is rich with a nice sweet maltiness and good fruits:  plums, raisins, and even a hint of strawberry.  The taste is again fruity but brown fruits.  Peppery notes also and decent alcohol levels.  A long finish and tasty, but really not all that.  Much better than before but still quite unsatisfying and ordinary.  (8,3,7,4,15) (3.7).  Score given is an average of the two ratings.","Wootton, Northampton, Northamptonshire, ENGLAND","maeib"

2856,"2004-12-10",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2006 While the order of ratings dont reflect it this is being sampled after the Zywiec Porter. Excellent in the glass with the port like body and clean creamy head. The nose is a bit muted however but there is a slight peppery suggestion with a raisin edge. The one enduring note here is the alcoholic burst in the taste. It is quite pronounced and actually has a degree of imbalance that does fade with a bit more time in the glass. One aspect of some Belgians I have noticed is that they can have a tendency to be a little asserive just after being poured. These need to be treated with respect and in turn the favour is reciprocated. This is definitely a great beer that reaches heights, but not as much as its big brother.","Potts Point, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA","Sully"

It appears as though it will persist all the way until I finish. Now, for the tasting. definitely some alcohol in the mouth, but it fades quicker. I presume that as this warms even more, the alcohol will subside. Wine tastes are present, with raisins and bold breads. Actually, quite similar to an Impy in a lot of ways.

Light wine stained oak. Nice color. Mostly diminishing head that left very little lacing. Nonetheless, a very good looking beer.

2856,"2004-09-19",3.3,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2004 Almost the same as the 12, but a lighter version. Pours a murky cloudy brown color with a  head that almost instantly settles it on a sheet of just bubbles. The wacky thing is there is hardly any aroma and I was expecting so much more. For as many times Ive had this beer, the flaws are a lot more noticeable when Im paying attention to whats happening in the glass. The taste I dont find anything more than malt which isnt much better than any good doppel. Sweet and candy suger tasting and lacking any real depth. Theres the chocolate raisen taste that Im used to but I dont remember why I like this stuff. Full bodied but too sweet.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"

This beer is a perfect kiss.  Flavors are mild...alcohol, a little raisin and grapey, yeasty...the finish is sweet at first, but fades into an aftertaste that I cant describe...there is something bitter about it (not bitter in the good way)...I have had a weird taste in my mouth all day, so we will chalk it up to that...

I had this beer cellared for quite a while, put it in the fridge and took a nap for 30 minutes...the beer couldnt have been over 53 degrees or so, but when it hit room temp, it was amazing!!

You really get a nice flavor from it.  It tastes kind of malty actually with slight hints of all the fruits. The texture surely is velvet, this has to be the smoothest I have ever had.

2856,"2004-08-26",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 31, 2004 Ahhhh.... so here it is Westy 8,  the less-mighty little brother of the mighty Westy 12. Though, at 8% ABV, its mighty enough for most, myself included. Pours a nice dark burgundy with a frothy pillow of head made of a frothy pillow of large and small bubbles. This head, being less-mighty than some, does diminish to a mighty eigth of a mighty inch that will not go away no matter how much you beg. Well, I dont know for sure since I didnt beg it but I just assume. I dont bow down for any beer even if it is the less-mighty brother of the mighty Westy 12. The aroma is initially mild--sort of dry and bready--but if you coax it with a good swirl or two some pleasant rum raisin notes come on out and say hi. The mouthfeel is wonderful and I think the real reason behind the astronomical scores that these Westy brothers get from so many people--very smooth, soft like cotton with sensual velvet touch of carbonation and a pin-prickly alcohol warmth. Of course, Im refering to the tonguefeel specifically not the entire mouthfeel as I tend to give less attention to the way it feels on, for example, my teeth. In flavor country, you see a lot more action. I would assume this is due to the malty villagers fending off the attack of spicy Belgian yeast barbarians. The malts hold their own but they tire as the temperture rises and eventually give way and become slave to their yeasty overlords. What all of this means to you, the beer drinker, is you end up with a beer thats mighty but not as mighty as its brother, Westy 12. 

As a side note, I would like to thank the good brothers at Westvleteren for giving me the subject matter of what is easily one of the worst and stupidest ratings Ive written in the last several days.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
2856,"2004-08-26",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2005 Pours opaque deep brown with orange hints. Head is first rather large, off-white, well-laced, but diminishes to a thin cover. Sediments are dancing all over the glass. Aroma is an explosive fruity malt and yeast meadow. Tangy fruits are chewy (bubble gum, plums, pears, dates, banana, grapes, watermelon, grapefruit.. name it you have it). Huge malt hides smoky suggestions. Monstruous house yeast offers those chocolate bread characteristics a plenty. Enough complexity to lose yourself in. Incredible smooth rounded mouthfeel, silky texture, easy 5. Contemplative dry balancing bitter finish is very long and bear a small warming alcohol hint. Very worthy, I may prefer it to the 12, it seems better balanced(a bit less yeasty and less fruit juice like), but it could just be lighter. I owe it to myself to compare both side by side someday.  More like roasted beans upon resampling though Ive got to give it to the monks that the flavor range evolves incredibly as the beer seizes room temperature from grape juice when cold to later smokier and meatier malt to the plainer roasty and highly yeasty warm sample.

Not that its not that way with all beers, but when chilled there was a sligth toffeeish aroma w/ tendencies toward diacetyl.  Second whiff is herbal hop and bready and toasty malt.  Very yeasty, then some vinous raisiny and purple grape notes come in as it warms.  Flavor is well balanced, but malty with raisin in the beginning, then hop flavors and lightly bitter in the finish and aftertaste.  Doughy yeast flavor with a little spiciness.  Grape flavor comes in at the finish as well.  Hints of alcohol flavor.  Medium bodied, highly carbonated, and smooth.  Alcohol is barely warming.

2856,"2004-06-17",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2006 Re-Rate.  Bottle, Oud Arsenaal, Antwerpen.  Fluffy, creamy ecru head at 5/8"", continually regenerated by tiny rivulets of bubbles up the side of the glass.  Lacing is uniform with different sized small bubbles, crumbling down to leave an arch of residue and an archipelago of foam beneath.  Smells like baking bread, banana cream, and some faint strawberry cream.  Sweet with noticable warming alcohol in the chest.  Soft carbonation makes a soft foam for a nice mouthfeel.  Some pepper and spice on the alcoholic dry finish.  This is the exact opposite of the Rochefort beers: the mouthfeel is amazing, one of the creamiest, smoothest beers Ive ever had (just like Westy 12).  Flavors are subtle; this is much more about feel and balance.  Very enjoyable, very unique.  7/5/7/5/16

Original Rating.  Bottle into tulip glass.  Unfortunately for the 8, I had it right after the 12.  It couldnt live up to the butressed expectations I had erected for it.  Nevertheless, I dont think it would have fulfilled them even if I were tasting this after Anchor Small Beer.  The aroma was faint, but what I could pick up was hoppy and a bit green.  Frothy head, big, with good lacing and a brown amber color in the glass.  This was bitter from the start, I would say tart, and it knifed into the top of my tounge.  No sweetness.  The carbonation and wateriness were nice and refreshing for a beer this dark, and not what I was expecting.  There were spicy tones on the finish, and I got some noticable burning from the alcohol.  For what this costs per bottle, and for how highly its rated, I would say its a disappointment. 6/5/7/4/14 = 3.6","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

If Im getting lofty, forgive me, please, but know that every word is true..I dont know how they do what they do, but they do! This is the ultimate!
Im joining the cloister, too, if means getting close to beer this fine and lovely!

2856,"2004-04-27",4.6,"Pours a deep auburn with thick but quickly dissipating head. What is left behind in chunky with thick fluffs in spots and nearly nothing in others. Fine little bubbles indicate the carbonation on the edges of the glass. 

Aroma is effervescent with apples, peaches, cherry pie with a yeasty tartness evident. This lively fruity blend is only accentuated by the yeastiness.

Flavor is crisp yet vibrant, alive with fruits, most noteably fresh grapes, apples, peaches, cherries, faint blueberries also. Finish is at first sweet with some sugary alcohol then quite dry leaving me wanting more.

Mouthfeel is slick and the body is fairly light considering the amount of flavour it is conveying, but is in no way watery. Carbonation lightly tickles the tongue.

I personally enjoyed this more than Westy 12. It paired perfectly with the first fresh homemade applesauce of the season!","Champaign, Illinois, USA","jables"

It poured out reddish brown with good carbonation throughout.  The light thin head remained and aromas of wood, fruit, and spice smelled great.  sweet malt, candy sugar and fruit were present with a nice spice finish.  The hop bite was not noticed like in the west #12 and the body is easier to drink than the #12.  I believe westvleteren to be the only triple threat of beers in the world.  Yes, they're that damm good and no one should consider themself a beer connoiseur without trying each one.  These beer set the standards, enough said go out and buy one, no matter what the price.","USA","BIGC"

I tried the Westy 12 almost 2 years ago by trading and didn't really have the palate to appreciate it at the time. This being the 12's little sibling maybe I should have tried this one first. Pours a deep mahogany color with a very thick and creamy light beige head. The foam actually threatened to escape the bottle immediately after opening. The aroma is a nice bouquet of fruit, spice and sweet malt. Rich bodied and on the carbonated side, with a mild blend of dark fruit, malt, caramel, spice and a hint of sweet chocolate. None of the flavors really stands out, instead it is a nice harmony of flavors. The finish is very crisp and lively on the tongue.

Quite a nice sight, as my inscription in the bottom of my Chimay glass sends a winding, twisting column of bubbles towards the thick frothy head.  The head is the color of river foam and clings to the side of the glass like a meringue.  Dry woody aroma with some light chocolatey notes.  Wonderfully thick mouthfeel.  Burnt wood, sweet malt with hop bitterness in the dry finish.  I would have like more bold sweetness and less bitter woodiness (maybe Im asking for a Westvleteren 12).

Lacing appears in fast dripping sheets and leaves behind some larger ink blots. A very thick skim snugs the top during the entire glass. Aroma is a bit subdued but is layered with some nice subtleties with utmost positioning yeastiness thats creating some major fresh yet dried wood characteristics upfront mixed with dirt. Very dry overall with hints of dried, even roasty, lemon, pine, and sugars. Taste has quite a mixture of things within, mostly dryish with some moderate dry wood and dirt mostly. That levels off and intermingling nuances of dried fruits, chocolate notes, and light mild spices fill in adding interesting little delicately refined yeasty layers which all maintains one very incredible smoothness. There's just a small twinge of hops but never is it in control or ever present for long. Its squeezed in there with some of the woodish yeast tones. Overall the flavors are mellowing and mild with very subtle tones and really becomes a treat as it warms. After a while I didn't even realize I was drinking a beer, it seemed more like cold Japanese herbal tea. Smaller chocolate tones appear a wee bit more as it warms with a waffer cookie dryness. Outstanding... very smooth yet thick with a mellowing full mouthfeel and easy-on-the-palate dryness that has a nice carbonation thats not overly lively. One very well put together beer, it went from wood and earthy to slightly fruity and spicy to chocolatey and always stays dry. Quite a nice cup of a tea, I mean glass of beer.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

There's so much going on in the flavor it's hard to describe.  It starts off ultra-smooth, malty with some candy sugar and ripened fruit.  This sensation gives way to a slighty bitter and dry taste, with some bite of carbonation kicking in.  There are hints of fig and oak.  Somewhat vinous.

The flavor is milder then the aroma suggests. However there is still a good deal of complexity and it is interesting to see this in a beer that is this mild. The flavor is very coheasive and it is hard to break apart the element but some of them are a very nice dark fruit with a cider/tea mix coming in behind.

2856,"2003-11-04",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 26, 2004 Sampled March 2004A bready, yeasty aroma emanates from my glass as I pour this murky dark brown beer.  It is topped by a thin light brown head.  The aroma has a typically Belgian spicy (pepper), aroma with a hint of alcohol, and dark fruit (raisin being dominant).  There is a hint of rum in the nose as well.  The taste is dry, dusty and spicy.  The fruit character is almost non-existant.   As the beer warms up, a bit of sweetness becomes apparent.  This beer seems very musty and dusty, for some reason.  Quite complex, with some interesting spiciness that is all over the place; notes of pepper, clove, cummin, cardamom, and all spice.  I actually like this quite a bit, though it really needs to be served on the warm side of cool to really shined. Sampled Spring 2001The offering smelled of dark candied malt accompanied by an appropriately dark brown color.  It tasted quite good, sweetish with complex notes of malt and caramel.  There was an intricate aftertaste that was complemented by a bitterness that was not from hops, but coated all 360° of the back of my mouth.  The bottle, in a tasteful way that ran counter to modern commercial methods, was completely bare except for the bottle cap, which designated the brewery and the title 8°.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Yeasty, bready, and much more like a meal than any beer I know of. Aromas change as it warms up also. The monks got this beer right, as are all of their other offerings. A truly great beer in my book. Wish I could afford a case of it.","","Cobra"

Peppery notes become apparent towards the finish, which is long and lightly malty.

Some sediment in the bottle, but all of it came out when swirled with the last few oz's of beer.  Aroma is citrus orange and grapefruit - and aged bannanas?  Hey, smells like my wooden fruitbowl.  Flavor is woody, barklike, slightly piney, dry, smooth, very drinkable.  Lace is complete and doesn't fall away.  Mmmm, slight alcohol aroma nearing the end, but alcohol completely hidden and never tasted throughout, ooo, apricot and date flavor came through in that latest mouthful.  Very good beer.

RERATED 09-25-04.  A special thanks to Jim Dorsch of Vienna, Virginia (Whole Foods Market) for supplying me a whole case of this fine beer.  This beer is dated ""28.08.06"" and pours (in Westvleteren glass) a dark, dark brown-red liquid with a generous 1.25 inch thick beige head that dissipates slowly leaving a thick film.  Aroma is so spicy and intense it burns my nose - includes fruit, berries, port wine, grapes, plum, malt, yeast.  Flavor is spicy with port wine, malt, etc.  Definitely worthy of its score.  As it warms, this beer also resembles St. Bernardus Abt 12 as Westy 12 did, just with less alcohol.","Franklin, Pennsylvania, USA","roomtempbeer"

Nose: a: chocolate, roasted malts, ripe pears, mocca, some faint hops, summer haystacks and more malt or maltbar; B: sweeter, molasses, something lactic, vintage portwine, hazelnuts [9]. Taste: A: bitter at first! a little bit of hops and lots of roasted/burnt malt. Enormous amount of malt overall, but much less sweetness than expected. Aroma's of walnut peel, black coffee, chicory even; B:
bitter again, but now with a fine, spritzy, acid-like surrounding. Very fruity: dark wine-grapes, hazelnuts, dried plums, figs [9]. Mouthfeel & aftertaste: A: fairly chewy; little carbonation. Lots of lasting bitterness and a little restsugar; B: less dense, impact much more refined, would even be thirst-quenching. In the aftertaste, there is a sweetness in abundant, alcoholic tones [5] Overall: This is THE proof that truly decent beer ought to be aged. A well-made, dense beer is virtually indestructible, and will better and, like this, mellow with the years. The young 8° is a crude, uncut diamond; the old one is a shining brilliant.

The aroma gives you very little insight as to what the beer is all about, it's complexity is so very well refined it surprises the taste buds instead of the nose.

2856,"2003-05-14",4.5,"I wrote way too much for the Rochefort 10, but this is Westy 8...a true honour to drink. I sampled this at 55.8 degrees Farenheit. I'm sure it will rise a bit during the course of this comment and the drink. Good pour, with only the final .5 to 1 ounce giving large sediment. Noticablely thick tan head with the smallest bubbles i've ever seen. Coffee Geeks call this 'microfoam', but we can call it 'microhead'. The colour is dark brown but when you stretch it on the sides, some lighter brown shows through. Where do I start with the smell. If Westy 12 had the best smell i've ever had from a beer, this ranks a close second. Sour apples, candy, tartness and sugar all arise somewhere in the complex aroma. If the aroma is this complex, where does it leave the taste? A mouthful of the beer brings tons of carbonation and a coating, which tastes full of malt. Still some sour fruity tastes caot the inside of the mouth, and the aftertaste is phenominal. The taste is a bit alcoholic, but really only if you think about it. I really liked the aroma, and the taste is just a little too malty to be perfect (for my taste), but the beer is still very well done. I'm glad I got to sample this one, and I definately prefer Westy to Rochefort, even though I've sampled two of the former and only one of the latter. Definately a great beer though!

It started a bit too cold to fully enjoy the flavors, but after it warmed a bit, it was much more enjoyable.  There's so many different flavors, it's hard to isolate them for the rating.  There are, similar to the aroma, hints of fruit, toffee, nuts?, and many others.

Anyway, I detected a smoother and less intense version than the 12.  It had a winelike consistency with more subtle raisin and bready flavors than in the 12.

2856,"2003-02-13",4.5,"This is one hell of a unique beer.  The aroma is like a sweet wine or a mead, very fruity and sweet.  The body is a lovely burnt orange.  There are considerable amounts of floaties, but that's my fault from pouring it.  This has a very tingly, carbonated mouthfeel.  The flavor is mildly sweet, yeasty, with notes of grapes, cherries, spices, bread.....and pez?  The finish is creamy and dry at the same time, if that's possible, with a lingering, candy-like flavor.  This is wonderfully different, but I'm not sure if it's quite worth the 10 bucks for the 11.2 ounce bottle.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
2856,"2003-02-01",4.7,"UPDATED: FEB 17, 2006 (Rating Adjustment)  Holy CRAP man.  The aroma on this brew has to be the best aroma I have ever experienced in a beer.  Goes right to a 10.  Fruity (pear, prune, raisin) , malty and sweet, little alcohol, some caramel, absolutely fantastic.  Much less sedimant in this one as compared to my first go.  Molasses, sweet malts and grapes in the flavor.  Yummy.  A world class brew.



Wow, now I know why this brew is one of the best.  Awesome color of rich, dark orange/brown with great clarity.  Wonderful lingering head with excellent carbonation.  This is how a beer is supposed to look.  Everything was going great until I got to the bottom of the bottle and unsettled the 3/8 inch of sediment in the bottom.  Much more than my fancy.  Not small particles either but rather large chunks  which do not look appealing floating in the paper cup (just kidding).  This does not detract from the flavor, though, which is complex with plenty of malt and slight wine overtones and a tad of alcohol.  Aroma of roasted grain and yeast.  Creamy, smooth finish with a touch of alcohol.  Very smooth drinking and enjoyable.  A beer that ever person should be required to try at least once.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

Beer pours a hazy dark mahogany with a frothy, nicely-lacing light-tan head.  Complex, bready, earthy, even bordering on musty at times, aroma has nice sweet caramel malt and dark fruity notes.  Body still has lots of carbonation and pleasant, sweet, earthy toasted malts with good yeasty balance and a drier finish than I remember.  Always a treat to try this.  Thanks to DaveCooks for the bottle!

2/19/2004: (bottled on 12/7/99) I think this version has aged much more than the previous rating.  Pours a dark ruby brown with a thick, well-lacing off-white head.  Slightly oxidized plum, caramel, and Belgian yeast aroma.  Body has much improved from before, yeilding layers of complexity and sweet toffee-like malt flavor.  Body is very smooth, yet has a good thickness and finishes semi-dry and bitter-sweet, without a hint of alcohol.  This is a truly great Trappist ale.  

12/10/2002: Sweet aroma of dates and grapefruit with a great yeast profile.  Pours a real dark brown with a thick appetizing head.  The body is not nearly as sweet as the head lets on, but there is a good deal of spice.  The palate is a bit too fizzy and carbonated.  It has a slightly oaky bitter finish and conceals its alcohol very well.  Fairly complex, but im surprised this is in the top five beers in the world (well, at least it was when I rated it).","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

Will try them both again soon.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","FastEddie"
2856,"2002-08-25",3.7,"NOTE:  Aroma and flavor are markedly improved when served at room temperature (rating based on room temperature).  The first part of the beer was consumed at ~60F, and it was nearly unpleasant.  There was a malty raisiny aroma.  The flavor was rich, but not very pleasant.  Sweetness was missing and astringency was present.  When it ultimately warmed up, I was drinking a much better beer.  Raisin aroma with rich brandy overtones.  The sweetness finally showed up, although I still might have preferred just a bit more.  Malty and rich, with raisin and caramel most noticeable.  Mild alcohol burn in the aftertaste, and the slightest astringency as well (a shadow of the previous amount).  Its a good beer, but I think Ill need to try it again now that I know how to serve it.  Might want an older beer as well (this was a brand new bottle).","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2856,"2002-08-25",3.7,"Perhaps it goes without saying, but room temperature seems to be the only way to truly enjoy this beer.  When cold, it has a harsh aroma (Aaron says raisins, I say Play Doh -- its sweetly plastic-y with an acridness that I couldnt place but that seemed, to me, reminiscent of Play Doh).  When it warms, the whole thing warms -- the flavor, the aroma, everything.  Its infinitely more pleasant, and more worthy of the scores its gotten.  The color is a reddish-brown of wet terra cotta, and the head pours large and dissipates quickly.  The flavor is rich and smooth with some spiciness (cinnamon and ginger) in it.  It is what I imagine a cider wine or cider liqueuer might taste like (Ive never had anything of the sort).  Its smooth and balanced, gentle and sweet.  A lovely sipping beer.  I only wish that I were enjoying it during winter next to a crackling fire instead of on a nearly 100 degree day in August!","Washington DC, USA","Kathy"

2856,"2002-08-11",4.6,"Bottle brought to me from my Uncle John shipped back from Monks in Philadelphia.  A reddish brown murky color with an off-white laced patchy head. The aroma has a sparkling zest with red vinous fruits (ala Rodenbach), alcohol, lemon, citrus, and grapefruit, but these aromas do not carry over as much into the flavor which is darker and richer than the aroma would suggest.  The Westvleteren 8 is drier than the 12 and has more discernable peppery, banana, and malty flavors in addition to the dark fruits.  I like the aroma of the 8 better than the 12 but everything else is a notch down (but still exceptional).  Medium body and somewhat edgier than the 12 with more carbonation.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"

Bubbles steam up the sides, again much like a coke, but with this beer, the head stays, but forms an odd concave surface as the middle starts to fade, but the outside stay much the same, reinforced by the constant bubbling. Head lacks the creaminess of the 12. Initial flavor is surprisingly realistic cocoa. There was some complexity, but that was the big flavor.

2856,"2002-08-06",4.6,"This beer pours up with a boisterous head comprised of unusually large bubbles, and the lightly tanned foam lingers over the ruby/brown body for what seems like ages, never quite disappearing.  The aroma is not so spicy and yeasty as its big brother, the Westy12.  The flavor, however, is just as spicy, if not quite so full.  The alcohol does not seem to be masked as well as could be desired, though it is far from overpowering.  It does not cause the entire palate to dance and tingle, but it at least gives it a good whirl.  The head sheets the glass as one progresses, leaving behind an intricate tracework.  As it warms, more of the fruits (predominantly raisin and perhaps plum) assert themselves, helping to balance the spices.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","gthank"

2856,"2002-07-29",4.0,"Belgian offering; no label.  Root, vine, cardboard, concord grape, wood, perfumey hop aroma.  Extremely earthy, as if I were digging a hole to plant hops in fresh soil.  Chocolate was not the main theme here.  Schwarzbier-like aroma, also, with subtle hints at raisin.  Although the chocolate cream pie, crust and all, was faintly evident.  Smooth chocolatey mouthfeel and warming alcohol.  Perfectly displayed velvety malts are dominant before blasts of alcohol wipe out the spicy and dry finish.  Finishes very warming, not as sweet as I would have liked, and moderately bitter.  Most comparable to St. Bernardus Abt 12.  Why no vintage date on such an extraordinary and classy beer?","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2856,"2002-07-26",4.9,"No beer is perfect, but this is as close as Ive found--I really preferred this to the 12, actually.  I approached this beer with skepticism, wondering perhaps if the reputation was artificially inflating its standing.  Initially my beer was too cold and, with a suppressed aroma and slightly less chewy texture (than the 12) I thought this was going to disappoint.  But NO!  Once it hit optimum temperature, this was a world beater.  The head, first off, was great fun--something I wish the 12 was capable of producing.  Then, warmer, the palate came to life, being both smooth and lively (and oh so easy to drink!).  The aroma and flavor complexity came to life as well.  It has to be said, it probably isnt as complex or unique as the 12.  In the 8 you can compare this to a lot of doubles/doppels in its flavor components.  The saving grace here over and above those beers (and doppels, I admit, are my favorite style anyway) is that this one perfectly balanced sweetness with bitterness.  There were traces of bitterness and certainly plenty of sweetness.  Just as I thought, if this warms up much more, the bitterness and/or sweetness is going to become too much, it pulled back and never pushed it over the edge.

Appearance: Even more obviously bottle conditioned than the 12, with a big frothy flash head and a great deal of sediment a swirl in the bottom.  Even more fascinaingly live than its cousin, the body electric here.  

Aroma: Resembles another alcoholic beverage more than most beers - I alternate between port and whiskey as I inhale.  Not the rich treasure of the 12 aroma, but close.

Flavor:  A wild climb through flavors with good hazelnut at the base and some hoplike bitters accompanying spices as you go.  Gets sweeter, brown sugary, eventually as the bittering smooths out.

Palate:  Considerably rockier than the 12, though it smooths into a rich, full body.

The beer is the color of old rust, deep reddish brown.  Looks very similar to many barleywines Ive had, definitely very murky (I swirled and poured).  Fine-bubbled but strong head with impressive lacing.  Here we go...  Wow.  Malt flavors are dominant here, and mouthfeel is surprisingly lively.  I can find dark brown sugar, chocolate, apple butter, raisin, and spices here.  This would make a perfect dessert!  There is a spicy, very slightly nutty and nougaty quality to the finish, and there are some hops here at the end, too, albeit not strongly.  Very complex flavor.  Incredibly smooth palate and long malty finish.  Slight warming sensation in my chest from this.  Oohh, this is good beer.  I may have to mail order 12 or so of these and have my friends try it.  I feel this is a beer to be shared, if possible.  Undergoes intriguing changes as it warms.  This is seriously good stuff.

2856,"2002-02-24",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 6, 2004 Wood/wine aroma, dark fruit taste.  That describes about 1% of it.  To learn about the rest, try it yourself.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
2856,"2002-02-17",4.0,"This was a good beer, but nothing in comparison to its rep.  Not close to as good as the 12.  Nice brown color, some yeast, good head.  Great aroma of alcohol and grapes.  Very hoppy for a belgian ale.  Some dark fruit tastes, little woodiness.  Very nicely balanced.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"
2856,"2002-02-12",4.7,"A deep, deep brown color; Head was dense but seemed to fade a bit quickly for the style; Aromas are just too varied to get my puny mind around. Round and fluffy. Heavy raisin followed by hints of anise. Toffee and small bits of caramel. The alcohol is well-hidden. Thick and full mouthfeel. Wonderful palate. A real joy to drink and a pleasure. Havent had the 12 yet, but this was outstanding.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
2856,"2002-02-08",4.3,"To try to describe the aromas and flavor of this bear would require a harddrive bigger than mine. A multiplicity of aromas and flavors to deal with. Heck, it is just a great beer to have as have can!","Marietta, Georgia, USA","brewbandit"
2856,"2002-01-17",4.0,"I must begin by saying that I was not blown away by this beer as I expected I would be.  That being said, I can appreciate the complexities within.  The aroma is hoppy, astringent and slightly metallic.  The flavor has a million different things going on including butterscotch, roasted malt, yeast, chocolate, dark fruits, and hop bitterness.  The beginning and middle are dominated by malt, chocolate and dark fruits and the finish is hoppy and bitter.  The aftertaste is extrordinarily long butterscotch.  The palate is good, but the flavors have some trouble converging in some instances.  For example, the bitter finish does not blend well at all with the long butterscotch aftertaste.  This is a beautiful beer to say the least.  Very deep ruby-brown color with a bone colored head.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

Please excuse my lack of description, as I tried this about a week before my review.  Still recommended, despite a slight disappointment after reading the commentary here.","Philadelphia, USA","Toiletduck"
2856,"2001-12-10",4.5,"Creamy and firm eggshell-brown and persistant foam.  Dark-brown opaque brew, with fine bubbles visible only by holding the abbey trappist glass against a full sunshine background!
At first, subdued aroma, opening to very subtle and fine plum and malt aromas, and ..alcohol.
Intense and balanced malty-licorice flavors, complex and full-bodied but quite dry (not overly alcohol-driven).
Very fine and long in the mouth, with excellent balance, with a slightly bitter ending leaving a long lingering aftertaste.
Top class beer, now lets age some and come back!","Sterrebeek, BELGIUM","Belgik"

2856,"2001-10-12",4.3,"Love this beer.  The aroma is bread-like with yeast and a little malt in the background.  The fruit flavors of plum, raison and apricot appear with caramel.  Great mouthfeel.  Hard to find sometimes in Jersey, but a must-have when I spot it.","trenton, New Jersey, USA","ssurp"

Great malty notes accompanied by fruit and grains, most noticable were plums, oats and wheat. Fizzy on the tongue and yeasty at the finish. Overall an excellent brew.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
2856,"2001-09-15",4.0,"Dark, cloudy brown and full of yeast, with a lush apple, yeast, and malty plum nose.  Following is a a full-bodied, smooth but slightly fizzy body, consisting of malted plum and oat flavors, with an unfortunate amount of yeast flavor in the finish.  Relative to 12 this is disappointing; but then again nothing compares to 12.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
2856,"2001-09-09",5.0,"If I could rate this on a scale of 1-5, this would be a 10. I would leave all my other ratings (forgive me Abbey de Scourmont) where they are. This beer maybe even a bit sexier than the Abt 12 Godfather version. Full of so much passion and decadence, this beer blows every other beer to wayside.  This is the Pax Roman of beers gentlemen and ladies. If you can get it, get as much as you can!!!!!!","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","trappist12"

All those fruit and dried fruit combinations that the seniors have, on a session level. Great.","Mt.Prospect, Illinois, USA","Drew Blood"

A strong beer at around 9%, but still deceptively drinkable.  Not as good as the 12, but still one of the best beers Ive ever had.  God bless those monks!","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
