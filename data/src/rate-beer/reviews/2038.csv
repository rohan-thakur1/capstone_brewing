Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass.  Aromas of big caramel, pear, apple, grape, honey, floral, herbal, clove, pepper, bread, and herbal earthiness.  Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt with fruity/spicy ester notes.  Taste of caramel, pear, apple, grape, honey, bread, floral, herbal, clove, pepper, and herbal earthiness.  Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, honey, bread, floral, herbal, clove, pepper, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit.  Fantastic balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy ester flavors with moderate hop earthiness; and zero cloying flavors after the finish.  Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly slick and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice.  Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish.

Mousse beige clair qui tient à 1 cm, bien floconneuse.
Arômes de malt,candi brun avec touches de cassonade, pointe de noisette et pain

Arrière-bouche sur des céréales et un bon houblon plutôt fleuri.
2ème bouche toujours avec le même côté un peu fumé, et arrière-bouche équilibrée.
La 3ème bouche passe à un goût un peu plus neutre, et le rétro-nez est plutôt caramélisé.
La longueur reste sur le malt caramélisé qui ressort constamment (bière ambrée oblige ).
Levure inexistante. Alcool correct, pas mal progressif.
La finale noffre aucun élan, et on est même proche de linverse...
Bière avec de bons débuts donc, ensuite on stagne et on est à la limite de la descente en
finale. Aspect le plus négatif dune dégustation, comme chacun sait...

2038,"2011-08-11",3.9,"75cl bottle from Lille.  Pours hazy unclear amber, with a thick head which relatively fast stays as a veil on top.  Perhaps the beer was served too cold as it is clearing as it is getting warmer. Never the less it is not a clear beer I have in front of me. The aroma is of caramelized malt, very similar of the aroma beer made with DME (dried malt extract) gets. No hint of hops in the nose.  The taste itself, though, is influenced by hops. Its malt, slight caramel, and bitterness from woody hops (Brewers Gold, I suspect). Its not balanced at all, and makes the taste experience quite strange.  The mouth is full with adequate carbonation.  Overall, it is a lovely rustic beer, but very different from other amber Biere de Garde I have tasted.  Their blond is better, IMO, but if this beer actually is made from pilsner malt only, receiving its color from a very long boil, I am impressed.  But the aroma and taste reminds me of beer made with DME.","SWEDEN","PalCabral"

It pours a copper honey color with a large foamy off-white head. There are plenty of yeasty floaties to be seen. The head stiks nicely and recedes to some decent lacing.

It is skunked unfortunately. Reminds me of a Euro Pale Lager in the smell, skunky with some caramel.

The flavor is better though it is still a bit skunked. It has a nice caramel toffee flavor mixed with some basic malts. It is a basic amber beer.

I have to try it fresher/non light struck next time, hard when they insist on the green bottle.

Pours a golden orange with a fluffy white head and lots of floaty gelatinous material (think Abbaye Des Rocs). Gently earthy, grassy, hop-spicy aromas. The flavor shines. Lovely orange, not c-hop resiny but just nice citrus from the melding of hops, spicy yeast, and a gently sweet malt. Slightly peppery, not as much funk/mustiness/dust as Id expected.

Initial spice character augmented by carbonic acidity , but disipates as carbonation deminishes.  Mouthfeel is medium high to high and carbonation level lightens feel on tongue.

Lightly bitter aftertaste w/ herbal hop flavor.  A bit one dimensional actually flavorwise.  lighter body due to high carbonation, and a dry m/f w/ well hidden alcohol.  This one may need more aging, but it seems a bit light on the complexity scale for a biere de garde.  Not a bad beer, maybe its just my mind, or at least what I think a biere de garde should be.

Sweetness warms into French toast and syrup.  Taste lacks a similar evolution.  Feels dirty and dry.  Earth, wet leaves, and a hint of dark honey.  Band-aid and cardboard.  Dry licks of clove and ground anise toward the finish, where a subtle maple sweetness slowly blossoms.  The barrel casts an imposing shadow, but this provides little nuance beyond the wet wood.

Body is a nice hazy, orangey, coppery, amber color.  Very nice nose with excellent toffee notes and rich caramel as the forefront; toasty notes, doughy yeast, and maybe plum back with a spicy, musty farm presence but quite subdued.  Flavor is more balanced between the rich, malty notes and the other flavors; notes include toffee, bready/doughy yeast, earthy/musty farm character, buttery notes, lightly nutty, fruits of peach and apple, and with a moderately light, but nicely balancing,  bitterness.  A sour note of sour apple flashes across the palate briefly.  Palate is lively, medium-full, somewhat quenching, and round in character with a silky smooth feel.

2038,"2006-09-18",3.8,"Faint champagne apple malts dance from the heavy carbonation of this beaut. Really not getting too much aroma though. Pour of beautiful fired amber, with a rocky ivory head. Flavor is a ridiculous amalgam of sweet full grain flavors, like Ive rarely experienced. Theres a variety of farm-like sweet candy grains and full rounds of light fruits. The malts are especially syrupy feeling, but the beer is in no way cloying. Instead, a gentle swashing of freshly roasted grain husks and tawny edges of apple brandy. Its damn delicious for sure. The yeast character seems subdued to a bready faint existence, despite the omnipresent appearance in the bottle. A smidge of hop dust in the backend draw balanced. I guess overall, Im dissapointed by the lack of aroma, but extremely satisfied with the skillful and delicate malting of this beer. It reaches German standards and is a beer that really lets these malty nuances stand and shout for themselves. Smoother than hell, too.  I could see how people might think this is bland, but they might not have refined palates. Thanks Clark!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

2038,"2005-08-01",4.2,"750 ml bottle into Aventinus glass.  Purchased somewhere in the Denver area.  There was some brown crust around the cap which made me a bit worried about the beer, but I dont think it was infected, since it was dope (or, if it was infected, then I liked this particular cocktail of bacteria).  Medium to large fizzy foam head of a peach hue sits atop an amber orange transluscent beer displaying visible carbonation.  The head mostly diminishes to a thick dusting on top.  Lacing has varied bubble size from uber-tiny to medium-small, quite a big difference even though none of them get large, and its brittle and sudsy, crumbling away quickly.  Malty warm soggy orange peel smell accents a mostly peaches-and-cream aroma.  Theres also some toasted sourdough bread in the aroma.  Very malty mouth, like a gran cru Belgian strong, with a flavor echo of the peaches and cream smell.  This is a very deft blend of soft feel and flavor with intensity, like a warm soft bed in the moments right after you wake up but havent opened your eyes, that feeling that is so tangible and all-encompassing in its gentleness and niceness.  Theres a lemon cream pie flavor in the beginning of the finish with just the hint of creamy acidity, and some nutmeg and other spices that I dont know to give it character.  Incredibly dope beer that Id love to have again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

2038,"2005-02-22",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2007 750mL Blue label bottle sampled 2/19/05 with Mkobes and Maibockaddict.  Pours a brilliant, burnished copper-brass, with deep amber-auburn hues, a very hazy, unfiltered/bottle conditioned body and plentiful tan-specked-white head.  Aroma of deep, rich, earthy hay, lightly cheesy, old hops and loads of yeast funk.  As funky and unique as the aroma was, the flavor is what won me over with this beer.  It starts out with a hugely yeast/cheesey, dough-like flavor, similar to the aroma, with tons of rich honey-wheat-like bread and malt flavor, rich malt sweetness and lightly drying yeast towards the finish.  Caramel, sticky toffee and buttercream all grace the palate as well.  Full body and a  rich flavor that is unrelenting to the last drop.  Low, natural carbonation.  Perhaps just a shade too sweet, but its hard to critique this one.  Fantastic, and a step up in complexity and flavor from my previous favorite (St. Sylvestre Biere nouvelle)  8/5/10/4/19Early-to-mid 2006, 750mL bottle drunk on 11/3/07With about a year and a half of time in the cellar, I dont think this one got any better.  Much less sweeter than I remember it from the last imported batch, and still that farmy, though not funky, character to the yeast.  Not bottle conditioned, but still an immense, long-lasting and fully lacing head.  Unfiltered, however, and you can certainly tell from the texture, which is mostly soft and with some spritziness from the active carbonation.The flavor is both musty and woody, with moderate amounts of minerals and very gentle acidity on the end.  Low bitterness, not surprisingly, at this point, though I dont know if this stuff is that hoppy when fresh.  Musty, but very interesting aroma and a flavor that is full of sweet, chewy graham crackers and sweet dough, with honey and light apples.  Great stuff, with no sign of alcohol and a high drinkability.  Didnt blow me away like it did last time, but its certainly a very stylish beer.

Beautiful deep copper coloured body with lots of visible tiny bubbles and strong tan head that lasts throughout and sticks to the glass. Earthy caramel with dark fruit tones and hints of apples blend nicely with the spicy notes and the perfect balancing bitterness toward the finish.

2038,"2004-10-31",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2012 Great orange-amber body. Eternally lasting 1-inch foam. Very deep aroma although never aggressive. Makes you feels like youre the one who is lucky to study it and not the subject that is lucky to be studied. You are lucky to smell this and must offer proper efforts to grasp that terrific rusty character that is hard to pinpoint, but offers such a subtle earthiness to compensate those wet hay flavours and mild hops that seems to have a german origin as unlikely as it is (styrians?). Rather complex when you dig it with the perfect level of sweetness. Palate is a killer, just the right yeast character, perfectly peaking through the copious rustic flavours (basement, hay, wet cask wood, must etc.) Very dry finish, malty. Delicious, one that has you sucking your tongue afterwards. Highly drinkable, splendid spongy texture, foamy, hiding its high carbonation through an unreal quaffability I must concur with the general opinion that this thrones the bière de garde styleBig props to JPDipso!  I confess I find it a little sweeter than before and slightly less deep in yeastiness. A top BdG, but more of a 4.2-4.3 than a 4.5. I changed my mind again. The last two bottled I drank hit the spot flawlessly. Perfect earthy, deep yeast character pairing extremely well with the sweetish, full bready, gently toasty malts. Adorable and unique balance yet one that varies from bottle to bottle, but always remaining good, a bit like De Dolle or Fantôme in its best years. Rather phenolic/spicy for the genre and this adds another layer of complexity. Very drinkable with its 7% ABV remaining not felt at all. Really, thats pretty much perfect in its style.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

The aroma is sharp and spicy with some herbal notes as well as some malty ones too.  The aroma is a good marriage between malt, hops, and yeast aromatics.  My first impression of the taste is that this definitely hits the spot.  It is light and flavorful, perfect for a hot summer evening.  This has some nice sharp spicy notes that hit the front of my tongue; these are a nice balance to the malty sweetness that is also found in this beer.  The malty sweetness has a depth of flavor, which really contributes to the overall character of this beer.  I get flavor notes that are spicy, herbal, sweet and a certain caramel maltiness.  While I would be hesitant to call this a stellar beer, the integrated flavors really meld very well together.

It almost had a lambic-like sourness in the nose...very hard to describe, heavily acetic. The taste begins with a frontal malt assault complete with roasty toffee and finishes with an astringent and tongue numbing lemony citrus. Light roasts then return and lead to hints of vanilla in the finish. Very earthy beer I must say... a strange balance between sweet and sour, but a very complex and cool journey I must say.

Subsequent glasses add more yeast, and I get hints of pear, lemon, creamyness, waxy crayon, pepper, dust. The more yeast the better. Love the spritzy but creamy feel -- much like a good DuPont but more brutal. Not nearly as refined as other BdGs but exciting and curious for it. I love the biere de garde style. Thanks a bunch and big congrats to Hey_Kevin -- I'm having this to salute his new baby. CHEERS!","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
2038,"2003-07-29",3.7,"pours a deep golden/orangeish color with a huge frothy head. very lively carbonation. aroma and flavor reminds me of grape with woody and metallic notes. also detected a hint of brown sugar.","Davenport, Iowa, USA","igneous1"
2038,"2003-06-29",4.1,"Dark amber with a medium-tan head.  Big bubbles.  Sweet malty caramel flavors.  A grassy, bitter, dry hoppiness to the finish.  Excellent.","Washington DC, USA","jskendzel"
2038,"2003-06-15",3.7,"Very nice Orange colour, beautiful head, vanishing in about 5 minutes. I didnt really like that beer, it is very hoppy and reminded me of tuppers hop pocket ale.","hafnarfjordur, ICELAND","Eirikur"
2038,"2003-06-14",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 21, 2003 looked real good when poured into the glass, a weak aroma to begin with but half in the glass it smells really nice. VERY hoppy beer, nice fruity taste, a bit sour, cant wait to try some other beers in this style... I´ll buy this again, that´s for sure","Reykjavik, ICELAND","haukur"
2038,"2003-06-14",4.0,"This pours a slightly hazy pale amber color with a long lasting frothy head. It has lots of carbonation, but uncharacteristically, add to the drinking experience, rather than distracting from it. It has a slightly thick feel on the tongue with a subtle sweetness. The aroma has a touch of apple in it. In my opinion, this beer has a lot of small & subtle tastes & smells that add up to a very nice beer.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
2038,"2003-05-03",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2003 Aroma bears a vague, sweet fruity character with perhaps some pear and caramel, slight vanilla, yeast, a very green aspect - almost like hay, a light but definite spiciness and very faint wafts of alcohol.  Medium, deep copper color, with a lasting, fine head and very delicate lacing.  Nicely balanced flavor profile, with some muscat grape notes, a very faintly toffeeish sweetness, some slight melon and nut, along with leafy, green, fresh, spicy European hops.  Medium bodied and with a silky smooth palate.  Understated and intriguing.    Surprisingly and pleasantly intoxicating as well!  An exercise in subtlety.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
2038,"2003-03-27",4.0,"Sour apples, cider, floral aroma. Flavor is cidery, floral, and has a touch of sourness. Very well balanced. Very malty for a biere de garde. Very drinkable.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Jake Barnes"
2038,"2003-03-19",4.2,"OK, I typed up this nice review as I sat here drinking this beer 2 days ago. When I sent it, the site went down - and I didn't take notes...I know this much: this is the best Biere de Garde I've had to date. Very aromatic, peppery, fruity. Nice mouthfeel, fairly significant carbonation, but small bead. Great well-balanced beer, with nice earthy farmhouse character. Sorry...can't remember anything else.","Illinois, USA","DavefromChicago"
2038,"2003-03-18",4.0,"Greaty yeasty nose with an alcohol punch - maybe some apples there too. Lovely sparkling amber color and huge tall spongy head. Overall delicate, but very flavorful. Destinct spiciness (cinnamon, pepper) towards the end. Toffee steps forward about mid glass. Very fizzy initially - I found this better as time passed and it became less carbonated. Superb blend of malt, alcohol, and spicy hops.","GERMANY","pivo"
2038,"2003-03-18",4.3,"Great one, has to warm up a little bit, so that all the flavors come through. Nice apple aroma. Amber with a big frothy - long staying head. Fizzy carbonation - which indeed is, as ChimayBabe said, loveley unlike at most of the beers. Fruity apple taste, light bitter note at the end, also malty. Slightly refreshing.","New Jersey, USA","YogiBeera"
2038,"2003-03-18",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2004 Caramel-orange aroma. Slight butterscotch flavor. Malty clover and some minerals. Leafy/buttery aroma. Loved the carbonation. Beautiful foamy head.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
2038,"2003-03-14",4.0,"Slightly sour, citrusy aroma. Very malty body, slightest touch of sourness and some nice light fruit notes. Perfect balance. Toffee malt flavor seems to dominate and is pleasant, although detracts somewhat from the brew's complexity. Perfect balance.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
2038,"2003-03-08",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2003 This one is, quite simply, exceptional.  The aroma is a very nice start, and the look of the beer is nice as well.  Flavor is very soft and deep...quite delicious really!  Great!","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"
2038,"2003-02-25",4.5,"viva la France!  I love this beer mostly because it's from France, such a rare and beautiful find, great French beer...the fine amber body hit my palate like a warm cheese, so smooth and filling...plus, the nutmeg really rubs me the right way, I just love nutmeg","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","jeffwhalen"
2038,"2003-01-26",4.2,"Reddish brown body, moderately carbonated, lightly bottle conditioned.  Amber malt aromas, rye, nutmeg, faint alcoholic heat, floral hops, and that certain farmhouse je ne sais quoi that I can't quite accurately describe, but I love it.  Soft, velvety mouthfeel.  Outstanding balance of rounded malt and spicy hops.  Presents a lovely lingering finish of bitterness mixed with the farmhouse character, which 30 minutes after finishing prompted me to boost my rating a bit.  Although I've only had this and Sans Culottes at this point, this style is quickly becoming one of my favorites.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
2038,"2003-01-20",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2004 Rerate 9/29/04: Pours a rich copper amber with a thick, frothy, and well-lacing off-white head.  Aroma is malty and rich with a touch of butterscotchy oxidation.  Body shows some signs of age, even though I recently purchased this from a store that just got it in.  Still, it has aged fairly well on its strong malt backbone.

1/20/03: Light, clear copper colored with a thin layer of off-white head.  Has a subtle sweet malty aroma that leads into a mellow grainy flavor with a light, well balanced bitterness.  The palate is thin, but has a silky caramel feel to it and a sweet candy-like finish.  This has many of the characteristics of a good doppelbock.  I was quite impressed.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
2038,"2003-01-13",4.4,"Slightly hazy copper color with a creamy head that clings to the glass even as it dissipates.  (I have notice the haze was only a chill haze, and now that the beverage has warmed it is quite a stunning dark topaz gem) Not to offend the French, but this has a real english malt nose, with a mild hopsack and farm yeast aroma.  Caramel malts and more malts in the flavors.  A bit sweet in the start but the spicy hops and alcohol take back the palate and make this a very warming ale.  Malt lingers in the finish.  Quite effervesent, but not the overflowing, big bubbly type.  Very small bubbles that tickle the roof of the mouth and tongue.  Quite smooth almost to a point of feeling thin, but thats really not the case.  This one is a great example of a balanced malty beer.  Hops do not have to rule!","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
2038,"2002-12-06",4.6,"Bright reddish/copper hue, big foamy head with moderately fast dissipation and good lacing.  Nose malty, caramelly, some cherry notes (flander red ale reminder), maybe just a hint of alcohol and ammonia.  Very strong and distinctive.  Flavor is wonderful, with vanilla cream at the very beginning, farmy lambic-type hints creeping in, huge malt, and an extraordinary smoothness just barely pierced by hints of alcohol and spices like cloves and coriander.  Buttery finish.  Absolutely wonderful, with one of the creamiest most quaffable textures Ive ever experienced.  Wish I had more than the one bottle.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2038,"2002-10-01",3.7,"Beautiful color of like amber honey.  The head is full and fluffy upon pouring, but reduces slightly when sitting.  The aroma is very pleasing, but not easy for me to describe.  Sweet malts, a touch of citrus, some spiciness and even of the farm.  Its still a subpar description, but the best I can do.  The beer is light and clean in the mouth.  Again, it is a pleasantly sweet with a touch of spice.  The finish is mild and refreshing.  My first of the style and certainly not to be the last.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
2038,"2002-09-16",4.1,"Biere de Garde is one of my favorite styles, and this is about the best one that I have ever had.  If it was only SLIGHTLY less sweet, this would be in my top ten.  Excellent balance of hops and malt. Very well done, if you can find it, buy it!","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
2038,"2002-09-01",3.4,"Unfortunate green bottling may be responsible for the distinctly skunky aroma I got off this. However, the beer otherwise seemed untouched by this frequently fatal flaw. Light, sweet toffeeish malt flavor with a nice peppery spiciness. Has a good bitter snap to it as well. Eminently quaffable.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
2038,"2002-08-04",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 18, 2004 Far richer malt, more apparent yeast, and softer hops in the aroma in this compared to 3 Monts, IMO. Fabulous nose. Presentation is quite dark. Lasting head as a rim around the glass. Nice soft round palate. Warms up a bit less white-winey than 3 Monts, more rounded and full. I am not a fan of Biere de Gardes, but oh my goodness this is the one to have.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
2038,"2002-08-01",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 22, 2005 Beautiful!Thick glowing amber liquid with off white lasting head.It clings to the glass in a ring all the way to the end.Aroma was extremely chewy caramel,earthy,hearty and short lived spicy/sour hop aromas. Huge clean malt flavors are the showcase here.The hops are barely noticable in finish and eventually just faded away.Replaced with a sweet,winey,alcohol finish.First of its kind for me.Excellent!!Thanks for sharing,Kev!","Evansville, Indiana, USA","raindog"
2038,"2002-08-01",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 17, 2009 Bottle. Head is initially large, frothy, off-white to light brown, mostly lasting. Body is medium amber. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, cookie, toasted bread), lightly hoppy (flowers, apricot), lightly yeasty (cobwebs, basement), with notes of peach, orange peel, autumn leaves, sweet pastries. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Clean and solid.  Drier and more quaffable than I remember from many years ago, but still delightful.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2038,"2002-07-07",4.1,"Deep burnished rust in color; Head was dense, soapy and only slightly darker then eggshell; Nose was musky, hay- tiny hit of hop. Much maltier then usual. Round. Very little of the spice that I am used to in the style. Sweetness emerges at the 1/2 mark.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
2038,"2002-04-22",3.4,"Decent, better than 3 Monts, I think.  Malty, medium copper color.  Tastes like a Belgian Ale, not light like a farmhouse ale.  Worth a try.  From the oldest brewery in France.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
2038,"2002-04-16",4.7,"Huge head that sticks and stays until the last swallow.  Aroma hints at toasted malt, caramel, honey, peanuts, fruit, and a very subtle hint of hops.  Flavors remind me grape jam, chewy malts (like a quality Scottish ale), which showcase their complexities as well as any beer I have tried, bread, and English hops.  The mouthfeel is what will separate this from anything that dares to compete; which is creamy, very chewy, and round.  Tries to finish dry; so balanced, as hops and malt try like heck to outshine one another.  I could go through a case of this in a week.  It would pair mighty fine with many foods as well.  Scored this in Chicago and only bought one.  I highly recommend going to all the trouble it may take to find this delectable treat.  Its gotta be the best Biere de Garde on Earth.    Tantalizing!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2038,"2002-04-11",4.4,"Saved this for a month just so it could be my 200th rating and I was not disappointed!  Initial aromas of nuts and roasted malts before settling into a smooth, deep, doughy malt nose.  This is just jam packed with malt - toffee, bready, and doughy flavors abound before moving into a balanced finish with plenty of spiciness and bitterness offset perfectly by creaminess.
Beautiful deep bronze color with a diminutive head.  A great brew.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"
2038,"2002-01-26",4.1,"Wow thanks to Oakes for the profile of this one which prompted me to not continue passing the biere de gardes up in favor of the lesser belgians.  Wonderful maltiness just improves as the beer warms.  Slight initial metallicness, but that faded quite quickly, leaving back an extremely tasty treat.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
2038,"2002-01-10",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2004 Amber, nice full head and lace. Nose is loaded with sweet malt, hint of honey and light caramel. First thing i noticed was the softness and creaminess of the body. The palate is pure, smooth malt with notes of breadiness. Some hop spicyness with a smidge of alcohol.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
2038,"2001-12-13",3.9,"Amber ale. Nice hop aroma. Good malt body, with long and aromatic final, in which sweetness and hop alternate, like waves. Great.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

2038,"2001-05-04",4.4,"Fiery amber colour with an even, creamy head; smooth malt aroma and palate. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a clinic on malt extraction.  My god these flavours are sublime.  Smooth, slightly spicy, creamy, malt palate. There are very few brewers who are operating at this level.  Armand Theillier, make me some more beers.  Please.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
