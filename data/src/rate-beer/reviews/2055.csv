2055,"2016-04-23",3.8,"Draft locally (also from a bottle). Pours a hazy golden color with a medium sized off white head. The aroma and flavor have the character from the base beer, sweet malts, mild toast, grass, coriander and additional mild spice, some of the lemon peel comes through especially on the nose, mild funk, with some barrel influences, wood, cab barrel, with mild Brett funk, curious to see how this develops with time, interesting.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"

Light-bodied, with medium carbonation and a dry, funky mouthfeel. Nice stuff. Will develop in interesting ways, perhaps.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

2055,"2016-01-29",4.0,"750 ml bottle, label says Batch B002, bottled on 9/19/2015. Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with a couple inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. I like the aroma, the brew smells like coriander, oak, white grapes/wine, and earthiness. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some caramel and mustiness. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, its a bit slick with a good amount of carbonation. But its a soft carbonation so its smooth and goes down pretty easy. I think its drinking good now, but I might have to pick up another bottle if I can find one and see how it ages. Certainly worth trying if youve never had it before. This is the 2nd barrel aged Little Fish brew Ive had, and Ive liked them both so far. $13.99 a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
2055,"2015-10-25",3.6,"On tap at Little Fish for their first bottle sale on 10/24/15. Clear amber pour with a thick off-white head. Aroma of malt, caramel, light spice and funk. Malty and spicy flavor with caramel and yeast esters before a funky finish. Not getting a ton out of the brett and lacto yet. Interested to see what happens in the bottle over 1-2 years.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
2055,"2015-10-25",4.0,"Draft sample at the source. The beer is a darker orange color with a white head of foam. In the aroma I get notes of spices, funk, some musty qualities, and a little bit of floral character. The taste has mild spice and a bit of funk, though the funk is not sour, more of a musty funk. Medium body and medium carbonation. Very tasty. Looking forward to seeing what this beer is like in the future.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
2055,"2015-10-24",3.5,"5oz on tap at the brewery. Kind of a spicy peppery aroma up front, some toffee-caramel malt, mild bit of farmhouse funk. Bit woodsy and earthy. Hazy orange color. Ring of white head. Nice bit of mildly rindy orange citrus. Lighter tartness, mild to moderate bitter, moderate sweet. Mild slick in the body, mild dry in the finish. Sweet mildly caramely malt is a bit noticeable in the flavor. The bacteria doesnt seem to have done too much yet, but its presence is noticeable in a satisfying way. Well-balanced BA funky biere de garde.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
