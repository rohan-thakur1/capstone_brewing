A decent nightcap shows that even Surly cannot nail it every time. Surly knows their hops but this style seems to slip through the cracks. Instead of a solid experience it delivers a profile that feels ""meh"" at best.

Aroma / Appearance - Chestnut liquid swirls as if heavily steeped Earl Gray tea had been left to cool. Dry sweet malts, chocolate, and a hint of anise feel true the style but something just does not excite the way that most Surly beers do.

Flavor / Palate - Velvety smooth and very drinkable, it does not demonstrate any glaring flaws other than that it tastes exactly like an average Scottish / Scotch ale should. The sweetness could be more refined as it passes from lips to throat. It is hard to pin down what exactly makes it that way because it seems with a small tweak this could be a true gem.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pours a beautiful mahogany color with a good head and nice lacing on the glass.

The flavor is a touch sweet with a little bit of alcohol character, some candied apple, some light bitterness, and a mild bit of caramel. 

Its not a beer that would knock it out of the park with most beer geeks, but I find myself drinking it on the regular as a nice flavorful, easy drinking, session beer (ok its a little strong for that designation, but whatever)","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
