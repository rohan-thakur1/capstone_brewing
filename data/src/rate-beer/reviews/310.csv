Alcohol is quite apparent which is a bummer, really. Some dirty melons in the finish. Body is medium, carbonation moderate and mouthfeel is indeed fluffy. Not sure whats wrong with my palate but I feel this could be toned down one or two notches for bitterness/alcohol and could use a juicier mouthfeel.

This most recent batch had a good haziness but nothing intense. Head is large and very well-retained, of white color. The body is a maize-golden with a bright copper-blonde hue.Citrus in the nose of the orange juice variety (not white grapefruit or intense lemon) but mixing with the base malt to give the distinct juiciness of this ""style"". Bright, tangy, juicy and with plentiful mango-kiwi-pineapple. Some melon lingers nicely on the finish, with bits of lime and honey. Hugely aromatic, as Tree House beers almost always are, with no flaw/alcohol/resin/punchiness.Sweeter in the mouth, than many of Tree Houses beers, though not to say too sweet. Its soft and malty with a tight carbonation, tons of tropical-juicy fruits and an appropriate, balancing bitterness that isnt aggressive/resinous. As it warms and breathes, I get the same very distinct watermelon/honeydew melon/pommelo or what have you, note that is quite enticing and found in the other Julius variants. Juicy, lush, malty, lightly bitter and exquisitely flavorful and bright. While I think theyve gone on to produce some more innovative and exciting things since their early days when this beer reigned supreme, its still a classic and a beer Im always VERY happy to drink whenever given the chance.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

This was poured into a becher pint glass.
The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a lasting one finger white foamy head. Slow dissipation. Thin white speckled lacing.
The aroma proceeds to sweet portions of citrus and tropical fruits while allowing a nice subtle crisp resin fresh backbone (in the malt?), seems like to me that the resin in the malt part?, hmmm, interesting.
The flavor brings together the hops and the malts to blend fantastically allowing a burst of juicyiness in the full flavor and sliding into the aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a spectacular sessionability about it. Carbonation seems spot on for the style to allow the bitterness bite down on a great amount of harshness hitting my tongue.

310,"2016-05-24",4.1,"Can. Completely opaque carrot-orange with a frothy white cap. Aroma has several layers to itfirst fresh grass; then bright citrus peel; then orange marmalade on oyster crackers and toast; then deep, sticky resins. Its a compact nose that takes some work to ply apart. The flavor kicks off with tangerine juice and a splash of sweet mango and pineapple, with grapefruit pith edging in toward the clean, even finish. Lingering juicelike tang. Bitterness is moderate, never stepping in front of the rich hop juiciness. Soft, pillowy medium body is a delight. Deserving of every bit of praise it gets.","","PartyFowle"

310,"2016-02-19",4.1,"Boundary-pushing and pretty unbelievable, this beer definitely challenges what an IPA can be. Theres an insane amount of sticky, juicy hop aroma and flavor packed into the can, and the not-so-subtle reference to orange juice is pretty spot-on -- it smells and tastes like oranges. Its somewhere between hazy and cloudy, theres only the smallest amount of bitterness, and the mouthfeel is pretty creamy and smooth.

Maybe a hint of spice near the finish with restrained bitterness. Mild astringency and grassiness.

Aromas are of peach, mango and papaya and cantaloupe but the aromas are on the light side compared to the flavor. Holy juice bomb! Tasted like melon and papaya juice. The flavors they get out of the hops are just nuts. Dare I say its too much? By the end of the 8oz I had, my palate had had enough of the crazy melon flavor and wanted to be cleaned up. Still amazing and worth a try. Very different.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Art"

Nose is thick yeast (same as the others) with some peach, orange & onion hops, dank. Most bitter one, big yeast dominates with some orange, peach, onion, orange. Yeast smoothie body.

Je me suis finalement tourné vers le forum déchanges de Ratebeer et je suis tombé sur un bon samaritain qui est allé men chercher contre quelques DIPA de LTM. Thanks FooFaa!
Alors la Julius, une IPA au visuel marécageux surmontée dun nuage de mousse tenace dont la dentelle lascive adhère aux parois du verre, est considérée comme une des meilleures au monde dans le style.
Dès louverture de la canette, un déchaînement houblonné perfore les voies nasales dune bonne rasade de fruits tropicaux, de mangue, de pêche et dorange sanguine. Un véritable jus de fruits, tout simplement.
Cette sensation juteuse est décuplée en bouche par une texture collante et moelleuse. Toujours aucun support dune céréale quelconque ou presque. Je goûte du melon deau. Du melon au miel même. De lananas. Une parade de fruits divers se promènent sur mon palais. Cest incroyable, jen perds mes mots.

Smells utmost juicy, of lime infused orange lemonade and an intriguing amount of grass. The aromas are very focused on the beers juiciness, which makes it perfect for a warmer day, revealing peach pulp among a pleasant dankness.

Has a soft mouthfeel till the end, in which a lively, very bubbly carbonation creates an outstanding refreshment, coating up a distinct hoppiness. 

Tastes of a soft fruitiness, entangled in dough whitebread malts, inviting the palate to a fantastic, soft mouthfeel. Its initial softness turns into a pleasant dank flavor, revealing wet grass, amped up by unripe orange peel and tangerine pulp. The malts then develop a natural sweetness, resulting from ripe orange, balanced by crisp lemon peel. Finishes with an outstandingly pleasant, exotic, fruitiness, sparkly carbonation and fitting, well pronounced maltiness which doesnt turn too sweet at no point.

Stunning, extreme rich, exuberant taste profile, leaving no desire unfullfilled as for what to expect from an ipa.

Nose is juicy citrus, quite dry, light mango and guava with a big splash of grapefruit. Flavor is similar..very green at this point still. Hard to tell if it is falling off or still too green.

I think I held onto the last one way too long before and it must have turned and fallen way off. Pour was orange and cloudy with a fluffy white head with lacing left on the glass. Aroma bursts out with tons of orange, peach, mango, passion fruit notes. Quite wonderful. Flavor follows the nose with tons of juicy fruits and a very lovely bitter bite to it. This reminded me of the Curiosity 22 I had recently, except I liked this a little better. What a difference a fresh can makes from my first impression. Medium body, a sticky texture, bubbly carbonation, and a bitter bite to end. Superb! Original rating started here and Ill leave for reference......................................... #400 for me! Sadly, it was a letdown of a beer I really hyped :(
Aroma was decent with citrus and tropical fruits, but a sweet maltiness was present, which I knew was a bad sign (at least for me, we all have different tastes and preferences). Flavor was very malty, sweet, orange, and had an apple juice taste. Not much as far as hop flavor stood out. This can was from the release before the recent 6-12 one. From my calulation that is only around one month. Im kind of shocked that it would have already fallen off in that short window.

The flavor has more greenness to it, blending grasses and dandelion into the juicy citrus acids of the new world hops. It has all the hallmarks of the nouveaux version of the style, with super bright fruits, distant though ample malts, and brittle, drying yeast texture. Still, in the minutiae of details there is a bothersome slick sugar component to this, reminiscent of caramel or crystal malt. 

This is enough to quietly taint the generally austerely clean texture here, leaving the thinnest film of bittersweet tea-colored sugar to coat the mouth; the important distinction here is that this is the only limitation of this otherwise brilliant example.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

310,"2014-08-30",4.4,"Big thanks to Deuane for cracking this growler open at Campground Brewdown.


A - Pours hazy peach orange with a beautiful one and a half finger tall white head, quickly dissipating down to a thin white film, leaving sticky webs of lace on the sides of the glass.


S - Smells of freshly zested tropical fruit, a whole field worth of fresh cut grass, sticky pine resin and some mild caramel sweetness. The hops are so strong but not totally over the top. 


T - Starts off much more balanced than the nose. The piney, grassy, tropical fruit hop punch is there in spades but the slightly sweet caramel malt is there to hold it in check for the most part. The finish is nearly identical but the bitterness does eventually win out, leaving the palate quite dry.


M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, hoppy feel with plenty of dryness backing it up. The hops meld amazingly well with the base grain.


O - One of the better IPAs I have had in recent memory. The hops are intense and yet they dont destroy the palate. Now that I have friends in the area I am really looking forward to visiting them in the near future to try all these beers on-tap.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

310,"2014-07-26",4.4,"Thanks, jlindros. The beer is bright orangey gold in color. Its quite hazy, which I rather like for an IPA.. Not that I really dislike clear IPAs. Eh. The head is white and fairly vigorous for a growler pour. Lots of lacing. Good retention. Even after a few minutes and many sips, theres still a solid coating of bubbles on top. The aroma is massively juicy and full of hop flavor. Citrus for days. I remember reading BuckeyeNation use the term ""electric tangerine"" in a review; that would be a very apt descriptor for this beer. It smells like tangerine juice with a healthy shot of lime. Theres also pineapple, kiwi, raspberry, grapefruit and pine. Its like a wonderful citrus drink spiked with a tropical fruit background. Mouthwatering stuff. Little malt presence, which is just fine with me. Taste is similarly big on juicy hop flavors. Pale malt sweetness is well in the background. Tangerine, grapefruit and lime hoppiness dominates with tropical fruits providing highlights. Moderate bitterness. Fairly dry. Tangerine rind finish. Extremely easy to drink. Light, pleasant feel. Seems like normal carbonation. Some hop oiliness. Each sip makes me want more. I feel a bit bad not sharing this growler, but Im also glad that I didnt.

Grapefruit zest and grassy hop resins whirl within this IPAs honey coulis, building a tasty example of the style.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam sits atop the misty blond.
-Mouthfeel is slick and perhaps too softly carbonated. 
-This one didnt feel as vibrant as the superb Tornado growler we had picked up on the same day. Not sure if its a recipe or freshness issue.
-Cant wait to get a pint of this on tap at their bigger and badder brewery!

310,"2013-05-26",4.2,"Growler from wolf.... Straight from the brewery. Hazy orange in color, small head... Smells great... Nose of oranges, apple juice. Taste is even better. Oranges, mango, grapefruit, citrus, pines notes with a great hoppiness without being super bitter. Creamsicle taste.... Body is light, but you can tell its unfiltered. Really is easy to drink. Thanks to wolf!","Newark, Delaware, USA","GMCC2181"

Such a great IPA one of the best ive had. This was a non pressurefilled growler that held up very nice despite its travel to Sweden. Wish i could drink this everyday.","SWEDEN","fredrik_"

310,"2013-05-04",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2014 750 growler in a tulip.  Pours cloudy orange with a lacy, off-white head.  Aroma of citrusy and fruity hops, some fruits, caramel malts, and light bubblegum.  Flavor the same with a citrusy hoppiness throughout.  Average texture.  A pretty good beer.
Edit: Upon further analysis, the hop profile of this beer really stands out and is unique compared to a lot of other beers.  Edit 2: Keeps getting better.  One of the best single IPAs.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"

310,"2013-04-30",4.5,"I no longer rate, but this time I am making an exception at the request of a friend who sent me the growler, simply saying that ""Julius is the Truth""

I have had a lot of IPAs before and must say that this one goes down as one of the most enjoyable that I have had in quite some time. The smell is killer, loads of tropical fruit with peach and mango at the forefront, followed by a very subtle light caramel sweetness. It was a cloudy gold and poured a puffy white head with good retention. The taste was incredibly fruity and drinkable. Dominantly citrusy will a very mild bitterness and sweetness from the malt. Maybe its a personal preference but I love drinking tropical fruit salads like this. The body was equally as impressive as it was soft and full.

I can honestly say that after having this beer Julius is the Truth. I did not go in with any expectations, but left wanting more and wishing that the glass would never end.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","mikey711"
310,"2013-04-28",3.9,"Pours a slightly cloudy orange/straw color with small white head.  Aroma is grapefruit, resin, mango, fresh grass, and peaches.  Smells amazing and raises the hype.  Taste falls a little short of expectations allthough it is indeed very good.  Flavor is tropical and resiny but slightly watery and lacking a little bit of depth of flavor.  Thoroughly enjoyed this easy drinker but I like Sap a lot more.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
310,"2013-04-27",4.6,"Hazy orange tinged with pink, white lacing; looks like grapefruit juice. Aroma is fresh grapefruit, orange, and mango. Initial sweetness gives way to resin bitterness. Crisp, light-bodied, and refreshing. Clean bitter finish with traces of alcohol presence. Reminiscent of Hill Farmstead IPAs.","California, USA","Ataraxia"

Wow..... Thanks Eric for grabbing me this growler.  I didnt expect much but needless to say, I am blown away.

Nose was grapefruit and resin

Poured a peachy amber color with three finger head.. very little lacing.  Taste followed the nose, very citric countered by the sweetness of stone fruit.  Peach and nectarines produced one of the juiciest IPAs I have tasted.., resin and pine.  This growler reminds me of the beauty societiy and solitude #5 brought to the table.  

Simple yet well refined.  Cant wait to try more from this brewery","NYC, New York, USA","Godofthecellar"
310,"2013-03-10",4.6,"Pour from a 64 oz counter pressure filled growler into a Treehouse tulip glass. The beer was kegged this morning so an IPA doesnt get much fresher than this. 

A - Unfiltered IPA porn. This beer pours a gorgeous hazy peach/orange body. Super hazy and holding it up to the light just illuminates that perfect color. Three fingers of an off-white head with sticky lacing and long lasting retention. Thick edging sticks around the whole time. I cant imagine a beer looking any better than this.

S - I had a few pours of this earlier and saved half of it to properly review later. When I reopened the growler I got a release of carbonation and with it a blast of rich and sweet tropical notes. In the glass I get layers of bitter grapefruit, sweet yet under ripe peaches, mango, and a faint touch of biscuits.

T - A rather unique hop profile that really makes itself stand out from other IPAs. Bitter grapefruit lead into super sweet concentrated peach juice. Its almost tropical, but the level of sweetness really points toward a peach or apricot for me. Finishes with a touch of clean crackers and a quick hit of bitterness. It starts off being very concentrated, juicy, and sweet but it quickly transitions into a very clean and refreshing finish.

M - Medium bodied with a nice level of carbonation. The level of bitterness is just perfect here, quick and intense but fades away pleasantly. Crazy drinkable.

O - For a beer that is being brewed out of a shed in a guys front yard in Central Massachusetts...this is just fucking phenomenal stuff. Totally impressed and left wishing I had purchased many, many more growlers of this. The next Hill Farmstead? Probably not. But I am very lucky to have this place so close to me.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"
