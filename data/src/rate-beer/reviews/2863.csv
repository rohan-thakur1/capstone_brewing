Flavor is likewise, but with the occasional tobacco note. Semi-sweet, full in body, and the alcohol provides a warmth without being hot best describes the palate. Besides being nit-picky, there is really nothing wrong with this beer. It is one of beers that define the Belgian quad style.

Vierte en color castaño más bien oscuro y aspecto transparente y casi brillante una vez que la espuma desaparece y la cerveza se ""calma"". Espuma generosa de color vainilla, burbuja grande y persistencia media.

De intensidad media en nariz, casi con seguridad debido a que la saqué demasiado tarde del frigo. Notas de dátiles, florales y algunas frescas con un punto como de colonia francamente agradable. A continuación salen notas leñosas y de plátano muy maduro. Hay un punto alcohólico muy suave, aunque nada para lo que cabría esperar de una cerveza de 10°. Compleja en nariz.

De entre los sabores básicos destaca el dulce, acompañado de un amargo ligeramente astringente y de un punto salado. Un conjunto muy equilibrado.

Gran cuerpo y textura espumosa y aterciopelada. Tampoco aquí se perciben los 10° de alcohol (tan sólo se dejan sentir muy al fondo y de una forma más fresca que cálida). Buena persistencia en boca, manteniendo siempre el equilibrio comentado antes y la preponderancia del dulce y sin llegar jamás a hacerse pesada.

Una cerveza de trago medio en cuanto a sensaciones y corto en cuanto a alcohol. El dulzor está muy bien equilibrado por la astringencia suave del amargo, aportándole una gran bebestibilidad para ser una cerveza de 10°.

I gently pour dark red brown I did include the yeast in so it's a little cloudy, there's a one finger faun tight head - considering it is a 10% ABV it certainly lasted the course 

Nose a little yeasty and dark fruit and nodding towards a burnt caramel 

Mouthfeel is luxuriantly lush with a slow and easy liveliness 

The flavours are surprisingly understated to begin with so I decide to let the beer breath a little. This wasn't an exercise in futility and the flavours flourished. Those plumb, raisins and caramel are beautifully balanced with a little bitterness, maybe it's just ambiance of the evening but is that apple pie and cinnamon?

A little foggy dark brown with a large beautiful creamy head. 

A sweet ale, but the bitterness is the most prominent of the flavors. Also it has some sourness to it, but thats not a bad thing in an ale like this.

A thick ale that stings a little because of the alcohol, but the carbonation isnt that prominent which makes it feel a bit stale in the mouth. Since its a thick ale I would prefer it to be a little more lively. I would also appreciate more length in the finish considering this to be a quad.

Dark with a full, ivory-colored head. It has a fruity aroma, full of complex flavours and excels because of its long bittersweet finish with a hoppy bite. Worldwide seen as one of the best beers in the world. It’s a very balanced beer, with a full-bodied taste and a perfect equilibrium between malty, bitter, and sweet. One of the original recipes from the days of license-brewing for the Trappist monks of Westvleteren.

Flavour: Medium-light licorice, bready. Medium bitterness. As it warms up, it becomes a soy like flavour, with some banana notes in the background. Dry finish with lingering alcoholic heat and licorice.

2863,"2015-12-15",3.7,"Pours an ember-brown color, with a fluffy, big head, collapsing to a spider web lacing.

Smells of warmed walnut shell among molasses and bakers chocolate. The aromas reveal a hot peak within a profound rock sugar coating, getting wrapped up by moldy earth and mellowed toffee. Its nutty qualities are distinguishable in the most pleasant way, featuring a spicy cardamon note, together with freshly cracked walnuts and heated chestnut, blending perfectly into earthy malts.

Has a lower carbonation, while the mouthfeel is surprisingly thin till the finish, in which its rich maltiness unfolds its true potential.

Begins with rock sugar from the very beginning, balanced by dusty earth and walnut. A watery quality evolves, going along with the malts, while the flavors do not change at all until after the swallow. A warming spice punch becomes detectable out of nowhere, while the initial rock sugar quality returns in an alcohol soaked fashion, balanced by bakers chocolate and licorice. Dried orange peel, spruce and clove add depth to rock sugar and molasses, while the beer finishes clean, with a gentle bitterness of matured hops and dough bread.

This one I kept in the cellar for about a year, in hopes of this might be smoothing out a bit. While its maltiness doubtlessly is well accentuated, there is not much going on, apart from an overly pungent, boozy sugar quality. For being recognizably full-bodied, its mouthfeel is a bit too thin for me, especially when compared to a stout in the same abv region. Its finish is highly recommendable though, exhibiting lots of different flavors, mostly evolving from the onnipresent malts or complimenting them, creating a nice, warming depth.","GERMANY","aleigator"

2863,"2015-11-14",3.9,"While Ive had their Christmas Ale, this is my first ever try of their ABT 12. My expectations were fairly high, and I dont think they were quite met. It looks the part, with its muddy brown body, with reddish hi-lights in the glass. 
The nose however is a letdown, with a hint of bready malts, and some dark fruit peels.
The palate is surprisingly on the tingly crisp side, and not velvety smooth like I was expecting. Still interesting though.
The tastes are concentrated more on the red fruit peels, and grapes side of the fence. There is a bit of the bready malts in the mix, but they are very subdued from what I was expecting.
This isnt punching in the same weight class as Westvleteren 12 and Rochefort 10, but once you get your mind wrapped around that, its a pretty decent beer. Might fall into the one-time enjoyment category however, as I doubt Id reach for it again when beer shopping.","","Randy4Beer"

- Aspecto: Es una cerveza oscura color oscuro amarfilado, opaca, densa y potente. 
- Aroma: Complejo aroma de maltas tostadas , caramelo y hierbas sigue evolucionando durante su consumo, dependiendo de la temperatura de la copa. 
- Cuerpo/sabor: Cuerpo redondo y equilibrado, no fuerte de sabor, suavizado por el agua especial de características dulces, predominando el sabor a malta tostada, levadura, y caramelo, con notas de frutos rojos, y café.

2863,"2015-03-21",4.0,"Tried a small bottle out of a holiday mixer pack.

Smells very sweet. A little off putting to be honest. Fruity aroma.

Pours a very dark amber. Head dispersal quickly. Very hazy with bits of fermentation suspended in the beer.

Has plenty of carbonation. Goes down smooth for a beer with such a high alcohol content.

Overall I was very pleased with this beer. Little to no overpowering hop taste. It was a little sweet for my liking, but we will see how the cellered bottles do in a year or so. You can tell this is a quality brew.

Clear, dark reddish brown with significant suspended dark sediment. Even more sediment was left in the bottom of the bottle. It had a 1-finger pastel yellow head and very good lacing. 

Intense raisin aroma with other dark fruit, toffee, apple, pear, vanilla and yeast. 

Taste of dates, raisins, black figs, apples, cloves, spices, vanilla, toffee and dark malt. The sediment does not seem to have hurt the flavor or the mouthfeel. 

Medium body and high carbonization.

The taste is bold but subtle all at once. The earthy hops come along first closely followed by the yeasts and a very nice and balanced lightly bitter sharpness slowly invades the palate from the back of the tongue. The sweetness is again just right and gives a nice foundation to all of the other elements. The mouthfeel is olily, sharp and dense which from my stand point is right on target.

Dark brown beer, moderately cloudy, with a thick beige foam, forming high and lowered just to keep for a long time, a low to medium height.

With a high alcohol content, this beautiful beer remains smooth and balanced. Very complex and intense.

Aroma and flavor are levemento burned caramel, brown sugar and cocoa. A fruity touch, black fruits, complements the range of attributes. Its flavor explodes with ease. Your Aftertaste is super persistent and maintains the exact characteristics of flavor that will prolong the striking rustic for nice rustic.

The creaminess of the foam, mouthfeel, smoothness even 10% alcohol impresses this drink.

The aroma and taste, I would say that there are beers that are more complex than this, but the hard thing is to have this balance, respect a perfect drinkability which lets you take sips and gulps without even going near seasick.

Aromas are really what sets this beer apart as one of the 100 percentile: it has some wine-like qualities, some alcohol is present on the nose, black licorice, cherry, wet wood, plum, cocoa, raisin and some vanilla.

2863,"2014-10-21",3.6,"""one of the better early Belgians. The mouthfeel and flavor would maybe get a higher score, but the yeast takes the carbonation too high for me, and really gives it a flavor common to many Belgians...not a bad thing, but not completely unique either. Good, but a little overrated? 3/09 - had with the Rochefort line-up and while it wasnt as good in my mind as the 10, it did ok. the abv is more noticeable and takes away from the feel and flavor, compared to the 10-not as smooth and a little more harsh and spicy, but still good. same scores.""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

A: Arrived in the snifter as a deep, hazy cherrywood hue, with a lovely thick head that fell quickly into a white cap and left crazy lacing on the snifter.

S: Malt candy, for lack of a better term. Sweet bready caramel sugars, wreathed through with raisin and plum notes, and something that reminds me of an oaken single malt scotch barrel.

T: Oh, that is glorious. Malt candy, indeed - yeasty caramel sweetness right up front, uncut by any hoppy notes. Raisin, plum, cherry, and fig notes writhe through this delicious beer, with some faint woody-oaky echoes. The finish is pure Belgian yeast, with a boozy warmth and some echoes of fruit and sugar.

2863,"2014-10-18",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 24, 2015 Tasted from 33 cl and 75 cl bottles as well as from tap many a time, this is one of the leading abts of Belgium. Historically, this was the commercial version of Westvleteren 12, under the brand name of Sint-Sixtus, a cooperation which ended in 1992. Today, Sint-Bernardus Abt, Prior and Pater are still made with the same malts, the same hops and the same yeast as Westvleteren, though clearly the yeast has evolved a bit differently since then. Since Westvleteren has received so much media attention - a consequence of it achieving the highest rating on this very site - this beer is often presented as an easier to obtain alternative, and indeed the similarities are still striking, though I will not go as far as to claim that no differences are discernible. This beer bears a moussy and relatively (even surprisingly) stable, pale beige, sticky head and shows a warm, dark burgundy colour with equal haze. It presents a strong, wonderfully perfumed and therefore very agreeable aroma of great complexity, revealing hints of overripe pears, sweet cherries and plums, port wine, marzipan, banana, iron but in a good kind of way, brown sugar, liquorice, chocolate liqueur, fresh orange, brown bread, blue grapes, candied dates, cloves... Taste kicks off with a soft, candyish sweetishness of candied fruits, raisins, pear, candi sugar; fluffy and full mouthfeel, medium, minerally carbonation; in the background, I get a profound, chocolatey and caramelly, smooth maltiness, bready yeast and elegant spicy notes dancing on the tongue. Finishes graciously with a leafy hop bitterness which lingers and perfectly balances out the sweetness, maltiness is also still present as well as a certain yeastiness, everything rounded off with a warming, not too astringent, whisky-like alcohol effect. Though indeed very similar to Westvleteren 12, this is clearly a different beer, which anyone familiar with both should be able to distinguish in a blind tasting session. It has nearly the same amount of complexity and nobility, but the aromas do not match completely, the alcohol in this one is perhaps just a little bit less hidden, the mouthfeel is a little bit more syrupy and there is a little bit less aromatic spiciness to it. I will do a side by side tasting of both soon. In any case: Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 remains one of the great landmarks of Belgian beer culture and a proud classic in its own right, regardless of the historical links with the Sint-Sixtus abbey.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly slick/creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Quadrupel style.

As I had particularly enjoyed other products of this brewery, I had a go. And now everything has changed. If quadrupels are really like this, then I want more. This dark amber beer has those fruits in the cellar holding the main backbone of the aroma and taste. An explosion of apples, plums, peaches and apricots, old books and wooden crates, wicker baskets and dusty curtains, dark empty wine bottles and firewood.

2863,"2014-07-24",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 7-18-12 - 
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer was served a brownish-red color with only a tiny white head. The head faded very fast to give only a light amount of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma was a nice mix of fruit, bread and yeast. There were stronger notes of dark fruit, such as prunes and plum, as well as a good yeast cake aroma. These were all balanced by a semi-sweet brown bread and biscuit aroma. Overall it was quite nice.

 Taste  The taste starts out with a good shot of fruit and malt. A sweet dark cherry flavor mixed with a biscuit base great the tongue. As the taste moves on other dark fruit flavors enter the tongue and are mixed with notes of a yeasty flavor as well as some candied/sugary flavors. All the while a prune flavor accompanied by an alcohol flavor creep into the taste. At the end a somewhat alcohol flavored, dark fruit sweet and lightly bready flavor are left on the tongue. Delicious.

 Mouthfeel- the body of the beer was about right for its abv., being on the creamier and thicker side, with a carbonation level that was on the lower side. Both the body and the carbonation accentuated all the dark fruit and malty flavors as well as complemented the warming feel of the alcohol quite nicely.

 Overall - Rated high for a reason. It has a wonderful taste, aroma, and feel . Delicious.","","Darkmagus82"

Head is slightly tan with a few more of those bit. (Might have been a little less than gentle with this bottle before the pour.) Nose of caramel sweetness, nice toasted malts, smallest hint of nuts and some bready yeasts.

Mouth feel is great with medium carbonation that along with alcohol results in a strong tang around the tongue.

2863,"2014-03-18",5.0,"Abt 12 has earned a place of honor among its Belgian contemporaries. St. Bernardus has paid its dues to get into that select group. Make no mistake, its hard work to make beer that is this satisfying. The plain brown body supports a hearty head and contains a lot of dark sediment. While the aroma is light, it reveals an abundance of dark fruit and grains. The tasting experience is awesomely complex. Champagne-like fruit flavors hit the tongue, first. They quickly mature into sensations of plum and raisin. The long finish eventually dissolves into a brown sugar sweetness. Its the kind of brew that deserves to be sipped and shared.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

2863,"2014-02-13",4.4,"75cL bottle poured into a goblet. Strong raisin and doughy notes come off the beer as its being poured and dominate the nose for a couple seconds before a mild fizzy and astringent character peeks through, which, in turn, if followed by a combination of citrus and spice, some vanilla, cola-like caramel, and banana. Near the end, a minor woody note comes through with a light mildew / damp towel note. The beer is a deep, dark, lightly hazy mahogany with a big, jello-like, off-white head that has excellent retention, but a runny lacing that looks nice for a second before cascading back into the beer. The taste is highly sweet with a moderate bitter finish. Its full bodied with loads of carbonation giving it a relatively thin texture that goes down smooth and creamy. Dark cherries hit the tongue first followed by a floral gin-like alcohol warmth and bitterness. The floral gin notes stick around for the finish and a smokey bourbon quality with some spice come through.

Depends on the consumer. I enjoyed it very much compared to similar beers. Keep it as cold as possible!","","taylorqj"
2863,"2014-02-05",5.0,"APPEARANCE: Dark, almost black body that demonstrates a reddish hue when held up to light. Strong, thick head. Sediment floating around inside the bottle. 

AROMA: The aroma is fantastic on this beer. There's dark fruits, like plum, raisin, fig. Sweet, caramel malts. I also detected brown sugar and a little bit of cinnamon. There's also a whiff of alcohol in there - at 10% it was expected. 

TASTE: What a great, complex taste, with just about all elements of the nose showing strong. The malts offer a sweet caramel breadiness that's well complemented by the plum, raisin, and fig, as well as a little bit of banana. Brown sugar is also noticeable, with a trace amount of chocolate mixed in as well. 

MOUTHFEEL: No surprises. Thick and heavy, with alcoholic warming. Also somewhat creamy. Where I think this beer shines is that despite the sweetness, it's never syrupy or sickly. 

OVERALL: People who've had both tell me that Westvleteren XII is marginally better than Abt 12. I haven't had Westy, so for now, Abt 12 is my favorite quad. I feel like I should have more quads before giving this a 100, but I think it's the perfect example of the style.

Rich and complex with good balance between a whole host of dark fruits, sugar, sweet malts and spices plus some grapes, figs, yeast and even some banana. Some light alcohol rounds things off.

Murky to caramel brown with a thumb sized, bubbly head that holds well. Lots of visible carbonation too.

Very sweet and filled with sugar upfront, the beer is loaded with sweet fruits that includes some banana and figs along with a touch of apple and grape. There is some Belgian yeast in there too and a touch more alcohol than the nose had suggested but it is still lighter than you would expect going in. The beer is rounded off with some further fruit flavours and an intensely sweet taste.

Smooth and crisp on the tongue with medium body and a well carbonated feel to it. There is a huge amount of sweetness from start to finish with only faint hints of alcohol in places. Great balance & it goes down well.

Off, off white, almost tan head of foam that looks like it will last but doesnt. Leaves sheets of soapy lace to look at as they fall back into the glass.

Nose has a bit of alcohol on it. I bring it up first because its a bit sharp . medicinal. Nose is clove, ripe fruit. Plum and fig. fresh and alive. Waves of sweetness from malt and a light brown sugar. Cake like malt. Buttery, juicy earthy too. The yeast is powdery and dry and promises some lightness. Nothing burnt, nothing roasted just as it should be. Its comforting.

Taste is complex and rich. It unfolds and becomes so many things. It starts with fresh plum and fig, then becomes dried prune and raisin. then there is a touch of tart cherry. The yeast stays soft and dry and keeps things light and uplifted. The carbonation is effervescent and while thats true this beer is creamy. CREAMY. The fruits are sweet and resilent and the alcohol has a touch of dryness, a touch of spice and a bit of pepper and bitter to impart to the finish. 

The finish is sweet and warming and by the time you finish this glass the alcohol is sweet not sharp. It has won you over with flavors that surrounded it. The fruit danced on the palate, the malt richness was cake like and light. The spice intriguing. I will have another even though I said I wouldnt at first.","New York, USA","pinkie"

Taste: An intense warm full sensation invades the mouth to start with, followed by a fruit salad; cherry, raisins, figs, as well as caramel, spices (cinnamon, clove).

2863,"2013-10-05",4.4,"Had on-tap at One-Eyed Bettys in Ferndale, Michigan as part of a paddle.

Appearance: Basically perfect. The 10% ABV seems impossible given the nice little head this beer showed off, and the wall of lace that this left through my whole sample glass. Wow. Abt 12 has a deep brown/red color, and doesnt seem to have much (any?) haze. Marvelous to look at.

Smell: Ive never had a quadrupel... thats my disclaimer here. I didnt know what to expect going in, other than that this is one of the very best beers in the world, according to a lot of people. I got a lot of doughy bread and dark fruits. The cracker aromas sort of came through in the initial whiff, and the fruits were in the ""after smell"". Very good smelling stuff.

Taste: 10%? Really? Initially I didnt think I really loved this beer all that much, but then I noticed that I was sipping it more often than the other beers I had in my sampler. Theres just a lot going on with this beer. The cracker/dough flavors are there in a pretty big way, then the non-descript ""dark fruits"" come in a little bit, and then theres just an alcohol warmth and its all gone. All the while, Abt 12 is never bitter and never really sweet (and therefore cloying) at all.

I got this beer for a few reasons. First, Ive heard insanely good things about it. Second, I had never tasted a quad (to my knowledge) before. Third, and most college-boy esque of me, it had a pretty high ABV and I didnt think it would hurt to get a little buzz going on. Turns out, this mayve been my favorite beer from the night. I dont tend to drink imported beer (local jobs, yadayadayada), but this is impressive. Its not cheap, by any means, but this is something worth treating yourself to, time-to-time. This really makes me want to try beers like Rochefort and Westvleteren now... my interest has officially been piqued.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

Great with soups. meat or rich vegie dishes, deserts. Ive had this in Belgium, in various states, on tap, in small, big, and very big bottles. This is a great beer to serve fresh or after years of aging. I should add that I did in 2007 represent St Bernardus in California which means I drank a lot of their whole line-up.

St bernardus is a little more subtle in its nose, not as aromatic, yet still slightly sweet... Both colors are nearly identical, deep brown caramel... Alcohol content is more apparent in the Westvletern, not outrageously sweet as I expected, but pleasant, not overpowering...

2863,"2013-08-18",4.5,"Revisiting an old favourite! AU$9, worth every cent. 

Pours a two finger head, relatively clean white and hangs around for a while. That dark, murky quad look - unappealing to the uninitiated, but perfect for the quad drinkers!

Smell of dark fruit - fig, plum, cherry - as well as brown sugar, bread. 

We've got the beautiful quad brown sugar, bread, a touch of spice. Less fruit than was on the nose. Very well balanced however. Alcohol is there, but not as boozy as Rochefort and lacks the heavy fruit notes of Rochefort and Westvleteren.

Where this beer beats the other quads is on its unparalleled, warm mouthfeel, very full and it sits on your tongue for an eternity, slowly making its way backwards bringing smooth flavour until you get a small hop sharpness at the back. Beautifully warming, as good as mouthfeel gets! 

I love Abt 12, Ro 10 and Westy 12 all in their own ways. This is the 'weakest' if you can say that, but it truly grows on me every single time I try it. It really isn't the same as the West 12 - despite the fact they seem similar on paper due to their history - but to simply look at it in those terms ignores what it truly is. I would thoroughly recommend the Christmas ale and Wit to any St Bernardus fans too.

2863,"2013-07-31",4.2,"De Sint Bernardus Abt 12 is ook één van de bieren die al langer tot mijn absolute favorieten behoort. Er nu pas een beoordeling over schrijven is zoiets als het warm water terug moeten uitvinden. Het verhaal doet de ronde dat dit bier gebaseerd is op de Westvleteren 12. In de periode dat de brouwzaal van Westvleteren aan vernieuwing toe was, werd de productie enige tijd overgenomen door de naburige brouwerij van Sint Bernardus. Tijdens deze periode zou de toenmalige brouwmeester dit bier hebben ontwikkeld met de Westvleteren 12 in het achterhoofd. Aangezien ik ooit nog maar eenmaal het genoegen had en Westvleteren 12 te drinken, en ook er mij weinig van kan herinneren aangezien dit in een pre-ratebeer.com tijdperk was, kan ik dus geen objectieve vergelijking maken. Door neemt niet weg dat Sint Bernardus abt 12 een graag geziene gast in mijn koelkast is. Het aroma van de 12 is zacht zoet met en vleugje gebrande Candij. Het bier is donker met een licht amberkleurige toets. De schuimkraag is vol, mokka-kleurig en gewelfd, vermoedelijk door de hogere gisting. De smaak ligt in het verlengde van het aroma, doch laat zich meer geworden. Een bier met een zachte candijsmaak, een vleugje karamel en een lichte fruitige toets die het midden houdt tussen pruimen en donkere, rode vruchten. Wat ik zeker kan appreciëren in dit bier is dat zowel in het aroma, maar ook in de smaak de uitgesproken banaansmaak achterwege blijft, dit terwijl de 12 toch een bier van hoge gisting is.
Het mondgevoel is wat mij betreft perfect in balans, met een goed evenwicht tussen enerzijds sprankelend verfrissend, doch voldoende stevig om lang van elke slok te kunnen genieten. Wat mij betreft is de Sint Bernardus abt 12 dus een echte aanrader, ééntje dat ik maar al te graag in huis heb, zowel ?s winters als in de zomer, maar waarvan ik even goed weet dat hij niet elke bierliefhebber, zoals sommigen in mijn omgeving, kan behoren.

330ml bottle from Sherbrooke. Dark chestnut coloured pour with a creamy, bubbly tan head that fades quickly. Aroma is predominantly yeast, hint of roast malt and dried pear. Flavour is dried fruit, sourness from the yeast and a lingering bitterness. Not doing it for me compared to other abts I have sampled, getting more yeast and spiciness than richness of chocolate and fruit notes.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","bulldogops"

2863,"2013-07-06",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2014 Bière brune rouge, totalement remplie de particules pouvant être assez grosses et au travers desquelles leffervescence est difficile à observer, mais celle-ci semble tout de même bonne, et surmontée dun col beige un peu mince mais bien résistant. Arômes de pain grillé, caramel, chocolat et petits fruits foncés (raisin, cerise, prune/pruneau), avec des traces de levure belge, de banane bien mûre et dépices (anis et clou de girofle surtout). Le nez est bien agréable, affichant une belle complexité, mais il pourrait être plus intense cependant. En bouche, cest peu pétillant sur langue, plutôt mousseux, et affichant une belle onctuosité au palais, cest rond et soyeux. Au goût, on retrouve pas mal les arômes précédemment humés, pain grillé, caramel, beaucoup de petits fruits foncés, un peu de levure belge et danis. Mais ce nest pas tellement sucrée comme bière (surtout pour le style), le malt étant bien équilibré par, dabord un houblon floral tout de même assez présent menant à une amertume plutôt légère mais bien sentie, mais surtout par un goût alcoolisé passablement présent. Je trouve dailleurs que ce goût alcoolisé semble par moment à la limite de lagréable, surtout en fin de bouche qui semble par moment très alcoolisé. Cette bière est (heureusement!) bien plus intense en bouche quau nez, où elle affiche toujours cette belle complexité. Équilibre intéressant, intégration des différentes saveurs entre elles qui pourrait être mieux (je pense surtout à lalcool ici).

2863,"2013-05-10",3.8,"330 ml bottle, at home, poured into a trappist glass. ABV 10% on my bottle.
Very deep mahogany brown colour on the body, with one finger tall head, but that comes mainly because of my glass width. Beige in colour, with average to good retention, and light lacing left on the glass.
Aroma of dark fruits, plums, and malts. A bit of the alcohol too. Aroma becomes stronger as the beer warms up. 
Very nice taste, with lots of dark fruits, red grapes, malts, with the alcohol very well hidden.A metallic flavour at first but again, seems to disappear as the beer warms up.

2863,"2013-05-07",4.0,"Poured from a bottle.  Redish brown with a big foamy head that eventually disapates to a thin cap, a twirl of the glass is all it takes to regenerate it.  The lacing is outstanding.  The aroma brings caramel, sweet bready malt, and hint of tart cherries... and a healthy dose of booze.  The taste is sweet, but not overly so.  The malts provide caramel and toffee and as the beer opens up a bit, the dark fruits really start to shine through.  Theres a bit of spice (clove) in the finish and the whole thing warms you up a bit.  The mouthfeel is outstanding - the carbonation gives the beer a crispness while maintaining smooth drinkability.

2863,"2013-05-01",4.5,"330ml bottle into a snifter.

Pours a clear very dark ruby with really no head at all. Just some lace that swirls on the surface and also leaves a bit of wispy lacing.

The aroma is very vinous with an almost port-like quality. Lots of dark fruit such as raisins, prunes, dates, and figs. A little bit of toffee and roast is in there too with even a very quick whiff of coffee. Quite deep and complex.

The flavor outdoes the aroma in terms of depth with a huge hit of dark fruit and red wine along with plum and fig. Some underlying notes of overripe fruit and toffee with a touch of roast coming in at the very end when all of the fruit dissipates. There is just a light hint of bitterness and a breath of alcohol at the end with a silky mouthfeel and a lightly sticky finish.

Overall, what a wonderful and complex brew. There is just so much depth of aroma and flavor here it is indescribable. Truly a world-class beer that all beer lovers should experience.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

Big sweet flavor with an explosion of ripening fruits, caramel, rich bready malts, some alcohol kick, prune, fig, banana. Full bodied with lively, massaging carbonation.

S - Soft Belgian yeast. Clove, brown sugary malt, dark fruits.

T - Dark cherries, plums, bananas, caramelized toffee and brown sugar. The malt is complex and comforting. The spices are soft and subtle. Has some ginger in the middle. Belgian yeast resides throughout.

M - Medium to full bodied. Low carbonation.

Pick this guy up, immediately head home, dust off your favorite snifter and go to town. This guy is delicious. Its brewed with artisan water that is pumped from a depth of 500 feet, which is especially impressive when compared to the likes of bud light or Miller lite, whose water source is, on the best day, a puddle and on the worst day toilet water. Toilet water from the upper tank, no doubt, but toilet water nonetheless. The aroma is pleasing and not overwhelming, and although this packs a mean alcohol punch, youd be hard pressed to taste it.

Carbonated slightly above average, perhaps due to the 500 foot deep artesianal well water, which is just plain awesome, although I have no scientific facts about that.

Appearance: Deep molasses brown with a touch of ruby.  Huge soapy off-white head for a 10% ABV beer.

Aroma: Overripe banana, a touch of clove and coriander (hurray, Belgians!).  Molasses and caramel provide a heavy, sweet richness.

Taste: Molasses, brown sugar sweetness, dark fruits (dates and figs), overripe banana, banana bread.  A hint of sour cherry in the finish.  A touch of booziness.

Mouthfeel: A lot more carbonation than I expected at the beginning.  The carbonation tingles the mouth.

Overall: This is a great big Belgian that works extremely well for me.  The combination of the big malt sweetness and the dark and sour fruits mix with the high carbonation in order to provide a drinkable beer that is sweet without being cloying.  Extremely pleasant.

2863,"2013-02-27",4.3,"Originally reviewed: 11/27/12. Spent the holiday weekend down in Greenville, SC with some friends and had to go the Trappe Door for my Belgian fix. I really wanted a Quad, but alas, there were none on draft. This is one Ive wanted to try for quite some time, but keep passing up. Not this time. This was the small 11.2oz bottle, poured into a St. Bernardus chalice.

Pours a dark ruby-mahogany garnet with a small sheet of lace on top. Rich aroma of plum, grape, stawberry, alcohol, all washed in a pleasant floral scent. Carbonated well. Good heft to this makes this a great sipper. Holds up the richness of this beer quite well. 

The flavors mirror the aroma making this one a nice decadent treat. Fig, raisin, plum, molasses, syrup, and just a touch of booze on the finish. Theres a lot going on here, and Im not sure this bottle was big enough for me to capture all of the nuances. I guess thats what the 750s are for.

Taste is fantastic - grape followed by caramel and toffee arising from the malt and belgian sugars. As it warms it becomes even more thick and warming. The alcohol is scarily hidden here.

Im not sure how close this is to the W12, but this is not my favorite beer.

appearance: Copper brown with creme firm head. Nice lacing. 

smell: Hard to pin point what im getting. Its sort of a acidic medicinal smell together with brown sugar. 

taste: There is some medicinal flavors going on, green apple and spices with alcohol in the nose. Some clove and very faintly some cinnamon. Followed by a more bodied brown sugar kick. Its at this point the beer feels more defined and whole. But the finish is then again quite spicy and alcohol tasting. The flavors seem to be gone quite quick. 

mouthfeel: Loads of carbonation. Actually quite a kick. Lacks a bit of creaminess to it. Its slighly milky maybe, but leaves a bit of a slimy effect on the pallet. 

overall: Not the best beer ive had. Maybe its because i had high expectations. But ive had 4 the last few months and ive had mixed experiences.","NETHERLANDS","Xstream"

2863,"2013-02-04",5.0,"Et voici la 8ème merveille du monde, la basilique que lon navait pas retrouvée depuis
les temps antiques ... Je mexplique un peu : je peux dire pour plusieurs raisons
que cette bière peut être considérée comme la 8 ème trappiste (donc la 7ème de Belgique)
si jai la gentillesse dinclure la Trappe dans les trappistes authentiques...
On doit témoigner un respect maximal pour un brasseur qui a brassé (cest comme le chasseur
qui a chassé) la trappiste de Westvleteren... En effet, les bons moines ont confié leur recette
à un civil pour faire le travail de brassage....
Je suppose quen reconnaissance éternelle, le brasseur a voulu depuis porter fièrement le nom
dun saint, et quoi de mieux que St Bernard  Je brode, mais cette légende que jinvente
ressemble étrangement à la vérité...
Ce breuvage me rend strictement mystique à chaque fois que je le verse dans un verre.
Déjà il faut être très prudent et bien armé pour louvrir, parce que sa force vive à louverture
est proverbiale. Lécume ressemble sous la capsule à un océan déchaîné qui est impatient 
de vous révéler toute sa puissance dabord alcoolique (12 sur la capsule mais en fait 10,5 % abv,
sauf si on la laisse vieillir, auquel cas cette bière peut atteindre son niveau affiché), mais
aussi gustative... Au simple décapsulage, on est en présence des arômes qui se développent
dans la pièce, comme une fleur de printemps qui se répand dans votre intérieur.
Strictement fabuleux.
La couleur est un brun marron châtaigne tout à fait typique des trappistes brunes.
Déjà à ce niveau on est fixé... Que dire du reste ??
Clarté assez opaque, quoique en transparence on peut se rendre compte du pétillant fin
et bien réparti.
La mousse beige est bien crémeuse et vient tapisser ce breuvage divin, comme il sied à
un ornement religieux.
Les arômes, aaaah les arômes, comment vous expliquer .
Un jardin dOrient en pleine explosion, un volcan darômes, dabord sur la pomme cuite,
puis le pruneau (dAgen bien sûr), le banyuls millésimé, le porto vintage du bien nommé
Douro, des nuances de levure en suspension et une pointe de banane (pas la commerciale,
mais la petite africaine savourée sur place).
La texture est douce et suave, veloutée comme un tapis de mohair.
La 1ère bouche, que je mets en principe quasi 5 minutes à savourer, est un complexe
incalculable de nuances, avec des fruits mûrs, du pruneau, des céréales maltées, de la 
levure en quantité, avec de façon très amusante une pointe de bigarreau en arrière-bouche...
Mais que cette bouche est pleine et merveilleuse....
La 2ème que lon aura donc attendu longtemps... est sur lirish whiskey avec une pointe
de girofle qui aurait trempé dans lalcool quelques mois. 
La 3ème est de retour sur le vieux banyuls, la vigne du Médoc, le gâteau de Savoie, la
brioche, avec une très fine pointe de sureau tendre. Tout un art. Un plat 3 étoiles de 
restaurant de classe mondiale. Une fontaine dimpressions qui vous inondent et vous 
laissent quasi inconscient...
La levure est un véritable miracle, avec de larmagnac, du bois de chêne, de la prune mûre
et une pointe de vanille.
La longueur est divine, éternelle.
La finale est angélique.
Cette bière, et cest une des rares, a limmense pouvoir de me shooter à chaque fois...
cest un mystère divin qui se développe et se révèle devant vous comme la transsubstantiation,
et je peux vous dire que cest aussi long que ce mot... et même tout le sermon de la messe
du dimanche....
Cette bière est divine, et comme le divin est incommensurable, il ny a virtuellement pas de
cote pour cette bière. Si vous en voulez une absolument (très beau jeu de mots), alors disons
777 sur 100. Cest ma cote pour la Westvleteren 12, je ne peux pas plus, et quel honneur pour
cette bière...  Je voulais vous loffrir pour ma 50ème cote de 5 en bières belges. Merci mon dieu.","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

2863,"2012-12-31",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 25, 2013 Re-rated on 25/12/2013 as Christmas 2013 Belgian Quads Parallel Tasting"" - Part 2 of 3

330 ml bottle bought at Belgian Beer International in Tsuen Wan.
Preparation: bottle maintained at ambient temperature of 10°C - 12°C overnight; Popped at 10.6°C (within recommended temperature range) onto the Chimay chalice.

Looks: Translucent blackish brown colour with dirt-like yeast sediments; Two and half finger head and beautiful, lasting light beige foam; Excellent sticky lacing with active carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant vanilla and bubble gum as soon as it was popped, with nicely-woven raisin, banana, caramel, sugar, cream, strong Bel yeast, malt, cinnamon, cloves and herbs. What a beauty! 

Taste: A great combination of flavours, started out with intense plum, raisin and dark fruits, closely followed by warming alcohol, sugar, malt, light banana, cream, bourbon, strong herbs, spices and fairly light grass.

Body: Mid to light, slightly slick and creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: a fantastic combination of taste varieties  intense dark fruits, good impression of banana, caramel and cream one dont normally find in a Quad, beautiful sweetness with light touch of bubblegum. Full maltyness, strong Bel yeast, and very nice herbal to top it off. Excellent!

Booze and Sweetness: The 10% abv is surely strong but unlike Rochefort 10, it doesnt scream out loud nor it bites my head off with subsequent sips. It hides itself quite well, and has light bourbon to show up now and then to mangle with the tastes. Sugar sweetness is very appropriate, never cloying, just intertwine perfectly with the booze to up the flavours. Marvelous!

Hoppiness: Complex! Fragrant cinnamon, herbal, light cloves and faint grassy nose and taste. Some faint bitterness in the background but at this level, who cares? The comfy sweet booze finish is good enough to round things up.

After Taste: Wet, lightly sweet boozy and smooth to mouth.

Comments: Thought I was too green to rate and appreciate Quads in early 2013, so the opportunity comes in Christmas Day to re-rate this one along with Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren XII, to find out which ones the best and to close the year in style! :)

With this re-rate, I have another perspective of Sint Bernardus 12 and I appreciate it more than ever. Rochefort 10 may have some kiss-ass whiskey and brandy taste, but its also alcoholic as hell and taste varieties is rather limited. On the other hand, Saint Bernardus 12 may have been following the tried and tested path of Strong Belgian Dark, but it truly excels on all front - beautiful colour, lasting head, pleasingly complex aroma and taste, very well-managed alcohol and sweetness - not to mention smooth and comfy to boot. Every aspect of the beer is so balanced and work so well collectively, it really deserves a pat in the back. It was amazing then and it still amaze me now. In absence or scarcity of the precious Westvelteren XII, I wholeheartedly recommend this one over Rochefort 10 on any given day. A true beauty!

Cloudy dark ale brown colour; Very good, thick and lasting beige head and frothy; Very good and longlasting lacing and oily; Fine and fragment smell of malt, yeast, plum and fig with a hint of alcohol; Medium body, hops taste minimal; Not quite as smooth to mouth as Chimay Blue but has a pleasant feel, alcoholic taste is subtle and not as pronounce nor potent as Rochefort Trappistes 8; Bitterness is minimal, comfy and subtle; lively, enjoyable throughtout with sweet aftertaste. At abv 10.5%, the rush didnt come as fast as I expected, after 10-15 minutes and its very gradual and I had no bad trip at all, lovely feeling as expected for a good abt. :)

Comments: As one of the top dog, St. Bernardus Abt 12 didnt disappoint. At abv 10.5%, I was worry it may be as boozy and explicit as Rochefort Trappistes 8, but its character hold up elegantly just like Chimay Blue. Its lack of palatable smoothness and creaminess may be the only minus but that doesnt prevent the Abt 12 from being one of the worlds top beers among beer lovers. Excellent with trappist cheese. Highly Recommended!

Aroma of strong dark fruitiness and sweet maltiness; the usual notes of plum, raisin and licorice appear, as do some spiciness and pear - more fruity than spicy.

2863,"2012-12-28",4.4,"Tasting in Chimay Goblet, served at 52-60

Aroma is raisony, fig dark fruit in character and smells sweet

Color is dark red with sparkling bubble coming up

Taste, is sweet at first with some lingering bitterness evident of a low residual sweetness and sweetness is probably due do the alcohol level.  Slight afterburn from alcohol, very tasty!  Reminds me of quite a few Dubbels out there but more kick

Palate, very easy drinking and scary at 10.5%, as stated before, pretty dry and easy to drink.

I certainly liked this, a lot less of the plum character I get from westy 12.  I think this has more fruitiness and character that west 12 does.

2863,"2012-12-27",4.5,"Reviewed 12/04/2012. About time I review this. 11.2 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a very dark reddish brown color. The head is a four finger light tan color. Rather than recede in a generic manner, the head merely loses texture before only collapsing partially. There is a LOT of lacing on the glass - not the ringed lacing of a good IPA, but spotty with large clumps.

S: Lots of caramel malts, stewed dark fruits (like fig, plum, and raisin), lighter fruit esters (pear, apple), and a hint of chocolate. Perhaps not as enchantingly nuanced as Rochefort 10, but still wondrously aromatic. Nicely bready.

T: The very first sip is loaded with chocolate, caramel, and dark fruit. After a few more sips, a balanced sensation of pears and phenols pop up on the finish along side faint alcohol warmth. I can also pick up a touch of raspberry and leafy tobacco as well, and the aftertaste has a bit of a milky cream flavor that is immensely enjoyable. It takes a while, but eventually, a spiced sensation of subtle nutmeg and cinnamon on the palate will show itself a little more than half way down the glass. Quite complex, but a little less so than Rochefort 10 - which is a moot point at the end of the day. This still has top caliber balance and craftsmanship.

M: Not perfectly delicate, but the bodys thickness is perfect. Theres just enough of a cleanliness to the finish to encourage one to drink this faster. The booze manifests as a slight warmth on the tongue and stomach - but because of its balance, it just works in concert with the whole experience.

O: It might be one of the more drinkable and balanced quads Ive ever had. Course, Ive never had Westy 12, but Hell, doesnt Westy 12 have a very, VERY similar recipe to this? Ah well, that doesnt matter, because its every bit as mindblowing as I hoped.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Wow. Figs, raisins, cherries hit on the very tip of the nose but quickly becomes a strong rum soaked scent. Theres a sweet bread character lurking in the background. Very sweet overall and almost wine like. Phenols are blossoming left and right. Extremely complex and heavy on the nose.

The sweet raisin and fig notes carry well on the front of the tongue and they dominate the top of the palate. The a strong sweet bread character on the center of the tongue that starts to blossom in warming alcohol at the end. The sugar shines on the center but doesnt carry to powerfully to not let the bread character shine. Im impressed by the alcohol lightness.

Very, very carbonated and I think that helps the flavors move better than the would otherwise. Things could be quite strong without the powerful carbonation and it makes sense here.

2863,"2012-10-28",5.0,"Birra di unaromaticità intensa dovuta essenzialmente al lievito utilizzato e allalta gradazione alcolica, fa prevedere allolfatto quello che poi si riscontrerà nel gusto, ovvero una dolcezza calda, avvolgente, ma senza risultare stucchevole, come spesso accade nelle produzioni belghe. Cioccolato, prugne mature, amarena, addirittura cuoio! Il colore è tonaca di frate, come è ovvio che sia trattandosi di una quadrupel (sebbene questa definizione di stile non abbia molto senso) e si nota una certa densità. La schiuma è cremosa e vellutata e, se ben servita, mantiene un velo sottile, ma persistente. Birra tendenzialmente dolce di frutta rossa matura, ma con un aspetto di cioccolato fondente che, come detto in precedenza, fà sì che non risulti stucchevole. Non ci sono asperità in questa birra. E fin troppo facile amare il suo equilibrio e la sua consistenza lievemente cremosa, la carezza della carbonazione e quel finale ancora dolce, con note di caffè, di liquirizia, che non ti lascia mai...

Aroma is interesting and I can detect some pear, yeast and I think caramel.  The taste seems very well balanced with nothing sticking out.  It is very hard for me to describe as I am having difficulty discerning some of the flavors.  I have taken at least 20 sips and I still cannot detect many of the things noted by others.  To me it tastes a little sweet initially (I guess close to a very mild cherry flavor) with some malt but quickly changes to what I would describe as a tartness.

Scent is of dark fruit like plums and dates, belgian yeast, and malts. Taste is fantastic, notes of dark fruits, belgian yeast, and a bit of soy. There is a good amount of booziness though but not too much to detract from the well balanced flavor. This is a very very thick, full beer. Mouthfeel is thick, with that booziness and just a bit of very fine carbonation. Overall a fantastic brew, though due to how big of a beer this is, Its definitely one to take slow and enjoy. For those that want something a little crisper and less heavy, their Tripel fits perfectly - and I must say I enjoyed the two about the same overall.

Testattu yhdessä Rochefort 10:n kanssa vertailumielessä. Väriltään oluet ovat hyvin lähellä toisiaan. Abt 12 on ulkonäöltään täysi kymppi.

Tuoksussa Abt 12 on pehmeä, karamellinen ja yllättävän ""mieto"". R10 vahvasti anismainen. Maultaan Abt 12 on pehmeä, karamellisen maltainen ja hyvin miedosti, ei juuri lainkaan katkera. R10 on monimuotoisempi maultaan. Yhteenvetona: Abt 12 on ""helpompi"", pehmeämpi ja kauniimpi olut. R10 sisältää Rocheforteille tyypillisen anismaisen tuoksun. Lisäksi maku on syvempi ja voimakkaampi. Todellisia laatuoluita molemmat, mutta omassa arvoasteikossa Abt 12 on rinnan mitan edellä.","FINLAND","mice"
2863,"2012-05-24",3.5,"(2010 12oz bottle from LCBO) Poured near cellar temp, a very dark brown with a voluminous, pillowy tan head that persists. Aroma is predominantly dark brown sugar (muscovado?) from the malts, with just a faint hint of yeast and none of the expected dark fruit or spice complexity. Flavour followed the aroma almost exactly, and was sweet with a hint of bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel was very full, and the carbonation soft and creamy, with no detectable alcohol at all. Very well-balanced but the expected complexity was completely lacking, very straight-forward and unidimensional. Given the rave reviews I am attributing this to degradation during cellaring though the beer is not particularly old. Will review again after another sample.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

There are tight, small bubbles at the bottom of the head and larger bubbles in the middle and a wonderful rocky top surface. This head dissipates rather slowly and leaves gorgeous lacing on the glass.

S: Just how I expect a Quad to smell. Bready and biscuit like with yeast characteristics. There is wonderful sweet caramel and toffee aromas. I also pick out dark fruit like plum and raisin. I am having a hard time trying to get any alcohol on the nose and thats a surprise at 10% ABV. This smells outstanding and very inviting...cant wait to taste it. The smell just invites a sip.

T: Holy hell this is huge in flavor and complexity. I Get an initial sweetness and yeasty bready flavor followed by some caramel malt. Mid sip I pick up on the dark fruits of figs, raisins and plums. On the back end I sense a slight bitterness that is appealing and helps even out the sweetness. Fantastic tasting Quad!

M: Very, very smooth! This was the first thing that jumped out at me. I cant say just how smooth this is, unbelievably smooth! Little carbonation to speak of with medium mouthfeel. I do feel this coat my throat temporarily but it doesnt stick around too long. Great mouthfeel!

Mixed complex malts deliver a powerful, silky smooth fruitloaf base laden with molasses, soft toffee, figs, raisins, damsons and then hints of mocha coffee and rich chocolate truffle appear.

Very complex and strong beer. Not an easy-drinking beer. It has the classic Belgian characteristics. The yeast and the grain dominates, but its hard to find hops.","Budapest, HUNGARY","Thomasalias"

The taste is unique - its a different kind of carbonation.

2863,"2012-02-22",4.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 5/26/2009.  Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip.

A dark, thick brown color, with no translucence. A thick, creamy head forms from the outset. A very elegant, soft tan head remains, leaving a smattering of lace around the glass. 

Various dark fruits and a little bit of alcohol are noticeable in the strong aroma.

Figs, raisins, and plums are all equally weighted strong flavors. Hints of toffee, red grapes, and various spices also work their way in. After the initial flavor push, the sweetness really kicks in and carries through the slightly alcohol flavored ending. Leaves a sweet residue. Nothing held back here.

Above average carbonation, and there is a creamy and syrupy feel. Even though this is an intense beer, it still retains some lighter qualities. 

There is definitely a very nice flavor, but a little strong, maybe even a little bit sweet to get through that many. I might have to rotate something in to complement it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Tasted side by side with a Westvleteren 12:

I must say, this is what I hoped Westy 12 would taste like...

A - Pours just like the Westvleteren - murky dark ruby swamp water with a stubborn island of foam that sticks around the middle of the head, twins separated at birth.

S - Smells fantastic. Dark fruit, toasted grains, some kind of sweet syrup. Smells fresher than the Westy even though it predates it by a bit.

T - All the points of the smell carry through in the taste. Wonderful. Great quad without that lingering tobacco that I found in the Westy.

M - Perfect. Not syrupy or oily - medium body, medium to low carbonation, really fitting for the flavors it carries.

O - This really surpasses Westvleteren 12 in my book, and seemingly much more consistent (and cheaper). If you ever find yourself tempted to fork out wads for a Westy off the auction site, remember these words: ""Dont do it you pooter. Buy an Abt 12.""","Orono, Minnesota, USA","FURLYSURIOUS"

The aroma is very mild for a beer of this alcohol content but quite fruity. I would say a banana smell as much as Ive had in a beer. After quite a few sniffs looking for something else I smell a very light hint of citrus in it as well.

Appearance is a nice red as you would expect from most ales. It heads on pour fairly frothy which lasts about 5 min or so. 

Taste is sweet but not overly at all. Its sweetness is almost muted by the textures and aromas that accompany. Not much alcohol flavor for such a strong beer. The flavor improves with each sip and hangs afterward for a bit but certainly not too long.

Palate on first pull I found quite average for an ale except its very smooth. Very full bodied and quite creamy as well, almost milky in texture if it werent for the soft carbonation. The finish matches the taste and hangs around smoothly and softly for a bit but not too long.

Érdemes hosszan szájban tartani, mert folyton sugározza az új ízeket, lehet vele játszani, mint a robbanós cukorkával, ahogy kiadja magából a szénsavas, fügés, konyakos ízeket, előkerül a pipadohány, a vanília, majd végül az utóíze nehéz zsibbasztó száraz alkohol, akár egy konyak után.
Persze a komló is ott van valahol, de alig lehet rámutatni, annyira belesimul a komplex, barokkos harmóniába. Személyes véleményem szerint ebben a sörben jobban fel lehet ismerni a trappisták sörfőző művészetét, mint akár a Rochefort 10-esben, akár egy sor másik ennél, erősebb, barnább,. egyértelműbb kolostori sörben.","HUNGARY","tonycaviar"

Ap- The body of the beer is a bright orange coloration. Noted yeast debris rising to the surface of the beer on an active wave of carbonation. The head is a cinanmon tinged biege coloration. Crazy amounts of lacing mark my glass in a way I have only seen with Belgium quads.

T- The flavor of the beer is complexly wonderful. The flavor of the beer is toasted dark bread with a light caramel spread. The beer has dark fruit flavors but more of a melange than distinct flavors. The spicy yeast creates a clove and peppery finish to the beer. 

P- The beer has a commanding palate. I love a full bodied beer and this one delivers. This is a full bodied beer with active moderate carbonation. The alcohol doesnt play a factor in the beers palate.

2863,"2011-10-18",4.4,"By now, I have tried several St. Bernardus Abt 12 which in my opinion is the best beer I have tried: complex, sweet, fruity, toasty, aromatic, just wonderful!

I have poured into a Chimay chalice, and a Duvel tulip, both are ideal for this beer. I see how a perfect brown sugar cotton candy colored foam develops on top, crowning a dark molasses colored liquid. The aromas, are licorice, raisin, sugary, the taste is really good, no control, just amazing notes of toast, same aroma as taste. They went for everything, no taste overpowers any other, they all shine, like a rainbow? Yeah! like a rainbow, together all the tastes are wonderful, you take one out and it is just a normal beer.

In my mind, the St. Bernardus is better than the Westvleteren 12, it tasted courageous, like tradition, like a great beer: what Aragorn toasts and drinks with when in the company of great men!","USA","Lacho"

2863,"2011-10-15",4.1,"Served on-tap at Shady McGradys into a snifter.
A - Pours deep brown with a thick cap of one finger tall white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving thin webs of lacing down the glass.
S - Very strong smell overall. Hints of sweet malt, dry yeast, strong booze, dark fruits, and a touch of caramel sweetness. The booze is ever present and seems to only get stronger as the beer begins to warm.
T - Now we are talking. Still plenty of warming alcohol but it is tempered with hints of sweet malts, dark fruits, dry Belgian yeast, and some light spice. Finish is a mix of sweetness and warming booze. Very nice beer overall, just a touch too boozy for my liking.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Sweet, boozy, feel with most of it lingering throughout the finish.
D - Pretty good. I like quads, and this one is no different, but they really wear on me over the course of the glass. The combo of high price, $8 for this snifter...ouch!, and the strong booze really bring the drinkability down.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
2863,"2011-10-13",3.9,"33cl bottle. Dark brown with a mighty head. It goes of so Ill pour some more ...Smells like cherry favored whysky with some banana. Sip : sweet with a smooth body, finely carbonated. Alcohol is there every sip and it could bother me with a second glass couse its that kind of alcohol aroma that goes deep down. Its still a good beer, the malts tasts familiar to many beers I drunk here in Belgium like for exemple Tripple Karmelit. But this beer is more familiar to Rochefort 10 still I prefer the Trappist one. Not a bad beer, far from it : its a great beer but like I said : I see often Rochefort 10 and St.Bernardus 12 side to side on the shop shelves and not twice Im gonna think wchich one to choose.","Warszawa, POLAND","Swaroga"

2863,"2011-10-10",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 8, 2012 Bottle @ Head of Steam, Durham. 081011. Rating 9/4/9/5/19
App - Very dark brown, hazy, big tan head. Served in St. Bernardus glass.
Aroma - Dark complex malts, bready yeast, dark fruits, not much alcohol aroma.
Complex flavours of roasted malts, caramel malts, dark fruits, raisins, bready, very smooth and well balanced. 
Palate  - Moderate to high carb which is perfect for the beer, smooth. Finish is smooth, complex dark malts and dark fruits. Alcohol is very well hidden. Dangerously drinkable.
Overall - A world-class beer, superb. I really enjoyed this and it is so well blended  - but the taste is just not as complex as Rochefort 10 - I think there is less spiciness, less layers of flavour. Very, very impressed, but not mind-blowing. One to re-rate with a bottle at home.
Take 2 - Its good but not quite as good as I originally thought so its

The beer smells sweet and subtle with hints of wood, carmel and plums or raisins.

The night is slowly moving so I am going to end my rating there and say that the descriptions I have read of this beer are accurate. Its amazing but still doesnt compare to Westy 12 in my mind...

The aroma ia the only category in which I didnt give it a perfect score. I gave it 9 out of 10. The aroma is pleasant. Their are hints of fig, malt, goodness. Only Rochefort may have a better aroma.

This beer pours a brown, hazy chocolate like color. The head is off white and stands an inch high. The head lingers and coats the glass on its way down.

The taste is heavenly. I get figs, sweetness, fruity (but not too much so) and malty. Very limited alcohol taste for such a high alcohol brew. It dances on the tongue and is warm going down. The entire mouth regals with pleasure.

I love this beer. Its the overall most wonderful beer in my beer universe.

Im drinking this in a glass purchased at the brewery and the beer is bottle conditioned. Ive had this on tap only once, in Philadelphia. And I didnt like it. Something was lost in the kegging. Or, this bar, which I wont name, had bad keg lines. It wasnt as good as Im used to.

Smell - The smell of the beer is quite sweet and full bodied. I smelled raisins and plums. Very malty aroma. 

Taste - The beer was a little bitter when it first hit my tongue. The bittnerness mellowed out into a faint sweetness as it passed to the back of my mouth. I could taste raisins and plums as it went down. 

Mouthfeel - Pretty heavily bodied. The beer was very smooth though and pleasing.

Overall - This beer was quite good. It was not as good as a Rochefort 8 that I had, but it was still exquisite. A very well-brewed beer.

There is no one overriding falvour upon tasting. It has chocolate, nutty toastiness, ginger, glace fruit all at once. Then theres a tangy juicy fruitiness. It is one of the most complete palate I have experienced. This is a very special beer.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
2863,"2011-07-07",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2015 Beautiful brown beer with a tan, fizzy, quickly-disappearing head. The aroma is has an assertive alcohol presence that spoils an otherwise superb bouquet of dark fruits, yeast, spices, and caramel malts. The taste follows the aroma notes, with an equally boozy feel, but with more of a sour, citrusy note that I like very much. The palate is a bit thin and significantly carbonated, which makes for an easy-drinking brew that can be sipped but doesnt have to be. Going back to the abv, you DO feel it throughout, though it NEVER deters you from drinking on. Its quite easy to drink large quantities of this and you wont know youre getting drunk until you are. This is a very good beer that, in my book, lives up to its reputation. Its widely available, so theres no excuse for not giving it a try.
Update: I tried a more aged version and the alcohol edge has smoothed over wonderfully. Its a really drinkable beer, with an excellent fruity flavor and the yeast coming through spectacularly. I think I also detected a hint of anise, or otherwise something herbal and delicious. Ill have to bring the score up three notches.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

Rum, raisin, Belgian yeast & some fruity tang on the tongue, a bit of choccy fruit, mild roasted malt notes, light bready tones & a demerara sugar sweetness.

Will this match the expectation that is put upon it? Shall it be worthy of sharing this as I admire my best girls glorious butt-cheeks and the very best of Louis Prima vintage recordings on wind up stereo for thick records?
I pour and let the minimal head settle The aroma is sweet but not overly so. The color is of a fine Brazilian woman I was with years ago that remains a sacred memory of love and devotion; She had the most glorious butt-cheeks that held the same deep color that this St. Bernardus has. Yes the color of both the beverage and butt-cheeks was especially blessed.
I take my first sip and telling from my heart, this is quite delicious. Very complex with a medley of flavors such as the fine Louis Prima song The Music Goes Round and Around. Wonderful throughout the entire consumption I wish for more and the second sip is better than the first. The head remains velvety and smooth - such can only be compared to one of my best girls glorious asses, Vera - so very smooth with the texture of beautiful butt flesh cared for with the caution of the Hope Diamond.
The remaining portion of the glass represents all that is well and good in the world of beverages, music and fine women. Incredibly tasty, never to tire of and craving more and more Should I take but a few of each to an island for my remaining years, I would include this fine liquid along with the treasures of Louis Prima and my selection of best girls  this ale is worthy of such love to accompany the best things in life.","Alabama, USA","bartalone"

NOTE #2:   ""Abt 12"" is one bastard of a term to define.  ""Abt"" refers to ""Abbot,"" the highest ranked dude at the monastery, and thus the guy deserving of the most specialest beer ever.   The meaning of the ""12,"" however, was debated for centuries, causing much anger and spite between the Nine Houses Of Belgian Strong Dark Ales, or NineHoBelgoStroDarAle for short.  It wasnt until legendary bartender and beer explorer Massachusetts La Toose uncovered the Flemish Red Sea Scrolls that the true meaning of the 12 was found.  After nearly dying from the sheer awfulness of the pun in the scrolls title, La Toose translated the scrolls from his recovery bed, and uncovered the long sought-after truth:  ""12"" was, in fact not a 12 at all, but a poorly transcribed uppercase ""R"".  We still have no fucking clue what the ""R"" means.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

2863,"2011-02-12",4.6,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2013 11.2 oz yellow/baby blue labeled bottle. The hype on this beer is really high, I will try not to think of it in this review.

Gushes slightly when it is uncapped, but I sniffed the initial whiff (tropical fruit blast) and poured it before it over flowed, it was just a very slow gush. Pours with a nice 3 finger off white head into my Duvel glass. Head stays for a little while before receding. A blanket of foam still covers the liquid. The thick, creamy lacing/head has little specs in it.

The beer is a very dark, murky brown. There is a hint of red. Tons of little things, yeast and more, are floating around in there.

After letting the oxygen mingle with it for a while I give it a smell. It smells very rich, almost creamy. Has a ripe banana/plum/peach/dried apple scent, along with some bubble gum twang. Theres also some spices in there including clove and pepper. I can also smell a faint bit of chocolaty roasted malt and a kiss of hops. You can pick up on the alcohol a little bit, it prickles your nostrils ever so slightly and warms them.

The carbonation is really biting and I like it. Mouthfeel is utterly superb, some what thin at first but with a thicker, stickier smooth finish. This aids in the taste of a million flavors. Nice sweetness, though not too cloying, and the alcohol shows up just a bit, warming as it does down. Some nice roasted bitterness in the aftertaste. A massive flavor.

Overall, this is a great Trappist style ale, and for a quad it isnt too sweet. This is one you sit back, sip, and appreciate what the brewers have done.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

4.0 S: Dark fruits including plum and raisin. Slight graininess. Nuts, caramel, and some mild peppery spiciness.

5.0 T: I wasnt really too impressed with this beer until I tasted it. It is incredible. Flavors are much like the smell, just in overdrive. Plum, raisin, tobacco and a touch of over-ripe banana. Not as nutty, but lots of caramel and touches of pepper and clove.

4.5 M: Medium-heavy body. Bubbly carbonation and perhaps a tad too bubbly. Smooth finish with the alcohol hidden really well.

4.5 D: This is one hell of a tasty beer.

2863,"2011-01-12",3.6,"Deep brownish red, with huge head which dissipates quickly - typical for such high ABV.  Aroma is not as complex as I was expecting, mostly Belgian Yeast and alcohol, some fresh baked bread, and apple cider notes. Body is full with high fizzy carbonation. Taste is similar to aroma - apples, yeast, and yes, a whole lot of warming alcohol. Maybe a hint of anise or fennel from the complex yeast. Long complex finish with moderate hops to balance the sweet malts. I prefer the Prior 8, Pater 6, or Triple to this. It is so heavy and cloying that by the end of the 12 oz. bottle I was sick of it.

Au goût, le liquide permet de définir davantage son malt : pratiquement comme un morceau de toffee qui fond sur la langue.  Le caractère fruité est aussi imposant, avec des pointes chaudes et rondes de raisins et de figues qui me rappellent un bon vieux rhum.  Le fort degré dalcool se fait aussi sentir : sa présence freine judicieusement la douceur du malt et du sucre.

Murky brown body, medium off-white head. Aroma has yeast, brown sugar, some dried fruit. Very typical Belgian. Taste is plain and thin, mostly raisins and high booze. Tongue-numbingly overcarbonated, the subtle flavours that might have been there are now completely veiled by it and the thin mouthfeel is certainly not helping.

2863,"2010-10-23",4.4,"Poured from one of the small bottles into a St. Bernardus goblet that looks like an oversized wine glass. Muddy brown dubbel/quad appearance with excellent foam retention. Ill give it a little time to warm up - on this warm October day, it shouldnt take too long.

It smells like an enormous malt bomb, massive aromatic slabs of deep caramel, overripe plantain and rum raisin. Malt for miles and miles. 

While it smells very sweet, the taste has more going on than just pure sweet malt. It is moderately sweet up front, which is entirely appropriate, the sweetness of a rum-drenched dark banana bread. It is a little spicy, though perhaps not as clove-heavy as some of the other Belgians. Alcohol, while by no means overbearing, isnt afraid to poke its nose in at mid-palate and let you know its there. Dry-ish finish with a raisin aftertaste. 

While this is a full-bodied beer to say the least, it achieves the heavenly cloud-like Belgian mouthfeel like few others of this strength not named Rochefort 10 or Westy 12.

2863,"2010-10-20",4.4,"This was my second bottle of abt 12, however I did not take notes for the first one and so I wanted to have another before I rated it. Off the bat, the first bottle had a much stronger Aroma that captured my senses the instant the bottle was opened. Secondly the first bottle had a thick thick huge light BROWN head which I thought was awesome. 

This second bottle was poured into a trappist glass. Abt 12 is dark brown with a light tan head with tight bubbles. The aroma was spicy, earthy, malty, and fruity. I got pears cherries and figs. The taste was malty figgy and sweet. For the palate the abt 12 had a feel that reminds me of coca-cola and a finish of stingy spices.

2863,"2010-10-07",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2012 Anyone who is big into the craft beer scene knows Westvleteren 12 - a Trappist beer made by monks in Belgium and sold exclusively at the monastery - is the most sought-after beer. Most of those people have likely heard that St. Bernardus Abt 12 is either a ""clone"" or a very close replica of the famous ""Westy 12."" Having drank both beers I can tell you they are definitely different and the authentic Trappist brew is definitely superior. However, Abt 12 is still a very good beer in its own right and a lot easier to come by.APPEARANCE AND AROMAI poured an 11.2oz bottle into a Trappist chalice. I was amazed this beer produced a huge, fluffy, tan head. It was slow to dissipate and left nice lacing on the glass. The color is that typical Belgian shade thats not quite brown and not quite maroon, but very hazy.The aroma is also typical for a Belgian strong dark ale: alcohol, perfume, and dark fruits. Not nearly as aromatic or as inviting as an authentic Trappist, though. In fact, its surprisingly mild. TASTEBefore I comment on the taste, it should be noted that the bottle of St. Bernardus Abt 12 I drank was fairly fresh and had not been cellared. Beers like this age like wine and its almost a bit unfair to drink them young. That being said, theres still a lot of flavor to experience here and its still pleasantly satisfying.Much like Westy 12, St. Bernies is a fairly complex beer. The overall taste is a mélange of dark fruits like plum, apple, cherry and fig. Theres also a noticeable dryness to the finish and in the aftertaste due to the high alcohol content (and the fact my bottle was rather young). The palette opens up a bit as it warms, but only slightly. Its funny how a beer can have seemingly a variety of flavors, but the actual intensity is a bit muted. Its like listening to a symphony with the volume turned way down.DRINKABILITYBelgian strong dark ales tend to be an enduring experience of drinking due to their unbridled energy in the mouthfeel. Yet, Abt 12 was an amazingly easy beer to drink. I was surprised and delighted by the pillowy softness of the mouthfeel. Beers like this tend to act like Pop Rocks, but this beer slides across the tongue with amazing grace. Surprisingly, it is only a medium-bodied beer and has a lighter mouthfeel than youd expect.At 10% ABV, St. Bernies should be a beer to handle with caution, but the drinking experience would indicate otherwise. While there is definitely a sharp, dry, alcoholic presence to the taste, this isnt the kind of beer that must be sipped, nor is it the kind that overwhelms the drinker only halfway through. FINAL THOUGHTSSt. Bernardus Abt 12 is a beer that has pretty much everything going for it, including a reputation for being so similar to one of the worlds most revered beers. I almost want to give a perfect score, but I cant due to the absence of a true ""wow!"" factor. Maybe if I try a vintage version Ill change my mind.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Poured with a good bit of carbonation, dark murky orange pour with a big frothy white head.  The head faded down to a thick half finger after a few sips, good retention and left a lot of lace.  Aroma was lots of rich malts, some fruitiness from the yeast, grape bubblegum and caramel.  Hard to pick through all of the complex aromas.  Flavors started out with a fruitiness, then a big malt presence although not sweet, just big and malty with a subtle bitterness in the finish.  Had a fruity finish too.  This stuff is one of the smoothest drinking brews I have some across.  I didnt detect alcohol anywhere in this which was quite unreal.

2863,"2010-09-19",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2011 Ive had this beer twice now in the last six months, and while I dont have explicit notes to record here, I think I still have a good enough recollection, particularly from the second of the tastings, to post a review.  I have a bad habit, particularly after sampling several good beers, of taking note of whether or not I liked the beer, but not of why I liked it.  Because of the shortcomings of my recollection of my first tasting, I paid extra attention during the second.  So for a quad, I recall this being on the medium-dark brown end, with a healthy dust-colored head.  It looks beautiful.  As for the flavor, yes there were raisins and dates, but these excellent expressions of maltiness were comfortably shrouded by a somewhat more explicit simple sweetness, probably the result of a dark candi syrup.  On top of this, there is just a hint of spicy hop flavor and bitterness on the back of the tongue.  It is oh so pleasant!  Thanks for a great beer, if only I could have it more often!

Wow, this is overrated. I really dont see why this beer is so hyped. I have tried only a handfull of Abt/Quadrupel until now, but this has certainly been the lessest complex and most boring example of the style.  
It starts out quite well as a dark brown beer with a dense head. The aroma is a dissapointment, though, only being berries with alcohol and some anonymous hops.

2863,"2010-06-21",3.7,"Rating #200, finally! The moment I cracked this open, 1/3 of the beer gushed all over the floor of my apartment. Gotta love this... Anyway, heres what I wrote down after cleaning up:

Murky brown appearance due to all the CO2 being released, thin off-white head. Pungent vinous aroma, mild alcohol, plums, dark cherries and just a hint of lemons and green apples. Pretty caramelly as well. Soft and creamy mouthfeel, but not cloying at all - I was even a little surprised by the fairly ""thin"" mouthfeel. The alcohol is definitely beneficial in balancing the beer with dryness. The flavour is fruity as fruity as the aroma, malty (Munich malt?), slightly caramelly and yeasty. Very little bitterness. Overall, Id say this is a really nice sipper, but it didnt overwhelm me.","AUSTRIA","danielst"

I cellared it away for a few months, handled it with care, cooled it down to the serving temperature, but I guess it was just really happy to see me.  Lots of swirling yeast dancing around the bottle and glass - but hey, its Belgian.  Its a dark mahogany with a yellow-white head.  Aroma is more fruity than what is to be expected from a quad, or rather more lighter fruits here; apple skin, green grapes and unripe banana.  There is also a complex and wonderful spiciness.  Taste is a brown candy sugar, apple, cinnamon, a little bit of bready yeast and a tingle of alcohol.  It is amazingly well balanced, superbly so.  Its only let down is that the mouth feel is a tad thin.  Finish is cinnamon, sugar and apple - so very much like a rich apple crumble.  A classic.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","theSlipperyPen"

2863,"2010-05-11",4.7,"Rich browns, mahogany, and glints of amber gaze endearingly at me from their resting place in my glass while a khaki head bubbles and burbles its way into a firm collar. She swirls with lace and a decadent nose. Sweet and vinous, pumpernickel bread heavy and rich emerges from the bakers oven even as candied fruit bring to mind fruitcake. Why is that fruitcake tastes so horrible and yet the aroma of fruitcake in beer is so enticing? This is obviously one of the great mysteries of life to which we will never be privy. Red and black licorice waft in and out while a plate of fresh prunes, dates, raisins, black cherries and plums are lain out before me. There is a delicate port quality to the Abt. 12 which only matures with age; do be sure to cellar a few bottles. Treacle and tobacco leaf wrap up her nose and I am ready to move into the quaffing stage. In fact, I was born ready to drink this beer. As with most St. Bernardus beers, her mouthfeel is rich and frothy with a boisterous bubbliness which settles down some with time in the bottle and/or in your glass. Prunes, raisins, and pumpernickel great me first, adding to her full and slightly chewy mouthfeel. Ah... just as good as I remember. Fruitcake and candied fruit bring a smile to my lips even as her fermentable sugar sweetness leads into the more earthy richness of licorice and tobacco leaf. Cinnamon sprinkles hither and fro as a rosy glow permeates my chest thanks to her lofty ABV. She slowly grows dry in her finish which is enhanced by further notes of cinnamon, wood, and tobacco leaf lingering long in my breath. Each quaff leaves a luscious coating of treacle-dipped raisin and prune on my lips for a truly smacking occasion. St. Bernardus Abt. 12 is best enjoyed at cellar temperature, each quaff a palatial revelation, and so I cede pen and paper to pure selfish enjoyment.


Dont believe me? Wait not and grab a bottle. Many may wax lofty poetic praise on the Chimay Blue, but for me, the St. Bernardus Abt. 12 is the Belgian Quadrupel where all Belgian Quadrupels are at. Always great. Always humble. Always mine.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

A - Deep hazy brown with a red hue. Good sized creamy, and tan head. Good amount of lacing left over.

S - Sweet bready malt paired with dark sugar and molasses. Dark fruit (plum, raisin, date, cherry) and licorice. Also a good amount of spice, specifically clove.

T - Similar to smell, with a lot of dark bready malts and dark sugar along with the above mentioned fruit make up a large amount of the taste. Also the spices (clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, anise) are quite prevalent. Alcohol is quite hidden, although there is a hint of it.

M - Full to medium body with adequate carbonation. Really creamy and smooth.

D - Really nice to sip. Smooth creamy and full, and provides a warming, but not necessarily all from the alcohol. Sweet but not cloying, really complex and a new flavor every sip provides a new mix of flavors.

Its a beautiful beer, with complex colors ranging from burnt orange to copper to mocha and lots of points in-between. Aroma is certainly soft and genuine -- it smells quite similar to the way it tastes -- but theres something abstract missing from it. Its tasty, for sure -- earthy fruits (raisins for sure), barnyard-esque (in an open-air pastoral sort of way -- idyllic Irish or something), perhaps too focused on the sweetness, and some hints of bitterness. It coats the tongue and lingers, but the mass produced caramel candy aftertaste cheapens the experience.

Light but sweet flavor. Some roasted sugary pear like flavor. I think this beers biggest downfall is calling itself a A dubble. It falls way short of that namesake and because of that becomes a disappointment. Like someone else stated somewhere, its a macros attempt at a craft beer and it comes up short imo.

2863,"2010-01-31",4.5,"Appearance: Pours a murky deep brown (borderline black). An inch or so of off-white, foamy head lasts a good while, so long in fact that it was a bit annoying. The head is quite dense and frothy.

Aroma: Not very aromatic due to the massive, thick head. With some swirling and settling I caught a little bit of the dark fruit notes. Smells a bit like dry champagne to me, maybe a touch of alcohol.

Taste: What a complex beer we have here! First hit with dark fruit flavors, reminded me of red wine so I thought maybe grapes, currants, cherries or plums. I get a slight taste of some malts in there but the carbonation really brings out the fruit above all else. Not much bitterness if any. Aftertaste dominated by a dry alcoholic taste.

Palate: Good effervescence makes for a crisp, dry finish but overall the beer goes down smooth and is perfectly balanced in the mouth.

Overall: Definitely a new favorite, excellent Belgian ale in every way. The interesting esters and hints of malt combined with the ability to hide an ABV of 10% make this a deceptively drinkable brew.

As the beer warms, the bitterness fades and the deep fruits become more pronounced. This tastes young, like it would improve with some aging...","Heerlen, NETHERLANDS","jnelson_22"

Probably the richest smelling beer Ive known, caramel/toffee and cloves, mostly. Those are also on the tongue, plus some fruits (but maybe as much apples and berries as plums and figs). Slightly boozy. Lots of bubbles, but theyre all small. Vaguely rustic, very rich and very, very good.","Rochester, New York, USA","McGarnigle"

2863,"2010-01-04",4.0,"Dark reddish brown with a medium-sized tanned head. Great head retention and lots of lacings.

The smell is full of fruit esters - blackberries, figs, plums and apples. Very impressive. Sweet dark malts and notes of fudge, grass and yeast.

The taste is very balanced and complex. Sweet dark malts and fruity flavors (figs, plums, apples) up front. Caramel, gentle spices, dry wood and a hint of yeast. A hint of chocolate. The finish has a nice bitter twist to it with plenty of malt aromas, lingering fruit esters and warming and well integrated alcohol. A very tasty brew.

Medium to full bodied, very smooth texture despite generous amounts of carbonation.

This is one of those Belgians that are just unbelievably balanced and tasty. Although Ive had lots of beers I like better, theres something about a beer like this that makes them come out almost as perfection in a bottle - everything is at its place and I wouldnt want to change a thing.

The color is a dark black with about two fingers of brownish foamy head. some lacing of the glass.

The smell is sweet but a bit musky, gives me visions of trees or leaves falling. A hard core flavor apple and a little bit of clove.

The taste is malty with some dried fruits. There is some pear flavor mixed with a bit of a creamy/sugary flavor that gives out a great kiss the the senses.

2863,"2009-11-08",3.5,"09 bottle Pours a hazy golden brown with a large creamy head that lingers. A sweet and mellow fruit nose followed by a distinct alcohol note. Im afraid that I may not be treating this newly bottled beer fairly as it was opened immediately after drinking my first Westy 12 - a bottle that was at least a year and a half old, and a Three Philosophers that was a year old. The St. Bern seems shallow and one dimensional by comparison with the two beers that preceded. Malt and grain flavors dominate with some fruity prune flavors mingling with molasses in the mid palate. Its a good dry finish, but doesnt leave me any lingering flavors to remind me of something new. Looking back, I probably should have pulled one from the cellar with a little age on it for this rating. Ill return for a re-rate if I discover something different in my next taste of this one.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","allendodd"

I have had several of these and it just hasnt grown on me the way I thought it would. Its taste is complex but not very balanced... has too much booze at the start and too much of a sweet aftertaste.

Pours a deep ruby brown with a full four fingers of frothy off-white head which leaves impressive lacing.  Aroma has nice sweet fruit (plum, cherry), bready malts, yeast, and some spice.  Flavor is the richest of sweet malts, sweet ripe dark fruit, buttery caramel, and lovely spice.  Medium-full body with a nice lingering caramel flavor in the finish.

Taste is heavy on the brown sugar at first, though as it warms, raisins, clove and molasses show up to balance that out. As with other (good) Quads, it shows a lot of different profiles. At one point, I swear it tasted like liquid banana bread.

2863,"2009-10-30",4.4,"So I was at a liquor store simply for a tasting and was NOT going to buy anything. I had my two and a half year old with me. Right before I left, she was being very squirmy and I set her down. She ran over and grabbed a bottle of Abt 12 and said ""Here daddy, beer for you!"". Now once again, I was not going to buy anything, but when even a two and a half year old knows about Abt 12...

Poured from bottle into my large Goblet.

Very dark reddish-brown with lots of floaties (I poured everything in as I like the yeast). Very foamy, sticky head that mostly subsides.

Aroma of plums, raisins, cloves and a definite musty smell.

I get a predominate taste of musty dark fruit - that sounds bad but its not. Strong notes of clove, molasses, butter and alcohol are also evident.

Moderate carbonation, very chewy but relatively light all things considering. Very warming from the alcohol.

Sip, sip, sip. No matter how good this beer is, I would have a hard time really wanting a second one. Of course, it is still fantastic.

Despite everything great I have heard, I still prefer some other Quads/Strong Darks, such as Scaldis Noel and Delirium Nocturnum.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

The flavor is overwhelmingly boozey at first followed with more subtle notes of sweet chewy malts, a bit of the dates coming through, and brown sugar.  The finish is rather warming, yet complex.  Overall, the over-the-top amount of booze simply detracted from the beer.  It was difficult to pick out other flavors simply because the alcohol was just way too overbearing.

ReRate.  Pours a murky ruddy with a creamy head that just sits and never really goes away.  Beautiful legs left on the side of the glass.  Aroma rich in plums and candied and browned sugars, deep dark fruits like dates are very noticeable in the aroma.  It just has this ""deep"" dark murky sense to it.  The flavor is much better this time around.  The overwhelming booziness is not present as it was before.  This time, this reminds of me of chocolate covered raisins, even a bit of tootsie-roll in there.  The deep dark dates and plums are fantastic alongside the sweet candied sugar and chewy malts.

After drinking dozens of these Ive finally gotten around to reviewing instead of drinking this heavenly concoction for pure enjoyment.

Pours out a massive, permanent bubbly tan head that sticks to the glass like glue and leaves Guinness-like rings. Dark brown muck in my glass after the sediment dump. Ahhhh. The aroma is simply awesome and makes me drool almost every time I get a whiff. The mix is perfect, lots of variety and seems to rotate with what is featured from smell to smell. Tons of stuff here: sweetness overlooks everything in good order, raisins, plums, cloves, salty bread, molasses, rich malts, fig newtons (I think - its been years since Ive had one), mild licorice, maybe artificial grape flavouring, caramel. I wonder if I can keep smelling this until it evaporates? Love the spice here, mellow but prominent. At this cellared age there is no alcohol on the nose at all. Then again, Im not sure if a fresh bottle has that as a aromatic characteristic either. All the 12s Ive had in the last 2 years have all been cellared.

My mouth just came. The flavours come in waves that continue to happify (new word!) my mouth. The sweetness begins but almost instantly allows the initial mild spice to roll along the tongue. This is only to prepare you for the impressive rich malt middle. This is only there in passing in its own right as the next wave of stronger, harsher spices and bitterness sweep over that and then grab hold of your taste buds, squeezing tight, reminding them that all those other beers theyve enjoyed do not even deserve to be uttered in the same sentence as ST. Bs 12. Sweet dark fruits, rich malts, licorice, molasses, brown sugar, back or the side of my tongue gets a shot of tartness. Yeast. Now that Ive said that, I never realized how I was ignoring the yeast factor until now. Its there without question. Breathe in the spice and realize there is a faint alcohol vapour circling within. Smooth, medium to medium full bodied, all encompassing in my mouth with the flavours seeking every nook and cranny. Finishes with some yeast, dark fruity sweetness and the perfect spice portion and it all blends in with a bitterness that, after quite a while, fades into a weak caramel that melts away much in the same way as a shadow does in late morning sun. This is it. This is THE beer experience as it should be. ABT 12 sits upon its throne above tens of thousands of beers and hundreds of imitators among the fabled Gods of Beer - casually pausing to consider... but only casually.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Pours like a loaf of hearty whole-grain or pumpernickel from a 750 into an Ommegang goblet - head has a meringue-like consistency. Nice, light/moderate carbonation. Essence of pine, nutmeg and sweeter spice flavors with moderate hop presence. This tastes like a quintessential Belgian. Deep, soulful yeast/malt presence with well-balanced sweetness, hop and alcohol presence. As time passes it provides the warming feeling of Thanksgiving dinner with even a hint of sweet potatoes and roasted carrots (I know, now Im really full of $#!+ - maybe its the power of suggestion). The carbonation is moderate, inoffensive and pleasant. This is all-encompassing, powerful wonderful stuff. Coats the mouth like a warm, almost-savory dessert and has the warming power of spiked hot chocolate in a ski lodge. For all its power it drinks very easily.

2863,"2009-06-06",3.7,"11.2 oz. bottle.  As soon as I popped the top on this one beer came shooting out!  What was left poured an opaque deep brown with a tall, foamy, off-white head.  Ripe fruit, a bit of yeast, and booze in the nose.  High carbonation but a light, dry mouthfeel.  Boozy fruit, dark honey, dark cherry, and a bit of earth on the palate.  Big and boozy, but dry and delicious.  Short, clean finish with a little bit of ripe fruit lingering.  Strangely it isnt as great as I thought it would be and the fountain-o-beer I received when I opened it makes me wonder if there was a slight infection.  I will definitely give this one another try in the future.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

2863,"2009-05-28",3.9,"11 oz bottle.  Pours like cola with a thin, lasting, french vanilla (with cinnamon) head.  Spritely aroma of bread, spice, vanilla extract.  Subtle, initially bitter taste gives way to grapfruit and plums, and sugary sweetness.  It is very smoothe (the alcohol can hardly be felt), and the lasting tingle of the high carbonation is pleasant.  My only complaint is that there is something that tastes off to me in the palate and finish, almost like this beer either needed more, or a lot less, time in the bottle.  Could just be that my taster is maladjusted.  This is a very fine beer, and I am going to finish enjoying it now.","San Diego, California, USA","gorditoabd"

Rich and creamy, the alcohol is ever-present. A little oily in the body. The aftertaste reminds me of a swallow of brandy. The flavor has some hard-stone fruit tones, such as plum and cherry.

The story of this beer is the alcohol, which I find distracting. IMHO, the dilemma with Quads is that they are made extreme without placing stronger flavors in the brew (like darker malts or more hops). So, I find these to be a little too one-dimensional.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","smcolw"

IN YOUR FACE yeast character, though nothing offensive, just very dominant.  Malt profile is impeccable, sweet but not cloying, body is soft and delicate.  There are earthy notes in the body that Id prefer a softer yeast to be able to detect, but this is at least on par with Roquefort.  One of the best Ive had.","Jonesboro, Arkansas, USA","thefederalist"

Sampling notes:
Served lightly chilled in chalice.
Major gusher! Not cool! Murky bronze body with the remants of what was probably a very nice tight offwhite head.
Rich aroma, plenty of bread, dried fruit particularly sultana, fig and prune, some vinous berries and spice.
Smooth, rich palate, silky on the tongue, fantastic length. Carbonation seems low, probably due to the initial gush. Very deceptive alcohol indeed!
Lovely smooth, rich caramel body, with some rich cake and burnt toffee in there. Followed by a well balanced attack of ripe and dried fruits, not to mention spice and malt complexities. Figs seem prominant, as does pepper and ripe pears. The list could go on, but it could get lengthy! Smooth finish, a lingering ripe fruit, alcohol a whiff on the breath, no more.
Huge shame this was a gusher, because i recall it being so much better. Having said that, this is amazingly well balanced yet complex ale, one of the best around!","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

2863,"2009-03-07",4.5,"St. Bernardus ABT 12

11.5 oz bottle. Poured a deep reddish amber with a large foamy light-tan head, leaving moderate lacing throughout. The head was so dramatic as to warrant extra care on my part upon opening to avoid spillage, and spillage with this beer is nothing short of sinful. To put it frankly, St. Bernardus ABT 12 is the greatest beer I have ever tasted, surpassing Chimay Grande Reserve, Westmalle Dubbel, and perhaps even Gulden Draak, which had previously held something of a tie for my favorite beer. This divine ale carried aromas of cedar and warm malts, as well as a hint of the bold fruit notes inherent in the flavor. The accents carried dramatic flavors of pear, banana, and apple, as well as alcohol, cedar, hickory, and Danish bleu. The mouthfeel was especially pleasing - thick, creamy, and smooth with only mild bitterness considering its ABV. The only drawback (and quite a trivial one it is) is a slightly silty appearance. But who said a beer has to be beautiful to taste fantastic? The beer was very fittingly accompanied by a plate of organic dark wheat bread and some Australian Roaring 40s cows milk blue cheese (which was, coincidentally, also the greatest blue cheese I have ever tasted). *For posteritys sake I wrote this review prior to eating the bread and cheese, so the Danish bleu accents aforementioned were strictly from the beer. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.","Florida, USA","aco2"

Aroma is spicy-strong alcohol and dark fruits with a bit of a grain flavor. Flavor is like a black plum with wheat and a bit of hops. Overall a lighter flavor than the Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren 12; the former has an overripe banana kick, the latter has a smoky licorice and leather bite. Bernardus has nothing specific; it doesnt have the distinctive character or long-lasting savor of those beers, so those who cant stand too strong a flavor will find this quad easier to take. Decent, definitely conforms to the Belgian style of beers, but personally, Id take a Storm King Stout or a Corsendonk Christmas Ale or an Achel Extra Bruin over this anyday. It just doesnt stand out from the crowd. I would, however, definitely recommend this beer to people who arent used to the Belgian flair and cant get their hands on a Rochefort or, better yet, Westy 12.

I dont really agree with some of the excitement shown by some fellow raters, "" best beer in the world"" and all that.","Wilton, New Hampshire, USA","mcox90"

The aroma hits the nose hard with cloves, toffee and sweet dark fruit aromas (plum/raisin).  Flavor is truly fantastic.  The beer has a very strong alcohol kick to it but this seems to emphasis the clove flavor very well.  Sweet dark fruit tones are present in the flavor and when combined with its maltiness make it a very smooth beer.

2863,"2009-01-10",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 18, 2009 My dear god, what a beer. Most notably is the palate, it coats every inch of your mouth and stays with you, adding more flavors every minute. It supplies mostly a dignified, pruney flavor common to many Belgian and Trappist ales, but this one has so more identifiable spices in the mix. It is a beautiful dark brown, cloudy.

2863,"2009-01-10",4.9,"Presentation: Drank from an 11.2 oz bottle, poured into Watou brewery chalice. Bottle has a drawing of a balding monk with a very good beer in his hand. 

Appearance: In my limited experience, this sets the standard for strong dark ales. A deep orange-brown color, almost completely opaque. The head never really disappears from the top of the beer. 

Smell: This beer smells better than the smell of any other beer which my nose has smelled. Smells like fresh bread, with strong malty tones. 

Taste: This is possibly the best-tasting beer Ive tried to date. If I go fat and bald from drinking this beer, its worth the price. God bless the monks from Westvleteren, who apparently created the recipe for this beer. God bless also the brewers at Watou who make this intense stuff. The beer is full-bodied, and leaves a coating in your mouth (a good thing). Im not that good at picking out individual flavors, but I can taste sweet fruity flavors (plums, grapes, and bananas) with malt (chocolate and bread). I poured this below the temperature recommended on the bottle (52-56°F), and I think the taste becomes more intense as the liquid warms.",", Ohio, USA","TurdFurgison"
2863,"2009-01-08",4.1,"Huge gushing cinnamon head that descends slowly. Initial notes of raisin, sweet barley sugar, dark stone fruits and a slighty musty mushroom fragrance. As the beer warms further this complex aroma comes to the forefront. Colour is an almost opaque chocolate and coffee brown with only mild translucency at the margins of the glass. 

Tastes are initially dark woods, raisins, molasses, very sweet fruits and slighty aggressive alcoholic highlights that leave a pleasantly warm sensation behind the eyes. The mouth feel is very enjoyable - the sweetness coats the mouth like dissolving fairy floss. Subjectively, the potent sugars make this brew a strong competitor to the Trappist Rochefort (in which this aspect is more restrained), but the St Bernardus is still a delightful ale.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Gimcrack"

Blind tasting (alongside Westvleteren 12, Rochefort 8 and 10, and Chimay Blue)
Deep reddy brown, creamy beige head. Marzipan is the dominant component in the aroma, almond too, and some perfume which sweetens it. Walnut too. Soft carbonation, very velvetty palate. Maybe some alcohol showing. In the mouth, there is loads of almonds rising up retronasally, but less come through in the taste. Simple roasty graininess, and a touch of glue. With yeast, there is more roastiness, and without yeast there is more fruitiness and esters, which are beautifully heady. I think I prefer it with the yeast though, as the roast maltiness is well worth emphasising.

2863,"2008-10-18",3.5,"Carbonation swells up out of the bottle and thoroughly disturbing the chunky layer of sediment in the bottle--no chance for a clear beer here.

Dark fruit esters in the aroma with caramel malt and spicy hops along with dates, spicebread, and some alcohol sweetness.  More dates and dried figs in the flavor with a dark caramel and molasses maltiness.  Additional general spicy hop flavors and fermentation esters.  Though hints at some complexity here, it end result is not terriblycompelling.  The flavors tend to die out in the light, somewhat watery mouthfeel.  This impression is confusing, however, because of the high alcohol content--it is well hidden.

It was hard not giving this great beer a perfect score. It pours a murky redish light brown with an off white thick but dissapating head that leaves a mighty fine lace. The aroma is amazing. Bananas and prunes, and yet so much more that I can’t put my finger on. And the flavor...mmmmm...it’s fruity and balanced well with hops. Yeah, theyr’e there. The reasin that I gave a 9 for flavor is that the alcohol is quite detectable where I think it could be hidden a little more. The palate has a nice dry, lasting bitterness. With an alcohol sting.

Very buttery, just a little sweet. Currants, I think. Perhaps melon. Just a whisper of something sweeter, like nectarines, perhaps. And yeasty as well, so the effect is like a fresh baked Christmas cake. The flavor is full but not strong. More like toffee than fruity bread. But some of the fruit still comes through in the finish.

Appearance: Pours a near opaque, dark brown body with a full, cascading, and lasting, ivory-colored head. Sea foam lacing on the way down.

Smell: Aromatic blend of stewed, spiced fruit, liqueur, and chopped up chocolate cookies and candy bars.

Taste: First and foremost, its fruity, tasting of golden raisins, plum juice, and candied figs. Then you get some maltiness, mainly dark chocolate and nutty caramel. Hit of dark candi sugar. Not really much in the way of hops here. Touch of clove and nutmeg. Sip of creme de cocoa. Maybe a bit of fresh, oily orange zest. Finishes malty, sweet, and rather warming.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Moderately carbonated.

Drinkability: Paired very well with some Pinback mp3s (particularly ""Tripoli"" and ""Seville""). Full of flavor, rich complexities, and yet its easily accessible and generally readily available from coast to coast. Whats not the like?

Boy was this different. it’s almost like taking an incredible beer and mixing it with what we all used to think of as being beer before we had good beer. And I don’t mean Bud. I mean when someone had a German or other European import that isn’t excellent  but was way better than crap beer. Oops I meant macro beer. So in other words exotic yet accessible. There seems to be a lot of German in this Belgian ale. Both are present but it’s still Belgian. Hid alcohol well. Overall I’m not impressed. It was a nice beer, but I thought it would be incredible.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a murky to muddy, medium to dark reddish orangey brown with small and large body particles of an average density and a small to average, off-white head that mostly diminished. The aroma was light to moderate molasses, moderate doughy yeast, apple, cherry, brown sugar, a little spice, fruity, slight citrus and ever so slight alcohol. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and lightly bitter; while the finish was lightly acidic and moderately bitter with an average duration. There was yeasty dough, molasses, maybe toffee, some fruit like apple and cherry some spices, but also something more. The medium body was oily, yet also a little syrupy with very fizzy carbonation and a moderate alcoholic and dry finish. It went down easier the warmer it got.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

2863,"2008-07-28",3.9,"330mL bottle from an in person trade. I was excited to get to try this one. Pours a dark, murky brown with plenty of yeast sediment floating around, and a huge beige head. The aroma is very yeasty, not all that complex, just the usual dark fruity esters and a touch of booze, but still pretty nice. The flavour is sort of a mixed bag every sip I take. Sometimes more harsh than others, but generally gets better as it goes along.  Yeasty and boozy, but also some nice prune and date notes. Very smooth and silky feel to it, which I like. Very sweet and malty, but I wouldnt call it terribly complex, but thats not to say it isnt good. Gets much better as it warms, and the warming feeling from the alcohol isnt harsh at all, but very much evident. Im not really sure what else to say about it, its well done, but I guess it only really gains any major complexity with significant age. All in all a good one Im glad to have, and one worth trying.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

Big sweet and massively complex aromas.  There’s belgian yeast, sugar, plums, bubble gum, nuts...extremely pleasing to the nose.

Taste is just as complex as the nose with sweet malts, yeast, dark fruits and even a little chocolate.  The layers of flavors just keep coming and leave a wonderfully sweet aftertaste that lingers pleasantly on the tongue.

Mouthfeel is truly exceptional.  Perfect medium to full body with high carbonation that tickles the tongue with the myriad of flavors.  Creamy and delightful.

2863,"2008-06-17",4.0,"Subtle raisin/fig/fruit scent. Deep, dark, opaque reddish-brown with a bubbly, off-white head that leaves some lacing, but not as much as I expected. Some carbonation, but it doesnt hit you too hard. Taste is malty, fruity and alcoholic with no bitterness. Subtle finish. Ive tasted many dubbels, and although its not my favourite style this one is quite good.","Massachusetts, USA","BeerEssential"
2863,"2008-06-16",4.0,"The beer pours an amber red thats so deep it is almost brown it has a good rocky head with large bubbles that settles slowly and leaves little lacing. The nose is light with a mix of caramel, some yeast, dark fruit and malts. The taste is rich; mixing sweet malts and dark fruit with alcohol and some bitterness. The beer is very tight in both flavor and palate making it rich but still balanced. A very good deep dark beer.","Sugarland, Texas, USA","texasbartender"
2863,"2008-06-15",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2009 33cl bottle from Total Wine (Tampa). Pours a dark brown to black with a one finger head that is retained throughout consumption. Aroma: malt, candy sugar, alcohol, molasses, spice. Tastes sweet, malty, and sugary with hints of maple syrup. Full-bodied ale with a sweet, lingering finish. We tasted this bottle with a 33cl bottle of Westvleteren 12. The St. Bernardus had a creamier mouthfeel and was somewhat lighter in color than the Westy 12. The Westvleteren 12, however, was slightly better balanced than the St. Bernardus with a fuller-bodied mouthfeel, less sugar, and well-hidden alcohol. Given the history between these two beers, it is no wonder they are very similar. Both are exceptional ales.","Tampa, Florida, USA","kiefdog"

Smells like fresh banana bread soaked in dark rum topped with toasted marshmallow cream- or maybe pineapple upside down cake covered in caramel. This beer is dessert- such a smooth mixture of fruity flavors and mild hoppiness- alcohol is not at all hot, quite masked in fact. Dangerous beer- top notch.","Graham, North Carolina, USA","gueuzeisgod"

A decent head that does not last very long with little to no lacing.  Huge particles floating in the mix.  Dark reddish brown beer.  Moderately sweet flavor.

Medium to slightly full bodied with average carbonation that finishes with a good amount of alcohol warming on the back the throat and only the slightest hint of dryness in your mouth. Flavor of rotting banana, vanilla extract, some dark fruit, red wine and sherry from the alcohol. As nice and enjoyable as this was the alcohol was still very up front and needs some time to mellow.

2863,"2008-05-14",4.4,"On tap at The Bavarian Lodge, Lisle, IL into Trappist glass.  (This was beer #2 from a night of enjoying real rarities on tap.  It took a Tyroler Schnitzel and lots of rye bread to get me back on track for the ride home!)
A raisiny, ruby-brown with a chunky, lacy white head.  Aroma is heavy on dark fruits like raisin, cherry, etc., plus a slight alcohol tingle and some nice balancing maltiness.  A wonderful aroma!  Flavor was a tart, sweet, rich fruity and malty joy.  Blew out whatwas left of my taste buds after drinking the De Dolle ""Mad Bitch"" earlier in the evening.  Alcohol was evident, but not so much as to make one think it was a 10.5% beast.  The alcohol evident was more of a reminder of the fermented goodness that was present.  Palate was thick but clean.  Wonderful flavors lingered.  In a way this almost reminded me of a Central or Eastern European cordial.  Overall, another great beer that I was lucky enough to try on tap.

11/22/09 - Rather shoddy looking brown body, floaties galore and a very weak thin head. Aroma is watery tea, nut, raisin, and wood.

Pours a deep chestnut with a large, rocky head, much larger than I expected when it opened so calmly.  The aroma is very light and smooth with a sweet, fruity, yeasty character.  The taste starts sweet and fruity, like raisins or dates.  It quickly turns into a nice, malty mouthful with whiskey notes.  The alcohol comes through strong in the finish and leaves a dry aftertaste.  Very good.","Georgia, USA","emarkd"

2863,"2008-04-15",4.0,"One of the quintessential Belgian beers.  Pours from the 11.2oz bottle a nearly opaque deep maple brown color with a frothy, lacing dirty tan head.  One of a kind aroma that has a strong sweet, candy aroma mixed with some sour yeastiness, with fruity aromas like grape and plum.  Flavor is very similar with a strong sweet malt flavor that is a mix of hard candy and brown sugar.  Flavor has more grain than I had imagined with a bit of barnyard funk to round things out.  Medium mouthfeel with a lasting sweetness that hides the alcohol well.  This brew is a lesson in balance all while maintaining its complexity.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"

The head is thick and creamy, with a tan color that leaves good lacing. The aroma is full of cherries, earthy yeast and dried fruits, as well as intoxicating liquor smell. The warming alcohol is bold and up front with roasted malts and some bitter hops. As you continue to sip the dark fruits come out.

Aroma first hits me with blue grape bubllegum then some kiwi notes, a touch of iron, vanilla and pepper. The blue grape comes to mind in the flavor as well, since it is sweet, a little acidic and it finishes on tannic and alcohol bitterness. Very fruiy indeed. Heavy carbonation gives it a medium body with a silky soft mouthfeel.

A very delicate and balanced blend of rich toasty and carmely malts, dried fruit notes, soft/doughy yet a little tart yeastiness and a touch of alcohol in the finish.  Malt and yeast really take over when you first sip followed by the fruits and the alcohol in the (dry) finish.  However, for 10% the alcohol is suprisingly faint.  A very drinkable, big belgian ale.

When cold, aroma that was very fruity but overly sweet, a bland, almost soda flavor, and a palate wrecked with way too much carbonation. However, upon warming, all awesomeness ensues. The nose was a blend of all that fruitiness along with notes of honey, toffee, coffee (these latter two being gentle but making their presence well known at the same time), and less sweet notes of dried fruits in the area of figs and dates. The flavor and palate were simply perfect. Everything came together in perfect harmony, the absurd carbonation had mellowed, the alcohol was absolutely non-existent, and I got the distinct sense that if any one flavor were added or subtracted the beer would be ruined.

The mouth-feel is incredible, its thick almost syrupy, but that thickness is quickly cut through by the carbonation and the alcohol. This is truly a standout beer.

It tastes a little bit like apples too, but more like the apples that you dont use for eating or making juice, more like the dryer apples that people have traditionally used for making booze.

The aroma is pleasant, but very reserved - a bit fruity and malty with some subtle citrus notes. The flavor is a very complex mix of fruits and malt sweetness with a tongue tingling alcoholic bite. Although the alcohol is noticeable, it  is well balanced with the other flavors. The palate is very smooth.

Lacing like a wedding dress. Mouthfeel medium to sticky. Flavor is slightly more subtle. Clean apple highlights the fruit basket, candy, caramel, and raisin. Alcohol is fairly present, but not enough to detract for me. Its a situation thing though. We had a tasting one night where we came off some goldens and triples into this and the alcohol bite was staggering. I would think aging this beer would make it an almost perfect beer. I would put the nose higher than any Trappist other than Orval, and an equal to the LaTrappe and Achel Quads. Classic.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","BritAlesRule"
2863,"2008-02-27",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 25, 2008 Had a mini quad tasting in April 07. Had this one first.

Picked up this 12 oz bottle at Champanes in Warren MI.

Appearance: Pours a nice and clear brown color with a 1 finger tan head. There is a little bit of lacing on my snifter.

Aroma: Starts with some nice malts and a slight alcohol burn. This is followed by dark fruits, figs, roasted malts, and slight cherry. The aroma on this was a little more pronounced than the Westy12 and less than the Rochefort 10. Very nice and inviting.

Flavor: The tastes are similar to the aroma, but not a noticable. Cherry and dark fruits from the start followed by warming alcohol and some spicy hops.

Palate: The dark fruit and malt flavors hang for a bit. This is pretty creamy too and also goes down too smooth for 10%. A 4 pack of this would be no problem, but splitting this bottle is nice too.

Overall. This finished behind the Rochefort 10 and Westy 12 in this tasting and slightly above the Chimay Blue. I aged a 750ml of this for a few years and it was incredible. It was probably all 5s or damn close if I rated it. The 750s are quite a bit better than the 12 oz bottles IMO. In other tastings, this finished ahead of the Rochefort 10, but not this time. Truely a world-class beer (as were the others). Definitely pick some up....and age a few.","Allen Park, Michigan, USA","northernbrews"

Nice rich dark aroma, dates and raisins, and dark caramel, maybe a hint of cinnamon. The flavor is even better, beautifully integrated after almost three years, dark chewy caramel, the expected dark dried fruits, a late hint of chocolate cake. The mouthfeel is simply sublime. Incredibly creamy, perfectly carbonated with tiny bubbles, no hint of alcohol, very full but not the least bit sticky.

The Belgians clearly have the quadrupel down pat. Westy 12, Rochy 10 and now Berny 12 (yeah I have pet names for them, so what) have really highlighted the craftsmanship of Belgian ales to me.

In the mouth it was medium to full-bodied with a denisity and weight that was full bet extremely well-balanced by the effervecance.  In fact the effervecance keeps this very light on its feet for such a high alcohol and powerful beer.

Pours a very dark brown with an almost creamy off-white head leaving traces of lacing around the glass. At first the head dissipated leaving little islands on the beer and somehow gained strength and filled out the glass for a head all around. Pretty strong yeasty aroma, wow, plum, raison, cherries, and maybe even some grapes. Pretty strong, yet complex smell. Taste is full of the same dark fruit, just dancing on the tongue, be prepared. To dig deeper, it starts with a caramel and biscuit flavor then transforms seemlessly into a plum/raison flavor and finishes with a bit of dark cherry flavor. Slightly above average carbonation, with a medium to full body, pretty nicely paired together, maybe a little less carbonation would be better. Very wonderful to drink, but I cant imagine being able to stand after a few of these.

One of those beers that seems to get better and better with every sip, provided you sip slowly and infrequently.  Seems like I stumbled upon one of the better bottles.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","sheatripper"
2863,"2007-11-09",3.9,"Vintage 2005 - tasted fall 2007. Pours a dark brown with a minimal head. Aroma of spice, liquorice and caramel. The palate is fat and creamy, and the flavour immense of malt sweetness.","Odense, DENMARK","Blom"
2863,"2007-11-06",4.3,"Bottle, 33cl. Hazy, brown pour with a good dash of floaties, and a big, lasting, creamy, beige head. The aroma left a slightly oxidized impression that vanished after some seconds, being replaced by a nice, vinous blend of dried fruits, sugar, alcohol, a little spicy touch, ripe red plums, some yeast and some berries. The flavor started with caramel, chocolate and roasted malt, soon to have company by dried fruits, sugar, a little alcohol burn that got more evident towards the end, a nice bitterness and a yeasty note. To follow the alcohol in the finish, theres bitterness and sweetness, dried fruits and a little spicyness, as well as some caramel. It is, as mentioned, warming in the mouth, but it feels a bit thin for an abt. Of course its not thin, but I would like it to be fuller, the fullness sort of disappeares rather quickly, leaving an empty feeling in the mouth, even though the carbonation is still there, and the finish is doing what it should. Theres also some cellar notes in the flavor, and nice lacings paint the side of the glass. A fine brew, but a bit disappointing on the mouthfeel. (071106)","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

2863,"2007-11-02",4.7,"Small bottle poued in a trappist glass @ 47 degrees F.  Pours a deep cloudy brown with a creamy coffee colored head.  The lacing on the glass as the head dissipates is very evident.  The aroma is a blend of belgian yeast, raisins, and roasted chocolate.  The anticipation of the first sip is fullfilled and the tastes collide to create a fruity, tending towards raisin, yeast infused, lightly roasted flavor.  This beer is more towards sweet, but the other flavors tone the sweetness down and add complexity.  The finish is wet with a suttle hint of fruits and a larger tasting of the bready yeast, delicious.  The silky smooth texture is similar to a plum juice without the bitter drying effects.  Hits the tongue smoothly, and caresses the taste buds.  Then slides gently down the throat.  The faint warmth it creates is a perfect complement.  The alchohol flavorings are almost non-existent and are blended in well with the overall taste.  Only thing I could ask for is a more complex flavor with a few more earthy flavors.  Overall this is an excellent example.  Definately a stock item in my beer cellar.","Watertown, Wisconsin, USA","ubamartian"

The second this hits my tongue the ridiculously high carbonation basically turns the beer into foam.  Feels like champagne in the mouth.

Tastes of caramel and friut blend with the malts and end with a a great subtle kick of hop bitterness in the aftertaste.

The aroma is a strong bouquet of fruit and sweet malts - it smells like you should eat it with a spoon. The flavour is divine, and changes as the drink warms. Raisins and dried figs feature prominently, and every now and then a hint of peach comes through. The sweet malts are present from the start, and become more dominant as time goes by, as does the fruitiness of the yeast.

Breathes coffee and a dark peasants bread, alcohol. Going down, there are pieces of gingerbread, and then real deep in the nose theres a small surprise, a sweet thing, the sprout of a cinnamon and vanilla pair, but hard to get to.
Taste is no surprise, coffee again, and dough with wood. Oily texture, less creamy than some other abts. Makes me want to eat a cookie. My girl-friend says ""Bellewaerde!"" because it reminds her of an amusement park. I try to focus on dominant flavours but the beer lacks some identity. Perhaps this is why I like it so much, it doesnt try to be anything different.

Poured deep brown and red, heavily speckled with particles of flavour, even through the off-white bountiful head.  Lots of alcohol in the aroma, paired with milk chocolate, prunes, rock candy, and sour fruit.  Aroma is busy, tons to offer.  Youll find lots of yeast and bread along with figs, prunes, plums, cloves, milk chocolate, and a hearty dose of alcohol.  These Belgians are so often well done and this is obviously no different - let it warm up, the flavours just charge out.

Best Before 7/11/11

St. Bernardus Abt 12 pours a deep murky crimson red. Glowing ruby highlights illuminate small floating particles when held to the light. A one finger airy beige head formed on the pour and slowly fell to a cap of creaminess leaving some spotty lacing on the way down. Has the look like the good, big Belgians. When you look you know its going to be packed with flavor. Murky and dark like its trying to hide its secret before they spring out on you.

Aroma is big on the dark fruits including plums, prunes, raisins, and figs. I believe theres even some bing cherries in there, not many, but there are a few. Doughy malts are all over the background. A touch of sugary sweetness and slight earthy mustiness. Very nice.

Big tongue coating amount of doughy and bready malt hit right away. not as much of the dark fruit on the tongue as in the aroma. Its there but not as distinct and comes along more mid palate and finishes things off. Figs, prunes, and raisins are the fruit present on the tongue and mix very nicely with some candy like sweetness and a touch of milk chocolate. Earthy dusty yeastiness and a very welcomed alcohol spice add to the complexities.

The mouthfeel of this beer is outstanding. It actually seems light and airy up front but becomes medium-full with a superb velvety texture. Alcohol warmth on the swallow. Great mouthfeel.

This is an easy beer to put away. Far to easy for a beer this large but it is something I could probably only drink a couple glasses of in a sitting just because of the sheer size and complexities.

An exceptional quad from an exceptional brewery. Loaded with complexities and the only alcohol present comes in as another added layer of spiciness. Only gets better and better as it warms.

The flavor of the beer is satisfying, but I dont think it is as complex as say, a Rochefort.  That doesnt have to be a drawback, though. Amidst a thick, chewy mouthfeel, I detect a fleeting, tingling of citric-peel sourness that almost instantaneously gives way to a much longer lasting sweet plum / black cherry profile before finally anchoring  to a sweet, cinnamon tinged breadiness. A certain yeast funkiness is along for the ride and also gets the last word. Well, maybe the last word belongs to the alcohol, which is 10%. Nice. Yet that may be too many words( last or otherwise)  for this beer, certainly a top notch Belgian, but is slightly overcome by its sheer sweetness and density to be totally irresistable.

2863,"2007-08-30",4.5,"Deep brown with reddish highlights. Large light brown head with classic Belgian lacing. Smells of raisins and spices and alcohol. Like the great tripels and quadrupels, this sits full and lively on the tongue. Sweet and malty, tastes of apricots and raisins. Nice warm alcohol finish. This is a world-class beer.","Erie, Colorado, USA","beerheart"
2863,"2007-08-30",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 20, 2007 330 ml bottle from Bieropholie, served almost cold in a tulip glass.
App.:  Clear deep cooper with a large tan foam.
  
Aroma:  Fruits  cherries, plums, raisins, apricots, hazelnuts, sweet candi sugar and brown sugar, soft vanilla, a hint of spice, some fresh-baked bread or cookies, a little wood and alcohol, sumptuous and inviting.
  
Palate:  Medium-full body, fairly full effervescence.
  
Flav.:  More dried dark fruits than the nose, some of the other fruits too, plenty of hazelnut, a solid dose of alcohol, somewhat sweet and leaves a bit too much alcohol on the finish, with a little lingering nuttiness.

Beautiful and big, but the alcohol is surprisingly (and disappointingly) present.  The monk on the label is probably smiling because hes three sheets to the wind...","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"
2863,"2007-08-30",4.1,"Dark color, with a lasting, foamy head.  Burst with bitey flavors.  Can be rough at first, but went down smooth after a few sips.  Drank well in a glass chalice.  Good beer to try, but like a previous posting, probably wont buy again.  But then again, im not a big brown ale fan.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","phllybeer29"

2863,"2007-08-27",4.0,"Bottle. 11.2 oz. Pours a dark opaque brown with hints of red, and a huge off white head that lasts the length of the brew. Aroma is yeasty, like dust on a windowsill with some smell of overripe fruit, light malt. Medium bodied with light almost creamy carbonation. Flavor has some dates, little plum, mostly sweet though and of caramel and malt. Strong alcohol presence, maybe too strong. Finish is fairly clean and unexpected. Very nice.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","MadMan"

Malty, decently hoppy with a dominating banana flavor. Full bodied. The finish is of lingering banana and butter. This beer leaves a nice lacing. My least favorite St. Bernardus. Additional comment: I enjoyed this beer much more the second time. Nice burnt caramel and plum components.","SWITZERLAND","Embrouille"
2863,"2007-08-26",4.7,"This was exceptional. The beer has just the right amount of fruit, spice and everything blended together. Warms you up, Id definately reccomend getting some I purchased the bottle from the Central Market in Austin.","Texas, USA","jexes23"
2863,"2007-08-25",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2012 1 pt 9.4oz bottle have been saving this one for a while. bottle poured with vigor and had a nice foamy head that diminished to a nice layer of little pools of carbination erupting to the surface all over. when held to the light there is a fair amount of sediment in the glass and the color is a nutty brown with some reddish tone. the body in the glass is thick with smells of cherry, yeasts, spices of many flavors, and an alcohol warmth. but on to the tasting part, wow hits with so many good things going on. heavy malt is apparent, cherry, plum, fig, cinnamon, and as another rater stated anise, and some tasty yeasty notes with a flowery snap. really has just the right carbination and the alcohol is well hidden. second glass is pouring just as well as the first, really pretty in the glass. so the question is does it live up to the hype? in my mind it does, looks great in the glass, smell is complex and not overpowering, and the beer itself has many great flavors that combine well. have been looking for a beer to put at the top of the pack and this fits the bill well.","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"
2863,"2007-08-25",4.6,"I bought a sixel about 2 years ago and have been milking it the entire time. Pretty much drink a glass every once in a while or when I crave a quad.  Unbelievable how much this has grown with age. Still hides the 10.5% just as good as it did 2 years ago.  So many flavors /aromas it would be hard to write them all here. Id say the raisin is coming in stronger now than it used to.  Still complex and wonderful. The sixel was well worth the 2nd mortgage.","Silver Spring, Pennsylvania, USA","Miver"
2863,"2007-08-25",4.7,"Unbelievable beer.  Very complex flavor.  I had trouble isolating particular flavors, but it was amazing.  Spicy and mildly fruity, Id say.  I couldnt believe how smooth this beer was for 10.5% alcohol.  Ive had MUCH more offensive beers at 8%.  This was spectacular!!!","Ohio, USA","ardrum"
2863,"2007-08-22",4.0,"Aroma of dark fruits backed by roasted caramel malt. Deep ruby tinged dark amber color with a beige head that quickly flattened. Medium bodied; moderate, nearly creamy, carbonation. The flavor is prune, molasses, raisin, brown sugar, wheat?, caramel malt. Smoothly fruity, sort of. The finish is sweet around the edges, with some bitter at the back of the mouth. It is to die for. Fortunately, only the bank account has to pass over. Got to get more.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
2863,"2007-08-20",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 29, 2007 750 ml bottle.  One of the better beers Ive ever had,  It had a remarkable head and color that was a deep opaque brown.  The armoa and flavor were also very distinct and sweet malty flavor.  The palate was exceptional and the 10.5% ABV was hardly noticeable.    I dont understand why people would buy a cheap wine when they can have this instead.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","Hammster"
2863,"2007-08-19",4.2,"Draft @BSP.  Neverending head with similar lacing, nose of dark plums, other yeasty fruit, with a rich palate of plum, iron, molasses, slight malt sweetness and delicious yeast character with only a slight tinge of hop bitterness in the lingering finish.  A classic, undoubtedly.","USA","ElGaucho56"

2863,"2007-08-14",4.2,"Bottle, thanks Mike! Deep brown with big tan head. Nose of toasty malt, brown sugar, raisin, fruit, cinnamon, yeast, and something vaguely salty like peanuts. Flavor is incredibly smooth, balancing sweet, toasty, and peppery notes, with a wonderful peppery and yeasty finish. The alcohol is well masked while providing a bit of warmth throughout. This was pretty tasty stuff.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","walter"
2863,"2007-08-13",4.7,"The large bottles of this fine treat recently appeared at one of the local shops and I found it fitting to get one as a gift to myself for my 31st birthday. Popped the cork and slowly poured my first glassful into a nice big wine glass. Sturdy dark brown color with some amber highlights. An immensely thick billowing head that provided plenty of dense fluffy lacing. One of THE most enjoyable aromas Ive ever been around, I sniffed on this for what seemed like ages. Layers of dark rich sugary malt and earthy yeast. Lots of black licorice and fermented cherries. Nice spiciness, reminded me of nutmeg, anise, and even some light caraway seed. Beautiful aroma, top notch for sure. Medium body, extremely smooth with an incredibly easiness to it. A touch of alcohol harshness attacks the palate, and it soon mellows as a nice effect on the palate. Sweet and filling, this is a fantastic sipper. So tasty and good! Loads of sweet bready malt, sugary and smooth with some rich caramel. I could even pick up hints of roasted malt and some fine chocolate. Cherry syrup, fermented figs, anise and black licorice. Mild alcohol presence backed by peppery spices. Great yeasty earthiness. Intensely complex yet straightforward the flavor is very assertive. Fantastic Belgian, absolutely first class. A wonderful gift to myself,","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"
2863,"2007-08-12",4.3,"Draft -  Poured a very cloudy brown in color with a big creamy light tan head.  Aroma was strong of the classic Belgian yeastiness, some alcohol, sweet malt and vanilla.  Palate was thick and creamy.  Flavor was somewhat sweet with malts and bready with yeast.  The finish was thick and chewy with a slightly sourness right at the end.  This was really an awesome beer which I truly enjoyed.  I will seek out another opportunity ASAP!","Seymour, Tennessee, USA","VTHopHead"
2863,"2007-08-11",4.8,"I expected to be underwhelmed by this...and I was NOT. It really is fantastic. Poured dark murky brown with huge head that lasted throughout with lacing ALL over the glass. Spicy alcohol aroma made me think that the strong alcohol would be all over the taste. It wasnt. Its almost hard to believe a 10% abv beer could taste so smooth. Sweet fruity taste, but not overly so...could hardly even taste the alcohol. Amazing. Not as complex as I thought it would be from reading reviews...but was just delicious nonetheless. Perfect carbonation. Really, really good. I wish I could buy this by the case and still afford to pay my mortgage.","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"
2863,"2007-08-08",4.2,"Big bottle as shown. Pours a dark amber color with a large light tan head. The aroma is a strong malty aroma with hints of hazlenut and vanilla. Very good lacing on this one. The taste is very sweet malt with vanilla and cream, hides the alcohol well. A special beer for my 100th rating.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
2863,"2007-08-07",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2013 Pours a dark, clear, crimson-orange cola, with a finger-or-two of quickly dissipating, butter-colored head, of which leaves light lacing. Smell is heavy of fresh pizza dough, along with dark fruits, sugary fig, and some banana. Taste starts with rich caramel and buttery popcorn, then transitions into date, fig, and light spice. Finish is lightly fruity, and lightly bitter. Body is medium, with slightly chewy palate.","Rhode Island, USA","RedCloud"
2863,"2007-08-07",4.0,"Horizontal tasting with westy 12 and rochefort 10- never opens up the way the others do. Not as complex at all, but arguably the most drinkable and refreshing of the three. A real wine like characteristic (grapes, dryness), dominates throughout even as it warms. Go with the Rochefort instead.","Williamsville, New York, USA","hopson"
2863,"2007-08-06",3.1,"12 oz bottle proved from Secret Santa 2006/2007.  Pours mahogany and hazy with a solid white head.  A bit chunky.  The aroma has alcohol, Belgian candy, ginger bread and dark fruit.  The flavor is fairly complex but nother that does it for me.  I get dates or fig or something, Belgian candy, burnt caramel or fruit or some such thing.  Theres some noticeable alcohol too.  All and all this thing is an overpowering mess of flavors that I do not find enjoyable.  I cant believe I like the special addition so much better than this but I did.  Not a big fan of this one.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"
2863,"2007-08-04",4.0,"33c cL bottle. Pours deep brown with small sediments floating around. Off-white creamy head. Aroma of dried fruit, slight caramel and roasted notes.

Much less enjoyable than the fist experience. more than I can appreciate and on the strong side. First sample:On tap at Vintage Estates Wine and Beer, thanks Ron.  Cloudy root beer appearance with a rapidly fading head. Slight aroma of sweetness, barely any. Initial taste is very smooth, it really hides the alky content well. It leaves me thinking about how refined these Belgies are compared to many of the unrefined wanna be american craft brews. Surprisingly enjoyable for such a high alky %. Bready and flavorful. A decent brew for a sweet beer lover. Smooth creamy low level carbonation. Very civilized and easy to enjoy.  Impressive for a style that I dont care much about.  A little more enjoyable than 	Ommegang Three Philosophers.

2863,"2007-07-20",4.3,"Having been schooled by monks (monks that confiscated my beer from my dorm room), I feel a special connection with this beer.  For it was the Benedictine Brothers that drove me to drink beer in the first place.  The socially-deprived, spirit-smothering environment was just what pushed me into the arms of Pheiffer and Cold Spring beers.  Now this many years later, I enjoy the finest Quad I have had.  It is rich and luxurious - a stark contrast to the monk-infested cement quarters I used to live in.  A truly great beer.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","mistersinalin"
2863,"2007-07-20",4.2,"Lighter brown than other Belgian Quadrupels, I was expecting a lighter flavor than other beers from around Watou. Boy, I was wrong! It poured with an average-sized head for this beer type -- about a finger or two... Tannish, natural leather-colored head and significant lacing. The smell was yeasty, with toffee, taffy and caramel rounding it out. The taste was similar, only with light chocolate, coffee with some malt and sugary fruit. Thick, leathery mouthfeel and a sweet finish. Overall, a very nice beer -- I understand why this beer gets such high honors here. Of all the top beers that I have tasted, this is my ""go-to"" beer.

I was very nervous about trying this....high alcohol content, dark brown, yada yada yaada.  Well, try it I did.  It poured a dark brown into the glass with a small head that lasted throughout the entire beer.  The aroma was thick with bread and hops, and some fruit.  It was silky smooth on the tongue with a full-bodied feel.  The taste.........unlike any beer Ive tasted before.  There was bread, and malt...and hops.

The taste has a beautiful smooth malt profile, a bit chocolatey, that merges perfectly with the warming alcohol finish... dark fruit, prunes dipped  in alcohol, somewhat spicey, herbal,  nutty, dry...

2863,"2007-07-09",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2007 Dark mahogany pour with reclusive ruby hues, very obviously bottle conditioned. A big off-white head forms, fading very slowly, never fully. Thick lacing clings to the glass the whole way down as the liquid is drained away. The aroma is very earthy and upon first nosing, its plain to see where this beers origins lie. Notes of wood grain, classic Belgian yeast, spices, soft hops, raisins, figs, dates, plums, lightly roasted malts, bitter chocolates, carob, apples and other mellow fruit scents. Very complex and always engaging. Caramel seems to compose an intricate backbone, structured in a way as to provide steady sweetness that doesnt interfere with the enjoyable process of dissecting subtle nuances. Alcohol is noticeable but never bothersome, though the flavor would score one point higher were it less noticeable. The flavor is a dynamic mosaic of fruits, yeast spiciness, chcocolates and roast. Candi sugar sweetness parades around the woody notes and seems to seep into the furthest recesses of the mouth. The sweetness level is medium-high, bitterness is mild, acidity low to mild. Carbonation throughout is medium-high and soft. Prickly spicing is a fine counterpart to sticky caramel notes. The finish is very sweet initially, then dries signifigantly and leaves fruit and sugar notes alone to battle for supremacy until the next sip. A very elegant palate, a sort of modest full body with plenty of excitement for all the senses. Light vinous and alcohol notes throughout. Very good. Although this doesnt share the complexity of some notable Abt beers, it stands strong and deserves regognition for consistency, great aroma and taste and a lively spirit. Seems serene and reserved while still knocking over the tastebuds like a wrecking ball of sweet flavors.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Update :: recently tasted this on tap at the Brick Store Pub and was blown away at the difference in tap vs. bottle.  Out of the tap it is much creamier and a bit mellowed out.  Absolutely excellent.  Out of the bottle it is more alive with flavor and carbonation on the palate.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","craftbeerdesign"
2863,"2007-06-27",4.6,"A surprisingly refreshing and excellent tasting beer. It has a very rich creamy texture and maintains a foamy top until the glass is empty. It is strong and yet sweet. The mildly bitter herbs are soothed by a deep caramel flavor. There is a light fruit and nut taste mixed in to round it off. The first impression is wow! It only gets better from there. The flavor further builds and evolves. It lingers for a pleasurably long long time. A great nightcap to bring sweet dreams to anyone who appreciates a superior trappist.","Den Haag, NETHERLANDS","rjglory"

The taste is slightly alcoholic with pine, nuts, figs, yeast, malt, berry, and pretty much every other flavor imagineable.  Truly a ride with a long aftertase .

The initial aroma was a bit musty and horsey but quickly faded to a fruit medley of  apples, grapes, prunes and pears. The fruit cake notes that many detect in this beer are present, but I felt the overall aroma was ""lighter"" than that descriptor. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, creamy, sticky-sweet and lightly effervescent with a hint of alcohol at the end. Pears, apples and plums front a warm alcohol finish.

Rather tame aromas of anise, bubblegum, and faint spice. Flavor echos the nose- more spice with some cherry, metallic, and herbal notes. A combination of hoisin sauce and pomegranate juice comes to mind. Very short on fruit. Flash-bang fizzy palate. Dry, tingly finish. As the beer warms and carbonation subsides, flavors skew even more toward peppery and licoricey. The muddy bitterness of unsweetened chocolate competes with an alcoholic burn in the aftertaste.

2863,"2007-05-02",4.5,"First bottle consumed at the Académie de la Bière here in Paris, which Ill review as well to help any fellow ex-pats looking for quality beer and eatins here in Paris.
As for the substance itself... confronted with a powerfully large beverage menu with some fairly incredible inebriantations to select from, I opted for this stalwart intoxicant.. in small part because I had heard satisfactory things, in greater part because the wry old smiley man on the vessel itself looks as if hes an elderly pederast, attempting to entice an innocent wide eyed little boy into his parlor.. and this makes me giggle (with alarm!).
If i were that little boy, I may well have skipped (or sauntered, depending on a variety of factors) right into that parlor, provided he handed me this beer first. Extremely complex and yet indefatigably smooth, deep and dark, almost like a river containing deep and dark liquid, if this river were made of beer resembling St. Bernardus Abt 12. A slight sour/bitter bite at the end, yet there is a sweet aftertaste as well, combined with a hint of roasty and toasty - ness.. so the aftertaste ends up being simultaneously bitter and sweet, and it seems to work advantageously. The ABV % was extremely well incorporated.
Most importantly, however, was the domineering nature of the ghosty quality of this beer.. a trait so rare that I cant even begin to describe it. Ive tried, on numerous occasions.. though language itself has proved woefully inadequate for the task. I have developed a hand signal that, in part, helps paint a mental picture of the quality of Ghostiness.. and I will leave you with this, which you will keep between yourself and myself and NOT DIVULGE, for any reason or price, even if your life is threatened.. by reading the previous sentence, you are now bound to this agreement.

This beer really stood out as the best St. Bernardus offering. I recently did a blind taste test along with Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren 12, and St. Bernardus 12 didnt really stand up. Definitely a great beer, but didnt quite reach the sublime level of the other two. The beer pours with a nice red-brown colour with white head.

The head on the beer was very frothy with large bubbles that stuck to the edge of the glass for a good deal of time.  I smelled raisins and malt.  The taste was of the classic Abt/Quad style.  The taste is dried fruit, carmel with carbonation and alcohol.  The mouthfeel is tremendous as the beer really coats your whole mouth and warms you up as it goes down.  The beer got better with each sip, as I think it was a little to cold on the first few sips.  This is a tremendous beer and is in my top five beers of all time.  I have a bottle of the special edition aging in the basement.  I am extremely excited to try that one next.","New Jersey, USA","RiverHorse"
2863,"2007-03-31",3.1,"11.2 oz. bottle. Sweet, classic Belgian aroma. Cinnamon and sugar scents. The smell is disappointingly weak. Pours a sparkling brown with a large amount of suspended particulate and a large amount of beige head. Produces limited lacing. Sweetness and alcohol dominate the flavor, which is similar to that of a barleywine. Thats unfortunate, as I am not a big fan of the barleywine style. Chocolatey. Bitter, English-style hops noticeable. Lacks the complexity and spicyness that make so many Belgian beers special. Bland. Little aftertaste. Full-bodied. Smooth and lively in the palate; very good texture. Easy to drink, which is impressive for a beer with such a high alcohol content. Light alcohol burn. I found St. Bernardus Abt 12 to be remarkably disappointing. I had heard great things about this beer, and it completely failed to live up to the hype. Sure, its drinkable, but its just boring.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Lots of yeast characteristics to this beers aroma as well as some candied sugar and fruits.

Headily orange-fruity snout with boozy suggestions of port and licorice. Caramel-smooth maltiness with a hint of medicinal woody spice and a generous slug of licorice-yeasty bitterness in the finish.  (Re-rate) Aroma distinctly oaky, soapy, sweet but hopped. Garden herb/ noble hints in there. Would never have picked that up before I went to Munich. Almost pitch and creamily collared. BLOOD, liquorice, soap and sugar in the mouth with a nibble of roasted barley. Herbally hops apparent. Smoke and alcohol aftertaste. Its a decent enough big dark Belgian ale no doubt, but excessively sugared and too boozy for my liking, and lacks the elegance and complexity of its Trappist brothers. Digging those delicate noble hop notes, however.(8/4/7/4/15) (Re-rate) Wildly incongruous waft of noble hops- herbal, unfiltered helles germanic, chick pea. Singular, pure, uncomplicated, un-’Quad’- like. Apparently v.dark ruby tints. Liquorice black but copper vs lightbulb. Immovable narrow cappccino collar like a floating layer of cream. Herbal Hop-driven without bitterness. Chick pea, kidney bean notes merging into soft whispering booze, sweet peppery coriander-like spice never tasted in a beer this dark and big. Drifting towards the numbing caramel silk of Chimay. Saved by those hops, but standard liquorice finish.. mixed bean salad dowsed in marzipan/palinka alcohol.

As it moves down the pipes, I feel a warming sensation that is no doubt caused by the 10.5% alcohol. The alcohol is masked in the flavor, but not hidden.

Color is a dark amber with a thick one-finger, lumpy tan head that diminishes slowly then constantly replenishes itself.   Intense initial aroma of caramel, malts with a subtle fruitiness that quickly disperses.  Each swallow results in a thick and foamy mouthfeel that has to be chewed through only to find a delicious coating on the tongue.  The flavor is  rich, malty and well blended, with a balanced, elegantly bitter finish.  A slight warming is evident from the alcohol, which is otherwise hidden.  Strong lacing left on the glass.  Im not picking up the broader set of flavors described - could just be me.  Bumping up appearance 1 point - a full glass and a single pour makes all the difference.

Paper notes from the Falls Tasting / 2006 YeHA!.  Sampled next to the Westy 8 and 12.  Minimal head.  Clear maple color.  Sweet malty start, balanced malt-bitterness in the body.  Finish is creamily succulent, and lightly bitter.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Sombeast"

Re-Rate, Vintage July 2002 bottle, batch 467:  
Found two of these bottles at a local bottle shop for $3.50! Dark brown color with very small off-white head and no lacing. Extreme caramel flavor, taste like candy. Light fruit and slightly sweet. A little woody and roasty. Its like a good strong cigar. Cant taste the alcohol at all but still has a warm feeling. Aroma is all malty caramel. This is like nothing Ive ever had before and truly unique from a fresh bottle.","Ohio, USA","b33r"

2863,"2006-12-20",4.0,"Presents a gorgeous nutty deep brown color with an off white head that wants to stick around. 
Aroma  fresh hops, licorice, honey, charred caramel, oak. 
The 10% ABV is brilliantly masked. Along with the bursting malts you get a sweet sensation that lingers far beyond finishing your drink. However answering the big question as to how this compares to its Trappist (Quadrupel) cousins - well its different, quite different. When compared to the Rocheford 10, while the Trappist ale is warm and highly complex, the St. Bernardus is an easy drink and not as overwhelming. Im in no way suggesting that this is a better brew than the Rocheford 10, well come to think about its probably not, however there is still much to appreciate here when judged on its on accord.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","StateofTrance"

Sweet flavors stand out first, with some brown sugar, honey, caramel, milk chocolate, grapes, and plums.  Fades to vanilla as I swirl and swallow.  Finishes surprisingly dry for such sweetness, and the light hops make their presence known quite wonderfully.  The yeast continues to dry things out, but then my mouth tastes like choclate.  Hmm!

2863,"2006-12-12",4.8,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2011 Dec. 12, 2006; 12 oz. bottle sampled this past weekend at Farm 255, Athens GA.  Not being a particular fan of the style, I didnt expect to swoon over this.  However, served in a Trappist glass, I must admit that this fascinatingly complex concoction of dark fruit and malty flavors is one of the best brews Ive yet tried.  The 10.5% ABV is remarkably well-hidden. Just need to find a place to obtain it in Central New York State!   Addl comments on Jan. 8, 2007: Even better with the opportunity to sit down and really examine & savor this.  Detecting more alcohol this time around (with a fresh palate!); very cidery in appearance when viewed under a strong light.  Flavor is so complex . . . exquisite, really. So sorry this isnt the ""big"" bottle!

Addl comment June 1, 2008: Had the opportunity to ""A-B"" this with Rochefort 10 today and, as much as I LOVE the more lively St. Bernardus, the Rochefort edges it in both the flavor & palate categories.

Re-rate on Jan. 3, 2011: I find no flaw in this beer -- and, after having compared it once again with the boozier Rochefort 10 over the holidays, have upgraded it to the top of my all-time list.  This could be a ""5"", but Im leaving the door slightly ajar in the taste & overall categories, in the unlikely event I encounter something more enjoyable than this heavenly brew.","Waterville, New York, USA","MarkBarnes"

2863,"2006-12-09",3.9,"A 33cl bottle served from a fridge at the Bishops Arms in Umeå.
Drinking this beer has really driven home to me the impact of beer temparature on taste. I thought this bottle was too cold to start with. The head came up very thin and flat (having read that the head on this beer was normally quite impressive). Aroma was initially quite faint, but as the beer warmed it released a powerful nose of spirit-soaked plums, figs, blackberries and salty liquorice.
Its not the most attractive beer in the world - a murky, muddy brown. Its the palate that lifts this beer - soft and light. Nothing sticks out and everything fits. Theres no huge yeast character but more malt than most quads Ive tried. 
The beauty of the 12 lies in its ability to hide its 10.5% of alcohol so cleverly youd never know it was there.  In this respect its the best Ive so far tasted.
But is it one of the best? On this occcasion Id have to say no. By the end of the glass, as it warmed gently in my hands, it was beginning to stir, as though it had something else to tell me but wed both run out of time.
So some another time it will be. At home where I can enjoy it at the right temperature and maybe unlock the full greatness of this beer.","Umeå, SWEDEN","lagomswedish"

Very inviting and complex aroma of plum, raisin, dark cherry, bread, yeast, vanilla and on and on; it takes time to ponder the different unique aromas you can pick out as it breathes and warms.  Taste follows suit every bit as much as aroma, along with mild alcohol warmth; after all that its surprisingly smooth with a clean finish.  Hard to believe there is so much complexity you can separately pick out yet it blends and holds together in a near perfect way.

But this should not come as a surprise when you know that this is the same brewer that produced, under license,  the ""West Vleteren"" beers from the end of WW2 to 1992. The production of this beer is still based on the same knowhow and ingredients. When someone tells us there are differences with the ""Westvleteren"" then he is however wright as there will allways be small differences between different batches. Those differences exists between different batches of the ""Westvleteren 12°"" too. There are however 3 great dissimilarities: availability, hype and price.

Taste-wise, this beer is supremely balanced.  Sweet malts and stone fruits hit up front but are kept in checked by a subdued hoppy bitterness.  Spice and yeast detectable but not necessarily the focal points here.  Aftertaste is lasting and sweet.

Bottle split with Tronraner and Muenster in a  blind tasting among Allagash Four, Rochefort 10, and St. Bernardus 12.  Im very glad I revisited this one with a more analytical approach. I found this one to be the most similar to Westvleterns quad in the tasting, though it didnt quite match the intricate nuances of that offering. It does have a similar dry finish and bountiful complexity of its own. Joe selected this one over the Rochefort 10 in the blind and I couldnt really argue with him. At this level of fine beer craftsmanship, it comes down to personal taste. St. Bernardus 12 has more tartness and floral character along with the notes of cloves, bubblegum, banana, earth, faint citrus, cinnamon, tobacco. This beer is the least expensive and most available out of the three in our tasting, but it can go toe to toe with any other beer in the style.

Tap into a plastic cup consumed on the streets of Savannah. This is a really nice looking beer, even in its quaint disposable vessel. It’s almost black with a very well formed and tall whitish head. The aroma sports heavy esters with a load of dark fruit and spices. A small sourness and dry spiced flavor hits the palate first then mellows out with sweeter, fruitier character. The alcohol is very well hidden. This is one of the finer examples of the style.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Thick and and mouthfilling in an amazing way.  This is a beer I could imagine fasting on.  The flavors are as robust as the aroma.  Big round chocolatey malt over big alcohol and Belgian fruity sourness.  Theres also some creaminess and a bit of almost american tasting floral hops.  Also, a very minerally feel from this like a dry riesling.  The lingering bitterness screams Belgium and alcohol.

A wonderful yeasty bread aroma is immedately evident, but some time and concentration results in additional subtle notes of dark fruit, and a little fragrant spiciness. Full mouthfeel with a lively effervescece, very easy to drink for a beer with this much complexity. Alcohol is not evidnet, and the flavor is malt biased with dark fruit, brown sugar, and a lgith sourness that leads to a faint bitterness to round out the malt.

Nose is sweet malt and powerful sweet fruit.  Also, yeast and a little wheat.  Taste predominately complex and sweet maltiness with fruit (apple, raisin, orange, and something a bit more exotic) and alcohol.  Spicy with caramel.  Thinner than Id expect for something with 10%.  Soft.  A good beer, possibly great, but Im not sure it deserves all the fuss. [3.8]Long-awaited re-rate, here in the US on 11 September 2008, with a best before date of Christmas Day 2012.  Explosive nose is yeasty fig, caramel malt with richly spiced fruit cake, raisin and berry.  A touch of green apple under orange rind and Smarties dust.  Opaque chestnut pour that leans toward the black, with a lush, yeast-driven head (sort of a Duvel Dark, though toned down a bit).

The flavor is nothing like the aroma. Wonderfull mouselike malty silkyness on the toungue that feels almost erotic. Starts sweet and fruity (rasberries, cherries, raisins) then theres a second or two of bitternes and a finish of oak and smoked maple leaving an aftertaste of coffee and nuts.

2863,"2006-06-02",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2007 An absolutely enjoyable experience. St. Bernies poured a wonderful dark brown color with an enormous head that was well sustained. The lacing and rings of foam left behind (still there when all was gone) was great. The mouthfeel was fuller but not richer than what I remembered for the Roche 10 (and the sedimentation much less). Was nicely carbonated. The aroma was spicey and full of dark fruits. Flavor was plum like and candy-sugared with great spicing and a noticeable, but pleasant touch of alcohol. At almost half the price of Roche 10, this will be my ""treat"" beer in the future - monks or no monks. Re-rate, 2/07, dropping a few nothces, not as rich in the dark fruit area as I once thought, yeasty spice was the distinguishing feature of this one. At the same 2/07 re-reate, a 1.5yr aged version was a bit too much caramel-like with some teabag flavors, lacking the dark fruit complexity, lacking the spiciness, and lacking the yeastiness. I cant hold a position that this thing aged better than it was fresh, thats for sure. No points knocked off my numbers for the aged bottle, but it dropped a few notches here and there based on the retaste. Re-rate, 7/07 in a horizontal alongside Westv 12 and Roche 10, this was right in the middle of both, Roche 10 #1. Appearance solid with a nice frothy head, great retention and lacing. The aroma had some floral notes, faint dark fruits, caramel, grapes, light plums, light cocoa with a bitter bready yeasty finish, some coriander spices also zinging there. Mouthfeel was full with dry bitterness and spicey zing, alcohol well blended into the picture. My second favorite behind Roche 10.","","User37895"

2863,"2006-06-01",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2006 One of the best Belgian Quads you can get your hands on. Pours a deep mahogony-brownish color with a very impressive head, pour this one carefully. Very complex and full bodied, dark fruits round this beer out very nicely. Brown sugar definitely present along with other complex fruity flavors such as faint esters. HUGE rocky head that will stick around for the entire drink. This is definitely one of my favorite Belgians, but I do find that the beers vary from batch to batch. I have had some that were so-so in both flavor and appearance (such as head retention) and i have had others that were just out of this world! I am reviewing based on the better batches, which is what you will usually get. This beer definitely gets better with each sip. I like to carefully pour the beer into my glass until I get to the last couple ounces. Then I swirl it and pour the remaining couple ounces into an empty glass and enjoy! It gives it a very tasty nutty characteristic that I just cant get enough of. I HIGHLY recommend this amazing beer.","Wheat Ridge, Colorado, USA","MrEcted1"

The aroma is sweet dark fruits, fusel alcohol and some bitterness.  It becomes a bit more pleasant as it warms.

The flavor is some sweet and sugary dark fruit with a lot of belly-warming strong alcohol.  As it warms, more fruitiness and a slightly bitter, bready yeastiness comes out to balance the alcohol.  The mouthfeel is medium with some harsh carbonation.

Overall,  a bit of a disappointment.  I let this sit for about 15-20 minutes before starting, but it was still a bit harsh at the beginning.  As it warmed, it became much better.

2863,"2006-05-17",4.9,"Once I popped the cork out, I let this set out to warm.  Then I poured and notice an attactive head which pretty much filled my snifter over a hazy dark red body with a small amount of particalia present.  I spent about 10 minutes sniffing at this beer and eagerly awaited for the slowly diminishing head to calm down.  But I didnt mind smelling this, as I discovered a plethera of flavors: toffee, apple, cherry, vanilla, brown sugar, and spices.  By this time the temperature of the beer was starting to warm up, and believe me, this is a beer in which you dont want to taste too cold, because by the end of finishing this full 25 ouncer, it was just incredible.  The only very tiny flaw I could see is that the beer was a bit chalky on the palate.  But all of the other qualities of this concoction made up for it.  This is one world class brew!

The body has an opaque, dark brown with rust highlights and noticable effervesence; light tan, mostly full, frothy head persists to the end and leaves nice tight Belgian lace.  Finally the nose is excellent with molasses, caramel, fig, light banana, cherry, and apple, maybe some cinnamon and nutmeg, maple underneath and light earth, and faint pecans; very interesting and inviting.  The taste never quite matches the nose; sweet caramel, molasses, and fig dominate, but never allowing it to get cloyingly sweet.  Slight banana, pecans, dates, and spice (cinnamon and nutmeg) back the big malt flavors with a slight acidity that melds into the finish.  Very full bodied, thick, chewy, and lively makes up the palate.  Finishes long and fairly sweet with only a tinge of earthy bitterness underneath molasses, dates, and yeast esters lingering.

It pours like most any Belgian, medium-brown, slightly opaque, with a large but short-lived frothy head.  The aroma is quite sweet and gets sweeter as it warms, somewhat like malt and caramel.  The taste is initially just like that but quickly turns (for me at least) fizzy and bitter, like  weak quinine mixed with the really dark brown dried figs, the kind I dont care for much.  It finishes with a rush of alcohol, and other than the warmth from that, not a whole lot else.  I like the smell, the first sweet taste, but I miss the other things I find in Belgians.

Finish has lots of the aspects of the initial taste mixed with spiciness and lots of carbonation.  Throughout the glass the flavors are often muffled out by the sharp carbonation.

2863,"2006-03-26",4.3,"This beer smells like a meal, and delivers with an engaging flavor and sexy mouthfeel. Beer pours a clear, very dark copper-brown color with plenty of little yeasty seamonkeys living happily in suspension. The head is large, off-white, frothy, mostly lasting and quite lacy. The aroma is unlike anything Ive ever smelled in a beer before: Moderately malty with sweet notes of roasted grain, cookie and light-to-moderate notes of savory toasted bread; Heavily yeasty with unique notes of tangy bread dough, damp basement and sharp cheese; Miscellaneous aromas include a light note of alcohol (not heavy enough to betray the ABV, though), heavy notes of raisin/date and sherry. The flavor is heavily sweet and lightly bitter with a long, tummy-warming, moderately bitter, lightly bittersweet finish. The body is full, the texture is velvety and the carbonation is soft.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","luckygirl"

Initial sweetness (dates, raisin, faint plum) rapidly gives way to very spicy flavors (cinnamon, cardamom, white pepper).  Flavor would be higher rated if I could get over the intenseness of the alcohol, which toward the end is almost artificially strong.  Ends with bitter chocolate.  Chunky mouthfeel.

Lots of yeast, corriander, dark fruits, malty sweetness, and a little bit of alcohol blend in the nose. The flavor is nearly perfectly balanced: lots of yeast and raw grain at first, then a pleasant vinous quality with plums, unsweet grapes, and spices (corriander, a little clove, rose petal). The finish goes back to yeast, with mild banana and earth notes, and finally a hint of some bitter hops to bring things full circle. There is some alcohol warmth throughout; how could there not be at 10.5%abv? This is a superb brew. The mouthfeel is sharp from the carbonation, and some carbonic acidity comes through, as well.

The aromas is fruity esters, alcohal soaked dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar, very complex and literally makes you salivate. The taste is so complex, it starts dry and tangy with a slight vinos presence but more actually to rum or brandy.

2863,"2006-01-19",2.1,"There have been a number of comments on this site about the quality of this beer and how it is stiff competition to the esteemed Westvleteren. The old padre on the label seems to be happy that he has one in his hand and even gives some indication what the high alcohol content does to your genitalia with the other. Well I would take this gesture to be how far it goes to challenging the big W. It looks fine in the glass and presents as expected, so far the comparison is clear. The nose is incredibly dull and boring however, not a hint of the dried fruit explosion nor deep rich promise of something special to come. The first taste is as disappointing, clearly alcoholic in mouthfeel and on the palate, but there is a real lack of complexity that is anticipated. Raisin and dried fruit notes are there but these are also joined by an unpleasant medicinal undertone. Combined with a high level of carbonation and a lack of balance that does not counter the high ABV I feel a bit cheated. Shame on you father.","Potts Point, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA","Sully"

The appearance is nice - brownish, chocolate with some amber tones and a big , rocky head. Flavor is only moderately complex and much of what could be a better beer is overpowered by poor balance with the high, astringent alcohol levels.

I think the draft verion, which I had two night ago has more cherry.  There was a rocky head, but definitely not as much as on draft.  Not a whole lot of head, but it doesnt fully diminish.  Initial flavor is moderately sweet that lessens somewhat.  More cherry and bread than the aroma indicated.  The finish is long.  This was lively on th etongue, more so than the draft version.

2863,"2005-12-14",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 16, 2007 We can summarize all desire as the root of satiety.  Contentment, as an emotional statement without want, is for many the loftiest achievement; the end of a life marked with hardship and rigorous training.  To reach what is called nirvana in some cultures, an individual must caste off desire for material goods, and even more challenging, shun any pursuit of personal improvement.  They must accept the status quo, whether that means relegation or celebration.  To many, including myself, one of the greatest end-of-the-day pleasures is to fall back into a comfortable chair, accept my place in mediocrity and acknowledge that, while I may not be special to everyone, Im special to someone.  Look at that jolly face on the St. Bernardus label.  Now there is a fellow satisfied with a monkish lifestyle.  Somewhat rotund, he smiles nonetheless, incapable of remorse or regret, tonsured, frocked and pleased.  And like him, the beer itself knows that it probably isnt number one.  It may not even be number two.  But the St. Bernardus Abt. 12 occupies a special place in the hearts of quite a few secret (and published admirers).  And whats not to admire?  The full and plump color resembles wet ship wood; a lingering sight and smell that suggests exploration without guarantee of success.  The smell is like a fragrant stained glass mosaic, built from many varied parts to constitute a whole scene.  Let the wafting aroma of wet sliced pears, wine, sparkling grape juice, sour apples and some earthy vegetables tickle your nose, then dip into the succulent brew.  The smell is illusory compared to the taste, where the eager imbiber discovers a dryer, saltier melody.  Soy sauce, gourmet toast, hops, dry red wine, plums and even a crushed almond aftertaste play tricks on your tongue, inviting the lucky drinker to another sip.  The St. Bernardus no doubt looks up to its cousins of a more regal blood (Orval, Westmalle etc. etc.) and perhaps feels a tinge of inferiority.  But theres no need to feel poorly when, despite a silver-medal sentiment, the beer is all too happy to settle for itself and the devotees it courts.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

33cl bottle from Selfridges. Wow! How have I missed rating one of my top brews of all time? I guess I just always presumed it was rated already. This is nothing short of awesome. The aroma is pretty much as good as anything I have had. Creamy malts, caramel, banana and bags of vanilla. Some raisin and bread and some other fruits in there too. Mellow but absolutely gorgeous. Appearance is nothing short of perfection. On the brown side of mahogany, almost opaque and with a very long lasting tan coloured head. Great lacing too. As you tip the glass it leaves behind a solid covering. Flavour is equally excellent. Candy sugar, banana bread and vanilla with lashings of alcohol that may understandably be too much for some. Sweet, rich and complex but wonderfully smooth and silky. Yum yum yum f**king yum!!! Amazing length but the alcohol shows maybe just a tad too much at the finish. But hey come on it is a 10.5% beer. Chunky, complex and simply wonderful.   I have drained my glass in the time it took me to write this. Gutted it has gone.

The taste is odd, thin & almost unpleasnt, or unexpected... 1 of the 2. Livily carbonation.  Very malty and high in esters.

2863,"2005-10-08",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2006 The Westvleteren brethren is truly evident in this one, in fact Id put myself out to say they should share equal fame for the best ales available. This was a superb beer, and for me a far greater moment for quiet contemplation and easily one of the few wonders of the modern world. Tasted from the bottle and poured into a chalice around room temperature. Deepest garnet-ruby brown with a dense 1"" rocky beige head. Head would not budge for the length and left an abundance of lace that webbed down the glass. Intense and robust, concentrated fruit nose; plums and earthy-vineyard wine grapes, toffee, caramel and ground spices, lightly peppery with a hint of forest floor hops. Strong and yet oddly delicate in the mouth, big in body and wonderfully smooth like a vintage port. Flavour shifted away from the enticing aroma to reveal cocoa, Belgian chocolate and a lot of malt. Very soft in carbonation, only heightened by the peppery alcohol that otherwise remained well-hidden. Plums and drying Merlot-like grapes came in just prior to a smooth, dry and warming malty and wine-like swallow. The hops remained inert, so immaculately integrated only a light earthy note was evident that they were added at all. It gets hard with all Belgian ales as they are so unique and I suppose this was as close to heaven as I would ever get. One was enough, in fact I feel good that one was all I needed. Perfect!!! (33cL, 18 months old, BBE 12/01/09, Intl Beer Shop) Re-rate:- Looks fantastic in the glass. Big, big rocky and dense, beige head that lasts. Intricate lacing follows it down. Body on this one is almost black, ruby shined through in the lights. Extremely spicy, herbal nose with a fungal yeasty note (mushrooms? [alarm bells are ringing!]) that doesnt sit right atop layers of complex malts. Frothy in the mouth and the alcohol is now more pronounced than the 18 month old (aged a lot in six months).  All other notes are the same, so it remains a super brew. Lovely after 18 months and two years so a fresh one would be nice. Sadly a couple of points lost for aroma, mouthfeel and overall. Still remarkably good. ( 33cL, 12/01/09)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"
2863,"2005-10-07",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 8, 2005 11.2 oz bottle - It pours a very dark brown with paricles swirling around and settling on the bottom of the glass. The tan head is foamy and creamy, about 2"" in a Duvel Glass. It last forever, althought is shrinks to about 1/2"" rather quickly.  Aroma is of malt, yeast, rasin and caramel. Flavors are complex and semi-sweet with a distinctly chocolate dominance. There is also rasin and caramel and hints of other fruits. Mouthfeel is rich, full and creamy. The 10% alcohol is barely noticeable. This is unquestionably a work of art, although its not my favorite style of beer, it is all in all, a great beer!","Henderson, Nevada, USA","JohnnyFlake"

The aromas definitely do their job in enticing me to drink the beer.  This beer has an incredible flavor that is complex, sweet, smooth, and creamy.  I believe this is a perfectly balanced Belgian beer.  It feels great in the mouth and has a long malty, fruity aftertaste with no bitterness and very little sourness (not perfect).

Deep, murky ruby brown with a mountainous, creamy head.  Aroma is sweet malt, yeast, dark fruit (plums, raisins) and honey.  Flavor is amazingly complex;  sweet dark fruits, herbal spiciness, sweet malt, caramel and yeast.  Finish is smooth sweet malt and spicy hops.  Creamy and full bodied palate with light, tingly carbonation.  An outstanding beer!

Full bodied maltiness without being sweet or cloying, toffee, nutty, chocolate, plums, fruity esters of all kinds.  Mouthfeel is just as good as the flavors, carbonation leads off but fades to a creamy drinkable swollow.  At first I thought that there might be too much carbonation, but after a few sips and letting it breathe a little I found it to be very pleasing.

2863,"2005-09-12",4.2,"11.2 oz. bottle from the brand new natural foods store on Sawmill Rd., Columbus, OH.  Paid $3.49.  This is a perfect-looking beer; very dark garnet color with a thick, frothy, bubbly, everlasting head that leaves froth all the way down the glass; thick globs of yellow floaties abound.  Aroma is heavy and full: malts, caramel, dark fruit, rotting vegetables, spicy, alcohol; unfortunately the less apparent smells are too subtle.  Flavor is strong and really nice but just not as easily describable as the rest of this beer; taste is malty with sugar and some dark fruits; the alcohol bite is just perfect here, though.  Somewhat more carbonated than I was hoping, and barely thin; otherwise silky and not sticky.  Overall this is a very solid beer; I think some people do overrate this just a tiny bit; I dont quite see the complexity in the flavor that some people claim.

Earlier (From memory:)
Nice nightbrown color w/ an adequate head (I think I recall). Wonderful aroma, almost makes you hungry. The flavor, I must say, is one of my all-time favourites, perfect full bitterness and balanced acid.
It has the kind of feel to it that makes you want to drink one cl at a time, but it is so good that you sip it up very qucikly.
Malty, chocolate, fruity and rich.
Moderate sweetness and tones of dark fruit and dried stuff. Reminds me of Westvleteren Abt. However this one is rawer and not as noble.

2863,"2005-07-19",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2010 Small re-rate - repeated tastings of this incline me to add a few points. I prefer it very lightly cooled down from room temperature. I like the whole line actually - the Pater and Prior are well worth trying, as are the Watou an St. B Tripels. Does the Abt. 12 rule? Yes, but it has a worthy court of subjects.
<P>Small tulip poured from 33cl on BeerBistro patio. (Awesome place.) Small sips of strong, deep rich flavor delivers what the dark colour promises. Bigness. Not exceptionally powerfiul or detailed aroma, but nice dark / mixed dried fruit (pear fig plum rasin) aroma and flavor with austere sweet-baked spicings. Alcohol shows a bit. Elegant and not bad. Might prefer a Koningshoeven Quad though - I must try both again (and Fin Du Monde to see if it hits the spot these days.) St.B12 is very good if not indispensible at first try, but when the expectation is so  built up like this Id better try a few more StB12s to rate more objectively.<P>The server took away my bottle before I was done (hey I paid 13 bucks just to stare at it!).","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DerWeg"

Head and lacing are the most beautiful Ive ever seen, and they retain their timeless character throughout the tasting.  Aroma is chocolate, anise, bananas, cloves, cackled pepper, chocolate éclairs, brown sugar and sugar brazed walnuts.  You can actually feel it slide through the nasal passage.  Flavor is sudden bliss.  So complex.  Subtle yet leading cocoa joins a bakery fresh yeastinesss to concoct a flavorful and rich chocolatey pound cake.  Rolls over the tongue so seductively and is accentuated with the most expertly crafted spices, primarily cloves, pepper and nutmeg.  Effervescent but smooth and full-bodied.

On the palate the beer is massive! Extremely full-bodied, soft and velvety, with the dried fruit element and the chocolate notes at the forefront. There is a nice warming sensation from the alcohol at the end, and the aftertaste hangs in the mouth for several minutes. A fantastic beer!

Flavor was thick and sweet with light acidity and a long finish. Full bodied and mellow with a syrupy texture. Very rich and  tasty, but dont drink too many consecutively.

Thats really a distraction, as it takes away from the taste quite heavily.  A good amount of malts with hints of sour apples, bananas and figs.

This one rocked my world as well as my buds who tasted it tonight. It started with a flowery smell. Aroma-wise it wasnt too striking but it made up for this in taste. I had a bottle aged from 1999. It had a very refined character that was smooth on my tongue with a flowery overtone, some malty tones underneath and some sweet carbonation. The alcohol was definately noticeable. One of my buds had a bottle of Chimay Blue and we noted that while this beer isnt as overpowering taste wise, its finer in many ways. I could drink the foam of this one!

I followed a La Fin Du Monde with this brew and this is clearly better. When I had this for the 1st time a few weeks ago at an in store tasting at Cellars Minnetonka, it seemed overly carbonated and airy and was perhaps served too warm.

2863,"2005-05-11",4.0,"My bottle is warming and is almost ready for its uncorking. This is my first caged, capped and corked beer. Im anxious. I must admit that I have fears about this bottle, as with other top end Belgians I bought from the store. They spent time in a continously lighted cooler, potential months. The Orval and Rochefort 10 were lucious, the Traquair and Founders Imperial Stout were not. Im hoping this falls on the right side of the spectrum. The cork ejects quickly, with vicious power. Carbonation is rising. I sniff the cork. A vinous winy typical cork aroma seeps up my nostrils. Slowly into the Tulip glass goes the beer, it develops a healthy, yet uneven head. Its a pearlescent ivory tone, with fine bubbles and a clearing center. So far so good. To the nose: cherries, plum and a swirling reminsicense of an overdone scotch ale with port and currants. Honey and wine bring back the airy thoughts of a fresh flower field and a dose of potpourri. Savory tones creep in from the sides, with aged oak, balsamic, and juniper berries. The aroma is complex, but not glowing. Brought to the light, this beer glows of deep dark cranberry juice, flecked with yeast like a fresh robins egg. The yeast stays well suspended in a clear blood beer. The beer is opalescent, running from amber to golden to deep red. The carbonation is fine like Champagne. This should be good. Unfortunately on the palate, Im let down. Its a scotch ale, with sherry. Theres more, but first, Im dissapointed. This is one dimensional. When the beer is in my mouth, it bursts into a fury of carbonation and turns into foam. Its not clingy, oily, or sugary. Just a slightly sweet beer, with some water to wash it down. The beer really expands and foams in the mouth, which isnt really a desirable trait for me, since it doesnt give my tounge a chance to participate, instead it just hints at a touch of its taste and then leaves an aftertaste. The flavor is dominated by brandy, apples, and plum pudding. That rich, lucious deep wheat and yeast are most omnipresent, really showing strongly in the middle. The alcohol bursts on the back end, adding a nice growing warmth to the profile. Raisins, sherry and port make flash apperanaces, but dont detract from the quality. I dont think this beer has suffered any age or light damage, it just is what it is. The aftertaste is dominated by green apples and butter diacetyls. The palate is average, with a drying trend. The complexity is pretty good, but the texture and depth seem one dimensional. As the beer has warmed some more, its starting to show more nuances and unveil subtlties, but nothing jumps out at me, the beer just gains more body, tone and depth. The texture gains some chewiness and fullness. A fruit swirl laced on top of a rich yeast and sugar base, with some deeper notes. Overall, Im somewhat let down, but generally pleased with the way the beer has gone, although it leaves me longing for more. Ive enjoyed my time with it, but look forward to new horizons down the road. How fitting for how this past semester of school has gone and my thoughts of a friend I wish I could be closer to. This beer is a true tribute of the evening.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Mouthfeel was creamy, yet well-carbonated.  Fruity aftertaste was very pleasant, and the beer warmed the stomach well.

Dark hazy nut brown, tight brown head. Aroma of licorice, grapefruit, Pernod, sweet plums and apricot. Flavor has raisins, licorice, roasted malts and lots of alcohol - palate is more rude than in Westy12. Funny beer: same time creamy smooth mouthfeel and whiskey-like alcoholic burn.

2863,"2005-04-17",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2006 Its possible that this Belgian quadrupel improves with age, but this sample disappointed. Poured a dark chocolate brown colour with a huge rocky head that receded fairly quickly but barely laced. The aroma was phenolic, with an unusual gingery quality, hints of a raw leathery merlot and a splash of paint, whisky barrel and distant bitter chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel, medium-bodied rather than ""full"". Initial flavour profile includes raisins, dark malt and baked apples. The alcohol is well integrated but the finish has the phenolic quality of the aroma. Theres a lot to like here but I dont think it bears comparison to the Rochefort 10.

AROMA- Very nutty with distinct hops and slightly smokey-caramel aroma. A big, dense head that kept growing and growing 

TASTE- Big, chewy mouth-feel. Tastes of cardamom, caramel, raisins, bourbon. It also seemed slightly salty to me in an odd sort of way. Distinctive flavor of alcohol. Very abbey-y (abbeyish?)

2863,"2005-02-13",4.0,"Bottle. Dark brown beer with a huge beige head. Fruity, malty, yeasty, alcoholic aroma that draws you in for more. Warming full body. Alcohol definately present. Date/raisin/plum flavors. Despite alcohol presence its easy to drink and otherwise well balanced and complex. Alcohol just dominates. If you like an alcohol presence, youll like this over a Rochefort 10, but otherwise it pulls you attention away from everything else.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
2863,"2005-02-09",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2009 Upgraded 3/12.  Had this with avec fromage de chevre.  Enjoyable.


My bias is towards hops (sickening amounts of them), so my reaction to a yeasty-bubbly-carbonationy presentation is slightly short of euphoric.  Sweet, slightly sticky, airy-bubbly body, some head at first but dies off.  Ends up like an Arrogant Bastard in appearance in color and transparency, abstracted from everything else including head or foam retention.  Fruity in a general sort of way.  Ive got a 4-pack of the stuff, so my rating could change on subsequent attempts at joyful consumption.
I think Ive got some stunted scent-receptors, because I just dont detect the complexity in this much less many other of the beers.  I seem to go on intensity more than anything, hence little variance in my scores on this component.  Is it fig in this one?  Alright already, just punch me in the nose with a fistful of hops and Ill be back in my element.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"
2863,"2005-02-09",4.5,"11.3oz bottle. 63.5°. NB worthy glass. Poured  dark chocolate brown with a 1 1/2"" billowy head. Lots of sediment floating at the bottom of the glass. The foam makes it home all over the sides of the glass.  I am a foot or so away from the glass and the aroma is wafting up to me.  When I bend down to smell it, the smell is malty, plums, raisins,  bananas and yeast. The smell is wonderful. The taste is very similar to the aroma, with some breadiness to go along with all the dark ripe fruits and wonderful esters along with a big dose of dark brown sugar.  Maybe it is because of the higher temp that I am enjoying this at, but the alcohol is noticeable, in fact it is a bit detracting.  The finish is fruity and spicy with that alcohol coming through as well.  The beer has a nutty, sweetish aftertaste. The mouthfeel is outstanding, it feels really full in the mouth, especially before the head dies down.  This is a fine beer, it is more forward than Westys 12, which I found to be good, but restrained.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Big aroma with somewhat rancid dimensions, meaning medicine, phenols.  Stale rasins, prunes, leather, maybe plums too, why not?  All of that carries in the sweet malty body.  I step outside on a crisp 2*C Nebraska eve to let the pug puppy out. A neighbor has a fire burning and smoke lingers in the air on this still eve...ah, how nice a rauch abt would be!  The negative aroma comments fade, the beer highlights chocolate and honey of the dark sort.  Some decent bitterness helps add some finesse.  A fine fruit-laden beer.","Nebraska, USA","mdi"

Some good elements here: smooth, insistent choc towards the finish; with a hint of raisin in the mouth.

2863,"2005-02-04",3.2,"Ten years ago I picked up a gift pack containg four different of the Bernardus beers. At the time, I thought the 12 okay but the 8 the star of the show.  Nobody agreed with me.  It looks like people still dont, but my preference is towards the middle versions of these similar lineups (Bernardus, Westvleteren, Rochefort).  This is a dark murky brown with a thick foam.  The aroma is unbalanced - all yeast (dust mainly, but some funk too), with hints of figs, plums and toffee.  The flavour is better with chewy malt depths, more dates, a little bit of chocolate and a sturdy alcohol backbone.  Actually, that alcohol is a little too sturdy.  Fruitcake notes appear as well.  The finish is quite alcoholic and sweet, with not nearly enough nuances to justify a rave.  Its rich, but not all that complex.  Now, where can I buy that Prior?","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

The aroma was not quite as strong as I would have expected.  Very pleasant, but a hair lighter.  The aroma is rich and complicated.  There are many kinds of fruits in the mix, but the  complexity is making it hard for determining individual notes.  The taste is superb.  A complicated sweetness, with a tart underlying flavor.  Fruits, caramel, heaven.  Superb.","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"

Quite an excellent aroma..bananas and peaches.  Of course the yeast was ever-present.

A wee bit expensive, but worth it for a rare occasion!","Ontario, CANADA","Commodore"

2863,"2005-01-13",4.5,"Bottle, Cafe Volo.  Dark Brown pour.  I had a bit of a cold, but I didnt get a strong aroma - more of a muted mixture of sweet malt and a little spiciness.  Tan head that was pretty active - lots of bubbles.  This transferred over to the mouthfeel - very active and bubbly as well.  Strong malt character to taste, a very assertive beer featuring lots of sweetness (a hint of chocolate, but not as predominant as others have made it out to be) and certainly some alcohol, but not overpowering.  This is a perfectly balanced beer.  Heaven in a glass was my final verdict; it is hard to describe but this beer, combined with a wonderful setting of a corner table at Volo with the welcoming company of the owner Ralph on a cold windy night outside, made this one of my best beer drinking experiences in Toronto ever.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"

This one is big, with intense flavors of dark fuitcake and rum, sweet malt, and a slight bitter finish.  Some warming alcohol on the way down, but its well hidden in the excellent flavor.

2863,"2004-10-26",4.4,"25.4 ounce bottle with cork and basket stopper purchased from Wilburs Wine and Spirits in Ft. Collins, CO, for $8.99. Happy birthday to me.   What a beer! Really very unique. The appearance is nothing exceptional -- kind of cloudy like you would expect a BCA to be, but a rich thick head and lots of lacing!  Incredible aroma! Mix chocolate, raisins  & rye bread rising just before it goes in the oven. Wow!  Amazing taste. Very unexpected! Not the flavor I had expected from the color. Raisin, plum, yeast, a ripe banana note, high note of pineapple, but not overly sweet. My friend, who shared part of this bottle said, ""Like baked raisins with all the sugar turned into alcohol."" Not much of the toasted malt or chocolate tastes I had been expecting -- just a total and wonderful surprise!  What a rich, round feel! The bottle said to serve this at 52 to 56 degrees F., and that was right! Smooth without being syrupy -- I hardly wanted to swallow this, it was so nice in the mouth.

Beautiful in the glass: robust brown-black is completely opaque, and the head seems just as thick, much like mousse in its consistency, a nice lighter shade of beige and incredibly (almost pasty) lacing on the side of the glass.  Full bodied and incredibly creamy (melted milkshake thickness).  The complexity in flavor is subtle: you can smell the dark fruits and a bit of the maltiness, and the plums hover right beneath the texture while the beer is in your mouth.  Good sweetness, balanced by bread and a hint of acid.  The aftertaste is light but diffident, and has a gentle hops kick.

Much to my surprize, Im older now still.Original Rating - 9/7/2004 - 6/3/7/2/15 - 3.3....

Color is a dark russet brown, and head is enormous, majestic, utterly awesome!
Aroma hits you right off: earthy, nutty, and not merely deep, but cavernous. Incredibly complex, and utterly gorgeous: cocoa,plum, port wine, medicine, and a very apparent alcoholic character, plus anise, pepper, and more, so much more!
On first sip, I cant help but think that ""complexity"" is a shallow term with which to circumscribe the many aspects of this amazing brew. So much to contend with, so much going on! 
I need to take a breath and reel from the feeling, and seek relief from the rush! Extraordinary!

Aroma is bready, malty, and slightly astringent with fruits and spices.
Flavor is a sweet/tart start with a spicy middle and peppery finish. Flavors are complex and change with temperature. Mellows and smoothes as it warms, but keeps its complexity.
Mouthfeel is effervescent and creamy - mellows as it warms. Full bodied and smooth, yet oily with a bite.

Rich sweet aroma, light coriander and clove spiciness, fruity plum/prune, black pepper, with a healthy dose of alcohol aroma.  As it warms a more herbal aroma became apparent, especially mint.  Cookie dough chewy malts also become obvious as it continues to warm.  Flavour is well-balanced, malty on the front, honeyish, with a fruity middle.

2863,"2004-07-01",4.5,"Blood red pour with a beautiful towering foamy head fed by an onrush of ultra fine bubbles that are like champagne.  The head is immortal.  The aroma is sweet cherries with the uniquely earthy Belgian yeast strain.  The taste at first sip is an explosively spicy alcohol.  After that initial attack, other flavors start to emerge.  The most notable of these is a lingering hop bitterness that is much stronger than most other beers that fall under the broad umbrella of Belgian styles.  The bitterness is not overpowering in any way, and allows the fruitiness of the malt to open up in the background.  I imagine as this fresh beer settles down, the character would become more malty and complex, and thanks to the new Georgia law allowing this elixir to enter our fair state, I can find out how it will age without much problem.  This beer packs a heck of a punch at 10% ABV.  After the 330 ml bottle is downed, there is a fire in the belly that radiates out to the extremities.  Very drinkable, even at this potency.  I WILL be having more.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Rerate - Had this tonight on tap, very very good.  Much better than I remember, but that was about 400 beers ago when I first tasted this beer.  I have since drank it but never on tap.  On tap so much flavor pours out of this one that I feel I did it injustice by not giving it a higher rating.  This one should be up there with Rochefort 10.  Very nice, fruity, yeasty, malty, rich, and just down right dangerously drinkable.  Awesome beer.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

 Re-rate   The draught version was clearly much younger than the bottles I had previously.  Still, the flavor is superb and complex, though age will help balance and mellow.  Never have I pulled such flavor out of the head of a belgian.<P>
Bottle - Sampled alongside Westy 12 and Bernie came out the victor.  While it might be slighly less complex, the creaminess and doughy mouthfeel make this more enjoyable. One could endlessly count the different fruit flavors found inside.  I guess it just comes down to which strain of yeast one prefers.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"

The lacing is so thick I may need a chisel to get it off after I am done. A sweet first impression, but there is a maltiness that comes up too.

Lacing starts as styrofoam sheets but dissolves and sticks in big spots and some globules.

Aroma is soft and subtle, not all that strong but comes across complex enough with dark citrusy fruits of fig, raisin, starfruit, and touches of lemon and banana. Some cocoa sits within and a bit of crispy vanilla and cookie dough sweetness. But as it warms some major yeasty tones take over lending phenolic notes and spicy alcoholic burn.

Yum! Taste is super nice; very soft and subtle, full and scrumptious, nice dulled-like dark citrusy fruit notes dancing upon chewy cookie dough sweetness where pleasing sugars, vanilla, and lingering cocoa wait in the wings to finish it off. Quite a bit of things going on; like a waffer lemon tea cookies meets chewy sweet oatmeal raisin cookie dough with a splash of cocoa. Heavy milk-like thickness upfront, some light chewy malts and cookie sugars dominate the middle where it mingles with a solid carbonation and some wonderfully placed yeasty spices of clove and earthy dryness towards the finish. But this really never gets all that dry at all, it remains full and wet with amazing sugary cookie things. Its fades ever so gently off the palate where a dry spice coats under a sweet malt laden heaven. Mmmm...Liquid bakery flavors of oatmeal cookies, caramel chewy raisin bars, and moist chocolate/cocoa cake with a spritz of darkened citrus in the frosting. Amazing! The yeast sits just right for me, mild yet present with just the right amount of give and take around the middle and into the finish with its clove-like and phenolic spice and alcohol.

Full, fluffy carbonation, semi-chewy, very well rounded and just spicy enough, just the right amount of sweetness and sugarsall combine, and whammo, you've got an amazingly easy smooth, soothingly thick glass of necture here.

Aroma is of heavy, heavy malt, buttered walnuts, various dried fruits, chocolate, and yeast.  Flavor is of heavy, creamy malt, dried fruits, almost chocolate, walnuts, with an extremely delayed aftertaste of vanilla milkshake.  Absolutely outstanding beer.  Alcohol is sometimes noticable with a burn, and sometimes not noticable at all.  This beer is well worth the average of around $6.70 per bottle. Sampled at 68 degrees Fahrenheit.  First rating was from an 11.2 oz. bottle into a snifter glass.  The liquid was colder, cloudy, and had a very large head, but dissipated to near nothing leaving a thin film.

Aroma is earthy and woodsy.  Smells a lot like pumpernickel bread.  Also some sweetness in the aroma too.  Pours a nearly opaque mahogany color with a frothy off white head thats about 2cm.  Start is creamy and smoky and tastes a little bit like Jack Daniels.  Finishes very sweet and honey like.  Pleasant.  This stuff is very yummy and totally exceeded my high expectations.  One of the best Ive ever had.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

Aroma and flavour mainly as the first time, but I drank the beer a little colder now, and the sweetness was not overwhelming. Im upping it a couple points. Original rating: 330 ml capped bottle. I had trouble getting the very hard cap off (no proper opener at hand), and 1/4 of the beer was driven out by the carbonation before I succeeded. Drank it at temp. appr. 14 degrees C. Beer was murky brown with floaties, large tan head. Aroma was malty sweet with prunes, figs, dates, chocolate and cedarwood. Flavour was again malty sweet with prunes, figs, dates and chocolate. No detectable bitterness. A complex beer, but too sweet to be ""perfect"" IMO.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"

Such a lush, full palate and just the right carbonation level.  I believe it was cheaper than the Rochefort too.  It rates right up there witht the best trappist beers!","Glen Ellyn, Illinois, USA","HopasaurusRex"

2863,"2004-03-03",4.3,"A lovely, wonderfully rich dark belgian beer. The nose is of an acceptable strength featuring notes of plums and warm banana bread. Subtle cinnamon hints. A lovely dark colour with very little lacing that fades almost immediately. The taste is incredible, with finishing notes of rum & raisin chocolate.

A strong bready aroma hit me right away. The scent also has apples and alcohol. The flavor has apple, bread and decent malt. It also has a sweet candy, slighty caramel hint.

Aroma is extremely yeasty, brown chocolate in an ocean of yeast, pure cookie dough along with caramel.. It smells sweet and brown. Taste is candi sugar, brown chocolate, hugely malty, but even more so intensively yeasty with a bit of bananas, prunes and plums and a light restrained alcohol bite. Body is medium and creamy. Wow, this is so yeasty, I wouldn't expect this from myself, but maybe too much for its own good.

Pours a very dark brown with a tan head supporting what looks like whisps of cinnamon. A very thick head indeed that really doesn't want to go away. Very nice. Very thick lace clings to the glass.

The smell is very faint because of the thick head sealing the beer, but I can smell some fruit esters, mostly banana.

The taste is spectacular. Fruit esters swirl around the mouth from the first sip. Bananas, apricots, cloves... Wow. Interestingly, no alcohol taste, which is very deceiving. I can't say enough nice things about this beer. The taste is truly spectacular.

Mouthfeel is delightfully creamy with just a touch of a mineral feel to it. Drinkability? Yes please! I found this on sale and I'm definately going back for more.","Port Orchard, Washington, USA","Gromit"

2863,"2004-02-22",4.4,"750 ml. big 'ole brown Belgian bottle. Corked and caged. Best by date of 08/2008. Very fresh and lively. Cork practically shot out of the bottle when I opened it. Lively carbonation makes for a huge, thick tannish colored, meringue like head. Thick and frothy, it was.
Almost like a milkshake. Aromas are of dried fruits, rum soaked raisins, sweet dried dates, some bananas and cloves in the aromas as well. Very fruity tasting. Malts make a surprising start, followed by the dried fruit flavors, and followed up by the slight hop bitterness at the end. No alcohol present in the aromas or flavors, but it is very warming upon impact to your stomach. Very warming indeed. Funny thing about it though, there's no alcohol tastes whatsoever. Bananas and cloves make up the middle of the tastes, and it finishes sweet, but on the dry side. Not cloying, but it does have an immense mouthfeel. This beer trancends the ordinary Belgian ales by leaps and bounds. A great beer, what we call ""mag-nasty"" in these parts of the country. A ""mag-nasty"" beer indeed. ...And that's a good thing.","","Cobra"

Very malty, quite barley-wineous, sweetish-fruity, licoricey flavor with plums and some chocolate hints. Alcohol is well hidden, but warming. Long, sweetish, lingering aftertaste. Smooth but slightly bitter, medium to full-bodied, somewhat foamy-carbonated palate. A very nice, quite complex and fruity brew, although somewhat foamy-carbonated, not that full-bodied (for the style), and maybe an inch too alcoholic in the aroma. Definitely delicious overall, though.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"

Head is nice and thick, and a light mocha color.  Aroma is raisins to the max.  Also some sugary malt, brown sugar and some light spice, maybe cinnamon.  Alcohol perceptive on the nose, and as I dive in, its perceptive on the body as well.  Body is full, but not heavily so.  More raisins, light, light yeast on the finish, some lightly phenolic candied sugar as well.  The sweetness and raisiny/fig flavor seemed a bit too dominant.  Mouthfeel was pretty nice, smooth with a tinge of carbonation.  I thought Rochefort 10 was much more complex.On draught January 2005 at Anam Cara Not quite as sweet as I remember, but still a rather sticky, doughy, candy jumbled mess.

I don't get much of a scent... a tiny hint of something, but it's so weak I can't give a good rating here.

I don't know if I got a bad bottle or if this is what this beer is supposed to taste like, but it's absolutely awful. Reminds me of eating a banana peel that's been rotting in the trash can for a few days. Finishes with a stronger taste of booze than Ketel One. With the high reviews, I must have a bad one. It's got 4 6 7 notched, though I could only guess what that could possibly mean.

It's got a decent mouthfeel, but it sure is hard to keep in my mouth for very long.

I'll assume I got a bad one. I've strong beers before that I quite enjoyed... a few with a higher alcohol content. This, whether it's a bad bottle or not, is undrinkable. I'll try it again and rerate if necessary.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","hershiser2"

Large amounts of lacing can be observed.  The aroma of this beer is just fantastic, dates, plums and what I think to be black cherries.  On first sip you get a huge wallop of plums and dark cherries,  along with what could be best described as a dark nutty yeasty bread flavor.  The finish doesnt hang around for long, but you do get a sense that this is a high ABV brew with its lingering sweet alcohol finish.  Having not had many Quads, I cant compare it to anything.

In my chalice, it is beautiful to the eye, with murky burgundy color and floating yeasties, regardless of the fact that I poured it slowly.  Aroma is sweet and complex, and this carries over to an alcohol warming flourish and candy like finish. Just noticed that the bottle is overflowing again, despite the fact I half emptied it.

As it warms up it gets a bit more sweet, more fruity, and it loses a bit of the astringency in the finish.  A great example, and a must try for anyone.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2863,"2003-10-26",4.7,"Raisiny aroma to it. Almost plum like. Very nice beer to drink. Strong in flavor. This was very good. Malty. One of the best belgians I have tried. Its about 9.50 a bottle but its well worth it. Many different fruit aromas here, but the one that stands out is the raisin. Dark red in color. Full bodied beer.

This beer can best be described with one word: RAISINS! The aroma almost smelled exactly like a box of raisins. Beer is deep red and almost purple in color. Flavor was mellow and smooth. Many different fruits mix here, but most notable was raisin. I am certain there were plenty of others as well.

Exceptional.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","tallmatt67"
2863,"2003-10-19",4.3,"One fine beer.  Starts a little sour and with a dry, chalky (tanic) palate.  As it approaches room temperature the nose and the taste become more complex.  The sourness is overwhelmed by dry fruit (yeah, figs and raisins sound about right), sweet toffee, chocolate ... but none of the flavors as intense as in a Rochefort 10.  No need to quibble.

Big pffffft! So glad I bought the glass cuz its perfect and enhances the whole experience greatly. Dark brown in color and almost opaque. Quickly diminishing tan creamy head that clings to the side of the glass in sheets. Aroma is tutti-frutti with a deep caramel malt character. Goobers and Raisinettes with alcohol filled centers.

2863,"2003-10-12",3.6,"Dark brown hue with ruby highlights. A big creamy off-white head produced outstanding lace. Very earthy aroma of wood, hayfield, belgian yeast, raisin, and spiced bread. The taste was initially very ripe fruity, sourdoughy and sugar candy sweet. Moderate spice and woody characteristics are found between the layers of malt. The mouthfeel is sticky in the lips and chalky dry on the palate. This full-bodied brew produced some excellent qualities but comes up far short compared to Westy 12 and Rochefort 10.

Not as complex as it could be and its a little syrupy, but still excellent. Pours a massive head with sediment throughout, chocolaty brown with a fair amount of carbonation. Aroma jumps across the room, powerfull malt presence with hints of raisin, chocolate and fig. Flavor is malty with a strong alcohol presence, lots of dark fruit, cherries, plum, and hints of chocolate. A little too much alcohol in the body is this beer's only flaw, it is as close to perfect as anything I have found.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","ToadMan"

This one is a little hazy (unlike westy). Head is creamy and full leaving it's lacy fingers all over the side of the glass. Aroma is yeasty almost like a bakery with a fresh sour dough feel, the grape and fig notes are a little more subdued but the dark fruits are there. Flavor has some detectable alcohol (again unlike westy) with a slight cloying sweet dough kick in the end. Finishes with a slighty heavy body to remind you you're drinking a 10% beer, but still rich and complex.

2863,"2003-08-24",3.8,"Cloudy, brown colored body with a very thick, boldly bubbled, light-khaki colored froth that lazes around throughout the whole drink.  Smells of wine, both a dark port and a light buttery-apple chardonay. Its a very inviting smell has me salivating. Mouthfeel is thin and sleek like wine, with a savory creamlike quality. Nearly no carbonation. Alcohol floods the palate along with deep, well defined fruity malts: apple and dark grape. As the fruit flavors gingerly disipate, the taste moves to caramel, then finishes slightly bitter at the very end. This is a pleasing beer, but suprisingly, I liked the Weyerbacher Quad a bit more as it presented more balanced flavors. This beer drinks more like a wine and the alcohol is somewhat distracting. Still, an excellent beer deserving of its current rank. Now, I really can't wait to see how my Westvleteren 12 is going to taste.

The appearance of the beer is a deep amber almost crimson/black, I’m amazed at its nearly opaque body. This is another beer that has lacing like insolating foam; it never subsides and sticks to the glass forever. The flavor is rich, it’s magically complex, I can make out flavors like, prune, apricots, raisons, figs, its all very fruity and earthy, I also am picking up hints of the yeasts. The mouth feel is soft, and the palate is oily, yet this ale finishes ever so dry.

Definate chocolate and malt undertones with some fruit and yeast flavours hitting in the very back of my palate. This is less malty than the Westy 8 and Rochefort 10 (which I prefer) and I would say is more complex because it isn't overriden by malt. I would rank this one lower than Westy 12 (still the best beer ever in my book) but higher than both Rochefort 10 and Westy 8. A great beer for a great price. Definately try to get your hands on this beer if you don't want to spend the money on those earlier named beers or if you've tried all three of them.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
2863,"2003-05-20",4.8,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2004 Thick, redish pour, with a bubbly, creamy tan head.  Aroma of yeast and dough, with a slight wine scent.  First taste is delightfully spiced.  Flavors ot malt, fruit, chocolate, and bread dance on your tongue.  Oh man.  This is one fabulous Belgian Quad ale. I know that Westvleteren 12 gets higher marks from most people, but this beer is such a great price in comparison.  This is definately a favorite of mine.  I'm vey impressed. Purists may ignore it because it isn't a ""real"" Trappist ale, but it definately up there with the best.  I'd certainly rank it up a notch above Chimay Bleu.  It has at least the complexity of Rochefort, and the alcohol taste is better masked.  It's especially important to note that this beer costs HALF of the price of Rochefort 10.  I LOVE this beer.  This beer really is the little brother of Westvleteren Abt 12.  There is some good information about this beer on:

http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-0014 />
Evidently, the brewery in Watou produced similar beers for St. Sixtus in Westvleteren, for commercial distribution, until the monastery upgraded their brewery in the early 1990s.  So, while it's not an ""official"" Trappist beer, it certainly stands up just as well to the best of the best.","Illinois, USA","zborgerd"

2863,"2003-04-07",4.8,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2007 ***The re-re-rate... 750 ml bottle... This beer rocks!...  Murky, very dark brown brew which reveals burnt orange highlights when held up to a lamp. Large, frothy, khaki head. Excellent retention. The nose is fruity and malty with notes of dark fruit, apple, fuzzy fruit, pear and chocolate. The flavor is malty and rich, but has excellent balance. Dark fruit, light bitterness, chocolate. Medium to full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Chocolatey, balanced finish. The high ABV is very well-hidden. A beautifully constructed beer! World Class!
***The re-rate***...  I tried another 12 oz. bottle at Monks Cafe in Philly. My following rating holds. I really dig this brew! 
This beer rocks! Whats not to like about this beer? The appearance is murky and forbidding with a deep orange/red color that Ive not seen before. Very large creamy, khaki-colored head. The head diminishes slightly, but is everlasting and leaves very strong lacework on the glassware.
The aroma is very rich and complex with all kinds of Belgian malt and Belgian yeast induced fragrances. Russian Black Bread dough, dark chocolate, Chanel No 5, lime, alcohol, dark grapes, overripe plums, dates, French oak, brown sugar, nutmeg, chalk and yes, a fresh, unused Band-Aid brand bandage. Ok, that about covers it. The flavor is of warm, sweet Belgian rum, caramel, molasses, prunes, alcohol and cola up front. Nicely balanced Belgian ale as my mouth was enveloped by dizzingly pleasant hop bitterness, orange blossom honey sweetness and a woodsy, grassy, straw-laden earthiness on the backside.
Full-bodied with a buttery and syrupy mouthfeel and lively carbonation.
A lengthy, flavorful, dry, alcoholic and astringent finish. ***Original rating... Bottle...This beer rocks!...  What a brew! Personally, I might like this one as much or more than Westy 12... I MIGHT!

3/21/2003: Thick dark murky body with a good layer of foam on top.  Sweet bready Belgian yeast aroma with no alcoholic notes.

Dark, malty, raisiny flavor. Hints of black cherry and bannana. Caramel and brown-sugar flavors become slightly more pronounced as the beer warms. Overall, pleasantly sweet in flavor.

Interesting array of aromas; bananas, green apple, alcohol, slight raisin, and a little bready.  Flavor is well balanced and clovey; fruity and alcoholic.

The body is a very dark brown, cloudy. The nose is earthy, similar to some of the smells of a vegetable garden towards the end of harvest. The first flavor that hit me was cotton candy but this was while I was getting nothing but foam. It also seemed a little hot then. There's a butteriness to it that blends nicely into the chocolate and toffee malts. Ripe bananas over peaches a bit past their prime meld in nicely as well. Very low bitterness and the alcohol is covered extremely well. There's also a slight vinous character to it and there's something there that reminds me of the homemade wine my church uses for Communion. The mouth feel is very slick and creamy.

First taste is very reminiscent of West 12, very sherryish and fruity, with hints of chocolate and figs, and dries off nicely.

2863,"2002-12-03",4.3,"The Westvleteren brewery in the abbey of St Sixtus decided to contract the brewing of its commercial product to the St Bernardus brewery at Watou from the end of WWII until 1992 when it took back the rights to the term Trappist and now brews the commercial brands itself. Until that date in 1992, this was a Trappist beer, after that date it became an Abbey beer. When it lost its Trappist status the name St Sixtus was removed from the label. It would be interesting to drink this with a bottle of Westvleteren 12 to see who really does make a better job of the recipe. From what I understand St Bernardus has the original yeast so Westvleteren had to get their yeast from Westmalle. The alcohol is well used to add depth and flavour to a very creamy, smooth, sweet and fruity brew. Quite delicious.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

Complex, but not very strong nose of malts, raisins, dried fruit, molasses, port-notes. Fantastic flavor, all complex components of the aroma, wonderfully balanced, sweet and bitter. Extremely long-lasting finish, dry and bittersweet. One of the most well-balanced brews i know. And it doesnt even taste like it peaks at this age, it might even get better when older.... Fantastic brew, and well worth aging. Original rating: This is a very nice one! One of the best aromas out there, strong, fruity, sourness and some caramel. Appearance is nearly perfect: cloudy dark-brown with a thick long-lasting head. Very malty flavor, full and a bit fruity. Nice smooth and long lasting finish. Alcohol is very well hidden. The only flaw of this beer is perhaps that its a bit too sweet, but aging could make this better. Ill keep the second bottle in my cellar for a few years. If i can wait... ;-).

The brown body is opaque rather than cloudy, and the head is light tan and only medium thick. Nose is malty, with a doughy sweetness. First sip is mostly cookie dough, medium sweet. Alcohol is noticeable in the finish, although inoffensive. Continuing... I know Westy 12; Ive tasted Westy 12; Ive rated Westy 12, and, Senator, you are no Westy 12. Im surprised that this is in the top 50; my example was a middle-of-the-road dubbel.

The lack of super obvious alch. nose is a plus in my book. Then the taste: some high alcohol, like the Rochefort 10, but more malty (in fact this malt is kind of like the depth [user_ex calls it malt syrup] found in Double Enghien Brune, but without the hops to counteract).

2863,"2002-04-25",4.6,"Luxurious and hearty warming brew. Pronounced maltiness is close to chocolaty with a strong dark fruitiness. Smooth and sweet, there is a nice accomodating oakiness that just tempers things down. I preferred the Tripel, my tastebuds are still a little immature when it comes to strong ales, but this one is still nothing short of outstanding.","California, USA","BeerLimey"
2863,"2002-04-21",4.3,"This is a heavy guy. Lots of tastes and flavors, very complex, maybe too complex. I could suggest this one to every one.","Oostende, BELGIUM","Stijn Cuylle99"
2863,"2002-04-18",4.3,"Murky brown meaty red colour with a intermediate lasting beige head. Wierd aroma, swish the glass and you get an immediate puff of wonderful fruit, banana and sultana, that fades to malty/yeast. Smooth senous palate firing up the full range of tastebuds and adding to those in the nasal passages. The flavour starts as slightly sweet moving to a full bodied toasted malt/yeast. The closest I could get to an overall description was marmite or vegemite, but its  well balanced with the other bitter sweet flavours all the way to the bitter end. Im going to have to get myself a few more and try them at different temperatures. Im calling this one Africa, deep, dark and mysterious and worth exploring some more.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","OlJuntan64"

2863,"2002-03-01",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2014 Bottle (BB Dec 18, 2017).

Head is initially average sized, frothy/fizzy, light brown, mostly lasting.
Body is hazy dark brown, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is moderately malty (walnuts/pecans, caramel), moderately yeasty (basement), with notes of brown sugar, alcohol, raisin, overripe banana.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, watery/syrupy/velvety texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

A very easy-going, straightforward quad...pleasant but simple in the nose (walnuts, sugar, and yeast dominate everything else)...drinkable but still too sweet (and somewhat watery, syrupy, and fizzy) in the mouth.  Similar to Rochefort 10 in that its without flaws but uninspiring and somewhat lacking in depth and finesse; low/mid-3s in quality.  I re-sampled fresh bottles of Westy 8 and 12 recently as well and thats still by far the pick of the Trappist (and similar pseudo-Trappist) brews (not counting Orval, since its in an odd class all its own, of course), its not even close (Westy is still 4+ as of 2013, IMHO, totally without any bias and quite a bit of skepticism to be honest).","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2863,"2002-02-26",3.1,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2012 I sensed a medicinal aroma, along with alcohol, custard, banana bread, chocolate chip cookies and tropical fruits; pours a sticky, creamy, large and small interwined bubbled foam;  purple haziness that reminds me of Aventinus weizen-eisbock;  palate detects hard water used in this beer which is similar to the 6 and the 8; lively carbonation hits the mouth;  I tasted musty yeast, chocolate, vanilla cake with a wonderful creaminess; initial sip was numbing to my palate; alcohol is very warming;  this beer finishes with hints of bananas and a lingering marshmallow creme taste that lasts near a minute.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2863,"2002-02-18",4.4,"Huge head.  Nice complex aroma and flavor.  A very good, complex BSA.","Acworth, Georgia, USA","belgianhomebrew"
2863,"2002-02-07",4.4,"Ive only had the St. Sixtus version of this beer, but what a beer!!!! Phenomenol. A strong flavor, and a higher alcohol content that Deüval. Drink two and call me in the morning.","Toledo, Ohio, USA","LuckeyHaskins99"
2863,"2002-02-06",4.4,"Color; a mysterious brown.  The glass I have it in refracts the light in interesting ways and creates all sorts of different shades of brown.  The center is strictly murky (this is good).  The head is monstrous and thick with the proverbial Belgian lace sticking all over the glass.  The aroma is complex with hints of mustiness, fruitiness and slight tartness.  The bubbles that are everywhere in the glass were no indication of what was to come.  The palate was very clean and not bubbly like I had anticipated.  More high marks for that feature.  Flavor: Full bodied doesnt begin to describe the complexity of the flavor.  From a sweet/sour combination up front to warm, doughy raisny middle then a bit of alcohol in the finish.  This is a great finisher and a top class beer in my book.","Acworth, Georgia, USA","billb"
2863,"2002-02-06",3.2,"Actually I was somewhat disappointed with this beer.  There was just something about it that tasted off.  Maybe I had an oxidized bottle.  all I know is I have tried many other that were better.  I will re-rate.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"

2863,"2001-12-14",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2007 Strong aroma of vanilla pudding and raisin. Dark brown color, beige head, good lace. Sweet, very flavorful, vanilla, raisin, light butty and some nutmeg. Full yet sparkling.","Delft, NETHERLANDS","jbrus"
2863,"2001-10-22",3.7,"Beautiful head, cloudy brown colour. Aroma of apple and blackcurrant. The taste does not live up to the aroma: it is fruity with a slightly disgusting sweetness. The finish is long with a touch of acidity.","SWITZERLAND","Rutzicka"
2863,"2001-07-14",3.4,"dark brown, nice head; aroma: banana, powerful, one-dimensional; taste: way too sweet; aftertaste: banana, long and disgusting - I was once a great fan of this beer but I have now to admit that my passion for sweet beers has dramaticaly slowed down","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"
2863,"2001-05-22",4.4,"Clearly brewed in the style of Rochy 10 and Westy 12, this beer features a great combination of fruits, nuts and alcohol on the palate. Very hearty and characterful.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
2863,"2000-10-13",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2003 Dark brown color, reddish tinge, fully foaming head.  Apples and plums in the aroma and flavor.  Incredibly smooth and rich, satisfying.  Lighter in body but truly excellent.  Lights hints of chocolate.  Strong carbonation carries fruits through the palate easily.  Top notch.  10% ABV!  Unbelievable!  I'm giving it an extra point for not even hinting at alcohol.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
