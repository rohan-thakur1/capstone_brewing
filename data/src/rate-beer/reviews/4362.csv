4362,"2014-08-19",3.4,"Appearance: Black body with a gorgeous creamy light tan head. It leaves some lacing on the glass.

Aroma: Earthy and but predominantly spicy noble hop scent. I pick up a hint of caramel in the background as well. The scent of this beer isnt that strong, so I really have to get my nose close to it to draw out the aromas.

Taste: Light roasted flavor, a bit of charcoal but only a light bitterness at the back of the tongue. The bitterness does linger though. Some of the hops come through as a bit spicy and it does a good job of increasing the richness of the beer.

Palate: The beer has a fairly strong presence on the palate without being heavy. Its like eating a piece of steak with a well-crusted exterior. It finishes medium-dry leaving just a touch of softness after a sip. It does have a bit more of a sweeter mouthfeel than I would want.

Overall: I think this is a good beer. It has a good balance of roasted flavor and hop spice to make it well worth drinking. It is a very clean beer, having only flavors that I would expect.","","teromous"

4362,"2013-06-30",3.7,"16 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a very dark ruby color. It only shows hints of opacity when put against a moderately strong light. The head is a three finger mocha shade that doesnt retain particularly well, as expected. Having said that, I love the soft creaminess of the texture, with just a hint of rockiness to suggest its well hopped. Lacing left on the glass is quite plentiful, also.

S: I get some dark fruit esters, roasted malts, cream, chocolate, caramel, noble hops, and brown sugar on the aroma. Not terribly groundbreaking on its own, but quite impressive given the style. I could certainly compare it to a good porter/stout aromatically.

T: An initial wave of dry chocolate soon gives way to a combination of roasted malts and grassy hops on the back end. While its simplistic and straightforward, its also enjoyably balanced and easy to drink.

M: Its crisp and dry like a good lager should be. On the other end of the spectrum, it actually does a good job of feeling somewhat substantial. At times, the general feel is more reminiscent of a porter than a dinky-ass schwarzbier.

O: I wasnt sure what to expect from this one - its a schwarzbier, yet one of the top examples of the style according to BA. Luckily, Im finding this one pretty damn good. Probably the best schwarz Ive had yet, in fact.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

4362,"2013-02-19",3.9,"16 oz bottle warmed to about 55F and served in a goblet.  Pours dark black with ruby/mahogany highlights only seen when backlit. Has a thick tan head that soon settles to a lasting ring and partial coat.  Smells of dark baked bread and roasted malts with some earthiness and spice from the hops and hints of dark fruits and chocolate. 
Roasted malts dominate in a flavor that could be a porter. Not only considerably less sweet than a typical Schwarzbier, but a bit more bitter than sweet. This bitterness is mild, however, even in the coffee-tinged finish. Both finish and aftertaste provide a substantial contribution of very dark-roasted grain flavor. 

Smooth and creamy, with a semi-dry finish and a medium-full body. Very good carbonation level.

The pour is near black with an initial two-finger tan had that settles down pretty quickly without leaving much lacing behind. Theres just a slight film of light foam on top. Initial whiff brings some light roast and some mild, smooth chocolate.

Flavor is light chocolate and some very mild coffee. Theres some light roast malt there as well in addition to a very light amount of caramel. Mouthfeel is light and airy without all that much carbonation. This finish is moderately dry. Pretty good, but nothing fantastic. Definitely not a mind-altering schwarzbier.

Aroma: Faint overall aroma smells slightly sweet. From the smell alone the use of coffee and bittersweet chocolate is obvious.

Taste is of coffee and milk chocolate with lots of fruit such as blackberries, dark cherries and nuts.  I almost didnt order this beer because I havent had too many Schwarzbiers but Im glad I did.  Its very much like a stout but lighter on the palate and with less bitterness.

4362,"2008-11-18",3.7,"22oz bomber. Pours a deep, dark black - but not opaque. Dark brown and ruby highlights shine through. The head pours thin and light, is short-lived, and leaves no lace. The aroma is dark toast breadiness and mild chocolate with some caramel sweetness. The flavor starts a little roasty like sweetened coffee - bready and toasty with a light roastiness that more closely resembles over-toasted bread than it does coffee. There is a strong caramel sweetness with a light, grainy malt tang. At mid-palate there is a fruity hop bitterness, strong roasted character, and stronger malt sweetness. The finish is mostly full with chocolate and coffee notes, a pleasant hop bitterness, and a balancing sweetness. The mouthfeel is crisply carbonated but sticky and thick in body. Overall - a pleasant black lager. It’s a bit big and roasty for Schwarzbier I think, but tasty nevertheless. Great for cool fall weather.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

How: Bottle 22oz (beautiful black and gold bottle with waxed top).  Consumed very fresh a few days after purchase
The look: Very dark ruby (almost black) topped by a beige ring of foam
In long: Light-medium roastiness.  That cool doughy lager+cookie malts feeling.  Very nice pillowy body.  Some fruit cake, some dark caramel, some dark grapes, light chocolate presence, some Orio cookies.  More milk-chocolate as it warms up.  Not a very tasty but a very cohesive one where each element takes it place and makes for an overall extra satisfying dark lager.  Very nice offering.

This beer looks lovely in a classic Schwarzbier style glass.  It smells fresh and roasty, complex and intriguing, with caramelly malt, milk chocolate, brown sugar, licorice, and dry, dark fruits.  There is a softness to the aroma, which is inviting and pleasant, almost gentle.  Yet when the first sip is taken, the soft aroma gives way to a very straight-forward, mocha-like taste, burnt and toasty, with raisins, cocoa, damson and plums.  However porter-like this might first seem, the mouthfeel gives way to a smooth, velvety creaminess, and ends crisp, satisfying and pleasantly bittersweet, reminding the drinker that this is in fact a lager, and a very impressive dark lager indeed.","Independence, Kentucky, USA","shalloWMeans"

The beer pours out a jet black liquid, a nice light brown two-finger thick head with some legs on it. Aroma that I was picking up was chocolate, coffee, caramel chews. Flavor left me wondering if this in fact wasnt some kind of stout. It had several of the same characteristics of a stout. Roasted/coffeeish malts, dark chocolate, and molasses.

A small soapy note pops up when warmer, but altogethor its a nice beer, very drinkable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

The foamy tan head disappears quickly, and when held up to direct light, red highlights come through making this not opaque..but beautiful! Initial whiff reminds of a wet dog on summer day. Strange. Nose develops into a celebration of malts; peat smoked, roasted, chocolate, woodsy notes, followed by hints of coffee, vanilla, and a squeeze from a lemon wedge. Light and thin mouth feel but not lacking flavor. Coffee, chocolate, and some muted caramel malt are first to come through in the flavor, followed by notes of prunes, smoke, and molasses.

A one-finger thick head of tan foam faded into a thin layer of small, lasting bubbles.  No lace.  The aroma of this beer was made up of rich caramel notes, chocolate, and a light smokiness.  The flavor consisted of an abundance of balanced malts.  Notes of chocolate, coffee, and caramel all intertwined seemlessly with a hint of dark fruit sneaking in towards the end.

It has definite coffee, chocolate, toasted malt, and even some flowery/spice elements, with a nice blend of sweet and bitter.  The flavour is strong and lasting, but light and exceedingly smooth.  It is more carbonated than it first appeared and it has a pleasant, lively yet creamy palate.

Minimal spotty, sudsy lacing dots the glass.  The nose is comprised of rich caramel, nougat, and chocolate malts, accompanied by indiscernible dark fruits and hints of vanilla.  The flavor shows lightly roasted chocolate malts, caramel, nougat, and lightly oaked vanilla.  There is minimal hop bitterness, though the oak adds a sharpness that helps to balance out the sweet malts.  Medium-full body with a substantial, slick mouthfeel.  Short chocolate finish.

I like Schwarzbiers, and Im not opposed to Sprecher (although they are more pretentious than the better Lakefront and Milwaukee Ale House brands).  Anyway, this pours very dark with a dark head.  It looks like a porter, smells like a porter, but tastes a bit heavier than that, with definite coffee-ground flavors that are not as bad as youd think.  Smoky finish and thin mouth feel.

I have had a few of these and figured it was about time to rate it.  Coming from Sprecher my expectations were not that great but this was a pleasant surprise.  It didnt blow me away but it was not found totally lacking as most of their beers are.  This may be the sort of thing that I would pick up occasionally for a change of pace.
Aroma / Appearance - A fluid dark brown body swirled around the glass.  A sandy thin head sat on top for a few minutes then began to fade into the rest of the liquid.  Smoky malts, black coffee and the dregs of a pot of coffee.  It was pretty plain but that is typical for most schwarzbiers I have tried so far.
Flavor / Palate - A thin mouthfeel coated the mouth in a bit of smoke and dark fruits.  Toffee and slight bitterness reminded me somewhat of a sweet stout without the roasted malts.  The figgy dry finish makes a strong impression before it fades.  It could be more complex but it is still pretty satisfying.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Chocolate and smoked meats in the aroma, with a hint of bitter coffee.  Medium-to-full, roasted and (surprisingly) smoky mouthfeel: the smoke character is rather spicy, almost like a Slim Jim or beef jerky, but in a beer form; the closest similarity I can think of is HOTD Adam, although thats a heck of a lot more dense and less sessionable; excellent roasted coffee and chocolate creaminess coming through mid-palate, taking over where the initial smokiness and spice leave off; dense, generous, and damn good.

I leaves layer-like lacing and the residual crown looks like coffee does when the cream is first poured in...

This beer poured the darkest shade of brown you can get before it turning to black. Deep dark mahogany edges where the light actually manages to fight its way through. A 1 finger creamy mocha cap sits up top after the pour and fades down to a solid creamy cap. This beer looks relly nice on the pour.

The smell invites you in for that first sip. Lots of dark creamy malts. Thats right, this beer actually smells creamy. Along with the dark malt there is a hint of molasses and even hazelnut. On top of all that theres a drop or two of cream/milk. Makes my mouth water on this cold evening.

Mmm.. all the aromas are right there in the taste. Starts of doughy and bready for the backbone. The hazelnut and cream both make an appearence and blend nicely. On the swallow I pick up the smallest touch of licorice/anise. Nice touch of accidity. Packed with flavor. For this style Black Bavarian is about as good as Ive sampled.

Medium body that gets thinner as it works its way through my mouth. Creamy and smooth. Finishes dry. Nicely done.

On a cold night this could be sipped the whole night through. The lower abv allows you to drink all night. Very easy going down.

This is an excellent made beer from Sprecher. Ive seen this around but always passed it by for some reason. Im sorry that I didnt try it sooner. Great example of the style. Loaded with flavor.

4362,"2007-04-10",3.8,"Bottle.  Last one out of a four pack, reserved specifically for rating.  

I allowed this lager to sit on the kitchen counter for roughly 10 minutes 

after opening to warm a bit before sampling.  When I say this is a big 

beer, Im not talking about big flavor or big aroma only.  The large, 

brown 16 oz. bottle that Sprecher Black Bavarian comes in allowed me to 

do the following: I poured two servings - one in a goblet so as to better 

capture the aromas, and one in a tall, flared pilsener glass. This has to 

be one of the best beers that comes packaged in a twist-top bottle. 

Appearance is dark brown, but has a burgundy-ish hue when held up to a 

lightbulb.  Head is a very light caramel color and mostly diminishing. 

Has a nice, sweet, inviting yeasty and vinous aroma, which must be one of 

the hallmarks of a schwarzbier.  The smell of chocolate malts are 

apparent also. Just enough hop bite to give it some character.  Texture 

is thickish, palate is extremely smooth and clean.  This dark offering 

from Sprecher goes down very easily.  I could drink these all afternoon, 

if the generous 5.8% ABV would let me.  The nice young lady with pigtails 

at The Keg Liquors in Clarksville IN must have spent 15 minutes trying to 

find a four pack of this for me in their walk-in cooler.  It was time 

well spent, as I have thoroughly enjoyed this dark lager.  Thanks to

The flavor features a heavily roasted coffee taste with a dash of dark chocolate and a hint of lemon. Delicious! Long, bitter, coffee-like aftertaste. Medium body. Lively in the palate.

4362,"2007-01-10",3.7,"Pours with a fluffy, initially three-finger thick, creamed chocolate to tan colored head that sits atop a simply black colored beer.  The aroma is full of roast malt notes; notes of burnt espresso beans, roasted grain husks, and even some notes of burnt toast towards the end dominate the aromatic profile.  This has a nice malty profile, yes it leans towards roasted grains, but there is also a nice, dry malt character here that, besides the roast profile, leans towards biscuit-like notes and toasted bread character.  Perhaps a touch of spicy hop aromas are here as well, but only just so.

The taste is medium full on the palate, and actually has quite a bit more body than I was expecting from the aroma.  In fact there is a solid malt sweetness here that really brings out a chocolate note that was not in the aroma.  The long finish leads a lingering note of burnt toast, bitter espresso and even some biting hop bitterness.  The finish really serves as a nice foil for the sweeter malt / chocolate notes that are noticeable in the fore-front.  There is enough roasted grain in this beer that it even has some roast derived acidity to it, it is not overly noticeable, but instead helps to balance some of the sweeter, rounder malt notes.  This certainly evokes thoughts of chocolate covered malt balls that have an espresso bean core (wouldnt that be a confection).

This is quite an enjoyable brew, and I am quite happy that it came in a 16oz package as it is the perfect beer to have more than twelve ounces of.  Perhaps a touch to hard with the acidity and bitterness in the finish, but enjoyable all the same.  Before I know it this beer is gone, so I must have liked it.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4362,"2006-05-10",4.1,"While pouring the beer into the glass it looks like liquid chocolate - in the glass it looks like oil with a nice brown head.  The aroma is like toasted chocolate that is rich and inviting.  Medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation that is a bit sprintzy, but it still seems to take the flavors through the mouth.  Taste is chocolate and malty with rich caramel.  The finish is lightly bitter hops.  Further down the glass the carbonation calms down and the beer takes a velvety character.  A wonderful beer that would be a perfect dessert.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

Its aroma is of chocolate and carmel. Very creamy on the palate, with a malty taste, not bitter. Its finish is clean, crisp, slightly dry with a hint of coffee that is very pleasing.

Flavours are much of the same. Roasty, chocolate, with a mild fruity sweetness. Smooth finish, lingering fruit and coffee flavours. A good session schwarz, if there is one. Thanks so much Phil! As a side note, I have heard that if you put some spring water in this one, it will bring it down to about 4% ABV, and it will then seem like a mild stout. Ill have to try it.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"

Nothing to be overly excited about, but this rather dull taste leads to a wonderful lingering finish with dark chocolate, roasted malt, & light hops with a metallic hint.  Medium body with a slick/sticky mouth feel.  This one just did not do it for me as much as other schwarzbier.

4362,"2006-01-25",5.0,"Black Bavarian is a schwarzbier or ""black beer"" by style, and is one of the finest examples I have ever had the pleasure to taste. This style of beer originated in Eastern Germany, and it is a darker, roastier version of Munich Dunkles. This beer is just packed with lots of flavor, and being a lager, it is just so drinkable. 

Sprecher Black Bavarian pours to an ebony color with a thick, tan, bubbly head, and a good bit of carbonation. When held to the light, this beer is really a beautiful dark ruby color. The nose on this beer is a joy. Aromas of roasted malt, sweet malt, and a touch of smoke flood the nose. The palate is just packed with malt flavors, lots of good sweet malt, a bit of roast, and a touch of coffee. This is a lager, so the body is very smooth and round. Black Bavarian finishes with a long, dry, roasty, finish that slightly lingers. 

Without a doubt, this beer is one of the best I have ever tasted, and an all time favorite of mine. This beer goes great with German fare of course. I have matched it with grilled bratwurst, or grilled chicken. It also works very well with barbecue. Seek this beer out if you can find it, it is one of the few domestic examples of schwarzbier, and in my opinion, the best example on the market today.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

4362,"2006-01-06",4.0,"(16 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with hopdog, thanks Steve!) Back in February of 1999, I threw a big ""1000th Beer Party"" complete with t-shirts.  That night, I rated my 1000th beer, and it was Sprecher Black Bavarian.  Nearly seven years have passed, and Im well over 3100 now.  But this was an awesome beer to celebrate on that historic evening, and I still really love this beer.  Malty, very roasty, and moderately bitter, this beer also presents a light sourness, but also a hops flavor I can actually taste, some light spices, very tasty chocolate and molasses, and a moderate smokiness.  Overall, superb balance and a real nice complexity here.  Aromas are more basic: roast, chocolate, molasses, spice, light smoke.  Medium-full bodied with lively carbonation on the palate, and a greater variety of intriguing flavors to spice up the mouthfeel.  Very dark brown, ruddy highlights at the edges, but nearly black through the center.  The light tan head barely rises to a quarter inch in height, and then settles to a ring, leaving no lacing on the glass.  Even after all these ratings, its still one of the best dark lagers Ive ever tasted.

A good run of those ubiquitous european hops. Fairly well balanced, but for me, overall unimpressive. Solid, german beer. RERATE. I had this again and enjoyed the coffe and roasted oak notes, but found the hop notes subdued and missing. There were some sour fringes and metallic bites that left me a little unbalanced.

The first taste ii s like a chocolate milk with coffee. I am loving this. The carbonation is low which leads to an excellent drinkability.  There is a creaminess to this that takes the flavor to a level of enjoyment I cant quite put into words. The finish is smooth like a babys butt, and the coffee + chocolate flavors settle into the nose long after the drink is gone.  This is a great brew. Thanx again Duane.

Loads of roast; nice lagery yeast character that never gets to the heavy point that I really dont like in many lagers.  Exceedingly drinkable.

4362,"2005-01-17",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2007 2004 bottle from Heemer77, thanks!  Stupendously thick, rich, dark pour.  Looks almost like a nitrogen tap.  Viscous, creamy and has a perfectly formed, long-lasting oatmeal colored head.  Unfortunately, it seems to be rather filtered.  Smells of light milk chocolate, sweet toffee, anise, hints of oily roast and some slight yeastiness.  A dried out, dusty, almost ash-like note on the end of the nose, as well.  Flavor begins with a balanced mix of sweet and dry.  Youve got more oily roast as noted from the nose, mixing with a medium sweet caramel/toffee-like flavor.  Brown sugar, tons of creamy milky chocolate and then the coffee.  Its like a cup of dunkin donuts coffee, with a packet of sugar and some milk in it.  Slightly watery, not terribly challenging, but still pretty good.  Finishes with more brown sugar/brown malt appeal.  A touch on the sweet side overall, but the lager element serves to keep the beer from getting very heavy and adds a touch of crisp yeastiness on the finish.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Taste: warm mouthfeel, ample texture, giving, full of character, dark, yes, but a most companionable brew, slinks and sashays through the mouth, flirting with all the senses. Chocolate dabbles in, nuts flitter around like a social butterfly at play in the senses, and oh, so smooth. Resilient finish, stays solidly and happily on the palate. Wonderfully thick & tasty texture.
What I love about this beer is that you very easily forget that youre actually drinking a lager, for it is so full-bodied and flavorful, youd think you had a brown ale or a porter in your hands. Theres only the slightest bitterness, but the flavor looms so huge...sassafras? sasparilla? anise? molasses?...that it ranks high on drinkability.

4362,"2004-05-12",3.4,"My first schwarzbeer. Its interesting because I was surprised by an initial dryness I dont normally associate with lagers. The dryness made me think this tastes much like a porter or stout but halfway through the glass a malt sweetness comes to the fore. The malt is definitely very German-like, which, to my taste, seems a little foreign to the stout-like dryness. A lot of roast coffee, some faint caramel, in both aroma and taste. The color is interesting, too--looks like a heavy stout from the side looks more translucent and ruby-brown when you look down into the glass as you drink. I poured this into a glass from Germany, an 0.4l tulip with a logo fro Alpirsbacher Klosterbrau Pilsner aus dem Schwarzwal. The head was big and rose about two inches above the rastal line and subsided rather quickly as I drank, leaving almost no lace or residual foam on the beer.

Medium bodied, roastiness lingers but isn't overpowering on the backend.

4362,"2004-01-11",4.1,"Maybe the best dark lager I've had in years. Nearly black with a thick head and excellent retention. Aroma is of roasted malt with a smokiness in the background.

4362,"2003-12-28",3.8,"Dark reddish brown hue with small tan head and some lace. The aroma hinted of toasted pumpernickel bread, light molasses, caramel, aromatic and noble hops. ripe apples, sweet spices, and smoke. The taste starts with a mocha malt and earthy yeast notes. Has an undertone of acidic fruits and mild bitterness. The finish provides more flavor profiles of smoke and coffee. The mouthfeel is lively and slightly metallic, dry and crisp.

I couldn't make out my Flavor and Palate ratings but they should be accurate within one point. Rich milk chocolate aroma. Deep ruby reddish brown color with large, small-bubble, light brown head. Excellent lace. Knowing that Oakes had touted this one highly, I was eager to try it. It didn't dissapoint.

4362,"2003-12-10",4.0,"Draft. Among the pale pilseners at the downtown Chicago Kristkindl market is a keg of pale pilsener's evil twin. Pours with a hearty brown head over a body that looks solid black in a plastic cup, then shows brown highlights as I drink it. Kind of a black bread smell thats not as prominent as a stout. Definite dark roast malts against a German hop profile. Leaves a taste at the back of the palate where bitterness and astingency are detected. Roast coffee taste, perhaps a note of pear, subdued by its ""clean"" lager finish. Brings up a bit of a burnt toast taste toward the end that may not be to everyone's liking, but I like its complexity.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

Bottled: 12/12/02    Hot damn, this puppy pours beautifully! A rich dark brown body with edges of crimson, the head is an enormous mound of toffee cushion.   The aroma and flavors are full and malty, although very earthy as well, nose of warm peat fields, carrot juice, stewed roast beef – peppercorns & cabbage, thick roasted barley, hints of chocolate. This may sound disgusting, but truth be told, it is a rather surprisingly tasty and enjoyable Black Beer! Thanks for the surprise Mike!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

Aroma is actually a bit on the hoppy side, hint of vegetation over malt sweetness.  Its been far too many years since I tasted one of these.  Flavor is of smooth chocoaltes, a hint of caramel, and a drying hoppy finish, a bit spicy and earthy.  Quaffable and wonderful.  Why does Sprecher taunt me by sending root beer to Virginia but not their high octane stuff?  RERATE:  Slightly stunned to find this on tap at Commercial.  Tasting notes the same! Rating the same!

What appears to be black is actually dark brown with garnet highlights.  Clarity is about as good as its going to get with a brew this dark.  Creamy tan head that leaves good lacing.  The aroma is quite subdued, but I detect some coffee, caramel, and earthiness.  The flavor is extremely smooth, with more earthy flavor than anything else.  Theres some coffee, chocolate, caramel, and faint hop, but they take a backseat to the rustic malt richness.  Finishes like it began, along with a hint of licorice.  Medium in body, with a soothing dryness and slight acidity on the tail end.  A top-notch Schwarzbier!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MarkR"

Nose is deeply malt with hints of toasted grain, somewhat sweet a real treat to the senses. The start is malt-laden and ambrosial with the top intermediate in its feel to the palate.

An inch high tan head of loose bubbly spongyness grew fast but faded nearly just as fast to a thin ring and minimal spotty lace. 

Nose is roasty malts, slightly tangy of dark fruits and molasses with a touch of chocolate and light mustyness.

Has a complex mix of malts with alot of roastyness, has a bit of caramel and molasses, a very light touch of chocolate and very mild bitterness, quite smooth the whole way through. Some slight dark fruity tangyness and a smokey burntness pokes through close to the finish. Very subtle and well layered in its complexity.

4362,"2003-06-04",4.0,"Poured out of bottle, bought at Sam's Wine & Spirits in Chicago, 6/3/03.  Light tan, tight head dissipates quickly.  Very dark reddish-brown color-- almost totally opaque, but nice-looking.  Nose is of a dark roasted malt, with some scent of springy berries-- almost like a sweet or even an imperial stout.  First taste is a dark roast, again malty with some tingly fruitiness.  Pleasant undertaste of caramel too, with all of the chocolate and dark coffee of, again, a fine imperial stout.  Medium-light body, surprisingly thin for as strong as the nose and flavor are, but surprisingly long finish (roast all the way, almost burnt flavor, with some nice nuttiness that creeps through) for as thin as it feels in the mouth.  This stuff goes down extremely smooth, but somehow lingers for a very long time.  Alcohol flavor is there a bit, but is not off-putting.  Flavor brightens up strongly as you work through a bottle (and as it warms up a bit).  Very welcome addition to the lager canon.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

There is and initial bitterness that is quite forceful, more of an ESB bitter than an overhopped bitter as this retains its creaminess throughout.

4362,"2002-07-05",3.0,"I am not a big stout beer fan and that is what this stuff atsed like. But  it was good, dont get me wrong.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","greystreet80"
4362,"2002-06-25",4.2,"Has a mild, malty aroma wafting off its pitch black body. Flavor is light but complex, dominated by roasty, chocolatey malt flavors and the flavors of good pumpernickel bread.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
4362,"2002-06-17",3.9,"Excellent black beer.  I really love this style, though its hard to come across good examples of it.  I would certainly recommend this one.","Seattle, Washington, USA","tourette"
4362,"2002-05-11",3.3,"Lager, porter, stout, beer of some sort.  I know its a lager, but it had me confused.  Very porter-like in appearance and taste.  Coffee taste is prevelent but not overwhelming.  Lots of malt in this one.  I liked it.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","proc"
4362,"2002-05-08",3.7,"Overrated.  Has anyone actually tasted this beer? Its way too malty to drink more than one.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
4362,"2002-05-02",3.1,"Strong mocha/coffee aroma, slightly hoppy.  Flavors are a touch artificial to me, and moderately cloying.  Nonetheless, very drinkable.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
4362,"2002-04-28",3.7,"I really like the malty flavor in this one.  Distinctly German tasting.  The mixture of chocolate and caramel flavors is superb.  Very drinkable.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","MikeF"
4362,"2002-04-24",3.0,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2008 Big frothy head, strong malt taste and aftertaste.  Very smooth and drinkable for a dark thick beer.  
Re-rate 5-23-08: This beer is sadly a shadow of its former self. Much thinner and less flavorful than I remember. Too bad they had to ruin such a good thing. I am actually afraid to try the Special Amber again!","Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, USA","kmeves"
4362,"2002-04-03",3.8,"I had this beer at the Sprecher brewery about six years ago and took four bottles back to Minneapolis to savor.  My rating is based on faulty memory.  I remember it being rich and malty, without being overly sweet. I remember it as being nearly the best that I tasted at Sprecher .","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","jennythenipper"
4362,"2002-03-13",4.1,"Yes, one of Sprechers best.  Its to bad they changed the recipe a few years ago.  It was even better then.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

4362,"2002-03-03",3.7,"Basically exactly what I expected...strong caramel/chocolate malt flavor but a thin body. Smooth but too thin to be a clasic in my book.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"

4362,"2002-02-08",4.7,"Sprechers best... and near World Class. Bracing and soothing at the same time. The maltiness is amazing, the aroma like toast. The real strong stuff.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","johnnymilwaukee99"

4362,"2001-11-11",5.0,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2005 Ive had this on tap and in a bottle, and I really enjoy drinking it. This beer joins a list of brews which, I feel, need no improvement whatsoever. Thus, a perfect score. On tap this is just a fabulous quaf. It has a creamy, smoky richness that makes a luscious dessert.","Hancock, Michigan, USA","bipolar1"
4362,"2001-10-27",3.9,"This is my first Sprecher aside from thier excelent Root Beer. Very nice and suprisingly subtle. Malty with a burnt but not burned chocalate taste. As a hop head I would like a bit more though it would not fit the style. Fun beer.","Mt.Prospect, Illinois, USA","Drew Blood"
4362,"2001-10-21",4.0,"Finally found a store in Michigan that stocks Wisconsin micros (Oliver Ts in Grand Blanc).  As a result, I can rate beers that my palate only distantly remembers from the years I lived in Dairyland.  This is the main treat, a rich malty brew with a smoky edge.  It fades to sweerness as you go , and that to me, is a bit of a drawback, but its a hell of a beer.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"

4362,"2001-05-22",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2005 Absolutely beautiful...what else to expect from a top-notch Milwaukee microbrewer?  Aroma is a spicy chocolate scent.  The flavor is a sharp, tangy carmel that dissolves into a thick malty finish.  Well done indeed.","Wisconsin, USA","Got Stout?"
