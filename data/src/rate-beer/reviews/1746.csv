1746,"2016-07-27",3.5,"On tap at SLL tasting. Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a fizzy thick foam head. Aroma has some nice hop grassy citrus, earthy oak, doughy malt and a touch of fruity esters from the yeast. Big flavors follow the nose nicely with a really nice balanced palate of fresh oak, vanilla, toast, grass, and apricot.","Lewes, Delaware, USA","ROGUE"
1746,"2014-03-14",4.3,"2013 bottle, unoaked drunk 3/14/14Light amber body still shows a touch of haze despite leaving it in the fridge for a week.  Light beige head is full, fluffy and retained strongly down to the last drop.""Cisco character"" in the nose, somewhat tough to describe but its a bit rustic and lightly earthy.  Medium mats in the nose show very light caramel and dry brown bread while the spicy hoppiness is fresh, quite bitter and seems to remind me of strisselspalt or something along those lines. As clean as possible with a medium-high strength of aroma.Dry, but not grainy malts in the mouth provide light caramel, bread and just a touch of toastiness that segues in to a bitter, somewhat grassy hop spiciness that balances the malt perfectly and adds just enough flavor and bitterness without disrupting drinkability.Very tight, engaging carbonation for a lager (bottle conditioned lagers are pretty phenomenal when they are done well) and the supple maltiness makes for a perfect texture; refreshing yet full in the mouth. Bitterness dries things and clears the palate, leaving herbal spiciness, dry hay and grass and light black pepper. Clean again in the flavor, and no alcohol noted. Exceptional. One of the better lagers Ive had in a while and its so refreshing to see them do a more traditional take on the style instead of an IPL or Sour lager or Brett dunkel or Imperial Pilsner. Cheers to Cisco, these guys are really cementing themselves as the one of the best in New England. Very adept at brewing many different styles well.As an addendum, I can certainly see how the oak would bring this beer down.  Hopefully we can get Ernest and TAR a bottle of the unoaked stuff.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1746,"2014-02-26",3.4,"Clear brilliant darker golden under a thick foamy white head. The aroma has a pleasant grassy fresh hop tone with a kiss of pine and a backing biscuity malt (english muffin?). Smooth and somewhat perfumey flavor with some lavendar and hibiscus flowery potpourri notes. Finishes a bit grassy and bitter. Not my thing.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

1746,"2012-12-28",3.7,"Particulate-flecked rufous. Voluminous pasty white head exhibits excellent retention. Very delicate and refined malt aromas of honey-drizzled toast, candied pecans and piecrust along with a subdued whiff of honeysuckle, apricot and kumquat from the hops. Natural, expressive carbonation. Assertive coconut and a feisty phenolic burst precede a deeply succulent fusion of lightly candied nut-tinged malt and palate-lapping nectar-splashed apricots. Gorgeously structured malt unravels at a very unforced pace as it gracefully unleashes its finespun yet multidimensional crisp nuttiness and dextrinous girth across the tongue. Some piecrust grittiness in there as well to coincide with the obligatory snap of minerals. Aside from the raw oak character which is chockfull of sappy sugars,  the sweetness is managed by the clean attenuation and polished, well-detailed malt. Cleanly attenuated to the point of being ""airy"", yet far from hollow. Crisp as well, with a cornucopia of tropical notes spawning an appetizing acidity to mirror the spicy kumquat bitterness. Bouncy, depth-lending hay-dust maltiness teases the palate in the finish, while vanillin oak and hop acids exert themselves alongside. A terrific lager despite the unnecessary oak treatment which adds mostly sugar and little else of intrigue. Rock solid.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Cisco made this???  Wow.  Ive had five other brews from this place and they mostly score in the 2s for me.  How, then, have they made a solid (albeit overly oaky) strong lager?  The hops are bright and enticing, the head is creamy and lasting, its bottle conditioned, its wonderfully balanced, its clean...I can hardly believe what my nose and mouth are telling me, but if you want evidence that Im not a biased reviewer, here is a perfect example...I fully expected this to be a drain pour.  The only thing I dont like is the wood aging.  This would probably be a 4+ if they hadnt oaked it...smells like they used chips since its pretty raw smelling but no matter what technique they used, oak and a bright golden lager just dont go together well...they are clashing characters, not complementary ones.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
