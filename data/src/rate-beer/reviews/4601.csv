4601,"2017-06-12",3.9,"750ml bottle no date.Pour hazy neon green, the lower it get to the bottom of the bottle less neon it is. Small non lasting white head. Is the green color due to the herbs used in that brew or it got help by colorant ? Mr. Prignon wont tell his secrets.Aroma of Basil, Mint and notes of wheat.Taste is herbal, basil, wheat and notes of mint.Medium body and carbonation for the style (Witbier/Saison). Refreshing and high drinkability.Weird, beautiful, audacious, funny, wonderful and perfectly well done beer. Thumbs up Mr. Prignon...","Quebec, CANADA","Arcanor"
4601,"2017-06-11",3.5,"750mL bottle. Pours a hazy, earthy green with almost no head. Aroma is bitter and a little funky; grass, some lime, herbs/vegetation, yeast, clove, spice, and pepper. Taste is tart lime, kiwi, melon, light funk, spice, pepper, and bitter grass. Lightly tart up front before a spicy, somewhat bitter finish. Light-medium body. Moderate carbonation. Smooth, slick mouthfeel.","Massachusetts, USA","tapefuzz"
4601,"2017-05-24",3.4,"Bottle. Hazy to murky green with a medium sized light green head with good retention, lace and regeneration. Mint, eucalyptus, green tea, hay, flowers and bubblegum in the nose. The flavour starts sweet followed by notes of dust, light white bread, green tea, mint and light eucalyptus. Fairly sweet throughout.","DENMARK","SlackerMads"
4601,"2017-05-23",4.0,"75cl bottle via Roybeer. It pours a murky green-ish color with a minimal bubbly white head.
Aroma is funky and tangy with notes of lemon peel, lemon juice, kiwi fruit, melon and basil. Taste is also tangy funky slightly acidic with more notes of lemon peel, grass, pineapple, kiwi fruit and basil. Medium bodied with ok carbonation. Overall, best Fantome in a long time","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"
4601,"2017-05-20",3.3,"The Sovereign DC: pours greenish with a white head. Aroma is limey, funky, and sort of ambigiously fruity. Taste is sweet and lightly funky. Somewhat lingering aftertaste. Not bad, but not impressive.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
4601,"2017-05-03",3.5,"Pours soupy bile into a tulip. Soapy head with little retention recedes to hug rim. Tart lemon/lime aromas. Soft with aspirin and mildly, tart kiwi upfront turning to bitter earth and leaves in the lasting finish. Tastes better than it looks...","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
4601,"2017-04-10",3.7,"Degustata alla spina. Ottimo laspetto sebbene inquietante come da tradizione. Verde alga e torbido. Schiuma persistente. In bocca subito cedro e mandarino. Aroma più dolce del sapore, sentori di camomilla. Finale meno citrico e più dolce anche se finalissimo è sullamaro. Corpo medio. Ottima scelta dallolfatto fino al gusto e anche al retrogusto.","ITALY","Akiro"
4601,"2017-02-19",3.8,"Sampled a four oz pour at Mikkeller downtown LA. 

Pours ugly greenish brown with a tall head and above average lacing and retention (for a Fantome). Aroma is the classic Fantome bready barnyard with only a minor touch of plastic. Flavor is grassy and peppery with the bread, banana, and mouthfeel that Ive come to expect. Plastic is missing luckily. 

Glad this was remade. Got to tick one that I assumed Id never see I get ahold of...","Do Not Resuscitate, California, USA","t0rin0"
4601,"2017-02-15",3.9,"(En fût à Bottlecraft Little Italy): Concombre, lime, blé, estragon, minéraux et une tendre moellesse. Hautement digeste.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
4601,"2016-12-18",3.7,"I got this at Mikkeller Bar San Francisco. It was 8 abv and not the 5 it says here, so I guess its different brew, but I will rate it here anyway. It has a really interesting color: grey/green with nice small white head. Actually looks nice though it might not sounds so. Aroma is quite subtle. Has some cucumber, apple and coriander notes and a little tartness to it. The taste is quite sweet but not overly. Lots of apple and pear flavors and vaguely tart. Very dry finish. Not much bitterness.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Brewhemia"
4601,"2016-12-17",4.0,"Not nearly as green as the pic on RateBeer. Had on tap at Mikkeller Bar San Francisco. Tart and light with possible woodruff for flavoring (what else could have made it green?). Possible grapefruit notes. Fantastic!","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
4601,"2011-07-18",3.9,"Draft @ 9th Rencontre des Brasseries du Luxembourg Belge. Brewed just for this festival, base beer is the regular Fantôme with the brewers secret ingredient.
Couleur est comme son nom lindique, verte opaque avec une très belle mousse blanche. Nez est fruité allant sur la feuille de thé verte, menthe.
En bouche, une bière naturelle, blanche avec tout le savoir de chez Fantôme. Palais épais de froment, note de citron. Ingrédient spécial rappelant la feuille de thé (matcha?), citronnelle, menthe ou eucalyptus. Une fine amertume se dégage sur la fin et laisse dans le fond du verre une trace de feuille bouillie. Cest bon, léger, surprenant, et on en redemande, dailleurs ce que jai fait en buvant plusieurs verres.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
