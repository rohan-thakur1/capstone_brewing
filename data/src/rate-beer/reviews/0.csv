0,"2016-03-10",4.7,"From notes. 750 mL bottle shared by Doug at his humble abode on March 07. This one was enjoyed with dinner (marinated and barbecued pork loin). Thanks Doug! The pour is a cloudy bright yellow color with a nice thick pure white head that slowly falls, leaving a few legs of really good lace. The aroma is fantastic. There is a beautiful dank fruitiness to this right up front. Pineapple, citrus, and a tropical blend really pop. There is a distinct Nelson hoppiness thats followed up by the citrus peel and a distinct coriander. Im not crazy about it, but it fits in with the beer very, very well. The flavor is just as awesome. There are very similar profiles of fruitiness, the Nelson hops, down to the citrus peel and coriander. There is a little more of a spiciness on the very back, but I dont mind. This is lightly sour and tart as you drink it as well. Fantastic. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a bright sharp carbonation and a lingeringly sour fruity aftertaste with just a hint of spiciness. This really is an excellent beer. Love me some de Garde.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

0,"2015-09-25",4.3,"Dégustée ne compagnie de David-Samuel. Couleur paille et mousseuse au service, la bière perd instantanément cette mousse si alléchante ne laissant rien sur mon verre. Le style est curieusement mal respecté, en ce sens que je ne sens aucun sel, ni au nez ni en bouche. Le dry-hop apporte une touche citronnée importante, limite chlorée et sulfureuse qui percute mes papilles en milieu de palais. Cest fruité, acide, frais, léger et autoritaire. Sans aucun arrière-goût, cette bière est dun trop grande facilité à boire. Un coup de coeur énorme en cette soirée de dégustation!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

Aroma is great with a moderate citrus note and light coriander. Light citrus notes. The hops add a ton of character with lots of melon, passion fruit, peach and kiwi. Really fruity, but it blows off a bit. 
Pours a hazy, yellow gold with a big, fairly thick, white head that exhibits really good retention. Moderate lacing with no legs. 
Flavor has a medium light acidity with a moderate citrus note, mostly orange, mandarin and lemon-lime. Light coriander with a nice saltiness. Les shop character in the flavor and low bitterness. Light melon, kiwi and passion fruit. 
Mouthfeel is light bodied, but not watery with medium high to high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth.
