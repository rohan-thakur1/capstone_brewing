1580,"2013-12-29",2.9,"Sampled from a 750 ml bottle this sake poured a pale milky color. Only a mild level of viscosity with lots of particulates left behind. The aroma is creamed rice and a hint of perfume. The flavor has a pronounced alcohol bite with noted astringency followed by rice, vodka, soap, perfume and a hint of pepper. Medium length finish of astringent alcohol and rice. Medium bodied though slick in a way that seems watery. Ok.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"

1580,"2013-02-16",1.8,"Not sure why Im going so hard against the grain again with this particular brand, but I couldnt stand this nigori. The appearance was off...almost like the milky rice particles were too large and kept falling out of slurry. It didnt look creamy for more than 30 seconds. The taste was like a sweeter version of Tozais Living Jewel, which I didnt like because it reminded me of a cleaning fluid with an artificial lemon scent. The palate was too thin for a nigori. Instead of making the palate creamy, the unfiltered rice powder kept feeling like rice flakes that formed a mush and made my teeth try stick together. Probably the worst sake Ive had excluding futsu shu style.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","Inebelation"

1580,"2011-07-05",3.5,"Bottle. Very cloudy with noticeable deposit on the glass -- this is nigori with an attitude.  Nose is Asian pair, apple, and a light lactic edge. Flavor is subdued and rich, well-integrated with a slight sweetness. Finishes long and warm. A good sake in a good style.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"
1580,"2010-02-08",3.3,"looks like skim milk with little rice chunks floating in it.... horchata perhaps. either way it sludges up the side of the glass.

lots of koji in the nose... along with spicy alcohol, chalky minerals, rice, florals, moist earth (more koji notes?) and distinct cantaloupe. 

the palate is a little too sweet for me to thoroughly enjoy... though not terribly so... it also hides the alcohol fairly well (as it is only felt as it warms the chest). there is a fruity tartness throughout which reminds me of cucumbers and honeydew... sort of a strange battle between sweet and sour im not sure that im fond of. other flavors of rice water, florals, a touch of milkiness and some must fill it out. 

the mouth feel is gritty with unfiltered bits making the medium body seem fuller than it is. mixed with the acidity, the thickness is rather annoying and unpleasant. 7/4/6/3/13/3.3","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"
1580,"2009-10-04",2.6,"Bottle: Pours a milky white color with smaller particles and thin legs. The nose is musky with some dry concrete and mineral notes; abundant alcohol and a very dry light banana hint. The flavor has a large impact, but it comes off more minerally and lightly fruity, the alcohol is hidden fairly well as its a bit sweet in the mouthfeel. A subtle brief tail with a more prominent acidic finish. As a general non-fan of nigoris, this is no exception.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"

1580,"2009-09-20",3.8,"This bottled sake from a restaurant poured no and left behind a hazy with fine particulate white colored body and a lacing with particulate in it.

1580,"2009-08-09",3.0,"Bottle.  Milky white pour, thick particles sticking to the sides of the glass. Nose is mild banana and cream, some milky pear, some herbs and some strange sort of pineapple character.  First few sips are full, chewy and then gritty on the back, punctuated by an incredibly unpleasant bite as it is swallowed.  Harsh and husky rice, more banana, pear, green apple, some creamy vanilla ice cream but also some sour lactic notes.  The unpleasant bite subsides and nearly disappears towards the bottom of the glass.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1580,"2009-07-25",3.5,"11/14/2007:  Tozai Snow Maiden was served chilled.  It looks like Gatorade Frost (watery white color and cloudy).  There is some fine grit on the glass that makes the glass look speckled/frosted.  The moderately strong aroma contains alcohol, almond, honeydew melon, green apple, and slight vanilla.  The alcohol is a bit astringent, but I guess thats to be expected when the content is right around 15%!  Anyways, the flavor is lightly sweet with some fruitiness in the front (apple) and hints of coconut.  The finish is moderately long and warming with a slight alcohol burn.  Since this sake is unfiltered, it has some particales in its medium-full, creamy body.  I really enjoyed this sake overall
720 ml pink, twist-off capped bottle (14.9% ABV) shared by Tmoney99.  Thanks Tom!  Rating #27 for this sake.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

1580,"2009-06-07",3.5,"Looks like skimmed non-fat milk when poured into glass. Somewhat sweet scent. Not huge. Heavy alcohol flavor (15% after all) that reminds me of a vodka or well filtered single-malt whisky. Perha[ps a little coconut to it. Thick body due to rice stuff thats included. White flecks coat the side of the glass when you put it down. Light sweetness lingering on the palate a minute or two after drinking it.  Tried it so as to say Ive tried some of the sake list here, but wont go out of my way to drink it again unless its at some sushi restaurant.

ADDENDUM: Let the sake warm up a little while I wrote the review above. The huge alcohol kick is a bit more muted now that its warmed up.","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"

Flavor is fairly sweetish and milky along with fermented rice and alcohol. Bit of a chalky antacid quality that detracted.

Milky, opaque/opalescent in color, still with a fair amount of chalky residue in the glass...aroma is of overripe pears, a touch of vanilla, cherry blossoms and bubblegum, quite sweet but inviting and complex....thick, milk-shake like texture to the body, sweet and sugary at first but alcohol hardness does creep in a bit....touches of white chocolate along with a ripe/cooked fruit sugariness slowly fade into a drier grainy character at the end....alcohol becomes somewhat strong but never really problematic as it warms; this was definitely best when very cold.
