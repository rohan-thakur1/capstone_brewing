3103,"2016-11-17",4.1,"Deep heavy dark Amber with a large fluffy ivory head that lasts forever and leaves great lace. Nice roasty campfire smokey nose with a certain dark maltiness thats roasty sweet but not smokey. Interesting. Crisp and dark malty flavor thats a little campfire-ish but also dark malty sweet with a touch of raisin and plum, then the gently smokey tone comes back to calm it down. Brilliantly full but quaffable, smokey yet interesting enough to not be a one trick poney.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
3103,"2016-10-05",4.0,"On tap at Star Bar. This is a deep, deep brown with a pervasive khaki head. Aroma has fruity yeast notes with brown sugar and smoked meat. The palate is full and creamy. Very nice meaty, smoky undertones throughout the flavor. Its a sweet beer, for sure but it works. Hints of brown sugar, cola, no real hop character, and wood smoke. I cant say Ive had a smoked beer quite like this one and I definitely like it. I could stand it to be less sweet, but its delicious as it is.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
3103,"2016-09-28",3.4,"Tap at hopcat. Aroma is smoked meat with mild brown sugar and caramel. Tastes like a mix of a smoked beer and a barleywine. The sweet caramel malt overpowers the smoke a bit. Its not bad but Im not a big fan of the combo.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"

3103,"2015-10-30",3.7,"12 oz bottle shared with Jason and Brian. The pour is a foggy brown color with a single spot of head and no lacing. The aroma is really smokey. There is a nice bacon aspect to it. It's got a nice malt underneath but the smoke controls. The flavor is much more malty with the smoke on the back end. Light bacon and a strong camp fire on the way back. Not crazy, not overly done but just enough. The mouth feel is light and slick with a decent carbonation but it falls flat. The aftertaste is lingeringly malty and smokey. Pretty good

Aromas are decent smokiness, biscuit, cherry wood. A decent saltiness and cured meats. Initial is fairly smokey and salty, a good biscuty malt with toffee, malty sweetness anf cherry wood and smokey meat smoke. Not bad, a decent oxidation sends it for the worse and a touch of bandaids follows through. A touch of biscuity mellow, Ok, the smoke is still bringing the power, but the beer itself appears to be past its peak.

It finishes slightly sour/tart with some alcoholic warming. Thin to medium body, watery texture and little carbonation. Reading posts from 2002, many found this beer to be overly sweet and I did not see any mention funkiness.

3103,"2008-12-09",3.8,"Bottle.  Obviously, I am pretty excited about this.  Not every day you get to try a 6 year old bottle of something special.  I have been putting this off for a while, kind of like I did not want to ruin the occasion or have a big let down.  A slight hiss as the cap is removed lets me know it has not gone completely bad and is a little reassuring.  Bottle releases a cloudy brown liquid with very little head and sweet brown sugar and caramel aromas.  A little bit of oxidation is noticeable and I hope it will not ruin things.  I’m guessing this is a shadow of its former self after 6 years, but it still has a pretty good brown sugar and caramel malt presence with quite a bit of dark fruit to make it interesting.  A little bit of tartness and a little bit of a salty smokiness are present, but seem to have faded.

Received this gem from tangfoot. Thanks again Fred. 

Appearance: This pour a reddish brown with very little head. There is very little lacing on this, but it looks pretty good based on its age..

Aroma: Starts with some smokey and sweet malts. Kind of reminds me of breakfast sausage with maple syrup. In the background is some dark fruits. As this warms, there is a little sourness, which I enjoy. 

Flavor: There is mostly smokey notes in the beginning. When this warms, some of the sweet dark fruit flavors come to play. I wonder what this tasted like fresh. 

Palate: The smokey and sweet malt flavors hang around for a while. This is kind of thin, which I expected due to its age.  This goes down pretty smooth, especially after it warms for a bit. I could drink a few of these, but Im glad Im getting to try any of this at all.

Overall: This is very unique and interesting beer. Cant think of any others Ive had like it. Im curious the age of this one too. This was my least favorite of the Batches 4000 - 8000, but its still pretty damn good and unique. If you see this or can try this, go for it, Im sure youll enjoy it.

3103,"2008-01-12",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 13, 2008 Poured from a 12 oz. bottle.  Rich, dark caramel color and an oily textured pour.  Earthy, wet smoke aroma of white meat and spruce tips in the bonfire; the visceral outdoor experience.  Tangy beechwood flavor, with bursts of orange and peach in a zesty marinade glazing the meats.  Subtle hints of chocolate linger underneath with turbinado and burnt brown sugars.  Viscous in the mouth; well aged and still full of life.  Lasting finish of sweet, caressing pipe tobacco smoke.  Brilliant; even this small pour yielded such massive flavor.  Thanks for sharing, Zac!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Then it was like I walked into a smoke house with a bit of fruit.  There was some soy sauce saltiness as well.  The flavor was rich, bold, but smooth smoke.  There was a underlying toffee sweetness.  Full body.  Medium carbonation.  Smoke dryness, and malt sweetness.  Very rich.  It was really a smoke bomb, but sooooo easy to drink.  Mike has been overly generouse many times.

I was surprised to hear a pretty loud hiss when I opened it. Aroma is of sweet smoked meats, rich malt, very pleasant and complex. Flavor has a nice and light smoked meat flavor - not overdone and seemed to flow very smoothly and evenly in the mouth. The smoke adds a nice little touch near the end of each sip. This is a perfect cigar beer. 9%? I never noticed. After opening one up five and half years after being bottled, I think this could go for a few more years and still be quite enjoyable.

3103,"2007-05-07",4.2,"Sampled in October 2004. Very dark sorrel pour, cloudy and dense. Thin beige head rises up and fully recedes quickly, minimal lacing left in its wake. Aroma is reminiscent of Bamberg, heavily smoked and malty. Light pepper infiltrates the senses. Flavor is much the same, heavy malt and thick smoke, lightly sweet and vinous as well. Fruits such as raspberries and peaches make their mark. An odd smoke beer that seems to comprise the loveliest traits of both traditional German brewing and trademark expertise so often showcased by Bells. Bitterness is kept at a minimum. The taste yields more sweetness than the nose near the finish. Palate is smooth and lightly carbonated. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Finishes rich and sweet, smoke lingering. Very good.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

It didnt get a higher score simply because everything was so mild. Nothing really jumped up and grabbed me.

3103,"2006-12-21",4.8,"Enormous thanks to Dave for this one! Semi-translucent and cherry-amber in color with slowly responding, pinpointed lace. Best aroma ever. Hickory, and smoked applewood get smothered in caramel goop. Shingles and tar are knowingly entrenched in a caramelized nut sauce. Almonds and pistachios are left toasting overnight to the persistent campfire. Thanks be to heaven for the alluring, enflamed maple vats. Flavor freely fulfills the aromatic promise. Sweet maple syrup and fudge meet in the middle with smoke-filled almond shells avec sooty nuts. Savoring the sips, the wood flamed oak bark and oats take precedent above the myriad of beautiful contributors. Enamored with the maple bark, broiled toffee kicks in and is joined soon thereafter by café au lait, with liquid smoke added in place of flavoring syrup. Chewy toffee, brazed caramel sauce and planks of maple laid down over flame bring a finish that couldnt be any more blessed.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

I dont know where this came from, but it was a nice surprise.  I only got a small sample unfortunately but I could easily have shared a half bottle with someone.  The taste was a bit unusual so I can see how some people might hate it.  Still, it is a nice change from the sour beers of earlier in the night.
Aroma / Appearance - Scents of hot sugar cured ham and used oil wafted out of the glass.  It was sort of like Christmas dinner, if you held it at the local mechanics.  The body was a caramel brown with no lacing or head.
Flavor / Palate - The initial sip was sweet and smoky.  It reminded me of drinking a flat Dr Pepper in a smoke filled bar.  If this were available again Id buy a sixer for sure.  The all too brief sample was enjoyable, fun and easy to drink.  The finish was a little hot but it complemented the other characteristics well.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Aroma is an interesting combonation of campfire smoke with light oxidation notes of sherry and moderate alcohol.  Some hefty maltiness going on here as well.  The smoke is heavy and spot on after all this time still.  Below that an almost aged barleywine like base rests comfortably.  Lots of sherry and cardboard notes on the finish.

The colour was a very dark brown with a bit of dark red. There was very littl ehead after being poured, but there was a persistant ring around the edges with some lacing in the middle. Incredibly meaty flavour with tons of finely tuned smoke and sweet malts. Caramel flavours are rampant, but subdued and not overpowering. The smoke flavours reminds me of hickory or oak chips smoking some salmon on the grill, there is a certian essence of wood present in the flavour, but not like a barrel aged version.

This over a medly of aged fruits and malt. Over a stong ale? Wow! Has greasy meat and salmon touches, that are not unpleasent. Flavors are quite savory at first, with a hint of gentle garlic and dill, mingled with smoked salmon fat. Strong fruit and cherries kick in, much like a classic dark strong belgian.  But, it continues with an underlying gentle and delicate smoked pork fat. Accompanies the gentle malt, fruit and apples with grace. Bright and well presented to the palate.  The deft mingling of gentle campfire and pork fat dance with caramel and toffee in a graceful manner and overall harmony. Im really impressed by how well the two disparate flavors intermingle so well. This is truly a special treat. Signs of mellowing and gentle and fantastic ageing are true in the ale side of this beer. A hint of cranberry vinous notes in the backend. In the aftertaste the smoked woodchips mix with a gentle bread and yeast. All around, fantastic! Palate is sweet and clingy, with an everlasting pleasant flavor that I wish would never end.

Almost could be mistaken for a Belgian Quadruple,  but without the trademark yeasty aromas.  Smells like delcious smoked salmon, and Im not saying that to be totally obvious with this impression.  The smoked meat aromas have a greasy, fatty quality to them that could not be found in a fish outside of the trout/salmon species.  Some red berry aromas lurk beneath the smokiness, but theyre difficult to discern over the smoky dominance.  Wow.  Im very impressed by the level of balance between the different flavor elements.  Its almost like drinking a smoked brown Belgian Strong Ale.  Sweet, vinous qualities.  Carbonation is mild and it tastes as though the beer has had ample time to mellow out and leave behind its sticky sweet flavor residues.  A bit of a honey smack at the conclusion.

3103,"2006-01-22",3.6,"(12 oz bottles: Obtained in trades with CaptainCougar and Eyedrinkale, thanks Tom and Mike!) I know this was bottled four years ago this month, but I have to admit to not being inspired to rave about this beer.  There are a few fairly prominent flavors that Im having a tough time overlooking, chief among these is the first impression of Band-Aids.  Also, oxidation seems to have had some effect, and the woodsy, earthy flavor is rather extreme in comparison to the other flavors.  The beer is generally sweet and fruity initially, but also gently tart for good balance there, with moderate bitterness and the pleasant smokiness setting in toward the finish, but this beer also seems oddly salty to me as well.  The nose is fairly earthy and woodsy, lightly sweet, but not really showing much smokiness.  Heavy, somewhat syrupy body, but enough anti-cloying aspects keep the beer from weighing down the palate.  Carbonation is light, as expected.  Very murky, ruddy, light brown color.  The light tan head barely caps the beer on the pour and quickly fades away into oblivion, leaving no lacing on the glass to prove its existence.  Still pretty enjoyable after all these years, but I have to think that this bottle was probably better a couple of years ago.  Right now, it just tastes like an aged, somewhat oxidized and earthy barley wine.  I have one more bottle of this, and Im thinking I probably wont wait too long to do my Bells Batch X,000 flight.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

3103,"2005-07-31",4.1,"7/31/05.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, shared with CaptainCougar on RateBeer in Escondido, CA 7/31/05.  Orange-brown, slightly hazy body.  Not much head but I love the color.  Aroma is sweet and cedary, with rounded maltiness and brown sugar, somewhat like wood chips for a fire.  Call it a smoked barleywine.  Color me impressed.  The flavor is somewhat meaty, tangy, sweet, surprisingly laced with a residual tobacco-y bitterness and some faint dark earthiness.  Some alcohol presence, and perhaps a bit too sweet (I can imagine this was overwhelmingly cloying in its initial release), but what a ride it is. . .  I think itll continue to get better, because the smoke profile continues to get more complexly integrated with the malts as the sugar rounds out.  Body is very oily, almost gelatinous, full and gentle.  Finish is long and hauntingly, sweetly smoky-- the subtle and complex caramelly smoked malts being the unifying component here-- rife with German malt notes and a woody, earthy character Ive never experienced before; sticky and wonderful.  A fantastic barley wine.  A fantastic smoked beer.  A wonderfully unique, fine, fine brew.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

Aroma is a calming smooth, tangly sweet smokey wood or fish thing over a small caramel malt. Quite tangy and sweet with the smokey thing thats not overly powerful but definately present. This aint no mild nose, even after some age. Impressive. 

Flavors are tangy and sweet with malt and smoke, plain and simple. Quite a good load of them. Smooth, not overbearing. Caramel underneath, some slight dark cherry and pruney flavors kinda play in there nearer the finish. Finishes a bit rough with some yeasty alcoholic spiced heat and smokey leftover tingey tang.

Feel isnt as smooth as the flavors, quite jagged and rough; though, nearly full with a solid malt base and smokey sweet tang keeping a whole bunch of things a goin on. Gets better as it warms. More so towards the finish, it starts out with a quick grab, settles in, then takes hold again. Uff-da, what a ride...

I had recently had the Viking Rauch and found that the palate really let it down, so I was very pleased at how well this kept life--not imposing, just pleasant, allowing the complexity to waft through the mouth.

Plums, raisins, leather, the earmarks of a strong barleywine, with that smoke flavor sitting firmly on top. A real champion, and another fantastic feat from Bell's. Definitely a sipping beer, for one cannot easily ingest these rough, but rewarding, flavors. Fruity, spicy, warming, smoky, that's the full bill! Alcohol kick comes in stronger at the end, and you have to wonder how they will celebrate batch 10,000.
Evaluating this beer is a tough call. A truly unique and well-made beer, but not a easy one to guzzle back, in the least. You can only have one at a time, and slowly, at the end of the night, not far from the bed...unless you're a masochist!

A very strong tobacco note, with a sweet, smoky thickness that singes my throat. I really did not know what to expect from this beer. Whatever my previous thoughts were, this is not it. I am caught so off gaurd by this beer. The alcohol is very noticeable. Taking MUCH smaller sips, some nice nutty chocolate notes shine through, with the smokiness still accenting everything. This beer has smoked tobacco, burnt wood, smoked plums, smoked nuts, and I think some smoked smoke in it. Even with all the smoke, there is still a powerful sweetness. The mouthfeel is very thick and almost syrupy. It sticks to the tongue a gradually oozes down the throat, leaving a trail of smoked sugar and a touch of bitterness lingering behind.

It is salty and meaty, yet retains a pleasant flavor and has the texture of moist beef jerky.  It then fades into some nice, but light hops and finishes clean and smooth.  Alcohol Very well masked, carbonation is minimal.  Beer has a wonderfully full complex body.  A pleasure to drink this.Sampled again 6/2005 at RBSG.  Still holding up spectacularly well.  Smooth, silky, chocolatey and plenty of salty, rich smoke.  Awesome beer that has really proved itself to me.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3103,"2003-07-27",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 28, 2007  RERATE, nearly 6 year old bottle I got in trade from Kan and shared with Tom. This shows very little oxidization and is still nicely smoked. Notes of marzipan, plum and tobacco along with the smoked wood than run throughout. +1 aroma and +1 flavor. Hazy orange brown hue with small white head which coats the glass. Nose is smoky for sure with touch of ripe fruit, caramel, and molasses. Vinous, barleywine like qualities. The taste grabs you quickly, major prune/fig flavors with an topping on smoke which is noticeable well after you drink it. A hop twang is available in the aftertaste. Chewy and full-bodied. Soft mouthfeel that has almost no sign of the alcohol level, NICE! Despite all the complex tastes, it was smooth and easy to drink. I enjoyed this more than the person who gave it to me as the RBSG, JSquire. Batch 6,000 is right around the corner, cant wait.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

I like smoked beers, but not this one.  Maybe its the smell, but it tastes greasy.  It is cloyingly sweet like mixing your pancake syrup with smoked canadian bacon for breakfast.

3103,"2002-10-20",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2006 October 2002:  Bottled, at the Map Room in Chicago.  Im among the yea-sayers on this one; a hugely malty, sweet, unbalanced behemoth of a smoked beer, its up there with the works of Brauerei Heller Trum and bears out the reputation of Kalamazoo.  Deep, deep red in color with almost no head; smokey aroma could be a little stronger at first, gets a bit more pronounced as it warms but also just a might too sweet even for me.  Flavor is smoke, licorice, caramel, cherries; smokiness thins a bit as it warms and a more barley-wine character takes over.  Not quite perfect, it may be a bit too syrupy and doesnt have much hop kick at all (not entirely sure it needs any though), but this is a worthy 2nd-tier effort from this brewer, which would make it first-rank for just about anyone else!  Go Map Room. 
January 2006:  12 oz bottle, cellar temperature.  Very little fizz when opened, not surprising...murky brown-black with just a tiny lasting dark ring of foam...balsamic vinegar/port wine quality in the nose at first, but this quiets down quickly and smoked meat takes over....still awesomely smooth, sweet, vastly smoky in the body, more chocolaty than before, oxidation is light and to my taste just about perfect...guessing this isnt going to improve but I dont think its gone much downhill yet.  Rating unchanged.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

I have a six pack in the fridge, and Ive only had one of them so far... wish i had gotten the expedition stout instead, but no... see, this is probably a good beer, it has quite a distinct flavor, aroma (yes, it really does smell like meat... which is odd) and full-blown smoked maltiness, with little hops. Good beer, but just not suited for my tastes... too forward in its intentions... not subtle enough, and the balance just isnt there. Why brew a smoked beer for your 5,000 batch? I just cant understand... expedition stout is next.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","slinkymello"
3103,"2002-09-22",3.7,"Really flat pour. Really rough pouring left a thin, ephemeral head. Big rich malty aroma wafts up as you pour though and is quite nice in its richness. The taste is mostly caramel, with some chocolate. Theres a mild fruitiness, some really, really faint coffee, present but not too strong smokiness. Mouthfeel was thick. Nice big flavor but perhaps a little too thick, rich and sweet to be easily drinkable. Has plenty of complexity, but its just the overly sweet nature that makes it a bit unpleasant.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
3103,"2002-09-16",3.2,"Light mahogany with a definite reddish tint.  Reminds me of cherry Juicy Juice (anyone?)  Smoked malt is prominent in the nose, but not in the manner of the Schlenkerlas.  I sense more of a grape juice aroma than a vinous one, coupled with oak and earth/dirt.  My first impressions are syrupy texture, smoke, and alcohol.  Youve got to take some time to adjust to this...its on a different plane than most beers.  Reminds me a little bit of a dopplebock, plus smoke, plus tannic astringency, plus salt, plus acedic acid, plus eucalyptus.  An intriguing and challenging beer.  I appreciate the quality, but this one never won me over.  At ~8 months old, it may be too young.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"

3103,"2002-09-02",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2007 Rerate 11/21/2004: This seems to have lost a bit since the last time I tried it.  Gained some butterscotch oxidized complexity, but lost some of the smokiness.  Still very rich and smooth and an awesome Rauchbier!

Rerate 4/7/2004: Aging this for two years has done great things!  Much more balanced and complex.  Great smooth, dense caramel sweetness with plenty of smoke.  Very robust and enjoyable.  This has aged wonderfully thus far.

9/2/2002: A very interesting combination.  Almost like a Paulaner Salvator Dopplebock with a hint of smoke.  Not nearly as smoky as the Aecht Schlenkerlas, but a strong interplay between the sweet malt and smoke brings out a variety of aromas.  Perhaps a bit too sweet and syrupy, but I bought a six pack so will be aging some and most likely re-rating.  I think the syrupy sweetness will mellow over time.

Starts with some intense smoke in the mouth.  As it moves through the middle to the finish, there is a lot of fruity sweetness coming through.  I'm just not sure about the style.

3103,"2002-05-21",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2003 Rated four months ago:  An  Imperial smoked strong ale, so says Larry Bell.  Aroma is of smoke, fruity malt, sausage, caramel, and whiffs of alcohol.  The first impression as this hits the tongue is smoke, followed by a slippery fruitiness from the blanket of malts, doughy yeastiness, tanginess which puckers the cheeks, and instant heat from the heavy alcohol.  The finish is perfectly balanced with smokiness leading the way and, again, fruity hints.  Indeed a most fruity example of the Smoked style.  I am not sure if this is a strong ale.  It definitely has the slippery mouthfeel, tangy bite, and fruity notes which the Old ale portrays but lacks any hop bitterness that is noticeable in most strong ales.  However, the spiciness may be more appropriate for the Smoked category.  Unarguably a world-class ale along with being a wonderful after-dinner sipper.  On the other hand, it would obviously pair so well with many dishes.  WHat we have here is a masterful creation with a very rare and underappreciated style.

3103,"2002-03-09",4.0,"Cold, the smokey flavor dominated.  However, when warmer it starts with a nice fruity flavor (with a subtle bitterness) and finishes smokey.  The smokeiness reminds me of Mezcal.  Very thick, moderate head. Let it warm up.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","MikeF"
3103,"2002-03-04",4.1,"This is a yummy, chewy ale.  Very thick and complex.  I really like it, though it certainly gets better as it warms.  Cold its alright, but at almost room temperature, its wonderful.  Quite a bit of alcohol too, as one of these gave me a pretty good buzz.","Seattle, Washington, USA","tourette"
3103,"2002-02-22",3.8,"Strong smoke smell and taste. It reminded me of smoked bacon. Thick syrupy texture. I picked up some salt. also. Strange. It gets better as it warms. An acquired taste for this one.","FLINT, Michigan, USA","pauliefrog99"
3103,"2002-02-17",2.8,"I was really looking forward to this, and I thought it was a dissapointment.  Very think, Im not sure it was even an Ale like it says on the bottle.  Had a hint of carmel in it but the thickness of this was just to much for me.","grand blanc, Michigan, USA","SpecialBrew99"
3103,"2002-02-10",4.3,"Bells Batch 5000 would make a wonderful dessert beer.   This ale poured  ruddy brown in colour and lacked signifigant carbonation.   I found the style to be similar to scotch ales--having that sweet caramel, apple flavor.    The body was thick and chewy.     This beer ended with sustained smokiness, mild bitter, and alcoholic warmth.   Very high end and interesting.   Excellent craftsmanship.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","lizziesage"
3103,"2001-04-10",3.9,"Very interesting style.  Deep dark red color, full-on aroma and taste.  Very much like an Old Ale, or a cross between that and a barleywine.  Fruity, complex.  Good late fall/early spring beer.  Extremely strong malty flavor.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
