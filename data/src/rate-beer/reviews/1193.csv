Excellent stuff Cloudwater & different enough from their DIPA v10 to avoid being repetitive. A great start with the fresh citrus & pine coming through, giving quite a bitter feel but one that was balanced & easy to drink. The tropical fruits that appeared from the middle on were great, the mango & apricot working well with the sweeter malts & the citrus adding a nice tang further along. While it was another excellent beer from the brewery, Im leaning more towards the DIPA v10 being the better of the two but its very close & Id happily try both again given the chance.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

Touch of mint leaf. Sweet vanilla malts. Bright, light, fresh hop leaf. Taste is soft, pulpy, citrusy bitter. Some peppery spice. Juicy mouthfeel. Completely mouthwatering. Juicy, lightly spicy bitter finish. Stupidly clean and easy drinking. Maybe the best one yet. Stunning.","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"

1193,"2017-01-19",4.1,"Bottle. Nose is very fruity, lychee, pineapple, peach, melon. Taste is fruity, mango, peach, pineapple, overripe mango, hint of cream, melon, very faint medicinal hop bite in the finish. Hazy, with a rich mouthfeel. Its a typically good, but I miss the bite of 10.","Greater Manchester, ENGLAND","Hanoi"
1193,"2017-01-19",4.5,"Bottle at home in tulip glass. Aroma is bursting with tropical fruit led by pineapple, mango and peach. Pours hazy orange, with a thin white head which doesnt last long. Taste follows the nose - packed with tropical fruits which is balanced with medium to strong bitterness. Rich mouthfeel. Overall, a banger. Loved it.","Norwich, Norfolk, ENGLAND","afitch"
