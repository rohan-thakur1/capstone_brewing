4083,"2015-12-29",3.6,"One year old lambic on tap at Holy Grale; had a few sips of this from my mate, Ryan. Aroma: Acidity rules out over lighter funk notes; some apple or lemon-like fruitiness hangs in there. Appearance: Clear, coppery yellow with streams of light carbonation holding up a skin of white head. Flavor: Acidity is not mouth-puckering, but its the most prevalent flavor here; fruit dries up a bit more and carries through to the finish, which still holds a good amount of tartness. Palate: Light body, slick texture, soft carbonation, long finish. Overall: Had pretty high expectations, and this was quite good, but wasnt a world beater for me.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"

4083,"2015-08-18",4.3,"2013 draught at OEC SourFest, 8/15/15.Good clarity on the bronze-golden body with a smattering of rapidly fizzling white clusters of bubbles.Lovely stinking cheese, unripened limeskin, hickory nut skin and fairly strong lactic acidity in the nose are all delightful and well in-tune with what Id expect from a piece of Hanssens Oude Gueuze (the dry, fruity citric elements are very characteristic, as are the more reserved funk and some light green apple (not acetyldehyde)). Really nice, sniffable stuff with no flaws, alcohol or any thing I have to complain about.In the mouth, its actually lightly carbonated, though from some refermentation Id imagine, as the carbonation is tight and natural-seeming. Light oak can be picked out, while plentiful lactic elements display various notes of cheese, grapefruit rind and yogurt. Not tremendously sour as the sourest of lambics, but certainly nothing to scoff at. Malt and wheat add light flavors and good texture and the fruity tartness and pleasant acidity lingers on. Delicious, though I was kind of hoping it was flat...","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

4083,"2007-05-27",4.0,"A very nice and so complex taste. With a long after taste. Still some sweetness in it. Beer from 2005. Should be 5% alcohol","Hoboken, BELGIUM","oberabcbbsok"
4083,"2007-05-27",3.8,"Draught  Foxy-ochre beer; small transparant rim. Ghurkins, sage, wood, a lot of saddlesoap, bit of pineapple. Still some (restrained) sweetness, despite its 2 years; lemon, dry hay or straw, pineapple flavours. In the MF, the real age shows: dryness, very light bodied, long, tannine-rich aftertaste. Very good lambic, not only because of its palate, but also because of its blending potency.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

4083,"2006-06-14",3.5,"Draught. Bright orange-copper with no head - somewhat dull. Smells of musty hay, oaken wood, bread, and pine. Smooth, flat body - sharp acidity. Some wood and bitterness in the finish along with some grapefruit citric twang. Pretty cool but I preferred others.
