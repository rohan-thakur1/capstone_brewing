2323,"2016-06-26",4.0,"Vörösesbarna árnyalatban kerül elő az üvegből a kanadai főzde apátsági stílusú söre, mely testvérétől, a Lupulus-verziótól igencsak különbözik, számomra mégis szimpatikusabb, s a belga mondanivalót is autentikus módon hordozza, így a műfajra jellemző jegyek is sokkal jobban érvényesülnek. Mint például a különféle aszalt nyalánkságok, füge és rumos datolya, törökmogyoró, kékszőlő és dió vonalai, melyek egy élénk, alkoholos fátyol alatt teljesednek ki. Íze sem szab korlátokat az előbbi aromák testet öltésének, szerkezete befogadja a mazsolás-süteménytésztás, likőrös-aszalványos, de mindenekelőtt belga élesztős komponenseket, nem a legsúlyosabb azonban az ízvilág, a karakternek pedig egy árnyalatnyit kisebb szemű buborékokkal tarkított, krémesebb szénsavtartalom előnyére válna, bár ez utóbbi hiányérzet az idő előrehaladtával szinte megszűnik, csillapodik ugyanis az élénkség, jobban kisimul a test.

2323,"2016-06-16",4.1,"750mL bottle, very generous extra from JulienHuxley. Cant quite make out the date, as its badly smudged, but its sometime in 2015, I believe. Drunk 6/9/16.Massive, overflowing, light beige head that is very well-retained, tops a ruby-tinged mahogany/beige body with good clarity.Brown sugar, brown bread, hazelnuts, vanilla, clove, black pepper, honey, the list goes on, as it should for a Belgian Strong ale, which showcases both specialty malt and yeast (as well as some spice here). It all works in a pretty harmonious balance, the more ""dry"" phenols and spices winning out, but never out-of-balance. Tons of fruitiness (red fruits) is highly enjoyable and bright and theres no sign of booze or any astringency. The esters are clean and the aroma is just all-around well-executed.Rich honey, brown bread and light cinnamon all combine with a strong sense of balance. Dries out considerably on the end with light fruitiness, some earthy, crunchy cereal-like notes and light hints of vanilla. Maybe just a bit more clove-like character than Id like, overall, but thats really the only complaint here. The carbonation and malty texture are both perfect as are the classy esters. Even the spice, which is moderately apparent, is a welcome complexity and blends in/matches with the phenols and malts. No alcohol either. Great balance.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Thats a big, complicated, not entirely approachable beer.

I opened this and was immediately reminded of The Body Shop. The mix of spices and flowery scents did it.

Looms great. Nve clear reddish brown pour with a nice light tan head. Spicy flowery nose that is also a bit boozy. 

Odd taste. Very low on the beer qualities. Its like a shandy or something. The spices take over and you are not left with enough ""beer""

Taking the first sip a slight sour fruit notes works well in the middle with lots of prunes and raisin notes. Light roasted malts with earthy flavours and toffee coming together.

2323,"2013-12-02",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2015 Bière brune foncé aux reflets rubis, bien brouillée dune multitudes de particules en suspension, bonne effervescence, et surmontée dun col brunâtre pas tellement large et moyennement dense, mais bien persistant. Arômes principalement malté, pain grillé et beaucoup de caramel, avec également beaucoup de fruits foncés bien mûrs voire confit (raisin, cerise, prune/pruneau, datte) et un peu de noix de Grenoble. Aussi, on note également quelques effluves de malt fumée, de tourbe, de terre, de boisé et de feuilles mortes, ainsi que dagréables arômes liés à la fermentation, de plaisantes notes alcoolisées, de la banane bien mûre et des phénols épicés (poivre, clou de girofle, vanille). Enfin, dautres épices chaudes (piment de la Jamaïque, muscade) semblent être également présentes dans ce merveilleux nez dune profonde complexité et dune intensité très élevée. En bouche, pétillement modéré sur la langue, avec onctuosité élevée au palais, cest velouté et soyeux, mais aussi liquoreux et éthylique. Au goût, le pain grillé, le caramel et les fruits foncés dominent, avec des noix de Grenoble et un alcool significativement plus présent quau nez mais qui est très agréable et fort bien intégré. Aussi, légères saveurs de terre, boisé et feuille morte. On note également une bonne dose de banane bien mûre, voire flambée et caramélisée, mais les épices se font quant à eux plus subtils en bouche quau nez. Enfin, on décèle une pointe herbacée en fin de bouche, peut-être le houblon, ou une autre saveur liée aux phénols. Lamertume est minimale voire inexistante, la finale étant principalement alcoolisée avec notes de banane et de caramel. Bière chaleureuse et plutôt sucrée (mais pas trop, en tout cas pour moi, elle est parfaite!), excellente intégration des différentes saveurs, complexité et intensité très élevée en bouche. Excellente bière! /// On dit que cette bière a un excellent potentiel de vieillissement, et jai laissé vieillir une bouteille plus de 3 ans. Wow! Explosion des saveurs maltées, intégration parfaite des saveurs liées à la fermentation (banane, phénols épicés), douceur incroyable, alcool qui nest plus du tout perceptible, ni au goût, ni au palais, mais on perd la «pointe herbacée» (qui venait donc du houblon).

Big plum candy, dark fruit, rose, interesting unique medley of spices that I cant name. Incense? Some tobacco, some kind of herb that one might be inclined to burn for aromatics. Something floral, or medicinal about it? Really weird, herbal, spicy dark fruity aroma, so bizarre. Some caramel malt. Spicy taste, moderate bitter, minimal sweet. Just a light hint of alcohol warmth, its reasonably well hidden under the intense aroma. Smooth, kind of crisp lighter carbonation, more dry finish, and a big body.

One the other hand, sarsaparilla notes totally dominated the beer. I dont know if sarsaparilla root was put into the beer, but it tasted like unsweeted and fairly pleasant Rootbeer. Since I like Rootbeer, I rather enjoyed this beer, but totally over spiced. Perhaps drinking it fresher would be more beneficial, but given the style aging seems appropriate.

2323,"2012-12-09",3.7,"It took me 4 bottles through 1 1/2 year to evaluate this one. Two bottles were tremendous and two were very deceiving. So, Ill do sort of an average between the four of them.
Aroma: A lot of spices; cinnamon, clove, mixed with caramel, sugar cane and candied fruits. Most of the bottles tested had a pretty complex and defined nose except for the last one that was bought a week ago which had aroma disappearing fast and leaving unpleasant meat and earthy notes.
Appearance: One of the bottles tested last spring had no head at all. The other ones had an average creamy, moderately lasting head with also average lacing.Color is dark brown with red glints.
Taste is very caramel, toffee, crème brulée  and maple with spices like pepper, nutmeg and clove. In all cases it would benefit the overall taste that the spices stick out more. Sugar notes are very dominant. In most cases body is medium, texture is oily and carbonation lively except for that bottle bought last spring that was absolutely flat. I was told at the time that there had been a bottling problem with that batch. Not recalling the batch was, to my opinion, a poor corporate decision. The conclusion of all this is thats a very unstable beer. If youre lucky, youll buy a very good bottle. If not; well, tough luck.

Taste is similar to Gouden Carolus: mild chocolate, licorice, dark fruits, but not nearly as sweet or alcoholic feeling. Not too minerally. Decently heavy mouthfeel but not overwhelming. Palate is effervescent, clovey, sugary. Plays a difficult roll in being sweet and dark fruit heavy without being cloying or syrupy. Believe it or not, but this is a little bit reminiscent of Westvleteren 8.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

At first pour, the nose was rather sour. After breathing a bit, the spices came out. Mostly liquorice (anise) was on top, with hints of mint, nutmeg and cloves.

Wonderful taste as well - Light spices and caramel together with the nutmeg / clove mix, plum, brown sugar, perfect sweetness, mild molasses and probably something else, licorice. Very good complexity without the need to search and concentrate. Perfect carbonation, hints of alcohol here and there, long lasting coating and a lengthy light spicy finish.

A spicy nose greets the senses and has an heir of a pumpkin brew  as nutmeg and allspice can be noted. A Belgian yeasty estery nose also sneaks int later in the nose adding some additional spiciness imparted from the yeast. Flavor star with a yeasty Belgian kick but quickly moves to a nutmeg, allspice and estery presence and finishes with a bready ending and slight brown sugar kick. I got an odd flavor that I can only describe as grilled mild Italian sausage taste in the middle. Body is heavy with a slight sharpness from the carbonation. Overall an interesting combination.

Flavor takes a while to develop, then explodes with heavy heavy spice. Definitely a winter beer- reminds me of those gimmicky Christmas ales, but to be fair, it has a little more going on. Some molasses and caramel malt, but that beautiful nectarine profile from the aroma has been overpowered by the mulled spice. Bittersweet chocolate creeps in as well.

Hints of alcohol and raisins. Medium carbonation, good mouthfeel. Taste is yeasty, a tiny bit metallic, prunes. Almost no trace of alcohol. Incredible balance, very well crafted.

Appearance : Dark amber

Aroma : Lots of spices, cloves light hint of raisins.

Taste : Cloves, spices, some dark fruits and raisins.

Overall : HUGE disapointment. Too much spices. You can feel the original beer underneath but it is burried under layers and layers of spices. The other bottle I had was the 2007 and was 1 year old. With a bit of luck the spices on this one will fade out eventually. Looks like the whole Dominus Vobiscum line got spiced up in the last year and I dont like this (they say its coming from the yeast). I guess I will now drown my tears with some Lupulus (which is not a spice bomb and is freaking awesome !)","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

the flavor is odd... it reminds me of jagermeister... a terribly sweet mix of cardamom, licorice, fennel, molasses, clove, golden raisins and caramel... yuck! but for some reason it keeps drawing me back in (i DO like me some jager!). on the second day the sweetness starts to take over... it becomes even more prominent but shows some notes of wood, toasted nuts, sweet sticky barley and some cocoa butter.

2323,"2009-01-06",4.0,"Bottle acquired from Phyl21ca many moons ago poured into a snifter.

Pours a dark mahogany that shows through as a clear deep copper when held up to light.  The head was a massive off-white crown that lingered as a one0inch cap for the duration leaving tons of lacing.

The aroma was very surprising and dominated by spices and a yeasty sweetness - definitely some coriander, ginger and a candi apple sweetness.  There is bits of dark fruit with figs and some caramel, but the spiciness was the most striking feature.

The taste follows the aroma and has the interesting spicy yeast flavor that dominates with figs and red apples playing a part as well.  There was lots of caramel malts underpinning everything else but the melding of the spices with the Belgian yeast and fruit sweetness was very good.

The mouthfeel is unbelievably creamy with lots of carbonation and completely coats the palate.

This is one of the more interesting Belgian strong ales I’ve ever tasted and the spiciness made it very complex and very original.  The alcohol was nearly non-existent so drinkability is pretty high given the size of the beer.  Worth a try if you can find it.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

2323,"2008-12-12",4.0,"750ml from Glouglouburp. Thanks, Dany, from a trade a few months back. My initial impression of the beer was that this is a jumped up version of the truly fine dubbel this brewery produces. A fairly viscous dark pour with a sizable head, this is a highly spiced strong ale, with the complexity of a quad but the drinkability of a milder dark ale. Dangerous. The nose is very rich and appealing, filled with spice, quirky fruit characteristics, and an unexpected chile note, like ancho rub or something close to that. As the beer settles in, it is the fruit and hops that tend to come through the overall thick beer. The finish is lengthy, with just a trace of dry funk in there to make it quirkier than you thought. 
All in all, yet another example of how fine this brewery is.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Fluffy mouthfeel with a softly sweet flavor which is balanced by a complex herbal spiciness. Honey and candy-sugar sweetness is there, yet it remains soft along with toasted coriander and mild herbal suggestion to spice things up. The finish has residual herbal notes along with slim toasted Belgian malt character. Very unique and complex. Great stuff!","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

Nose is tons of apple and spicy yeast. The taste of this one really knocks you over with its sweetness. Its maybe a little too sweet. There is some spices in there in an attempt to add some balancing spiciness (ginger maybe?) but its so sweet. Only at the end do the hops make a fleeting appearance for a rather rough dose of bitterness. Bit of a hazelnut praline finish thats quite tasty. Alcohol is very well hidden.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"

2323,"2008-02-27",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2008 In short: A peppery dark Belgian ale with dark fruits and nutty flavours.  Excellent.
How: Bottle 750ml, 2 months old
The look: Brown-ruby body with a long-lasting large beige head
In long: Peppery nose.  Rich creamy mouthfeel, grainy malts, somewhat yeasty, doughy.  Initially the beer presents notes of dark fruits (figs, dates and friends) but as it warms up (I drank an Orval halfway through) the fruity notes fade away making room for a nice creamy nutty flavour.  Grounded black pepper remains an upfront flavour but thats no problem to me as I am one of those who mourn the first batch of Dieu Du Ciel Route des Épices (the batch that was so peppery that they had to tame it down).  At a tasting session we had both the Lupulus and Hibernus at and I was initially more impressed by the Lupulus.  However after drinking a full bottle of each I found that the Lupulus starts amazing (4.4) but I got used to it while the Hibernus starts very good (3.8) but really grew on me.  I ended-up finding both equally excellent (4.2).  Both of these two pricy beers are as good as sex and unfortunately in my case just about as expensive.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2323,"2007-12-23",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2010 My Bottom Line:
Black pepper, licorice and nutmeg flourish atop the dates and cherries in this masterful Belgian Strong Ale. The estery yeast profile, the authentic mouthfeel and the productive union of maltiness and spices have rendered quite the superlative symphony.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A proud crest of foam decorates the misty blood red.
-Star anise spiciness also emerges from the precise spice interplay, which also seems to include cloves and coriander, amongst others.
-Fertile earthiness also rises from the malt/yeast/spice cohesion.
-The body is beautifully sculpted; with its frothy carbonation and perfect attenuation, it never feels cumbersome for a beer this gravity.
-The spices in the 2009 vintage are better levelled than the 2007s.
-The black pepper flavors drop with a year or so on it, and licorice comes out more. A fantastic beer every way you look at it.
