841,"2016-10-08",3.7,"For me this style has yet to be completely defined.Ive had several imperial pilsners, and they werent sure what they were trying to be, like a confused hybrid. THIS IS what an imperial pils should be; malty, strong hops, higher abv. Solid. Great on this fall morning with a fire going in the back yard.","Hazelwood, Missouri, USA","StLsportsfan"
841,"2016-09-18",3.3,"Bottle poured into a stein. Mostly clear golden yellow with an average white head. Aroma is grains, floral hops, and bread. Taste is bread, lots of malts, grain, and grassy, herbal hops. Average thickness. Not my favorite style but well executed.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Thechasm442"
841,"2016-08-28",3.7,"16oz bottle. Big, bold noble hops. Creamy true lager notes. Spicy hop tones. Full bodied. Very true to style, impressive. Big lager.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
841,"2016-08-12",3.2,"500 ml bottle thanks to Eugene. Paired with late night science writing and Olympics swimming. Clear pale pour, ample white head, decent retention, steadily rising stream of bubbles. Aroma initial: creamed corn, grass, a bit of sulfur. Taste: wow, was not expecting that. Big sweet thick caramel malt presence and intensely harsh bitter end. Like an old school punch you in the throat bitter IPA. Damn. Palate: medium+ body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. Overall: judging by the commercial description, they hit the mark they were going for, even if it doesnt particularly appeal to me.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
841,"2016-08-09",3.2,"Draft at the Grove brewery. Golden and stoic, this is a muscular beer to be labeled a Pilsner. Who decided that any beer style could be ""imperialized?"" Its a solid, strong lager that I enjoyed. But theres no snappy bite like my favorite pilsners. (#6271, 8/9/2016)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
841,"2016-07-17",3.3,"Clear golden brown. A lot of lacing. Very crisp. Cracker dry. On tap at brewery.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","gregwilsonstl"
841,"2015-06-18",3.6,"Bottle. Pours a golden color with a big head and some lacing. Aroma of light malt sweetness, bit of citrus and grain. Taste of malt sweetness, bit of citrus and grain. Mild bitterness and a fairly dry finish. Moderate body, smooth with a bit of a malty feel. Enjoyable beer that goes down easy.","St. Charles, Missouri, USA","Bif"
841,"2015-04-28",3.6,"Bottle. Color was a dull dark gold with a foamy white head. Aroma was somewhat mild, with bread and earthy hop notes. Flavor was better with a good sweetness, a lot of caramel and bread notes. Hops were a nice blend of fruit and earth notes.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"
841,"2015-03-19",3.6,"Hazy, golden pour with a frothy, white head. The aroma has floral, earthy hops. It has a light, smooth body with lively carbonation. The taste is mildly sweet with a quick, somewhat dry finish.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","Finhead"
841,"2015-01-31",3.3,"Draft to taster. Looks good; a transparent golden orange with white head. Smells of lots of pilsner malt with notes of lager yeast and mild hops. Tastes like it smells with a pleasantly snappy mouthfeel. A solid take on the style; but bigger and maltier than I prefer my pilsners (although I know thats what they were going for).","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
841,"2015-01-30",3.6,"500ml bottle. No code date. Appearance: golden and hazy with a frothy whites foam cap. 
Aroma: light pils malt and a nice floral hop aroma
Taste: Strong, rich pilsner malt flavor, with a strong noble hop bitterness to balance. Flavor is very much like a strong German Pils. 
Mouthfeel: heavier body than a typical pils, with a slight creaminess and moderate carbonation. 
Finish: Finishes with a good balance of malt and bitterness. Dry, with bitterness that slightly lingers. 
Overall: Taste of this beer completely matches what I was expecting from this beer. Despite the higher ABV this manages to retain the right balance of pils malt and hop character.","","TH28"
841,"2014-12-29",3.6,"On tap at Peels in OFallon, IL. Pours a slightly cloudy yellow/golden with a decent small bead white head with plenty of lacing. Aroma is grassy and bready. Taste is sweet pale malt, soda biscuits, and mild hop bitterness along with some grassiness and pine. This is an excellent impy pils in that it is two things that seem to elude even the finest craft brewers with this style. 1) It is well balanced, and 2) It is not cursed with the typical ""malt liquor"" off alcohol smell and taste. Great effort!","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
841,"2014-12-21",3.6,"500 ml bottle from a UCBC mixed 8-pack at Schnucks. Pours a pretty much clear gold with a finger of frothy white head that takes a while to settle and laces the glass. Aroma and flavor go hand in hand here - crackery and bready pils malts, German-style hops (grassy, earthy, and fresh), straw, leaves, and a hint of fruit. Medium-bodied, with medium carbonation and a malty, bready, and bitter mouthfeel. This normally isnt a style I like but theyve done it really well.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
841,"2014-12-19",4.0,"This is a nice imperial pilsner. Good biscuity crackery malt aroma and taste, solid bittering and nice hop presence. Brilliantly clear and a dry finish.","","Quetzolcotl"
841,"2014-12-11",3.7,"Pours clear golden / orange with a large white soapy head. The aroma has big smooth clean pils malt and is very cereal-grain like. It also has some grassy / spicy hops and has fresh baked dough. It has a full rich body with some crispness and frothy carbonation that still has a light bite. The flavor starts with rich bready malt (still fairly dry), grass, spice, sulfur and some alcohol showing through. The finish has some crackers, more alcohol and linger sulfur and grass. Very good for the style, but the imperial version of a pils will probably never be my style of beer.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
841,"2014-12-08",4.1,"500ml bottle, big thanks to phaleslu for this one. Mostly clear golden orange color. Thin off-white head, leaving great thicker lace. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, kind of crisp, lighter carbonation. More dry finish. Kind of creamy; good full body. Awesome big spicy mildly piney peppery hop aroma. Doughy bready malt, some hints of pale tropical fruit in the background. Really curious what the hop schedule for this looked like.. Digging that german hop flavor more and more, these days. Bigger bitter taste, moderate sweet, just a very light pleasant warmth, or maybe thats just the aftertaste buzzing on my palate... Really pleasant satisfying doughy pilsenery sulfuric quality to this. Everything I love in a pilsener, but in a more concentrated form. Really digging it. Super-easy drinking and tasty. I opened this up thinking it would be a good size to satisfy me through my sandwich, but I ended up finishing the bottle way faster than the meal. I could definitely repeat this many more times.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

841,"2014-11-28",3.2,"Orange clear pour. White sticky head. Bitter and nutty flavor. Just ok. Had this on tap as part of a flight at urban chestnut brewery.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","kaser"
841,"2014-11-25",3.2,"Pour is a clear gold with a large white head. Aroma is a bit of cracker malt and a bit of wet paper bag. Flavor is better. Dry bready malt with a bit of cracker and grassy hop. Finish is clean with no alcohol burn. Im not a fan of this style but this beer is more of a pils then a heavy malt liquor like some seem to be.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
