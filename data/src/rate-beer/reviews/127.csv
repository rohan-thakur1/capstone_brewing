Wow, this has a unique and very strong aroma and flavor of apricots and candied fruits; its sweet and syrupy, although some astringency and aciity in the final contributes to the balance.Original and excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
127,"2016-01-07",3.6,"Bottle - Nice cooked apple and skin. Clear gold. Sweet and nice fruity apple sweetness and a decent finish. Touch of bitterness. Solid.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
127,"2016-01-07",4.3,"375mL bottle, pours a clear bronze / orange with no head. Aroma brings out loads of fresh apricots, followed by toffee and caramelized apples. Flavour is huge on the apricots -- surprising that there arent any in this -- fresh apricots, treacle toffee and baked apple pie. Lots of residual sugar, but never makes it unpalatable. Complex, apricot-dominant and harmonious. Awesome.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
127,"2015-11-15",4.2,"Bottle shared by Frank or Ryan. Cheers. Pours vibrant copper with no head really. Aroma is very inviting with strawberry jam, apple skins, caramel, and spicy wood.

127,"2015-05-11",4.2,"Sample from 2008 vintage.
Pours very dark amber with no head. Not so many legs. Aroma is of apples, vanilla, oak, some faint hints of slight notes reminiscent of coconut. Taste is of awesome apples, sugar, some acidity, alcohol. Palate: Full bodied. Sweet. No carbonation. Overall: Awesome apples. Amongst the best Ive ever had.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","Minderbinder"
127,"2015-05-03",3.9,"2008 vintage. Pours a clear copper with good legs. Nose is of cooked apples and not too sugary. Light apple pie reminescence. Taste is of the usual apples and brown sugar but there is something different in the acid profile. Not sure if it is because of the aging or if it was like that when it was first released. Anyhow, good and not too sweet. Body is full and mouthfeel is lightly ""sandy"" (for lack of a better word, filled with small sugar particles is what I mean) and sticky. Another nice dessert drink by Vergers Lafrance!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
127,"2015-04-29",4.0,"2oz sample from bottle, 2008 vintage. Clear deep chestnut pour light legs. Super aromatic, tons of dried plums, old apple, apple-peach butter, raisins, figs. Taste is rich, decadent, candied fruit galore, brandy soaked dried plums, overripe apple. Palate is sticky, med full bodied with long lingering finish. Slight extreme in its tendency towards old brandy soaked fruit but oh so decadent and tasty.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

127,"2011-07-22",3.8,"375 ml clear corked bottle shared by beastiefan2k with an assist to Artem and Boris. Pour is brilliant golden, still, with syrupy legs. Aroma is soft apple, warming sugar, and a spice that reminded me a bit of apple pie. Taste is super smooth apple, lightly tart, the sugar is less pronounced in the taste, and certainly less sweet - a bit more of a floral nature.  Its sweet, to be sure, but far from cloying.  Palate is silky, medium bodied, pleasantly mouth coating and lightly floral tart finish.  Nice one, thanks Eugene and friends!","Kansas, USA","theisti"

127,"2011-02-16",3.9,"Pouring at Le Mondial des Cidres Glaces.  Pours a clear golden yellow.  Bright candy and light oak and acid.  Candy sweet and tart, but slowly developing.  Big and sweet, but theres definitely something odd that took me a while to place. Finally figured out, the aftertaste tastes like Nerds candies.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
127,"2011-01-11",4.3,"375mL thanks to ygtbsm94 via Gloublouburp. Two of my favorite people obviously have good taste in ice cider. I may be a sucker for ice cider, but damn this was good. Pour is clear, deep orange gold with big legs everywhere on the glass. Aroma is simply unreal: so much robust apple character. Jonagold and Honeycrisp apples explode with both tartness and immense fresh sweetness. There is actually a baked green apple element here from the freezing process. The nose really is like pure nectar. The taste is on par with wild nectar qualities: sweet honey, ambrosia, baked fresh apples, tart apple medley. Palate is pure honey viscosity, wildly thick. Heaven in a glass. Just too good to be true.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
127,"2010-04-15",2.6,"Pours amber with no carbonation and no neck on the glass.  Smells of carmelized apples, syrup, boozy.  Tastes very sweet with some cough syrup elements.  Too intense to be enjoyable for more than a few sips.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"

Brown sugar and honeyed apples with some hints of spice in the very sweet, almost cloying flavour.  Syrupy, sticky, thick texture is rich and velvety.  Mild alcohol warming.

127,"2006-06-17",3.5,"Post-Mondial tasting at Goldoraks pad, from 375 ml bottle.   Pours a deep whisky-amber color with thick slow-falling legs in the glass....very sweet, fresh apple nose with hints of maple, thick and flowery....near-cloying mouthfeel just stops short of syrupiness, sweet apples and long-simmered applesauce with hints of cinnamon and raisin....at the finish a nice sour-tart hint makes for a bit more complexity, though the touch of iron doesnt really help matters.  Not one of my favorite ice ciders but perfectly drinkable (though probably not worth the price).","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
127,"2006-06-10",4.0,"The sweetest of their 3 ice ciders, propelling a honeyed apple aroma onto salivating nostrils...Rich mouthfeel full of apple pie filling, caramel, and honey...As good as their other ice ciders, but for double the price (45$ vs. 24$ for the others), this isnt worth the extra money...But its certainly worth a few tastes...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
127,"2006-06-04",4.0,"Still and dark gold. A vinous apple nose that shows the pleasant pear and mango nuances that the most concentrated examples often display. Not so thick as a Face cachée de la Pomme, but the cloying character is nicely coated by a charming acidity that seems natural in its fruitiness and eases up the drinkability. Body is honeyed perhaps more than maple-like and aromatic with good concentration. Mature and very enjoyable offering. Thanks for sharing Alain.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
