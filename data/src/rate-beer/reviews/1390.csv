1390,"2016-01-04",3.5,"Draught at CBM. QUite toffee-forward with decent maltiness and light bitter finish. These guys seem to brew decent European classics, too bad they are not a bit more adenturous.","","biirusaikou"
1390,"2015-07-26",3.8,"Tap at Beerfes Kamikochi 2015. Pours dark brown, edging on black. Bit of beige-brownish foam. Aroma is clean, a bit of roast coming through. Taste is actually surprising for me. There is good amount of body and roast is also medium strong. Normally I have expected Dunkels to be more watery and they usually have had some lagery cardboard character. Not here. This could even pass as a dry stout, has the body and flavour. Surprise for me.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
1390,"2015-03-29",3.8,"On tap at CBM Jimbocho. Dark brown with a small beige head. Very subtle aromas of malt, toffee, coffee and caramel chew with a hint of resiny hops. Taste is very subtle and muted on the palate. The coffee and caramel chew come out nicely. Mildly creamy mouthfeel with a medium body. Medium carbonation with a nice dry finish. Great stuff.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
1390,"2014-11-16",3.8,"Tap at Gar Eden. Sweet malty aroma, bit of caramel. Taste is lightly burnt, malty again, good stuff. Light treacle. Little bit of bitterness at the end. Good stuff.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
1390,"2014-07-21",3.7,"On tap at the GJBF in Osaka 2014. Very dark brown. 5% light caramel aroma, medium to light bodied. The taste is a well balanced light chocolate malts and just the slightest hint of roastiness. Probably the subtlest dark lager I have seen in Japan but great.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
1390,"2013-07-18",3.5,"Draught at the Great Japan Beer Festival in Osaka (7/13/2013). Good, solid roast malt nose with chocolate. Very dark brown, thin beige head. Good malty initial / clear and clean light coffee in mid, and then a bit tangy / finishes with good bitter touches. Light enough for a lager. Good balance or dark malt and hops.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
1390,"2013-04-25",3.3,"My Bottom Line:
Lightly roasted cereals and their pumpernickel allusions accept vanilla-like fruitiness in this otherwise, lean and bubbly Tmavé.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam caps the misty brown (with a nice wooden shade).
-Coffee notes are found as well.
-Hoppiness is quite understated.
-Carbonation is too prickly, not creamy or natural enough, for my tastes in the style.
-The finish is more of the same, lacking the hop bitterness that makes their Pilsner more interesting.

1390,"2011-07-28",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 8, 2015 Drank after not having for a few years. Very nice stuff and a lot more roasted character and body than i remember before. I just came back from Czech a couple months ago and this would be very respectable. Raising from 3.4 score

Original Light mouth, nice toffee, coffee character. Definitively Czech style dark lager. Refreshing with a decent amount of hops.  Nice.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
1390,"2010-07-04",3.5,"Draught at the brewery. Deep, shiny black with a lovely tan head. Rich, flavorful dark malts. Not very sweet, though, like a big hunk of black bread. Rich and dry. Very nice and drinkable. Steady and smooth.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
