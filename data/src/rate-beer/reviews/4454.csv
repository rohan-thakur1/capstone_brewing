Lightly tart cherry juice, acidic red grape, slight currant, cherry pit, a bit metallic, dry woody finish, dry leaves, slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium full and creamy with low carbonation. Not as jammy and concentrated in flavour as I had been expecting though. The metallic notes distracted a touch. Very nice but not transcendent for me.

Palate is acidic with maybe just a little sugar, light lemon juice, kriek flesh, light skin tannins, some musty cellar and oak. Finish is pretty soft, light acidity, cherry lingers, a bit of herbal bitterness underneath. Lightish of body with no real carb. Not as juicy as the Cantillon kriekenlambic as I recall it.

The nose was full of powerful cherries. Very tart with a bit of sweetness. The cherry character in this was quite amazing. Super fresh with a nice bit of acidity in the end. Slightly puckering throughout.

4454,"2010-09-17",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 20, 2011 Sampled July 2010 at 3F Lambikodroom
I talked to Armand about the Lambic that he uses to make Kriek and he said that you want to use young Lambic from the same brew season so that you get a vigorous fermentation after adding the cherries.

This is very dark, with a concentrated cherry color, it is quite clear and typically flat; the color is just so dark, again I find it quite surprising how dark these fresh Krieks are.  This smells a bit medicinal and of plastic, but it really smells mostly of cherries that reminds me of black cherries (as opposed to the typical sour type of cherry).  Hmm, this isnt really plastic, but instead reminds me of roses; huge, expressive, floral rose aromatics just seem to expansively emanate from my glass.  Sort of potpourri like, sort of a touch like a floral soap, or perhaps even carnations might be another descriptor for the nose on this beer.

The beer is still lightly sweet tasting and it finishes with a big rose-like flavor as well as a deep berry character that seems quite vinous actually.  This is very different than the Cantillon Kriekenlambik (the Cuvee Moeder version) that I had recently or even than the Schaarbeekse Kriek versions that I have had.  The rose flavors move to notes of potpourri, berry like flavors and even the berry jam like character one finds in a red wine.  This is not as tart tasting as the Lambic I just had, but there is lots of tannic character here that seems to remind me of cherry skins that stick to the teeth.

Apparently this Kriekenlambik was from the bottom of the vat, after bottling, and it is darker and more concentrated because of it; this is part of the source of the floral character and darker color that is a typical of a Kriek.  There are also some Schaarbeekse cherries in this batch.  This is just a very nice beer, I really like how unique the cherry character is in it floral quality.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Probably due to the lack of carbonation I dont know. Initial note of sweetness is immediately overtaken by the wonderful sour cherries which just go on and on right through to the finish. Totally flat but the palate is incredible. Lipsmackingly good. An honour.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

Wow, Jeppes stand at the beerfestival was amazing. This was such a good beer and probably my favurite at the festival. No carbonation. Sour, acidic nose, with some sour cherry, blood orange and acidic tomato, slightly balsamic aswell. Palate was lovely, no carbonation, but with such a juicy acdity which made me want more and more.

Consumed at the Weekend of Spontaneous Fermentation, Opstal, May 2006
Slightly sweet flavor, syrupy, low carbonation.  Sweet candy-like nose of red grapes and cheap grape juice.  Really not that impressed by this one.  Simple and juice like, in my opinion.  When I sampled this the next day at the Drie Fonteinen restaurant, it was a little better.  Had a much more striking nose of sweet, rich cherries, perhaps the most full cherry nose I’ve experienced.  However, the flavor and texture didn’t impress me too much.  Thinner than hoped, simple juice like flavors at times.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Its supposedly made from unblended lambic and schaarbeekse cherries, and is marginally sweetened.
Deep clear red. Aroma of ripe cherrues and vinegar. Sweet and woody, full of wonderful balsamic schaarbeekse cherries. Low carbonation, but the mouthfeel is fresh, lively and sparkling. Grape stone finish with a bit too much sweetness. Mindboggingly tasty.

Additional rating for the ""Dry Kriekenlambic"", 6.5%. Sampled from cask at Akkurat, Stockholm.
The same magnificent cherry aroma as the sweetened version, but this is significantly drier and more acidic. On paper this is something I like, but instead it doesnt carry the wonderful flavour of the schaarbeekse cherries as well as the sweetened version. The mouthfeel is still as soft and sparkling, and I still regard this version as ultra-superb, just a tad less wonderful than the sweetened one. (10/5/9/5/17)","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
