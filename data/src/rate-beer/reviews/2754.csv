2754,"2016-12-15",3.9,"Extremely well done. Malty, but light, effervescent and moderately fully bodied. Nutty, caramel and a decent hop backbone. Not as pleasing as it warms though.","JAPAN","jonno"
2754,"2016-10-06",3.7,"Pours nice reddish or more copper shade of amber. Nice head at first that reduces later into a thin film. Aroma is traditional for lagers, slight crisp grainy feel covered with faintly fruit-ish noble hops. Taste feels at first just nicely easydrinkable but then the subtleties start showing up. There is nice nutty thing going on, slight caramel in the taste. I am also getting bitter rowan berries and aftertaste has lots of lingering but quite tame bitterness.Does not get cloying at any point, all flavours are in good balance. Very well executed, superbly drinkable lager beer.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
2754,"2016-08-15",2.3,"On tap at Amri Ramen abd Bar, Kanazawa. Pours amber with small white head. Caramel, malty, toasted, bit nutty, salty. Sweet. Light to medium bodied.","CROATIA","Iznogud"
2754,"2016-08-10",4.3,"This is really and truly elite beer, a rarity in Japan thus far for me. Perfectly nutty grainy malt bill with a nice crisp lively hoppy finish dominated by citrus. I could drink this all day but the flavors are still very expressive and developed. A cut above anything I can remember trying in this style back home.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
2754,"2016-06-24",3.1,"Light amber color. Lots of butter popcorn and fruit but very malty. I think it is well made but wish there was more hops and had more body. Not my favorite","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
2754,"2016-06-24",3.2,"Very very Clean finish. You can pound in the summer. A bit too malty for a Pilsner :(","","Wifeofalcoholic"
2754,"2015-03-20",3.8,"On tap at CBM Koenji. Hazy amber with a modest off-white head. Huge malt aromas with caramel, toffee and a slight bubblegum presence on the nose. Taste is more of the same. Sweet with a hint of saltiness. Great breadiness and sweetness with the hops taking a backseat to the malt. Really cool lager.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
2754,"2015-01-28",3.8,"Tap at JBC. Nice. Salt, caramel, high on malt. Aroma is kind of earthy. Brown bread. Good stuff.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
2754,"2014-07-21",3.8,"On tap at the GJBF as the Okunoto Legend Lager. 5% a lovely amber lager. These guys are lager experts. A crystal clear glowing amber brown. Bready malts, good caramel. The taste is luscious and sweet, bready light malts. Deliciously light malts. Subtle goodness.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
2754,"2013-12-03",3.4,"Draft - Toasted malts and a bit nutty. Clear gold with a beige head. Toasted malts and malts with a light nutty flavour as well.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2754,"2013-12-03",3.5,"Draft to tulip
I get soy and caramel. Reddish amber, nice effervescence with a thin creamy white head. The taste is wheat, limestone, a little citrus, and hoppy.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","dfearnley"
2754,"2013-04-20",3.5,"Draught at Qbrick. Extremely fruity nose, plums, and wine-like note. Very dark straw, near amber color. Some umami hits immediately, morphs into fishy flavors, and then a nicely bitter finish. Very nice. Just a touch of harshness. Very full-bodied stuff, with mature flavors. Ale-like, really.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
2754,"2010-07-04",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 21, 2014 Draught at the brewpub. 
Medium amber-orange color. Interesting aroma of crackers, salt, a bit of caramel, plus a strange fruitiness. Light caramel sweetness with apricots and salt-minerals. Light, interesting and tasty. The deep sea water adds a strange and original mineral character.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
