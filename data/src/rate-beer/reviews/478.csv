Fairly light body, I suppose due to the ABV in part. The coffee comes through pleasantly enough in the taste despite that, but theres also some ashen character in the initial taste, a bit like a too bitter French press.

478,"2015-08-21",4.2,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a very dark brown, nearly black, color with a small tan colored head of one finger height. The head has a decent level of retention fading over a moderate amount of time to leave a good deal of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is massive of a coffee smell mixed with a nice showing of a roasty smell and a little bit of cream like aroma. Along with these smells comes a light caramel sweetness and a little bit of a burnt toast smell, giving a very nice deep and dark strong expresso like smell overall.
 Taste  The taste begins as the nose would suggest with a whole lot of roasted malt and a strong showing of coffee. Upfront there is a bit of a caramel sweetness which seems to fade as the taste advances. While the caramel fades, other sweeter flavors of a light vanilla and sweet crème flavor come to the tongue. These remain lighter overall keeping the taste on the drier side. More and more roast and coffee come to the tongue at the end of the taste, where with a little bit of an earthy and char taste, end up leaving one with a nice dark and roasty coffee flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is average to slightly lower for a stout of 6.4 % abv., with a carbonation level that is rather average. A thicker body and lower carbonation level may have accentuated the nice coffee and roasted flavors slightly better, but overall, the feel was OK.

 Overall  This is a very nice coffee heavy flavored stout with tons of roasty and dark flavors. The taste and aroma are nearly spot on, with the only thing holding it back a bit being its moderate mouthfeel. Even with that said, I must say this is a nice, more moderate in abv. stout overall .","","Darkmagus82"

478,"2015-05-29",4.0,"American stout from this renowned brewery, with a very dark, hazy burgundy colour, practically black, under a creamy, lacing, dense, tan head with very good retention. Strong and very pleasant, flawless aroma of espresso and coffee beans, cocoa powder and meat broth all working well together and forming a true stout experience, hoppy hints of black pepper and grapefruit peel (I even fancy myself in a black IPA for a brief moment), wet leather, dry autumn leaves, peat, blood (iron in a natural kind of way), brown bread, chestnuts, dried plums, subtle hints of cigar tobacco, elderberries and whisky, even a very subtle touch of sweet cherries as it warms up - in fact, it becomes sweeter and friendlier as a whole when warming up, so Id recommend serving this at cellar temperature and letting it warm to room temperature to be able to fully savour it. Dried fruits in the onset, only restrainedly raisin and dates sweetishness but also bittering already a bit on the tip of the tongue; creamy, soft mouthfeel with finely sparkling carbo, smooth, with a full, decent maltiness growing darker and darker in the end; deeply nutty at first but already with a big dosis of bitter chocolate, and a clear coffee-like roasted bitterness, already well noticeable in the beginning, but gaining strength as it evolves and eventually supporting a generous dosis of peppery, spicy, long-lasting, resinous hops and some lingering yeastiness, though it is still the black coffee roastedness which establishes itself as the final impression; alcohol remains almost perfectly hidden (as it should be in a beer of this ABV). Dry, smooth but coffeeish and bitter with a strong hop bitterness in the end: this is indeed a very typical and well-crafted example of the ordinary American stout style (if such a thing exists), related to the old European dry and export stouts.  I particularly like the fact that it keeps an overall bitter flavour throughout its palate and ends satisfyingly dry - that is, no cloying sweetness at all.  Extremely well-balanced.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

478,"2015-05-15",4.6,"If youre going to name your beer after a gorgeous Oregonian natural wonder, your beer damn well better be a gorgeous Oregonian natural wonder. Obsidian Stout delivers. It pours the color and consistency of ink. Lovely head and lacing, too. Its aromas are roasty and somewhat chocolaty. Flavors follow the aroma with coffee and traces of (milk and dark) chocolate. When I say this Stout is bittersweet, I mean it truly treads the line between bitter and sweet. The bitter hops go nicely with the toasted malt flavors (which are redolent coffee bean acidity). On the sweet side are the malty, chocolaty notes. While the balance is splendid, its also the thing that keeps Obsidian from being a perfect score for me. While some love balance, I tend to prefer a Stout (even a complex one like this) to choose side rather than pick the middle. I say be rich or roasty. Still, its hard (and perhaps unnecessarily nit-picky) to fault the balance. Obsidian is a brilliant example of the American-style Stout.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate-heavy dark chocolate, lighter espresso, roasted malt, light anise, burnt notes, and a hint of smoke. It pours a dark brown, virtually black, with a large creamy tan head that has great retention. There is a lot of thin webbing left on the sides of the glass.

On a closer whiff there is more coffee; bitter and heavy roasted, a touch of charred wood, liquorice root, topsoil, heated tyre rubber - all in quite pleasant and sound. Appearance is impressive. A messy plumage of tannish foam holds steady atop a midnight brown body - opaque in the depths. Unexpectedly lean on the palate. Malty bitter with a touch of cola tanginess. Long, roasted malt, coffee bean and burnt wood finish. Not much melding on the palate, but it is dark malt dominated. Pleasant drinking but a little weaker than Id anticipated.

The appearance had a dark brown/close to black colored body with a two finger off-white/tan foamy head that rises a bit and then drops gently leaving some thick spider web lacing gracing the sides of the glass.
The smell has a smokey, woody, espresso, and roasty combined fantastically.
The taste took all of those previously mentioned aromas entering a sort of sweetness from some light chocolate and some light vanilla, dry espresso aftertaste, dry sticky finish.
On the palate, she sat about a medium, semi-sessionable, carbonation is done very well for its style and for me, becomes slightly creamy.

Of course, aided by the nitro, this pours a beautiful black body with a very soft velvet, marshmallow head - tan in color - which sticks around forever and leaves a heavy spray of lace all over the empty glass. The taste is a nice blend of medium light sweet and medium light bitter with flavors of espresso, grass, some ash-like quality, toasted grain, nuts, and chocolate milk. Its a pretty slcik texture with a medium full body and an unnoticed / impossibly smooth carbonation.

You get the dark chocolate and smooth roasted flavor combining and then transitioning into a coffee with light cream. Finishes with a little sweetness and lingering coffee and bitterness. Mouthfeel flirts at being both soft and creamy with a medium body and medium/high carbonation. Good stout that has more sweetness than some but not too much. Has a smooth bitterness and overall smooth character to the flavors. Nothing overpowers but blends nicely and tastes bigger than it is. If it has any fault its that may be over carbonated.

A: Pours a black coffee with a hint more darkness and has only limited translucency. Single finger light latte head dissipates leaving a medium sheet of the same. Spots of lacing.

S: Roasty, oaty, coffee, grains, malts, light earthy hops. Hints of fruity yeast. Somewhat sandy scent. Very nice. Not quite Kalamazoo stout, but very good.

T: Taste matches the nose, very good. Only diff would be that here is a good bittering component I didnt anticipate. I really like this as a stout. As it warms, it gets better too. Absolutely one of the finer examples Ive had.

M: Creamy and smooth beer. Mouth velvet. Lower carbonation, long resonance. Again, very nice. Lovely.

D: I think I might make this part of my regular lineup. Its just outstanding as a stout. I wonder why theyve never made (to my knowledge), an imperial of this one.

478,"2013-06-20",3.8,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip.

With the initial pour, Obsidian Stout has a huge, thick, frothy mocha head. It recedes over time but still retains a reasonable cap and leaves some nice lace down the sides. The beer itself is impressively dark with just a little bit of a dark cherry edge.

The aroma is totally full of roasted flavor. Some dark chocolate and smokey tobacco complement the malt nicely, with a small bitter hop presence as well.

Dark roasted malt really dominates the flavor. There are some notes of coffee, smoke, and dark unsweetened chocolate. A citrus hop kick comes in at the end, and there is a modestly bitter aftertaste.

There is a bitter and slightly acidic feel, like a strong cup of coffee. The carbonation is creamy with a little bite and ends up being a little bit on the light side of medium. There is a light acidity toward the end of the sip.

Appearance: Big beautiful 2 to 2&1/2 finger size head that is khaki color with tight condensed bubbles. It is a dark black beer with absolutley no light penetration through this beer. The lacing on this is ridiculous as I swirl the glass it really sticks to the side. I was taken by the head that formed on this. Awesome!

Smell: Upfront is the espresso and toasted malts along with dark chocolate and nuts. I get some slight molasses and some fairly noticable hops.

Taste: Roasted malts big time! Some bitter chocolate and mild coffee present. A noticable bitter hoppy finish for a stout that prevents any overly sweet finish.

Mouthfeel: Somewhat thin for a stout and rather carbonated. Not slick or viscous but that is nice on this one because it makes it highly drinkable.

Overall: This is a nice change of pace stout for me. Slightly hoppy and roasted goodness through and through. Low abv makes this easy to drink and that is apparent as my glass is nearing empty and only after about 10 minutes.","Illinois, USA","Sleuthdogg"

Theres also a good amount of lacing left on the glass.  Aroma is good and malty, the brew smells like roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and charred/burnt malt.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, with the roasty/charred bitter flavors being the strongest.  Theres also some light hops noticeable, along with a roasty/ashy bitter finish.

478,"2011-11-17",2.7,"On nitro-tap at the Holy Grail Pub in Plano. 

The beer pours a deep, black color with a large nitro-induced tan head. The aroma is full of roasted malt and chocolate, just as I expected. The flavor is where the nitro really takes away from the beer. I get quite a bit of chocolate and roasted malt, but the nitro thins out the mouthfeel and makes the beer taste watery. There is also a little bit of coffee in the flavor. Thin to medium, watery mouthfeel. I am not sure why people put beers on nitro, but the next one I enjoy will be my first. 

Hopefully I will be able to try this beer in the bottle or on regular tap so I can re-review it, since I am sure it is a better beer when not on nitro.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"

478,"2011-09-04",4.4,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Pint.

Appearance: Extremely dark brown that might as well be black. Has a large brown head at first that leaves some lacing rings.

Aroma: Roasted barley, coffee, molasses and just a hint of chocolate. Initial whiff seemed hoppy as well, but that did not last. While it smells very good, this is the least powerful part of the beer.

Taste: Strong, almost burnt, roasted barley with a major coffee profile, some bittersweet dark chocolate, molasses, and just a titch of licorice. Ends somewhat bitter with a burnt and hoppy bite.

Palate: Moderate carbonation, very smooth, full and creamy profile, and a dry finish. The carbonation was a little higher than expected (krausening process?) but it is not overdone and may even make the otherwise full beer more lively.

Overall: This is about as good as a non-Imperial American Stout can get, but I may give the edge to Bells Kalamazoo. Deschutes really knows how to make roasted beers (this, Black Butte Porter, Black Butte XXI, Hop in the Dark) - I have yet to try Abyss but I assume it will keep this trend alive.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

478,"2011-02-20",3.8,"Got a 12oz bottle in a trade with StumpyJoeJr (thanks, Ryan!)
Poured into a nonic pint glass.

A: Jet black but slightly translucent. Nice dark tan, foamy head that retains well but lacks lacing. 

S: Typical American stout with a light dairy quality, a touch of roasted malts and dark chocolate.

T:  This is everything I look for in an American Stout - sweet, tasty,  milky/oaty flavor up front and deeply roasted (almost burnt) malts on  the backend. Not quite as robust or complex as Id prefer, though. It  remains sweet throughout, but the malty notes fade as I drink on.  Theres a touch of chocolate here, but I have to reach for it.

M: Not too thin, not too thick. Slightly fizzy on the tongue - very belch-inducing for a stout.

D:  Because the palate is flavorful, but not too intense and the body is  only medium, Deschutes Obsidian stout is dangerously drinkable. 6.4% ABV  actually seems a little high as this beer has the drinkability of a  more deliberately sessionable stout.

Overall, a good American  stout. Im surprised this beer is rated as high as it is because theres  nothing here you cant find in any other American stout. Definitely a  solid performer, though.

A - Very dark, opaque black color. Good sized, rocky, sticky, fluffy, creamy, cafe colored head. Very nice retention leaving a thick creamy lace.

S - Wonderful aroma full of chocolate (both mild and dark), coffee, roasted malt and an earthy tone. Chocolate and coffee are the strongest. Touches of citrus and grassy hops. Touches of hops provide a nice kick with the strong stout aroma.

T - Great mix of dark chocolate and coffee provide the strongest flavors. Nice bittersweet flavors. Slightly burnt/toasted dark malt that fits the bittersweet flavor profile. Earthy tones come out mid sip. Finishes with a nice citrus and slightly earthy and grassy hop kick. Very enjoyable beer.

M - Medium body with adequate carbonation. Smooth although not quite as full as I would want.

D - Very easy to drink. Balanced with great chocolate and coffee flavors and a nice hoppy taste showing up. Goes down easy, with a somewhat low ABV (for an American stout) and loads of flavors.

This beer pours black, like the volcanic rock (sorry, I stole that from the description) with a two-finger tan head and great lacing.

Aroma is a little muted by the nitro foam, but a little straining of the nostrils reveals a pleasant smell of rich chocolate and roasted malts, with maybe a little coffee as well.

This is a solid, satisfying beer with a rich roasted malt flavor (sorry, stole that from the description again).  Damn, this one is chocolatey.  The dark chocolate Ghirardelli chips I am eating for breakfast this morning as I write this (breakfast of champions I know) remind me of this beer.  It is roasty as well, with notes of coffee and charred volcanic ash, which is fitting given the name.

Extremely smooth on the mouthfeel, which I know is helped by the nitro, with medium-full body.  Some slight drying from the roastiness.

This beer reminds me of the worlds largest obsidian flows at Newberry Volcano--just a few miles south of the brewery.

478,"2010-05-01",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 7, 2012 Just pouring this beer into the glass makes my mouth water.  Im not a huge fan of stouts (with the exception of imperial stouts), but this one is an exception.  If its from Deschutes, it has to be good.  Especially when the beer (as this one) falls in the 99th percentile for both style and overall.  It pours a nice, solid black color with light sediment, forming a light-brown, very stiff and frothy head and very thick, strong lacing that stretches the entire length of the glass.  

Its aroma is delicious, with a slightly predominant note of chocolate, followed by light roasted malt and a hint of dryness.  It also has floral, almost spiced notes as well.  In the mouth its easy-going  and just a little soapy.  Its more dry than the aroma lets on, and the sweet chocolate aroma transforms into a bitter cocoa powder flavor.  Residual sweetness is just barely delivered, but overpowered by an almost oxidized, highly roasted malt bitterness.

Thanks to someone for sending this in a trade.  I lost track as it sat in the back of the ""to drink"" fridge but finally got around to it on a nice summer afternoon.  This was well worth the wait; if Deschutes was readily available in Ohio I might pick up a sixer for a party.  Its a great stout that would be appreciated even by the casual drinker.

Aroma / Appearance - Rich and thick the cream colored head bobs above a reddish black body which swirls effortlessly around the snifter.  Creamy milk, a drizzle of chocolate, vanilla, and a trace amount of coffee gives this a nice overall feel.

Flavor / Palate - Fluid, the mouthfeel reveals a mix of toasted rye, dry malt, and smoke which sticks in the throat.  Sitting well from start to finish it has a good presence that is balanced.  The coffee and licorice transition about halfway through the bottle improves an already solid stout.  Those of you who can get this locally should count yourself lucky.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

478,"2009-06-22",3.9,"12oz bottle courtesy of josephselander poured into a tulip.

Pours clear mahogany brown out of the bottle and settles in almost completely black in the glass with a gorgeous tan head that sticks stubbornly to the sides of the glass and remains an inch-thick cap for the duration.  One of the better stouts Ive seen in terms of appearance.

The aroma is actually a little sweeter than I was expecting with a big chocolate malt presence with hints of vanilla and caramel.  There is only a slight toasted grain character to the smell but the sweetness is really dominant.

The taste starts out like the aroma and has an initial chocolate malt sweetness with a hint of toasted malts in the background.  The finish is what really stands out vs. the aroma as there is a big roasted coffee bitterness that was nearly non-existent in the aroma.  I think there are even a bit of hops in the finish as well.

The mouthfeel is interesting as its smooth and creamy for the first half of the sip, but the finish is extremely dry and bitter.  Very interesting to see the two elements melded together in one beer.

This is certainly one of the better standard stouts Ive had recently and the Jekyll & Hyde type taste is very unique and well executed.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

The look: Black body topped by a long lasting small tan head
In long: Generic but pleasant moderately roasted, moderately chocolaty and moderately fruity stout.  The pleasant body is rather full but very soft and with a smooth carbonation.  Roasted dark malts held together, some thick caramel and some molasses.  Then add a bar of black chocolate with high cacao content (80%+).  The dark fruits of the nose only start to show through the taste when the beer warmed-up.  That cacao and roastiness really dry the beer.  Some green hops.  Tasty bitterness feeling like biting a in a black chocolate bar while chewing a tiny bit of fresh green hops.

I had a roommate from OR who said that Deschutes was available in most gas stations & c-stores there...how wonderful that would be!  Far from the biggest and baddest in this style, but very nice.  Highly recommended.

Obsidian Stout pours the blackest of browns (if that makes any sense). Mahogany highlights only when held directly to the light and only creeping through the bottom of the glass. A strange looking big three finger tan head formed on the pour. I say strange because it was soapy looking and creamy at the same time. Very odd but definately a tasty looking stout. Leaves excellent lacing.

Unfortunately the nose seems to be lacking. Mild lightly roasted malts are there in the background but weak. Mild dark fruits, a lactic quality, and a pronounced metallic twang. If I smell deep I can pull out the aromas I like to expierence in a stout but theyre all just too weak and distant.

This is a quality stout. Roasted malts start things off with faint flavors of anise. Mild nuttiness mid-palate along with a creamy lactic quality. Nice balancing on the finish with bitter roasted malts and a touch of hop bitterness that make this smooth and exceptionally balanced.

Medium body with a slightly airy but creamy mouthfeel as it moves through the mouth. Nice lingering bitterness from a comonation of the hops and bitter malts.

This is a very good sessionable stout. Perfect beer to have on hand from Autumn through Winter if youre in the mood to sit down and have a few to warm up.

I believe this is only my second beer from Deschutes (the other being Black Butte Porter) and I wouldnt hesitate in buying either one of them again. Both very good examples in their respective styles.

478,"2007-09-13",4.8,"I picked his bottle up at a local store and decided it was time to try it. Here is my review:

Aroma: The aroma was of strong coffee and dark chocolate. No real hop aroma to be found.

Appearance: The brew poured into my glass a dark cola color. No ruby highlights could be seen on the sides. The head was a medium tan color and was about a finger width. Carbonation was very low to none.

Flavor: This brew tasted like coffee and roasted coffee beans. The taste has a bit of a ""bite"" to it, though after about two drinks, that goes away. The burnt coffee taste also shoots to the foreground and really sets this brews taste apart from others.

Mouthfeel: Not harsh nor bitter. No carbonation bite. Smooth and very very dark feeling.

Overall Impression: This is a damn fine example of a Master Brewer strutting his craft and knowing how to brew a craft beer. I really dont understand how some could give it such a low review as they have done...but to each his own...this is a dman fine brew.

The middle of the tongue picks up more roasted grain flavors (burnt toast, coffee) combined with hop flavors and sweet malts with a hint of caramel. The beer finishes with a touch fruit, lots of dark, roasted, bittersweet malts, and a light dose of hops. The mouthfeel is pleasantly creamy with just a subtle impression of acidity from the carbonation, and it finishes full in body. Overall, an awesome stout.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Head is fizzy as I pour, but it settles as a thick, lacing brown whipped cream on top of the blackness. Aroma is mild and sweet - but certainly not weak. There is a clear definition of cocoa, a touch of vanilla and distant coffee. I sense a touch of yeastyness coming through as well. I was initially surprised by the mouthfeels fizzyness, entering my mouth and dancing a little around on my tongue. But it soon settles and a distinct creamyness comes through. Flavour is quite dry, almost like taking a piece of dark chocolate and letting it melt in your mouth. The vanilla comes through the cocoa, roasted and mild coffee tones to balance it out nicely.

478,"2007-01-07",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 Heres a stout that can wake you up in the morning just as well as it can wake up your taste buds in the evening.  The namesake is abundantly appropriate.  The text on the side of the label cites an Obsidian flow near the brewery as the inspiration for the beer, and I have to heartily agree with the idea.  Holding this up to the light was a lesson in futility.  Only the reflection of the light off the glass produced any color.  Beyond the aquarium pane is a beer in total darkness.  Its subterranean in its closure to light, like a gaping fissure that consumes whatever falls into it without so much as a plink.  The only safeguard keeping me from falling in was a papyrus colored safety raft of a head, replete with honeycombing and thick lacing.  Had that not been there Im sure to have been mesmerized by the warping blackness and fallen in to a certain doom of indefinite temporal stasis.  Whole plantations worth of coffee gush out of the glass, choking my nose with an aroma Id likely only find at a coffee refinement plant.  Its huge, bold and sassy.  A dollop of dark honey whips and tames the beast a bit, giving the children something to enjoy, and a cursory handful of peat matures it a bit for more discerning beer connoisseurs.  I also noticed some molasses at play, as well as a sweet but savory Hoisin sauce element, and maybe something like plum or plum wine.  My culinary expertise is limited when it comes to China, leaving  me woefully unprepared to identify plum in all its gustatory greatness.  Despite these dripping, drooping flavors the body is very light and sporadic.  It leaps to the tongue with exuberance, spreading the good word of coffee and chocolate.  Then it fizzles like a firecracker as the sparks get dimmer and the whistles get softer, until it finally halts with a small wisp of smoke.  The final pop is a return to the peat in the aroma.  For the flavor profile it is an extremely strange dance, at first wildly assertive and then suddenly exhausted.  It ends not with a bang, but a whimper, so to speak.  Part of me wants to drink it really fast to keep up a circuit of intense flavor, while another part of me wants to sip it slowly and savor the quiet and smooth aftertaste.  That evidences the stylistic aptitude of this Obsidian Stout, which for the price is an excellent bargain, especially considering the company it would probably keep on the same shelf at the store.  Im glad to know that theres a dark beer unafraid to throw off its draconian palate to bust some moves and really engage the drinker.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
478,"2007-01-05",4.2,"Bottle.  Black body under a dense tan head leaving even coats of foam on the glass.  Great aroma - a complex mix of acidic roast malt, plum, and smoked fish.  Whereas the aroma gave you a balanced dose of roast and base sweetness the flavor focuses on roast malts.  However its not like munching on a handful of special roast - it has a certain mellowed out charcoal thing lacking a big acidic punch.  That fades away after the start exposing the underlying plum/raisin base which carries into the finish but not without lingering charcoal dust.  Medium mouthfeel.  Im really enjoying this stout because its not another fing dry stout - it strives for balance between sweetness and roast and does well at it.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"

478,"2006-12-20",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2007 Sampled on 11/29/2006 at the November meeting of the Junedale Beer Klub.  Brought by nordstrum...  

Tasting notes:  

Murky dark brown color with a light brown head.  Not much in the aroma and the flavor was fruity and yeasty.  Is had a slightly dry finish.  Rating: 6  3  5  3  12 = 2.9.

This was one of the stouts that I was really looking forward to trying, but was pretty disappointed.  However, I have a fresh bottle in the cellar that kenb sent to me, so I am really looking forward to trying this beer again and hopefully having a better tasting experience with it... -- 

UPDATE (12/22/2006):  I decided to get around to trying the bottle that bitbucket sent to me sooner rather than later...  Color in the glass is black (actual color of the beer when held up to the light is a clear, very dark mahogany color).  Th initial pour produces a very large, dense, whipped cream-like head that is tan in color.  It slowly collapses, but leaves a small residual head that has good lacing.  The aroma is roasted malt and semi-sweet chocolate morsels.  The flavor is robust and is roasted malt, semi-sweet chocolate, and a little bit of some char/burnt taste. The long roasty finish also has a burnt quality to it with a moderate amoung of bitterness to balance out this beer.  A nice, bitter, dark/semi-sweet chocolate flavor lingers.  This beer is medium to full bodied and has a nice silky smooth feel to it.  This bottle of Deschutes Obsidian Stout was much better then my first tasting experience and I am quite pleased.  This beer has lived up, if not exceeded, my original expectations.  New rating:  8  4  8  4  17 = 4.1.

(the rest i guzzled with my dinner. i can report it complimented my haricots provensal quite nicely). the beer of course is fairly dark, like something scraped off the bottom of coal-burning locomotive boiler. a sandpaper head rose in foamy castles with some rigidity-- like atlantis confident in its eternal and grand loft above the deep-- yet likewise it too sank. obsidian reeks of cola, raisins and plum jam, with coffee and raspberry sherbert and just a note of a smoldering cigarette on a hemp mat. a sweet, full-bodied stout with corpulent crowds of dark malts and fruity sour orange bitters rushing forward all at once to pack onto the modest elevator of my palate. some jostling occurs, but everyone gets to their corner and it seems balanced enough to lift me and my mood to higher levels.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

478,"2006-09-13",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2007 Black but penetrable by light. Gentle pour raises a lasting, chunky gray-tan mound of foam. Bottle conditioned. Pleasant aroma of black licorice, plums, and roasted barley. Buried notes of nougat. Feisty carbonation settles into a blanket of cream. Satiny body. Airy and sharply roasty initially, but fluffy nougat and a moist bed of roasted grains provide sweetness and structure. Relaxed fruity esters generate just enough vinous acidity to gently pucker the cheeks and spawn an onset of burnt malts. Char continues in its briskness as the high level of attenuation tickles the palate, stopping just shy of overwhelming the nuanced malt. Despite the abundance of dry char, it finishes chewy with nougat, salty licorice, and smoky whispers of roast. Disappointing but typical that their slowest seller happens to be their most flavorsome  offering. A very solid stout.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

478,"2006-03-07",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2010 Pours as black as black can be, with a dark tan, pillowy head that you would expect from an imperial.  Nose is heavily of roasted coffee, and cedar hops, faint chocolate.  Palate is a lively carbonation with an almost chewy, creamy texture and medium-full body.  Maybe a little more carbonated than I would like.  The roasted coffee is still very prominent (moreso than some coffee Ive had!), with a dark chocolate flavor showing through.  A moderate hop bitterness balances the stout well.  Finishes with the bitter sweet chocolate taste and the hop bitterness showing heavily through.  This reminds me a lot of a small imperial without the alcohol taste and without the complexity.  The only thing I think this beer really lacks is some other malt flavor to back up the chocolate and roasted coffee.  Nonetheless, one of the most interesting stouts you will try; and definitely at least worth the try.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

478,"2006-01-05",3.9,"Best before 2/10/2006 bottle sampled with OldGrowth on 1/1/2006.  Transluscent, deep coal brown, moderate tan head with good retention, though it is not overly fluffy or full.  Licorice, barley, and a touch of coffee begin to emanate from the glass, but are lost amid a dry, bitter, dulling black-patent malt-like note.  Seems to weaken the aroma.  No hops or yeast present either.  Fortunately, the flavor seems nothing like the aroma (oddly enough), bringing creamy coffee to the table, with light caramel and playful acidity from the roast.  Medium body overall, with a silky texture.  Chocolatey and creamy, with all of your stout flavors, yet not overdone.  Very low hop apparency, no fruitiness.  Easy drinking, yet by no means simple and obsolete.  It brings a richness of flavor, with no alcohol apparency, that few stouts of this gravity are able to match these days.  Hell, there just arent many of these being made any more.  Refreshing and drinkable without comprimising flavor is a fantastic trait (if I may interject my opinion) that more beers need to have.  Barley flakes, light choco-coffee notes and low to moderate carbonation which is relatively unnoticed.  If I could just get a little more out of the aroma. . . .","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Pours a deep black color and is topped by a three-finger thick, light brown colored head that slowly recedes in a large bubbled mass.  The aroma is dominated by roasted notes; I get notes of deeply roasted espresso, acidic notes of cold black coffee, and some sweet dark chocolate aromatics up front.  The aroma is quite nice.

The taste is sharp, with a burnt acidity to it up front.  This is balanced by a soft creamy mouthfeel that starts in the middle and carries through almost to the end.  The finish is dominated by roasted notes quite similar to the finish of an espresso; acidity and roasted / burnt notes.  For all of the roast character it is quite smooth, it is lack that burnt-husk astringency that can be found in some stouts.  Having said that, the roasted acidity here is a bit too much; there needs to be a bit more something (sweet malt would do it) to balance it out.  Perhaps a bit of age would do the trick as well; I have a feeling this might mellow out over 6 months or so.

478,"2004-12-19",4.2,"This beer pours a dark brown to black color with a thick carbonated brown/tanned head...absolutely massive! It dissipates rather quickly and left little lacing. The aroma is strong and enticing. Surprisingly complex aroma with strong hops, citrusy notes, nuts, cotton, wood, twigs, cocoa and chocolate. The flavor is surprisingly equally complex. Theres almost a little trace presence of alcohol in the finish with a thick chocolate tongue coating front and a slight bittersweet hop and butterscotch syrupy finish. Definitely a wood/nutty type deal going on here that makes this beer truly interesting. Full bodied, light carbonation, and truly one of the best stouts Ive tried to date...though itd be unfair to admit that I really do love stouts.

Of course it poured dark obsidian, with a thin dense brown head sitting on top, and I could see some sediment on the sides of the glass.  No highlights when head to the light, this beer is dark.  Aroma is when you put a camp fire out with a bucket of water, roasty, earthy, and a little musty (in a good way).  Also hinds of licorice and smoke in the aroma.

The aroma weighed heavily on the chocolate/coffee side with some sense of the alcohol though not intrusive except on close inspection.  The flavor then leaned more heavily in the direction of the roasted, with a moderate bitterness that reminds me this is a Northwest US beer.  The mouthfeel didn't overwhelm me--solid enough, but only average.

Aroma has a soft bakers chocolate and a good load of dry coffee thats well rounded and quite roasty, nearly burnt. Taste is quite roasty as well, burntish dark malts, slight coffee tone, slight bittering, all gaining a bit more in the finish which is nice. Finish builds with an overall burntness with touches of coffee and bitterness, turning dry and fading off slowly leaving more bittering coffee notes and later still, some chocolate. Nice finisher. Feel is just past medium body, nearly full with a solid carbonation and pretty strong with its drying efforts where burntness and coffee sensations really take hold.

Out-fricking-standing.

I went to a bar tonight, which I rarely do, and I noticed some writing on the Obsidian Stout handle that the bottles didn't have. I looked closer and noticed that it had ""NITRO"" in big red letters across the handle. Deschutes is my favorite brewery anyway, so I had to give it a shot. I couldn't be more glad that I did. 

Please note that this review is primarily comparing this version to the bottled version, so if you want to read my full review, scroll down a bit. This is everything the bottle gives and more.

Deep black pour with an incredibly fine and thick head. It didn't leave lace, it left a sheet behind on the glass. The scent was a bit more subdued than the bottled version but it was still excellent. Tasted heavenly, of course, since I don't think Deschutes could make a bad beer if they tried.

478,"2002-04-07",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2004 When I first had this beer in high school, I didn't understand how people could drink it. I have now come to understand why as I have matured- this stuff is great. ReRate 2004. Aged one year. This mellowed out considerably, still has a great roasty taste, full body, all that.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
478,"2002-04-03",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2009 A beautiful stout that is rich in taste.  Just the right balance of everything.  Probably the best american stout Ive tried in my few short months since becoming legal to drink.","San Diego, California, USA","Sickboy282"

478,"2001-08-17",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2003 Maybe if I drank it during the cold winter months my rating would be higher, but a stout in mid August just doesn't hit the spot.","Sisters, Oregon, USA","Zach Diesel"

478,"2001-05-27",3.3,"An easy-going stout. I would have liked to have seen it more assertive and flavor-packed.  Certainly not bad, but Id say this in the bottom half of this brewerys line of beer.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
478,"2001-05-27",3.9,"Thick dark black brew with mild roastiness but good dark malt bite.  A semi-sweet stout with noticeable PNW hopping.  Excellent on tap ....in a bottle it loses a lot of its luster.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","Stove Top"

478,"2001-03-17",3.4,"Ive only had one of these (brought back to me from a friend on vacation), so I am prbably not qualified to comment.  It was a nice, stout-esque beer.  A little too watery for my taste.  A bit like Sam Adams, but with a little more flavor.  If you live where you can get it, give it a whirl!","USA","StoutOrDeath"
478,"2000-12-10",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2003 The most beauteous thing in the world is a Stout setting in its Chalice, that magnificent ebony color crowned by a thick head all chocolate brown, frothy and the left over lace a nice sealing sheet upon the glass. Toasted grains, Starbucks coffee, bittersweet chocolate, sweet and inviting, as is the malt-laden start and the top thick and chewy. Finish has a spicy hop bite, moderately acidic, bittersweet chocolate dry and a real treat to the palate and a top notch Stout in my book.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
478,"2000-11-29",4.3,"This is one of my favorite stouts.  Its fairly strong as far as alcohol percentage goes.  Its got everything I look for in a stout...its roasty, chewy, and got some sweetness to boot.  A great beer for sure!  Black as night.","Sandy, Utah, USA","opiate"
