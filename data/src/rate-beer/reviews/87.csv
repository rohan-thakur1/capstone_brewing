 Dodatki:  Biała szałwia, kminek, owoce jałowca, kasztany. 
 Kolor:  Rubinowy. Pod światło liczne czerwonawe refleksy. Silna opalizacja. 
 Piana:  Żółta, drobnopęcherzykowa, przechodząca w średnie oczka.

 Zapach:  Umiarkowanie mocny słodkawy zapach. Początkowo delikatna czekolada, trochę kawy Cafe Latte. Z oddali dochodzą przyprawowo-ziołowe nuty - trochę jałowca i kasztany. Dość specyficzny zapach, ale na tyle lekki, że nie zaburza całościowego odbioru. 
 Smak:  W smaku na pierwszy ogień idą słody. Przede wszystkim zaznacza się czekolada deserowa, która wykleja usta swoją słodyczą. Po chwili do kubków smakowych dociera smak jałowca, lekkie kasztanowe sugestie i coś bardziej ziołowego - to może być szałwia. W oddali ciemne owoce - śliwki, ciemne winogrona, rodzynki.
Goryczka silnie zaznaczona, średniej długości.

87,"2013-12-25",3.9,"Dark brown body with a tiny head, ok lacing. Rather strong aroma with caramel, herbs, juniper berries and spices, also port wine, burnt sugar and brown sugar. Very sweet taste. Even though there are not much bitterness to balance, the sweetness, the spices ensure that the beer is not cloying. Maybe its because Im Norwegian, but I find the Norwegian contribution to the spice mix, the juniper berries, to be much more obvious than white sage and chestnuts. On the other hand Im not that familiar with the two latter ingredients, so they may be in there as well, as the stuff Ive labelled ""herbs"" and ""spices"" in my tasting notes. I also get caraway, anise seeds, dark caramel and hints of chocolate. Amazing mouthfeel, its the most creamy and smooth texture Ive ever experienced! The body is full and the carbonation is very soft. A wonderful beer!

The flavor is pretty spicy, not unbearable but pretty focused around the sage and the juniper. Its got a nice sweetness & a cool brown sugar & toffee character. Its honestly a little sweeter than Id like it to be, but its got the spicy christmastime dessert thing in the bag for sure.

87,"2013-04-05",3.4,"500ml bottle. Pours an opaque deep chestnut, with a small beige head, which lasts reasonably well, but does not leave that much lacing. There is a pronounced gin-like aroma, mingled with roasted chestnuts, carraway and the faintest hint of rye bread malt. Sage is the initial flavour, with some peppery hops coming in. A touch of carraway and strong juniper lead into a blend of chestnut and roasty malt in the mid-palate. More juniper, chestnuts and bittersweet chocolate malt create the finish, and there is a gin aftertaste. This is definitely one of the stranger beers I have had for a while. Bizarrely it all works fairly well, despite its odd range of ingredients. The sage and carraway complement the hops, and the chestnuts work brilliantly with the dark, bittersweet malt flavours. The juniper is, however, a little too strong; it dominates proceedings a little. On the whole, though, this is a weird but enjoyable beer.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

87,"2012-09-16",2.9,"Bottle shared by Thorpe429 at the Christmas in July party. Thanks Mike!

The beer is brown, with a small head that fades rapidly, leaving minimal lacing. The aroma is grandiose, with pine, Christmas spices, and alcohol. The flavor brings a huge pine needle flavor, like drinking Christmas tree juice with cinnamon and nutmeg sprinkled on top. The body is thin, and the flavor, while decent, is overbearing. I would prefer more balance and subtlety. A small portion was more than enough for me.

S-- All over the place. Vanilla, Cinnamon, Juniper berry. Smells more like a big spicy vanilla candle that you light at Christmas. Really good nose.

T-- A lot of vanilla, juniper, and sage. Cinnamon and the malt are in the background. A lot of flavor in this and the juniper berries and sage really stand out. Spice with a lot of flavor.

M-- Pretty high carbonation but works well for what is in it and what it is. The amount of spices have a numbing effect on my tongue and in effect have killed the taste buds. After it warms up more it tastes more the chestnuts come out more and leave a big nutty flavor and the beer becomes more alcoholic.

Appearance - Pours a ruby/mahogany color with a thin tan head which settles quickly. Nice clarity. Good lacing. A fluffy head forms in the bottle as it waits for the next person to have a pour.

Aroma - Right of the bat I can detect a difference with this beer from the Stone version.  Where Stones level of spice was what I would describe as hard this one is more smooth.  I wonder if it is an age issue. I like the more tame aroma.

Mouthfeel - Medium level of carbonation. Definitely more carbonated then the Stone version which really works for the beer.

Taste - No hops to balance out the high level of spices. Very malty. No Rye. The juniper is more tame then the Stone version.  Does a great job in covering up the 9% abv in the beer.

The aroma is rich and robust with a mixture of different elements that confuses my nose, and only because it was mentioned on the bottle, did I agree with the sage and juniper berries, but there is also minor syrup like scent and a worthy salivating smokiness in the faint background.

87,"2011-02-26",3.3,"Bottle and served in NB Worthy glass next to my remaining bottle of  Stone/Nøgne Ø/JP Special Holiday Ale (which already rated at 4.0 previously, but will rerate at 3.7) and the JP/Nøgne Ø/Stone Collababeire Special Holiday Ale: Deep chestnut brown with a fading but lasting off-white creamy head and good lace. The aroma has notes of chestnut, roast, sage, juniper, gin, clean oak, honeycomb, and some very earthy and almost leathery ester. The taste starts quite spicy and pretty much stays the course. The sage and juniper intermix produces an almost piney character similar to Stone bottled version. But unlike the Stone version, this is much more malty and less bitter and astrengent... which is not a good thing. Sure is very holiday like, but is too much of a good thing IMO, If Tom thought that the Stone version was too much he would really hate this one. The mouth feel of this brew is actually the best of the lot, nearly full-bodied, dry but oily too. The alcohol seems least noticeable in the beer as well.  Of the three versions, this is my least favorite because it is the least balanced nor complex. (note that the oldest Stone released version is going a tad downhill and I would likely give it only a 3.7 rating now)","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

This blends well with a cocoa powder in the background that gives me an all around mouthfeel that reminds of a spiced cocoa on a cold winters day. The cocoa taste last long into the finish, giving the beer a pleasant lingering sensation. I get more of a light to medium bodied creamy and milky mouthfeel.

87,"2011-01-28",3.2,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2011 In short: A straightforward toasted, sweet and nutty dark ale.  A bit boring.
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed when approximately one year of age.  Bottle sent to me by  brewolf? (not sure about this one)
The look: Very dark brown body topped by a very small dark beige head
In long: Nose of roasted nuts, wood coal.  Taste of burnt brown sugar, nutty caramel fudge, tree bark, spicy notes, some bananas, some floral notes.  Supposed to used berries but I didnt find much berries at and not much fruity flavors for that matter.  It might because of the age difference (I had the Stone version fresher) but I found this Nogne version simpler with all th focus on plain sweet nutty malts.  I thought the first version (Stone) was a bit odd and find this second version a bit bland.  Basically they are both just ok beer for different reasons.  Im not sure if these will be made again but they were not interesting enough so Im not planning to re-rate them.  Anyway in fifty years from now none of my ratings are really going to matter,  mostly because of the fact that none of them really matter now.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Quite a bit of roasted malts and berry sweetness (a cherry flavor comes through, even though I dont believe cherries were used in the brewing), alongside flavors from the aroma.

Very spicey on the palate and a strong dry hoppiness on the palate.  Some chocolate malt coming through as well as a hint of mocha.  The finish is rather bitter and dry from the hops.

87,"2010-12-18",3.7,"Bottle; Pour is a dark brown with light beige head. Rims the glass, with decent retention. The sage does dominate here. That in itself is different ; without reading the bottle, I thought at first when sampling this brew that I was pulling nutmeg out of it , but I think it is more a combination of the sage and the juniper berries. There is a general spiciness in this brew on the tongue and the bitterness is present here as well. You do get a bit of sweetness from the malts - and it seems a bit boozy, for whatever reason. Im trying my hardest to sense the chestnuts in this brew and it was only at the very end of the flavor profile that it finally came out - it took quite a while really, and so I would call that element subdued and wouldnt have known it if I were tasting this blindly.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

Flavor is also quite herbal (even kind of medicinal) with more sage, juniper, and spruce.  After the initial herbal tastes, a more malty presence is noticeable with notes of chocolate, rye bread, caramel, and maple.  Nice creamy mouthfeel with lightly bitter-medicinal finish.  It definitely smells and tastes like a good holiday ale, but Im not sure if I could drink this more than once a year.

87,"2010-08-29",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Raisins, juniper and spiced bread notes adorn this full-bodied yet effervescent dessert brew.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam floats atop the cloudy dark brown. There is too much yeast in the bottle to my liking.
-Mild citrusy tartness is found in the last half of each sip.
-The finish is not cloying at all, which often happens in these Christmasy spiced ales.
-The yeast gets in the way of the flavor even if you are careful not to include any in your glass.

A juniper-like touch also chimes in, along with roasted malts, dired fruits, caramel and little touch of molasses or some other dark sugar. Its full-bodied and almost sticky sweet, but with enough alcohol and bitterness to cope with it. At least as a beer for the darker, colder months. Theres licorice and juniper berries too in the flavor, and a fine bitterness to finish it.

87,"2010-04-17",3.8,"50cl bottle.   Im wondering how the exact recipe differs in this version compared to the Stone version, as they both use the same yeast strain from what I have heard.   Water is the main suspect here, but I would guess that base malt is probably different, with Nogne using marris otter in all of their beers from what I have heard the brewer say.Then of course you are brewing on a much smaller system in this case...Well, the beer pours a dark brown color with a medium sized beige head with creamy texture and good retention.   The aroma has a punchy rye bread character with juniper and sage being immediately apparent as well.   Almost like a creamy, spiced coffee cake with a dusting of cocoa powder.   The sage in particular strikes a nice chord, but maybe thats just because its my local ingredient.   I just love walking into a garden with sage bushes in it.   The flavor starts out with some caramel sweetness and chocolate cake, and transitions in to a dryer chocolate finish that is also a little nutty and earthy.   Rye shows in the finish, and the spices come through all around.   Soft, almost moussey carbonation.   I like how this starts out a little on the sweet side and then the finish gets dry with spiced chocolate.

87,"2010-04-05",4.0,"Finally decided to purchase the bottled (exactly as pictured) at Greens on Ponce De Leon. Fluffy head at first, but the head recedes quickly. The appearance is rather nice; the dark brown, nearly black body looks wonderful. The beer is almost opaque, but seems to me to be rather translucent i.e. some light is poking its way through. A little bit of head retention would have forced me to give this a perfect score for appearance. Juniper is nice and strong as it was in the last collaboration amongst these brewers. The sage is immediately noticeable. In my mind, the sage and juniper dominate the aroma, and mix very well together. Some sweet aromas are popping through, but it is very arduous to detect them.  I would like have this side-by-side with the previous years collaboration. I feel this one has a different malt character to it. Caramel malts are poking through, or so it seems. The juniper and sage are definitely there, and are offering an extremely nice spice flavor. I feel as though the malt sweetness and a touch of hop bitterness are what is different in this years (I guess I should say last years) collaboration. The more obvious malt presence seems to give it a ""richer"" texture. Shit, I think I am detecting some roast flavor in this as well. Hmmm...I like the texture a little bit better than the previous collaboration, but for some reason I am thinking I enjoyed the other one a little bit more. I enjoy the sage and juniper, but it doesnt feel completely right for some reason. Still, a damn fine spice and herb beer.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

Very silky and smooth, super-creamy. Aroma is a strong gust of sage dust and juniper. I find the combination to smell a bit of male deodorant and like fake fragrances found in many cleaning products. The flavor is a subtler version, with a rather wet, but not sticky, palate. Somehow, it tastes a bit like a ginger barleywine, but with an amplified edge of sage.

A little better then I remember the first rendition. I am most excited about JPs soured version if the rumors are true!","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"
87,"2010-02-19",4.0,"Thanks Chuck.  The beer pours to a deep black mahogany/ruby body with a thin but coating off-white head.  The aroma is quite balanced.  I never would expect that sage, chestnuts, and juniper berries would work together.  The sage comes off sweet and blended with the juniper smells almost like thyme and oregano.  The flavor seems pretty chocolate-like with a nice sweet herbal compound.  The finishing flavor of the beer seems to have some nuttiness which could likely only be the chestnuts.  The palate is kind of dry stout like.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"

87,"2010-02-18",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2013 I really believe Nogne O churned out the best holiday ale Ive ever had.  Pours a fairly deep brown and produces a large head.  Tastes of juniper and just the right amount of spices--perhaps a bit of nutmeg, ginger, cloves and maybe cinnamon--this stuff tastes like Christmas. Wonderful beer that, without hesitation, Id take even over my preferred holiday ale, the Great Lakes Christmas Ale. EDIT: After drinking Nogne Os second iteration of this brew, Im downgrading my rating.  I still really love this mahogany christmas ale, but find the juniper berry component a bit overpowering.  It presents an evergreen aspect that, unlike in a piney IPA, comes across as somewhat Vaseline-like initially, although the aftertaste seems more balanced.  I still like it, and it is definitely among the best holiday ales Ive had, but it isnt worthy of the high 4.4 rating I initially gave it back in 2008/2009.","Connecticut, USA","sepia5"

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a very dark crimson and looked nearly brown in the glass with red highlights. It had and average to large, tan head that kept a nice sheet and left fair lacing. The aroma was moderate caramel malt; with a hint of chocolate; pepper, licorice, cola, spices, cherry cola and spruce. The initial flavor was sweet, lightly bitter and acidic; while the finish was rather sweet and lightly bitter with a fairly long duration. There was juniper, spices, toffee, nutty manlts, more spices, more fruit, pine (but not pine hops) like spruce, licorice, pepper, cola; and once the yeast was added there was a little more nutty malts and slight chocolate. The medium to full body was sort of silky and then rather dry with soft, yet tingly carbonation and a dry and slightly alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

87,"2010-02-13",3.4,"I am just realizing the concept behind this beer so had to check my last rating of version one from stone. This version seems to be much more dependant on the juniper berries as last years was much more hop dominant. Distinct yeast presence gives the flavor a wildness that is a little more pronounced than I remember as well. Fruity finish and sweetness that lasts a while. Very seasonal so dont hold on to this one for too long. A uniquely spicey berry and pine aroma.

The flavor starts with the aroma traits, but the malt is more prevalent to balance out the spices and chestnut shows through  especially on the finish.

The second of three releases this is on par with last years release.  I look forward to the final contribution to the series to see if the one sitting in Dexter lives up to its previous two counterparts.  Check this out while it is still on the shelf.  Despite being a little on the pricey side it is worth the cost even if you only buy a single bottle.

Aroma / Appearance - The nice off-white half finger head lived for a few minutes atop the maroon base.  Infused with a black darkness it glowed in the firelight.  Yeast, cherry, nutmeg, and junipers give this a kick that makes one feel as if they are under a Christmas tree.  It does pack a punch so be prepared.

Flavor / Palate - Juniper and sprig starts the show but before long it turns into a completely different beast.  Licorice and anise come along for the ride.  There is a slightly medicinal tinge to the finish that is distracting.  Otherwise this is solid, well rounded, and it was a disappointment when the bottle finally kicked.  If I did have another bottle I would probably give it another six months to mellow out before opening it.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
87,"2010-01-23",3.6,"It is interesting how different this beer is from the one brewed at Stone - the hops are definitely more subdued, allowing the other spices and herbs to become more prominent - the nose is loaded with sage and juniper - the chestnuts are very potent in the flavor, and the sage really produces a minty, cooling quality on the tongue - juniper sits on top of moderate caramel maltiness - a touch of tartness on the back end, and some roasted nut quality - lingering sage and mint - much more subtle than the Stone version, but still full of flavor - I like it!","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

Seriously, those words hit the nose nail on the head.    First impressions are a thin, extremely watery overall feel to the beer with light, almost essence-like flavors of mint, chocolate, roasted barley, halls cough drops, and caraway seeds.  The finish has a balancing, crisp, and forward hop presence.  This is an extremely interesting beer...The way the flavors are off in the distance with the medicinal edge subtly not so subtle..what I thought was a watery texture at first really isnt so watery...the body is actually quite medium...its just like a coat of gloss over the medicinal, minty, chocolaty flavors that confuses, yet entices.  Seriously, I dont know what part Stone had in the production of this specific beer...but it could possibly be the best beer theyve had their name on in eons.  I am certainly an opponent of most spices in beer, but every blue moon someone seems to combine the right amount and right kinds of spices to produce something that just plain works.  This is one of those blue moon moments.  I need to try the one with Stone named first...if they used their own yeast as I have read, I guarantee that it sucks and is the perfect proof I need to show the world.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"

I dont know if this is a trend, or a resurgence, or whats up, but add this to the list of very enjoyable spice-herb beers Ive picked up recently.  Maybe its a Scandinavian thing, but there was a hot second about five years ago where it seemed related beers might be gaining some footing (sahti, Heavyweight Jåkeldrickå, others) using spruce, juniper, herbs, etc.  But then that gave way to more mediocre imperial stouts and ipas, and creativity once again went by the wayside.  Well what a coup for one of the biggest offenders (albeit a favorite brewer) in Stone to be one of the few generally available US brewers to get on board.  Now Im just rambling.  Lovely stuff, dark brown, hazed, with lasting tan head.  Aroma is mild and suggests sweetness, almost like an herb tea but with some cocoa notes and mild roasted squash.  Body is a tad heavy and sweet, but definitely not cloying, with a nice woody acidic bitterness on the back of the palate.  Flavor adds some root beer, mint (must be the sage), cool juniper.  Very enjoyable brew, but a bit on the sweet and heavy side all around.  I guess the excuse could be that it it supposed to be a winter beer, but Iike to see a dryer beer more pronounced adjuncts in this case.  That sweetness knocks it a few steps behind some of the more refined beers done in a similar style, such as the Norrebro Old Odense.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

Lovely smooth palate, but nice carbonation. Mellow roast in the taste, touch of dustiness, hint of spice. Feel gives a nice tingle, more from ginger and burntness than the carbonation. Roast becomes fuller and richer after swallowing, its lovely and toasty and roasty. Spicing has almost totally gone, it just subtly complements the rich roast, rather than dominating.

The palate is full and silky smooth with lively carbonation. The finish is long with lingering spices and a it of sourness. Overall: A very tasty ale.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"

87,"2010-01-03",3.7,"0.5L bottle. Pours a brown-amber colored body with a finger-width, creamy, tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is fairly sweet caramels with a nice spicing and noticable berry, currant smell. Nutty, some yeast, and a bit metallic with a light, almost minty hop. A little bit of maple and chocolate accompanies the caramels too. Flavor is quite nice. Again, there is a good amount of rich, sweeter malts that give off more of a chocolate flavor than the aroma. The nuts are lightly toasted and there is still a touch of maple. All this balances nicely with a good amount of holiday spices and a light berry fruit. Finishes with a lightly smoked chocolate and a woody bitterness. Lingers for a moderate duration after a medium to full, slightly chewy body. Overall, another solid beer from the trio. This one seems a bit sweeter than last years version, but still maintains a balanced spiciness and toasted nuttiness. No complaints here.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Juniper berries add a very unique taste.  Sage and mint are present too.  Toasted rye and roasted coffee flavors follow.  There is a subtle, roasty nuttiness underneath.  Mandarin oranges and some grapefruits finish things off with a dryness that hangs around for a bit.  Warming alcohol is present throughout and only adds to the complexity.  A bit different than last years version brewed by Stone (the juniper berries are definitely accentuated this year), but no less impressive.","Washington DC, USA","lamas"

Flavor followed, a tad medicinal/cough syrupey, some light chocolate/cocoa, birch/cola, a touch of citrus. As with last years, where is JP on this production?

Pours an amberish brown body with an aroma that envelopes the nostrils with a hspice rack of herbs and sassafrass root. The spice continues in the flavor, where sage, subtle nutmeg, pine sap, coriander, biscuit notes, and an aftertaste of cola all intermingle. Medium carbonation and full body.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety/creamy texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Interesting evidence that the brewer alone can make a significant difference...Stones version of this recipe was pretty disappointing, mostly in the aroma department.

Smooth and mouth filling flavour of dried fruits like prunes mingled with spicy, tart berries added by bready, semi-sweet malts behind. Bitter coffee notes towards the ending along with more bitter berries and fruit. Full bodied and a bit foamy on the swallow.

87,"2009-12-24",3.8,"Thanks to my Secret Santa for sending this collab my way! Id very much enjoyed the 2008 version, and this modest variation is another enjoyable brew. Pours cloudy and almost milky, with an oily scrim of foam on top of a beer that couldve been unearthed from some Viking burial mound. The nose is quite distinctive, with the sage and juniper blending very sharply to give it an almost mentholated quality. Sharper taste becomes quickly apparent, almost as if there is some spruce here as well (which there apparently isnt), and the deep brown is mellowed out by the lovely chestnut taste. Finish is oddly abrupt in its dryness. Overall, a goodern.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

87,"2009-12-23",3.7,"Pours an extremely dark chestnut brown color, showing glints of crimson at the edges when backlit. A tall, dense head of spongy, dark tan foam displays excellent retention, sticking around for ages and leaving thick sheets of lacing all over the glass.  The nose is Christmas in a nutshell. Aromas of rich, dry cocoa and warmed caramel are spiced beautifully with roasted chestnuts, fresh juniper, earthy allspice, and brown tea leaves. Hints of minty spruce are also strong and inviting. Flavors are considerably more malty than in the first batch, both cocoa and roasty chestnuts showing considerably more prominently than I recall. Juniper lends that sprucey, minty note, while dark winter spices offer countering, eathen bitterness. A touch of vanilla finishes things off nicely.  The palate is moderately substantive, showing a little bit of creamy roundness up front that transitions into a spicy, drying bitterness on the back end. Id say that I like this Nøgne Ø brewed version a little better than the Stone batch, as it seems a little more balanced and bigger in mouthfeel.

Palate is a bit of let down with a smooth and silky texture but not quite medium and nearly soft.  Finishes with minimal sweetness and only less-than-moderate bitterness but notes of sage, light rye spice, faint resins, and lingering chestnuts.  From the start, I thought I would like this one better than last years version from Stone with the Grimstad head and the rich and fruity nose.  But the sweetness diminishes quickly in the flavor and the nice chestnut notes seem to dominate the finish.  The beer is incredibly drinkable, just like last year, which does make for a likable beer but just so dominated by the spices.  Nice offering from three great breweries; I am looking forward to next years at JP.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Label reading convinces me that maybe it is juniper and sage, but it had me going there for a second. Body is a leathery dark brown with a decent tan head that continues to rise for a half minute or so after pour is finished. Flavor is about like my initial assessment of the nose: chocolate and mint.

87,"2009-12-07",3.8,"500mL bottle poured into a tulip.

Pours a dark, dark brown out of the bottle and sits almost black in the glass with hints of mahogany around the edges.  There is a tight, thick beige head that shows very good retention and some legs on the sides.

The aroma is dominated by the spices and juniper, with an almost minty character in the nose.  There isnt much of the underlying malts or rye.

The taste is much better and shows a complexity that I think the aroma lacks.  The initial taste is dark roasted malts with the juniper coming out right after.  The finish starts with a smooth spicy rye with some sage as well.

The mouthfeel is on the fuller side of things and extremely smooth with the rye doing its thing.  The carbonation is soft but full of tiny bubbles on the palate.

I think this is a tad better than last years version, though they are certainly very close.  The aroma is a bit spicy for me but the taste is excellent, as is the super creamy mouthfeel.  Creative and tasty.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Theres spruce, cardamon, honey, chocolate and possibly some nutmeg in there, too.  The taste at first is bewildering, but after the initial realization that its an extremely unusual beer, the glass is hard to put down.  Taste is primarily cardamon, but also a bit of menthol, some alcohol, bitter chocolate, and grapefruit hop.  The taste keeps changing and the flavor lingers.","Portland, Oregon, USA","gracefullypunk"

Nov 2009: On tap at Olympen, Oslo. Dark brown colour. Astonishing menthol/medicinal aroma - certainly peculiar. Rich taste of menthol, forest fruits, licquorice, malts.
