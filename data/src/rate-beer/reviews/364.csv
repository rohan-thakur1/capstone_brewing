Very nice, actually, but this pricepoint - just as the BIIR geuze - is rediculous ( it sells for in between 20 and 30  in Belgian beershops, whilst a top-class geuze like 3f sells for about 10. Id happily drink again, but I have questions about whod actually buy it at this price. Another thing is that ill never see this being sold in a bar- its simply way to expensive. Try 1/3 - 1/4th of the price and well talk again.","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

364,"2017-03-04",4.1,"ACBF 2017. Thank you for sharing kraddel, tderoeck, Travlr & friends. 750 ml. bottle sampled. Hazy orange, creamy white head. Nose is what it should be, bright lambiek funk, dry, faintly rustic, raw grains, dry pepper, crisp. Too bad that the taste doesnt fully deliver. Taste is bit malty upfront, falls bit flat, basic lemon, citrus, mellow, low sourness, almost faint sugar, lower on the side of funk, mellow horseblanket with clear malt,... faintly empty. Body is lightly empty, low sourness, clear malts, not as crispy as hoped. Overall good but there is better within the style, personally I liked the BIIR Gueuze a lot more which came from the same stable.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
