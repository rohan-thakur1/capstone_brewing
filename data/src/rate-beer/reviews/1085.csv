1085,"2013-08-04",4.3,"Dobry cydr z gruszkowego sfermentowanego soku. Chyba jeden z najlepszych jakie pilem w tym gatunku. Polecam kazdemu. Ciemno zoltawa barwa i wyrazny aromat swiezych gruszek, a w smaku juz jakby stare ulegalki. Gruszkowa soczystosc i slodkosc guruje tu nad wszelkimi innymi smakami. Male nagazowanie i niewielka piana.
