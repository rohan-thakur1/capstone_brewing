714,"2016-10-10",3.8,"Aroma - has a little oakiness, some piney and pungent hop oil, with a touch of caramel.
Appearance - the body is a hazy amber, and the head is beige and 1"". The head just sits and sits, hardly ever dissipating. Not much lacing, but some.
Taste - is a rye malt, with Pacific Northwest variety hops. Mostly of a spruce nature, there is also some pungency. Seems like a meeting of the 3 Cs - Columbia, Centennial, and Cascade. Balance is very nice, there is also a bit of caramel and some woodiness.
Palate - medium body, texture is very smooth - not oily, carbonation is average, and the finish is slightly bitter and pungent. Finish is of a medium length.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"

Was looking forward to this one. Decided if I liked it enough, I might even take a 4-pack home, but it would have to be better than Elevated IPA (it wasnt). First time I have heard of this one. 

Poured an auburn, caramel, clear color with two fingers of khaki tan, frothy head. Light bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Very good amount of semi-layered foamy lacing. Good retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled floral hops, Citra, orange blossom, caramel, rye, sweetened iced tea and peach. (Smell - 4.25)

Tasted rye, caramel, sweetened iced tea, Citra, floral, caramel, earthy, slight nuts and toffee. (Taste - 4.00)

Medium body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long finish. (Overall - 4.00)

Liked this one a lot, probably more than I even thought. Would like to try it again some time. (Overall - 4.00)

714,"2016-04-06",4.1,"An amazing pour, from the can into a porter glass despite the request of a tumbler. Watching the liquid cascade into itself is like watching honey being decanted into the glass, then into the pillowy, soft foam that rises aggressively at the surface.
- The aroma is spicy with rye and malts, but the flavor is hops bold as well. As the head diminishes, the aroma becomes larger; caramel, biscuit and edgy rye spice with a mild and dreamy addition of clover in the flavor. Massive in experience, every attribute is delectable, from the moderate body to the mild and lightly bitter body.
-The lacing on the glass as I swallow the last bits of this delicious brew is consistent and gorgeous from the lip of the glass to the base, and if there was no reason to visit New Mexico before, there is nothing that could keep me away now. This is beautiful from aroma to finish. Ill be planning a vacation...when is the weather perfect in New Mexico?","USA","lightbias"
714,"2016-03-26",2.8,"Can.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing.
Body is dark amber.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (caramel, toasted grain/seeds), moderately to heavily hoppy (resin, grapefruit), with a note of gum.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately to heavily bitter.

Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic, lightly to moderately astringent. 

A bit of a resin bomb, not a whole lot going on in the nose besides that, but its ok. Both too sour and too bitter in the mouth, and the astringency doesnt help either...unbalanced and brutish and thus hard to enjoy drinking very much. Not very good, with no elegance or finesse, just another ""quantity over quality"" overhopped American amber ale.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
714,"2016-03-22",3.9,"Can. Incredibly bright pine needles and wet grass in the nose, backed up by caramel and toasted rye. Flavor is a similar hop bomb: piney, floral, grapefruity goodness. Dry biscuits, sharp rye, and just enough dark malt sugars balance things out. Peppery hop resins dig into the tongue at the finish; moderate bitterness grips the back. Really great.","","PartyFowle"
714,"2016-03-22",3.9,"Pours reddish copper. Nose is citrus and floral hops with sone caramel malts. Taste follows. Very drinkable with great balance. Like a West Coast IPA with a nice malt backbone.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"
714,"2016-03-16",3.9,"Can from wchesser -- cheers! This is interesting -- its both a malt bomb and a hop bomb, if thats even possible. The malt backbone is grainy and rustic from what Im guessing is mountains of rye malt, with some caramel sweetness too. Then theres a lot of general hop aroma towards the end that would probably taste a lot like an IPA if it wasnt for the lingering rye flavor. Great rye beer!","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
714,"2016-03-12",3.7,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a dark red with a thick off white head. Aroma of earthy hops, rye spices, bitter hops, caramel malt. Flavor of rich malt, earthy malt, rye spices, citrus hops. Malty, lightly spiced, hoppy too. Very hearty.
