Medium to strong strength, straw and roasted malts, leafy hops, and burnt ester sugars. Lacks balance and proper intensity. Not sharp enough, nor delicate. Quite bold and over intensified.

1275,"2014-08-06",3.3,"Thanks Geoff,
This was poured into a pint glass. 
The appearance was a hazy dark copper/light brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. There was some light slightly sticky and foamy lacing. 
The smell had a bitter malty dried toffee to slight caramel aroma with a slight nutty edge in the background. 
The taste was mainly a sweet dry caramel/toffee toastiness. There wasnt any aftertaste but a dry caramel/toffee finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation seemed good for the style and for me as it was smooth and slightly creamy.

Looks as good as ESBs get. Deep copper-coloured body (bordering on brown), with some bubbles and a nice pillowy beige head.

Earthy hops, plums, apples, bread, and very solid caramel hints in the aroma. The smell is intense and inviting. Smells like an English Strong ale as much as an ESB.

The taste starts out with a mild English-style floral hop bite. Some fruitiness opens up as the beer warms up, producing a plum, apple, and grapefruit-like taste. Some mild sweetness is reinforced with a caramel malty breadiness. High in bittering hops. The after-taste is comprised of caramel notes, roastiness, and bitterness coming hand in hand.

Medium body to it. A little hefty, but very pleasant on the palate. The carbonation level is quite high at first, but then it comes down to a very comfortable level. Not very dry, no hints of alcohol.

Quite drinkable for an ESB. Goes down fairly smoothly, yet may become a bit too filling.

Overall, Propeller has really accomplished the goal of making a true English-style ESB.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","DenisLD"

1275,"2006-10-27",3.5,"I enjoyed this straight from the bottle at Fogg & Suds on Robson Street. Very little aroma to speak of. It poured a deep, cloudy brown with a small silky head and some lace. Apparently there is a small addition of wheat malt to enhance the head, perhaps adding to the cloudiness. Definitely darker malts than the bitters Id tasted before (esp. Fullers) - crystal, maybe dark chocolate malts. Hopping excellent - hides the sweetness of the crystal malt. Carbonation was very light - at first, I thought it was flat! A bit of a sharp mouthfeel, as it was served too cold. Very rewarding brew!","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mgermani"

Full bodied with a flood of substantial sweet-bready maltiness up front which becomes better balanced on the plate with the soft but resinous piney hop blend. The darker malts add a nice toasty ""burnish"" to the overall taste profile. The finish is moderate with a pleasant bittering that over takes the biscuit-like after taste. Like all good session ales this one tasted better as it warmed up.

1275,"2003-02-23",3.7,"Chocolate malt aroma, copper, with a small toffee head. Malt/hops flavour at first, followed by a Great malt aftertaste. Terrific mouth feel, a lovely Bitter!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DougShoemaker"
1275,"2003-02-04",3.7,"Clear, dark copper colour, with large bubbly off white head that slowly creeps up the glass.  Malty nose with faint floral hops.  Taste is sweet with hints of chocolate and wheat.  Very smooth and rather refreshing for a thicker beer.  Great beer from Halifax.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","BeerPrince"
1275,"2003-01-12",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 20, 2007 RE-RATE: My original rating (below is pretty embarrassing, so since Ive gotten my hands on another bottle a few years later, I though it was time for a re-rate. Pours a dark copper with a small off-white head. Aroma is sweet and nutty, with a hint of chocolate, and some UK-style hops. Body is right on target for the style. Flavour has some caramel and toasted cereal off the top, some underlying chocolate and smokiness, and a moderately dry and grassy finish. Quite nice.

ORIGINAL: I dont have much experience with the Bitter style, so I""ll have to take the word of folks like Oakes that this is a good example of the style. I can say that it poured an orangey-copper colour, was a little spritzy with a nice malt/hop balance and a fruity character in the flavour, and had a dry and slightly metallic finish. Quite smooth and tasty.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
1275,"2003-01-06",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2003 (Draught) On tap in the Knot Pub in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. I am rather partial to Propeller's Porter but this was rather good with its malt and hops favours none the less. Nice finish... I am going to have to rate more bitters than try this again.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
1275,"2003-01-02",4.2,"What else can be said about ""Propeller Extra Special Bitter"" that VENOM didnt already say in his review. Pretty much spot on. A rich, full-bodied brew from the East Coast of Canada that does an excellent job blending a traditionally strong, hoppy taste with a very flavourful and malty complexity, which sports a very pleasing aftertaste.

Ive grown quite fond of traditional English style bitters in recent years and while this one doesnt hail from England, it does follow on the heels of some of the UKs most recognized labels. Nice full colour, surprisingly long lasting head, which coats the glass for long lengths of time. (Im just finishing off my bottle now after about 45-60 minutes and the sides of my glass remain heavily coated.)

A great bitter beer that Ive returned to on more than one occasion.

1275,"2002-12-20",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2004 Re-rate 05/03/03: Aroma is a great hop malt balance, plus a bit of spiciness (cloves, cinnamon). Deep amber colour, smaller than average but mostly lasting white head. Full-bodied, smooth and pleasing mouthfeel. Taste is mostly bitter hops, with a touch of chocolate and cinnamon. Lingering hop bitter finish.","Halifax, Nova Scotia, CANADA","OKBeer"

Immediately crisp and brash with a medium body and ample carbonation. Soft malt flavor. Hints of caramel and chocolate malt husks. Fairly dry. Very clean and smooth with a touch of fruit and nut skins in the aftertaste. Hints of metal abound. Turns fruitier as it warms, with an emphasis on black cherries. Drier and more metallic towards the end. Finishes slightly softer with increased bitterness and a walnut/black plum mixture. Not very complex, but sociable.
