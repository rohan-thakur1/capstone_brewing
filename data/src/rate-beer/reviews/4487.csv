4487,"2014-10-14",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 16, 2014 330ml bottle served in a snifter glass.
A: Pours a very dark brown almost black color forming no head. Ive tried to put it let say, aggressively and then it formed some big bubbled brown head. Low retention and no lacings. BFM strong beers style
S: Sour and vinegar, slight sweet and very malty in the nose. Strong notes of caramel and roasted malts. A bit too fruity to the style. Light notes of alcohol
T: Slightly sweet and roasted malts upfront. Overall sour taste with a mild bitter hoppy end
M: Heavy and molasses body. Very low carbonation. Sour to bitter aftertaste
O: Good drinkability but, a difficult beer. Not a Bock beer for sure, not a Eisbock either. Its far too sour and too bitter to the style. However, I would recommend it to sour and aggressive beer lovers. From my favorite Swiss brewery!

4487,"2012-12-19",3.0,"Bottled.  Poured near black and quite still.  It was hard to get past sour oak and cherries in the aroma department.. some vanilla and tobacco were deep down, as well as dark chocolate as it warmed.. interesting, but not necessarily enticing.  The flavor was sour as expected, with cherries, oak, and dark fruit skins leading.. cocoa and licorice supported.. spicy, sour, very oaky finish.  Medium-bodied with almost no perceptible carbonation on the palate.. the sourness at least hid the boozage well.. too barrel-ly and funky for my liking.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
4487,"2012-11-12",3.4,"Bottle from Knightly Spirits in Orlando, FL. Pours viscous with almost no trace of carbonation and an instant enveloping aroma of sour yeast and vinegar. The flavor is enormous: dark fruits, toffee and sour cherries punch up front with vinegar swimming around the sides of the tongue. Very soft carbonation (almost none) and medium/full body. This is pretty much dark, still liquid in a bottle. My American mouth is used to more carbonation, but I enjoyed this overall.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","Floback"

Strong aroma that shows bits of tart cherries and quite a bit of smoke, malt, dark fruits, and alcohol. Much, much more sour flavor hits right away with tons of tart cherry and grape, followed by more maltiness, a definite smoke aspect again, some char, and lingering caramel. This is definitely interesting. Not bad.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

Aroma is boozy with soy sauce, molasses, burnt caramel and dark fruit. Taste is rather tart with sour cherries, booze, molasses, soy sauce, roasted malt, burnt caramel, funky yeast, herbal and medicinal notes, and mild earthiness. Body is uncarbonated and slick with a light-medium overall feel. Boozy legs coat the glass and there is a mild warmth from the alcohol. Ends with more tart fruit, sour cherries, molasses, soy sauce, caramel, booze and medicine. Odd beer. Not what I would pick as an eisbock in a blind test.","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"

On the nose its vinous, deep dark ripe fruit plum, chocolate, and a touch of balsamic acidity. On the palate it is much of the same with a smooth slightly creamy mouthfeel that gets cut with some great acidity and deep dark notes of tobacco, chocolate, tar... all lightened by some bright cherry plum sneaking through in spots.
