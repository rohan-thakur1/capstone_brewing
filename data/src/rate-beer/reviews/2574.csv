Pours a nice copper-hued golden colour with a small white head that leaves a touch of lace. Aroma of slightly fermented fruit, light caramel, a touch of spice & herbs (chamomile, cardamon, anise). Flavour is quite sweet and fruity up front - hints of peach and ice wine - drying out a bit in the middle where some tart grape and clove start to come through, and looping back towards sweetness in the finish, with notes of orange candy. A bit of booze warmth in the back as well. Interesting stuff - Id like to try a fresher bottle sometime to see how it compares.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"

Coriander and clove to start. Bitterness is on the spicy side with an overall earthy character and it is yeasty. Not tart but close. It is 8% abv and I do get some warming but no sign in the taste.

2574,"2014-11-29",3.5,"My research leads me to believe that when ratebeer calls this a traditional ale they mean that this is a Scottish Gruit. Proper glassware is a mug and thats what I had it in.
The appearance was a nice hazy golden orange to yellow color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about less than a minute. The lacing was somewhat spotty and somewhat clingy here and there. 
The smell was sweet herbal, light white wine (but nice). Light citrus fruit amplifies a silky sweet underlying malt.
The taste was herbally sweet with a nice florally silky and somewhat light acceptable white wine balanced by citric fruits. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a nice sessionable quality about it. The carbonation was there - good. I have to say theres a nice smooth sweet herbal quality rolling over my tongue.

An rather unusual experience provides what I can only assume beer might have tasted like long ago. If that was the case Im not sure I would drink quite as much. On the other hand as long as it did not cost upwards of $14.99 like this did I may change my mind. Worth trying once, this unique beer compares favorably to Dogfish Heads own remake of an ancient recipe.

Aroma / Appearance - A bronze body sits below a thin white head despite a strong aggressive pour. Herbs in late spring mix with a dry autumnal feel. Musty books complete a very rustic feel.

Flavor / Palate - Earthy spices and herbs refresh the palate at first. A moderate bite grows over the course of a few sips. A solid finish leaves behind memories of a respectable experiment that is worth sampling once. In general though I believe Id rather purchase the Saison instead if I had to choose one to drink on a regular basis.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Esters brighten things, adding citrus, while dry clove and pepper phenols help keep it on the dry side.Ive wanted to try this beer forever and its a bit anticlimactic upon having it, as its just very well-rounded, balanced and quite subtle. Soft malts, fluffy carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Malty, but spicy as well and incredibly wine-like on the finish, thanks to all the herbs and the Dupont yeast. Delicious.

titre, mais on pouvait sattendre à des merveilles avec cette magnifique brasserie Dupont.
Le côté herbes aromatiques a été développé dans lesprit strictement gustatif, et non pas 
fausse antiquité que dautres sites auraient pu exploiter. Bravo à Aubechies Blicquy dêtre
resté au côté original dune bière belge spéciale, ce quelle devait être, mais il fallait éviter
tous les écueils faciles de ce genre historique, et même ici antique ... Bravo encore.
Donc par rapport au site Ratebeer, insistons sur le fait que cette bière nest pas une « traditional
ale », mais une « spéciale belge » (ou « spéciale ancien belge » si vous préférez!!!).
Les artistes de chez Dupont nous ont sur cette base concocté (cest le mot!!!) un merveilleux breuvage gaulois aromatique.
Bouteille de 75 cl, bouchonnée de liège, à létiquette sobre (comme toujours chez Dupont).
Couleur doré foncé brillant. 
Clarté nette, pure.
Bulles moyennes par milliers partout (mais quand on a entendu lexplosion à louverture
de cette bouteille, rien détonnant....).
Mousse blanc/beige bien formée : floconnée en bas et crémeuse en haut au centre.
Arômes de pain gris, levure, foie de veau, pointe de muscade, croûte de pain.
1ère bouche soyeuse à lentrée très originale, sur des épices orientales fines, fleurs et herbes,
suivies dun malt caramel. Arrière-bouche bien pleine, complète avec une pointe désaltérante
dherbes.
2ème bouche dun fantastique ensemble céréales/houblon/levure, avec une pointe dépices fines.
3ème bouche fleurie sublime, avec une pointe de lavande, de santal et daubépine.
Arrière-bouche très pleine et qui progresse.
Longueur (avec une bouteille très légèrement réfrigérée, comme conseillé par le brasseur)
sublime, avec des fleurs en tous sens et lorge qui revient, à la texture très moelleuse.
Levure douce, veloutée, avec une pointe de sel marin et de poivre.
Alcool très bien, qui donne un soutien massif à cette bière.
Finale magique, splendide, grandiose.
Conclusion : une réussite totale, dans un format qui a fait ses preuves, et qui apporte à notre
boisson nationale un attrait considérable, voire extrême quand elle atteint ces sommets...","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with herbs and a fair amount of malt balance; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, coriander, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, wheat, bread, grass, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, coriander, pepper, herbal, floral, wheat, bread, grass, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with herbal flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.

2574,"2013-06-19",3.7,"750ml served in a Duvel tulip.

A - Pours a hazy burnt orange with 3 fingers of white head that has excellent retention. The head forms a nice cap and collar and never dissolves.

S - Ground dried grain, very earthy grassiness, black and green pepper corns, cloves, apples, peaches, apricots, and banana esters. Soured cantaloupe really comes out on the second pour.

T - More herbal than the nose, very spicy, concentrated floral flavors, its hard to pick out what spices youre tasting. Good dose of melon and stone fruit, especially apricots mesh with a heavy malty base while herbal bitterness balances out and keeps things semi dry.

M - Aggressive stingy carbonation at first but mellows out and turns creamy. Heavier body but the carbonation helps lighten it up.

Not a common style of beer but this is one of the best Ive had. Awesome yeast and a hefty malt base. The herbs and spices work very well and arent overdone. Its a challenge to pick out what youre tasting. This would go great with smoked meats.
A well crafted beer. Worth seeking out if youre into interested in the style.

Its an interesting beer that is rather ambiguous in many ways. Not quite a Belgian strong nor is it a saison--but taking cues from both. At times it even reminds me of a maibock. Lots of floral spices, a bit of grass, and a bit of a pungent after taste, that isnt a bad thing. It finishes surprisingly long. Pours a muddy golden hue with fairly good head retention.

Flavour has a lot of citrusy zest with some okay pale Belgian malts and candied sugar finish. Carbonation is finer, like sparkling wine with some dryness coming from the yeast.

Nose is rustic, earth, soap, lemon, lime, herbal, grassy hops, light pepper and salt. Flavor is interesting--kinda like a mix between a saison and a more sugary Belgian strong ale like Delirium Tremens or Corsendonk Abbey ale.  Has some dark fruits, light vegetal notes, grass, and much more herbal/spicey than the nose. A bit sweeter than expected.   As it warms, it dries out a good bit to a herbal lemon tea like flavor, quite complex a s delicious. This is dedinitely not one of those beers you can ""read"" from

2574,"2012-10-07",4.1,"2012 edition: Yellow gold. Ornate white crown of uniform foam. Riveting nose of potpourri, apricot puree, tangerine, flowery hops (Russian sage, honeysuckle), assorted peppercorns, toasted piecrust, vanilla cream, putty, sugar cookie. Plenty of the signature Dupont sulfur, as well, along with some gunpowder and white pepper. Soft, natural carbonation. Highly vivacious, initially, with Duponts telltale peppery phenolic sass and sparkle quelled by a slippery wheat-induced twang and a splash of floral hops reminiscent of lilac and honeysuckle. Fruity esters are profuse, slathering gently sweet dried-pineapple, explosive peach, and supple apricot jam atop a firm and well-structured malt foundation. Considering its understated presence and buoyancy, the malt shows astounding detail and textural depth as well as some cakey girth. Never at all cloying, however. Attenuation is flawless, cleansing the palate and briefly displacing the residuals to allow the crisper malt definition to vividly exude. Vanilla cream and mashed banana softness tempers the persistent pepperiness.  Finishes sharply herbaceous yet profoundly soft, nuanced, and moist with Juicy Fruit gum, subdued sulfury phenolics and sweetish honey-soaked malt. Mmmm, so beautiful and, remarkably, so effortlessly quaffable despite the abv. The balance is exemplary, which is quite the accomplishment considering the copious amounts of spices and herbs used in creating this.  Another masterpiece to add to Duponts lengthy list of crowning achievements.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

4.0 A: Deeply hazed brown-tinted orange color. Three fingers of foamy white head. Retention is very good and a good sized ring of lacing is left.

4.0 S: Herbalness abounds in the earthiest of ways. Hay and something like honey. The herbal assault is lead by jasmine and lemongrass, which may or may not even be in here. Wild apple and rotting wood funkiness. Some peppery spiciness from the yeast and maybe a touch of banana fruitiness. 

4.0 T: Banana comes to the forefront in the taste. Herbal and funky. Apple orchard, light woodiness, wet hay and grass, lemongrass, jasmine, sage. Moderate bitterness that has to come partially from the herbs. Peppery yeastiness. Bits of honey, some breadiness, lightly phenolic.

3.5 M: Light to ligher medium body. Carbonation is moderately spritzy to the point of almost being biting. Moderately creamy for the body.

2574,"2012-01-13",4.5,"Described as a Herbed/Spiced Beer on beerAdvocate, Im not really sure what to expect.  But of all the beers on the Holiday offering list, this is one of the few with a very good review/score on Advocate. So, we bought a case, and well just have to crack a bottle to see what weve got.

First off, the backside of the label tells this lengthy story about how the Posca Rustica came to be. I tried to read it all it one sitting, but had to come back to it in the morning. In any case, they weave a tale of a spiced version of a saison ale that was fed to the Roman soldiers while stationed in modern-day Belgium.

Posca Rustica pours out a darker amber color than the standard Saison.  Theres a significant rusty shade to the amber color, with a nice white fluffy foam on top.  The foam is thick and long-lasting, leaving a nice amount of lacing behind. The aromas are a beautiful melting pot of bready, yeasty-ness, but much less funky than a typical saison. The herbal components are evident, but not intense.

The herbal aromas follow through on the palate, which is really cool. In body, its fairly light like the saison, but  its got a much creamier, velvety mouth-feel. Its got this added layer of complexity that is as much about texture as it is flavor. Right about now, Im wishing I had ordered more than just this one case.","Connecticut, USA","TheCorkStops"

Aroma is earthy and lightly fruity and herbal. Theres a touch of Wit like spice - but maybe thats herb? Med + body. Frothy carb. Flavor is earth, herb and fruit.

Dorée type paille, col blanc.
Superbe arôme alliant à la fois douceur et amertume. On y retrouve la levure mais aussi pas mal dépices, ainsi que un aspect fruité type bubblegum.
La dégustation offre la même surprise en bouche. Ayant déjà pu goûter aux bières brassées selon les vieilles traditions (difficile den avoir une recette précise vu que on en a très peu décrits de lépoque) je mattendais à une bière de type gruit donc plus axée sur cet aspect végétal/ancien, de bières brassées sans houblon qui est parfois difficile à approcher.
Cette dernière est facile à déguster, une levure et des épices confèrent un palais intéressant que jai trouvé plus doux que épicés. Par moment, javais souvenir de réglisse ou anis, fruité également avec un peu dabricot et de miel pour la douceur.

2574,"2010-12-27",3.9,"Sampled from the tap, July 2010 at Chez Moeder Lambic Fontainas
The beer arrives with a one-finger thick, creamy, off-white colored head, while the beer is a hazed, pale gold / yellow color.  The aroma is herbal and hop like up front (even if it is gruit derived), and has a pale, hay-like grain character to it.  The nose reminds me of the scent of orange blossoms, sweet clove in the finish, grassy coriander and that Dupont yeast mustiness.  There is certainly a very herbal, hop-like character to this note.

Sweet, honey like pale grain flavors are found up front, while the finish has an almost menthol like, herbaceous bitterness that makes this end with a very dry character; this is especially true when coupled with the typical, musty, sort of cotton ball like Dupont-yeast phenolics (that arent quite medicinal in character).  A biting bitterness is noticeable at times, but others sees the honey and pale malt sweetness being a bit stronger.  The beer is nicely light and quaffable and there is a lemon like flavor here as well as a nice grassy note.  This is quite a nice beer, it is very much Saison like, which I will certainly never complain about.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2574,"2010-12-19",3.6,"Le liquide dévoile une robe dorée.  La mousse blanche est tenace.  Une dentelle est observée.  Le nez est particulier et très lourd avec des herbes sèches et humides, des fleurs et des épices, du grain mielleux et des arômes acidulés.  Le goût est semblable : des saveurs mordantes de houblons se combinent avec une levure un peu folle, piquante et fruitée.  Quelques notes boisées sont ressenties.  En bouche, le liquide a un corps moyen avec une effervescence active et une texture qui me semble huileuse.  La finale apporte des notes fruitées et des notes amères somme toute asséchantes.  En résumé, bière singulière.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

This is not a soft round beer, to the contrary this is a very sharp beer.  Aggressive carbonation, dusty sensation, orange peels, mineral spices flavour, some tartness.

2574,"2006-12-03",3.8,"Deep golden-amber pour with a rather small white head for Dupont, but staying and leaving traces on the glass. Original spicy nose, it is rather hard to pick out individual varieties though, so the job is well done. Quite musty, mushroomy, wet, cellary flavours due to a particularly active cork. In mouth, the Dupont yeast imparts a good range of exotic fruits esters and the hops do manage to leave a bitter impression that contrasts with the cerealic, quite malty flavour profile. This is sweeter (rather grainy) than I anticipated and less peppery while also being less effervescent, but Dupontesque enough and original to booth that I can only enjoy it.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2574,"2006-10-08",3.5,"UPDATED: NOV 12, 2006 Any first impressions?
-A thin ring of foam stays atop the golden yellow.
-Cereal sweetness and coriander-led spicing are applauded by the bubblegum yeastiness.
-Honeyed cereals and biting alcohol satisfy even though complexity isnt reached.
-The prickly effervescence isnt as expansive as the usual Duponts.

What if you dig deeper?
-The dry, herbal spiciness fades to a whisper.
-The bubblegum character returns towards the end.
-Cork tends to mar the beers aroma after the bottles been sitting on its side for a few months.
-The spicy Dupont yeast signature is obvious, but isnt as eloquent as I have known it to be.
-An interesting creation, as is always the case with Dupont, but theyve achieved much better results in most of their other, stellar offerings.

Tremendous aromatic depth and enticement...very spicy and herbal to the point that trying to pin down all the various components is a lost cause.
