596,"2017-02-22",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2017 500ml New Bottle. Pours a dark mahogany with lots of visable carbonation. Rich nose full of caramel and hints of spice. Medium body with strong notes of caramel, chocolate, and malts.","Palmerston North, NEW ZEALAND","Samtzu"
596,"2016-09-27",3.3,"Bomber, lizard style. Dark brown in color with a lasting light beige head. Aroma is nutty, toasty, coffee, prune, plum. Flavor is dry, not that Belgian, almost like a brown ale, slightly bitter. Medium-bodied with high carbonation. Good but a bit off for the style.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
596,"2016-01-08",2.9,"Bitter burnt coffee chocolate taste on the initial taste, aroma of burnt chocolate hops.

Really shines though with its after taste, roasted coffee and chocolate, super smooth, really heavy and high abv, moderate bitterness.

Would try again, rather heavy though.","","GarrettGotu"
596,"2015-12-31",4.0,"Bottle. I wouldnt recognize that this is not from Belgium. Aroma of coffee and cognac. Very good.","","User369532"

596,"2014-09-01",3.4,"It looks great deep red and brown colour with a frothy head and smells fantastic. But I was a little let down with the flavor, still a great beer to drink but not as full on as a typical Belgian dubbel. Id never turn it down but I wanted more out of it","Perth, AUSTRALIA","Hop2Clancys"
596,"2014-07-21",3.8,"Bottle from Beer Cartel (Jan 2014). Deep copper/red, small creamy tan head, candy sugar, Belgian yeast, cinnamon, sweet cherries, chocolate, vanilla, oak, mild bitterness, medium body, slippery thin texture. Very good.","AUSTRALIA","ShaneJ"
596,"2014-06-29",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2015 An immensely impressive effort from Tuatara. Lacks just a little of the subtlety of the Belgian benchmarks - and that will likely come with time.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
596,"2014-05-08",3.8,"650ml bottle. Pours a fairly clear ruby amber, with a small off-white head, which lasts quite well, and leaves decent lacing. Plum, candied fruits, hints of black cherry and port make up the aroma. Mild fruity and spice hops up front give way to port and plums leading into the mid-palate, where the plum flavour is more pronounced, and joined by a touch of chocolate. Black cherry and muscat give it a smooth, dark finish. This is a nice, solid dubbel. If anything, it could do with a touch more weight to the body, but the flavours are lovely.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"
596,"2013-12-18",3.6,"I liked this, it was what it said it was. Then I thought it might have been a bit shy on the malt, a bit thin in the middle and didnt finish with as much tang as I thought it might. Having said that I wish I had the patience to keep one aside for a few months just in case it gets a lot better. Id easily buy this again and have no hesitation in being one a gift for a friend, even if its not a top marks beer.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","Pdubyah"
596,"2013-11-24",3.3,"I am typically a fan of the seasonal releases but this one did little for me. Palate is a bit on the subdued side and cant say the flavours lingers for any significant period of time.","NEW ZEALAND","omega"
596,"2013-10-26",3.7,"Clear deep copper poor. High carbonation and a soapy sustainable white head. Aroma was bready and rich. Flavor was rich deep I found bready yeast at first but after warming slightly there was very slightu chocholate and dark fruits. Enjoyable drink that was very smooth and interesting.","NEW ZEALAND","Rangi"
596,"2013-10-19",3.7,"rating from backlog. a very standard tasty dubbel, with all the belgian yeasts, banana, and raisins youd expect.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","lisagirl"
596,"2013-09-26",3.8,"Aha, got you you little bugger!
Coppery brown colour with plentiful carbonation and a smattering of whitish-cream coloured head. Authentic caramel and powdered cocoa aromas along with faint dusty basement aromas typical of the style. The flavour more or less mirrors the aroma. This beer has been done well and leaves a lingering hankering for another. A little out of style with the abv, but this is mere nitpicking on a beer that I found to be gratifyingly tasty,","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
596,"2013-09-20",3.9,"Vibrant copper colour, with a fine off-white head. The aroma is fairly subdued, with some fruity hops and a range of mild malty notes. The palate is dominated by the malt sweetness, with an abundance of mango, passionfruit and banana tropical fruit flavours and phenolics, balanced with a mid to light dose of well integrated hops bitterness that tempers the richness and alcohol. There are also hints of chocolate malt, raisin and prune, which are likely to develop over time. Velvety smooth texture. A very appealing beer.","NEW ZEALAND","SAChubb"
596,"2013-09-17",3.5,"I didn't read about the benefits of cellaring until after opening it so I might have to buy another. Certainly has potential with excellent flavours and body.
