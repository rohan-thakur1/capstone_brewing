3059,"2011-06-18",4.3,"thanks to weeare138 for sharing this, I was wowed, a brett quadruple -what a unique adventurous and inspiring brew.

Enjoyed cool in a tulip

A a lively caramel w/ small cream cap in the appearance -no crystal clear, but looks very nice in the glass, the retention is decent. The smell is off the charts - wonderful aromas of rainer cherry, golden and granny smith apples and slight earthy compliment, mild floral and herbal tinges from the brett -wow.
The feel is sweet, fruity and mildly acidic with the funk effect noticeable in texture. There is still a mild sweetness so I would say finish is more semi dry.

The taste is wonderful with the juicy apple tart berry and light grape notes blending well in this with the slightly fruity tang of wild yeast blending with spice and slight caramel from the malt foundation. the light funky rounds out the flavor adding complexity to the sour tinges and gentle fruitiness. To say this was drinkable is an understatement. The sour flavor is equisite - it does exactly what is needed without going overboard, the nuances are so plentiful and complexity is huge in this -top notch Iron Hill!","York, Pennsylvania, USA","Slatetank"
3059,"2011-03-12",3.7,"500ml swingtop via a trade. Opens with a reassuring hiss. Pours with a murky orange-brown body and a small tan head with a bit of alcohol legs on top. Aromas of oak, possibly red wine, tannins, a light tartness, caramel, toffee and chestnuts. Light notes of tobacco and ethanol. Slightly corky. Flavors of a bit tannic, bitter, tobacco, oak, light currant and berry. Musty, cherry, lightly funky. Medium to light carbonation. Alcohol is extremely well hidden.

3059,"2009-05-19",4.2,"Handbottle, via axilla.  Pours a hazy amber body with a small fleeting beige head that ran to a thin ring.  The nose is very bretty, actually overpowering the big malt bill.  Grape and plum fruitiness with oak, light bourbon, and caramel malt.  No noticeable alcohol on the nose.  The flavor is just a great melding of the brett and toffee maltiness, balanced with a bit of oaky dryness.  Zero alcohol apparency, just a light warmth to the finish.  Virtually zero residual sugars left in this guy.  This might be one of the brettiest beers Ive had.  The high attenuation keeps this 10.5% beast pretty light on the palate with zero stickiness, unlike what you might expect from a Barley Wine like this.  The mouthfeel is just awesome on this one.  Overall, a unique beer to be sure, I hope that they make this one again.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
3059,"2009-03-22",3.7,"growler - thanks to bvc for sharing this interesting (to say the least) beer; dark amber with slight tan head; initial aroma is mainly of dirty feet; lots of funk, dirt and pooh; drinks quite nice considering the off-putting aromas; texture is thin and sweet; wood, sugar, tartness; the barley wine seems to have disappeared for the most part; over a few glasses, this really started to grow on us; glad we had a growler to allow for multiple samples; still the aromas were quite awful","Seattle, Washington, USA","SuzyGreenberg"

3059,"2009-01-01",4.1,"Grolsch swingtop handbottle, courtesy TheEepiest.  Bottled on 10/30/08 and consumed on 11/9/08.  Pours a dark and dense, muddy, caramel brown color with hints of mauve.  A small, dense, creamy beige head settles to a thin film, leaving splotches of microfilm lacing on the glass.  The aroma comes as a bit of a shock, as it is certainly unlike any other barleywine Ive ever encountered.  Dried sweet and sour fruit notes are first to hit, followed by caramel apples, cider, figs, berries, and sour cherries.  Funky, soured French oak asserts its vanilla influence, while cinnamon and raw cacao nibs lend earthy, spicy depth.  Upon the first sip, the thought of Jolly Pumpkin Maracaibo Especial immediately comes to mind, only reduced to a barleywine.  Dry caramel, apple cider, cocoa, toasted oak, and vanilla are all featured prominently.  Sour sherries play a surprisingly big role, with hints of bitter orange peel, cinnamon and nutmeg lending spicy depth.  There is a bretty overtone throughout, contributing to the relative dryness.  Medium to full bodied and sweet, but not cloying, the finish turns slightly bitter and dry.  I keep coming back to the thought that if Jolly Pumpkin made a barleywine, this would be it.  Fantastic beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

I had an extremely difficult time figuring this one out. Very enjoyable. Mildly bitter with sweet malt, notes of medicinal cherry and a bit of barnyard and hay.

3059,"2008-12-23",3.9,"Growler at miketds house

** Summary ** - Another treat at the tasting this one came fresh from the state of Pennsylvania.  By now I have had so many barrel aged beers that it takes something special to stand out.  This one does a great job but I think the sourness will take more time to develop.

** Aroma / Appearance ** - Thin and filmy the body is opaque with a deep brown hue.  Vanilla, cinnamon, oaky, and sweetness blend together with a residual funkiness like a young lambic.

** Flavor / Palate ** - Stale cheese, horseblanket and barley create a very unusual flavor profile for what should be a barrel aged barleywine.  Bone dry at the end it soothes the throat with the chewy thick taste.  I could not imagine drinking much of this as it would get to you but a little bit was a nice treat.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The lambic from the oak is noticeable right away in the aroma, very  sharp and tart. Flavor is the bittnerness and tart of a lambic with the complexity and malt profile of a good barleywine. The labic features come up front, slight funk and lemon, while the barleywine makes itself known on the back end with a nice hop and yeast profile.  Notes of oak as well, a slight vanilla and wood flavor. The finish is very dry and slightly sticky.

I would almost tempt a guess as red wine? Some sour cherries. Behind all the odd funk is plenty of rich maltiness. A bit of alcohol. Lighter aromas of dying citrus fruit. Pours a thick, dark charred caramel brown with a glimmer bright orange around the edges. is the beer supposed to taste like this or is it a complete accident?

Slightly vinous with hints of tart grape tannin. Medium to full bodied with the alcohol showing on the finish.

Flavor is good, still pretty big with full malts, despite a weird brett infection, ok sweetness, medium caramel and Munich malts, ok raisiny and apple fruits, and a slightly drying finish from the wood and brett.

The bartender told me they used bourbon barrels but i didn’t pick up on that at all.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
3059,"2008-11-18",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2009 Cask at IH Wilmington.  Great stuff.  Oaky as hell.  Reminds me more of a Belgian strong than a barleywine.  Heavy toast from the wood goes extremely well with the bretty finish.  I really dont think Ive had another beer quite like this one.","Livingston, New Jersey, USA","BrianK"
3059,"2008-11-18",4.4,"Hand-bottle sent by Miver, shared with a few people. This stuff was fantastic. Thick, rich red wine aroma, toast and chocolate shavings, along with some mandarin orange and funky cheese. A tartness is present with the oak which is just fantastic, and is the first I’ve seen any kind of vineous barrel character in a barleywine. It worked extremely well. One could just keep smelling this thing for days. The flavor wasn’t as exciting, the age and mellowness of the barleywine were a bit taken over by the barrel, but things just didn’t have the same oomph or complexity, and the thickness of the aroma was missing. However it still had a nice, sweet body, a touch of spicy tart, and a wonderful milk chocolate finish. Outstanding stuff.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
3059,"2008-11-01",4.4,"Draft, at IH Wilmington. Poured murky reddish amber, capped with a thin beige head. Aroma of caramel, oak, orange zest, musty wild yeast and vanilla. Flavor exhibits nice interplay between caramel, malt, brown sugar, dark fruit and citrus, which are complimented by oak, earthy notes, soap, and tangy wild yeast. Medium to full bodied with little carbonation; this was quite easy to drink. Finishes with brown sugar, caramel, brett, and mild hops. I really enjoyed this; I may have to make a return trip to Wilmington tomorrow.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"
3059,"2008-10-31",4.8,"On tap at Wilmington. Hazy burnt orange color with a smaller head. Aroma of wood and bretty tartness, brown sugar, dark fruit (plums), vanilla and caramel. The orangy taste of the regular Old Tom is still present, and blends nicely with the heavier tartness of the brett. Tangy texture and candy orange finish. As good as it gets in so many ways.","Swedesboro, New Jersey, USA","MrBendo"
