It¬ís full-bodied, very lightly warming considering the ABV, and with a suitable carbonation level.

2299,"2016-05-12",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 12, 2016 33cl bottle at home (12 X 2016). Beautifully looking pitch black tanned brew, oily and sticky, with a cassonade, brown collar which is lovely thick and frothy. The nose is a bit disappointing, with faint metallic, coffee and some roast features. There is some peat or turf in there as well, clearly hinting at the whisky barrel aging. On the other hand side, there is a sharp malt aroma in the body. Having won the Brouwland brewing competition with the base beer, the Inglorious Quad, this whisky flavoured has less hops sensations. These bitter aromas only come in the mouthfeel, together with lovely roasted notes and great peat character. Even brandy. The dryness is even strengthened by the hoppy and even herbs backbone and chocolate, caramelish sweetness. The sugar is quite heavy, backed with the malts and coffee extras. Think of bread and dough too. Besides the herbs, there are quite a lot of black spices in there as well. The medium yet vivid carbonation ensures an interesting taste feeling. Conclusion: Perfect looking barrel aged quad with complex and very different taste senstation (herbs, black spices, malts, sugar, hops, roast, caramel, chocolate, coffee), yet an overly peated and dull nose and dry-ish, alcoholic finish. Pretty Belgian, regarding the earthy malted features and of course: The Belgian Owl whisky addition, which is a lovely pale yellow distilled mash on its own.previous rating: 15cl draft at the 9th Bruges Beer Festival 2016 (7 II 2016). The Belgian Owl on whisky barrels. The result is a black tanned, not that heavy and very tasteful quad beer. The mouthfeel however is not that rich, and not even complex. The peat sensations are terrific, hiding the lingering sweetness - which is a very good thing. There is coffee, caramel and chocolate in the brew, making it a bitter stout with a lovely carbonation. The body feels a that - a tiny that - soury, maybe because of the whisky (I don¬ít know)? Lovely barrel aged brew.previous score: 7/10;4/5;7/10;4/5;14/20.","Waarschoot, BELGIUM","Hamirubi"
