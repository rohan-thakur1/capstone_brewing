629,"2017-04-19",3.2,"10floz draft served in a medium sized snifter. Basically black in appearance with a ring of foam. Nose has a husky, roasted malt aroma. The palate is a heavy medium and somewhat robust. Mostly straight forward dark roast flavor with faint coconut upon the follow through.","","balloonbuffoon"

629,"2017-03-15",3.9,"Dark black. Nice. Velvetty smooth. Creamy. A hint of butter. Coconut. Quite tasty.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","gregwilsonstl"
629,"2017-03-04",4.4,"Tap at the source with blonderedhead. 10 oz pour. Coffee black in color with tan head. Nose is roasty and malty with coffee and chocolate notes. Spectacular aroma. Taste is predominantly roasted malts with a coffee like bitterness offset by the coconut sugary sweetness. Alcohol makes its presence felt a little bit but not at the expense of the quality of flavor. Almost a slight dark fruit characteristic that gives way to a dark chocolate finish. Very delicious. I would put it a notch above the standard chocolate milk stout. Dangerous Man delivers yet again.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"
629,"2017-01-04",4.1,"Tap. Pours opaque black, large creamy tan head, dissipates slowly, nice lacing. Aroma is roasty, toasted coconut, lactose sugar, cocoa powder. Flavors is medium sweet, very light bitter, loads of coconut, milk chocolate, mounds bar, roasted malt, hints of marshmallow. Medium body, silky mouthfeel. Solid adjunct Stout for sure.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

629,"2015-11-26",3.7,"Approximately 10 oz. pour from a growler during a tasting on 11-21-15. Thanks to falco242. Pours dark brown with a small to moderate amount of light tan head. Nice smell features scents of coconut and coconut husk. Mounds candy bar flavor. Really good. Lively and frothy in the palate. Medium body. Darn good beer overall, although not as stellar as some of the early ratings here suggest. Dangerous Man Peanut Butter Porter this is not.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

629,"2013-04-07",3.9,"On tap and out of the growler, this is a tasty beer.  Dark beer with lacy, coffee colored head.  The coconut is as prounced as Id like but is noticable.  Lots of roasted malt that almost over power the coconut, but nice and sweet.  Good chocolate flavor too.

629,"2013-04-04",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2013 Poured from a growler dated April 2nd. Pours a nice rich dark coffee color with a bit of a tan head that quickly fades. Aroma is coconut get some lactose sugar, nice coffee and chocolate balance as well. Taste is a bit of roasted coconut and chocolate, finishes with a light coffee bitter, body was a lot thinner than I expected. Just had it on tap and it has a much better body and coconut flavor is much more potent on tap, try it fresh!","Farmington, Minnesota, USA","XmnwildX12"
