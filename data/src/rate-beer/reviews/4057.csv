4057,"2017-05-19",3.1,"Can from CBC Belmont. Extrememly pale hazy straw yellow gold with head and lace. Light peachy citrus floral aroma. Very light citrus pineapple grassy hay sweetness with medium light non-descript peppery citrus bitterness in very dry finish since this beer tastes like it has no malt in it. Very light body fairly soft and somewhat watery. If this is what the future holds for APA, count me out. No way this should be at the top of the category.

4057,"2017-03-23",3.6,"473ml can, thanks Marc, really appreciated. Aroma: big burst of clementines, almost too much, peaches, lemon and quite herbacy. App: hazy and bright pale, small white head, good lacing. Taste and palate: light body, soft carbonation, lemony, light bitter finish. Overall: maybe I was expecting too much from this beer because I find it just ok. Its drinkable but its watery and the clementines can get really overwhelming. I have other cans and will sure update this rating if its better. A good beer to drink on a terrace.

4057,"2017-03-15",3.9,"Can poured a slightly hazy wheat color with a thin layer of white head slow-moving visible carbonation. Aroma has nice fresh hops, Light Citrus layers, a bit of mild yeast and a touch of bitterness rounds It Off. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side and the carbonation a tad slow but overall it comes across crisp.

4057,"2017-03-02",4.4,"Canned on 02/15/17.
This was poured into a becher pint glass.
The appearance was a soft thick golden juicy non-filtered looking yellow color encased with a thick fingers worth of white foamy head that dissipated fairly quickly. Mild foamy rings of fairly thick lace.
The aroma splits the bitter to the sweet by melding notes of mango, pineapple, lemon, and peach to a super mellow malt base extremely smooth.
The flavor blends the bittersweet tranquility of the hops to the malts just extremely nice, as if there isnt any separation whatsoever. Just amazingly combined. Aftertaste leans towards the bitter side of the hops bringing in a slight rind-like contour to evenly flow on into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a superb sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine and so did the ABV. IBUs seem to be almost leaning towards an IPA, but somehow an ever so slightly smoothness like an APA seems to scale this one down to size for its suggested style.
Overall, first time with this delicate beast of a flavored APA and it wont be my last time with this handsome gem.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

4057,"2015-09-12",4.5,"Its probably unfair to compare beer and energy drinks, but I would say Night Shift Whirlpool drinks like the beer equivalent of one (NOS in particular). Huge tropical fruit character on the nose and palette along with significant grassy bitterness and flavor. Its ridiculously drinkable, too; and the fact it comes in a can is the cherry on top.

I poured a 16oz can into a mug. It was canned on 8/5/15. Thanks to my friend Jason T. for this can!

Appearance: Bright pale yellow hue with extremely hazy body (akin to a witbier). Pours to a two-finger, white, soapy head which retains and laces fairly well.

Smell: Huge tropical fruit aroma, especially passion fruit. Peach and grapefruit are also present with some grassy character lurking in the background. Very enticing.

Taste: Now that the Session IPA style has taken the world by storm, there are a lot of extra pale ales which are attempting to be the pale ale equivalent  lots of hops, but not ridiculously bitter. This beer is a great example of where and how to draw the line. Hops absolutely do dominate everything here, but theyre so tasty I dont mind. Just like the aroma, the taste begins with a lush tropical fruit juice sensation. It transitions almost on a dime into a bit dank, grassy/herbal hops  a common characterisitic found in New England-style IPAs (I guess this is a New England-style pale ale). A gentle, but firm bitterness due mostly to the dry/spicy nature of the hops rather than raw alpha acids. Not much in the way of malt character, which I dont mind because the hop flavors are so delectable. You could almost consider this a novelty brew, but I think its pretty amazing.

Drinkability: I drank this on a hot, humid summers night and I immediately wanted more. At only 4.5% ABV, Night Shift Whirlpool is absolutely sessionable. The body is fairly light, with a crisp mouthfeel. Its refreshing on the tongue and finishes quite clean, too. This is a beer Id want a case of to get me through the summer (maybe next year).

4057,"2015-02-25",3.5,"Nice hazy orange/yellow color. Definite aroma of peaches and citrus. Expected a stronger hop flavor and bitterness but was pleasantly surprised. Very drinkable. Looking forward to the next can.","Massachusetts, USA","docroc22"
4057,"2015-02-23",3.2,"Can as a bonus in a trade. About a month after canning date. poured into a lagunitas jar glass. Aroma is a smack in the face of citrus and tropical hops, like orange juice. Pour is very hazy, very pale orange to yellow with a small white head. A moderate hop flavor that is similar to nose, maybe a bit muted, followed by a moderate bitterness, finishing thin and watery, kind of killing the overall experience. The mouthfeel gets a little better as you sip, but the bitterness always seems a bit too high when compared to the malt backbone and mouthfeel. I rarely say this these days, but this needs a touch more body to support the hops bitterness. My can says it is only 4.3%, not the 5.2 that is/was listed here, so that could have something to do with it as well. Not sure if it varies batch to batch or if it is a recipe change. overall an ok beer that smells way better than the drinking experience.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"

4057,"2015-02-13",3.7,"Poured from a can dated 01/20/2015. 
Aroma is dominated by hops. Medium citrus with boatloads of stone fruit and lighter tropical fruit. Faint, pale malt note in the background. 
Pours a very, cloudy, pale, yellow straw color with a moderately sized, medium thick, white head that exhibits decent retention and nice lacing. 
Aroma is slightly sweet with moderate bitterness and faint malt notes. Moderate hop flavors of citrus, peach and pineapple, but not as vibrant as in the aroma. A little more malt and hops as it warms. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied and a but watery with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice very hoppy beer. I am usually the last person to want malt in my hoppy beers, but this one needs just a bit more malt character to add body and a bit of flavor.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Slightly hazy lemon straw color with a decent sized long lasting bone white head. Huge pine and citrus on the nose with just a touch of stone fruit. If theres malt in the nose my smell is too distracted. The flavor does hold some crackery bready maltiness and a lot more of the pine and citrus hop flavor. Very smooth bitterness.

4057,"2015-01-31",3.9,"Exceptionally pale pour. Hazy, light straw color. Thick, coating white head. Juicy lemon, grapefruit, pineapple aroma. Flavor is bright, juicy and dry. Lots of fruity hop character. Lemon, pear, grapefruit. Super dry. Little to no bitterness, which works fine since the malt profile is so understated. I think the aroma is a bit of an oversell, as the lack of any malt backbone kinda hangs the hops out to dry. It never reaches that promise of juicyness, as theres no fruity sweetness. Really tasty and really damn drinkable. Almost the archetype of the low bitterness, dry hoppy American ale. Really enjoyable.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"

APPEARANCE – 
Super light pale ale color. Light straw, perfectly see through. Head was really great, but disappeared too soon. NOSE - smelled amazing. Subtle hoppiness. Fruit at the beginning, yielding to some resin. 
FLAVOR –
A bit lacking. Flavor does not back up the great smells of fruity and slightly resinous hop. Very much an ale, not so pale.","Lee, Massachusetts, USA","bnokk"

Bottle: The aroma consists of peach, light tropical fruits, dank notes, grapefruit, and lemon peel. It pours a cloudy dull white-yellow with a two finger white head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a slightly thicker ring around the edges of the glass. The flavor starts with a quick dose of citrus and peach. The finish has lemon peel, faint grapefruit, and a touch of grapefruit. Its light-medium bodied with light-moderate carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

4057,"2014-08-21",4.2,"Odd milky yellow color that looks sort of like a hefeweizen with a tall white head. The aroma is a blast of citrus on top of some bread and a little weed. Sweet.

Refreshing, delicious and amazingly drinkable. 

My enthusiasm is a little tempered by the price, I swapped for this but I think the price at the brewery is $12 for a 4-pack of 12 oz cans.

4057,"2014-03-08",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2015 Batch #1, draught at the brewery on 3/8/14Lightly hazy, pale golden body is topped by a small white head, with low-moderate retention.Not too much in the nose, just some spare citrus and spicy hop notes, with very clean yeast and honeyed malt notes. Dry. Low acidity and quite reserved overall.The flavor is a different story, however. The light vanilla-like maltiness betrays the reserved nose, balancing nicely the very hoppy floral, spicy, almost earthy flavor. Never a touch of pine or even grapefruit here, with soft, dry white bread like maltiness keeping things quite easygoing. A pinch of perfume and some chewy, almost wheat-like notes help with the deliciously medium body. Just a phenomenal, delicious, flavorful beer. What it lacks in pure hop flavor it makes up for in the fact that it has literally no pine or resin burn and no alcohol. Almost as if youre drinking a 2.5% abv golden ale but with an outstanding hop profile. Perhaps just a touch sweet.  8/4/8/5/16Batch #2 on draught at the brewery, 3/29 and 4/3/14This one got attenuated a bit too much, unfortunately, and comes out VERY dry, borderline astringent, but thankfully the same lovely hop profile saves it.  Like an extremely dry, hoppy small beer or bitter, its still delicious and possibly even more drinkable, but just dosent have the malt softness that the first batch had.  Pretty minor complaint though.  Theyve got another batch in secondary as we speak.  Excited for that. Rating is an average of the two batches thus far.  8/4/7/4/14Multiple batches, 2015  I think theyve managed to improve this, which is impressive, as this is already a great beer.  Recent batches have been consistently incredible.  On par with the best pale ales Ive had.  I believe the late March cans show tons of tropical fruits, with a juicy yet attenuated and balanced malt body with none of the astringency issues Ive noted before.  Upping the score a little and hoping that from here on out the consistency keeps this a 4+ beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
