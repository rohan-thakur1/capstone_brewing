1173,"2016-05-19",3.9,"750mL growler filled 4/29/16 and drunk 5/4/16.Heavily hazy/cloudy peach-golden with deeper rust tints and a large, very-well-retained white head.Big juicy fruit, sweet pine, ruby red grapefruit and marmalade notes are immediately boisterous and fairly intense, especially for Hill Farmstead. Malts behind it show rich honey tending to light caramel. Its funny, this is probably the 3rd or 4th mosaic IPA/pale ale where it comes off much less what I associate with mosaic. But blending hops can unlock and vastly alter a hop profile, so its not too surprising. Anyways, I usually expect tons of dank, leafy, slightly woody notes, with plentiful nectarine and pine. I guess theres a fair amount of that here, but Im surprised at all of the ruby red grapefruit and peachy-pine twang. Alcohol is well-concealed with just a moderate amount of resin lingering and no flaws.Juicy, of course, in the mouth, with rich nectarine, caramel, ruby red grapefruit and pine all blending together to add a powerful flavor. Kind of like Trilliums Scaled Up, but taken another notch past that on both malt, hop flavor and bitterness. Lots of honey-like maltiness with a touch of caramel. Tight carbonation leading to a malty-creamy texture and no flaw or alcohol. Theres a bit more resin than Id like and some heavy hop twang at points, but its still very juicy, intensely flavorful and enjoyable (if tending maybe a touch sweet).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1173,"2015-11-16",4.6,"750 mL growler. Originally reviewed 5/25/2013.

Hazy orange body with some sediment floating inside. Nice white head that nearly overflows the glass. Impressive sticky lacing down the sides.

 Incredibly complex aroma from what is effectively a single hop. Tropical fruit, citrus, pine, and a nice herbal character reminiscent of a Lawsons IPA. Really nice.

Taste is incredible, but doesnt quite reach the heights of the aroma. Citrusy, but the tropical fruits dont come through as much as the pine and herbal characters do. I go for tropical fruit more than the other flavors, but its still excellent. Just a little bit of sweetness behind it all.
Low sweetness, medium carbonation. Not quite the body of a double IPA, which is nice. Never feels heavy and is impressively drinkable.

Stunning, as always, from Hill Farmstead. That one hop is delivering all of this flavor is all the more impressive.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
1173,"2015-11-12",4.2,"Huge thanks to sideshowe for picking this up for me!

Pours a cloudy golden orange color with banana yellow edges and a one finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Good retention with large streaks of soapy lacing coating the glass. 

Floral, earthy hop aroma with resinous, grassy pine notes along with a subtle sweaty/onion-y character that countered by tropical and citrus fruit sweetness and a pale malt backbone. Not very familiar with mosaic hops but this beer smells pretty complex. Dank and sticky with hints of spruce tip, grass and pine needle followed by subtle citrus rind, grapefruit and pineapple. Again, some vegetal, onion/scallion character with some bread and biscuit underneath. 

Full bodied with a slightly creamy texture and a blast of earthy, sticky hops which provide crisp, dry bitterness that lingers over the sweeter fruit notes and pale malts into a dry finish. Aggressive bitterness up front with resinous oils and grassy pine needle flavor. Theres also a bit of that onion like character but its not as strong as the nose suggests and fades a bit after it warms and the palate adjusts. The bitterness is countered by subtle citrus and tropical fruit notes, especially grapefruit, mango and lemon peel. Underneath, there is a pale malt backbone thats strong enough to perfectly balance things out without interfering with the hops. Some bread/yeast character along with biscuit and graham cracker. 

The most surprising aspect of this beer is how drinkable it is. Even though its full bodied and aggressively bitter up front, its perfectly balanced by the sweeter notes and malt backbone. Complex and flavorful with a crisp and refreshing finish that leaves me immediately craving another sip. I had to slow myself down and savor it before I blazed through the whole growler. Another great beer from Hill Farmstead!","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

1173,"2014-03-04",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Tropical fruit juices burst from this Double IPA, leading the way to grassy hop resins and their salient bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam laces atop the cloudy blond.
-The pungent bitterness detracts from the drinkability, but then again this IS a Double IPA...
-The tropical fruit character spans from passionfruit to peaches, from guava to plantanes, from citrus to lychee.
-Alcohol is not bothersome at all.

1173,"2013-06-06",4.5,"In short: A highly aromatic, pillowy, fruity, uber-hoppy blond ale with a relatively smooth bitterness.  Drinks like a session beer.
How: Tap at Blackback Pub, Waterbury VT.  Then a growler at home consumed the day of purchase.
The look: Cloudy apricot-color body topped by a medium white head with good retention.
In long: Except for Society & Solitude #2 which was a enormously hoppy black ale most entries in the S&S series are variations on a common theme.  Same great HF blonde beer body, signature HF cushiony mouthfeel, as usual highly aromatic, typical low sweetness sensation and dangerously drinkability, and so on and so on  So whats different about this one?  The hopping is predominantly fruity  with piney undertones.  The fruity part focuses more on peaches, mangos, pineaples, other tropical fruits, this means not much grapefruits and lemons and this makes for a less sharp and less biting bitterness even if the beer is hopped to the max.  Maybe my favorite entry in the series, right up my alley.

Aroma is pretty much all hops with only some faint cracker malt character. Hops are very fruity with lots of citrus and tropical fruit with a bit of a vinous character. 
Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a pillowy white head. Light lacing and medium low legs. 
Flavor is very hop forward with some light biscuit and cracker malt character. The hops are very vinous with moderate tropical fruit notes and some light citrus but the citrus is fainter. The bitterness is high but clean. Moderately dry. Slight alcohol spice in the finish. Tastes a bit less than perfectly fresh. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodies with medium low carbonation. Astringency is low and only due to the hops. Alcohol warmth is medium low.

Some earthy grass and florals, firmer bitterness but nice hopping, solid bitterness, weeds, and florals. Initial is considerably more pleasant, lemon and florals meet, some gentle grapefruit, a bit of juicy citrus. Lemons, florals, grass. Firmer bitterness, a bit of juicy middle. Small malt bill is bready, crisp, and gentle cereal. Fruity touches of mango, some more grapefruit. Smaller body, firmly bitter, but not as intense or flavorful as I expected. A lot of melon into middle and backend. Good fruit as it warms a bit more. Pretty tasty. Nicely bitter. Good flavors as it warms. Comes into its own much more with melon and grapefruit.

A touch of toasty malt as well. Really nice aromatics. On tasting, it has a good tropical fruit and resin thing across the palate, but then in comes some candy-like sweetness. Almost like orange marmalade that I dont like. Its a bit sticky and a hint of booze. Its a shame, the mosaic is used right here but the malt-hop combination doesnt work for me.

Odd pithy and pinnapple juice finish that is cloying. Long peppery booze finishes. Not really into the finish of this beer. I always have trouble with these double pales, just seems like they would be better suited to just up the bitterness more and just make a iipa, since they come off as weak/sweeter iipas anyway.

Pours s semi-hazy peach apricot orange brown, homogenous throughout, and topped with a frothy white head that dissipates to a thin wispy film... Aroma has a hoppy bitterness that youd expect with a citrus grapefruit focus upfront with more of a juicy lightly dank tropical fruit feel taking over halfway through and lingering from that point forward. A pale clean malt bill accentuates the aforementioned... Flavors follow suit to a tee and fortunately so.  Dank herbal tropical fruits that mosaic usually serves up in a very clean and presentable manner.  Additional notes of citrus and grapefruit and its associated pithy rind bitterness that rounds things out and prolonging through the finish. A touch of sweetness through the middle before the bitterness catches up pin the end. Medium bodied or seems just shy thereof.  Drinks very easy and no sensing of the abv untill after after I crushed my pour so fast.  Just what I was looking for and delectably executed.  Another winner but I may like 5 a whisker more?

1173,"2013-03-13",3.9,"2 Litre growler fresh from the brewery. Enjoyed at a painfully cold fridge temperature in a Teku glass. Side-Note, already 24 reviews on this beer? Man, Hill Farmstead is blowing up. Never seen an HFS IPA get so many reviews so quickly. 

A -  Looks similar to almost every other DIPA from Shaun. A sort of cloudy peach color with a minimal fast fading solid white head.

S - The nose is awesome. Very tropical. Lots of mango and pineapple. Sort of an orange peel scent as well. 

T -  Incredibly hoppy. IBU has to be high 90s and that may be the only downside to this beer. The taste is great, also carrying that pineapple but with the added pine cone character with lemon zest. Its a very fruity beer but the lingering bitterness lingers for a little too long and youre forced to drink more to get the bitterness off the palate. 

M - Medium body, really nice carbonation balance. For someone who has had a lot of cough syrup lately (recovering from the flu), it does have that booziness at the finish.

O - This is a great IPA but not my favorite in the Society series. 5 and 2 really shine as the winners here. Still, a great beer from a great brewery.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

1173,"2013-03-07",4.6,"On tap at the brewery. A hazy golden pour leaves a massive white head that leaves thick heavy lace, and lasts throughout the glass. Mosaic has quickly become one of my all time favorite varietals from my own brewing exploits, so it was super interesting to see how Hill Farmstead incorporated it into a hop forward beer. The hop itself reminds me of a cross between Columbus and Citra. Huge herbal pungent dankness with hints of scallion (Summit in nature, but not quite to the same degree), leading to a bursting onslaught of berry, nectar fruit, and tropical fruit. Very light and unobtrusive malt character, letting the vibrant nature of the hops shine. The body is light and crisp for the style, but the palate fills up nicely with caressing effervescence. Super dry finish. Very grateful to have shared this with great company, and looking forward to more in the future!","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"

Its hard to think of another DIPA I would rather drink more of in one session. The alcohol is well-hidden, its very-well balanced, and the flavor profile is simply right-on.

Pours a hazy light straw golden amber with a large white head that fades to a thick collar and film with patchy clumps of lace.  Aroma starts with sweaty and juicy tropical hops: mango, passion fruit, tangerine, and lime.  Theres also some bready and pale malt and some grass and pepper spice on the finish.  Flavor starts from the front of the palate bitter and peppery that persists throughout the sweet and fruity body.  There is a persistent doughy malt base that blends nicely the grassy hop bitterness and juicy tropical notes.  Fruit presence tends more toward tangerine, nectarine, mango and citrus skin than the nose.  Full bodied, with soft carbonation and a dry, smooth finish.  Aftertaste of resin, grass, bread and hoppy bitterness.  I like the mix of styles of beer in this series instead of sticking to just making massive IIPAs showcasing a different hop each time.
