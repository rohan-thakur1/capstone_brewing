3231,"2016-06-01",2.9,"Pours a very hazy deep yellow. Thin white head that leaves some very nice lacing. Crisp lager aroma. Traditional lager beer. Nothing outstanding. Slight band-aid flavor in the finish.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","screigh"
3231,"2015-11-05",3.2,"Enjoyed at a tasting hosted by Brian on October 22. Thanks for the post-birthday hosting man! Poured from a 22 oz bottle. I didnt know that Three Floyds made a pale lager. This should be, well, something. The pour is a golden yellow from the bottle with a large frothy white head and some pretty good lace as it quickly fades away. The aroma is definitely lager. There is additionally some light lemon, light malts, and a touch of metallic that no lager would be complete without! The flavor is initially dominated by the lager yeast before offering some of the citrus and maltiness on the back end. Its just pretty plain. The mouth feel is light, hardly carbonated, and reminiscent of a fizzy water. The aftertaste is lingeringly malty and metallic, with a hint of lemon to it. I didnt know they made one, and I think it would be a good idea if they stuck to their guns. Not awful, but they shouldnt waste time on beers like this.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3231,"2015-09-24",3.0,"22oz bottle from the brewery pours a hazy gold with some frothy, white head. Nose has yeast, lemon, mild malt, some sweatiness, some passion fruit. Flavor has more passion fruit, some soapiness, light yeast, some unripened pear. Dry finish. Fine, but far from exciting.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
3231,"2015-09-11",3.0,"Pours pale yellow with a full white head. Yeasty bread aroma. Semi sweet bread taste with a hint of citrus. A mild finish with a hint of citrus hops minutes later.

3231,"2015-08-11",3.8,"On draft at the GTMW pre-party. Golden pour with a medium white head. Aroma is citrusy and tropical. Bright, crisp, hoppy flavor with medium bitterness towards the backend. Finishes crisp and hoppy. Wonderful.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
3231,"2014-11-06",2.7,"Tap at Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL. Clear light golden pour with a small spotty white head. Soft grain. Semi-sweet. Lager yeast. Good for the style.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
3231,"2014-09-13",3.2,"Cloudy pale gold pour with no head. Aroma is fruity. Slight bite and a little grain. Light mouth. Taste is full of grain and tart fruit. Dry finish. Pretty nice for a relatively subdued lager. Reminds me of drinking in the Czech Republic.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","dinkle50"
3231,"2014-08-13",2.8,"Draft sample. About as nondescript for a lager as you can get. Sure better htan a light lager but notby much.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

3231,"2014-08-05",3.4,"Draft at Hop Leaf. Cloudy yellow pour with sticky white head. Has that German beer smell and taste to it, but not in the unpleasant way it can be. Lemon and yeasty. Decent for the style - nothing less expected from three floyds","Chicago, Illinois, USA","kaser"
3231,"2014-08-05",3.3,"Draft to taster. Looks solid; a mostly transparent light gold with foamy white head. Smells of citrus hops and lager yeast. Tastes like it smells with a citrusy but smooth mouthfeel. A nice, hopped-up example of the style.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
3231,"2014-08-04",3.4,"[Tap] Pours a golden color with a fizzy white head. Soapy lacing clings to the sides of the glass. Light aroma of grains, floral hops and mild grass. Light malts, crisp light hops and straw are the main taste contributors. Comes together very well. Clean and tasty. Good body for the style. Youve got to give credit is due. Not a great style, but impressive for what it is.","Illinois, USA","troyc"
3231,"2014-08-03",2.6,"Tap at the source. Its a pale lager. Probably the best that it could be for the style, but its still more old style than zombie dust.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
3231,"2014-08-02",3.0,"On tap at Kumas Corner. Poured slightly hazy yellow with super thin head. Aroma almost nonexistent hop and citrus. Light carb med bod. Taste is sweet malt.","New York, New York, USA","charule"
3231,"2014-08-01",3.6,"Draft on tap at the brewpub (Munster, IN). Was really excited to get this one. Pours a nice decent hazy orange gold hue, a bit darker overall, dulled with a cakey big whitish head atop. Nice glow, good lacing and stick around overall. Aromas are stark grain, bread and straw meet some earthy spice, yeast. A bit earthy, gentle florals, faint lime rind grows with some citrus jabs. Initial is lighter end of the fold in body, crisp and bready with a lime/citric juicy bite. Straw, bready malts and touches of fruit. Middle is a bit more citric, lime rind and gentle body with some spiciness and fizz into the backend. Faint tartness, kiss of apple. Earth, bread, subtle fruit trail out. Hops are gentle, compliment but let that light crisp grain and citric fruit do the work, refreshing. Light but no slouch, pretty crushable overall. Nose is mellow, looks nice, really works well flavorwise on the palate. Others might not be as enamored by this but I dig it.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
