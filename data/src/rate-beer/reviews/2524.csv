2524,"2017-04-21",2.8,"On my last six pack from a case (over several weeks). Aroma is great with plenty of citrus. Smells great. Taste is OK however it doesnt quite live up to the promise of the aroma. Visually a clear amber fluid. Consistently no head retention which is disappointing. Sometimes it is the glass but after 18 cans into various hand washed and thoroughly rinsed glassware it is safe to say that it is the beer this time. Palate is a little thin, watery and overly carbonated - but only slightly on all those points. One of the better lower alcohol beers I have purchased.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","DavidAust"
2524,"2016-12-22",3.3,"From can in pint glass. Pours golden amber with wispy white head that dissipated quickly but body remained highly carbonated. Excellent hop aroma of citrus, apricot and maybe a hint of passionfruit. CO2 levels make for a lively palate with a hint of bitterness in the finish. A refreshing beer good for summer (or designated drivers).","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","ANZUShophunter"
2524,"2016-07-09",3.4,"330ml bottle into schooner glass. Cloudy amber beer with a huge white head. Nice fruity aroma with a whiff of malt. Light body. Creamy, fruity taste. Finish has pineapple, bitter lemon, mango, caramel. Great refreshing beer, irrespective of the ABV.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","TedE"
2524,"2016-01-08",3.2,"(Bottle) Clear golden amber with good white head. Lovely aroma - pine, citrus, hints of stone fruit. Light body, good carbonation. Taste is a little thin, but good for a mid strength. Tart fruity start with nice hoppiness from mid palate. Excellent mid strength beer.

Aroma of citrus hops/grapefruit. Taste semi sweet with hoppy citrus/grapefruit. Light body. Crisp, clean, dry with a nice moderate lingering citric bitterness on the finish. Easy drinking. Very nice for a light beer.","Tarragindi, AUSTRALIA","KeefOz"

Well carbonated and apricot in colour this beer carries a fair bit of aroma and flavour for such a low alcohol beer. Definitely a beer that you could keep coming back to.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
