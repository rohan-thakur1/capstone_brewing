Malt Liquor Dexterity Games Tournament to celebrate my birthday. Keeping in mind that most of the participants are not regular beer raters, here we go: dark amber body, sweet sponge toffee, light marmalade, sticky and doughy, no hint of the ABV, actually very tasty regardless of the style, barleywinish, sweet fruity malty muddy, english hops?, sweetness gets cloying, spicy notes, Dave from Wendys first, not horrible but a little flat, surprisingly I enjoyed this, great flavour and scent, caramel soft nice, sweet and strong and deep and dark, makes my mouth malty, pretty smooth for a malt.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

Sweet flavour of malt and caramel, with bitter notes of hops and, above all, alcohol. Bitter aftertaste.
