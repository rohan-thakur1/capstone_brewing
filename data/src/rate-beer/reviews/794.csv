Midnight Wheat pours a slightly hazed garnet with deep rich mahogany highlights into a weizen glass. A 1 finger beige head formed on the pour that faded rather quickly to a solid cap. Leaves lacing after each sip that slowly falls back into the body.

The aroma starts off with a big helping of caramel and doughiness. There is a slight copper twang along with a subtle but obvious roasted malts.

Very smooth and balanced flavors. Much like the aroma caramel and a nice doughiness go hand in hand and are the main flavors. Sight copper twang in the flavor as well that actually contributes to the taste. Mild spicy hop finish along with the roasted malt acidity. Very impressive.

Medium bodied with a velvety smooth texture. Coats the tongue momentarilly but glides through with no problems. 

Very easy drinker. I could easily enjoy a few of these in a sitting.

This is a high quality brew and Im glad I had the opportunity to give this a try. Hopefully this beer will be around so I can pick up more. Very enjoyable and a good value.

794,"2006-07-08",2.4,"Bottle (no date, though most likely a 2005) consumed on 7/3/06.Small light-tan head is poorly retained, providing no lacing.  Head fades to cover/partial-cover.  Body is a deep black-brown, with some deep mahogany tints.  Sediment remains on bottom, but the beer shows a low clarity.Strong chocolate graham crackers in the nose, with sweet, rich honey and milk chocolate.  Not much lager yeast here, no mention of crispness.  A touch of smokiness (phenols) and dry buttered bread, but most of the character is drowned out in heavy malt sugars.Some very light clove phenols provide some light dryness, that bites at the palate, but are fully washed away in a sea of caramel malt sugars.  I dont know if something went wrong with the carbonation in this bottle, but its shockingly low, leading to a thick, syrupy, cloying palate that runs anywhere from chocolate, to honey, to caramel.  Even without much carbonation , this still seems HIGHLY underattenuated.  Hop notes are certainly nowhere to be found in this sugary concoction.  They werent kidding about the double decoction, I guess.  Hopefully I just got a severely undercarbonated bottle (still questionable about the attenuation).  Will certainly try it again as soon as possible.This bottle was kept in my refrigerator since purchase.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Add to that brown sugar, some dark dried fruits, and a dab of chocolate.

At first I was thinking that they just fermented cool, which would have left the hefeweizen yeast flavors muted, but after reading the description, I guess they blend the hefeweizen with a black lager which explains the muted hefeweizen flavors.

Or is it just my imagination?  Well balanced, toasty & wheat malt flavor, hints of caramel; clean, no fruitiness.  Finish is on the dry side, light roasty/bitter aftertaste.  M/f is dry, but rich & smooth @ the same time.  Fuller med. body, higher carb.  Very good, and different beer!

794,"2004-11-09",3.9,"I must Thank my friend BeanDip for giving me one of her rare beers. 
 Midnight Wheat must be named due to the dark, almost opaque crimson body. The head is a thick froth of tan foam. The aroma and flavors brings toasty suggestions of pumpernickel bread, somewhat crusty yet doughy. Tart wheat beginnings and a some what sweet, nearly a light molasses like finish. There are some really nice proposals of chocolate, even a touch vanilla can and will be found. I dont know what it could be, but I undoubtedly note a dark berry presence; like blueberry or a blackberry with a hint of clove?  
 This Dunkel has a very rustic and natural feel and flavor. It honestly evokes some strange thoughts of Midlevel warriors or Bavarian royalty drinking from a stoneware stein that is wrapped in stitched leather ... or maybe Im just a strange bird? 
 Overall, I find this to be one intriguing brew! It kind of has that Belgian farmhouse thing going on?","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

As it warms, toffee, walnuts, and soft roast accompany the peppery yeast suggestions.  Appropriate spritz, but fairly watery. Dense, oily body. Modest flavors of unsweetened chocolate and tangy leather. Bready malt backdrop curtails the spicy anise bite, but fails to augment the light body.  Myriad of clove and banana esters from the vivacious yeast. Cotton and oxidized black malts roughen the slippery body. Waning malt sweetness in the finish, with chalky yeast textures backing the yogurt and dried plum acidity. Yeast pour accentuates the spicy Weizen flavor while reviving the earthy malts of the base Lager.
