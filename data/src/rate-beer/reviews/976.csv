976,"2015-07-27",3.9,"Draft at the brewpub. Darker orange-brown. Small stringy head. Nice yeasty-amber aroma, kind of a house flavor. Body washes over with complexity. White wine yeasty-tartness throughout, some earthy grain. Dries out nicely. Tart, juicy, hop note comes through too. I really dig this.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
976,"2015-07-07",3.8,"Bottle @ RBSG 2015. Thanks to Eugene. Milky straw colored beer with a ton of white foam. Has a lot of straw, some strawberry, and a bit of grass. Light citrus rind and oak, too. Flavor has more grape/wine flavor than the nose lets on. Theres a nice touch of citrus, melon, and fruit skins. Quite dry and highly carbonated. Subtle yeast and funk. Pretty nice all around.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
976,"2015-06-22",3.8,"750mL bottle, pours a clear blonde with a medium white head. Aroma brings out lots of Belgian yeast and white wine barrels. Flavour is very vinous, with lots of white wine and Belgian yeast. Highly carbonated but fitting for what it is. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

976,"2015-04-26",3.6,"Tulip at brewery. Thick dark golden color, cant see through it. Aroma is brett- tastic (wild, faintly oily, and whatever horseblanket is) with slightly estery spikes. Flavor is less wild with more herbal brettiness and a good deal of sweetness still leftover. Slightly slick with tingly mouthfeel with a long herbal Brett aftertaste. Like the aroma much more than flavor, needs a little less sweetness but still keep the body.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
976,"2015-04-05",3.9,"On tap @ Holy Mountain. Pours dark hazy orange copper with thin lacy white head. Aroma is huge floral fruity tartness with a dry earthy funk note just behind. Taste is clean pale malt with big white wine flavor on the back. Some oaky barrel notes as well. Rich flavor on the light body. Really unique and flavorful.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"
976,"2015-04-04",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2015 On tap at Holy Mountain. Pours a hazy orange, with a soapy head. Dusty, barnyard funk, and this one has a lovely direction, though doesn?t seem quite finished yet. It?s something of a great sour without the bite. Low carb, and the wood comes in late. Rushed? I?d love to try it again in a few months to see what happens. UPDATE: A few months later, this has dried out and the tartness had died down considerably. Definitely blending the flavors that were there before into a more unified palate. This definitely seems more mature now. Better!","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"
976,"2015-03-26",3.9,"Draft at Holy Mountain. Hazy gold pour, white head. Aroma: bretty (because thats a meaningful descriptor, right?); somewhat floral, winey. Dry, moderately bitter, oily texture. This is a short little rate, which will be revisited more thoroughly from the bottle in the future, but couldnt stand to see this sit here with 0 ratings. Drinks real nice, and Im looking forward to what the bottles bring. Incidentally, this is the first beer ever commercially bottled by holy mountain for those of you keeping score.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
