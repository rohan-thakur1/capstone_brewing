16,"2016-06-22",3.8,"Shared 32 oz. crowler brought back from AZ. by the Kaiser, and poured to snifters displaying a cloudy, light gold color, with a sudsy layer of white head foam that gradually reduced to a thin ring, and dots & dashes of lacing. The nose offered some sweetness, grassiness, esters as lemon, mandarin orange, and berries, boasting pleasant tanginess, tartness, and dryness. Light to medium bodied, with carbonation that was undoubtedly lessened by the trek, but still moderately lively, the taste was similar notes, with a heightened lemony nature, some salinity, and a nicely dry finish. The blood orange made this particularly unique. An exceptionally fine example of the style.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

16,"2016-06-08",4.3,"Poured up on tap at the brewpub where it exhibits a murky opaque deep gold body that has copper hues and supports a near white head of foam. The aroma offers up a light salt infused soda and a punchy orange tart sensation with a faint light maltiness in the background. The taste is chewy and citrusy yum and then heading into a bit if salt and then a thin a thin acidic bite. It pulls up some pleasing cracker maltiness that finishes this off in style. This is just dynamite as its crisp fresh and slammin good. As it aged a few more weeks the deep rich citrus slowly turned into more and more tartness.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
