Very authentic fruit character as always from these guys, with earth, spice and strong honey-vanilla backing it. Great strength of aroma and low alcohol while exceptionally clean.Very, very tart and tannic in the mouth, the soft, sugar-laden texture certainly comforts the palate, but Im less in love with the hard, nearly astringent acidity from the fruit here as opposed to most other, softer fruits. Of course, black currants are a very tart, astringent, acidic fruit and I like that its presented here, as is. Clean, low alcohol and wonderful, lush fruit flavors and sugars abound. Hard to imagine these guys making a bad mead.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

It has a kind of vegetable-ish aroma which I just kinda think is what black currant tastes like. Like I said, not crazy about it. Its very sweet, sticky w/ a fair bit of tartness which brings out some nicer berry flavors. A bit of tannin seems to bring balance to the finish.

4118,"2016-02-07",4.5,"375 mL skinny bottle shared by ebone1988. Thanks broham! This baby is batch #04. The pour is amazing. Thick and heavy, dark purple with a little pink in the mix. There is no head, other than a couple small bubbles, bright purple in color, due to the pour. The aroma is very heavy. There is a lot of booze and a wine character to it. The currants are there in force, but the sweetness is a little overshadowed by the booze. The flavor is unbelievable. It starts a little hot, but the immediate aftertaste is magnificent. It starts a little tart, and slowly moves into a beautiful sweet currant. The sweetness is amazing. It's very jammy. The mouth feel is spot on. There is a good thickness with hardly any carbonation, and just a lingeringly coating, fruitiness. It's great. This is a spectacular mead. You would never guess that this was 14% by the flavor. The aroma gives it away, but this is the first mead I've really, really likes. Hot damn did Schramm's nail this.

4118,"2015-07-11",4.8,"375ml bottle courtesy of and shared with Meadme. First, I must say how hard it is to rate these meads.

How does one go from rating a traditional mead aged for 15 years to a fruit loaded Schramms thats nowhere near the same? yet this one sits in the top 5? Still, great stuff.

Couleur pourpre profonde , rien ne perce comme lumière. Huileux au verre.
Arôme est purement et simplement de cassis, comme ci on y avait verser des kilos de cassis. Retrouve un fin mielleux, terreux du fruit.

4118,"2015-04-04",5.0,"This is a perfect mead. For as amazing as Heart of Darkness is, this one is my Platonic Ideal. Wonderful aroma of jammy currants and rich honey gives way to a lush, full-bodied and viscous mead that coats your tongue with everything wonderful you could want. Batch 2 reduced the sweetness of Batch 1 by a couple percent, making it a bit easier to drink more of it without feeling like things got too cloying, but this is absolutely a sweet mead in the best of ways. All that sugar helps balance the tart currant bite and make each sip a wonderful little explosion on your tongue.

4118,"2014-09-05",4.1,"Bottle. Thanks Sean! I have a bias towards things that are Black Currant flavored and not nasty, because they help me connect with my childhood, so Im a little partial here, but this is very nice. Aroma glows of candied black currant juice and a distant hint of honey florals. So many meads Ive had lately reek of beeswax and not much else. This has none of that. Moderate sweetness is cut by black currant acidity and well integrated alcohols. Smooth, gentle and sipping. Very nice.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

4118,"2014-07-13",4.0,"very pretty, deep, near black purple, bright reddish showing through the thinner areas. very thick legs left behind; I feel like if I kept swirling eventually the entire drink would be stuck to the side; ha!
prominent grapey berry everywhere. rich, some alcohol but nothing solvent, very inviting. Floral honey is everpresent though well behind the strength of the fruit.
The flavor is nearly the equal of the nose in depth and richness. Incredibly sweet, but a decent amount of alcohol and of course ample berry tannin help out a bit. remains balanced towards sweetness no matter what I serve it at. chilling helped drinkability a bit, and soothed some of the more hotter alcohol notes, but muted the incredibly rich nose. Took me about 30 minutes to drink a few ounces before going back for a couple more. Ill have to revisit this one in the cold of winter.","Kansas, USA","udubdawg"

The tall thin glass bottle pours with a deep purple body that has red to rosy red hues and exhibits thick glass staining legginess.

The taste unleashes smooth rich juicy dark grape concentrate with a depth that runs deep underground. At the edges of the berry nectar goodness are thin berry skin like tart tannin notes that give this hints of balance amid the taste of rich sweetness.
