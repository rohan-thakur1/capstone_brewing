3731,"2017-06-15",3.6,"Draft - nose is butter, grass and caramel. Sip adds bread. Complex for the style and hoppy too.","Taylor Mill, Kentucky, USA","Chudwick"
3731,"2017-05-18",3.8,"12 ounce can poured into a brandy snifter. The beer is a dark amber color with a beige head of velvety foam. The aroma is toasted bread, flour, and an herbal, nearly earthy hop profile. Taste is sweet and doughy. Some caramel maltiness comes through in the taste. Medium body, higher carbonation. Dries out nicely to an earthy bite in the finish. Far exceeded my expectations.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"

3731,"2016-12-19",3.7,"12 oz canned 12 Aug 2016. Amber-red pour is clear and has a creamy disc of foam. Aroma of toffee, toasted grain and a hint of spicy apple. Tastes of toffee, mild citrus, apple and earthy bread. Starts sweet but has a slightly crisp, earthy finish. Near-medium bodied and delicately balanced with a pleasant, low-medium fizz. Very nice example of the style","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
3731,"2016-05-25",3.2,"Fort Myers, Fl - Total Wine - 12 oz can. Dark copper pour, thick, sticky off-white head, nice lacing. Aroma has some fresh lake water accents, a hint of wort. Flavor is sweet with some caramel notes, some molasses, a brief wisp of chocolate. Mouthfeel has a nice thickness to it.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
3731,"2016-03-29",2.6,"Another example of a red/Amber that has been overly hopped. I prefer the stuff on the maltier side.

3731,"2015-08-10",3.1,"On tap in Melbourne, FL.
Red-amber body has excellent clarity and is topped by very nice, creamy tan head. 
More erthy hops than expected, leaving this mildly bitter with a rather hoppy aftertaste. There are some toffee and dark bread flavors as well. Medium+ carbonation in a near medium body.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
3731,"2015-04-02",3.5,"Enjoyed a pint of this beer on tap at the brewpub. The beer had a deep ruby red color and was mostly hazy with a large, creamy tan head with great retention, and good cling and lacing. The aroma had a pleasant blend of caramel malt and grain, along with some toffee and earthy characters. The taste was a pleasant and mostly sweet with a mix of caramel and toffee, and a subtle earthy bitterness. The beer had a good carbonation with a fairly smooth and wetter mouthfeel.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"
3731,"2015-01-16",2.9,"Tap at growlers pub Sarasota. Clear amber with small white head not much lacing. Not too much aroma but what is present is toasted light biscuit grain with a faint amount of hops. Sweet with some hints of red fruit, reminds me a bit of twizzlers. Some hops present with light pine notes. Overall the beer is drinkable but average by every means.","Sarasota, Florida, USA","stevencon"
3731,"2015-01-04",3.3,"Definitely a malt forward amber. Pours fairly dark, quite dark, with an off white head. Nose is roasted malt and caramel notes wit a pairing of hops, nothing too bitter though. Flavor has a little more bitterness with plenty of caramel malt. Not quite chocolatey though. Fuller mouthfeel. ItÂ’s not a bad amber, just a little heavier than the norm.","Florida, USA","tricyclist"
3731,"2014-12-23",3.5,"Pours a deep amber color with off-white head. A hint of pine on the nose with some citrus and caramel; follows onto the palate. Finishes with more malt notes.","Dallas, Texas, USA","TXBadger"
3731,"2014-11-16",4.7,"Motorworks Roll Cage Red Ale is very enjoyable -- simple but done well. Tropical fruit aroma coming off a dark crimson pour with a white head. Taste is that of savory tropical fruit flavors with a good malt backing. Very nice -- simple and good. Roll Cage is a delicious red ale.","Orlando, Florida, USA","sloshgator"
3731,"2014-11-01",3.1,"Poured a reddish amber color with aromas of light caramel and some grassy hops. Flavors are caramel, light chocolate and grassy hops. Not too great but drinkable.","Florida, USA","burg326"
3731,"2014-09-27",3.7,"Tap sample. Poured clear dark copper color with an average frothy off-white head that lasted and produced excellent lacing. Moderate toasted sweet malt and herbal hop aroma. Medium to abundant body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy complex sweet flavor with the same sweet finish of moderate duration. This beer would go well with spicy food or a cigar.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
