4079,"2013-12-21",4.8,"NOTE: this was drawn directly from a barrel at Cantillon Brewery in Brussels, Belgium. It is a blend of 2009-2010 batches of their spontaneous lambic. It can only be had at the brewery from what I understand. The description is a bit deceptive in that the beer is blended, but not triple blended as a gueuze would be (thus, flat).

Scene: me at Cantillon, ""can I get a glass of the lambic?""
Lady: ""yeah...oh, Im sorry, we have to get some from a barrel, I dont have any. Im very sorry.""
Me: (hardcore grin) ""Awesome. Can I take a picture?!""
Then we went to the barrel and she drew me up some lambic, which had bugs in it, which is awesome.

A: Flat copper ale with hint of haze. There are still 3 flies in my glass even after she tried to remove all of them (there were countless). Looks much like dark apple juice. No bubbles, no lacing; anticipated as much.

S: Smells of wood, brett, lemons, grapes (fermenting), eggs, meringue. Tough to really get a full wiff.

T: Initially, this hits the palate and tastes bland. In this phase you can taste mothers nature: soil, dried alfalfa, biscuits, lamb (yes, lamb). Then as I let the beer roll over the tongue, beautiful sour flavors emerge in tones of lemon, grapefruit, apple. Upon the finish, the buttery flavor reminds me vaguely of a short oaked chardonnay in French Oak (very low levels of oak). The finish is long and hard (thats what she said). This is truly the most multi layered beer Ive tasted to date, truly outstanding in the flavors and my diction cannot do it justice. 

M: Thin and flat, as anticipated. I acutally feel like carbonation on this beer would inhibit the nuances. The beer feels also like it has high surface tension: as though its beading over my tongue rather than soaking in.

O: This is an experience I will likely have only once, but certainly I will recall it so frequently. My wife will be tired of hearing this story over and over. One of my best experiences. If you ever have the chance, try this, and at 2 euro, its a bargain in my book.

4079,"2013-04-02",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2013 Amphora @ Cantollion on March 2013. Direttamente dallanfora, profumo di luppolo erbaceo ed intenso. Colore giallo tenue, con qualche traccia di aranciato. Pochi profumi ma molto caratteristici(Erba tagliata di fresco,  fiori di campo). Al palato il corpo è quasi assente. prima ci sono le note aspre tipiche della fermentazione spontanea e subito dopo un luppolato intenso che su una lambic è necessario al fine di non renderla acetosa.  carbonatazione totalmente assente (sennò non avrebbero inventato la Geuze)","Samarate, ITALY","Silvan7"

4079,"2012-10-07",3.8,"Draught from the amphora Plain yellow-orange beer without any head. Meaty esters imposing themselves on a very aromatic lambic (hints of elderflower?). Very little typical lemony/citrussy notes, usual for Cantillon. Much more spicy flavour than usual lambic. Both the meaty esters ànd the elderflower flavours returning in the mouth. Retronasal hops come up, slightly cheesy. No new aftertaste, flavours slowly dwindling. Light body, high attenuation - no change there! Something that really requires further investigation and experimenting! It would be a dreadful shame if this were to be a one-off try!  Jean, au labo, fieu!","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
4079,"2012-10-07",4.7,"Gravity fed from an impressive amphora suspended from the sealing @ Kwintessens 2012 - tap below the amphora - almost overlooked it at first - just had to ask a refill of this one - this incredibly, the best pure lambic I have had so far along with the young 3F lambic - about 8 to 9 months old this indeed still rather raw and unpolished beer but lambic doesnt have to be finished or perfect - this had a thickness and flavour to it that is unusual to this kind of stuff which teds to taste watery, simple and occasionally even somewhat dull at this age - the fullness and richness of this one is damn fine. just pure, dinging this more than most except maybe the finest of Cantillon pure lambics - the flavour is impressive on this. Most will probably not share my opinions, this stuff is getting on the far end of what is enjoyable but the richness is superb. Interesting, clear, darker coloured lambic , little bubbles, lightly milky. Nose is a very interesting an interesting clay smell, the amphora is deep within this stuff, smells like pottery store mixed with white clay, soft earthly white clay, soft, slightly falling apart citrus, touch of white pepper, the others appear to be picking up fruits beyond lemons but to me this is the soft soil of white clay, probably pure amphora stuff, this is the thing that they make pottery of, lovely that rich body and strong flavour for this kind of stuff, flat, full, tastes of amphora, white modeling clay, soft soil like in the fields, mellow citrus, turning almost fruity, mellowly tart citrus fruits blended in with the clay, light pepper getting darker and bitterer, deeper into the soil, bitter, darker, shades of clay, deeper into the soil and the amphora, incredibly stuff, not to sure what you can do with the remainder of this stuff, this is so alone standing, almost everything will clash with this I imagine, hope to get to drink this stuff again","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
4079,"2012-10-06",3.9,"Straight from the amphora at the brewery Quintessence.
Tastes even more bitter, as the normal young lambic.
The amphore really does smth with this lambic, its already more buttery, but still tastes like a young lambic, bitter and little citric.
Good, really good, lets see what it gives within 2-3 years.","BELGIUM","tquest"

4079,"2012-10-06",3.7,"Tap @ Cantillon Quintessence 2012. Straight out of the amphora through a  small valve. A definite twist from the usual lambic and barrel aging process. Instead Cantilon delivers a unique and subtle clay-like notes that bring lambic to a whole new level.
Arôme présente un léger bouquet houblonné, possible à cru laissant un léger nez fleuri citronné sur une pointe tropicale. Intéressant ici est ce profile distinct dargile-terracota donnant limpression de retourner dans le temps, et pour ceux qui ont déjà eu loccasion de faire une visité didactique dun musée de lépoque romaine reconnaitront le profile des amphores et ce côté argileux.

Palais est sec avec ce rappel typique du lambic qui ici na pas de changement radical du format boisé. On note bien le houblon, des notes fruitées et citronné laissant passer une faible pointe aigre. Le tout donne un palais unique qui pour ceux qui ont déjà pu boire dans un récipient en argile noteront de suite cet aspect terreux qui ici reste très subtile. Le profile reste assez léger, et cest pour cela que il sera bien de voir lévolution du lambic après un an.

Que dire de plus, au contraire de nombreux brasseurs qui font force de produire des bières gimmick, Cantillon a su développer une idée intéressante avec ces amphores. Le tout reste néanmoins très jeune, et il sera très intéressant de voir comment cela va évoluer au fil du temps et contribuera à développer le lambic.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
