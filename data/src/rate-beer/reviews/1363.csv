1363,"2014-07-21",3.8,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a clear mahogany color with a one finger head just off white foam. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading to leave a tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is quite heavy of caramel and brown sugar with a bit of a roasted malt aroma. Some light chocolate smells as well as some molasses and plum are there as well. Overall the aroma is rather sweet.

 Taste  The taste begins with a lightly roasted and toasted bready flavor with some sweeter notes of a fruity nature with some plum and cherry. As the taste advances, a caramel and molasses sweetness joins the flavor all while some flavors of a light coffee and chocolate come to the tongue. Some more grainy flavors as well as some more roasted flavors come to the tongue after the cocoa and coffee. At the same time, a bit of an earthy and herbal hop come to the tongue, and in the end, mix with the sweeter and roasted flavors nicely to leave a smooth, lightly toasted, and sweeter flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is average in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side. The average carbonation and body are rather a nice bled for the darker but yet very drinkable nature of the brew.

 Overall  For a dunkel lager this is on the slightly sweeter side, but very drinkable and quite enjoyable. A rather good easy drinking darker lager.","","Darkmagus82"

1363,"2014-07-20",3.7,"500 ml bottle bought at Gorgeous Wine & Cigar in Yuen Long.
Looks: Clear deep amber brown colour; One finger head and light-beige foam which lasts for 1 minute; Very good sticky lacing and fizzy carbonation. 

Aroma: Sweet roasted dark malt, with very fragrant strong caramel, light sticky toffee, sugar, light cream, light coffee, and faint lemony grass hops. 

Taste: Close to light sweet dark malt, with pretty strong roastyness, light nuts, strong caramel, shades of toffee, very light black coffee, light dark chocolate, molasses notes, Cola, light lemon, bitter hops and very sharp grass.

Body: Light. Thin and slightly slick palate. 

Mouth Feel: Dark malt in light body with strong roastyness, but nuttiness is light. Fairly low sweetness, molasses is only notes. Light touch but notable toffee, black coffee and chocolate. Pretty reserved in the malt but hoppy and confident. Yes!

Hoppiness: Faint lemon and grass nose. Expressive lemon and sharp grass in taste. Moderate bitterness to macth the dark roastyness for a quite astringent and malty finish.

After Taste: Quite dry; Roasty and light bitter to mouth.

Comments: This is pretty much my ideal Dunkel should taste like - potent roasty dark malt, nice caramel nose, very low sweetness, driven by good bitter hoppiness and good light touch of coffee, caramel and toffee palate. As a Dunkel, this seems reserved but in a nice way. Smart and very relaxing, Im glad I picked this for the evening. : )","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

1363,"2014-04-21",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 23, 2014 The appearance was a semi-dark brown amber colored body with a two and a half finger white foamy head that lasts about a minute before dieing into the body, foamy clingy lacing starts to spider web after about a minute; light carbonation is seen rising at a moderate pace.
The smell had sweet German malts, light banana, light chocolate.
The taste had a malty sweetness leading to a rich sweet dark aftertaste; sweet dark malty lingering finish.
On the palate, it sat at/about a light to medium in the body as it wants to show a heavier depth to it, but stays lighter to show a pretty good sessionable aspect to it. Carbonation runs really smooth and dark over the mouth and tongue.

1363,"2013-09-29",4.2,"This pours a fiery copper amber color with ruby hues. The light passes through effortlessly and it has the look of glowing embers. Dark but with perfect clarity. There are plenty of bubbles rising up form the bottom and a fat head of almost tan foam that fell slowly and left good lace. 

Nose is wonderful. its dark fruit but lightly. Its sweet sugary malt. Light caramel. Toasted grain, a bit nutty and a the lightest scent like coffee or unsweetened chocolate. To the delight of the nose there is a trace scent of lager yeast and that adds to the brightness of the nose. 

The taste is absolutely superb! First thing you will notice is that the body of the beer is soft from an overall mineral quality. Its not the least bit heavy but crisp and clean. Its as clear on the palate as it is in the glass. The fruits are raisin and fig, but they are not heavy or too rich. The toasted grain is amazing and rich with its natural sweetness at the forefront and the caramel to back it up. Little bit of toffee notes underneath to add depth to the malt. Then its nutty and bready too. It finishes dry with the overall tastes of the malts resounding at the back palate. There is just a bit of hop herbal in the finish to help it glide so gently. 

This is one amazing beer. It has an incredible lightness. It has every flavor that you love about dark beer, from dark fruit to coffee and yet its light. Its not chewy, its not thick, its not too sweet. The dry finish is something to behold as all that perfect toasted grain settles in to last and linger in the aftertaste.

1363,"2013-03-25",4.0,"I poured a 500ml bottle into a large mug. There was no freshness date.

Appearance: Very dark amber to brown proper hue. Translucent with carbonation visible. Forms a small, off-white, soapy head that mostly evaporates and doesnt lace the glass much.

Smell: Lightly sweet scent of confectionery flavors of toffee and caramel while still giving off a distinct lager aroma.

Taste: I have to admit I didnt have high hopes for Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel. Most German beers are pretty old by the time they reach America and buying one at the beer store is a gamble since many sit there for months on end. Since this isnt a generic pale lager I hoped the distinction would at least make it decent, if not good, but it wound up being very good. I cant believe theres this much flavor in this beer. Its the palate most Oktoberfestbiers are supposed to have but dont - a sweet, smooth flavor caramel and toffee thats not cloying or off-balanced.

You might almost call this an English brown ale in lager form. Plenty of caramel, candied apple, milk chocolate and roasted nuts throughout the palate. A slight increase in bitterness at the peak of the swig, but it quickly reverts back to its sweet malty base. I may even detect some smokiness in here as well. One of the most pleasantly surprising beers Ive had in a long time (thanks to whoever recommended I review it!). 

Drinkability: I compared the taste to that of a brown ale, but Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel also drinks like an ale. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thinner, bubblier side, but nothing spastic. It has a comfortable mouthfeel and a super smooth finish. Its quite refreshing while in the mouth and leaves an almost completely clean aftertaste. At only 5% ABV its extremely efficient for its size and also versatile since it could work in pretty much any scenario involving beer.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Swirling would kick-up a thin layer of foam each time.

Flavors were the same plus some toffee, mollasses, plums, raisins, light nutty and woody tannins, chocolate and coffee. Somehow dry and malty at the same time, rich but smooth. Dark and really delicious. Medium body, bready mouthfeel, nice table strength alcohol percentage.  It struck me as a refined, German-engineered version of an English porter.

Appearance: Pours out a clear, dark amber-brown body underneath an inch or two of light beige suds.

Smell: Oven-toasted dark German bread and nuts backed by a light roastiness, strewn leafy hop notes, and a far-off hint of chocolate-covered raisins.

Taste: Toasted dark bread, coffee-laced roasty malts with added tastes of cracked nuts, cocoa powder, and even some dark caramel. Reasonably sweet. Child-sized handful of raisins, faint hint of apple skin. Leafy, herbal hops with enough bitterness to support the sweetness. All the various flavors roll in and around and amongst themselves, everything nicely integrated until the drying, nutty finish.

Serving type: Served on draft at the Ayinger Haus across from Hoffbrau

A - Bright brown and almost red hues that complemented the base color of a typical lagers. A very cool color that makes you want to look again.

S - Not a whole lot on the nose. Slight sweet, yeast, and bread notes. 

T - Such a clean beer. The Germans do lagers so well and this one is no exception. The darker malts that make up the color and the bigger body also provided a bit more sugar but not overbearing. It was almost like a dark helles.

M - Pretty Good. A bit on the heavier side and a tad viscous but overall it worked well. Not overly carbonated

Pours a bright reddish-copper color when held up to the light. Out of the light, its a chestnut brown. Thin tan head but no real lacing. Cap sticks around throughout. The nose brings some lightly-sweet malt along with some caramel and a hint of nuts. The flavor is a bit sweet, focusing mostly on malt sweetness and a touch of caramel and toffee. Mouthfeel is light to medium with moderate carbonation. Pretty decent, but nothing Id go out of my way for.

So you get the chocolate (I didnt see the plum), along with some roasted malt, and the dry German hops. Then the state has a very subtle sweetness from the chocolate notes. Mild hops notes.

It pours into my DAB mug a nice perfect brownish red with an off white head that doesnt leave much lacing.

The smell is a bit light for a Munich Dunkel. Im guessing this will fall under the extremely drinkable and not as sweet Munich Dunkel category. It has some Munich malt and some caramel.

The taste is light but good and refreshing. This is a very traditional take at the style. It almost tastes no different than a Helles lager besides a bit less hops and a bit richer malt. It has a subtle nuttiness and roasted character as well.

It isnt the best Dunkel but it is worth a try.

This ones a very clear brown with ruby highlights and thick two inch slightly tan-tinted white head with fairly good persistence and little lacing.  Immediate aroma is heavily dark chocolate, though this dissipates quickly as more toasty-sweet malt nose kicks in.  A very light astringency lingers in the background, along with some of that chocolate.  Shes very smooth on the palate, with no detectable hop flavor, and a medium bit of bitterness thats most clear on the backend.  Flavor is generally toast and chocolate, the bitterness mellowing out the sweetness and lingering a bit past the finish.  Great brew.","New York, USA","Chronoflash"

Smell: The aroma has a light sweet caramel or toffee malt character.

Still does in the glass - that sweet, dry cerealish....cant get around that. Guess I like cat food cause this beer is awsome!

Still some dry cat food hanging around (Ive tried all my cats food before, so I guess Im an expert) but its better than average dry hoppy finish, mild malts and slight sourness is what really impresses me.

1363,"2008-11-27",3.5,"I still remember my very first black lager; what it was, where I bought it, and how much of an eye-opening experience it was for a beer newbie. A dark beer that wasnt a dark beer; she wasn’t heavy, thick, richly complex, and deep with alcohol warmth. Instead, she was light, clean and refreshingly flavorful with a delicate personality which instantly won me over. While I haven’t been able to locate that first dark lager, I instead have before me another fine German example in the form of the Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel. Let the seduction begin.She poured a clear black-brown with deep russet hues glinting in the passing light. A cream-colored thick head tops her off before fading into a thin tribute to her splendor. No lace to speak of, though she does poof up nicely with some teasing swirls. Breaking the surface is a nose rich with bready malts, sweet caramel notes, raisins, dark fruits, and faint citric esters. The initial mouthfeel and body are light and clean with a mild, frothy texture. Soft chewy bread and caramel notes are up to play first while bitter nuts and lemon zest follow a close second. Adding depth and succulence to her palate are dark fruity notes of raisins, black cherries, and plums. Grassy hops make a play for the middle of Ayingers Altbairisch Dunkels palate while a clean finish with only a mild aftertaste concludes her performance. It is a pleasant reminder that while she may be dark in color and richer than a light or golden lager, she is still a lager. Clean and refreshingly quaffable, she is perfectly balanced for the ultimate session beer.For the uninitiated, the idea of a dark lager is practically foreign matter to them and about as believable, much less enjoyable, as an alien abduction. Ayinger is here with their Altbairisch Dunkel to prove all that balderdash wrong with a very simple truth: taste me and you will see that there is nothing to fear. Nay, there is much to love and embrace instead.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

1363,"2008-09-16",3.6,"<b>15-Sep-08</b> <i>(500-ml bottle: Sample bottle from the ""local"" Merchant du Vin rep)</i>  Not that I needed a sample bottle from the importer to know how wonderful this dunkel is, but it serves as a good reinforcement.  Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel may well be the best example of the style imported into the United States.  Ruby-brown in color with stunning clarity, the beer is capped by an inch of dark-tan head.  The nose presents clean, rich aromas of chocolate, dark and toasty malts and a touch of earth along with a slight floral-hop backdrop.  Core flavors of toasty, chocolaty and lightly sweet malts abound with that rich, worty, melanoidin profile that’s characteristic of dark German beers.  Medium in body and carbonation, clean on the palate.  The head settles to a wide ring while leaving a few spots and patches of lace.  A classic example of the style, one of the best.<b>10-Nov-05</b> <i>(500-ml bottle: $2.69 at Windy City in El Cajon, CA)</i> I think Ayinger is one of my favorite German breweries whose beers are imported into the U.S.  Chocolaty and toasty malts are dominant in this tasty dunkel, with sweetness and bitterness being pretty mild.  The chocolate really takes over in the finish.  The nose is less chocolaty than the flavor, showing more of that dark, malty, worty aroma typical of many dark German beers.  Medium bodied and pleasantly carbonated.  The beer is a pretty medium brown color and is capped by a gorgeous tan head that builds to nearly two inches before gradually settling to a thin, complete and creamy layer.  Lacing is left in large patches.  Overall, not significantly better than most of the German dunkels I’ve tried, but better nevertheless.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

1363,"2007-08-30",3.3,"500ml bottle poured into a dimpled mug. Pours a clear reddish brown that is a beautiful ruby when held to the light. A dense creamy beige head diminishes to a thin cap on the surface. The aroma is somewhat muted and is all about the malts: sweet roasted malt with lighter notes of chocolate, nuts, caramel and toffee. Light-bodied and lively with a distinctly metallic finish. The flavor  is similar to the nose with a sweet caramel malt front and notes of chocolate and nuts. One addition to the flavor that was absent in the aroma is a lightly bitter mocha finish. I think that Id like this beer quite a bit if it werent for the metallic quality that I get at the end.

Some fruity tones appear on the tongue after the dry roasted nuts and coffee leave, but not firmly so. The mouthfeel was moderate for the style.

Ayingers Altbairisch Dunkel poured a crystal clear caramel brown with quite a few tiny rising carbonation bubbles. A 2 finger head formed on the pour and then receded to a half finger of frothy tan head. Leaves moderate lacing after each sip.

Smells of mouthwatering toasted grains and a very solid caramel backbone. A splash of cream is in the mix as well. This is a hearty smelling brew. I can pull out a very small amount of hops if I try hard enough.

Taste is big on bread dough. The caramel comes through rich and slightly sweet. Nice lightly toasted grain flavor compliments things nicely. Mild creaminess comes through as well.

Medium bodied and perfectly creamy. Velvety smooth mouthfeel.

This is a very easy drinker. I could definately se myself sipping on these all night long with no problem. Smooth and creamy without being filling.

Another winner from Ayinger. I havent tried one of their offerings yet that I havent truly enjoyed. Very good beer.

1363,"2006-12-08",3.5,"This was very good.  Light maltly aroma that reminded me of a Vienna.  Black and a small head; nothing remarkable about the appearance.  Flavor was a pleasant surprise, it had bitter malt and more smoke than I have ever picked up in this style, so much so it might fairly be called a smoked beer. Looking at the score I shouldnt have been expecting anything unpleasant, but this greatly exceeded my expectations.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"

Noble hop noted faintly with a bitterness to balance.  Palate is medium to light, moderate carbonation, and a mouthfeel that is somewhere between creamy and dry.  Finishes quickly and mostly dry with chocolate bready notes and some faint noble hops.

1363,"2006-11-26",4.2,"Pristine garnet. Dense ring of bubbles surrounds a creamy island of dirty-white foam. Clean, airy and perfumey nose dotted with aniseed, honeysuckle and a hint of creamed coffee, cocoa and toffee. Soft and fluffy carbonation fills the mouth. Slight carbonic acidity. Flavors are bright and expressive from the start, with a fresh bite of black licorice and pure milk chocolate, primarily. What little fruitiness exists is remarkably bright, and offers lift, vibrancy, and malt accentuation. Despite their subtlety, the malts are extremely deep, and range from toasted caramel to dusty hay as well as a light nuttiness. Attenuation is perfect, and allows just enough chocolate mousse and milk chocolate to exude brightly. Noble hops provide a supple yet relaxed honeysuckle sweetness which complements the caramelized malt and biscuity elements to perfection. Finishes raisiny and dry, but saturated with a lengthy assortment of malt residuals. An exquisitely crafted dunkel. The world needs more of this.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1363,"2006-11-26",4.2,"16.9 oz. bottle. Sweet, oily, slightly plummy classic German dunkel aroma. Bright, sparkling, gold-tinged brown color. Moderate amount of fluffy beige head. Surprisingly tart, hoppy flavor for a malt-oriented brew, and thats great for a hops lover like me. Very interesting, unique malt flavor that I cant put my finger on but that I really enjoy. Excellent flavors could stand to be a little stronger. Very crisp, fizzy, and satisfying to the palate and very drinkable. I am pleasantly surprised at just how tasty this beer is, given that malty German brown lagers arent my favorite style.

1363,"2006-10-26",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2007 2006 bottle drunk on 9/30/06.Dark beige-walnut colored head is very forthcoming and shows fine retention.  Light webs of lace are produced as it recedes down the glass.  The chocolate-amber colored body has deep auburn tints and demonstrates a medium-high clarity.Poignant touches of vinousness and berry-skins are peppered about a softly sweet, chocolate-caramel maltiness that deftly allows a crisp lager yeast bite to creep in towards the end, finishing dry and quite elegant.  Some definite traces of almonds, walnuts and light coffee beans arise from the dark malts and stretch the complexity.  A touch of grassy, dusty hoppiness is minimally noted.  Gentle on the nose, and with well-defined notes that work well together.  Medium strength of aroma, no alcohol apparent, no lagering/brewing flaws.Very sweet up front, moreso than the aroma would suggest, with a nougat and toffee creaminess, that blends nuttiness and light vinousness as well.  Some breadiness and light acidity from the dark malts begin to dry things out, while a robust carbonation helps pull apart the sweetness as well.  Light buttercream, coffee cake and vibrant berry-like melanoidins sit on the end, surviving the lightly crisp yeastiness.  Very delicate, as a dunkel should be, with nothing even remotely overdone.  Quite possibly, nothing here is going to rock your world, but the execution/brewing is near-flawless.  Perhaps a touch too much on the carbonation, and the finish could stand to be more biting for a lager, but the overall attenuation is well-done, and the flavors are quite elegant.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Taste is a little stronger in the dark fruit/raisin category, a small amount of bitterness noted, though it seems more from the malts rather than the hops.  I can pick up on coffee if I try really hard, though I cant tell if its because I have a decent palate or because in the description they throw that word in--kinda placeboish.

Big, chunky, rocky 2+"" tan head.  Falls to a nice layer of foam.  OK lacing, not much.  Aroma is not strong.  Dominating lager characteristics.  Noble german hops, not a lot of malt.  Maybe a tiny bit of a musty character.  Little malt - smake.  Sweeter as it warms.  Flavor - a littl bitter as it hits your tongue.  Overall nicely balanced.  Malty in the finish.  Little bit of spice (yeast character?)  Little smokey.  Was getting a metallic aftertaste in the beginning, but it mellowed.  Palate - nice and light, good amt. of carb., not too much.

Froths up into a big tan head in the stein; the aroma is molassas and plum, with a bit of leather and yeast and humus. As the beer warms, it takes on a strong,unmistakable, and curious if not as unpleasant-as-it-might-sound scent of agar. The flavor is not as sweet as Id expected, with smoky malt, bittersweet burnt sugar, hints of peat and corkboard. Despite adequate carbonation, the mouthfeel is a bit thin and round rather than crisp; the finish provides a bit of smoke-and-hops bitterness.

Aroma has a well rounded nuttyness to it backed by some fresh baked wheat bread that has a slight toasty edge. Clean and inviting with a peculiar softness to its waft that grows a bit in strength as it warms.

Taste is easy goin and clean with a nice softness to its overall character thats enticingly unique yet very Ayinger-like. Something about the combo of flavors and carbonation makes for a very pleasant experience bringing a nutty wheat bread grain that sits remarkably clean and well rounded. Fluffy and delicate in nature, yet just enough boldness in the flavors to raise the eyebrows more then once. Notes of dusted cocoa and smokeyish sweet malt play with touches of caramel. Bread tones dominate taste, form, and function with this one though.

Feel is wonderfully soft and bready, warm bready is more like it; great, delicately precise carbonation with a semi-light chewyness to its bready nature.

I liked everything about this beer. Its not a brute by any means in huge amounts of aroma and flavor. But whats there sets perfectly for what it is, its very natural tasting and feeling.

20080927  Okay, so it’s been a while and this is due a re-rate.  The weird thing is that my description from 2004 andthe other experiences does not change.  I get the same flavors, mild aromas, and slight mineral characteristic, however, it’s fair to say that now I quite enjoy the beer.  Ah, tastes change and we grow to appreciate the finer things, as they say.  Well, it took longer that for any other style but in the last year or two I’ve come around on dunkel.

It slid back to a generous lacing down the sides of my wheat beer glass. Tastes are of roasted malts, espresso notes, sweet caramel, and some English toffee. Medium mouthfeel coats the tongue well, but its not sweet or cloying. Some alcohol notes in the middle, leading me to believe its in the 6% ABV range.

The taste is definitely on the sweet end, dark earthy fruits with notes of smoke in the finish. So quaffable that you basically feel the water quality used in this concoction was as good as it gets. Aftertaste is... fresh, like I had just brushed my teeths with more toothpaste than I should have used.

My father, a judge, has always tried to equate beer with criminalism, but with this beer he has finally given in and sat back and chilled the fuck out. Other than the obvious social implecations this has for me, it was a rather interesting yet modest beer. The complex malt has a definite sweet nature, but yields to a smokiness that is quite nice.

It had a light tan head, with an aroma of malt along with a  hint of alcohol.  The taste was a bit dry, and because it started out cold was not as malty as I would have liked.  The dunkel as it warmed up began to release a malty sweetness to my flavor receptacles.  At first when cold the predominant taste was in the finish, it was one of bitterness from the hops.  When warmed the maltiness balance out and in fact dominated the previous bitter hoppiness.  I detected a hint of raisin, some caramelized breadiness.

1363,"2003-07-03",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2005 Rerate: 5-11-2005.  Bottle, lager glass.  Thick, rich and creamy off-white head sits on a robust light maroon hued beer that tends to a dark amber where the glass thins.  Effervescent carbonation replenishes the head.  An absolute looker, wow.  Immensely rich malt aroma: cookies, treacle, toasted dark bread, molasses and a touch of semi-sweet chocolate. Ever so soft floral hops.  Intriguing hints of strap leather.  Delicate notes of dark raisins, port, tobacco, vanilla and honey.  Wonderfully complex from what is assuredly a simple malt bill and a clean yeast.  Clean and firm malt sweetness is offset by a very light acidic tang the the front of the mouth.  Finishes much the same with the addition of a soft floral hoppiness.  Theres quite a nice transition of aromas to flavornot much is left out.  Perhaps a bit less sweet than the aroma indicates.  Smooth and velvety mouthfeel is of moderate substance and is accompanied by a well-suited, lively carbonation.  Amazing how such a malt-focused beer can come across so drinkable and non-cloying without being watery.  Fantastic.  Wow, I used to be a beer idjit.Confirms my belief that Im just not a huge fan of lagers.  Very rich malt profile; lighter than the color would make you believe.  Funny aftertaste dries out the mouth.  Rerate 8/5/03:  Great cookie / caramel malt profile, but not much else.  Could do with a little more hops or some spices.  My original rating stands.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

1363,"2003-01-14",3.9,"Yeah...like i have anything else better to do at 4 in the morning than drink beer??? This was another winner from Ayinger..coming to be a name to trust. The aroma begins with hints of malt, a whopping cherry-like sweetness, and a nice whiff of doughiness. It pours a fiery red color, fairly clear at that, with a nice row of carbonation, a moderately thick beige to tan colored head, and left a nice defree of lacing on the glass. The taste definitely attacks the back and sides of the tongue. The roasted malts linger and give way to a cranberry aftertaste, mildly acidic, and that eventually leads into a malt/fruit/plum mix in the final aftertaste. The aroma does grow in intensity now and then as i progress through this wonder...something grapevine-like, but pleasantly refreshing after a hard nights work. Good use of the little bubbles, and not overboard with the roasty afternotes (which FINALLY just started to kick in)..im really digging that fruit ending which gets stronger by the minute..a nice building surprise..definitely a winner.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

Perhaps a bit of dried fruit as well.  Very mild hop presence in the nose, edging in at the back of the class, trying to avoid making a scene.  An average body--not too thick, but leaves the tongue wholly satisfied.  The flavor profile does indeed continue to show that sweet, clean malts are the dominate force for this beer.  From beggining and through the middle, its all malt.  And just as you begin to think youll ride this out to the end, the subtle hop character comes out and gives the sweetness a touch of earthy, spicy bitterness with which to interact and experience.  Ultimately, this is never going to blow your socks off, but its going to be a damn fine, pleasing beer, through and through.January 12, 2003   Pours a light brown/ruby color with a light, quickly dissipating head.

1363,"2002-12-16",3.5,"not the best choice to consume after a couple winter ales, im about malted out. this one has some additional depth tho, and perfumy richness to it.  a chestnut amber presentation rather than the tootsie-roll brown typical of many dunkels. a lax head still sheets and undulates in pretty riverine wisps and oxbows. decent nose has well-worn leathery, earthy scotch peat and coffee tones. to visualize the fragrance in my mind, i pictured an ancient pillar of rotting pine trunk in a forest glade: sappy, lightning struck and bejeweled with mosses and flowers. then i pictured our office secretary naked, which really has nothing to do with any beer. like her, tho, this beer has a silky smooth body and light sweetness. and strangely i feel myself wanting more.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

Slight roastiness to flavor, but sweetness in play as well, with mild hops and accompanying tang along for the ride...Carbonation is light, as is the mild finish, which is slightly fruity (the reference to plums is accurate)...The usual Ayinger attention to balance is in full evidence here--all the elements interplay harmoniously...Feels light in the mouth, and really is overall a delicate brew, but with enough substance to satisfy...a great balancing act!

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Uninspiring but ok.
