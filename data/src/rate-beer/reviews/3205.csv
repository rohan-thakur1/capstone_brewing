3205,"2017-02-16",3.9,"12 oz can. It pours a pale golden color with a medium sized long lasting white head. It has the aroma of hay & bread with hints of resin. It has a nice clean pilsner taste with a nice hop bitterness. I taste hay, bread and pine. This is a very good beer. Im glad I bought it.","Dacula, Georgia, USA","DarkSong"
3205,"2016-10-30",1.0,"- bräunliches Bernstein mit fast keiner Schaumbildung
- leichte Aromen nach Trockenfrüchten, Erde, Malz und etwas Honig
- fast keine Carbonisierung
- der Antrunk wirkt durch die minimale Kohlensäurebeigabe leicht schal und 
 abgestanden
- der ganze Verlauf hat eine seltsame Wässrigkeit, welche das Geschmacks-
 erlebnis völlig trübt
- geschmackstechnisch wirkt irgendwie nur das röstige Malz als etwas belebendes Element
Fazit: Schales Gesöff","Bad Bellingen, GERMANY","Blueshawk"

3205,"2016-05-23",3.8,"Pours up a crystal clear deep gold amber color, with a fluffy white head. Aroma is fruity hops with a yeast component. The flavor is malty, but has plenty of fruity hops to balance it out. Clean slightly dry finish. Soft carbonation with smooth medium body. Over all great stuff.","North Carolina, USA","HourGlass13"

3205,"2016-03-05",3.4,"On tap at the brewery in their new Laughing Skull glass.
Pours golden-amber color; clear, with a decent white head. 

Near medium body with crisp carbonation and a dry finish.

Aroma; fruity Calypso hops with some bread.

The flavor follows but is more Hoppy than expected for style; this lives up to the promise of a very flavorful lager.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
