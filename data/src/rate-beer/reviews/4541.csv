4541,"2015-11-18",3.3,"On tap: better than average lager, nicer than mass market beer. Typical Czech beer, for better or worse. I generally prefer ""dvanactku"" (12 degree pivo, this is an 11) but this is eminently drinkable...","","CzechTex"

4541,"2013-03-17",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Toasted cereals and fresh herbal hops  evolve in this tight, soft Svetly.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the shiny golden.
-The hop character is delicate but vibrant; like freshly-chopped herbs.
-Malts also offer biscuity grain angles.
-Very good stuff, but still cannot compete with Uneticky 12 in a tasting.
