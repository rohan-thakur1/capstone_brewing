Poura a completely black color, with nearly no head at all.

Has the most distinctive Bourbon barrel presence, I have yet experienced. Despite the Bourbon dominance, coffee cuts through easily among a huge amount of wood, as well as scorched, earthy malts. Hints of molasses remind me of this being a stout, setting the balance, but nothing more, this beer is focused on its warming coffee Bourbon blend. 

Drinks throughout smooth, perfectly fitting for the full body of the beer to unfold.

Not only becomes the Bourbon recognizable on the palate very early, the oaky barrel quality seemingly stands out on itself, blending perfectly into earthy, pleasantly bitter coffee beans. As on the nose, there is a certain, almost sticky sweetness detectable in the beer, but only as a neccesary counterpart to the fiery Bourbon coffee melange, adding toffee, cocoa nibs and fudge to the blend. Liquor heat gets perfectly wrapped up by the coffee, with a sweeter, slick finish, turning into a chocolate direction at the very end, accompanied by vanilla, booze and earthy ground coffee - revealing throughout a fantastic flavour variety.

Impressive beer, huge, bold, focused, while leaving enough space on the palate to exhibit an intriguing depth. Pretty much focused on coffee and Bourbon, with a mousse au chocolate creamy nouthfeel to it, providing oak, heat, fudge and gourmet coffee.","GERMANY","aleigator"

The pour is a viscous oily black with a dark khaki colored head and a few clingy spots of excellent lace. The aroma is really something else. The bourbon and the vanilla really dominate up front. But the complexity that falls in with the chocolate and the toasted malt and coffee are just incredible. There is a mild pakiness going on with a touch of smoke on the back end. Just everything is hope for. The flavor is really good. There is a beautiful bourbon heat up front and it rolls through a plethora of pleasing flavors. Vanilla and chocolate, roasted coffee and smoked oak. The levels of complexity are great. The mouth feel is a touch thin. I like the soft carbonation and the syrupy clinginess of the beer, but I think the bourbon takes a little away from the thickness of the mouth feel. The aftertaste is incredible.

I just love it when IÂ’m out and about and run in to a bottle by complete accident. This situation surely is one of those. Pours black with a light bubbly tan head. Flavor is cocoa nibs, coffee grounds, bold vanilla and spicy chocolate. Some booze sneaks into the aroma as well, but weÂ’ll expected. DoesnÂ’t ruin things for me. IÂ’ve said it before, but I absolutely love it when a beer lives up to its hype. Flavor seems initially boozy, as it is. However it smooths out very nicely.

1008,"2015-01-30",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2015 Three year old bottle, but with black neckfoil (the print on the bottle says ""with coffee and aged in bourbon barrels"", so I assume it is the same thing). One of the most expensive beers I ever bought, delivered to me by my dear former colleague Maaike. I taste this a little above cellar temperature from an old port wine snifter. Black colour (but in fact an extremely dark ochre brown), thin deep beige head, a little more Â’looseÂ’ than I had expected and breaking open after a short while but retaining well around the edges, with a delicate, silky lacing. The aroma is heavenly: a dense, thick, strong and intoxicating perfume of all the good things you would expect in a big stout, and more. Impressions of freshly roasted coffee beans, kahlua, orange liqueur, warm chocolate sauce, cognac, liquorice, vanilla beans, peat, leather, oaky tannins and even moist wood, gingerbread, hints of soy sauce, cooked meat, cloves and butterscotch. This liquid commands respect, nothing in the nose reveals even the faintest flaw; IÂ’m beginning to understand why this beer scores so high on this site. Taste is... well, intense, to say the least: an overpowering symphony of candied fruits, espresso beans, fondant chocolate, vanilla, oak, candi syrup, dried orange peel... Difficult to point out which comes first. Carbonation is sharpish, even a bit fizzy at first; mouthfeel is thick and smooth, somewhat cloyingly sweet at first but drying more and more towards the end, over a big yet refined, oily, multi-layered maltiness. Spiciness, bitterness and intensity increase in the finish, where a strong bourbon presence takes the lead along with strong woody tannins, with a drying, even somewhat burning effect which can be felt from the tip of the tongue till deep in the throat; peppery hops are quite strong as well, and so is the remaining syrupy maltiness. The bourbon alcohol and the strong, coffeeish roasted bitterness keep struggling for dominance but remain matched. How sweet the onset may have been, the ending of this complex ale is bone dry.  This is a powerful, demanding form of liquid gastronomy in which many things are happening at the same time. Still: this is, contrary to what I had expected, probably not quite the best stout I tasted so far - the alcohol burn is just a little bit too much over the top for me, the mouth and throat keep sticking a bit with the initial candied sugariness and it is, for this particular style, a bit overcarbonated. Nevertheless: hugely complex, hugely enjoyable, very impressive with a formidable balance between sweet and bitter, both present in their most Â’compressedÂ’ and intense form. Something to be reckoned with and enjoyed carefully, concentratedly - and sip by sip. Wow, what an experience... Big cheers to Maaike!","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Smells of very thick molasses, nicely boozy bourbon, thick mocha, chocolate cake, sweet cinnamon, lots of vanilla oak, touch sweet liquorish, nicely full and rich with bourbon, thick syrupy quality with chocolate sauce. Tastes of coffee, lot of vanilla, molasses, very warming, alcohol burn, almost a bit like someone poured a shot of bourbon in here, bitter coffee roast, roast is more presence here than in most beers of this style, alcohol lingers, some bitter herbs, syrup, chicory, lingering bitterness. Quite nice and decadent Bourbon BA RIS, almost too aggressive for its own good, this almost feels like a far better Black Tuesday to me. Nicely aggressive beer to nurse slowly at home. I havenÂ’t been too exited about AleSmith so far but this is right up my alley.

1008,"2014-04-27",4.6,"Bottle thanks to boutip, 2009 vintage. Appearance is a nice full black with decent brown mocha head. Aroma is quite straightforward with bourbon, vanilla, the usual Alesmith divine caramel and molasses. You can definitly feel the high alcohol content which brings the ripe fruits upfront along with bourbon and caramel notes. Flavors are hard to describe as they arenÂ’t amazingly complex but so well integrated and intense. Bourbon and age seem to have completly taken over coffee from the regular version. As much as I like the regular version, BA speedway lifts this one to a new level without being over the top. Exactly what I expect from a bourbon barrel version.

Side-by-side with Black Note with BA speedway being a close winner. Although I prefered Black NoteÂ’s palate and aroma, BA speedwayÂ’s flavors were out of this world. My favorite stout aside from BCS Rare.","Quebec, CANADA","Luk_"

1008,"2013-10-03",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2014 Bottle: Thanks, Kevin! Silky, black body with only some dark brown at the extremities. The tan cap is a shade darker than the original SpeedwayÂ’s and it dissolves a little quicker as well. Powerful aroma with huge barrel qualities; soft oak, vanilla, bourbon - slightly grainy and raw - dark fudge, and a mild hint of coffee. Coffee is quite muzzled here, compare to regular Speedway. Creamy, sexy smooth body with flavors of bourbon and vanilla up front, followed by light coconut, dense fudge, and some dark fruit and anise-like sweetness. The coffee is very understated on the palate as the bourbon character shines through, a bit unrefined. Very good beer, but it may just be a tad over the top. Though this beer is still delicious, it is not an improvement over the base, in my opinion.

S: Bourbon up fron couple with some figs and various dark fruit. Sweet barrel presence with some caraml and light vanilla. A little stone fruit sweetness with some roasted malts and chocolate.

T: The barrel is upfront with some oak and smooth bourbon. Bakers chocolate and some milk chocolate with heavy roast. IÂ’m missing the coffee flavors from this guy, but itÂ’s still really good.

M: Silky smooth mouthfeel, medium to heavy bodied. Medium carbonation level.

A -  Poured a heavy oily black. Very big 3 finger espresso colored head that faded to nearly nothing

S - Nose is as expected. Not as boozy as BCBS but very much big on vanilla, dark chocolate and espresso beans with a hint of campfire. 

T -  Loads of boozy bourbon charred oak alcohol at the front. Middle is dominated by vanilla and toasted walnuts and caramel. Finish is all oak..just smokey and oaky and big. I get a hint of off-flavors like cheap candies and smoke but itÂ’s not too bad.

The beer is silky smooth in the mouth and each time you taste you can focus on a new flavor.

4.5 A: Black color. Two fingers of creamy light brown head. Retention is very good for a brew this big and a sizeable ring of lacing is left.

4.5 S: As expected, there isnÂ’t a whole hell of a lot of coffee left in this. There is some coffee, but it might just be coming from the base stout. Lots of chocolate and molasses. Caramel and a touch of smoke to follow. The bourbon is a bit softer than I was expecting, but IÂ’m not disappointed since the base beer is more than solid. Leathery with melon and apple fruitiness. Light oak and enough vanilla to please.

4.0 T: The taste is very good, but it seems like the bourbon is now carrying the beer instead of the opposite found in the nose. Leather, vanilla, melon, smoke, light spiciness, oak, and bourbony booze predominate. Chocolate, molasses, caramel, and coffee from the stout. DonÂ’t get me wrong, this is borderline 4.5.

4.5 M: Medium, borderline heavy body. Good moderate carbonation. Nice creaminess. No qualms here.

4.5 D: Very tasty beer, but I wish it was easier to get. It takes a lot to pull this in a trade, so in the future IÂ’ll resign myself to obtaining BCSs, CBS, and BA Boris. That said, IÂ’m happy I traded for this because it is a great beer and something everyone should try.

1008,"2012-03-15",3.8,"From notes.  

The full black color, long lasting tan cap, and high viscosity on BA Speedway definitely signals the brewers intention to make a thick, rich, and complex imperial stout.  

For me, there is too much bourbon in the aroma and flavor, stifling one of my favorite base beers.  The bourbon and oak actually dry out the mouthfeel and pull some of the smoothness out of the flavor.  Chocolate, bitter roasted malt, and a little bit of coffee step in behind the bourbon.  It is a little bit acrid at the end of each sip.  As it warms up a little bit, I get some vanilla, oak, and milky sweet notes.  I would suspect that some of the off-putting bitter coffee and malt notes and the acrid mouthfeel come from the old coffee.  Since this was a 2009 bottle, the coffee has significantly faded and could have left behind the old coffee taste that I have observed in a number of aged coffee stouts.  

BA Speedway is still enjoyable nonetheless, but this bottle does not do justice to how delicious fresh Speedway Stout is.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

The taste is really smooth and adds up with the nose. There is the marshmallow character that only comes out in the best of barrel aged beers and the vanilla.

The flavor was deliciously fudgy, nutty with great bourbon influences. Subdued vanilla, caramel and alcohol with a slightly noticeable astringency that I imagine comes from the coffee.

1008,"2012-02-03",5.0,"Old Review from 2010.  Poured from a growler - BA Speedway pours well you guessed it, pitch black.  Not much head is formed.  Small lacing of tan head around the glass.  Now with a lot of barrel aged brews, youÂ’re punched in the nose with whatever barrel the brew was aged in.  In this case itÂ’s bourbon but youÂ’re not really punched in the face by it here.  ItÂ’s definitely there but I feel like this might be the best mixture and balance I have ever seen in a barrel aged brew.  The bourbon didnÂ’t have to fight with the amazing espresso, dark chocolate, vanilla, and molasses.  This is a complex brew but like I said this is the most balanced version of a barrel aged beer I have ever smelled.

Taste is just like the smell.  The bourbon might of been a little more active here but itÂ’s still balanced pretty much perfectly.  The dark chocolate lingers on the palette but then the slighty burnt espresso comes in and washes it away.  The brew ends with vanilla, brown sugar, and some dark fruit.  I just canÂ’t explain how damn nice this beer is.  If I had to drink one beer for the rest of my life this might just be it.

S - Smells of rich coffee, milk chocolate, vanilla, oak, and warm bourbon. For being seven, going on eight, years in the bottle this one has held up beautifully, still plenty of coffee to go around.


T - Starts off with a big dose of fresh brewed coffee slowly giving way to a mix of chocolatey sweetness, vanilla, oak, tobacco, and warm bourbon. Even with all those flavors going on it remains balanced, smooth and easy drinking. Finish has lots of dark roast, lingering on the pallet for some time. A touch of oxidation creeps in as it warms up but it doesnÂ’t really affect the taste at all.


M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Full, smooth, feel with plenty of dark roast, lingering on the pallet for quite awhile after consumption.


O - Damn, this is easily one of the best Barrel Aged stouts I have ever had. The balance of dark flavors from the base beer blend flawlessly with the barrel aging to form one amazing beer. I can not thank to enough Kramer for the chance to try this one.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
1008,"2011-12-30",5.0,"750ml bottle - Herring Creek beer tasting 

ItÂ’s been awhile since I had a beer this stunning. IÂ’ve had the opportunity to have the regular Speedway and itÂ’s always a pleasure to consume, but this is a showcase of what barrel aging can do to an already fantastic beer. 

The beer pours out a basically perfect pour. At least a perfect pour to me. Completely black, dense light brown head, long lasting. An aroma just bursting at the seams with depth and complexity. Notes of bourbob, wood, anise, toffee, brown sugar, roastd malts, Tootsie Rolls, malt balls, milk chocolate, molasses...incredible. 

The flavor profile echoes the aroma, but the intensity of the flavor is unmatched. Alcohol is much more present in the flavor (as expected) than the aroma, but even then it mixes well with the other flavors. Everything is so damned well balaced itÂ’s amazing. Mouthfeel is oily, creamy, dense. The beer just coats and clings to the glass and mouth like no other beer IÂ’ve had before. 

Simply put, this beer has everything that I want and look for in an imperial stout. ItÂ’s created amazingly well, and the time it spent in the bourbon barrel worked incredibly well. I cannot recommend this beer, if you can find it, enough.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

Taste is ultra soft, muted chocolate, lactic fattiness, and zero acidic coffee and lemon character which I despise in the normal Speedway Stout. This right here is a masterpiece. Muted barrel character, no heat, no booze. Just imperial stout perfection right here. Perfect palate: melted chocolate, chocolate pound cake, fatty yogurt, mild bourbon spice, buttery ganache.

1008,"2011-08-13",4.7,"Somehow the people over at Alesmith managed to Barrel age a serious stout without making the aroma massively influenced by the aging inside the barrel. It smells beautifully of Coffee, Chocolate, Malt and at the end, Wood, and itÂ’s wonderfully subtle. The pour was dark like Ink and formed a speckled caramel colored head that was about a half inch thick but revealed no lacing on the glass. Possibly due to a substandard pour by me?

The beer taste was simply awesome. This high level seems consistent with Speedway. Every flavor from the Malt, to the chocolate and coffee are HUGE. ThatÂ’s the amazing thing. There is almost nothing subtle about this beer, and at the same time, the wood and sweet flavors that finish the beer are light and linger on the palate. The beer is complex to be sure, but the flavors arenÂ’t lightly floating around. They smack you in the face and it is better for doing so. Amazing beer.

750 ml bottle generously shared by colonelforbin.  Thanks Mike.  2007 vintage.  Pours black as night with close to no head and no lacing on the glass.  The aroma is tons of dark chocolate, a decent amount of alcohol, some cherry, plum, and a hint of coffee.  The taste has a light sweetness, with some coffee, cherry, plum, The finish has some alcohol and a bit of bitterness on the finish.  Full bodied, but not quite as creamy as regular speedway.  Low carbonation.  A great beer, but quite a different beast than the 2009 BA Speedway (drank side-by-side).  The coffee was faded in this one (unsurprisingly) and it had quite a bit more alcohol present (somewhat surprising).  The cherry and fruit came through a bit more in this vintage.  Not quite as good as the 2009 vintage.
9.5.9.4.18


On tap at the Toronado Stout Festival.  2008 vintage, I believe.  Pours a dark black with a little bit of light coming through at the edges.  A small chocolaty tan head leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass, much like the regular Speedway Stout.  This beer was served relatively cold and at first seemed like another pretty good imperial stout.  The aroma was vanilla, a little dark chocolate, and some bourbon with the taste very similar to the aroma.  Once the beer warmed up some it turned into easily one of the best beers IÂ’ve ever had.  The aroma is dark chocolate, vanilla, cherry, plum and dark fruits, dark roasted coffee, bourbon, and a little alcohol.  The initial taste is sweet with vanilla and cherry and then going into light coffee and dark chocolate.  The finish is a bit of bourbon with vanilla and light alcohol and a very light bitterness.  Not hot at all.  Very smooth beer.  Full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel.  Light carbonation.  If this beer has on flaw, it is that the initial taste is the tiniest bit too sweet.  Very different from the base beer.  Coffee is a background flavor instead of being front and and center.  Tons of different flavors that are all well integrated.  A little less bitterness on the finish than the regular Speedway Stout.  Both are amazing beers.  I would probably give the barrel aged version the slight edge based on its depth and complexity.

Richly earthy with a bit of soft whisky flavour.  The coffee is almost completely gone really.  Chewy and salty.

A: Pours a very dark brown with a powerful mocha head. Very nice lacing as it makes its way down. Great appearance on such a strong brew.

S: Massive bourbon nose in the initial whiff, followed by sweetened dark fruits, roasted malt, and a hint of wood.

T: Big bourbon again. A bit of roasted malt, and a beautiful yet quaint dark, tart cherry flavor. A bit of sweetened dark fruits. Hints of oak and a very nice espresso bitterness. Very complex all around. I love regular Speedway, and this one blows it away.

2007 vintage bottle #212. Poured into a tulip. Beer is black with a thin brown head that breaks and clings to the glass. Some (very little) lacing left on the glass and the carbonation is apparently low.

There is a woody / liquor sweet aroma to this beer. Smells great. Not a lot of alcohol but some sweetness and a hint of roasted malt.

Beer is really really smooth. Medium to full bodied, sweetness up front with an ever so slight amount of heat behind it. Oddly there is almost a late tartness to this beer. Its not lactic or acetic, the beer isnÂ’t going bad but there is a strong almost tannic character to the whole beer. I suppose this the result of the wood aging process. It is unexpected but does not interrupt the flow of the flavors in the mouth. Bitterness at the back is low but good. Overall a really good beer. IÂ’d still like to do the side-by-side with the regular.

A: Dark brown-black body with a slight khaki head. Settled to a spotty skim quickly. Not much in the way of lace.

S: Lovely... Bourbon, oak, vanilla, espresso, caramel, general roasty goodness.

T: The bourbon here is sublime... all the flavor without much of the burn. Earthy oak and vanilla are present along with profound coffee and espresso flavors. Nice caramel underbelly with perhaps a little brown sugar.

M: Moderate-heavy bodied. Oily, smooth and lightly carbonated. Nice finish that lingers for a few seconds without any burning sensation from the bourbon.

O: Truly top notch. I think this vintage is just about at its peak. It was sublimely delicate and complex. Would easily seek out another bottle if anyone is trading!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
1008,"2010-06-30",4.9,"2003 vintage received from seaoflament. Thank you, Carlos! Appearance: From a 750ml bottle into a wine glass, the only suitable thing I had on hand at the place I drank this. The pour is dark chocolate brown, nearly black, with no head whatsoever. It sits in the glass viscous and opaque. Smell: Chocolate and molasses. Moderate oxidation, but the good variety - there are no off aromas here. Rather, itÂ’s got a quality almost like vintage port or sherry. Wonderfully rich, sweet and dessert like. Taste & mouthfeel: The first thing noticed is that thereÂ’s no carbonation. The second thing noticed is that carbonation is completely unnecessary. The lack of bubbles only enhances the chocolatey richness and silky smooth mouthfeel. As the nose suggests, molasses is up front in the taste, with a strong undercurrent of chocolate and dark fruit. Coffee still comes through with surprising strength, especially in the finish, which dries the palate only slightly. Compared to fresh Speedway, all the rough edges have been smoothed; thereÂ’s no trace of alcohol, low bitterness, no astringency; this is remarkably smooth beer. If not for the rarity (and strength), this would be downright quaffable. Notes: This is the sort of beer that, before you try it, you have to wonder if itÂ’s all hype or if it actually merits all the praise. The answer is yes, itÂ’s worth every word of praise. Incredible stuff.","California, USA","largadeer"

The bourbon is very present with bok oaky notes as well. Some roasted malts, coffee and citrus hops. Medium-full bodied, smooth and very complex. Well balanced. Very nice beer.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"

Pours a deep, dark black with a slight tan head. Smells roasty, toasy, and coffee with a subtle sweetness in the nose, along with the barrel. Sweet up front with an aggressive bitterness in the back end just like the regular version. For some reason this is just not as good as I expected or wanted it to be.

1008,"2010-05-26",4.4,"2006 Vintage 750ml gold foil / standard label (so its from the second release of the 2006 vintage) poured into a snifter.

Appearance: Inky black goodness with a tiny brown cream head that shows little retention but leaves some swirls of lace behind.

Smell: Loads of beautiful bourbon sweetness meets oak, vanilla and roast malt. Smells more sweet than boozy. Pungent but well refined. IÂ’m not getting as much coffee as other reviewers have mentioned.

Taste: My first sip provides an initial wave of sweet oak that opens up into dark roasted malt, a touch of dark fruits...plum and prune mainly and finishes with a refined bourbon twang.

Mouthfeel: Fairly creamy and on the thick side of medium bodied. Not too much carbonation but this brew doesnÂ’t need it.

Drinkability: For a 12% abv brew IÂ’m finding little heat, little booze, a good mouthfeel, and a good flavor profile.

2007 vintage. Bottle number 205 of 447. This was sampled side-by-side with a regular Speedway Stout. The beer pours dark brown to black with a brown head. The aroma is bourbon, oak, vanilla, roasted malt, chocolate and alcohol. The flavor is awesome. I get bourbon, oak, semi-sweet chocolate, brown sugar and vanilla. The oak and tannic notes are very tart or bitter, giving the beer an almost sour quality. The coffee has completely faded. Medium-thick mouthfeel and low-medium carbonation.

The dominant coffee nose of reg. is combined with strong vanilla-bourbon elements, light milk chocolate, and twangs of oak and alcohol. The flavor is similar, huge and voluptious but very well balanced by a full-on chocolate assault that follows through the finish. The bourbon level would probably be overkill in a smaller imperial stout, but the profile and body hold. Despite the barrel showing a slight edge, this is very drinkable, and though not of mind-blowing complexity, quite enjoyable.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
1008,"2010-04-29",4.9,"HUGE thanks to Kevin for sharing this growler with us!

A-Body is big, thick and opaque black. Pours with a 1-2 finger creamy dark tan head. Head fades eventually to a thick collar but plenty of lacing sticks all the way down the glass.

S- Exceptional. A delicate balance between bourbon BA characteristics and IRS characteristics. Very complex and slightly sweet-of moderate strength. Vanilla, oak, a slight hint of bourbon sweetness, dark chocolate, anise, dark fruit. Just wonderful.

T-Flavor is just as good as the nose but adds a slight roasted malt component to it. Upfront is a lot of IRS characteristics-dark fruit, anise, licorice, dark chocolate-and offers a bit of vanilla and bourbon sweetness and the slightest hint of oak in the background. A hint of roasted malt comes through for the finish to create an equal balance to the slightly sweet initial flavor. Some remnants of the initial flavor linger as well as a slight roasted malt bitterness.

P- Low to medium carbonation and a body that is thick, viscous, and exceptionally smooth and creamy.

O- This is one of the best stouts I have ever had. The BA components compliment the stout characteristics very well and this is worlds better than regular speedway-seem like 2 completely different beers. The flavors are really big here but it is not nearly as aggressive as regular speedway. Great to try the 2 side by side!

Vanilla and bourbon from the oak smooth things out and add even more depth to the flavor. The bourbon presence is almost perfect without any added alcohol heat.

Tasted almost like a mocha with a few shots of bourbon in it.  This was incredible oak/rye/molasses flavor in a beer WITHOUT the kick in the back of the throat.

Courtesy of jdubFL.  Pours super deep darkness with thin tan head. The aroma is full force bourbon, musty aged oak and rich dark fruitiness from raisins, prunes and cherries followed by yummy chocolate and a sense of dark roasted coffee. The taste brings up a pleasing mix of chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts, sweet dark fruitiness and oak. Wow! Smooth rich tasty goodness offering up velvetiness into the finish with chocolate, coffee, oak and smooth slick sweet bourbon. Love this.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
1008,"2010-03-26",4.5,"What great luck!  I was at the brewery and they had this on tap and actually got a growler fill ($30).  Pours completely black with nice mocha colored head.  Aroma of bourbon, earthy organic coffee, and burnt dark chocolate.  Flavor is hot bourbon which somehow blends into the rich coffee tones very well.  Also notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, and ash.  Complex and rich like a bourbon-drizzled brownie drunk with really great espresso.  The high ABV is much more noticeable than the regular Speedway with quite a bit of booze in the finish, but this is not overly distracting.  I had sampled this previously from a bottle and thought that it was much too hot (booze) and that it drowned out the wonderful smooth coffee tones which is what I love about the regular Speedway Stout.  But trying it from the growler, I have more appreciation for this barrel-aged take on a truly classic and world-class beer.  (386, 259)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"
1008,"2010-03-16",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2010 (Bottle, thanks to Westside Threat) Pours near black with a small brown head. The aroma is round and quite dry with a mild chocolate and coffee roast alongside typical vanilla, coconut, mint and light dill-like oak notes. The malt also brings tones of dark bread.  Lots of toffee. The dry/roasted profile plays extremely well with the round and light sweet oak. Light alcohol warmth present. The flavour holds a dry malt profile but the oak brigs some sweetness. Perfect, well-integrated bitterness alongside a tiny, tiny acidic whisper. Coffee beans and chocolate/black malt in perfect harmony. Vanilla, coconut and wood from the oak. Toffee and light hints of dried fruits. Maybe some blackberries. The mouthfeel is round, fat and soft with light carbonation. Roast, alcohol, mint and some earthy, light resinous hops on the finish. Full bodied. I was rather sceptical towards this beer - I am not a super fan of the regular Speedway Stout (donÂ’t get me wrong itÂ’s a good beer) and some of the other barrel aged beers from Ale Smith have been too oak-driven, but this is fantastic!","GÃ¶teborg, SWEDEN","Marsiblursi"

Lovely viscosity of the base beer is immediately evident in the handsomely sludgy pour. Coffee has certainly abated in the nose somewhat but thereÂ’s a rich chocolate core that holds together the fairly subtle barrel flavors and the more harsh qualities of the roasted malts, etc. One of the best American imperials actually benefits from barrel-aging, very, very nice.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Speedway Stout is so awesome on its own that I couldnÂ’t even imagine what would happen when they aged it in the -bals. The answer is that it became a ridiculously good beer, even among ridiculously good beers.  Pours a clear light golden color...no, scratch that, actually itÂ’s pitch black. This is where photons go to die. Not much in the way of head, but then again it did come out of a growler. This is the beerÂ’s only minor flaw, if it even is one.  Absolutely heavenly. High-quality chocolate and coffee (IÂ’m talking weasel crap quality), roastiness, oak, and just a touch of bourbon.  Amazingly balanced, yet very intense awesomeness liquified. Lots of chocolate and vanilla, a little bourbon, sweet caramel malt, roasted malt, and oak. Coffee is definitely less dominant than in regular Speedway, as I hear aging will do to coffee flavor. This is a good thing, even though I like a strong coffee presence in a stout. When I drank this, I think a light might have shone down from the heavens and angels might have sang, but IÂ’m not 100% sure.  Incredibly smooth, full, and creamy on the palate. Very soft carbonation.  I know this is a barrel aged imperial stout, but I could drink it ALL NIGHT LONG!

Lightly boozy bourbon notes, huge coffee, and a touch of vanilla.  Flavor is full of roast and coffee, along with some slightly oxidized plum tones.  Finishes up with a nice roast fueled bitterness.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

1008,"2009-08-06",2.7,"2006 vintage that may have lay a bit too long.  Watery Bourbon flavor, not much of the original speedway goodness.  Something lost in translation.  Pour is flat (and I graded it on a curve anyway considering the barrel aging).  Smell is a bit better with some chocolate sneaking around the bourbon.  Flavor is where it falls apart.  Palate is doable, but the overall impression isnÂ’t helped by the fact that this was probably second only to the Westy 12 in my expectations.","Donora, Pennsylvania, USA","Sonicdescent"

The nose on this was amazing, fresh brownies, burnt sugar, molassas, touch of dry coffee.  Cold to very warm the profile changed which just added to the experience.  This could last another 5 years.  Looks like almost no carbonation, but when it hits the palate is sparkles.  Super smooth and subtle.  Booze hits you but later on...  Finish is good, malty, but not super long.

1008,"2009-06-27",4.6,"2006 edition.  Bottle 120/235.  I finally decided to bust one of these out tonight after patiently aging since last spring.  I figure celebrating my last weekend before starting residency is a big enough occasion.  Pours a thick and black with no head.  It doesnÂ’t coat the glass like some IS.  Aroma is strong bourbon at first with coffee, vanilla, oak, chocolate, and dark fruit.  It smells like some kind of rich dessert.  Flavor is dark chocolate and coffee with a nice compliment of bourbon and oak that is a big player but not overpowering.  Sweet dark fruits as well.  It finishes with a little alcohol warmth, which is actually pleasant and doesnÂ’t reflect the 12%.  The mouthfeel is not quite as thick as I expected and very smooth.  So glad I was in the right place at the right time to be able to get ahold of this.  Amazing beer.  I heart Alesmith.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","coharahawk"
1008,"2009-06-19",4.1,"2006 Vintage. Pours an oily black with no apparent carbonation. Fully opaque. A little swirling the snifter kicks up a few bubbles, then goes back to still blackness. Aroma is sweet, and quite fruity; Dark fruits, that is. Just a little coffee on the nose, with cherry and plum/prune. Just a little wood and bourbon aroma. The flavor is pretty huge on this one, way bigger and more complex than the regular Speedway. Very tarry, lots of cigar smoke, leather, booze is alive and present. Huge espresso is present, with dark chocolate. Sweet, but not an all-out sugar assault. Again, there is dark, smoky tar throughout. Extremely chewy. Only faintly bitter. If you swish it around in your mouth, you get some more carbonation, as you can almost feel the cavities developing in your teeth. IÂ’m glad I got to try this. Definitely not a session beer (Of course if youÂ’re reading this, you likely already knew that. I mean, like anybody other than the CEO of Alesmith would have the means to session this anyway.), but very soulful for just a glass now and then. Overall, excellent.","California, USA","Gypsy19"
1008,"2009-06-14",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 5, 2009 Original:
Bottle 191 of 447 from Hophead22 beer tasting. Not very aromatic. Had a very sour after taste. Something happened to this bottle unfortunately. Maybe it sat in a hot car or garage for too long. I was very disappointed. Looking forward to trying the new batch and will re-rate this.

Update:
On draft at Pizza Port Strong Ale Festival 2009.  Dark black pour with toasty brown head that spilled all over my rating book (oops). Aroma was hints of coffee, whiskey, dark fruits, and cocoa. Taste was just bourbon and chocolate. Pallet was medium and nice. Overall very good stuff but the barrel over powers the roastiness and the coffee that makes speedway what it is.","Lake Arrowhead, California, USA","JoeTheYounger"
1008,"2009-06-08",3.6,"IÂ’m really thinking that AlesmithÂ’s barrell aging program just isnÂ’t for me.  Anyway, the aroma here was pretty subtle with nuts, pecans, wood and dark chocolate.  Tastes of dark chocolate, coffee (not too much), wood, and is more acidic or astringent than I anticipated.  Finishes all wood and astringency.  Full bodied to be sure, but plenty easy to drink.  Regular Speedway is the better beer.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"
1008,"2009-06-03",4.0,"In short: An bourbon aged coffee stout that spent too much time in the bourbon barrel.  Excellent but I prefer the regular Speedway.
How: Bottle 750ml.  Sent to me by many people (doubleO, hophead84, kegbear, moreÂ…).  This rating for a 2007 vintage (from kegbear I think).
The look: Black body topped by a short lived small tan head
In long: Drank a full bottle next to on of the regular Speedway that WeeHeavySD brought to me over a year ago.  So both beer are about the same age.  No need to describe the BA beer, better to describe the difference between the regular Speedway that we all know and love.  The nose of the BA has moderate bourbon, some vanilla and very little coffee.  Overall the nose is a lot less roasted and less coffee than the regular Speedway.  The taste is overloaded with vanilla (that the regular Speedway doesnÂ’t have), light roasted level (less than regular Speedway), quite a bit of black liquorice (a lot more than in the regular Speedway), some bourbon (less than I expected), some port-wine (something the regular speedway didnÂ’t have).  The carbonation is softer than in the regular Speedway.  The alcohol is a little apparent (more apparent than in the regular Speedway).  Overall the bourbon barrel aging is so over-done that the beer barely feels like a coffee stout.  Barely any coffee notes.  IÂ’ve had chocolate stouts that had more coffee flavours than this one.  This really is a very good brew, going through a 750ml by myself was a pleasure, something I cannot say about most of 12%+ beers.  However I cannot believe that some people can genuinely find the BA better than the regular Speedway.  Hey, I just had this great idea, why not use Bourbon Barrels to make scotch!!!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1008,"2009-05-28",4.6,"Bottle 53/233 from 2006.  Pours an elegent thick dark brown/black with a wisp of brown head.  Aroma is dried red fruit, sweet cafe mocha, and a hint of spicy hops.  The flavour is very refined with vanilla, sweet milk chocolate, cafÃ© au lait, dried cherries, and a slightly bitter finish.  Alcohol is clearly present - like the pleasant warmth from a fine aged rum.  A very fresh, lively stout that I am glad I had the chance to sample.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","DMRz"

Got to re-sample  the Â’03 at the OTM 1st Anniversary AleSmith tasting (4/27/11). The beer is still beautiful. The flavors and aromas are on the down slope but still has a lot of great things.

Its a 2006 BA speedway.

A - Pours a nice deeply black with little light penetrating the thickness of it.

S- It has some bourbon on the front end with big dark fruit prunes especially.

T - Once the bourbon clears you get coffee then chocolate with a very smooth silky finish.

Drinkability is very easy on this. The other guys were saying they may still prefer the regular speedway over the BA version. I like both versions and would but this everyday if it were available to me.

The oak is very apparent in the aroma with a distinct wood flavor that trumps all of the vanilla in the original. Still getting some roasted coffee though. The flavor is still creamy and full of chocolate, cocoa, and coffee.  It is enhanced a bit by the aging with a tinge of nutty woody flavor.

Appearance: Pours a turbid, dark brown, near black body with a thin, short-lived, tan head.

Smell: A very full, all-encompassing bourbon barrel presence on the nose -- large notes of oak wood and full-on bourbon with lighter notes of vanilla and coconut shavings. Pair this up with a malt aroma replete with plenty of chocolate and roast and you have something worth smelling.

Taste: Cup of Sumatra Dark Roast Â’Black SatinÂ’ Coffee stirred up with aged oak and light touches of vanilla and coconut and garnished with a few chocolate-covered coffee beans.

Better than your average BA Impy... but the alcohol is rather distracting on the tongue throughout. Silky on the tongue with a shorter, boozy finish.

1008,"2009-03-22",3.7,"Rustic, reddish black.  Honeycrisp apples, raspberries, and bitter chocolate aroma.  Dark chocolate caramels.  Cherry-cognac chocolates.  Really sweet.  Firmly alcoholic.  

A thick, prickly, spirited flavor.  Lots of bitterness and peppery alcohol, skimming the deep chocolate and creamy sweet flavors with rough strokes.  Sharply warm and borderline hot for me, in amaretto and even kahlua flavors.  The combination of the acrid, oxygenated coffee flavors with the spirit flavors is pretty unpleasant to me, but thankfully it sits deeply enough underneath the ocean of chocolate and molasses and extraneous sweetness that it doesnÂ’t ruin the beer.

Palate is full and oily; certainly hot in the finish, with a peppery singe.  And a little bit of chocolate covered coffee beans lingers long after the finish.  ThereÂ’s a lot of positive qualities here but I canÂ’t appreciate the expired coffee flavors or the heavy heat.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

This looks identical to the regular speedway so IÂ’ll spare the details. The smell was dope, like regular speedway but better, my friend siad it was like candy. The flavors were also very close to the regular speedway, dark coffee bitterness. There was a little bit of a booze but it was quite subtle. This was a very solid stout but honestly I canÂ’t say it is an improvement over the regular speedway.Damn you Alesmith! The four people who drank this agreed that it was not something you would want a whole bottle of. My verdict is that this is good but donÂ’t trade your cellar away for one.

Pours black but not completely opaque as hints of mahogany show through the edges.  The head is one-finger tall, very bubbly and remains a swirl of small bubbles and a ring for the duration, leaving traces of lacing.

The aroma is exceptional.  The bourbon is present up front but is supported by dark roasted malts, bakers chocolate and a whiff of coffee (not nearly as dominant as in the regular version).  The barrel presence is evident with a bit of vanilla.  All of these things seem to come together into one cohesive aroma.

The taste has the sweetness of the chocolate and some dark fruits up front before the dark malts and roasted coffee step up in the middle.  The finish is big on vanilla and bourbon and leaves an alcohol warming as it goes down.

The mouthfeel is very smooth and medium bodied for the style with less carbonation than I remember in the regular version.

This is a fantastic beer though I dont think it quite measures up to the regular version to me.  Either way, its not to be missed.  Thanks again to Derek for his (continued) generosity!","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Notes of sweet, dark chocolate fudge, roasty Cuban coffee, caramelo, and stewed dark fruits are all infused with a subtle, sour mash bourbon twang.  Flavors show perhaps even more depth, as the dark fruity notes begin to better define themselves.  Sweet raison and fig join the fudgy-caramel party, while toasty, vanilla laden oak imparts a smoothing effect.

Deep black with just little shiny brown edges, modest layer of burnt tan fine bubbles. Bright fumey vanilla aroma, brown sugar, a fresh green oakiness. A little briney touch.

Flavor conveys much the same but with the addition of more well-balanced sweetness and alcohol and a smooth smokiness and penetrating bitterness.  Posesses a perfect body that disguises the 12% alcohol while conveying the huge intensity of this beer across its immense, packed flavor profile.

06 - shared by fiver29, Cleveland tasting.  Pours inky black with a small brown head.   Aroma is bourbon, chocolate, coffee, char.

03:  Pours pitch black with no head or carbonation.  Has a nice aroma of vanilla, roasted chocolate malt, and coffee.  Has a medium mouthfeel.  Taste is bourbon, malt, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and it all melds together in a nice smooth chocolate bourbon finish.  Overall  a world class brew.

04:  Everything above, but with carbonation and a thin tan head.  This made my experience a little better with this brew.

06:  Everything above and has more alcohol aroma and flavor to it.

Overall, all three beers taste exactly the same.  The only difference in my mind is that the 03 had no carbonation, the 04 was carbonated, and the 06 had more alcohol in the aroma and taste with even more carbonation.  The lesson here is donâ€™t let these go too long or you wonâ€™t be drinking a carbonated world class brew versus a flat one.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"

1008,"2008-06-10",3.2,"Vintage 2006, bottle 70/235; Sampled June 2008
A fairly vigorous pour produces a one-finger thick, darkly browned, tan colored head in my 25cl tulip glass.  The beer is simply black as it sits in my glass and no amount of putting up to the light makes it anything but opaque.  The aroma has a tartness to it that is strongly influenced by Bourbon-like notes and likely coffee.  Roast coffee notes actually play a big role and mix with some fruity, burnt prune notes and lots of deeply toasted malt notes.  There is also a nice aroma of richly toasted coconut that still has a touch of sweetness of coconut meat.  It also seems to get just a touch musty at times, which mixes in with a lightly spicy oak character and a touch of estery alcohol aromas.

Thick and rich feeling as it firsts hits my tongue, creamy dark malt notes hint at lots of residual sugars, but donÂ’t really contribute much sweetness to this beer.  A very light carbonation also contributes to the creamy feeling of this brew.  Towards the finish the beer thins out considerably while picking up acrid roast notes and sharp, burnt acid quality and a huge bitterness that seems just as much from burnt malt and roast coffee influenced as from the hops.  The dual roast influences of coffee and malt actually contribute a tartness that is noticeable throughout the flavor profile, not just the finish, but it is tempered a bit up front by the unctuous body.

As the beer warms up a bit it begins to lose a touch of the acrid character, but seems to pick up a bit more alcoholic heat.  This last seems to accent a note reminiscent of burnt prunes.  While rich and malty this is surprisingly dry tasting; the thick residual sugars seems to be so well balanced by the roast and barrel flavors that they are not really noticeable.  At most there is a noticeable chocolate / cocoa note here, but even this is pretty devoid of sweetness.  There is also a touch of almost salty, sort of peat like smokiness that is likely a combination of roast malt and barrel influences.  By my second pour the salty, peat-smoke like qualities of this brew are accented even a bit more.  This last, in combination with the rich, dark malt flavors really save this beer for me; though it still has an overwhelming bitter and acrid finish at times.

I do like that the barrel influence does not absolutely overwhelm this beer.  I am not sure if this is still too young or what, but the roasted grain notes really get overly acrid and bitter in the finish.  The barrel influence also contributes to an overall impression of this being unbalanced.  This is not nearly as unbalanced or undrinkable as the BA Old Numbskull though, and is even enjoyable in its own right.  I think that the complexity of the aged, base beer and the lightish influence of the barrel make this at the very least worth procuring for me.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Right off the bat I get an upfront dose of sour in the aroma.  Soon after a wave of bourbon and oak sweep through.  I feel aweful before I even take the first sip.  Soon after I imbibe, my fears are confirmed: this is far past its prime.  There is still remnants of what used to be: wonderful richness of the base beer, beautiful example of barrel-aging, great complexity hidden underneath.  Unfortunately, all of that is dominated by the degregation of time.  A dominant sour character has taken over and thinned its body.  ItÂ’s aggressive nature overshadows what a magnificient beer this must have once been.

To thick for me, and I would like a bit of carbonation but every Speedway IÂ’ve had, BA, aged, or fresh, was still.  Surely my palate is not up to the task of this complex roast bomb, itÂ’s me not you.","Santee, California, USA","stubby"
1008,"2008-04-17",4.4,"2006 vintage, from the brewery. Sampled along side a regular 2007 Speedway Stout. This made for an interesting tasting experience after trying it first with jarspag a few days earlier. ItÂ’s been a long time coming for this rarity. The pour is velvety black, and nearly still. Faint wisps of carbonation swirl on the surface, with some light reaching through the deep maroon edges. Awesome aroma of intense chocolate and bourbon oak, with a big molasses and licorice presence mixed in. The aroma is much more mature and mellowed compared to the regular Speedway (which is comprised more so of fresh coffee and oats), but I canÂ’t say itÂ’s that much better. The flavors here are less of the major coffee presence, and more of a cellared, charred wood tone from the bourbon barrel. While the barrel is not as prominent as BA Wee Heavy or Numbskull, it does add a unique and intriguing layer of complexity to that which is Speedway. Pretty outstanding mouth-feel, just a lot different than normal; oily and coating the palate, minus the carbonation. A tad of a sour, oxidized tang in the finish, but it didnÂ’t downgrade the overall experience that much. 
Overall, yes I think that fresh (and aged) original Speedway does dominate the Imperial Stout style; this blew me away, but not as much as AlesmithÂ’s other barrel-aged beers. Hats off on this creation however, I enjoyed it thoroughly.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"
1008,"2008-04-16",4.1,"Two different 2006 vintages sampled on 4/12/08 & 4/15/08.  Props to Justin to cracking this during 4/12 tasting.  Sampled side by side normal Speedway.  Been waiting a long, long time to try this.... 

Rich, robust and intriguing aromas of dark fruits, sweet sticky bourbon, dark chocolate, warmth, oak.  Flavor becomes increasingly bourbon/caramel SWEET.  I mean really sticky sweet...there is a big presence of dark fruits and licorice behind the sweet malts and dark chocolate.  The roasty, long bitter coffee presense is completely consumed.  In comparison to the full bodied, amazing palate on the normal Speed - this mouthfeel just doesnÂ’t stand up.  As much as I wanted to love this beer, I canÂ’t help but give all the praise back to the original masterpiece.  This didnÂ’t seem to take on the same barrel presence as their other BAÂ’s - it was missing that elegant, velvety, ""WOW"" characteristic in the palate that I found in a beers like BA numbskull/decadence.  IÂ’m afraid this might be a touch hyped.  Hopefully some age will put the cloying characteristics in check.  DonÂ’t get me wrong, this is still an amazing beer - but for now, I like Speedway minus the barrel, who would have thought!!!","San Francisco, California, USA","jarspag"

The last bottle (from a sharing BAer at Maproom) had crazy writing all over the bottle, signitures or something.  I just donÂ’t find this as satisfying as the normal Speedway Stout. Again, I thought that too much bourbon was left behind in the barrel, thinning out the stout and pushing too harsh a bourbon flavor upfront.   The SpeedwayÂ’s complexity fights itÂ’s way through, wonderful coffee roastiness and touches of anice in the finish.

Also had it at BCTC Â’06, courtesy of EgajdzisDaSilky1 traded me the first bottle of this I had, but it was opened at the PP 12 hour fest, so Chris gave me this in replacement, what a guy!Perfect appearance, as youÂ’ve come to expect from AleSmith.  Bottle conditioned carbonation produces a large tan head that is very well-retained and laces quite well.  Dark, dark brown-black body has a medium clarity.STRONG stuff, just like Speedway, of course, with coffee and vanilla beans in the nose, plentiful vinousness (very important) and dry roastiness on the finish.  No tacky caramel and chocolate sweetness and nicely attenuated, as is the regular beer.  Bourbon is very, very reserved in the nose, and only moderate wood dryness reaches the nose, on the finish, adding continued dryness.  Alcohol is lightly perceptible after warming, and adds more intimidating strength.Spanish coffee and dry chocolate open up the flavor, with soft vanilla and light, dry toffee notes through the middle.  Lots of wood, but itÂ’s not overly harsh and is offset by a very unfiltered, well-malted texture.  Coffee is dry and extremely tastefully added, lending a beany-like hardness that combines with some vinousness to provide that wonderful complexity in the base beer.  Very low bourbon character, one of the few Imperial Stouts to actually remain balanced in the bourbon department.  Dry wood, cocoa and some light fusels on the finish.  Love the attenuation level on this stuff.  Tightly carbonated as well, giving a very strong, nearly creamy texture.I love regular Speedway, and the bourbon being correctly done is just the icing on the cake.

AleSmith Barrel Aged Speedway Stout is black and opaque in the glass.  It has a dense brown head.  The aroma is saturated with both vanilla and chocolate and then accented with some hints of bourbon and coffee.  If the aroma isnÂ’t enough to make your mouth water, then the rich, robust, and complex flavor will!  An exquisite and carefully balanced composition of milk chocolate, coffee, bourbon, oak/wood, roasted malt, and some deep fruit flavors all work in harmony to please the senses.  The finish has flavors of coffee and mocha.  BA Speeway has a rich and full body with a silky smoth and creamy texture.  I think it might be just a tiny bit less heavy/smooth/creamy than the regular Speedway Stout though.  Overall, this is a near perfect example of a barrel-aged beer (and Imperial Stout in general!).  This beer lives up to the hype and exceeds my expectations.  Hopefully I will be fortunate enough to somehow experience this beer again sometime in the future.  I can only dream...","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

1008,"2007-03-10",4.5,"Bottle #84 sampled with the fine gentlemen at the Knoxville Spring(ish) tasting, courtesy of Springslicker in one of the most selfless, altruistic examples of generosity. Pours black with a low, brownish head and slick lacing. Some ruby hues are noted in the light. The nose is rich of thick espresso and rich bourbon. A war ensues on my olfactory sense between a mound of rich, dark roasted coffee beans and smooth, aged Kentucky sippinÂ’ whisky with some fainter notes of chocolate and toast in the mix. Take a sip. . .damn. The first sip brings a rich hearty espresso presence into my mouth with earth, mocha, espresso, and vanilla. A few sips later, I start to notice some more vinous, almost sake-like flavors coming out along with nuts, oats, vanilla wafers, madelines. This is dense, deep, and ridiculously good. This is still completely solid and sharp with very defined flavors even three years later. Here is a true complement: this is slightly better than the regular Speedway Stout.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Coffee notes are burnt with black patent flavors and a touch of soy. A surprising note of pineyness also. Finish is medium sweet, chocolatey, roasty and lightly bourbony.

Bold vinous aromas meld quite well with choco-coffee and bourbon, some new oak, chocolate malts, lighter toffee and smores. Flavor is just what I expected though a little less aggressive than IÂ’d hoped for: coffee, chocolate, molasses, burgundy wine notes. The bourbon taste is mild, but comes on strong over the fifty degree mark. Palate is very sticky, in my mouth and on my lips, though in this case as well, not as sappy as the regular version.. Also a little more oily throughout. Very full bodied, long finish that is semi-dry. Good overall, I totally enjoy the regular Speedway more and think it is best left alone. As far as barrel aged stouts go, it is pretty delicious. IÂ’m glad I wasnÂ’t awed, as obtaining the regularly produced Speedway seems to be a tad bit easier.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

1008,"2007-01-04",4.2,"157/228 2004 courtesy of kmcnair from that other site. The aroma is muted chocolate, light oak and roasted malt and while it smells good it doesnÂ’t really wow you either.

The curious thing about this head is that unlike many BA beers you can always tease this one right back up to impressive stature. 
<P>
The fore is hot with spicy oak notes, black chocolate, burnt malt, espresso, some light bourbon and oddly some fairly nutty notes. The coffee seems much less concentrated than in the regular version. The mouthfeel actually has held up quite well and this is a world class beer, but sadly it isnÂ’t quite the wonder beer I have dreamed for over two years. Perhaps that is my fault, but while itÂ’s great itÂ’s not the beer I hyped it up to be in my mind. Which still leaves a wonderful brew.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

1008,"2006-12-28",4.2,"I like but donÂ’t rant and rave about the barrell aged trend. I also love Speedway, so itÂ’s hard to tweek w/ something thatÂ’s already that good (kinda like those folks that remake Beatles tunes, just donÂ’t do it, leave Â’em aloneÂ…. Well, maybe not that extreme, cuz this was darned nice, but..... the straight up Speedway is beautiful, this was just really really nice.) The appearance was pitch black, very thin late developing head (like a dry stout on v. weak nitro), which disappeared as fast as it appeared, although it still provided light lacing somehow. The aroma was oak, coffee, bourbon, raisins. With increasing temperatures, the aroma released some burnt notes along with some true oak. The flavor was raisins, coffee (I wanted more, like the non-aged Speedway), raisins, some bourbon (definitely not overdone, but while it didnÂ’t end up so, it could have used a touch more), light oak, light burnt flavors, chocolate came about with increasing temperatures. The most impressive part may have been the hop hold up, this thing finished with a touch of pine hops, not bad for something 2 years old and barrel aged. Mouthfeel still retained some carbonation, far from a flat beer, and this was comparable in overall mouthfeel to the straight Speedway, perhaps a touch more sticky. A great big huge thanks to my good and very fun beer friend, Bert, who insisted he was holding this for me one day.

Huge aroma of semi-sweet choclate, also features some lighter notes of bourbon, dark toffee and alcohol, with touches of cellar must, faint plum and black cherry.  Very rich and full.  Solid, opaque black color, my glass was poured with no head formation to speak of at all.  Flavor profile is also sweet and chocolatey, full of roasty, toffeeish malt flavor, the middle seeing some dry, dark grainy bitterness coming through and finishing with the coffee flavors coming to the fore at last.  Some lingering esters in the background here as well.  Palate is very smooth and lacking almost fully in noticeable effervescence, which I did miss a little.  Finish is incredibly long and lingering.  Body is full as can be.  Some alcohol burn to note here, but is slighter in overall effect than I had expected.

Aroma is loaded with major bourbon and wood.  The wood really stands out. Chocolate and dark roasted coffee. The coffee aroma takes a while to kick in, once it had been in my glass for 10 minutes it was more noticeable.   There is also a strong whiff of alcohol in the vanilla-like wood.  Flavors smack the lips with wood and buttery bourbon then it changes to an over-roasted coffee flavor mid palate and then to a chocolate, vanilla in the fairly astringant wood and bourbon finish.  Slightly harsher than a well aged Speedway.  Color is dark black with a nice brown head.  Medium-full body with a fairly dry mouthfeel.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"

1008,"2006-08-14",4.7,"Opaque, deep and chocolatey black in color with grey dust in a swirl winding around at the surface to form a reserved head.  Aroma imparts wafts of decadent chocolate truffles infused with a caramel bourbon tract, providing a baseline sweetening, but not over-the-top and independent - decadent, rather.  Glazed caramel chews with hints of frangelico, sweetened with brown sugar and melting chocolate shells.  ItÂ’s a thinker aroma, surrounded by a huge caramel avec bourbon compliment.  Balance is the aromatic key here.  Refined is another way to put it.  
The notion of control is also well fed in the flavor.  Delicate, boisterous chocolates melt like truffles over hot springs.  The roasty espresso bean complexity is muted, capped and trapped under an engulfing dark chocolate coating.  Warming vocal box voices joyous sentiments before the mind comprehends its speech patterns.  Mocha grinds are pressed upon bakers chocolate bricks but the coffee elements are very subdued, hiding the boisterous elements of the regular Speedway with rounded corners, like melting milk chocolate Godiva squares infused with creme de cacao and smooth Magellan.  Oily, full-fledged, big-bodied beer and an overall palate treat.  Smooth, melting, delicatessen chocolate finish is free from bitter coffee arraignments, instead imparting mild tannic lingerings, and succumbing to the smooth chocolate force.

The aroma has notes of bourbon, vanilla, wood, plum, prune, smoke, coffee, and some mocha. The taste has a pop of coffee bitterness, burnt smoky malt and alcohol that attacks the palate before a richer and softer chocolate and vanilla character smooths you over. The back end is earthy and lingers some ripened fruit before the long espresso finish. The mouth feel is oily, sticky and lush. While this is very very good, some may be in shock but I would rather have a regular nicely-aged Speedway over this. The BA version seemed to be TOO BALANCED with the coffee too muted, I am not joking.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

A ton of coffee.  A ton of chocolate.  Whiskey.  Perfect coffee and whiskey, dark chocolate, and other sub-components in the flavor.  MUCH more balanced than the regular.

1008,"2006-08-12",4.4,"Pre-Great Taste sampling at 1FastStiÂ’s house

The capstone of the night, this was the whole reason we were doing a tasting.
   BlakeÂ’s bottle was #13 of 240.  IÂ’ll have to open my bottle of regular
   Speedway to compare, but this was definitely a well crafted well though out
   beer that belongs in the Top 10.  If you ever get the chance to try it savor
   every last drop.
Aroma / Appearance - Oak, vanilla, coffee, black cherry, graham
   crackers and toasted marshmellows dominate a complex and rich nose.  With a
   larger sample I might have picked up even more.  The bourbon notes are evident
   but they do not take over.  The body remains midnight black; no light escapes
   this black hole of a liquid.
Flavor / Palate - There is a creamy mouthfeel that permeates through
   the entire beer.  It starts off as a combination of bourbon, cherry, vanilla
   and alcohol.  Next it forms coffee, raisins, plums and blueberries.  As if
   that was not enough there is a textured velvet before it finally decides to
   reveal the coffee flavors one last time.  This is a very dense beer though
   well balanced.  Each of the tastes feels like it belongs; nothing here feels
   out of place or strange.  The finish has a lingering caramel and raspberry
   texture.  I had to sit for a few minutes when the glass was done admiring it
   because it sticks around for a long time.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Delicious vanilla bean, raisin, and a pinch of cinnimon accompany the fruit bouquet.  Tastes even more amazing than it smells, as all of the olfactory sensations are amplified to immense proportions in a harmonious chorus.  Extremely vinous, I can think of more ports than beers that I can relate to the flavors of this brew.  Brandy and cognac smack that far exceeds the quality of any of the aforementioned liquors I have placed my lips on.

Ruddy orange fringe. Holy shit. Aroma is a building steam train of gentle coffees and tahitian vanilla beans steeped in fresh whipping cream and brown sugar. Moves into a supple and not harsh bourbon poured into gingerbread and spice cake. A hint of brandy vapor. Some savory herbal notes, with oregano and tarragon. Sweet candied limes dipped in rum sugars, with a finish of black currant and pears. Flavor is priceless and indescribable. FuckinÂ’ liquid heaven. Really hard to describe because the flavor is so similiar to the flavor, almost to a tee. Palate is a dense, absolutely syrupy sugar elixir that holds, disperses, and perform the flavors with total elegance. Finish and smack carry the very gentle and floral glowing qualities of an exquisite 21-year old single malt. A lot of the rich condensed malt and oaky finish characters ring through. More vinous then beery, with copious rich berry notes and continuing brandy and cognac vapors in the finish. Totally rounded and mellowed by the beers, with NO harsh edges. And the flavors are original each time they touch the palate, without fatigue. Finally, itÂ’s a touch thin, to me, as it could be even denser, but it still has that ubiquitous cold cream texture that stays with the beer and maintains astounding density and quality as the beer continues.

1008,"2004-10-10",4.7,"UPDATED: APR 25, 2006 2002 batch, bottle #2, poured by Peter Zien at the GABF.  Perfect appearance, dark and opaque poured from a pitcher. Wood and bourbon are strong in the nose along with alcohol and underlying roasted dry chocolate. Flavor is also heavily influenced by the barrel aging, with bourbon and wood character evident.  While I say ""influenced"" I donÂ’t mean ""dominated by"".  I had a Rock Bottom Bourbon Barrel Stout earlier, and it tasted like a middle of the road stout with two shots of cheap bourbon thrown in compared to this gem.  This one finishes with a creamy, toffee-like buttery coffee and roasted chocolate malt fade.

1008,"2004-10-04",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 8, 2013 2002 batch, bottle #2, poured by Peter Zien at the GABF.  Definite bourbon in the nose, though not overpowering like many attempts at this style have become.  Still has some big charred chocolate malts, rich smoky bourbon and wood flavors, without too much of a biting ""fresh"" wood flavor, but rather a slightly aged quality which is certainly preferred when it comes to tasting big stouts.  Peppy on the tongue, just slightly hot for 12% ABV, frothy as itÂ’s being swallowed.  Finally itÂ’s soothing as it coats the throat, warming itÂ’s way down.  Rich and dry finish, with some butter rum, a slightly burning caramel flavor, with some light hops but not too strong given the power of this stout.  Within the fad of bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts, this one stands out as one of the best, although I really do prefer a stout to be non-bourbon barrel aged, and I still prefer the standard Speedway Stout over the BA version.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Nice apparent viscosity. Barrel-aging adds remarkable depth and balance to the dominant coffee tones of the ""regular"" Speedway Stout. Emergent qualities include port, tons of dark chocolate notes, and buttery vanilla tones. Incredibly long and rich as it goes down. Very mature and layered like an onion. Barrel-aging was perfected here and not overdone. Sublime stuff.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
1008,"2004-10-04",3.3,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2004 To me, this beer tasted like many of the other Imp stouts in the current US trend of ""bigger is better"" and barrel aging.  No matter who started it, there are a lot of them out there now.  And I do not have the stomach for these concoctions, I donÂ’t mean that they make me ill or anything, but I hardly find them very enjoyable anymore.  They are simply too rich, and too much.  As far as this one, I honestly do not see all that much of a difference between it and many of the others.  It certainly is not a bad beer, but it is in no way the best beer in the world.  I absolutely would not want to drink this often, if at all.  And I do not like coffee!  Some may question the ""2"" for palate, since it is so thick; but I do not see thickness as a good beer characteristic - perhaps several years ago when it would have been a novelty, but after having several thick beers, I have come to the conclusion that syrup is best left for pancakes.

The flavor has loads of alcohol burning the tongue, but it is still very well rounded because it contains strong notes of roasted bread, coffee, and chocolate. It has a magnificent body.

Bottle #19.
This pours black with a weak attempt at forming a head as expected. A complex aroma rises from the surface carrying notes of chocolate, whiskey alcohol, and roast malt. The flavor is very intense and complex as well, playing back and forth between the sweetness and the bitterness from the roast malt. There is a slight whiskey bitterness/sharpness present. The alcohol content is well hidden and the alcohol flavor is pleasant coming from the barrel, not the malt in the beer. Overall, a very nicely done Imperial Stout but somewhat over hyped. Just the same, IÂ’d have another one if it were available.

Burnt wood edges, dark chocolate and espresso, alcohol at the back that was like whiskey.  Finished oaky and dry, lingering bitterness and warmth all the way down my throat.

I must be honest, I was expecting a more silky, tightly carbonated palate from the top beer, though this was good in its own way, however still.  Flavours start with dark roasted coffee-alcohol and melt into black chocolate truffles, bitter raisins, burnt gooey honey, and tangy cherries.  This is a great beer, made by an ever greater brewer(y), and though we did everything possible to keep the bottle perfect (temperature controlled cellar 55 degrees) it does not deserve to be the best beer in the world, a title I feel only monks should be responsible for . . .","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
1008,"2004-05-03",3.9,"Bottle #6 of 115, shared with iwantalambic.  Thick, viscous pour that produced exactly three bubbles, despite the decidedly aggresive pour.  Big roasted coffee aroma with combined elements of cocoa powder, anise, vanilla, oak, bourbon, and subtle hoppiness.  The body is thick and rounded, but could really use some carbonation to help move everything along and give the tongue even something more.  The flavors are nice and really show that this has not been barrel-aged for too long.  The coffee, chocolate, bourbon and vanilla meshed well, though I yearn for a bit of vinous character and a touch more hops.  Ultimately, I am not disappointed by this beer, but I also never thought it could be the best in the world.  It is very nice that the aging was not over done, but it really needs *some* carbonation and a hint of fruit to even consider being the best in the world.

To me perfect means I'd choose said beer over any beer I've ever tasted, and I can't really say that even though it is so damn good.  The aroma of this bottle was a little more alcoholic and astringent than I remenber from the first sampling of this beer.  Overall it is a masterpiece of brewing.  Original Rating:  Bottle #47:  I really loved this beer unlike any other I've come across.  A previous rater mentioned that it may be over-rated based on lack of availability but I completely disagree.  This is a great beer regardless of  it's distribution or availability...it stands on it's own merits. Now for the tasting notes:  It pours a dark chocolate color with a nice small even brown head.  Supurb lacing throughout.  The aroma is absolutely amazing...the bourbon notes inter-mingle perfectly with the coffee, chocolate roasted aromas.  The first thing I noticed about the flavor was the balance between the roasted like bitterness, alcohol and the bourbon.  The cask aging actually helped to balance the somewhat astringent finish of the original speedway.  The body is very full.  It was a pleasure to savor each sip of the beer.

Aroma of sweet chocolatey bourbon and some aged caramel malt.  Body starts fairly full and sweet but doesnÂ’t have much coffee character compared to the fresher non-barrel aged version.  Smooth milk chocolatey palate has decent bourbon character, but doesnÂ’t quite have the freshness and complexity but hides the alcohol well and is very drinkable.  A nice beer, but not a top 10.

2002 vintage bottle 13/115, courtesy of Rodolito sampled on 1/5/04:  Pours a thick oily black with some dark brown around the edges.  Head is almost non-existant with a thin ring of light tan foam.  Rich, robust, complex dark chocolate and bourbon aroma, with hints of caramel and dark fruits.  Starts thick and caramely sweet going through some plum and bittersweet dark chocolate before arriving at a strong whiskey-like, roasted coffee alcoholic finish.  A very nice imperial stout, but I think the barrel aging, although adding a touch of complexity, has greatly increased the feel of alcohol in the finish.  I honestly prefer the normal version, and fear this is a touch over-rated due to its availability.  DonÂ’t get me wrong, this is still a great brew.  Thanks again to Rodolito for hooking me up with this gem!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1008,"2003-12-30",5.0,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2003 Bottle 37/115:  In short, this is like the regular Speedway with added complexity.  Aroma is pretty similar to the regular.  It's heavy on the molasses.  Appearance is awesome.  Very black with just a hint of brown on the edges.  Remaining lace and head is tan-brown.I can hold this up to a 1000W high pressure sodium light and not see any light through it.  Taste is incredible.  The taste hits you on two levels.  Up front, you get the molasses with a little chocolate, coffee, and licorice.  Then it comes back and hits you with more of the same.  My wife says it reminds her of bourbon.  I agree to a certain extent.  I feel like I'm eating a dark chocolate with bourbon a vanilla flavoring inside.  With every sip I have to shout out in delight.  I never want it to end.  This is the greatest beer I've ever had! Sorry Kasteel.","Fallbrook, California, USA","Kasteelfreak"
1008,"2003-12-28",4.8,"Co-Rated with Hopscotch. #40 of 115. Black hole black, tan creamy head.  So much going on in this baby.  Bourbon, toasted nuts, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, oak and alcohol.  Aroma and flavor is the about the same.  Huge full bodied brew which in my book is an instant classic.  Just freakin amazing...","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
1008,"2003-12-28",4.8,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2008 Re-rate... The second batch (originally brewed in 2003, bottle #11 of 125, I think) as of July, 2005, rocked even harder than the first. Smells like a SÂ’more... coconut, chocolate and a campfire roasted marshmallow. My only complaint is that the coffee nuances are almost entirely sucked out of the beer and into the barrel. Who cares? Incredible brew!....Original rating.... First batch... bottle... Co-rated with Scraff... #40 of 115 bottles. This beer rocks!
Pours midnight black with no color... even when held up to very bright light. Light brown, creamy head.
The aroma is of vanilla, roasted hazelnuts, bourbon, dark chocolate, burned cherries, American white oak and alcohol.
The flavor mirrors the aroma with bourbon, espresso, bitter-sweet chocolate and plenty of warm alcohol. Ridiculously full-bodied with an alcoholic mouthfeel and mild carbonation. Lengthy, bitter and burnt-as-hell, alcoholic finish.
This is world class beer! Too bad they didnÂ’t make more of it!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1008,"2003-12-27",4.9,"UPDATED: JUL 3, 2006 Original Sample from Bottle 102 out of 115 (2002): This stout pours with a black as night body topped by a thin to medium thick brown head witha good amount of lacing. Wow, what a different aroma.  The aroma is slightly sweet yet bitter and full of alcohol.  A slightly smokey, woody character shows throuhg reminding me of a nice bourbon.  The flavor is equally unique.  It starts out slightly sweet and malty with a slight alcohol note and turns woody, smokey and roasty with a more prevelent alcohol note.  After drinking half the bottle, the vanilla and licorice notes start showing through.  This is a great beer.  ItÂ’s full bodied, slightly tingly and warming.  Definately a great beer to celebrate Christmas with.

I have had this brew several times since this initial sampling and it keeps getting better and better with age.  IÂ’ve also had the pleasure of trying some of the upcoming releases of it and was again blown away.","San Diego, California, USA","Vac"
1008,"2003-12-15",4.9,"UPDATED: DEC 22, 2004 rerate---Aged an extra  year after release, this beer is amazing.... The alcohol dissapated and its like coffe and whiskey..Bottle 75 out of 115:  I had this expecting so much more than the original, but I was a little dissapointed.  In the dark I could see that it pours a dark brown, not black as the original, and the flavor profile, which had a great smokey, oaky finish to it, was a little stronger in taste alcohol wise.  And again, it poured with almost no head at all.","San Diego, California, USA","Sickboy282"

1008,"2003-12-08",4.5,"12/06/02: Had on tap at Pizza Port Strong Ale FestivalWow.  Wow!  WOW!  Another amazing Alesmith production.  This beautifully dark black stout amazes from start to finish.  Aged in a whiskey barrel cask, the taste of whiskey and chocolate blend together perfectly.  The appearance is a dark black color with a dark tan head.  As you take a sip, all the flavors hit you at once - a great beer.  Kudos to the Alesmith brewers.","Orange, California, USA","Blake"
1008,"2003-12-03",4.2,"str8 outta the barrel in Dec 02: this was probably the best sample as it had whispers of vanilla and oak to add to the complexities../  2002 Bottle/ sampled 03: darker than tupac on a dark alaskan night...tan swirling galactic lather designs gathering thicker at the edges...coffee aromas with subtle hints of vanilla and chocolate bars...rich and thick but a tad bitter at the back of the tongue..extremely heating..smooth..vanilla & chocolate covered fruit flavors..im not getting as much bourbon flavor as others..and i dont get enough bourbon chewiness to it..","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
1008,"2003-12-03",4.8,"A thin head the color of cocoa powder sits on top of the thickest darkest black imaginable. The aroma is enticing but the flavors are the payoff. Coffee and chocolate with vanilla hinting in the background. All rolling across the tongue like liquid velvet.The barrel aging produced remarkable results. Speedway is one of my all time favorites and I didnt think it could improve so much!","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
1008,"2003-12-02",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 22, 2003 This may be surprising, but this imperial poured jet black w/ a small tan head. The taste of the bourbon barrel aging was quite evident. between the bourbon overtones and the coffee flavors, it made for a very nice stout.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
1008,"2003-11-29",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2006 Rich, dark pour with chocolate taste. You can definatly taste the bourbon from the barrels this was aged in. Sweet finish, roasted coffee all the way through. A work of art. The newest version is just a bit too much bourbon though.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
1008,"2003-11-28",5.0,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2003 2002 Vintage - Bottle #44 of 115:  Sampled from 53 deg F to 61 deg F.I shared this bottle with my wife, flutetokill. Pitch black color with a small light brown head. The aroma was very decadent...sweet bourbon, licorice, dark chocolate, cherry. The flavor was huge (like everything else about this beer) with tons of chocolate, coffee, bourbon, sweet fruits, and licorice. The aftertaste is a strong licorice tone with warming alcohol in the throat. The feel was very soft, smooth, thick, oily, and sticky. One of the biggest differences between this and the regular Speedway Stout is that you don't have that crispness here...it works much better. This is the first beer that I've had that seemed perfectly complete, well thought out, and masterfully crafted. It was a completely pleasurable experience. Yee-Haw!!!!","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"
1008,"2003-11-28",5.0,"Bottle #44. Wow! This is one amazing beer. Deep black color with a small light brown head. Huge aroma, full of chocolate, coffee and bourbon. Huge, perfect flavors of chocolate, bourbon, coffee. I can feel the alcohol more than I can taste it. Very thick, creamy feel with the perfect amount of carbonation. Truely amazing!

1008,"2003-11-19",4.6,"This was the barrel aged Speedway courtesy of dasilky1 at the So. Cal. RB gathering.  Poured black as coal and nearly as thick with virtually no head.  Aroma is intoxicating (must be the additional alcohol content from the bourbon barrels), clocolate, molasses, bourbon and hops. Delicious flavor, figs, coffee, dark chocolate syrup and alcohol.  Mouthfeel is syrupy thick with little carbonation.  An amazing brew.","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"
1008,"2003-11-18",5.0,"What a great great brew this is.  Good solid chocolate aroma. This is black as black can be.  Excellent deep chocolate flavor with a perfect amount of bourbonish alcohol seeping through.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
1008,"2003-11-17",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 14, 2004 Brewed in 2002:#7 of 115:  Jet black pour. Small,dark brown,almost grey head.Smallest,creamy bubbles form a  nice full ring,with sticky lace. Potent bourbon,wood, aroma. Maybe some chocolate. Elegant mouthfeel. Extremely soft,silky,and full. Chewy,chocolate,bourbon/wood,coffee flavors. Lots of dark fruit. Finish is soft,chewy caramel,coffee,and slightest burnt wood flavor. Lingering coffee and chocolate. Dessert and coffee in one. So soft and creamy it is extremely drinkable. Much more smooth and refined than the 2003 I had the other day.","Evansville, Indiana, USA","raindog"
1008,"2003-11-17",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2004 Everything about this was planned to be marvelously decadent and did not disappoint. The perfect amount of bourbon. Texture was a velvet wash of creamy dark chocolate with a top-notch (think Jamaica Blue Mountain) espresso thickness. Hint of licorice and toasted coconut. Molasses-like mouthfeel. The liquid version of drinking a Girardelli flourless torte. I imagine some ripe raspberries and pound cake alongside this delight.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
1008,"2003-11-17",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2006 Opaque charcoal. Small caramel ring eventually  find its way to the top. Soft, inky smooth mouthfeel. Extremely still carbonation. Monstrously elegant toasted wood, coffee and vanilla notes, giving way to a rich layer of fudgy, aged malts. Voluptuous toasted wood backdrop with the traditional coffee/tar Speedway character, only with seemingly less alcohol. Tingly plum skin, fudge, and vanilla lead the way into the finish with more toasted wood/caramelized flavors than bourbon. The toastiness thwarts  the sweetness and ups the complexity. The wood-aging worked wonders  here, though it could stand to be beefier and more complex.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1008,"2003-11-16",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 26, 2004 Rated 1/7/03 straight from the tap. Kudos to Alesmith! What a beer. The bourbon cask version is simply amazing. Again, thanks to OÂ’BrienÂ’s for the excellent tap list. A sinful, opaque black that is so powerful it bends light in its direction and absorbs it. Fluffy, creamy, cocoa colored head. Velvety smooth. The 12% alcohol is only barely noticeable. Chocolate aroma that made my stomach growl. The strong coffee aroma present in the regular version was greatly subdued. Beautiful, rich mouth feel. Delicious chocolate, coffee, and vanilla flavors. None of the coffee acidity that is present in the regular version (when first released). The regular version has a much more pronounced, intense, quality coffee flavor. Each has its pluses.","San Diego, California, USA","rodolito"
