1761,"2016-07-16",2.8,"A very brown ale type of lager. Sweet, roasted malt nose with a touch of grassy hops. Clear brown pour with thin, quick foam. Sweet malt taste, medium body. Slightly dry on the finish.","Pennsylvania, USA","PanMarek"
1761,"2016-07-09",3.3,"Can. Presents and drinks more like a brown ale (though its a lager) than an amber/Vienna. Kind of a hybrid. Nice caramel and roasty brown malt aroma and flavor, with a crisp bite at the end. Sessionable.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
1761,"2016-05-15",3.7,"16 oz can at the 2016 Aiken Bluegrass Festival. Clear dark reddish brown body with a very good head. Smoke dark roasted malt flavor. Light hint of smoke but no char.
Overall: a robust brown ale worth seeking out.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
1761,"2016-03-06",2.2,"16 0z can, pours crystal clear amber to chestnut with a fizzy large bubbly head of one finger which rapidly diminished to a thin covering. Aroma of caramel brown sugar. Crisp but thin and watery, overly carbonated a bit. Short on flavor. Not really impressed. I fail to understand why a microbrew beer automatically commands a higher rating than a similar macrobrew.","South Dakota, USA","tatinek"
1761,"2015-10-16",4.2,"Can. Absolutely the best can beer I have ever had. Medium brown with a medium head. Aroma was nutty, chocolate. Taste was a pleasant roasted nut with a chocolate overtone and a hint of coffee.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","tnkw01"
1761,"2015-10-07",3.8,"Draft, Harbour Public House, Bainbridge. Med chestnut, aroma is pretty rich maltiness, sort of toffee/brown sugar note. Rich taste...same characteristics. Sweet, but not cloying. Full body. Really nice amber lager...definitely aiming high for a Vienna.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1761,"2015-09-19",3.9,"16 ounce can.

It pours a clear mahogany with an ample head of off white foam. Good lacing ensues.

The smell is sweetish, has a nuttiness, light grain, minimal bitterness.

Malty taste with mild sweets, bit of a nutty character, light grain and chocolate, mild bitterness. Mild...thats what this beer reminds me of. A Mild Ale.

Light bodied but not watery, good mouthfeel.

Very nice 4.2% abv beer!","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"

1761,"2014-04-27",3.7,"Draught. Pours a clear brown color with a small head on it. Nose is very toast with some slight roasting to it. Taste has some nice toast to it, with a bit of nuttiness coming through underneath. Nothing earth-shattering, but a very pleasant drink for me.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"

1761,"2014-01-26",3.6,"16 oz can bought from ""Lifesource"" in Salem OR
$2.49
Pours a darker chestnut brown colour with a nice sized thick and creamy tan head.
Nice creamy fudge malty aroma,very welcoming, touch of brown sugar and sweet coffee,slight floral hop.
Taste is similar to the aroma but the coffee is darker and semi-bitter, surprised this is a lager, and like Brewdad says its hard to place.Its a little like Full Sail Session Black...
Mouthfeeel is rather thin but adds to drinkability..carbonation is medium..
Nice session type beer whatever the style is.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"

1761,"2010-12-28",3.6,"Listed as a lager. The nose was of roasted nuts, light crisp earthy hops, and a touch of malty sweetness. Pours brown with a thin head that settles to a ring. Roasted and toasted nuts, hints of sweetness with a clean crisp finish. Very drinkable with nice flavors. Well done.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
