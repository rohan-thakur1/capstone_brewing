3.5 A: Black color. Just about one finger of frothy medium brown head. Retention is a touch below average and just a few wisps of lacing are left.

4.25 S: The smoke in this is just great. It offers both the porcine meatiness and the campfire thing. Quite earthy with a big mineral component. Tangy molasses and dark fruits. Underneath is the typical chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Just a touch of char as well.

4.0 T: Much like the nose. Smoke again leads the way as described above. Strong mineral earthiness. Chocolate and caramel come to the forefront to join the molasses. On the drier side for a beer this big. Coffee and a light char aftertaste to round it out.

-Roastiness is light compared to the style average.
-The mouthfeel is cushy and not too heavy. This is a well leveled dessert.
-Sweetness is important, but not overdone in any way.
-Smoke appears as wooden and spicy in the nose, but then peaty in the finish.

Opaque, near black with a small, creamy brown head and very good lacing. 

Aroma of smoke, roasted malt, and dark bread.  The smoke is more like the sweet, humid smoke from a barbecue, than dry campfire smoke.  Very pleasant. 

Taste of caramel, toffee, dark bread, smoke, peat and roasted malt. 

Full body and high/medium carbonation. 

The smokiness is much softer and rounder than the ashy smoke of a raunch beer.  It balances nicely against the sweet malt flavors.

Body is medium to full, with a higher amount of carbonation on the tongue. In my opinion, the smoky characteristics of this beer are well moderated; many smoked beers can be overwhelming to some (I actually like extra smoky beers), but in this case the smoke doesnt truly manifest until the finish.

3080,"2012-11-08",3.6,"No bottling information.
Appearance: The body is pitch black with a brown creamy head, unfortunately it doesnt have much retention, still its a good looking beer.
Aroma: Smoked meats come to mind first, its certainly the prominent aroma but not overpowering, cocoa and roasted malts are in the background. The aroma is balanced well with a nice sweet and smoky side.
Taste: The intro is of cocoa but it quickly becomes a smoky roasty beer with a little alcohol on the finish and perhaps some hints of licorice.
Palate: Medium to thick bodied and syrupy with medium amounts of carbonation that has a sharp twang to it.
Overall: This is a solid beer, hats off to Iceland. I would gladly recommend this smoky, roasty, chocolate beer to anyone, despite my rating.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

3080,"2012-06-10",3.2,"500ml bottle. My first Icelandic brew. The pour is just about pitch black, showing glints of mahogany in the right light. Moderate in size, a creamy, light brown head slowly deflates to a thin film with a small edge. Sudsy lace mostly rejoins the body. The nose is sweet and smoky, showing a malt-forward base of dark chocolate, reduced dark raisin, caramelized dates, and soft, sweet, mild smoke. The rustic fruitiness reminds me of pipe tobacco. Flavors follow suit, sweet and caramelized, with notes of burnt sugar, charred fruits, bittersweet chocolate, and slightly acrid, earthy, biting smoke. Theres a hint of ashiness as well. The palate is dense and laden with excessive sugars, drinking slow and syrupy. Carbonation is appropriately moderate, but it doesnt do much to quell the laborious quaff. Its not all that boozy, but the ashy finish is somewhat troublesome. Overall, not my thing. At least not anymore. At one time, I wouldve really enjoyed this brew, but in my old age I can hardly get through a glass of it. Thats more a testament to my change in taste than any deficiencies that this beer might show.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

3080,"2012-05-27",3.8,"500 ml bottle.  Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with a half inch tan head that went away quickly.  Theres a small amount of lacing.  The brew smells like smoked malt/meats, chocolate, molasses and coffee.  Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it tastes like smoked malt/meats, milk and bittersweet chocolate, coffee, burnt/charred malt and little bit of licorice.  Theres also a nice lingering bittersweet smoky finish.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its creamy and coating with moderate carbonation.  I think its a solid overall beer, and its definitely worth a try.  $11.49 a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

3080,"2012-05-15",3.8,"Bottle.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, brown, mostly lasting.
Body is black (almost opaque, flashlight tested).

Aroma is moderately to heavily malty (chocolate, roasted grain, coffee, cookie), with notes of vanilla, blackberry, hints of teaberry/wintergreen and smoke.

Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

Well, theres not much smoke in my sample, but thats ok because it still smells lovely.  The malt is clean and rich, and really the only thing that keeps this from being 4+ for me is the sweetness...it needs more bitterness to balance.  It isnt syrupy/sticky, though, so its still remarkably easy to quaff the whole bottle before you know its gone (the 9.4% is almost undetectable in the nose or mouth).

The taste is actually nicely balance, not too heavy on the smoke and you can indeed taste the imperial stout  character of sweet and charred malts, a bit woody and even a touch of espresso like bitterness.

Roasted malt and smoke aromas complement the sweet chocolate scent.  Relatively full-bodied and creamy, initial taste is quite bittersweet.  Roasted malts and chocolate dominate the flavour profile, while smoke is surprisingly not overpowering on the palate.  Alcohol is warming but not boozy.  Roasted malts linger in the finish.

Very nice imperial stout.  Perhaps lacking slightly in complexity and maybe a bit too bitter for my tastes.","Ancaster, Ontario, CANADA","greglikesbeer"

Overall I was a bit underwhelmed by this beer. The smoke was disappointing. I was looking forward to a peat-smoke aroma but it was nearly undetectable.

3080,"2011-07-07",3.8,"In short: A burnt mocha cake, some smoke and plenty of green hops.  Tasty beer
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed relatively fresh, 2.5 years before expiration date.  This bottle from HogtownHarry, thanks big man.
The look: Near black body topped by a small beige head
In long: The nose has some smoke notes, roast, peat, some manure (really!).  This is sure not very smoky for a beer that says smoked imperial stout on the label.  Taste is surprisingly aggressive.  The beer starts with a rich mocha cake but quickly the taste of roast and green hops pellets take over for a very bitter finish that adds some unpleasant cooked asparagus notes.  Other flavors I noted were espresso, grass, smoked peat, bacon, very light notes of raisins.  Overall this was a very nice beer that could have been a kick-ass beer if it wasnt for those light cooked asparagus notes.  A nice beer from Iceland, the badass country that likes to it piss the rest of the world off with its big volcanoes.  Here in Canada we export Justin Bieber and Celine Dion.

Lalcool est tout aussi goûteux et se manifeste encore par des saveurs florales et légèrement piquantes.

I tried this beer in December 20, 2010 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets.  The beer poured a black colour with a brown generous head that reduced itself in half in no time before sticking around.  The aroma is smoked wood, roasted malt, licorice, and coffee.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation.  The flavour is smoked pork, roasted malt, coffee, and some vanilla hints.

App.:  Brown-black with a nice grey-deep mocha foam.

Palate:  Medium-full body, soft, silky effervescence.
  
Flav.:  Lots of chocolate, slightly fruity, still quite a bit of meaty smoke but it takes a backseat (almost) to the malts, some ester hints, alcohol, a little molasses and licorice, still a touch metallic, interesting; sweetness over-shadowed by bitterness, molasses, licorice, smoke and alcohol on the finish.

Finishes slightly dry with just a hint of smoke, and nice warming booze. Goes down dangerously easy. Mouth-feel is full and satisfying with just a mild burning sensation, matched quite well with some subtle creamyness.

Very creamy and dark brown with a head that looked like a chocolate shake. Some smokiness in the aroma, but a lot of malt as well.

A little sweet up front, but there is a boozy bitterness in the finish.  Good body.  Overall, though, somethings just not working here for me.  And its not the smoke.

Puts an opaque black ale in the glass. 2 finger brown cap, moderate retention, good lacing qualities.

Aroma is pungent...all the big roasty malty  tones with the dried fruit esters of a Ruski impy  plus a measured but persistent smoke aroma...very nice nose to this one...well balanced, nothing over powers.

Rich oily mouth, deeply flavorful character.

Flavor starts with BIG smoky-roasty malt body..... mid palate some light sweetness, dark fruit, tobacco, vanilla pod, licorice breaks free of the smoked malts, finish is long as the dark malt char and hopping break out.

Wow this is one big flavor beer with a decent complexity under the smokey malts. Just begging to accompany hearty meat dishes.

3080,"2010-02-10",3.3,"200ml draught. My last drink at the splendid pub called De Klomp, late on a Saturday evening. Medium sized head with a brownish shade. Devil-black body colour. Attractive aroma of peaty malts. Smoked malts in flavour added by a solid touch of sweet liquorice. Sweet dryness to the palate. Well bodied, but gets too sweet.

Not really my thing, thus, but impressive that an Icelandic brewery did this. Not going for a more aggressive beer is probably a good decision when it comes to sales in the home market. Hopefully this paves the way for wilder stuff.","Falun, SWEDEN","Kalli"

3080,"2009-01-19",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2009 Bottled at Sorbon, Bromma, Stockholm.  When I first saw the info I thought that this must surely be a joke. An unknown Icelandic smoked Imperial stout available at a suburban pub (although well reknown) in Stockholm. As I figured that the worst thing thatcould happen was that I lost 1 hour by going the wrong direction on the metro and then drank a good beer Ive already tried I decided to test the truth in the rumour. When I saw the Lava bottle on the counter I was almost shocked. After ordering it I found out it was the last they had, so I had to grab another beer while waiting for the bottle on display to chill a couple of degrees.
Whe finally sampled it poured pitch black with a fair sized beige head. the aroma of sugary and chocolatey. It was sweet and velvetty soft, near full bodied and always non-intrusive. Lightly fruit with warming peppery alcohol coming through the thick layers of sweet chocolate. The smoke is very subtle, but adds a further dimension. Perhaps its too sweet, but the warmth and beautiful softness makes it a perfect winter warmer (and the beer that would suit most days in Iceland, at least in imagination.)","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
