1449,"2017-06-22",3.6,"6/22/2017 (12 fl oz bottle): Caramelized malt with a muted candied citrus hoppiness; handsome orange-amber color, clean and clear, with a three-finger head of lasting, puffy beige foam; toasted and earthy, Continental caramelized malts, slightly bready or cracker in the middle, muted floral and citrus hops, mild to moderate bitterness, spicy at times, earthy and caramelized vegetable - no, its Brazil nut - finish; medium body, very smooth and calm on the palate, good body considering the lower ABV; really great label artwork and good name for the beer, quite good, but not great... plan to put the other half of the sixer in the cellar to see if this beer improves with a bit of aging.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"
1449,"2017-06-21",3.7,"Bottle:
Lightly hazy amber with a creamy beige head.
Caramel, citrus-peel scent.
Taste is mildly bitter caramel/grain malt.
Really nice.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
1449,"2017-06-16",2.1,"Bottle. Nose lightly sweet, malty, crystal, scorch, roast. Pour dusky but still transparent amber, sort of a reddish-orange-tawny with a too-large foamy beige head thats just out of control, overcarbed in the bottle. Too crisp in the mouth, taste of caramel, nuts, grain, touch of spice but not floral, some malt but its thin, mild alcohol, and something very much like Sam Adams house flavor, surprisingly. Crisp, clean medium body but airy and expansive. Would be less offended if they just called it an amber. [2017.06.16: 2.1]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
1449,"2017-06-12",3.4,"Reddish brown, clear, and some spongey foam. Smells like caramel, pumpernickel bread, and a touch of pine. Taste is sweet bread, toast and grassy hops. Maybe a hint of cherry as it warms.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
1449,"2017-06-11",3.5,"Pours reddish copper with an off white head. The aroma creamy toasted malt, apples and some sweetness. It has a medium crisp body with mild carbonation. The taste has some earthy and piny hops, but its a bit more watery than expected. Still pretty good though","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1449,"2017-05-30",3.4,"12oz bottle. Always nice to have an Alt of any sorts. Filtered copper-brown body. Steady off-white head. Not really a perfect aroma, there is something a pinch off. Pleasantly drinkable, medium bodied. Nice interplay between the hops and medium dark malt tones. Just doesnt have the finesse that any of the good to great Alt beers have. Grows on me some because I like the style, but has a faint butter tone in the aroma I cant get over. Still OK, not bad.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
1449,"2017-05-25",3.9,"From old tasting notes. Hazy honey gold color. Thick fine bubble beige head. Spicy aromatic malt nose with hints of fruit. Zesty toasted malt flavor with hints of plums and apple. Pleasing bitter hop finish and aftertaste.","Hamilton Square, New Jersey, USA","gripweed57"
1449,"2017-05-24",3.7,"C. Pours a clear copper color with white head. Well balanced but has a... Unique flavor.","","mjmoen"
1449,"2017-05-23",3.7,"Tap at The Davis Beer Shoppe. Pours dark coppery amber with a beige head. Aroma is mildly roasted malt with a fair amount of hop. Med body at least. Flavor is lightly spicy roasty malt. Not entirely dry, not all that bitter, but it is clean and refreshing. Nice.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1449,"2017-05-21",3.8,"Aroma is medium citrus hops and nutty malts. The flavor is citrus, mild grapefruit, pine needles, nutty malts and a bitter/hoppy finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
1449,"2017-05-19",3.5,"Aroma is earthy hops, toasty, caramel, fruity, bready, decidedly different. Appearance is amber, light tan head, somewhat hazy. Taste is earthy hops, toasted malt, caramel, chocolate, bready, not as fruity as expected, but nicely toasty. Mouthfeel is light to medium body, light carbonation, toasty earthy chocolate aftertaste. Overall, its different for the style, but nonetheless good.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
1449,"2017-05-19",3.8,"Bottle. Orange/lime peel, biscuit malt, and straw. Amber with giant off-white head. Lightly sweet lime/orange, biscuit malt, and moderately bitter/astringent hay flavor. Nice body. Solid.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
1449,"2017-05-19",3.8,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 4/4/2017. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy orange/amber/light copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of grapefruit, melon, pear, apple, caramel, brown bread, toasted biscuit, pepper, pine, light nuttiness/coffee, herbal, floral, grass, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready/light roasted malt and light-moderate fruity/earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, melon, pear, apple, caramel, brown bread, toasted biscuit, pepper, pine, light nuttiness/coffee, herbal, floral, grass, and toasted earthiness. Light-moderate pine/grassy/spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of grapefruit, melon, pear, apple, caramel, brown bread, toasted biscuit, pepper, pine, light nuttiness/coffee, herbal, floral, grass, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malt and light-moderate fruity/earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness and carbonation, increasing through the glass. Very clean flavors, and not yeasty. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.4%. Overall this is a very nice Northern German altbier style. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malt and light-moderate fruity/earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink; with the modestly bitter/drying finish. Definitely fits the style very well; but the amount of hop flavor makes this unique, and more Americanized. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
1449,"2017-05-19",3.4,"12 oz bottle; kind of an art nouveau graphic on the label. undated. 
Pours with a fine looking, clear brown body topped by a thick and durable beige head. 
Very hoppy aroma for style, but then this is an Alt ""nouveau"". Earthy Euro style hops rather than fruity or piney ""american"" style. 
Flavor: more traditional, but relatively hoppy. 
Feel: Medium body with medium carbonation.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
1449,"2017-05-13",2.9,"355ml bottle. Altbier is a style that I cherish and too many brewers fuck it up. This is just toast-flavored beer, nothing more, it is not an altbier.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
1449,"2017-05-12",2.3,"Sampled on draft at 3R6P this beer poured a caramel color with a medium sized creamy off white head that left decent lacing. The aroma was toasty malts, floral hops and almost celery. The flavor was bitter and dryish with notes of celery and perfume. Long finish. Medium body. Not good.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
1449,"2017-05-06",3.5,"Pours a clear medium iced tea / caramel color with a thin tan head. Pleasant aroma of light malts. Thin body with some lacing. Light and refreshing malty taste with some berry flavor. Not harsh or bitter. Light lingering aftertaste. Enjoyable but not that great.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","jsporrer"
1449,"2017-04-22",3.7,"12 ounce bottle. Deep reddish caramel color with a light caramel hoppy taste. Pretty good.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
