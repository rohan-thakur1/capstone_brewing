The pour is a nice hazy golden orange color with a thick white head that slowly recedes with a light soapy lace left. The aroma is pretty damn good. There is a nice dry oak and a good citrus acidity up front. A good mineral addition comes through with a lovely funkiness and a hint of brett. The flavor is much of the same. Its balanced, sour, tart, citric, funky, and just everything you want. The mineral addition is a little surprising, but well balanced.

Deep orange with a small head. Clings nicely. Maybe its just this bottle, but it lacks a bit of the impressive stature of regular Oude Geuze.

Awesome peppery funk aroma. Heavy hay. Tang citrus that hints towards its sourness. Pepper above all. I love the way 3F gueuzes smell.

Citrus flavor is more prominent. Orange. Wheat graininess. Pepper in the finish with less funk and a touch of oak.

Medium body. A bit heavy for the style and lowish carbonation. Not as effervescent as Id like.

I dont know if this is better than regular Oude Geuze. I guess Id need to try them side by side. Armand blends the best gueuzes and this is no exception. Phenomenal.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

Lovely aroma, exactly what youd expect from the Fonteinen terroir. Acidic stone fruits, green apple, lemon tartness, mineral water, moderate acidic, super horsey funk, sweaty feet, a bit of barnyard hay, cork, & a nice helping of wet moldy oak towards the back end, proper tannic finish.

Musky funk hits hard; lots of wood, moderate horseblanket, wet hay, old cork, & a bit of sweat in the finish. Tons of wood & white grape in the back-end with a very faint acetic dip, leading to a dry, tart finish. Wow. This is better than fresh 3F Oude Geuze; it is more tart, yet more complex & subtle all around. The oak is more tame as well, & blends with the wild yeast perfectly.

Little carbonation but crystalline, spiky sharpness on the tongue with a puckering dryness that lingers.

Slightly hazy golden with a medium mostly lasting white head and some lacing. Aroma of 3F funk, fruity notes, cheese, barnyard, hay and green apples.

EDITED: Bottle (750 ml) @ In de verzekering tegen de Grote Dorst on May 25th 2014. Vintage 2002 with ""Felix de Boeck"" label. Hazy bright golden with a medium off-white head and some lacing. Theres a lot of peppermint aroma like in some other old 3F gueuzes I had recently along nice funk, hay, some dusty notes and apple notes. Taste is fresh with pepperming, leathery brettanomyces and nice gentle funk but it also have a really mature and smooth aspect with dust and hay. Medium body. Medium/lively carbonation. Dry finish. Another superb 3 Fonteinen aged gueuze that I would love to drink on a regular basis. Just plain awesomeness. 9-4-9-5-19 = 4.6 

EDITED: Also had the regular label OGV 02 at home. Really similar to the 02 Felix de Boeck one. So smooth and mature. Extreme drinkabality. Nice minty feature. Perfect balance. Its hard to get any better than this.

On August 22th 2015, we had a vertical of OGV 02 to 08 (all were 750 ml except the 04). Favorite for me were 04 (super musty, really complex), 03 (bright and easy drinking with vibrant funk) and 08 (minty, fresh, funky). Least favorite, but still pretty good, were 06 (lightly carbed, a bit acetic) and 07 (St. Valentin synthetic cork, not much going on in this one). The 02 was a bit of a disappointment as well as we had a bottle of the same batch stored in the exact same conditions about a year ago that was a top-5 ever beer for me, but this one was ""just"" good.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

1119,"2013-04-04",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2013 Updating this rating to reflect my notes & score of the red label 2002 OGV graciously shared by Jacob at our pre-Zwanze Day share in NOLA on 9/13/2013. 

Anticipated straw-colored hue is stained a mildly orange-copper color, likely from the oak barrels.  Plenty of dense, white head protects the liquid below with stubborn discipline. 

Embrace the funk!  Massive aroma of barnyard funk, soured grains, horse blankets, citrusy zest, and freaky dankness erupt from my glass.  Jesus. 

Taste is nice, yet fails to deliver at the same level of excellence set by the appearance & aroma.  Earth and oak meet traditional lambic; turns grassy and funky for a bit before finishing dry and honestly a little watery.  Sourness is in check throughout. 

Delicious, sure, but this is a significant step below Blauw & Crianza (despite being older than both).  2003 OGV is the same way.  Its unfortunate that Armand set the bar so high with those two masterpieces, as every highly-regarded gueuze of his I drink summons comparisons to them.  But all of that aside, I quite enjoyed this brew. :) 
2007 OGV rating from 4/4/2013: 
Traditional gueuze funk, strong presence of barnyard hay and grass. Dry, prickly carbonation. Crisp and easy to drink, but honestly not memorable in any way. 

My friends all fawned over how good this was, which further reinforces that Im just not that into most 3F gueuze -- regular or vintage. Or maybe Im just spoiled by Blauw. 
Score for 2007 OGV: 7,4,7,3,14 = 3.5 total.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"

1119,"2013-01-19",4.2,"375 ml bottle via trade from Boutip. Thanks, Phil. I cant wait till the next! Pours a well hazed orange amber hue, healthy haze intertwine, some nice big carbonation through the body, good glow, hazy middle. Striking big tannish head is cakey and huge, starts to die and remains a decent cakey layer, ok lacing overall. Lots of carbonation. Aromas offer big lemony and lactic elements, yogurt and big citrusy bite, sour and inviting with some bretty funk, bread, cobwebs, and dust as it settles in. A gentle mushroom, funk grows. Sour spritzy feel sticks and dominates, quite lovely. Some crab apple, lemon, and gentle pear. Rich fruit, sour fruit flavors, a kiss of dough, rich lactic, the brett grows as it settles in. Just lovely. Initial is medium body, a bit lighter, quite drinkable, with some rich sourness up front. Lactic and lemony, crab apple, some pear. A bit harsh but up my alley, sour and lactic, a touch metallic. Yogurt, rich lemon, metal. Some barnyard, funk, gentle dough and straw into the middle get to the beer that is left. Funky, straw, and cobwebs. Some barnyard, straw. Dry overall, thin, with some rich sourness throughout. Id say it lacks the balance youve come to expect from regular Oude Gueze and will show some powerful sourness up front without acidity, perhaps some metal or vomit to others, but overall a really fun and flavorful beer, well balanced offering compared to American sours which become acedic messes quickly.. this never does at all. Consider this the Gueze you measure against American sours as far as being assertive. Its intense, a touch too much for many, but I dig it. I like the front end and the nose is heavenly.

A: This beer is a yellowish color, slightly hazy, with a white fizzy head that fades rapidly, leaving no lacing,

S: I would like to quote Paul here: ""This beer smells like a nuns crotch"" Um...Ill take your word for it. Pleasant notes of funk, hay, wild yeast. Smells very nice.

T: A very tasty example of the style. The beer is sour, but not as much as I expected. Its quite pleasant and drinkable. There is subtle acetic or vinegar-like note in the finish. I would be more tolerant of this if the beer was more tart / sour overall. There are delicate hints of fruit in the nose and flavor that I find quite pleasant. A very piquant offering from a world class brewery.

M: Fairly low carbonation. Very smooth on the palate.

5.0 A: Mildly hazed light orange color. Three fingers of frothy white head. Retention is very good and thick, glass covering lacing is left behind.

4.5 S: Really nice nose on this as well. The funk is amazing. This might be the most powerful and complex funk Ive ever encountered. Tons of hay and horse. Decaying fruit, stinky sweaty feet, apple orchard, dry rotted sweat socks, old wood. Like most other 3F gueuzes, this is insanely complex with the funk, but not all that sour. Nearly no acetic acid and only mild amounts of lactic acid. Borderline 5.0.

4.0 T: Taste is good, but its not as complex or as overall good as the nose. Theres more sourness, but its a strange dry sourness, which is something Ive never experienced before. Other than that, the funk is still crazy strong, but not quite as complex. Lots of hay, dry earthy woodiness, dry rotted sweat socks, musty basement. Lightly horsey. Mild lemony fruitiness.

3.5 M: Lighter body. Good spritzy gueuzy carbonation. Could use more creaminess though.

4.0 D: This is good and I appreciate the funk, but its a tad bit disappointing, especially given how impressive the nose is. Dont get me wrong, its still a great gueuze, but I expect a lot from 3F when it comes to them.

1119,"2012-03-06",4.1,"From notes.  First reviewed 8/1/2011.  2007 vintage. Poured from a 750 mL caged and corked bottle into a tulip. Thanks goodstrongbeer for bringing this out!

The 2007 Vintage Oude Gueuze pours a cloudy tangerine color with a golden border and a champagne color right at the edge of the glass. A small creamy white head forms initially.

This is a tightly wound aroma of fruit and sour notes. Nice horse blanket funkiness. Tart apples, sour white grapes, and a little woodiness as well.

Up front the flavor is quite tart, with tangerine pushing its way to my palates forefront. An aggressive barnyard flavor comes through. 

This is very smooth, sour, acidic, and dry. A refreshing carbonation keeps this feeling light.

Funky, very complex, and quite enjoyable. As my lambic experience grows, this is definitely one I would like to revisit in order to appreciate more of the complexity that I may have missed. Nonetheless a fantastic beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Look: Initially ALL foam, 30 seconds later head dissipated to 50/50, revealing an amber (light) body
Smell: woodsy, musky, very aromatic. Tasting partners variously described the aroma as ""sweet fermented musk"", ""like a flowery lake house"", and ""like confusing syrup.""

I would rank them in the following order: 2003, 2002, 2005 (Feb), 2007, 2005 (Dec), 2004, and 2006 (bad bottle, I think).

*I am going to rate into one but not going to include the 2006, because it was so damn bad, and would really hurt the overall score.

A - All pour a very similar mirky/hazy golden yellow, fizzy white head, some spotty lacing, bubbles here and there on top. Some had more carbonation then others, but overall, all very similar (and no gushers).

S - Funk, sour/tart notes, lactic notes, lemon peels, barnyard. Most of the vintages were restrained in lip-puckering funk/sour/tart, dont get me wrong, it was there, but not as evident as other 3F sours. I enjoyed this characteristic, truthfully.

T - More sour/tart notes then funk, but a good balance of everything. Nice barnyard, sour funky acidic notes, lemon peel citrus, orange peel, slight touch of oak. Some years were more funky then others, but this is what I tasted overall.

M - Light, crisp, fizzy champagne-esk carbonation, dry finish.

D - It was wonderful to drink 2002-2007 at one time and really makes you appreciate all the various years and maturity/aging. The winner for me was 2003 but it would be near impossible to pick any year (besides 2006) blind.

""This beer smells like a nuns crotch"" - Lunch (he meant it as a good thing)

Aroma is nice and bright with acetic sourness, mild citrus fruit bitterness and some mild lactic notes. There isnt much oak in here, perhaps with age it would get better. I am loving the mild funk on the back end of the aroma though. Its complex, poster child for a great smelling gueuze.

Beer is light and has a lot of carbon in the mouth. Its tart and sour but leads with the sour palate and the tartness is minimal. The acetic is winning I feel in here with a healthy brettish funk on the back end. There is a strong citric character as well. Its semi-fruity if that makes sense. I love the palate connectivity of this gueuze, I wonder what this would be like in 10 years. Its complex and simple simultaneously and I love this beer. Some were underwhelmed by it but its close to perfect as a gueuze can be IMO. I love this beer.

Lovely grapey nose.

1119,"2011-04-30",4.6,"375ml, red label, 2005 vintage received as an extra from PALMEJ1! Thanks a ton Jacob! You are a madman.

Pours a cloudy, very dark golden range color golden tangerine/burnt orange hues when held to a light and a one finger frothy white head that slowly fades into a lasting ring. Sporadic spots of lacing left behind.

Funky, earthy aroma with a heavy barnyard/horsey presence that is countered by crisp light fruit and sweet vinegar. Subtle lactic presence. A bunch of earthy oak along with the funky bugs as well as some grassy straw, cobwebs and musty funk. Hints of apple, pear, grape and tangerine. Extremely complex nose that has my mouth watering. I literally smelled this beer for ten minutes before taking the first sip.

Medium bodied yet fuller than expected with an intensely sour, mouth-puckering flavor that lingers throughout into a sweet, slightly acidic, vinegary tart finish. Very dry and tart up front with only slight acidity in the finish. No solvent or harsh acetic character at all. Extremely funky with lots of earthy oak tannins, bugs and a touch of vinaigrette which is balanced by a slight lactic presence as well as some light fruit. Hints of apple, pear and lemon combined with the vinegar character give this beer a sweet and tart lingering finish that leaves me drooling for another sip. After the initial palate shock this beer proves to be incredibly complex, well balanced and flavorful.

Overall, I had very high expectations for this beer and they were exceeded. With all of its complexity it is still incredibly quaffable. I absolutely loved this beer and hope to get another bottle sometime.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

1119,"2011-03-30",4.2,"Vertical drank for Sean and Carolines engagement party, quite a shame other Chicago Bas couldnt make it for this one, great times. This is the type of beer that just screams to have separate vintage listings as there was such variation. Instead of reviewing each one, this will more be a guide for those interested in the different vintages.
2002 Vintage 750 ml bottle - one of the top 3 vintages of the night. Awesome aroma that was funky but not harsh, wonderful dusty farmyard notes. The taste was just special because it was biting, dusty, floral and sour, yet it wasnt Cantillon sour in that I could drink this all night long. A vintage worth trying.
2003 Vintage 375 ml bottle - This was pretty decent, in the middle of the variations. Was drank simultaneously with an 03 Drie Oude Gueuze and the Vintage destroyed it. Not even in the same galaxy.
2004 Vintage 375 ml bottle - Nothing really stood out here, still good but towards the bottom.
2005 Vintage 375 ml bottle - Somehow this vintage has two bottle dates, a shocking 10 months apart, February 2005 and December 2005. The older one was much better and was in the top 3.
2006 Vintage 750 ml bottle - Hands down the worst of the bunch, Im almost positive this had to be a bad bottle. This was totally malty, tons of caramel and dough with hops, was like a gueuze barleywine. Terrible, I would not drink this again.
2007 Vintage 750 ml bottle - Valentines dating. To me this was the best of the bunch, a little more sour and acidic which I like in my gueuze. Very musky, just wonderful overall. I picked this up at Drie, super happy I have one left.

Pours a hazy golden color with a nice white head and a fair amount of lacing on the way down. The nose smacked me right away with a really pungent horse blanket odor; loads of leather and must. A bit of hay and some slightly sour notes come through as well.

The taste brings on even more funk--its like the sweat of wet leather thats been in a hay loft for the past four years. Just crazy funky. A bit of oak is present as well. Mouthfeel is nice and light to medium with good carbonation, really bringing the flavors through the full palate. Drinkability is pretty good, although as good as this tasted, I didnt immediately feel like I needed more after Id finished my pour.

Is this geuze? It pours the color of the setting sun and smells like a bowl of tropical fruit. Tangerines, grapefruit, nectarines.. this could be an IPA were it not for the acidity.

This one is for the World Cup final because it is a genuine WORLD CLASS BEER. BLINDING.","Essex, ENGLAND","tdtm82"
1119,"2010-07-07",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2012 Bottle, 37.5cl, from trade with jbrus. Vintage 2003. It was a pita to open this one. First there were two cages, the outer sort of twisted into the other one. Then it was quite difficult to pop the cork, one of the worst Ive ever experienced. But it was worth it. It pours a hazy, lively bright orange body with a creamy off-white head taking ages to settle. The aroma has lots of funky, citrusy barnyard aromas, with something peppery in the far back. A little alcohol too it seems. Its tart, refreshing, effervescent and medium bodied, with flavors of lemon, pale malts and funk. Towards the end it has a certain touch of black pepper, quite subtle, but sure present. The finish is lasting, dry and puckering, with lemon and some black pepper hints. A really wonderful thirst quencher, and equally wonderful in your favorite chair with or with some cheese snack. Rating: 8-5-8-4-16-4.1. 100707Bottle, 375ml corked. 2004 vintage, with the same label as Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary). Thanks a lot for sharing OleR. Its an unclear, orange colored beer with a thin, off-white head. Wonderful funky, lemony aroma. Barnyard, earth, old leather, some wood. Lick entering a stable and sticking your nose into and old saddle, with the added joy of a pleasant fruityness. Hay too, layers and layers of aromas building up, Smooth, dry and tart, nicely carbonated. As the aroma, the flavor is just wonderful and complex. Both balanced and incredibly, incredibly tasteful. Lemon, barnyard, leather, something reminiscent of American hops, and with a woody touch. Lasting sourness, with a lot of funky balance. Damn, this is just plain, gorgeous pleasure. Probably as close to perfection I will ever have. Thx a lot my friend, for sharing this one. 111014","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
1119,"2010-07-05",3.0,"750ml dark green bottle topped by  a cork and a wire cradle. Bottled date: 14.02.2007. Bought at Vinmonopolet Langnes Tromsø. Copper coloured body with a slight haze. Circular edge surrounding the rim of the glass. Smell of acid citrus fruits, mellow cheese and old books. Pronounced tartness of grapefruits in flavour along with notes of apples, honey sweetness, dry cheese and yeast. Super dry on the swallow.

The cork pops off as soon as the cage is loosened, but it doesnt gush or foam up.  Pours a hazy orange amber with a big white head.   Aroma is beautiful, tons of musty sour funk, with barnyard, citrus peel and dust.  Initial flavor is a touch dull and oxidized, but quickly blossoms into a bouquet of lemon and grapefruit peel, without the bitterness or astringency.  Lots of funk, barnyard, sourness.  Finish is funky grapefruit peel, with only a trace of bitterness.  Sublime.","Maryland, USA","brainlair"
1119,"2010-07-02",4.6,"2002 Vintage.  For an 8 year old bottle, it has a surprising amount of carbonation.  The cap popped out of the bottle after loosening the cage.  Hazy orange-yellow pour.  Good white head.  Incredibly funky aroma.  Lots of barnyard, earth, wood, and sweat.  Some lemon citrus.  The flavor really surprised.  Theres almost a bit of sweetness as the beer hits the tongue.

A - Golden, brassy orange color with an average sized, foamy, and bubbly white head with a bit below average retention and a thin bubbly lace left.

S - Well balanced hay/barnyard/funk along with some lemon citrus and apple. Has a good juicy aroma along with a touch of a tart and acidic aroma. Perfect balance between the aroma, my mouth is watering and it is very enticing.

T - Similar to the nose. Some funk and tartness with just a hint of sour taste. A lot of fruitiness with some apple and lemon being strongest. Hints of other golden and tropical fruit as well as some earthiness. Some hay and mustiness and a touch of lemongrass. Very well balanced sour.

M - Medium body with a healthy amount of carbonation. Fairly smooth with a drying finish and just the very slightest bit of puckering.

D - Well balanced and not overly sour/tart but has a nice balance.

This was a blind test and the red label came out on top.  appearance was cloudy golden that left decent lacing.  Much sour tartness coming in on the nose.  Taste is dry, sour, but not overpowering.  The red label had a more pleasant carbonation while the yellow label was almost watery with an odd carbonation that took away from the taste.  This rating is for the red label version.  Since my original rating, I have had this beer probably 5-6 more times and it just gets better every time.  I recently drank an 02 red label, and the subtle blend of black and white pepper, leathery funk, and an absolutely perfect mouthfeel lead me to re-rate this brew higher.

Nice finger and a half slightly frothy off-white head, with a light copper burnt orange color; slightly hazy.  Leather and minerals show first in the aroma; sharp acidity; orangey citrus; faint whiff of cream cheese.  Just packed full of flavor: a sharpness at first that is quick to mellow out over the palate; acidic sourness thats akin to sourdough; some woodiness; leather; a bit of funk...just runs the gamut.

1119,"2010-04-10",3.6,"* Whooopshh! * This pretty much describes my sensation as I took the first sip of the 2004 vintage of 3 Founteinens Oude Geueze Vintage series. This is one funky lambic right here, deserving a well-placed onomatopoetikon. Its body, a delicious-looking deep hazy orange goes well with the champagne-like fountain (no pun intended) head. This is extremely complex and powerful in taste: blue cheese, wet autumn leaves, grapes and hay with a sting of grassy hops blended in there somewhere. Sour, with a lingering acidic aftertaste clinging like a film on my palate, beckoning for another sip. Wow. If I hadnt already been through a few lambics before this rating, the Oude Geuze Vintage wouldve put me completely on my ass. Sooo strange, and yet very refreshing and drinkable. So much flavor, such an intricate blend. I cant believe this is only 6 % ABV; the vinous, bubbly palate is much more reminiscent of an 11 % champagne or something similar. All in all, the Oude Geuze Vintage from The Year of Our Lord 2007 is very nice, but regardless of all the originality I dont think I wouldve been able to drink more than a bottle of this at any given time. Lambics are just a tad bit too strange to become an ordinary commuter passenger on my platform.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

Tasted both alongside the 3F ""vintage special edition"" with the red artwork bottled on the exact same day in 2002! Had three blind samples. One was doubled up. I was able to pair the two that were from the same bottle together. These were more watery and slightly less sour and complex (ended up being the gold foil, yellow label, normal ""vintage"" label shown here). The yellow label has more carbonation, white pepper, citrus fruits. The nose has amazing moldy white grapefruit and citrus rind. Mouthwatering palate. 3/23/2010 8/4/7/4/15=3.8750mL 2002 Red Label thanks to OldStyleCubFan and later from MrChopin. The red label alongside the yellow label is slightly better albeit very subtly since they are the same batch but the red label stayed in Armands storage for two years or something longer. Proper storage has lent the red label a brighter, fuller nose even with softer carbonation. More cedar, spice, pepper, barn. The taste is still white pepper, grapefruit, mouth watering sour with bright citrus and fruity tangerine. Still excellent and slightly better than the Yellow Label. 1/11/2011 8/4/8/5/16=4.1750mL 2002 Yellow Label thanks to BrainLayer at Sour Epic Part 2. We had this next to some of the best sours in the world and this one I enjoyed more than J&J Rose and J&J Blauw back to back. This bottle was just on the ball. Juicy nectarine nose, big Brett C tropical notes. Taste is sharp, juicy, dry and dusty with loads of moldy grapefruit and huge citrus zest. Incredible white pepper, orange peel, grapefruit onslaught. Awesome stuff. Probably the best 3F beer Ive had besides past tastings of J&J Rose. Hot damn. 12/11/2011 9/4/9/5/18=4.5 750mL 2002 yellow label thanks to BrainLayer. Okay. Lets crack this bad boy once again. Is it really the best beer of all time? Cork pops off with aggression. Pours is hazy, deep orange with beige mousse. Thicker. Quickly settling. Nose is perfect. Mild celery seed gets demolished by overripe peach and red grapfruit which yield to overwhelming fresh birch and cedar with hay and horsey dry funk. Cobwebby old character is juxtaposed with fresh and fleshy overripe peach. An insane experience. Taste is ultra quenching white grapefruit peel with sharper wood shavings. So much old dried citrus peel plays with wood and hay. Palate is perfection. Effervescent and juicy with briny saltwater demanding this be drunk in large, quenching gulps. Its disappears so quickly from the glass. What can you say? Is the best beer that which demands a slow savor, or that which demands its consumption with boundless temptation and seduction? This is probably the best beer ever made. Like the big brother to Beatification which passed on its power but will never yield the throne. 1/22/2012 10/4/9/5/19=4.7750mL Yellow Label 2002ed thanks to ryan. Pours cloudy, lower haze orange. Medium, fluffy off-white head. Nose is very fresh and perfumey tangerine, moldy white grapefruit, super intense bleu cheese and blood orange. Taste is spicy, juicy, quenching blood orange. Palate is out of this world- so fresh, leathery, quenching, lactic. Not as aggressive as Armand&Tomme, juicy and soft.

Vinegar, champagne, leather, blue cheese, a hint of vegetable.  Flavor is probably the closest to champagne of any beer Ive tasted.

1119,"2009-10-12",4.6,"Bottle, dated 2005/12/04 and consumed in September 2009.  The pour yields a progressively more hazy, brassy, golden-amber colored body.  A moderate head of foamy, off-white foam settles slowly to a think, lasting blanket, wet lacing mostly rejoining the body.  The aroma approaches perfection, enticingly tart and fruity with notes of peach, lemon, soured apricot, and big, funky, buggy wood.  Barnyard must, horseblanket, and hints of wild grasses impart earthy depth, enhancing the citric acidity beautifully on the nose. The flavor proves to be the perfect counterpart, initially shockingly tart, but settling in quickly to deliciously balanced and juicy.  Peach, apricot, nectarine, and lemon again rule the day, with spicy, musty, saturated oak lending its signature funk.  Bright and vibrant in the mouth, the palate is zesty and refreshing, acidic and puckering, yet even keeled and semi-dry.  This is simply a masterful creation.  Absolutely one of the best beers on planet Earth.I also had a bottle from 2003/07/03 at De Heeren van Liedekercke within a few days of the above rating.  Slightly less impressive, this vintage maintained the same general direction yet fell short in terms of intense focus of both flavor and mouthfeel.

1119,"2009-06-28",4.3,"37,5 cl, bottled in 2005. As the website home.scarlet.be/pajottenland wrote, I conserved the bottle lying and I tried to pour it out like it should be. However I forgot to empty the first few centiliters and  to let the beer run over a bit, I held the bottle and the glass diagonal (to avoid the yeast coming into the glass), turned around the glass first so the Gueuze was touching the whole glass and indeed: I had a fantastic white head. Even when the glass was empty for 3/4 I still had a medium lacing white head. There were some bubbles however in this hazy golden-orange beer.  I poured it out in a 33 cl Jupiler-glass, because this one was resembling the best a Gueuze-glass. Thanks to the previously announced website for giving me those hints! The beer itself then: the smell was attacking my nose with a rather sharp sour taste, with also some tastes of fruit making it milder. The taste was also fantastic: first of all you have the sour taste of a Gueuze, but it is not too sour, because it is very well balanced with a fruity aftertaste. There are also some notes of wheat. This is also a very refreshing beer, certainly because I drunk it when it was hot. It was a pity the glass was empty, because I enjoyed the beer so much. Oh, and with the little gueuze left in the bottle: throw it away, because all the yeast is in that last 2 cl destroying all the good taste (luckily I only tasted those last 2 cls when my glass was already empty).

Light bodied, heavily carbonated mouthfeel with a dry, prickling carbonation and mild acidity.  Not nearly as acidic as many gueuzes, but abounds with brett-induced funk and a plethora of fruity ester nuances, especially apricot and peach.  Moderate tartness with some grape skin tannins, but the funky fruity notes that emerge on the palate are what make this truly remarkable.

#2 Birthday beer.
Pours clear golden with a medium, frothy, white head. Fine duration  lots of bubbles - impressive for a gueuze. Aroma is very nice, some cellar, lots of green apples, funkiness, lactic and citric acids. Still maintains a softness and elegance with just a tad of vanilla and oak. Highish carbonation, super dry mouthfeel. Just a tad on the watery side. Flavour is tart, but not overwhelmingly so, apples, citric and lightly lactic. Very soft and nice, but not near the best gueuzes IMHO.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"

I recall it was straw colored and very hazy with a nice white head.  The aroma and flavors were extremely well balanced but not overly sour.

Prickly vinegar and lemons on the tip of the tongue with citrus meat and dry oaky notes following.. vinegar and Bretty funkage were laced throughout, and this maintained tremendous balance the whole way.. finished long and sour with apple skins and funk.

1119,"2007-12-30",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 2, 2008 2004 consumed in 07. Hazy orange liquid rolls from the bottle, awesome lively carbonation generating and sustaining a thick and creamy white head that is reluctant to recede, eventually mostly diminishing and remaining creamy. Incredible liveliness for vintage lambic - no doubt this wouldve endured multiple decades of careful storage with grace and little degradation. Barnyard funk is focused and penetrates multilayered acidic citrus attacks, a barrage that, at its core, is floral and heartwarming. Must is off-centered and releases cobweb and doctors the overall profile to create a very formidable powerhouse that doesnt overexcel in any one area, but feels boisterous and vigorous from afar and until the glass is drawn from the nose at long last. Lemon, followed by orange and soft sour pomegranate, play the leading roles in the citrus character affront. Pineapple juice-soaked Ridgeway Blue cheese seems to be a crust at the outlying borders of each inhalation. Nearly perfect in every imaginable way. The flavor accelerates acidic tendencies and stifles mustiness initially. Bitterness is soft and soothing, sweetness is medium but recedes quickly. Sourness is moderate and refreshing, never overpowering. The finish is subtly drying, ever-so-slowly beckoning another contemplative sip(or gulp, its too tempting). The mouthfeel is soft and light-medium bodied, with silken carbonation and a completing velvety blanket and malt. A staple this would be, were it available to me. Oh, pity.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Goat cheese, feta, and blue cheese with bold pungency; watermelon, berries, and pepper in the lighter moments, though again dominated by the must, mold, and wet cat.  The sour burst of taste is all lemon juice at first, though a lovely, light sweetness of almond runs through it, giving way to vinegar, wet juniper and ginger dressing.  Rather tepid, but still exciting and bracing in its presentation.  Pears, apples, sweetened lemon even it out.  Light, and brilliantly dry in the mouth, finishing with a lot of tang and perfect animalistic funk.  Perhaps even a bit more bizarre than expected, especially for a comparitively young example.

1119,"2007-10-25",4.1,"April 16, 2002 Vintage Bottle, Sampled October 2007
Pours with a lightly hazy, cherry tinged, light amber color (quite dark for a Gueuze / Lambic) and is crowned by an initially two-finger thick, light tan colored head that is a mix of large and tightly beaded froth that leaves some lacing patterns on the sides of the glass as it recedes.  Ah yes, the aroma is just want I need; funky, woody,  tart and fruity, it smells oh so good.  Aromatic notes of cured leather, ripe plastic (in the process of curing), urea, dried mushrooms and a touch of farmhouse cheese are all noticeable.  The aromatic tart notes run the gamut from hints of lactic, acetic, definitely citric, with notes of tart apples, sour grapes and even some touches of tart, exotic fruit.  Other aromas of rotting wood, cedar, spicy oak, damp cellars made of stone and thick-amply-aged wood structure add more complexity to the aroma.

Soft and almost creamy up front before the acidity kicks in.  The acidity is never hard or overbearing though (which I sometimes like and even crave in a Lambic) and in fact melds quite well with a substantial (for a Lambic) texture & body.  The acid is most notably lactic in character, but has touches of citric flavors at times.  Notes of crab-apple, un-ripe star-fruit, touches of grapefruit (and even more than that at times) and a green, un-ripened, sauvignon blanc grape flavor add to the fruit component of this beer.  Despite the supple texture and heft of this beer it seems quite bone dry.  The carbonation, though light for a Gueuze, adds a zesty textured touch of froth to each sip.  The flavor is not quite as funky as the aroma was, but this is still quite funk driven.  Flavors of woody mushrooms, damp leather in the finish, cherry pits, most definitely musty and even a bit moldy at times.  Touches of ephemeral vanilla, butter cream flavors (or is that just evoked from the texture), uriatic acid (cat pee to the layman) and wild flower petals add to the subtle backdrop of this beer.  Quite tannic at times, almost coating the mouth, though not the teeth like a very tannic green tea, in light astringency.

I could wish for a bit more carbonation here as I like my Gueuzes to be very effervescent, but this is a damn fine example of the art.  Very well blended, very well integrated, there is nothing that is dominant here.  I do love a good Lambic, Gueuze especially, and I wish that I had the ability to drink more of these on a regular basis.  Almost a bit too refined for my tastes; still rustic though and definitely a finely crafted product, but I think I prefer the regular non-vintage, and the 1995 vintage that I had in 2001.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
1119,"2007-10-16",4.3,"2002 vintage - hazy bright and dark orange colour with a little white foam; very complex aroma of hay, rhubarb and grapefruit; medium-bodied, juicy and very acidic; somehow smooth; very long acidic aftertaste with more dust, vinegar and rhubarb - a great beer!","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"
1119,"2007-09-17",4.5,"25 oz bottle, 2002 Vintage, via anders37, tasted side-by-side with a regular 3 F Oude Gueuze, Vintage 2004.  Absolutely perfect pour, slightly hazy gold under a nice fizzy foamy slightly off-white head that left some nice fine lacing.  The nose is just great as well, funky dry cellar mustiness with some granny smith apples, lemons, a little pixie stick dry sugariness and barnyard bretty funk.  Really no yogurty or cheesy funkiness that dominated the younger 2004 regular version.  Just a really mellow well aged gueuze that really hits the sweet spot of what I want.  The flavor is tart and a little acidic with a ton of dry cellar dust and must.  Lemon tartness and funky brett interplay perfectly.  A lingering oak and earthiness fades slowly on the finish.  Mouthfeel is completely attenuated leaving a crisp fairly light bodied feel with perfect lively spritzy carbonation.  This was truely great, and by far outshined the younger version in terms of drinkability.  Though the younger was beautiful in its own right.  I only wonder whether it was the lambics that went into the different bottles or simply the age of the bottles that made the huge difference.  I cant wait to see how the J&Js stand up to this.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

1119,"2007-09-09",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2008 April 12, 2002 Vintage. Poured from a 750ml Thanks to Jason. Aroma wicks forth with a flicking tongue of spring essence in a cherry orchard. Blossoms all around. Cottony wafts, sugars flaunt and a wheat essence plays with persimmon seeds and Passionfruit juice in a soft balance. Fleeting ginger. Pours that clear even gold, headed with mountains of residing billowy foam, lubricious in its delivery. Bubbly and alive. Flavor arrives in resplendent glory, with gentle tannins, refined sweetness and lots of elegant cotton. Pear juice and lemon oils. Tart, puckering and full of the necessary farm yard. This was tasted side by side with the standard Oude Geuze and this was hands down the winner. This maintains complex acidity and brightness, yet holds such refined softness and gentle, pleasing flavors. The young has cheese, wildness, wood and acid, this restrains those a little bit and yields soft spice, grassy fields and sunlight. Awesome stuff.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

There are those Vervifontaine-style wildflowers, violets and fresh-cut grass with something thats reminiscent of the Pajottenland countryside itself - cowdung? Balsa wood, sawdust, cherries, pepper, lemon rind, sherbet, musty cobwebs and moisturiser all get a bit of a run too, with some prickly volatile acids getting into the nasal cavity. Very dry and quite light-bodied with no real initial sweetness at all, before an assertive but certainly not aggressive orange juice tartness which persists for quite some time. What certainly is aggressive is a rough, astringent, woody, stale hop bitterness which is alright and quite interesting but does get a bit much in parts, giving a finish like super-strength tonic water. Mouthfeel is quite round, with only moderate carbonation, but the considerable tannic presence makes it quite interesting. The bitterness is a bit awkward but this is still delightful stuff. Really bright flavours, vibrant and fresh. Its quite amazing to think its already four years in the bottle. Top stuff.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

Lightly cloudy golden orange colored body with a large yellow and white, billowy head... beautifully presented.  Nose of subtly soft musty sourness, intensely puckery, acidic, caustic and more.  Fruity, frothy crackers and dry pears and resiny sap.  Exceptional soothing aftertaste.  I found myself noting that this was similar to a few Cantillon gueuze and lambik bottles.  Everything about this beer is astounding.

1119,"2006-05-20",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 6, 2014 2002 vintage (2006 release) 375mL bottle from Engelsmann, shared with SuIIy on 5/20/06.Magnificent pour, though that hardly needs saying, as the intrigue lies not in the appearance of these wonderful beers.  ""We"" all know that the appearance is perfect.  Enough said.The nose plays a familar tune as lively brett, deepened by a growing lactobacillus influence dries things heavily.  Musty, old yeasts, near the plasticy/rubber, but without all the brashness and exuberance of that one.  But for sure, this is anything but dull.  I think this grows cheesy, as SuIIy points out quickly.  It better get funky, and it certainly does.  Though without the oily pediococcus and clear oak streaks.  I apologize for comparing it, so blatantly to Cantillon, but its only meant to be flattering.The palate is, surprisingly tame and rather loose for a gueuze.  Though never watery, with a full (as full as fully attenuated can get) and quenching body.  Well, getting back to the flavor, first sip again shows tons of Orval-esque brett before you get blown out of the water by hard lactic acid.  Certainly much more serious than any previous Oude Gueuze done here, and very promising.Joris enters it as a new beer, and I had no idea why, but after tasting it, its just so clear.  The aroma and first couple of notes dont remind me, but the middle and finish remind me strongly of de Cam 2001 oude gueuze.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1119,"2006-05-20",4.5,"750ml bottle gratiously shared by ClarkVV on 5/20/06. Pours a dark golden color with a small white head. Loads of tiny bubbles stream throughout the glass racing towards the top. Nose is some sour lemons with a touch of cheesiness and some light musty funk notes. A very fresh scent to it. Palate is quite fizzy and much sourness on the tongue. Leaves a great film on the palate and a big sour bitterness in the finish. Flavorful notes of  Lemony citrus sourness, some more great cheese notes, leaves an everlasting sour note on your lips. My palate is torn between sour lemon and very strong cheese notes that leave a bit of dryness in the mouth. Some more dry fruits mingle into the scene trying to avoid the sourness and make themselves noted, light apricot and tangerine the main battlers. That cheese essence is so strong and forceful, it leaves a nice thick taste in the back of your throat. To conclude, Id like to thank ClarkVV for the chance to try this even though he opened it on accident and finish by saying this is amazing, complex and delightful.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SuIIy"
