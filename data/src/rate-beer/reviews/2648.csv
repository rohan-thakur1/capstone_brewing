2648,"2015-05-06",3.7,"Had two 500mls, cold from fridge 4 degrees C. Aroma is pleasant but not overly strong - particularly when sitting under a 3 to 4 finger head. Pours beautifully lightly golden / straw coloured in a Weizen glass (630ml glass for a 500ml bottle) with the head coming just over the top of the glass without spilling. If using another type of glass beware it is highly carbonated. Head does hang around like a wiezen should, but dissipates more quickly than some of the competing brands. Limited lacing which is why the appearance is a 4. 
Taste is spot on for a Kristall Weizen - Refreshing with only a hint of bitterness, slightly less flavour than a hefe. I struggle to separate the different flavours - but that is a reflection on me rather than the beer. 
Plate is medium short - but again typical of the style. 
This was a gift of a six pack from a friend. Would certainly purchase myself, although Weihenstephaner is still my favourite in this style so far, this is a very nice beer.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","DavidAust"

Goldgelb, klar und mit einer zwar üppigen, aber schnell verflogenen Schaumkrone. Ein nur leicht hefig-säuerliches Aroma mit fruchtigem Einschlag. Der Antrunk ist sehr spritzig, ähnlich einem Sekt. Geschmacklich leicht hefig und bananig. Für ein Kristall sind die Aromen typischerweise eher zurückhaltend. Im Abgang wirds auch erwartungsgemäß trocken. Obwohl ich ein Hefeweizen stets bevorzugen würde, läßt sich dieses Kristallweizen schnörkellos gut trinken.

2648,"2003-05-29",2.0,"Large white foam and clear golden body. Aroma and taste-wise this beer does not have much to offer; seems like an uninteresting pilsner mixed with an average wheat beer. Boring but drinkable.","Skørping, DENMARK","Dalle"
2648,"2003-03-14",3.5,"Light golden with a taller white head.  Light bananas aroma.  Clean and uneventful, very much a kristall.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
2648,"2003-02-09",3.7,"Nice looking pale golden color with a medium short lasting head. Crisp and bitter, a great wheat beer. Must be chilled as it warmed the flavours became to skunky.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","LoveABeer"

Yet another pale yellow  healthy urine coloured beer with a medium cream coloured medium lasting head.  Hops and faint grassy meadows in the aroma. Medium body and palate with faint sweet, and stronger bitter flavours in the middle and refreshing clean bitter finish.

2648,"2002-04-07",3.1,"Not bad but not as good as hefeweizen. Found it a little more hoppier, but not as smooth as hefeweizen, without the same great head retention and with a hint of skunkiness.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","Octopussy"
2648,"2002-03-12",3.9,"Kristall golden colour with a tall rocky white head.  Pleasantly subdued banana aroam and crisp, clean wheat flavour with some slight fruitiness.  If I had to describe this beer in one word I would use subdued.  It has all the good charecteristics of a weizen, but nothing really makes too much of an impression.  A good well balanced, easy to drink session beer.","San Diego, California, USA","Kaya161"
