2006,"2017-05-29",3.3,"Color marrón, turbio, con capa de espuma de un blanco amarronado de cuatro o cinco dedos de grosor (grumosa, burbujas amplias, parece que no va a durar pero se mantiene durante largo rato). Excesivamente carbonatada, para mi gusto. En cuanto toca tu lengua parece que el líquido se convierte en burbujas y la experiencia de saborear no es tan placentera como podría haber sido. Aroma a pomelo, melocotón, piña, malta caramelizada (muy por debajo de lo demás). Sabor a melocotón, piña, cítricos, con base de malta caramelizada y tostada y reminiscencias a frutos secos y cacao. Final de amargor ligero. Postgusto casi inexistente, ligeramente tostado. Más IPA que Brown Ale. Cruce interesante pero a años luz de lo esperado (como concepto, bien; su realización... no tanto). Disfrutable pero no merece un top 50. Por alguna extraña razón si uno añade el último tercio de la botella (repleto de sedimento) todo se vuelve aún más turbio (estilo lodazal) y gran parte de esa carbonatación se pierde. Más fácil de beber pero sabor más rancio. No sé, no me convence del todo esta cerveza.","Oviedo, SPAIN","kaserov"
2006,"2017-05-23",4.0,"Copenhagen 24/5 2017. 50 cl on tap from Gaarden & Gaden. Pours slightly hazy copper brown with creamy off-white head, Settles as 1 cm thick layer of dense foam. Massive lacing. Aroma is quite citric and bitter with a solid whiff of exotic fruit. A little caramel just to remind me that this is a brown ale. Medium carbonation and medium thick palate. Flavor is lightly sweet followed by heavy bitterness. An orgy of grape fruit. Aftertaste is bitter with a solid dry finish. Not the typical brown ale - but a brutal citra bitter version of the Classic.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","DraftDodger"

Aroma af Citra humle og lidt ristet malt. Senere fremkommer lidt noter af frugt. 
Rødbrun og rolig ufiltreret Brown Ale med 1 cm moccafarvet skumtop med ganske store bobler, som svinder til et tæt skum. 
Ganske dejlig øl med langt mere bitter smag end i en almindelig Brown Ale. Så fans af almindelig BA: keep away! I smagsbilledet er en vis let sødlig frugtagtig smag, men i stormål tillige en solid bitterhed. Balancen imellem smagselementerne er fin og fungerer. 
Opsummering: let sødme, middel til solid bitterhed. 
Mellem fyldig krop med en karbonering på veltilpasset niveau, som jeg vil vurdere til et nyk under medium. Konsistensen er klæbrig. Eftersmagen er lækker bittersød og medium lang.

2006,"2015-06-15",3.4,"Deep brown pour with a thin foamy light khaki head. Nutty earthy cocoa aromas mix with burnt caramel, and some kind of american/west coast hop bitterness underneath. The flavor is a wild ride full of unexpected twists. Theres this almost sour ale oak-iness right at the start, then the earthy English nuttiness comes in with a dash of earthy chocolate, a sharp herbal/orange rind hoppy bitter twang, with a lasting sort of citric bitterness mixed with a semisweet earthy cocoa nuttiness...Its fine, but India Brown Ales are my least favorite hybrid style so my judgement is skewed. Its a fine beer if youre into it. Well made too. Just would have been better without the hops.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

2006,"2013-12-17",3.5,"In short: A somewhat fruity-hoppy dark roasted beer of some kind. Decent.
How: Bottle 500ml, consumed a few weeks after purchase after its long boat ride to North-America.
The look: Muddy brown body topped by a persistent small tan head.
In long: Nose is rich dark malts and moderately hoppy blending tropical fruits and nutty brownies. In mouth the beer feels rich, a creamy texture, a generous carbonation. Taste is creamy fudge, chocolaty and nutty, a certain roasted wood sensation, somewhat hoppy adding refreshing fruity flavors. More roasted than the average Brown Ale. Dry finish. A fun no-style bastard beer. Seems like Beer Here has two (or more) hoppy brown ales in their lineup, this Kama Citra was good but I much preferred their other hoppy brown ale Autumnic Fallout.

Not so big beige foam, but creamy and long-lasting; even if you sip, it remains and pervade your lips. Nice structured aroma of vanilla, coffee grounds, hay, a little bit of spices, hops; its wholeness gives sense of balance. Creamy body, light to medium, low carbonated but fizzy; like a Lindt chocolate tablet with orange added, but bitter and salty as well. Caramel and coffee again, leads to an intense floral, citric, grassy and bitter finish of hops. After two or three seconds it turns to something REALLY astringent, harsh and quite spicy or peppery that lasts long, long and *long* at palate as a squeeze of grapefruit juice.

(10 cl on tap, CBF 2011 as well as 50 cl bottle from Toft Vin) Pours a reddish brown with medium, toffee head that laces the glass.

Strong aroma of citra hops (glass is 30cm away and i can rate the aroma remotely) Aroma is bitterhoppy, citrussy, faint sweet malty. Very nice.
flavor is malty, dry from hops, slighlty grapefruity, palate is smooth. Flavor and aroma is so hoppy that if I had blind tasted this one i would likely have guessed on black ipa, double ipa or american strong ale. Way more hoppy than anything else ive had that claimed to be a brown ale. Be warned.

2006,"2011-03-20",3.9,"Bottle. hazy red brown color, almost no head. Aroma is reminiscent of a pale ale with a bunch of very fresh hops. Citrus and lots of lime. Very nicely balanced and with a complex hop/malt character. Taste is extremely fresh, lots of hops and a malt profile that hits the spot. Fresh citrus, lime, caramel, very dry, fresh carbonation. Also some grape. One of the best brown ales ive tried.","Aarhus, DENMARK","Jaksmart"

2006,"2011-02-27",3.7,"Flaske: Brun øl med et fint skumhoved. Duften er velhumlet og minder en del om det hedengangne Ølfabrikken India brown ale. Dejlig øl, men med lidt for meget citrus til at den kommer helt op og ringe. Det clasher meget lidt med den søde malt der ellers gør det til en umiskendelig brown ale. God.","Husum, DENMARK","Defreni"

Aroma of pineapple, grape, hint of peach and some mixed floral notes. Over the palate came caramel and light nutty notes with some light toasted malty feel as well. Medium bodied with an average carbonation and dry texture. Moderated bitter flavor with good counter sweetness making this beer quite balanced and very drinkable. Moderately dry and light bitter finish.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Grovlam"

Hard to find the brown ale in this one, it reminds me most of all of an IPA. Rated to style it wouldn´t do well, as it´s too much reminding of an IPA, but fine as an IPA.","Nibe, DENMARK","rane"

2006,"2011-02-10",3.9,"Bottle. Pours a dark ruby red/brown color with a frothy beige head. Aroma is super hoppy with loads of grapefruit and notes of topical fruits. You also get some faint caramelly notes, but the aroma is mostly hoppy. Flavor is again a hop monster with tons of grapefruit, some tropical fruit and peach. In the back end you get some faint toasted and caramelly malts. The body is medium with a powdery-dry mouthfeel. Overall a really good Indian Brown Ale, that would become more Brown Ale-like after some time, when the hops has settled down. But I prefer it this way.","Nørresundby, DENMARK","beerisgoodforu"

2006,"2011-01-29",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2014 Aroma of hops, citrus, resin and some dark nuances. Taste add some more tropical nuances and some more roastyness and sweets from the malts. Bitterness from the hops follows with citrus and there is also caramel in there. I like this interpretation of a brown ale!","Aarhus, DENMARK","RasmusOtt"
2006,"2011-01-28",3.8,"Pours murky brown with a small brown head. Aroma is packed with fresh citra hops, crispy caramel and nutty malts, citrus, kiwi, very fruity on top of the dark malts. The taste is at first insanely hoppy with the frsh citra hops that packs citrus, kiwi,  pine and grape. The malts are evident and on the sweet side, but are held in place by the up front hops. This hoppy brownn ale thing can easily go wrong, but this beer really takes it to the max. Really good.","Copenhagen (formerly Aalborg), DENMARK","phredrik"
