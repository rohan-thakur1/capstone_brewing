1429,"2017-04-26",3.2,"12 oz bottle part of Beer Camp just got at Finger lakes Beverage center Ithaca with a date on bottle of 4/6/14 (from the discount bin).

1429,"2016-06-18",3.5,"July 17th, 2014 - Next in the beer box is a collaboration with Victory, the Alt Route, an altbier (easy to guess from the name, I think) and a rare style here in San Diego. Im eager to try it by the time I dig in, noting the darker, auburn color and one finger of mostly white foam. The aroma is on the sweeter side, showing off some sweet cream, malt and caramel, like a lighter version of a red ale. It matches that style with smells of bubblegum and pomegranate too, though adding a twang that red ales dont typically have, and to which I might be attributing that pomegranate note. The palate is foamy on the front and then clears quickly, like fog in a sunbeam, revealing mild flavor of pomegranate. These make way for a more generic malt profile in the mid-taste and aftertaste, but with a lightness and crispness that gives the flavor some too to demand the tongues attention. I appreciate the light and crisp body, too, and should credit the hybridized style of brewing that Altbiers require for what is in effect both flavorful and refreshing.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1429,"2016-01-10",3.4,"12 oz bottle from 2014 Beer Camp series. Pours a burnt Amber color and topped by a small head of off white foam that fades quickly into the body below. The aroma shows notes of toasted bread malts, caramel, toffee, and light citrus fruit with some citrus hop bitterness on the back. The flavor follows and is mostly sweet from the caramel and toasted bread malts with some balancing citrus hop bitterness on the back end. Medium bodied with balanced carbonation that leads to a crisp, bitter lager finish. Decent enough but not my favorite style or of the series.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

This was poured into a stange.
The appearance was a slight hazy amber to bronzed brown color with a nice transparency about it. This has got to be one of the longest lasting heads Ive ever seen in any altbier as it lasts for a good two and a half minutes. Once it does die out, the lacing is quite speckled and clung nicely around the glass.
The smell had a grassy sweet toasted caramel aroma.
The taste mainly copied that with a smooth semi-crisp light caramel aftertaste that led to a dry finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. The carbonation sat just right for the altbier style and was good for me.

Aroma: Not a lot of aroma on this beer. It has a slightly spicy hop character and that is it.

Taste: This has a light caramel sweetness up front followed by a bread crust-like flavor which is ended by a mint flavored hop aftertaste. A bit of pine needle lingers around the edge as well. I can see where the interpretation of flavors would lend itself to an Altbier.

Overall: This was a decent beer but not that memorable. It was worth drinking and worked well as an Altbier, but it just felt like subtle nuance was missing from it.","","teromous"

A solid altbier is pretty true to the style. Despite that I find it to be a bit boring after about a half glass. Im not sure if a little age took the edge out of the hops but it lacked the spirit of a true Victory beer. Thankfully though it has enough redeeming characteristics to be average or slightly above average.

Aroma / Appearance - A fluid coppery base with white crisp head brighten the glass. Malt, red vines, caramel, and heavily malted iced tea hang in the air with a warm presence. A bit thicker than expected it is not a subtle altbier.

Flavor / Palate - The chewy mouthfeel tastes like biting into a fresh warm loaf of sourdough bread. A splash of nuttiness, caramel, and stale chocolate adds nice depth. The finish weakens the experience. With a bland touch the beer peters out rather than finishing strongly. I would not object to another bottle but this is one of the weaker offerings in the Beer Camp box.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1429,"2014-08-05",3.5,"Served on tap in a pint glass 

 Appearance  The beer is served a brown-amber color with a one finger head of tan colored foam. The head fades moderately quickly, leaving a bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell- The aroma is biggest of a slightly sweet and roasty smell with the sweet aromas being of toffee and brown sugar and the roasted being of a roasted malt smell mixed with some toasted bready smells. A little bit of a citrus and grassy hop are there as well, but these are quite light in comparison to the others.

 Taste  The taste begins with roasted malt flavor with some hints of a brown sugar and toffee. The sweeter flavors initially increase in intensity all while the roast remains relatively constant and is joined by some bready flavors. This soon changes however as the roasted flavors increase at the expense of some of the sweet with some more woody and slightly rummy flavors coming to the taste as well. A bit of a toast flavor as well as some lighter hop flavors of a more herbal and grassy taste come to the tongue along with a resurgence of some sweet flavors with a decent showing of brown sugar and caramel, which end up leaving a moderately sweet and more roasted bready flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body is a bit on the thicker side with a carbonation level that is on the slightly lower side. For the sweet and slightly more roasted flavors of the brew the feel is quite nice and accentuates these flavors well.

 Overall  A rather good alt. A nice level of roast that complements the sweet rather nicely and leaves one with just enough bitter from the hop to cleanse the palate a bit.","","Darkmagus82"
1429,"2014-08-05",3.4,"Bottle; Pour is deep mahogany with a modest, fine bubbled khaki head into this glass. It retains on the average side, with sticky lacing presence. The nose is toffee initial, moving to grassy hops, with light citrus notes moving forward. The silky smooth smoke / nuttiness barely sticks its head out. My first thought was that this was lacking the malt depth I was looking for, while the bright hop elements took over - but frankly the description tells the story well. The marketing on this particular brew is applause worthy - the naming, style, beer series, and creation are molded beautifully. Unfortunately its not as wonderful a success as a finished beer. Anyway - its vibrant from the hop presence - light citrusy sweet notes meld with mellow malty undertones - its bittering and a little dry, with more fruit and velvet near the finish line.

Malt aroma is sugary and beautiful, but with a certain Euro crispness. There is a certain hint of metallic/battery in the nose, but it enhances instead of detracting. The hop is a mild, grassy accent.

Flavor has sugary malts. There is a nutty dryness. There isnt a ton of hop -- what there is seems like the Euro/bittering variety. But the malt components (sweet sugars, nutty grains) balance each other enough.

Light bitterness (and slightly rubbery) but seems increased in the relatively dry environment. Faint fruitiness but a stronger effect on the tongue, sub-puckering and not tart, but ... curling. Some caramel and toffee, but minimal, no earth, but a hint of smoke or heavy roast. Just a touch of milky, lactose-dripping chocolate. Citrus also but its cast in a complementary role. Id like this is be a little more malt-forward, or at least show more separation between malt and hop bite, but as it is theres a bit of a muddle in the middle of the balance.

the nose was nice and the flavor was good but could have been better if there were less carbonation, it appeared to be fizzy at first but got a little better after the beer had warmed up a bit and the glass was swirled some to lessen the carbonation, I think the carbonation gave a bit of a carbo bite to the drink and added on to the hop bitterness, and it made the drink fizzy, I would have given this beer a better rating with less fizz.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

Appearance: The body is crystal clear with a mahogany body that has red tones through it. The head is tall and pillowy with a light tan hue. This fills out my glass nicely and looks great in it.
Aroma: The aroma is mild, but lovely. Hints of clean bitterness with a complex malt base giving caramel, cocoa and bready aromas. 
Taste: Holy shit was the first words out of my mouth. What a wonderfully lovely beer. The malt base is near thick and very prominent in flavor giving a rich caramel and cocoa base with a bready backing. Overlying that is a clean, slightly bitter orange, hop profile that perfectly balances out the body. The finish is dry, giving some rich malts before giving out. Lingering is a hint of cocoa, a hint of toast and a clean bitterness.
Palate: Crisp and moderately carbonated.
Overall: I dont have too much experience with altbiers, but from my understanding this is about as perfect as youre going to get. I absolutely love the balance of flavors here, the complexity of the malt base and the firm, yet restrained, hop profile. What a god damned good beer. I would buy the hell out of this if it were available.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Mouth is nutty malts, toast, raisins, tobacco, hoppy bitterness kicks in near mid-range and follows through the finish.

1429,"2014-07-26",4.1,"This is a nice, slightly Americanized take on a Sticke alt. In the glass, it is red brown w/ a small head of fine white bubbles. Its nose is hop forward, a real lemony noble hop thing going on, which is underpinned by Munich-type malts--very nice. Once tasted, the hops take on an almost American charcter, piny and even mildly resinous. The malts bring a touch of sweetness which lends a creaminess to this otherwise relatively light bodied beer. It finishes w/ firm bitterness and some lingering caramel sweetness. I really wish I could buy a six pack of this stuff. It is delicious, balanced and incredibly drinkable.

Aromas are toasty-malty, with moderate floral and toasty hop character, new-world noble varieties, herbal, mild dark fruit, oat-nut cereal, baked bread, warming malt without being sweet, clean fermentation. Flavors are toasted, almost a touch of smoke character forming, dark fruit, repressed esters, moderate herbal hop, alcohol forming, quite dry finish. Lower bodied, medium carbonation warming. Hard to get style done well. Lingering bitterness to combat the dry yet malty notes.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

1429,"2014-07-14",3.6,"12 ounce bottle. The aroma on this has a nice sweet toffee character along with a touch of caramel. Some herbal and floral hops back this up. Nice. Transparent gorgeous ruddy amber body with a strong, large, fizzy off-white head present. Starts with a little toffee sweetness and some toasted maltiness. Some caramel and melanoidins come through in the middle, which gives it a nice sticky character. Finishes with a large hop flavor and bitterness that is mostly grassy and herbal. Hoppier than expected, but this is Sierra Nevada, which has a long and storied history of hopping the shit out of everything.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

1429,"2014-07-13",3.6,"12 oz bottle from the variety pack. Aroma is grape bubblegum (odd!). Pours a clear deep copper penny hue with a one finger off-white head that falls after a minute or two; laces some. Taste is bittersweet with a lingering mostly bitter finish that plays off the sweetness; a little bready. Finely carbonated with a creamy mouthfeel. Yet another beer in this pack that seems well executed but a little boring (other than the weird aroma).","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
1429,"2014-07-13",3.2,"Bottle to snifter (shared with the Mrs.). Looks good for the style; a pretty transparent dark amberish brown with foamy light caramel head. Smells of lager yeast with notes of caramel, toast, and hops. A touch of grain too. Tastes like it smells, but with less hops and more grain. Solid, but forgettable.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"

1429,"2014-07-12",3.8,"Amber, good clarity. Bready sweet nose. Flavor is herbal/spicy noble hop flavor and some toasty/biscuity/bready sweetness.

1429,"2014-07-12",3.2,"Pours with a pretty thick head with a fairly auburnish hued body. Not much in the way of lacing or aroma (but its an Alt Bier so it isnt supposed to have to much). Pretty strong for an Alt. Possibly the biggest Alt Ive had. Not very sessionable and almost to hoppy for the style, comes across more like a Brown IPA to me than an Alt. Not bad overall, but not what I was hoping for. (Bottle from the Beer Camp mixer)","Washington, USA","jweiss"

1429,"2014-07-10",3.7,"This is in the German brown ale style. Not much aroma, but a nice balance between hops and malt.

>> Clear brown pour with large, pillowy tan foam. Good retention. Nose is fairly hoppy, fresh mint, licorice, dark bread crust, spiced bread. Soda like palate, thinner and dusty with high carbonation. Taste brings dark bread, bread crust, licorice, and mint. Bitter, spicy, hoppy. I guess this is what altbier is, a brown hoppy lager.
