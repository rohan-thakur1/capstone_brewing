202,"2017-02-18",4.3,"Draft sample at the source. The beer is a clear gold with a white head of foam. The aroma has big notes of tropical fruit, but still a strong herbal and bready character. The doughy notes of the beer are awesome. Like fresh milled grain. Medium body and moderate carbonation. The best beer of the visit.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
202,"2017-01-23",3.7,"Shelton Brothers pour. Tropical fruit nose with mango and pineapple shining with a touch of citrus. Grassy on the palate with some lemon, a touch of grain. Clean finish with a touch of bitterness. A fun new-world kolsch.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
202,"2016-11-21",3.6,"Draft at Owens Ordinary, 11/20/16.  
Clear gold, decent white head. Musky, fruity, and herbal. Bit grassy as well. Hot for the style. Clean and drinkable. Pretty good.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
202,"2016-11-20",3.5,"Draft at Owens Ordinary. WOW OMG 2ND RANKED KOLSCH IN THE WORLD!!!! AAAAAHHH never mind just remembered kolsches are sort of boring, but good tick nonetheless. Hazy yellow straw color with a huge billowing white head. Aroma is tropical fruit and floral notes, passion fruit, mango, pineapple. Nice flavor, balanced, hoppy, rustic. Medium-light on the feelz, lively. Great for a loofah (WTF phone keeps autocorrecting LILACS ugh KOLSCH to loofah and lilacs and such). But not that true to style, so sort of cheating.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
202,"2016-11-17",4.0,"appearance: hazy, very light gold, big frothy white head.  aroma: big nose full of freshly-zested lemon, freshly-harvested herb garden, and toasty white bread.  taste: 	toast, cracker, pepper, strong herbal and citrus hop notes, with candied lemon peel and fresh grass.  finish: dry, slight bite to the palate, a little pepper and yeasty spice that almost feels like a witbier; zippy, refreshing palate. notes: Kolsch-cum-witbier with aggressive-for-style American hopping. Best beer I tried on the night.  Draft at Owen?s Ordinary.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"
202,"2016-05-17",3.9,"I like this one both because the base is a nice crisp kolsch, and of course that its nicely Galaxy hopped, making it not so much a classic kolsch, but a very nice dry fruit forward crushable beer.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
202,"2016-03-17",3.1,"From draft at the brewery. Its a one-dimensional lemon-focused hoppy golden ale with little malt character, whatever is there is overwhelmed by the raw pellet bitterness, the effect in the mouth is bitter and pointed and parched.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
202,"2016-02-23",3.0,"On tap at Bluejacket. Not feeling the love thats been dished out for this. Lacking the crisp bite and frothy, lively nature of the original. Soft, grainy aroma and taste, dry finish, but could use a little ""pop"".","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"
202,"2016-01-11",4.0,"750 mL bottle. Clear yellow. Big white head. Smells tropical. Light grain. Taste is equally tropical. Really nice hop flavor. Masks everything else. Faint grain flavor behind it. Light body. Pretty crisp. Low bitterness. Its really hardly a Kolsch, but thats ok. I was looking for a little more bitterness and maltiness. Maybe I just cant taste it because of the dry-hopping.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
202,"2016-01-01",4.6,"Is it true to style? Not really. This is basically an IPA with how post-2009 varietal hoppy it is, but it smells great, tastes great, and drinks great, so its a great beer regardless of what you call it.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
202,"2015-11-29",4.2,"Light straw color. Aroma is strong peach. Maybe some hay. Taste is also strong peach, a bit hoppy. A distinctive and tasty beer.","Virginia, USA","OnTheTrail"

202,"2015-07-17",3.9,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a hazed gold with a thin to medium sized white head. Soft musky grain on the nose with some dusty melon and hops. Medium bodied, light sweet grain, musk and melon, definitely has that Galaxy hop flavor coming through nicely.

202,"2015-06-13",4.0,"Pale slightly hazy pour. The nose is really bright and floral. Some
lemony citrus as well. Noble hops, grass and hay with just a perfectly
balanced bitterness. Flinty dryness. Damn. Perfect after a long walk.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
202,"2015-05-04",4.0,"Draft. Pours gold with a white head. Clean malt profile, with pale and light bready notes, mild bitterness, and fruity melon-like hoppy notes. This is awesome. Obviously too much of a hop profile to be considered a true-to-style kolsch, but who cares. Balanced and immensely drinkable.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
202,"2015-05-02",3.1,"On tap at American Oddessey Relay finish party in DC waterfront. Clear golden with light head and not overly hoppy. Some juniper notes with a bright, clean finish.","Pennsylvania, USA","iggynelix"
202,"2015-04-23",3.7,"Sampled at Schlafly Repeal of Prohibition Fest 2015 - Pours clearish yellow with a white head. The aroma has pleasant fruity hops, pale malt, spice and stone fruit. It has a medium / light body and very crisp carbonation. The flavor start with the aroma traits along with crackers, pine and hop forward. The finish is pleasantly bitter. Much hoppier than normal, but very delicious.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
202,"2015-04-13",2.8,"Seriously? How is this beer getting such high ratings?! Tasted on tap in a mini Willybecher glass at the 2015 Schlafly Repeal of Prohibition Festival. It poured a hazy golden colour with weak white foam. I like the idea of a dry-hopped Kolsch in the abstract, but I guess for me Kolsch is all about that difficult and delicate balancing act between crisp graininess, peppery and perfumey noble hops, and ever-so-subtle top-fermented German ale yeast esters. Therefore, once you overwhelm everything with huge juicy-fruity Galaxy hops, the entire Cologne-style concept is obliterated. This was an okay hops-forward golden ale, light and citrusy, rough around the edges, not great.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"
202,"2015-04-11",3.9,"Sampled at Repeal. Hazed white gold. I love the fruity floral aroma. Beautiful hop aroma. The flavor is hop forward, too, and shows off the hops nicely. Honey suckle and soft maltiness. This is good. Two for two from these guys.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"

202,"2015-02-14",4.0,"Tap at Bluejacket. Zesty bright new school hop tones. Kind of unfair to call this one a Kolsch. Interesting creamy yellow body. Fresh, World Class beer.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
202,"2015-02-03",3.4,"On draft at Bluejacket in Navy Yard, DC. Poured on tap into a snifter. Appearance is watery pale body and lemon yellow color and cloudy. Aroma is huge notes of pineapple and tropical juice. Lots of hops. Huge amounts of club soda carbonation, giving a real papery crispness. Very aggressive though. Not my favorite style or beer. But decent.","Maryland, USA","BierMeHoos"
202,"2014-12-01",3.8,"For Local trade from Prufrockstar.
Appearance was hazy muddy yellow with lasting white creamy 1 finger head, rings of lacing. 
Aromas are fruits galore like, peach, guava, gooseberry with slight pine and apricot. 
Taste are soft sweet cracker malts upfront gives way to minerals, soft orange, mango, apricot and peach. Then slightly dryish lager finish.
Palate was soft smooth CO2 with light body, then average length fruity, soft dry finish.
Overall a solid session, sorry fruity Kolsch. Not traditional at all.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","Wittales"
202,"2014-11-23",3.9,"On tap @ The Festival 2014. Lightly hazed yellow straw pour with white foam. Theres a super fruity and tropical aroma to this. A whole lot of pineapple and mango. Some lemon peels, melon, and grass. Sort of a rice cracker and bready malt flavor. Juicy pineapple hops and some melon notes. Maybe a light sweetness of preserved lemon. Not sure how much of a Kolsch this is, but it drinks pretty good.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
202,"2014-10-29",3.9,"Bouteille 75cl courtesy of Travlr, split with Tomaz.
Huge content under pressure.
Dorée, trouble sur la fin, col très dense et actif.
Arôme offre un bouquet excellent fruité tropical venant du Galaxy, note abricot fermenté, citron vert et fruit de la passion.
Palais est fruité, je note pas mal de notes vertes rappelant un citronné vert frais, haute effervescence, le tout est sec sur un malté pils, et une possible rondeur de Vienna? Herbacé avec une pointe de fruit de la passion. Sur la fin la présence de lie se fait nettement plus ressentir ajoutant une certaine épaisseur à une bière si légère. Seul bémol de cette bière est que les derniers 25-30 cl sont trop sous linfluence dune levure trop épaisse.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
202,"2014-09-28",4.2,"On tap. This is a style buster and I dig it. Opaque straw color with a small spot of bubbles. Big nose of fresh grapefruit with the peppery zest, and some evergreen resin. Just a spot of honey. Tastes of grapefruit, peach, mango, resin and dank herb. Again a spot of honey and caramel to just balance. More to the light side and definitely a dry bias. Mid-carbonation is nice. This is more akin to a great SIPA, but who cares.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"

Wow.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
202,"2014-03-29",3.5,"Very well done for style. Dry hops gives it a good kick, and unlike many kolsxhs this actually tastes like they meant to make a kolsch instead of ending up with one by accident.

[ Tap ][ Bluejacket ][ 16oz ][ Flute ][ Free ][ 2/13/14 ]
>> Rating #7400. Holy, beautiful pour with gorgeous white foam, tremendous lace, low haze straw glow in color. Beautiful, bright galaxy hop nose with buttery fresh biscuit and orange marmalade, flashes of Sunny D/Five Alive. Super crisp pilsner like body with hints of sweet cream biscuit, light butter, orange marmalade, Sunny D/Five Alive. Grassy, clean bitterness. Quenching, ultra session. Maybe just a tad too much sunny D five alive character. Still, no one makes a good Kolsch so this is the first good one Ive tried. Cheers :)","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
