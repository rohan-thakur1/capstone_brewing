1478,"2015-05-15",4.3,"Rich coffee nose, robust and earthy. Brown, thin tan head. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, rich. Medium body, blood-like viscosity, soft carbonation. Sweet and delicious. Wonderful!","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
1478,"2015-05-08",4.7,"Draft... Pours dark brown (bordering on black) with a small, creamy, khaki cap that slowly dissipates. The aroma is a decadent swirl of fudge, espresso-roast coffee, acrid, earthy coffee and toasted pistachios. Ultra full-bodied with a plush mouthfeel and modest carbonation. The flavor is a hearty marriage of bittersweet dark chocolate and carbonic, dark-roast Columbian and Honduran coffees. Also, a touch boozy with a kiss of vanilla. Bittersweet, warming, black mocha finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1478,"2014-07-18",4.2,"Poured dark black with aromas of chocolate, coffee, grounds, earth, light roast and some cream. Flavors are the same, creamy on the palate, drinkable and abv hidden nicely. Really enjoyed this coffee porter from CCB.","Florida, USA","burg326"

1478,"2014-05-17",4.0,"32oz flip-top received a couple weeks ago in trade... Shared tonight with the inner circle... Pours a thick dark brown verging on black... the head is dark brown and sticks around for quite some time. Nose is hefty sweet dark mart combined with fantastic coffee that never verges on astringent.. Flavor mirrors the nose with a big sorta sweet component that I wasnt really expecting .. lactose?? Again there is plenty of coffee that moves in waves... This would be the beer that I want when camping at 6:00 am... Cold coffee beer while making the ""hot"" coffee. Pretty amazing.","Boise, Idaho, USA","JohnGalt1"

1478,"2014-05-09",3.8,"On tap at the brewery. Comes black with a nice brown head. Aroma of coffee and chocolate. Taste is coffee, milk chocolate, and some caramel. Not too sweet at all. A must for coffee lovers.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
1478,"2014-05-05",4.5,"On draft (snifter) in the Tasting Room.

Jet black and fairly viscous. Not quite motor oil when poured, but very close. Small head to it and you can immediately smell the sugary, coffee aroma (much like you get from the Cafe Con Leche).

The first sip of this immediately made me want some hot buttered cuban toast or something to go with it. It had an amazing coffee taste with a high amount of sugar. It might even be a little *too* sweet, but it just helps to balance out that dark, roasted coffee acidity.

This might just be one of my new CCB favorites. I really wish I had caught this on growler when they offered it a few weeks back and I hope that they bottle it, or even possibly do a BA version of it for the El Catador Club v2.","Florida, USA","Sumo813"
1478,"2014-05-03",3.8,"Draft - Dark roast coffee with a nice sweetness. Jet black with a rich brown head. Dark roast coffee and a huge amount of sweetness, that lingers in the finish. Much top sweet for me.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
1478,"2014-04-28",4.1,"Draft on tap at DLD 2014 (Munster, IN). I literally got the last whole pour from the keg at the guest tent later in the day. Pours a rich deep roasty blackish hue, opaque and dark with a brownish glow on the edges. Decent darker brown head atop stays as a loose ring, sticks around small and laces small overall. Aromas are rich and decadent espresso, coffee grounds and cocoa nibs. Touches of caramel, toffee, rich and quality coffee elements really take the reigns. Initial is firmer end of medium bodied, not too big with potent coffee flavors. Espresso, cocoa nib, roast and earth meets a gentle nuttiness, faint spice and creaminess into the middle. Touches of toffee, dark fruit, earth and chocolate are rich and flavorful into the backend. Some acidic roast, earth and rich coffee still washes over the palate in waves. Where this beer really wins for me is its smaller body, not just a sweet mess and thick/cloying. Its quite approachable and goes down far too easy. Finish is roasty, firm coffee and espresso, touches of earth. Really quality stuff. Best new beer I tried on the day.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
1478,"2014-04-12",4.5,"On tap in Vero Beach. I was not familiar with this beer and the first taste really took me by surprise! It pours a deep, rich black with almost no head and no lacing. The nose is a little subdued, revealing a hint of coffee and chocolate. The taste is absolutely fantastic, exposing rich coffee, milk chocolate and loads of dark fruit. This beer is special.","Valrico, Florida, USA","RLiddell"
1478,"2014-04-07",4.5,"Pours black and thick, wih a head that recedes, but still hangs on the edge of the glass to the bitter end. I love that.

High point of this beer is the aroma. A rich coffee aroma better than most coffee. It reminds me of my first Founders Breakfast Stout.

Taste is a rich, sweet coffee, perfectly blended to give a tangy punch.

Coffee beer fans must try this.","Rockford, Michigan, USA","jcvonrosen"

1478,"2014-04-06",4.2,"Black pour, creamy tan head. Nose is high quality coffee, chocolate, espresso. Taste is iced latte, cafe con leche, stevia, milk chocolate. A touch saccharine. Palate is medium-full, sticky and coats the mouth. Pretty much a perfect mouthfeel for the style.","","knickskicks"
1478,"2014-04-06",3.3,"This style is in my wheelhouse, but I was a little disappointed. Looks great, has a perfect mouthfeel and the finish is smooth for an imperial porter, but where is the coffee. I feel like it was wiped out by the extra abv. Good beer but not quite named correctly. I was expecting something like a richer cubano expresso, or a thicker cycle cream and sugar.","Florida, USA","lapalou"
1478,"2014-04-05",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2014 On tap. Pours black. Smells of chocolate, coffee, and boost. Taste is smooth, coffee, yummy, more. I like it.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","beechner224"
1478,"2014-04-05",4.2,"Draft. Holy hell this is great. Nose is full of a smooth roasted coffe with dark chocolate and cream. Taste is decadent rich dark chocolate. Like dessert in a glass. A touch sweet but damn this is good.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
1478,"2014-04-05",4.8,"On draft at Cigar City. Pours a nice obsidian color with a tan head. Nose is big coffee, lactose, some light roast, some cocoa, chocolate, and sweet earthy notes with cookie and sweet treats. Flavor starts out with earthy coffee, going to a cafe con leche with hints of cookie, chocolate, and cocoa, finishing with sweet chocolate, cafe con leche, and some earthy undertones. Light to medium in body and freaking delicious. Really loved this beer.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
1478,"2014-04-04",4.0,"Dark black with huge coffee spilling out. Dark roast espresso style. Taste is bubbly with chocolate, smooth intense coffee, and tobacco flavors. Really well done.","Florida, USA","Weezel"
