938,"2012-04-16",3.6,"Thanks a lot to phishpond! Bottle. A rich copper colored brew with a light khaki head. The nose is grainy with hints of both lettuce and caramel. There is also some nutty peanut. The taste is rich sweet peanuts and toffee. There is also a hint of roast to help balance and make more interesting. There is a hint of citrus and booze. Well done.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
938,"2012-02-22",3.2,"Draft at Old Fashioned.  Filtered burgundy brown.  Thin, glass lacing head.  An interesting experiment.  Honey fruit, sugared.  Malty, but dominated by the tweaked out yeast.  Soapy hop balance, but once again the odd, out of control yeast dominates.  Sort of a mess.  OK though..","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

938,"2011-08-23",3.9,"Bottled.  Poured a healthy shade of medium amber with a tall, dense beige head.. looked great in the glass!  The aroma picked up bread and nutty notes with accents of honey and dark fruit.. airy berries surrounded.. I really enjoyed it.  The flavor found more of the fruit and berries at the core, paired with nutty and biscuity support.. light earth and berry skin bitterness surrounded.. finished with great balance between the components.  Light-medium bodied with rolling carbonation through the palate.. very good feel and flow.. this caught me totally off guard!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Its a California common so if you buy this expecting some rich and complex beer you will be greatly disappointed. If you find yourself wanting a solid session beer from a regional brewery which sells only in a limited market then prepare to be a happy customer. This is the sort of thing Id stock in the fridge for warm summer afternoons when it was too hot for big stouts and I was not in the mood for an IPA.

Aroma / Appearance - The translucent body was the color of rusty tap water. Tufts of bubbly head sprang to life as it settled. Sweet dark fruit and malt are a mixture of generic cola and Sprite (poured 50/50). Easy on the senses this soft nose draws you in over time.

Flavor / Palate - The malt, light hops, and flat cola sooth the palate. Wth a mellow bitterness that does not wear down the senses it provides just enough flavor to remain interesting to the end of the bottle. Unlike other lawnmower beers though it doesnt leave you hanging at the end. Congratulations to Lake Louie for another local winner.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
938,"2011-08-17",3.2,"This beer is really pretty decent, but still nothing much to it.  I like some more complexity.","Hudson, Wisconsin, USA","DasBierChef"
938,"2011-08-08",3.5,"12oz bottle from Discount Liquor Milwaukee. Pours a light brown color with an off-white head. Aroma nutty, caramel.  Medium on the palate with average carbonation.  Flavor is sweet, nutty, caramel, with a dry, bitter finish.  Interesting.  Darker than I would expect for a steam beer, but pretty tasty.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"
938,"2011-08-07",2.7,"On tap at the Sugar Maple in Milwaukee.  Slightly cloudy brownish in color with a one finger light beige head.  Caramel aroma with some earthiness and wet leaves, maybe a bit of diacetyl.  Butter comes out on the flavor a bit more, but besides that the beer is not bad, with caramel malt, earth, and herbal/leafy notes.  Medium-bodied with semi-sluggish carbonation, which I sort of expect from this style.  Overall Id score this one about average.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
938,"2011-08-04",3.7,"Bottle pours copper with an off-white head. Aroma of toasted malt, nuts, and floral/earthy hops. Flavor shows pretty much the same with additional notes of milk chocolate. Overall body is moderate and creamy with a light sweetness and lightly bitter finish. A pretty straightforward brew but it is extremely well made. This is probably my favorite offering from LL so far.","Portland, Oregon, USA","dionysus"
938,"2011-07-29",3.8,"Pours a reddish amber into the glass with a smallish creamy tan head, mostly lasting. Malty on the nose.

938,"2011-07-14",3.8,"Nice to see Tom Porter introducing a new beer after five years. Sampled on draught during the 2011 Wisconsin Craft Brewers Festival in Chilton, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-clear dark copper colored brew with a thick and creamy off-white head that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some nice lacing. Aroma of toasted caramel malt, some fruity mild hop character and some roasted nuts. Taste is quite smooth, some toasted caramel malt floral hops and a touch of toffee. Finish is semi-sweet with a hint of chocolate, toffee with a mild bitterness. A surprisingly excellent common.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
938,"2011-07-07",3.8,"Bottle Clear, dark amber lager with a large, pillowy, off-white head. Fantastic retention. The bouquet is toasty, bready, nutty and doughy. Full-bodied with busy carbonation. The flavor is malty, nutty, toasty and doughy as well, but carefully balanced by earthy hops. Finishes bittersweet with a malty afterthought. The best California common Ive ever come across.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

938,"2011-06-07",3.6,"12oz bottle from Steves Liquor and More in Madison, WI. Pours a clear, deeper amber colored body with a red-orange tint. Finger-width, frothy, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is malty sweet with a good amount of grains and nuts. A bit bready and doughy, a touch of fruit, and a very light earthy hop. Flavor is sweetly malted, grainy, bready, and a tad bit toasty up front with a more distinct, nice level of earthy hopping throughout. Nutty with some caramel coming out at the end along with a faint fruitiness. Finishes clean, smooth, somewhat dry, and lightly bitter with the earthiness growing slightly in the aftertaste. Very soft, medium body and carbonation. Overall, a really nice Common. Smooth, soft, and well balanced with a pleasant earthiness to balance the sweet, grainy malts. Well done.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
938,"2011-05-21",3.5,"12 oz. bottle brought down from Madison by my aunt-in-law. Pours a clear, deep amber with a finger-thick off-white head. Aroma of nuts, a variety of malts- sweet, grainy, and toasty- with some faint earthy hops and dough. Flavor is also nutty and malty, with the malts sweeter (caramel and chocolate) than in the nose. Light-medium bodied, with medium carbonation and a dry, malty mouthfeel. Seems to really hit the style right on the nose. I prefer this to a lot of other steam ales/commons.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
938,"2011-05-09",3.7,"Bottle - The first new beer from Lake Louie in forever--yay! Pours clear mahogany with a small off-white head. Aroma of lightly sweet, slightly sour malt. Yum. Real bready and yeasty, with herbal hopping and a touch of caramel. Taste is nutty malt, light grassy hops, dark chocolate, a hint of dark coffee beans, and just a touch of alcohol. Smooth, well-carbonated, and very well-balanced. Im not a fan of all of Lake Louies stuff, but I like this one.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
