461,"2012-08-16",4.3,"On tap, 10oz pour,  - 3 floyds night at Taphouse Grill Westmont IL.  Completly opaque dark black.  1 finger of a frothy tan head.  Aroma dominated by coffee.  First sip hits you with a strong coffee note.  Like chilled espresso.  slight notes of chocolate and roasted malt follow.  Beer has a fantastic mouth feel for a lower ABV stout.  Very thick, almost a milky consistency, more commonly found in a stronger stout.  The beer is completly domnated by the coffee, and I think it is fantastic.  One of the better beers I have had, think Breakfast stout with the coffee turned up to 11.  I wish FFF would put this in their bottle rotation.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"

A: Black with slightly less than a finger of beige head that leaves a bit of lacing in its wake.

S: Huge coffee aroma, followed by roasted malt. Very nice.

T: Not surprisingly, a bold, coffee flavor. This beer tastes fabulous. The coffee is fresh and succulent, with none of the astringency or bitterness one sometimes finds in coffee or beers brewed with it. The roasted malt and oatmeal components are largely overshadowed by the dominating coffee, yet though they play a backing role, they are tasty nonetheless.

M: Medium to thin bodied with moderately low carbonation. Smooth on the palate, with coffee presence all along the way.

D: O ya, I would drink this again. FFF strikes yet again with another terrific beer.

The aroma was impressive, with roasty espresso, backed up by bakers chocolate notes, and some smoothness to the malt to temper the burnt hints. The flavor added a lingering, moderate hop bitterness that was burnt, dry, and somewhat astringent. With oatmeal, I expected a little creaminess to the palate, but with the soft carbonation and perceived low malt content, I got a sense of wateriness to the texture that detracted from any fullness in the body.

Pours black with a slight tan head and a bit of lacing as it goes down plus a fairly-wide collar as the head falls down. The nose is really strong black coffee plus a bit of roast. Really, really strong coffee. Not too much else there but the coffee is really nice and doesnt need anything else to back it up. The taste is quite similar--roasted malt is certainly there as well as some strong, black, high-quality coffee. Really enjoying this. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would like it, though the coffee comes through with a nice bitter, roasted feel. Good carbonation levels and goes down quite easily--had quite a bit of this without thinking about it. Huge fan of this though it doesnt quite compare to the Bullfrog Double Coffee, which is the brew I hold every coffee-infused beer up against. Still, one of the better coffee beers that Ive had in a long time. Thanks again, Alex.

461,"2010-11-04",3.7,"Three floyds helps black intelligencer. Tap served in a coffee mug at  
Fff... Pours a solid black pour with softer reddish brown edges and a  
creamy milky light khaki head... Aroma of earthy coffe beans without a  
huge amount of roast. Touch of backing vanilla... Soft, light, and  
fluffy in the mouth with a medium degree if coffee notes accentuated  
with the creamy, if a little too light, body of a smaller stout. Semi- 
sweet chocolate through the middle with a turn towards a coffee  
bitterness rounding things off. Light and drinkable.

461,"2010-11-02",3.7,"Draft at the brewpub (Munster, IN). Pours a pitchblack opaque pour, dark black with ominous darkness, a decent frothy brownish hot chocolate hued head, decent sized, frothy. Aromas are straight intellgentsia coffee, telltale roast and rich hued coffee, cocoa, roast. Touches of dark chocolate, roasted barley, some light sweetness. Big coffee bomb. Initial is big roasty coffee, bitter and smoky, touches of cocoa, more roast, raw coffee grounds. Medium bodied, maybe a touch lighter, with big roast, a touch of cocoa and caramel, toffee, faint hopping with a more bitterness and roasty malts clinging to the palate. This really is a coffee bomb, big roast and telltale intelligentsia, roasty with some espresso, flavorful, coffee grounds. A nice coffee beer here","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Dark black beer with dark brown head.  Aroma is black coffee beans.  The flavor is similar to drinking a pot of black coffee.  Dark roasted malts show up as well.  Similar to Breatkfast Stout.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Bigmmartin"
461,"2010-10-31",3.7,"Tap: Pours basically pitch black with some lace and lasting frothy beige head. The aroma is espresso and milk chocolate with a note of roast and char. Some prune and molasses esters. Grassy herbal hops around the edges. The taste is very coffee forward with a nice bitterness to balance the sweeter malt. Plenty of charred astrengent character towards the finish with a bit of dark fruits and lacto sourness for additional complexity. The mouth feel is sprite and refreshing, a tad thin which is often the case with most coffee stouts. Overall a fine effort and one I would drink again. Would love to see this bottled in 12 oz servings to replace my purchasing of Bells Java Stout which has gone downhill over the past few years.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
461,"2010-10-30",4.0,"Growler.  Aroma is coffee.  Notes of coffee and vanilla.  Coffee, coffee, coffee, and more coffee.  Palate is light and dry.  Flavor brings out coffee and it finishes dry leaving a coffee aftertaste.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AndyReynolds"
461,"2010-10-29",3.7,"On tap at FFF. Poured near black with a grayish brown head that dissipated to the edges. Aroma was full of dark grain with a nice strong coffee note and a bit of an backing oat note. Flavor had oat in the beginning, but quickly dark grains and strong coffee took over and grew throughout the finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
461,"2010-10-27",4.1,"Draft at brewpub.  Resembles and smells like a cold cup of good quality coffee.  For a regular stout, this beer is impressive on taste and palate with a big coffee flavor that is mellowed nicely by the sweetness of the malt.  Very flavorful and drinkable.","Alaska, USA","12many"
461,"2010-10-25",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2010 Rating 1600.  Tap at fff.  Served in a coffee mug.  Nice frothy tan head.  Aroma of awesome roasty, dark, chocolatey coffee and cream.  Silky smooth 75 percent cocoa chocolate, and bitter roasty coffe flavor.  Just a supurb coffee beer.  Everything about this beers mellows together wonderfully, with the coffee, roast, bitterness, and chocolate, and milk all playing a big role, but nothing dominates.  Leaves some awesome lacework on the glass.  A bit of a green, pine, grassyness come to fruition, adding a layer of complexity.  Overall, quite the quaffable and tasty coffee stout.  Makes me happy I brought back some intelligensia coffee from chicago.  Tight beer.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
461,"2010-10-23",3.9,"On tap at FFF - pitch black pour with a modest beige head. Huge coffee bean aromas - mission accomplished! Mouthfeel is a little lighter than i hoped (reminds me of rogue brews), but either way - big coffee bean flavors, oatmeal, bitterness not unlike coffee (black). Winner.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
461,"2010-10-21",4.0,"6%  ABV  but  dont  let  it  fool  you  because  this  one  is  malty  and  rich  of bold  flavors. Medium  to  full  bodied. Great  strong  coffee  flavors  and  aroma. Very  roasty  with  some  hints of chocolate. Great  coffee  stout  with  a nice  texture  feel  from  the oatmeal.","Stoutville, Illinois, USA","StoutFest"
