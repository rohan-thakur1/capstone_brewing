4162,"2011-05-14",3.5,"On tap at Rowlands Calumet Brewery.  The best of the brews I had on my visit but seems more like a porter than a dunkler bock.  Clear ruby red with a thin taupe topper.  Aroma of roasted malt, caramel, dark malts and brown sugar.  Taste of dark roasted malt, chocolate, coffee with mild bitterness on the finish.","Oak Creek, Wisconsin, USA","esjaygee"
4162,"2010-08-30",3.2,"On tap at the brewery, pours a clear dark red with no much of a head.  Taste is sweet, with notes of orange and cinnamon.  Pretty good offering.","Annandale, Virginia, USA","Scubatrip"
4162,"2008-08-19",3.2,"This beer pours a dark black colour, full nutty light brown head. Roasted malts in the aroma as well a little toffee. Taste is dark, bold and rich with burned coffee grounds and dark chocolate. A fairly decent bock, lighter then what i would expect and very smooth.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","phishpond417"
4162,"2007-05-01",3.7,"Thanks to skyview for sharing.  Sweet biscuit nose with a dark brown body.  Sweet malty body with a faintly bourbon biscuit character.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
4162,"2007-04-28",3.6,"My thanks to Skyview for sharing.  Malty like a bock should be.  Some caramel, sugar.  It is definitely bocky overall, with all of the standard qualities. Very good, but it cant compete with the best doppelbocks.  Sweet, smooth finish.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
4162,"2007-04-17",4.1,"Fourth stop during Wisconsin Trip #2 and one of 11 brews offered at this small town brewpub. Pours a very dark brown brew with a near white thick head. In light background there are some mahogany red highlights. Aroma picks up smoky toasted barley malts with scents of chocolate, nuts, and llight coffee. Taste is smooth with roasted and bitter malts in this medium body bock and a creamy finish.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
4162,"2006-05-02",3.4,"pours dark brown with a small head. a bit of something floral with the sweet nose.  woody and smokey flavor with a lingering roast sweetness. a bit metallic in the finish but an enjoyable brew none the less.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
4162,"2005-07-28",4.3,"On tap at brewery.  As Bob says this is as dark a coal miners rear.  Pours a swirly brown and whitish head...all of Bobs beers seem to have a true creamy  head.  Fragrant, but not that typical sweet malt aroma.  Full bodied, welll balanced, with that distinctive spice that sets these beers apart.  I disagee that this beer is of a dessert quality.  I found it inviting, complex and very unique.  With anise, black pepper, and cardamom.  Great even on a hot day in July.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","jewedekind"
4162,"2005-06-26",3.6,"Deep chocolate brown with scarlet hues when held up to the light.  Smells of sawdust, chocolate malt Whoppers, Hershey syrup and hay.  Flavor is rich and sweet, with a touch of astringency as it slips from the center of the tongue.  Some aspects remind me of a key lime cheesecake I had with chocolate icing dripped over it.  The lime aspects account for the slight acidic lick on the sides of the tongue.  Palate is a little thin but not distracting.  Syrupy cola finish.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
4162,"2005-06-22",3.3,"Tap at the American Club.  Dark ruby color with offwhite head.  Smells of chocolate, light roast, and caramel malt.  Mildly hoppy.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"
4162,"2005-05-22",4.0,"Dark Brown Coloring with Sandy Head.  Smokey Aroma.  Rich Malt, Nutty Notes..Dry Ending.  Very Nice Brew.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
4162,"2005-05-22",3.7,"Dark dark amber color. Starts light, picks up a perfumey caramel  Great balance and a great bock.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
4162,"2005-05-19",3.2,"Poured from growler, courtesy of cquiroga at OBriens.  My notes have this titled as ""Calumet alleged Bock"", because as DarkElf mentions just below, we were somewhat baffeled by the seeming inconsistency of the experience of this beer to our past Bock reference points.  However, it poured dark brown and clear with brick red highlights and a tannish head.  Aroma is of dark smokey malts - nice and roasty - with notes of chocolate and coffee.   Mild flavors, roasty, bitter maltiness, woody, tannic and astringent in the finish.  Medium body and creamy carbonation.  For a bock I would have expected much more aroma, flavor and palate.","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"
4162,"2005-05-03",3.3,"(Growler: Shared by cquiroga at OBriens) There was a great deal of discussion at the Ratebeer table whether this was even the right beer.  Tastes like no bock Ive ever sampled.  Tastes like a dark brown lager to me, not a bock.  Moderately roasty, dry, somewhat bitter in the finish.  Fairly simple, and lacks the sweetness or the moderate alcohol I associate with more traditional bocks.  The nose is lightly roasty, dry, earthy and lagerish.  Dark brown color is slightly translucent.  Light tan head is smallish, which might be expected from a two week old growler, and the head fades to a small island surrounded by a circular coral reef.  Its a decent beer, certainly quite drinkable and enjoyable, but nothing here is terribly interesting or extraordinary.  But this is the main reason why I dont trade growlers.  I just dont think beer travels well in growlers, and if what others say about this beer is true, this one seems to have lost a bit in transit.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
4162,"2005-04-30",4.1,"Growler from Hezron; many thanks!  Very dark brown color (just a pinch under black!) with no head.  Woody aroma.  The taste is more like an alt: smokey and nutty with a good burst of malt and a dry finish.  Tasty fine!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
4162,"2005-04-22",3.3,"4/21/05.  Poured out of growler, obtained in trade with hezron on RateBeer 4/15/05.  Damn.  What a disappointment.  I feel a little uncertain even about rating this beer, because my experience with it was so far off from what earlier ratings had indicated, I almost thought it was the wrong beer.  Or it had just gone bad.  But while Im sure the beer was worse for the wear of taking a cross-country journey in a growler, it did not have any strong signs of spoilage.  And so I rate.  The carbonation was actually very nice, but it seemed like the flavors were ""soaked"" a little.  Dark brown, mostly transparent with a red-brown tinge.  Decent, light tan and mostly creamy head that hangs around awhile.  Light smokey and nutty aroma, gentle roast with lagery hop and very faint caramel malt.  A touch of wet hair in the aroma-- the main indicator that this probably *was* past its prime.  Not very bock-like.  Dry finish with soft fluffy mouthfeel, very faint chocolate with a long, drying trail and gentle bitterness.  Not much going on of interest-- not much bock-y sweetness.  Really disappointing in its ordinariness.  The mouthfeel is really good-- the best thing about this beer, but it cant save the disappointing flavor or aroma.  Eminently drinkable, but I dont feel like I should bother.  The beer seems off.  Again, not badly spoiled, but like it lost its character at the baggage claim.  Now Im certain of what I had suspected in the first place before I arranged a trade with hezron-- I *must* try this on draft at the brewery.  This review will have to do for now.  Let it just warn you that taking growlers away and shipping them out to far-away regions, you could have similar results to what Ive found.  Thanks for trying, hezron.  Well split one together at the brewery when I make it out there.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
4162,"2005-04-22",3.2,"Time to put this beer where it belongs: Far far away from the Top 50.  This was growlered and sent across the country, however it seemed to be unaffected from the journey.  No stale flavors and full carbination, and so...i tell my tale.  Clear, burnt mohagany liquid sat in the glass and emitted a solventy and nutty aroma clothed in mildewy lagerness and a splenda-enriched caramelness.  Crisp nutty flavor but somewhat watery i suppose..not that its supposed to be full..but it certainly did have a nice fluffiness to it..like fluffy nuts...its just akin to a light cigarette..its missing that UMpH! that i need for satisfaction.  Its weak and its not complex and it doesnt stand out in the slightest.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
4162,"2005-04-10",4.1,"On tap at the brewery.  Dark, dark brown in appearance without much of a head.  Sweet  nutty roast aroma.  Nutty caramel and burnt chocolate flavors, very smooth.  I look forward to drinking my growler of this.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
4162,"2004-05-29",4.2,"Im drinking this from a week old growler, and its still excellent. Dark brown, almost black. Wonderful bock scent, and a nice vinous, roast taste. Good stuff.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","Pjones6738"
4162,"2004-05-27",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 28, 2004 WOW!  It's been a while since I've had a kick-ass bock, but this one fills the bill.  Taste somewhat like a cross between a stout and a bock, but is damn good nonetheless!  Picked up a growler of this for my friend after having two pintis of it at the brewery (their last barrell of the year).  I am reluctant to give it to my friend.","MIlwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","TheDean"
4162,"2003-04-28",3.9,"WOW, probably the best bock i have ever had.  I think i should have got a growler of this instead of the dark.  This was just excellent!!!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
4162,"2002-06-02",3.5,"A solid bock, yet not worldclass.  Somewhat light, overly fizzy, black in color, fantastic bock aroma.  Significant bitter aftertaste.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
4162,"2002-05-05",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2004 What a smooooth bock.  I started  with the dark when I was here and then tried the sampler, wish I would have started with the bock.  The caramel and malt flavors really shine.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
4162,"2002-03-08",4.7,"another great beer from rowlands....delicious flavor....as a matter of fact id like a half jug right now....one of the few bright spots of my hometown of Chilton, WI","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","CrotchMonkey99"
4162,"2001-09-16",4.6,"What an excellent brew!  This is precision beer, people.  The chocolate overtone reflects their Dark, but the overall taste of the brew surpasses damn near anything in its category.  A must for any self-respecting Bock fan.  If only they made an Eisbock...!  If youre in town, stop at Rollins for one hell of a brew.","Wisconsin, USA","Got Stout?"
4162,"2001-05-19",4.1,"This is the first Bock I have had so I am not sure how it compares, but I do like it alot.","Wisconsin, USA","THE BEER BARON"
4162,"2001-04-07",4.8,"Whoohoo!  What an excellent beer.  I wish I could have a half jug for myself. This is one of the best beers I have ever had the opportunity of trying.  What came to my mind as I drank this beer was, I didnt know beer could taste this good.  Whooohoo!","Whitewater, Wisconsin, USA","Blatz King"
4162,"2001-03-29",4.0,"Very good, but I would still recommend the Calumet Dark.  I certainly prefer a Stout.","Wisconsin, USA","The Friar99"
