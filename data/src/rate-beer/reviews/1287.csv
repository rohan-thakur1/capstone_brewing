1287,"2012-09-02",4.1,"Cask at The Moon in the Square, Bournemouth. Now let me firstly say, this is a great ale! A clear medium amber pour with little head and no lace. A really fruity aroma leading to an amazing hop explosion! It had a wonderfully complex set of flavours with a surprisingly smooth edge and citrus notes. The bitterness sits on the palate for a good while longer too. A really special ale which I wish was more widely available.

Like satsuma and tangerine and that really small orange fruit with a funny name kumquat?  Very little condition in mouth due to being the last bit out.  But the fullness in the mouth and girgeous hop finish is unmistakeable.  I really is very good.  I have seen Hawkshead as solud their stout is very good and remember drinking that and the bitter in the Ship and Mitre in Liverpool.  And their red ale at Kent BF.  So they clearly make memorable beer.  This could be good but hard to tell in this condition.  Citra is definite as is the Bramling Cross bitterness.  I need this again.

Gold with a lively white creamy unsparkled head. Good juicy malt coupled with buckets of resinous hops, in a really skillfully blended recipe that Thornbridge, Stone and the likes   would be proud of. The best Spoons Festival beer mixing English and  US hops since Stone/Sheps 2xIPA in 2008. Superb!","Harrow, Greater London, ENGLAND","bobinlondon"
