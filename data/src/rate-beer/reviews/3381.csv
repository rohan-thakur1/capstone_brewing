 Kolor:  Żółty. Piwo jest zamglone. 
 Piana:  Piana jest po prostu wybitna. Monstrualnej wielkości kopiec śnieżnobiałego puchu.
Człowiek patrzy na to i ma wrażenie jakby miał jeść bitą śmietanę.
Piana w ogóle nie chce opadać w dół.
Spoglądam na nią i podziwiam bez końca. Lacing jest niebywały. (5/5). 
 Zapach:  To jest dopiero owocowe bogactwo! Cały las tropikalny zamknięty w małej puszeczce.
Intensywny żywiczny, leśny aromat.
Ogrom nut owocowych, gdzie prym wiodą owoce cytrusowe: ananasy, grejpfruty, pomarańcze i mandarynki.
Na zapleczu odrobina słodszych tropików: mango i papaja. 
 Smak:  Na języku tańczą całe tabuny żółtych owoców cytrusowych.
Limonki, grejpfruty, cytryny, ananasy i mandarynki.
Towarzystwa dotrzymują im żywiczne, sosnowe, leśne niuanse.
Słody całkowicie przykryte są chmielami.
Czuć ich dominującą siłę, głębię i charakter.
Goryczka jest średniego kalibru.
Wyróżnia ją wytrawny profil i grejpfrutowy, mocny finisz.
Piwo znika ze szkła z prędkością Freezbee rzuconego z rozmachem.
Etykieta doskonale wbija się w letni charakter piwa. Kolory żółty, zielony kojarzą się ze słoneczną pogodą, wakacjami i czasem relaksu.
Umiarkowana do wysokiej tekstura trunku to zasługa użytych płatków owsianych.
Sesyjność to drugie imię tego tego trunku. 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Ostatnim razem piłem BeVoga grubo ponad rok temu. Już wtedy piwa z tego austriackiego browaru przykuły moją uwagę. Na początku szałową grafiką, a potem jak się okazało i świetnym smakiem.

Kiedy nadarzyła się okazja kupienia kolejnych piw z BeVoga nie wahałem się ani chwili.

Freezbee Beer jest piwem perfekcyjnie zbalansowanym z bogatą, obfitą, bujną pianą.
Pachnie lasem, żywicą, a dodatkowo owocami cytrusowymi.
Smak jest zrównoważony, intensywnie cytrusowy z delikatną słodową bazą.
Goryczka jest umiarkowana, a całość wpasowuje się idealnie w mój gust.
Jak zobaczycie gdzieś piwa z BeVoga to bierzecie w ciemno!","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

Taste is refreshing mild fruity with bready maltiness, nicely hopped with pleasant grassy bitter finish. Light body, slick texture and average carbonation in palate. This one didnt convince me, not bad for sure, but I know Bevog can do it better...","Koper, SLOVENIA","Kita"

3381,"2016-06-16",3.9,"A wonderfully hoppy aroma with hints of fruits and grassy notes. Body is well carbonated but not as strong as one would expect for an IPA, however there's still plenty of hoppy taste there. The aftertaste is more tasty fruity hoppyness, that dissipates quickly and isn't too bitter after that. This makes for a perfect summer IPA, and there's hard to find any way to improve on it. Tasty, light and a perfect beer for IPA fans on a hot day.","Maribor, SLOVENIA","mjakopa"
