1790,"2016-07-14",4.0,"BBD 2016. Pours black. Normal head volume, poor lacing and retention.

Outstanding nose of light roast, dark chocolate, raisins with plum notes, caramel and light molasses with a bit of caramel.

Light full bodied with a smooth texture that has a bit of creaminess. Slightly below normal carbonation level and is a bit low for the body. Light effervescence in the middle and prickly in the finish.

The flavor profile is quite outstanding. The 9% ABV is very well covered by the rich complex flavors. All the flavors of the nose appear, but mostly in blended fashion. Sweet molasses and caramel form the base with roast on the top. Bitterness is a hint in the middle and mostly roast based.

1790,"2016-05-28",3.9,"Wow, this beer shoots for and nearly achieves greatness. A phenomenally superior Baltic Porter, with an excellent coffee and sweet tobacco leaf aroma, nice ruby-brown-black appearance, but with a rather minimal head, looks very flat. The flavor profile is perfect, slightly charred roasted malt, predominantly still sweet and warm maltiness, as a porter ought to be. Some dark fruit notes and an alcohol sweetness, but no boozy tartness, very well done. Indeed very smooth and pleasant texture, with minimal carbonation. My only dissatisfaction that keeps me from going a full 4/5 stars with this beer is its lack of body, personally I would much prefer some additional foam and texture. Still delicious and I will definitely drink again.","South Carolina, USA","eRock_2013"

The head is khaki , and the brew is a dark brown in this glass. It retains fairly well - with very light spotting. The aroma seems like classic baltic - a heavy roast, mineral water, with a dark fruit bouquet. The flavor profile is nice - It begins with chocolate malts, dark fruits, with roasty notes moving through a bittering feeling that gets rounded out by a hint of booze.

1790,"2016-01-22",3.6,"Looks like the calendar had some really good beers in it - but i smartly stayed away from that massive money pit. Solid aroma of chocolate, some sweetness and coffee, raisins, dust, hint of raspberries. Pretty tasty with a bit of burnt aftertaste and probably alcohol - faint but there. Maybe its more than faint but its tied in well with the bitterness. Deep roast and truckloads of malts, toffee, light medicinal stuff, charcoal, hints of citrus. I didnt find this particularly smooth nor did I enjoy the hard bite. It did leave my mouth heavily coated with beer load - probably the thing I enjoyed the most here is the lasting feeling like I ate an entire chapstick. Thick bodied. I really dont think I was in the mood for this but, really, that just points towards a general meh despite what is here.

 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  Served a deep brown nearly black brew with a thick and creamy one finger tan colored head. The head has a nice level of retention, slowly fading over about 5 min to leave a moderate level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is big of dark and roasty smells. A sweet dark fruit aroma of cherry and plum are mixed with dark chocolate and a good presence of a roasted malt smell. Along with these are some notes of a light caramel nature as well as a good presence of a boozy smell that overall creates a very warming smell.

 Taste  The flavor begins with a relatively healthy amount of dark fruit and a roasted malt tastes. Cherry, prune and raisin are all present upfront and are quickly met with other flavors of a dark chocolate nature soon after the initial tastes. As the flavor advances further the fruit grows slightly less intense with other flavors of some more roasted malt taking its place. Toward the end the darker flavors of chocolate and roasted malt are now most potent and are joined by a complementing smoke and alcohol taste which in the end leave a nice dark but still sweeter more burnt flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is on the creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side of the scale. The thicker and creamier body are great for helping all the roasted, chocolate and smoky flavors of the brew to really stand out while the lighter carbonation, coupled with the creamy nature and the boozy taste at the end, make it a nice sipping beer.

 Overall  A good sweeter Baltic porter that is nice to sit back with and sip over a nice cool evening. A rather enjoyable brew and one to try if you get the opportunity.","","Darkmagus82"

1790,"2014-08-09",2.8,"First let's me start by saying that I am loving this beer. The only reason for the low score is because they put Baltic porter on the label. If you are going to declare a style it should taste like the style. Besides it being way to high in abv it also has way to much roast and more of a RIS flavor then anything else.

1790,"2014-03-02",3.8,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours an extremely dark ruby color. The head is a one finger khaki shade, and its superbly creamy in texture even for the style. Retention is okay, too.

S: This seems to be very woody in its aroma, almost oaky, even. Theres also a great element of cocoa powder here, along with some smoke and tart cherries. What dominates the aroma is roasted, slightly charred malts - and thats a good thing. <3 roast. Really a nice aroma.

T: Like many good Baltic porters (the one Smuttynose makes, for instance), the predominant note is vaguely tart malt mixed with a charred roast. Meanwhile, the initial flavors are very chocolaty. Not quite a 4-level flavor profile, but it isnt far off from that mark, either.

M: It could use slightly more body, but otherwise, the crisp finish is very satisfying. Even still It seems designed more for drinkability than savorability, and its successful in that regard. There isnt a hint of alcohol anywhere on the palate, and the carbonation is rather low.

1790,"2014-01-31",4.5,"This beauty is a lot more complex than its Porter sister. Although they look virtually identical in the glass, nice and black with a mentionable but not unforgetable off-white head, the aroma here is dark chocolate, also very strong, plus dulce de leche, and a good dose of booze. The flavours open into a broader, multi-layered horizon, with bitter chocolates, caramels, salty fudge, chinese red vinegar, Dutch salty liquorice, plums, cranberries, molasses, kicap manis, vegemite... oh such a vast array, not sure whether a foreign stout or a baltic porter. The absence of roasts though confirm the style. This is a creamy, full-bodied beauty.

1790,"2014-01-29",3.8,"12 oz bottle, thanks to fletchfighters. Served at cellar temperature. I had never heard of the Duck-Rabbit before this. Pours deep, dark brown with off-white head that dissipates to a ring of bubbles that sticks around for the duration of this drink. Aroma: First thing I smell is cherries. Thats followed by some alcohol, which is followed by roast, which is followed by smoke (my wife immediately said ""beef jerky,"" to which I replied ""yeah! and band-aids!""). Taste: Moderately sweet, with surprisingly dry finish. Other flavors that come up once it gets in my mouth include marshmallow (full disclosure: I read a friends review, but as soon as I went looking for it the marshmallow was unmistakably present) and roasted nuts. Initially I wasnt too keen on this, but it definitely grew on me as the glass went on. Palate: medium-full body, slick texture that fully coats the inside of my mouth. Overall: Ive encountered a lot of beers that are awesome over the first few ounces but are hard to finish a full glass of. This one was the opposite -- the first 2-3 ounces were disappointing (I mean, not bad or anything, but the flavors didnt really seem to gel, and certainly didnt approach what the 796 people before me have averaged out to), but by the second half of the bottle it all sort of got there. At 2-3 ounces Id give this something like a 3.6. By the end its a 4. Im going to split the difference.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

1790,"2013-02-22",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2014 12oz bottle, with no notch on date strip, poured into a Avery nonic. 
A: The beer is a deep dark brown color, with a moderate tan head that fades slowly. Thick lacing is left on the glass at first, but only spotty lacing after the head dies down.

The aroma has a very pronounced dark chocolate note, plenty of dark roasted malts, a little hops and coffee, and some dark fruit. It also has a hint of molasses.

T: The taste has a slight bit of sourness, but otherwise the off-note is much diminished. Otherwise, the aromatic components are repeated in the flavor, with the addition of a little smoky and earthy tint. The bitter-sweet and slightly smoky after-taste ;ingers for a good while and features chocolate, coffee and dark malts.

M: Full bodied and smooth, with somewhat high, medium carbonation. A light harshness and warming from the high ABV. 

O: Rich, fruity and distinct version of this style may not appeal to all baltic porter fans.

Pours a very deep and dark brown, mostly black colored body with a thin, fizzy, dark brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves a light lacing. Aroma is fairly malty sweet with lots of plum and raisin dark fruits, molasses, dark and milky chocolate, a light cherry, and a moderate roast. Some slightly smoky leather, a touch of licorice, and a light vanilla. Flavor is similar. Somewhat cloyingly sweet initially with lots of figgy, raisin, plummy dark fruits. Plenty of molasses, milk chocolates, and dark chocolates with a moderate roast that increases nicely towards the end. A touch of licorice, some leathery smoke, plenty of raisin dark fruits, sweet malts, and the increased roasts as this finishes pretty sweet and malty, but the roasts cut the sweetness nicely and dont keep this cloying like it seems up front. A touch of acidity with the dryness with some vanilla creeping in and just the slightest hint of alcohol warmth. Lengthy aftertaste following a full, slightly syrupy body and a light carbonation. Overall, a really complex baltic porter. Lots of dark fruits, chocolates, molasses, roasts, and a nice acidity.

Nose was very smokey and sensual with superb dried fruit notes woven into the smokiness.  Flavors bring back some of the smoke yet not as much as the nose let on..the fruit notes arent really there much though I do get some berry flavors..the body is about medium..I was hoping for a little more ooomph here as it seems theres something missing...though Im not exactly sure what it is. The roasty/smokey notes are nice, but maybe a bit more aggressive hopping or a touch more sweetness would bring out the flavors more...maybe its too cold.   It is balanced though and focused and coherent and the alcohol is completely hidden all pro-like...but that being said, at the current moment, the flavors just arent popping out like I want them to.  Well see...Ill be back when it warms.  Ok, im back...after giving my son a bath and reading a few bed time stories, the beer has warmed to around room temp.  Flavors are a little more pronounced...some chocolate has entered the picture..maybe a hint of the dried fruit noticed in the nose..theres a somewhat metallic/tinniness going on, but not really all that distracting.  The roast is a little more pronounced as well...and a milky lactic touch in the finish.  So, definitely opens up a bit as it warms.

12oz bottle received in a trade with limesmut. Thanks again

Poured a dark brown/black with a tan/brown head that disappeared gradually. Smell is roasty, figgy malts, and a bit of alcohol. Taste is roasty malt with a lactose type sweetness mixed in there. Thick mouthfeel that coats the taste buds after each sip. Respectable brew from Duck Rabbit, I wish I could get their stuff locally.

Received in trade from KarrHeel03 and Revisited 12/13/2009

Pours a solid black with a good sized tan head that dissipates quickly to a ring on top and minimal lacing. Smells of dark chocolate and roasted coffee up front, touch of hops and alcohol hidden underneath. Taste is rich with chocolate and dark fruits. I imagine sour cherries and black currant as I sip this one. It proves to be quite sweet but the burn of alcohol in the finish mixed with a distant hop bitterness keeps it from being cloying. Creamy almost syrupy mouthfeel, thick body, light carbonation. I think I enjoyed this a lot more this time around. I have another bottle that I think will age for a while and revisit in a few years. My score reflects this most recent tasting.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"

1790,"2011-01-07",3.3,"Just about opaque black pour with a thin, quickly dissipating head. Aroma is lots of coffee, bittersweet chocolate, caramel, and bitter dark roasted malts. Definitely some boozy notes in there as well. Flavor has an odd sort of tanginess from the flavors melding together. The dark malts, coffee, and booze combine with a pretty strong touch of dark fruits to create a very unique flavor. Im not really sure if I like it or not. Palate is par for the style, rich and full bodied. Its certainly different than most other Baltic Porters, but I dont know that different is better in this case. Im a little disappointed in this one, to be honest. Not really the flavor I was expecting, and entirely too boozy for 9% ABV.","Ambler, Pennsylvania, USA","Steeeve"

1790,"2011-01-04",4.0,"Black pour with a small dark brown head.  Left almost no lace, head faded in quick fashion to nothing.  Aroma was rich milk chocolate, almost melted candy bar like, a light roast character was thrown throughout.  Flavors were big and rich, cocoa, light coffee ground and a light char presence.  All mixed together for a world class porter.  Carbonation was medium to soft leaving a silky smooth mouthfeel.  Viscous.  Excellent stuff.

I got very excited for this when I smelled it, but a bit disappointed with the flavor and mouth feel. Still a great beer, lots of rich malty flavors and very smooth.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","savnac"

1790,"2010-12-12",3.2,"I poured this 12 oz bottle into a snifter. This is a sledgehammer of a beer, thick, viscous, and so dark that I swear the lights dimmed in the kitchen when I opened it. It raised a surprising 2 finger head the color of chocolate mousse, though that quickly dissipated to lacing (and may simply have resulted form the secondary fermentation in this 2009 bottling). This beer raises aromas of chicory, licorice, fennel, and anise, and complements those flavors with roasted chestnuts and a powerful, up front sweetness not unlike sweetened condensed milk. Overall, then, this is a lot like Vietnamese coffee, with competing abundances of bitter/roast flavors and sweetness. Its not my thing, but even I can recognize that it is a fine example of the style.","Athens, Georgia, USA","bjt512"

Taste is bitter and a bit like soy sauce, with a bit of cloying sweetness at the end.  Mouthfeel is oily smooth with medium carbonation.

1790,"2010-11-18",4.0,"Bottle. Poured into my CCB tulip glass a dark brown color with what starts as a 1/4 inch dark tan head that quickly settles to form a tan collar around the glass. The first aroma I smell is that of roasty coffee mixed with milky chocolate, slight tobacco, but overall a very mellow smell. Swirling to get a better smell creates some nice lace around the glass. The alcohol is pretty apparent in teh first sip I take but also dark fruits, roast, coffee, chocolate, and a touch of leather. Medium/heavy mouthfeel and pretty creamy. Slightly dry finish.

A lot of sweet dark fruit flavors that I didnt pick much up of in the aroma.

Aroma is sweet like a Starbucks (more like a Thai) iced coffee, with a lot of sugar.  Mouthfeel is very good; clean yet sticky.  Taste is full of coffee and roast.  Plenty of alcohol flavor and syrup to go along with it.  Very good beer but a bit too sweet and sticky for me.  I think of a baltic porter as a bit lighter with less alcohol and it shouldnt leave my mouth like I just ate pancakes at the Waffle House.  Other than the alcohol and stickyness it really has some great flavor though.","Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","dagimp"
1790,"2010-09-14",4.1,"The pours is deep and dark, similar to any good imperial stout, with a thin medium chocolate brown head. The aroma has just a bit of crisp sweetness and the slightest touch of booze. The flavor, however, is richly sweet, with flavors of bittersweet chocolate and molasses, and an underlying bitterness akin to a lightly roasted coffee. The mouthfeel is silky smooth. If it were any sweeter, it would almost seem syrupy with how little carbonation it has, but the smoothness works with the flavor to create a rich, decadent, but smooth drinking experience.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","devilben02"

Full-bodied and deep; vanilla bean and malty sweetness nothing close to cloying- offset by some mild, bittering pumpernickel toast.

For a third and final time, Thanks Ethan.","Granville, Illinois, USA","GranvilleTim"

The palate is thick, rich, velvety, and fully effervescent. A damn fine example of a damn fine style.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
1790,"2010-03-12",4.1,"Thanks to jblauvs for this one. Black pour with reddish tints on the edges, small head. Aroma is definitely of a baltic porter, and it is really nice. Notes of roasted malt, bakers chocolate, coffee, a flutter of dark fruit, cocoa nib, and molasses.

The flavor was rich, sweet and boozy with a very big coffee presence enhanced by chocolate and caramel notes and some roastiness, very complex flavor.  The palate was thick and warming with alcohol.  Overall a really big porter, but a little too sweet for my tastes.","Columbia, Pennsylvania, USA","machfive55"
1790,"2010-03-03",4.1,"Deep pitch black coloured body with a fully opaque body, a very thin tan head and the legs of a deep bordeaux, making for a nice look! Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, bitter nuts and a bunch of alcohol - oh yeah, some deep fruits too. Full-bodied; Deep roasty flavours with a lot of sweet vanilla and lightish fruits at the front of the palate - odd and nice at the same time. Aftertaste shows a more refined and deep roasty taste, a ton of milk and lactic qualities and some strong vanilla too - not so much coffee or chocolate though. Overall, a very nice baltic porter - great for the style, and showing a bit of a milk stout quality, which isnt common for the style. Id definitely recommend this, and was very happy to sample it, but at the end of the day, Id still prefer a Zywiec Porter!

Shockingly smooth on the palate, it has a rich creamy texture with a mild level of carbonation.  Contains a strong chocolate malt flavor with some subtle dark fruit character and a well balanced layer of background bitterness.

This is a huge porter, as in flavor-wise its almost more like a barleywine.  It has a huge level of sweet malts.  Very good presence of dark roasted coffee.

There is also some consistency issues with this beer...Ive had a few over the years that were off, even beyond the sourness it picks up over time, as well as one that was completely flat and not very good at all (guessing it wasnt capped properly).  This loses a lot of its luster as you get to the bottom of the glass.  Overall incredibly flavorful, and packs quite a punch, feels like 11%, but I think its a little over-rated.  I do prefer Sinebrychoff Porter, but this is also an excellent example of a Baltic Porter, and one I will enjoy each year it comes out.","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"

1790,"2009-07-29",3.9,"pours black or a very dark brown. Aroma is  rather boozy with notes of chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Flavor is very weird for a baltic porter in my opinion much sweeter than what I am accustomed to. Notes of alcohol, almond, fruit (raisin and fig), coffee and chocolate are ever present. In addition to the afformentioned flavors I also detect molasses. The lingering flavor after a swallow is better than the initial taste.","Westfield, Massachusetts, USA","dogfish120love"

Pours black with the old espresso swirl head and a small lace. The aroma is roasty coffee molasses and chocolate, simple and straight forward but absolutely awesome and enticing. The flavor has an amazing start with chocolate with some cherries and some coffee. Sweet but not cloying at all. There is a little burnt maltiness and a but of alcohol which both play nicely in the balance of this beer. Very cordial like! Very viscous!","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

1790,"2009-07-07",3.7,"12 oz bottle courtesy of a GAManiac trade. Thanks, Grant! I continue the Duck Rabbit Trek.. just this and one more to go! Pours a very dark near black pour, fairly thick, ruby edges, fair light brown chocolate milk head that laces some, stays at a small layer. Aromas are a nice chocolate base, sweet and semi sweet mix, with coffee, roasted malts, a touch of caramel, a light dark fruitiness of plum and muted cherries. Initial is farly heavy bodied, throwing chocolate, a bit bitter, with roasted malts, a caramel malt sweetness combined with plum and cherries come through stronger, dark fruits are plentiful. Fairly rich and decadent, a bit cakey, but the dark fruits come out after the chocolate (The other major element of the beer in my opinion). A bit creamy and heavy bodywise (Not a bad thing), Finish is a bit sweet, with fairly good roast, and some decent dark fruitiness coming out even there. A pretty good brew overall. Smooth and rich.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

1790,"2009-05-16",3.7,"12oz bottle at matt7215s place, his bottle, thanks for holding onto this one for me Matt. Pours a nice viscous dark brown, barely translucent with a tiny mocha head. The aroma is huge on the soy sauce, also rich burnt caramalt and toffee, leather as well as anise. Not amazing but nothing too off-putting. The flavour is full of the above mentioned aspects working well off of eachother as well as some residual sugar and a fuller mouth-feel. Surprisingly fizzy, though thankfully this doesnt spoil the show. A tad astringent and with okay balance but not escaping the realm of a very sweet beer. No fruity esters as one would expect from a beer made with lager yeast. Not my favourite Baltic Porter, though I still quite enjoyed it. Nicely done though I dont fully comprehend such a high rating.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

1790,"2009-04-07",4.3,"Single bottle purchased at Chucks in Chagrin.  At first sniff (pre-pour) it was clear this was not the usual porter.  It smells of dried strawberries (my favourite dried fruit.) Upon further nasal inspection, it has some blueberry, fig and raisin notes.  This aroma is very fruity, amazingly so in fact, given that it all smells natural, not processed, artificial or added.  Appearance of this one is a nice black with a thin dark mocha head on it.  The flavor is outstanding.  I dont know if this fits into what I expect from a baltic porter, it isnt really bitter, dry or that roasty.  This is smooth and fruity with a finish of coffee and chocolate.  God, this is fantastic.  The flavor this amazing fruity flavor, dried strawberries again, and just melts right into this gentle bitterness and rich malty flavor.  I need to get my ass to North Carolina for some of this brew, it is top notch.  Normally with a 9%er I am expecting some serious flavors, something that I need to slow down with an takes some chewing to get into.  Not this, it is the perfect level of complex yet enjoyable.  Fruity and hearty, and fan-fucking-tastic.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"

Aroma is quite sweet, lots of malt, some roasty bitterness hidden back there, a touch of chocolate, vanilla, and some coffee. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth, and somewhat oily.

1790,"2009-01-01",3.9,"Bottle courtesy of kmweaver. Pours black with a small mocha head that diminishes to a thin ring and a few islands of bubbles at the surface. The nose is a big sweet blend of roasted malt, chocolate, tart dark fruit, coffee, tobacco and alcohol. Full-bodied and oily-slick with fine carbonation and a roasty, mildly tart/acidic finish. The flavor follows the nose with an emphasis on the dark roasted malt, tobacco and tart dark fruit notes. This is an interesting and tasty brew.

1790,"2008-11-30",3.7,"This thing has the appearance of a good imperial stout. I was very impressed. Opaque, and a nice thin chocolate colored head sitting on top. Whoa, this made my Saturday night, forget the ladies, right guys!? This beer is too one sided for me. It is all about the roast. I don’t think the description is misleading. I am actually glad that I didn’t pay for a 6-pack and found this in a mix-a-six section of Green’s. The beer has a weak aroma of roast. It also has some sweet aroma, but not much. I am not impressed because this thing is not that pungent to me. I am not sick, so it is not my nostrils.  I can say this is a nice creamy beer. The alcohol really comes out with the roast which is a nice combo. I like this roast taste. I just think it is too one sided. There is some slight coffee, and chocolate taste, but the damn roast is taking over my life at this moment. The sweet flavor really comes out at first, but the other flavors quickly kick in. Overall, I think the beer is nice, but just focuses too heavily on the roast. As for a ""sipping beer"" I don’t know I need something a little more harsh to stop. I would say that for a Baltic Porter, and I have only had 2, this was the better one.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

Dominant smells are roasted chocolate malts with a bit of burnt coffee and some dark fruits.  Some licorice and vanilla sweet in the background as well.

The taste is a drier, hoppier version of the smell.  There is still the big roasted malt character up front with some sweetness of vanilla and dark fruits.  But its the finish that really stands out with the hops leaving a dry espresso bitterness into the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a bit drier character than most baltic porters I have tasted.  Not a lot of carbonation in this one.

Its got fantastic roast character, great alcohol nuances, good caramel maltiness, and a crispness that keeps it lively. Fruitiness rises from the roast, alcohol or lagering. Although, the yeast product profile seems more ale-like, which might make this unusually complex. Palate is bright, crisp, dry and balanced. Nice beer. Its got some of the quite complexity that demands a more deft palate to completely appreciate, but the roast character melds with alcohol and fruit so well to make this stunning at any level.

Dark, dark, dark. No light whatsoever escapes. A rich, cocoa colored head slowly builds as I pour this. I end up with about a half inch thick of creamy, milkshake like foam, which slowly settles and leaves a ring around the edges. As I swirl the beer, tiny bits of foam stick to the glass, and you can see the legs slowly slip down the side of the glass. Very impressive!! 

Aroma is fantastic. Espresso, toffee, chocolate milk, slightly alcoholic, a bit of fruitiness, almost like a dark chocolate covered cherry cordial. 

The taste doesnt disappoint. Milk chocolate, cappucino, slightly bitter from alcohol and coffee flavors. 

Rich, smooth, velvety mouthfeel, with a definite alcohol burn. Lingering bitter aftertaste leaving you with a nice warmth all the way down.

Overall  One of the best Porter I have ever had and I love these beers. Had flavor t give and did not come across huge was a subtle beer for the late night last drink of the night beer.","Olympia, Washington, USA","BrewDad"
1790,"2008-04-07",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2008 Bottle, courtesy tronraner. Pours a deep black, with brownish highlights. A dark reddish brown head. Decent lacing. Aromas of rich roasted malts, vanilla, licorice, chocolate, dark candy, and brown sugar. Delightful. Roasted coffee flavors; very malty. Vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, raisin...a symphony of flavors. Rich, smooth, warming. Very easy to drink at 9%. Texture is chalky and requires full appreciation. Simply sublime.","Tampa, Florida, USA","gunhaver"
1790,"2008-04-04",3.5,"Thanks for the bottle, Duane, good until August of 2008. The body is perfect black with an orangeish brown head. The aroma is strong coffee with some anise hints and molasses. The taste has some very sweet molasses. There is also some light coffee and a tart cherry finish. This has a boozy finish with an overall smooth body. Nice smelling, but the tartness really did not balance well with the rest of the beer. Some friends that know their stuff tell me that the tart finish comes from molasses that has gone bad. Maybe this one is better when fresh.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

1790,"2008-03-25",3.9,"Bottle. As sweet as this baltic porter is, it is not cloying  balanced by roasted malts and licorice. Opaque brown pour with a frothy, but short, head that diminishes quickly. The enticing aroma is sweet with molasses and caramel. There are strong notes of roasted malts and licorice and hints of sweet chocolate and plums. The flavor is moderately to heavily sweet and lightly bitter. Dry, bitter finish. Medium body and watery texture with a middle-of-the-road carbonation. The body was less full than expected and perhaps that is one of the reasons this seems like a dangerous drinker  clean throughout. Very nice, indeed.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"

The body isnt as chewy as expected, I am assuming to the lagering.  Bitter chocolate and cherry juice are upfront, with a second surge of fudgey chocolate, vanilla, coffee and nuts.  Finishes really sweet, almost cane sugar sweet.  Interesting and complex.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"
1790,"2008-03-24",3.9,"Poured from a 120z bottle and is a dark amber black with a small tannish whie head that leaves a sticky ring at the top of the glass. 

Very malty roasted aroma with some chocolate notes as expected. 

Chocolate notes are strong upon first taste and have some raisin/fruitiness that comes through in the roasted malts. Very rich but smooth. 

Not too overwhelming and has a nice body. The finish is nice and not too strong considering the 9% ABV. Unfortunately this isnt a session beer for me also because of the alcohol. 

Id like to try more of this if I can and enjoy this baltic porter style so I was quite happy with this beer and look forward to other Duck-Rabbit offerings.","Dublin, IRELAND","jspruit"

Way different than I expected, and honestly, much better than I expected also.  Poured a deep brown color with a thin tan head that diminished to a ring.  Aroma of chocolate and roasted malts along with a sweet fruitiness peaking through also.  Flavor of roasted malts with light chocolate that is offset by a slightly tangy flavor, with undertones of sweet fruit that leads into a lightly smoky, dry, chewy finish.

I really am not digging the taste of this one.  The alcohol comes on very strong and tastes like leather wrapped in licorice.  The mouthfeel is decent with good carbonation, but the finish is very dry, kind of like a merlot.  I dont think Id try this one again.","New Jersey, USA","abcfan"

Some licorice and soy in the taste as well. Really quite a bit going on in this one. The finish has the acidic bite that I love in an Imperial / Baltic porter.  Nice full palate.  Integrates the alcohol really well.  I had been a bit underwhelmed by the regular Duck Rabbit line up, but this is really good.

Long finish.

Havent had other baltic porters, and it took me a few to get used to it, in part because the thin palate surprised me. Im told this is true to style. This was a very  complex and challenging beer for me, and I encourage haters to be patient and perhaps try again.  I was won over...

Re-rate: trying a fresh &&#35;40;two-week old?&&#35;41; bottle now, and its so rewarding.  Fuller, more creamy mouthfeel than last time I tried.  Every bit as complex as before.

Aroma is coffee, cream, and licorice in a very nice combination. Flavor is just as complex: chocolate, toffee, slight coffee. Tastes almost like candy, but is never sticky or too sweet, it really strikes the perfect balance. Warms you up as you drink, and gives a slight coffee aftertaste.

Full nectar with very lively effers that create an almost creamy texture. It has the consistantcy of chocolate milk. Chocolate malted sweetness followed by a moderate roast component. Some leather, molases, and tar can be spotted in the distance. The finish is long with sweet coffee and a touch of sour. Overall: this brew is thick and very rich. It coats the palate and sticks like glue.Decent balance. The only thing that bothers me is a faint rootbeer essence.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"
1790,"2008-02-14",3.8,"Courtesy of Degarth. Pours deep dark with dark brown edges and tan foam ring of foam. The aroma is a bit of roasty malts, bigger burnt malts follow shortly after along with chocolate malts, coffee grounds and a mild earthiness. Really nice aroma but missing the dark fruity esters that are a typical contributor to the Baltic Porter style. The taste is thick and rich and velvety. I get roasty malts, burnt malts, coffee and chocolate malts that seem very much like an Imperial Stout. There is a sweetness that runs underneath all the roasty malt notes. Very enjoyable but misses the style in flavor and aroma.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Dark chocolatey licorice with a unique dash of something hard to describer - ""hay and a harvest full of toasty biscuits""?  Hard for me to put a finger on - but it was awesome.  All this surrounded by an earthy green jacket.  Really an eye opening aroma.  Flavor was a notch below the marvelous nose - succulent smokey chocolate and a hint of sweet vanilla.

Pitch black, velvety pour with transparent maroon edges and some reddish bubbles and surface swirls. The aroma is fantastic! Chocked full of licorice, toasted biscuit, anise, black cherry and chocolate liqueur. Some floral hops are noticeable as well. The flavor is a complex blend of sweet dark fruits, roasted chocolate malts with an espresso undertone. Some tangy citrus makes a statement in the finish, with more lingering sweet liqueurs and burnt wood. The palate is chewy and soft, with a good bitterness and a touch of acidity.

Nice retention and some sheet lacing. Finally resolves to a ringing of foam that never leaves. Nose of coffee, huge roasted malts, chocolate - Belgian and milk and then really more coffee/roasted notes. Doesnt smell like a Baltic Porter to me at all. Really missing any of the fruity notes that that style usually features. Flavor is very similar, this tastes like an Imperial Porter, and probably would be if RB had such a style. Tons of chocolate and sweet dark malts, but also a huge amount of roastiness and coffee grounds. Alcohol is very well hidden in both the aroma and the flavor profile, I wouldnt have guessed this was 9%, probably more like 7%. Chewy, full bodied, sweet palate.

A small, foamy tan head settles pretty quickly to just a thin rim, leaving behind minimal spotty lacing.  The aroma is intensely malty and rich.  Dark chocolate, roasty caramel, nougat, coffee, and dark fruits all emerge in well transitioned layers.  The nose is really inviting, despite mild alcoholic fumes.  The flavor follows suit, with malt after malt building upon one another.  It tastes like figs steeped in melted dark chocolate, all filtered and added to a roasty, creamy coffee.  Finishes medium long, roasty and bittersweet.  The body is full, smooth, and viscous.  Its almost silky, and perfectly carbonated.  Awesome beer.

Poured in my tulip glass. As it pours, it looks deep brown, but as it settles like oil in my glass, it becomes inpenetrably pitch-black. A medium creamy head sits firmly on top with a cappucino hold to it. Great laces as I swirl the beer gently in my glass, anticipating the first whiff, and after that, the first sip! Aroma is oaky, heavily roasted with a great touch of dark chocolate mixing well. The alcohol is evident, but only enhances the deep, dark and powerful aromas. There is some degree of tobacco and port as well. Mouthfeel is light, but still excessively creamy, with a sluggish, mild carbonation - only prickling lightly on my tongue. Wow, what a dense, creamy and mildly stunning degree of chocolate theres in this beer! Coffee, tobacco, warming viniousness. Extremely well-balanced between the bitter, roasted, sweet and vinious tones. Really, really wonderful. And thank you, Jeppe!","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"

The mouth feel is thick and quite smooth. Theres a moderate about of carbonation to tingle the tongue as well. Initially the flavor is that of dark chocolate. The alcohol provides a warming sensation on the way down. The alcohol is well played in this one. It is not overbearing nor unpleasant. As the beer warms, roasted coffee flavors begin to emerge, along with some dark fruit.

Recieved this long sought after beer from my Secret Santa, thanks again Tayner. Duck-Rabbits Baltic Porter pours as black as the ace of spades. Theres a hint of light peeking through if directly backlit. A one-plus dark brown head rose on the pour but fell rather quickly to a skimming. The head could have stuck around a little longer but besides that its a really good looking porter.

This beer smells big of freshly brewed black coffee. Its the most coffee Ive come across from a porter. Dark chocolate plays a big part in the aroma as well. The maltiness present is some dark doughy bread. The coffee dominates. If you ask me this turns out to be a great combo.

Big coffee upfront fades slightly and combines with the dark chocolate to create a great flavor combination. The doughy malts join the coffee and chocolate mid-palate and while all these flavors work through to the swallow dark fruit makes its appearence. This is one of best, if not the best, Baltic style porters I have ever had. 

Mouthfeel has just the right amount of heft for the heavy flavors. Good viscosity as it coats the tongue with each sip. The carbonation is sluggish and lets the beer works its way through slowly. The alcohol will leave your cheeks feeling a little arm.

This is a perfect beer with which to sip away these cold Winter evenings. This beer is a sipper for sure and the abv wont let you drink too many but Id drink these till I couldnt anymore.

This is my second offering from Duck-Rabbit and one of the best Baltic style porters I have yet to sample. This is a beer not to be missed. If you see it pick some up.

Original rating: AR7 AP2 T4 P2 OA8 TS 2.3********************
Allow me to explain...this rating is based on my personal preference. Thanks, Secret Santa for this top rated beer. Aroma was big...slight coffee, dark licorice and alcohol. Pour was a flat black with a tan head that popped up and left. Taste was flat, hot and thick. Strong licorice with hints of chocolate and vanilla. Burnt malt on the tongue and in the aftertaste. The big problem for me is this black licorice taste. Very strong alcohol burn. Once I got the point (as the label says) that it should be sipped slowly, I was convinced not to pour it out. Im not knocking the beer as Im sure if you like these big dark ones, you cant get better.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"

Rating #400!  Courtesy the man, kenb, 10/7/07.  Aged 1 year.  Im rating conservatively because I dont want to be a fanboy right off the bat.  But its right up there with the best, the few other 5s Ive ever had.  Aroma is AWESOME, and a good indicator of whats to come.  Heavy on the chocolate-covered cherry-or-raisin, in both aroma and palate.  Best aroma ever, period.  Goes down smoother n you know what.  The only thing I didnt give a top component grade for was appearance, I believe because it didnt generate large and foamy head.  We did some nitroing and fixed that issue, but Im just going on its ""official"" presentation.  I did a 19/20 on overall, but Im  gonna bump that up to a 20 and put this in sole possession of the 4.9 placement in my ratings list.  Thanks to the MAN, kenb, Ill get subsequent tastings and see how this fares on the repeat.

Aroma is a very very nice combination of toasted coconut and chocolate, maybe a touch of vanilla.  I wish I could smell the soy that others smell.  I could smell this all day (I seem to say that a lot recently in my ratings).  Wonderful aroma.  The roastiness is well balanced in a complex mesh of mild bitterness of chocolate and other flavors.

Smell is a deep roasty, sticky, teriyaki/soy like sweetness.  I got pretty much only hearty smells and no dried fruity sweet aromas from this one.  As it warms it smells more and more smoky, soy-like and like liquified smoked beef jerky.  Reminds me a lot of Flying Dog Gonzo Porter.  Taste is rich, with similar smoky roasty mildly tart/sweet soy flavors.  Mouthfeel is perfect.  Carbonated lightly, and the body is rich, thick, creamy and velvety smooth.  The alcohol is also extremely well hidden for 9 %, but the almost ""savory"" like heartiness and the smoky, meaty flavor I got from it would keep this from being a beer I personally could drink again and again.

1790,"2007-07-26",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2008 My Bottom Line:
An intricate interweaving of coffee roastiness, molasses sweetness and raisiny fruitiness seduces nostrils, tastebuds and soul. A perfumy dessert of a Baltic Porter has popped up in North Carolina!

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the brown-sleeved darkness.
-In the bottle, its nose was tempting, but not nearly as dazzling as the flavor profile. On tap though, I thought both were equally alluring.
-Roastiness is prolonged into bitterness, accompanied by a sweet soy bean and vanilla component.
-Alcohol barely warms up the back of the throat.
-In the bottle, carbonation is prickly, a little too much so for the firm body. On tap though, carbonation was perfectly suited to portly mouthfeel.
-A touch of tartness/vinosity follows the fruitiness.
-The most recent vintage (tasted in January 2008) may be sweeter than your average Baltic Porter, but it remains a fantastic pint for dessert.

1790,"2007-07-02",4.1,"Very interesting beer here.  I took an immediate sip and right out of the gates, whoa....this has got to be a 4.3 overall.  Upon deep reflection and analysis, not really the case.  Deep rich aromas, but a bit fusel.  I noticed, to my dismay, that its filtered clear and forced carbonated.  The resulting mouthfeel, while more than I anticipated, was still not quite there.  Had they left it bottle condition, perhaps a little more body could be found.  The flavour itself is what makes this beer.  Immediately a little smoke jumps out at you and then huge waves of raisins and figs.  An initial rush of roasted specialty malts with some charred bits all too soon give way to a sugary sweetness that overpowers all else.  I hesitate to say cloying, but walking right on the edge.  I understand that modern-day baltic porters typically carry quite a simple sugar backbone and subsequent sugary sweetness to it, so I give a nod to the style conditions.  Although, I wouldve liked to have seen a bit more balance in this regard.  On the back-end, I found the fusels again with a bit of heat.  Perhaps this could have been cellared a bit longer?  All in all, quite a gem and worth the effort to locate due to the intriguing flavours underneath that sugary backbone.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"

1790,"2007-06-21",4.2,"Sampled during Glouglous summer BBQ bonanza, but indoors, as it rained just long enough to have a Beer or two indoors 

Not 100% black, when you look at it really close you can see a bit of brownish hues near the café au lait head bobbling on top. But I certainly wont hold this against it.

Great roasted aromas, it was more nutty at first, then developped more of a smoked almond nose later on. Hops were firm and cheesy - in the good way, and all of a sudden they went all strawberry fruity and I just love that (Galena?).

Huge flavor and absolutely creamy mouthfeel, this is a real malt bomb with a side of chocolate slivers and a roasty finale like a well made expresso, with no residual harshness that you sometimes find even in some of the most classic examples of the style. I didnt find the alcohol very obtrusive, in fact it sort of only played a supportive role in what I thought was a great ensemble cast. Fantastic.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
1790,"2007-06-19",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 15, 2007 In short: Very good thick and sticky porter focussing on black-liquorice flavour
How: Tasting session bottle from MartinT.  Then a few months later a bottle left behind in my fridge by Dickinsonbeer and/or dmac621
The look: Black body topped by a tan ring of foam.
In long: Thick and heavy porter.  Theres obviously a lot of roasted malts in there but the beer doesnt have a lot of roastiness or chocolaty flavours.  Rather sweet.  Black liquorice is the dominant flavour backed-up by dark fruits, molasses and burnt caramel.  Thick and sticky body.  Medium carbonation.  Although it is very good it was starting to gross me out after only a small bottle.  Way above average porter but I dont understand why this beer is currently on ratebeer top-40 averaging about 4.2.

Awesome brew that is worthy of its world-class status.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1790,"2007-06-06",4.4,"Bottle from JCB - thanks, Jason!  A good one to break in the new Duvel glass.  Huge dark chocolate aroma with a good deal of roast and prominent soy sauce notes.  Motor oil-black pour, opaque, with a huge rich creamy rocky light brown head (quite the looker!).  Taste is roasty, lightly bitter with medium sweetness and light sourness/acidity.  Strong soy sauce with salt and light notes of smoke.  Faint molasses and some light burned, slightly nutty notes.  Hint of vanilla.  Silken, creamy mf with a medium-full body that just feels fuller.  Must be the loveliest mf of any beer Ive had this year.  Darkly fruity, and yet the result is light, playful, and extremely drinkable - not a hint of alcohol anywhere near this thing.  Really complex and cultured brew, very flavorful but subtle and nuanced.  Superb, world-class.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Aroma of coffee and roasted malt is dominant and enjoyable. Taste is dominated by dry coffee notes as well as some light bitter roasted malt. I was expecting more chocolate notes then I could detect and the beer was a bit more dry then expected. Body was quite full with some medium carbonation and no alcohol was discernable.

1790,"2007-05-15",4.3,"12oz bottle from Turdferguson.  Thank you Slam.  This is from my first of hopefully many beer trades.  The pour is midnight black with almost no head into my Narragansett pint glass.  The aroma is sweet chocolate, raspberries, soy sauce, and coffee.  The first sip is thick and tastes like chocolate covered strawberries.  Now I am halfway through this beer and I can barely detect the 9% abv and the chocolate /coffee flavors are still going strong.  The finish is more soy and fruit.  I think that the soy flavor could come from the alcohol and hops that are mostly covered by the super sweet flavors.  Wow.  This beer was enormously complex and way too easy to drink.  These 12 ounces disappeared too fast.  Now I cant wait for the imperial stout that I have lined up from this dank NC brewery.","Massachusetts, USA","skibumphishead"

1790,"2007-05-02",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2008 Wow, the best porter I have ever had.  I could swear this stuff was barrel aged.  Poured black with a nice deep brown head.  Smelled intense, hints of chocolate and roasty with characteristics of a red wine.  Taste was much the same, initial taste was grapey and wine, faded into chocolate, caramel, dark fruits, cherries, smoke and roasty.  Everything blended into a wall of flavor.  This porter will be very hard to top.

Re-rate:  I had this last year and it seemd so amazing.  Tried it again and it seemd boozy and unbalanced.  Either my taste has changed or this beer is not as good.  4.4 the first time.  3.8 the second.

Re-rate:  Man this beer is confusing.  Had it again, and it tasted like the first time I had it.  Maybe it just needs age or something.  Unbelievable chocolate cherry presence throughout.  Rich and delicious.  I guess I will bump it back up a few.","Holt, Michigan, USA","masonjer"

1790,"2007-04-28",3.0,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2009 Deep black with a dark brown head, forming medium sized bubbles and settling into a half-inch layer rather quickly.  Nose is a bit strange, like chocolate and chile pepper sauce, I cant really get into it right away.  The dark and bitter smelling chocolate is nice, and the malted milk ball presence as well, but theres this overbearing pepper smell that doesnt fit, and I generally like pepper beers but in this case that scent is a bit out of place.  Perhaps its some age of the bottle coming through, some oxidation and staleness.  Thick and vinuous up front, more chewy and oily over the middle and into the finish.  Dark and bitter chocolate is there, as is an unsettling burnt cereal grain flavor, and some smoke that is largely out of place.  Its big, sure, and quite thick, but the flavor of motor oil or tire rubber is not so good. Very astringent and sour in the finish, and I can think of about a half-dozen other imperial stouts Ive had in the last two years that taste quite similar.  I was hoping to really like this one but I guess thats not the case.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1790,"2007-04-23",3.5,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2007 Best By Date June 2007, Sampled March 2007
Pours with a two-finger thick, creamy, light brown colored head.  The beer shows a clear, rich, dark chocolate color as I look at it streaming into my glass, but otherwise it is an opaque black color as it sits in my glass.  Hints of burnt raisin aromatics greet my nose at first and in fact a strong burnt fruit character is very evident in the nose (notes of prune, fig, cherry and rum-like notes as well).  Underlying this burnt fruit character is a dusty chocolate note as well as a hint of burnt grain acidity and some light, yet clearly dark roasted coffee aromatics.  There is a touch of alcohol towards the end (part of that rum aroma) and there also seems to be a touch of green apple here as well.  I really like how this beer projects the aroma of burnt fruit; yes there is lots of char-character, but it reminds me of charred, concentrated fruit and there is still some bright fruit aromatics here as well.

Sweet up front and it still maintains that fruitiness in the flavor as well.  It finishes with a stronger, dusty chocolate note than was in the aroma, which is coupled by lots of toasty malt flavors.  This does not have a whole lot of perceptible hop character; the finish is quite smooth with only a touch of burnt grain derived bitterness.  This beer has been served lightly chilled (58ºF / 14ºC), which seems to accentuate a soft creamy character.  This beer rests with a soft thickness on the palate, it is not syrupy, but is certainly approaching thick and juicy.  Burnt fruit notes of raisins, prunes are most notable, but there are also notes of burnt figs, burnt dried berries and even something evocative of burnt, concentrated tropical fruit (perhaps some charred papaya notes).  This beer is fairly low on roast-derived acidity, in fact the roast malt character is quite a bit less than one would expect from something like a stout.  My guess is that the brewer used a light hand with the darkest most heavily roasted malts.

This is an interesting beer, I dont know if I would want this on a regular basis, but it has certainly shown a  mix / balance of flavors that are not usual for the darker American brews; it is almost something that I would characterize as a fresh English Imperial Stout.  Too bad this is not bottle conditioned, it might have been quite interesting in 20 years.  There is something about this beer that does not allow me to shake the idea that I am drinking burnt prune juice (of course an exaggeration, but still).  In the end this is very interesting, even a bit education, definitely good, but still not quite something I would want a big bottle of (certainly the 12oz format is more than enough, even almost too much).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Smell; lots of dark fruity aromas with plums and cherries. THe roasted aromas are powerful with coffee, dark roasted malts and a bit of sweetness comes out with cocoa and molasses.

Taste; the fruity flavors are first to hit just as the were in the aroma, with plums, cherries and Im also getting some vanilla. Dark roasted coffee mixes very nicely with caramel and cocoa. The finish is very long on this, and provides a bit of a sourness.

Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a very creamy texture, and the drinkability is really good, but not quite outstanding due to the higher abv, and the flavors are so intense I would have a hard time drinking a second one.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

It is also very heavy - even more so than I expected for a Baltic Porter.  There is too much sweetness in the flavor, almost chemically, like aspartame, and this really detracts from the tastiness of the beer for me.  Not as much cocoa as I would have liked, and instead this is replaced by prunes.  The finish is syrupy and heavy.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"

The black beer had a translucent ruby appearance when held to light and a brown head which retreated slowly to lace the glass. The flavor was roasty, toasty and slightly vinous with a fruity aspect and chocolate coupled with coffee. The roast and coffee also came with a caramel backbone and enough bittering to keep the malt presence in check. With a medium full body and a moderate carbonation level the beer exhibited a creamy mouthfeel.

1790,"2007-02-02",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2007 2006 bottle from some ""Old"" guy in North Carolina, drunk on 1/27/07Medium-light tan head is initially large, but recedes rather steadily to partial cover/ring, leaving minimal lacing.  Despite the darkness of the liquid, its clear due to the filtration, with moderate carbonation apparent in it.  Dark mahogany with light maroon hues on the edges.Ive got to say I was not expecting great things from this one, being very unimpressed thus far with their other offerings.  That being said, I went in with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised.  Dusty/grainy cocoa fills the nose, with strong lactic acid and roasted malts combining to produce a clean, vinous effect.  Sweet pale and caramel malts emerge behind this, with warming and theres even a touch of fudge.  Chalky-smooth minerals from either their yeast or water, definitely a house character, are present, but contrasted nicely to a grainy, dry, almost flaked-barley-like flavor.  Chocolate seems to grow stronger and is quite deep and sumptuous, or as much as it can be for being filtered.  The vinousness trails off pleasantly in to the distance, on the finish.  No alcohol vapors and a high strength of aroma finish out this very well-executed aroma.Dry roast and medium-sweet chocolate, growing milky and lactic seem supported by sweet, if somewhat simplified pale/caramel sugars (simplified by filtration).  The carbonation is done very well and could almost be mistaken for natural if I wasnt such a nazi about carbonation and texture.  Attenuation is nearly spot-on, neither too dry nor syrupy-sweet.  And of course the lactic notes.  Two things I think about it.  One, it is very clean and obviously intentionally introduced lactic acid.  It would be fun to see some actual lactobacillus instead.  But two, and more realistically, its done incredibly tastefully and that alone deserves credit.  The level of lactic acid perfectly fits the beer without being dominant.  Very drinkable stuff, but Ill say it again, DR would be world class stuff if they would just lessen their filtration and start bottle conditioning.And in summary, what is a duck-rabbit?My readers wrote in to answer this question.

1790,"2007-01-30",4.3,"The element of greatest surprise was that there wasnt one at all, I knew Duck Rabbit could pull this off after trying five of their other brews before this one. I did not, however, expect this to taste just like I had anticipated, that certainly is a rare occasion. But I had a feeling this would be a juicy and lively porter going into it, possibly with a subtle Americanized twist...nail it they did. This could be mistaken as a smoky, robust porter or a chocolatey imperial stout from Latvia, as it were. Courtesy of Jayg and Rayg1, thank you gentlemen. A dense dark brown head balances atop a jet black viscous body. Retention is subpar but the lacing remaining is thick and plentiful. Large roasted malt dominates the substantial aroma and would turn out to be less roasty in the flavor, more of a balancing agent off-setting hefty sweetness. Also noted in the nose are nuts(cashew, almond), coffee, chocolate, light caramel, vanilla, molasses and dates. Wow, what an aroma! Flavor is no joke either. A skillful blend of bigger chocolate and dark fruits with roast that is substantial but never bothersome. The palate is thick, chewy and at the same time so slick it feels like its sliding down my throat faster than I can manage to swallow it. Mouthfeel is very lively and vibrant. Finishes with a looming alcohol warmth and a bittersweet chocolate composition. Beautiful; this breweries best effort and a testament to the skill of the brewer.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

The taste starts fruity and heavy on the malty sweetness with a backing of black liquorice candy. The midesection display of note of coffee bitterness along with a dash of some spicy hops. The finish is smoky (and even a touch peaty) and yeasty with a moderate note of alcohol warming.  The mouth feel is oily and surprisingly tingly and sprite.

1790,"2007-01-21",4.0,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Pours an even dark walnut color with some mahogany fringes and a head of foamy roast.  Rich, succulent aromas of dark chocolate are backed by a generous serving of dark fruits.  A plethora of raisins and prunes provide a caramel-sticky like aromatic texture with a bit of vanilla and a subtle dose of alcohols that walks on the border of a toasty wood usage.  Some suggestions of prune and a light black pepper spice float by.  Full bodied, soothing carbonation mouthfeel.  Much drier palate than I was expecting from the aroma, as the roasty characters seem to dominate the palate much more than the fruity characters found in the aroma.  Dark chocolate and an oily roast coffee leap out at first, and while satisfying, they arent nearly as rich my expectations.  Some deeper digging reveals some molasses tones  and an unsalted, lightly smoked shredded beef jerky, but not too meaty.

1790,"2007-01-06",4.0,"1/5/07.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, obtained in SecretSanta exchange on RateBeer 12/6/06.  Dark black-brown in color, utterly opaque with a mostly-dense, medium-sized, brown-tan head.  Peppered with tiny black bits of small-but-persistent bubbles and blotches of sudsier, rocky bubbles, the head seems to grow lighter in color a bit after the initial pour.  Finely-beaded lacing undergoes a similar shift to more mundane activity after its early displays of elegance.  Aroma climbs out of the bottle when I first open it; dense layers of bakers chocolate, dry roast, some sort of lighter-chocolate toffee/nougat candies, hints of cherry and a distinct (and not entirely welcome) grapey lactic acidity.  That last component is not entirely bad, but its a bit scary in its nearly-overwhelming prominence for me.  Flavor is big and similarly complex, with a lot of wine-soaked chocolate cakey affectation (key word here being ""affectation"").  Theres some roasted char and dry chocolate to accompany the vinous elements, but I specifically DONT get any cherry cordial.  More distinctly reminiscent of that earlier grapeyness.  Detectable-but-not-overwhelming alcohol presence.  No suggestion of higher alcohols at all, but theres a bit of a kick there that glides along with some woody-roasty vinous notes.  Finish is alarmingly complex with bold flavors emerging and then shrinking back into the shadows-- cocoa powder, milky-woody crispness, even something like earthy/earthenware toasted nuts.  (Earthenware-- what a pretentious term to use when describing a beer, but I couldnt shake it as I wrote this, so hopefully someone will know what the hell Im picking out by virtue of my leaving that here.)  Theres a separate kind of earthy, almost mushroomy flavor that wraps around the whole array.  Gently scrubby mouthfeel that feels at times fluffy and smooth, other times almost fizzy and tingling.  Theres a drying, wood-like acidity at work too, almost like the ashy bite of a swig of water with a cigarette butt in it (sad to say, I actually know what this is like).  But this swig is pleasant.  Some beautiful tobacco notes that are pretty deep in the background, but theyre unmistakable to me.  I bet this would be great with a cigar.  A substantial problem I have is that the gas appears to be escaping from this beer quite quickly; this makes for an experience in constant flux (which can certainly be seen as a good thing, for the most part)-- in aroma, flavor, everything.  But the mouthfeel is simply devolving.  I cant say Im in love, but the sheer density and breadth of flavors going on here is something that must be commended.  Too bad I didnt entirely enjoy all of them.  One of those great beers that reminds me of how subjective a lot of the experience is-- for another palate Im sure this is a mind-blowingly perfect creation.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

1790,"2007-01-04",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 29, 2009 1/04/2007:  I received a few bottles of The Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter through a trade from kenb.  Thanks Ken! -- 

Let me start by saying that this is a truly great beer and is rich and complex in flavor.  The flavor is wonderful and almost diffucult to even describe.  All of that being said, here is my attempt to record some of my thoughts and observations of this beer...  Color is black with a large, creamy  brown head.  The aroma reminds me of a well-aged port.  The flavor is also has many port-like flavors as well as some creamy vanilla, chocolate, lightly roasted coffee, and a hint of candied anise.  There is just the right amount of dark chocolate bitterness in the finish to balance everything out nicely.  The alcohol is barely detectable until the beer warms up some.  This beer is full bodied and rich creamy, and smooth on the palate.  Overall this is one of the best porters I have had.  Worth seeking out and savoring very slowly!

2007 Vintage
8/29/2009:  The Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter...  Aroma:  Dark chocolate; hints of char, smoke, and licorice; very deep red wine/dark fruit notes.  Appearance:  Dark chocolate color/near black with a dense and lasting brown-colored head.  Flavor:  Very much like the aroma; more red wine and port than I remember from before; lots of chocolate; vanilla; espresso; cocoa.  Palate:  Medium to medium-full body; smooth and creamy; milky.  Overall:  Many say that this beer does not age well, but I completely disagree.  I think that only the mouthfeel has suffered very slightly.  The flavor may not be quite as rich or complex, but it is still extremely tasty and worthy of slow enjoyment!

Pleasantly sweet and malty. Flavor has notes of dark chocolate, sweet caramel, cherry, dark fruit/figs, molasses, red wine, some bitter roastiness and lactic sourness at the end. I detected somewhat of an herbal hop note in there as well. Pretty complex. Alcohol character is present but very smooth. Creamy and lush on the palate with subtle, fine-beaded carbonation.

The head was minimal, but this thing wasnt flat. The lacing wasnt impressive. But, heck, forget all that appearance stuff, this thing smelled delicious, nice dark fruits, very light coffee, and a smokey finish. The flavor was splendid, all of that aroma, a gentle sweetness to make this a great finish for the night, figgy, licorice, some chocolate also making an appearance. Only slight knock was the degree of sweetness, a tad too much to take away from any lager crispness. Mouthfeel was smooth, medium carbonation, thick.","","User37895"

Nestle bakers chocolate meets some lactic persuasions and joins forces with locked espresso grinds clinging to caphalon. Sweet cream and souring French silk pie pipe in with their scents as well. Sugary, chocolaty milk cream comes in, pooling thickly like 2 percent milk. Chewy stream of tightly charred chocolate bricks enchants the special territory assigned to it. Hints of smoked coffee gaskets come about, and then melting Hersheys bittered chocolate baking squares blanket the base.

Thanks to The_Epeeist for sending these for a tasting.  I brought them along and popped them open at the close of the night.  It was a good way to finish the tasting.  Despite a few others opening things, my stomach could not handle any more.  25 beers in a night is quite a few, especially when they are of the caliber of everything we tasted.  I would call this one a Top 100 but not quite Top 50.  Perhaps it was the combination of everything else I tried but this was missing a little something.  Still, kudos to the Duck Rabbit for an awesome beer.
Flavor / Palate - The body was deep black with an off white tannish head one finger high.  It was so dark that almost no light escaped the glass.  It was almost a black hole worthy of comparison to Expedition or Dark Lord.  Aromas of smoke, cherries, malt, peaches and toffee formed an intruiging nose.  Overall it was airy and vinous but still focused.
Flavor / Palate - Coffee and cajun blackened malt form a smoky mouthfeel.  Roasted malt and dark chocolate create a nice followup which is then succeeded by smoke, cherry and salt free pretzels.  The body was very complex and pleasing but hot quite all there.  I couldnt pin down what was missing but it just felt slightly off.  It is on par with the Full Sail Imperial Porter though which is not a bad beer.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Really hits the style very well-lots of sweetness, but lots of choclate with light roast to dry it out a little.  nice complexity!  Body is full with very subtle and gentle carbonation.

There is a slighty fishiness that I usually see in wheat coming through that is a turn off to me.  The description is right on with the velvety aspect on the mouthfeel.

Oily, smooth body revealing layers of chocolate, toffee, toasted marshmallow, soy, and even prune.  Salty, leathery palate.  Absolutely perfect finish on the back of the tongue, where burnt residual sugars and leathery notes linger long after the sip, just out of reach of the full array of tastebuds.

Flavor is similar but much bolder; bitter dark chocolate, roses, copper, hazelnut. Gets almost a little sour in the back of your throat before the chocolate nutty aftertaste kicks in, which may or may not be indicative of the alcohol content. Actually, this beer would probably taste better with a bit less alcohol. The mouth feel is incredible here, like buttermilk, very thick, though it does stick to your throat a bit. Very interesting, but really, does every beer out of a micro in NC have to be high gravity? I feel like the flavor suffers for 3% more alcohol.

Full bodied, silky mouthfeel and coating to the tongue and palate.  Roasted and ever so slight acrid malt flavors, a touch of  sourness that persists but doesnt become obnoxious.

1790,"2006-11-02",4.5,"Huge thanks to Ross for sending 3 of these babies!  First of all, let me say that I was a huge fan of Duck Rabbit before it was cool and in vogue to be a fan of Duck Rabbit.  I knew they were capable of a beer like this; it was just a matter of time.  The Rabid Duck was great, but this one is a knockout!  The pour is jet black with a 1-finger brown head.  In fact, this is the brownest head Ive seen since my last frat party at Mississippi State University.  The aroma is roasty malty, very chocolatey, with a sweet molasses, black pepper, and slight smoky oaky element.  Complex aroma.  The taste is dense, complex, and rich on the palate...very velvety, with tastes of roasty malt, molasses, black peppery celeryish notes, and some coffee and slight rauchy hints.  As it warms, it gets richer and more chocolatey, but the taste is never as sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe.  Very well hidden alcohol.  This one is damned good, and definitely worthy of top 50 status!  Get ya some if you can.

Flavor has lots of chocolate, roastiness, nuttiness, with some hints of vanilla up front.  Moderate plum fruitiness leads towards a finish with some light roasted coffee and burnt flavors.

1790,"2006-10-29",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2010 Bottle, rating #700. Man, have I been patiently waiting for this.Two things Ive been thinking: 1.)Their imperial stout is awesome, 2.) Their regular porter is awesome. So. . . Pours black and thick, some ruby hues are noted in the light. Lacing is dense and oily on the side of the goblet and no head remains after about 3 or 4 minutes. The aroma is heavily roasted with earthy coffee notes, caramel, pipe smoke, baking chocolate. Smells rather American, it doesnt quite have the aroma found on a typical, textbook Baltic. Ah, the flavor. This is where the beer truly excels. It is somewhat Americanized, but the finish has enough mildly sour, pleasingly bitter ashiness to make me realize this is no imperial stout. The initial palate coating delivers flavors of espresso, dark chocolate, hickory, wood-notes. Things become a bit more tart in the finish, notes of tobacco and plums are noticed along with a dash of soy sauce and mildly acidic coffee. Hints of toffee swim around. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy with low carbonation, really slick. This is damn good stuff.

Six pack from Hop City. I hear they may be discontinuing this beer so I figured I better try it again while I can. Ive thought that even though this is an amazing beer it is a bit overrated. Now we shall see once again. The pour is very attractive with its very dark, near black, red color. The head builds up but quickly disappears to a small ring. The aroma is heftily roasty with some lactose qualities, faint fruity tones, coffee and a distinct nutty hint. The palate is medium heavy. What a weird tasting beer. Ive always thought Duck Rabbit makes beers that are unique in the way of yeast. The initial flavor is soy sauce, coffee, meat, and typical porter flavors but a second later and Im thinking plums, coconut, buttermilk, and sugar cookies. It is a most unique big black beer and I enjoy it well. That said, I probably dig their imperial stout more.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

1790,"2006-10-17",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2008 Bottle from original release sampled on 4/6/08:  This ones been in the cellar for about a year and a half.

Otherwise finishes bittersweet and lightly roasted.

Fall 2007 release sampled on 12/29/07: Similar appearance as the previous year, but the aroma is quite vinous and tart.  Body follows suit with some mild sweetness, but the unintended? sourness seems out of place and is a big turn off for me.

Medium bodied and creamy on the palate, sweet chocolate flavors are the first to come across with just a little bit of coffee and bready flavors before going into this small hint of dark and sour fruit that almost goes unnoticed and thus barely makes this a baltic porter.

Roasty malt and dark chocolate nose, earthy, an odd fruity note. Flavor is semisweet chocolate, a little roasty coffee, and sweet malt that penetrates the deep parts of the mouth. While damn tasty, the star here is the body - not quite creamy, but the consistancy of half-n-half; dense, but not too thick. Smooth as wet ice on ice. Mildly dry chalkiness in the center of the tongue in the finish, while the sweet malt flavors tickle the sides of your tongue. Simply awesome.

1790,"2006-10-12",4.4,"Thanks to Old Growth for the opportunity to try this. I love the philosophical identity of the Duck-Rabbit brewery. I think philosophy and beer go very well together. Ample dark roasted flavors and malty sweetness rise asymptotically towards an axis of pleasing sourness. Sometimes you drink a beer and you can tell a lot of thought and time went into its creation. The flavors work so well together you wouldnt know that brewing involves unknown variables. Not as euphoric as the Perkunos Hammer I had on tap at the Falling Rock post GABF one year, but excellent nonetheless.","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"

Malt flavors were intense yet pleasant at the same time. Rich, dark chocolate, fresh-baked bread, virgin earth, and a warm, soft roast (that was curiously scorched as well). Bitterness followed through gently and balanced. An even sourness surfaced and settled the minor disputes and leveled everything out tremendously well.

Aroma is a heavy roasty smell that makes your mouth water. Taste is of coffee and dark chocolate at first but then you start to hit some hoppy flavors finishing with a light fruity flavor and a touch of sugar. Amazing beer talked to the guy from Duck-Rabbit about it for 20 minutes or so. He told me that they are very proud of this beer (and they should be) and that they have recieved much more positive feedback then expected, this of course is a seasonal and was only released a few weeks ago.

I wanted it to be better than I it was when I first had it, because I love Duck-Rabbit....but folks this is just a decent Imperial Stout...its not a Baltic Porter and there are better Imperial Stouts out there.

Original Rating also was 3.6

Draft at GABF. I drank damn near a pint of this trying to figure out what all the fuss was about. Its a good beer, but not much of a Baltic Porter: Chocolate, esspresso, Dark Bakers chocolate and while those are all well represented and concentrated they are more Imperial stouts aromas...didnt get any raisin, perfumey alcohol or dark fruit notes I expect from a BP. Deep black body with a firm mocha head that is lasting. Esspresso, dark chocolate, burnt malt, chalky cocoa and finally some faint burnt raisin notes, but not enough to define the style. Its simply an Imperial Stout and a decent low abv one, but not a Baltic Porter. Its good yes, but Im still faulting it for getting my hopes up for a BP from a great brewery and not giving me one.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"
1790,"2006-10-02",4.2,"Bottle. Thx Turd for the trade.  Aroma roasty, cocoa,coffee.  Poured an almost black with a red chocolate head.  Flavor was a nice blend, coffee,chocolate, smoke and a tad of fruit.  Palate was nice and creamy but not overly thick. Overall, very well done.","Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA","Firemoose15"
1790,"2006-10-02",4.1,"Bottle. Pours dark black. Very light traces of brown in the light. The head is thin and brown, and it dissipates rather quickly. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, a bit of roast, and some alcohol. Flavor is more complex, smooth chocolate at first, with hints of a dark fruit flavor, followed by coffee, and finishing with a different darker, slightly bitter chocolate, and a nice warmth from the alcohol. The mouthfeel is huge and chewy throughout, and the finish lingers forever.","Sevierville, Tennessee, USA","muenster"
1790,"2006-10-02",4.5,"GABF 2006.  Deep black color, tan head.  Aroma is hugely complex - chocolate, licorice, light alcohol.  Flavor has layers of complexity - chocolate, licorice, hints of sour, some alcohol.  Very creamy mouthfeel.  Medium body.  Overall, an awesome beer....lots of complexity, fantastic.  Probably my favorite beer of the festival.","OFallon, Missouri, USA","jimvy"
1790,"2006-10-02",4.2,"Jet black pour thick tan head well laced.  Light coffee nice roast malt aroma quite dry.  Palate was thick creamy and well coated.  Flavor is nice butter toffee light coffee notes roasted malts a touch of tobaco, nicely complex.  Very good but I hear probably not really a true baltic.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
1790,"2006-10-02",4.2,"GABF 2006.  Pours to a dark black/brown body with a light brown head.  The aroma is dark chocolate, dry roastyness, coffee.

I had a glass of this at Mikes place.  I still find this to be not nearly as good as some of the true baltics.  No adjustment to the score.


Several samples at the GABF 06.  Dark brown with some reddish highlights.  Chocolate roast and coffee in the aroma.  The flavor certainly had some raost character, but there was also some wierd soapy character.   Medium to full body.  Did not live up to expectations.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
1790,"2006-09-30",4.8,"WOW!  I am floored.  This thing is wonderful.  Aroma is high in malts and caramel.  Flavor is something to savor.  It is very malty with a nice sweet finish.  Alcohol is niclely hidden.  Outstanding job on this brew.","Greensboro, North Carolina, USA","00cobraR"
1790,"2006-09-30",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2006 Ross sent this to me out of his own generosity. Thanks Ross, you are not a dick after all! Pours a viscous motor oil black, with a deep plummy brown head. Aroma is very upfront of dark chocolate and mild roast coffee. Mouthfeel is velvety, medium light carbonation. Flavor is very well rounded, with notes of bakers chocolate, dark roast, coffee. Finish has a subtle hop bitterness along with plums. Alcohol is very well hidden, and is only detectable at room temp. This is REAL good when it warms. I would put this up there with Bells Expedition, Siberian Night, Dark Lord, etc. as far as my favorite dark high ABV beers. I enjoyed all 12 ounces of it. In the top 50, and I can see why. And guess what? Its not barrel aged, unfiltered, in 750ml bottles, etc. You NC ratebeerians should be proud.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"
1790,"2006-09-30",4.4,"Sampled at Brewgrass Fest.  Color was more or less black, with a thin, wispy brown head.  Aroma was rich and sweet with a hint of roasted coffee.  Flavor was of rich, heavy, smooth malts.  Me likey very much!","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","Quixote18"
1790,"2006-09-29",4.8,"Beautiful, sweet, coffee, dried fruit, mild alcohol, complex aroma.  Pour is dark brown, slight light brown head.  My sweet lord, flavor is awesome.  No flaws, and terribly complex.  Roasty, chocolate, some sweetness, dried fruit.  Alcohol is hidden quite well.  Medium to full body.  This is the bomb, pretty much flawless, perfectly balanced yet comples.  Im gonna go buy a lot and send it to all of my friends.  Yum.","Echo Park, California, USA","505"
1790,"2006-09-28",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2009 12 oz bottle via TURDFERGUSON (thanks!). Pours a midnight black with a small tan head. Aroma is roasty/burnt with notes of anise, acetone, chocolate and coffee.  Flavors start out with some sweet molsasses, subtle plums and  cherries and then turn to some bitter chocolate before ending with some alcohol, butterscocth and yummy burnt coffee. This is closer to what I think a Baltic should be than several of the real from the area Baltics i have recently tried. This is sort of a cross between a Zywiec and a Koff Porter but IS unique.. in otherwords  perfect as a great craft beer and perfect for the style...10/27/06 re-rate...well i have had a few more of these in the past few weeks, and while it is still a great brew....it is far from a perfect beer as it does have a couple off flavors in with all the good stuff.....ratings going from a 5 to a respectable 4.6...","Oregon, USA","kenb"
1790,"2006-09-26",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 6, 2006 Trade courtesy of TurdFerguson.  (Tasted directly after a Koff Porter, to normalize things a bit.)  Pours a beautiful, big-bubbled head; decent retention and attractive lacing; a pitch-black core with a slight amount of translucent brown along the edges.  Huge nose, showing plenty of dark chocolate and coffee, some charred malt and vanilla notes.  The mouthfeel is medium-to-heavy; slightly viscous but not completely full; milk chocolate, smoke, roasted malts, marshmallow, and even slightly vegetal, which doesnt serve to detract.  Ends with a medium finish: plenty of chocolate, vegetal, and smoky aspects.  Very interesting, well-handled brew out of North Carolina.  Thanks, Sam!  ...  Rerate 10/6: Upped the appearance by a point; beautiful head, well-retained.  Huge amounts of peanuts noticed this time around, in both the nose and palette.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
1790,"2006-09-25",3.0,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2009 12 oz bottle.  Got some at peabodys today.  Mega thanks to Brandon for saving me a couple of cases.  I was unable to get it in charlotte yet because my regular guy was out of town until this week.  Man it was wroth the wait.  Pours out very dark with a big brown head on it.   Smell is heavy on the roasted malts and coffee with some chocolate added in.  Taste is awesome.  Smooth, rich, like eating a chocolate filled coffee bar.  There is no alcohol even noted in this beer.  The best baltic porter I have ever had, hands down, and easily the best brewed beer that NC has ever seen.  This is a fuckin awesome porter. 9/5/10/5/18

man, im drinking another bottle of this right now, and i really have to give it another 10th of a point on the overall, it is really really good. easily in my top 10 most favorite beers.

Update - this new beer is terrible.  The previous years are very good but the new batch is virtually undrinkable.  Yuck.  Ratings changed to reflect this.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"
1790,"2006-09-25",4.4,"12 oz. bottle. Big brown frothy head develops from an inky black pour, then settles to a thin brown ring over 5-8 minutes.  Aromas of roasted grain, earth, a little dark fruit, and some spice add up to an intriguing opening. Rich and smooth on the palate that is both chewy and slightly resinous, just a fantastic mouthfeel. Flavor is intitially sweet with burnt sugar and dark cherry. Balance is provided by the bitterness of dark roasted coffee and some peppery spice.  A lingering bitter finish completes the experience. Theyve hit a home run with this one.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"
1790,"2006-09-25",4.4,"Black, tan head. Sweetish, prune and raisin aroma, with some spicy notes as well. Big prune and raisin, with hints of fig, too maybe? Nice background notes of coffee and chocolate that combine nicely with fruitier notes. Very, very tasty. Sampled at Asheville Brewgrass, 2006.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
1790,"2006-09-21",4.3,"Pitch Black appearance with minimal brown head.  Aroma of milk chocolate and faint cookie?  Incredibly earthy flavor that is sour at first with a strong toffee character accompanied with rich molasses. Very well structed and perfectly balanced.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","brownaler"
1790,"2006-09-21",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2006 Bottle, from Whole Foods/Raleigh. though I later picked up a case at Sams in Durham. Real good nose, bittersweet. Roasty. Bitter chocolate, coffee, Dried fruit (plum, date), Little compost, little yeasty nuttiness. Got a little bit of a rubbing alcohol scent in the aroma. Dark brownish black color, small brown head that faded quickly to nothing, little to no lace. Bittersweet flavor, like aroma with  the chocolate, coffee being prominent. You also get a toffee/caramel and toasted grain flavor too. Wouldnt of guessed  9% Abv. Thick body, viscous oily creamy mouthfeel, bitter dryish finish. Delicious. Wonderful brew. As an additional note Ive never got the aroma I called rubbing alcohol so Im suspecting my glass at the time, when I was in corporate housing and it was a glass that had been cleaned in a dishwasher with some kind of powder I wouldnt of used myself.","the Containment Area, North Carolina, USA","OldGrowth"
1790,"2006-09-17",4.8,"I had this beer for the first time last night in Greenville (GVegas) at Christys Europub (just a few miles from Farmville where the beer is made).  I got to say I was blown away. Very dark, very thick beer which to me had a strong aroma and flavor of good ol North Carolina blackstrap molasses!  Wonderful beer.  I cant wait to get some more.","Greenville, North Carolina, USA","GVegasBrewer"
1790,"2006-09-17",4.8,"12 oz bottle:   pours anthracite black with a beautiful dark khaki head.  my god the aroma is amazing.  the intilal aroma is coffee, sweet creamy chocolatey rich mocha coffee, not over powering.  very sensual.hints of carramel vanilla and dark fruit peek though.   flavors of of coffee and mocha.  vanilla dark fruit caramel, beautiful.  silky smooth in the mouth.  carbonation is perfect.  its very hard to believe this beer is 9 percent abv, very well hidden.  all i can say is wow.  duck rabbit has outdone itself.  i had this on draft about a month ago at the saucer and was like this its pretty good but now as i sit here savoring it fropm the bottle i realize that it is more than pretty good, its amazing.","West Chester, Ohio, USA","tobias"
1790,"2006-09-16",4.5,"Bottle. Oh man Ive been waiting for this one. Pours a deep ebony with a bit of garnet only at the thinnest extremities, and a puffy reddish brown head. Oh wow, this smells delicious. Espresso dominates the nose, accompanied by a lot of fig and caramel, and hints of chocolate and smoke and maybe a bit of blackberry. The taste is incredibly rich. Sweet chocolate, espresso, some raisin, and a few vinous notes hit the mouth first. Then comes a woody bitterness mixed with some faint earthy hops. Toward the finish comes a flavor of toasted nuts, cashews and almonds, perhaps. A vaguely warming aftertaste is the only hint that there is so much alcohol. Im amazed that a beer this big can be so delicate. A complex and impressive brew. They have raised the bar for NC brewing.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"
1790,"2006-09-16",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2008 As far as the love thing goes, Magjayran will have some competition.  What a glorious brew.  I was expecting a watered down porter with an alcoholic bite.  What I got was a rich mahogany head with a beautiful cold coffee and licorice nose.  A slight buttery toffee hides behind black mission figs, toasted pecan, espresso, and maybe some leather as well?  Impeccable balance and poise as the 9% doesn’t seem to answer the phone even though it’s certainly at home.  The smooth refreshment found mid-palate says porter, the roasted finish whispers for another sip.  Dark Beer Specialists indeed.

2007 Batch.  I can understand the gripes about this being an ale porter and not a lager porter.  Historically I think that can be considered correct based off the original versions sent to the Baltic States rather than the style in spurned there.  Nonetheless, this stuff is amazing aged and fresh.  Looking over my notes from last year I still feel the same way.  Although I do think the cocoa powder and  the espresso notes are a little more prevalent.  Maybe I’m just remembering an older bottle.  Outstanding.","Charleston, USA","Bigsilky"
1790,"2006-09-12",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2009 Its finally here!!! Pours an oily black with just the tiniest bit of light showing through. Its got a nice little chocolate head sitting on top. The aroma is full of roasted malts giving a strong mocha impression. Theres nothing in the aroma at all to give the impression of high alcohol. The flavor is deliciously rich with a extremely satisfying blast of sweet chocolate with a slight hint of coffee roastiness. Im in love with this shit. It seems like DR made not enough Impy Stout, a tad too much Wee Heavy, and possibly not nearly enough of this Baltic-Porter. If I were to have one beef with this beer it would be that it definitely seems to be much more of the new style American Imperial Porters and not so much of the European Baltic Porter style. In the end that means nothing since this is absolutely the best NC beer Ive ever had.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"
