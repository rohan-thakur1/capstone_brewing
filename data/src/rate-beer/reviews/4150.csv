Near purple. People were excited when the first two kicked and this came on. It did a good approximation of a honey drizzled pbj sandwhich, but was juuust a touch too over the top for me.

4150,"2016-10-27",4.3,"From notes. Enjoyed at Corbets house during a tasting on October 17. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a nice deep ruby color, really clear, with no head and no lace accordingly. The aroma is really good. There is a light peanut butter, an excellent blackberry or blueberry jam, and a lightly spicy honey. You can even smell the bread on this damn thing. Its like youre getting a nice PB&J on toasted wheat bread with a light alcohol finally coming in as it warms. The flavor is just as good. The peanut butter isnt thick and heavy, but light and flavorful. The jamminess of the berries is definitely in there and absolutely lovely. The honey and a light alcohol once again poke through on the end .The mouth feel is light and syrupy without any carbonation. Its a little thin for sure. The aftertaste is lingeringly bready and a beautiful peanut butter and preserves on the back end. This is really fucking good. Just wish it was a little thicker.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

4150,"2016-10-05",4.2,"From bottle thanks alot to LukasMH! Pours a deep vinous ruby red clear. Aroma has strong fruit vinous notes, tannic, strawberry, cherries, blueberry, weak spicy honey, not much peanut in the aroma though. Hmm.. Taste is pretty tart, again vinous tannic, obviously a high sugar content, but strong acidic notes dominates the taste. Maybe a slight nutty bitter/dry finish, leading to a weird, oxidised, syrup-covered cheesy note in the far after taste. If i didnt know any better i would have guessed this to be a port or cherry wine, lol. Super nice oily texture! Good, but not close to the last many superstitions ive had.","Aarhus C, DENMARK","Vestergaard"

4150,"2016-03-13",4.5,"Im blown away by what these guys create in meads. The aroma and palate are just like the name implies. Its straight peanut butter and blueberry jelly. This needs to be done in its own series with strawberries and raspberries. The only thing from making this one of my favorites meads, from Superstition, is the blueberries. Change it to strawberry, and this may be my favorite mead.","Arizona, USA","kcorum10"
