They poured this into a tulip.
The appearance was a glossy burnt yellow to hazy blonde color. Messy sticky lacing around the sides of the glass.
The aroma takes on sweet grassy sticky hops with a nice underlying bitterness all about. Citrus rind. Then a nice crisp sweet malt.
The flavor brings it all together bittersweet. Nice underlying bittersweet citrus rind. Sly grassy to citrus sweet aftertaste with a crisp bittersweet finish.

Amazingly, the simcoe add no pine/cherry and just a touch of juicy grapefruit. Amarillo add woodsy and softly citric character while motueka adds its very similar character (leafy, green, lightly vegetal, soft citrus and nectarine). Crackers and whitebread in the background stay out of the way of the hops which continue to crescendo with warming and breathing, eventually ending with juicy nectarine, peach and lemon, and a light smattering of honey.Incredibly dry (but with an ample, malty texture and tight carbonation) in the flavor with a bare cracker-like maltiness. Hops are incredibly well-controlled adding only modest bitterness and absolutely no resin. Hints of key lime and grapefruit rind are the extent, with plentiful yellow fruit and woody, leafy, vegetal (not spoiled vegetal, but a good vegetal. Like fresh, live, vibrant vegetation).

Hazy with a white head. Yellow/orange body. Very wispy.

Smells of grapefruit hops, just like Life without Principle #1, but more of an earthy pine hop presence. Pale malt is also more prevalent, which is strange considering this should be less malty.

Taste is grapefruit hops and that same touch of earthy pine. More pale malts again than its other blonde cohort. Even a touch of bitterness to this one.

Light, more body and bitterness than Life without Principle #1, which I donÂ’t get. Not quite as easy to drink, though.

Bright, translucent, lemony yellow with a sudsy white head that leaves heavy rings of lace down the glass. Aroma is freshness in a glass-- delicate fresh hops that display characteristics in equal proportion of both crisp, green grassy notes and ripe rind of citrus. Light, biscuit malts support a vibrant but delicate hoppy body, notes of carrot tops, kumquat, guava, and honeydew, leading to a crisp finish of just-right balancing bitterness.

Nose is beautiful sweet cream butter (Hill Farmstead house yeast), soft butterscotch, peaches&cream ice cream, juicy cantaloupe, whipped cream. As it warms, a flash of exotic/pithy tropical melon comes through (Motueka I assume). Taste is juicy, rich butterscotch is a flavor but not a density. Floats on the tongue with mega buoyancy. Super soft bitterness is not the main character here- juicy hops and tropical fruit are 90% with the remaining a soft bitterness. Soft and refreshing rather than abusive. Slick, soft butteriness on the palate is exactly what I am after. A big improvement over tannic astringency or chemical soap. Exactly the APA I was hoping this would be and much more. A perfect hop combo of some of my favorites, especially Amarillo. Wow. This is the entire purpose of the APA style- delicacy, bright hoppiness, refreshing body unlike IPAs which are bitter for no reason and heavy in mouthfeel.

3336,"2012-11-27",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2013 In short: A wicked hoppy-but-not-bitter aromatic low-abv blonde ale.  Fantastic thirst beer.
How: Tap at the brewery, then a full growler the day after, then another full growler the day after the day after.  I guess I loved that beer.
The look: Cloudy yellow topped by a small white head.
In long: The highly aromatic nose has pale garden glowers, fresh lemongrass, some bananas, grapefruits, more...  Tastes is a slice of freshly baked bread, a few slices of smooth not-yet-ripe yellow bananas, freshly cut lemongrass, some dough, citrus fruits, light piney notes and even a bit of a rustic thing going on.  Becomes more and more grassy (sun dried yellowed grass) the more I dink the beer with some tart grapefruits.  Bitterness level in the low-medium range and there is a light refreshing tartness.  Finish is rather dry and grassy.  Just as good as Lawsons Three Penny Especiale that was launched a few months before Walden and only a few miles away from Hill Farmstead and Alchemist, and these two are my now my two best low abv pale ales.  Summer was good in Vermont for low abv hoppy thirst beer lovers.  Another beer IÂ’d drink every day, I drink so much beer now that I am prescribed pills to help with my failing kidneys and it says Â“take with plenty of fluidsÂ” and Â“do not take with alcoholÂ” and I have no idea what to do.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

And yet. September 1, 2012.

Pours a cloudy canary yellow with one finger of white head. The bubbles accumulate in the middle of the glass, forming something like a small hill of elevated head.

Clean citrus sweetness, citrus pith, tropical fruit sweetness, faintly grassy, with some light biscuit malt character. Very aromatic, highlighting the lemony citrus.

Soft maltinessÂ—biscuity, wheatyÂ—with some of the same clean citrus found on the nose. Just a hint of earthy bitterness on the finish, but without any real bitter bite, thankfully. Juicy melon.

Nose holds stunning notes of of pineapple and mango tropical fruits as well as citrus sweetness and touches of spruce and dank earthy loam. Flavor adds lemongrass and white grapefruit to broaden the fruit melange. A nice bitter finish but delectably drinkable. So amazingly flavorful for 4 percent. An incredible collaboration brew.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
3336,"2012-08-09",4.3,"2L Growler. Pale hazy yellow, decent head that recedes quickly. Aroma of oranges, citrus peel, resinous hops and white flowers. Very aromatic. High lemon tartness blends wonderfully with leafy hops and citruz zest bitterness. Light bodied and dry finish makes it highly drinkable. I really like the actual summer beer trend. It reminds me of DDC Wallonade or TDD Traction ale with Hill Farmstead quality standards. This is a great preamble to the very promising low abv, high citrus series.","Trois-RiviÃ¨res, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
3336,"2012-08-07",4.0,"32oz growler, fresh, from a good friend.  thank you... pours a semi-hazy, wheat beer like pale yellow brown hue, consistent throughout, and topped with a ore than adequate fluffy frothy white head that eventually reduces down to a milky film.... firm grapefruit and citrus focused nose.  a fair bit juicy to boot which enhances the aroma more ... flavors are not absurdly hop dominated, held in check, but still a very integral factor into the entire equation.  crisp with lemon citrusy zest and a biscuity malt and pale grain backing.  both work well in harmony with each other.  quite a bit a flavor packed into such a small brew with 40 ibus overall.  lighter bodied, refreshing hoppy goodness without being overdone and perfectly quenching.  a touch of bitterness on the backend to provide an additional aspect while offering a touch of dryness to boot...really hoping the small session beer movement continues to see its deserved attention.  i would love to have this at my disposal throughout the year, and not only during the summer months.  an anytime type of brew.  well crafted and executed.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
3336,"2012-07-31",3.6,"On tap at Prohibition Pig and a sample at the Vermont Beer Festival. Pale yellow with generous white head. Mild grains, lemon and some mixed citrus, light malt, some herbs. High carbonation, mild but flavourful body, little sour but more bitter, becomes sweet on the finish, also quite dry with a nice hit of lemon zest and rosemary. Very easy to drink.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"
3336,"2012-07-30",4.0,"This is probably the best beer IÂ’ve ever had thatÂ’s this low in alcohol. Pours cloudy yellow with good lacing. Smells like hay and dirty farm hops. A little bit bitter, a little grassy. Very full palate. On tap at Farmhouse Tap and Grill.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
3336,"2012-07-27",3.9,"Thanks to yourefragile for sharing the growler.  Served in Hill Farmstead stemware.  Pours a very pale straw color with a really nice white head and plenty of lacing.  Nose has nice lemon and a touch of citrus. Intense. Flavor more subdued. Light grain. Fairly bitter and quite dry.  Really drinkable.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"

3336,"2012-07-25",4.4,"pours a light golden straw color with a fluffy head that leaves lacing as it falls. blast of hops a first but delicate and herbally sweet smell. soft maltiness and clean mellow yeast esters. taste has a blast of hops but the flavor is delicate mild herbally sweet hops and a gentle bready malt. a perfectly balanced beer it seems. dry bitter with a touch of sweetness. no alcohol detected except after i finished the growler. o__O","New Jersey, USA","fbm115"
3336,"2012-07-25",4.6,"On tap at my house. Hazy golden-straw in appearance with a robust long lasting white frothy head. The aroma holds a variety of hop facets, each of which plays very nicely with the others. Dank piney herbals lead to juicy nectar fruit and vibrant tropical fruit. Very fresh and bright, capturing the individual hop character of each respective variety, while simultaneously providing a union that is more delicious than the constitutive parts. The body of the beer is quite full given the abv, even to the point of drinking like a light bodied ipa. There are literally no major flavors to obstruct the hops, which is amazing if youÂ’re into that sort of thing. Caressing pillowy carbonation provides excellent texture, while the finish remains very dry and crisp. With all the super extreme styles being brewed these days, this provides an amazingly welcoming experience. I wish more brewers undertook refinement of low alcohol beer, as it truly is among the most difficult style to do exquisitely well. HatÂ’s off to this collaboration, for it certainly accomplishes that goal.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
3336,"2012-07-24",4.3,"Resin and citrus aromas aplenty.
Minimal head, hazy straw color.
Thin body with medium carbonation.
Smells like hops, tastes like hops.Backed by light maltiness.
Overall a super hoppy pale ale that is super refreshing and easy to drink(for a hophead).
Great beer.","Laval, Quebec, CANADA","lalu"
