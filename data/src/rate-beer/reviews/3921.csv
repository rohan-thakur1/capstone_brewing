3921,"2016-05-26",2.9,"12fl oz bottle poured into an English pint. Clear sparkling gold with a modest white head. Fruity aroma. Flavor is a blast of sour. 

Holy crap! I almost spit this out. My girlfriend poured this for me for a blind rate. I was not expecting that. Still, even after several sips, its incredibly sour. I didnt like this at first but it grew on me. Not a bad Berliner- never thought i would say that.

1. GF knows I am not a fan of Berliner weiss.
2. Dont give anyone a Berliner weiss blind. Ever.
3. Seriously. Who does that???
4. OK, do that if you want to laugh and youre an ass.

3921,"2015-09-02",4.1,"A tasty and mild take on this style. Its cloudy witbier yellow w/ a foamy white head. Its nose has a bit of vinous funk to it in the nose w/ a bit of a fresh, husky grain character. This is light bodied but not at all watery w/ vigorous carbonation. Light tartness seems to bring out the fruity character from the nose while an almost lambic-like phenolic complexity lurks quietly in the background. This style and esp. examples that include some sort of fruit tend to be ham-fisted in one way or the other, either they are straight fruit juice or overly sour and harsh. This avoids those pitfalls and that makes for a very nice beer indeed.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

3921,"2014-06-21",4.0,"Syndicate hooked me up with this gem tonight as I was walking out of the Summer Funkfest tasting.... Thanks a bunch Darrel!!

Poured into my Funkfest goblet... pale hazy straw colored brew.. nice white head with good lacing.

Nose is a proper Berliner... floral and lemony... hints of wheat.. smells nicely acidic.

Flavor is fantastic... big clean lactic/lemon wedge acidity combines with a light wheat malt essence.. long and lingering lemon on the finish.

Light body with spritzy high carbonation ... the residual maltiness weighs it down slightly IMHO... but I am nitpicking.

This is amazingly drinkable... I could sup this one all day or at least until my gut broke down or the cavities drove me away.

3921,"2014-06-14",4.0,"As you open the bottle the foam shoots out here, the beer cannot get into your glass quick enough. The aroma is reminiscent of apples and fresh cut lemons. Pours a tantalizing straw color. Thick head retention, as per the foam that gushes out from the opening.

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate sour lemon, light sweaty feet, and faint must. It pours a cloudy dull yellow with a large rocky white head that has great retention. There is a lot of clumpy lacing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with moderate heavy sour citrus and lemon. The finish has some funky/sweaty notes, must, and a touch of metallic notes. Its light bodied with moderate-lively carbonation. Overall, this is very tasty and crushable. I could do without the metallic notes, but its more sour than most Berliners Ive had, so for the most part the metallic flavor gets covered up.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3921,"2014-06-03",4.4,"Nearly clear yellow-gold pour with a huge, pillowy white head that lasts forever and leaves nice sheets of thick lacing. Aroma starts with delicate sour mash tartness, sour floral notes, toasty and floury wheat, lemongrass, a hint of peppery spice, a dry hayfield right after a short rain and some tough to describe fruity notes. Flavor is big on toast, cereal and whole grain wheat flour right away, then comes a flood of delicate, yet fairly intense fruity and acidic floral notes, sort of like rosehips and hibiscus, and some light, untoasted oak notes, toward the finish the acidity grows a bit and the floral and cereal/wheat notes right up to the finish which is mostly clean, but leaves a pleasant floral, tart and mineral aftertaste that remains very inviting. leaving me dying for another sip. Light body, neutral to slightly creamy entry, light, blanketing and sharp carbonation, moderate acidity and crisp, slightly floury finish. A+freaking+mazing. I could drink this stuff all day, at 3%ABV, why not? Surprisingly it remains delicious at any temperature from the fridge right up to room temp, where the flavor opens up and it becomes fairly sweet, though it seems best around 45-50F.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
3921,"2014-06-02",4.6,"One of my very favorite beers, and perfect for the late spring/early summer. Even with the very gentlest a pours, a massive pillowy head pushes out of the glass. If your glass has one of those little laser-etched bubble-generator things (whats the actual name for those?) in the bottom, dont be surprised if the thick, foamy head continues to billow out into a cone of froth towering over the glass. 

The beer itself is golden-straw colored, almost with an extremely faint tinge of emerald green. It smells tart, very lightly grassy. The taste is crisp and clean, slightly tart and a bit sweet, maybe a bit lemony. Mouthfeel is light and lively with carbonation, coupled with acidic sourness. Overall, you could almost liken it to drinking a Mountain Dew in its palate and tartness, but obviously it is quite different in its flavor. Very drinkable, very refreshing, delicious, and sessionable.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","scones"
3921,"2014-05-28",4.4,"The beer is the color of pale straw, translucent, and highly effervescent. Even when poured carefully a massive, yet delicate looking white head fills at least half of my tulip glass. After a couple of minutes the head settles down leaving behind respectable lacing on the walls of the glass, and a few millimeters of pure white foam that floats on the pale yellow liquid. Its an attractive beer. 

The nose is a combination of overripe lemons, mild Belgian yeast funkiness, and cider-like tartness (notes of sour green apples). The taste is lemony, crisp and tart, but not overly sour. The mouthfeel is light and bubbly from the high level of carbonation. The finish is dry, crisp and clean. Not many flavors linger in on your palate, but the carbonation and acidity leave a slight tingling sensation on your tongue.

Dan Carey and New Glarus have put out a gem here. I love the interplay between the lemons and the Belgian yeast notes in the aroma. The taste is fruity, crisp and refreshing. Id describe the smell/taste as being akin to lemon yogurt crossed with apple cider, with the effervescence of champagne. If you want something with mouth puckering sourness, you might find this beer a little tame, but for those testing the waters of sour beers this would be a good entry point. At 3% abv the effects of the alcohol are unnoticeable to me. Without question Ive found a new favorite Berliner Weiss! I just wish I would have brought home more than a four pack. If anyone happens to be passing through Wisconsin in the near future I strongly recommend you give this beer a try.","Ohio, USA","Slats"

Appearance: The body is clear with a golden to amber hue. The head is short and dissipates quickly into a white coating that covers the entire top with a creamy ring.

Taste: Boy this is interesting.

Smells like lemons, white grape skins, some funk, a little metal, some grain and lacto sharpness. Soon as the head dies down a hair Im gonna taste it...Nice lightly crisp ale with some pear, some lemon (sweetened) a grain and rice mix, some light tartness and a bit of almost sweetness on the finish. Looks light, but feels heavier than I had anticipated, nice razor carb and a wet finish. I like this beer, I would drink all day from the can on the lakes.","Spokane, Washington, USA","harrymel"

This may be one of the best New Glarus Unplugged / Thumbprint beers to date. In line with the rest of the sour program it is true to the style without trying to become too Americanized. I have not had enough real berliner weisses to know how it compares to the European examples but I do know this - if I could stock four packs of this in my fridge I would have it at all times.

Aroma / Appearance - A transparent golden base bubbles with life under a heavy white head. Lemon, citrus, and a light sour tang permeate the air with a mild texture not unlike tart lemonade.

Flavor / Palate - Smooth lemons sweep across the tongue and immediately brighten the palate. The yeasty transition carries well into a crisp finish with a mild sour feel that is like a glass of fresh lemonade. The result is very drinkable; you could easily have two or three of these with little palate fatigue at all. Grab some while you still can and do not sit on a fine release.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3921,"2013-09-26",4.3,"3%?!?! Now thats some low boost! 
Pours a nice pale hazy yellow with a fluffy white head that diminishes into a medium sized white head that leaves good lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is subtle and very inviting, its most certainly funkier than most Berliner Weisse Ive tried, its got some barn-yardiness to it. But its got the classic Berliner character too, plenty of yogurt-y lactic character, plenty of bready yeastiness, some bright fruit. The white grape component I think is attributing to a nice harmony in the aroma as its got a bit of a white wine character to it, not exactly as musty or pungent as Champagne, but getting there. 

The flavor is just really enjoyable, tart with some really bright lemony characteristics. Its got a nice white grape character to it, with some plain yogurt-y sourness. Its just got a touch of the woodiness from the barrel.  Lively under-ripe strawberry & fermented cider notes with some yeastiness, some raw wheat, and just a slight twang of bitterness. 

The palate is lively, prickly, sharp and not really thin in any way. 

This one knocks the whole high flavor low alcohol thing right out of the park.

Mouthfeel is light bodied but not watery with medium high carbonation. Low acidic astringency and almost no alcohol warmth. 
Overall a very nice, very drinkable Berliner. I think I prefer them to be a bit tarter with a touch of Brett character to add complexity. I like that the tartness does not drown out the wheat and malt character or the faint fruit esters.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3921,"2013-08-14",3.8,"Bottle. Didnt catch this one the first time around when it was ""unplugged"". Boy is the Berliner Weiss style really hot right now! Everywhere you turn somebody else is putting one out. A little difficult to describe the aroma; it conjures up memories of beer ratings of long ago, but when it really gets down to it, it has a slight sour aspect to it. Hazy gold body with cascading carbonation, just like champagne...the champagne of the North. Huge lasting messy white head. My wife was going to take a sip when I first poured it but she wasnt going to get any beer so I suggested she wait. 10 minutes later and theres still almost an inch of head. Tart initial mouthfeel, but unlike any Berliner Ive previously had, this one is actually thirst quenching and not so sour as to be difficult to drink. I really have to hand it to Dan on this one. Cant be the easiest style to make, if for no other reason that its so different from all other styles, but also because it has 3 different yeast strains that you have to get right. But he nailed it. No syrup necessary, although as was suggested by the owner of the Joseph Wolf brewery for their Berliner, UV Grape could make for an outstanding accompaniment.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"

3921,"2013-08-10",3.7,"Tasting of bottles of the New Glarus Thumbprint Series Berliner Weiss (2012) versus the New Glarus Unplugged Berliner Weiss (2009).  First as you can tell by the pic that the Unplugged is quite darker near light amber hue versus the straw hue of the Thumbprint which also has a longer lasting head in the Berliner bowl it is being served in.  The aroma on the Unplugged is stronger acidity and more malty whilest the newer version is slightly flowery, grainy and a tad barnyard.  Taste both are much more similar with the Unplugged again a touch sweeter with a very light earthiness and the Thumbprint a touch more wheaty and funky. Sourness is almost the same but the Thumbprint despite a thinner mouth feel actually has a longer acidic finish. Of course the 2009 does have a bit of oxidation but nothing alarming... I actually like the depth of palate on the older sibling more. I gave the Unplugged a 3.8 rating back when it was fresh in 2009, I will stick with that. I will give the new kid on the block a 3.7 rating today. I will happily finish both.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Aromas offer gentle white grape, lemony and lactic sour elements, a bit of yogurt. Some wheat, gentle bread, and dry grainy and straw feel. Nice, a bit mellow. Initial is a lighter beer in body, quite crushable. Some nice effervescent carbonation meets a firm sourness. Lemony and lactic meets white grape, tart grape, and some straw. A bit of yogurt, medium sour middle with a touch of straw, dry bready malt. Backend lingers out with more grape, some yogurt, and a bit of dryness. Light, easily crushable in the heat.

The flavor holds some duller lemon zest, tart grape skin, and a big hit of oak and crisp wheat on the finish that creates a really nice flavor in tandem. Lingering kicks of grape are perceived in the far, far finish which only increases the enjoyability. Moutfheel is light and carbonation is lively.

3921,"2013-06-03",4.0,"2013 (Thumbprint) batch. 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Huge thanks to Yamar68 for this one!

A - Pours a hazy light yellow/amber body. Three fingers of fluffy white foam initially that simmers down into a super thin capping and some patchy edging. Moderate lacing and a swirl creates a new layer of foam.

S - Fruity with notes of lemon, pear and green grapes. Some lactic acid followed by a lot of crackery malts. It almost finishes like a fruited adjunct lager in terms of how the tart fruitiness goes up against a cereal graininess. Not overly exciting but very standard for the style.

T - Tart lemons and pear with a huge wave of wheat and crackers. This is almost lemon-meringue like. Some lactic acid and a dry wine-like finish. Extremely refreshing and satisfying. Mouth feel is crisp yet full and creamy.

3921,"2013-05-19",4.3,"With the 20th Anniversary of New Glarus Brewery taking place in 2013, they have been bringing back some of the past favorites as part of their celebration. First came Edel Pils and now its time for some Berliner Weiss. Berliner Weiss last debuted about 4 years ago and I never got a chance to try it as I was just entering the craft beer world so Im very excited to try this one.

It pours a pale yellow color with a frothy white head. The aroma is a combination of wheat, yeast, and tart fruits. It certainly has a Belgian style feel going for it. Overall its very inviting with hints of banana as well.

It take a little while to get used to the tartness of the beer although its no where near as tart as a sour/wild ale. The texture is smooth and creamy with a balanced mixture of wheat and yeast.  This is definitely something different from New Glarus other offerings. I cant say Ive had anything else quite like it. 

A unique tasty brew from New Glarus is always a hit! Im glad to see them bring back older brews so I have something to try I havent had before. Im always a fan of them bringing beer back they said didnt sell well before so a new group a beer lovers can try it for themselves. I hear that next up on their list is a new 20th Anniversary Strong Ale due out in late May 2013.  Im getting thirsty thinking about it already.

3921,"2013-05-14",2.5,"May 2013 bottle labeled as Thumbprint Series served in a straight sided Odonata glass.  Pours a bright yellow with a sticky white head. Decent lacing.  Unexpectedly sweet wheat malt aroma at first with a little funkiness upon further assessment.  Very light and effervescent in the mouth but also very light in the flavor department, even for the style.  Light, lemon citrus tartness with relatively big wheat flavor mid palate through the finish. Very clean.","Whalezbro, Illinois, USA","HighWine"
3921,"2013-05-11",4.1,"Hazy yellow with white foam. Sort of a tasty wheat aroma. Taste is sour up front but finishes with yeast wheat flavor. Great beer. Easy to drink and grows on you. I could drink a few.","Illinois, USA","Doghair"
3921,"2013-05-07",3.8,"Bottle.  Thank you to Dan Carey for bringing this back!  Straw gold with tons of rocky, frothy head.  Lightly tart nose with lemon citrus, some white grape, a bit of spice, oak, and faint vanilla.  Actually light notes similar to the tail end of Cranbic.  Flavor is moderately tart lemon, light berry, and white grape with more of the spice and light oak.  Finishes clean with mild wet wheat malt andlemon.  Very light and refeshing.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
