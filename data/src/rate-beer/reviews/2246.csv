2246,"2017-02-17",3.4,"Huge thanks to tom10101 for getting me this and also vtafro and JTClockwork for getting this eventually to me. Had with Thai food. Fine pour of light brownish orange. Nose is faint maple and lambic funk. Tastes funky of basement, maple, honey, soap and lemon. Not bad aftertaste. Not too sweet.","New York, USA","Jow"

2246,"2016-08-31",3.7,"Not bad overall. The maple is quite subtle and not overdone. Im able to pick up the usual sour Lambic characteristics. A bit pricy though.","Ontario, CANADA","HopsandBolts"
2246,"2016-07-16",3.0,"Bottle 500ml.
Pours golden with no serious head. Aroma is of maple, minerals. Taste is of acidity, maple, minerals, metal, oxydation products, sourness. Palate: Medium-full bodied, soft carbonation. Overall: No funk. Way better than expected.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","Minderbinder"
2246,"2016-06-25",3.3,"Pours a clear golden with no head and no lacing. Nose is of maple and light lambic-esque funk. Taste is moderately tart with some maple and very lightly sweet. Deducting points here since a faro is supposed to be sweet to some extent. Moderate body and carbonation. A pretty nice ""lambic"" base actually and Im glad the maple isnt fake extract like in their Rousse Êrable. It should have retained at least some sweetness, though.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
2246,"2016-06-21",3.2,"pours hazy medium dark golden with a small off-white cap offering minimal retention and lacing. woody oak barrels, clean toasted wheat, acetone traces unfortunately, hint of sweetness - maple syrup solids, old grassy hops, minerals. moderately low carbonation, light body - watery; semi-sweet maple-herbal finish. now, this is an uncommon faro and it somehow works with maple syrup sugars added.. in an awkward fashion.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
2246,"2016-06-21",3.1,"Bottle (500 ml) shared at tasting. Slightly hazy bright golden-orange with a small small ring of white foam. Aroma isnt as bad as expected with maple notes, hints of citrus, caramel, mild acetone, soapy notes and mild vegetal presence but its really not that bad. Taste is not too sweet - especially for a Faro - wtih mild funk, soapy notes, vegetal notes and caramel. Medium body. Moderate to medium carbonation. The finish - never thought I would say that of a Schoune beer - is really fun with a nice maple kick (never cloying). It has some Faro character and funk and its really not that bad for what it is.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2246,"2016-06-21",3.2,"Robe ambrée claire sans col de mousse Arômes deau citronné, sucre dérable, un peu de jus de pomme. En bouche, léger lambic, sucre, pomme, citron. Finale très orienté vers le sucre dérable. Je ne suis pas un expert du faro, très loin de là, mais cest bien.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","Franckg"
2246,"2016-06-21",3.2,"Bottle shared. Clear gold pour with no head. Aroma is woody, light maple, light solventy notes, soapy. Taste is sweet and sour, nice maple flavor, light acetone. Palate is light, slightly watery an dry. Hate to say it but this is not half bad. Far from the worst Faro Ive had, although its a bit dry.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2246,"2016-06-16",3.3,"Bottle: Poured a clear light amber color beer with a medium size foamy head with OK retention. Aroma of maple notes with light tart notes is OK. Taste is also a mix between some maple notes with residuals sugar notes and light rat and funky notes. Body is about average with OK carbonation. Interesting idea but not sure the results is a success.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
