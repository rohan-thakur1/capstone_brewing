Fridge cold (7-8 C). Aroma is alcohol, rice and citrus fruity. Flavour is rice, a bit alcohol, watermelon and some citric hints. The alcohol noteable is quite ""sharpedged"". Dry palate. <!-- br -->
Room Temperature (17-18C). Aroma gets a bit ""fuller"" of the same as colder. The main difference is the alcohol which now fits in better both in aroma and flavour. Dry palate. <!-- br -->
Warmed up to about 30C. Smooth as whole impression, the alcohol in not as sharpedged anymore, and it somehow feels even more full than the lower temperatures. A bit warm vodkaish, but the fruityness (citrus and watermelon) was a big positive thing compared to Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Traditional Light Sake.

My first try with sake. As it can be served in the different temperatures, I wanted to try this both cold and warm.
Chilled, around 10-15c
Clear appearance, like water. Alcoholic fruity nose: mash, grappa, licorice, grapefruit. Taste is also like drinking watered grappa. Slightly fruity, rice flours flavor. Dry mouthfeel, alcoholic warming comes afterwards. 
Warmed, to hand-warm temperature
Aroma turns much softer and mild, like inhaling healthy menthol fumes. Warmed this is much easier to drink - soft palate with rice and alcoholic warming. Rating is quite hard as this has very little   to do flavors and other characters of beer. Appearance was propably ""perfect"" for daiginjo-shu so it will get average 3 (for beer it would be 1).","Pori, FINLAND","TBone"

Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic. Light body, watery texture, flat carbonation, moderately alcoholic. I've had [cheap] sake a few times in the past, but this is my first serious attempt to review one. Figured I'd start with something reasonably serious but not terribly pricey. Seems to have slight elements of white wine, mead, and beer alike...I've had examples of each that were similar to this.  This is not an exceedingly interesting or complex example, or so it seems, but it's quite pleasant and better than any sake I'd previously had.  Giving an appearance score may be difficult with sakes, I expect, as a great deal are pretty much colorless...in what case would you give a 1 or 2, if it had dead insects floating in it?","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1569,"2004-02-09",3.8,"The problem with Sam's Wine's sake selection is the ones that say Daiginjo on the label are actually sub-par Daiginjos.  In the end, they leave their taster with the perception that he's had the best of Japanese sake and what was all the fuss about.  Horin is an example of this.  So is Kamoizumi Daiginjo (to be avoided).  Horin is good - quite good - but it's at the bottom end of the Daiginjo spectrum for the following reasons.  First, Horin has a hint of yellowness, which shouldn't be there in ANY Daiginjo.  Second, Horin's from Gekkeikan, best known for crap sake, but we're going to rate it as if we don't know that fact.  Third, the flavor: The alcohol nose doesn't materialize in the flavor like you'd think it would.  But, there's little else in this one-dimensional, not-fruity, not-candyish Daiginjo to grab you.  It's light, creamy and fairly delicate, but there IS alcohol there and it grabs you before it's down the esophagus.  Never forget: you almost always get what you pay for, (unless you're drinking Ohtouka).  In fairness, this Horin is better than 90% of sake out there, just don't expect it to compete with most other Daiginjos, and several Ginjos will beat the pants off of it.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
