The flavor is spicy, with a medium to low level of hoppiness & really pretty honey and apple forward. The bitterness level keeps things balanced pretty well here, nothing is terribly out of place.

A bit too much carbonation at the end for my liking (considering the middle felt so smooth). There are hints of hops bitterness, but nothing that even compares to a pale ale.

1845,"2015-03-16",3.1,"Pours a caramel color. Aroma is very sweet- caramel and toffee. Taste contains more bitter or dry elements than I would expect based on the coloration and taste, and I think thats a good thing. Hops upfront quickly melt into a Werthers original candy type taste that is sweet, but not overly sweet. I guess Im a little picky in some respects for a guy wholl drink adjunct lagers when finances dictate- I enjoy some malty beers, but when they taste a little too much like candy, that can be a turn-off, and when they get a little too roasted and burnt, that can be a turn-off. This definitely is not the latter. It has some aspects of the former, but skirts the line nicely with the upfront hoppiness and not overdoing it on the backend sweetness despite the base backend flavor being similar to beers that cross the line. I would say a good beer, but not spectacular.  Nicely avoids some common pitfalls, but its aim isnt to the side of the bock equation Id aim for.  I think I would raise my rating a lot if it were only relative to beers that smell and somewhat taste like candy.

1845,"2014-11-14",3.4,"Classic Rogue beer, apparently a true, i.e. bottom-fermented, German light bock initially but top-fermented nowadays, like many Dutch spring bocks. Off-white, thinly structured head breaking open quickly but leaving a steady rim and some lacing, colour a warm and deep orange blonde, clear with slow fizz, cloudy with deposit. Fruity aroma of orange peel, passion fruit, cake, honey, dough, cookies, mango, single malt, something very earthy especially after adding the deposit, hints of cigarette tobacco, chicken soup, hazelnuts, fried eggs, cooked pear and a kind of faint rotting smell I cant quite put my finger on - and which fascinates me rather than putting me off. Vivid fruity onset, mango, red apple, hint of orange, rounded and slick, somewhat flat and undercarbonated mouthfeel (which explains the limited head retention), nutty, caramelly, soft bready backbone, finishing in nutty maltiness covered by a resinous, somewhat oily, citrussy and herbal hop bitterness, long and dry and being accompanied by some slightly warming, gin-like alcohol. Id say this is a typical American take on the style; other top-fermented helles bockbiers I tasted were a lot sweeter and less hoppy.

OCZY : piwo ma kolor bursztynowy z odcieniami pomarańczy. Piana jest mała o kolorze kości słoniowej. Niezły lacing. 

NOS : aromat tarty i owoców takich jak banan, morela, słodkich muskatowych winogron i rodzynek. Do tego można dodać delikatne aromaty surowego ciasta, sernika i alkoholu. 

USTA : piwo jest średnio gazowane. Gęste o konsystencji tłustego mleka. 
Słodkie o nutach słodowych słodkiego biszkopta i bezy. Nuty owocowe są bardzo intensywne i nadają kwaskowatość. Ta również przypomina śmietanę. Gorzkość jest bardzo delikatna ale uporała się z przełamaniem dominujących słodów i drożdży. Wspomaga ja w niewielkim stopniu alkohol. Posmak przypomina mi uczucie jakie miałem po zjedzeniu tarty z białymi winogronami. Delikatnie cierpki jak goździki i pestki winogron. 

ODCZUCIA : mocno słodowe piwo ale dobrze skomponowane. Przyjemne w ustach. Intensywne i bardziej ma charakter piwa degustacyjnego. Można go parować do cielęciny i wieprzowiny, do sosów grzybowych i beszamel.

1845,"2014-04-08",3.6,"355ml Bottle from Good Spirits Co, Glasgow (£3.50):
Hoppy at first with some caramel and toffee notes coming through along with some burst of citrus and faint pine. There is a malt base that is a semi-sweet one and I could detect bread and sweet fruits and yeast too.

Copper amber colour with a half-centimetre tall, foamy head that is a very slightly off-white colour and settles as a thick lacing on the top that covers the entire surface.

Pine hops and some citrus kick things off along with some caramel malts and a floral taste that is a little hoppy and hints at some bitterness. There is some sweetness and bread with a few fruits as well, notably some apple.

Medium bodied, a fairly good balance and medium carbonation as well, this beer is smooth with a dry and bitter tang from the citrus and some sweetness throughout along with a crisp finish.

An interesting one, almost seems like an American pale ale & definitely an unusual take on the Maibock style with the beer growing on you as you work your way down the glass. A good beer but I imagine this will be a one off for me and I wont be trying to pick it up again.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

Rich golden amber with just a faint haze and a pillowy cream coloured head. The aroma is toffeeish and sweet with emphasis on lighter caramels. Its a short description, but doesnt do the sheer loveliness justice. Just the one powerful snort of the aroma isnt enough. I gave my mother-in-law a sniff of this beer (and she is noted for not being a beer drinker) and she was impressed at the caramel and toffee aromas. A taste confirmed that she wasnt a beer drinker, but also that the aroma is the most enticing part for me also. It is a bit sweet with toffee (again) and caramalt. I suppose it is well within style in this area and there is no doubt it is well made. I found this grew on me, the longer it was in my mouth, as the actress said to the bishop.

Some faint notes of white grapes, lemon, and some spice notes (coriander or clove maybe) can be drawn out there too. It pours a clear, syrupy orange liquid with a light, thin head that doesnt leave much lacing. Its a medium/medium-high syrupy sweet with a light, clean, balanced bitter & sourness filling in a secondary role as well as a bit of saltiness. The medium-full bodied beer is slick with an average amount of carbonation that keeps it texture on the thinner side. The asiago (maybe parmesan) cheese flavor is fairly prominent on the tongue too and is accompanied by honey notes and a bit of apricot-fruit flavors. Its very crisp with a resin feel in the mouth and finishes with white grapes and apricot. Grapefruit and pine hop flavors leave a light aftertaste.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Cloudy hazy amber red colour; with dusty yeast sediments; One finger head and off-white foam which lasts for 1 minute; Very good sticky lacing and notable small carbonation; Pretty fragrant aroma of grapefruit, pineapple, honey, molasses, ale malt, light orange, and light caramel; Pleasant light sweet taste of ale malt, with fairly light grapefruit, shades of red fruits, molasses, very light liquorices, light spices, light citrus and slight grass; Medium body, slick palate; Taste profile is lightly sweet and pretty refreshingly hoppy ale base. Grapefruit is not expressive but fairly refreshing, plus the low dose spice makes the ale base pretty enjoyable and somewhat seductive. Yum! Hoppiness is typically Bock-like - very low citrus and grass in nose but quite refreshing in taste, the Perle and Saaz is at work here. Very little bitterness but detectable astringency for a slightly comfy finish; Slightly dry after taste; Very easy to mouth.

Comments: This is quite a well-made brew in every aspect - aroma, ale base, grapefruit nose and taste, spicy hops, and so on - is expressed in low key yet quite refreshing and layback kind of way.

Smell: This is my first of this style. It smells interesting. No doubt a load of malts, but almost a caramel smell as well. The alcohol is also very present.

Taste/feel: Much like the smell, to be honest. Theres also a slight ""funk"" in there thats actually not too unnerving. I also pick up some dark fruits in the back somewhere (prunes?), as well as a tad of tartness. A pretty sweet beer on the start, but a bit of bitterness and spice at the end. Rather balanced, and nothing overwhelming. The feel is creamy and perfect with the amount of carbonation, which is low. Alcohol is also present.

It looks great, it feels great, and it has a very solid taste thats fairly mild, yet keeps you drinking.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

1845,"2012-12-27",3.1,"Reviewed 10/22/2012. 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.

A: Pours a dark copper color thats clear, but not perfectly so. Theres about one fingers worth of barely offwhite head which retains itself sufficiently. A nice film of lacing is left on the side of the glass, as well.

S: Theres quite a bit of caramel on the nose, and - dare I say - its faintly chocolaty as well. The noble hops give a nice grassiness to it, and makes it different from the dime-a-dozen IPA with crystal malts and Cascade hops. I dont know why Im comparing it to the average IPA, I should be thinking of it as a maibock with ale yeast...

T: Tastes exactly like I expected it to - which is a maibock with ale yeast. It has that sort of pumpernickel bread flavor to it I expect from the average bock, only a bit lighter. The finish is pleasantly hoppy, but the problem is, the initial flavors and the finish dont really do much to differentiate itself, so its kind of one note. I can see why this has a following, though.

M: Rogue did a decent job of keeping this crisp without the lager yeast, but the body itself is too heavy for the flavors they present and the carbonation doesnt make it seem any lighter. Despite that, this is easy to drink.

O: This beer represents a conundrum for me. Its the kind of middle of the road daily drinker I envisioned it would be - but its priced just out of said middle of the road daily drinker range at $12/6 pk. For that reason, I wouldnt pick this up over offerings from Sierra Nevada, New Belgium, or the like.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

A pint, served in a Sierra Nevada Celebration glass. The bar is dark and difficult to see in, but the beer looked a copper-amber colour, slight haze to it and a white head on top.

The nose was more malt than hop, with a caramel sweetness tempered with a spiced sourness.

The thoughts of sour caramel carried on into the taste and I couldnt get the thoughts out of my head. A faint hop bitterness came through, but otherwise I couldnt get past my thoughts.

Interesting, but Id never have considered it a Maibock if it had been a blind tasting. Too weak in the mouthfeel for me.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

1845,"2012-03-30",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2014 Rogue Dead Guy Ale is bronze in color and has a nutty aroma thats immediately apparent once opened.  The initial taste is rich and complex: first you taste a bit of malt followed by bitter hops and a hint of fruit.  The taste lingers for about a good half-minute.  My only major complaint is the longer term after-effect is rather dry, and this dryness becomes more pronounced after a second beer.  Its also expensive here in southwestern Missouri - six-packs go for almost $13 at my local stores.  2014 REVISIT: Found a bomber that was cheaper, so wanted to see what I thought of this with a more experienced palate.  There is some nuttiness, but also a strong lager type of aroma.  The hops are not that bitter, but I stand by the malt and fruit descriptions from my original rating.  Dryness is spot-on.  This is a pretty flavorful brew, and it fits the heller bock descriptions Ive read rather well: dry, some hops, yet mostly malty.","Missouri, USA","kdm1984"

1845,"2011-10-11",3.3,"Pours a rich amber color with a huge, foamy, eggshell-white head that settles to a persistent thin film. The aroma is a complex but somewhat dull combination of light citrusy hops, earthy yeast, and a lager-like clean caramel sweetness. The flavor is much more hop-forward, with an assertive yet rounded combination of citrus and pine. A semi-dry, biscuity sweet malt provides some balance, along with a musty yeasty character. The texture is mouth-filling, but there is only a moderate lingering resinous feel, and the finish is actually a bit drying.

1845,"2011-09-13",3.7,"I poured a 22oz bomber into a large beer mug.Appearance: Dark amber color with an orange glaze. Slight cloudy body, but plenty of carbonation visible. Forms a large, beige, soapy head which laces and retains quite well.Smell: Light confectionary sweetness - mild toffee and caramel notes, otherwise mild and neutral.Taste: Theres a lot of debate whether Dead Guy Ale is indeed an ale (because its brewed with ale yeast), or a lager (because its brewed in the Maibock style). The first thing I notice about it is how much it tastes and feels like an ale. Its too thick, soft, and tepid to be a lager - but then again that describes many doppelbocks and other beers of the bock family. This is not a complex beer - its quite simple and to-the-point. Up front is a mild malty sweetness of toffee and caramel. The middle imparts noticeable bitterness along with some lager-like grainy texture and taste. Theres sweet caramel or butterscotch flavor in the immediate aftertaste, but it fades quickly and a slightly dry sensation emerges. Its tasty palate to be sure, but nothing mind-blowing. Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a soft, comfortable texture. No fizziness.Drinkability: Although the name may be strange, I find Rogue Dead Guy Ale to be a great introductory craft beer for most people. The palate is rather mild with hints of lager quality, but has a genuine taste thats sweet but not obnoxious. Its smoothness makes it easy to slug down and the weight of 6.5% ABV seems higher than it feels. Ive seen people session this and I can understand why.Overall, Rogue Dead Guy Ale is an interesting beer for many reasons, but I dont think its quite the elite beer its reputation would have me believe it is.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

As a German Maibock, a strech for an American recreation, but with its own spin it tuned out excellent.  Dark, gold-red-amber color, nice bubbly head, from great yeast. Lacing and legs are top notch.  Aroma is nice, I would have expected more, but due to recreating a German style it is close to true. Taste is dry, dry honey-dark fruit and caramel malt, the yeast is what u truly get the style and flavor from.  I remeber this being hoppier, last time, but that was 2003 or so and I have drank a million IPAs and IIPAs since then, so maybe Im used to the malty and hoppiness of all beers now. All around great beer, if u havent had one, I strongly recommend this one.

bianca, buona presenza, persistenza media, non molto compatta
COLORE:
arancio scuro, tendente al marrone, leggera velatura ma senza residui
INTENSITA / FINEZZA:
abbastanza intensa con spettro ampio, giocando sul contrasto malto-luppulo
AROMI:
malto, caramello, erba 
GUSTO:
dolce di malto tostato e caramello, miele
RETROGUSTO:
un finale amaro di luppolo, piuttosto erbaceo ma molto equilibrato, non pungente che si fonde molto bene con il dolce dei malti che torna senza scomparire
CORPO:
corpo medio, morbida in bocca, carbonatazione medio-bassa
Ottima birra, nota di merito allequilibrio fra dolce e amaro che si alternano dando un buon dinamismo in bocca senza stancare. Rispetto ad una classica maibock tedesca, il malto non domina prepotentemente, 6.5 % alcol quasi inavvertibili; daltra parte si sentono i luppuli classici degli stili americani, con un amaro erbaceo pronunciato, però in questo caso non pungente e molto ben dosato.

Its hazy with some lighter orange highlights.  In the smell, I detected some well rounded caramel sweetness.  Hints of peach and a fragrance similar to a candy apple.  Some breadiness is there, but it seems to be pushed to the side to let the sweetness come through.  The taste revealed some caramel and some dry wheat bread.  Some candy sweetness with the ripe apple.  Very well balanced.  Some prominent bitterness tickles the tongue.  Only a small, welcome alcohol warmth and flavor.  Medium mouthfeel.  Smooth, crisp, dry and slightly refreshing.  Covers the palate very well.  Leaves plenty of flavor behind.  This, once again, is a solid, well rounded effort from Rogue.  They are quickly becoming one of my favorite brewers.  This brew is easily drinkable.  Would work well at any point during the year.  It is considerably sweet, so that may deter some, but it would still be enjoyable for me through several rounds.  Worth a try if you havent tried it yet.","Kentucky, USA","Shrews629"

Smell: The aroma is full of bready sweetness, bready yeast and mellow hops. 

Taste/Palate: The flavor has good toasted and bready maltiness with some mild caramel, toffee and light nutty notes. This is backed up with nice herbal/floral hop balance. It finishes well balanced and extremely drinkable. The palate has a smooth full feel with soft carbonation.

1845,"2010-08-22",3.7,"Rating from notes taken in early August, when I was having trouble connecting with the site ... How little can one rating matter? This has to be among the most-rated beers in the world. To add my own two cents, this features the abundant sweet pale malts that you associate with a classic maibock, but finishes you off with some hop bitterness in the American craft beer style. Those hops would seem to clash with all that sweetness, but somehow the yeast pulls it all together. The finish proves bitter in the same way that a baguette is bitter. This is unlike the run-of-the-mill ipas that cloud our judgment and palates, making that hop finish worthy both of the malts that preceded it and of the beers status as a landmark of American craft brewing.","Athens, Georgia, USA","bjt512"

The taste is malty and slightly sweet with some caramel to it, there is also a nice bitterness that it finishes with. Medium bodied with nice carbonation and fairly smooth. Overall very nice, close to the double dead guy and easily one of my favourites. Edit: Had this on tap for the first time recently, it is far superior on tap.","Regina, Saskatchewan, CANADA","Sask89"
1845,"2010-04-22",3.4,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2010 12oz Bottle. Aroma lacks a bit of punch, though is very pleasant. A mellow cloud of vanilla, yeast, bread/dough, malt, fruitiness and some citrus/spice from the hops. Flavour is nicely balanced; comes on first with slightly toasty malts, almost Pilsner malt in style, but much breadier and very doughy, a little bit more vanilla, good bitterness creeping in bringing with it more citrus, orange-peel and spiciness. Body is quite gassy, and I wonder if this is due to it being in a smaller bottle, as I generally find that the 24oz bots are alot less fizzy. Still it keeps the beer light-mid bodied which gives the beer a very refreshing and quaffable quality. Abv is well disguised. Finish is nicely bitter with a touch of nuttiness and a bit of sweet bitterness reminiscent of Danish pastry. For Rogues sort of flagship beer I think its really good, perhaps not my favourite from what Ive tasted, but its faithfull to the core style, but still injects a good dose of US brewing which makes the beer pleasantly unique.","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"

1845,"2009-12-21",4.5,"Aroma is malty with a slight hint of what smells almost like chocolate - interesting and complex.  The appearance was cloudy with a honey-like color, small head that seemed to dissipate quickly.  The taste bitter sweet - one can surely taste the sweet malts and the bitter hops both separately and in tandem.  The palate was amazing.  Seemingly, this beer has four different and distinct tastes depending on where this beer resided.  Hoppy, malty, bitter, full, soft carbonation - very refreshing to have such a complex palate.  Sweet on the tip to hoppy in the back of my mouth.  Overall, this beer would be a full twenty out of twenty, but the aroma could use some help.  Maybe with a slightly more lively carbonation it would help with carrying the aroma.  So many hops probably doesnt help with head retention with the hop oils present and carbonation might help with that as well.  But, just my opinion.","USA","jhudson1977"

Quenching.  I am not certain that if I was a monk and this was a meal-replacement ale, I would be totally satiated.  The alcohol is not noticeable on the palate, but shows itself after a few sips.

T: Very tasty, and a smooth-drinking beer. Comes off mostly sweet from the malt and the fruit, but finishes with a mild bitterness that leaves a light dryness in the mouth. Doesnt taste like 6.5%... dangerous.

M: Medium-bodied and creamy, with average carbonation.

A good mix of hops, malts, sweet, and bitterness all come together quite nicely here. Tastes like asweet ale with some caramel hints

Goes down relatively smooth and well-rounded with a light-medium body and mild carbonation.

Id say that this is my first tasting of a Helles bock and I liked this version of the style, but I dont have alot to compare it to. The ABV is a bit high for me to make it a personal session beer.

Taste is spot on my definition of ALE! Barley and hops are in perfect unison here. Not too much of either, and not too little. Sweet roasted, nutty barley and floral citrusy hops.

The aroma was of toasted caramel malts, citrus hops and a biscuit yeast with strong citrus, toffee and caramel notes.

The taste was sweetly bitter with a hint of caramel in the beginning then progressed into much bitterer flavor with a nice dose of citrus at the end, I am guessing a little lemon and grapefruit. The flavor stuck around long enough to let one enjoy the nice citrusy hoppy aftertaste.

1845,"2009-04-20",3.5,"12 oz bottle (have had this one many time on tap while out and about with friends, so i have had a rating based on the draft version, just havent taken the time to write down my notes on it).  A well balanced aroma, fairly unique, not too potent.  Some spicy citrus zest, nutty cookie, popcorn, a little funky herb, leafy grass, and German pale malt.  Pour is decent, not a bad looking beer with the sleek dark burnt orange color, smaller frothy carbonation head, medium light opacity.  The feel on the beer isnt bad either as theres a good crispness that combines with a creamier fuller feel.  The taste is kind of muddled yet in general balanced as flavors come in and out, with no one player really solidifying its presence. Caramel cookie, citrus, leafy salad hops, and pale malts probably stand out the most.  As one of the beers that was there while I was first getting into beer, Dead Guy will always be remembered.

AROMA: Bread, pine, citrus 

FLAVOR: Nothing really terrible here. Sweet honey-like grain flavors hit me up front, then a grapefruit-like bitterness in the aftertaste. The two did not blend too well for me. It was like two very separate parts with no harmony, the bitterness just did not finish as well as I would have liked.

PALATE: Rather light mouthfeel. A little thinner than I prefer. Carbonation is good.

OVERALL IMPRESSION: Overall, this is an o.k.  ale. The lighter body allows one to drink easily, but the after taste was just a little harsh. Others have given this a high rating. Maybe a different bottle will change my opinion.

Crisp and dry on the palate with a nice bitter hop aftertaste that didnt linger longer than necessary. Malt undertones are welcome presence. No trace of grassyness like you get with an overhopped ale or IPA. This is one very well balanced ale. One of the best i’ve had in a long time.

Oh, and just to keep my doctor off my back, let’s put a mixed green salad on the side.","Washington, USA","HoppyGuy"

1845,"2008-08-18",3.4,"On draft, Dead Guy came to me with a thin layer of foam covering the top of my liquid bliss. At least a fingers worth of head, I am greeted by a dry, hoppy nose with hints of lemon and orange. The hops are present up front in the swallow, fading nicely into malt smoothness with a hint of sweet caramel and nuts. Orange amber in color, the light coming through my glass makes it almost shine. Not as creamy buttery as Old Thumper for example, Dead Guy still exerts a nice malt presence as hops add their citrus zing to the palate. As Dead Guy warms and I near the end of my glass, I am left with the impression of lemon hops and an almost spicy peppery finish supported by a malt lightly sweet backbone.

Not overly carbonated, Dead Guy is a solid west-coast interpretation of a Heller Bock, and one of Rogue’s flagship beers. Ive had Dead Guy both on draft and bottle, and enjoyed it every time.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

1845,"2008-08-05",3.3,"Bottle.  Aroma is of fruit (apricot?) and malt.  Flavor is initially surprisingly sweet, a swirl of caramel malt and orange marmalade, and pine.  It stays fairly sweet throughout, though the finish reveals a hint of bittering hops that I assume were present from the start but overshadowed.  This beer is very tasty, thats for sure.  However, my quite fond memories of this beer when I first started drinking craft brew have proved off-base.  I think I might have placed merit on this beer more on the name and not the quality:  tasty as it is, I feel the malt is just a little too forward and sticky; the flavor also fades a bit too quickly.

That one took me a while to nail, but its definitely that all-too familiar hotel hot tub smell. The flavor is milder than I expected - this would work really well as an eisbock (frozen/concentrated), but as is, it seems diluted. Luckily the chlorine didnt translate to the flavor - caramel malts and citrus rind, with floral / herbal hops on the back end. Palate is disappointing - I want this to be thicker.

1845,"2008-05-23",4.1,"This is that perfect beer Ive been looking for. Lets be honest, even beer gurus need a brew on occasion that is NOT insanely hop driven, over-the-top ABV, nor sweetened like dessert. We just need a good solid option. Enter stage left, Dead Guy Ale. This may be the most well-balanced beer Ive had. It opens and closes with bread, and never are the hops overpowering, nor is it potbellied in malt. It is remarkably clean, but still complex. Not overly carbonated. Excellent with food. It is what macros pretend to be: clean, well-adjusted. The difference being this brew accomplishes with flying colors.","New Hampshire, USA","tylerss20"

It has a very balanced taste: Clean wheat with a delightfully mild bitterness which seems to complement the flavor nicely. The mouthfeel is very smooth all the way through.

Fruity, floral aroma, with some cheese.  I have never tried a heller bock before, but this seems like a bock with extra hops.  I taste sweet malt, oranges, bruised fruit, and figs.

Dark amber pour with a little head that as if on queue wisped away before the glass overflowed.  Aroma was spicy with oranges, melons, and hops.  The flavor was extremely well balanced.  I was actually amazed by the balance and how the flavors rolled seamlessly and effortlessly.  Similar to the aroma, the flavor was much heavier and filling.

Pours a burnt orange color almost looks like a dark rich honey. There is a white medium sized head that forms and soon dissipates to a white film, zero lacing is left on my glass and a steady stream of carbonation works its way up to the top. The aroma is nice easily detected but not too strong which primarily consists of delectable sweet malts. Very pleasant and appealing the scent lured me into a balanced flavor of sweet malts. I was expecting something over the top but this beer was simple and delivered, perhaps perfecting a recipe that relies on a sturdy malt characteristic only is what makes this ale so good. Creamy mouthfeel that goes down full and finishes slightly dry. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer simply for what it does right.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"
1845,"2007-05-17",4.4,"Bottle and on tap.  Slightly occluded copper amber pour, with minimal head.  Wonderful medium roasted malt flavors, with more dimensions emerging as the aftertaste lingers.  Medium bodied, and very well balanced for a beer with so much character.
I have had this beer by itself many times, but also at a tasting where we paired it next to an authentic German maibock.  It was a fascinating tasting as we got to really taste and tell the difference made by the use of the ale yeast instead of the lager yeast.  While the flavor profiles of each beer were similar, the Dead Guy had much more depth and layers of flavor.  It was almost like looking at something in 3 dimensions, when you had seen before only a 2 dimensional picture of it.
One final note on the Dead Guy.  As a bartender at a bar with a great deal of draft beer selections, Dead Guy is one of my favorite beers, not only because of my enjoyment of it, but also because it is one of my most useful selling tools.  Because it stands on the bridge between ales and lagers, I have found it to be more effective than any other brew we carry at getting lager lovers to step over that bridge and try some of the wonders the ale world has to offer.","Winter Springs, Florida, USA","jdhunt76"

Dead Guy poured a hazy copper with a one finger creamy white head. The head slowly fades to a nice coating.

This beer smells great. Its bready, sweet, and all kinds of floral and perfume. I cant wait to drink this stuff.

The taste would be hard to improve on. The flavors are like theyre coming from two different beers but they go together absolutely perfect. The first splash of flavor is sweet, caramel and just a touch of doughyness. The second explosion of flavor is floral hops and enough bitterness to balance out the front. It really is like two totally seperate beers.

The mouthfeel is right where it should be. Medium bodied and slick going down. Coats the mouth nicely. A good amount of carbonation tickles the tongue.

Drinkability is close to perfect. I could drink this all night with no problem besides the alcohol being a little higher than average. 

Ive drank this beer a few times prior to this review and I know it didnt taste this good. I dont know if its the batch I got or what but this bottle of Dead Guy is an excellent beer. Im going to go buy a bunch of these tomorrow. Its not spot on for style but it is excellent. Cant miss.

1845,"2007-02-25",2.0,"Rogue dead guy in a 12 oz brown bottle. I think this is my first rogue brew.  Interesting label on the bottle with the skeleton and all.  I am curious why they call it dead guy.  Oh, now I see, the Mayan thing. Pop the lid and you get the wonted beer aroma.  Perhaps it does have little perfumey hints to it. Once poured into my steeler stein it is slightly darker than a pale yellow lager, I think its orange with just a teeny bit of red in there. The head is off white and it is tinted some with yellow.  In the beginning the flavor seems sort of strong, but not excessively. Some malty bitterness and you can sure tell there is alky in here. I dont think heller is one of my favorite types. Carbonation is medium low.  This is on par with  Hofbräu München Maibock and Flying Dog Heller Hound Bock.  Seems to be well behaved but it sure does let you know you are drinking 7% beer.  I dont think the flavor of this is as good as  Nova Paka Valdstejn.  Finish is not as offensive as some IPA and imp stouts but it sure does have an ugsome linger that hangs around for a while.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

Quite sweet and fruity, and sort of bready/cakey. Like a baked confectionary. Nice. Flavour is quite similar to this, just filled out. Quite sweet, but never cloying and very drinkable. Mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth and creamy, like it leaves a layer on the roof and tongue. Theres a light bitterness in the finish, which is the first trace of the Saaz hops aside from a light trace in the back of the aroma. I really like this beer, and the sweetness is perfectly offset.

1845,"2006-12-07",2.7,"From a 12 oz bottle purchased locally here in WI...

The color of this beer was a pretty bright orange, with some haze.  The amount of head was not huge, but it had fairly tight bubbles and good staying power.

The smell was a sweet malty one.  It smelled like plain yellow cake...that sort of sweetness.

The taste was a big mouthful of maltiness, more so than other maibocks.  Very little hoppiness, which I believe is also consistent with the style.  I didnt especially care for the taste.

Mouthfeel was a little thin and watery.  Despite this, I would rate the drinkability of this beer as very high either based on the fact that I didnt really want to drink another one.

Second rating.  This 22 oz bottle found at Lous in Augusta, where they also have growlers of this stuff.  Amber/red body with thin white head.  Smells malty with hints of hops and alcohol.

Third Rating: Murky dark amber body with two fingers of offwhite head that leaves a fair bit of lacing.  Smells of caramel malt more than anything.  Tastes malty, nutty, caramel...

Pours deep amber with a great rocky cap. Aroma is unique and a signature of this hybrid beer. It has the sweet cookie dough aromas of a bock with the spicey-fruity notes of the ale yeast and just a hint of orange peel and herbs from the hop mix....great smelling beer/ale. Starts with a rush of sweet cake-like malts that are swiftly subdued by citrusy-herbal hopping. Fruity tastes are in the background as the finish comes up fast. The sweet malt drops away and a nice German hop herbal tone departs in the finish....bready-sweet after taste and a slow warming form the alcohol (which, surprisingly, is not hidden very well).

Mouth feel was  on the aqueous side for an ale with a medium body... and I dont recall the drafts of this I had at the Black Swan revealing the alcohol so easily...all in all a unique brew which bridges the style gap between maibock and ale.

The taste is different than you would expect having taken in the aromaa.  It is marked by a higher alcohol flavor with lots of carbonation that isnt my favorite combo, but I can deal with it.  Another taste is a a strong, bitter wheat.  The aftertaste is great which beckons the beer enthusiast to take another gulp.  I also noticed that towards the end, some of the flavors started to resemble a weaker version of a barley wine.  This is another great example of Rogues repertoire.","Boise, Idaho, USA","pinkzambia"

Be aware that the last few sips from the bottle have a strong kick that kinda takes ya back to that awkward moment when you had that HUGE secret that you had to tell someone but couldnt, or that moment waiting for someone to get out of the bathroom (as you do the piss dance, legs squeezed together, about ready to make a mess), or the first time you tell that girl that you love her and she says ""thats nice""- its kinda like that.

Taste is very juicy (orange, apricot, pineapple), slightly sour malt, decent amount of fresh hops, but by Rogue standards this is hop-mild - very fruity and floral, quick diminish, decent bitter/sweet balance.

The tastes are lightly of citrus and piney hops and the mothfeel is a cloudy graininess.  If there are fruits in the palate they are figs or plumbs.

The bitter backing of the beer stands firm against the blend of caramel sweetness and tart fruit notes.  Although it honestly feels a bit thinner than a traditional maibock (which is generally heavier in the malt arena), it is decently put together.  It is satiating to the palate, with a nice amount of carbonation to lend drinkability (in a session manner).

First off, like with any brew, this is 100x better on tap, the flavor explodes. Any time you can find it on draft, reward the operation,please, for their boldness and their taste, and order a Dead Guy instead of your usual local micro pale ale. But about the beer...Beautiful, big off-white head, gorgeous amber/dark orange color. Aroma: bright, fresh fruitiness, vegetableness, it's a veritable garden in here. Great hops, just mild enough, with loads of malt. I was confused about the style for a long time. I was led to believe that it was an Oktoberfest, but aren't they usually lagers? A recent trip to Oregon and a visit to a Rogue Ale House set me straight about the DG's true genealogy. An ale-style maibock! These guys are geniuses!

Taste is like a mix between an Amber and a Bock. Lots of caramel malt but offset with a generous amount of hops. I wish I had the 22oz instead of the 12oz bottle because the bigger ones list the ingredients. I'm quite certain that it has neither Cascade or Centenial hops because while the hop taste is definately present, it's subdued. The alcohol content is noticable but only barely.

I had some on at Bar Louies in Richmond.  Claire our bartendress said it was her favorite.  It was very good.  The higher alcohol and balanced hops make for a perfect all around beer.

Medium bodied, sticky texture, lively carbonation, and a dry-spicy finish.  Long duration, light sweetness, moderate acidity and bitterness.

I must say this is a great session beer, lots of flavor yet it seems to be relatively light.  A beer for when you aren't up to being assaulted by hop varieties and dense maltiness.

Sweet and bitter, smooth and chewy, it was a dichotomy of the senses, although the hoppiness is pretty subtle. There are no gratuitous flavors.

You go Rogue!  Nice Munich malt aroma to start followed by yeast, then light raisiny and a little bit of alcohol.  Other fruity esters seem absent even as it warms.  The Munich Malt flavor is interrupted very abruptly by the hop bitterness and there's some hop flavor as the beer heads down my throat along with some resinous hop mouthfeel.  The raisiny aroma does not come through much in the flavor and this beer seems to be balanced toward hops, which seems slightly out of my expectations.  It seems a little astringent due to overhopping and it also has a medium body.  Also not what I'd expect out of a Maibock style (lager or ale).

1845,"2003-02-11",2.6,"UPDATED: FEB 14, 2003 (11Feb2003--12oz.bottle)
Disapp compared to my recollections of this beer.  Though others doubt that this is a bock, I can see it; it resembles carbonated, alcoholic iced tea, just like Shiner ""Bock"". ;)
Pours with a small/medium head, off-white, spongy, mostly receding.  Persistent, fine carbonation.
Medium amber in color, with considerable haziness.
Lots of fruity esters in the nose.  Also yeast, alcohol, and faint hops, though I couldn't detect Saaz.
I found a yeasty sourness to dominate the flavor early.  Considerable spicy hop bitterness.
The body is strange; a full peachy mouthfeel initially, but always finishes thin and dry.  This doesn't improve as the beer warms.
Kind of a clumsy brew.  Needs more crispness to be a bock; more ""meat"" to be an IPA.","Stanford, California, USA","mpbro"

The Dead Guy Ale poured a very medium to darkish orange, but was very bright orange with mininal carbonation and practically no head in the light (the head lasted about 10 seconds, and that was with effort may i add). The taste was just a battering of malt on the tongue followed by one of the most god-awful hop bitternesses i have ever had to deal with. It ended very dry and unclean in my opinion..i like the carbonation aspect, but the maltiness is overboard, and the spicey/bitter finish is just terrible...it makes me cringe in horror..it almost has a grapefruity aspect to it.

1845,"2002-10-21",4.1,"8/07/02: Living in the Great Northwest, I forgot Rogue also markets this stuff goes by names other than Dead Guy Ale. Regardless of label, what strikes one immediately about this brew is its gorgeous orange-amber color; head has canyons carved in its off-white sea-foam. Aroma is fairly light--equal parts malt and yeast--earthy...Flavor has the immediate malt presence one expects from a bock, but is nicely bittered as well...The flavors are sequenced so that the traditional bock maltiness is not compromised, but then the complex roasty-bitter follow-up steps to the fore and a conspiracy of various malts and hops provides an impressive complexity to both the main body and finish. Carbonation is fairly restrained, which allows diverse array of flavors to emerge. For such a flavorful offering, it is surprisingly light as well.  This is not exactly your traditional maibock, but in true Rogue style, it blazes a trail in a bit of a new direction...Delightful! Re-Rate 10/21/02: Molasses tones come through more prominently in aroma this time around, and overall temperment of this brew seemed softer from my last sampling, but no less satisfying...One of my favorite Rogue offerings...","Des Moines, Washington, USA","KingPinHead"
