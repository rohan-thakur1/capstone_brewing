4458,"2016-10-31",3.5,"Brewed 2012; Bottled 2014; Sampled April 2016
A steady pour produces a three-finger thick, dark pink stained head. The beer is a concentrated red color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich red hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells musty, a touch mineral-laden, floral, and cherry like up front. The cherry character becomes much more prominent / dominant in the second draught of the aroma; notes of cherries that suggest of carnations, perhaps a hint of roses, cherry liquor, and a touch of something that is perfume like somehow.

 Lightly tart up front, floral tasting, and definitely fizzy, the body is a touch thinner than I was expecting, which accentuates the fizzy character. There is an almost woody flavor to the rich cherry character here, and the beer is quite a bit more tart than sweet; in fact this is fairly dry up front, but after a couple sips a touch of sweetness become noticeable. The ripe / bright cherry notes perhaps add a perceived sweetness here, and there is lots of floral character leaning towards carnations and perhaps a touch of roses. There is a mineral like flavor here, and something sort of like clay, and there is definitely a tannic, cherry skin like character here; this last gets a bit oaky, and provides a substantial tannic texture & skin/oak flavor as the beer warms up.

 This is actually pretty complex in its cherry character; like many a Kriek the funkiness of the base-beer is down-played significantly, and this doesnt quite have the cherry richness of the more fruit focused examples from the best producers.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Big sour cherries and almost as big oak in the smell. Does not smell all that sour compared to some Lambics I have had but it is a pleasing experience. 

The sour cherries are delicious. Just enough tartness to put a smile on my face. The oak is on the subtle side and as far as chestnuts go, I would have to roast me some to remind me of what they taste like; it has been many a year.

Intense yet inviting aroma with a nice balance of damp, musty funk, acetobacter and luscious fruit sweetness. Dry oak, cobweb, barnyard funk and a subtle lactic presence followed by sweet juicy cherries. Fruit skins and earthy pit along with some other vinous berries. Acetic acid but not overly vinegar-y/solvent like. Subtle cherry cough syrup presence but the fruit really stands out without being artificial and nicely counters the funk. Not intense but smells pretty damn good. Nice complexity with the bugs standing out a bit more as it warms.

Lighter end of medium body with soft carbonation and intensely tart/puckering sourness that lingers over the sweetness of the fruit, earthy oak, musty funky and strong acetic acid into a bone dry finish. Very tart, sour and refreshing with nice cherry flavor countering the acidity and funk. Slight acetic character but not solvent-like or too harsh. Funky bugs, acetobacter, oak tannins, cobweb and raspberry vinaigrette. Dry, musty bugs but could use more funk to counter the acidity and sourness. Oak comes out more as it warms adding to the dryness but not too charred or toothpick-y. Very prominent vinous fruit sweetness with juicy dark sour cherries, dry fleshy skins, and earthy wooden pits. Really nice balance and although the mouthfeel feels a touch off, the finish doesnt quite fall off like the other lambic in this series. Very nice.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

[ Bottle ][ 75cl ][ MrChopin @ Belmont Station OR ][ $25 ][ Duvel Green Tulip ][ 6/8/14 ]
>> Thank you Kevin. Pours clear inky purple, minimal foam. Nose is Belgian kriek, 3F or Girardin type, cough drop, Sucrets, anesthetic, flashes of dark cherry pie, cherry meat. Taste is salty, cinnamon, high acid, low viscosity, prickly bubbles, low acetic, big citric lemon, not as leathery or complete lactic as Cantillon, a bit too sour with no pithy cherry meat that really makes Cantillon LP Kriek the bar for all Kriek. Extreme citric makes this a lemon forward sour instead of cherry. Still, it isnt too phenolic or band-aid heavy making this an upgrade to 3Fs krieks.

4458,"2014-02-27",4.1,"Murky red hue with a minimal tan head, needs a bit of encouragement to pull out the carbonation in the glass. Aroma is bizarre- it reminds me of a cinnamon cereal, maybe from the chestnut? There is a bit of sweetness in there too, wood, cinnamon, grain. One can smell the tartness. This beer packs a wallop- slightly fruity and sweet, big mouth-puckering tartness, a little backyard funk and again a hint of cinnamon. Finish is bone-dry, lingering sweetness like after eating fresh raspberries. Funky, tart, a little sweet, a little herbal- I dig this beer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","smm"
4458,"2014-02-17",4.8,"Very nice new kriek. Carbonation was low but present which provides a nice mouthfeel overall. Pleasantly dry with no artificial backsweetening. On a scale of 1 to 10 from totally clean sour (like a Lindemans Cuvée Rene) to total barnyard funk (like a Hanssens Oude Gueuze) this one was about a 4 for funkiness. Totally absent were any off flavors from wild fermentation, no acetic/vinegar, no acetone, no enteric.  The cherry profile was pleasantly tart and complex. The flavor of the cherries used seems more like the American montmorency cherry than the Belgian varieties typically present in krieks, this is a nice distinguishing note for this lambic.  Almond flavors from cherry pits was at a moderate to high level and oak flavors were at a low to medium level. Aroma of cherries and oak with classic lambic characteristics of leather, cheese, lactic, and grain. 


Overall a great beer, I'll be grabbing more bottles of this whenever I get the opportunity.","","mrmiller12"

4458,"2013-11-26",3.7,"Brewed in 2011, bottled in 2013.
Appearance: The body is very murky with a raspberry hued body that is accompanied by a short pink head that is short lived. The head settles into a creamy pink ring.
Aroma: From far away the cherries really show themselves, but up close the aroma is very Brett like, lots of hay and wood with a very dry aroma. Its very odd its like theres a wall of fresh hay with cherries behind it.
Taste: Cherry is hinted at on the intro and throughout, sort of a tease with a fruity sweetness. The flavor is very dry after the intro, like chewing on hay and wood with a mild earthiness, but the sourness picks up by the finish to a slight pucker and bold flavor. Tart cherry lingers a moment and on the finish.
Palate: Full-bodied and moderately carbonated.
Overall: This is a nice beer, but I find that it is lacking the complexity I would like in this. The flavor is dominated by dry hay and wood with sour cherries hitting hard on the finish. I would have liked some mildly sweet undertones to add a touch of depth.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"
