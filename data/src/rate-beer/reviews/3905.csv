3905,"2017-05-07",4.2,"Merci à Marc-André pour le partage! Dernière bière dune assez longue série. Robe bleue, mauve, violette, opaque, dense et sombre. Cest de toute beauté et sans aucune doute, très fruité et texturé. Intenses arômes de bleuets, de tarte aux fruits noirs, de bois légèrement vanillé et de funk sauvage. Cest la texture qui me plaît le plus dans cette bière. Le fruit est si présent et le liquide si dense, que je ressens de la pelure de bleuet. Cest presque râpeux. Forte présence de tanins de la barrique sans astringence toutefois. Funk lactique heureusement bien balancé par un fruit bien sucré. Lentement je saurais boire une bouteille entière seul; chose que je ne saurais faire pour tous les produits de cette brasserie. Loin de là.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

3905,"2016-12-27",4.0,"750 ml bottle shared by urbancaver- thanks again, Cam! Pours a hazy magenta color, near purple, with a small white head that vanishes. Notes of blueberries, plums, lemon, florals, wheat, sourdough, funk, and tannins. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a tart, fruity mouthfeel. Like most De Garde Berliners Ive had, theyre not the most complex but some of the tastiest - and thats kind of the point, isnt it?","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3905,"2016-12-24",4.4,"Thanks Huhzubendah for sharing the bottle! Poured into a taster showing moderately filtered blueberry blue with white foam lacing.

3905,"2016-03-21",3.5,"bottle shared by a friend. poured a deep light purple colour with a sprizzy non lasting white head. well, as you can expect from de garde standards, there is lots and i mean lots of blueberries, oak, tart, acidity, sprizzy lemons, mouthfeel is full of blueberry, wich is in my opinion, a bit to much, it really is tart, i do love me some tart beers, but this is jawbreaking tart. its a bit carbonated aswell, wich made it a bit unbalanced to me.","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"

3905,"2015-08-04",3.7,"Bottle sample in the Blåbær line courtesy of Burspak. Thanks man! Pours very hazy bluish red with a small bluish pinkish white head that leaves som trace on the glass while dissipating. Smell is fruity with crackers, cereal, lemon juice, blueberries, yoghurt, moist wood, hay, minerals and lemon zest. Taste is heavy sour and fruity. Mouthfeel is dry, tart, mouth-puckering, fruit skin astringent and light to medium bodied. Finish is heavy sour with crackers, lemon juice, lime juice, blueberries, hay, dry soil and lemon zest. Very sour! That and the fruit skin astringency makes this rather hard to drink. Tasty nonetheless packed full with blueberries...","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate blueberry, lemon, yogurt, and funk. It pours hazy pinkish-brown with a small pinkish head that quickly fades to almost nothing. The flavor starts with a quick dose of blueberry. The finish has wheat, sour lemon, yogurt, funk, and must. Its light bodied with moderate-lively carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3905,"2015-06-01",3.4,"Draft at de Garde (2/15/15) - from notes. Beautiful ruby pour with pink head. Okay retention, no lacing. Blueberries ... are hard for me to appreciate in a beer I think, but Ill do my best. Aroma: Tannic, fruited blueberry tea. Herbal and medicinal. Moderately sweet; balanced by assertive tartness. Light body, average carbonation. My wife would prefer less funk, more blueberry. I can neither agree nor disagree. Overall: Sort of a spritzy blueberry pickle iced tea and tonic cocktail. Not my jam.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
3905,"2015-05-01",4.2,"Beer pours cloudy blue with a nice head. Aroma of blackberry, blueberry, very intense blueberry with some semi clean barnyard funk. Taste follows up, deeply tart, yogurt lacto, very complex with vanilla and oak character bundled with a huge berry presence. This is very very fizzy, which seems to do wonders for the berry. A very good Berliner indeed.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","simont1"
3905,"2015-04-05",4.0,"Poured a purplish color with aromas of light oak, tart wheat, lactose and some blue berries. Flavors are blueberries, funk, tartness, lactose and very light on the palate. Really enjoyed this nice and refreshing.","Florida, USA","burg326"

3905,"2015-03-08",4.7,"Pours a lovely deep pink/purple with brilliant clarity and a persistent pink quilt. Really lovely. Smells strongly of blueberries and some raspberry character. Lots of funky oak and tart sharpness. Oh fuck yeah. Nice and tart and sharp while dumping loads of blueberries down my throat. Finish lasts long time and is enhanced by the parotid engorgement that wets my palate from the tartness. Thin bodied with high carb and a salivating finish. Goddammit, I only got one of these, wish I had gotten more.","Spokane, Washington, USA","harrymel"
3905,"2015-02-12",4.3,"Purple color. Pink head. Sour, juicy, berries, lactic sourness, yogurt, lemon, blackberry, cherry. Freaking awesome.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
3905,"2015-02-10",4.2,"Amazing dense hazy pink/purple pour with zero head. Holy amazing awesome de Garde nose batman. Funky, cheesy, tillemooky funk rolls around with lie berries, both fresh and pie filling. The nose is fantastic. Hints of lemon, green bell pepper. Tart acetic up front. Malty medium body with a sticky end. Taste is thinner than expected. Taste is a muted version of the nose. Funky and fruity. Yeast, tillamook fresh air, egg funk lead to lemony blueberry goodness. Some fresh red pepper, fresh cut grass and zest. The nose is astounding, the taste is a bit less that is hoped.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
3905,"2015-02-09",4.2,"Pinkish red, with no head. Smells like red wine and citrus, Taste is sour, oaky, winey. The blueberry is there, but in the background and adds a subtle flavor instead of dominating. Really Nice stuff. Thanks to grownfool for this one!","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"

Body medium-lively, with a well-balanced tartness, lots of fruit but a lingering tannic tang as well. One of the better BUs.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","ericdevin"
