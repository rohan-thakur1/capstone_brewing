Light pale malt, with some mild floral hops, brett, oak, grape peels, and brandied light fruit. Mildly sweet start, and fairly sweet throughout. Soft bubbly feel. Slightly acetic with some grape peels. The brandy gives a strong presence and adds a light port to chardonnay flavor. Fairly dry in the finish.

2343,"2016-04-30",4.2,"375ml bottle - $11.99 at Bullocks Wine & Spirits in Marietta, Georgia.

Date Bottled: Nov. 5, 2015.

Appearance: Pours out a hay-hued body, fairly clear and capped by a slim, white head.

Smell: A tropical whiff of pineapple, a bit of citrus zest and sweet-smelling jellied orchard fruits draped in a layer of faint funk. Honeyish, lightly bready maltiness beneath.

Taste: Sweetish, honeyed bready barley turns to tropical fruits joined with pear and apricot (a bit Juicy Fruit-y) and a little handful of rock candy kernels soaked in brandy. As with the nose, theres a soft, funky, leathery element. Not overtly oaky. Stays a bit sweetish and still rather fruity on the crispish finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-plus carbonation. A little stickiness felt.

Overall: Pretty good. I never felt its ABV, and, while it is a bit on the sweet side, it maintains a free-moving crispness.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The flavor is again over ripe fruit, mild tannic oak. I dont know the significance of Portuguese Brandy barrel but it is here and gives a big sweetness. The funky yeast or whatever bacteria is here makes an odd combination with this sweet Brandy. The texture is dry from the wood.

Now let me tell you, the gash makes some of the absolute most refined American sours out there. Theyre one of the best. You can just tell they know what theyre doing and arent just two clowns in a garage with some barrels and some wild bugs of unknown origin. This one just looks great. Mostly clear bright golden, large billowing white head, lively bubbles. The aroma is lemongrass, Bretty funk, oak, and brandy. The flavor is tart, mildly acetic, citric, slight brandy note.

2343,"2016-03-26",3.6,"Bottled 11/15/15, drunk 3/25/16.A completely clear, golden-brass with light carbonation and an off-white head atop that is well-retained.Ill be honest, when I drank this blind and after when I read it was brandy barrel aged, I definitely had very different opinions. Prior to reading about it, I found it just a bit sweet, simple and possibly too strong. But I think the brandy barrel explains the sweetness and strength. As for the simplicity, its got plenty of fruit, citrus bitterness and vanilla-drenched oak. If you start thinking of it as a brandy-barrel curieux, it begins to sound much more appealing. I dont love Jim Beam barrels and this candy-like sweetness that the brandy adds, with rich tannin and sweet honey-vanilla is hard to argue with. Especially if youre a fan of strong Belgians. Has some light tartness to keep it a little lighter and brighter, even. Carbonation is soft, the texture is candy-sweet and overall its just a shade sweeter than Id prefer. I do see why others love it, though.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2343,"2016-03-16",2.8,"This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a hazy semi-burnt orange / yellow color with a slim quarter fingers worth of white head. Light messy lacing.
The smell took in a some subtle champagne yeast with sweet grassy notes and a sweet to bitter lemon rind and pulp.
The taste, pretty much copied the smell and came across closer to wine than beer in the flavor. Dry champagne-like aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonation was extremely high like a wine.
Overall, as a Belgian Strong ale, hmmm....yikes, I dont see it, sorry Allagash, not sure what happened here. Do I need to age this longer? More like wine than beer. Disappointed.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
