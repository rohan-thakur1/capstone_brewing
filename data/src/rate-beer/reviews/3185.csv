3185,"2016-03-13",3.2,"12-oz. can. Moderate carbonation lifts the scents of fresh grapefruit, lemon, and tangerine from the tulip glass; faint cracker-like malt and a surprising (and late-blooming) touch of jasmine whisper underneath the fruity hop tones. The beer pours a light lemon color with a brief head. Unfortunately, the taste isnt nearly as interesting as the aroma, as a rather subdued lemon flavor blends with bland lavosh and some grassy hop bitterness at the end. Light body. I suspect the age of this can (9/15/15) has robbed what I remember to be an enjoyable lager of its better attributes.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"

3185,"2014-04-25",3.4,"Received in trade. Reviewed from notes.
The appearance had a hazy golden yellow color with a decent transparency to it, enough to see a soft ever so small carbonation rising at a moderate pace, white foamy head rises just a bit and falls adequately like a normal American Pale Lager. The llacing is sporadic and kinda all over the place.
The smell had crisp grains, light corn, slightly spicy and has what seems to be some lemon zest (I think).
The taste was at first bitter but lends a slightly sweet side to try to come out. There isnt any aftertaste and it has a dry crisp finish.
On the palate, it sits about a light on the body and is pretty sessionable. Carbonation is good for an American Pale Lager and for me as theres a nice crisp texture rolling about my mouth and tongue.
Overall, hey, what a nice American Pale Lager and in cans. Holy cow, I only poured it out for a proper review, but honestly, next time if there ever is, well I wouldnt mind having this fishing and right outa the can.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish.

3185,"2013-07-22",3.7,"The beer sits in my glass with a little bit of a haze in a bright, yellow/orange colored body with steady, moderate carbonation and a fizzy, bright white head. It definitely looks pale. The nose is a great bouquet of bready malts, fresh grain sweetness, and a mysterious herbal, almost candy-like plant-like hop character. Caraway seeds? Coriander? My own hallucinations?

In the mouth, well, my first impression is how soft and smooth it is, especially on the lips. Man, what a great mouth feel. Some great, spicy, earthy hop bitterness is showcased here, softly decorated with a light residual sweetness. Hops and a touch of lemon/lemon verbena, perhaps, in the finish. This is extremely good, especially for a lager. This could very well be the best pale lager Ive ever had. Smooth, hoppy, stifly-flavored, yet still refreshing and super sessionable. Great choice of hops here. What an experience. Dont let the style dissuade you... this is fantastic, more like a bready, generously hopped pilsener than what youd expect of a lager.
