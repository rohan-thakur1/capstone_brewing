2663,"2015-09-12",4.6,"Bottle thanks to Clownoisseur! Pours murky chestnut, small tan head, dissipates fairly quickly with some lacing. Aroma is hella dried fruit, bourbon, vanilla, oak tannins, chocolate, raisin, fig, date, plum, tons of cherry. Flavor is sweet and rich, really HOTD-like in its barrel complexity and mix of dried fruitiness with barrel flavors. Full body, silky mouthfeel. A bit hot, but not bad considering the ABV. A real treat and a beer I am glad to have gotten the chance to try. Thank you, kind sir!","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

2663,"2015-06-27",3.9,"Black as night, no head. Rich nose. Spicy stout, rich and smooth. A sipper, and it deserves to be. One of their best.
Bottle from Mr. Kuhnhenn, thanks for hooking me up.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
2663,"2015-01-10",4.1,"Bottle shared by a friend. Black pour with a thin beige head. Aroma of chocolate, dark fruit, sherry and booze. Malty and chocolatey flavor with some dark fruit and roast before a boozy finish.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
2663,"2014-10-15",4.3,"On tap at Kuhnhenn and our of bottle: Pours dark brown, near black, amber hues in the light. Quickly vanishing head, very oily on the glass. Aromas are all over the place. Dark fruits, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, roast and bourbon. Very intriguing. Taste is much more balanced than I expected, to be honest. Loads of dark fruit and molasses up front. This melds into a rich roasted grain with touches of chocolate, anise, vanilla and oak. Interesting how the mouthfeel thickens as this beer works across the palate. Finishes with loads of oak and bourbon that never becomes too much due to the continuation of flavors from the loaded malt bill. Very enjoyable blend!","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"
2663,"2014-10-10",4.2,"Bottle thanks to mrebeks for sharing. Really glad I got to try this since I love both the base beers. Dense black pour with no head. Aroma is packed with rich caramel, molasses, toffee, vanilla, roast, and light chocolate. Taste has moderate to strong sweetness but no where near cloying. Rich flavors of chocolate syrup, caramel, molasses, black cherry skin, booze, toffee, and oak. Medium to full body. Super syrupy mouthfeel with no carbonation. Love this but if there was just a little carbonation it would be rated higher.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
2663,"2014-10-10",5.0,"On tap at Kuhnhenn. The pour is a viscous oily black, jet black, with a thin dark khaki head and spectacular lace. The aroma is just amazing. It smells thick. There is a beautiful malt base and incredible caramel and licorice backbone. The long term barrel aging just adds a super complex vanilla booze characteristic that I love. The flavor. Oh man. The initial blast is roasted malt. Then it moves through a sweeter phase and on past the nice licorice addition. The old ale character really comes through on the back half with a nice maltiness and great complexity. The barrel adds just enough booze for detection, but the vanilla and earthiness are out of this world. The mouth feel is like syrup. Trying to drink syrup out of a glass. After that, it balances beautifully and the light carbonation helps it cling to the mouth. The aftertaste is complex, malty, vanilla, and delicious. I love this beer!

2663,"2014-10-10",5.0,"Aroma is toffee, butterscotch, decadent, then chocolate, vanilla, amazing. Appearance is black, light brown head. Taste is 4D, super complex, then comes an imperial stout, with deep roasted malt, licorice, then apples, caramel, so much happening, all great. Mouthfeel is THICK, oily, boozy, lingering for days, great carbonation. Overall, a madman invented this concoction...god bless that man.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"

Bottle: The aroma consists of maple syrup, chocolate, molasses, caramel, brown sugar, and hints of roasted espresso. It pours a dark brown with some reddish-orange highlights and no head whatsoever. The flavor starts with chocolate, molasses, caramel, and a hint of dark fruits. The finish has moderate maple syrup, dark fruits, vanilla, and a hint of whiskey. Its full bodied with mild carbonation and a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Overall, super tasty that really hides the 16% very well.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
2663,"2014-09-29",4.1,"Bottle generously shared by Sparky! Jet black pour, motor oil consistency, with a bubble or two for a head. Wispy and magician-like, disappearing faster than Chris Angel. Molasses, dark fruit, cherry skin tartness, vanilla, and booze. Thick and coating. Delicious stuff but drinking too much will surely put you to bed, as it did I.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
2663,"2014-07-10",4.1,"Pours dark brown, almost black with no head. Aroma very similar to BB4D. Lots of dark cherry, fig, bourbon and alcohol. Taste matches the aroma, slightly bitter, but then sweet and sticky. Light carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Dark cherry aftertaste lingers forever after each sip. A monster of a beer that is best served at room temp IMO. Seems to be less boozy once it warms. Very good......

2663,"2014-06-25",4.4,"Loved everything about this. Dark brown pour no head little lacing. Figs prunes caramel roastiness brown sugar taste with nice toffee aroma. Little sweet but then stoutish chocolate. Can definitely tell 4d is there mixed with a big stout. Body thinner than I expected but still worked well. Some heat in the end. Light carbonation.","Michigan, USA","BlowOffTube"
2663,"2014-06-23",4.1,"Tap @ Kuhnhenn: Nearly black, oily, ruby edges, no real ""head"" on top, just a big-bubbled, tan collar. Aroma is absolutely HUGE. Sticky sweet caramel, vanilla drizzle, anise, sherry, sticky toffee, mild bourbon, burnt marshmallow, prunes & figs - huge dark fruit sweetness - wood, some faint char & cocoa dust... Jesus Christ, its massive. Very, very sweet taste. Flavor just as huge as the aroma. Mildly tart, bruised prunes just covered in a bath of sticky caramel, molasses, toffee, faint anise, oaky bourbon, vanilla, the list goes on & on. Burnt brown sugar, just a little roasty char, essentially the most ""stouty"" thing about this beer. Bourbon & toffee soaked dark fig & prune finish with lingering, residual toffee-like sweetness. Notes of sherry, booze, & wood resonate as well. This is like a sweeter, dark fruitier, heftier (if you can believe that) version of Bourbon Barrel Fourth Dementia. At 16% ABV, its the definition of a slow sipper, but one that I enjoyed quite a bit more than I expected to.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
