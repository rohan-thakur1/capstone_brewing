2930,"2016-12-17",3.3,"Visual: Pours orange-red with large suspended bits of sediment, no activity and no head, just a few bubbles clinging to the side of the glass.

Nose: woody apple juice with a some sweet acidity, hint of yeastiness, deep flavour. (lvl-10)-pungency

Attack: incoming dense apple sweetness, thicker mouthfeel, tangy-zingy

Mid-palate: woody apple juice, mild apple cider vinegar tang mixed with hidden alcohol, (lvl-6-sweetness)

Finish: slightly cloying sugars, juicy apple exhale

Summary: Quite an approachable sweet cider with bit woody apple flavour and a bit of tang and sourness to round it out. The sugars become a bit cloying after several sips so this goes best with a savoury meal.","","sulawang"

AP: Murky, grayish maroon/mauve color that lines the entire surface of the inner glass in tiny bubbles.
T: Sweet but kept in check so as not to be too sweet. Definitely not the sweetest cider Ive ever had. The flavor, that must be the Saskatoon, is quite interesting and tastes like a mix of raspberries and sour cherries. The regular cider/apple taste is colored by the saskatoon and it is a nice touch.
P: Super smooth, with basically no carbonation felt.

Aroma was a little weak. Slight ginger and applesauce. Pour was a beautiful orange/pink color with a thin off white ring for a head. Taste was bright fresh apple. Not overly sweet and not too dry. Somewhat thick for a cider. Light spritzy carbonation. Glad I picked this up!","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
