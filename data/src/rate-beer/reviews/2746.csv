2746,"2017-03-23",3.2,"Bottle from the Station Tavern, Cambridge. Deep gold treading near to the darkness of bronze. Pleasant apricotty aroma with toast and marmalade, and a bit of hay. Taste is a trifle harsh and metallic at first, then a jammy sweetness takes over. Unfortunately this is short-lived and theres an astringent bitterness to the finish. A mixed bag, and while its certainly pleasant I find it hard to get overexcited. Its just a lager (albeit a fairly pleasant one).","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"
