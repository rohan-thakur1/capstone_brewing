3738,"2013-10-24",4.5,"Cloudy golxen orange color with shit tons of bubbles that keeps a foamy head on top. Aroma is perfectly balanced and has good presence. It smells medium malty and medium bitter. Taste is perfectly balanced by a perfectionist. Its like a blend of amber, IPA and blonde ale in equal proportions. Medium malty, citrus, bitter, and biscuit notes all in one.","austin, Texas, USA","kidmartinek"
3738,"2011-03-16",3.2,"On Tap at Breckenridge Brewery Bar-B-Que, 471 Kalamath Street Denver 16/09/2010 As FS-15 ABV 4.9%
Malt aroma. Bronze coloured strong in alcohol and a little rich on the palate with a dry and very bitter malt finish.","Northwich, Cheshire, ENGLAND","DJMonarch"
3738,"2011-02-13",3.5,"What a head - light brown, frothy, and holding a bit of body after a while (and leaving behind some really solid lacing), this commemorative brew looks dark and dense for an Irish-style.  The aroma is strong, however, of sweet, light malt and sticky caramel. Yep, this is an Irish.  A little spicy, too.  In the mouth, however, this beer is (lets just say) interesting.  Its like a sweet Irish ale had a baby with a porter.  Very easy, smooth, and light in the mouth, its not what youd expect from such a dark beer.  Bitter, sweet, and almost dry in the mouth, it leaves behind practically nothing in the finish other than a trace of roasted malt.  A very wet beer, cool, and clean.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"
3738,"2010-09-12",3.6,"4 oz pour at the Flying Saucer beer festival in Kansas City. I really had no background on this beer when I tasted it, which was kind of nice.  Pour is a darker amber with a nice off white head that was pretty lasting in the tasting glass.  Aroma was malty, nice toastiness along with fruit sweetness and some bright floral citrus hops in the back.  Taste is a nice blend of the bigger, expressive malt along with the birghtness of the citrus hops.  Nice balance.  Palate is medium to lighter bodied, held up the malt but was still easy drinking.  Nice one, surprised when I saw this listed as an Irish.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
3738,"2010-09-11",3.6,"Draft at F.S. KC. Really tough to rate. Great tasting beer but really beyond the Irish Ale category in my mind. Fruity, hoppy with a good malt balance. Strong ""wheaty"" finish. A little hopped up and fruity for your typical Irish ale but tasty!","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"
3738,"2010-08-30",3.3,"Draft at Flying Saucer Raleigh. Pours a reddish amber, mostly clear. Nose is cara malt and a bit of earth. Minimal hops in the nose. Body is medium full and nice on the tongue. Clean sweetness that is balanced pretty well with bitterness. Not too exciting, but definitely drinkable.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
3738,"2010-08-21",4.1,"Tap at Flying Saucer, Houston.Pours an average amber with a nose of raspberry tart and sugar.  Flavor is strawberry jelly, raspberry sugar, and light sweet bread.  Coating on the tongue.  Delicious.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
3738,"2010-08-08",3.7,"On tap at Flying Saucer. Pours a clear amber with a small frothy off white head that diminishes quickly. The aroma is a sweet caramel malt with raisin and fruit. Thin mouthfeel with a sweet hop and light malt with a lingering bitter finish. Easy to drink, a very good Irish ale from Breckenridge.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3738,"2010-08-06",3.6,"Pours a dark amber red, with tons of foam, great head .. . a muffin in a nook would be cozy .. . quite a hopped up brew, an irish on steroids .. . pretty good, one of brecks better beers .. . hes not coming back...",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
3738,"2010-08-04",3.1,"Tap at the Addison Saucer. Brilliant ruby red appearance with absolutely no head. Aroma is slightly hoppy with some decent caramel malts. Flavor is candied fruit, citrus hops and blended malts. Easy finish.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"
3738,"2010-08-01",2.9,"Nothing great. Too highly hopped to be a true Irish ale, but I wouldnt expect different from a Colorado brewery.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
3738,"2010-07-27",3.0,"On tap at Breckenridge BBQ poured a clear reddish amber with a small lasting amber head. Aromas of carmel, fruittiness, light earthiness and light graininess.
