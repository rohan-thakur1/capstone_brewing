1551,"2015-09-26",4.1,"Can at 5.8%. Pours orange, with thick foamy head. strange mix of orange, slightly peppery taste. more like an IPA than a wheat beer but you can get the maltiness afterward, medium amount of floral taste. Nice beer.","Glasgow, SCOTLAND","stoutjunkie"

1551,"2015-01-10",4.0,"Can (labelled 5.8% ABV) at Spit/Fire. Hazy golden/amber body with a thin white head that holds well. Lively carbonation. Light lacing. Aroma of caramel, tinned orange, pine and bubblegum. Flavour of pine, blood orange and a slightly peppery finish. Medium body with an oily mouthfeel. Light fizz. Im definitely getting more IPA than Wheat, but whatever this Wheat IPA is, I like it.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","jamestulloch"
1551,"2015-01-04",3.5,"Sample at the Badge-Whore Bowl (OSU vs AL) tasting on 01/01/2015. Pours a slightly murky amber-orange color with a medium off-white head that diminishes gradually. Small patches of lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrus, hops and malt. Light to medium body with flavors of floral hops, wheat and grainy malt. The finish is mildly hoppy up front with a wheaty aftertaste. Decent overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
1551,"2014-12-14",3.5,"Can from ClaptonCraft. Cracked open for Lornas birthday. It pours cloudy golden-amber with a thick white head. The nose is earthy, doughy, wheat, spice, brown bread and wood. The taste is crisp, bitter, fresh lemon, grapefruit, light acidity, sherbet, earthy, wheat, toasty stuff and cereal with a dry finish. Medium body and fine, prickly carbonation. Well rounded and rather drinkable.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
1551,"2014-08-09",3.3,"12 oz. can from Oskar Blues in Brevard, NC. Pours a hazy orange-amber into the glass, with a soapy head that leaves window-wash lacing. The nose is grainy with floral and pine hops. Flavors are cracker, grains, a bit nutty and a bitter finish thats dry and... well, ""interesting"" is the best word I can think of. Its a sessionable quaff, and bold in the mouth, but medium-light bodied and active to the palate. This one is certainly different, but I dont hate the experimentation.","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"
1551,"2014-08-02",3.5,"16oz can at Brevard tasting room. Pours a cloudy yellow with fluffy white head. Aroma is Belgian witbier mixed with piney hops. Taste is pretty much the same Belgian yeast, wheat, and a hoppy back end. Not bad but nothing to write home about.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"
1551,"2014-07-12",3.9,"12 oz can from Fremont, served in a tulip. Pours pale orange copper with medium fluffy off-white head that laces well. Aroma is grainy lightly sweet caramel malt, with just a hint of herbal hops. Taste is similar: lightly sweet caramel malt, again with distinct grain notes: wheat, rye, and oat definitely present. Hops are there but only mildly bitter with light floral notes. Interesting as both of these breweries are typically heavy-handed (in a good way!) with the hops. Not sure what the story is on this collaboration, but a tasty result. Need to see more wheat IPAs, btw.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"
1551,"2014-06-17",3.7,"Draft - Fresh pine and light citrus. Cloudy gold with a rich beige head. Nice light grapefruit and pine. Light and sessionable.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
1551,"2014-06-01",4.4,"Draught, into a growler. Pours a mostly clear light amber color with a moderate white head on it. Nose is great and extremely hoppy - I get some floral and pine elements to it, as well as just a hint of some pepper. Taste is light, and doesnt end up being too bitter, though you can get hints of the hop profiles from the nose. Really interesting beer.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
