4519,"2015-07-26",3.9,"Tap at Beerfes Kamikochi 2015. Pours nice golden, white foam. Aroma is malty to the extent that this really feels like I can cut it with a knife. Taste is fresh, clean - and quite full. Malt profile is strong and perfect, its not watery at all. Everything is brought together with the nice bitter finish - not overly bitter, just enough for it to do a good job. Probably one of the best pilsners you can have.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
4519,"2015-06-05",4.0,"Tap at CBM Koenji. Clear, deep straw color with a perfect white head that lingers. Nice biscuit aromas with some light citrus and grassy notes on the nose. Average carbonation with a medium body. Taste is very biscuity and well-rounded with the hops shining in the finish. Slightly peppery and bitter finish that lingers. A really great pils and great Japanese beer for sure.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"

4519,"2014-08-20",4.0,"Draught at Bungalow. Clear gold, big white head. Aroma is fruity with nice hops. Flavour is very smooth with biscuity grains as well as a great hop balance. Phenomenal pilsner. Going to keep my eye out for this one again.","Kyoto, JAPAN","GenkiGonzo"
4519,"2014-07-21",4.1,"On tap at the GJBF in Osaka 2014. A crystal clear light gold. Big bready hoppy aroma, mouthwatering! Big chewy bready light malts and light green bitter malts. Delicious. I can see why this is an exemplary pilsner, very well balanced malts and light noble hops being fully utilized. Top knotch.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
4519,"2014-07-20",4.0,"Tap at GJBF Osaka 2014. A new version, made with 70% Saaz and 30% Premiant hops and German malts. Wow! Nose is solid, fresh, grassy and fruity. Not as pungent as all-Saaz would be. Bright, glowing straw color. Pleasant grainy and grassy initial, balances nicely in mid, bittering emerges in final with a tongue-tingling finish. Mild bittering throughout, but it never lets up. Great.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
4519,"2014-02-08",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2014 Tap at JBC. Dry and crisp. Grainy lots of wheat, touch of cream. Great starter beer. 
Second time, 6 months later. Creamy, initial grassy hops, wheaty. Great. Ultra drinkable, refreshing, tingly.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
4519,"2014-02-03",3.9,"Bery good. Strong lemony sherbert nose, quite intoxicating. Well oiled body, good balance and a prick of bitterness to finish. Excellent Pils.","JAPAN","jonno"
4519,"2014-01-29",3.7,"Apple, cinnamon and wheat aroma. Simple but nice. appears a light golden yellow with decent lacing. Carbonated wheat malt, balanced biscuit and bread with noticeable hop character. Strong carbonation with some metallic funk. Overall, very balanced pilsner. Nice hop and malt harmony. B+ rating.","Los Angeles, CA, California, USA","Thisis12ptfont"
4519,"2013-04-25",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Herbal Saaz and lean honeyed cereals meet, leading this authentic Svetly interpretation into a lengthy spicy bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the misty golden.
-Drinkability is high and balance is achieved from aroma to finish. Good stuff overall.
-The flavor profile is appropriately delicate.
-This is an authentic bottled version of a Svetly, although it would still be part of the second-tier of Czech microbreweries in terms of quality.

4519,"2013-04-08",3.3,"Draught at Bay Brewing, Yokohama. Clear golden - white head. Clean. Hay. Bready. Ok hoppy. Grassy. Earthy notes. Not straight forward, but nice and ok drinkability.","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Theis"
4519,"2013-04-05",3.1,"Tap at Bay Brewing, Yokohama. Golden colour with a white head. Sweet malt, caramel aroma. Flavour is citrus, fruity, hops.","Huddinge, SWEDEN","AndySnow"
4519,"2010-10-04",3.3,"Tasted on draught at the beautifully presented Heart and Beer brewery in the ideally situated seaside Nihonkai Club.  Sweetish, not lagered for long I guess, highly presentable, good-for-drinking beer.  Not convinced it would slip past the Reinheitsgebot.","Bristol, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","Tim Webb"
4519,"2009-09-14",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2014 Tap at GJBF Osaka 2014. New version with different hops. Huge bready malts just like in Cz. Big hops nose, great bitterness that balances the rich malts perfectly. It is not sweet or cloying or thick, just delicately rich and malty. Nice Saaz nose. Perfectly balanced. Excellent. 

Draught at the Craft Beer Festival in Ichinoseki, Iwate, 2009. 8/3/8/4/15
Slightly dark gold with a foamy head. Rich caramel malt aromagreat malt character, with just a touch of butter. Retrained hops, with a slightly fruity, almost citrus character and a good bitter finish. Really good balance, a good authentic Bohemian style pils.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
