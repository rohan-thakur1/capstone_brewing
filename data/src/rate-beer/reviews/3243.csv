3243,"2016-10-24",4.3,"Kolor:  Ciemnej pomarańczy. Piwo jest mętne. 
 Piana:  Obłędna wręcz. Biała, czapowata, drobnoziarnista. Cały czas pływa po powierzchni i ani nie myśli o redukowaniu się. Po kilku dobrych minutach osuwa się po ściankach szkła pozostawiając wzorowy lacing.
Dawno nie widziałem już tak trwałych koronek. 
Klasa! 
 Zapach:  Pierwsze aromaty są dość zaskakujące jak na Tripela, ale w końcu to nie jest zwykły Tripel, a New World Tripel.
Zapachniało chmielem Citra - sporo aromatów kwiatowych, żywicznych i cytrusowych.
Pod spodem czuć brzoskwinie, morele, a dalej za nimi sporo przypraw (pieprz, lekki goździk).
Mocno pikantne i fenolowe tło. 
 Smak:  Tutaj już nie ma najmniejszych wątpliwości, że jest to Tripel Klasztorny.
Smak jest wielowarstwowy i złożony.
Silne nuty fenolowe, goździki, pieprz, może nawet subtelna kolendra. 
Zdecydowanie owocowe z akcentami brzoskwini, pomarańczy i moreli.
Dalej w kolejce ustawia się zdecydowana sugestia belgijskich drożdży.
Na szarym końcu może muśnięcie Citry z jej cytrusowym sznytem.
Perfekcyjna balans słodów, chmieli i drożdży.
Goryczka średnia, dość wyraźna. 
Finisz jest kompozycją składającą się z przyprawowych fenoli (wyraźna pieprzowa pikantność).
Średnie ciało i odpowiednia faktura.
Alkohol kompletnie nieobecny. Nie ma nawet rozgrzewajacego charakteru. Niebywałe. 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Fantastyczny Abbey Tripel z elementami India Pale Ale.
Można by rzecz, że idealne Belgian IPA. Z tym że Belgii tutaj dużo więcej, niż Ameryki, a to duży plus bo we wszystkich polskich hybrydach w tym klimacie, które piłem było zupełnie odwrotnie.
Zaczne od najważniejszej zalety - 10,2% alkoholu, a pije się piwo jak lekkie Belgian Pale Ale.
Piwo pozostawia w pamięci niesamowite wrażenia sensoryczne, nawet dla tych którzy nie przepadają za belgijskimi stylami.
Smak jest bogaty i wielowarstwowy, od belgijskich drożdży, przez przyprawowe fenole (goździki, pieprz, lekka kolendra, owoce - brzoskwinie, pomarańcze i morele, potem trochę słodów i na koniec wisienka na torcie w postaci cytrusów pochodzących od chmielu Citra.
Kompozycja pierwszorzędna. 
Browar ma u mnie ogromny procent zaufania. 
Z pewnością będę chciał przygarnąć każde kolejne napotkane ich piwo.
Tworzą piwa wprost wybitne w każdym stylu.

3243,"2013-09-27",3.8,"The beer pours a deep and oranging yellow, with a head of medium sized bubbles that eventually fades to a scrim. In body the beer is opaque and hazy with no sight of the other side of the glass. The beer leaves a light lacing of droopy bubbles on the glass, and a slick set of alcoholic legs. On the nose, the beer smells like a bristling DIPA. Huge, popping citrus and pine gushes over the nose with light hints of sticky, hot alcohol and a little bit of catty scents. Grapefruit pith and pine sap really stick on the nose from this beer, but I only get a light touch of pineapple funk from the Belgian yeast. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and then drying and bitter with big, hot alcohol which is nicely cushioned by the other flavors. Citric acidity plays in alongside the booze, and provides a nice wetting on the tongue. The balance of this beer is a little boozy sweet, but the hop bitters do pull the beer together nicely. In the mouth the beer feels on the plus side of medium in body with a slightly oily mouthfeel. Carbonation is a little chewy, but bites at the start of the taste. The mouth is left sticky with a bitter, resin feeling and a dryness on the back of the tongue. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet citric grapefruit and pine resin, this unfolds into slightly cloying alcohol, spicy hops and some nice finishing bitters. Slight clove notes linger in the finish and aftertaste, reminding me that this is an American Tripel, and not a DIPA, but overall this beer is a nice blend of booze and bitters. The tripel character really comes out in the mouthfeel of this beer, but lacks a little in flavor, which isnt horrible. I do wish the booziness was turned a little down and that I could get some banana/clove/Trappist funk and other nice phenolic notes. The phenols in this beer are gentle beneath the bitters and alcohol, but as the beer warms they do come out a bit and add a nice spice to the beer. This is a great boozy sipper that will feed your bitter-beer desires.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

3243,"2013-09-01",3.3,"From the 11.5 fl. oz. bottle. Strange dating system. I thin it says good until 2014 but I am not not quite sure. The pour is a cloudy pale yellow with a small white head that fades. A good amount of lacing. The aroma is biscuit malts, some citrus, some spice and a little butter. The body is medium and astringent. The taste is a bit more bitter and biting than the aroma might suggest. Something is off about this. Its a Tripel but doesnt taste like one.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"

3243,"2013-06-30",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 25, 2014 Bière jaune orangée dorée, bien voilée avec quelques particules visibles et comme un brouillard en son sein, effervescence moyenne-bonne, large col blanc, très dense, mousseux, rocailleux, qui se réduit tranquillement en formant une riche dentelle sur les parois du verre. Arômes dominants de houblon fruité, pêche, agrumes, ananas, mangue, cantaloup, et autre fruits tropicaux. On peut percevoir également des effluves rappelant davantage le conifère, ainsi que des notes plus maltées rappelant le pain frais derrière cet abondant houblon. Le nez est très agréable et bien intense, mais on ne peut pas dire quil soit très complexe cependant, il est presque tout en houblon. En bouche, le pétillement sur la langue est plutôt léger, mais cest dune rondeur et dune onctuosité merveilleuse, cest soyeux et légèrement huileux au palais. Au goût, il sagit véritablement dune invasion de houblon fruité (pêche, agrumes, fruits tropicaux) tandis que le malt prend des saveurs plus discrètes de pain frais avec un léger sucre dorge. Lamertume est plutôt élevée, mais elle est agréable et très bien intégrée au breuvage. Étonnamment, lalcool est tout à fait imperceptible malgré son 10,2%. Cest sûr que cest un peu unidimensionnel comme bière, mais il sagit dun excellent produit de dégustation! Quiconque désire savoir ce que goûte le houblon Citra devrait se procurer une Herbe à Détourne de Dieu du Ciel! [Note : On sen serait douté, mais je voulais le tester : cette bière ne vieillie pas bien! Après un an en cellier, les flaveurs de pain et de levure ont pris le dessus sur celles du houblon, et lagréable amertume devient dune désagréable âcreté. Cest significativement moins bon!

3243,"2010-11-10",3.3,"In short: An intense and aggressive Abbey Triple that tastes more like an uber-hoppy Citra IIPA (with unfortunate cat piss side-effect)
How: Tap at brewpub
The look: Almost clear dark blonde body topped by a long-lasting small white head leaving lots of lacings
In long: Strong nose of citra hops.  When used more moderately citra hops has a nice floral and tropical fruits signature.  But here it is overwhelming and to me smells like condensed tulips juice, freshly cut apricots and cat piss.  Too much Citra does that to me, cat piss sensation.  Taste is intense.  Lots of apricots, pineapples, flowers, grass and passion fruits with an abrasive flowery bitterness that also has a light cat piss flavor.  Bitterness is very sharp and aggressive.  The Belgian nature of the beer is buried under a mountain of citra hops.  Tastes more like an uber-hoppy citra American IPA than an Abbey Triple.  It seems that I like this beer less than most people.  Something about me noticing a light cat piss aroma & flavor that nobody else seems to get.  And Im not sure what disturbs me the most here.

3243,"2010-06-05",3.9,"Drank on day 1 of the 2010 Mondial de la Bière. Clear blonde, medium head. Aroma of semisweet hops, notes fragrant herbs. Taste of malted barley weel blended with the hops, notes of herbs and a little bitter. A very pleasant and well balanced tripel!","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"
3243,"2010-06-05",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 12, 2012 My Bottom Line:
This hybrid of a strong ale displays lots of citrusy fruitiness dallying atop and within biscuity pale malts, while spicy, herbal hop qualities grab on to every prickly bubble.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the clear honey gold.
-Alcohol is very well hidden. This is actually very drinkable for its size.
-There are lots of pale malt flavors (on tap, not in the bottle) and relatively few dextrins (for a brew this size). Me likey.
-While the hop aroma is mostly citrusy, the flavors and finish develop intense spicy notes which are very compelling, and even passionfruit and durian angles (the good ones, dont worry).

Bottles, on tap at the brewpub and, initially, at the Mondial.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
