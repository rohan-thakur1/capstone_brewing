515,"2017-05-25",4.0,"Aromat: Å›wietny i intensywny, brandy i Å›wieÅ¼e maliny, suszone owoce- Å›liwki, figi, karmel. Aromat maliny bardzo owocowy i naturalny.
WyglÄ…d: brunatne z czerwonawymi odcieniami, piana na centymetr, grubopÄ™cherzykowa, jasnobeÅ¼owa, dosyÄ‡ szybko zanika.
Smak: bardzo zÅ‚oÅ¼ony, na poczÄ…tku Å›wieÅ¼a sÅ‚odycz malin, dalej sÅ‚odycz od karmelu, sÅ‚odkie owoce, figi, daktyle, rodzynki, suszona Å›liwka. PÃ³Åºniej wchodzi cierpkoÅ›Ä‡ Å›wieÅ¼ych malin, cierpki sok z owocÃ³w leÅ›nych, malin, Å¼urawiny, borÃ³wki, jeÅ¼yny, nuty wytrawnego wina. Na koniec zaÅ› atakuje ostre brandy i drewno od beczki, wywoÅ‚ujÄ…ce odczucie silnego Å›ciÄ…gania na jÄ™zyku. Bardzo dobrze uÅ‚oÅ¼one i zbalansowane, splatajÄ… siÄ™ tu sÅ‚odycz, cierpkoÅ›Ä‡ i gorycz owocÃ³w leÅ›nych, taka jak od czerwonych borÃ³wek. Laktozy na szczÄ™Å›cie w ogÃ³le tu nie czuje, ale piwo jest bardzo gÅ‚adkie i zdradliwie wydaje siÄ™ byÄ‡ dosyÄ‡ lekkie. Finisz sÅ‚odko kwaÅ›no gorzki, caÅ‚y czas Å›ciÄ…ganie na jÄ™zyku.

Nice quad (as expected) but heavy on the raspberry. Not really able to detect anybody the brandy barrel. A nice drink but a tad too fruity, and too expensive.
