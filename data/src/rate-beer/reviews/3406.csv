3406,"2013-11-07",3.9,"375ml bottle from my Crooked Stave Reserve Membership. Courtesy ship tossed via pussypete. Pours a deep brownish hue, well hazed and darker body. A gentle reddish cherry glow hits the body and throughout, dulled and darker with a bit more light on the edges and bottom. Darker hazy near murky middle. Frothy tannish head atop stays as a firm layer, sticks around and laces fairly well. Decent frothy layer is loose but decent sized. Aromas are and and vanilla, distinct house Bretty feel and Crooked Stave house flavors, funky and dry, a bit of cobwebs, tannic vanilla and bouron meet tart cherry, cherryskin, a bit off with that bretty feel, more weird than the other Origins with those cobwebs, dryness, basement and some suntan lotion. As it settles in, a bit more cherry, gentle toasty and biscuity malt elements shine through a bit more. Some vanilla, lactic elements, sweeter pie cherry elements. Firmer horseblanket, manure show life that seems a bit intrusive and out of place for me based on all the other Origins Ive tried. Initial is much more lactic and a nice black cherry flesh, firm lactic sourness, lemon hits quickly. Yogurt, natural sourness and lactic acidity are potent up front, dry, the house bretty nose feel shows a lot less than the nose where it was a bit harsh. Slick as some cherryskin and tartness work in, some gentle biscuity and toasty malts. Middle is still quite lactic, tart and a gentle darker slant, subtle dark fruit, gentle toast and biscuit. Some firmer vanilla and tannic elements show a bit of life, yogurty lactic blends in a decent way. Smaller body, goes down easily as its quite potently sour. A bit fizzy, firmly lactic as we round that corner. Sour, lemony, full of lactic life. Never. Gets acedic or vinegar driven, just a gentle Balsamic touch is quite subtle. Some dark fruit flashes, cherryskin, yogurt, lemon, and gentle vanilla, oak. Finish is dry, sour, and lactic. Mellow oak. I never get much of the spirit if any from the Bourbon, just a gentle vanilla waft, wet oak and subtle sweetness, no heat or ABV touch. Overall, the nose seems a bit out of place here. But overall the beer itself tastes great, is richly lactic, subtle cherry elements without making the Bourbon barrel ellement intrusive or hot as it can be in sour beers that feature it. Reallly nice beer but again that Crooked Stave house yeast nose, the brett, doesnt work on the nose as much for me or feels out of place, much more subtle in the body. Rich lactic potency, great flavors, flow. While the nose shows a bit of a mismatch, the beer is very on point.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3406,"2013-10-29",4.3,"Bottle  again, thanks to Steve_0 for being an awesome trustee! Popped the cap to a little gusher, but not out of control. Aroma is fruity with nice brett barnyard/earthy complexities and very luscious tart cherry. I cant seem to pick up on the bourbon barrel, but it must be pretty well integrated because the aroma is extremely inviting. Pours crimson red with small bubbly head and small lacing. Taste is very well balanced between tart cherry pie, clean brett character, and even the lactic yogurt like body others have mentioned. Finish is semi dry, with medium carbonation, plenty of cherry funk and low astringency - Overall very balanced in all aspects.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
3406,"2013-10-27",4.3,"Bottle with thanks to Felipe! Pours cloudy reddish crimson with a small off white head and decent lacing. Aroma is brett, barnyard and cherries. Flavor is oaky, fruity, cherries. Medium sweet, light plus tart with a bit of oaky astringence. Not really getting bourbon in the nose or taste, but this is a very well balanced and enjoyable beer nonetheless. Medium body.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3406,"2013-10-18",4.3,"375mL thanks to Shmeal! Pours a full haze, deep cola red. Weak foam. Nose is juicy black cherry flesh, Lou Pepe Kriek style no joke. Cherry pie, muted to no phenolic junk from 3F Krieks. Pretty much the closest to Cantillon LP Kriek Ive experienced. Taste is lime acid, pulpy, clean, still so close to LP Kriek it is insane. Clean, bright lactic lime yogurt palate. Really impressive. Totally different than the Raspberry Dark Origins, which has a roast/sour stout character.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3406,"2013-10-14",4.3,"Sampled at Dr. Bills tasting at falling rock pours a murky red sweet cherry and oak aroma. Taste is the same with big tart cherry bourbon and caramel.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","olr1984"
3406,"2013-10-11",3.9,"375 ml bottle shared by Mark- thanks again! Bottled September 2013. Pours a hazy, dull plum-red with a beige ring for a head. Aroma of sweet and dark cherries - very rich throughout - with some funk and leather and oak, and some sweet notes that bring to mind a pie crust that complements the big cherry here. The flavor brings a lot more tartness than the nose lets on, with oak, tart cherries, lemon, yogurt, leather, and caramel. Light-medium bodied, with a tart, funky mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Really interesting beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3406,"2013-10-03",4.5,"375 ml bottle poured a hazy reddish brown with a small lasting pinkish tan head. Aromas of sour cherries, spice, toffee, light citrus and a hint of bourbon. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a dry tart finish. Flavors of sour cherry, spice, light citrus and light bread with a crisp dry tart lingering sour cherry finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
