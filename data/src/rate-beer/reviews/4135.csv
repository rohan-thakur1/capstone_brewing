4135,"2017-05-16",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2017 Bottle #354 I think..it kinda rubbed off. Golden straw pour. Amazing apple and honey aroma. Balance is perfect. Flavor follows suit. Actually more honey forward than I expected, with apples cutting it perfectly with a light juicy tartness. Flawless for my tastes. An incredible mead. Ken truly is a magician.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

Intensely complex, almost ice cider like, apple nose with light supporting floral honey. Sweet, tiny sour & heavy fruity taste. Intense yet mellow & balanced.

4135,"2017-04-07",4.1,"Sample at Schramms on 4/2/17. Pours clear gold with some legs. Aroma of tart apple juice and sweet honey. Sweet honey flavor with a light apple finish that has some mild tartness.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
4135,"2017-01-09",4.1,"375 mL bottle. Bottle 97 of 516, waxed and signed, which is apparently how you can tell its Apple Reserve. Honey aroma is surprisingly strong. A little bit of apple. Tastes more like a cider here. Sweet apple and honey up front. Apple becomes sharp and acidic in the back end, cutting the sweetness. Smell and initial taste is honey and then apple takes over. Very nice.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
4135,"2017-01-09",4.4,"Bottle 97/516 signed by Ken Schramm - Pours golden yellow. Nose is apples, honey. Taste is lots of apples upfront backed up with sweetness. Very decadent. Slight tartness. And damn good!!!","Port St. Lucie, Florida, USA","biggsbowler"
4135,"2016-12-29",4.6,"Everything thats great about the regular Apple release, just amplified and in a purer form, if that makes sense. Superb.","","CountPrattula"
4135,"2016-12-29",4.8,"This is ridiculous. Alcoholic apple juice. Honey is in perfect balance with the fruit, as usual.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","FrankHammer"

4135,"2016-10-14",4.2,"Leftovers from the Anniversary Party. Pour at the Meadery. The pour is a clear light good with a bubbly collar. The aroma is a little hot. There is a nice cider quality in front of the honey, and then its definitely a bit of booze on the back end. The flavor is just as good. The sweetness of the honey is up front and then the apples come rolling in. The skins, the flesh, each in different waves. The dryness is nice on the back end. The mouth feel is light and slick with a great cider quality. The honey is linger on the finish, and it winds up like a pressed cider. This is good.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
4135,"2016-10-02",4.4,"Sampled at Schramms where it pours up with a clear pure gold body that supports a tiny ring of bubbles and tosses up like sheet legginess. The aroma offers up plenty of apple as well as a waxy earthy apple note and some honeycomb mixed with a faint booziness at the end of the draw. The taste is silky smooth and sweet and brings up an apple sweet honey richness that forces you to savor it for as long as possible. To midway some honeycomb like wax and fresh apple earthiness joins in and takes this to the finish. Just yummers. This would be great in pancakes or ice cream.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4135,"2016-09-18",4.2,"Tap at Schramms. Aroma is sweet apple syrup and light pear. Tastes moderately sweet. Smooth boozy apple cider. Great stuff but doesnt seem different than the regular apple. Would love to try this side by side with the regular.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
