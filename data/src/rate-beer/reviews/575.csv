En aspecto tiene una pronunciada corona de espuma aunque la retención no es tan buena, perlas compactas con algo de fibrosisdad, el color es un profundo color rojizo con destellos mas claros de la misma intensidad, cuerpo mediano en las paredes del vaso.
El aroma es bueno y complejo, de inicio están las maltas dando un ligero toque a chocolate dulce y a pan, la levadura nos da un perfil a clavo típico de la variante de esta bacteria utilizado en estilos belgas, licor marcado, tambien hay aroma a azúcar candy, frutosidad como a pasas, es lo que mas destaca.
En paladar es dulce con un final amargo a lúpulo que la hace seca, hay sabores distintivos a azúcar candy, corteza de pan, la malta obscura apenas y se presiente aportando un ligero y efímero gusto achocolatado, caracteres frutales como a uva, muy especiada y ligeramente terrosa, parecería por el aroma que seria una cerveza mas compleja, el sabor a alcohol se queda de poco en poco resaltando cada vez mas dicha característica pero de ahí en fuera fácil de tomar.","MEXICO","Yased"

De dubbel van La Trappe haalt bijna het niveau van de Westmalle dubbel. Verfijnd medium complex en met een een mooie lange afdronk. Het is interessant om dit bier enkele jaren te bewaren, het krijgt dan een meer wijnachtig aroma en smaakpallet. Zoals ik ooit heb geproefd bij een 75 cl. fles. Net als bij Westmalle dubbel geen grenadine toevoegen! Het bier is zoet genoeg van zichzelf en het bederft de smaakcomplexiteit en de afdronk van dit mooie Trappisten bier.","Waalwijk, NETHERLANDS","Batavi"

575,"2014-09-12",3.3,"The classic double La Trappe, with light beige, crackling head which collapses quite quickly and is almost completely gone in the end. Colour is a very dark burgundy with a certain orange hue, hazy after adding the deposit. Subtle but quite pleasant aroma of overripe plums, raisins, dried banana, brownies, toasted bread, iron, cloves, citrus peel, candi sugar, brown rhum. Taste starts sweetish, some candi sugar, candied fruits, pear, with medium strong, mineral-like and sourish carbonation, quite tingling on the sides of the tongue, otherwise slick and smooth mouthfeel, caramelly maltiness with nutty touches here and there, a bit chocolatey even but in a subtle way, some iron, finishing with slight toasted bitterness, some residual sweetness from the onset but not cloyingly so, leafy hop bitterishness and just a little bit of warming, gin-like alcohol, subtle and not disturbing in any way; also a somewhat dull sourishness lingering on, quite long. Sweetish to dryish in other words, but all -ish, if you see what I mean... A bit too restrained for my taste, but admittedly this is a well-made dubbel. Id recommend this to anyone looking for a typical example of the style in order to get acquainted with it.  Still, the La Trappe range cannot convince me like the Belgian trappist ales do, they just do not have the same amount of distinctiveness and personality, at least since Bavaria took over.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

575,"2014-07-19",4.0,"330ml bottle bought at Gorgeous Wine & Cigar in Yuen Long.
Looks: Deep amber brown colour with thin trace of dirt- like yeast sediments; Three-quarter finger head and crumpety light-beige foam which lasts for 1 minute; Excellent sticky lacing with small fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Sweet dark malt with very fragrant banana (wow!), strong vanilla, creamed cake, caramel, light pineapple, sugar, bubblegum, strong Bel yeast and faint grassy hops.

Taste: Mid to light sweet amber malt, with banana, caramel, creamed light waffles, strong ester, light spices, very light alcohol, molasses, strong Bel yeast, light lemon and lime, very light bitter hops and faint grass. 

Body: Mid to full; Slick, smooth and slightly creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Moderate amber malt, but the Bel yeast / esters work wonders - tasty banana, cream cake, caramel, vanilla and spices, just-right molasses, smooth as silk. It hits you at the right spot at the right time. Beautiful! 

Hoppiness: Faint grass nose, light lemony lime and grass in taste. Bitterness is typically low, match well with low sweetness for a neat low sweet-bitter finish.

After Taste: Slightly dry. Very easy and smooth to mouth.

Comments: I think La Trappe has a winner with this Dubbel: Its taste may not be as colourful as Chimay Red or as hoppy as Westmalle Dubbel, but its smooth taste, outstanding banana and cake-like esters in aroma and taste makes it very fulfilling and enjoyable. One of the top dogs, highly recommended!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

I get a rich malt aroma topped by candied sugar.
Rich and malty tasting with candied sugar yeast and fruity essence, maybe candied plumes. Alcohol taste is bold and in your face. Luckily the ABVs are at a more moderate level for this light weight.

Quite sweet with ripe, dark fruits; the plum & dates are here again. Rich with some spice coming through & nice malts plus good hops too. Some caramel & grapes round things off with a faint hint of alcohol as well.

Light medium in body with lively carbonation& a sweet feel that has spicy areas & a dry, smooth finish that almost seems creamy & goes down well.

575,"2012-12-15",4.0,"I have had this one many many times but never rated it. Pours an average creamy light brown head that mostly diminishes. Body is red brown and sparkles are visible. Aroma contains caramel, lemon, dough, raisin, plum, cherry and alcohol. Flavor starts off acidic (lemon and cherry) and there's a hint of bitterness, to be followed by sweetness (caramel, raisin) and the finish is light bitter and a light alcohol.

575,"2012-10-19",3.2,"Off white or cream coloured head and pours a pale burgundy; lacking in aromas apart from a touch of banana and toffee; tastes is overly simple, especially for a dubbel, smacks of banana with touches of marmalade, brown sugar and some very mild spice flavour, but these tastes dont come layered, theyre all just muddled together. Palate is too alcoholic and lacks any distinct flavours except for the obvious toffee flavour of most dubbels.

Hops impact is balanced, citrusy, peppery thus not overwhelming. Taste is nicely swinging between a moderate fruity sweetness and a decise bitterness counterpart. Finish is long, aromatic, spiced, softly alcoholic, moderately dry still somewhat sticky. Body is medium, while carbonation is sustained.

Taste is similar, with dark fruits, Belgian esters, sweet with just the tiniest hint of the character of something four (but without the sourness - Im perfectly aware that makes no sense).

A - Dark cherry oak color with a fairly large, bubbly, foamy, off-white head. Decent retention that settles into a thin layer of lace with thicker patches near the edges.

S - Strong dark fruit with a very vinous smell with grape, plum and fig being strongest. Some molasses and dark malt also comes out. Faint medicinal smell as well. Has a bit of a sweet, syrupy aroma overall.

T - Dark, sweet and toasted bready malt with some caramel and molasses and carob taste. Mid sip, some of the dark fruit comes out, with it being somewhat vinous and a lot of figs with some plum.

575,"2009-12-10",3.6,"Serving date: 2009-02-11. Served in snifter.

330 ml bottle with a logo and the word ""trappist"" molded into the glass. Interesting to note that there are two different freshness dates on the bottle. One is on the label (best before end of March 2011) and one is on an extra label (best before end of 2011) added by the Swedish importers. A rather significant difference between the two dates, but I think this one will be great quite some time after 2011, so its really no big deal.

Dark ruby color, going towards dark brown. A small 1,5 cm tan head that looks rather creamy settles just a little to quickly. It leaves minimal lacings.

In the nose, theres sweet malts and general spicy aromas, but most of all a delightful smell of fresh fruits. Some faint notes of chocolate as well.

Some phenols up front in the taste, but in no way sharp or harsh. Then some spices coupled with sweet and a bit vinous malts and fruits (definitely cherries, and perhaps fresh figs). Milk chocolate (that becomes more prominent towards the end) adds more sweetness. In the middle it gets a little tart. In the slightly dry finish there are warmth from the alcohol, herbal flavors, faint malts and just a tad of bitterness. Overall, the hop character of this one is really restrained. Very well balanced flavors.

Medium to full body. Rather smooth and calm, despite plenty of carbonation. Slightly chewy.

This is a great, slightly vinous, beer. Its very complex, but most of all its so well balanced. Very pleasant mix of sweetness (mostly from fruits) and spices, phenols and tartness.

575,"2009-09-21",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 7, 2009 ~ Purchased this 750-ml bottle from Franks Beverage in Glen Cove, NY. Pours a deep red brown color with a decent sized head that subsides rather quickly. Each time a bottle of a Trappist Ale is opened, and I take a sniff, its always a memorable experience. There is such a unique aroma from this beer that I cant stop sticking my nose inside the glass! Strong hints of dark fruits, malts, and caramels tantalize the senses. The taste is complex, but everything pulls together rather pleasing. The taste is of bread malts, figs, and grapes. At almost 7% ABV, I polished this off with no problems at all. Wonderful execution on the style, and will undoubtedly seek this out again. 

I usually will not comment on how other members rate their beers (because everyone is entitled to their own opinions), but, with that said, how can some rate this a C, or even worse, a C-? I understand there are better dubbels out there, but come on now, seriously? I wish some would just give this beer a little bit of the respect that it deserves.

575,"2009-08-10",3.4,"A nice dubbel, light with a good Belgian fruity, phenolic sweetness.  This beer pours a dark mahogany, translucent without the murkiness I was expecting.  The head dissipates quickly but sprouted nicely and left a bit of lacing and, at least, a fair ring around the outside of my goblet.  The aroma has a strong phenolic band-aid note, although its not unpleasant.  There are also strong Belgian stone fruit flavors, a touch of earth and a splash of rum.  Its a fruity, sweet beer, like a quad without depth and punch.  Again, that sounds critical and thats not entirely meant.   I dont always want to drink big heavy quads, but I still prefer them in terms of ratings.  While its more drinkable than a quad, it still tends to make my mouth turn when I take a large sip.  If nothing else, Koningshoeven deserves an award for packing this much flavor in a 6.5% abv beer.  It might not be the most complex Belgian flavor, but its a big, assertive sweetness.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Its been a good five years since Ive last had a La Trappe, so lets see how theyre doing these days! I vaguely recall either a 3 of 4-pack with a glass (that later broke). So many misty, watercolored memories!

Appearance: Pours a dark brownish-red, almost antique brick-hued body with a frothy, though somewhat short-lived, light beige head.

Smell: Dark malts and dark fruits tossed around in, appropriately enough, some dark syrup. Notes of dark sliced bread slathered in dark caramel and splashed with a bit of good, clean alcohol.

Taste: Dark, noticeably bready malts with a sweet, hearty brushing of both dark caramel and Dutch stroop. Meager hint of simple chocolate. Fruity mixture of dates, Concord grapes, and figs. Some woody hints along with a spicy dusting of finely ground pepper. A bit of alcohol heat on the semi-sweet, fruity, spicy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-high carbonation.

Drinkability: Paired well with the 1920 silent film ""The Parsons Widow"" directed by Carl Th. Dreyer. Still though, its not exactly the best Belgian Dubbel on the block, as its beaten out just barely, at least for me, by both the Rochefort 6 and Chimay Red.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Tastes of raisin, chocolate (which I dont understand), some malt, and thats about it (nothing like the smell in terms of complexity). Bubbly bite to it, with a medium body, and a funky after taste.

575,"2009-03-31",3.8,"11.2 oz bottle with an ABV of 7% on the label. This beer is a very dark brown with maybe some red tints with a lingering tan head. The smell is very fruity, chocolates, and also vinegar. The taste is malty and fruity but it smells better than it tastes. If you like dubbels, this delivers.

Bottle brown, 750 ml
Appearance: Head is huge, dark cappuccino like brownish - yellowish, pillowy, almost creamy head, dense, very frothy, body carbonation is rather soft, head is decreasing to a small froth so mostly diminishing but not rapidly, after some time. Body colour is natural rubby and texture is hazy to murky. lacing of the head is almost non - existant, very nice, juicy, fresh colour.
Aroma: Wet stone, earthy hops, barnyard, alcoholic nose, bananas, sweet fruityness, a hint of cherry, some plums, coffee, aroma has something heavy and unpleasant to me, i dont know exactly what it is but something barnyeard - old piss like or sweat, burned sugar, roastyness or at last toastyness, rather no wheat, some hints of malted barley, wine grapes, red wine.
Flavour: Yeasts and strawberry, caramell, burned sugar. brown sugar, cherry, plum, grainy, some alcohol warmth, malted barley&wheat, banana, bitterness, nice combination of hops and roastiness, full, rounded, nice taste, crispy, carbonation on palte is felt, finish duration is long, grapes, red wine, burned malted barley, generally flavour is more accidic, full and pronounced more than Val - Dieu because of strong cask wood notes. Body is full, like you would bite the grains, fruits, hops and cask wood.
Palate: Body is full, texture is syrupy, smooth, carbonation is soft on palate, cask wood is dominating with its accidity at the end.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

The Blond and the Trippel have been available in Croatia for years now but their dark cousins have always been mysteriously absent (the Dubbel might have once been imported but it definitely hasnt been imported recently). So, it was interesting to try those two. This one poured a nice red brown body with a thick off white head that went away slowly. The nose was pretty straightforward but somehow not easy to define. a maltiness that falls somewhere between caramel croquant and orange and some salt. The taste was somewhat simple and lighter than expected but well put together.

The aroma was sweet malt, with some yeasty tones, as well as chocolate and cherry hints.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied, mildly carbonated, and slightly creamy.

575,"2008-04-28",4.2,"Koningshoeven is one of the Trappist Breweries, so you can be assured of a certain critical level of quality and respectability. It certainly brings that, as well as an intangible pleasantness and cerevisial happiness. Its a quiet Trappist, but thats a point in its favor as far as Im concerned.

Served in its own goblet.
Caramelly brown -- quite pretty to look at. 
Pleasantly sweet -- never cloying, just the right amount of sweetness for a Dubbel.
At 6.5% ABV, its not so rigorous on the gullet, although Ive never tried multiple servings in one go.

575,"2007-12-20",3.8,"11.2oz bottle, courtesy of Degarth. Has the Koningshoeven label. First thing noticeable upon pouring is a huge, rocky light tan head, with exceptional retention and lacing. A never ending layer of foam sits atop the beer when things are all said and done.  Body is a rich maroon color that is nearly opaque. Nose contains fruity esters - plums, dates, raisins, figs, juniper berries - yeast, peppery spices and some earthiness. Also pick up some floral hints at the very edges of the aroma. Fore is very red wine like, peppery spice, tons of dark fruits and berries, with a constant backing from the yeast and a nice sense of biscuit or bread dough. Medium bodied, perfect mouthfeel for the style. Slight astringency. This one was very fun and interesting to drink, nothing spectacular but very solid and knows what it wants to be. One of those beers that feels very solid when you are drinking it, but the rating turns out much higher than it seems since the sum is greater than the parts.

575,"2007-11-18",3.5,"The Koningshoeven is a testament to the rich elegance found in well brewed beers.  The price may make your wallet shiver, but your tongue will adore you for it.  An appetizing fragrance of banana, vanilla and custard takes an inconoclastic stand against ""dessert first"" intoxicating the drinker with a strong breeze of sweet scents.  This is accompanied by a healthier celery shine, though it too is ultimately drowned in a delicious spate of chocolate and heavy cream aromatics.  As the beer vents its aroma from the muddy brown liquor through the thick, dark beige cap, enticing and inviting, I cant help but plow my lip into the head like a snow plow in a flash blizzard, piling up a mound of thick foam and taste sensations on my lip and tongue.  Respectively.  The sip begins with a trickle of banana and chocolate, evocative of a banana split sunday, before the fruity esters subside into ignominy.  After this sweet prompting, the chocolate persists with a new inkling of malts to further darken the quickly deepening taste.  Then the flavor resurfaces back into a lighter, fruitier stage, marked most curiously by the taste of artichoke hearts and a chalky palate, only to lightly land on a soft, pensive yet decadent chocolate aftertase, running with rivulets of deep, dark sweet flavor.  Permeating through the whole flavor storyline is a stalking and quiet hint of hazelnut which, interwined with the chocolate and sporadic fruit flavors is a wonderful flavor adhesive.  All of this rests on a blithe palate, light and carefree despite the rich flavors.  A contradiction, perhaps, but as such also mystifying.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Pours an extemely dark ruby brown with minimal head after a minute. The nose smells like my mothers chocolate chip cookies. Touch of cherries. Sugar is there, but that is part of mommas chocolate chip cookies. Malty subdued flavor that has a caramelized sugar edge to it. Seems to be lacjing something.

575,"2007-04-14",3.3,"Sampled March 2007
Pours with a brilliantly clear, dark amber, purple-plum color.  It is topped by an initially three-finger thick, amber-tinged, tan head.  The aroma has a musty, almost woody spiciness to it; notes of clove, a touch of allspice, damp bark, cola nut, and perhaps a touch of wet cardboard.

The beer is fairly sweet, yet has a subtle dusty chocolate note.  Quite a bit of fruit is here as well, with predominantly a raisin / fig note that is accentuated a bit by the light malt sweetness.  There is a touch of cola character here as well as a more typical clove character and a touch of ginger in the finish.  Really though the dark, concentrated fruit note are the dominant flavor here.  This brew never approaches sticky though, and is in fact quite light overall and fairly easy drinking.

Dark mahogany to rust brown with a yellowy head that fizzed initially, but grudgingly decided to stay eventually. In the nose stewed prunes cames to mind first, further forays revealing some spicy cloves and cooling, medicinal alcohol notes over a banoffee thickness. This theme carries through flavour-wise, however, I have to admit, at a much lower standard. I got a immediate hit of banana cake and chewy, spicy tofee, and some pleasant bitter herb notes play nicely to begin, though by the end they grate somewhat. Quite breadlike in a way. I also found the carbonation a little over done and prickly.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Aarleks"
575,"2006-11-08",3.2,"A bit like a bock for me. Poured a virtually clear dark brown with a smallish head. Quite malty, with some molasses and licorice notes. A little fruitiness from the yeast, but not as much as I was expecting for a dubbel. On tasting some caramelly banana comes through pleasantly though. Sweetness is well restrained, but the bitterness dwells somewhat which, with a relatively thin body, seems to stick out like dogs balls. Different abv from the details above (7%) - seemed pretty well contained. Maybe theyve changed more in the recipe than that?","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","bridge"
575,"2006-11-02",3.3,"BANANA!!! That is what i thought of this beer! The aroma is heavy with banana, and not so heavy with hops and malts. The flavor has easy touches of chocolate and caramel, but it never got as obvious as I hoped for. The banana is of course still represented during the rating of the flavor, but this time accompanied by some sourish notes. The beer has a good creamy caramellish and chocolate-full palate in the start, but it quickly turns watery and sourish, leaving the dreams of a Westmalle-Dubbel competitive beer, behind. The aftertaste is easily malty, with a lot of alcohol (actually too much, for a dubbel). It starts out really great, but ends up only above average.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"

Smooth and sweet with a subtle oiliness that distinguishes it from many others that have a demonstrable astringency.  Clean fruit and nut chocolate bar flavour that delights the palate.

Unbelievably silky smooth mouthfeel with a somewhat honey-like viscousness.  Amazingly drinkable despite its heaviness.  Finishes extremely dry with a pleasant sweet-but-hoppy aftertaste.

575,"2006-10-11",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2008 7% corked ceramic bottle. My first Dutch monk, so to speak. Uncorks impressively with a puff of fruity smoke. Glugs musically into the Rochefort tulip. Is it worthy? Apparently so. Hissing beige froth atop a mahogany, red-haloed body. Powerfully fruity,strawberryish nose. Sweet berry-like caramel, with just enough balancing licorice bitterness. No hops or alcohol. A little thin for the style, but the silkiness compensates. Possibly a touch too sweet, but just about holds its own against some of the belgian big boys.
(Re-rate) Outlandish yellow suds piled on ebony. Ruby tints. Head irregular and receding to a slick. Nose brazen liquorice, candy sugar, lurking herbal hop, almond, more outspoken banoffee pie banana esters than is sensible and monkish. Definite noble hops and banana like a dunkelweizen. Drinks like a toned down,  liquorice and candy-packed Kasteel Donker. Bready but a bit slick and sugary for this rater.

I obviously should have waited until I had tasted the four before rating them as this had the same toffee and caramel flavour similar to all of them, pity this was the only one that managed to balance it. Slowly poured it produced a wickedly dense and creamy, sandy beige head that settled in for the length and clung firmly to the glass. The body of beer a deep ruby red with the clarity of honey. Predominantly fruity aroma; zesty plums and berries, biting spices and a little nutmeg. Smooth and well rounded In the mouth with the dessert-style gooey toffee notes, which are initially quite pronounced, quickly balanced out with a mix of rich, dark chocolate, zesty cherries, burnt wood and slightly nutty, roasted malts. A light vinous note comes into play as it warms and follows through into the dry, malty bitter, chocolaty swallow that was easily the highlight of this one. It had after dinner beer written all over it. Not exactly one for a bender, but two or three would suit a good couple of hours as it was a delicious slow sipper.

I noticed the fluffy beige head quickly reducing to a thin film, yet it produced amazingly sticky lacing - much like the Quadrupel. In fact the whole appearance was very reminiscent of its big brother, pouring a clear but deep ruby tone. The aroma as well hinted at the familiar pears and sweet cream found in La Trappes showpiece. However the key element in the nose was a strong dried banana fragrance, almost like opening a package of bar mix. In the blend I also found coffee, white raisins and pine, maybe even coniferous sap. The flavor reverberated the dried fruit aroma, especially banana and white raisins which are immediately apparent.

Alround great beer, not hitting any new levels of goodness as there r better out there, but nice and refreshing to see a trappist ale that u can have a few of without falling off your seat.","bantervile, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","DonMagi"
575,"2005-05-12",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2006 This was an early favorite of mine, but it has not held up well as my beer experience has grown.  I suspect as well that this beer is not what it once was. Sampled from a 25 oz brown bottle this beer poured an opaque dark brown with lots of little floaters and a huge tan head. The aroma is musty, sweet, and has a molasses element.  The flavor is sweet with molasses and has a yeasty tang. There is a light fruitiness and some vanilla and chocolate. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"

The flavor reminds me a lot of Victorys V10. Ok, maybe its the much younger V10 that reminds me of this beer. Rich, sticky-sweet malt with bursts of caramel, milk chocolate and a dark fruit/fuzzy fruit blend up front. Slightly sweet, slightly tart and just a whisper of the hop addition on the backside.
Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel. Fizzy carbonation with BIG bubbles. Long, creamy, semi-sweet, fruity finish. Awesome beer. Some seem to have knocked this beer down a few notches since the brewing location was switched to Holland. It must have been ambrosia previously. Get your hands on this beer. Its underrated at 3.67 (currently).","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

Color is a reddish brown/copper color, depending on the light it may look like coca-cola in the glass.  The taste is a little more hoppy and sour than some others of this style, more citrus and yeast as well.  If one drinks this with food, it becomes musty and rootbeer-like, and I like those flavors here.  Alcohol and acidic flavors normally dominate the finish, which to me is surprising considering the ABV of 6.5.  I do like how easy it is to drink, though, and unlike some others before me I am a fan of the grapefruity hops...a big fan.
