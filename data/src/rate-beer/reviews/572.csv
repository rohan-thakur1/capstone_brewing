The aroma takes on some dates, plums, raisins, figs, brown sugar, Belgian yeastiness, sweet breadiness, red delicious apples, light Belgian spices slight chocolate and then a warm boozy spread sticking all around those previously mentioned aromas.
The flavor take all of those previously mentioned aromas and surrounds with a nice sticky bready to spicy and sweet aftertaste running into a quick finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice crisp smooth sweet yet spicy sort of sliding feel.

572,"2016-04-11",3.8,"Bottle dated Oct. 19, 2015, consumed in Feb. 2016: Clear garnet. Persistent dirty-white foam. Attractive aroma of molasses, hazelnut, fennel, pepper, plum and unsweetened chocolate. Hint of passionfruit and melanoidins. Sharply expressive phenols throw an abundance of pepper which is quickly met by a sturdy maltiness which gracefully presents its rich melanoidins, silky unsweetened chocolate and a splash of creamed coffee. Pervasive peppery notes cleanse the palate and keep the sugars perfectly at bay. Malt is complex and pillowy from start to finish, and is seamlessly interwoven with the bright and polished fruity succulence. Finishes well malted and cleanly attenuated, yet very little sweetness lingers amid the everlasting pepper and vibrant plum notes. Another winner from Tröegs in the Belgian ale department. Superb balance, nicely concealed alcohol, and the malt is soft and sumptuous. Dubbels are insufferably sweet and sloppy more often than not, but as with their delightful Tripel, this is devoid of any of those flaws.

4.0 A: Murky dark mahogany color. Two fingers of frothy tan head. Retention is pretty good and a finger of lacing is left.

3.75 S: I read some reviews before buying and was intrigued by people saying this is smoky. Well, it is! Smokiness is right up there with raisin, plum, and fig fruitiness. Toffee and caramel next with chocolate undertones. Pleasant and complex, but perhaps a bit too subtle.

3.75 T: Tastes like it smells. Complex mix of smoke, raisin, plum, fig, date, toffee, caramel, chocolate. Im a bit lazy today.

3.75 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Pleasantly spritzy and light on the tongue.

Aftertaste is a little on the simplistic and mild side with not enough complexity for the style, but in general - too one-dimensional with caramel and a touch of sweetness overlayed by malt. Overall, a decent dubbel, but that isnt saying much - doesnt compare with even the worst of the real belgie dubbles and only is about average with the middle of the line versions from America - so not really worth searching out for, unless you really like the style and want to compare it against real belgian dubbels.

572,"2015-04-05",3.3,"50th rating of this beer from a 375mL bottle, corked and caged. Nose dusty, chocolate, some raisin, deep glaze, but dry; there are some candylike elements as well. Pours beautiful deep ruby/garnet and supports a huge, foamy-rocky tan head. Taste very fruity, jammy, extremely ester-heavy with some boozy alcohol showing, but no burn; faint spice and thin yeast-yeast flavor, come milder citrus in the middle, smooth if slightly fizzy medium body, touch minerally, low bitterness. Its dry on the whole but there are some sweeter elements that flash forward every now and then (is that orange peel? candied?), and the sugary/alcohol character is raspy and rough. Still, a nice little step forward for the boys.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

It appears that New Belgium will soon have their East Coast brewery up and running and will kill this one both on flavor and price point, but probably not on bottle style.
