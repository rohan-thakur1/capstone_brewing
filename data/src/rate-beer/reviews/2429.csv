2429,"2015-12-23",4.1,"Vintage 2012. Le nez est fruité comme pas un. Fraises, pommes, agrumes et autres fruits du verger se fondent dans une délicieuse sauce de sucre caramélisé. Le corps dense et riche transporte des saveurs fruitées assez plaisantes qui sortent un peu des sentiers battus. Enfin, pour moi, pour ma petite expérience personnelle dans le merveilleux monde des cidres de glace. Bel équilibre en finale. Un produit tout à fait délicieux.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
2429,"2015-12-13",4.2,"2 oz sample from bottle (375 ml) at home. 2012 vintage. Clear bright golden with orangey tints leaving some nice legs on the glass. Aroma features some really nice berries along with red apples, musty notes, cinnamon, brown sugar, apple juice... quite complex! Taste is also red berries-forward with moderate sweetness, a bright but still not too intense acidity, apple pie, cinnamon, brown sugar and a bit of alcohol. Medium body. Oily mouthfeel and a bit tannic. Fruity/berries finish. Gentle and pleasant alcohol warmth. I wasnt expecting much from this ice cider after the weird old ladies vibe at the cidery but this is nothing short of stellar! The most red berries forward ice cider I have tried so far. Really tasty, quite complex and with a very well dosed alcohol presence. Awesome!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
