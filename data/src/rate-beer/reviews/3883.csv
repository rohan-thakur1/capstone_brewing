3883,"2017-04-30",4.0,"Une bière orangée, complètement voilée, avec une mince ligne de carbonatation. Au nez, cest ultra fruité, avec beaucoup de mangues et de fruit de la passion bien présents. En bouche, je marque dabord beaucoup de pêches, avec une certaine amertume qui est assez présente. Ca a définitivement la buvabilité dune Trillium avec sa levure de IPA signature. Ultra buvable.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"
3883,"2017-04-13",4.2,"16 oz can. 10 days old. Looks just like every other Trillium APA or IPA. Aroma is the house yeast, soft pale grains, grape skins, juicy orange, pineapple. Wow...
The flavor is just as juicy as the aroma would lead me to believe. Kind of a danky yeast, not pine but maybe dusty hay. Whole grape skins, pineapples, and oranges. Bitterness is low. Nice soft mouthfeel that I come to expect from this brewery. Plus I personally love the Nelson Sauvin hop variety. Love this!","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3883,"2017-04-13",3.8,"Murky waxy yellow color out of the can with a short lived white head. Pinching hop resin and tropical fruit nose. This is another hop dominant IPA, with an actual hop burn on my tongue. Melon, pineapple, red grapefruit juice, and tropical fruit hops over some malty sweetness. If you like hops this has lots of them....","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
3883,"2017-04-02",4.3,"Tasted from can. Pours a hazy yellow gold. Aroma is some lemon, floral and melons. Well balanced and not overly bitter. Flavors are big citrus with some sweet caramel and cracker malt backbone to balance. Very well done IPA. Definitely top tour.

3883,"2017-03-25",4.0,"Tasted on 3/24/17 from a 16oz can, big thanks to Alex. Pours cloudy orange with a thick off-white head that slowly recedes to average, sticky lace. The nose is tangerine juice, guava, grapefruit peel, dank grass, and just a hint of malt. The flavor is much more focused on the dank grass and grapefruit, kicking off some decent bitterness, with the orange coming through more pithy, and just a hint of tropical fruit on the back of the palate. The body is nearly full with an oily texture, average carbonation, and a long nicely bitter grapefruit peel, orange pith, and grassy finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

3883,"2017-03-06",4.1,"16 oz. can from seeswo - thanks again, Chris! Pours a hazy (!) light orange with a finger of soft, frothy white head that settles into a thick uneven ring and island of film while lacing the glass a bit. Has that dank herb in the aroma, not just the hazy IPA juice thing, with a little pine and pepper, floral resin, orange zest, grapefruit, pineapple, and melon. Medium-bodied, with light carbonation and a bitter, citrusy, slightly juicy mouthfeel. Another excellent one.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

3883,"2017-01-08",3.9,"Can from a trade. Canned 12/22/16-""cotton-headed ninny muggins"". Pours super hazy deep orange, white sudsy head. Aroma is slightly sour funky, (couldnt place it at first but after seeing the label, its white grape), kiwi, peach, dank, catty, green onion. Flavor is orange, grapefruit, pineapple, more white grape, dank, green onion. Fairly soft mouthfeel. Increasingly dank as it warms. Improves as it warms a bit in my opinion. Not my favorite Trillium brew, but would be a top beer from almost any other brewery.","New York, USA","SG111"

3883,"2016-10-04",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2017 4 pack drunk over the course of exactly one month, 8/25-9/25/16, roughly one week apart.Typical fort point appearance: heavily hazy, big, fluffy, white head, great retention.Oh lord, what a nose!! Its probably the funkiest Nelson nose Ive experienced, with just incredible amounts of riesling/gruner-like minerality. Mossy limestone, meyer lemon, guava, nectarine.....very high strength of aroma with only light biscuit/cracker malts behind it, not getting in the way. No alcohol or flaw. The aroma was pretty solid and consistently amazing up until the last can on 9/25 (one month old) where it finally fell off a bit (though it still smelled fantastic, just lost a lot of intensity/complexity).The flavor is lovely as well, as would be expected, with funky, earthy, mineral-rich notes and good acidity without any resin. Nice dryness to it; it seems to come off even more dry than most of the other fort points and of course the texture is soft and comforting, the carbonation low-to-moderate but very tight. Lime, guava, limestone, calcium, older riesling notes....just awesome, though I think the nose just slightly outdoes the flavor. Really incredible beer right up there with the best batches of any Fort Point. Cant wait until Batch 2!  9/5/8/5/17Batch 2 and 3Batch 2 was a big let down and borderline not enjoyable.  I think this was a very subpar/older batch of Nelson, because all of their Nelson beers that came out around this time had the same heavily estery/boozy/sharp character.  Intense almost rose-like wine with some chalkiness and even resin.  Batch 3 proved quite a bit better, though still no where near the aromatic perfection of batch 1.  Rating is a rough average of the three.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The nose shows a mix of rich tropical fruit - mango, guava, and pineapple. This is amazing. 

The palate is fully carbonated and light bodied with a quickly dissipating light zestiness. Light flavors of tropical fruit with a light pine resin bitterness. A bit thinner on flavor but still a great beer.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
