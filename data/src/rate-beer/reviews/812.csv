812,"2016-10-23",3.5,"Golden color with a smaller, but stable white head. Attractive flow of bubbles. Sweet scents with caramel and hops. Hop scents of herbs and grass. Sweet start with some citrus and circus peanuts. Thicker feel, but enough effervescence so its not mouthcoating or chunky. More herbal in the finish and slightly peppery in the linger. Ive often stated that an imperial lager/pils is a malt liquor. I still think that, but this is a decent noble hopped malt liquor.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

812,"2016-08-13",4.0,"The ol Lagunitas trick of HOP EVERYTHING TO HELL continues to work great. For me, anyway. Imperial Pils has hazy gold looks and and a white, pillowy head thats totally appropriate for Pils. It smells dank, bready, boozy, and spicy. The flavors are herbal, grassy, and grainy. Dry, bitter, crisp, and sticky textures. No surprises here - just plenty of good drinking.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

812,"2015-12-31",3.1,"Appearance: Pours a crystal clear, yellow-hued body with a medium-small, white, foaming head.

Smell: Pilsner malts with a little oxidation showing and hoppy hints of citrus (leaning a little orange) and some herbal-toned hops.

Taste: Pils malt, still a bit sweet and still hinting at some oxidative sherry-like tastes. Citrusy, orangey hops, even, with a bit of spicy dried herbs and some bitterness to temper the sweetness upfront. Drying in the finish, though some sweetness does remain, and, when hitting those hops, touches on some orange marmalade.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation.

Overall: I will always say taking a refreshing style and doubling/imperializing it does not make it twice as refreshing, but, still, it thankfully didnt veer into an area that was too sweet, too hot or too gloopy in body. Still, Id so much rather drink their basic PILS than then this.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The taste begins rich with sweet near sugary malts, a blast of bitter yet somewhat malt sweetened floral hops and then pear to apple to honey sweet booze.

This is too sweet for the Pilsner family. Better attenuation would correct, perhaps requiring a yeast change or a raise in fermentation temperature.

Aroma is mild but has a fragrant whiff of hops while a notice of grains and oat like malt lurk in the background. The body of the beer is heavy and taste of alcohol while also delivering a green hop pellet flavoring. Towards the finish, harsh flavors come out and remind me of swallowing cough syrup or some other kind of astringent medicine that isnt that pleasant while drinking a whole bomber of a beer. The high ABV is doing what it is supposed to on my CNS and because it was only $5 and change for a bomber well worth it the flaws.

812,"2015-10-04",3.6,"This was poured into a pilsener glass.
The appearance was a burnt yellow color. Light carbonation could be seen rising to fill a rapidly dissipating one fingered head. Lacing was messy with a semi-thick appeal to it.
The smell starts off with a sweet grassiness rolling into some light delicate malt (slightly like corn).
The taste was moderately sweet and taking the sweet grassiness to blend in a slight grainy sort of fashion. Theres a semi-smooth sweet grassy edge to the aftertaste and riding into the aftertaste.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonation feels good for the style and for me. Its sticky, but not cloying.

812,"2015-09-05",4.0,"Poured from bottle into a snifter
 Appearance  The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a big three finger white foam head. The head has a fantastic level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is quite strong of a sweeter tangerine and orange aroma with a decent showing of some other more bready and doughty smells. Other fruit aromas of a tropical nature as well as a little bit of an earthy and grassy hop nature are there as well, giving it a rather sweet and inviting smell overall. 
 Taste  The taste begins much drier then what I was anticipating form the nose. It begins with a rather strong cracker malt taste mixed with a bit of fruity sweetness of an apple and tangerine nature. Upfront the hop is light, but some flavors of an herbal and grassy nature develop as the taste moves forward. All the while, the sweeter flavors upfront lose a bit of intensity all while more hop and a bit of a alcohol booziness comes to the tongue. With these transitions also comes some lighter notes of a melon flavor and a bit of a floral flavor right at the end, leaving one with a somewhat warming and surprisingly fruity and somewhat dank hopped cracker malt taste to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the averages side in terms of its thickness with a carbonation level that is on the average side as well. While a little thicker body may have been better for the lighter hop tastes (accentuating them a bit), the feel was pretty good overall, as it did nicely for the slightly sweet and more cracker like tastes of the brew.
 Overall- I have to say I rather enjoyed this beer. Lagunitas never really lets me down. This is another great brew with tons of flavor at a great price for a bomber.","","Darkmagus82"

812,"2015-08-15",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2015 Im really not sure what more could have been done to the pils style of beer that would make it more enjoyable than what has been done here. I get the bite that all pils should have (kinda peppery), Its got the clear golden pils look, got the little bit of dry. But then they fattened it up with some hops and a nice strong alcohol content (8.6%).
