312,"2017-06-09",4.2,"On tap at HF. Beautiful beer that just nails every component of what makes a DIPA work. Its got a soft, full mouthfeel that is balanced by just the right amount of carbonation. The malt comes through somewhat, giving some grain and toast, but it never gets cloying or sweet. And the hops are pungent and come blasting through. Ive never had Nelson taste this good -- its a little earthy, but theyve also brought out a big tropical fruit aroma from the hop, and it works brilliantly.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
312,"2017-06-07",4.3,"Pours hazy pineapple into a shaker. Bright white head with medium retention recedes leaving trailing sheets. Tropical fruit and hay aromas. Soft with sweet caramel, dough and hay upfront turning to fruity mango, pineapple and passion fruit goodness before the lasting pith finish. Oboy.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
312,"2017-06-03",4.3,"12 ounces glass on tap at Blackback Pub. Aroma: nice citrusy aroma, lots of oranges, light cereals. App: really hazy apricot, medium white head, little retention, little lacing.

312,"2017-06-01",4.6,"Growler from Hill Farmstead today, opened a few hours after our visit to the brewery. This beer is magical. Hazy pale, golden pour. Thick white head with great retention and lacing. Aroma showcases Nelson beautifully -- tropical, melon, tangerine, pineapple, grape, light herb. So sexy. Taste is full on Nelson in a glass, moderate sweetness, little perceptible bitterness (just a smidge coming through in the end). Full- body, pillowy soft texture, soft gentle carbonation. Overall: this beer completely blew me away. Goddamn.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
312,"2017-05-23",4.3,"Growler share with Henry.
Both glasses were poured into tulips.
The appearance was hazy burnt yellow color with a lasting fingers worth of white foamy head that fell off at a moderate pace. Some light stringy lace.
The aroma had a majestic blend of lemon pulp sweet to bitterness, some pine, zesty to resinous behavior from the hops, sweet grass and a little bit of sweet wood.
The flavor blended everything so fully bittersweet to guide fully on into the aftertaste and finish wonderfully.
The palate was medium bodied and had a fantastic sipping quality about it. Carbonation felt spot on and the ABV felt just as projected by the brewer.
Overall, always a real treat to have some Hill Farmstead in my life.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

312,"2017-03-26",4.5,"Got in a BIF from Roguer. 750 ml swing top growler into signature tulip glass, best before 3/25/2017. Pours very hazy golden yellow color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, papaya, passion fruit, mango, melon, guava, peach, apricot, berries, white grape, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper/pine, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/tropical/citrus/earthy hops and moderate bready malt notes; with big strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, papaya, passion fruit, mango, melon, guava, peach, apricot, berries, white grape, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper/pine, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness.

Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/tropical/citrus/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with an amazing malt/bitterness balance, and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Slight dryness from lingering bitterness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready, and lightly silky/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 8%. Overall this is an insane DIPA! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/tropical/citrus/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV, thanks to the smooth/mellow bitterness. Super dank, juicy, and vibrant on hop flavors; great malt balance without feeling sweet or heavy for the ABV. An absolutely mind blowing offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
312,"2017-03-25",4.6,"On tap at Parker Pie. Ignoring past inflated ratings this is in my top 3 hoppy beers of all time, right up there with Abner and Double Citra. Pours a very very hazy bordering on murkey peach golden color with not much head. Aroma is outrageous with white grape, mango, grapefruit, soft melon, and lightly herbal. Taste is perfectly balanced malt sweetness, hop bitterness, and an explosion of floral fruitiness from the hops. I love this beer.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
312,"2017-03-03",4.0,"750mL growler filled 1/19, drunk 1/22/17.Thoroughly hazy, pale, honey-golden body is topped by a firm, white head.Dry, white wine-tinted hop notes pepper the nose, as soft passion fruit, light pineapple and red grapefruit slowly emerge to add a lighter, brighter juiciness. Orange marmalade, honey and light biscuit all sit on the finish, with tons of mineral and lots more tropical fruit juice as it warms and breathes. No alcohol or flaw.The beer begins quite dry, with obvious juicy suggestions; pineapple, passion fruit and light honey from the malts, as well as a bit of white bread and other grain. Soft, malty texture, with the typical white wine nuances from the Nelson hop and tons of coniferous character on the finish, though mostly resin free. I always get a touch of sharpness from Nelson and its present here, but the fine carbonation, soft texture and juiciness that emerges more and more with warming helps mostly ward it off. Very nice stuff, elegant as always, from Hill Farmstead. Could be a little more expressive and complex with the Nelson and I wont deny I was hoping for just a tad more juiciness, but that might just be me.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

312,"2017-01-23",3.8,"On tap at Hill Farm with Joe, pours a hazy orange with small white head. Overall notes are sticky and sugary: herbal cat piss, pine, skunk and some grape sugar. A bit boozy and sweet for me, but I will say its better than 90 percent of other 8 percent hoppy beers on the market. I absolutely love single hop nelson but this one seems heavy handed on the nelson cheese which has gotten stronger each year. The older crop seemed more sweaty and galaxy like to me. Tried again a couple days later via a growler and it was better than on site (less green/boozy) but still not my favorite. Wish Shaun would focus more on 4-7 percent hoppy stuff but this is what the kids are craving.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
