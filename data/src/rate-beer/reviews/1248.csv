1248,"2017-04-28",3.3,"Aroma is almost all bourbon and alcohol; I dont even detect the added coffee. There is a bit of caramel. No hops presence.

Color is brown with a spare offwhite head.

Taste is mildly sweet, without much bitterness.

Palate is heavily alcohol.

Overall this is just too much booze and bourbon; they dominate everything else. Its almost like drinking bourbon and branch rather than beer...nothing else comes through...","Michigan, USA","smroush"
1248,"2017-02-25",3.8,"Sampled from the tap at GTMW 2016. Pours a clear amber with a light brown head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a strong coffee note supported by whiskey and some sweet grains backing. Flavor has a combination of sweet grains and coffee with a whiskey barrel backing.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"

Rich malt prolfile. Somewhat toasty. Hot on the finish. Nice gear","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"

Taste of caramel, bread dough, toffee, vanilla, coffee, slight chocolate and whiskey on the finish. Medium carbonation, creamy mouthfeel, beautifully balanced. Great beer!","Calgary, CANADA","maley1"
1248,"2016-09-04",4.1,"Enjoyed on tap at Hopcat in Grand Rapids, MI while going to too many different breweries on a bachelor party. I didnt take tasting notes for this one, but remember this being sensational, rich in booze, coffee, raisin / molasses, light vanilla, sweet and decadent, overall a good one to try out.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"
1248,"2016-08-19",3.7,"From notes. Had this on tap at the 2016 MGB Summer Beer Fest. The pour is a lighter caramel brown, somewhat see through, with a nice thick off white head and a little lace. The aroma is full of coffee. Lots of bright roast and a decent caramel malt before the whiskey comes kicking in. And this stuff just takes names. Lots of barrel and light additions. The flavor is full of coffee and a resounding booziness to it. Its interesting. The caramel malt is there, but its just light and forgettable. The whiskey is huge. The mouth feel is thin and light with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly coffee and whiskey dominated aftertaste. Not too bad, but the base beer isnt my favorite at all.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
1248,"2016-08-17",4.1,"Pleasant sweet boozy aroma with a very light coffee w/ cream added. Dark brown with slight red tone. Taste had raisin, coffee, fermentation of yeasts, and thick molasses. Hint of barrel booze added. Abv matches taste. Nice medium mouth that covers with residual sugars for ending. Tap.","norristown, Pennsylvania, USA","katrinaez"

1248,"2016-06-04",3.8,"Snifter at Winking Lizard Westerville during the Barrel Aged Beer Mini Fest on 05/20/16 for Columbus Craft Beer Week. Pours clear dark brown with a medium beige head. Nose of malt, coffee, lager yeast and light whiskey barrel. Sweet malt and caramel flavor with coffee and vanilla accents before a light barrel finish.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
1248,"2016-05-30",3.7,"Draft to taster at the Eccentric Cafe. Looks good; a mostly transparent caramelish brown with off-white head that steadily dissipates into thin lacing. Smells of toffee, espresso, roast, and oak. Tastes like it smells, but more caramel than toffee. Mouthfeel is medium-full to full-bodied and smooth. Good beer that would probably be better without the coffee.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
1248,"2016-05-19",4.0,"Draught at Beer Trappe. Medium body with some caramel and then big whiskey and coffee. Really well done.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
1248,"2016-05-18",4.1,"Sample at Giant Eagle Market District Grandview during the ""CCBW Kickoff Party VIP Tasting"" on 05/13/2016. Dark brown color with some amber around the edges, and a medium thin light beige head that diminishes steadily to a dense film. Small patches of lacing on the glass. Aroma of roast malt, whiskey and vanilla. Full-bodied with flavors of oaky vanilla, whiskey, charred malt and coffee. The finish is oaky with a booze-infused vanilla mocha aftertaste. Good beer all around.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
