3234,"2017-06-20",4.2,"Bottle from Beerhawk. Clear vibrant light gold with fluffy white head. Heaps of gorgeous looking refreshing bubbles. With a head like that youre going to get plenty on the nose. I get scents of fresh zesty orange a light herby spice and sweet warm toffee sauce. So far so very good. Take a sip and get warm fruity oranginess and cloves fizzing in my chest. Its peppery in a Belgian way and very reminiscent of a Witbier. A light body with crisp sharp carbonation builds refreshment levels leaving a little oilyness on the lips. This is a brilliantly bright refreshing crisp beer with a softening fluffy top and a warming spice finish. Damn near as perfect an example of Belgian brewing as Ive experienced. Was like an amplified Witbier.","Aberdeen, SCOTLAND","rodsquad"

The first one, which I tried soon after buying seems a little more aggressive in the carbonisation than the 33cl bottle I tried recently, that had been in my fridge for a while. Seems to indicate a little age will help in making it softer and more elegant. Still a great beer, but I suspect the next bottles will be better. Work in progress...

(2-Sep-2016) Truly one of the best beers out there. Beautiful white, very fine foam.

A: Pours a bright, pale honey/golden color, with a small-to-moderate size, exceptionally creamy head. Head has good retention, at least as a ring.

S&T: Light and fruity, although no specific fruit comes to the fore. Clove and banana elements, but less pronounced than in some tripels. Honey too. The aroma is a bit boozy, but in a positive way ... think fine brandy or liqueur. 

M: Very smooth, with a bit of alcohol warming. Nice, light carbonation. 

Overall: One of the best tasting tripels I have ever had. Complex and flavorful, but not challenging. Very refined. Makes an excellent sipper, and I took a good long time to finish my serving, enjoying every sip.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

Første indtryk, der rammer næsen, er den krydrede aroma af koriander og tilsat belgisk gær samt hvedemalt. Senere fremkommer frugtagtige noter af banan og eksotisk frugt. 
Smagen er ganske rig, præget af alkohol og med små søde toner midt i det dominerende bitre og krydrede udtryk. Den kraftige karbonering er det næste indtryk, man overvældes af. Gær-noter og koriander er smagsindtrykkene kombineret i en middel bitterhed og lille til middel sødme. 
Mellem til solid fyldig krop og som nævnt: kraftigt karboneret, som giver skummende mundfølelse. Olieret konsistens med en bitter og lang afslutning. 
Overall: Én af de Tripel'er, der ikke er oversøde, men er vel komponeret og balanceret. En klassiker, hvis rating jeg har udsat alt for længe. Solid!

3234,"2015-07-28",4.0,"Poured from a 750ml corked bottle given to me by a coworker into a Duvel tulip. Bottle popped with a nice satisfying burst and an immediate aroma of earthy hops.

Poured a bright pale gold with a thick, fine bubbled, 2 inch, pure white head. Head dissipated into a thin foam within a couple of minutes. Nice lacing on the glass. Beer was slightly cloudy in the glass with a strong, never ending stream of bubbles eminating from the bottom, center of the glass. Very nice. As soon as the bottle was opened, there was a strong, earthy hop aroma. After pouring into the glass this was amplified even more. Although a very appealing aroma, it is rather one dimensional. I dont detect much of anything else. No malt, and only the slightest of Belgian funk. Nice, but not as complex as I was hoping for. Taste follows the aroma. Dominated with hop bitterness, but some malt sweetness, some fruitiness and a touch of funk comes through. At 8.4%, the alcohol is hidden very well. This is a very drinkable beer. I tend to think of this as a Belgian IPA. Hops forward with some character to back it up. Mouthfeel is solid. Rich and full with lots of prickly carbonation felt on the center and back of the tongue. Very nice. To me, this is a highly drinkable Belgian tripel. Usually, I have a difficult time with this style, but this beer - I could have a couple with no problem. The alcohol is hidden well and the flavors balance nicely with nothing overpowering.

Medium head. Nice wheaty with full bodied yeasty nose in the wonderful chalice it is served in.

Beautiful mouthfeel. Light and full of lively carbonation with a good stout beery heft worthy of a tripel. The carbonation hides the alcoholic punch of the tripel. Beautiful yellow fading towards amber. Just beautiful. I cant stop using that word when describing this tripel. Very nice! I think Im in love! Rare to find a tripel that has the carbonation of a pilsner and the heft of a tripel. Tripels as a general rule are mostly syrupy, constantly reminding you of you of their gravitas. But this is just lovely. All the way to the end when your stomach reminds you that you just had a tripel. Nothing else about the experience other than the heavenly buzz that starts to warmly wrap its tentacles around your pontine cortex and brainstem is characteristic of a tripel.

One of the greats in my book. A definite must have after a long day....

The dudes at Brouwerij Bosteels in Buggenhout. Belgium have stumbled on gold if its true that theyve kept to the recipe from the Carmelites from 1679 in the convent in Dendermonde. Three grains are used, oats, wheat and barley. Pure genius results.

3234,"2015-03-25",4.7,"Bottle conditioned. First brewed 1996; claimed to be based on a recipe from 1679 which used wheat, oat and barley. Tripel Karmeliet is a very refined and complex golden-to-bronze brew with a fantastic creamy head. These characteristics derive not only from the grains used but also from restrained hopping with Styrians and the fruity nature (banana and vanilla) of the house yeast. Aroma has hints of vanilla mixed with citrus aromas. Tripel Karmeliet has not only the lightness and freshness of wheat, but also the creaminess of oats together with a spicy lemony almost quinine dryness.

3234,"2014-12-20",3.7,"I might just be adding to the noise, but heres my take on this. 
This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a hazy golden yellow to orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute leaving some light lacing arranging itself nicely around the glass. 
The smell had a nice blend of sweet iced apple with a light citrus bitterness and then a light clove to even things out a bit. 
The taste was mainly sweet but carried a nice crisp spice to it through the clove. Theres a slight sticky sweet aftertaste and finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat sharp but not overbearing. I say this was good.

3234,"2014-10-24",3.9,"Three-grains tripel launched by Bosteels in 1996, when I accidentally stumbled upon it in an otherwise not too beer-oriented pub. Allegedly after a recipe from the 17th century carmelite convent of Buggenhout, but we all know strong blonde beers didnt exist yet back then, so do not buy this bogus story. Do buy the beer though, as it has become a true classic of the style. I tasted it dozens of times from a regular 33 cl bottle, from tap and also from an aged 75 cl bottle, which this rating is mainly centered around. Poured in its own majestic and royal yet elegant glassware, it builds a near Duvel-thick, yellowish white, very creamy and remarkably stable head; colour is a warm orangey blonde, almost clear but hazy with deposit, as expected from the style. Appealing aroma of orange, melon, peach, red apple, soap, wheat, ginger, dough, coriander, white pepper, mint, grassy hops, vanilla, lavender, honey, cake. The aged 75 cl version also displays, above all these goodies, a strong, sulphuric, earthy, hay-, sherry- and saison-like wildness. Taste is a soft sweetish maltiness, vivid fruitiness, orange, peach, honey, relatively strong carbo, light but elegant and refreshing sourish wheat, very velvety and gentle mouthfeel (probably the oats doing their work), a bit rooty, well-rounded, fluffy and full, with the honey factor staying with you all the time; finishes in a nice herbal hop bitterishness with some warming alcohol, just the way you want your tripel to end. If Westmalle Tripel is to be considered ""the mother of tripels"", this one is at least a proud aunt, which should be respected and revered for adding to the style, expanding its boundaries, without disrespecting it. This is a truly lovely beer, although it comes in different shapes and forms (which should not all be trusted to the same extent - but out of respect for the brewery, I will say no more); one of the big Belgian classics. Youll be surprised by its drinkability, for which it deserves extra points: you can drink this all night, only to find out afterwards the considerable amount of alcohol you indulged yourself into, without having noticed it. Kudos to Tripel Karmeliet.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
3234,"2014-10-23",4.3,"The appearance of this beer is an opaque golden with a large white head that fades somewhat quickly. The aroma blends Belgian yeast, particularly fruity esters, and light malts, and the taste is a very smooth blend of a slight sourness and a mild sweetness with a touch of umami from the yeast presence in this beer. The aftertaste is much lighter than the initial flavor, but the Belgian yeast definitely lingers for a long time on the tongue. The palate fuses medium-light body, a nearly thick texture, and an average carbonation that bites at the tongue as the beer stays in your mouth.","Columbia, Missouri, USA","EtTuCthulhu"

 Pours from bottle into a chalice glass

 Appearance  Upon pouring, the brew was a golden yellow color with a one finger pure white head and lots of carbonation seen streaming through the brew. The head fades relatively quickly, leaving a lighter level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma was of a grainy and lightly biscuit nature with some hints of yeast and orange peel. There are aromas of some candied sugar as well a little bit of spice and an herbal/haylike smell mixed within.

 Taste- The taste begins with a nice Belgian malt flavor and flavors of biscuit. Even though it is moderately dry upfront there are some hints of some orange sweetness with other sweeter candied sugar tastes. The orange dwindles more toward the middle as a lemon citrus taste takes it place. Yeast flavors come to the tongue at this time and bring with them some floral hop as well as some spice of clove and coriander. These flavors take the taste to its end, where the candied sugar then largely leaves the taste, with a bit of a herbal taste taking its place, to leave a clean and crisp malty and dry fruit flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is on the thinner side with a carbonation level that is high with tons of tiny champagne like bubbles. The thinner body and higher carbonation are fantastic for the drier and fruity flavors of the brew and make for a truly fanatic feel and great drinkability.

 Overall  Quite easy drinking and enjoyable. This is a very nice triple and renowned for a good reason.","","Darkmagus82"

Big cereal malt character to the aroma, sprinkled with notes of coriander, banana, citrus and some cheesy yeast. Taste takes on a very cereal-y character as well, strongly reminiscent of creamy porridge or rice pudding, behind which are notes of honey, caramel, vanilla, what might be some spices and a tiny yet noticeable citrus edge. Definitely not overly sweet despite the lack of a bitter aftertaste. Palate is pretty exceptional; very full body combining with the oily texture and creamy taste makes for a delightful mouth feel, with just a little bit of carbonation adding some addition texture.

3234,"2014-07-13",4.4,"Tripel Karmeliet pours golden with a haze from the yeasts, the white head is of medium-long lifetime and leaves beautiful lacing behind. The nose is massive, with notes of white pepper, citrus zests, strong milk tea, and muted yet recognizable note of vanilla interfering. The nose is phenomenal. The flavor starts off by displaying a generous amount of fruitiness and vinous characteristics, followed by caramel, creaminess, and aromatics of Earl Grey tea - as well as its astringency - on the mid-palate, whereupon the finish opens with spicy pepper and makes the transition into muscat, warming alcohol, and gentle hop bitterness. While complex, the flavor transition and mouthfeel are incredibly smooth and display all the subtleties one can reasonably ask for. What a delightful brew.","Berlin, GERMANY","Schnabelhund"

Banana seems to be traceable as well. It is mild on the palate with a well balanced sweetness that remains fresh and lightweight - because of the wheat and oats, I assume - with only a faint hint of bitterness at the end of its lasting finish.

O: Less bitter than other tripels, but that could be put down to my changing palate which is growing accustomed to the style.","Greater London, ENGLAND","Jonb5"

Strong sweet kick to begin with, followed by a boozy kick (lingers a little bit in the back of the mouth), then the taste of sweet oats slowly sets in followed by a touch of sourness. Aftertaste is slightly creamy.

As soon as I approach the glass I smell that particular wheat/banana aroma, followed by a typical bread sweet maltiness. Citrus and hops are a bit present too, giving it a very complex aroma. Taste is even more articulated: its sweet, and you can taste so much that wheaty, almost blanche (belgian wit) flavour, followed by a strong citrus, fruit and yeast mid range notes, and a perfectly light bitter finish. Average carbonation, with an almost champagne feel and end notes; very refreshing, fruity and sophisticated finish.

Theres a light, mellow, astringent quality too. After a little while, the classic banana and clove combination spring forth and dominate the aroma, but there are some undertones of vanilla, peach and lemon with a bit of grass and seltzer water. This one starts out a clear, sparkling yellow with a light, soft, pillowy, sudsy (active) head that leaves a light lacing along the glass. As I neared the end of the bottle, and the un-fermented sediment, the beer became more hazy. Its hits the tongue with a mild sweetness, medium bitter, and light sour with some mild astringency. Its a very creamy and smooth beer with a medium to medium-full body (more medium at the start, gets fuller with more un-fermented proteins). Its a very fizzy, above average carbonation that starts with a combination of sweet citrus and dark dried fruits as well as some light caramel and/or butter notes and some spice. It becomes a bit toasty and dry at the finish, where the astringency pops up, and is accompanied by a light alcohol warmth at the swallow.

Nice head, lasts quite some time if well poured ,which I do not always manage :-( ... 

Nose malty and yeast, some discreet gras / flower. First sip reveals a strong taste where in my opinion malt and yeast a perfetly balanced. Quite often I find the yeast too strong in triples, but here it is just perfect.

Jasne, mętne słomkowo-cytrynowe. Piana biała, bardzo obfita, musująca, aż trudno nalać tak duża ilość się wytwarza, ale jeszcze szybciej znika całkowicie.

W smaku ciekawe połączenie słodyczy, kwaskowatych posmaków, nut estrowych owocowych, bananów, przypraw i alkoholu. Na finiszu zaznaczona chmielowo-alkoholowa goryczka.

A: pours hazy golden with three fingers of persistent white foam. This slowly, okay, not much, falls at all. Pretty much maintains 1-2 fingers foam throughout the life. Beautiful.
S: Initially I get plenty of floral notes followed up by some nice sweet grains and yeast characters. I think this smells really, really nice for a tripel.
T: Subtly sweet with floral notes and again very tasteful yeast and coriander characteristics. Really a top notch beer.
M: Medium bodied with appropriately hi carbonation. Mouth-watering finish.
O: I think this might be the best Tripel Ive had. Really a great beer. Now if only they would switch to dark glass.

Every time I try and get someone into Belgians - I always start here. Typically I'm not even a big tripel fan, but this is amazing. 

Pours golden with a giant fluffy head that soon dissipates and settles nicely. Beautiful lacing too!
Smells of candi sugar, banana, spice and lemon peel. A pleasantly mild alcohol aroma too. (Though no-one would believe you it's 8.4%!)
Highly complex taste!! Sweet lemon, bitter lime, spice, wheat, banana, oranges, pineapple ...I could go on. Small touch of alcohol bite too. Pleasant. 
Light, wheaty texture. Not too syrupy like some tripels. Unusually it is also incredibly well-balanced.

The beer did not really cloud up when I swished & poured in the bottom contents. Aroma is of sweet, bready, grains, candied fruit, banana, sourness, a hop zing, and banana peel. Flavor is of banana, coriander, bread, sweetness, candied fruit, banana puree, some hop bitterness, and a background grain husk that one gets with a high-gravity malt liquor, such as St. Ides HG. I also noticed a metallic note in the foam, which was oddly reminiscent of Red Dog from a can. Mouthfeel is medium and prickly, and Tripel Karmeliet finishes mostly dry, crisp, champagne-like, and easy going.

But as much as I tried, I couldnt; this is a rather delicious, and rather unique tripel. Looks great, with a slightly dark gold colour. The aroma isnt huge, but quite fresh with its dominant spicy citrus. Almost, strangely, with a nose somewhat like a white wine. The taste comes at you with some big, candy banana, peppery spiciness and ripe pear. Its a bit lighter than expected. Reminiscent of a blonde. That said, quite sweet and creamy, with that yeasty undertone, but without the heaviness of other tripels. Also due to its boisterous carbonation. The spice and slight bitterness come through at the finish to clean the palate almost completely - and leaves me wanting to go back for more! Very pleasantly surprised.","AUSTRALIA","Timothy_Ryan"

3234,"2013-02-07",3.6,"Pours a golden hazy body with a large, white head that initially looks rather creamy, but then the tiny bubbles start to merge and creates a big-bubbled very long-lived bath foam that clings well to the glass. The aroma is strong and has a more obvious malty profile than many other beers of this style. It still has plenty of yeast, spices and fruit, but the sweet caramel malty stuff makes the aroma even more complex than the average tripel. There are also some pleasant vanilla notes and some citric hints. The taste is light sweet, light acidic and it has a long-lasting moderate bitter with a bit too much alcohol. The alcohol is rather stingy, aggressive and solvent-like. Still, the flavours are pleasant and quite strong, with fruits, banana, spices, yeast, citrus, vanilla and again this extra layer of malty sweetness. Dry, smooth and pleasant mouthfeel with a lively carbonation and medium body. A very nice ale, but I expected more from the Best Tripel In The World, or maybe I just wasnt in the triple mood this evening? I guess I should try it again soon.

3234,"2013-02-05",3.7,"Rating #803, smagt med Adam og Brianwillum. Endelig lykkedes det mig at få smagt på denne øl. Det har ikke været svært at få fat i den som sådan, men af en eller anden grund er det altid lykkedes mig at gå uden om den blandt mine ølindkøb selvom jeg ved, hvor højt et gennemsnit den har her på Ratebeer. Forrige gang jeg bestemte mig for at nu skulle det være, var den udsolgt, og sidste gang gik den til en veninde der er glad for lyse, belgiske øl. Nu lykkedes det endelig. Det er som forventet en typisk tripel hvad udseende angår, nemlig i form af sin uklare gule kulør, men måske en anelse mindre skumdannelse end normalt, hvilket dog nok er påvirket af, at øllen startede med at skumme vildt og voldsomt over og skyde kapslen ind i min overlæbe, da jeg åbnede den. Det har derfor været lidt svært for mig, at bedømme netop dette punkt. Duften er skarp af mandarin, citrus og lavendel - derudover generelt sød. Smagen er fuld af lavendel, citrus, sødme og en god bitterhed der spiller godt sammen med sødmen og humlen. Starter måske en smule ensformigt ud, men smagen vokser med tiden i munden. Tyngden er gennemsnitlig, men cremet og god. I alt et rigtig godt bryg som dog ikke er så imponerende som forventet. Jeg vil eventuelt prøve den igen uden en eksplosiv åbningsceremoni.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"

Had a 330ml bottle at Brabant.  Poured a beautiful hazy orange with a huge, full white head. Aroma is lots of yeast and fruity oranges. Taste is full on Belgian yeast, spice, fruits and caramel.

Fairly smooth and quite creamy to mouth; Alcoholic character is present but well hidden; Hop presence comes with a mild and brief spike as a finish. The 8.4% abv work up very gradually and is very enjoyable, standard to any good Tripel, with no bad knocks or sudden attack throughout. Slightly dry after taste.

Comments: it has the look and some of the taste of Leffe Blonde, yet its stronger in abv, a well-managed alcoholic character at the expense of smell and taste - yes, its rather monotonous compare to the highly aromatic Leffe BIonde and the tasty Chimay White and Leffe Brune - yet its oat-boosted smoothness make up a lot of ground in palate. Its a winner without a doubt, a close second to Chimay White, if only the taste can be further improved.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

La longueur est de la haute couture dune délicatesse extrême.
La levure est douce, intégrale et parfaitement adaptée à son sujet.
La finale témoigne de la complexité au plus haut point.
Cette bière est un sommet de lart brassicole. 
Si lon doit chiffrer cet art pur, cest comme la cote dun grand peintre, il suffit de 
quelques amateurs pour faire monter le chiffre, je dirais 5 doffice, et comme cest 
une triple dans le nom et dans les céréales, nous avons 555 sur 100.

3234,"2012-08-05",4.1,"A: The beer appears a light yellow hue, with a towering ivory head that elegantly embraces the upper half of the tulip glass, leaving a fine sheet of lacing as it recedes. The liquid is clear and effervescent, teeming with bubbles.

S: The aroma is grand, with scents of lemons, oranges, grass, alcohol, and spices. Tripel Karmeliet emits a fabulous floral aroma that adds to an already full bouquet. The beer smells very bold and enticing.

T: A fine brew and a great example of a Belgian tripel. The flavor is strong, forward, and aggressive, yet balanced by a delicate sweetness that creates a delightful juxtaposition. Citrus flavors are quite prominent, followed by spiced apples soaked in alcohol.

M: Alcohol presence is there. The feel is medium in body, with a healthy dose of zesty carbonation.

D: This is a beer to sniff, sip, and savor. One in any given session is plenty for me.

3234,"2012-05-09",3.5,"Brown 33cl bottle, best before Jan 2009, drank June 2007. 

Poured into my magnificent Judas glass (its huge). I love the proper glass and must get one.

The body is an old gold colour with loads of carbonisation ripping through to replenish the large foaming head. The head began to shrink about half way though the drink, which was a shame because it looked fantastic at the start of the session. 

The aroma was of yeast, sour apples and mixed spices, as the beer warmed, they intensified. 

The alcohol is there foremost in the taste, but not overpowering enough to put you off, the other flavours of hops, yeast and apple-pie spices see to that. 

Spices and a little citrus taste arrives in the mouthfeel, very pleasant.

I dont know why, but the first time I smelled this beer the first thing that came to my mind is ""wow, thats a classic"".  Color is a clear, albeit a bit darkish golden.  It produced a huge white head when poured and persisted until the end.  It was looking a bit strange in that tulip of mine, again I wouldve preferred a Trappist glass. Taste is really balanced and perhaps its what makes this beer the best trippel I ever had.  Slight bitterness.  Body is medium-light with a thin texture, carbonation is a bit above average.

3234,"2012-02-19",4.2,"/From notes.  First reviewed 12/19/2008.

Lets go to Dendermonde.
Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a snifter.

The appearance is a perfect, slightly opaque golden ale with a huge head, which recedes nicely to leave patches of white lacing. Perpetual internal carbonation. Wow. If allowed to let settle and poured carefully, some small yeast particles will be visible and it will be less opaque. 

The aroma is very subtle. A delicate blend of crisp apples, honey, apricot, some lightly roasted malt, and some bready notes.

First I am hit with some crisp, lightly toasted malt, which moves into a light honey taste. After half a second I sense the crisp apples I smelled before. This is slightly syrupy, which is probably the only reason I have to take off half a point. A slight alcohol presence is warming and pleasant towards the end of the sip, although not too powerful, even though it is 8.00% ABV. The hops are very understated, barely scratching the palate but trying to gently balance out the malt. The yeast adds a light biscuity flavor throughout. This yeast provides a nice third leg for this beer.

A high amount of carbonation in this ale, combined with the light apple taste make it very crisp in my mouth. 

This tripel is crisp, light, and smooth. There is not much more you could ask for than an easy-drinking tripel.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3234,"2011-11-25",4.2,"750ml bottle, shared with my family before Thanksgiving dinner. I wanted to expand their craft beer palates, and I asked the guy working at Dutchs for a good Belgian. He said everyone he knows thats sampled this beer has enjoyed it. I was not disappointed. Pale, only mildly hazy yellow color (the last pour was much more hazy). HUGE foamy head, takes up the majority of the tall, skinny glasses we served this in.. Splotches of lace, naturally. Almost no carbonation at all, very smooth and creamy texture. Wheat backbone, but wonderfully fruity and estery. Spicy, but not overspiced... The whole thing is very balanced, everything about it. Sort of a sweet taste, maybe some savory balanced with the perfect amount of spice... its a complex taste, with a soft, round zest. Really nice and interesting.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

Citrus steps forward while the end of glass is approaching. Lovely tripel, not too sweet and hides alcohol very vell. Paired fine with belgian fries + dijon mayonnaise.

Yeast and pale malt dominant in the taste; sweet with a slight bitterness at the finish. Medium bodied, a touch dry, and a touch fizzy. Good beer, but the the Heineken-like aspect of the aroma doesnt make me crazy. At least there isnt any of that in the taste.

Pours clear, paler cheap cider golden, bubbles rising & white head fizzes away very quickly. Nose is cheap lemon lemonade, air refresher, bit DE profile, white sugar, sweet cornflakes, hint esters. Taste is cornflakes, white sugar sweet, sweet lemonade (lemon), almost hint radler, light esters, cleaning products, zest, citrus, sweet, yeast which seems more DE than BE for me. Carb. is very high. Wow, this was quite a disappointment for me & quite different from what I remember it being. So much so that I almost feel certain that this is not the beer which I had 5 or so years ago. Feels to compromised, cheapened to make as much as possible. Went from 4.7 to 4.5 at some point. Going to give it 4.1 for a mix of both ratings, I feel like giving this 3.5 A downer.

A spicy sweet and partly hoppy aroma. Liquid is hoppy, with some honey sweetness and a delicate smoky touch which I love. Touches of cheese.

Belgian sugars dominate palate entry, but quickly reveal fruity mix of cantaloupe, citrus and banana, and the expected clove spiciness of the style.

Fully enjoying this, one of the nicer ones Ive had in awhile.","Denver, Colorado, USA","tennessejed420"

I havent had this one before and havent been drinking Belgian ales lately but decided to treat myself. Brilliantly clear, golden yellow in color and great head formation, retention, and lacing. Bananas, orange peel, and coriander on the nose and much the same on the palate. Not really complex in these aspects. What you see (smell, taste) is what you get which isnt exactly a bad thing but I thought if there was anything lacking it was in these areas. Just medium bodied but still almost syrupy in texture.

3234,"2010-05-09",4.1,"Why-oh-why must she come to me in a green corked 750ml bottle?!


There is a fine dusting of yeast at the bottom of her green champagne bottle depths. Bottle-conditioned? I would say so. According to her wire cage, she is good until December 2010, more than enough time to mature a bit in her glassy confines. Of course, Im all for trying a beer fresh also which is exactly what I did not too long ago. Clear golden grains freshly harvested from the fields gather neatly in my glass below fluffy white clouds. A brilliant stream of bubbles burst their way through to the surface, pushing the clouds aside and releasing a delicious nose. Sweet and rich, ripe tangerines release tantalizing esters as I peel their skins aside, sticky juices tracing their way down my wrist and arm. Orange and apricot marmalade is slathered generously atop freshly toasted hunks of white bread. Honey straight from the comb joins her juicy marmalade friends for a purely selfish indulgence of toasted bliss. Lemon skin and pith plays in the background while lavender and sunflower esters drift along a warm spring breeze. Tripel Karmeliet exudes spring, when Mother Nature starts to breathe life and glory into her winter-weary children. White pepper and grains of paradise spice up the picture, but more in the background then the foreground, complimenting the lemon zest already there. I dont know about you, but Im thirsty so without further ado Smooth with a mildly effervescent mouthfeel. Fresh honey and homemade orange and apricot marmalade kiss my lips with delightfully sticky nectar while whole loaves of soft white breads are removed from time-worn brick ovens. Soft oats abound, a testament to one of the three prized grains used in the brewing of this particular Tripel. Crunchy white water crackers offer a pleasant contrast while only a gentle kiss of dryness lingers after each quaff. Floral and honey esters tinge my breath even as lemon, white pepper, and grains of paradise refresh my weary body. A bottled spring day spent lazing about golden fields of grain while a flower bed sways lazily in a gentle spring breeze. Take that long moment of Zen, bottle it, and call it Tripel Karmeliet.


I really wish she didnt come in a green glass bottle, but whats a gal to do. Thankfully, my brew suffered none of the potentially skunked fates that can await a beer bottled in anything other than brown glass. I understand now why Tripel Karmeliet enjoys a cultish status of sinfully delicious quaffability. Much like Duvel, so easy to drink made all that more dangerous by her generous ABV.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"
3234,"2010-05-08",3.6,"750 ml. bottle from Macs on West Peachtree. Light orange and dark yellow appearance. Translucent brew with a foamy head that seems to be fading away rather quickly. Bubblegum, yeast, sugar, light banana, clove, and a touch of grass provide a very nice nuanced aroma. Light spicy aroma as well. Wow, Im very impressed with this aroma; U.S. versions of the tripel seem as though theyre starting to become more artificial-smelling and tasting. This beer is too carbonated. Mother fucker, I am sick and tired of tripels drinking like soda-water for Gods sake. Spicy notes are hitting the taste buds. Im also betting that yeast, sugar, and bubblegum. The clove and banana arent really coming through as they were in the aroma. The flavor is relatively nice, but I cant understand how or why someone would come to the conclusion that this much carbonation is necessary for a beer. The carbonation is caustic and just biting the hell out of my tongue and mouth. There are some nice flavors here, but the carbonation just kills a lot of what could be considered a stellar tripel.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

S- Sweet, Spicy, and Bready. Lots of spicy yeast with a dry, fruity balance of pears, apples, and citrus.

T- Citrus, pears, and apples upfront with a bready/spicy yeast background. A slight sweetness emerges with the initial taste. The finish adds a touch of hop flavor to compliment the dry fruitiness. What lingers is a big spicy and sweet bready yeast taste along with a hint of alcohol bitterness.

P- Light carbonation and light body. Very smooth and creamy from the yeast.

O- This is a wonderful Tripel. At 8% ABV it has a slightly lower alcohol content then most. ABV is also very well hidden here which makes it all the more drinkable. Aside from that this brew is light, crisp, complex, and very tasty. Something that I will definitely pick up again

A - Creamy and hazy gold with a large white cream colored head. Decent amount of lacing left over.

T - Similar to the smell. Fairly sweet with lots of fruit and a decent amount of honey. Fair amount of malt. This is contrasted with the spices and a bit of alcohol heat coming through. This prevents it from being too sweet.

M - Medium body with a decent amount of carbonation. Quite creamy. Fairly warming too.

Quite a robust taste. Loads of fruitiness from the yeast; apple, pear, and lemon notes. Sweet, yet slightly acidic. Some champagne-like hints. Some solid hop presence, which lingers into the after-taste. Some dryness in the finish, together with some wheaty breadiness.

Medium body to it. Loads of carbonation at first, quite crisp overall. There is some booziness to it, and I was able to feel it quite a bit.

3234,"2009-12-29",3.6,"Bottled. The 3rd to last beer in my (rather simple) quest to rate all the top 50 most rated beers. This was one I passed up for far too long, merely because it was so readily available but slightly pricey. However, a $4 Belgian that was way too expensive a few years ago is now not a bad deal at all.

This pours initially a very clear gold with a nice, large bubbled head that fades pretty fast. An addition of the yeast (which was deemed critical after my first smell and sip) made it quite cloudy and nice, with some lacing that lasts in the glass and minor, actively rising carbonation.

The aroma is at first fruity and sweet, highlighting strawberry and pomegranate, and transitions to a more herbal, woodsy profile as the beer breathes and warms. While mostly licorice and alcohol when still, agitation provides a welcome complexity. However, the nose is a bit too sweet to me and lacking in a forward, doughy yeast that I always hope for in the best tripels. 

The flavor is calm and inviting, displaying a mild sweatiness through with notes of egg, thyme, and mild tropical fruits. The carbonation is quite low and rather soft; I could do with a bit more here. There is a short, sweet finish, which leaves a bit of sugar on the lips, but there is a lack of complexity that I find disappointing. 

In the end, I must say this one was a disappointment. Tripels to me are a theoretically fantastic style, yet I can find so few examples that truly impress me. With the very high rating on this one I expected an undiscovered (to me) gem that Id been passing up for way too long, but instead was let down by a fairly straight-forward, too sweet (marginally) beer that differs little from most else out there. Guess Ill have to keep looking.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

I had a somewhat difficult time picking up the scent...I dont know if it was where I was, or if my nose wasnt working.  The taste was fantastic though.  It was hard to pick out an individual flavor, but it was a nice fruity blend that seemed to have a slightly peachy taste.  In addition, I could sense a nice sugar lingering in the background.

3234,"2009-11-20",3.0,"25.4 ounce bottle purchased at Nugget Market in Woodland, CA.  On sale for $9.99.  Green bottle.  Opens with that uncanny smell of DMS and skunked hops from the fucking green bottle.  This dissipates to a degree, leaving a bet of an ester aroma.  There is a fair amount of peppery spiciness present in the nose of this thing, too.  All in all, not an overly striking aroma.  Transparent golden body with a fizzy white head that leaves decent lacing.  Bright carbonation to start, which becomes a little sweet with some honey notes towards the middle.  Banana yeast flavors then come through.  Rounds out with a bit of a spicy, herbal finish with some lasting skunky hops and some metallic hop flavors.  The green bottle really detracts from this beer.  Ill have to go to the Trappist sometime and have this and re-rate it from the tap.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

Appearance: The body has a golden color with a cloudy haze. Inside there are little bits of tasty yeast floaters. The head on top is tall, long lasting and bright whit in color. As I drink it leaves some spotty lacing on the glass.

Smell: Right from the pop of the cap the aroma creeps out of the bottle. It has a bright nose with hints of lemon zest, fruity and funky Belgian yeast.

Taste/Mouth: The flavor has sweetness up front with complex grainy malt flavor and a hint of clover honey. The middle sees fruity and funky yeast and mellow warming alcohol taking over and drying out the overall character. It then finishes bone dry with only a hint of herbal hops. The palate is medium bodied with good carbonation.

Im getting an endless supply of bubbles out of my Karmeliet goblet that only helps feed the colossal off white crown that was produced on the pour. The lacing is average but this is kind of misleading as half my glass has been filled with beer foam...even a light swirl starts the bubble factory up. The aroma is of sweet orange, nice floral hops (my brain tells me it has noticed the faint aroma of roses), a low ammount of spice from the yeat and some alcohol heat that slightly burns the nostrils. The taste is caramelly, orange, lightly spiced yeast with the alcohol not quite hidden in the background. It did come across more mild that I expected.

As it calms down, theres some herbal/grassy and some hay-like notes in there, but the fruit from the yeast dominates. In the mouth, it is round and full at first, with the ripe fruit from the aroma, almost like a sweet white wine; then, you feel the carbonation, and perhaps a bit of leafy hop astringency. The bitterness is assertive, definitely enough to dry out the flavour. It strikes a nice balance between sweet and bitter, fruit and spice, roundness and effervescence, what have you.

Beer had a beautiful golden brown color and gave up hints of wheat and barley. Upon tasting, the most noticeable characteristic is the sweetness, which is quite strong for a tripel, but pleasant nonetheless. The beer tastes of light honey, minor nut, and some vanilla.

update bottled version 7/28/09: aroma is very yeasty, with balanced sweetness (vanilla, light-colored fruit), some floral fragrance, mixed grain (oats?) and a touch of hops (grassy, herbal primarily).

3234,"2008-10-12",4.2,"Pours gold with a 3 finger off white head that fades to .5 finger then sustains with carbonate from the beer. 
Aroma is belgian yeastiness with banana, bubble gum, and that tangy fresh sourdough bread note. Also in the nose is a notable coriander and nutmeg spice, plenty of citrus, soap, and malts are not absent with a wheat sweet bread note that is quite inviting. 

Flavor is spicy at first, coriander, black pepper, cloves. Then the fruitiness rolls  in sweet orange glaze, lemon zest, raisins, candy spiced plums. The yeast is notable coming in with the fruits with a bready banana, nutty, clove bite. 

FInish is spicy, with some honey, oat and wheat sweetness that comes to a very clean and crisp end for a Tripel.

Palate is thick but not so much so for a tripel. Oily, then astringent on the palate, then sticky on the lips.

Overall a pretty decent tripel. It may trade a little heft and complexity for ease of drinkability but is really very enjoyable despite that fact.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

Flavour is full of citrus and clove, with a sprinkling of corriander, spice, and a sweet malt flavour. Spice lingers with the sweetness. No alcohol detected at all, this drinks so easily and at 8% youre feeling quite nice at the end of the glass. This is the closest thing to the original Westmalle Tripel Ive found yet. A simply first-rate beer. When tasted next to a Westmalle Tripel the flavours are much more pronounced with a far longer aftertaste in the Westmalle.

3234,"2008-07-17",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2008 Heres a beer of many flavors.  This deep gold brew, with traces of pomegranate edges, speaks softly and carries a big punch.  A thin soft head, butter, mandarin orange, wheat, peach, apricot, all-spice and graham cracker for a nose, this thing is everything but pungent at first.  But the Tripel Karmeliet is a highly, highly carbonated brew.  So much so that I have to wait for its temper to settle.  Once I do, I get a heavy graininess with pinches of clove again and a bit of the orange dryness.  A bit too furious for me.

August 18th Update - The Tripel Karmeliet is a lesson in perfect balance and harmony.  I don’t always comment on the balance of a beer, and when I do it’s usually in regard to an unfortunate imbalance.  But the Triple Karmeliet is remarkable in that every sip was a proclamation to the art of hitting the sweet spot in a beer - the Tiger Woods shot in golf that sings.  This beer sings, and sings beautifully.  A thin, tan head swells from the beer, leaving behind trails of spaced lacing as it urgently recedes back into the glass.  The richly orange and muddy beer underneath is a willing receptor for the retreating foam, giving off a wonderful perfume in exchange.  The sweet and estery aromas that give the trippel style its signature scent reach the nose first, with a well-hopped body and a well weighted floral component and banana touch sanding this beer’s jagged edges into a perfectly smooth curve of balance.  The oat taste and ester-sweet aromatics draw me quickly to the glass.  The flavor seems watery, but paradoxically, not weak.  The balance of sweet and dry really shines.  In my notes I write, ""Good, great, GREAT balance!"" as the paramounce of what’s been accomplished in this beer take on its full weight.  A white wine taste covers both ends of the spectrum, with the grains pairing against a deep honey sweetness.  It’s not an intricate flavor, but it’s good, and again, balanced within microns of perfection.  The Triple Karmeliet would put the Hubble telescope’s manufacture to shame.  As the Triple Karmeliet warms, the alcohol becomes more prominent, bringing with it ever greater tastes if grain.  A testament to proper yin and yang.

Theres definitely something sweet and tropical in the background that I couldnt quite pin down - maybe mango? Some pepper in there too, but the over-riding feeling is freshness, like an easily quaffable golden ale for the summer (a dangerous taste indeed given the strength!).

A great blend of fruity sweetness like apple, papaya and mango counter the bold spiciness highlighted by the flavors of lemon zest and white pepper balancing it nicely. Zippy hops pop in the finish with a surge of alcohol for good measure. The feel was medium/full bodied with a nice velvety texture.

Then a short hoppiness tempered by a strong dose of vanilla following with a huge caramel note that seems to linger forever. Fantastic and remarkably balanced.

The base brew, while strong and solid in the mouth, objectively well constructed, lacked any real character for me. Instead, unearthly amounts of spices were added to give it some flavor.

The nose is of peaches, cinnamon, mint, cloves, coriander and rosemary with a nice peppery background. Some strawberries and apples showing up too. Quite a lot of coriander, rosemary and strawberries in the taste. Full bodied. Peppery with peaches, cloves and cinnamon appearing. Slightly acidic, but in a good way. Extremely well balanced and remarkably spicy, peppery (mentioning it again deliberately), with hints of lemon and oranges. The mouthfeel is very enjoyable. Rather malty with some lovely flowery hops. A tremendously complex brew. Some berries and lime sneaking in after after a few sips. The finish is extraordinary. Peppery, yeasty, woody with an outstanding lingering fruity touch accompanied by reminiscent licorice. The quintessential tripel.

Like in the noose, there are reminiscences of honey, vanilla, cookies and butter. Fruitiness like blond raisins, orange in syrup, papayas and banana. Warming and some mentholated final. Wheaty aftertaste.
Palate: medium body and an exquisite soft, creamy and semi-oily texture (maybe for the barley and wheat not malted and the oats.). Medium carbonated.
Complex, balanced and an exquisite texture. Tripel in the three dimensions, it this: dry, three grains and high alcoholic degree.","Santiago, CHILE","davidpl"

Flavor is strong, intense, sweet with fruity touches of oranges, tangerines, tequila margarita, spices (coriander, pepper & cardamom) and grains... you can feel the wheat & oats. The finish is so huge, spicy and sweet citrusy.
Body is medium, ultra-smooth texture (thanks to the Oats), creamy. High carbonation.... maybe the only letdown of this beauty. The finish explodes with a strong alcoholic touch.

Caramel sweetness slowly creeps in the finish along with a nice mixture of a pears light citrus. This is really good. This tasting has proven to be difficult to rate next to each other.

3234,"2007-11-12",4.4,"A fantastic example of the Tripel style. Im intrigued by the 17th-century recipe making use of oats, barley and wheat. 
It pours a beautiful golden color thats fun to look at, and is *quite* bubbly besides. The nose is incredibly rich: apricot, wheat, snow peas, coriander, Chinese 5-spice powder, and a wee bit of banana. 
The taste brings on a touch of toasted sesame, and the spicy bubbliness keeps on coming. 
Not an every-day beer, definitely a special-occasion, rich, rich beer. Thick, even. It would go well with Vietnamese cuisine (think light, but spicy, noodle-bowls with peanut sauce), but it loves it some balsamic peaches, and also is very happy with romano, ricotta, and a good whitefish like skate.

Visuellement parlant, cette bière est splendide : elle est dun jaune/orange qui convoite le rubis. Il mest également difficile de ne pas être hypnotisé par lapparence de cette uvre brassicole qui me rappelle  ais-je la berlue ?  les plus belles tartes au citron de ma jeunesse (minus la meringue, et la pâte).

The aroma is lovely fruity, with citrus and some banana, pale malt, cloves and other spices. It is a bit gazzy in the mouth, but it is a full-bodied beer with a good deal of sweetness. The flavor is just lovely, sweet and fruity, with a nice hoppy bitterness in the back of your mouth, as well as coriander and alcohol. Despite all the sweetness, it finishes rather dry.

3234,"2007-09-01",4.0,"750, corked and caged. Silkscreened green bottle, unlike the one pictured to the left--certainly in the running for the most attractive, mood-setting beer label in production today. Hazy dark straw color, bordering on medium amber, with a PITA towering thick sudsy platinum blonde head. Gorgeous spicy and lemony nose. Absolutely puts you in the mood for a complex Belgian before you even pick up the glass. Medium body, tingly, almost (but not quite) sharp carb. Lots of lemon, hay, grass, spice, and floral notes. Unfortunately, this bottle burdens them with an oxidation note, but even *with* a hint of aluminum, its a 4.0 beer. Delectable.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

3234,"2007-08-21",4.2,"On tap, Map Room, Chicago.  Never rated this before, so I thought Id give it a go as I usually like tripels.  Head is very impressive, huge, fluffy, rocky and crystalline, leaving dollops of foamy lace on the side.  Smells spicy with some dark bread and faint orange fruitiness in a thick cream.  Seems like you can smell the fluffiness of the head (is that yeast character, or the smell of protein?).  Flavor is supercharged, incredibly full malt character that expands in the mouth.  The main character is like peaches in half and half; yeasty and denatured, aged hops prick on the sides in a somewhat salty counterpoint to the lactic sweetness in the middle.  A yeasty blanket covers the soft and creamy malts, giving this a nice soft texture all the way through.  The finish is delicately dry and long, with black and white pepper and dust from a 17th century attic.

Finishes a bit hot actually, which is surprising cause the ABV isnt that high.  Tastes dry on the throat and slightly chalky, with lingering caramel and pilsner malt flavors.

Tripel Karmeliet pours a surprisingly clear straw golden with hints of orange around the edges. Numerous big carbonation bubbles rise from every surface of the glass. 1+ finger pure white head formed on the pour and stayed right where its at. Each sip left thick drink lines. World class looking brew.

The aroma is mouthwatering. Its light and subtle but hugely complex. Candi sugar leads the way but is eased aside by mounds of golden fruits. Pear, apple skins and golden raisins. Lightly toasted malts hide in the background along with a hint of the wheat used to brew. Spicy alcohol presence really livens things up. Wonderful aroma!

The flavor goes hand in hand with the aroma. Pears, apples, the golden raisins again, and apricot. When I smell and drink this tripel all I can think of is a basket of this freshly picked fruit gleaming in the sunlight. Funny? I know, but true. Perfect candi sugar sweetness with a subtle spicy alcohol to really open things up.

Body is on the lighter side of medium and becomes creamy and airy when it hits the tongue. Massaging carbonation.

This is a beer I could drink all day long which is something I cant say about a lot of Belgians. The glass in front of me is disappearing far to quickly. 

Im not the most expierenced with tripels but Ive sampled a fair amount and so far this is the top of the line for me. World class beer that is easy to find. This will be in my fridge from now on.

3234,"2007-08-02",3.9,"7/11/2007:  Tripel Karmeliet is clear, golden yellow in color.  The initial head is creamy and off-white and slowly collapses to leave a lasting crown.  The carbonation level is mild and soft.  There is a nice maltiness to the nose along with a hint of sweetness and spice.  The flavor is soft with a nice balance of malt, fruits, and spice.  It isnt too sweet, too spicy, or too alcoholic (astringent) tasting.  The body is medium-full and smooth.  There is an obvious weight and creaminess to this beer from the oats.

Other notes include  pear, banana, light honey, esters, musty yeast, and light clove, maybe faint floral hops.

3234,"2007-05-20",4.1,"Pours a deep, clear gold with a thick, pillowy nearly-white head that subsides into an endless, thin, white lining of bubbles over the liquid. The aroma is sugar, fruit (banana), honey-like malts, and yeast. It is very inviting and very Belgian. The flavor starts with a soft, fruity spice (hints of clove and black pepper) and lots of delicious, doughy malt.  The middle of the tongue picks up flavors of grassy hops, some alcohol, and more sweet malts. The middle of the tongue also detects more fruit (bananas, perhaps a hint of pear). The beer has a long finish with banana, sugar, and spice. The finish is quite warming, too. The mouthfeel is medium in body and creamy yet stinging with carbonation.

This pours like any other pale yellow american ubiquitous lager as far as color goes. Has a clean white head. Aroma is not outstanding and  there are a few streams of carbonation rising with in. The tap handle on this is cool looking. Initial flavor is slightly strong but definitely  not oppressive. Much milder than the domestic coarse trippels Ive tasted such as Southern Tier. Interesting off flavor on the onset and then it immediately fades to an alky hint. Again, this is not oppressive, it is just that you can tell the alky content is letting you know its there if you want to notice. Low carbonation, very little tingle on the back of the throat. I am not overly impressed with this beer and will probably get hammered for my numbers. This trippel just does not appeal to my delicate girlie taste buds.  THe alky is continually apparent but not in the face. Finish is immediately medium bitter but fades after a few moments to just a memory.

Nice lace. Spicy, vanilla, banana, fruity aroma. Highly carbonated and suprisingly hoppy taste - gone is the fruit; instead there is light malting and perfectly balanced hops. The carbonation is working against me on this one - a little too gassy. A mooth milky taste and texture betrays its wheat & oat content.

I chuckled to myself as I recalled the old Miller ""champagne of beers"" campaign as I popped the cork out of this legitimate claimant of that title.  This looked and poured like a barley champagne ... pale yellow with a gigantic poofy, airy, bright white carbonic head that actually squeezes atop my tulip glass and stands on its own with a 1/4-inch protruding well beyond the lip before it subsides, slowly and elegantly.  The aroma is airy and extremely fruity, not unlike a carbonated lemonade!  This drinks like a dream ... light and airy, with light and fruity flavors, yet with a big robust character.

Triplel K is a favourite for not only its taste, but also the tulip glass, adorned with the fleur de lais - a symbol sacred to New Orleanians. Right, the beer. Wheat in colour with floaty white head. Wheat grain nose with orange, lemon and subtle berries. The taste progresses naturally through the mouth. Sweet, spicey, then salty. Notes of orange and dates float about, but if you ask me, it tastes just like a soft pretzel. Nice, warm alcohol finish. Spot on.","Greater London, ENGLAND","reakt"
3234,"2007-02-11",3.4,"Nice, sweet aroma.  Slightly cloudy amber appearance--very attractive.  Creamy head.  Initial and finish flavor is heavily sweet--too sweet for me after half the bottle.  The taste is unique: flowery bread with hints of apple, grape, and honey...and even less lemon.  Not much hops.  Cannot taste the 8% alcohol at all.  This is what chicks should drink instead of malternative alcopop.","Kansas, USA","keith0718"

This is the archetype of the classic blonde tripel, what it lacks in originality it makes up with a perfect balance.  Initial honey and fruity flavours (banana + tropical fruits) settle in a warm moderately sweet body full of bready malts.  Some crisp hops at the end for a short finish.  Very little in the way of spices.  Among my favourite blonde tripels.

3234,"2007-01-21",4.4,"The 25.4 ounce champagne-like bottle poured a hazy apricot colored beverage with a medium sized off-white creamy head that was fully lasting and left great lacing on the glass. The aroma was a spell-binding, complex melding of fruitiness and spices complimented by a brandy-like backdrop. Apricots, cinnamon, coriander, sweet orange, all wrapped up in brandy-like package. The body was medium-full with a lively, but soft carbonation and a silky smooth texture. The flavor starts off sweet with all the aromas coming through in the flavors. The finish was long with the sweetness being consistent throughout. There was also a wonderful alcohol warmth that built through the finish.

Onto the immense flavors... Ultra-fruity, but not too sweet or sour... very tasty, unique, bready, sweet malts (maybe the oats have something to do with it?), also a serious presence of hops.

Pours a pale straw color with a towering four finger head, even with a very gentle pour. Im not sure the head is ever going to fade away. The lacing that is left behind is thick and chunky.

Smell; very floral with lots of tropical fruits. Some gentle spices come out, along with a bit of citrus and earthy yeastiness.

Taste; this is a very sweet and fruity tripel, with oranges, peaches, apricots and many others that I cant place. The yeasts add a bit of chalkiness, and the spices are a touch peppery, with almost no alcohol noticeable in the profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and drinkability is very good, but with the sweetness and abundance of fruit flavors I would not be able to drink more than one of these.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

I just finished an Imperial Stout so I probably should not be rating this beer, because it is SO different and a style I typically do not consume.  Strong aroma of...hell I dont know, citrus, wheat and that typical ""belgium"" smell.  Flavor is something like citrus, possibly plum, mild spices, and a wheaty touch.

3234,"2007-01-03",3.6,"Golden-brown with a half-inch white head with big bubbles - fades to an eighth inch halfway through the experience.  Think of a big, juicy ripe orange studded through with cloves.  The wheat used here really comes through in an aroma fairly reminiscent of a subdued Belgian wit.  On the tongue this is surprisingly crisp as opposed to dominantly sweet:  bananas, slight pineapple acidity that lends some tartness, tart apples, little to no spice character and no alcohol apparent.  Lighter on the tongue than expected; quite drinkable. Really missing that spice (beyond the prototypical clove) that some tripels (Chimays, for example) have going on.  Agree with the one-dimensional sentiment.","Ithaca, New York, USA","dmradus"

I took the bottle from the cooler, apparently a hell of a strong preassure when opening it, so theres beer on the floor. Not enough with that, ready to rate the beer, my beerglass suddently decides to break. Oh well. The rest of the beer was rated with very big caution. I even thought ""What would Nikki Sixx do?"" before I going step by step in rating this one. So it is very champagneish, pale golden colour, lots of carbonation and huge head. Nose is very spicy, acidic fruity and sting of alcohol. Flavour is fruit, wheat, old sour apples, with some spices and other fruits in it. The finish is almost bittery hoppy. A very wellbalanced and wellmade tripel, which in fact can be separated from the masses with a nice full body and pleasant palate.

3234,"2006-12-24",3.6,"Karmeliet Tripel (BB June 2007)
Lighter in colour than expected  murky light amber. Very persistent thin, creamy head, quite impressive actually. Sweet malty nose, good balance, slight edge of cooked fruits. Surprisingly light to taste given the style and the 8% abv. Malt power evident on the nose eases off somewhat but the balance remains. Mild fruity notes lurk under the initial layer of malt sweetness and some faint hoppy notes to finish.  Shows a heap of elegance (the beers most attractive feature) and would go close to being the most easy drinking tripel I have ever consumed. Ive found the Karmeliet a touch abrasive in the past and it should be noted I cellared this beer for about 9 months so perhaps the short term aging contributed to the smooth palate? A winter beer for summer perhaps

This tripel poured a beautiful golden straw color with a monstrous white gleaming head.  My initial impression of the aroma was that it had possibly been skunked, but my concerns were abated after it had a chance to warm up.  The nose was full of belgian yeast, sweet fruits, and a mild tinge of alcohol.  From the first taste, I knew I had something special on my hands.  The flavors of sweet caramel sugar, candy malts, dried fruit, and a character that I cannot describe.  In my short ratebeer experience, I have run across few tastes that have left me at a loss, but there was one in this brew.  The mouthfeel is really what put this great brew into the elite category.

Snow-white head was thick and pillowy, and lingered through the entire drink, and reduced to excellent lacing up and down the glass. Aroma was a very pleasant blend of floral hops and spices, mostly clove and corriander. Taste was more of the same spices and floral hops, reminded me a lot of Duvel at this stage. Very long smooth finish topped this beer off. The only thing I noticed was that the alcohol became a little to evident at late glass, and I would recommend not letting hte beer warm all the way.

What was the brewer thinking!  other than that it was a good brew.  good bubbly mouthfeel.  slightly fruity, with cloves and a cheesy flavor.  blond beer with big chunks of yeast.  I think Ill need to re-rate it when in Im in Europe.  I leave in 8 days now.  RERATE: on tap in McEwans in Lille, France:  The aroma was superb and came out past the smoke in the bar even.  Lovely yeasty aroma with some malts lingering in the backgound, and some spices slightly sugery and peppery.  came off the tap a golden blond with lovely billowing head that retained very well.

With the recomendation from the fine folks at Hollingshead I drank this beer at room temp to bring out the carmel flavor.  After removing the metal cage, the cork flew off and the bottle began to pour out and I lost a little bit to the floor.  The brew pours straw color and has a cloudy pillowy foamy head.

The lacing was outstanding. The aroma was mostly light fruits with a touch of spice. The flavor was just great: rich but not too thick in mouthfeel, with a definite candy sugar sweetness supporting a citrus (orange) tongue that finished with great hoppiness. Yeast flavors were subdued and less prominent than in other tripels. Mouthfeel was pretty heavily carbonated, but the body thinner than most tripels (ie. more drinkable and very pleasant).

First sip revealed a sweet malty taste with very little hop taste.  The beer had what I wrote was a ""mature"" alcohol taste...a sweet, pleasant slightly burning sensation, like a bourbon.

After some recent bad experiences with what must have been very old imported beer, I have to say this brought me back into the fold.  8% alcohol probably helps this beer stand up over time...and a 98% rating likely means that it moves off the shelf in a reasonable amount of time.

3234,"2006-01-26",3.7,"Quite entranced by the obscenely big tulip glass, I began drinking this one a few years back without realising I had never stopped to rate it. Quite hard to get a hold of in 2003, it seems to be everywhere now losing a little of its charm in the process. Poured a year old bottle into its own glass, quite cool to meet the hot summer we are currently having. Huge head rose to the brim of the glass before dying back to a spiders web of white froth. The beer itself a brilliant orange, the same hue as lucozade, with a charge of ultra fine bubbles rising up to atmosphere. Summery fruits dominate the aroma like pears, cantaloupe, pineapple and grapefruit, all tossed together in a juicy fruit salad. Lighter notes of lemon soda just seem to top it off. Quite sweet in the mouth on the first sip, but this dies off so quickly into a tangy and slightly drying back end with a touch of white rum coming in late. Strong notes of sweetened orange juice, feint lemon and lime, clean rye and wheat flavours, and a hint of orange peel mingle with degrees of success on the tongue before finishing quite short and crisp in the swallow. Light on the tongue, not thin in body but leaning towards it, yet surprisingly generous in flavour, this is a unique beer that doesnt carry the normal qualities of its style. A Summer quencher it is, but it may just fail in the cooler months against the more in-your-face Tripels. Otherwise its quite nice!!! (33cL, 14/09/06, Intl Beer Shop, W.

Lots to smell here: wheaty, yeasty, citrus oil, vanilla cookie, sweet spices.... it seems to transform as you drink it! All the flavours to match, but with a bigger wheat backbone on the palate. For a tripel this is fresh and strangely light despite the high alcohol, this is a terrific beer for a special occasion (too expensive to drink regularly-- $9.00 per bottle in my local bottle shop).","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

Carbonation bubbles appears to be rather big and the head is long lasting but uneven. There is a good balance between sweetness and bitterness and the wheat malt is clearly noticeable, but with little bit of citrus to add freshness. You notice the alcohol but it is not excessive, and with long refreshing and a little dry aftertaste, this is the triple of choice!","8000 Århus C, DENMARK","unibaren"

Spicy (clove and corriander) and yeasty aroma.  Very floral and sweet (honey and caramel) as well.  Mouthfeel is rather dry, spicy and astringent, but sweet and smooth at the same time.  Aspects of floral hops, granny smith apples, more honey and more caramel  and a ton of peppery spices in the flavor.  I remember a few samples from a 750 to be a little lighter and fluffier in the mouthfeel.  Either way, it goes down smooth, sweet (not cloying) and dry.

Taste is again, subtle, as is the aroma. Good but not knocking my socks off.
Mouthfeel is ok. A tad sticky and gummy in the mouth with mild sweetness and a dry finish.

The aroma is spicy with notes of sharp ginger, vanilla, clove, tart pear, plus earthy spices like coriander and grains of paradise.  The aroma is quite enticing and zippy.  The taste is sweet up front and actually get a bit sweeter as the beer moves across my tongue.  The high carbonation levels cause it to dance across my tongue and helps to offset the sweetness.  The spicy, herbal, astringent character of this beer also helps to offset the sweetness.  This beer has notes of orange peel, ginger, pepper, and a bit of cardamom and clove.  This beer is quite tasty, but would be that much better if it was not quite so sweet.

3234,"2005-09-04",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2006 Re-rate 1/16/06: A totally different experience this time.  A lovely, creamy triple with some nuttiness.  This experience was amongst the best Ive had with a Tripel.  Appearance was completely more pleasing than with the originally-reviewed bottle.  I think my first rating was of a bad bottle.


Old rating (3.4) and review:

Rated ""blind"" in separate notepad prior to seeing RateBeer averages, as it should be.

Highly acidic and/or alcoholic.  I was expecting creamy given the style, but got bitingly alcoholic.  Head is fizzy and diminishes to half foam layer, half no foam at all.  The semi-clear yellow, not cloudy, may be a tip-off to its not being creamy.  Aroma hard to pick up.  Very gassy, bubbly, lots of carbonation.  There are other Tripels Ill go for over this.  Good for a beer; disappointing for a Tripel.  7/10.

Added after entering the above in Ratebeer (no change in rating, though): grassy and dry.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

The taste is quite beery but with yeasty, oaty, hopsy, all sorts of this-is-hella-good-for-you flavours... like some sort of healthy breakfast cereal. Nice and tart in the finish. Absolutely lovely!","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

In the final glass from the bottle there are a ton of floating objects, both visible and impossible to ignore as you sip in thunk thunk thunk, like pieces of fruit in your smoothie or shake through a straw (if not so severely).   Body is medium and creamy with tons of soft, foamy and a dry finish.  Aroma of cellar and barn filled with a spiciness from which I can only discern clove for certain.  A scent of sugar and fruit.  Unfortunately there is a metallic scent in here as well...how it got into a corked bottle Ive no idea.  Flavor is sugary sweet and fruity, pear, apple, and others.  Some lightly sour musk, like cellar and dough, but mostly earthy.  Bitter sweet finish, sugar and spice!  Wood, clove, touch of citrus and an aftertaste dominated by sasafras, licorice and sugar.  Noticable alcoholic warmth, but pleasant and definitely quenching.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"

3234,"2005-04-10",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2005 330 ml. bottle was carefully decanted into a tulip without yeast, revealing a beer with a golden yellow body with an enormous head fed by highly active carbonation.  The nose was fruity with notes of sour apple, pear, and peach.  There were also some earthy yeast tones that didnt quite rise to the level of barnyard funk. 

The taste was dry and sour with some bitterness lingering in the back. I could detect tart flavors like granny smith apples, apricots, and pomegranates.  The dryness was slightly woody and herbal in nature.  There were also some saffron spicy notes here.

The aftertaste was grassy and light with slowly fading spices.  Alcohol was well hidden and did not play much of a role in here.

3234,"2005-04-08",4.2,"Hazy orange glow for color, with a booming 2"" head thats creamy and foamy.  Some sediment in glass.  Wonderful Belgian lace on the glass as the head begins to fade.  Aroma is predominantly pepper, cloves, wheat and sugar.  Some sourdough characteristics contribute to its mild, pleasing and floral rose smell.  Flavor is pepper, coriander and clove phenols, paired  with a sugary yeast complexion.  Citrus-orange, sweet and spicy.  Traces of lemon grass surface as it warms more.  Aroma also takes on a more lemony smell with amplified scents of alcohol as it warms.  Effervescent; solid body composure.  Alcohol is evident and warming, but isnt distracting or overpowering.  Moderately carbonated, substantial weight, due in large part to the great chewy malt presence.  Finish is mildly sweet and spicy with a smooth hint of bitterness.  All in all, a non-aggressive, pleasing tripel that youd be hard pressed to find anyone who doesnt enjoy it in some capacity.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Aroma of apricot-skin, light peach esters, a bit of vanilla and some good malt and/or candi sugar.  Flavor is full and round, with plenty of fruit notes but also a bit of light sourness from the wheat.  A good, even, lightly creamy body, which can probably be attributed, in part, to the oats.  Light bubble gum, bananas, vanilla and more ripe, lightly tart fruitiness from the yeast.  Good in all aspects, with a medium to medium-full body, pleasant, low carbonation and a great balance, tending towards the malty side.  Doughy chewiness can be found as it breathes and warms.  A touch of alcohol warmth, like peaches soaked in brandy and cointreau, adds a nice punch to the finish and give further character.

Small white head which dimished, although the glassware was less than perfect. Fruity aroma with apple dominating, almost cider like.

3234,"2005-02-01",3.8,"Tasted 21/01/2005.  3L bottle from Regional Wines and Spirits.
Enjoyed this one with TheGrandmaster and Tyrrell as pre-dinner drink at Great India.
Pours a relatively bright gold for a tripel, almost no cloudiness.  Nice temperature, cool but not chilled, means were giving this a chance to show off its best properties.  Airy white head releases a soft bouquet of malt and wheat with some stone fruit yoghurt from the yeast (apricot, nectarine, peach).  Very smooth medium-bodied mouthfeel with a softer carbonation than Ive got from the majority of the tripels Ive tried.  The lack of the usual tripel spiciness probably intensifies this smoothness.  Palate is sweetish, but cleans out nicely.  As youd guess, starting the night with an 8% ale really gets the chatter going (but I cant give out extra marks for its social lubricant quality).

There is also wine in it.  The taste is basically the same as the aroma with hops.  The sweetness of this beer makes it unique.  The aftertaste is kind of like a wine aftertaste.

Yellow, slightly hazy, color, good creamy white head. Aroma is light: fruity and malty. Oily, sweetish, alcoholic, hoppy. Smooth, carbonated mouthfeel. Gives long warming aftertaste. Decent, not bad but current RB score of 3.9 feels a bit overrated compared to my score :) (5/2/7/3/10 2.7)
Re-rated bottle 33cl (BB 08/2012)
Because of my ""bad"" rating in 2004, sayravai gave me this bottle as a XMas present and I promised to rerate it. 
Golden brew, a bit murky after yeast added, white head is mostly vanishing. Aroma is fruity with pineapple and peach mixed with notes of pine needles. Medium to full bodied. Palate is oily, good strong malty backbone. The first impression is exotic fruityness: apricot, honey and banana. Hops pick up in the finish. Aftertaste is sweet fruity, backed with some alcohol.

Alcohol slightly present, but feels like an ingredient - not a negative thing. Just an inch too sweet from being the perfect tripel! Awesome!

The aroma is milder, earthy, saison-like, with lemon and lots of moldy cellar. The flavor is also milder with less fruity sweetness, and more yeasty, moldy sourness.

Absolute happiness results from a mere sip of this glorious brew, growing with each new drip down the lips!
Yeast, also, does some work towards delivering the drinker to Beer Nirvana, creating a warm, bready feeling. Body is somewhat light and buoyant, palate is delicate and delicious. Soft, sweet malt, long and lingering, rewarding finish, always accompanied by a tidy, tasteful dance of hops upon the tongue. Ahhhhhhh!
Unfortunately, this happy ride was all-too brief, for the otherwise unredoubtable pub poured a meager 8 ounces. Geez, guys, Id pay an extra $.50 for another 2 ounces, and willingly, too!

I was baffled by the amount of fizziness this beer produced... it was almost champagne like. The head was high, frothy and light. This combination of exorbitant fizziness and towering spume was daunting, but the aroma leapt out of the glass and agilely enchanted my olfactory nerves. A tinge of honey haze, gently layered upon deep caramel and oceans of alcohol. Tripel Karmeliet is a hearty beer at 8%, but it wears its obvious wealth as a diaphanous crown.

3234,"2004-02-02",4.5,"750 ml. green champagne bottle. Corked and caged. Best before date of 01/01/2007. Must be really fresh then. Loud pop actually shot the cork out forcefully. Good thing I had a grip on it. Poured out a dark straw yellow color, with a neverending humongous white, meringue like head. Thick enough to float a bottle cap.
Aromas are of fresh cut hay, spicy apricots, some pineapple, and lactic wheat notes. Big yeast presence as well. Thick matting and huge lacing from the beer. Very effervescent, highly carbonated. Carbonic bite is present in the mouthfeel, but nothing overpowering.
Rich, thick mouthfeel, and spicy hops blend to make an excellent triple. I really like this one. You might too.","","Cobra"

3234,"2003-12-12",4.6,"Super clear golden yellow with some steady distributed carbonation bubbles flowing within, a finger high white head of thick froth that retains for a bit, settles to a thick puffed haze on top remaining present the whole glass down, lace begins as sheets but falls apart quickly leaving webby globs. 

Aroma is quite complex and very interesting with a ton of stuff going on, mainly an overall dulled orange peel zest with a sweet sour dough bread rolled into a musty/musky yeastyness that gives it a nice smokey appeal that gives it some brothyness and makes it almost seem like the fruit has rotted or something. Doesn't sound good but man its nice, notes of banana, nectarine, lime, lemon zest, pepperjack, moldy wood, wet dirt, onion, tomato, boy I could continue with all the soupy & fruity things mixing in the smell of this thing but I think I'll stop there before my nose explodes. Wow!

Surprisingly enough the taste comes across nearly the same as the smell but its not as potent and not quite as complex as what the smell hints too. There's a nice tangy sour dough bread malt sweetness to its front, oats and wheat make for some incredible sweetening and the middle is speckled with notes of different dullish citrus fruits of orange, lemon, pineapple, and lime, some slight yeasty tang and light spice of clove and meat broth makes a brief appearance as not to overwhelm that are note worthy from midway all the way to the finishing areas where it leaves more twangy sweetness and light citrus in the finish. 

Feel is a solid medium body with a wierd smoothness thats hard to fathom, but reminded me of light soup. Whats with the soup aspects of this beer? Actually has a nice hold of carbonation that seems to fit the citrusy sweetness and the finish has a subtle complexity of things portrayed in the smell. Politely skipping across is a lime-like twinge left on the lips after each sip. One hell of an interesting Triple, this is more of what I look for from a Triple other then a mega hefe profile of clove and yeast thats been multiplied. This was very interesting and now I am left wondering if its like this all the time. Reviews of this seem to be widely diverse so I will definately get some more soon and try again to make sure this is something that continues to comes across as the same.

Aroma was a riotous blast of Belgian funk, spicy and very yeasty.  Flavor was initially yeasty, with pepper, spice, oatmeal, and, sadly, anise.  The licorice flavor grew as it warmed, eventually overwhelming the other notes in the beer.  And I hate licorice.  Disappointing, I had been looking forward to this.

The nose is a yeasty and sweet, note of honey and orange. The flavor is also yeasty, spicy; loads of independent notes of citrus, tangerines are most prevalent, hints of coriander and black pepper.

Carbonation perhaps slightly too high for my liking but the slight fizz really works with the flavours. Great stuff. (4.5)Re-rate: Had this in Belgium and I just cant keep it at such a high rating.

Hazy golden color with a pretty fine white head, rather large, but it doesnt stay up its throne long. Superb aroma of flowers and fruits. Im really tempted. Very complex flavor developments in mouth. I cant count all those fruits: orange, banana, apples, lemon. Was that butter? Spicy, yeasty. Refreshing tartness spreading out, more hops than most triples. Comfortable medium mouthfeel that bites the tongue a bit when too fresh, its so easy to drink its not even funny. Pleasant aftertaste. Almost ridiculously complex. The perfect type of beer I wish to have more of immediatly once Im done with the first bottle. Delicious, the best tripel Ive had up to now. Two thumbs up.  A recent sampling have changed my opinion a bit. Either I was less sensible or it just isnt as pleasant to me, but the coriander sums to a bit too much. It remains very complex, but despite remembering it very sweet, I remembered more noble and juicy hops procuring more balancing bitterness. For now, it remains way above your average triple, but I cant like it as much as Allagash. Bumping down from 4.6 to 4.2. Still loving the way those cereals work together, the nose is great and expressive, but Id like it more with more hops and less coriander.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Aroma is toasty with a apricot and apple aroma, vinous but smooth, slightly tart and soapy. Some barny complexities come in the note after a strenuous sniffing session. Flavor is smooth and initially full of citrus from the hops then finishes with a biscuit malt background. Rolls right through your tongue and into your palate.

This one opened like champagne and poured just the same with a high carbonation and a champagne like head. The head settles down to a creamy dense froth and rests there the duration. Lacing is subtle and scattered inside the glass in various places. Tiny streams of bubbles rise gallantly from the bottom of the glass throughout the session. Aroma is fruity and spicy with a subtle earthiness to it. The mouthfeel is like a comfortable pillow, smooth and delicate with a warming finish. Flavor is as complex as any good Tripel Ive had and the use of three grains enhances the complexity even more. Fruity, earthy sweet and a full complex malt flavor. Yeast is also very much in the flavor. This bottle was good to the very last drop and I enjoyed it completely. 5/30/10 RE-RATE Im moving this one up to my top Tripel. A 33cl bottle as fresh as you can get.  Same cloudy appearance with an initially large snow white head tha reduces to a layer of film.

Nice fizz, just all around a lovely, lovely beer.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
3234,"2003-08-09",4.2,"Golden amber, dense and big white head.  Powdery aroma of orange, pollen, with herbal notes, icing sugar, banana in the finish.

I really didn't find the aroma that great, it was kind of skunky in fact. ..ah, there we go....less head if you drink straight from the bottle. Taste is mainly just sweetness until the finish.

A new flavor is unmasked with eac sweet sip, the first being slightly reminiscent of granny smith apples, following with bananas, raspberries, cloves and spices with a bittersweet clove honey aftertaste.

After a while, a sharp roasted malt smell comes up, spicy. Sweet, malty taste, but with a sharp, nearly adstringent mouthfeel, like partly roasted malt - strange for such a pale beer. The oats? Spicy and fruiy, but foremost malty. As said, sharp mouthfeel, medium-bodied. It could be refreshing but for that roasted flavour. A beer with a very high emphasis on grain and malt. Not uninteresting, but not very exciting. A bit of a hype, and with the role of the spectacular glass, that sounds familiar for this brewery.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

Also, notable amounts of carbonation make this beer attractive.  The nose is very nice as well, with a balance of malt, yeast, and spices, but I wish it were a bit more pronounced, as its a little light on the nose.  However, the lack of power in the nose shouldnt take away from the fact that the nose IS very nice!  The flavor is incredibly delicious.  Its fairly light, fruity, spicy, and a little sweet, with a nice dryness in the finish.

well rounded tripel.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","maestro"

3234,"2003-06-17",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 22, 2004 Rerate 10/22/2004: 750ml corked bottle: I don't know if it's the bottle size or what, but the second time around was quite pleasant with this beer.  Not as highly carbonated as the smaller bottle and it seemed more complex and balanced. Nice sweet Belgian malty flavor and bready palate throughout.  A good tripel.

6/17/2003: 330ml capped bottle: Very lightly clouded golden color with a large fast-fading white head.  Aroma is mostly sweet caramel with some pepper.  Tremendous carbonation throughout.  Perhaps a corked version would have been slightly less carbonated.  Flavors are hard to detect through the fizz, but sweet buttery caramel toffee lingers in the finish.  A little too sticky sweet and definitely too much carbonation detract from this otherwise good Belgian tripel.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

3234,"2003-05-22",4.8,"Initial pour of 3 inches resulted in all foam.  After letting it rest I was able to get the rest of the beer in the glass and was it worth the wait.  A slightly hazy honey color with lively carbonation and a large uneven creamy white head.  Sweet ripe dried apple/pear aroma with malt, vanilla, honey, and hints of bananna and toffee.  The head is incredibly lasting in its fullness, much like a drink with whipped cream you cant help but get some on your upper lip, it does make it difficult to taste the beer itself but enhances the overall effect of drinking the beer.  Taste is slightly sweet fruit, hints of spices and oak with an acidity cutting the sweetness some.  A honey dry finish.  Excellent.","Ohio, USA","redlem"
3234,"2003-05-21",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 17, 2006 This was consumed with ice cream blended with the beer and apricots. I dont think it was a good mix as this is a lively beer that is more suited as a palate cleanser. A light aroma with a vigourous light yeastiness. In context it started and maintained an acidic finish. Too fizzy for the meal. Still a good beer in the right setting. 

RE-RATE: and about time too. Sincethis early rate I have had this beer a number of times and question what I was thinking when I gave this such low marks. A delightful beer that satisfies in any season of the year. Silly me.","Potts Point, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA","Sully"

Initial aroma of cloves, pepper, slight bubble gum, fruit(maybe juicy fruit gum), sweet maltiness, and even a little earthy and leathery; The yeastiness if fairly subdued.  The head on this beer just does not want to go away!   Malty version of a tripel w/ some green raisin flavors, cloves, a slight hop aftertaste, but balanced toward malt.  Very highly carbonated for an explosive sensation in the mouth w/ a medium light body and smooth mouthfeel, not harsh or astringent; Alcohol is barely noticable, but slightly warming.

While having the Karmeliet I get a flood of Belgian memories. Spicey yeasty farmscapes, small beer cafes in Turnhout and those Belgian chocolates. A consistently excellent Belgian beer jewel. I think 4 ratings of around 4.5/5 is enought so it will probably be my final rating for a while on this one.  
Third Rating: 4.5	8/15/2002 4.5This beer has slowly become one of my favourite Belgian Blond beers. Impressive erectile, fluffy lasting stand up out of the glass, variable bubbled, white head. Beer is white desert wine colour. Citrus,  hops, caramel, doughy grainy malt and spicy fruit aromas. Tingling sweet sour bitter start with a fruity palate and a hint of asprin. Smooth luscious zingy faintly alcoholic middle. Beautiful floral sweet doughy sour finish and fruity watermelon aftertaste.  Being quite fruity and sweet this beer  goes very well with many deserts.

Sept, 2002 Pale golden colour. Nose is sherbety and spicy, with hints of vanilla, cloves, cinnamon and coriander, plus  bubblegum and a touch of soap. In the mouth it is quite honey sweet balanced by sour citrus-fruit notes - lemon and lime, with a touch of pineapple. Finish is citrusy, sweet and cloying. Chewy-thick, with a power taste suggesting a much higher alcohol content. [2.5]
June, 2012 330ml bottle Chrissie brought back from Bruge. Hazy blonde with foamy head. OK. Yeasty, wheaty nose with banana esters and woody and citric notes - some soap, faint spice, dry, mildly alcoholic. OK. Mouthfeel is dry, chalky, mildly alcoholic, some carbonation prickles. OK. Flavour is soft, with entwined and attractive notes of vanilla, citrus, flowers, soap and faint chocolate. The combination of all the elements is softly attractive and beguiling, though not especially impressive. Its a good, drinkable strong pale ale, rather like Duvel or Chimay White, and worth exploring further. I certainly enjoyed and appreciated it more this time than I did 10 years ago.

Head is initially large, frothy/fizzy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy medium yellow, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly to moderately hoppy (flowers, herbs), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of coriander, ginger, lemon zest, honey.

Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

I still dont consider this a tripel.  Its not very yeasty, its too sweet, and its seemingly quite spice-heavy.  My rating is as a generic Belgian Strong Ale.
