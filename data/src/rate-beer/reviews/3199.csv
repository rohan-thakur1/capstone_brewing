3199,"2014-10-21",2.6,"A present from my cousin, to let me taste something different. It is a kind of lager special, easy to drink, but medium compared with all the range of beers. Good aftertaste and appearance. Good.","","MarcHS"
3199,"2014-04-28",3.3,"[Bottle] Pours a darker yellow color with a bit of white head. Light bready aroma. Taste is of biscuit, light caramel and crackers. Crisp and light grassy hops come forward in the finish. Somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Despite the RateBeer classification, this is not a pale lager. Pretty good.","Illinois, USA","troyc"
3199,"2014-03-06",3.1,"March 6, 2014 - bottle at Iron Horse. Clear copper pour with some head and minimal lacing. Aroma and taste of light citrus, grain and malt. Very mild bitter finish.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
3199,"2014-02-12",1.4,"This is a top 1% pale lager? Woo boy. The light brown pour is not too pretty but the label is cool, and the best thing about it. A Sprecher release, but the label calls it the Buffalo Water Beer Company - is this a bogus brand? There is plenty of corn sugar and yeast in the flavor - blah. The body is fairly thin. The aroma is mostly yeast with a dash of flowers. This stuff is not a blonde ale, despite its name. I didnt like it at all! I would take squirrel water or donkey water over this buffalo piss.","USA","Slipstream"
3199,"2013-10-26",2.6,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2013 Hazy Amber Color, Huge Bubbly Head, Lots Of Lacing. Dull Aroma of Malt and Dough. Taste of Malt, Dough, Butter, Light Bitter Hop Finish.  Over Carbonated, Medium Body. Seems to be Slightly Past its Prime. Whole Experience is like a roller coaster. Buy it open minded, check where it is made and expectations are down, check the ratings and hopes are up. After Tasting it, once again down since this beer is disappointing. Overrated no question about it. Mediocre, Average at best... Pass It...","Hickory Hills, Illinois, USA","Fredis23"
3199,"2013-08-05",2.8,"Pours a cloudy golden with a medium, short lasting, white head. The aroma contains floral hops, yeast, cereal, and some light fruity lemon. Taste brings out a good deal of lemon tartness that balances with yeast and cereal. Its pretty straight forward with this one. Not much else. Lingering aftertaste of lemon. The body is light, with a thin, slightly sticky texture, soft sudsy carbonation. I find this one pretty boring.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"
3199,"2013-06-23",2.6,"Bottle at the Old Fashioned - Pours clear golden just as youd expect, with a foamy white head. Nose is corn and grain, with subtle herbal hops. Taste is the same--grainy with a little bitter bite on the finish. Typical over-carbonated mouthfeel. Dont really get the high reviews on this one. Its decent for a pale lager, but its still just a pale lager.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
3199,"2012-04-01",4.0,"Poured from a bottle. Foamy white and lacey head. Malty aroma. Sweet malt beginning. Finishes with a mildly bitter hop. Very nice for a lager.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","lagermeister"
3199,"2012-01-05",3.4,"Pours a pale gold with a nice sized white head. Nose is mostly hops;some cereal grain. Creamy on the palate, it has a pilsner taste but milder, not as bitter, as most of the mass produced pilsners. A refreshing beer but not top tier. Pairs well with many deli sandwiches and of course buffalo wings.","Watertown, Wisconsin, USA","jebert"
3199,"2011-06-27",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2015 At the bar in Iron Horse in Milwaukee. Not an ordinary pale lager. Slightly cloudier and much more rich and more fruit like flavors. Sweeter than expected and more hoppy. Good Stuff. Serving: Bottle","Chicago, Illinois, USA","rubbishystuff"
3199,"2011-06-20",3.9,"small citrus nose, summery smooth and refreshing taste. not meant to be extremely heady I dont think but has a full body. a creamy thick texture and golden hazy appearance.","Colorado, USA","lowernashotah"
3199,"2011-06-13",3.4,"12oz bottle.  Pours a pale yellow color with a small white head.  Aroma is yeasty, corn.  Medium on the palate with fizzy carbonation.  Flavor is sweet, corn, maybe a little malty, and a little bitter hops.  Yellow fizzy beer, but definitely on of the best pale lagers available in my opinion.  A great beer for a hot summer day.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"
3199,"2011-06-08",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2012 Pours a cloudy blonde. Yeasty aroma with lemon. Mild malt taste. Light and easy drinking. Finished with a full hop.","Shorewood, Wisconsin, USA","Belgiumbill"
3199,"2011-05-25",4.7,"Overall nice beer, refreshing lager with more taste than the macro beers out there.  Very nice with some wings.","","ngleason"
3199,"2011-05-15",2.8,"On draft at the Milwaukee Public Market on a Sunday morning.  This is apparently brewed by Milwaukee Brewing Co. just down the street for Milwaukee Ale House.  Clear yellow. Light grains. Dirty hay aroma.  Kinda like a sweeter maltose American light lager. 6/3/4/3/12","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"
3199,"2011-04-08",1.9,"Smells yeasty like cookie dough. Very watered down malt/yeast flavor. Above average looking pour. Overall disappointed by this overpriced goop.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","pkbites"
3199,"2011-03-19",0.5,"I found this beer to be a contract brew much like The Horny Goat from brewed on contract in Stevens Point. This one is brewed at the Milwaukee Brewing Company/Milwaukee Ale House. Just see their ratings and youll understand mine.  One word ""Terrible"".  The only positive is that it did indeed resemble beer.","","milbrewguy"
3199,"2011-03-19",0.5,"This beer was a terrible excuse for even a contract brew!  But I have to say that becky was right a poor attempt.  I wouldnt even keep trying guys your beer is just poor.  Dont expose any taste buds to this one that you dont want destroyed.","","mkebeerguy"
3199,"2011-03-15",2.1,"On tap.  Pours pale golden with a white head.  Aroma of tin, bread, and dough.  A light texture.  A pale lager, enough said.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
3199,"2011-03-04",4.6,"Lighter body, but very crisp. Citrus accent with a lacey head. Rich amber coloring. Nice finishing hop. Purchased a six-pack in South Burlington.","","beergirlvt"
3199,"2011-02-21",1.8,"UPDATED: SEP 13, 2011 Looks like beer, taste like beer, oh its beer. About as generic as you could possibly get. And LOL at the first page being all people with like 10 reviews. Something fishy.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
3199,"2010-09-18",3.2,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2010 Bottle.  Pours a clear glowing straw golden with a lovely tall foamy sudsy sticky white head with great lacing.  Aroma is lightly grassy, light metallic hoppiness, medium tart malty sweetness.  Flavor follows, medium/light metallic bitter hoppiness but a semi-tart fruity sweet malt profile, a bit gritty, touch of toastiness towards the finish with the bitterness, not entirely clean.  Medium/light bodied with larger carbonation that feels a bit flabby.  I cant tell whether I like the aroma or flavor better, each are close to 7s but not quite there.  Nice beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"
3199,"2010-08-11",3.1,"Picked up a sixer of this at the Milwaukee Public Market. Glad to have found this, considering it was completely unexpected. Anways, 12 oz. bottle provides a beer that has a nice, and slightly hazy golden yellow body. The head is quite foamy and lasts for quite some time. There are subtle differences that sets this apart as a pale lager. Touches of light fruit and honey are hitting my nose. Its not very pugnent, but Im happy it doesnt happy that caustic grassy and/or skunky bite. When I say light fruits I believe Im smelling touches of mango. Flavor follows the aroma almost perfectly, that is - touches of fruit (mentioned earlier) and some light honey, and sugar. This is a fine brew, and as long as they stay in the ""Pale Lager"" category, I can see this as being the best pale lager.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"
3199,"2009-12-29",2.9,"Draft at OF.  Thinnish orange-tan color.  Minimal patchy head.  Minimal inoffensive aroma.  Sweet, with a soapy bitter hop balance.  Underwhelming and sub par all the way.  Relatively clean and smooth at best.  Session beer..maybe.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
3199,"2009-08-17",3.3,"Bottle shared by Rogueone at my refrigerator reduction tasting on 8/15/09.  Pours semi-cloudy gold with a thin white head.  Malty aroma with some crisp hop.  Creamy malt flavor with a crisp hop finish.  Not terribly complex, but hell, its a lager.  All things considered, it had more flavor than expected and was nicely balanced.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
3199,"2009-08-07",2.5,"Not sure if Im drinking the same beer as some of these guys.  Pours with a deep gold color but with little head retention.  Its unfiltered and lacks the crisp clarity of most lagers.  The aroma is on the weak side with a little malt and some water mineral character.  Starts with a nice malt burst but is quickly overpowered by a dry astringency that leaves me wanting something else.  Seems like another contract-brewed marketing gimmick.  I wont be buying this again.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","rhinobrau"
3199,"2009-07-01",3.3,"Soft,light malt and grain aroma,much fresher,cleaner then you usually experience in these lagers,straight light grain and maybe a kiss of peach afterglow a quick hit of hop and then an enjoyable fadeout. Flawless,but strictly an accomedation beer,if the price is right,would make an excellent picnic beer","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"
3199,"2009-06-15",3.6,"Pours a pale copper with a dense creamy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Aroma is corn, light fruit, citrus and yeast. Flavor is more hoppy than a typical pale lager, very floral and lemony. Malt is present but only to balance the brew. Medium bodied, dry finish. Not a bad beer.","Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, USA","kmeves"
3199,"2009-05-26",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 31, 2009 A lot of people mention a citrus aroma or hint of citrus flavoring. No fruits are listed in the ingredients, but there is a clean, crisp element which some might attribute to citrus.

This is the only beer my mom will drink, full-flavored with a complete lack of heavy, bitter after-taste. In a city run by Miller Lite, this is a great surprise favorite to every party-goer I present it to.

Recently tried it on-tap at BW3s Oak Creek- even better than out of the bottle!","USA","jork33"
3199,"2009-03-22",3.9,"Had a 23 oz. pour at Buffalo Wild Wings in Milwaukee. Pours a nice cloudy blonde/amber. For a pale lager it has serious body with a nice hoppy, almost dry finish. A fruity lager that also has a complex malt flavor.","USA","raginghophead"
3199,"2009-01-12",2.8,"Some what hoppy and crisp. The name of ""blonde"" is misleadingI didnt expect the flavor i got. amber color with a decent head","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","jbuzz"
3199,"2008-11-02",2.5,"I ordered this beer because I’d never heard of it and they had it on tap at the Transfer Pizzeria on Mitchell in Milwaukee alongside some Lakefront taps.  From the name, i was expecting a blonde ale and hopeful to get some nice fruitiness from this beer, and was a bit disappointed by what I got.  A blonde lager, offering not much flavor other than some tinges of metallic.  Not bad, but flavor-wise reminded me a bit of a Kolsch.  OK, but not really recommendable nor worthy of any serious searching.

Appearance was a slightly hazy blond.  Aroma was non-existent.  Flavor was faintly (if I used my imagination) malty, but offered more metallicness than anything else.  Mouthfeel was pretty thin.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"
3199,"2008-08-18",3.4,"Deep amber color with a decent fizzy head.  Light citrus and yeast aroma.  Flavor is grassy hops and creamy malt.  A pale lager with flavor?  What kind of insanity is this?","Wisconsin, USA","twindadplus2"

3199,"2008-07-21",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2012 Crisp golden/orange color, poured with a decent head that kept well. Smooth, refreshing, not too hoppy, very drinkable. if possible, tastes better on tap than out of a bottle. Good first beer! Just had this again. Its gotten better.",", USA","mkebeerparty"
3199,"2008-07-08",4.2,"Tap at the Milwaukee Ale House. I ordered it with buffalo wings, as I was told that they pair up well from a friend. Poured a cloudy golden with an orange tint. Above average head that kept. Smelled of yeast and some citrus. Full hoppy flavor, especially for a lager, but was not filling and went down smooth. At only about 4% ABV having a couple is not a problem. Great first brew, highly recommended!","Brighton, Massachusetts, USA","pcurran41"
3199,"2008-06-17",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 24, 2008 I recently tried a couple of Bison Blondes on tap at Dairyland Greyhound Park.  It is crisp like a lager but with a hop level more like most ales.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Carson"
3199,"2008-06-04",3.0,"Pours a cloudy golden colour with a full white head. Aroma is sort of yeasty, wheat, honey and tropical fruit. Taste is creamy, fruit forward with a pretty strong malt taste throughout.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","phishpond417"
3199,"2008-04-20",2.9,"Golden with a medium off-white head.  Aroma of corn, yeast and light honey.  Mild flavor of honey, corn.  Finishes a bit strange with a chalky finish, but overall a good effort for a pale lager.","Oak Creek, Wisconsin, USA","esjaygee"
3199,"2008-02-21",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 13, 2009 Found this brand new brew at a  tasting in Milwaukee. They ran out it very quickly. Bright orange straw color. Good full head. Nice carbination. Lots of character. Not very hoppy,  Finish was good, but not great. Overall, the best new beer at the event. I can only find it on tap though. Just had this again in December. The best pale lager made in Wisconsin, maybe the US.","USA","kegqueen"
3199,"2008-01-28",3.3,"Golden color with a moderate white head. Lightly toasted malt, dough, corn syrup and some grassy hops in the aromas. Light pale malt sweetness in the start. Mild dough and yeast components. Quite clean. A light toasted malt flavor in the finish and linger. A somewhat unassuming lager, yet you can tell there is some soul in this one. A solid starter brew for a new brewery.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
3199,"2007-12-27",3.5,"On tap at the Milwaukee Ale House.  Poured clear bright golden with a medium cap of off-white head.  The aroma picked up corn, honey, and fresh floral notes.. soft and quite well-executed.  The flavor had dried honey and caramel at the core with low-to-moderate floral bitterness surrounding.. sweet honey and a touch of corn on the short finish.  Light-bodied with decent balance.. medium carbonation.. refreshing.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3199,"2007-12-17",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2008 Second time I had this and rated it. This time I purchased it in bottles at Rays. This is one of the best lagers made in Wisconsin. The folks at Milwaukee Brewing have outdone themselves. The taste was crisp, with fruity tones and a very dry finish.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","kegmeister"
3199,"2007-11-28",3.4,"Cracker-like pale malts and grassily bitter hops are teh foundation for appley esters and grassy hop flavor; some husk astringency show up in the finish.  A solid, hoppy lager.  Described at the brewpub as a ""light lager"".","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
3199,"2007-11-26",3.7,"Pours to a pale/flat looking brassy body with a dense sheet of white foam/frosting head and a nice dense sheet lacing.  The flavor is citrus hops such as mango and peaches up front that morphs into a really toasty pale malt once you swallow.  Muted.  No sharp edges on any of the flavors.  The palate is crisp and clean.  Very, very good for a lager.  The aroma is grass hops and peaches.  Fruity and lightly yeasty.  Id have this again.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
