2103,"2017-05-30",4.1,"Can. Pours a hazy yellow with a lasting 1 cm bubbly head, light, floral only slightly hoppy aroma with a tiny touch of pine - very fresh. Taste is ever so slightly sweet honey intially, rounded out by balanced malts and hops with some light persisting bitterness. Good body - not too thin. Incredibly refreshing, incredibly balanced, and a very welcome break from unremitting hop-bombs which are trendy at the moment. This isnt an old-fashioned tasting beer, though, it is clean and fresh tasting - a great pale ale","","blueruin"

2103,"2016-04-01",3.9,"Can at home in London - picked up at Kris Wines. Pours clear gold, lightly effervescent, with a frothy, pure white head. Great aroma, with lots of tropical fruits, some pineapple, papaya, mango and melon; quite impressed that these characteristics are coming from British hops. Lightly sweet flavour with some grassy bitterness, light dank pine, mango, peach, apricot, faint tangerine. Light in body with assertive carbonation. Quite clean on the finish, lightly drying, with crispy pale malts, some citrus rind, grass, pale grains, more peach. Great stuff overall. Very drinkable.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

2103,"2016-03-19",3.8,"Tasting glass during Moor Tap Takeover @ Gollem from a 330 ml. can. Very hazy orange with a creamy off-white head. Nose is lovely fresh onion, garlic & low hay hop. Taste is a bit too heavy on the yeast for me, light malt, bit sweetish even, onion hop is a bit in the background, hay. Body is a bit yeasty. Loved the nose but I could have used way more onion & garlic in the taste. I admire the brewers desire for drinkability & balances, Moor beers strike me as something that I would pick up from time to time at the supermarket if nicely priced but here, I would like more excess honestly, more fresh onion & garlic hops, that is a personal preferences at odds with the preferences of the brewer.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
