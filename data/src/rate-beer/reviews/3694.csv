Head is average sized, creamy, off-white, with good lacing and is fully lasting. Color dark red/brown. Flavor starts lightly to moderately sweet and slightly acidic, then finishes lightly sweet and moderately bitter. Palate is on the fuller side of medium, creamy, with a soft carbonation. An excellent Irish Ale made even better by being charged with nitrogen.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

Ambrée, col blanc-cassé.
Arôme de vanille laissant un bouquet assez doux et plaisant, rétro moyen de malt pâle, caramel.
Palais est doux gardant ce côté vanillé sans être surfait, léger caramel, Vienna? petite rondeur douce sur la fin tout en restant très léger en bouche. Amertume est plus en retrait. Je ne note cependant pas le côté boisé du chêne.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
3694,"2015-07-12",4.1,"On tap. Deep amber pour with a fairly thick , solid head that sticks around. Somewhat mild, sweet aroma - gingerbread, caramel, vanilla. Taste follows, without the ""mild"" - big vanilla and caramel up front, some holiday spice to follow, and finishes with a little resin and wood. Typical nitro mouthfeel, thick and silky. Like this one a lot, even though Im not a big fan of the style.","Florida, USA","youdictategood"
3694,"2015-04-30",2.6,"I could see this being a love-it-or-hate-it beer. The vanilla is too heavy handed for style. A heavier beer wouldve handed it better. Other notes of caramel, grain and oak.","","ColovianTrader"
3694,"2014-06-16",3.5,"Red with a firm white guinness head. Vanilla in the aroma. Some sweetness on the tongue, but loads of oak and vanilla. Nice for such a small brew","Reykjavik, ICELAND","haukur"
3694,"2014-06-15",3.1,"Almost a medicinal flavor, the vanilla doesn't seem to be working with the red. The white oak barrel is actually pushing the flavor further from where I would want it to be. The body is a bit thin. The color is a rich brownish red, and the carbonation is subtle because it's on the nitro today. Overall, not one of my favorite reds.

3694,"2014-06-07",3.5,"Big, piled, tan nitro head on a medium walnut brown beer. Cookie-ish malt aroma - like ginger snaps minus ginger. Or sweet pumpernickel. Milk chocolate , a little roasty acidity. Medium body, chalky mouthfeel. Woody, dilute chocolate aftertaste. Interesting and a curveball for what I was expecting. On tap, Proof Production, on a nice Saturday afternoon with LuckyDog.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"

3694,"2014-03-18",3.3,"On tap at Engine 15. 
Surprised to see that the Hornswoggled is a red ale; it came without a description and was certainly very bold for style. 
Clear dark brown with a semi-durable head; excellent clarity.
Very mild aroma but moderately strong flavor. Dominated by hazelnut/vanilla.
Mildly bittersweet, with a mildly bitter aftertaste.
Feel: adequate carbonation but overly thin body.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
3694,"2014-02-01",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2014 Nitro... This beer rocks!... Pours clear and copper with a large, creamy, white head that lasts until Ive emptied the glass. The aroma is reminiscent of cream soda that is vanilla-heavy with a toasted oak bonus. Medium to full-bodied and super creamy with pillow-soft carbonation.  Big malt flavor, but not at all cloying. Modest vanilla and caramel sweetness. Finishes off nourishing and bittersweet. Well executed world class beer!. If diggin malt-forward beers is wrong, I dont wanna be right.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

3694,"2013-03-08",3.1,"On tap. Thick head like youd find on a Guinness. Wood brown body with a vanilla extract aroma that is overpowering. Yates like a vanilla cream soda with the frothy root beer float head. Not a typical beer but that may be due to the nitro. Sticky lacing.
