The flavor is a little more complex. There are layers of fruit, funk, malt, earth, barrel, and a light yeastiness. Its really solid.

1139,"2014-06-20",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2014 May 4th, 2013 - Breweries have taken to holding special festivals where they get to release small batches to the public on a small scale. Its a controlled frenzy, but the atmosphere is always light and festive. But Lost Abbeys Anniversary party was on a totally different level. All the beers on tap were rare, delicious and exquisite. This was an afternoon to remember, partly for the sheer volume of alcohol consumed, but more because of the serial miracles each glass offered. I began the day with the Frambose de Amarosa, assured that it was an awesome and sweet place to begin. In the glass it is a beautiful apple red skin color with a slight head, and a heavy carbonation that gives it a polished texture in the tungsten lighting of the tasting room. Raspberry comes off on the nose, with a nice tart, raspberry pie filling scent, and a light and vapory aroma thats impossible to ignore for the conversation around me. The flavor has gobs of strawberry jam, as if dotting my tongue with the thick, goopy sugar, but its still dry and sophisticated. So, perhaps a farmers market jam? The light bitterness of strawberry seeds can be tasted as well, adding on the fresh sweetness of ripe strawberry, the clean, slightly sweet botanical touch of apple skins, and shakes of cinnamon, all space and a quenching carbonation. This is just the start for the day, but its an epic beginning, and sets a high bar for succeeding beers to meet.

September 10th, 2012 - Most of the beers I enjoyed for my birthday came off a line of samplers from the nearby Rock Bottom - La Jolla. But I wanted to end my birthday on a more exceptional note, and that meant turning to the pricier, but always delicious (and adventurous) beers from Lost Abbey. Todays treat (indeed, a desert and a drink wrapped in one) is the exotically named Framboise de Amorosa, proudly proclaimed from a label decorated with images mimicking classic art. It pours with a huge, pillowy meringue textured head, which on closer inspection (and a few more lit light bulbs) blushes with a healthy pink rose hue. The smell reveals berries - baskets and bushels and branches bent by the sheer weight of berries. Theres the mellowness of ripe raspberries, the tanginess of fresh strawberries, a touch of water, the light mineral flavor of mineral water, a shade of light cocoa (blending with the berries to produce the flavor of chocolate dipped fruit) and some white wine qualities too, likely the acidity from some of Lost Abbeys signature oak aging. The flavor, like some of the high notes in the aroma, is at its core, tart and acidic. There was clearly an effort to guard against letting this brew get too sweet, instead relying on more translucent fruit flavors and sour notes to build a beautiful flavor profile. Each sip begins with a fresh bout of watermelon flavors, with an undertone of oak shrieking that outlasts all the other tastes well into the aftertaste. And as it warms, the Framboise de Amorosa takes on a light, lovely wood scent that reminds me of the grounds around Japans famous Ise Shrine, where structures are regularly rebuilt and refinished. Here and there amongst the sips and burps are some sweeter strokes, like raspberry flavors, and some light cream richness and sweetness, but this is definitely a sour and tart beer foremost, or as I write at the end of my notes here, ""An American Cantillon.""","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Very light on the acetic acids for a sour brown, with streaks of oily leather, vegetal notes (again from the raspberries) and a good dose of vanilla. Some lightly sweet brown sugar and toffee notes linger, with more leather, horseblanket and prunes emerging as it warms. Nice and dry, but maybe so intensely sour as to turn off those who arent complete sourheads.Flavor matches the nose quite well, with some lightly sweet pale malt sugars mixing with the dry, somewhat astringent raspberry seed-like flavors. Some sharpness from the acids and the malts are a bit scratchy but it softens and sweetens some on the end, thanks to the acetic acids and light brown malts. Wonderful rasberry flavor, very very authentic and well-attenuated with no syrupiness or residual sweetness. The raspberry flavor reminds me much of Rose de Gambrinus.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Muddy mahogany color.  Big bubbly ring around edge.  Thin patchy wispy/hazy head in center (like the last bit of fog from a dry ice machine).  Sweet dark fruit aroma when swirled, otherwise tart raspberry.  Not quite floral, but something bucolic, light, and airy about this.

Deep chunky red and brown coloured body with a thick, three centimetre tall pink and light brown head.

The current one tastes sharper and fuller but the 2012 has opened up more and feels deeper. Maybe just a bit watery. Big sour bite at the end of the 2013. Very smooth finish for the 2012. Look identical but big differences in taste and body. Both great stuff!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","NikkTwist"

Dark malts are lost in a funky, raspberry aroma.  Barnyard funk and some leather wrap around a tart, vinegar raspberry and an acidic lemon aroma.

A sweet raspberry flavor starts the flavor out, slowly bringing in a sweet caramel malt flavor.  Next the flavor turns bluntly sour, with the sweetness of the raspberries cut in by a sharp lemon sourness.  The raspberry flavor remains, growing tart and acidic, with just a bit of vinegar.

1139,"2012-02-11",4.3,"375 ml bottle from the 1st batch, so with over a year of age on it. This one pours a beautiful cloudy, deep ruby red to plum color with some pinkish tint and topped by a thick, rocky head of light dusty tan colored foam showing great retention. Some pink colored floaties of yeast speckle the foam nicely. The foam slowly settles down to a thin film and leaves thick sheets of lace that cling hard to the glass. The aroma is really nice and bright showing a great balance between funk and fruit with fresh, juicy raspberry tartness  and dry, yeasty, oak barrel notes. There are hints of cherries and blackberries to go with the fresh raspberries and dry yeast. There is ample amount of citric acidity that ties everything together nicely. The flavor follows suit with ample amounts of citric acidity from the berries with plenty of sweetness from the juicy raspberries. The barrel imparts plnety of sharp, woody funk with the right amount of vanilla to smooth out the acidity. Medium bodied with lively carbonation that enhances the dryness and the crisp, refreshing tartness. The finish is lengthy with the tart, juicy raspberries as the star of the show. This is like a hybrid between a great fruit and a belgian lambic, and great tasting to boot. This is another winner from Lost Abbey, and one I need to get a lot more of.

1139,"2012-02-03",4.4,"Amorosa pours a murky brown color with a nice amount of fizzy raspberry colored head.  Sediment litters the glass.  No carbonation issues here.  Lacing throughout the glass as you drink.  As soon as you pop this baby open you know its sour and tart.  I held the bottle away from myself, arms length, and I could still smell the sourness of this beer. When held up to the nose you are welcomed by a nice dose of Raspberries, Tartness, small amount of a yeasty aroma, small amount of oak, and some barnyard aromas.  A tad bit funky.

As I took my first sip, my lips puckered.  This might just be the most tart and sour beer Ive ever tried.  It was hard to get past the first couple of sips.  It didnt taste bad, actually it tasted great but it was just hard.  As you drink it though it becomes easier and easier to drink and more of a pleasure.  The raspberries arent as big in the taste.  They kind of take a back seat here.  Instead the intense tartness rules here.  The funkiness of the beer also comes through more in the taste a long with the oak that it was aged in.  Raspberries linger on the tongue during the aftertaste.  If you are trying to turn someone on to a sour beer, this might not be the best place to start.  While its not the most sour beer Ive had, it was definitely up there in the tartness.  Might scare away some people.

Rating #1800 : When I think of excellent sours this is going to come to mind for the next few months. Once again Lost Abbey hits a grand slam with the perfect balance of sourness and depth. Just thinking about it makes me want to open a bottle of Madame Rose or something else in the cellar to revisit the experience.

Aroma / Appearance - One of the deepest red bodies I have ever seen this is a very opaque beer.  Like raspberry jam in liquid form it radiates warmth. Sharp raspberry jam on white toast is blunt and to the point. However it does such a good job that there is no reason for it to be much more complex; the intensity is enough to keep ones attention for a very long time.

Flavor / Palate - The sourness is immediate and intense. Melting the tongue it seeps into every corner of the mouth. Like drinking pure raspberry puree this takes me back to the best of the true lambics. Even after a few minutes the taste still lingers as if it had just hit the palate. Finally after a while a chocolate feel wraps itself around the back of the throat with a velvety texture. This was worth every penny although it is hardly a daily drinker at $15+. I cant wait for the next Port sour.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1139,"2011-06-03",4.3,"Bottle from South Bay Drugs: Special thanks to Joey for saving me a bottle. First off, I have a question that needs to be answered. What is the deal with small bottles from Lost Abbey that explode the beer all over once its uncorked. My Angels Share did the same thing which made me stop buying that particular beer because I knew half of it would end up on the floor. I have to admit this bottle was the worse I have ever experienced in my life. It was as if I dropped Mentos into a 2 Liter of Coca-Cola. Im talking violent volcanic explosion all over my sink and floor while only half of the bottle am I able to salvage into my pint glass. 

Now, let me speak about the beer even though I am really ticked off that I can only enjoy a little less than half of my bottle as I unwillingly shared the rest of it with my sink and floor. Liquid is a glowing pinkish read hue with chunks of sediment seen scattered in the frothy layer of head and throughout the beer to the point it is opaque with junk. The aroma is relieving and delightful and has started to sooth my anger and frustration towards Lost Abbey brewing by the sweet scents of raspberries that smell red, juicy and plump. There is also a scent of sour Belgian yeast that compliments the fruit quite nicely. The flavor is tart with ripened cranberry or raspberry and also has a sour kick of green apple as well. It almost taste as if juice concentrate was added to the beer, but Ill take it as it is no matter how it was brewed. Also, minor background of luscious red wine and freshly picked unripe grape.

This is a substantial tasting ale that confuses the taste buds in a pleasant experience, but I am still upset of how much of this beer spilled over immediately after I popped the cork. This will cost points from being awarded to the overall score.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

Muddy brown with red highlights, decent tan head. Nose of bright and sugary raspberry jam -- intense. But theres nothing sweet about the flavor. Rather, a wickedly tart (think straight lemon juice, but then amped up further.) Not much funk, plenty of power, unripe raspberry. Something I associate with oud bruin (what is that flavor??) underneath it all but much more buried than in the sweeter e.g. Duchess.

1139,"2010-12-02",4.0,"Thank you dearly, Dstructo. Our bottle was muy amorosa, a gusher. Lost half the small bottle :( As a result of the overly eager beer, the pour is frightfully ugly. Its so muddy it looks like tomato juice only with the color of blueberry juice, a dirty bruised red. The aroma makes up for it, though. First whiff is a bowl of raspberries. Nice! Further inspection reveals some phenols, but oddly they dont get in the way. Not pulling a lot of funk from the aromas but that all changes at first sip when the tartness really comes through. The mouthfeel is thick and thin at the same time, with the thickness coming from yeast. Belying the way the bottle popped, only a mild bit of carbonation is here. Fairly acidic brew, certainly has some of the the Flemish acetic overtones and certainly fun barrel bugs but not necessarily Brett. Complexity is added by a straightforward load of musty raspberries and the mellowing subtle sweetness of the malt. Very enjoyable overall.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
1139,"2010-12-01",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2012 Big thanks to bmanning for this bottle.

A: Pours a moderate amber with some definitely red highlights. A bit disappointing compared with the nose and flavor; given these, I would expect a big, bright pink-red body a la the Cantillon Lou Pepe Kriek and Framboise.

S: More than makes up for the ""lacking"" appearance with incredible notes of fresh, ripe raspberry and a nearly-bracing sourness level. Mostly straight sourness, with a bit of vinegar, funk, and sweetness thrown in.

T: Absolutely incredible. This is perhaps the best fruit-containing sour beer that Ive ever had, certainly above Blabaer and up with my all-time favorite, Lou Pepe Kriek. Nice tart notes of raspberry, hints of oak, funk, and a good amount of residual sweetness come up alongside the puckering sour characteristics.

M: Sublime. Incredibly sour, but the dichotomy created by the tart and sweet aspects of the raspberries really works well to bring a complex, cohesive whole.

D: I never wanted it to end. Simple as that. Thank you, Lost Abbey.

Pours into the glass and looks like melted crayon wax, hard to believe its a beer. Nose is deep and juicy ripe raspberries, hints of the cable car cultures that this was apparently aged on.

1139,"2010-09-02",3.8,"375ml bottle, enjoyed during the JCB family reunion in SF. Rock on! Faintly cloudy reddish-brown pour, with a thin scrim of bubbles. Lovely nose, combining extremely fresh berry with a tart, faintly oaky bruin aroma that almost cups the fresh fruit. Moderate carbonation and a hint of slickness as it lingers on the tongue, before a medium dry finish that has just the right touch of acidity. In some ways, I want more of the oud bruin to come through; thatll likely happen with age. Nice stuff.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Flat on the tongue is all raspberry, around the sides is a wild sour fest.  Both are good, hell, wildly unique even, but very different depending on where you let it go to be tasted.

1139,"2010-08-13",4.4,"Bottle generously shared by gorditoabd.  Pours a murky and muddy looking brown with a slightly pinkish hue.  Head is surprisingly moderate... I was warned that this might gush, but no such unfortune was had here.  Aromas are pretty standard... lots of sour and a little raspberry (which becomes much more pronounced on a deep inhale).  Flavor is wildly heavy with raspberry...  for about one second before it gives way to a sour blast and then finishes with a raspberry seed finish that leaves a lingering sour and fruit presence on the palate.  This is really interesting stuff... Depending on how it slides across the palate it is either a raspberry joyfest or a sour puckering punch in the face.  As far as complexity has it... this is amazing.  As far as a decent incorporation of raspberry goes... outstanding.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"
1139,"2010-08-13",3.7,"Veiled pinkish red hue. If its white foam remains quite shy, its aroma is explosive, bursting with whole raspberries, seemingly fresh and most authentic. A dash of funk complement it, but its really as much about the fruit than a New Glarus can be. Gorgeous perfume, so attractive in fact that it is just shocking how acidic it is in mouth. Very, very intense, playing on many acid registries at the same time, feeling highly citric, acetic all the while showcasing whats left of the raspberries (and sugar is not part of whats left). So you have a dry, intensely sour and tannic ale whose finish lasts for minutes. As subtle as a punch in the face and frankly too intense for the beer drinker that I am today. You certainly cant compliment it on drinkability, but it smells so good that youd very much like to try it again and again.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1139,"2010-08-13",4.1,"Bottle at RBSG, courtesy of Drewbeerme, iirc. This was not a gushing bottle at all. Subtle hiss of the cork. Pours a ruddy red-brown with a pink head. Nose is full of raspberry jam, acid, a bit of vinegar. Very nice nose. On taste, very well balanced with plenty of sweetness still remaining to play kindly with the robust raspberry notes. Some cocoa in the background before the acidity takes over. Pretty fantastic stuff.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
1139,"2010-08-11",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
This Sour Ales enthralling raspberry aroma gives way to an intense and mouth-puckering union of sour bacteria, musty yeast and fruity sourness. If you love Cantillon and Hanssens products for their funky and brash nature, you will adore this.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the cloudy dark red.
-Carbonation is initially expansive, but the flavors are so bold that the intensity makes you drink slowly, thus letting the beer breathe and the carbonation soften.
-The raspberry perfume is just wonderful. You can even imagine yourself biting on some of its seeds.
-This is beautifully authentic throughout and, although it may not be as refined as some of Russian Rivers own Sour Ales, it has to be lauded as one of the most impressive brews of this type made in the USA.

1139,"2010-06-25",3.3,"From a 375mL Bottle.  Pours a mostly cloudy, ruddy brown colored body with a tall head of fizzy, pink-hued foam.  Relatively clean pour after chilling the bottle down to 33F, with most of the fruit pectin visibly left in the bottom 20% of the bottle.  Moderate raspberry fruit aroma, with some earthy/seedy/leafy qualities.  A bold acidity is also present in the nose, both tart lactic and sour acetic qualities.  Some cherry-skin like brett funkiness and dark, raisiny caramel malt sweetness as well.  Light bodied, heavily carbonated mouthfeel with a dry, acidic finish.  The fruit character comes across boldy enough at first, although I found the combination of a seedy plant-like fruit flavor and bold acidity overwhelmed the ""brightness"" of the fruit in the end.  After the first few sips, my initial impression was that the acidity was balanced more toward a complex lactic, almost lambic-like sourness, sharpened by a restrained acetic quality.  However, the deeper I got into my glass, the more overwhelming the acetic qualities became, shifting the focus from big, bright, dry fruit onto a lingering, acetone driven impression of sweetness.  The light raisin malt flavors contributed a pleasant almost vinous like complexity in the background of the fruit and acid.  Dry finish, although the lingering acetic character imparts the sensation of a lingering sweetness.  Overall, a pretty good first attempt at this concept - Id eagerly look forward to trying subsequent batches.  Ultimately, the only disappointment was this beer left me desiring a brighter, more intense fruit flavor. After tasting the pectin left in the bottom of the bottle, my impression is that the seedy, plant-like fruit flavor could be related to the sheer amount of fruit matter that made it into the bottle, and less of the acetic qualities would also help keep my focus on the fruit.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

1139,"2010-06-22",4.1,"Well, a friend brought a bottle of this to the Brick Store and the word gusher doesnt do justice to what I witnessed.  Based on this, I opened my bottle outside just in case.  Thank God I did because once the cork popped 3/4 of the bottle proceeded to stream out of the bottle in roughly 3 seconds.  So this review is from the remaining 3oz....

The body is a murky reddish amber with lots of little floaties underneath a light pink head which leaves delicate lacing.

The aroma is awesome and really reminds me of NG Raspberry Tart in that its crazy sweet - fresh raspberries dipped in sugar.  Only a very light sourness complementing the sugary sweetness.

The taste has a much more prevalent sourness up front and it is far less sugary sweet than the aroma.  There is some raspberry flavor but more straight raspberries without the heavy sugar presence.

The mouthfeel is medium to full for the style with lots of carbonation (needless to say).  Dry sour finish.

This is a fantastic beer from Lost Abbey though they seemingly still have some sort of carbonation issue as Ive never lost this much beer in a gusher.  However, unlike with the flatter beers from last year, the carbonation doesnt really take away from the quality of this beer.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

1139,"2010-05-28",4.4,"Fresh 375ml.  Prepared for a gusher, I wisely pointed the bottle away from me as I unwound the cage.  Good thing I did, as the cork shot off like a rocket before I got to the final twist.  Thankfully, there was no gush, as it seemed more the fault of an improperly positioned cork than anything else. Once poured, the beer is exceedingly beautiful.  A deep ruby to plum colored body looks dense and cloudy, while an impossibly thick head of rocky, dusty rose foam sits omnipresent at the head. Garnet tinted yeast floaties pepper the foam like mini chocolate chips in ice cream, and they join the thick, broken sheets of lacing in drying hard to the glass.  The nose strikes excellent balance between funky and fruity, booming with juicy raspberry tartness and ample yeasty, dry, woody barrel notes.  There are hints of cherries, blackberries, and other sweet-tart fruits mixed in, though things are primarily driven by raspberries and the sharp, dusty yeast. Citric acidity brings everything into acute focus, completing the delectable aroma.  Flavors are similarly structured, again hitting the tongue with serious, acidic berry tartness, yet sufficiently juicy and fruit forward.  The barrel imparts a sharp, woody funk without being overly loaded with vanilla.  Each sip strips the palate down and builds it right back up, lively carbonation and crisp, refreshing acidity doing their respective jobs well.  All too quickly, my glass is empty.  This stuff is like a hybrid of New Glarus classic Raspberry Tart and an old world Belgian framboise lambic, and that, to me, is a beautiful thing. Lost Abbey has a real winner on their hands.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

1139,"2010-05-17",4.5,"It was very difficult to remove the cork from this beer but when I finally pried it loose it let out an explosive pop. Pours a dark, muddy mahogany/ruby color that is so dark it is almost chestnut brown with a two finger frothy pinkish beige head. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that leaves spots of lacing behind. Completely opaque with chunks of yeast floating behind. I left a few ounces in the bottom of the bottle but there are still some pretty large sized yeast chunks in there.

Funky aroma with a very prominent luscious, uber-fresh berry presence. There are also some other dark fruit notes but predominantly raspberry. Nice amount of earthy, tart barnyard funk in the nose with hints of cobweb, horseblanket and bandaid. Also, some earthy oak picked up from the barrel. The aroma of this beer is very similar to a Belgian Lambic, probably the closest Ive encountered in an American Wild Ale. The berries are very forward but with some age the nose on this beer could develop into something ridiculous.

Intensely tart, mouth-puckering mouthfeel with lots of earthy and acidic funk balanced out by a sweet dark raspberry fruit flavor. As in the aroma, there is a very strong funky sour tartness with a slight lactic presence and decent amount of earthy oak from the barrel aging. This beer is still young so the raspberries are prominent adding a sweet yet still tart balance and another level of complexity. Soft carbonation throughout as well as a slight syrupy texture adds some thickness/fullness to the body but the bone dry, intensely puckering finish leaves me salivating for another sip. Only slightly acidic and extremely quaffable. Again, this beer is young so the fruit is still prominent but with some age this is going to develop into a monster.

1139,"2010-05-13",3.3,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2010 Sampled September 2010
Well this was one of my freely sent, unsolicited, replacement bottles based on a previously explosive, encountered experience with a couple bottles of this brew.  I have high hopes for this one.  A overly careful, even paranoid extraction of the cork and cage yields no surprises and almost three-fingers of lightly burgundy tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is a dark, concentrated red color that shows a hazed, bright red color and a ton of streaming bubbles from the carbonation when  held up to the light.  The aroma is hugely dominated by raspberry aromatics, deeply fruity, almost extract like in its intensity, but definitely real raspberries; seeds, skin and pulp all mixed together, but all raspberry, all the time.

Very frothy and foamy as it rolls across the tongue; it is a bit overly carbonated, but some vigorous swirling gets rid of this.  This is on the dry side, especially given how sweet and fruity the nose smells.  The finish has a definite spiciness to it, which seems to be contributed by some acetic acidity as well as from the raspberries themselves.  A substantial oak character also contributes to the spiciness in the finish, but also contributes a teeth sticking tannic character, and some woody fresh cut plank character; this last is quite noticeable at times.  The dominant acid flavors here are the raspberry acidity and a touch of acetic acidity, but I am willing to bet that the lactic acid makes up the largest percentage of the acid here.  The raspberries as they have fermented have contributed a note that is a little like a light, fruity, though over-oaked, red wine.    The base beer is fairly subtle here, the acidity is the most noticeable part and there might be a hint of toasty malt character buried in here somewhere, but really the oak and the raspberry flavors are the most dominant notes.

This is definitely a much better, even less lively experience than my previous encounters with this beer.  The aroma is cleaner than it was previously, but now seems a bit simplistic in its raspberry focus.  Even the flavor is bit simplistic, though not nearly as much as the aroma; the flavor has a bit too much oak to it, which messes with the palate and the aroma just a bit too much.
Update Pending: great customer service has promised replacement bottles for the two bum-ones I got
6/1/5/1/8 = 2.1
Warning, this is a rating based on two bottles, both the same.  Hopefully one day Ill get to try something better controlled during the brewing process; $30 bucks down the drain, let you be warned.

Well, what a completely fucking joke.  I was ready for it, but in an instant foam geysers out of the bottle leaving me less than a 1/3rd of the bottle, and I end up with maybe 3 oz of beer in my glass.  The rest ended up all over my hanging cabinet and on the counter.  The head is a dirty mix of brown and pink hues with lots of lacing and a chunky, yeast laden structure.  Murkier and nastier than shit colored b/c of the excessive carbonation that kicked up the sediment.  The aroma smells of raspberries, lactic acid, a hint of acetic acid, perhaps an earthy yeast note.  

Acidic, a mix of lactic and acetic as well as a really tannic, astringent texture that is a mix of yeast chunks and oak.  Really dirty and murky flavored.  Some toasted malt character supports the sourness and the faint, dried out, yet still seed-like raspberry character.  Really yeasty and murky tasting due to the sediment, it even is chunky with specs of sediment marring the texture.  Despite being quite dry, the raspberry character comes through pretty well; the lack of sweetness definitely keeps the raspberry flavor from being overwhelming; this was likely bottled with a noticeable sweetness (at least given the explosive, excessive carbonation).

What a monumental disappointment; in the end the aroma, appearance, texture, and flavor were all majorly negatively impacted by the horrible bottle conditioning.  I am definitely peeved that I  lost 80% of this $15 dollar beer.  I think I would have actually enjoyed this if it had been properly bottle-conditioned.  How this ended up this way I dont even want to know, but I really, really hope I get to try a decent sample of this some day.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

There is a depth behind the sweet raspberry that brings the drinker into the cellar of an old farmhouse.  It pours a  partially cloudy mahogany red with a thick lasting pinkish head.  Sourness is balanced  with the tartness from the fruit.  Ever so slight is the malt cowering in the background.  Refreshingly dry with a bright carbonation which lends a subtle carbonic acidity that makes this beer absolutely a delight.  It is so much more than I had hoped it would be.  I am glad to have 2 more bottles to grope for as I fondle my way through my house cellar","Sonoma, California, USA","bumpskier"
1139,"2010-05-10",4.1,"375mL shared with SpencerDB. Not a gusher! Hurray! Poured into champagne flutes. Cork pops with good, powerful carbonation. FdA pours a super cloudy deep pink that almost creates a muddy mahogany color. Very thin, fizzy, white head. Looks pretty good. Aroma is a little balsamic, fresh raspberries, pithy/seedy raspberry preserves, big sour funk, oak, Cantillon Lou Pepe complexities, Flander red wild notes. Very rich and complex nose. Taste is an insane sour: massive lactic character. Some saltwalter, sour fruits, leather, oak, balsamic. Excellent coating mouthfeel. Really a nice treat. I think I was a bit disappointed because I wanted a true oud bruin base beer for this. Instead, this is a spot on framboise lambic base.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1139,"2010-05-09",4.0,"On tap, brewery.  Nose is mild, touch acidic fruit with a hint of metal.  Flavor punches with tart cherry, pink lemonade, cranberry and sweet fruit punch.  Woody notes complement nicely.  Great intense flavors, reminds me of a more tart version of NGs raspberry tart.  Finish moves effortlessly into hightened acetic and lactic acid. Long tart fruit finish.  Very satisfying, the depth of fruit-tinged flavor through the middle is amazing.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

Cork was damn near impossible to remove, but a very loud POP made me smile. I didnt feel like another Flat Abbey disappoint. Pours a nice reddish brown with a nice pinkish tan head. Aroma is quite good, with a nice earthy, leathery foundation to be found underneath the tart raspberries. Flavor isnt quite as impressive with some astringent flavors coming through. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with enough carbonation to clear the palate. Not bad at all.","California, USA","KAME"

1139,"2010-05-08",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2010 375ml, corked & caged bottle, from south bay. opened cold, but not too cold, and this one was no gusher. poured perfectly into a couple of tulips to split with LJ. pours a spectacular hazy, dark, reddish-purple with a thick, bubbly, rose-pink head that lasted through the entire experience. aroma is fantastic with very tart red raspberries, crushed berry seeds, vinegar, lemon rind, and light barrel funk initially that develops more complexity as the beer warms with sweeter aromas of oak, vanilla, floral soap, and wet, grassy, barnyard notes. flavor is absolutely wonderful as well with huge, ripe, freshly picked, SOUR raspberries paired with red wine vinegar and lemon pulp that pucker the mouth initially but are quickly balanced by sweet caramel cake, vanilla, and woody oak. i loved the way this beer truly opened up as it warmed slightly and while it remained sadistically sour it became more complex and balanced. palate is medium bodied, bright, crisp, and wickedly tart without being too dry and is nicely carbonated with a lingering, tart/sweet raspberry/oak finish. overall, another world class sour from lost abbey and im damn glad to have another bottle sitting in the cellar.","Norfolk, Virginia, USA","ksurkin"

1139,"2010-05-04",4.2,"2nd bottle.  Ruby blood red and much darker than the 1st.  High carbonation.  Thin raspberry and sour aroma.  First bottle seemed a bit too thin on the tart flavor; the sour flavors on this one taste more integrated to the beer (different barrels?).  Im completely won over by the layers of tart, sour, sugar, fruit, and slight vinegar funk.  Deep sour that actually burns the back of your throat and it is quite enjoyable.  I better pick up a few more of these if theyre available.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"
1139,"2010-05-04",4.1,"Bottle shared by badnewsbeers. Murky, pulpy red body with a thick pink to cream head. This bottle was a gusher, so we had to recover some of its contents from the bowl we opened it in. Wonderful, sweet raspberry nose, grassy and soapy, somewhat tart but not too sour. The huge sourness in the body took me off guard after experiencing the sweet aroma. The sip is puckering sourness, with hints of brie cheese rind and notes of raspberry and wet grass. Very well done!","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
1139,"2010-05-03",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 30, 2011 Draught. Clear, bright rosy red with a fine, light pink head. Quite a beautiful, sensual beer.  Tart, fresh raspberries are immediately apparent on the nose along with bright lacto fermentation and barrel-aged characteristics. The flavor of the raspberries is preserved very well and comes across quite fresh in the beer. There is a lovely faint toasted malt lift  in the finish just as the sourness fades.  The multi-layered flavor profile delivers a great impression of depth. This leads into a a superbly balanced body that conveys both strength and delicacy. Not sweet, not dry, this beer strikes the perfect balance between fruitiness and sour complexity.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"
1139,"2010-05-03",4.2,"12.7oz bottle, from Sinners membership. Pours a deep, murky, pulpy, dark-burgundy color (hugely dense, pulpy raspberry juice); hazy; significant, light-tan to off-pink head: textured, foamy, beautifully retained, with lasting lacing; a flawless pour on this. Having cracked a much colder bottle of this a week ago, theres sort of a tradeoff in temperature here: the warmer bottles are more likely to gush, but chilling them down heavily really affects some of the aromatic qualities and presence in the mouth. This bottle has simply an amazing bright, pulpy, pitty, and slightly tart red-raspberry character first and foremost: highly reminiscent of (I was going to say ""something like NG Raspberry Tart"", but there really is nothing else like that beer...) NG Raspberry Tart!: hugely aromatic, luscious, just tarted up a bit more here; no cloying sweetness, the bruin character underneath is quiet compared to the fruit; some touches of vanilla and oakiness; this just smells fantastic... Medium body; lively carbonation, definitely a highly effervescent brew, but doesnt come across as at all fizzy; no obvious alcohol at moderate temps; following the aroma, there as just a ton of red raspberries in this beer: lush, pitty, pulpy, ripe, lightly tannic, moderately tart; theres a citrusy / lemony soured element present as well; moderate to moderately-high levels of acidity; unlike beers like the Sinners 08 and Russian River Consecration, while there are significant tannins present in this beer, the presentation overall still opens up: the tartness, acidity, and astringency (quite low) are tempered, and some of that soft, toasty, vanilla-tinged oak can still be enjoyed amidst all the tart fruit goodness; a pretty excellent beer, all told, and despite the fact that Im evidently totally incapable of writing a review tonight without ten million linked adjectives. Lasting finish of raspberry seeds, tart citrus, and very modest tannins.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
1139,"2010-05-03",3.7,"On tap.  Poured a muddled reddish-brown color with a thin, pink hued head that faded to a ring.  Aroma of bright, fresh raspberry flesh with light hints of funky yeast and a fresh woody character.  Tart, crisp entry leads into a fresh raspberry flavor with some funky, chewy yeast that seemed to muddle the flavor some before giving way to a moderately dry woodiness that lingered with some sweet raspberry seediness.  Moderate carbonation and chewy mouth feel (which could probably be contributed in part by the yeast).  Overall, the freshness and richness of the raspberries was pretty refreshing, but the flavor seemed somewhat muddled and hazy.  I guess I need to try it again.","Aurora, Colorado, USA","BlackForestCO"

In short: A ton of raspberries, strong tartness, acidic bite, moderate funk, fantastic brew
How: Tap at Extreme Beer Fest 2010.  Multiple samples
The look: Murky red body topped by a small pink head
In long: Nose is intensely raspberry and some funky acidic notes.  Taste is just that, a ton of raspberries and funky acidic notes.  I couldnt help it but to compare this beer to the wonderful New Glarus Raspberry Tart.  This Framboise di Amarosa was like taking the Raspberry Tart and putting it through Jolly Pumpkin barrels or something like that to give it a funky acidic edge.  Less intense on the raspberries than the Raspberry Tart but a lot more tart and sharp.  Could also be compared to a Lou Pepe Framboise although obviously less lambic funky.  A wicked beer.  They only had one keg of this beer at EBF and the beer was not officially listed.  Then one person told one person who told two persons who told 4 persons, etc.  And before you knew it we were all rushing to get multiple samples of this amazing beer.

Theres huge Raspberry note backed by a clean lactic sourness. Its fresh and natural smelling, no artificial fruit here. It reminds me of making raspberry jam. The flavor is almost harshly tart and lactic sour, which I enjoy but probably isnt for everyone. The mouthfeel seems thick but I could be imagining that. The beer is fairly palette wrecking, pleasingly so at first but it wore on me. The lactic tart raspberry was strong enough to make me almost lose the flavor by the end of my small glass.

1139,"2010-02-28",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2010 cloudy ruby red, the keg was mixed and sloshed for sure.  bright and vibrant seedy/woody fresh raspberry nose.  rich and frothy, if a little too yeasty, mucky and chewy.  oak is strong as expected from lost abbey, but the heavy fruit tends to balance it more than in their other sours.  the first half of the glass is better than the second, which actually *is* typical of their sours.  still, hard to not enjoy this one.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1139,"2010-02-28",3.8,"Boulder Sourfest 10 - along with the Veritas 007, this was probably one of the more palate-crushing at the fest - strong acidity and full carbonation really make this tough on the tongue - kind of briny and earthy up front, followed by tart, whole raspberry flavor (skin, seeds, etc.) - moderate funk toward the back, as the acidity quiets down a bit - I like it, but only in small doses.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
1139,"2010-02-28",3.8,"Draught at Sour Fest. Murky redish brown with thin redish head. Aroma of raspberries and funk sweetness. Taste is wild sour raspberry that makes mouth salivate. Palate is very carbonated and light bodied. I like how the raspberries do not make it too sweet.","Denver, Colorado, USA","potbeerjob"
1139,"2010-02-24",4.6,"[Draft @ Monks] Murky red color with a small, white head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of raspberries, red wine vinegar, vanilla oak, and wild yeast.  Taste of raspberries, oak tannins, earthy yeast, pits, and a tart finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
1139,"2010-02-23",4.8,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2010 Draft at Monks for the Lost Abbey dinner with Tomme Arthur. This batch was double fruited with raspberries, thus producing a thicker, tarter brew. Pours straight opaque maroon with insane sedimentation throughout. Aroma of raspberries, yeast, malt, soft grapes and vanilla, lavender, and a trace of hops. Body is full, thick, and smoothie-like. Very chunky, tart palate. Outstanding sour ale. Ill probably never be able to try this again, so it was great to try it.

Second Rating. Bottle. 12 oz. Split with James. Pours a deep, mahogany chestnut hazed amber with a thin, lacy, tightly-bubbled tan head. Aroma of pureed raspberries, fresh strawberries, sour lemon, dark grapes, tart black cherries, slight vanilla, lavender, and subtle funky tones. Medium bodied with a hugely carbonated, chunky, lip-puckeringly sour palate. Finishes with a crazy fizz burn from the carbonation and a tight sting from the pure raspberry. This beer is an outstanding celebration of sour and sweet and the wonder of freshly grown fruit. Outstanding.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","patrickfannon"
1139,"2010-02-23",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2016 Draft at monks; Tomme came over and cheered with us on this one - must be good? Pours a thick, reddish body with minimal spotty white lace & froth. Aroma is strong raspberries. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy thick, full-bodied; rich in texture - almost like jelly. Flavors sprawl out across the palate in an explosion of tart, puckering fruit flavor. Notes of seedy raspberry, blackberry jam, strong acidity and a noticeable mouth puckering tart character lasting on the palate afterwards.  Paired excellently with a delicious stuffed quail.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
1139,"2010-02-22",4.4,"Tap at EBF 2010!  Wow- probably the best beer of the fest for me.  Pours a nice jammy murky deep red with violet purple tints- no head but a light prickly carbonation.  Aroma is very fruity, jammy, funk, big sour and lactic notes, barnyard funk, but mostly heavy fruit jam- on the line of Raspberry tart but not as sweet or juicy- this was more lambic-like, with some seedy notes, pits and mineral- similar to a fresh Lou Pepe framboise, with a touch less funk, but even more big fruit.  Flavor is intense with tons of raspberries, very jam-like, although not sweet at all, nor is it juicy, after the fruit and funk come tons of mineral, pits, seeds, and a shit-ton of acidity to balance a massive fruit bomb.  Funk and acid all around the big fruitiness in the end- not chemically, no off funkiness, no off fusels or phenols, not overly funked out- just nicely sour and very intense.  Even with a massive heartburn from the night before, I had to force down many samples because it just tasted so damn good.  My stomach hated me however.  This was big and intense but in a very good way!","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
1139,"2010-02-16",4.2,"On tap at the Grand Cru release.  They ran out pretty fast.  Pour is a dark, very hazy, reddish brown; nice pink head.  Funky malt, raspberries, barnyard, and nice sour kick.  This beer overpowers the red poppy by far.  Not subtle, but very good and complex.  I loved it.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
1139,"2010-02-14",3.7,"Double Barreled version, Im guessing a different version than the bottled version.  This was certainly interesting and tasty, but a little muddled at this point.  Pours cloudy red with a pink head.  Nose has a huge kick of razz.  Taste certainly has nice tart sour notes, but its some what brackish and thick right now, I get the feel of more than the berry, like some stem and something else, but itsnt bad by any means.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
1139,"2010-02-14",4.3,"On tap at Lost Abbey for the Angels Share Grand Cru / Red Poppy release.  The person who entered this has the name incorrect -- it was actually called Framboise di Amorosa.  Pours a muddy red-pink-purple-brown (no, Im not color blind) with a thick pink head.  Funk/brett is strong in the aroma along with a more mellow raspberry smell.  Flavor is initially very tart but not an overwhelming kind of acidic sourness -- it was actually very pleasant despite being so tart.  The tart gives way to a bit of mild sweetness.  Raspberry and other fruit flavors (Kool-Aid too) abound and there is a bit of funk and lactic sourness as well.  The flavors are very nicely balanced.  Hope this becomes a regular brew at Lost Abbey","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"
1139,"2010-02-14",4.6,"On tap at Lost Abbeys Grand Cru event. A murky dark purple pour with a small pink head. The aroma is tart and funky with raspberries and some horseblanket brett. The taste is overtly sour with sour red raspberries, black raspberries and tannins from the seeds of those berries. The palate is silky smooth and full with lively carbonation. The finish was impossibly long with lingering tart raspberries. Overall: The taste of these raspberries was so authentic that I kept thinking that I was biting into the seeds of the fruit. This sour is off the hook, I hope someday that they bottle it. WELL done LA crew.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"
