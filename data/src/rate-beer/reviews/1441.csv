1441,"2014-05-25",4.2,"Transfer from BA review on 3-26 -12 - 
Poured from bottle into pint glass
 
Appearance  Pours a deep brown color with a slight reddish hue. Upon pouring there is a giant off white head. The head is composed of big bubbles, but yet has quite a persistence and lasts for some time. Over time it fades and leaves some very nice lacing.

Smell  The aroma is big in malt and sweetness. The malt is mainly roasty in nature with nice biscuity aromas mixed in. For the sweetness, it is composed largely of a toffee aroma with some lighter dark fruit aromas mixed in.

Taste  A heavy sweet malt favor meets the tongue. It is a bit of roasted malt with some sweet cherry bread. Toward the middle the fruit flavors of some cherry and even a little citrus work their way in mixing well with the nice roasty malt flavor. These flavors persist to the end and finish off the taste by mixing with a light boozy flavor that leaves a very nice warming sweet flavor in the mouth.

Mouthfeel The body of this beer is quite creamy and thick. You can almost chew this one. The carbonation level is just below average and helps to accentuate the nice thick, chewy, creamy body. Mixing the wonderful body and nice carbonation level with the warming feeling that the alcohol brings it makes for an overall very enjoyable mouthfeel.

Overall  This was a nice brew. A nice thick body with some strong sweeter flavors. A very nice sipper with great flavors and a nice feel.","","Darkmagus82"
1441,"2013-10-20",3.4,"Appearance:
Plum and mahogany with cherry wood highlights. A boisterous tan head fades in rocky clumps and swirls just as foamy and rocky.

Nose:
Cocoa powder, chocolate crisps, and graham crackers. Date and raisin pumpernickel bread. Boozy chewy maraschino cherries in the middle with a tickle of spicy heat in the back. Liquor cherry cordials.

Palate:
Creamy and chewy with pulped and smashed cherries. Tannic apple and plum skins in the finish makes the tongue tingle. Spicy heat in the breath  boozed cherry cordials. Lips are sticky. Candied apples and plums. Sweet smoky chocolate along the sides. Skor bars smoldering over a fire. Dry rustic finish.

Final Thoughts:
With all the spicy boozy rustic notes, I was thinking more of a barrel-aged Alt-bierif that is even possible. There was even a hint of Samichlaus in there. Truly unique and truly delicious.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

A - Pours clear and dark amber in color. 1 finger of tan head.

S - Graham cracker sweetness, yeasty pie dough, dates, caramel covered nuts.

T - Figs, dates, and raisins soaked in alcohol, theres a good amount of spiciness as well. Thin molasses and nutty caramel malts ride the middle of the fruit. Finishes with spicy alcohol bite.

M - Medium body, good carbonation, slick feel, mellow, mellow warmth.

Great job by the home brewer. This one has a very nice nose on it. A good drinker too but not as put together as the aroma. I did like the fruit esters. Well done.

1441,"2013-04-30",3.7,"Rich deep brown coloured body with a hint of toffee, ruby and amber tints and a thinnish tan head. Aroma of alcohol, sugars, caramel, yeast, graham crackers and a bit of pit fruit - nice. Medium to Full-bodied; Strong toasted malt flavour up front with a big metallic bitterness, some caramel, a little yeast and a strong alcohol warmth at the end. Aftertaste shows a lot of complexity with pit fruits, caramel, toasted malt and a bit of spices at the end, but perhaps a bit too much depth and pungency with metal showing through. Overall, a good and relatively complex beer with a solid flavour profile and a good representation of the style.

The beer is copper colored with amber / ruby highlights and a half inch of tan head. The aroma offers candy, sugar, malt - smells sweet. The flavor brings sweet malt, candied fruit, and booze. A bit hot and sweet for my tastes, but I suppose the style calls for this, at least to a certain degree. Some plum and raisin characteristics emerge more as the beer is allowed to warm. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. Overall, this was pretty good.

1441,"2012-06-23",3.5,"Picked up the Longshot series from BevMo in Mission Valley, San Diego, Calif. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. About 2 ½ fingers of head. Color was a malty reddish brown. Heavy tan lacing on the top that had average retention. 

Lots of different flavors on the nose that came together nicely at the end. Got the malts up front that reminded me a bit of a Rogue Dead Ale or a more wintery beer. Newcastle comes to mind quickly. Toffee, caramel, light chocolate and some candy. 

The taste was a bit different than the smell and what I was expecting. Basically an even thicker, maltier version of the smell. Malty is the theme of this beer. Toffee, caramel, light chocolate, light coffee and a bit of roasty nuts. 

Medium-to-full body. Creamy, sticky texture. Below average carbonation. Dirty, grimy, smooth finish. 

Good first beer for me from this six-pack (two beers each of different kinds). Like I said earlier, malts dominates this beer. Very strong and I already feel it about ¾ of the way down through a pint.","","User134089"

1441,"2012-06-06",3.5,"I thought this was pretty good. I found it necessary to keep reminding myself, ""this is an alt, this is an alt"". On that level, its very good--compared to most alts, which usually bore to tears with a simple bread/caramel malt thing. The alcohol is big here, but that is reasonably well restrained. What was weird about it, as I alluded to already, is that with its dark brown body, moderately vibrant carbonation, and rich malty notes, my brain told me that the beer in my glass is a Belgian dubbel. But if you think that way, it will disappoint, because the fruitiness is too subtle, the sweetness isnt anything like a candi sugar sweetness, and it lacks some of the depth in the malts. Its a big German alt, and on its own terms its quite good. Bottle.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

It is a slow sipper w/ the malt profile of an alt w/ complex earthy and nutty tones .I might normally complain this is too sweet but the sweetness does at least work well w/ the heavy fruity and cherry notes and kind of lends a sherry-like quality.

It is maple syrup and brown sugar sticky and then it gives to an odd banana thing that has a medicinal edge to it before an oddly orange-flavored finish.

Smell is heavy on the brown sugar and caramel. Hints of almond, ethanol and dark fruit come into play, but this smells like a sweet syrupy mess. Taste is definitely sweet with a bit of an alcohol presence. Syrupy caramel and brown sugar abound with hints of prunes and plums up front. I can feel the alcohol next and long after every sip, it is a bit too present in this beer. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet sticky syrupy mouthfeel. Im not sure how a 9.3 abv beer can be called an alt, but thats beside the point. This beer is too big, too hot, and too sweet. Reminds me more of a sweet old ale, and might cellar fairly well.

1441,"2012-04-09",3.9,"A: Pours a rusty copper colored body reminiscent of iced tea. Theres a good bit of clarity considering how (relatively) dark the body is. The head is a two-finger heavy cream color with downright impressive retention and lacing.

S: Note I have little to no experience drinking altbiers, but its dark fruit notes (raisin, plum, fig) combined with the caramel and toffee are very reminiscent of a good dopplebock. Theres also a good deal of both earthiness and zestiness, suggesting this is fairly well hopped.

T/M: Again, lots of caramel and toffee flavor is augmented with raisinesque fruitiness. At first, it reminds me of rum-soaked raisins without the alcohol flavor - quite an impressive accomplishment. Despite its initially heavy feel, the finish is crisp, zesty, and downright refreshing, with the noble hops helping to impart a pleasant dry bitterness on the tongue and the carbonation to help ease it down even more. I think its well balanced and highly drinkable, but not the most complex brew by any stretch.

Aroma: The nose has some some caramel malts, a little spice, yeast, and fruity notes

Appearance: Pours a clear dark reddish-orange color with a creamy beige head and light-mid lace

Overall Impression: 
Eh, this one wasnt great.  First off, I was disappointed because it didnt give me that orange/grapefruit hop presence that the description promised.

1441,"2012-03-30",3.6,"It pours clear, deep amber with sticky beige foam, settling eventually. Smells like apricots, brown sugar, alcohol, straw. The flavor is sweet but not cloying, touches of cocoa and bread crust bitterness, with a big malty caramel backbone. Its full bodied, but on the lighter side of that; slightly syrupy and slick. It finishes with a touch of dry hoppyness blending well with the toasty bitterness and lingering a bit. Wish I could say I made it.","Nompton, Oklahoma, USA","swanmann"
1441,"2012-03-30",3.5,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle.  It pours a mahogany amber with a large, foamy cream colored head.  Excellent clarity. The aroma is malty, syrupy, dark fruity, with a slight alcohol bite due to the 9.3% ABV.  The body is medium to bold. The taste tends to start out sweet but a pungent bitterness roars from behind almost immediately. A decent but potent altbier.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
1441,"2012-03-30",3.1,"Bottle. Clear dark amber pour with a smaller cream head. Aroma is malt with a hint of citrus. Moderate palate. Taste is malty, nutty, and a touch of bitter and sweetness. Decent brew.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
1441,"2012-03-28",3.8,"Aroma is fruit, a mild nuttiness, some sweetness and a strong hint of alcohol.  The flavor is heavy malts, ESB-like fruitiness, and a warming alcohol finish.  With the alcohol, I was expecting an ASA due to the normal ABV of this style, but it was an almost non-factor, this was a good altbier on its own.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
1441,"2012-03-27",2.7,"Pours clear mahogany with 2-finger tan head.  Nose is big vinyl caramel malt, hops, citrus.  Tastes malty, rich, hot, with a lot of fusels, some model glue smell/taste, low level yellow raincoat, and some hops. Im not sure if Jim Koch is adding prservatives to these or the recipes are suspect, but this is the 3rd or 4th Longshot beer that Ive gotten vinyl, model glue, and/or butyric acid smell and taste in.  I think the secret of this alt is that it is a repackaging of the Longshot hot fuselly barleywine from a few years ago.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
1441,"2012-03-27",2.1,"Bottle.  Cherry syrup malt aroma.  Dark chestnut color with moderate head.  Sweet syrupy malt and moderately bitter herbal/quinine flavor.   Rough.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
1441,"2012-03-26",3.8,"Bottle. Pours dark, clear amber with rich beige head. Aroma has a strong toasted malt back bone with small hints of grapefruit and orange in the back ground. Flavor is very toasted malt forward, some brown sugar with a alcohol spiciness that comes through nicely and hints at toffee and very subtle orange with a nice aged flavor, sweet maltiness and signs of dark fruit. Medium-heavy mouthfeel with medium-high carbonation. Overall, at first glance I was kinda shocked to see an alt bier in the line up but after tasting it, I now understand. Solid brew!","Mata Gorda, Texas, USA","SphinxTX"
1441,"2012-03-26",3.4,"Deep copper color with a foamy tan head. The aroma has hints of caramel, bread and citrus. There are flavors of toffee and grains with a malty body and a slightly sweet finish.","Neenah, Wisconsin, USA","mcjay"
1441,"2012-03-25",2.5,"12oz bottle poured into a Kölsch glass at 40°.  Color is a deep amber with light carbonation and a rocky off white head.  Aroma of caramel and banana.  It has a medium body with a rich somewhat creamy mouth feel.  Flavor is a lot like the aroma, coming in sweet with caramel, sugar, vanilla and a yeasty banana.  In the after taste these flavors hang on a bit with a very light bitterness.  Overall its ok, not a style I like and is a little too sweet.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"
1441,"2012-03-25",2.9,"Bottle from Casa De Oro. Interesting nose. Sweet and fairly hoppy. Seems sweet like an alt, but highly hopped. Tastes too hoppy for the style.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
1441,"2012-03-24",3.9,"Pours a reddish-brown color with a thin ringed head.  Aroma is biscuit, bready malt, toffee, and light brown sugar.  Taste is very smooth, taste is brown sugar, toffee and caramel malts - full-bodied and the alcohol is hidden very well.  Solid!","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Petrucci914"
1441,"2012-03-24",3.5,"copper pour with a thick tan head.

1441,"2012-03-24",3.5,"Pours a clear cola color with a decent light tan head.  Mild earthy aroma.  Sweet roasted malt flavor with some notes of buttery caramel and toffee. Theres a tartness there as well on the back along with some hop bitterness.  ABV is barely evident, making itself known as warmth after the swallow.  Mighty fine effort.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
1441,"2012-03-23",3.2,"A clear, iced tea colored beer with a medium beige head.  The aroma is caramel and floral hops.  The flavor is roasty malt with a slightly floral finish.","Missouri, USA","fiercepanda"
1441,"2012-03-22",3.9,"Pours a dark amber withi medium off-white head, lots of lacing.  Aroma obvious of sweet caramel malt, citrus, and floral hops.  Flavor matches well and is quite a nice surprise with how well it comes together.","Macomb, Michigan, USA","dmschefke"
1441,"2012-03-22",3.7,"Dark ruby color with an inch of dense tan head. Aroma and taste are richly caramelized, with some astringency, and slight medicinal hit. Not overly boozy, but rich and well dialed.

Aroma is caramel and toffee, quite a lot of cherry, some spicy hops notes.  Flavor is quite sweet with a long, sweet, fruity finish.

1441,"2011-10-08",4.0,"GABF 2011.  Dark clear rosy brownish ruby. Small but lasting head. Great aroma of sweet cherries paired with toasty toffee malt, and a touch of candy sugar. Flavor is nice and big with some cherry and other darker fruity tones, candy sugar and deep roasty toffee tones, slightly burnt, in a good way. Pretty swell!","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
