4398,"2012-11-02",3.4,"0.33l bottle from #416. This one also pops out of the bottle seconds after popping the cap. Experienced as I am with these Birradamare beers, I opened it over my kitchen sink so no catastrophic consequences here. Anyhow, it pours a deep dark brown body with a medium sized somewhat lasting brown little top. The nose is light roasted and kinda coffee acidic. Some thin chocolate paper also in here. Its creamy and almost lively on the carbonation. The flavors are not all bad either. Coffee and chocolate, the light burned kind with that clear soft gentle acidic touch found in the aroma. Some might say that its a bit thin and almost on the border of being watery, but its undoubtedly light drinkable, chocolaty, smooth and quite flavorful.
