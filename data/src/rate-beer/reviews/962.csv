The smell started off with some banana esters, sweet grass, lemongrass, sweet wheat, subtle herbal to earthy character. Light white and black pepper slide in for the balance. Belgian yeast ever so slightly.
The taste was a dry grassy sweet to spicy flavor balancing between some herbal and earthy character. Dry banana to fruity estery aftertaste (fairly quick). Quick dry finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a crisp sweet sessionability about it. Carbonation runs good, leaning towards a lighter side but not too light. Some light crisp stickiness tries to hit my tongue, its nice and not overbearing.

The beer was hoppy, but not really bitter, allowing the sweet flavors and delicate phenols from the wheat beer side of the construction come through clearly.

Very slightly hazy, pastel yellow with a 4-finger yellow-tinged off-white head and very good lacing. 

Aroma of coriander, lemon, cloves, wheat, yeast and mild banana. 

Taste of wheat, cloves, lemon, coriander, grass, bitter citric hops and Belgian yeast. The hops come through much more strongly once the beer warms a bit. 

Medium/light body and medium/high carbonation. 

While short of being a great witbier, the hops and the ABV keep it interesting. I was put off at first, but this is growing on me--maybe because the flavor (and especially the hops) come through more strongly as the beer warns.

Taste is not exactly what you would expect from the aroma but it is not surprising either. Taste has a definite hoppiness. Not too bitter but not subdued like a standard Belgian ale. Nice bit of complexity but also very drinkable and easy to quaff. A hint of sweetness. Quite good.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

Hops aromas of light pine, citrus, and rosemary. Some hints of apricot and light berries. Sweet fruity start, followed by an onslaught of hops. Bitter to biting. Alcohol seems to show a bit more presence than I might have expected. Quite herbal and bitter in the finish and linger with gentian, wormwood, sage and wintergreen. Nice feel. Soft, with a light lifting carbonation. To me the flavors are more overly sharp and intense. Id be curious if a little time might mellow this one out.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

962,"2016-03-30",3.4,"Bottle.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly lasting.
Body is hazy light to medium yellow.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly to moderately hoppy (herbs), lightly yeasty (basement), with strong notes of orange/lemon oil, grains of paradise, pepper, other note of gum.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. 

This almost seems like a spiced/herbed version of Hop House...the aroma is overly intense in a herbal-spiced way, much more adjuncty than hoppy (whether or not spices/herbs were added, the effect is that there was, it does not smell natural). Not unpleasant, but too harsh to be happy about. Nicer in its other aspects, though...good flavor balance and fluffy mouthfeel with a pretty head and body. Shame the aroma isnt more enticing, this couldve been a winner.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
