3329,"2017-04-12",4.0,"Tap @ Oberphalzer hof. Pours cloudy orange with a white head. Aroma of bready malts, light grassy, notes of honey, spicey/herbal touch with some light minerals. Taster is well rounded between flavours, loads of hops and bready malts, super smooth and soft, light bitternes, rather fruity.","Odense C, DENMARK","MrOrla"
3329,"2017-02-07",3.5,"Sampled at the Oberpfälzer Hof, Windischeschenbach as the hous Zoigl.
Small but lasting beighe head.Opque amber color. Very nice malty aroma from pils and light roasted malts. Mild and tasty with a small bitterness.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","TEJA"
3329,"2017-01-20",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Orangey hops and honeyed malts combine over notes of toasted bread crust in this personable Zoiglbier.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the hazy golden amber.
-Carbonation is soft, which makes the mouthfeel appear rounder, smoother.
-Drinkability is optimal.
-The finish is just bitter enough to keep things interesting on the second pint.

On tap at Oberfpalzer Hof.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

3329,"2015-12-09",3.7,"Draft at  Oberpfalzer Hof Windisch. (2009-2012) and Beim Heigl in Schirmitz (2014). Mostly clear orange-amber with a white foamy head. Aroma is fruity / juicy with notes of orange jelly. Malt is pound cake, yeast is slightly chalky. Medium body, carbonation is sharp and pointed, finish is short. More sweet than bitter. In decent shape at both Heigl and the Oberpfalzer Hof (who pours this as their own). (3.5)

Bayrischer anstich at Binner Windischeschenbach, November 2015. Hazed honey gold with a short white head. Bright, clean, and hoppy (for Windisch.); toasted grain, nuts, pastries, apricot, dried herbs from the aroma hops.; malt sugar has that wonderful honey-glazed pastry effect, and in the mouth its minerally, snappy, and crisp.

3329,"2015-10-05",3.8,"Draughts@Oberpfälzer Hof, W-bach 10/2015. ""Batches brewed together with Binner"". Amber-russet pour - the deeper orange variety that sets W-Bach apart from their greenyellow neighbours/rivals in Neuhaus. - Flowery, then fruity malt aromatics (""lieblich""), opening up to drier Sahnekaramell aka Werthers Echte joined by chalky, near-mineral notes. Wonderful, moreish blend more butterscotch Munich malts and wood-herbal hop notes, buttered bread, a late leafy hop bitterness to round things off. Somewhere in between all that: watery pockets. Quality roast, finishing on buttered breadcrust.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

Schwach rezent, schlank und weich im Mund, geht runter wie Öl. Im Abgang schön trockene, nicht besonders fruchtige aber hopfenherbe Bittere, zart rauchig.

3329,"2014-11-23",3.9,"Draught at Beim Heigl in Schirmitz: Hazed orange with golden highlights. Creamy and sticky halo of foam. Bright and clean aroma of orange marmalade, flowers, lemon, pecan, minerals and piecrust. Lush carbonation. Soft, refined malt links up with a lustrous and succulent orangey fruitiness, initially. Harmonious interplay of expressive flower nectar and an edgeless base of pils malt, which mimics new-mown hay. Multilayered maltiness spawns deep cookie, toasted bread, and softer toffee kisses. Juicy melanoidins shyly lurk amid silky, lip-smacking Cara-malt sugars. Appetizing contrast of explosive fruitiness and scratchy minerals blend with an invigorating splash of lemony acids. Pervasive fruitiness flourishes atop the lean malt and clean attenuation. Rustic yeast notes enrich the deep toast and lush hay with notable dustiness in the cohesive finish. Another delightful zoiglbier that doesnt try to wow you with grandiosity or pretentiousness, as singular and well-crafted as it is. Fruity, balanced, minerally, good malt detail, and overall just lovely.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

More minerally in character than the others, which I did not favor, but that may have been the way it came across the palate given the extra carbonation.  A bit thin.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
3329,"2009-06-21",3.9,"At the hotel/stube. Bright orange-gold with big lasting white fluffy head, lacing, and lots of rising bubbles. Aroma is bakery fresh bread, dough, and has a nice sweetness to it. Palate is grainy and relatively high carbonation for a Zoigl. Has a nice husky but hoppy bitterness in the finish. Very much a bread crust and toast flavor, more so than the color would suggest. Great yeasty finish.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"

Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.

One of the more malty renditions I sampled (I wrote ""liquid bread"" in the margin of my review sheet).  Not terribly distinctive otherwise, but a great quaffer as usual.Earlier Rating: 12/2/2007 Total Score: 3.5At Beim Binner, Windischeschenbach.

Head is mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy dark yellow to light amber.

Marvelous atmosphere here...a home, basically, so youre sitting in their living room at communal tables.  The beer doesnt separate itself from other zoigls too much, but as usual its a great quaffer and would be easy to drink liter upon liter of.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
