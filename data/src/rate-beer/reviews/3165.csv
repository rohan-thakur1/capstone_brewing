3165,"2017-03-08",4.2,"375 mL bottle. Originally reviewed sometime in 2013.

 Murky red. Decent off-white head. Nice collar and wispy surface.

Smells of tons of raspberry. Cherry is secondary. Musty and acidic.

Flavor is so much raspberry as well. Cherry is still secondary. Musty and jammy. Very tart. Oaky finish.

Strong, clean sourness. Well carbonated and dry.

Excellent. More raspberry than Framboise de Amorosa from what I remember.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3165,"2016-11-30",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed this at Mickeys 30th birthday bash on November 05. 375 mL bottle. The pour is a darker reddish pink color with a thin pink head and no lace as it falls to a thin collar. The aroma of this is awesome. It is really acidic up front, but it smells like a jar of Smuckers. Its crazy. There is a bright raspberry, sourness and a light oak. The flavor is tart and sour raspberry. Its really good. This is a little sourer than I would anticipate, but its excellent. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly acetic raspberry on the back end. Its awesome. Im a big fan.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3165,"2016-04-01",4.1,"375ml bottle acquired via trade on BA. Shared with deyholla. Pours a rich glowing reddish raspberry hue, fiery winter sunset and healthy berry tinged glow with some decent haziness. A frothy offwhite slightly pinkish head dies down to a nice ringer, lacing ok overall. Aromas are big fruity raspberry, seedy and jammy with some decent oak, sour cherries, red berry parfait and some lactic yogurty appeal. Decent vanillin, oak, and earthy appeal. Lots of fresh seedy raspberry that has really held up. Potent, punchy, sour and seedy. Not necessarily complex but rich, juicy, and really draws you in. Initial is more dry, tannic, a bit bitter as that lush nose doesnt necessarily full though. Firmer twangy and acidic play, yogurt, lots of fruit up front tapers off to a warmer, more funky and tannic backend. Red wine, some spirit and warmth. A more dry, tannic, and funky backend but still never loses the spirit of the nose and front. While its impossible to deliver what the nose offers, this one drinks nice and flows pretty well. Especially on the backend where funk and tannic berryskin, oak kick it up and dry it out. Tasty stuff, impressive nose and pour. Really enjoyable derivative of Framboise with that funky and more oaky backend, funk all the while delivering an intense nose. Perhaps a bit acidic at times bordering on some harshness but thats a bit fleeting at times.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Funky aroma with a nice lactic presence along with dry toasted oak and a blast of luscious berries. Very fruit forward with jammy raspberry, currant and other vinous fruits. Funky bugs/barnyard character counter the fruit sweetness and theres a subtle acetic character as well. 

Fuller bodied than expected and really complex with lots of musty bugs, earthy oak, lactic funk and vinous dark berries. Luscious raspberry bursting forth making it seedy and jammy along with some chery and currant. Dry with nice acidity and lactic funk. Subtle acetone quality but not harshly solvent or over the top.

Pours a light brown with a mild reddish hue to it. The initial pink-hued head fades pretrty quickly into a thin collar around the edges of the glass.

The nose has some cherry and a bit of raspberry. Neither is nearly as strong as the fruit character from Box Set Track #7. Some additional earthiness in the background. Acidity is mostly lactic with just a very mild touch of acetic.

Flavor is earthy and mildly sour. Quite a bit of cherry skin. Moderate raspberry character underneath. Faint hints of black raspberry. Could use a bit more depth.

Mouthfeel is light-medium with an appropriate amount of acidity and carbonation. Very dry finish. Ever so slight tannins.

Again, very nice, but nothing out of control.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"

Very excited to try this one, as I am a big fan of both beers used in this blend. 

The beer appears lavender hued with an oily beige head. The beer smells fantastic! Raspberries and Lost Abbey funk. A nice blend of the two beers, with the Framboise playing the lead role. Sufficient tartness in the finish, with a lingering assortment of berries. Nice feel. Effervescent and tangy with spritzy carbonation. A dem fine beer, I say.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
3165,"2012-06-19",4.0,"Bottle. Pours a nice dark red color with a small pinkish head. Aroma is quite funky, with horse blanket, barnyard, nice sourness too of cherries and raspberries. The flavor is quite tart with lots of cherry and raspberry, a little balsamic vinegar, oak, some funk with old musty flavors, barnyard and horse blanket. The body is light with a dry mouth feel. Overall an awesome Sour!","Nørresundby, DENMARK","beerisgoodforu"
3165,"2012-06-04",4.2,"Red / purple color with a smallish pink/white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of raspberries, cherries, wood, vanilla, oak,and light oxidation. Taste of much of the same, with strong raspberry presence and quite. Sour finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
3165,"2012-05-28",4.0,"Bottle at Lost Abbey. Pours with a bloody, deep red hue with a foamy, pink-red tinged head. Aromas are hugely vinous, jammy, fruity, funky, red wine. A bit waxy, fruity, cherry, earthy, raspberry, acidic with a lot of malic acidity. Quite funky. Red Poppy is by far the stronger note on the nose. Flavors are tart, huge berry character with strong malic acid. Quite tart, waxy and earthy brett funk. Red wine, big vinous notes, medium tannin mingles with the funk. Light lemon verbena. Very lively bubbles, dry, fully vinous, tart and tannic. Good. Quite a bit of fruit character (just like this years batch of Red Poppy and Framboise).","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
3165,"2012-05-26",4.0,"375mL bottle @ LA. Murky burgundy with a one finger creamy pink head, good retention. Aroma is basically Red Poppy, cherries and old wood dominate. Not a lot, but some tartness present. Flavor does add some raspberries as well as a fair amount of acid. Cherries and their skin still dominate to the bone dry woody finish, just a bit of earthy bitterness. Has the same light Ludens cough drop note I get in Red Poppy. Moderate to high carbonation with a medium body. A fruitier RP that dominates the Framboise de Amorosa-was hoping for a more even blend of flavors (I realize it is a 50/50 blend) and red wine.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
3165,"2012-05-19",4.2,"Bottle at lost abbey.  Muddy cherry red pour, deep color, nice chunky pink head with wisps of purple.  Looks like a beer fruit smoothie.  Raspberry, sweet cherry, berry, acidic tartness, strong sourness, tons of fruit.  Fresh berries, seeds, tart.  Another really nice lost abbey ftuited sour.  Like an amped up FdA.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
3165,"2012-05-19",4.0,"Bottle.  Dark red pour with a slick of scattered tan foam and steady, active carbonation.  Aroma is sharp, dry oak followed by a melange of tart fruit with the cherry most prominent.  Taste is oak with tart cherry, perhaps raspberry but its hard to pull out and sour, wine like grapes.  Crisp, dry mouthfeel.  Great sour.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"
3165,"2012-05-09",4.0,"Short-lived, red-pink head over deep ruby-red beer, hazy. Intense fruity nose: cherry, raspberry, and something else. Vinous, and a little aroma of cucumber. Fruity esters, non yeast-related. Very dry, cherry flavour, intensely fruity; finishes as dry as the Sahara. Fluffy-fruity texture, fruitbodied, tart, acidic, bonedry. Another fruitgem from the San Marcoz wizard.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
