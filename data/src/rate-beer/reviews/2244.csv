2244,"2013-05-06",2.5,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2013 28/IV/13 - on tap @ Zythos Bierfestival (2013-431) Thanks to Emiel for sharing the beer!
Note: besides that the beer is a pretty crappy lambic, they should be given extra minus points for putting such a shitty hostess at their stand during the most important beer festival in Belgium. As my co-worker ordered this beer, he said: ""ah, a nice lambic, theres nothing like it. I always like to start my festival day with a lambic, its a nice and good beer"". To which the dessed up 20 year old girl responded with an emotionless face: ""if thats what you think..."" and then started pouring. Wow, what a way to make good publicity. Hint for the big breweries: put your brewers in your festival stand, or for my part a sales rep with some technical knowlegde. Not some dressed up and plastered bimbo who knows shit about beer.
Bit cloudy pale yellow beer, big bubbled head, little stable. Aroma: very floral, bread dough, plain weird. Is this even lambic? MF: no carbon, light body, feels a bit slick. Taste: little bitter, floral (elder flowers?), bit lemony, vegetables. Aftertaste: very weird, little bitter, yeasty. What is this? A batch that even La Bécasse did not want, so they decided to sell it at a beer festival? Where you have, like, almost professional beer tasters and lambic lovers who come to discover your beer? No, this is one huge disappointment.","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"

It has a deep clear gold body with copper hues that supports a near white head of foam. The modest aroma has some vague tartness mixing with an apple like sweetness. The taste starts sort of neutral and then picks up a bit of sour citrus that is sweetened quickly with a mild apple flavored sugariness.

This is I presume where the idea came about for the Faro served at the Publican in Chicago. Having had both I cant say that I think this one is markedly better, but I think theyre akin and the folks making the Faro either for or at the Publican did a great job both in presentation and catching the great balance of sour and sweet flavors that this one does.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

The flavor is clearly sweetened, but there is a slight bit of sourness on the finish.  Cant shake the thought of there being darker malts used in making this vs most other Lambics.

Pours from the crock with a clear, light amber, golden hue.  It is topped by a large bubbled, but flat head.  This smells very much like apple cider with a deep smell even yielding notes of caramel, sweet tea, a faint vinegar like note as well as a sweet nuttiness.

The beer is quite sweet tasting, but still thin bodied and simplistically very cider like.  There is a touch of caramelized apple character here.  A faint tartness seems more apple like than from lactic acid, despite the fact that it must actually be from lactic acid.  There is perhaps a touch of acetic acid here that accentuates and brings out an apple cider vinegar like flavor in the finish.  After having the 3 Fonteinen Faro a couple blocks away it is amazing how absolutely pathetic this beer is.  It tastes like apple cider juice with no complexity and lots of cloying sweetness.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2244,"2006-01-07",2.9,"Couleur dorée pale, aucune mousse.  Faible caractère de pomme verte, de citron et de brettanomyces rapidement dominé par le sucre.  Faible acidité en bouche, finale mi-sèche, faible carbonatation.  Tout de même rafraîchissant.  En fût, le laboureur, Bruxelles, Décembre 2005.","Quebec, CANADA","OlivierMTL"
2244,"2005-12-13",3.7,"Draught at A la Becasse, Brussel. Amber coloured. Sweet fruity aroma. Refreshing apple juice flavour with some sugary sweetness and some acidity. Rather dry finish. Very low carbonation. Well balanced.","København, DENMARK","Hildigöltur"

2244,"2005-10-04",2.2,"Very low citrus aroma offers some farmhouse character.  Clear copper coloured body with large bubbled, fizzy, off white, fully diminishing head.  Lightly sour, lightly acidic up front with a citrus character and lasting sweetness.  Strong, prickly, aggressive carbonation to the very dry and somewhat light body.  Bottle sampled at RBESG 2005.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
2244,"2005-09-13",3.2,"Bottle. Didnt realise this was a faro. BUt anyway, its not bad, but its no way near to matching the best lambics ive had. Slight barnyard and citrus characters in the aroma. Palate was quite soft, and though being quite dry, its quite sweet for a lambic. Some tart acidity, but quite relaxed and easy to handle.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
2244,"2005-09-05",3.6,"A Mes rate: 
On tap at the wonderful La Becasse in Brussels. Im going to buck the trend and give this a better rate. Admitted its a strange one but I enjoy it every time I have it. Served in a large earthen ware jug. Almost totally flat. Orange like iron bru. Sweet aroma of cherries, vanilla and orange. Tiny hint of carb in the palate.Nice sweet and sour finish. Very sinkable. Strange but good.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

2244,"2005-08-26",3.7,"RBESG05: Gold with a white head. Lacks nose, just mildly sour. Refreshingly tart yet still sweet. Really good. Juicy citric fruits. Best Faro yet!","Perth, Western Australia, AUSTRALIA","kook"

2244,"2005-08-18",3.6,"An orange beer with a thin white disappearing head. The aroma contains both sweet and sour notes as well as notes of wood and grapefruit (part of the sour spectrum). The flavor is only slightly acidic and reminds me of the vitamin pills I had when I was a kid - nice, I just never had it in a beer - if it is as healthy as vitamin pills, then Ill take one a day ;-)","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
2244,"2005-08-18",3.8,"Sampled at RBESG 2005.
What a nice surprise to see this on the line-up of a great tasting session! 
Ultra fast dying white head, clear golden body. 
Sharp and fresh aroma of grapefruit and wood, good sourness. Flavor is sour at first with some sweetness showing up. Pretty tart but it dies rather fast. Grapefruit tones. Like a sweeten geuze (I know thats what a faro is, but this one is just a bit different from the usual faro). I like it!","Brooklyn, Alabama, USA","Jeppe"
2244,"2005-08-17",2.7,"(on bottle at RBESG 2005)As Madsbergs says ""distinct barnyard touch""; yeah; I would say closer to a pigspen, yuk. mild flavour on the other hand, very malty and a modest finish.","DENMARK","JensenTaster"

Clear amber colour, small head. Fruity aroma, some barnyard, Sweet and juicy with short cherry/apple flavour, and no more than a vague hint of lactic acidity. Not bad in itself, but a joke in comparison with the real lambics.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"

2244,"2002-12-31",3.1,"&#8220;Looks like Apfelsaft&#8221; says Joe V. Indeed it does. Tastes and smells like apple juice too. No carbonation and little sourness. Very smoothed and enjoyable drink, though. Served in a stone pitcher at A La Becasse. Mmmmm.","GERMANY","pivo"
2244,"2002-12-30",3.4,"ale bécasse, Brussels: peach and apple juice nose.Orange body with hints of red. Sour apple taste. More like an Frankfurter Applewine. Served in stone mugs. Nice.","New Jersey, USA","YogiBeera"
2244,"2001-12-02",2.9,"Light taste, only slightly sour.  Similar to a faro, but stronger and not quite as sugary.  Fairly straightforward character and like Timmermans Faro this is very refreshing.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
