3400,"2017-06-18",4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass; 2015 vintage bottling, 9.9%. Pours fairly crystal clear dark ruby red/light brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge sweet/sour/tangy cherries, raisin, plum, raspberry, blackberry, currant, red grape, lemon, lime, green apple, almond, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, brown sugar, caramel, and bread; with light notes of leathery funk, red wine vinegar, pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with amazing balance and complexity of fruity/acidic yeast, cherries, wine/bourbon barrels, and dark/bready malt notes; with big strength. Taste of huge sweet/sour/tangy cherries, raisin, plum, raspberry, blackberry, currant, red grape, lemon, lime, green apple, almond, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, brown sugar, caramel, and bread; with light notes of leathery funk, red wine vinegar, pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate fruity/lactic tart/sourness; light yeast/oak spiciness and fruit tang on the finish. Lingering notes of sweet/sour cherries, raisin, plum, raspberry, blackberry, currant, red grape, lemon, lime, green apple, almond, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, brown sugar, caramel, bread, light funk/vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, cherries, wine/bourbon barrels, and dark/bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/tart/sourness balance, and minimal puckering flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from tart/sourness and yeast/oak spiciness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/silky/acidic, and lightly tangy/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is amazing. Minimal warming alcohol for 9.9%. Overall this is an insane fruited Flanders red ale style! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, cherries, wine/bourbon barrels, and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drink with the balanced lactic/tannic/drying finish. Perfectly balanced complexity from all flavors. A highly amazing offering, and world class fruited sour ale. One of the best Ive ever had.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

3400,"2015-12-31",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2016 Fantastic aroma of oaky dark fruit and lactic sour. So complex. Fig, raisin, oak, almost a mild Woody cherry. Taste is lactic sour, maybe 5 or 6 of 10, very balanced and not overly sour for cascade beers. Dark, and almost a dry finish. Woody dark fruit flavors give enough balance to the sour. Flavors of fig, raisin, oak and slight sweet with some vanilla bourbon, the bourbon Woody flavors are so balanced and not boozy at all. A slight tannic Woody finish. That is the only slight negative to this beer, it is almost like it aged a bit too long and got too woody? But that is a slight negative ( having this again and do not feel it is too Woody, so I would remove that as a slight negative and am bumping from4.7 to 4.8. It is so complex and just great) . It is so complex and a great sour. Really good. Read on the bottle after the fact that it is aged on Bing cherries. The cherry flavors I get from it tasted like they were all from the wood.

On sent que lacidité nest pas quattribuable au bois mais à une cerise bien jeune mais timide. Finale sèche, cette bière ne figure pas parmi mes préférées de cette dégustation.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

3400,"2014-04-02",3.3,"Bottle at EBF, 3/22/14Very nice pour, obviously bottle conditioned, unfiltered, etc...Moderately hazy chocolate-auburn body is topped by a medium-beige head showing moderate retention.Quite lactic in the nose with what is either just a very sharp, concentrated acidity, or more likely, some bitter, dry, roasted barley acidity. Some more vibrancy is added to the nose via some light cherry-like fruitiness, though it itself is quite tart keeping things quite intensely tart/sour/dry. A touch of caramel malt-like sweetness is slightly noticeable with more warming and there is certainly a little too much booziness at this level of dryness.Until reading this description, I didnt realize this was intended as a Flemish sour, actually just paying attention to the ""noir in the name and taking it to be a stout-like sour. I thought the flavors really supported this notion, as its definitely got some burnt character to it, a little bit of chocolate and none of the very boisterous red fruit character I associate with Flemish sours, whether fruited or not. There is certainly acetic acid here, but its leaner and tempered with a balsamic, nearly coffee-like note.  So yes, a bit muddled in the flavor, as I always find dark sours to be, with the roastiness kind of at odds with the brett, though less so the lactic elements. Very nice mouthfeel, however, lightly slick, but with plenty of tight carbonation and not overattenuated (nor under). A bit dirty/yeasty tasting at times.  Alcohol not as evident in the flavor as in the nose.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Dark color, off-white head. Cherry dominates the aroma.

Pretty purple ale with some light pink surface bubbles. Up front in the nose for me are the bing cherries and pinot notes. Nice and full bodied with a hint of ink and cassis. Some hints of alcohol and oak alongside leather and sweat. I like the already. The flavor carries more of the grape than Id anticipated - refined, plummy and juicy. A bit of booze (maybe whiskey..) comes through just in the back end, but as an accent and overture - really nice. Medium bodied with moderate on hi carb.

Seedy cherries and cherryskin, lactic acidity, no real vinegar or balsamic presence though. The Bourbon elements sound like theyd be offensive or overwhelming but on this particular sour they really do work. Firmly lactic, zingy and black cherry. Not hot or ABV offensive. The Bourbon element truly is interesting, well integrated, and works really well to my surprise. Quite a unique beer here and one of the best darker Bourbon influenced sours Ive ever had.

3400,"2012-12-31",3.6,"The beer is a touch of a slow gusher, a steady pour into my Bruery tulip produces a two finger thick, pale amber tinged, dark tan colored head. The beer is a concentrated amber color that shows a lightly hazy, bright red hue when held up to the light. The aroma has a fruitiness to it that makes me think of not quite ripe grapes, tannic red wine, and a soft, but somehow bright cherry character towards the finish. Lots of toasted notes are brought out by both some wood character as well as by the caramelized malt notes. There is a spiciness to the nose that is brought out by the wood; it is slightly peppery and sort of leans towards green wood somehow. Notes of vanillin are noticeable at times.

Nicely tart up front, and quite a bit lighter bodied than I was expecting. The sourness lingers through to the finish of each sip where it accentuates a touch of cherry flavors. Lots of woodiness is found in the flavor, spicy, oak-laden, tannic, plus lots of Bourbon flavors in the finish; the latter provide a sort of Bourbon melon character, some definite warming character, and a distinct, somewhat diluted Bourbon flavor that is actually noticeable up front, and then again in the finish of each sip. Soft vanilla notes start to come out as the beer warms up, and the oak softens, and gets less astringent. Soft fruit flavors of cherries, tamarind, hints of melon, some light berry notes, and a definite red wine like fruitiness. The body is light for the strength, but does have some medium feel to this.

Quite nice, more complex due to the multi-barrel aging and the Bourbon barrel character is kept low enough that it adds to the complexity without overwhelming the beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Pours a deep garnet brown with a huge tan head that slowly dissipates and leaves much lace on the way down. Smells of balsamic, cherries, lemon and funk. Light alcohol note and a touch of wood. The flavor is complex and varied. Up front I get some sweet cherries and a light sweet maltiness. Tart cherries, a bit of lactic acid and lemons destroy the sweetness in short order. Woody oak come in next with a bit of funk and vinegar and an ever increasing lactic tartness. The finish leaves a lingering sweet tart candy feel on my taste buds.

It pours a murky rusty colour, started off with over a finger head of foam but that quickly dissipated. Very little lacing left behind.

You can certainly smell the sour cherries and the oak barrel. Some slight note of vanilla there. My nose is happy.

Tart cherries up front in the taste, oak flavours not so much. Alcohol extremely well hidden when it comes to what sits and swirls in my mouth, some definite warming during and after the swallow. Sour, yeah, but not overly so. Very slight hint of a vinegar sourness so I dont *think* that heartburn will be an issue.

Very tasty from the get go; I opened it at near room temp to get all of the flavours rather than opening after pulling from the fridge.

A delightfully delicious Wild Ale that I wish had a bit less alcohol to make it even more drinkable; as is, its still and an easy drop to tip back.

A - Dark red body that is pretty damn murky. Two finger high dirty tan head formed and settled down to a thin cap with nice edging. Really thick lacing with crazy retention. Really gorgeous looking beer.

S - I dont mean this in a bad way whatsoever but the aroma reminds me of a cherry infused bourbon, only much much better and milder. Fresh and natural tart cherries lead into warming oak tannins and vanilla. A bit of cinnamon and nutmeg on the finish. Its so complex, layered, and delicious while remaining mild and light. The whisky barrels are noticeable and the pinot barrels seem to just accent and calm down the sourness of the cherries with a bit of vinous red wine notes. Seriously one of the best aromas I have found in a wild ale.

T - Tart and vibrant cherries, oak, vanilla, and cinnamon. A light sour finish with some acetic and vinegar notes that youll find in a flanders oud bruin. Not as complex or amazing as the nose, but extremely delicious and refreshing. Mouth feel is medium and coating with light carbonation. Alcohol well hidden.

O - I found their Kriek too be enjoyable, but a bit simple. This just puts that beer to absolute shame. What an amazing use of cherries. I think I prefer this to any Belgian kriek or even fruit lambic that I have tried as the whiskey and pinot barrel notes are just so smooth and seem to compliment the bing cherries.

Light acetic acid and hints of funk with ever so slight notes of wood and alcohol. The flavor is very wine like with strong notes of cherry, oak and lighter notes of prunes and alcohol. The sour aspect of this beer is spot on. Not too abrasive, but enough sharpness to keep things lively. The acetic vinegar flavors are at reasonable levels for the style. The body and mouthfeel are pretty full and rich, again reminding me of a red wine. Not as funky as I would have liked, but that may come with a bit of age. Pretty drinkable for a challenging style.

3400,"2012-02-13",3.9,"Huge thanks to barleywinefiend for snagging this longtime want and getting it to drabmuh and I, thus setting up the Cascade sour tasting. Served in a Cascade Barrel House goblet.

Pours a mostly-clear crimson color with a short off-white head and a bit of lacing as it goes down. Thin collar throughout. Really a nice color.

The nose starts out with plenty of red-wine notes and lactic acid on the first pour when its quite cold. As it warms, the cherry starts to come out along with a touch of oak. Im not sure if whiskey-barrel portions are still used in the blend, as I dont get much of that. (Side note: I wish that were stronger, as adding a bit of Bourbonic to a shot glass of this made it even better.)

The flavor takes the components to the next level, creating a more-complete beer. The red-wine notes are still strong and work really well with the acidity from the lacto. The cherries complement those characteristics perfectly. A bit of oak in the background rounds things out. The Pinot and light oak tannins combine beautifully with the acidity to produce a fantastic mouthfeel. Light with good carbonation and a brisk, acidic finish.

Overall, a really solid beer. I had waited a long time to be able to grab this one, and it delivered. At the same time, I think it could have been a truly great beer with a bit more whiskey character in the blend, sort of a Cherry Adam from the Wood with red wine and acidity.

Lovely sour aroma swiftly climbs out of the glass and smacks you a bout. First taste hits your mouth and makes the eyes crinkle up with the tart flavor. After a few sips you really get to delve into the complexity of the flavors and the beautiful bouquet really opens up for you.  Incredible beer.","Vancouver, Washington, USA","Dubbercody"

Deep purply black with bright garnet highlights and a thick, loose, rocky, sudsy tannish head with faint pinkish/lavender undertones. Nice forward nose of sour cherry with bits of very subtle anise and pepper underneath. Plenty of tart pucker but in a fun, light, refreshing way. More like a sour pop than a gueuze--and that’s no knock against the beer, it’s just not a viciously sour one. Creamy medium body with plenty of carbonation and a bit of graininess showing against the tongue as well. Dark pitted tree fruit dominates, of course--cherry to be sure, and bits of currant and nectarine feel like they’re just around the corner. Tiniest hints of baking spice. Plenty of refreshing sour to it, but a bit too sweet to be a sour for noon on a hot summer day. More of a four seasons sour, and that’s much to its credit. Sounds like a weird metaphor, given that it’s brewed and named in observance of old Christmas traditions, but there it is. Beautifully complex and eminently drinkable. Another triumph from Cascade.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

This beer will be exclusively on tap at the Holiday Ale Fest in Portland, do not miss this beer.  I feel honored to have tried this awesome double sour with bing cherries.  Pours reddish with a tan head.  Nose is huge with lots of cherries and a nice tart edge.  Taste is wonderful.  Big sour tart cherries.  very nice and very well balanced.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
