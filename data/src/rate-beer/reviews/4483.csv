4483,"2017-02-12",3.7,"Pours like semi-viscous motor oil, utterly black, utterly headless. Sweet alcohol, vinous, fortified wine, black raisins, dried plums, molasses or concentrated reedsugarsyrup. And an overlying aroma of cinnamon, bit volatile. Not overly sweet, even quite a bit of bitterish woodiness. Again (dried) dark fruit, spirit or fortified wine, Marssala, liqueur. Warming up, the sweetness takes over again. Syrupy feel, thick/oily but alcoholthinning all the same. No carbonation to speak of. Alcoholheat. Well... as to be expected seen the specs. Fiery stuff.  Thanks for sharing, guys!","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

Flat, warming, oily; Decent, definitely better than expected, still not that great, crude, fun for what it is, simple, liked even though it isnt super or anything. A fun one for a small amount.

4483,"2016-04-13",4.0,"Bottle shared by martjoobolut, massive thanks! A beautiful 20 cl flip-top bottle. BB 2025. Poured reddish coke brown with no head. Very thick, very heavy, sludgy - almost managing to hide the 19%. I mean its not hidden but rather restrained. Love the base of this, the vinous, cocoa, roast of the Stout. Loved it, possibly among the most memorable beers Ive ever had. Thanks again! Im so going to overrate it without even caring.

I think Tools ""Ænima"" was playing when we had it, but Melvins wouldve probably been more appropriate, e.g. their ""10 Songs"".","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"
