663,"2017-03-01",4.5,"Bottle vintage 2016, label says nothing about alcohol content (legal?). Nose huge chocolate, wood, soy sauce, murky-inky and lightly aged but inviting. Pour beautiful dark brown with tawny and ruby and amber highlights, head is sudsy tan. Taste extremely rich in malt, British yeast leaving its fruity ester fingerprints all over, alcohol is bracing but clean and medium-warming, very classy, and there are waves of brown sugar and molasses throughout, gearing up to strong treacle by the finish. On the whole only lightly sweet and thats densely embedded, with a smooth and clean light bitterness that rounds. Light body but not watery, minimally fizzy, light vanilla (certainly not overdoing it on the barrel character, which is a major plus), several shades of caramel with sherry and very faintly oxidized notes, yet still tastes very fresh, even a tad young for service. Earthy, leathery, lighter cherry and red berry, plummy and grape even further back than that, slight tobacco, lightly oily, hint of smoke but I have to look for it. Wonderful complexity and a legit big boy, delighted to have gone in blind. [2017.03.01: 4.5]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
663,"2017-02-18",4.6,"Poured into a thistle, the appearance was a dark brown close to black in color with a thin off white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Filmy lace graces the sides nicely.
The aroma takes on big sweet malty cues of caramel, toffee, butterscotch, milk chocolate, smoke, peat, vanilla, dry woodiness all coming together eloquently and so smooth.
The flavor melds all of those previously mentioned aromas in sweet dry fashion leading with the vanilla, wood and peat. Subtle woody to earthy to peaty aftertaste. Herbal/peaty and vanilla to woody sticky finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a pure peaty stickiness as it should be and without any cloying-ness. Low carbonation with an exceptional herbal/peaty smoothness rolling over my tongue.
Overall, scotch ale, damn straight! Barrel aged, well damn well it is! Perfect for a cold winters night in Vermont.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, vanilla, brown sugar, bourbon, toasted oak, brown bread, raisin, prune, plum, fig, cherry, and date; with lighter notes of chocolate, nuttiness, peat smoke, leather, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness.

Minimal bourbon/oak dryness. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, fairly silky, and lightly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great.

663,"2016-08-11",3.4,"12 ounce bottle from Trigs in Wausau, WI (August 2016), served a little below cellar temperature from a Maudite glass. Completely opaque molasses color, with a smallish caramel head that recedes to a lasting ring and faint cover...aroma is, initially, all about the bourbon-vanilla-oak notes, with deeper notes of caramelized malt and pine tar emerging slowly...body is dryer and more bitter than Id expected, with strong roasted malts and pretty fair alcohol presence reminding me more of a drier Imperial Stout than a Scotch, at least at first...on a couple more sips, a softer and more rounded underlying character emerges, more caramel malts and perhaps a little smoothness from the aging...medium-bodied for the style, pretty low carbonation...all in all its not bad, but I do think its harsher and more brash than most examples Ive had, and probably the least-sweet Scotch that I can remember...mixed feelings ultimately; I think I will probably put a couple of bottles away and see if 6 months or a year makes a difference and mellows this tough bastard out a bit.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

The taste follows the nose, with very little hoppy bitterness and lots of caramel and bourbon sweetness carrying through from start to finish. There is some very nice alcohol warming in the finish, but God only knows how much alcohol really exists within the mystery ABV of this beer. There is no notation of the alcohol content of this beer on the labeling, the packaging, rate beer, or any website that I could find. That notwithstanding, this is one of the best scotch ales that I have had (and I have had a lot of great ones!) This rivals, if not eclipses, Ale Smith's Bourbon barrel aged Wee Heavy.

Taste is really smooth malt, with bourbon and whiskey integrating perfectly with a big malty, peaty scotch ale. Finishes warm, sweet, and lightly boozy. Medium-bodied with smooth carbonation. Surprised at how good this was.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

A beauty.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jstraw"
663,"2013-09-26",4.3,"Pours a very dark brown, almost black. Very small, effervescent mocha head. A ton of sediment. Nose smells almost identical to a quad. Bourbon is present, but its very subtle. A lot of dark fruits. Raisin, fig, licorice, caramel, cloves. Very malty. Mouth is awesome. The bourbon definitely shines through on the tongue. A decent amount of bitterness. I get a lot of espresso. Very dark as well. Some cherry and raisin play a role here. Despite the bourbon, theres is almost no burn. Its very smooth.","Batavia, Illinois, USA","Tortman18"
663,"2013-09-21",4.2,"September 21, 2013 - bottle from AV3. Dark brown pour with some head and spotty lacing. This really foamed up nicely with a gentle swirl and noticeable sediment primarily towards the bottom of the glass. Aroma was bourbon, caramel and malt. Taste was malty and sweet initially, then some bourbon heat comes in, but is quickly replaced with vanilla. Finish had a touch of heat and alcohol, though not the nice bourbon flavor from earlier. Smooth to drink and medium to full bodied.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"

663,"2013-09-18",4.1,"Pours opaque brown/black with a tan head. Smells definitively of bourbon, with some underlying chocolate and a very light touch of smoke. Flavor is more clearly a scotch ale. Dark malt, both smoky and caramelicious, with a bit of vanilla. Woody, oaky smoke comes back in the finish, which is long and satisfying. Thick body.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"
663,"2013-09-12",4.2,"12 oz. bottle. Pours dark copper, but looks black once in glass with a quick tight khaki head that fades to a wispy film and thin collar.

663,"2013-09-10",4.1,"Fresh 2013 vintage, with thanks to Brent, Fitz, crossovert and the Chicago tasting crew. Pours a viscous mahogani with latte foam. Fresh scotch caramels and dark sugars turned into rich and smooth vinous bourbon-ale. Being fresh, most aromas are upfront and in line with the taste, dominated by the bourbon cask and underlying scotch malt richness: not heavy on layered complexity, but delicious with the advertised elements, uplifted by a light red wine fruitiness.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

Lovely brew.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
663,"2013-09-04",4.1,"Bottle. Aroma if bourbon (whoa alcohol), dark fruits (cherry, dates, plums), toffee, vanilla. Dark brown, opaque, minimal head. Taste: smoky, rich, smooth, dark-fruit bourbon. Damn this is good. Sweet (as expected for style). Palate: slick, syrupy viscous, full body and soft carbonation. Overall: this is really damned good. Like drinking a bourbon, port, beer cocktail. Wish I brought home more than one bottle.

663,"2013-09-01",4.1,"Bottle thanks to Weinando! Dark brown pour, a little lacing and an aroma of cherry wood and bourbon.

663,"2013-08-20",4.3,"Pours a very deep brown with a medium, creamy, long lasting, light tan head. The aroma consists a high degree of vanilla and whiskey, some coconut, with caramel and mild butterscotch undertones. Its really intriguing. The taste is a bit sweet, but not much. This one is still big on whiskey and vanilla. Some lighter caramel as well. Aftertaste remains the same as the taste, although it is short. Medium to full in body, creamy in texture, with soft carbonation. I get the feeling this is stronger, as the alcohol seems to be getting noticeable after just a few sips. The impressions of vanilla and whiskey are very extreme in here. This one is very easy to enjoy if you like both of these flavors. I do, and this is a great beer.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"
663,"2013-08-19",3.8,"Draft at The Old Fashioned, then again at Greenbush Bar. Pours a deep amber-brown with a finger of beige head that softly rests atop the beer before eventually settling into a ring. Notes of vanilla, bourbon, oak, and abundant sweet and toasty malts. Hint of dark fruit. Medium-bodied, with a toasty, malty, sticky mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Nice bourbon barrel Scotch ale; sweet and malty.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

663,"2007-08-21",4.0,"On draught at the brewpub in Marshfield, Wisconsin. Pours a clear cola brown brew with a creamy off-white head that slowly dissolves to a white ring with excellent lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, toffee, distinct brown sugar, licorice and coconut. Taste is medium to full bodied, hardly any carbonation with flavors of caramel malt with bourbon and coconut.

663,"2007-08-05",3.8,"Central Waters does a bourbon barrel version of half their line-up (and usually intensely bourbony), which is great, because I love anything barrel-aged, but not so great in that many of them start to taste similar.  Still, this was very good, and different enough.  Big bourbon aroma and taste, with some backtaste of almost buttery caramel and a sweet nuttiness.  Hard to identify this as a Scotch ale  but well call that an example of creativity.  Recommended.","Hartland, Wisconsin, USA","Flyer"

663,"2006-08-23",3.4,"On tap at the Great Taste of the Midwest.  Poured an ugly, murky brown with loose bubbles for head.  Nose was heavy on the sweet bourbon with lesser notes of smoked peat, fresh caramel, and mild spices.  Flavor also carried through a large amount of bourbon, but the other components provided sufficient goodness to keep it interesting (caramel, toffee, smoked peat, chocolate)... Just felt OK on the palate... a tad on the flat side and nothing memorable.  I would love to see this bottled.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
663,"2006-08-14",3.7,"Tap @ GTMW 2006.  Ruddy and muddy chestnut in color with a few bubbles to form a rung around the edges.  Theres no mistaking the bourbon prevalence in the nose, as its met with single malt scotch and a background peat presence.  Tollhouse caramel & chocolate chip cookies are aromatically hinted at, and then they get the shit smashed out of them with bourbon.  Flavor moves the bourbon aspects into a whisky & rye spin and portrays buttery butterscotch to-a-tee.  Toffee bark imparts an omnipresent characteristic to the whisky current.  Medium-bodied with a touch of tannic and acidic activity.  Chocolate toffee cubes get chased with hazelnut flavored whisky.  Turned down carbonation lets the flavors play out, but it also publicizes a touch of searing acidity.  Peat and scorched caramelized sugars meet up with buttery, bourbon laden butterscotches in the end.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
