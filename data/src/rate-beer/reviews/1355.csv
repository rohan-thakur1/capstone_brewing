1355,"2017-02-11",4.0,"Cask, gravity from, Scurreria, Genova, Italy, Friday 10th February 2017   This beer is just plonked on the bar in a small cask (pin) and has just been tapped, how fab. Crystal clear chestnut brown with a light filmy head. Quite nutty, biscuity, caramel topped biscuity loveliness, soft maltiness. This is not a hop monster, its not a big Impy Stout, its not a sour mouth zapper in fact in many respects its not a million miles from the sort of beer that Id have been drinking when I started out. Its just a real pleasant, session drinking beer, its so easy drinking, its bloody lovely and quite the opposite from the hop monster Id just had, blah, blah.......anyway thats enough of the beer, great though it was.  

So this is my 10,000 beer but lets face it, its not really is it, there are plenty of beers Ive had which Ive forgotten to rate or which the brewers details are so obscure that I cannot add them, this is merely the beer that sits at 10k. Anyhow enough of that were in Scurreria the best pub in Genova chatting with Giorgio the joint owner about all things beery and would you believe it he knows Angelo (Moncada) from a big night out in London ten years ago drinking Crouch Vale Brewers Gold and then crashing at his flat in a drunken state, and it got me thinking just how this beer world we inhabit works, its a small world, and by and large its a very friendly world, and you get chatting to folk and there are so many connections. I was less bothered about what beer Id have to hit 10k and more concerned about where Id have it, so sitting here felt just right. The folk on this site mean a lot to me and so I want to thank you all. I did start writing everyones name down but then felt a bit panicky in case I missed anyone. So many thanks to all of you and hope to see you soon, Ill stop now before it sounds like a twatty Oscars speech.  A7 A5 T8 P4 Ov16 4.0","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"

1355,"2016-03-13",4.2,"Gravity barrel during numerous sessions @ Brauerei Gradl in Nov. 2015: Clear rusty-chestnut. Lathery foam exhibits stellar retention. Captivatingly malt-rich aromas of breadcrust, hazelnut and sassafras entice the olfactory along with pistachio- and buttermilk-like yeast, fallen leaves, minerals and an orangey fruitiness. Soft, fine, weightless carbonation. Stunningly dry, yet extraordinarily rich breadcrusty malt  fuses with an earthy mixture of bitter pecan skin and fallen-leaf hoppiness. Sharply herbal and woody, but well-integrated, punch of hops lends a drying effect and resonates nicely with the prominent earthy flavors. Bracing minerals clutch the tongue and amplify the licoricey hops. Oodles of marzipan, nougat and unsweetened chocolate drip from the complex malt. Some coffee, cookie and burnt toffee buried in there as well. Envelope-pushing bitterness soaks up the saliva produced by the explosive malt and rich minerals. Melanoidins flourish and satiate in the sublimely malty, yet immaculately clean, finish as chewy-bitter hops and vivid minerals provide contrast and singularity. As unabashed malt and mineral bomb that gives the fullest expression of terroir. So lean and clean, and easily the finest water quality I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing!  Multiple liters of this will purify ones soul.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Aroma of margerine/buttered breadcrust, inviting fresh proteins and roast caramels. Flavourwise, a masterpiece in below-5% balance and earthy richness with a mineral edge: starts off bready and toasted, with hints of young chestnut, before an assertive hop bitterness takes over leading into a greenhop-bitter finish: ""soggy pasture"", wet grass, more young/green chestnut bitters and flower stems over dry caramels, then a distinct (rusty) iron and thaw water touch, as picked up on by earlier raters. - Particularly moreish in all forms, due to the nectar-like natural carbonation linking Franconian Keller with Real Ale, and high bitterness. - Hard to find in DE, yet worth the hike to the source to have this tapped by the gruffy questionmark of a senior brewer - or to the discerning bars in Sweden and Italy who impressively carry this on cask.

1355,"2014-10-17",4.9,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2017 My Bottom Line:
This otherwordly Dunkel develops toasted chestnuts, raisins, oranges and light caramel, an expertly-developed malt profile juxtaposed to salient herbal hop bitterness. When this brew is on, its one of the best in Franconia, no doubt.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam stays atop the shiny darkness. This is unfiltered, but it has dropped clear beautifully.
-The mouthfeel is ever-so-creamy and, more importantly, süffig.
-The finish on this one is endless. Looooong toasted maltiness... And hop bitterness. The dosage is so perfect you never get overwhelmed by it either.
-The flavor profile is mesmerizing once youve gotten round taming it.
-The bottled version isnt as cushy and süffig, as can be expected (gravity barrel cant be beat for low gravity beers), but it still delivers a really flavorful memento of the evenings spent at Gradls brauereigasthof.
