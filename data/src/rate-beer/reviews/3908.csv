3908,"2017-05-02",3.7,"Bottle (330 ml) at home, split 2-ways. Thanks to hackobock for this bottle! Clear pale salmon color with no head or lacing. Aroma is a strange beast here with the raspberries being much more subdued than in the regular version... cinnamon is strong, vanilla too but a bit less and the raspberries are still there but transformed by the barrel-aging I guess. Taste is gently tart and the ingredients are coming together more harmoniously than the aroma a bit... again theres cinnamon, vanilla, tart raspberries and oaky notes, theres also lactic/yogurt notes but less than in the regular version. Light body. Soft carbonation. A bit oaky mouthfeel. Cinnamon and vanilla finish with some lingering tart raspberries. Its unique no doubt about it but I prefer the raspberry burst and the drinkability from the regular version. It was fun to try though!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
