3211,"2017-05-29",1.0,"This beer is a shame for Hop Valley. For a great lager beer, look for craft brewers making many legitimate styles of lager. Look for styles labelled Helles, Pilsner and Vienna Lager, Bock and Swarzbier. Look for brewers called Heater Allen, and pFriem from Oregon, and many more thru the U.S. A beer labelled lager is akin to a beer labelled ale. I love Hop Valley but this beer doesnt fit any accepted style of lager.lightly sour, thin feel, soft carbonation, bread, barnyard, dough,","","lagerproponent"

3211,"2017-04-27",2.8,"Can from Biernavigatie. Aroma is grainy malt, rice, fruity notes with citrus and peach, bit soapy, soda, hint of hops. Flavour is light sweet and bitter. Body is light and watery. Not a bad Pale Lager, easy drink and refreshing, just dont care much for the added rice.","Steenwijk, NETHERLANDS","tricksta_p"
3211,"2017-04-15",2.8,"Unlike most pale lagers, this doesnt smell terrible. A slight pilsener feel, but also a bit rice flavored. Its okay. Good for the style and for the less adventurous beer drinker.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
3211,"2017-03-29",4.2,"Clear crisp golden hue with a thin white ring of foam. Brisk leafy grassy hop nose with a lovey clean pale golden malty base with a lagered biscuity note. Crisp flavor thats basic and biscuity and pale German malty but with a crisp vibrant grassy and leafy hop note thats super tastes and lightly bitter while still being clean and bright and classical. Amazing pils.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

Slightly cloudy yellow golden color with a small white head. 
Honey, sweetness, soda and sima in the aroma.

Low carbonation. Simple brew.","Tampere, FINLAND","rosenbergh"
3211,"2016-09-11",2.9,"A top 40 pale lager that actually drinks like a pale lager. Sweet grain on the nose and up front on the palate with a crisp body and very light floral hop presence. Good for that it is, and deserving of its style numbers maybe, but still a pale lager. Can.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
3211,"2016-07-30",2.4,"Can from Total Wine in Sacramento, CA. Pours gold with a white head. Grainy aroma with minimal hop. Not quite med body. Grainy flavor - not much hop - and the flavor turns rather unpleasant. In a blind tasting Id likely identify it as Bud - tho that may be unfair since I havent tasted Bud in many, many years. Anyway - DP.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
3211,"2016-07-14",3.1,"16 ounce can. 7.25 for 6. Pours a clear yellow color with a medium white head. A light grainy sweet nose. The flavor is grassy, toast, very light. A bit of metal.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
3211,"2016-06-26",3.2,"Pours two fingers of head on a clear straw body.
Aroma is clean, dry grains.
Taste is mild sweet and a touch of bitter. Easy but nice flavor.
Texture is crisp.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"
3211,"2016-05-26",3.5,"This can was shared with Strykzone on Facebook Chat. I Poured yellow with a white head. Light lacing. Nose of lemon and grassy hops, Medium body and a smooth lager mouth feel Flavor is lemon and grass, and the finish is slightly sweet and shows the lemon again. This would be as Dave suggested a great beer for a float trip being in a can and of low ABV,","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
3211,"2016-05-26",3.5,"Pint can from hayduke that we had together via facebook chat. A one plus finger of white foam. The beer is lightly hazy yellow gold. Lemon in the aroma. It might even have some meringue in it. Lemon is also tasted along with pale pasty malts and light earth. Gentle fruit. The lemon leads. A pleasant beer. It would be a great float trip beer.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
3211,"2016-04-15",3.6,"Can. Pours golden with thick off-white head. Aroma is sweet with malt hints. Taste is sweet and very light. Id call it a lawn mower beer. Its actually very good for a lager as its not usually my thing.","Colorado, USA","blueshockey24"
3211,"2016-02-29",3.5,"Hints of lemon wood and floral scents. Lovely bright yellow slightly cloudy color. Nice lager malt taste with hues of lemon and honey. Light body with light smooth carbonation.

3211,"2015-12-28",3.3,"Can. 

Given my general admiration for Hop Valley, I wanted to try this even though its not my usual style. It was thin at first sip, without the hop bite I like in a pils -- but as I accept it for what it is, its a very easy drinking light lager with almost honey-like touch that I find very pleasant. Impressive at <4 ABV.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
3211,"2015-10-02",3.4,"16 oz. can from Beercraft. It pours a clear pale golden color with a fizzy white head. The aroma is full with rice water, pale malts, light citrus and earthy hops. Little florals. The flavor is the same. Nice and clean with some rice, pale malt, light florals and a hint of lime. My can said 4% ABV, but either way is is totally crushable. No off flavors. Not too exciting, but a great light pale lager.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3211,"2015-09-10",3.1,"Pours yellow with a small white head. Grass, grain, floral and light hop aroma. Lemongrass, rice, floral hop and biscuit flavors. Light body and average carbonation.","California, USA","beertholomeus"

3211,"2015-08-24",3.2,"Canned (4%) from Plaid Pantry. Grainy with some corn notes up front. A decent amount of maltiness. A light hoppiness in the finish with a bit more grains and malts. They nailed a pretty good light lager. A lot of flavors remind me of a light beer, but they are a cut above the swill.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
3211,"2015-08-13",3.1,"Tap.

A: Clear straw strafed with bubbles. Foamy white head.

N: Grist, white grape, grain, earth, straw, white peppercorn. Hints of white peach.

T: Lightly sweet and a touch bitter. Not too much flavor like in the nose.

M: Light body, fizzy carbonation, no alcohol.

O: Simple lager with a really nice fruit nose. If it carried through the palate, I would rave.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
3211,"2015-08-02",2.6,"16 oz can poured. Key word here is light. Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a thin oily head. Corn heavy aroma with a bit of sweetness. Flavor is a little sweet up front but heavy on the corn late. Hop Valley Light. Less my type of beer, but this could have been a lot worse.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
