1836,"2015-07-15",4.0,"Draught at Deep Ellum, 7/10/15.Very cool to see this guy on tap in the States! A lovely peachy-apricot color with some darker coppers, qood clarity and a white head that is large and slowly fades to cover.Minerals, flowers and ""sweat"" in the nose; not sure if this is malt-based, hop-based or a combination of the two, but its actually quite interesting. Gives it a real rustic flare and helps bridge the lightly bitter hops and the lightly sweet malts (light biscuits, stale cookies, light sourdough). A touch of metal in the nose as well, though light and almost more seltzer/mineral-like. Medium strength of aroma and no alcohol noted.Different in the flavor, quite unexpectedly and enjoyably so. The malts, while still nicely rich and well-extracted, are quite dry and allow a significantly bitter hop flavor to show through, certainly balancing and even tipping the balance scales to much more hop/bitterness-forward. Its lovely and refreshing (in both senses of the word) and with the ample but not overdone carbonation and soft, but ever-present malts, it goes down easy, but still provides a bock-like experience. Straw, heavily spicy hop notes and touches of both sourdough and honey linger delightfully.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1836,"2003-05-24",3.9,"Great deep golden color, but full white head retention could be better.  Deep Munich malt aroma w/ some grainy, toasty, & raisiny aromas present.  Flavor is malty, malty, malty and lightly toasty;  a little nutty as well; no hop flavor, very well balanced w/ a dry finish and a malty aftertaste.  Medium body w/ moderate carbonation and slightly dry, not astringent m/f.  Pretty much everything I'd expect from a maibock...very malty and drinkable.  It would be a staple in my fridge except for the fact that it is not (or should not be)available all year 'round.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"
1836,"2003-04-28",4.0,"Cloudy body under frothy disapating head.  Aroma of fat, rich malt.  The flavor is brilliant, huge, sweet, Germanic pale malt.  None of the hops you find in Einbecker: this is simply a tribute to what tremendous amounts of pale malt can produce.  What an unforgettable experience.  And I thank Hopsrus for it.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"
1836,"2003-04-07",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2003 Malty sweet aroma. Orangish color, slightly cloudy.  Tasty bock, sweet with a taste that is similiar to aroma.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"

1836,"2002-09-24",4.1,"One of the better bocks around. Decent head and color. Plenty of malt is an understatement. This beer is extremely malty without going over the top, the sweetness is a pleasent offset from the malt.","Maryland, USA","morty99"
1836,"2002-09-01",4.2,"i gotta concur with the raving raters here, this is a true ""GFB"" (great f*ckin beer). deceptively plain-jane lager yellow with a modest peach fuzz head. a thing of beauty is revealed in the aroma, however, splendid malty pretzel and subtle dark fruits. im not a taster who lauds the ""masking"" of alcohol: bring it on, i say. like in a good scotch, its a powerful attribute i love in the stronger beers. this sweet maibock is a 1000 watt-amped oktoberfest. another doppelquaffer from ayinger.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"
1836,"2002-08-17",3.2,"All these beers look the same.  Good thing they taste differently, otherwise Id be suspect of Ayinger.  This one is above average. Sweetly malty.","Westerville, Ohio, USA","Panzuriel"

1836,"2002-07-25",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2003 An absolutely delicious and oddly unusual beer!  This may well be the best damn Ayinger beer I've had yet.  Gorgeous looking and surprisingly sweet.  I MUST have this again.
RERATE: Sweetness hides the alcohol content extremely well.  Once again, stellar!  Thanks Hopsrus.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"

1836,"2001-11-13",4.6,"Astonishing.  Incredibly gorgeous to look at, with a wonderful solid-gold medium body and rich-looking cream-colored head.  The aroma is incredible, I cant begin to describe it, full of malt and acidic fruit flavors; and the flavor is almost too much on top of that.  Ultra-malty, as malty as the Optimator I had yesterday, but with just a bit of lightness and fruitiness to keep it from being too heavy; and alcohol is nowhere present.  Perhaps too quick a finish, but a world-class beer from a world-class brewere nonetheless.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1836,"2001-10-16",3.2,"Good aroma but not a multi-dimensional taste. Frankly, it just sits there. All right, but there are better light bocks out there.","LaVista, Nebraska, USA","K-V-F-L"

1836,"2001-08-08",4.3,"As pale bocks go, this is wonderful.  Malt is VERY strong in both aroma and flavor, and ever so slightly sweet.  Nice honey color.  My appreciation for Ayingers offerings continues to grow; their weissbiers are possibly my favorites in that style (even after visiting Mu:nchen and trying quite a few), and who can deny the quality of their Celebrator doppelbock?  The Maibock is a winner as well...its hard to imagine it being much better than this, at least for what I look for in pale bocks (bearing in mind that I am partial to ales, not lagers).  Note: my numeric ratings are compared ONLY to other pale bocks.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

questionable age.   Plenty of those
bocky toffeish toasty flavors.  Malty sweet
in the nose and palate.  A bit fizzy - full bodied.
Pale bronze color.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

sweet for my tastes.  Otherwise a very nice malt flavor.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","scrawfis"
1836,"2001-02-13",4.1,"Saw the comments and had to try it!  This brew has a very sweet, floral nose, and a beautiful golden color, a bit unusual for the bocks Ive had.  Fizzes to a velvet when swished in the mouth.  The aroma stays with you minutes after each sip.  Very good indeed.","Ohio, USA","cartel99"
1836,"2001-01-23",4.3,"I loved this stuff.  Had a strong maltiness, with a good balanced aftertaste.  I probably poured this a bit too cold, as it got better as it warmed up.  Id recommend cellat temperatures at most for this one.  Also, this reminded me a lot of some Samuel Smiths brews, but being $1.30 cheaper, Id much rather go for this.  A must try.","Portland, Maine, USA","Sammys"
1836,"2000-11-27",4.5,"This is a perfect maibock in my ever so humble opinion.  Very malty, smooth, and while its straw color seems innocent, this stuff packs a bit of a punch.  A great beer.  I think this is a good gateway beer, one to get drinkers of Budmilloors into better beer.","Sandy, Utah, USA","opiate"
