140,"2015-04-21",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2015 2 oz sample from bottle (200 ml). Harvest 2008. 

Appearance: Bright orangey-golden with some legs. 

Aroma: Mild. Pears, floral honey-like notes, yellow apples and mild caramel presence.

Taste: Nice balance between acidity and sweetness, both are at a relatively low level for an ice cider. Pears, yellow apples, oak and mild caramel presence. Almost no spiciness, which is rare in ice ciders. 

Palate: Medium body. Quite oaky. Pear finish. Mild warming finish.

Overall: Very good Ice Cider. This one is all about balance, which isnt too surprising considering its a blend of wort made from cryoconcentration and from cryoextraction. It also has a yellow (pears, apples) profile. Alcohol is well hidden. Quite easy drinking for an ice cider. Nice oaky features.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

140,"2014-09-14",4.5,"> Incredible, underrated ice cider masterpiece with tannic barrel character 
[ Bottle ][ 375mL ][ Cidrerie du Minot ][ $25-30 ][ La Face Cachee Neige Stemware ][ 9.14.14 ]
>> Pours clear, brilliant orange gold with excellent cognac legs. Nose is melted cheese atop baked apple pie. Whipped cream, spiced pear, pie crust. Taste is that awesome dichotomy of sweet sugary and acidic. Yellow apple, white sugar, apple skins, fruit juice acid. This one also has quite a hefty amount of wooden barrel character- quite tannic, but it isnt wooly or astringent. Long, acidic palate. Again, I will tell you, every ice cidery in Quebec is world class. Not just La Face Cachee. They are top rated only because they are the easiest to find. Endlessly enjoyable, thoroughly loved by the group I shared it with.

Fresh ripe whole grapes with crisp pinot grigio and sauvignon grape juices in the middle and dry slightly bitter and cleansing in the end. Honeydew in the finish. Homemade apple concentrate. Has a presence of being naturally chilled  like the end of Fall and the coming of Winter.

I detect some floral notes, but only distantly.  Flavor is very nice, sweet rich, slightly spicy, warming alcohol.  I could have used a touch more acidity, but this is yet another great cider from Quebec.","Saint Cloud, Florida, USA","CheesedMan"
140,"2007-09-27",3.8,"Deep, soft, melting golden pour. Incredibly high visible density results in very thick, super-slowly forming legs that barely succeed in a trickle down to the liquid from which they originated. Moderate, firey residual sugars with a soft white pepper hint waft from a nose of sticky apple nectar. Light caramel and spicy mineralic tinting add complexity. Appleskin notes, along with cherry and orange blossom waters highlight subtle complexities. A cinnamon-based, diluted, spicy potpourri-inflected offshoot of the nose lingers after each inhalation. Alcohol is only moderately apparent. What would seem average at first glance does have admirable variances and obvious craftsmanship behind it. The flavor is tremendous! A step up/forward, in the right direction. A twist of classic intersects with new spice excitement to create something that will endure with a fervor for at least a short while in the catacoms of memory. Sweetness is very high -not cloying, but quenching and complex, with toppling acidity that keeps appleskins vibrant and tartness from fleeting. The finish is sweet,fruity and highly acidic, but settles down and fades very, very slowly. There is a bit too much warmth going down, ouch. Other than excessive ethanol in the finale, this stuff is great. The mouthfeel is syrupy without feeling cloying or too sugary, gets stuck in the back of the mouth and drips down the throat due to an incredibly tightly woven molecular structure and consistency unrivaled in this category of beverage. Very full bodied, smooth and lightly prickly. I love me some ice cider.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
