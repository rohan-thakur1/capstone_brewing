Nice beer but its a bit too soapy, not bothered about the red wine ageing. In fact if truth be known I am both underwhelmed and a little disappointed in this. .

Smells a lot like Brown Brothers Tarrango, which is a very good thing. Some blackcurrant. Some ripe raspberry. Taste is tangy, fruity and sweet, firstly, turning dry, and woody bitter. Bretty, juicy mouthfeel. Drinks well under the ABV. Tangy, raspberry fruitiness on the finish. Its like a wine barrel aged Orval. Stunningly good.","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"

Taste is all gueze, farmhouse ale, raspberries with a bit of bark/tannin in the back. What a fantastic beer! I could swear I was in La Becassr in Brussels. Cloudwater rock.","SCOTLAND","Heidbummer"

2048,"2016-05-02",3.6,"(Thx!) Sampled draft @ Tilquin English Beer Festival 2016. Hazy light golden, off-white head. Nose is weird sour herbs, strongly vinous, vinegar touch & odd metallic note.

2048,"2016-05-02",3.7,"Draft @ Tilquin English Fest 16, courtesy of and shared with the fine Belgian RB crew. 
Orangée, col crémeux blanc-cassé.
Arôme au nez boisé, vin rouge, rétro de grains avec un léger bouquet fruité-citronné de houblons nobles, mais aussi de levure sauvage type brett,
Palais est malté, avec un léger côté vin rouge et pointe de barrique-chêne. Houblonné citronnée arrive en retrait et accompagne un malt léger malté caramel sur note poudreuse. Reste correcte si on peu imaginer le tout sans être apparenté au style Picard de Garde. Ici, les levures brett, je suppose, rendent un peu le tout moins naturel que si lapproche française avait été préférée.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
