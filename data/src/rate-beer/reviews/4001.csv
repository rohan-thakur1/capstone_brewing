A: Pours a very dark near-black, with some brownish/ruby highlights and a tan foam head that settles to a thin cap and splotchy lacework.
T: Delicate but successful balance between the hops and malts. Nice and hoppy with a fair amount of sweetness. There is also a strong amount of chocolate and roast with a equally as strong amount of hops. 
P: Medium in body and moderate carbonation.

In long: The intense nose is resinous hops, black liquorice, pan-fried hazelnuts.
Taste is fudge nougat, cashews, highly resinous leafy hops, toasted beach wood sensation, fruity notes of grapes, forest floor, tree sap, green pine needles, vanilla, grapefruits, tobacco.  Very sticky bitterness.  Full body with a medium carbonation. Lots of things happening here, this is a tasty beer for sure and a style I like, but I found this one a bit too sticky, good but not very good.  Still drinking the full bomber was rather easy, and I love to enter a rating for a strong beer and say I drank the whole bottle by myself, just to show-off how badass I am, and then I go take a nice long bubble bath.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4001,"2012-12-07",3.8,"66cl bottle from Toftvin. No BBD. Pours black with medium tan head. Some retention and decent lace. Aroma is floral hops and the starchy character remniscient of black IPAs.

Flavour is well-balanced between the roasted malt and hops, perhaps more on the sweet side for an Imperial Black IPA, with caramel and roasted malt upfront, with a healthy hop dose in back. Sweet, roasty finish, without any astringency. Light-to-medium bodied for the style, without any harshness. Good stuff, but overrated I feel.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

The flavor is exactly what you would expect from the aroma; chocolate, pine, and citrus.  The alcohol is a bit more present than in other Black IPAs I have had with similar ABV percentages (Sublimely Self Righteous and Uinta Dubhe come to mind).

Interesting and tasty flavor blend prior to a bitter nut flavor taking over further down in the glass. Very chewy. Finishes with a lot of bittersweetness; citrus, coffee, some chocolate and that bitter nut. Strong flavor palate and a really tasty brew.

4001,"2012-07-28",3.3,"A three-way vertical between Lakefront IBA (India-Style Black Ale), Three Heads Skunk Black IPA, and Hoppin Frog Hop Heathen Imperial Black Ale.  Bottle and served in one of my numerous Duvel snifters: Appearance: All three have basically the same color, very deep brown nearly opaque. The difference is head retention with the Three Heads maintaining a fluffy head and producing the best lacework (5). The Lakefront had a slight better head and spotty lace (3) versus the Hop Hopping Frog which left almost no lace on the glassware (2).  The nose: Resiny, bile, oniony hops with some pale chocolate and roast for the Lakefront. Juicy, grassy, piney and a tad faint hop with a dusty roasted malt note for the Skunk. The Hop Heathen is most unique for sure with a grapefruity, piney and smoky earthy malt vapour. Almost meaty and oh so earthy. I love the aroma of the Hopping Frog (9), while the Three Heads is tame and weak but not offensive (7) and the Lakefront has the oniony, garlic, and catty overtones I do not care much for (5).  The taste profiles: We start with the Hop Heathen this time and I get quite a bit of heavy resin, pine sap, and some of the catty high alpha notes that were much more noticeable on the aroma of the Lakefront. There is a nice roasted and slight smoked, leathery, tobacco, liquorice undertones as well for the Hoppin Frog. It is complex for the genre, perhaps too much so. (7). The Skunk has more a basic fruity, piney, and cardboardy taste. Much like the aroma this beer is tame and weak compared to the other two. Even the finish is far too short (5). The Lakefront has a nice bitterness but is still not quite as aggressive as I would like, a bit too malty (but not sweet). Coffee and earth are pronounced with this beer. (6) Mouth feel/Palate: Start with the Three Heads Shunk this time: Lively enough, too much (which explains the lasting head), over carbonated, thin, ashy, short. Not all that good (2) The HFHHIBA (haha) is aggressive, biting, a tad boozy, and a tad medicinal. This one suffers from being the one that is a tad under-carbonated. (3). Then there is the Lakefront IBA which a bit thin and a bit over carbonated as well. There is a minerally and metallic quality about this I found a bit off-putting (2). Wow, NONE OF THESE are clean nor properly carbonated, either over or under. All have major flaws on the palate IMO. <insert sad face emotion here>:  Final Verdict: None of the beers are something I would buy again. Each failed to meet expectations. Each are classic examples of when a brewer attempts the ""next big thing"" without a clue on what they are doing.  (Remind me not to but a Berliner Weiss from any of these three breweries.).

This particular black IPA was not my cup of tea but is still a fine beer. It wasnt difficult to finish off the bottle despite it being filling and a little heavy by the end. Dont let this one sit around - drink it fresh and enjoy a superb experiment.

Aroma / Appearance - The inky black fluid pour clings to the sides of the glass. A billowing musty brown head looks like a pile of dead leaves that have crumbled into dust. Anise, chocolate, spruce, and resin spark the inner hophead.

Flavor / Palate - The resin manifests itself immediately in the form of a piney bite. Dark high quality chocolate and anise rise up before a soft feel of ethanol infuses the palate in warmth. The last experience is of a bitter finish that sticks on the back of the throat. I cant wait to try the new Goose Juice and see if Hoppin Frog can carry their momentum to another gem.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

4001,"2012-06-10",4.6,"Pours a murky, muddy dark brown with some milk chocolate highlights when held up to the light. It almost appears gritty. A careful pour results into a modest two finger creamy tan head with moderate lacing. Not the worlds prettiest beer but thats not the point.

This is one of those beers that captures your attention right away based on the wafting aromas present during the initial pour. Its one of the most complex noses Ive come across. Waves of subtle pine interplay with a more complex aroma of a bright, acidic coffee similar to a fine Kenyan AA. This is followed by a roasty caramel and just a hint of tobacco. Simply amazing!

After experiencing the aroma,  I take my first sip with great anticipation.a damn it doesnt let me down! The first thing I detect is a smooth milk chocolate. The milk chocolate sweetness exits upon the first bitter bite of those beautiful hops. The hops just sit there mid palate begging to stay a few seconds longer. Then comes the big finish of roasty coffee and subtle smokiness, which completely dominate the palate until the next sip.

Mouthfeel is dead on for this style. A soft level of carbonation plays perfectly into a creamy and slightly sticky mouthfeel.

Overall, I cant say enough good things about this beer. Ive had 2-3 other black IPAs and was left with the thought that maybe its just not my style. Then the Heathen came into my life. The aroma and taste are so complex I could see having a slightly different experience with each bottle. Another world-class offering from Hoppin Frog.

4001,"2012-05-16",4.1,"pours black with reddish hues when held to light. Creamy dissipating one finger head. Aroma of some earthy hops and dark malts, maybe some faint bitter dark chocolate. Medi bodied. Tons of chocolatey flavor slightly offset by some Hoppiness. This is quite impressive. As you get more into the beer, it becomes a lot like hoppy chocolate milk, which I love.","California, USA","Peacehammer"
4001,"2012-05-16",3.7,"Bottle shared by Brett, pour is nicely black and nose is huge and hoppy but after the initial hop bite it subdues to a roasty toasty almost burnt finish which really lingers, after 10 to 15 minutes I could still taste the almost burnt flavor.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","jmikolich"
4001,"2012-05-13",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2012 Shared bomber poured to snifters at Lunar Brewing Co., Thanks, Jack! Displayed a darkest brown color with some ruby highlighting noticeable at the base, a modest layer of tan foam that diminished quickly to a thin ring & film, and left some spotty lacing. The nose was roasty, espresso, cocoa, some citrus & resin, mellow smoke & char, and earthy & herbal notes. The flavor was similar but not as expressive, adding a little tartness, moderate but lingering hop bitterness, soft carbonation, and a medium+ body. Alcohol was present but subdued, and the finale was bitter and dry. Next time, another bomber at Lunar. Thanks Taps! The head was more lasting and laced well, the flavor added a little sweetness & carmelization, and the body seemed fuller. +.2","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
4001,"2012-05-11",4.2,"22 ounce bottle.  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head.  Head retention and lacing are both good.  The brew smells like pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops, roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, and some coffee.  I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but the flavors seem to be stronger overall in comparison to the aroma.  Theres also a nice lingering bitter hoppy and roasty finish.  Good balance between the hops and malt in both the aroma and flavor.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its coating and a bit sticky with moderate carbonation.  Overall, I think its a very good brew.  $9.99 a bottle, Id certainly buy this again in the future.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
4001,"2012-05-10",4.0,"22 oz. pour.  This beer pours black with a thick tan head that nearly coats the glass.  The aroma centers around chocolate and spicy hops, nice roast presence.  I get notes of mint, fresh bakery goods, girl scout thin mint cookies.  Flavor has strong chocolate and mint.  I get medium bitterness, mild sweetness, strong roast.  Some salty notes as well.  Fresh piney and citrus hops are plentiful.  Big, full bodied, nice carbonation.  Finishes bitter and roasty, with plenty of pine.  Nice Black IPA.  One of the best Ive ever had.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
4001,"2012-05-09",3.6,"Bottle @ Dans house, courtesy of a generous trader. Grazie! Dark brown/black appearance with a light brown head. Piney, sprucey, minty, roasty dark chocolate malty aroma. Fairly bitter, dull piney hoppy, slightly herbal, dull chocolate flavor. The aroma is excellent but the flavor leaves something to be desired.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
4001,"2012-05-09",3.6,"Pour out of 22 oz bottle, thanks Aaron for the pour! Dark brownish black pour with nice thin tan head, aroma brings notes of big pine, resin, grapefruit, citrus, lemon and orange notes, hints of grassy and slight floral notes, touch of roast and chocolate.  Taste is slightl caramel, chocolate, hints of slight pine, grass notes, slight spice with some onion and garlic, finishing fairly sweet, slightly bitter.  Interesting, but a bit off.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
4001,"2012-05-04",4.0,"22 oz. bottle via trade with bittermestupid - Pours a deep brown color with a one finger thick light tan head.  Light lacing.  Aroma is resin and pine hops, and lightly roasted malt.  Flavor is lightly roasted malt, chocolate, and pine hops.  Nicely balanced at this point.  Medium body.  A very nice beer.  Thanks Greg.","BFE, Arizona, USA","cbkschubert"
4001,"2012-04-28",4.1,"Bottle from Jeff - thanks!  Black pour with a medium depth tan head that fades down quickly to a slick of foam.  Aroma is sharp resinous pine (maybe some citrus) over a dense, roasted malt backbone that includes some bitter chocolate, a dusting of coffee, and light char.  Taste is a balanced presentation of pine/hop bitterness with a smooth, complex and heavily roasted malt profile that includes tobacco, coffee, bitter chocolate, and a bit of spice.  Mouthfeel is clean and smooth overall with just enough carbonation in the right places to accentuate the bitterness and spice.  Damn - this is impressive!  Ill give it a slight edge over the Wookey Jack simply because the malt profile on this beer is more in line with my personal tastes.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"
4001,"2012-04-27",3.8,"Very black pour with a light head. Very roast aroma that boarders on astringent. Fairly complex flavor with roast, citrus, carbon astringecy, coffee and a solid grain presence. Medium body with a drying mouth feel. Good.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"
4001,"2012-04-24",4.0,"Delicious aroma of roasted chocolate paired with pine notes, there is a hint of alcohol there as well.  Pours an opaque black, with a full light tan head.   This is an amazing beer, slick mouthfeel, low carbonation, and a well balanced battle between roasted notes and hop presence.   This is another solid beer from Hoppin Frog, and Ill be picking up more of this before it disappears off the shelf.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"
4001,"2012-04-22",3.9,"Bomber thanks to Bigmmartin. Pours a pure black color with a small white head (initially a large head). A sweet nose of fruity hops, some roast and caramel. A rich spicy and bitter flavor balanced by chocolate malts and light roast, very smooth and much like the Dubhe from Uinta. Light oranges. Very nice. Lingering bitterness.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
4001,"2012-04-21",4.3,"Bomber. Impatient guy that I am, I opened this when it was still not completely chilled. Well call it cellar temperature. Pour is dark brown and releases a huge tan head on the first pour, but the rest of it chilled further and the second glass was less rambunctious. Aromas are a punch to the nose of resin and grapefruit that later thin out a bit and become more lemony. Flavor was a surprise. I wasnt expecting that heavy of a chocolate presence, but it is in full force and balances nicely against the spruce forest hoppiness. ABV is high enough to give a slight warmth down the throat and finish is nice and resiny. Great stuff again, Fred!","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"
4001,"2012-04-21",4.0,"This is my first experience with Hoppin Frog even though I have lived near Akron for almost two years. Shame on me! This beer poured a thick black and contained some particles in it that showed it was unfiltered. This is not the most beautiful beer you will ever lay your eyes on. The aroma and taste will make up for the appearance! This beer has great balance and is just what it says, Imperial Black Ale. This is not a Black IPA. It is merely a hoppy black ale.","Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, USA","tribefan3521"
4001,"2012-04-20",3.8,"Bottle shared by jmborggren. Poured black color with an average frothy brown head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted malt, chocolate, hop with a small alcohol aroma. Medium body with a dry slick texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy dark bittersweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration. This is a very good complex beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
4001,"2012-04-18",4.0,"Pours blackish brown, decent tan head that persists. Nose is distinct, cocoa puffs, cereal, smoke, roasted malts, coffee and subtle pine hops. Flavors are herbal malt, bitter chocolate bitterness, spice and dry long finish. Some alcohol on the finish. This developed nicely as it warmed. Balanced and quite good","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","ddemmingjr"
4001,"2012-04-18",3.5,"Bottle to oversized snifter. Looks good; black with decent lacing. Smells solid too; bitter and malty. Tastes decent, but Im picking up some soy. Mouthfeel is average. Decent, but not worth spending too much effort to get.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
4001,"2012-04-18",3.5,"Bottle sample at the Elevator tasting at Ale Wine & Spirits on 4/13/12. Clear brown pour with a medium tan head. Roasty nose with lots of spicy and piney hops. Malty flavor with slight caramel before an oniony hop finish.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
4001,"2012-04-18",4.3,"22oz bottle, shared with robotopera. Great light brown head. Good lace. Opaque black color. Nice light and crisp carbonation. Big body, dry texture. Nice herbal big hop aroma. The chocolate malt is definitely there, and its almost as big as the hop. Its actually... A good balance, which makes this a very interesting ale. Awesome bitterness, some spice and sweetness. Very tasty. One of the best beers Ive had in a while.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
4001,"2012-04-17",4.0,"A great idea that made it from concept to kettle to bottle to glass.
A dual identity beer that does not suffer from split personality.
The Frog has captured my desire to have a dark beer with the right color, carbonation and flavors that meld not fight to satisfy my palate.
Drank craft beer fromNew hampshire to New Mexico that do not rival this distinct taste that works my palate without offending my senses.  I can drink more than one of these at a session.  I have a cultivated taste without being a beer nazi.  Well done Hoppin Frog!","","livewyre"
4001,"2012-04-17",4.1,"This brew pours dark brownish-black with a medium tan head that dissipates steadily. Rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of hops, pine and roasted malt.

4001,"2012-04-13",4.0,"Pours jet black with tan head and moderate lacing.  Aroma is dominated by powerful pine hops and a touch of citrus hops.  Taste starts like a porter and ends like a spicy Black IPA.  Wow.  This one packs a punch.","Ohio, USA","Daytonbeer"
