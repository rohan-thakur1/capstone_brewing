Im Antrunk ist es frisch, etwas wässrig und angenehm herb. Der Hauptteil ist leicht säuerlich und immer noch etwas flach. Erst im Nachgeschmack wird das Bier vollmundig-süffig und schön malzig-röstmalzig. Es tauchen neben der ale-typischen herbe Säuerlichkeit auch angenehme espresso-röstmalztöne auf.

1279,"2006-05-28",2.5,"(500 ml bottle: Obtained 01-Mar-06 in trade with bogdi1, thanks Juha!) This is a gorgeous-looking beer, but sadly, thats the high point.  Medium-brown in color with nearly perfect clarity, the miniscule bubbles can be seen rising slowly toward the surface.  The billowy tan head is lively and long-lasting, settling to and maintaining a quarter-inch foamy layer for the entire session.  Unfortunately, Im getting a bit of apple skins in the otherwise lightly roasty nose, and thats one of the flaws I find most intolerable.  But while the crisp, red apple skins are present in the flavor as well, most notably in the finish, theres a significant enough roasty component that the apples are less prominent and intrusive.  The mildly sweet beer is only lightly bitter, but also quite dry and dusty in flavor and on the palate.  Carbonation is moderate.  I think the apple skins are masking some of the flavor components, so overall, this beer is drinkable, but thats as far as Ill go","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Strongly aromatic-hoppy and sweetish flavor with roasted maltiness and some toffee-oaky character. Smooth, quite warming, oily and slicky palate with low carbonation.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"
1279,"2004-10-07",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 8, 2004 Bottle. The colour is not very pale, but deep copper red. The medium-sized foam with medium-sized bubbles builds a little crater. The liquid is clear. 

The generous smell is loaded with lots of somewhat burned malt and a somewhat sourish flavour of hops. Challenger? Probably.

The carbonation is mild and pleasant. I like!

There is an almost sour taste in the start, but a potent sweet malty aroma soon replaces it. The growing and very balanced bitterness fades quickly, making this beer surprisingly easy to drink.

This is most defiantly a Strong Pale Ale in taste, but it is also a very typical brew from Jämtlands Bryggeri with their trademark blend of hops (Challenger and Bramling Cross). Indeed a great pale ale!","Linköping, SWEDEN","bark"

I dont get the malt balance that the others here report; this seems to be less English-style than other bitters, less mild, but I defer to others with vastly more experience than me.
