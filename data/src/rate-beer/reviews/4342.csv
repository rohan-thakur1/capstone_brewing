4342,"2014-03-03",3.7,"Ins Glas ergießt sich ein dunkelgoldenes Bier mit geringer Schaumkrone. Geruch sehr malzig, Karamell, grasig, hopfig. Geschmack trocken hopfig, süß, würzig, alkoholisch.","P´Castle, GERMANY","Beerhunter111"
4342,"2014-01-20",4.7,"Dieses Bier ist farblich eine perfekte Referenz für ""goldgelb"". Kräftig und nur minimalst getrübt macht dieses Ale dem Auge richtig Freude. Nicht zu intensive Schaumbildung, aber kurz bedeckt eine reinweiße feinporige Schaumschicht fingerdick das Bier. Aromatisch will meiner Nase zunächst nicht so ganz trauen - ist das wirklich Ananas? Jawohl ist es! Und zwar extrem kräftig. Ebenfalls vorhandene Zitrusnoten übernehmen nur begleitende Funktionen. Und dann eine deutliche Spur von Koriander. Auch wenn dieses Bier sicher zu den stärkeren zählt - im Antrunk merkt man nicht viel davon. Sehr fruchtig süß gehalten ist der Alkohol gut versteckt. Malzige Noten wechseln sich mit würzigen Koriandernoten ab. Die Kohlensäure ist extrem fein und aktiv ausgefallen und spielt lebhaft an der Zunge. Die süßen Töne werden im Verlauf immer schwächer und machen nun dem Alkohol und ersten kräuterartigen Hopfennoten Platz. So langsam beginnt man den Alkoholgehalt zu realisieren. Im Finish kommt der Hopfen zu seinem großen Auftritt. ""Bühne frei"", denn mit einer begleitenden Kräuternote kommen nun die Bitterhopfeneinflüsse und machen den süßen Aromen den Gar aus. So ganz schaffen sie es nicht, aber die Hopfenbittere klingt herrlich an Zunge und Gaumen aus. Viel mehr Komplexität ist fast nicht mehr möglich.","Vienna, AUSTRIA","Monsta112"

Aroma of yeast, must, honey, spices, bread, some citrus. Tastes of spices, grass, bread, honey, bubblegum, earth, some yellow fruits, very complex, great balance between a light bitterness, sweetness and earthyness! Full body with a creamy texture, lively carbonation and a smooth spicy and bready finish. The high ABV isnt really noticeable, very smooth to drink. Great! Easily the flagship beer of the Bierzauberei, very complex and greatly balanced, it offers a uniqueness you wont often find in Austrian beers!","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"

4342,"2013-04-03",4.2,"Bottle, pours golden with a reddish hue. Musty heavy aroma, not the best. Crisp with a snap at first.
