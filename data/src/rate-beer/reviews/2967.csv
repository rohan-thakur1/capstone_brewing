2967,"2015-02-26",2.9,"[Tap] Pours a straw color with a fizzy and quickly receding head on top. Aromas of sweet light malts and mild corny notes. Flavors of corn flakes, straw, wet grass, sweet grains and some alcohol. Very little bitterness and the finish is abrupt. Pretty clean though. Tasting notes from 9/2014.","Illinois, USA","troyc"
2967,"2015-01-23",3.2,"bottle. Golden with one finger head. A bit of sweet corn with some grain and light fruitiness. Pretty smooth, with not much booziness. I guess this is about as good as malt liquors get.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"
2967,"2014-11-30",3.1,"PHD pours a mostly cloudy sunset orange with a thick beige head that doesnt last too long. The aroma is caramel, raisin and bread. The flavor is caramel, raisin bread and wheat. Overall this beer is alright. Nothing stands out as spectacular, but nothing stands out as terrible either.","Michigan, USA","TheBear11D"
2967,"2014-10-22",3.5,"From notes. Finally getting around to adding beers from the Ypsi Summer Beerfest! Enjoyed on July 25. A Malt Liquor. Here we go! The pour is a nice deep amberish gold with a nice off white head. The aroma is a bit fruity and somewhat hoppy with a little bit of a dirty funk to it. Not much else going on, but I wasnt expecting much. The taste is mildly citrusy with a little hop zing to it, wrapped all together with a decent booziness. The back end carries a moderate metallic tendency that youd expect with a malt liquor. The mouth feel is a little thin, but then gets a little sticky with the carbonation. The aftertaste is a bit metallic and lingering. Minimal expectations going in, so it definitely didnt disappoint!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
2967,"2014-07-28",3.0,"Notes. Pours deep gold with nice white. Sweet cereal aroma. Taste is very sweet sticky malt, taste like a bowl of corn flakes.","bloomfield, Michigan, USA","mikem409"
2967,"2014-07-26",3.7,"On tap...a style that everyone loves to hate, but this is a tasty if rather sweetish brew that is a better use of Frosted Flakes than in a bowl with milk. A great change of pace from ODing on IPAs all the time.","Peoples Republic of Bloomington, Indiana, USA","paintedmaple"
2967,"2014-06-04",3.5,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2015 Tap: Muddled orange body with a foamy & frothy off-eggshell colored head. Surprising strength in the aroma of grains, mild citrus, & some pungent, dirty, earthy hop notes. Rather simple but still more commanding & ""present"" than expected for a malt liquor. Tastes of sweetbread with a hint of bubblegum (yeast?) sweetness; mild citrus & plenty of zesty hop notes that carry an earthy vibe. Mild alcohol strength creeps in, leading towards a lightly toasted bread finish with faint metallic notes, dying citrus & moderate yeast in the aftertaste. Slightly sticky mouth coating. Honestly, expectations were rock bottom but this was pretty good, really.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
2967,"2014-05-20",3.7,"On draft hopcat in east Lansing. Pours medium head medium gold, nearly clear.Big malt sweetness In aroma. Flavor is malty, with fruit and alcohol. Interesting beer for a malt liquor. I like it.","Michigan, USA","KPD"
2967,"2013-07-27",3.4,"On tap at MBGSF 2013. Hazy gold pour with a white head. Fruity pale malt aroma. Flavor of fruity caramel malts. Very evocative of the style, but very tasty at the same time. A good malt liquor! Very impressed.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"
2967,"2013-07-27",3.1,"On tap at Greenbush, because what the hell. Our server said they literally make this with Frosted Flakes. Pours a slightly hazy golden with a thin eggshells head. Nose involves some citrus notes along with cake frosting and cereal grain. Really sweet flavor with some bitterness back there. Medium bodied, very actively carbed, with a fruity and slightly spicy finish. Hilarious, and certainly nothing Id want more than 6 oz. of, but a good quirky effort. Listed at 8.1% ABV on the board.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"
2967,"2013-07-21",2.4,"6 oz pour on tap at the brewpub (Saywer, MI). Stopped in for lunch on the way to Holland. Pours a nice gentle hazed pour, golden deeper body and gentle glow on the edges and bottom. A frothy white head dies to a filmy layer, laces ok. Aromas show bready malt, a bit of flaked maize, straw, and gentle grainy cereal elements. Touch of earth, gentle dryness mixes with that cereal sweet element. Simple. A touch sweet as it should be. Initial is medium bodied, preaching a brief smooth coolness up front. Quickly becomes tart, green apple and bready feel. Straw, grainy, some corn and wheat bread. A bit doughy, the middle holds a firmness, as that tart tangy character returns. Almost white grape, vegetal feel. Some bread, tart tangy holds on for the duration. A bit of floral, white grape, more apple and almost a cidery feel. Faint warmth. Meh. I guess its exactly as it should be. It looked good, smelled ok, taste went south quickly for me. Not something Id revisit but certainly an interesting take on a weird style.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2967,"2013-07-06",3.1,"Lets start by re-establishing this is malt liquor. 20 oz mug at brewery. Aroma is mild and farmy. Appearance is light golden, almost yellow with a quickly disappearing head. Taste is all sweet with almost no hop linger and the slight presence of swert grain, due to the copious amounts of frosted flakes used in brewing. Pallete is thin with a malty and sweet finish, medium carbonated and minimal aftertaste. This is the best malt liquor ive had that wasnt out of a fourty! Highly recommended for doubters of this style.","Michigan, USA","hopheadtenor"
2967,"2012-09-12",3.0,"Draft. Pours a hazy gold with nice white head. The aroma is strong of alcohol and malt, refreshing. The taste is big upfront. Strong malt flavor, but this isn't your Colt 45 malt beverage. Good effort here.

2967,"2012-08-12",3.3,"Sampled from the tap at the 15th annual MBGSF. Pours a clear pale golden amber and a white that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a good amount of sweet grains and corn with a slight hint of underlying grass notes. Flavor is sweet with corn up front some grain coming in and just a hint of grassiness.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
2967,"2012-07-26",3.4,"Draft. Poured clear golden color with an average frothy white head that was mostly lasting with excellent lacing. Moderate sweet malt and cereal aroma. Medium body with a sticky texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration with a small alcohol bite. Good beer for style.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
