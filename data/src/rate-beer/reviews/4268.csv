4268,"2014-08-21",4.0,"Bottle: Poured a clear blonde color ale with a nice huge pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of nice clean cereal notes with light subtle flora notes. Taste is also dominated by very nice crisp and clean cereal notes with light dry hoppy notes and limited residual sugar notes or butter notes that can be easily found in the style. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. This beer is clean and easily drinkable and a great example of the style.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

Dun blond foncé, un col de mousse qui ne dure pas et ne laisse pas de traces, ou du moins, très peu. La portion mousseuse reprend vie cependant, en la secouant. Une drôle dimpression de soufre qui fraye au travers des effluves citronnées, maltées et de vernis à ongles. Un goût bien charpenté par une texture douce et légèrement sirupeuse, qui enrobe le malt, comme sil samenait avec de grosses mitaines et sort de son sac, maladroitement, des saveurs amères. Tout ça semble se fatiguer rapidement et tire sa révérence tout en somnolant. Jai bien aimé quand même. (648-210412/220513)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","AlainG"

Terrific aroma, honey sweetness, ripe tree fruit, light spiciness with some lemon - lemon saison.  Taste is not anywhere as sweet - in fact its sour and a bit metallic; theres some pungent dry floral bitterness, not much alcohol - something seems a bit not right with this to me.

Flavour is similar, light tart sourness, lemon, pale malt base. Average palate is fairly effervescent. Slightly infected I suspect, or possibly tart on purpose - its hard to tell with some of these Hopfenstark bottles! If intentional, the pale malt base is the only real Helles like characteristic to it.

4268,"2010-06-05",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2011 My Bottom Line:
This beautifully malty Helles benefits from a cushy body to lay down its  herbal, spicy hop flavors which slowly rise above chewy cereals in an elegantly bitter finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the misty golden.
-This is more reminiscent of a BohPils in body and hop intensity than traditional German Helles. Actually, it reminds me of 7 Sterns Helles, which is modeled after Bohemian Pilseners.
-The noble hop signature also produces citrusy tips.
-I love it when a brew produces great malt flavors without too many residual sugars in the way.
-There is plenty of complexity developed within the simple ingredient list.
-Some batches have been fruitier than others, pointing at fermentation by-products. None of these notes are unpleasant, but they stray away from typical lager profiles.
