4496,"2015-05-20",3.6,"Draft at Pottstown. Hazy brown pour with minimal head. Nose is caramel malt, nuts, hops. Tastes rich, like an old ale with more molasses and caramel flavor.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
4496,"2014-05-07",3.5,"At the 2014 Goat Races. Odd beer for the style. Nutty, toasted malt, fruity. Deep amber/brown, off white head. The finish is sweet, spicy, piney. Medium to medium/thick in body. Decent, but a tad odd.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
4496,"2013-05-06",3.4,"Tap at the goat races, inside the pub.  Deep brown, opaque and hazy from yeast, red highlights and mild tan head lacing, nose is sweet and full of cherry and red fruit, light medium body in the mouth with strong alcohol but no burn; eventually warms the chest a bit.  Dark malt and faint grapiness toward the end, no lasting bitterness, mild sweetness.  Brown sugar and toffee.  Nice.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

4496,"2007-06-29",3.4,"Appears a dark, copper toned amber with a small, off-white head that slowly fades into a mild cap and collar.  Spotty lacing is left around the glass.
Smell is of freshly boiled malt, brown sugar, maple sugar, caramel, and mild amounts of grapes.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a light grassiness, and spiciness, along with malt, black grapes, and molasses.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, syrupy, malty, with a dry spiciness in the finish.  The abv is evident in this one.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"
4496,"2007-06-03",3.4,"On tap at the Goat Races. Pours a translucent deep brown with a small off white head.  Aroma of dark fruits, sweet malty grains, caramel and light nuts.  Favor of caramel, grains, sweet malts, molassess and nuts.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
4496,"2007-05-24",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2014 Poured a reddish brown color with a small, off white head that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of raisins, nuts, caramel malts, clove, husky grains, and toasted dough.  Taste of caramel malts, spicy clove, nuts toasty dough, light citrus fruits, toffee, some anise, and a dry, cereal finish. A fair amount of alcohol as well.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
4496,"2007-05-09",3.4,"Draft at Goat race. Clear dark brown color with small head. The aroma was like Slacker bock. Caramel and roasted flavors throughtout. Some burnt malt in the finish. Fizzy on the palate. Same as Slacker but only thicker.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","Ty5592"
4496,"2007-05-07",3.5,"8 oz glass, 2007 Goat Races.  Pours a clear dark brown body without any head at all, or at least till it reached my table that is, and no visible carbonation.  Aroma is all malt, mostly thick caramel and a little toffee with fairly noticable alcohol fumes.  Flavor is much the same, lots of malt but without a whole lot of sweetness, heavy caramel and an almost nutty huskiness.  The alcohol makes itself known on the finish and is a little bit too irritating on the back of the throat.  Mouthfeel was thick and full bodied, but pretty well attenuated cause there really wasnÂ’t any cloying stickiness.  Light carbonation level.  Overall, the better of the two Eisbocks of the day, but no where near as good as the Instigator version of 2006.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
