2946,"2015-12-17",3.7,"Sample (4 oz) from bottle (750 ml) at home. Thanks to SlovakSniper for this one! Clear bright golden a small instantly vanishing white head. Aroma is a bit farmy with leathery notes, tart apples and green apples notes. Taste is also quite farmy with nice tart apples presence leathery - not bretty though - notes and earthy/mineal notes. Light body. Still. A bit tannic. Bone dry finish. Very interesting product. Nice farmy and leathery character. Easy drinking and quenching.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2946,"2015-12-13",3.7,"Un liquide presque orangé avec un faux col. Le nez de peau de pomme exhibe aussi des parfums de cuir, de paille, de campagne, de basse-cour. Le goût de pommes et de levures sauvages chemine vers une finale terreuse et très sèche. Délicates bulles qui métonnent dans un corps moyen-faible qui montre une texture vineuse. Jaime bien.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
2946,"2015-10-01",4.9,"Rustic, dry, funky, earthy. Reminded me a bit of a Spanish Sidra without too much acidity. Love the wild fermentation aspect of it.","","Craftbrewhaha"
2946,"2015-03-21",3.5,"Bottle at CiderWISE, pours a clear pale golden blonde with a small white head. Nose is subtle, with some wild yeast and dry apples. Flavour is bone dry, with quite a high farmhouse funk factor, mouth-drying apples, and medium acidity. The funk is very pleasing, complementing the dryness expertly. Couldnt drink much of this, due to the huge dryness, but its very well-done.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2946,"2014-12-11",3.6,"Elegant swing-top 750 ml bottle.
Light gold pour with a very short-lived white head. Rich musty aroma, recalling the browned apples laying on the ground of a late fall apple orchard. A decided sharpness of green apple as well. Some brown sugar in the aroma -- but not in the extremely dry flavor. Tart almost to the point of mouth-puckering, again green apple, leather, lemon rind. House character, plenty wild/rustic. Tasty but perhaps a stretch at the price point.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2946,"2014-08-27",3.6,"Bottle @ Sea Cider. Clear golden pour with small bubbles. Fruity apple flesh and skins. Yeast, some spice, flowers, pear, and sugar. Slight vanilla and dough. Nice yeast, too. Flavor is tart and has a subtle smoke. Floral and slightly herbal. Good acidity. White grape, green apple skin, and yeast. Subtle lemon peel and juice on the finish.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

2946,"2014-07-03",3.1,"Refrigerated 75 cl clear bottle capped with flip top. Aroma is very light apple, medium body, no carbonation, and no lacing. Taste is light apple and dry finish. Expected more based on ratings, but a big fan of dry ciders.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
2946,"2014-07-02",3.0,"Bottle at the cidery, 7.2% ABVDeep blond color. Nice aroma of apples with light vinegary note. Dry mouthfeel, weak body; too acidic, with some vinegar and acetone. A bit astringent in the end, lemony.Not very elegant.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

2946,"2013-10-04",3.8,"Bottle courtesy of ajax25g to celebrate government shutdown day 4, and also his finding a new job in DC, an odd combo. Bottle. Bright clear gold color, champagne head.

2946,"2013-06-01",3.9,"750 swingtop, capped. Pours a clear bright medium gold with no head or lace. Bright tart apple skin nose. Creamy medium body with minimal carb. Tart, almost puckery mid palate. Very much on the tarter side, closer to a granny smith, easily, as table apples go. Closer to a true cider apple base, much less sweetness, no apparent white sugar. Crisp tart finish that lingers a bit.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2946,"2012-12-29",3.9,"Resealable 750 from letspour dot com. May 11, 2012 sticker on the bottom. Tall Rare Vos tumbler.

Muddled, mellow gold body. Quick spritz. Solid activity.

Yeasty, green, acidy, fermenting floral/grass/mulch-like funk.

Tin-y, twangy, & a touch sour. Sour apple chips & a little spicy zest. Prickly carbonation. Dry mouth. Hidden alcohol. Tart, yeasty, vanilla finish.

Good, but not $20 good.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"
2946,"2012-12-19",4.3,"Picked up at Whole Foods Bellevue. There is a light layer of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. It looks like the cider could develop over time. Beautiful light haze on an agitated pour. Taste is upfront with cider apples but there is an undercurrent of funk from the brett that is both drying and complex. Very light bodied but the carbonation helps the cider stay lively and dance on the tongue. Nice wild finish. A very well made and interesting cider.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Lazerlobe"
2946,"2012-12-18",4.4,"750ml bottle purchased at Bottleworks. 
Aroma of brett, funk, horse saddle, barn, field, orchard, and apple skins. Super complex nose. 
Looks like a cloudy witt beer but with champagne like carbonation.
Taste is beautiful dry funk. reminds me of drie fontienen oude gueuze fresh. Lots of brettanomyces flavors with a nice acidity to it as well. Really is like an apple lambic or basque cider. 
Palate is drying and densely carbonated. 
Overall a fantastic bone-dry cider. Im going to try aging one to see if it develops like a lambic.","Seattle, Washington, USA","mages64"
2946,"2012-12-18",3.6,"Bottle. Pours with a crystal clear full golden hue with massive carbonation that settles down to a white ring. Aromas are of medium strong bretty funk, dry tannins, acidic, lightly tart apples, straw, damp flowers and a bit of mineral earthiness. Flavors show good acid balance, medium strong tannin, bone dry with a large carbonic hit. Medium floral character and zesty bright fruit. Pleasant funk that is quite a bit more subdued than it was on the nose. Very lively, bone dry, medium-light body with well hidden alcohol. Easy and pleasant to drink with satisfying complexity.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

2946,"2012-07-27",4.0,"8 ounce sample at Beveridge Place Pub.  Musty, funky, barnyardy Brett aroma.  Light cheese.  Nice underlying apple character.  Great aroma.  Transparent golden body with some small, white bubbly lacing present.  Effervescent bubbles greet the palate immediately.  Becomes dry, Bretty-funky and barnyardy in the middle.  Pimento olive flavors come through later on with some nice apple character.  Fantastic cider.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
2946,"2012-07-17",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2014 
Draught (7,2%) @ Brouwers Cafe, Seattle
Aroma has lots of somewhat tart apples with leathery and earthy notes. Flaovur is really dry and somewhat tart with apples and leathery notes. Good, although I expected more aggressive stuff based on the word lambic.","Tampere, FINLAND","laiti"
2946,"2011-09-22",3.3,"UPDATED: MAR 14, 2017 pours cloudy yellow. It is dry, fresh apple aromas, very crisp when chilled. Firm with a medium bite.

(re-tasted March 14, 2017)

Visual: Bailer top re-sealable bottle. Pours medium-deep golden apple juice yellow with no significant head, very thin ringed retention, a bit of activity but not a lot.

Nose: musky apple juice, some woodiness, trace amount of funk. (lvl-5)-pungency

Attack: crisp, acidic-dry impression

Mid-palate: (lvl-1)-sweetness, juicy woody red apple juice, medium tart, trace funk, tangy crisp acidity

Finish: woody apple exhale, residual tart puckeriness,

Summary: The woody depth and slight funk adds some interest to this - a decent meal cider and an palate-whetter.","","sulawang"
2946,"2009-01-17",3.5,"Bottle from CapFlu.  Nice gold with thin bubbles on the edge of the glass.  Aroma is sweet apples, mixed with a tartness, some caramel and honey light alcohol and oak.

2946,"2008-09-27",3.5,"Bottle, courtesy of microakes. Bottle popped with celebratory loudness. Warm golden. Slight haze. Little to no head. Fun, funky, pleasant, and inviting aroma. Wild yeasts and wile apple tartness mingle neatly in a rustic pocket. Too much fizz, unfortunately overcarbonated. Alcohol is detectable and is not entirely smooth because of it but its a really nice cider. Lots of apple core flavors. Dry, rustic, resinous, and almost like a retsina in its peculiar funk.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
2946,"2008-07-04",3.5,"Picked up a single 500 ml swing top bottle at Brewery Creek in Vancouver, BC. Pours a semi-hazy golden cider with some carbonation bubbles and a clean top.

Finish is quite dry and tart with a crisp apple skin aftertaste that quickly disappears.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
