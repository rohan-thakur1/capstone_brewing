Deep chocolate, caramel, raisins, wood, roasted toast flavours, paired with burned malts, very refreshing, dry and hoppy finish, never missing a nice, strong malt backbone. Finish adds complexity to it, because of the still lingering malt. Finish is very long, a bitter taste is still there.

Fruity as well and that makes it quite complex for this strength and style. Quite bitter and slightly sharp. Lacks a bit in body. This beer benefits with big gulps. Maybe thats the reason it comes in one litre bottles... Its quite moreish. Tastes fresh - which it is! I have to go to Düsseldorf some day to ""trink vom fass"".
