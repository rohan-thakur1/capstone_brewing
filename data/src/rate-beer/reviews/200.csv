200,"2017-06-10",4.1,"Thanks carl! This kolsch was amazing. Super fresh and hoppy. Crisp with nice grassy backbone, lively citrus hops, mild yeast presence. Perfect easy drinking beer. Tasty!","Georgia, USA","rdixon77"
200,"2017-06-05",4.0,"16-05-17 // 500ml can at home, shared, bought at Trillium Boston by a friend. Very hazy light yellowish beer, almost no head. Nothing in common with a german Kölsch but I dont care its a great refreshing beer. Light bodied, some straw and hay, pale malts, mild grains. Mild grape, some fruits, even wineous notes. Minimal bitter finish. Great.","Mainz, GERMANY","Maracuja05"
200,"2017-05-26",3.7,"Une bière blonde, voilée a la manière classique de Trillium, avec presque aucune carbonatation. Au nez, on sent bien les agrumes, avec également des mangues, mais aussi un petit côté céréalier nous rappelant les pilsners. Au goût, on remarque dabord une certaine amertume, ainsi que du houblon agrumé, rendant cette bière difficile à distinguer dune IPA standard. La finale par contre est un peu plus sèche et plus sur le grain, ce aui change des bières plus juteuses de Trillium. Bien que cette bière est fort appréciable - on doit se rendre à lévidence que cette bière représente peut-être un peu mal le style.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"
200,"2017-05-19",3.6,"Tall of can thanks to Tracy G. Poured total NE style, looks like a glass of lightly carbonated oj with a smaller bright white foamy head. Aroma starts off with a big burst of eraser rubbings and light woody that gives way to cracker, grains, floral hops and light fruit notes. Flavor mimics the aroma. Medium milky body with barely there cabination. Crushable on this 90°+ day.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
200,"2017-04-30",4.0,"Poured from can dated 4/7/17 hazy lemon with a nice white head. Aromas of nice herbal floral notes citrus grains and mild pine. Taste is delicious nice soft mouthfeel like most Trillium beers. Balanced notes of citrus hop and grains. Another stellar beer.","Middleton, Massachusetts, USA","Chalumeaux"
200,"2017-04-30",4.0,"16 oz. can split by T.J, got to get them Trillium ticks!! Canned 7 April, 2017. Pours a bright, hazy golden body with thin white lacing. Nose is dry fruit nice Nelson, mild straw and minerals. Soft notes of fresh grass and minerality on the palate. The Nelson Sauvin is alive and well in this batch. Just wonderful white grape, hay, and juicy fruit. Is this a traditional German Kolsch? Hell no it isnt. But I dont really care. Super drinkable, super crushable.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
200,"2017-04-28",4.2,"Drinks like a kolsch leaning session IPA, and a great one at that. Perfect use of Nelson hops, delicate bit aromatic and stanky and oh so flavorful. Light refreshing and delicious.

200,"2017-04-27",4.1,"Can (473 ml) at home, split 2-ways. Canned April 7th 2017 so about 3 weeks old. Thanks to Pier-Olivier for this can! Milky pale yellow with a medium white head, good retention, leaving some lacing. Aroma is soft and crackery cereals forward yet theres a beautiful addition of Nelson Sauvin hops which blends beautifully with the herbal profile and the mild cereals spiciness. Taste is crackery cereals and herbal forward - and does have some similarities with authentic Kölsch, with some white grapes/white wine notes, light citrusy notes, mild cereals spiciness and mild herbal bitterness. Light-medium body. Moderate carbonation. Herbal and rathery dry finish with some white grapes at the end of the sip. A clean, crisp, highly drinkable and quenching kölsch inspired beer with a lovely Nelson Sauvin hop addition the fits the profile nicely. Thats really well executed.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
200,"2017-04-24",3.5,"Draught. Pours hazy straw yellow with a moderate white head. Aroma is mango, grass, and a little papaya. Taste is grass, onion, citrus, minerals, and some light spice. Dry finish. Relatively bitter. Medium body. Lively - but not quite prickly - carbonation. Mouthfeel has an earthy farmhouse roughness to it. The hops push this ""kolsch"" into pale ale territory. Its arguably not a very good execution of a kolsch as it doesnt even resemble the style, but it is a highly enjoyable nelson IPA.","Massachusetts, USA","tapefuzz"
200,"2017-04-21",3.8,"4/21/17. Can thanks to Carl! LOL - Kolsch inspired indeed. Awesome beer - nothing like a kolsch. Hazy golden pour, nice white head. Awesome fresh hoppy aroma. Good flavor, pale malts, hoppy, fresh, delicious!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
200,"2016-04-26",3.8,"750ml. Bottle shared by Chris. Slight opaque yellow-gold. Firm white head. A ton of hops for a kolsch. Dense tropical hop, a little hop funk. Dry-tart sip, clean and a little kolsch sour-grain snappiness. But juicy tropical hops throughout. Hoppy, interesting but hard to consider this as a kolsch. But nonetheless I totally dig it.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
200,"2016-02-20",3.6,"750 ml bottle poured at Chriss place. Pours a bright golden color with a full cover fizz head. Hop present, spice and funk aroma. This is not a kolsch. Should be changed soon. High carb, citrus, grassy, dry finish. Fun hybrid style. Tasty.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
200,"2016-02-20",3.6,"Bottle thanks to Reynolds314. Clear pale pour, frothy white head, good retention and lacing. Aroma is definitely happier than what I think of in a kolsch - those around me say tropical, but my damned blind spot again -- I get more of the grassy/weedy stuff on the nose. Moderately sweet; prickly carb; light-medium body. Overall: sort of a fun hoppy session beer -- hard to peg it as a kolsch, but tasty, light and nice. Wish I could enjoy the tropics.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

Cracker and grass alongside heavy lime profile.. bordering on session IPA, husky grain nose. Front palate is soft cracker sweetness, pops with bright citrus and oils, the dryness mid-finish recalls De La Senne without the hop brightness or that yeast. Somewhat filmy, soft through the end.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
200,"2015-12-27",4.1,"750ml bottle pours a hazy gold with some spitty white head. Nose is big with grass and chives, tropical fruit, heavy with green leaves. Flavor is mellow, light malt, lime, lemon, chives, grass. Dry finish. Super drinkable. Very well made, but lets get real, this isnt 1% kolsch. This is a very nice IPA, but not one bit kolsch.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
200,"2015-12-23",4.1,"First beer I had at the main December DC RB Tasting. Poured a very vibrant yellow-orange color with a fluffy white head atop. Aroma was lots of citrus notes, oranges, yeast. Flavor was very nice crisp malt with a lot of juicy hop notes. Not really at all like a Kolsch, but whatever - it was a fantastic beer. Should just call this a Session IPA. Its certainly one of the best ones.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"

200,"2015-04-10",3.8,"32oz growler from the brewery consumed later that day, Summer 2014Very lovely pour reveals a pale golden liquid, shimmering with fine bubbles and a medium-sized white head that recedes to cover. Clarity is high, with just a touch of chill-haze.Fantastic tropical fruit and dry, leafy, rich herbs emanate forth from the hops. Very inviting, with some straw-like maltiness and dried haystacks. More rustic from the nose (and hoppy) than any German kolsch Ive had, but its delightful, whatever it is. No alcohol or flaws.Wonderfully attenuated, with a dry, crackery-like malt body providing just a dollop of honeyed biscuit-like sweetness. Carbonation is tight and engaging and the hops explode with ample bitterness and tons of dry, yellow tropical fruitiness and herbs. Sadly, theres a strong bland note that severely dampens the brightness. I assume something to do with the hops. Moderately astringent, though thankfully not dirty (a la some of the dirty dishwater notes occasionally found in Night Shifts IPAs). Strange too, as the beer is in great condition and its not one of the murky still-has-the-hop-particulates-in-suspsension beers that one would expect this sort of thing from. Other than that, though, fantastic, wonderfully drinkable beer (and still quite good despite that).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
200,"2014-06-22",4.2,"Growler, from the brewery. Aroma is a complete and utter Nelson bomb. Grapefruit, flint, gunpowder, ground papaya seeds and scheurebe. Pungent, overflowing, and intoxicating. This tasks not much like Kolsch nor Rye malt, but plenty, oh plenty, of Nelson hops, in a good way. I think the malt backbone in the base is supportive and its a bit of a bummer that the kolsch charactersitics got overpowered, but its a wonderful canvas for the beautiful Nelson show. Grapefruit, bay leaves, and tarragon come through with white gooseberries. Fresh, juicy, beautifully hopped and thirst quenching. Fantastic.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
200,"2014-06-11",3.8,"32oz growler in a teku. Pours golden with a lacy, white head. Aroma of floral and fruity hops, pale malts and bread, light rye notes, and faint earthy notes.

200,"2014-05-10",4.2,"Pours out a hazy yellow/orange with a white head on top. This beer boasts an essentially perfect aroma, tons of fresh fruity and citrus hops. Flavor is fairly similar, but a little less intense. I definitely get the ""sauvin"" part of the hop name, some serious grape going on here. A tiny bit of spiciness, perhaps from the rye. Soft and light mouthfeel, but with a fairly dry finish that imparts only a tiny hint of bitterness. Good to see some hoppy beers on the lighter end of the spectrum coming out of Trillium.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ScipioA"
