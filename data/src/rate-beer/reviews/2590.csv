2590,"2016-04-20",3.7,"Shared 750 ml. bottle poured to snifters showing a hazed, orangey gold color, with light particulates swimming freely, a modest layer of white head foam, and spots of lacing. The aroma was light yeast & wheat, a ripened scent of pit fruit, skins & peels, spices, earthiness, and sweetness. Medium bodied, and fairly carbonated, with a successful melding of the aroma notes, the taste produced a less complicated, but ultimately pleasant & tasty brew, with light tartness, and subtle dryness to the finish. Alcohol was noticeable, but somewhat an afterthought.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
2590,"2016-04-10",3.7,"Pours a medium orangish amber color. Aromas of fruit, honey like qualities, citrus, and a hint of alcohol. Flavors of sweet fruit, honey, and some malt. Dry grape like finish.","Fort Walton Beach, Florida, USA","oldrtybastrd"

2590,"2015-06-25",3.4,"From a bomber poured into a tulip. Aroma is plain wheat. Flavor is typical unfiltered wheat beer. Lots of grain. A little spice but nothing that strong. Pretty unexceptional. Not getting any of the ""dry"" or ""fruity"" flavors they claim. Its fine, but I dont really understand why this is in an $11 bomber. There are better wheats sold in cans.","Illinois, USA","drdisque"

The palate is sweet and winey as well, with candyish pale malts and tripel-like esters. Not bad, but pretty pricey for what it is.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

2590,"2015-02-20",3.6,"Bomber from the brewery. The fruit is distinct in the nose, grape and pear are obvious. Highly carbonated, nice fluffy head. So the beer is sweet, nice flavor but a bit overwhelming four my palate. I like it and would recommend it to others, but not sure I would drink again.","","raoul_duke"

2590,"2014-10-10",3.7,"Draft at Six Ten Brewing ( Tampa, FL ). Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a foamy white head. Very nice lacing along the glass. Aroma is heavy on the grape must up front with trailing wheat notes. A lot going on in the flavor including the grape and pear along with a nice combination of spices. Very interesting beer. Looking forward to trying more from this brewery in the future.","Land O Lakes, Florida, USA","jjuf1853"
2590,"2014-06-24",3.9,"750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. Thanks match1112. Pours a clear golden amber body with an ever lasting head of soapy white foam. Nose is a little black pepper, soap, and biscuits followed by loads of pears and white grape juice. Taste is light spice followed by grape and pear juice. A little bubble gum/banana ester on the finish. Starts off so juicy but finishes dry and clean. Kinda basic but this is super tasty and refreshing. Awesome witbier.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"
2590,"2014-05-06",3.5,"Draft at Hopleaf, April 18. Sweet smelling ale. Once you get a sip of it (hard for me since Im standing while juggling this beer, my phone for recording notes, and a cone of frites), the grape must comes out in the nose. Very similar to Dogfish Heads 61. Orange color with a very thin head. Just a nice-drinking beer. This grape must thing seems to be an encouraging trend in fruit beers. A great idea that I hope more brewers add to their lineups.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

2590,"2014-03-02",3.0,"Cask pour at Night of the Living Ales 2014 (Chicago, IL). Pours a murky hazy dulled golden straw hue with bubbly whitish head atop. Sticks around, laces a bit. Aromas are a touch sweet, bready malts, white grape, touch of peach and pear. Gentle nuttiness, some more white grape, bread. Initial is a bit floral, white grape, some melon, gentle bready malt and florals. Some gentle dryness, sweet fruit and bready malt. Backend is a touch sweet, grape juice, sweet pear and gentle stickiness lingers on. A bit sweet for my tastes overall. The pear makes it that way. Ok.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
