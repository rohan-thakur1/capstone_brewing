2459,"2017-04-29",3.7,"Draft from Whole Foods. Interesting brew for sure. It seemed like a British IPA to me but it its called an imperial pilsner/lager here.

AROMA: Potent hop presence of grassy/spicy/herbal aromatics. Some citrus as well. No distinct malt presence. Clean fermentation profile. 9/12APPEARANCE: Amber/pale orange hue; slightly cloudy body but CO2 visible. Large white froth retains and laces very well. 3/3FLAVOR: Dank hop flavor and bitterness hits the tongue with a thud rather than a crisp sensation. Flavors are of the New England-style IPA sub-genre (grassy/spicy/oniony). Only a minor orange flavor on the backend. No real malt sweetness aside from a slight honey taste, although palette is definitely not off-balanced. Some alcohol emerges right as it finishes. Clean fermentation. 16/20MOUTHFEEL: Medium-full bodied; medium CO2. Mouthfeel is thick, soft, and smooth. Some alcohol warmth from the 8.3% ABV and a brief dry sensation (not astringent per se). 4/5OVERALL IMPRESSION: Another very good NEIPA made even more impressive by the fact its a lager.

La bière est plutôt construite autours des malts jeunes et dune fermentation Lager si bien faite et équilibrée que jai plutôt limpression dêtre en présence dune Ale (pas trop fan de Lager généralement). Un alcool est indéniable en bouche. Le grain est encore une fois joli et équilibré.

2459,"2016-01-07",4.4,"This was poured into a pilsener glass.
The appearance was a slight hazy burnt yellow to golden orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated in a messy fashion. Lacing speckled in a messy fashion.
The smell had a charming sweet to bitter juicy grassy to citrus blend sliding into an underscore of floral bitterness. Hop oils start to come out as it warms. Really nice!
The taste followed the smell nicely. Low dry floral to citrusy aspects burst into the aftertaste and slide into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionable feel as to not wreck the palate. Carbonation seems good for a lager style - enough smoothness but also enough IBU harshness hitting my tongue.
Overall, Ive wanted this for a long time and am so glad I finally found it. One of the best IPLs, Ive ever had and would recommend with its respected food. But for me, I might like to try with some bleu cheese crusted New York strip steak.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

2459,"2015-01-13",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
This lean and citrusy Double IPA shares white grapes, citrus fruit and resinous angles for a dangerously drinkable and flavorful example.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the golden.
-This is not a dank IPA like many others brewed in the northeast.
-The mouthfeel is as svelte as can be for the style.
-The soft effervescence serves drinkability quite well.

India Pale Lagers are a new trend, that in my humble opinion, have not been perfected, because if what you want is a well made hoppy beer, then why not have an IPA, why go to all the trouble to find a lager, but this was different. Instead of trying to hide the fact that its a lager and confuse the palate, this celebrated being a lager, and used the New Zealand hops to great effect.

2459,"2014-02-22",3.5,"Fresh 2014 bottle, drunk 2/22/14So after buying this about 3 weeks ago, I left it in the fridge and it STILL will not clarify. I dont understand! Either this is some very non-flocculent lager yeast (seems very doubtful) or these hop particles just wont settle. Either way, the beer is still hazy, albeit not terribly so and deep sunny-orange colored with a clumpy white head that is well retained (in clumps...). Lots of lacing.Very bitter and piney, this reminds me much of the ABCS (which I didnt rate due to the same annoying resistance to the sediment dropping out). Lush green, leafy resinous hops are backed by a mostly dry pale malt sweetness, while some earthy tones from the hops and a touch of doughiness from the yeast persist. Bright and crisp citrus notes break through on the very end and increase with warming, but its just not 100% bright hop aroma due to the sediment.Pillowy malts provide ample body, as a creamy carbonation aids in balancing the hop assault as well. Pine, grapefruit rind and lots of lemon all build up on the palate, crescendoing in to a bitter, but not obnoxiously so, finish that is robbed of some of its resin sting thanks to the comforting malt texture and sugars. Really nice mouthfeel, not even too out of balance, but I just dont care for the hop flavor really. Its tons of tangy, almost sour pininess and extremely dry ctirus rind. I can see why this gets the rating it does, but not my cup of tea. On the plus side, my second bottle of ABCS has finally gone clear after sitting in the fridge for 2 weeks.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Sweet grape, grapefruit, and peach backed up by a dry spicy character finishing with a floral bitterness in the back of the mouth.

2459,"2014-01-14",3.8,"Pours a hazed golden lager color with yellow hues with the orangey blush of a peach on it. Pastel eye candy. It had a 3 finger head of soft creamy bone white foam that sat like cloud over the top of the beer fo the longest time before it fell. left Grand splotchy thick lace. Oh so pretty.

Nose is righteous! This one has soft ripe peach for a nose with tropical back notes and a little bit of cat pee as it warms. Grass, lemon grass a white grape sweetness that seem to keep each other in check. The kiwi hops remind me of the nelson sauvin hops int heir grapey sweetness and powdery perfumey lightness. The malt is a pinch of sugar.

Taste is well done. My compunction with this style beer is because of the high abv it often feels like these beers are trying to put themselves together with pieces that dont fit. This one is a bit different. It has a light lager type smoothness to the drink that is not undone by the higher abv. There is a touch of warmth from alcohol on the palate and the mouthfeel is medium and smooth. The fruit is ripe and juicy, peach tropical backnotes and lemon grass. There is a wine like sweetness to the drink. The cat pee/dank is scent only and in the drink there is a moderate bitter that takes the back end . Light sugary malt. Crisp but has sweet scents from alcohol that I do not think belong in the lagerbier.

This is one of the beers in this style that actually drinks well. Its not a lager in that you cannot have tow, three or even four. It drinks a bit sweet and with an alcohol presence BUT the fruit and the choice of hops on this have made it work. The pale malt is at its best to smooth everything out an leave the palate dry and even a bit refreshed with plenty of carbonation to excite the tongue.","New York, USA","pinkie"

2459,"2013-12-07",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 13, 2013 So, apparently this is the #1 rated Imperial Pils In the world. Lets see how it stacks up. 

Pours a clear gold color with a nice white head. Big, powerful aromas of juicy tropical fruits in the nose. Mango, pineapple, grapefruit with sugar, your senses just run wild when you smell this beer. Very deep and complex aromas. I could smell this for hours. 

Taste is a slight letdown from what the aroma promised. No, its still pretty damn good, but not up there with the best of the best ipas/dipas Ive ever tasted. Probably the best lager Ive ever had though. Some of the tropical fruit juice is lost in translation from the nose. Some unwelcomed bitterness is present, detracting from the overall experience. Very thin body for a 8.5% beer. The finish is drying, Tylenol like bitterness with only a shadow of the tropical fruit hop expression promised in the nose.

Flavor is lovely sweet melon, some papaya, with piney bitter hops.  Begins sweet but finishes dry and smacking.  Juicy, punchy, and wonderfully refreshing.  These guys know how to make a lager.","Chester, Vermont, USA","Jblauvs"
2459,"2013-01-28",4.6,"À loeil : belle opacité et assez trouble pour une lager (non-filtrée il faut noter)
Au nez : Belle odeur dense de fruits exotiques  (pamplemousse, ananas, papaye)
Au goût : Le nez suit à lentrée avec les agrumes en majorité. Lamertume se faufile ensuite pour rendre la finale très consistante et houblonnée.

2459,"2013-01-18",3.9,"November 12 bottle from a dude on BA - thanks!  Pours a brilliant hazy and glowing yellow/gold with a massive froth of rocky, white foam.  Brilliant appearance.  Aroma is floral hop notes with minimal bitterness and a very clean, dry malt backbone.  Taste is clean, dry balanced hop bitterness over a tight malt profile that shows minimal sweetnes and light grainy, toasted notes.  Very dry and clean mouthfeel.  Great beer and Id love to get a hold of a fresher bottle.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"
2459,"2013-01-05",4.2,"Bottle thanks to jleblanc. Slightly hazy yellow pour with white head. Aroma is peppery, spicy, fruity hops, tons and tons of hops, a real aroma bomb, very enticing.

2459,"2012-12-29",3.8,"500 ml bottle shared by Kan. Thanks. Pours a hazy straw yellow hue, good haze, a bit pale with frothy whitish head atop. Aromas are citrusy, kiwi, and melon. Florals and lemon mix with some pale malts, grain, and gentle sweetness. Nice nose that starts to grow on me, kiwi and citrus. Initial is medium bodied, lighter end of the fold showing big kiwi fruit, lemons, and florals. Some grass, a touch resiny and rind like. Firm solid bitterness up front, some tropical fruit, bread, grain and gumball into the middle. Dry and hoppy finish is firm, citrusy and floral. Kiwi element really does strike that flavor well. A bit sweet intothe middle and backend at times but the finish brings dryness back, a touch of gumball sweetness, melon. Solid beer. Interesting hop, fun to pull the Kiwi out here.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

2459,"2012-12-24",4.7,"Bottle thanks to ILOVESTOUTS, served in a Hill Farmstead stem. 

Pour: Hazy golden yellow. Really vibrant and almost glowing. Big two and a have finger fluffy, snow white head. Leaves tons of clean sticky lacing. Beautiful.

Smell: Big grapefruit, melon, and pine right off the bat. Some light breadyness, but barely. Not super big on the nose but really bright.

Taste: Woah. HUGE grapefruit, melons, and clean pine, followed by a deep citrus bitterness. Just bright all around. This beer is standout. A nice bread dough sweetness just supplements This is no where close to balance, and I love it.

Mouthfeel: It drinks like a Hill Farmstead DIPA. To me, that about the highest mouthfeel praise there is. Incredibly juicy, this beer approaches S&S5 levels of drinkability. Great bitterness, but in the raw fruit sense. Amazing.

Overall: This beer is better than nearly every DIPA Ive ever had. Just a stellar beer in every regard. Jacks Abbey hit a grand slam here. I dont want this again, I NEED this again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","cfrances33"

2459,"2012-12-21",4.0,"500ml bottle.  thanks to shawn. almost through the jack abby lineup - wish i had more... bottle yields a hazy pale golden yellow brown consistency, predominantly opaque actually with little light passing through. the pour is topped with a creamy film of frothy white head.. aroma somewhat muted at first but a seedy juicy fruit flavor definetely rears its head and comes to the forefront.  dank with melon fruitiness once again with that added seedy quality to it that one would normally find from a berry fruit... flavors have more of that seedy dank tropical fruit focus upfront.  quite assertive actually and unique in its own right.  medium bodied or just above with an adequate carbonation level.  odd at first but the hop character developed more after warming. different and good for that matter. none of these jack abby brews have actually disappointed in any way whatsoever.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

2459,"2011-12-05",3.9,"Bomber courtesy of AutumnBeerLove. Thanks again man. 

Pours a hazy, pale golden orange color with a 1.5 finger frothy white head that slowly fades into a lasting ring. Streaks and spots of soapy lacing left behind. 

Slightly earthy aroma with a prominent piney and citrus hop presence along with hints of grass and pale malt. Hints of pine needle, pineapple and citrus ring followed by some light fruit, straw and biscuit. 

Fuller bodied than expected with a very prominent dry hoppy presence up front that lingers over the sweeter notes into a lingering dry finish. Decently bitter with some pine needle flavor but this is countered by some sweet citrus and light fruit notes. slight earthy grass and straw presence add to the earthiness but again are balanced out by hints of apple and pear. Still, hop bitterness dominates the flavor throughout before finishing with some slight heat. 

Overall this beer is really flavorful but it could use a touch more sweetness for balance. There is some subtle heat in the finish but I was shocked to see that the ABV is so high. Fuller bodied than expected for the style but still pretty quaffable. I would love to try this again in the summer.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Pours a cloudy deep straw color bordering on golden with a decent white head that displays minimal retention and lace. Smell comes through with lots of citrus with grapefruit and lemon dominating. Moderate pilsner malt deep underneath. Taste is quite hoppy, lots of citrus with barely any malt to back it up. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a resinous mouthfeel.

2459,"2011-12-03",4.0,"Pours golden orange with a light white head, no retention the aroma is like a Belgian IPA with kiwi hops coming through nicely.

2459,"2011-11-28",4.3,"Poured into a tulip. This brew is is hazy with a honey/wood-like color. Its white head is 1-finger in size and fades to a cap. 

Nice citrusy aroma; primarily grapefruit. Some bready malt is found in there.

The flavor provides a quick hit of orange sweetness up front before grapefruit quickly returns. Some honey is found in the middle providing a faintly sweet malt backbone. Bittersweet grapefruit returns in the end and leaves tart citrus notes lingering on the back of your tongue. 

Mouthfeel is on the thin side. In fact this is when Im reminded that this is still a lager...not for any technical reason, though. It looks like it would carry more weight on the tongue than it does. I have no problem with this, however.

In the end I really enjoyed this. Its clean, direct, flavorful, and I enjoyed it more near the end. My only complaint with this beer is that it doesnt taste all that much bigger or bolder than Hoponius Union. Im not sure if that speaks to Hoponius Unions greatness or a possible downfall in Kiwi Rising. Im thinking the former, as its hard to say anything bad about K.R.","Massachusetts, USA","jbertsch"

2459,"2011-11-22",4.1,"22oz Bottle, purchased at Craft Beer Cellar - Belmont, MA. Cream, dense floral aroma. The hop levels are intense enough to approach complete saturation. The aroma reminds me of hops soaked in vodka. With this new style, DIPL, Im suprised to see something emerge thats completely unique, yet so much like similar beers. This has the big strong lager crispness and smoothness, and even some of the same hop expression, but with a dank, dank, dank citrus hop flavor of DIPAs. A nice marriage. Malt textures are super creamy and smooth, which I enjoy so much in the high gravity hop bombs, it works so well with the intense hop crush. This is great, but Im not sure the hop flavors are really double the Hoponious Union IPL and some drinkability is lost. That said, a really fun strong and hoppy lager that is expertly brewed.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
