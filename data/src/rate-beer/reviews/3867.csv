Medium aroma of malts, caramel, orange, pine, bread, hops and citrus.

Appearance:

Clear/hazy golden/amber beer with heavy yeast and with a slight/medium white/off-white head.

Taste/Palate:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Shamefully it is filtered to oblivion, ruining the appearance and palate more than it should. The aroma is good and the flavour is great.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Smell is intense , bitter ( pine ) hoppy, with a decent amount of aroma. taste is very full, intense pine, corny-malty back, very nicely done ! Hoppyness gives ( besides the pine ) some tropical fruit notes, a good amount of bitterness. The malty base is 100 % what it should be, and so are MF and Carbo. The only minor thing here is the fast-fading aftertaste. but given the ABV, I think its probably normal. Can really stand up agains PTE, I agree. But is it better? im not sure.

3867,"2015-03-08",4.0,"Ive threatened to not like it, because the thing to do seems to be to like it because of who makes it. This happens a lot, and Im feeling rather cynical and anti-establishment today. Of course, when I absorb a truly good brew, theres no helping it.
The cap is cracked with a bottle opener worthy of the bottle, coming straight from Russian River, and I pour a clear, ripe apricot-colored liquid into the glass. The blanket of foam on the surface is soft but dense, and reminds me of a heavily whipped meringue, coating the rim with a deep off-white head. As I drink, it slides down the glass, thick and creamy and never quite making it to the surface of the beer. This is sticky, dank, and the sprucy aroma is already finding its way to my senses.
The aroma is heady grapefruit and resin, a very light backdrop of caramel promising a rich flavor in the beer. I expect a jaw popping bitterness, but enjoy a nicely balanced liquid flowing over my tongue. This is bitter, yes, but also packed with a juiciness that combats that dryness you find in so many IPAs. The medium body is creamy, a bit sticky, and just buzzy enough to keep it from flat, AND from being overbearingly spritzy. The finish is fairly short and enjoyable, the aroma clinging to the taste, keeping it flavorful and very drinkable.

Fresh aromas of tropical, fruity hops, peach, orange and mango, along with honeyed pine and smooth caramel - finely nuanced with hints of citrus peel.

Fresh, fruity hops are hovering above a sweet, honeyed malt backbone, while hints of lime acidity becomes detectable underneath. Hops sting the palate in a refreshing, dry fashion, without ever getting too aggressive. Honeyed, piny, malts wrap up the hops in a well balanced way, along with wisps of whitebread and grass, still, this beer is huge on the bitterness. The taste results in a smooth, dry ending, which is very bitter and hop driven, as malts tend to vanish. Finishes with hops lingering on the palate for a long time, developing a fascinating pleasant depth, as they turn from being fruity to a more bitter, dry impression. A classic IPA, focused on the bitterness, fantastic balanced.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Flavor is similarly introverted. Theres a gaping hole in middle-palate where taste should reside. Some citrus, a little grass and evolving pine. Malt presence almost non-existent.

As if making a decision were not hard enough Toronado put this up against some other world class IPAs. Finally I decided to just pick one and go for it. This being the winner I was rewarded with a fantastic IPA that straddles the session line delicately. I cant wait for the day I actually get to make it to the brewery and try these drafts on site.

Aroma / Appearance - A caramel base and offwhite vanilla head trap about 60% of the light that filters through. Like sticky flypaper it idly sits waiting for unsuspecting rays to float past. Warm earthy hops lend a bright feel that is rich in citrus and resin. Aggressive and effective this does not go for subtlety.

Flavor / Palate - Resin and creamy malt accompany a full bodied profile. Wheat, earthy notes, citrus, and more slowly unfold as they travel over the tongue to the back of the throat. The slow release gives everything a chance to build to an even stronger intensity. The bitterness that results is never harsh or acidic. Instead this is a nice go to beer for transitioning between lighter styles and higher gravity offerings.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3867,"2014-02-24",4.2,"Bottle 20 days old from the brewery continuously refrigerated. Pours light gold with decent lace. The aroma is very lovely fresh light citrus and pine, lighter tropical hops. The flavor is perfectly balanced biscuity sweetness, pithy and piny bitterness. The feel is light and fresh but still has substantial body and tight carbonation with a nice cooling super clean bitter end. It seems so simple and common at first but it is also so remarkably clean, well expressed, and in harmony that only outstanding marks are deserved.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"

3867,"2014-02-20",4.3,"17.25 oz bottle bought at the brewery. Bottled 2/4/14, a little over two weeks ago. Aroma is dank, piney, lemon rind--totally reminiscent of both Plinys. Pours almost clear golden with a thick off-white rocky head with excellent retention; curtains of lace sheet the glass. Taste is more earthy than the Plinys, but it has the same citrusy piney dank character those beers have. Thinner than I expected, which is fine.

3867,"2013-12-24",3.9,"The beer pours a clean, crisp golden color with orange tinges. It forms a head of eggshell white bubbles of a medium size, which sit nicely above the beer at about a half fingers width. In body, the beer is clean and clear with just a touch of haze. On the nose, the beer smells of big orangey pine. Smooth caramel malt blends over the rich hop aroma, giving a sweet kick to the citrus nose. Touches of grapefruit and citrus rind also make their way into the nose to suggest the more bitter qualities of the beer. The smell is not overly pungent, but is nice and nuanced. On the tongue, the beer tastes nicely bitter with a smooth sweet backbone that brings rich balance to the beer. In terms of Pliny, I feel the bitters more in Blind Pig but I know there are less bitters overall than there were in Pliny Citric acidity is also found in the taste, and is light and playful on the sides of the cheeks. In flavor, the beer begins as aspirin bitters and then opens into rich, bitter grapefruit and orange. Wisps of toast and caramel dance on the sides of the palate, but this beer is all about the bitters, which are strong yet balanced. The finish is of fresh orange juice with a touch of bitter aspirin and grass. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium with a gently prickly, higher carbonation and a crisp, snappy mouthfeel. It leaves the mouth dry with a light bitter resin and some saliva in the cheeks. Overall, Blind Pig is a great, classic IPA. It is all about the citric bitters, which I really enjoy. Terrific balance is seen here, similarly to Pliny, but in a way that seems to accentuate the bitters more. Head to head with Pliny, I think I liked Pliny more, this is a solid beer with great flavors, but doesnt really wow me in any way. It drinks like a classic IPA, which it is.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

A pleasantly light sweetness balances the bitterness perfectly. The texture of the beer is creamy like the head. Medium body and mouthfeel is lightly tingly.

Color nearly identical in both - deep translucent copper. Elder is slightly more carbonated in pour. Taste wise, the Pig is more hop forward, with strong grapefruit taste and bitterness on top of a decent malt base. Elder is more balanced, and dare I say nuanced? Strong grapefruit taste still, but a more robust malt base and less bitterness. More substantial mouthfeel in Pliny than Pig. Overall, both are exceptional, but I prefer the Elder.

Pure clear gold colour with a thick cream coloured head.  As I poured it, all I could smell was PNW hops.  As I bring the beer to my nose, its all concentrated grapefruit hoppy.  In the mouth its smooth and well balanced.  Yes hoppy but there is just enough pale malt to keep it in check.  Its very clean.  Not overly bitter on the finish.  Yes big aroma, big hop flavour in mouth, but a clean refreshing finish.  I mean stupidly drinkable.  You could down pints and pints of this stuff.  None of that sweet crystal malt character you get with many US IPAs.  This is clean and showcases the hops perfectly.  Comparing this with Thornbridge Jaipur, BrewDog Punk or Marble Dobber almost seems unfair.  Jaipur probably comes closest. beautifully clean and elegant.

3867,"2013-02-12",4.0,"Draft at backcountry. Surprising that when Russian river was in washington we never seemed to get this. Anyway, light amber, clear, offwhite head dissipates yielding irreg lacing. Aroma is pine and citrus with some caramel maltiness behind it.

Green pine cones, some cortex, sweet malty caramel and glazed sweet tropical mango on the nose. Really fresh and good. It has a average carbonated thin oily mouthfeel. The taste is also dominated by green pine cones and a nice bitter fruitiness. More soft cortex and branches, I get a fruity mango and pineapple thing with a nice balanced hoppy and fruity bitterness. Also, something that reminds me of mixed and thinned out strawberry and raspberry syrup. Scary light drinkable this. I could drink many of these before I had to say stop.

The aroma is herbaceous and grassy with fresh daisies & mild grapefruit. Very pungent & loaded with fresh hops, but also not overbearing or rude in any way. 

The flavor is bracingly hoppy with about a medium level of bitterness. The mix of hops is nice between herbal, lightly oniony, and grapefruity, all balanced just so. The malt character is toasty and ever-present but fairly buried in the hops.

The palate is excellent, sharp, nice high-ish carbonation, but full bodied... or as full bodied as a beer like this ought to be.

3867,"2012-02-27",4.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/13/2010.  Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a tulip. 

The first thing I notice about the appearance is how light and bright it is. More of a golden copper color than the deeper orange and amber colors I expect from West coast IPAs. A tightly formed, impressive off-white head forms upon pouring and has the courtesy to stick around, leaving soft lacing on the glass.

Great tropical aroma! Pineapple dominates, with grapefruit, a bit of lemon, and mango all making my mouth water at the juicy hops I can almost taste.

Somehow the pale malt seems to provide a support structure for the wonderful hops instead of trying to match it. A light malty sweetness compliments the juicy citrus hop flavors that dominate most of each sip. Unlike some IPAs that seem to create conflict between the malt and hops, the sweetness sets the stage for the main performers, the citrus hops. It finishes clean and smooth, the sign that the recipe really holds up.

Somehow this achieves a level of creaminess I would not have thought possible with a single IPA. Great work to keep it carbonated, smooth, and deliciously creamy.

Thank you to my customer, a fellow beer geek who gave me this, very kind. Pours light golden with a thin white head and low retention. Aroma of earthy, resiny, piney hops.

3867,"2011-02-09",3.9,"Got a 500ml bottle in a trade with StumpyJoeJr (thanks, Ryan!). Poured into a tulip glass. My bottle was about a month old at the time.A: Clear gold/pale color - which is unusual for an IPA. Almost completely tepid after pouring. Forms a generous frothy, bright white head which retains pretty well but doesnt lace the glass much.S: Very fruity smelling and similar to Russian Rivers world-famous Pliny The Elder DIPA. Yellow grapefruit and some tropical fruits plus light, perfumery flowers.T: The first few swigs are fantastic and exemplify West Coast-style IPAs with strong, citrusy bitterness. The palate is notable dry, though, and the hops definitely linger. It seems like this beer was dry hopped and maybe a little too much so. Theres also an iced tea-like flavor present to impart some sweetness and make it slightly refreshing up front, but for the most part its a rather simple, 2-chord palate.M: Surprisingly flat and dare I say watery. I would not call this a crisp beer nor a refreshing beer as a whole. For so much flavor it should probably be more full-bodied.D: As is the case with many beers of the style, Blind Pig is quite quaffable at first, until the hops saturate your tongue and dry your mouth out. The thin body makes it a smooth beer to drink, but the dryness becomes cloying turning it into a sipper. Overall a good American IPA and a great example of the West Coast style. Probably a great beer to have with a hearty or spicy meal. The 6.1% ABV is amazing since it has the robustness of a much stronger beer, but I wouldnt recommend drinking more than one bottle at a time.

Taste follows the aroma but is more bitter, and piney on the back.  But mainly a big floral hop taste followed by pineapple juiciness and a piney, bitter dryness.  Some butter and white bread malt but its far behind the hops that dominate this beer through and through.

3867,"2011-01-12",3.6,"500mL bottle poured into a pint glass. Received from a trade with jamesm7485. Bottled 09/30/08.

4.0 A: Very pale orange in color. Ive never seen an IPA so light. Two inches of thick creamy head that retains well and leaves lots of lacing.

4.5 S: Fabulous aroma. Very hoppy with floral and herbal hops. A slight citrus tang with orange most pronounced. Not a lot of malt character.

4.0 T: Tons of hop character, though not very bitter. Bitterness comes out mainly on the finish. Grassy hop flavor with a touch of citrus. Malt bill is lacking in complexity, or at least to the point where it cannot rival the hops.

3.0 M: Medium body though on the light side. Easily the worst attribute of this beer. Lacking the creaminess I want from an IPA, though quite smooth.

4.0 D: The mouthfeel is a bit distracting, but the taste is so good that it makes this beer sessionable to say the least.

The nose shows aggressive Simcoe/Columbus character, along with additional complexity that seems to come from additional late and dry-hopping with other west coast varieties.  The palate shows an extremely refined and complex level of bitterness initially, before showing a level of hop resin and flavor that is unique, even for American-style IPAs.  The finish shows lingering hop flavor, but remains crisp and dry enough to allow the beer to be eminently drinkable.

Pours a clear golden yellowish orange color with burnt orange hues when held to a light source and a 1.5 finger frothy white head that has decent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting ring. Sporadic chunks of lacing left behind.

Chewy body thats on the fuller end of the spectrum with lots of extremely fresh juicy hop flavor and slight bitterness that lingers throughout. As in the aroma, there are lots of tropical and citrus fruit notes as well as some earthy pine needle and slight malt characteristics. Again, Im picking up hits of mango and pineapple as well and grapefruit and citrus peel.

Palate:There is some astringency because of the huge hop bill in this beer, but aside from that its very drinkable, almost creamy. There is a moderate amount of carbonation, that makes this beer refreshing to drink.

Overall:I really enjoyed this beer, the malt gives it a mildly sweet palate upon which the brewer was able to paint great hoppy flavor.

Nose is a mild hop aroma with some grassiness and pine and some citrus, especially oranges and grapefuit. Taste is a wonderful hop bitterness, oranges, grapefuit, pineapple, mango. Bitterness never leaves but never completely overcomes some sweetness in the back that holds as well. Mouthfeel is really interesting rough edges on a medium to light brew - great fun.

The aroma is of strong citrus and pine.
The first sip is smooth with a nice bite from the hops at the finish. Citrus rind is the prevalent bitterness with slight pine.
West Coast IPAs seem to have less body than those here in the midwest which is a nice change from most of the malty IPAs I find here. There is just something about them that makes them different than anything else, not better or worse, just different.

Hazy orange amber, quite a lot of sediments. Medium-sized off-white head.

The flavor is tightly held and centered around exotic fruit aromas, crisp citric hops and grass. Do I also pick up some elder flowers? Medium sweetness and notes of caramel in the background. The finish is slightly perfumy and very bitter with resiny hop notes. 

Moderate body and quite a lot of carbonation.

3867,"2010-05-23",4.2,"Appearance: A bit more golden than most IPAs Im used too. Nice oily sheen across the top of the beer once the creamy white 2 finger head relaxes. Head has good retention and leaves a fine layer of lacing everywhere.

Smell: All floral hop oil goodness here with citrus undertones that range through lemon, pineapple, grapefruit, and orange. Beautiful smelling beer.

Tasting: An excellent tasting IPA with hops dominating and no strong malt profile to counterbalance which is a good thing. Especially considering this low malt high hop style IPA is extremely drinkable and astringency free. Nowhere near as hoppy as Pliny the Elder, but its not a DIPA so it shouldnt be.

Mouthfeel: Perfect carbonation makes this gem creamy and medium bodied. Very nice mouthfeel indeed.

Drinkability: Probably one of the most drinkable IPAs that doesnt disappoint on the hops. Could suck these back all the time if I had more access to them.

A- slightly translucent diluted golden color with a slight orange tint. Pours with a healthy white foamy headwhich eventually fades to 1/2 finger and leaves plenty of lacing all the way down the glass.

S- Wonderful. Big, bright, and hoppy. A perfect blend of pine, citrus, and spicy goodness.

T- The flavor doesnt measure up to the smell but its still decent. Mild spicy hop flavor is the main character upfront with a bit of citrus and grassy flavors in the background. Some pine citrus resiny bitterness comes through for the finish with medium strength and linger for awhile.

P- Medium carbonation and smooth,oily body. Oily characteristics are great, but a bit on the thin side.

It is light and pleasant without a single sour note. The hops are delicious, and the alcohol highlights them well.

3867,"2010-01-19",4.1,"For an IPA to be this well balanced and smooth is a testament to the brewer. While I love Pliny the Elder, its a little more forward on the hops and jumps from the sweetness of the malt to the bitterness of the hop rather suddenly. With Blind Pig however this transition is sliky smooth. Flavors are pretty similar in this beer however if youre looking for a less hop forward easier drinking, but still full of flavor IPA this is it. In reflection Im thinking this smoothness is partly due to the lower ABV as well.

Pours light hazy golden with a big, frothy, white head with rather big bubbles. Fine duration. Nice crisp hoppy aroma, piney, citric, resiny, apricot, melons. Just a hint of crisp malts. Low, but prickly carbonation, very dry mouthfeel. Flavour is nicely hoppy, apricot, grassy, grapefruit, piney. Very hoppy, though the primary flavours arent really that bitter.

The flavor was a little disappointing...somewhat hoppy (not nearly as much as the aroma would make you believe) with some ashy tones, pine tree, with just a touch of toffee.

Aroma: Pine, citrus hops, fresh and juicy hops, grapefruit

Thanks, Nick!  This beer is darn tasty.  My first Russian River beer, and now Im really looking forward to the Pliny you sent me.  I figured I would drink it first from this trade as the label repeatedly warned me not to age it.  Figured I would follow instructions just in case the folks at RR are watching me big brother style.

3867,"2009-07-29",3.8,"9/10/2008:  Russian River Bling Pig looks thick, has a hacy golden color, fine sediment, and an average white head (good lacing).  The aroma has lots of orangy hops, some resi,t toffee malt, and PINEAPPLE.  The bitterness level is high, but not too much.  Its a good blend of bitterness and hoppy flavors dominated by PINEAPPLE.  I think there is also a some Cascade hops.  This beer is definitely more hoppy than malty and thats okay.  This beer has amedim-light body, soft palate, and is really drinkable.  Overall it is a great IPA.

3867,"2009-07-11",4.0,"Appearance: Pours out a lightly hazed, faintly-hued, dull copper body with a wispy, white head.

Smell: Pungent nose dominated by robust hop notes of pithy grapefruit, earthy lemon rinds, pineapple, and flowers.

Taste: Starts with a subtly sweet, restrained pale malt base from which to launch yourself into the hop field. Soon, a full-on barrage of sharply citric hop character and bitterness pushes its way onto the palate. Strong accents of white grapefruit and rustic lemon, with somewhat lesser undertones of fruity pineapple and pressed flowers. Medium-high bitterness. The beer remains assertively bitter all the through (and beyond) the very dry finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. A bit oily, a bit sticky even.

Drinkability: Well, theres no question, its certainly one for the hop fiends. About as reasonably easy to drink as a cuttingly bitter India Pale Ale can hope to be.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Flavor holds the citrus note  lemony, grapefruity, flowery  adding some toasted and toffee malt flavors and a hint of salt.  Finishes cleanly bitter and flavorful. Flavors are surprisingly mild, however.  As far as the palate of Blind Pig, it is light and clean overall, finishing dry.  The head froth on Blind Pig is noteworthy.

Bitterness still accumulates the more you drink it, but that cant really be avoided in an IPA. The hop flavors are perfectly balanced by a nice, crisp amber malt taste. Very refreshing.

3867,"2009-05-11",4.0,"This sampling has been a long time in the running.  You know that ennui you get when youre poring through the RB forums and people are talking about a beer like its an old friend?  Swapping stories and notes, and then doing it again the next day, and the next?  And you feel like the kid in the corner of the playground, exiled but not with malice?  Yeah, I hate that feeling.  So it was about time I gave this Russian River brew a try.  A thick wide head springs up from a calm pour, like political demagoguery - reliably overreactive.  Bubbles spring out from the center of the pours drop point, casting a net over the moderately clear, hypnotically rich looking orange beer.  The Blind Pig takes the initiative with a hoppy punch, followed by the tantalizing aromas of roast chicken skin/fat, fermenting pizza dough, a cluster of grains and barley.  The flavor capitalizes on this opening act with another round of mild but complex flavors beginning with apple and later indulging in cascades of hunger-satisfying grains.  When I like an IPA, its generally because its graciously included some sweets to offset the bitters, but the Blind Pig is certainly not a sweet beer.  Its an appetizing beer, and appetizing IPAs are very few and far between.  So this is something of a gem to me, and definitely tops my list of IPAs snatched away from the temping jaws os hop-bombery and steadfastly back into the realm of palate enriching drinkable nirvana.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

3867,"2009-05-01",4.3,"500mL bottle from Beerstore.co.nz, bottled in December 08. Poured off the yeast, it is a hazy golden amber colour, with a frothy off white head. 
Aroma, wow. I havent smelt hops like this before in NZ. A lot of pine needle, which is new to me. An orange peel citrus underlies the strong piny aroma. The malt brings a little caramel to the aroma. 
Unsurprisingly; the flavour is dominated by piny, pleasantly bitter, resiny hops. Wow, now I know what resiny means. Hop flavour coats my mouth, leaving a long lasting pleasant bitterness which screams DRINK ME MORE! I left this out to warm for 1.5 hours, yet I still cant really detect any malt flavour through the huge hops, perhaps the Pliny the Elder will improve on this aspect, otherwise I cant really fault this beer.

Pours a dull golden straw color with a solid inch of foamy white head that sticks around forever, lacing the hell out of the glass.
Nose starts with a big smack of grapefruit- noticeable from a foot or so away from the glass right after pour.  Aroma follows with oranges and tangerines.  Pungent, earthy, and fruity.
Flavor is immediately unique.  Plenty of that fruit from the nose, with grapefruit taking the forefront as it often does.  Earthy pine and resin notes fill out the hop profile.  Superb bitterness-immediately aggressive, remains thoughout the flavor, never overpowering.  Hop character overall shows an interesting flatness- tons of hops, but never overdone in any one aspect.  Minimal sweetness or malt flavors, and the palate/finish are superbly dry and clean, with only lingering hints of bitterness.

pours a hazy orange gold iced/ tea color with a soft white head.

lots of citrus on the nose... grapefruit, orange and pineapple blend with caramel and non resinous pine. the flavor is the same... tart pineapple (not the golden ones), tangerines, caramel/maltiness, grass, floral hops and an earthy finish which is persistently parching. very clean.

pleasant medium body with a creamy mouth feel. the malts are balanced nicely  hoppy dryness and near bitterness.

3867,"2009-02-01",4.5,"In short: A fantastic very crisp and dry IPA.  Amazing.
How: Bottles.  Many times from many people (Kegbear and others).  Thanks a millon to you all and keep these coming!!!  Always consumed fresh immediately upon reception.
The look: Clear golden blonde body topped by a medium white head
In long: Nose of orange peels, citrus fruits and distant pine-needles.  Taste is focussed on high-drinkability.  Side-by-side with Pliny the Elder I thought the Pliny was a lot more resinous while the Blind Pig was a lot more on the dry side with cedar and sawdust flavours.  Sweetness is more on the crisp honey/caramel while the Pliny had a rich caramel.  Side-by-side with the Pliny Elder the Blind Pig clearly didnt have the complexity or the Elder but its dryer character almost makes-up for it.  A very nice beer I can really relate to, although Ive never been called blind before.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Not in your face hoppy, but so smooth and balanced and flavorful - grapefruit, lemony citrus, pine, cali bud, doughy bready malt.

Nose is intense and wonderful with lots of citrus noting tangerine, apricot, and orange zest; other notes inlcude some resinous pine and maybe hints at grass.  Flavor is not the same with the citrus disappearing a bit; notes include tangerine, light pine resins, and very dry grass.  Very high bitterness comes through drying the beer out in a long flavor progression; by the finish, the dry grass and high bitterness almost become bark-like.  Palate is DRY, moderately full, a bit sticky, and not quite lively.  The nose was great but the bitterness is overdone, it dries the beer almost completely out.

3867,"2008-11-20",3.8,"So Ive had this out of a two month old bottle that I deemed too old to rate.  If Russian River is nice enough to bottle date I will respect their wishes and not rate a non-fresh sample.  I also had a one month old sample.  Debatable but again I deemed it not fresh enough.  So after having a very fresh pint at Toronado and a super fresh pint at the Brewpub I think Im qualified to finally give this a proper rating.  Pours a light, hazy orange with a nice fluffy white head.  Intensely citrusy hop nose.  Loads of mango, pineapple, peach and orange.  The intensity rivals that of Pliny though this lacks the pungent, dank Columbus-type edge that Pliny has  this is all fruit.  The aroma is the best thing of this beer.  Taste is super hoppy, harshly bitter, balanced between sweet and dry.  The bitterness is over the top and slightly astringent, it certainly lacks the cleanness and drinkability of Pliny.  While this is a good IPA I cant help but think this is highly overshadowed by its bigger brother.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

There are also some citrus notes across the palate with grapefruit coming forward the most.  The pine and somewhat resin coated hops are predominant.

Tons of tropical citrus fruits are right there to greet you and continue all the way through.  Along the way, plenty of pine pokes its head up to say hello.  And finally an earthy finish rounds it all out.  This is definitely an exploration of hops.

Clear amber orange with a one finger white head, slowly fading to a thick film and sheet of lace on the glass.  Aroma has loads of grapefruit pulp and rind, along with some bitter pine needles and clean caramel in the backend.  The flavor is much the same with added pine needles, and a fair amount drier and more bitter than the RR IPA.  As far as I know they dont vary the hops, but this particular batch is incredibly fruity and amazing.  Other batches are a bit more dank and ""weed""-like.  Bitterness peaks around a 6 in the dry finish.  Typical of the West Coast to deprive your senses of malt character, but the purpose of IPA?s was not for the malt.  Burps pine needles.  Light to moderate prickly carbonation with a medium body.  I must bump my rating up a bit, as this batch (4/04/09 rerate) is phenomenal.

Well, now I’ve ticked off both Blind Pigs. (Leavenworth being the other). This one was maybe 10 weeks old when I received it in trade, but it was still really, really good. I’d be eager to try even fresher.  I think the aroma would really come into its own at that stage. Still, lovely citrus hops without a heavy malt base, just nice and toasty instead of overdosed on the caramel malt. Sort of a mellowed out Pliny the Elder,  superbly drinkable.

Notes of rindy clementine and sweet oranges meld well with lighter notes of candied oranges, wet grass, pine needles, peaches and apricots.  A more intense rindy note meets the tongue, reminiscent of pink grapefruit.  Prickly carbonation breaks up the hoppiness.  A mild caramel base works to balance the hop onslaught, but comes up a bit sharp.  I would boost the caramel in this to balance the insanely complex and bitter hops.

3867,"2008-09-28",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
A deft flock of crisp biscuity malts grazes the greenest hoppiness; its citrusy, floral, spicy and resinous crops provide a seemingly eternal string of bouquets for this quintessential West Coast IPA experience.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam crowns the hazy blond-beige.
-The hop profile is so eloquent and so engaging, its hard not to be attracted to.
-The long bitterness is quite sandy and redolent of the Simcoe variety.
-Although I greatly appreciate Pliny The Elder, I would drink a lot more Blind Pig if it were available to me.
-I like the fact that the malts are crisp and not too sweet; this increases drinkability and lets the perfumy hops express themselves fully.

3867,"2008-09-27",3.5,"Bottle. Nice enough West coast IPA that is not as hopped-up as some. Still, plenty of grapefruit bitterness to scrape the tongue long into the finish. Sweet backbone to balance the 70 ibus, though the sweetness blunts the hops so that they arent as crisp as some West coast style IPAs. Hazy dark yellow pour with appealing and lasting white head. The aroma is hoppy with notes of grapefruit, orange, resin, pine. The malt aroma is light to medium with notes of toasted grain, caramel and a hint of rye. The flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter. The sweetness carries through to the finish (orange juice), but the bitterness intensifies a bit (unsweetened grapefruit juice). Medium body with a velvety texture. Lively carbonation. Thanks Aubrey.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"

3867,"2008-09-26",4.1,"Rating per .5L bottle.  I’ve had this on tap in Santa Rosa and it’s much better than the bottled version.  A beautiful honey-colored liquid pours out to form a slightly hazy body and a bountiful, off-white head that forms a lumpy landscape, eroding into thick rings and blotches on the side of the glass.  The aroma is magnificent, whispering ""surely this was dry-hopped,"" and wafting flowers and citrus blended with pine, light honey, and a sweet french roll.  Sadly the bottled version is rather flat--at least my bottle is--but we have a medium body, extremely light carbonation, watery.  The plus is that it’s still incredibly refreshing, and there are enough hops to give the illusion of a dry finish.  I taste a nice mouthful of hops, not a nasty one, that is strong but not overly so with a nice blend of pine, citrus, and a touch of fruitiness for hops.  Hops are matched with a bit of sugar, a bit of that bread we smelled earlier, and some pollen.  In the mouth it’s decently balanced, and the aftertaste is dry and well-hopped, boasting of grapefruit, pine, and pollen.  Easy drinking, delicious, refreshing...I’m very fond of this IPA.  I recommend finding it on tap though re: carbonation issue.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"

Stinky wet dog and dying cheese aroma, back in there somewhere is a run of grass, but it just comes out smelling a bit like peanut butter, ass and bananas to me. Pours a slightly hazed golden amber, with a beautiful head of lacing white foam. Continuing wet animal and bitterness. This tastes JUST like the disgusting hop bomb that I made a little over a month ago. Wet dog, salty popcorn butter, and compost. In the flavor, hops are able to climb through a little more, but only as a piney bitterness. The hop cheese smoothes out a little, but still perks up in the finish. Hops are fine, I guess, but I really dont have any interest in considering them amongst the weird stale hop disaster. Without much hop flavor, this seems needlessly bitter, considering that the malt isnt really keeping up with the unbalanced bitterness.

In a re-calibration of my palate, Im coming to learn that cheesy, stale, high co-humulone iso-valeric hops create a sensation for me that I had been miscorrectly identifying as diacetyl, which I still cannot, apparently taste. This beer has some funky stale cheese hops going on and I mis-interpreted that. Much less of a brewing flaw than the incorrectly identified diacetyl problem. Re-scored.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

The flavor had a little more maltage than the aroma indicated, with bready and other pale malts present.. bitterness was plentiful with grapefruit and a hay/pine cross all over.. finished bitter with less specific character and some alcohol warmth.

3867,"2008-08-26",3.0,"Bronze-hued golden. Healthy dollop of persistent white cream laces nicely. Resinous and grapefruit-peel hop aromas reside over artfully restrained nut- and caramel-tinged malts. Hints of aspirin, tangerine and peach skin. Soft and fluffy carbonation. Unfiltered. Hops immediately unleash their resinous sting on the palate. Subdued yet bright pockets of airiness surge forth to offset the tacky oils while briefly unveiling softer, juicier dabs of mango, assorted melon, overripe peach, and grapefruit flesh. Bitter resurgence of hops evokes thoughts of pungent blood oranges and salted grapefruit rind, though the resin stops just shy of becoming fatiguing. Raspy notes of aspirin and chalk further tarnish the underlying succulent hop character which is just begging for attention. Malt remains steady, though always relaxed in its supportiveness, gently imparting pillowy textures of straw, nuts, and caramel. Finishes with hints of sharp candied lemon zest which does its best to keep the oily hops from becoming overly oppressive. While undeniably well-constructed (malts are clean, composed and soft, along with some nicely integrated esters), there is still a bit too much emphasis on the yeast and resin and not enough on bright hop flavor. Middle of the road.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

I could smell the hops as I walked down the hall, holding the glass in front of me.  Now as I sniff deeply, the sharpness is blended with a nice fruity odor.  Blueberry?  Constant flow of bubbles, like champagne.  The lacy slick is actually strengthening as I type, staining the side of the pint glass when I pick up the brew.  Sharp hoppy sharp.  No fruity taste in that first drink.  Long lingering aftertaste is toned but still bitter. I can feel it in my cheeks and gums and lips. As I continue I can start to pick up a bit o’ honey flavor.

Ahhh, we’ve finally come full circle. Many years ago I had my first Blind Pig in a hot tub in San Diego. Wowza, did it blow my socks off. I just remember how awfully bitter it was!
Finally, the pig has been ressurected.

Pours light, hazy gold, with a one inch head of dense white foam.
Retention is moderate and clingy lacework throughout.

Aromatics are pungent and floral.
Tangerines, pine sap, grapefruit, apricots, melons, and light, fresh malt.
Tropical fruits in a Northern forest.

Medium bodied, with a crisp, dry mouthfeel. 

Bright, juicy hops lead off the pallet. Pink grapefruit, spruce resin, orange pith, and melon rind. 
Drying, smooth bitterness steps forward and some mild alcohol is present when looked for.
Loaded with fruit and pine, super dry and lightly malty.

Finishes with lingering citrus fruit pith, a bit of pine bark, and plenty of firm, drying bitterness.

Better than I remember, and certainly my bitterness threshold has changed since the original.

3867,"2008-08-08",4.2,"Bottled 07/09/08.  A misty apricot orange and a thin whitecap.  Resinous and wet cannabis and lychee rind aroma; grassy, bitter and herbal; a gorgeously damp sagebrush and citrus rind hoppiness with a sparse dusting of pepper.  Perfect hop character, and a calm sweetness of almond and cotton candy and sugar cookies.  Its pretty and pristine.An abrasive pinecone bitterness intimates a sharp edge in the immediate flavor; it hits with a violent crunch, like a sudden waft of wet pine smoke in the throat.  Softly, a smooth fruitiness of apricots, pears, and tangerines lends a perfectly complimentary brightness and sweetness, and it stays almost totally settled on this sunny orchard sensation; the bitterness is pure pine and hemp, lingering on grapefruit only for a moment, before those glowing sweet citrus and stone fruit oils wash over.  Freshest hops.  As it warms, some wildflower honey and doughy malt presents, calmly, and cleanly; its inarguably impressive how well-drawn the hop and malt characters are individually, and how beautifully they bleed into each other as the beer unfolds.Soft, medium palate, lightly sticky with resins and floral honey.  Gentle carbonation.  Finish is green herbal bitterness, of cannabis, pine, and sage, just lightly vegetal.  While its perfectly refreshing and its hop presence is so attractive and forceful, it gets just lightly astringent with raw greenness and celery crunch at the very end, and so it must remain as a world-class, if not highest peak, example.

3867,"2008-08-08",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 19, 2008 <b>Bottled July 22, 2008; Sampled August 7, 2008</b>
Pours into my New Belgium Globe glass with a nice pungent scent and a two-finger thick, pale tan colored head that has some stickiness to it.  The beer is a hazy amber hue that shows a more copper hue when held up to the light.  Sticky grapefruit notes mix with sweet lychee notes, which are offset in the finish by a sticky herbal note that takes on overtones of hemp oil, peppery sage and just plain, green, hop-stink.  Vivaciously hoppy, this has the fruit character that I like in a good IPA as well as the balancing, dank hoppiness that is needed for balance.  Quite a nice example of a beer that captures the essence of concentrated hop nectar.  No real malt aromatics are noticeable, if you really dig for them there is just a wisp of toasty, pale malt, but only just.

Sharply bitter up front, then the mouth coats the palate and helps to carry the hop flavor, but the bitterness kicks back in towards the finish and lingers on in the mouth with an herbal edge to it.  After my first sip I feel like I was just chewing on some fresh hops.  Citrus & hop-fruit flavors of grapefruit, bergamot oil, lychee and bright tangelo make a significant showing, but are ultimately engulfed by the palate coating, herbal bitterness that is what is left lingering on in the palate after each sip has passed down my throat.  Impressively quaffable, this has some heft to it with enough body to just carry the hops, but remains light enough to be drinkable like a good IPA should.

This is definitely a beer for the hopheads out there.  It definitely doesn’t pull any punches and is aggressively hoppy.  If in the mood for an aggressive hop experience this definitely fits the bill.  It doesn’t get overly harsh and it is just so dang quaffable.  This is much more aromatic and hop flavorful than the draught sample I had previously.

<b>Sampled at Lucky Baldwin’s IPA festival, June 2007</b>
Pours with a very fluffy, initially three-finger thick, pale, tan colored head that sits atop an orangish, lightly hazy, copper colored brew.  The aroma is sharply citrus-like in character, but a backdrop of green, hop aromatics reminiscent of menthol, pine and an herbal note reminiscent of green basil and hemp.

The beer tastes quite dry and this really accentuates the biting hop notes.  The beer is quite smooth, or without much carbonation as the pour from the tap seems to have knocked out most of the carbonation.  Flavors of orange peel and tart grapefruit are joined by herbaceous, green, dank, hop flavors; the last of these really linger on in the finish along with a not-overwhelming, but persistent bitterness and a green astringency.  As the beer warms a bit I begin to pick up some menthol-like notes as well.

While this is quite hoppy (both the citrus side and the herbal side of the hop), it still manages to be quite smooth and drinkable.  The appearance of this beer is perfect (albeit this is somewhat arbitrary) as I really can’t ask for more; it has a nice light haze that let you know copious amounts of hops were used here).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3867,"2008-08-06",4.1,"Thanks to DTM for the bottle from Monument in Concord, CA.  This brew had a nice hoppy hit on the palate (pure citrus, mainly grapefruit).

The smell is huge on floral and citrus hops - grapefruit and pine just jump out of the bottle when it’s opened.  The taste is hops galore with grapefruit stinging the tongue with bitterness up front and pine resins lingering on the palate at the finish.  There is a hint of the bready hop background, but the hops steal the show here.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and sticky with hop oils.  This is one of the best IPAs I have tasted and especially enjoyable for hopheads like me.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

The flavor is smooth and crisp as well, with a nice balanced hop presence, although pretty strong for a regular IPA.

Very nice nose, which is dominated by very bright woodsy hops, with other light notes of resin and lemon from the hops.  Flavor hoppiness and bitterness is very bold and impressive, and lingers in the finish very well.  The hops are raw, pure, well utilized and again, they linger well after the swallow.  Flavor hops are similar to the nose and can best be described as very woodsy.  A minor critique, it doesn’t have a lot of body, but the finish makes up for it.  Overall, really nice IPA.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
3867,"2008-07-29",4.0,"Bottle, barely two weeks old.  Pours a very lightly hazy orange-amber color.  A frothy, off-white head settles to a thin, asymmetrical, bubbly layer.  Sticky lacing coats the glass in an organic honeycomb pattern.  The aroma shows fresh, juicy orange and grapefruit, hints of apricot, bitter, grassy hops, and a lightly toasty toffee malt background.  The flavor packages those same elements into an ultra-clean, refreshing package.  The citrus asserts itself a bit more, with big-time grapefruit and a touch of lemongrass shutting out any hints of apricot that the nose foreshadowed.  The toffee malt imparts just the right amount of sweetness, without getting in the way of the hops or muddling things up.  Medium-full bodied and moderately carbonated, the finish is on the dry side and very clean, lending supreme drinkability.  This is definitely an ""everyday"" cousin of Pliny the Elder.  Another damn fine beer from Russian River.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Taste is very crisp overall, with a hoppy bitterness and grapefruit character.  Not overly flavorful and didn’t blow me away exactly, but an extremely solid and well made beer.

Very warm aftertaste. Some ginger and nutmeg with fresh hops. Medium bodied, almost full bodied. If I were rating for style, I would say that this is more like an Imperial IPA, but I’m not.

S- Smell was of piney hops with a small amount of a citrus kick. The hops smelled like the amazing scent of adding hops to a wort boil, almost no other IPA that ive had has recreated this smell

T- Taste was very hoppy for a standard ipa, with blended citrus notes. Sweet pine taste seemed to dominate followed by a rich grainy fullness.

M- Very crisp and carbonated but not as viscous as some of RRs other offerings. Went down very smooth.

D- This beer was very drinkable. It did seem to me that it was stronger than 6 percent but none the less it went down fairly easy.","California, USA","Lothore"

The nose was filled with grapefruit, Rouquefort cheese and a touch of anise.  In the mouth it had medium density, a smooth texture and was wonderfully balanced.  The hops are very well balanced by some malt that leads to a beer with a bitterness/dryness but also a touch of sweetness.

Intense floral aroma off the the  head of sap, resin, pine needles and a slice of fresh cut grapefruit.

Nice light/medium body with firm carb thats actually a bit raw. Huge caustic resin and pine notes scour the tongue all the way across, and leave a deep bitter resin cling behind. The raw carb exacerbates the harshness of the chosen hops. Certainly not the bitterest beer Ive had, but the light body, harsh carb, and single-mindedly resiny/piney notes of the hops make it quite a tour de force. As refreshing as a hard slap in the face from a beautiful woman.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Draught pint at PP Carlsbad on 3/24/07 while waiting in line for pizza.Very nice pale-golden body has a hint of straw and a medium amount of white head.  Slight chill-haze, modestly carbonated.Damn!  Thats a dry and very nicely dry-hopped aroma.  No malt to speak of, or rather, none that gets in the way of the hops.  Clear and brisk lemon-lime, with even a hint of spiciness, followed by dry, but not overly acidic grapefruit.  Some light pale malts provide a hint of sweetness, for balance, akin to powdered sugar atop nectarines (mixing with the hops), with a pinch of some biscuit notes.  The rest is just pure aromatic, dry-hopped heaven, very fresh, crisp and in your face, though not overdone on acidity.  Light herbal notes, with stronger wintergreen and dry melon.  Phew, thats nice!Perfectly attenuated, with malt left for a smooth texture, but only minimal, lightly crisp, grainy flavors.  More nectarine, lychee, lemon, grapefruit and soft pine on the finish.  Tight carbonation for a draught beer, leads to an almost creamy mouthfeel which further helps balance the very dry nature of the beer.  Dry, yellow fruitiness lingers on, with melon and lychee.  Just delicious stuff and incredibly drinkable for its dryness.  No alcohol or flaws, of course.  Great restraint on the bitterness/acidity.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

This is straight up, O.G. West Coast IPA style. Lots of grapefruit and pinestraw. Good body with a clean, crisp and pretty dry finish.

This beer is a classic example of AIPA just bursting with hop aromas, flavors, and bitterness. This beer pours to a beautiful, slightly hazy, orange color, with a creamy white head, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is just so zesty, and fragrant. It explodes with big lemon peel/citus and piney hop aromas. The palate is firm, with some good sweet/pale malt, paired with lots of really good, tangy, lemon/citrus hop flavor. Blind Pig finishes with more good sweet malt and tangy hops up front, then ends with a big, mouth puckering bust of lemon/citrus hop bittereness that lingers. Outstanding AIPA, one with such character, yet so drinakble. A fantastic pint at the brewpub, one to sip and savor, and to enjoy with the delicious brick oven pizzas served at Russian River.

3867,"2006-04-07",3.7,"Draught at Liars ClubPours a hazy yellow colod with light, thin white head and moderate lacing. The nose is ripe and citrusy with some hops and some tangy grassy malt notes. The flavor is rich with a thick body and some caramel malts. A nice IPA, right around the par of regular IPAs in this area. Double IPA? San Diego IPA? Sorry, time has passed. The finish is creamy, balanced. Nice upfront floral hops. I like.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3867,"2006-04-07",4.0,"Pours with an orangish-gold body toped by a medium thick head with good lacing.  Its bitter and hoppy with notes of citrus and pine, and a very slight underlying sweet malt note.  Medium bodied, smooth and a touch dry.

3867,"2006-04-03",3.9,"Having old friends remember the original, I was very excited to finally try the mother of the pliney.  But to my dismay, it didnt hold up, but 10 years ago, this would have been nice.  Pours a clean orange/yellow hue with aromas of pine, and citrus.  Flavors of the same with a nice bitterness.   For being 6%, this does make a nice session brew.","San Diego, California, USA","Sickboy282"
3867,"2006-04-03",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 6, 2009 Tap @ Liars Club. Not much notes on this one but I remember it being amazingly fresh & spicey, with a fresh, clean floral, piney hoppiness on the body. Nice fresh malt flavors & grapefruit. It was a medley of flavors that were in no way homoginized together. Very nice, clean tasting medium bodied IPA. 9/6/09 Im upping this 2 points to a 4.

Sweet lemon, brash grapefruit supported by a solid caramel malt backbone, clover, grass with more of the grapefruit in the finish.  Medium to full body, gentle, cask carbonation.

3867,"2006-02-26",3.5,"The third offering in a continuum of Russian River IPAs bottled unofficially by BA RedwoodGeorge from a 5 gallon keg into 22 oz. bombers, the beer came out paler than the two bigger Plinys but had a little more carbonation, and a bigger head.  The aroma was much milder than I had anticipated, with a floral-citric hop smell vaguely reminiscent of Mangos. The taste was citric, sugary, and a little soapy.  Body was light and airy, and the hops faded quickly after each sip.  Like the rest of Russian River IPAs, this was lighter in body than the strength on the label suggested.  Unlike the bigger beers, the lightness of the body had a slightly detrimental effect on the single IPA, where more character is usually better than less.  An easy to drink beer, that left me wishing it was a little less simple.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

3867,"2006-01-26",3.4,"This beer is the most drinkable IPA I have ever had, which isnt necessarily a good thing. I would rather it have more flavour and be less drinkable. The IBUs tasted like they were only 35 or so, and the aroma was very lacking for an IPA. There was nearly zero head retention. There was a pretty colour and the ale poured nicely, but it was just too thin of a beer in my opinion. After all, IPAs are not supposed to be session beers.

Taste it, already...slides on board the palate assuredly and provides the same fresh, vibrant hoppy flavor that blessed the nose.

Not too anything, this, and just right with all the appropriate ingredients, especially for the hopheads in the house....medium-bodied, with a lightly bitter, fruity finish...holy crud, I could spin every superlative off the top of my head and still feel like Ive missed a few...every IPA Ive tasted from Russian River has been amazing, and this continues that trend...if Vinnie is capable of making a bad one, I dont want to know...","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

3867,"2005-09-23",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 24, 2005 Draught at Brickskeller in DC: The lighting in Brickskeller sucks, so my appearance comments may not be accurate.  I did the best I could in the conditions.  I was lucky to get a pint of this immediately folowing a pint of the IPA, so I could contrast the two.  Moderately hazy golden yellow with a definite bronze-orange tinted body.  Medium white head that is somewhat foamy and does have quite the retention of their plain IPA (though its still nothing to scoff at).  The aroma has more pungent citrus hops than the IPA (which is more pine/grass), but theres still the usual subjects of pine and floral hops with a tiny hint of sweet malt in here that seemes to almost have a bit of dry caramel, almost like munich malt.  The taste has mostly bitter citrus hops at first, with some light pine and floral hops as well, but the more citrus and grapefruit flavors are backed up with a sweeter malt base than the IPA.  Towards the middle one can actually taste just a hint of malt (sweet pale malt, not grainy, with a faint tough of caramel).  Finish is dry (not a surprise from RR), crisp, and has plenty of lingering hops.  Medium bodied, moderate-medium carbonation, dry but showing some signs of malty sweetness.  I really enjoyed the presence, if faint, of the small amount of flavorful malt in this.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"
