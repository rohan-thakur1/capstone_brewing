3446,"2017-05-30",4.0,"(From notes): Bottle shared at a friends birthday shindig. Pours jet black with almost no head. The lovely scents of strawberries/vanilla/chocolate all waft up from the snifter along with a tiny bit of roast malt. While still nice, the strawberry aroma is a touch artificial when compared with the rest of the nose. Holy cavity, Batman! -- an intense, nearly overpowering sweetness dominates the flavor before the same Neapolitan blend makes its presence known. The proper components are all there -- it really does taste remarkably like a Neapolitan ice cream sandwich -- with a creamy vanilla and slightly boozy finish. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel. Massive kudos to Cycle for achieving the desired affect, but the overt sweetness is almost too much for more than a few sips.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
3446,"2017-04-29",4.7,"Bottle at the radikal whale slaying. Thnx to Eric ! Pours black. Smell is intense, vanilla, some strawberry notes. some chocolate notes. Taste is very full, sweet, very dark grains, chocolate. Strawberry notes. sweet, lactose. aftertaste is pure vanilla icecream. very unusual tastes in a beer, yet it works very well. Pretty far from a traditional beer, but right in the timezone it should have been released. Whilst Omnipollo set the example of intensely flavored desert style beers, this one hit a homerun by creating the ultimate desert beer.","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

3446,"2016-11-22",4.7,"Shared at the Hoppy Pub by the courtesy of Rouhlas, thanks so much Nick. 
Black with brown head. Aroma of Roasted malts, fruits, some coffee, caramel. What a great taste ! Starts with the typical imperial stout standard flavours but it turns into a flavour party...Biscuit is here, vanilla, cocoa, strawberry, like ice cream liquor. So great...
Silky and gentle carbonated beer. I wish to have again the chance to enjoy this gem !","Thessaloniki, GREECE","skullgeorge"

3446,"2016-10-21",4.5,"Jeez... Pour pitch black with a ring of light brown head. 
Aroma is pretty nasty with all kinds of goodness going on. Raspberry/strawberry - milk chocolate, vanilla, slight oak, marshmallow, slight oak, candy candy. Boozy milkshake with cararamel twirls and a candied cherry dipped in liquid marzipan on top. Slight charred something something. 
Taste is rather sweet, with faint bitter notes. Slight boozy 
Semi full bodied, with a very fitting flat carbonation.","Aalborg, DENMARK","MotherBrother"
3446,"2016-10-21",4.6,"Dangerous Bottleshares XL forealz edition. ....... Okay lets do this. Pours pitch black with a tiny brown head. Aroma of literally strawberry ice-cream, sweet chocolate, strawberry milkshake, vanilla, butterscotch, bourbon notes and dark sweet fruits. The taste is sweet with notes of a bourbon, vanilla strawberry milkshake. Also sweet chocolate, bourbon soaked dark fruits and molasses. Again cycle managed to do an insanely flavored imperial stout once again. Like the hazelnut, this is transparent and extremely naughty.","Aarhus, DENMARK","RasmusOtt"
3446,"2016-10-21",4.6,"Pitch black pour with no real head. The nose is crazy. Strawberry milkshake, chocolate almond milkshake, vanilla strawberry marshmallows. Almost cant believe this nose. This aroma profile actually all over the taste too. Sweet but I have a big sweet tooth so were good. What it tries to do it does really well. Totally impressed and the mouthfeel is perfect, big and oily with smooth prickly carbonation. Sweet aftertaste balanced with chocolate bitterness in the end. Insane brew.","DENMARK","Hoprider"
3446,"2016-10-21",4.7,"Bottle @ Killem All 2016. Pours pitch black with a small mocha head. Aromas of sweet strawberries, vanilla, marshmallow, sweet milk chocolate, subtle roast, cocoa. Taste is FUCKED. Neapolitan icecream for sure. Huge strawberry, vanilla, marshmallow, fudge, sweet chocolate, light roast, cocoa, bourbony oak in the back. Holy fuck. Perfect execution.","Aarhus N, DENMARK","Klimaet"
3446,"2016-10-21",4.4,"Bottle from trade with Matt at Dangerous Bottleshares XL 4Realz Edition Motherbrother, Hoprider and Aaron. Pours a pitch black with a small, tan head. Aroma has ice cream. Like.. Strawberry ice cream, vanilla, milk chocolate, strawberry milkshake, light roast. What is dis shiiiet!?
Taste is just like a chocolate strawberry milkshake, same body, same sweetness, same lactose, same fruit, and most of all; Same body! Creamy, fluffy, thick. Slight roasty bitter finish, which is the only sign of being a beer in the taste. Average carbonation. One of the weirdest beers ive tried in a very long time! Crazy execution, but it doesnt really leave me craving for more..","Aarhus C, DENMARK","Vestergaard"
3446,"2016-10-21",4.7,"Bottle @ Dangerous Bottleshares XL feat. Motherbrother, hoprider and FranzBC. Pitch black with a small dark tan head. Wow!

3446,"2016-08-27",4.8,"Bottle at north vs south tasting. Poured a thick deep black colour with a Nice beige head. Nose is deep sweet chocolate, fudge, molasses, sweet ripe strawberry juice, icecream, light sweet barrel notes, dessert. Taste is sweet chocolate upfront, vanilla, Cream, cookies, leading to a sweet strawberry finish without getting overwelming. A light sweet bourbon finish in the back. This is one of the most extreme beers i have had. It lived up the hype. Incredible how they manage to get all the icecream flavors in a wonderful barrel aged stout. Lovely","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
3446,"2016-08-09",4.8,"Shared at an Ann Arbor get together at Jeffs on July 20. 22 oz bottle that I never thought I would get to try. Holy shit! The pour is jet black. This is used motor oil in the glass with a small dark brown head that hangs around as a thin ring. The aroma is really awesome. All of the strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla come through in a dried ice cream form. Its like Dippin Dots. There is a light bourbon barrel quality to it, a nice molasses and a fudginess. The only thing I can knock on the aroma is the booziness is a bit strong for the sweet bits. The flavor is spectacular. There is a huge Neapolitan ice cream happening, with a big fudgness and a sweet molasses. Its unbelievably complex. Everything just balances so well. The mouth feel is the incredible levels that 3 Sons imparts on their stouts. There is a heavy thickness that almost requires chewing. The carbonation is soft and only makes it cling to the mouth a little further. The aftertaste is lingeringly fudgy and full of molasses, with a bright dried Neapolitan ice cream lingering behind. This is absolutely spectacular.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3446,"2016-07-13",4.6,"Bottle. Dark pour with lighter head. Chocolate, vanilla and strawberry, sweet malts aromas. Flavors are strawberry first, some chocolate, vanilla, other sweetness.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
3446,"2016-07-11",4.5,"22oz bottle. Poured a black color with a tan head. Exactly as described - Imperial Stout with Neapolitan Ice Cream! Nice sipper and sharing beer. Was it sweet - yes, but it is a Neapolitan Ice Cream beer. Neapolitan ice cream sandwich goodness.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
3446,"2016-06-06",3.3,"650 mL bottle. Black body without much of a head. Smell is distinctly neapolitan, but the strawberry is just a bit artificial. Chocolate. Molasses. The strawberry treatment keeps is just the right side of bright. Taste has the strawberry flavor up front. Again, just a little artificial. Bourbon, but it isnt strong. Molasses and fudge. The base stout comes out behind it. Ridiculously sweet. Oak in the finish. Heavy. Absurd. Artificial and way too sweet. I can barely drink this.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3446,"2016-05-22",4.4,"Bottle thanks to Brian. Pours black with small tan head that lasts. The aroma is strong strawberry and vanilla cream. Thick mouth, syrupy, very sweet, strawberry and vanilla, boozy finish, really enjoyed this.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3446,"2016-05-20",4.7,"Tap. Black syrupy pour with a dark tan head. Nose is big strawberry icecream, bourbon, cocoa, a touch of vanilla. Taste is neopolitan ice cream and bourbon, just as advertised. The strawberry flavor is dominant and works better than Id have imagined. Sweet and rich without being cloying. Syrupy mouthfeel that coats the mouth.","","knickskicks"
