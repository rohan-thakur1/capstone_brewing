2040,"2016-06-13",4.0,"On draft at Tired Hands Fermentaria. The pour is a darker golden yellow, slightly hazy, with a thick white head that falls to a film, leaving solid lace. The aroma is great. There is a lot of lemongrass and lemon zest right up front. Its tart and citrusy at first, then becomes a little earthy on the back end. No real malt presence, which I like. The flavor is tart and fruity up front. Not a juicy fruit, but a dry fruit flesh and skin. The light spice picks up and a soft juiciness carries it out the back end. The mouth feel is medium bodied, with a lovely brighter carbonation and a lingeringly fruity and earthy finish. This is excellent. Im happily surprised by this.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
