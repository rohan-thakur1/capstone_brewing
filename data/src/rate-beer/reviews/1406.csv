1406,"2014-01-04",4.2,"Bottle from Schumacher Brauerei. Has a ember red, deep brown color with a perfect head, thick, which stays very long. Perfect looking Alt!

The most important thing first, the 1838er has an unusual aroma and taste for an Alt, because of the fruity hoppyness in it. Its the first Alt I have ever experienced with a very well balanced hoppy impact going along with the usual malt body, due to Cascade and Galaxy hops, Schumacher Brauerei brewed in for this anniversary beer.

Aroma of caramel, citrus, blueberries, plums and grapes, malt is present but not dominant in this beer.

The hops add a very interessting complexity, has a refreshing taste, going into a IPA direction, without forgetting of still being an Alt. Balance is great in this, a noticable bitterness kicks in after the typical bready malt beginning, which by itself has fruity undertones in it. The fruity bitterness is a very nice addition to the typical Alt-character. In the end, malt is still the most important part of the 1838er, it is present all the time, but goes along with an interessting bitterness, which creates a very smooth mouthfeel.

In addition to that, in my opinion this beer is very noticable, because its so different, compared to the usual Altbier. At this very moment, many different brewers are trying to create many new beer interpretations, not only in the USA but also in Germany. Still, this movement has not reached the very traditional Altbier-scene, and the 1838er can be seen as a first attempt to reach out for new flavors.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1406,"2013-08-15",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2015 1L fliptop fresh from the source, with a big thanks to ThirstyBird for the generous logistics! Truly an ideal sessioning Alt, presumably DE-dryhopped, but generously so, calling to mind the leafy tea aromatics of a confident ESB. Typically dry woody Alt palate countered by fruity caramalts and fresh waves of bitter and citrus zest. Supremely balanced and brewed with optimal drinkability in mind. 1L shared by 2, gone in a quick session, alas. Bonus points for catering to developing modern beer tastes while remaining genuinely regional and without having to deploy the 2.0 marketing tricks of less talented German (A/I)PA concocters. Now if only Alt could/would be copied in other German regions, as the expertise far outweighs the UK pale ale style expertise, especially concerning yeast/malt profiles... Initial Rating Date: 8/15/2013 2:06:26 PM. /// Resampled 6x1L, spring 14 housebeer. Galaxy & Citra dryhopped Ive learned, with quickly dissipating goodness, so consume fresh. Truly a composition that lifts Alts earthier caramels into a summery citrus breeze, without wanting to be an APA. Done with taste, moderation and obvious skill.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

Poured into an alt glass, ABV 5%
Clear dark amber/ deep orange copper colour on the body, with a tall off-white head, with very good retention and nice lacing left behind.
Oh, wow, what an aroma, this doesnt smell at all like your typical alt. Very hoppy aroma, lots of citrus, tropical fruits, a bit of grapefruit.
Tastes grea too, caramel malts, tropical fruits like mango, some citrus too, with a nice bitterness on the aftertaste, with a long duration.
Medium body, good biting carbonation.
Overall a really great beer, a really great alt that doesnt taste like an alt at all but more like a good IPA. Fantastic!","Arnhem, NETHERLANDS","Christos"

1406,"2013-07-14",5.0,"UPDATED: DEC 16, 2013 1,0 l bottle, bought in the brewpub. I was so excited when opening the bottle because I expected something big and in the end it turned out to be even bigger than big! The beer pours out in a clear dark amber/copper colour with steady airy head and medium body. Wonderful nose of spicy aromatic hops. Taste of fresh spicy hops, coriander, citrus fruits, grass, light barley, nuts and light whiskey. Peppery hints. This aint a Alt, it is more of a great IPA. I enjoyed it big time and want to get asap more bottles of it. A real pity that it wont be available forever.","Reutlingen, GERMANY","McTapps"

1406,"2013-06-30",4.2,"(swing top bottle, 100cl) Clear, amber to copper colour with a big and firm tanned foamy head. Fruity hoppy aroma with notes of citrus, orange blossoms and a mildly piney, resiny touch, backed by a cara-malty background. Moderately bitter and delicately sweet flavour, light to medium bodied with a well-carbonated mouthfeel. Hop-laden taste from the beginning, very aromatic with mainly notes of citrus, a floral touch and caramel underneath; the level of bitter hops is getting stronger towards the dry and still very fruity hoppy finish that lasts for a while. A great Alt from Düsseldorf with new world hops character. 27.VI.13","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
