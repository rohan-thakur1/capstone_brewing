Aroma is quite a surprise: lots of sweet sticky hay and farm notes  accompanied by very discreet toffee and caramel smells. This beer smells like it was brewed in a stable, not off-putting at first, just curious. Taste is where things go down. Thick syrupy caramel toffee flavors with something like rotten vegetables, probably the hops that have gone south. Palate is ok for the style, lots of alcohol warmth with very little to back it up. I didnt finish my 6 oz glass. I was truly dissapointed as I was expecting a lot from this beer.

Pours a deep burgundy-amber color, with light tinges of auburn, somewhat clear and with a medium-sized beige head, some retention.  Aroma of sweet toffee, sweet oranges and a touch of dry hops.  Flavor outdoes the aroma, IMHO, giving forth plentiful caramel, butterscotch, light earthiness, a bit of musty/dusty yeast and some plums/cherries.  Finishes, unfortunately, a bit too thin, with a little bit of papery astringency or perhaps spiciness.
