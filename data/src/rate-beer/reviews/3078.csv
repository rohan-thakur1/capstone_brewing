3078,"2016-08-17",3.8,"Bottle. Pours opaque black, medium creamy tan head, dissipates slowly, pretty solid lacing. Aroma is smoky, hardwood char, roast, ashy, molasses. Flavor is light sweet and medium bitter, surprisingly low in acidity. Light smokiness present but not dominant. Underlying porter comes through roasty, molasses and ashy notes. Full body, lingering bitter finish. Smokiness fades as you drink more. Perhaps could use a bit more smoke, but otherwise quite good.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

3078,"2015-08-03",4.0,"750 mL bottle, not sure if there was a 2014 and 2015 batch. I dont think so, rather this is just a 2014 bottle with some age on it. Shared by tectactoe on 7/24/15 (finished it the next day, as well).Strong tan head emerges atop a dark, ebony body that shows good clarity and deep magenta highlights on the edges. Good retention.Smoky in the nose, yes, but not Bamberg smoky. Lots more roastiness, char and even some moderate chocolate-like sweetness. Vanilla-tipped cigars, moderate fruity notes (dark cherries, concord grapes) and no alcohol or flaws noted. Not an overly intense aroma, but whats there is very well-balanced and nicely complex. Not every smoked beer can or need be a Bamberg/Schlenkerla-style beer.The flavor divulges even more than the aroma. Medium-sweet pale malts combine with the roasted malt notes and smoked malts to give a pretty classic oily/vinous, aged cigar-like character up front. But the malts keep it balanced, adding light sweetness and soft, supple body. Carbonation is medium-low but tight and engaging enough. Vanilla and cocoa notes continue through the middle, actually tipping the balance of the beer away from the smokiness. The finish ends on a more dry, ashen-like flavor. Nowhere the rich, bacon and salt one might expect from the commercial description, but rather a dry, charred, cigar-like character thats every bit as intriguing/enjoyable. Really nice stuff and well-balanced, which can be tough to achieve with this style. That it held up perfectly to be finished the next day also speaks to its quality. Thanks, Tony!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Medium+ bodied, with some liveliness to the carbonation, the taste added a touch of caramel sweetness, and presented a medium, lingering bitterness that was earthy, with a touch of charred astringency, maybe a little slickness on the tongue at first, but gradually smoothed by a bit of creaminess to the mouthfeel, so no bite.

A $10 bottle picked up by my sister from the brewery. People say this is a bomber (22oz), but its 760ml (25oz). 

Appearance: Pours a deep black color with a very small brown head on top. I generally notice porters to be ruby black, but oh well. Minimal lacing. Looks fair. (3.5/5)

Smell: Definitely smoked, without question. Almost a smoked meat sort of aroma coming off. Woody notes. Some chocolate, and a bit more coffee. As said, obviously smokey, but not overwhelmingly so. Quite nice. (4/5)

Taste/feel: Smokey, ashy, woody, roasty -- very nice taste. That smoked meat quality is also in the flavor, but its more on the nose. Theres also a slight sort of tanginess almost that suggests a meatiness further. The feel is on-point for a porter, in my opinion. This brew has a medium/high sort of carbonation, with about a medium body. Easy drinking, and not heavy. 8% is unnoticeable. Not a mindblowingly unique beer with a huge depth of flavor, but its still a joy to drink if you like some smokey beers. (4.25/5, 4.75/5)

$10 for this 750ml bottle isnt a bad price at all, but Id not pay much more for it. Its a fabulous example of a smoked porter though, and one worth trying if you can get it at a reasonable price.

The mouthfeel is rich and creamy for the style like the original porter. Really good backstage installment. I wish they sent bottles out for distribution.

3078,"2014-03-10",4.2,"On tap at Hunahpus Day 2014. Deep brown color with light tan head. Aroma is lightly smokey, dark grainy malt, some molasses-like sweetness. Taste is pleasantly smoked, not like a lot of American smoked beers. I also enjoy the roasted malt sweetness. Thick and somewhat creamy mouthfeel.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","mverity"
3078,"2014-03-08",3.7,"Draft @ The Family Dog. Dark brown/black with ample laying dark tan head. Smell is roast, old coffee, toffee. Taste is bold roasted malts,medium to light smoke, nutty, bits of burnt malt, semi sweet chocolate. Good smoked brew, but smoked is sinking into the bottom of my hierarchy of styles. Founders fanboy fo life tho!","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"
3078,"2014-03-07",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2014 Rerate. Originally 8 5 8 5 18. Only change is aroma, for carrying a beautiful smoked pork (bacon?) scent which is beautiful. 

Original. On tap at Dan's. The pour is a nice black with a decently thick darker khaki head. The aroma is chocolatey, a little coffee to it and then a gorgeous smokey character. It's like a smoked Founders Porter, but the chocolate and coffee notes are light. The flavor is a bit more smokey, and blends perfectly with the coffee and chocolate. The mouth feel is just about perfect. There is a great thickness that coats, followed up by a wonderfully dry aftertaste. This is a solid smoked beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3078,"2014-03-04",3.7,"On tap. Black pour thick mocha head. Aroma is smoke but not obnoxiously smokey. Taste is a nice mix of smoke, roasty malts chocolate and some sweetness. Wasnt expecting much. But exceeded my expectations.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
3078,"2014-03-04",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
This roasty Smoked Porter benefits from just fruitiness and slowly rising wooden smoke fumes as leafy bitterness balances everything out.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the darkness.
-Mouthfeel is quite rich.
-Alcohol is not a bother at all; residual sugars and malt complexities make sure you focus on them instead of the brews potential heat.
-This is on the verge of being in Imperial Stout territory.

On tap at The Worthy Burger.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
3078,"2014-03-03",4.0,"Draft in a taster at Ei8ht Ball. Pours a deep, mostly opaque brown with a small tan head. Smoked and roasted malts, dark chocolate, toasted sugars, earth, coffee, and some underlying sweet malts. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a smooth, lightly smoky mouthfeel. A little thin, but really nice overall.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3078,"2014-03-02",3.7,"Sampled from the bottle, 
this beer poured a dark brown and provided a two to three finger creamy, tan and brown colored bubbled head that receded after a few minutes but there was a layer on top of the glass, it left some fingers and spots of foamy lacing, the bottom of the bottle had a thin layer/film of a ring of sediment that moved around when the bottle was tipped, the sediment was pretty loose, towards the last pour of the bottle all of the sediment had disappeared, 

the aromas were roasted malt, some coffee, and a bit of chocolate in the background with faint brown sugar, 
there was wood smoke, wood fire ash, and a little oily smoke mixed in with the nose, 
it had flavors of roasted malt an smoke with some coffee and very little chocolate, 
the finish had a little bitterness (it appeared to be malt bitterness, maybe just a touch of astringency) with roasted malt and smoke trailing, 

the mouth feel was about medium, it was creamy and had average carbonation, 

this beer had a nice mix of porter beer and smoke, a good drink.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"
3078,"2014-03-01",3.6,"On tap at Pickwick and frolic- pours dark chocolate brown, fine thin tan head. Smokey hues, oak and more smoked malts, super strong. Chewy cinnamon sticks, coffee and roasted malts, almost burnt coffee beans actually, a little peaty, with a fair amount of acidity. Love porters and this is a potent smoked offering that might be a tad too much even for me. Still pretty good

3078,"2014-02-25",3.7,"Why would you only bottle this tasty brew for Michiganders? Not cool man. Was glad to see it available on draft at Leons.

3078,"2014-02-25",3.8,"Draft. Poured dark brown color with an average tan frothy head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate to heavy caramel, smoke and toasted malt aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy sweet smoked flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. Complex solid beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3078,"2014-02-24",3.7,"Taster on tap at Ei8ht Ball. Nice smokiness, roast, dark chocolate in the aroma. Very dark brown, slightly red color... Not completely opaque, clear around the edges. Thin ring of khaki head. Some short ropes of lace. Medium to bigger body, kind of chewy. Lighter, kind of crisp carbonation. Lightly slick. Moderate bitter taste, light sweet. Some earthy hop in there, hoppier than your typical porter, I think. Very tasty, solid smoked porter. Not really astounding though, Im kind of used to being wowed by the Backstage series. Its a great smoked porter but lacks a wow factor. Good bitter dark chocolate and coffee notes start to come out in the finish after this has sat for a while. Raised it a point in the end. Let this one warm up and sit, it gets pretty good. Still prefer Founders Porter, though, all around its much better rounded (from what I remember).","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
3078,"2014-02-23",3.7,"Bottle: The aroma consists of chocolate, roast, campfire, and faint coffee. It pours a dark brown with no transparency and a one finger tan head. There is some sporadic dotted lacing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with moderate chocolate and light caramel. The finish has roasted coffee, campfire smoke, and a touch of burnt notes. It?s medium bodied with moderate carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

3078,"2014-02-17",1.9,"To be fair, smoked beers are tough to perfect...heres another casualty. Expected more from a Backstage release, but it was thin, unbalanced, and obnoxious. The overwhelming imitation liquid smoke flavor overpowered the subtleties of one of the best Porters on the market. Maybe a BA version could work? In the meantime, Ill be using the rest of mine for a marinade...Mole Sauce anyone?","Hastings, Michigan, USA","jaybes"
3078,"2014-02-17",3.6,"Another wonderful porter from Founders, but a sub-par smoked. Dark black color and multi roasted and grain aromas and flavors. Smoke was barely there!","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","milewide"
3078,"2014-02-16",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 16, 2014 Tap @ Founders: Almost completely pitch black with a khaki head that hangs around a bit before turning into a chunky collar. Aroma has a very lovely, sweet smoke component that hits with both sides of the smoke spectrum - a lightly sweet, meat/bacon note comes in from the start, leading into a more campfire, ashy & woodsy smoke essence that lingers in the finish. Roasted malts & dark cocoa undertones lift the smokiness even higher. Taste is wonderful smoked wood chips, lightly sweet smoke, peat, cocoa dust, & perhaps the slightest hint of coffee grinds. Quite nutty in the aftertaste, too, but still retaining that lovely campfire smoky essence with a great balance of char & sweetness. I may be biased because I love smoked stuff, but this beer was great! I would love to see this stuff in six (or even four) packs... The smoke is executed quite elegantly, here. Bravo!","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
3078,"2014-02-16",3.7,"Shared bomber. Tall cocoa head. Opaque, dark brown. Smokey nose. Smoother palate than I would expect with a smoked beer.
