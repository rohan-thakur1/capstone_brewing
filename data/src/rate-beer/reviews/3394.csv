3394,"2016-04-18",4.0,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter
 Appearance ¬ñ The beer pours a deep mahogany color with a tiny fizzy white head. The head fades very fast, leaving just some hints of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell ¬ñ The aroma of the brew is big of a sour green apple smell mixed with a good deal of sour cherry. The sour fruity smells are accompanied by some aromas of oak and a strong apple cider vinegar and slightly hay-like aroma.
 Taste ¬ñ The taste begins with a rather sour green apple flavor mixed with a little bit of cherry. The cherry grows slightly stronger as the taste advances with a sour flavor of apple cider vinegar coming to the tongue. Along with these developing flavors comes strong flavors of hay and some yeast. A light level of cherry sweetness develops toward the middle, with it only fading again more toward the end of the taste. At the very end, a decent showing of oak and even more tart green apple and sour tastes come to the tongue, leaving one with a cherry and apple fruited sour taste to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel ¬ñ The body of the brew is rather thin with a carbonation level that is moderate. The thin body is fantastic for the sour flavors and with the medium carbonation it makes for an easier drinker in light of its very sour and bitter nature.
 Overall- A somewhat fruity, but still rather dry and quite sour brew. A pretty good example of a Flanders Oud Bruin and one to at least give a try too.","","Darkmagus82"

The flavor is equally disappointing. The malts are really sweet up front and there is a decent profile to it. There is a light vinegar and  just no sour at all.

3394,"2015-12-22",4.3,"Deep, enticingly fruity nose with Concord grapes, wood, lime juice, balsamic vinegar, cacao, earth, and calvados caramel; shift your lungs into third gear and you¬íll delve into the grainier, drier notes, with some panko crumbs. Underneath it all there¬ís a very slight funk. The mouthfeel is fizzy, with lively carbonation that dissolves the medium body into foam as you press it against your palate. I would have wished for something slightly less intrusive, as so much fizz gets in the way of such a beautiful beer. The beer is bright on the tongue, very acidic with residual sugary sweetness and a dry, grainy backbone. An extremely pleasant aftertaste of Concord grapes and Trolli gummies lingers. Outstanding, delicious, and super interesting.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

Dark reddish brown with a rather short-lived tan head. 

Aroma: Unattractive funky sour (OK) and vinegar (yuch) aroma with whiffs of over-ripe fruit and vinegar. 

T - Markedly salty and sour: in both cases, more so than any beer I can remember. The saltiness here is not to my taste. [I shared this bottle with two others who confirmed the saltiness]. Hard to get beyond these two striking components, but there is more to the flavor including hints of dark fruits, green apples, and wood. 

M - medium body with (too) light carbonation. 

O - Avoid unless you love sour beers; if, like me, you dislike vinegar, then avoid in any case.

The outstanding complex nose is light sweet red fruit - raspberries and cherries - with hints of apples and peaches, over a slightly tart and sour background. Light medium bodied with a surprisingly creamy texture given it¬ís carbonation. Well carbonated with explosive effervescence throughout. The flavor profile is simply World Class ( very intense amazingly complex and masterfully balanced ). It begins with an assault of the flavors of the nose. Tart fruits, with a slight sour note, slowly allow separation into their components (raspberry, cherry, tart apple) as the tart and sour mild puckering effect sets in. The middle is where the masterful balance and complexity become evident as every flavor just ebbs and flows like a tidal action. The finish is a slightly sweet flavor fade into a tart dry pucker that has crisp elements and hints of vinegar.

3394,"2014-05-12",3.0,"I bought this beer for $8.99 at the Breeze In, valley location, Juneau Alaska.
I poured this into a tulip.
The appearance was a nice dark brown color with some ever so slight ruby to red edges. The head was less than a half a finger with a solid clingy white lacing sticking mighty finely to the sides of the glass.
The smell was a decent sour to tart fruity aroma indicating amounts of apples and peaches with a decent woody edge to it. There is a nice earthiness coming out as well.
The taste is sour leading with the peaches and apples taking over a nice tart background. The aftertaste is soured peaches and apples to end up leading into a dry sour and tart finish.
On the palate, it sits about a medium on the body. The quality of sessionability is somewhat there as I see its a 7% beer noted on the bottle. The carbonation for this one, hmmm....well, its actually somewhat smooth and crisp.
Overall, Flanders Oud Bruin, well, this sure is according to style. I get it for the most part however, I¬ím still not sold on this style. Its nice to review because I finally understand this style but still consider it a bit over rated. To me, I most likely wouldn¬ít have this again, but if you like that mouth puckering sourness that wishes to suck your lips off of your face, I say go for this.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3394,"2014-05-12",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2014 22oz bottle, thanks to Dan for sharing. 2014 vintage. Man, this is fan-tastic! The hype is deserved, from the first sip and first smell. A lot going on in the nose. Cherry, vanilla, big oak. Light spice. Good bigger sour taste, big tannin. Medium-plus body, light nice slickness in the finish for the sour cherry vanilla oak flavor to linger on. Seeing the light earthiness; a very light spiciness. Fantastic, flavorful, and bold beer for sure. Unlike the Arctic Soiree I just tried before this, this is not a bottle I could chief all on my own, it was a great one to share 2 ways. Despite being a tad bit lighter in ABV than the arctic soiree, this beer has a much more bold flavor. The light lingering slick texture in the finish also impedes drinkability a bit. This is not supposed to be an easy-drinking smooth downable beer, though. It¬ís a potent, flavorful bold beer that is made for sharing and worth every bit of the $19. A very special, satisfying sour brown to sip on. Reminds me of Rodenbach quite a bit... Any Rodenbach fan should give this a try.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

3394,"2013-06-05",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2016 New Belgium¬ís Lips Of Faith La Folie Sour Brown Ale is really something. I had the 2012 brew, and this was my first sour ale. Wow. First off, I¬íll say that when they say sour, they don¬ít mean ""kinda sour"" or ""hints at sourness."" I did not find myself struggling to ""pick up on the sourness"" from this beer. I found myself struggling instead to pick my face up off the floor. This is a freight-train to the mouth kind of sour.

This beer pours murky brown with very little head or lace, and the aroma is a mild malt that¬ís just dominated by something like sour cherry. The flavor is aggressive. I guess that¬ís one word for it. Honestly, all I could taste was the sourness. It¬ís more of a sour apple in terms of flavor, and not the sour cherry I thought I smelled in the aroma. There is a little spice, a little background richness, but this stuff starts sour, finishes sour, and leaves a sour aftertaste. This beer is not trying to cozy up and be your friend. You¬íll like it on its terms or you won¬ít like it at all. I cannot say I really enjoyed this beer, but I can¬ít remember the last time something bowled me over like this did. I will eventually try this style again, but not soon. I¬ím overwhelmed.  My rating here is an honest first reaction.  If I develop a taste for this style I will change my rating as appropriate.  

SECOND REVIEW, OCTOBER 2016.  I sampled this beer again three years later when I toured the brewery in Asheville.  This second review is based not just on the sample I had at the brewery. I enjoyed that sample enough to bring home a bottle, and I¬íve been sipping it this evening. As it did three years ago, La Folie pours brown with very little foam. Whereas I only picked up on malt and cherry on the aroma in 2013, I notice other notes on the aroma now. The barrel aging process is conspicuous, and there are fruity notes apparent other than cherries. In fact, this year, the main secondary characteristic I notice in the smell is apples, apple cider, and brown sugar. This beer smells amazing. 

The flavor, which was simply too heavy-handed for me three years ago, seems more nuanced and multi-faceted now. That big, aggressive sourness is still there. There¬ís no getting around that, and if sourness isn¬ít something you appreciate, you probably won¬ít like this beer any more than I did when I first tired it. I guess my taste-buds have been dialed in more carefully, because along with that huge sourness I now also pick up on very strong woody and nutty notes on the flavor. There is also a crackery, dark bread quality in the background that¬ís the best part of the exhale. This beer is layered so carefully. Sour is everywhere... if this beer were music, every note would be played in the key of sour. But there are so many more instruments here than I noticed the first time around. This beer is as dense as a symphony.

La Folie is still an uncompromising beer. If you already have a taste for sours, you will probably find much here to like. If you don¬ít, this beer is just far too aggressive to pick up as your first taste of the style. Nonetheless, I¬ím glad I did find access to the style, and glad I tasted La Folie again. If I¬ím able to find it easily enough in my area, it is going to become a regular presence.","Virginia, USA","Darwenus"

Taste is too overpowering on the sour, which doesn¬ít allow any other notes to properly come through IMO. Decent mouthfeel.","","kimjongill"

This changes mid palate as a bit of an oak character leads the palate to some finishing tartness and acidity. The finish is quite acidic and mouth puckering.

Flavor starts with a big blast of sour, quite puckering, strong sour apples, cherries, vinegar, oak, a little touch of sweet malt dances around, particularly at the finish, but this sour first and foremost.  Minimal alcohol.

Mouthfeel is light/medium bodied, a bit sticky, lowish carbonation.

Very nice Sour and quite sour at that.","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"

A: Pours a black-looking but reddish brown color with a fluffy off-white head. Retention in the sniffer is decent

3394,"2012-08-25",4.5,"22 oz bottle poured into a tumbler pint glass. My first sour ale! I¬ím so excited...

A: Pours a translucent dark burgundy color with excellent clarity. The head is a two finger light mocha color featuring a moderate texture and poor head retention. Not much lacing, either. Still, the body color is so beautiful, I had to give extra points.

S: This really has a lot going on. Tart fruits (such as pear, apples, and cherries), a nicely done oak note, and so on. Like I said, there¬ís so much going on, it¬ís hard to pick out individual scents; even still, it¬ís a fantastic smell.

T: Hella tart, but it¬ís an excellent sensation that¬ís kept in check beautifully. Initial tart cherries give way to a subtle malt backbone, while the finish and aftertaste is full of accumulating oak tannins (not to mention a great lingering sourness - not overdone or too weak, just right). Very vinous, like I expected, with nuanced, pleasant vinegar notes popping up on the flavor profile every now and then. The balance between sweet and savory is pulled off with gusto, as well.

The only thing preventing me from scoring this higher (read: a 5) is simple: I¬ím not used to sour ales. Like I said, this is my first one (and I don¬ít friggen¬í care how expensive they are, this won¬ít be my last), but I reckon this would be a great introduction to the style, and it¬ís balanced fantastically enough so that most drinkers will be able to appreciate some of its subtleties without suffering too much palate overload.

M: Moderately creamy smooth, up until the midtaste, where it becomes prickly, coarse, and dry from the oak tannins and healthy carbonation. Quite mouthwatering at times. It¬ís at a weird middle ground in terms of drinkability: do I sip it slowly to appreciate all of its nuances, or do I chug it at a semi-quick pace because it¬ís so damn good? Guess I¬íll do both options intermittently, ¬ícause I¬ím hardcore...

O: As a student who¬ís pretty much on a budget, trust me when I say I¬íd still buy this again and again. I probably won¬ít in the near future, because of that fact, but it¬ís good to know such an excellent sour is so easy to find in my area. Plain and simple, this rocks.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Mouthfeel: Almost like white wine with something filling it. The weight here goes on the help carry the tartness is the flavor. 

Taste: Tart on the top with a bright white wine flavor standing out. It¬ís odd that the least prominent smell is the most prominent flavor.

3394,"2012-03-13",4.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/10/2011.  Served on tap in a snifter.

La Folie has a deep brown color with a cherry tint. As the glass wanes, a fuller cherry color is noticeable. A simmering white head is slowly reduced over time and leaves some light sticky lace.

The aroma is fairly light on any sugar of malt presence. Tart cherries, a burst of lemon, and a bit of orange all provide a tart aroma. A lot of woody oak comes through as it warms up a bit.

A dirth of true malt presence really lets the sour flavors come through right away. Lemon juice and zest come through strong, with tart cherry adding a bit of additional zing. The sour flavors grow into a climax midway through, and slowly come down as a fierce woody oak flavor steps in to close out each sip.

This is definitely on the dry side for what I have had in the sour arena. There is not much malt sweetness, although the intense sour flavor does create some salivation, giving an illusory mouthfeel presence of a sweeter beer. The carbonation is fairly standard, with small bubbles neither being too crisp nor creamy. For how sour it is, it is not that acidic and even less vinegary. 

Overall: This was the first sour I had a long time ago, and it threw me off. Now I would say it is a great addition and one of my sour standbys.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Pours a murky, dark brown-red colored body with an inch thick, lively, dirty beige head that dissipates slowly and leaves a veil of beautiful lacing throughout. Gorgeous beer. Aroma is funky and tart with some barnyard, sweet cherries, and wood. Slightly acidic and a light caramel, smooth malt shows up behind the sourness. Pretty awesome aroma and the flavor is no different. Tart and funky up front with a great sourness. The mellowness of the brown malt gives off just a touch of caramel and really keeps everything balanced and exceptionally easy drinking. Some sweet cherries, acidity, and a good amount of wood before the cherries grow in tartness and the sourness picks up in the finish, but it ends so clean and balanced while drying with just the slightest bitterness and a really nice woodiness. The aftertaste doesn¬ít linger forever, but has a very pleasant sweet cherry sourness and acidity. Very smooth, clean, light body with a slightly lively, very soft carbonation. Overall, an extremely impressive sour. Everything works exceptionally well together and it¬ís hard to think that this beer would ever be drinking better than it is now.

The smell was tart, sour cherry and apples with an obvious oak back note.

The taste was a delicious malty cherry and apple combination. A touch of the oak but the tartness tends to overwhelm the pallet. This to me is not a bad thing. The flavor profile is tart and a bit puckering, but it also has a complexness to it with the tree fruits and the malt and the oak.

3.5 A: Nearly clear dark amber brown color. One and a half fingers of frothy light brown head with poor retention and no lacing. Not very pretty, but given the style, it¬ís okay.

4.5 T: Puckering sourness from the top with tart cherries and plums. Again there is a good bit of acetic acid. Plenty of brett funk as well. Oak woodiness with a soft caramel sweetness.

While I do feel that it is New Belgium¬ís best beer, and a sour that you should seek out if you can¬ít get anything else (e.g. Rodenbach or Duchesse), it still contains the tell-tale characteristics of the New Belgium fermentation characteristics that I liken to fresh lawn bags--the big black plastic ones that you put leaves into. I respect this beer, but only to a point. Aside from the aforementioned ""off"" aroma and flavor profiles, the beer is well structured and balanced on the palate.

(Let me preface this by saying I am new to sour beers and this is the first Flanders Red I have bought. Still, I have high expectations for this one.)

Darker than I expected: a dark bing cherry crimson with a nice-looking two finger, lightly pink head. Head recedes, but it takes a few minutes to get down to a comfortable half finger skin atop the beer. 

Tart cherries. Sweet vinegar. Other fruits I can¬ít quite put my nose on ... Granny Smith apples? Woo - puckeringly sour at first, but I just let it sit in my mouth and coat the tongue and my mouth seems to acclimate. Somewhat metallic mid-palate, but that could just be the astringency of the oak. Definite cherry. The sourness is great without being overwhelming. Hard to pick out particular flavors, but this is solid. 

Smooth and balanced. The tartness lingers, but this one finishes dryly. Feels great.

Sip, puck, sip. I would say this is surprisingly drinkable, as I find myself wanting to go back to it for another sip 30s after my last one, and that¬ís saying something for this type of beer. But I suppose only time will tell as I make my way through the bottle. Excellent beer overall by NB.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

Flavor is mouth puckering sour raspberry, blackberry, sour cherry.  There are some notes of vinegar which personally I do not like - it is not dominating but present enough to detract from the beer.  Pretty good, but doesn¬ít stand up to the russian river sours I¬íve had.  Those, although very sour, do not have this vinegar aspect.","Denver, Colorado, USA","tennessejed420"

A-pours a clear burgundy red color with a slightly off white colored head.

S-the nose has notes of oak with hints of vanilla underneath.  lots of acidity and acetic acid, tart cherries, wow this burns the nostrils not in a good way.  the vinegar and acidity in this beer is huge.

T-the flavor isn¬ít bad but I can¬ít finish this beer.  more sweetness than the nose, sweet red cherries, light oak presence, tons of acidity and vinegar.  this heats the entire body and makes me sweat all over.  rest goes in the drain...

M-smooth feel to it, somewhat creamy in the mouth with a medium body.  tons of carbonation, prickly and rough to swallow, very dry and still can¬ít get over the heat.

D-the flavor isn¬ít offensive but this is the most acidic beer I have ever had, it burns my body and I literally sweat every sip I took.  By far the most acidic and most acetic beer of the group.

¬í08
A-very dark burgundy, almost brown and much more dark than the 05.  the edges are red with a slightly off white colored head.

S-the nose is seemingly well balanced, tart ripe cherries, moderate oak presence, hints of leather, acidity takes over with more sour cherries.

T-well balanced acidity on this, nice cherry tartness up front with a good fruity sweetness to it.  hints of leather, the acidity is strong in the back with just a touch of vinegar.

M-smoother and softer especially in the finish with a medium body and crisp dry finish.

D-considerably better than the 05 and best of the three.  this has a decent balance of acidity to flavor with a nice ripe tart cherry presence.  not overly complex but still a decent beer.

¬í10
A-this pours the darkest of the three, chestnut brown in color with an off white head.

S-the malt presence from the base beer is present in this, sweet cherries with a very light tartness to it.  there is some acetic acid in the back but not strong.

T-follows the nose, base beer still present, malt body, good amount of sweet cherries and very light tartness.  least complex of the group but still drinkable.

M-this is the least acidic beer of the group and probably the softest palate of the bunch.  slightly dry finish, not as dry as the 08, medium bodied and a little syrupy.

D-this seems to be the easiest drink of the bunch, least complex and least amount of acidity.  the sweetness is present and the sour is quite low.  the oak presence is very light in this one.

Overall thoughts-the 05 was brutal, flavors weren¬ít off but the acidity ramped up so much no one could drink it, the 10 was the easiest drink but also the least ""sour"" of the group and really lacked the sourness or acidity you would have liked to see.  the 08 was the best balanced, base beer pretty much gone but enough oak presence and acidity to create a decent brew.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"

Pours deep reddish brown with an opaque orange hue. There is a slight off white head that quickly dissipated into itself. The nose is lactic acid, French oak, cherries, vanilla, dried apple, vinegar, and some wild yeast. The taste is tart cherries and apples at first that transition into a dry white grape like middle that finishes with a creamy oak and vanilla palate. The cherry/apple/grape taste truly lingers throughout the drink. I really enjoyed the oak flavor and the amount of dry and bitter wood. The legs are sticky and the mouthfeel is very creamy.

The flavor is just as sour as the nose elts on with the sour cherries and apples taking center stage but is smoother out by the lactic cream and caramel malt. The oaky vanilla ties everything together nicely along with adding depth. Medium bodied with champagne like carbonation, but still maintains an easy drinking quality.

3394,"2010-06-03",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2011 I have really been in the mood for a sour beer lately and this surely hit the mark!
La Folie wood aged beer in French Oak barrels.
Pours a deep ruby red/brown with a slight tan head.
Smells of sour apples with the tinge of tartness
The taste is...you guessed it...all sour. Apples, fruit, acidic, and earthy. 
Light in the mouth.
Very drinkable...if you are into sours. This one is sour front and center. 
A very good beer.
Have an older version that I will rate as soon as I decide to crack it open!
Re-Rate: After delving into the world of sours, I have to take this one down a bit as it is not as good as others I have sampled. Had on draft last night and although still a solid and affordable sour, it just doesn¬ít have the bite some others have.

22oz bomber purchased at liquidsolutions....

Appearance: 4.0 Lovely dark brown with red corners. 1 finger beige crown that rapidly dissipates and leaves a bit of lace.

Smell: 4.5 Sweet and sour goodness! So far this smells like a classic Flanders Red and I¬ím really excited to taste it! Vinegar notes, sour cherry notes, dark malts, etc. Complex for the style.

Taste: 4.5 Lots going on but it all adds up to sweet tart like goodness. Lots of sour cherry and almost a lemon like puckering flavor throughout. Gets better as it warms a bit. Good amount of complexity.

Mouthfeel: 3.5 A touch too thin IMHO.

Drinkability: 4.0 Flanders Red¬ís aren¬ít the most approachable to begin with but this brew remains fairly drinkable despite it being complex.

The cherries add to the acidity but this one is all about dryness and tartness. This is good but I¬ím still hoping my 2008 750ml bottle drinks better than this 2009 bomber.

2008 750ml Bottle consumed on 2/20/10

Appearance: 4.0 Lovely dark brown with red corners. 1 finger beige crown that rapidly dissipates and leaves a bit of lace.

Smell: 4.5 A touch drier than the 2009 bomber with more tartness and further pronounced brett. Sour cherry notes are still present but not as much malt as the 2009 bomber. Hints of toasted barrel and leather.

Taste: 4.5 Again the lemony brett notes and dryness are more pronounced than the 2009 bobmer. Lots of sour cherry still and a hint of barrel. Moderate pucker and the finish is fairly short.

Mouthfeel: 4.0 Is definitely superior to the 2009 sampling. A bit more heft to it with ample carbonation.

Drinkability: 4.0 Goes down fairly smooth but has a good amount of sharpness.

T- The flavor is much like the smell. It starts off with a big acidic tartness which puckers the lips without going over the top. In the background are much more subtle characters of cherry,wood, and must as well as a hint of vinegar. The acidic sourness fades a bit for the finish and allows these other characters to emerge a little bit.

On draught, this beer pours a dark amber with a two finger sized white head. Aroma is really fantastic. Sour, lambic characteristics with that cherry, yeasty, floral grapey like flavors.

Pleasantly sour flavor is strongly of sour apple and quite fierce - those who love sour ales should flip over this one! Texture is fairly smooth and nicely tingly.

Adding my observations for the 2012 version: Strong aroma is mainly sour apple, not for the faint of heart! It pours a deep, clear mahogany with a rather thick and persistent pale tan head. Flavor is fiercely tart, with apple dominating but letting through hints of malt and hop bitterness. Texture has average body and plenty of tingle. Why is the 2012 considered an alias? IMHO it should be listed as a separate brew, but in the end it¬ís Rate Beer¬ís call.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"

Nose is tart and fruity w/ lots of complex spice nose--absolutely the best quality this beer has. Taste is tart but conservatively so for something that says ""seriously sour"" on the label. The overall effect is quite like some of the tarter pure fruit juices, cranberry or cherry, only w/ added depth and complexity from some tannic overtones. My only gripe is mouthfeel which I felt lacked the necessary effervescence to make this a truly lively experience. Overall, a wonderfully complex beer though.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

The tart apple notes fill the nose upon the first few sips... after warming a bit the French Oak barrels come through and create a wonderful blend of sour and wood aromas... There is a generous level of sourness throughout the mouth which is predominantly sour apple notes, lemon and a touch of barnyard... La Folie delivers the perfect amount of sourness from start to finish... it starts off light across the nose and builds throughout the mouth into a lip puckering, eyebrow raising blast of sour on the finish.

The taste was sour from the first sip, with cidery, green apple flavor dominating all.  In fact had I been subjected to a blind taste, I might have been fooled into thinking I actually was drinking fermented cider.  A woody dryness followed the sourness imparting some vanilla finish.  The alcohol was a non-factor in the taste.  The body was medium thick and nondescript, but the lightness added to the refreshing and quenching appeal.

3394,"2009-11-08",3.5,"22oz bomber. Pours a deep amber brown with a medium-sized short-lived head. The aroma has some toffee malt sweetness, some funky fruitiness (rhubarb, sour cherry), and a strong dose of sourness with an acetic bite. The flavor is such a mesmerizing dichotomy: acidic through and through with some funky and earthy sourness, but also quite malty with notes of chocolate malts and other dark malts. Unfortunately, the sourness begins to take over after several sips, which makes the beer a little more one-dimensional, unfortunately softening/hiding the beautiful nuanced maltiness. The finish is sour and earthy with strengthening notes of vinegar, but also some sour fruit characteristics. There are pleasant notes of dark malts and toast in the finish, too - just barely fighting their way through the sour. The mouthfeel is acidic and crisp, like a tart sparkling cider - but with a little more vinegar-acetic quality. Overall, a very pleasant sour ale. The sourness is quite intense at times, but the beautiful malt character layered underneath saves it from being too sour or unpalatable. Funky and interesting for sure.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Medium bodied and the sourness attacks the taste buds, it¬ís a full on assault, very zesty feeling. Sips wonderfully and makes the mouth water wishing for more.

Aroma is pleasantly of sour fruit and malt, yeast, etc.  Flavor is solidly sour, very pleasant and smooth.  Lots of green apple, very dry crisp body, lots of good vinegar undertones, and some slightly milder sharp cheddar flavor, as previously noted by other raters.  Really a delicious sour.  Overpriced, in my opinion, but a very worthy ale nonetheless.","San Diego, California, USA","gorditoabd"

Pours a red-brown color with a very small off-white head that quickly dissipates.Aroma is very tangy with a tart sourness, cheesy notes and a slightly sweet overall profile. Flavor is in your face sour, very tart and leaves your mouth dry. Cheesy, barnyard note with a sour Granny Smith apple ""sweetness"" and slightly acidic at the end. Density of the brew is awesome and holds the flavors very well with a very highly carbonation rate which makes the flavors ""pop"" in your mouth and seemingly emphasizes the sour/tartness of the beer perfectly.

3394,"2009-08-12",1.5,"1 pt. 6 oz. bottle served in tumbler- a sour brown ale?  Really?  Well let¬ís crack this puppy open- poured a non transparent very dark brown with heavy tints of black- when held to a light source.  Medium carbonation, no head.  Aroma of more funk than James Brown and Stevie Wonder in their respective heydays combined, white vinegar, soft green apples, hardened cherries, and-malt.  Hits the mouth with a high-medium body, malt is there but HARD sourness makes it very easy to mistake it, middle is ho-hum, finish is a vinegar/sour bomb. Frankly (why do I feel like Gordon Ramsey?)- this is crap.  Absolute crap.  For the cash I spent on this, I could have bought a case of macrobrew, added some white vinegar, and I would have recieved the same effect-and would have a much better time!!!

3394,"2009-08-11",4.3,"This one has been eluding me for a while.  Since I began trading, for some reason it fell into the category of never important enough to seek out specifically, but too important to ever be a throw in for a trade.  Finally tonight, i get to try this one, and expectations are high.  The scent meets those expectations with a blast of sour cherry and tarty goodness.  A hint of apples there as well.  Appearance doesn¬ít fare quite as well as in spite of my attempts to create some, there is not much in the way of head retention.  Otherewise a very dark red liquid, looks like a glass of wine.  Taste is very good.  I have had quite a few in the flanders category and what is great is how different they can be.  This one first hits with the wood, then the sour love.  A sour lover¬ís sour, but I wouldn¬ít recommend breaking in a sour novice on this one.  Just an excellent beer.

The taste has a moderately intense sourness that hits the sides of the palate, giving way to flavors of bready, slightly sweet malts and oak barrel.

The spritzy head reduces to a thing ring of lace and a partial canopy. Aromas are like red Rhone wines with it¬ís acidic, earthy tones yet also hits you in the face with a stinging sourness. Light to medium nectar w/ expansive residual effers on the palate. The texture is a little unrefined and gritty rather than soft and pillowy. My first impression is..let me take another sip, and another. Fnally I am ready to take this one head on. An earthy specimen w/ nuances of musty olive meat and aged leather. Extremely soured w/ a pungent acidity that could desolve that fat off the most decadent of meals. Bracingly dry, not a drop of sweetness. Minute describables like sulpher, lime, sodium, cured meat, wood, underripened grapes, cherries, and after you pour in the lees a defined Herdez Jelapano essence appears. Tastes like a cave. The finish is sour yet shortlived and bittered from the acid spectrum. Overall: this brew is very complex. It just seems to be lacking a bit in certan areas as you will see in my component breakdown.

3394,"2009-07-09",4.3,"Original review date 3/1/2009...

750, corked and caged...hand-bottled 10/2008...#9945. Took it from the fridge for about 20-30 minutes to warm a bit. Into the Ommegang chalice it goes with a solidly strong pop of the cork...letting it breathe for about 10-15 minutes after opening...

Pours a murky dark sofa-leather (distressed leather) brown...a little hazy and cloudy topped by almost a finger of tight buttery ginger-maple head. Leaves moderately quickly but leaves strong bready wisps of yeast up top.

Beautiful leathery (power of suggestion) horse blanket and saddle notes (now I get what the wine community means by saddle notes - it only took 7 years and a very special beer to figure it out). Mild clove and ginger spice cut the thick sour funk...a little cinnamon, dates and stewed prunes. The oak character is mildly husky and reduces the poignancy of it all...acting as a moderator or liaison...or maybe a mediator...to bring this all together.

I enjoy the hell outta this at virtually room temperature...Leathery body with slight vinegary sour warmth envelops and warms the soul. Mild ginger/clove spice blends like a Christmas fruit cake (I mean a good one) for an even backbone. The oakiness of it all provides an even keel and really mellows this and calms it down incredibly well.

Powerful yet soothing sourness meld with dark fruits to create Beautiful Chemistry. On the palate presence the oak is key in providing a creamy vanilla feel while working with the carbonation to put it all together. Even-keeled for the style and the most creamy and soothing example I¬íve come across.

Under normal circumstances a 750 in the style would be a daunting task in and of itself to enjoy in one setting. But, this is not normal - a tremendous effort that yes, drinks rather slowly but warms the body with every sip and is consistent from start to finish - only enhancing itself slowly with warmth. Very even quality and superb construction.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

Bomber from Bearden Beer Market. I am still blown away by this brew. This is every bit as good as any classic European example of the style I have tried. The sourness is clean and cuts like a knife and dominates the palate. Underneath the tasty vinaigrette complexity is a tasty backdrop of fruits, oak, and perhaps something like anise. This is such a full bodied sour and so well balanced. I can¬ít sing the praises enough of this.

Poured in a pint glass which I though was a bit weird since it was sour ale but hey it was a local spot that actually carried this, so I was hyped. Color was light shade of brown and not that easily visible through accompanied by a small fizzy short lived head. My nose detected a strange combination of spiced yeast and sweetened malts that genuinely smelt appetizing. The flavor was over bearing with sourness which sent my taste buds into shock and intensified the drink even further which was what I was completely expecting. Slight similarities to a medium red wine recent in vintage years but also beer like and more up my alley in the category of wood barrels and alcohol. In summary, I enjoyed this offering from New Belgium and only wish I could of furthered my experience with this drink by possession of a bottle instead of a pour in an improper glass in a rowdy and loud pizza bar.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

Very pungent and aggressive.  I like! (Aroma up from 8 to 9).  The flavor is great with an awesome barnyard funky finish that is truly outstanding, However, there is a weird momentary wateryness that shines through in both the flavor and the palate almost as if this were gravity brewed to at a higher abv and diluted down.  Still outstanding though. The waternyness is beginning to subside the more I drink.  Very spicy with acidity with a dry long finish. (flavor staying at 8).  Meidum to full body with minimal carbonation, but enough fine bubbles to tickle the tongue.  (palate up from 4 to 5, and Overall up from 17 to 18).

Aroma has tart cherries, grapefruit, a bit of dusty funk and lots of acidity - theres a bit of straight vinegar in there. What Im not used to is the sweet malt undertone. Im so used to sours being countered with sweet fruit (raspberry, etc) - while this one has fruit in it, the balance comes from malts. The oak comes through in the flavor - nice touch. Makes you pucker, but totally in-bounds, and I think my favorite part was in the aftertaste - theres just a bit of toasted hazelnut that shows up several seconds after the other notes fade. Very good - an entirely successful interpretation.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

Taste, this is sour all over, if not a fan of the style you might want to overllook and really get into the complexity of the beer itself.
Taste starts off with some sweetness and is followed by a wave of sourness.
The oak gives the beer a light apple/cider note, but overtaken by some tart cherry.

Nice, sticky, honeycomb lacing marks the glass.  The nose is nothing short of divine, with layer upon layer of succulently sour fruits, primarily cherries and apples, with notes of balsamic vinegar, toasted French oak, and lactic creaminess.  There is a light, earthy, mustiness to the yeast profile.  Flavors are equally impressive.  Tart, nay, sour cherries and apples are calmed by lactose and caramelized sugars.  Oak is the glue that binds everything together, its toasty, musty, vanilla profile drawing the sour fruits and lightly sweet malts into a beautifully integrated, satisfying sipping beer.  Effervescent yet silky, the palate achieves perfect balance between substance and drinkability.  This is just an excellent beer from start to finish.  Masterful.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Ughsmash, thanks buddy! 
 Appearance & Nose
Poured into a snifter with red-hazy-amber color and medium frothy offwhite head.  Great head retention and lacing of the glass. Nose from the pop of the cork is vibrant, pungent, aggressively tart cherry. Screams sour and purkiness to come.  Apples, white vinegar, wood, red wine are also apparent. 
Flavor & Palate
Mouth feel of micro bubbles and  light body. Initial taste tart. Freshly sliced granny apple & sour cherries combine with intense sour presentation. White vinegar falls into place from the aroma and displays mildly the acetic acid . Mid palate displays more oak and some mild barnyard funk (must and hay). Finishing dry with raspberry and lemon rhine bitterness. Palate duration is above average. Planning to drink this entire bottle to the face but this one is definitely a sipper, strong acidity really catches up after first half glass. Sides of the mouth pucker with joy. Not overwhelmingly complex but a flavor that displays fine qualities of a sour ale and is very drinkable as well as enjoyable. You want sour, this is remarkeable along with intense heartburn I am receiving.","Norwood, Massachusetts, USA","Alldaydrinker"
3394,"2008-03-31",4.1,"Deep red pour with soft tan head. Nose is very tart (which I love) cherries, apples and vinegar. Wood comes out as well. Flavor is a surprisingly tasty sour that gives good mouth coverage. Very nice.","Houston, Texas, USA","Zinister"
3394,"2008-03-28",4.4,"Bottled 2007. This poured a gorgeous red brown with a towering whitish head. Tons of bubbles. The head gently subsided though leaving a thin layer that stuck around through most of the glass. Aroma of green apples, cherries, brett and wood. The flavor of this was just fantastic: sour, tart, smooth oakiness. It just wrapped itself around your mouth: bubbly, and dry enough not to be cloying at all. Glad for the advice to drink this fresh!","San Francisco, California, USA","cmillward"
3394,"2008-03-25",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2008 This 2007 bottle from session1979.  Thanks!
Pours a cranberry to blood red color with a light beige medium lived head.  Smell is nice and tart, with a semi sweet and woodsy cherry aroma and a smooth rounded character.  Surprisingly devoid of a harsh vinegary aroma, which was very welcomed.  Taste was intensely tart, and extremely drying oakiness, and dry unsweetened sour cherries.  Nice and tart and unbalanced in a fantastic way.  Sucks the moisture out of your mouth like a really dry tanniny wine.  No harsh vinegary qualities to it in the flavor either, making for an awesomely drinkable sour.  My new favorite of the style!","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

A great looking flemish sour brown.  Very tart and acetic aroma with some fruits, vinegar, some woodys elements.  Flavor profile has a very pronounced sour cherry presence that melds nicely with an oak smoothness in the finish.  Very very quality brew.

3394,"2008-03-10",4.4,"Following the pop of the champagne cork a mist of condensation rises out of the bottle.  This gives the effect that I¬ím about to embark on a trip with a magic elixir.  The head puffs up huge: 2-3 inches of a brownish creme.  This falls off to a thin 2 millimeter head after about five minutes.  After the pour the head is made up of micro and macro foam with big bubbles popping on the surface causing a mashed potatoes effect.  The beer itself is a amberish brown.  It is dark enough to not allow any light to pass through even when held up to a light.  This is what a beer should look like.  It¬ís killing me that I have to write this first before tearing into this absolutely gorgeous brew.

The aroma is a fantastic tangy sweet breath of refreshment.  It smells extremely flavorful while staying light.  Behind the tangy sweetness I¬ím catching a touch of walnut shell.  Nutty almost.

The first sip is sharp and lightly cutting.  But in a fantastic way.  This is a very sour beer.  It is very similar to kombucha tea.  Or like the vinegar chugalug that grandparents in Pennsylvania drink for their health (with the exception that this beer is delicious).  The taste is sharp enough to almost give the back of my throat a cold-headache-like feeling.  The sour and sharpness is nicely balanced out with a sweetness that is not completely unlike fruit.  Breathing out through the mouth after a swallow brings on the barest hint of smoke.  Similar to peat burning in scotch production.  The breath out also brings on a touch of bark in a moist forest.

The palate is very thin.  The thinness adds to the refreshing effect of this beer.  Like lemonade on a summer day.  You can feel the tiny bubbles of the carbonation almost as a bite on the tongue and back of the throat.

Overall this is a great beer.  One of my favorites.  It takes beer down such a rarely traveled path and does it with style.  It is hand bottled out of one of the first bottling set-ups that new belgium ever owned (only six bottles at a time).  This is just one of the signs of the love and time that went into this beer.","USA","quantumtigger"

The aroma was tart and magnificent with an acidic presence which was fruity and nicely contained a bacterial presence.  The aroma had some semblance of Brett but also other buggy infestations and a tannic characteristic of oak and perhaps wine. The beer poured into the glass crystal clear amber/copper with a beige slow growing, yet moderate and everlasting head which lasted forever to lace the glass. The flavor was tart with a  fruity characteristic. The flavor was oaky and sweaty and had a horsey nature that was very sublimely achieved.  The tartness was light and refreshing and did not detract. The finish was dry with light tartness and fruit lasting into the aftertaste. The body was medium and the beer was highly carbonated and spritzy on the palate. A really nice Oud Bruin, excellent aroma and great flavor. Many thanks to the guys from CARBOY for bringing this one back to me.

3394,"2007-12-25",2.3,"long before the printing press or dental floss came to old europe, before casual pillaging fell out of favor, brewing was in it¬ís infancy. along the marshy, fetid rivers of the low country, tribal people were able to collect steeped barley juices and contain them in hand hewn wooden vessels. then, by forces unknown to them, a fortuitous alchemy occurred: it would ferment, becoming not merely drinkable, but mood-alteringly alcoholic. cheers! well enough so far, and the neo-lithic timeline of beer was launched in the trial and error evolution that all arts and sciences undergo. along the way it was inevitable that casks of beer would upon occasion become breached and both emit and absorb elements of their respective environments. sometimes the cask would float away in a flood and wash up months later in a putrid bog where flies would bite and dead carp would bloat in the viscous muck.  the lost, supurating cask, once rediscovered and pried out of the sulphurous clay and brought back home, would frantically have it¬ís bung cleaned and removed, unleashing the pickled beer so cherished in those hard times of subsistence living. pulling lice from their beards while smiting the skulls of their rivals, the haggard elders would hoist a kiln-baked ox bladder chalice and joyously decant some of the precious beverage. being innured to the quotidian eating of slugs and dirt-encrusted flotsam of the sort that would disgust a starving jackal, they shuddered only momentarily to observe that the liquid was the color of wind-dried mackerel, a mummified flesh kind of ruddy yellow, translucent and foaming with disease. those that bothered to sniff were assaulted with odors of rose hip vinegar and the pine-sap based solvents used to waterproof ocean kayaks. the dried apricots used to sweeten the brew had been preyed upon by malignant bacterial barbarities, striping away sweetness and leaving a lemon juice sourness that is to the tastebuds what a bulldozer is to a tulip bed. there is sour cherry and crab apples, grasshopper excreta, composting cucumbers, and corn husks. in addition we discern a suggestion of  foie gras livers --not the forced-fed foie gras of geese-- but the bloated livers of lifelong alcoholics. and now, from this page of zymurological history, a beer that evolved in a ripe humidor of conjoining accident and design-- drenched in sweat, error and ocassional food poisoning, comes this: new belgium¬ís la folie! i honored it¬ís reputation, recoiled momentarily at it¬ís price, and resigned myself to settle into whatever spell it¬ís gustatory poetry might beguile me with. when my skull twisted back with the aroma in a way that would behead a bobble-head doll, i knew i was out of my element. the astringency of this put me into a full arrest of acid reflux syndrome that a half pack of tums could scarsely contain: the tablets bubbled in my digestive cauldron as fecklessly as turning a kitchen fire extinguisher upon a volcano. there was a remote brown sugar sweetness crying out from the overburden of puckering sourness, but it was like a spritz of air-freshener in a hog farm.  the heart and soul of the beer is in it¬ís unrepentant green olive sour bitterness, like ketchup vinegar-- a lethal tartness that would cause seizures in dung beetles. every sip becomes a bruising bite upon the tongue-- i could have worn out three tongues and still come away beaten, exhausted, and heartbroken.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"
3394,"2007-12-24",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2010 2005 bottle tasted Christmas Eve 2007.
The beer starts beautifully. A soft pop of the cork, a gorgeous pour (clear deep beautiful copper read with a nice white head). Simply lovely aroma: wood, balsamic vinegar, sour cherry. 

But for whatever reason, the flavor doesn¬ít blow me away the way that the best lambics do. Rather, the flavor is just a little bit over the top sour for my taste (Despite the fact that I adore e.g. Cantillon Bruocsella 1900 Grand Cru) or perhaps it is that the intense sourness is not matched with a corresponding dryness. The acidity burns the throat almost like whisky; it scorches the inside of my nose like vinegar; it kicks away at the inside of my stomach like too much black coffee at 4 in the morning. The woody tones in the flavor are wonderful, but my palate doesn¬ít ""shift"" as I sip into this one as it does for my favorite lambics. (By this I refer to that glorious saturation of one¬ís sour receptors that kicks in a third of a way through a great bottle such that the subtle sweetness comes through and shines like miracleberry on the tongue.) A day later, I still struggle to finish this one, even with help from my father, who did more than half of the work. Sadly, I¬ím in little hurry to repeat the experience and in less hurry yet to repeat it on a full bottle. 7/5/7/3/13=3.5

Tap 7/25/09. Perfectly reasonable sour, but I just don¬ít understand the hype.  A schooner of this one was more than enough.

Bottle 8/05/09. As part of the Naked City sour tasting, this one shined, easily outclassing the competing flight of Duchess, Rodenbach GC, and Cascade Cuvee de Jongleur. Deep sourness, very clean, certainly deserving a 4.0 if Rodenbach Grand Cru deserves a 3.9. 
I¬íll bump in that general direction.

Tap 2/4/10. I¬íd forgotten what a rich dark brown this pours. Again, richly enjoyable. Very nice woody flavors. 3.8 or 3.9 range.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

3394,"2007-12-17",3.6,"11/7/07 From the bottle.  Aroma is fruity and tart, efevescent, with a sweet malt background and lightly alcoholic note.  Appearance is a medium hazy copper with a moderate tan head.  Flavor has a strong lactic acid tang that becomes much stronger in the finish, sweet, with a low resiny flavor.  Mouthfeel is highly attenuated, dry, tingly and warm.  Overall, this is marred by the back of the throat tingling/finish just being too strong and overpowering the rest of the flavor.  Perhaps an extra 20 minutes to open up and oxidize on the next try will help the flavor.","Renton, Washington, USA","Bradrcr"

May 08 bottle:
Aroma is sour, red fruit, lactic.  Fruity and fizzy.  Lots of cherry and dull fruit in the nose (probably cereal malt) that is still somehow vibrant.  
Taste is very oaky, red fruit, malty and some cereal.  Very tart. 
Finish is slick and a bit buttery, but a lot of tartness, some abrasive sourness, and finally some crispness.

3394,"2007-07-20",4.6,"Bottle 07-3215.  Unfortunately my state¬ís antiquated laws on alcohol means I don¬ít always get to try some of the better beers.  But luckily I was able to get a hold of this.  I mainly got it because I¬íd never had a barrel aged beer but had always wanted to try one.  Then I realized it was a Oud Bruin style.  I¬íve always been a big fan of lambics, in particular geueze.  So I was pleasantly surprised with this beer.  I can see that the tartness might be a bit much for some.  But I really enjoy the tartness.  One of my favorite wines is a tart raspy white wine called vihno verde.  Very complex in taste, a nice sweetness mixed in with the very strong tartness, with an interesting woody finish.","Fayetteville, Arkansas, USA","Mith242"
3394,"2007-07-17",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 18, 2007 Bottle CS 2532 from my first trade with Kevin. Thanks! Pours a beautiful garnet red with a thin dissipating off beige head. Aroma is quite nice- sourness, apple, cherries, oak. Ultra fine and lively carbonation. Medium bodied with a dry texture. Initial flavor is sweet with notes of cherry, vanilla, and plum. You immediately get whacked with a huge mouth puckering tartness, followed by dry oak. This has just the right amount of sweetness. The oak carries through to an somewhat overly acidic finish, creating a dry and peppery bite that lingers. The beer was very well done, but way too acidic and tart for my personal tastes. I am going to struggle finishing  this 750, as this is too much beer for one person to drink.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"
3394,"2007-07-16",4.3,"Poured a garnet red when held up to the light. Large, but soft, foamy head resting on top that quickly dissolved to a spotted film. Nose is very sour and I love sour. I can¬ít quite place what the baseness of the sourness is without a taste but I know I like it.

Flavor is a wallop full of sourness. Just a bucket full of sour cherries. I love ripe cherries but never really liked cherry flavored food stuffs but I am really digging this beer. Getting some tannins from wood too. Mouthfeel is full and vinuous. Puckeringly sour. The sourness actually creates a bit of deception and makes this beer feel lighter than it realy is. I would suggest serving it cold and drinking slowly to allow additonal cherry flavors come out as the beer warms.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","muddyfeet"

3394,"2007-07-09",3.8,"Pretty intense here and while I can appreciate a good Flemish Sour, this was a touch too acidic for me.  I prefer to see the acidity as an accent piece to the tapestry of flavours that are usually present in these styles.  I did like the barrel-aging component as well as fruit complexity which adds another dimension.  Malt flavours and acidity are out of whack, but peering through the layers there was a nice job and alot of thought put into creating a complimentary malt backbone.  Good design and attempt, but the final execution was off with the acidity.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"

3394,"2007-06-21",4.5,"I¬íve had a couple bottle of this, and I¬íve also enjoyed on tap, but this is the first time I¬íve sat down to review it.

Pours a mahogany with a two finger off-white head that fades rather quickly to a spotty cap and ring. The subsequent lacing is sticky, leaving behind a nice webbing of foam behind.

Smell; sour cherries dominate the aroma upfront, along with vinegar and oak. There¬ís a little vanilla and pepper, along with a mild underlying sweetness. This has one of the more complex noses of any beer that I¬íve ever had.

Taste; the oak comes out a little more forcefully in the flavor, and then settles into the sour cherries with some tart apples. The vanilla doesn¬ít come out right away, but starts to peek though as this warms, as does a little bit of the pepper I noticed in the smell. This actually makes my mouth water from the sourness after a little while.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a nice crisp carbonation. I actually enjoy beers like this on a warm day, which is good as it¬ís about 90 degrees out side, and this is going down very nicely..","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

4/25/2009:  La Folie has a very sour aroma but becomes sweeter and more of a caramel malt presence after it breathes a little.  The flavor is tart and contains lots of cherry.  It is sour, but seems to stike a good balance with the malt.  The finish is dry.  Good, if not better than I remember it from 2 years ago!

3394,"2007-05-19",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2012 Original rating. 750mL Bottle. Rising, acerbic, volatile aroma, loaded with strawberry reduction, balsamic must, barrel finings, oak chemicals, edges of glacial acitic acid, pear sauce, tabasco and rum. Complex, refined, enticing and amazing. Pours a nice clearish ruddied middle brown, beautiful foam of smoked ivory atop. Flavor falls behind a little bit, but works gracefull with the tart and acidic. More pale fruit sauces, spiked with drops of vinegar and sake. Crisp, clean and actually really soft. The carbonation is perfusive and cuts the edges off. Really not as searing and blinding as I expected. Even better than I had envisioned. Finishes dry, with a bit of almond sweetness and some mistings of lemon rind. Beautiful. 9/4/8/4/16=4.1


I swear I¬íve had this in the 22oz Bottle since my original rating, but perhaps not. This bottle is a 2009 22oz. The pasteurization and filtering are present and a bit denuding, but it does smooth out the edges. I find this particularly malty and leaning a bit goaty. There is that characteristic nip of acetic acid. Fluffy. Well balanced. I do think that by going to a stripped down, clean 22oz bottle presentation, they¬íre moving towards the mean and producing something more uniform with the style, but less distinct and exciting. 8/4/8/15=3.9","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

I remember when I first became interested in craft beer and artisanal ales, La Folie was the first sour ale I ever tried; at the original Liar¬ís Club while I was living in Mission Beach. I didn¬ít think this was the beer that would initiate a serious devotion for barrel-aged sour beers. Really, really good stuff. Hazy brown color with a one-finger head and good carbonation. Earthy and malty base character in the flavor that balances well with the citric sourness and lactic acid. Prominent oak wood notes linger on the finish. The use of champagne yeast for secondary fermentation gives it a unique mouthfeel. A mature and sophisticated beer in every sense. The 2005 Anniversary Vintage has been my favorite.

The aroma of apples and wine swirled above the New Belgian snifter.  The first sip of the red entity delivered an all-new experience in beers.  The presence of the wine barrel was clear.

The wood aging is apparent on the tongue.  This is, however, a really sour beer which relies on brute force to show its complexities.  As a result, the finish is a bit harsh and grabby instead of the smooth sour finish offered by Le Terroir.  Still, a fantastic flemish sour.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","jefcon"

Off-white head was medium and foamy with decent retention.  Fair lacing. Flavor:   Lightly toasted malt with a light caramel.  Sour kicks in early and strong.  Really sour.  Sourness reminds me a bit of a mix between malt, apple cider, and rice wine vinegar.  Some grapes, apples, and cherry flavors in there fairly strong.  Wood is strong, but not to strong.  Finishes very dry with some tannic dryness on the tongue.   Palate:  Medium bodied.  Moderate carbonation.  Overall:  This was a great beer to spend the evening with.  Changed alot as it warmed up.

Such an intense, acidic, mouth stripping character, this is right up on par with Cantillon in terms of intensity. Aroma was cherries, concentrated vinegar, wood and some light malt. Appearance is amber in color, hazy with a foamy white head. Mouthfeel is acidic and stripping, like swigging around acid of some kind. Flavors were like the candy WarHeads with an intense sourness to go along with the acidity that¬ís just off the charts.

The up-front taste was lemon juice, then the other elements of this massive three-pronged attack joined in; rubber, sugar, coriander, lanolin, orange zest - but lurking under all that sourness and funk was a massive, rock-solid thick sweet malt body that held up for the hour or so we sipped at this.

Updated.  An old bottle from the Brickskeller stocks, shared with Ken.  Red, slightly cloudy pour.  Aroma of balsamic, celery salt, some peat, and old cherries.  Quiet, but very tart.  Taste realizes this to the purest of burning sour perfection: white pepper, dill, cherries, and pears within a simply massive acid body.  Absolutely unmatched sour fire at the finish.  That slow pulse of dry, spicy acid that breathes on the smack is just perfectly executed.  A pure, transcendent example.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
3394,"2007-02-10",4.0,"Purple in a trappist glass.  Smells of sour cherries.  Sour, fruity, and strong cerry flavor.  Well balanced despite itself.  Very unique and flavoful. Be careful as it comes only in a 75cL bottle as far as I can tell.","Arkansas, USA","mrdeath5493"
3394,"2007-02-09",4.2,"25 oz bottle, via SecretSanta winter 2005, bottle no. 05-192.  Pours a clear copper with a pink to reddish hue under a fizzy beige head.  Generous carbonation yields a well retained creamy film.  Aroma is just beautiful.  Sugary sweet yet lightly sour, lots of sour cherry, apples, almonds, and vinegar.  Flavor is very dry and tart with a moderate acetic bite on the finish.  Sour cherry, apple cider vinegar, and chocolate nibs.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with great fine bubbled spritzy carbonation.  The finish just sucks the spit right outta your cheeks.  This was really very good, as we all know, but I gotta give the overall edge to both Panil and Le Woody Brune for being a little more drinkable.  The late finish on this just got a bit too bitey for me by the end of the 25 ounces.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

3394,"2007-01-25",4.8,"UPDATED: NOV 22, 2007 In short: Intensely tasty Flemish Sour that also offers a rich malty body.  Amazing stuff.
How: Many tasting sessions.  Never had a full bottle.  Latest sample (rated here) at Montreal-crew sour beer tasting.  Bottle from MartinT
The look: Cloudy dark red body with a medium beige head
In long: Straight to the point Flemish Sour.  Very sour.  Lots of cherry and oak sourness.  A little peppery-ish spicy too.  Rich body that offers more on the malt/caramel front than all other Flemish Sour except maybe the Earthmonk.  Somewhat fluffy body.  Woody and even tree bark flavours in there too.  The attack is intense, then the beer settles down and it becomes rich and round and after you swallow you get that intense comeback of spicy cherries and oak.  Might be my second favorite Flemish Sour right after the Earthmonk.  There are many things I expect to find in Colorado: mountains, cows, guns¬Ö but this Flemish Sour was quite a surprise.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3394,"2007-01-24",3.6,"Pours an amber red with a thick creamy light tan head.  Smells, of extreme tanic sourness, and mixed in with some apples and cherries.  I¬íve had this one before room temperature, but this one was ice cold and it seemed way more sour this time than before.  I get a lot of lemons, and tannin, some light citrus fruits as well.  extremely sour but still nice.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"

Vibrant copper with stunning clarity, a bit of a head forms, and disapears, there¬ís a fine film of tan bubbles coating the top of the beer. Nose is of biting, green apple skin acidity, cherries, raspeberries, and a bit of woody taste swimming in vinegar.In your mouth, the beer is aggressively sharp and surprisingly full-bodied, with just the subtlest hints of astringency and that acidic bite in the back of the throat. It hits your toungue with a lovely acidic start, followed by underripe raspberries, almonds and slight woody aspect. Vinegar is omnipresent here, and it¬ís lovely in this form. There¬ís a every so faint toasted bread there, It¬ís sour and tart, through and through, but it¬ís somehow balanced. Finish is fruity and vinegary with that acidic bite building in the back of the throat. Exquisite.","USA","JesSayan"

3394,"2007-01-13",3.8,"2005 Vintage. My brother lives in Denver and sent me 6 of these beauties last winter! I have been cracking them on special occasions, or when thirsty (always a special occasion). The last bottle was last week, and I have to admit that this beer is improving greatly in the bottle. My impressions last year this time were that it was overattenuated and not nearly as complex as the Rodenbach Grand Cru of 5+ years ago. Interestingly, the complexity is improving in the bottle with more complexity in the later tries. I am down to one bottle and will have to save it for a truly special occasion. Intensely sour, some woodiness, tart, and wonderfully crisp on the palate.","Reno, Nevada, USA","grease"

That said, I can tell that it¬ís a well crafted beer, especially for this style.  However, I like my beer to taste like beer, not Vinegar.  The people at our tasting were split:  Either people loved it, or wanted to barf.   I, unfortunately, was in the latter group.","Poway, California, USA","Naven"
3394,"2007-01-13",3.6,"Pours dark pink if that¬ís possible.  Very powerful sour apple/grapefruit aroma.  Flavor is dry and citrusy, some cherry and more sour apple.  Complex, but I find myself wanting something other than sour fruit.  Maybe I should get more used to it but at $30 a bottle, that will probably not be possible.

The aroma is fruity and woody. Medium body with a very tart character that does not mellow out much later. Sour fruit flavor offset by a bit of malt. Touches of spice and hops as well. The finish stays sour on the tongue and leaves a tart apple aftertaste that puckers my mouth. Fairly enjoyable despite not being one of my preferred styles.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

06 Bottle, opened on New Year¬ís Eve.  Initial pour deep orange, with some fizz.  Aroma is sour cherries and almost a champagne scent.  Initial taste is big sour and tart.  As it warms the sour mellows a bit, and the citrus and malt takes over.  This beer was enhanced greatly by pairing with dark chocolate.   (8,5,7,4,15 - 3.9)","Kansas, USA","theisti"
3394,"2006-12-31",1.9,"this might be my first sour but it will be my last. 13 bucks for this vile buttugly brew that was little more than hard cider with foam. The palate is fruity with a nice bloom of sour cherries and lemon. The caqrbonation is weak and short. The tart blasts on your tongue and just turns you mouth on its side. sorry.","Alabama, USA","vtmobile"
3394,"2006-12-25",4.2,"Bottle courtesy of Internet Wines & Sprits.  Poured a hazy copper with a small fizzy/creamy off-white head.  Aroma of tart black cherries, yeast, barnyard funk, and a touch of candy and caramel.  Flavor is tart but very balanced... light wild cherries, some wood flavor, lemony tartness.  Causes a bit of phelgm to congeal in the back of the throat, but still very delicately drinkable.  Very little toffee flavor, which tends to abound in the style.  A very refreshing, balanced, and drinkable sour ale.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"
3394,"2006-12-23",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2007 Fresh 750ml. Very lively pour, carbonation rolling over like an angry tide. Nothing like a sour brown at 10am, however not such a good combination with my Dunkin Donuts croissant sandwich. Aroma is of wood, wood, more wood and cherries and lactobacillus. Taste is very satisfying, very full bodied for a sour. The tart finish leaves nothing to be desired and fades beautifully into a cacophony of flavor. Would be great with baked salmon and asparagus.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

3394,"2006-12-16",4.5,"Tap at Mugs Ale House.  Cloudy, ruby tinted orange colour.  Amazingly tart nose, lactic acidity over sweet cherry and cherry skins.  Intensely acidic with a hint of wet straw and light acetic notes.  Very Rodenbach-ish.  Mouth-puckeringly tart flavour.  Fantastic, fruity, cherry/berry flavours.  Some blackberry flavour as well with soft vanilla notes in back.  Soft caramel notes underneath all of the tartness, but the flavour is still wonderfully dry.  Very resfreshing and incredibly complex.  Light barnyardy character behind the intense lactic/acetic notes.  One of the most sour beers I¬íve tasted, and one of the best.  The saddest thing is that I know I won¬ít see it again for awhile.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

3394,"2006-12-15",4.2,"750 ml bottle, caged and corked.  Bottle # 05-4260, purchased 7/3/06.  Pours a clear reddish amber with a thin off-white head that quickly diminishes to a wispy collar that has some legs.

The aroma is peppery wood, fruits, a tart acidic sourness and some sweet-tarts.

The flavor is a little sweet fruitiness quickly followed by a huge mouth-puckering sourness - kind of like the sour sweet-tarts.  The mouthfeel is medium to full and low on carbonation, but what little there is is pretty sharp and zings the back of the throat.

Overall, a very nice sour ale!  It¬ís different and not for everyone, but is quickly addicting.  It has much more in your face sourness than the Panil.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"

3394,"2006-12-04",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2009 2006 bottle #2529.  Pours a very dark garnet with brownish tints and a hazy body; head is beige, fizzy, pillowy, and somewhat full, but slowly falls to a small, creamy head with minimal lacing.  Nose is very vinous and complex with notes of sour cherries and sour apples, red wine vinegar, some earthy muskiness, and some malty notes of caramel and raisin.  Sourness is upfront in the flavor being very vinous with underlying malt notes and others.  Up front is sour cherries and sour apples with a sweet tart kind of taste; underlying notes include caramel, faint vanilla, faint wet oak, some light spiciness (hard to pick out which spices) and earthiness.  Palate is medium light, very lively, and refreshing with a good bit of tart acidity.  Ends still sour but with a moderate amount of earthiness and some oak; the flavor dries out some and lingers on the tongue for a while.  Only my second flemish, but better than the first in the sense that it had more underlying character underneath the rich sourness.  Not a beer I could drink everyday, but definate worth the money for special occasions.  After some other  sour beers under belt...  this one shows great tart sourness with complete underlying notes of oak and slight sweet flavors.  One of the better Flemishes from the US.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Outstanding sour aromas of woody, funky oak blends nicely with some chardonnay tannins and a squeeze of fresh lemon. A light fruity wave of juicy apple flesh and under-ripe pear skins compliment the acetic presence nicely, and are even sweetened by just a hint of maple syrup.  Hints of vanilla.  Light bodied, tingly mouthfeel that brings loads of rich, tart fruit flavors to the palate.  Perfectly intensely sour without being excessively vinegary.  Dry, yet loads of flavor complexity and a firm body.  I¬ím envisioning a freshly baked apple crisp garnished with a slice of cidery lemon peel.  A hint of white pepper spice lingers among the oak, leaving me to smack my lips appreciatively in the final smack.  Amazing brew.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

3394,"2006-10-17",4.4,"On tap into a small tulip, Falling Rock Tap House.  Finally, I get to rate this.  Smells freaking fantastic.  I smelled it for a full five minutes before daring to taste it.  Acid cherry and granny smith apple in the nose; something lurks in there reminding me of white zinfindel and sharp blue cheese (without the cheese).  The taste explodes like Enola Gay dropped it.  My eyes watered it was so intense.  More purely sour than any gueuze I¬íve had.  Fruitier than a gueuze, not as straightforwardly dry, but not as fruity and round as a Rodenbach.  Granny Smith apples dominate the taste with a lack of sweetness (although the taste contains cinnamon syrup and caramel), some cherry, and dark spidery yeasty things after the sour dies off.  Sour fumes even waft up into the nose from the back.  The finish is almost dry, but the acid keeps bringing up saliva, so it can¬ít really achieve it.  Body is medium, somewhat fizzy.  Officially dope, although doesn¬ít aspire to the heights; if the finish were more developed, or it were a bit more complex, would be one of my all-time bests.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"
3394,"2006-10-16",3.5,"Tap, Toronado. Fairly dark ruby color on the pour. Slightly sour vinous aroma. Some raisins and fig, along with some other dark fruity qualities. Sour and spicy champagne notes. Very tart and quite enjoyable.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
3394,"2006-10-15",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2007 Re-rate 9/6/07. This rating is for the special edition brewed for The Falling Rock Tap House anniversary. I couldn¬ít decide whether to give this a separate rating or not. It is a special blend of La Folie using all 10 Foeters (large wood fermenters). Usually La Folie uses beer from only 2-3. AbV is the same at 6%. I had it on tap at The Falling Rock. It poured a slightly hazy ruby red color. There was a ring of off white head. Aroma was of cherry, subdued black raspberry, apple, and light brown sugar. Very tart on the tongue with sour cherry, red wine vinegar (especially in the middle toward the end), and distinct oak. Delicious.


Original rating 10/15/06: Draft at the Falling Rock Tap House in Denver, CO. Attractive clear garnet color with a lasting foamy white head that laced the glass. Smelled of cherry taffy, apple, and white wine. Rich fruity flavor of melon, raspberry, and cherry with oak and alchol undertones. Extra tart on the tongue. 8/4/7/4-18","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"
3394,"2006-10-11",4.3,"2005 Bottle # 05-3838.  Cork pops out like agustus gloop up the pipe  in Willy Wonka. Luclkily, no beer escapes. Beer is sitting in the sink now, but I can already catch a waff of the aroma some 8 feet away Medium amber with a thick and carbonated off-white head. Crackles. Smell is oak, funk, earth, gummy cherries, sour cherries, lemon . Wow. Taste is much more tart and sour than I expected. Lots of l sharp lemon, slight cherry, vinegar, light sweetness, and a bit of alcohol. This is much more sour and mouth puckering than I expected for this beer or this style.  Maybe more similar to a more of a more deeply flavored champagne than I have ever experienced from a Gueuze. Intense and Enjoyable.

Appears a hazy red toned amber with a small white head that fades out into a small cap.
Smell is oaky, earthy, with tart cherries, spree candy, perhaps a touch of papaya somwhere in there...heavenly. 
Taste is of the same aromas with a spicy, wild bite that is outstanding. The oak is subdued enough that it brings out all of the tart, meaty characteristics that make this beer a winner. This is very much to the liking of Rodenbach Grand Cru, only better. There must be some magic on those Rodenbach barrels b/c everything that goes inside of them, comes out enticing my palate and making me want more and more.
Mouthfeel is spritzy, sugary, tart, balanced, and medium bodied.

Regular La Folie pours a dark red amber with a froth beige head.  Nose is yeasty, sour, slight funk with oak and acidity.  Tart oak flavors, fruit, and cherries.

10th Anniversary blend.  Pours a dark red amber with a frothy beige head.  The nose is less tart than the original.  The nose is overall subdued but the cherries, and fruit are really nice with a light oakiness.  The fruit is so strong in the flavor.  Cherries, cherry pits, red and dark fruit with malts blending well.  Vinuous, earthy, leathery, light oak and acidity.

Warming wraps around the tongue, sourly and tanicly, while reveling in the ultimate sour complexion.  Medium-bodied, sticky, souring and invigorating as the tonsil¬ís cleaver.

Thanks to hezron for popping this one open late in the night.  It made a
   fitting nightcap to a night of excellent, amazing beers.  It also made a
   great finish because after this one, I couldn¬ít taste a thing for the next
   four hours.  This definitely puts the Sour in Flemish Sour.  The one opened
   at the tasting was bottle 98 of the 2002 batch.
Aroma / Appearance - Sour, funky cherries, sweaty socks and musty
   old books are the hallmark scents of this aroma.  I almost imagined a cedar
   note hiding in there as well.  The huge head settled down to a half-finger
   and then soon to nothing.  Eventually all that was left was a murky cinnamon
   colored liquid.
Flavor / Palate - There is only one way to describe this beer.  Sour.
   You either love it or you hate it but you can¬ít miss it.  The first sip was
   not bad, the second intense and by the third it felt like I¬íd come down with
   either a serious case of strep or just consumed four pounds of Sour Patch
   Kids.  If there was anything live in your throat beforehand, it is dead now.
   I fall in the camp of those who love it for that intensity.  A very one of

Too sour with no malts or cervesae yeasts to be found anywhere, kind of tastes like the aftertaste of when you vomit. Strong stomach acids churning the throat and tounge.

3394,"2006-07-23",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 7, 2011 Bottle provided by BeerandBlues2, thanks Brad.  Shared this at NYRBG.  First of all, FUCKING WOW.  This is the best sour beer I have ever had.  Aroma is a good Kriek, akin to Drie Fonteinen Kriek.  Tarty, sour and cherry.  Taste however is amazing.   It starts out Sour kriek lambic-esque.  But then becomes a strawberry sweet taste.  Aftertaste isn¬ít even tart but sweet.  Mouthfeel is pillow-y and smooth. 8/4/10/4/18 Re-rate, 04/23/07: 2004 bottle, 3 years old @ Blind Tiger Ale House.  A very different beer right now, has take a lot more traditional characteristics.  Earlier had the DdB on tap and definitely notice a similar vinegar taste but no where as strong in the La Folie). Also has taken on a heavier muskiness. It was not as ""airy"" as the fresh bottle was.  Sourness has become stronger and a bit more acidic.Re-rate: Well I have been missing the old La Folie and this has especially been highlighted in a recent vertical.  05, 07, 09, and the new bombers.  Basically, the 05, now 4 years old was stellar.  Still strong and sour but a bold fruit sourness, just how I remember.  Still hints of strawberry in there.  Some age was present as it wasn¬ít as bright but still going great.  This was almost a completely different story with the 2007 bottle.  It already is showing a whole lot of age.  There is a cheap acetic quality mixed with cardboard. Very weird to come across something like that.  The 2009 (last 750mL batch before the bombers) was similar just without the cardboard.  Still that dull acetic character, strong but not in the same way the 05 bottle was.  And now we move onto the bombers.  The beer would almost not be recognizable as the same beer as the 2005 bottle.  This head much less sourness then any other.  There was also a weird burnt aspect to it. Now in general that beer is not bad but when put in comparison to the glorious 05 bottle it¬ís just such a weakling. So the overall experience with this beer would range from around 3.6 to 4.4.  I guess the rating I will give it will be the middle score. 3rd beer of blind tasting.  Dark cola color with reddish hues, head fades quickly, has a halo lacing.  The beer glows in the light but no clarity.  Aroma is sweet, very musky, cherry, slight acetic and works great in the beer.  Very natural sourness and refreshing aroma.  Flavor is sweet cherry juice with tartness all over the place and nice drying sourness in the finish.

The head was present, more of a ring of head around the eges of the glass. The lacing was decent, not outstanding. On the thinner side of Flemish Sours in appearance. The aroma was solid, tart cherries and citric tartness came through most strongly. Tangerines after a few minutes. This thing got better in aroma and flavor as it warmed. The flavor was all of the aroma (tart cherries most prominent), vinegar was notably lacking, essentially absent relative to its peers (this came across more like a fruit lambic than a flemish sour, imo). Definitely sour and tart, but not incredibly gueuze funky (like the Panil). Light wood notes, but again subdued. The mouthfeel was light for its style, but carbonated and subsequently zingy with an additional acidic character.

Flavor followed, nice tart bite, strong tart cherries, finishing with a firm sawdust touch. High carbonation in the mouth, lively, spritzy, red grapes alive with warmer temperatures. A beautiful brew and a big thanks to Robert who I believe originally gave this one to me anyway!!! Rock on, SSSSLT¬ís!!!! Re-rated in Sept of 09 as a ""Lips of Faith"" bottled brew, not nearly as impressive, perhaps I wasn¬ít in the zone for a sour, don¬ít know: extremely sour and tart, acetic, cherrie flavors were harsh (but the Avery Sui Generis was had right before it, which rocked).

I¬íve tasted it at the brewery about half-a-dozen times and every time I can¬ít decide whether its intensity is a good thing or not.  I¬ím leaning toward not, but I can¬ít bring myself to discredit it completely.  It is definitely a sour, and I mean ssssour, oak-barrel-aged brown ale with some interesting things going on underneath the veneer of vinegary palate.  But it¬ís tough to get a real sense of the underlying notes when the sour malty-vinegar is so darn prominent.  So that¬ís the conundrum of LaFolie.  Oddly enough, my girlfriend, who is not a beer drinker, loved it.  And my friend who¬ís had fifty-million different beers from Belgium and all over ¬ñ well he thought it was crap.

3394,"2006-04-09",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2007 On tap at the Toronado. I¬ím not sure that I will ever see this sold in my home state. It was delightful to find it at the Haight. Pours amber with a white head. Has the aroma of 1N Acetic Acid. This is a very very sour beer. It¬ís like sweet tarts sour without the sweet. No lacing as I suspect the ale actually solubilized parts of the glass that contained it. This is far closer to battery acid than anything I¬íve had from NB before. Way too astringent for everyone at my table. Some even refused to taste it after smelling it. Obviously, I loved it. UPDATE 12/2006: The amazing Beertopia in Omaha now carries this in the big bottle. I¬ím still holding out for the kegs. UPDATE 1/2007: ON tap at the brewery hospitality house. The battery acid burn remains disturbingly strong. I can get a wisp of oak flavor out of the huge sourness. The aroma is no where as vinegar as it was at Toronado. The color is a dark auburn. There¬ís still a residual chemical burn palate. If you work it, you just might get apricots in the nose. This beer could make an astringent beer cry. I¬íd guess the pH is 3.7. UPDATE: New Belgium tasting at Max & Joe¬ís Tavern on 10/18/7. Seems like it has a very fruity aroma now not unlike grapes. This is still followed by a slight nasal acid burn. Ruby dark amber in color. Nice medium-sized off white head. very wine-like today. The tartness does not seem to be as unbalanced and the beer does not come across as straight battery acid this time. I¬ím starting to really enjoy the intermittent oak flavors that sporatically blast through. I ease the score up one tenth of a point to 4.1
UPDATE: Falling Rock blend of La Folie at New Belgium tasting at Max & Joe¬ís Tavern on 10/18/7. Huge carbonation and a big head. Darker than regular La Folie. Sweeter and maltier as well. The aroma is not as good as reg. and seems to be a bit toned down. The sweetness is like a spider inviting you into her web: it is super tart and very acidic. Burns the esophagus. The palate is not smooth at all. this is just like drinking vomit acid. Perhaps this needs a bit more aging?","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","SledgeJr"

Brownish caramel, with just a thin head that tapered off quite quickly.
That great balsamic vinegar aroma was present, but with an extra spicy cinnamon in a Quelquechose kind of way, with a touch of musk and just enough alcohol to make me think I was smelling an old bottle of perfume I found in some dusty attic.  Marvelous!
Good carbonation, the wood doesn¬ít take center stage, it plays more of a backup role for the solid body and sour cherry flavors to glimmer in the spotlight.  I don¬ít know if it¬ís the type of wood used for his barrels or just the aging process that wasn¬ít as pronounced as most others (that would be my fist guess), but the brewer seems to have determined the perfect combination in order to get the smooth oaky flavors from the wood yet without sacrificing body and soul to get it, giving la Folie a more complex and satisfying taste as you¬íll ever find in Flanders Reds/Flemish sours.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

Very sour all the way through - but again, much more approachable than it used to be. It¬ís dry, sour and woody. Not lemony sour, more apple sour. Try it. It¬ís fantastic.

Cloudy, orangish brown witha tight white ring.  Excellent dry and sour aroma: winey grape and woody cherry with some perceptible malt too.  Unfortunately, the flavour did not reflect so much the nice aroma: sour dill pickles with a little cloves.  Too vinegary for me, but I guess that¬ís the style...  Some nice malt comes out at the end with some mild bitterness.  Mouth puckering with plenty of carbonation.

<P>
I bought a bottle of this in Denver and saved it for a tasting in Tampa. But, I got so schnockered that by the time we opened it I was far past the ability to rate anything. So when someone..who I have now forgot, but is an incredible human being...sent me this I was quite happy.
<P>
Aroma is sour balsamic vingerarette with woody and sour cherry notes. Color is hazy red/orange with a mostly fading thin white head. Fore is identical to the aroma...sour and woody. Overripe fruity notes compliment a delicate feel on the palate. It is actually more carbonated then I remembered and this beer is older than the one I had before, but that carbonation tickles the tongue nicely in conjuction with the sour fruit-mostly sour cherries-notes.

I¬íll admit that any sour beer style automatically does very well with me, and this is no exception.  Pours a perfect amber, golden orange that gives way to magnificent yellow hues as the tulip glass tapers.  Thick head dissipates quickly, leaving not a trace of itself, but still lending lace to the glass.  Aroma is vinous, sour, and dusty.  Hints of lemon and flowers, maybe even a trace of seville olives.  Flavor is initially lemony and sour, somewhat salty, a hint of burlap and hay,  sour grapes, cobwebs, wood, and a dry, sour finish.  Change that:  extremely dry finish.

3394,"2005-10-29",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2014 May 12th, 2013 - Here¬ís the treat of our tasting. The beers are lined up like the drinkers - two parallel fines facing off in a gorgeous LA loft. But the radian shining comes from one participant: New Belgium¬ís La Folie, a bottle from 2006, and aged 7 years. This was the first bottle I ever aged, and I held onto it for awhile for the simple reason that I never felt ready to taste it. It was a work of art beyond me ability to recognize it. But I felt different this week, and endeavored to share the experience with good friends on a happy occasion. What immediately strikes me is how complex this beer has become over time, and how dull and clumsy the fresh 2013 La Folie smells and tastes by comparison. On the nose, caramel, bourbon, pear, swirls of cinnamon, clove, honey, and the sweet honeyed baklava, or a more northern treat: belgian waffles. The flavor has also mellowed considerably, with a nimbus cloud smoothness, a touch of pomegranate, smears of strawberry, watermelon and white grape juice, backed by very subtle, very supple notes of leather, and even the smell of age that surrounds a good bottle of balsamic vinegar. It¬ís a moving beer, and everybody agreed that it was one of the best beers they¬íve ever laid hands upon. (4.5)

May 12th, 2013 -  I¬íve had New Belgium¬ís La Folie before, but this was something of a special occasion. My friend and I gathered in his picturesque loft/Designer¬ís Bat Cave and arrayed before us a parade of high-quality brews, which included two brothers paired for comparison: one La Folie from 2013 and another La Folie I had been storing since 2006. Fearing that it would soon go sour in an unpleasant way, I felt its time had come to shine. By comparison the 2013¬ís scent was totally flat, muted, and awkward, It had all the acidity and expected tanginess, but none of the depth, complexity or attractiveness. The mouthfeel, in spite of its youth, felt chewy and heavy, and the champagne and white grape notes were strong (others might also report apple cider vinegar here in the flavor.) The directness of the flavor is a bit like licking the side of the burnt barrel, in a good, but unsweetened kind of way. But in absolutely every respect the 2013 version (brand new as of drinking) pales in comparison to the aged brew, which was a mellifluous experience. (3.9)

La Folie is a furtive juice indeed, a deceiving bottle of beer with a most mysterious demeanor, closer blood relations to the Champagne noble family then its beer brethren.  One of the best parts about La Folie is purchasing it.  The liquor store guy shoots you a quizzical look, assents to your confident gaze and delicately plucks the bottle off the shelf and hands it to you like a nurse handing a new mother her baby.  The bottle comes with a ¬ìDo Not Disturb¬î sign strung onto twine for a calming bucolic effect.  You can tell that it demands respect: the bottle is covered in a thick dust like a newly uncovered treasure descended antiquity.  Opening the bottle feels, by instinct, like sacrilege.  Just remember that La Folie is brewed to be imbibed.  Its ultimate ambition is to trickle down a grateful esophagus.  Don¬ít deprive it of that.  
Of the beer I have equally epic thins to say.  The color is difficult to describe, something like a shade of sullen emotion, or mayhaps ¬ìtempered rage¬î.  I don¬ít foresee that becoming a Crayon color anytime soon.  The foam is light in texture and color, and the smell is salty and vegetable like, with a lot of alcohol to form the base.  The taste is far sweeter, like premium champagne, replete with citrus tastes and green apple.  La Folie is also very creamy; a churning river of taste but relaxed.  The paucity of this beer may thwart some who seek its golden touch, and the price tag will intimidate those who do find it.  If you are such an adventurer, do not make the mistake of turning your back to it.  Buy it, hold it, embrace it, care for it, love it and drink.  You won¬ít regret it, because life hardly gets any more luxurious. (4.2)","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
3394,"2005-10-28",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2005 I would be lying if I said this brew wasn¬ít one of the paramounts of my beer tasting experiences so far. It is not the best I¬íve had, nor is it revolutionary in its style. However it has been long on my list, building anticipation and it did not disappoint. Since I¬íve been in Colorado it has been one of my goals to get a hold of this precious elixir. It was not a cheap acquisition at $20 a bottle, but I can surely say it was worth it. My experience with sour ales is admittedly narrow, with Rodenbach¬ís Grand Cru as the only representative. Yet their mysterious flair has only furthered my curiosity and appreciation of the genre. The pour was exciting and truly a stressful experience, one only matched by fine wines. The hue is difficult to describe without remaining in the realm of clich√©s, but I would call it a dark Cognac orange. The liquid was clear yet deep and nearly opaque, a very mesmerizing effect. Like looking into a cedar abyss. A frothy custard-colored head rose above to slowly diminish leaving thick airy lacing. The aroma is sharp as a blade, I was almost afraid my nose would be sliced off if I got too close. Sour apples and cherries, Champagne, generous brown sugar and a slight metallic twang resonate in the nose. The fragrance is simply delectable. As I took my first sip, I noticed the carbonation was not as lively as I had expected - pleasantly so. This Flemish Sour is surprisingly smooth and creamy, a quality I wouldn¬ít expect to match the intense tartness. Vanilla, oak and light banana notes add to the effusive bouquet. Every sip is a wrapped gift that slowly unveils itself in your mouth. As it moves back in forth on your tongue, you uncover different parts of the flavor. When I finally swallowed, the acerbity left me grinning with pleasure and warm satisfying sensation ran through my veins. The finish seems to last forever and the light sour aftertaste lingers until your next sip. A remarkable brew by New Belgium which I hope to enjoy again some day.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

I¬íll have to admit right up front that I¬ím not a big fan of sour ales but I was willing to give it a try. It arrived in the tasting glass a nice rich orange color with a head of fine bubbles. I was warned to save it for last in my tasting so I did. The aroma was very sour (as you¬íd expect) and the first sip was very sharp. After a few sips my palate settled down and it began to taste almost of lemonaid. There was no strong hops in either the aroma or flavor but they came back in force when I later burped! Talk about a lasting impression! All in all I think this is a good solid example of the style.","Savannah, Georgia, USA","Silenus"
3394,"2005-10-17",3.7,"Draft. reddish amber beer with a nice off-white head. Huge sour aroma. Sour/tart flavor with some berry fruits and oak. Sour with some pop rocks at the end. Doesn¬ít stand up to Roddenback - a lot of the same characteristics are there (and given the brewer, they should be), but this one was a bit of harshness around the edges where Roddenback really just pulls everything together nicely.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
3394,"2005-10-16",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 31, 2009 Beer 1100!  Huge thanks to Secret Santa Crosling for this beauty!  Bottle #4-1066.  Slightly hazy amber with hints of orange, perhaps ruby, good initial head died fast.  Aroma of sour cherries and a bit of light chocolate cake.  Complex layers of flavor - sour cherry, wood, with chocolate faint in the background.  A bit of yeastiness, perhaps a nod towards caramel.  A superb example of the style, fitting for a milestone rating.  Perhaps better than the numbers here suggest. RERATE: 8/29/09, Relentless Thirst, Lips of Faith bottling.

Notes of funky geuze, sourness, tannins, oak, wet old leaves (like the way a forest smells when you walk in it after a rain), acidity, tart black cherry, unsweet dry apples, and must.

I expected less, and this has turned into one of the best beer experiences I¬íve ever had.","≈Å√≥d≈º, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

Poured a deep copper amber - clear or hazy depending on which pour you got from the bottle  (sorry John, yours looked a little muddy!).  Sour fruits - apples, cranberries, raisons, bing cherries, etc.  Excellent sour/tart taste with a very dry earthy and woody finish.

Poured a fairly still ruby red color.  The aroma is sour apples but I also smelled a bit of cherries and some sweetness to it.  The flavor is all about tart.  Cherries and apples show up again in the flavor after the initial sourness lets loose of your taste buds.  Fades into a quite tart dry finish.","Concord, California, USA","ChillCoat"
3394,"2004-12-27",4.2,"This was a gift from my Secret Santa, pdee.  I would have thought that a beer aged in/on wood would have been mellow, but this was anything but mellow.  It pour like fresh pepsi.  The carbonation snap crackle and pop was really suprising.  Even after it had settled in the glass it was fizzing like crazy.  The color was deep ruby with little to no head after it had settled.  I don¬ít think the fizzy bubbles would have allowed it.  The aroma could be smelled from across the room.  A sour ""dark"" fruit smell.  Despite the violet fizziness in the glass, it rolled over my tongue smoothly.  There was no vineger here like my beloved Duchesse. The taste was fruity with a very tolerable sour.  I was very dissapointed I had no one to share it with.  Great stuff for a special occasion.  Thanks again to pdee.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","shadey"
3394,"2004-12-21",3.8,"Farmyardy, sharp, vinous aroma - very Belgian sour. The flavour is also tart and noticeably woody. Some balsamic vinegar and citric fruity notes. Sour finish.

3394,"2004-11-29",3.8,"I¬ím still a little surprised that a brewery as large as New Belgium would bother aging a beer in wooden casks for such a small distribution, but hey I¬ím not complaining. This is a bazarre beer right off the bat - sour apple flitting throughout the aroma and giving an initial impression of cider for sure. Dried cranberry/cherry tends to give precedence here, although the yeast is making a valiant effort. The apple is more apparent in the flavor, but the natural sourness reminds me more of cranberries that anything else. Semi-sweet spices in the yeast give further impressions of cider, but nothing battles the tartness.  I wonder what this would taste like without the aging process, probably border-line undrinkable. Definitely one of the more sour flemish beers I¬íve had, but surely worth the strong reaction.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

Wonderful!  Mild sour fruit, some hints of wheat, light wood, faint vinegar, and perhaps an underlying sweetness. Body is mildly acidic and is definitely tart.

Aroma of cherries, balsamic, quite sour and tart.  The flavour was just fantastic.  It was tart, very acidic, lots of black cherries, woody, lots of vinegar.  High carbonation, creamy mouthfeel with a large body.  Finishes with a very long cherry tartness.  Just a hair below Rodenbach Grand Cru in my books buts its almost to close to call.

3394,"2004-11-23",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2006 Bottle @ the DCVAMD Gathering.  Gettin on in the night. . .haha, my notes say ""fruity"", but fortunately I dont take long notes and do remember this one very well.  It pours a dark amber with strong peachy/auburn tints throughout, small white head, good retention.  Aroma leans more to some darker fruits, raisins, some sour blackberries, black cherries, pungent yeast.  IMO, the American brewed flemish sour, proved the most funky of the day, though it hardly means much seeing as how the yeast strain was taken from Belgium (which I learned from Joris).  I also never got to try the PP Le Woody.  Moving on, the flavor is a mix of what I can best describe as ALMOST spoiled fruits: strawberries, tart cherries and pomegranate seeds.  Deliciously yeasty and sour to the extreme, this one had a musty, earthy, woody feel to it as well, especially on the finish.  Yes, I do believe I will be trading for some of these.  A touch more body and this would be near perfect.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3394,"2004-11-15",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2012 FOBAB¬í04: Grapefruit heart red. Funky horseblanket nose, strong and sharp. Extreme sourness at first sip, exploding tartness and fruity flavors, including Cherries, cranberry and green apple. Some vinegar notes and acidic, nearly toxic tones that made it almost exciting on the tongue. Souring, facepuckering at the finish, it left a wondeful sour, woody, and tangy taste on my lips.

The enthusiasm that most people had about this beer was not mine. Tasted other flemish ales before but not to this degree. I tried to enjoy the flavor but it was too overbearing. It wasnt the sourness, the dryness just the vinegar taste of a old wine gone south. Sorry not my cup of tee.","Queen Creek, Arizona, USA","Steib"

Unbelievable aroma. Cherries, sour apples, a bunch of mixed berries and you can definately tell it is oak aged.

Big and sour flavor profile. Sour cherries, sour apples, grapes, marachino cherries and lemon up front, the mid-palate is full of watermelon and the finish is unbelieveable and lingers on for hours. Many dry lambic qualities. 

If you take a big gulp of this sacred juice and swiss it around in your mouth like mouthwash, your mouth will expand like a helium balloon. The mouthfeel is full and leaves my mouth sticky and begging for more.

Complex aroma that is sweet, sour, fruity and has a touch of alcohol.  Flavor is very sour.  Almost vinegary.  More fruit and oak in the flavor also.

I got far more sourness than sweet and it all veered off toward lambic territory more than I¬íd hoped.  Oakey and tart, but falling short of massive New Glarus Raspberry Tart tartness.

Sourness has diminished, body is not as polished and carbonation is somewhat detached. Wow, my favorite beer has changed. It¬ís still an excellent Sour Ale, but it is not my favorite any longer...

Previous batches:Triumphant citric intensity displaying its sour marvels onto the sagacious wood¬ÖEminent fruity (cherry, cranberry) caramel balances out this intensive and passionate balsamic tartness and achieves perfection in the flavor department¬ÖA massive body shows confidence and nourishment and propels this to, for me, the quintessence of a Flemish Sour sipper, surpassing the great Rodenbach Grand Cru in my tastes¬ÖFar from folly or craziness, the patient wisdom and brilliant strength of its intricacies can only be equalled by the ocean magnificent¬Ö

Recently, I had the incident idea to mix a sip of La Folie with a bite of vanilla ice cream...Oh my...May I please have the luxury one day to have enough La Folie for myself to attempt a Folie float...Amen.

The yeast addition in the second half of the bottle seems to embolden the raspberry aspect of the fruitiness and adds an earthiness to the flavor profile. A dirtier second glass which doesn¬ít shine quite as much as the cleaner first one, but which might offer even more flavor. Having a bottle all to yourself is a sin. I am proud to call myself a sinner.

The 10th Anniversary Falling Rock edition was in the same tooth-licking good category, while not displaying the same full body and harmonious m√©lange.

3394,"2004-07-30",4.8,"Amber-copper body is darker than I expected. Honest off-white head with above average retention for the style. Aroma explodes with oak wood character. Lova at first sniff you¬íll call it. Cedar, vinegar, wood chunks, it¬ís an obsession. I feel like walking in a forest right now. This is more than I can handle. All kinds of little red fruits provide these admirable fruit acids to marry the balsamic. Farmy taste, nostalgic, elegant, very fruity, cherry and raspberry reminding. And that oak, marvellous oak, wood among the wood. Blue cheese hints, cider-like dryness is explosive in the finish and adds just a bit more class to a drink that really didn¬ít needed anymore. Perfect level of acidity for the style. Perfect medium-full body with tongue-cleaning carbonation. Great stuff, mind stimulating.

Appearance: Murky reddish brown topped by a small off-white head. Big bubbles popped up occasionally and replenished what eventually was a scant film of small bubbles. Wisps of lacing were left on the glass.

Aroma: Oaky and brassy tannins bitchsmack your nostrils like a rented mule. Then some heavy and tart cherry aromas kick in. Peppery twang and whole lotta funkiness.

3394,"2004-03-31",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2004 Bottle # 90604, Sampled June, 2004
It is with great anticipation that I open this bottle.  I want to see if this can displace pre-Palm Rodenbach Grand Cru.  After having multiple samples of this at the GAZBF, I knew that I needed a bottle for myself.  This beer pours a lightly hazy deep ruby-amber color.  It has a lively carbonation, which generates a fluffy light brown head.  An absolutely intoxication, enticing aroma wafts from my glass.  I get notes of cherry, balsamic vinegar, raisin, and a certain woodiness.  The taste is dry up front and finishes with a strong note of acetic acid.  With my second sip I get a hint of sweetness up front.  The finish is still dominated by woody notes of balsamic vinegar.  While I do enjoy the vinegar component it is a bit too strong in this bottle, it dominates the flavor profile, muting the other complex notes that should be here.  This is definitely a ""hard"" sour brown ale, the acidity is very domination, it is almost too much.  Don't get me wrong, I really am enjoying this, but New Belgium has a little ways to go before they dethrone Rodenbach GC.  I actually think that this recipe has great potential, give them a few more years and La Folie with be where it is at.

The aroma is woody, as well as sour & wonderful. I could smell this beer quite a bit. My first thought upon tasting is that this is a bit more acetic, and a bit more earthy than Rodenbach Grand Cru. It is of course nice & tart, and there is a hint of caramel sweetness to it. It is fruity up front but still quite dry. The finish is dry and tannic with a nice woodiness to it. Sharp is a good description for this beer. This is a wonderfully put together beer, and I can't wait for them to get the ATF approval so that they can ship this to my local. Quite impressive, and I think that I like this a bit better than the Rodenbach GC.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3394,"2004-03-29",4.3,"The beer as it pours from the bottle a bemused reddish-amber color, the head smallish in size, creamy in texture and the color a winsome light tan color, with the lace a fine velum like curtain to drape the glass. Nose is tart and simply reeks of over ripe fruit with a pleasing oak and earthy aroma ¬ìWOW¬î what a treat for the old schnozzle, start is tart and nicely malted with the top fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is stern in its acidity, hops delightful and accommodate the fruity tart sweetness quite well, very dry and long lasting aftertaste, what a magnificent beer it is a real treat, and one I wish was more readily available, hopefully soon is what I here, can¬ít wait to put some of these in my cellar.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

Very good- this is trying to be the american version of De Dolle Stille Nacht and it's not a bad copy.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
3394,"2004-02-19",4.0,"The aroma is dry, slightly sour and woody, though still sweet with hints of marcipan. The color is orange-brown and it has a fine beige head though disappearing.

Creamy, off-white head with whispy retention.  Amber body, very nice, classy appearance.  Aroma is mostly light wood, oaky, and slightly of sour cherry.  Very lovely nose.  Incredibly tart, sour cherry flavor, with stinging hotness and spice.  Quite surprising to find the heat on this, but it's very good.  The finish comes wonderfully smooth with subtle, sweet malt, drying and almost chunky with complexity.  This beer is all over the place with wood-aged qualities, but they mostly add up (and never detract) to make this just very unique, and one damn fine all-around beer.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

3394,"2003-12-16",4.0,"Deep, muddy brown with a fizzy, disappearing head that moves it from perfect to above average in appearance.  Tart, sout, woody aromas permeated the kitchen upon the pour and the living room as it warmed.  Flavor characteristics were somewhat lacking in comparison to the Rodenbach Grand Cru I had the night before.  Very tart, sour apple, less-than-impressive malt development to interact with the woddiness towards the finish.  More one-dimensional focus on sour/tartness than the RGC, but still a very good beer.  Tart, lingering finish that leaves you coming back for more.  Not bad by any stretch, but not as developed and complex as Rodenbach Grand Cru.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

The taste was very tart and twangy with fruity and woody undertones. An fullout attack upon the palate. A lip pucker for sure but you finally adjust and are able to find the complexities beneath. The mouthfeel is dry and crisp, very lively. There is something about this beer I was unable to describe, but then I said enough, wonderful.

3394,"2003-11-24",4.1,"Very pleasent sour experience.  As other raters have said this is sour, sour, sour.  I could have used just a bit of sweet in here somewhere, but oh well.  Look forward to another bottle sometime.","Bedford, Texas, USA","TChrome"
3394,"2003-11-14",3.3,"Timing is important in so many things - and beer tasting is no exception.  I had this Flemish Sour style ale at the end of an afternoon of sampling many big, robust, sweet ales and stouts.  So my palate wasn't quite ready for this.  Nice appearance, cherry-amber color, cloudy and a small white head.  Aroma of grapefruit, sour mash and hops.  Flavor is sour cherries, spice and more tart fruits.

3394,"2003-10-18",4.6,"Beer #713 (My Lucky Number):
2002 Bottle #3370
Reddish amber colour with dark brown highlights and a thin tan head. Trillions of small bubbles rise from the bottom if you look real close. Sweet, sour, pungent aroma which makes the mouth water. Some sour fruit smells mixed with nice fruit tastes and a maltiness which is fairly noticeable. Light-bodied; Very sour flavour that shows some character and complexity all the way through the finish. The beer coats the mouth and leaves a nice flavourful sourness at the end. Some of the flavours remind me of raspberries or pungent cherries. Some slight woody and peppery flavours finish out the beer, although they are a bit subtle. Overall, I really liked this beer, and I wish I could have it every day. I thought that this one would be my first 5.0, but the depth in the taste really just isn't there for me to declare this as perfect. This style is really growing on me, and this is a great example of the beer. I have to thank CaptainCougar for sending me this one...i'm really lucky to try it!

3394,"2003-10-12",4.6,"2002 bottle #170.  Mouth orgasm!  But let's say more about this....  Without knowing the style to expect in advance, I looked at it and thought, ""o.k., I'm going to get a Belgian dubbel"" but then there was a reddishness in the hue that jogged vague memories about what had been said about the beer and realized it might be a Flemish red ale.  Hzy brown and red color, and the bottom sediment adding a nice dimension to my glass.  And it is a good thing, too, because otherwise I might have been caught off guard by the Cantillon-like nose, a  pungency not quite the barnyard of a gueuze (more pure than that) but also sour.  The aroma, which didn't seem as complex as some European beers, also was fruity with strawberry and raspberry.  In the mouth, this was sour up front, sour in the middle, and sour late.  There were also some nice bubblegum, candy, and taffy flavors.  The only flaw was the pounding acidity on the back of my throat.  The only slightly-above subconcious problem I had was that I didn't know whether its American origins made me doubt the ""authenticity"" of the experience.  But other than the existential questions, I loved this beer.  A HUGE thanks to Acrodizer and lemonlovr for bringing this down to Dallas for me to share with them!

Hugely sour and dry on the palate... what a wonderful experience.  Tart tart tart.  Syrupy baked fruit and stingingly beaufitul performance on the tongue.  This was an amazing experience.  The second it hits the tongue it is sharp and stinging, with a well enjoyed harsh finish... makes to take a few breaths before having the next drink as it mimics the feeling of sucking the air our of your lungs and the moisture out of your tongue.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Old Notes needs to be updated. Please send bottle to me so that I am may update the rating properly.Tart apple aroma. Hints of yeastiness also. Murky brown with an off-white head. Tastes sour.

Color is light brown of nutmeg-like color and a highly bubbly/fizzy head like a soda pop. And pop it did, both in smell and taste, smells nice and appley sour, sweetly tangy, brown sugar, and highly potent in the sourness, like lemon peels, grape peels, orange peels, and grapefruit peels. Greatly accentuated in earthyness. Taste is way sour, almost to sour. Major sipping going on with this . The sour is of bright sour apples and grapefruit, some what lemony as well. Very strong and sourly tart. It'll make your taste buds go crazy and your lips tighten. Pucker up baby, cuz your going on a ride. Its pretty much like drinking straight lemon juice without the strong lemon taste but all the sourness. Whew, I barely made it through the sample of 6 onces.

Initial sip is very full and almost overwhelming, mirroring the aroma but doubling the complexity. Lingering palate, the sharp acidity diminishes fairly quickly, leaving a slight musty/earthy flavor. Should be reserved for only beer geeks or those who delight in such wonders as Sour Patch Kids. Lingering sticky head; cloudy dark rust tinged crimson.

Hazy/murky rust colored beer with a small off-white fizzy head. Mostly diminishing, but leaves very nice lacing.
Interesting aroma to say the very least. Cherries, basement must, cobwebs, earth, dark fruits and French or American white oak. The flavor is strictly of cherries, citric acid and wood.

It hits the back of your throat and it puckers up like a snare drum.  Very reminiscent of a lambic beer at times, but still distinctly tart.  I think I could drink several bottles in one sitting.  Just an outstanding beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

Strongly kriek like to me, only with the substitution of a flemish sour ale sourness for the acetic sourness a lambic.  Elegant in a way that belies the fact that it is an american made beer.

3394,"2003-03-11",3.9,"This one started off fairly iffy, but wow did it really come through and impress the hell out of me in the end. It pours a deep amber color with definite browns and reds mixed in to create a cloudy soup of flemish sour aledness with a tiny white creamy head. The aroma hinted at cherries, some lemon, a tarty berryness, and an acetic sourness. Total flemish sour ale taste...nice balancing of souring tarts and mellowing sweet cherries. A grapefruity cherry sour explosion in the mouth near the ending...dry and tart, but oh so mouth appealing. I want MORE!

3394,"2003-03-09",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2009 Medium brown color. Medium head. Aroma is sour and malty. A sour Flemish Red. Malts are prevalent, but the sour/tart flavor shines through on this beer. Tannic with a touch of fruitiness, raisins and apples. Well balanced. This is so very close to a Rodenbach Grand Cru its amazing. Perhaps the only difference is the La Folie is a little bit thinner in body and a touch woodier. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is tart and sour. YUMMY !! 

La Folie (2004)

Sampled on 11/27/2009. So this is a 5 year old La Folie. This sour pours a reddish color from the bottle. Medium sized white foamy head. The aroma is fruity, malty and tart. A medium bodied sour. The malts are fruity and sweet, yet there is that nearly overpowering tartness. Five years of aging has added some malt flavors and mellowed the fruitiness. It is still tart and acidic, perhaps the tartness has been taken to a new level. It is still and excellent beer, somewhat different, but still unmistakably La Follie. Wish I had a few more bottle of the old stuff around¬Ö Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is tart.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
3394,"2003-03-08",3.5,"Had from bottle at the Pizza Port 12 Hour Belgain Ale Festival on March 8, 2003#70 on your programs.  Wow.  Definitely a kick in the ass to get ya going.  The beer has a very smokey aroma - almost like it was brewed right next to a BBQ.  The aroma also had faint hits of sweetness, but was mostly overpowered by a vinegar/sour smell.  The beer appears creamy with a tan head and fair amount of lacing.  It's clear, with an amber/red color.While I absolutely loved the Rodenbach Alexander (one of my favorite beers), I found this one a bit too sour.  Don't get me wrong - it's filled with flavor - but a bit too acetic for my liking.  Kudos to the brewery though - I had many authentic Belgians on this day, and this one was able to definitely hold its own.","Orange, California, USA","Blake"
3394,"2003-03-03",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2006 2002 vintage on 2/27/03 : Apparently the NB brewer previously brewed for Rodenbach and he has done an amazing job of creating a Flemish style ale, with an aggressive sourness, in the US. Personally, I was shocked that this beer did not come straight from Belgium.  I have two bottles, the beer is wonderful to drink now and I¬íll cellar the other for a while. New Belgium is brewing some great beers of very varied style.
ReRate: 2nd bottle 4/7/2006 the sourness is too pronounced at the finish leaving a vinegar impression. Downgrading slightly.","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","Jayb0"
3394,"2003-02-28",3.9,"This is a beer snob's beer. It's not for the wimpy BMC types. Nice brown color w/ hints of orange, this is a great example of a flemish sour ale. It starts out quite sour, but finishes slightly sweet. This certainly is not for everyone; I could never drink it as a session beer, but once in a while, you need to drink a beer of this class in order to fully appreciate the beer spectrum.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
3394,"2003-02-21",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2005 Colour: dark brown with orange shine, yeast cloudy (in suspension). Thick brownish head, disappears fast in any but tulip glass.
Nose: extremely vintage-wine-ish. Tones of oakwood, acetic acid, lactic acid, and esters. Fruity tones like blue grape, orange rind, sherry.
Taste: expressly sour, but fades for a much more fruity taste. Tannin-rich, seeped wood, even a bit resinous. Lactic acid, hints of acetic acid. Citrussy tones, but this time more lemon-like.
Mouthfeel: seems much thinner than it really is, because of high acid levels. Sharp, quasi-burning sensation, as you would expect from such a beer.
Aftertaste: no new aftertaste. Vintage oak-ripened vinous taste goes on and on.
Whether Peter Bouckaert does better at Fort Collins, than at
Roeselare is open to debate, but this is world-class without a shade of doubt. 

 Update for  2005  version. Very gueuze like, aged gueuze with Pinot Noir hints.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
3394,"2003-02-08",3.7,"Murky plum colored; very little head- strange; Aroma of wood, musk hint of tart- very nice indeed. Sharp slap to the face with the sourness. Smoky woodiness. Dry in the back of the throat and mouth- almost abrasively so. Lot sof dustiness. Small hint of sweet grapes. An amazing representation of the style IMHO.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
3394,"2003-02-04",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2003 it poured a murky brown with hints of orange lighting the bottom and edges..the top settled with a thin ring of tan around the edges and living astronomy in the middle..madd oak notes and vinous qualities bombard your nose..such an oily inhale..with subtle notes of chocolate creeping in the background and a kriek-like cherriness keeping the complexities out of mind's reach...the flavor was extremely oaky and the mouthfeel was tremendously oily, it was down right amazing..one of the best palate pleasers I've ever had..very vinous in flavor too.with just the right amount of puckering sourness..this beer is like licking an expensive italian leather couch..its just so tremendously pleasing to drink..this american version puts other ""authentic"" ones..to shame.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
3394,"2003-01-13",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 16, 2007 Special 10th Anniversary edition sampled on 10/13/07: Pours a clear orange amber with a well-lacing ring of white head.  Sweet tart cherry and oaky nose has some slight earthy notes.  Very well balanced flavor has a slightly sweet caramel malt character with a big, fresh tart acetic oaky presence toward a drier, puckering finish.  A great blend (8,4,9,4,17).

Rerated alongside Panil Barriquee and Zoetzuur 10/10/05: Deep copper ruby color reveals a sweet, sugary tart cherry aroma with some vinegar.  Body has lots of acidity and sugary cherry sweetness, but compared to the other two just seemed more crude and not as well balanced.  Still a fine beer, but it¬ís tough to compete with more authentic versions.

Original rating 1/13/03: Dark copper with a thick off-white head.  Strong tart, oaky aroma with sweet fruity notes.  The flavor is very tart but smooth with a nice woody character.  This is an amazing American replication of the Flemish style (8,4,8,4,16).","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3394,"2003-01-13",4.1,"Very tart, tangy, but not astringent.  A deep brown color with a nice head.  So tart that it makes my eyes water at first.  Very good for something brewed in USA.  Not terribly sweet and a good mouthfeel.  Reminds me slightly of the the Cantillon 1900 Grand Cru except more balanced off the tart side.  Very enjoyable.","Washington DC, USA","jskendzel"
3394,"2003-01-09",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2006 Handsome bottle.  Cork removal was extremely lively.  Tight dirty white foam, which clings nicely, with a strawberry juice color liquid.  This aroma tops Rodenbach Alexander with its lush juicy strawberry, passion fruit, subtle musty wood, concrete wall basement, medicine, and appley firmness; perfect touch of funkiness.  Literally fuzzy carbonation;  like eating a cobweb.  Leathery soft palate.  Flavors begin rather balanced with a puckeringly juicy, leathery middle.  I cannot discern whether I just bit into a piece of soft leather or sipped from an authentic Flemish Sour.  Tartness is matched by modest amount of astringency, which leads to defined, sharp ending notes bursting with juicy fruit gum and metallic tinges  with a whisper of balsamic vinegar.  Very nice example.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3394,"2002-10-12",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 20, 2003 (#0676-2) Strong aroma, strong alcohol taste.  Tart/acidic.  Unlike any of the other beers New Belgium brews.  
Rerate, addition: (#2795-02)  This stuff is great.  At first, my palate was not developed enough, nor is it still, to fully appreciate this.  The tartness is great, not overdone.  Fair amount of carbonation.  Quickly diminishing head.  Almost a champagne mouthfeel.  Best of all my girlfriend loves this stuff, so it's never a chore getting her to go to the brewery.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AustinMilbarge"
3394,"2002-09-08",4.1,"Berries, spices and apple in the nose. An easy and accessible brew appreciated by all those at the table tonight. Ebbs into apple skins, some sour fruit, a lightly tannic and earthy finish. Wow.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
3394,"2002-08-30",4.5,"I¬íve had all 3 years and they keep getting better.  The ¬í02 is still young resembles a lambic.  Very tart, oak flavor  and low carbonation.","Cedar Knolls, New Jersey, USA","gbzia"
3394,"2002-08-18",4.6,"Hands down the best interpretation of a Belgian style by any North American brewer. Right up there with Rodenbach. Sweet/sour, woodsy, vinuous, everything I like in a Belgian sour is here. Very well made.  I¬ím glad that I live near the brewery and can get more any time.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
3394,"2002-08-17",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 26, 2010 Sweet, sour, acidic and zesty. Brisk and invigorating carbonation with a mouthwatering ""zing"" to it. Somewhat thin-bodied, but not uncompromising by any means. Vinous, woodsy, and salty. Somewhat alcoholic finish is disguised well behind a wall of flavor. Reminded me of a Rodenbach Grand Cru. Sour couldn¬ít be so sweet! RERATE, 2002 bottle in 2010: Carbonation mellowed. Time has been good and bad. The good: Aromatic wood in the nose, syrupy-sweet malt base, big sourness. Flavors lingered nicely. Some sea salt notes. Nice vanilla aromas from the wood. The bad: Acetic acid seemed a bit strong. Acidic acid, too.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
3394,"2002-07-15",4.0,"Long-anticipated example of the hallowed Flemish red ale style. Provacative aroma of raspeberries and passion-fruit.  Light body, small effervesence, but HUGE tart acidity.  Iron, cidery flavor. Very freshing, and very interesting.  Deserving of it¬ís neo-classic status.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
3394,"2002-06-01",3.2,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2011 2011 bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy medium to dark amber. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain/nuts), with notes of cherry, sour apple, wood, light notes of vinegar and pineapple. Flavor is moderately sweet, heavily acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, heavily acidic, moderately bitter, slightly unclean. Medium body, watery texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, moderately to heavily astringent. First re-rate since 2004, can¬ít believe I haven¬ít tried this in seven years, especially considering it¬ís much easier to get now than it was back then. The nose is pretty plain and uneventful...I seem to remember this having all sorts of weirdness going on, but it¬ís quite dull these days.  Not much, if any, wildness in the nose. In the mouth, it¬ís still as sour as I remember, but there¬ís a fair bit of bitterness to go along with that, and the aftertaste isn¬ít very clean.  I¬ím disappointed, I must admit.  Not that I was ever a huge fan, but it was a cool, funky sour back in the day.  Oh well.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3394,"2001-11-04",4.0,"Slight haze, chestnut colour, fizzy carbo; deep nose - rich red malts, acid - very true to style.  There is a good dose of acidity right off the bat, followed by a heavy tannic influence and light raisin; from there the reddish malt, acidity and wood all bounce around the palte.  This is somewhere between the Rodenbach Red and Grand Cru, with a flavour so similar to the Red that you are forced to compare the two, but with a bigger body.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
