1582,"2014-04-11",2.6,"I need to stop grabbing these cheap small bottles of sake. This one pours like lemon lime soda. Nose is sugary citrus drink. Tastes of only hints of rice and sake, more like a 7up or spritzer. Plenty of sugar, some melon, and alka seltzer. I do feel this would be good for a hangover though. But in general not good.","New York, USA","Jow"
1582,"2013-07-04",2.6,"Bottle from the Seiyu Supermarket. Lightly cloudy, light carbonation. Fruity nose, citrus, but faint and not complex. Extremely sweet flavor, 7Up, melon. Sugary and far from authentic. This is a childs sake. Way too sweet and simple; more like a soda. I dont hate it, but cant take it seriously, and am dismayed by how over-rated it is here. A sake for Japanese youngsters who hate sake.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
1582,"2009-10-27",4.0,"This bottled sake from a bottle shop poured a large sized head of frothy fine to medium sized white colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a slightly hazy very softly carbonated white colored body and a oily lacing. The mild aroma was plastic. The crisp mouth feel was tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a bubbly aftertaste. The nice flavor contained notes of plastic and rice.  More like a champagne sake. A decent one that I would consider buying again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1582,"2008-08-23",3.6,"330mL Bottle @ Ryo Izakaya in Torrance, CA: Mostly clear except for a small layer of sediment on the bottom. Once mixed together, it looks like the water you’d pour out of a milk carton you’re rinsing. Almost silvery. I did a little more vigorous shaking than I should have to get everything suspended, which resulted in a mini-geyser, but that’s ok. The nose is lightly fruity with melon and a hint of flower blossoms, a faint koji puff and very little alcohol. Clean body and a sweeter flavor. Approachable and bubbly, fairly fruity flavors for being uninfused. Maybe the best sparkling sake I’ve had, but it’s still in the realm of ""easy"" sake. Sake which makes its living off of distancing itself from real sake, which can be amazing. This is simply palatable and approachable. I now see the sarcasm in austinpowers’ rating.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1582,"2008-04-01",4.0,"Bottle from tonraner on  3/24/08.  Interesting to try a sake at 7.5%.  The Jizake name is another Japanese marketing faux-pas when selling to the US.  Up there with pocari sweat.   I thought they were much higher.  Also, this is first sparkling sake Ive tried. Also, nigori sakes are usually cloudy, this one is clearish.  There is a white sediment in the bottle, which I will try at the end.  Yeasty aroma when I peel back the cap.  Pours into glass with no head, but some bubbles floating up.  Aroma has some bubble gum, some licorice. A bit of citrus fruitiness in the aroma and taste.  Very, very much like a Ramune soda.  Pretty yummy.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
1582,"2008-02-24",3.4,"I would say it is a bit overated so far. Aroma is a bit citrusy. No head, but a very fizzy body that is a cloudy, ghostly white color. Drinks like a soda, really harsh carbonation, sweet and fruity with a really dry mouthfeel. So-so, and pretty expensive.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1582,"2007-08-04",3.6,"330cL bottle.  Pours a hazy white color (which gets progressively hazier); slight head at the beginning that quickly disappears.  Soft rice and vanilla in the aroma, without any show of alcohol.  Pleasant, fizzy carbonation at the front of the palate, easing out into a very soft presence in the mouthfeel; on the sweet side, with light vanillas and rice and a mild toastiness; doesnt approach the complexity of most of the other sakes Ive tried, but its intensely drinkable and slightly sugary (everyone! will at least find this sake palatable).  Takes like a good sake mixed with soda water.  The complexity increases as the pours get hazier.  Clean, soft rice and bready finish.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
1582,"2007-03-11",3.8,"A cool, refreshing sake, with a spicy aroma, full-bodied, sweet, fruity taste.  Balanced with a medium finish.  Very accessible, not complex.  Great for newcomers to sake.","USA","ldr514"
1582,"2006-05-27",4.9,"A bit of poochi poochi makes me feel like floating. It is an unbelievable sake with soft taste of sweetness and sourness and fine bubbles. Also great to replace wine before dinner. DELICIOUS!!","USA","pjan"
1582,"2005-08-08",4.2,"Wow, this is fabulous. Bits of rice cereal, pears on a full, carbonation- pushed nose. Only slightly cloudy not the full creamy nigori feel and this is welcome and nice. Great as a digestif.  Baby diaper flavors. very novel and very cute. slightly particulate feel.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
1582,"2005-03-21",4.8,"Fantastic!  This is one of my all-time favorite sakes.  Of late, Ive started to tire of Nigoris because the alcohol can be a tad harsh, but this super-lo alcohol nigori is right down my alley.  Extremely sweet, with CARBONATION!  Easy drinkin, I tell ya.  Utterly delicious, with typical nigori creaminess and a slight bitterness in the aftertaste.  Perhaps over-carbod a bit.  Touch of cardboard taste.  I LOVE this sake, but I know I shouldnt.  Its the white zinfandel of sakes.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
