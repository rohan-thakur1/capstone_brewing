2771,"2014-11-03",3.5,"On tap at 2+KK, Prague, as Chýně Polotmavé Nefiltrované 12°. Went to this venue for dinner, as a part of my choirs (AZ FFZG Concordia discors) Praha Cantat 2014 performance, ran into an unexpectedly fine beer selection. This one was a no brainer as soon as I saw it on tap. Murky brown amber body with an off white head. Smooth, creamy aroma, caramel, vague, fine toastiness, lovely maltiness in general. The taste develops a mild malty background, giving off vague coffee, countered with a herbal hop foreground - a remarkably well hopped polotmavé.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"

Non-typical beers will receive personalized descriptions after the express ratings.-------- />
How: Tap at brewpub (Pivovarský Dvůr Chýně, Hostivice, Czech Republic)
The look: Partly cloudy amber body with a large beige head
To me a typical Czech Polotmavé (Czech Amber Lagers) is: Hay and biscuit wrapped in caramel.  Very light fruity notes with no specific fruits giving the impression of slightly fruity caramel.  Moderately sweet.  Sweetness is well balanced by dry grassy hops.  Body is smooth.  Medium carbonation.
This one: As above but low in intensity.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2771,"2008-03-27",3.5,"En fût. Pinte dégustée à la brasserie. Arôme: Odeur de caramel fruité. Apparence: La couleur est ambrée foncée. Présence dun large col mousseux et dune fine dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Goût de caramel fruité et de céréale. Durée moyenne de larrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture légèrement aqueuse. Faible effervescence en bouche. Présence de caramel en arrière goût. (Rating #1526)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","TaktikMTL"
2771,"2008-03-24",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Hay and caramel peacefully coexist, chatting and smiling away with the herbal hop flavor and bitterness until a dryness increases and a dusty yeast clinches this rural Polotmavé.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy throne of foam enhances the hazy dull amber.
-The mouthfeel is cozy, offering enough residual sugars to offset the active carbonation.
-The malt character and the herbal hop presence are ably balanced.
-The finishing hop bitterness is tea-like and unyielding.
