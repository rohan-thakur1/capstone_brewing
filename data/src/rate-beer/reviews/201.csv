201,"2016-04-13",3.6,"Pours a hazy golden with a small white head that leaves good lacing. Lots of particles in suspension. Nose is of pine, cereals and some alcohol. Taste is of pine, light floury cereals, fruits and something that feels like granulated white sugar. Moderate body and carbonation. This is not a real kölsch of course, feels more like their IPAs than anything. One of their less successful ones if that was the case, but still. Fun to try but I dont think I would get again.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

201,"2016-03-21",4.4,"Overall a great beer! The European hops really shine through and elevate this Kolsch from good to great. Pours a light hazy yellow with an off-white head. Aroma plays to the hops character. Just a really enjoyable brew! If you can find it, try it!","Amesbury, Massachusetts, USA","MrMeadMan"
201,"2016-03-15",3.8,"Poured from bottle into a tulip: Pours hazy golden with a decent white head. Aroma dank, light citrus, very tropical. Taste is a little grapey, pale and munich malt, tropical notes, with a solid hop bite at the end. Medium body, soft carbonation, not the style it is listed as. Cheater beer (but tasty).","Willington, Connecticut, USA","bellco33"
201,"2016-03-12",3.4,"Bottle shared by William. Pours hazy golden orange with medium sized top and lacing. juicy tropical smell but a little sweet grape forward and overly bitter in the flavor profile. Other notes of grass, cracker and grain. Painfully dry finish. Boat beer at a drinkable 4.2 % puts this to shame.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"

201,"2016-03-09",4.0,"Bottle (750 ml). Shared by JulienHuxley, thanks! Split 2-ways. Hazy golden with a medium white head, moderate retention, leaving some lacing. Aroma is of perfumy hops, dank, mild spiciness, a bit of resin, grass and doughy malts. Taste is dank and grassy with doughy malts, mild spiciness, a bit of resin and mild bitterness. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Clean. Crisp. Dank and grassy finish. I dont see how its Kolsch inspired but its a really nice beer nonetheless. The 7.5% abv is really well hidden and this is mightily drinkable. Another awesome hoppy beer by Trillium.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

201,"2016-02-20",3.8,"Thanks Claaaarrrk for sharing this growler. I love Kolsch beers. Cant find them fresh

A - Very hazy, gorgeous orange with a very small head. 

S - The Nelson is strong with this one. So much fantastic aroma with grape skins, apple, pears. mmmmm really smells great.

T - Really good taste. It has this table sugar essence at the finish and I wish it were a lot more dry. The hops used were perfectly picked, the sweetness is not great. Even has a slight bit of coconut.

M - mild carbonation, sweet throughout with a good effervescence

O - Decent beer. would have it again would like just less sugar.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

201,"2014-10-28",4.1,"Pours a murky orange with a rapidly diminishing tan head. Aromas are absolutely delicious waves of mangoes, citrus, and grape. Theres a certain spiciness that seems like it must be from the yeast. The flavor is slightly more subdued, lots of grape candy. The hops are joined by some barely-there bready malts and a hint of alcohol. Smooth and thick body with just enough carbonation.I have a slight preference for (little) Sprang, but this is great!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ScipioA"
201,"2014-10-24",4.3,"Pours a hazy orange with a thick white head. The aroma is lemon, tangerine and orange with some pine notes. This is incredibly juicy. Certainly not in the style of a kolsch.","Westfield, Massachusetts, USA","dogfish120love"
