3700,"2015-01-03",3.0,"March 15th, 2013 - Heres the second beer of the day here at San Diegos Epic Beer Festival - a malty, Irish red. Its got the flavor, but not the mouthfeel, weighing a bit too lightly on the palate, and more closely imitating Killians Irish Red than a brew with a bit more body. Give this a little more muscle mass and and Id really dig it, but as it stands its a touch too light for my personal preferences.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
3700,"2014-10-05",3.4,"vast amount of hops that are present in this beer (given the style). way hoppier than an irish red should be. definitely an ""american"" red ale, no matter what they call it. the hops and carmel and slightly nutty malts pair well together, and this is indeed a nice session ale. just dont expect a traditional irish.""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

3700,"2014-05-27",3.4,"A hoppy aroma accompinied with a malty sweetness come from this hazy red ale with almost no off white head. A hoppy bitter dry taste at first with a sweetish malty flavor in the middle with a bitter and alcoholy taste on the aftertaste. Its pretty decent minus the haziness Its light medium bodied with decent carb. Worth a try pretty good.","Marysville, California, USA","Koskela"
3700,"2014-02-08",3.4,"Pours a thin head on a hazy rust colored body.
The aroma is barley and malty all the way through.

3700,"2013-11-18",3.1,"Pours a rich copper penny color with a piney nose aroma. Taste is clean and simple with a grapefruit aftertaste. Notes of earthy pine needles mixed with a floral film left on the palate after the swallow. An slight IPA style finish with a quickly dissipating bitterness. A good Irish Red beer.","Diamond Bar, California, USA","Barreras"
3700,"2013-06-14",3.9,"Great dark ruby-red color with a head that is even rather orange itself. Hoppy nose dominates malt scent, lot of grapefruit and pine. Taste is super hoppy (more grapefruit and pine, plus orange) for an IRA, which I personally find extremely yummy, but with a robust, earthy caramel malt presence that stands up to the hops very impressively. Very easy to drink. Maybe too hoppy for the a traditional IRA, but a very good offering by Rubicon.","California, USA","fezzy"

3700,"2012-10-04",4.3,"Super hoppy Irish red ale. Strictly for the hop heads. Rubicon makes some tasty beers and this is anothrr example. I like my Irish ales to be big on the malty side. This one is all thr way on the hoppy side.","Santa Clara, California, USA","mrhoppy"
3700,"2012-07-08",3.8,"Fresh hops and raisin filled malts come through on the aroma. Deep, smokey brown color with a small foam. Relatively thick, dark malts upfront with subtle, grassy hops floating about in the back. Strong carbonation and full bodied. Overall, this is a good quality brew with primarily malty flavors and a subtle boozey finish. Id give this an A rating.","Los Angeles, CA, California, USA","Thisis12ptfont"
3700,"2012-03-27",3.3,"Bottle from SED. Ruby with a tan head that settles into a thin film. Aroma is citrus hop. Flavour starts with a little malt but quickly drifts into bitter hop. Fruity and dry bitter palate.","Berlin, GERMANY","culchiem"
3700,"2011-12-16",3.6,"Bottle. As expected this pours a deep copper red color (surprise!) with a light tan head that slowly settles to collar around the glass. I am a little surprised in the nose as it has a nice citrus hoppy note along with caramel. Medium/light  mouthfeel. Caramel, slight roast, apple, and a little citrus rind round this fella out. Slight lingering bitterness. No real notes of the 7%. Overall, a decent beer that overdelivered on my expectations. I would like the mouthfeel a tish heavier on it though.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
3700,"2011-04-01",3.9,"Poured into a pint glass.  Color is a ruby brown with tan head that quickly fades.  Aroma is malty with strong hop notes as well.  Flavor is smooth and malty on the start but finishes with a slight hop bitterness and light hop flavor.  Medium bodied and slightly creamy mouthfeel.  Overall a good Irish ale.","Elk Grove, California, USA","bnoel09"
3700,"2011-04-01",3.6,"Poured from a 22oz. bottle. Colour is dark amber. Decent off white head. Aroma is of hops primarily, malt secondarily. Flavour is malty up front, and bitter dry in the back. Mouth feel is medium full body, with a dry finish. Overall not what I would classify as a Red, More of a IPA.","West Sacramento, California, USA","thetmaxx"
3700,"2011-04-01",3.8,"Thanks to Hayduke for sending this my way.  Enjoyed it with him and his brother Rick via Facebook chat.  This beer looks like a cola with the dark brown and red color.  Its head looks like a root beer but it doesnt last as long.  Soft aromatic and spicy hops lead the aroma.  Only later does malt show up.  The flavor begins with the expected rich malt but then those hops show up.  They are pine and citrus and grow as the beer warms.  The malt begins to resemble rye and this beer becomes much like a rye IPA.  The hops were a very pleasant surprise and made this beer delightfully multi-faceted and very tasty.  Thanks Ron!","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
3700,"2011-02-24",3.2,"In cask at Monks Kettle. Pours a very hazy amber with off-white head that dissapates quickly. Aroma of biscuity malt - you can taste it by the smell. Think meadow of sweet malt. Medium mouthfeel is very well-rounded and coating. Slightly sweet malt gives way on the mid-palate to cereal and grain malts, with strong, spicy hops.  Lingering bitterness with sweet malt on the lips.","Redwood City, California, USA","Zymurgeist2"

3700,"2010-04-11",3.9,"Pours ruby copper with a nice tan head. The aroma is very hoppy with citrus and minerals taking the lead.

3700,"2010-03-15",3.8,"Nice, fairly hoppy, red ale. Red ales arent normally my thing, but I picked this up because I typically cant find Rubicons at my grocery store, and I was pleasantly surprised. A well balanced ale; coppery taste and smell, some honey and caramel in there,  not too sweet or malty; rich all around. Not your typical red ale.","Davis, USA","leiris"
3700,"2010-02-13",3.9,"Appearance: Pours a clear dark red. Atop, sits a big dense tan head.

Aroma: Citrusy Amarillo type dry hopping, caramel and red apple skins.

Taste: Spicy sweet malt, burnt sugar, and a mild but noticeable hop bitterness that lingers.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and a tad creamy.

Overall:  A really nice red ale. Please dont let the name fool you, this is much better than your typical Irish red. The malts are nicer, and that California kiss of hops takes it from good to great.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

3700,"2008-03-21",3.7,"Beachwood BBQ and the brewpub. An interesting Irish Ale, as this had a nice hop profile in the aroma and flavor. Copper color with a beige head. Aroma of hops - citrus, pine, earth with some mild toffee and some roasted malt. Not initially sweet up front, more of a moderate earthy bitterness, but toffee makes its presence known in the finish. Finishes rather clean with a light dryness. As it warms it becomes sweeter and balances out the initial hoppiness.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
3700,"2008-02-09",4.0,"Pint on tap at the brewpub.  Lightly sweet, sugary malt nose present with some hints of citrus orange.  Some cereal and grainy malts, too.  Nice aroma...quaffable.  Moderatly hazy amber body with a medium tan head and ok lacing.  Herbal, sweet, malty, brown sugary flavors in the start and in the middle.  Towards the end, this becomes quite hoppy with piney, orangey, and some light hempy hop flavors, too.  Centennial and Simcoe hops perhaps?  Either way, not a true Irish Ale, per se.  This is closer to an ""Imperial Red"" in the mold of Yulesmith, which is definitely not a bad thing.  Yum yum.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
