3140,"2016-10-14",4.0,"Bottle; Pour is murky red/violet - but purple sounds better than red/violet - either way- gawd damn. The nose is cherry juice and skins, raspberry tart - as well as lemon rind presence. The carbonation is limited and fades to oblivion rather quickly. The flavor profile feels like De Garde - which means Im becoming familiar with the terroir of their product. Its acidic, sweet tart - cherry/raspberry fusion , moving to a musty, grassy, dry finish line. Moar, please.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
