844,"2013-10-03",3.7,"Tap at Bowie. Hazy yellow-orange,some true to style green tints. Foamy, nice head. First sip is sort of intense, comes off a little stronger than 6.5%. Malty and rich, but also has a tasty, grassy, noble hop character. Pretty solid, captures the style well.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
844,"2013-09-28",3.5,"On tap 5 oz. sample at DuClaw in Bowie, MD. 

Clear, yellow-gold with an off-white head and excellent lacing. 

Aroma of Italian bread, pilsener malt, grass, a clove-like spiciness that seems to show up in many of the beers from this brewpub (I.e., DuClaw's Bowie location). 

Taste of crackers, pilsener malt, that same clove-like spiciness, grass and floral hops with an aspirin-like bitterness. 

Medium/light body and high/medium carbonization.

844,"2013-08-07",3.7,"From growler purchased at arundel mills location. Aroma is lightly floral, citrusy and herbal. Appearance is crystal clear straw-yellow color with a pillowy white head, white you would expect from a pilsner or a pale lager. Taste is sweet at the front of the tongue and is bitter on the back end. There is a significant hop presence throughout. Overall very refreshing i would get this more often if it were year-round offering.","odenton, Maryland, USA","srobi003"
844,"2013-08-04",3.5,"Draft at Bowie location on 08/02/13.  Came to the table a clear gold color with a thick off-white head.  The lightly floral aroma featured a fair amount of grapefruits, zesty citrus rinds, a cereal graininess, light vanilla, a little funk, and a dash of spiciness.  Went down thin to medium-bodied, crisp, and refreshing.  The taste started with a sizable graininess and a touch of caramel.  A lightly funky middle with touches of vanilla extract came next.  Zesty citrus rinds, some grapefruits, and a splash of artificial lemon juice finished things off.  Bitter and dry.  There was a fair amount of warming alcohol throughout.  Thirst-quenching and enjoyable.","Washington DC, USA","lamas"

844,"2008-08-08",3.5,"Draft at Bel Air. Pours a translucent golden with a white head. Aroma of pilsner malts, biscuit, and dried herbs. Nice sweet and  firm pilsener malt backbone countered by leafy and spicy european hops bite that carries through to the clean finish. A hint of light honey in there as well. Perhaps a tad on the sweet side for me.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"
844,"2008-08-04",3.4,"Draft @ Bel Air location May 2008.  A good beer, very drinkable, but not hoppy enough for an imperial.  The DuClaw website says this beer is 7% abv, not 6.5%. Either way, I prefer Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner","Maryland, USA","NomDeBeer"

844,"2008-07-27",3.7,"Draft@ Belair. Medium sized white head, good retention and some stringy lace. Clear golden hued color. Nose is soft, grassy, light citrus and honeysuckle notes, lightly bready. Med/light bodied, surprisingly crisp and lightly oily on the palate with a nice carbonation. Clean malts, a touch toasty, bready, grainy with laid back spicey flowery hop flavors, apples and a nice bitterness to cap it all off. A tastey lager indeed.","Ceciltucky, Co., Maryland, USA","sloth"

844,"2008-06-19",3.2,"Draft @ Arundel Mills location. Pale golden color.  The flavor was really sweet, bordering on cloying.  Lots of fruit and honey type flavors with a mild grassy hop finish, some graininess.  Just an okay kind of beer.","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"
844,"2008-06-11",3.5,"On tap @ Arundel MIlls-Clear golden color w/a slight white head. Floral hop aroma. Crisp, clean floral hop flavor; has good character but the hop doesnt knock you over. Had some citrus flavor to it as well as a little carbonation. Very drinkable, sesson type brew which was easy to enjoy w/o thinking about it too much.","Powellville, Maryland, USA","beachbum25"
844,"2008-05-16",3.5,"Draft @ Arundel Mills location.  Pours a reasonably pale, honey-orange color; copper-like appearance; off-white head with excellent, fine-bubbled lacing.  Candy sugar, citrus bitterness, and some toasty malts in the aroma; slightly elusive nose, but a clear, clean hop character.  Lively, almost sharp carbonation (and served quite cold).  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: chewy, resiny citrus and earthy hops upfront (minimal astringency); oranges and toasty malts and sticky sugar at the core; tasty and a lot more drinkable than many ""imperial pilsners."" Lengthy finish, showing zesty citrus and oranges; some dry hop bitterness.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
844,"2006-06-08",4.0,"Damn!  This is the definition of an Imperial Pilsner.  If you can catch this at Duclaw, GET IT.  Seasonal brew that ran our real quick.  Received t-shirt from release party which is rather cool.  You can have too much before you know it.  Follow up with the Venom...","Westminster, Maryland, USA","themadmumis"

844,"2006-05-04",4.0,"Nice-sized draught sample at the Bel Air location.  Fully lasting, beautifully bright white snowcap atop the clear, bright golden body....absolutely tremendous, huge, intoxicating aroma offering overripe bananas, light fuesal alcohol notes, sweet almonds, vanilla and faint noble hops as grassy freshness exerts itself....the body is lightly sweet, with lots of dry herbs, but very full and a touch sticky/syrupy....vanilla shows up here again with lots of fruity esters and faint alcohol growing with more and more sips, golden raisins and a bit of dry cherry....very full with quite low carbonation, somewhat harsh and astringent to finish but overall edgy, distinctive and surprisingly drinkable and enjoyable.  A joy; best from this fine brewer Ive had yet.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
844,"2006-04-30",4.0,"2006 version, 7.5% ABV.
On tap, from growler. Poured out a bright golden yellow color, with a volumous white head. The head is thick & dense, like meringue. Aromas are of sourdough bread, sweet malts, delicate fruitiness. Flavors are of yeasty bread, strong malts, slight fruitiness, and earthy hops. Thick mouthfeel, rich & creamy. Slightly bitter at the finish from Noble hops. Slightly sweet aftertaste. Alcohol is well hidden, even in the aromas. Decent take on an Imperial Pils, but light on the alcohol.","","Cobra"
844,"2006-04-25",3.6,"Draft... Clear, yellow lager with a small, creamy, white head. Grain and toffee aroma. The flavor is malty-sweet up front, but very well-bittered on the backside. Notes of honey and grapefruit rind. Full-bodied and silky with lively carbonation. Balanced finish. Sweet, then dry and grassy. One of the better pilseners Ive tried!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
844,"2005-09-05",3.6,"Poured a golden color with a small, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of grassy, and floral hops, light resin, and caramel malts.  Taste of grains, citrus hops, vanilla, and dough, which was balanced by a medium sweetness that eventually took over.  Medium bitterness in the finish, with a touch of alcohol as well.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
844,"2005-07-29",3.4,"(draft) Clear straw body with white head.  Aroma is mild, medium sweet, cereal, some grassy, apple.  Taste is medium sweet, grassy, apple, cereal.  Medium body, some crispness, quite drinkable.  Seems more like a regular pilsner at the high end of things than an Impy, but maybe that is just me.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
844,"2005-07-15",3.7,"Draft at the Mills - Clear sparkling gold, thin creamy white head.  A true to style nose of spicy German hops and florals, with underlying grassy and sweet bready tones.  Deep sazz hops flavors hit up front, but as it warmed, more florals and a light malty sweetness play out to keep a nice balance.  Lighter side of medium bodied, sharp fizzy carbonation, clean, crisp, Sahara dry bitter finish.  An extremely drinkable pils and worth a try if youre in the area.  Nice job Jim!","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
844,"2005-07-13",3.4,"Pours medium transparent tan with a medium fluffy white head. Aroma is of buttery malts and spicey/grassy hops. Flavor is full pale malt, slight butter (not diacytellic) but pale malt butteriness that I like to see in imperial Pilsners and medium spicey, mildly grassy hoppiness, full bitterness on the finish. Very solid strong lager.","Silver Spring, Maryland, USA","jeffin7"
