4277,"2016-10-15",4.1,"Sampled at GABF 2016 with Paul and Larry. Thanks to Fly for the heads up on these guys - enjoyed many drinks with Swift and Amos. Pours a bright, pale yellow body with fresh wispy white lacing. Nose is super clean grassy character and soft bready malt. Mouthfeel is absolutely divine for the style - super clean, crisp and sessionable with a great amount of flavor towards the backend. Nice notes of crackers, pale malt, soft spice and grass; or as Amos would put it, ""LAGER BEER! LAGER BEER! LAGER BEER!""","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
