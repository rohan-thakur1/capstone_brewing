2500,"2014-05-11",4.4,"Bue au Craft Beer Co. de Clerkenwell. Probablement la surprise du pelerinage, intense zest dagrumes dans une marre de chocolat au lait. Le corps est étonnament respectable et sa finale légèrement rotie est tellement adéquate. Tour de force tant quà moi.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
2500,"2014-05-09",2.9,"6th May 2014Craft Clerkenwell. Cask. Opaque dark brown beer, small bubbly tan head. Palate is light and dry with fine carbonation. Light thin dark malts, watery dark chocolate. Mild roast bitterness, well buried. Equally mild lactose. Something vaguely citric before the light dry finish. A bit thinned out but not too bad.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"
2500,"2014-05-02",3.5,"Cask at Cask PK. Black, small tan head, full lacing. Aroma - chocolate and citrusy hops. Body is light, smooth. Taste is very hop forward, astringent lime, some watery ash. Very drinkable stuff. This is apparently made from the remnants of their imperial stout - Im looking forward to that.","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"
2500,"2014-04-27",4.0,"Bottle at home in London - picked up in London. Pours deep, black-brown with a large, thick, lasting beige cream head. Great aroma, lots of burnt pine, dark chocolate, great roast. Light sweet flavor with nice overriding dark roast character, some burnt sugars, a bit of piney bitterness, subtle milk chocolate. Light bodied with fine, massaging carbonation. Finishes with moderate sweetness, earthy and burnt pine bitterness, cocoa, grapefruit. Extremely solid. Smacks of beer much stronger than it is. This is like a black IPA-lite. Well executed.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
2500,"2014-04-26",3.8,"Cask at CBC Clapham, jet black with a coffee crema yet a bright hoppy nose. Roasty bitter-sweet Milton choc and burnt bitter.","Brentford, Greater London, ENGLAND","BeerViking"
2500,"2014-04-25",4.3,"Cask at the Harp. Aroma of tanned leather, visits to your grandparents, cigars, burnt toast. Pours thick and black but with a creamy white head. Taste is sweet but roasty bitter but then herbal bitter but actually creamy milky sweet but really it's acrid and then toasty but sugary and then it's hoppy and it finishes roasty and bitter. The palate is simply enormous for 2.5% - thick and mallowy and smooth. It's incredible for this ABV. Baby black IPA? Mild IPA?","Luxembourg, LUXEMBOURG","andrew_drinks"
2500,"2014-04-23",3.7,"Bottle from Cotteridge Wines, Birmingham. Poured a murky dark brown with a big frothy light tan head and lots of broken lace. The aroma is grassy hop spice. The flavour is medium bitter with a nettle hop spicy pepper palate. Medium bodied with average carbonation and a short bitter finish. Didnt really get the ""milk"". More like a low-alcohol black IPA but a great beer all the same.","Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA","jmgreenuk"
2500,"2014-04-23",4.2,"Bloody lovely drink. And only 2.5% so you can drink loads of it. Fruity hoppy aroma. Very dark brown colour, nearly black. Fruity taste with a heavy hoppy lingering aftertaste.

2500,"2014-04-15",4.0,"Bottle from Beer Gonzo. It pours near black with a thick light tan head. The nose is fresh, piney, varnish, toast, milky coffee, light acidity and cocoa. The taste is bitter, pine, varnish, resin, roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, peppery, dirt and just a touch of lactose with a lingering bitter finish. Light+ body and moderate carbonation. Great flavour and bitterness for such a low abv beer. Very well done. Smashed back in record time!","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
2500,"2014-04-05",4.2,"Light chocolate malt aroma with sweet, slightly tropical hop notes coming through. A subtle burnt note as well. Very dark brown to black with a lasting Crème café head. A really burnt flavour alongside the new world hops make this is a ferocious delicious low alcohol beverage. To date (except right now) I have not come across a beer using lactose successfully but this one really has. A great idea to reuse those stout malts! Excellent brew","Bristol, Somerset, ENGLAND","leebotton"
2500,"2014-03-31",3.7,"(Bottle): Pours a dark brown. Aroma of mixed berries, dark fruit, sweet yet quite roasted malt. Flavour much of the same, has a really nice hop bite and a sweet, cream-like finish. Packs a bunch of flavour for the abv.","Merseyside, ENGLAND","Pizd"
