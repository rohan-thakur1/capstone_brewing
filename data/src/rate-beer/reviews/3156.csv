3156,"2017-05-18",4.3,"A 500ml bottle, bottled on 8th January 2016. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass. It was a cloudy raspberry red colour with a two finger off white head that had good retention and left nice sticky lacing. Aromas of red wine gum berry candy, vinous, oak, earthiness and a light funk. Tastes very lightly sour, raspberries, mixed berries, vinous, oak and slightly funky. Medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall I tend to enjoy these berry flavoured Wild Ales and this was no different.
