Hopefully, the remaining 3 brews, at higher ABV, have not lost their flavor. The bottle says best before end and is dated 08 07 17 and here we are at 05 29 17. This one didnt make it.

568,"2017-04-14",3.2,"This is a complex rather busy chestnut coloured beer; perhaps the 6.7 ABV accounts for the smallish head that quickly became a thin layer but stays the course. 
As I nose the beer there is the typical Belgian yeastiness, dark fruits and caramel perhaps a little herbal note. 
I raise the glass to find it's highly carbonated and fizzes in the mouth - it's a little thinner than I expected for a darker beer but medium smooth.
Yeast and fruit come in rapid succession with a spirited but not over bitter slightly herbal background (just about where I like it) that takes its time teasing the tongue. Then mellowing out to a balanced brown sugar and caramel aftertaste, but wait for it... when that's faded the herbal bitterness takes on a sharp metallic edge (remember boiled sweet acid drops?) and goes on and on and....","Nottinghamshire, ENGLAND","Onesimus"

568,"2016-09-02",4.5,"Cant believe I finally tried this, wow, well, ok, this was poured into a chalice.
The appearance was a ruddy dark brown color with a fingers worth of white to off white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Glossy filmy lacing clung and then slid into the glass nicely.
The aroma starts off with sweet iced apples, sly Belgian spices of allspice, ginger, and sweet cake to bready raison-like fruitiness. Comes together really damn good!
The flavor takes all of the previously mentioned flavors to meld in a nice refined sweet to spicy sort of way. Normal Belgian quickening throatiness doesnt harden on my throat in the aftertaste or finish like a fair amount of other Americanized- Belgian Dubbels.
On the palate, this one sits about a light to medium in body with a great sessionability about it. Carbonation rides light. ABV barely feels there.
Overall, love it for what it is, and would love to come back to this perhaps a bit later this Autumn. In my opinion, probably one of the best Belgian Dubbels on the market and we can get this in the USA. Everything just comes together so damn good!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

568,"2016-07-31",3.8,"330ml bottle bought at Good Stuff in Yuen Long.
Looks: Clear chestnut brown colour with a very thin trace of yeast particles; Two finger head with crumpety and creamy light-beige foam which lasts for 3 minutes; Beautiful sticky lacing with active small carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant and sweet dark malt, with strong caramel, strong sticky toffee, vanilla, plums, raisins, light chocolate, light cream, alcohol, icing sugar, brown sugar, dark bread, strong Bel yeast and thin grass. It gets pretty complex and pleasant when it gets warmer. Nice!

Taste: Mid to light sweet dark malt, with strong metallic, caramel, light toffee, light plums, light molasses, spices, very dry dark bread, Bel yeast, very light lemon, fair bitter hops and grass.

Body: Medium. Dry, very slick and creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Fairly solid dark malt in a pretty rich, smooth and metallic background, creamy all the way. Strong non-sweet caramel and toffee with light plums, notes of molasses then it gets pretty spicy, very dry rye bread yeastiness with light lemon to round. Some strong impression of English Ales dryness here. Very nice!

Hoppiness: Thin grass in nose. Spices, light lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness is light to moderate for a lasting, fairly astringent biscuity caramel malt finish. 

After Taste: Very dry. Bready and fairly bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one is well executed with good looks, complex caramel dark aroma, very dry bready and low-sweet taste with encompass lots of flavors in a conservative manner. Theres some good dry English characters in this 100% Belgian Dubbel. A beauty!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

568,"2014-09-22",3.5,"Bottle from the Bierzwerg webshop. Clear deep nut golden body verging on mahogany. Light brown, dense large head. Slow gusher. Wooden rock sugar, dates, raisins and band aid on the nose. Full bodied. Sweet furniture polish, oak, rubber, malts and bitterness to balance. High carbonation. Light astringent. Dry tongue. This beer works way better for me as I swirl out most of the carbonation. As it heats it becomes more malty, balanced and full flavored and a beer I would gladly drink again.","Mosterøy, NORWAY","abemorsten"
568,"2014-09-15",3.9,"Transfer from BA review on 6-15-13-

 Poured from bottle into a chalice glass

 Appearance- Pours an orange-copper color with a light haze and a small off white head. The head fades rather fast leaving only a light level of lace on the sides of the glass. 

 Smell- The aroma is of heaviest of a dark brown bread smell mixed with plenty of darker fruit aromas of prune, cherry and raisin. Along with these smells comes a light yeasty and caramel aroma as well.

 Taste- The taste begins with a bready and darker fruit flavor of raisin and prune. As the flavor advances some banana and yeast mixed with a bit of a caramel sweetness also enter the taste. The banana is joined by some other lighter fruits of apple and citrus as the flavor moves more toward the end lightening the taste slightly. At the end, some bitterness of a earthy hop flavor joins the taste leaving a nice somewhat crisper flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel-The body of the beer is on the average side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side as well. Both are appropriate for the style and act as a nice medium for the fruity and yeasty as well as lightly hoped and bready flavors of the brew.

 Overall- This brew is a quite tasty dubbel overall with a very nice flavor profile and a good drinking feel.","","Darkmagus82"

568,"2014-08-25",3.5,"Hazy, lovely mahogany pour. Golden raisin, young pine cone aroma. Hazelnut, chestnut, and bitter chocolate outline some malt nuances, and aluminum and iron introduce an extreme, crippling mineral weight.
Dry caramel, plum, and strawberry candy flavor; somewhat earthy, and full of esters with pear skin and flesh notes. Sandy notes of cardboard blend in with the caramel somewhat and are rather ignorable. Malt construction is sound, and the yeast contribution is classic. The depth is lacking.

Sugary mouthfeel, prickly and slick at the same time. This is an excellent example of the in-between nature of this style; sound and rounded in every way, while also thoroughly unable to leave an indelible impression.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Pours a slightly hazy dark brown due to the sediment that got into the glass with a half finger fluffy white head. Really good head retention and decent lacing.

Aroma is a little bit weak but I really can pick out brown sugar and vanilla. There is also a slightly musty odor but it is more complimentary than it is distracting.

The brown sugar is more muted in the flavor allowing the the banana/clove Belgian yeast character to shine through. More vanilla that is subdued but there is a noticeable lack of complexity compared to some other versions of the style. Mouthfeel is on the watery side with a little bit of stickyness left on the finish.

Id say the bitterness in this beer is a lot higher than is normal for this type of belgian beer, but then St. Bernardus lies smack in the middle of the Poperinge hop growing region, so why not?  The beer is lively in the mouth from typical belgian carbonation level, medium in body and with a long bitter aftertaste which gives taste of anise.

The aroma was of a toasted biscuit malt and a sweaty Belgian yeast with notes of caramel, toffee, banana and some dark fruit (plums and overripe grapes).

The taste had a strong malty presence and a mild sweetness with a hint of banana and caramel early on, and then slowly transformed into a much yeastier taste with a large dose of dark fruit and a mild toffee presence towards the end. The flavor lasted a good amount of time after the swallow with a sweet yeasty flavor and a mild fruity ester that was left to linger on the taste buds.

Mouthfeel was somewhere between light and medium in body with a creamy and a tad oily texture and a medium carbonation.

Overall an extremely tasty and very easy to drink Dubbel, and is a brew that hides all notion of somewhat moderate ABV...","Macon, North Carolina, USA","KajII"

568,"2012-05-10",3.3,"The first beer of my St Bernardus evening. I have a mixed four pack of 330ml bottles that I am drinking, reviewing three as I go (I have already reviewed the 12 some time ago).

This bottle is best before 15th Feb 2010, today is 1st March 2008. It was poured into my Westmalle bowl glass.

Looks wonderful at first, a deep clear redish brown with a full light biege foaming head. The head fell away just a bit to quickly for me, I like it to stay untila at least Ive had a sip or two.

Rich malty molasses fill your nose and a toffee, coffee sweetness comes through too.

The taste was a big let down for me, none of the flavours of the smell comes through into the actual beer. It is almost the blandest and tasteless dubbel I can remember having and I have had more than a few over the years.

It cant be discribed as watery, but it isnt a thick or viscous in any way either. A sourness comes into the mouthfeel as the beer warms in the mouth and I didnt like that either!

All in all a mixed start to my evening of tastings. I was expecting a lot more from this beer.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

568,"2012-03-13",3.4,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/30/2011.  Poured from a 11.2 oz. bottle into a my St. Bernardus Watou goblet.

My pour is a hazy faded caramel brown color with ruby edges. A fluffy eggshell cap leaves nice lacing down the sides of the glass.

The aroma is a bit soft. Caramel malt and cocoa are most noticeable, with spicy Belgian yeast and dark fruits in the background.

The flavor starts sweet and stays that way all the way through. Caramel malt brings out some cocoa, molasses, and brown bread in the malt. A fairly soft dark fruit presence of figs, dates, and raisins is gentle and fairly hard to distinguish. A bit of clove and other spices are present in the middle and leading to the end. The finish is clean, with a little spice and a soft sweetness.

The creamy carbonation never stops, it just keeps coming. The very intense carbonation scrubs away any residue after each sip and goes beyond creating a smooth feel. There is a light graininess noticeable after a few sips as well. The body drinks on the light side for the style.

The carbonation is really the X factor in this beer. The nose and flavor are nice and standard for the style, but the carbonation really explodes on the tongue. I think it takes a little bit away from the experience, but this is still a nice beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Stored at 39 degrees in my fridge until New Years Eve
Served at 48 degrees into a St. Bernardus Chalice
Label reads: 19/09/14
A - Deep amber color typical of a Dubel from Belgium. Two finger head was produced at the pour recommended on the side of the bottle. I tried to see through the ale but simply cant. Its not completely dark but its dark enough. A bit of sediment settled to the bottom.
S - Dry fruits hit the nose first followed by classic Belgian yeast smell which always makes me smile. The dry honey scent is so classic among these beers. I picked up some toffee or vanilla undertones.
T - A very surprising taste.There is a lot more carbonation than I expected and the beer is dryer than I assumed it would be based on the smell. The finish is like a dry champagne and the start has taste of figs and cigar smoke (the good kind)
M - Lively dry carbonation fills my mouth with one swish but not all of the beer bubbles up. Its still a medium bodied beer and, at 6.7%, thats not too surprising. Its a very tasty beer with a nice mouthfeel.
O - I wouldnt buy this again. The Bernardus 12 is still my favorite. This is a decent beer Id serve to friends while eating chips & salsa or some of my Trappist Pate served on crackers. Its a great belgian beer but not very memorable.""","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

568,"2011-07-30",3.7,"Details: 33cl on tap at Den Toogoloog.
Tasting: Dark brown color with a deep red shine and a decent medium size bubble beige head. The aroma has hints of nuts and proceeds to a sweet malty aroma with some slight fruity notes and is quite appetizing. The flavor is malty with a nice refreshing fruity flavor and a light bitter ending that has a slight amount of coffee in it that creates a gentle dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel is as soft as silk and the body is medium which together with the well balanced flavors make it very drinkable. I always like St. Bernardus on tap more then the regular 33cl bottle because I find the beer much more soft and balanced while still offering the same and even more flavor. This Pater 6 is no exception on that and I have no problem drinking this beer all night.

Bready malts, grassy hops with a touch of herbals, pepper, and a touch of sugars rounds it out. Not my favorite - on to the 8.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

Appearance: It has a dark burgundy colored body with a light haze and some yeast floaters. This is capped by a light beige head of frothy light foam. From the pour it left some yeast sediment on top of the head which looks like a dusting of cinnamon. The head hangs on well, slowly fading as I drink and making some nice lacing on the glass.

Smell: There are fruity and estery yeast notes of raisins and apple peel with a slight hint of spice and funk. This is all comes with a nice sweet bready maltiness as well.

Taste/Palate: Wow, this one has good complexity with fruity and spicy yeast, sweet bready and nutty malts. I get notes of cocoa powder blending with notes of walnuts and hazel nuts like Nutella within the sweet bready maltiness. Fruity notes remind me of raisins and as it warms I get some cherry as well. Hops are light and help to balance with mild bitterness and dryness in the finish. The palate has a solid medium body with mild carbonation.

Flavor is overwhelmingly malty on the front, transitioning to a deeper and slightly roasty dark-malt and yeast combo on the backside. The abbey yeast is very forward in this ale (about as much as any abbey Ive had), and the lower than normal alcohol for the style is noticable in the lack of the usual boozy and warming note dubbels normally exhibit.

The flavour is a lttle sweet up front but this is quickly replaced with a moderate bitterness towards the end. The finish is long and malty. On the palate, medium in body with a dry texture and lively carbonation. The finish is quite astringent. Overall, this is a reasonable dubbel, but nothing compared to the Prior 8.

568,"2010-05-15",4.1,"Bottle.

A - Rusted, crimson brown that is just a little cloudy somewhat tea color. Large rocky and foamy white head with decent retention that settles into a thick, creamy layer of lacing.

S - Very well spiced with some dark fruit (especially raisin) but it isnt heavy on the dark fruit, especially for a Dubbel. Healthy dose of candi sugar and molasses along with a touch of yeast aroma. Some nutty and sweet malt aroma. Pretty typical Dubbel aroma but a little less dark fruit and a little sweeter.

T - Similar to the nose with some light dark fruit flavors (raisin and a bit of fig) along with some golden fruit, specifically apple. Some sweet malt and candi sugar provide some sweetness in the background. Light nutty and cocoa presence in the background. Well spiced with a lot of clove and coriander with just a slight peppery and ginger taste.

M - On the lighter side of medium body with average carbonation. Smooth and creamy.

D - Very drinkable. Lighter Dubbel but still quite complex. Very smooth and easy to drink beer that is able to mix the stronger, complex flavors of a Dubbel, but still be light easy to drink.

Notes: Best before 24/09/12. Good lighter bodied and subtler Dubbel, but still full on flavor and complex. Not as dark or as much dark fruit as other stronger versions of the style, but they are still present and provide a lot of flavor. This is probably just as good as the Prior 8, just a bit different.

568,"2010-03-29",3.5,"From California to Belgium to Switzerland to Russia and beyond, real beer knows no boundaries. At the same time, beer styles also know no boundaries, but thats a quandary for another day and a subject of great debate. Today I am looking at the Pater 6 from St. Bernardus out of, where else, Belgium. Ah, St. Bernardus, how I love thee, let me count the ways


The lightest of St. Bernardus dark beers, the Pater 6 was a subtle hue of brown, mahogany, and amber polished to perfect brilliance. A fluffy cappuccino head slinks her way down into a fine collar while lace decorates her countenance. Life is sweet and so too is her nose, exuding a perfume of the finest dark fruits possible: plums, raisins, prunes, dates, and licorice root. Darkly sweet right from the start, she fades into crisp red apples, and pears, finishing with cinnamon sticks and toffee crunchies. A nip of lemon in the very end ensures my attentions while toast and wood offer a constant underpinning of support. Excellent. Diving right in, I savor her lightly effervescent and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Red apples, pears, plums, and prunes garner my favor first before maple, caramel, and brown sugars take me for a ride on the sweet train. These are the best kinds of sweet possible; dark, rich, moist and tantalizingly seductive. Children need not apply. Lemon zest cleanses and revitalizes after each quaff, calling me back for more. Crunchy toast takes her place in silent approval, allowing her compatriots to hog the spotlight of my affections. Thats ok though; I appreciate her self-sacrifice and loyalty. Cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, and paprika add spice and verve to each quaff while lingering long in my breath. Not overly complex and yet more than satisfying, she is crisp, crunchy, sweet, dry, and refreshing.


Very few Belgian breweries can claim to have previously brewed for the mystical Westvleteran monks, but St. Bernardus can. When Westvleteran chose to start brewing their beers themselves, that may very well have been the best tragedy that could have befallen the brewery. From that moment on, St. Bernardus brewed abbey style ales in their own tradition, and every time I sup one of their liquid treasures, I am reminded of how I am better for it.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

The flavor is medium-sweet with no detectable hops and just a touch of bitterness.   Lots of overripe and dried fruit, maybe a little squishy banana.   Creamy mouth-feel, and about medium consistency.   Finishes with some tendency toward dryness, but a slight sweetness caries through.   Just a little to one-note sweet dried fruit for me.

Pours dark brown with a surprisingly small bubbly head, much smaller than the massive thick head on the 8.  It recedes to a small cap with little lacing.

The aroma is sweet with candi sugar and Balgian yeast.  Plenty of fruity esters but with an interesting nutty character and some chocolate malts as well.

The taste has the sweet malts and dark fruits up front with a lightly toasted bready malt backbone.  Overall, its a sweet, malty taste with less spices than the 8.

The mouthfeel is fairly light with lots of carbonation.

This is a very good beer, though Id put it a notch below the Prior 8 as its not as complex and is a bit thinner in the body.  But, thats some pretty stiff competition and this is still better than most dubbels out there.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

With this one I was not really expecting anything great based on the other reviews and the style but I was pleasantly surprised. I really like this. It has a nice creamy head that, like many other belgians, seems to be alive. Pours a nice brown color.

Sampling Notes:
Served lightly chilled in chalice.
Bit of a gusher. Pours a biggish offwhite mess of dense foam atop a murky sort of coppy body.
Fruit cake sort of nose. Brown sugar, bready yeast, sweet cake, dried apricot and sultana. Bit of alcohol and grassiness in the background.
Smooth, creamy mouthfeel, carbonation is pretty low, medium bodied. Slight alcohol dryness on the finish.
Brown sugar-like malt body, hints of orange and dried fruit. Bread and cake, with a bit of grass on a dry and quite bitter finish.
Seemed a bit too easy to drink. Nice enough sort of Belgian pale ale, not overly complicated or strong, probably why it goes down so well.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Thin layer of bubbles kept me company the whole time. At the pour, the alcohol nose came through the most, as well as the flavor. Also, felt highly carbonated at the pour. The character really changed as it warmed. The fruityness was subdued, as a rich caramel like undertone emerged as it warmed. Also, the mouthfeel got less bubbly and more silky smooth.

568,"2007-06-24",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2007 The St. Bernardus Pater 6 is the youngest brother in the Bernardus family.  It is, like so many younger siblings through European history, a victim of primogeniture.  The 12 finds success in inheritance, land and lordship, while the Pater 6 must seek out a life of humility and ascetism in a monastery.  But that doesnt make it any less good.  It only makes it more difficult to realize its potential.  Besides, monks and clerics are generally more well regarded in history then the lords who, well, lorded over them.  The crown of the Pater 6 is very bubbly and porous, with an elderly silver white color that glistens in the light, while the body is the color of dark and dusty oak like an old chest or wardrobe stored in the attic.  Save for the vigorous streams of bubbles I might have thought this beer was sitting by itself for many years before I bought it.  The aroma is fresh like an outdoor vegetable stall, but with an assertive and semi-sweet creamy quality that lends it an appealing richness.  Wood, beef consommé, hops, dust and brown sugar are the most emphatic aroma components, designating the Pater 6 a moderately dry, flavorful and engaging beer.  Pink lady apple, candle wax and a mild hint of pear are the finer aromatic etchings, like a rococo detail, essential for the Pater 6s bouquet but comparatively minute.   Before I notice any distinct flavors Im struck by the Bernardus softness.  Its frothy, but thick like a great cushion, impacting with every sip.  I feel crude and churlish with every drink as if morphing this malleable treasure were somehow a desecration against art.  Yeast and yogurt, no doubt part of the creaminess, barge into the mouth with a welcome tanginess, while wood, dust, apple, pear, cinnamon, spring water and mandarin orange create a sophisticated sweet and cheesy palate.  I love this combination, and if I could define as its own category of beer, it would be my favorite style.  The Pater 6, concurrent with the toothsome flavors, is soft, light and entirely drinkable.  I find it a challenge not to devour it all in a single raise of the glass, but an impetus to savor it restrains me.    Indeed, this may be the little brother, cast aside for the big blue, but it has many merits of its own.  The Pater 6 knows what Augustine knows  being the marginal blue blood is of no consequence when it comes to greatness.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Poured this into its very own St. Bernardus goblet. The body poured a dirty brown. There were ruby highlights when held to the light but otherwise its opaque. The head was a random swirling on top and deeper along the sides of the goblet. Looks how some of the better Belgiums look. Somewhere inside of that murky body you just know you are going to get tons of flavor.

The first smell of this had my mouth instantly watering. There is so many different aromas coming from the glass. Dark fruits start it all off. Overripe plum and bing cherries. Something in there brings to mind brandy. Theres an underlying mustiness and even some mild cocoa powder. 

The flavor is tough to describe.The dark fruits come through nicely along with some candied fruit. The mustiness/earthiness is in the taste as well. Old cracked leather comes to mind but that probably has to do with the earthiness. About mid-palate you get a small heat from the alcohol that by the finish it shows itself perfectly. Very nice!

The mouthfeel is coating and slightly surprisingly a little thinner than I expected making it go down extremely easy. A small tingle on the back of my tongue. Slight alcohol fumes come through at the finish.

Drinability is very high for a beer of this type. There are a number of different flavors but they go together so well its easy going down. Im drinking this a little too fast but its hard not to. The moderate alcohol makes it easier to drink as well.

This is a very well made dubbel. Pick this up if you see it. I got this in their gift pack along with the 8, tripel, and 12. I was looking for a single or 750 of this the other day but didnt see any. I would love to find it in single bottles. An expertly crafted beer.","Illinois, USA","joe1510"

Slight alcohol at first taste, with dark fruits and caramel coming forward.  Slightly rasping, bitter finish with a bit of an off-putting flavor in the aftertaste.

568,"2007-04-20",3.3,"Sampled at a blind abbey dubbel tasting hosted by tennisjoel on 4-14-07, along with eight other beers. This was the eighth beer that we tasted. It finished in seventh place in my rankings, and it was seventh place in the group rankings. Originally poured from an 11.2 oz. bottle. The overwhelming winner of the night was t Smisje Dubbel, with Corsendonk Pater finishing a strong if distant second.

<P>Wheaty, slightly chocolatey aroma. Smells like a dunkelweizen. Good, appetizing aroma. Pours brown with a slight amber tint and a small amount of beige head. The flavor is a little dull. Hoppier and more bitter than most of the beers we tasted that night. I like that; I just wish that the taste was stronger. Bitter finish. Medium in body. Lively and frothy in the palate. Easy to drink.

<P>Yes, this beer is boring, but it is good nonetheless. It definitely got lost in the shuffle with the other eight beers in the tasting. If I had tasted St. Bernardus Pater 6 independently, I bet I would have rated it higher. I was not at all surprised  after the blind tasting when this beer was revealed to be the St. Bernardus, since its big brother Abt 12 is one of the most boring big beers that I have ever had. Pater 6 is actually better than Abt 12, believe it or not (in my opinion, of course).","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Generally, the Belgian Ales smell a bit fruitier, but have a fuller taste something that keeps your tongue guessing! Is it the beer I picked out? The St. Bernardus have not wowed me as I was expecting from having the Abt 12. The color is a red/brown with a simple head. Too carbonated, more like drinking a soda than a beer.

It poured a dark, dense burgundy, almost like liquid brown sugar with a thin ecru head.  The flavor was originally medicinal (it was too cold) but warmed into a very raisin flavor beverage.

The Pater is clearly in the same tradition as the other two: as soon as you pour it you will instantly recall the familiar and wonderful St. Bernardus aroma of hazelnutty chocolate.   The flavor is the same as the big brothers, just scaled down here.  Its fun to have another take on the classic St. Bernardus flavor, but its tough to feel other than that ther is something missing in this: it doesnt have that same remarkable balance of the Prior.  Nor does it really make the most of its smaller frame.  ITs like looking at a guy whose suit is a bit too big.

Sort of caramelly, but in a subtle way.  Very enjoyable, and although pricey, not unreasonably so.  In my opinion, this beer beats out a number of more expensive and rarer competitors.

Nothing wrong with it, but it doesnt have enough presence to score higher. 2001 bottle (I think - best before date was 31 December 2004, so it might have been a bit past its best) frombeersofeurope.co.uk.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

Taste is much like the nose. Spicy and a bit peppery or a gingery bite to it. Fruity apple flavors and grainy. Dryish too, which is odd. Some hops if the finish and aftertaste and a little thin in the mouth compared to the general flavor explosion. Really tasty and drinkable. Does the happy monk do anything wrong?

Taste: yum, more of the same nuts and cocoa from the nose, very tasty, like a mellow dubbel, or a more lofty brown ale. Delicious. And thats only the start of it...this is simple and complex at once, a very deceptive ale, almost light and unassuming, but ultimately stirring with character, the flavor getting livelier and more exceptional the further in we get.

568,"2005-01-19",3.3,"BB 2004 (2002 vintage?).  Medium brown colored body with a red glow to it and some deep orange tints.  Perched atop is a massive beige head that sticks around persistently.  The first notes I get are of a strong yeast, producing earthy, dusty notes, soil, metal, and damp leaves.  Some notes of raisins and cinnamon creep in, with a bit of caramel when the beer is swirled vigorously.  At first sip, it is not what I expected, begins loose and watery, with a brown sugar and plum-like flavor, some very light banana and clove notes and a touch of chocolate.  As the palate gets used to the medium-light body, a good belgian yeast washes over the palate and I cant say it disappoints.  Caramel, light walnuts and nutty, dry yeast seem to be the big flavors.  On the finish, there is more mashed walnut and brown sugar like flavor, with a chewy yeast sensation (I poured the sediment in to the last couple sips).  Some alcohol is evident, but with this light of a body and 6.7 percent alcohol, Im not completely surprised.  At the end of the glass, as I stick my nose in, there is a sharp, raw ethanol scent that is unsettling, but Ive finished the beer, so I dont mind terribly.  Lightly sweet notes of yeast, aluminum and dark candi sugar linger on.  Depending on how much I swirl the beer, I get different levels of carbonation.  It seems that without letting it breath and swirling off the carbonation, it is too much, but after it evens out, there is a much smoother if somewhat more obviously light body.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Aroma is very nice and soft with a somewhat crispy edge to it. Dark and dried cherry, banana, mixed berries, lemon waffer cookies dotted with powdered sugar and some touches of spicy yeast and phenols. Solid aroma and gets some interesting little hints and nuances as it warms, I keep thinking of a chocolate bread with cherries in it and those little lemon tea cookies as I continue to wiff it in.

Tastes are just as becoming as the wonderful display of aromas, soft and well rounded with the perfect carbonation that sits slightly dry quickly getting drier but never overly so with notes of the chocolate, berries, cherries, yeast, and lemon cookie crumbs. Quite a treat that remains smooth and inviting the whole way through. Complexing, subtle, and yummy. Super drinkable as it is beyond the threshold of any normal beer.

568,"2002-07-19",3.7,"Loaded with promise.  Gorgeous appearance--thick, fluffy head like a root beer float, on top of a pleasant dark brew, and the head persists for a good while.  Full marks for appearance.  Lovely aroma, too, lots of banana and a whiff of alcohol.  But the promise is not fully fulfilled in the tasting.  Slightly thin texture, relatively mild carbonation on the tongue, and a lack of flavor complexity.  Slightly improved as it warms.  Fine beer on the whole, but doesnt hold up against the very best Belgians, leaving me somewhat unenthralled.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

568,"2002-06-16",3.8,"Malty, herbal aroma. Hay. Rather sweet taste with citrus, liquorice, coffee and chocolate. Full bodied. Very nice abbey ale, warming and full of taste, in spite of its moderate alcohol content.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
568,"2002-04-29",3.8,"This is a very interesting beer. Ruby red-brown colour with a super large bubbled long lasting mid-beige head. The foam is quite strongly bitter but the aroma is wonderful. Floral, yellow apple, citrusy, malt and honey. The palate is a bit soft for my liking and probably its weakest point. Medium body slightly sweet /sour start, hoppy malty middle flavour and a medium strength shortish  bitter dry finish.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","OlJuntan64"

hassa taste sikilar to a rum soaked fruit cake.   lots of fruit with plum and banana flavors dominating. also hasa sweet sugary alcohol taste.
smooth chewy palate completes a great experience","Bombay, INDIA","ravidesai"
568,"2002-03-18",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2004 Big aromas of malt toffee and bananas (not quite 'liquid bread' more liquid banoffee). Good longlasting head with lots of lace and plenty of condition all the way to the end. More banana in the mouth balanced by malt, esters and a pleasant yeastiness. Aftertaste is dry with a salty bitterness and an alcoholic kick at the end. Got to use my St Bernadus glass for the first time in years!","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
568,"2002-01-16",3.3,"UPDATED: NOV 11, 2003 Irony aroma.  I also noticed aromas of cream, butter rum, caramel and cocoa.  Pours with a head with mixture of small and big bubbles (usually means low quality, IMO) and turns rocky with moderate retention atop a hazy, deep orange color.  Mouthfeel is a bit too hard and carbonated.  Swirled my glass a lot to release Carb.  Taste is almond butter, nutty, yet lacking complexities.  A well made and interesting beer, but not worth the trouble it takes to find it.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
568,"2001-12-03",3.9,"Not much aroma, hay, bit rust. Ruby colour with beautiful firm beige head. Very full, round, sweet, dark malt flavors. Finishes smooth but still a bit hoppy.","Delft, NETHERLANDS","jbrus"

568,"2001-09-25",2.4,"I dont know why I liked this beer - dirty brown colour, nice head, fruity nose (mango, banana), very malty and yeasty, too much carbonation, very sweet, heavy with a quite disgusting banana aftertaste","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"
