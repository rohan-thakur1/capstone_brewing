3436,"2016-12-27",4.5,"Un immense merci à Yan pour le partage de cette grande bouteille en ce souper de Réveillon! Vintage 2016. Entre lépaule dagneau braisée et les fromages. À peine la capsule levée de la bouteille, une véritable explosion darômes dérable envahit la pièce. Du sirop dérable, de la tire dérable sur la neige, de la pâte à biscuits aux pépites de chocolat non cuite... De la véritable folie! Une fois dans mon verre cependant, les arômes sestompent curieusement rapidement. De mon verre séchappent beaucoup plus de vapeurs dérable que du verre de Marc-André. Je ressens encore beaucoup de chocolat mais surtout du café. Une base cependant verte me fait sourciller car cette dernière était la dernière chose à laquelle je mattendais. Le café demeure tout de même au centre de toute laction - au nez comme ne bouche. Des arômes de grains de café éthiopiens chauffés accentués par des brisures de chocolat au lait de qualité exceptionnelle. Et cette texture!!! Le liquide est léger comme une plume, voire aérien. Une légèreté satinée, moelleuse comme je nen ai jamais ressentie de semblable. Lérable me salue en passant en guise de rappel en laissant le chocolat et le café se disputer le premier rôle. Laisse moi pas tout seul avec un bomber car je laurai bu sans même men rendre compte. Un élixir Supérieur.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

3436,"2016-05-27",5.0,"This beer definitely lives up to hype. All you need is some patience. Shared a whole bottle with my lady. 
The first few sips were disappointing. Very much coffee forward, could taste some yummy caramel malt, just a hint of maple and chocolate at the end, extremely sticky and thick mouthfeel. But did it deserve the title of ""one of the best imperial stouts"" in the world? Hell nah. 
But it gets better. Much better. As the beer warms up, maple and chocolate flavor becomes much more dominant. On the other hand, coffee flavor mellows out. The best part is that the flavor lasts on your tongue forever. Orgasm in my mouth. Perhaps the best beer Ive ever tasted.
For those who were disappointed, Im telling you, wait until this beer warms up! I chilled on this bottle for 3 hours, and the flavor just kept on getting better and better... cant wait to try Kentucky Brunch.","","Hugetaste42"

Pours an oily, black color, with a medium, dark brown head to it, revealing huge bubbles within a spongy head. Coates the side of the glass after swirling with alcohol legs, small bubbles and an oily film, showcasing the thickness of the beer.

Smells of warming syrup, wrapped up by cold pressed coffee beans, together with scorched, earthy malts. Atop of that foundation settles a nutty and raisiny quality, both adding to the potent coffee appearance. Milk chocolate enriches the luscious, sweet maple syrup, with coffee cutting through in a flowery, slightly wooden fashion. The most beautiful thing about the aromas is their perfect balance in combination to its outstanding intensity. 

Drinks outstandingly smooth, soft on the tongue with a lower carbonation to it, presenting the beers huge body perfectly. Even its profound coffee bitterness during the finish is not able to distract from its creamy softness, maintaining its fantastic thickness.

Tastes of oaken, multi layered espresso bean, pungent, while offering a pleasant, mellowing sweetness, which gets beautifully enhanced by the syrup. An early, dry coffee bitterness goes hand in hand with earthen, toasted malts and a brewed coffee sourness, almost completely wrapped up by the malts. Into this coffee sourness blends the rich maple syrup, creating an intriguing flavor depth, soothed by whipped cream. During the beers finish, its profound coffee earthiness returns to the palate, while bitter chocolate compliments it, together with perfumy, alcohol soaked praline.

While featuring chewy, sweeter qualities, the beer reveals an awesome balance, due to its mvp, the coffee. It is incredibly rich and exhibits both, sweeter and bitter qualities by itself, accentuated by syrup and malts. Its mouthfeel makes this truly great, maintaining a remarkable silkness on the tongue, while the beers rich, thick body is challenging the tastebuds throughout, in the most pleasant way, coating my tongue for minutes after each sip.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3436,"2015-10-05",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 10, 2016 bottle shared at the Moeder Lambic cellar session 2015. new bomber bottle from the latest release. poured one of the most dark oily black colours ive ever seen on a imperial stout, with a dark mocha coloured head that stays on forever. with some nice lacing on the side of the glass. while pouring the nose is hit with an incredible dark roasted espresso smell, followed by sweet dark roasted malts, sticky syrup. toasted almonds, sweet bakers chocolate, mocha. really just smells like a morning breakfast pancake covered with dark coffee maple. the smell is just a clear 10 out of 10. however the taste can not follow the nose. there is still that dark chocolate coffe roast, with vanilla, and maple syrup, and maybe a bit overpowered by the coffee. but there is missing something. the mouthfeel is thick and viscious. and the look keeps amazing untill the last sip. glad i finally got to try this one","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"

3436,"2015-09-02",4.9,"Yesterday at the 2015 release.

L: Very dark, no light gets through this one. As the beer moves around the glass, it coats and sticks to the side, pretty sure my chalice is permanently brown. Thin caramely head with good retention.

S: Huge maple and coffee nose. The entire taproom smelled like brunch during the release. Most aromatic beer I have had.

T: Maple not as big as nose would suggest, but still huge and controlling. The roasty coffee comes through amazingly as well, chocolately roasty, not bitter roasty. The beer is extremely smooth, would not guess it is a 12% stout.

MF: Amazing. Absolutely perfect viscosity/thick feel for a non BA stout.

The pour is a viscous and tar-like black with a thin dark brown head that settles to a small ring and offers some great staining on the glass. The aroma is all coffee up front and absolutely beautiful. There is a great complexity of maple, a little bit of green oak and vanilla. A fudgy chocolate backs everything up. It smells like a fudge. The taste is unbelievable. Heavy coffee, that unbelievable maple, a great chocolate, moderate vanilla, and a light bourbon presence. This baby tastes like a maple-soaked coffee fudge. My god. The mouth feel is unbelievable. Its like chewing fudge. Thick, viscous, with a soft carbonation. This baby just coats the mouth and refuses to leave. The aftertaste is all maple.

The aroma is super sweet, chocolaty, vanilla and booze forward, with a good bit of coffee to it as well. Im not really doing it justice there, but its just impossibly rich smelling, inviting, brooding... etc. 

The flavor is rich & sweet, generally huge with a bunch of dark chocolate & coffee. It seems a bit odd, but I swear I got a touch of like a floral bitterness to it too, Im not sure what thats about,, but it was nice enough either way and provided not so much a balance, but a curious pleasant note that took the beer in a slightly less brooding direction.

SO VERY THANKFUL that this is not just a nose full of coffee beans and nothing else...Ahem, back to the beer, dark chocolate, dry vanilla and liquorous raisins. Hop notes are light, add some mild citrus notes but otherwise give the stout over to the malt. Very strong aroma and no sign of alcohol or any flaws.Departing again from the recent trend of stouts that you have to chew before swallowing, this stuff is actually only medium-full bodied. Carbonation is very tight and gives the beer a very engaging texture that wraps about the mouth spreading light prunes, bitter dark chocolate notes, sweet vanilla and moderate amounts of coffee flavor. Sweetness is on the low side and its not just a mouth full of sugary chocolate. On the finish there is a delicious, difficult to describe flavor, almost bourbon-like, or maple liqueur-like, though not as sweet as maple liqueur.

There is a nice pancake-batter middle ground here...or maybe the maple syrup is drawing me in that direction...but the chewy body gives the palate that impression.

Ridiculous espresso, fudge, brownies, maple syrup, Nutella, doughy, and vanilla. No joke when people say its like maple syrup covered pancakes. Pours super thick black with absolutely no light shining through and a faint brown lace on the side of the glass. Taste is surprisingly less sweet for a beer that commands this kind of aroma. The coffee works damn well with the fudge and maple syrup to cut out the sweetness. Nice espresso, mocha, brown sugar, coffee bean, roast and finally the maple, vanilla, molasses and milk chocolate. Body is crazy thick with low carbonation. The syrupy mouth isnt really distracting, but it definitely does leave a sticky feeling on the tongue. The finish is just non-stop fudge and maple with mocha/coffee hanging out on the tongue for days. Overall perhaps the best non-BA stout.

The coffee cuts out any sweetness from the maple syrup that might be detracting. This is stunningly amazing. One of the best impie stouts out there.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

Looks like a beer I would have loved in my stout phase three years ago. Nose has tons of dark roast coffee, roasty malt, pancakes (!), chocolate, and a good deal of maple. How did they do this? Taste is more dark roast, chocolate chip pancakes, and a big maple finish. Wow. I was a bit skeptical, and this isnt my favorite style anymore, but man is this good. The 12% is nowhere to be found, and its surprisingly easy drinking. Its sweet, but not in a cloying way.

The taste is big and bold and smooth too, matching up perfectly with the welcoming aroma and the dollop dropping body. Flavors inlcude milk chocolate, coffee, well-incorporated maple syrup sweetness and just some toffee. Theres something additional here too, a doughy cookie batter chewiness, that sets it apart from other stouts that have those traditional coffee-milk-chocolate aspects. Rich and smooth in body, motor oil heavy and moderately carbonated. Overall, this was my favorite stout at the 2013 Great Taste. This stuff is worth seeking out.","Illinois, USA","brian60625"

The taste is again ridiculously huge with maple syrup and coffee. Flavors really meld together well. Not very complex at all, but avoids any char taste, and very enjoyable. Thick, smooth, extremely long finish. A common complaint about beers I have is that they are one dimensional. I cant say that in this case, but I would say that it does lack complexity and is ""two dimensional"". That having been said, I did really enjoy this, and for a sweet dessert beer in small quantities it is great.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"
3436,"2013-08-18",3.6,"(bottle shared at the RBSG brunch) Pours jet black with a dark tan head that quickly settles to a thin ring around the glass. Aroma is very potent, and the maple syrup really dominates proceedings, and it serves to mask the coffee component underneath, which improves the beer as I can smell some vegetal snap pea and green bell scents emanating from the coffee undertone. With more air, some sweeter scents of Reeses peanut butter cups, walnuts, and raisins make their presence known, which does improve things. The flavor also heavily emphasizes the maple syrup, and along with that is an abundant amount of chocolate, peanut butter cup, and roasted malt. Very sweet. The coffee again is pretty suppressed by the sweeter flavors but some ash and greenness is evident towards the finish, although its not nearly as glaring as it is in the aroma. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is appropriate.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
3436,"2013-08-18",4.6,"Bottle. Wow, what a treat. Clark was kind enough to bring some bottles from his private stash to the RBSG brunch event at the Republic.

The aroma is just fantastic with notes of maple right off the bat, molassess, some dark chocolate, and roast. Heavy mouthfeel, chewy. As in the aroma, the flavor starts off with a sweet maple syrup note which transitions to a dark coffee note at the end. It literlly is like eating and maple pancake and then taking a big drink of your fresh brewed coffee. I will say that this beer is fairly sweet though, I could probably slolwy drink a whole bottle over the sourse of an hour or so but for this occassion 4-6oz was perfect.

Such a huge banana desert component to this I could compare it to just about any sweet cream + banana combination. Bananas foster? Sure. Banana split? Why not. Big sweet creamy bananas. Not a bad thing really, but this beer is sticky sweet. Carbonation is dialed in perfect for the style. For a desert beer, this is well above average.

Pretzels, great rich flavors. Some more coffee elements. Smell is on, beer is good. 
Edit: On tap at the 2013 Assassin Release. This beer is still rich, powerful, and potent. Full bodied, rich maple and coffee flavors, cool vanilla and some good roast, cocoa, and all around assertive flavors. Sipped on glasses of this that I shared all day. It would be hard to drink more than a glass or two, but on and off throughout the day it really worked. I really enjoyed this and upped the score overall by one. The nose was still on and powerful, the flavors just great and overall, just a lovely experience. Cant wait till the next release.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3436,"2012-08-12",5.0,"GTMW.  Deepest of black pour.  Aroma is completely overwhelming.  Straight, permeating, thick fresh roasted coffee.  I cannot understate this.  Perfectly lets out little pockets of sweet maple syrup.  Flavor is the real deal.  Again, huge, huge fresh coffee flavor.  Very earthy.  Sweet sticky maple syrup, roasted malt, and brown sugar.  Coffee and light maple sweetness lingers and lingers.  No real acidity from the coffee.  Semi-gritty and chewy, but in the best possible way.  Thick on the palate.  Sweet enough to be enticing, but not sweet enough to be detracting.  Unbelievably good.  This is my perfect beer.  Period.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
3436,"2012-08-10",4.4,"5 oz pour at Dexters Pub, pre-GTMW. Oily, viscous black pour with dark espresso-colored head. Okay lacing, thick ribbons of alcohol legs. Huge maple syrup on the nose, also big on the coffee, barrel notes, and brown sugar. Super, super sweet: more maple syrup, molasses, fresh black coffee, some rich chocolate in there as well. I imagine this is what CBS sort of tastes like. Either way, a really excellent beer, if cloyingly sweet.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","jlruthven"
3436,"2012-08-10",4.5,"Jet black pour tiny brown head legs and lace.  I would guess a touch of bourbon a bunch of maple syrup a hint of coffee and some extra sugar.  Fuel well coated palate.  Almost a touch of bacon in the swallow with tons of maple syrup a hit of coffee.  Nearly perfect but a touch to sweet.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
3436,"2012-04-22",4.8,"On tap into a tulip shaped glass.  Coffee, maple syrup, vanilla aromas, and taste.  Very black, with minimal lacing, and a one-finger head.  Decent carbonation.  It was not astringent either, and the 12.8% ABV was very well hidden.  I would drink as much of this as possible as often as I could.  To bad the brewery is two hours away though.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","Cedar Rapids, Iowa, USA","MAFountain"
3436,"2012-01-08",4.4,"On tap at TG.  Massive espresso nose, probably the nicest coffee aroma Ive come across, like sticking your nose in a bag of freshly roasted oily coffee beans.  Also some caramel in the aroma, chocolate, malty sweetness, fantastic.  Pours an opaque inky black, brown head with good retention, leaves some lacing and coats the glass.  Flavor is very tasty coffee, smooth with no astringency, chocolate and hints of maple syrup and vanilla, roasty, more espresso, fairly sweet.  Very full body, medium carbonation, very smooth and creamy, coats the palate.  Coffee flavors and aromas in this beer are amazing, well done.","Iowa, USA","ekoerper"
3436,"2011-08-17",4.5,"On tap at GTMW.  Poured oily black with no head and heavy viscosity.  The aroma picked up sweet Aunt Jemima over a fine blend of dark malts.. decadent, and I really wanted it over pancakes.  The flavor found sweet maple, vanilla, and more pancake syrup over coffee and roasty black patent maltage.. more bitter toward the back, with rising coffee roast.. just delicious!  Syrupy, heavy, and coating on the palate.. sweet.. this struck the right chords with me!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
