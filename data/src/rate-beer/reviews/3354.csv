Have never understood what all the rage is about Societe. Have reviewed two and probably tasted/had about five or six others. Hoping this one will change my opinion. 

Kind of hard to see in the place, but poured a golden, clear color with 2-to-3 fingers of fluffy, off-white head when I got it. Very good spiderweb foamy lacing. Very good retention. Just a nice looking beer. (Sight - 4.50)

Smelled spicy Simcoe, smooth Mosaic, tropical hops, mango, tobacco juice, pine, tangerine, pineapple and mint. (Smell - 3.75)

Taste followed the nose, getting spicy Simcoe, grassy herbal hops, pine, tropical notes, tangerine, bitter mango, Mosaic and pineapple. (Taste - 3.75)

Light body. Oily texture. Lively carbonation. Abruit finish. (Feel - 4.00)

Decent session IPA. Id have it again, but nothing to extraordinary for the style. The saga continues for me with Societe. (Overall - 3.75)

3354,"2016-03-30",3.7,"Pint poured at societe brewery. Pours clear golden with white head. The aroma is crazy! Smells like a tropical forest (grapefruit, pineapple, oranges). The taste was not what I was expecting, given all the hoppy citrusy beers Ive had lately. Pretty tame with a watery slightly grapefruit or
Mango finish. Its good but not what I thought Id be getting.","Strathmore, Alberta, CANADA","ryanhunter_4"

3354,"2016-02-21",4.2,"(En fût à la brasserie): Larôme ne ment pas, définitivement du Mosaic ou un quelquonque cousin combiné à un houblon plus collant et porté sur lamoniac comme le Simcoe. Superbe intensité darôme. Le corps nest pas mince et très céréalier même avec une bonne ligne verte tout le long. Très survoltant pour la taille du liquide.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
3354,"2016-02-18",3.8,"On tap @ The Hop Grenade. Hazed and pale golden beer with a white head. Overwhelming citrus aroma of orange and grapefruit. Really intense and juicy. Maybe even a touch tropical. Flavor somehow lacks the punch, but is still nice. Fairly bitter, which I wasnt expecting, but some nice toasted biscuit malt. Moderate citrus zest and a hint of peach. Not as flavorful as it is aromatic, but still a nice offering.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

Aroma is wonderful, tropical, fruity, notes of dank pot and pine. Room filling. Flavor is a bit of a disappointment after that amazing flavor, nothing wrong per se, just a severely muted version of the aromatics, tropical and clean with an underlying herbal pot note.
