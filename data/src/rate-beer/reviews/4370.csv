4370,"2016-07-26",3.7,"Deep black little head. But great bottle and label. Rich decadent dark chocolate throughout. A touch heavy on the hot spices detracts from it being the perfect dessert beer","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","bozoNZ"
4370,"2016-07-16",4.3,"Tasting flight at garage project. Matched chilli and lime bar. Huge nose full of malts and a subtle tequila aroma. The beer goes from stout flavours to tequila back to stout then tequila again and finishes on stout. What an exceptional Rollercoaster of flavour.","Palmerston North, NEW ZEALAND","Samtzu"
4370,"2016-05-29",4.0,"Thanks Ryan. Pours much darker then I would have thought, very dark brown. The aroma is chocolate, chili pepper. The flavor is fruity, chocolate, chili. Warming alcohol. Very tasty.","Bountiful, Utah, USA","Gription79"
4370,"2016-02-07",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Heavy on the chocolate, this dessert-like creation finds complexity in its just use of hot peppers, alcohol heat and agave fruitiness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the brown-edged black.
-The mouthfeel is quite rich, but these chocolatey sugars are very pleasant.
-This will probably age very well.
-What a bottle/label design! Wow!

4370,"2015-10-31",3.7,"Huge chocolate licorice aroma in a black pour. Similarly huge taste of cocoa, licorice, and vanilla balances the unmistakable strength. The sustained strong finish leaves one thinking this brew would be best ending a session.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
4370,"2015-10-24",4.6,"Pours jet black with a minimal head that disappears quickly. Intense aromas of black coffee, chocolate, smoke and tequila. Incredible taste - sweet, sour and umami; coffee and dark chocolate with hints of chilli, vanilla and tequila. Rich mouth feel, chilli, chocolate and smoke lingering in the after taste. A really unusual beer, but incredibly well structured and will appeal to those who like smoked porters and whisky.","HONG KONG","hkkiwi"
4370,"2015-10-05",4.2,"BOTTLE. Poured jet black with a coffee/tan head that didnt last long, a slick oily look.. Nose seemed to be the tequila barrel, a touch of molasses and malt.. Heaps going on in the mouth, the chilli provided a warm touch that masked the ABV, Chocolate, some vanilla, malts, a touch sticky at the back end with the tequila barrel.. Worth the wait..

4370,"2014-07-09",4.5,"Pours black with a slowly building tan head.
Loads of chocolate, some woody tequila, smoked chilli, heavy roasted malt and chocolate fudge.
More tequila as a flavour along with smoky chilli, a bit of booze and loads of roasted malt.
Nice warming heat from the chilli and the booze.
Pretty bloody amazing stuff.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Davros"
