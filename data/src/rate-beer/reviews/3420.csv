3420,"2016-09-09",4.0,"Pours nice amber-copper, no carbonation but really looking as I would expect oude bruin to look like. Aroma is sour but not just so. I am getting strawberries, bit of sweet cocoa or milk chocolate, lots of berries. Taste is nicely tart, tannic, not overly acidic but nicely so, red currants, tart lime cake. Layer of sourness coats my mouth from inside, leaves a nice funky tannic linger lurking around for ages. Lots of flavours, much more than I usually get from this style. Top level stuff, really enjoying this.","ESTONIA","jinroh"

>> Murkier half dreg pour from the bar, muddy brown with thicker than expected cream foam with good lacing and retention. Big funky and rich fruity nose of baked cranberry and cherry pie. Taste is more sour than the Flanders Red with ridiculous spicy oak and sour, leathery nectarine skin. Long leathery finish with high acid. Slight grape skin tannic and cranberry bite. Seems overall to be more lemon citric and one note. Enjoyed the Flanders red more. Would like to see how it develops in the bottle over time.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
