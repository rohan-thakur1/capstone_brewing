Comments: Huge stunning mountainous head. Grainy, well toasted, mild coffee-like, chocolate icing reminiscent, profound beer that, as Jamtlands always does, goes beyond stylistics definition. Sweet and dry, sweet and dry, its a switch. Medium vanilla undertones all along. No sourness. Very full-bodied. Complex and hugely drinkable.
