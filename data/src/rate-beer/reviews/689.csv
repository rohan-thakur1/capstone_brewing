689,"2017-06-11",3.5,"355 ml. can @ Home.
Aroma: quite intense aromas of plums, raisins, prunes, dark dried fruits. Hints of alcohol, roasted and toasted malts, burnt caramel.
Appearance: deep brown-reddish color with super creamy light brown head with medium to high thickness. Foam made of tiny-to-small bubbles. Quite dark but it seems pretty clear. High retention. Low to medium Brussels lacing.
Taste: medium to high sweetness, low bitterness, no sourness. Flavors of dark dried fruits, raisins, prunes, plums. Hints of figs. Very subtle chocolate, nuts and maybe coffee overtones. The warming effect from the quite high level content is noticeable. Balance is much toward the sweet side.
Palate: light to medium body, oily-silky texture, very low carbonation, quite sweet and lingering finish of dark dried fruits, raisins, prunes, plums. The flavor is moving to some bitterness as it lingers. Hints of toasted and roasted malts, burnt caramel.
Overall: quite good appearance, aromas and flavors. This beer is all about dark dried fruits, plums, prunes and raisins. Very pleasant flavors and aromas. Quite good. It would better with a bit less of alcohol and less sweetness (too much sweetness for me, but its ok for the style).","Pontevedra, SPAIN","GoddamnNoise"

Very readily available round these parts, maybe its the cheap flights to Denver, or the abundant reasons to travel between the vastly different yet intertwined cities. A river floating classic, I still remember one, warming at bottom of nearly empty cooler, scratched and shaken, too much for the situation needed dilution with Guadalupe River, flattening the craft, memorable, but not quite the ideal situation for this interpretation of an ale from a land perhaps similarly caught in the current, dragging it downstream helplessly away from its place. Smells a bit like wood varnished in decades of smokiness and boisterousness which somehow twisted wee from an imperial shit ton by most other standards. Balanced somehow on three axes  extra sweet malt fattened with roastiness, stand up hops leaning against wobbly alcohol at a tingly convergence; similar to way burly enough men playing ridiculous looking musical instruments in skirts somehow works.

689,"2015-11-10",3.7,"Oskar Bluess take on the old wee heavy, from a craft beer can. Thick but coarse, moussy, pale yellowish beige head, opening in the middle but retaining well on the edges, over a clear, deep red burgundy coloured beer, dark but still translucent with yellowish chestnut brown edges, as it ought to be in this style. Aroma of caramel cake, some FFF (freshly fermented farmland), medlar, red cabbage with brown sugar, sweet chestnut, candied dates, hints of cola, milk chocolate, forest floor, kahlua, biscuit, sweet cherry chocolates (stronger in warming up), pear syrup, hazelnut oil. Soft sweet onset, candied dates, pear and raisins, deep sourish touch, soft carbo, smooth and lightly oily, full mouthfeel, very caramelly and gently nutty with brown sugar sweetness on top but a toasted bitterish accent as well, deep leafy and spicy hops in the finish but playing their role as backing vocals as is typical for the style, along with a dash of warming, bit rhum-like alcohol; bittersweet maltiness lingers, but more sweet than bitter. The aroma is very Scotch indeed but also bears certain resemblances with Belgian dubbel and quadrupel, though the yeast profile is clearly clean enough to pass for an Anglo-Saxon style ale - and therefore a Scotch in the true sense, though it could use just a tad more roasted maltiness in order to be truly great in its style. Still, certainly enjoyable on a gloomy autumn evening, and with high drinkability for a beer of this ABV too - a bit treacherous as such...  Solid.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

PALATE: a mad, strong pull at the throat leaves the teeth slightly buzzing; the carbonation is thick and vibrant, while certain moments are flat and dry--indeed, a complex, warming experience... TASTE: a sweet, chocolaty draw accompanies the thick, smoky sensation that makes this beer a dessert in itself...the roasted malts elbow out any chance for hop flavors, try as I might to discern them...as sippable an 8% ABV as one can find, with little residual heat and much to savor; the sweetness of caramel and toffee wed harmoniously...OVERALL: true to its promise, this beer is a celebration of malts in all their glory--toasted, roasted, chocolaty, with caramel, toffee, and the backbone of a loch ness monster that upholds all of the intensity...in a a can, no less...","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"

This one was another excellent beer from Oskar Blues, it was definitely a lot more hoppy than I had been expecting & there was a huge amount of sweetness in there too but the two seemed to work well together & the balance was a good one.

Same with Ten Fedy, the chemical reaction created by using convenient aluminum cans could be responsible for the same hint of Ivory bar soap throughout the experience. A brown glass bottle old school option needs to be available. Other than that significant issue, Old Chub is underweight & is lacking ABV to my liking...I consider Old Chub the Miller Lite of Scottish Ales. Nothing unique here.  No wonder it comes in 6-pack cans for lesser a price than Ten Fedy 4-packs which isnt much better comparatively.

Appearance: Pours a deep hickory brown, and forms a massive tan head with both good retention and crazy lacing as it slowly recedes.

Smell: Toffee and caramel malts, and more than a hint of something floral.

Taste: And yep, thatd be what I imagine floral perfume tastes like. Faintly, under the barrage of rancid garbage runoff - sorry, I mean hops, its just reflex to type the other thing - theres something that vaguely resembles toffee and chocolate malt.

The murmur of scotch in the undertones of the flavor is a perfect addition, not overwhelming or boozy at all, just like a good oak quality that would complement a really good cigar.

689,"2014-11-07",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 26, 2015 Scotch ales are hit and miss, lets see how this highly rated one stacks up. Smells good - malty, smoky with a hint of booze and a slight woodsy scent. Looks great, like cola with an off-white large head of foam. Tastes like blended scotch, with the smoked beechwood malts really showing off here. Many lesser scotch ales are just plain malt sweetness but this one has a lot more going on. You can taste some of the alcohol and it has a slight burn, both of which are appropriate for this style. Substantial palate, overall very good. When it comes to best scotch ale Ive ever had, it is now a toss up between this one and Founders Dirty Bastard.

689,"2014-09-19",2.9,"UPDATED: SEP 20, 2014 Very dark beer almost as dark as a Guinness. It is almost the color of a chocolate stout. Tastes as smooth and silky as iced coffee with a nice after taste. This beer gets better with every sip so that by the end of the pint you find yourself craving another. The only downside of this beer is the heaviness factor but it lends itself to slowly enjoying this beer. 

In closing, my rating of this beer is very much based on my newness of stouts and chocolate ales. I am trying to branch out to more non ipa beers and this is my first attempt. Its probably a better beer than I am giving it credit for and this rating is solely a matter of preference.

689,"2014-06-20",3.9,"Transfer from BA review from 6-20-12- 
Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance  Served a medium brown color with only a tiny off white head. The head faded fast to leave only a small amount of lacing.

Smell  A very sweet and malty aroma greet the nose. The malt is of a light roasted nature  very brown bread, with the sweet being a mix of darker fruit and some caramel.

Taste  Just as the nose forbade, this beer is sweet and malty. It begins with a good dose of brown bread mixed with some dark fruit (mainly fig in nature). Soon after however, other sweeter flavors of cherry mix in with the bread and fig. As time advances more of a light boozy and lightly hoppy flavor mix into the rest, leaving a very satisfying aftertaste on the tongue.

Mouthfeel The beer has a higher than average thickness in body with the carbonation level being on the lower side. Both the thickness and the lower carbonation accentuate the malty and sweeter flavors of the beer and really allow them to be experienced on the tongue.

Overall  One fantastic and pretty easy drinking beer. It has a nice smooth flavor yet still is able to pack a punch.","","Darkmagus82"

While Dales Pale Ale (""the best-tasting canned beer Ive ever had,"" according to many brewers and beer experts) is a showcase of both hops and pale malts, Old Chub is a celebration of malts. The cola-colored beer features a dense, tawny head, a creamy mouthful and flavors of caramel, chocolate and lightly roasted malt. Complex and rich, it finishes with a whisper of smokiness that calls to mind a fine single malt scotch. Old Chub weighs in at 8 % alcohol by volume.","Denver, Colorado, USA","thehurt01"

A: Pours a dark brown ale with a single finger of fine foam which falls to a central cap of the same. No lacing. Excellent clarity reveals ruby hues.

S: Yummy caramels, ruddy grains. Vanilla, cream, hints of earthy hops. Good nose. A bit sweeter than I can appreciate, but good nonetheless.

T: So, I took a drink. Then another. Then another! This has fantastic malt profiles - caramel, toasted grains. Really nice flavors. Im not particularly articulate this morning, but this is great.

M: Medium to heavy body with moderate carb - great for the style. Slightly drying.

O: Im very impressed with this beer. Ive been weary of it for a few years, as I had it back a few years, and it was not my ticket, but this is really good. Oh, how the palate changes.

Slightly overbitter for style. Medium palate, thin spitty texture, ""flaccid"". The description is fairly accurate, yet (speaking as a homebrewer, why is OB taking shortcuts? it seriously fucks up the beer) highlights so many flaws in execution; ""copious amounts"" of crystal/caramel are neither necessary nor appropriate, and chocolate and/or smoked malts are just plain wrong. That explains a lot of the flavor and aroma flaws. A simple grist, high gravity wort, pitch lots of Scottish yeast, ferment cool, booyah: Scotch Ale. Duh, its not a hard style to brew.

689,"2013-09-20",3.9,"I poured a 12oz can into a mug. It was canned on 5/29/13 and cost $2.75 ($0.23 per ounce).

Appearance: Deep ruby red to brown/mahogany/chestnut hue. Translucent. Forms a small, tan, foamy head which mostly evaporates and leaves trace lacing on the glass.

Smell: Sweet confectionery aromas of toffee and butterscotch. A strong peat or mossy character as well.

Taste: Im not usually a big fan of Scotch Ales because they tend to be too intense. A lot of breweries like to go heavy on the smoke, and not strong enough with everything else. Oskar Blues Old Chub is the exact opposite since the malty sweetness is clearly the star of the show here, but with enough peaty/smoky rusticness to give it that classic Scotch Ale taste.

The base flavor is not all that far from a doppelbock, actually. As soon as it hits the tongue I taste chocolate, toffee and butterscotch - but theyre all well-restrained, not sickly sweet. Its also a completely authentic taste - nothing artificial here. Theres a noticeable hop bitterness at the crest of the swig, though its fairly well restrained and makes a great transition to the smoky/earthy finish. Its well balanced with the rest of the palette so as not to be distracting or overwhelming (smoke in beer is best used sparingly). Theres some chocolate and coffee on the aftertaste, and while drying, it is not annoying. This beer is definitely a maltheads delight.

Drinkability: The first thing I noticed about Oskar Blues Old Chub was how smooth and comfortable it was. Its thick with a smooth, almost creamy texture not unlike a strong stout. Its a beer that actually feels good to drink because of its delivery and not just its taste. At 8% ABV its technically a big brew, but theres no alcohol presence, nor is the body intense or abrasive. Its tempting to drink this in large quantities, though one serving is satisfying.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

A small head of beige foam that fell fast and leaves fine wet lace that falls very fast. Thin ring. Head refreshes slightly upon a tilt of the glass. Nose is toasted malt, deep toffee, brown sugar, cherry and earthy with a touch of alcohol. No hops on the nose at all. Taste is smooth and a little buttery, slightly thick and sticky. It travels the palate slowly and the malt is dark and toffee like. Leaves a faint trace of hop bitter on the mid palate but finishes cloying with a coating of sugar sweetness on the back palate. Has a roasty, dry, earthy peat quality overall but I wish there was more of that. Carbonation is small bubbles that keep the palate bright but it still drinks very heavy.

689,"2013-04-19",3.7,"This is my favorite style.  I dont think enough brewers make a good version of this.  But Old Chub is pretty good I must say.  Picked up a six pack of cans for $10.  Not a bad price.  The beer itself is very good. At the risk of sounding ridiculous, I will say that this is my 4th favorite scotch ale.  Its not even close to Backwoods Bastard, but its only a notch below Scotty Karate and Dirty Bastard.  This is now on my go to list of Scotch Ales, and whether I purchase one vs another will be based probably on price and availability.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","Holtguy"

689,"2013-03-20",4.1,"3/06/12 ""Mornin Chub"" poured into a Samuel Adams ""Perfect Pint"" glass. This one was apparently brewed in Brevard, North Carolina, and not Longmont, Colorado.

Appearance: Crystal clear, ruby black. If seen in low light, it appears to just be black. About a finger or two worth of a light brown head. The lacing on this one is lovely -- doesnt last to the bottom, but it looks nice at the top.

Smell: Malts, dark fruits, metallic notes (could be from my just-rinsed-out glass, though... wouldnt doubt it).

Taste/feel: A LOT of sweet, dark fruits throughout, with surprisingly low bitterness. The end of the sip is a bit more malty, with the scotch seeming to join the party. Its 8%, but you dont really get it. Theres a bit of warmth there, but the alcohol (in my opinion) cant be tasted at all on the front. Really smooth, and easy drinking. Aftertaste gives traces of the alcohol with a good bit of raisin-like tastes. Thick, but not too much so.

Oskar Blues hasnt failed me yet. Old Chub is a great beer. Not much like Founders Dirty Bastard at all, if youve had that ... I find that Dirty Bastard is more caramel-y. Old Chub is a lot of sweet, dark fruits, and some roasty bitterness near the end. Really a great beer.

689,"2012-12-27",4.2,"Reviewed 11/24/2012. 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.

A: Pours a very dark burgundy color with a fair amount of light coming through the body. Nice head on this one, a one finger light mocha shade with nice texturing and retention. The lacing left is plentiful, as well.

S: Ive had trouble identifying leather in a beers aroma before - but this is the first beer Ive had thats truly leathery in its scent. Beneath that lies some sweet caramel, dried dark fruits, and a subtle touches of smoke and green tea.

T: Has a nice opening sweetness to it, almost akin to a porter/stout, but not quite. Layered notes of both roast and smoke aid the complexity without creating a messy clusterfuck. Smoke builds up more assertively on the finish and aftertaste, as well. The midtaste features some nice dark fruit flavors. Im impressed with how complex this is - other sips reveal varying flavors like chocolate, mint, licorice, and tobacco. Drinkability is sacrificed for savorability, and its better for it.

M: Silky and delicate. The heavy body makes it feel quite decadent, as well. In general, its just a joy to swish around in the mouth.

O: I dont know if I could have more than a single can of this in a session - simply because its meant to be savored rather than rapidly downed. Any beer that bears a passing resemblance to Schlenkerlas rauchbiers is a great thing, in my opinion. It strikes me as a fantastic cigar beer, too.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Appearance: The body is a beautiful color, a clear mix of deep garnet and dark brown, the thin is thin and tan with little lasting power, but theres a very light coating a thin ring.
Aroma: The aroma has a strong toffee and dark fruits aroma at first, but a light cocoa aroma is hidden beneath.
Taste: Raisin is the first flavor to greet my tongue, the flavor is a bit non-descript through the mid taste, a bit malty and some caramel, the caramel picks up on the finish with some dark fruits and a very light smoke on the finish that lingers a bit.
Palate: Medium body, slightly syrupy with light carbonation giving a light fizz and a light sharp stab.

Old Chub pours a burgundy brown color that allows a bit of light to pass through it with a ruby tint.  A frothy eggshell cap rests on top before gradually fading to a ring,

There is just a light sweetness to the aroma.  Softly sweet caramel and brown sugar stay mostly behind a generally malt presence.  Some dark fruit and peat round out the aroma.

The flavor is consistent and balanced all the way through.  A strong malt presence brings in a light caramel sweetness, some cocoa, dark fruits, and a touch of smokey peat.  The flavor gets a light bitterness as the flavor progresses, giving it a gentle balance.

The mouthfeel is about where I want it to be in a Scotch Ale.  The 8.0% ABV gives it enough heft, while the smooth and creamy carbonation works well with the flavor.

Pours a moderate brown color with an off white head. The nose is caramel and a slight touch of earthy hops. A bit of toffee and slight roast there as well. The taste is mostly a light caramel/toffee flavor with a bit of light fruits and some dry hops. The feel is nice and creamy; a bit heavy, but not overly so.

This sat reddish-russet with a tiny hint of lace, though its hard to know how representative that pour is given the glassware and the likelihood that the can had been open for an hour or so. The palate was a bit thin, but thats actually a plus for this style in my mind; you can stand a spoon upright in a GDBC Claymore, and who can drink 12 oz of that? Aromas and flavors included the peat firs you expect from a Scotch ale, but I found this just a tad too smoky to rank among the best examples of this style. Theres nothing wrong with a little smoke in the beer, but this verged on rauch (to my tastes) when I was expecting whisky notes.","Athens, Georgia, USA","bjt512"

689,"2011-04-01",3.5,"12 ounce can. Canned on 11/8/10. Drank 3/31/11. Poured into Duvel tulip. 
APPEARANCE:
Pours dark woody brown with ruby and burnt orange hues. 1+ finger head is off-white, light cream colored, and has somewhat short retention duration. 
AROMA:
Lightly roasted malts, smoked light-colored wood, hint of earthy element, dry dirt aroma that is pleasant, and touch of caramelized brown sugar. Some light malt sweetness, which seems somewhat like maple syrup that is running down the bark of a tree. Appears to exhibit an extremely faint off-aroma that is like moist vegetation.
Extremely faint hints of roasted coffee, cocoa, and perhaps even date syrup  though these attributes are marginal and in the background. 
TASTE:
Front and mid palate has rich malt sweetness. Smoked light-colored wood on back of palate. Back of palate has faint date as well.

Finish has pleasant hint of earthy/dry dirt character. Light hop attributes apparent on finish  though more flavor hop than bittering. The hop character seems herbal behind all other tastes. 
Extremely faint hint of caramel and chocolate malt. Moist vegetation from aroma is hardly discernible on palate. 
MOUTH FEEL: Full-bodied. Malty. Pleasant, lively carbonation. Subtle dryness on finish. Light roast bitterness on finish. Faint alcohol warmth on finish. 
OVERALL: Smokey element is fairly mild  just a hint of it. Expected a bit more smoke character. Pleasant for the mildness. Alcohol masked fairly well for the abv. Solid brew. Though enjoyable, unable to say it will be extremely memorable. Would have enjoyed a bit more smokiness.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"

To the purveyor of homebrew ingredients standing before me, this was as integral to a good scottish-style as was ""secret sauce"" to a Big Mac. The scales fell from my eyes when later I discovered the sauce recipe was hardly more than mayonnaise, French dressing, and relish - and that peat smoked malt wasnt necessary to scottish-style beers. What was necessary was the long carmelizing boil to perform a deep tissue massage on an otherwise malty beer.

Smell: The aroma has a pleasant sweet caramel, candy and roasted malt character.

Taste/Palate: Its light to medium body has a slightly thin texture. The overall flavor profile is sweet and candy like. There are plenty of caramel and toffee notes with some toasted bready maltiness and a slight fruitiness which reminds me of grilled peaches.

Taste is a huge load of unapologetic maltiness.  Dark, roasty, chocolaty, malty sweet, a touch of woody smokiness, and some burnt caramel.  Texture is creamy and finish is a bit boozy. Pretty much a dessert beer.

Flavor has a very full, almost bourbon flavor, with strong toasted malt middle and finishes with a semi sweet chocolate and alcohol note. Body is heavy, very sugary and has a very creamy texture due to the low fine carbonation present. Overall a fantastic brew.

The taste is also sweet and a mixture of vanilla, caramel and chocolate dominates until a slightly dry and ever-so-slightly smoky finish.

The mouthfeel is full bodied for a Scottish ale with a soft carbonation that all adds up to a serously creamy beer.

Its a little tough to compare this to other Scottish ales as it is bigger than almost all of them.  This one is more Scotch ale than Scottish.  Classification aside, its an excellent malt-forward beer.  Call it what you will, its damn tasty.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

689,"2010-07-09",3.9,"Thanks to jgasparine for this brew!  12 ounce can, canned on 6/30/2009 (printed on bottom of can).  The brew pours dark brown with about a half inch tan head that went away quickly.  Lacing is decent.  Aroma is pretty nice, its sweet and malty and it smells like caramel malt, peat, smoke, and dark fruit (plums).  It tastes like caramel malt, chocolate, smoke/peat, molasses, and a bit of dark fruit.  Even though the can is a year old, this is still a good brew!  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit syrupy and has moderate carbonation.  Drinkability is OK, its smooth and not hard to drink at all.  Not a bad beer, I liked it.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
689,"2010-07-08",4.1,"Aroma:Deeply malty with caramel. Dark malts. Maybe a little peat.

Appearance:Dark brown, almost opaque. Clear. Head does not persist very long.

Taste:The flavor is full of rich malts, with caramel. The midtaste has some raisin or plum flavor and a small amount of tartness. This beer starts of sweet, but leaves a medium to dry aftertaste.

Palate:This is a full bodied beer, that has a pretty thick body. The alcoholic warmth adds to the style.

The nose is a little subdued and I poured this into a dimpled mug and a shaker.  Pretty similar.  Its seems to have a malty, semi-sweet, honey and brown sugar nose.  Not much in the way of typical Scotches.  Im not getting any peat or charcoal.  Sweet malty flavor, chocolate, leather, some brown sugar, and very slight nuances of the roasty, peat like flavor akin to these types of brews.  Definitely not as strong as any Ive had.  No hop presence at all.  Finishes sweet and somewhat metallic.  Semi-viscous feel and syrupy.  This is the least ""whiskyish"" Scottish ale I have had.  Its not a bad thing unless you like Scottish ales alot.  However, I feel this particular brew has ""diswayed"" itself from others in the category by the lack of this singular characteristic alone.  Id say its more like an above average brown.","knoxville, Tennessee, USA","gsteph"

689,"2010-04-21",4.2,"A- Deep dark brown body that pours with 1 finger creamy medium tan head. Head slowly subsides to a thick and creamy collar. When held up to the light striking bright red hues are seen throughout this brew showing that it has a nearly transparent dark red body.

S- Deep and rich smell heavy in chocolate and caramel malt. There is a good balance between the two with hints of alcohol and smokiness creeping around within them.

T- A big, nice, healthy balance of caramel and chocolate malt upfront. The taste only gets stronger for the swallow where lots of sweet chocolate and caramel malt come through with a touch of a bitter bite. Some alcohol bitterness lingers-but it balances out the thick sweetness of the combination of malts that linger.

P- Medium to low carbonation and big thick and syrupy mouthfeel-almost like molasses. Extraordinarily smooth and creamy though.

O- Considering its thickness and its high ABV this is very drinkable. Im usually not a big fan of beers this heavy on malts but I really like this one. I will have it again. Besides it goes for the same price as Dales Pale around here...and is always included in the Lower tier of craft mixed 6-ers (Gordon is really expensive...and also very delicious). I guess you just cant go wrong with Oskar Blues.

Looks are dense, with bubbly lacing and no carbonation.  Aroma reminds me of a dry stout from a can, sweet and roasted, no doubt thanks to the ""copious amounts of crystal and chocolate malts"".  Flavor is a little sweeter than the aroma clues you in on, with just enough of the right malts to pull off a fantastic palate.  A very smooth mouth feel and overall experience.

Finger-width, very cream, brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is medium sweet malts and caramels with brown sugar and toffee. A faint chocolate accompanies some strawberries and dark fruits. Fairly earthy with a light smoke, peat, rye bread, and a hint of roast. Flavor is more the same. A good amount of brown sugar, rye bread, and berry caramels up front before a medium level earth and some peaty roast come in. The chocolate comes out more at the end along with some vanilla and a solid scotch ale booze. Finishes dry with a light, woody bitterness and a fairly lengthy aftertaste. Medium body and somewhat creamy with a moderate carbonation. Overall, a nice scotch ale. Medium sweet with a good amount of malts and a solid earthy, peaty, smokey balance. Nice, dry finish with a pleasant booze flavor. Very nice beer. (7,4,8,4,15=3.8). Re-rate (9/18/2012) from a 12oz can with a 11/04/2009 canned on date stamped on the bottom. This has been sittin around for quite awhile now after I picked this up in Vail, CO from a long ago trip. Pours a deep brown body with a finger-width, creamy, dark brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is fairly malty sweet with some black cherry dark fruits, a light chocolate, brown sugar and caramel, and a light roast and earth giving off a touch of rye spice. Flavor is similar. Caramels, toffees, and brown sugar with a nice chocolate backing. Sweet, but not cloying or excessive. More like a pleasant richness. A decent amount of black cherry dark fruits before this finishes with some light roast notes and a touch of earthy rye. Lengthy aftertaste following a creamy, medium body and a soft, medium carbonation. Overall, I wouldnt quite suggest aging this for almost 3 years, but its held up pretty well. The chocolate and brown sugar has really added a nice, rich depth without getting cloyingly sweet. Still has a light roast and earthy note, but the malts are still the bread-winner here.

There is a pile of malt in this brew.  The taste has a slight sourness and full of raisins, dates, and prunes.  Its surprisingly light in body (lighter in fact than I remember it being).

The flavors blend together very nicely, and yes, like everyone says, along with Oskar Bluess other releases, these are the best beers you can get in a can.  The question is why dont other brewers also use cans?  They are lighter, more compact, and probably sealed better too.  Can they affect the flavor?

Decent white-tan head full of big bubbles that disappeared for the most part, but left some lace until I finished it.

Flavor:  Not far off from the aroma.  Tastes a bit more like a whiskey than it smells....with a touch of woodsy smoke and rich malty sweetness that hides the alcohol fairly well.
Overall:  Decent malty scotch style ale.  Ive had better tasting ones for the style, but not out of a can!

The beer pours out a rich mahogany brown, with garnet edges but a scant sized head.  Perhaps the detergent used in the pint glasses killed the formation?  After several swirls, it was a pretty lifeless pour.  Aroma was sweet, almost fruity but in a soda pop/cola kinda way.  More notes I keep picking up were nuts and toffee but it was all seemed lost somehow.  Like I was only getting a quarter of what I was hoping to smell.  Odd.  Mouthfeel is a bit abrasive, but still mild mannered enough to enjoy.

A little musty too...like a basement.  something like a basement, i say.  Smokey too actually...like your fingers, 3 days after smoking a cigarette if you never washed your hands.

Theres nut flavors that come about as well...i cant really label it as any specific nut per se, but of all the flavors in the world, Im sure it comes closer to the general idea of nutty than any other general ideas out there.

Initial is a good bodied brew that packs the malty flavors in, toast, carmel, toffee, and a touch of chocolate dance with light peat and creamy vanilla and sweetness.

I drank the entire six pack and felt really good.  Took a bit to figure out why they dont bottle this, but the back of the can said it all.  ""Pack it in, pack it out.""

Flat looking, no carbonation and no head but thats mostly the style due to the high alcohol. A malty aroma full of wheat. A sweet overall smell without a hop comeback.

689,"2008-11-21",4.1,"Pours a surprisingly dark, with a light tan head.

Smell is of bitter coffee and molasses

The taste is a strong malt backbone with the roasted malts creating a smoky, coffee like feel. The molasses is present in the finish and brings the full spectrum together.

For the powerful flavor of this brew it is surprisingly light on the pallet. Carbonation is not heavy but not overly light either.

This is a good supping brew that I will definitely like to try again. It actually kind of tasted almost like a porter with the character of the roasted malts. A very well done brew overall.

Major peaty malts, like big time, and not much else, but whats there is so damn good smelling you dont really need much else. Flavour is like a punch in the face with peat, but for some reason you welcome the hit! But in all seriousness, huge peaty, chewy, delicious malts with a great full body to it, pretty smoky too.

689,"2008-07-31",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2008 5-10 years ago I would certainly have never agreed that a good beer could come in a can. Oh how times have changed.

One such cannery is the Oscar Blues Grill & Brewery. Along with Dales Pale Ale, they brew damn fine Scottish style ale, Old Chub.

You could drink it out of the can, but I prefer my beer poured and breathing, so to speak. Old Chub pours a dark coppery red/brown and smells beautifully. I partook of mine in a traditional ale glass, within which a slight head forms and then settles. Old Chub is definitely more on the Scotch Ale side then the Belhaven Scottish Ale which is much lighter and very floral. I definitely taste more of the sweet, malt flavor in Old Chub that is characteristic of a heavy Scotch Ale. There are hints of toasted bread amidst the malt and hints of caramel and chocolate. I will always liken this type of chocolate essence to dark chocolate do to the combination of sweetness and bitterness. Its not overly cloying, but just enough to leave hints of sweetness in your mouth after a long drag. A damn fine Scottish ale and one of the best canned beers I have ever had.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

The initial flavor was light to moderately sweet; while the finish was moderate to heavily sweet and lightly bitter with an average to long duration.

689,"2008-07-17",3.3,"UPDATED: JUN 1, 2016 June 20th, 2014 - Old Chub is a Colorado institution, and a drink I had early in my eligible beer drinking history, and one that Ive returned to, for late night gaming sessions to camping. The nitro version is just as splendid as the original, the same black darkness to the body, but a finer, silkier head, the color of a bakers apron. The aroma is malty, and very sweet, reminiscent of teriyaki and BBQ sauce, dripping with sweet, smoky and umami scents. Before I register the flavor, my palate catches a silky, sensually smooth body, with works very well with the flavors, which emerge like bubbles popping from a thick, smooth tar. The teriyaki gets played down, and dark honey and mesquite takes its place. Alcohol tries to add its signature burn, but the nitro cools it down, making a beer that is edgy, but goes down easy, leaving lingering flavors of sweet and smoked almonds as it makes its exit.

(3.3) Everytime I pop open one of these cans it is at once an act of defiance, an indulgence and a bold statement.  Tasty too.  The Old Chub pours an oak brown color, but gives no head save for a tepid brown halo around the rim of the glass.  This doesnt mean the beer is flat though.  A robust, strong waft of malts comes rocketing out of the glass, along with the smells of sweet coffee, grape juice, chocolate malt balls and brown sugar.  A rich medley to be sure.  The flavor is more bitter and more savory too.  Think of a bland kind of beef (chuck roast?) with a light chocolate malts accent and youll get a good idea of the semi-meaty semi-sweet flavor that makes this a sn easy to understand and easy to drink beer.  The aftertaste is a whole separate side of the Old Chub, spreading around the mouth with a coffee stickiness and the slightest glint of raisin.  Okay, so the flavor is a little plain, so maybe this is the littlest brother in the Oskar Blues family, but everyone needs their weakest link, and if this is as weak as OB gets, count me in for everything and anything they make.

Anyway, the flavor: sweet and sugary caramel followed by some roasted malt. The palate is a little syrupy, accentuating this beer’s singular drive to bang home sweet malts.

Impression: Deep dark ruby brown. Rich. tastes of chocolate, coffee, and smoke in a slightly watery base, but not badly so. Visually stunning. Head starts off tannish brown and thick, but reduces to a wispy foam with little head. Palate is slightly thin, but likely in keeping with the style. Im not that familiar with Scotch Ale. A very nice color and aroma, and the alcohol is hidden well. Not nearly as rich as a chocolate or coffee stout, but certainly a worthy ale.

M- A little light on the carbonation, medium viscosity.

But, once again, only lightly so. The chocolate, smoke, and malt come together in a swirl of delicat delight. Nothing over-powers anything else. A slow sip and push on the tongue is recommended, but you actually could chug this if you wanted to.

It pours out a nice shade of dark brown with red highlights with a thin beige head sitting on top. Smells of roasted malts, dark fruits, and smoky goodness. Has a well rounded sweet smoky flavor with some alcohol warmth appearing at the back of your throat. Feels nice and full as you swallow, slight amount of prickliness. finish is a long smooth smoky bitterness. The  8% abv goes wholly unnoticed in the taste.

This comforting sweetness only enhances the brew as it warms.  Sweet toffee notes on the front of the palate, possibly some esters that shine through later in the pull.  A deep roasted mid-palate adds woodiness and shapes the body.  Some light alcohol peppers the back palate and intermingles with the perfect amount of smoked earthen bitters (about 8-10% of the back palate, just enough not to detract).  Upon chewing the finish, there exists semi-sweet chocolates, adding complexity to the mouth.  Honestly, one of the better Scotch ales Ive had.  Im a sucker for this style, when its brewed much like a barleywine.... sweet, complex and comforting. ////// UPDATE: On draft at the brewery in Brevard, NC, ON NITRO (although the recipe is the same) the nitro pour makes for a super creamy mouthfeel and a very soft palate to enjoy this semi-smokey sweet treat.

Old Chub pours garnet with glowing mahogany highlights throughout when held to the light. A 2 finger tan head formed on the pour that eventually fell to a thick cap. Leaves drink lacing after each sip that slowly slides back into the body.

Dark aromas come from everywhere with this beer. Brown sugar, molasses, and sweetly roasted malts. Maybe even figs. Every now and then I catch a hint of smokiness. Chocolate abounds. As this beer warms the smokiness becomes more pronounced. Alcohol fumes rise on the finish. Very nice.

Flavor starts off with roasted maltiness and is quickly followed by unsweetened chocolate. A nice smokiness comes around mid palate and lasts through the finish. The smokiness is there but allows the other flavors room to work. Sweet creaminess on the finish. Very nice.

Medium bodied but as creamy as you could hope for. Mild carbonation with faint alcohol on the finish.

Im usually not a huge Scotch ale kind of guy but I could easily tilt a few of these back in a sitting.

Old Chub is a high, high quality Scottish ale. Very enjoyable and easy drinking. Big flavors but in no way overwhelming. Excellent.

Really digging this beer.

Pours a dark and thick brown. Thick head after each pour. Tanned brown. Dissolves down to a thinner film. Nose is sweet and full of caramel candy.

Flavor is comples. Tons of caramel. Chocolate and toffee. Maltiness has a solid backbone. Slight--ever so--hop bitterness. Then I find a smoky essence.

The aroma is a very interesting mix of roasted malts, chocolate, and smoked wood.  The flavor follows that same pattern, with a bit of caramel mixed in and a smokey, salty, bitter finish.  There is a distinct Earthiness to this beer.  It smells and tastes like something that came straight from nature, untouched by man.

I barely smelled the chocolate aroma, but the fruity smell was easily noticed. The color is awesome, a nice dark brown, looks like a porter to me. Great color for an ale, but this is my first Scotch Ale. Wow, what a delicious beer. Chocolate, sweet raisins, malt a very tasty brew. The beer is very smooth, and does not taste as if it came from a can, no acidic taste. The beer does not do one thing for me. It does not allow the flavors to puch my tastebuds! The sweet is noticeable without thought, but to taste what flavors are in the beer you have to smack your lips after a sip for a moment to determine the other flavors, the flavors should jump out in my opinion. I taste the beer and it is great, what I am saying is that the flavors are great but rather weak. I overall am pleased with the beer. Good brew!","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

Finishes with a deeper and more well rounded wood taste, followed by a linger earthy buttery hop flavor in the mouth.  The best part of this beer is how smooth the flavors are.

689,"2007-04-17",1.7,"UPDATED: JUN 25, 2011 Old chub, pleasant name!  This 12 oz can has many highs enscripted on the top rim of the can. Fun to look at. Very nice aromas, roasty aromas that make a dark beer very attractive to the nose.  And when you pour it out of the can, it is certainly dark. It has a dark tan head but it is not brown, just dark tan. The flavors are malty bitterness, just like the other Scotch Ale Ive tasted.  Strong alky content is readily apparent. The alky is not hidden and it is in your face, abrasive and flat. I am surprised to see such a style beer in a can from the USA. $2 at 3 sons and dogs in wexford PA. Will not buy again. This is not my style.  On par with McEwans Scotch Ale.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

The color was much darker than I had expected, a very dark brown with a dark red tint and a decent-sized, creamy dark tan head.  The aroma was malt-dominated, featuring roasty chocolate and caramel, with some underlying grainy hops.  It had a nice flavor, which was a sweet-bitter mixture and long lasting.  The palate was fizzy, slightly wet, and full.  A great beer for the spring, that could be had in most seasons.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"

A touch of burnt brown sugar and a hint of toffee blend into the flavor along with the elements present in the nose.  Im a hop-head, to be sure, but I enjoy a richly malty drink thats brewed this skillfully.

Great head retention throughtout the entire glass with some spotty lacing. Moderately assertive, but very complex aromas of peat smoke, burnt caramel candy, roasted malts, raisin, figs and cocoa greet the nose. Medium mouthfeel; fairly full and chewy but with a light fluffy texture. Flavors a bit more assertive than the aroma profile. Rich, complex notes of burnt caramels, peat -smoked dark roasted malts, dark brown sugar, spices, dark dried fruits, cocoa powder and earth are pleasantly expereinced. Some faint charred oak bourbon notes linger in the background. Alcohol is really an afterthought here with just a hint of warmness. Finish is long with a slight hop/charcoal bitterness.

Aromas of caramel, chocolate, malt, bread and a nice earthiness. Creamy on the fore of the tongue, a nice bit of the head coats the lips as well. Fore is roasted caramel and malts, some chocolate. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. Finish is dry, malty and long. First example of the scotch ale style I have tasted, and it certainly gave me an old chub. Very nicely done.

The depth of the malt really shines in the flavor, as each moment sees individual elements of the malt peel away like rings on an onion.  The problem is the unmistakable sour butteriness of the diacetyl.  While I tried to enjoy it, I couldnt look past the obvious infection.  It doesnt seem common for this beer, so I dont know what happened.  Hopefully Ill get another chance to try it and I see what it should be.

Ive already had a few of these, but it was time to sit down and rate one
   properly instead of merely enjoying it.  So I got out my tasting glass, a
   can of Old Chub and poured it to enjoy another one.  This is a good find and
   a great value at roughly a dollar a can.  Grab a six-pack and go camping.
Aroma / Appearance - The tan coloured one-finger head sat on top of the
   murky black body.  It reminded me of squid ink - deep black with only a hint
   of light escaping.  The nose was a balance of malt, smoke, peat and raisins.
   I almost felt like I was in Scotland when I closed my eyes.
Flavor / Palate - The flavor profile of this beer is very complex.
   First I picked up chocolate, liquid peat, cherries, caramel butter and velvet
   cake.  Next came a smoky wave, on which rode the flavors of raisins.  There
   was a slight bitterness which lingered on the tongue for a few minutes before
   it gave up.  This is probably the second best beer I have had in a can, the
   first being the Dales Pale Ale from the same company.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Aroma is rich and malty; mainly sweet and caramel, but also a bit of roastiness, smoke, and chocolate.  Flavor has the same elements, but is a robust bittersweet than outright sweet, with a well-blended mix of many malt flavors.  Smooth and slightly creamy on the palate, with relatively low carbonation.  I was surprised when I found out it was 8% alcohol; I wouldve guessed 5%.  Quite good, and in a can and reasonably priced at that.","Falmouth, Cornwall, ENGLAND","Delirium"

689,"2006-07-07",3.8,"12 oz. can.  Drank on 6/21/06.  Foams out of the can when you open it.  Pours very dark brown, almost black, and it has some red tint.  Big 1.5"" creamy tan head.  Drops to a layer of foam.  Decent lacing.  Foam layer eventually disappears.  Aroma - nice, malty, smokey, roasty aroma.  Fairly strong.  Flavor - initially sweet and bitter.  Then smooth on the tongue.  Some of the roasty, smokey, peaty malt flavors in the swallow, and a return of some sweetness in the finish.  Tiny bit of alcohol warmth.  Palate - fairly full bodied.  Not the biggest body ever, but substantial.  Low to avg. level of carb.  A little surprising since it foams out of the can and pours a big head.  Mouthfeel is also smooth and creamy.  Overall - I like this beer.  I like OB beers and I really like the can.  Sometimes you need cans.  I keep OC and DPA around because they are good beers in cans.  But I like the beer too.  This one is a little on the sweet side, but thats OK.  Good aroma, flavor, and a nice, full body.  I assume this is a wee heavy.  I like Scottish ales too.","USA","WhiteSoxFan"

Pours with a thick dark tan head, and with a body color that more closely resembles porter than a scottish ale.  They mention the generous amounts of chocolate and caramel malts-- you can tell.  The body is a little heavy, but the flavor is just perfect.  Peaty, sweet, caramel, with some roasty, coffee overtones.  Low bittnerness, moderate carbonation.

Cherishing aroma dabbles in peat, jerky briefly held in burlap bags, honey roasted peanuts, dry milk chocolate, caramel coursing through brown sugared pralines and hints of crème brûlée pudding.  Cocoa butter takes a brisk aluminum flagpole lick to kick off the flavor.  Greasy caramel lozenges partially spiced with cinnamon and pepper.  Smoked peat plays out with a flavor akin to the damp bottom of a grain bag residing on a rain-sodden barnyard floor.  Slight accent of smoked ham.  Chocolate covered Werthers originals and Rolos staying in the Christmas stocking over the off-season.  Fairly flavorful array that covers the palatary playing field, but a touch thin in the liquids recession.  That being said, this is the caramel-chocolate-smoked malt show.  Cola contributions and smoke roasted (unsalted) walnuts bring up the rear, paired with aluminum, pinching spice accents and dry chocolate shavings.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Another six pack, this one only $7.20 from the liquor store across the way. Ever since that Halloween parade in Atlanta a few years ago, Old Chub has fallen out of my favor.

The aroma is really something quite nice (and thats forgetting that it came out of a can!).  Chocolate (Tootsie Roll), sweet maltiness, caramel, a hint of spicey hops, and a touch of alcohol when swirled.  The palate is a little thin, but slightly tacky and refreshing, with too much big CO2 in there... I think nitro would be a perfect fit for this beer maybe.  The flavor is much simpler than the aroma, straight up malt, smoke, alcohol, with a slight chocolate aftertaste  that matures into alcohol and hops.  Regardless of what people said, there is nothing metalic tasting about this beer.  Still, I cant believe this came out of a can!
5-10-06:
Upon cracking open another can, I still find all the characteristics as last time, but the flavor has either matured or my tastebuds have.  The flavor is bigger than the aroma for sure.  Delicious creamy chocolate malt really hits you first, with the smoke secondarily.  theres something in this that almost reminds me of a coke and rum.  That sweet alcohol taste.  The texture is also a fair deal more creamy and smooth than I gave this beer credit for.

Some espresso elements, a bit of anise, and cigar aromas are also detected.  Mostly transparent burgundy/mahogany color with a frothy, fine light tan head.  Wish it were darker and more opaque with a creamier head.  Candy-like sweet chocolate start, turning more roasted and malty with a bit of coffee in the middle.  Nice, spritzy cabonation--perhaps overly carbonated.  Finishes with more peatiness.  Would be very dangerous, seductive, and overly drinkable if they toned down the carbonation.  I also wish this was darker.  Other than that, this is some nice stuff.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

The nose is long and complex with single malt scotch at the fore, rum-dipped cigar, toasted oak, molasses and moss. While the beer is quite rich there is very little sweetness no more than vanilla extract and bittersweet chocolate. There is a nice enough hop presence to provide balance and offset the density off the malt with just a little zip. A great effort, and from a can as well.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","outerupt"

Flavor was confusing and a bit of a let-down after the nose... all of the smooth, sweet, and smoky malts were present from the nose.. but there were odd metallic highlights and the herbal bitterness around the sides was not well-placed.

Aroma is a big kick of yummy peat and wood smoke and sticky-sweet nutty malts.  Its way more smoky than I expected, thats a pleasant surprise.  But the beer doesnt seem to have a definite direction - its very sweet and rather than being a showcase of its malts, seems more a simple conglomeration of many sweet malty flavors, not complex as advertised.  Im not going to lie, I am really enjoying the smoked malts, but the rest just seem to be getting in the way with all their caramel, toffee, taffy, and some unsettling mineral notes.  Finishes with some slight cocoa and lacticity that combine to give a dusty driness out of left field.  After all the near cloying sweetness of the beer, this ashy and dusty finish is not only out of place, but pretty unsettling.

It leaves a thick beige head that never goes away. 

As I smelled this ale the roasted chocolate, smokey nuts, and some floural essence is very present maybe honeydew, lilacs. The taste of this beer is sweet up front with chocolate malt that penatrates to core of the palate, then a small hint of bitterness rises up from the malted chocolate to relax the palate after the sweetness and finished with a smokey smooth coating on the throat like a finely made ""bechemel sauce"".

Odd thing about the beer, is that theres no explosive CO2 release when you pop the top.  I almost thought I had a leaky bottle -- but, its got plenty of carbonation.  Aroma is fantastic - milk chocolate raisins, peat and a bit crackery.  Moderately sweet and biscuity, a bit porterish, smokey.

Caramel character is a moderate.  Well balanced and cleanly malty.  Although, the malts are a bit light in flavor with chocolatey and lightly roasty notes.  Balanced to malt throughout from start to finish, aftertaste is a bit roasty and only hints of smokey.  Fuller body, well hidden alcohol, smooth and creamy texture for the low medium carbonation.  Wow, another great canned beer from Oskar Blues.

Drank it on 8/17/2005.Pours a deep, chestnut, burgundy-hued-mahogany brown.  Good amount of well-retained yellowish head.  Tiny can-conditioned bubbles.  Smells sweet, caramally, toffeeish with prunes, vinous notes, light hickory smoke (guess its actually beechwood).  Soy, chocolate, moist, fruity, rummy fruitcake with vanilla and hazelnuts.  Ahh, scotch ales can be so rich and complex in the nose and this is a prime example.  Flavor begins with buttercream, nuts, sharp bready malts, a bit too dry/astringent at first.  Dry and bready, moderately acidic.  Retro hops are green and leafy.  No alcohol, light earthy yeastiness.  Mouthfeel is very oily, slick and smooth.  Carbonation is nearly non-existent.  Actually, a touch watery on the end.  Nuts, soy, roasty barley on the finish.  Acidic and just way too much astringency.  Medium body.  Butter-toffee and caramel linger.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

689,"2005-07-22",3.7,"Can. This one was interesting. Drinking from the can, I found the aroma to be overbearingly sweet and a bit heavy on the alcohol. It pours a dark brown with a decent head and loses a lot of that sweetness in a glass, revealing toffee, caramel, coffee, and general ""roasted"" aromas. The flavor followed suit-- initially, cold from the can, it was very sweet and almost soda-like; but as it warmed up and sat in the glass for a while everything mellowed down to become a nice, even, malty beer. Tasted much more like a good Brown Ale to me than a Scottish, although I am hesitant to buy ""Scottish"" beers because it seems to be a style without definition-- from full bodied earthy browns like this to thin, watery, tacky-sweet lagerlike disappointments. Im impressed with Oskar Blues cans, but buy the Dales Pale Ale.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","walter"

Moderate hop bitterness but no real hop flavor to boot.  Slightly fruity and complex ester profile to complement the malt and smoke.

Negatives:  not as rich or complex as advertised, flavor a bit flat - could use more (some?) hops to perk it up, faint but definite aluminum can flavor, barely carbonated, a bit on the ""sweet and bland"" side.

Aroma is a bit light of toasted and roasted malts and a light smokiness. Taste is of light malted milk balls more smoke and just a touch of peat. Nice hoppiness and light grains taste.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
689,"2004-10-04",3.6,"GABF2004... Poured a dark brown color with a light tan.  Aroma of roast, peat, and sweet caramel malts.  Nicely roasted, chocolate smoke and more caramel.  A very nice Scottish ale, especially since it comes from a can.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
689,"2004-10-03",3.8,"Pours a deep brown with ruby hints and a large well developed white head. Nice lacing that doesnt develop naturally but does develop when it is messed around with

Nose is deep. Sweet malts and roasted malts are huge. Toffee and burnt chocolate throughout as well.

Cabonation is sparse. Somewhat light in flavor. Chocolate, subtle smokiness sweet malts and a nice hop bite on the finish. Mouthfeel is full until then finish when it thins out and becomes watery. Nice flavor profile throughout the beer. Nothing great, but totally solid.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
689,"2004-08-10",3.7,"Again with the can. By far the darkest beer I have ever poured from a can. Deep dark garnet body topped by a creamy tan head. Very pleasing sweet caramel malt aroma. The flavor is sweet and smoky, the two cornerstones on which any great scottish ale is made. Roasted nutty malts are medium in their presentation, the hops are more pronounced they I am used to in this style,, hough I think that here it works. The palate is medium with a bit of an acidic finish. While not really wholly to style my only out right complaint is the acidic/metallic finish. Is this from the can? Personally I have not near enough experience with good canned beer to say. The canned Pale Ale from the same brewer is better and does not exhibt the odd finish so that would seem to preclude the can as culprit. Who knows?","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
689,"2004-08-09",2.6,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2008 like others, i balked at the canned presentation. pure asthetics should matter little in a taste rating, but i harbored suspicions and prejudice. budweiser, dogfood, spam and creamed corn come in cans.  yet even after sniffing both the can and product-- like a desparate hound dog who’s lost the trail-- i could find no overt flaw owing to the can. i was almost disappointed. i think i cling to a purist’s perhaps overly strict sense of propriety. i appreciate the finesse of formality: nice things deserve care and attention and even indulgence in packaging. that’s why your beloved uncle nate wasn’t buried in a greasy 55 gallon drum found out behind the rendering plant. no, the family probably shelled out for the deluxe rosewood casket.  likewise, you don’t serve a taste of 20 year old single malt scotch in a cracked jelly jar. the aluminum can is the very emblem of our disposable society, cheapness, and a gale-force bean-fart in direction of the gentility we associate with genuine craftsmanship.  yet, removed from it’s peasant rags, here it is, the old chub: a undeniably gorgeous pour of clear reddish brown like jellied dates, while the head itself is substansial enough to be taxed as real estate.  the aroma has the liknesses of wood polish, apples and cherry coke, with a nod to peat and melting brown sugar. the carbonation is mild, the body is milky with desert-like sweetness first to emerge as a flavor sensation; then the figgy demensions of the malt show some character: you taste the hard, dark soles of boots used to crush nearly burnt figs into a gummy mass, and the firm alcoholic component tells you that this is no soda pop.  then comes a substansial bitterness, and this comprises a fault in my taste: it’s a bitter touch of something like anise-- black licorice.  i’m not crazy about anise.  finally, in a category of beer styles more known for failure and mediocrity than sheer greatness, this is a notable and serious entry, and even the most unflattering packaging couldn’t disguise that. 

re-rate: 9/17/08: the bitterness reminds me of sea weed and ground fish bladders: tinny, fishy and unbearable...","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"
689,"2004-07-28",3.7,"Can...poured into a Scotch thistle glass this time...nice head and lace, deep brown color. Aroma is malt, chocolate and slight smoke.  A big, thick, rich beer, best fit for dessert, I think.  Flavor is sweet carmel malt along with lightly smoked chocolate.  Quite yummy, no alcohol noticed in the flavor...I wonder how beer ages in a can?","Nebraska, USA","mdi"
689,"2004-07-14",3.4,"Popped open this can while standing under our canopy, waiting for the rain to stop at Glacier Basin campground in Rocky Mountain NP.  Didnt expect much aroma, but was pleasantly surprised by the strong sweet malty hop smoke that came out of the can.  The beer is very smooth and thick with malt and a very nice dry finish.  At 8%, its stronger than it tastes.  This was really good.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
689,"2004-07-08",3.2,"Can: Deep reddish brown hue with a large creamy tan head and good lace. The aroma has notes of caramel, buttered biscuit, mocha, floral hops, and earthy yeast esters. The taste starts moderately sweet with a noticeable malt presence. The finish has a smoky and twangy fruit tone. The feel is crisp bite and smooth layering. The alcohol is well masked. This beer makes you wonder what would happen if more micros would starts producing canned versions of their best brews, what would the BMC crowd think. Forget the can, this beer stands on its own merit, darn good. Thanks Mark.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
689,"2004-07-03",3.9,"TAP: Looked like a glass of coke, smelled sweet and malty, caramel, flavor is the same, sweet caramel, almost no bitterness. Not utterly complex but quite flavorful, if you like caramel.","Jeannette, Pennsylvania, USA","dolemike1"
689,"2004-06-25",3.7,"Can. Pours minimal tan head. Very dark, sparse light penetration gives reddish highlights in glass. Silky sweet obvious caramel flavor works well & does not overburden senses. Slides down the throat with ease. Faint roasted aftertaste. A minimally bitter brew thats sweet as can be without being annoying and I would drink this again. I like to think of this as Red Stripe on steroids. Can reminds me of those fruit drinks in the breakroom machine at work that nobody ever buys.","Southside, Richmond, Virginia, USA","Norton"
689,"2004-06-05",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2004 The start of a night of sampling on Whalemans deck-dubbed the 548 Fest. Pours dark brown with a medium tan head. Big malty, chocolatey aroma. Light roastiness. Chocolatey in the flavor with a mildly sweet finish. Good beer and at 8%, packs a punch.","Nolanville, USA","MrRomero"
689,"2004-06-05",3.8,"CAN!!!  pours deep amber hue with nice tan head.  nice carmel, earthy, buttery chocolate notes on the aroma.  Somewhat like that of old peculier.  velvet-y palate with nice earthy tones-some chocolate in the flavors.  long peaty finish.  very solid Scotish Ale!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
689,"2004-06-02",3.6,"Bronze body and thick velvety tan head. Huge caramel nose and a hint of smoke. Aroma reminds me of campfire-roasted marshmallows. Flavor is moderately sweet with some subtle smoke and just enough spicy bitterness to hold the beer together. Chocolate malts come out in the flavor. Also has a distinct rum quality. Smooth palate with nice fullness. Tasty stuff. I like the unpretentious beer in a can shtick.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
689,"2004-05-23",3.3,"I really dig this brewerys philosophy--going against the can stereotype (the flavor doesnt suffer at all IMO) and I like how the brewmaster refers to himself as a ""healer."" as well. Ive never tasted beechwood in a beer (to my knowledge) before..maybe Ive tasted the same flavor in other Scottish ales? Mouthfeel is rather thin but it is an ode to malts and smoked peat flavor specifically. Gets a bit stale as it warms but the flavors are hidden when cold. Id get it if the price was right. Thanks to Kinz for hooking me up!","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
689,"2004-05-19",3.7,"The Old Chub pours dark brown with deep red highlights.  It has a good sized, tan head that quickly goes down to a film.

Its aroma is roasted malts, with hints of chocolate and figs.

The taste is sweet, chocolate malts initially with some hints of fig.  It has a bitter, slightly acidic, coffee-like finish.  The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, leaving a sticky residue.

Overall, a nice, well-balanced, scottish ale.  Definitely the best beer Ive ever had in a can.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"
689,"2004-05-13",3.9,"I must send the Thanks out to Aubrey in Colorado Thanks again for the trade Bro!!

  Pours with a awfully dark body, a deep hue of amber; Nahhh, crimson, and the head is a billowing kaki color rocky and lush! The aroma is mouth watering! Notes of chocolate malt soar from the glass! Coco, coffee, winter dates and figs are abundant. 
HOT DAMN! The flavor is robust and toasty as the Devil! Essence of deeply kilned chocolate malt up front here as well! Toffee, rasins, and oak are found. This is Unlike any Scottch Ale Ive ever had This is more of a Baltic Porter, or Imperial Stout IMO!! MAN, Im not even going to discuss the mouthfeel of a beer named Old Chub, just so I dont humiliate myself. DAMN, Im Very Impressed Here; this is the BEST beer I will ever have out of a can!!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
689,"2004-04-20",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2004 Pours a clear deep amber color, and is topped by a good light brown head.  Sticky, malty, candied notes waft from my glass as I pour.  When I go in for a deeper sniff, I get toasted malt notes and a hint of roast malt at the end.  Wow, this has a good solid mouthfeel and a nice rich body.  There are lots of malt flavors here (caramel, biscuit, quite chewy actually).  Perhaps a hint of roasty smoke in the finish.  This beer is also subtly fruity with notes of raisins in it.  This is a damn good beer in a can, certainly the best I have had up to this point.  The hop perception is appropriately quite low, with only a hint of balancing bitterness in the finish.  This is damn tasty, for any beer, and it really hits the spot right now.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
689,"2004-03-13",3.6,"Poured from a can! Almost black. Faint light peers through revealing a deep red shine. Medium tan head. Not bad! Nose is malted, but has a sweetened note or two along with a hint of roasted character. The taste itself is most definitely roasted and mixed with sweetened malt. Some coffee notes as well. Almost like a watered down or lighter Old Rasputin. Damn good beer, nonetheless!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
689,"2004-02-26",3.8,"Deep brown with a touch of ruby, OK but fading head.  Can.  Strong roasted aroma, quite appealing in nature.  Flavor is malt focused, with more definite roasted notes melded with caramel and a bit of earthiness from the hops, seemlessly integrated.  There is a touch of smoke here as well.  Nice take on the style.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
689,"2003-12-28",3.6,"Can: Very dark with a mahogany glow; tan head. Smooth and creamy and softly carbonated. Roasty, with notes of peat and light smoke. Big doses of caramel. Hint of sweet fruit and herbal hops. Finishes with a strong and lingering bitterness.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
689,"2003-12-27",4.0,"The second canned beer from this great Colorado brewery, and as It sets in the glass a quite deep sanguineous color with ruby high lights, head is portly in size, creamy in texture and the color a toothsome light tan, as the head slowly evaporates a fine sheet of lace develops to seal off the glass, and as its consumed a fine set of Irish Rings is left behind to track your progress. Sweet malt nose, hints of toasted grain, fresh, crisp and quite pleasing to the olfactory and Ocular senses, start is sweet, nicely malted, top rich and pleasant in its feel to the palate. Finish is benignly acidic, the hops delightful in their spiciness, aftertaste quite dry, a fine representative to the style and one unfortunately we dont see much of here in the west.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
689,"2003-12-27",3.5,"Canned.  Drank from can to get the full effect.  The ""3"" for appearance is a guess.  I can't say that I've ever had an 8 percent ABV Scotch Ale in a can before, but I liked it.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
689,"2003-06-25",3.7,"Seductive aroma--a bit of peat and smoke as well as sweeet malt.  Nice texture of malt complexity.  A bit of buttery diacetyl, but not offensive.  Nice scottish ale.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
689,"2002-10-07",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 12, 2011 On tap GABF 02:  Sweet malty aroma, hazy deep orange color, full rich mouthfeel.  Ends a little sweet, and stays with you for a while.  Great malt profile.  Also Can 11","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
689,"2002-01-13",3.4,"UPDATED: MAR 26, 2006 100% blind rating.

Head is initially large, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing.

Body is dark amber to medium brown.

Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, molasses, toasted nuts), lightly hoppy (herbs), with light notes of smoke, tobacco, and plum.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, velvety texture, soft/lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

Even done completely blind (my previous non-blind score was 3.2), Im still not wild about this one, but its certainly decent.  Too sweet to fully enjoy.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
