Ce nest pas mal fait du tout,simplement trop floral pour mon plaisir personnel. En bouche le liquide admet une base céréalière beaucoup plus affirmée, ce qui maide à trouver la paix en ce jardin fleuri.

Flavour, like nose, is complex and built around layered grain character with sweet toffee, slight molasses, toast, nuts, smoke, a range of fruit flavours spanning sweet, tart and even bitter, with a particular spicy fruit I cant place seeming unique.

502,"2016-04-28",4.3,"Pours as dark as a stout. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

Outstanding nose of leather, plum, tobacco, fig and chocolate plus subtle molasses and smoky oak.

Light full body that is extremely smooth and approaches creamy. Superb carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a fairly prickly finish. The carbonation / body balance is very well done.

The flavor profile is quite outstanding and very complex. The flavors of the nose all deliver but dont quite separate completely. It begins with the dark fruits over a slightly sweet base with notes of caramel and molasses. The heavier flavors (leather, tobacco) slowly ascend towards a mildly bittered middle then linger in the background. Light smoky oak serves as the transition to the finish with dark fruit again taking center stage. The highest sweetness level appears here as well over a rich wave of chocolate. The slightly dry finish provides a touch of astringency and back of the throat warmth while a rich caramel and chocolate slowly fade.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

502,"2015-04-06",4.0,"Adam, a dark, nut-brown pour, the liquid capped with a sliver of dense khaki head, soft and seemingly tenacious. The aroma from my glass is nutty; rich figs steeped in caramelizing brown sugar, and yes, just a bit smoky. Right off the bat and without even thinking about it, Im craving a cigar, dark libraries and old books. There is so much more to that scene imagined, but I shouldnt go into it now. Something akin to film noir, but so much more modern...
The head clings to the surface, not letting go for a second as I tip the glass for a swallow.
The carbonation is just right, carrying the moderately sweet brew passed my lips and over my tongue; full-bodied, but not heavy at all. A bite on my gums, the flavor is smokier than the aroma; the fruit becoming darker and more tantalizing with each draw. I drink in, I breathe out, the experience will need to happen again, Im sure of it. The next time, I will age this and find yet another whole and complex profile within the bottle. I am hooked.

502,"2014-05-18",4.4,"I got this in a trade and decided to open this up tonight.
I see that this is batch 91.
I poured this into a snifter.
The appearance is a nice dark brown color perhaps close to black. The head is a good two and a half fingers of white foaminess. There is a decent amount of adequate foamy lacing spider webbing all over the place.
The smell has a hearty roasty meatiness up front with a decent sweet sticky chocolate coming in behind.
The taste was fairly balanced between the meatiness and the chocolate. The aftertaste is somewhat a good balance between the meatiness and the chocolate. The finish is quick and dry.
On the palate, it sits about a medium with not too much of any sessionability about this. Im finding this one to be more of a sipper. Do I feel the ABV? Perhaps. The carbonation is exceptionally smooth, whoah, wow, very smooth.
Overall, ok, this is a wonderful representation of the Old Ale style, big wow from me. Though very different from my all time favorite of this style, I still like this one a lot and would definitely have it again. So glad I finally had the opportunity to try it.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Aroma is pretty complex, notes of molasses, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits, definitely like a fruitcake.

1994 bottle At Hair of the Dog with Taylor, Stephen, Dina, and Rob. Pours dark dark maroon some head that goes away. Aroma is musky figs, woody, some soft cardboard, hint if maple. Taste is neutral and even, everything has mellowed out, soft fluffy figs, smooth alcohol that cone through in a nice raison burn, dark cherries, almost no oxidation. Very interesting drink, I drank it side by side with the 2013 and the sweetness and rough edges have faded. 3.9","Dallas, Texas, USA","Experiment_Ale"
502,"2014-03-12",3.2,"Batch 91. I was really looking forward to this one. Ordered it on line. Can't get HOD beers in Michigan. Maybe, I was expecting too much, but I was quite disappointed. Aroma is nice, but the taste and palate is lacking. Mouthfeel is medium, but with zero carbonation, totally flat. Taste is some dark fruit, but I get a strange, dusty dryness in the throat. Hopefully, Fred is much better. Ordered one if those as well. I think there was something wrong with my bottle of Adam.

A: Pours dark brown with a couple fingers of mocha head which fall quickly to a sheet of the same. Lace is there, but falls slowly in a sheeted quality to leave spots. Clarity: nada. With a bit of agitation a finger of foam arises and is persistent, and this time, the legs of foam stick.

S: Smells of coffee, oats, bits of licorice, some prunes. This beer has depth, and I dig it. Really dig it.

T: See smell, add some sugars, molasses, a hint of oxidation. This is a fine beer. Hints of tobacco and oakiness.

M: thick and viscous with some nice lively carbonation. As it warms, i suggest giving it some substantial swirls to make sure it flattens out a bit. A little hi on the carb. Long deep finish.

O: I really dig this beer. Its alive. Appropriate now, and I expect will age well.

502,"2013-12-08",3.9,"Batch 86, no date shown on the site but Id guess this is at least a year old.
Appearance: The body is opaque with light showing only through the edges, the body appears a muddy color though, accompanied by a short and dense khaki colored head. The head dissipates into a hearty coating with a dense ring.
Aroma: The aroma is big on raspberry and black cherry with a light tobacco smoke to this, kind of like cherry wood with a slight meaty quality. The aroma comes off wine-like, very enticing. The strength is moderate, leaning sweet, and boy it smells nice.
Taste: The intro is mild giving off a young fruity port wine reminiscent flavor. The middle quickly becomes cherry and tobacco heavy, it reminds me of smoking my cherry tobacco from a pipe. Dry and smokey on the finish. This is very nice, slight charred aspects to it, but I feel like I cant fully enjoy it without a pipe.
Palate: Full-bodied, almost chewy, with very mild carbonation.
Overall: A hearty old world ale indeed. I cant help but think that Im cheating myself out of this experience without some tobacco and my pipe. This is a nice beer, though I feel a bit too heavy on the tobacco at the end, especially for non smokers. Well done.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Aroma is very rich and malty with a fairly fruity profile as well. Lots of figs and lighter amounts of raisins and plums. Light chocolate, moderate caramel, light leather and light toffee with hints of toasted bread. 
Pours a dark brown with a moderately thick dark tan head with fairly good retention. Many minutes later a film still remains on top and is thicker along the edges. Moderate lacing and medium light legs. 
Flavor is initially fairly sweet with some toasted bread, leather and smoke notes. Light chocolate and tobacco with a background fruitiness. Medium light fig, plum and cherry. Medium bitterness with some alcohol spice in the finish. As your palate adjust the chocolate becomes more noticeable. Finish is fairly sticky sweet with some lingering chocolate, leather and fig. 
Mouthfeel is medium full to full bodied with medium to medium low carbonation. Light astringency and medium light alcohol warmth. 
Overall a very enjoyable and impressively complete beer. The profile changes quite a bit as it warms with it initially being fairly smokey but then more chocolatey with some tootsie roll flavors. It does a good job hiding its alcohol but it is a bit sticky sweet in the finish.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

502,"2013-08-26",4.1,"2 oz bottle courtesy of daknole. Thank, Dakine! Amazed Ive never had this. Happy to finally have it. Pours a deep brown black hue, well hazed but not opaque. Not black but more a cola-esque brownish hue. Glowing ruby brown edges and bottom. A cakey light brown head atop stays as a firm layer, sticks around, laces pretty well. Aromas show carmelized malt and biscuit, dry elements, earthy hops, gentle heat. Subtle dried dark fruit and mellow cocoa. Some fuller biscuits, gentle yeast and spice. Gentle earthy smoke, some leather and more subtle dark fruit. Not sweet, but full and rich, a good complexity and quite pleasing. Initial is fuller bodied, a touch thicker into the middle. Toasty and biscuity elements meet a gentle earthy smoke. Soil, leather, and gentle cocoa elementsm firmly carmelized and biscuity, darker sweet slant. Touches of dark dried fruit. Gentle yeastiness, subtle yet growing vinous quality, dark fruit, black cherry. Gentle warmth grows. Biscuity and gentle toasty presence. Touches of cocoa, rye bread, biscuit, and gentle black and earthy malts. Not really ever roasty. Full and complex, a melange of elements that just work very well together for a strong ale. Still a nice dry and toasty element, this beer doesnt really ever get too sweet. Backend is toasty and more dark fruit influence, some dryness and more toast. Earthy, touches of leather, firmer dark fruit really back here. Finish is a touch of molasses, faint anise, toast and darker earthy slant. Some dryness, gentle warmth.

502,"2013-07-22",5.0,"This is one beer that lives up to the reviews. It is simply incredible.

The aroma is unexpectedly fruity, and at the front is a ripeness that Ive only ever had from citra hops (might come from others too that Im unfamiliar with). There are faint tastes too of pine and orange.

Once this thing sits on your palate you get chocolate (which gives a slight jaffa flavour with the orange notes), tobacco, coffee, all matched nicely with a subtle hop bitterness. Its malty rich but not too sweet. 

The texture is like a thick chocolate milkshake, but in a good way. Its thich and creamy and smooth.

Unbelievable.","AUSTRALIA","BradMc"

A: Pours a very deep purple with a 1 finger light tan head. Slowly dissipates leaving a thick ring around edge. The ring reveals a wonderful splatter pattern lace as the beer disappears into my belly.

S: Im picking up some very earthy and woody notes at the front. This gives way to some light smells dark fruits. Little raisins and ripe dates. A little boozy on the backend with some sweet malts.

T: Not as impressed with the taste as I was with the nose. A watered down woodiness gives way to some light sweetness from the fruits and the oat malts. The backend actually provides more flavor for me. There is a little sweet booze kick with a nice smooth oak finish.

M: Medium bodied with a very oily touch. Medium carbonation. Leaves a sweetened oaky taste over the palate.

O: This beer had some ups and downs. The nose was great, but the initial tasting fell flat. The backend picked it back up however and turned a decent brew.

A: This is one of the most impressive looking beers I have ever seen. The body is opaque, and the darkest of browns, bordering on black. There is a magnificent, gargantuan, creamy head that absolutely refuses to fade. 15 minutes of letting the beer sit: There is now ""only"" an inch and a half of whipped cream head. Now that has receded a smidge, I can see that there is a thick sheet of lacing that I dont think the dishwasher wants any part of.

S: Cigar smoke, figs, toffee, alcohol, leather, malt

T: This beer is insanely complex. Im already sad that I dont have more of these in the cellar (that will change). There is a prominent aroma and flavor of leather or cowhide. Its actually quite good. The myriad of flavors are woven together with artful precision. Hints of smoke add a pleasant touch to the bold flavors of sweet malt, fig, dark fruits, toffee and alcohol.

This pours a nice deep brown color with an energetic creamy tan head. Nice retention, and a bit of lace sticks to the side of the glass.

There are some noticeable alcohol phenols in the nose. Lots of brown sugar, molasses, and caramel to go along with the figs and raisins. 

Somehow the taste never gets too sweet, even with molasses, lots of brown sugar, and caramel malts up front. Rum soaked figs and raisins come in next, with a little bit of a grassy hop bitterness to cut through the sweetness at the end. 

Full bodied, pleasant smooth and creamy, with a little bit of hop residue and a fair amount of sweet stickiness.

2.0 A: Dark brown color. No head at all. None. Not surprised, but disappointed nonetheless.

3.5 S: Loads of tobacco and raisin. Date, fig, and prune after that. Sweet toffee and caramel. Minor notes of oxidation. This smells pretty good despite no carbonation. Itd proabably be amazing with some.

3.5 T: Tobacco and rum raisin kick this off. Dates, figs, prunes, toffee, and plenty of caramel. Basically the same as the nose. Again, some sherry-like oxidation. Same as the nose. Would be much tastier with carbonation.

1.5 M: Heavier medium body. Not fully flat, but whatever is the lowest detectable amount In any case, it ruins whatever creaminess this had in store.

2.5 D: I think this could be a damn good beer if it was allowed to be. As it stands, its at the lower end of average. With carbonation, I could see this easily breaking the 4s. But, I wont know tonight. Ive been having nothing been trouble with b-wines from the cellar and their carbonation lately. Its starting to grow tiresome.

502,"2011-10-27",5.0,"Drinking Batch 83 this evening; wow, all I can say is that these recent batches have been dynamite; the consistent carb levels of late rounds the beer out even more and adds a layer of creamy complexity that I think is better than ever; even though it isnt a malt liquor, Adam truly is the perfect beer!! 

Side-by-side in December 2009: Batch 76, Batch 73 and Batch 43:

Batch 76 (Fall 2009)  4.5
12 oz. bottle; batch 76 (fall 2009); much more carbonated than the other vintages and more along the lines of the 09 doggies claws (gold cap) with a thick, creamy tan head fading slowly; there is no doubt what carbonation can do for richness of the aromas; sugar, peat, red wine and malty chocolate; fizzy in the mouth with lots of tobacco up front; wow, thats where it is in terms of freshness as I got very little in the batch 73; texture is more creamy and complex; a little bit of heat with dry malty sweetness; damn good; reminds me a batch 73 a few months back and based on tonight, maybe fresh is where my sweet spot is with Adam; peaty, rich, oh yea; so tasty with rich malts, lots of sugars, mild peat, thick and creamy with dry finish; damn this beer is good

Batch 73 (Spring 2009)  4.2
12 oz. bottle; batch 73 (spring 2009); malty sugars, mild peat, fruit juicy and a little tobacco; drinks with thin mouthfeel; dried figs, yeasty sweetness, chocolate with a bone dry finish; tobacco and ash in the finish; kind of disappointing based on previous bottles of this batch;

Batch 43 (January 2000)  3.9
12 oz. bottle; batch 43 (January 2000); pours clear light brown with slight carbonation and trace off-white head along the edges; musky aromas of stale grain, some oxidation, chocolate and tobacco; thin, light texture with an almost tootsie roll kind of flavor; slightly oxidized and flavors have thinned over time; oxidation gives off an almost chocolaty aroma; dry and almost ashy finish; a little sticky with the thinned out malts; rich and sweet, but oxidation comes out more as it warms

Updated Rating 11/14/09 (4.3): 12 oz. bottle; fresh batch 76; ripe peat, yeast, chocolate and peat; crazy dry, sweet and smokey; while I think the wood beers are best fresh, this one sis a little rough; body hasnt quite settled down to the creamy richness of some previous vintages; wow, love trying this next to cherry adam, which is a bourbon bonanza; nothing quite like it, but I really think that batch 73 is the sweet spot 

Updated rating 9/29/09 (4.4): batch 73, fresh; figs, dates, bready yeast; earthy goodness with slight amount of heat; tons of figs and malty sugars; this beer rocks

Original Rating 10/14/07: 12 oz. bottle; massive tan head over dark brown body upon pouring; rich aromas of chocolate and malts with alcohol coming out nicely; equally rich flavors are a little bitter at first, but settling down well","Seattle, Washington, USA","SuzyGreenberg"

Update 11/2011: Sample of bottle nearly two years in my cellar. This beer really mellows out a lot after a couple years. Aroma is still the same. Still pretty intense with flavors of chocolate, roasted malt, and sweet malt. Mouthfeel is slightly smooth. I would only drink this beer after a few years of age on it. Now it will be interesting to see what it does from here.

UPDATE: 5/2014. Sample vintage 3 years old. Dark brown pour, touch of red. Big, lasting head, lacing. Aroma is sweet malt with hints of chocolate, coffee, booze; subtle but nice. Flavor is fairly intense sweet but with a strong balancing bitterness. Finishes with a long lingering flavor. This is still very intense after 3 years. Aging well, seems like it wants years more of cellaring. Brewer is known for inconsistency, which makes me wonder if this batch in more intense than others.

502,"2011-07-16",3.8,"Usually, complexity and quality go hand-in-hand when it comes to beer. Notice that I said usually, meaning they are not directly proportional to each other because if they were ""Adam"" by Hair of the Dog Brewing Company would be an outstanding beer. Its a barely wine with a tremendous amount of flavors - all of which are taken to the extreme. Its not a perfect, though, but a very impressive one.I split a 12oz bottle with a friend. We each poured ours into a small tasting glass.Appearance: Dark blackish/brown hue with dark blood red appearance along the bottom and edges. Forms a huge, tan, foamy head which is very slow to dissipate and even laces the glass. This is amazing considering the style of beer and its potency.Smell: Fruitcake, chocolate and smoke. Some alcohol presence as well. Taste: Some beers palates are subtle and mild, others hit you like a ton of bricks and the latter is definitely true of Adam. Ive often talked about my palate being slammed with hops, but in this case its smoke. Its a very strange sensation since the first half of the brew is rather traditional barleywine style with fruitcake flavors, dark fruits like cherry and fig, with distinct dark chocolate through the middle. But the finish has the subtlety of a sledgehammer and overwhelms my palate with smoke. Not being a cigar or tobacco connoisseur I cant accurately compare it to something other than to say its like a very fine tobacco with a honey glaze finish.As I drink on the beer begins to get richer and more sweet, with a distinct cherry syrup-like taste. The chocolate, fruits and smoke eventually homogenize and make for a robust palate. The only thing is, all these flavor individually are great, but together they are monstrous. Its definitely an impressive palate considering how unique the flavors are, and the fact the brewers made all these flavors work together, but as a whole it is not especially delicious. I have a feeling only seasoned beer drinkers will be able to appreciate the palate here.Mouthfeel: By far the thickest and fizziest beer Ive ever encountered. The head is akin to that of a sodas and the palate is quite peppery.Drinkability: Between the intensity of the palate, the lively mouthfeel and 10% ABV, Adam is a huge beer and difficult to drink in anything more than sips. Im glad I split a 12oz bottle with a friend because the 6oz alone was enough to satisfy me. Overall, this is one of the most interesting beers Ive ever drank. I wish the taste was more in tune to my liking, but its still a very good beer nevertheless.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

The first smell is very dark and mysterious, with chewy dark fruits, chocolate, dark caramels, and almost a slight hint of blackstrap molasses. There was a bit of rusty metal at first, but it was pretty volatile and dissipated quickly.

The taste is outrageously complex, with raisins, chocolate, prunes, and tobacco. Its sweet, but not cloying and the rich mouthfeel of this beer really helps balance out the high alcohol on it.

this beer had a dark brown pour that is opaque (I saw through the edges as I drank, it was a dark red and brown color), this beer did not make a head, just a lot of clear bubbles that were larger than normal, sort of like how a beers pours when the bottle has sat around a bit and the carbonation is gone, just a ring on top of the beer, there were a few tiny bubbles at the sides of the glass, swirling the glass did nothing to make a head or cover, there was a layer of dark sediment on the bottom of the bottle, 
this beer looked a little thick in the glass, but! some fine bubbles appeared in the glass and gave a little cover as it warmed (hmmm?), 

there  were aromas of chocolate, toasted malt, dark fruit  raisin with some nut fragrances, hints of smoke and woody smoke, 
dark malt and dark bread sweetness, and brown sugar sweetness, 

a lot of malt flavor, dark and toasted malt, chocolate, dark bread and brown sugar sweetness, some alcohol phenols and smoke in the background, 
the smoke flavor continues throughout the drink which was very nice, the finish was dry on the palate with a little malt flavor trailing, 

mouth feel was more than medium with a little stickiness on the palate, a little alcohol warmth felt on the palate but nothing to take away from the enjoyment of this drink, 

a beer with big and nice aromas and flavors, I found the aromas were more varied and a little better than the flavor, this is a nice Winter Warmer beer.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

502,"2011-04-14",3.8,"Reviewed from notes.

Served in a snifter. The initial pour is quite dark. A nice deepened shade of mahogany with a thin tan head and not too much lacing. Maybe a few legs here and there when held up to the light. The nose is very complex with some roast, tobacco, smoke, dark fruits, a bit of booze, and some nice malt.

The taste is not quite as complex and leans a bit too heavily on the tobacco and earth notes, but its still quite nice. Really good flavors accompanying what was found in the nose plus a bit of brown sugar and dark molasses. Nice feel with a bit of booze. Good body and carbonation. The drinkability is affected by the fact that I think theres a bit too much tobacco character, but overall this is a really nice beer.

The taste is very much of the same, starting with a bitter hoppy front and some malty roasted barley mixed in. It then transitions into dark fruits and a slight alcohol finish. This beer is velvetly smooth, a very well balanced ale.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Dfonorow"
502,"2010-12-27",4.5,"Bottle, batch #78, courtesy of SuzyGreenberg.  It pours deep, dark garnet red, dark brown in the glass, with a small, creamy latte-colored head.  As the head dissipates, it leaves thick lacing on the side of my glass.  A few pieces of tan sediment slowly settle to the bottom of the glass, sharply contrasting with the dark beer.  The aromas are sugary plum, raisin, figs, leather, cocoa, a touch of alcohol, cherry, and some smoky wood.  The flavor is tanned leather, sugary plum and fig, smoke, aged meat, and cocoa.  Sugary fruit and slightly bitter pine resin are present in the finish, and the aftertaste is leather.  The mouthfeel is thick, rich, creamy, and warming, with very little carbonation.  This is simply a silky, luxurious beer.  Incredible, and absolutely stunning.  A huge thanks to Ben for this one!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","Boliv"
502,"2010-12-27",4.7,"12 oz. bottle from Delocks Liquor in Munster, IN (batch 77).  Cola-like brown pour with a creamy off-white head.  Strong whiskey-like aroma that quickly fades and the other subtleties of the aroma are detected: milk chocolate, hints of licorice, and brief notes of smoke.  The flavor is absolutely stunning.  Smoky wood dominates but chocolate and dark fruit are easily detectable.  The alcohol is noticeable and quite welcome.  Totally unique and worthy of its praise.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","zizzybalubba"
502,"2010-12-26",3.7,"12oz bottle batch 43, merry xmas to me.  I have had many batches of Adam over the years both draft and bottle, so I suppose I should start rating them and takes notes here.  Bottle bought at bottleworks cellar sale this year.  I thought that it was a new batch number for me, but realized when I got home that I already had a 43 in the cellar so guess I should try one now.  Bottle opens with a little carb hiss and pours a very dark walnut brown with some sign of carb in the form of a few big loose bubbles around the edges.  First aroma that fills the air is big sherry notes.  As I let this warm and open a bit in the glass, the complexity that is Adam comes out.  Sweet prune with some grape notes up front, leather, peat, tobacco, signs of wet cardboard...but it is working for me in all that is going on in the nose, with some faint chocolate malt.  Mouth feel is just a bit lighter than other batches I have had and carb is there but faint.  Up front is big on the dark skin pitted fruit, cherry, prune, some fig notes, moves into sherry and then leather with the tartness lingering,  Waiting for it to come together in the end but doesnt quit get there.  Some tobacco and peat come in and gives it some bittering but the tart dark fruit notes stay.  Not sure if it was the handling, the age, the batch itself, but this wasnt the best Adam I have ever had.  That being said, I still love this beer and will continue to buy many bottles per batch and continue to try aged ones ton learn more about the changes this beer can go through over time.  I will rate based on this bottle but adjust as I have other batches.  (8,4,7,3,15  3.7) 12/26/10","Washington, USA","bvc"

502,"2010-12-18",4.1,"12oz. Bottle. Batch 78.  Almost looks like a stout in the glass with a dark brown color that borders on black with virtually no head.  Dungeon aroma with notes of leather, smoke and charred fruits.  Huge smokey taste with dried raisins, dates, figs and black currant flavor.  Surprisingly it even has some smoked bacon character and if I didnt know better Id swear that a little Belgian yeast was used somewhere as this has characteristics of a Belgian Quad style.  Warming finish with some sweetness that has hints of chocolate and overly ripe fruit.  Called a ""historic"" style, Id like to believe that in some ancient time people were enjoying a beer of this caliber, but I doubt it.  This one is a beast!","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"

Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a Massive foamy light tan head that has decent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting ring. Sporadic chunks of soapy lacing left behind.

Smokey roasted malt aroma with hints of leather, dark fruit, chocolate, coffee bean, licorice and sweet alcohol.

Medium bodied and excellently balanced with nice roasted chocolate maltiness, sweet alcohol, candy sugar and sligh dark fruit. Hints of raisin, fig, plum and dark cherry with a slightly bitter, war finish. Although their is some heat the high ABV is excellently masked, making this beer extremely quaffable.

502,"2010-11-20",5.0,"UPDATED: JUL 3, 2012 Deep, clear caramel colored pour with a thick and creamy enduring head nearly a half an inch thick.

Immensely complex aroma of pralines and cream, butterscotch, toffee, grapes, cherries, vanilla, wood, smoke, coffee ice cream (Haggen Dasz), rum, Drambuie and raisins.

Flavor is similar, with the addition of plum, and fig, but the leathery character really emerges, and subtly integrated smoke appears, and vanishes, only to return in the tremendously long finish.

There are plenty of earthy interwoven hops to somewhat dry out the finish, although this is definitely sweeter than it is bitter. The carbonation is extremely soft on the palate, and the texture is creamy, but not really chewy, more like silky.

Adam reminds me of an even more complex Rochefort 10, and Im really glad Ive finally returned to it after too many years of ignoring this masterpiece. Thanks for the early snowfall, Bellingham, I couldnt think of a finer liquid companion!

Just sipping a bottle from batch 84, and Ive noticed that there is more peat, (particularly in the nose), and also more leather in the finish.

The body is also verging and chewy, as opposed to just creamy and silky.

I view all three of these differences as improvements, and I think its now worthy of a five overall.

Simply incredible ale.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Caskalefan"

The flavor is very complex with smoke, wood, leather, nuts, roasted malt, dark fruit like figs and some belgian like yeast qualities. The body is full with a nice creamy mouthfeel.

It poured very dark - probably black, and had minimal/vanishing head.  The flavor/aroma was very sweet- it reminded me of an underattenuated scotch ale a brewed with a lot of crystal malt.  So its very sweet and smokey with a bit of chocolate roasted notes underneath that.  Thats what stood out, there may have been hop bitterness, but not much in the way of flavor.

502,"2010-11-08",4.9,"Batch 78 thanks to AlFrantzell.

Wow.  Pours with a surprisingly firm, if small, amount of head and some lasting wispy top and lacing.  Theres so much going on in the nose that I cant even put it all into words.  Tobacco, leather, smoke, chocolate, rich rum raisins, my goodness.  The taste follows through on the promise of the nose and adds a beautiful little wrinkle that makes this beer taste absolutely unbelievable: citrus hops in the finish.  So nuanced, so flavorful, so, so, so good.

Before Id ever tried any of their products, I didnt really understand what HotD was about.  The bottles were fairly expensive, and the reviews on BA were good but not unbelievable.  Then I tried Ruth, and that beer was a very solid pale ale.  Then I tried Cherry Adam.  That beer is tasty but a bit on the sweet side and harder to finish.  Then I got a hold of two bottles of Adam.  My life is forever changed; I have a new brewery to buy up whenever I see their beers, and possibly an all-time favorite for the colder months.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"

Pours somewhere between brown and black...with a little Grimace purple thrown in.  Absolutely no head, lacing or carbonation whatsoever... bad bottle?  Aroma of alcohol, chocolate, licorice, licorice, licorice and purple drank.  Mouthfeel was very syrupy, but not that thick, due to the lack of carbonation.  Taste was actually, exactly as described on the bottle, leather, smoke, dark fruit, alcohol (a lot).  Like an old British hunting club squeezed into a bottle.  I really didnt like it.

Leather, smoke, again a rather up front yeast component, the roast on this one is rather large, some dark dried fruits, figs, dates, roasted nuts, a long after taste in the back of the mouth with a mix of leather, burnt caramel and coffee.

There is a nice spicy/bitter finish that makes things interesting, and the mouthfeel is nice and thick but smooth.

502,"2010-01-11",4.3,"Reddish brown with a pretty big, almost fluffy, head that fizzes away into some lacings.

The smell is fantastic. Very complex, dont even know if Im able to decipher everything going on here. Heres a lot of malts - caramel, dark bread, fudge and even some roasted notes. Vinous fruits (cherries, raisins, figs) and wood. Spices reminiscent of cola, molasses and smooth alcohol notes.

The taste is no letdown either, to say the least. A gentle roasted character sits well with caramel, fudge and prominent vinous fruity notes. The fruits are not as well defined as in the smell. Then comes rich and sophisticated flavors of wood, raisins, dusty cellar and spices. The taste is very sweet but the roasted aromas, wood and spices keep everything on track. The finish is amazing. Luscious warming and semi-sweet alcohol, well balanced bitterness, leafy hops, wood and lingering sweetness. Very powerful. If I had to say something negative about it, I think the alcohol is just slightly too prominent. But thats of minor importance.

Medium to full body and creamy texture. Very pleasant.

This is just a fantastic beer. Very complex and oh so balanced. Drinks like a fine wine.

Aroma: Interesting nose, that includes notes of chocolate, smoke, roasted malts, alcohol, and dark fruits (plum)

Appearance: Pours a dark brown color with a large beige head that leaves a lot of lace on the glass

Flavor: Taste is also quite nice, much of the same notes that are prevalent in the nose exist in the flavor as well, it is medium sweet, malty, and has a long bitter finish

Palate: The body is pretty full, some ABV is present, but beer is quite smooth for a beer of this magnitude

I found this beer to be pretty enjoyable overall.  I was impressed by pretty much the whole thing from start to finish.  A nice nose, a really nice flavor, a nice look, and a nice palate.

502,"2009-11-02",4.0,"Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle in a pub glass.  The beer pours an opaque deep brown with a nearly sold tan head that lasts the twenty minutes it took to enjoy the entirety of the beer.  Notes of milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, and port-like characters come through in the strong nose that is noticeable from several feet away.  The palate is decadently rich, showing a full malty character that almost tastes like drinking liquified German chocolate.  Tremendous notes of milk/dark chocolate and caramel.  The only detractor to the palate was a tremendous residual sweetness.  In a way, I think this is forgivable, given the traditional aim of the beer; harkening back to a time when beers paired higher starting and finishing gravities.  However, the beer was a bit difficult to consume in the middle of a fairly heavy drinking session.  It would be far better as a digestif or a night-cap.

Crazy deep chocolate, tobacco, dates/fig, sherry, spice.  In some weird way, it reminded me of my grandmas pecan pie. Thick body coats the mouth, keeping the alcohol burn with you long after the sip. My experience was marred slightly by the haste in which I had to finish it, and it really got to be overwhelming by the end of the glass. This could be the perfect beer for splitting with a good friend on a cold night.","Williamston, Michigan, USA","sleestak"

Fucking fantastic aroma.  I dont even care.  You dont like this, your brain is wired wrong.  I think there is a touch of smoke.  I know this is at least 2 years old because Ive had it that long, but a definite date is unknown.  Strangely, it doesnt smell old.  Usually aged beer has this quality about it I am beginning to dislike, but this beer tells time itself to piss off.  The flavor is unfamiliar at first.  A strange sensation.  Perhaps thats the leather they mention on the bottle.  Some chocolate breaks though moments later.  The flavor lingers.  Chewy.  Thick.  Coating.  Holy fracking shat I love this beer.  If I could have a case of anything I wanted, this is the beer.  Its like an imperial stout but, its not one.  Its better than most of them.  Its a serious, beer that means business.

Aroma of sweet malts, molasses, apple and dark fruits, and a bunch of other stuff.  Flavors of campfire smokiness, plums, and very dark chocolate and coffee together -- quite like a dark chocolate covered espresso bean.

502,"2009-06-27",4.2,"Bottle, $4.99 in CA.  Pours dark brown with almost no head.  Aroma is strong of dates, raisin, smoke, and wood.  Really intruiging.  Flavor contains so many different flavor components, its hard to describe.  One thing is certain, this is a sipper  and a slow one at that  allowing for proper contemplation of this beer.  Flavor starts with initial notes of red grapes, dates and prunes.  A lot of dark, dried fruit in there.  But through the middle, Adam throws more compelling elements into the mix:  smoke and peat.  Simultaneously, Adam in his full glory is smoky, woody, peaty, even musty, all complementing the dark fruit gracefully.  Perceptually, I grew fond of thinking of this beer as musty, dried fruit. Finally, as all great higher ABV beers do, Adam utilizes the alcohol as a flavor and mouthfeel element, warming your chest as it settles smoothly down your throat.  The finish remains fruit-sweet, but with so much more.  Hardly a trace of carbonation here. Takes some getting used to, but my goodness what a flavor!","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

Aroma of soy sauce, some sort of dark fruit, maybe a bit of molasses and cocoa. Flavor is fairly complex: initial hint of chocolate quickly changes to soy sauce, malt, and dark fruit. Slightly warming sensation on the palate and the nose from the alcohol. A bit more bitter bourbon aftertaste as it warms. This drinks like a porter and finishes like a barley wine.

502,"2009-06-12",4.3,"Batch number 74 found at Wine Expo in Santa Monica - thanks to the guy at the store for letting me know about it. Poured deep deep brown, not quite black, almost opaque, with a thin tan head and little in terms of lacing. Powerful aromas of coca, licorice, figs, caramel, and a very subtle sense of citusy hops. Heavy malt flavors, highlighted by bittersweet chocolate, figs, dark cherries, and smoke. Alcohol is unmistakeable, but warming, not harsh. Smooth, very creamy mouthfeel, full bodied, lightly carbonated, and a very nice sweet malty aftertaste.","Pacific Palisades, California, USA","RedSox2004"
502,"2009-06-11",3.5,"12 oz from a trade with kersta8.  Thanks!  Pours a dark cola brown with a tan head.  Nose is smoke, band-aid, roast, spice, hops, and a bit of sweetness aching to emerge.  Flavor is an enigma: lots of fire and smoke, but spice, hops, and a dark fruit/ dark sweetness are camping out somewhere in the flavor profile.  This beer is a bit puzzling- smoke/ fire up front, malty sweet mid, and finishing with smoke.  Deep beer- one that requires more than a chug to get to know.  Tiny bit of lace and a band aid on my tongue are all this beer leaves.  Medium bodied and interesting.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

502,"2009-05-26",3.8,"Batch 73 bottle.
Appearance  WOW. Here is a prime example of a HotD brew: I poured a little too aggressively, and so in my Deschutes tulip pint there sits about 5 oz. of Adam and the rest of the glass filled with chunky, rocky, off white creamy head. This head is going nowhere, it has been 5 minutes and that head has damn near subsided 0%. Bottle-conditioning, oh how I love you! The beer itself is a dark brown with ruby reddish brown edges. This is awesome. 

Smell  Dark fruits, lots of figs, leather, smoke, even some oaky scents. 

Taste  Lots of smoke and oak. This tastes like I am drinking a camp fire. The taste is a lot like the smell, yet a lot sweeter. Sweet malty goodness; this thing is a malt bomb from hell. The alcohol is definitely present in this young example too.

Mouthfeel  This isnt too thick at all, but it still manages to linger on your tongue and remind you exactly what you are drinking long after taking a sip. 

Drinkability  This is actually pretty difficult to drink. The flavors are so intense and in your face it really hits you hard. I am sure this will mellow very well over time and become an extremely awesome beer with complexity that is rivaled by close to none. I am guessing this would go great with a real campfire on a cold Eastern Oregon night.","Salem, Oregon, USA","josephselander"

Aromas are decent enough... a bit of brown sugar and leather, a touch of fruit and a whiff of pine from time to time.  Maybe there is something wrong with me, but I was expecting this to be a little more transcendental... dont get me wrong, this is very good... still...  Anyhow, the chocolate is definitely there, with a little bit of piney hops in the finish.  It is pretty mellow in between, though.

The leather and smoke stick around the palate for a while. Its a wacky mix. Flavor is robust, and robust is good, but the smoke overpowers. I cant get Liquid Smoke (the highly concentrated stuff you add to meat marinades) out of my mind. Palate is creamy, chewy, good.

pours deep ruby, dark still and close to no head, only few remnants of tan head. Left some nice transparent lacing.
Aroma malty, with chocolate, dark fruits (fig) very light notes of smoke and the alcohol that is very present.
Taste was amazing, lots of dark fruits (figs), notes of wood barrel, malts and plenty of molasses, cocoa nibs. Plenty of licorice, for a sticky sugary palate.
Warming alcohol coupled with the dark fruits and  notes of smoke that just coat the palate.

Only disappointment that prevented me from rating it higher was the very low carbonation. I opened the bottle and heard a very faint puff of air leaving the beer to have an overall still mouthfeel.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

502,"2009-01-25",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2010 Bottle at Blue Palms.  Batch 70.  Near black pour with absolutely no head or carbonation -- bad bottle?  Never seen a beer this flat other than some homebrew bottles that I forgot to bottle condition.  This thing was an overly sweet malt bomb; however, there were lots of redeeming qualities behind all the malt sugar.  Very chocolaty,  With all the sweet dark malt, there is a hint of soy, which is off-putting.  Overall: way way over hyped; not terrible but not great by any means.  BUT, maybe I had a bad bottle... are all of them this flat?

[RE-RATE] up from 3.2

Bottle [batch 77].  Pours black with a creamy mocha colored head.  The aroma is roasty and smokey with vanilla, molasses, and musty chocolate.  The flavor is the same.  The roasty chocolate quality makes this more akin to a porter or stout.  Not many fruit notes here.  A bit of dark fruits on the finish, maybe plumbs?  The alcohol is hidden very well, but is nice and warming in the stomach.  Some hops shine through the finish, which is medium dry.  It is full bodied and silky smooth and coating on the palateperfect.  Overall: this is just a damn impressive beer.  I am not really into the big beers these days, but this thing is flawless.  If I had it blind, I certainly wouldnt call it an old ale, but to each brewer their own.  It has lots of porter and stout qualities, but I still wouldnt call it a porter or stout either in that it lacks the toasted bitternesshard to put my finger on it really.  This is a much different beer from the last time I had it must have been a bad batch back then.  I;m glad I revisited this one.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

502,"2009-01-15",3.7,"My Hair of the Dog Adam is a potential dud.  The cap pops, and the bottle exhales a tired, shallow sigh.  The carbonation meekly files out of its high pressure prison, tiredly limping towards the edges of the glass, moping as it skates along the murky, oak body.  The aroma is a little more vibrant, dripping with chocolate, peat, coffee, and a touch of raspberry, auguring a rich and dessert-like brew.  I gird myself for an oily, decadent flavor, and get it in spades.  Its strong, even burly, slowly trudging forth with the peat and coffee flavors, and then adding a layer of sweet, dark chocolate and raspberry, just like the aroma.  I also catch a much needed dollop of honey sweetness, which helps to offset a somewhat overpowering bitterness.  The chocolate flavors are also, at times, overbearing, suggesting malts that may have been excessively kilned.  This is definitely a flavorful, pungent beer, but its a bit too strong and forward for my palate.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Shared by MilkmanDan who has kept it cellared for many years now, thanks a lot. I felt this was a good way to final enter a rating for Adam.  Pours with a bit of a bubbly head.  Of course its thick and dark and one cannot see through it. Aroma is strong maltiness with light present alcohol and light cardboard showing its age.  Lots of delicious prune as well though.  A bit of a woodsy (similar to scotch ale) feel to it. Taste is smooth with no age .  Has a bit of black tea and lightly smokey phenolics (this may actually be an off flavor of age but works well here).  Finishes light with just a hint of bread-y malts. Still doing fine but I think this problem has seen its peak.  Ill enter future ratings to get a better picture of the beer.  I prefer the fresher version to one that is this old.

Re-rate: fresh bottle, batch 72.  Pours with a thick off white head.  Aroma is surprisingly hoppy, I do not remember it being this hoppy, but this may be the freshest I have ever had it.

Fresh, piney hop hides in the aftertaste to finish rounding it off. Full bodied and very smooth, this would be perfect for cold autumn days, though its still great even at 75F and 90% humidity.

Batch #43 thanks to the Cleveland crew. Double-fisted this with Darkness 08, and there is no comparison. At nearly 9.5 years, this is amazingly complex. The sugary chocolate malts and fruit have been preserved, but the hops are replaced by an amazing smoke quality, nearing an Islay single malt, probably Ardbeg given the smoke strength.

502,"2008-06-15",3.7,"12oz bottle from BOLTZ7555, thanks big time Jason!  you the man!  Aroma has notes of smoke, leather, currant, latakia pipe tobacco, musty dried fruit.  Very deep amber black with an average sized frothy khaki head that lasted and left some lace.  Flavor of smoke, leather, currant and finishes quite bitter.  Palate is lively and full bodied with a lingering finish.  A good brew thats rustic and earthy.  Desert beer my ass though, nothing about this brew suggests dessert, more like warming oneself by an outdoor fire.","Saginaw, Michigan, USA","polomagnifico"
502,"2008-06-14",4.5,"Dark dark amber near black. Aroma of dried prunes, cherries and malt. Sweet taste that is smokey and reminds me of dried fruit bread. Smokey dry finish. Really different and quite wonderful. The guy where I bought this told me he had one that was aged for 8 years and it tasted like a milkshake. We shall see.","Orange, California, USA","kegbear"

502,"2008-06-07",3.9,"Pours a dark brown, for sure, but mine showed little to no head. I poured into another glass and back just to be sure - minimal head. Aroma is hearty, roasty sweet malts, chocolate, oak and cherry. Nice! Flavor is fantastic, even though Im not usually a fan of smokey beers (porters, etc.) - its big and thick, smokey and - like they say - hearty. Finishes dry, but sticky. Somewhat like Old Viscosity, but with more to it. The smoke almost tastes like smoked meats. Im usually not a fan of beers that dont have enough bitterness to balance out the sweetness, but this one seems to pull it off nicely. Wish I could try Dave...","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

Its such a bold brew.  I can taste alcohol, a mix of spices that are hard to identify, and a smooth malt hop aftertaste.  There are some dark fruit flavors in the middle with some smokey and chocolate flavors mixed in.  Its a very complex brew that I need to get more of to allow time to age.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"
502,"2008-05-20",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 2, 2011 Batch 70. Pours with a large, creamy thick, light brown head. Ultra dark brown body. Outstanding ""ring per sip"" lacing. Great retention. Aroma is flowery with spices, chocolate, bourbon, molasses, pitted fruits and some leather. Taste is of chocolate malts, spiciness, a bit of alcohol, and smoke. There is a little bit of chewing tobacco in the aftertaste. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. For some reason this beer reminds me of Old Viscosity. Creamy mouth and playful bubbles. Have since tried batch 67 in May 2009. This beer ages well and gains tons of complexity.  Im sad to report that the Batch 79 that I just had is totally flat which kills the beer a bit.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
502,"2008-05-19",4.1,"Batch 70. Dense black, hefty tan head. Aroma of leather, floral and pine hops, smokey bourbon notes, dark fruits, some chocolate. Taste is chocolate, molasses, smoke, slight sweetness on the sides of the tongue. A little alcohol up the nose. Crushingly huge citrus/pine hop finish with lingering bitterness. For such a big beer, it had a remarkable amount of carbonation, full-bodied and finished dry. It hardly betrayed its strength. Fantastic beer, though I think I would enjoy this more with some age on it to smooth things out.","San Francisco, California, USA","cmillward"

502,"2008-05-17",3.8,"Okay, I need to step back and take my time rating this one.  From the bottle its a little too cold, I should let it rest for a while.  The pour showcases a rich dark almost black color and a huge frothy tan head that is still lingering several minutes after the pour.  The aroma is sweet and slightly alcoholic.  Taste is harsh - heavy on the smoke and charred taste.  Not as sweet as I was expecting from the aroma, but subtly there at the back end.  Man this one is try.  There is a lingering burnt flavor on my palate and Im finding myself craving more sweet.  There is a strong bitter finish that I have a hard time connecting to the hops, but I guess thats what is making it so.

Well, in conclusion I guess this is well crafted, but just not my style.  Im impressed at how well hidden the alcohol is, but Id like a more rounded flavor rather than just the smoky burnt flavor.","State College, Pennsylvania, USA","can8ianben"

502,"2008-05-15",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 8, 2012 [Fresh 2008 bottle for later comparison (batch 70 I think) 5.15.08] Pours a very dark brown with a large frothy creamy beige head. The head leaves some amazing lacing.  What an aroma! Smokey peat, brown sugar and pineapple? with lesser notes of dark fruit, licorice.  Funky flavor, smokey, plums, pineapples, bacon, rich brown sugar, alcohol, whiskey, chocolate.... etc etc etc...  Very warming.  Body is creamy at first than becomes fluffy and airy.  Crazy beer and I cant wait to age it! The finish is bitter and strangely tannic... age should cure this.  Should be amazing when the carbonation dies down and all those flavors meld together. 9.5.9.4.17 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . [Batch 73 rated 3.4.10]  Pours very fizzy, huge fluffy rootbeer float like head, Aroma of sweet juicy pineapple, smokey grassy, I suppose like peat, brown sugar, dry chocolate, touch of oxidation/leather and flowers.  Flavor follows, some leather upfront, but quickly washed away by the wonderful rich smokey molasses sweetness, dry fruits, love the richness, touch of pineapple in the finish/aftertaste, which is absolutely wonderful, always love the combination of rich and warmth from the alcohol.  Long chocolate and bitter aftertaste, odd combination, makes it a bit floral.  Medium bodied, full mouthful, lively active carbonation, very fluffy, a bit too much so.  So freaking good. Lingering medicinal bitter cherry aftertaste, quite resinous and bitter piney now that I think about it through the malt depth.  Had to give my mouth a little rest and let my buds reset, now Im getting pumpernickel and raisin in both the aroma and flavor.  Most certainly a different animal once its decanted a while and the carbonation has died considerable, flavors just keep changing.  O wow thats crazy, I capped half the bottle and kept it in the fridge while taking my sweet time to drink the decanted half, so now I opened the 2nd corked half and poured it, sure enough back to all that carbonation and the flavor is back to how it tasted before decanting, a cool way to instantly compare what an hour of air does, the flavor was sharply rich, sweet brown sugar and pineapple again, fizzy carbonation, I cant decide how I like it better, but its always awesome when a beer can be such a chameleon.  

9.5.9.4.17 . . . . . . . . . . . [batch 74 (had two of these so far I think) rated 7.22.10]  Much the same, plum, smoke, leather, citrus, pineapple, nuts, roast, molasses, cherry, who knows what else... yikes...  Body definitely seems fuller, not really much carbonation, its much softer, not as aggressive as in the other bottles, more creamy for sure, more in line with a dessert beer for sure but Im not sure that I like it as much, definitely emphasizes the richness.  Lots of rich tootsie-roll chocolate.  . . . . . . .[70, 7/8/12]  perfect timing, great fluffy body, oxidation is complementary, chocolate, cherry, raisin, fig, light smoke, less leather than before.  really fucking nice.  9.5.10.5.18, unreal]","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

502,"2008-04-29",4.3,"Wowzers! This guy just exploded out of the bottle with a 3+ finger off white head that threatened to overflow the snifter. The head literally stayed nearly one finger thick the entirety of the session and left some serious lacing. Pours black with only the slightest hint of deep mahogany tints around the edges. Beautiful if not slightly out of control.  Big whiffs of dark sweet malts with caramel, toffee and chocolate scents. Dark fruits in there as well, figs, plums and raisins maybe. Slight smoky smell throughout.  Massive and complex with a whole lot going on. First taste of dark malts, molasses, chocolate and dark fruits. Caramel and toffee flavors are also evident but all the sweetness is balanced by the strong hop profile, mainly piney, resinous hops. There is also the smoky backbone that weaves itself in and out of the taste. Borders on taste bud overload. Like the appearance...tasty if not slightly out of control.  Thick, creamy mouthfeel coats the mouth but lingers with a slight hop bitterness and the stinging of the alcohol.  Wow, Im not sure I could have more than a couple of these in a week or so. Massive beer all the way around and the sensory assault just slightly takes away from the drinkability. Despite that, I will actively seek out other HoD brews after this baptism by fire.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

502,"2008-04-26",3.2,"A- This is how a beer should look. Murky reddish black with a tan 2 finger head which stays for a while and leaves a crapload of lacing as it goes down.

S- Smell is strangely absent, a bit of roasted malt, cant detect much else.

T- Starts off deep and malty, the roasted malts take front stage but behind them is definitely a complex malt bill. This leads into a hoppiness that seems a little too strong, probably with time this one will lose most of the hops and really shine with the malts, I suspect it is a little young. Slight alcohol notes at the end. The main beef I have with this one is it just doesnt taste like an old ale which was what I wanted. Not bad, just not my cup of tea.

M- Medium viscosity, lots of carbonation. I assume the carbonation will fade with time.

D- This one is a nice beer to sip on. I think I would give it at least a year or two in the future. Seems like an old ale and a stout mixed to me but what do I know.","California, USA","Lothore"

As the head falls down, smoke shows up, a touch of rauchbier bacon, with tar and licorice. Flavour is relatively sweet, complex and unusual. All the best notes of a good dark barleywine, with a little smoke character added. Its bordering on cloying sweet, but it ends on a dry note with lingering tar and licorice.

502,"2008-03-17",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2008 Batch 69; pours to a deep obsidian with cherry wood shading, topped by a monstrous, succulent head.  Aromas of currants, plums, blackberry and oak.  Immense sweetness.  The flavor follows suit, hinting of so many red wines, port, and butterscotch.  Monstrous viscosity coats the mouth in a slow, delicate caress.  Gently powerful with incredible finesse.  A classy example of what a fine aperterif can be. 8/4/8/4/16 4 
Batch 63; pours with exuberance and attitude to a thickly foamed appearance of robust chocolate brown.  Mousse everywhere forming pillowy croppings atop the density.  Aroma is gentle and erudite, unfolding and washing in and out like a slow, flooding tide; pure, rustic cocoa, pineapple, floral honey, and oranges in the intial burst of earthy sweetness.  Roasted hazelnuts and bonfire smoke; deep and muscular.  Minerals, fresh mint, and a light bodied tobacco ash; heat of port, some plum and tannin.  Dusty, basement-kept, woodsy, robust, and through all thoroughly polished.  Delicately mind blowing.  Flavors have met each other at a comfortable place and settled.  Burly chocolate, roasted nuts, plum and rich tobacco make up the earth, canopied beneath a brandy and port haze, and decorated with the foliage of orange, distant lime juice, blackberry, and pineapple.  Doughy mid palate gives cinnamon bread, mayan chocolate, and a mildly uncomfortable ashiness which skirts away into leather and rich molasses.  Palate is sparkly and full to the very brim; monstrous and velvety.  Finish is dank and dark, with a malty wetness of toffee and burnt caramel sinking in as a watercolor landscape; indefinite, deftly restrained, and ponder-able.  Conjures visions of old world artistry in a most authentic and unbelievable way.  Amazing; a sheer revolution of complexity. 10/5/8/4/19 4.5      

Revisiting batch 63 already, with an english pipe tobacco.  Fig and butterscotch apple in a tangier aroma; nutmeg, chocolate, cinnamon, alcohol.  Seems generally more ebullient and restive than the calm, erudite reservation of the last sample.  The smoke changes it, definitely, but not for worse or for better.  Gloriously robust bright melon, vinous fruit and deep malt flavor unaffected, aside from the slightly off kilter ring of the aroma.

502,"2008-03-15",4.6,"Thanks to Brian for this one.  Batch 69.  Pours a dark brown body with a thick, creamy tan head that lingers a while before it is reduced to a film of bubbles resting atop the body.  The aroma is a sweet, warm caramel, woody or nutty, with a layer of tobacco.  The flavor is a touch dry at the front, then sweet, metallic, figs, more tobacco, chocolate, and smoke.  Quite a complex and amazing flavor that I have only begun to describe.  The body is delicate but full, with plenty of effervescence.  Bravo.","Lexington Park, Maryland, USA","wickedpete"
502,"2008-03-13",4.3,"12 oz bottle from Bev4less in Santee. The label says this is batch 70. Pours an opaque dark black-brown color with a big clumpy tan head that lasts and lasts. The aroma is medium in strength with candied plums, cherries, banana and almonds. The flavor is complex, but hard to nail down, there are dark fruits, some leather, a bit of tobacco, dark chocolate and roasted malts. The mouthfeel is light and creamy. The finish is long with a lingering biter hops presence. Overall: this is one finely crafted beer--the kind of beer I would like to brew if I owned a brewery. Highly recommended.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"

502,"2008-03-08",4.5,"12 oz bottle that gushes upon opening, which caused me to spill some on my pants.  pours the darkest nearly opaque brown, through which a hint of red shows when lighted from behind.  the dense yet fluffy light tan head slowly fades to a film, and leaves thick sheets of lacing all over the glass.  light notes of roasted and chocolate malts waft from the glass, but with much more of a woody note than one gets from a stout.  there is also a fairly assertive note of bananas as well as just the slightest hint of alcohol.  tastes of light smokey fudge and black cherries abound, as well as dark overripe fruits, and some more hints of wood.  the finish is delightful!  a sweetness that somehow manages to be sharp but not assertive mixes with a light but lingering bitterness.  there is a great warming sensation, perfect for this cold winter evening.  and the mouthfeel is so light and airy; i cant remember having a beer that felt this creamy.  medium to full body, but its so light in the mouth that its hard to tell.  tons of carbonation, as evidenced by the way it nearly shot out of the bottle, but the bubbles are all so tiny, and go right into that airy creamy mouthfeel.  an amazing beer on all levels!","pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","hiddenvariable"

502,"2008-02-19",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2008 Update 11/18/08: Bottle, batch 70. Pours dark brown with no head. Aroma of cocoa powder, apple skins, yeast, and a light fruitiness. Flavor of dark and light fruits and light bitter chocolate/roastiness. Sweet and warming. Nice beer, very tasty.  I don’t know if the batch I had just wasn’t as tasty as the earlier one or if my palate has changed in the past year (more likely), but I just didn’t find this beer as awesome as I once did.


Original rating 2/19/08: I love this beer!  Pours dark black with a small, persistant, light colored head.  Aroma of light and dark fruits: apple, pear, raisin, fig.  Makes you think youre gonna drink a Belgian, but then you take a sip of it and its so rich and hearty.  Tastes of roastiness, chocolate, nuts, coffee, vanilla, earthiness.

502,"2008-02-18",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2012 Bolttle from Monument Liq in Concord.  Poured with immeasurable head and thick, black body.  When they talk about beers being a meal, this is definitely in that category.  This brew was strong from the second it hit my lips.  Tastes of chocolate, coffee, and woodsmoke were very apparent.  It beat down my lamb and potatoes dinner, and filled my mouth with roasted malt flavor.  Also, it had a nice, crisp finish for such a strong ale.  Not my favorite, but still very good.

Aroma of caramel, chocolate, light molasses, nuts and spices (pepper, vanilla), very light smokey, alcohol and phenol; complex, as the components shift and come in waves. Strong body structure, with a very strong dark chocolate flavor, perfectly complemented by the caramel and some malt, medium sweetness, but surpassed by the roasted malt bitterness, with hints of old wood, leather and liquorice; all this covers an excellent hopping. The final, powerful as well, and warming, has the character of dark chocolate and roasted nuts. Wonderful.<i>2007-08-27, 8-5-8-4-18=43</i>Dark chestnut color; huge, creamy head. Aroma of caramel, with a touch of vanilla wood and liquorice, some alcohol too. Powerful body, with an excellent mix of flavors, caramel over all, corrected by a dash of roasted malt, rubharb and liquorice; the final becomes more coffeish, with a reminder of toffee. The palate sees a struggle between the medium-high bitterness and the alcohol warmth. Very well brewed, a pleasure to drink. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
502,"2008-02-15",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2009 What a treat! Huge thanks to GMCC2181 for sending this one my way. Had no idea what to really expect, as ""Traditional Ale"" seems to be a catch-all category, but this one was awesome. Pours black with a slight purple hue. A head unlike anything Ive seen. The ""soft cotton-like"" description gunhaver left is spot on. The head filled up a third of the glass on the initial pour. Aroma is very fuitish; apples and plums, probably some peaches. Flavor is just as complex; light chocolate, caramel, dark fruit and slight candy. I chewed this one and it brought out more flavor. The alcohol is pretty apparent for a 10%, which is usually something I dont care for, but it actually suited this beer perfectly and I didnt mind it at all. A very warming beer, simply delicious. Had a little too much alcohol on the aftertaste (seperate from the flavor) and thats why the palate score is just a ""3"". Everything else is top notch.","Indiana, USA","StFun"
502,"2008-02-14",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2008 Bottle. Pours black with tons of tan carbonated soft cotton-like head. And it stays there, too. Never really settles down, but makes for pleasant theater. Prominent lacing remains on the glass. Really not sure what to expect here. Aroma is fresh raisins, apricot, peach, smoked meat. Very unique to say the least. Flavor is very different and throws a curve ball at your senses. Roasted coffee, toffee, caramel, smoky chocolate. The roasted taste and texture cant be stressed enough. It really envelops the entire brew and makes this beer something very unique and fascinating. Starts off sweet on the palate, but finishes dry. Alcohol is barely detected. Im not too sure what the brewers were going for, but I love it.","Tampa, Florida, USA","gunhaver"
502,"2008-02-11",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 8, 2010 Bottle from Pabobcat. Batch #63. I will first say that, perhaps because of the type of this brew, I was expecting a much different brew, and I am really blown away. Pours a deep purple that is close to black, with a thin off-white head. The aroma was really great; dark fruit and a musty earthiness. The taste is similar; plumb, raisins, dark cherries, and a earthy dry roasted malt. Utterly amazing. Unique and really well made. Batch 73 thanks to brewolf. A similar experience; simply amazing. Rich and fruity, smooth, lovely. Akin to a Imperial Stout with wild and aged flavors that defy modern notions of beer. A hearty old world ale indeed.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"

Huge frothy light brown head with darker amber swirls in the center. I chose to pour this one into a snifter despite the suggested glassware...and it payed off. Lovely aromatics going on; malty brown sugar, leather, slight tobacco and raisin. Flavor is a smoky blend of earthy chocolates, toffee, lots of plum and toasted bread. The finish is nicely bittered and leaves a strong roasted note to linger for a while. Warming alcohol is noticeable, but well balanced. Beautiful thick and chewy mouthfeel.

Pour was wonderfully dark with a foamy head that kept hanging around and that tried to climb out of the glass (nice lacing!).  Aroma was caramel, chocolate and roast as well as some dark fruits.  A smokiness surrounded all the flavors, but a pleasant smokiness.  The flavor was more of the same.  Wonderfully sweet, wonderfully complex.  It would have scored higher if there wasnt a flavor in the back end that reminded me of the adhesive on a band-aid.  Smooth mouthfeel.  Warming as it goes down the hatch.

Can taste the alcohol in this one but I was very impressed. My first HOTD beer and definitely not the last.","Virginia, USA","wj94"
502,"2008-01-26",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 11, 2008 Obtained at the Red in Santa Cruz. 

An aggressive pour into a snifter yields a nice head/beer ratio, the thick black liquid settling beneath a creamed coffee colored head of over 3 fingers. Head reduces to a cap that stays around forever, lacing is minimal. 

Aromas of brown sugar, chocolate, alcohol soaked dark fruits, brandy.

Flavors of dark roasted malt, fig, raisin, brandy, bakers chocolate, espresso, burnt prune. Finishes a bit bitter and boozy, but by no means is it overwhelming or distracting. Beautifully complex. 

The carbonation is so perfect that you dont even notice it. Roasted malt dries the finish nicely, but alcohol taints it a little. 

At 10% I could easily have another but no more than that. A bomber of this stuff would be perfect. Great beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

Nice dark brown with a huge overflowing tan head. Taste was many things blended together. Dark fruits (plum/raisin) are in the front with an almost vinous feel. Dark malt comes in and out as it warms. The aftertaste is very strong. Alcoholic a bit but almost a licorice like taste. Well carbonated which is a plus for me.

Once it finally settles down the head adds a creamy texture to the brew.  Aromas of liquorice, plum, and leather.  Mainly leather and plum though.  At first there is a smoky flavor that gives way to a red fruit and roasted malt flavor.  The finish is quite long with some sweetness and leaving a roasted malt flavor in your mouth for a while.

Smooth hookah-smoke tobacco, woody flavors, bittersweet cocoa, hints of fine port wine, touches of honey and perserved fruit. Some resiny hop lingers in the finish along with alcohol burn and woodsmoke. Extremely dense, full and creamy mouthfeel, lightly oily in the finish. Additional sweetness as it warms in the glass.

I didnt really get the smokiness or chocolate others have described.  Full bodied with a rich, almost silky mouthfeel.

502,"2007-12-30",4.5,"Pours a near black colour with a dense, creamy golden,  tan head that retains well, leaving a thin, but even coat of lacing. A rich, complex aroma eminates feet above the glass, with suggestions of milk chocolate, grapefruity hops, candied dark fruits, smoke n oak, toffee and some vinous, boozy notes.  The flavour is unexpected given the impression of sweetness hinted in the aroma, as the vinous, alcoholic notes are dominant in an initial shock. Bitter bakers cocoa, grahm cracker, espresso, star anise, smoke, tobacco and sweet dried fruits begin to exude their presense once getting over the initial shock of the booze and vinousness. The flavour profile is kind of like a chocolatey Rauchbier, which is awesome. The finish is extremely drying, leaving sticky sweet chocolatey malts and dry, bitter hops.

Mouthfeel started off very strong, nice small-bubble carbonation at the sides of the mouth, but got a bit thin toward the end of the bottle. Reminded me most of a Rochefort with a slightly lighter mouthfeel and less vinous. I firmly believe this beer deserves a spot in the top 50.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

502,"2007-11-25",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 12, 2010 Thick, nearly black pour with some deep crimson highlights.  A tall, foaming tan head sticks around for a good while, coating the glass with dense swaths of lacing along the way.  Scorched caramel, melted dark chocolate, smoke, and dried dark fruits comprise the malt base in the incredibly rich nose.  The use of relatively dry yeast and moderate earthen hops keeps it from smelling overly sweet.  Flavors are equally decadent.  Espresso, burnt caramel, and heavy, bittersweet dark chocolate engulf the tongue.  Theres a touch of umami in there that is hard to describe, maybe something along the lines of grilled dry figs, or perhaps even a touch of grilled, smoky portobello.  Finishes long and earthy, with hop resins really coming through on the back end.  The mouthfeel is thick and slightly cloying, and it could potentially benefit from some slight oxidation.  Carbonation is soft but persistent, and alcohol is fairly well hidden.  Overall, its a rich and complex brew unlike anything else.  Great stuff.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

502,"2007-11-09",4.7,"Long-awaited bottle from jake65 - big thanks, Jake!  Batch 67.  Sweet malty nose reminds of a hoppy barely wine, peaty Scotch, and a dark chocolate soufflé, with wooden rummy notes and lesser hints of smoke, plums, raisins and alcohol.  Pitch pour with a gorgeous, though extremely frisky light brown head - creamy and tiny-bubbled, rocks-out with some serious staying power.  Attention-grabbing, robust taste: sour and lightly bitter with distilled elegance and peaty smoke claws.  Complex malts push the citric hops to the background.  Cigar stench, plums, and a spritely herbal quality.  Some sweaty, tarry tobacco.  Sweet soy and a distant splash of mocha, but no brown sugar.  A little alcohol burn in the throat but more aptly ""warming.""  Body is rather full and a bit syrupy, but theres something satisfying there, too.  Strong!  Plums are a bit more pronounced on the tongue than in the nose.  Light roasted fruit, a little burnt peach and loaf-glaze flambé.  Sip the luxus, theres a ton going on here.  Quite a sturdy backbone; I had this alone, and it was potent; should stand up well next to even very hearty dishes.

A bittersweet dark ale that is is similar to a sweet stout or a barley wine.  This has a flavor of brown sugar and chocolate with alcohol warmth coming in and semi harsh hops in the finish.  It is a little like alcoholic Turkish coffee plus prunes.  It makes a big impact on the palate and clears out the sinuses.

The aroma is grainy chocolate, coffee, dark fruits and a little alcohol.

The flavor is sweet (sugary) and smoky chocolate, black licorice and vinous fruits with a tarry alcoholic bitter finish.  As it warms, the alcohol overpowers the sweetness.  The mouthfeel is medium to full and slightly watery with soft carbonation.

Overall, a very fine beer.  It tastes a little like a super-charged Hibernation, but with more burnt tar and anise (which come out more as it warms).  I liked it better colder.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"

The taste is very much heavy on chocolate, cocoa, and roasted malt, a nice coffee bitterness lingers on the finish.  This beer is really thick and the finish lasts forever, just a great beer all around.  Batch 63-Thanks OSLO! With this beer I didnt get any of the piney hops from the fresher bottle.  Instead, smells of chocolate, vinousness, and some red delicious apple skin compose the aroma.  A light smell of smoke is present too along with toasted walnut again.

502,"2007-09-15",5.0,"Once in a while a beer will come along that aims to knock your socks off, and succeeds.  Rarely is brewing perfection achieved from start to finish, but lets give the rundown on this one, for the amateurs who may be unawares:
Aroma - Just the first enticement at the beauty to come.  Just from the aroma you can tell this is going to be something special.  A smoky element intertwines with a chocolatey one.  And its all up-front, unmistakeable, undiluted, unapologetic.
Appearance - You fucking kidding me?  This pours pitch-dark with a head that just wont go away.  Just wont go down, dammit.  Great, just great.
Flavor - Delivers on just what the aroma promises.  Chocolatiness intermixed with dried smokiness and then the sweetness and then the fruity undertones and Porcupine Tree informs me in the background that one of the wonders of the world is going down.
Palate - Full-body, thick and chewy and full welcome after-linger.

The flavour doesnt leave a lot to be desired. Its packed with sweetness and flavours of dark ripe fruits, caramel, molasses which becomes a tobacco-esque/licorice bitterness in the end. Thick, sugary mouthfeel which stayes in the mouth and with the warmth of the alcohol going down, makes it very potent.

Just alot of complex flavors that are more smokey and bitter. It is almost winey in mouthfeel. There is a pronounced warming effect with this one too. Pleasant.

I let it sit for a few minutes to taste it closer to room temp. As it warmed the flavor became increasingly more sweet. The sweet caramel and chocolate flavor became noticable.

Adam pours the darkest of browns with only tiny hard to spot mahogany highlights when held direcly to the light. A big 2+ finger head of the utmost creaminess formed on the pour and just stayed put. Leaves moderate lacing after each sip. The creamiest head on a beer I can remember.

Lots of heavy, deep, dark aromas. First thing that hits the nose is a roasted malty goodness quickly followed by a solid campfire smokiness. When I smell deeper I pick up cream and some dark fruits including figs and raisins. Smells utterly unique and exceptional.

The flavor is so complex and dark that I cant even begin to describe the complexity. I will try and give a description in simplified form though. Roasted malts give a nice bitterness upfront followed by a shot of cream and a quick gulp of campfire smoke. Toward the finish theres a very welcomed berry sweetness including blackberries, some bing cherries, and (although not a berry) fig. Mild hop bitterness on the tongue that intensifies as the bottle disappears.

The mouthfeel of this beer is absolutely sublime. I cant pick out one thing even remotely wrong with this mouthfeel. Thick and lush describe it perfectly. Oh, and velvety, smooth and creamy. I guess there is no end to the positive adjectives that could be used to describe the body of this brew.

Everything about this beer is so big and enjoyable that it would be tough to drink more than a couple. Id hate to drink more than one, actually, for the simple fact I would feel like Im disrespecting such a fine brew.

This is a World class old ale from Hair of the Dog. Actually this is a world class ale of any sorts. If this was available in my area I would order it by the truckload. Anxious to try other batches.

502,"2007-08-08",3.9,"Pours a deep, dark black with a very thick, tan head consisting of lots of variously-sized bubbles (some tight, some big and sudsy) that lace the glass. The aroma is thick with alcohol, malts, and bitter, dried fruits (prunes, currants).  The flavor starts intensely bittersweet with some chocolate, some vinous dried fruit, some fruity, bitter hops, and crazy malts whose flavor covers the span from dark caramel to blackstrap molasses. The middle of the tongue detects the growing tide of malt - big, chewy, sweet malts - more caramel and molasses with hints of figs and prunes. The finish is huge with alcohol - warming and head-rushing. But it isnt unpleasant nor does it burn - but it is noticeable. Also noticeable in the finish are more fruit, some semblance of bitter hops that only barely manage to balance the tide of dark, syrupy, chocolatey, fruity malts. Much better than I was expecting. As the beer warms, aromas and flavors of smoke and raisins become apparent. The mouthfeel is thick, a bit over-carbonated,  and greatly lightened by the firm presence of alcohol. Despite the conspicuous presence of alcohol, the beer is smooth and drinkable. But it isnt deceptively smooth - you know youre drinking a 10% beer.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

It had some strong dark citrusy notes such as raisins or prunes. I cautiously tasted it and realized, ""this is DEFINITELY not infected!"" The alcohol is definitely not masked in this. Its quite intense. There are some strong smoked qualities as well as some subtle coffee and cocoa notes. The finish is lightly bitter.

Very (and I mean, very) full mouthfeel. Flavour is absolutely stunning! At the beginning, a slightly sour cherry note comes through.

502,"2007-06-30",4.2,"Aroma of a classic ale, fruity and a little musty.  Coffee-brown color.  This is a wonderfully intense ale, almost a hybrid of a good hearty dark ale and a porter or stout.  A base of coffee-tinged malt flavors has overtones of fruitiness, plus more complex things I cant identify -- maybe some roasty molasses.  It has a bittersweet finish, with a late dryness on the tongue.  The mouthfeel is smooth, almost milky.  Because its bottle-conditioned, there were particles visible even in the murk, and a noticeable residue on the bottom of the glass -- but thats not necessarily a bad thing.  Highly recommended.","Hartland, Wisconsin, USA","Flyer"

This was the ninth of 26 beers that I sampled and rated during the tasting. Poured from a giant bottle that I think dated to the late 1990s and that had been sitting on top of a beer fridge at Blue Max Liquors for years. Intriguing, yeasty, grappa-esque aroma. Italian spice and herb scents. Pours brown with no head. Very sweet taste. Dark chocolate chips, butterscotch, and vanilla flavors. The flavors are interesting, but its not so much my thing. Very thick and smooth in the palate. Hardly carbonated at all. I think the consensus was that the RBSG 07s giant bottle of Adam was past its prime, but it still wasnt bad.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Beautiful nose: cherries, candied fruits (plums and dates), a slight perfume-y, floral sweetness. Wet wood. Raisins and a slight hint of alcohol. Quite viscous on the palate with a near perfect amount of carbonation. Amazingly complex flavor profile.  Theres a hint of malted whisky complexity. Excellent balance between sweet (malt) and dry (hops & yeast). Its quite a fight... like two heavyweights duking it out in the final round, but it ends in a draw with neither dominating over the other. Almost perfectly balanced. The finish starts with a vinous amarone like sweetness and ends with a beautiful saison-esque spicy dryness. Wow. This beer gives you a workout but its worth it. 

 have sampled many, many vintages of this beer in the 3 years since I originally rated it and the beer just keeps getting better and better. Absolutely top-notch, world class beer.

Aroma is an interesting subtle mix of brown sugar-type sweetness, raisins, and a brisk funk smell.  My first impression is that this beer is robust, but not heavy.  The most noticable characteristic is the tart-funkiness in the finish.  Although my mind begins to compare it to JP, it is a bit different.  The funk character is dry, almost smoky and quite sweet.  An interesting beer.","Florida, USA","JMFG"

Redolent, full-bodied funk on the nose, but its not a *big* aroma, if that makes sense...its just really dimensional and well-developed. Cookie dough in there somewhere, too, very faintly. Sweet and sour, if you will. Big body but very clean--lots of presence but not not oily or sticky at all. Super aggressive attack: bitter hops and funk and deep grainy, husky malt hit you all at once. Tough to sort out (this is still a young beer. Im killing a baby here). Easily the most pleasant metallic note Ive found--its here on the finish. Clingy, lingering sourish/metallic finish. This was intensely bitter on the attack when I had to drink off some overflow, but that slurpy drink is the only one thats tasted so bitty, and Im not about to drink a whole beer that way...even though it was almost better than a regular sip. Theres some dark fruit and black licorice in the mid palate on this one, but primarily a big sharp roast. Ill be back again and again for this one.

502,"2007-03-24",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2009 Pours a deep purple-black with a huge tan head which seems to be two-tiered - a thick, dense layer on the bottom, and a foamy thin one on the top. Great lace. Dark malt sweetness & figs in the aroma - very engaging, but not overpowering. Incredible taste - malty & delicious with a generous smattering of hops. Nutty, roasted, slightly sweet at first but overpowered by excellent hopping. Bitter, peppery hops - not grassy citrus. Syrupy-thick body, perfect carbonation (despite some leakage during shipping). I am in love. Thanks to robinvboyer for the trade!

 Deep dark brown ale with a monstrous l brown bubbly head.

Sweet deeply malted taste, first noticed then a busrst of fruity goodness, followed  by strong liquorice notes and even notes of apricot.

You can also feel the slight alcohol burn as well.","Boise, Idaho, USA","pinkzambia"
502,"2007-03-14",4.9,"UPDATED: MAR 4, 2009 Batch 66. Pours a dark muddy brown with a large, thick tan head that leaves sticky lace.  Very unique aroma.  Malty, grassy, earthy, slight chocolate.  Flavor is intense chocolate and lots of malts, smooth but heavy.  Great balance and complexity.  I had high hopes for this and they were met and exceeded.  

Re-rate. Batch 67.  I had to re-visit this one because this bottle was totally different than my first one.  Lot more chocolate, stout-like qualities.  Smells like a Belgian Imperial Stout.  Taste is full-bodied, huge chocolate with an incredible richness.  One of the richest beers Ive ever tasted.  This is easily one of the best couple beers Ive ever had.

Batch 70. I keep re-rating this beer because each bottle is so different.  This beer reminds me a lot of Orval - not that they are anything like each other just that they vary so much bottle to bottle and are so unique.  The complexity is astounding. Pours cola brown with a huge foamy tan head. Crazy shapes and lacing are formed from this monster of a head. Aroma is beef jerky, smoke, peat, earthiness and just a hint of chocolate.    Taste is very smooth, chocolate, with a smoky finish.  Much more smooth than the 67.  Everytime I drink this Im reminded of a different style: Belgian strong ale, dopplebock, imperial stout, Scotch ale.  Different every time but blows me away the same.  Well see how this batch ages.  

Batch 1. What an opportunity to be able to try this.  Thanks to TheBeerSommelier for trading this to me.  Hugely anticipated beer, obviously, given my great fondness for Adam.  Brewed 14 and a half years ago, this is the oldest beer Ive had to date.  A small hiss when the cap is popped, a good sign.  Pours a little lighter than every other Adam Ive had, a bit more cherry color in there than normal.  Some bubbles form when I pour, slightly carbonated but then they pretty much disappear completely.  Aroma is all aged Barley Wine at first.  Classic dried","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Highly complex aroma: plums, cherries, raspberries, dark chocolate, anise/liquorice, light smoke, and a clovelike spiciness.  Tastes pretty much like the aroma, like some sort of spicy/dry dark chocolate and dried fruits, vanilla, nuts prunes.  THick and creamy, but not overly so, and nicely tingly carbonation.  Finishes woody, slightly burnt, and very dry.  Hops enhance the earthy qualities.  Pretty great beer any way I look at it.

Its one of the most unique beers out there.

[Previous Rating from 3/5/2007]  Not knowing what type of brew this was, I snagged a bottle at Higgins for dessert, and I couldnt of made a better choice. Poured a deep brown/black with a huge tan head.  Sweet cocoa-like, malty aroma... flavors of chocolate, figs, tarts, smoked meat or cheese, and maybe something like a coffee undertone.

Also dark fruit, coffee, molasses, and a touch of pine. Roasted malt flavor backed by most of the aroma esters. Big alcohol presence. Long-lasting smoky espresso and light hop aftertaste.

502,"2007-02-24",4.5,"Batch 65.  Pours a dark dark brown, like a light stout or dark porter with a generous light tan head.  The nose is rather heavy with alcohol, but in a very appealing way.  Theres so much go on,  I cant hope to describe it all.  Dark fruits, prune, roast, some robust herbal hops, and even a touch of mint.  Very very dry though.  Thick in the mouth, I was troubled to take a big enough sip of this at first to judge palate because this is such a special treat for me!  Really very viscous and nice, without being syrupy, but thats helped by the fact that this isnt a very sweet beer.  The flavor is incredibly complex.  The alcohol is noticeable, though not distracting.  Its part of the experience.  Dark roast, a subdued smoke, dark fruits, all very dry with the most mellow of malt sweetness.  Theres such balance here.  Something leathery and earth really draws this together nicely.  The finish is a little sweet, but again very subtle roast with some subtler smoke.  The aftertaste is where the smoke really comes out as well as a surprising herbal hop element.  I really really enjoyed this beer and I hope to hell I can find some more in my upcoming travels to Philly and DC!","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

Palate is smooth, not quite silky, maybe a touch chalky, feels pretty full. Lacing kind of sloppy. Flavor is fairly port-like along with the dark chocolate and raisins. There is a an odd note in there as well, guess Ill just call it earthy funk because doesnt quite match anything I can think of. Not much aftertaste. Aroma was a bit better than actual flavor.

Cloudy brown pour with a small fading tan head. Aroma is incredibly complex and features plums and other fruits, smoke, anise, alcohol in moderation, fruitcake, caramel and figs. Flavor is just as divine and of a similar nature. Smokey malts dance around dark dry fruits and sweet dark malts. Alcohol is very well masked, chocolate tarts are uncovered.

Smell is of coffee, chocolate, with a small wiff of vinegar and fresh daisies.

Batch 65...  Hair of the Dog Adam is a dark brown color and pretty opaque with a bit of sediment suspended in it.  The initial pour produced a MASSIVE dense, tan-colored head that collapsed VERY slowly.  I had half a glass of liquid and half a glass of head!  The aroma is mostly chocolate with some hidden fruit and a touch of alcohol.  The flavor is even better and more complex.  There are flavors of weak chocolate, caramel, aged fruit, molasses, a bit of liquorice, some wood, a touch of smoke, and some alcohol.  The malt profile is deep and complex and offers a balanced, moderate sweetness to the overall flavor profile.  On top of that, the finish is long and also pretty complex with more of the smoky chocolate and dark fruitiness coming though.  This beer is a little thicker than average, but not overly heavy.  Overall, the malt and flavor profiles with the touch of smoke remind me of a Scotch Ale in away.  This is a very good beer and lives up to its high ratings.  Im so glad that I had the privilege of trying this wonderful beer.  --

1994 Vintage (Batch Number 1)
April/May 2008:  Adambier is opaque and dark brown in color.  It has an amazing aromatic blend of sweet, deep malts, licorice, and dark fruits.  It smells a bit like port.  There is a lot of realy deep and rich caramel maltiness in the flavor as awell as some light tobacco.  It has a dry finish and the alcohol seems to come and go serving to enrich the overall experience.  This full-bodied beer is thick and smooth and coats the mouth well.  Overall Adambier is so complex and quite excellent.

Pours dark dark brown with amber edges and lasting tan head. The aroma is big earthiness followed by sweet cherry candy mixed with herbal notes. Behind that I get dark fruity esters coming from plums and dark grapes along with and sweet caramel candy. The taste is just like the aroma with loads of complexity starting with full on earthiness mixed with sweet dark fruitiness followed by herbal notes, sweet caramel candy and rich tasty chocolate malts. The herbal notes grow into the finish. YUM.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
502,"2006-12-01",3.4,"12oz bottle.  This is a very well thought of beer but, unfortunately, it doesnt do much for me.  Pours very dark with a nice thick beige head.  Flavor is carmel and  chocolate especially.  Very smokey and hoppy as well.","Delaware, USA","LennyH"
502,"2006-11-29",4.4,"A big thankyou to Kook for lobbing this one back from the U.S. This was the last beer for the night and easily one of the best.   Warm by the time we got stuck into it. It literally exploded from the bottle and poured a hazy, deep, tawny chestnut in the light. Like engine oil away from it. Head was just a messy tan web of froth that drabbed the glass well. Doughy, peaty and thickly malty nose that offers some savoury fruit, marzipan and cocoa powder, crushed herbs and a little tickle of alcohol. Warming, liqueur-like presence in the mouth, very smooth and very rich. Complex malt and yeast flavours abound, this starts off well and just gets better. Finest Belgian chocolate mixed with milk-duds, Raisins and prunes, some fortified wine, dusty cocoa, leather and wood. Big spicy back-drop, some cinnamon in back, all finishing of velvety and smooth, and oh-so-long. Nice warmth in back, the alcohol is present, but controlled and it becomes quite woody, almost peaty in the aftertaste. Been wanting to taste this one for years so I couldnt pass up trying it before going home to bed. Cheers again to Kook!!! (33cL)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"
502,"2006-11-24",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 27, 2007 Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a black color with a large tan head. The aroma was port wine, molasses and a hint of fruity hops.

Marvelous.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
502,"2006-11-17",4.5,"This is one great beer. WOW. An intensity that is rarely matched here. A thick, viscuous liquid that is black in color with deep purple highlights. The mouthfeel on this is coating, very thick almost like its a beer reduction somehow. The taste is figs, dark brown sugar, all spice, and still has another level of smokiness that is just perfect. The alcohol is very well hidden. I will be looking for this again, and again.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

Its rather velvetty smooth on the tongue with just the right amount of carbonation.  Complex flavors chocolate, dark fruits, raisins, prunes, nuttiness, and a little smoke around the edges.

502,"2006-11-01",4.1,"Bottle.  Stout-like appearance-- muddy dark brown with a creamy lasting light brown head.  Rich and complex chocolate and coffee roasted malt and nutty aromas--Bosco, Nutella, egg cream, espresso.  Sweet, spicy and earthy mocha flavors- dark bittersweet chocolate, dark roast coffee with some nuttiness and dark fruit notes.  The spicy character up front morphs into a mild and pleasant bitterness on the finish, with just a faint bit of alcohol smokiness and warmth detectable after swallowing.  Otherwise, alcohol well hidden. Medium to full palate with some fine carbonation.

502,"2006-10-28",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2012 Bottle from Kramer17801, thanks buddy!  Pours quite dark, opaque mahogany, though it looks black in the middle. The head is very nice and well-defined. It starts at a good two inch depth and remains as a small layer throughout the entire duration of drinking. The aroma is sweet of honey buns, licorice, peat, pipe smoke, woody notes. Nice bittersweet body of licorice and leather, a lot of savor notes which remind me of tokin a cigar. The finish brings out a bit more sweetness, though its very subtle and is conveyed in a doughy fashion, maybe a hint of cream cheese. This is damn good stuff.

Bottle batch 67  I really, really enjoyed this brew last time and it warranted a revisit. The pour is black with a tall, tall tan head. The nose has very light hops which add spruce to the thick malty aromas akin to cigar, leather, peat, molasses, chocolate. Mouth is dense and sticky. Ah, this gets better as it warms. More smoke, meat, smoked meat, peat, cigar, earth. The finish lingers, clinging to my palate with a wonderful smoky-sweet flavor. I really enjoy dark, malty, big beers. This delivers density, maltiness, and complexity in a way that an imperial stout would, but with a discernably different flavor profile. I love this beer, it is the epitome of a well crafted, sophisticated ale.

[March 22, 2010]

Bottle of batch 76 from Kahns. Ive always really enjoyed this beer. It is roasty, hearty and rich without being an imperial stout or barleywine. A wonderful departure from the norm. Very heavy leather flavors are present along with meat, smoke, figs and chocolate. This is very rich, balanced and complex. Just crazy good.

Reminds me of some Imp. stouts.  The taste is more of the same, smoke, wood, black licorice, some fruit, tabacco.

502,"2006-10-10",0.9,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2008 Deep garnet colour, generous tan head. Sweet aroma of burnt cane sugar was not a great start, flavour is probably what a cane field tastes like right after harvest. Ash and sugar. Im not going with the crowd on this one, I think its over the top in the burnt flavours department and its sickly sweet too. Tasted like ass. not that I would know.
I am from this sentence forward changing my rating a little. from a .5 to .9 mainly because I was new then and couldn’t understand what I got my self into. That being said, these very strong beers are not my thing and for my own reference that rating will stay low.

Aroma is tobacco up front, then some smoke, raisins, light soy sauce, ETOH and roasty malts.  Never have I had such a tobacco aroma in a beer.   Smoke, tobacco, and alcohol arfe the strongest up front in taste, some acidity and soy back again giving way for a roasty coffee finish.  There is also a nondescript fruitiness.  It does have a vinous quality to it, reminiscent of a good port wine.  Full bodied, smooth moderate carbonation.  I am sad that I drank my only beer of this.

To me, it was like a mix of an Imperial IPA and a stout, since both the strong hoppy bitterness was there as well as a nice malt backbone. Great, because it wasnt sweet, rather it had a huge, long dry finish. It poured a deep copper with a long lasting head and a superb aroma. In the mouth was a whole medley of different flavors, with a long, somewhat hot finish. It is a serious beer, a contemplative beer that you really need to drink slowly.

It starts with what you expect from the aroma--chocolate malt, and a nice smoky flavor. At the end, however, you get hit with a very strong sense of earthy bitterness. This flavor lingers in the aftertaste--and it just doesnt match the rest of the beer in my opinion. 4.5
Batch 58 re-rate
Lots of peat flavor in this batch, with a definite sour flavor mixed in.  Not as much chocolate.  Very tangy, and not nearly enjoyable as the newer vintages Ive had. 3.5 Score changed to reflect both ratings.","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"

Aroma was comprised mostly of roasted malt, with a little bit of fruity sweetness.  The flavor was also very much about the roastedness.

Flavor definately expands from what the aroma would lead you to believe. A huge maltiness combined with a seductive roastiness and gentle sweetness from some crystal malts.  There is definately some smoked malt being used.  The smoke flavor is not too much to dominate or detract from the other flavors but still strong enough to lend complexity and uniqueness.  A full bodied beer but not overly so that it becomes sticky or syrupy.  Definately in a class of its own.","san diego, California, USA","winegarner"

502,"2006-05-15",4.4,"Reading the label, I did not expect the contents of this bottle to pour as they did. Poured a very dark color ... deep brown I would say (the label calls it garnet which I think of as more red). My initial inspection of the beer delighted my nose with a deep, smokey smell and a hint of chocolate malts. I thought for sure this was a porter or stout from the pour/smell. I feel  this is could be called a very strong porter - with some fruit added in for sweetness. The fruit flavors are subtle, but stronger than the alcohol presence. A full malt profile with the light fruit notes makes this an excellent beer. I enjoyed this one slightly colder than I serve most beers, which may have helped with the alcohol profile..
If only I had read the reviews first I could have saved this for dessert, but its equally excellent any time and shouldnt be missed.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Caliber"

2006-05-XX Huge gushing creamy billowy tan head that lasts forever on top of a ruby tinged dark brown body. Sweet woody fruity aroma with hints of cherries and muted plums. Depth of head makes it hard to actually get to the flavour right away. Rich fruity malt, raisins and dark fruit with a light touch of acidic bitterness that leaves a tangy buzz in the mouth. Light alcohol presence and very light chocolate notes. Medium palate feels more full bodied than it actually is because of the creamy carbonation.

Has a hoppy aroma and taste of dark fruit, like grapes, plums & figs. Spicy with a hint of the alcohol to come. As it warms up around mid-bottle, aroma and taste switch more to chocolate with a hint of malt. Alcohol becoming much more evident, but in the after taste and warming sensation, not the mouthfeel. At the end of the bottle, it begins to resemble a barley wine in taste, texture and alcohol. I think Hair of the Dog covered about all beer styles with this one.

Mild aroma of roasted malt, dark fruit, spices, yeast, sour wine and some metal or ""bottle"" aroma which led us to open a 2nd bottle to make sure the bottle wasnt off -- turns out it wasnt off, it just has something odd in the smell -- Its not unpleasant, just different I guess. Because we had two bottles going we were able to have one at room temperature and one cold and even though the cold one went down easier the one at room temperature had much more flavour and complexity, it was quite something actually. Dry flavour starts with fruit, caramel malt and some chocolate followed by a mild sourness, smoke and spices and a mild finish of alcohol and hops -- so much going on there and its hard to pin down.

502,"2006-02-21",4.5,"Batch 60.  And a beer this good is worth a little anecdote:  This was something I wasnt expecting.  Sure, it was on my list of beers that I requested my in-laws to bring down from Pennsylvania.  My wife and I were opening our home to them so that they could travel to and fro Daytona Beach for some race up there.  To show their appreciation when they come to visit, they usually bring down a couple of cases of fine brews not yet available in Florida, mostly regional stuff, but sometimes I ask for a little something else.  This was something else.  And even though it was number two on my list, I really wasnt expecting it.  Even after it was here, I was still not expecting it, especially since it cost $60 for the case (but I guess our rate is still cheaper than a comparable hotel).  My mother-in-law quipped that we should savor every sip.  She also mused about how the beer guy was impressed by this list (my list!) that her daughter sent her.  Anyway, on to the beer:  This is a dark beer, impenetrable red (so red, its brown), with a luscious, creamy head, like marshmallows melting in hot cocoa.  I get green apples and red wine (maybe something mulled), charred wood and dark fruits.  The sweetness is neither intimidating nor cloying, even if the beer is not yet up to temperature.  Not overly malty with a good sense of hop bitterness.  As for the alcohol content: no worries; Ive sampled 7% ABVs that tasted stronger.  Or perhaps, that is something about which to worry.

This one is heavier on the malt.  Very solid beer.  I tend to favor the heavier hops.  Maybe the higher malt content is why this is considered a tradional ale versus a barley wine.

502,"2006-01-28",5.0,"Hair of the Dog Adam is loosely based on a strong, top fermented, old German beer style called Adambier, that originated in Dortmund, Germany. It is a style that had long been forgotten, until the Hair of the Dog Brewing Company decided to revive the style with their version. A very memorable vintage I sampled was a 1.5 liter bottle, brewed in 1999, that I picked up on a beer trip to Portland, back in 1999. Adam is a high gravity brew, weighing in at a mighty 10% avb, with 50 IBU, (hop bitterness levels) and actually improves with age from bottle conditioning. HOTD Adam has yeast added to the bottle for a secondary fermentation in the bottle. 

HOTD Adam pours to a beautiful deep/dark garnet color with a thick and creamy tan head, and a very soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is extremely complex and aromatic. Deep malty aromas of sweet and dark chocolate malt, marry with peppery waves of alcohol strength, and hints of vanilla. The palate is extremely rich and complex with layers of flavors. Sweet malt, caramel, dark chocolate, raisin, roasted pepper, pipe tobacco, and wisps of peat smoke coat the tongue. The body is hefty and lush on this beer, slick and full, as you take each sip. This beer finishes with more deep and complex malty flavors up front, then ends with a long, slightly hop bitter, very soothing, and very warming alcohol burn. 

Words can not do justice to how deep and complex the malt character of this beer is. I am amazed at how impressed I am with this beer each and every time it is my pleasure to drink it. This is an amazingly complex and delicious beer, and I would not dare to match it with anything. Chocolate truffles or a Cuban cigar might be the only things worthy. Enjoy this beer young, and cellar bottles to enjoy with some age on them. Without a doubt one of my all time favorite beers.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
502,"2006-01-26",4.0,"(01.22.06) 12 oz brown bottle received as a gift from Scott L. 10% ABV. Batch 55.  Hazy brown ale with a tan shaving cream head on top. Soft carbonation.  Nice smoky chocolate aroma. Full-bodied with light malt sweetness.  Complex flavors of caramel, smoke, chocolate, and roasted malt flavors.  Finishes with a pleasant light smoke flavor. Very smooth and flavorful.  Definite alcoholic warmth. According to the Hair of the Dog website description, Batch 55 means that this particular bottle is a vintage beer - brewed on 6/12/02 and bottled on 8/14/02.

502,"2005-10-23",4.2,"12oz bottle. Batch 60, which makes it between 1 1/2-2 years old. Pours dark brown/black with a light red tint and a huge 3 finger, mocha colored head. The beer was served at 57° in my duvel tulip. The aroma is very burgandy-like, earty and winey, with a flanders red sourness and hints of overripe, dark fruit. Smells wonderful! The initial taste is ""flanders-red"" like sourness, cocoa, oak?, overripe red grapes, and some dark roasted malt. The finish is taken over by the rush of warming alcohol, fruit, and a slight, hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is substantial at first but the finish is drying and astringent, making it easy to drink. Not sure if the sourness is supposed to be there, but if it is an accident, it is a tasty one.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

502,"2005-10-10",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 9, 2007 Bottle (with aged Gorgonzola drenched in organic maple syrup).Very dark, almost black with huge, tan, rocky head, that lasts forever. Aroma is surprisingly acidic, tastes like home brew gone bad. Still some notes of dark fruit, alcohol and oak was underneath the sour aroma. The flavor is simpler, but cleaner, with dark bitter chocolate surrounding a core of burned raisins leading to a not entirely pleasant acidic finish (like biting in rotten fruit). As it warms some slight brettanomyces is revealed, which suits this beer very well together with the oak notes. Mouth feel is totally overpowered by too much carbonation, making it hard to pour and enjoy. This beer was probably infected, but I was still able to finish it, and enjoy it, which is a testament to its underlying greatness. I wish I could try it fresher.

There are many things about this beer that are very high quality.

Its all there in an undeniably rich and delicious beer.  A thick, almost oily body, but the hopping prevents the finish from being syrupy (which is what I was aniticipating, as in some Imperial Stouts), oh, and the taste of a fine cigar seems to linger on the palate once the glass is empty.

Rich caramel, coffee, madagascar chocolate cut with condensed milk, dark homemade bread, pork roast.  BUttery, creamy, bursting with round flavors.

502,"2005-08-31",4.0,"Bottle courtesy of Suttree: Very interesting color that is difficult to describe - light brown, but totally opaque.  Its a brown with low saturation levels and just a hint of amber & purple.  Sitting atop this body is a small, thin beige head that quickly diminishes to a tiny ring around the glass.  The aroma is every bit as unique as the appearance, and is also complex.  Scents of sweet grape juice & honey-covered granola hit first, then dried fruit, molasses, tobacco, smoky charred wood (there has to be some rauchmalt in here), light sulphur, yet theres also an unmistakable odor of apples.  The taste is rich and complex all the way through.  Initially dark molasses and coffee flavors dominate - but theyre never roasty and syrupy, rather theyre subtle and reserved.  Next a quick bite of apple surfaces, followed by nutmeg, dirt covered ginger root, candied fruit, tobacco, smoky dark chocolate, a strange fleeting taste of almost intolerable sweet peppermint, toffee, and an almost salty stale yeast flavor that reminds me of old English ales.  Medium-full bodied, mild carbonation, does feel a bit heavy/syrupy at times in the mouth.  This is a real treat.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

I wrote in Aug 05 ""Pours strikingly dark with a rich mocha head. Complex aroma of molassas, dried fruit, a soft hint of humus, mango, and a whisper of grapefruit rind. The flavor is rich and intense and chewy; molassas and dark-roasted coffee and tobacco and dates followed by a relatively subdued hint of the 10% alcohol and then an orchestra of flavors changing across a strikingly long malted finish. The mouthfeel is superb, rich, ideally carbonated, complex. As the beer warms, the alcohol becomes more prominant, as does the smokiness. 8/4/8/5/17=4.2 

December 2007: Another fresh bottle, this one served at celler temperature. Appearance is described above, with a vast meringue head that sticks to the side of the glass in thick globs. Tons going on in the aroma. Leather and peat, smoke and cork, chocolate and molasses, raisin and dried apple, candied grapefruit. Smoky peat and especially chocolate dominate the flavor, which is sweet and extremely intense - this one has one of the strongest flavors, almost like a syrup extract, of any beer Ive tasted. A bit of a citric snap in the finish; Id love to see this rounded out with some age, just as Id love to see those intense flavors mellow. I need to lay a few bottles of this stuff down right away.

The suggested pairing with chocolate (Green and Black 70%) is a disappointment in that even this chocolate cannot hold its own against the beer and is basically lost against its residual flavors and immediately swamped in the next sip.

2007 bottle May 08. As above. This was so damn good it makes me wonder why I screw around with trying 30 new beers a month when I could drink this every night for way cheaper. Nice to see it rocking a 4.13 on the site.

Aroma is of intense molasses, cigars, and wood.  Rich and silky on the mouth with a bit of bite from the carbonation.  Quite full bodied and syrupy sweet.  Same molasses and smoke flavors with a touch of alcohol.  Great character and depth, the kind of beer made for introspection.  A stunning beer.","Laguna Niguel, California, USA","chilehead"

Taste was excellent, not too much alchohol even though its 10%.  Lots of roasted malts, dried dates and other dense fruit flavors, mocha.  Mouthfeel was nice and smooth.

502,"2005-08-04",3.7,"12 oz bottle:  Thank you RB Secret Santa!  Deep brown w/ some mohogany highlights and a lasting thick light beige head.  Lots of chocolate. caramel, and toasted almonds.  Light hints of vanilla and alcohol as well as sherry & dried cherries.  Alcohol aroma becomes a little stronger as it warms.  Toasty malt also comes through as it warms.  Flavor is well balanced with sherry, toasty malt, and a bit yeasty.  Some caramel, definitely some alcohol, and hints of raisins in the flavor.  Finish is a bit on the sweet side, at least it would be if it werent for the alcohol which is apparent from start to finish.  The aftertaste is some herbal hop and toasted malt with hints of roastiness & chocolate.  Mouthfeel is HOT, HOT, HOT!!!!  Lots of burning alcohol in this one which takes away from a really fantastic beer!  Alcholic astringency, fuller medium body with a fair amount of carbonation which probably adds to the lighter mouthfeel.  If the alcohol were a little more well hidden, this would be and absolutely fantastic beer.  As it is, its a little below that due to the alcohol presence IMHO.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

Intense, rich, and complex nose of smoked rum raisins, molasses, moist cavendish tobacco, caramel, leather, and black cherry.  Flavor turned out to be quite similar with additional brash tones of rich candied dark fruit, and lightly smoked chocolate, with a near perfect balance of bitter citrusy hops rounding this out.  Balance was excellent to say the least.  Full bodied, moderate carbonation, bittersweet finish.  Not for everyone Im sure, but this beer was just amazing in my book.

502,"2005-07-18",4.3,"12 oz. bottle into tulip glass.  Sampled at the Brickskeller, Washington DC.  Batch 54.  Dope.  HUGE rocky foam head was like a demonstration of a supersaturated substance in chemistry class: it just kept on coming, and seemed to multiply in the glass.  The first glass poured was almost all foam, and the bartender got me a second glass so that it could sit for a while.  I saw him take it from the cooler, and he didnt shake it up, so Im guessing its just a characteristic of the beer.  On top of the that, the muther didnt dissipate, it just stayed there in its creamy contiguous glory like an insolent kid.  Head was tan-beige in color, fluffy but firm like extra thick root beer float foam; leaves lacing in bands that alternate with bands containing regular gaps.  Astringent bitter smell like funky orange peel or resiny weeds in a fallow field.  Quad-like malt bread with spices in a full creamy mouth.  Mild chocolate milk flavor with malted milk and a dry smooth hop finish.  Lightly creamy sweet up front.  Overall impression is that its like a cross between a hoppy barley wine and a quad, which is unique and awesome.  Murky amber orange brown in the glass.  Great smooth balance, goes down easy but makes you want to keep it in your mouth with all the great complexity, which includes golden raisin late in a long finish.  To reiterate: dope.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

A really good looking beer. Smells of sweet malts with a fair amount of floral hops detected and spice is also big. Some subtle tones of coccoa and plum are in the nose as well. Medium high bodied, nice and chewy thick. Tastes of sweet malt and molasses and spice, then the hops hit you to make things interesting. There also seems to be a licorice tinge and I think I may have sensed some fruits (apple, raisins, pear) as well. Finishes with a kind of sweetness that is hard to describe. Great mouthfeel. The alcohol is definitely there, but by no means is it ever overbearing. Really grew on me the more I drank and was able to sense its complexities.

502,"2005-06-01",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2007 Bottle courtesy of Wohlfs. Re-rate is from batch 64, scored a 4.2 on original, but no idea on batch number. Pours dark mahogany/brown, huge beige head, ressurected with evry swirl, highly barbonated. Aroma is very sweet chocolate, honey, fresh baked pumpkin and banana bread?, juicy dark fruit (hard to pickup through the chocolate), and faint alcohol. Initial flavor has lots of chocolate and caramel, licorice and spiciness (maybe rye?) through the middle. Finishes with dark fruit (plum/raisin) and roasted grain. Full bodied, carbonation tries to clean palate but, residuel chocolate and fruit aftertaste leaves you begging for more. Original rating I noted too much alcohol, this bottle its almost undectable. Very complex. Perfect dessert beer. Go as far to say, even at a 4.1 average, still underrated.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"

Pours a deep reddish brown, fairly opaque, light tan head that left such immaculate lacing that I could count the bubbles on the side of my glass (if that doesnt qualify for an appearance score of 5, I dont know what does). Aroma is rich and malty, a lot of chocolate, raisins, figs, and ethanol, wonderfully blended. Nice malty flavor, earthy, kind of fruity with some cherry notes, sweet but not overly so, bitter towards the finish and you can definitely taste the alcohol in the finish too. A hint of yeast from bottle conditioning, but the other flavors arent really affected by it. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, body is on the heavy side of medium, light carbonation seems about right.

This aroma, when not picked apart like I did, smells wonderful.  The flavor is weird.  Its like smoked meat and coffee grounds all in one.  Theres a peatiness like a single malted scotch may have.  Theres a lot of spices as well.  Like allspice or cinnamon and black pepper.  Theres some grass or grapefruit hops hiding under the big maltiness.

Aroma wasnt bad, with some roasted barley, heady prunes and an overall mustiness. Flavor started moderately sweet, moving again to prunes and some smokiness... with a dirty, bitter end. Thin on the palate. Sour/dry aftertaste of grape skins.

Chewy mouthfeel, tastes of leather and toasted malt. Some dark fruit, perhaps grape. Smoky, maybe even a little woodsy. Chocolate and tobacco in the sweetness. Little bit of a bitter, coffee finish. Id love to age some of this stuff.","West Hollywood, California, USA","johnyvt"

Finishes with firm chocolate, graham cracker, coffee like astringency, alcohol dryness.  This is complex and quite delicious.  A must try, and try again, and again, and put some in your cellar.

502,"2005-03-30",4.2,"A very interesting Beer.  Thanks for sharing, Doppelganger!  I thought the huge head was due to the bottlie tipping over in the car on the way to my house, but apparently everyone experiences it.  Dark reddish brown appearance with a light brown head.  Intriguing aroma of chocolate, caramel, toffee, alcohol, figs, sour milk.  Smoky, beef-jerky flavor, some sourness with lingering roasty dry finish.  Excellent.","Arkansas, USA","SunSkates"
502,"2005-03-26",4.1,"Redeem thyself O brewer of past disgust.  I had previously rated ""Fred"" pretty low because, quite frankly, its sick.  This was a nice ale with an exceptional roasty quality and a true uniqueness.  Roast caramel at the nose and some of the same in the taste but enough hops to make sure that it is not extremely sweet or roasty.  Overly full bodied and you need to pour it gently to try and diminish the huge head that this beer automatically generates.  I still had to scoop out a little of the foam with a spoon because I got tired of waiting for the head to die down.  They say it has a ""garnet"" color, OK, but I call it just plain brown. Nice alcohol warming.  By all accounts this sits atop the ratings in its respective style and I see why.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","entertheiceman"
502,"2005-03-22",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2005 Carmel melts into hops and keeps going into a mélange of vanilla, anise, cocoa, but it doesnt stop there, at that point the alcohol taste kicks-in, and then you get that plus effect; cocoa again, and a molasses-like syrup that ends in a brown sugar feeling that warms your heart and then breaks it when you take your last sip.","The Big Apple, USA","carlitos99"

502,"2005-03-09",4.5,"(12 oz bottle: $3.29 at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA) Wow, this is some kind of beer!  Its like a dark roasted barleywine.  The malt flavor is very sweet and very roasty, and there is plenty of fairly bitter hops to provide excellent balance.  Along with the sweet, roasty maltiness, a mild smokiness emerges in the finish.  10% alcohol is clearly evident, but enjoyable.  Big, full, rich, sticky, long-lasting mouthfeel is outstanding.  The nose is sweet, roasty and hoppy, with a fair amount of alcohol coming through.  Very dark brown in color and nearly opaque, with a general ruddy hue when held to light.  Lots of large, chunky, tan particles remain suspended in the beer in spite of their size.  Tan head pours to over an inch in height, and though the lower layer of the head is mostly large bubbles, retention is still excellent.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
502,"2005-03-04",4.0,"Pours almost opaque with an amber-orange sheen. Insane amount of dirty light tan head that settles in lumpy mounds, leaving glorious lacing. Aromas of cinnamon, smoke, and somthing funky and intrieging...a bit like blue cheese. Flavor is sweet up front, but before the sweet has had a chance to fade in a dignafied way, smoke, atringent roast and sourness crowd in, with some warming alcohol. Like taking a sip of stout, a bite of smoked pork roast marinated in teriyaki, and washing it down with a swallow of scotch. Restless and lively on the palate, but still manages to be quite smooth.  This is strange, strange stuff, unlike any beer Ive tasted. Im impressed! But I also dont think I want another one for a good long time.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"

Good fruity and malt taste.  There is also some black pepper, cinnamon and spices to go with a woody and warming alcohol burn.  Lacing is wonderful, mouth feel is full but smooth and creamy as well.

Hints of fall leaves, and some old coffee. The taste is a subtle mixture of vanilla, coffee and some dark chocolate. The taste smooths out with a creamy mouthfeel and some nicely balanced hopping.

There is a definate alcohol burn, however, I am not sure how much alcohol is in this bottle.  It is from a realtively old batch, and it is bottle conditioned.

Slightly tart on the beginning and end, with strong roasted malt flavors and chocolate in between.  Considering the complexity of the flavor, the body is in the middle of the road, and the aftertaste is very strong in the roasted malt department.

Aroma is very sweet; heavy, dark fruits; some alcohol. Super-rich flavor: Simply tons of malts; dark fruit; heavy-hitting, long-lasting hop finish; notes of alcohol and warmth in the stomach and exhale, but for 10% alcohol its well done.  Great staying power on the palate; both malt and hops linger for a long time; thick and frothy, and its great that its so sweet without being uncomfortably sticky.

My nose was interested but my eyes werent.  Not sure if it was my ""trois pistoles"" glass (had to buy one since Im in a hotel) or what, but I got no head at all.  Looks like a glass of grape juice.  Tastes of chocolate, red grapes, alcohol, prunes, cherry, hops, and alcohol.  Very strong and the taste lingers in my mouth for a really long time.

502,"2004-12-04",3.4,"UPDATED: MAR 30, 2005 Damn.  This is a strong mofoin beer. Batch 59 bottle drunk 12/04.  Crazy this is so much spice and dark dark schwarzbier like malting/flavoring.  It must be the predecessor to todays schwarzbier.  Very good amount of body, spicy herbalness with hops.  Very deep sprucey and licorice type of flavor.  Would drink again, but I think it needs more sugar.  Beer gets too dry and astringent without the necessary strong,  chewy malty body.  Had similar experiences with the 2002 doggie claws.  Chocolate and spice on the very end, with some roast and a very ash-like tobacco flavor.  Rich to say the least, but the body seems slightly loose after it sits out and warms fully.  Very dark dirt black/brown with light orange tinges.  Smattering of bubbles line the edge of the glass.  Very viscous.  Smells of spruce, chocolate and tons of alcohol.  Ack, I want to like this more, but its just too much alcohol, combined with spice.  Needs more balance.  Draught @ Redbones, 12/04.  Much what I remembered, and that is disappointing, because I really wanted to like this beer.  Too much on the hops, alcohol and astringency.  Its got a good roast flavor, good chocolate and yeast notes, but its not well-homogenized, has traces of wateriness throughout and the alcohol badly assaults the palate.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Hugely malty, dried-fruity, not too sweet aroma with some roastiness. Extremely malty, dried-dark-fruity, roasty, even slightly burned flavor with black coffee and slightly salty smoke. Full-bodied and intense, nicely warming palate with lowish carbonation. Truly an outstanding ""Dark Horizon lite"", with even a great drinkability, considering the ABV and full body. And yes, it’s not too sweet, either. Certainly among the Top 5 US beers I’ve had so far.
(Bottled@Oliver Twist, Stockholm, was 8-4-9-5-18=4.4) Dark brown, nearly opaque color with a small, tight and beige head. Very malty, hoppy, slightly sweetish, port-wineous imperial stout aroma.

Its was a rocky frothy head that was light tan in color and had at least a finger in height worth of head the entire session also leaving nice lacing as it was consumed. The aroma is extremely fruity with the smell of smoke and alcohol lingering about as well. Very interesting smell with some hints of medicine as well which actually blends into the smell quite nicely. The taste is big on roasted malts with notes of smokiness and dark fruits as well. This beer seems to be a style all its own with properties from a variety of standard styles incorporated. There is a slight hop and bitter finish to this one. The body on this is medium to full and it has good carbonation. I found this to be highly drinkable with not much of the 10% in sight.

I dont have any idea why I did not like this the first time around.  perhaps I rated this when I was not worthy.  Here is my new review and updated score:
Shared with Mr. Facto, CaptainCougar, & 1FastSTi.  12oz bottle, batch 47 (2000?).  Pours dark chestnut with a wispy head.  You can smell this one from across the room and it begs to be tasted.  Lush fruit (cherry and date) with deep malty sweetness, caramel candy and cigar notes.  Only a hint of cardboard buried under all that goodness.  The flavor has dark fruit (dates and other such) with light tobacco, coco, sweet complex malt.  Just outstanding, complex and an overall great experience.

It tickles with carbonation and alcohol. You can eat this in wedges. Treacle. Italian plum tart with whole wheat pastry and farm fresh butter. A little bubble gum. A touch antiseptic.

Banana, clove, coridander, figs, raisins, dark bittersweet chocolate, roasted nuts, tobacco, fruity, sour.  Medium to full body, starts out very carbonated and mellows out a bit.

Strong hop aroma with malt, chocolate, caramel dark fruits and Irish whiskey.  Flavor is quite intense; malty sweetness, fruits, raisins and a sharp hop finish.  Puts a burn in the gullet. Palate is complex and stimulating with an aggressive fizz, a hoppy biting middle and a dry metallic finish.  A well-done conglomeration of intense qualities with a good balance.

502,"2004-10-03",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2005 This certainly looks quite delightful. The color is a deep muddy purpleish mahogany. The head is well developed and frothy with the color of the head being very unique displaying its lightest tan hues. The frothy head morphs into a beautiful horseshoe sitting on top of the liquid. The lace is thick and dominant and hangs on easily saying stuff like "" wow, I wish this was more of a challenge."" Quite delightful indeed. 

Smells quite fruity with raisins and plums. Subtle smokiness in the aroma as well with honey and wood aged whiskey. 

At last.

Outstanding. The flavor just consumes my entire mouth. This is a beer, a very big beer. Lots of chocolate up front. The mid-palate is full of fruit with watermelon, cantaloupe, raisins, red grapes, banana and raspberries. Moderately acidic in the finish. Deliciously hoppy. Loads of tobacco and fruit juices on the finish.

Earthy, tobacco notes as well. Slight smoke too. Color is a muddy brown, light carbonation, but a decent head forms with tight, tight bubbles, almost as if it was pushed with nitrogen. Taste is at first fruity and tart, like not quite ripe plums, but then malt takes over. Quite a big bodied beer. Notes of wood. This has a complex taste that is quite enjoyable. Today is a cold, windy, rainy day here in Minnesota and this beer fits the weather perfectly. A nice, but not overpowering alcohol warming effect too. Great beer.

 crystalline lacing, which is all displayed above an opaque dark brown body. flavors are sugary and sweet; cherry, gooey pie crust, then it is a bit saltier as it warms. and as it warms, the lacing wets itself and says goodbye. its salty like an olive, but its not powerful. being a bit of a hophead, im looking for some outstanding bittering, but i dont think it belongs here  anyway. the mouthfeel is full and nothing more. this beer is

Color is a very dark brown with a very slight bit of rust.  Nice creamy white head on top that stays for the long haul.  Aroma is a lot of raisins, a lot of caramel, and a little bit of chocolate.  Palate wraps around the tongue and the roof of my mouth and settles towards the back of the tongue with a nice cocoa feel.  Mostly creamy feel with a slight bit of fizziness and chalkiness on the back of the tongue.  Taste is caramel, date, raisin, chocolate, some smokey wood, and a little bit of orange and cherry.

502,"2004-09-07",4.0,"Traditional ale? This looks and tastes pretty much like an imperial stout to me. Pours that almost black brown that imperial stouts are with a big creamy off-white head that leaves some nice sheets of lace behind. Nose is aggressively roasty. Body is thick and rich though maybe a hair of the dog low on carbonation. Theres quite a bit of interplay between dark malty and roasty flavors with notes of raisin, molasses, cask wood, charcoal, citrus, pine and just about everyother beer flavor I've ever tasted but its all topped off by a slight medicinal bitterness thats augmented by some fiery alcohol in the finish. I can dig it now but this would be top notch if some of the problems in the finish were ironed out. Some aging might help but Im not in the position to do that at the moment. Either way, this is an extremely and almost excessively complex imperial-stout-like beer so high marks for that.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Where, oh, where to start, where, oh, where to stop? A toffeeish flavor comes through on the palate, but before long everything is overtaken by smoke!

Pours a dark amber, almost approaching black color.  The beer is highly carbonated and is topped by a rocky brown head.  A rich aroma of rum, raisins, and smoke is found in the nose.  The smoke aroma comes to dominate the nose after a couple of sniffs.  The taste is sweet and thick, this is a very rich beer.  I get flavor notes of fig, raisins, rum, vanilla, aged wood, peat, and scotch..  This is pretty good stuff.  I really like the subtly smokiness, it adds another dimension and does not over-power any of the other components.  There are some spicy hop notes and a fruitiness that if not hop derived is certainly accentuated by them.  The finish is warming from the alcohol, but only in a smooth good way.  Overall this is quite the malty brew, it does have a bit of balancing bitterness in the finish, but only just enough.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

or, NOT the best way to open a bottle:
place in fridge and wait months to share with friend, then come home and knock off top shelf so as to watch it do aback flip to bottom shelf, hitting on cap and thereby spraying everything while staring in amazement and inaction until its picked up and salvaged despite  wishing really to simply go to bed. Clean floo, shelves and the very many things splatter. Look at beer and incredible head and gape at thickness of what slowly comes out of bottle.
Earthy, deep, rich but not erally sweetly so as the bitterness adds a somewhat tannic quality. To have a beer when none is wanted and enjoy it this much speaks volumes. See also: not crying over spilled beer.","austin, Tejas, Texas, USA","fly"

Aroma: Alcohol is potent and is the initial aroma I receive when pouring. This eventually fades and develops some smoke, sherry, chocolate, grape and oak notes. Extremely complex aroma that is very pleasant but in your face and doesn't fade at all throughout the session. Awesome.

Appearance: Pours with no head whatsoever. Dark brown, rubyish color.

Flavor: Chocolately and oaky with a medicinal quality which fades rather quickly, leaving a great nutty malt flavor. No hop.

Mouthfeel: Some alcohol warmth, but its not unpleasant considering the high ABV. Very thick, chewy.

Overall: Excellent beer. It only gets better as it ages in the bottle or sits in the glass during a drinking session. It starts out in the glass with a not-so-aggressive character, then eventually its no holds barred on the olfactory senses. Definitely try this if you can, you won't be disappointed.","Pennsylvania, USA","beermaniac"

502,"2003-12-12",4.6,"Batch 57. Pours a dark brown with puffy off- white head. Smells like a belgian strong, with lots of fruit and hint of smoke. Has a flavor all its own. Begins a with a blast of sweetness, but very quickly smoked chocolate pummels the palate. Finish is long, mostly dry with lots of tobacco notes, almost burns going down, but touches of sweetness keep this beer enjoyable. Body is enormous. An incredibly potent and unique beer.

502,"2003-12-03",4.1,"I have been wanting to try this forever.  Had a bottle after work last night.  Pours a dark mahogany with blonde highlights.  The colossal head forms without much cascading, and just sits there on top of the brew staring at me.  The tan head is the color and consistancy of a Coke Icee.  The nose is very complete with alcohol predominating, figs, anise, coffee, berries, plums, and raisins.  This brew is literally bursting with flavor.  The brew starts very sweet and warm in the front, transitioning to a moderately acidic middle.  The finish is long and roasted.  The full body is creamy, fizzy, and feels a bit cloying at the finish.  A bit sweet for my liking, but a solid brew nonetheless.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"

Batch # 56 – A fresh one, courtesy of Sham.
Ok, Ron I had a little different experience. This particular Adam poured an exceptionally dark crimson brown body and a dense respectable two-finger toffee colored head. The aroma is intense, winter spiced apple cider, prune juice, caramel, overly ripened bananas, carrot cake, Amazing! A thick creamy palate, prickly on the tongue…. The flavor is full and toasty, Big chocolaty malt likeness. I also pick up on raisins, figs, plums, a dark herbal tea rendering, notes of chewing tobacco  …. This is an intense and amazing creation!
 I can’t wait to let my other bottle age for several months and then rerate this brew.

Poured a huge head that took forever to die down. I actually had to scoop a bit out.Dark murky brown. Aroma is of raisins and figs with an overall earthiness.

Overall a pretty unique brew with alot of character.","Cape Coral Waterfront Wonderland, Florida, USA","BierBauch"
502,"2003-11-25",3.8,"Pours with a huge head that takes a long time to dissipate. Aroma is of dark fruit and alcohol. Flavor is of rich dark fruit, leather, and a slight alcohol. A bittersweet chocolate mixes with the fruit in the finish. The heavy carbonation lightens up what would otherwise be a very heavy and hard to drink beer. Very nice.","Silver Spring, Maryland, USA","jeffin7"
502,"2003-11-21",4.1,"Batch #54.  I had great expectations for this beer.  It poured a dark brown color with an ENORMOUS amount of foam.  Never seen a beer with this much head - went everywhere and couldn't stop it.  I think I got about 9oz out of the 12oz bottle.  skip ahead about ten minutes...  Not much lacing on the glass.  The aroma was extremely malty with other aromas being fruits and some chocolate.  The flavor was a little too strong at first, but very good once I became used to it.  The flavor is malty with hints of chocolate, just like the aroma.  This is a very thick bodied beer, but surprisingly smooth.  The alcohol is moderately apparent as well.  I really liked this beer once I got over the initial kick.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","clvand0"

I dug a bottle of Batch 48 out.  Very full head that grew so huge I had to let the head subside in order to pour the rest of the bottle.
Dark brown color--like a stout but a touch lighter.  Very prominent hop nose with barleywine maltiness in the smell--BUT NOT THE TASTE.  I see lots of other people commenting on carmel and malt--I don't get much of that --it's a solid blend of smokiness/mustiness (like peat smoked malt if you've ever brewed with it).

So I guess I really needed to age this, at least that's my assumption. Sadly, I found it to take a too much fortitude to get through the whole glass; I felt like it was something my mother made drink as a kid when I was ill. It's very bold - vinous with dark fruit, coffee, smokey and musty with an astringent finish.

Very attractive, very, very dark brown with creamy off white head that is fully retained.  Flavor is tasty and fully developed.  Flavor is initially sweet, then broadens and expande significantly.  There are hops in there and the finish is almost eternal.  Definite alcohol burn on the way down, though one does not taste the alcohol.

This brew may be a little to complex for my taste.  The beer looked very much like a cola in the glass.  The  head ,light brown, setteled fast leaving a minimal lace  floating on top for the duration.  The aroma was slightly musty with an earthy rasin, licorice sent.  The taste was where the complexity came in.  A woody, whisky taste with a hint of malt sweetness.  The carbonation was  a little agressive for such a flavor.  The ending was thin and oily with an alcohol bitterness.  Over all intense, I will try one again.","Hawley, Pennsylvania, USA","tidiaguy"

Deep, dark brown with plum highlights under a huge grayish-tan head, barely controlled by an extremely careful and slow pour.  Phenomenal head retention for such a strong brew!  Stunningly complex aroma of treacle, dark fruits, mesquite wood, caramel, and spice under a heavy blanket of smoke.  Astonishingly aromatic and rich.  The flavor is like nothing Ive encountered.  Dark fruits (plums, prunes, raisons, red grapes, figs), cedar and mesquite wood, chocolate, roasted malts, and caramel weave in and out under a thick layer of smoke.  Begins slightly sweet and fruity, then turns spicy on the finish.  Little-to-no hop presence.  Smallest hint of alcohol on the finish, as the 10% is really well hidden.  The mouthfeel is medium in thickness, with a smooth roundness.  A unique and singular brew, Ive love to try some well-aged vintages.  I could spend an entire day analyzing this beer.  Wowjust wow.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MarkR"
502,"2003-10-29",4.6,"Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, bought at Stuffed Sandwich in San Gabriel, CA 9/9/03.  Batch #34.  Pours with very little, slate-gray head that disappears completely very quickly.  Slight action of carbonation, and even a little bit of lacing for awhile, but this stuff looks thick and oily.  Very dark brown, almost black, with lots of sediment.  Smell is amazing, fruity and sweet (plum?) with a literally intoxicating maltiness.  Smells slightly acidic, like grape juice.  Hints of chocolate, lots of berry.  I only wish there were a head to give up a little more of this amazing aroma.  Body is incredibly full-- even puts the World Wide to shame-- creamy and, again, oily.  Taste is immediately malty, very sharply fruity on the edges and back of the mouth, and subtly dark roasted with a hint of bitterness.  Time, air, and new sips reveal new olfactory and taste experiences, like I felt once that I was drinking a liquefied chocolate truffle.  Delicious flavors, all.  Still plum, berry, and now dark malt and something reminiscent of ash with a tiny hint of smokiness.  Feel the alcohol immediately-- not only is it warming in the throat and belly, but it also made me gasp once or twice.  Perfectly smooth finish, very long but mellowing and subtle with the malts, smokiness, and oiliness hanging around most prominently.  Increasing bitterness through the bottle, and this stuff sucks all of the moisture off of your tongue as it takes over your taste buds.  Gotta keep the tongue moist by taking in and savoring another swig!  This stuff is fantastic right now (after years of aging), and although I haven't tried other batches, I don't think this beer can get any better.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

The appearance is something to behold, it looks like a jewel poured into a glass, the presentation in the glass is entertaining and lively.  The aroma is not as complex as the flavor, but comes across as very winey, and very much like a port in appearance, aroma and taste.  Lots of fruit flavors at first, with some overtones that are slightly coffee like and then the aftertaste is roasted, like it had been made with chicory.

Generous beige head that sticks to the glass like glue, every bubble is ultra-small and identical to its neighbor. Complex aroma reminiscent of port wine, grapes,licorice, plums, alcohol. Mouthfeel is creamy with a medium to full body. Very complex. Theres just a little bit of everything in that beer it seems. Plenty of malty fruitiness with figs, plums, raspberries without neglecting brown sugar, smokey chocolate, nuts, spices. I hate to say it, but Et Cetera... Thats very big and deep stuff, but anyone would like it I believe. A lot of fresh hops character contributes to the intensity. The aftertaste is great, delicate, hoppy, but almost not bitter, superbly warming and pleasant. Out of this world balance considering the enormous quantities of malt and hops. MartinT had warned me this was religious stuff-> RIGHT ON! Probably the best beer to ever cross my glass. I bet this ages well too. At 4.12, this is almost under-rated.

OK...although that would be a cool review.  This beer does have serious carbonation, leaving a thick, slowly dissipating tan head over the murky (cloudy) brown-red body.  Very potent aroma of caramel and toffee swirled with prune syrup.  I keep wafting this vaporized bread pudding towards my nose.  Impressive spicy-earthy hops profile complements the toffee and prune flavors.  Picture barleywine flavor but the tightly carbonated body of a belgian strong ale.  This could be a function of age too.  A single shot of this beer would yield a near-perfect rating.  As it stands, the alcohol could be toned down slightly for my tastes.

Alcohol is also detectable in the aroma. This is a beer I could just sit here and smell and still think I'm drinking it. Flavor is extremely smokey with notes of burnt chocolate and coffee, a very nice use of chocolate malt in this. The smokiness is slightly overpowering but the alcohol pulls up the back and warms you up as you drink it. It has a very full body with a comparable mouth feel, slightly sour and bitter.

Batch 1
This sort of indulgence is what I travel for anyway, so when its in front of me this time, the decision to finally try this rare gem is actually an easy one to make. The bottle is brought out to warm up. 15 minutes later its cracked open and the first few whiffs are discouraging as the oxidation is overwhelming. I fear that this may have been a mistake. But with some time and aeration it begins to blossom, and the rich leather, peat and tobacco that define Adam begin to crawl out of the glass, eventually in concentrations large enough to overtake the oxidation. Adambier #1 is exceptionally dry and has an invigorating, prickly, lingering finish  the longest Ive ever experienced with an Adam. The beer is past its prime for sure, and the oxidation is obviously heavy, but it tends to work in ways similar to decades-old bottles of Thomas Hardys, complimenting (and maybe even enriching) the dark fruit earthy malt character, though the dryness is certainly unlike any vintage Hardys or J.W. Lees bottles Ive had. As objective as I can be with this brewery (which is not very), Adam batch 1 is undoubtedly a delicious experience and Im glad it happened.
Batch 44 Brew Date: 02-01-2000 Bottling Date: 03-23-2000 Consumed: 03-2008 (8 years cellared) Thanks to Schroppfy for sharing. Im not sure if its faded somewhat after this much time, but theres certainly a ton of the sticky tobacco, olive and plum resinous malt left in this one, and even some hoppy scents and mild bitterness as well. Its a beast that stands up to aging, although I prefer Adam between 1-3 years old.   Batch 55 Brew Date: 06-12-2002 Bottling Date: 08-14-2002 Consumed: 08-2004 (2 years cellared) Dark garnet and ruby brown colored body, mild opaqueness when poured delicately from the bottle, with a salt-and-pepper and toast colored splotchy dark tan head, moderately thick and foamy. Initial smell of this vintage is green olives and peppery, toasty yeast. Palate is somewhat abrasive at first, with very full flavors of pine, oak, whiskey, and even a small anchovy note. This is a good example of one of the less-than-stellar batches (or perhaps bottles) of Adam  its brash, assertive and hearty, but still hints at the core of what Adam is, and at what some cellar time will do - the bouquet of roasted plums and wood especially. This batch is fantastic but does not garner a 5.0 it is the next review that represents the best batch Ive had, properly aged of course.   Batch 60 Brew Date: 08-2003 (estimated) Bottling Date: 11-2003 (estimated) Consumed: 03-2006 (2.5 years cellared) The head is a multicolored cinnamon, salt and pepper creation, sometimes thick on the walls of the glass and other times thin as a few molecules floating on top of the body. The smell of this one is divine  what could be the finest aroma Ive ever sensed  simply phenomenal... full of cedar, plums, black cherries, earthy, gritty scents, peppery, dusty yeast, and freshly tilled peaty soil. Moderately thick body, full of carbonation, but also warming the tongue and throat with a velvety coating of sherry, amaretto and rich, sweet pipe tobacco. An amazing experience, and every time I drink Adam it just gets better and better.   Batch 61 Brew Date: winter 2004 Bottling Date: spring 2004 Consumed: 08-2008, 4.5 years cellared Some acetic notes in the nose, along with heavy peat, smoke, scotch, leather, etc. Rich and robust flavor, tannic dryness across the back... rich toffee, black tar tobacco, rich leather. Really good, but very very different from nearby batches. Not the best version, but kind of surprising that its only 1 or 2 batches before what I consider some of the best batches of Adam.   Batch 62 Brew Date: spring 2004 Bottling Date: summer 2004 Consumed: 06-2008 (4 years cellared) Maybe the most amazing nose Ive ever had out of an Adam... incredibly rich and deep roasted plum, red grape, dry, charred oak, amazingly deep and rich, coats the mouth with a velvety layer of sensuous excitement. Amazingly rich, full-bodied, wondrously roasty and heavy with dark, roasted fruit. Astonishing. One of the best batches Ive ever had.   Batch 63 Brew Date: summer 2004 Bottling Date: fall 2004 Consumed: 06-2008 (4 years cellared) Heavy tobacco-resin covered dark fruit, char, smoke, peat, amazingly deep and invigorating nose. Velvet smoothness and bright, active alcohol at the corners of the palate. Amazing softness, richness, and roast could even suggest imperial stout... this more and more seems like a beer than Pannepot will become, years of experimentation and development, decades of internal variation and character. Grab some batch 3 Pannepot these days and have it taste like batch 3 Adam in 12 years. Do it.   Batch 65 September 2008 Nose is extremely hearty, rich and meaty, with heavy notes of tobacco and blood sausage. Plums and black cherry skins are all over this thing. Pipe tobacco and resinous charred fruit are divine. Wonderful stuff, perhaps a bit on the fruity side, still with some citrus hop character present. Chocolate covered cherries... mmm.   Batch 68  October 2008 2-3 inch brown cola colored head. Body is dark plum red. Nose is rich blood scented plums and sweet pipe tobacco, and the red and black cherries and rich, sweet chocolate syrup is exceptional. Huge, rich and frothy, a bit of some burnt, arcid charred chocolate and dry, charred wood, maybe the most char-heavy Adam batch Ive had. Exceptionally long finish, oily, roast-heavy, dry and parched, bitter but still slightly sweet. Divine.   Batch 70 (?) Bottling Date: mid-to-late 2007? Consumed: 03-2008, probably 6-12 months old. Another one shared by Schroppfy, this time as a comparison to the 8 year old batch 44. Huge dry hopped grassy nose of hops, with alcohol, plum wine, vegetal olive and sticky malt scents. Amazingly vibrant, fresh, chewy, resinous - this beer is the definition of resinous - really damn good, I liked a lot of what this beer had better than the 8 year old bottle, actually.

502,"2003-06-25",4.8,"Color was not what I was expecting, so it was a nice surprise to see it pour into the glass very dark brown, very thick and creamy looking, its almost black. Growing tannish head with lots of divets and thick foaminess.

Smells of a heavy roasted malt, deep chocolate with some spicey hop notes. What a sniffer, you also smell the strong % of alcohol. Put spiced vodka in with a chocolate - chocolate chip cookie mix and you'd get this smell. Well maybe.

Taste is outstanding. Super complex. Super smooth and syrupy. Is very earthy and deep. Hugely done, heavily roasted malt, giving the all around chocolate taste a deep, sweet feel of a dark chocolate. Has a bit of spice from hops that balances well.

Has many levels of feel, but I think earthly creamy/syrupy is the overall on this bad boy. Has some dryness and sweet tingley things going on in there as well. Complex city.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

It's way, WAY over carbonated, and I got a glass full of foam, and only 1"" of actual beer in the bottom of the glass. It was poured cold, but by the time the damn foam settled down, it had gotten warm on me. I hate warm beer. Anyway, it poured out black as coal. Not brown in any sense of the word, but black. Dark tan head that won't quit. I had to scoop it out with a spoon, just to get a taste of beer, and not foam. Strong aroma of alcohol hits you right off the bat, with dried prunes, dates, and other dark fruits coming in a close second. Slight note of hops in the background. Tastes strongly of malts, with a roasty flavor to it as well. Charcoal flavors in it as well. Chalky, and dry finish to it.

Flavor is over-the-top smokey, with dates and figs present, cherry notes, only the slightest bit of sweetness, and a pretty bitter, hoppy finish.  Carbonation is pretty obvious, maybe a bit too much.

Pours dark brown / black with thick tan head that takes a few minutes to subside.  Lacing is good and slight head lasts until the end.  Aroma is sweet and fruity with malts and raisins.  Taste is rich with chocolate, alcohol, fruits, malty.  I wish I remembered my original tasting of this beer, but I didnt much care for this batch.  Alcohol is much too strong in the finish and the smoky flavors that I previously detected are missing.  Its tough to go from a 3.9 to a 3.4, but I will revisit this as I usually love Hair of the Dogs brews.  This batch just missed the mark. Re-rate: 7/4/6/3/14 3.4
Had from bottle on April 18, 2003 at the Suffed SandwichWow.  We bought a nice large bottle to share amongst the table and I was pleasantly surprised.  You can definitely smell the aroma of hops and smoke.  The appearance is also quite nice - absolutely no head with a garnet coloring.  The beer has a very strong flavor with a strong, smoky aftertaste.

502,"2003-02-27",3.1,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2003 (5May2003--re-rate--batch 51) Ay caramba!  Hands down the most disgusting concoction I've ever poured down my throat.  Two sips and down the drain.  Tastes like fermented cucumber skins with chunks of yeast.   Is it quality control at the brewer, or Trader Joe's?  Yuck!
<hr>
(27Feb2003-- 51)
Certainly an interesting way to cap off my hundredth beer here.
Shopping for brews at Trader Joe's, I missed this one many times, until I saw the $1.99/bottle price.
Expensive enough for there to be something inside!
Pours thick, deep ruby brown, with a heavy yeast load.
Strangely, almost no head develops initially, even with vigorous direct pouring.  But then a cascade of extremely fine bubbles rushes forth to make a pretty, but small crown.
Head is mostly receding, though the carbonation is somewhat active and persistent.
Pungent, vinuous aroma, dominated by a plum-like smell.
Initially silky mouthfeel; warming, though not overpoweringly alcoholic.
Sourness is strong, and grows in intensity as the beer progresses.
A persistent smokiness develops, almost as pronounced as in a pure rauchbier.
Not terribly astringent or bitter.  Quite dry.  Plums and raisins, with a fairly
low level of maltiness (molasses).
Carbonation is insufficient; beer finishes flat, with the sourness dominating.
From the variance in descriptions here, you'd think that people were trying 40 different beers.
This particular bottle (batch?) is fucked up.  Complex, interesting, but fucked up.","Stanford, California, USA","mpbro"

The appearance is deep, dark red, without any head to speak of, which gives nothing away about what it will taste like.  There is an intense, alcohol and oak aroma to this brew.  The flavor seems like a mix of barley wine and apple cider, with some roasted malts thrown in for good measure.  The finish reminds me very much of red wine.  Highly unusual.  Most certainly an experience. - original 3.8 - re-rate, batch 57 - this beer must change a great deal from batch to batch, because this batch is devoid of the vinous qualities, and instead has an intense, smokey, scotch ale flavor, combined with the flavor of an excellent, well-aged barleywine - I like this batch better.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

502,"2002-12-07",4.3,"Dark red, approaching black, with a little white lace but no head at all.  Hard to be sure that it is a beer or ale just by looking at it.  First impression sipping is wonderful flavor and great big mouth feel.  Sweet dark malt, and bitter hop, followed by caramel, clove, and banana (? surpringing in a barley malt, much more common in a wheat beer).  Nice hoppiness in the long bitter finish.  Alcohol is very present.  Would have rated it higher, except that the alcohol content limits its drinkability ... not a good lunch beer or a session beer with a colleagues.  More of a knock me out at the end of a long week sort of brew.  I would have rated it much higher if it were an easier drink, instead of a sip and study beer.  Still, well worth study, an absolutely tops American ale, and probably better than a rating of 4.1 would suggest.  // Rerate 7 December.  I rated it too low just because it is not a food or a session beer.

The aroma contains notes of many things... a light splash of red wine vinegar stands out, but there are bursts of prunes and milk chocolate and alcohol. The appearance is that of prune juice, plain and simple. Not attractive... not unattractive. Almost no head nor lacing. High marks on flavor. Originality abounds. Sweet and tart, with prunes, milk chocolate and rich caramel up front. Well-balanced and tart on the backside. Warm alcohol is present from start to finish. Soft carbonation.

My first though was that it was too tangy and tart.  It has a great sense of warmth and the alcohol is fairly well hidden.  My problem with this beer was that the appearance was just not appealing.  Dark cloudy and wisps of floating sediment were all negative too me.  Also the beer had very little head and lacing.  This may taste better with age , but it was just a little strong.

502,"2002-12-02",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2003 [BATCH 53]   This beer seems so innocent sitting there on the shelf with that blank expression, just waiting to knock your unsuspecting ass over. I prefer not to read others' ratings before rating a beer myself so I figured (from the percentile) that this would be another excellent ale - full of hops and malt but nothing outrageously unusual; how wrong I was. I now understand (from the few HOTD beers I've had) that this brewery is nothing ordinary. The Adam pours a deep murky burgandy absolutely void of any carbonation, there is plenty of currant and alchohol on the nose. After taking a sip the currant stands out right away, accompanying this is a kind of salty muskiness you'd find in a good wine. This is an excellent palate beer. However, my only complaint, and it's a small one, is how the alchohol is a bit too prevalent for my tastes. I feel like every time I take a sip there is a burst of flavor which is quickly lessened by the alchohol presence. But, as I said, this is a small complaint. A wonderful beer that deserves solitude when drinking.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

First thing you notice when you take a sip is the fruity/chocolatye sweetness (yes, hugely malty), leading into some nice coffee roastiness, then quite a bitter acidic finish, Belgian style sourness in here aswell, another amazing quality of this beer. A touch winey, a touch oaky, a touch citric, a touch of spice, even a touch smokey and perhaps a bit earthy. yep its complex, the palate wasn't as round as i would have liked, but theres so much good stuff happening in here, that it didn't really take off to many marks.

Malty aroma with considerable complexity in the mouth: early smokey and malty, then chocolatey and brandy, some vinuous notes, and the sweetness lingering on in the late finish.

502,"2002-06-20",4.7,"This session was designed to test some Traditional Ales.  Maybe a bad idea.  Midas Touch and Adam are birds of a completely different feather and no doubt Midas seems sweeter and Adam more bitter, because of their proximity to each other.  Im going to rave like a madman about Adam, but now you know that Midas helped me to these golden conclusions ... In the first place, when you pour Adam you can say to yourself, now this is a head!  Big, frothy, subsiding into a glorious shaded brown cream. It hangs around delightfully through the experience.  The beer itself is a fascinating color - A rich purply brown, clouded and mysterious as hell.  The aroma is lovely - fresh cedar shavings and whiskey malt, maybe some milk chocolate, too.

But as it warmed, and I warmed, a great range of flavours arrayed themselves before my awestruck palate - all those from the aroma and then some!This is more than a beer; it is a liquid dream symbolic of the majesty and will of the first night human beings danced around a woodfire, celebrating their discovery deep and full throated in song.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
502,"2002-06-19",4.2,"Bottle from batch #52.  A solid dark brown appearance with a quickly fading head. As I finish the glass I just think the word solid stands out in my mind.  This beer is at the same time complex and surprisingly simple.  I may need to drink 11 more of these to pierce the veil of its mystery.  It is heavy, full-bodied, woody, and real joy to drink.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"

502,"2002-06-08",3.9,"I want to try this beer on a cold day, definitely not a summer brew.  Sick head!  HUGE!  Fruity aroma, flavor left a little to be desired....it was complex but something seemed to be missing.  I got the fruits, alcohol, molasses maybe?  Needed something to tie it all together better...great beer though.","Katy, Texas, USA","Andrew196"
502,"2002-06-08",4.1,"I had to wait until my friend Adam came over before we could sample this.  The head retention was absolutely ridiculous.  I was finished with this stuff and there was still about 2.54 centimeters of head.  The aroma was unique - smoky, slightly woody?  Maybe some fruitiness.  The flavor was excellent, with components of caramel, slight citrus.  The aftertaste is more-ish, as Michael Jackson would say.  A wonderful beer, too bad I could only get my hands on one bottle.","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"
502,"2002-06-08",4.8,"An intense, extremely creamy dark ale. Complexity is the hallmark of this beer, with notes of plum and dates, chocolate, smoke, peat, and coffee. For me, its an absolute necessity to lay this beer down for a few months before I have a bottle.  Some will argue that oxidation detracts from Adam, but I dont think there are many beers more suited to its effects.  (Its also quite tasty with vanilla ice cream.)","Portland, Oregon, USA","Troobie99"
502,"2002-06-08",4.3,"Batch #51: Yowza! This beer is challenging. Lots of raisins, plums, dark chocolate, roasted malt. I taste a lot of Special B in this, although Im not sure thats what they used. Almost zero carbonation. Subtle alcohol aroma but no alcohol flavor. Less body than I was expecting, although hardly thin or watery. Fairly sweet. Moderately bitter. Tongue numbing after a while. Lets all chug a liter and sleep for a day!","San Francisco, California, USA","mwsf"
502,"2002-06-06",4.2,"A liquid dark chocolate color. Aroma of roasted malts, oak barrel used for aging scotch. Prune schnapps and blueberry syrup flavor, rich and thick. Very little carbonation. Makes me wish I was in a cabin in the mountains on a cold winter night.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
502,"2002-06-05",3.2,"Very smooth malty brew. The high Abv% was masked well, just a little to chewy and malty for me...although its probably not the best brew to sample during the summer in South Florida. Thanks to Beerlimey I can give this one another shot.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Davhgbrew"
502,"2002-06-04",3.9,"Very tasty. I would compare it to Dogfish Heads Imort Ale. Just slightly less complex than that, The Adam has a more pronounced alcohol flavor and is heavier in body.","USA","Rib Eye"
502,"2002-06-01",3.2,"It poured with a huge head. Its very sweet. As others have noted, it would go well w/ chocolate. Also, the alcohol is very apparent. It does have a sweet taste to it. This is a unique brew.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
502,"2002-05-26",4.1,"A very fine dark ale.  A slight hoppy nose, a dark murky brown color, with a massive light brown head that lasts and lasts.  Great range of complex flavors that I still havent sorted out.  Not for wimps.","Portland, Oregon, USA","AxeMaster221"
502,"2002-05-26",4.1,"Deep, deep purple; Head was fluffy with medium bubbles and great retention- great lace as well. Slight tartness to start. Becomes grapy right away. Alcohol well hidden in this one. Grapiness stiks around for a while. The alocohol does catch up a bit at 2/3 mark. Hops are of the aroma variety apparently. Malt definitely defines this beer.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
502,"2002-05-25",3.2,"Dark porter-ish color with a sweet port aroma.  The alcohol is very apparent in Adam --more even than in Thor, which has 16% abv.  Its a lot like what I tend to think of as a barley wine -- over sweet, strong, alcohol-y.  It has a roasty finish, and the alcohol is present all the way from start to finish.","Washington DC, USA","Kathy"
502,"2002-05-23",3.9,"Deep black with little head.  The aroma is rich and reminds me somewhat of fullers london porter -- alcohol, fruity and malty.

502,"2002-05-07",3.5,"UPDATED: JUL 5, 2014 Bottle (Batch 92).

Head is initially huge, frothy/creamy, light brown, mostly lasting.
Body is dark brown to black.

Aroma is moderately to heavily malty (dark chocolate, toasted grain/nuts, caramel), moderately hoppy (resin, grapefruit), with notes of raisin, date, alcohol.

Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Full body, watery/syrupy/velvety texture, lively/soft carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic.

Looks good and smells very nice, but its just too sweet and boozy to drink much of.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
502,"2002-05-06",4.8,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2008 I cant believe how incredible this is new(ish) - Batch 69 up now. But older Adams? Say 5 or 6 years old? Phenomenal. 
I can certainly see the appeal of this one, and the world class stature seems well deserved. Smell of aged oak barrels and smoke, a little sweetness. Oh, the taste fulfills all of those expectations and more, with a supple feel, quite carbonated but not overly so. A tiny bit of tart cherry mixed in there?","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
502,"2002-05-06",4.2,"Nice rich aroma.  Flavors of caramel and molasses with a balanced sweetness.  Finishes slightly sweet and leaves you wanting another sip.  A great beer.","Acworth, Georgia, USA","belgianhomebrew"
502,"2002-05-03",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 23, 2004 Dark brown. Very malty, very rich. Potent, fruity and complex. Somehow I get the feeling however that this beer is like listening on your favourite music in a bad set of headphones.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
502,"2002-05-01",3.7,"I did notice all of the different flavors, but that does not necessarily make a good beer.  I found it to be rather mixed up, and did not like the burnt-bitter finish.  Not bad, better than many, but overall not one of my favorites.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
502,"2002-04-22",4.4,"Great big taste in a little 12 oz bottle, although the last oz is mostly yeast. Very dark with a big list of aromas like a trappist ale. The alcohol is high but pretty well masked. I took my time with this one. So many flavors as I sipped on!","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
502,"2002-04-17",4.2,"If NASA were to create a beer that tasted like every great beer at once this would be it.  I am still shocked by the range of flavors contained in this one beer.  First, its like a great Belgian, then a smokey ale, and finally finishing like a mild imperial stout.  Very unique.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","MikeF"

502,"2002-03-27",3.6,"A hard-hitting ale. Certainly a sipper, dark and smooth- low carbonation.  Hints of choco-coffee and roasted fruit. Good for this genre, but not my bag.","Chicagoland, Illinois, USA","popilius"
502,"2002-03-19",4.7,"Batch No. 48 -- This is a big, 10% alcohol by volume ale that is bottle conditioned and will actually improve with age. This ale can be laid down for a few years, if one has the patience to wait a while before drinking a good beer. In flavor, this beer is a complex blend of roasted malt, fruit, chocolate, coffee, and caramel flavors -- all pleasingly presented -- and finishing warmly with a satisfyingly long bitter bite. Despite its sweet smell and flavor, this is a bitter beer after all, having an IBU rating of approximately 60 (about five times more bitter than Budweiser, for example), putting this beer in the low-end of the bitterness range defined by an Imperial Stout style of beer.","Pico Rivera, California, USA","maxhits"
502,"2002-03-13",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 12, 2005 Fruity chocolate smell, very appealing. Good flavor. Wow, this is 10%! Amazing.

ReRate: Batch #31, 2-11-05. Thin head. Almost opaque brown/purple color. 
Aroma is smokey, dark chocolate. Tastes of dark fruits and chocolate with a prevalent smokiness in the background. Great mouthfeel, not harsh in any way. Texture is coating. Great.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
502,"2002-03-08",4.9,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2004 Very nice complex old ale.  A great fireplace have a cigar, conversation ale. I just had batch 41 and just came to realize I t I still have a few batch 26 still in waiting. I have now found my 4.9 brew - nearly perfect.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
502,"2002-03-04",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2014 Very dark, murky and mysterious. Full bodied yet not sticky. Very fresh with a slight fruitiness to it.

502,"2002-02-27",4.7,"UPDATED: JUN 24, 2009 2/27/2002- Not really my style of beer, but it has a unique strong taste.  Each sip differs and the flavors, while intense, are very warming.  A nice sipping, after dinner beer.
6/23/2009- Served a little colder than it should be....Pours a deep brown hue with a wonderful tan head that lasts.   The head sticks to glass as the liquid is slowly absorbed into my mouth.   Aromas of roasted nuts, figs and a touch of licorice root.  Mouth feel is medium to full bodied with flavors of anise, oak, cocoa, tobacco and more oak.  It kinda has notes of peppers, without the spice.  Very nice.... Still one of my all time favorite brews.    Very mellow for the alcohol content.","San Diego, California, USA","Sickboy282"
502,"2002-02-24",4.1,"This is an extremely challenging beer.  The aroma is sweet and alcoholic, and not nearly refined as the flavor. Each sip differs from the last and seems to make a cycle.  I get sweet fruit (plums and raisins), estery berry tastes, alcohol, and about every fourth sip a blast of smoke.  There is also a balanced hop bitterness that seems to lie just under the sweet finish.  This beer has a persistent but low degree of carbonation, unlike some high gravity beers that either have none or start out fizzy and go flat.  I cant remember the last time I have been challenged this much by a beer, but it is worth the effort.  I dont think I will have another one of these too soon, but it is an extremely satisfying experience.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"

502,"2002-01-16",4.0,"Smells like dark chocolate, very rich and rewarding.  Initial flavor is intense smokiness with some fruits in the back.  Alcohol is quite strong, but at 10% thats expected.  Very dark, but not much in the way of a head.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
502,"2002-01-07",3.6,"I hate to knock a beer with this reputation, but there are some problems for me.  For those who are interested, Im rating batch # 51. The initial aroma and taste is that of a good porter.  Roasted malt and some piney hops.  As it warms a bit it becomes more complex with dark fruits (raisins and prunes) showing through in the flavor profile.  The major problem I have here is the alcohol flavor, which is quite apparent and not well hidden.  The color is that of a porter as well - deep brown with a moderate light brown head.  HOTD gets points for originality and complexity, but I did not at all enjoy the prevelance of alcohol in the flavor.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

502,"2001-12-18",4.5,"Another great beer from Hair of the Dog, this beer keeps well and should be drunk at 55 degrees to really get the flavor.  Then most beers should be drunk a cellar temperature.  This is great stuff.","McKinleyville, California, USA","gwfrankpsu"
