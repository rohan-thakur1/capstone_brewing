749,"2012-08-10",3.7,"Received in a trade with RBald42. Thanks Ryan!

The beer appears hazy and rusty orange hued. Effervescence emanating from the depths of the liquid create an audible fizz. Bonus points for sound quality. The head is a dense white inch, but fades to a thin, wispy layer after only a couple minutes, leaving minimal lacing.

The scent brings a lot of fruit character, similar in some regards to a Flanders ale. A healthy malt presence, subtle citrus, mild funk, a touch of sweetness, and a general earthy quality round out the aromas.

Well, now Ive tried a roggenbier. Rye malt is quite present. The beer is fruity and a bit sweet. In contrast, flavors of rye and sourdough breads, as well as an understated funky quality balance out the sweetness. This brew is quite earthy and malty. This is my first experience drinking a roggenbier, and Im intrigued. Id definitely like to try some other examples of the style to compare / contrast.

The feel is a bit chewy, with the carbonation much less active on the palate than it appeared in the glass.

Overall, I must say that this beer is quite different than anything I have had. Unique and tasty. I appreciate the new experience this brew offers and its been fun sampling all 104 beer styles.

Smells of lemons, wheat, oranges, lots of tangy qualities, some underlying tarte like hints found in many Jolly Pumpkin beers.  Tastes of creamy sweet malt, lots of tangy hints, lemons, some underlying sourness, some wild qualities (accidental?).  The palate on this reminds me of a melted milk shake.  It is extremely velvety and enjoyable.  The finish on this is a nice balance of tarte and full bodied grain.

749,"2006-01-27",4.5,"Roggen bier, or ""rye beer"" is a unique German beer style, that is brewed with a portion of malted rye. Much like hefeweizen or wheat beer, these beers tend to be tart and refreshing, and make the perfect thirst quenching brew, and a type of beer that would match up to light fare as well as hearty fare. Burgerbraus version is a classic example brewed with 60% rye malt, pilnser malt, dark Munich malt, and something called ""Sour malt"". It is then hopped with Halletauer hops for aroma, and some balancing hop bitterness. Coming in at a modest 5.5% alcohol by volume, roggen bier is the type of beer you could enjoy a few of. 

Wolnzacher Roggenbier pours to a very hazy, deep golden color with a huge, rocky white head, and a very vibrant carbonation. This beer is sedimented with yeast, and like a hefeweizen, you should rouse the yeast, and pour it into the beer. The nose on this beer is very fragrant, with big spicy aromas of malted rye, some crisp pilsner malt aroma, and some herbal hop aromas. The palate is firm and grainy on the tongue with lots of spicy rye malt flavor, that is tart and refreshing on the tongue. There is also a pleasing sour malt flavor, that you can really pick up, and it makes this beer even more thirst quenching. Wolnzacher Roggenbier finishes with more of those spicy, grainy, and sour flavors, then ends with some nice herbal hop bitterness. 

This is a delicious, refreshing, very interesting rye beer, a style you really dont see a lot of. I enjoyed mine after doing some yard work, and it really hit the spot. I would match this one up with grilled fish as well, or even a roasted chicken or pork dish. It retails in 1/2 liter brown bottles for $3.25, and is well worth the price.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

example of the dunkelweizen style, but be ready to pour right when you open this one -- the excellent spontaneous carbonation of this beer led it to crawl out the neck of the bottle! Unique, cloudy cream soda color and tons of sediment cloud the glass to a center-opaqueness with light visible at the sides. First sniff from the bottle said ""skunk"" -- but this was totally a perceptual illusion, as aged fruity aromas of ginger and Nestea w/lemon emanate from the glass. Flavor is bountiful in fruit maltiness of a quality not far less than a top-quality Belgian brune -- with a unique German dark cerealgrain-prune twist, perhaps imparted by the rye used.

Murky orange with a forever lasting dense off-white head that has a small brown spot in the middle. This brown spot you see, is from the unholy amounts of sediment that are swimming around in the glass and in the bottle. Some are as big as a small fish and seem just as alive! Most however are more the size of the dots in the umlat in the name Bürgerbräu as printd on teh bottle. Anyhow, this head just does not quit, did I mention that? The aroma is strong. Strong borderline rotten peach, rye, and some light grassiness. It is odd, it almost smells meaty, like a beef stew. The flavor is stunning in its originality. Spicy, fruity, citrus, peach, apricot, curry (?!?!) and still some savory meatiness as in the aroma. The palate is equally as stunning, it is soft up front then blooms with some acidty kicking in late. I hav never had a beer that even approaches this one in its uniqueness.

The mud is totally opaque, murky, gunky, and quite aromatic.  The nose is bready (only hinting at rye), citrus filled, and reminds more of a german wheat than anything.  The flavors are also in keeping with a wheat, apple, slight sourness and lemony tartness.  The rye comes across as an afterthought and I have to really think about it do include it in my overall impression of the brew.  I didnt mind the murk, but the chunks were quite unappealing.  Somehow, there is a lasting and persistent effervesensce that defies the gunk, the bubbles are huge and soapy.  I cant tell how old this bottle is, but I have faith in my fav bottle shop.

749,"2004-05-30",4.0,"Cloudy dark gold pour with a nice fluffy head. Some lace. Very nice aroma. Malty. Slighly wheaty. Banana, citrus, some spices and rye come out more. The flavor follows suit. The banana is a bit more muted, spices develop into more distinct flavors: cloves. The citrusy hops are there. Rye shows up as well. Tangy palate and a nice citrusy finish. Nice.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"
749,"2004-05-29",3.9,"Hazy dark auburn, sandpaper ash mixed with burgandy. Lots of carbonation and a puffy big head with some lacing. The aroma is very malty with notes of cream, banana, clove, caramel and the prerequisite rye. The flavor is very smooth with the rye really biting through the wheat and malt body. Highly carbonated mouthfeel with a tangy citrusy tail. Very good and surprising.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
749,"2004-05-26",3.6,"This was a pretty impressive brew.  Ther wasnt an overall hallmark to the beer other than crackery character.  Bad label, lots of flocculent floaties down at the bottom 1/5 of the bottle.   Yeasty biscuits and crackers.  This beer is looking for food.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"
749,"2004-05-26",3.3,"Labels itself as a Rye beer, first real try of one other than Sunrye, which is suspect. Light orange appearance, long lasting, thin white head. fruity, banana-like aroma with some esther notes. Yeast and fruit is prominent.  Has a bit of a starchy palate which is the one flaw I find. Otherwise, an interesting little ale.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
749,"2004-05-24",3.9,"The beer was purchased in a brown, 0.5 liter bottle with a rather poorly applied label.  The beer pours murky orange with a whole lot of yeast sediment in the glass.  The head is fizzy and average sized (about ½ inch in the Pilsner glass).  The aroma is yeasty and fruity and vaguely similar to a Belgian dubbel without the spices or the brown sugar.  The taste is an intriguing one, somewhat similar to a weizen in its citrus-banana-clove-bubblegum yeast profile, but is a lot earthier and heartier as a result of the rye malt.  It has a sour-sweet doughy chewiness, and is quite sticky on the palette.  If beer is liquid bread, this one must be liquefied sticky orange buns.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
749,"2004-05-16",2.5,"This is a muddy-chunky brown beer.  Super sweet aroma and a nasty sweet aroma and flavor, like spoiled vegetables.  My bottled exploded, so I wonder if it was contaminated.  This is only for the strong willed heavy beer drinkers, to be sure.","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
749,"2004-04-11",3.6,"Wow- this pours with a potent toffee, caramel, and honey aroma.  The body is dirty orange-brown with a nice dense light tan head.  Globs of yeast sink to the bottom.  Tangy, sweet toffee flavor with toast and caramel.  Very phenolic.  Finishes sour.  Nicely carbonated.  Like all Burgerbrau beers, this is well-blended and smooth.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
749,"2004-03-28",4.2,"Head is initially huge, frothy, off-white, mostly lasting. Body is hazy light amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is heavily malty (toasted bread/grain), lightly hoppy (flowers), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of banana, clove, and honey. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. Another beautiful Bürgerbräu creation...their answer to weissbier; bigger, toastier, richer. A real treat, pity this one doesn't make it to Colorado (other than at Falling Rock once, thanks to Chris Black being a fan of this brewery!).","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
749,"2004-03-16",2.9,"Amber, with the thickest sediment I've ever seen.    Quite unappetizing appearance, huge chunks of either yeast or protein.  Spicy rye aroma, estery aleish aroma, with bits of phenols and banana.  Extremely yeasty, thick chewy mouthfeel.  Peppery carbonation.  It's interesting, but there's a bit too many distracting elements to achieve any sort of cohesion.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
749,"2004-02-17",3.7,"A very, very heavy pour, with a big frothy head.  The appearance is a dark, golden amber.  Tastes and smells like a trippel.

749,"2004-02-01",3.9,"Hazy orange color with massive amounts of yeast, has a huge tan head of very large bubbles that quickly disappear, doesn't leave any lacing either.

Finishes pretty sweet, flavor kind of dies at the end, picks up a watery character.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
749,"2004-01-28",3.6,"Aroma reminded me of a weiss beer with some maltier aromas. The beer poured with a big head that faded fast to nothing. Differnet than most rye beers I have had in that the dominate flavor is wheat yeast with the rye flavors up front. A decent beer.","Mt. Wolf, Pennsylvania, USA","warrior"
749,"2004-01-28",3.4,"Aroma of rye bread, wheat, and citrus. Appearance is murky orange with a good head and a LOAD of sediment. Flavor is quite doughy and sour with a bit of yeast. Similar to a glass of OJ. Different in many respects. Overall an ok experience.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
749,"2004-01-25",3.7,"Poured a cloudy orange with a long lasting head atop.  Nose was primarily malt and rye with some lighter fruits in the background.

749,"2004-01-09",3.1,"Cloudy pumpkin. Sharp rye malt aroma. Lingering 1/8"" foam. Tangy, dry, somewhat metallic. Extremely quaffable, simple and just not that good.

749,"2003-11-24",3.1,"Extremely muddy butterscotch. Noisy, crackling head completely dissipates. Lost half the bottle to a foam gush, which stirred the three-inch high sediment. More like a mudbier. Looks like a half-gallon of yeast was poured into my glass. Spicy Hallertau aroma with some nutty malts and buttery yeast. Hints of anise, phenols, and earth. Furious carbonation. Faint acidity and nutty yeast notes up front, followed by a leafy, light metallic zing. Finishes dry and earthy with filmy yeast and hazelnuts. Phenolic belches, to boot. Its gemlike qualities are very apparent underneath the jumbled mess of yeast, phenols, and carbonation. But that doesnt get the job done. Note: Very fresh sample.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
749,"2003-11-21",3.9,"This beer's appearance consisted of a large sized white head with fine sized bubbles that was mostly lasting. The body had a small amount of slow rising carbonation and the body was also cloudy with an orange-brown hue. The nose was fruity along with some clove and the flavor was sour and tart. The palate was smooth, fruity, watery, thin and light bodied. There was a fair amount of lacing on the sides of my glass with this beer.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
749,"2003-11-12",3.5,"THis brew poured a extremely envigorated head of fine to large sized longlasting white colored bubbles that left behind a minimal lace and a very cloudy dark yellow colored body with floating particles in it.  The aroma contains notes of fruit, spices, clove and coriander.  The mouthfeel was smotth at the start and tingly in the finish.

No rye in the aroma but it came through in the finish of the flavor. Flavor was also wheaty with some citrusy elements and some spice. Was similar to a dunkel weisse, but offered a nice complexity due to the rye. Good","Sanborn, New York, USA","IPFreely"
749,"2003-10-25",4.0,"You really need to let this one warm up a little before drinking it as it lets the rye come through in the finish. Otherwise, it comes across strongly as a hefeweizen. The beer was fresh enough that the yeast hadn't completely settled and lumped together so it was a muddy amber brown. There was heavy carbonation that formed a nice stiff head that lasted nicely. There was a bit of bubblegum and clove in the aroma and flavor. In the finish, the rye really comes out and makes a nicely spicy aftertaste. Good beer.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

Lots of yeast, weird citrus, tangy, grainy, very much like apricot nectar.  If this is how its supposed to be, then so be it.  Im going to experiment to see if my sample was over shaken, or mistreated somehow.  Drinkable, yet unusual.  Strange, yet seductively drinkable.

I added it and it went halfway into the beer in the glass and became suspended in the beer in almost a swirl pattern. The nose was somewhat typical of wheat beers, but with more spice. I did not smell any rye in this. However, you could taste the rye. The beer is basically a wheat beer with rye. Not a typical wheat but definitely recommended. The finish is a little bitter but smooth. Great beer!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"

Mild dark, plumish aromas.  Caramel malts, flowery hops, and a light smokey aroma.  Moderately sweet throughout, with a little spicey kick from the rye.  Much like a German wheat, the hops are well hidden the entire time.  Moderate acidity at the end with effervescent carbonation leaves a quenching and refreshing bite.  Medium body is watery.  The bottom line is: this is an interesting alternative to a wheat beer, if you can find it.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

This is a huge beer that transported me back to my days living in Germany sitting at a cafe with a tall glass of dark rye beer in the sunshine.  So enjoyable that it is hard to put into words. Each sip is like a huge bite, almost meal-like thickness. Balance is nice, huge rye malts and notes of caramel and wheat.  Some rye dryness and flowery hops finishes the tasty journey.  Simply amazing!","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
749,"2003-07-11",3.9,"A muddy orange color with a nice red hue.  The head is gargantuan.  An interesting aroma that is sweet, but also has a strong, spicy component, which must be rye.  As this is really my first rye, I may be wrong, but it seems to be very reminiscent of a german wheat.  Similar but also different.  Many of the same characteristics in the mouthfeel, the nose, and the flavor.  Not really banana or clove, but still tasty, some bubblegum phenols, yeast and a smooth mouthfeel.  A surprisingly great beer.  One that I was not very able to describe, but one I greatly enjoyed.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
749,"2003-07-02",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 14, 2007 Re-rate 1/11/03: Doesnt have nearly the same carbonated pour as the first rating, but I did pour it a little colder. Mostly the same as the previous rating.  Nice sweetness and rye flavor throughout.  Crisp, clean and enjoyable.

Original rating 7/2/03: Pours with a ton of carbonation, about 90%, which subsides into a hazy orange.  Light citrus aroma leads into a full palate with a smooth, good rye sweetness.  A very mellow and drinkable brew.  A true roggenbier, very unique.  I was glad to try this one.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
749,"2003-07-02",4.1,"Sediment-filled and darkly opaque, this beer looks like it came from a Bronx sewer pipe.  But fear not!  Because the taste is much more appealing.  Heavily overcarbonated, by the way, though I don't think my bottle is 'off' because it doesn't taste funky and others have commented on this beer's weird appearance.  As for its taste, you'd have a hard time telling this beer apart from a yeasty, citrusy wheat beer.  There's a lot of lemony flavor here and the rye, composing 60% of the malt, has a wheaty impact.  Probably the best Roggen I've ever had.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
749,"2003-06-24",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2003 Holy cow is this a picture of dark brown churned-up sedimentary stuff. Rye imparts a slight sourness plus some nuttiness as jskendzel mentions.

Slick rye glides on the tongue, with just enough effervesence to keep it lively. A touch of citrus late in the gulp also helps this malty monster. Its been I while since I've had a good roggenbier, and ths one sure hits the spot.
