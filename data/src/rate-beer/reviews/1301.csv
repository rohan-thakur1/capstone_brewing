1301,"2015-09-03",3.3,"On tap at highland hollow Boise pub. Pours out a copper gold topped with a sand head. Nose is malty wood sweetness and some nuttiness. Taste is more of the malty sweetness some toffee fruit and wood notes.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
1301,"2014-11-03",2.8,"On tap at the Boise BP a nice slightly hazy redish amber. Full lasting sandy head. Lots of heavy dry lacing. Rather sharp strong bitter malty aroma. Sort or chemically and harsh. I think this is a dry biting barley wine. And just an OK one","Boise, Idaho, USA","IndianaRed"
1301,"2014-04-06",3.4,"This ESB is venturing off into IPA land. Very hoppy, bitter ale, looks and smells like an IPA, velvety smooth, silky body and head. Hops hit you right up front, but malt make sit an easy drinker.","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"
1301,"2010-04-10",3.7,"On tap at the brewpub w/Gyruke. Pours a nice hazy golden orange color. Aromas of nice citrus/grapefruit hops. Flavor starts malty and the hops kick in, nice crisp bitter finish.","Fort Walton Beach, Florida, USA","oldrtybastrd"
1301,"2010-03-05",3.8,"on tap-pours a retaining off white head and amber color.  Aroma is mild citrus, light/medium malt.  Taste is citrus/pine hops, nice backbone of sweet medium malt.","Florida and, New Jersey, USA","jcwattsrugger"
1301,"2008-02-04",3.8,"Cloudy copper color.  Sweet aroma, mostly malt with a hint of hops in the background.  Powerful sweetness and rich mouth feel.  Upon tasting, one is hit with sweetness, alternating with bitterness.  The aftertaste lingers.  Seems to be a good balance between malt and hops, both strong to counteract the other.","Boise, Idaho, USA","DickDunnigan"
1301,"2007-05-24",3.9,"Interesting overhopped Pale ale, but not an IPA.  All cascade hops from what I gathered from the bartender.  Like the use of the low flocullation yeast that adds to the already interesting nose.","Renton, Washington, USA","Bradrcr"
1301,"2007-03-02",3.9,"Draft:  Hazy, almost murky amber pour with a lasting white head and solid lacing.  Aroma of mostly floral hops with a bot of hops.  Taste is full of citrus and floral hops, caramel, and malty sweetness.  Very balanced maltiness with the hops into a lingering, hops bitter tail.  Full bodied.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
1301,"2006-03-18",4.1,"This is honestly the best thing to ever come out of this bar, and by far the most enjoyable.  Great amber apperance, with great ample lacing and a wonderful bitter hop nose.  This is amazingly well balanced, some of the flavor is understated, but the finish is wonderful and lingering.  Very rich andsmooth, with a great floral aroma that tickles your nose every time you take a drink.  Very tasty!","Tacoma, Washington, USA","harlequinn"
1301,"2006-02-03",4.0,"Hazy amber with lots of lacing and sticky light head. Perfect carbonation level. Nose of malty caramel and light citrusy, nutty and rich hop notes. Very fresh and pungent. The rich flavor is awesome. So malty with caramel and bitter hop notes. Rich with lots of umami. Am I using the word rich enough? An underlying balance and extended bitter finish. Very rounded with a sweet mouthfeel. Floral and bit lighter in hops than a typical PNW IPA but a beefy body with a malty but not husky flavor. Nice!","McCall, Idaho, USA","BÃ¼ckDich"
