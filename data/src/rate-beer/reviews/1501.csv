1501,"2017-06-19",4.6,"This is Stones special 20th Anniversary release of their 6th Anniversary Porter - er, thats a tad confusing. Stone doesnt phone it in for their anniversary releases, that much is clear. This bottle had several months of age on it. Near-black color. Roasty, smoky, and earthy nose with some soy sauce. Roasted malt, smoke, dark chocolate, licorice, burnt cream, earth, herbal tobacco, and umami flavors. Feel is rich and hearty. Booze taste is cleverly hidden - you do feel a bit of heat. Its a straightforward Imperial Porter but an excellent one.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

1501,"2017-05-13",4.4,"Pours very dark brown. Frothy, tan head that lingers for the duration amidst sticky lacing. A very attractive brew. Aroma is chocolate but with notable hop undertones: lots of pine, and a bit floral. More reminiscent of a black ipa than a traditional porter. Taste is bitter, almost too bitter with the hops mostly squelching the sweet chocolate and smokey undertones, but the balance is just kept and comes out strangely all the better for it.

1501,"2017-04-28",4.2,"Po imperialnym porterze spodziewałem się ugrzecznionej wersji tego co było w RISie, jednak jest to piwo o zupełnie innym charakterze. W aromacie na pierwszym miejscu są cytrusy, na drugim natomiast czekolada i nuty palone. Przebija się też nuta mleczna, toffie. Prezentuje się pięknie, duża czapa śnieżnobiałej piany na ciemnym, prawie czarnym piwie, nie wiem jak oni to zrobili że nie jest beżowa. W smaku pierwsze odczucie to typowa porterowa paloność i czekolada, sprawia wrażenie gładkiego, by po chwili uderzyła cytrusowa goryczka, na konkretnym poziomie. Wysycenie nie za wysokie.

Bottled on: 04/11/16.

Appearance: Slips out a very dark brown body capped with an airy-looking, two inch-high layer of tan-hued foam.

Smell: A hoppy vibe of curt citrus and slackened resins atop the subtly smoke of the ashen, blackened malt.

Taste: Espresso edged malty roastiness with a light acrid, slightly astringent soot element. Minor dark fruitiness. Its firmly hoppy, playing up tastes of grapefruit and resins, overshadowing the malts, but, given the seemingly harsh roastiness of it, perhaps thats just as well. Moderately bitter. Earthy, dry undercurrent of oak wood. Hops remain abundant into the finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel.

This beer pours jet back with little head, and the aroma is very strong, bitter malt and more very strong, bitter malt. The flavor adds a little bit of dark chocolate and boozy notes, but this thing never gets sweet and never even implies sweetness. Just sledgehammer roasted malt character that never wears out or backs down.","Virginia, USA","Darwenus"

1501,"2007-02-18",3.6,"From a 22oz Bottle.  Rootbeer tinged dark brown pour with a thin layer of bubbly tan head.  Sweetish, fruity malt character thats taken on a bit of an oxidized port dimension at this time, which is able to successfully impart pleasant impressions of dried strawberries and prune flesh.  Quite light on the roast, and the fruity malt flavors are quite dominant.  Medium bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel.  An interesting dry chocolate fudge starts out on the palate, along with a light vanilla mocha chocolate roast.  A nice touch of smoked prune fruitiness accompanies before a bitter hop finale.  The amount of hop bitterness left in this is quite remarkable given the age; the hops still have some of the pithy white grapefruit character and alpha acid bitterness left over, and havent succumbed to the overly stale or vegetal state like several other beers from this generation.  Interesting brew overall, especially how the hop character seems to have aged a bit more gracefully than the malt, although the malt flavors are still solid.  Fruity, somewhat oxidized bouquet with a relatively healthy chocolate malt flavor and bitter hop finish.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

It has evolved nicely into a smoked old ale, with the chocolate and coffee notes that I recall from a few years ago more muted, and the caramel and toffee flavors more pronounced. Theres a healthy amount of vanilla and toast to this, with notes of bacon fat on the nose and palate. Its well done, and probably will continue to age gracefully.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

Lots of coffee, some licorice, light alcohol, light vanilla, chalk, and some cocoa powder.  I didnt get any oak at all, and only found out about it after reading the commercial description.

1501,"2005-06-08",3.8,"[Sampled 2 and 2½ years old] A dark red-brown beer with a huge chocolate-brown head. The aroma is sweet and slightly acidic with notes of chocolate, coffee, malt, and alcohol - nice - but a little too much alcohol for my liking. The flavor is sweet with lots of roated malt combined notes of chocolate, and coffee, as well hints of alcohol - which is more present in the mouthfeel, where it burns the tongue. The end is pretty hoppy which together with the roasted malt and coffee gives it a bitter end, though with the alchol making a clear presence. Surprisingly this is a bit over the top giving it some sour hints - but still a solid brew.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
1501,"2005-06-08",3.6,"Bottled: Very dark brown colour. Sweetness, chocolate, malt and light roast in the aroma. Roast, light hops and some cocoacoffee in the flavour. Dry and dusty in the end.

1501,"2005-04-25",3.7,"Very dark brown pour. The head is light brown, quite thin. Rather complex nose, very malty thats for sure yet with a more than healthy does of hops (orange, grapefruit, burnt wood, ashes, weed). This is all fighting side by side with mildly smoky chocolate malt, anise and wood(roots) reminiscent. Very dry palate, stone-like, the smoke hints from the aroma keep on through a harsh roastiness and dried pineapple still powerful hops. Not quite as good as the aroma fom my point of view. Full bodied, airy palate, probably too dry for what I want my porters to be, but they sure managed what they intended.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1501,"2005-03-07",3.8,"22 oz bottle, snifter.  Deep roasty chocolate is the first aroma I encounter.  Smoke, spicey hops and the protypical porter ""tang"" come across next.  Molasses, caramel, toffee, whisky aromas all play a smaller role.  Deep cola black-brown body with hints of ruby is topped by a moderately sized, frothy tan head.  Flavor starts moderately sweet with a slight bitterness.  The taste experience rounds out with a gianty dry tang, light sweetness, light acidity, and moderate bitterness.  Medium-full body, oily texture and slightly below average carbonation.  The bottom line is: Flavor doesnt have the complexity of the aroma, but this is still a solid offering...perhaps more out right drinkability than the regular smoked porter.

Opaque black pour with a deep tan head. Aroma is sweet malt with some roast and a bit of chocolate.

1501,"2005-01-29",4.0,"GABF 2004, in somebodys hotel room.  After hearing so much praise for this beer (and witnessing the paroxysims of joy when whoever brought it--Chris?--unleashed it), I must conclude that I just dont enjoy smoked beers.  This is the best one Ive ever had, but the overall rating suffers because I dont like the style (mostly affected the smell, but the flavor a little too).  Black with some hints of ruby in the less-opaque parts, a lighter head than I would expect.  Good level of roast, good level of vanilla sweetness, the smokiness was noticable but thankfully understated, full mouthfeel and creamy, long finish.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

This was one HUGE porter. The hops definately died down from the aging. This was the first tasting but it just seemed like the hops were not well pronounced but well hidden and balanced. Nice. Huge coffee flavor with some suddle chocolate and dark fruits. Alcohol was well hidden but still apparent. Very smooth and drinkable with a fantastic mouthfeel.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"

Complex nose of burnt brown sugar, ripe plums, figs, molassess and wood.  Very smooth, thick mouthfeel.  Very subtle smoke, almost like the whisps of a dying fire.

1501,"2004-09-05",4.7,"Id been hoping to hang on to this bottle for a bit, but for some reason, it just felt right to crack this out tonight. Maybe I just needed an extra excuse for happiness...
Pours out a deep, dark black, utterly impenetrable, with only the slightest cracks seeping out slight ruby reddishness, with a big, blooming, luscious tan head.
Aroma: ah! theres that smokey factor, big, but not too, with cocoa and mocha character as well, very smooth, never a bit bitter at all.
Taste: repeats the aroma, smokey character is there, all the way, as well as porter-y qualities in abundant, but not overwhelming supply. Richly roasted, fully flavored, immense in body, very mellow and groovy, with the smoke sitting relaxedly, yet firmly in charge and on top of the palate. As we continue, it settles back, this smokiness, it hangs on the back porch, still wafting its effect, but never harshly. After 16 months since the bottling this must be just the height of perfection. There cant be a thing wrong with this. Fullness, no harshness, yet with a unique flavor that never sticks you wrongly. 
Yum.
Have I said that yet?
Yum, and Ill say it again, yum-my.
Im just gonna sit back and luxuriate in this one.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied, smooth, and oily with a biting finish. Lingering hop bitterness prevails.

A touch of burnt sugar, some sharp hops and a touch of alcohol.  Dark malts all over the place.  Medium body, silky smooth.

Poured a deep black body and a highly dense kaki colored head...the lacing is full and drapes the inner glass.  The aroma that is radiating from the snifter is heavy with Scotch Whisky, like a 40 year signal barrel aged whisky. Its filled with robust suggestions of oak and dark fruits. Holly Bitch-Burger, the flavor here is insane! Damn, even after 2 years this baby is roasty and toasty with the highly kilned chocolate malts, but its very polished and refined! There is just this big bitter/sweet mouthful of earthy peat and smoke, then milk chocolate and toffee, finishes with a bitter punch of  French pressed coffee not black though, but with a bold cream and sugar... some ground vanilla-bean as well!  The punchy notes of whisky are amazing in this brew.. full of toasty malted grains. With 2 years of age, this porter presents the creamy texture and refined and robust character that defines greatness in this style!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
1501,"2004-06-01",4.5,"Mysteriously dark brown and wafting with enticing aromas. In-fricken-credible mouthfeel; intensely rich and rewarding, with a chocolaty texture. Big notes of dark chocolate and lesser notes of peat, wood, smoke, coffee cake, milk and brown sugar. The teeter-totter is steady and level, with bitter hops and dark chocolate on one end and a syrupy sweetness on the other. The perfect hint of alcohol and a healthy amount of hops (but definitely not overdone) round it out. Oh, man, great beer! Thanks, Dave!","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
1501,"2004-05-11",4.2,"Pours dark brown with amber hues and settles to a very dark beer with two fingers of tan head.  The aroma is of chocolate, smoke, raisin and is powerful enough to be smelled several feet from the glass.  The very first sensation is a strong dark port or fruit taste and then a developing smokeyness fills the mouth and throat.  A chalky feeling chocolate taste takes over as the somke begins to dissapate, and it all starts over again with the next sip.  This is a very nice beer.  Too bad it is retired.

1501,"2003-09-28",4.7,"Deep mahagony body pours with a moderate tan head that seems very dense and creamy. The head slowly fades to a more modest layer of foam that leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Sweet and fruity aromas are barely perceptible as the beer sits on the desk in front of me. Close up, a strong dark fruit and chocolate aroma similar to raspberry hot chocolate dominates the nose, but some smoky roasted notes and a bit of hops are present as well. The taste is phenomenal, with sweet malt, strong coffee, roasted malt, burnt marshmallows, and smoldering pine all assaulting my taste buds. Ghostlike alcohol esters hover above the action, filling the rest of my mouth with the prescence. But then the sultry body massages the tongue, and I seem to forget about the brash assault it just recieved. The only memory is a lingering smoked pine taste.","McMurray, Pennsylvania, USA","aaronh"
1501,"2003-09-18",3.5,"Same appearance as their smoked porter.  Much hoppier aroma, more edgy, not really smoky enough.  More on the hop side than the chocolate one.  I like the original one much better.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","SimonPatrice"
1501,"2003-09-17",3.5,"Sampled Sep 12, 2003This is a pitch black beer with notes of deep brown.  It pours with a  dark brown head which is dense, creamy and pretty persistent.  The aroma is one of malt, roasted malt with a  bit of smoke and perhaps a hint of alcohol in the nose.  There is a nice thick mouthfeel to this one, and it gently coats your entire mouth.  The finish has a hint of alcohol.  There is lots of smoky malt flavor in this beer as well.  The roasted notes remind me of coffee.  A bit of sweetness becomes evident as it warms up.  This beer feels thick, almost oily on my tongue, the smoke only reinforces this perception.  This 22 oz bottle is a meal unto itself.  Overall a fairly solid beer, I like it.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

1501,"2003-06-24",4.3,"A great porter. However, it might have gotten even higher marks from me if I weren't tasting it in 88 degree weather on a blacktop (at the Stone 6th Anniversary Open House). This gem is dark but not quite opaque (the sun shining through it cast a crimson light on the sweaty surface of my forearm). Sweet nose of caramel, malt, and even some red fruit and hops. Rich, chocolate mouth, with butterscotch and coconut notes in the lingering aftertaste. Hops are quite subtle for a Stone Brew.","San Clemente, California, USA","Smacky"
1501,"2003-06-10",5.0,"The 22 oz. bottle poured with a noble two inch pillowy head. The color was black with a deep red garnet color when held up to the light. Great head retention. The aroma was complex with malt, berry, chocolate, black licorice, and a slight alcohol presence. The taste was smoky and malty sweet with a bitter peppery finish. The smoky flavors were unlike anything Ive tasted in a beer before. Something in the flavor reminded me of a great tequilla I once sampled. And the halcyon warmth that followed was similar 
too. The mouthfeel silky andy viscous, not a bit dry and excellent

Light fights a losing battle to get through this brew.  Very dark brown/almost black.  Very chocolatey aroma, as it warms, alcohol and cherries seem to come out, too.  First, a good chocolate flavor, that fades slowly to coffee, and that fades quickly to tasting like I smell after I pass out next to the bonfire on the beach during the summer, nice and smokey.  Alcohol well masked.  Very easy to drink.  Get some if you can.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AustinMilbarge"

Interesting mouthfeel: smooth but still with the zing of some hops.  A masterpiece.","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"
1501,"2003-03-09",3.9,"Very dark.  Aroma was very roasty and smokey, subtle hops as well.  This beer could be called an imperial smoked porter for the hops and alcohol that came along with the full bodied taste.  A very complex beer, to be expected from Stone, definitely in a class of its own.  There was a slight twang in the acidic finish of this beer that kept me from rating it higher.","Katy, Texas, USA","Andrew196"

Alcohol slightly noticeable.  Nice complementation between malt and hops--a Stone beer with heavy acent on malts that created a smooth body and an enjoyable porter.","Washington DC, USA","jskendzel"

3/4/2003: Rich, deep opaque color with a sandstone head that laces well.  Caramel chocolate malt aroma with western hop character.  Flavor has good complexity, dark fruit, and a robust, viscous, somewhat silky body.  Very drk and bitter for a porter, but this helps to mask the high alcohol.

First of all, this thing pours out of the bottle beautifully...dark brown with ruby hints, and a large, thick, creamy tan head. The aroma is huge...bitter hops, smokiness, roasty-toasty. The flavor is twice as big as the aroma...hops galore, alcohol (more so as it warmed), smokiness, and a roasted character. The feel was silky smooth, yet crisp in the finish.

1501,"2003-02-07",4.1,"I like the beer.  But I agree, perhaps a bit too hoppy.  For perfection, anyway.  It's well matched by a huge roasted maltiness, and by the end of the bottle, with the concomittent softening of brain cells, I have very warm feelings for the drink.  No grim reaper, but maybe a ride with ET on his bicycle through the fields of hop flowers, before landing in a burnt grain silo.  Worth cracking open.","USA","document"

However, strengthening beers does not always make them better and I think something is lost occasionally in the translation. This beer was a dark, dark brown with tinges of ruby amber. Small but substantial head. Flavor was primarily chocolate and raisins (raisinettes?) with tinges of smoke here and there.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"

Alcohol is prevalent and finishes with a subtle hoppiness that is barely discernible over the bitter roastiness.  The roastiness comes with a touch of mint that is quite welcome.

1501,"2002-12-24",4.3,"A bit too unbalanced for my tastes as it is now, but should get better with aging. Had a cloying sweetness in the nose and finish, with a subtle smoke aroma. Not enough hop aroma and bitterness to counteract the rich, viscous body and sweet, malty flavors. Also had strong alcoholic aroma and flavor, which became more pronounced as it warmed. The alcohol overpowers other elements, namely the roastiness and smokiness. Id prefer it much more with less residual sugars (i.e. drier) and with sharper hop bitterness. If youre gonna boost the malt over-the -top, make sure to boost the hops accordingly! 
Re-rate 12/23/02: Different bottle from a different batch. This was much more balanced. Smokiness much more apparent, alcohol much more subdued, better attenuated (drier), and more noticeable bitterness. This bottle and others Ive tried more recently are much more balanced.

nice nose of tannins, raspberries, hops, smoke/peat, and juniper, among
other things.  It has a beautiful, persistent, and fluffy head

Well - it just didnt do it for me. 2nd and 3rd time trying it I enjoyed it a little more, but just not a well balanced, or very enjoyable brew overall as what I had come to expect from Stone.

1501,"2002-11-15",4.4,"I like this one alot.  Dark brown in color, the aroma had both a strong smell of malt and hops.  The taste is similiar to the aroma, well balanced between the sweetness of the malt and the bitterness of the hops.  Its an excellent beer folks.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
1501,"2002-11-13",4.1,"Wonderful dark, thick malty brew, with a thick creamy head, and aa great malty aroma.  Full of malty flavor, and just the right touch of bitterness.","Portland, Oregon, USA","AxeMaster221"
1501,"2002-11-08",4.4,"Instantly hoppy aroma, woody notes, slightly roasted, fruity with noticeable alcohol. Palate is smooth and creamy, disturbed only by the hoppy aftertaste. Alcohol warmth come in immediately on the palate, while the hops are strong in the aftertaste when served cold. As it warms complexities of chocolate, fruit and a faint smokiness come through. Pretty strong and hoppy for a porter, but then should I expect it any other way?","California, USA","BeerLimey"
1501,"2002-11-06",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2008 Bottle... This beer rocks!... Malty, smokey and floral nose. Vanilla, toffee and dark chocolate notes. Alcohol and coffee. Huge, rocky, khaki head with excellent lacing. Mostly lasting. The beer is as black as midnight, but when held up to a high power halogen bulb, it’s sparkling clear and a beautiful ruby color. Who cares, right? Someone, somewhere cares and that’s why I mentioned it. Not your average porter. Definitely a left coast porter. Hopped, baby. Hopped, I say. Lightly pungent and moderately bitter up front. Notes of espresso, dark chocolate, toffee, vanilla and a heavy helping of Hops, baby,  and warm alcohol on the backside. Full-bodied. Light carbonation with an oily mouthfeel. Long, bitter, dry finish. Lot’s of alcohol, but balanced out nicely, ok, a bit overboard, with the hop addition. Can’t wait for Stone’s 7th Anniversary. Thanks go out to herbjones for this one!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1501,"2002-11-04",4.4,"Big brown head and extraordinary lace, the beer is very dark, almost opaque. When I take a whiff of this beer I am met by a huge floral (violets) hop nose that gives way to the classic pine/citrus aromas compliments of the Pacific Northwest. The palate is very full bodied and roasty, it reminds me of burnt toast. As the beer warms, the burnt toast subsides and a rich dark chocolate flavor comes through. The finish is long with flavors of hop, tobacco, and dark berry fruit. This is one complex high gravity porter.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","HighGravity"
1501,"2002-11-02",3.1,"Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting. Body is black (but not opaque). Aroma is moderately hoppy (grapefruit), moderately malty (dark chocolate, toasted dark bread, roasted grain), with a note of cask wood and smoke. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Finish is heavily bitter, lightly sweet, moderately acidic. Medium to full body, creamy texture, lively carbonation, moderately astringent, lightly alcoholic.  Also known as Stone Grapefruit Porter.  The oak smell is readily apparent, but the smoke is about as timid as the regular Stone porter. Ultimately, its the overhopped quality that kills this one for me, as I prefer hops to take a [distant] back seat in porters and stouts.  Quite sour.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1501,"2002-10-29",3.9,"Attractive color, meaty smokey aroma, with plenty of hops as well.  Coming out of the beer fridge (50F) I am met by a powerful meaty smokiness.  The fact that this is hoppier and bigger than the regular smoked porter is very evident. Even cellar temp is not warm enough for this beer.  As the beer is not warm enough at 50F for the sweet malts to balance the meaty smokiness.  As it nears room temperature, it really comes into its own.  Bigger than the regular smoked porter, yes, better, yes, but not a lot.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
1501,"2002-10-29",3.9,"Very good beer, however I think it crosses the border form porter to stout.  A little too much roasted barley character  and too heavy a mouthfeel to fit the definition of a porter well.  Chocolatey, malty aroma with a hint of alcohol.  Smooth mouthfeel, roasted bitterness.  Not much hop aroma or flavor.  If you like beers in the porter/stout category, give this one a try.","Boone, North Carolina, USA","Brodie"
1501,"2002-10-25",4.4,"soot black, moderate smoke.  little bit of licorice, maybe a touch of black fruit. ample hop bitterness for a porter.  some alchohol flavor.  revised:  upgraded rated a little.  came around a bit / flavors seemed more integrated as it warmed up.  this beer should be served very close to room temperature - maybe 65F.  UPDATE: having a bottle at 68F - seems considerably more balanced / upgraded rating.  This beer was clearly engineered for room temperature consumption.  Dont even try unless its 60F or warmer.","USA","rich42"
1501,"2002-10-24",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2003 A very nice tasting porter.  The aroma is strong and hits you before you can even taste the greatness.  I'm not the hugest fan of porters, but this one is great - the initial taste of chocolate tempts the palate before delivering a perfect balance of hops along with a smokey-coffee flavor.  The porter is very dark black, almost opaque with a thick, dark head.  The flavors are plentiful and the porter stays with you for hours after drinking.  A must try beer - this porter has it all.","Orange, California, USA","Blake"
1501,"2002-10-20",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2005 ....And then Stone made a Porter to rival mans existence!!! The aroma is astoundingly strong, and the taste is brimming with coffee flavors. The aftertaste is one of the best i can think of off the top of my head. The color is very dark brown, blackish colour that almost cries ""drink me, drink me"". Definitely worth 4$ out of your pocket, a beautiful porter.

Re-rate 7/6/05..... Man I am seriously going to miss this beer as this was my last bottle... fairly pitch black, thick, viscous orange/tan head. Aroma is chocolate, bourbon, whiskey, and smoke. Flavors are full bodied, thick, roasty, smokey, alcohol and chocolate. Mild carbonation, heavy hop bitterness distinguishing this from ANY other Porter... this is the best Porter in existence in my opinion...and im sad to see it go!","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"
1501,"2002-10-20",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 24, 2003 This is one of the best beers I have had in a while. Given a blind tasting of it I would have misteken it for an imoerial stout. This is a big beer especially for a porter. Aroma is of esters, acid (hops?), and roasted malt when cold. As it warms the alcohol and chocolate really start to come out. The flavor starts somewhat sweet with highlights of malt and chocolate and coffee. It finishes bitter which feels like it could be coming from either the hops or the malts - good balance.  Another winner by the Stone Brewing dudes.","Starkville, Mississippi, USA","baobubba"

1501,"2002-10-19",3.8,"Thick, opaque, dark brown beer with a big tan head. Aroma of smoke, malt, and hops. Very smoky flavor with lots of malt, hop flavor, and bitterness. A friend commented ""This tastes like its dry-hopped with beef jerky!"" Thick, creamy, and full-bodied. As is, it tasted young with each flavor component standing a little too much on its own. Give this beer a year in the cellar to round itself out a little and it will be phenomenal.","San Francisco, California, USA","mwsf"
1501,"2002-10-17",3.8,"Very powerful porter. Taste like a powerful imperial stout. Extremely black with a high viscosity.  A high potency as well. Bitterness abounds! Slightly tangy and tart on your initial taste with loads of hops (a little too much quite honestly).Smoked grapes and mint leaves.  A hint of licorice with roasted burnt chocolate hop flavor. Lasts long on the palate.  Try with some spicy hot buffalo wings to get a balance.","Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania, USA","ARMed"
1501,"2002-10-16",5.0,"A five star for number 500. As hard as it is to believe that I have finally enjoyed my 500th different type of beer, it is harder for me to believe just how damn good this beer was. Stone does it like no other. I am a big fan of the porter style. Powerful, dark, malty,, I absolutely love it. And then they go and hop it up. A great beer for a great occasion. I also enjoyed the informative, inspirational and slightly amusing story on the back of the bottle.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
1501,"2002-10-16",4.4,"Dark, dark, dark.  Rostiness and smoke really come through in the aroma.  Nice roasted flavor in the body which finishes with a touch of smoke.  Finishes dry...  As far from a traditional porter as you can get.  I LIKE IT!!!","Acworth, Georgia, USA","belgianhomebrew"
1501,"2002-10-15",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2003 Pours with unimpressive foam retention atop a deep ruby color.  It is insanely difficult getting past this massively hopped aroma.  Cola, round hops that boast raspberry, soft breadiness, slightly phenolic, yeast, tangerine dipped chocolate, maple, wet socks, chock full of pineapple, and only an underlying hint of espresso.  Notably complex flavors of orange rind, medicine, tar, chocolate truffle, and a whisper of mocha.  Finishes extremely saltly bitter and slightly chalky with lingering tangerine and grapefruit.  Medium body with a quality velvety feel.  Afternotes of almonds, hint of peated malt, assorted tropical fruit, and charcoal.  Aged in oak?  Not long enough.  What in the world do I rate this?  An IPA/Imperial Porter hybrid?  It is over the top and tastes good; that is all that matters, right?","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1501,"2002-10-06",3.8,"VERY hoppy. The most hop-infused porter Ive had. The label, as is the case with most Stone brews, is very indicative to the beer itself: An array of seemingly confusing elements that somehow work out with sheer effective elegance. There is a noticeable malt presence, but the roasted barley I am so partial to in porters seems to a bit obscure. The alchohol is blended nicely, although there is a slight cloying of bitterness that leaves me curious as to what is hiding under that strong flavor.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"
1501,"2002-10-03",4.6,"Yes this is much different... it rolls around in my glass like slate quicksilver. Right off the bat it serves up dark roasty (dare I say <i>smokey</i>?) aromas that also offer the most pleasant and sharp grist and woody aromas Ive smelled from a beer. This started to really wake up at 53&deg;F and dripped into my tongue like chocolate cake. At 58&deg;F and fully open, there are still no detectable flaws. This is such an easy and remarkably big and robust beer. Remarkable feel -- and this from someone usually without much to say about textures. What a brewing feat! This could be my new favorite Stone beer -- Im heading to the store as soon as Im sober to stock up. This is going to be a star of late Fall and Winter.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
1501,"2002-10-03",3.9,"Black as night with a frothy mocha head. Intensely full bodied, rich chocolate malt flavor with a hint of a smokey-coffee flavor. A bitter (hop) aftertaste. My favorite porter to date.","San Diego (Mira Mesa), California, USA","papajohn"
1501,"2002-10-03",3.9,"Black but not opaque. Nice tan head laces nicely. This one isnt as smokey as their smoked porter (a good thing) but it is still noticeably smoky. Dark malts (predominately chocolate) are dominated by the citrus peel hops a bit. Not too overbalanced though.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
1501,"2002-10-01",3.4,"UPDATED: JUN 22, 2004 Not my favorite but impressive all the same. Maybe I'm not into the smoked porters,... don't know , this is the first one I've tried. Black as night and intensely full bodied.  It hides the abv well. Smells awfully smoky. Taste is not that much to my liking but I can see how it would be to some and did enjoy trying it. In Stone tradition, an intense beer!

re-rate 6/22/04: Still fairly carbonated. Pours very thick litely black (Does not pass the flashlight test) with a lite brown head. Great lacing. Aroma of very ripe plums, raisins, anise and smoke. Almost no hoppiness left in this one. Very smooth but slightly watery now. WAY too much sweetness now. The smokiness is more in check but I like the regular smoked Porter a lot better. I've got a couple more bottles laying down that I will try in following years.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"
1501,"2002-09-22",4.6,"Dark black color, medium off white head. A BIG full-bodied porter, almost chewy. Roasted malts, chocolaty. Big chewy hoppiness. WOW whatta porter. Stone is usually over the top with their beers (this is NOT a bad thing) and this beer is no exception. Big and bold flavor with a very pronounced hop bite, yet it has a very smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. No alcohol bite, despite an 8.1% ABV. Etched beer bottle.

I didn't let this puppy cool down much after the ride home in my briefcase, yet, I just can't get as much roastiness as I would want, as much fundamental porterness, through the hops. I like hops as much as the next guy, but you can't get the rest of the beer too well compared to Bear Rep. Black Stout, for example, where it is highly hopped but still super stoutlike. Am I making sense?","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

Very smooth (even more so as it warms), lots of roast on palate, coffee, cascades beat you up a bit and stay with you for a while, they finish the beer beautifully. Medium bodied.  A rich, malty mfin , roasty as hell brew with an above average hop kick with a drying finish is the best way to describe this badboy.

Looks beautiful in a big tall pint mug, perfect amount of carbonations, and a taste that combines lots of roasted grains, dark malt, and finishes with a generous amount of hops.  If I could make a plea to Stone, it would be to make this Arrogant Porter year round.  Then I would ask them to fund a charitable organization to further R&D in the area of training ""Monkey Butlers.""  If we all pitch in, this dream could someday become a reality.

Porters are my fav. and let me tell ya this is a great one. Especially if ya also love IPAs which i do. This stuff is definately hopped up and it shows through in the aroma. Nice Dark colors. And at 8.0% the alcohol is a nice warm sensation and not kickin ya in the taste buds.

1501,"2002-08-12",4.1,"Theres a hint of roasted sweetness with a distinct hoppy aroma. This pours with
a beautiful light-beige frothy head, brimming with slightly laced edges. It kind
of sticks to the sides like a shake. Mysterious and deep dark brown, you really
have to look pretty hard to peer through the edges to see anything through this
one. Big taste, but not too overpowering. I keep thinking of bittersweet chocolate
with a hint of orange overtones. Quite a good linger. It fades long, but doesnt
coat your mouth. This definitely steps up to the plate for the category of hopped-up
porters, which I heartily recommend; but be forewarned, if you dont enjoy porters
with a lean toward the flowers, you may want to stay away, or maybe let it age
a while. I will gladly take it off your hands and dispose of it properly.","San Diego, California, USA","SpaceMonkey"
