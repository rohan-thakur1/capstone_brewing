1310,"2016-03-24",3.9,"750 ml bottle into snifter; 2015 vintage bottling, bottle #01428. Pours very dark brown/black color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, licorice, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, brown bread, nuttiness, chocolate, leather, tobacco, light peat smoke/char, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and moderate fruity yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, licorice, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, brown bread, nuttiness, chocolate, leather, tobacco, light peat smoke/char, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/roast bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, licorice, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, brown bread, nuttiness, chocolate, leather, tobacco, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and moderate fruity yeast flavors; with a good malt/bitter/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light dryness from roast bitterness/oak spiciness as well. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/silky, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is a very nice barrel aged wee heavy style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and moderate fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth and easy to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
1310,"2016-03-23",4.2,"On tap at the Earth Eagle. This baby was already a big, boozy beast before it underwent the barrel aging, and the end result is one slick, sticky, sweet, bourbon-ey treat.

1310,"2015-09-06",3.7,"Thin head of light brown bubbles. Rich malty aroma with lots of dark berries (blackberry), molasses, candi sugar, vanilla and butterscotch. Very complex aroma but is missing some of the smoke and peat of a good scotch ale. Color is a very dark brown. Hmmmm, interesting flavor. A bit of sourness has crept in there which I am sure was not intended. I very much like it as it makes the mouth salivate for more and makes the brew very easy going down. More dark fruit (cherries now), butterscotch, brown sugar and dark molasses. Again missing the earthy and smokey overtones. Mild alcohol presence which I would have expected more of for a 10% brew. Finishes malty with a bit of sourness and tartness. Not what I expected or was hoping for and I am sure not what they had intended but still a very tasty brew and one that I am very much enjoying.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

I am not even sure if I could name all the esters I am getting but heres my best shot. Dark roasted chocolate, dark malts, butterscotch, toffee, dark fruit like fig, tart cherries and red grapes, earthy peat-like qualities. black licorice, and vague clove. Bold and full body. The chocolate, butterscotch and other sweet malt characters kick in at first followed almost immediately by a tart red grape and wine-like dry finish. ""An unlimited shelf life"" Shipyard boasts.

1310,"2013-10-12",3.4,"750ml C&C bottle for my bday from bro dawg pineypower, thanks Dean. Poured a super deep dark brown with a small to possibly average sized creamy beige head. Aroma on this is just odd. The bourbon does not really compliment the maltyness of the Scotch ale. Notes of earth, and pete are overtaken by bourbon and vanilla along with raisin and clove plus some honey and dates. Body is medium at best with some average carbonation and no real heat but perhaps a hint of ABV. Flavor is much like the aroam where the bourbon just fights the malts and it doenst come out well. The earthy malts now have a sweetness from the bourbon that simply leaves an odd taste overall. Notes of bourbon, earth, wet wood, cloves, rottiing raisins, dates, figs, vanilla and wet burnt toast.

1310,"2013-07-27",3.9,"Pours dark brown and fairly clear. Right about the color of slightly weak black coffee. Small khaki head, which fades pretty quickly. Only a ring and a swirl of bubbles is left behind. The aroma is sweet, toasty malt and sweet bourbon. Lots of vanilla and gooey caramel. Theres some nuttiness and light stone fruit to the beer. Maybe, a mild vinous character. Pecans, apricots, treacle, raisins. The taste is sweet with more of the same. Lots of fruit, oak, toasted, nutty malt, vanilla-heavy bourbon and creamy sweetness. The barrel character actually helps pull down the sweetness by the finish, and the beer never gets cloying. The aftertaste is lightly bitter with lots of oak, bourbon and that fruity, nutty malt flavor without the sugariness. Lots of complexity. The fruit and lightly tannic oak combine particularly nicely. The mouthfeel is full and a touch of slick. I think this beer would be truly great if they managed to turn up the chewiness. The flavors just need a somewhat thicker body to really shine. Still, its not a huge complaint. This is probably the best Shipyard beer that Ive tried. Its got a lot of good flavor, manages the bourbon barrel well and is much more drinkable than expected. Very nice work from Shipyard.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
