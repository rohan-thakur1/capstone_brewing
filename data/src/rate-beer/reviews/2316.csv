2316,"2017-05-07",4.0,"A 800. tesztelt sörként erre az italra esett a választásom - némi brandy és az érlelés jelenléte úgy általában igen nagy csalogató erővel bír, a nemes feladat beteljesítésére tökéletes alanynak látszott tehát a főzet. Ezt a meggyőződésemet így utólag sem változtatnám számottevően, minden rendben ment, kellemes benyomásokat hagyott hátra maga után, talán csak arról van szó, hogy minél sötétebb és testesebb egy sör, annál nagyobb eséllyel pályázik kivívni a szimpátiámat. Ebben az esetben azonban nyilvánvalóan szemléletmódot váltottam, így az aranyszínű test tökéletesség-közeli külleme sem kerülte el a figyelmemet. Vibrálóan élénk aromái, melyek a hófehér hab dús rétegei alól bukkannak fel, éretlen zöldalmás, ecetes, almaboros szövevényt alkotva adják a fanyar, üde, spontán erjesztésű ízvilág ígéretét, nem törődve azzal, hogy éppen egy belgian strong ale-t kóstolgatunk. Nem is váratnak sokáig magukra a citromos színezetű, cideres, száraz fehérborok almás kicsengésű legjavát hordozó jegyei, amelyek igen intenzíven, ellentmondást nem tűrően vésik be névjegyüket a kompozícióba. Ki-ki eldöntheti aztán, hogy mennyire belgian strong ale, s mennyire sour ale-szerű a szerkezet, majd kissé materiálisabb irány felé haladva az is megállapodás tárgyát képezheti, hogy mennyire tűnik kimagasló értékűnek a főzet az árához viszonyítva, összességében azonban semmi nem hagy kétséget afelől, hogy a különleges sörök között megérdemelt helye van, így tehát méltó alanyaként szolgálhatott egy kisebbfajta mérföldkő megünnepléséhez.","HUNGARY","adster"

2316,"2017-03-30",3.8,"On tap at Owen's Ordinary in North Bethesda, MD. 

Slightly hazy yellow with a fine, off-white head and excellent lacing. 

Aroma of apple jack, white grapes, yeast, candi sugar, brett, oak and banana. 

Taste of sweet white grapes, candi sugar, yeast, sweet apple juice, sour apples, wood, sweet peaches and banana. This very sweet and fruity yet with a slightly sour element, too. 

Full/medium body and low carbonation. 

Great aroma, which initially reminds me of opening a cask of aged apple jack, but then gets more complex--and much sweeter. The flavor continues the complexity, but also the extreme sweetness. I had a 4 ounce pour as a dessert beer, which was perfect. For other purposes, this may be too sweet.

2316,"2016-07-28",3.8,"Apparence : Dorée, moyennement opaque, beau col blanc à la rétention acceptable, effervescence moyenne et modérément rapide, belle dentelle.

On a à lorigine une bière très levurée, phénolique et on se retrouve avec un liquide fruité, rustique et légèrement acide, tout en présentant un corps plus atténué certainement dû aux brettanomyces.

Beaucoup de fruité en bouche également, pêche, pomme verte, raisin vert, citron Le houblon (floral et résineux) et lalcool ne sont que subtilement perceptible derrière cette acidité dominante, lamertume est minimale. Très bonne bière, goût intéressant, très intense, bonne complexité en bouche, mais je préfère tout de même la Buteuse régulière, je trouve ce brassin spécial un peu trop acide.","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","pumpkinhead2"

Au rythme de la musique créée par le crépitement des bulles éclatant à la surface de ce collet-monté, de douces et chaudes effluves dalcool, de feuilles mortes, de bois pourri et de pommes envahissent à la fois lappareil olfactif et gustatif tellement les arômes sont complexes.

La bouche est un peu surprise de son goût. Les bretts prennent ici toute la place. Un côté acidulé reste longtemps sur certaines parties de la langue, tandis que lalcool camoufle trop certaines particularités, ce qui les rend difficilement identifiables. 

En faisant la lecture du descriptif sur létiquette, on se demande sils nont pas abusé dimagination pour la vendre, à un prix exorbitant, soit dit en passant. Cela peut-être simplement une question de perception, mais il ny aucune trace de vanille, quelque chose paraît épicé, mais cest vague. Lhistoire du tabac frais, cest tiré par le chveux.

2316,"2011-12-02",3.4,"750ml bottle...cant believe I have to travel to Calgary to get this but such is life - at least I got to try it. That being said I didnt actually know what the expect and the lacto/tartness that was quite ripe completely threw me off - then I found out it had brett and things began to make sense. Amber with an off white head. Grains, brett, alcohol and apples (brandy), a cutting sweetness that I cant quite identify but similar to a chardonnay and oak. Combination of lacto, tart and sweetness on the palate - very unbalanced to begin with but once it had 30 minutes to breath things began to meld much better - carbonation was a bit high in my opinion, full bodied. Very very dry finish, some spice, tart and brandy. An interesting beer - not quite sure how I feel about it - would like to have another bottle to sit on fir a bit and see how it does with another 6 months.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"

Aroma of alcohol, tangy fruit - persimmon, nice and sour (good sour) - with oak (not bourbon, I guess its brandy) - somewhat vinous, but more white wine than red - 8+.  Taste is big oak with the tart fruit and brandy, but with dry nuttiness and a building wild yeast character, even champagne like - really, REALLY loved the dry nuttiness jutaposed against the barrel and Orval-y character, splendid stuff!  Frothy mouthfeel, just average-bodied, solid but soft carbonation (doesnt sting at all) - very light and airy, hides the alcohol very well, leaves a lightly acidic fruity and dry aftertaste - crazily easy to drink, I will grab another if I see one in Québec, hang the cost!!","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

Some components are individually nice, but together just doesnt work for me...As little as the aroma worked, taste was even less successful. Alex kept saying perfume and thats dead on.

Poured out a hazy amber with an off white large foamy crown that gets knocked down to a ring. Smells like a fruitier version of Orval. Lots of citrus and some tropical fruits. Orange, lemon both on the sour side, bread crumbs, light funk and must. Apple pie apples without the spices. Pretty decent soft aroma that pleases the senses. Wonderful taste that keeps me coming back for more without being blown away at a single point. The fact that dudes in T.O. dolled out $46 bottle at Volo pretty much makes me sick - you guys got rick rolled! Just looking at the beard on that creep on the label should have made you think twice. 46$. Ouch. With all that said, this is still a very yumm-o brew. Brett, medium unassuming spices that creep into the secret places under your tongue that happify your taste buds. Now that Im paying attention (hard to think that after pounding most of this back without thought) there is a LOT going on here. Apples and sourness and then light funk and then a must that gets more funky then a loaf of bread passes by quickly then dulling spices and a long tart finish straightened me right the hell out. I just realized that this is 10%.... good bye tomorrows productivity.... again. The smell has changed to something spectacular. It took this long? Ill take it. Bump to 8 with ease. The spice and occasional thickness greeted me with open arms. Dammmit. Now I love this? ack. I was disappointed before. Mediocrity has morphed into acute interest. Then I hit a handful of sips that fade into the night without notice.

On first sniff, this is clearly fermented with Brett- clear sour notes of barnyard, acidic lemon, and funk that really dominate the front of the nose. As I continue to delve into the aroma, the funk falls away, leaving a foundation built from notes of green apple, cider, plum, orange liqueur like Grand Marnier, some doughy yeast, booze, and touches of sage-- incredibly complex and impressive. Flavor is luscious, with charred wood and a wetter manifestation of Brett like musty hay. The hop, brandy alcohol, and fruit seems to build as the flavor progresses. Mouthfeel is full bodied, with characteristics from both the sour brett and sweet and boozy Belgian notes creating an amazingly diverse but symbiotic palate.

Dry, medium bodied, quite carbonated MF; long fruity aftertaste gaining a perfumed rosewater-like flavour. Very special beer; IMO more like a (Belgian) sour ale than a Strong Belgian.

Taste is also a quite complex mix between some funky ester with dominant barnyard notes and a typical Belgium tripel malt base with balanced sweetness. Body is above average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol.

2316,"2010-02-01",3.9,"750ml bottle.  The body is clear, showing an orange-gold amber hue.  A small, foamy, ivory colored head breaks apart at the middle, forming a smooth, fat ring around the edge of the surface.  Sudsy lacing primarily rejoins the body below.  Scents of rightfully oxidized, residual candy sugar malts and dried red apples provide an earthy, subdued sweetness, while hints of tart fruit merge with woody brett and vanilla barrel notes to form the aromatic counterpoint.   Flavors mirror the nose, striking complimentary balance between the tempered sweetness of the dried out caramel and candied apples, and the musky, bretty, vanilla kissed oak.  The body sports a wild, dusty, drying body that is medium-plus in substance, with a soft, persistent carbonation.  This is an excellent ""wild"" Belgian strong ale.  Id love to try the base beer for contrast, just to see how buggy the barrel aging process was.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

2316,"2009-02-15",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2017 My Bottom Line:
An intricate equilibrium of apple/apricot jam, coniferous wilderness, honeyed, toasted malts and wooden alcohol dryness blooms into a bouquet of flowers the likes of which one would love to admire more often.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A layer of foam clings to the top of the cloudy honeyed gold.
-Carbonation is frothy and prickly throughout, able to alleviate the bulky mouthfeel.
-The perfume on this one is extremely complex, perhaps more so than the flavor profile. Maybe because this aroma is more delicate?
-The floral character is reminiscent of roses and lavender.
-Orange zest can be perceived in this apple and apricot jam fruitiness.
-Light hop bitterness is found with the alcohol and oak in the finish.
-Both brettanomyces and wooden barrel are expertly balanced with the rest of the beer. Both can be tasted, but neither takes total control, which I love.
-I split the bottle three ways and had it at different temperatures over a few hours. Result: even though the beautiful aroma was more proficient at warmer temperatures (12 to 14 degrees Celsius), I was actually surprised to find out that the cooler glass (5-7 degrees) felt the most cohesive overall flavor-wise. Next time I have a bottle, Ill drink it cooler than cellar temp.
