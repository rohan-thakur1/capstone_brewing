2386,"2017-02-22",3.4,"Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a sturdy red color with a fingers worth of sly white foamy head. Stringy lace.
The aroma started off with some roasted malty nuts. Some toffee/caramel sort of cleanliness hits some bitter citrus to piney hops.
The flavor takes the malts and leans them up against the bitter hops, somewhat there and somewhat not. Crisp sort of roasty malts and hop burn in the aftertaste and that hits the finish somewhat dryly.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Mild carbonation. ABV felt appropriate.
Overall, even with the hop burn in the aftertaste and finish, I like this one. Seems like mostly everything fits, but also perhaps an amber ale that some may need to get used to.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Rich, foamy head atop a brown ale body, darker than amber, I think. Taste is indeed big on malts. Hops are there as a kind of sting to one part of the tongue. There may be some oxidation going on.

2386,"2014-02-22",3.8,"This says its a ""cross between an ale and a sensory eruption"" on the label, which for some reason strikes me as one of the more ridiculous things Ive seen in print today. Sensory eruption? Like is my tongue going to split and spew out hot lava? Is Edward Van Halen going to march across my hallowed palate playing a crudely painted guitar? Maybe I am making too much out of this but it just strikes me as a bit much. This all being said, this is a very nice IPA-ish amber colored beer. There is a focus on hops in the nose and its plenty bitter but the brewers left quite a lot of room for toasty malt character to express itself. This makes for a full flavored beer w/ a strong malty flavor w/o being sweet or heavy at all. The carbonation is subdued and creamy which fits the flavor profile well too. Overall, while I am not certain I have felt Edward Van Halen himself prancing in my mouth, this is a very tasty beer and one I am very glad to have tried. Just change the copy on the bottle.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Still a hop forward beer, the finish is long with bitterness at the front but sweet at the end. Complex in its simplicity, ( it's hoppy but the malt is so well balanced that it keeps it from being the dominate characteristic) this is an amber to try at least once.

2386,"2011-04-21",2.1,"Bottle courtesy of BeerFMAndy. Served in a Cantillon tulip.

Pour yields a brew with a slightly-reddened light copper body with a half-finger off-white head that is quite bubbly. The bubbles pop and the head fades down quite quickly. Thin collar with quite a few bubbles around the edges. The nose brings a bit of amber malt with some mild earthy tones and a bit of sweetness. Bread tones around the edges. A bit of grain husk as I continue to swirl this one. 

The flavor is a bit grainy and slightly metallic. Certainly too many tannins in this one. The husk presence really comes through and is not terribly enjoyable, detracting from the underlying amber malt and breadiness. The finish is harsh and bitter. Unfortunately, something went seriously wrong in the process of this one.

I like a Fat Tire, even if its not the greatest. This came off sub-par somewhere in comparison. Reminded me of a cross between Lucky Kat & Roxy Rolles, as they were fresh in memory. So-so in my book.

The nose is surprisingly hoppy for an Amber, but the hops have a distinct metallic quality to them.  A fair amount of toasted malt shows through as well. Balanced flavor between the hops and malt, with neither really impressing me.  The hops are fairly muted with a moderate level of bitterness and some citrus rind on the finish.  The malts are toasty and a little husky with a sweetness that emerges on the back end.  Pretty full bodied and hearty for the style, with a nice soft fizzy carbonation level.

The aroma is a combination of light citrus hops, with oranges and pineapple, and a light caramel malt sweetness.  Its kinda got a musty character to it, with some earthy hops as it warms.

2386,"2007-08-20",3.8,"This beer wasnt what I expected, and Im not sure its ""true to style,"" but I thought it was delicious.

A very pleasant ruby red-amber color with a relatively brilliant finish, but a limited amount of carbonation, from the look of it.  Aroma is what I think an amber ale should be - a nice blend of caramel and hoppiness bound together so thoroughly you cant really tell where one ends and the other begins.  Flavor is pronounced hoppiness...not really true to  style (IMO) but delicious nonetheless.  Mouthfeel is a bit sticky, like a pretty good IPA.  I like this beer quite a bit.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

2386,"2007-05-31",3.9,"5/31/2007:  Ambergeddon pours a golden-amber color with an adequate dense, foamy head that is off-white in color and does a good job and sticking around for awhile (it also provides some nice web-like lacing from top to bottom!).  A nice, juicy citrus and light pine hoppiness bursts out of the aroma and is noticeable as soon as the cap is popped off.  The flavor reveals pine hops, some soft citrus (sweet grapefruit) hops, and the perfect amount and intensity of caramel maltiness to balance it out.  The hop flavors are very nice as is the unique (or at least less common) movement from hop flavor and bitterness to maltiness rather than the reverse (malt, then hops and bitterness).  This beer is very well put together.  The bitterness is really quite mild and smooth and trails off nicely through the finish and then lingers a bit in the throat.  Even the dry, floral finish seems to be at just the right level.  Also, if there really is nearly 7% ABV in there, then it is completely invisible!  The body of the beer is medium-full and so soft and smooth with an ever so slight creamy texture.  Very nice.  Completely under-rated...  I would call this more of a PALE ale with and AMBER color, but symantics aside, this is a GOOD beer!  I definitely need to get my hands on more of this!  Totally sessionable with each taste revealing a new subtle quality every time.  I think this might have just supplanted Terrapin Rye Pale Ale as one of my top session beers!  Sorry Sean!

2386,"2007-05-30",1.0,"This is an overrated beer.  Usual (for the brewery) stinky cheese aroma that is very off-putting, taste is west coast flavor, without the quality. All hop, no malt.

Ambergeddon pours a slightly chill hazed caramel into my pint glass. A 1 finger dense craggy head formed on the pour that stuck around awhile. As the head slowly fades it becomes thick and creamy. Leaves strong lacing.

Aroma begins with a mild caramel background but big juicy citric hops kick any malt thats there out of the way quickly. The hop combination is pretty unique. Theres the usual grapefruit along with a squeeze of lemon but those two are more in the background. The main citric hop character is lime. Mild pine needles waft through the air as well.

Grapefruit hops come through up front. Theres always that little hint of caramel maltiness in the background but hops rule the roost. The grapefruit in the flavor is sweetened and juicy along with some lip puckering qualities. Couple sprinklings of lemon juice on top of pine needles on the swallow. Very enjoyable.

Medium body with a smooth and lush mouthfeel. Finishes with a solid dryness that helps accentuate the hops. Solid bitterness.

Easy drinking enjoyable beer. The dryness leaves you wanting another drink right after the last.

My first beer from Ale Asylum and hopefully not my last. Im a sucker for hoppy reds and this hits the nail on the head. Excellent.

2386,"2007-04-22",3.5,"Amber color with a taller canvas colored head. For as big as the bubbles are the head is quite lasting.  Better than average amber aromas, as this one has a hops presence. Mildly toasted malt seems to have a backstage to the full hops nose. Mild pine and citrus abound in this amber. As the bottle states a west coast amber, and I would have to agree. Very lightly toasted malt in the flavor as well along with plenty of citrus peels and light pine pitch. Very dry in the finish. The hops seem a bit green at times, but still a nice amber.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

Sweet hop sincerity suckles with honey amaretto toffee, cherry spruce and a dried mango rind in the summer sun. Flavor parleys with amaretto toffee and a touch of rubbing alcohol for offshoot cleanliness. Mulberries get stuck on the brittle British toffee for a husky - floral - praline sweet combination treat. Spruce needles get dipped in diluted crème brulee with Disaronno for an alcohol flavored accent. Medium-bodied and clean, with a few piney and pinging carbonation characteristics that never seem able to quite work things out.

The final sample of the night and the second best beer I tried.  Although it   gets a higher rating than the Diablo, the Diablo is a style that I prefer more.   Give it a try if you make to the brewery - this is not your average amber ale.

Aroma / Apperance - A ruby colored body with a thin foamy head.  The hops   were definitely west coast with a smooth caramel and grapefruit aroma.  Buttery   hints played with the pine resin to invite me to take a sip.

Flavor / Palate - The first impression was slightly bitter spruce with   Vegemite smeared toast.  Soon it becomes a nice balance of grapefruit, pine,   caramel and malt.  The mouthfeel is packed with flavor that does not overwhelm   despite the huge array of flavors presenting themselves to the palate.  This   was the second best sample of the night; the Ale Asylum has certainly not   mailed in their amber ale.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
