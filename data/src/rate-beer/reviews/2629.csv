2629,"2012-09-03",3.5,"On draft at the source. The beer is light yellow with a thin white head. The aroma offers a bit of banana and spice. A bit weak. The flavor is better than the aroma, with banana and clove character more present. Light in body with solid carbonation. One of the better offerings from Flat Branch.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

2629,"2011-05-16",2.7,"It poured a reddish color. The aroma was malts and spices. The flavor was weak hops and spice. An ok Weizen.","Wentzville, Missouri, USA","jandd1983"
2629,"2010-07-24",2.8,"Pour is a clear gold with a large white head.  Aroma is a little clove and spice with breadyness.  Flavor is a dull wheat and none of the cloves show up in the flavor.  Kinda finishes dry but uneventful.  My samples of this style are few and far between so i would not even know of this is close to being spot on for the style.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
2629,"2009-06-21",3.4,"The pour is mostly clear with a nich white cap. Theres an odd sour/tang in the nose. Theres some clove, but the odd character detracts. The flavor is much better though. Bavarian yeast character balanced with herbal hops and a crisp, refreshing finish.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
2629,"2009-06-14",2.5,"PIlsner-ish offering. Almost tasteless except for a lingering carbonated staleness. Weak all around.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
2629,"2009-05-27",4.0,"Sampler @ brewpub. Comes to me with a completely clear, dark straw color.  The carbonation is visible and strong.  Has a thick head that leaves a lightly sticky lacing. It looks very nice, I am surprised I could find beauty in a filtered beer but this works. Aroma is surprisingly a thick white bread maltiness with some lemon and herbal hops.  Definitely comes off as a filtered hefe but it actually works great.  The esters are so reduced that these other aspects shine, especially since they are so vibrant and clean.  Taste is similar where the lemon aspects are stronger.  A beautiful execution of a clean wheat beer.  It is easy drinking and fun, I never thought I would say that about a Kristal Weizen.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
2629,"2009-03-13",3.0,"Tap at the restaurant. Kind of a hazy reddish pour. No head. Aroma is malts and spices. Flavor is some weak hops and spice. An ok beer. Very medium to light body. No real aftertaste.","Jefferson City, Missouri, USA","dwaggs2"
2629,"2008-07-31",2.9,"The beer is very clear, and slightly hazy from being served too cold.  Has alight spice nose, with almost no flavor on the palate, very light wheaty notes, but lacks body and is slightly watery in the finish.  Disappointing.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"
2629,"2006-06-25",3.7,"A little bit weak, but tastey.  Hop in the front and an almosty malty flavor at end.  Very mild, but very good. Quite a smooth palate.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","KUEric"
