1750,"2007-10-23",3.4,"In short: Superior Vienna.  Smooth, round and very pleasant lager.
How: Tap (many times) at brewpub
The look: Clear amber body with a long-lasting small off-white head
In long: Soft, bready, round and smooth.  Limited sweetness and timid aromatic hops leaves a lot of room for the lager yeast.  The chewy malt brings a flavour of caramel with the sweetness removed (if such a thing even exists).  Some wet grass.  A good beer although it is below par considering the rest of lineup of this excellent brewpub.  These guys are undoubtedly the masters of czech lagers and this Vienna is pretty much as good as they get but the Vienna style is rather constraining.  I mean, theres only so much Van Gogh could do with a Home Depot paint roller and a bucket of white paint.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1750,"2007-10-21",3.8,"Have had this one quite a few times, most recently on 9/28/07 at the brewery.Dark for a vienna, with more a light brown colored body than the typical auburn or tan.  Medium-sized beige head is well-retained, with light lacing left behind.  High clarity.Sweet munich and pale malts in the nose certainly give a full, malty aroma, as a good German lager should.  Chocolate malt gives mostly color, but theres a hint of light roast and dark chocolate, before the finish is transformed by the yeast and juicy, grassy hops.  Authentic lager yeast crispness surfaces through the sweet malts and the fresh character of the yeast is endearing as well.  Medium to medium-high strength of aroma, no flaws.Quite sweet up front, but with a light breadiness from the munich malt lengthening the flavor and providing good transition in to the more dry, hopped and crisp finish.  Some very sweet pale malt and light chocolate sticks to the back of the palate, and overall, this batch could be probably a bit more dry.  But I applaud the relative lack of breadiness.  Not as fruity as some viennas Ive had, but just as supple and well-malted as the best German examples.  Soft, grassy/floral hops with low bitterness.  Fantastic stuff as usual from Lamere a boire.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

A very small head tops the clear dark copper-amber body....nose is full of caramel, with grassy-herbal qualities fighting for dominance early on, but eventually losing to the luscious malts....on the tongue, a beautiful creamy mouthfeel holds spaces for herbal and lightly acidic characteristics, lots of caramel again, faint nuttiness....very pleasant if not earthshaking example of another Euro lager style that is the forte of this great brewpub.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
