2939,"2017-01-16",3.8,"Brouwers, Seattle. Bottle pour shared with SinH4 for his 3600th. Cloudy, yeasty cider appearance. Dry body. Light tannic. Champagne yeasty nose. Light tart. Nice but not exceptional. (Quick notes after RB ate my original rate!)","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
2939,"2017-01-14",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2017 Tap, rating #3600. Hazy orange color with no head. Aroma is red apples, yeast, some vanilla. Taste is red apples, ""mehlig"", with a tart bite and a nice amount of tannins. Bone dry finish. Nice cider, but the tannins are a bit too much like having flour in your mouth. Still very good, but not totally for me.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"
2939,"2015-10-01",5.0,"Love this cider! Complex, rustic cider. Great body, tannic mouthfeel, the aroma is amazing. Big fan of Alpenfire!","","Craftbrewhaha"
2939,"2015-08-30",4.0,"Bottle sampled at Alpenfire, pours a hazy golden blonde with a tiny white head. Aroma brings out light funk, some champagne yeast, and medium dry apples. Flavour is very dry and funky, with lots of barnyard funk, light champagne yeast, puckering dryness that dries the mouth, and a touch of residual sweetness. Brilliantly crafted, with high complexity. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2939,"2015-08-28",3.6,"Bottle - Light grass and Apple.  Clear gold.  Earthy, not sweet and a long earthy almost manure finish.  Nice.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2939,"2014-12-11",4.2,"another great Alpenfire cider. such great earthy, vaguely fruity characters without being appley. tannin on this one is significant, and mostly astringent with light bitterness. Acid is medium low, as is sweetness; for once Im actually wishing for slightly more sweetness. Beautiful American take on French cider, without high sweetness, with a bit more alcohol, and without too much fizz. Highly recommended for cider lovers.","Kansas, USA","udubdawg"
2939,"2014-12-02",3.6,"Bottle from Total Wine.

Straw-yellow pour with a little bit of sediment toward the bottom of the bottle. Somewhat musty aroma. Flavor is on the dry side but with enough sweetness to keep it easy-drinking. Just a touch of funk, a fair dose of tannins. Well made cider.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2939,"2014-11-15",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2015 Bottle. Cloudy but otherwise typical cider pour. Aroma is apple and bitter apple skins, lemon and funk. Flavor leans to the dry side, but not overdone, and remains relatively complex and interesting. Background note of hay, lemon, peach and barnyard funk about it. Kind of thin in the finish. Really balanced, solid, interesting, and refined. I like this a lot.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"
2939,"2014-05-22",3.5,"Bottle at Capitol Cider, SeattlePale yellow color. Nice aroma of apple skins, almost smokey. The mouthfeel is quite dry, but also soft; nice apple flavor, and pleasant light astringency in the final.Good cider, similar to the French ciders, more character than the usual American ciders.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
2939,"2013-09-16",3.2,"Bottle beautiful pink gold color, champagne head. Soft apple aroma. Taste is bitter apples, medium dry finish. Light body.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
2939,"2013-04-24",4.1,"Bottle at beveridge place. Incredible complexity and depth for a crazy dry cider. Refreshing and went well with the food we had (Greek).","Seattle, Washington, USA","mages64"
2939,"2013-02-21",4.0,"A cool cider to sit on for a bit. Effervescent and lively, my pour brought out the best of apples without the artificial flavor I get from Angry Orchard.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Lazerlobe"
2939,"2012-05-08",2.9,"A very lively yellow cider. A little funky horse blanket nose. tastes like wood. Like apple stems.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Alphadelic"
2939,"2010-09-05",3.8,"750, capped. Pours a clear bright pale gold with no head, lace, or legs. Totally still, but has a glitter to it. Big rich red apple and mild apple skin nose. Sugary but not at all overbearing. Creamy medium body, not quite crisp and light. Definitely has some residual heft from the fruit syrup. Plenty of rich apple flavor, a bit sweet but not as sweet as plenty of eating apples can be. Clean clear red apple flavor right through to the finish. Yummy stuff.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2939,"2010-07-16",3.6,"Crisp end notes after a strong apple body, rounded out with a mild sweetness.","Portland, Oregon, USA","stchloe"
