1997,"2017-02-20",3.9,"Bottle shared in London / thanks to Fergus. Pours reddish brown with a foamy, khaki head. Rush coffee aroma, some milk chocolate, soft roast. Medium sweet flavour with some milk chocolate, coffee ice cream, mellow earthy bitterness, accents if dried berries. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Well balanced finish, with more hearty coffee, some more ice cream, vanilla cream, mild bitterness, just a little boozy warmth. Great stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

More deadened nose, gorgeous pour, good flavors, flow, touch ofcsticky and toasty malt, touch of body, firm adjuncts and sweeter flavors meld and sustain well. Tasty stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
1997,"2017-01-01",3.2,"Malty aroma with a hint of coffee and cocoa. Pours almost black. Nice treacley taste with coffee and chocolate joining the party. First few mouthful left a bitter aftertaste, almost like stale coffee, but seems to be improving as I drink a little more, perhaps because it is warming a tiny bit, or losing its fizz slightly. Think this would be good as a nitro to smooth out the bitterness. (K)","","batneil"
1997,"2016-12-29",3.5,"Dark brown color. Tons of coffee and cocoa, very malty nose. Vanilla and coffee are super strong but too cold right now. Very malty lots of caramel, but too sweet and a bit cloying. Not bad","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"

1997,"2016-11-03",3.8,"Bottle from BevMo! in Redwood City, CA. Aroma is mild coffee, chocolate, vanilla. Taste is more vanilla and chocolate than coffee. Really smooth but a little underwhelming especially consider this is from Modern Times AND Drakes Electric Owl is on another level compared to this.","Redwood City, California, USA","tightslice"
1997,"2016-11-03",3.7,"22 ounce bottle purchased at The Davis Beer Shoppe. The aroma on this has sweet chocolate notes with a little underlying roast and minimal coffee. Beneath that is a little husky malt character. Pretty nice. Transparent cola-colored body with a small to medium light tan head. Starts with some fairly sweet chocolate flavors, before this has a little roasted coffee in the middle. Finishes with some nuttiness and almost a dry, papery mouthfeel. Light astringency late. This is pretty good, as far as brown ales go. They dressed it up pretty well.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
1997,"2016-10-27",4.7,"Big aromas of coal and coffee. Deep thick mahogany block most light. Thin but lasting light head. Super smooth brown coco to coffee transition that vanilla slides in on and adds to as they all fade together. Has the body of a cup of coffee.","truckee, California, USA","krumbum"
1997,"2016-10-20",3.9,"Type: 22-oz. bottle
Glass: Clear 14.75-oz. porter/stout glass
From: Trader Joes in La Mesa (San Diego), Calif.
Price: $6.99
Purchased: Oct. 7, 2016
Consumed: Oct. 9, 2016
Reviewed as: American Brown Ale
Misc.: Bottled on Sept. 25, 2016 (I think, it was tough to read)

Was eyeing this when I saw their release calendar, but forgot about it until I got an email from them in late September. This was pretty much right up my alley. Coffee, vanilla and cocoa nibs, and Modern Times? Had high hopes on this one.

Poured a reddish brown amber-to-light brown color with three fingers of khaki tan frothy lacing. Could see some bubbles coming up along the sides despite the dark color. Excellent-to-world-class uneven spiderweb lacing. Excellent retention. A very good looking beer. (Sight - 4.50)

Smelled a nice mix of flavors, in order getting cocoa nibs, black coffee powder, bitter dark chocolate, char wood, burnt toast, vanilla beans, roasted malts, ashtray, black licorice, wood chips, some oats and hints of Cheerios cereal. (Smell - 4.00)

Taste followed the nose nicely. Definitely another solid coffee offering from Modern Times. Got bitter black coffee, dark cocoa powder, char wood, some ashtray, burnt toast, vanilla beans, anise, black licorice, roasty malts and dark chocolate fudge. (Taste - 4.25)

Medium-to-full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, roasty, bitter finish. (Feel - 4.25)

Pretty much about as good as I expected. Just a very good coffee beer. Would love to see a BBA version of this. (Overall - 4.25)

>> Clear, deep red pour. Tremendous foam. Really nice nose of dense vanilla, grilled strawberry, toasted macadamia. Served a bit too cold, so nose really opens up after it warms. Taste has mild paper, anesthetic, weak sauce compared to the aroma. Heavy roast though, light stout like flavor. Medium light body, light coffee derived acid perhaps in the finish.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
