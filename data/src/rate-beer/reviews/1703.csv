1703,"2017-03-31",4.2,"I started my good beer passion with this beer and the belgianl/trappist beers found quite cheap in supermarkets where I live. I was first amazed then I got into the craft scene and maybe due to availability and low price I kind of snobbed it. I sometimes grabbed it again due to its low price but was always just good and not great. Now with a palate with more experience I can tell this is a masterpiece good in every aspect: appereance, amore, taste and especially palate.
A; awesome in weizen glass! 3/4 fingers of good spumy white head with big persitence, great deep golden colour with touches of amber and also light yellow on the extremites all very hazy, carbonation with many tiny bubbles raising from the glass.
A; good banana, lemon and slight lemon zest a bit clove, little mango, little spices smell.
T: sweet and a bit sour in the beginning , fruity bananish lemony developing in midpalate coupled with more slight sourness, in the end little bit of spiciness, sourness and the right amount of hops lead to a dry end. Heavily carbonated altough less than many belgian beers. Great mouthfeel too and perfect palate which develops its taste perfectly and make the beer go down fine. Amazing drinkability.

1703,"2017-01-09",4.0,"Duży sentyment do tego piwa. Od dawna trafiały do mnie niemieckie wersje. Szczególnie upodobałem sobie niedostępne w Polsce marcowe warki szykowane na Oktoberfest. Piwo drogie, dopiero od niedawna dostępne w butelkach 0,5 litra. Wcześniej w mniejszej objętości.
Piwo pszeniczne, aczkolwiek z etykiety możemy wyczytać, że użyto też słodów jęczmieniach. Piana idealna. Drobne, równe jak maszerująca niemiecka armia, pęcherzyki. Trwała towarzysząca do końca. W porównaniu do innych koncerniaków na tym polu nie ma sobie równych. Mętne, słomkowe, pszeniczne.

Zapach, niezbyt intensywny. Trzeba się sporo napracować nosem by wyczuć korzenność i delikatne nuty owocowe. Z czasem gdy piwo się ogrzewało było coraz lepiej.
Smak orzeźwiający. Pszeniczny. Delikatnie kwaskowy. Bez goryczki. Lekko i przyjemnie.
Jest coś w tym piwie, co je wyróżnia. W smaku charakterystyczne. Łatwo jest je odróżnić od innych piw pszenicznych. Trudno mi określić co, to jest. Stawiałbym na wodę, której używa się w produkcji.","POLAND","LiwkoLiwko"

En apariencia esta cerveza cuenta con un color dorado con turbiedad característica de las wissen bávaras creado por los almidones de la malta de trigo y la cuantiosa levadura que se emplea, una muy amplia corona de espuma que impide la oxidación de la cerveza, clara y cristalina con burbujas amplias, un cuerpo liviano que aunque deja marca en el vaso se percibe muy ligero. En aroma resalta el aroma a platano, bizcocho, especiado a clavo, dulzor fresco, hay una ausencia total del lúpulo y algo de cítrico. Ya en paladar es una cerveza muy ligera para dar tragos largos, el principal sabor es el de especias de la levadura que aparentan clavo y coriandro, haciéndola compleja, seguido por un fuerte sabor a trigo que es complementado con un muy agradable dulzor moderado, sabores a pan y plátano tambien muy identificables, sesionable y adecuada para épocas de calor y para el desayuno.","MEXICO","Yased"

1703,"2015-09-07",4.3,"When I first started reviewing beer way back in 2008, hefeweizen was one of the uniquely foreign styles I found myself attracted to. Seven years later, my love for authentic German brews of the style has not dissipated, and Im able to savor their flavor even more. Paulaner Hefe-Weizen was a good beer when I first had it, but drinking it today I realize how great it really is. Big on flavor and aroma and remarkably easy and fun to drink - thats a winning combination for sure.

I poured a 500ml bottle into a weizen glass. It had a best before date of 1/2016 and cost $2.79 ($0.17 per ounce).

Appearance: A deep shade of orange/light brown. Extremely hazy, but fine carbonation can always been seen rushing up to the top. Pours to a large, white, foamy head which retains and laces excellently.

Smell: Sweet banana bread scent with a touch of orange and a light clove-like spice character. 

Taste: There are those who scoff at the hefeweizen style and say they all taste essentially the same because the yeast does most of the work. While I would agree with the latter, I disagree with the former as I have had plenty that are mild and boring (and some that are just plain bad). When I think of a great-tasting hefe, this is what I think of. Up front theres strong wheat presence that imparts a bit of a tart, cracker-like character. Banana bread is also quite prominent, though it emerges much more on the finish than the beginning. Through the middle I detect a light spicy sensation; a mixture of orangepeel, clove, cinnamon and just the faintest hint of peppercorn. The aftertaste is all banana bread, though it fades rather quickly. All in all, this is how a hefeweizen should taste.

Drinkability: I can drink beers of this style year-round, though I prefer them in warmer weather. I had absolutely no trouble downing a tall glass of Paulaner Hefe-Weizen on a hot summers day. The beer is highly-carbonated for sure, but its a fine/micro carbonation. It literally vibrates across the tongue, but at the same time scrubs the palate clean. Refreshing while in the mouth, and highly quaffable even though its a perfectly medium-bodied brew at 5.5% ABV. It would be awfully tempting to session this, but the 11.2oz cans are hard to find. A single half liter is definitely sufficient. I wish Paulaner would offer this in 500ml cans or even 1-liter cans!

1703,"2014-12-17",3.6,"A classic german ""Hefeweizen"". This means that the yeast, which provides the second bottle fermentation, stays in the bottle. But other than similar belgium beers, the yeast has to go into the glass in order to be drunk with the beer. So these beers are always troubled and the yeast gives a huge part of the taste. The Paulaner surprises with a dryer hop note than most of its brothers. Tghis makes it quite unique and is very pleasant. On the other hand, the typical banana hint is much less detectable. Still, its a wonderful thirst killer.
What makes this Hefeweizen so good, is the fact that it is not the truely typical Hefeweizen. It has its own character as it slightly dryer that other Hefeweizens. Sure, if youre searching for the wonderful banana hints a Erdinger provides e.g., you might be dissapointed.

1703,"2014-10-13",4.0,"Review: Can of Paulaner Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb 5.5%ABV

Paulaners have made good beer for close to 400 years, so it was with great excitement that I had a chance to sample a Oktoberfest special and the brewerys biggest selling product. German beer is always a winner so lets see how I got on

The smell was of a very very strong sweet aroma, but lovely on the nose. The aroma is mostly wheat and earthy with some light citrus notes. Going by the smell, its already off to a great start, lovely stuff. This is a beer that means business.

On pour I got a very large frothy white head that took a little while to settle, with a dark cloudy golden colour of a beer appearing. There was very good lacing with some carbonation.


When the head finally settled down, I started on the important business of the tasting. The taste was not as overly strong as I had expected, it was extremely smooth and clean to drink, subtle flavours, with a lovely feel to it. To be honest I didnt find too much going on with the taste, as the flavours were particularly soft on the palate, with a mild wheat and yeast taste. There was a very faint but nice citrus hop aftertaste, This has to be one of the most drinkable beers I have had in a long time, was very easy to drink and enjoyable in the process. Such a shame I only bought a few cans! Can see why this beer is so popular in the beer halls of Munich, as Id imagine you could down these all day long. This is really a top beer. Strongly recommended. Prost!","Basel, SWITZERLAND","Drinking_77"

Lovely golden yellow color with a matte finish. Lots of carbonation. Enormous, long-lasting head. Thick crown of lace. Incredibly cloudy. Textbook appearance.

Aroma is a dry, leafy aroma, where the cloves smell dried up and ashen. There is a banana, but more like a banana cream pie: muted and blunted. Doesnt have the fresh aromas of ripe bananas.

Flavor is clothes and black pepper. Banana cream pie. A potpourri of dried leaves. Tastes just like autumn. A little salty; definitely triggers some nerves on the back end of the tongue.

They have perfected them.
Paulaner might be the best.
Its a conservative wheat beer, that tastes perfect.
Others have a slightly wilder wheat taste.
So start with Paulaner.
Can only get it in the bottle around NE Ohio.
But its widely available, which is nice.
Far better than any Belgian or American wannabe.
They have been doing it a long time.
For example, the equally great German Wheat Beer by Wenstaphaner has been brewing beer since the year 1080.
Its has a nice wilder wheat taste, and is available on tap at the Winking Lizard restaurant in Peninsila, Ohio.
Other German Hefe-Weizen wheat beers like Schnieder, Franzanhaner, Ayinger are very good too.
Franzenhaner is on tap at the Firehouse Grill in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.

 Poured from bottle into pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a very lightly hazed orange amber color with a thick and billowy white head. The head has fantastic retention fading to leave a decent amount of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is heavy of a yeasty and wheaty aroma. It is mixed with a decent black pepper and banana smell. Quite a classic Hefe aroma and quite nice.

 Taste  The taste begins with flavors of wheat bread and a biscuit maltiness meeting the tongue. A light orange flavor is upfront which seems to grow stronger as the taste advances. While the orange grows stronger, other flavors of a yeasty nature come to the tongue. The biscuit begins to fade with the wheaty tastes and the orange citrus grows even stronger. In the end a light yeast and nice citrus wheat flavor are left on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is quite creamy for an only 5.5 abv brew. It has a moderate to average level of carbonation. The beer sooths the tastebuds as it passes through the mouth. It is great for the tastes of the beer and quite drinkable.

 Overall  A nice easy drinking Hefe with a fantastic transitions and tastes in the flavor. A very nice drinking brew.","","Darkmagus82"

Best of all are the sweet banana and citrus tones with the earthy, spicy yeast note. Paulaners Hefeweizen is built on quality and tradition.

1703,"2014-05-09",3.4,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance was a cloudy/hazy golden orange body, two finger white foamy lumpy head that lasts for a good three minutes and then ends up leaving a spectacular clingy yet somewhat foamy lacing.
The smell was a ""banana""/estery aroma and cloves, light citrus.
The taste was the previously mentioned flavors with a nice big wheat bite, all combined in the aftertaste, dry clove-like finish.
On the palate, it sat about a light to medium, sessionable, carbonation is spot on for the style and for me, also becomes a bit creamy.
Overall, well, hefeweizens are originally from Germany, so its hard to bust on this one period as the Germans know how to make em - very good for its style and very good to me (and that says a lot since Im not a true hefeweizen fan).","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

A: Pours a very hazy orange color. The eggshell-shaded head looks quite dense and sturdy at two fingers tall, but retention is just pretty good. It leaves behind sparse but thick looking lacing behind.

S: There actually isnt much of a focus on esters here, and if there is, its definitely what I would consider more clove-forward. Not much banana or bubblegum. Theres also an earthy, bready tone provided by the combination of malts and yeast - and look! There are some hoppy touches, too! The quality of the aroma subtly sneaks up on me: Im not too impressed at first, but the more I inhale it, the more enticing it becomes.

T: Definitely clove-oriented, balanced out by its mildly fruity midtaste. The latter reminds me somewhat of oranges with a dash of apricot. Some lactose cream pops up right before the swallow and on the finish. Not too complex, just really damn satisfying.

M: This is very crisp and refreshing. Definitely not a dry beer, though, and Im perfectly okay with that. Given how drinkable it already is, a dry finish would ruin it. Low carbonation doesnt impede, either.

As far as taste, people tend to match this to the world famous Erdinger, but the Paulaner is a tad sweeter overall and the palate more complex and leaves a lasting aftertaste. I can get this locally on tap, so I would never consider the bottled version, but Ive been told it can hold its merits. If you drink a Paulaner (or any other notable hefe) just after a hoppy brew say IPA, youll get a shock to the system and probably spit it out immediately and demand another IPA or Pilsener. The banana/abricot sweet and fruity taste dominates totally, and it can really be a turnoff.","Aarhus, DENMARK","beikes"

The head stays big for quite some time, before settling as a 3 mm dense everlasting layer. Good lacing. Strong, sweet, refreshing, crisp and very pleasant aroma with all the usual suspects: sweet fruits (i.e. banana), yeast, spices and perfume, and a sweet malty component that I cant quite nail: is it sweet caramel, or maybe mild sweet honey? The taste is moderate to light sweet, accompanied by a moderate acidity and traces of something bitter. The flavours fit the aroma like a glow, maybe apart from the citric notes (mostly lime) that are a tad more evident on the palate. The body is quite light, which I guess its supposed to be, but Ive had weissens with a bit fuller body which I must say I prefer. Still, the perfect carbonation and the pleasant dryness and that more-ish feeling saves the 4 in Palate. An absolutely top of the line weissbier!

1703,"2012-02-13",4.0,"This is one of my go-to summer beers. Im a huge fan of hefeweizens and other wheat beers but I especially enjoy this one. I think its sometimes seen as THE German hefeweizen and I think there is a reason for that.

Appearance - cloudy and straw-colored, gains clarity as it warms, but tastes best cold.

Smell - delicious, wheat that doesnt overpower.

Taste - also delicious, very crisp and not too much malt presence - something that I think some American hefes struggle with.

Mouthfeel - smooth, perfect, avoid dead yeast at all costs.

Overall - a great example of what wheat can contribute to an already exceptional beer.","Orono, Minnesota, USA","FURLYSURIOUS"

Aromas were pretty nice, with the same banana-ish yogurty body with hints of zest and citrus peel as many other in its category. One thing I appreciated about it is that it pulled its flavors off using the core ingredients, unlike a certain Youngs brew I tasted recently which put a terrible shudder of doubt in me about craft beers but to the point. Taste was zesty and that yogurty smoothness, but with more of a hoppy bite at the end then say, an Erdinger. Complemented by the alcohol warmth at the back. I liked it more than an Erdinger, but dont think it carries its flavors as smoothly as a Hoegaarden. It almost felt like I was drinking two separate drinks in one, with zesty, wheaty goodness at the start then a totally different, almost typical alcohol/hop flavor at the end.

1703,"2011-07-27",4.0,"50cl. bottle from a local supermarket. It pours a hazy light-amber liquid with a high bubbly and spongy white head that lasts beautifully throughout the beer and leaves some lacing. It looks very lively carbonated. The aroma has some grassy hop notes, vanilla and bananas along with an obvious wheaty character, a little yeast and a distant malty base. Not very intense, but complex as it evolves, and nice overall. It tastes likewise but intenser, with more notorious fruity notes of bananas, some distant mild spices and a little citron. It also has a malty touch of caramel. It is medium sweet and has a characteristic and pleasant slight sour touch. In the mouth it feels mild but lively carbonated, thick and creamy, with a medium-full body. It ends dry and very slightly bitter, with a nice aftertaste of bananas, yeast, wheat and a distant herbal hoppiness. Presentation is nice and leaves clear it is a hefeweizen. Pretty cool beer for hot days; a perfect thirst-quencher, but with quite a body.","Sausalito, California, USA","12HundredBaud"

Theres also an uncharacteristic citrusy tartness that tends to override the fruit esters, especially toward the finishing.

1703,"2011-06-23",3.2,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2011 Beautiful, hazy, pale-amber beer with a white head. The aroma has subtle tones of cloves and banana and a rather dominant citrus (lemon and lime, not orange) character that works very well and would have merited higher marks if it were a little less subdued. To the palate it feels thin but creamy, making it very refreshing and extremely easy to drink. The taste is dominated by the wheat and isnt bitter or sour at all. The finish is completely dry and gentle. It leaves some of the ester and citrus notes on the mouth, and also a mineral feel, but neither sticks around for too long. The malts dont really come through. Overall, this is a very pleasant, tried-and-true wheat beer that one could drink all day, but its just really unexciting.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

The aroma has a healthy dose of banana and clove, balanced and fermented well, a nice spicy honeycomb malt undetones. Flavors are spritzy orange, while banana and clove play more of an understated role, peppery yeast finish. Clean, crisp, and refreshing makes for a good hefe, the banana and clove notes are also nicely muted as more interesting citrus and pepper.

Low amount of stickiness, which can be a problem in weissbier. It is a solid one but from the bottle lacks the depth of character it might have in Munchen...bottle in Guilin poured by server without the yeast is strangely clear but with very thick lasting head.

1703,"2011-02-08",4.1,"A very good brew.

12 oz. bottle, into 16 oz. Shaker

Appearance: 2"" of beautiful, frothy head that disappeared very slowly.  Dark orange color, very cloudy.  Appearance is right-on for the variety.

Aroma: Typical Hefe notes.  Heavier on banana than some hefes - I like the mixture of aromas here.  Yeastiness is also present, but not overwhelming.

Taste: Delicious.  Perfect amount of sweetness. 

Palate: Appropriate amount of carbonation - not exceedingly bubbly -- just right.  Creamy texture, and relatively heavy body for a hefe.  One off note in this beer is the slightly bitter finish that I was not expecting.

Overall: A very good hefe.  Not as good as some of the best, but for what is really a macrobrew, this is very good.  My main reservation on this, which resulted in the slightly downgraded aroma and overall scores, was that this hefe seemed to lack character.","Wheeling, Illinois, USA","JamesCory"

1703,"2010-11-30",3.5,"Poured from a 500mL bottle into a traditional weizen glass.

A: Pours a dark apricot peach color with a torrent of bubbles rising upward before joining the monstrous four-finger head that has emerged after a standard pour. Lacing is left behind as the wavy head finally begins to recede.

S: Initial whiff is of course the German hefe yeast. This one seems to favor banana and, to a lesser extent, clove over the third member of the triumvirate--bubblegum. Im also detecting a faint hint of nuttiness, which adds a nice touch. As it warms up, a little bit more bubblegum characteristic comes through, replacing some of the initial banana.

T: Surprisingly, a good amount of malt comes through alongside the yeast in this. The aftertaste, however, is dominated by clove and banana. A little bit of soft pink bubblegum on the palate.

M: Medium body with a good amount of creaminess. Some bitterness comes through. Moderate carbonation.

D: Pretty drinkable, although it doesnt have the intensity or intricacies that I look for in a really outstanding hefeweizen.

I would expect the malt to be lighter, allowing the wheat and yeast to come through more.

Not quite syrupy but still heavier than I would expect. Moderately to very sweet on the palate: honey, orange, and a little bit of peach are what I get. Still goes down fairly clean.

1703,"2010-03-15",4.0,"Bottle.

A - Cloudy, golden tangerine color. Large foamy head with a off-white/cream color.

S - For the most part traditional Hefe smells. Wheat is in the forefront. Also some banana, bubblegum, and clove. Also had a slight lemon citrus and mineral smell.

T - Wheat provides the base for this, but it seemed to have a bit more of an earthy/grainy taste than other beers with wheat as the main base (particularly other Hefes). Banana, bubblegum, and honey interplay with the clove and lemon giving it a slightly sweet taste with a little kick to it.

M - Medium to light body and decent carbonation. Definitely a smooth drink but not as creamy as what I was expecting.

D - Good as it is light on the tongue and in the belly it is easy to drink a number of these. Flavors wont overpower your palate, but linger long enough that you want more.

Notes: Good summer brew, like most Hefes. Solid example of the style, I found it a bit lighter and less creamy than others, but thats not necessarily a bad think (a could be a good think as far as drinkability), however the flavor is also not as intense.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Appearance: Opaque, pear juice color w/ huge, creamy head that dissipated rather quickly. The head was initially so huge that my 19 oz glass couldnt contain it. Impressive!

Smell: Fruity, some apple and pineapple with a citrus twist.

Taste: Tangy pear mixed with lemon flavor, somewhat sweet. None of the banana or vanilla that I expected. Very slight bitter finish that counters the sweetness some.

Mouthfeel: Creamy but moderate carbonation, a little syrupy.

Drinkability: Perhaps too sweet and syrupy for me to want more than one in a single session. I love that it didnt leave a bitter aftertaste.

1703,"2009-08-06",3.6,"She practically glows a gentle white in my glass with a brushing of soft yellows and orange. Her head is equally as soft and voluptuously white as the snow, melting only ever so slightly into a blanket of snow-white foam. She swirls nicely, and even though no lace is left in her wake, her head remains stubbornly unmoved. Well played, indeed. Waiting for me is the ultimate banquet of German hefeweizen delights: ripe bananas, banana bread fresh from the oven and sprinkled throughout with nuts, clove aromatics abound, greatly assisted by soft white wheat, orange esters, and a sprinkling of coriander. There is almost no greater bouquet of aromas. I could sit here all day long breathing her in, but then she would grow too warm and I would be remiss in neglect. Lips wet with anticipation, I dive into her bounty with a generous first quaff. As a blanket of lace follows her deep into her first quaff, my palate is softly greeted by a gentle embrace and a smooth creamy mouthfeel. A clean finish with orange peel, cloves, and banana lingering long into my breath. I wonder which is more aromatically pungent to anothers senses, cloves or garlic? Personally, I could care less. Drinking deep once more, my palate is caressed by soft bananas, rich banana bread, nuts, and a brisk zip of lemon nipping at her heels. The more I quaff, the more her cloves permeate while the wheat acts as a life raft for her over-ripe bananas, banana bread, and oranges. Quaffing bliss, I sup, savor, and repeat until she is no more. All that remains is a scattered patchwork of puffy lace and an aroma of memories that linger long into her finish.


Yum. German hefeweizens; you either love them or you hate them. Me, I love them heart and soul. I can drink them any day of the week, any month of the year, but I enjoy them most in the summer. Thankfully, summer in Florida lasts twice as long as anywhere else, so that is twice as long that I get to enjoy the Paulaner Hefeweizen.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Good thickness though.Could have 4 or 5 of these on a hot summer day and love every one of them. Overall this is maybe in my top 3 or 4 hefeweizens I have ever had.

1703,"2008-09-08",4.1,"Date: 09/08.08, 12 oz. bottle
Aroma - Banana, clove, light fruit and grain all contribute to a traditional hefe aroma
Appearance - Cloudy yellow orange that has to be poured carefully because of the explosive, billowing white head that shows good durability.
Flavor - Excellent balance of flavors with the fruitiness of the malt complementing a light wheaty tartness and soft dryness at the finish. 
Palate - Light body, healthy carbonation, smooth and clean palate
Overall - A very fine hefeweizen in the classic tradition from one of Bavaria’s most respected brewers.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"

Aftertaste leaves some more of the esters on the tounge. A very light bodied brew that seems to quench very well and is not on the sweet side, but still makes its presence felt. Good, but not my favorite Hefe.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Wheatness is quity light, but instead of that there are some bitterness and hops in the flavour. Carbonation is balanced and so this is quite smooth to drink.

On tap / Bottle brown 500 ml, extract of wort 12,5 %, unfiltered, pasteurized>
Appearance: Pours cloudy, murky to muddy body, orange and wheat in colour, reminding carrot juicemixed with apple juice, some hints of metalic hue, body looks medium, density is average. Head is initially large, then slowly decreases to small and remains for a long time, frothy in structure and perfectly white like a fresh snow.lacing is present but rather small. Carbonation of the body is visually medium.
Aroma: Nice, strong aroma of a good quality wheat and wheat malt together with mellow yeasty background, strenghtened by gentle, aromatic and a bit grassy refreshing hops. When you plongue deeper into the aroma you can feel barley malt, orange, banana and fresh toasty bread and wheat rolls. A hint of carrot juice.
Flavour:Texture is very smooth, mild. Components are very well balanced and the taste is full. Front is mellow, smooth, yeasty and hoppy with its freshnass and herbal aromatic nose. Then comes some mild carbonation and moves through a tongue. You can natice wheat grains and barley grainy malt, toasty, floury, white fresh bread, very well balanced and reach flavour, satisfying the consumer and completely achieving its goal. Banana and orange peal is distinguishable, flowery nose, some bitterness in the aftertaste of hoppy origin but playing nice impression together with slight accidity in the beer texture from carbonation.
Palate:Body is medium, texture is creamy, carbonation on palate is soft to medium and the beer seems naturally effervescent, finish feel is smooth, mellow, creamy, alcohol is well hidden.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

dec.21.2009.por muito tempo, essa Hefeweizen alemã ocupou o posto de melhor cerveja de trigo em minha opinião. Não é pra menos. Sua belíssima aparência é capitaneada por uma espuma de aparência inicial média, coloração branca e boa formação de colarinho, com boa longevidade. O que a torna tão apetitosa, no entanto, é seu corpo turvo e de grossa densidade, de tonalidade âmbar amarelado. Seu aroma, clássico, comporta notas concentradas de banana e cravo. Seu agradável e refrescante sabor é levemente ácido no início, tornando-se levemente amargo no final, este de curta duração. O paladar é composto de um corpo médio, de textura cremosa, carbonatação borbulhante e final levemente adstringente.","União da Vitória, BRAZIL","danielyabu"

When they dont have this or Hoegaarden, Im kind of annoyed because its all I want. Hanging out and talking to friends, drinking these, it just yields a perma-grin. I imagine the purists scoff at the lemon, but it just came with it the first time I ordered it and it was great. So refreshing. And the lemon seeds rise up and down in it as the bubbles form and pop. This is a thirst-quenching beer with excellent fresh flavor. And yet its somehow also just a bit warm in the throat, inside or simultaneous with the chill.

Pours with a frothy, three-finger thick, light tan colored head that sits atop an opaquely hazy, orangish gold colored beer.  Lots of wheat & malt aromas are apparent as are some of the characteristic yeast notes; Aromas of clove, lemon zest, fresh crushed wheat, at times notes of bananas, sweet grain notes and some yeasty / bready aromatics.  This beer has a nice level of yeast-driven phenolics & esters to it.  Quite a nice nose to this brew really.

The taste has a sweetness that seems more driven by notes of clove & banana esters than by the grain sweetness; the wheat and barley malts do contribute some sweetness though.  The carbonation provides a sharp bite to this brew, which, along with the light tartness & touch of hop bitterness, provide balance to the sweeter notes of this brew.  There is a certain spiciness here that is most definitely yeast derived, but also brought on by the zesty carbonation / carbonic acid; hints of white pepper, lemon zest and maybe even a hint of wisp ginger.

1703,"2007-04-25",4.4,"Let me iterate firstly that I have always been impartial to wheat/white beers. I really enjoy the citrus taste and find it a delicious alternative to the bitter side of beer when I need reprieve. 

This beer has a foamy bright white head that dissipates at a medium to slow pace. 

The taste is leans towards being one sided as most beers this style tend to be, though the individuality of the ingredients  is best enjoyed without the usual orange/lemon slice thats served in the glass.

The beer itself is gorgeous. A delightfully opaque bright orange glow accentuates the thick, sediment laden character of the beer, usually leaving flavorful sediment in the bottom of the glass/bottle you drink it from. 

Ive had this beer a thousand times either in a bottle or on tap -- its always a treat. Especially when you need to town down from a recent IPA binge. 

I seem to bounce between these two styles of beer semi-regularly.","USA","hopsaddict"

Smell; oranges and lemons, ripe bananas and bubblegum. Theres a nice bready/yeasty aroma, with a bit af a grassy/hay quality to it. The smell is really inviting, I have to make myself take a sip.

Taste; nice hints of oranges and lemons without being overly powerful. Ripe bananas stand out, as well as bread dough. I like how the wheat comes out without being heavy, as well as a nice spiciness with cloves in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a nice carbonation that makes this vary easy to drink.

1703,"2006-01-28",4.7,"Beer. Its whats for breakfast. At least it is in Munich, Germany. If you ever venture to Munich, you will find hefeweizen, an unfiltered wheat beer, served in the Munich beer halls with a mid morning snack of weisswurst sauages. There are many outstanding examples of this style to be found in Munich, and one of my favorite examples is Paulaner Hefeweizen from the Paulaner Brauerei of Munich, Germany. I enjoyed this beer at the Paulaner Im Platz in Munich, and it is a classic example of what a Southern Bavarian hefeweizen should taste like. 

While most of the beers I drank in Germany were vom fass, this is a style that is actually intended to be bottled, as it is sedimented with yeast, where the beer continues to condition and develop. It is really something to watch a waiter or bartender in Munich pour one for you in the proper weissbier glass. Hefeweizen is a tart and thirst quenching beer, and has aromas and flavors of clove, banana, pear, and even bubble gum, from the use of a very distinctive ale yeast strain. Paulaner Hefeweizen is a very popular beer both in Germany and in the United States. It can be found in markets outside of Munich, as I enjoyed this beer in other parts of Germany, and Im happy to say I enjoy it here in the US quite often as well. 

Paulaner Hefeweizen pours to a beautiful, hazy and opaque pale golden color with a thick, tall, rocky head, and a very lively carbonation. It is important to rouse the ring of yeast that clings to the bottom of the bottle as yeast is a major aroma and flavor component in this beer. Just leave an ounce before you empty the bottle, swirl it, and let the yeast pour into your glass. The nose on this beer is wonderful with lots of aromas of clove and banana. The palate is firm with good tart wheat malt flavor paired with estery fruity flavors of banana and pear, and perhaps even apple. Paulaner Hefeweizen finishes with more wheat and estery fruit flavors, then finishes with a spicy clove finish that lingers. 

A really impressive example of hefeweizen from one of Munichs best brewers. Paulaner has made a real push into other markets in Germany, and their beers and restaurant/brewpubs can be found all over Germany. Their beers are popular here in the US, and can be found in a number of markets here. If you see this beer in your market, it is well worth giving a try. It works well with lots of dishes, and is a great beer to drink with in the warm weather, and yes, a great beer to have for breakfast!","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Poured a medium dark amber with a huge head that took over 2 minutes to subside to 2 fingers. Some nice lacing formed after the dense foam waned. Smell is mostly of yeast, with a slight fruitiness. Taste was just like the smell with a banana / cloves / lemon flavor blending well with the yeast  and wheat taste. Smoother than I anticipated. Very slight carbonated banana aftertaste. My wife said she tasted spearmint, though I did not. Like the commercial description says, it is indeed a very crisp, refreshing beer.

Quite soft in carbonation, medium-light in body and initially creamy in mouthfeel. Subtle mix of toasted malts, sweet banana and pear, and tangy lemons and grapefruit.

1703,"2005-09-17",3.6,"Bottle (330ml).  Poured murky orange with a huge slightly off-white creamy-rocky head.  Aroma strong with banana esters, tobacco ash, sweet malt, spices (coriander, pepper), a bit of hops and wheat.  Taste is a bit tart, very citrusy (lemon/orange), with some hop bitterness and sweet malt, spices and the ash bitterness overall - very mild flavour, really, light asgtringent mouthfeel.  Quite pleasant, not overly memorable, but one of the nicer Hefeweiss beers Ive tried.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
1703,"2005-09-12",3.5,"(500 ml bottle: $1.99 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) So, perhaps the defacto standard for German Hefeweizens.  It pours with a big, tall, bubbly head, just slightly off-white in color, and it sure is taking its sweet time dropping down to a size where I can actually take a sip of beer.  So while Im waiting for that, the color is a beautiful bright orange-golden, and of course is fully cloudy, and thats without disturbing any of the abundant sediment on the bottom of the bottle.  Ill attempt to disturb that in subsequent pours, however.  The nose is packed with fairly strong banana-like esters and a moderate phenolic aroma.  Not getting too much of the typical clove smell, and the wheat aroma seems to be overrun by the banana, but the nose is still very inviting.  Well, what do you know, the head has finally died down a bit.  With as much banana as there is in the nose, I expected the flavor would share the same characteristic, but the banana is more restrained here.  I also expected it to taste sweeter, but the sweetness is pretty mild as well.  This balance allows the wheat flavor to really stand out more than in most Hefeweizens.  Bitterness is very mild.  And finally, theres a touch of clove in the finish, putting a nice cap on this baby.  Body is medium, with gentle carbonation for a smooth mouthfeel.  I think I can see why this is often considered the standard for the style.  Well-balanced, well-crafted and thoroughly enjoyable.  But I never could break up that yeast pack lining the bottom of the bottle.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Unfortunately we can only get the .33l bottles instead of the .51 (hey its better then nothing).  

I find this hefe to be the perfect blend with just enough yeast to give it a smooth sweet flavor (just a bit less then Hacker Pschorr which I also love).

Ive found the date and storage of this beer to be very important.  As this beer gets older the flavor changes and the yeast become harder and harder to whip up from the bottom.

It has all the elements you expect to find in a cloudy wheat, but times ten. Brash, brassy and so exaggerated it all gets a bit extreme.

1703,"2004-06-12",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2011 Ah Paulaner my old friend. I discovered you at age 22. 10 full years before my rate beer obsession. For most of those years you were my only thought when wheat beers came to mind. Sure now and then I would cheat. Would see some other wheaty behind your back. But baby, I always came back, and you have always been there for me. Rarely has a month gone by when you were not there by my side, though I must confess that months would sometimes pass between the times I would grab you and take you for my own. Sigh. I guess the glitter comes off all relationships at some point. I even remember 1995 when Jurgen the German exchange student came to live with us. He was so thrilled the first time he opened the fridge and saw you there. He claimed that he had you all the time when he was in Germany. I felt proud. I felt the love. And I knew you were my baby. And I trusted you baby - you never failed me. Now I know I have not been as attentive as I should be. And I have been indiscreet in leaving a cyber trail of wheaty romances on my Ratebeer stats list. Now baby, dont be mad. Dont go. Yeah sure Ive been with Weihenstephaner, and ok yeah Ayinger too, but baby you still matter to me.Let me hold your 16.9 oz brown bottle once again. Enjoy the cloudy orange color as you slip into something more quaffable. The large orange head still brings a smile to my face. I can still smell your strong orange and wheat scent. It made my taste buds come alive with desire. Your taste, so full of orange and wheat. True, I am a dog. Yes I have other wheaties on my mind.

""It's really good.""
Alternately, a one-word review would consist of: ""ahhh.""
The Paulaner Hefe-weizen is the epitomy of refreshing and a great beer for the thirsty drinker. Actually, if I was going out, I don't know if this would be my first choice but if I'm coming in from a day of yard work, I know it would be.
It pours a cloudy light orange with a head that stays for weeks. It just looks good, which in this case means we can judge a beer by its color.
The aroma is quite complex with fruity, spicy tones (cloves, perhaps?). The smell is great but it's the taste we should get to...and quickly! On first taste, I tried to find the banana that I read so much about in other reviews but I couldn't. I did taste a very pronounced citrus and the spiciness that I detected on smelling was hard to detect on taste.
The strongest characteristic of this beer is its drinkability. I have never had a beer that packs such a punch in the taste department that is so drinkable. This is great for those hot days when you need a thrst quiencher but it can be so very dangerous on thos nights out when you shouldn't drink too much.
All-in-all a wonderful beer.","Addison, Texas, USA","kindestcut"

Ahh...thats better. This tastes amazingly fresh and fruity with just the right amount of malt balanced in so nothing is really overwhelming. But the taste is pretty fruity, kinda lemony/orangey with some vanilla and a nice robust malt backing. Man is it smooth with just the right amount of fruity tang hold.

1703,"2002-05-01",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 6, 2007 The original rate was based on a perfect pour one that has eluded me for at least a year and a half. So I feel it is now to rate the present. Not the freshes bottle with a brew date of 12/06, but that seems typical to as of late. Still a wonderful looking pour, but this one is a bit darker, which I like as much or better than the lighter version. Sweet wheat with just a touch of banana, Im not catching the full malt and light spice of the past. Light sweet wheat flavors with a stronger phenol presence, more resin than banana and spice. Again the base malt is not fully apparent. Still a nice hefe, just doesnt seem to have the depth and complexity I used to find in one out of ever three to four barrels. Maybe my memory is slipping, but I dont think so.  Straw color with a head that doesnt end.  When fresh, I consider this the one to compare to others in the ""light"" (as opposed to the Ur Style) hefe style.  Clove and banana phenols dance across the tongue in balance with the wheat and malt sweetness.

One of the best-smelling beers, too.

4/18/02:  beautiful cloudy amber, with huge lasting head; awesome nose of banana/chocolate, citrus, apples, and yeast.  Flavor almost as wonderful, ultra-malty for a wheat; but perhaps doesn't have enough 'edge' to it -- could use a bit more carbonation, a bit more oomph in the finish.  I've been slowly going through a lot of my pre-Ratebeer faves lately; this one holds up quite well, though probably not a top-ten all-time anymore.  Best German wheat, still a possibility.

Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Pretty ordinary example, with a slightly odd tartness character (a bit like fruit juice).

1703,"2002-01-27",3.9,"Well, before beginning this review I have to admit that  I generally dislike weiss bier, which gives my weiss bier-loving friend no end of fits. That said, the flavor here is quite superb. The fruitiness doesnt overwhelm my poor, misguided dark beer-loving palate the way other weiss beers do. It hits the tongue (as does the fruity bite of the aroma) and lingers without making me miss the taste of hops, dark roast, bitter etc.    A gateway beer for non-weiss fans? Id say so. I just hope that doesnt damn it to those who like weiss beers. I first drank it in mini-kegs at an Oktoberfest event, and I wanted to make sure that the quantity imbibed (all you can drink) didnt affect my enjoyment of this beer.
