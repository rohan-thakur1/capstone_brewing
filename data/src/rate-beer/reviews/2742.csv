2742,"2012-05-06",3.8,"Draught at Fermentoren, CopenhagenCloudy copper color, creamy head. It has a very nice, fresh, fruity aroma; apricot jam and mango; followed later by a yeasty and manure touch. Lean and drinkable body, with a good malt caramel and toffee flavor; the malts provide a light residual sweetness, and the hops a certain resiny and fruity touch; but I find the bitterness exaggerated, therefore creating an unbalancing effect. In the end it gets difficult to stand in big quantities, although its a very good beer.Rough.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
