2114,"2013-07-03",4.7,"My Bottom Line:
On the softest cushion of straw-like cereals converse citrusy, leafy and coniferous hops, a harmonious moment which is so comfortable you dont want it to ever end.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A mole hill of white foam produces lots of lacing around the misty gold.
-The mouthfeel on this one is a 6 out of 5. The amazing cellaring job at The Harp and The Evening Star helps too.
-The flavour dosage is just perfect for a quencher. Subtle enough to make you want more and more, intense enough to make you smile after every sip.
-Drinkability is through the roof.
-The finish is to die for. All ingredients converge, a tightly-woven tapestry of flavour that lingers on the palate until you are compelled to the next gulp. And a large gulp its going to be
-From a North Americans point of view, the name of this beer may be misleading. This is not a hop bomb or a low gravity version of an American IPA. Its just the perfect conceived quencher, from both the malt AND hop fronts.
-Is this Unetice 10 of England? It may very well be
-The pints I had at The Edgar Wallace and The Evening Star were still excellent, but not the world beater I fell in love with at The Harp. Went back to The Harp three times over the course of 2 weeks and it was a world-beater every single time!

2114,"2005-06-05",2.4,"[cask at dba NY] when an American sees the term ""hophead"" attached to the name of a beer, he gets certain expectations - the American, used to the brutal, ""unrefined,"" palate-assaulting, paint-peeling flavor of a Dreadnaught and a Ruination expects that something named Hophead brings the promise of a mouth-puckering attack of hops - the American, obviously a plebeian that doesnt appreciate the subtle nuances of a good golden ale, remarks, ""this doesnt taste like much of anything at all; where the hell are the hops?"" - yes, there are some very subtle touches of grapfruit and grain, but, he thinks, ""cant the British make anything besides Bitters and Golden Ales, I mean, really, come on.""  But the American just doesnt know what hes talking about.  His palate is ruined by all of those high gravity American monstrosities that shouldnt even be called beer, what with their deviations from tradition and sense of experimentation.

Aug, 2003 Gravity, Frog & Toad Body Parts Beer Festival.  Blond Ale. A lemon or Chardonnay colour - quite attractive for a blonde. Fragrant floral hops. Gentle citric tang - mostly soft grapefruit sprinkled with brown sugar, but theres an element of orange and a hint of vanilla pod just dipped into the brew. Light to medium body - refreshing and satisfying. Finishes soft with a long lingering dryness. Spanking. The beer of the festival. [4.0]
March, 2005 Dog & Bone, Gillingham.  Foam head and creamy texture because the beer was pulled through a sparkler. White lilly aroma. Vanilla and caramel and oily hops. Served cool. Sparkler spoils the beer. [3.2]
June, 2005 JDW, Boston, Lincs. Fresh & fruity with passion fruit and citric notes. This is a great beer, but it does like to be well treated to show its best bits. [3.4]
July, 2009 Darnly Arms, Cobham Lovely soapy drink. Slight toffee - milk toffee. [3.3]
Christmas Eve, 2015 500ml dark bottle, filtered, from Asda or Tesco. I like this when served in top condition from the cask. As it is a delicate, soft beer, best served fresh, its not so good when not kept well, or when not too fresh. Filtered in the bottle its fairly flat and ordinary, with the hops dominating to the extent that the malt is barely present.  Each to their own - some people are not interested in malt flavour and character, preferring the taste of hops; but if, like me, you enjoy malt, then ignore the bottle, and seek out the cask - theres really no comparison.
