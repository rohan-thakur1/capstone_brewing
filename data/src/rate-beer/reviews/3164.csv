3164,"2015-12-19",4.5,"On tap at Falling Rock. Pours orange with paperthin off white head that diminishes to nothing. The aroma is strong white peach, oak, funk. Thin mouth, tart peach, oak, stone fruit, so balanced, crisp, really impressive.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3164,"2015-07-31",3.2,"Draft. Clear golden orange pour with minimal head. Acetic peach aroma with mild funkiness. Flavor has a bit more malt sweetness than Id like with some mild vinegar tartness. Touch of honey in there. A little flat on the palate. Hey, Flat Abbey! What you gonna do? Sorry to rag on this hyped rare beer, but it was only pretty good.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
3164,"2015-05-20",4.0,"Draft. Liquid gold, perfect clarity. No head to speak of. Sour yet bready aroma. I get vinegar, dough, baking bread and a subtle funk. The flavors delightful -- not incredibly sour, but pleasantly tart. Sourdough, lemon juice, honey, a hint of barnyard and apple. Sweet at first, then sourness lifts through the finish. Medium body. Acidity builds but doesnt get out of control. Lacks the bells and whistles of most LA sours, but shows that theyre unnecessary when the base is so solid. Incredibly drinkable, flavorful and clean.","","PartyFowle"
3164,"2015-02-19",4.0,"Pouring at EBF 2014. Pours a clear gold with a thin white head. Soft musk, sweet funk. Sweet and fruity, tart acid. Bright and sweet, acid and tang. Lovely. A touch acetic, but good acid and lemon notes bring it back.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
3164,"2014-11-09",4.7,"On tap at Urge. Yellowish/orange pour with no real head. Mildly sour stone fruit bouquet. Delicious sour stone fruit notes dominate. Nice malty backbone. Wonderful oak and barrel nuisances. Fantastic mouthfeel with a perfect body.","Florida, USA","50belair"
3164,"2014-08-13",4.6,"Draft pour at Toronado. Pours a golden color with a sweet and sour peach aroma. Intense sour fruit flavor with peach and orange. Juicy, with a long lingering sour finish. Amazing beer to say the least. Loved it.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
3164,"2014-08-01",4.3,"This is an amazing beer. Smooth cascade of sour peaches that flow into a crisp, tart preach. So much intensity but bone dry. Amazing beer!","San Francisco, California, USA","MrDick"
3164,"2014-07-20",4.1,"On tap at Harrys Hofbrua. This is a great beer! Hazy golden with a full white head (perhaps aided by an over gassed keg that needed some settling). Beer had fresh peach and tart aroma. Taste is well balanced tart sourness with supportive yeasty and bread backing. Nice ripe white fruit.","Redwood City, California, USA","Zymurgeist2"
3164,"2014-07-19",4.9,"Epic! On draft at LA during the Christmas in July event. Tons of peach freshness at only 5+ ABV! As always, Lost Abbey killing it. Thanks Tomme Arthur for the free Veritas tickets!","","want1DIPA"
3164,"2014-06-28",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 29, 2014 Tap at the Ale Arsenal 2nd Anniversary. Pours hazy brilliant apricot butterscotch, no head, no lacing, but a beautiful color. Aroma is heavy peach, barnyard funk, lemon, some oak. Flavor is fruity and bright, a bit of initial sweetness fading quickly to medium tart, stone fruit, but not necessarily peach specific, skins and pits, lemon, barnyard. Lingering tartness. Medium body, flat. Pretty nice. I wish it had some carbonation, but... Lost Abbey.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3164,"2014-06-13",4.1,"Tap at Capitol Beer in Sacramento, CA. Pours light amber with no head. LIght sour aroma. Flavor is quite tart. Its even very sour light stone fruit. I shudder at each delicious quaff. Sour doesnt seem brett. Its not very earthy. Finishes dang sour and fruity. And really shockingly sour to the end. Woot!","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
3164,"2014-05-29",4.6,"A well carbonated, fruity LA sour so its basically a guaranteed winner. Fresh peachiness and a nice lactic tartness. Not funky but really delicious, better than peak FF by my analysis.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
3164,"2014-05-12",3.7,"Pours cloudy and orange gold, small white head, dissipates quickly. Aroma is funky and peachy, fairly jammy, good deal of funk. Quite sour, lots of peach sourness, loses some delicacy, could be cleaner but interesting enough I guess. Lots of pucker, a little thick.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3164,"2014-05-12",3.9,"Draft at the 2014 Anniversary Party. Semi cloudy golden pour, with a white head. Sour green apple, peach juice, lactic acid, funk, hay, yogurt, musty, and lemon. Weird beer, quite sour. I like it.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
3164,"2014-04-29",3.7,"On tap @ Provisions Market. Hazed orange pour with a small white head. Nice sour peach candy aroma, some oak, green apple, and lemon juice. A touch of musty funk, hay, and yogurt. Fairly sour taste. Big time lactic acidity. Tons of lemon, green apple, and peach. Sour peach candies, yogurt, and some grass. Wet hay, oak, and a slight blue cheese on the finish.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3164,"2014-04-19",3.4,"This beer has a cloudy yellow color. It smells like sour apples. A really good sour flavor which is very well done. It not overpowering.

3164,"2014-04-11",3.7,"On tap at Falling Rock. Golden appearance with a fully diminishing head. Tart, sour and fruity with notes of lacto, pepper and light herbs. Light body, ample carbonation.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
3164,"2014-04-11",3.9,"Pour from tap at What the Funk!? 2014. Appearance is hazy orange pour with a huge white head and great lacing - kind of ironic this one has so much carbonation. Lemony, lactic, light vanilla, huge citrus notes, pepper, and somewhat cheesy aroma. Taste is sour lemons, lacto, vanilla, oak, peach skin, stone fruit, a touch of salt, orange juice, and grass with a big sour finish. Light body with high carbonation. Pretty solid sour.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
3164,"2014-03-28",4.0,"Draught at Publick House, 3/20/14Very hazy peach-copper colored body has some lazy bubbles rising, though no head to speak of.Tons of lactic and acetic acid in the nose, fairly aggressive but tempered (sweetened) by the peach juice. Some definite funk in there, for sure, but the stronger acetic notes always seem to drown out the more interesting potential lacto/pedio/brett notes (mustiness, cheesiness, sun-baked cow poop, horse sweat). Anyways, theres still some definite leather and a bit of cheesiness. Well give it a 6.5 on the Funk-O-Meter. That being said, I still like the aceto-lactic-peach nose and think it works very well. No alcohol or flaws noted.Flavor is pretty damned unique...peach sugars and heavy acetic and lactic sourness battle it out and the mouth goes through a rollercoaster ride of tartness, sweetness and heavy sourness on the end. Fortunately, the sourness does win out in the end, and the beer never comes off as too sweet. Still a touch of syrupiness to be found and the flavors are very aggressive. Certainly not a contemplative gueuze, but then, Im sure its not intended as such. The acids are lip-smackingly delcious and I love the abv. Probably going to be unbelievable a year from now, once the peach subsides a little and the acetic levels drop.  Assuming theres any left...","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3164,"2014-03-26",4.1,"Taster at EBF. Lightly hazy honey-colored. Aroma is peach, overripe pineapple, white grape, lambic-like, bright lemons, funky brett. Really nice. Taste is surprisingly creamy sour peach gummis, lemon, puckering acidity, bright, delicious. Outstanding.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","dfroms"
3164,"2014-03-26",4.0,"Échantillonné du Extreme beer fest 2014: Un agréable mélange de montée vinaigrées, fromagées, beurrées et surettes avec un voile de pêches mûres. Buvabilité naturelle.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
3164,"2014-03-23",4.7,"sample at extreme beer fest, this best beer at the event. I went up for this one so many times. Tons of tartness and peach flavors, very complex and fruity. This is amazing, the best sours ever made. Soft carbonation and little head.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3164,"2014-03-22",4.0,"Draft. Hazy gold pour with a barely there thin white head. Nose is sweet funk, peach. Taste is sweet tart peach and some hay. A bit acidic. Good.","Buffalo, New York, USA","Miked1687"
3164,"2014-03-22",4.7,"One of the best sours Ive ever had. Pours lower carbonation golden color. Aroma is huge juicy peaches, lactic yogurt tartness, solid geuezy type funk that adds some dairy and basement funk. I love it.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
3164,"2014-03-22",3.9,"Pours orange with a thick off white lacing. The aroma consists heavily of peaches and white vineager starts sour and finishes sweet","Westfield, Massachusetts, USA","dogfish120love"
3164,"2014-03-10",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2014 Fresh on tap. Another great sour offering from Lost Abbey. A few friends said they liked it, but it was too sweet. I didn't mind the sweetness, thought I am usually sensitive to this.","","WillDunn"
3164,"2014-02-05",4.5,"On tap, think Duck Duck Spontaneous with more peaches. Pours turbid, murky, bright orange with an almost pink hue at times. Aroma is reminiscent of peach flavored looza juice, red grapefruit, guava, passionfruit, nectarine, wood, and barn. Flavor is just as ridiculous with lactic funk, lemon/peach skins, and puckery, peach flavored gummy rings. Unbelievably sour and tart wild ale from Lost Abbey. Cheers Tomme.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
