caramel in it and the smoke somewhere in the background. Beautiful

2136,"2005-11-15",2.8,"(500 ml swing-top bottle: Obtained in trade with bogdi1, thanks Juha!, and shared with SDbruboy) We are sampling this immediately after the incredible Finlandia Sahti, but this is quite a letdown in comparison.  First problem was the complete lack of noise and carbonation rush when flipping the ceramic top of the bottle.  Not a good sign there.  And whoa, the odor emanating from the bottle is a bit off-putting.  It smells like funk and barnyard, so quite the contrast from the Finlandias spice and banana right off the bat.  Pouring the beer, its lifeless and flat, with absolutely no head developing, not even a filmy layer.  The body is a dark ruddy amber to light brown in color, and its fully cloudy.  The nose shows some banana and bubblegum, but Im still getting more of the barnyard and funk than anything else.  Flavors are sweet and fruity, spicy, plenty of banana and bubblegum.  There is some tartness when first sipped, but that picks up in the finish, which is most welcomed.  There is a light spicy bitterness in the finish as well.  As this sahti sits in the glass, it begins to open up a bit and resemble the Finlandias similarity to a German hefeweizen, with the nose slowly transforming to show more of the spice and banana and less of the funk.  Still, nothing close to how wonderful the Findlandia smelled.  As expected, the palate is flat and lifeless, but showing medium ""plus"" body.  Its not difficult to imagine that being flat has had a huge negative impact on virtually all elements of this beer.  Unfortunately, the seal must have been faulty to some extent, even though there was no visible leaking when I opened the package, and I can only go by what I have experienced today.  It showed similar characteristics of the Finlandia, so at least I feel Ive gained a better appreciation of the style.  Ill definitely have to try this again if at all possible.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
2136,"2005-11-14",2.7,"2005 bottle, shared by DarkElf - thanks Stephen.  Pours cloudy, slightly ruddy dark amber with no head whatsoever.  Medium intensity aroma with bananas, spice and notes of other non-descript organic matter.  Flavor starts sweet with banana and ripe fruit, though muted overall, as sweetness fades, a tart earthy bitterness becomes more pronounced then gives way to a herbal finish.  My wife declared it to taste lke mulled cider and I think thats a pretty good approximation as well.  Medium to full body and no carbonation - flat and heavy in the mouth.  Based on some of the other descriptions, its possible that we got a below average sample of this stuff, or perhaps I just dont know enough about Sahti, but I have to say it wasnt all that spectacular.","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"
2136,"2005-09-06",4.2,"2005 bottle from my sahti connection, bogdi1.  Sampled on 8/26 and 8/27 with Eyedrinkale and Egajdzis.Pours a copper-amber color, unfiltered, with some ripe plum-reddish-auburn tinges on the edges.  Nice foamy head is eggshell to beige, laces well but like most bottled sahtis, is not long retained.  Aroma of juniper, pale grains, thick honey and dough and an extremely funky mix of dry yeast, sweet toffee, clove and light bananas.  Fruity and lightly pungent.  Flavor begins with a light sourness, plenty of banana and juniper, with thick caramel and brown bread.  Cidery and dry, with notes of berry skins, buttercream and green apples.  A lovely mouthfeel is, perhaps, my favorite part.  Expansive bubbles burst on the palate, with an unfiltered, substantial body, juicy and coating on the tongue.  The sourness is, as Carlo says, perfectly balanced with the sweetness.  At once light and refreshing, but then sweet and satisfying.  Fantastic stuff.  So good, I had to drink the second bottle right away.  Never did find any smoked flavors, though I was looking for them.  But thats ok, this stuff is wonderful with or without smoked notes.
