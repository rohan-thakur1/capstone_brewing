Cinnamon? Sweet full mouthfeel. Light riped apples in the finish. Not as fruit forward as most schramms.","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
4134,"2017-02-02",4.5,"Shared at a bottle share, hosted by Mickey before the U-of-M game on October 10 (2015). Somehow this one eluded entry as well. Damn, I need to step my game up. Nicole shared this 375 mL bottle. As soon as its opened, there are sweet apples everywhere. The pour is a beautiful, clear darker gold without any visible carbonation, head, or lace. There are just a few legs of alcohol on the glass. The aroma is magical. There is apple for days! Light flesh, a touch of skin, and a resounding sweetness from the honey. There is a hint of vanilla, and maybe a touch of spice, but then there is a distinct alcohol wave. The flavor is just as good. The apples dominate. Its like an alcoholic juice, its that well done. The honey adds such a depth to this its incredible. The mouth feel is a little light for Schramms. Its got a lingering alcohol on the back end, but this is just a damn good beverage.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

4134,"2016-09-30",4.0,"September 30, 2016. Bottle, received in a trade, thanks! 
Clear golden 
Aroma is fruity and floral with juicy apples, honey, some light spicy notes of cinnamon and vanilla, light touch of alcohol. 
Taste is sweet, fruity and very light spicy. Finish is sweet with honey and baked apples, some cinnamon, a touch of vanilla and notes of alcohol. Medium bodied, there is a very light fizzy small carbonation note. 
Very good, like a blend between ice cider and mead, without the fizzy small bubble carbonation it would have been ever better.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","hackobock"

4134,"2015-05-13",4.2,"pours clear bright golden with some serious legs, ice-cider looks. red apples with a hint of tartness, caramelized sugars, spices - cinnamon, clove; tarte tatin, floral and spicy honey, chalk. flat carbonation, medium-full body - oily; lightly astringent, sweet but never cloying woody-spicy honey finish. this would compete with killer blends of ice cider/mead. unique and quite exceptional offering.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
4134,"2015-05-08",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 9, 2015 Pours a clear golden with good legs. Nose is of honey, acetaldehyde, a little artificial but still pleasing. Taste is a little sweeter than moderate with some ripe apple flavors but mostly of sugary honey. Body is full and sticky and all the excess sugar gets tiring after a while. Overall I thought it was good at first but my appreciation quickly winded down afterward, Schramms produce some way better products than this. I need to sample a few more cysers to adjust my appreciation, maybe?","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
4134,"2015-05-07",4.1,"2 oz sample from bottle. Beautiful bright crystal clear gold pour. Aroma of honey, fairly subtly apple, definitely some green apple, apple pie, light minty notes, tons of honey obviously, but some liquory apple notes that remind me slightly of ice cider. Taste is sweet, sweet fruity apple, some spice, cinnamon most notably but also maybe a hint of clove. Palate is really nice, just enough warming alcohol, easily drinkable with a nice residual sweetness. Tasty stuff.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

4134,"2015-05-01",3.9,"2 oz from bottle (375 ml). Thanks to cparles for this one!

Appearance: Deep bright yellow-golden with some decent legs. 

Aroma: It has a deep sweet apples presence similar to some ice ciders but theres a rich honey presence. A tad boozy, but nothing overwhelming. Light cinnamon notes and hints of ginger.

Taste: Medium sweetness with caramelized apples, rich honey, moderate spiciness (cinnamon, ginger), warming alcohol and mild tartness. 

Palate: Medium body. A bit oily. Warming finish. Lingering apples and sweetness. 

Overall: Another tasty mead from Schramms. A lot of similarities with ice cider, which isnt bad at all. The apples and honey get along better than I thought it would. Could be a little more acidic and it would be easier to drink, but its already quite well balanced.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Turns out its NOT, thanks to Alyson for clearing that up for me :) Nice, golden body with only a few stray bubbles on top. Mostly clear. Aroma of fresh, green apples covered in sweet honey with a lightly vinous, white grape background character. Like walking through a honey soaked orchard.
