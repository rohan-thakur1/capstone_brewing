Dość wiotka i niezbyt okazała.
Drobne ziarenka tylko przez krótką chwilę utrzymują się na powierzchni.

W tle majaczy soczyste mango.
W oddali odrobina ciasteczek i słodów. 
 Smak:  W smaku początkowo słodowe z wyraźną chlebową i ciasteczkową bazą.
Po kilku łykach zaczyna dominować chmiel. Czuć wyraźnie wpływy amerykańskiej rewolucji piwnej.
Chmiele dają akcenty żywiczne, leśne, odrobinę ziemistych, ale przede wszystkim owocowe.
Dominuje mandarynka, pomarańcza, ananas, czy grejpfrut.

806,"2016-01-12",4.2,"7.5%ABV. Imperial IPA. 

Poured out a cloudy gold. 6ºSRM.

Nose has some subdued citrus freshness.

Mouthfeel is soapy. Carbonation is adequate. The palate is dominated by honey, mead, corn syrup, taffy, cotton candy, peach nectar, apricots, The palate is the thing that really sets this one apart with it being light, sugary, yet being hefty at the same time with some real malt backbone describing caramel, malted milkshakes and wheat bread. That palate of light sweetness and aggressive hops is unique!

Hops are pine, resin and sappy. Grassy and vegetal. Gentle hyssop and raw kale with some Brussel sprout.

The hop character is present all throughout the flavor curve. It really gives the overall impression of bitter-sweet . A very very nice ride, which if I didnt see the dogfish head logo on the label, wouldve had me scratching my head for a week trying to remember where Id tasted this one before. 90 minute IPA!!!

Pilsner beers are not my passion, but this certainly works nicely as an evolution of the style so...good job.","Barcelona, CATALONIA, ","Acid303"

806,"2015-08-02",4.5,"330 ml bottle bought at Sips in Sai Wan.
Looks: Cloudy hazy golden honey colour; One finger head with crumpety white foam which lasts for 2 minutes; Beautiful sticky lacing with barely notable, very slight carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant malt, with very strong fresh pineapple and jackfruits, passion fruits, canned peaches, grapefruits, floral, strong honey, molasses, pine, resin, light spices, lemon and strong fresh grass.

Taste: Medium sweet malt, with strong grapefruits, floral, strong molasses, moderate pine, quite strong resin, strong earth, spices, biscuits, lime, strong bitter hops and strong grass.

Body: Medium body. Very slick and oozy palate.

Mouth Feel: Very solid maltyness in a pretty rich body. 
Very good grapefruits-driven hops matches the sweetness evenly. Just right pine and resin ooze and they tasted pleasant enough. Saaz earthiness and spice also came through. Strong limey bitterness to round. Very balanced and tasty!

Hoppiness: Very fresh pineapple, jackfruits, passion fruits, peaches, floral, grapefruit, pine, resin, spices, lemon and fresh grass in nose. Strong grapefruits, lime, floral, pine resin, earth, spices in taste. Bitterness is moderate, strong enough to balance the sweetness for a lasting, fairly high astringent sweet-bitter finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Fruity sweet and nicely bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one really impresses with beautiful color, nice head and superb lacing, then comes very refreshing tropical fruits aroma, and ends with very solid body, malty sweetness, and well-manoeuvred hoppiness. It tasted really like a IPA when in fact its a IPL-themed Imperial Pils, I dont have much to complain about. Definitely a note above Jacks Abby Mass Rising. Excellent!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

806,"2015-01-21",3.7,"It pours from the bottle with a cloudy, muted, orange-yellow color and is topped by a giant, dense, foamy head. The aroma has a decent yeast presence, some dull, earthy/leafy hops, a little bit of bready sweetness, and a tiny hint of alcohol. The flavor has a nice contrast of dense, woodsy bitterness against a chewy, yeasty breadiness. The light carbonation allows a mouth-filling, resinous texture to develop.

806,"2014-05-04",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2014 Pours straw-color with 1 finger head. Very lager-like aside for the slight haze.

Still discernibly lager-like in aroma with a twist of citrus, lemon. Lager qualities lie in grain, floral and spicy notes. Also a hint of pine as it warms.

Taste reminds me of a pale ale version of Brewfists Spaceman with an added spicy, pils/saaz bitterness. Wonderfully smooth and creamy mouth-feel yet retains the light-feel of a thirst quenching lager. 

Unfortunately when it warms - like many lagers - it becomes almost undrinkable as the repugnant lager qualities emerge. Still, overall, a well re-imagined strong lager.","Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","jerd16"
806,"2014-05-02",3.6,"Golden in color, its clean and glassy-clear, with a frothy, bubbly bright white head. It has a really pleasant, clean, grainy hop-forward nose thats void of any unpleasant lager notes. A touch of light caramel malts also comes through a little. This beer is really fantastic. I actually think it tastes better than Dogfish Heads version. The mouthfeel is smooth and almost creamy, and the flavor is fantastic  an almost other-worldly fruit/alcohol/hop character rules the experience, and the slightly sweet, grainy flavors are superbly complimentary of that wickedly seductive hop bouquet. Simcoe, Warrior, and Saaz I would never have guessed for a pilsener. It finishes sweet and grainy, and overall reminds me more of a top-notch American pale ale than a pilsener. Im impressed.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Citrus, orange peel and some spices, the beer is quite hoppy for a lager and some pine and bitterness comes through early on. Malty base with faint biscuit & sweetness rounding things off.

Light, clear amber with a 0.5cm, creamy looking head that is a white & holds well, leaving some nice lacing and stopping short of going patchy on the surface.

Grassy hops with some citrus & pine with a malt base & some sweetness making an appearance alongside some biscuit & spice. Orange, pineapple & tropical fruits all come through as well.

Thicker than I expected, coming around just past medium bodied & it seems fairly well carbonated with a pleasant citrus tang and a crisp, dry finish. The alcohol content is very well hidden throughout with a sharp feel that goes down well.

Powerful grapefruit and herbal hops up front lead into a fairly light body of caramel and white bread malt. Spicy hops come through in the finish, and linger into the aftertaste.

mia prima imperial pils , ammettendo che questo termine abbia un reale significato.

I really enjoyed it.  The flavor found bitter orange peel and floral notes throughout, with a bit of related citrus sourness.. some pale and bready malts supported, but didnt play a major role.. finished with citrus sourness, some earthy yeast, and bitter floral notes.  Medium-bodied and quite sour and bitter on the palate.. very citrusy.. interesting stuff that Id gladly drink again (for much less than $11, though).","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
806,"2012-10-03",3.7,"In short: A pleasant semi-sweet, yeasty, fruity, slightly spicy blonde ale.  Good.
How: From a bottle at Mondial De La Bière 2012
The look: Cloudy yellow-blond body topped by a medium white head with medium retention
In long: Nose is bright with some kind of spiced mandarine cocktail over a bed of flowers, very aromatic stuff here.  Taste is like chewing on a mix bag of dried fruits (dried little orange cubes, dried slices of bananas, dried apricots, more), some coriander-ish and ginger-ish spiciness, honeyed hay, dusty yeast, grassy and floral hops.  Strong yeast presence.   Yellowed grass in the finish almost dry out the beer.  Pleasant big fluffy mouthfeel with a lively carbonation.  A bit too sweet for my dryness-seeking palate but I found it nonetheless enjoyable.  Got a generous 6oz sample and can easily imagine myself drinking a lot more of this.  Another beer I had at Mondial 2012, I was using all my lunch breaks from work every day to go to Mondial and drink beer instead of having lunch, but dont you dare calling people like me a drunk (us drunks really hate that).","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

A - Very nice amber/golden body. Slightly hazy with a large amount of carbonation rising from the etched glass bottom. Super fluffy 2 finger high white head that leaves a ton of lacing.

S - Very hop heavy. These hops smell very distinctively Dogfish Head. Tropical fruits and some light pine notes. This is followed by some subtle bready malts. 

T - Same as the nose. Tropical fruits, pine, and bready malts. There is a bit of grass and earthiness as well. Very bitter finish. Mouth feel is a bit on the light side, but sticky and oily.

O - Ive had the Delaware brewed version of this and I really dont detect too much of a difference. I am having a hard time distinguishing whether or not this is aged though. The hops are still very vibrant and there is a lot of fruitiness and bitterness, but this is balanced out by a great deal of mild malts. Overall a really nice collaboration.

806,"2010-01-13",3.3,"Draft at Redlight Redlight.  Pours a crystal clear, medium golden hue.  Effervescing bubbles stream towards the surface, pooling into a small, foamy, off-white head.  Solid sheets of micro-film lacing provide full coverage on the glass.  Aromas kick off with notes of sweet, clean cereal grain, hay, bread, and a hint of honey.  Softly grassy hops provide the counterpoint.  Flavors are a bit sweeter than I care for in a pils, no doubt due to the hefty grain, bread, and dough malt notes.  Though its hoppy, the grassy, lemony bitterness fails to catch up to the malty sweetness.  Accordingly, the palate is just a bit overly hefty, lacking the fresh crispness that I was hoping for. Pils is a style best left ""small"" in my opinion.  The ""imperial"" versions rarely live up to expectations, and this one is no exception.  Still, its a pretty decent brew, and they showed a little restraint in that they could have certainly beefed it up even more.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

806,"2009-12-20",3.0,"Very pale golden pour.  The nose is quite sweet with lots of sweet malt character.  A little bit of honey and herbal malt character as well.  Lightly grassy nose behind the sweetish malts.  It is very hoppy on the palate with a very assertive bitterness.  Its really kind of a mess.  Some nice aromatics but theyre clobbered by being too boozy, too bitter and just too much.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

That said, this was really good, bordering on awesome. Light and crisp, completely hiding its strength. Lots herbal, piney hops, and light, mildly corn flavored malt base. Very drinkable, very enjoyable.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"

Faint sweet malty backbone is just about detectable in the midst of all this hoppage but its just providing a back beat. Proper complex hoppage. The Saaz and Simcoe work really well together. Alcohol is hidden well and the nice dry bitterness in the finish makes it very drinkable indeed. Damn good stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

Dry, hoppy, restrained grassy and some lunaria - more IPA really than Pilsener. Fully hop-determined palate, but the finish releases some sweet malts. Medium bodied, typical gristslickness. Good, quite good even, but as said, this has the character of an IPA, rather than a Pilsener. The use of bottom fermenting, and a bit of Saaz wont change that.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
