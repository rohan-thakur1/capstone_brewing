3033,"2017-02-16",3.9,"Poured from a 750 ml, batch 2 bottle. 
Aroma is very malt forward with lots of caramel and toffee notes. Some light toasted bread wiht some burnt sugar notes. Some raisin, fig and date notes. Light oak and cognac character with some light alcohol notes. 
Pours a slightly murky brown with some auburn hues and a medium sized, thick, creamy tan head that exhibits really nice retention as it slowly recedes to a thin film that lingers on the edges. Moderate lacing and long legs. 
Flavor is very sweet with lots of malt and cognac notes. Layers of caramel with some toffee, toasted bread and brown sugar. Lots of grape notes, raisins, figs and dates. Some medium light oak notes and moderate cognac with moderate alcohol spice in the finish. Lingering cognac, caramel and sugar. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied and somewhat silky with moderate carbonation. Low astringency and moderate alcohol warmth. 
Overall, the beer is not as hot as I was expecting but its also way sweeter than I was expecting. Its bordering on sickly sweet and the cognac notes seem to accentuate it. More heat, but more sugar and less fruit as it warms.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3033,"2017-01-29",4.0,"Merci à Yan pour cette bouteille qui faisait lobjet dune longue convoitise de ma part. Robe couleur prune, presque violette.

On sent les vestige de lalcool français et malgré les 17% dalcool, cest le fruit séché qui domine. La persistance des saveurs en bouche est ce qui ma le plus étonné. Les saveurs sont courtes. La bière ne manque aucunement de corps pour autant, mais les saveurs meurent rapidement pour laisser place à un sucre infini qui enrobe mes joues après sêtre déposé sur mes lèvres.

3033,"2017-01-07",4.6,"A deal with the devil b2

Pours a dark ember red-brown colored beer, together with a slowly uprising bubbly, beige head, which then disappears all too soon. After swirling the beer, its thickness becomes obvious at the glass, revealing slick alcohol legs, reminding me of drinking a Whiskey. 

Complex on the nose, not defined by an overly present barrel though. A vivid, multi layered fruit note mingles perfectly into caramel malts, evoking dried plums, raisins, fermenting grapes and red apples. A toasty nut quality sets itself atop of the malts, soothed by a flowery note. Way lighter on the nose than its abv indicates, due to its awesome balance.

Drinks utmost silk, with a nice creaminess to it, complex and rich, creating a long lasting, awesomly well balanced firework on my palate, with a warming ending.

Tastes of a glazed caramel maltiness, spiced up by matured, gently bitter hops, creating a dried, sugared orange flavor. Ripe figs, dipped into bakers chocolate and wild honey, enriched by sweet cold pressed coffee get completed by a warming raisin, pepper and clove spiciness. Finishes soft, slighty oaken, with a jammy raspberry and juice grape fruitiness, coated by caramel. 

A wonderfull sipper. Its not at all over the top/boozy/hot as I expected it to be - instead this showcases an incedible, well nuanced depth of flavors and aromas, which beautifully respond to each other. Another highlight is its mouthfeel. Many Barleywines tend to have a thinner, unpleasant mouthfeel, this does certainly not. It is silk and soft, almost a little creamy, reminding me of having a warming scoop of caramel ice cream.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3033,"2014-06-20",4.7,"Poured into a wine glass at a Shelton Brothers tasting at the Wine and Cheese Place.
Aroma: Very aromatic, toffee, caramel, biscuit comes out as it warms up, boozey fumes if you get close enough.
Appearance: Pours a murky reddish brown with a small amount of tan foam, head dissipates fairly quickly, leaves a nice trail of suds on the glass as you sift it.
Taste: Sweet molasses, roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, toffee, booze; all of the flavors which were out on the nose come together for a big party. Theres so much going on from start to finish you keep discovering new flavors after numerous pulls.
Palate: Full bodied, one of the thickest beers I have ever had, very chewy, a dessert in a glass.
Overall: This is one of the finest barleywines I have ever had the pleasure to drink. I couldnt quite pull out any traces of the cognac barrels but I am sure it is probably hiding in there somewhere waiting for a more experienced palate. Be careful with this one, it will sneak up on you given how smooth it is!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","lricketts"

The beer looks like a muddy cola. Brownish gray and murky with an inch of thick, khaki hued cap. Not a very nice looking beer. However, every other aspect of the beer (all of the important attributes) is fantastic.

The aroma brings the cognac front and center. Additional notes of toffee, oak, booze, leather, brown sugar. Fabulous flavor, carrying every delectable whiff of the aroma into the taste. Rich and smooth. Delicate on the palate with a gentle, silky finish. 17.3% abv?!? Dangerously drinkable. Teeming with flavor, this is a beer to sip and savor. A top notch example of the style.

3033,"2013-03-26",4.8,"On tap at Brouwers 2013 Hard Liver Fest. Colour...golden amber with a whisp of an off white head. Nose...teeming with dark fruits, esp dark cherries, Zante currants, dark raisins and Brooks prunes, as well as various fruity boiled sweets. Palate... a delicate froth starts the journey, then the bowl of tropical fruit rolls in with Turkish delight, light toffee, and the Cognac. The booze is subtle,which is remarkable as this barley wine is 17.3% abv! Theres a pause of oakiness but it does not overpower, nor does it fully interrupt the afore mentioned flavours. This barley wine is a singularly superb accomplishment and could easily become THE benchmark for barley wine!","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"
3033,"2013-03-23",4.3,"On tap at Brouwers Hard Liver 2013. Really glad I got to try this one -- it was something else. Murky, muddy brown, with a tan head. Booze, caramel, some tart cherry, and gobs of brown sugar on the nose. Huge flavor that covers the 17% beautifully -- I really couldnt believe the abv was that high. So much malt in here -- the flavor just explodes with dark fruits (overripe cherries), molasses, some seafoam candy, maybe a bit of cacao -- unreal that this much complexity came from a single malt. Huge, and very, very tasty -- Im quite impressed!","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

Flavor is toffee/caramel, dark dried fruit mostly with some light bitterness and a very tame alcohol presence. Medium body with a mild, soft carbonation. Hard to believe this one is 17%, drinks like a 10% beer, really reminds me of smoother, cleaner, Tomas Hardy. I hope Gabe bottles this.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","savnac"
