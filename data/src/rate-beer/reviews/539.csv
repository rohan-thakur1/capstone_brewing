539,"2014-12-17",3.5,"Had on draft at blackstone. Poured in a tulip. No head. Aromas are all barrel. Flavor is similar. The barrel is very strong on this, but not in a deep, immersive way with things BA for a longer time. It's a bit abrasive, though not entirely disagreeable. The base beer fades a bit in with the barrel application, though it's still there and still good. I liked this, but the barrel does just seem a bit tacked on rather than a core component of the beer.","","Beardaxe"

Aroma is very bourbon barrel forward. Smooth booze with a huge vanillin barrel-aging component, lots of toffee, earth, & a slight tannic wood presence in the finish. The barrel has certainly dominated this beer, but its surprisingly not overbearing. Taste has more of that smooth bourbon with a strong vanilla underbody; more toffee, caramel, & faint earthiness make a more suitable base. The finish has slight notes of orange peel & bitter pine tree, perhaps the only notable component of the original Reds to peak through.

539,"2009-03-29",4.1,"Draft @ Founders:  Pour was a deep bronze color with almost no head. The nose on this is so ridiculously complex...notes of tropical fruits, coconut, vanilla, rye malt and some woodsiness all make themselves apparent in a big way.  Body was slick, silky yet still retained a dryness.  Flavor was equally as complex, starts relatively sweet and fruity with noticeable barrel compliments and finishes on a dry rye malt note.  Very good brew.","Ft Wayne, Indiana, USA","bdigital"
539,"2009-02-21",4.0,"Draft sample @ MBGSF 08.  Pours a slightly hazy reddish brown color with a small beige head.  The aroma had fruity/citrus, spices, caramel malt, vanilla, wood, and light bourbon.  The flavor had an apricot fruitiness, moderately sweet caramel, rye, spices, wood, vanilla, and light bourbon.  The finish had a nice bitterness.  I enjoyed this one, but I am a big fan of the regular Reds Rye as well.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
539,"2008-12-30",4.1,"On tap at founders.  Hazy dark red with small beige head.  Aroma with fresh red fruit and drier malt, some orange and grapefruit as well, only subtle barrel.  Flavor is bitter grains and red fruit with some barrel, mostly tanic bitterness, dry but sweet and not cloying in the least, some overripe fruit, very tasty.  Medium, well carbonated body.  Very well balanced and all around very well done.","Grand Rapids/Chicago, Michigan, USA","xnoxhatex"
539,"2008-08-29",3.8,"tap at founders.  first visit to the new brewpub and first stop on our way up to mackinaw, mi.... semi-opaque, dark redddish caramel brown pour with a circular film of a soapy white ring around the edges.... aroma of vanilla and light bourbon notes, wood, as well as some spicy and peppery rye.... flavor maintained the essence of red’s with its spicy rye notes and some lingering hop bitterness combined wit sweet vanilla, bourbon, and wood.  not overly barrel-aged which was nice and would gladly have again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
539,"2008-08-15",4.0,"On tap at the brewery: Pours brown with little head.  Aroma of hops, spices and bourbon (which you can barely taste).  Very good.","Byron Center, Michigan, USA","Hudspart"
539,"2008-08-12",3.8,"Great Taste 2008. After drinking a lot of the regular, then trying the charred, I now had the chance to taste the BA. Strangely enough, I think the others are better. This was a solid with the great notes of spice and the wonderful color I’ve come to appreciate so much about Red’s Rye. Notes of butter, orange peel, and nutmeg contributed. However I thought the barrel distracted from some of the complexity, not because the barrel ageing overwhelmed the beer, but simply because I found it a bit distracting. The hops were a lit out of sync with the barrel.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
539,"2008-08-12",3.9,"Draft sample at MBGF Summer08. Poured a dark brown color with a moderate frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy roasted, citrus hop and woody aroma. Medium  to full body. Medium to heavy bittersweet flavor with a  medium bittersweet tingly finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
539,"2008-08-04",4.0,"On tap at brewery.  Aroma of citrus hops, caramel, spice, and bourbon.  Deep dark amber hue with a nice average sized off-white head that mostly diminished and left little lace.  Flavor is resin pine hops, caramel, bourbon, oak, and a little spice.  Palate is medium body and soft.  A pretty good bourbon brew.  Should try again.","Saginaw, Michigan, USA","polomagnifico"
539,"2008-08-04",3.8,"On tap at Founders. Murky orange-brown body, thin off-white head. Sharp nose with potent bourbon, oak, sweet, caramely malt, toast, and citrusy hops. Boozy and dessert-like. The body bowled me over with bourbon and buttery oak, the bourbon overwhelming the Red’s Rye characteristics. In fact, this beer tasted like a shot of bourbon with some lingering, residual hops and toasty malts added as flavoring. This would be excellent if the oak was toned down, and if there was a stronger fresh hops component.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
539,"2008-08-03",4.0,"Wonderful nose of oak, vanilla, bourbon, caramel malts emanating from this pour, crimson and oily looking.  The hop hit of the original Red’s is really mellowed out here, layered under the big sticky sweet caramel malt, tannins, bourbon, and vanilla, that barrel aging created.  Brilliant!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
539,"2008-07-31",4.0,"On tap at Founders.  Differs from the Charred Reds in that this is Barrel Aged, whereas the Charred used oak chips and bourbon-additive..dark amber body, almost brown with nice head..aroma of subtle oak, pine, caramel, and bitter hops..flavor is also slightly tannic, with more subtle, toned-down piney hops than the original Reds Rye..nicely floral finish, and very appetizing...","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","badnewsbeers"
539,"2008-07-30",4.2,"2008 MiBGF: Slightly hazed crimson hue and a very good head and lace. The aroma has notes of dry-hopped pine and catty hops, rye, caramel, oak and vanilla, and a earthy yeast vapour. The taste is driven by a forward rye snap and layered with caramel malt. The finish is where the bourbon barrel shows it’s colors, vanilla, booze, and spice. There is even a hint of mint in there. The mouth feel is aggressive and biting yet uniquely drinkable. OUTSTANDING and the best beer of day 1.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
539,"2008-07-28",4.0,"Served at the MBG summer fest 08.  I love normal reds rye, and I actually expected this to take a step down, as barrel aged IPAs arent normally my thing.  Still had a big citrus smack on the nose, but a hint of something else mixed in.  Flavor was much the same, but the wood actually worked well with the beer which was very surprising.  Added just a bit of complexity.  Great grapefruit punch at the end, nice rye and tasty malt.  This was a fun beer.","Holt, Michigan, USA","masonjer"
