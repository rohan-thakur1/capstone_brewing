1072,"2016-12-20",3.7,"Pours crystal clear with a light coppery-gold coloration - no head. Aroma is a mild, almost apple, cidery aroma. Taste is initially mild and semi-sweet with pear skin sneaking in for the mid. Theres a little acidic flavor for the finish before it washes away. As this is my first perry, Im not real sure what to expect entirely. Regardless, this is refreshing and elegant - it would probably pair well with Sinatra.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","S_Side_Smitty"

1072,"2012-10-07",3.0,"375 mL bottle: Nearly colorless liquid splashed with yellow. Noisy, dying head. Waxy, perfumey aromas on elegant display, with hints of mushroom, lime zest, fresh cut pineapple, artichoke and uncured hay. Pleasingly musty but not overly wild or rustic. Hugely effervescent and gassy mouthfeel. Prickly lime zest and pineapple acids very gently buckle the cheeks before converging with a pronounced vitaminlike dullness. Pear skin offers a snappiness which coincides nicely with the bracing dryness. Adequate level of residuals keep things from becoming stark, though the absence of phenols causes things to be two-dimensional.  Pear character is not particularly ripe or explosive either, which reinforces the yearning for greater depth and vibrancy. Closes with a peppery, zesty dryness laced with succulent pear juice remnants and a healthy dose of musty minerals.  The framework is definitely here, but ultimately it comes across as a bit too ""simple"". And there is also an unpleasant moldy/uncured hay character that is somewhat off-putting. Those folks looking for something bretty and barnyardy, might want to look elsewhere. Just okay.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

1072,"2010-11-26",3.6,"2007 Cork Date; Sampled November 2010
Pours into my Lost Abbey Teku glass with a frothy, quickly dissapearing, pale white head. The Perry is a pale-gold hue (looks like a white wine). Smells of very fresh pears with a definite floral aspect and a mix of sweet and tart.

Bracingly cold and fizzy, this is definitely sweet, but not aggressively so (which is good). The pear flavor is not quite as expressive as it was in the nose, but is still quite floral, quite fruity and with a nice, even, soft acidity. The perry finishes with a carbonic acid bite and an at times wine like floral character; said more truthfully though it is a white-wine that sometimes finishes with a pear note. Texture is quite nice as it is very light and prickly from the expressive carbonation. As this warms there is almost a butter-poached pear like thing going on here. As it warms some mineral character starts to become more noticeable in the finish and it even seems to pick up a touch more body.

This is definitely nice, definitely enjoyable, though my wife thinks it would be better if it was even more dry. I dont know though, the bit of sweetness that is here helps to accentuate the pear flavors quite well, though it still doesnt quite get to the level of the expressive nose. For some reason I really want to try a spontaneously fermented Perry now, a bit of funk here would work really well.  I really wish I could better describe Ciders and Perry, I am definitely lacking in my palates ability to dissect these two drinks.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Flavor is a lot softer than the aroma suggested- juicy pears, lightly bitter skins, mild musty earth (or bark), and finishing very dry with some acidic, lightly tart pear candy.

1072,"2007-09-04",3.4,"(bottle, thanks akevitt) Pours a cloudy pale with a large white head that extinguishes quickly.  Aroma is tart and sour with some funk.  Taste is initially tart at first but rounds out to a nice mellow pear sweetness.  {Use caution upon opening}","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
1072,"2007-09-04",4.1,"thanks to akevitt for sharing.  Faint pear and an almost lambic like barnyard funk to to the aroma.  Lemonade like color.  Champagne like mouthfeel with an expetionally earthy flavor with some of the best pear flavor Ive had in a beverage.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
1072,"2007-09-04",4.0,"Really?  28th percentile.  This was unusual and very enjoyable.  Seeing it is from Rouen reminds me of my time in that city, the Cathedral,the interesting architecture, Jeanne dArc.  Anyway.  This cider has an interesting white color and lots of sediment.  Very heavily carbonated, and sediment, I imagine little pieces of pear.  Light aroma of the countryside.  Great flavor, quite sweet but not cloying, some barnyard, but this is very light.  Interesting appearance, some complexity, this is a good product.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1072,"2007-09-03",3.5,"UPDATED: JUL 16, 2008 [Bottle, thanks akevitt] Pours a cloudy very pale color with a large white head that quickly diminishes.  Aroma is a little sour.  Taste is sweet, quite carbonated, then strongly of pear in the finish.  Pretty long finish.  Medium thickness.  Nice, but not outstanding.  Also, the cork blasting comments in other reviews are accurate, this was opened outside and the cork shot highly into the tree we were under.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"
1072,"2007-09-02",1.9,"I looks like my wife opened a can of pears for my boys, pour the juice in a glass and served it to me.  Sort of sweet nose.  I took a dri nk and instantly hated it.  The carbonation attacked and I couldnt handel it.  Pour it out.  Yuck.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
1072,"2007-09-01",2.6,"Fourth cider (first Perry) of the night at the Indra - Cider, Sake and Mead tasting 8/31/07.  Appearance looks like cloudy pear juice with a bunch of lingering carbonation.  Very pulpy in appearance.  Aroma is sugary pear.  Taste is certainly pear, with noticeably less body than an apple cider.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
1072,"2007-08-05",2.1,"This corked and caged bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a medium sized head of all foam white colored medium sized bubbles that were very quickly diminishing to nothing and left behind a transparent strongly carbonated very light yellow-white colored body almost clear.  Strong bubbly carbonation in the nose. The crisp dry sour mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a bubbly carbonated aftertaste. The flavor contained mild notes of crisp thin watery pear and lambic like. An OK brew just nothing special.  Overly carbonated.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1072,"2007-06-13",3.6,"750 ml bottle.  The previous writers are absolutely correct, the cork literally blasts off the bottle as soon as the cage is loosened. Made a nice ding in my kitchen ceiling!  Pours a very slightly cloudy light hay with lots of champagne-type bubbles rising to the surface.  Light but pleasant aroma of pears and yeast. The flavor is light and delicate with notes of pear and yeast.  Slightly acidic, with a dry finsh.  Fruity without being sweet.  My wife and I enjoyed this quite a bit.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
1072,"2006-10-18",3.4,"The cork explodes out of the bottle. Pours crystal clear with a slight golden hay hew and a head the fades within a second. Extremely effervesent. Aroma is sweet pear, mild soft cheese, and champange. Flavor is of sweet and tart pear, some apple, some funky soft cheese, and a very mild vinegary champagne. Starts sweet, becomes tart, then drys out but not completely on the finish. After taste is a milder lingering mix of the previous tastes and lasts longer then I expected. This is my first perry/pear cider.","Silver Spring, Maryland, USA","jeffin7"
1072,"2006-08-26",3.4,"750 ml bottle from Bello Vino in Ann Arbor, MI (August 2006), sampled at cellar temperature in a Christoffel glass.  The cork pops the cage off before Ive finished loosening it.....the contents disgorge into the glass with furious bubbling action and a continually reviving small fizzy white head, worlds of yeast revolving in the pale yellow liquid....fresh, very light apple/pear, champagne-hued aroa with faint earthy/farmy notes in the light but pretty aroma....on the tongue, exceedingly light, mineralic, fresh-fruity and moderately sweet to start, heading into moderately dry at the finish, a touch syrupy, with prickly strong carbonation.  This is probably as good as a light, crisp low-grav perry is going to be, not extraordinarily memorable or intense but easy to quaff and lacking in any really flaws.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1072,"2006-07-24",0.9,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2006 Pallid yellow with an explosive head and a champagne persona (use caution when opening as others have mentioned). Hellishly awful aroma that did not improve over time... sulfrous yeasts with only minor notes of pear. Fluffy, metallic mouthfeel with a sulfuric, eggy flavor and a sour fruitiness. Gassy palate with an acidic, gut-rot finish. Quite near vomit-inducing. My wife couldnt drink it with her nose pinched and asked frankly, ""How much did we pay for this shit?"" At our little tasting, ""Drouin Poire"" translated directly to ""Drain Pour"".

1072,"2006-07-19",3.5,"Cloudy pale yellowish white w/ a large, cobweb-like white head. Extremely well-carbonated. Acidic lemony aroma w/ sweet notes of pear & tart green apple.

1072,"2006-07-14",3.0,"Musty apple nose, hazy yellow, good sized white head. Lemonish flavour, pleasantly sweet. Very nice. Thank You tupalev.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DougShoemaker"
1072,"2006-06-27",3.5,"Bottle shared with a bunch of folks at Dougs - courtesy of tupalev. Bottle absolutely exploded open when the wire was removed from the cork - crazy! Hazy greenish-yellow colour, tons of carbonation. Slightly funky aroma of tart pear and green apple. Flavour is crisp and dry, both tart and sweet - very interesting. I quite liked it.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
1072,"2006-06-26",3.1,"Bottle. GUSHER! Pours a hazy whitish body with a quick medium white head. The aroma is quite nice - pears, apple, and a nice mingling of sweet and sour. The sparkling body is very refreshing, fruity, and reasonably tasty. I could drink this stuff quite easily in the summer months. Good.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"
1072,"2006-06-18",3.4,"Item #7 at June 2006 Toronto cider/mead -fest - bottle from tupalev.  Well, it gushed forcefully on an unsuspecting tupalev, but plenty left in the bottle to share around - poured hazy pale yellow with a huge white foaming head.  Aroma of not-quite-ripe pear and green apple, sparkling wine.  Taste of unripe pear, rhubarb, sparkling wine - manages to be both tart and sweet simultaneously.  Solid sparlkling body, acidic and refreshing - elegant; if this sucker was infected (doubtful) I dont care - I really liked it!  Big thanks out to tupalev for bringing it!","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
1072,"2006-06-18",3.3,"My bottle from Premier in Buffalo, held in my cellar for 4 months prior to our tasting held at Dougs.  Man, I wish I had read the previous ratings, this sucker took off on the last twist of the wire and almost took my head off.  Im serious!  Anyway, when we did sample it (as there was still 500ml left in the bottle), it was a hazy lemonade looking white.  Decent pear/fruit aroma.  Nice very carbonated champagne like body, with lots of pear in the taste.  Light, simple, but enjoyable.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
1072,"2006-06-18",3.3,"Cork pops forcefully and it explodes all over the kitchen floor, the geyser of perry a view second only to the look on Tupalevs face. Hazy pale pastel yellow with a big bubbly head that fades quickly. Light fruity aroma with notes of pear. Touch of sour acidity in the flavour is prominent. Infected or intentional it is interesting regardless and rather refreshing. Average palate is quite efferevescent. Enjoyable.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
1072,"2006-05-30",2.8,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2014 Bottle. Head is initially small, fizzy, white, fully diminishing. Body is virtually colorless (hint of yellow), bottle conditioned. Aroma is light notes of apple/pear, lime, and SweetTarts candy. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Light body, watery texture, fizzy carbonation. A very fizzy and somewhat simple rendition. Not unpleasant though.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1072,"2006-05-30",1.4,"Holy shit! This smells bloody awful! I mean, claw your nose off and put it in your pocket until it passes awful! Ugh! For the record, heres the break down: clear pale yellow-greenalmost whitein color, small, frothy, quickly and totally diminishing head. The aroma is heavy permanent wave solution, moderate skunk flatulence and plastic, light aluminum can. The flavor is moderately-to-heavily sweet, lightly bitter, lightly acidic with a short, light-to-moderately acidic, lightly sweet finish. The body is light, the texture is watery and the carbonation is beyond fizzy.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","luckygirl"
1072,"2006-01-31",3.3,"Woo!  Bottle bomb!  After letting the thing fizz itself out I proceeded to taste.  The pear  is light and fizzy with just the slighest hint of sourness and a bit of earth.  I dont really go for the really fizzy stuff, so while I liked the flavor, the insane carbonation detracted for me.","Pennsylvania, USA","Probiere"
1072,"2005-12-07",3.5,"I didnt even finish untwisting the wire before the cork was launched from the bottle, the ensuing eruption causing me to be left with somewhat under 500ml of the 750ml bottle.  Fun pour, the pale yellow, almost Belgian Wit colored body thriving with tiny bubbles supporting a bubbly, fizzy white head.  That fades rapidly, but the bubbles continue to spring into the air, tickling your nostrils as you drink.  The aroma is of pear skin rather than pear flesh, slightly metallic to the nose.  This cider continues to fizz up in the mouth and all the way down to the gullet, a challenge to even the best of burpers.  The flavor is tart, almost lemony, an underlying pear taste giving it a subtle sweetness.  The finish is quite dry, followed by a resounding Burrrrrupp!<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?
