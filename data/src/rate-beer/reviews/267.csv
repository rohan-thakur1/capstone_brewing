267,"2015-08-30",3.4,"18.08.2015, 0,3l bottle @ UDON, Barcelona:
Small fizzy shortlasting head, completely clear and colorless. Aroma is fresh with a mild fermented rice touch, followed by mild sweetened lemon soda. Taste is fresh citrusy, like a mild lemon soft drink, with a mild touch of fermented rice. Light and fresh mouthfeel. Very refreshing and drinkable.","Loddefjord, NORWAY","Inbreak"
267,"2015-07-22",2.2,"Bottle. Pours a very very light gold with a faint, quick dissipating head. Nose is pear and stone fruit with an underlying mushroom earthiness. Very fruity and sweet on the tongue; theres very little true sake flavor underneath. More than anything, its prosecco or moscato, though perhaps with a little THA; it may be brewed traditionally, but the flavor veers so far from sake that I cant call the result traditional. Finish remains short, sweet, and fruity. As a sake, its a disappointment.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"

267,"2014-12-03",2.6,"The carbo was a bit too much but still ok. Aromas of pineapples and lemons. Quite sweet sour taste with too much pineapple in the taste. Not sure about that one.","Wanne-Eickel, GERMANY","MichaelAwesome"
267,"2014-12-03",2.5,"Sake from Dae Yang in Düsseldorf. It has got a clear, light vanilla colour with a medium to thin body. Aroma of rice and flowers. Taste of scented rice, flowers and sugary vanilla. Thin finish. Lacks certainly some alcohol for a better taste.","Reutlingen, GERMANY","McTapps"
267,"2014-08-17",2.0,"300ml blue bottle bought at Shin Tai Ho (HK)s booth at HKCEC in Wan Chai during HKTDC Food Expo 2014.
Clear, near colourless very pale pear juice colour; Less than one-quarter finger head with soapy white foams which fades in 5 seconds; Small sticky lacing with fizzy carbonation; Fragrant and sweet aroma of glutinous rice wine, with strong pear fresh and juice, pollen, sugar, and light alcohol; Medium to strong sweet taste of sparkling wine, with light sake rice, light apple juice, strong molasses, strong carbo, and faint alcohol; Light body. Slightly thick and slick palate; Mouth feel is thick and very sweet body with lots of carbo. Sake rice character faded into the background. Apple juice ester is almost Cider-like, which blended well with the thick and non-cloying molasses. The hidden 5% booze makes this pretty much an alco-pop Slightly dry after taste; Sweet and thick to mouth.

Comments: So, todays traditional sake brewers now has to tap into non-drinking population to survive, and this is a fine example - alco-pop like, with strong carbo, thick body, sweet cidery taste with hidden low booze. Good for partying, but poor as a Junmai. I am glad I got this as a HK$1 Facebook promotional bargain as I will not buy it again.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"
