3054,"2016-04-08",4.5,"Dark brown pour. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

Borderline world class very complex nose of charred oak, candied dark fruit (plum, raisin), bourbon, light notes of tobacco and leather, caramel and prune over a slightly sweet malt base.

Medium body with a smooth texture that has some creaminess. Superb carbonation that is well balanced with the body providing a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.

The flavor profile is borderline world class, especially for 12.5% ABV. Survive the onslaught of the first few sips and you will be in for quite a treat after your palate normalizes. Alcohol astringency is very well covered with just a bit emerging in the finish. Balance is world class, for a beer of this strength and it is a brewing masterpiece. A lot goes on in this complex beer, yet each element has its moment on the stage. Bourbon never leaves the palate but ebbs and flows allowing others to pop to the surface. A sweet bourbon leads off then flows into caramel by the middle. Here the other flavors of the nose arrive in roughly the following order: tobacco and leather, oak - which lingers, dark fruits and finally prune. The finish delivers a final crescendo of rich caramel that ebbs as bourbon lingers in the remarkable slightly dry finish. A little heat at the back of the throat, but far less than typical for an ale of this strength.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

Aroma is complex with loads of figs and dark fruits along tobacco, roasted malts, bourbon, vanilla, oak, alcohol and molasses. Taste is moderately acidic so it probably mean that theres something wrong going on in there but its probably an early phase since theres still residual sugars. Theres the same dried fruits and molasses presence than in the aroma with the booze being more present and the bourbon/vanilla/oak trio also being upfront. Medium body. Dead flat.

OCZY : piwo jest mętne o ciemnobrązowym kolorze. Piana jest malutka i szybko znika. 

NOS : od razu wyczuwam nuty podobne do whisky czy bourbon. Do tego czekolada i bakalie. Czekolada i whisky są tak intensywne, że przypominają czekoladkę nadzianą alkoholem. Niesamowicie przyjemny i głęboki aromat. 

USTA : brak nasycenia. Piwo jest tłuste i mocno gęste. 
Smak jest bardzo intensywny i kolonizuje wszystkie kubki smakowe. Słodki o nutach czekolady, suszonych fig, śliwek i orzechów. Do tego alkohol rozgrzewa i szczypie. Nie da się zrobić dużego łyka. Trzeba go powoli siorpać bo nie da rady inaczej. Ogólnie dominuje whisky.

3054,"2014-12-27",4.5,"12.7 oz, corked and caged, 12.5% abv, vintage 2014A. This is somewhat of an oddity in that I had an upgraded version on tap in Colorado some years ago, and am only now wrapping back around to the original. Nose is heavy brandy with a little port, oily even in the nose, tons of barrel character overwhelming just about everything else, but man is it good! [If there is a serious flaw here, its the way overstayed time in barrels, which could mask delicate nuance or even a bad recipe.  I guess that is its calling card, though, its reason for being, and its a good one.] Caramel and vanilla, spirited booze. Pours tawny but ends up essentially black in the glass at full volume, briefest of heads. Taste sweet with caramel, toffee, strong and very punchy red fruit, firm fruit esters, wood/oak barrel character, brandy, vanilla, light toast and excellent rounding tannins sugary alcohol and gentle burning fusels. Full body oily, boozy, but not obese or undrinkable; its heavy but not the heaviest Ive had this year ... seems to have earned the stature somehow. Very malty.  There are some wonderful unfurling notes of tobacco leaf, and rum-raisin sugars before and after the flambé. Light-medium bitterness and a touch of yeast deep under the alcohol. Smooth and superb sipper, really exemplary traditional barleywine flavors married to strong, complex brandy/port overtones from the long barrel aging; its worth showing to someone to demonstrate just how varied beer can be, and its worth the high price point if you get to take the bottle home and enjoy it all by yourself.Just so much here!

Beautiful malt, great barrel aging, but still bit of harshness to the sip after ~5+ years.

3054,"2014-01-05",4.0,"375 ml bottle, 2008 vintage, gifted to me by OldMrCrow -- thanks! After struggling with the cork, it eventually released with a nice, resounding ""pop,"" and the contents poured complete with bubbles into a tulip. I won the carbonation lottery on this one! Clear, dark brown pour with half a finger of offwhite head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is pretty big on soy sauce, raisin, oxidation, but still maintains some of its former identity with notes of caramel, plum, and toffee. Taste: soy sauce and raisin, cola, moderately sweet. Full body, lovely texture, nice, soft carbonation. Overall: Ive had this beer fresh once or twice before, but neglected to rate it because I was sure Id drink it again and again (and also because I was probably too drunk to put down any coherent notes). Deliverance is one of my all time favorites, and one of these nights I should have a small tasting with Serpents Stout, Angels Share, and Deliverance. At any rate, Im going to be a bit generous with the rating here, based on past experiences and what I recall. Next time I have this Ill be sure to append the rating and do a proper averaging. It was great to try this one with some serious age on it, but based on this Id say 6 years is a bit long for this one. Based on this bottle alone: 7/4/7/4/15 = 3.7.

2013 bottle, 12,5 % ABV


Look: Pours with large 2 thumb thick brown, creamy, slightly reddish foam. Medium retention, some of the foam forms a compact thin layer on the top for the whole ride. Carbonation visible. Color is dark brown/black, murky, cant see through, some yeast visible. Pours with thick/syrupy body, fair amount of lacing.


Smell: Dark, burned caramel, dark/milk chocolate, bourbon, oak, then some sweetness, dark fruit, raisins, vanilla. Holy shit intense - filled the room the second it was opened. Rich, oily, hint of coconut, fat overall. 


Taste: Bourbon, oak, vanilla. Rich complex sweet taste of different types of chocolate, burned caramel. Fat play between bourbon and rich malt character - lovely. Aftertaste consists of malty bitterness and bourbon, maybe slightly sour. Cant detect any hop flavour/aroma. Theres some alcohol in finish. 


Mouthfeel: Full, creamy. Med-low carbonation - expected for such a fat boy. There is some warming from the alcohol.

3054,"2013-04-07",4.2,"October 28th, 2011 - I have a vague memory of enjoying Angels Share long, long ago, before I put any of my reviews and scribbling onto Ratebeer. It was introduced as an example of the paragon of brewing. I tasted it, and immediately recognized it for what it was: a foil. Lost Abbeys Angels Share is everything that everyday beer isnt. If this is one path of evolution for beer, it begs the question of what other evolutionary branches might exist. The Angels Share drinker becomes a craft beer drinker at the instant of the taste. Thats a profound beer. In October, 2011 I had the opportunity to shake hands with this old friend again. The aroma is thick and almost oily, intensely perfumed with fig and concentrated raisin. The caramelized, bubbling sugar of a roasted sweet potato is also present, and laced (or barbed) with the sharpness of copious booze. The taste re-affirms the oiliness of this brew, cut nicely by the assertive alcohol level, like a sharks fin across the oceans surface. Intense, dry, and like a barley wine, Im drunk on both the flavor and beer after only half a glass. The dry character is contrasted against a caramel bourbon burn and residual sweetness, verifying Lost Abbeys proud barrel aging process. One danger present with these kinds of beers is a cloying intensity. I appreciate heavy flavored beers, but even heavy-weights can be too heavy. The beauty of the craft is to nuzzle that line as closely as possible without overstepping it, and I would argue that the Angels Share does that with a certain ballet-like grace. Where most beers strain to straddle that line, Angels Share dances up to it, balancing intensity and balance - a true craft brewing feat. Now, I wonder what this would taste like after a little aging...","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

No head what so ever indicates that the carbonation is most likely long gone John, but the beer itself is a deep dark dark brown thing - impossible to look through. The aroma however is most definitely not disappointing: it has lots of sweet caramel, dark sticky glazed fruits, a somewhat strange acidic lactal touch that I guess comes from the barrels, some licorice, dark acidic wood and just all in all its quite a interesting and nice aroma, but Im a bit more concerned now regarding the taste. Its time to taste the thing! Oh no.. Clearly off :( Oh my thats a big big bummer. Acetone and a sourness that just screams I-N-F-E-C-T-E-D. No, oh my thats a shame indeed.

3054,"2012-12-22",4.3,"Tämä viskihöyryistä nimensä saanut olut on väriltään tumman ruskea ja erittäin samea. Sen vaahto on niukka ja vaalean beige. Tuoksussa selkeintä on bourbon. Sen lisäksi löytyy vaniljaa (bourbon), rusinaa, soijakastiketta, kaakaota, viljaista mallasta ja siirappia. Alun bourbon hyökyaallon jälkeen tuoksusta tosiaan löytyy monenmoista. Tosin kaakaon löytämiseen pitää jo käyttää hieman mielikuvitusta. Makukin on ensituntumalta makea ja bourbonmainen.

A vigorous pour produces a viscous black liquid with a handful of bubbles that dissipate almost instantly. Smells of oaky vanilla with a boozy edge. Hints of chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, dark fruit and tobacco round out the nose quite nicely. The flavor is sweet like an aged barleywine. Sweet sugar and caramel mixed with some vinous notes. A touch of ethanol and a nice flavor of dark fruits, grapes, chocolate, and tobacco. Medium to thick body with a sweet syrupy mouthfeel and not a lick of carbonation. Ive sat on this bottle for quite some time fearing the disappointment that would ensue with the inevitable flat bottle.

3054,"2012-03-12",3.1,"From notes.  First reviewed 9/228/2011.  Poured from a 350 mL bottle into a tulip. Thanks to bauermj for bringing this over.

This has a dark brown hue with light brown edges. It is obviously totally flat, no head or carbonation.

The aroma is full of brandy. Nice red grape, molasses, caramel, and smooth malt notes are present in the nose as well.

Since it is flat, the flavors blend a bit too much together and lose their identity. Molasses and caramel provide the malt sweetness. Brandy and some dark fruits add some further depth.

The fact that it is totally flat brings this down quite a bit. Thick and syrupy, with a fair amount of stickiness. Some burning in the throat from the brandy.

I personally think of it more a an American Strong Ale as it has some Stout like tastes to me. Pours a dark murky brown with an off white head, when present.

At this point I will now tell anyone who ever asks my opinion of Lost Abbeys beers that they are an over rated waste of money and should be avoided like the plague. Its asinine that they have not corrected this problem. A real brewer (a good brewer) does some quality control and when problems like this continue to surface they take measures to correct the problem. NEVER EVER AGAIN.

3054,"2012-01-17",3.8,"2009 vintage 375 ml bottle. This pours a muddy, reddish chestnut brown color and barely topped by a few scant bubbles at the head that quickly rejoin the body below leaving a sudsy wash behind. Just no carbonation at all, which is a bit disappointing for sure. The aroma is very boozy, but deeper notes reveal caramel, toffee, chocolate, and dark fruits. The brandy barrel lends a distinct sweetness while offering loads of oak laden vanilla. The flavor follows suit with the caramel and toffee playing a huge part along with ample amounts of stewed dark fruits and vanilla from the oak. The brandy barrel lends its signature fruity sweetness well. There isnt much in the way of hops to balance out all the malt sweetness though. Nearly full bodied, but the palate lacks some due to the lack of carbonation, which doesnt help in covering up the sticky sugars. The finish is long, fruity, and boozy. This is certainly a very good beer, but one that is hindered due to no carbonation. I do enjoy the bourbon barrel version quite a bit more though. Ill definitely rerate if I come across a carbonated bottle.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

3054,"2011-11-03",2.8,"12.7 ounce (375 ml) caged and corked bottle, 2010 vintage as stamped on bottle.  Served in a snifter, the beer pours a murky brown color with no head and no lacing at all.  The cork was on the bottle tight, but once I got it out and there was no ""pop"", I figured this would be a flat bottle.  The brew smells like dark fruit, brandy, molasses and caramel.  The taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also a red grape and a bit of a weird tart fruit flavor.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a little slick with pretty much no carbonation.  Im lucky I didnt get a totally infected bottle of this, it could have been a lot worse.  This wasnt an awful beer, but it wasnt really enjoyable either.  Id like to try a good bottle of this brew at some point in the future, but thats not going to happen anytime soon after drinking this one.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
3054,"2011-10-30",3.9,"375 ml. bottle. 12.5% ABV. No year on the label. Pours a minimal, fizzy beige head, of short duration, over a brown (SRM 30) hazy, with occasional small floaters, body....nose is dried fruits, including fig, cherry, raisin, Marmite, beef, molasses....taste is sweet with brown sugar tones, slight molasses, balanced by dried fruits, Marmite, beef, soy, whiskey, vanilla.....mouth feel light, slightly sticky, alcohol hidden, carbonation low. The mouth feel is surprisingly light for a Barley Wine. The complexity of both aroma and flavor in this are absolutely outstanding. It is a remarkable balance of an Abt/Quad and a Barley Wine, tending towards the former. That may be due to age, as the hop backbone may be beyond its prime (I think this is a 2008), but the other forces make this a great beer. BJCP 8/3/16/4/8","Salida, Colorado, USA","drjay44"

What I am sure of is that it was one of the best beers Ive had in the past number of years.  Dark brown colour, thick head.  The aroma was impeccable - like a rumbutter-drizzled sticky toffee pudding with walnuts and awesomeness.  Simply the best aroma Ive encountered in a long time.  On the palate, this was unfathomably complex with rich, rich sugars both burnt and unburnt, subtle fruitiness, graham cracker crust and highland whisky. Almost a charcoal accent, like the char on a barbequed steak.  Rich - lots of malts with chocolate, walnuts, cashews, vanilla and deep fruitiness that veers into tartness late, resulting in a compelling  malt-fruit-alcohol combination.  Bombastic ale, very warming, with sugars, malts, raisins, date sugar, orange peel.  I think you could find almost anything in this beer, it has so much complexity and nuance.  Unreal depth.  Ive had Angels Share before, but this glass (correction, these glasses) were beer at its apex.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

Flavor falls apart quick.  Some merlot spiked with roasted/toasted malt that morphs into an unbalanced sour bomb.  Astringent/vinegar finish.  Body feels thin for the style, probably from the carbonation issue.  Wouldnt even be good if considered to be a sour ale instead of a barley wine.

Enticing aroma of oak and booze mostly (it is really difficult to distinguish between whiskey, brandy, or even possibly rum in this case).  Also some vanilla pokes through in the aroma.  The flavor is really good with everything from chocolate to vanilla, coconut to dark fruit, and some combination of either brandy or whiskey.  The alcohol is certainly noticeable as this one does burn a bit.  The biggest downfall is the lack of any carbonation (which could be a product of aging but I somehow doubt it).

Overall, this is a stunning multi-dimensional beer which is still somehow incredibly balanced and restrained.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"
3054,"2011-06-12",4.0,"Bottle from Vinmonopolet in Valkendorfsgate, Bergen. Ive had the famous bourbon barrel version before, now its time to see what the original is like. :-) Pours a near-black deep brown body with a small, light beige head which disappears quickly - as expected. Nose is fantastic, with deep malty caramel notes blended with oaky peanut vanilla and port hints, along with notes of that barley wine woody hazelnut aroma I like so much. Taste is a sophisticated composition of alcohol-propelled wooden vanilla tones, peanuts, burnt caramel, nuts, deep malts, dense bitter hops and hints of salty licorice. Extremely well-balanced, as Ive known Lost Abbey to be in most - if not all - occasions. Warming alcohol finish, subtly wrapped in bitter licorice hops. A really great winter warming barley wine, which most beer geeks like me enjoy just as much in the summer. Another winner from Lost Abbey! :-)","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"
3054,"2011-06-09",0.5,"This review reflects a bottle of 2010 Brandy Angels Share that I opened on 5/21/11. It cost me $16.99 for the 375 ml bottle. Let me first say that I find this brewery to be a bunch of cowards. See the end of review for clarification.The cork came out with no sound. It poured black with no head and zero carbonation-not a hint. The aroma was nothing like brandy or any barrel. It was very tart with tons of dark fruits, cherries and lots of grapes but it also seems moldy or like a pile of poop The taste was unbelievably bad and exteremely undrinkable. Massive tart cherry and grape like taste with a moldy taste and Im not making this up-poop. I tried to muster the strength to down it but it was THE WORST BEER IVE EVER HAD. Complete drainpour.


I decided to email the brewey and send them some feedback about it in a respectful way to see what they could do about it. Also to give them a chance to make it right. Now this was 2 weeks before the V009 release and Im sure they are busy people. I heard nothing back just crickets and they totally ignored me. Fast forward to a few days after the V009 release and a user on another site complained about a missing V009 label. He said he emailed the brewery and they responded back within the same day and said they would fix that situation. This is a missing label mind you not the actual product inside. I was a little peeved that I had emailed them more than 2 weeks before about the actual product and they ignored me. But they were really quick to respond about a very minor issue. I sent another email to ask if they care about there customers(which they dont) since they ignored me. After hounding them they offered me a T-shirt ( I wouldnt want to sport your gear now)and told me they couldnt refund my money because a lot of bad seeds had taken advantage of them. Let me tell Lost Abbey you are the ones taking advantage of people not the other way around.


This brewery could learn a lot from stand up breweries like Deschutes and Cigar City who admit when they make mistakes. Intstead these Lost people are hiding behind a curtain and refuse to address a problem because they are cowards. I respect a brewery who when they find a QC problem make a formal announcement(blog post, BA or RB post, just something) and try to make it right. Instead these cowards would rather there customers buy a defective product and screw us consumers over just so they can move on to the next batch. That is horrid customer service and I do not know how I can not give this beer any points because 1) It was a terrible beer and 2) they refuse to acknowledge anything when given the chance to make it right. Clearly these people are Lost at the ""Abbey""","San Antonio, Texas, USA","Hopper"
3054,"2011-06-08",3.1,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2011 2010 bottle. Pours deep brown, no carbonation. Nose is vanilla, wood, and a touch of charcoal.

The taste is quite good. Vanilla, some bittersweet cocoa, very nice oak and roasted malt, just a touch of brandy. Interesting acidity, very high. Almost has a sour note to it. Dont know if this is by design or if its poor storage on the part of the market. My initial thought is that its by design, as it tastes very good. It is, however, a little out of balance which is why Im a little curious. Tastes as though its a product of the brandy, as that seems a prominent partner.

Overall great beer. No alcohol, very surprising for 11.5%. The acidity was a little out of balance and the oak/brandy is a little too domineering for me to give this a better score. Very happy, though.

EDITED TO ADD: The ""sour"" note got more and more pronounced with each sip. By halfway through it was wildly out of balance. Did some research and it looks like maybe this batch was infected. 

Still a good beer, but got hard to drink the whole thing. You could tell something was off, and messing with the flavor of an otherwise stellar effort.","San Diego, California, USA","tool2scream"

The flavor is predominantly vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, prune, and a slight bitterness in the finish. Not much alcohol warmth at all for 11.5% abv. Mouthfeel is utterly flat and disappointing. Like drinking a warm Coca Cola that had been sitting on a store shelf for 2 years. Id had high hopes for this, but it just didnt measure up.

3054,"2011-05-24",3.0,"2010 vintage. 375 mL bottle. Lost Abbey tulip.

APPEARANCE: Black. Tinge of light caramel brown/cola.
Head is practically inexistent and minimal foam dissipates quickly. Minimal amount of light tan foam left only around circumference of glass. Zero lace. 

AROMA: Caramel, cola, chocolate, brandy, brandied raisins. 
Hints of prunes, vinous character, as well as some faint nutty notes. 

TASTE: Vinous, caramel, cola, brandy, brandied raisins, grape juice, chocolate, oak. More vinous and cola character on finish.
Hints of tart red stone fruit (e.g., cherry).  

MOUTH FEEL: Nearly inexistent carbonation. Alcohol is relatively mellow for the abv  i.e., alcohol warmth is quite light. Light puckering on finish  due to vinous character. 
OVERALL: Avoid the 2010 vintage due to infection. Although it seemed infection in this particular bottle had yet to take over the ale completely (as some others have written about this vintage) it was definitely undesirable. Unexpected vinous character is prominent on taste, with mild tartness on finish. Despite the above, the caramel, brandy, and cola notes on the nose are fairly pleasant. Would like to try another vintage without infection. Taste is more like barley wine like aged with bacteria in red wine barrels rather than brandy barrels.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"

It doesnt sound like its *supposed* to be completely flat, but its probably not supposed to be ""fully"" carbonated either.   Okay, moving on.  Strong port wine aroma coming off this.  First taste was strange since it was totally flat and didnt think it was going to be drinkable.   But since I actually like port wine and this definitely has that flavor, I kept going.  Good thing as this actually became quite enjoyable.  Prune is the dominate flavor here with vanilla and bourbon-like flavors in the background.   A bit of licorice spice and molasses n the mix.  Leaves a funny tingly feeling behind and the port/prune flavor.   Thinking back (and its been a looong time), this reminds me of Sam Adams Triple Bock.

The aroma is relatively strong delivering a ton of vanilla on the nose with a finish that provides some nice depth with oak dominating followed by some distinct bourbon flavor. 

The taste is super super sweet. There is a ton of vanilla, which is nice, but probably too much here. BI BCS is a better example that provides the perfect amount. The vanilla would be more tolerable if it was better balanced out with other flavors. If there was big hit of oak or bourbon to break up the vanilla which really lasts to the end, then it could be ok.

The feel is pretty poor, its very light without much lasting flavor.

The drinkability is limited by its one-note-edness.

Flavor is lightly fruity and very rich with chocolate and toffee as well as slight boozy character and slight big-red-wine character (like a red zin) in fruitiness, body, and dryness (that finishes with a soft tickle of acidity). Big and malty. Dry chocolatey vinous finish. Mouthfeel is drying with brisk bubbles and medium body that is quite velvety in texture. Overall, very interesting. Not what I expected, but quite good.

Aroma is intensely rich with molasses and maple and slight tart fruit acidity and some alcohol. Flavor starts intensely rich with caramel, chocolate, touches of cherry and grape, with light boozy notes - like sweet vermouth wit lots of malt sweetness. Rich in the finish with hints of licorice and vanilla and dark sweet malts. Boozy warm finish. Mouthfeel has touches of tingly bubbles - despite the flat appearance.

Fearing a bad seal in the cork, I smelled the beer, but could not detect any heavy oxidation aromas, so the flatness seemed to be by design.  The smell was very vinous, and reminded me of raisins soaked in whiskey.  The taste was sweet and oaky, with lots of vanilla and raisins, and no hops.

But I let it warm and then I really enjoyed it. It was over my head I think. Total complexity. All the things you want in a american strong...dark oaky, rich malts, sweet yet balanced. There was definitely a sutle tartness about this beer. And it was slightly bitter on the finish. Showed it weight in alcohol when you drank it but wasnt overpowering. Chewy mouthfeel, especially without carbonation....which I enjoyed for this brew. I was surprised to find bourbon barrel qualities when it was the brandy barrel angels share.

Excellent strength.  Flavor is sweet and strong with all the dark fruits found in the nose and then some, along with molasses, caramel, vanilla, oak, anise, some definite wine-like qualities.  Alcohol has a warming effect but is integrated well without being too hot or solvent.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sticky, zero carbonation.  A fantastic brew, but the lack of carbonation keeps it from reaching its full potential.

3054,"2011-02-01",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2011 2009 on tap at Churchills anniversary. 

The appearance was alluring. It poured a deep dark brown with a burgundy copper hue with a thin off white lacing. The color lent a bit of mystique as to how it would smell and taste. After a few seconds of looking at all I could think was, ""man I hope this beer tastes as complex as it looks!""

This beer smells like Caramel and bourbon with chocolate in the background and oak. A slight hint of vanilla and maple syrup are present as well.

The taste can be compared to a beer version of wonkas everlasting gobstopper. For the first second it was bourbon, followed immediately by caramel, then a nutty oak with a little smoke, finished with a slight bit of vanilla and more oak. The longer I kept it in my mouth the more the profile would change and develop. I tried to let it sit for a while but unlike wonkas gobstopper this treat did come to an end (an empty glass).

Mouthfeel was prefect. It has a rich silky feel at first and transitions to an almost savory feel if that makes sense.

The drinkability is top notch. I drank it as slow as I could but it didnt last more than 15 minutes and I was in great company too but nothing could stop me from plowing through it.

3054,"2010-10-30",4.0,"2009, brandy barrel, opened to celebrate my wifes birthday.  Its a walnut brown beer with lovely ruby highlights and, as expected with no pop of the cork, there is no head - just a few watery bubbles.  But, as if to make up for this, the legs are impressive indeed, looking like a fine spirit.  And the nose!  What a nose!  Its heavily wooded and as heavily drenched in brown sugar, maple syrup and molasses.  As the beer breathes this aroma grows port-like and so very nutty.  These notes carry through to the palate, but here the brandy is felt, both in taste and in the alcohol heat.  I really enjoyed the chest burn from this; something so spirited needs the booze just to cut through some of the saturated flavour.  The body is very thick and, yes, completely flat.  I thought the 2008 Older Viscosity was a shameful beer to have no carbonation in; but here the lack of fizz is well suited.

Unfortunately the bottle I got had zero carbonation in it which Ive heard is common for this year. This would have been almost a perfect beer had it not been completely flat.

3054,"2010-09-07",4.4,"""im grading the Brandy Barrel (standard) Angels Share, but it hasnt been 10.5% since 2006. 11.5 in 07, and mine (08) came in at 12.5, same as the bourbon barrel. the funny thing is, the massive amounts of malt used still brought out vanilla/oak characteristics of bourbon aging, but sans the pepper. In addition to that, this was easily the darkest barleywine ive ever seen, althought the 12 months (not 6) it spent in barrels renders the beer style nearly obselete. beyond the obvious, the warming effect of the alcohol was very pleasant, although at first i though it was going to be a little hot. the tobacco/cigar flavor added an unexpected level of complexity to the malt, vanilla, and sweet raisin flavors. This is a great sipper, surprisingly not cloyingly sweet, given the aroma and lack of hops in the flavor. no issues here. best...cigar...beer...ever? different bottle 12/09-the tobacco still there a little in the aroma but not so much in the flavor. more brandied fruitcake, and a touch hotter. still excellent, but slipped JUST enough to let the Bourbon Barrel surpass it.""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

A - Very dark mahogany, almost black, with a smaller than average, tight, foamy light beige head. Disappears pretty fast leaving a bit of patchy lacing.

S - Rich alcohol dominates the nose with brandy dominant, but some rum also sneaks in. Good amount of oakiness. Some dark chocolate and caramel malt also in there with some cherry and grape aroma with other dark fruits (plum and fig) with a slight tart/vinous aroma.

T - Very strong brandy taste with a lot of grape, plum, and fig dark fruit flavors. Quite a vinous taste to it. Starts off a bit more sweet and jamy with the dark fruit and this gives way to the brandy taste. Some dark malt and a bit of earthiness and roasted flavor, but this is really a background flavor.

M - Medium body with little carbonation. Very smooth and slick feeling. 

D - Brandy and alcohol flavor is a little too strong for me to really consider it all that drinkable. Not horribly drinkable, but not bad.

Notes: Vintage 2008. This picked up a lot of the brandy flavor and is a very vinous beer. Hints of dark malt come out, but it is really an afterthought.

3054,"2010-05-05",4.3,"Draught at 515.   Totally random find if you ask me.   I like this Norcal Lost Abbey distribution nonsense that is going on.   Served in a snifter with a brown looking body that has honey edges and a very scant head that leaves lasting beige foam.   The aroma is a total brown sugar, dried fruit (dates), oak, and brandy bomb.   The barrel treatment blends so well into the malt that you almost cant tell how heavily barrel-aged this beer is.   Its heavy.   The flavor is sweet and rich, but with enough alcohol and oak tannin to provide all the balance that you would want in a sipper of this magnitude.   Hops are buried.   There is a light chocolate donut touch to go with the brown sugar and oak.   Decadent and rounded.   Full and silky, with perhaps a little more carbonation than is optimal, but a little swirling remedies that easily.   A very nice barrel-aged barley wine, which is probably my favorite style to put in a spirit barrel.   Heavy on the brandy, but it just works in this case.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"
3054,"2010-05-05",4.2,"Rating #1000. 375ml bottle, 2009 Vintage. Pours a very deep brown, mostly black colored body with a reddish tint. Absolutely no head that leaves only a clear, oily lacing on the glass. Wow, this aroma is excellent. Abundant, complex, sweet, bold, and very soft. Tons of dates and figs, sweet fruits, extremely rich caramels, chocolate, buttered nuts, brown sugar, molasses, licorice, and smooth vanilla. Behind all that is sweet brandy, raisin and plummy bourbon, and a soft oak. A welcoming alcohol ever so slightly creeps in as well. Flavor is a bit more about the brandy, but still very nice. An alcohol heat sits on top of everything reminding me to take this one slowly. Personally, I think a couple years in the cellar would do this best, but I appreciate the soothing quality of the alcohol. It doesnt distract me from the rest of the flavors. Tons of rich molasses, figs, dates, caramel, and buttery nuts alongside pitted, dark fruits. The vanilla and wood comes out more in the flavor than the aroma and the chocolate falls back a bit. A light spice joins the soft wood and brandy as they grow towards the finish and help this slowly and delicately dry with a subtle, but present bitterness. Very lengthy aftertaste with a moderate alcohol warmth. Full, silky, oily, chewy, creamy body with a very light, syrupy carbonation. Very interesting palate with many different feels to it. Overall, I figured rating #1000 was as good a time as ever to open this one. Sure, its probably a little young as the flavor clearly has a rich, sweet brandy element to it, but this is extremely complex and well put together. I would love to try the past vintages. Great barrel work making for a very impressive beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Dark brown almost black in appearance, with little head or carbonation present. Pleasant alcohol and brandy aroma along with some vanilla and oak. Intense flavor that just really blew me away. More pleasant brandy and alcohol flavors, along with dark fruits, vanilla, oak and roasted maltiness.  Little or no carbonation gives the beer more brandy-like qualities. Full bodied, thick and oily.

3054,"2010-04-30",4.6,"On tap at 515 in Santa Cruz. Ive tried most of Lost Abbeys rarer barrel program beers but this, one of the most common ones, has always eluded me. And even when I did see it in stores, I was wary of paying 30 bucks for probably flat beer. So obviously Im extremely excited to pay five bucks for a snifterful of the stuff. 
  
Nice deep mahogany color with a fluffy tan head that sticks around quite a while. Aroma is fantastic. Lush brandy notes, plenty of sweet toffee maltiness, vanilla, fruits, and a bit of spice. The flavor is out of this world. Raisins, molasses, pudding, chocolate, high-quality spirits, caramel, port. Thick and sweet, definitely a sipper meant to be enjoyed slowly. A little heat but not too much. Nice lasting finish.
  
For all the shit Lost Abbey gets over their carbonation problems, I felt that the level of CO2 in my force-carbonated glassful was far too high. It would have been completely suitable by any other beers standards, but that much carbonation in The Angels Share is TOO MUCH. After a period of swirling to kill off the excess, the result was simply incredible. This beer clearly CLEARLY benefits from lower carbonation.
  
Note to LA carbonation haters: Youre wrong. You are wrong. Your palate is wrong, your taste is wrong, your reviews are wrong, your indignation is wrong, your opinion. is. wrong.
  
Angels Share is right.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

Bold all around. I think of this almost like a blend between the barrel aged barley wine and imperial stout styles.

Also, a subtly sweet vanilla, and some dark pitted fruits. A great sipper here. Soothing alcohol is probably the best way I can describe it, but definitely rich, creamy, strong, but not at all hard to go down. Quite woody with a heavy bourbon/brandy presence in the flavors. The nutty caramels seem to stand out to me though. Grainy, roasted almonds with rich, bittersweet caramel. Balanced out with a fairly non-distinct earthy hop.

Fruitiness, jam and fruit cake, syrupy thickness takes on a bit. I enjoyed the bourbon more, this is a bit sweet for me but the flavors are full, stick to the palate well, touch of bitterness.

S: This is definitely not for the faint of heart. A rich, chocolatey aroma with lots of brandy notes and also a bit of oak and sugar.

T: The flavors follow the nose for the most part. The brandy is very prominent on the front end but quickly fades to a combination of chocolate, brown sugar, and a slight oakiness on the finish.

3054,"2010-02-21",4.3,"375 mL bottle of the 2009 vintage purchased at the brewery on release day in January 2010.  Yes, the 2009 has (some) carbonation.  Pours a dark brown.  Although it is quite effervescent coming out of the bottle (even making some noise), it produces no head.  Wonderful aroma of caramel, wood, maple syrup, chocolate, vanilla, and some (pleasant) booze/brandy.  Flavor is similarly wonderful and complex, containing much of the same as found in the nose with a great rich chocolate-ness coming forward more.  The finish has more rich fudge-like chocolate goodness along with a distinct booziness (just in case you werent sure you were drinking a great big beer).  Whatever carbonation was here seems to have escaped very quickly.  Though it seems to have become popular to rip on Lost Abbey over carbonation issues, it doesnt stop this from being a world-class beer along with its bourbon-barrel cousin.  How much carbonation do you need in a sipping beer this big and rich anyway?  But $15 for a 375 mL bottle is on the pricey side...

Comment:
A very interesting and complex beer. There where allot of different flavours both sour and sweet with a combo of different aromas. If this is a barley wine (never thought of it while tasting) I would say its more of an english style barley wine rather then the more hopped up varieties we usually get from the US. I think it would work great with cheese, preferable something tasty like a strong blue cheese and some sweet marmelade or similar. However it worked just great on its own.","Örebro, SWEDEN","olsvammel"

3054,"2010-01-27",4.0,"Tasted from a 750 ml bottle from the 2008 vintage.

Appearance - Pours with no head whatsoever.  It is completely opaque and cloudy.  The color is almost black with a tint of red.

Aroma - Molasses and brown sugar malt are the first aromas that come to mind.  It is also slightly nutty due to some oxidation.  It smells a bit like a high alcohol zinfandel.  The brandy characteristics are truly coming through.

Taste - High in alcohol.  Burnt brown sugar, with a nice charred bitterness.  There is a very dried fruitiness, date or fig, that is faint but quickly wiped out by the high alcohol.  The nutiness comes through lightly as well.  I would rate this beer as having a high complexity.  Every drink I take, I am getting a new flavor.  Now, a musty earthiness is coming through as well.

Palate - This completely coats the palate with a full body, consistent of the high alcohol.  The feel is also very round, hitting and sticking with every part of the palate.  I have read a lot about people having problems with carbonation in this beer.  It does not pour a head, but on the palate, it feels like a beer.  Although the bubbles are very small and dissipate quickly, they are undoubtedly there.

Overall - This is very interesting, and not really like any other beer I have had.  I really enjoy it, and think it will continue to get better with even more bottle age.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
3054,"2010-01-25",4.1,"On tap at Blue Palms.  Cant believe I havent entered my past ratings for this yet--wait, yes I can.  2009--listed at 12%--cloudy orange ruby with a small light beige head, and didnt take long too fade to nothing.  The only thing detracting in the nose is some pretty intense old scorched toffee/raisin sweetness.  Other than that, fantastic.  Lots of old barrels, leather, tobacco, and caramel toffee notes.  Some alcohol is present as well.  Thankfully the flavor isnt quite so diabetes-inducing.  The booze and barrel dries out the beer to make it taste nothing short of great, and seems a couple years old already.  Lots of caramel and scorched toffee, chocolate, raisin/fig notes with some barrel and leathery goodness.  Semi-dry with bitterness at a 3.  Big full thick body with minimal carbonation.  Very tasty, hope the bottles turn out the same, but with a little more carbonation.  That said, Tomme must like the carb as it currently is with this force carbonated keg, so Im not crossing my fingers.

beautiful pour... opaque orange-ish burgundy brown and 100% still. 

extremely fruity nose... the brandy sing in this... apples cooked down with brown sugar, raisins and spices along with vanilla, wood and notes of chocolate... lovely. 

the flavor is just as rich... cocoa butter, vanilla, chocolate, toasted nuts, caramel/butterscotch, spice kick and some prune-y fruitiness. there is a nice dry tingling on the finish along with some alcohol warmth in the chest and a lingering aftertaste of quality apple wine. it is sweet but manages to avoid sticky or cloying until the second glass... it gets a little taxing to drink alone since the full body lacks any carbonation to wipe off the sugary coating on the palate.

It was an exciting moment when the cork was out of the bottle. Would it smack or would nothing happen? The answer is that nothing happened, the beer was completely non-carbonated.

The color was very dark but not completely pitch black. No foam. Not the prettiest of sights.  

The aroma reminded a little about wine with elements of nougat, oak, caramel and some heat from the alcohol. Interesting and different aroma.

First sip was very special, a lot of flavors attacked the palate. Some burnt tones, licorice, vanilla, soy, fruit and a slight acidity was the first things I thought of. Complex, but certainly one might wonder how it would taste carbonated. Now it was a hell of a lot of flavors that did not really hang together. Good yes, but not world class.

Ok, Im well aware of the carbonation issues with this beer but its one Ive wanted to try for a while now so I was still looking forward to it.  First of all, the aroma is amazing.  Brandy, toffee, molasses, plums, red licorice, oak, blend to make a wonderful scent.  Deep brown color with some red tint and no surprise pours out with no head at all, even with a vigorous pour (hey, I can try!).  A few lonely bubbles float around the edges.  The lack of carbonation doesnt at all kill this beer, its very tasty, but man with just a little it really would be world class (and perhaps almost worth the price).  Warming, soothing, with some alcohol burn to let you know its there but otherwise gentle.  After all the negative stuff on this beer I really thought I was going to bash it but not the case.  No carbonation its still very good.  Properly carbonated, Id like to find out! 

Re-Rate 2009 -- light pop.  Doesnt pour with really any head but there is light carbonation which does help.  The aroma is just amazing with this stuff.  Brandy, caramel, raisins, molasses, plums, wood, brown sugar, and some other stuff I think I just forgot.  Nice and soothing sipper. Slightly peppery in the finish but not a lot of booze showing.  Raisin, caramel and brandy are strong in the flavors, the other stuff from the aroma adding complexity.  Notes of toffee show here too.  The flavor isnt quite up to the level of the aroma but its very good and perhaps just needs a tad more carbonation (but its close).  I can see why all the fuss.... yeah, the price demands quality but this stuff is pretty awesome so its a shame when batches of a world class brew are released undercarbonated.  Im fine with the light carbonation in this batch.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

Okay we all now about the carbonation issues that Lost Abbey has had some Im simply going to say this one was totally and completely flat and leave it at that. Aroma was great with the brandy up front but not in an overpowering way. Lots of sweet malt flavors, toffee, raisin, dark fruits, melted caramel, barrel and alcohol make up the remainder. Despite the lack of visible carbonation there is still a slight tingling in your mouth, probably from the 12.5% ABV, along with a medium body and a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. The flavor starts off lots of brandy and alcohol and finishes that way as well. In between however there are some grainy bread notes, caramel and toffee, raisin and oak. This is one good beer despite the carbonation issues and what a way to ring in my 1,500th rating just minutes before the Vikings/Panthers Sunday night game.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
3054,"2009-12-20",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 4, 2010 Bouteille de 750 ml chez David et Catherine. Édition inconnue, mais la bière était définitivement carbonée. Arômes très intenses de chocolat, de caramel décadent, dalcool fort et de vanille. Robe brune et trouble, pas très belle, effervescence de moyenne à faible, légère mousse. Très maltée et sucrée en bouche, on retrouve beaucoup de caramel brûlé, du chocolat, des touches dalcool fort et de fruits mûrs. Très complexe. Finale sucrée et assez douce, où lalcool fait une présence discrète. À la fois intense et bien équilibré.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MJGG"
3054,"2009-12-19",4.6,"2008 bottle. Pours a deep rich blackish brown with very little to no carbonation. the smell is rich and deep chocolate with some malt. The taste is intensely vanilla. Alcohol is fairly present in the aroma along with the taste but not nearly as much as you would think for the ABV. Richly vanilla with definite hints of the bourbon barrel. Awesome fucking beer

3054,"2009-12-10",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2009 2008 vintage.

Very dark brown with small ruby edges, basically opaque. Absolutely no head, no lacings, nothing happens when I swirl the glass.

A decent amount of boozy brandy aromas. Fudge, caramel, vanilla, wood and brandy. You can really tell that the beer suffers from the lack of carbonation, its like the aromas are stuck without the ability to hijack the carbonation and escape the liquid. Too bad, but still a good smell.

The taste is better with more things going on. Its very sweet with lots of brandy notes. Vanilla, fudge, dark caramel and nice oak barrel flavors. Some fruit aromas and raisins. The finish is really boozy with a brandy-like character. Quite an intense flavor, thats just slightly too boozy.

Full-bodied, sticky texture. Absolutely no carbonation, completely flat.

Although it obviously suffers from the lack of carbonation, its still a really good beer. Perhaps it could have been slightly less boozy, but the brandy flavors give it a rather rich character.

NOTE: Ive tried two more bottles of the same batch, both during late fall/winter in 2009 and in both of them there seem to have developed a strange tartness that I did not pick up when I tried it the first time.

Aroma is actually quite enticing, even surprisngly subdued compared to its bigger bourbon brother.  Caramel, Vanilla, tobacco come out.  Can the flavor survive the mouth?  Im dying to find out...The answer is yes and no.  The flavor, showing similar hints of the scent characteristics, is clearly good, quite great even.  It certainly is there, but it is not enough to overpower the water-like level of carbonation.  I like my big beers thick and nearly flat.  This isnt nearly flat, this is still.

3054,"2009-08-17",4.3,"No shocker as far as appearance goes, the barleywine division is pretty well established as a headless horseman of sorts, making you wonder where is the head of this dark beast, seconds later splitting your head in half with its weapon, melting through your tongue 1st and then splitting your corpus callosum.  Your head writhes with agony and yet adulation.  This nightrider comes at you with a very dark brown body that is totally opaque.  The head long disappeared likely in the wort many months ago.  Well the first taste is surprising I expected to be split in half, I am writing so let me tell you what I found.  The initial taste is a combination of pinot noir, roast, and scotch very softly melded together to form an amalgam of beer majesty.  The figs also shine, the dark fruits are tied to the roast with a licorice and vanilla accent.  This beer is flavor rich as your going to find.  Not for the novice, and yet open enough for a beginner with red wine or whiskey leanings could sample.  Initial aromas range from soft vanilla to dark anisette licorice in between lies a dark port wine intensity, a deep dark roasted malt, a well hidden bit of fig also lurks, as it warms burnt sugar emerges.  The feel is very complex, a nice richness that is velvety, alcoholic sting is vouchsafed by the intense flavors, but be sure its the real deal.  Your not going to not get laced, its spirits quickly consume at a heady 12.5%, and if you age it be even more prepared.  If your out somewhere that actually has this, be prepared to get a ride.  It is surprisingly smooth, I usually cringe when I hear barleywine.  This is warming and yet not too alcoholic or sweet to the taste.  This is really a splitter or for rebottling and used only as a complimentary beverage.  Its character and alcohol allow it to sit provided you have the means to recork  Nightcap as well, works here.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"

3054,"2009-08-03",4.3,"2008 with craftycarl21. Dark brown pour with almost no carbonation- a small ring of beige foam graces he perimeter of my snifter, welcoming me to sniff. Aroma has an extremely powerful caramel and dark fruit profile that is complemented by some burnt dark sugars. Molasses, toffee, brown sugar, maple syrup, and tons of vanilla further push the envelope of this massive aroma. Vinous notes come as the brew warms, trailing off with raisin, fig, and an alcohol warming. Flavor is riddled with caramel, toffee, creamy dark sugar, and tons of vanilla. Very sweet and very alcoholic. Some vinous notes round out the fruit character of the brew, along with a decidedly pronounced dark fruit aspect. Palate is syrupy, thick, rich, and almost creamy. Very minimal carbonation, but enough to conclude that this particular beer didnt yet fall victim to recent bottling issues. Aroma is intense, flavors come in from every angle, and the mouthfeel is supple- not too much to criticize.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"

Flavor is fantastic as well; starts with a lot of caramel,vanilla, and dark fruit, but as it progresses towards the finish, both the flavors and the palate intensify. The palate gets much richer, and notes of cream, chocolate, and brown sugar come to the surface. Also increasing as the flavor develops is the alcohol presence, which builds to a very strong but oh so welcome singe on the tongue by the finish.

The taste is sweet, then tart, but not a typical sourness that I have seen with infections, more like fruit skin, as Guerde said. Vanilla, chocolate, oak, various dark fruits and malt at the end. Medium-thick mouthfeel, smooth and had a long, dry finish. Didnt gush when I opened it, had just about the right level of carbonation, and the tartness that was there worked quite well for it.

3054,"2009-08-01",3.9,"(bottle 2007 vintage, big thanks to Philsner for sharing!)  Pours a dark muddy brown with a beige colored head that sticks around and leaves decent lacing on the glass.  The aroma smells of booze soaked fruit, with aromas of strawberry, plums, raisin, and brown sugar as well.  Theres just a bit of oxidation here also.  Further warming reveals the scent of fruit snacks, and the yeast pour produces a scent of stale bread.  The taste is similar to the aroma in many ways, and is composed of three stages.  The beginning stage is sweet with brown sugar and some caramel.  These sweet flavors quickly give way to a slightly tart and salty mid-palate, that has the character of wine, salt, oak, and blueberry and plum skins.  Further warming really made the blueberry and vinous tones more dominant.  The third stage is the finish of vanilla and chocolate, with a slight bit of oak lingering as well.  The mouthfeel was full and the carbonation was smooth.  There was a bit of tartness in the mid-palate, but I do not believe this bottle was heavily infected.

Thanks to two generous traders for sending me bottles of this.  Having tried it I now plan on sitting on the other for at least a year to see if the carbonation comes back or if it mellows out a bit.  Generally top notch I cant wait to try the Bourbon version and see the contrasts and similarities.  If youve got a generous friend who can send you some its worth $15 a bottle (though perhaps not $30 for a full 750).

Aroma / Appearance - The headspace is dense and rich with a mixture of licorice, chocolate, sherry/brandy, booze, and a feel like that of a flourless chocolate cake.  Very low on carbonation, though hard to tell through the dark body, it exudes blackness into the area around the glass.

Flavor / Palate - Not quite as good as it smell it is nonetheless a top notch contender.  Rich and warm the only flaw might be the flatness which I dont expect from a year old barleywine.  Chocolate, brandy, and figs compensate nicely however.  Sticking to the throat from the start it grabs your attention and refuses to let go.  This feels like a beer you would drink with dessert or afterwards while resting on the porch during a cool fall evening/winter afternoon.  Im glad to have tried it; clearly Lost Abbey is still on top of their game here.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Took the cage off and hoped I would hear a hiss or pop or something from the cork... no such luck.  Pours a deep brown, mahogany with zero head.  Legs line a scotch.  No carbonation period.  Sorry Tomme, this aint under carbonated, this is flat.  Still, Im willing to give this the benefit of the doubt.  The aroms is really nice.The brandy comes through really well, apples, peaches, cookie dough, caramel, candy.  Flavor is really great, it tastes like a caramel apple.  The sweetness of the malts teams really well with the fruitiness from the brandy barrel.  Tons of caramel, some coconut, vanilla, sort of a sour mash thing, slight orange.  Slightly oily on the tongue, sweet finish with a gentle warmth provided by the alcohol.  Man, I wish this was carbonated because this was really good, but the absence of CO2 really hurts the look, nose, flavor and mouthfeel.  Was it worth the $15 for the split?  Maybe, maybe not.

3054,"2009-07-03",4.0,"500!!!! Well, everyone has been partially right on the flatness. It does detract somewhat from the beer, although considering how potent/complex this one is, all is not lost. Most complex barley wine aroma Ive ever had....dark chocolate, whiskey, oak, anise, fig, plum, vanilla...in a sense very port-like. The aroma is better as the beer warms...indeed it seems at its best when the beer is room temperature. Flavor is just as complex, with everything mentioned in the aroma coming out on the palate. Again, gets better as it warms. In the end, there are only two issues with the beer: one is the alcoholic bite, which can be taken care of with some cellaring; the other is the carbonation, which results in a thin, watery mouthfeel. I think with better carbonation this would be a great barley wine, instead of just a pretty good one.","Norman, Oklahoma, USA","milljam"

Of course no head to speak of. The aroma was special. Chocolate covered cherries, wood, vanilla, anise, kalua. The taste had a little carbonation, but not much. Very thick with a strong bourbon like flavor of oak and vanilla. What I liked was that every sip yielded a different flavor. Thats the sign of a top notch beer.

3054,"2009-06-08",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2010 2008 bottle.  Wow, no head whatsoever, completely flat; color is a dark mocha.  Nose is pleasant and potent with toffee, burnt caramel, lots of vanilla, notable brandy oak, dates, warming alcohol, and dark candi sugar.  Flavor is much of the same notes with more brandy than I expected; lightly charred oak, lots of brandy burn on the back of the throat, Belgian chocolate, toffee, vanilla, dark candi sugar, and hints at raisins.  Palate is full, lightly syrupy, round, flat to soft, and nearly hot.  Finishes only average in length, still with brandy burn, and notes of toffee, vanilla, and lots of charred oak.  What a peculiar beer; amazing ratings, no head and minimal carbonation, and lots of brandy to go around.  Maybe I had a bad bottle, but either way, it could have used more time to age.  The nose and the flavors were good but not great, but maybe with a better bottle and some time in the cellar, it could have been exceptional.  If the price were more reasonable, I would put some bottles in the cellar now. But as is, I will have to wait until the beer is cheaper or I make more money.


I tried a 375 mL 2009 bottle and found much of the same.  It is a beer that I could maybe like more with age, a lot of age, but right now, it is just  a nice, unique, and dare I say, expensive, beer that I like but have no interest in trying very often.  Great brewery(ies) but adequate try at perfection.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

3054,"2009-06-03",3.2,"Bottle of the 2008 vintage.  Color is a solid muddy brown with almost no carbonation and no head at all.  Aroma is a sweet vanilla, coffee and dried fruit scent with a whiff of alcohol.  Taste is rich and flat.  Starting with a full body it goes down with a flat sweet feel.  Finish comes in sweet with just a hint of dried fruit, a touch of vanilla then a big brandy and oak like taste.  After taste has a strong alcohol feel that leaves you warm inside and ends with a slight bitterness.  Im very disappointed, why cant Lost Abbey get the carbonation right, most that I have had, have had poor carbonation.  This seems like it could be a good brew if it had even a little carbonation, but it comes across a bit bland and flat.  I am very torn with this brew, after drinking it awhile my taste adjusted to it (could be the alcohol kicking in) and I get a little more complexity in the character, but for the price and I am still very disappointed and yet I like it.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"

Nose was just insane...notes of candied red apple, pipe tobacco, vanilla, caramel, black cherries, dark brown sugar and oak.  The body on this was the biggest surprise...even though there was very little carbonation, I actually thought the lack thereof complimented the brew nicely.

3054,"2009-05-30",3.5,"Pours a dark brown, surprisingly opaque, with absolutely no head, lacing, or apparent carbonation. Aroma is fine, complex; Loads of caramel malt as promised, cherry, chocolate, whiskey, and vanilla. The most complex aroma Ive ever gotten from a barleywine, no doubt. Flavor, however, is where this heads south. The flavor is pure brandy for crying out loud! That and a little cocoa and Merlot. The flavor is decent, dont get me wrong, but thats it: Just decent, not world-class. Profound, mostly because of how the alcohol bitch-slaps your motherfuckin ass, but not particularly satisfying. Vanilla comes through at the end. Mouthfeel is just okay. I mean, flavor aside, its like drinking red wine; About the same viscosity and carbonation (none). I consider myself a barleywine fan, but not here. This stuff is just too goofy. Id have again, but not on my dime (or $32 for a 750ml).

Appearance: Pours a dark brown body with a thinnish, wispy, beige-hued head.

Smell: Lightly sweet-smelling, particularly fruit nose smelling of homemade jams and marmalade dosed with sugars, booze, and dusky wood notes.

Taste: A sweet (initially) swirl of dark fruits, spiced fig jam, graham cracker crumbs, vanilla sugar, and particularly punchy oak tannins. Very meager hints of roast. A small sprinkling of dark brown sugar and lightly smoked fresh grains. Faint earthy bitterness perceived midway. More puckering oak tastes as it is unwavering. Tablespoon of belly-warming, soul-pleasing brandy. Touch of earthiness in the semi-sweet finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-low carbonation.

Drinkability: For me, it wasnt quite deserving of the perceived inflated hype and permissive praise, nor was it one of the accused, loathsome issue-prone bottles. So, I hit happily somewhere in the middle -- a fine beer to accompany me through a few episodes of House and catching up on my e-mail.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

I did that, and there was still nothing. Flat as could be. I will say that this does have a great aroma of vanilla, brandy or whiskey... whatever,, and some hints of malt. Flavor was pretty good. Palate was really hot in my opinion, and the alcohol was way too present. Overall, it wasnt terrible, but for the money I paid, it should have been so much more.

A huge alcohol presence overwhelms everything, and takes a few sips to get used to. This beer is insanely harsh, until you warm up to it and the malt and oak start to take hold. Each sip finishes extremely hot. Lingering oak, and grass flavors. Finish is boozy beyond belief, and takes several minutes to get past. To say that this beer is a sipper, is an understatement. This beer has very few characteristics of an actual barley wine. Did I mention the alcohol? A very enjoyable beer, but too much of a sipper so it loses a few points.

3054,"2009-05-02",2.5,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2009 2008 Brandy Barrel Angels Share 2008. With all the hoopla about this beer going on, I figured I would give it a try and see how bad people are saying it really is...

Appearance - An aggressive pour renders no head, just some bubbles that begin to cling to the edges of the glass quickly. This is a very dark brown color with hints of red and orange. A swirl of the glass gives me a slight coating with maybe 2 bubbles appearing out of nowhere. This is definitely a flat beer...

Smell - Strong brandy and tart cherry comes through on first whiff. There is some vanilla and dark chocolate in there as well. Whoa, last whiff just gave me dirty toilet, what the hell? The alcohol stings the nose a little bit. There are some oaky characteristics coming through too.

Taste - Lots of brandy and man it stings like its brandy. The alcohol is definitely noticeable in this young beer. I taste some blackberries and cherries as well. I am trying to pull out more levels but that alcohol sting is just too distracting. Just got a huge shot of vanilla with that last gulp.

Mouthfeel - No carbonation makes this feel lifeless. It isnt creamy, or viscous, or light; it just, ""is."" It doesnt really coat the mouth like I like, but I can feel it trying to hang on for dear life in my mouth. Some carbonation would have made this a hell of a lot better.

Drinkability - That burning alcohol just kills it for me. It doesnt feel all that good in my mouth. The taste really isnt anything to write home about, but it is its only redeeming quality about this beer. I really wanted this one to be better than a lot of people have been saying about it. To have this on tap would probably be a great opportunity to redeem itself, but I have no chance of that.","Salem, Oregon, USA","josephselander"

3054,"2009-04-29",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2009 This rating for the original 2006 Release.  Supposedly the only excellent bottling so far
In short: A big earthy malt orgy the American way, nothing more, nothing less.  Excellent.
How: Bottle 750ml.  Original bottling ).  Many times at tasting sessions.  This rating for an almost 2 year old bottle.
The look: Near black body topped by a tan ring of foam
In long: One of the most decadent body I have experienced this side of the Gouden Carolus brews.  Thick heavy rich malts, very earthy, a lot of roasted almonds, some dates and a little porto character.  Body is full, decadent but not syrupy.  I didnt pick any brandy character at all, or very little but it might just be because I knew this is brandy barrel aged.  Some tobacco-ish hops partially dry out the beer and provide a light bitterness although we cant talk about balance here.  Moderate sweetness level (relative to style and abv).  Soft carbonation.  Alcohol is not well hidden but it does sit well with the rest of the brew.  This rating was for the original 2006 bottling.  I hear that the 2007 bottling develops infection overtime and the 2008 bottling has serious carbonation problems.  Thats 1 out of 3 so far, thats bad average but it could be worse.

Little if any carbonation is noticed thru the deep deep brown in the glass.  The only translucense is in the top quarter inch of glass, and thats not much light.  Candi sugar, caramel and chocolate malt mask a slight apple tarness.  Body is big and lucious yet not overpowering.  Tannins help with the lingering finish.  Mouthfeel is slick but lasting.

Astounding aroma volume. A molten river of sweet old fashioned candy goodness--toffee, saltwater taffy, milk chocolate; all wrapped up in dusty old hardware store. A sip is glorious liquid silk. This must be the way my cars engine feels when it gets a fresh gallon of 10w-30 poured in. Chocolate, caramel, dried apples, tobacco. Decadent, thick, very fine.

There is also some soy and saltiness. Palate is medium, coating and dead flat. Aftertaste of pure booze. I have had straight Brandy that was about as smooth as this. Syrupy sweet and boozy.

Pours murky-brown, with a hint of red tinge. Visible, thin-layer of clear alcohol rests atop the surface of this lowly-carbonated beer. Aroma is of figs, port wine, sweet brandy alcohol, oak, slight chocolate-caramel malt. Taste is nearly the same as the aroma, with quite a bit of warming (borderline fusel) alcohol. Ok for this beer and its age, though. Very low carbonation hurts the mouth feel just a bit, in my opinion. This is due to the syrupy-sweet, high alcohol flavor of the beer. A bit more carbonation would have helped to cut through the alcohol and syrupy-sweetness just a bit. Overall, a nice beer and, perhaps, more similar to a port in many ways due to the low carbonation.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","bulldogp04"

Fascinating stuff, its like beer/coffee/chocalate in equal parts.
Malt sweetness dominates, soft, velvety mouthfeel, wonderful complexity.   A minor quibble may be that adding so much malt doesnt accentuate the vanilla notes of the oak - it tends to overwhelm them.   But theyre there, and the whole thing works quite well together.    Very nice.","Fircrest, Washington, USA","marctacoma"

Heres the overriding concern: the flavor never develops.  It starts out tasting like brandied dark strong beer, stays that way in the mid-palate, and finishes like brandied dark strong beer.  The tartness of the brandy wood just permeates any caramel, apple, spice character that the base beer had - frankly I think the base beer is too weak to be aged, and wouldnt be surprised to learn that it is flavorless (an overwrought dubs IPA masquerading as a BW) to begin with.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"

Rich sweet malts that tell a take of dark fruits mixing with vanilla and caramel. Everything is well-blended and cohesive. The flavors roll over the tongue smoothly and leave a lasting impression. The booze appears only faintly and in no way takes away from the beauty of the beer, even at the end when its room temperature. There is spice and more depth of character than I would have expected.

3054,"2009-02-13",4.6,"750ml bottle, 2007 brandy-barrel vintage courtesy of Weibull, thanks! I have been looking forward to this beer and my birthday seemed as good a day as any to pop this bottle. The color is a real nice dark-brown with red edges and a nice foam that dissolves into a smattering of off-white bubbles ringing the glass. It looks good! The aroma is very oaky, woody, and boozy with some vanilla. This sounds weird but the smell reminds me of Oaked Yeti but there is also just the hint of cognac. The flavor is pretty exceptional the moment it passes the lips. It is woody, more booze and sweet syrups abound. Wow, the flavor is also kind of hard to pin down as I am tasting different flavors with each sip, and odd gum flavor like Blackjack and candy. Perfect silky mouth-feel but the drink-ability is oddly not hampered by the ABV and the beer is boozy (in a very good way). This is a very complex tasting beer and if I was more articulate I would tell you why. Instead, all I can say is that if you like barrel-aged beers, seek this out, its tasty. The complexity of the flavor is helpful, aiding the drink-ability making you want to keep sipping and get blasted with a new taste. I had to bump the drinkability score, no problem drinking the whole bottle.

3054,"2009-01-16",4.2,"750ml bottle.  2007.  I drank a bottle of this about a two months ago at my wedding.  I had never had it before and thought it was excellent.  Was going to save this for a year or so because I thought it could stand the time and possibly improve.  After reading numerous reports that this was infected/went bad I figured I better open up my second bottle in case I wasnt so lucky.  Thankfully this one is not infected.

Pours dark brown/black, certainly the darkest Barleywine Ive ever seen.  A small off-white head is small and has pour retention.  A circle of bubbles and some inner swirls remain but carbonation is on the low end.  Red hues around the rim are visible in front of the light but this very dark.  Aroma shows chocolate, graham crackers, smore.  Graham cracker sticks out the most and is probably the most intense graham cracker Ive ever encountered in a beer.  A toastiness/freshly baked bread component is also noticeable in the nose.  Very interesting and unique aroma.  Vanilla and oak incredibly subtle in the smell, Brandy Im not sure is there at all.  Chocolate bread is about the best I could describe this smell, though it is more appetizing than that description implies.

The flavor is fruity, a teeny bit tart, vinous, wine-like with some oakiness, and a touch of alcohol flavor and some brandy/caramel sweetness.  Wood notes in there as well though they are faint.  The fruit is cherry and red grape, slightly tart and interesting, could be from the brandy.  Though the flavor has a sweetness to it the beer itself is not very thick or chewy, it goes down well and is certainly not cloying.  A nice alcohol warmth is present and pleasant.  If there were no worries of infection or anything of the like I hold by my opinion that this could age for at least another year or two.  I would like to try the 06 version and the bourbon barrel version as well.  From the two samples Ive had of this vintage I am impressed.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Good, but I think I like the bourbon better.  
Bottle.  Pour is a beautiful mahogany brown with bubbles on the surface but little head.  Aromas are thick with apples, grape jelly and junk... so I begin to wonder if this is infected.  Pushing on, though, there are slightly sour fruit flavors from apples and raisins, but things fall apart from here.  Alcohol and flavors dont match, barrel aging is detectable, but seems out of place, strange sour notes are not good...

Been looking for this for quite a while and couldnt wait to pop the cork. It pours dark, dark brown with hints of mahogany showing through the edges. The head was bubbly and short lived and left only traces of lacing.

The aroma is huge and complex, and it really opened up as the beer warmed a little. There are tons of dark fruits in there with figs and raisins on top of a brown sugar sweetness. There is some vanilla and brandy as well.

The sweetness of the aroma carries over to the taste with the caramel malts and brown sugar underpinning everything else. Dark fruits, vanilla and a slightly more noticeable brandy presence than the aroma suggests.

The mouthfeel is slick and almost syrupy with little carbonation.

3054,"2008-11-29",4.3,"Thanks to Logan for a taste of this at the Pizza Port Carlsbad last month.  I’m not sure of the vintage but given the aged flavor profile I’d say 2006.  Pours a dark chestnut brown with a very thin, fine off-white head.  Lots of molasses and golden raisins in the aroma with a touch of caramel and spicy hops in the background.  Brandy, and barrel-aged characteristics are present and well-integrated into the overall aroma, occassionally offering a peak of boozeyness or woodiness.  The flavor has lots of acidity, surprisingly, that gives this beer an amazing vibrancy and regulates thick, earthy flavor profile that isn’t overly sweet or malty for a barley wine of this size (and is what leads me to guess that this is the 2006 batch).  All this gives the impression of dark plum fruitiness--with some aspect of the skins as well.  There’s plenty of alcohol and a lot of structure in the body that creates a multi-dimensional mouth feel that highlights and delivers various aspects of the flavor in different ways across the palate.  A very interesting, alternative take on barleywine.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"
3054,"2008-11-21",4.6,"<i>A Mes rate: 2007 bottle, thanks to the absolute LEGEND that is MikeTD.</i>You all know this is good. I knew it was good too but I really didn’t know quite how good. Stright out of the bottle it looks pretty close to perfection. Almost black mahogany with a good tan head and attractive spotty lacing. The nose is sublime. So rich and full and certainly one of the most complex smelling beers I have experienced. Incredible, i n c r e d i b l e malt, amazing herbs, red wine of immense quality, chocolate and liquorice are pretty much a given but they are stunning, in fact the chocolate is more like fresh cocoa. The tart barrelly notes are beyond compare and coupled with a perfect level of sweetness, this is just an incredibly noseable beer. It may have been a hard act to follow but the flavour is equally stunning. To me it’s the finish that really sets it apart.  The longer it stays in the mouth (and believe me it stays for what seems like a week) the more the tart and barrel notes increase. It’s simply a very high quality experience. All the beautiful rich malt from the aroma is there but it is balanced by some intense tartness, a little acidity and a finish crafted by angels. It’s one hell of a ride. A feeling of being beaten to a pulp by Anderson Silva yet at the same time being caressed by a goddess. There is just so much to love about this beer. It’s been said before, but it’s worth saying again, Mike you seriously kick arse.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

Incredibly smooth flavor of liqueur-saturated oak wood, toasted cinnamon-bread and fruitcake. The palate is nothing short of perfect with the extra age on it.

It is not as sweet and brandy-like now and the sourness has really become dominate. Sweet malt, carmel, liquor filled chocolates, slight oak/barrel, brandy, sour, funkiness from barrel aging (oxidation). The palate is medium bodied, with  a slight alcohol burn, and a clinging finish. For an 11.5% abv this beer goes down easily, maybe too easily.

3054,"2008-09-21",4.4,"2006 edition: Eclipsed garnet. Thin light-beige head slowly diminishes into a jagged-edged collar. Fabulously aromatic notes of fresh-cut wood (sawdust, clay),  blackcurrants, candied plums, meaty molasses, vanilla, nougat, and old leather entice the senses. Soft pricks of carbonation. Viscous barrel extractives evoke thoughts of blackstrap molasses and liquefied raisins as they lap the palate. Clean but pervasive alcohol disperses some of the tackiness from the tongue while the relaxed tannins lend balance by simultaneously stinging the palate gently. Exquisitely balanced despite the overall intensity of each component. Seamless interplay between the bright fruity esters and dense concentration of brandy. Takes on a tolerable blackstrap molasses, leather, and lightly medicinal astringency toward the center. Very tacky and sugary, though never remotely cloying or nauseating in its unbridled richness. Gorgeously textured, core-bolstering malts gradually intensify to reveal deeply rooted vanilla-cake accents which harmonize with the understated, yet vibrant, vanillin oakiness. Although a hint of cardboard exudes, it is surprisingly minimal, and the faint remnants of oxidation are mostly absorbed by the dizzyingly complex and sophisticated medley of malt, esters, and sappy brandy. Absolutely supple beyond compare. Tongue-coating and tooth-clinging on up to finish which features a sweet and salty fusion of tannins and red licorice coupled with undercurrents of leather and coffee. Didnt expect to be all that fond of this, but theyve clearly outdone themselves here. Beers of this nature are rarely so refined.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Pours deep, redish brown with a great, small, creamy, beige head on top - truly a beauty to behold. Good duration on the head.

3054,"2008-07-06",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2011 4 oz taste at the Seattle IBF. Something special, for sure. Pours a deep, dark cola brown with a thick, dense head. First impression on the aroma was roasty sweet malts, with notes of brandy, oak, deep malts and just enough hops to counter the depth of the brew. Taste is like a fine blend of a Belgian quad / brown ale (think SB Abt. 12 meets Nostradamus), with prominent notes of chocolate, brandy, dark fruits (figs, dates), a bit of smoke (perhaps going as far as coffee), caramel and cloves. More than anything, I noticed how my mouth kept salivating with each sip - it coated thoroughly and left me wanting more. Heavily carbonated, and a decent alcohol burn (our bottle was labeled 12.5%). By far the best Lost Abbey effort Ive tasted, and I feel lucky to have been able to try it. Wonderful stuff. RERATE 03/20/10: On tap at Brouwers Hard Liver 2010. Tasted next to the bourbon version. I have to say, I dont like Angels nearly as much as I once did. Its hot, and just too much of a palate bomb. I can appreciate the complexity, but this one is definitely overhyped. Im dropping my rating by 0.3 - 0.1 for palate, and 0.2 overall. RERATE 03/05/11: I have to knock a few more points off this one. Its just simply too boozy, and for whatever reason, I *feel* this one more than I do any other beer. Every time I have one, Im done... which doesnt happen after a World Wide Stout, so something is awry. Im to the point where the novelty of Angels Share has disappeared, and Im just no longer a fan. I can appreciate the complexity, but Im over it.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

3054,"2008-05-22",4.2,"12.7 oz bottle from South Bay Drugs.  What a treat to have this available at a local spot.  I was saving it for when I had a lot of time to spend drinking it and studying it and now was my time.  The nose was a sweet blend of caramel and sugary malt with an unbelievable fresh scent of wood. The wood kind of reminded me of woodshop or a freight carrying a whole cargo of cut trees. The flavor was similar to syrup and hid the alcohol content to a well masked factor during the drink. The pour created vigorous head which I didnt expect and in part I lost a few ounces since I couldnt control the abruption of the bottle, but I admired its view while it rested in my glass.

Incredibly long duration from each sip (30+ seconds of intense flavor). Strong oak presence towards the finish, warming as well.

Bits of raisin, alcohol, plums, and cake batters.  In sight of the summit of barrel aging of any type, if not reaching it.  Little wink of tartness in the oak flavor here; beside the beautiful irish cream texture and balanced honey sweetness, a bit of pear and dried fig simmered in maple syrup lends a soft touch of outdoorsy, tangy fire-baked fruit character.  Brazen smokiness and reduced-jam sugariness, seeming just a bit young.  Cocoa dusted pineapple, apricot, chocolate liqueur; a bit of dry wine and spirit alcohol drying out in the mid palate.

3054,"2008-04-05",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2011 Re-rate, draft @ Cheeky Monk in Denver. Comes nearly black, with an espresso-like head that is pink-tinged tan. Aroma is tremendous. It is the kind of aroma that begs of contemplation, and for which words can do no real justice. The predominant character is a caramelized chocolate graham cracker cookie crust cake bottom. It is a lot like the chocolate crumbly bottom of ice cream cake. The body is silky smooth, and unbelievably creamy for such a strong beer. In tandem with the flavors, the palate has a mascarpone quality. The alcohol thins and dries the palate. But there is also a natural acidity that accomplishes the same thing. And there are also late tannins on the scene, as if raw oak was used for conditioning. So the beer is never too sweet, in spite of being dessert-like. The cookie crumb flavors never become cloying in the least, and the Bing black cherry and raspberry flavors never become tart. It all comes together in a harmonious fruition. A mature, sophisticated nightcap that is fabulous to behold.

3054,"2008-03-12",4.1,"High expectations always precede the Port brewers, and Angels Share was perhaps at the highest level. The pour is a great surprise, almost stoutish in hue, its black depth is set ablaze by maroon contours and a creamy dark foam that recedes rapidly. The nose shows an obvious maturity, a complex amalgam minutely arranged. Darkness imbues the essence of this brew, from the dried figs, prunes, raisins and cranberries to the deep caramel and molasses. Oak and its vanillin are notable influences of the barrel aging, as are the hints of whiskey. Dusty cocoa powder is apparent, added to cherry, hazelnut and grape bubblegum. Unfortunately whiskey becomes almost obtrusive on the palate, particularly as it melds with an alcoholic heat present throughout the experience. The sweet, somewhat sticky mouthfeel reminds of toffee, cubeb pepper, anise and mint. It is a powerful brew yet the complexity is delicate and the texture surprisingly creamy and soft. A rich Carambar-like caramel flavor lends a strong malt backbone supplemented by Nutella and highlighted by tonalities of plum, vanilla, licorice and even banana. The Angels Share is a vigorous effort that nonetheless retains thoughtfulness and balance. The long complex aftertaste is a testament to the impressive technique of the brewers, but when all is said and done, I wish the barrel aging had not been so overpowering as I always like to see a beer speak for itself.

This is a dark beer in the snifter, with reddish brown hues only coming through at the bottom of the glass.  The beige bubbles could only manage a galaxy shaped whisp and a ring.  This is one of those beers that you could smell for hours.  Dark fruit, raisen, oak, vanilla, alcohol, and caramel.  The alcohol sneaks up on you like a velvet hammer.  The flavor is a wonderful combination of the toffee, caramel, and chocolate marshmellow sweetness.  This is a classic combination of the wood and alcohol with a first rate barley wine.  Vanilla, oak, dark fruits, toffee and burnt caramel sweetness.   This beer kicked my ass, Ill admit.  One bottle is not necessarily a single serving.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

Poured a dark cola brown with a small to medium light brown head; darker compared to most of the style.  Aroma of dark fruit/figs, caramel chews, vanilla, oak and some light roasted elements.  Full palate with a rather soft presence on the palate indicating a nice and minimal amount of carbonation.  A plethora of flavors emerged with each sip.  Definitely a beer to be sipped, but the alcohol was not too assertive for my liking.  Flavors included roasted malt, caramel (especially initially), dark fruit, vanilla, alcohol, with some general sweetness.  Overall this was fantastic, and only Behemoth keeps it from being my favorite barleywine.  A bottle of this is coming to kleyland and KieferUGA in Georgia shortly.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"
3054,"2007-12-23",4.0,"Very dark brown, almost black.  Light tan head with a ring around the glass, no lacing left behind.  Smell of brandy, figs, prunes, vanilla; quite sweet.  Brandy and some oak greet the tongue intitially, leading into vanillia, figs, and dark fruits.  Thicker than medium body, with carbonation on the lower side.  Solid beer, but not exactly what I thought it might be.  Perhaps some age will develop it more.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"
3054,"2007-12-23",4.5,"Incredible. Pours a caramel brown, almost opaque with a thick creamy head and contiuous lacing. Nose is big brandy at first followed by caramel, chocolate, dark fruits and if taken in altogether without picking them out it smells like plain yogourt. Big brandy up front but not boozy whatsoever. Chocolate, brown sugar, caramel and dark fruits all take their turn on your pallate then a smooth as silk brandy finish. Insanely drinkable and I couldnt detect half the abv. A world class libation.","Columbus, Maryland, USA","franksnbeans"
3054,"2007-12-15",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 29, 2009 Nov 07 release.  750ml.  Deep brown body, nearly black, with a dark tan or brown head.  Nose of tobacco, plum, port, brandy, light butter and light wine grape note.   Silky, full, thick body, vinous.  A bit of roast and wood tannins pop up,more of a buttery note with some plum, wood and buttery sherry/wine flavors.  Well-formed and complete, I can imagine it being smoother but overall Im impressed.  I often am not so much a fan of Lost Abbeys big beers, but I find more in this one than any other.  Excellent stuff.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3054,"2007-12-12",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2009 2007 vintage consumed Oct 08. Pours murky brown with garnet edges and thin near mocha head. The moderate aroma brings smooth oakiness to the fore followed by musty dark fruity esters of figs, dates and some building yet in check alcohol heat on a big draw. The taste is a pleasing mix of dark fruity esters of muted dark grapes, figs, prunes and dates to go along with smooth oakiness and a ribbon of caramel. Yum, smooth blended and stunningly good. Throughout theres a river of mild brandy notes. 

Tapped right out of the cask into serving vessels and then into my glass at the Lost Abbey Barrel Tasting event 8/25/07. This was the standard offering. Pours dark brown and not at all see through. The aroma is fruity with plums, dates, raisins and a hint of olives and wood. The first impression of the taste is the sweetness just comes up and hits with sweet fruits like raisins, dates, prunes and olives. A sweet wood to vanilla note grows toward the finish. Theres a twist of sweet citrus hard candy and an unmistakable Belgian yeast notes. The hard alcohol seems to shine through from the barrel aging and adds to some of the dryness.

Tapped right out of the cask into serving vessels and then into my glass at the Lost Abbey Barrel Tasting event 8/25/07. This was the previously unreleased version with 18 months of age in Brandy Barrels. Pours a dark dark coffee like brown color that is much darker than the standard Angles Share. The aroma is wood oakiness and hints of booze. It is tough to discern the other mixture of notes in the nose. The complexity can be broken up into subtle fruity notes that are blended well enough that their tough to distinguish. The flavor has suitable levels of both oak and booze as well as undercurrents of sweet dark fruit. Toward the finish a nice caramel note wells up to further complex the flavor. Very nice indeed and ends somewhat dry.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
3054,"2007-12-12",3.9,"Huge thanks to MikeTD for flying to Cali for (this bottle) family. Dark burgundy pour, very tiny beige head. Aroma is boozy, lots of oak, vanilla. Flavor is mellow bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, and a touch of roastiness. Belgian style yeast that would be in say a quad. A touch of raisens, caramel and a hint of coffee as it warms. More roastiness as it warms with the booze really mellowing out. Cloying mouthfeel but thin carbonation.","Brook Park, Ohio, USA","crizay"

3054,"2007-12-06",4.8,"Repeal Day. Time to pull out all stops. I dont have a Port or Lost Abbey glass so my Westvleteren chalice will have to suffice.

A: Dark brown ruby colored body. It almost looks like a very dark red wine sitting in the glass. Barely enough light passes through to be able to see yeast particles in suspension but I can just make them out. There was initially a small light mocha colored head but it fell soon after pouring leaving only a rim on the edge and a small patch in the center. Fairly typical of a barrel aged beer in my experience. By swirling the glass it seems that the beer is pretty thin but I know better than to judge a book by its cover. There is almost no visible carbonation.

S: As soon as I popped the cork I could smell brandy. Smelling the beer itself is a magnification of the cork. Brandy, sweet caramel, toffee, vanilla, and dark fruits emanate from the glass. I have never smelled caramel so clearly before in a beer and it smells damn good. Overall, it may be a bit on the sweet end but if so, only by the slimmest of margins.

T: The brandy is very up front but not overpowering. Broken down, I get some caramel, dark chocolate, oak, and a great malt backbone. The caramel is as strong in the flavor as it was in the aroma. The chocolate appears later in the taste joined by a hint of dark fruit and they linger on the tongue, lasting nicely into the aftertaste. There is a slight bitterness in the middle that appears only for an instant before fading into the dark chocolate. As it warms, the flavors become enhanced and richer without becoming too much. If I didnt know this was 11% ABV, I could call you a liar if you told me so. I cant detect any alcoholic burn at all. The smoothness of this beer is out of this world.

M: The body is actually much thinner than I expected, but there is so much flavor packed in there it doesnt even matter. As I mentioned, the smoothness is amazing. It tastes like this should be a sipping beer, but I ended up finishing the first glass rather quickly.

D: There was a decent amount of hype surrounding this beer as there is surrounding Dark Lord. When I finally tried Dark Lord for the first time, I was a bit disappointed. Tasting The Angels Share for the first time was the exact opposite. This beer is as good as, if not better than the hype as far as Im concerned. The ease of drinking for a beer of this ABV is incredible and the flavor profile is outstanding. This really is a world class beer.","Troy, New York, USA","drseamus"
3054,"2007-12-06",4.7,"Bottle (750ml).  At BeerBistro - shared with blankboy.  Batch 1.  Rating #2700.  Poured murky dark reddish-brown, with a smallish mottled tan creamy/bubbly head.  The aroma is wonderful - smooth and complex and certainly no complaints at all, apart from it being a tad too restrained - I got, variously, well-rounded funky yeast, smooth, lightly chocolatey caramel malt, soft, rich spice, with raisins and citrus zest, and an overall blanketing of downy-soft oak/vanilla tannins.  The taste - wow.  Just wow.  Barleywine is now done for me, I dont expect to taste better, ever - smooth, roast caramel malt, quite sweet with dusty rosehip highlights and mocha, the alcohol reminded me of armanac, and there is even a whisper of floral hops lingering in there, as well as raisins and ... look, its just Fin good, okay?  thick, soft, lightly sugary mouthfeel, a joy on the palate - nice sludge at the bottom too (yumm), and it got increasingly warming - drink this with a friend, but not hot, not boozy.  Splended, sophisticated, wonderful - I dont know how long this was cellared, but with THIS age on it, this is an amazing experience - I described it after the fact as ""like being beaten to death with a solid gold bar wrapped in chinchilla.""","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
3054,"2007-12-04",4.4,"Bottle shared at the Beer Bistro in Toronto. Gotta splurge sometimes! Dark murky beer with minimal head. Nose is off dark chocolates and fruit- not what I expected for a barleywine! Taste- sublime- the brandy aging has turned this into a very unique beer. Hops are subdued, so really not that much bitterness. Just silky thick tootsie roll, plums and raisins, and vanilla sweetness (to name a few). Almost seems like more Belgian Quad than barleywine. Great sipping beer, but still dangerously drinkable. No hotness to speak of, just pure heaven.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","oakbluff"
3054,"2007-12-03",4.0,"750ml bottle, batch 1, cellar aged 1 year, BLIND!!  Part of ""Drewbeerme is crazy mofo for having me rate this blind"" tasting.  Dark brown, opaque color and small to medium beige head.  Sour chocolate aroma with old fruit and al very slight (after finding out what this beer was, I can attribute a lot of what I was smelling to the aging process, including vanilla and alc).  Nice flavor of sour roast, bitter fruit, boozy, chocolate, (once again a lot of what I was getting could have been from the barrel-aging, especially some of the char/dark malt taste and alc).  Body is a little thin for all of the flavors that are going on, but none the less very creamy, though I could live without the burn.  Overall a very nice beer, and I dig the age flavors that were already coming out at a year, I would love to try it again after a few years (hint hint nudge nudge Andrew).

Nearly opaque dark mahogany body with a mild, frothy, tan/yellow head with nice legging.  Head is a bit too small and retention is not overly fortuitous.  Sweet, raisiny, fruity start, which has some bourbon flavors before a nice, leathery, tobacco, roasted, chocolate maltiness in the middle.  Finishes with some light piney hop bitterness.

Sometimes one encounters a highly rated beer only to be disappointed in the end. This was simply not the case. It ranks among the best beers Ive enjoyed in the last 12 months. The mouthfeel is fabulous, viscous and rich, and sometimes one feels as if they are chewing an artisan caramel toffee candy. Notes of vanilla, sour cherry, plum, ginger, soy, and brown sugar dominate. It reminded me somewhat of Sam Adams Triple Bock in its flavor profile, yet without the harshness of that beer.

3054,"2007-11-12",3.9,"A deep copper tint with slight garnet reflects. Bold and impressive nose with strong American identity, minus the cleanliness. Pretty yeasty and estery, but obviously even more so malty. Barrel influence remains restrained, though clearly responsible for the smoky notes. Full on the slick grape, plum, toasted bread, maple-like, chocolatey, vanilla laden malts, supported by a mellow wooden base. Sweet and potent all along, yet not so heady as I would have expected. Despite its active and dynamic fruitiness, I cant call it vinous, it is too cerealic for that. Well integrated, rather velvety body never gets cloying and for an exception, its sojourn in the barrel may be partly responsible for the graceful thinning of the final product. Very solid and not so pretentious as many, not pushing an element forward, but striving for heavy balance.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

3054,"2007-11-11",4.5,"Ok time to sample one of the bottles I scored at the latest release of this. Pours a very dark brown, much darker and Id have to say black. A small brown head fizzes up then fades away. Aroma is a huge mix of flavors, caramel, vanilla, a big smack of sweet molasses, brandy, and oak! I was a bit nervous before my first sip cuz this thing smelled boozy as hell too. However, the alcohol is VERY well hidden once you take a sip. In fact, I couldnt get over all of the tastes going on. More caramel and molasses of course but there is much more. Brandy comes together with dark fruits and sweet chocolate to blend into a wonderful and smooth flavor. The oak is very present in this beer and really is a very nice touch. Also, I dont know what brandy was in these barrels previously but there seems to be a peach-like flavor going on. Just a thought. Tomme, Gina, Damien, and all the rest out there at Losty Abbey/ Port Brewing really know how to make some amazing beer, they certainly have a winner here. Very pleased that I have more bottles to visit in the future. My rating may go up after I put this down for a year or so!

Side Note: Make sure you drink this cool, not cold. I tried this way too cold with my first sip and it was awful and harsh. Let this baby breathe for 30 minutes after you pull it from the fridge before you enjoy. A whole new world lit up for me. Cheers!","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","rayg1"

3054,"2007-11-03",4.6,"(Bottle, thanks WeeHeavySD) Pours very dark brown with deep reddish hints and a light brown head. Elegant and complex aroma with tones of chocolate, caramel, nuts, English toffee, English fruit cake, lingonberries, blackberries maybe some blueberry and strawberry jam and a wide subtle fruit spectra of raisins, plums, sweet pears, yellow apples and banana in the background. The oak wood blends in very well with soft tones of vanilla, cocoa nut and some butter. Also some hints of yeast, sugar, spices, peppery mint and sal ammoniac. Well balanced alcohol warmth carrying every aroma beautifully. The nose is extremely soft with notes of gruel. The flavour starts of with a second of chocolate, coffee and dark fruit. Then a rather full caramelly and fruity sweetness comes along with some fiery alcohol. The finish carries all the sweetness with a balanced sour berry touch. Oak, vanilla and some subtle sugar sources goes through every stage of the beer. Undertones of dark berries and dark fruits like raisins and black currant lemonade. Hints of liquorice, salt and hops. Medium to full sweet and syrupy with a light tart edge. Light bitter and light dry. The mouthfeel is maybe the best ever with a silky, smooth and velvety character. The carbonation is perfect for the mouthfeel and carries the beer gentle down your palate. Sugar, chocolate, vanilla, salty liquorice and some earthiness linger in the aftertaste. Near full bodied.

The head starts out a fat two-fingers in height and is frothy, rich amber tinged, dark tan color.  Quite barrel influenced; some fruity, brandy-like notes are noticeable at first (including some slightly hot notes, that seem alcohol induced, but are really from the oak character).  The nose soon picks up notes of oak-derived vanillin, touches of butterscotch and some spicy oak notes.  The underlying beer is still noticeable though throughout all of this, though it does play a secondary, supporting role; aromatic notes of deeply caramelized malt sugars, some chalky cocoa notes, touches of toasty malt / dark bread, hints of dark grain notes (chocolate and something like Special B malt) and some fruit notes which meld with some probable brandy-induced aromas.  The combination of the brandy & malt produce aromatic notes of raisins, a touch of cherry and some dried fig character.  At times the aroma has me convinced that a mix of vanilla & hazel nut extracts has been added to the brew, or at least it seems that way.  This is a very nice aroma, while it is certainly highly barrel influenced, it is not so much that it is detracting for me.  I could wish that a bit more richness of the base beer came through though.

Soft, creamy, malt textures up front yield to a light spritz provided by the carbonation, but the beer really doesnt lose that creamy texture.  In fact the malts cling to the palate, even coating the mouth in their velvety touch even after the beer has left my mouth.  As I was sort of expecting, the oak plays the secondary role in the flavor to the combination of beer & brandy flavors (opposite to the aromas balance).  The malt & brandy contribute a nice level of fruit character here, including notes of concentrated raisins, figs, and a very slight cherry note.  The fruit notes seem to be slightly roasted in character; the dark malts used here contribute a slightly chalky roast grain character, touches of chocolate & really something that seems like burnt raisins.  The oak really provides an incredible balance & contrast to the flavors of this brew.  As the beer warms, flavors of sweet nut extracts start to become quite prominent; touches of hazelnut, almond and something much like amaretto become quite pronounced and enjoyable.

The oak flavors are very well integrated here; soft notes of vanillin are noticeable at times, and towards the middle through to the end is noticeable a subtle butterscotch note.  Spicy oak flavors are noticeable throughout, but especially show up in the finish; in combination with the hop bitterness, these notes provide a balance to the sweet malt & fruit notes.  I get the feeling that this beer has a nice hop influence to it, but for some reason (other than the fair amount of bitterness) I cant separate these contributions out from the rest of the competing flavors.  As the beer warms up, the vanilla flavors really become much more prominent.

While I was expecting this to be at least good, I really am impressed how good this really is.  This beer really works quite well with the brandy barrel.  This is truly and enjoyable sipping brew, as the label states, 750ml is definitely a good size for slowly sipping & savoring amongst friends.  I really like the flavors found in this brew as well as the silky textures of the body / mouthfeel; the two really compliment each other quite well.  I cant actually imagine the texture of this beer being any better for this particular set of flavors.  I really think more brewers need to explore this particular barrel type, as I just transferred a bunch of a Belgian-style Quad from a Heaven Hill Brandy barrel (same type of barrel used here I believe), that is shaping up to be quite phenomenal as well.  Speaking of which, the brandy character really seems to move this beer into the realm of a strong, dark, Belgian beer like a Quad; ultimately, I think this is why I like this beer so much, barrel & barley wine did not really excite me that much, but little did I realize that the combination would evoke the complexity & fruit character that I like so much in a really good Quad.   Quite surprisingly (at least to this lover of funky beers), this is easily, objectively (removing the situational aspect) the best beer I have ever had from Tomme.  I really wish I had at least a couple more bottles of this batch as I have a feeling it is going to age quite well.  Without the barrel character (brandy & oak derived), this beer would merely be at most good and more like just decent; really it is the marriage of all of the components of this brew that make it so incredible.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3054,"2007-10-12",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2008 Pours watery-caramel colored with very slight tan head.  Aroma is hugely brandy and dark fruit, caramel, oak.  Taste is slightly harsh and overwhelmingly brandy.  Actually, overwhelms the barley wine aspects of the beer initially, but does develop some deeper complexity after a few sips.  Very nice.
---- Re-rate bottle: 11/20/2007
Much better impressions of this beer after having it in the bottle versus the GABF version.
The  brandy is much more smooth and blends very well with the English Barley Wine aspects of this beer.  
I still think that it is predominantly a boozy beer, but it works so well on this one.  As if the beer was made as a base to showcase the brandy aging.  
Very smooth, caramel, sweet brandy.  
Finishes slightly boozy, but not overwhelmingly so.  
Just very, very well balanced in its flavors.","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"

Thanks, illinismitty.  What can I say other than this is one absofrigginlutely good drink.  Pours an opaque black with a small beige head.  Luscious aroma of caramel malts, bourbon, vanilla, oak, molasses, balsamic reduction, and ripe berries.  Full-bodied with a sticky, syrupy feel.  The flavor was just magnificent.  All the aromatic essences working together for a sweet yet robust and satisfying taste producing an esophageal warmth as it is swallowed.  As balanced as it is complex.  This is something Id love to keep drinking now and also stash a case or two away to see what happens.  Excellent. One of my favorite barleywines was the no longer existing Dogwood Excellent Adventure.  This surpasses that and is ""available.""","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
3054,"2007-09-03",4.8,"Bottle, a very damn expensive one, shared at Beer Bistro with my good friend Big Red, who bought it as a bday gift - many many thanks man!!  Very dark brown/black, creamy off white brownish head - looks great (this is a barleywine?).  Aroma was stunning - complex roast, hops, alcohol, oak, vanilla, charcoal, spice - I could go on, but this thing was a great treat for the old sniffer.  Taste - man, thats good stuff - lots of vanilla and oak mixed with alcohol and sweet malt.  Dessert sweet.    Some peat seeps in there as well, but just a bit.  I still have a hard time imagining this as a Barleywine (blind, I would have said an imperial stout - I think).  In any case, is it incredibly complex and contemplative - if I was ever going to drink a $56 beer, Im glad it was this - stunning.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"

3054,"2007-07-14",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2007 Bottle. Ratebeer Christmas in Oshawa, December 2007. I believe it was indicated that this was recently released version? Very dark brown body with a modest creamy tan head (3+). Lightly woody character is my first impression of the aroma, sweet underlying malt, 
dark fruit notes. Wood brings a touch of alcohol with it and then later a moderate amount of vanilla as the glass warms up. The flavour starts out a touch rough, partly due to wood and alcohol character, and partly due to the realization that it does not taste the same as my last sample. Sweet malt follows behind that initial impression. Somewhat dry alcoholic finish leaves a warming glow in the mouth with a boozy finish. Medium palate has low carbonation. Not sure if the beer is different or if I am, but this was just pretty good, where the last sample was superb, and it is a fairly large disappointment because of that. 8/3+/8/3/16-17 - 4.0

(8+) Flavour is likewise quite malty with just enough bitterness and alcohol presence to balance the sweetness. Lingering tangy malt with note of bitterness and gloriousness I like the verbiage to elaborate on at this time. Creamy smooth palate floats on the tongue. Whispers of anise in the aftertaste.  I eventually gave up trying to keep my notes up with my thought process and finished with ""F**K YEAH!"" First beer to knock my socks off like this in a long time!

Very dark for the style, but thats not a problem for me.  It looked almost like a porter, with a cream, tan head.

Started off with prunes and the first alcoholic effluves were spicy like a fruitcake, then as it warmed the fusels came out a bit more, giving it a powerful aroma that oscillated between a fine Kirschwasser and a cask strenght whiskey. Whoh.

Quite rich but never going overboard, the barrel-aging is just at the right level where Brandy and Rhum flavors are present but without draining out the body. The booze flavor is there but without the burning or harshness you can find sometimes, only a nice warm feeling in the throat at the very end. The body is quite malty and easy to drink, even at near room temp. Surprising how it can seem so simple in one sip, then throw you for a loop the next.

3054,"2007-06-12",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2008 Thick tan froth totally covers a rich looking, ultra-dark burgundy body. Deep within lie swirls of brown that look like the mouth of a soil-choked river. Gorgeous, with thick lacing that resembles storm clouds about to unleash a torrential downpour. Absolutely the most menacing barleywine Ive ever beheld. The aroma is bloated with a symphony of chocolate and dark berries. Totally stitchless melding of nuances that captivate and entangle my nose and mind. The fruit notes seem as though dried fruits were used, with hints of sun-soaked blackberries and sticky crumpled raspberries. Oak wafts in and sits steadily atop the fruit, releasing wave after booming wave of vanilla and spice. This is completely overdone, over aged and I absolutely adore it. Alcohol is moderate and adds to the complexity of the nose. The malt is caramel rich, with lesser jabs at chocolate icing and toasty bread. So far, simply marvelous. The flavor is much the same, with additions of fresh but cooled coffee, molasses, raisins and apricot. Very sweet immediately and throughout, the flavor doesnt even bring to mind the slightest nudging of cloying taste. Bitterness is shielded from easy interpretation by gargantuan fruitiness and steadily warming alcohol. Late in the quaff, alcohol drying begins to take hold. Vanilla grows in evidence at a steady and comparable rate. Tannic acidity grips the corners of the cheeks and beckons the sweet nectar to parade in an orderly fashion quietly down the center of my tongue. This is a really fun barleywine to sip, though its just as fun to take gigantic gulps; it definitely goes down far too easy. the finish is mildly warming, sweet then dry and fruity with vanilla overtones. The mouthfeel is stunning: extremely full-bodied, viscous but never too sticky, appropriately carbonated and unyielding in its ferocity. Miles ahead of any barrel aged barleywine Ive ever had the pleasure to drink.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

3054,"2007-06-08",4.8,"UPDATED: AUG 24, 2008 My Bottom Line:
This Saint amongst Barley Wines miraculously morphs chocolate, caramel and berries into the most sensuous of malty maidens. As soon as it begs for intimacy, a whiskied spirit materializes to impregnate with its vanilla wisdom, and the heavenly consummation stops an entire moment dead in its tracks.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A cloak of foam tops the darkest burgundy.
-Although this is a big barley wine, the body is never obese or even sticky (à la J.W.Lees Harvest Ale or Kuhnhenns BB Barley Wine, which I still love).
-Carbonation is perfectly calculated; I would almost say this is a very drinkable malt monster.
-The multifarious fruitiness takes flight on the sweet maltiness, an ever so graceful duo.
-A few sips into it, I dont feel like analyzing anymore. I just want to indulge and grin, in silence.
-This is as complex and heavenly as the Bourbon Barrel version. Both include their respective barrels seamlessly and provide a wealth of flavors and titillations.

3054,"2007-05-28",4.2,"750 ml. Trade with awaisanan. Thanks Andy. Very dense dark brown color with quick dissipating brown head. Aroma of Tobacco, Vanilla and Bourbon not Brandy. All very palatable and well mixed and balanced. Alcohol well hidden and very full bodied without being viscous or sticky. 
For a very long time the taste was hauntingly familiar. Pannepot no not spicy enough. Brasserie des Rocs no not sharp enough. Gouden Carolus Cuvee Van de Keizer no not sticky sweet enough. Then it hit me it was the overpowering Tobacco taste very similar to Fred from the Wood except much better and much more substance. Is there something with Barleywines and wood that give it a Tobacco taste. 
The Tobacco taste was not one dimensional like FFTW because it was balanced with a Delicious Caramel taste. If you have every made your own Caramel for homemade caramel ice cream it is exactly the same. 
A great beer with a cigar. Tatuaje Cojonu Figurado. 
All in all a good to great beer but not exceptional as the Tobacco taste takes away the Barleywine flavors I enjoy.","scottsdale, Arizona, USA","footy"
3054,"2007-05-27",4.3,"Small taste (too small, in my opinion) at GABF 2006.  Dark, translucent reddish hue...medium tan head.  Big nose....full of sweet plummy, raisiny fruitiness.  It really grabbed me.  Big full-bodied vanilla malty sweetness was very intense...light brandy, toffee, brown sugar edge is great.  Big alcoholic warmth toward the end.  Creamy mouthfeel is a delight.   Wow, this one works you to the end.  I need a bottle of this stuff...well, ok, I dont need it, but sure would enjoy it!  Great brew.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"
3054,"2007-05-27",4.5,"Deep chocolate amber and slightly translucent with icy, galaxy tan sheafs spreading across the head. Lovely, beady cascading lace. Aroma channels straight to heaven. Caramelized beets, brandy butter, bourbon and rye. The dark hearted caramel whiskey is in complete harmony. Hazelnuts toy with coconut, oak and greased vanilla beans. Every piece is a match made in heaven. Flavor delights in full bodied abundance. Toffee encased with melting caramel liquor twines around the tongue and snaps like a spark to ignite the rest of the mouth. Melting jojoba lies with caramelized graham cracker crust with fire roasted coconut flakes blended into a pot of broiling bourbon crème brulee. Black plums and baked prunes serve as dark fruit elixirs, as a touch of blackened boysenberries is extinguished by bourbon rye prune melt. Dry, bitter tongue feels clean despite the heavy, full bodied assault thats laid at its doorstep and chewed up like its bourbon laced milk chocolate truffles. Brandy butter and heavy caramel currents reinstate the crème brulee masterpiece in its triumphant finish. Another huge thank you to tpkenned for another wonderful bottle.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

3054,"2007-04-14",4.4,"25 oz bottle, via BA Marvz.  Pours a very dark brown, almost black, body under a tight bubbled foamy brown head.  Moderate carbonation retains the head as a small creamy covering.  Aroma is very thick and rich, just amazing.  Vanilla, bourbon, thick caramel and toffee malts, and some light alcohol.  Flavor is equally harmonious and rich.  Huge caramel malt with a moderate brown sugar note grabs you first, then a rush of vanilla, but not like most barrel beers vanilla, this was like it was infused with actual beans.  Finishes then with the brandy/bourbon, oakiness, and some alcohol.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and very sturdy without being sticky or cloying like I would expect from such a high gravity beer with this much risidual sweetness.  Perfect soft fine carbonation.  This beer amazed me with the level of synergy that was acheived given the intensity of all the individual aspects.  This is the epitome of what people refer to as a ""sipper"" beer.

The Angels Share is a very dark amber brown color with a foamy tan head.  The aroma on this beer is an unbelieveable blend of malts, aged fruit (cherry, plum, raisin), bourbon, oak, vanilla, and alcohol.  This also has a very inviting sweetness to it.  The same qualities found in the aroma can also be found within the complex flavor of this beer.  The maltiness in the flavor is rich, sugary, and mostly caramel and fruit.  I also noticed robust red wine (similar to Shiraz or Merlot ) and port flavors.  A warming bourbon and whiskey alcohol prescence melds nicely with other flavors.  The oak/wood adds an enjoyable dryness in the finish.  This beer has a medium body and is very smooth on the palate.  I really feel fortune and privileged that I got to try this awesome beer.

3054,"2007-03-12",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2008 Sampled at the Knoxville tasting courtesy of Beer_Hawk, thanks Steve.  I had wanted to try this for a long time, that is, until I smelled it and noticed that it reminded me of bourbon.  Not just a barrel aging, but like I had mistakenly poured myself a glass of Beam.  It is dark with a small little head on it.  Smell is pleasing, notes of vanilla, oak, fruits, some hops.  Taste is somewhat smooth, with a few hints of hops, but mostly it tastes like bourbon.  I was not at all impressed with this, nor am I really impressed with the whole barrel aging trend that has been going around for a while.  Take the barrel away, and this would be so good, probably the best barley wine I have ever had.  Put it in the barrel, and I didnt enjoy it at all.  Makes me doubt the BA Old Salty I have now.  Bourbon barrel aging is fine, but the beer needs to taste like beer, not bourbon.  This was the biggest disappointment of the evening for me.  Thank you Steve for the chance to sample this very rare and highly sought after beer.

Ok so Sean and Garrett keep telling me to rerate this beer, so I opened one this weekend for new years.  Yeah I think I was high on cocaine when I rated this the first time.  It is really good, and the longer it sits in your glass the easier it becomes to drink.  Very smooth, very rich, and lastly, very powerful.  A potent beer that left me staggering somewhat after slamming it down.  The bourbon taste is not as strong as I remembered.  My last bottle of it will certainly be one to hold on to, and not put on ebay.  Thanks a ton for the bottles Garrett.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

Really, really, really appealing aroma - cherry and wine, some bourbon, some vanilla, some oak - I could go on, but just listing the component of the aroma wont do it justice.

This has thick boatloads of natural vanilla flavor with undertones of tobacco, earth, oak.

3054,"2007-01-19",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2007 1/19/07.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, purchased at Port Brewing in San Marcos, CA 12/1/06.  Dark cola brown with some opacity and deep orange-burgundy highlights.  Small but uniform and compact pale tan head.  Fades to a thin whisp of some fortune-telling bullshit.  If you stir up the head enough (and it looks beautiful, if given a vigorous pour), lacing is similarly dense (again, where it forms, which is not always so prominent if its poured very gently) and has irregular-but-decent stickiness.  Aroma is boldly woody (even with hints of acidity), with all of the sweet alcoholic indulgences-- brandy or bourbon, who cares?  Its that densely cakey, refined vanilla essence (or should I say ""refinedly refined?""-- this is processed vanilla extract of the utmost quality), as well as impossibly rich caramel, dark bread, and brown sugar notes.  This aroma is actually almost quadruppelly (Westy 12 or Rochefort, not Monky Brew or Allagash Four), if it werent for the strong wood character.  Some subtler notes of fruit that seem to fade in and out as the beer opens up (or as I get more drunk, I cant tell).  Flavor is certainly in the Midnight Sun Arctic Devil and Drakes Brandy Barrel realm of Barley Wines-- English in inspiration-- with dark, nougaty, richness and suggestions of dark toffee, huge deep caramel notes and alcohol enough to age at least a decade or so.  The finish is one of those lovely things about this beer, leaving chocolate tobacco notes quite a long while-- another beautiful cigar beer.  Surprisingly drinkable for its gravity.  Carbonation is fairly light but consistent throughout, perfectly conditioned for this kind of a beer (although I still cant help noticing that it comes off quite boozy at times both in the aroma and in the flavor).  Its so subtle but creamy while its there, and so slight that you can stir it up in your mouth to excite the same if it fades-- terrifically matching the barrel character and caramel richness tit for tat.  Expert extraction of malt flavors and integration of barrel character with the base beer; its hard to define at times where one thing ends and the other begins.  Also, its almost crazy to think about, but this totally overwhelmed the 71% cocoa bar of Valrhona chocolate that I tried to pair it with in the last few ounces.  If I could find a chocolate that could stand up to the vanilla and caramel of this beer, I think I would die of sensory overload right there on the spot.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

3054,"2007-01-18",3.8,"Bottle shared by EDA on 1/12/07 at Hop Devil Grill.  Thanks as always, Mike.Large, frothy, well-retained dark beige-chestnut colored head tops a milk chocolate colored body that shows medium to  medium-high clarity, tiny bubbles and moderate to low lacing.  Quite a nice appearance for a barrel-aged beer, which usually undercuts some of the retention and lacing.Big, bold, aroma swells from the glass, fully coating the senses and issuing notes of sweet vanilla and brandy mixed in milk chocolate.  The malts are immediately felt behind the barrel, supporting the strong bourbon character with sweet cream, milk chocolate and thick caramel.  Light char and some prune character seem to be the extent of the dry elements, but the sweet notes are just so round, soft and endearing, as if crushed velvet is gingerly passed across the nostrils.  No harsh tannins, fusels, wood or hop notes to ruin the party, which goes over well with me.  Warming releases some alcohol esters, which mix with the bourbon and chocolate to produce a strong brandy soaked raisin and sweet fig combo.At first sip, Im rather taken aback and announce that the barrel character is overdone.  Heavy bourbon notes of vanilla, wood, cinnamon, brandy and light alcohol seem to overwhelm the palate.  Caramel only follows after the barrel notes are finished having their way.  Chocolate and raisins, with toffee and buttercream join the mix as well.  A mix of creaminess and stickiness is had by the very tight carbonation, in low amounts, and sweet base malts combined with soft caramel maltiness.  I was ready to write it off and I think I actually went and got another beer.  I was persuaded to drink more of my glass however, and was glad I did so.  The barrel character, while certainly not having disappeared, seemed to fold in to the rich maltiness.  Instead of grainy wood character, strong vanilla and bourbon dryness, it seems more of a chocolate and vanilla stout with a caramel-bourbon twist.  The malts win out in texture, in the end, and it finishes soft and round.  Still decidedly sweet and lightly sticky, but much more balanced.  So Im more or less appeased.  Im a tough sell on barrel aged barleywines and this is probably the best overdone (I still maintain it is, despite the much nicer experience after breathing/warming) barleywine Ive had.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Thanks to drewbeerme for this amazing sample.  Pours a brown black chocolate color with a frothy milk chocolate head that fades down (is this a barley wine or impy stout).  A lot of beers have toffee in the flavors and esters but this has tons of toffee in the nose and taste unlike any other and especially unlike any other barley wine.  Toffee and chocolate blend in the nose with some of the hard to distinguish subtleties found in the flavor. Toffee, chocolate, bourbon, oak (i can even tasted the charred to it), vanilla, and those syruppy dark red fruit flavors underneath just barely peaking thier head out.  Slick syruppy mouthfeel with the alcohol burn on the tip of the tongue.  
Its hard to believe this is still pretty fresh b/c all though it is a little hot, these flavors are balanced so nicely so that nothing is overpowering and the beer tastes amazingly complex.  A fine example of a barrel aged beer that many brewers could learn from.

Its hard not to rate this to style, because this is not a barley wine.  More like a generic American Strong.

3054,"2006-12-10",4.5,"HUGE thanks to hophead75 for bringing this to the RB Captain Lawrence gathering - there were a lot of great beers at that event, but this will probably be the only one I wind up rating - thats how much this beer stands out - really dark, blood red, nearly black pour - loads of oak and chocolate wafting up from the glass at first, then, once you really get your nose into the glass, you can smell complex vinous/port-like notes, brown sugar, black cherry, dough/bread/pastry aromas - thick, slick, oily mouthfeel, with a very dense, full body - dark, overripe fruit and a red wine/oak barrel character are most noticable at first, but begin intermingling with the sweeter characteristics that the aroma suggested to begin with - the sweetness is tempered by a kind of vinous, tannic twang, that never really comes to the fore, but still stays quite present in the background - the beer has the thick, chewy quality of some of the best imperial stouts (rare for a barleywine), yet retains the refined elegance that many beers of such thickness fail to achieve - this is an amazing beer - I must have more - MORE!","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

3054,"2006-11-24",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2012 750 mL Bottle. Aroma is running away and just out of reach initially. There are some insanely, entirely rich bourbon brandy emaciated currants with toasted almost, with bright estery yeast notes. Very warming alcohol, with barrel drawing a bite in the nose. Luxious matuer fruit. The aroma wakes up and glows a little stronger with a little more warmth and swirling. Flavor is so completely delicious, with amazing bourbon touches and a heavy head of canded fruit, sugared mango and crystallized ginger. The beer complexity is lightly muddled and condensed into a sweet, creamy dense flavor. The flavor starts with a real tangy, bright sweet pear, then ascends to a rich malt creaminess over brandy flavor, with piquant yeast richness following. Then a rising phoenix of flaming alcohols appear from the dust. The alchol is enlightening and scorches the nostrils, but its not disconcerting. This beer is young and will only get better with time and the alcohols that are perceptible are actually astonishingly characterfull, so they are well appreciated. Even notes of earth and woody mingle in, with a genuflection on the altar of a competely seductive malt character. Figs in honey, maple syrup candy next to hazlenut-chocolate wafers all in one. It reminds me of living in Amsterdam and going down to the market street in the morning and getting large, fresh hot sticky syrupy stroopwafels right off of the griddle and eating them right there at the stall, fresh of crusty caramel and wafer. Finish continues amazing complexity, with bright Chinese cassia, blended aromatic pink and white pepper and redolent in tawn fruit. Oh wow, its getting hard to explain all the permutations of this beer. Barrel character is only helpful, and thats what makes this beer so astonishing. It doesnt get out of hand or overwhleming, a true team player, adding yet another exciting delicious level. Finally, a closing curtain of grassy mentholness, with some sou spice and a few more bright yeasty esters in juniper. This beer has complete complexity and is an all around winner. Subtleness and exacting execuation make this beer tops, with astounding dry clarity and total excellence. I appreciate the ability to clearly distinguish all the nuanced characters individually and culture appreciate for the niches of this beer. An amazing opportunity.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Rich, dark chocolate dipped figs and dried prunes dance on the tongue.

3054,"2006-10-08",4.8,"GABF 06: One of my favorite finds of this session. Intense nose let me know it meant business, and it really grabbed my attention after the first whiff. Mouthfeel was divinely silky and velvety. Perfect carbonation level. Deep brown hue with a nice and lasting froth. 
Very complex, with notes of rich brown sugar, fresh-baked multi-grain bread, dark fruit, sour apples, dark chocolate, walnuts and bold toffee (many more flavors and aromas, too many to mention). I went back for multiple samples of this. Tremendously awesome beer.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
3054,"2006-10-04",3.9,"GABF 06. Total sock-knocker. Beer was murky, medium-brown colored. Small, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing head. The aroma was malty with light notes of roasted grain, milk chocolate, light molasses and trace notes of top soil; Hoppy with a moderate herbal note; Yeasty with a light notes of raisin and basement; Miscellaneous notes of oak, vanilla, burbon and a light note of underripe banana. The flavor was heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter with a long, lightly acidic, clean finish. The body was medium, the texture was velvety and the carbonation was lively. The whole experience was mellowed, satiny, complex and luxe. I HAVE to get some more of this.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","luckygirl"
3054,"2006-10-04",4.5,"Overall the best beer I tasted at the 2006 GABF. This beer is incredibly complex with overtones of carmel and alcohol blending well with the vanilla character of the wood and bourbon. The alcohol is pleasant yet very distinguishable. Palate is smooth and only gets better as it warms. I cant wait to buy a case of this and let age to enjoy one every new year. Cheers Tomme Arthur for an excellent beer.","USA","rjulian24"
3054,"2006-10-02",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2007 GABF 2006.  Bottle.  The beer pours to a DARK mahogany body with a thin white/tan head.  The aroma is licorice-like with some sweet bourbon, vanilla.  Overly bourbony.  The flavor is sweet bourbon, vanilla, not much else.  Overly barrel aged.  The palate has a nice warming and good coating feel. 7, 4, 7, 4, 14 = 3.6

Resampled this via Jason.  This time, I noticed strong bourbon and vanilla notes in the flavor.  I liked it better, perhaps the beer has mellowed a bit?","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
3054,"2006-10-02",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2007 Ill start with saying that I tried all the lost abbey series at GABF and found w/ the exception of the tommee that they are all pretty overrated and share a similar yeast characteristic.
Dark pour hints of reds small tan head w/ nice lacing.  Aroma of bourbon, oak, vanilla, and buttered toffe... not much other than the bareling really comes through.  Palate is rich and creamy.  Flavor of vanila oak heavy bourbon notes butters, etc. 
this is a pretty good beer, but what was it before the barreling.. i really only get barelling in the beer.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
3054,"2006-10-01",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2006 one of my favorites also at the GABF 06.  Aroma is dark malts, raisins, somewhat earthy, and alot of light alcohol sweetness.  Taste is chocolate, dark malts, some bready yeast, bourbon, plums/raisins, maybe even grapes, vanilla, and wood. All of the different elements in the taste compliment each other very well instead of standing on their own.  Very complex.  I can only imagine how great this would be aged for a few more years.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
3054,"2006-10-01",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2007 GABF 2006.  I feel pretty good about rating this one as I had 8+ samples of it and it was the best beer @ the fest.  The most complex beer Ive ever had.  Malty sweetness, raisins, chocolate w/ a creamy, oaky, bourbon finish.  Light alcohol presence on the back of the throat.  Best beer Ive rated thus far.  A definite Top 10 beer.","Freeport, Georgia, USA","jimbowood"
