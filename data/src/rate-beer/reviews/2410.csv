2410,"2016-03-06",4.1,"A few samples at the ice cider festival in Montreal with Paul. After a few years of attending, the typical vendor has shaken out to offering a dry / sparkling cider, an ice cider, and usually some sort of cuvvee, winter blend or special vintage ice cider. In the past two years Ive noticed some cideries starting to present an additional offering - a sparkling cider. Like most of their other products, La Face nails it out of the park with this one. Such a strange mouthfeel which combines the typical thickness and viscocity of an ice cider with some bubbly carbonation throughout. A touch sweeter than youd expect but it works so well. Sweet apples, sugars, honey and bright maple glides over the tongue. Great stuff.Earlier Rating: 2/16/2015 Total Score: 4Bottle sampled at Mondial 2015 in Montreal with Linh, Ken and Nica. Pours a thick golden body with light bubbles. The pour alone reveals this to be different than many of the other sparkling ciders and it seems to truly be a hybrid of the sparkling and ice cider styles. Mouthfeel is a amalgamation of bubbly, thick sweet apple syrup with notes of rich sweet honey, apple pie, sweet sugar, light oak, earthy character and maybe even some cheese. Not sure why I didnt pick up a bottle of this. Really good stuff.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2410,"2016-01-26",4.0,"Bottle, split with jaodesaulniers. Clear rich gold amber pour with tiny sparkles of carbonation slowly rising through the viscous liquid. Aroma is pretty classic, Neige sets a standard, baked apple, caramel, cooked apple, light spice. Taste is very sweet, rich, liquory apple flavor with just a hint of spice. Palate is full bodied, can barely feel the carbonation if at all, very thin. Delicious, although I wonder why they bother with carbonation.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

2410,"2015-05-28",4.1,"2012 vintage. 375mL bottle, pours a hazy vibrant orange with bubbles due to the sparkling. Nose is complex as hell, with toffee, caramel, butterscotch, that kind of thing, with syrupy apples, and lots of residual sugars. Flavour is similar, with complex butterscotch, caramel, syrupy apples, and a hint of acidity. The carbonation isnt even really noticeable -- maybe a hint of the bubbles.

2410,"2015-03-01",3.7,"Bottle (375 ml). As ""Neige Méthode Traditionnelle"". Split 4-ways, 

Appearance: Clear bright golden/copper, leaving some nice legs on the glass. 

Aroma: Yellow fruits (pears, tropical fruits), burnt caramel, freshly harvested red apples and light sweetness notes.

Taste: Burnt caramel, freshly harvested red apples, yellow fruits, light acidity and light to moderate residual sugars. Alcohol is well hidden.

Palate: Medium body. Sparkling (soft) carbonation. The bubbles clean the sticky sweetness that is usually present is La Face Cachée ice ciders so the finish is a lot less sweeteer than in their other products. 

Overall: The bubbles makes this Ice Cider a bit more drinkable than the usual La Face Cachée products, but it also hinder the complexity, the juicy apples mouthfeel and the sticky sweet finish, It also make the product tast a bit ""cheaper"". Not bad, but 9 times out of 10 I will choose the regular Neige Premiere over this one.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2410,"2015-02-27",3.7,"Thanks Tommy for sharing.

A - Very dark golden bronze color. still but a nice cork pop 

S - Nose has a bit of cherry, pear and nectarine with a lot of residual sweetness.

T - Interesting taste, has a bit less sweetness than regular Premiere. Sharp granny smith apple, I get some old citrus. bubbles detract from the taste a bit.

M - Nice bubbly mouth feel, residual sugar finish. tart at the finish as well.

O - This is a nice cider, tart finish, sweet up front, a bit more child-like, like a welchs carbonated apple juice. tasty but not worth revisiting for the cost.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
2410,"2014-12-24",4.3,"2009 Vintage bottle. Pours with a clear deep golden hued body with a small white ring of foam, some legs and light yeast floaties. Aromas are amazing La Face ice cider (its been too long since Ive had one of these). Lightly cheesy, with intense vibrant apple, strong acidity, tannin, warming baking spices. Incredibly vibrant! Flavors are sweet and strongly acidic. Both are extremely strong and would be completely unbalanced without the other. Carbonation is petilant, and doesnt add much to this already unbelievable beverage. Huge acidity, lemony, vibrant apple. An absolutely wonderful dessert wine. As with any La Face Cachee product, this is a complete gem!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

Drank almost half of the bottle. Pours very dark caramel amber, has this spend time on barrels? Nose is warming spirit-like, boozy, syrupy apple, Sirop de Liège, La Face Cachée de la Pomme-style but tad more overtly spirit-like. Warming sirop de Liège, spirit apple, warming, boozy, thick caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon, red apple.

2410,"2014-09-28",4.2,"Bottle care of a trade with TimE. Orange, rusty, almost pink, effervescent, no head, oily in the glass. Nose is sweet, sugary, syrupy, red apple skins, something like an old plastic bucket, icing sugar, tart tatin (caramelised apple tart), minerals. Taste is sweet apple, some subtle apple bitterness, red flesh apple, some vinous sweet grape, caramel. Its very much in the sweet wine category. A little bit of that sunshine Sauternes grape sweetness, but with sweet and bitter apple notes. Really very nice. Nose is very sweet caramelly and then on the taste theres some nice apple sweetness and light acidic.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","EdKing"

>> Low to no pop from the cork. Clear, deep tea orange, no foam, huge legs. Nose is insanely rich as always apple pie with melted cheese topping.

2410,"2012-08-23",4.0,"Une autre surprise damis de longue date lors dun bbq pour fêter, entre autre, ma dernière année en tant que trentenaire.  Donc, une bouteille de 375 ml partagée entre certains convives et un petit verre de ce liquide bien doré qui, ma foi, me semble peu effervescent à loeil.  Une fois rendue au nez, cest lhabituel bouquet de la maison qui frappe avec délicatesse.  Les pommes sont gorgées de sucre caramel et se permettent, bien sûr, des touches acidulées qui viennent apporter un certain équilibre.  Au goût, cest lagréable surprise de bulles assez actives qui volent la vedette.  Les saveurs sont alors bien chamboulées et les pommes semblent être tombées dans une fontaine de jouvance: une belle cohésion vivifiante et fraîche!  En bouche, le liquide est pur délice et sa prestance ravie mon palais.  En finale, une sensation mordante de ces fruits du verger qui semblent avoir nettement éte cueillis pour moi en cette journée où le plaisir est bien au-dessus de toutes les autres valeurs.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
2410,"2011-08-28",4.0,"Thanks Fred.  Pours a clear medium gold with a white head and pretty lively interior carbonation.  Lovely nose of baked apples, caramel, honey, something else, fleeting.  Mouth is thicker than expected, sweet baked apple dumplings with brown sugar, honey.  Flavor profile is heavier and darker than the nose, very sugary.  A bit boozy.  Carbonation is ample and prickly.  Given the presentation and that this is sparkling I think a drier profile would have been apt.  But La Face is amazing and this is still really good.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
