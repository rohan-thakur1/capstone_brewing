141,"2015-02-19",4.1,"Bottle (200 ml) split with the Québec crew. Thanks to the lady for this bottle!

Appearance: Clear bright deep golden with nice legs. 

Aroma: Weird and not so enticing aroma dominated by alcohol (and almost thinner like notes) at first along tart apples and light brown sugar.

Taste: It gets a lot better here. It doesnt seem to be the same product. Medium sweetness that is perfectly balanced by a great biting acidity. Tart apples, brown sugar notes and light spiciness. 

Palate: Medium to full body. Still as it should be. Liquorous and sticky mouthfeel. Bright acidic finish.

Overall: The aroma is disappointing, but the taste and mouthfeel are awesome and exactly what I look for in an Ice Cider. Extremely enjoyable because of the perfect acidity level. With a better aroma, it would be one of the best Ice Ciders I have tried so far. Loved it.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
141,"2015-02-19",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2015 Thanks to tom10101 for sharing that bottle. Pours a clear golden and completely still and leaves some legs on the glass. Nose is of cooked apples and alcohol, not the best aroma ever for an ice cider. Taste is moderately sweet and nicely tart, made of apple and brown sugar and ends on light peppery notes. Body is moderate and mouthfeel sticky and syrupy. It is not too heavy and really drinkable, really. Overall a nice treat, thanks Tom!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

141,"2011-09-22",4.3,"Bottle shared by Paul. Full, rich aroma of apples, clearly the cryo-extracted rather than concentrated (not frozen on the tree), but a very solid example of such. Granny smith, pear, passionfruit, bright and crisp fig, Luxurious body, intensely concentrated, honey and fresh farm cider. Excellent balancing acidity, perfect example of the style.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
141,"2010-08-28",3.6,"2003 vintage bottle labeled as ""Ice Apple Wine"" for export, bought in Kuala Lumpur (not cheap). Rich cinnamon/auburn, looks like amber the stone. Smells hot and strong immediately but then mellows into cinnamon and apple skins and has a simpler aroma than expected. Palate is thick, sweet and almost syrupy leaving a lot of sugars on the tongue. Very sweet but has a nice granny smith-like natural tartness for balance. There is not a lot going on, for its just simple, sweet, and nice. As it warms the acidity really comes through and makes for a nice balanced experience. Becomes mellower, less sweet. Although it remains simple, its tastier by the sip.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
141,"2010-07-29",3.5,"2003 bottle from Cold Storage, KLCC.  Pours with a bright bronze colour.  The aroma has some apple depth, food appley, with oats and cinnamon - apple crumble instead of apple pie!  The taste is appley first, with some good tartness for balance (I like tartness in an ice cider sometimes).  The finish, however, has a bit too much alcohol.  It is not as soft and warming as your typical ice cider, perhaps because its for the Asian market?  Still a fair amount of stickiness, but not as rich as some ice ciders.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
