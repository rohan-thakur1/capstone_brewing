3935,"2016-05-19",3.5,"750 ml bottle to snifter (thanks Ferris). Looks solid; a very cloudy orange with a light pink hue to it and ample fizzy eggshell head that steadily dissipates into very thin lacing. Carbonation is very lively. Smells fairly tart with notes of oak and wheat up front alongside a mild to moderate berry presence in the background. Some atypical funk as well. Tastes like it smells with an acidic, very lively medium-bodied mouthfeel. A bit more fruit on the tongue as well. Enjoyable, but not very fruity, and not on par with some of their other (imperial) bus.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
3935,"2016-05-01",3.7,"Bottle. Pours quite cloudy pink lemonade, minimal head and lacing. Aroma is quite funky, fleshy, raspberries, lactic acid. Flavor is medium tart, medium funk, kind of sharp and fruity. Bit of a harsh finish. Medium body.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3935,"2016-03-05",3.8,"Cloudy pink with a vigorous carbonation but strangely no head. Aroma is cherry, raspberry, sourdough. Medium bodied, tart on the palate with big fruity notes and a sour finish. Taste is sour cherry, tart raspberries, sour candy.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","GothGargoyle"

3935,"2015-08-09",3.8,"Poured from a bottle. 
Aroma is slightly poopy with a lot of raspberry and cherry character, but more raspberry than cherry. Medium acidity with some light citrus and yogurt notes. Faint wheat and oak. 
Pours a cloudy, orangish red with a large, frothy,slightly pink head that quickly recedes and disappears. No lacing and faint legs. 
Flavor is very acidic with some light citrus and yogurt notes. Light wheat character as well. Moderate cherry and raspberry notes with more cherry than the aroma, but raspberry is still a bit stronger. Lingering acidity and citrus. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, fairly fruity with more cherry as it warms. Rather acidic though, possibly too acidic. Tasty though.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3935,"2015-08-09",3.9,"Smell is sour. Taste is cherry and raspberry but the sourness isnt as intense as the non-imperial version. Light to medium body, medium to high carbonation, and some foam.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
3935,"2015-07-15",3.6,"[ 75cl Bottle ][ 7oz ][ @tasting ][ $ - ? ][ Tulip ][ 07.14.15 ]Calling this a berliner weisse seems foul. Its a Sour/Wild or Fruit beer given the aggressive citric acid and lack of comparable grain. Compared to DG Cherry Raz Bu (3.8). Hazy peach-gold colored, less red and larger fizzy head that lasts compared to non-imperial. Heavy green berry seed nose, lightly dusty phenols. Less complexity, simpler fruit sweetness up front, thinning raspberry across mid with plenty of skin dryness, mouth puckered from heavy citric acid, some darker Berry but the cherry acid dominating compared to non-Imperials complexity. Fizzy and thinner body. Think NG Raspberry Tart with higher acid, more complexity in the nose. Sweetness and acid in metallic contrast.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
3935,"2015-07-14",3.6,"Pour is faintly hazed, peach hue to the a pale red, lots of bubbly white head. Nose is a bit less fruity and less sweet than the regular. More oak, some nice dusty brett, a hint of eggy brett. Flavor is cherry pie filling, fairly acidic, light brett, a touch simple. High carb, light body.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
3935,"2015-07-02",3.4,"Bottle @ De Garde. Amber in color with a short lived white head. Big cherry pie on the nose. Theres some grass and only a little bit of raspberry, actually. Not as intense as the regular version. The flavor is kind of just sour and citric more than anything. A bit of cherry skin and pie filling. Dry finish, light oak and grass on the back end. Slight acetic note.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3935,"2015-07-01",3.7,"Bottle (750 ml) from kcherney, thanks! Split 2-ways.

Appearance: Cloudy salmon color with a medium quickly vanishing white head and no lacing. 

Aroma: Typical De Garde gastric notes at first, but also some nice cherries and rasperries presence, lactic notes and oak. 

Taste: Medium acidic presence with not much sweetness, medium fruitiness (cherries, raspberries), oak (quite a lot), lactic presence and moderate gastric notes. 

Palate: Medium body. Lively carbonation at first, but it quickly become moderately carbonated. Rather oaky and dry finish. Fruity aftertaste, 

Overall: Good fruited Berliner Weisse. Its tasty stuff, but the ""gastric"" presence hinders the drinkability a bit. Definitely not my worst De Garde, but also certainly not stellar.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

3935,"2015-05-25",3.9,"Bottle sample @ Leuven Beer Innovation 2015, shared with the RB Belgian crew. Many thanks to Don, Digita7693, for sharing the bottle.
Couleur rosée pâle et trouble, col fin blanc.
Arôme est inondé de belles effluves de framboises avec un rétro présentant une belle palette fruitée et de funk tirant vers laigrelet. Le tout garde un côté me rappelant un peu le rubber des ballons gonflables. 
Palais sur une effervescence moyenne-haute qui est poussée à son extrême par le profil aigrelet et terreux des framboises. En létat je note quasi rien venant de la cerise, le tout reste puissant ne bouche par le picotement aigre que cette dernière procure en bouche. 

Agréable, mais à se demander pourquoi le tout est totalement dominé par un profil de framboise alors que le nom de fait mention que de cerise.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
3935,"2015-05-25",3.6,"Due to artificial coloured illumination, appearance not estimable, arbitrary 4/5  Smells of rubber (S) and raspberry... as to cherries? Sourish, titillating (CO²?), and again raspberry! Retronasal again a bit of burnt rubber. Looks uncarbonated, feels spritzy! Light body, acidburn.

Sharp sweet-tart aroma; lots of cherry skin acidity & sourness, lemon, under-ripe berries. Hint of musty hay & footy funk underneath it. Flavor follows through as expected; cherry skin, raspberry, lemon flesh, lacto sourness, wet hay, a bit of must, some cotton funk, & a sour cherry finish. Sharp, very light, & acidic.

Thanks to my secret mule group, aka my old coworker who was down for a camping trip, I got this and a number of other bottles I cant wait to now open. Pours a deep purple with light pink head. Aroma is tart cherry and some raspberry as it warms. Wow. Taste is a light to almost moderate sourness with with the fruit really being a huge player here. The cherry is light but the first thing I taste with the berry coming in near the middle and dominating from there.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"

3935,"2015-03-14",3.6,"22oz shared by Pruf bottle poured into a HotD 20th anniversary wine glass. Hot pink pour with a loud head that dies like soda. Aroma is super tart, puckering tart and candy berries. I know its cherry and raspberry but its like a suped up watermelon Jolly Rancher. Super effervescent and too fruity tart without something to balance. Flavor is not acetic at all but really strong citric and other tartness, almost too much. Flavor is the same, super tart, vigorous carbonation, fruits stripped out a bit. Just a sharp, tart beer with fruit accents. I like it but I wish it had less tartness and more lactic qualities.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
