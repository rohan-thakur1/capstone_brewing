3995,"2016-02-29",3.6,"Deep dark brown coloured body with a nice almost black, fully opaque body with a thick, three centimetre tall deep brown head. Aroma of roasted malt, PNW hops, caramel, light nuts, earth and a touch of smoked peat as well - not too fragrant, but noticeable with the malt more so than the hops. Medium to Full-bodied; Strong herbal and piney hops up front that give way to a torched malt flavour with a hint of smoke and earth really coming through, along with a earthy quality and some light mushroom flavours. Aftertaste is well balanced with the hops and the malt with quite a bit of earthiness and not much sweetness to speak of at all - perhaps a touch of caramel. Overall, a nice Black IPA with a pronounced malt note and some nice hop elements, but the body really isnt there and there isnt too much complexity aside from the smoke and peat flavours, but still good to sample - a top Black IPA - not so much (at least not now), but worth trying if you can find it.

Aroma: Slight roast undertone with a strong hop aroma that is fruit forward, like tropical and berry notes, with pine resin as well. 
Taste: Starts with a rich, chocolate maltiness that has a slight hint of roast, quickly turning to a strong, but balanced resinous bitterness. Maltiness drowns out any fruity hop flavors. So smooth and drinkable for a beer of this strength and bitterness. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate to high carbonation, especially for the style. 
Finish: Touch of roast of chocolate linger with some hop resin on the tongue. 
Overall: Probably the most balanced and drinkable Black IPA Ive ever had. has a rich maltiness that is not interrupted by sharp hop flavors. Considering its a double IPA, its all the more impressive.","","TH28"

The aroma blends citrus and resin hops, astringent booze, and low levels of roast, and the taste is quite bitter with strong resinous and grassy hops dominating the tongue. The citrus flavors do bring a slight sweetness to the taste, but its not enough to cut through the roast bitterness that arises in the middle of the flavor on top of the hops; the aftertaste fades to hop flavor without too much roast remaining.

FLAVOR has lots of juicy tropical fruit, sweet citrus, and notable dark roastiness and sweet-ish caramel/toffee as it approaches the finish. Much more fruity and sweet than most Black IPAs, and it works here. The high ABV is very well concealed, making this surprisingly quaffable.

3995,"2015-07-28",3.8,"12oz brown bottle from Whole Foods, into a nucleated schooner glass. It poured an opaque black colour, reddish at the edges when held to the light, with tight beige foam, long-lasting with lots of lace. Surprisingly well-balanced for a 9.5% ABV black IPA. Undeniably hoppy, but not too bitter which I enjoyed. Citrusy, earthy, woodsy, hint of lemongrass and Fruit Loops cereal. Equally complex in the malt department: toasty, roasty, hints of black cherry, black plum, black currant, black raspberry. Light-medium body, moderate carbonation. No adverse alcoholic traits despite the high ABV, though I definitely felt its warmth a minute later as my face reddened. Though the brewers boasts about the debittered black malt, I actually tasted plenty of charred grain qualities akin to porter and stout, in a very good way. Delicious bittersweet and fruity aftertastes. This is much how I imagine historic India Porter mustve tasted. Great stuff. Take it slow or itll kick your butt.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

The first and last sips of this beer gave me goosebumps. Maybe it was because I have not had beer in three days (weird). Anyway, it seemed to me to be way more of a DIPA and the roast was just something to accentuate the DIPA flavors. Those were good, of course, but I felt a tad underwhelmed by this beer. The fruit flavor was spot on, but I was a little confused about what it was doing with the roast and malt.

Initially a nice mouth feel but it is a little astringent. Theres a dueling flavor of chocolate/roast/mild smoke to complement the tropical fruit and herbal elements. Strong and kind of boozy.

Very lightly slick, touch dry in the finish. Chocolate, grapefruit citrus. Definitely some tropical aroma. Touch of coffee. Mild nuttiness, and cake-like malt. No doubt, an amazing aroma. A very interesting and complex black IPA. The sweet bite just slows me down, though. Its kind of a strange brew. The front is so complex and welcoming. But sips are punished with a rough and regretful backend. Like a vice, though, you find yourself repeatedly lifting the glass for more sips.

Hard to believe this is 9.5 ABV. Medium/Full bodied with a creamy/slick mouthfeel. Finish is very dry but not astringent at all. Obviously Bells has saved the best for last in the planet series. The last two have been fantastic. At 2.50 a bottle I would also say this is one of the best buys in beer.","rochester hills, Michigan, USA","libertine"
3995,"2015-06-07",3.5,"Pitch black pour with mahogany hue and an eighth inch of khaki head, very small bubbles evident rising from the glass bottom. Aroma of oats and pre-beer grains, and a hint of chocolate. Average to lively carbonation, frothy creamy mouthfeel, dry finish that leaves film on teeth. Great blend of flavors: pine hops, Carmel malt, bitter chocolate, zesty citrus rind, a bit boozy. Pretty solid black IPA, reminds me of a two hearted with different darker malts.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","bwa5879"
3995,"2015-06-07",3.9,"Pour from a 12oz bottle. Clear dark brew that glowers deep brownish red when held up to light. Aroma of citrus, grapefruit, tropical fruit, hints of resin, toast and coffee. Taste is very slightly sweet malts and grapefruit up front transitioning to a toasty malt, slightly resinous grapefruity tropical fruit finish. A bit of roasted grain, coffee and cocoa emerges at the end. Excellent.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","Onslow"
3995,"2015-06-06",3.8,"Pours black like a stout or porter with a thick tan head. Citrus and floral aroma. Taste follows the nose. No booziness comes through. Overall one of the better beers from this series.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","Mindwarp"
3995,"2015-06-06",3.7,"12 oz bottle (5/24/15) poured into bells snifter--b-52s playing in background. Immediate and powerful hoppy aroma: mostly pine resin though fading to fruit deeper in the nose. The nose is recapitulated in the taste, though with pineapple in the ascendency more than pine resin. Medium mouthful--alcohol fairly well concealed. >a nice drive in the rain","","BowlingAlone"
3995,"2015-06-05",4.1,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/24/2015. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, mango, chocolate, cocoa, toast, light char/coffee, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, mango, pine, chocolate, cocoa, toast, light char/coffee, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/charred bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, mango, pine, chocolate, cocoa, toast, light char/coffee, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate roasted malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately sticky, and slightly creamy/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Black DIPA style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to drink for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
3995,"2015-06-05",3.2,"Bottle. Aromas are grapefruit, pine, tropical fruit, cocoa, dark bread, and light coffee. Tastes hoppier than the aroma suggests. Big citrus and tropical fruit, light floral and pine hops, and lots of dusty cocoa. Very dry finish. Not a fan of the mouthfeel, rough and chalky. I really thought I was gonna like this one but its just ok.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
3995,"2015-06-05",4.0,"Cocoa powder and roasted coffee up front, balanced well with grapefruit bitterness and citrus peel. Undertones of toasted bread and brown sugar. Fairly dry citrus finish. All around very good.","","ColovianTrader"
3995,"2015-06-05",4.2,"Aroma of roasted malts and citrus hops, taste is citrus, chocolate, and some coffee, a fantastic black double ipa up there with some of the tops of the style , very good!","grand rapids, Michigan, USA","njager246"
3995,"2015-06-04",4.0,"Aroma of pine and grapefruit, taste is sweet malt forward with a punch of great pine and grapefruit, dry finish. Very pleasant.","Indiana, USA","CpyNPrnT"
3995,"2015-06-04",3.9,"Quite a difficult beer to get, even here in Bells home territory. Pours out a dark nearly black liquid with huge citrus hops aroma which almost buries the black roasted components. Orange and grapefruit loom, with just a hint of tannic dark acidity. Intriguing and complex, with a touch of alcohol heat apparent in the finish.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
3995,"2015-06-01",3.7,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate-heavy citrus and grapefruit with light chocolate. It pours a dark brown with some orange highlights and a one finger khaki head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a thicker soapy ring. There is a lot of thin soapy webbing left on the sides of the glass, The flavor starts with a quick dose of chocolate and light tropical fruits. The finish has moderate-heavy grapefruit and citrus. Its medium bodied with soft carbonation and mouthfeel. Overall, its tasty and tropical fruit flavors distinguish it a little from other Black IPAs, but Id still put it in the hoppy Porter category with most other Black IPAs.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
