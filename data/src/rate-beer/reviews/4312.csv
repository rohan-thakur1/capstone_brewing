First impression: alcohol burn (light), sweet toffee, coconut, charred oak, bourbony molasses and caramel. After drinking the 2011, I expected a much more subtle and, frankly, disappointing beer. This is much better than expected. Flavors of macadamia nuts, lightly spicy English hops, rich and fresh bourbon, soda, ubiquitous caramel, lightly bittersweet chocolate, mild roasted malt.

In long: Rich nose of raisins, figs, wood, caramel.  Taste is both smooth and very rich.  Starts with nice tasty sweet raisin wrapped in caramel, notes of date square cake.  Overall sensation of a thick juicy dessert but with a very active carbonation that prevents it from sticking in the mouth.  Finish is surprisingly woody dry and makes the beer very easy to drink, I went through my 22oz quite easitly.

It actually smells better than my description but it does have a thin, sweet quality to it.  Taste is light bourbon up front followed by a nondescript base beer consisting of sweet malt, toffee, some light hop bitterness, and some alcohol on the finish.  There is also some noticeable raisin and/or plum toward the back third of the taste.  Mouthfeel is light and thin.  On the whole just an okay beer for me.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"

Pours a fairly-dark brown with a bit of a crimson hue around the edges. Good tan head with a bit of lacing. The nose brings forward a good dosing of bourbon along with some dark fruit, malty sweetness, and a bit of cherry. The taste is mostly bourbon along with a bit of oak and dark fruits. Cherry component in the finish. Body is medium with a bit of an alcohol bite, though not too much. Carbonation is fairly low and theres a bit of a twang in the finish. Drinkability was pretty good, though this wasnt quite what I was hoping for. Not terribly complex and something a bit off in the finish.

The smell is bourbonny, but it is not over the top, which I like. There is also some cooca, fruits, and roastiness.

The flavor is kind of lost, so is the mouthfeel. It is rather thin. The predominant flavor is bitterness which really was surprising. It is very bitter for a winter warmer/bourbon aged beer.

4.0 A: Black color. One and a half fingers of super creamy beige/tan head. Average retention and a good amount of lacing.

4.0 S: Good balance between the bourbon components and the beer - the bourbon holds about 60% of the noses share. Bourbon and barrel contribute a decent amount of vanilla, oak, melon fruitiness, and a touch of booze. The underlying beer offers a pleasant plum fruitiness, some caramel, nuts, graininess and a touch of roastiness.

4.0 T: I assumed the beer would be bolder and more robust, but it it isnt and it works well. Rather it tastes like an easy drinking porter moreso than a winter warmer. Grainy, with a moderate roastiness, plenty of nuttiness, and only a mild caramel and dark fruit component. The bourbon is less pronounced than in the nose, but still plays a good role in the overall flavor. Vanilla, leather, oak, and melon are all there with some strength. I think the 10 weeks in the bourbon barrel was just right given the strength of the beer. Any longer and the beer would have to fight with the bourbon components.

4.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Somewhat creamy with a good crispness to it. I like this.

4.0 D: Pretty good and easy drinking beer. Lots of things done right and nothing done wrong.

smells like a vanilla, chocolate, oakey, with a hint of bourbon. Honestly, if you put this under my nose and I was blindfolded, I wouldnt think it was a beer. probably something out of a gourmet chocolatier or something.
taste is actually pretty damn good. to say I am shocked is an understatement. A lot of smooth oak vanilla, some chocolate, and a tiny bit of bourbon. this is quite amazing from Rahr.
mouthfeel is spot on for what it needs to be, I think if it was thicker it wouldnt be as good, and I like the thick ass stouts. but a nice medium body has this covered.
overall this is quite amazing. I am absolutely shocked. Rahr is known for mediocrity, and this is far far from it. I look forward to some other things they may put out at this kind of quality. Cheers Rahr, and congrats!","Oregon, USA","crusianbeer"

4312,"2010-01-07",4.1,"Had on tap at the Fort Worth Flying Saucer and reviewed from notes. Rahrs Winter Warmer aged in Makers Mark barrels, sounds interesting.

The beer pours a dark brown-red with a small tan head. The aroma is awesome, with some oak, vanilla, bourbon and a little roasted malt. The flavor is great as well, with tons of vanilla and oak character. You get a little bourbon and some spices as well as some dark fruit and some coffee and roasted malts. This is a complex masterpiece that is a great improvement over the regular Winter Warmer from Rahr and Sons. The beer has low carbonation and a thick mouthfeel. The alcohol is not that present in the flavor but the alcohol warming affect is great. I was sitting outside on the patio in about 40 degree weather and this beer warmed me up nicely. I wish they would bottle this because this is as good as any beer I have ever had from the state of Texas.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"

Unfortunately, I felt the bourbon flavor overpowered the beer a bit too much - the taste of bourbon is the by far the most powerful of the flavors, yet I really enjoy bourbon.  The bourbon flavor even dominates the finish.  Id like to try this with a bit less bourbon in it.  At least it stands out enough that I recommend everyone give it a try.","Texas, USA","taphandle"

4312,"2008-02-17",3.4,"Special release, standard Winter Warmer aged in Makers Mark barrels.  Local draft only, no plans to bottle.

Looks pretty much like the normal Winter Warmer, dark chestnut with little head.  But the aroma is almost all bourbon minus the alcohol heat, maybe with some caramel malt in the background.

The beer has picked up the bourbon flavors very well, as bourbon is dominant in the taste.  It tastes almost like a beer/bourbon blend, with the maltiness of the beer providing a base for the Makers Mark flavor.  Light notes of vanilla, cola and wood come through very faintly.  No alcohol heat is noted.

Mouthfeel is a little lighter than most, it remains very drinkable.  The bourbon aging may be a little too much, but perhaps it will fade with some age.  (These had only been aging for about 3 months.)","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","Assurbanipaul"
