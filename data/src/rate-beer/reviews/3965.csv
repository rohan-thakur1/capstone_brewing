3965,"2017-04-24",4.5,"So much weirdness going on in this beer. Is it an IPA? A black IPA? A coffee stout? An unholy bastardization of all three? I¬ím saying yes to all, since the various notes hitting your tongue with each sip makes every style seem reasonable. Massive coffee stout nose, chocolate and java, yet with an unexpectedly strong citric-pine undercurrent. Pour is amazing, deep rich black with a massive brown head and endless lacing. Taste starts in stout territory, mocha backed by a firm bitterness, yet the IPA notes crank up almost immediately, bathing everything in a bright citrus hop oiliness. Keeps with the espresso notes, yet a deep caramel sweetness tinged with anise adds padding, while the hops stay both bright and green and assertive. Finishes with a lengthy pinecone-in-my-coffee fade. Holy hell is this beer delicious. Perfect texture, silky smooth with just the right amount of carbonation to keep it floating between IPA and stout. I could drink this pint for years.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

A hint of brown sugar sweetness lends a hand to a very nice lasting bittersweet finish. Light to medium bodied with medium carbonation and slight creaminess. Overall, I enjoyed this a lot.

3965,"2014-03-04",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2014 My Bottom Line:
Coffee and coniferous notes benefit from a lemongrass-like spicy hoppiness in this cohesive Coffee-Infused Black IPA.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A dollop of foam stays atop the pure blackness.
-The mouthfeel is leaner than I had expected.
-Aniseed notes appear once the hops have died down somewhat (older bottle).
-This one avoids the pitfalls of novelty brews by making sure coffee is toned down.
-Hop aroma and bitterness are both engaging.

3965,"2014-02-13",4.5,"Bottle from Bierkompass. Very dark, almost black color with a dense brown head. Aroma is very interessting, because of a unique blend of fruity, fresh, hoppy impressions, which go along with a very malty, chocolate, and coffeeish aromas. Those various flavors get mingled up very well together, and give a first impression of the actual taste of the beer. 

Which is great. 

There is a lot going on, on the palate, first of, the beer begins with a stoutish character, mostly defined by a decent mix of coffee and chocolate, which both go in a creamy direction, well balanced, supported by malts and hints of caramel. This by itself creates a great flavor, but the fun is only just starting. The upcoming malt sweetness abruptly vanishes for a huge load of hops, supported by a vivid, slightly metallic carbonation. While coffee and chocolate are still present on the palate they now get mixed up with intense additions of grapefruit, mango, lime, kiwi and orange. Not only do they add a lovely freshness to the ale, but also such a great complexity, you need to take two or three sips to realize, that you don¬ít want to actually stop sipping this. Despite this being marked as a ""Stout"", it got as much ""IPA"" in it, and I love both sides, because they add up so well together. The long aftertaste rounds it all up, as it is defined by a hoppy bitterness, which goes along with a strong malt backbone, which, again, stand in perfect balance to each other.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3965,"2014-02-10",3.5,"Interesting one here, I was looking for the difference between this and BGB, and using common sense, I thought it would be the addition of hops due to the name, sort of a black IPA but more on the roasted side than hoppy side.

Dry dry dry. A touch too dry. As a reference point, when I put water in the glass after emptying it, it¬ís darker than some of the pissy lagers we had earlier. More please!

Taste is a little sharp and yeasty with a bit of a watery finish, some weird flavours coming out here - vegetable?  It¬ís OK overall.  It became a lot nicer when it had aerated a bit - lost its sharpness.

Rijk naar mokka, zijn, aardse hop, lekker hoppig met donker kruiden  en bijna een licht gerookte toets.

3965,"2012-10-29",4.1,"Bottle shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike.

The beer is dark brown, with a thin beige cap. The appearance bears an uncanny resemblance to the other Beer Geek stouts. Surprisingly good aroma, exceeding my expectations. Terrific blend of hops and dark roast. This taste much more like an American black ale (black IPA) than a stout. Really well balanced and full of flavor. A wonderful marriage of roast and hops. I highly recommend this beer.

It¬ís been a while since I had a beer this good. 9/5/8/5/18 Re-rate, 10/15/15: 11.2oz bottle. This recent release is brewed at Lervig. AFAIK, the last batch of 500ml were brewed at Nogne O.

Roast in the nose, coffee. In the flavor, more heavy roast malt, big earthy hop, pine, nice coffee aftertaste. Super-long, potent aftertaste. Crap, I was expecting to be jaded with my years of experience and widened frame of reference, but I have to admit this a great start. Medium-plus body. Drinks a bit lighter than expected, but with a decently full feel, and mild chewiness. Lighter, kind of soft carbonation. Mild slick finish. Moderate to bigger bitter taste, lighter sweet. Damn. A damn near perfect black IPA. Why do I like this so much? I don¬ít think I can tell (or remember) the difference in brewery character here, but what¬ís important is that it¬ís pretty much just as exciting as I remember.

Aroma is an incredibly interesting mix of medium & dark roast coffee, deep roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate, and some spicy, herbal, and citric hop notes. Taste is a real potent combo of all the above flavours - incredibly well balanced - the herby/spicy hop character comes through pretty well in spite of all of the heavy roasted flavour going on here; loads of brilliant intense coffee notes - a real freshly-ground taste. Plenty of roasted malt and bitter (very) dark chocolate in there too. Mouthfeel is full and silky smooth.

Then in the middle the nice carbonation comes through along with sweeter coffee and chocolate. Then finishes with more roasted flavors and a nice hint of pine, I think, from the hops. I get the mint flavor to match the smell. High medium body with a nice creamy and slick texture. I¬ím assuming this beer is intended to be drank kind of immediate. With age, the hops go away and more of the bolder stout flavors show through. My bottle was older, so the hops were faint, but still added complexity to the beer. This is an excellent lighter imperial stout that tastes bolder than it is and is somewhat unique due to the bolder hops.","Saint John, Indiana, USA","brewskis"

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured an opaque black with an average, light brown head that kept a decent sheet and left good lacing. The aroma contained moderate to heavy roasted malts and mild coffee; and hints of dark chocolate; all of which were the dominant aromas at first. As it warmed, though, there were some hint of mint hops and then mostly moderate to heavy pine, grapefruit and orange hops. The coffee notes remained dominant through bother aroma stages. the initial flavor was lightly sweet and slightly bitter; while the finish was moderately sweet and bitter with a long duration.

This was sitting for a while in the back of the fridge. I finally chose to crack it open to thin the herd now that the Mikkeller beers seem to be multiplying like rabbits in the cellar. It is a little better than the normal Beer Geek Breakfast but not so great I wish I had more bottles. Even so I look forward to the next one some time soon.

Aroma / Appearance - Fluid and thick the pour took its time to settle into the glass. A bubbly mocha head slid slowly downwards. Chocolate, heavily roasted coffee, and plums were dense in feel. The whole thing was fairly balanced.

Flavor / Palate - Black coffee, malts, and a warm alcoholic feel slide towards the palate. The strong finish lingers for a while in the back of the throat. This is not a beer to take lightly. I¬íll probably give it another shot in the future but not until trying a couple other versions first.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Heady nose hints at dark chocolate, dusty cocoa, roasted and charred carob beans and wood, cigarette smoke and a piercing weedy and herbal note that doesn¬ít sit right. Lightly spritzy start on the palate, oily and viscous from there on though light as far as body. Burnt wood, ashen smoke, tobacco and tea tannins are first to hit hard. Mild dark chocolate sweetness is drowned out completely. Palate stripping, bitter and acrid, weedy hops in back aide the tannins. Long, sharp and grippingly smoky drawn swallow like eating something you know is not fit for human consumption.

Taste has sweet singed sugars, coffee, citrus and pine. Bitter and somewhat astringent at the end. Interesting - the citrus and pine  flavours are ones that I usually find clash with roasted ones, but they dovetail relatively effectively here (for me). The hops still obscure some of the charm of the malt but the coffee shines right on through. Some licorice in the long bitter finish. This is very artfully put together... but I still wish the hops were different.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

Wow, big juicy and piney hops over a layer of espresso, roast and some chocolate. Close your eyes and you would swear you are drinking an IPA. The flavor profile is a bit more ""stout"" like than the nose but not by much, still quite piney, acidic, tropical and resiny with more bitterness supplied by the coffee. What sweeter malts maybe present are beating into a pulp by all that bitterness. Finish more than a bit metallic, roasty, and tannic. Methinks due to the coffee addition the mouth feel is a tad thin but also very vibrant and sprite.  If the Pipeworks Close Encounter is listed as an Black IPA then so should this.

A - I thought I¬íve seen motoro oil pitch black beers before. This owns the category. This is an twilight black beer just completely oily and viscous into the bottle. Produced a 2-finger coffee colored head with a mix of thick and creamy bubbles and the head stayed around for a very long time.

S - Smoked malts, chocolate malts and simcoe hops completely dominate this beer. There¬ís some coffee scent in here as well.

T - Coffee and chocolate at first taste followed by an eruption of hops that pass over the tongue and make it dance. I¬ím pretty amazed at the mix of coffee, chocolate, smoked malts and hops. Most breakfast stouts don¬ít have a big hop profile but this does. It¬ís a very unique beer. Not that boozy. I don¬ít taste the alcohol at all and no legs on the glass.

The head dissipated very little and stuck around even through a refill. Burnt marshmallow color was beautiful! Great lacing left with every sip. Aroma of dark coffee. Tastes of pure coffee and hops.

3965,"2012-01-31",3.7,"In short: A so-called Stout that is in fact an intensely bitter Black IPA with an overwhelming amount of green bitter hops.  For hopheads only (like me).
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed fresh one month after purchase (as fresh as a Mikkeller can be in North-America)
The look: Black body topped by a medium beige head with medium retention leaving a lot of lacings on the glass
In long: Nose is a explosion of fresh green hops with light notes of roast and chocolate.  Taste is more of the same.  I think there was chocolate malts, roast, an oat sensation, some booze, maybe a bit of toffee.  But as soon I took my first sip I could taste anything else than the hops.  Bitterness level is through the roof, probably in the top-10 most bitter beers I¬íve ever had.  This beer is a palate destroyer.  Hopping is very green, very fresh, like biting in green hop pellets.  The bitterness is intense enough that it adds to the alcohol bite and makes the beer appear more boozy than it is.  This is a straightforward beer but it¬ís hard for a beer to create complexity when the bitterness is so overwhelming.  I love Black IPAs and I¬ím a hophead so I enjoyed this beer, but I would only recommend this beer to extreme Black IPAs lovers.  This is rare hoppy beer that I¬íd like to taste with six more months of age on it.  Thankfully I had my Mikkeller long stem tulip glass to drink this beer, and I find it unbelievable that some people out don¬ít realize that the it tastes 25% better when a beer is served in its proper glassware and when a sandwich is cut diagonally.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Body is full, creamy, bitter (both roasty and hoppy), below average carbonation, dry roasty bitter finish.  Overall, pretty good but doesn¬ít quite measure up to Beer Here¬ís Dark Hops, which is in my opinion THE benchmark for black IPAs.

More watery in texture than expected after that full smell. Malted, powdery sweetness is faint but a nice undertone. The hops bitterness really dominates, especially in the finish.

The flavor is excelent; as someone before me mentioned is like a black ipa with heavily roasted malts; is complex, the notes of citrus hops intensify and are well balanced by the roasted malt, cofee, chocolate and caramel notes. It has a medium to robust body and the alcohol is well hidden.

Pours black with a large foamy and rocky brown head that takes forever to settle down and leaves clumpy lacing in its wake.

Aroma is like...well...a heavily-hopped coffee stout.  Heaps of premium coffee, chocolate, tons of roasted malts and a bit of smoke playing nicely with piney, grassy, citrusy hops.  While there is more hop presence than most other stouts, the coffee still steals the show.  Very good to great strength.

Flavor is very tasty premium coffee beans, roasted malts, chocolate up front then moves to a bitter hoppy finish featuring pine, spruce, and citrus.  A bit of sweetness with the coffee and hops teaming up for some good bitterness.  Some alcohol detected but what¬ís there is mild.

3965,"2011-04-13",4.2,"1 pint .9 fl oz bottle. This is really kind of like having breakfast with a bowl oatmeal and a cup of coffee, while replacing the OJ with an strong ipa. So much contrast of flavors on the malt to hop spectrum, yet somehow they blend together seamlessly to create both a rich and creamy yet piercingly bitter creation. The notes in the aroma may, not surprisingly, muddle together a bit though. Some strong, fresh brewed coffee, mixed cream and dark malts, full oaty grains, caramel and a mix of earth and fruity hop. Pours beautifully. Heavy, fluffy, cloud-like dark cream head, layers of lacing, wispy retention, a medium to thick body, mostly opaque, and sandy dark brown in color. As mentioned, the mouthfeel is both medium thick malted creamy and heavy bitter at the same time. My palate is both confused and really happy at the same time. Notes of oat, cream, caramel, earth, strong coffee, caramel, thick citrus, and light leafy hop. Not a bit of sugary sweetness here. The finish is sticky, bitter and lingers dark malted grain, coffee and tropical hops endlessly. I¬ím tempted to say I could do without the coffee in this, but I also fear things wouldn¬ít come together as well if is wasn¬ít there. Overall, this was a unique piece of fine beer making that takes you in all different directions. Great stuff.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"

The roasted malts and coffee are very forward as well with a sweet bitter coffee note. The body is medium with mild carbonation and overly dry. The middle is a citrus sweetness with an roasted coffee taste. Getting licorice and roasty notes. The hops are overbearing on the finish with a bitter grapefruit finish.

3965,"2011-04-12",4.3,"The pour is nearly black with a moderately full, tan, dense, creamy head which is somewhat lasting and leaves scattered, frothy lace.  The nose is lots of bitter chocolate, lighter dark roast, burnt caramel, faint campfire smoke, some cedar, but also light grapefruit, resins, and faint tropical fruit.  The flavor carries more of the Simcoe and Columbus hop notes than the nose; lighter bitter chocolate and burnt caramel, still a touch of campfire, sweet grapefruit and a faint kiwi?, rustic resin, and dark coffee roast.  The palate is medium to full, creamy and velvety, drying, and soft to lively.  The beer finishes long, dry, and highly bitter, both from dark roast but also high AA hops, lingering cedar and rustic, smoky, and a grapefruit peel.  The bitterness is high especially moving towards the finish and the acidity is moderate but seemed understated.  The dry campfire and cedar notes are the only flaws I can really find in this one, they just do not meld well with the additional hops.  Other than those minor notes, the new hops add an interesting, American Black IIPA quality to the beer.  So different from the original yet shares so many similarities.

3965,"2011-04-11",4.2,"Pours jet black with three fingers of thick tan head. A layer of carbonation remains throughout.

Roasted malts and piney hops are the first two aromas to hit the nose. They continue to dominate but are joined by a nice coffee undertone and a touch of sweetness.

The beer is bitter - in a good way - both from the coffee and from the hop presence. You can a lot more coffee in the taste compared to the nose. I taste dark chocolate and roasty malts as well. The finish is bitter as well. I could see how some people wouldn¬ít like the mix of hops and coffee but this works really well for me. 

The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy as you¬íd expect from an oatmeal stout. Carbonation was light but appropriate for the style.

I love the ""Breakfast"" and here it is in a ""fresh"" version. Can a stout be fresh? - well, this one is.

3965,"2010-05-07",3.6,"Bottle. Pours black with a creamy beige/brown head. Decent lacing. Aroma is tart, roasted and with citrus hops ¬ñ a nice blend. Flavour is pretty much the same, but with a very bitter finish; tart with a bit of coffee, lots of liquorice and a lingering dryness. Could be quite alright, but it feels somewhat unbalanced, although it grew on me a bit. Still, not as good as the aroma. 06-05-10.","Frederikssund, DENMARK","NosirIwont"

Pours completely black with a giant, staying, creamy, light-beige head. Fine lacings. World-class hoppy roasted aroma with coffee and dark chocolate. The hops are fruity, piney, lemony. Some sweet oats pop through as well. Medium carbonation, nice dry and creamy mouthfeel. At first, it seemed a tad spritzy, but after letting it settle, it gets much better. Flavour is super as well.

3965,"2010-03-06",4.0,"50 cL bottle. Pours dark brown to black, dense, creamy and tan head - leaving a nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is smooth coffee and distinct floral to grapefruity hoppy. Initial flavour impression is an overload of hops. As the tastebuds start to adjust to this the smooth coffee becomes more apparent. A bit lighter body texture than the normal Beer Geek Breakfast. The combination of the dark malt, solid grapefruity hops and coffee really gives a nice black ipa. Bitter, dry, fruity and slight herbal coffee flavoured finish. Lovely.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
