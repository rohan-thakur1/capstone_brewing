3856,"2017-06-17",4.5,"Picked this upper as a growler fill earlier today. Pours into a two finger nearly bleached-white head that laces the glass. Tree Houses notes lemon-lime up front; however, Im getting a ton of pineapple notes here. The optics are cloudy. The bitterness and mouthfeel are spot-on. If I had it on tap at my house Id never leave.","Connecticut, USA","shobramberg"

3856,"2017-06-03",4.0,"16 oz can. Pours a hazy, glowing golden orange color and topped by a small off white layer of foam that settles in quickly to a thin film and leaves sudsy streaks of lace around the glass. The aroma is very tropical fruit forward showing notes of juicy orange, tangerine, peach, and mango along with some floral and dank hop characters over a sweet bready malt base. The flavor follows suit and shows more of the juicy tropical fruits with orange, tangerine, pineapple, and peach most prominent to go with the soft bready malts and ample citrus and resinous hop bitterness on the backend. Medium bodied and almost pillowy soft on the palate with average carbonation that leads to a bitter sweet and juicy tropical fruit finish. Really well done IPA with that signature Tree House mouthfeel to it. Tasty stuff and another stellar IPA from the guys at Tree House.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
3856,"2017-05-30",4.3,"(Can kindly shared by Flavio, in a queue at Mikkeller and Friends Bottle Shop) ~1mo at drinking. Shamelessly consumed from a can in a queue, looked a hazy medium orange peering through the top though! Aroma was big sticky resinous fruit, pineapple, ripe mango, orange rind, citrus oils, leafy, dank, touch of pine. Flavour is fruity but balances juice with big leafy, resinous hop cone character while keeping bitterness rather low. Notes of pineapple, mandarin, fresh pine, mango, leafy, intense, pretty dry overall. Medium-full mouthfeel, average carb. Even from a rather improvised serving in a bottle purchase queue, this beer made a big impression.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

Aromat ananasowo-cytrusowy, raczej więcej tropikòw. Gładziutki, smukły, wspaniały sok tropikalno-cytusowy, gdzieś tam też pęta się żywica. Cudnie wytrawne.

Podsumowując ciało i wygląd to totalna NEPIA - pół do klasy wyżej niż GBG. Aromat trudny do ogarnięcia, mając na uwadze chmielenie Galaxy. Powiem tak, rozpatrując to pod kątem klimatów cytrusowo-żywicznych jest bardzo dobrze - klasa światowa. Jak ktoś oczekuje masy owoców tropikalnych i tego typu doznań, jak to ma miejsce w 90% NEIPa dostępnych na rynku, to się może zawieść. Na pewno solidna NEIPA, wytrawna z dużą dawką owoców cytrusowych - bardziej zorientowanych w kierunku pomarańczy/mandarynek.","Sosnowiec, POLAND","BlazerT"

3856,"2017-04-01",4.1,"Had this from a pour at the brewery. First thing you notice is how hazy and dank it is, it looks like grapefruit juice more than beer. Very unfiltered and gnarly in a good way. It smells wonderful, floral, piney. The taste is a lupilous haze of fruity hops with light drizzles of bitterness, very drinkable and delicate. Overall, it went down easy, left a strong impression, and left you begging for more. Hope to get some cans of this one next time!

It has a lot of the tropical fruits I expected, like pineapple and guava and tangerine. It also has some dank herbs in the aroma, with doughy malts - doughy in a way that suggests flour, even. Same for the flavor, giving it a bit of chalkiness to the texture. The flavor also has a bit more malt and fruity, resinous sweetness than the aroma, as well. Mango-melon. Medium-bodied, with soft, modest carbonation. A little sticky and a little dry on the finish.

Dank, green and citrusy, this IPA offers everything you want when in need of raw, unabashed New World hoppiness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A thin veil of foam floats atop the very hazy blond.
-Aroma is very enticing.
-Mouthfeel is almost mealy, like freshly pressed orange juice. Works well for hop flavour, but doesnt let you perceive anything else.
-A slightly doughy foundation is tasted as well.
-This is very much in line with The Alchemist and Hill Farmstead-like IPAs.

An excellent example of Galaxy hopping, but in my opinion too restrained. I mean, OK, its not calling itself a DIPA the way Bright does, so I shouldnt be expecting that level of hop bomb goodness - but this, though hoppy, is positively polite, and really isnt sharply bitter like the commercial description claims. If the references are to be believed, this thing has a much higher IBU rating than Bright (90, versus Brights 75), but despite the forbidding opaque orange juice-like appearance, its soft-bodied and mild, bitter but not aggressive. Batch variations, maybe, but its not quite what I was expecting. I guess it boils down to me marking this down because its too easy to drink? (16/20)","CANADA","UXO"

The pour is a light, bright orange juice with a thick collar of white head and a few strong spots of lace. Aside from the juice, this looks pretty good. The aroma is awesome. There is a ton of hops and bitterness. There is an excellent juiciness and a wonderful citrus. Just so juicy and hoppy. This should be magnificent. The flavor is SO juicy! There is an explosion of hops and citrus juice. This is absolutely magnificent. There is a heavy hop dominance and a strong juiciness. This is just awesome. It's one dimensional, but that's what I expect in an IPA. The mouth feel is a little thick and creamy with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly juicy hoppy aftertaste. This is a great IPA.

I drink it right after Julius, and I honestly could only barely tell the two apart because my taste buds were so overwhelmed by the hops.

3856,"2016-01-10",4.4,"Pours a completely clouded grapefruit juice color with a big, spongy head. Actually, this beer looks pretty neat in its own, headstrong, dirty way.

On the nose, a blend of resin and prickly lemon pulp creates the foundation of the aromas in this. An oat sweetness, together with a bready malt appeal provides a subtle, but well integrated balance, maintaining the focus almost entirely on the hops. Fruity lemon zest settles on top of this, blending into sweeter, not yet ripe, exotic fruits.

While not being too vivid on the carbonation, the mouthfeel completely soothes out any possible harshness from the profound hops, establishing an astonishing softness on the tongue, which tends to turn almost creamy during the finish.

Tastes of a soft aqueous quality up front, already establishing the beers gorgeous mouthfeel, with juicy lime cutting through in a very refreshing, playful way, allowing the flavor foundation to unfold its silkiness peaceable. Citrus blends into fruity, sweet sorbet, somewhere between woodruff jello, ripe orange and fresh cut grass in a cloudburst. Finishes with its already mentioned, yet defining, soft mouthfeel, mellowing all other flavors of the beer down to a minimum, only to invite a water melon accompanied hop dryness to the tongue, which lasts for decades.

Doubtlessly this beer is green. That is due to its unique sorbet-like middle part, as for its initial lime dryness and late grass dankness. These three flavors create a highly enjoyable synergy, guided by the world class mouthfeel in this, opening up the term softness to a whole new level. The more the beer warms up, the more obvious becomes its uncompromising hop onslaught, getting balanced by the beers smoothness instead of creating a malty backbone, preventing a hindering, hop decreasing sweetness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

This would be my first experience with Tree House and based on the data point Ill have to hunt them if I might be nearby. It has the hallmarks of a solidly made East Coast IPA and captures the essence of the tropics transported to the eastern seaboard.

Aroma / Appearance - A rosy body glows with the warmth of a yellow sun. Fruity aspects, like a glass full of tropical fruits, floats up into the air with a focus on pineapple and lemons. Sweet natured, it does stick.

Flavor / Palate - The immediate fruitiness sets the tone for the entire experience. An easy drinking beer balances the burst of hops so that you are never fatigued. If I could procure a couple cans this beer would be making the rounds to a few locals.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3856,"2015-10-22",3.9,"Milky dandelion yellow appearance. Vegetal and fruit rind and nut skin aroma, though lacking any acridity; the white rind of honeydew, scallion and garlic scape, celery seed. Grass-fed butter notes blend in. Nettles and pineapple acidity in the very bitter but well-polished flavor. Green peppercorns, bits of salt, dried crispy herbs; generally aggressive, noisy spiciness. Texturally crisp initially, wet and juicy in the middle; ascendant mango sweetness nearing the finish, where the zinging acidity of citrus oils and tropical fruits eventually fades into a papery, greenish dryness. Dank vegetal notes do tend to displace the sunny citrus ones, but the top-shelf quality expected of this brewery is obvious.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

3856,"2015-10-06",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 31, 2016 Fresh cans from the brewery, drunk August/September 2015.Fantastic pour shows plentiful white head atop a lightly hazy golden body. Good retention.Phenomenal amounts of tropical fruit in the nose, very juicy and enjoyable, with only light honey in the background, lightly balancing. Fortunately, theres not too much to balance, as its very, very low on the resin/pine/heavy citrus. Only a touch of grapefruit/lemon, but mostly pineapple and watermelon. Clean, lovely, no flaws/alcohol.In the mouth its more delightful tropical fruits, with a spicy element to it (not sure what hop thats from), some light caramel and a tight carbonation and supple malt body. A bit of citric bitterness/dryness builds up over the course of the can, and theres a little bit too much tanginess. As well, I could do without some of this caramel stickiness. But this is just nitpicking. By and large a fantastic, delicious beer.Canned 8/19/16, drunk 8/25/16.Maybe the best of the four we had from Tree House this night (Haze, Eureka Citra, Doppelganger and this).  Like Haze, its very much balanced by the maltiness and ultra-soft, fine carbonation, as well as the relative lack of resin/low bitterness.  Lovely galaxy-like spiciness lingers long on the finish, with tons of melon, pineapple and mango.  Like Haze, I can see it getting a bit too malty if one were to drink a few cans, and so in that vein, I vastly prefer the lower abv stuff like Eureka (and even Julius and its variants are lower in maltiness).  Almost no tanginess/pine/resin that I remember from the fresh cans I had prior to this, though those were also drunk one-two days old instead of six.  Regardless, still a fantastic beer and a true homage to the Galaxy hop.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3856,"2015-05-17",4.6,"Tree House Brewing out of Monson, Massachusetts seems to be the it brewery of the moment around here. Based on this beer alone I can see why, as its brewed very much in the New England-style IPA, which is trendy and popular now. I dont mind if a beer is trendy just as long as its good, and in the case of Green it most definitely is good (much more than good, actually).

I poured a 16oz can into a tulip glass. There was no freshness date. Thanks to Jason for the can!

Appearance: Pale orange hue over an extremely murky/opaque body. Looks like an Orange Julius. Pours to a large, white, frothy head which laces and retains tremendously.

Smell: Extremely clean, bright, fruity aroma  especially of pineapple and orange juice. A slight grassy/herbal note can be found, too.

Taste: There definitely is a difference between a highly-hopped beer and a beer thats hopped with finesse and style and this is a great example of that. The citrusy/tropical fruit aromas carry over to the palette perfectly. Almost sweet or even tart at first with pineapple and orange flavors. But its also significantly bitter. Juicy up front, but more grassy and herbal spiciness on the finish. The ability to make that transition is what separates the good IPAs from the great ones. Not much in the way of distinct malt character other than a general pale base. Thats okay, because the final product is so delicious and enjoyable I dont mind that its not perfectly balanced.

Drinkability: When I saw Tree House Green pouring out of the can I thought it looked like an orange milkshake. When I drank it, it thought it kind of felt like a milkshake, too. The body is so smooth and velvety  almost like a nitro stout. Though its certainly crisp on the backend, which makes it almost self-cleaning (the hops do linger on the tongue, though). At 7.5% ABV its certainly a strong beer, but in no way intimidating. I had to hold myself back from slugging it all down at once.
