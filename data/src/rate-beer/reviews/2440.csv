Thanks to MartinT for sharing a rare ice cider. Ive been meaning to try one but they are either hard to track down or exceedingly expensive. Based on this one data point I might have to buy another one for special occasions. 

Aroma / Appearance - The flat golden base is not carbonated at all although this isnt shocking for a cider. The long icy legs are like the last vestiges of winter ice sliding down a cliff face. Bread pudding, apples, and sherry give it a thick texture similar to an ice wine. Overall this is very much a nightcap.

Flavor / Palate - The dry texture coats the palate after just two sips. Sherry, warm apple crisp, and lemon zest is both fruity and vinous. I can see why these are hard to come by but I might have to purchase another for a special event. Everyone should try an ice cider at least once.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Nose: apples and pears  naturally sweet and naturally intense. Musk skirts along the edges. Apple and cherry skins. Kiwi, dried apricots and dried peaches.

Palate: cherries and apples are the glue that holds everything together. Apple sweetness followed by crisp apple skins and dry nutty slightly tannic seeds. A bit thin but also very complex and full. Tingle of acidity in the middle with sweetness of pears, peaches, kiwi, and apricots along the edges. Sticky lips. Essence of the orchard in my breath.

Legs are dense and sparsly dispersed. Aroma is of apple infused Cognac, rich sugar, velvety candies of the minty persuasion, tart notes that tingle the nose and citrus fruits infused with grain alcohol. The alcoholic notes are headstrong and intersect at random intervals with ethereal nuances, simulating a diffusion of uncanny nature of alcohol into once pristine apple cider. An ongoing and ultra-complex, late, massive fruit explosion captivates upon first sip. A touch of alcohol warming is detected, one not noticed in many other top grade ice ciders. Moderate acidity cuts softly through the sweet and light-medium body. Some graininess is noted in the mouthfeel, along with a confusing dash of white pepper Ill attribute to the alcoholic warmth. The finish is lively and lengthy, but the intensity fades too quickly, leaving a warm apple sting in the back of the throat. Very good, but flawed in many aspects.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
2440,"2007-05-04",3.8,"Courtesy boboski.  My first ice cider.  Clear yellow color, looks pretty thick in the glass.  Crisp tart apple aroma with no real significant alcohol aromas present until after it warmed a bit.  The taste begins with a general sweetness, but the finish has a big flush of tartness and a bit of alcohol.  Hard to compare this to anything else, but it was enjoyable.  Will adjust rating as I get more ice ciders.","Florida, USA","JMFG"
2440,"2007-05-04",3.9,"Courtesy boboski by way of MartinT.  Pours a yellow golden color, a little syrupy and rich looking.  A ton of apple and plum fruit aromas, just a hint of alcohol and a smudge of cinnamon characters in the smell.  Very sweet apple taste, big mouthfeel, a little syrupy and oily.  Tastes a little sour, but granny smith apples just keep coming to mind.  Extremely smooth, hides the alcohol very well.  Very tasty treat, would go great for an after dinner cider.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
2440,"2006-12-17",4.3,"Brown sugar, cinnamon and apple sauce in the leafy aroma along with a hint of alcohol.  Clear, deep golden in colour with a viscous, thick appearance and nice legs on the glass.  Sweetness up front with some appleskin tartness in the finish.  Alcohol is quite apparent but never distracting and suffuses its way throughout the flavour.  Although it almost seems to sweet at first, the interplay between the sweetness and the tartness is quite elegant.  Medium body is velvety smooth in texture and sticky on the lips.  Pleasantly warming and very enjoyable!  Ice cider glass.  Cellar temperature.  Bottle (50ml, SAQ at Jean Talon Market, Aug-06).","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
2440,"2006-12-03",3.5,"50mL SAQ bottle. Clear, lightly pale golden cider, still. Somehow, this is less inspiring than I expected it to be. The main reason is probably the rather boozy nature which captures our attention and seems to hinder a bit the underneath complexity which never really develops the prolific promises one expects when sipping an ice cider. Otherwise, while not as slick as some, it remains an highly concentrated offering, with plenty of residual sugars from the apple and a decent tartish backbone to balance. Very sweet even for an ice cider and just does not really let me put any other words to it than sweet and apple despite a certain elegance to it.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2440,"2006-08-31",4.2,"50 ml bottle (from the SAQ at Marche Jean Talon, Montreal) served out of the fridge in a Face Cachee la Pomme glass.  Faint legs die like speedy icicles above the clear, whisky-gold thick body....potent, sharp sugared apples with the faintest tartness underlying and whispers of alcohol in the intoxicating nose....very sweet and smooth on the tongue, no alcoholic harshness, thick and lightly syrupy, oaky with hints of sour cherry and almond, quite complex and supremely elegant....a light acidic tartness and even somehow crispness -- if that can be possible in such a liqueurish treat -- help to elevate this near the top of the hieararchy of ice ciders.  Wonderful.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2440,"2006-06-28",3.3,"Bottle. Pours a dull yellow body with no head. Apple softness is prevalent in the aroma - mostly tart but there are some sugar undertones and bread. Again, it’s sweet but quite nice and flavourful - apple sugariness on the lips. I probably wouldn’t drink a lot of this but it’s good for what it is.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"
2440,"2006-06-27",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2006 Bottle shared with my lovely wife. Bright golden colour. Lucious aroma of concentrated apples. Flavour strikes a great balance between sweet and tart, and has a very warm finish. A great sipper, very nice.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
2440,"2006-06-18",3.8,"Golden yellow body with a very sweet alcoholic aroma. Fairly big apple notes and lightly tart. Surprising amount of tart acidity rounds out a healthy does of sugary apple sweetness. Decent complexity and balance. Medium to full bodied palate.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
2440,"2006-06-10",4.0,"Amazing blend of apple peel tartness and citrus fruit splashing onto the unsuspecting nostrils...Flavor is an ingenious continuation of the aroma, a most intriguing and well-crafted union of lactic tartness and delicate honeyed sweetness...A breathtaking trio of ice ciders from Lafrance, all with different personalities which deserve to be discovered...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

2440,"2005-11-17",3.3,"Pours a clear golden color. Sweet aroma of baked apples. Interesting medium intensity flavor of baked apples with a dominant sweetness. The body feels very light, more than what Im used with ice cider, the texture is liquorous. Interesting.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
