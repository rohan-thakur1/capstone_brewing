3509,"2010-05-23",4.2,"Bottle.

A - Dark mahogany with definite ruby streaks. Full, large, frothy, creamy, sticky, off cream color with very good retention leaving a thick layer of creamy lace.

S - Sweet, earthy nut flavors strongest with some background hints of chocolate. Some strong dark and caramel malt aroma as well. Very faint dark fruit (and general fruitiness) underneath it all.

T - Interesting mix of different English flavors. Initially there is a lot of earthy and nutty taste with mild dark and caramel malt bringing some sweetness. Some chocolate malt and a bit of a roasted feel, somewhat similar to an English Stout with more coming out mid-sip. Some grassy and earthy hops come out.

M - Medium to light body with a little below average carbonation. Fairly smooth.

D - Quite drinkable with a nice mix of dark mild and stout flavors. Light and easy on the tongue but it has enough complexity to be interesting that builds as you drink it.

Notes: Best before 28/August/2010. Very enjoyable beer to drink. Its definitely English although I dont think it fits neatly into a style. Well balanced and very enjoyable beer. Worth grabbing one if you can.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"
