1900,"2013-07-24",3.4,"Just finished their American Pale Ale and did not like it, so lets hope this one is much better (as I do like all of their other brews).

Hoppy nose at first, but after breathing, fruit malt come out to balance the grassy aromas. Medium-bodied with a some light dryness in the finish. Bitter and grassy flavours with the fruity and mild grain malts. So, much better than their American Pale Ale. Just not sure this one is an English-style one, as the hop is way present.

Sweet malts are almost lost in the hop load, fruity and perfumey, and the finish is surprisingly bitter-- seems like more than 45 IBUs to me.

RERATE 7/3/09: 500mL bottle from Willis Metro New World. Pours hazy golden/amber.
Aroma is subtle in its flavours but by no means weak. Fruity esters dominate, some apple and spices with a caramel like malt there.
Flavour is well balanced between toffee malt and a sharp hop bitterness, with the latter lingering into the finish for quite some time. Those 45 IBUs do come through.
Enjoyable, the only thing detracting from my enjoyment is the sharpness of the hops.","Wellington, New Zealand, NEW ZEALAND","donfardz64"

1900,"2007-08-17",3.5,"A good pale ale which could be great. Theres an ""off"" character to the aroma which I cant quite place, which is a shame, as its otherwise a nice mix of citrus, pine, and sweet malt. The flavour is similar to the aroma, though without any detectable off-notes. Just a hit of green apples which Im not sure should be there. Theres a very nice hint of mangos there too. Unusual, but very welcome. A slightly thin mouthfeel and a shorter-than-Id-like finish also lose a mark or two. Im sure there is a fantastic beer here trying to get out. Ill be retrying it regularly.","Hamilton, NEW ZEALAND","greig"

1900,"2006-11-18",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 24, 2008 Retasted 07/06/2008.  I always liked the darker offerings and Renaissance are hitting their straps with the pale beers now too. Full malt character, big hop flavour, massive bitterness. Perhaps a shade too carbonated to let the flavours show through. It has all the positives of below without the fermentation issues. Good work.  Tasted 17/11/2006. Half at The Malthouse, Wellington. Pours an almost bright deep gold, thending amber, with a white head that thins out. Sweet caramel malts and tropical fruit notes, at first, but these get overwhelmed by a green apple aroma, reminiscent of sour apple chews, that dominates through the glass.  Big weighty mouthfeel carries little in the way of interesting malt characters and a very strong nettle-like bitterness.  Finishes very short, with a little more green apple on th palate.  The fourth time I’ve tried this and the green apples have definitely dominated the last three samples.  I like what they are trying to do with this pale ale but something’s not quite working.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","yalnikim"

I wouldnt be surprised if this beer has been influenced by Roger Pink of the Pink Elephant Brewery as its aroma features Golden Tusks signature peach notes but has a caramalised character of its own.  The body is fruity with orange and citrus flavours and a distinct grapefruit-peel bitterness that grows into the long dry finish.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","rgrep"
