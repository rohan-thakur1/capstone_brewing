635,"2017-02-18",3.9,"2016 bottle. Dark beer with some mahogany hues around the edges. Thin grayish beige head that shrank to a small slick. Subtle wood, strawberry and chocolate nose. This has the smooth lactic sense in the base beer, with strawberry fruitiness, milk chocolate, vanilla and an added extra wet oak flavor. Understated use of a barrel in this one. It mostly comes out in an alcohol evaporation in the finish.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

635,"2016-06-17",3.9,"12 ounce bottle, packaged on date printed on label says 04/14/16, 6.1% ABV. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like neapolitan ice cream (chocolate, strawberry, vanilla), along with some nuttiness. Dont pick up any barrel character in the aroma at all. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there is some whiskey and vanilla noticeable in the taste, but it isnt very strong. I cant imagine this spent too much time in a barrel. But with that being said, I do like the taste of this brew (I did like the regular neapolitan milk stout). Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. Im glad I got to try this and I thought it was good, but I am disappointed there wasnt more barrel character noticeable in the taste or aroma, and what barrel was there just seemed very subtle to me. $5.99 a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

635,"2015-11-05",4.3,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, 2015 vintage bottling. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big strawberry, vanilla, cream, milk chocolate, cocoa, toffee, toasted oak, light-moderate bourbon, and oak/roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, strawberry/vanilla, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Smells identical to ice cream. Taste of big strawberry, vanilla, cream, milk chocolate, cocoa, toffee, toasted oak, light-moderate bourbon, and oak/roasted earthiness. Light-moderate roasted bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of strawberry, vanilla, cream, milk chocolate, cocoa, toffee, toasted oak, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fasntastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, strawberry/vanilla, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/silky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged stout stout! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, strawberry/vanilla, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth and easy to sip on with the modest ABV. The bourbon character was lower than expected but still noticeable; and the barrel intensified the vanilla/cream notes making this taste identical to real ice cream across the board. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Faint oak. medium/full body. Really oily texture. Sweet finish. Really tasty but I cannot rate this higher because it is a barrel aged stout.

The pour is a dark brown to light black with a couple signs of head (light spots of film) and no lace. The aroma is definitely Neapolitan ice cream with a little barrel stave. There is a good dried vanilla and chocolate present, with a beautiful strawberry that is more dominant than the others. A light bourbon is present, but it really smells like Dippinâ Dots Neapolitan with a little bourbon barrel character added in. The flavor is good. Itâs a lot of dried strawberry ice cream with a hint of bourbon and a barrel influenced vanilla. Chocolate and a light roasted malt finish it up nicely. The aroma was definitely a lot better with this one. The mouth feel is thinner and a good carbonation helps it stick around when it doesnât seem like it should be memorable.

Smells like a berries & crème mélange with undertones of roasty cacao beans. Plenty of creamy & milky sweetness on the nose. Doesnt really smell barrel aged, though. Flavor comes out swinging similarly hard with strawberry up front followed by a semisweet drizzle of chocolate syrup. Vanilla is the lightest of the trifecta, but shows up lightly in the latter half of each sip. Cream, milk, & lactose sweetness are all apparent. It really does remind you of ice cream in a strange way. This is potentially more ""full"" or robust than the original version in body & boldness of flavor, but I still dont get any notable barrel notes. Good stuff.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
