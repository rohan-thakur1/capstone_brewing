Lots of complexity in the flavor, very slighty fruit, florals, peanut. Very very tasty.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

1620,"2004-08-23",3.1,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2008 [heated carafe] Id never had any sort of sake before, so I really didnt know what to expect. When this arrived, it came in a ceramic carafe and it was steaming hot. I always thought you were supposed to drink sake room temperature, not hot. So I poured some in the ochoko and waited for it to cool. When I drank it it tasted a little too sweet and yeasty for my taste. Thats when my friend said that its better hot. So I tried it hot. Completely transparent and colorless. It had a very sweet and fermented aroma that almost smelled like raisins. Initial taste was very sweet that gave way to a smooth and sweet yeast flavor. Very warming going down and left a nice, sweet aftertaste. A very good first sake experience.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"
1620,"2004-02-03",3.2,"I've had better sake but have no idea what they were. I sampled this at Waldo's Campus Tavern at a beer tasting. We actually made Japanese Car Bombs, dropping a shot of this sake into a glass of Sapporo and downing it. Different, but quite nice.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","thehoff"
