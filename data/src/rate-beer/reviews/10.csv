10,"2016-08-06",3.5,"12 ounce bottle from Badger Spirits in Beloit, WI, served in a New Glarus weizen glass at cellar temp or so. Huge pop when the cap comes off, and it pours an enormous gout of foam, which subsides fairly quickly atop the lightly oily-cloudy golden body...on the nose, its bubblegum-bubblegum-bubblegum; I dont often use that word, maybe because I was never a bubblegum guy and havent chewed it for decades, but this beer more than any other I can remember brought me back to the days of Bubble Yum, Bubblicious, and especially Bazooka and the Bazooka Joe comics. Man, the memories! Who knew that bubblegum aroma in a weizenbock is my madeleine? Anyway theres also some banana and I could swear some mint in this utterly entrancing nose, and I keep going at it for minutes, forgetting to drink, reveling in the past...finally I take a sip, and (no surprise), the rose-colored glasses are off, and Im back to the present, and not 8 years old again asking for another quarter to put in the candy machine for another pack of Bazooka Joe, just inside the entrance to the Beloit Kohls grocery store...sigh...its decent enough, with that bready malt fairly rich, sweet - perhaps too sweet - but with enough sourness coming through on the end to keep it from getting TOO cloying, or it would be if not for the rather low carbonation level...finishes sweet, bready, thick. I have the feeling this bottle was a little old - a mix-a-six bottle and I think this is one of the lesser-selling varieties, at least at this store. Hey, Im burping gum! If a bubble should come out, thisll get a 5.0. Wait for it...sigh...no. You cant go home again.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

After awhile, it kind of becomes reminiscent of banana bread as some of the grains come through. Theres oranges in there too, as well as a light acetone touch (but that could be from the unintentional aging). It looks like a hefe; its a hazy, unfiltered yellow-gold color with big, creamy, frothy white head that excellently retains a thick, fuzzy ring with an island and leaves and abundant, messy, puffy lace. Its a balanced medium sweet and bitter with just a touch of citrus sour. Theres a light zip to the carbonation on this thin, smooth, light bodied beer. Its an easy drinker with notes of apple scone early, followed by spicy honey, some banana, and bread late. Spice and honey finish the beer and it leaves a sweet fruit and light bitter citrus aftertaste with some wheat notes. Its crisp, dry, and touch astringent.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

10,"2014-06-30",3.1,"12 oz. bottle, consumed on 6-29-14. Yeasty aroma features scents of bubblegum, banana bread, and chlorine. Pretty good hefeweizen/weizenbock smell. Theres not a lot to the smell, but it is pleasant. The aroma is on the dry side for the style. Pours a hazy bronze or medium tan with a moderate amount of beige head. Produces short-lasting lacing. Flavors of lemon and white vinegar. Tastes sharper and tarter than is typical for the style. Banana bread aftertaste. Lively, dusty, frothy palate. Good palate for the style, but the body is too light to stand out among all beers. Overall, New Glarus Dancing Man Wheat is actually a below average American hefeweizen, if one considers it that, and an even further below average weizenbock and stands as a major disappointment. I love a good German-style wheat beer in the summer, and I had heard this is a great one, but it is not even close to that reputation. This stands as another disappointment from a brewery with a ton of goodwill among craft beer fans but that struggles to produce outstanding beers aside from their truly special fruit concoctions and a small proportion of their Thumbprint Series brews.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Lemon is the first thing I notice in the palate and is prevalent throughout. A little bit of bubblegum and pepper make their way in and it finishes heavily spicy from clove.

Mouthfeel is spot on. A bit creamy and the higher than normal ABV for a Hefe helps.

Very good beer, but pales in comparison to the Live Oak I had last week. I prefer less clove in my Hefes and this one is centered around clove. That said, its not way out of balance and the lemon flavors do a pretty good job of balancing out the spice. Will definitely seek this out again.","Indiana, USA","jmarsh123"

The beer is hazy, appearing golden yellow hued with a towering white head. Excellent retention and lacing. An all around stellar appearance. The aroma is sweet, with prominent banana scents. Very nice flavor, albeit sweeter than is customary for the style, though typical of New Glarus. Lots of banana and sweet malt. Not as refreshing or quaffable as a lighter, traditional hefeweizen, but certainly tasty and delicious. Light to medium bodied, with alcohol content well disguised. Wow, this is 7.2%? Overall, quite enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this beer. Another gem from New Glarus.

10,"2012-03-07",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 9/3/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into my New Glarus Weizen glass.

Dancing Man provides a very large cream colored head, full of life and bursting bubbles. Initially it is actually a struggle to pour the whole beer as the head is very aggressive. The head slowly fades but still maintains a small creamy cap for the duration. Good lacing on the side of the glass as well. The beer is golden in color with the narrower parts of the glass being a little bit lighter. 

Creamy banana, biscuit and bready malt, and some clove and spice for good measure.

The flavor starts sweet and stays fairly sweet throughout. The malt is fairly sweet, reminiscent of biscuits and honey. The banana flavor is present the whole time, participating in the sweetness as well. The spiciness from the yeast creates a clove flavor, which serves as a segue into the finish, which actually dries out just a bit. The nice thing about that is that it prevents the flavor from becoming cloying.

Even with an ABV on the higher side for the style, the body stays solidly in the middle of the spectrum. The carbonation falls somewhere between creamy and crisp. A little bit sticky sweet.

Overall, this is definitely a top notch hefe.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Full bodied with a really nice balance of zesty spice, bready yeast, light fruit and citrus. Like the aroma, there is a ton of zesty spice up front with a strong clove presence that lingers throughout into a slightly tart, dry finish. This is countered by the yeast presence that adds fullness to the palate and gives off hintsnof bread and banana. Toward the finish there is some more sweetness with a nice lemon/orange peel flavor. Excellently balanced, very flavorful and refreshing with no trace of alcohol making it dangerously drinkable. Probably the best American interpretation of the style.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

10,"2011-03-07",3.7,"12 oz brown bottle, the summer seasonal for New Glarus.

It pours into my generic Weizen glass a pale, light gold with orange hinting at the top and a ribbon of yeast. The head is foamy and massive, a white mountain brimming over the lip of the glass. It takes a bit to recede leaving some decent lacing.

The smell is almost pure bubble gum, there are hints of clove and banana, but mostly pink bubblegum. It seems to get more clovey as you sniff, but it has a strong bubblegum scent, especially when you sniff out of the bottle.

The flavor is more of a lemon/clove mixture, it has a deep spiciness that tickles the back of your throat. The mouthfeel is a bit thick and undercarbonated for the style, reminiscent of a weizenbock. The drinkability also suffers per the style because of this, but only slightly.

It is a wild hefeweizen, not quite authentically Bavarian, but pretty close.

Slightly full bodied up front, but the finish sees a nice tartness become noticeable that helps to lighten up the finish of this beer quite a bit.  Up front flavors of banana are coupled with the classic note of clove that lingers in the finish.  The tartness in the finish brings out some flavors of apple in the finish, perhaps even a hint of citrus or lime that is more from the yeast and wheat than from hops.  Hops actually arent really a contributor here, which is as it should be, though there is a soft bitterness that is accentuated by a peppy carbonic effervescence and bite.  This definitely has the fullness that I like to find in a good Hefeweizen, but it is also quite a bit stronger than a traditional example, so it should be.

I will admit to wanting to be blown away by this beer, so much so that I was quite critical of the first bottle of this that I had.  This second bottle has settled in a bit better, but I have still had better examples.  This one is quite good though; and this might not be as fresh as the best that I have had.  In the end this is a nicely satisfying Hefewiezen; too soon I find my glass empty and I am wanting for more.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
10,"2010-09-16",4.2,"This pours a golden color with a thick fluffy head.  Scattered lacing coats the glass after practically each sip.  The aroma shows cinnamon, cloves, flowers, herbs, slight lemon and vanilla.  Not one seemingly overpowering the other as this comes together for a really nice scent.  The flavor mostly follows that.  Spicy but delicate.  Bubblegum, clove, spices, banana.  Slick vanilla backing giving it a slightly creamy feel.  Some hops that dry it out a little in the finish.

This beer pours slightly darker orange in comparison, and the head is not as whimsical as the weihenstephan, I would say its more like hoegaarden in comparison, with less of the lacing. This brew does not smell ""exactly"" like your typical hefeweizen as other users state - a citrus note tends to shine through , with less of the yeasty ester banana feel and less of the funk. Flavors are very similar,  the citrus note is striking at first, but it moves into the more typical flavors of hefeweizen with that hint of cinnamon as well. It seems to taste slightly bitter at the end, and the carbonation seems greater as well.

Smell is a very fruity. Bananas are the strongest noted, with touches of cloves. Taste is similiar and very great in that manner. I never was the biggest hefeweizen fan, but this really makes a person appreciate the style more. For some reason the taste of bananas in a beer is awesome. You can definately taste the wheat as well. One great part about this beer is that you cannot notice the 7.2% abv.

Pours a slightly hazy golden with a couple bubble streams coming up from the bottom.  Theres a big billowy white head that recedes pretty quickly and leaves almost no lacing.

The aroma is wonderful, starting with the mixture of banana and cotton candy sweetness.  There are hints of clove in the nose and a light lemony citrus presence.  Textbook hefe aroma for me.

The taste starts out with a much more tart lemony kick than I was expecting and the wheat sweetness is much more understated in the taste.  The finish has the tartness of the lemons combined with a light spiciness that lingers on the tongue a little while.

The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and I would never, never have thought it was 7.2% ABV.  Good carbonation.

Update 9/11/11 - After going through multiple cases of this the last couple years, Id have to say either my tastes have changed, the recipe has changed, or both. This hefe is up there with the big boys, with pungent aroma and flavor, and none of the over-spiciness that I tasted back in 2009.

10,"2008-12-28",4.1,"12 oz into Discount Liquor/New Glarus shaker.  Effervescent and almost clear golden with ample billowing white head that mostly dissipates, leaving a mottled layer of bubbles on the surface.  Wonderfully rich and warm citrus smell, like freshly cut melons, swaddled in some yeasty sweetness that is not as cottony as I would expect from a wheat beer; it doesnt dampen the fresh fruits in the nose.  Nice biting carbonation delivers a dark graininess at first, before the beer foams up in the mouth and softens out.  Once it softens, the same wonderful melony sweetness from the smell dominates the finish after a burst of the mellow and somewhat-cottony wheat character.  The sweetness in the finish is lactic and mild.  No traces of acidity; this stays smooth throughout except for the initial burst of carbonation.  Unbelievable that this has 7.2%, it drinks like a very mild session beer closer to 4%.  As with almost all New Glarus beers, this one seems wonderfully crafted and flavorful, if a bit too restrained (at least for the hardcore over-the-top beer geeks).","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

This is remarkably spicy, more so than most hefe’s I have had, the banana clove thing is cranked to 11 here and this just sings with citrus notes.

Aroma of cloves are dominating with some discernable wheat and overall a quite big malt base. Taste is a mix between some cloves and some big malt base and is not as close to the style as I was expecting. Either there is too much wheat and the beer is veering toward a wheat wine or maybe there is too much barley but I thought the malt base was too sweet for the style and didnt provide enough refreshment. Also, at the risk of sounding too traditional, I would have like if more banana ester would have showed. Definitely not the best weizen out there and probably over rated and not the best beer from a very good brewer.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

Flavor is outstanding easily the best hefe I’ve ever had.  Bannana and grapefruit the dominent flavors in this one.  What makes this hefe special is the way it finishes.  It finishes so clean with a tinge of wheat and sweetness from the bannana.  Better done than the german hefes that I’ve had.  This is better than their unplugged version which I felt was a little unbalanced.  Will get more.

10,"2007-12-29",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2007 12oz bottle from CaptainCougar. Pours a deep, cloudy orange with highlights of bright gold, small wisps of drifting yeast, and a very thick (though short-lived), nearly-white head that looks almost like whipped egg whites. The aroma is almost chewy with wheat and malts. It is incredibly wheaty with some notes of banana and vinous, fruity malts. The flavor starts crisp and wheaty. There are some fruity malts (soft fruit, perhaps some banana) and a light touch of spice (allspice and mace). The middle of the tongue detects some spicy, noble hop bitterness and a slight touch of tartness. The finish is refreshing and somewhat dry. The beer ends sweet and fruity with some light balancing hops. The high level of carbonation helps hide the beers full body. The tongue detects textures that are at times silky but at other times almost oily.

first off...WOW, what a great beer!  pours a hazy, yet brilliant golden orange with a loooooong lasting orangey-white head.  after 10 minutes of sitting in illini08s weizen glass, it still had a 1/2"" pillowy head and after several sips, great lacing.  aroma seemed to be your typical german hefe, yeast, clove and some spice.  flavor and palate, this is something special!  it has it all, bubblegum, banana, yeast, clove and some spice, all blended perfectly.  anyone who has read many of my reviews, knows I dont like a lot of carbonation.  I was concerned upon pouring this one since it initially had a huge head and lots of bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass.  turns out, Dancing Man Wheat has such a soft creamy mouthfeel, it has to be experienced to be fully understood.  truly a special beer and grossly under-rated.","Quad-Cities, Illinois, USA","barleyPops"

Not one of my favorite styles but I noticed this getting rave reviews and I always look forward to trying New Glaruss new offerings so I picked some Dancing Man up. Pours a glowing hazy orange with huge amounts of carbonation exploding to the surface. A two finger eggshell head formed on the pour that became creamy as it sat without losing any size. This is really a great looking hefe.

Pretty standard aromas come from this hefe but what makes it special is it just seems more pronounced than other hefeweizens Ive had in the past. Good dose of wheat twang with a nice sprinkling of freshly squeezed orange juice. Warm banana bread and theres some mild clove in the background but the yeast adds another layer of spiciness. Begs to be drank.

Flavor is along the lines of the aroma but more subdued and seamless. Wheat is much bolder in the flavor easing into the mild clove and yeast spiciness with a solid sampling of ripe banana. Finishes with a nice toouch of juicy orange on the swallow. 

The mouthfeel is as good as I can imagine coming from a hefe. Medium bodied with an incredible smooth creaminess on the palate. Its like velvet draping my tongue.

This is a refreshing supremely enjoyable hefe that I could drink the day away.

This Is the best hefeweizen Ive drank to date and one I will continue to pick up when in season. Theres is in no way an overpowering clove presence like Ive run into with many others. New Glarus hits another homerun.

10,"2007-09-27",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 8, 2007 12 ounce bottle. Shaker glass. Cloudy yellow with a thin head. Aroma was pronounced banana and clove. This one was sharp and sweet with the typical wheat beer flavors of banana, clove and spices. The flavor was very robust and not bland like some wheat beers can be. The clove and spices stay with you for the entire beer, not like some that will tend to fade a bit as it warms. Definitely one of the better hefeweizens Ive had and an American one at that.","Edina, Minnesota, USA","BustedFlat"
10,"2007-09-27",4.0,"Slightly cloudy yellow gold appearance, very thin smoky head. Smells like banana nut bread: bananas, pecans, cinnamon, maybe nutmeg? Flavor is not the chemical dullness I always notice in hefeweizens...this one has a nice spicy note that really brings out the banana. Its almost sour, like tasting an unripe banana. Mouthfeel is as expected...average but with a touch of light body that I associate with most wheat-based beers. Really a drinkable beer to say the least. I agree with the previous rater: this IS the best hefeweizen Ive had.","West Bend, Wisconsin, USA","keoki182"

10,"2007-09-19",4.0,"Cloudy, sunset yellow-orange body.  Small, frothy off-white head that settles slowly to a bubbly, foamy rim.  Minimal spotty lacing.  The aroma shows freshly peeled bananas, clove, cinnamon, orange rind, and a faint hint of bubblegum.  Fresh cut wheat is present in the background.  Banana and lemon chiffon battle each other for top billing in the flavor.  While there is no decisive victor, the combination of the two is fantastic.  Clove, nutmeg, and various other dark spices add depth.  The palate was much more substantial than what I am used to for a Hefe.  Feels significant in the mouth.  Clean, pleasantly fruity finish.  Best Hefe Ive had to date, by a long shot.  Fantastic.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Light and refreshing, this beer does a good job of hiding the 7.2% alcohol. I can see a more than a few people dancing (or stumbling) around after a few of these. Nice use of spices, you know they are there, but overall they just add to the flavors, not be one of the flavors. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth.

Pours a cloudy golden-orange with a small orange tinged white head that is short lasting and leaves no lacing behind.  Flavor starts with a nice blend of bubblegum and banana with light yeastiness.

10,"2007-08-28",4.4,"The quintessential wheat beer appearance and pour from the bottle. Looks like peach-apricot juice, multi-hued orange, just exquisite. Tiny bubbles stream upwards and support a mid-sized, very creamy and fantastically retained head. I could go on for paragraphs about how perfect this appearance is. I poured it in the kitchen and as I walked quickly to the living room to begin rating it, a jetstream of banana notes infiltrated the air I waded through. The nose is very seducing silky wheat malt, mild but glowing bananas, light clove and very light alcohol. Milder notes of lemon peel, orange and bready malts, with just a touch of cereal grain. Simple, near perfect for the style and as quenching as an aroma could be. Alcohol is more prevalent in the flavor but doesnt indicate a flawed aspect of the taste, rather its so high to be this well integrated it nearly unbelievable. Banana creme pie and vanilla roll across the tongue first, followed by silky wheat, very light tropical fruit notes and light yeast. No astringency at all, very little acidity. The palate is silken, soft, caressing, stunning. If it were any softer youd never know it was there, but for lively and very compacted carbonation. Light spice in the finish, banana lingering on and fading steadily and slowly. This is absolutely amazing!!! New Glarus brews wheat beers as good as they as they have ever been, anywhere, and I can yell that from the highest peak or in the most crowded room with 100% confidence. A mind-blowing experience, especially considering the style.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Huge banana and orange citrus fruits fill the air around the top of the glass with the wheat esters balancing them out fully.  Really inviting smell.  Just a flutter of some cinnamon spice shows up during a big inhalation that makes the mouth almost water.  Very creamy texture, seems almost perfectly balanced.  The wheat really takes a hold of the reigns in the flavor, with the banana and orange taking their spot in the backseat to give moral support.  The cinnamon also clings around too to give it a little zest and spiciness.  The finish is long and soothing, with a semi-sweet little aftertaste.  Really well done wheat.  I need to get more of this.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"

Medium sweet maltiness backed by a pleasent fruitiness, bananna, a hint of apple, lightly spicey, clovey and some caramel malts hiding in there also. Fairly dry fruity finish. A solid Hefe for sure.

Sweet banana, orange, lemon, wheat and slight cloves all blend together magically.  Thick and creamy mouthfeel.  Dan Carey of New Glarus, you are the rock god of wheat beers.

Creamy, dense texture: chewy bananas and cloves in a very fruit-forward hefe; while the wheat shows prominently in the nose, theres more chewy bananas and esters in the mouth, well-balanced by a light peppery yeast and dry cloves; just an excellent drinkability, this was finished way too quick (my wife didnt help matters).

Sunshine yellow with lots of carbonation and a snow white peak.  Very upfront clove aromas, with pleasant back ground of banana baby food (thats good).  The banana takes a bit of the lead in the flavor.  Really, it tastes a bit of the stuff I used to sneak bites of when feeding my children.  The carbonation is lively, yet not aggressive.

If RB rated to style, this man of odd-looking dance would reign king at 5.0. Aromas of hay, banana, cinnamon, alfalfa blended nicely with the various smells of the festival, both fair and foul. Hints of nutmeg and walnut blend with cane syrup and grass on the palate, aiding and abetting my experience with the swine nearby. An excellent beer to complement an always enjoyable state fair.

Ripe bananas, clove, lots a lovely yeast, and even hints of vanilla and vanilla pudding make up the aroma--I didnt pick up any cinnamon.  Flavor adds a bit of a lemon tang to cut the sweetness of all the aforementioned aromas.  I dont think this has any bitterness at all.  No idea this thing was as strong as it is.  Medium body with lots of carbonation.  I found this beer to be totally awesome, and Im glad I picked up a case.

10,"2007-08-12",3.6,"12 oz bottle
Ive had a couple of these now.  My conclusion is that while this is an awesome release I cant wait for the next one.  It is a perfectly made hefeweizen ... which means I cant get all that excited about it.  It is on par with the Piece Top Heavy Hefeweizen which I had later (but entered earlier).  If only it were possible to cellar this, I would drink it again next summer.
Aroma / Appearance - The hazy orange body danced lightly around the glass swirling into a yellow murk towards the base.  A bleached white head sat on top the entire time, wavering only a little towards the end.  Vanilla, wheat, whipping cream and a very strong fruit foundation make it accessible to almost anyone.
Flavor / Palate - Ripened bananas, wheat and a hint of butterscotch (not in a bad way) hit the senses the first.  The tastes do not really change over the course of this very sessionable beer.  It only took ten minutes to finish off and then I was ready for the next one.  Perhaps I just like my hefeweizens heavier on the fruit than most but that was the only major flaw I was able to find.  If this were an annnual relase I woul buy several sixers a year.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
10,"2007-08-11",3.2,"Pours cloudy gold with average head.  Aroma of wheat and spice with dark fruit.  Flavor matches aroma - a tad too much sweetness for me, but I could just be getting sick of the dark fruit theme... its been in virtually all their unplugged series and now seems to be creeping into their others... .","Golden, Wisconsin, USA","JohnnyOS"
10,"2007-08-10",4.0,"Pours a nice cloudy gold with a medium-sized white head.  There is plenty of lacing throughout.  Aroma is heavy with wheat and spice.  The taste is very robust for a wheat beer but not too over-the-top.  It finishes very crisp and is not as rich as other wheats.  Nicely balanced, and thus easier to drink a lot of it.  Cheers New Glarus!","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Petrucci914"
10,"2007-08-10",3.6,"Thanks to Skyview for sharing.  Hops and wheat on the nose with faint yeast.  Similar flavor.  Cloyingly sweet bubblegum finish.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
10,"2007-08-07",4.0,"Pours a nutty brown.  Aroma smells of rich wheat with hints of spice.  The palate was fuller for a wheat beer which makes it a little different than many American wheats.  Wonderful crisp and slightly bitter finish.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","awautlet"
10,"2007-08-07",4.2,"Bottle.  Pours to a really hazy graham cracker brown body with a tall, lasting, airy meringue white head.  Awesome head retention, lacing, and color.  The aroma is alive with crisp wheat, bubblegum clove yeasts, ripe bananas.  The best smelling German Hefeweizen Ive ever smelled.  Notes of graham crackers.  The flavor is wheaty graham crackers, ripe bananas, light bubblegum yeasts.  Very tasty.  The palate is medium bodied with a nice vibrant carbonation.  Light lingering quality of flavor, but finishes clean.  If there ever was a perfect beer in any style, this is it!","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
10,"2007-08-05",3.2,"I was very excited to try this wheat beer at the State Fair.  So excited that it was my first beer of the day!  Alas, my excitement waned as soon as the first drops touched my tongue.  Theres too damn much wheat in here, so much that, when combined with all of the cinnamon and malt it tastes like a piece of bread.  Maybe some people like that, but its not for me.  From the tap.","Appleton, Wisconsin, USA","prosqtor"
10,"2007-08-05",4.1,"Thank you Drewbeerme for this 12oz bottle.  Cloudy orange apperance with huge white long lasting head.  Strangely I can get the cinnamon in the nose as well as other spiciness and a small amount of sweet malt, also some alc.  Orange as well as other fruit in the flavor as well as wheat, banana, biscuit, very solid.  Full body and creamy.  As I said very solid.  I wish I had greater access to these beers.","Grand Rapids/Chicago, Michigan, USA","xnoxhatex"
10,"2007-08-04",3.2,"Not as good as the Solstice or Black but better than the Copper.  Kind of guessed the high ABV from the name and once I poured it the head seemed a bit forced as it was very effervescent, like a soda, not as creamy as other hefes.  Plus that seems to be a trend, kicking up the ABV in lighter beers, a trend I really dont like, especially for summer.

Pours a hazy stained oak color with the forementioned head.  Nice aroma of yeast, cloves, and bananas.  Taste is of fresh bread with a hint of spice.  There is a definite alcohol burn at the back of the throat which got more noticable  toward the end.

A disappointment for me in a style I usually like.","Ohio, USA","redlem"
10,"2007-08-01",3.8,"Thanks to monger for this gem. It pours a cloudy dark yellow with a frothy, meringue like white head. The aroma and flavor are of cloves and some banana with a crisp finish. Very tasty.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
10,"2007-08-01",4.0,"Picked up a single 12-oz bottle at Murrays Liquors in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin. Pours a cloudy golden pale brew with a creamy off white head that slowly dissolves to a fine film and good lacing. Aroma of tropical fruit, banana esters, light yeast and some flowery hops. Taste is semi-sweet, medium bodied with very light carbonation. Flavors picked up are multi-grain malt, some pineapple and something that reminds me of those candy sugar cigarettes I once tried, or was it Bazooka bubble gum? Finish is smooth and creamy, with some slight yeast and banana aftertaste flavor.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
10,"2007-07-30",3.9,"Good looking, appetizing aroma - sweet and spicy. Lots of ""tart"" wheat malt here, which balances the sharp spiciness. Lots of blunt sweet fruitiness (banana, peach). Not the thirst quencher I was expecting, but a unique and tasty beer.","DeForest, Wisconsin, USA","howie"
10,"2007-07-30",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2008 July 2007.  Very hazy and bright golden pour producing a very thick cream.  Clove and butter nose.  Banana esters and golden kiwi, mashed wildflower pulp.  More cloves on the tongue, with peach, pineapple, and bubblegum.  A weird, unpleasant waft of cigarrette smoke at the finish mars this a bit.  Kind of singes the nose with swallowing.  Acidic finish.  A mildly dry pear skin and cinnamon character.  Fresh and lively palate lets very little alcohol through.  Pristinely well made, as usual.  Thanks for sharing, Bob! 8/4/6/4/15 3.7
August 2008.Opaque sunny orange appearance.  Clove, butter, mint and perfectly ripe banana nose, with a cottony, white bread texture.  Lightly herbal, and greenish.  Smooth, and soft, and quiet.  Flavor throws sugary bits of golden and green kiwi on the typical ripe banana, soft clove and buttery yeast profile.  Lemon presence provides a sparkly tartness, but for the most part the flavors are thick and sweet.  A fluffy bubblegum flourish at mid-palate pulls it in the wrong direction, slightly.  Because the body is so full, the chunkiness of the ester and powdery fruit sugar sweetness gets to be somewhat cloying, especially as theres not enough of a dry bite at the finish for it to be called refreshing.  Its a mild dryness in the finish, something like cinnamon sugar and fruit skin.  Though nice, theres too much body, altogether, and not enough brisk. 7/4/7/3/14 3.5  


Same 2008 batch, again.  Reconsidering.  This is a really lush and balanced spicy-sweet example.  A calmish, blonde weizen bock of sorts that takes no prisoners in its assault of myriad spices and fruit.  When longing for something brisk and refreshing, Weihenstephaner is still the best, but when looking for something of depth and substance, and still with a little refreshing bite, this one couldnt better satisfy.  8/4/8/4/16 4.0","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
10,"2007-07-29",4.1,"Wow, 7.2%? Seriously? Very fruity, bready aroma, and a very nice, light palate. If I were prone to using the word ""lovely"", this would be the time. Flavors is also rather sweet, with a definate pineapple note combined with clove, cinnamon. Very enjoyable. Thanks to Buckybeer for the trade!","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
10,"2007-07-28",3.9,"12oz bottle. Poured a medium to deeper and cloudy golden color with a larger sized head. Aromas of spices (cloves and cinnamon as the description notes), bananas, wheat, and citrus. Tastes of spices (Im getting more cinnamon vs. cloves), bananas, wheat and citrus. Lightly tart finish. Never would have guessed this one was more than 7%.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"

8/26/08, 12oz bottle, thanks to holdenn for offering this up at his dinner party. oh and thanks for the great meal as well! okay this is a beautiful, extremely tasty, refreshing, and in perfect balance. awesome hefe, and easily the best American hefe if not best of all time.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
10,"2007-07-26",4.3,"Beautiful, hazed, golden and buffed bronze in color with a resplendent, thick, sudsy and whipped white head morphing tall on top. Aroma is a ticket straight into heaven. Marigolds, sweet orange cream, buttery cloves mixing with grounded clover, and caramel coated vanilla beans all settle onto nectar laden honey grahams. Flavor rides in with a flavorful, nearly lactic lemon buttercream character. Soft, fluffy cotton and clover intermingle in a gardenlike orange honey blossom tree. Sweet cream, spicy cloves and banana meringue grahams harmoniously fizzle and melt in the mouth. Milky lemon herbal sets dance around the tonsils. Rounded, balanced beauty. White pepper and cloves meet with a spicy ginger body to give an active upper dominion to the full palate family. Sugar capped cloves, spicy banana ginger and caramel custard cream treat with a nice sweet acidity in the milky finish. Absolutely lovely.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
10,"2007-07-26",3.9,"a good beer to be sure, but beyond a doubt the weakest of the last four wheat beers (Solstice, Black Wheat, Copper Kettle).  It doesnt look as good as the others.  no visible sediment, and more dark gold than orange like Solstice.  Still a good looking beer, tall white but thin and quickly fading head on top.  The aroma is full and vibrant.  It has sugar, banana, light citrus, and wheat.  Unfortunately the alcohol is noticeable in the aroma, and detracts slightly from the beer overall.  Flavor is very sweet, fine for a wheat beer.  Thick mouthfeel, but again to compare to solstice, not as sweet and full as that beer.  Wheat and sugar, fruit including banana, and again, just a hint of alcohol in the flavor.  This beer is definitely a success and quite good, but New Glarus has a made a better hefeweizen.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
10,"2007-07-25",4.1,"7/25/2007:  New Glarus Dancing Man Wheat pours beautifully into my wheat glass.  It is cloudy and golden orange in color.  There is a flurry of carbonation and a large, foamy off-white head that is retained pretty much from the initial pour to the last sip.  The aroma is banana, clove, wheat with a touch of caramel richness to it, and even a whisp of smoke!  The flavor is fruity with some bubblegum (kind of like a Belgian Ale) along with  some malty wheat, Hawaiian bread, banana, clove, and a lingering rich and spicy finish.  The alcohol is tucked away nicely, especially for being a 7.2% ABV HEFEWEIZEN!  This beer is more full than expected, but thats quite alright since the additional body works well with this beer.  Not only is is soft and mellow, but it also feels deceptively light and airy on the palate.  What a great combination of characteristics that results in a wonderful mouth feel.  This is a killer Hefeizen and the best of the New Glarus wheat beers so far.  I thought that the <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer/new-glarus-coppe Glarus Copper Kettle Weiss was a great beer, but this one is even better and is without a doubt my new favorite Hefe!

10,"2007-07-24",4.0,"Bottle. Pours a nice hazy golden color with a big frothy off white head. Aroma of cloves, yeast and citrus. The flavors of cloves, wheat and bananas are up front and mellow. Has a good clean crisp taste that makes you savor each sip. Has the complexity with out a lot of overkill in any specific area. This is another well made craft beer from New Glarus!.","Roscoe, Illinois, USA","JJClark"
10,"2007-07-23",4.1,"Pours a cloudy golden bronze with a spotty-lacing frothy white head.  Sweet, authentic wheaty banana and bready German yeasty aroma has a touch of peppery clove.  Body starts very full for a hefeweizen with a lot of sweet wheat, banana bubble gum, and doughy yeast toward a slightly drier, mildly warming clove finish.  Too full to be a session-style hefeweizen, but very tasty.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
10,"2007-07-23",4.3,"This rockets right to the top of my list of hefeweizens. From a 12-oz. bottle, it pours a very cloudy, almost opaque orangey-gold with sizable white head. The head stays with you until the not-very-bitter end. Great lacing. Bananas & cloves predominate in the moderate aroma. Big initial taste--surprisingly sweet with tangerines, cinnamon, banana & clove all making an appearance . Great wheat backbone. Minor bittering, with an almost orange peel-like taste in the followup. Superbly rich & creamy mouthfeel.  Best hefe Ive ever tasted.","Wisconsin, USA","NeonLX"
10,"2007-07-21",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2007 Top-notch HW. Fuller, stickier, more carbonated body then some of my other favorites in this style and a bit more spicy, including unusual cinnamon and mineral note in the finish.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","chimpscampee"
10,"2007-07-20",3.7,"New Glarus does so many things so well.  This is a genuine Hefe. Cloudy gold in color.  Clove aroma was very appealing.   No gimmicks in the taste - jut a good hefe-weizen.

10,"2007-07-20",4.1,"Man when Dan decides to perfect something he goes all out.  This one is hazy pale orange-yellow.   Full spice aroma with yeasty banana/little clove but tons of flavor.  Great in the mouth, like a banana cream pie. A big beer for a wheat.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","jewedekind"
10,"2007-07-17",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 7, 2008 Pours a golden cloudy color with thick bubbly head that fades quickly.  Aroma is of clove, banana, slight cinnamon, and I swear that I smelled a touch of smoke.  Taste is surprisingly the same but with more of an emphasis on an unripe banana and some light citrus flavors.     This is a bit different then other hefeweizens.  It’s very similar to the Imperial Weizen New Glarus put out, without the hop character.  While last year I wasn’t impressed with this one, the condemnation I got from my brother is well deserved.  Because this year, this stuff freaking rocks.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"

Realy good!","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","KingpinIPA"
10,"2007-07-14",3.9,"Bottled.  Poured a rich, hazy sun-burnt orange with a towering cap of creamy white head.  The aroma was quite prolific with toasted bananas, cloves, cinnamon, and doughy maltness.. somewhat sweet, and very well executed.  The flavor had toasted bananas again at the core along with honey-tinted caramel sweetness.. prickly wheat danced toward the outer reaches of the tongue, paired with pepper, clove, and cinnamon spiciness.. finish was long and a touch tacky, carrying banana, spices, and a hint of bubblegum.  Medium-bodied and a touch thick on the palate for a hefe.. medium sourness from the wheat and a hint of lemon.. Well Done!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Aromas of sweet wheat, cloves, light banana, yeasty dough. LIght sweet fruit and wheat in the flavors. Some pale malt and hints of alcohol, which is quite well hidden for a 7.2% hefe (this likely should be considered  a weizenbock). A few of these and you will be dancing, or sleeping. Most drinkable, without too many esters, a problem I find with many a stronger weissbier. Once again, thanks New Glarus Brewery for making quality beer after beer.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
10,"2007-07-10",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2008 12 oz bottle from Discount Liquor.  Pours a hazed yellow with a white head.  Great balance in the nose of wheat, caramel, dough, lemon, banana, and fruit.  Creamy palate and flavors that match the aroma.  The balance of flavors leaves nothing standing out but it all working together extremely well.  So balanced and so drinkable, its hard to say what it is that makes this stand out, other than the incredible balance and drinkability.  I think this will now be a regular sixer I pick up when crossing the northern border.    7/4/7/4/16 = 3.8

12 oz bottle sampled thanks to drewbeerme around the campfire.  Pours a cloudy yellow with a white head.  Nose of clove, yeast, bready malt, bannana with a light sweetness.  Creamy body, sweet malts, doughy yeast, wheat, banana, a touch of spice, a little sweet.  But a good hefeweizen.  I dont know if I got the yeast out of the bottom of the bottle.

10,"2007-07-07",4.1,"Thank You Thank You Dan Carey for following your bliss in making Bavarian style Hefeweisse !   This is exceptional and worth pour after pour !   This will be a winner and hopefully lure people away form the ""psuedo wheat beers"" that mass marketing has pulled starting beer fanatics in with...  The crack of the cap gives and audible note of good carbonation typical of a good hefeweizen.  The aroma is malt/bread with hints of clove/lemon and spicy wheat aroma.  The first sip and one slips into a time warp where you find yourself in a Bavarian beer garten smiling over the thought of whats in your glass.  It is effervescent, malt and flavorful.  Light straw color with the traditional yeast cloudiness and moussy head.  The finish is bready/sweet and with a nice bite of carbonation.  I am going to have to preach on this beer and recommend you go and purchase a sixer or two of this wonderful beverage.  Man can only hope that this is reviewed by New Glarus and made a yearly beer and not simply a seasonal.  Thank you New Glarus for raising the bar once again.
