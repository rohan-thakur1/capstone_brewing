A hint of mineral and very light white grape, with more wildflower and tangerine. Bizarre and awesome, with biscuity and crackery malts sparsely providing balance in the nose and no alcohol or flaw noted.Stronger tropical fruits in the mouth, with lots of peach/nectarine and tangerine-guava. Bitterness is crisp and assertive, but doesnt build up/fatigue. Light white grape, lots of biscuit and mineral and light lemon, spice and tangerine lingering.

4047,"2016-09-05",3.2,"On tap @ Hill Farmstead. Cloudy golden beer with a white head. This beer is super dank and funky. A whole lot of green onion, garlic, and pine. There is a lot of grapefruit and lemon rind to it as well, though. Its got a touch of bready malt in there as well. The beer is rather intensely bitter and has a fair amount of that sulfur/onion/garlic thing going on. Oily citrus peel is dominant as well. It was by far my least favorite of the beers I tried on my visit.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
4047,"2016-08-30",3.8,"Fresh growler from HF. Good, light pale ale that takes the standard Hill pale ale profile -- light, slightly hazy, medium-bodied -- and then allows the Riwaka hops to take center stage.

Best I can describe it is peppercorns, light tropical fruits, orange, and grapefruit. Tastes much softer up front. Light citrus. A little grapefruit. Light grainy malt and doughy sweetness. Has just a bit of the peppercorn bite, but no real bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Could use just a little more bitterness, but its a fascinating hop.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

Pours a cloudy light golden amber color with a generous white head, great retention and lacing.  Aroma and flavor took me by surprise as I wasnt expecting something quite so unique while being exactly what expected.  Loads of tropical and juicy citrus hops, but there was a slight tropical leafiness as well that added a slight spice and earthiness that enhanced the juicy and sweet flavor (without distracting).  One of my favorite HF I/A PAs.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","yourefragile"
4047,"2013-01-23",4.3,"In short: A blond IPA with a fresh vibrant countryside flowers and fruity character
How: Growlers + tap at brewpub.  First time a fresh growler time a fresh growler shared the day of purchase by and with mcberko. Then tap at brewery, then another growler home.
The look: Cloudy blond body topped by a medium head leaving lots of lacings on the glass
In long: Nose is bursting with floral hops with a countryside flowers character over some fruits, like walking in a blooming countryside field carrying a basket a peaches.  Taste has the typical HP IPA fresh bready/crackery malt backbone, not too crisp, not too chewy, low sweetness sensation, voluptuous pillowy mouthfeel, generous yet very gentle carbonation..  Hopping is more aromatic than bitterness, countryside flowers, tropical fruits, a good amount of dry grass and a light spiciness sensation.  Full of hop flavors but with a smooth bitterness of low-medium intensity.  Another hoppy home run from Hill Farmstead.  Since the opening of Hill Farmstead I drink more beer than ever, and I think the medias exaggerate the danger of alcohol consumption, every year a lot more people die by drowning in water than by excessive ingurgitation of alcohol.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Hop forward in the mouth, with floral notes blending with elements of yuzu, white grapefruit, cut grass, and a touch of pale malt. Dry on the palate, with a clean bitter finish.

4047,"2012-10-12",3.9,"Growler de 750 ml, merci beaucoup à David. Arômes invitants dagrumes, de fleurs et dépices. Robe blonde et plutôt trouble, effervescence assez faible et légère dentelle. En bouche, le corps svelte laisse la place à un houblonnage particulièrement complexe considérant quil sagit dune bière mono-houblon. On retrouve dabondants agrumes et une belle touche florale et épicée. Le conditionnement nest pas aussi réussi que pour plusieurs bières de Hill Farmstead, mais le growler est probablement à blâmer. Finale moyennement amère et sèche. Une très belle pale ale/IPA.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MJGG"
4047,"2012-10-11",4.4,"My Bottom Line:
Three-dimensional citrusy spiciness reigns within this pillowy New World Pale Ale, leading to herbal hop resins, subtle straw and much merriment.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A fluffy head of foam floats atop the cloudy blond, leaving plenty of lacing.
-Drinkability is sky high due to the leanness of the body, the comfortable natural carbonation and the moderate bitterness.
-The aroma is simply superb. Amazing dry-hopping job as always from Hill Farmstead.
-This is the kind of hop that doesnt need blending to achieve complexity. A marvelous discovery for me.
-This smells so good I feel like leaving a couple of drops at the bottom of the glass and sniffing it all day.

4047,"2012-10-09",4.0,"750ml growler from brewery. Growler 3 days old. Sample on tap as well.
Appearance : Hazy pale yellow with medium foamy (after a hard pour) and creamy head. Extensive lacing.

Aroma : Floral but also a bit peppery and spicy. Some notes of mangos with some malt as well. 

Taste : Floral hops with light spicy notes. Finish slightly resinous and quite floral leading so a slightly peppery finish with resinous (and slightly grassy) notes. Passion fruits as well. Bitterness is quite moderate. 

Palate : Soft carbonation but it lost some compared to the tap sample I had at the brewery. Still enough carbonation to be enjoyable.

Overall : Quite malty, especially on the nose... more malt (I think) than what Im used to with HFB APAs. Not such a bad thing... just different. A bit less powerful than the Simcoe single hop APA I had yesterday night. Almost as complex but more subdued. Highly drinkable, almost quaffable. As with almost all HFB beers, this is an awesome beer.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"
4047,"2012-10-08",3.4,"Blonde, fizzy appearance; strong, herbal lemongrass, ginger and citrus rind nose.  Charmingly forward and unusual.

Basic herbal hop flavor, clean and composed but too quiet.  Lemony rind and water cracker.  The malt is so hidden and the hop seems to be a relatively low-laying one itself, though its flavor is lovely.

Crisp, ultra light palate.  Zesty finish with some snappy spice and quickly vanishing bitterness.  So quiet.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
4047,"2012-10-08",4.3,"Sampled multiple times draught and growler in the last 2 weeks. Pours a hazy bosc yellowish orange color with thin white heading. Smell is more hop-fruit dominate with notes of orange, sweet grapefruit, mango and herbal tea. Thin to medium mouth feel with nice carbonation and a lasting finish. Taste is right with the nose in hops and lingers on the palate nicely. Not harsh in any fashion, but nice bold unique hop flavor from the NZ Riwaka hops.

Nose is killer hill farm stylie--super citrusy, light grassy and herbal character.  Malt takes a back seat as always but its there and doing its job well, which is to balance the bitterness of the hops while still allowing them to run the show.  Pretty much of all of Shauns pale ales accomplish this every time.  Found the flavor on this bad boy to be a little less vibrant than the nose and highlighting more flowery, herbal hop profiles.  Palate is spot on. Interesting hop for sure.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
4047,"2012-09-28",4.5,"Very excited about this one. The beer is similar in appearance to most other HF IPAs. Orange with a white head. The aroma is fabulous, with a huge hop presence. Light in body, with a nice bouquet of citrus. A tad sweet, but not too. So drinkable. Fluffy and soft on the palate. Elegant bitterness in the finish. Overall, this was simply terrific.

4047,"2012-09-25",3.6,"On tap at Claires - Hardwick, VT. Fragrant and peppery aroma. I think this is my first exposure to an all-Riwaka Pale Ale. Its an interesting variety and perhaps not my favorite, nor the best for a single-hop beer. Riwaka seems to give off a strong peppery flavor, somewhere in between white peppercorns and Anaheim chilis. It never gets as rough as green bell pepper, but theres a certain and piquant green chili note throughout. The construction is, of course, fantastic and probably gives the best ability to taste this varietal in its most pure form, it just happens to maybe not be my favorite.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

S - Loving the nose on this. Reminds me of Galaxy (also an NZ hop). Has a sort of orange peel scent and some effervescent floral honey characters.

T - Even more delicious but sort of earthy muted citrus taste. More lemon and orange skins and pulp. It has this sort of cough syrup finish. Nice balance between bitterness and malts.

M - Medium body. Nice balance of carbonation
