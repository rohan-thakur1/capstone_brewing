2096,"2016-08-26",4.0,"Un-Muzzling Olde Muzzlehatch Ratings, #24. Cask pint at Cest What in Toronto, July 2008. Near-transparent gold with a small-to-medium, lasting bit of creamy head...powerful, very fresh citrus (grapefruit, maybe some blood orange) and resinous hoppy nose; rain in the forest...quite smooth, full, bitter throughout, lightly syrupy and sweet throughout, with a lovely drying crisp finish...just one of those beers, as I wrote and try to remember now, that puts it all together - no particularly spectacular or even special individual elements, simply a superbly constructed work, like a very good old Hollywood studio film, you might say, where the ""auteur"" doesnt really matter but the end result is endlessly watchable.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2096,"2014-03-13",2.8,"On cask at Bar Hop (Toronto). Clear amber with an off white head. Initial impression is of a nice mild, hint of hops and some caramel malt, but it then becomes somewhat flat, with too some sweetness and a touch of dry fruit. Just not my thing.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"
2096,"2013-05-22",3.1,"Cask to pint glass @ Volo
Aroma of vinegar and a slight pineyness but tbh, the vinegar is very strong. Slightly cloudy yellowish amber with a bubbly scattered white head. No vinegar taste, I almost think that it's the glass...taste is muted, grapefruit, cookie and hay. Sadly the overall score really takes a hit due to the aroma.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","dfearnley"
2096,"2012-06-14",3.3,"Finally found this one after confusing it with hop addict like 3 times. Super intriguing for the style. Aroma starts light but the beer follows through with a bitter boozy finish. Carbonation is soft on the tongue due to the cask pour. Even  has a hint of sourness in the end. This is great for the style but a little overrated in my opinion. Cask at barvolo.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
2096,"2011-12-30",3.3,"Pour is clear gold, fizzy white head. Light body. Aroma is bready with mild hol and malt. Not too inspiring. Flavour is quite grassy, hint of grapefruit. Quite clean.

I triued this beer on tap on February 10, 2011 at ""Cest What"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The beer poured a translucent medium gold colour with a white foamy head that sticks to the sides of the glass.  The aroma was mild floral hops, grains, and dishsoap.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation.  The flavour was citrusy hops, and grainy malt.","Milton, Ontario, CANADA","cyrenaica"
2096,"2010-10-10",3.6,"Cask at Cest What in Toronto, served in an English pint glass. Pours hazy golden with a small white head. The head fades quickly to a bare cover but leaves copious amounts of fine lace on the glass. On the nose, there are big aromas of citrus and biscuit, along with resin and flowers. The flavour starts out slightly sweet but soon acquires a moderate-heavy resinous hop bitterness that persists to the end. The finish is average in length, soft and hoppy. On the palate, it is medium in body with a smooth, creamy texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice cask IPA. It presents a beautiful aroma of fresh, resinous hops and flowers. The hops are a bit soft and subtle. 2010-10-08","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"
2096,"2010-10-02",3.7,"Cask at Oktoberfest.  Pours a slight amber yellow with a nice white head.  Aroma is piney hop and mild citrus.  Taste is a smooth hop bitterness that isnt overpowering.  Some piney hop flavours and slight citrus in the aftertaste.  Great beer.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","cfrancis"
2096,"2010-08-22",3.1,"A lightly hazed golden IPA with a very thin white head. In aroma, pleasant floral hops, with light berry notes and a bit of meaty notes.

After Denison set the bar high I did not know what to expect from this.  It took a while to narrow down the choices; settling for a cask IPA was a great decision however.  More mellow than your typical IPA it turned into a sessionable and fun beer before moving on to the next stop.

Aroma / Appearance - Cloudy orange with tame carbonation it was topped by a clear white head.  Orange and grapefruit are apparent but toned down and muted by a woody base.  Somewhere a hint of yeast sneaks in as well.

Flavor / Palate - Mellowed orange rinds remind me of an IPA that has gone stale (but without the other ill effects).  Easy on the tongue and throat it leaves a woody aftertaste like old pieces of sawdust.  I would love to try a normal tap to see how it is sans cask.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Flavor is minerally, floral hops, fresh cut grass, toasted malts, light breadiness, clean as hell- with a moderate bitter finish, and incredibly drinkable- very smooth.

Nose of fresh,leafy,  right of the vine hops....hops hops hops.........perfume, lemon and grapefruit with a bit of bread crust and earthy malts. I like the fresh hop aroma. I wasn’t as sold on the flavour, but it was still good. Again, the fresh hops are the main star.....grapefruit pith and citrus flavours...leafy greens lead to mango and then lead to a bit of bready malty sweetness. Fucking creamy as hell, I could drink this by the gallon. Very good.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"

2096,"2008-08-10",2.9,"Objectively speaking:
A less bright and darker IPA example than the hop addict though I did not try this one from the hand-pull.

I like:
Confidently straightforward. Simple, but assumingly so. Citrus oriented IPA of obvious American lineage.  Light-bodied and easy to drink.

I dislike:
Does not have the pleasant freshness of its hop addict peer. Headless. Rather murky appearance. Rather astringent hop bite. Dull malt base.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2096,"2008-06-08",3.5,"Tap at the Victory Cafe, Toronto.
As soon as I saw the name I knew I had to try it! Cloudy orange colour with nice of white head. Aroma was a wildly hoppy smell (at least to Canadian standards) It was like having an American hopped out beer in Canada. The malt and flowery sweetness blended well. The flavour carries the aroma equally as well. The body was medium but I thought it could be a bit thicker.","Brantford, Ontario, CANADA","Cartoonkhaki"

2096,"2008-05-02",4.0,"Cask.  At Volo.  Have had this many times, from its early incarnation to its current thick, acidic cask lovliness.  Pours murky orange with a wispy head - Im sorry, but these days every time I see it I get wood - its a 5.  The aroma - very simple, very much an acidic hop-forward UK-style IPA on double steroids - bitter resin and mild conifer, slightly sweet in the background, but this is all about acidic/astringent hop goodness - not sure my American friends would love it, its not a west coast clone at all.  The taste starts gently bitter, quite herbal actually, and the malt is at its most noticeable - but the acidic funky bitterness that so appealed to the nose starts to build - it never reaches DIPA territory, or even seems ultra aggressive, but after that first swallow youre not allowed to forget its a damned fine cask IPA and dont even THINK about not ordering another.  This is actually light-bodied, while still seeming thick - it lingers for a decent patch, but eases off your palate well in time for the next sip - while too strong to appel it ""session,"" you could (I have) drink several of these in an hour or two.  Good stuff!","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

Clear, deep blonde body is topped by a generous fine bubbled and lasting white head that coats the glass.  Pale malt sweetness up front is joined by a pronounced but balanced bitterness that keeps it from becoming cloying.  Plenty of grapefruit hops and lingering fruity esters.

2096,"2007-08-31",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2007 From Cask at the Castle:

Pulled a pale clouded yellow into my pint glass. Rocky sticky cap had fair retention.

Decent aroma to the cask version, The Cascades and fuggles variety hops combine with the yeast esters to produce a musty-peach or earthy citrus discernment.

Thin bodied, light malt spine mild, character.

The frontside is well balanced with mild malts and citrusy hops then the fuggles take over in the thin mid palate and bitter up the finish....mild and drikable.

Nice dose of cascade flavor but this beer is too pale and thin of malts, ABV  and mild to be called an IPA...possibly a great west coast style version of a mild pale but not an IPA. A nice session mild but consider me underwhelmed if this is an IPA.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

2096,"2007-04-14",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 23, 2008 Cask at the Victory Cafe (updated on Sept. 22/08 from cask at C’est What)- I’ve always liked every Durham beer that I’ve tried, and I am an admitted hop head, so I was more than excited to try this brand new cask offering.  Came a hazy sunset gold with a beautiful thick white head.  Aroma hugely hoppy and fruity.  Grapefruit, field strawberry, pine and a light earthiness as well.  Flavours beautifully balanced - hop fruitiness, earthiness and English malt all mingle expertly.  Delicate cask carbonation makes for a soft and silky mouthfeel.  Good refreshing bitterness in the mid-palate continues into the lingering finish.  One of the few Ontario beers that comes close to resembling an excellent west-coast IPA, but it’s uniquely Canadian at the same time.  Would be a beautiful summertime ale.  I REALLY hope that Durham is planning to make this a regular beer in their lineup - it’s the best of their beers I’ve had.  I want more.  GREAT stuff.","Parkdale, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","VeloVampire"
