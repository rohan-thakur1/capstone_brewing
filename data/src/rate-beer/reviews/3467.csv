3467,"2016-11-26",4.7,"Fles 2013 Hell Demon verkregen via een trade, voor een Cantillon Saint Lamvinus, met dank aan Thijs! Gedeeld en uitgeschonken in To Øl Teku en Uiltje tasting glazen. Gitzwart van kleur olieachtig, met een geweldige hoge lichtbruine schuimkraag, met fijne bubbels erin, ook lang stabiel in het glas. Bij het openen van de fles komt het geweldige aroma je al tegemoet. Zoete chocolade, kersen, koffie, rozijnen/krenten, toffee. De hopaccenten zijn krachtig, maar zo mooi in balans, aroma kan niet beter voor een niet BA Imperial Stout. Het smaakpallet is heel zoet, maar ook vol romig, met uitgebalanceerde hop notities. Met tonen van geroosterde mout, koffie, chocolade, kersen, blauwe bessen. Daarna een overgang naar donker gedroogd fruit als rozijnen, krenten, vijgen en dadels, een mooie diepe complexiteit in zowel aroma als smaak. De afdronk is meer bitter, pure chocolade en hopaccenten. De carbonatie is medium tot zacht, met een olieachtig, zacht crème mondgevoel en textuur, de alcohol van bij 10% is gevaarlijk goed verborgen. Eindconclusie: een fantastische Imperial Stout deze Surly Darkness, een van de betere die ik op heb. Wel heel erg zoet, ik kan me voorstellen dat niet iedereen dat kan waarderen. Maar persoonlijk vind ik de balans tussen zoetheid en de complexe smaaklagen, zeer goed en interessant. Speciale vermelding voor het gave artwork op de fles en de rode was. Nogmaals dank aan Thijs voor het regelen van deze fles. Het zou ook interssant zijn om smaakverschillen in de nieuwere of de BA batches te kunnen proeven, als ik nog ooit dit bier nog kan verkrijgen.

Nose has tidal waves of dark malts ... fairly abundant hops that mesh well with dark chocolate and French Roast.. Honestly, no complaints.

The bitterness from the hops is apparent and combines with some drying dark malts and moves into nice RIS characteristics.. fudgey brownies.. grassy and mild citrus hops are pretty much there throughout the flavor.. coffee remnants that have a bit of dark malt bite... dry finish has some citrus hops and drying cocoa and bits of coffee....

Body is pretty dialed in.. carbonation seems maybe a bit high.. but it may be too warm at this point..

It pours an opaque caramel brown, topped by a dense brown, soft foam head that has light retention and sparse and dense - although a bit runny - even, sheet lace. The taste is highly sweet with a medium high bitter that strengthens late. The texture is just short of chewy, made smooth by a soft, fizz carbonation. The full body is flavored with a cherry, raisin, chocolate, and light smoke and leather character. The finish has a smokiness and a clean pin zip; first flavored y a sweet raisin and cola flourish with a smokey background and is subtly replaced by a stong, dry pine and dark coffee with bitter licorice after a brief time.

Both poured in surly tulip shaped glasses purchased from the brewery. One taster did not know which was which. 2014 cellared in our basement cellar with temps that range between 50-65 degrees seasonally throughout the year. 

Visual:
Both inky black in color. Thin lacy head on the 2014. The 2015 had better head retention - medium with fair amount of lacing. Both were a creamy tan color. 

Smell:
2014 lots of dark fruits, cherry, raisin, dark chocolate overlay. Toffee and caramel. 
2015 malty, coffee notes. Bourbon vanilla

Taste/mouthfeel:
2014 starts how it smells with the chocolate covered cherries. Develops in the mouth and more of a mocha. Booziness and coffee notes come out more as the beer warms. Lingering (long) mocha, chocolate finish. Big body and chewy mouthfeel. 
2015: caramel and vanilla hit the palate first. Roasted malts, a slightly bitter dark chocolate hit next. Body is more medium. Does not have the booziness feel like the 2014 (is that from cellaring? Will compare next year). Medium to long finish with the vanilla coffee notes. 

Overall:
2014 is a fantastic example of a big bold boozy Russian imperial stout. Hard to find any fault in it. 4.75/5. 
2015 is a good beer in its own right but next to the 2014 falls slightly short. Palate significantly different without the fruity flavors. Dont know how much added complexity is due to a year in the cellar, but for drinking now about 4.25/5

We have a 2015 bourbon barrel aged darkness too that we have not yet opened. Excited to see what notes the bourbon barrel adds to the beer.","","Kbierle"

3467,"2015-12-13",4.8,"AROMA Expensive old fashioned sweets. Caramel, vanilla, toffee, butterscotch, chocolate fudge. Smells very sweet.

APPEARANCE Slightly spotty head with a nice caramel color and a thin head that burns away fast and just clings to the glass in a nice silky ribbon.

TASTE Malty, chocolatey, a little roasty with a touch of bitterness. The alcohol burn arrives fashionably late just as the last roasty notes are fading. Great balance among all the different flavor elements. Not actually as sweet as it smells.

PALATE Full bodied, thick and creamy, just enough carbonation to keep it from being heavy or syrupy. Nice long finish with a slow evolution of flavors that invites contemplation.

OVERALL One of the most expensive beers Ive ever bought. Fantastic even at $20/bottle. Lots of flavor complexity that changes and evolves as you work your way through the bottle. A nice long finish. Not as roasty or bitter as the name implies, or as sweet as the smell test suggests. Easy and pleasurable to drink. Pairs as well with beef jerky as it does with champignon brie. Hats off to Surlys brewmasters. Youve got a real winner here.","Des Moines, Iowa, USA","saltyseadog"

Pours a motor oil black color, with a dark brown, stable head, with lots of bubbles in it. Leaves back a viscous film after swirling, revealing the beers thickness. It is actually that viscous, that it leaves spots of lacing on the glass after taking a sip.

Offers sweet aromas of molasses, toffee and caramel on top. This gets balanced by coffeeish earth, charred coal, dried fruits and warming chocolate dipped alcohol. This gets hold together by even more charred malts and toasty bakers chocolate.

Offers the most silk mouthfeel. Incredibly smooth, soft on the palate, with a diverse, fuller body. Low carbonated, with rich roasty flavors to it. 

Tastes of dark, roasty malts, accompanied by sweet toffee and smooth chocolate. Turns then sweeter, due to caramel and molasses, with a good amount of roast shining through. Provides boozy, earthy coffee, wrapped up by sweet liquor pralines, resulting in a very sweet finish, driven by milk chocolate and smooth cream.

Has a very sweet but gently balanced appearance, preventing the beer from becoming cloyingly sweet. As for its depth, roasted coffee adds a lot of character to the beer, competing with smooth chocolate and sweet fudge.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3467,"2014-10-02",4.3,"""im going to rate this one by comparison, mainly because it so closely resembles a few other elite (but far cheaper) hoppy russian imperial stouts. storm king is thinner, but has a similar flavor profile and aroma. yeti is hoppier, but otherwise very similar...maybe a touch roastier too. but this one was almost identical to goose island night stalker. if i had this in a night stalker bottle, i wouldnt have guessed anything was amiss. the only difference? night stalker, yeti (12) and storm king (12) combined cost $15 or so. Darkness was way more. Elite impy with a huge roasted malt body and a slap of hops in the aroma and flavor, with a hint of coffee and molasses. Very good, but definitely a one timer for me...i can get too many awesome beers for that price! ok - i lied. had it again thanks to Travis. 2011 edition as oppsed to the 2010. not as hoppy...sweeter with some fig and dark fruitiness going on.

3467,"2014-06-26",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 28, 2014 [Tap @ Surly / 2014] So the 2014 bottles were High West Rye Whiskey Barrel Aged, but I was lucky enough to try the non-bottled, non barrel aged version at Darkness Day 2014. On tap none the less. My god. What an incredible beer. Huge brown sugar, sticky sweet bakers chocolate, mild ashy char, molasses, rich prunes, burnt toffee coated black cherries... Hops are evident at first, a little pine resin bitterness, but as the beer warms, it gets sweeter, more decadent, & very rich, but never overbearing. Gotta bump this up a point, this was fantastic. Perhaps the atmosphere helped, too, but this Darkness was pure bliss. I enjoyed this even over the barrel aged version (side by side).
[Bottle / 2012] Approximately one year old. Thanks to Kevin. Midnight black color, extremely deep ruby & brown at the edges. Fine bubbled, deep mocha foam, creamy & layered nicely on top. Super sweet aroma of dark currants, black licorice, caramelized brown sugar, bittersweet chocolates, a touch of vanilla, just a small hint of char, ash, & roasted coffee bean. Taste is also very sweet but controlled well. Nice balance of leafy hops & roasted char to counter the sweet notes of bakers chocolate, cream, brown sugar, plums, star anise, & syrupy molasses. Currants, dates, chocolate, brown sugar, & a hint of coffee bean & roast lingers long into the sticky, coating finish. A delicious beer.
[Bottle / 2011] Thanks, Mike. About two years old. The hops have edged off a little bit, making this version a little more sweet. But still very palatable & not over-the-top compared to many other stouts of this type. Heavier sugary burnt caramel notes with lots of bittersweet cocoa & roast in the finish.
[Bottle / 2009] Thanks, Ed. Getting close to five years old. Huge presence of brown sugar coated dates with a river of sweet bakers chocolate underneath. Most prominent coffee bean flavor in the lingering finish. No sign of oxidation for this one, even at five years old. Possibly my favorite bottle yet.
[Bottle / 2008] Thanks, Ed. Almost six years old. This bottle probably had the most commanding dark fruity presence of all the Darkness Ive had. Lots of dates, prunes, currants, coated in brown sugar, molasses, & burnt caramel. Still a very robust underbody of creamy-sweet milky chocolate. Slight oxidation present in the aroma & flavor... A little papery staleness; not completely distracting, but I wouldnt let this one go for too much longer.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

I poured this into a tulip.
The appearance is pitch black and it pours that way as well. It starts off with a one finger white to off white foamy head and gently dies at a nice pace leaving a nice coating of lacing that eventually spider webs and clings nicely to the sides of the glass.
The smell takes a superior amount of sweet sticky roasted chocolates and adds a decent underscore of vanilla to it. It all combines nice and roasty.
The taste is extremely sweet and sticky chocolate coating my taste buds. There is an extremely sweet sticky chocolatey aftertaste that ends up leaving a sweet sticky chocolatey finish as well.
On the palate, it sits about a medium to heavy with no booze noticed as I thought I was going to but no side effects are noticed. The carbonation is extremely smooth around my mouth and tongue. This one is a sipper, no gulping allowed or at least in my opinion, I say dont gulp.

First sip reaction - that's incredible. Appearance is pitch black, oil like consistency, large frothy dark tan head that laces to the glass. Aroma is rich in coffee, toffee, raisins, and light almost citrusy hops. Taste has a fantastic chocolate profile, not syrupy, but that consistency which may be an attribute of the fruity characteristics. The cherry / raisin / plum aspects are incredible. It's very smooth as well which is surprising....other RIS brews are fantastic but more of 'sippers', where I could see myself having more than one of these. Very happy that I had this one, definitely one of the best for the style which is probably why it's so sought after. I don't know if it gets a perfect 5 though, and I don't know why.

Black. Small, chunky brown head, lasting with lace. Complex roasty and interesting. Touch of dark fruitiness, dark cherry, little raisin, caramel, chocolate, dark chocolate All sorts of excellent roasty character. Pronounced but balanced sweetness. Dense but Smoooooth. Low bitterness. Hops have diminished. Full body. Sludgy in a good way. Thick, slick, soft, sticky. Subtle alcohol warmth in the finish. A great example of a gracefully aged beer.

3467,"2013-03-31",4.2,"2012 version.  I nearly cut my finger off trying to get that red plastic off of the top of the bottle. That wouldnt have been a good way to start. Once I finally got the top popped, the beer klugged out of the opening like motor oil. Its nearly black as coal and just as opaque. Except for the bottom edge of the glass, which when enough light does pass through, glints of cola brown are noted. The Irish coffee (not the cocktail--actual coffee in Ireland) foam-colored head is a stubborn, sticky, foamy one that certainly contributes to the sexiness of the beer. The nose is nice, but, surprisingly, not strong. Chocolate liqueur, lactose, mild smoky notes, and ripe banana are all present. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect. Creamy, smooth, viscous, and delightful. It never really dries up either, not even on the finish. I love the flavor of this one! Milk chocolate out of the gate. Alcohol shows up about midway and keeps things warm even after the finish. But the alcohol doesnt take away from the beer. If anything it helps temper the sweetness. This is reminiscent of the chocolate bourbon balls my Grandma used to make around Christmas time, only quite a bit less boozy. My Grandma could get a little carried away on the bourbon in her recipe. Dark ripe fruit, somewhere between a sweet cheery and a date, emerges late. It amazes me that more aroma doesnt blast out of this thing given the big flavor. This is a really nice Imperial Stout.

The aroma is quite disappointing. I may have made a mistake and opened this too soon but who knows. Some raisins but mostly just a cheap beer smell. As the head dissipates it leaves a lacing down the glass. The beer has a slight metallic tinge to it at the start but on the back end of the taste you definitely taste the coffee and toffee notes. The mouth feel is quite smooth and coats the entire mouth. Id say maybe slightly over-hyped but still a good RIS. 

Edit: after some time in the glass the harsh aromas disappeared. Aroma of raisins, some chocolate, and alcohol. Metallic taste went away as well. much improved.

Poured a black color with 2-3 fingers of thick, frothy, khaki tan head. Healthy layer of the khaki tan lacing on the side all the way down. Good retention on the top, some parts heavy and bubbly, others a bit thinner.

Smelled a big whiff of alcohol first. Once the dust cleared, I got dark cherry, plum, dark red wine (sherry?), raisin, toffee, caramel and chocolate. Surprisingly just a back whiff of coffee or coffee beans. Not too strong. 

Tasted better and stronger than the smell. Also unlike the smell, the alcohol was hidden. I got toffee, dark cherry and chocolate, mostly, but so smooth. Also sherry (I think), blackberries, caramel and light coffee notes. Very, very good.

Medium body (surprisingly). Sticky-to-slick texture. Average-to-soft (below average) carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish.

Taste is sweet, bitter and hoppy with roasted malts, high quality bitter chocolate, grapefruit juice, pine needles, dark roast coffee, orange peal, charred wood, figs, prunes, raisins, resinous wood, grass, caramel, toffee and dark grape syrup. Mouthfeel is round, hoppy dry, tiny astringent, tiny boozy and full bodied.

The taste is sweet enough that I cant detect any traces of ascorbic acidity or harsh bitterness from the roasted malt. On the other hand its not so sweet as to make it cloying and undrinkable.

CharmCityCrab edition:
Surly Darkness is one of my favorite beers, it always reminds me of Darkness Eve, which is like Halloween, Christmas and my birthday all combined. Maybe not all combined, but I do love it. The pour is dark like Darkness Eve (its at night), with a little head. The aroma is chocolate, roasted malts, toffee, its an imperial stout--you know what youre about to drink. The taste is all the stuff in the aroma and has some hops added with maybe a little bit of coffee as well. I can only drink so much Darkness which is good because it is hard to get and expensive. Its a seasonal so youre always really excited but if it was available all the time you would feel differently. This is good with cheese. The only negative is the cost which is way too high. Its so expensive I could never justify drinking it while walking the dog but drinking it on a cold winter night is perfect.","Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","TheHOFF43"

Big thanks to Masterski for getting me this rarity.

Poured from a bomber and split with my wife.

Appearance: Pours a thick body, kind of almost plops in with a thin ting that grows thicker as the pour intensifies.

Smell: Alcohol soaked nuts, raisins and figs. Whiffs of cocoa and chunks of chocolate but much more on the sugary, dark fruits side.

Taste: Raisins, figs, nougat, discreet chocolate and a tinge of black licorice. A bit of coffee as it warms but this resembles a barleywine almost. Not exactly what im looking for flavor-wise.

Mouthfeel: Boozy a bit, slight;y bitter and you eventually get in a groove but this doesnt feel like the strong RIS im looking for.

Overall: Have to say im a bit disappointed by this one. Compared to DL, this one is not as good. Flavors were good but for me, not worth the hype IMO. Ill take a DL instead.","Carignan, Quebec, CANADA","papat444"
3467,"2012-09-10",4.4,"2008 Vintage courtesy of the Happy Gnome hiding a keg in their vault! Commemorating their GMs final day of employment I rushed down to try this gem to see if it stood the test of time.

Aroma: Overwhelming dark fruits (figs, dates, and brandy soaked raisins). Fair amount of chocolate and coffee like aromas but highly subdued. Decent hop bitterness in the end of the nose, more than I thought for a four year old beer.

Appearance: Poured thick as motor oil, no dissipation of body over time here. 1/8-1/4"" caramel beige head, still a great deal of alcoholic legs present.

Taste: This one is a bit shocking, to me, its got a great deal of hop bitterness persisting through the brandy soaked raisin dark fruit flavors. Copious amount of chocolate in the foretaste with subdued hints of caramel, coffee, and even smoke in the aftertaste. Ive read reviews saying older vintages of Darkness are more like Belgian Quads and I can understand, but no, its just a nice sweet RIS. 

Palate/Mouthfeel: Thick and oily, leaves a coating of the complex flavors behind. Whoofta.Not as overwhelmingly intense as DL or Black Tuesday, but more pleasant.

Overall: To say I was let down is incorrect. Ive had so many different barrel aged stouts over the past year that going back to your daily driver Russian Imperial Stout may be difficult for some, but this is truly world class. 2008 is drinking nicely right now and for those of you hoarders with 3-4 left, share the wealth, this is not a $200 on Craigslist or eBay.

O - This is the best RIS and certainly the best non barrel aged stout I have tried. Thats probably due to my love of quads and dark fruits which this stout has on full display. For me there has always been three icons of the big waxed stout world. Abyss, Darklord, and Darkness. The Abyss is roasty and tobaco rich, Darklord is an overtly sweet vanilla bomb, and Darkness is strong on the dark fruits. This is just about perfect for me.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Poured into a snifter. Wow, this is dense. Glugs out of the bottle thick and slow. This is the blackest beer I have ever seen. Held up to the light, nothing is coming through, not even at the edges. Oh man, what is this going to do to my stomach? Big warm chocolatey scents burst out of this beer. Wow! Slight sour note on the finish. Little soy sauce. 

The body is my favorite part of this beer. I want to wrap myself up in this and go to sleep. This is the smoothest, creamiest beer. Carbonation is present, but it is overwhelmed by such a buttery creamy mouth. Man. The flavor reminds me of a melted chocolate bar in a drink. Seriously. This is pure chocolate. Mild tartness on the back end, but it is sweet and creamy. Bitterness is low. Slight smokiness in the aftertaste. Geez. This is good. Drinkability is very high as the alcohol makes itself a ghost in the flavor. Im feeling its presence a bit, but I cant detect it in the flavor. 

In all honesty, I didnt think I was going to like this beer. Even though it is so highly rated, I thought I would find it too much. It showed me a thing or two...","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

After trying the 10 and being disappointed I take a big swig of this. WOW completely different. Dark chocolate with a dark fruit tasted deep inside.  The hops bring this beer together. It adds a bitterness the only complements the chocolate and malts. Unique, but very tasty.","Ohio, USA","kmyers8807"
3467,"2012-04-21",4.5,"Vampiro version. Sometimes beers are so good theres little to say (but Im gonna try anyway). Scrape away all the hype and you have an amazing beer here. Just fantastically made and presented (in the wax bottle) its an amazing treat. BIG nose of cinnamon,vanilla,coffee, plums,prunes,figs,dates,sugar,molasses, chocolate, straight cocoa. Big dense pour. Flavours are really well integrated, just layers folding on top of each other. All the flavours on the nose are present in the mouth. Not rich and very drinkable for the style. This leads me to the only perceivable weakness I can see (and its not really a weakness) - it is a tad thin, compared to other beers in this style. But this lends to the drinkability and in that sense it reminds me of speedway stout. But this is a singular, original beast and better than I had hopped for. This is a beer that deserves all the hype - truly a beer geeks beer....really hope i can get another bottle of this!","JAPAN","jonno"

Tasted on 3/7/2012 from a silver waxed and capped 750mL bottle.  Pours a completely opaque, nearly black, dark brown with an average brown head that slowly recedes to average lace, leaving a thick layer of residue along the inside of the glass.  The nose is full of molasses, dark chocolate, coffee, milk chocolate syrup, raisin, generally darkly roasted malt, and just a touch of vanilla.  The flavor is fruity with molasses, date, raisin, and fig, with milk and dark chocolate, coffee, a ton of roast, and the same touch of vanilla from the nose.

3467,"2012-02-28",4.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/12/2010.  Served on tap in a 8 oz. stange at Hopleaf.

Darkness is what it says on the bottle, and darkness is what is inside. It pours a midnight black color with just a hint of slightly off-black molasses in the very tip of the glass. Darkness indeed. A creamy dark tan coffee head mellows in its creaminess, then recedes, reforming with every swirl and leaving some unexpected lace on the glass.

Dark roasted and chocolate malt are packed into the aroma, with espresso and vanilla providing support. Some unidentifiable spiciness is present, along with some pine hops.

Of course the taste starts out with a huge roasted and chocolate malt profile, which is very well put together. The bitterness up front seems to be due to the coffee and roasted malt, with the balance shifting between sweet and bitter. There are some dark fruit complexities in the middle - cherry, fig, and raisin. Of course Surly keeps it hopped up a little bit as well, adding even further complexity. But it still finishes a bit sweet, with a touch of alcohol to remind you it is a 10% ABV.

Very full body, obviously, with a nice creamy feel. Leaves my lips a bit sticky.

This is definitely a well-crafted stout and one I enjoy whenever I have the opportunity to have it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

It wasnt as thick and smooth as I would of hoped.  But more of the usual suspects that you would think a great RIS would have come out.  Nice bit of roastiness, dark fruits, toffee, and chocolate.

Pours a nice 1 finger milk chocolate head, body is pitch black. Head retention was good and lacing was very good. 

Smell is of rich chocolate cake batter, roasted coffee, charred oak, and slight alcohol. As soon as I opened bottle, aromas went directly in my nose. There is also some oxidation, prunes, but no hops.

Taste is charred oak, burnt chocolate malt, slightly bitter coffee, and chalky bakers chocolate. There is slight soy sauce/oxidation and prunes but chocolaty sweetness helps hide it. Hops really arent detected here. Alcohol is slightly present but for 10 percent, its very smooth

Mouthfeel is nice and rich, almost chewy. Carbonation is on the higher side but it helps to keep the body from becoming too syrupy. Small head of foam adds some nice texture to the beer.

Overall this beer was pretty good. Been waiting acouple years to try this beer and glad I finally got my hands on it.

3467,"2011-12-14",4.2,"Im from Northfield, a small city in Minnesota large enough to have four fast food restaurants but not so big that you see more than the one homeless person on the way. You can get a taxi here but theyre not out roving around where you can jump off the sidewalk and hail one. You have to call them on the phone, and theyre not yellow.
The weather varies explosively from day to day in this part of America, the jet stream undulating over us like an angry snake god. Ive seen a day when the temperature hit one hundred and eight degrees, another when it dipped twenty-eight degrees below zero, another day when the temperature swung sixty-three degrees in eight hours. Were also in Tornado Alley, so every spring swirling, howling charcoal demons materialize out of the air and shred mobile homes as if they were dropped in huge blenders.
Were not far from Iowa, which marks the unofficial border to the South, so one sees more than enough pickup trucks decorated with stickers of Confederate flags and slogans proclaiming their brand of truck is superior to all others.
There are a lot of things about this city that the chamber of commerce wont tell you, like the fact that we have more than quadruple the rate of mental illness per capita than any other city in the state, or that in the 80s the EPA did a very discreet study of the towns water supply in hope of finding a cause. The chief inspector on that case was found dead inside one of the water towers a week later, which was considered strange since the largest opening into the tank was a valve just ten inches wide. It was also considered strange that both of his eyes were fused shut, but thats another story.
But all that aside, its not a bad town. Not really.

3467,"2011-11-27",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2013 Ive had this one (a 2009) for a couple of years; was going to drink it when the Vikings went to the Super Bowl with Brett Favre, but the Saints had something else in mind. Anyway, this is as good as Ive been led to believe. Pours very black, thick, almost oily with a pretty thick head that takes a second or two to firm up. Theres coffee and fruit and chocolate in the aroma. And the flavor contains all those and more. Theres an almost sweet/sour fruity cherry tang to the flavor in addition to all the thick chocolate and coffee flavors. I only wish it was a bit easier to get ahold of a bottle of this stuff.**Update**: Now drinking a bottle of the 2011 batch. I think maybe this needs to age a couple of years? Its good, but more ""boozy"" (i.e., definite alcohol flavor) than I remember the 2009 being. Theres a very strong licorice/anise flavor to this batch as well that I dont recall from the 2009.","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"

""Dear Shirly I am quite drunk but I like your appearance.
Please take off your golden top!
Wow! You have a good looking head and a gorgeous looking black body.
I like your looks. You look spicy enough to keep me warm this night, though I hope you will not only keep me warm but give my buds some equal taste as that of your lovely perfume.
Let me try to appreciate your heavenly smell in your taste too.
I guess it will be a pity to share you with my friends, I rather keep your gorgeous looking body to myself.
I like it how you smell, but I guess to taste you is even more heavenly.
Please streak my tongue with your oily body the same as you touched my nose earlier..
Oh, youre velvet, soft, touchy, light spicy yet sweet. You thought about it all. Is that some chocolate there? Wait, its dark chocolate! Talking about passion. And what is that, some roasted cocao you showed me earlier? ...show me some more, baby.
You have a rather roasty malted backbone.
Quite roasted on the hips. I guess you like coffee too... Maybe with a bit of brown sugars or sticky sweets.
Damn you are sweet to me! This might be a bit to sweet for me. I actually might share you with my friends after all.
I was quite scared when I saw you were a vampire in the beginning, but damn you are sexy... Please make sure, whenever you come over again, please make sure to bite me again."" Yours Sincerely, Countbeer.","Best of E-Town mit 2 Brauhausen, NETHERLANDS","Countbeer"

Had an 11 again on October 27, 2012 and a fresh bottle of 12 the same day.  Just as I remembered, nice dark pour with tan head.  Bumped my overall rating up to an 18 as there was not the bitterness at the finish with the 11 fresh.  

Re-rate on March 16, 2013 - vertical of 08 - 12 with Brian and Brandon.
Just going to put some interesting things I noticed.  The 11 was less hoppy and more sweet than when fresh.  The 10 was creamy, more alcohol and dry than the 12 and 11.  The 09 finished much more bitter than the others.  Wow the 08 is just not even the same beer as the others.  Much sweeter and had some dark fruit characteristics, seemed to be a quasi imperial stout and barley wine.

Loads of chocolate in there too - after it warms a bit it gets very rich and chocolatey.  A robust weekend breakfast draught.

3467,"2011-09-06",4.8,"UPDATED: SEP 7, 2011 Serving glass: Poured from magnificent 750ml bottle into Snifter.

Appearance: Exceedingly dark brown that might as well be black with a thick mocha head that mostly recedes, but only after several minutes.

Aroma: Very fruity aroma for a RIS, with a strong citrus hop bitterness. Some floral notes (roses?) are apparent as well as something akin to raw meat. The roasted aroma is quite low, with just a slight touch of chocolate.

Taste: Same as the aroma, it is very fruity, both due to the malts (plum, figs) and the hops (citrus). The citrus is especially off-putting, but in a good ""wow I didnt realize that could work"" way. Also notice some rich molasses, licorice and chocolate, with a nice mild bitterness at the end.

Palate: Low carbonation, full chewy body that is exceptionally smooth.

Thanks to whoever brought this to the Inaugural ""Imminent Liquidation Bottle Share"" Event. 2009 bottle poured into a taster glass.

A - Pours deep black with a small half finger tall tan head, dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving light lacing down the glass.

S - Some sweet chocolate, a light does of hops, dark roasted malt, earthy wood, lactose sweetness, and some light smoke. It has good overall balance. Not the best I have smelled but far from the worst.

T - Lots of dark roast up front giving way slowly to a mix of light hop bitterness, sweet chocolate, dark roasted coffee, light smoke, and some astringent wood helping to dry the pallet after consumption. Finish is dry with some lingering roast. Not exactly what I was expecting. I may have to get a bottle of this for myself and revisit this one.

M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. A bit too thin in the feel for my liking with some lingering dark roast in the finish.

D - Drinkability was not too bad. Well this was a bit of a letdown. I am not sure if it was just this bottle or what but I expected a lot more. I will have to get a bottle for myself to make sure.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

This long time want graciously provided to me by bauermj. Poured into my new Darkness glass that was sent by Beeruser in perfect timing.

Appearance
The beer flows forth languidly, boasting its full body and robust color. The collection in the glass is dense and blackened. An undertone of burnt red, much like the color of the wax that crowns this bottle, gives the beer warmth and character. The head is a yellowed khaki with a frothy and soft pretense. Creeping rings of lace adorn the glass in short order, fueled by the ever-present ring of foam.

Smell
Darkness carries with it aromas of soy sauce and tobacco that are uniquely its own. Rich molasses and brown sugar lay a sweetened backdrop to licorice, steak sauce and freshly laid mulch. The bouquet is indeed full of darkness but encompasses the realm of caramelized and aged sugars and sweets. A consideration of the final glass of the bottle yields strong aromas of prunes and hints of chocolate covered raisins.

Taste
The soy sauce and molasses flavors are the dominant ones. They grip the sides of the tongue with a sharp, rum soaked fruitcake flavor that is bracketed by sweet pipe tobacco. There is a milky creaminess that tries to push through but the denser molasses and anise flavors suppress it for the most part. As the glass warms, caramel and a faint citrusy hopping come out. A fleeting hint of smoke pops out just at the end, and only after this beer warms to room temperature.

Mouthfeel
The best part of this beer is the way it slides over the palate, offering little resistance. It feels frictionless. Its very low and fluffy soft carbonation furthers the effects of the full body. There is a little bit of stickiness left on the lips, but this is a sweet beer, that should be expected. Some alcohol warmth and an oily, licorice flavored coating is left behind for a long finish and aftertaste.

Overall
This is a great stout. Its large in stature and silky smooth and thick. It is, however, quite sweet and wrought with tobacco and soy sauce notes that get in the way of its roastiness. So, all things considered, this did not live up to what I expected from it.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","MbpBugeye"

3467,"2011-04-11",4.5,"750ml bottle thanks to grub. 2010 Vampire vintage.
Appearance : Pitch black with a small head.

Aroma : Lots of malt with great hops. Not so roasty. Light molasses. A bit sweet but rather balanced betweeen hops and malt.

Taste : Awesome silky carbonation. Awesome hops with nice roasted malt and molasses. Great hop kick on the finish. A bit resinous but not a lot. 

Overall : Different and outstanding. Packed with flavours but rather easy drinking. Awesome carbonation and overall palate. Silky. Great balance, not too sweet. Felt much better than Dark Lord 09 I had the week before. Much more elegant and refined. Appearance was a little bit disapointing... pretty much the only negative point.

The aroma is sweet and some roastiness. Smells good.

The beer is sweet and has a definite chocolate bitter / semisweet flavor to it. There is a nice maltiness to the beer that is really nice. Beer overall has a medium body and as it warms there is more caramel in the palate. Drinkability high and mouthfeel is high. Id be interested in the other vintages.

3467,"2011-03-25",4.3,"750 ml brown bottle. Vintage Vampire 2010 thanks to CLevar. A very black beer with a very big  and nice frothy head. The aroma is big with lots of citrus hops, piney but at the same time coffee and chocolate cake. Man this is hoppy. The taste is surprisingly smooth and really goes down too easy for 9.6% ABV. The taste leaves notes of tar, lots of dark fruits, and lemony which I suspec comes from the hops. The mouthfeel is thick, slick, and somewhat oily. I am really curious how an intentionally hoppy Imp Stout ages. The high amount of hops must help preserve and helps in the aging process. Im sure down the road the citrus/pine flavors will give way to more chocolate/coffee flavors as it develops.","San Antonio, Texas, USA","Hopper"
3467,"2011-03-24",4.0,"2010 bottle drank into my Darkness tulip...A dark as midnight night with a huge dark tan head. The head is amazing as it literally arises from beneath the beer foaming up a full four fingers. The head is two colors, dark tan on the bottom with a lighter color on the top. The retention and lacing are amazing...The aroma is muted from the 09 version in terms of the hops as they do not show through. Very malty, lots of sweet milk chocolate with a hint of grass on the back. Not what I was expected, but still pretty decent...The taste thankfully brings out more of the hops as this has a grassy hop backbone from start to finish. A lot of the sweetness is gone, only a little is left but as it warms the hops disappear too. This turns into a really boring beer, so disappointing.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

3467,"2011-03-09",3.8,"2008 Vintage. 750ml black and gold waxed and capped brown bottle. 55 degrees. Not my 1000th review but my 1000th beer tried!

It pours a thick black with a voluptuous tan head. The head is sandier and not as dark as most Russian Imperial Stouts. It holds like a marvel for a 2 year aged brew of this strength. It refuses to recede but as it does it coats my snifter with thick lacing.

The smell is absolutely wonderful. I was at a brewery today smelling the fest wort, and this one has a lot of that fresh wort smell, that honey-oatmeal like malt sugar smell. Also in there is chocolate, coffee, slight roastiness, rum, and that classic stout smell with a bit of fruitiness. There are raisins and dark cherries in it as well as some caramel and a slight nuttiness. The sweetness can be smelled though there is also a cutting bitterness and sharpness sin the smell. The alcohol is present merely as an addition to the complexity of this brew.

This one is pretty intense in the mouth, a sweeter, fruitier RIS. It smacks you initially with some caramel covered cherries and raisins, then another wave of vinous raisin/grape, and finally a bitter coffee/chocolate finish. The alcohol flashes itself, though not completely, it is a palate exhauster form start to finish.

Though a bit cloying, the mouthfeel is pretty epic for the style, it is smooth and thick with a present but not overbearing alcoholic burn. This is the ""liqueur"" beer as it holds a bit more sweetness and complexity tan your average Russian imperial stout.

Overall if they were to tone down the sweetness on this one it would reach epic levels of enjoyability, the nose is right on.

3467,"2011-03-03",4.3,"<2009 vintage> I had this on tap at both Bryant Bowl in uptown (Minneapolis) and at Groveland Tap (St. Paul)

Appearance:
came out jet Black with a nice 1-2 finger creamy tan head, nice and thick seafoamy but with that dark tan color. kind of like what you see on an espresso. you cant see through the beer with a flood light behind it (proably a bit of an exagerating, but its black)

I was so ready for this after waiting a long time to try it.

smell:
Brang to the nose and it was full of chocolaty notes and hints of coffee, a hair of nuttyness and some slight fruity notes(fig) I could smell some of that signature hoppiness of Surly through the entire inhale,  pine and grapefruit hops. Taste(along with mouthfeel):
a small mouthfull rolled over my tongue smooth as ever, almost like melted ice cream it was so creamy and smooth. a little oily on the lips. the milk chocolate sweetness came right away and moved towards a little bit of coffee as the backside hop bitterness moved in. I got a nice kick of fig on the sides and a pinch of nuttyness throughout. plenty of hoppiness to give it character and complexity. At 10% ABV i couldnt taste a drop of alcohol. if they have the ability to kick the ABV up a notch they could easily without one noticing.

Drinkablity:
does wanting an endless flow account for drinkability? it was only $6 for about 11 oz. after finding that out I got a 2nd... after finishing that, i wanted a third but i think i would have hit the floor so I finished with that.

3467,"2011-02-14",3.6,"Poured into a snifter. 2010 vintage.

5.0 A: Pours black. About three fingers of thick, mostly creamy, secondarily frothy medium-brown-colored head. Very good retention and lacing covering most of the glass.

4.5 S: Mighty chocolaty is my first impression. This has a great mixture of roasty and sweet aromas with the sweet being moderately stronger. Hops are readily apparent in the form of herbal and citrus. Sweet caramel, a touch of smoke, and some toastiness to cap it off. Very nice.

4.0 T: Taste is pretty good, though somewhat disappointing based on the nose. This isnt nearly as sweet as the nose suggests. Rather, hop bitterness is apparent and hop flavor is nearly as strong as the malts. Hop flavor comes in the form of citrusy orange, herbalness, and a touch of spiciness. Malts contribute milk chocolate, caramel, molasses, anise, a touch of smoke and fruitiness in the form of plum, prune, and parsimmon. The malts arent big and powerful like I like, but this is still pretty tasty.

3.5 M: Heavier medium body. Not the thick, rich imperial stout I was looking for. Moderate carbonation is a bit ""dead"" leaving the beer limp and heavy on the touch. However, this has a good creaminess to it and it otherwise smooth.

3.5 D: Gave this a 3.5 because the taste was a borderline 3.5. This is easily the best hoppy imperial stout out there, but Im not that big of a fan of that approach to stouts. I like big malty flavors and low hop contribution. Still, this is a pretty tasty and I think this will be damn good once the hops have time to fade.

The palate is super sweet!  I thought I was crossed into a sweet stout at first, but the finish was so clean for a near 10% offering.

3467,"2010-10-27",4.0,"750 ml bottle at home. Incredibly dark -- opaque and almost black (though its technically still dark brown).

Points for being unique -- theres more complexity here beyond the typical coffee/chocolate flavors. Pretty nice on the palate, though I think the hops take away from the stickiness I want. Its nice for the fall transition into winter, but this body wont do in colder times when I want something to make me feel super warm.

The aroma is moderately malty and moderately hoppy. There are notes of roasted grains, chocolate, grapefruit, pine needles, resin, dark and dried fruits, alcohol and a hint of licorice and coffee. The flavour is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately sour, lightly bitter. Thick mouthfeel, but not as much as many other Imperial Stouts. Medium to full body, average carbonation, very long finish with medium to heavy bitterness, moderately alcoholic. Wonderful aroma and very good appearence, perhaps too hoppy in the mouth and a bit abrasive for this reason and not as roasted as expected, but definately tasty. (9/5/8/4/17=4.3)



2010 vintage, 740 ml bottle. An opaque black beer, with a large. frothy, lightly lacing, mostly lasting, light brown/orange head. The aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, chocolate, coffee), moderately hoppy (grapefruit, resin, grass), with notes of blueberries, blackberries, alcohol,  some dried dark fruits, perhaps a touch of vanilla. The flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety, near to creamy texture, soft carbonation, very long finish with moderate to heavy bitterness, moderately alcoholic. Again, a very good and hoppy rendition, a little bit better than the 2009 version IMHO, due to the big depth and the lower acidity. However, not the biggest Imperial Stout out there, and its not necessarily a bad thing...
(9/5/9/4/18=45)

2011 vintage. An opaque pitch black beer, with a small, frothy, lacing, mostly diminishing light brown head. The aroma is moderately to heavily malty (chocolate, roasted grain, caramel, hint of coffee), moderately hoppy (resin, grapefruit), with notes of berries, raisin, plums, with a touch of vanilla and alcohol, maybe a hint of smoke/tobacco. The flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium to full body, creamy/velvety texture, soft carbonation, very long finish with moderate to heavy bitterness, moderately alcoholic. By seeing my notes the maltier version. The hops are still very present though, especially in the finish. A little more alcohol burn in the aftertaste than I remeber in the two previous vintages. Again very fruity, but I didnt remeber the note of smoke, although very light.

2012 vintage. an opaque black beer, with a large, frothy, lacing, fully lasting brown head. The aroma is moderately to heavily malty (chocolate, fudge, roasted grain, caramel, hint of coffee), moderately hoppy (grapefruit, resin), with notes of licorice, vanilla, alcohol, raisins, plums. The flavor is heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, very long finish with almost heavy bitterness, moderately alcoholic. It looks great and smells complex and the taste is even more hop-oriented than the already hoppy previous editions. In this case it almost seems an Imperial Black IPA . Mostly velvety mouthfeel that somehow tends to be syrupy instead of creamy like in the prevoius editions. Not quite mindblowing like the last year still a 4+ beer in my book.

Aroma of roasted malt and black chocolate with some light liquorice and dry coffee notes is quite enjoyable. Taste is also a heavy mix between some roasted malt with light bitter notes with rich black chocolate notes and very subtle notes of liquorice and dry fruits. Sweetness is very well balanced and not nearly as cloying as Dark Lord. Body is full with good carbonation and warming notes are perceptible though nothing too heavy.

A: Pitch black body. Massive dark brown-khaki head. Lasted for a few minutes before crashing into a thin, frothy skim. Rather dense lacing up and down the glass. 

S: So many things are going on here. Molasses, chocolate, coffee, citrus hop bitterness, caramel. With each inhale the molasses seems to grow more dominating. If that was toned down just a bit everything else would come together flawlessly.

T: Sweet milk chocolate, brown sugar and molasses are prevalent up front. Slight undertones of coffee and dark chocolate. Lively bitterness throughout. Some fig and raisin like fruityness.

M: Surprisingly thin at first. Not exactly ""watery"" though. But it didnt have the weight and consistency I was expecting though. No booze burn. As the beer warmed more heft was apparent.

D: I originally poured this into two glasses to share with the lady, but I stole what was left of her half after I finished mine. The sweetness, in the end, killed me as it wasnt as easy to get through the last few ounces as it was with the first dozen or so

All in all a top notch stout that shows you can do big bold flavors without making it a flammable bourbon barrel aged brew. Reminds me of an amped up Victory Storm King Stout.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

Raisin, fig, caramel, saltwater toffee, and milk chocolate all swirl together into the ultimate torrent of flavors. A slight hop bitterness acts as a balancer, but is largely overshadowed by the huge sweet sugar profile. The palate is rich, thick, velvety, and massive.

3467,"2010-06-03",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2011 2007: Bottle #483. Poured into a tulip glass a dark black/brown color with a slight tan collared head. Roasted aroma with dark chocolate. Very slightly sweet start with a very strong bitter chocolate roasted aftertaste. Some booze is evident. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. The most roasted flavor out of the 07-10 iterations. I would call the 07 the ""roasty,dry version""

2008: Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass the usualy brown/black color with a nice tan head, way more carbonated than the 07 vintage. Roasty, dark chocolate aroma. Extremely sweet compared to 07 version which in my opinion isnt very sweet at all. Starts with a sweet start with flavors of molasses and brown sugar and stays sweet the entire time. Some bitterness in the middle. Its actually pretty decent IF you like sweet stouts, it not, then you probably wont like this years. 
I would call the 08 the ""sweet version""

2009: Had this on tap at Hells Kitchen for the release party. Served in a small goblet.
Extremely dark color with dark tan head, just like a RIS should look. Had a more subdued smell than I was expecting but picked up notes of coffee and sweetness. The flovor profile starts sweet but has a huge hoppy bitterness to it that is unlike most RISs. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Very drinkable and smooth. I have several bottles of this and cant wait to see what its like with some aging! 
I would call the 09 the ""hoppy version""

2010: Less hoppy than the 09 version and better balanced. The appearance is not much different than the other years with the classic brown/black with a dark tan head. Aroma is more balanced than previous years with a both roasted, chocolate notes along with some hop bitterness. The flavor profile is pretty balance with a sweet start that is rounded out with roast notes and dark chocolate. Lingering bitterness. Medium/heavy mouthfeel.
I would call the 10 the ""balanced version""

3467,"2010-05-27",4.1,"Darkness 08 and Darkness 09 side by side. Thanks Brian and Chris!

A- Body is a thick, dark, almost black hue. Pours with a small foamy off white head which dissolves to a thin collar and leaves traces of lacing behind in the glass.

S-Earthy hops, a hint of alcohol, a hint of cocoa and roasted malt, and anise. Decent balance and slightly mild.

T- There is a faint herbal/earthy hop accent initially with a mild roasted malt backbone. Chocolate and anise flavors come rushing through for the finish and are more prominent than the initial flavors. Mild impressions of the initial flavor linger.

P- low carbonation with a syrupy medium to heavy weight body that is slightly thin.

O- Overall- I REALLY like this beer. Its very good overall. The 08 and the 09 were very similar in overall profiles so I didnt comment on individual differences because I noticed few, if any. Id still like to try this beer fresh when the hoppy notes tend to really shine. ABV was pretty well hidden here as well.

Nice, balanced nose, the most dominant element being a sugary chocolate sweetness. The hops draw out the sweetness in contrast, making the nose lightly syrupy, but the roasted malt and anise help balance. The flavor is equally interesting, light chocolate and anise with an oaty malt through the lightly hoppy finish, many flavors rolling around in the generally, if partially overdone, sweetness. Chewy body tops it off. Decadent stuff, possibly over-sweet, but on the whole delicately balanced and intriguingly complex even if none of the elements is that unique.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

A-an aggressive pour produces huge espresso colored head that is extremely thick and creamy. the retention is very good and it completely coats the glass as it slowly works down the glass. the beer is just one shade from pitch black and lets a hint of a red hue through with a maglite shined on it. very attractive beer!

S-the nose is average in strength. there is a light aroma of chocolate, molasses and tobacco that is taken over by the smell of sweet dark fruits. there is some dark cherries and raisins. the end brings a fair amount of hops, it actually has quite a hop profile. mostly citrusy hops

T/M-this is extremely thick, creamy, and chewy, very good feel. the body is quite full as it rolls down the throat. the taste is quite nice and bold. it brings dark chocolate up front, the dark cherry and raisins come in to complement the chocolate, some citrus hops and light bitterness fade in at the finish.

A-pours jet black liquid with dark tan colored head
S-the nose is nice, molasses up front, notes of dark chocolate, caramel and toffee undertones.  the back has some fruity sweetness, raisins and cherries with notes of booze.  still a faint citrus hop note, cant be but seems to be.
T-the taste is quite sweet, not a ton of roasted malts happening here.  a good bit of molasses, notes of anise and dark chocolate. lots of sweetness in the back, cherries, plums, touch of raisin.  hops arent really present here.
M-full body, just a little thin, but so smooth and creamy, low carbonation but tight to hold the body.  silky on the throat.
D-quite sweet but ever so smooth.  one of the best feels on beer you can imagine.  booze is gone, just present in nose, none in the taste.

Its pitch black, and the head is huge, creamy and lasting, at first dark brown at the bottom and lighter towards the top, gradually all of it becomes nougat-colored. The aroma is complex with notes of roasted malt, berries and very light berry sourness, prunes and other dark/preserved fruits, chocolate, light cheese and licorice. The mouthfeel is fat and oily. The flavour has a moderate sweetness and a very light berry-acidity like in cherries, notes of berries, roasted malt, chocolate, preserved dark fruits, light dry citrus (mostly grapefruit) and in the finish licorice, but towards the very slightly dry and bitter end, I also find a hint of coffee.

A: The pour is viscous, black, and wonderful. It fills the glass with a fluffy mocha colored head on top of the thick liquid below.

S: Generally with an RIS (or any stout, really) you dont expect citrus and pine hops to be the primary aroma, but thats just what we have here. The malt and other traditional RIS aromas dont come through quite as much as I would have liked. Still, the malt and chocolate and coffee do come through at times.

T: The hoppiness is still present on the tongue, but not quite as intensely. A good roasted malt background with some hints of coffee and chocolate. Perhaps a bit of dark fruits as well, which go interestingly with the hoppiness.

M: The body is nice and full and the beer feels quite creamy on the tongue. The carbonation is at a moderate level.

D: The booze is hidden very well by the myriad of flavors that are present. I wish, however, that this was more RIS like and not basically a black DIPA.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

Honestly, the bitterness of the hops was reminiscent of that smell you get of hop blow-off in a homebrew.  It actually reminded me a bit of the sludge at the bottom of the Dark Lord that one year.  Too bad, not for me, but I can understand how it could appeal to many.  Should note that this was Imperial stout 100 for me.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

Shared with 12many.  Of course this thing pours extremely dark and has a thick brown head.  Aroma is a mix of chocolate, hops, and some kind of candy.

Pitch black with decent pale beige head that leaves a lot of creamy lacings.

Wonderful aromas of roasted malts, dry coffee notes, rich fruity notes (plums, cherries, figs) and hints of spicy hops. Very balanced and very impressive.

The taste is nothing but fantastic - really balanced and spot on. Everything is where its supposed to be. The flavors are very complex - sweetness from the malts, salt licorice and a bitter finish. Powerful roasted malty aromas and notes of luscious dark fruits, a hint of molasses, tannins, coffee, wood and leafy hops. The finish is somewhat dry and bitter with notes of licorice, leafy hops and malts.

Full-bodied with a fat and creamy malty mouthfeel. Gentle carbonation.

Almost unbelievably good. Very balanced. The composition is like a symphony - carefully orchestrated with everything at its proper place.

The first thing I noticed was the incredible amount of hoppiness in the nose.  Roasty too.  A rather simple aroma, but delightful.  Nearly black pour with two fingers of creamy brown head.  Sticky lacing is already from me moving the glass around.  Wow!  What a mouthful.  Creamy, thick, and full of flavor.  Nothing really stands out except the hops.  Everything else blends together so well.  Roast, chocolate, and espresso.  With this perfect amount of hops it is just throwing me for a loop...  I love Dark Lord and this is right on par with it.

Flavors of grapefruit, pine, tons of bitter hops, loads of roasted malts, some chocolate and coffee mixed in with some caramel and toffee flavors to round it out. This is a very, very hoppy imperial stout if that what you want to categorize it as. It is almost an imperial black IPA  but there is still a huge roasted malt backbone that brings a nice balance. Has very hoppy aroma and flavor, yet is extremely smooth without the huge bitterness you would expect from the hop bill needed to generate these hoppy flavors. I am truly impress by this brew.

This would start the endless confusion of my darkness experience.  I mean, i liked the nose, but i dont think i liked that nose coming from an imperial stout.  An IPA, maybe...but an imperial stout?  Unfortunately, the flavors did nothing to solve my issues.  This tastes like a black IPA to me.

3467,"2009-11-11",4.3,"On tap at the Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL. Man was I happy I got to this beer before it ran out tonight. The pour was as expected. Just plain black and quite ominous looking. It also came with a big and creamy/wispy mocha head with lace galore. This was a classy and very pretty imperial stout. The nose overall was far from overpowering, but the best way I can describe is that it was just so pleasant. There were lots of creamy mocha and nutty black grains that made for a powdery, hazy malt mixture in the aroma. The smell was also subtly yet nicely balanced with some earth and a vague light citrus. Upon sipping, this beer starts off with a bit of a pop, and then turns nicely into smooth and full feel. The finish then appears like its about to dry out, but then keeps a strong hold of the sweetness in the end. I really liked how the two sides seemed to go back and forth throughout the experience. Flavors notes for this one consisted of a good amount of dark malts, a nutty mocha, good roasted grains, some dark fruits, with a solid backing of hop with thick citrus and light melon.

3467,"2009-10-26",4.5,"2008 vintage bottle split three ways in tulip glasses. It was nice and viscous coming out of the bottle. A small tan head rose form each pour then settled to a thin lace but a simple swirl of the glass would bring it back. The body of the brew was a midnight black with light maroon highlights.

The first aroma I got was a slight oxidation which was to be expected with the age. Then I got some wonderful aromas of molasses, brown sugar and some slight dark fruits.
The brew was towards the sweet side again I would expect it was from the age but it really made for an enjoyable sipping experience. Again I got the molasses, a hint of vanilla and dark fruits. I must say the roasted malts were showing up more as sweet chocolate than a roasted coffee note, Which added a bit uniqueness to the flavor. The brew was thick and viscous in your mouth with a slight carbonation for the tongue. Just the way I like a stout.

A great stout I would stand in line for it. The glass went down dam easy. I didnt get any hint of the alcohol seeing it was a 10%brew. I would gladly drink it again. big thanks to Packforever1976 for hooking me up

3467,"2009-08-23",4.4,"2008 vintage, the coolest looking bottle I have seen that wasnt Gratitude. 

Pour is just perfect, black and thick as used motor oil with a thick tan head. Not a highlight in sight. 

Scent is of strong sweet molasses over chocolate and an earthy aroma. Dark fruit is present as well. 

Taste is incredibly sweet. Lactose, molasses, bitter chocolate. Its like nestle quick that wasnt stirred enough, and thats a good thing. This reminds me more of a milk stout than your typical ris. 

Mouth is full and creamy, as thick as it looks. Low carbonation. Just perfect.

3467,"2009-08-21",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 24, 2011 Sampled @ GTMW 09 - The first sample of the day, so I had a nice, fresh palate. Darkness pours, well dark. Theres a frothy brown head, but youre not seeing through this sucker. The smell is sweet and syrupy, which is what I usually like in an IS. Theres toffee, raisins, and bourbon. Taste is more of the same--sweet, deep flavors with a minimum of roast and a nice hop finish.  Its thick and smooth, and makes me wish I had a bottle of this stuff. Wasnt sure if the hype was justified, but now Ive circled next Darkness Day on my calendar and saving my money for a 6-bottle allotment.

Re-rate 11/28/09 - Got my 6 bottles, but sampled from a buddies bottle. Same notes as before, but the 2009 vintage has wonderful waves of hops on the nose and in the taste. Adds a layer of complexity that I dig, and separates it from some of the other impys Ive had. Bumped it up for palate, too, since the larger sample was wonderfully smooth and mouth-coating. About as good as it gets.

Re-rate 10/24/11 - Holy crap has my palate changed. The 11 vintage is fairly close the 08 that I loved initially, and I couldnt even finish my pour. Too sweet, sticky, syrupy, and boozy. Its just too...much. The hoppiness of the 09 would still probably make this a pleasant beer for me, but not in mass quantities, and definitely not a 4.7.

Taste is very much the same, just fantastic.  I agree that some people rate a beer higher, just because it everyone else says it is good.  This beer is GREAT no matter what anyone else says.

Poured a enough to make a nice review, but not pass out.

A - Jet black, coffee/cream colored head, sticky lacing along the side of the snifter. Pretty much similar to all other top-notch examples of this style.

S - Sweet chocolate, molasses, raisins. Smells so good I would like to eat this beer instead of drink. One whiff and Im ready to dig in to my dessert! Nothing overly complex, but damn good nonetheless. 

T - Chocolate cake with chocolate cream filling topped with chocolate sprinkles and chocolate syrup. In other words, lots of chocolate here! No real alcohol burn present and when compared to Dark Lord, almost zero (I realize DL is 13% though). Very sweet, no real hops/bitterness at all. Its like drinking chocolate syrup (in a good way).

M - A little more thin then what I was expecting but oh-so smooth. It just covers your mouth in sweet goodness! 

D - Very easy to drink for the style. I will revisit in another six months or so to see how its coming along. All in all, a great RIS, worthy of the rating and hype.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"

Aroma has a lot of raisin, red wine scents, maybe a little citrus. What I didnt expect was the sweet hop aroma. On the other hand, theres not the usual coffee or chocolate on the nose. Flavor is initially sacchariny sweet, but after you get past that you can make out a lot of sweet fruit (cherry), dark gourmet chocolate, medium maltiness for the style, espresso oils. Alcohol is well hidden. I really have to emphasize that this is one sweet pancake syrup. And this is coming from one who likes huge, sugary impys and barleywines. But the sweetness in this one has even my ass kicked, otherwise it deserved a 10 in flavor because of complexity and richness. Mouthfeel is full and gooey like an impy should be.

750 bottle #174 (2007), black over maroon wax into Reidel Vinum Cab glass...

Pours a black coffee brown with a maple/peanut butter-colored head (1 finger) that comes and goes, leaving sparse bubbles in the middle of the glass. Very viscous...sparse to decent lacing but solid trails up and down the glass.

One word...bountiful. Hearty malt candy sweetness with salty roasted peanuts and extremely deep caramel and chocolate malt. Alcohol wraps up in the thickness of it all. Is there enough room for hops? A cool bitterness of grass and slight pine detected. Aroma mellows slightly after pouring and with time.

This, for all its depth and complexity, is much drier on the palate than on the nose. Grass hop profile comes about with slight pine in the back. Salty peanut brittle forward malt taste. I know the sweetness...I know theres alcohol, but its quite contained. Bittersweet chocolate emerges and strengthens with warmth. Absolutely love the dryness of this.

After a while the alcohol gets a little warm but it works in Beautiful Chemistry with the dry, chocolate coffee texture along with solid hop wilderness. Slowly slides down the palate in its extreme viscosity. Finish is slow and sultry. In spots theres slight emptiness but the holes get filled in right quick.

Im a little surprised at just how absent they were, but not too  disappointed because I generally dont like hoppy stouts.

The finish is moderately to heavily sweet and lightly bitter with some light acidity. Full body with a creamy, milkshake like, texture. Lively carbonation. Lacks complexity.

3467,"2009-06-09",2.2,"22oz 2008 bottle split with jcr and UnclePete: We saved this bottle to drink for both my dad and myselfs 1000 rating. I dont want to be the guy that rags on a beer just because it is rare and rates high, but this was absolutely lackluster to me.  It was a complete sugary trainwreck that was nearly undrinkable. Ive had lots of high ABV imperials before that simply blow this away. Finesse was not in the brewers mind when this was made. None of the three of us could finish our 7oz portions.  We saved our 1000th rating for a different beer.  Bummer.  


Oil can black pour with a great, thick mocha head. The nose is appealing, as the sugary sweet chocolate and raisin notes literally jump from the tulip. The first sip goes down harsh - an unexpected gulp of white sugar sticking to all sides of the mouth. The coffee and chocolate notes that are present are nice, but the cloying, viscous liquid is way too sweet to appreciate them. The bitterness does attempt to balance things out, but fails miserably under the weight of the sugar.  Undrinkable.



Interesting side note - after we all drank as much of our portions as we could, we decided this beer would be the perfect candidate for a ""beer float."" I grabbed the vanilla ice cream and we each added a small dollop to our remaining portions. What I thought would be a super-sweet treat ended up completely different. I dont know if some strange chemical reaction happened, but the sugars in the beer and the sugars in the ice cream must have neutralized each other as all we could taste was bitterness. Very strange.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

Carbonation is very fine and perfect for the style. Aroma is a mix of chocolate, light coffee, a solid pine resin note and then the sweetness, the most dominate part of the aroma, comes through as raisin and prune juice. Flavors mix superbly with the chocolate and prune flavor really complimenting the later resin notes that come through.  Very smooth and creamy feeling.

This gargantuan Imperial Stout achieves stupendous flavor nuances with its coating molasses and dark chocolate malt character blending into piney and citrusy hop elevations, all in the most luxurious body where alcohol barely tickles the palate. This is gum-licking goodness. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the pitch blackness.
-Its decadent body is never obese.
-Peppery spiciness seems to stem from the gorgeous malt-hop union.
-It had been a while since I hadnt gotten so excited by an Imperial Stout!
-This is more drinkable and better put together than Dark Lord, and almost as complex as Expedition Stout. Very impressive indeed.

Aroma shows chocolate, fudge, vanilla, brownie/cake and pretty intense hops.  Reminds me of the Yetis, or my memory of them at least.  Fairly complex and unique aroma that lets you know this isnt your run of the mill Imperial Stout.  Flavor is sweet, thick, chocolate, just on the edge of cloying.  Very rich with a sticky, very full bodied and thick mouthfeel.  This might be a tad too sweet.  I like the viscosity but the apparent sweetness is a tad too high.

Different than I was expecting but tasty nonetheless. 11/1/09 Sipping on an 09 courtesy of MaSciGuy. Black, chocolaty, and really hoppy.  This is really easy to drink.

The aroma shows huge amounts of bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit, figs, cherries, and some roasted coffee. Some earthy hops come through as well, but not heavily hopped like I thought it would be. The flavor follows with more of the bittersweet and milk chocolate varieties blending with the figs, raisins, and cherries. A slight bitterness is provided on the backend from the earthy hops. I was hoping for more of the roasty elements, but the chocolate and fruity sweetness dominate this beer. Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation and slick on the palate. This one drinks easily and goes down smooth with the chocolate covered cherries lingering in the finish.

Pours a pure black color with a large creamy brown head. The aroma was amazing; huge dark fruits, sweet molasses, caramel, chocolates and rich coffee. Sweet plums especially in the amazing nose. The flavor was amazing as well; initial dark fruits give way to a fizzy and bitter hops. The core of this beer though is a rich chocolate, roasted malt and super decadent coffee mix.The flavor is more than just balanced, you can detect tons of hops, tons of fruit and tons of sweetness. The mouthfeel is very creamy and full. The beer leaves a sludgy leg running down the glass. Amazing. One of the best things Ive ever drank.

A little whiff of citrus as well. I am expecting hops. Suprisingly not a hoppy IS, contrary to what I had heard. I also heard this beer is different than it used to be. This is a new batch.

3467,"2009-03-31",4.2,"08 version.  Pours a bit lighter than I was expecting, but with a beautifully thick head.  Displays a lighter floral aroma with a bit of citrus.  Not nearly as intense as I was expecting from what folks had said about the previous years vintage.    Huge creamy character that really stood out.  Very much the calling card of this vintage.  A dryer overall beer and quite easy drinking compared to other beers in its class that leave a much higher finishing gravity.  However, too sharp of a contrast between the sweet/roasted malt backbone and the citrus/orange hop profile.  Overall, it left me a bit confused.  It seemed like it was trying to be both a sweeter/creamier imperial stout and one of the more highly hopped examples of the genre at the same time.  While I really loved the first side of this along with how nicely attenuated the gravity was, and is why my score is so high, I really didnt care for the choice of hops.  They just seemed to detract a bit from the overall experience.  I know there was a change in the recipe, particularily in the type of hops used, but I think they wouldve been better off doing what made this beer so exceptional initially.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"

A: First and foremost its one bad ass looking bottle. Pours a deep dark black hue with a nice bubbly one finger head on my pour. There were spots of lacing noted.

S: Nice hoppy aromas right from the start. There were hints of roasted malts and chocolate along with bitter coffee. It had a somewhat green aroma beneath the roast. The ABV makes itself known in the nose as well.

T: This is a hoppy ass stout. Tons of bitter hops noted as soon as it hit my tongue. Beautifully roasted chocolaty malt does come thru as does a hint of vanilla, a nice dose of smoke, and a touch of dark fruit. A slight alcohol burn lingers after each gulp.

M: Full in body, rich and somewhat syrupy.

D: The beer is sort of sharp on the tongue. I could of had more than my 1/6 of the bottle but this is one to be shared.

How: Bottle 22oz, 2008 vintage.  Huge thanks to both Levi (MatSciGuy) and Scott (Oakbluff) for sending bottles my way.
The look: Black body topped by a large tan head with very good retention.
In long: Nose of bakery chocolate and green hops.  The one truly striking feature about this beer is a soft and velvety the body is.  This is like drinking creamy silk.  Relaxed carbonation of cushiony mouthfeel.  Medium-low roastiness.  Taste of artisan bakery chocolate, some over-backed fruit pie (dates, prunes, and such), rich dark caramel, distant coffee.  This is not your usual bitter black chocolate flavour, this really tastes like bakery chocolate (the fancy little pieces).  And lets not forget the hops, this beer packs quite a bit of American hops and they work very well the bakery chocolate.  Freshly cut green grass, citrus fruits and tobacco leaves add a lot of depth and also lighten the beer up.    A truly fantastic and highly drinkable beer.  Finally a hyped impy stout that lives up to the hype.  If like me you were loosing hopes after too many over-hyped impy stouts disappointments (Kate The Great, Sexual Chocolate, Bourbon Barrel Aged xyz) then Im telling you, dont loose hope there is a Darkness at the end of the tunnel.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

750 ml bottle generously given to me by Dansting, who also was responsible (as a volunteer) for the huge amount of wax that was on this bottle.  2011 Vintage.  The pour is black with a thick 1/2 inch khaki head. The head falls with thick lacing.  The aroma is faint tropical fruit hops, good amount of roast, and a sweet molasses which becomes more prominent as the beer hits room temperature.  The taste is sweet cane sugar molasses, then turns to the roast, which is more mild than it was in the nose, and then turns back to more sweetness in the finish, this time with some vanilla notes. Really mostly about the sweet, which covers the booze nicely, but overwhelms all of the hops, and most of the pleasant roast character. The palate is medium to heavy bodied, with a softer natural carbonation, and the lingering sweetness.  My palate has changed since I first had this beer, I am certainly less interested in the sweetness many Imperial Stouts have.  For history sake, Ill keep my score from the original rating.  Thanks for this one Dan.  (7,4,8,4,14 - 3.7).

750 ml bottle, red waxed and capped.  2008 Vintage, graciously picked up at Darkness day for me by my parents.  Pour is jet black with beautiful cascading leading up to a thick, four inch deep tan head.  Head is foamy at the top, but very lasting.  Patchy lacing.  Initial aroma is semi-sweet dark chocolate and straight cocoa powder.  After the initial wave, nice melding of roast coffee, malt and some hops.  I thought the hop was pine straight away, but turned more towards a citrus peel bitterness.  Sweetness is a little syrupy, though that helps cover up the alcohol almost entirely.  Nice nose.  Taste is the sweet cocoa roast coffee citrus hops all kind of rolled into one.  Nice solid integration of all of the flavors, and with the nose, alcohol was well hidden.  A decent blast of pineapple-cherry sugary sweetness pops out in the aftertaste.  There is a decent burning in the chest, however.  Palate is actually a bit thinner than I would have expected, medium, a little oily and a long somewhat bitter finish - that turns sweet, almost cloyingly so towards the end.  I would say the palate was my least favorite part of the beer.  Overall, nice Imperial Stout.  Thanks Mom and Dad! (8,5,8,3,16 - 4.0)","Kansas, USA","theisti"

I came away from this experience wondering how many calories in sugar I just ingested.  Tasty, and gets points for flavor and complexity, but overall too sweet for me.","I F&ckin hate those guys from, Ohio, USA","Rogueone"

Super sweet flavor of molasses and licorice with a slight hop finish.  Alcohol is well hidden on this beast.  Worth the trade.
UPDATE 7/8: Yyyyeah, pretty sure I rated this one on prestige before.  Very good, but not as good as I rated it.  Got to try the 08 again as well as the 07 at Muckfest and its too sweet to be up there with some other ones Ive rated so high.  Dropping it down a bit.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"

Thin sheet of lacing on the glass. Aroma of sweet malt, charred wood, molasses and licorice. Rich, velvety body with loads of caramel and sweet malt flavor, as well as molasses and chocolate liqueur notes. Just enough hops to keep the organized chaos of sweetness in check. The finish is mocha and caramel with a lingering malty sweetness left over. Excellent overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

This one pours out black with a fat brown head on it.  The smell is just out of this world.  It smells like a double IPA fresh off the line with a huge amount of chocolate and coffee infused into it.  The taste is really good, very sweet, full of coffee and chocolate and of course a very healthy dose of these hops.  This beer is very unique, almost sessionable.  The best beer I have drank in several years, hands down.  I always thought I would never give a second 5 rating, but I believe I have to make an exception.  The smell on this beer is perfect, so is the taste, the beer does wonders to the palate because it is not too thick and not too thin, and the enjoyment factor is off the chart.  This is a perfect beer in my eyes.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

3467,"2009-01-14",4.3,"<b>1/14/2009</b>:  Surly Darkness has a nearly black color with red highlights and a dense, tan-colored head.  This beer has a seriously rich and caramelized aroma accompanied by welcomed vineous and sweet orangy-citrus hoppiness.  The flavor is quite sweet with a predominent orage citrus syrup hop flavor.  That runs throughout the flavor and is integrated into the rich, creamy milky chocolate and sweet caramelized maltiness.  This beer is full bodied and it is unbelieveably smooth (smoother and creamier than milk) and nothing like I expected.  However, if it isnt anything in your mouth though, it is sticky as crap everywhere else.  It isnt the typical chocolate/coffee/roasty impy stout.  This is something more and very difficult to describe.  The hop flavors are large, but well-balanced - no well-integrated - into the other underlying flavors.  The flavor and texture just hangs there.  Wow, very interesting and different and memorable and very different that any other Imperial Stout that I have had.

3467,"2009-01-13",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 21, 2009 Rating #400.  Bottle courtesy of Ed at Heritage.  Quite possibly the most generous act of beer sharing I have yet to see.  Cracked this at the 09er for friends.  Pours like motor oil with a pillowy tan head.  Smells of charcoal, wood, and hops which carry into the flavor.  Very earthy.  Tastes of added notes of dark fruit, caramel, bakers cocoa, and faint coffee.  Noticeable alcohol on the finish.  Dangerously drinkable.

RERATED: On tap at Hop Leaf.  Pours inky black with a reddish brown head.  Aggressive with grapfruity hops, smoked bacon, and soy sauce.   Puts a hurt on your palate.  Drinking a pint of this felt like an accomplishment.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","nbutler11"

3467,"2009-01-12",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2016 TAP: at Stub & Herbs in Minneapolis - was lucky enough to get a pint at the 2008 release party. Pours jet black with a tan head. Aroma is rich, roasty, chocolate, dark fruits, hops, and the taste is similar, along with caramel and the higher ABV presence. Tremendous beer with lots of character - quite possibly the best beer I have ever had.

Re-Rate: was able to try 2008 (tap) and 2009 (tap) side-by-side (thanks Al!). I get a little more fig/port flavor out of the 2008, and a little more hop out of the 2009. The hop profile may be a function of aging, but it seems as though the flavor is different as well. I prefer the 2008.

Re-Rate: 2010 is here! Had it on tap at Blue Nile and at Pracna. Still the deep rich pour with the foamy chocolately head. I get a little bit of tart cherry in this years batch - just a bit hiding in there. Hop profile / roastiness seems comparable to the 2009 version. Plenty of chocolate in this. 

2011 is here! Im getting more bitter hop profile and smooth chocolate this year. Still awesome.

2012 is here! Seems to be a throwback to a few years prior when the beer was a bit sweeter - this is awesome.

2013 is here! This is very sweet, perhaps overly so. Still rich and awesome.

3.16.2013: just did a 2008-2012 5 year vertical of this: my order is 2008, 2010, 2009, 2011, 2012. 2010 is amazing. 2008 is ridiculous. 

2014 is here! Rating the non-barrel aged version here. Again, very sweet, but still as decadent as ever.

2015 - didnt like this one as much as prior years.

2016 - getting a hint of band aid in the aroma, odd. This on tap at Surly too. Taste is rich, dense, and sweet. Maybe a little sweeter than 2015? Would need to try side by side to confirm.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"

Pour was dark black with chocolate colored head, steady retention. The Aroma was strong Pac-NW hops, citrus and pine, really way more than anything in the base beer, not sure I would even have told you blindly the style. Flavor was very nice although not what I expected, the hops playing a flavor role (not adding a ton of bitterness), chocolate notes at the fore, yet vinous and dark fruits very prominent. The mouthfeel was much thinner than I expected and also featured some acidity and carbonation to keep it pretty clean. A nice brew, but overhyped a bit too.

Im not fond of hoppy stouts so was worried i wouldnt like this but its really quite lovely... though pine does build quite a lot over time 4.3...

3467,"2008-11-30",4.0,"2008 vintage, courtesy Redlight.  Big thanks Brent!  Pours an inky, deep, dark mahogany to virtually black color.  A dense, compact head of coffee colored foam crowns the surface, thick cobweb lacing marking the glass well.  Expecting a roasty hop bomb of a RIS, I was surprised by the sweet, chocolaty, heavily fruited aroma.  Notes of stewed figs and prunes show strong, as do creamy oats and heaps of bittersweet chocolate.  Earthy, spicy hops do show, but not as intensely as has been described in so many previous ratings.  Flavors, too, are quite sweet.  Semi-sweet and bittersweet chocolates blend well with the stewed mash of figs, prunes, raisins and cherries.  Earthy hops offer an attempt at balance, but ultimately fall short, while rolled oats serve to unite contrasting elements.  Medium-full on the palate and moderately carbonated, I would like just a touch more body, less sugar, and more roast.  Is this a great beer?  By all means.

Appearance: Pours an inky black body with a large, frothy, light tan head.

Smell: Roasty, burnt malt nose with strong notes of dark chocolate liqueur, coffee, smoky creosote, and pine needles.

Taste: Roasty, dark, chocolaty maltiness displays both depth and richness. A few spoonfuls of frothed cream pairs with a flavor of strong coffee. Bracing amount of sweetness present. Vinous fruity character. Touch of creosote. Strong pine and citrus hoppiness though not unreasonably so. The bitterness makes a decent attempt, but, for me, it doesnt ever even begin to overtake the malt sweetness. Darkness finishes with a strapping roastiness and more unyielding sweetness.

3467,"2008-11-20",4.3,"Review #400 so lets make it Darkness. Bottles courtesy of a couple of super generous traders in Surly country poured into a snifter.

Not surprising, its dark...pours jet black with hints of mahogany as it comes out of the bottle. The head is tan and three fingers high before receding to an inch-thick cap that lingers throughout with tons of lacing.

While not typical of the style, I found the aroma fascinating. The first smell was of floral hops, especially pine, along with some citrus. As it warmed, some of the dark malts and chocolate came out, but still with a heavy hop presence. It smells damn near like a DIPA. Crazy.

The taste steers back toward an RIS, but not all the way there. The initial taste is a quick citrus hop kick that tingles the tongue before the dark roasted malts and bakers chocolate melt the tingling away to a thick malty coating. The finish is a tad dry with a slight hop bitterness as well. The sweetness of dark fruits comes out much more as it warms, but again this is probably the hoppiest tasting RIS Ibe had.

The mouthfeel is truly exceptional. Very, very creamy but with the perfect amount of carbonation to help the flavors pop.

Well, this may not be the best RIS Ive had, but it is probably the most original. Id heard it was hoppy, but I just had no idea.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

3467,"2008-11-17",4.1,"(Thanks John, Kosko20, for hooking me up with this one!).  Popping this Friday afternoon to start off the birthday weekend with a bang.  2008 bottle.  Easy 5 on appearance: pitch black (though not an oily) pour with a great large mocha head that has great retention and leaves dense beautiful lace.  Aroma is holy shit!  I am not a huge fan of hops in stouts, but this is unbelievably well done.  Great doughy, chocolaty malt backbone that is complemented by an incredibly fresh and juicy citrusy grapefruit hop presence in perfect balance with each other.  The flavor is not as hoppy and perfect, but still very enticing  very chocolaty and rich upfront and fades into a bitter roasted coffee finish.  The finish is a bit hot, but generally the alcohol is hidden remarkably well.  The chocolate character is unlike any I have ever experienced for reasons that I cant put my finger on.  Some hop bitterness is beginning to accompany the hot alcoholic finish, and works well with it.  There is so much going on in the flavor and, unfortunately, that is darkness slight downfall.  To me, this is an example of where extreme brewing goes a bit over the line.  IF surly toned this down a bit (towards 9% alcohol) it could be a 5.  The palate is much thicker and richer than the pour would have had me guess  very little carbonation with a velvety smooth and voluminous body that lends to a very creamy mouthfeel  easy 5.  Overall: truly world-class beer that is a slow sipper, yet proves impressively drinkable  but when it gets really warm the alcohol really pulls through.  The one think that keeps lingering in the back of my mind is that this might be just a tad bit overdone and is a tad bit too sweet, but not enough to detrimentally affect its true beauty.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

Undercurrents of fruit. Rich, creamy medium body--not anywhere near as slushy as I thought it might be. Some chocolate, roast, and coffee--the usual suspects--but together theyre just one layer.

3467,"2008-10-31",4.4,"’08 Darkness (served on tap):

Pours a pitch-black, viscous liquid. Not quite as thick as ’motor oil,’ as some would suggest. The darkness gives way to a brilliant, dark-tan head. Initial, one-finger head gives way to a small ring of bubbles as the beer warms and is consumed. 

Aroma is of dark fruits, cocoa, bakers chocolate, a little bit of burnt coffee, dark roasted malts, and actually has relatively hoppy overtones (although not citrusy, west-coast hoppy). 

Mouthfeel starts off pretty thick and creamy, but finishes with a slight sensation of carbonated goodness.

Taste is of dark fruits, sweet malts, roasted coffee and malt, maraschino cherries, bitter chocolate, and even a slight bittering, tannin-like flavor. Bitterness is primarily due to the strong hop presence which shines through in the tangy flavor, as well as the lingering bitterness on the back of the palate after swallowing. 

Drinkability is relatively good, despite the thick mouthfeel and heavy malt/roasted flavor that dominates this beer. The hops add a kick that help round off and balance this huge RIS. Still a borderline sipper, though.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","bulldogp04"

Now, after standing in line with my son and his friend for 2.5 hours Saturday, I have had the opportunity to taste what undoubtedly is the best beer I have ever had the pleasure to experience.  It somehow manages to have a monster flavor, rich in malt and dark fruit, chocolate and rich, smooth coffee, and a wonderful, mystical undercurrent of hops, without any one character up staging the other.  I am thrilled that I have five more bottles to share with others.","Minnesota, USA","EHopper"

Taste is of roasted malts, burnt fruit, chocolate, oatmeal, and coffee. The huge malt taste is balanced out by a sharp hop bite. Very thick and sticky mouthfeel. The alcohol is not apparent in the taste. This is a huge beer, but highly drinkable. Definitely worth the hype.","Burbank, Illinois, USA","BeerBunker"
3467,"2008-10-25",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2009 2008 Bottle.  Poured an obsidian black with a two finger brown head.  Aroma of roasted malt, burned sugar, bitter chocolate and some coffee, with a huge hop profile in the nose.  Flavor is very complex.  Flavor of sweet malt, dark fruit with a dry hop finish.  Well balanced and the alcohol is not dominating.  Great beer, but not as good as some others Ive had.  This was kind of like a combination of an IPA and an Imperial Stout.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","nqualls"
3467,"2008-10-25",4.7,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2013 Bottle from 2008 batch pours dark with a monster tan head that clings leaving lots of lace.  The aroma is chocolate, malt, roasted sugar, and pretty decent hops.  The flavor is sweet, fruity, chocolaty, lots of dark dried fruit, prunes, with a perfectly balanced hop profile to make it all work together in an amazing way.  There is a lot of flavor and complexity, but it never tilts or leans out of balance in any particular direction.  It works and works well.  The palate is smooth, yet not as rich as with other monster brews that are sometimes too much.  This however, is a drinkable palate without becoming too much like a milk shake.  The carbonation is there, manifested in micro sized bubbles.  The alcohol is not in the flavor.  Overall, this lives up to the anticipation.  I’ve waited a long time to try this.  It is worth the hype.  Surly Darkness 2013.  This is an Imperial Stout extraordinaire.  The pour into a tulip is black, with just barely deep red hues around the edges in intense back light.  A massive head forms that takes a while to diminish to a surface mat of foam.  The aroma hits with dark dried fruit, citrus hops, coffee, chocolate, and sour cherry.  The flavor is sweet, milk chocolate, cherries, hints of some citrus, and so well balanced.  The mouth feel is velvet smooth with a bit of cleansing hop finish.  This is the Imperial Stout that sets the standard.  Truly perfect this year.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"

3467,"2008-10-14",3.9,"Bottle Number 172, 2nd RB Tucson Tasting, Sampled September 2008
This beer pours with a frothy, thick textured, light brown colored head and is quite pitch black in color.  The aroma has notes of chocolate and cocoa up front, but quickly gets to notes of dark roast and lightly acidic coffee.  It has a lightly smoky aroma to it that is almost peat like at times and there is a roast plum fruitiness to it.  This does not have as sweet / rich a malt base character to the aroma as I expected.  This has a nice grain character that takes on umami laden notes that are a touch like teriyaki, but there is also some subtle licorice and mint notes.  The roast character is definitely dominant in the nose, but there is other stuff going on that makes this quite the intriguing beer to be smelling.

As this beer first hits my tongue it feels very thick, chewy and is more sweet than the aroma suggested, but it is still roast malt dominated.  There are flavors of coffee, bitter cocoa and burnt grain bitterness that lingers on in the finish with the amply bitter hop notes.  Concentrated umami notes in the flavor of rich malt character and some notes that are picked up of a rich, savory, almost salty-smoke character as well as some flavors of burnt, dried plum.

This is subtle complex and it really grew on me as I worked my way through the beer; there is definitely lots of things going on in this beer and it is one of the better Imperial Stouts I have had in a while.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3467,"2008-10-13",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2017 Graciously shared by jtrockchalk from BA, thanks.  2007 bottle with almost a year on it.  Believe it or not it poured a black color. Aroma is chocolate-y with some light dark fruits.  Taste is some hops breaking through, but they are dead in life. Its not a fresh bottle so the hop character comes off out of place. A bit of light coffee as well. Mouthfeel was a bit too thin for such a big beer.  Basically nothing stands out much, the hops have grown weak and are out of place. Too light and no surprise that is just so overrated. 7/4/7/3/15Had a 2008 bottle, shared by theisti at Indras Strong Ale tasting.  Much fresher and I liked this a bit more.  Had a thicker overall presence, which muted and balanced the hops better.  Similarly, added to the mouthfeel.  I dont know, just less hops and more stout, so that was better. 7/4/7/4/16
2009 bottle, drank super fresh. Black body that pours with a beautiful thick brown, large head.  It fades slowly and leaves a sticky lacing.  To start, I thought I would hate  this b/c it got hoppy but I was wrong. The aroma is hoppy, which come off as fruity and earthy.  The hops work well with a cool malt bill which comes off with buckwheat and I love this aspect.  This comes out in the flavor as well and the hops linger on the back end with some bitter and citrus kick.  The hops and the cool malt bill work well together.  This is the best version of Darkness I have tried. 8/5/8/3/17

2015. Shared by my good friend Steve. Aged for about a year and a half. Black beer thick cocoa tan head surface covering lacing. Aroma is slightly syrup black malt sweetness, not super big, and not big. Earthy syrup quality as well. Flavor is even more subdued with a base of black malt syrup. Not bitter and not ""big"" but still fun. Nothing crazy but a decent improved stout. Havent had this in years but its so different every year.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Aroma is beautiful...the melding of hops and dark, chocolate and caramel malts...some slight notes of coffee and dark fruits also became evident as I took this in...I cant imagine any beer more destined to be on cask than a good imperial stout.  Flavor is also beautiful, and much better than I expected it to be.  I""m not sure what percentage of this is due to the fact this was on cask, but the hops did not overwhelm the stout characteristics...lots of chocolate, rich caramel malts, with a good dose of bittering hops to balance everything out.  I kept noting a nice dark fruit accent lying in the background which was just amazing.  Palate is great as well...smooth and velvety.

Rather than wait until 2:30 PM to slam it before racing off for another tapping I found this at the start in the Real Ale tent.  Since I’m not sure how that changed things I would love to sit down with a regular pint at some point to compare.  Unfortunately you don’t get that luxury at a five hour festival.

Aroma / Appearance - The deep black body had strands of lacing and a tan head that are typical of a high gravity imperial stout.  Oak, black coffee, rich truffles and raspberries meld into a balanced mixture.  Somehow still light on the senses that the hoppiness did not seem out of place I enjoyed this aroma greatly.

Flavor / Palate - The creamy full mouthfeel is just what you would expect from a world class imperial stout.  The chocolately hoppy conversion soon fills the mouth with a rich coffee like texture.  Better than the barrel aged version that was on tap last year I think this is an imperial stout best enjoyed before the hops begin to fade into the background.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

And I have to say that despite Darkness being an awesome imperial stout, it’s not even close to Dark Lord. Darkness has a very pronounced american hop aroma to it, which was really nice, but it lacked the insane amount of viscosity i was hoping for. Don’t get me wrong though, this was still pretty thick. The taste was very complex and had a good amount of hop bitterness to it to balance the malty sweetness. Overall it’s my number 2 imperial stout.","highland, Indiana, USA","inkubus27"

Great pour with a great, lasting head on this beauty.

Delicious grapefruit/citrus bitterness is still a large component of this beer, despite the bottle having some age on it.  I’ve had hoppy imperial stouts before (Rogue, Victory, etc), but none that came off so citrusy....an interesting choice and one that I find to work extremely well.  Great roast character with complementing dark chocolate and a lingering bitterness.  Light alcohol presence on the end.  Some dark fruits seem to be present as well - specifically raisins.

Huge body with medium to low carbonation - very suitable.  Rich and nicely coating.

Excellent beer.  Very unique (and this is not an easy thing to be in the RIS category) with the delicious citric hop presence.  I’d take a keg of this ;)","USA","rallison"

The roastiness and the hop flavors linger. A bit hoppy astringent as well. Full body, vibrant carbonation.","San Diego, California, USA","doubleo"
3467,"2008-07-05",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2008 2006 Version, on-tap.  Pours out completely black into its very own Darkness glass. Dark brown head that lasts throughout and leaves about an inch of lacing at the top; pretty amazing for such a big stout. Smell is predominantly hoppy. Filled with aromas of citrus with hints of coffee and cocoa hidden almost entirely behind the hops. Taste has citrus hops dominating, and there isnt much of a roasty flavor until the finish. Carbonation was medium and mouthfeel is incredibly thick, but very nice. A joy to drink, but this is more of a sipper. 

On a side note, Ive had IPAs that arent nearly as hoppy as this, and wouldnt mind getting to see the malty side of this beer that is hidden behind the hops. A very awesome beer, that would probably be better if the malt was allowed to shine a bit more. Great job Surly, this one is worth seeking out.

2008 Bottle on Halloween 2008: Black as night, tan head with excellent retention and lacing.  Smells of charcoal, molasses, caramel, dark fruit, licorice, maple, and juicy hops.

Pours deep darkness with frothy creamy and bubbly mocha head. The aroma is mild with an above average load of pine hops mixing with roasty malts, a firm background of chocolate, musty dirty wood notes and mild alcohol warming on the tip of the nose. A creamy decadent mouthfeel ushers in the same notes picked up in the aroma with pine hop bitterness, rich creamy dark chocolate, dark roasty to burnt malts and rich dark fruity esters of sweet berries and faint tart berry fruitiness.

Rubbery as hell, the full car tyre, bready, woody, roasty and toasty with some slight ethanol but god I love it. Delicate hints of pepper and sourness right at the top really make it. A stunning smell. Flavour... oh, my, GOD. Its rare these days for me to not know where to start but I really dont. Awesome balance and finesse but its still HUGE. In fact the balance is pretty much spot on. Chad prefers it with the big hops but as far as I can tell, with age this has mellowed into something that is utterly sublime. Mellow is not quite the right word as this is far from restrained. Massive thick black coffee, awesomely rich, superb chocolate with some utterly outstanding hops that leave a hardcore resinous sting on the finish making this something really really special indeed. Utterly unreal balance of sweet coffee chocolate and bitter resinous hops round it all off. The rubbery notes are the best I have experienced. The stinging, tangy, bitter aftertaste is beyond my powers of description and the gorgeous hint of sourness coupled with the prickly sting from the alcohol is just a stunning experience.

750ml bottle thanks to OSLO.  First impressions of the nose is a bit confusing: some greenish hops and celery notes, some hard roast, some chocolate syrup, and some yogurt-like yeast, but when warmer theres some wheat germ and moldy grains going on (even some musty cannibus).  First taste is very thick, very frothy, very chewy, some charred cocoa, some ashy bakers chocolate, some more greens and leaves and basil and such.  Super chalky chocolate, and thankfully the hops arent so huge in the flavor as much as they are in the nose.  Thick, viscous pancakes and oatmeal, very donut-like (the whole glazed sugar and dough and chocolate thing).  The long-lasting finish has some more of the green qualities, along with some pasty chalk and wood.  Cant say Im blown away, I think the biggest drawback is the liquid smoke-steak deal in the nose when its warmed, but for sure its a delicious imperial stout and unlike most out there.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Aroma of cocoa and malts.  Flavor is more of the same along with some coffee and maybe caramel.  Mouthfeel and body seem a little light for this style.  Cocoa finish with a hint of hops.  Not very complex as I would expect for a beer of this caliber. {6/5/6/3/14}

[30Mar09] Bottle, 2008 vintage.  Pours a pitch black body with a soapy, light brown head.  Nice aroma of grapefruit hops and dark malts.  Flavor of burnt malt, chocolate, grapefruit hops, and maybe a hint of coffee.  Medium to heavy body with an oily mouthfeel.  Bitter hop and cocoa finish.  For me, the grapefruit hops seem a little distracting for a imperial stout, imparting an odd sweetness and basically distract from what isnt a very complex flavor profile. {6/5/7/4/14}","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","zeke626"

It was utterly lacking in that soy sauce-like quality that can detract from even the best imperial stouts, which made it smooth and drinkable and yet would have to be regarded as a by-product of that lack of complexity.

WOW.  wow. wow. wow.  This became the theme of this glass.  wow.  Put a blindfold on me and I wouldnt have been able to get the color right... nose was quite interesting.  Green, floral, resiny pine hops at the forefront - Pliny?  Im confused.  Flavor screamed non-comformity.  What a concept... really a crap load of resiny pine like hops with a fat and chewy malt backbone.  This transitions into some darker, semi-sweet chocolate and bitter coffee..  this barely has a chance to shine as a different blast of grapefruity citrus hops bitter their way into the finish and decide not to leave until the next sip.  This is like an orange flavored pine cone dancing with a white chocolate covered caramel candy.  The palate really just keeps delivering - soft and soothing, proud but elegant, full bodied but highly drinkable.  This seems almost unprecidented - close your eyes and this could fly by as the greatest IIPA Ive ever had...  stands on a pedestal for flavor.  Deserves the hype without a doubt.

A huge amount of intrigue and creativity has gone into this one, and is worth extra attention. Pour is pitch black and brown edges, with a frothy milk-chocolate colored head and heavy lacing. Maroon bubbles are produced while swirling. The aroma is intensely crisp, floral and hoppy, with notes of cut grass, cocoa powder, light coconut, doughy pancake batter and a dark chocolate base. The flavors create a genre-defying experience due to the insane hop profile that was used. Each sip starts with sweet mocha, roasted wood, black malt, caramel, brown sugar and currants - immediately transitioning to a big peppery pine forest hop ending. Some coffee and caramel is noticeable, but the hops make this baby shine, with orange and grapefruit citrus notes on top of the chocolate backbone. Very balanced considering the bitterness, this really could be a huge, malty, black double IPA. Resiny hops finish with a tickling carbonated sting with the alcohol content hiding somewhere. Great body that only becomes more savory with warmth. Hot damn!........................................ version sucks; sweet and twangy with no hop character like the previous batch.

Lisalucy sat in line for five hours to procure this bottle of Darkness as a Christmas present for her (extremely proud) father (Flyer), who was nice enough to share with me and BeerBelcher.  Unfortunately, although this beer was great, and I was really glad to have tried it, it just wasnt as great as I had hoped it would be.  The top 50 is filled with huge, overwhelmingly flavorful beers, as is the imperial stout style.  But, this, by comparison, was pretty tame, which makes its #5 ranking somewhat perplexing.  The beer itself pours a pitch black with very little head and a nice bit of roasty aroma.  Roasted malt and chocolate flavors up-front and a good amount of super-sweet molasses in the finish.  Also, just a bit of soy sauce.  The mouthfeel was nice and thick, and a bit oily, but far from being as thick as Dark Lord or Alesmith Speedway Stout.  Overall, I echo BeerBelchers statement that, it reminded me of a more approachable Big Eddy RIS.  A great beer, but its overall ranking seems a bit high.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","surlysober"

Aroma is malty and surprisingly hoppy with a dominant smoky-molasses aroma.  There is also a minimal chocolate smell; like hot chocolate powder.  Flavor is a full roasty smokiness on the tip of the tongue and somewhat chocolatey across the top of my tongue.  Mouthfeel is thick and smooth; and it feels like it would coat the back of a spoon.

This beer was much more drinkable than I expected and other comparable beers like Dark Lord.  In all honesty, it tasted to me a lot like a less roasty and more approachable Leinenkugel Big Eddy RIS.

I tried several times to get a trade, but could never cut the mustard.  Many thanks Tim!  Bottle #571/480 (they sold 480. they bottled almost 600. they remaining ones theyre hanging onto for their own purposes) A superbly well made beer. Some chocolate in the aroma initially.  Initially I thought the aroma was mild, but then as it warmed up in my glass and as I had a glass with just tiny bit of liquid the aroma starts to explode with chocolate and malt and caramel and figs.  The taste is another explosion of flavor.  It wraps around your tongue imparting flavor to every bit of the top and bottom of your tongue with lots of chocolate and sweet malt.  Not barrel aged, but surprizingly mellow for a beer that has just been released.  Also surpizingly easy to drink.  Easy to get carried away sipping into blissful heaven.

On Tap:  This poured black in color with a thn dark brown head that dissipated away.  The nose gave off strong scents of chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit, coffee and chocolate covered toffee.  In the mouth it was full-bodied, dense and concentrated with enough carbonation and hops to keep it in relative balance...this just had a lot of everything.  THis was thick and rich yet I had no problem ordering and drinking a 2nd glass.  Great stuff and much better than the 2007 version which was too hoppy, especially in the finish.

3467,"2007-12-04",3.8,"GABF 2007.  Maybe the stuff they brought to the fest wasnt the best (Ernests and TARs ratings seem to be quite a bit lower, like mine, so maybe this is it).  Or maybe this is much better bottled than on tap.  If there is no excuse, though, Id have to say that this is the most overrated beer Ive seen on the site, ever.  Id like to try a bottle, just to reevaluate, because I had many samples, and could not convince myself that this was even Top-100, much less Top-10.  Large, dark oatmeal head.  Alcohol and slightly burnt toffee sweetness on the nose.  Thick and full in the mouth.  First Impressions: Roasty up front, with a nice grain presence in the finish.  Creamy texture.  Digging Deeper:  Theres something herbal and medicinal in the middle that I dont like.  Hops become aparent on the smell.  Theres a distinct and not very pleasant alcohol burn in the finish after a middle of rum chocolate (but slight; if the rum chocolate flavors were more pronounced, Id be willing to give the beer a break on the alcohol).  Overall:  seems like a much lesser version of Dark Lord.  Its trying to be that huge, impressive, over-the-top experience, but it isnt over-the-top enough.  Dark Lords size can mask some of its deficiencies.  Here, though, youre left with an imperial stout that is devoid of impressive qualities (at least in a good way).  It doesnt have the distinct, developed, full flavors that the best do, nor does it commit to the Dark Lord beat-your-senses-into-submission awesomeness either.  Not at all a bad beer, but come on.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

3467,"2007-11-28",3.5,"Draft @ GABF  numerous samples: Penetrable black with maple-brown edges. Poorly retained light-beige head. Decent but uninteresting aroma consists of grapefruit, ink, black licorice, tar, burnt custard and smoky char. Loose prickles of hard carbonation. Seductively viscous body. Astringently rubbery and sharply charred, yet somewhat juicy and explosive beneath, with grapefruit and mango intermingling with a gooey fudge undertow. High concentration of hop-derived sappiness virtually seals the lips. Roast is pungently smoky and quite earthy. Tar-soaked grapefruit and peach continually prevail over the crisp malts, but are aided by dabs of ink and licorice which add to the chewiness. Solid malt core is enormous and saturated with charcoal, plummy esters and hop oils, but sorely lacks complementary malt softness. Oily java coincides with chocolate pudding, fudge cake and bitter black chocolate. Crunchy char continues its relentless assault on the palate and somewhat compensates for the overly tacky residuals which line the finish.  Forceful char perpetually lingers alongside the equally potent hop acids and ink-soaked citrus medley. Extensive dry-hopping yields a flavorsome assortment of citric hop burps. Although the robust char makes the oppressive resins tolerable, I still find this to be far too resinous and acidic for me. Yeast character is also boring and slightly unclean. Malts are well-structured, though.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Great looking beer- black as night as expected with a chocolate milk head.  Nose is heaven- spicy roasty chocolate. Taste- waves of flavours- all the usual suspects in a great imperial stout- dark roasted coffee, dark and milk chocolate, hazlenuts; plus a wallop of hop bitterness.  The hops were really well done, and I think Im lucky to have tried this fresh while the hops are still battling out with the malts.  Adds a really nice dimension to the beer.  The pineyness of the hops plays well with the decadent desert of the malts.  Very smooth mouthfeel and absolutely no booze heat. Damn fine.

Looks like I have the honor of providing the 100th rating, which seems fitting considering I drove 7 hours this morning, (with another 7 hour drive back home tonight) just for the chance to try this beer!  Idiot? Yes. Obsessive? Yes.  Worth it? Well, lets find out.   Pour is dark black, with a full, creamy dark brown head that lingers and maintains a thinner, yet complete cap throughout; lacing is thick and almost solid all the way down the glass.  Aroma is packed with cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, vanilla, espresso, brown sugar, and some light citrus/pine hops present.  Not overpowering, but still roasty, decadent and captivating.  Flavor brings out a surprising amount of hops bitterness, which intermingles well with more bittersweet chocolate, espresso, molasses, and vanilla.  Everything comes together very nicely, centered around the hops.  Palate is full, smooth and creamy, good coating, with a lasting but mild hoppy bittersweet finish.  Overall, this is a fantastic beer, albeit ever so slightly rough around the edges.  I can only imagine a more blended, well rounded experience if this would be aged a bit to tame the hops some, but stellar none the less.","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"
3467,"2007-11-19",4.7,"On tap at Cafe 28 in Minneapolis.  Served at a cool temperature in proper glassware.  Aroma is dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, mild hops, and cream cheese.  Dark brownish black with a thick foamy head of good durations and excellent lacing.  Flavor is very rich but even.  Good flavor changes in the initial sip, pops back and forth between sweet and bitter, woody and cheesy.  Chocolate, cream cheese, caramelized sugar, cream, mild oaken flavors, and bourbon.  Flavor is complex enough.  Alcohol is not noticable.  Palate is rich and creamy but not syrupy.  Pleasant chocolate duration.  Good combination of sweet and bitter with a slight dryness on the finish. Excellent and well balanced.  Only weakness is that the aroma could be more potent.  This is one creamy beer. Very very good.","Coralville, Iowa, USA","marchcow"
3467,"2007-11-18",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2008 Tap at Small Bar- Division, Chicago (thanks to pantanap).  What a wonderful stout.  Has the smoothness of Founders Breakfast stout with maybe a little more complexity-- especially in the aftertaste.  Not quite as in-your-face and thick as Dark Lord 07.  Nice thick mouthfeel-- but not too thick.  Could drink this all afternoon as a session beer (and almost did).

Aroma: Good pine/grapefruit hop presence, malty goodness, and coffee, and a bit o chocolate. I was in love with this beer before I even tasted it, and half expected that it couldnt keep up with the standard it had already set. It did. The taste starts with delicious malts and sweetness and finishes strong with coffee and a fair amount of hops to dry it out a bit. So flavorful. The mouthfeel was phenomenal; it was like velvet in my mouth. I looked hard for a fault, but didnt come up with much. Perhaps a little more really dark malt character would have been nice? Thats just speculation.

Aroma: It seems alcohol has taken over where the hops used to be (tap version) in this beer, which is a bit disappointing. A lot of chocolate, some dark fruits, and a hint of coffee. A little buttery. Taste: A lot of chocolate (slightly chalky). Not quite as smooth as the tap version either, but still quite nice.

A lot of hype over this beer, and after all it is well worth it. Darker than hell with little head until you swirl it around a bit to create a creamy caramel foam. An aroma of vanilla, espresso, and chocolate. The taste of overwhelming velvety coffee and chocolate malts followed by an impressive hoppy essence that I have never experienced in a stout of this stature. A smooth, tingling alcoholic presence that puts me in my place after abusing my new-found freedom of Darkness at my near disposal. The mouthfeel is smooth, thick, and creamy with the drinkability of milk after 2 dozen blazing hotwings.

Fresh hop acidity and lush bitterness greets ya first and is supported by a chocolate and slight smoke finish. Also noted some twangy liquorice and sweet plum. The alcohol help cleanse the palate.  The mouth feel is aggressive and warming with a knock down dryness, astringent to some degree.

When cold, the aroma is mainly a nice mix of dark chocolate, cocoa, and some bitter grapefruit peel from the hops.  Upon warming, the aroma takes a turn with more coffee and chocolate, brown sugar, liight alcohol, and if you inhale deeply, some smoke becomes present too.  Flavor of this beer is a huge dose of dark chocolate in the mid-palate with some unidentified fruit component, which then yielded to a nice roasted malt/hop finish, with the hops winning out in the end.  Mouthfeel was incredibly thick, this is just very well done.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
3467,"2007-10-30",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2016 [On-tap at Blue Nile]  Pours black with a large dark tan head.  Aroma is chocolate and hops mainly when first poured.  As it warmed, roasted malt, brown sugar, some smoke and light alcohol became evident.  Taste is citrus hops (fairly restrained bitterness) up front, then a lot of roasted malt and chocolate.  An unidentifiable fruitiness is in there, along with a bit of alcohol.  Very, very thick.  Long finish, smooth.  The mouthfeel is amazingly thick--probably beats out HOTD Adam as the thickest that I have ever had.  This is a beer that is worth the hype. Old rating: 8/5/9/5/19=4.6I have had this many times since I last rated it, but I just havent gotten around to updating this. Unfortunately, the changes I have seen with the 2016 Darkness are not good. Most notably, the hops seem to have been dialed way back, and the palate was thinner than I remember.

Sticky pour. Jet black with  a creamy, dark khaki head. Rich, sweet flavor of malt, tobacco, leather, wet wood, chocolate and coffee.  There are a fair amount of hops lurking in the background as well. Loads and loads of flavor. Big, rich and creamy on the palate with excellent carbonation. Did not disappoint. 
11/3/2007 Tap at the Blue Nile. Lots of roasted malt. Vibrant hop profile. Coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla and alcohol. Rich, creamy and quite full bodied. 
11/17/2008 Multiple servings of 2008 on draft. Holy hops! Very green hop flavor this year. Wet, oily and resinous hops meld seamlessly with a sick amount of smooth, roasted and chocolaty malt. Incredibly thick and viscous on the tongue. A velvet reacharound as my good  buddy Mark says. Yup.. this beer is all that. 
09 Cask rating. 2009 has WAY less hops than 08. This ones all about the malt. Huge chocolate, roasty nose. The alcohol presence is a bit more pronounced this year as well. Flavor is loaded with roasty chocolaty goodness. Like an alcoholic chocolate shake. If I could give a 10 for palate I would. Absolutely the most decadent mouth feel of any beer I have ever had. Cant wait to try 09 from the tap and not cask!

2010 fresh bottle
* not quite as hoppy as previous years. though still a good dose of pine on the nose and a lingering bitterness on the finish.
* substantially better attenuated than 08 + 09. much drier lacking the syrupy/sugary sweetness of the last two batches
* a bit more char (ashy/charred wood) and less milk chocolate than 09 (perhaps due to less residual sugars?)
* i think this year will take to oak/barrel aging quite well
* cleaner and less messy than 08/09 but still falls short of fresh 06/07","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"

These aromas carried over to flavor, along with a few others Im sure my developing palette missed.

Body was sweet creamy with chocolate, coffee, vanilla, roasted malts and again an some hops that absolutely clashed with an otherwise solid beer, especially with that vaguely bitter aftertaste.

Dark, oily black color with dark tan, rough-and-tumble head, fades a bit too quickly.  Texture appears suitably thick and viscous, and the ink-like blackness consumes most of the light.  Aroma bursts with hop character-- ganja and pine, with a thick, sticky resinous profile that overwhelms the malt presence.  Fairly slight malt, all things considered, and theres a big alcohol apparency on deep inhalation that slaps the malt on its rear.  Some fudge brownie, molasses, and black cookie (hard, not chewy) creeping in.  Some of the Alpha Klaus-like leafy-minty leanings to dress the malt-- and, like with Alpha Klaus, I think its a bit much.  Flavor continues that tremendous, boldly hoppy character; albeit with a stern ballance from some slight (and unwelcome) meat-like notes.  Still some good chocolate syrup, brown sugar, and chocolate liqueur malt notes, but the scale leans heavily towards the hops.  Theres just a bit too much intensity there, although its impressive for what it is, and the craftsmanship on display here is undeniable.  Full body and long, well-balanced finish.  Its just that I tend to prefer having a dazzling display of malt flavors over a ridiculously heightened balance of hop and malt extremes in my mega-Imperial Stouts.  And that subtle meat-like flavor is something I cant shake, and cant discount.  Couldve been amazing.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

3467,"2007-02-28",4.1,"From a 12oz handbottle.  Pours a dark black color with some gentle ruby shades and a fleeting head of creamy tan.  An immensely powerful hop bouquet reaches out and grabs hold of my nostrils immediately, saturated with high alpha resins.  Not a whole lot of citrus characters present, aside from some pithy white grapefruit flesh, but pine and spruce characters abound.  After getting past the initial hops punch, some of the malts brilliance starts to shine through.  Notes of black cherry mingels with some tannicy tobacco leaf, a squeeze of molasses, and a topping of dark chocolate syrup.  Full bodied, rich, chewy mouthfeel.  This is an extreme beer, to say the least.  Extreme hops, extreme malts.  The hops keep the mouthfeel from getting too soft or sticky, but are kept from getting overly ""edgy"" at the same time.  The malt flavors are delicious, and include tones of dark chocolate, flamed raisins, and more tobacco-like leather.  While the malt characters are satisfying, the hops are really what make this beer stand out in its uniqueness.  They have the well-crafted ability to impart this great tannicy quality to the malt characters without getting harsh; in addition, the alcohol is concealed well enough to focus all attention on these two aspects of the beer.  One of the most satisfying hoppy imperial stouts Ive had.  Thanks for sharing, Chris!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
3467,"2007-02-25",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2007 Black pour falls from the bottle quickly and innocently, this deceiver opens up a sudden black crevasse inside my glass that unleashes a daunting dark tan head. The carbonated top is steadfast, the body is writhing with oils. Bold is the aroma, vigorous too. Scents of ample roastiness, rich chocolate, dark fruits, substantial anise and espresso. The flavor blows away just about every dark beer Ive tried, just crushing in its weight and intensity. Massively thick, balance with few peers. Palate is very full and refined. Finishes robust but balanced. I cannot believe this is so good, I was utterly convinced Id score this well below average(the brewery is so young; oh, the places theyll go).

Nose full of roast and espresso, backed by a load of sweetness and smoky vanilla.  Joyously redolent with aroma, I sniffed it for several minutes before drinking just to keep enjoying the experience.  Flavor is similarly wondrous, blast of smoky roasted malts, vanilla, piles of cherries and plums, woodiness, sugars, and stacks of lovely chocolate.  Just beautiful.  The palate--like drinking silken, velvety joy.  Gloriously thick, just AMAZING on the mouth.  I dont care for imperial stouts anymore, but Ill make an exception.  A great beer.

The flavor is primarily a very nice, somewhat smoky, somewhat burnt roasted malt. There are nuances of tart Michigan black cherry, cherry pit, and burnt raisin as accomplices. The alcohol content is well hidden. Nice blend of flavors, quite the delicious beer here.

3467,"2007-01-27",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2009 On tap at Cafe 28. First off, I have to say my intents were to go in 

and slam this beer. Id had enough with Imperial Stouts in the Top 50 (this 

may seem hypocritical considering my past endeavors to further a certain 

example of the style). My injurious intents would soon be quickly assuaged by 

a single glass of beer...A friend and I headed to Cafe 28, where I had called 

ahead to ensure the presence of Darkness and to get reservations. They 

anticipated my arrival with a table and a couple pours. The beer came to the 

table in a narrow chalice and it carried a luxurious finger of the most 

elegantly soapy, soft creamy dark-oak head. It was almost mahogany itself, 

gently sliding around on the top with large laces following the beer down the 

glass. The black gold itself absorb all light and possibly other objects with 

gravity, with just the slighest blood red corners. Beautiful. I put the 

chalice to my nose and was blown away by a bold, unique aroma. Its a tough 

one to finger, because it was so original and something Id not experienced. 

There were lots of reduced plums, raisins, dark cherry syrup, Ecuadorian 

estate chocolates and toasted wheat kernels. It was rather piquant and 

electrifying, with a real warming phenolic nose, but it wasnt boozy or 

chemical-like, instead a real refined almost sherry or perfume signature. 

Whatever it was, it was like no aroma Id wafted. Unfortunately, the pour was 

a little on the cold side, so the aromatics were slightly restrained and my 

the time the beer reached warmer climes, my olfactories had been saturated. On the tongue, the texture was immeadiately astounding. It was so thick and creamy, yet not sticky. Sweet, but not cloying. Smooth and drinkable, yet not watery. Warm and glowing, but not too hot. Hoppy, but was not dry and parching. Some amazing alchemical processes had occured hear. Brewing magic under the hand of a wizard had formulated a brew so prefect and desirable I couldnt believe I was drinking it. I kept muttering, ""best beer ever"" and ""damn near pefect."" The flavor cascaded with everything and Imperial Stout drinker looks for. Mounds of freshly brewed Blue Moutains dark roast, Dagoba fair-trade dark chocolate, charred oak barrel edges, italian cherry skins, tahitian vanilla beans, drops of fresh organic farm cream and italian espresso and then the dark fruits really came in. Moist rainier cherries, dried succulent wild bog cranberries, fresh rasberries from the stem, a hint of musky Thimbleberries, a cacophony of Bilberry syrup and Blueberry reduction, with a hint of sour cherries and final bit of pomegranite arils. On top of this, an electric wave of bright hops. Again, the character of the hops so unique as to be something I have a tough time likening it to. It had a real shining lime zest and gin quality. High, thin and mercurial. These bold citrus oils danced over the brewing cauldron of darker flavors, complementing and intertwining magically. Then, the longest draw of a smack I could imagine. It kept going and morphing, with roads of Marcona almonds, toasted earth, light goat cheese rind and ground oak dust. From the sauna floor rose juniper branches and hints of sea oats. The real phenomenal effect of this beer was the ethereal combination of every desirable effect. Each aspect played off of every other one in near perfect harmonic balance. The aroma was different from the flavor and the hops had great interplay and the texture was just plain perfect. It reminded me much of the great singular and touchable quality of Westy 12, with all the individualisms and character of the worlds most perfect Imperial Stout. This is the solar center paradigm shift of Imperial Stouts for me. Original rating 4.9:9/5/10/5/20","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

The best part of this beer is the flavor and palate. This is perhaps the smoothest, creamiest Imperial stout Ive ever tasted.

Pours a thick black with a brown soapy head.  The nose is strange for an impy stout, hard to pinpoint at first: coffee, espresso beans, alcohol, hops, and pine.  Lots of pine.  But it goes with it really well, not as over bearing as batch 7000.  Thick creamy full body.  I really cant get over how thick and full it is.  Currants, rasins, chocolates, milky, and roasted.  Balanced pretty well with raw/rough piney hops.  Long lasting finish of piney hops, chocolate, and bitterness. An excellent beer, the hops are just a little too raw right now, but other than that everything is strong in flavor and aroma and balanced very well.  Id love to see this aged for a year, with the hops slightly mellowed.  But even right now I see why it has attained its high rank. 8/5/9/5/18 = 4.5    Ive had this beer several times over the years thanks to Chicagos Surly connection.  Up until this past year, it has really been the hoppiest and one of the best imperial stouts I had ever tasted.  So piney hoppy bitter with roasted malts and rich chocolates.  The batch this year though, just hideous.  Same dark black color with a tan head, but immediately that nose is off.  The malts are syruppy kind of all over the place, dough caramel with this herbal pine hop thats not complementing it to well.  Thick body and then this syrruppy disaster on my tongue.  The malts are all over, extremely sweet dark fruits, chocolates, caramels, with out much roast or hop bitterness to balance.  The green grassy hops taste terrible.  Really this one is hard to finish.  Please dont let this one stay this way, fix it Surly. 7/5/6/3/13 = 3.4

On tap at the blue nile.  Thankfully Al (Pigfoot) still carries this supposedly amazing stuff which is becoming hightly sought after.  Lets see if this beer holds up to the hype its receiving.  Looks the part of an imperial stout.  Pitch black, no light is getting in here.  Its like going in a dark cave where you cant see even a few inches in front of you.  If you can reach the surface, youll only be drowning in a sea of tan bubbles.  Okay, the smell is on the hoppy side, and they almost completely take over any malt.  This should be right up this hopheads alley!  Taste is unforgetable.  High hops make this a favorite in the style.  However, chocolate, raisin, soy, and cherry malts really balance out the hoppiness and make this an extraordinary brew.  I think Ive said it before, but the hoppy aspect of this beer makes it extremely inviting.  Excellent stuff and IMO it lives up to the hype its received!  On a side note, the alcohol is barely detected.  Thanks again Al, for having this yummy elixir still available.  And thanks to Islay for keeping me company.  A true treat indeed and one you should definitely get your hands on.  Top 10, I dont know, but definitely top 25.  Surly really impresses me...I cant wait to taste their 1 year anniversary beer which comes out next.

3467,"2007-01-04",4.2,"Hand-bottled... This beer rocks!... Pitch black ale with a small, creamy, rust-colored head. Decent retention. The nose is a swirl of espresso, dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, dried plums and black cherries with lesser notes of epoxy resin, alcohol and juniper. Although the beer is loaded with malt body, the sweetness works harmoniously with the burnt, bitter notes provided by the hops and scorched malts to provide a somewhat harsh, big beer flavor that sooths and pampers the palate at the same time. Ultra full-bodied with a mouthfeel resembling a fusion of mineral oil and heavy cream. Subtle carbonation. Lengthy, lightly sweet, burnt, medium bitter finish. The alcohol dries everything out at the very end. Thanks to footbalm for generously providing the 12 oz. sample of this world class beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3467,"2007-01-03",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2014 First tasting, 1-3-07, on tap at Blue Nile in Minneapolis, 2006 edition, 12 oz. pour

<P>So my esteemed coworker, tennisjoel, comes up to me yesterday and says, ""Hey, do you want to stop by the Blue Nile tomorrow after work and try Surly Darkness before they run out?"" My response: ""Uh, yeah!""

<P>We get there, and this stuff is a mere $5.50 for 12 ounces! Heckuva deal! The bartender pours it into a Kasteelbier glass, and it looks great! It pours a gorgeous, opaque, dark brown with a small amount of sable-colored head. After the head dissipates, it looks like melted, rich, dark chocolate. The aroma is both sweet and tremendously hoppy, just as the flavor would turn out to be. Raisin and milk chocolate notes make their presence felt, like in a high-end tawny port. The powerful flavor overwhelms the aroma as one drinks, preventing the aroma from capturing a top-notch rating.

<P>The flavor is both scrumptiously sweet and boldly hoppy. Some might call it ""well-balanced,"" while others might call it ""overweight."" It reminds me of a cross between the Furious and the Bender but concentrated into a juiced up beast; its the beer equivalent of Shawne Merriman! This is unmistakably a Surly beer, and when the brewer of a beer is unmistakable to someone who has tried just three of its products, you know that brewer is doing something important. Roasted malt, sherry, and pitted fruit elements are evident in the flavor. And oh those hops! This is easily the hoppiest imperial stout I have tried, and I love it! Craft brewers of the world take note: This is how you do an impy. Load it up with hops. We can handle it. The alcohol is well masked by the astoundingly strong flavors.

<P>The finish is surprisingly bitter and the texture is almost syrupy, but in a very, very good way.  This full-bodied beer has a sharp bite. It was a challenge to imbibe all 12 ounces, but a noble and rewarding challenge that I was eager to undertake.

<P>Damn! This is a ridiculously strong, unique, memorable, and wonderful beer. It is not for the faint of heart. Is Surly Darkness really one of the best beers in the world? Uh, yeah!

<P>8/5/9/5/19  4.6

<P>Fifth tasting, 11-13-07, on tap at Cafe Twenty-Eight in Minneapolis, 2007 edition, 10 oz. pour

<P>Remarkably hoppy aroma of dark chocolate, mocha, citrus (curacao, lime), cherry, juniper, pine, chocolate-covered raisins, and fruitcake. Reminiscent in aroma of a malty gin and tonic (which sounds gross but smells great).  Pours a deep brunette with a red glow and a moderate amount of thick, even, sable-colored head with large bubbles. Produces extensive, thick, long-lasting lacing. Hops initially dominate the flavor. This years edition seems to be even hoppier than last years, which had been the hoppiest dark beer I had ever tasted. Very dry finish. As I sipped more and the beer warmed, the malt character emerged: Coffee, dark chocolate, carmel, toffee, brownies, cherry sweetness. Alcohol well masked at first, but the alcohol taste does become evident eventually. Bitter finish from both the hops and the roasted malts. Thick and molasses-like. Sticky on the lips. Unbelievably, the 2007 edition is even better than the 2006 one! When the beer is cool, its double IPA-like character stands in the forefront. The cold tones down the malts and the hops cut through. When the beer is warm, the malt complexity takes over. Its like two different beers at the different temperatures, both of them fantastic! Probably the best beer Ive ever had. I recently re-tried Barley Johns Barrel-Aged Rosies Old Ale, which I had previously considered my favorite beer. While it remains fantastic, I have to say that Darkness is even better.

<P>9/5/9/5/19  4.7

<P>Surly Darkness 2014 cask dry hopped with Simcoe and Amarillo. 10 oz. goblet. At Brooklyn Center brewery taproom release on 8-6-14. Despite being the 2014 edition, this was not aged in the High West rye whiskey barrels.

<P>Appearance: Pours dark brown with thick, smooth, foamy, even, clay-like, tan/taupe head. I watched the bubbles rise to form the head. Very cool look. Some spit-like lacing holds back the appearance from a potential 5.

<P>Aroma: Chocolate and biscuit scents. Dry and piney aroma due to the hops. Earthy, dirt-like aroma features a tar scent. Good but not great smell. Mineral-y, almost fishy smell. Almond and cashew nuttiness in the aroma. Boozy smell. Playdough and uncooked bread dough aroma.

<P>Flavor: Tarry, tart flavor. Earthy, forest-y taste. Pine resin flavor element. Hot and boozy.  Boozy, bourbon-like flavor, despite the fact that this is not barrel-aged. Its definitely quite hoppy, as is a staple for Darkness. It reminds me of Blakkr in its earthiness. Bluesier than past Darknesses. Freshly baked and perhaps lightly burnt soft pretzel taste. Tasty. Flavor becomes increasingly sugar-sweet upon multiple sips: Caramel, molasses, plum. Pencil shavings / sawdust in the finish. Vanilla flavor. Also chocolate-covered bourbon ball cookie. Sweet, dark bread taste like a cross between pumpernickel and challah from a good Jewish bakery/deli. Lemon and grapefruit tart, almost sour, notes from the hops.

<P>Palate: Silky smooth in the palate but undercarbonated. The cask is less troublesome for this great beer than it is for most, but it certainly does hold this beer back. Full body. Soft in the palate. Filling. Too soft, smooth, and undercarbonated, but the full body partially rescues the palate. Multiple sips reveal it as way too undercarbonated.

<P>Overall: Interesting. Definitely as always a great beer for contemplation. I am guessing this beer would have earned a 4.3 or 4.4 were it not held back in the aroma and palate by the cask. Its nice that the flavor is able to come through so well. Not the ideal presentation but an interesting and delicious beer. 7/4/9/3/16=>3.9","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
3467,"2007-01-02",4.1,"On tap at the Blue Nile. Thanks for the chalice from that last growler Al. Pours an impressively dark colored hue with brown lacing. Nose is chocolate and soy, and the palate is thick and rich. Theres a decided sweetness to this and a decided taste of chocolate covered cherries. It reminded me a lot of Avery Mephistoles, albeit with more subdued alcohol. Its well crafted, although very sweet and lacking much roasted flavor. Certainly Top 50 material, although likely not Top 10 forever.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
3467,"2006-12-31",3.6,"Pitch black, completely opaque, with a dark head (I really love that), though not clinging to either of two glasses we had--I would have expected more stickiness?  The aroma is very subdued.  All attempts to warm and swirl this simply couldnt get the aroma to burst the way I needed it to.  The most prominent part of the nose is the hops--it reminds me of a Rogue Impy.  The palate is the best part.  This must be as thick as any beer I can remember, except perhaps a 20 year old Hardys or something.  Syrupy, oily.  Theres a bit of sourness to the flavor and the most prominent dimension is chocolate covered cherries.  Its a fine beer, but its not to my liking.  I much prefer a) my Impys to be on the grape/port scale, b) to have more roastedness if anything, and c) to have less hops.  Too much is suppressed here, particularly in the aroma.  Most Impys are fine to drink, and this one is too, but it isnt great within its own style.  The alcohol is much suppressed, to its credit. (on tap at Blue Nile restaurant)","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
3467,"2006-12-28",4.5,"Growler thanks to Chuck. Dark motor oil pour. Frothy brown head.
Nice sweet fruity hops covered by tarry roasted malt. Quite reminiscent of a Batch 7000 or a fresh 2004 Dark Lord. Alcohol, drinking chocolate mix, piney hops, dried maple syrup, soap, some envelope glue.
Thick satisfying mouthfeel. Sweet roasty maple syrup, cloves, light fruit. Everything is thick between dark roasted sweet malts. Comparable to the Dark Lord (way better than 2006) and quite good. Great and fun to drink, but not as complex as Id like (maybe the roasty sweetness covers it)

3467,"2006-12-28",4.7,"Thanks to Chuck for saving a burning orphanage, curing cancer, and standing in line to get this beer!  The aroma is very pleasant and chocolatey.  It has a nice, pitch black color, thick body, and a nice creamy brown head.  The flavor is excellent, roasty and a definite strength, but nothing too poweful to detract from the enjoyment of the beer.  It has an excellent body and texture, thick and viscous.  Overall, this is a groin-grabbingly excellent beer.","Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, USA","LePoopie"
3467,"2006-12-28",4.6,"From a growler kindly brought down from the far North by Chuck.  Black body with a big foamy brown head that leaves good lacing on my glass.  Surprisingly hoppy nose - indistinct C-hops and chocolaty-sweet graham crackers.  The low level of carbonation should help the mouthfeel but it keeps the aroma in check.  Fantastic mouthfeel - creamy, mouth coating, and viscous.  Lip-smacking goodness!  This beer falls into the hoppy imperial stout category.  Tasty and strong dark chocolate dominates with coffee char around the edges - grapefruit and lime rind zest float on top.  Resinous hops and coffee bean char lingers in the finish.  This score feels too high in comparison to my other ratings but the numbers by themselves seem OK.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
3467,"2006-12-28",4.8,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2006 Thanks Chuck for being second in line on this release on 12/23 and acquiring a full growler.  The beer pours to a pitch black beer with a nice thick dark brown head and lots of slow reverse carbonation.  Spotty lacing in some glasses and excellent lacing in others.  The aroma is huge and laden with lots of chocolate and bright grapefruit and lemon hops.  The palate is insanely creamy and rich.  Extremely full bodied.  I want to give an 8 on palate...  The flavor is extremely malty with lots of chocolate, creamy chocolate silk pie, nice bright citrus hops.  Freaking phenomenal.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
3467,"2006-12-28",4.6,"Jet black pour w/ a huge dense well laced creme of wheat looking brown head.  A well hopped aroma in an IS, a big strong malt aroma lots of carmels and grass hints of citrus even some noats of oak light alcohol and soem fruits possibly uderripe green apple and a light touch of vanilla.  Big fluffy well coated mouth feel with a nice creamy finish.  Flavor is well roasted malts a good amount of carmel and a lot of hop grasses and citrusses come through cleanly and strongly, very odd for an IS but a nice twist on the style.  After that there is some more roaste notes then a hint of vanilla and a hint of a fruit I cant quite pick out.  Very good stuff.

Note... Im contrasting this in my head to darklord and its definatelly a better brew today.  I would have to do a side by side w/ an 04 vintage DL to be fair to taht though.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
3467,"2006-12-02",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2010 First Rating, 12/2/06:  I managed to sneak over to the Blue Nile to snag a glass before its all gone.  Pours pitch black with a nice medium tan head.  Strong aroma of hops and oak, even though Im quite sure this is not a barrel aged brew.  The taste is not what I expected at all: a huge hit of dry, roasted malt thats layered with tons of piney American hops and more than a subtle hint of citrus.  The alcohol is beyond well hidden.  Nice thick feel to it as well.  My only gripe is based on personal taste.  I like my Imperial Stouts to exemplify the next level of ""stouthood"", meaning it should be ramping up what a ""normal"" stout is like.  In this case, the hop varieties used are a huge turn off for me.  It almost makes it like an incredibely darkened IIPA with a bit more burnt malt in it.  Its not that its bad by any stretch, its just not something I would enjoy a lot of.  If youre a big fan of Dark Lord, youll love this.  7-5-7-3-16 3.8

Second Rating, RBSG 2007, 2006 Vintage:  I feel I can justifiably bump this up several notches now.  The hops that I disliked the first time around are still there, but much more subdued.  The pine taste/aroma is still there a bit, but the citrus is gone.  It somehow seems thicker and more oily this time around, which deserves a bump in palate.  Big difference, though still not my end-all-be-all.  Ill be curious to try this again when its re-released.  8-5-7-4-18 4.2

Third Rating, 3/7/10, 2009 Vintage, Bottled:  Havent had this in a while.  Pitch black with a medium head.  Aroma of soy sauce, strong roasted barley, dark fruit and light pine hops.  Big fruit flavors, like plum and raisin.  Strong, bombastic malt and roasted barley.  Rummy.  Very light pine hops.  Much more like a year-old bottle already.  From what others had said, this years was very hoppy and it seems to have fadded a lot quickly.  Huzzah!  7-5-9-4-18 4.3","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
3467,"2006-11-27",4.6,"Very, very dark and opaque to the eye as it is poured from the tap. Develops a dense, dark tan head, which is very pleasing to the eye. The head along with the lace (""the stickiest of the icky"") rings the glass and never seems to let go. The hops are definitely present in the nose, but are blanketed by notes of fruit (ripening plums, Concord grapes) and mild-yet-pungent yeast. Just a touch of lactic sourness on first sip, alongside hop bitterness, notes of green apple and iodine. A rich, smooth, oatmeal stout-like quality pervades the mouthfeel, and carbonation is appropriate for the style. The yeast character remains consistent as this warms, and both vegetal and medicinal qualities are present as well.  The alcohol is boozy and warming yet unobtrusive, and the hops are biting yet not overly assertive, and are woven intricately into the aromatics. Malt-driven and full-bodied, yet by no means is this sweet in the cloying sense. Near the end of the glass (and as near to actual room temperature as I can get without busting out my handy thermometer) Im getting cocoa, vanilla, and a touch of sour cherry. Final thoughts: while the alcohol is stated to be 9.5% ABV, it is extremely well hidden here and Darkness drinks a little bit ""lighter"" than a beer going nose to nose with 10%. A complex and very well realized brew, definitely a sipper: if I get the chance to do so, Id like to try this neck and neck with the Le Coq some day, as it brings to mind some fond memories and notes of comparison to that brew.  Many thanks to Pigfoot for his grace and hospitality whilst sampling thisfine offering!","Minnesota, USA","beerpunk1969"
3467,"2006-11-26",4.7,"An unexpected treat at McKenzies bar before a concert...it came in an odd tulip glass coloured black as night. There was a thick topping of brown filling the top. This really reminded me of a 2 year old Expedition stout I once had. The aroma was filled with chocolate and a hint of burbon. In fact, the head on this had the same soapy effect that the burbon dark lord had. Thick and creamy perfect 5 mouthfeeel. The flavour is great, filled with hints of cherries, lots of chocolate, some caramel, and an interestng black licorice appearance. This is a very luscious and drinkable big stout.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"

The aroma is that of bourbon, chocolate, dried raisens, and a hint of vanilla.  The flavor is fantastic with that thick port like profile of dried raisens chocolate, vanilla, a hint of caramel and an explosion of fig prune and toffee followed by an unbelievable hop profile.  This is a great balance between hops and malt.  The palate lingers for forever, mostly due to the hops, but the cocoa and toffe/caramel stick as well.  This is a great brew, and it is even better because it is local.

3467,"2006-11-20",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2012 Snifter at Barley Johns.  A thick, opaque, black brew topped with a decadent chocolate mousse head, wafting the most intoxicating aromas of red apple, cranberry, bourbon, chocolate covered cherries, and pine.  Inhaling it is almost dessert enough for me, until that first sip coats my throat with more bourbon, some maple, irish cream, and a juicy rack of lamb, finishing with a quiet rush of bitterness, like the fog of night tucking me in to sleep.  This is certainly a monster of a beer, but it is by far one of the most graceful imperial stouts ive had.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
3467,"2006-11-06",4.8,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2006 on tap acadia cafe. beautiful billowy cocoa head atop onyx tinted liquid. aroma is of sweet, candied fruit and chocolate covered orange rind. explosive hop taste is perfectly integrated into a fantastic dark chocalate malt with just enough thickness. the hops on this are perfect (simcoe?). better than storm king, better than both yetis, better than expedition? im not willing to say that based on one glass- but the question must be asked. the hop profile is like the dreadnaught and the malt profile is somewhere between kzoo and expedition. OMAR: THIS MUST BE CANNED IT IS ABSOLUTE GENIUS.
RE-RATE 12-06 Had lunch and dinner at cafe 28 in order to enjoy this rare treat before it ran out. I bumped it up a notch for being everything I love in a stout- thick, rich, complex dark chocolate anc coffee with ample sweet and fragrant hop. For a huge beer it is endlessly drinkable and not too heavy. My favorite stout and possibly my favorite beer.","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"
3467,"2006-10-31",4.7,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2006 My Darkness sits in a Duvel tulip glass, the roasty brown espresso-tinged head filling the top, and the actual beer as black as the darkest night, saturated with sin. Tannish lace stays long on the glass. This bleak cast may scare away the timid, those less ready to tango with the Stygian side, but the nose entices me in, and am undaunted as I step into the dark.

A blast of coffee hits first, married with copious cocoa, bitter and sweet stand side by side, neither in dominance. Hints of dark rum, molasses, black pepper and anise are mixed in this aroma of this heady brew, and it only gets richer the more you drink it in the nose. Sweeter elements eventually take charge, but its still a deep, almost spicy blend.

To taste: Massive mouthfeel, thick, gooey, and absolutely delicious. Choclate is in full force, but matche once more with earthier aspects, the coffee, the spice, the slick black strap. Incredibly pervasive on the palate, this stout commands every inch of the senses, sending tasty tendrils up in each crack in the cavern of the mouth. Plenty of hops at play (80 IBUs), bobbing just below the malt.

Sip, gulp, swallow, and the parade of flavors begins again, dancing along the tongue, like some malific ballet. Dark fruit sensations rise up and leave the mind searching for the connection. Dark cherries, berries, rapberry? ....but completely covered in a shell of chocolate. The lip smacks, the tongue scrapes up remnants of this rich elixir, not to miss a drop of deliciousness. 

To state ""full-bodied"" would be an act of redundancy. This is huge, long, and out of the ordinary. Ends smooth and dryly, a pleasing finish, still loaded with flavor, never dying away completely. 

Puts many a RIS to shame, though Id love to sit down and do a comparison among others. To the great credit of Darkness, the alcohol content does not really stick out until nearing glasses end, and the less attractive aspect is that the beautiful dark, rich flavor leaves you craving more, ...although you probably shouldnt. (Its 9.5%, give or take.)

I entered the heart of Darkness, and peered into the abyss...found it satisfactory to my soul, and I believe I will take this midnight ride again and again...in moderation...

and to think, there is a bourbon barrel version on its way...oh, sweet mercy!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
3467,"2006-10-29",4.3,"Dark pruney brown. Thickly puffed and creamy milk chocolate browned topping that stays for a good stint. After a time, a sandy skim is remaining with a firm collaring and thinnly placed sheets of lace coats the glass with immense sticking power. 

Aroma is a lofty yet mild with an array of sweet dark fruity skins and juices of plum, pineapple, banana, and fig, all mixing with a dollup of chocolate cake and frosting. Ethanolic heat gets in the way as it sits and becomes the everstanding presense after a while.

Taste is a brigade of sweet, dark flavors; at first, as this Imp. Stout changes its way some as it goes. But this has a tropical, yet dark, sweet front side that has a good slice of dullish pineapple, some slimming banana, dried plums and figs, and a scant of spicey molasses. Then chocolate comes in and covers it all up with one creamy cake filling smoothness and slight bitterness. The palate is soothed over with a delightful stand of bold chocolate tone in a fluff of dark cocoa bitterness. Slight hints to the spice and fruits lingering in the corners. A mighty nice taster of a stout. The front part starts bright and tropical, but fades as it warms. This was served pretty darned chilly for an Impy, but patience pays off by letting it sit about 10, 15 minutes.

Feel is smoothly silken and thickly set in a grand tone of wonderfully delightful chocolate malt and brief, slippery Doppelbock dark fruityness. Firm and strong with only a slight hint to higher ABV type warmth thats not really evident in any fashion other then the aroma. It reminded my of a chocolate silk pie. Kinda fluffy with that certain texture thats melting and coating. Quite nice. The finish is lengthy in chocolate tone and blended well in dark set bitterness.

Surly have done themselves well with this treat. A true winter sipper that can be enjoyed fully and with more in mind once the glass has emptied.

3467,"2006-10-25",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 28, 2006 Sampled draught at the Autumn Brew Review in Minneapolis, October 7 2006.  Thick, lasting dark caramel foam leaves chunky lacing atop the completely opaque (even in the bright sun outdoors) body....the nose is certainly one of the hoppiest and most pungent of fragrances that Ive experienced in an IS, loads of wet, citric and resinous PNW hops that really dominate for a spell, though touches of bitter chocolate and anise and perhaps faint brown sugar swirls eventually show up to remind you that yes, this is a stout, whew....and amazingly, the palate is even more impressive, gorgeous silky-smooth cascades of, well perhaps Cascades, citric acids melding lovingly with intense cocoa and rustic molasses, touches of tarragon and peppers, rich and just a bit yeasty with a lovely, lasting and lingering finishing burning....easily the star of the show and the best new Imperial stout Ive had in close to two years.
