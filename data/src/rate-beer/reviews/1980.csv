1980,"2017-04-07",3.9,"I went Skiing a couple of weeks ago in Wyoming and thus I had to try the local beers. This was one that I really liked. Zonker Stout. Very popular in the region and I can see why. Good lacing, nice head that slowly disappears, not overpowering but very tasty, a solid stout. I had it my first day in Jackson Hole and had it every day while there. I also brought six back in my luggage to enjoy when I got home.

If you are in Wyoming, give this one a try!!!","Georgia, USA","jeffman52"

1980,"2016-09-12",3.6,"Aroma is first and foremost roasted coffee, with some chocolate also. The hops are prominent enough to provide some balance with a fairly generalized bitterness.

The color is black with a small to average light brown head.

This is a somewhat sweet beer which I think works well with the roasted coffee and chocolate. The bitterness is rather generalized (at least as far as I can tell) but is pronounced enough to nicely balance the malt.

The body is medium to full, a bit more on the full side. The texture is oily/creamy; the carbonation average and the finish is long with the roasted coffee, some caramel and chocolate and ending with the bitterness.

Overall I like this beer quite a bit. The sweetness works real well with the roasted coffee and chocolate and the bitterness provides a nice balance.","Michigan, USA","smroush"
1980,"2016-09-11",4.0,"Can, thanks Russ! Rich, roasted barley aroma with notes of chocolate and coffee. Pours dark brown, almost black, with a large light brown head that has excellent retention but very little lacing. Starts with roasted barley dominating the palate with a little bit of chocolate sweetness.

1980,"2015-06-09",4.4,"The Foreign Stout is an underrated and seemingly forgotten sub-genre in the stout world. Youd think theyd be more popular since beers of the style tend to be plenty robust and complex but without the massive booziness of an imperial stout. Thats exactly what Snake River Zonker Stout is and exactly why its an excellent brew.

I poured a 12oz can into a goblet. There was no freshness date and it cost $3.40 ($0.28 per ounce).

Appearance: Deep black hue with slight brown highlights. Pours to a large, dark tan, frothy head which laces and retains tremendously well.

Smell: Chocolate syrup and black licorice although a dank, piney hop aroma is present too.

Taste: If I were to describe the beers palette without any other context you might think I was talking about a huge hefty stout, but this beer is actually more middle-of-the-road. Strong bitterness right away  similar to black coffee. Immediately it becomes sweet with a delectable flavor of black licorice and dark chocolate. The hops bite back on the finish with a noticeable bitterness, though theyre much danker this time. It really complements the dark malty character. Overall, its a tasty and well-balanced brew; Im really impressed.

Drinkability: At 6% ABV, Snake River Zonker Stout is definitely not a weak beer, yet much too light to be considered imperial by any means. Im impressed it has so much flavor and complexity for this weight and is also remarkably pleasing to drink. The mouthfeel is smooth and soft, but in no way thick or sticky. I get no alcohol taste or warming sensation, though the hops do linger momentarily. This is strong enough to stand up to a savory dinner and sweet enough to complement a dessert. Drink it as you see fit.

Its full-bodied, soft, dry and almost stingingly roasted on the palate. Dark chocolate, roasted malts, coffee and a hint of soy sauce in the flavor. Lasting roasted finish. Burnt too.

Thank you, Fiona for the can.This was poured into a nonic.
The appearance was a dark brown to black color with a nice looking semi-dark tan head that really took its time dissipating. In the wake, theres a nice semi-thick coating of lace.
The smell was full of roasted coffee bean amplified by a deep dark roasted chocolate malt coming forth like milk chocolate.
The taste took those previously mentioned flavors to town to let in a fury of roast and bitter. As it continued to warm, sweet chocolate invades yet balances very nicely.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a good sipping quality about it. The carbonation was smooth. This one really ramped up a nice rolling sweet bitter roastiness coating my tongue.

The beer appears a near black shade in the body, with a dark brown hue near the crest. The beige head is a finger thick, and leaves a good trail of lacing on the glass.

Beer pours dark brown with a good off-white head. Moderate amount of lacing and a thin collar throughout. The nose is roasty and dry with some coffee notes and a bit of dry chocolate. Taste is an improvement from there, with the roast, coffee, and chocolate notes all bringing dryness but not taking it over the edge. The fact that it gets a 4.5 here is all the more impressive given that someone mentioned Two Girls One Cup while we were drinking this. Finish is dry after a medium-bodied beer. Nice and drinkable; glad we ordered this.

1980,"2010-08-22",3.6,"A vigorous pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a deeply browned, pale cocoa colored head.  The beer is a near jet black color that doesnt allow any light to pass through its depths.  The aroma smells nicely of richly toasted whole grain, lightly of dark coffee notes and amply roasted malt are all quite noticeable.  A touch of roast grain chalkiness finds its way in towards the end of the nose and some alcohol notes produce hints of Bourbon somehow.  This is a pretty straight forward roast smelling nose, there doesnt seem to be much in the way of dark sweet malt character based on the nose and in fact reminds me of a super roasty Irish Dry Stout (well see if the taste bears that out).

Dry and roasted tasting, burnt grain notes linger on the palate after my first sip and make this finish even drier.  Quite smooth tasting, but also very light bodied, this beer is quite quaffable; it is extremely light bodied in fact and definitely much like Guinness in body, though it has worlds more flavor than that beer.  Flavors of darkly roasted coffee, roasted whole grain bread crust, unsweetened cocoa powder and some roasted grain husk flavors.  There is a touch of burnt acidity to the finish, but only a touch; despite the ample roast character this manages to not be overdone at all.

This is a nice, simply focused stout; it showcases dry, roasted grain flavors without getting too harsh, too bitter, burntly acidic, or astringent.  Very nicely done, I could see myself quaffing a few pints of this beer quite easily.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

1980,"2009-10-20",3.6,"12 oz bottle purchased at Blue Max in Burnsville, Minnesota. Best enjoyed by July notched on the label. Based on the presence of some hops, I assume this is 2010?

Taste is big or the char roastiness to start, followed by burnt espresso and finishing with a mild cane sugar sweetness. Pine hops come into it mid taste and help finish it out with some nice bitterness. Finish is lasting and a bit on the milky / leafy side. Weird combo, but works for this beer. Palate is medium thin, a bit watery for the big roast taste, but it does make this easy drinking.

Thanks to Santa for sending this a few weeks ago.  I now can not only cross Wyoming off my list of states I can also say I have tried one of the best foreign stouts.  The style percentage may not bear it out but in my mind this is almost on par with most imperial stouts.

Aroma / Appearance - Deep black and almost oily it slinks out of the bottle.  As it settles into the glass a creamy beige head begins to accumulate.  The smell of dark bitter chocolate, black coffee, and anise chokes the senses to the point that this has better aroma than a poorly done imperial stout and might even hold its own against some of the better ones.

Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel backs up the advertised experience.  Creamy and filling the taste of anise, black coffee, and bakers chocolate forms a memorable profile.  A woody aftertaste sticks to the back of the throat.  Well balanced this is among the best stouts available on the market.  I would put it in my personal Top 20 of non big beers.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1980,"2008-06-09",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 14, 2008 This beer comes with the a nearby stores heaping praise.  In fact, the young clerk that pointed it out when I asked for recommendations pointed at it without a moments hesitation.  Profound!  Will the beer match the clerks reverence?  His devotion?  The Zonker Stout is totally black on the pour, in or out of the light, with a thin espresso cream colored head.  This lacing, as the beer is slowly sipped, keeps a sturdy grip on the glass.  Good strong lacing for a good strong beer.  The smell is rich and floral, most familiar with a front of raw and unground coffee beans - smooth and pleasing, even to someone that would rather take a cup of tea than coffee.  The malt flavor is, obviously, very heavy handed here, but not excessively so.  Some beers have malts that seem to discipline the drinker, giving him a slap here and there, but this is appropriately balanced.  An inflating bubble of dark chocolate stretches and squirms to make a stand, but the malt keeps it from popping onto the palate.  The aroma also has a wet, thick consistency like wet paint.  The flavor takes a different tack, initiation with coffee and fig flavors for a blend of dark, bitter and sweet, but has a clear bias for the coffee flavors.  The end of the sip contains a slithering river of dark chocolate that immediately bites the back of the throat, calling out for cold milk to free it from your esophagal tissue.  I find the Zonker stout to be more bitter than most stouts, especially since the aftertaste is so grounded in dark, high % dark chocolate flavors.  The palate is flimsy and light bodied, though, which is a bit strange considering the otherwise hulky sides of this beer.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Got this as an extra from the tremendous trader known as BitterBill, thanks Bill. Zonker Stout pours midnight black and the only highlights appear when its directly backlit. The tan head rose to two fingers as I poured. As the head eventually settled to a thick crown it left sticky drink lines on its way down. Good looking stout.

The smell on this beer is definately inviting. Roastiness starts things off and are quickly accompanied by bittersweet chocolate, cream, and cocoa. The roastiness takes the biggest piece of the aroma. Although chocolate makes a strong showing toward the backend. The aroma just pulls you in.

The flavor runs the same gamut as the aroma. The roastiness is present and takes center stage but the lactic creaminess and cocoa show themselves with authority. Pure unadulterated bittersweet chocolate rounds things off on the swallow leaving the sweet followed by the bitterness. A really nice stout.

Medium bodied with a small but perfect amount of chewiness. A roasty bitterness on the finish. This beer glides through the mouth at its own pace letting the myriad of flavors come through.

This is a very easy stout to put away. If i could buy this locally it would be a mainstay in the fridge but unfortunately this is my only bottle and its just about gone.

Zonker Stout is one of the better American stouts Ive had in awhile. Id like to try more offerings from Snake River. If theyre half as good as Zonker theyd be quality.

Taste is slightly astringent at first, like a porter would be, but that is quickly stopped by a strong wallop of chocolates, mild South American coffees, caramel, toffee and toast.  Tastes a little milky on the throat followed by a significant roast coffee tastes, and bitter roasted hop flavor.  Some say this is watery, which I wont argue as its a little thin.  But its wonderfully creamy and very smooth to the point where Im not even worried about the body.  This is just a great stout!","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

1980,"2007-01-19",3.9,"Bottle. Courtesy of stoutlover72. Thanks, Garrett, for my first Wyoming beer (and 10th Foreign Stout)! Jet black pour. Sturdy dark brown froth on the surface. Nose is roasty malts, cacao, light lactic notes, and dark choco notes. Taste is sweet with milk chocolate, roasted malts, faint coffee, light lactic tartness, and subtle hops. Body is light-medium and creamy in spots. Some dryness towards the finish and a bit of lactic tartness and astringency. Finishes with more chocolate, light lactic notes, roasted malts, and creamed coffee. Delicious!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
1980,"2007-01-06",3.3,"12oz btl. Black pour with brown edging, two finger tan head, fades out light a dying star, very slowly - then suddenly its just gone. Lacing left behind is in fair quantity though, like wheat malt that springs forth at the first sign of oxygen. Aroma is of light malts of the chocolate and lightly roasted variety, along with fresh skim milk. Flavor is similar, but with an addition of musty old hops that  show their face towards the finale, finishing with a touch of sweetened creamer and chocolatey malts, some roastiness. Balanced, decent.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
1980,"2006-12-31",3.5,"12-oz. bottle.  Pours opaque with a small quickly diminishing light brown head, fair lacing.  Aroma is heavy malt (roasted, toast, caramel), light hops (grass), average yeast (dough, leather) with notes of tar, charcoal, dark rich chocolate and heavy roasted coffee.  Average duration, moderate sweetness, light acidity and bitterness; heavy roasted straw, toasted meal malt flavor accentuated by coffee, chocolate and caramel.  Full bodied, slick texture, soft carbonation and a bitter finish.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
1980,"2006-11-20",3.9,"Just about black with large foamy brown head.  Aroma is dark chocolate and roasted malt.  Flavor is mostly semi-sweet cocoa.

Full body, smoth on the palate.  Overall this is a well balanced brew with a very roasty and robust flavor. --  I just happened to find this beer on the singles shelf.  It was the last one and I didnt see any six packs.  Too bad, this is a really nice brew (especially at this price!).

Flavor is completely different from nose; starts sweet, malt and cocoa, then an onslaught on rich roast, followed by coffee and dark chocolate.  Hop bitterness is moderate with some hop earthiness.  Palate dries out as the flavor progresses with a medium body, but a mouthfeel that feels fuller due to the soft carb. and round.almost chewy texture.

Full roasty aroma has strong coffee and and chocolate notes. Deep black body with a long lasting two finger thick mocha head. Its a looker. Fore is almost salty and quite bitter with roasted notes. Chocolate is not present, but stiff coffee is abundant. The bitterness is big, but being from the roast it incorporates well into the beer and gives it a wetness you dont get with predominately hop bitterness.

Light and fluffy aroma. The flavor is medium bodied with a nice helping of carbonation and a surprisingly active level of hoppiness in the finish. Dry with a slight tingle of malty chocolate and grainyness in the finish. I also pick up a hint of that lactose again toward the finish, but overall this is very well executed.

Still have never had a good sample, despite it winning awards periodically and getting some high ratings on occasion here as well.  I dont see it.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1980,"2002-06-13",3.9,"Dark and interesting.  Warm coffee aroma.  It has a thin feel to it though.  I mean, it tastes really good - but for as dark as it is and that nice warm aroma, it tastes thin - if that is possible.  With most beers this dark, I feel like I am drinking a milkshake - but this was thin - not unpleasantly so - it is just a strange observation.","Lewis Center, Ohio, USA","bluemeow76"
1980,"2002-06-12",4.0,"Pours like a glass o road tar. In other words, its very dark. Thin and quickly diminishing head. Satisfying coffee/roasted barley aroma, and a nice hops/malt balance made for good drinking. Glad I got a sixer of this.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
1980,"2002-06-07",3.7,"Somebody send Oakes another bottle.  Its not a world beater, but its not a bleh either.  Nicely roasted, sweeter malt with some cloying cherry, but mostly interesting  molasses.  It has some rougher edges to be sure - some from hops, some from the challenging carbonation.  Id say it gets the nod over Moose Juice, the other Jackson Hole stout.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
1980,"2002-04-22",2.3,"Almost non-existant aroma.  Slight notes of roasted malt and coffee I really had to struggle to discern.  Flavor profile is not much better.  Not watery, just not many exceptional flavors.  Some roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and slight smoke but I had to struggle to find them.  Bitter finish.  Black as night with a large milk chocolate colored head I found appealing.  Altogether, not a stout Im eager to try again.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"
1980,"2002-03-21",3.9,"Very dark beer with nice, dark head.  Initial flavor is roasty/coffee balanced with alot of hops.  As it warms the alcoholic notes come out in the finish.  This is a good stout with all the right flavors, if maybe a little less complex than my favorite stouts.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
1980,"2002-03-16",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2006 Jet black colour.  Rocky head.  Very attractive stout.  Chocolatey, slightly lactic, a bit roasty aroma.  Distinctly chocolatey flavour with delicious sweet maltiness.  This combination of complexity and drinkability is rare.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

1980,"2002-02-10",4.2,"My god, this beer is blacker than the dark side of the moon! Creamy dark tan head. Chocolate nose. Soft and smooth on the palate. Roasty & toasty, with some coffee tones and some dark-chocolate sweetness. I dont see it as being watery. Sometimes a soft mouthfeel might be misinterpreted as watery, but the flavor is fairly robust. Bitter - almost sour - finish, which lasts... and I liked it. Maybe a little acrid, but I like em like that; call me weird.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

1980,"2002-01-01",4.2,"A very good stout.  All kinds of different roasty and nutty flavors.  The color was opaque and the mouthfeel was thick but incredibly smooth.  Rung in 2002 with this gem thanks to Gusler!","Acworth, Georgia, USA","billb"

I get this one all the time. Snake River does have
some fine brews...I do miss the Draft Lager that was
around a couple of years ago.","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"
1980,"2001-11-24",3.6,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2007 Penetrable black. Sticky burnt-pearl foam leaves chunky lace all the way down the glass.  Expressive orange-infused chocolate and salted licorice aromatics. Slightly phenolic. Firm carbonation expands on the palate. Dryly grainy upfront with an assertive blend of bitter cocoa and pungently earthy roast which bolsters the dryness. Fluffy nougat pillars the center, but some graininess exudes beneath.  Plummy fruitiness echoes that of the acidic char.  Buttery caramel softens the graininess and adds depth. Brash whispers of hop bitterness waver in and out. Flaked barley imparts a pleasant oily java effect before finishing slightly tarry, but mostly dry and light on its feet with crunchy char, smoke, and java. A bit grainy and not quite soft or elegant enough, but an enjoyable stout nonetheless.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1980,"2001-11-03",4.2,"A nice, heavy stout.  Not very think (a bit watery).  A small hop profile.  Very enjoyable.","Laramie, Wyoming, USA","Dragon99"
