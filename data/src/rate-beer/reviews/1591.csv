1591,"2017-02-12",3.3,"Bottle. Pours milky white, and leaves a film on the glass. The nose is banana esters, overripe apples, sheetrock, dry rice, and rubbing alcohol. Sweet and boozy. Light body, with a creamy, smooth, and velvety texture. This is a fun and tasty sake. I dont know much about sake, but it was enjoyable and went well with our curry.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"
1591,"2017-01-21",3.5,"Milky white. Big rice and alcohol in the nose. Flavors a rich sweet rice and medium alcohol noticed. Love the sweetness. There is however a lot of extra sediment or to much at the bottom.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","MrBeerFanatic"

1591,"2016-07-13",3.7,"Prior to shaking the bottle, there is s light sense of alcohol and it is sweet. At 50F it is smooth and creamy with no alcohol burn what-so-ever...A thickness remains on the tongue after a sip. The flavor is like milk, soft fruit, and a mild sense of alcohol. At room temp, At warm 105, the alcohol becomes more apparent yet it is still velvety smooth. At hot, the alcohol becomes even more prominent. My preference was definitely chilled. where the smoothness was maximized and the alcohol minimized. The flavor contains a notable rice quality.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1591,"2016-05-25",4.1,"Bottle. Pineapple, coconut, rice, and yeast aroma - very nice. Opaque white. Moderately sweet tropical fruit, rice, and mildly bitter grass flavor. Moderately strong bitter alcohol flavor. Excellent.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"

1591,"2016-02-15",4.0,"Bottle... This sake rocks! A skim-milk pour with loads of white silt left on the glass after a swirl or two. The aromatic highlights are coconut milk and some really nice floral notes. Also, plenty of ethanol here. Full-bodied with a grainy mouthfeel and no carbonation. Sweet, boozy, Piña Colada flavor. A sipper for sure. Sweet, warming, coconut milk finish. World-class sake!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

1591,"2013-05-03",2.2,"Bottle at Maru in Cary, NC. Pours a very thick and creamy off-white color that almost seemed to have the consistency of a thin chowder. Nose had a lot of dry white wine elements to it. The taste, though, was a little sweet with just a hint of the wine notes. Very creamy.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
1591,"2013-04-21",2.0,"375 mL bottle from SoHo Organic Market, Elizabeth City, NC.  Has the appearance of watery milk once the yeast mixes in.  Aroma of light citrus and yeast.  Lightly sweet flavor of coconut and alcohol.  Im not sure that I should be rating sake but if this is a great example I am pretty sure it is not my thing.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","zizzybalubba"

1591,"2013-01-24",3.4,"Bottle @ a restaurant.  Shake before opening.  Pours a soft cloudy white color.  Aroma is slight (served chilled).  Taste is almost sweet, complex through the palate.  A little chalky.  Palate is soft at the beginning, and grows stronger.  Aftertaste is somewhat alcoholic.  A better sake than Im used to.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Caytinator"
1591,"2013-01-12",2.8,"The aroma has notes of fruity sweetness, grain and alcohol. Pours a cloudy milky color. The taste is primarily sweet. Fruit, (plums?) sugar, vanilla. The flavor was more pronounced than what I expected from the nose. Creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a pleasant reaction to my first experience with sake.","Fischer, Texas, USA","Beerenberger"

1591,"2012-09-17",3.7,"Not sure why the low ratings on this or if I was just in great mood heading into vacation but had this at JFK airport before heading off to AZ.  Pours very white slightly thick and nice tropical fruit nose.  tastes of melon, coconut, chalk, rice, and light alcohol.  very creamy and refreshing.","New York, USA","Jow"

1591,"2011-08-21",3.0,"375ml bottle at Koto in Eastgate, for $10, shared with my mom. The waiter told us the manager shook it in the back before bringing it to our table, and it was served cold. The color looks exactly like eggnog, maybe not quite as thick-looking though. This is my first-ever sake, though, so Ive got nothing to compare this to. Im not sure what sake is supposed to look like. It has a nice creamy rice aroma, and a minimal alcohol taste/warmth for the high ABV. Kinda an acidic texture to the aftertaste, however. Overall, not bad, especially considering that this was the cheapest bottle on the menu. M: ""Like coconut.""","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
1591,"2011-04-16",3.7,"375 ml bottle.  Shook the bottle before serving.  Pours a milky white.  Taste is of rice, fruit.  Similar aroma.  Is on the sweet side, but not overly.  No alcohol detected.  Has decent body and is pretty smooth for being unfiltered.  Exceptionally easy to drink and really enjoyable.  Well worth picking up again.","Lander, Wyoming, USA","scooterbub"
1591,"2011-02-12",4.7,"Excellent. I only had four little cups of this Nigori Sake, but I can guarantee it is the best I have had yet. It was very milky, almost solid white. Unfiltered, oh yes. And it was rich, smooth, barely a hint of alcohol. Excellent.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","bpreo"

1591,"2009-03-16",3.1,"Pours a thin skim milk white.  Aroma is slightly sweet but not much.  Taste is nice sweet rice and fruit, melons up front.  The back end is alcoholic burn.","Capital of Appalachia, Pennsylvania, USA","lithy"
1591,"2008-06-13",2.8,"Picked it up from Papous in Sylva, pours a white cream cloud burst.  Aroma is sweet and sticky alcohol.  Flavor is sweet, bitter dry and chalky.  Alcohol is very present.  Sweet and delecious","Sylva, North Carolina, USA","Collint"
1591,"2008-05-10",2.7,"The least impressive Nigori I have had. Pours a cloudy white color with some bubbles and flakes of white on the side of my sake cup. Nose is alcoholic and fruity (melons). Mouthfeel is both creamy and chalky. Finish is alcoholic and burning. Taste is banana and melon but somewhat off. Meh.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
1591,"2008-05-10",3.5,"(375 ml bottle from <A HREF=http://www.ratebeer.com/Place/maine/wiscasset target=blank>Treats) Served chilled and shaken. Pours milky white, looks like coconut milk. Aroma of sweet rice, yeast and alcohol. Mouthfeel is milk-like and grainy, a bit pasty - the fine solids give it quite a grainy texture that I liked. ""Lacing"" consists of a sheet of fine-grain, milky deposit lining the inside of the glass. Flavor of sweet rice-milk (if there is such a thing), yeast and alcohol. Its quite yeasty and hot. As it warms it also has a bit of a sour milk taste which I could see turning some people off. Different. Interesting and pretty good.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"
1591,"2008-05-06",3.4,"Bottle at Saburos Sushi House in Sellwood, Portland, OR--Shiny, milky white body.  Sweet, candy body.  Silky sharp and boozy flavor.  Nice rice.  Yum!","Portland, Oregon, USA","Angeloregon"
1591,"2008-04-28",2.6,"The aroma is sweet and fruity with coconut, rice, and alcohol. The appearance is milky white with some chalk. The flavor is like the aroma and appearance. The palate is thick. Overall a very good Nigori.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1591,"2008-03-26",2.6,"Bottle: Thick milky white with a very chewy appearance; tiny particles cling to the glass. The nose is musky with koji and fruit, light alcohol and some banana coconut notes. Not too sweet. Thick and no dimensioned, this is a beefy nigori with not much going for it in the flavor and nose department. Nothing completely aweful, just the texture, which is all it has. So, basically I dont like it.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1591,"2008-03-10",3.4,"375 ml bottle from City Market in Burlington, VT (March 2008) served cold from White Winter Winery glass.  Milky, thick, totally opaque and still -- seems almost milkshake-thick as it pours....very typical ricey-sweet, lightly nutty (almond-coconut) aroma, seems very fresh...quite sweet and thick, some bubblegum sugariness, indeed as thick as a milkshake, or nearly so, slightly gummy texture towards the finish, alcohol noticeable on the back end....just a bit too sweet and cloying, but overall quite solid.  Im mystified by the low scores...","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1591,"2007-11-02",0.8,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2007 this stuff fuckin sucks!!! I had an open mind and even wanted to try an unfiltered sake but this stuff really is horrible: I even had a different, more in depth review written out but I am throwing it out in order to say, AVOID THIS VOMIT INDUCING CRAP AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!  i would rather get my nuts cracked in than drink this semen juice.. 

next day, not as bad as last night, but still very rough... tryed filtering it...no go on that idea, I was about to chunk the rest out when i mixed it with this grapefruit drink stuff i got at an oriental store and it mixed up quite nice, still shitty but now at least i can drink it without heaving... No More Nigoris!!",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
1591,"2007-04-25",1.8,"Bottle.  Pours like a glass of milk with an aroma of weak rose hips and soft plastic.  Flavor is chalky, mushy cardboard.  Chunky and slightly harsh mouthfeel, like Mylanta.  Weird.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
1591,"2007-04-02",3.4,"Small bottle.  A very cloudy white looking pour.  Smelled quite intriguing to me.  The alcohol was there, but I felt like it belonged pretty well.  Theres a lot of sugar to the aroma, with some rice, and...I dunno, its tough to decipher.  Tastes wonderfully sweet and thick, without being heavy.  Theres a lot of sugar, some rice, bread, light plum flavor, and the finish is pretty clean to me.  It just kinda goes away.  This was pretty hot, but it didnt clash with spicy food the way beer does for me, which was great.  A perfect way to cut through the spiciest, most soysauce soaked sushi.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"
1591,"2006-05-24",2.6,"375 ml bottle. Shaken well, served chilled. Looks like milk with a small bit of chocolate syrup added. Bready rice aroma. Thick palate but thin texture. Overwhelming alcohol presence. Sweet taste though. Not among the best Nigori, but certainly not the worst sake as there is no bad aftertaste.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","molassesfan"
1591,"2006-01-07",2.1,"Pours cloudy white. Looks like a mixture of coconut milk and cream. Aroma of vanilla, and sweet fruits (coconut?). Taste is sweet and yeasty with a pronounced alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is thick, like heavy cream. Very strange. I didnt like it either.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","TheBeerOrg"
1591,"2005-09-13",1.7,"Served chilled in a wine glass at Virago, Nashville TN.  Unfiltered.  Looks like a mixture of soy milk and skim cow milk.  Leaves an even, transluscent film on the side of the glass.  In all, it didnt look promising; but this being my first sake, I tried to approach it with an open mind.  The mouthfeel was as I expected: light to medium bodied by beer standards, creamy, smooth.  This had a spicy alcohol bite at the very end which was the only hint of complexity.  To get there, you had to taste the ricey yeasty flavor in the middle; it was sweet like very diluted Splenda; it was grainy, but I wouldnt say ""vibrant"" or ""crisp.""  It was more musty and ""cloudy"" tasting, if that makes sense.  Smelled of rice and cucumber (but that could have lingered from the garnish).  I didnt really enjoy it that much.  I think Ill have to try other forms of sake.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"
