4477,"2016-04-22",5.0,"Ijsbok de 9 % abv, et 32 ebu. Quatre malts : munchen, caramunchen, pils et choco. Houblonné en
hallertau hersbrucker. Le tout sur du chêne américain.
Mon exemplaire avait 20 mois de bouteille, ce qui est un minimum et non un maximum ...
Signalons la présentation originale avec carton de collier couvrant toute la bouteille.
Couleur brun roux foncé, à la forte opacité (100 ebc).
Bulles fines, vives, par milliers partout.
Mousse brun clair bien crémeuse, stable à 4 mm. Superbe.
Arômes de malt torréfié, fût de whisky, chêne, muscade, pomme de pin.
1ère bouche veloutée au sublime ensemble malt/épices/bois.
Arrière-bouche bien maltée, dense, vineuse... et assez prodigieuse.
2ème sur un chai de bourgogne, avec une pointe de baies noires, touche de ganache.
Arrière-bouche complexe, longue.
3ème avec du vin encore, des tanins, du whisky et même un rien de tourbe.
Arrière-bouche longue, construite.
Longueur avec un développement du bois très important.
Jambes, fines, longues, marquées.
Levure un rien épicée, très belle ligne.
Alcool très bien, il construit lensemble.
Finale qui se déguste.
CONCLUSION : si on aime le bois, on en reçoit un maximum.
Sinon, il faut se concentrer sur la version ijsbok « normale », qui elle aussi est à 9 % abv et 32 ebu,
et axée sur les fruits mûrs. Les deux sont au top.","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"
