2071,"2017-05-25",3.2,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2017 Bottle. Moderate grain, cookie and roasted for the malt, light orange for the hops, light soap for the yeast, with baking spices and ripe apricot in the background. Head is small, frothy turning wispy, white, with some thin and slippery lacing, and is mostly diminishing. Color is sparkling clear gold. Flavor starts lightly to moderately sweet and lightly acidic, then finishes lightly to moderately bitter. Palate is light to medium, watery, with a soft to lively carbonation and a faintly alcoholic finish. Pretty tasty Biere de Garde, just a little flat in the finish.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

Drinks pretty pleasant for the style....which is more a a Brett Ale at this point than a Biere de Garde. Fruity, flowery lightness. Mild cherry hibiscus.

2071,"2016-08-06",4.0,"This was surprisingly complex and good. Fruity and floral flavors present but not overwhelming, very drinkable too.","USA","westknife"
2071,"2016-07-29",3.1,"Draft. Nose is moderately pineapple and tropical fruit. Pretty nice so far. Very clear deep yellow to gold with a small white head. Taste is less complex and just comes across as a sweet gold. Would like to see this one develop as the Brett just doesnt seem to have taken up much in the flavor. Decent.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"

2071,"2016-07-26",4.4,"Pours a hazy golden orange with a decent sized eggshell head that settles to a thick ring and leaves some dripping and spotting lace. Nose involves tart apple-skin brett character immediately, a bit lemony (even limey) and funky, some dusty hay notes, some very light caramel sweetness, a dash of orange and grapefruit, a really refreshing bretty nose. Lightly sweet, decently tart, somewhat bitter. Lighter bodied, effervescent, crisp, finishing with a lingering dusty tartness. This is so good. One of my favorite styles, and the brett character shines brightly. Another stand-out beer from one of my favorite breweries.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"

Earthy aroma with some bready notes and a hint of yeast. Flavor is sweet with some hints of raisins, yeast, a hint of spice and some baked brown bread. Mouthfeel is thick enough.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
2071,"2016-07-02",3.3,"Draft at WOB. Gold color with some cloudiness and a small head. Aroma of fruit, especially banana with yeast. Sweet malt taste with caramel and a touch of fruit. Little more that light body with a slight tart finish.","West Melbourne, Florida, USA","jhliesen"

2071,"2016-06-18",3.8,"Six pack sent for review. A really noticeable tangy fruit smell right out of the bottle, like a Goose Islands sour Sophie. The color is a little more substantial than other sour beers, which tend to be based on light wheat beers . The taste is quite full of pucker, maybe close to a sour cherry or green apple. There is also a bit of Belgian style funk to this, but likely its what they were deliberately shooting for. This also, however, has the backbone of slightly toasty Crystal malts that give this the feel of an actual beer. And while many sour styles are low in alcohol, this still hits the at 5.5% level of most megabrewed lawnmower beer. Do not expect your guests to slam down A Bretter Day at a weekend picnic. The tart still makes this a sipping beer, and expects you to pause for its own consideration.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
2071,"2016-06-18",4.1,"This has a super nice yeast character. Its almost over the top cherry-like without being too, too much. Its nice and light with gentle carbonation that lends a nice creamy quality. This is a perfect summer beer, light and delicious.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
2071,"2016-05-30",3.8,"Aroma is fruit, tropical fruit and and a hint of vanilla. The flavor is tropical fruit, fruit/juice, malts and a slightly sweet/funky/sour Brett finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
2071,"2016-05-17",3.9,"355ml bottle. Clear golden pour, nice head. The aroma is massive. Huge tropical fruity brett, smarties, banana. Flavor has a sweetish malt character, plenty of tropical brett, herbal hops, toffee, fairly big malt character which is odd but works at 5.5% its fuller bodied but drinkable. This is a nice beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
2071,"2016-05-07",3.4,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2016 On tap at the Warrenville Tap House bar during UKG Big Brew Day, and dispensed to a shaker showing a clear & bright golden hue, with a presentable layer of white head foam, and spots & strands of lacing. The nose was light malt/caramel sweetness, subtle yeast with only slight funkiness, and light, spicy phenols. Light to medium bodied, with decent carbonation, the taste added moderate earthy bitterness with a hint of rind, dryness, followed by a touch of tartness. Mild, smooth lager nature, but didnt perceive any cellar character that is common to this style.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
