4450,"2017-06-22",4.0,"Tap at Oedipus. Hazy deep dark pink with light pink head. Definately lots of cherries and raspberries, soft funk and hay, light minerals, sharp red berries, theres some sharp granite/sand kind of notes almost going into fermented chilies. Quite fruity, good sharpness but lacks some funk maybe. Over medium sour and under medium bitter. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation. Good effort.","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","Maakun"

4450,"2017-06-10",4.1,"375 ml bottle. Pretty, glowing pink-red color with lace; cloudy. Great raspberry jam nose, cherry, wood, dry. Quite acidic flavor, more than the other 2, with a bit of a burn, and awesome fruit flavors. More sour than the others, yet still soft and not over the top. Lovely stuff, the best of the three we had by far.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
4450,"2017-06-05",4.4,"Bottle, 375ml. Pours cloudy dark magenta, small off-white pinkish head, decent lacing. Aroma is raspberry, loads of funk, cheese, basement, brett. Flavor is dry, light plus tart, quite funky, nice earthy basement tones with light cheese, horseblanket and the like. Berries dominate, with raspberry taking the forefront. Very lambic-like indeed. Light plus body, soft mouthfeel. Pretty excellent, really.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

4450,"2017-02-19",4.0,"37.5cl can, partagée avec la BXL tasting crew, merci Pierre T. 
Couleur rosâtre, acajou, col fin rosé pas perdurant.
Nez est dominé par la framboise qui offre des effluves terreuses et fleuries. Cerise reste que très modeste et le style Balaton diminue leffet aigrelet des framboises.
Palais offre un savant mélange de lambics à leffet de funk, cuir ponctué par un profil râpeux centré sur la framboise. Ce dernier donne un fini acidulé qui montre bien lusage de fruits complets. Tout comme pour larôme les cerises semblent plus adoucir le caractère tranchant des framboises. Le tout couplé à une base de grains apportant suffisamment de funk et un léger boisé.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

4450,"2017-02-02",4.5,"From notes. Had at a tasting with the group at Eriks house on January 22. 375 mL bottle. The pour is a dirtier ruby pink color with a thin ring of light pink that fades quickly. The aroma is pretty fantastic. Its bright and sour fruit. The raspberry and cherry balance out very well through the whole thing. There is a light oak, and a pretty strong funk toward the finish. The fruits remain dominant. The flavor is much of the same. I love the sour fruits that control this. The oak and funk really balance out the flavor, but the fruit remains supreme, which is fantastic. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly sour fruit that lasts for days. All it does is make my mouth water for the next sip!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

4450,"2016-12-31",4.2,"(375ml bottle) clear deep red, pretty color, and fine white bubbles. Nose prominent of cherries, pedio and lacto, barrel, nice mix of bugs, horseblanket if coaxed. Taste of cherries and raspberries, a touch funky, more gueuze base than the peach and apricot comes through, still more American style than a true Belgian especially when compared to the unfruited versions which are pretty Belgian-like,crisp and refreshing.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
4450,"2016-12-16",4.1,"On draft at the source. Pours plum purple with a pink head. Medium sweetness. Medium mouthfeel. Very jammy. Leather, raspberry pie, cherry tart.","Bellaire, Texas, USA","gephross100"
4450,"2016-11-11",4.2,"Pour from a 375 ml bottle at the Shelton Brothers Festival. Pours a hazy ruby color with a pink-tinted head that settles into a ring and island of film. Like the other fruited SPON, this has loads of the two featured fruits, sweet and tart, with florals, mild spice, oak, earth, and red wine vinegar. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a tart, funky, floral mouthfeel. Id give this one the slight edge to the Peach & Apricot one. But both are excellent.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
4450,"2016-10-29",4.1,"Pour at Shelton Bros. Just so well balanced amid the fruits - the pinkish hue and raspberry notes. Great.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
