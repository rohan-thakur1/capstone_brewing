1754,"2016-10-21",3.7,"Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a rugged burnt dark orange almost brownish red color, sly transparency. Just a cap of a light filmy head quickly dissipates. Milky thin lacing.
The aroma smells like a good Vienna lager (SA flagship), crisp bready/German yeasty sweetness with a sly grassy hoppy warmth. Slight cake almost biscuity malts as well.
The flavor resides between the balancing sweetness of the grassy hops to the biscuity malts. Light spice (nutmeg, maybe?). Balanced malty to hoppy aftertaste. Sly malty finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great sessionability about it. Carbonation runs nicely. Malts play smoothly on my tongue.
Overall, I would say this was a pretty nice Vienna lager that I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
1754,"2012-02-22",3.6,"In short: A clean and well balanced golden lager.  Just plain simple and nice.
How: Tap at brewpub.  That batch was listed at 5.5%
The look: Almost clear golden body topped by a small white head
In long: Nose has smooth leafy and flowery hops and notes of caramel.  Tastes starts with a crisp toasted caramelized malt backbone and a varied assortment of dried fruits.  Then the leafy hops dry the finish without creating much bitterness.  A nice transition between the tasty sweet malts and the moderately dry finish.  A very clean beer.  Certainly not original or complex but this is nonetheless a very nice session beer.  Another nice beer from Zero Gravity and thats just a bonus because I mainly go to the pub for their pizza.  And if it is true that each pint of beer takes 2 minutes off your life, each slice of pizza with bacon takes 9 minutes, and each cigarette takes 7 minutes, then according to my calculations I died before I was born.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1754,"2008-07-15",3.5,"On tap at the brewpub.  Color seemed darker than a traditional lager.  Smelled of malts but also a little sweet.  Very nice and drinkable beer.","Havertown, Pennsylvania, USA","jmm635"

1754,"2006-04-18",3.3,"(Draught) Sampled at American Flatbread on April 13, 2006. Pours a almond-coloured, creamy head with a brownish-copper body. Nose of bread and caramel. Flavours of vanilla and roasted malt and grains fill out the finish. Oily, yet thin. Fairly good but bland.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
1754,"2006-03-17",3.7,"Draught pint at the brewery with Muzzlehatch on 3/12/06.Clear, burnished brass body with some cookie-graham cracker tones, bit of old cream yellow.  Very small amount of off-white head that is not long retained, forming a ring on the edge, with no lacing.  Large bubbles rest throughout the liquid.Its funny how after having two similar gravity German beers, brewed around the same time here (Helles, Spalter Alt), that this one comes out with much less heavy yeast, more bright hop and yeast character and just more refreshing, as the other two should have been.  The nose right away divulges a glorious, intricate web of lightly sticky caramel, dry, crumbly coffee-cake, perfectly pitted against each other, with a triumphant noble hop spiciness, combined with a crisp lager yeast, steadily growing to a climax on the finish of an almost perfumy, tingling note, with light yeast.  All the while a wise, yet never too sweet woody-caramel character sits patiently behind.  I didnt find as much caramel as Barry, but all the same, I found the hop and yeast qualities to be lively, not overdone and bright.Flavor begins with a dry, husky vienna malt, touches of roots and coffee, but adding dry, spicy hops and old, tanninless wood notes before it gets too watery (fair amount of water, though as it should be for this session style).  At first, while cold/chilled, the sweetness from the munich or cara malts is held well in check, perfectly balancing the beer, while the yeast remains quite apparent, but crisp and lively.  Carbonation is rather zippy at first, but carries the hoppiness and yeast across the palate and helps deliver the zesty finish, almost woody/herbal-like, though retaining the dry caramel.  As Barry says, with warmth and breath, the beer begins to get a bit too sluggish with sweetly-sour malts and the yeast begins to build up (though nowhere near the alt or helles level).  Watery texture, lively carbonation, no alcohol.  Its always enjoyable to find a beer that you can just drink and appreciate chilled, being refreshed, without having to stare at it for a half hour while it warms up.  My score reflects the flavor/palate while it is at a chilled temperature.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1754,"2006-03-14",3.7,"Draught pint at the brewpub in the company of the mysterious and etherious ClarkVV.  We came back on Sunday just after opening for this and it wasnt crowded at all at the bar, so we could savor this really excellent rendition...it poured a deep amber-brown with little head...it smelled of caramel, more freshly-made caramel maybe than Ive ever smelled in a beer, wow! and vanilla and toasty grains and very light noble hops and just a touch of grape....on the tongue, more grapiness and a bit of lactic acid are evident but not enough to spoil the thick, malty-sweet pleasures with light green hops and new oak and rough fresh-milled graininess....it becomes a bit too sweet and almost cloying as it warms, but on the whole this is an excellent, well-nigh spectacular example of an undervalued style and I will be back for another (or two) before it disappears....","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
