4294,"2014-06-04",3.2,"Bottle at home. No fizz when popping the cap....It pours hazy golden with a small bubbly head. The nose soft, malt-driven, fresh bread, hay, light sweetness and earth. The taste is bitter, bready, toasted grass, grain, citrus peel, spice and biscuit with a dry, earthy finish. Medium body and low carbonation. Actually pretty tasty, just a shame about the lack of carbonation...","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"

4294,"2014-05-24",3.3,"500ml bottle shared with mr_h. Yellow orange colour, not much head. Sweet orange malt aroma. Orange corn grain flavour. Bitter sweet aftertaste. A Scottish take on a German style beer with a bit extra flavour.","Glasgow, SCOTLAND","JohnRMurdoch"
4294,"2014-05-05",3.8,"500ml bottle from Great Grog. Pours clear gold, thick white head. Aromas are honey, straw, something herbal and lemony. Taste is light sweet, more lemon herbal bitterness. Light sweet finish. Nice.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","allmyvinyl"
4294,"2014-04-28",3.4,"Bottle from Cornelius. Hazy golden body with tiny yeast flecks. Faint carbonation. Thick white head. Aroma of straw, earth, white bread and marzipan. Subtle flavour of soft, sweet malt and earthy hops. Lemony finish. Tastes like a cross between a Pilsner and a Pale Ale. Medium body with an oily texture. Light fizz. A nice beer, but (for me) not one of Luckie Ales finest.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","jamestulloch"

4294,"2014-04-18",3.7,"[500ml bottle, The Beer Hive, Edinburgh] Pours a very slightly hazy golden colour, with a very thing head that reduces quickly to a flecked lacing. On the nose, bready dry honey. On the taste, sweet bready elements, some orange, peachy fruit, leading to a creamy, malted milk-biscuit finish. Sweetens as it rises, very nice [18042014]","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","BeerCast_Rich"
4294,"2014-04-16",3.6,"Firm golden with a decent visible carbonation rising to a not so visible ringed head. Stern breadiness on the nose, kind of peppery and oily with some earthy sweet fruits. Initial taste is all little touches of dryness, light lemon and even a bit of orange peel. Mainstay flavours are tinfoil lemon, yeasty banana all wrapped up in a sweet biscuity dough. Carbonation isnt palate shaking and fades quite a bit, leaving a more evocative and peppery banananess. Finish is steely and bitter, but over all screwing in the dryness. Very quenching if a bit oddly clinical about it.Bottle, Beer Hive, Edinburgh","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","McNeillR"
