2141,"2014-04-28",4.0,"This was courtesy of Strykzone who brought a half growler to Dark Lord Day 2014. !n the glass it is a deep amber with an off-white head. The nose is woody...spruce and cedar. Lots of brett. Medium body. Flavor is very complex with the wood and brett in perfect unison with fruit as well. Finish is spicy. Another unique beer from Scratch. They really do some interesting beers.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
2141,"2014-03-01",4.0,"Sampled at the Scratch 1st anniversary party. Pours dark brown with a tan head. the aroma has sour fruit, toasty malt, brett bugs, light citrus and a liquor aspect - interesting and complex. It has a medium body with a mild amount of carbonation. The taste starts off with mild sweet malt, light sourness, lots of herbs and some wildness. The finish has some nectar fruits, light bugs and really is quite refreshing for a 7% beer that has so much going on.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

2141,"2014-02-26",3.4,"Mini growler during RBWG GT. Poured a thinner clear light brown with a frothy deep beige spotty head. Aroma was floral and medicinal with notes of ginger, juniper, spruce. Medium body with softer carbonation. Flavor is the same as the aroma plus some additional notes of earth and light chocolate. Interesting for sure.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
2141,"2014-02-25",3.8,"Half growler shared by Strykzone at the RBWG Grand Tasting - thanks again, Dave! Pours a mahogany color with an off-white head. Notes of cedar, spruce, leaves, florals, anise, juniper berries, and bretty funk. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a spicy, fruity mouthfeel. I really liked this. So unique.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2141,"2014-02-23",3.6,"Growler sample at RBWG grand tasting. Pours a clear cola brown with a medium sized beige head. The aroma and flavor have a base bready malt, mint, cedar, lighter tannin notes, mild Brett character, floral and herbal. Interesting stuff.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
2141,"2014-02-21",3.5,"Growler at RBWG 2014 grand tasting, thanks! Pours a deep amber red with a tan head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a surprising amount of menthol with notes of barrel, tannins and light fruits with some sweet grains. Flavor has notes of menthol and sage with light tart fruits, oak and a good amount of earthiness. Odd and different.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"

2141,"2014-02-15",4.0,"Dark pour. The cedar is really noticeable and a little change form the standard juniper.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
2141,"2014-02-14",3.5,"on tap @ localoptionbier. didnt get the cedar, but still complex, with the brett (bret sounds like a guy) and red wine, and interesting.","Illinois, USA","zebra"
2141,"2014-02-08",3.9,"Sampled from a growler. Dark brown with a blotchy head. Bret in the sroma with minty herbal notes. The feel is thin. To say this has herbal flavors is not relly to do it justice. Leagy, mintiness. Wood, too. So much naturalness here. I am not really sure how to describe it. Cedar is evident. Mushrooms and the inside of a barrel flavors. The bret is tnere but there is just so much going on. A wow.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
2141,"2014-02-08",3.6,"Growler - Medicinal, leafy and mint. Jet black with a brown head. Leary, mint and more herbal leaf. Brett shines through, I am sure this is making me healthy.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2141,"2014-02-08",3.6,"Taster at RBWG 2014 grand tasting - thanks to the person who shared this! From a 32oz growler. RIP Bret. Mostly clear dark brown color, kind of a cola appearance. Thin off-white / light brown khaki head. Little lace sticks. Big pine in the nose, nice cedar wood notes. Medium - plus body. Smooth, lighter carbonation. More dry finish. Good bigger zesty taste, moderate herbal bitterness. Dont get much barrel character, maybe just a little bit of wine-like tannic if I look for it. But this is an awesome, complex sahti! Definitely very different from others Ive had","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
