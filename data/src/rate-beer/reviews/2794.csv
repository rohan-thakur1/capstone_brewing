S - Sweet malt with a touch of toasted cereal grain. Floral honey, brown sugar, grassy hops.

Great looking beer. Just what youd expect from a Czech Marzen. Great malt profile with plenty of noble hops to balance it out. Very satisfying.

2794,"2007-11-01",4.2,"Toasty and bready malts are strong in the nose with some dark fruity esters.  Light haze to the deep amber copper coloured body topped by a creamy, fine bubbled, sticky off white head that lasts well.  Assertive bitterness matches well to the intense bready malt sweetness.  Medium body with strong, fine bubbled effervescence that really opens up the palate.  Tulip glass.  Just above fridge temperature.

Crisp and clean on the palate with earth, toast, caramel...the complex simplicity of the finest East Van pho.

2794,"2007-04-21",3.2,"Bottle. Pours with an amber color. Aroma is more like that of an Pilsener, some musty notes and some malty notes. Flavor gets better when the beer warms up. It brings out some complexity then, with flavors of apricot, hops and dough. Body is medium, all in all not a bad beer.","Bay Area, California, USA","HopheadHans"
2794,"2007-03-27",3.1,"12 oz bottle VIA Malt of The Earth Beer Club. Pours a clear amber with an average size beige head. I am not getting much aroma here, just some subtle slightly biscuity malts.Interesting flavors. Starts sweet but quickly turns bitter. I detect some toastiness, a tiny bit of chocolate malt, and some grassy/spicey hops in the crisp finish. A bit of a metallic aftertaste. Medium body. Medium carbonation.","Oregon, USA","kenb"
2794,"2007-02-09",3.2,"Draught at Soldaten Svejk, Stockholm.  Clear amber, very rich creamy head. Aroma of caramel with a light touch of hay-like saaz hops. Medium bodied, lightly fruity, clean rounded mouthfeel. The body is very solid for a Czech beer, but then 13° beers are not that common. Also a bit low on personality, but I guess Pivovar Náchod has grown considerably lately. Finishes with medium bitterness. A more than decent effort that I am very willing to come back to.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"

2794,"2006-09-14",3.3,"Bottle: Clear, amber coloured, small lacing head, quickly diminishing to a small foamy layer; the aroma is a mix of dark sweet malt and toasted malt and an aromatic bitterness; moderate to strong sweet-bitter flavour, light bodied; first toasted malty, then bitter-sweet lingering finish. An interesting brew, that combines quite well the qualties of a Dunkel and a Bohemian Pils (Polotmavy means ""half-dark""). Nice....","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"

However, I liked it.  Dark caramel/red colour with beige head.  Toffee/caramel aroma.  Fine in mouth, more caramel, finish is a bit sweet.  Not too much hop.  Good caramel/malt beer.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
