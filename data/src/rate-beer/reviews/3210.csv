3210,"2016-10-14",3.8,"355ml can from LCBO. Pours a clear deep gold colour with one finger of head. Refreshing citrus and bread on the nose. Taste starts off as your typical North American lager but without any specific after-taste. Hoppy flavours lead to a well balanced finish. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Not bad.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","cattaneopapa"
3210,"2016-07-09",2.5,"Cloudy orange, foamed like crazy out of the can. Not getting much of any hops or malt. Meh.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","tmalaher"
3210,"2016-06-30",3.5,"Appearance: A lightly benighted field of straw....

Aroma : weed tangled earthiness and long wet hair whipping you in the nose. A former sour dough bread package flits by on the breeze of old cut flowers entering the fragrant stage of decomposition. Dirty yeast motes ping in the background radiance. An occasional waft of dead breath reminds one of ordinary mortality.....

Taste: citrus infused dough becoming biscuits with a dash of dried orange peel fragments. On the side rest shy, muted candies. The imbibing ends in a big, lingering uncarbonated orange crush kiss.","British Columbia, CANADA","Kobold"
3210,"2015-09-06",2.6,"355 ml can from LCBO, served cold in a tulip glass. 
App.: Cloudy amber with a tight, off-white meringue.
 
Aroma: Slightly sweet bread crust maltiness, a little bit of non-specific fruitiness, floral/woodsy hops, a touch of green herbal/grassiness, may be a touch spicy (phenolic...?), 
 
Palate: Medium body, sloppy carbonation.
 
Flav.: Quite fruity, apples/cider for sure, quite malty, limited floral/woodsy/slightly grassy hops, quite a lot going on for a lager; almost dry with low bitterness and a quite malty and somewhat fruity finish.

This resembles a moderate home brew interpretation of a Dort. Not as good as expected from these guys.","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"
3210,"2015-08-14",3.1,"Shared 355ml. can poured to a snifter showing a cloudy, orangey gold color, with modest, soft white head foam, and spotty lacing. The nose was light grain/soft malt, with subtle esters as peach/apricot. Light bodied, with fair carbonation, the taste was similar notes as the aroma, nearly watery texture, and lightly dry finish. Fair hydrator/session brew.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
3210,"2015-08-06",3.4,"Clean and slightly sweet lager. A hint of warming booziness that you dont see in other Canadian lagers. Lower carbonation, which makes this hysterically easy to drink.","Brussels, BELGIUM","adamnowek"
3210,"2015-06-26",3.0,"Draft - Sweet grains. Clear gold with a decent white head. Pale malts and grains with a nice sweetness. Sweet, harmless and light.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
3210,"2015-06-01",3.3,"On tap at Howe Sound, pours a clear pale golden yellow with a small white head. Nose brings out notes of corn, light grass and crisp crackery malt. Flavour is very clean and refreshing, with notes of grassy notes, corn, and crisp biscuity malt. Seems more like a pils than regular pale lager. Clean and refreshing. Very nice.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3210,"2015-04-29",3.5,"Thanks to AleRider78 for this one. Pours a hazy golden-amber colour with a frothy off-white head that stays a while and gives out thick foamy lacing. Cereal malts with a little sweetness giving notes of fruits (oranges, raisins, prunes, apricots). The taste is more on the caramel side with a quick finish. Better than a typical macro lager, this Dortmunder is quite easy to drink. Pretty different than their 1L brews, but does the job.","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
3210,"2015-04-27",3.0,"Pours a good size frothy off-white head and has a pale golden appearance. Fairly excessive carbonation. Thick dirty lacing. Aromas are very malty, bready and toasty malts. Also a bit of grainy hints. Flavours are mostly malty, sweet and bready malts with faint hints of caramel. A bit of a rusty like finish. Pretty average lager with nothing outstanding.","Winchester, Ontario, CANADA","AleRider78"
3210,"2015-03-20",3.3,"This is just a well made lager. Nothing spectacular, nothing mindblowing. Just a here drink this and dont think too much about it beer. Love it.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","cfrancis"
3210,"2015-03-06",3.7,"Wow! A pale lager that actually has some hop aroma and flavour! Grassy, and subtle, with some super solid cereals. The mouth feel is a little fuller than I expected, but the flavour is there. The ultimate lawn mower beer. A great pale lager. This should be in ever bar to convert macro drinkers.","Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, CANADA","robinvboyer"
3210,"2015-03-04",0.7,"To call this lager bland would be overly generous, overwhelming aftertaste of sugar stuck on the palate","","OldHoppy"
3210,"2015-02-07",2.1,"Sweet, bland, pale stuff. I guess they sell it but I cant imagine why. Its certainly nothing close to a dortmunder - not even a bad one.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
3210,"2014-12-18",3.3,"Im a lager fancier and Dortmund helles is one of my favorite quaffs (when I find it relatively fresh), Lager is not as simple as popular myth has it - its actually a very delicate brew with decent malt complexity and its easy to screw up with poor mashing and sparging technique - anyway this sample is fairly well done...it has been age filtered and has a delicate nose to it, big malt delivery with fair hop balance, medium body and long doughy finish with light bready sweetness in the finish, A good Dortmunder rendition, but not outstanding.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"
3210,"2014-11-27",3.5,"355 ml can from LCBO. Clear deep yellow with white head. Smells of euro hops, grain, some fruit. Same notes for the taste. Full flavoured german-style lager. Would be a go-to if the price per can came down a bit.","Ontario, CANADA","deepeary"
3210,"2014-05-13",3.4,"355ml can. Hazy gold pour. Very large and sticky white cap with lots of thick lacing. Nose has grain and bread, mild grass. Taste has bready malts, light caramel. Grassy aftertaste with mild bitterness. Surprisingly good premium lager.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","pintbypint"
3210,"2014-02-21",3.4,"Deep golden pour with a thick white head. The nose is nicely malty. Clean and lightly honeyed with some soft herbal/floral hop aroma and flavour. A little bit of sweetness and some soft caramelly flavour. They call it a Dortmunder - but it isnt.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3210,"2013-09-18",3.8,"Pretty ""ballsy for a lager... it has a true manly taste to it compared to the usual commercial crap. Nice overall taste.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","MarkQ"
3210,"2013-08-23",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2014 Pours a pale gold with a nice frothy & lacey white head. Aroma of sweet pale malts, bready malts and sweet fruity esters.

3210,"2013-08-20",3.1,"Tap. Golden with small head. Mild lager. Light but decently flavorful. As lagers go, this is really good.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"
3210,"2013-06-05",3.5,"Pours a hazy golden/amber colour with a consistent dull white head and great legs. Aroma is floral, some biscuits, and grainy. Flavour is grassy, mild up front sweetness, mild spicy bitterness, quite crisp, and slightly dry on the finish. This is a tasty, refreshing lager. Brought it as an intro to craft to my friends and success! Will be doing it again.","Alberta, CANADA","andrewturba"

3210,"2013-04-25",3.2,"A solid little canned session brew. This is awesome for a long weekend or to take to a party with none craft brew friends. Mild toasted malts, hints of grassy spiced hops and a hint of mild caramel malt. Very well balanced and nice crisp flavour.","Alberta, CANADA","patricks110"
3210,"2013-04-04",3.0,"355ml can pours a golden amber color with a finger of white head that settles quite quickly and leaves virtually no lacing on the glass.  Aroma is caramel and grass.  Taste is a grassy hop bitterness with a light caramel malty sweetness.  Light to medium body with average carbonation for the style.  Not quite as grassy as a typical macro lager.  This is one of the better lagers out there.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
3210,"2013-01-14",2.4,"Can @ Only Cafe poured a semi hazy gold, worryingly stable dense white head. Aroma of sweet field grass and prickle of yeasty lager edge. Taste seems to be flawed with evident peanut and/or dried peas DMS. Yet has pale fruit, bready pale malt/caramel  sweetness and some grainy flavors, grassy hop palate and sweet-dry finish. Firmly mediocre and boring whatever style you call it.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DerWeg"

Clear and golden with a big white head that fades quickly. Aroma is hopped spices and biscuit malt, as is the taste, with some caramel sweetness. Nicely balanced, and refreshing, light bitter finish","British Columbia, CANADA","Lagerboy"
3210,"2011-09-02",2.8,"Can 355 ml 
Aroma:  malty, average in crispness, slight fruity elements, caramel hints. 4+
Appearance:  amber with initial plus sized top that quickly vanished to light fizz. No lace. 
Body , Flavour , Palate and Final Notes:   medium light bodied. Caramel sweet malt with slight leafy hops on side. Dry , thinner top end. Slightly mineral ending. Finish closest resembles Dortmunder style yet front and top is too fruity. Malt work is also slightly off the traditional mark. I remember Dortmunders to have big higher carbonation as well. This one was fairly flat. Refreshing overall, not exactly Dortmunder.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"
3210,"2011-08-15",2.7,"Draught at the Alibi Room, VancouverDeep blond color; compact head. A simple Lager, dry, correctly bodied, with a touch of peanuts both in the aroma and flavor; correct bitterness, the final is also a bit metallic.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
3210,"2011-08-09",3.7,"Bready aroma, some spicy hops.  Golden colour with good head retention, not quite brilliantly clear.  Great malt flavour with hop bitterness to balance.  Slight sweetness.  Good amount of mouthfeel.  Overall an excellent lager to drink on a hot day.","British Columbia, CANADA","ardiesr"
