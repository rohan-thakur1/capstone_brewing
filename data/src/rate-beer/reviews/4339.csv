Pours clear, dark rose-amber with a good head. 

The high ABV is still rather pronounced in this aged bottle but acceptable in the flavor. Rich, complex flavor is bitter-sweet, leaning to sweet early on but mildly bitter by the aftertaste.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

4339,"2012-11-24",3.2,"Appearance:
Dark coppers and wood along the edges and dark purple grape and plum skin hues in the middle. A bubbly collar borders a thin film of white broken in random places.

Nose:
Moist chewy breads replete with sweet summer peaches, pears, and apples  fresh, ripe, and juicy sweet. Rye toast and rye seeds pepper the bread while the back finishes dry. Whispers of berry and rhubarb along the edges and in the back. Mint and basil. Strawberries and raspberries.

Palate:
Sweet, spicy, and dry. Apricots, peaches, plums, and grapes in the middle with rhubarb stalks and rye toast in the back. Parching with a lingering presence of orange pith. Thin crunchy toffee sweetness along the edges. Intriguing interplay of strawberries and raspberries. Candied ginger nips at the very back of each swallow. Long after the swallow, pink grapefruit comes out to play.

Final Thoughts:
A truly intriguing eclectic beer that somehow managed to get everything to work together. A lot of things were going on in the nose, the palate, and the finish yet nothing felt out of touch or out of place. Wins points on uniqueness alone, and it tasted good too.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"
4339,"2012-10-11",3.8,"Bottle from I forget - thanks anyway!  Hazy light brown pour with a tan head.  Aroma is thick caramel and sweet malt with darker fruit notes and background pine bitterness.  Taste is smooth caramel, sweet malt, barley wine type notes, figs, and a pleasant hop bitterness.  Smooth mouthfeel.  Generally not a fan of the high ABV, strong ale type beers but this was balanced and enjoyable.  Very nice beer.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"

Flavor is light pitted yellow fruits, heather, earth, dark pitted fruits (this stuff keeps moving around, flavorwise). Its a bit leathery. Definitely, tho subtly floral. Smooth roasted malt - not at all harsh. Heat is hardly noticeable. The bitter keeps fighting off the malt. It is ""fresh"". It is old. Brilliant ale. Really.

4339,"2012-04-09",2.6,"Appearance: Pours out a darkish, amber-tan body with a medium-small, ivory-hued head.

Smell: Lightly bready though fairly sweet-scented malts with a loose candyish quality, a noted booziness, hint of leafy green veg, and scantly tart fruits. Gee.

Taste: Bready malts hit by a blast of cutting unrefined sweetness lightly hinting toffee and light-colored brown sugar, but mainly just sugary. Growing vegetal accent of grandmothers famous braised kale and a quick-warming alcohol presence. Soiled, lightly tart apricot and lightly pithy citrus accents. Medium-high bitterness. Squashed-together, muddled flavors on the bitterish, heated, frown-inducing finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation.

4339,"2012-03-25",2.7,"Man, surprised to see so many high ratings for this one. Pretty clear copper pour with little carbonation and an oily consistency to it. Nose of pure candied malts and booze. Slick mouthfeel, hot palate. I found it a mess of a beer, just way too sweet and sharp, with almost no detectable personality beyond its negative traits. I actually found myself craving face-throttlingly excessive hops, as that at least would have livened the beer up a bit. Turgid with sugar.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
4339,"2012-03-23",3.5,"Aroma is not particularly strong, but does invite with its firm maltiness and fruity note of apple and pear, along with a hint of caramel. It comes out of the bottle a clear, dark coppery amber with a respectable light golden-tan head. Mouth-filling flavor is more than what the aroma promises: a malty and fruity core, notes of apple and pear, hints of caramel and wood, and a firm alcohol bite that lets you know this is indeed a strong ale. Smooth, firm texture has minimal fizz, and leaves a woody, slightly tinny finish. Though not Sweetwaters best, this is still a worthy brew.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
4339,"2012-03-22",3.8,"650 ml. Clear, darkish copper with a lasting quarter inch of sticky foam. Sweet nose of caramel apple and fresh oranges is tempered by some oak.

Citrus bitterness gives way to a pleasantly sweet malt backbone of toasted malt and some dark fruit.  Light lingering bitterness and fruit.  Some noticeable alcohol with light burn, but not overly detracting.  In some ways it reminds me a bit of Lord Admiral Nelson from FFF.  Maybe a tad sweeter and less dry.  A success.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"

Pours a amber/ruby with thin head.  After a few sips not much lace but more of a syrupy film.  Smell is sweet caramel, bread, dark ripe fruits and sugar cane. Taste initially was sweet caramel but lends to some dark fruit, breadiness, earthy hops, more caramel, cotton candy, some yeast.  For 10%, it doesnt show hardly any booze, however it is quite sweet, but in a very soft and not sickening way.  In fact, the whole flavor profile is rich and full, but very mild.  Reminds me of the bastard love child of an imperial amber, quad and barley wine.  Mouthfeel is sloshy and oily.  Very nice.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"

4339,"2012-02-11",3.1,"22oz bottle, very fresh release.  Served at around 45F.

Pours lightly cloudy copper/amber with a nice two finger off-white light beige head that leaves really nice sticky bubbles of drippy lacing and recedes to a foamy island and ring.  Before long, all head and lacing disappear for a flat appearance.

Aroma is caramel, toffee, grassy and earthy hops, fairly fruity, bread.  Pretty sweet, some alcohol.  Good strength.

Flavor starts with some sweet malt, toffee, caramel, some fruit, some bread, molasses, finishes with a nice hop punch featuring some pine, grass and citrus, good bitterness on the finish.  Quite a bit of candy sweetness throughout (akin to the recent Dank Tank 420).  Decent bit of alcohol at the end as well.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily, a bit sticky, moderate carbonation.

Initially I was rather meh on this, but let it warm up a bit and it starts to open up.  Let it warm too much and it just gets messy.  Still a bit sweeter than I like for my tastes, and IMHO a style that doesnt really need to be jacked up to 10% ABV.
