1847,"2012-12-27",3.8,"Golden peach.  Saliva-inducing nose of honey-soaked malt, pineapple marmalade, peach phyllo tart, vanilla cake, rising bread, and flowery apricots. Hint of gooseberry and persimmon. Subdued, softly prickly carbonation. Densely sweet, initially, with a weighty onslaught of cakey pale malt and a mild nip of alcohol. Assertive yet refined and well-layered hops contribute a mild tingle of acidity as their viscous nectars ooze with a mouthwatering sappiness. Captivatingly soft and seductive hoppiness, with that telltale Saphir character of honeysuckle nectar. Some very fresh grassiness in there, as well. Burly yet polished and nonintrusive malt matches the resounding hoppy succulence with delicate yet deeply satiating waves of sweetly dextrinous, pastrylike richness and even some very finespun hay dust. High level of malt sugars persists toward the otherwise harmonious finish of luscious marmalade and slippery tropical fruits (kumquat, pineapple) slathered atop well-textured pale malt. Certainly on the sweet side, but rather than coming off as syrupy or hot, as most heller bocks trend towards, this is quite succulent and well-balanced. Quite good.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

The flavor is really nice. Not like most heller bocks. This one isnt as sweet and the flavor and body both feel lighter and crisper than the typical helles bock.

Aroma of hops hops, fruit, sugar, and sniff of booze. The first thing I will talk about is whether or not the beer successfully covers the alcohol, which is a consistent failing of Heller Bocks: it does, so at least on those grounds this is a better beer than Holsten Maibock. There is a good amount of hops and as some other people have noted, this is an over-hopping iteration of this style. However, I dont think that it is well balanced. There are some off flavors in there, and even a tiny bit of booze as it warms up. Not my favorite, although I knew that before I bought it, but I still did.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

1847,"2011-04-08",2.8,"500ml bottle, as fresh as we can possibly get it here in the States.  The body is a clear, shining, almost metallic shade of gold.  A small, smooth head of just barely off-white foam settles in as a thin, patchy layer, leaving sticky swaths of wavy ring lacing behind.  Even at this relatively fresh juncture, the nose seems just a bit stale, showing notes of day-old sourdough, baked golden raisins, and sugar-heavy dessert bread yeast in the malt base.  Despite all that sweetness, the hops do make a strong showing, touching on dried grasses, straw, and citrus blossoms.  I venture to guess that Id quite like this varietal in a pils or some other better attenuated beer. Flavors show more of the same, burdened by heavy golden raisin and blonde candy sugar, and touching heavily on super yeasty and sugary dough.  Grassy, pithy hops do provide a nice bitterness on the back end, but it doesnt cover for the gross under-attenuation that plagues this, and almost all other Heller Bocks.  Predictably, the palate is sticky, laboring, and mouth coating.  Moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation tries to cut through, but gets bogged down in the sugars.  This beer is just a testament to the fact that you cant take a poorly designed base product and load it with hops to save the day.  Disappointing brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
