804,"2013-11-26",3.7,"Bomber, courtesy of Archer Liquors, Chicago, pours an amber brown color with no head. Nose is fruity and sweet. Taste is rich in bananas and cloves and full of flavor. Ends smoothly on the palate on the same tasting notes. An excellent dunkelweizen. Quaff Score 8 / 10","Coral Springs, Florida, USA","jjgmd"
804,"2013-11-26",3.5,"Pours an amber brown with a beige head and aroma of banana, wheat, and malt. Fruit and spice notes at first - cloves, banana with caramel, sweet malt, and bready notes leading to a malty sweet finish. Solid, drinkable dunkel","Coral Springs, Florida, USA","zgaier"
804,"2013-11-06",3.2,"Bottle. Orange pour wit ha white head. Aroma is light caramel maltiness with some banana character floating around. Flavor is almost exactly the same. Low character beer, but not terrible.","Greenbelt, Maryland, USA","ApisAles"
804,"2013-10-26",3.7,"Bottle. Dont remember where I got it, somewhere in Chicago, West Lakeview maybe. Pours a dark, almost-opaque brown. Taste is very sweet, a little bit of licorice. Not too heavy, not too light, a good balance. I enjoyed this beer.","Buffalo, New York, USA","pete4999"
804,"2013-10-22",3.2,"22 ounce from bottle Tony brought to talk. Cola. Fizz. Not too much going on otherwise. Fairly uneventful and lacking body.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
804,"2013-10-12",3.3,"I like this but I think that it could use a bit more malt and earthiness in the taste. The nose has some caramel and malt nut the resulting taste Id more bitter with alcohol. That being said I think its a delicious beer and that it is also easy drinking and smooth all the way around.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
804,"2013-09-25",3.2,"Shared bomber poured to snifters, displaying a ruby highlighted, dark brown tone, with quickly disappearing, brownish tan, bubbly head foam, and light spots of fading lacing at best. The nose was some malty sweetness as treacle & prune, banana, & spice as clove, with hints of toastiness & cocoa. The flavors were similar, as I detected an addition note of vanilla bean? in the taste, with low hop bitterness, and good effervescence. Not the most harmonious blend of Dunkel notes imo, but tasty nonetheless.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
804,"2013-08-26",3.7,"Sampled at esbls. Dark brown. Chocolate malts with wheat, yeast. And dark fruits. Tasty.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
804,"2013-08-22",3.1,"Bottle. Pours brown with no head. Nose and taste of clove, wheat malt, banana, cocoa, anise, grain and slightly herbal. Lighter medium body. Mouth feel is a little thin.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
804,"2013-08-22",3.5,"from a large bottle poured in a chalice. Pours cola black with no little head. Aroma is thin and anise. Flavor is smooth, somewhat herbal, and lighter mouthfeel than I expected. Not bad however not incredibly interesting either.","Illinois, USA","drdisque"
804,"2013-08-17",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 26, 2016 From Provinence? Nice banana clove, chocolately thing going on. Nice stuff. As it warms it gets a bit sweet and slippery texture. Serving: Bottle","Chicago, Illinois, USA","rubbishystuff"
804,"2013-07-24",3.5,"Bottle and served in my Ayinger Hefe glass: Pours a mahogany hue with a small head but plenty of bubbles, no lace. The aroma has notes of clove, banana, caramel, dark bread, slightly earthy and fair amount of noble grassy hops. Moderate to strong phenolics action on the nose. The taste is lightly sweet, plenty of Munich malt notes along with standard weizen yeast character of banana and clove. Faint hop bitterness and a touch of dark fruit plummy like twang. The mouth feel is lightly oily and soft. Overall not a bad beer but sort of a been there done that sort of thing. I would drink again if need be.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
804,"2013-07-14",3.3,"Bomber. Murky brown, little in the way of head. Nose is big malt, not much else. Mouth is medium bodied, sweet-ish and chock full of (in no particular order) banana, clove, bubblegum, and malt, Fuck conventions... This aint Germany, Im a beer drinker not a festival judge, or a fucking Ciceronian snoot, and  godammit, I like this one. Drink it and shut up.","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"
804,"2013-06-27",3.2,"It pours a reddish broun with a slow-forming quickly-dissipating tannish head. Unfortunately terrible for the style. SMell is phenolic with some banana, hint of roast. Flavor is smooth with bread and roasted malt, a good bit of banana, some toastiness, and lemon. The flavor is surprisingly good but not paramount for the style. It is definitely oversweet and a bit too phenolic and the rest of the beer is extremely flawed for the style but it is a decent beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
804,"2013-06-22",3.5,"22oz bottle. Pours a rich chocolately brown with a small tan head. Aroma of chocolate, banana, pineapple, touches of clove and spice. Flavor is lots of chocolate, toffee and caramel. Plenty of banana and bubblegum notes from the yeast. Interesting. Medium bodied. Finishes with lots of yeast notes.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
