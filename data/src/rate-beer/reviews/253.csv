253,"2016-08-05",2.6,"Honey nose, with subtle koji and airplane glue notes. Crystal clear, yellowish hue. Little initial flavor, but caramel and mild koji and melon appears later. Watery, warm. Inoffensive and super clean, but not a lot of complexity","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
253,"2016-06-30",3.3,"300 ml bottle. Pours clear. Taste of rice, fruit and some citrus. Nice aroma of pear, citrus and rice. Has a nice body. Overall, pretty good. The pear and citrus add something to it, but still remains a good sake.","Lander, Wyoming, USA","scooterbub"
253,"2016-01-26",3.0,"Bottle shared by bhensonb. Looks like water, smells like watermelon. The rice is prominent in the flavor with a bit of fruitiness and a very bitter finish.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
253,"2016-01-23",3.2,"Bottle from Bine & Vine.Pours like clear water. For me the aroma suggests greenish melon. Rather ""medium"" body. Flavor is clean with melon notes. Mostly for me theres not a lot of flavor, unless its ""rice"". The heat hardly burns. This is very smooth.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

253,"2013-02-16",1.9,"I cant believe the high ratings on this sake. The bottle drew me in, but I was really disappointed by everything else. The nose is strangely lemony, but in an artificial way, like a cleaning fluid of some sort. The taste follows the nose, but with a hit of alcohol, which makes it taste even more like some sort of solvent with a lemon scent. The palate is too thin. Its drinkable, but only barely. Id never buy one again. I couldnt stop thinking of watered down bleach or other cleaning fluids with artificial lemon scents.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","Inebelation"
253,"2012-12-26",3.2,"Overpriced great name wonderful for beginners - pretty bottle and tasty but this will go from being your favorite to your least- hakutsuru is almost half the cost , get it cold and its far superior.  Still much love for this bottle it opened my eyes.","North Carolina, USA","asg123"
253,"2012-06-30",3.2,"Some apple cider, grape, and a sour funk in the aroma.  Flavor is mildly sweet, with some light fruit.  Alcohol and a little acidic bitterness in the finish.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","annunz123"
253,"2012-06-18",2.9,"It pours transparent with just the slightest tint of yellow. The aroma has notes of: pear, apple, and alcohol. The taste is light sweet that finishes medium acidic; there are notes of: apples, black-pepper, alcohol, and a slight almond finish. The palate is light-medium bodied, thin, and a medium finish. Overall an overly delicate Junmai; seems restrained. Im sure traditionalists are squealing, but Im unimpressed.","Ontario, CANADA","chris__hartley"

253,"2011-07-05",3.1,"Bottle. Strong nose of fruit with a touch of boozy or medicinal acidity. Pours almost transparent. Flavor is sharp but good, with more fruit without any sweetness. Finishes clean, but a little short. Good.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"
253,"2009-10-03",2.9,"Bottle: Pours a clear color with good legs. The nose is light and acidic with some basic koji notes. The body is noticeably thin and lacking umami, more on the acidic and dry side too. Looking at where this falls on the sake meter, I should have known I wouldnt like it, but its fun to try this entry level and/or ""premium sake for heating"" types. Lightly chilled straight, meh.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
253,"2009-09-20",3.3,"This bottled sake from a restaurant poured a head of clear colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a transparent uncarbonated body and no lacing. The smooth aroma was vinous polished rice. The semi-thick mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a mild alcohol burning vinous aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of somewhat unpolished rice.  A decent one that I would consider buying again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

253,"2009-03-14",3.8,"Crushed with Jakebra and Honkeybra at random.  One hell of a kick.  Cannot imagine drinking much more of this.  Nice and light fruits, and the alcohol warms my tummy in a nice way.  Liked it.","Colorado, USA","That1Guy"
253,"2009-02-22",3.6,"Bottle dated 11/08, 300 ml, purchased at Whole Foods in Georgetown on Wisconsin Ave. NW. Pours crystal clear. Aroma is floral and fruity (plum, pears, berries). Flavor is soft, fruity, floral, grainy as well. Fairly well blended. The alcohol warms but isnt overpowering or too harsh. This is non-offensive and would be great to serve to someone who has never had sake before.","Washington DC, USA","zebracakes"
253,"2009-02-16",3.6,"(300 ml bottle (stamped ""06/08"") from Belfast Co-op, served lightly chilled) Pours mostly clear with just a hint of yellow/gold. Aroma of rice, sweetness, alcohol and light fruit (cherry/pineapple/peach). Mouthfeel smooth, light and a bit dry toward the finish. Some droplets and legs on the inside of the glass. Flavor of fermented rice, lightly bready with a nice light fruity touch. Fairly hot but not overpowering. Seems better cooler than warmer, maybe due to the fruity notes.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"
253,"2008-12-30",3.9,"Slight yellow/green color. Aroma is melons and some white wine. Flavor is also mostly melons, with some wine and alcohol.","Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA","zathrus13"
253,"2008-12-14",3.5,"Poured clear yellow.  Aroma was melon, and maybe a bit of citrus.  Flavor was super smooth.  No detectable alcohol at all really.  Flavor was a bit on the mellow side, but this sake had some nice things going for it.  Good stuff.","Greenbelt, Maryland, USA","ApisAles"
253,"2008-10-31",3.5,"Clear.  Big flower and honeydew melon aroma.  Light, sweet honey up front, drifting into a floral and slightly fruity body.  Dry finish.  Very nice.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

253,"2008-04-06",3.4,"Pale yellow body with some nice long lasting legs. The aroma is musty and earthy with some dandelions and sweat. There is also some short bread cookie. The taste is light vanilla with some pears. There is also a little bit of sugar cookie sweetness to the finish. This is warming and the alcohol burn is pleasant.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
253,"2008-02-11",3.6,"Nose has a bit of grape, and possibly anise?  Slightly creamy texture with some pepper, floral and herbal notes.  Extremely drinkable, did very well with pickled ginger on my palate.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","dmtroyer"
253,"2008-01-31",2.5,"Clean, smooth, very non-threatening with any strange or unique flavors. This is the sake that one would have after a hard of work and comes home to a nice simple dinner.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
253,"2008-01-31",2.3,"The aroma is mostly rice and alcohol and very clean. The appearance is clear. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is watery. This is about the cleanest sake I have had.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
253,"2007-11-08",3.5,"Bottle from Jungle Jims served cold. Poured clear pale color with good legs. Medium melon rice alcohol aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Medium complex tangy flavor with a medium sweet alcohol finish that was of moderate duration. Solid drinkable sake.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
253,"2007-10-31",4.1,"On tap at Holiday Wine Cellars Wine/Sake tasting bar.  Cool!  Room temperature.  Clear maybe with slightest cloudiness hint.  Mild aroma, almost of a chardonnay.  Very nice aroma.  Taste leans a hair sweet.  Extremely drinkable.  Alchohol present, but in a pleasant way.  Makes me want to buy a bottle.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
253,"2007-10-30",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2007 300 ml bottle from City Market in Burlington, VT (October 2007), served chilled from a White Winter Winery glass.  Quite clear, just a faint hint of yellow/green to keep it from watery clarity; a bit oily/translucent with a faint film in the glass as it disappears; still.....gorgeous aroma of melon (honeydew), dogwood, vanilla and a bit of caramel; no alcohol apparent in the nose....a bit of booze does come through on the tongue, but the overall flavor profile is quite mild and delicate, with a hint of vanilla, again, light fruitiness, a touch of cocoa powder, perhaps a bourbony hint....finishes rather dry, lightly bitter-peppery, moderately alcoholic....very nice and the smooth, light character of the body makes it for me a little more quaffable than the nigoris Ive had before this, my first junmai. Might be my favorite sake thus far.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
253,"2007-10-12",3.3,"Much thicker than water but just as clear, this brew has a floral aroma with a touch of sweet melon and some fresh grasses.  Theres an actual taste of rice, something I havent found in many Sakes that Ive tried.  The fruitiness is maintained and it has a dash of pepper.  The alcohol, although strong, maintains a very quiet presence throughout.  Decent.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?
