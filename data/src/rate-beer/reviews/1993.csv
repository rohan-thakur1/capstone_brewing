1993,"2017-05-09",3.8,"Originally rated on 12/31/08. The brewers description of this as part scotch ale, IPA, and brown ale is pretty accurate.

1993,"2017-04-28",3.5,"12oz bottle picked up at The Ale Jail in St. Paul. Consumed in a spiegelau IPA glass. Amber/brown in color with a light tan head. Aroma has traits of hops with toffee, caramel, and an almost cookie like characteristic. Taste has qualities of molasses with toffee and brown sugar. Notes of coffee almost come through which was a little bit unexpected. There is a bitterness present especially at the finish with a residual bit of sugar. Really a strange blend of a lighter coffee stout and a traditional Dogfish Head IPA. Mouthfeel is slightly thin but has some minor oily characteristics. Something a little too unbalanced in this effort for my taste. Pretty decent for a brown ale.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"

1993,"2017-04-14",3.7,"7.2%ABV. IPA.

Poured out dark brown. 32ºSRM.

Nose is dank and moist and nutty and suggesting boiled peanuts. Freshly roasted chestnuts. Maybe hint of wet tobacco leaf.

Mouthfeel is nutty and drip coffee. Palate is Folgers drip coffee with smoky, slightly sour, bitter, but light without the intensity of serious carmelization. Hops are almost resinous. There is slightly sour middle-hind palate that suggests lemon peel or grapefruit peel with a slightly oily character suggesting citrus oil, which is both tangy but also with a lingering aromatic component to it.

Finish is medium long with charcoal, resin, sap.

Overall, would not characterize this as a hoppy brown. The only brown ale component comes through most obviously in the nose and the hind palate with some nutty, dark barley toast like flavors, but over all the OBVIOUS flavor notes are charcoal, burnt twigs, burnt coffee beans of a stout and the aromatics of an IPA.","SINGAPORE","drjoeng"

The taste is like a suckerpunch to the head after the good smell. Sour. Very light body, overly carbonated. Taste has some coffee that was left on the burner all night, sour red fruits kind of riding over everything. Is that the ginger or is it a bad bottle? This is pretty awful. Bad surprise.

Medium carbonation, but didnt produce that much of a head. I cant stop sipping it! The flavors are outstanding, mainly sweet, but with a slight hoppy aftertaste. Thinking of the Rolling Stones song, ""Brown Sugar"", as that is the main theme going on here. Its almost like a stout. Aroma is oak mixed with the sweets of the malts and sugar. Reminds me of a toned down, affordable version of the DFH Immort Ale, which is like 11% vs. 7.2% here. They only had one left at the local retailer, but Ill be looking out for more of this in the future.
UPDATE: Bottled on 11/29/07 (sampled on 6/12/09)........Bought a 6-pack of this after loving the first single/sample I tried. I didnt really notice this until I drank the 4th one, that this may have aged a bit too long. Had a bit more of a sour taste, where that sweet balanced taste I liked maybe had fermented too much. I did notice the hops a little more though, which I guess is a good thing. Still tasted good and sweet, and was totally drinkable, just didnt seem how I preferred it before.

Very pretty brown color with a light tan head of foam. Tastes roasty, slightly hoppy and sweet. Has a lot in common with a scotch ale but has more brown sugar, rather than malt sweetness. Has an interesting creme brûlée quality about it. This was good; I feel it is a bit overrated. Perhaps the brown ale category isn't packed with great beers so this one dominates.

Medium to dark copper & clear with a light, tan brown head thats slightly foamy & about a 0.5cm tall with little initial movement.

Sweet & nutty with sugar & caramel coming through. Medium strength malts are there with hints of hops giving the beer a definite American style aroma. Darker fruits/raisins with some further sweetness, hints of chocolate & light bitterness come through as well.

Malty with plenty of hops & even some citrus. Some nutty flavours come through too with sweetness & caramel with some darker fruits too. Definitely not what I was expecting but a very nice taste with some roasted flavours, plenty of chocolate & faint bitterness towards the end as well.

Medium bodied, quite sweet on the palate with a sticky smooth feel that goes down with only a faint hint of alcohol showing. Carbonation was about medium with this one as well and the balance was a good one with the hops & malts working well together from the start.

1993,"2014-06-11",4.3,"Reviewed from notes. 
Ive had this in pint glasses and a couple times in tulips. Its always the same. 
The appearance was a nice dark brown color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipates within about a minute and left some light semi - thick lacing in its wake. 
The smell was awesome as it had a super nice allocation of the Scottish peat - like smokey/roasty malts to the engraving bittersweet citrus hops to delightfully entice my nose to partake in more whiffs to get some light roasty caramel nuttiness about it.
The taste replicates the smell pretty much exactly the same.
On the palate, this one sits about a medium. The carbonation seems appropriately made for the style and shows a decent smoothness about it.
Overall, what an absolutely amazing beer - three styles in one and well done. Makes me want to move back East.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1993,"2014-05-18",4.2,"From BA review on 2-5-12 - 
Poured from bottle into pint glass.

Appearance  Pours a deep-brown color. Upon pouring there is a billowy tan head which forms which slowly fades over time to produce some nice lacing and a very thin persistent foam film on the top of the brew.

Smell  A huge caramel aroma meets the nose. While overwhelming at first, it gives away a bit, revealing aromas of roasty malt and a bit of nuttiness and some alcohol.

Taste  A semi-sweet malt flavor first hits, which seems to sweeten over time giving way to a very caramely flavor and some brown sugar. A roasted malt flavor with nice toasted nut and a little bit of of coffee flavors round out the taste, leaving a rather satisfying taste in the mouth.

Mouthfeel  The thicker body suits this beer quite nice. Mixed with the slightly linger carbonation it allows the brew to linger on the tongue; creating a very nice mouthfeel. 

Overall  This is one very nice beer. While not the most potent, the sweet maltiness mixed with the thicker mouthfeel and roasty flavor make this a great brew to sit and sip slowly over a relaxing evening.","","Darkmagus82"

While I despise the IPA label being reassigned to any hoppy beer from red to brown, I am willing to forgive Dogfish Head both due to their brewing excellence and the fact that despite the pale in IPA it historically most likely resembled the blood-red brown of this beer, Carmel-colored with thick head and dark lace. Alcohol, dark berries, and earthy hops in the nose, thick and slightly-cloying mouthfeel with rich malt, alcohol esters, and back-tongue bitterness in the middle, and eatery-fruity malt and satisfying bitterness at the end, finishing in malt rather than citrus or astringent. Excellent example of a historical IPA, regardless of label.","","BeerTrek"

Quite a pungent aroma; treacle, dark brown sugar, wholemeal bread dough, roast malt huskiness, chocolate, touch of espresso even.
Full bodied yet much leaner than abv would suggest. Reasonably lively carbonation.
Palate continues with dry burnt caramel notes, husky chocolate malt graininess, bit of spiciness (rye?), hint of hop citrus. Moderate bitterness to finish, lingering husky maltiness.

1993,"2014-01-15",3.7,"Bottle from Gendarmenmarkt Berlin. Brown, coarsely foam, with an almost black, ember color.

Bitter chocolate, burned malts, toffee, almost stoutlike aromas. 

Malty beginning, hints of sweet toffee soon overwhelmed by a more breadish taste of malt going along with a sligthly sweetened chocolate. Hoppy bitterness brings in even more complexity, goes well along with the upcoming coffee flavor. Kicks in late, gives the malt aromas much time to develop. Bitterness adds a floral taste to the beer, which pairs up well with the malty body which dominates throughout.
Coffee aftertaste is very present, staying long on the tongue. Surprisingly it isnt very bitter, but leaving a smooth dry mouthfeel.
This is a very interesting and enjoyable beer, reminds me somehow of the ""Schumacher 1838er"", while being a little more aggressive on the hops.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Poured into a snazzy DFH pint. 

A: Not much of a hop profile on the nose, but an interesting combination of dark malts and dark fruits. Some coffee notes with a Lilliputian bitter cocoa note. 
A: Pours a crisp dark brown with a tan head that fades into some nice lacing. 
T: This beer is very complex. There are chocolate notes, but it is not a sweet beer. Its a bitter beer, but not over-whelming due to the progression of the hop profile. The finish is a malty/creamy finish. 
P: Very creamy with just a bit of hops for this smooth, medium bodied beer.

1993,"2013-09-17",3.1,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a very dark chestnut color. The head is a two finger mocha shade. It has a wonderfully soft texture, and as it fades away, leaves behind plenty of lacing on the glass.

S: I dont really pick up a ton of hops...at first. Theres a pleasant wave of brown sugar, nuts, and chocolate at first. Hops build up as it unravels in the glass, revealing both piny and herbal qualities. Maybe even a touch of mint. I must say, the hops are VERY well integrated within the maltier aspects of the aroma.

T: Aye...this is a bit of a letdown next to the nose. Subdued hops open this up - providing notes of grapefruit, mint, and pine - and roll all the way to the back end, being propped up by caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and faint chocolate. This malt backbone builds up on the finish, slowly but gradually. My problem here is that it seems like a cross between a boring IPA and a boring brown ale - it hybridizes the two styles well enough, but comes off blandly. When people rag on balanced brews, this is exactly what theyd rag on. Actually, come to think of it, since its too sweet, that would make it imbalanced...

M: It finishes rather sweet, and unfortunately, the hops dont really dry it out as much as Id like. Even worse, it lacks the creaminess I like out of most sweetish brews. For that reason, its hard to drink. On the plus side, theres no remote hint of harshness in the feel.

O: Its not a bad beer. Nor is it interesting, complex, or subtly executed. Basically this is just another average brown ale, only with a hint of hops. I say its well worth a try for those who like this style, but I wont be back for this one.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

1993,"2013-03-20",3.4,"Appearance: Pours a dark, deep brown color with a small, tan head. The lacings pretty good at the beginning.

Smell: Smells like youd expect it to after its been in a bottle for so long. Mild malt notes, but a sour, vinegar-like trunk smell is there as well. Not an overpowering smell... quite muted. I would certainly expect a fresh batch to smell a lot more pleasant.

Taste/feel: Tastes about as good as a 17 month old beer should be able to. Its drinkable, has a very nice and deep malty/coffee aftertaste. The hops seem to be almost completely gone in the taste and aroma, and it just drinks like a heavy brown ale ... almost like a porter or a stout with the super rich aftertaste. The feels pretty decent. Low carbonation and somewhat creamy. Not bad.

Overall, hard to accurately score this one due to the sheer age of this beer. Regardless of its age, it tastes better than a lot of beers do fresh. Id definitely try this again either on tap or out of a fresher bottle.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

The roasty characteristics continue into the taste. Some dark chocolate and coffee along with roasted barley. The dark fruit is more predominant with figs and some licorice. There is a little bit of tartness in the mouthfeel along with a breath of alcohol in the finish. Bitterness is light to moderate.

Strong notes of coffee, toffee, toast, and brown sugar dominate the malt side, but are balanced by a significant hop presence. The beer is a clear deep brown with some interesting highlighting throughout. The taste balances the malt notes from the aroma with dome rasins and then full hop development.

dissipates quickly, looks almost black. A good wiff of malt and some light hops. The

the hop bite, and finishes with a dry, alcohol like
flavor. Medium bodied, not too thick or syrupy.
Goes down pretty clean. I'm a complete hophead and not a huge fan
of brown ales, but their description inspired me to
give it a try. Definitely one of my favorite browns so
far, but the hop addict in me would like to see a little
more bite and the end (like Sweetwater's Imperial

1993,"2012-03-13",3.9,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/26/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a DFH signature tulip.

Indian Brown pours an almost black mahogany color with a few ruby highlights. A full tan head bubbles up initially into a sea foam froth consistency, but a small foamy film maintains for the entire glass. Specks of lace dot the glass.

There are a few different things going on in the nose. Sweet brown sugar and caramel malt notes are fairly sweet, roasted malt provides some cocoa flavors as well, and there are some bitter earthy notes to close it out.

The flavor also tilts toward the malty end of the spectrum. Some caramel sweetness mixed with toasted grains, some light cocoa, and a bit of peat start out. Although there is a sweetness present, it does not dominate. The flavor turns to a bit of burnt brown sugar, peat, cofffe, and some earthy notes in the middle. Toward the end, the earthy notes turn bitter and pick up a bit of citrus for some further bitterness. 

For the style, this definitely has a nice, rich, full body. Creamy and smooth carbonation enhance the pleasant taste experience.

1993,"2011-12-10",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 14, 2012 For some reason I didnt want to like this, but I did, very much so. I dont care what you call itscotch, Indian, brown, this is quite a beer. The initial aromatic assault is mostly of notes derived from the dark maltscoffee beans, toffee, chocolate, burnt caramel (in a good way) and molassesalmost like a lesser stout. The taste is more hop-oriented, with a grassy feel to it, but very good. Very pleasant and all-around good beer.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

Of course, adding brown sugar to the recipe tends to do that, or at least, thats what Im told.  The use of ""India"" in the title is a bit misleading, since this bottle isnt that hoppy for a regular brown, much less an IBA.  A deep, roasted sweetness steals the show from the lackadaisical hops, but, strangely enough, such rampant sweetness doesnt overstay its welcome, nor does it grow cloy.

1993,"2011-04-22",3.5,"12 oz bottle from Premier Gourmet in Buffalo, bottled September 16, 2010, served in a snifter. Pours clear chestnut with a small, dense tan head. The head fades to a thin remnant and leaves minimal lace. The nose has a rich, nutty roasted malt quality with generous earth and hops. The flavour is moderately sweet throughout with lots of brown sugar and a nutty-boozy-fruity quality with a delicate herbal hoppiness towards the finish. The finish is moderate in length and hoppy. On the palate, it is medium-full in body with a smooth, milky texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a nice strong brown ale but not as hoppy as I remember. I suspect that some of the hops have retreated a bit as it aged. Definitely worth another try with a fresh bottle. 2011-04-21","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

App.:  Deep brown-black (barely translucent) with a fair tan head.

Palate:  Medium+ body, moderately prickly effervescence.
  
Flav.:  Peppery, pine hops notes, a little resinous, the malts are there, but quite restrained and more stern, a slight grape note, a bit of alcohol, a little black coffee; dry with fair bitterness and a dusty, pine/leafy hop finish with some mouth-coating dark malts.

1993,"2011-02-26",4.0,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a Dogfish Head football-shaped tumbler.Appearance: Dark ruby red body - not completely opaque but translucent. Pretty color. A liberal pour produces a thick, tan, creamy/frothy head which retains very well and leaves good lacing on the glass.Smell: Such a complex nose for a beer of this caliber: smoke, dark chocolate, light hop flowers and brown sugar. Taste: The brewerys official description indicates its a hybrid of scotch ale, brown ale and IPA and I would totally agree with that and perhaps add a fourth style - stout. Theres a lot going on with this beer and yet it doesnt hit your palate like a ton of bricks. The first half is somewhat mild and sweet with brown sugar and light flowers. The second half is very smokey and woody with a coffee-like, dry bitterness. There even seems to be a dairy-like element found in milk stouts. Its amazing a beer can be simultaneously sweet and hoppy - what an achievement!Mouthfeel: Quite soft, but not as thin as most brown ales. A little intense as colder temperatures, but calms down as it warms.Drinkability: This is a beer where the statistics lie. Theres no way this beer is 7.2% ABV! It drinks like a traditional brown ale - smooth, quaffable and sessionable. This is definitely one of the most versatile beers on the mainstream craft beer market. The sweetness makes it a good dessert brew, but the hoppiness enables it to stand up to a red meat dinner.Overall, an really good beer bordering on a great beer. It doesnt quite knock my socks off the way an upper echelon beer might, but its probably the best good beer I can think of.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoXE7-MyXT0","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Rich and tempting chocolate aroma with coffee hints.  The flavours dominated by so much brown sugar that it reminds me of a Belgian beer (Achel 8?).  But theres some chocolate-coated raisins too and a twist of lemon (from the Goldings?).  The burnt malt bitterness lingering menacingly in the background alternates between balancing the sweetness and clashing with it.  From a messy beginning, it pulled itself together by the end and I quite enjoyed it, but the carbonation didnt work with the viscous mouthfeel.","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","wheresthepath"

S- Very Dark Roasted and malty in smell. The Roast smell is very sweet,like coffee, brown sugar comes to mind due to some molasses smell that is detectable as well. Also a small hint of some floral hops in the back.

T- The roast flavour is very intense, just like a good cup of dark coffee. The Sweet flavour is also very detectable, the brown sugar/molasses is perfectly balanced with the coffee taste. Only a litte taste of hops are there, but theyre not heavily flavoured and definitely do not overpower the malts. Very in heavy in the mouth, also slightly creamy.

1993,"2010-09-29",4.5,"All I can say is wow!  After pouring this beer the aroma was amazing and intoxicating. The malt and barley came right out and almost smacks you in the face.  An unbelievable smell, but I wish that it lasted longer.  As great as it was, it almost disappears just as you are enjoying it.  As you swirl the beer it has brief re-appearances, but sadly fades away.  The look to this beer was nice with a charcoal clear black color to it.  If this is their brown ale, I wonder what their stout or porter looks like.  The head was a light brown that looked very creamy mostly lasting.  First tasting this beer a hint of caramelized sweetness comes out with a touch of a burnt charcoal to it.  The finish was quite pleasant with a heavier bitter flavor along with that charcoal hint towards the end that had a long lasting impression.  The feel in the mouth was also quite impressive as it had this very nice creamy texture that was full bodied and soft carbonation.  The finish at the end was surprisingly smooth and then faded to the lasting finishing flavor at the end.  As far as chugging this beer, I would stray away from, as well as perhaps not the beer of choice on a hot day for refreshment.  That being said this beer is the kind I would have with dinner, on a date, at a bar, or sitting at home relaxing.  A beer that screams sophistication and flavor.

There is an ashen note which again reminds me of a London porter, and in turn puts me in mind of that Saturday afternoon pub aroma.  The mouth feel is medium thin with a soft carbonation; the mid-range alcohol content is nowhere to be found.  On the finish the barley grows pronounced.

1993,"2010-08-20",4.0,"Aroma: Very earthy and nutty, with hints of chocolate and bread malts.

Appearance: This is a beautiful beer. It is almost as dark as a porter.  This is not a very heady beer, but the small layer there is appears very frothy and is a quite dark tan color.

Taste: The taste is roasty and earthy. The chocolate malts are prominent as well as the roasted flavour of the malts, most often present in a porter. Resembles a lighter version of Samuel Smiths Taddy Porter.

Palate: The body is somewhere between medium and full, while the texture is creamy and thick. There is an average amount of carbonation, just enough not to hide any of the rich flavor. A slight bitterness is revealed toward the finish.

Pours a deep, murky brown with a modest cream colored head that recedes slowly and laces decently.

Aroma is of caramel malts and deep roast. Slightly sour aroma o yeast like a flanders or traditional porter. Coffee, nutty and malty, taking each sniff makes my mouth water.

Flavor is dark roasted malt, nutty and roasty. Burnt meat and slightly smokey flavors come out. Sourness comes in the middle with a punch of sweetness. Maltiness overpowers at the finish and there is a slight bitterness there which takes more like from the roast than any hops.

Mouthfeel is creamy full and lush with soft carbonation. Slightly slick with a little stick left on the left.

1993,"2010-08-07",3.1,"I must confess that I was disappointed by this beer.  When I poured the bottle into my glass, I was encouraged by the beautiful colour in the glass, but when I put the beer to my nose, I was shocked by how little aroma I actaully got.  When I tasted the beer, I have to say that the flavour that was there was, in fact, quite pleasant.  The unfortunate thing was that there simply wasnt enough of it!  

I had been expecting a much fuller mouthfeel -- in fact, I cant recall a beer with over 7%abv. tasting this thin!  I was looking for a richer, toastier beer - not a stout, mind you, just more body - and also found the hop character a bit lacking.  In my opinion, this beer needs more muscle and further hopping.  

The biggest flaws with this beer, in my opinion are the thinness of the mouthfeel and the very short finish.  

After all of this negativity, I will say that this beer was not all bad.  I will aknowledge that it is possible I am being a little harsher on this beer because it is brewed by Dogfish Head than if it came from elsewhere.  The problem is that I have gained such a respect for them over the years, anything that I feel is ""under the bar"" is a sore disappointment.","IRELAND","DMarra"

A: The ale is a dark mahogany color, so deep red that appears black from afar. A very tall rocky and persistent tan head. Excellent lacing.

A: Highly aromatic. The nose is malty, thick with a smoky undertone that drips with peat and alcohol-soaked cherries. Caramel malts add further heft to the body.

T: A balanced smoky brown beer. Darker malts, toasted with chocolate, coffee and caramel, lead the way. They are followed almost immediately with a palpable smoky flavor. The result is thick and almost coarse brew. Hop flavor manages to peak through the malts and smoke but just barely. A very enjoyable drink.

P: The mouthfeel is full, smoky and thick, but not so heavy that it is burdensome. I was edxpecting a run of the mill brown ale but, knowing DFH, I should have known otherwise. Finish is fairly dry.

1993,"2010-03-15",3.8,"12 oz. bottle. Pours dark amber brown. Smells of barley, molasses malt, and hops. Flavor comes in stages. Upon first sip, there is a brief hit of sweet brown sugar that foreshadows a later stage. Becomes immediately bitter with notes of barley grain and ginger. Morphs into a boozy caramel flavor. Then develops distinct notes of brown sugar as the boozy character subsides. At some points, there are small hints of coffee amid the molasses (a bit in the aftertaste as well). The finish is a return to the bitter. A solid beer.","Oxford, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Shakesbeere"

1993,"2010-02-27",4.1,"Another success from Dogfish Head!  Had it on tap at the 9:30 Club for a GREAT Cage the Elephant show. (shameless plug, but it was the best show Ive seen there).
Anyways, the beer.  Nutty goodness. Had a very british taste to it.  IT looked nice with a deep dark muddy brown color with an ugly dark creamy bubbly head (though not a very big head).  Had some coffee and chocolate flavors almost like a stout, a touch of caramel, some nuttiness.  An all around good beer. It wasnt that it was amazingly complex (which it was fairly complex) it was that had a little of a few different styles so it was just different and unique.  For that you have to give it good marks.  although it makes it tough to place within a category.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","KUEric"

Well put together Brown Ale, though it really reminded me more of a coffee stout than a true Brown.  As far as their line goes, this falls somewhere in the middle, but for a lineup as impressive as theirs, that is still saying a lot.  Not much more to say other than Id drink it again.

1993,"2010-02-06",3.9,"12 oz. bottle- Pours brownish black with a pour I had to rigorously pour just to get a quarter inch head, aroma is of light caramel malt and coffee. The flavor is weird, a hoppy-malty brown ale. Experimental as usual from this brewery, the question is did it work. I think it did because it tastes good, and that is the most important part of the structure of a beer. You can be experimental as hell but if it tastes like shit, you have a shitty beer. They blended hops and malt perfectly to make a well balanced hoppy brown ale.","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"

The aroma was heavy of a toasted caramel malt, a mild resin hop and a moderate scent of a leathery yeast with a nice rich roasted coffee note. 

It tasted mildly sweet, malty and slightly bitter with just a hint of caramel and coffee at first and finished with a nice dark bitter coffee flavor that lasted a nice long time.

Lots of different malty flavors that tasted good on the palate.  Almost a liquor flavor with some caramel and maybe coffee tastes; but NOT hot with alcohol like some high ABV beers.  The 50 IBUs is noticed in the aftertaste.  For my taste, I wish they would have moved some of the bittering hops over to the favoring boil time to catch more of the Liberty/Golding hop flavors.

1993,"2009-11-18",4.2,"A: Poured with an average-to-large sized, light brown head that slowly diminished to 1/4-finger. Body is jet-black at first glance, and therefore opaque, until I hold it up to the light... you can then see some brown hints near the top. Fair lacing left on the sides of the glass.

S: Complex aroma of slight roasted malt, bitter hops, and chocolate... lots and lots of chocolate.

T: And the chocolate is what comes through first in the taste... bitter chocolate, which leads way to the lightly bitter finish from the hops. Very interesting and enjoyable... reminds me more of a stout in many ways than your typical brown ales. I cant detect the 7%+ alcohol at all.

M: Full-bodied with a nice, creamy texture, and average carbonation bordering on the soft side.

D: This is a damn fine brew... kind of a combination of a brown ale, stout, and an IPA as well. A fantastic sipping beer.","New Brunswick, CANADA","Berley31"

Toffee, caramel, brown sugar, dark fruit, English hops - smells like a big English Brown.

Major malt explosion upfront - strong caramel, fruit and roasted notes, maybe even a slight smokiness. Bitter at the end, much more so than other Browns, with a persistent bitter aftertaste. DFH describes this as a cross between a traditional Brown, a Scotch Ale and an IPA; throw Porter or Stout into the mix (because of the roasted character) and that may be just about right. I didnt know a Brown could handle this much taste.

This is a very smooth beer with a full body and moderate carbonation. Slightly warming.

Original rating 6/23/2009: Malt and hops! The commercial description is spot on. Its like they took two different beers, a scotch ale and IPA, and mixed them together.

Mouth feel: Full body with effervescence in the back of the mouth

Overall Impression:  Great beer with big complex flavors and aroma.  This is fun beer to drink, taste and enjoy as it doesnt match any particular style.  I am in wonder to where the hops were hid.  For a 50 IBU beer I would expect the hops to be more prominent.   Its fun to try and define, yet is doesnt match any style.

RE-RATE 3/20/11 Bottle from World Market.  The beer has a smearing of different colors which is actually pretty cool.  Near the bottom of the glass is a light orange that fades to a pretty red and then towards dark brown near the top.  Quite a lovely sight indeed.  The head is a foamy tan color that sits and doesnt fade.  Great appearance.

Lots of things in the aroma too.  The first thing I notice is a sweet raisin like smell that immediately changes to a roasted coffee ground.  Coffee!  I wasnt expecting that at all.  Roasted malts and cocoa beans too.

The flavor is big roasted malts too that stay with you into the finish.  There is a sweet dark fruit flavor too, like raisins and plums.  It has a burnt bitter finish of roasted malts that dries out the palate.  Some bitter hops can be felt on the finish too.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"

1993,"2009-02-10",3.2,"I am never very impressed by any beers named for a color.  Reds, ambers, browns, blacks, they just dont do much for me.  Probably because of the lack of hops.  I do like Belgian whites though.  This brown was better than almost any I have ever had.  The aroma was sweet and full of caramel malt.  The flavor too was sweet and full of caramel with hints of brown sugar and maybe maple syrup.  Not overly sickly sweet and actually this one finished a tad bit dry with the presence of some finishing hops.  A decent beer.","Kettering, Ohio, USA","Maddog"

Solid wall of heavy lacing. Nose is a nice combination of roasty coffee, bit of caramel sweetness, molasses. Taste starts off with a dry, roasty bready note, hints of molasses and even cola sweetness, with dark fruit and molasses coming out more around mid-palate, hints of cocoa. Roasty coffee note starts to take over right before the finish, with just a hint of floral hops, and the finish is very dry and lingers fairly lightly on the palate. Mouthfeel is fairly creamy, medium bodied. Seems more like a combination of a dry porter and a brown than anything.

It’s a sweet combo that really works well with the hops. This is the only brown with any real hop flavor that I have had to date.

1993,"2008-11-27",3.8,"I would never go so far as to say that Dogfish Head is the most extreme and creative craft brewery currently in the market. I see other craft breweries put out crazy, wild, extreme, and very deliciously exciting beers. But, I would say that the difference is that off-centered ales for off-centered people is the very credo and motto upon which Dogfish Head was created and by which it still lives today. They dont release the occasional extreme brew once or twice a year; instead, every beer they release is their extreme and intensely flavored versions of that traditional style. More often than not, they do so with great success and have brought many an eye-opening experience to my lips to further spoil my tastebuds and my palate. One of their year-round offers is the Indian Brown Ale, a dark, thick, and chewy brown ale.

My Indian Brown Ale poured with a miniscule head but a hugely dense, thick, and brownish-black into my glass, daring any light to try and peek through. Immediately a rich, sweet and malty nose wafts my way with huge notes of chocolate, molasses, and caramelized sugars. A faint earthen finish hints of wood barrels and smoke. Though she had little head to speak of, she does swirl and poof upon command, leaving traces of lace to mark her territory. My first quaff is thick and lusciously sweet with a mouth-sticking viscosity which proudly represents the thick pour and nose I had just previously basked in. Sweet and smooth milk chocolate greets me first, followed by a procession of fresh nuts, molasses, brown sugars, and some warm smoked wood notes. As she warms, she bitters up a bit with more prominent hints of darker chocolates and coffee. I definitely recommend enjoying the Indian Brown Ale after she has had a few minutes to settle into room temperature versus refrigerator temperature. For such a heavy brown ale, she maintains a very balanced palate which finishes pleasantly dry with faint chocolate esters.

An excellent heavy brown ale with a solid personality, she backs down for no one person or critic. She is meant to be sipped and savored, though that minor fact wouldnt keep me from enjoying a couple at a time. Even though the Indian Brown Ale came long before the Palo Santo Marron, I can see the faint beginnings of the inspiration which led brewmaster and founder Sam Calagione to the Palo Santo. I hear some very rare wood was also involved, but that is a store for another time. Once more, I tip my hat to Dogfish Head in respectful satisfaction.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"
1993,"2008-11-20",4.1,"Pours a very deep dark dark brown with a nice tan head. There is a bit of lacing throughout.

Smell is of burnt malts mostly with a bit of hops.

Taste is initially burnt malt followed by hop bitterness. After the bitterness fades away the caramelized sugar speaks through and further develops in the finish.

The mouthfeel is full, more so than I expected an a bit much for a brown. Not necessarily a bad thing though.

This is a mighty brown ale. If I could name it I would call it an Imperial Brown Ale. The stronger alcohol and hop presence makes this a truly unique brew. Not typical of the style, but very flavorful and rather complex. Definitely recommended.

Flavor is roast, smores-lots of chocolate, toast, chocolate, sweet malts, and marshmallows-toast, lots of graham and a little coffee. Finish is sweet with lots of coffee/roast malts, chocolate,and a little bitterness. The thing I like about this beer is that the hop character may play a back seat to the huge maltiness but the malts are full and beyond rich while letting the hops establish a slight bitter balance-the balance is fantastic. Finish is all roast, toast, and chocolate; with the slightly bitter hop character playing second fiddle. I would recomend this beer to anyone wishing to find a highly desirable beer for the masses. Palate is medium to thick and perfectly carbonated to set the scene for the huge character for the beer.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

The sweetness might turn some off but 2 bottles of this is easily doable.  Mouthfeel is the only thing that brings this beer back to earth.

Pours a deep, dark, mohogany/brown with a finger-width, fizzy, chocolate tan head that dissipates slowly, but doesnt linger too long. Leaves a nice and decent lacing on the glass. Smell is extremely potent. Not too complex, but a ton of aroma! Lots of sweet caramel malts, loads of brown sugar, nutty, molasses. Also, some roasted malts and bitter hops. One of the hoppier brown ales out there. I absolutely love this smell. A real mellow and soft body. Kind of watery, but really smooth. This brown ale brings a lot of taste to the table. Loaded with nutty and caramel malts. Really rich. Good amount of citrus hops add to the character really well. Some hints of roast, brown sugar, chocolate, molasses. Finishes with a dry bitterness that lingers for a very long time. Lots of taste still there even a couple minutes later. Overall, I have never been a real brown ale fan, but dogfish head continues to put out amazing beers and changes my mind about everything. This brown ale has opened me up to trying more and giving the genre a second chance. I am thoroughly impressed with this highly balanced and tasteful brew.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Its of raisins and burnt sugar, with a hint of alcohol, and some great maltiness on the finish.

I was slightly put off by my first bottle, but after enjoying the remaining bottles over a week plus It did eventually grow on me. And abrupt, in your face aroma of burnt toast, coffee, cream, and roasted nuts hits you immediately. There is also a strong noble hop presence. Rich brown color with a deep red tint. A billowing tan head that ultimately settles leaving a stream of heavy lacing. Heavy on the palate, very bitter with a rolling creaminess. Assertive flavor that slaps your face before it settles down. Burnt malts that are both nutty and sweet. Bitter coffee and floral noble hops. Dark chocolate with brown sugar. Gritty and abrasive, this beer needs time to be enjoyed. Not an everyday choice for me, but once a year should do the trick.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"

Flavor starts out with strong, citrusy west-coast hops, soon followed by coffee malts (the provided description of being a cross between a Scotch Ale, IPA, and APA is quite accurate).  Not my cup of tea (beer?) at all; while the component flavors are all nice, they do not blend together well, and the overall effect is somewhat revulsive.","Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA","TOSG55"
1993,"2008-08-04",3.6,"8/04/2008:  Indian Brown Ale has clear brown color with smooth carbonation and a creamy whipped tan-colored head (good lacing).  Wow, the aroma is very inviting and includes lots of richly caramelized malt, dreamy dark chocolate, molasses fruitiness, and a tinge of tobacco/cigar.  The flavor is somewhat dry with some lightly citrusy bitterness in the finish.  Roasted malts, plain coffee, cocoa power, some sort of fruitiness (more molasses like, I guess), distant nutty quality, hints of ash (toward the backside when colder) comprise the overall flavor characteristics.  Some alcohol shows around the edges toward the finish, but it works really well with the overall flavor.  The body of htis beer medium to medium-full beer and it is really smooth on palate.  Overall this is a pretty complex, unique, and very pleasing brown ale.

1993,"2008-07-29",3.3,"355ml bottle from a trade with a non-RBer.  I mean in what way is this a brown ale?  Yes, it’s a nice beer, but really an Indian Brown Ale, what is that?  It’s a malty choccy beer, a strong (stout) porter perhaps, but a brown ale?  Growing up in the pubs of 1950s East Cheam, brown ale never tasted like this, or am I confusing myself with Tony Hancock again?  Innit marvellous! Or perhaps there’s a joke here that I’m not getting?  It’s got some American hop on aroma and then a rich lush dry malt mouthfeel and flavour and yet remains with some juiciness.  Crunchy milk choc malt.  As much as I like the US beer scene, sometimes I’m left in complete disbelief.  Anyway, forgetting the IBA problem, is the beer any good?  Reminds me a bit of Wychwood Hobgoblin with a bit more hop and alcohol, an Imperial Hobgoblin perhaps.  Bit too syrupy on the malts maybe.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

Roasty malt with some smoke and caramel and piney hop notes. I am expecting a hoppy scotch style porter. Much like many DFH beers this is a bit unbalanced. To much hops and not enough malt, however they are going for a bit of a scotch IPA so maybe they hit the mark. Regardless the bitter coffee finish is a bit unpleasant a bit to aggressive. The middle has a nice malt background and the alcohol notes are just right. There is some chocolate and caramel present but this is not sweet enough to be a scotch anything.

1993,"2008-05-22",3.2,"Out of the bottle.  The description enticed me to try.  I was entrigued by a great blend of well-hopped beer with a strong Scotish Brown Ale, but found that it fell slightly short of the former.  While I enjoyed the beer, my initial reaction remained. 
The aroma was dominated mostly by the dark malts and I found little hop presence, despite its description.  There is little evidence of a well-hopped beer, not only in aroma, but also throughout. 
It looked quite quite nice, both in clarity as well and creamy, rich foam retention.
The flavor is thick with darker caramel and chocolate. Sweetness permeates the brew, but is somewhat balanced out by the tart coffee flavorings, somewhat.  
An above average mouth feel, not too watery, not too thick.  

Not bad at all, but I think the billing for this beer is a little off, as the IBUs(if indeed around 50) dont tend to translate as far as aroma, flavor, or even bitterness.","USA","Breworthy"

I taste more malt than hops in this one, probably due to the mild(ish) flavor the Goldings.  Palate is medium and creamy but finishes a bit dry for me.

1993,"2008-03-13",4.1,"Pours a deep brown with a small tan head that faded fast. Smells of malt, raisins, chocolate and a touch of coffee.

1993,"2008-03-12",4.1,"Purchased at Trader Joes in bottles.

Rich appearing dark brown color with malty aroma.  Tan head disappeared quickly.  Nice full mouthfeel and very malty satisfying flavor with caramel malt presence quite pronounced.  Sweetness well-balanced by significant hop bitterness which is accompanied by fine English-type hop flavor.  Darn near a porter, I would agree with Dogfishs description of a cross between a Scotch Ale and IPA, though cant see any American Pale resemblance.

1993,"2008-03-12",4.0,"12oz brown bottle - bottled on 05/01/07
Pours a very dark brown with a hint of crimson. Thin head that remains through entire beer.  Sweet and malty with a faint hint of alcohol on the nose.

1993,"2008-03-06",3.5,"12 oz bottle.  Poured a dark brown/black with a 1 finger tan head that lingered around with significant lacing.  Aroma was of carmely marts with an oh so slight touch of bitter hops.  Taste was mostly of dark carmely malt with a bit of a bitter kick, from the hops Im guessing.  Had a very smooth chocolate/coffee aftertaste...nice!  Light carbonation and a thick body made for an overall pleasant mouthfeel.  I think the description of a cross between a Scotch Ale and an IPA is pretty accurate.  However the hops dont really come through due to the malts.  All in all Id say it almost tastes like a slightly more bitter (hopped) Porter.  Good beer though, but not my favorite DFH product.","USA","bpowers"

1993,"2008-02-26",3.8,"Bottle. Aroma of coffee, roast/smoke (maybe im crazy for getting smoke), as it warms some candi sugar. Flavor at first very much coffee, thought it was going to be one-dimensional at first, but those candi sugars keep popping through, the hops show their face, it actually becomes a really interesting and very unique brew, and Im a sucker for uniqueness. For me the best way to describe this beer is to say that normally I dont like going back to back in the same style, I like to mix things up. But after this beer, I couldnt think of what to go to next. It just had so much of so many different styles in it, Belgian notes, porter notes, APA notes (a different list than they give, but thats how I felt), that it seemed to just stand alone.

Pours a nice dark amber, almost dark brown with a one finger head that dissolved into a pleasant lace that went down along with the beer nicely.

Smelled great right from the pour of what I would expect from this style-malty, a bit sugary, and some chocolate/coffee hints. 

The taste follows right through from the smell and it was well balanced with malt, chocolate, sugar, coffee, and hops (of course!) flavors all of the way through. 

Not too heavy, but definitely a full beer. I was a little weary of the 7.2% ABV, but I didnt really detect too much alcohol-that can be a bit dangerous as it went down pretty smooth. I could drink these things all day if I wasnt sure that they I would have a problem standing later!

1993,"2008-01-04",3.5,"From a bottle.  Pours a dark brown with small off white head.  Brown sugar, syrup, and some coffee in the nose.  Taste is more of the brown sugar along with some hops.  Nice medium body.  good brew.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","ReademNwheat"
1993,"2008-01-02",3.6,"Draft at Ashleys in Ann Arbor.  Pours a dark brown.  It is fairly bitter and hoppy and has a slight finish.  It has just a bit of sweetness.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","dsm"
1993,"2008-01-02",4.1,"Very sweet smelling aromas, coupled with a dark color that just begs to be sipped.  The barley is immediately recognizable, and the sugars make you think youre just having a bowl of fermented Golden Puffs cereal without the milk.  Incredibly flavorful.","Virginia, USA","vmilaxer29"
1993,"2008-01-01",3.6,"Im not a big brown ale fan but this is the best Ive come across so far.  Definite notes of brown sugar and roasted malt in both the smell and taste here.  Most of the browns that Ive tried are a little watery but not this one.  Quite full of flavor.  I really like this.","Huron, Tennessee, USA","Tilley4"
1993,"2008-01-01",3.5,"12 ounce bottle.  Pours clear dark bown with  short lived tan head.  Lots of rising bubbles.  Notes of dark honey, molasses, raisins, and chocolate in the nose.  Quite malty.  Roasty.  Coffe with sweetner.  Very bitter as well.  Medium body. High carbonation.  Dry finish.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
1993,"2007-12-30",4.1,"Thanks to my homey J Carney for smuggling this back from NJ. Pours a medium brown, not too light, not too dark. Has a thin yellowish head. Smells sweet of brown sugar and nuts. There is a touch of the hops as well and of course the barley as well. Tastes sweet up front with quite a bit of bitterness in the background. The hops arent bitter like an IPA because I think the bitterness must be balanced out by the sweet brown sugar and nutty flavors. Pretty thick for a beer thats only 7.2%, not that 7.2% isnt much. Pretty good carbonation. Drinks like a way bigger beer because of all the flavor. This brew is so tasty it could get me in trouble. I just want to keep drinkin it to get to the bottom of all the flavor.","San Diego, California, USA","doubleo"
1993,"2007-12-30",3.9,"Has a pleasant sweetness that isnt over-powering.  I definitely agree with the commercial description when it comes to the notes of molasses and coffee.  Another exceptional beer from DFH.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","TheSponge"
1993,"2007-12-29",3.5,"a slight coffee aroma with a dark brown tint.  I can taste the caramelized brown sugar.  It starts smooth on the palate and then heads toward the bitterness of the hops.  I like this beer.","Savannah, Georgia, USA","Scowick"
1993,"2007-12-29",3.6,"Served to me a very dark brown, resembling a stout with a thin layer of head that remained and laced throughout. Smells of sweet malt, toasted nuts and a breath of fresh hops. Starts off tasting of some toasted malt, some coffee and a beautiful hop finish. Mouthfeel is nice and full, some carbonation and a tasty bite from the hops that lingers on the toungue. For a stout this is good, for a brown ale this is fantastic. Very smooth and filling, if it were winter right now this would be a pint of $3 liquid crack. A must try on tap (my only experience)","Columbus, Maryland, USA","franksnbeans"
1993,"2007-12-29",3.6,"From bottle, pours very dark brown and nearly opaque with slim tan head. Aroma is of chocolate and brown sugar. Rich mouthfeel. Taste is of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and brown sugar. It pulls back with a hint of nuttiness, but I dont detect much of the Indian here (i.e.,  hop bitterness). As a result, its veers close to being too sweet. Still, I like it a lot. Cant sense the ABV, but the richness (and price) would keep me from drinking too many.","Rochester, New York, USA","McGarnigle"
1993,"2007-12-27",3.6,"Pours a dark reddish brown with a thin tan head.  Aroma is sweet with notes of brown sugar, ginger, and malt.  Bright on the palate with brown sugar, chocolate, and coffee up front.  Bitter and hoppy at the end with ginger evident.  Another fine brew from Dogfish Head.","Joliet, Illinois, USA","hogan873"
1993,"2007-12-27",3.6,"bottled.  Very dark brown colour with red/amber highlights.  Small tan head that settles quickly into a film.   Aroma is molasses, figs and candied fruits.  Full flavour and nice body make this an exciting brown.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"

1993,"2007-12-24",4.2,"A: Pours a beautiful brown color with a thick off-white head. The head fell fairly quickly leaving only a thin layer of foam.

S: This beer has a hearty malt aroma with a good chocolate blast. I dont get any hop aroma off of this.

T: This is a very full flavored beer and I like it a lot...definitely more than last time I had it. It has malt, caramel, and a bit of chocolate in it and finishes with some bitterness, but not overwhelmingly so. Its been a while since I had this and I think my IBU tolerance has gone up by a factor of 10 since then, and now this barely even registers.

M: This is one hell of a creamy beer. It is decently heavy bodied for a brown, but not Double Stout thick.

D: I am usually impressed with DFH and this is no exception. Another great example of a style breaker.","Troy, New York, USA","drseamus"

1993,"2007-12-12",3.8,"dark brown with a small off white head.  Plenty of caramal and chocolate in the nose,  a bit of hops.  The taste is a nice blend of hops and malts.  Maybe some coffee added in along to it.  Finishes very smooth,  little carbonation.  Evenly matched bitter to sweet,  but neither are overpowering.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"
1993,"2007-12-11",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2007 Pours a dark amber brown with yellow/brown head. Full-bodied aroma of chocolate, malts, &coffe. Tastes of creamy chocolate malts with a little touch of zippy hops. Palate, is thick, smooth and pleasant. Low carbonation and respectable alc/vol. Not sure how anyone could rate this as any IPA, much closer to dark amber ale, but a special brew nonetheless","Florida, USA","shackinetics"
1993,"2007-12-11",4.5,"As a huge fan of IPAs, I had no trouble trying this one a few times.  Its hard to find a more aromatic, hoppy, perfectly colored IPA than this one.

1993,"2007-12-09",3.5,"I dont know if its truly a combination of a scotch ale and an IPA, but it works pretty well. Gorgeous reddish brown color, modest head, and that nice nutty molasses aroma typical of a scotch ale. Caramel and molasses flavor with a fairly bitter finish which doesnt last very long. Id like it a little more if mouthfeel were a little thicker and chewier. Very dry for a scotch ale.","somerville, Massachusetts, USA","Hugerat"
1993,"2007-12-08",4.2,"Had this on tap at the Dog and Pony Ale House in Renton, WA.  Pours very dark, not quite black, with a tan head.  Strong aroma of toffee, and coffee. Flavor was rich in malt, with brown sugar and caramel notes. Hops balanced it out nicely. Smooth, moderately heavy on the palate, keeps the roof of the mouth involved, even after the finish.  Very nice beer. Ill probably be getting a case as soon as I can get my hands on one.","Renton, Washington, USA","Tenderstone"
1993,"2007-12-06",3.7,"Smells like a fresh cup of coffee.  Tastes like coffee with caramel and figs.  A little heavy for me, but a great means of redefining brown ale.","USA","switzer"

1993,"2007-11-27",3.4,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2008 Excellent beer! Very intense, full-bodied chocolate brown flavor. Dark brown color with full brown-tinged head. Not exactly a session brown like Newcastle, but certainly one of the finest beers I have ever tasted.

1993,"2007-11-19",3.9,"This is always one of my favorites, unlike most other browns out there.  Much more hoppy and dry tasting, which is great if you want to do a brown but dont need the sweetness.

1993,"2007-11-11",4.0,"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark amber color with a whitish head.  Strong chocolate aroma, coffee.  Tastes chocolatey and sweet.  I have to admit that when I first tasted this I truly thought I was drinking a stout (someone handed it to me in a glass and said ""Drink this"" and I drank obediently.) The only thing that would normally give it away as not being a stout is the lighter color.  Either way, its pretty damn good.  One of my favorite Dogfish Heads.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DeweyDell"
1993,"2007-11-09",2.7,"A darn brown almost black ale. Pours with little head. Little carbonation. The aroma is a little musty. The flavor is ok, and the carmelized onions really come through in the taste. Has a mellow aftertaste.","austin, Texas, USA","kidmartinek"

1993,"2007-11-08",4.1,"Coffee and Chocolate aroma.  Thick creamy chocolatey head.  Very dark brown color.  Thick with an initial bite, smooths out and provides a satisfying finish.  This is a well crafted beer.  Would definately recommend.","Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, USA","checkmatei1"
1993,"2007-11-08",4.0,"Wow this was gooooood.  True to form, it poured a deep dark brown with a respectable tan head.  Aroma of hot chocolate and molasses.  Taste is full.  Very full.  Strong notes of chocolate, dark malts and caramel.  Alcohol very well hidden.  Almost more Porter like than a traditional brown ale.  Somewhat bitter and hoppy.  Perfect on almost any day with almost any food or cigar.  Wont be my last of these.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","Canadianlush"
1993,"2007-11-07",3.6,"17-Jun-07 (12 oz bottle: Purchased 07-Jun-07 for $1.90 at Liquid Solutions in Tigard, OR) Assertive aromas of roasted malts, molasses, dark fruits, dark chocolate and coffee jump out of the glass and aggressively convey that this is no ordinary brown ale, though the beers name of Indian Brown Ale is also a strong hint.  On the palate, this is intensely flavored for a brown ale, with plenty of medium-dark roast, chocolate, brown sugar, sweet black fruits, and blackstrap molasses balanced by a good dose of moderately bitter, classic hop flavor, plus yeast notes and light tartness in the background for added complexity.  Other than the increased roasty bitterness in the long-lasting finish, this beer is fairly linear.  Medium-full bodied on the palate with medium carbonation.  Dark brown in color and fairly clear with ruby highlights toward the edge, this beer is capped by a small, light-tan head that dissolves to a wide ring and fails to leave behind anything more than a few spots of lace on the glass.  Dogfish Head has shown that brown ales can indeed be packed with full-throttle flavor, and complex enough for contemplative sipping.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
1993,"2007-11-06",3.6,"A dark chocolate brown with a nice tan foamy head that slowly settles. The apperance reminded me a lot of a really good root beer. The aroma was very subtle to me. Nice fragrance, but nothing that really stood out. The taste was initially a nice hoppy bite and rolling flavors of roasted nuts, coffee and leaves a flavor of an aged wood charded barrel on the palate for a long lingering finish.  You cant go wrong with this one!","Florida, USA","gpekar"
1993,"2007-11-04",3.8,"Had this in Atlanta on tap at Brick Store Pub.  I was super happy with this hybrid, as I have been with other Dogfish Head brews.  Hoppy and malty mellow at the same time.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","mistersinalin"
1993,"2007-11-01",3.3,"Pours a nice chocolate brown with thin off-white head that lingers wewll and leaves okay lacing. Aroma is a sweet mix of caramel, toffee and roasted nuts, but the mouthfeel of this fairly thin bodied beer is somewhat watery. Flavor is a continuation of the sweet caramel and nuts, with a finish that is warming, but somewhat on the sweet and watery side for my liking.

Not a bad beer, but DFH makes better.","Dacula, Georgia, USA","kimcgolf"

1993,"2007-10-24",4.0,"Poured an attractive brown color with slight off-white head that begs to be drank. Aroma is of caramel and chocolate with a maltiness to it.

Good drinkability.","Hattiesburg, Mississippi, USA","biggmike"

Pours dark dark brown body, aroma is light chocolate, caramel, and roastiness.  Taste is same...smooth too. Tasted more like a porter. Great beer. RERATE :: Draft at RnH with Linh. Pours a deep brown body with very slight lacing. Aroma is nutty, sweet malts, and a tad of alcohol. Mouthfeel is okay - similar notes in the flavor as in the aroma.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
1993,"2007-10-20",4.1,"bottle.  wonderful.  pours a very dark brown with a nice tan head that lasts throughout.  chocolate, coffee and malts are the most prevalent.  medium body, low carbonation, sweet and full of flavor.  much better than your typical brown ale.  Dogfish delivers with this one... will definitely buy again... a pleasure to drink.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","craftbeerdesign"
1993,"2007-10-20",3.5,"Bottle.  Its taken me surprisingly long to get around to rating this.  Chocolate and peat nose, dark slushy malt and hidden fruit, with roast coffee notes and a touch of alcohol.  Deep ruby pour nears pitch, with a soapy, creeping tanned head.  Taste alternatingly sweet and dry, edges closer to the latter, and thankfully avoids DFHs typical sugar.  Gritty dry notes ala a Scotch Ale, but the peat and swashy malt is missing.  Yeast and light nuttiness toward the finish.  Figs and raisins but without the sweetness of either.  Toasty malt with caramel and light hoppiness.  Chocolate and berry.  Medium body and lightly warming after a few ounces - of the really pleasant kind, in the chest and stomach only.  Touch of hoppy cottonmouth around the teeth, but its not so bad.  Goldings shining nicely in the aftertaste.  Pretty exceptional for a brown, though I agree with some below that its closer to a Doppelbock.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
1993,"2007-10-19",3.7,"Dark brown with a decent head.  Nice caramel and malt aroma with a balanced flavor of hops and malts.  Good take to blend two styles.  Slight brown sugar taste as well.","Dallas, Texas, USA","travita"
1993,"2007-10-19",3.5,"Pours very dark with a fizzy beige head.  Aromas of nuts, molasses and a spicy hop bouquet.  Rich, porter-like flavors; a bit of molasses sweetness more than balanced by a hoppy finish.  A bit of a lingering aftertaste.","Texas, USA","Mutualaid"
1993,"2007-10-19",4.1,"Bottle. Really dark brown, almost black, thick tan head. Caramel and roasted coffee aroma. Theres a ton of nuts, coffee, and even powerful hops melding in this brown ale. It truly is a blend of styles making this a heavily infused brown ale. Im not normally a brown fan, but this is the best one Ive ever had.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","DukeBrewDevil"
1993,"2007-10-19",4.1,"12oz bottle. Fantastic near black pour with malty roasted nose.  First sip, sooo much going on at once...  Grassy hops, roasted Malts, and some Alc tang  having an orgy in my mouth.  Smooth finish.  Medium bodied, well carbonated, it wants to be drank.","Manhattan, New York, USA","Pwn3d"
1993,"2007-10-16",3.5,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a clear very dark brown body under a fleeting fizzy light brown head that completely vanished immediately.  Aroma is a nice blend of nutty, slightly husky malt and a hefty amount of hoppiness.  A little coffee and cola notes also.  A very unusual Brown Ale, lots of nuttiness and coffee but the hops of an IPA.  Its missing some of the depth that that might be there because of the filtration though.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly oily texture and moderate fizzy carbonation.  Pretty nice for a Brown Ale, and quite distinctive.  I can only imagine what a nice bottle conditioned version would be.  Its been a long time since Ive had one of these and it was nice to revisit it.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
1993,"2007-10-15",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2008 barley brew feels and almost tastes like chocolate. there is a slight more toasted flavor here. the brew is quite velvety with its light brown cap. coffee flavor not really present in my bottles. looks all deep brown and lucsious. cant easily discern the hop character but, i could easily tell if it was unbalanced sooo... this is a good brew. what else do you expect from dogfish head!

1993,"2007-10-14",3.5,"Dark dark ruby-brown with some bubbles and a medium sized light tan head.  Aroma of toffee.  First flavor is of strong bitter hops quickly washed away by very sweet malt.  Has some coffee and raisin.  Burnt malt aftertaste.  Sticky palate, fizzy carbonation.    I dont know what to make of this... I see the scotch ale and IPA sides... but as a brown ale this is intense.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"
1993,"2007-10-13",3.4,"Poured a reddish brown with fizzy light tan head.  Roasted malt, chocolate, hops, a little bit of fruit, and molasses.  Medium mouthfeel.  Pretty decent brown ale, but nothing special.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"

Frothy carbonation. Starts with coffee, a little caramel, then more coffee. As the coffee leaves, there is more caramel. There is a nice bitter, but not too dry, finish. Very tasty. Not your mothers brown ale. 50 IBU? Could be, but all that coffee provides enough bitter, so its not necessarily 50 IBU from hop. Just wonder where the chocolate that generated the aroma went.

Some caramelized flavor, but not enough. Notes of molasses, raisins, and chocolate get overwhelmed by French-roast coffee. The texture is too thin to support the roastiness--a beer like this needs to be thick and creamy like a stout. Indeed, the predominant flavors are stout-like. This beer lacks finesse.

As I begin to smell the beer, I notice a bit of a dark nuttiness, but the thing that struck me the most was what appeared to be a hint of something almost like lemon in the background. The taste is a bit of dry, bitter coffee. Just a bit on the nutty side, with a hint of hops biting at the tongue. The taste is a bit a nice bitter sweet, not overpowering. This is pretty easy drinking, but a bit high on the carbonation.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","cewldre"

More of a Scottish rather than a Scotch ale.  It isnt sweet enough to be a Scotch, and lacks the fruit, sweet malt, and vinous qualities common to those beers.  But there is abundant malt.  The malt is a little bitter, but balanced by prominent brown sugar and just a little raisin.  The coffee and ginger are not perceptible.  Very dark brown, good palate.  A little bit nutty in the finish.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1993,"2007-06-07",4.2,"There I was, last weekend, talking about beer, and bemoaning the fact that I cant find a decent brown ale back home in Atlanta. 

And BAM, what shows up in the cooler at Once Upon a Vine during my roadtrip to Richmond, but Dogfish Heads Indian Brown Ale!

Appearance: Poured out a crystal clear dark-reddish brown color with a khaki-colored head recedes to a thin band around the glass.

Smell: Chockablock scent full of sweet satisfaction - hazlenut coffee, brown sugar, and candied dark fruits. 

Taste: The flavor of this brown ale is so far superior that it barely warrants mentioning, but Ill do my best. A rich, assertive malt base charges the tongue. Fiendishly sweet flavor suggesting coffee, toasted nuts, and cooked caramel (which carries with it a delicate smokiness). A restrained herbal hop bitterness allows the malts to really shine through. Finishes with a lasting roastiness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Light on the carbonation, keeping this brew singularly smooth and creamy.

Drinkability: Yeah, to sum up: Dogfish Heads Indian Brown Ale is strikingly drinkable and incredibly tasty! For me, that was enough, but the beer is unique and clever and well done enough that any fans of the style should check it out.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
1993,"2007-06-05",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 7, 2009 Bottle. Toasted malt aromas jump out the moment you pour this beer. Heavy smells of dark bread, nuts and a bit of coffee. A very light citrus and leather smell with a little smoke in the background. Head is rocky, off white with fair lacing and its mostly diminishing. Color is dark brown. Flavor starts off moderately sweet and the long finish is moderately bitter and a touch acidic. Palate is medium, oily with lively carbonation and both lightly astringent and alcoholic in the finish. Another great Dogfish Head creation.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

The aroma is that of coffee, roasted malt, a fair bit of alcohol, and more hops than I expected.  The taste follows suit, but also folds in a bit of sweet chocolate and even some hazelnut.  The hops give a nice finish to balance out the sweetness....something I think alot of brown ales lack.  The melding of excellent flavors and aromas, and most importantly the unique sharp finish, make this an excellent brown in my book.  Strong recommendation.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1993,"2007-06-01",3.8,"The pour begets a beauty of an ale that is mahogany colored, with a halo of ruby, and a thin tan head.  The smell of freshly baked pumpernickel bread and molasses wafts up from the glass.  Upon drinking, the mouthfeel is adequately heavy, with a softness and silkiness that is unexpected.

Many flavors are present, some moreso than others.  The most prominent are that of a dark bread, rye or pumpernickel, that is lightly toasted (the toastedness lends itself to an even lighter roastedness); molasses; brown sugar; a hint of raisin; and a minor alcohol edge.

The head leaves some lace and subsides into a thin ring around beer where it touches the glass with some slight tan clouds over the surface. The aroma is very nice and sweet: lots of malts, toffee, and brown sugar with some notes of roasted grain and a little alcohol. The flavor starts very roasty and porter-like. The middle of the tongue finds lots of sweet malts, toasted bread, molasses, and caramel. Towards the back of the tongue the flavor of alcohol is apparent. The beer finishes medium in body with a very bitter end. The after-taste is bitter from both hops and from dark grains. The mouthfeel is light and dry and tickles the tongue with a decent amount of carbonation.

The carbonation is very present and adds a pungency that drives the entire taste home. Forms a thin, light brown head - the first Ive ever seen from a dark ale.

1993,"2007-04-08",3.8,"This beer was great. The reason why is because this is an ale, and I am closely relating this beers taste to an imperial stout. A nice burnt caramel, chocolate smell. The beer is DARK brown, and almost black. Very nice taste, with a burnt wood taste. Very nice palate, nice and smooth but again too thin for me.

Yes, insanely hopped beers get alot of attention, but a good brown ale is something to be appreciated as well. They mention caramelized brown sugar on the bottle, and it is apparent in this beer. Seems to have a bit of spiciness in it as well - possibly ginger. Last come the hops to keep the sweetness under control.

Aroma is actually sort of faint off the top, but increased as the glass warmed. Fairly malty/nutty in the nose, with a faint hoppiness in the distance. A bit like an English ale. Flavour however, changes all of that, and this beers awesomeness starts to show itself. Let me take you through it: hops and English malt character off the top, which then transitions to notes of coffee, chocolate, caramelized sugar. This then settles into a roasty, chocolatey finish with a lingering finish not totally unlike an Imperial Stout. You know, or something like that. Im no expert. But I know this is very good.  Its like an English ale, an Imperial stout, a brown ale, an IPA. The finish on this might be the best part...its incredibly long, roasty, hoppy, and awesome.

1993,"2007-03-01",4.5,"THOUGHTS: This beer was my New Years ""Revolution."" I was initially confused by the name, but the flavor want confusing at all  it was great. I wasnt expecting much, but it brings together the best of each of the styles it combines. One of the biggest surprises of my beer drinking life. This beer deserves a category all its own, or at least to be put into some sort of hybrid category. There was caramel, coffee sweetness followed up by a nice and not overpowering hop bitterness. Great aroma. DfH gets so much cred for their extreem beers, but this beer is proff that just about anything they try is a quality beer. After each sip I just wanted another. I imagine that this is what beer would have tasted like in Scotland if hops were more readily availble in the past. I even gave this a few bonus points in the Overall category bor creativity and the ability to execute it this well.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown with a small, almost soapy-looking, off-white head that mostly diminished. The aroma was moderate caramel and mild coffee, light to moderate citrus (grapefruit) hops and just a little alcohol as it warmed. The initial flavor was moderately to heavily sweet and lightly bitter, while the finish was moderately to heavily sweet and bitter with an average duration. Incredibly well balanced. The body was medium to full and a little dry up front, but that might have just been the carbonation, and syrupy with fizzy carbonation and a metallic but not overpowering finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

1993,"2007-02-26",3.3,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2007 11.05.2007 Re-Rate: 12 oz bottle.  pours mahogany, yet with a slight shimmer. the head is solid, slow to recede, and lacing is on the thicker side for a brown ale.  aromas hint at plums, ripe apricots, raisins, and light chocolate.  its not quite as sweet as ive tasted before.  taste hits like a roasted nutty explosion. a bit of roasted coffee bean touches the top of the palate.  theres not much on the back palate, but the front hits with a malbec-type dryness.  still, tastes of slight hazelnut linger on the velvety finish.  i just wish it would coat more of the palate, and last a bit longer.  it almost just quits it the middle.  good beer, dfh still rocks.

------  12oz bottle.  pours brown or deep ruby, depending on the lighting.  about avg head, more foam than bubbles.  this is one brew where the description actually fits the beer to a ""t"".  the finish is very smooth and well-rounded, like a nice pinot noir.  though one aspect DFH left out was its high propensity to have many of them at once.  the drinkability is very high here.  DFH has found a way to not produce bad beer.  kudos to them.

1993,"2007-01-18",1.8,"Dogfish head, a well respected brand on this site. This beer has some stiff competition; Troegs, wild Goose and Bells all make some decent brown ales. On tap at the Bocktown bar & grill in the Robinson twp shopping complex. Pours dark reddish brown in my glass with a light tan head.  No outstanding aroma but it does have a hint of stoutness to it. The initial flavor reminds me of a stout or porter, roasty/hoppy bitterness in the onslaught.  Many porters Ive had are not this bitter. Pretty complex, too much like a lighter imperial stout.  If you can get over the bitterness, this has a decent flavor. If you are a lover of imp stouts or IPA, you better check this out.  IMO this has too much bitterness for a brown ale style, which I believe should be more mild, enjoyable and repeatable.  The finish is lasting bitterness that holds true for awhile once done drinking.

The beer produced a longish finish which was slightly drying. I enjoyed this beer mostly for its flavor contrast. It cant hide its Scotch Ale roots.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","blueduk"

1993,"2006-12-07",3.4,"I didnt examine the bottle closely, but from its name I figured this beer would be a very hoppy brown ale, and I was a bit mistaken in this expectation.

The beer poured a dark color with an abundant fluffy tan head.  It definitely resembled a porter more to me than a brown ale, but was still a handsome thing to behold.

Odor was of caramel with some coffee notes, with just a whiff more hops than I would expect from a stout or porter.

Flavor mirrored aroma, as the product tasted very good with abundant caramel malt character and coffee taste notes, with some hops evident at the finish.

Mouthfeel was pleasant.  Drinkability was not hugely high...I had a several beers prior to this one, and after this one my evening was over.

This product was very good, however given my previous experience with Dogfish Head beers, I expected something different, bolder, or more unusual.  I thought this beer would be super-hoppy, and it wasnt.  A fine beer, but not what I expected.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

I think Im losing it. Ive been quite consistant in being underwhelmed by the just about everything Ive tried from DFH (with the possible exception of Raison dEtre) Heres today, coming into this beer with a minimum of expectations, I poured the glass (dark dark brown with a scant head), and the aroma was intriguing - warm smoky malts, brown sugar, hints of metallic hops. The taste - the taste was marvellous. Definately malt and smoke like a good scotch ale, but well hopped, any plenty of sweet nutty rich brown sugar,  a DFH experiment that I actually like. Somehow they avoid the ""too roasted plus too hoppy"" trap that befalls so many West Coast seasonals, and instead come up with a dark IPA + more that really works.

It poured an interesting brown color with a quickly receding head. The aroma was strongly malt. However, once in the mouth it was thin with little complexity and certainly not enough backbone...all of the structure was from malts, and it appeared that there were a variety, but the result was a watery, fairly sweet offering.

1993,"2006-08-03",4.0,"Appearance: Pours a deep smooth brown color, thick and sticky looking with very little head but lots of lacing.

Smell: Sharply sweet caramels, brown sugar and nuts. Very toasted malt and sugary aroma.

Taste: It is not quite as sweet as the aroma would suggest. Nice and malty and pleasantly caramel sweet, but not cloyingly sweet. The alcohol shows through slightly and serves as a balancing agent, along with a bit of spiciness; and then there is also a hop presence in the finish and the aftertaste. 

Mouthfeel: Very nice and smooth. It is not quite sticky but it is thick and almost chewy. I like that aspect of sweet brown ales.

Drinkability: As a fan of the style I was expecting to be pleased. DFH rarely lets me down and this is no exception. It is a very decent sweet Brown Ale that I found quite easy to drink. I would not however consider it sessionable as it would end up being too sweet after a few.

The look: Clear dark-ruby/mahogany body topped by a medium beige head
In long: Fruity and hoppy nose, unusual for a brown ale.  Taste has some of the nutty brown ale elements with chestnuts and roasted almonds but is also very fruity and creamy.  Feels like drinking an alcoholised fruity cake dessert.  Interesting mixture of brownies and grapes, earthy notes, some plums, and more.  The hopping is really what makes that beer.  Citrusy and lemony hops create a sharp contrast with the brown ale elements of the beer.  I will always remember when I had it at the Vermont Brewers Fest 2006 when they served it processed through an invention that dwarfs any of Thomas Edison creations. Behold the Hop-Inducer thingy!

1993,"2006-07-05",3.3,"Pours a rich deep mahogany red with a thin light tan head, it looks rather promising.  The aroma quite as regal.  Not unpleasant, the aroma is dominated by alcohol, caramel, and sweet malts with subtle english hops.  The mouthfeel is luxurious and creamy without being so heavy as to hold this back from being relatively sesionable.  Above all else, the flavors are unbalanced.  Sweet and malty, with rather forward alcohol, the hops are so mild mannered that one could miss them all together if ones focus was slightly amiss, or even if engaged in lively conversation.  The alcohol returns at the back end of the beer, giving this the feel of a ruby port or sherry rather than any of the beer styles this is intended to bear semblance to.  A lingering bitterness in line with those gentle hops is one of the few redeaming qualities of this brew.  A rounder or subtler malt bill with less sweetness or more robust hops could easily bring balance to this beer, but in the mean time this beer is a bit wobbly.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

1993,"2006-05-22",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2007 I wonder, as my breadth and depth of experience in beer drinking continues to flourish, which direction my tastes will move.  On one extreme is the minimalist Japanese Zen approach where architecture to food should be presented simply, but beautifully.  If it were a beer, it should have a clean, minimal palate of flavors.  But, those flavors should be of the highest and finest quality.  Opposite is what I term, and Im sure what scholars would shun, the complex and dramatic Baroque.  Painters like Nicolas Poussin or the sculptor Gian Bernini found beauty in the dramatic, the passionate and the peak of the moment.  In a beer Baroque would be tantamount to unsettlingly deep and complex symphonies of flavors, coupled with indescribable colors and admirably bountiful aromas.  At the moment I eschew the former, firmly embracing the school of thought that instructs the deeper the beer, the finer the beer.  And on most occasions I agree, but some brews are too crowded, too collided and too well crafted.  Perched on some breezy Belgian hill there is a man or a woman who sits on their sunlit porch over looking the hazy valleys and fields and identifies a beers components, flavors, and even brewer.  But Im just an avid consumer.  There is a possibility that the simple and simply good beer will come to represent my beer preferences.  The Dogfish head Indian Brown Ale is the one that started all this ruminating on lifes complexity, and for good reason.  It really is a simple beer, as brown ales usually are whether or not they have Indian preceding their title.  This brown ale in particular had a deep, shaded and rust color body that adumbrated the taste to come.  The head sat smugly on top of the beer, neither growing nor fading, but content to sit atop its magisterial throne of beer without care.  From this floating disc of bubbled brew came a delicious blend of flavors whose members included hazelnut, caramel, dark chocolate, soy sauce and the unmistakable weighty textured aroma of heavy cream.  And within the beer itself was a light though thorough maltiness which had me doubting the labels veracity.  It was a self-satisfying taste, with a calmness altogether like a brown ale, but with more flavor like a port.  Whether my beerological cupidity goes one way or another, to the Spartan brew or to the ornately flavored Baroque I cannot say, but this Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale has at least opened possibilities for the Zen side of beer.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Mossy and spicy.  Nutty and cherry flavors as well.  Hop bitterness comes in the back.  Not hugely powerful, but a good bit of it.  A bit overcarbonated, along with a grainy texture takes big points off for the palate.

The body is medium to light with a very lively palate and a little watery.  Maybe a little too much carbonation which may have contributed to the slight wateriness.

1993,"2006-01-28",4.3,"This is a very interesting beer, in the fact that stylistically is a cross between a Scottish ale, and an IPA. This beer has great malt character, and sweetness, from the use of caramelized brown sugar, that is balanced to some degree, with vibrant hop character. At 7.2% abv, it is a great sipping brew, and one I enjoyed while watching the ball game at the bar. Available in 6 packs that retail for $7, this is a year round brew, and one that doesnt get the attention other DFH beers gets, but one that I think should get more. 

Indian Brown Ale pours to a beautiful, bright, deep chestnut color, with a thick and creamy tan head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is very inviting, with lots of good sweet, malty, and nutty aroma paired with some citrus/piney hop aroma. The palate is very firm, with lots of good sweet malty, nutty, and caramel flavors, that is full on the tongue. Indian Brown Ale finishes with more good sweet and nutty malt up front, then ends with just enough citrus/piney hop bitterness to take the cloying edge off this beer. 

I really enjoyed this one. You really get lots of sweet malt character in this beer, and the hop character while very apparent, is there to cut the sweet malt character of this beer. I wont say it balances, as this beer is more malty than hoppy, but make no mistake, you can smell and taste hops in this beer as well. I like the fact that you get lots of malt and lots of hops in this beer, and it is a great beer to sit and relax with.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Quite sticky on the palate, with lots of sweetness in there (chocolate, molasses, and caramel), semi-fresh coffee grind, and a roasted nuttiness.  Medium-bodied, and not a whole lotta carbonation in there.  It worked well with the flavors slowly creeping through the mouth.

Aroma is charming as usual, with brown sugar, whole wheat honey bread dough, Coca Cola, chocolatey roasted pecans and scores of silent black licorice.  Prevailing sweetness of caramel, chocolate and licorice register first in the flavor department.  A peppered trait curtails the nutty positioning of brazed pecans.  Potentially rye and beet sugar added for additional nuances.  Pecans are most relevant in the follow through.  Borderline syrupy, with hops providing the sprits in place of forced carbonation.

It wasnt as hoppy as Id have expected, but the hops were present.  It was also a little sour (not in a good way), a little malty sweet, and some caramel and brown sugar ... hmmm, just like the label says.

[Nov. 30, 2007]------- a tasty brew! Its full bodied with up front flavors of soy sauce, bakers chocolate, and pine. DFHs brown ale does not suffer from any of the flaws I may be weary of, given the style, but goes the extra mile by delivering a roasty, bitter, savory ale.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

(raisins), plums, moderate amounts of spicy, floral hops. Medium to full-bodied and moderately carbonated. Leaves you lips a little sticky. A very good brown that closely resembles a porter.

1993,"2005-08-28",4.1,"Very dark brown in the glass with nearly an inch of off-white head.  Some lacing.  Aromas are caramel, chocolate, woodsmoke and coffee, with a raisin/currant sweetness.  A tnagy, dry hop bite on the taste gives way to roast coffee, chocolate, and malt.  Dry finish.  This is a complex brew, it’s unique, and it surely deserves better than a 3.66 average rating.

1993,"2005-08-27",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2008 Sampler from bottle at Binnys, Orland Park.  Hmm. My first impression is that its more like a porter than anything else. But DFH themselves lists it as a cross of three different styles, and isnt that how porter got started?  Kind of lighter in malt body. As I might expect, it has a full load of hops, but theyre more support than for conquest. And some notes of figs and perhaps a touch of cinnamon. Delicious!","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
1993,"2005-08-27",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2005 Pours with a frothy four-finger thick, amber to light brown colored head.  The beer is a brilliantly clear, ruby highlighted deep amber-brown color.  The aroma is sweet and fruity up front with notes of caramel, cherries and a bit of sweet herbal hoppiness.  The nose finishes with a light roast note that evokes thoughts of toasted bread and milk chocolate.  The taste is sweet up front, and is followed quickly by very fruity notes that are reminiscent of cherries, perhaps even a bit like cough-syrup (though only lightly so).  The finish is long, though not heavy handed and has an astringent roast malt character to it.  This beer is quite smooth up front, but finishes with a prickle of carbonation that helps to balance the overall sweetness of the malt.  The body of this is fairly light, this beer is quite quaffable.  There are some hop notes here, though perhaps not as much as I was expecting from the label; there is a nice herbal quality in the middle, and the finish has a solid hop bite to it that helps to balance the sweet candied caramel note.

Thing head of tan foam that settles out fairly quickly. Very dry burnt toast and perked coffee aromas. No hop presence to speak of, and just the smalles hint of fruitiness. Very interesting flavor: I get a nice dry roastiness up front, followed by a toffee sweetness, and finishing with kind of a fortified Belgian character. A little bit buttery, and some alcohol warmth in the finish. Smooth and full on the palate.

The nutty aroma wafts up while I am pouring the beer out.  When I stick my nose in the glass, it is more of the same nutty aroma,  with some malty undertones, and possibly a touch of heavy roast. Taste is malty, somewhat roasty with coffee notes, but with some hops midway and even more hops on the finish, which eventually gives way to a malty, sweetish finish, no doubt helped by the caramelized brown sugar. Despite being sweetish on the finish, it is far from cloying. This seems to avoid the excessive maltiness sometimes present in these beers and makes it into a decent session beer.  I would have never guessed 7.2%, but that sugar addition has to contribute something more than sweetness...","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

I suppose its this year, because its fairly fresh, and still somewhat full of life. Poured out a deep cocoa brown color, with mahogany highlights. Medium tan colored head stayed to the bottom of the glass. Aromas are of Scharffen Berger Unsweetened Dark Chocolate, slight tobacco barn, alcohol, dark cherries macerated in rum, malts galore, some esters, and earthy hops. Tastes are terrific, especially for a brown ale. They include dark, rum soaked cherries, tobacco, dark baking chocolate, malts, slight fruitiness, and just enough bitterness from the hops to balance everything out nicely. Lingering tobacco tastes mix well with the lingering bitterness. Finishes too smooth for a brown ale of this gravity. Alcohol is well hidden in the tastes, but prevalent when you drink it. Warming and comforting all in one.
One hellacious brown ale. Highly recommended.","","Cobra"
1993,"2004-10-03",4.2,"A fine tan head stands atop a dark brown to near-black body. Sweet aroma with caramel notes. Strong sensation hits the tastebuds, an all-out hop assault. Warming with a definite alcohol kick, at 7.2%, probably the strongest brown ale Ive ever encountered. A totally unique animal; many browns are too lacking in hops,but this one ups the ante, making a tasty and powerful brew. Alcohol lessens some toward the end, for goodness sake. Definitely, one ofmy favorite brown ales.
Part of a growing trend in nomenclature. If its stronger than normal, call it Imperial Blank, if its hoppier, call it India Blank.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

I have to give them credit for making a very tasty beer in a style that I am not overly fond of. +++ Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a ruby-mahogany color with a large creamy tan head that lingered for quite some time. The aroma is both sweet and smoky. The palate is thick like most Dogfish Head brews (which happens to be an aspect that I am very fond of.) The flavor was sweet, nutty and smoky.

This beer has a unique taste, probably from the strange blend(?) described.  Has loads of roasted malt on the nose, caramel, vanilla, and bitter hops.  Opens up sweet with caramel and malt flavors, then quickly bitters with IPA type hops taste, then if you hold it in your mouth for longer goes back to being sweet with earthy, smokey, raisin, apple, beet, and slight nut flavors.  Somehow the hop bitterness seems to come and go, while the sweet flavors in this beer change in your mouth.  Wonderfull.

Small beige head, creamy and thick.  Aroma of light espresso/dark roast, chocolate, some hints of roastiness and some rootiness.  Flavor is even better.  Starts out with some light roastiness and some chocolate, gets smooth and sweet, with some spicy earthy/root type thing goin on.  The hops are definitely the most interesting thing.  They sorta waver in and out of the palate.  Not too bitter, just good and flavorful, clean and fresh they add more complexities but dont throw the balance off.  The caramelized brown sugar is definitely felt on the finish BUT mostly in the aftertaste, which is tremendously flavorful and lingering.  I have a lovely sticky sweetness lingering on my palate.  Not too sweet, as the coffee balances it and some hoppy residues remain.  Some drawbacks are a bit too much carbonation in the bottle, and perhaps a bit too heavy on the brown sugar.  Wow this stuff is awesome though.  Unique and great.  Its funny that I come to expect this from DFH.

A bit sugary and sweet along the lines of oatmeal with brown sugar.  This beer is eerily reminiscent of a doppelbock, but has the creamy texture of a strong ale.  Really a complex beer whe you think about it, yet simple in its concept.  One of the better brown ales I've tasted, but not a great beer.  Is there a great brown ale out there?  Anyway, this beer has a surprising, though mild, bitternes for a brown ale and a light astringency in the aftertaste/finish.  I like it.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

Cloying sugary flavor- this is much too sweet, and the sugars offset the nutty notes.  Over time, complexity improved and I noted nuttiness, toast, caramel, brown sugar (strong), chocolate, and a touch of cherry in the finish.  The body is too thin to carry the sugar-dominated palate.

Yet another beer that pours a dark mahogany body and a frothy kaki colored head! What’s with DFH beers and the roasted red pepper smell I detect every time I inhale? The aroma is of wet cardboard, oatmeal, coffee, a nodule of chocolate, and roasted chipolata peppers…… did I mention wet cardboard?  
  I don’t get it? This brewery makes some stuff I love, Amazing Masterpieces…. And then there is stuff like this that is just mediocre…… and then there is the Shelter Pale Ale that is donkey sack sweat!

1993,"2003-10-06",3.1,"I must admit it took me a while to tune my tastebuds for this ale. I've never been a fan of brown ales, and even though I see this is a well made brew, I find the carmelized brown sugar malt flavor a little harsh. This ale does have a nice bitter finish that saves it a little for me though.","Cleveland, USA","Ubiquibeer"

1993,"2003-09-30",4.2,"This chestnut brown beer pours with a medium tan head that displays excellent retention. As it slowly fades, it leaves behind a layer of film that hints at maltiness in the beer. It also leaves more of a sheeting than a lace on the glass sides. The aroma is nutty, with a quality I can't quite pinpoint. Almost like a chocolate malted milkshake. Very little hops going on there. The flavor is strong on roasted malt, with some very evident chocolate notes. A bit of english walnut slides in as well. Alcohol is very apparent on the finish, as is strong roasted coffee notes. Very flavorful and powerful for a brown. A bit of bitterness is also there, but it seems more like coffee bitterness than hops. The sweetness seems to come from the alcohol, but there is a big malt background to back this beer.","McMurray, Pennsylvania, USA","aaronh"

1993,"2003-09-22",3.7,"A very aromatic brown with a beautiful color and nice creamy head.  Excellent flavor - smooth and malty - but the alcohol content adds too much of a tang to finish.  I don't understand aracauna's comments below -- the nose-tickle at the end ruins the experience.  If the brewers would cut back on the Scotch Ale factor, this would be an excellent brown.  As it is, it's not worth the price.","USA","Yeastmaster"
1993,"2003-09-22",3.9,"Very dark brown with medium lasting head.  Nice maltiness at first blush but the hops definately kick up the finish.  Hoppier than most browns which makes it score high in my book.

1993,"2003-09-19",3.6,"Tastes like a brown with a lot of alcahol.  I was hoping this would have more body than a regular brown, but it doesn't really.  Nice creamy head.  Kind of nutty with apple tartness.  Finish is dry, and has a bit of cocoa.  I'm glad I bought a single and not the whole six pack considering the price.  The only brown I really enjoy so far is the Rogue Hazelnut.","Fallbrook, California, USA","Kasteelfreak"

1993,"2003-09-17",3.6,"Good stuff.
I am intrigued that they claim this is a combination of 3 styles.
I bought a ""Tackle Box"" sampler/variety case that Dogfish puts out and it's probably my favorite of all 4 in there.
I love Scotch ales, IPA and APA's so this is a logical fit .
The ABV is nice, don't have to drink a bunch to get your buzz on.
Brown for sure in color with a gentle lacey head and tease of alcohol vapor in the bouquet .
I'll buy more of this one i'm sure .","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","DubbelO7"
1993,"2003-09-09",3.9,"I was surprised at the reserved nature of this beer. Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent brown ale, but I was expecting something over the top from Dogfish Head. Actually, I guess a 7.2% brown ale is over the top, but you can't taste it. Alcohol is nowhere to be found in the aroma or flavor. The body is a nice clear rubied leather. The cream-colored head is thick and slow to subside. Nice texture. The aroma has a bit of chocolate and toffee, really malty with a slight hop bite underneath. The flavor is the same way, smooth creamy malts, a bit sweet, but the hops are present just enough to cut through the sweetness and leave this a very drinkable but still flavorful brown. The body is surprisingly thin given the alcohol content and huge maltiness of the flavor. Must be the brown sugar.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
1993,"2003-09-06",3.1,"Pours a very dark brown with a hint red woven in. Distinct coffee and caramel in the nose along with some subtle fruitness. Quite complex

1993,"2003-09-01",3.7,"Last week I drank this beer along with a 90 Minute IPA at the Dogfish Head brew pub down in Rehobeth Beach. I am not a big fan of brown ales but I really enjoyed this one. Or maybe I enjoyed it more because I was sitting at the bar in the Dogfish Head pub? I live about an hour and 20 minutes from the place and it was the first time I had been there. It's a great place. More like I had died and gone to heaven.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","Yankovitch333"

1993,"2003-08-12",3.3,"Bottled.  Poured a dark brown/black with barely any head.  The nose was like chocolate smoke.  The taste was like a hoppy carbonated coffee.  It was pleasant, but definately not a session beer.  Because of the thickness and alcohol content (7.2%), this beer is much better suited for the cold winter months.  I'll be sure to have some more this coming winter.","Ocala, Florida, USA","mribm"
1993,"2003-08-10",3.3,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2012 Pours a dark mahognay with a decent 2cm tan head which fizzles into some nice lace after a couple minutes.  Nose is sort carmelly.  Start is kinda of malty and theres some alcohol present too, while the finish smooths out into a more caramel flavor.  The carbonation is good, and the palate is medium.

1993,"2003-08-04",3.7,"This is an odd one but I liked it quite a bit. Hops and malt are quite evident in the aromas. Taste is sugary-malty hints of roasted and chocolate flavors.

1993,"2003-07-24",4.0,"One day I had a great idea:  to combine a brown ale and an IPA . . . but Dogfish Head beat me to the punch.    Dark brown, almost black, in color with a brown head.  Luscious aroma of big malts and hops.  Flavor is of rich, chewy malts, with the hops not coming through as much as I expected.

When agitated, beer gives a great off-white creamy head that quickly disapates to nothing.  Aroma is a rich, rich dark coffee-chocolate, molasses, caramel.

Interesting brew not really fitting any style, but still quite drinkable, grows on you.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1993,"2003-07-12",3.7,"Pretty deep brown color, rapidly diminishing head fades into almost nothing by the end of the beer.  Smells initially of brown sugar, but then the bitter malts kick in.  The taste reminds me in an odd way of Schmaltz's Alt.  There is a touch of sweetness, but then the bitter malts kick in, giving it an almost chocolate flavor.  Hops weave through this in an interesting manner.  There is also a tang in the aftertaste that is reminiscent of Guinness.  The thing that keeps this beer from getting a higher rating is that the aftertaste is completely dominated by this sour acidity.  My mouth now tastes like I did a shot of A1 steak sauce.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
1993,"2003-07-08",3.0,"When first tasting this, I was rather surprised at the hoppy zing prickling my tongue. Looking at the bottle I noticed that this has a bit of IPA in it...interesting for a ""brown""...but fair enough. This however grew a bit annoying as the Scotch aspect worked its way into the mix, providing a very musky malt that didn't compliment the hops as well as I would have hoped, in fact it made the hops appear as much more of a stark citrus intrusion then a complimentary addition. I must give my compliments on a reasonably decent attempt at combining all three of these very powerful flavors, it could just use a little tweaking that's all.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

Intricate lacing. Roasted coffee aroma and maybe a hint of citrusy sourness. Velvety smooth mouthfeel. Delicate but vigorous carbonation. Brown-sugary malts up front with a rising hint of dark chocolate. Alcohol is ever-so-slightly apparent. The hops assert themselves quite well in the finish.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

1993,"2003-02-10",3.8,"This was a refreshing surprise in many ways.  It is a very drinkable beer from Dogfish Head.  Not a single bottle that packs the kick of a six-pack, like Raison d'extra, nor a beer that you could right a masters thesis about, like World Wide Stout.  Just a really good, really drinkable beer.  Also, an American India Ale that is not so hopped that it coats your gums, or hopped to the max with orange, pine, and grapefruit with pacific north west varieties.  It  greats you with a dark reddish brown pour, almost clear, little head.  The nose says sweet malt and hops.  The mouth is a little thin.  The taste is nicely balanced between sweetness, malt, and classic floral European hops in moderation.  If the ABV were lower this would be an easy drinking session beer.  As it is, it is a really plesant brew.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"

Distinct dark brown appearance which is magenta red in the light. Heavy head..beige in color, but lacing heavily and remaining quite creamy..probably one of my favorite things about this beer. The taste itself is pretty complex. You have something to the effect of a caramelized roasted barley effect right on the tongue...my favorite part of this...nice malty finish. Something of a nut and wood flavor dance around too..and during the drinking is when the aroma of those Goldings really become apparent. A very smooth drink, a good smack of a bite..some roastiness and chocolate hidden in there, a nice dry, but not horribly dry finish.

1993,"2002-09-06",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 11, 2003 (draft) Clear mahogany with tan head.  Aroma is sweet, raisin, caramel, roasty.  Taste is medium sweet, malty, light caramel, roasty.  Wet, light/medium body.  (bottle) Very dark brown body with minimal head.  Rich caramel and chocolate malty sweet aroma, a bit of bitterness at the edges.  The taste is sweet but hoppy.  Assertive maltiness (caramel/chocolate/coffee), the brown sugar is evident as well.  The sweetness diminishes at mid-taste, and some spiciness and the English hops begin to assert themselves.  Alcohol is always at the periphery and finally makes itself known in the aftertaste.  Good beer, though taste- and strength-wise it's much more a doppelbock than a brown ale.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"

1993,"2002-09-01",4.2,"The 7.2% of alcohol in this beer is a hidden treasure.  A bonus of exceptional flavor is offered by this brown ale.  The head is a pillowy light brown foam that slowly dissapates into the robust caramel flavored froth.  The aroma immediately reminded me of nuts and caramel.  The taste is a very malty flavored creamy brown ale with no harsh aftertaste.  The appearance is a very rich brownish red favoring a traditional british bitter/brown ale. Smooth and creamy.  This beer would be great on a cool winters night with a hot bowl of oyster stew after an exhausting day of skiing and kicking back at the lodge.","Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania, USA","ARMed"
1993,"2002-08-28",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2006 (re-rate)Deep, dark garnet. So-so head. Decent nose of sweet caramel, hint of chocolate, resin and brown sugar. The caramel and sugar mix nicely with the roasted malt. The blast of goldings balance nicely and give the beer a very clean taste. ALthough its a bit sweet, its an unique and tasty concoction. These guys rock!","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"

Dark color with golden hues around the edge, fluffy beige head, dissipating a bit too quickly.  Balanced carbonation, smooth and good texture.  The flavor was more subdued than the aroma.  Hoppy bitterness in the finish, but only mildly and very pleasant.  Some coffee and caramel hints, event a taste of smoke at the first sip.  This hides its alcohol extremely well, with only a hint of it in the aroma (reference my comment about English strong ales, which tend to wear their alcohol on their sleeve).  Enjoyable and easy drinking.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

1993,"2002-08-01",3.3,"This beer has the right components, but just doesnt add up to the sum of its parts.  Maltiness is distinctly brown in character some chocolate.  Hops are assertive but sort of prevent any malt subtlety from shining through, kind of like someone ringing a bell constantly during some sort of event--distracting is the word Im looking for.

1993,"2002-07-12",3.9,"I think this is a great brown ale. Not as filtered as some of the other more dominate browns out there. Fortunately, that means a deeper more malted body, which is fine by me.

Great aroma that is a good mix of hops and fruit. The taste is odd, has a weird smokey, fruity, bubblegum taste that is slightly bitter.

I admired the good hop action of this beer, but was not a big fan of the rest of it.  The malt is busy, more sweetly muddy than complex, though.

Perhaps this is because of the high ABV for the style? The sweetness was a bit over the top for me, although it was nearly countered by the hop presence. Still, Im pretty sure Im nitpicking...in the world of browns, which some apparently do not go for, this is a more full-bodied, nearly creamy addition that satisfies.
