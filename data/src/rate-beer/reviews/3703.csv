3703,"2011-01-14",2.9,"This brew was just reintroduced at the Claybourn brewpub last Thursday. Poured into an Imperial pint glass from the cask.

4.5 A: Suprisingly clear deep amber color. Thick, super creamy head.

3.0 S: Bready, but not much else going on. Not really any yeast character.

3.5 T: Low hop profile. Bready, but overall very neutral.

4.0 M: Very light body, but silky smooth. This would have been a 5 if the body was a bit thicker.

3.5 D: Some good aspects and some bad make this an average, drinkable brew.

Serving type: cask

3703,"2009-07-18",3.6,"On tap at the GI Clybourn brewpub. Poured a deep red, with minimal aroma. Primarily hoppy taste. Reminded me of a less-strong IPA. I enjoyed it as an after-dinner drink.","Santa Barbara, California, USA","thelizard"
3703,"2009-07-10",3.6,"On tap at Goose Island Wrigleyville.  Deep rich red color, with small off-white head.  Aroma of roasted malt, mild citrus hops.  Taste is nutty, toasty caramel malt.  Crisp medium mouthfeel.","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","mattmc1973"
3703,"2009-06-30",3.1,"On tap at Goose Island Clybourn. Pours amber with a white head. Aroma is of grass, malt, light hops, and caramel. Taste is of grassy hops, grain, and pine. Has a bready malt backbone that evens the beer out. Lingering taste of caramel. Mouthfeel is light and heavily carbonated. Crisp and easy drinking, but nothing amazing.","Burbank, Illinois, USA","BeerBunker"
3703,"2008-08-06",3.5,"Draft at Clybourn. Poured a slightly hazy dark orange color with an off white head. Smelled of flowery/citrusy hops and a bit of graham cracker. Light to medium bodied and on the dry side. I tasted caramel, citrus fruits, and toasted bread. Decent enough.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"
3703,"2008-08-04",3.6,"draft at brewpub- quite tasty- Irish ale? That’s weird, because it’s touted as a hoppy amber, and tastes fairly piney and citrusy. Nice dry hoppyness to the brew. A patron at the bar tipped me off to a nice little drink- a pint of the ipa topped with the celebration. Good beer.","Williamsville, New York, USA","hopson"

3703,"2008-07-26",3.4,"draft at GI cly....pours a medium slightly hazy caramel brown with a thin wispy white head.... decent intermingling of caramel malt and grassy ops.  more of that crystal malt than hops...similar to the nose, a favorable balance of malt and a moderate degree of grassy bitterness in the finish.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
3703,"2008-07-20",3.2,"on tap at GI LPB. pours hazy amber with white head. nose has some nice hop notes of citrus and melon, some biscuity malt coming through too. flavor is citrusy with toasted malts. chewy, and the crystal malt used becomes cloying. pretty hopped up but not something i could drink more than a half pint of.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

3703,"2006-09-03",3.6,"Sampled at GI Clybourn location. Deep clear red with an off-white head. Fresh Cascade hop aroma with some toffee as well. Flavor has notes of toasted malt, pine and grapefruit/citrus. Moderately sweet, ends with a spicy hop finish. Very well-balanced. Medium bodied with a smooth texture and moderate carbonation. A very good session ale.","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"
3703,"2006-07-26",3.9,"On tap at Clybourn.  This was an excellent brew!  Poured a clear, deep iced tea/reddish brown with a tall, thick beige head.  Big Cascade feel upfront (pine and powerful grapefruit).. with airy caramel and toffee beneath... floral hops waft through as it warms.  Juicy grapefruit throughout.. with pine and more grapefruity bitterness around the mouth.  Pine tingliness at the finish leaves a lasting impression.  Sweet caramel malts provide the base, but remain in the background.  Medium-bodied and very smooth!  Ideal level of bitterness hits all the right place.  Fitting Celebration for #900!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3703,"2006-07-09",3.8,"Had this on cask and it was quite a good beer.  Not sure I would classify this as an irish ale.  Id say it was more of an apa, maybe an amber ale.  Anyways, a good amount of citrusy grapefruit in there and a good malt balance.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
3703,"2005-08-19",4.0,"Clear red.  Great nose, sweet, lots of citric hops with a touch of fresh-cut grass.  Nice flavor, initially quite sweet, then bitter.  Hops are somewhat citric, but get a bit more of a woody hop to it as well.  Great palate, very creamy and sticky.  Could drink plenty of this one.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
3703,"2005-08-08",3.7,"Clear copper-red with a grayish wisp formation for the head.  Aroma leads in with brown sugar, maple, molasses, hops and caramelized honey-roasted peanuts.  Nice nutty malt complex lends a nice flavor profile.  Pecans, hazelnuts and a quaff rounding out with freshly cracked walnuts.  Caramel rolls in to sweeten it a bit with hopping efforts working to liven the palate feel.  Can easily rest on its laurels as a top-notch Irish ale.  Enjoyable stuff.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
3703,"2005-07-30",3.8,"Cask at clybourn pub. Poors deep red with creamy white head. Sharp, hoppy aroma. Nice malt sweetness on the tongue balanced by significant, lasting hoppiness. Good red, hoppy beer.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","htsprint1"
3703,"2005-07-28",3.2,"This is a nicely hopped up Irish ale.  Hazy copper with an off-white head, the grapefruit hop aroma and taste dominate the light caramel sweetness.  In the cask consitioned version, the hops are somewehat muted, especially in the aroma.

3703,"2005-07-27",3.6,"Soapy nose.  Floral and perfume.  Smooth, but super, super bitter.  I mean like a thousand bitters thrown in your face in a bitter storm.  Holy hops Batman!  Yes, I would say this is crazily hopped.  Oddly, a very short finish.  Leaves the palate fairly quickly.  Some maltiness upfront, but mostly gets left in teh dust by the hops.  Not really dead on Irish Ale, but still I enjoyed it quite a bit.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
3703,"2005-07-25",3.5,"On tap @ Clybourn location; with Celebration in the name I couldnt stop thinking of a SNCA.   This beer shares the ""other"" Celebrations ruby color and cascade hop flavor.   However, GIs Celebration had more of a caramel malt sweetness.  I would have never guessed this was an Irish ale and not an IPA.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","JFGrind"
3703,"2005-07-23",3.5,"On tap at clybourn... Poured a rich amber/red with a generic off white head. Aromas were hops, caramel and hints of spice, with a little fruit showing as it warmed. Mouthfeel was just a bit watery but the flavor was still there. Perhaps a possible session beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ceejmomeechmo"

3703,"2004-09-08",3.7,"Pint glass from the Clybourn pub.  Served lukewarm which I actually liked.  Very nice balance and color.  A little watery.  Hop aroma, slight hop flavor but hard to tell since this was one of the last of the night.  Clean finish.","Illinois, USA","doubletriple"
3703,"2004-08-01",3.5,"Centennial hops galore, this is a nice irish ale with plenty of toasty and caramelly malts to complement the strong hops.  Smooth, refreshing and, as always, super fresh at the source!!","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
3703,"2004-07-05",3.3,"Definitely better than their higher volume Kilgubbin. As far as reds go, I prefer them to drinking a lot of other styles. This one, I feel I could sit back and drink at least a few of and not be pissed about doing that. At the same time, this one doesnt bring a lot to the table. Perhaps a dimmed down Honkers? Who knows. Tastes lightly of hops, not as much as youd expect given the description. Kind of made me sad to find out that they were using Cascades but not exploiting them. Oh well. Still, nice looking beer that you could drink and enjoy.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
3703,"2004-07-05",3.0,"a good for the style.  a lot hoppier that the killgubbins.  actually tasted a lot like a darker red version of honkers ale","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SkyinBrian"
3703,"2004-07-02",3.5,"5 oz sample at the brewpub.  Translucent, deep red; clean, balanced nose, strongly hoppy.  Balanced, clean smoothly malty body, quite hoppy for style I think.  Pine, grapefruit, a bit of oak..the usual suspects.  Little hard at the finish; refreshing.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
3703,"2004-06-29",3.3,"Draft, at Goose Island. This batch was made just with Centennial hops as part of GIs Single Hop Summer. Despite a caramel-red appearance under a thin head, this still has a light mouthfeel, with the hops starting out flowery and peppery, then becoming more assertive in bitterness as I work my way down the glass. Theres actually some alcohol warmth coming in, too.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
3703,"2004-06-23",3.8,"Nice hoppy aroma. Cloudy dark orange with an off-white head. Sublte malt and featuring a low to moderate hop profile. A nice beer.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
3703,"2004-06-14",3.9,"(On cask, single-hopped 2004 edition, GI Clybourn) Im a sucker for centennial hops, so this really caught me. Grassy, citrusy hop nose; quite sweet in flavor with a good dose of hop bitterness and floral notes off the centennials.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
3703,"2004-06-12",2.9,"Cask pull at Clybourn.  This one changed over the time I drank it, and it was pretty tepid when I got it, so I dont think it was due to temperature change.  Color lives up to the name, ruby red, sparkling, with a small white head.  At first, it seemed characterless, with a nice bitterness (but the same bitter hops that I taste in most Goose Island beers).  As the beer drained, though, the taste became a blend of black cherry and bubblegum, which was nice with the hoppy finish.  At first, I would say it was not special.  Maybe as I got drunker, it got better.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"
3703,"2003-12-10",3.2,"This was cask conditioned.  Amber reddish coloring with a lsight head.  Light herbal aroma.  Plalte was also light at first and then there was a bit of a ""bite"" from the grapefruit, slightly astrigent which lingers at the end.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","Shadrach"
3703,"2003-08-02",3.5,"Light cedar colour, may be closer to straw than red, slightly transparent with a lingering creamy head.  Strong, sweet candy hop aroma with a great balance of malt.  Good even flavours of toasty hops and sweet caramel malt.  Clean and wet on the palate with a nice lingering bitter finish.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
3703,"2003-07-11",3.3,"Amber colored with an off-white head.  Caramel, nut and lightly toasted malt provides a decent sweet start, before being brutally removed from the scene by strong pine, grapefruit and spicy hops.  Really not all that great.  Just sort of a run of the mill red with strong hops and little malt.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
3703,"2003-07-02",3.3,"(cask):  Clear ruby with minimal off-white head.  Aroma is pleasant herbal hoppy.  Taste is medium sweet up top before turning herbal and grapefruit hoppy.  Smooth medium body with minimal carbonation.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"

(On Cask)
Crystal clear, burnt orange brew. Quite beautiful. No head.
The nose is piney and peppery. Notes of leather and English toffee.
The flavor is malty with hints of butterscotch.  Nice, evergreen-laden, acrid hop presence.
Flat, medium-bodied brew with an oily mouthfeel. Lengthy, astringent finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3703,"2003-07-01",3.4,"Tap-Goose Island Clybourn-RBSG-6/29/03.  I sat right next to bigbadbear63 when we sampled this.  We had similar agreements on this beer, but my ratings will not be as good as his.  Dark, Ruby red appearance with good lacing.  Aroma was full of citrus/lemon.  palate was very one dimensional and thin-all hops, no malt.  Would be excellent if the body was a bit thicker.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
3703,"2003-06-29",3.8,"Reddish hue with an average head and good lacing, thin to medium-bodied. Nice tart (grapefruit) and mild malt aroma, much like a newborn port. Woody and citrusy taste, lingering malt aftertaste. Thin and lively mouthfeel. A nice brew not to be confused with the standard Goose red.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
