Aroma is pretty typical for the style, dark roasted malts, strong cocoa, a touch of alcohol, wood, molasses, dark fruits, in particular plum. The taste is pretty standard too, the cocoa, tobacco, dark fruits, all trademarks of the style are here, but the pomegranate really adds a nice tartness that sets this one apart, and that tartness follows through to the finish.

Je ne sens que très peu les épices. Cest ça n bouche que ces dernières prennent véritablement leur envol. En effet, celles-ci occupent une place trop importante à mon goût et tranchent trop agressivement les saveurs crémeuses et équilibrées qui font le reste de la bière. Texture crémeuse presque huileuse véhiculant de la noix, encore du fruit, une note qui me rappelle la fraise des champs et même lérable grâce à la mélasse. Dommage pour la fin de bouche épicées.

Came here specifically for this beer. Had the 23 version and was hoping this would be just as good. Cant remember the details of that one, but I know it was in Spokane and fantastic.

Poured a very dark brown color with 1-to- fingers of fizzy head when I got it. Thinned out rather quickly. A few bubbles were coming up from the bottom. Below, wet lacing. Bad retention. (Sigh - 3.25)

Smelled smooth bourbon, molasses, licorice, dark fruit - purple grape and plum - toffee, caramel, buttery malts, hazelnut and a touch of floral hops. It got a bit boozy late. (Smell - 4.00)

Tasted close to the smell, but better. Got smooth bourbon, rich molasses, hazelnut, caramel, toffee, dark cocoa, black licorice, cold pressed black coffee, espresso, vanilla, plum and chocolate syrup. (Taste - 4.25)

Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish. (Feel - 4.75)

It comes off as being a little charred and rough though, which is a departure from the seamless barrel to beer iterations of the previous years. Booze is evident. Cherry hard candy and cough syrup. Further warming reveals overripe banana, and even further warming reveals General Tsaos chicken, while further warming reveals the reviled green bell pepper. This just keeps getting worse. Flavor is very sweet and sappy with plenty of chocolate, pomegranate, apricot, char, and oak. Nothing really here to clean up the sweetness and it just kind of hangs there.

Finish is rather smooth and the flavor lingers around a bit. It was OK but not really my style. Ive had worse. Overall it was good and not too harsh if this is what you like.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","jsporrer"
1498,"2015-10-10",3.7,"Bomber to snifter (shared with the Mrs.). Looks good; a fairly opaque dull dark cola with foamy lighter beige head. Smells of dark malt, cocoa, fruit, vanilla, molasses, oak, and spices. Tastes like it smells with a pleasant medium full-bodied mouthfeel with some mild tartness from the fruit. A bit of bourbon when exhaling through the nose.  Smooth for the abv.  Good beer.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
1498,"2015-10-10",3.9,"From tap @ 38 Degrees Alehouse. Color is black, but not quite opaque. Light brown head, a bit frothy, good lacing. Aromas: brown sugar, red fruit, light wood, sweet.

Better with every sip....","Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","PotjeBier"
1498,"2015-10-09",4.4,"probably my favorite BB right out of the gate. While some have needed time (and last years was my least favorite) thisis just fantastic. A little boozier, in a good way, thanks to the amped up percentage in bourbon. Sweet and ever so slight tartness from apricot and pomegranate, and a plethora of coffee, chocolate and roasted malt too. Great sipper!","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
1498,"2015-10-06",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 7, 2015 22oz bottle, from Dutchs. Labeled 11.6%, best after: 7/20/16. Nearly pitch black color. Thin khaki head, leaving good ropes and ridges of lace. Bigger roast malt, some vanilla, bit of bourbon heat. Dark chocolate, and a really interesting, nice pleasant kind of rich fruitiness. Some of the brightness of the apricot seems mildly noticeable, in a heavily chocolate-covered apricot kind of way. Plenty of dark chocolate here. Bigger body. Kind of crisp, lighter carbonation. Great thicker chewiness to the texture. Mild slick, then finishing off dry quickly, with some pleasant alcohol warmth. Bigger sweet taste but doesnt bother me too much here. Has a nice big satisfying moderate to bigger bitter taste, too. Some pleasant bit of coffee in the aftertaste. Great BA porter.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

1498,"2015-10-03",4.1,"Aroma of wet brownie mix with vanilla and a touch of sweetend applesauce, slightest touch of soft sourdough bread, some strawberry jam. Appears like coffee with a thin ring of light caramel foam, spotty lace. Nice bitter sweet balance for a high abv brew that hides the alchohol well, almost tastes like an oreo cookie with maple syrup sweetening it up a bit, there is a light lingering alcohol on the end, a bit of burnt campfire marshmellow. Texture is thick, a bit oily, but still lightly fizzy. Overall, very good, top tier brew.","Redford, Michigan, USA","Petkus331"

Aroma was a nice bourbon and chocolate mix initially. A bit of spice and fruit came out as it warmed. Taste had the bourbon and chocolate, but the mix of fruit and alcohol gave a brandy type flavor that was very good. The spice seemed to come in the finish and was just the right amount.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
1498,"2015-09-30",4.1,"Black waxed bomber pours with a deep dark body that supports a thin mocha colored head. The aroma offers up chocolate and boozy spirits and then smooth smelling blueberry and concord grape like fruity esters. As it warms some dark roasted malts and molasses sweetened spicy wood join the experience. The taste delivers smooth rich chocolate and boozy bourbon to start. Toward midway notes of sweet berry and prune like fruity esters blend with dark roasted malts and sweetened spicy wood. It remains very chocolate and dark roasted malts and spicy wood right into the finish. Solid.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

1498,"2015-09-20",4.0,"22 oz bottle shared by ebone1988. We had some great laughs talking about the influence of rose water in the brewing process. Things like how it tickled your olfactory receptors or how your testicles ascended, stuff like that. The pour is a nice light black with a creamy tan head and some soapy lace. The aroma is really fruity. There is a lot of apricot purée and a light roast. The molasses is sweet and there is a little barrel. The toast and char is nice, but I wish there was a little more vanilla. The flavor is a little thin. There is a nice fruitiness but the cocoa nibs are pretty absent. The molasses adds a little more sweet fruitiness but the barrel influence really falls off. The mouth feel is light, but creamy with a nice carbonation and a lingeringly fruity finish
