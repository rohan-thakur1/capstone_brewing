Ins Glas ergießt sich ein schönes dunkelbraunes Weizen mit angemessener Trübung und hoher, standhafter Krone. Der Geruch ist säuerlich röstig. Der Antrunk erfolgt dezent sauer, angenehm fruchtig, mit leichter Röstnote im Hintergrund. Der Abgang ist wieder röstig, etwas Karamell spielt mit, die Säuerlichkeit nimmt hier enorm ab.","Merzkirchen, RLP, GERMANY","Grima"

798,"2010-12-04",3.7,"Very nice dunkelweizen! So crisp in the aroma, such a spice attack! Big on clove, pepper, and bubblegum, moderate banana in comparison. Yeast is the most amazing thing, isnt it? Great sweet waves in the aroma, with alternating strong  sweet and sour flavors. Effervescent breadiness; liquid sugar, bread and spices. But a whole that is not that sweet and very challenging in the palate throughout. What more do I want in this kind of beer? Really easy to drink.

798,"2010-01-03",3.5,"500ml bottle (OPP, Helsinki. German Weeks 2009)
Sweet spiky banana aroma, some caramel later. Pleasant carbonation, and quite a retronasal ester kick. Touch of sludginess, but less than many dunkelhefeweizens. In fact, this is fairly crisp. Some burntness in places - nice. Finish is green hops, likewise very pleasant.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

798,"2003-09-06",3.6,"Dark brown, totally hazy; dense beige head. Nice nose, nutty, warm-alcoholic, Münich malt, estery. Taste is estery again, spicy (cloves, cardamom, even cinnamon) and fruity (banana, ripe pears). I'm convinced I can taste higher alcohols. Dark bread, as Jonas says, indeed, a sweet one with rum and eggs. Balanced by a wheaty acidity. Well-bodied, warming even. The last will be the first.
