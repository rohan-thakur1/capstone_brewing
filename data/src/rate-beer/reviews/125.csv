125,"2016-02-10",5.0,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2016 At Matts place. 2012 vintage. Very intensive aroma with a touch of alcohol, perry and apples. No alcohol in the taste, very sweet, it seems that you are drinking oil with perry taste. Incredible... 1st thing I have rated as 5.0 on RateBeer :-)","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","beerplace"
125,"2016-02-10",3.9,"Bottle - Vintage 2012 - Green apple and light acidic notes. Clear gold. Sweet, light fruit and lots of syrupy notes. No specific apple notes, but a nice syrupy sweetness.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
125,"2016-02-10",4.2,"200mL bottle, pours a clear golden with no head. Aroma screams out loads of pear, followed by candied sugar. Flavour brings out loads of fresh juicy mangoes, followed by pears. Absolutely no acidity whatsoever. Impeccably balanced and wonderfully crafted. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
125,"2016-02-10",4.1,"Corked bottle; vintage 2012Golden color. The aroma of pear is very intense, even on the cork, stewed pears, liquor. Extremely sweet, thick, candy like, with pear and caramelized pineapple, mango, and a hint of fresh hazelnuts in the final; moderate acidity.Elegant, if not as deep as some apple based Ice Ciders. But its an excellent one.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
125,"2015-11-08",4.1,"Thanks to ineedbeer. 200ml bottle with fancy wax(?). The cider is a bright, medium light amber color. Its quite clear. Theres no head, of course. Appears fairly viscous. The aroma is bright and fruity. Full of pear, apple goodness. Its closer to a cooked pear dessert flavor than the raw pear that I expected. Some pineapple juice, light caramel, candied apple, rose. The taste is sweet but not as much as most ice ciders that Ive tried. Its a bit more acidic. Wonderfully full on the palate. It really shows off the fruit flavor. Its just concentrated pear joy. I dont feel great at describing these ice ciders, but this is another absolutely delicious example.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
125,"2015-11-07",4.1,"Poured from a bottle courtesy of tom10101. 
Aroma is wonderful with bright fruit notes of pears and red apple. Some tropical fruit notes with a light alcohol spice. A nice honey note as well. 
Pours a brilliantly clear, sparkling gold with no head or carbonation. Nice long legs. 
Flavor has a moderately strong sweetness, but not as sweet as some other ice ciders. Nice pear flavors with some lighter apple like notes. A bit of a spice character with light alcohol spice. A touch of tropical fruit. Some lingering sweetness. Some honey notes.
Mouthfeel is slightly sticky but also very silky. Light alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a really nice ice perry. Rich fruit notes with good sugars. Delicious!","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
125,"2015-07-09",4.2,"Sample. Bright clear gold pour. Aroma is exotic, nice tropical aromas, light cinnamon-caramel, caramelized pear, probably the best pear aroma Ive had from an ice perry. Taste is sweet, liquory, very rich, tongue tickling sweetness, nice round pear flavor, rich lingering vanilla caramel. Palate is full bodied, mouth coating like it should be. An excellent offering.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
