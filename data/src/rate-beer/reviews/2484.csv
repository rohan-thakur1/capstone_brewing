The pour is a nice ruby tinted golden yellow with a nice pillowy white head and a couple spots of lace as it falls to a bubbly collar. The aroma is strange. It smells like the fermentation of beer outside of Founders. It's a sweet potato malt that really comes through. It's not bright and hoppy, nor does it carry the metallic lager tendency. The flavor is not hoppy at all. There is a strong malt presence that comes through in a dominating fashion. The sweet potato malts are hugely present and there is a touch of bitterness on the finish. The mouth feel is heavy and syrupy for what it should be. There is minimal carbonation present. This thing just hangs when it should be bright and sharp.

2484,"2015-06-16",3.9,"From 12oz bottle, from variety pack, poured into tulip glass

Aroma: Citrus, cascade, American ""c"" hops

Appearance: Golden/copper, hazy, off white/tan head

Taste: Medium bitter

Palate: light to medium body, sticky texture, average carbonation, bitter finish

Overall: Cant believe I havent rated this. Ive had a lot of this and think its a great American IPA-like lager. I remember enjoying this more in my previous sessions than this bottle. A very nice American hop profile with a solid malt backbone. Very easy to drink and not harsh or too bitter. Nice dry and clean finish, but feels like its lacking something. Aroma is quick to fade. A very solid beer and better than most American IPAs on the market.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","jamesewelch"
2484,"2015-06-13",3.4,"355 ml bottle bought at The Bottle Shop in Sai Kung.
Looks: Translucent amber honey colour; One-quarter finger head and soapy white foam which fades in 40 seconds; Excellent sticky lacing with very slight carbonation. 

Aroma: Fragrant malt, with strong floral, passion fruits, oranges, very light grapefruit, molasses, pine, light resin, spices, light crackers, strong lemon and fresh grass.

Taste: Close to medium sweet malt, with strong lemon peels, grapefruits, strong molasses, earth, light pine, strong resin, strong biscuits, strong lime, strong bitter hops and fresh grass.

Body: Mid to light. Slick, thick and oozy palate. 

Mouth Feel: Pretty rich maltyness, quite thick and slick. The rich hops make it almost Ale-like. The strong citrusy and oozy taste suggest 3Cs, though the grapefruits and pine is rather low, mostly lime, earth, fair resin and spices. Expressive but not out of control. Neat! 

Hoppiness: Passion fruits, oranges, very light grapefruit, floral, light pine, resin in nose. Strong lime, lemon peels, light citrus, ooze, light pine and earth in taste. Bitterness is notably strong but short-lived, for an abrupt, moderate to strong bitter-sweet finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Very limey and quite bitter to mouth.

Comments: The 3Cs or whatever West Coast hops being put into this IPL give me a feeling of its hands being tied - its citrusy and resiny aroma and taste are notablely neat, but perhaps a bit too restrained to be fully impressive. Very nice to have one no doubt, but for now this is above average but not great.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

First sip is lathered with wet, juicy, oily, piney hops. Somewhat grassy, almost floral, & most definitely pungent. On the edge of dank, but not quite there. Light resinous attack, too. The latter half reveals a larger fruit essence of pineapple, grapefruit, & herbal lemon tea leaves. Modest essence of crackery & bread laden malts, however the bitterness of the hops sustains much further into the finish than the malts, leaving a mild white pepper spiciness on the tongue after each sip.

2484,"2014-09-26",3.5,"From Bottle Shop. Pours an almost-clear bright light orange with watery white head. Smells of dry bitter piney hop, wet crisp malt, bit of cinnamon pepper spice. Tastes (as advertised) like a hoppy lager - quite bitter but crisp. Taste doesnt last long. Body is thin in a way that complements a lager - the spiciness also prevents it from feeling thin. Good and is nicely very bitter though the taste is a little boring (almost seems a waste of hop). Solid beer though.","HONG KONG","CacheManyHose"
2484,"2014-09-26",3.7,"Bottle from Bottle Shop at home. Translucent light amber. Minimal head. Aroma is very yeasty with strong grassy hops. Taste is bready like a sourdough with very strong hops for a lighter lager - bitter and grassy with pine. Crisp finish which is really nice. Very balanced. Only flaw would be the slightly one note hops flavor. Much better than the Sam Adams Double Agent IPL which is also good but not as hoppy. Would definitely get again.","HONG KONG","HKdIPA"

The taste is hoppy and gives a bit of bitterness with orange rind and earthy, leafy greens. There is a touch of tangerine, passion fruit and even some lemon-like flavor for a moment. The malts then steer into more biscuit flavor and some saltine flavor is there before bitterness is rained down over the back-end.

The body of the beer is smooth and the earthy yeast seems to give it texture. It has ample carbonation but those bubbles do not bite you. The citrus is flower like. The grapefruit is soft and so is the pine. The light malt is perfectly unobtrusive but carries this beer expertly with a light grain in the aftertaste. Its caressed by a gently bitter but even that is restrained. Smart and poised.

2484,"2013-11-04",4.0,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. There was no discernible freshness date. It cost $2.69 ($0.22 per ounce).

Appearance: A hazy, but bright shade of glowing peach flesh yellow/orange. No carbonation visible (which is odd considering its a lager). Pours to a large, white, frothy head which laces and retains very well.

Smell: Citrus and dank resin pine. Hints of garlic and other seasonings. 

Taste: Something Ive come to discover in 2013 is that theres a distinct ""New England Style"" IPA that smells and tastes of citrus or tropical fruit at first, but with a spicy vegetable flavor on the finish. Jacks Abbey Hoponius Union is very much in line with the style, though in this case the beer is actually a strong lager and not an ale. However, if that hadnt been indicated on the label, I doubt I (or most drinkers) would have made the distinction. 

The base palette here is pretty standard American IPA territory: citrusy hops up front that transition into something more dank and resiny at the peak and then finish with a slightly garlic or onion-like flavor. Many others of the regional style tend to be much stronger than this, though I actually appreciate the fact the intensity is a bit dialed-down here. Theres a slight sweetness riding along the entire time, imparting a honey or butterscotch-like flavor. The herbal component of the hops linger, creating for a slightly dry, slightly spicy sensation. Its not too intense or distracting, so it seems like an appropriate ending.

Drinkability: At 6.7% ABV and 65 IBUs, Jacks Abbey Hoponius Union is a perfect example of what an easy-drinking hoppy beer should be. Its flavorful and energetic in the mouth, but not so strong or obese that its a challenge to drink. The mouthfeel is surprisingly calm and smooth for a lager. Probably a great beer to pair with any dinner, though enjoying it on its own is quite satisfying.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

2484,"2013-09-05",4.0,"My Bottom Line :  
This crisp and floral India Pale Lager showcases quenching citrusy angles in a slender and truly satisfying body.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A sheet of foam sits atop the misty gold.
-If I could fault it for something, it is that malts could be a tad more expressive in the flavor profile. As is, they mostly support the engaging hop profile.
-This could not be more drinkable for a 6%+ brew.
-Sandy notes (cat litter to some) are intimated here and there.
-Wooden resins seal each sip.

A: Pours a clear golden yellow color with a fluffy white head forming on the pour. It recedes slowly to thin ring. Some splotchy lace is left down the glass.

S: Lager yeast profile with a light hoppiness to it. Subtle pale malts in the periphery.

In long: Nose is fresh, clean and bight citusy hops.  Taste has clean fresh cereals, a whole lot of citusy hops, notes of pine needles, some citric notes.  Very clean bitterness of medium-high intensity.  There is something I really about how citrusy hops come out in a lager (both in the aroma and taste), it comes out cleaner, with more definition.

The beer is clear and golden hued with a small head that leaves sparse lacing on the tulip. Lots of fresh hop character in both the nose and taste. This drinks much more like an IPA than a German lager. And while this beer is tasty, it does lack the distinctive characteristics of a Dortmunder lager. The body is light and the finish is dry, offering a hint of lager yeast. Overall, a tasty brew. Easy to drink and flavorful, just dont expect an authentic example of the style. I would definitely have this again.

2484,"2012-06-18",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2013 Pours crystal clear orange. Nose is bright citrus, and pleasant mild tropical fruit some sweet malts and floral and slight grassy hops. Flavor is ultra clean with a nice blend of light orange, grapefruit and mangos, a touch of peaches, spice, and some resinous dankness-almost a sweet orange juice character in there as well. Smooth mouthfeel and caramel malts are easy and light. Really nice beer! Cant really tell its a lager but whatever. Stands up well against the rest of the great IPAs. Thanks to Alec","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","wnoble"
2484,"2012-06-17",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2012 Draft with Linh and Scarlett at picco in Boston. Pours a light orange body with carbonated, white head. Aroma is grassy and bitter citrus. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing with notes of grass hops, bitter citrus, light floral flavors and a zesty earthiness. RERATE:::: Growler at Franks with Dallas, Vinny, Alan, Bill and Frank. Pours a light orange body with nice haze and white head and lots of lacing. Aroma is fresh citrus, freshly cut grass, light pine and a light lager grain. Mouthfeel is super fresh and earthy. Awesome + 0.4.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2484,"2012-06-17",4.0,"Thanks to J for bringing this treat. Smells of citrusy hops, some resin, light sweet malt backbone. Initially lightly sweet, then some the hop flavors appear after that appears a light bitterness that is dry and delicate. This beer is wonderfully carbonated and smooth. This is a very well make beer - hopefully I will get a chance to try more of their beers on trips back to the US.","Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, ENGLAND","ThirstyBird"
2484,"2012-06-02",3.9,"Bottle.  This is a unique beer and remarkably hoppy.  Looks pretty standard and the palate feels fresh (this was bottled within the last week or three).  But the aroma is a huge Northwest hop bomb of resin, very ripe tropical fruit, and catty funk.  Love it.  The flavor is sticky sweet and alpha acid and hop bitterness.  In the middle and end the lager character comes out as the body thins and turns sticky.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"
2484,"2012-05-13",3.6,"Pours a light clear yellow with minimal head. Smells really hoppy, pine, grapefruit and citrus, taste has a very balanced hop profile with a very good clean finish, lager yeast gives it a bready flavor. Really interesting and pretty good.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Smurf2055"
2484,"2012-05-01",3.9,"Pours gold into a Sam glass. White head with medium retention recedes to hug rim. Sweet cookie dough, caramel, weed and citrus aromas. Medium balanced with sweet caramel upfront turning to mild resin before the lasting grapefruit finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
2484,"2012-04-12",3.3,"Draft. Served in a tulip, great lace, sheets down the side of the glass. Light Co2. Nose is tons of fruit.  Taste is mostly clementine oranges. Citrus, spicy hops dominate the palate, malt plays second fiddle. Gets significantly more bitter as it warms. Lingering spicy hops. Cool concept in a cold fermented IPA","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2484,"2012-02-25",3.9,"On tap at Battleship.  Pours a clear golden color with a thick bubbly head.  Aroma is of fresh hops, weeds, and grain.  Flavor is similar. Hops, orange, and lime really take charge here.  Very clean and crisp beer.","Fall River, Massachusetts, USA","halfonit"
2484,"2012-02-05",3.6,"GLBN IPA Challenge 2012, liher straw colored pour. Citrusy IPA?? Impy Pils? Grapefruit pith. Good flavor, solid beer","Buffalo, New York, USA","swoopjones"
2484,"2012-02-04",4.1,"Huge thanks to Reagan1984 for getting this growler out my way. Served in a mug since Ive packed all my lager glassware pre-move.

Pours a clear light golden color with a nice white head and some spotty lacing as it goes down. Thin collar throughout. The nose brings some nice tropical fruits with a bit of citrus and resin there as well. The flavor profile is along the same line and is really fantastic. Beautiful fruits and a nice hoppiness throughout. Moderate bitterness throughout and a dry finish. Body is fairly light. Finish is fantastic. This is a very, very impressive beer.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
2484,"2011-12-25",4.2,"This was the first JA beer I tried a few months ago, and it was love at first sip.  Its a unique combination of a crisp lager with a huge grassy hop profile that competes with the best IPAs.  I have been impressed with other JA beers since, but this is the flagship that will distinguish them as they broaden the distribution.","Massachusetts, USA","philvil"
2484,"2011-11-18",4.0,"growler... dark gold, a bit of copper, nice color, off white head, good retention... smells like a hopped lager, reminds me of humulus lager, tastes like it as well, super easy to drink very flavorful... excellent lager","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
2484,"2011-11-02",3.5,"Pours a clear light copper color, decent foamy head.  Hop nose shows plenty of hop character, though nothing really new or unique.  Plenty of citrus and resinous notes.  Flavor follows- solid hop profile showing lots of citrus and pine notes.  Mild bitterness throughout.  Body has enough weight to carry the hops without lending too much sweetness.  Very good beer, an entirely worthwhile east-cost hoppy brew.","framingham, Massachusetts, USA","twitcher"
2484,"2011-09-23",4.0,"Fantastically tasty IPL(India pale lager).  A huge citrus bomb which tasted very fresh and delightful on tap at a hipster bar.  Grapefruit, orange, grass, and a unique quality that made it interesting which is probably the result of the lager yeast.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
2484,"2011-09-22",3.4,"A golden Imperial Pils with a thin lacing white head. In aroma, sweet butterscotch with light vanilla notes. In mouth, a smooth grassy hops with green apple skin, grainy malt, alcohol warmth, smooth and interesting. On tap at Sunset Grill, Sept. 11 2011.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
2484,"2011-09-19",4.0,"Very citrusy aroma, clean super hoppy flavors. Very fun fresh beer, very hoppy flavors and without much bitterness. Delisious","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
2484,"2011-09-13",4.3,"Every once in a while you pick a beer of a list with no idea what to expect.  This was one of those times and boy did it pay off well.  Even my IPA-averse girlfriend thought this was great.  Pours a clear gold with soft pillowy head.  Huge hop aromas - citrus, tropical fruits, apricot, resin running the show.  Stiff malt backbone.  Beautifully balanced, crisp, drinkable.  Enjoy how it evolves as it slowly warms up.","Alberta, CANADA","thb"
2484,"2011-08-27",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 4, 2011 On draft at brewery. This is my favorite of all the Jack brews. Very similar to an IPA in aroma and taste but actually a lager. Huge hop aroma up front with an excellent hop taste throughout. Got me a growler to go for further study.",", Massachusetts, USA","BroSpud"
2484,"2011-08-21",4.3,"Pours pale golden and clear.  Wonderful aroma of resin, floral, and citrus as good as any double IPA.  Well balanced and delicious, the hops flavor is front and center without overpowering biterness.  This is a great beer that is my favorite from this brewer.","Massachusetts, USA","Joel"
2484,"2011-08-19",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 18, 2012 On tap.  Pale yellow in color.  Has a hint of hop/citrus aroma.  This beer has a nice balance of maltiness, bitterness and aroma hops.  The citrus hop flavor is fairly prominent relative to typical IPAs, which I like very much.  The light carbonation made this smooth and easy to drink.  Very good, overall.

Update for a bottled version I just tried- the hop aroma was much stronger and fantastic.  Maybe it was fresher than the tap version I last sampled.  +2 points on aroma.","Massachusetts, USA","sailracer"
2484,"2011-08-06",4.5,"On tap at the brewery. Dense and intense aroma of fresh crushed citrus, gooey pine resin, and florals all melded together beautifully. The flavors are just as sharp and alive. This is so, so, so, so much better than 90% of all hoppy beers on the market and embarrasses most IPAs in terms of hop flavor and textural balance. Crisp, pungent, and lively. The flavors marry so well, into that explosive, rich emergent hop flavor that Im always looking for in good Double IPAs. I thought it was so good, we left the tasting room and went out to find a bar that had it to get a full pour. Exceptional hop brewing!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
