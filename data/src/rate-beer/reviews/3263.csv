3263,"2014-01-02",3.4,"UPDATED: JUL 8, 2015 Reconsidering this after a year, much better tripel than originally rated. Big and buttery, malt, savory spice, slick and smooth.","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"
3263,"2009-07-30",4.0,"Growler courtesy of ditmier.  Pours a hazy amber with a nice white head.  Smells of dry pilsner malt, spice, some clove, coriander, ginger, perfumy.  Tastes dry and crisp with some nice spicy elements, pepper, some citrus on the finish.  Very enjoyable.  Hopefully someday theyll bottle this!","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
3263,"2008-08-05",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 10, 2009 Draught @ Pie Hole Fairview - Poured opaque orange/brown with a small off white head...aroma is all bread with a bit of citrus, flavour follows, yeast, spice, great alcohol, malt and bitter balance...this was a killer suprise..too bad the pizza there tasted like shit...","Boise, Idaho, USA","ditmier"
3263,"2008-07-29",4.2,"Tap @ the Pie - This pours a hazy dare I say murky pour that is golden and has that unfiltered appearance that makes the color shapeshift a bit.  Nose, s really fruity and spicy.  Creamy carbonation flows over the palate, with a delicious mouthfeel. Really wheaty cereal grain maltiness, with lovely hints of citrus an yeasty notes.  Delicious!","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"
3263,"2007-01-24",4.0,"AKA Triple Pie at Flying Pie on Fairview:  Murky tan pour with a smaller head.  Nose of yeast and fruits.  Taste is fruity, yeast, some cloves.  Very well blended flavors make this smooth and true to style.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
3263,"2007-01-14",3.9,"On tap Boise Flying Pie. Pours out a Hazy tan topped with a small head. aroma of some hop and yeast. Tast a little like a Hez. Pretty good overall","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
3263,"2006-05-07",3.5,"Pours a hazy golden brownish color.  Aromas of hops, fruit, and a little yeast.  Has a light lemony taste, with some yeasty notes, and a good hop flavor.","Fort Walton Beach, Florida, USA","oldrtybastrd"
3263,"2006-04-29",3.2,"On Tap at  Flying Pie on Fairview.  They call it Triple Pie there.  It really isnt my style.  Extremely thick looking.  Looks like a cardboard milk shake and is about as thick as one too.  It has sweet wheatty, hefeweizen-like aromas.  The tase is rich and citrusy and sweet.  Not for me.","Boise, Idaho, USA","pinkzambia"
3263,"2005-04-26",4.6,"Cloudy brown, excellent Abbey Triple.  I cant believe this is an Idaho brew.  Sought it out at the Fairview Flying Pie.  Best Idaho beer Ive tried for sure.","Burley, Idaho, USA","TheReptilian"
3263,"2004-06-02",4.0,"Dark golden brown pour with a generous amount of head. Soft look and feel to this beer. Smells of fruit and citrus. Great look and feel! Nice beer!","Boise, Idaho, USA","DomiNate"
3263,"2004-01-25",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2005 Rerate: This is a nice brew; smooth, prevailent banana/fruit flavors, some citrus qualities; cloudy, quite yeasty and a bit viscous. Sometimes too green and inconsistant in overall quality, but always very good.","Boise, Idaho, USA","ontario102"
3263,"2003-10-12",4.1,"This is a damn fine beer. Pours a very cloudy light brown with some head. Nice aromas with some yeast, clove and some fruit underlying, perhaps a citrus fruit like orange. Flavor was the same as the aromas and nicely balanced. Finished very well and refreshing. If you are ever in Boise, go to Flying Pie Pizzaria and get this! Their pizza is damn good as well.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"
3263,"2003-09-16",4.2,"I eagerly await the day that they start serving this at their brewpub.  This is just too tasty to keep at Flying Pie.  Rather selfish I would say.  The pour is incredible, way too cold, but the pour makes it look like it could have been nitrogen charged, but it was not, just alot of itneresting stuff going on in the glass.  Huge creamy head, with a nice pumpkin pie color in the appearance.  Very interesting flavor that is highly yeasty and doughy, very nutty and rich, also midly complex but not over the top.  I will agree with Buck_Dich, one of the best brewed beers in Boise.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","harlequinn"
3263,"2003-01-29",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2005 Wow, this is one of the best brews that sockeye makes. Well, it poured a nice clouded amber color with thick head and lots of head. Aroma was yeasty with a hint of clove and a touch of alcohol. Flavor was very refined and very fresh. Fairly complex with a subtlty of hops in the finish. This beer drinks very smooth and overall I think one of the best local brewed beers in Boise.

Rerate!: They have this at the brewpub but its much weaker (6.8% ABV) but still has nice fresh flavors and a strong clove presence.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
