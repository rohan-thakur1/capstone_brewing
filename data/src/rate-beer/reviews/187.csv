The pour is a darker ruby/light brown with a lot of translucency and a thick ivory colored head that slowly falls down to a thick collar and film. The aroma is not good. There is a ton of metallic malt and a strong smokiness. A hint of chocolate and a light roast really bring up the back end of this shit show. The flavor is smokey garbage. There is a thin metallic malt and a ton is smoke. Its got a light chocolate happening but its just a mess.

Appereance Dark brown with nice foam (small and average bubbles). Head didnt last too long, it reduced to subtle ring. Nice lacing.
Aroma: flat, a bit sour. Roasty notes: coffee, milk chocolate with a bit of nuts. On third (fourth) plan I feel smoked notes - Im not really sure, if I make me believe I feel... A little bit honey and sweet red fruits.
Taste aroma was subtle, but taste is even more flat.. Watery, with very delicate roasted hints: coffee, chocolate, wood. Smoked notes near limit of perception, very weak. A little bit of caramel and bread. Pretty dispappointing.
Mouthfeel and bitterness: tart and a little sour. High level of taninns intensifies bitterness, making it sharp and long. Body is flat and thin, watery...

187,"2015-06-30",3.9,"From a 65 cl bottle bought at the Stone on Tap event at Amsterdams BeerTemple and picked up there during Carnivale Brettanomyces. Thin, off-white, light yellowish beige head over a hazy deep wine red coloured beer with a slight ochre hue. Aroma of pure, bitter chocolate, black olives, smoked horse meat, dried lemon peel, cigar ashes, iodine, vanilla, soy sauce and bayleaf, acquiring a delicate sweetness when warming up, not unlike milk chocolate, sweet cherry jam and caramel candy; in all, delicate and refined as usual with Stone, and less smokey than expected. Equally delicate flavour profile, clean onset with light spiciness and an oily, lean mouthfeel, rather thin actually for this style, umami flavours (olives), low fruitiness, sourish touch; finish of nice but subtle smokiness (smoked bacon), noble caramel maltiness and peppery and very lightly citrussy hops. The smoke character is very delicately incorporated in this one, allowing other flavours to shine. Great, but the body still could have been thicker for the style.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Palate: smooth, sensibly sippable; medium-bodied, creamy and softly carbonated; a drinkable porter... .Taste: milky, chocolatey, but rather subdued in its profile, almost apologetic in its assertiveness; a malty finish ensures a pleasant, roasted profile...Overall: A smooth, mildly flavorful example of the style--not nearly as prolific as the bottles script proclaims...a welcome but unworthy follow-up to the Founders Breakfast Stout...","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"

Poured from 22 oz bomber into pint glass

Appearance  Pours a deep brown nearly black color with a thick one finger tan head. The head had very nice retention leaving a medium amount of lacing.

Smell  Roasted malt is heaviest in the nose. These are cocoa and dark bread in nature with lighter hints of some smokiness, pine and a nice caramel/brown sugar sweetness.

Taste  A smooth roasted malt and cocoa flavor mixed with a light sweet caramel start the taste out. The caramel fades as some hoppy flavors come to the tongue. These are largely earthy in nature with lighter flavors of pine. At the end, the smoke that is suggested in the name, comes to fruition along with a resurgence (light resurgence) of some sweeter flavors. 
Overall a very nice taste is left on the tongue in the end. 

Mouthfeel  Creamier then the average brew with a slightly lighter level of carbonation. Very nice for the roasty-smoky flavors of the brew.

Overall  Its a rather easy to drink, roasty and a good go to for a slightly dryer porter. Not too shabby.","","Darkmagus82"

Chocolate & dark malts initially with a definite smoked aroma on top that is luckily not as strong as I was expecting. There is some roasted notes and a few hops with some coffee.

Dark brown with a 1cm, bubbly head that is off-white to brown and settles as a nice lacing across the top with some build up around the sides with some nice lacing left on the glass.

Sweet & hoppy malts to begin with some touches of chocolate and a slightly smoked taste. Coffee & a bit of bitterness with some peat and roasted malts following this. A very well balanced beer with a nice combination of sweetness and roasted malts with the smoky character the name suggests with some chocolate at the end and some hops too.

Smooth with a medium body and nice balance to go along with the medium carbonation. A slightly rich tasting beer but one that goes down well.

A nice beer and one that was incredibly easy to drink with a great balance and a nice mix of flavours coming together well and keeping things interesting throughout.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

187,"2012-08-31",3.4,"Aroma: Deep rich earth aroma, Notes of soy sauce and autumn leaves. 

Appearance: Black, deep orange tinges when held to light, tan head.

Taste: Heavy, notes of dark coffee and dark coco, the finish has notes of smoke and char and it is only in this where you note why it is smoked porter.

Palate: Thick almost oily like cold vodka, moderate carbonation and a lasting finish

Overall: I am starting to think stone can do no wrong, I have only had 3 beer by them but they are all fantastic this one would co fantastic with any form of grilled beef or even breakfast meats.","Texas, USA","DANEgerous"
187,"2012-08-25",3.0,"Bottle pour, tan foamy head, nice red/brown hues, very appealing.
Balanced aromas of mild smoked grains, some cherry and tootsie roll.
Was expecting more chocolate, tobacco and coffee. Most porter styles tend to be consistently prominent in those three aromas, but this one was not.
Body was on the thin side, easily drinkable, not much carbonation. Tastes leaned toward sweet, with a bit more hops presence than other porters.
I would have to rate this as a ""light"" porter overall. Certainly a good quality brew, but just lacking the usual brawn of most porters.","Houston, Texas, USA","stephenj007"
187,"2012-08-25",3.6,"Poured into a tulip glass.

A: Pours a very dark burgundy color with good clarity in spite of its darker tint. Particularly, I like that its not as pitch black as some of the other porters Ive had (especially the ones that try to think theyre stouts). The head is a three finger offwhite color with decent retention/lacing.

S: Judging from the smell, this isnt as robust as what Im used to from a porter. Nonetheless, there is plenty of rich dark fruit, chocolate, caramel, molasses, and only a faint touch of smoke.

T: I could kvetch about the smoky flavor not being as expressive as it could be, but as a man who isnt fan of bacon or smoked meats (though I do like my BBQ every once in a while), I like that its only a subtle hint that lingers throughout the drinking experience while never overpowering the porter base. Aside from the smoke, there are subtle hints of chocolate, molasses, dark fruit, and hints of coffee with a faint strike of hops on the finish. While I enjoy this quite a bit, there are some small niggles all around that keep it from being great, chief among which is the lack of robustness I like in a porter. Then again, maybe Im spoiled by Fullers London Porter, but I still think this could use a stronger roast character overall.

M: This has a lighter body at first, but it thickens up near the finish, leaving the tongue rather chalky feeling. The chalky texture detracts from the character slightly. The dryness on the finish builds gradually. Good carbonation.

O: Im not going to whine about this not being robust enough, Im just going to say its a solid porter throughout that never overpowers the tongue with smoke notes. Definitely worth a try. Id get it again - if only because I think its a fantastic pairing with BBQ chicken.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Just as the description says, the smokiness is ""an ELEMENT of the character rather than being THE character,"" and thats what I loved about this beer. Victory Otto for example was way too smokey for me, like drinking a campfire, but this beer had the perfect touch of smoke to compliment the other flavors. 

Medium coffee bitter aroma with a campfire smokey (not overpowering) note. Dark brown/black pour with a big foamy head to film to ring and thick lacing, pretty much everything you could ask in the appearance of a beer. Thick bodied, creamy with a slight fizz feel.

Nice dark roasted aroma with lots of chocolate, and its also quite dark-hoppy. Nice subtle tones of smoked malts and even some hints of cold coffee and sweet caramel. Quite delicious aroma on this one - and it was surprisingly hoppy. Oh yeah, the smoke really comes forward in the flavor. Much more so than in the aroma. Also here lots of good chocolaty tones mixed with dark roasted malts all packed in a medium-bodied, average carbonated body. Lasting almost ashy and roasted finish on this one.

3.5 A: A good bit of carbonation in this one. Black color. Three fingers of frothy/creamy light tan head. Retention is good and sparse irregular lacing is left.

3.5 S: Im a bit disappointed with the amount of smoke in this. I expected something a bit more badass from Stone. Anyway, it still smells good. Chocolate with a moderate neutral malt sweetness. A touch of graininess. Smoke is subdued, but it does add a touch of bacon. If this was 10X stronger, it be damn good.

3.0 T: This is a well crafted brew, but it isnt very exciting. Subtle chocolate, subtle roast, and a subtler smoke. The strongest flavor is neutral malt sweetness.

4.0 M: Despite a medium body, this has a lot of creaminess. Good moderate carbonation. Very nice here.

3.5 D: Stone was one of my first loves, but ever since drinking the beers of hundreds of breweries, they dont seem too impressive anymore. Sometimes I wish I had an undeveloped palate again. In any case, this is a tasty, easy drinker.

187,"2012-02-16",4.1,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/13/2008.  On tap in a stange at Stone Brewery.

Stone Smoked Porter has a dark coffee color and a very small head (wonder what the head looks like out of a bottle) with some delicate lacing. The head leaves a collar that remains over the course of the beer.
Chocolate, coffee, and cigars control the aroma. 3 distinct and abrupt smells, working well together.

Taste: A very strong porter; they definitely dont mess around at Stone Brewery. A smokey oak flavor up front, and it is easy to taste the alcohol. The middle and end are a bomb of malt and hops, with some vanilla and caramel flavorings. The end leaves with a slight smokey chocolate aftertaste residue.

Definitely a full body, but still fairly smooth. There is a definite bite to this porter, like it wants to fight your tongue.

The richness of the porter will definitely impede the speed of consumption, although the fact that it is a thick, chewy, tasty brew more than makes up for that fact.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a kick-ass and kick-your-ass porter.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Touches coffee at 3/4, leading to a grainy, sweet, only rudimentary dry finish. Well-understood, really not bad, but not a typical Porter: Somewhere between a pushed to the limits Franconain Zwickel, a Rauchbier like Aecht Schlenkerla Märzen combined with the sweet and earthy carrot-like remnant of an Black IPA.

187,"2011-05-13",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2011 Bottle. Poured a dark muddy black with dark ruby red highlights beaming around the edges of the glass. It had an average sized (1-2 finger) light brown creamy head that lasted a nice while, leaving a layer of foam floating on top of the brew which resulted some excellent lacing.

The aroma was was bold to say the least. It had a strong scent of roasted caramel malts, a leathery yeast with a subtle smokey odor and had notes of  dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and a touch of raisons.

It tasted wonderfully lightly bitter-sweet with nice notes of dark chocolate, caramel and dried fruit in the beginning then became a tad more on the bitter coffee side and had a mild smokey finish that was left lingering on the palate for a really nice long time.

Mouthfeel was medium to full in body (I am leaning more towards full) and smooth and creamy in texture with a nice light soft carbonation.

Overall this was an awesome brew. I am always a little leary about smoked beers but the flavors in this one melded so well together that it left me wanting more.","Macon, North Carolina, USA","KajII"

A dark brown beer with smokey scent so strong it puts one in mind of a German Rauchbier rather than a Porter, Also hints of vanilla and coffee. The taste is more akin to a porter, though the smoke is pervasive through to the long finish of burnt malt and chocolate. The smoke certainly doesnt overpower in the taste and adds an enjoyable element to what is already an excellent beer style.","NORTHERN IRELAND","Beersiveknown"
187,"2011-05-07",2.7,"You gotta be careful with smoked malts-- its very easy to overload them into a brew and end up with beer that tastes like its being served in an ashtray.  Stone Smoked Porter eases back the throttle on the burnt roastiness, presenting a good porter that just so happens to also give off a bongwater finish.  Look, Im trying to be objective, but smoked beers have yet to rub my rhubarb the right way.  Stones Smoked Porter serves as the best example of the style Ive come across, but I still dont like it very much.  The smokiness only grows as the beer warms, and eventually the beer turns my burps into charcoal briquettes.  (2008)","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

It pours a nice dark brown with some reddish hues, the head is thick and foamy. The head is slightly tan. It holds for a bit then recedes to some pretty nice lacing.

It smells like an IPA with some brown sugar thrown in, Stone loves their hops huh. There is a hint of roastiness but much less than expected.

The flavor isnt hoppy bitter, but it has a considerable amount of hop flavor. There is also a hint of smokiness and some caramel sweetness.

187,"2011-03-03",4.3,"Appearance:
Pours jet black. Dark Ruby Red color when held to the light with a 1 1/2 to 2 finger tan bubbly head 

Smell:
First nose dip brang heavy chocolate maltiness with a touch of espresso and brown sugar. smelled a littl grapefruit rine from the hops. After giving it a little swirl the heavier smoke smells and a bourbon like booziness become apparent.

Taste:
Hard Smoke like im enjoying a cuban.... cigar. It hits on the outside of the tongue with a nice silky layer of decedent chocolate sifting over the middle of my tongue. Just an ever so slight hint of caramel pops out here and there. it sits and waits in the background till you ahve wore out the smoke and chocolate.

Mouthfeel:
creamy on the top of the tongue, hard on the sides with the smoke edginess. leaves a very slight stickiness on the upper lip.

Drinkability:
I want some blackened chicken and roasted corn, perhaps texas style BBQ. Char some meat a little bit and drink this with it. mmmm. I remember having some cheesess with Ash rind. I think those would be deligtful with this. I could drink this with that food or on its own.

A overarching hazy sweetness in the nose. Some sweet apples, mixed fruit with toffee and cereal malts. Smoked woody grain in there, but very much in the background along with light mocha, earth and light pine. These notes sort of blend together though a bit and dont stand individually as maybe they could have. The flavor notes act in a similar way. The balance is fine, but again the flavors dont pop as much as they could for a heavier feeling 6% abv. Soft carbonation here as well, with a lack of smooth creaminess.

Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Goes down very smooth.

Drinkability: High drinkability. You could knock back more than one bomber over the course of an evening. This is a great choice for a cold day.

Overall: Excellent beer overall. This is one of the best porters Ive ever had. I would definitely recommend trying this. Once again, Stone does not disappoint.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"

Nice tan, creamy head with very nice retention and excellent lacing.  The head settled to a wonderful film on top.  The description on the bottle is spot on.  A nice smokey aroma of coffee and chocolate.  Licorice is both delicate and birlliant.  The dark fruit is subdued, but makes a worthy impression.  The smell is very well balanced in my opinion.  A nice robust black coffee flavor jumps out at first.  Followed by some rich chocolate flavors.  Both flavors are equally roasty, burnt and smokey.  The dark fruit, like in the taste, is pushed to the backgorund to give a little complexity.  Medium to mostly full mouthfeel.  Chewy and smooth.  Tons left on the palate waiting for the next sip.  Very dry and exquisite.  This is a Porter that has a strong character and flavor.  Its perfect for the bitter cold evenings.  The smokey aroma and flavor are really prominent and, to some extent, started to distract me.  Not a great deal, but some.  Its still a great, well rounded Porter.

A nice dark brown (or very deep mahogany) colour to it. The head is very foamy at first, then it settles down to about a finger in thickness. Very nice lacing and good head retention. Looks beautfiyl.

The smell is not that intense (probably because the beer isnt that fresh). Roasted malts, bitter chocolate, a tint of coffee. Some earthy hops and a fair amount of smoke.

The taste had a wonderful roasted and smoked profile. Pretty sweet for a porter, but the sweetness is not pushing the limits. Some earthy hops. The smoke adds an extra layer of meatiness to the beer. The after-taste is full of roasted malt and chocolate notes; the bitterness is not too strong. Very balanced and flavourful. I like how the bitterness, which is pretty intense, is suppressed by the sweetness and the smokiness.

Medium-to-full-bodied. Quite thick, but very smooth, even creamy. Not much carbonation. A slight slight warming sensation from the alcohol. Moderately dry and bitter.

Nice peat smokiness up front in the nose, and it segues right into the taste. Malts show in a little later; a nice coffee roast thats still wedged in behind the smoke. Some malt stickiness starts to build on my lip. Taste is nice and rich, but it makes clear the alcohol is no stronger than any mass beer. Nice to sit with at the end of the day, with some sausage or an ice cream dessert. I tried it with a PB&J as suggested on the bottle.

Its a big, flavorful porter that pours a rich, dark brown color and supports a nice-sized, coffee-cream head. Rich chocolate sweetness predominates in the nose, but it lacks the complexity of a bigger beer. Im not being very forgiving here, but I was hoping for more smoke and more interest from this entry in Stones lineup. Smoke is disappointingly weak in the flavor profile.

187,"2010-05-25",4.0,"Bomber poured into a pint glass had a solid tan head that dissipated slowly leaving some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is roasted and chocolate malt, as is the flavor. There is a little bit of smokiness in both, but I can definitely understand the complaint that for a ""smoked"" porter, the smokiness is not very pronounced. Its plenty for me, though. The color is basically coke; its pretty much black, but if you hold it up to a light you can kinda-sorta see that its brown. Sort of.

The more I sit here and drink, the more the sweetnees and the smokiness are coming out. Theres also a nice, lingering bitterness on the backend (the beers, not mine). I tend to like my pale ales on the dry side and my porters and stouts a little sweeter. This is definitely on the dry side for me.

The smokiness comes out quite a bit more in the flavor.  Rich and velvety with roast coffee and dark chocolate coming through in the rear.  Almost a roasted hazelnut quality as well.

187,"2010-04-10",3.6,"Bomber shared with my brother in law. I picked this up on the day that Stone started releasing their brews in Chicago. This beer poured a dark brown color with mahogany tints around the edges. It also had a one finger width brown frothy head. The aroma was pretty bland for a smoked porter. I only caught a little bit of smoke, some roasted malt, and possibly some light coffee and cocoa. The taste was also not as robust as I thought it would be. It had a hint of smoke, a lot of roasted malt, and a bit of coffee... fairly standard for a porter. It had a medium bodied mouth feel and was very easy to drink. Overall a very good beer by Stone. I wish it had more smoke character in it though...","Streator, Illinois, USA","General66"
187,"2010-04-10",3.9,"Dark brown color with red hues, a healthy light brown head, and strong lacing.  Aroma of heavily smoked malt.  Go peat!  Palate is smooth, very clean and balanced for the smoke presence - which, by the way, is out of this world.  Closely comparable to a real rauchbier.  Smoke aside, this is a great porter with your standard coffee and chocolate qualities.  Great body and hefty smoke without being uncomfortably or annoyingly smoky like some smoked beers can get.  Exceptional.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

The body is a very dark deep red thats almost black with a 1 finger thick cream head. On first sip I got a lot of smoke and roasted malt. As I drank more and the beer warmed I got a lot more bitter coffee, roasted malt, and of course the smoke flavor.

Color is a deep ruby, almost black, with a inch thick, creamy, espresso-colored head that quickly subsides to a fine layer which laces thinly down the glass. I dont know what Koch is talking about because the peat malt is unquestionably the defining character of this beer. Still, its not overwhelming so you can still enjoy the bittersweet chocolate malt behind it. The texture could be a bit thicker but the beer still manages to be rather creamy and soft.

I liked this porter, but it might not be my prefered type of porter - perhaps the Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is better for me, or I need a desert to go with this Stone Smoke one.","Maryland, USA","jcos"

187,"2009-12-01",3.7,"Hmmm, perhaps the first Stone beer that hasnt blown me away instantly. I mean yes its a good beer, but unfortunately nothing ground breaking. Although I will say I think its probably a little on the cool side, so I will wait for it to warm up a little, and then may re-rate. But for now: Looks pretty good in the glass, I think my 3 seems harsh, but I know how appetizing Stone beers can look, and this is about average for them Id say, so it rest on a 3 for that reason. Deep brown/red around the edges with very dark brown/black center, small creamy looking tan head. It has a lovely aroma but its a tad subdued. Theres vanilla, cream, wood chips, milk chocolate, mocha on the nose and a sort of earthy dustiness. Flavour is complex but quite subtle, which in a way is quite nice as it proves that Stone arent just about big expressions, though thats what I love them for. Lots of earthy smokiness, like ash or oak smoke, very tasty. This is definitely a beer that grows as it warms. There more vanilla and cream with more bitter notes like coffee and dark chocolate and then some quite fruity background flavours alo the lines of dark sultanas or prunes. Finish is very well balanced with a touch of sweetness but a definite bitter edge. Doesnt dry the palate out too much although the initial flavour is quite dry, but somehow through the mids into the finish a sweeter syrupy texture takes hold to balance everything out. All in all a very good beer that has everything I want but for some odd reason, just misses truly exciting me. I think on closer inspection the downfall maybe the texture/conditioning/carbonation. The beer could perhaps be creamier, theres a almost too present ""fizzy"" quality as it washes over my tongue... Look dont get me wrong its a great beer, but Im marking on a very high level here and for Stone this is what I would call a flag ship bench mark style of beer.","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"

187,"2009-11-21",3.7,"pours out clear black with a thin partially bubbly grayish beige head that settled rather fast.  the body is pretty black with no light penetration and no bubbles rising up that i can see.  the aromas are bitter chocolate with hints of smoke and dark roasted coffee beans.  i also smell peat, grass, malts, and some sugar with no real hoppy smell, but is still bitter to the nose.  it is medium bodied and finishes pretty dry.  i taste some smokey wood, coffee, chocolate and milk.  the carbonation is pretty smooth but still a little to much for the tongue for this style of beer.  the aftertaste is nicely sweet and sticks around very nicely for a little while and leaves a watery feeling on the tip of the tongue.  very enjoyable and this beer could be paired with a whole range of culinary dishes very well.","burlington, New Jersey, USA","kwerikson"

Quite good.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","rags2rags"
187,"2009-11-18",4.6,"Dark, dark ruby color. Appears black at first. Nice easy pour produces a frickin huge head of dense tan foam, which has hellish retention. Will it ever go away? Wow. Impressive for sure, but almost too much. Lacing is nice and sticky.

Big chocolatey malts. A touch of smoke. Light hint of some hop spiciness. Hints of caramel and dark fruits. Big earthiness quality.
A fairly complex nose.

Big flavor of roasted malt. Underlying hint of smokiness, not nearly as much as I expected. Sweetness of vanilla and caramel. Nice earthy quality here, also. Very slight hops bite. Light chocolate and coffee notes. Hints of dark fruits.

Good solid medium boby. Good level of creaminess. 

This is an excellent porter, overall. I would drink many of these, and often, if given the opportunity.
Not as smoky as may have been expected, but a very good offering from Stone, nonetheless.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","coldmeat23"

187,"2009-11-09",3.6,"Enjoyed on tap in a pub glass.  The beer pours a very deep dark brown with a large and long-lasting tan head.  The subtle notes of the smoke in the aroma is initially very surprising, especially given the fact that I was expecting something closer to German rauchbiers.  Instead, there is a hint of smoke, while the quintessential roasted notes of roasted barley and chocolate malts come through.  The palate is full in flavor, very slightly smokey, and roasty without tasting like ash or charcoal.  High crystal malts, more roasted barley, and some milk to slightly dark chocolate.  The finish is nicely sweet, which helps to restrained the roasted flavors.  Overall, nicely crafted.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Appearance: Black with slight ruby highlights and a huge, creamy, light tan head.  Great head retention and great lacing.
Aroma: Pine hops, light caramel, soap, and a bit of smoke.  A much lighter nose than I was expecting.
Flavor: Bitter pine hops, licorice, and light fruit notes. A bit of chocolate emerges as the beer warms.  Kind of anticlimactic.  Good, but not great.
Palate: Medium-high carbonation with a medium-rich mouthfeel and a long bitter finish.

Right from the get go the smoked presence lifts to the nostrils followed by a pleasant chocolately coffee bean facade. This brew pours an opaque black that one friend said ""looks like molasses,"" with a delicate, stout-like dark brown head. While Stone prides the Element part of the smoked malt, I would prefer a bit heavier smoked presence, after all it is a smoked porter. The body is the only region where this beer struggles, as it seems to carry a bit too much water, undoubtedly unusual for a Stone.

187,"2009-06-20",3.9,"The first thing that hits you as you open is that trademark Stone hoppiness, wow! Im not a big hophead so was a little apprehensive. Pours a very nice, deep brown with creamy head. Quite appealing.

The smokiness was not apparent at first, but as I sipped the hoppiness gave way to a subtle smoke. Im not a porter aficionado so I have nothing for comparison. This seems spot on for my tastes though. Not overpowering, very balanced.

Tasty roasted malt ending with an almost inconspicuous smokiness. Hops still present but as an ""also-ran"" that doesnt intrude. Slightly sweet and simple. Flows a bit thinner over the tongue than I thought. I expected a bit more density, but again Im not porter savvy.

5.9% makes this a winner for drinkability and would go extremely well at a backyard barbecue. Would make an excellent gateway for those that think craft beer is only about extremes. A pleasure.","Tennessee, USA","Brianito"

187,"2009-05-12",4.1,"22oz bottle. Pours a very dark brown, almost black body with some red tints around the edges. Thick and foamy, two-finger width, light brown colored head that dissipates slowly and leaves a lot of nice layered lacing. Solid aroma with lots of sweet brown malts and a nice fruity, soft roasty smell. Smokey, but more like a honey ham smoke than straight up smoked ham. It definitely accompanies the rest of the beer. Some sweet chocolates and licorice with just a splash of coffee. Flavor is very similar. Sweet malts and dry backing of roast and smoke. Initially a lot of sweet caramels and fruity malts with a slow developing hop bitterness. Some chocolates come in as well as more dark fruits before the smoke and roast come in to completely dry this sucka out. Not a big aftertaste, but a solid echo of chocolate, caramel, and smoke. Palate is soft, very balanced, and medium bodied. Overall, a damn good beer. Solid all around. Not a very intense hoppy/roasty porter, but I love when smoked beers have balance like this and the smoke accompanies the flavors rather than dominating them.

Dark sweet malts are the primary aroma to this beer. Theres a chaulkiness to the smell. Any hop takes a back seat to the chocolate malt. Surprisingly, there is little smokiness to the aroma. 

First impression is the fullness of the body--more than would normally be expected. Chocolate malt is the predominant flavoring. That said, there is a soft hop balance that lingers in the aftertaste. The ""smoke"" appears in the swallow, briefly. 

This is another complex and interesting beer from Stone. I dont rank it as high as some of their other beers, but it is certainly superior to many of the available porters.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","smcolw"

Do your move, bust your style, raver dance rapid
Gidabiddy hiddabiddy gidabiddy beat on the flow thats so savage
Uncle TC and Mr. Jakes, that spells damage
We run things from here to trinity, oh, we damn flashy
Over breakbeat, SK, salsa or tough garage
Hip-hop, even if youre stiff dead in a carriage
True to the dead one that left with a ratchet
Wrap your head around this stuff, kid, you cant nap it
Its the rough-rugged, ever-ready raw-core classic",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"

Once the beer enters the mouth a harmonious blend of chocolate, coffee, sweet toffee, figs, and smoke. I was expecting a smokier beer such as alaskan but was very impressed by the balance achieved in this beer.

187,"2009-03-24",3.8,"As I pour most of the contents of my 220oz bomber into my awaiting glass, a deep earthen black-brown body greets my eyes while a soft tan head crowns and then fades into a thin film. Sticky lace mark her trail while a bouquet of smoke and wood waits for no one, rushing out to invite me in for a much closer encounter. Faint licorice, dates, chocolate and light notes of bitter espresso mingle amidst the smoke and wood. Mouth watering, I savor our first of many quaffs together which are surprisingly clean with a medium-bodied airiness. Wood and smoke pervades every beery pore, while subtle notes of soft milk chocolate, licorice, cream, and raisins keep her true to her porter roots. Faint bitter hops nips at her pleasantly dry finish. Each quaff is a rich bouquet of delicate smoked wood with nibs of chocolate, cream, and dark fruits passing through. Thankfully the smoke is not overwhelming, which would only serve to smother the beer and my palate. Instead, my Stone Smoked Porter has achieved a perfect balance of smoke and beer, in this case a porter. As she warms, more soft chocolate and coffee notes mingle amicably with the smoke and wood when suddenly, without warning, I find my glass empty.


A 22oz bottle of Smoked Porter sounds like a lot, but instead she is just the right amount. I could and did easily enjoy every single quaff of her smoky porter depths. Im not sure how long she would age before the freshness of the smoke would start to subside, but maybe someday Ill experiment and find out. In the meantime, I am going to enjoy as much fresh Stone Smoked Porter as I can possible fit in my fridge.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

187,"2009-03-18",3.4,"Eye-wateringly expensive bottle at The Penguins Arms. Handsome jet pour collared with beige, collapsing to a marbled slick in swigs. Nose notably soft and lactic; mellow in the hop department with soap and blackcurrant but mostly milk chocolate, walnut, vegetal locust bean notes, alcohol, prune at a push. Caramel and soft casky tones in there. Sweet and lactic like a Belgian dubbel, but not especially porter-like and certainly not smoked or even roasty. A typical English mild of half the strength is charred to a cinder compared to this. Thick black milk with barely a tickle of fizz, luxurious creaminess; soapy alkaline licks. Slippery, heavy and a bit tiring after half a bottle, Considerably less hop and malt excitement than I was expecting. Chocolate, milky coffee, caramel and oak creaminess; wood, slate and boredom.

187,"2008-12-01",3.3,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2008 This porter has a plain look to it. It does not look bad. I love the black opaque color, but the head is an off-white. I am not ragging on it, but a porter with such high praise should have a better looking head. Anyways, there is a nice rich smoke, and coffee aroma. This porter is pungent. I dont have to stick my nose in the beer just to catch a whiff. There might also be some leather in there to accompany the smoke taste. Pretty good aroma. Wow, what a great complex taste. There is  a lovely roast aftertaste that hits the back of my throat. This is strange I have never had this type of roast flavor last this long. Generally, the bitter takes over, but with this the smoke just lasts. Nice taste of wood and coffee, as well. A little watery, if you ask me. I think it could be a bit smoother and thicker. Overall, a nice porter, but it is surely not the best I have tried. I think what saves this is the lasting roast flavor. I think this is like a nice looking car that is actually not as good as its hype. I would recommend trying it, but only to try.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

The smell is of smoke and semi-sweet chocolate.

The first taste to hit the tongue is the smokiness followed immediately by the nicely roasted malt. A hint of dark chocolate can be tasted as well. The finish is a very roasted flavor with a hint of charcoal. An excellent blend in the finish.

The carbonation is done very well and complements the brew’s viscocity.

A fine tasting brew that all could drink all night. Extremely drinkable and proves to be yet another astounding offering from Stone.

For my taste buds, it obscured the more porter-like elements (which were all there--lactose, smoke, peat, chocolate, malt), and I didn’t think this was smoked enough to merit the ""Smoked Porter"" label, even if they don’t claim it to be a rauchbier.  All that said, it was a very enjoyable brew; just needed some expectation management.

187,"2008-05-18",4.1,"Picked this up in for Vermont of all places in the bomber. Poured into a pint glass dark as night with a really nice head. The lacing from the head was amazing as it stuck to the sides. It smelled of smokey chocolate malts but the aroma really didnt blew down any doors. The taste however did. It was balanced and complete. Nearly all porters in my book lack somewhere: When the flavor is on the body is too light, when the body is nice and creamy the flavor is watery. To this point I can say this is probably the best porter I have had and it reinstalled my faith in porters.","Bridgeport, Connecticut, USA","Bungalo22"
187,"2008-05-12",3.7,"A bit overated in my opinion. I must say, I agree with Greg Kochs quote, the smoke level is perfect. Pours with a leage, foamy, ligh brown head covering an ultra dark brown body. Aroma is smoke and tons of molasses. Taste is smokeyness, and coffee. Tons of intense flavor for a sub-6% ABV. Sort of a nutty aftertaste. Great lacing from the head. Light carbonation and a decent mouthfeel.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

Vanilla, caramel, coffee, and maybe licorice (?) in the aroma. Full bodied mouthfeel, roasty malt character, chocolate, medium sweetness, smokiness, and just a bit of hop on the backend. This was a fantastic brew, and replaces Anchor as my favorite porter.","New Hampshire, USA","tylerss20"

Pours dark brown, almost black and opaque.
Mahogany edging with a crimson hue.
A humble half-inch head of beige retreated quickly to a partial coverage skim coat and a few dots of lacework.

Aromatics are surprisingly vineous. Bitter chocolate, red wine, scorched caramel bits, some dark fruit, and a smidge of smoldering embers. A hint of vanilla rounds out the bunch.

Thin mouthfeel. Slightly creamy with low carbonation.

Dark chocolate, deep roasted malts, espresso grounds and mild smoke on the pallet.
All are quite balanced and the overall character is subdued and sessionesque.
Finishes with some lingering caramel drizzeled dark malts.

Smells hopped up and inviting however it doesnt nearly smell like i would expect for how dark it looks. Although the smell was mild, the taste is smoky and reminescant of burnt hops. Very tasty. It has a fairly thick mouthfeel and seems to be carbonated just the right amount, enough to give it a good consictency but not be distracting. It is a pleasure to drink but since it is dark the drinkability suffers a bit, easy to drink one glass but after that it gets harder.","California, USA","Lothore"

Poured a deep, deep brown, almost black, letting almost no light in. Head was creamy and left a nice smooth thick lace. The nose hits home with a start of minty hops and roasted coffee beans. It then leads into cocoa and milk chocolate with a dark fruit component, and the smoke just barley makes an appearance. This is a very roast-forward porter upfront in the mouth. The roast is accompanied by a dark chocolate and sweet plums. Following towards the finish are bitter espresso notes with a very fresh hop profile. Quite bitter with a nice minty, sweet aftertaste. Interesting there is very little smoke here. This is a very creamy, drinkable porter, and at 5.9%, I could drink a lot of this. Thanks Dawn, for giving me the opportunity to try this.

The nose is truly interesting. On the pour, I am hit by an aroma that reminds me of a peanut butter and banana sandwich (emphasis on the fruit). As the head diminishes, the peanut butter transitions into more of a cocoa note with a touch of fruity hops in the background. Medium-bodied and slick, with a smoky, roasted and lightly bitter finish. Thr flavor features a lot more roasted character than the nose would indicate. The flavor runs from dark roast, caramel and chocolate malt to a hard wood smokiness and fruity hops at the conclusion. This is a tasty and very drinkable porter with a subtle smokiness that supports, rather than dominates, the flavor. I would bet this pairs well with all kinds of foods.

The initial flavour is mildly chocolaty with hints of wood, and a bit of vanilla and brown sugar. The brew passing causes me to think, ""watery,"" as it has that similar feeling in your mouth when you drink unfiltered tap water. Hm, thats not exactly a quality that I like.

Courtesy of my Summer Secret Santa. Thank you. 22oz bomber. Dark brown, very nearly black pour. 2 finger thick, creamy looking dark khaki colored head. Pretty densely packed with only a smattering of bubbles on top of a mountain of foam. Mostly lasting, leaves a thick layer of foam once the head dies down a bit. Impressive coating sheet lacing. Nose of rich dark chocolate, coffee/espresso, peat malts, dark fruits and molasses. The little touch of smoke makes this one really stand out among other Porters Ive had. This smells really good. Peat, molasses, chocolate, coffee, dark fruits and charred roasted smoky malts make up the flavor profile. There is a bitterness present as well, just in the background, playing tricks on your mind. Medium bodied, fairly substantial, creamy mouthfeel. Coating on the tongue. Finish is lengthy, bitter and smoky, with a nice kick of roasted malts and chocolate to finish things out.

Thankfully flavor was. A rich dark malt flavor with chocolate, raisin, anise, biscotti, vanilla, cherry, the list goes on. The roastiness comes out as it warms but is never overdone or overly smoky. There is a hint of cough syrup and a touch of tartness underpinning the black malt roastiness. Full bodied but not extremely filling. 5.9% deceived me. Very complex beer gains points in the overall category. Very good.","Virginia, USA","Hazmatt"

Taste is rich, sweet and smoky.  Starting with a full medium body that goes down with a rich feel coming on.  Finish is a sweet rich roasted malt flavor backed by a light smokiness.  On the very end is a sharp feel.  Its not as good as Sugardaddy was but is still a nice porter.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"

Following Stones advice I prepared a pb&j and cracked my bomber open. I ended up enjoying the sandwich more...

Im a big fan of Stone but this was just awful. SSP had a rusted metal, olive scent. Taste was of smoked rotten olives and beef. There wasnt an ounce of chocolate, vanilla or anything enjoyable in there. Mouth feel was okay but rather thin. When I started on the sandwich it  brought out the alcohol flavor and made things worse. 
Maybe this bottle was bad? Maybe I havent developed a taste for smoked brews? Either way, this is one of the few bombers Ive had to give away, and even then, it went unfinished.","Massachusetts, USA","alandudeman"

Aroma is that of a robust porter - roasty with coffee and chocolate notes, with some soft floral dry hops; the smoke element is muted.  Likewise the flavor is dominated by burnt malts which along with the subtle smoke gives it a nice charred wood/campfire character.  Mouthfeel was medium to medium-light and carbonation was moderately low.  I thought this was a pretty solid, well-balanced robust porter, though not terribly exciting.

Flavours are again, weak for a porter, roasty malts, with sweet chocolate, and a vanilla finish, like a few others, I was hard pressed to find any hint of smokey flavour. The palate was a touch watery, but not bad. The beer was smooth, so it went well with a meal, and the flavours were light but complex so it was good to eat dinner with.

Suggestions of oranges and pine sap on the nose.  Direct hoppiness.  Astringent French roast, slightly sour, eases its way in beside a thick mash of wild rice and maple syrup.  Silky smoke and milk chocolate taste.  Sweetness is prevalent for the most part as a calm vanilla tobacco, which has a bit of citrus sparkle to it.  Black coffee with a lot of sweetening.  Theres a breath of smoky evergreen bitterness before a thoroughly residual coke  sugar finish.  Reasonably heavy presence in the mouth, but lacks the velvet texture to contextualize it.

Smokey aromas were somewhat muted and tame. Notes of charred oak, chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts and vanilla come through. Mouthfeel was moderately light and fluffy with a mild carbonation. Taste profile was a bit more assertive than the aromas revealing more of the charred wood and smoke characteristics expected. A nice balance noted between the smokey tones and the chocolate/coffee flavors from the dark roasted malts along with just a touch of hops. Finish seemed a touch astringent for a brief second or two, but if youre in the mood for a smoked dark ale this is a solid choice.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

Moderate cafe au lait head with good retention and a fairly lively body (which I prefer in a porter, as some can be a bit leaden and dull). As always with smoked porters, this one succeeds by being a wonderful porter first and foremost. Nicely deep chocolate flavor, with prominent barley roasts and heavy peat.

I will immediately skip to the overall because overall this is a nice porter and I got a lot of enjoyment out of it. Aroma is medium to mild with scents of chocolate and roasted goodness, its just too mild to be given a higher score. Great pour one of the best Ive seen from a porter. Rich and dark this is a looker good swirling tan head and loads of tacky lacing. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth but lacks a thick creaminess I like to find in a good porter, it does get better as it warms but still doesnt hit the right level. Flavor is real nice. I can smell a bit of the smoked flavor as I drink, my taste buds first pick up on some chocolate and caramel followed with a bitter coffee taste. The smokiness is mild and it hits the back of the throat on the way down leading to a great exhale.

Opaque brown/black color with a tan head that was vigorous, but wasted away leaving delicate lace. Medium mouthfeel that thickens as the mild carbonation departs. Scotch smoke start, some dark roasted malt, a touch of sour, some floral hop? A smidgeon of baking chocolate. Its smooth, but the smoke adds a rough touch to the palate. The finish is not quite dry, but not like a sweet stout either. In the end the mouth puckers a bit, and it is still not absolutely dry. The flavors go on and on. I vote for some bitter in the end.

The flavor boasts bakers chocolate, roasty malt, a light light smoke, and some general sweetness. The palate is full and smooth, but not very viscous.

Initially has a large tan head that fades to a darkish tan froth. Aroma is less than expected for a smoked brew. It does have some mild roastyness about it but I dont think it can be called smoked. Hints of hickory smoking. Nice lacing on this stuff. It has some medium bitterness in the back of the throat after you get to know it. That bitterness builds as the drinks continue. Decent,  just slightly bellow medium carboatiion. That back of your throat bitterness continues to build with each taste.

Appearance: Black with a very full and very lingering head. If looks could kill, this beer would be on death row right about now.

smell: Chocolate first and foremost. There is also just the slightest hint of smoke to be found.

taste: Again Im getting chocolate above anything else, but the coffee undertones are still there in force and the smoky aspect.... not too strong not too faint, just about perfect.

Mouthfeel: Very creamy and the smoke seems to be more noticeable than in the taste alone or the smell. Still not overpowering by any means, but more assertive and ready to scare off all those ""yellow fizzy"" beer drinkers.

drinkability: Could see myself very easily having a couple bombers back to back of this majestic brew. Can only speak for myself, but it lives up to any hype its been given and then some.","USA","joeyhotrod"

187,"2007-03-04",4.0,"22oz. Bomber

Opened with a pfffttt...Poured in my pint glass a viscous black. Very dark. Some dark ruby tinting when held up to the light. A half inch tan head sits on top but fades fairly quickly to an even top coat. Lacing sticks as my glass is tilted but slowly slides back into the abyss that is the body of this beer.

The smell is filled with roasted malt goodness. Along with chocolate and a tiny bit of burnt grain. There is just a slight touch of smoke up front but to tell you the truth I dont think Id be able to pick it up if I didnt know it was there. As it warms I can pick up the smoke more and more.

The taste is very close to perfect. Starts with a small burnt grain taste quickly taken over by the roasted malts and chocolate. I cant really taste the hops but theyre in there. There is a nice bitterness from what tastes like a combonation of hops and darkly roasted malt. The smokiness is there faintly in the back throughout the drink. Very nicely done and balanced.

Mouthfeel is viscous but you could tell this from the pour. Its thick in my mouth but not coyingly so. Silky smooth but somehow a little chewy/gritty. I know that doesnt sound right but thats how it is. I really like the feel especially on a cold night like tonight.

For a smoked porter the drinkability is outstanding. The lower alcohol helps as to not be too big of a beer to drink a lot of.

Palate is mid-bodied and smooth without being oppressive (for a seemingly ""heavy"" beer), and the tongue finds a delicate lift of effervescence. Chocolate makes for a sweet base flavor while a bitter roastiness makes for a ""serious"" finish. A bit unrefined, but malts and hops conjoin here in a blissful union.

The taste slams you with darkly roasted malt, burnt coffee, a bit of chocolate, and a bit of smoke. Nothing sweet at all in the flavor. Full bodied, medium carbonation. Some hop bitterness at the end. Ah, there’s plenty of smoke in the lingering aftertaste.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"

187,"2007-01-15",4.8,"At first glance, this beer is the solid black of the monolith.  When held to the light, it yields a very intense, low-frequency red of an LED.  The head is thick, lumpy, and tan.  The aroma is that of roasted coffee, a hint of smoke, and possibly spuce and licorice.  I cant help but notice the cementish smell of the yeast.  It is instantly recognizable as a California beer.  The flavor is very pulled-together.  The smoke flavor does not at all overwhelm.  The bitterness is appropriately prominent with a grapefruitish flavor.  Perhaps this is from Cascades?  Again, very California.  It seems to be around 35 IBU.  The citrus bitterness melds seamlessly with that of dark coffee and dark chocolate.  It avoids being astringent and the smoke flavor merely lurks in the background.  If anything, it serves to enhance the overall roasted flavor.  It is medium-bodied and very drinkable.  This could serve as a session beer.  The carbonation is lively and seems to bring out the flavor of the hops.  Neither the roasted flavor nor the grapefruit rind flavor muddle each other and work together brilliantly.  Again: a very pulled-together flavor.  The aftertaste is short and has the bitterness of french roast coffee and bitter chocolate.  I love it.","Fairport, New York, USA","yesyouam"

187,"2007-01-11",4.1,"Stone makes some awesome beers and the Smoked Porter is among my favorites.  Like the quote from Koch above the smokiness is understated relative to other ""smoked"" beers but it complements the finish nicely.  This porter is maltier and not so dry as other porters that Ive had.  The aroma is very malty as well.  The instant you inhale if youre thinking ""malted milk balls"" you wont be wrong.  As you inhale further you pick up fruity highlights.  The flavor is robust and full bodied and the finish is long.  Perhaps a bit fizzy out of the bottle.  I can see this being a really nice beer on nitro.","USA","aharbick"

Flavor is rich and chocolatey with little hop bitterness and a subtle, yet pleasurably perceptible smokiness that contributes to the balance of the sweet malts.  The smoke is not overpowering as it is in most beers with ""Smoked"" in the name.  The mouthfeel is silky smooth and refreshing for a porter.  Overall a great beer to drink with a meal that it wont overpower (like light fish or something like that).  Excellent.","Bloomfield, New Jersey, USA","dogfishho"

Regardless of their approach, I think a bit more peat smoke would add to the character and not overwhelm it.  Maybe being a scotch drinker has dulled my peat-detectors. Anyway, nice looking, head, lacing, etc but just didnt excite me.

There is certianly some chocolate and burnt aromas when I stuff my nose into the glass and its all followed by a hint of smoked meatyness. I agree with Greg Koch, the smoke is an element, not the beer. The first sip isnt really of porter. Rather its sweet with some coffee flavours and a bit of chocolate, hints of burnt malts and that meaty smoke flavour again comes in and doesnt take over per se, but it commands attention from your palate.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"

It was getting late as we cracked this one.Poured a deepest ruby brown, quite bright, sparkling in the lights but with no visible carbonation. Head rose, fell, did not last long, given the film on my glass at this stage I was not surprised. Sweetish, leathery, tar and marmite nose with a feint whiff of next day bonfire. First mouthful establishes some very dusty chocolate malts. From the next a sharp, resinous and acridly grassy twang spreads across the palate tainting what could be a decent beer. A good edge of rough pasty dark malts counteract bringing it back in the aftertaste. Smoke begins to linger also somehow balancing it out and making it pleasant despite the raspy sharp edge. Excellent length and a lovely smoothness adds points. The body itself not big, but it atleast holds ground. This wasnt too bad a drop, just nothing special to merit a high score. Sessionable, I suppose. (1 pint, 6 Fl.Oz, age unknown)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Roasted, smoky malts in the aroma, along with some subdued chocolate. The flavour is similar to this, and the smoke is something that provides backbone rather than being dominant in any way. Not really what I was expecting. Its subtle and blends nicely with the chocolate and coffee flavours, but you really have to look for it. I was expecting the smokiness to be much more pronounced - maybe not right in the front, like a rauchbier, but this was quite deep in the background. Theres a clean, lightly bitter finish to this and all-in-all, its a very fine porter, very smooth and easy drinking, even if I was expecting something much heartier, smokier, and robust...especially as this was coming from Stone, typically a brewer of such big, ""look at me"" beers.

Aroma of caramel and chocolate malts up front, then some coffee roastiness and a little smoky peat.  I was wondering why this beer was in the porter category and not in the smoked (even though I read the description), but it really isnt that strong.  As soon as I said that, the taste had a fair amount more smoke--not too much, mind you.  Not as sweet as you would imagine from the aroma, either.

Flavor was similar, with a more interesting smoke character that appears both in the taste and the finish.  The smoke dries out the finish which is very well balanced, compared to Ruination (which I had before I started actually writing reviews).

Translucent black (is that an oxymoron?) with a tan head. The aroma is vinous with some chocolate and a slight hint of smoke. This one provides a well-balanced flavor, dark malts blending with raisins and a subtle peach sweetness while the smoke whispers around the edges adding wood-and-tobacco accents.

The smoked malts are far in the background, but that I think that is good. Finish is well balanced and the palate is appropriately medium bodied.

187,"2006-05-27",3.6,"22oz bomber. Mistakenly grabbed this instead of the Imperial Stout at the store, as the shelf-stockers, in their infinite wisdom, put two beers from the same co. with remarkable similar labels as far as color scheme and overall design goes...well the idjits put them side by side and I departed with this instead of the RIS goodness. So be it.

Turns out, for something I would never ever try, if not only on a dare, this one isnt too bad at all. As a homebrewer myself, I am fascinated by the process involved in making this one. The smoke is prevalent, yet subtle. There is even some dried fruit on the downtake, and a sweetness at the end. Well more than any balance I expected to find in a beer like this. All the same, finishing a mere 22oz bomber is a chore, unless you pour liquid smoke on your morning toast or something.

Its like hearing Stevie Ray Vaughan play Voodoo Chile, though. Alaskan so totally owns this style (for me), that this is just a happy reminder of how much I like Alaskan Smoked Porter/Hendrix.

187,"2006-05-23",3.3,"Perhaps out of curiosity and perhaps a certain masochism, I continually return to Stone for new challenges despite my apathy towards the brewery. Dont get me wrong, Stone produces quality beers, and with remarkably consistent standing - I simply cannot help questioning the excitement it generates within the craft brewing community. It may be for that reason that I persevere testing their range in hopes of an epiphany. Pouring the Porter produced a deep brown body that shines a woody rim in the light. A custard-colored mousse sits comfortably on top as the familiar aroma of chocolate rises from my goblet. The nose is straightforward but enjoyable: coffee, cream and berries mingle with the slight bitterness of chocolate as an unobtrusive smokiness lingers in the background. It may have been a rough day for my tastebuds as my sole notes regarding flavor read as follows: ""choco-HAM!"". I do recall the initial chocolate sweetness being brutally interrupted at the mid-palate by a dense smoky flavor, reminding of cured ham. I may need more experience with smoked beers in order to recognize the nuances from one to the next, but my sense was of a definite asymmetry. Not an unsatisfactory flavor, but a true lack of complexity and ""core"". Still not the Stone I am looking for...","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"
187,"2006-05-22",4.4,"poured a wonderful very dark, mostly black, dark dark reddish brown but still very clear.  also poured very smooth and fluid.  the head was of average size and was a nice brown/tan color.  i didnt notice any lacing, but the head did stay around for a decent amount of time with a little remaining around the edges towards the end.


as for aroma i mostly got a dark roasted scent with a very mild hint of dark chocolate and coffee.  best way to describe it was a nice clean dark roast.


i was suprised by just how mild of a smoke flavor this did have and was impressed by how smooth and balanced of a flavor it had as well.  again like the aroma there was a strong dark roasted flavor, but not overly powerful or bitter.  there was also a note of sweetness in both the start and finish, but mostly the initial flavor.


the most amazing thing, actualy left me in total awe, was just how light boddied the beer was.  with as dark as the beer looks you expect something much thicker, but it was actualy light and refreshing.  i would actualy say the body was in the medium light to medium area with a smooth but almost creamy texture.  there wasnt much for carbonation, but it was very soft through out the beer and fit the beer very well.

In an apparent contradiction, this beer smells both earthy and clean.  Maybe like a well-swept cabin with a dirt floor.  Can you clean dirt?  I dunno.  But it smells like clean dirt.  Moderate malty smell, big chocolate notes, faint campfire.  They definitely didnt overdo the smoke in the nose.  Nice to have a smoked that isnt asphyxiating.  Raisin and cola notes coming out stronger as the glass warms.  The aroma is surprising.  Kind of like a sophisticated lumberjack, and not what I was expecting at all.  Superbly balanced.  First gulp and the peat smoke comes out soft, then crescendos nicely.  Again, not overwhelming, but like the dying embers of last nights fire.  Some sweetness helped along by the chocolates presence.  Some musty basement too.  A beautiful, long, lightly bitter finish that carries wifts of smoke all the way to end.

It pours beautifully dark and clear, with a nice creamy head which subsides quickly into a drinkable thin film. Even though served quite warm, the flavor and mouthfeel didnt quite live up to what my eyes and nose had promised--I prefer porters that pack just a little bit more sweet, roasted maltiness--but it was still quite good, with the smoke flavor again perfectly balanced.

187,"2006-03-24",3.3,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2007 Stone has maintained an unusual track record of consistency.  Other breweries seem to deviate from any standards theyve set for themselves, sometimes letting down their beer devotees, and sometimes excelling beyond the expectation of any beer snob potentates.  But Stone has built a small beer empire by being expectedly strong and curiously good.  As far as my experience goes, the Imperial Stout brought me from childhood into manhood; the Ruination robbed me of 60% of my senses for a month; the Double Bastard leveled me on what was supposed to be a peaceful Friday evening.  But all that stopped, at once, when I had the Smoked Porter.  I suppose I was expecting something raw and barbaric.  The very word smoke connotes burning Nordic villages and masculine chop houses.  I think of the passion Prometheus had when he braved the Gods of olde and took their flame; I think of a thousand sieged castles, raging with a whisping cloud of opal black trailing towards the sky.  None of these, however, are present in Stones lighter, tamed Porter.  I suppose theres something in there that resembles the porter I dream of: the unctuously dark color, the dark fruits in the smell and taste, and the cackling cloud of hickory smoke.  But this is a mere simulacrum of what it should be.  I think its too weak, or that the beer is too far away from its tradition and roots.  A Stone fan desires strength and Hellish flames on their beer, not a paltry substitute!  No, this beer isnt up to Stones standards, I think.  Rather, it stultifies them.  How can any one brew master who puts berating comments on their bottles on the subject of Stones intensity settle for this?  The smoked porter is simply too far from what Stone settles for, and also far from what I expect and continue to expect from them.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Interesting nose of toffee, coffee, faint cola, and a campfire. This wasnt as well rounded as I was hoping, given Stones reputation and my recent experience with the Alaskan smoked porter, but this is solid none-the-less. All the porter characterisitcs are there: solid caramel foundation and roasted coffee. The smoke comes into play heavily in the finish which accents the bitterer notes quite well. Its quite ashy, almost puckering, but doesnt quite go beyond what the sweet malty foundation can balance. Easy drinking beer without being trite, but isnt an intense experience like Im accustomed to Stone delivering.

2008 bottle at Taco Mac. There is a distinct smoked quality on this brew, but it comes across more like an ash tray or pure smoke than meat or smoked food. The palate was surprisingly thin. By thin, I mean for a porter and more so a porter from Stone. Nice chocolate and nutty flavors come through while dark roasted coffee and cigarettes make up a sharper edge on the brew. For me, the tasteful, but gritty, smokiness really saves this brew.

bomber. Pours a deep, dark red. Kind of near black, but it is visibly red even in medium light. The aroma has some caramel and dough with a hint of gumminess. A decent chocolate and smoked tobacco scent is also present. The mouth is decent, kind of thin for Stone, but certainly not problematic. I definitely enjoy the flavor more than the aroma. Almost none of that gummy thing is on my palate. Its just creamy coffee with hints of smoked meat. The finish is rough with ashtray qualities, but I actually like that.

It displays the flavor profiles from a great porter: cocoa and coffee, along with the enhancement of some smoke that lies in the underbelly of this brew.

Chocolate flavor dominates the nose followed by roasted coffee, some floral hops, faint toffee, and a smoked meat hint.  Then the flavor is similar with the same components but richer without the meat tinge.  Roasted flavor really shows itself and the hop bitterness and smoke flavor takeover into the finish.  A perfectly balanced porter with the smoke adding the a nice compliment.  For someone who is a not a smoked beer fan, this was pretty good.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Aroma had definite chocolate notes, it had some coffee notes but not as smoky as I had assumed it would be. The smokiness was very toned down in the aroma. I could also detect hints of wet dirt or an earthiness to it. Mouthfeel was definitely full-bodied but it wasnt chewy at all. Flavor was very subtle as well, not the over-the-top smoky flavor I was expecting. This porter was very smooth and silky, having chocolate, coffee, smoke, peat and earthy tastes all throughout.

Take a well marbled porterhouse steak and throw it in a blender with a pound of brownsuger, and a few charcoal briquettes. Blend to puree and serve cold.

187,"2005-09-29",3.0,"Bottle from my Secret Santa.  I had planned on sharing this one, but nearly everyone I know has already had this one.  So, I popped the cap on this bomber and poured it into my glass.  The aroma has lots of chocolate and a light peat.  Unfortunately, by lots, its still pretty weak and is disappointing.  The appearance is an extremely dark red (you can catch a glimpse of light through it).  A thin beige head sits atop it.  The flavor starts with a lots of coffee flavors, mellows into some darker chocolate flavors, and finishes with a peat smoked malt.  The palate is medium bodied and mediocre.  I had high hopes for this beer but feel let down.  Its not as smoky as I had hoped.  Definitely a standard porter, not a good smoked porter.  I like my smoked beers to be strongly smoked and taste like strong smoked malts and meats.  This is the first Stone brew that fell very short.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"

187,"2005-09-21",0.9,"This is the first beer that my dog wouldn’t even drink... SERIOUSLY.  Some people may give this beer a free pass since it comes from the well-renowned Stone name, but this frankly was undrinkable.  The flavor encroached on burnt Folgers’ crystals steeped in tap water.  Very bitter, but not in any remotely pleasing way.  The aftertaste is what truly got me, however. This is where the ""smoked"" comes in -- only it is like stale cigarettes.  Seriously, it’s like a tea of burnt coffee and cigarettes.  And with each sip, I felt as if the beer was separating into two layers: something trying to pass as a beer and some ultra watery, smoky mess that was poured into it - like some poorly mixed oil and vinegar salad dressing.  A total drain pour after attempting to stomach half of the bottle.","Orange, California, USA","Heatwaves"

Some mild smoke in the aroma (think peat/whiskey barrel not rauch/smoked bacon) as well as citrus hops. Bitter flavor has the same mild smoke profile as the flavor (peat) as well as stong roasted malts (mocha coffee), caramel, spicey/citrus hops and fresh, dark fruits.

Damn drinkable. I cant think of another time that a beer has disappointed me so much but still delivered things I wasnt even looking for. Excellent!","Marietta, Georgia, USA","lagermonkey"

Slightly peaty nose is quickly enveloped by lusterous roast malt flavors.  Closer to the finish, the cocoa element fuses with the roastiness.  The tinge of smokiness returns in the finish, intermingling with residual cocoa and caramel flavors.  The mouthfeel is full but slightly crisp.  Lacks the oily astringency of a larger smoke character.","San Diego, California, USA","FoolishMortal"

The appearance is deep brown to walnut (though it was hard to tell at the club).  The flavor had smoked and toasted malts (though I think I needed to be told about the smoked part).  Also, nice flavors of coffee and semi-sweet chocolate.  The body was creamy with a finish of bitter pine.  Very good and some age did this some good (did not even rate it the first time about 1-year ago).  A bit heavier than I expected but that was a welcome surprise.

187,"2005-03-13",4.1,"Bottled.  Beautiful, clear walnut colored liquid on the pour; virtually opaque in the glass, has a golden quality to the color.  Head is tan, perfectly sized for a porter (when chilled; after sitting out, head got big, but still so beautiful), fully lasting and leaving behind wonderfully uniform rings with a uniform, complete, but not thick lace down the glass.  Aroma: ah, the smell of salted, smoked meat...bakers chocolate, slight alcoholic notes, sweet caramel and yeast like a sweet dough.  Vanilla and hazelnuts have crept in as the beer warmed and notable prune aroma as it was about room temperature, as well as some grapefruit rind.  Body is the thin side of medium with wonderfully creamy-smoothe carbonation (TINY bubbles) that lasts through the swallow of a  watery liquid underneath, blending things nicely.  Slightly dry; mouth waterying.  Flavor: hoppy little sucker!  Noticably bitter, with not only the burnt bakers chocolate expected, but with grapefruit rind and a touch of pine.  Alcohol is noticable on the back end and somewhat harsh.  Meek malts have a touch of honeyed sugar, slight caramel(mostly in the aftertaste), milk chocolate.  An overall harsh, earthy flavor; incredibly beautiful beer; great aroma and surprisingly refreshing for such a dark beer.  Its similarly refreshing to Obsidian Stout by Deschutes and shockingly wonderful for a porter--even with the Stone twists on style.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"

Bittersweet chocolate and a fairly strong roastiness with the hops becoming more noticable towards the finish before giving way to the smokey and roasty aftertatse.

187,"2004-10-31",4.0,"Thanks to sdbruboy for this!  Black color with a thick head.  Kind of a smoked coffee taste instead of a smoked malt.  Bitter coffee and chocolate taste.

187,"2004-10-31",3.6,"A difficult beer for me to rate. If I were to rate it just by its porter characteristics (creamy body, subtle roastiness, beautiful coffee, chocolate, hops interplay) it would be over a 4. However, the smoke quality, as subtle as it is, really spoiled it for me. I like smoked beers, and can appreciate using it as an ""element"" rather than the dominating factor, but the smoke in this beer tasted more like ash. This is still a GOOD beer and its very close to GREAT, but that final failing it very frustrating indeed!","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"

Not so roasty, mostly sweet smelling with some anise.  Very malty.  Flavor has a nice smoked quality, but more like smoke was an afterthought, or a mistake.  Not at all sweet.  Some raisin notes up front.  Very bitter finish makes it signature Stone.  Roastiness really lingers over a nice hop bite.  This is a beer that grows on me and really improves as the glass empties.  Could definitely stand for a more assertive smoke character.  It almost seems as though the beer is trying to avoid being smokey so that it wont be labeled a smoked beer...why?  Is smokey beer less marketable?

Later...I cant get over a certain grapefruit pithe flavor that keeps poking in its head and is rather annoying.

As a porter, this is a very good beer.  As a smoked porter, I think it falls short.  Ive rated the beer for what it is, a porter, and ignored that the label calls it smoked.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

The taste is refreshingly acidic (lemons mostly), and bitter-sweet chocolate with almonds, with a smoky grain flavor constantly lingering in the background.  There is also a hint of cracked peppercorn in the aftertaste.  The body is light on the palette, with a creamy smooth texture enhanced by the soft carbonation.  The finish is chalky and bone dry, leaving you craving the next sip.  The beer is amazingly drinkable, and would make a good companion on a hot summer day.  Stylistically, this is not quite a classic porter, but Stone is not known for their strict adherence to such things.  I say more power to them.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

There is a malt (patent/ roasted) astringency, coupled with some hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is very rich and creamy... chewable stuff. The aftertaste has a few smoke notes, but is still dominated by the dark malts and hops. Not a real rauchbier in my book, but a damn fine porter. I nuked the last part of this beer (oh, the heresy), and it brought out much more of the malt aromas, bready, and maybe some yeast notes. Flavor is much more complex warmed up to about room temp. Heck, maybe I'll turn it into coffee temp. next. Yummy!","Longmont, Colorado, USA","beeriodic"

It tastes far less smokey than I expected.  It is a little sour, and bitter - more like a stout than a porter.  I can't put my finger on what it tastes like, but I like it!  It is really creamy, almost like an oatmeal stout.  Truly a great beer.","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"

Well as with all Stone brews I have had so far this beer looks absolutlly great..deep mahogany brown beer..with some garnet accents when held to the light and on top a huge frothy tan head..great stuff.
Wow the aroma of this beer blew my mind..this is great stuff..roasted deep dark chocolate malts mixed with some great black coffee..and with a luxurious smokey smell below.
The taste is just as I described the aroma except I get that wondeful Stone creamieness..fantastic stuff.
Wonderful and smooth on the palate..with some great aftertatse.

Bittersweet aroma, some nuttiness actually, a bit of sweet coffee.  Immediately upon sipping, the smoothness and balance are felt.  Big flavors, subtle smokiness that lingers in the background and is actually barely perceptible.  More up front is a fairly large saltiness, with a touch of chocolate, lots of bittersweet malt.  Finish is pleasingly coffeeish, a touch of syrup, maple, coffee, salted beef.(ok not as bad as salted beef sounds).  Alcohol no where to be found.  Flavor is subtle, not hugely complex with twists and turns along the way, but a solid drinkable porter.

Very good, slightly quick but uniform lacing.  Nice solid nose with inviting smokiness and strong malt-- subtly sweet but very fine.  Taste is immediately darkly malty and smoky with a light sour edge like a dry stout.  Also very subtle hints of sweetness.  Medium-to-thin body with quick harsh bitterness.  Finish is surprisingly elegant but a little too darkly smoky and dirty for my tastes, quite long and interesting but not outstanding.  Another very solid beer from Stone.

I smell hops, chocolate, roasted malts, and I sense some alcohol--but with the ABV only 5.9 I wonder why; the aroma is a tiny bit harsh to me. Taste chicory, chocolate, coffee. towards the end, a nice bitterness, then a rush of roasted malt, then a little more bitterness, and then the peat flavor just inches out at the end, just for a second, to say hello. Then after Mr. Peat smoke has said goodbye, the previously generous mouthfeel gets a little thin. Just a little, though.

Carries a medium-to-thick bodied feel in the mouth with hefty carbonation.  Aftertaste is monstrously powerful, roasted everything: chocolate, coffee, oak chips, alcohol, furniture, phonebooks, and anything else you can heave into the fire.

Nonono, so much tastier than that.  I dont really smell any fruitiness to this beer any more, dont know if that was due to the original batch I had or me being stupid.  Lots of chocolate/coffee/roast/smoke as mentioned previously.  Hops are slightly present in the nose this time but undetectable in the flavor with roasty bitterness being completely dominant.  No chalkiness either.  I should probably go rerate some other early-acquired porters as well...

22 oz bottle, pint glass.  Average sized, tan head diminishes quickly.  Black body is cola-like in appearance.  Malt smells of roasted, bitter chocolate, light coffee.  Hops are very light.  Flavor contains hints of dark chocolate and dark bitter fruits...all smoked of course.  Smoke adds a roastiness to this beer which is complimentary, not dominant.  Body is lighter than I thought it would be but is still medium and creamy.  Hops add a definite bitter zing to the finish.  Slight chalkiness in the finish.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Taste is quite exceptional, excellently done of smooth sweet chocolate up front, tones of roastyness settle in quickly of smoked black malts. Rich, luscious, and a super interior hop bitterness of mild abode that picks up in the finish with some more roasty smokeyness and hoppy, earthed bitterness and slight dryness of coffee and twinged chocolate late. Good full feel, solid creamyness all through and an excellent lingering finish of slight smoke, what a shock; not.

The flavor initially smacked of spruce, with a touch of a gum flavor from my childhood called pepsin.  As it warmed, the spruce faded, the bitter chocolate came forward a bit, and the smoke served a nice complimentary, but not at all dominating role.  Interesting, and remarkably refreshing in nature.

Medium bodied, smooth, almost creamy wih wonderful roasted, sweet malt flavors that blanket the evident but not obvious smoke character. Hints of coffee bitterness throughout, not much in the way of chocolate overtones but no matter, this is fantastic.

It pours with a large light brown rocky head, which diminishes slowly and leaves good lacing patterns.  The aroma is smokey, peaty and inviting.  Tastes better than it smells - particularly after warming a bit.  Rich, smokey toasted malt, coffee, molasses and enough hops to balance the sweetness.

Subtle sweetness followed by hearty roasted malts and a dash of smokeyness. Head was persistant and the languid liquid dark and inviting. However the last several drinks began to taste like my grampa's old cough medicine. You know, like molasses, vicks rub and rusty nails. I'm sure this is due to the hoppy overtones not quite characteristic of this style. Regardless, the overall experience was positive.","Salem, Missouri, USA","humulus"

187,"2003-04-06",4.2,"A moderately sweet and just slightly smoky aroma. A nice thick, tan with medium sized bubble head. Im shocked a subtle beer from Stone! Just a little sweet, mellowed out with just the slightest sour note. Plenty of roasted malt flavors but far from over done. A nice full mouth feel but not overwhelming. Maybe there is just a little more hop bitterness than some porters have but still this beer is in balance. And as to the smoked part of it, well you might not notice it at all if you normally work in a smokehouse and that is what your looking for. Again Stone has not allowed the smoke to take over but its there adding its flavor to a great smoked porter","Enumclaw, Washington, USA","Verne"

187,"2003-03-24",4.0,"Opaque black beer with crisp tan head that fades quickly to tan lacing.  Oily, chocolately, coffe taste and much more interesting than a porter, with smokey peat and bitter cascade hops on top of the usual simple porter dark malt.  Sweet and bitter finish, with lingering smokiness.  I did not expect to like it, since I don't like rauchbieres or porters.  This was great, and an unanticipated delight.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"
187,"2003-03-24",3.6,"While I totally missed any suggested smokiness, I found this light bodied, oily porter to be chock full of great flavors. Huge oatmeal, chocolates, and gourmet coffees.

That was a little overwhelming whereas this was more tolerable. Good beer.","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"

An excellent porter.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","jpfrog"

The smoked aspect of the flavor is very evident, and is enjoyable.  The body is pretty thin, especially for a porter.  The hop bitterness in the finish is a bit unenjoyable, which surprised me considering stone seems to be great at creating the perfect hop finish.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

I found my self taking 3 or four tastes before I even got a feeling for this Porter. It was a very mild taste that escaped me for a few moments. It had almost no before or after taste.

During the pour you can see the yeast but as the glass fills it becomes completely black. The flavor is good but I prefer the taste of Youngs Double Chocolate better but this is still great.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","FezMonkey"
187,"2003-02-13",4.0,"Nice dark brownish-black color with a cream colored head that held down to the bottom.

187,"2003-02-10",3.9,"Thick and Black. . . A large off white white bubbly head sounds like rice krispies.  A pleasant smoky aroma, contains small amounts of bacon and ham, but more roasted oats and malt than other smoked beers I have had, though light in alcohol content, a small amount of sweet alcohol is also present in the aroma.  Creamy mouth feel, definitely a good amount of smoke on the palate, but wonderfully balanced by chocolate, roasted malts and even a touch of hops in the finish.  Wonderfully done Smoke.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
187,"2003-02-09",3.9,"This one poured a glacial black with noticeable lively carbonation and the most beautiful creamy tannish orange head i have just about ever seen and tasted across my palate and my lips. The aroma danced coffee and roasty smokiness and malt. Almost hints of an aged quality to the gargantuan beast. The taste cries of coffee, espresso, a thin chocolateness, and oh that smokey quality. A bit thin in retrospect given the smokeyness, but still unbelievable. That creamy head provides a break between the smokey carbonation and the bittering hop ending. A subtlely wet ending for a smoked porter. Very delectable, now if only one could find the perfect women to go with a damn good beer we'd be set.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"
187,"2003-02-07",3.7,"I will preface this with the fact that I am not a fan of smoke flavor in anything. So, I am trying to rate it without my own personal bias. It was very dark black with a really light tan head. Low carbonation that is usually associated with this style. Smoked aroma with coffee and roasted malts. The smoke aroma was not artificial like it is with some other smoked beers. The roasted malts really come through and the smoke is subtle yet very present. Some bitter chocolate flavor are also present.","Portland, Oregon, USA","microdyke"

187,"2003-01-31",4.4,"Fantastic beige head on an extremely dark brown beer.  Great head retention and lace on glass.  Roast barley nose backed up by hints of smoked malts, but not overpowering.  Toffee/caramel and very, very slight fruitiness in the back ground along with some hops that become more prevalent as beer warms(cascade?). Lightly roasty/coffee flavor and smokiness are very appealing to me, toffee mid palate and finishes dry, but not astringent.  Only drawback I can find is a little over carbonation which is a little prickly on the tongue and there is a slight hop bitterness in the aftertaste, although very subdued from other Stone offerings. Overall, this is a fantastic beer.  The smoked peat is in the background the entire time and doesn't overpower like some traditional rauchbiers like Schlenkerla or Kaiserdom.  Just my personal preference.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

187,"2003-01-03",3.4,"More tame than most Stone beers that Ive tried, the Smoked Porter still has a bit to live up to.  It certainly tastes drinkable, but has a bitter edge.  It isnt to hopped up, but doesnt have the smooth edge of other Porters, like Anchors.  Tastes like smoked teriaki jerky with a kick.  Has a bit of bite on the finish.  Im missing the  ""chocolate"" taste that Ive tasted in cheaper, more watery brews.  It lacks malt definition for a porter.  Overall, its not bad, but not something Id drink every day.","Illinois, USA","zborgerd"

187,"2002-12-30",3.8,"Unexpected citrus aroma from this beer. It turns out to be a pleasant aroma/flavor to compliment what is essentially a great porter. The aroma seemed one-dimensional...just the hops and very little if anything else. The flavor, however, was huge, rounded out by roasty, smokey, chocolatey tones. The feel was pure creaminess...silky with just the right amount of carbonation. A snappy hops finish ends the experience perfectly.","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"

187,"2002-12-21",3.2,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2003 14Jan2003 Update: After some prodding (from the brewer, no less), I 
decided to clarify this rating.  The beer is not 
bitter by absolute standards, but it is (in my opinion)
over-bittered in the sense that it overwhelms the unique and
subtle flavors present in the beer.  Re-rate ASAP.
<hr>
(20Dec2002--22oz bottle) Reading the commercial description, the smokiness of this smoked porter is indeed subtle.
Unfortunately, the hop bitterness of this beer is anything BUT subtle.
In what seems to be a recurring theme from this brewer, excessive bitterness undermines what would otherwise be a unique and wonderful beer.
The beer is totally opaque.  Its head is lumpy, rust-colored, fine-textured, very lacy, and provides a nicely persistent effervescence to the beer.
The aroma is surprisingly mild; a little smoky, with some malt and alcohol.
Flavor: starts bitter, ends bitter, bitter in the middle.  In the midst of the bitterness, I did actually taste wonderful smokiness and tasty roasted malt.
The beer has perfect mouthfeel.  Hop heads love this, but I think you can make a pretty convincing argument that the level of bitterness in this beer detracts from its overall quality.","Stanford, California, USA","mpbro"

Pleasant tart/tangy bitterness and hints of sweetness. Really nice taste but hard to nail down elements other than bitter roasty malts.

Flavor and mouthfeel do not blow me away, oily as ARMed mentions, rather viscous, very low carbonation -- kinda seems to stick going down, not so hot -- and the flavor is just not all that distinctive or interesting, mostly roasted grain, slight raisiny notes, and a very slight smokiness. Hey, dont call it smoked unless the average joe can say, mmm, bacon. Does get a little sweeter, a little smokier, as it gets near room temp.  Dont drink cold!","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

I have grown to expect a lot from Stone - an amazing brewery deserves some sort of rediculous expectations - but this porter wasnt simply outstanding like the Imperial Stout or the IPA.

Smoke, alcohol and just a hint of charcoal comes through in the nose as well. The color of the beer is dark brown to black and the light brown, creamy head is average in size and mostly lasting. The lacing is good. Initially, in flavor, the beer is moderately sweet and lightly bitter. On the back side, its lightly acidic and moderately bitter.

Thats the dominate aspect of the character, or at least the middle anyway. The beginning is more a good porter, warm and malty without crossing into stout territory. The ending is bitter hops with the lingering stale smoke. Actually, given the almost pitch black color and tan head of this beer, Im surprised the malt doesnt play a stronger role in the flavor of this beer.

Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Rated in the same session as the Vanilla and Chipotle versions. Simple, ordinary nose with almost no smoke character.

The aroma is coffee, not smoke, and the flavor has coffee and chocolate.  It isnt really until the finish that you catch the hint of smoke, which is all very well balanced with a touch of hoppy bitterness.  It is a remarkably stately beer, with every flavor balancing with something else just behind, which makes it almost like Beethoven -- sometimes shockingly stark, but always balanced out.  I would seek this beer out again.","Washington DC, USA","Kathy"

187,"2002-03-14",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 10, 2006 Richly roasty and chocolaty with a lush blanket of light but complementary smoke. Nice verison:  Understated and elegant.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

187,"2002-02-13",4.3,"roasted/smokey malt. some coffee-ness. nice flavor. top quality porter.  Best drunk by itself. I havent found another beer that follows it well, nor a food to pair it with.  just sip it while reading a good book.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
187,"2002-02-13",4.4,"Can’t see too many faults with this one. Great mix of flavors, impressive smoothness and dryness in the finish. Very well built and balanced. As for the previous complaints of lack of smoke, did they change the recipe? Its definitely more of a dry roasted finish but the smokiness certainly comes through mid-palate.","California, USA","BeerLimey"
187,"2001-12-29",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 13, 2003 Re-rate 12/13/2003: This is an extremely well balanced porter. A bit of hoppiness up front, w/ roastiness and malt flavors that follows. The smokey taste is nicely in the background. It poured black with a cream off white head. 
An excellent beer. A lt/med bodied porter w/ a great taste.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
187,"2001-12-22",4.0,"One of my all time top porters. Thin body but very flavorful malt..chocolate/coffee flavor with just a touch of fruitiness. A little less smokiness in the finish than what I expected but that certainly doesnt kill the beer. In fact, what makes this beer so great is all in the finish, as the strong malt and moderate hop presence melts perfectly on the palate.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
187,"2001-12-07",4.3,"Great color and aroma, off in a little in the flavor, maybe more coffee taste would be appropriate","Torrington, Connecticut, USA","jbak"
187,"2001-11-29",4.3,"Nice porter body with just a hint of smoke.Really tasty.","Smithfield, Virginia, USA","bonvivant"
187,"2001-10-23",3.7,"Great roasty malt flavor with a slight touch of smoke leading to the dry finish. A really nice beer from stone. I love porters and this one was a classic.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Jake Barnes"
187,"2001-09-22",4.6,"Another great beer from the stoners. I never knew porter could be smoked, but a brewery named stone could probably do it.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
187,"2001-06-16",2.4,"I have a question: wheres the smoke?! Honestly, I detected NO smoke in this beer, and that steams my clams. I mean sure, its a decent porter, but if it advertizes smoke, then by Crom, I want smoke!","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
187,"2001-04-07",4.4,"A superb beer. This stuff is just
gorgeous!! A deep mahogany color.
Nice and roasty. I question the smokey claim.
I think its very good. But I dont pick up on anything
other than roasty notes in the nose and flavor. Im a big fan
of peated malts and smoked beer and I just didnt taste the 
distinction here. Dont get me wrong though..this is an awesome
brew. Id highly recommend it.
But its no rauchbier. ;-)","Sandy, Utah, USA","opiate"
187,"2000-12-03",3.4,"Chocolatey, dry, with good complexity and balance, but only a touch of smoke.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
187,"2000-06-24",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2005 Complex and full of flavor ... in a ""mild"" sort of way. Chewy, smooth, sweet, and kind of heavy ... but also kind of light, in a curious way. Alcohol warms the throat gently. Smoke is kind of mild, and has some soft notes of tobacco. Sticky sweetness is accented by a little wood. Nice.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
