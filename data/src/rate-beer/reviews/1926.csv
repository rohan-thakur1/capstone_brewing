Long toasty malt finish with a bit of hop bitterness. A bit too heavy on the malt in my opinion. Makes it a little hard to drink. Pretty much overwhelms your taste buds. Not a bad taste, mind you.

1926,"2013-08-06",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 5, 2013 12 oz bottle from a mix 12-pack.

This is a fine and fine-looking beer. Deep reddish amber body iscovered by a durable and creamy tan head. Excellent lacing. 
The aroma and flavor are both less hop forward than the classification as an APA would lead you to expect. In this casee, I think it is due to the larger load of sweet and medium roast malts rather than a shortage of hops. In any case, the beer is sweet up front and only mildly bitter in the aftertaste, with at least as much roast and caramel malt flavor as there is hops (Cascade and Fruggle in this case).

1926,"2012-04-23",3.1,"Originally reviewed: 6/9/10. Grabbed a bottle of this at Wolfs Premium Nuts and Wines in Findlay, OH. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. 

Pours a very dark amber. Much darker than expected. A big frothy off-white head caps this off. Decent retention; leave some pretty sip rings and sticky lace. Scents of toasted caramel, sweet tea, and fresh toffee. Different.

The body on this crisp, but its a tad heavy. The flavor profile of this beer is much maltier than expected. Lots of caramel sweetness, some tea, and a little charring on the finish. Hop presence is surprisingly absent. Bitterness is moderate. This is odd. I guess Im probably pushing the limits on the the freshness of this bottle (as spring-releases are probably released in the winter), so I could expect the hops to fade. But upon further inspection of other reviews, this seems to be the norm for this beer.

Basically, the beer attempts to replicate an old style of Cincinnati brewing by incorporating German malty flavors.  Great beer at summer and fall festivals in Cincinnati.  It seemed that for a while Warsteiner was trying to monopolize the festival beer carts, but now Moerlein has entered the competition and has done well.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Lyncham"

1926,"2009-08-16",3.5,"Let me just say Im not digging the name for this beer. OTR. Over-the-Rhine. Not being from Cincinnati, the reference is entirely lost on me, so I had little knowing of what kind of beer I even had beyond an ale with, per the tiny-font text I was struggling to read on the back label, Fuggles hops. O-kay!

Appearance: Pours out a faintly hazy, dark amber body with a sudsy, white head.

Smell: Pale malts with a distinct scent of toasted biscuits, meager hint of fruit, and an aroma of spicy, floral Noble hops.

Taste: Pale malts with some toasty, biscuity qualities and a small touch of toffee sweetness. Faint fruit esters. Earthy, spicy, floral hop character with a medium-low amount of bitterness. As is often the case, it starts drying out on the back half for the finish, but theres still some maltiness to be found. Then its gone - Over-the-Rhine and In-My-Stomach.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: A reasonably decent, quaffable ale, though, I will say its the best of the Moerleins lot that Ive had thus far. I will also say thats not saying much.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

1926,"2008-08-05",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2008 Ive been a Cincinnati area native all of my life, so when Christian Moerlien released their first tribute beer to one of the nations oldest authentic German brewing meccas, I must say I was pretty pumped.  This is a very well-crafted beer that I thoroughly enjoyed.  It has a nice foaming head thats short lived, but leaves a small white ring atop a beautiful coppery mahogany body.  The aroma is intensely aromatic, with loads of fresh hops, and a very sweet, almost mapley smell from the malt.  This is followed by notes of raisins, dates, and dark brown sugar. The taste is where the hops start to shine: the cascade bringing the full-on fresh, piney citrus, and the fuggles bringing that mellow, subdued English bitterness.  However, this beer is ridiculously well-balanced: nutty sweet, toasted malt, honey, ripe fruits, and spicy, burnt candied yams are all present.  Rather than calling this a pale ale, I see it as more of a well hopped brown ale.  Beautifully crafted, this was a lesson in balance I wont soon forget.","Independence, Kentucky, USA","shalloWMeans"

1926,"2008-04-25",3.0,"Quite a mix of hops and fruit are noticeable in the nose as I pour this beer.  It starts out with a two-finger thick, lightly amber tinged, tan colored head.  The beer shows a brilliantly clear, plum-amber color as it sits in my 25cl tulip glass.  Bright berry aromatics, a zesty bergamot aroma, some light herbal notes all over a backdrop of biscuit-like malt and lightly browned whole-grain crackers.  This has an enjoyable nose, I like, and wasnt expecting, the vibrant hop character.

Sweetish tasting and quite thick and chewy for a beer of this strength.  There is a soft tartness to this beer, that lightly accents a lemon & orange zest flavor.  Thick malt flavors of concentrated wort, and ample crystal malts make this a bit unbalanced.  This is definitely quite a bit thicker than I like in a beer of this strength, though it is not nearly as sweet as a beer of this body might suggest.  The hop character provides more of a pine-like flavor than the zesty fruit notes noticed in the aroma.  The beer finishes with a herbal, slightly astringent hop bitterness that does a fair job of scrubbing away the over-bearing malt (though not quite completely).

The flavor is a complete surprise after the fresh, vibrant, hoppy nose.  I wish the balance of up front hop and supporting malt had been carried through to the flavor.  Instead the flavor is just way unbalanced with this way under-attenuated malt character.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

As a fan of the band Over the Rhine I had to try this as soon as I discovered that it existed.  I finally tracked it down at the Party Source across the river from Cincinnati.  Once my last bottle is empty I may have to pick up some more (or have someone else pick it up when they visit from that area).  The price is right for a well made beer ($7.99 a six pack).
Aroma / Apppearance - A one finger eggshell colored head decorated the glass for a while.  Underneath was a reddish orange body.  Toffee, caramel and gingerbread cookies make this the ideal winter alternative to an imperial stout.  Woody hops play against citrus flavors to form an aggressive attention getter with sweet overtones.
Flavor / Palate - The fast fading flavor is hard to pick up at first but eventually settles into Hersheys kisses, Cherry 7UP and malts.  The hops are present without being overwhelming.  The tart sprucy finish completes a satisfying transformation.  This is a solid sessionable beer that would be great for watching during the football game or while out ice fishing.

Very drinkable and a good APA.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1926,"2007-08-07",4.6,"One word...malt malt malt...with good hops. I went to the first keg tapping at Findley Market and was immediately impressed even though the beer wasnt served at the optimum temperature. Great caramel flavor intensifies at the end with a clean finish. I bought a couple six-packs and then went the 1/6 barrel route. I am now close to purchasing my thrid sixth barrel since my neighbors appear to like this beer as much as I do. By far, the best Christian Morlein beer to date.","Amelia, Ohio, USA","smartbrewing"
1926,"2007-07-19",4.0,"12oz bottle.  Nice red amber with med beige head.  Aroma is dough, some fruitiness, sweet malt.  Banana, slight pine bitterness, big malt, with great balance some caramel and dark fruit as well.  Med-full body with creaminess.  A lot better then I was expecting, almost barleywine in consistency.","Grand Rapids/Chicago, Michigan, USA","xnoxhatex"
1926,"2007-07-17",4.3,"Draft.  First tried this brew at the first tapping event at Findlay Market in OTR.  Now have it on draft at home.  This beer is amber in color and pours with a nice head and good retention.  Aroma is soft and gentle...which is very inviting.  At first sip, the beer is quite impressive.  Crisp, clean, and very enjoyable.  Lots of malts, yet enough hops to balance well.  Nice caramel tones in there as well.  This beer finishes very clean and leaves no aftertaste.  Much better at home then at debut tapping...I believe this is due to the temperature at which it was served.  This beer tasts best to me at colder temperatures.  Proud to say this one is from my home town.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","ghouseguy"
1926,"2007-07-06",3.8,"Bottle: This one poured amber in color with a medium white head. Smell is a bit piney, with some caramel and even some vanilla notes in there. Its kinda hard for me to describe, its an interesting aroma. The taste is as hard to describe as the smell, but I do get even more of a caramel and pine feel. I also notice a soft earthiness to it and even some dark fruit. At first, this one battled with the palate over who will reign supreme, but the palate and the beer are now meshing and this is a nice enjoyable beer. The only thing in Over The Rhine that is this good is another brewery... Locals hopefully know the one.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","cewldre"
1926,"2007-07-05",3.5,"Pours an amber color with an off-white head.  Aroma is of plenty of pine hops with caramel, dark fruits, and sweet malts.  Flavor starts off with decent malt tones that give way to a slight hop bitterness on the finish.  Overall this is a pretty good beer but it really is too malty for a pale ale.  After saying that this is still a decent, respectable brew that I will look forward to having again.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Lowe1983"
1926,"2007-07-03",3.6,"On tap in Loveland, OH.  Amber in color with a full off-white rocky head that stays.  Pleasant hop flower and bread dough aroma.  Taste is maple and caramel sweet malt with mild yet assertive dry hop character.  Yummy!  Moerlein products are good, but I would suggest this is their best offering.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
1926,"2007-06-16",3.1,"Aroma is biscuity malts. Flavor is much the same with a slight hop profile but the malt is the main player here. A little to thick bodied for my ""pale ale"" taste. Its not to bad overall, but its definitely not for those hot summer days. Shigadeyo profiled it better than I could, but you get the idea.","Covington, Kentucky, USA","bethmatt0421"
1926,"2007-06-02",2.1,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2017 5/07/2007:  Moerlein O.T.R. (Over-the-Rhine) Ale pours a clear amber color with a lasting, foamy beige head that leaves thick lacing on the glass.  There is a flurry of visible carbonation that is both lively and hypnotic to watch.  Caramel and buttery malt are most noticeable in the aroma.  This beer has a nice, malty backbone that is substantial, but not too heavy.  There is a hint of something roasty hiding in there as well.  The malt is balanced by a nice, soft, mild hoppy finish that is slightly floral.  This beer has a medium body and is smooth and slightly creamy on the palate.  O.T.R. is very good, but Im not sure that I would consider it to be a Pale Ale as it is mostly malty with a minimal level of hops and bitterness (although Im not really sure what style category it would fit into...).  Other than that, not only is it exciting to finally get a new Christian Moerlein beer, but it might possibly the best Christian Moerlein beer to date!  Rating: 7/7/8/7/15 = 3.8
12 oz bottle from Tmoney99.  Thanks Tom!______________________________3/22/2017: Wow, what a disaster this beer has become. Had a can of it at a friends house and besides being filled an inch short, the beer is pretty bad and nothing like it once was. OTR has become a mess of scorched malt, browned butter, and herbal/earthy hops that die on the palate. Blah!  This was confirmed by trying from a bottle the same night. Its no wonder why I no longer seek out Moerlein beers or support them anymore... Rating: 5/3/4/3/6 = 2.1","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"
1926,"2007-05-21",3.4,"Bright copper color with a taller taupe head and nice lace. Heavy caramel aromas along with melon, sweet oranges, dare I saw circus peanuts, and lemon zest. Very full and distinctive aroma, just not sure if I like it that much yet. Quite full and smooth in feel. They have the looks and palate down for me, but Im still working on the aroma and flavor. Just too sweet in the aroma for me to embrace. It amazes me that 75% of the reviews so far mention the Fuggles and Cascade hops. Yeah there are hops, but not the big grapefruit of Cascade or major Fuggle nuances. Oh well. Sweet lightly toasted malt, with an emphasis on sweet, lead the way. Somewhat spice hops, with a touch of cinnamon and orange zest that bites in the finish. Linger is somewhat drab with nondescript malt and a herbal hops residue. Interesting, but certainly no gem in my book.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1926,"2007-05-16",4.5,"Delicious pale ale reminiscent of a style of beer brewed in Cincinnati in an era of limited refrigeration and before the arrival of lager yeast. Presentation is outstanding with a beautiful brown / red color, a frothy tan head that lasts and lasts and leaves a fine lace pattern on the glass. Nice hops aroma is very inviting. Big malty flavor and body provide myriad of flavor notes. But the best part is a zesty hops flavor from healthy doses of Fuggles and Cascades. Overall, a well balanced and satisfying pale ale that loves to please.","Maineville, Ohio, USA","Beer Guy99"
1926,"2007-04-30",3.6,"On tap and in 12 ounce bottle at the OTR Ale Festival.  Pleasant citrus/floral aroma, medium brown color with reddish tones, nice juxtaposition of the three malt combo with the Cascade and Fuggles hops, zesty finish.  Bottled version is good but draft (which is what Im basing this rating on) is better, with more hop character and better balance.  Bottle version would probably be around 3.2.  Another solid offering from Moerlein and, imo, their best yet.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Drjohnrock"
1926,"2007-04-28",3.6,"Bottle from Party Town. Poured dark amber color with an average frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Solid balanced hoppy and malty aroma. Medium body with soft carbonation. Medium balanced bittersweet flavor with a medium smooth bitter finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
