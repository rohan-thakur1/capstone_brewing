Pours a hazy amber color with a thin off-white head and not much lacing. The nose carries some light notes of hops plus a bit of oak and a mild sourness. Fairly pleasant, though a bit odd. As it warms, an unfortunate acetic character comes through. The flavor is about the same--starts out with a moderate pleasing sourness along with a few hoppy notes and then gets hit pretty hard with some acetic character, which is then very, very apparent in the finish. Pretty cool concept, though it went a bit astray.

1240,"2010-08-09",3.5,"Fliptop bottle courtesy of Derek.  Version aged in wine barrels I believe.

Pours a deep, slightly hazy amber with a big bubbly head that recedes to a thick collar and leaves spotty lacing.

The aroma has some clean, crisp caramel malts with some sweet apples and toasted bread.  But the most interesting aspect is the lightly sour, vinous aroma with hints of sour cherries and oak.  Interesting.

The taste is even more sour with the initial taste being the tart cherries and acidic barrel character.  The caramel malts and bread are present in the background but its less prevalent than the dry wine-like presence.  The finish is dry and oaky with a red wine presence.

The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated with a dry tannic presence and a bit of funk.

This is a different take on a doppelbock with the uniqueness of the wine barrel really taking things in a different direction.  Another interesting from The Livery.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

1240,"2009-11-16",3.5,"Amber/copper color, hazy. A very small off-white head that settles quickly. Basically no lacings.

Kind of a weird smell thats hard to get a grip on. Plenty of barrel notes, oak and funky wet hay, and gentle yeast aromas coupled with malts and fading citric and spicy hops.

The taste is also rather strange with a composition of very different flavors. Big barrel notes and oak. Some funk (dust, wet hay and leaves rather than horse blanket and aged cheese). Gentle spicy hops with minimal hints of sweet fruits. Caramel and malts. Some salt flavors. Vanilla. The hops are restrained. The finish is mildly bitter with quite boozy alcohol.

Medium body, smooth yet somewhat sticky. Gentle carbonation.

D: Kind of a weird beer, yet interesting. Slightly unbalanced, but it manages quite well to hold together a set of very divergent flavors and aromas.

1240,"2009-03-30",3.5,"From a 750mL Bottle.  Somewhat hazy, golden body with hints of orange and a finger of quickly dissipating white head.  Bold aromas of lemony noble hops jump out of the glass right away, along with a subtle musty, cherry-like brett character.  Not really getting much vanilla or distinctive spicy oak characters coming through, so the oak appears to be revealing itself more in the brett presence.  Peaches, pineapple, and hints of honey malt sweetness.  Medium-full bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel with a rich, malty texture.  The base beer is definitely more mai-bock in nature than doppelbock, although after the dry-hopping and barrel-aging, the malt make-up becomes kind of a moot point.  A mild tartness comes out up front on the palate, followed closely by a pleasant herbal hop bitterness edged with lemon.  Strangely, the malt sweetness comes out on the near the back end, giving it a bit of a doughy, bready sweetness.  Finishes moderately hoppy, with some musky brett left lingering on the palate.  Remarkably dry, although the once presumably-hefty malt presence doesnt appear to be missing texture-wise.  Thanks, Sean!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
1240,"2009-03-30",3.8,"750mL Bottle. Aroma casts a strong waft of catty coconut and citric acids. Tangy and unripe fruit pith. Nice, but confusing at this point. Pours a orangey-amber, with a rim of white. Flavor starts quickly with some pineapple Brett and some sweet pale molasses. Foamy. Crisp funkiness that melds into a run of some very citrus-like plain hop oils. Malts take a back seat to some coconut frosting and bit of sponge cake. Long lemon hop oil finish. A few cookie-like malts perk up in the back. Im not sure what this is shooting for, but its very enjoyable. Confusingly off-style, but the character of this beer is nice. Lots of fruitiness from some barrel funk working well with a nice hand of hops and a kiss of malt texture. Thanks so much Sean for my first Livery beer!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

1240,"2007-08-10",3.4,"Draught samples at ABF on 6/16/07A heller bock malt profile, with czech pils hopping and dry-hopping, it actually smelled somewhat on par with a czech pils, though the hopping rate is quite a good deal higher than a traditional pils, not surprisingly.  Incredibly herbal, leafy, spicy hops are soaked in honey and sweet cookie dough-like malts, as an odd cotton candy and bubble gum-meets-pineapple note emerges.  Wow, thats certainly unique.  Not very bock-like, with, perhaps, only a touch of yeast dryness on the finish.  Sweet and spicy, with just tons of soft bubble gum and pineapple.  It almost melds together to give off a note of maraschino cherries.  Very high strength of aroma, and certainly very interesting, though I have no idea if this was intended.  No alcohol, anyways, and it didnt seem overly sweet for what was there.Soft, honeyish and bready malts comfort the palate, as some hop dryness begins to balance.  A touch of passing earthiness follows, and quickly transitions in to a hugely fruity (cherry, pineapple, apple, pear) finish dotted with strong herbal hop notes.  Very low carbonation, leading to a bit too much stickiness.  Definitely would like to see more dryness and even more hop bitterness to balance this odd mix of malt and ester sweetness.  Alcohol well-concealed.  Very unique, thats for sure.  I suppose the barrel could be the culprit for creating all of these esters?  Perhaps it sat warm at some point and the yeast went crazy?  The only problem with that theory is that the beer isnt all that much attenuated.
