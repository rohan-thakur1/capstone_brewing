497,"2017-04-18",4.7,"33 cl bottle served in snifter (which I strongly recommend) . Pours pitch black, no light seems to escape this black hole ale. Tan to tawny head at first is tremendous, bubbly and ever-growing, then diminishes quickly and vanishes almost completely, except for a thin espresso-coloured layer that remains all the time. Aroma is intense, very intense, and full of cask-related scents: smoke, leather, bacon, campfire, tobacco, coffee beans, espresso, cedar bark... Some bitter herbs are present as well, some nuts (mostly walnuts and hazelnuts) and a tinge of orange peel. Mouthfeel is, to begin with, creamy. Man, do I like this oily soft mouth-covering sensation! Carbonation is restricted, of course, but present. Some sweetness and umami and sourness balance the high alcohol contents and the almighty bitterness that make this gigantic yet gentle monster linger long after swallowing, when more and more smoke comes to you.

497,"2016-01-22",3.2,"12 oz. bottle, pours jet black with a humungous tan head (that cant be right). Aroma brings out lots of wood, with a slight bourbon quality, followed by feint coffee and oats. Flavour is quite harsh, with loads of bitter roasted malt dominating upfront, with secondary notes of coffee, and further back, oats. Only get a touch of wood, but its not a barrel-heavy beer. More just getting harsh roast notes, which leaves a rather abrasive astringency on the finish. Mouthfeel is a tad thin. Something seems a touch off-base here, what with the towering head, harsh roastiness and thin mouthfeel (compared to other Beer Geek Breakfast versions). Still, good, but not one of the better ones in the series. And at $12+, this is a rip off for the quality.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

Aroma of roasted malts, bitter hops, plastic, chocolate. Not really getting any barrel character here at all. Maybe some tequila, but its very faint. As it warms, I get a little bit of wine barrel.

Chocolate dominates the taste, little bit of coffee in there too. Not much else. The mouthfeel is so carbonated its hard to dig in to this, its prickly on the tongue and drys away faster than it should.

Body is full enough for style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Pretty much and over the top though retains enough drinkability.

497,"2016-01-04",3.4,"Best by 9/7/27 enjoyed January 4, 2016 in a Mad Elf tulip/snifter.

Look - This EXPLODES. I poured this cold beer (right from the fridge) down the edge of the glass and it still wasnt contained. It quickly filled the snifter so had to pour the rest in to a 24 oz glass. The head has very thick bubbles. It does not die down quickly. Body is dark brown with a light red tint. 

Smell - There is the smell of a a highly carbonated wheat beer. Once you get by that there is chocolate, coffee, fruit, raisin, wine, etc (a lot). 

Taste - Wheat. Coffee. Dark chocolate. Red wine. Char. 

Feel - I can already feel it coming back up in belches. Doesnt sit well. No alcohol taste just super bubbly. 

Overall - I had very high hopes from this. I was wondering how it could be better than the other varieties. I cant get by the explosive head and feel.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","madelfonatree"

497,"2015-12-13",4.5,"For all their differences, the Bjergso share a mutual desire to push the boundaries of (dark) beer to ridiculous extremes. Evil Twins Bozo included a long grocery list of added ingredients and (allegedly) tasted great. Big Blend seems to be the answer to that mode of thinking. The other Bjergso brothers brew is a blend of six barrel-aged beers. Big Blend? More like big understatement. For all its diverse influences, Big Blend ends up smelling like a focused Oatmeal Stout. Theres the usual notes of cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, licorice, and just a bit of alcohol-soaked cherry. Big Blend is technically the most beautiful Stout Ive seen. Extremely heady - especially given the high gravity. Dark pour and chocolate-colored suds. Flavors of bittersweet chocolate, fresh coffee, cream, and subtle dark fruits. Feel is rich, full, smooth.

Black body, with a big, creamy, moderately lacing, coffee-colored head.

Full, creamy mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation.
Finishes roasty, medium bitter, dry, with wood, coffee, cocoa, liquorice, some barrel notes, subtle alcohol warmth.

497,"2015-08-23",3.8,"Az előzetes információk alapján a világ egyik legjobb sörével lehet dolgunk a Big Blend személyében, legalábbis ha a Beer Geek-alapot, s azt vesszük számításba, hogy bourbon-, brandy-, meggybor-, konyak-, tequila- és whisky hordók szolgáltak az érlelés alapjául. Ami a fajsúlyát illetően némi kétkedésre adhat okot, anélkül, hogy alaposabban megismerkednénk a sörrel, az az alkoholtartalom, mely a maga 8 százalékával talán nem a legdurvább mérték, amit valaha címkére vetettek, s egy efféle formátumhoz talán nem is a legmegfelelőbb keret, már ha az exkluzivitását adó hordóérlelések rendszerinti velejárójából indulunk ki alkoholfok terén. Mindemellett azt is le kell szögeznünk, hogy ez esetben ""csak"" egy stoutról van szó, s ebbéli tulajdonságánál fogva talán soha nem is lesz annyira tökéletes alany az érleléshez, mint egy vérmesebb imperial stout. Ezen az úton kell tehát elindulnunk feltérképezése során. Küllem tekintetében semmi esetre sem okoz csalódást, olajos teste szemet gyönyörködtető módon folyik ki az üvegből. Az illatok terén a különböző érlelések kavalkádjában tévedhetünk el, talán ez esetben beigazolódni látszik a mondás, miszerint a kevesebb néha több. A különböző alkoholok kusza keverékének képe szövődik ki óvatosan, ha választanom kellene, leginkább a szárazabb, sherrys és tequilás aromák telepszenek rá a kávés illatgörgetegre. Olyan selymes és krémes a test, amennyire csak lehetséges, az ízrobbanás azonban ez esetben elmarad. Nem az a desszertszerű jelleg - letisztult, füstös és pörkölt stílusú a karaktere. Idővel egyre jobban kinyílik, így a bourbon kókuszos, vaníliás aromái is érvényre jutnak illatában is, s ahogy kortyolgatjuk, úgy lesz egyre nagyobb mélysége a kezdetben követhetetlen struktúrának. Zamatos, krémes, sziporkázó alkoholok elegye teljesedik ki idővel, s az utolsó kortyok felé haladva - kissé finomítva álláspontunkat - egyre inkább díjazzuk az értékeit.","HUNGARY","adster"

Pours black with a volcano like beige head, very lively. Thick in the mouth, really quite tangy and fruity, the BA is noticeable and leaves a woody beerprint and light boozy edge over this beer. I am not sure that I would pick out any particular variant of the BA which I guess is intended as the blend does seem to ensure that no one BA takes over another. However all in all I am a bit disappointed Mikkeller make some great beers but this isnt one, £8.95 is quite a lot for a beer that doesnt really do it for me.
