3596,"2016-01-06",3.9,"Enjoyed at the brewpub in St-Jerome a year ago. Pours a cloudy brown-amber colour with a big warm-beige head, nice lasting and full of lacing. Hoppy nose over fruity malts. Tarty mouthfeel with a sharp bitter finish. Mild fruity and grassy flavours. Wow ! What a nice bitter that does not show its low alcohol content. Would of never guessed it !!","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
3596,"2015-10-21",3.9,"On tap at Dieu du Ciel (Zwanze Day 2015). Hazy brown-ish amber with a small beige head and some lacing. Aroma is quite earthy and mineral with some English hops, toasted malts, leafy notes and toffee notes. Taste is much more delicate than aroma and that works quite well too. Mineral and caramel forward, but also quite leafy. Mild bitterness as well as light sweetness. Light to medium body. Medium carbonation. Mineral finish. Easy drinking and quenching. Pretty good Bitter.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
