2077,"2016-10-11",3.5,"12 oz. can pours a hazy orange/brown with small soapy white head that leaves some lacing. Aroma has some floral hops, Belgian yeast, and unknown spiciness.

2077,"2016-08-24",3.5,"Taster at Standard Market, Westmont.Im noting a similarity between these beers and Goose islands Belgian ""sister."" Understandable since Gooses Barrel Room manager is now their brewmaster. So this may be considered close to Gooses Matilda, but it has more obvious brett funk. Light color, a more tart smell, though it seems more like a sour fruit. But the taste is quite zesty. Malts stay light, and the hops keep the overall effect dry.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
2077,"2016-08-20",3.9,"This is a soild saison-ish whatever. Its orange brown, cloudy w/ a big foamy head. Its a little hoppy and herbal and seems to have a nice, fruity and fairly standard Belgian yeast character even though its a fully brett fermentation. Theres a nice, soft floral note around the edges and some bright mandarin orange notes that really seem to meld well w/ the light but creamy texture. Im into it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
2077,"2016-07-26",3.9,"From a can poured in a large snifter. Pours light brown. Aroma is creamy and malty. Flavor is rich and creamy with a touch of tartness and a good yeastiness. Just what I was looking for. Hops are noticeable but not overpowering. One of the best BDGs Ive had.","Illinois, USA","drdisque"
