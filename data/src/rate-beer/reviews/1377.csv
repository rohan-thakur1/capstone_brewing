Smells of whole-grain bread, accompanied by toffee malts and a convincing amount of earth. On the nose, this beer reminds me of an malt beer, while providing more body and revealing more earth than sugar.

Has a very creamy mouthfeel, revealing a vivid carbonation, showcasing a malt driven, earthy beer. Drinks very clean throughout, while malts define the taste at all stages.

Tastes of rustic bread, accompanied by cocoa nibs and a whiff of coca-cola, all wrapped up into the beers profound, earthy maltiness. Turns a tad more into a toffee direction, while the beer remains very silk on the palate, finishing with a bubbly, decent bitterness, adding a nice complexity to the malts.

Convinces by its perfect malt balance, resulting in a very focused beer with a pleasant depth, heading completely into the malt direction.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1377,"2015-07-01",4.3,"Bottle. Probably on of the best Dunkel in the world and one of my favorite beers. The Barock pours dark amber colored and clear with a long lasting full fine-frothy tan head. The aroma that gets into the nose already gives and great impression of the richness and complexity of this beer. The sweet smell comes along with strong notes of honey and sherry, as well as some hints of plum. In the back lays a spicy foundation brought by the hops. While the honey and sherry notes also dominate the flavor and are accompanied by malty sweetness, more and more hoppier notes of spices and herbs also make the Barock more dry and bitter. While the aroma and taste is complex the body is surprisingly light but well structured with medium carbonation. Because of that is mouthfeel is slightly fizzy and crisp and give the Barock a refreshing character. Finally the finish is bitter-dry and leaves a pleasant and long dry aftertaste which keeps the honey and sherry notes. Highly recommended!","GERMANY","bartholos"

-The flavor profile is able to follow through as well. Expertly crafted.
-The soft bubbling makes the palate focus on the malt and hop interplay.
-Drinkability is as high as the pleasure gotten from every sip.

The aroma is sticky sweet, hazel-nutty, very malty and aromatic. 

I was almost concerned with how sweet this one smells, that it might taste a bit over-sweet. It has a lot of malt flavor but not much of that is sticky sweetness. Nutty & bitter all around. Plenty of hazelnut, lightly oaky, lightly sweet. The beer is really strikingly bitter, far more bitter than what I generally associate with a Dunkel, but in such a nice way. The hops are herbaceous and bordering on intrusive without really crossing that line. Id  say this is one enjoyable, rich, and challenging beer.

What impresses me most is that the body is rich and full for a 4.% ABV beer, normally there would be a hole in the palate range but this is spot on, no wateriness or thinness at all.

1377,"2008-03-24",2.7,"Clear garnet. Light beige head quickly settles and disperses. Iron, molasses and grapey aromas preside over mere hints of caramelized malt and dark bread. Prickly effervescence tickles the palate. Opens with an irony twang which eventually succumbs to a bittersweet chocolate- and hazelnut-tinged malt blend. Candied pecan sweetness and barklike astringency trail closely behind. While poorly attenuated, theres quite a bit of airiness which keeps the flabby fruitiness at bay. That said, the malt is heavily obscured by the weighty residuals. Plummy fruitiness and notes of red licorice are omnipresent as the malt begins to take on a creamed coffee accent toward the finish. Dunkel lager must be clean, delicate and focused (bottle conditioned and unfiltered would also be welcomed), and while this is fairly delicate, the insistent fruitiness, prickly carbonation and irony acid mar a potentially pleasurable experience.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

1377,"2007-12-31",3.6,"Optimistic (?) Bottle date of March 2009; Sampled December 2007
Pours with a frothy, initially three-finger thick, amber tinged, tan colored head that sit on top of a blackened, concentrated brown colored brew that shows a brilliantly clear, concentrated garnet color when held up to the light.  Rich malt aromatics greet my nose upon my first smell of the aroma.  Sweet, concentrated / caramelized malt notes, a hint of molasses, touches of chocolate, a substantial toasted note along with hints of lightly burnt toast and browned, crushed soda crackers.  The rich malt aromatics almost take on a butterscotch like note as the beer warms up.

Quite light feeling up front, but it picks up some light heft towards the middle and finish.  Still this is a very quaffable brew.  Malt focused with darker grain flavors of caramelized malt sugar, sweet malt, touches of toasted / almost roasted malt and a really pronounced, browned, soda cracker note in the finish.  The finish has a light bitterness that couples with an almost raisin like malt sweetness and a slightly dusty malt character.  As the beer warms it picks up a slight herbal note that couples with the light hop bitterness in the finish.

This should really appeal to the malt lovers out there, despite being relatively low in alcohol it has a full, rich, textured malt character to it.  Plus it is very light and easy drinking.

1377,"2006-01-17",3.7,"Only 4 mths old 500mL surprisingly enough. Lasting foamy beige mousse covers a chestnut body with orange reflects, blooming with carbonation. First sip keeps the goodness from the aroma on, with gentle fruit acids enhancing drinkability while elegant alt-like leafy noble hops and nutty dryish malts escape anything close to heavy sweetness. As the sipping continues, you figure youd rather keep on with heavy sips and the notion applied rewards you with delightful lacing coating the glass. The carbonation slows down as it warms, diminishing the roasty feel and accentuating the competence of the fruitiness construction - grape, plums, berries . Finishes smooth, tongue-cleansing. Light-medium body doesnt show any wateriness, but definitely feels lagery in its leanness. Very enjoyable, well extracted malts that stretch more toward roastiness and bready toastiness than sweet caramel and bring forth deep, almost vinous pleasurable fruit notes.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1377,"2005-11-11",3.5,"(500 ml bottle: $2.29 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) This cant be right.  I just bought this bottle recently, and I see the date on the bottle is 11-Feb-2001.  Wow, it sure seems like dunkels handle aging extremely well because this is another example of a beer that is supposedly well past its prime that still tastes great.  Well, maybe its not a great tasting beer, but its solid enough and doesnt seem negatively impacted by the age.  It has that familiar and very welcomed dark, toasty, slightly chocolaty maltiness that seems common in German dunkels.  This one seems slightly sweeter than the others Ive tried, but that doesnt make it less enjoyable.  Light bitterness tags along for the ride nearly unnoticed.  Oddly enough, despite being quite flavorful, this isnt a very aromatic beer, showing only a modest amount of toasty and earthy maltiness.  This gently carbonated beer has a medium body.  Medium brown in color and quite clear in appearance, the crown is light tan, creamy and well over an inch in height on the pour.  As it slowly settles to a thin, complete layer, it leaves only a few small patches of lace on the glass.  Well, this is the last of the nine Weltenburger beers Ive sampled that is imported into the U.S., and I think Ive saved one of the best for last.  A solid dunkel packing lots of flavor and enjoyment.  Although the age may have something to do with that as it seems to me that with dunkels, aging intensifies the malt flavors.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

1377,"2002-07-12",3.4,"Dark and fairly thick. I must admit I dont see why others are calling it thin.  Flavor was the closest thing I have come across in a beer that compares to chewing on roasted barley.  Fairly sweet with caramel present.  No discernable hop presence.  Quite fine.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

1377,"2002-06-15",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2003 It blew away the other Munich Dunkels I tasted because it's mild, not bitter and appropriately complex.  It's a bit bock-ish and sweet.  Quite good, but unusual for its style.  There's a slight roastiness present.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
