Thanks, Jay!

Was lucky enough to receive this as part of a 10-beer package sent by Jay. Had heard great things about this one. Really looking forward to trying a good Hefe.

Poured a light yellow semi-hazy color with one finger of fizzy gray head, which thinned out immediately. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Decent lacing. Average retention. (Sight - 3.50)

Smelled a nice whiff of Hefeweizen notes, including banana bread, dried banana chips, cloves, Circus Peanuts candy, Juicy Fruit, lemon zest and hints of coriander. Very juicy on the nose for a Hefe. (Smell - 4.50)

Taste followed the nose, although not quite as good overall. Got banana bread, sugary Circus Peanuts candy, honey, Juicy Fruit, lemon zest, coriander, hints of tangerine, peppery spices that I really didnt get in the nose, pears and a touch of green apple. (Taste - 4.25)

Light body. Oily texture. Lively carbonation. Long, juicy finish. (Feel - 4.50)

Wow, very good. Probably my second-favorite Hefeweizen, only trailing Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier. (Overall - 4.50)

1685,"2016-07-31",4.2,"64 oz. growler fill, served in my trusty (unlike some Texans- HA!) Green Bay Packers Weizen glass- poured a slightly murky yellow color, huge 3 finger head formed but quickly disappeared to nothingness. Aroma of cloves, bananas, wheat, and straight up good beer. Hits the mouth with a light body, wheat can be sensed with very strong sensations of clove dominating from start to finish, banana comes in the middle (think just off green) but lasts until the finish. End has a lingering clove/yeast/wheat aftertaste, which for what it is, is very pleasant. Dont know why I saved to rate this one... well, I do, its because I wanted it to be the last beer I had in Texas. Tommorrow is never given, and I sure in the hell aint saving it for the prom, so might as well have it! Plus since its very hard to find lately for a growler fill (thanks for NOTHING Flix Brewhouse and Growler Bar!), might as well go to my Ace in the whole and just wait for 6 weeks to get it!

A: Pours a perfect hazy golden color with a little amber mixed into the body.  A thick and fluffy pure white head forms on the pour and it recedes slowly to a thin film.  Soapy lace is left down the glass.

S:  Great hefe smells.  Cracked wheat, some banana with clove and other great phenolic yeast sweetness.  There is a nice citrus hop profile in the background as well.  As it warms a touch of bubblegum starts to come out of the nose.

T:  Nice fruity yeast flavors with a little clove.  Some minimal citrus hops with a nice strong wheat backbone.  There is a stronger flash of bubblegum-like yeast in the taste than the nose.  The flavors mesh incredibly well and it just tastes great.

M:  Medium to light bodied with a little bit of yeasty heft to it.  The carbonation is just a little low, but it didnt lose much in the growler.

It will make you want more.  I finished the whole growler in one sitting.  Amazing.  Wait were not done yet.  A lot of Hefes are lacking in the mouthfeel section but not here.

S: Upon cracking open the growler I got a huge blast of banana. Could smell it from arms length. Upon pouring wheat, light clove, and crisp lemony zest came through. Very inviting.

T: Like the nose this has four key elements going strong... banana, wheat, lemon, and clove. About half-way through the second glass I started to get a little bubble gum.

M: Simply exceptional. One of my complaints about hefes, is from time to time they dont have as much body as Id like them to have. Sure they are refreshing, but a little bit more weight can be a great thing. The live oak hefe is a perfect example of this. Nice, solidly medium bodied. Even carbonation throughout. Refreshing finish.

The smell is mostly banana with some sweet smelling wheat malt.

The flavor is lighter and more subtle than most American hefeweizens, and I like that. It has again a thick wheat character. The banana returns in the flavor along with a nice dash of clove.

The mouthfeel is the only thing I think could be improved here and it very well may just be that I am having it from a growler.

The wheat in this one give is a unique flavor but it is proabbly the best American Hefeweizen out there and better than a lot of the neutered imported German Weissbiers.

Poured from a growler into a wheat beer glass. I was nervous about the growler but when I cranked the top I heard the tell tale ""HISS"" of carbon escaping and a weight was lifted off my shoulders. Beer is dark yellow and completely opaque, huge haze to it. It forms an aggressive and full head of small to medium bubbles that leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Carbonation is steady and moderate. This beer looks beautiful.

The aroma is in your face with this beer. Its not quite like a wheat wine but it pushes that boundary for sure. Strong banana and cloves. Completely fills my face with this aroma. I could smell it from a couple of feet away. It is SO good.

Wonderful flavor as well. First, this is the most drinkable beer Ive ever had. Greater than 5 IMO. Medium body, slightly more body than I was expecting, but its still wonderful. Some good sweetness up front and a lot of good flavor in the back with a nice wheaty feeling to it. Great ester characters throughout the palate and beer. Gets better the more you drink. Just spectacular. The carbonation give the beer a slight sourness that helps connectivitiy. This is seriously one of the best BEERS I have ever had.

This is seriously one of my favorite beers. I should look into getting a keg of this because I would make it my daily drinker. Its a cruel set of circumstances that I am in DC and this beer is in Austin. I have an outstanding ISO Live Oak Hefeweizen out from now on.

5.0 S: Wow, really wonderful. Tons of bubblegum and clove with banana oil undertones. Appropriate level of yeastiness and a neutral wheat flavor. Pretty much perfect proportions of the major components with a lot of power behind it. Elegant, bold and robust, this is about as good as it gets.

4.0 T: The taste is also very good, but only about one tenth as powerful as the nose. Bubblegum and clove are once again my most powerful with banana second chair again. Surprisingly dry. Neutral wheat. No-off flavors and well brewed, but the taste could use a good three of four fold amplification.

3.0 M: The mouthfeel is a good deal disappointing. Medium body, but lacking the creaminess that the best hefes have to offer. Also, theres plenty of carbonation, but is fails to liven up the mouthfeel. Instead of spritzy, its a ""dead"" carbonation.

3.5 D: Absolutely amazing nose, pretty good taste, and otherwise sub-par. Still, Id have no problem drinking this on a regular basis. A couple glasses today did the trick and a couple more tomorrow.

Let me just get this out of the way early:  This is EASILY the best HefeWeizen Ive ever had.

Now on to the review...

Appearance was outstanding - mysteriously murky & cloudy golden straw color (leaning a bit towards orange).  Dense layer of foamy white head that left a spotty ring of lacing around the glass.

Aroma was great - some banana and wheat - just as youd expect, but with a great deal of nuance.

Flavor was spectacular - more of the banana and smooth wheat, but also a soft, tangy twinge of sweet citrus came through that put this one into another stratosphere for me... gone was the bite you sometimes get from a hefe - this is just extremely well balanced and super smooth.

Carbonation is there (as evidenced by the nice layer of head I got on my pour), but the mouthfeel is amazingly silky.  Again - another outstanding quality of this beer.

The aroma is a mouthwatering blend of bananas and clove. Its a sweet smell, chock full of yeast and wheat notes. It tends more toward the banana/bubblegum side of things than the spice, but the spice is definitely present. It smells like the batter of a spiced banana bread. There are some light lemony aromas floating around, as well. Just sublime.  The flavor is moderately sweet, a bit drier than some, though. The yeast did just the right amount of work on this beer. Its a bit lighter than other hefeweizens that Ive tried, but it works for the beer.  The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Lots of gentle little bubbles, even from a growler. Its incredibly drinkable. One of the best session beers that Ive ever tried.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
1685,"2010-05-10",4.1,"Really interesting - it has the light banana and clove of a classic hefe, but with a very distinct vanilla note that add another layer of complexity.  Just lightly tart with a very creamy mouthfeel.  Superb.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"

1685,"2010-04-26",3.8,"Had my parents fill a growler on their trip to Austin.

A- Body is a light cloudy pale yellow hue. Pours with a large 2-3 finger foamy white head. Head eventually fades to about one finger and has great retention from there. Some lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- Nose is very good-and in line for a hefe. Soft cloves and a hint of banana come through as well as a hint of breadiness.

T- The flavor is soft and balanced all around. A presence of clove and the slightest hint of banana with a nice bready yeast backbone. The finish adds just a touch of hops and gets a little biscuty.

P- High tingly carbonation and yeasty body. The carbonation is somewhat seltzer-like. Body is nice but could be fuller and smoother.

O- This is a nice, mellow, balanced hefe. Reminds me a lot of Weihenstephaner-but doesnt do the trick as well for me. A good drinkable, sessionable beer that I would be ordering a lot if I lived in TX...but I dont think I will go out of my way to have it again here. We have local hefes that are just as nice. Still a great opportunity to try!

1685,"2009-04-05",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2009 12oz handbottle courtesy of a very generous BA, opened 4-5-09

Pours a very hazy golden yellow with a short-lived one inch white head that recedes to nothing fairly quickly and leaves no lacing.

The aroma is much citrusy than I expected with a big dose of tart lemon aromas and even a hint of funk.  The typical wheat presence of bananas and bubble gum sweetness are definitely present but take a bit of a back seat.  Very unique nose for the style.

The taste is even more tart than the aroma with a huge lemon zing up front that hardly allows the sweetness of the wheat to come through at all.  The finish is dry and acidic with more than a hint of funk lingering in the aftertaste.

The mouthfeel is a little slick with low carbonation, likely due to this being from a handbottle.

This is one of the more unique hefes Ive had and while I do like it, I really think there is a bit too much tartness and funk for this to be a world-class version of the style.  Maybe it was the handbottling, but I was a little underwhelmed.

EDIT 5-8-09: Poured from a growler and it became very clear that the bottle was, in fact, off. There was none of the off-putting tartness from the hand bottle and the aroma and taste were almost perfect representations of the style - a great balance between light lemony citrus, fresh bananas and spices.

1685,"2009-03-04",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2011 Found on tap @ Freetails. Cloudy light orange pour. Standard hefe smell. Taste is rich in wheat grains. Tasty, clean finish. 4.0
RE-RATE 2/26/11 Tap at Gman FW. It pours a very cloudy/hazy light gold color with a foamy white head. The slice of lemon accentuates this appearance.

The aroma is of dry grain, sweet fruit which is a mix of banana, citrus and lemon. There is a fair bit of yeast in this as well.

The flavor is also bready sweet with a big taste of banana and other fruit. There is a slight sense of spicyness like coriander but only in the slightest.

Adding the lemon provides a lovely citrus tart that is also balanced with the flavor of candy cigarettes. You know those kind you used to get from the ice cream man as a kid that blew smoke? And when you heard the ice cream truck coming you would tear through the house like a madman looking for a freaken dollar? I swear, wanna teach a kid a sense of urgency? Send the ice cream man by. But then you ended up puffing the candy cigarette, and you know they only have 1 good puff in them, so if your friends werent watching when you did it you flipped out?

1685,"2009-01-19",3.8,"Growler, courtesy GodOfThunder.  The pour yields a very cloudy, glowing, tangerine orange body.  A small, foamy, off-white head settles to a wispy film with a bubbly edge.  Minimal, spotty lacing marks the glass.  The nose features overly ripe bananas prominently, with a substantial creaminess imparting a milkshake like aroma.  Further scents include candied lemon and orange rinds, browned apples, and spicy clove and nutmeg.  Flavors show more of the same, a faint wheat malt base fading into sweet, mushy bananas and cream, with more candied citrus, nutmeg and clove.  Floral hops lend balancing bitterness, but this one is all about the fruit and spice content.  Relatively light in body, with lively carbonation, a more substantial palate might solidify this as the best Hefewizen Ive ever had.  While it doesnt quite achieve that status for me, it is certainly an outstanding example of the genre.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

1685,"2008-06-21",4.0,"22 oz from a keg. Smells like a dopplebock. Light yellow with sulphur in the nose. Plenty of vanilla with some clove but very light, peppery (also very subtle). Merangue flavor like lemon are also there. Solid brew.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
1685,"2008-06-19",4.3,"A softish pour produces an almost one finger thick, pale, tan tinged head that sits on top of a deeply hazy, straw colored beer.  When held up directly to the light it picks up some orange tints, but is still completely opaque.  The aroma is quite hearty, lots of yeast notes from, surprise - surprise, actual yeast as well as ample clove notes, a hint of banana and lots of wheat / grain aromas.  This last supplies some wheat-tartness, aromas of crushed saltine crackers and a rich, chewy, crushed grain aroma.  The tartness accentuates a touch of fruitiness reminiscent of something like a cross between a pear and tropical fruit.  This is just very hearty smelling for a HefeWeizen & quite enjoyable, the depth of the grain character is quite nice.

Not as thick as I was expecting based on the rich aromas, instead it has a nice light texture & heft to it like a good HefeWeizen should.  I was half expecting / dreading that this was going to be overly under-attenuated, I am quite happy it is not.  Perceived sweet notes linger on the palate with a mix of clove and banana notes.  Soft and creamy, yet with a prickly carbonation, this beer has a certain viscousness to it that coats the palate, but does not keep this from being light and quaffable.  Lightly tart, which accentuates a very soft fruitiness, but mostly plays up the chewy wheat flavors.  This has lots of grain character to it; chewy, slightly dried-grass like, a bit of hay, a full wheat grain flavor and a crushed cracker note.  The finish has a mix of clove flavors, light hop bitterness and a slight, herbal hop flavor.

As the beer warms a bit the banana flavors become a bit more accented & this accentuates an up front, grain sweetness.  This is eminently quaffable; there is just enough sweetness to accentuate some soft fruit, clove and grain character.  Really it is the fresh grain character that makes this beer so tasty; I cant remember having a HefeWeizen that tasted fresher and the vibrant grain character is what is driving this vibrancy.  This only gets tastier and more well balanced as it warms up.  I am towards the end of my 22oz serving and am finding myself wishing for more; the banana is definitely much more noticeable than the clove that was more noticed at the cooler temps, but it is still not overly much.  This is a damn tasty HefeWeizen, a style that I have forgotten how good it can actually be if done correctly; this is certainly one of the finest examples that I have had, my guess is that they use a Decoction mash; there is almost no better way to get such a vibrant grain character into a beer.  Fantastic!","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

1685,"2007-12-15",4.3,"Thanks to geuzelover for the growler. Served in my 20oz New Glarus Weizen Glass. Gotta love the right glassware for a beer. I read the BJCP style guidelines for this beer right before the review so Id be on the correct page.

A: Dark straw body. It is very opaque. There was a bit of a white head initially, around a quarter inch, but it fell quickly. Ill blame that on it being a growler. Carbonation is visible.

S: Clove and banana are very dominant in the aroma with some lemon and wheat rounding out the bouquet. The clove is really strong and it almost has a slight smoky character but I think thats just my mind trying to interpret the cloves.

T: The wheat was more subdued in the aroma, but its right up front in the flavor. Likewise, the powerful clove presence isnt nearly as strong in the flavor but provides a little spice to the beer and comes on a bit stronger in the aftertaste. The banana is there as well but less in the flavor than in the aftertaste which has a strong banana character. All the flavors blend nicely to create a very smooth beer.

M: The amount of carbonation is pretty surprising for a growler. It works great for the style which should be pretty highly carbonated. Tastes pretty full bodied in the beginning and middle of the taste, but as it leads to the aftertaste the body seems lighter and finishes perfectly.

D: Damn fine hefe all around. Especially considering it was from a growler.","Troy, New York, USA","drseamus"

Its pretty smooth, but that dry fizzyness develops on the backend. Finish is smooth, light malty wheat with that little bit of sourness you get with all Live Oak beers, probably due to their horizontal mash tanks.

Balance is what earns this brew a near-perfect score.  Ive had fresh hefeweizens with strong fruit and clove elements but this beer is so delicately made so as flavors come together in a symphony instead of individual components.

1685,"2005-10-10",3.8,"09.30.05  GABF  An almost syrupy appearance, this stuff is thick, opaque, and generally attractive beneath a thick white head.  Luscious aromas of wheaty fruits, peaches, lemongrass, and touches of spice.  Mouthfeel is light and effy, despite its thick appearance, but its plenty coating and theres a crispness about it that pleases.  This would be nice with pub fare.  Pretty sweet, but with enough background and finishing tart acidity to keep you coming back.  Not at all cloying.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
1685,"2005-10-06",3.8,"Sweet and perfumy throughout the nose. Very fresh, fruity and full on the senses. Nose of bananas, pears, fruit cocktail, and some hearty wheat. Smooth aqnd rich, sticky and coating the mouth with a sweet, husky wheat and rye flavor. Sweet and hearty is the key here, making this one a very good hefeweizen indeed, even though its too much on the sweet side.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

The taste start with a nice fresh weizen character with lots of fruity elements and subdued spice and wheat for depth. The palate is crisp and lively, very refreshing bier.

1685,"2005-10-05",4.2,"Tap at Ginger Man Austin.  Thick creamy white head on a pale golden body.  Aroma is very yeasty and has loads of bananas and tropical fruit.  Taste was of sharp wheat, citrus, typical hefe flavors.  These typical hefe flavors are so well done and come across on a smooth mouthfeel.

1685,"2005-09-07",4.4,"Sampled on draft, Ginger Man, Dallas. Ive heard a fair amount of criticism of American-made hefes. Live Oak Hefeweizen will make a skeptic believe that American breweries can nail this style. Cloudy, tarnished gold in appearance with a scattered white head. Aroma is clean with some lemon and notes of banana. Banana, clove, pepper, vanilla/bubblegum are found amid the tart wheat flavor. Very complex, sophisticated & understated. Medium-bodied, moderately carbonated and creamy-smooth. Balanced with a clean finish. A MUST try. Im not certain what the brewer could do to make this beer any better.","SE, Oklahoma, USA","Cable"
1685,"2005-07-23",4.3,"On draught at Lovejoys in Austin.  This beer is delicious!  LO has just about perfected this one as it has just the right amount of banana, clove, sweetness, and finish that you want in a Hefe.  It is so comforting to see this beer in so many bars & restaurants in Austin now so that you can have an easy-drinkin LO Hefe with your meal.  We are very lucky to have this beer in town.  Excellent beer.","Austin, Texas, USA","DewBrewer"

The aroma is a sweet mixture of wheat and hops, with an ever-so-slight malt presence in the background.  This is a classic Hefe, as close to a quality German as one is likely to find in der United States, with a few other exceptions.  A nice, sweet and sour brew that doesnt require a lemon to bring out its full character.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
1685,"2005-04-09",3.0,"so i was at the gman sipping on a devils backbone and taking notes and b.sing with the barman and saw that this was on tap also so i was thinking of having it when i finished my current beer. a lady walks in with some guy and asks for a wheat beer that isnt too sweet. and the guy behind the bar goes through his mantra of wheat beers, but doesnt mention this one, so i inject myself into their discussion and mention the live oak, he responds that he forgot they recieved that one and the lady states she would like to try it, so he pours her a small taste, she smiles and says she will take a pint, i think,alright, this could be a good one when i finish my devil. so the barman and i discuss the hefe, he says he finds it too yeasty but enjoyable, i scoff and think to myself that this man must be inexperienced with hefeweizens i was wrong.;
pours cloudy like grapefruit juice that contains a lot of pulp with a popping white head. this is the murkiest hefe i have encountered. raw yeast aroma like a starter for a homebrew that dominates with a weird urinal aspect and a slight roast banana hint. wow this was murky like a creek in east texas where all the clay in the soil gets agitated in the rain, just thick with yeasty goodness. strong flavor that i expected to be sweet,  before i heard the young lady say she enjoyed it, but was not sweet to the extent many hefes tend to be. very grassy and has a fresh green bean taste. reminds me of the fresh veggies that my family used to grow out in the country when i was a kid and we would eat them the same day they were picked and they would sometimes still have this dirty taste to them. there is some light banana in the finish.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
1685,"2005-04-01",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2007 Gingerman - Dallas. Finally, a hefe that I can detect bubblegum from. Ive always  thought other raters were just making that up. Big creamy head. Lots of banana flavors. Delicious. The whole pint was gone in a matter of a few minutes. I cant wait to have another tomorrow.","Dallas, Texas, USA","Tejas"
1685,"2005-03-21",3.9,"Had on tap at the Ginger Man in Austin, Tx.Found this to be an excellent wheat. Nice, thick pour with an everpresent pure white head with heavy lacing. Yeasty aroma of bananas and flowers. Detect bananas in the flavor as well with a bit of bubblegum in the aftertaste. Nice light orange cloudy appearance. Sort of like a banana and bubblegum milkshake. Very refreshing - I could envision quaffing down several of these at the beach. Probably one of the best domestic wheats I have had yet.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
1685,"2005-03-14",3.8,"Yeasty, fruity and somewhat sulphurous aroma.  Medium sweetness.   Lightly tart, a yeast assault and not very bitter.  Super hazy, almost opaque.  Ive seen primary fermentations that were clearer.  Banana really kicks in in the finish, like a banana beer smoothie.  Balanced, drinkable, impressive.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"
1685,"2004-10-13",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 22, 2005 Rerate on tap at Gingerman on 8/21/05: Cloudy golden with a frothy white head.  Aroma is nicely yeasty and malty with good black pepper and banana citrus spice.  Smooth, tasty, citrusy, malty, yeasty and very nicely balanced.  An authentic and very enjoyable hefeweizen.

GABF 2004: Hazy golden color with a frothy white head.  Wonderfully authentic sweet malted wheat and bready German yeasty aroma.  Body is mildly bready and sweet throughout, but thins toward the finish and has a touch too much citric acidity.  Still a very nice German hefeweizen, quite well balanced, and very drinkable.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

1685,"2002-07-13",3.1,"RE-RATE:  Had some of this very fresh out of a keg at a friends wedding party.  Theyre cool enough to try for some decent micro beer at their wedding party!  Actually it was supposed to be Paulaner hefe but the keg place screwed up.  Anyway, I didnt get the bubblegum flavor and its definitely a passable hefe.  Perhaps a little too thick on the sweetness.  Standard banana-clove-yeastiness.  ORIGINAL RATING 4/22/02: Decent, slightly sour smell, but what is it with microbrew hefes that taste like bubblegum?  This is like the third one that Ive had.  It wasnt just in the finish like legion242 said, in the glass I had it was there the whole time.  Yuck.
