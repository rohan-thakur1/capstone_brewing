951,"2017-01-04",3.6,"Tap. Pours crystal clear Amber orange, small beige head, decent lacing. Aroma is Citrus, oranges, caramel, bread. Flavor is light sweet, very light bitter, nice citrus punch over a caramel and biscuit malt backbone. Medium body. Clean and simple. Well crafted.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
951,"2016-12-25",3.3,"12oz can large frothy head with golden body moderate lacing smells and taste of hops and light citrus","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","Ronritter"
951,"2016-11-14",3.3,"Copper color with a larger beige head. Malt and grain dominate the nose. Hints of citrus, mostly orange and orange zest, fill in behind the malt. Lightly sweet start. A grainy and generic bitterness in the middle. Interesting as I bought this, thinking it was an IPA and even shared one as such. A modern version of a California common.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
951,"2016-11-08",3.2,"Can gifted from Andy. Nice story. Decent beer. Citrus and fruit notes and a slight hoppy taste.","Minnesota, USA","wilnatp"
951,"2016-10-27",3.6,"Minnesota Trip Beer #194. Keg at the brewery, 5/12/16. Clear red, large foamy tan head, good retention. Aroma of toasted malt and mild tropical fruit. The taste is toasted malts, caramel, tropical fruit. Medium bodied, well balanced.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
951,"2016-10-15",3.4,"Can. Pale copper in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas are of bready malts, tangelo, and minerals. Flavors are of semi-sweet grainy malts, grassy and sweet citrus-like hops, and white pepper. More bitter than Ive encountered with this style previously, but its not over the top by any means. A solid beer, especially considering its a style that doesnt get much love.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
951,"2016-08-10",3.5,"Shaker pint draft at the Mission Restaurant and Bar in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The pour is a clear copper with a small off white head. The aroma is fresh grain malt, grass and general bread malt. The taste is classic California Common flavors with the grassy earthy hops, the softly sweet bread malts and a clean finish. The palate is light to medium bodied, active carbonation and the clean grassy mineral finish. Tasty, great take on the style.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
951,"2016-07-12",3.1,"Grainy malt forward nose and flavor but with more of a hop bite than expected, and a crisp finish, which takes it from boring to ok. Can.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
951,"2016-02-29",3.0,"Can from bradley...thx man...not much to nose...slight hops a little malt and mostly grain aromas...mouth is basically the same...needs a little more flavor for me to really like...good summer and boating brew.","Minnesota, USA","johnnymusky"
951,"2015-11-28",3.5,"Can. Pours a clear copper body under a small fizzy white head. The nose is very lightly hoppy with some slightly grainy and husky maltiness. The flavor is pretty hoppy for what the aroma let on. Its still slightly husky and grainy, but works pretty well for the style. Lighter bodied and fizzy with a lightly bitter lingering finish mixed with husky grain. Pretty good Cali Common.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
951,"2015-09-08",3.5,"On tap at the Nook. Pours dark amber with a good looking head that lasts. Aroma is malty with good grain faint florals. Taste is smooth crisp malt and balanced hops with gentle bitterness.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
951,"2015-08-30",3.2,"I like the concept but dont think it really works here. Not bad just something off in the aftertaste.","Minneapolis, ","Obfuscate"

951,"2015-05-11",2.9,"Somewhat dull beer. I didnt know it would be a California Common, exactly; I interpreted the name to mean that it was going to be a well hopped version of a lager style, but it turns out not to be that distinctive in the scheme of things. A little fruitiness, but subdued overall. (on tap at brewery)","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
951,"2015-05-06",3.2,"Sampled at Northgate Liquors MN beer tasting. Light and bitter for the style. OK. Slammable.","Minnesota, USA","Ericular"
951,"2015-04-18",3.4,"On tap at the brewery. Pour is clear golden with a small white head and sticky lacing. Grainy, biscuit, some grassy notes, doughy, light lemon, and chalky aroma. Taste is grassy, noble hoppy, biscuit, dough, some chalkiness, and lemon with a crispy finish. Medium body with high carbonation. Not bad.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
951,"2014-12-22",3.1,"Not much on the aroma...kind of smells like a light beer. Color is light golden as expected, and you taste wheat/grain with a bit of a bitter finish. Not my favorite, but probably better in the summer when its hot and you can put a few back playing some lawn games :)","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","falco242"
951,"2014-12-22",3.4,"interesting take on this lager hybrid. good but my least favorite from the initial lineup tried at the brewery","Minnesota, USA","mnmike"
951,"2014-12-17",3.0,"12oz can pours a clear pale golden/orange with a medium khaki head. Aroma is sweet caramel malt and not ripe grapefruit. Oh its pretty sweet, grapefruit citrus, more sweetness from malt, some dry grass bittering hops in there, and lager yeast. Just to sweet, the yeast and hops used just dont really work with all the sweetness.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
951,"2014-11-19",3.2,"Can. Pours a clear gold with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a good amount of earthy grains with a bit of hay and backing grass as well as a hint of biscuit. Flavor has lots of grains and hay with a growing biscuit note through the finish and just a hint of citrus.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
951,"2014-11-15",3.0,"Keg @ Brauhaus. Hazy light amber with a small head. Nose is melon and junk white bread. Taste of grain, loads of grain. Light grass. One -dimensional but not bad.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
951,"2014-10-23",3.5,"On tap @ the brewery. Pours a bit hazy golden orange appearance with a cream colored head. Light pine, grapefruit/orange citrus, spicy herbal hoppy aroma. Medium body. Slight candy taste with a fair amount of citrus and new world hops. Light caramel. Pretty easy to drink. Fine.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
951,"2014-10-18",3.5,"Copper color with a medium head. Aroma of hay, grass, wheat and some fruit. Very wheat-heavy flavor. A bit of candied cherry sweetness and some orange, but finishes dry. Very full carbonation.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
951,"2014-10-02",3.0,"Pour on tap at Beer Dabbler, silghtly hazy yellow pour with white head, aroma brought notes of grass, bread, some slight orange with a hint of spicy note, some piney notes as well. Taste is a mix of grass, pine, some orange into bread, biscuit, some earthy tones, finishing fairly dry, slightly bitter.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
951,"2014-09-26",2.9,"Summer Beer Dabbler 2014. From a keg. Light hops. think palate and a dry hop finish. Orange color.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
951,"2014-09-23",3.2,"Pours a cloudy golden yellow, with thickish head. Aroma is very grassy and so is the flavor. Lots of grass, with just a bit of underlying fruitness. So far, the best thing Bauhaus has going for them is the graphic design on their cans.","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"
951,"2014-08-29",3.3,"Tap at the brewery/tap room. Darker orange color. Not heavily hopped. Almost emphasizes sweet over hop like a double IPA. Finish is pleasant and leaves a little hop resin in the palette. Not the most unique tasting West Coast IPA but a decent effort.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"
951,"2014-08-24",2.9,"Tap at Minnesota State Fair, Land of 10,000 Beers section. Light overripe fruit nose, with raisins and dates. Copper color. Gentle fruit sourness, sweet ripe peaches, light pleasatn bitterness. Thin body. Nice enough, but not really so close to style.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
951,"2014-08-15",3.2,"Tap at Bauhaus. Pours a nice dark orange/amber with decent head. Aroma is floral and grassy, lots of graininess to it. Taste is light with some graininess to it. Not bad, not really sure what I was expecting. Drinkable though.t","Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","TheHOFF43"
951,"2014-08-03",3.4,"Sampled on draught at the Bauhaus Brew Labs in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Pours a semi-hazy golden dark amber colored brew with an average sized off-white head that slowly disappears and leaves behind some spotty lacing. Aroma of both floral and grassy hops, golden grain malt and a touch of fruit. Taste is light to medium bodied, with a touch more malt than hops giving this a more Vienna style lager. Finish is semi-sweet, with both a light lager yeast and multi-grain malt aftertaste.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
951,"2014-07-26",3.0,"Bright orange and very slightly hazy. Lilac, orange, and light cereal grain in the nose. A mild, floral spiciness reminiscent of caraway, but I cant place it. As a steam beer will, it tends to hide its qualities.
Juicy and dank hop flavors rattle against a brittle body of rough grains. It is flavorful enough, with grapefruit rind, wood and dry weed, but there is a sure prevalence of husks and acerbic tea that is too persistent.
The body is medium with high carbonation. Raspberry and grainy malt finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
951,"2014-07-24",3.4,"4 or 5 oz. pour as part of a three-beer flight, on tap at the brewerys taproom. Consumed on 7-23-14. Pours a hazy, effervescent orange with beige head. Produces good lacing. Looks very cool. Scents of citrus (especially orange), pine, cream, and armpit. Hoppy aroma. Dry taste features flavors of pine, orange, and sweet buttered biscuit from the malts and yeast. Soft in the palate. Light body. Underwhelming palate should be crisper but not bad. Some liveliness.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
951,"2014-07-18",2.6,"Tap at tap room. Light hazy orange with very small white head. Very little aroma. Yeasty citrus funk with some slight sourness and a light bitterness. A bit of a spice hit but not very full and round in body. Flavor could have used more depth. Finish isnt great. My first beer from these guys on opening night.","Minnesota, USA","commonshawn"
951,"2014-07-18",3.6,"Tap at the taproom. Another style reinventing effort by these guys. Plays more like a citrusy session IPA. Yummy.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
