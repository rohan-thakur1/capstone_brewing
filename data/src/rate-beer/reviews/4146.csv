4146,"2017-05-02",4.2,"(On tap @ CBC 2016 Red Session, Copenhagen) Pours clear medium red with no head, already looks rather like a red wine. Nose is dominated by the fusion of sweet honey, lightly floral, with the notes produced by the red grapes used  mixes of red berries, a touch herbal, light tannin, a little darker berry jam. Very very vinous. Supporting notes of oak and light vanilla. Flavour is matching  like a red dessert wine, sweet honeyed red grapes and added notes of red currant, strawberry, vanilla, oak, light florals, a bit tart to match the sweetness. Sweet aftertaste with a light tannic drying quality. Medium body, flat, a little oily. Bloody lovely grape character here, dangerously drinkable dessert wine alternative!","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"
