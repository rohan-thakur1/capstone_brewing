751,"2017-06-11",4.2,"Kentucky is bourbon country, and this beer surely wont change any hearts and minds on that subject, but theres always a chance. Somehow, Kentucky Ryed Chiquen manages to capture lots of whiskey character while still drinking like a beer. Caramel brown color. Spicy rye and oak on the nose. Flavor has boozy sweetness - like charred sugar and butterscotch - and a very mellow oaky note. For all the whiskey taste, this goes down with smoothness and just a touch of pleasant heat. In typical AtG fashion, this brew comes off as a joke but drinks like something made with a lot of care and thought.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

3.75 A: Mildly hazed rose/light amber color. Two fingers of creamy beige head. Retention is pretty good and a short ring of lacing is left.

3.75 S: Hmm, this is interesting. To start, the rye malt isnt nearly as strong as I was expecting. A lot of rye beers Ive had would mop the floor with this one. That said, theres TONS of rye whiskey aroma. Its tangy, earthy, and boozy. Less of the spicy earthiness that comes with rye malt. Still its a very nice nose. Light caramel and toasty notes.

3.5 T: The taste is like the nose, but calmer. Less boozy than the nose suggests - indeed its pretty much undetectable. Tangy, earthy, leather rye whiskey. Spicy earthiness, caramel, toastiness, light non-sweet toffee.

3.5 M: Medium to heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Super smooth with a light warming finish, but lacking creaminess.

3.5 D: Pretty good beer. Not great, but well balanced with easy drinkability.

Ambrée, col blanc cassé épais.
Arôme offre de suite de très belles effluves de Bourbon sur un boisé subtil.
Le houblon est caché apportant très peu en terme de caractère olfactif. 
Palais de barrique, super, douceur vanillée résiduelle, pointe amer de houblons sur un fini primant sur la douceur. Caramel léger avec un ajout seigle donnant qcq notes épicées. Amertume reste en retrait par rapport à une bière qui prime tout de même sur le Bourbon.

Au final, une très belle bière, malheureusement servie bcp trop froide (mais bon cest Délirium, faut pas trop demander). Une fois à t° ambiante, le profil et le caractère souvrent, mettant à profit toute la complexité du BA.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

Actually, quite clear & bright, with a copper color, off white head that diminished to a bubbly ring & light film, and spots of clingy lacing. The aroma was a little nondescript, with whiskey & light barrel presence, a touch of spiciness, and some almond extract. Medium bodied, with soft carbonation, as some light esters joined the aroma notes, the alcohol showed a little warmth, and there was a pleasant dryness to the finish.

751,"2013-09-02",4.1,"On tap at the GTMW 2013

Another winning release from the masters at Against the Grain this one is so popular that it still is being sold at the brewpub. The right balance of barrel aging and base beer has created a deceptively drinkable masterpiece.

Aroma / Appearance - A rich creamy base looks as thick and dense as it should be from the description. Rye, malt, and oak strike the senses but the booziness, while evident, is never over the top.

Flavor / Palate - Rye and oak warm the palate after just a single sip. A chewy mouthfeel then starts to carry its payload to a bitter warm finish. Sticky as if drinking melted cheese it hangs in the throat. This is a top notch barrel aged project and worth trying if it is ever bottled.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

751,"2013-05-16",3.3,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2015 First rating: Small offwhite head.  Hazy deep dark red body. Perfumy plums and dried fruit aroma with spicy herbal apple notes. Dry-sweet alcoholic chocolate taste with nougat and vanilla notes. Mid-bodied. Sharpish mouthfeel. Dryish earthy wooden chocolatey aftertaste with vanilla alcohol notes. Nice, but a bit alcoholic. (0.2l draft at Crow Bar, Oslo.) 6,4,6,3,13=3.2

Second rating: Gusher. Which I would have caught in time, were it not for the
gimmicky feathers the brewers glued onto the neck of the bottle.
After mopping up, head is medium-sized and beige.  Funky earthy rye
aroma with metallic wooden notes.  Very aromatic, smelled it the whole
time while I was cleaning the table and the floor.  Sweetish mealy
chocolatey taste with wooden syrup notes.  Full-bodied.  Mild, soft,
slightly flat mouthfeel.  (Flat, huh? Now how could that be?)  Dryish
mealy chocolatey fruity aftertaste with funky earthy spicy notes.
Perhaps even a little cinnamon.  This was actually very nice.
Balanced and harmonic, and easy to drink.  After youve cleaned up,
that is.  (0.75l bottle, from Fish & Beer, Copenhagen.) 6,4,6,3,14=3.3","Oslo, NORWAY","larsga"

But the beers starts with some acetic apples and pears. Then loads of soft vanilla and toasted coconut and very mild tangy rye whisky. Trace of wood. Mild estery bubblegum before the smooth semi dry finish. Ian Harrison would describe this as barrelled to within and inch of its life.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"

Slightly hazy copper brown with a small off-white head.
Bourbon on the nose straight off with wood tones and a little lemon.
The bourbon is more subtle in the taste, again woody, some malt and ry.
Palate is the lighter end of medium bodied with matching carbonation, if anything a little too thin for a 7%+ ABV beer with some complex flavours to it!","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"

The flavor has toasted rye bread splashed with caramel, vanilla, the barrel notes are more mild than the nose would indicate and the finish is a bit soft.
