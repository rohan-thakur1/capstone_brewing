The pour is a hazy straw yellow color with a large white head that falls to a film, leaving a good bit of lace behind. The aroma is interesting. There is a very floral hop to it, with a light tropical fruit. There is a slight grassiness and a light malt backbone. Its pretty good. The flavor is very similar. There is a strong floral hop and grassiness to it with a light maltiness and a decent tropical fruit addition. The mouth feel is a little heavy for an IPA and the carbonation doesnt help.

3852,"2015-10-19",4.2,"On tap at Prohibition Pig brewpub, Waterbury, Vermont.
This was poured into a half pint glass, the brewpub normally pours it in.
The appearance was a hazy blurry yellow color with a slim white little head that dissipated and left no lacing.
The smell started off with a sweet citrus and sweet grassy blend leading into subtle crisp tropical fruits and underscored by just a little bit of bitter pine.
The taste had a moderate amount of sweetness with some light bitterness of the pine carrying itself back into the balance of it all. A light citrus aftertaste runs into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a nice sessionable crispness carrying itself along my tongue.

3852,"2015-07-28",4.4,"Draught at Three Penny, 7/24/15Lightly-to-moderately hazy golden-brass body is topped by a medium-sized white head showing strong retention.Simcoe has to be one of the most amazing dry hops....no garlic, onion, cat pee issues with it and when its used in a dry/late-hop capacity, you dont get the heavy pine/resin that is associated with boiling it for too long. Instead, juicy red grapefruit, tangy pine, sweet mango and light wintergreen surge forth. Theres a lot more leafy, lush, rather spicy floral notes here, which are well-appreciated and highly enjoyable. The pale malts, well-attenuated, provide soft, unobtrusive balance in the background. Clean yeast character, flawless and with no resin problems or alcohol.The flavor has the creamy texture of the Excursions #4 I just had, but with a tighter carbonation that helps lend crispness to the beer. Light wintergreen, spruce, lime and red grapefruit flit about the palate, while a very gentle maltiness balances just like in the nose. Bitterness builds some towards the finish, but never to the point of fatigue. Extremely drinkable, flavorful and lacking any harsh pine or heavy bitterness. Nothing flashy, and some may not be wowed by its relative tameness, but the execution and elegance here are right up there with the best IPAs Ive ever had.

Taste: More of the same from the nose - juicy grapefruit, orange juice, orange zest, and tangerine pulp. A touch of raw doughy sweetness. Lightly acidic from the orange juice. Finishes with a lingering citrus juiciness. 

Mouthfeel: Ridiculously refreshing and bursting with citrus juice. A lightly tingling carbonation mixes well with the acidity from the juice. Finishes with a lingering citrus.

3852,"2014-04-01",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Eminent grapefruit and flower petals leap from this IPAs dry and quenching mouthfeel, leading to green bitterness and delicate tartness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam settles atop the hazy blond.
-The citrusy fruitiness is also reminiscent of Meyer lemons.
-This is dangerously poundable.
-Pretty much any Hill Farmstead IPA is world-class. You just cant go wrong, just grab one, whatever its called.

Nose is fresher nectarine, peach juice, grapefruit. Taste is interesting- different for sure with way more rustic cornmeal and crackery malt than its Hill Farmstead peers. In the finish is more than expected herbal medley with a hint of sugar cube- rosemary, sage, white pepper. No soapiness or harsh bitterness- this is more juicy and complete than many IPAs including top Hill Farmstead offspring. I want to give this a 5 for palate because it really does something amazing like a blend of herbal garden, thick mango juice, blood orange seltzer, and rustic cornmeal and whole grain cracker. Really impressive and bold. Nuanced. Quite a special beer. If you approach this beer as a saison instead of an IPA, I think your mindset will change to really appreciate the soft, special nuances this one has to offer. The soft sourdough cracker, whole cracked wheat, and rustic farm malt backbone blend with refreshing yellow and orange nectar fruits. Aromatic, beautiful nose with Meyer lemon and kumquat liquor matches a herbal garden medley in the taste. Really should be moved to saison in my opinion. But overall, it is nice to have refreshing, soft IPAs and APAs that are blending with the saison style. Tired Hands has the same dilemma. Every successive sip of this beer brings so many memories of the best of APA, IPA, and saison into one. Really a beautiful, moving experience. 8/4/10/5/18=4.5","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

How: Tap at Parker Pie, West Glover VT.
The look: Cloudy yellow-blond body topped by a persistent small white head leaving lots of lacings on the glass.
In long: The hoppy is extremely bright, very lemony, white grapefruits, lemongrass, flowers. In mouth the beer feels light-body, lighter body than expected for a 6.7% beer. The crispy crackery cereals remain discreet and feels a bit wheaty-dry, sensation of my original plain Shredded Wheat breakfast cereals. Assertive hopping that feels halfway between lemongrass and white grapefruits. Also some watermelon. Very bright and clean. Light tartness-acidity. Refreshing beer.

3852,"2013-06-05",4.1,"750 ml growler from PhillyCraft. Thanks Vin! It pours a very pale, hazy yellow color with a good white head. Glad to see this held carbonation over the long trip. The aroma is a bit dank with some light spicy and citrusy hops. Very light malt character, maybe some light pilsner and wheat. The flavor is the same. Bright citrus and spicy hops with some pilsner like quality. A little passionfruit as it warms with a citrus peel like bitterness that creeps in at the very finish. Incredibly smooth, soft mouthfeel. Man, this is tasty stuff. Another winner.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3852,"2013-06-02",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2013 750ml growler... Pours a golden yellow hay tint, haze throughout, and topped with a creamy white head... Aroma of fresh grass and dank grapefruit notes that runs assertively throughout.  Juicy from an ipa aspect and really delectable. Some mild sweetness throughout... Flavors are more of the same piney juicy grapefruit and citrus. Dank and juicy and juicy. Semi sweet through the middle with a more of that pronounced hoppy character. Just shy of medium bodied with semi-lively carbonation. Really easy clean hoppy drinking.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

Smells super musky, little bit of lemon and orange, lots of orange zest, tons of musk.  Medium bodied, musky, little bit of citrus, velvety and smooth.  Really smooth bodied, wheat, lemon, musk, vague hints of coriander into the finish.  Musk, citrus.  Delicious.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

Taste is moderately sweet with pine, citrus, tropical fruits and light to moderate bitterness. Medium body. Dry. The aroma of this IPA is wonnderful.
