1929,"2016-04-24",3.1,"Honningfarvet, rolig og ufiltreret English Pale Ale med mindre offwhite skumtop på 1-2 cm. 
Næsen rammes indledningsvis kun af lidt bondegård-aroma. Senere lidt frugt og noter fra havremalten. 
En halvfrisk, let syrlig, frugtagtig smag indledningsvis, som overtages af en middel sødme, og dernæst en kraftig, typisk engelsk, bitterhed, som ikke lige er mig smagsmæssigt. 
Øllet har en mellem fyldig krop og en middel karbonering. Bitterbesk og kort afslutning. 
Overall: Den engelske Pale Ale er ikke min personlige favorit, men jeg antager, at dette bud er et rimeligt forsøg i genren. Dog ikke Herslevs bedste øl. 
0.5 L, flaske, 5.9 % ABV, batch#1131, BB: 19/08/16, købt i Irma på Roskildevej i Valby.
