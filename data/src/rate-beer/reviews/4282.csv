4282,"2016-11-21",3.5,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2017 Update on April 17, 2017: another bottle from SinH4, this time 5 months before the best by date! This bottle is significantly rounder than my prior experience. There still isnt as much of a hop nose as I would have expected from some of the other ratings but there is definitely some citrus mixed in amongst the domination of crackers, grain and hay. Maybe Im just broken from all those I(I{I})PAs? The fresher bottle isnt as dry as my previous experience but is pretty low on sweetness compared to many other Helle. Body feels surprisingly round, for its dryness it doesnt leave a watery impression but rather cuts the grain aroma with a well placed hop finish. All in all, pretty much a Helles to my taste even if I could do with some more hops on the nose.

bottle from sinh4: sadly backlogged until two weeks past best by date. Appearance is light copper to gold, darker than I would have expected for a Helles. Smell is restrained but mostly straw and hay, hints of citrus but faint. Mouthfeel is surprisingly dry for a Helles, on par with some belgian saisons even. Carbination is lively but sadly overshadowed by a sharp hop bitterness on finish. Overall not a round beer but some lovely traits. Will update ratings if I get my hands on a fresh bottle.","Zurich, SWITZERLAND","derA"
