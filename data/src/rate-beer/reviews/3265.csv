3265,"2015-08-30",3.1,"11 ounce pour - $10.00 at Taco Mac in Woodstock, Georgia.

Appearance: Deep golden-hued body, lightly hazed beneath a fine, white head.

Smell: A sweetish, perfumy, heavily phenolic bouquet with its boosting spices, some citrus and some addling alcoholic updrafts.

Taste: Honeyed maltiness, lightly bready. Moderate sweetness of blonde syrups. Slightly tangy in taste. Generously phenolic, abundant in clove, coriander and pepper. Bitterish, redolent dried citrus rinds. A little harsh and biting in the booze factor leading to a somewhat sharp finish.

3265,"2015-02-09",4.0,"750ml bottle, from Dutchs. Date stamp is difficult to read. "".3/14"" ? First part is kind of blurred/stretched out. Enjoyed from a Chimay Goblet. Hazy orange color. Thin off-white / khaki head. Leaves good ridges of lace. Looks pretty good, aside from being a touch darker than Im used to for a tripel. Pours with moderate-plus strength carbonation, but not uncomfortably nor unnecessarily strongly carbonated (like some belgian beers can be). Medium to bigger body, good full feel. Mildly dry finish. Really fantastic big, bright complex fruity flavor. Definitely different than your typical tripel, but its a good thing, much more interesting. Much more of a bright citrus aspect that is really pleasant. Mild spiciness. Banana bread. Seeing the (mild) pear. Nice mild biscuity malt breadiness. Love how this manages to be not too sweet unlike most tripels, the nice mild dry finish is pretty pleasant. Just a moderate sweetness, and a moderate bitterness, with a pleasant very mild warmth at the end. Very easy and pleasant to sip on overall. A fantastic tripel.

3265,"2014-01-07",4.0,"Pours a pastel yellow. A soft golden color like sunshine with a bit of an orange hue when held to the light in the room but with a much brighter lemon color when held to the natural light. A fingers worth of perfect white foam that falls fast but then stays with a ring and film on top. 

Nose is bright with fruit. Tropical fruity twang that hints at pineapple, a soft stone fruit sweetness of apricot and a bright citrus zest. Earthy yeast on the nose give it depth and the malt is a rumor of bread. Mild spice and pepper. 

The taste is elegant and reserved. It is smooth and creamy but has plenty of bubbles to tickle your tongue and enliven the palate to all the flavors. It drinks like a charm. A bit thin and not too sweet with a touch of dryness and a bit of tartness from the fruit. The grain is light in the body of the beer as it warms and adds a supple quality to the drink. There is a touch of alcohol that enhances the fruit sweetness. The aftertaste is long and dry and this has a mild spice and pepper finish that is simply wonderful.","New York, USA","pinkie"

Some nice spotty lacing on the glass, with a decent amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of lemon, apricot, pepper, herbal, pear, candi sugar, coriander, bread, and yeast spice. Very nice and balanced aromas; with good strength and complexity. Taste of big lemon, pepper, pear, apricot, biscuit, coriander, herbal, grape, candi sugar, tart grain, and yeast spices. Lightly tart spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, apricot, pear, pepper, coriander, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great balance of fruity sweetness and spiciness; with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a nice fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel as expected for the style. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly an warming present after the finish. Very smooth to drink, but is still a bit of a sipper. Overall this is a highly excellent Tripel! A lot of great flavor; with nice spicy flavor balance and very smooth to drink. Ommegang needs to make a Tripel year round.

Corked bottle and served in my Big Ole Tripel Karmeliet glass:  Tasted side by side with Two Brothers Oh Brother! Tripel Ale and Straffe Hendrik Brugs Tripelbier 9° App: Slightly hazed amber hue with a lovely frothy head and good lace. 2nd best looking of the three (4) Aroma: Flowery and herbal with some apricot, lemon curd, mint leaves, pepper, moderate alcoholic phenols and earthy yeast esters. A bit weaker than the Straffe Hendrik and more flowery and fruity. (7)  Spicy and aggressive booze strikes you right away with lots of biscuity and caramelized malts. Moderate fruit and herbal notes but the seems simple and brash compared to the others, this could use a year of aging too. Typical of many brews from Ommegang. Pitty and nutty undertones do hold out hope for mellowing. (6)  Mouth Feel and Overall: Very sprite and lively but that harsh alcohol tone put an end to my mellow. (3) Started strong by the constant abuse of the palate by the sugary palate and brash unruly booze keeps this from becoming a top notch Tripel. It is NOT Perfection by any means.

3265,"2011-01-03",4.2,"Had this before-but not reviewed. This bottle is part of the Ommegang gift set I bought last week. 750ml bottle poured into my Ommegang flute glass.

A- Body is a slightly hazy golden yellow hue. Pours with a nice 2-3 finger sopay white head that eventually fades to about 1.5 fingers and has perfect retention from there. Bubbles can be seen slowly rising to the top of the glass. Traces of lacing left behind. Cloudiness is uniform. The appearance is exactly what I am looking for in this style.

S- Nose is rather soft. Soft floral hops and moderate green apple scent, and mild peppery spice with a hint of alcohol. The apple is most evident but keeps a nice balance with the other components. Good-and classic for the style.

T- Taste is very mild upfront. Mild floral hops creep in first with an accent of peppery spice and a hint of apple deep in the backbone. The hops and spice intensify as the apple fades and the finish has a sharp (but moderate in strength) floral hop bitterness to it with an accent of alcohol. What is left to linger is a moderate floral hop bitterness, moderate peppery spice, and mild apple wraped in a warm alcohol blanket.

M-High carbonation and a light to medium weight body that is initially smooth and yeasty...then dry. The change in consistency is intersting.

D- This is a great Tripel overall. Not quite ""perfection"" but just as good if not better than a lot of traditional examples of the style-which this represents nicely. This should be called Fantastic Tripel instead (lol)- another great brew from one of my favorite breweries. Im surprised that this Belgian-style brewery does not have a regular release tripel.

3265,"2010-12-23",3.8,"A solid pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a fat, three-finger thick, pale, off-white colored head that leaves some spotty lacing as it slowly recedes.  The beer is a pale, orange-gold color that shows a hazed, light straw-gold color when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of lemon zest, earthy coriander like spiciness, a fair amount of clove like phenolics that almost gets musty and medicinal towards the finish.  I really like how floral this beer, it has suggestions of a floral honey, though without the sweetness so it really makes it seem like fresh, flower nectar; notes of honeysuckle intermingles with orange blossom and maybe even a hint of dried grassiness.  This grassiness is also contributed by the light malt character that also supplies notes of pale wheat crackers and a touch of doughy malt; the malt really doesnt start to come out in the nose until the beer warms up.  The aroma of this beer is really quite nice; the complex interplay of spice, floral characteristics, fruit and grain strikes a really great balance and expressive character.

Dry and spritzy with carbonic fizz at it first hits my palate, the beer definitely foams up as it rolls across the tongue and it picks up a perceived sweetness that seems more ester / fruit derived than from lots of residual sugars.  The carbonic character combines with phenols to numb the tongue just a bit and the beer definitely has an ample, though not overly aggressive, flavor of clove in the finish.  Some of the medicinal, almost astringent like notes seems to linger a fair amount in the finish.  The texture of this beer is almost exactly what I want in a Tripel; nicely light bodied, effervescent, but with a nice, softly creamy texture that manages to coat the palate for a short bit without even approaching heavy.  The malt character here is actually quite subtle; it contributes perhaps a touch of honey like character, a touch of faint grassiness and a hint of cracker like malt that lingers a bit in the finish.  The beer can be a bit phenolic in the finish at times (especially as it warms), though I think much of this is accentuated by the fact that this has such a nice, light body to it such that it isnt masked by a sticky sweetness.

The aroma of this beer is quite heavenly; though the flavor doesnt quite live up to this beginning this is still a really nice example of a Tripel.  I really like how this achieves the texture and lightness that a really good example of a Tripel should.  As the beer warms up it gets closer to having a flavor more reminiscent of the aroma (with lots of citrus and floral notes), but it still has that almost harsh, phenolic finish.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Ill go try to take a nibble of some food to see if that makes this any better.  Maybe its me?","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
3265,"2010-07-23",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Delicate cereals, floral, spicy subtleties, restrained esters and talkative wooden hop bitterness coalesce in this very authentic Tripel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the golden haze, lacing nicely.
-The soft effervescence and classy mouthfeel are everything you expect from the style.
-Alcohol heat is felt throughout.
-This is as authentic as it gets this side of the Atlantic, but then again this Tripel doesnt stand out much from all the other very good examples of the style available to us.

A: Pours a light orange with a one finger white head.

T: Big spicy flavor, same as in the aroma, followed by banana and that Belgian funk.

Pours a hazy orange with a thick white head that leaves nice lacing through out the glass.

Nose has lots of soft fruits, peaches and a bit of orange. There is a hoppy /spice note that is grassy with a hint of nutmeg.

The mouthfeel is very nice. While the alcohol on this is high it is balanced with a great effervescence. The brew seems to melt on your tongue with only the slightest prick of astringency.

The flavor is  rich with a yeasty body and a metallic finish. The esters produce a background bubblegum that is quickly covered by the spice. There is a single tone that I couldnt quite pick out, but made the overall stroll very interesting. Coriander, maybe?

 This is nicely executed triple, especially for a first bottling. A little tweaking might push this into a truly outstanding example of the style. Looking forward to seeing this develop.","Reading, Massachusetts, USA","jeckenroth"

3265,"2010-06-11",3.3,"750ml bottle.  Pours a cloudy, glowing, medium golden-orange color. A small, smooth, pure white head settles to a thin film and then a hollow ring, leaving frosted window pane sheeting on the glass.  The aroma is of course based in blonde candy sugar, with notes of spicy coriander, sweet orange peel, and tangerine and citrus blossom hop notes.  Flavors are a little more bitter, with tangerine or clementine hops asserting themselves along with prominent, earthy coriander to counter the sugary-sweet candy sugar malts.  The yeast profile is quite spicy and fruity, which is nice, but ultimately the alcohol is entirely too prominent, and the coriander is a little heavy handed.  On the palate, sugar and booze are quite evident, and the carbonation seems overly prickly and harsh.

Flavor is slightly sweet but not too much, dries out a bit which is nice. Crisp with a hint of citrus, spice and yeast with a nice body. Well balanced and I like the dry finish. Cant wait to try the bottles.","Kingston, New York, USA","yobdoog"
3265,"2010-03-05",3.7,"Slightly hazy golden pour with a bready spice and wheat aroma. Flavor is also bread with a sweet malt dry finish and a touch of fruit. I enjoyed it.","Levittown, Pennsylvania, USA","MadIndian"
3265,"2010-01-24",3.7,"BCTC 2009.  Pours a hazy medium bright copper with a medium white head.  Aroma is doughy, toast, spicy phenolics, orange citrus,- lemon and fruity esters.  Flavor is cracker, doughy, spicy phenolic light ester, bready malts, a bit of sweetness in the middle- honey- then dries out a bit in the end.  Pretty good.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
3265,"2009-09-26",3.7,"Great huge head over hazy golden body ... Belgian ""lemon meringue pie"" appearance.  Nose of yeast and grain.  Taste of yeast and black pepper and bready but somehow muddy rather than crisp and distinct flavors or the distinct yeasty flavor I expect in a great tripel.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"
3265,"2009-03-23",3.8,"Anything from this place is good. No exception here.  nice golden color with a fluffy head. Typical flavor for a triple. Great aroma. Nice dry finish. Good stuff.","Sicklerville, New Jersey, USA","keepersj12"
3265,"2009-03-20",4.1,"On tap at Maxs Belgian Fest as Wes Tripel: Pours a hazy golden with a well-lacing wispy white head.  Aroma of sweet biscuity pale malt and clove spice with some notes of cinnamon and Belgian yeast.  Starts with good fullness and sweet doughy malts with some light fruity complexity and good peppery clove balance.  Finishes drier and very true to style.  A very enjoyable tripel.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3265,"2008-10-26",3.8,"on tap at the Blind Tiger. Lightly hazy golden in color with some orange hues, medium white head.  Aroma of light spice, yeasty and a bit musty, in a good way- and some nice fruitry esters and pils malt.  Taste is fruity and spicy, with some spicy esters and light spices, but nowhere near as spicy as I expected this one to be.  Moderately sweet, with some mild candi sugar and light honey-like sweetness. Finishes with a light hop bitterness. Medium bodied, overall pretty nice.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
3265,"2008-10-23",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 10, 2011 Rerate from a 750 ml bottle.  Hazy golden-orange colour with a tight white head.  The aroma is quite spicy and fruity.  Lots of orange peel and some heavy perfumey character.  Lots of Belgian yeasty spice and a fairly lovely bubble gum sort of character.  A cooling almost wintergreen sort of flavour with a touch of light peppery character as well.  Lots of peppery spice and a fairly rich but dry sort of phenolic character.  Warming really intensifies the yeasty muskiness.  Dryer than I recall it - which is a good thing.  Intensely spicy and herbal with a lot of black pepper and a little bit of cardamom.  Really excellent balance and quite a lovely brew.

Tap at Blind Tiger.  Deep golden colour with a thick white head.  Aroma is lightly sweet and lightly spicy.  A touch of Belgian pale malt and a pretty prominent apricot fruitiness.  Light clovey spice and some other actual spiciness (not yeasty).  Slightly fruity with a touch of grassy hoppiness.  A bit of earthiness on the back with just a bit of light banana esters.  Its less sweet than most US versions, but it could be drier still.  OK.

3265,"2008-10-23",3.9,"Draft at BTAH. Pours a cloudy gold, with a fluffy white head. Nose is classic tripel - apricot and spicy yeast, a bit of a dry sweetness. Taste is orange peel and citrus, apricots and spicy yeast. Balanced by a fresh, grassy hop bitterness that starts to emerge about midway Bit of alcohol, but it largely keeps its head down. Finishes with a dry, lingering mild bitterness. Very refreshing for a tripel. Crisp carbonation and a medium body. The grassy hops and the citrus up front definitely lend a beautiful, almost saison-like refreshingness to this one. Really well done.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","JohnQPublic"

3265,"2008-08-05",3.9,"Draft at BCTC. Nose of sweet belgian yeast and spices. Flavor is similar with a solid yeast presence and limited sweetness and dry finish.  Pretty frickin’ good tripel in my opinion.  I was quite impressed with this one and glad to try it since I missed it last year.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

3265,"2008-08-04",3.7,"Tap at BCTC. Ridiculously cloudy pour looks more like mustard than beer. Nice. Dry, yeasty aroma with a little bit of cake. Flavor has some residual sweetness and a huge body, remaining lightly yeasty with a good malt. Not a bad offering, though, despite the great body, I think a little filtering could brighten this beer and accentuate the yeast flavors. I look forward to seeing more of this as it gets refined.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
3265,"2008-08-04",3.7,"Draft @ BCTC.  Cloudy yellow colored body with a large white head, finely bubbles and foamy.  Fresh, festive nose of pillowy yeast, candy sugar, dry cobweb-like minerally yeast notes.  Crisp and pleasantly drying on the palate, feels somewhat parched at times.  Has some grassy/green vegetable flavor at times, not overly sweet, with dryness fluctuating from mild to intense through each drink and through the entire glass.  Well executed.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Medium-to-full mouthfeel: lots of honey, pepper, and yellow fruits; some bananas and cloves; spicy and lively in the mouth; solid, peppery tripel, if a bit big overall.
