846,"2014-09-04",3.3,"""Very good example of a pretty nice beer that was oversold. First off, the barrel influence is so light as to be almost sugestive, only manifesting in a slightly sweet maple aftertaste. Otherwise, a nice straightforward imperial pilsener. In other words, not a beer worth over a buck an ounce.""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
846,"2014-08-06",3.9,"12.7oz bottle. Shared with abistany. Bottle gushed a bit upon opening, open with caution. Moderately hazy golden orange color. Good thin off-white head. Leaves kind of loose lace, but thicker globs stick. Medium-plus body. Smooth, kind of soft, lighter carbonation. Lightly slick finish. Refreshing, bright, easy-drink. Not overcarbonated. Nice bready malt taste, good moderate citrus and peppery hop, and a nice light note of that maple syrup in the finish. It all works very nicely. Moderate bitter taste, good zestiness, light to moderate sweet. Alcohol well-hidden. Great stuff. Very complex and well-integrated, it works well.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
846,"2014-06-21",3.9,"Bottle from Total Wine in Folsom, CA. Pours light orange gold with a slight white head. Aroma of cooked caramel. With some following noble hop. Med body or better. Flavor is noble hop quickly subsumed by maple. Really quite different, but clearly pilsener for the basics. Rather intriguing.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

Light malt sweetness, little bitterness. The barrels are easy to detect, and Im starting to appreciate the barrel aged lighter beers.

846,"2013-10-29",3.0,"375mL bottle, pours a clear dark copper orange with a large white foamy head. Nose is full of grass, very crisp, with some dry sharp biscuity, and grassy hops. Flavour brings out quite a bit of pepper and spices, atop some grassy hops, and yeast. No hint of maple syrup or barrel character at all - surprising. Not sure what they were going for here, but its a bit of a mess. Decent attempt, but a bit off the mark.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
