How: Tap on location at the brewery
The look: Very dark brown body topped by a small medium beige head
In long: Nose is pungent uber-hoppy with freshly-cut pine-tree, grapefruits and fresh green hop peletts.  Malt backbone is medium roasted, a bit of caramel, a bit of burnt chocolate, rye.  I thought the rye here gave the beer a dryer woody rye barrel aged character more than the usual juicy spicy rye character of a rye beer.  Then the truckload of hops with a very vibrant flavor.  Same as the aroma (freshly-cut pine-tree, grapefruits and fresh green hop peletts) but also quite resinous.  Bitterness level is medium-high.  This is fantastic black ipa.

Nice one inch off white head falls slowly with pretty lacing.  Aroma is the rye up front, followed close behind with roast malt and pine hops.  Really fresh clean and balance nose.  Taste follows suit, rye, roasted malt and pine hops all nicely blended and well balanced.  Palate is medium bodied, aftertaste lingers with the nice soft roastiness.  Nice one.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

The aroma is very nice lots of rye, coffee, hoppy finish... The taste has more hops than anything, a very hoppy rye beer. Light roast coffee with lots of pine hops.

3988,"2011-02-25",4.3,"Tap at BT.  Black Rye IPA.  Pours a nice deep dark nearing pitch black with a good frothy head- nice lace.  Aroma is big spicy rye malts, mixed with some slight roast, mostly clean though- and tons of raw aggressive fresh pine-like hops, some citrus, and mint.  Flavor has a bold assertive raw spicy rye that really makes the malt and the hops pop out- fresh citrus, pine, resin and dank weed.  Side by side to the Narconaut, this one wins hands down- and the rye is what sets it aside- it gives the beer almost a fullness of body without making it sweet and still keeps it refreshing and easy to drink.  I loved it.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
3988,"2011-02-24",3.9,"On Tap at the Blind Tiger.  Pours a deep cloudy brown with a medium sized tan head.  Aroma consists of a nice dose of earthy style hops coupled with a caramel malt undertone.  Taste is hops forward with a nice balance of the same caramel malt from the nose, finishes long and dry with the rye really coming to is own in the end.  Easy to put down, has a medium body and is silky smooth in the mouth.  Excellent beer, the first I have had from them, kudos!",", New Jersey, USA","mikalooch"
3988,"2011-02-12",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2012 re-rating for the winter 11-12 batch. poured from a 750ml growler. pours brown just about black color (more black than brown...) with a lively but dense latte colored head that hangs out for quite a while. Hovering just above the glass there is a rich potent blast citrus and pine sting with a chocolatey roastiness. taste begins with an explosion of hop flavors that are stinging my best guess is chinook. the color makes you think stout but the malt flavor is lighter and cleaner without any astringency. mouthfeel has the perfect bitter bite and medium body with moderate smooth carbonation.  I shouldve got a 2L...","New Jersey, USA","fbm115"
3988,"2011-02-06",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
Spicy rye and herbal, coniferous hops gloriously coalesce in this eminently drinkable Black IPA.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the brown-edged darkness.
-The resinous hop bitterness is firm, lasting well beyond the end of each sip. Balance might not be achieved in the end, although this might be because the brew is super fresh.
-As for all Hill Farmstead brews, the soft, natural carbonation and controlled residual sugars make for a superbly comfortable mouthfeel.
-This is yet another truly delightful IPA from Shaun. I cant figure out if there is one I prefer because they are all impeccable.

On tap at Hill Farmstead.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
