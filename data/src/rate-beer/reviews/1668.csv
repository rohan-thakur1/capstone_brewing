1668,"2013-05-24",3.6,"24.05.2013. On tap at Henriks øl og vin, Bergen. Dark brown with only a thin layered tan head. Aroma of burnt dark malts. Lots of flavours of dark malts with notes and flavours of smoke and campfire. Lots of flavours and very firm body for a beer with thus low abv. Aftertaste is dry bitter with smoke and dark malts.","Haugesund, NORWAY","RuneStumo"
1668,"2013-04-30",4.2,"On tap at Schouskjelleren. Pours pitch Black with a creamy head. Great aromas of roasted chestnuts, roasted malts, coffee and toasted bread. Amazing mouthfeel for a 3,7% ale! Kind of sad that this isnt available where I live...","Stavanger, NORWAY","DominoVixen"
1668,"2013-04-29",3.6,"On tap at Henrik, Bergen. Pours almost pitch black with a small tanned head. Inviting aroma of roasted malts and coffee, liquorice and toffee. Taste follows up the good promises from the aroma, lots of malty goodies presence, also some vanilla and good liquorice, light tar as well. Exceptional big body for a 3,7%, smooth carbonated.","Sandnes, NORWAY","gunnar"

1668,"2013-04-16",3.9,"On tap at Schouskjelleren, march 7th 2013. As its always kind of dark at the place the beer locks black at first but shows to be dark brown up against the light, covered by a small light brown head. Due to having the flue my sense of smell is pretty low but I can clearly sense a good wood and roasted coffee aroma here. Taste is massive for a beer of this strength, burned wood, licorice, roasted malt toffee more in the style of a heavier beer. Good dry palate, more fruity towards the end witha dry fruity finish. This beer has to be some of the best you can get as low as 3,8%. Though I know Gahr&Kim do some excellent brewing from before this was my first beer from ABC brewing, and I can only say keep the good stuff coming guys!","NORWAY","daje"
1668,"2013-04-16",3.5,"Medium dark brown head. Opaque black body. Sooty earthy coffee grounds aroma with dusty notes. Dry-sweet fruity sooty taste with dusty resiny notes, Mid-bodied. Mild, dusty mouthfeel, very soft. Dryish blackberry and resin aftertaste with burnt grain notes. Very harmonic and drinkable. Excellent.

1668,"2013-04-06",3.9,"On tap at Schouskjelleren. Pitch black as far as I can see in this dark, candle lit basement. No light gets through, not even in the edges. Nice roasty aroma with notes of chocolate, coffee and burnt wood. Suprisingly nice and flavourful, especially with such low ABV. Lightly sweet with nice roasty flavours and dry and lightly bitter finish. Very well balanced and easy to drink. Amazing beer!","Tallinn, ESTONIA","visionthing"
1668,"2013-03-27",3.9,"On tap @ Henrik. Yeah, I guess you can call this a black one. Struggling to see through it, and it has a small but somewhat fading light brown top that sticks quite elegant to the sides of the glass. Oh my this smell really good! Its loaded with dark roasted sweetness. Milky sweet darkness with caramel, fudge, a lovely roastiness and thee is even traces of vanilla in here. Im really impressed. Considering this is a 3.something ABV beer it actually has traces of a mouthfeel. Almost silky smooth and the carbonation has those small prickling bubbles I like so much. Dont get me wrong, its not hard to tell that this is a light beer, but one of the best mouthfeels Ive had in a beer of this caliber. The taste immediately reminds me of minerals. Often  that is not a good thing, but this has some quite interesting and good, to be honest, flavors. Thin cold coffee, chocolate nuts, a roasted flavors that suits this kind beer just perfect! Give this to a Guinness junkie and I feel convinced that guy will be converted. By far the best Ive tasted from these Nomadic brewers. 13.03.2013","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Roasty and dry.
Very good.
A lot of taste - I was very surprised to learn that this beer holds only 3,7 ABV. Judging by appearance and taste, I guessed 5-6 ABV.
Salutations to the brewers!","NORWAY","nygard67"
1668,"2013-03-14",3.5,"On tap at Henrik, Bergen. Pours a deep brown to black colour with a beige creamy medium to big head. Has a great roasted aroma with coffee and sweet dark chocolate. The flavour follows up with a lot of roasted coffee. Has a light and slick mouth feel, and a medium to heavy coffee bitterness. A good, tasteful and aromatic dry stout on only 3,7%!","Bodø, NORWAY","Foffern"
1668,"2013-03-13",3.9,"On tap @ Henrik, Bergen. The very celebration beer for Henriks twenty years of nourishing Bergens beer-thirsty population - Im excited! :-) Pours a deep, near-black body with a large creamy beige head. Aroma is deep leathery licorice and ground coffee tones, toffee, bread crust and hints of caramel and cream. Nice. Taste is complex malt tones imbued with caramel, toffee, burnt toast, ashes, espresso, grains and hints of dark chocolate and licorice far in the back. Full, creamy body with mild carbonation. This one has nearly everything youd expect from a full-blown stout, with the exeptipn of boozy tones and warming alcohol, which is of course due to the low ABV. A highly drinkable and remarkably well-brewed dry stout from ABC Brewing, which beats the hell out of classics like Guinness. Well done! :-)","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"
