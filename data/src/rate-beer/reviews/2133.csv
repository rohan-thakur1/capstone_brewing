2133,"2014-05-11",3.8,"Draft... Hazy amber ale with dirty-orange highlights and a large, rocky, white head. Good retention. The nose is a mingling of toasted grains, citrus peel, pink peppercorns and a light note of spicy farmhouse yeast. Medium to full-bodied with jazzy carbonation. The flavor presents pink peppercorns, toasted grains, a modest measure of citrus zest and a light pinch of clove. Snappy, peppery, dry finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2133,"2013-11-25",3.7,"On tap at the brewpub. Clear gold pour with a creamy white head. Huge aromatics on this beer, with pepper, flowers of all kinds, citrus peel. Flavor follows the smell with some nice citrus rind, a little spiciness, low to medium sweetness. This comes out very refreshing, there is a little lingering straw flavor, and it finishes crisp as can be. Light body with medium to high carbonation. This was actually very nice and you could drink it all day long in the sun.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"

2133,"2013-07-30",3.4,"Growler pour thanks to Sean! Pours clear golden orange with a medium creamy off-white head that slowly dissipates leaving nice lacing. Aroma is hay, honey, yeast, pepper. Flavor is about the same, medium sweet, just a touch of bitter and some pepper bite, but that is more prominent in the aftertaste. Medium body. Drinkable for sure, but nothing to write home about.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

Flavor is similar- yeast, pepper, floral, and some sweet malt. I love the added complexity from the peppercorns. Medium in body and nice overall.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

2133,"2013-06-27",4.0,"On tap at Cigar City Brewpub in Carrollwood, FL. Another brew that I was really impressed with. The peppercorns came through incredibly well and added balance that I imagine may have been lacking in the original La Rubia. That being said, I never had that one, so I can't really judge.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","Sperine"

2133,"2013-06-21",3.5,"Growler shared thanks to scotchzi! Pours a hazy yellow with fluffy white head that leaves moderate lacing. Aroma of Belgian yeast, slight spicy and citrus esters. Taste follows, a nice spicy sweet back end, can taste the peppercorn more than smelling it. Solid, interesting.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"
