1408,"2015-12-25",3.7,"12 ounce bottle - $2.49 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a lightly hazed, dimmed gold body with an inch of steadily receding, stray white foam. Very thin lacing.

Smell: Rather unsubstantial in the malt department, aromawise. Mainly, its hop-based aromatics - plenty of tropical, citrusy delights and spicy, minty, resinous elements.

Taste: A lightly biscuity, bready maltiness given a little tickle of sweet honey. This one has an active, juicy fruitiness, tastes of pineapple, passion fruit and sweet orange zest. Fairly restrained bitterness. Growing sense of mint leaf. Fruity, lightly spicy and with a hint of the alcohol on the drying, gently bitterish finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium carbonation.

Overall: While Id hoped for an offering that was a little more faithful and authentic to the style, Im honestly not surprised its just another something-hoppy. Though, for being something more akin to an IPA, it was reasonably tasty.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

1408,"2015-10-05",3.9,"Hazy deep gold to amber. Big dank Nose of catty, herbal pine, tropical fruit, mango, pineapple, and candied malt. Flavor is tacky citrusy pine with more pineapple and thick golden malt. Lingering bitterness. Some grainy heat. Get over the double alt tag. I think we all knew this would essentially be an IPA, and it is a good one at that. Lagunitas with another solid one. Haters gonna hate.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
1408,"2015-10-05",3.4,"Bottle. Pours a hazy gold, big white head. Big fruity hops nose. Medium bodied, fruity and sticky but surprisingly dry, mango, Juicy Fruit gum, lemon zest, passion fruit. Most fucking definitely NOT an altbier at all (and about as fucking German as putting ketchup on bratwurst)... but for an APA/IPA, not bad. Tony is still a douchebag.","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"
1408,"2015-10-02",3.8,"Tap. Pours cloudy orange, medium white head, great lacing. Aroma is hoppy, citrus, grapefruit. Flavor is light plus sweet, light plus bitter. Medium body, creamy","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
1408,"2015-09-29",3.5,"I find it hard to imagine a beer much further than an altbier than this but I suppose it is a good enough IPA. Its very cloudy w/ a foamy white head. This beer is all about dense, sticky, dank American-seeming hops, lightly sweet and not too bitter. I really dont get any of the malt or hop character Id expect from the style and its not even really the right color. It smells and tastes good though so not all is lost.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
1408,"2015-09-29",3.5,"Bottle from LifeSource. Hazy medium amber in color. Sweet hoppy nose. Mostly notes of citrus. Smells like a Lagunitas altbier. Pretty highly hopped with a fairly dry spicy backbone. A touch of sweetness with a nice hoppy finish. A light touch of alcohol as well. Doesnt really taste to style, but is still pretty tasty.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
1408,"2015-09-27",3.8,"Aroma is wonderful. Big and hoppy. Taste is sort of malty and hoppy. Not what I expected but really good.","Illinois, USA","Doghair"
1408,"2015-09-27",3.4,"On tap, poured into a shaker. The aroma is much like roasted street nuts with a light grassy note. A fuzzy gelatin white head tops a clear amber hued beer that leaves a good lace and retain. The taste is a medium high, mellow bittersweet thats balanced. The syrupy beer has a medium body and a fizzy zip with a palate of nuts, caramel, and a mild bitter and grassy herb. It finishes with a citrus zest turns to a woody spice and leaves and aftertaste thats waxy with a mild bitter spice thats a bit cloying. All-in-all, not too dissimilar to a hopped marzen.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"
1408,"2015-09-27",3.8,"Pours a finger of head on a hazy straw body.
The aroma is bright citrus (orange, lemon) with a pine background. Great.
The taste is solid dank bitterness throughout with a heavy malt presence. 
The texture is thicker.
Its got a great aroma, the taste is pretty heavy.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"
1408,"2015-09-26",3.7,"Bottled. Nice copper. Nice carbonation. Has a big bold citrus hop taste. Great beer.","Illinois, USA","Ahuth"
1408,"2015-09-23",3.0,"Lemon on the nose with straw notes, great fluffy head that stays full, pineapple bitter hoppiness, body thin, for a double alt bier it should be much, much maltier. Would have liked some caramel maltiness to balance the awesome hophead profile.","California, USA","leecasely"
1408,"2015-09-22",3.4,"Aromas of bountiful hops, pines, citrus, orange peel, tangerine, rice cracker and graham cracker. Pours a moderately cloudy, pale orange with a thin white foam. Taste brings lots of orange, orange zest, honey, pines, hop oils, caramel , golden malt and some cracker. Finishes very dry with subtle bitterness. Overall, the style says ""altbier"" but this tastes and smells like an IPA to me. Nice beer with a pleasant hop profile.","Los Angeles, CA, California, USA","Thisis12ptfont"
1408,"2015-09-21",3.9,"Tap at The Davis Beer Shoppe. Pours hazy dark gold with a creamy white head. Aroma has hints of dankness, and its hard to find malt. Med + body. It is dank. Some mix of citrus/pine/fruit? Malt is truly second tier to the hop. I doubt I would have identified this as an alt. And the ""word play"" is .... Oh well. Damn hoppy/good ale.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1408,"2015-09-11",3.8,"On tap at California Craft Beer Summit. Pours golden with a thick off-white head and a toffee aroma. There is a slightly sweet malty flavor with a more bitter finish.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
