4327,"2015-01-31",3.0,"This pours very nice--dark, with a cascade effect and lingering caramel head. The aroma is curious, with raisins, fleece blankets, and good cocoa. The flavor has the cocoa and a lingering fruitiness, and it finishes roasty with a light lactose. The body is disappointing: carbonation leaves it quickly and it feels very flat. O.k. but not great. Can.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
4327,"2015-01-22",3.8,"Can. Chocolate and caramel are pretty accurate for the aroma, or a vanilla chocolate milk. Opaque dark brown body with a hint of red when held up to light. Light brown head, mostly lasting. Chocolate milk is a pretty good description for the flavor. Chocolate milk with alcohol that is. Not overly Wintery in either taste nor in alcohol content, but its still an enjoyable brew.

4327,"2014-12-21",3.9,"Can. Pours a slightly hazy dark brown body under a one finger frothy light brown head. The nose is like dessert in a glass, tons of chocolate and caramel with some light coffee. The flavor is quite sweet, but I really dig it. Lots of chocolate and burnt caramel up front, fading to a slightly roasty finish. This is like drinking chocolate fudge. Medium bodied with no stickiness, which is surprising given how sweet it is, and soft carbonation. Pretty great stuff.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
4327,"2014-12-17",3.8,"Pours very, very, dark ruby red. Two fingers of tan, creamy head that dissipates slowly, with nice clinging. Sweet aroma, with fruit, some malt overtones, roasty, and chocolate. Moderate mouth feel (not thin, but not thick, either), but satisfying. Smokey, malty taste; the fruit taste is subtle and controlled. Sweetness is evident but not overpowering in the beginning, but becomes a bit cloying by the end. Very mild hop bitterness in the middle. I dont generally go for fruit beers, but this one is nicely balanced. All of the ""extra"" ingredients (cacao, vanilla, raisins, brown sugar) add subtle and very pleasant taste. This is a good tasting ale, even though as it warms the sweetness becomes a bit too much for me. YMMV.","Minnesota, USA","MNAle"

Aroma of dry raisin and brown sugar with a healthy dose of caramelized sugar is very interesting. Taste is also dominated by a healthy dose of caramelized malt with some dry raisins notes and some light residual brown sugar notes. Body is bit light to sustain all the spices and dry fruits notes with medium carbonation. Interesting beer but seems to be lacking a little bit malt profile.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

4327,"2013-11-08",3.9,"(can) Not sure why this isnt classified under spice/herb/veg with the cacao nibs and vanilla added, but it really makes no difference. Pours black with maybe a faint tinge of red around the edge and a medium tan head that quickly settles to a thin cap. Aroma is huge with cocoa nib, and at times it smells like a peanut butter cup. Also here are little pings of vanilla and raisin that strike and retreat in rapid succession. Pretty interesting stuff going on. Theres a certain what I describe as ""greenness"" that I get from the raisins (wonder if these are sultanas) which adds another ""wrinkle"" pun-intended into the aroma. Flavor is huge with cocoa nib, light vanilla, peanut butter cup, and just a sliver of raisin. Finish lingers with a boat load of cocoa, with a hint of Sumatra coffee. Indeed normally nails it in the palate category, but in this case, the beer is a bit thin and the carbonation stings a little. Overall this is an interesting beer that is perfect for the season, and its one that Ill certainly pick up again. Indeed is quickly becoming my favorite local brewery.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
