All this breweries beers seem to explode out the bottle, this one was no exception. This time I was ready for it and didnt lose a drop, the sediment however comes up with the rest of the brew, so you get everything in the glass.

Dark rustic brown body, too deep in colour to see through (plus the sediment is in there somewhere. Huge light brown head on top, which left plenty of lacing as the beer level sank during the tasting.

Aroma of burnt, roasted and toasted malts, without the sweet molasses smell often found in Belgian brown ales.

This isnt a sweet brown in any way, those malts in the smell hit you hard in the taste and a tart bitterness comes along as the mouth dries: this is more complexed than your average Belgian brown.

The alcohol content can be found easily enough, as the body isnt as rich and deep as the brew indicates by looks. Still fine, but this isnt a thick, heavy brew at all, it isnt watery either.

Trotz korrekter Lagerung schäumt das Bier nach dem Öffnen sofort über und verteilt sich auf dem Tisch. Nach diesem Intermezzo und einmal im Glas macht das Brune eine gute Figur. Schöne Bräune und guter Schaum. In Verbindung mit einem belgischen Kelchglas sieht das schon stimmig aus. 
Sehr intensiv sind die Geruchsaromen: malzig-schokoladig; unzweifelhaft auch likörartig. Der erste Geschmackseindruck fällt dann eher etwas enttäuschend aus. Pfeffrig und scharf alkoholisch. Die Malzigkeit des Bieres wird in den Hintergrund gedrängt. Das Ganze erinnert in seiner Süße an eine von Omas Pralinen mit Weinbrandfüllung. Ein wenig später und nach der Eingewöhnung des Gaumens erkennt man dann doch auch eine leichte Fruchtigkeit im Hintergrund.

the palate is ludicrously fizzy, and requires tons of swirling,

CO2, theres a sweet soft malty palate with a nice nutty burnt edge.

This beer was had from the impressive 2 liter bottles.  This beer has a fruity aroma to it.  It is a nice brown color with a good amount of head to it.  Well carbonated.  The taste is exquisite, a bit tart, a bit sweet with a taste that is evocative of apricots.  This beer was very enjoyable.

Rating, small format bottle, January, 2004
As I pop the swing top bottle it pops suddenly and a whisp of gun smoke follows.  This beer pours a deep red color, and is topped by a pale tan head.  It is very well carbonated.  Aromas of candied fruit, fruit cake, cherries and a general sweet character waft from my glass.  There is almost a fake fruitiness to this beer.  The taste is quite a bit drier than the aroma would suggest.  The fruitiness is here in the taste and still has the falseness to it in the finish as well.  No acidity to this beer, unlike the large format (2L) bottle I had in 2001.  Not nearly as good either.  The fake fruitiness is a bit distracting, it seems to be a fermentation byproduct perhaps.
