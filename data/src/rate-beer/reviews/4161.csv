4161,"2016-05-01",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 21, 2016 Cinnamon apple smell and taste. Being an apple pie mead, I have to compare it to Kurt?s Apple Pie from Moonlight.

4161,"2015-04-07",4.3,"From notes. Finally found the long-lost notebook from the 4 Elf Party at Dark Horse on December 13! So, thats where this was found. Shared by a passer-by for a chance to hang around the campfire wed built. Oh my god was this one something else. The pour was a clear darker yellow with a bright white ring of head that disappears quickly. The aroma is like Im smelling an apple pie. There is a lot of cinnamon and caramelized apples. Its like I just ordered some fried apples from Cracker Barrel. The flavor is even better. Behind all of the apples there is a wonderful graham cracker crust happening, with a touch of vanilla and some light brown sugar. The re is a bit of booze on the back end. The mouth feel is a little light. Its not quite syrupy like I was expecting, but its just good. The aftertaste is lingeringly spicy apple, and slightly warming. I need to find more of this!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Tasted like fresh, sugary sweet apple puree with all spice. The finish is where the honey showed up with a nice smooth, very slight boozy liqueur finish. Medium to thick body, a little syrupy feel to it. Great stuff. My entire family enjoyed it and theyre not beer or mead drinkers at all. Thanks Jeremy!","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"

4161,"2013-06-26",4.2,"On tap during Ohio Brew Week 2013, sample from Jackie-Os. Nearly colorless, as far as I can tell. Just a slight hue of yellow. No head or lace. Amazing aroma... Potent nose of baked apples and cinnamon spice. Very apple pie, spot on. Not sure how an apple pie mead could smell any better. Smells like an entire goopy apple pie, straight out the oven, concentrated into a single drop. Bigger body. Light, if any, carbonation. Lightly dry. Super-long apple pie aftertaste. Lighter to moderate sweet taste, not as sweet as I expected. Some spice. Crazy-good cyser. A barrel-aged version might be really interesting...","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
