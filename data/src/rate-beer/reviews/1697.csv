1697,"2017-05-20",4.0,"Yet another superb offering from Schneider-Weisse, who has quickly become our favorite German brewery. It pours a lovely golden cloudy orange with medium head and a rich lemony, wheaty, bubblegum smell. The taste is rich, refreshing, zesty, and surprisingly hoppy.

1697,"2017-04-28",4.0,"Lys sirupsfarvet German Hefeweizen med flot hvidlig tætskummende top, som langsomt svinder til landskaber. Ufiltreret og perlende. 
Gærnoter er det første, det rammer næsen. Dernæst noter af banan og citrus-lignende frugt. Senere igen fremkommer humlearoma af blomster. 
Første smagsindtryk er en mere humlet hvedeøl end andre af Schneiders lignende øl. Mere bitter. Stadig med hvedeøllets karakter i spil, men klart mere bitter og krydret. Smagsnoter af noget diskret koriander. Middel bitterhed med lille til middel sødme. 
Lidt kraftig karboneret, men det kan afhjælpes med lidt ""stirring"". Ellers frisk og lettere blød på samme tid. Olieret konsistens og med en bitter kort afslutning. 
Overall: Dejligt humlet indspark fra Schneider. Hvedeøl kan de jo til perfektion, så denne øl er klart et godt alternativ uden at gå alt for meget på kompromis med hvedeøllets gode egenskaber.

The aroma is amazing: citrus fruits, tangerine, orange peel, yeast that manifests itself as lemon and cloves. Dried fruits, like apricots. Grassy with some black pepper. Apple skins. Im in love with the scent of this beer. Im surprised how tropical it is.

The yeast is a lot more pronounced in the flavor. There is a more earthy presence: dried leaves, some caramel. The hops are bittering/Euro stuff, but complement the esters and dried apricots; a touch of honeydew melon. Some of the barnyard/hay stuff comes out. The malts are bready and biscuity; just a little nutty.

50cl bottle at Mosquito poured into a weizen glass. Murky dark yellow to orange color, majestic offwhite head, nice perfume. So far so good as a weizen usually goes for. Aroma is full of weizen malts, dough, yeast, lightly fruity and spiced and the hops does come out. It has something in common with american IPAs indeed. The taste is very well balanced, malty sweetness and powerful hops. Creamy texture, average carbonation, medium to full body, the finish is also a pleasure.

Nice head, disappeared quite quickly but nice lacing. Looks thick and rich: some yeast is visible and floating in the beer. Lovely. 

Taste is rich and chewy. You can tell it's got more alcohol than a normal Weizen. But really a nice sweet rich toffee banana taste and texture: it almost feels like its coating on your tongue. With a kick of bitter and almost ale like hops it ends off beautifully.

Looks: Cloudy hazy golden honey colour with a ring of dirt-like yeast sediments; One finger head with white foam which lasted for 2 minutes; Very good sticky lacing and fizzy small carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragment malt, with strong banana, strong vanilla, light pineapples, strong honey, fairly strong wheaty tartness, caramel, light toffee, sugar, strong cloves, spices, bread, strong yeast, light lemon and strong grass.

Taste: Mid to light sweet strong malt, with caramel, floral, strong wheaty tartness, strong molasses, strong phenolic, cloves, strong spices, strong yeast, lemon, strong bitter hops and very sharp grass.

Body: Close to medium body. Thick and smooth palate.

Mouth Feel: Strong maltyness in a rich and smooth background. Strong wheat and tartness. Fruity ester is close to minimal, but malty caramel and floral hops taste abound. Lots of nice sweetness and clovey spices. Not as yesty as most Hefeweiss, but good lemon to round. Very nice!

Hoppiness: Light floral, strong honey, spices, lemon and grass in nose. Much the same but with much stronger grass in taste. Bitterness is strong for a lasting, high astringent bitter sweet finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Rich and strong bitter to mouth.

Comments: After Tap 1s disappointment, this organic Tap 4 really kickass: rich smooth body, strong maltyness, big sweetness and strong Cascade hoppiness in floral and bitter grass. Only a couple steps from being a nice Weizenbock, we need strong Hefeweiss like this one. Lovely!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

OK, this one is probably way too old. My defence is, it took some research to puzzle out the date code. (Two lines:12.145 3, and 0227 2724. Im guessing its a Julian code for the 145th day of 2012.) So, Im guessing its more than three years old - way too old for the style. I considered not reviewing it, but screw it: if youre not gonna put a human readable date code on your bottle, thats your decision, live with the consequences.

1697,"2015-01-17",3.5,"Schneiders regular hefeweizen (TAP 7) is one of my all-time favorite examples of the style. From what I can tell, Weisen Edel-Weisse (TAP 4) appears to be more or less the same recipe, but brewed with all-organic ingredients. Maybe because its organic or maybe its because this bottle was about five months old at the time, but this beer isnt as good as the regular edition. Not that its bad, in fact, its got all the things I prefer in the style, just not as strong as Id prefer.

I poured a 500ml bottle into a weizen glass. It was bottled on 8/2/14 and cost $4.29 ($0.25 per ounce).

Appearance: Dark golden hue; only slightly hazy (due to the age of the bottle, a lot of the yeast was caked to the bottom of the bottle). Plenty of visible spastic carbonation. Pours to a large, white, foamy head which retains well but doesnt leave much lacing.

Smell: Milder than most, with the standard banana bread aroma, though it seems to have more of a spice character than usually found in the style.

Taste: The best way to describe the palette here would be to picture a typical authentic German hefeweizen and then weaken it a little. Id probably chalk the mildness up to the fact the bottle was rather old at the time. Id like to think a fresher serving would be much more robust. Also, instead of relying heavily on the banana character from the yeast esters, it ops for Noble hop spice. Theres notes of lemonpeel or saison-like black pepper, which is nice, but its still too mild. Whats interesting about this brew is that its actually made with Cascade hops  an American varietal. They seem to impart a subtle grassy character to the beer, but dont do much in the way of bitterness or piney flavor (nor should they considering the style). Overall, this is a fine brew, but this brewery makes better examples of the style.

Drinkability: Schneider Weisen Edel-Weisse is refreshing while in the mouth, and finishes clean, which is nice. Though it should have much more body and robustness for a beer with a 6.2% ABV. This drinks and feels like something much more overtly sessionable. In fact, the thinness of the body and the mildness of the palette is a bit distracting, honestly. Still, its an easy beer to drink and a single serving is satisfying.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

500 ml bottle [BBE: 2015.08.14] 
Blood alc: 0 

Pours hazy Amber with a very white head of medium Fine bubbles. The Big coriander and spice whiff promises excitement. Flavour is slightly sweet with a tangy background and overall ?raw? flavour which works perfectly with the sweetness. The hop bitterness is unshy, although only as present as would be ideal and balances the sweet malty character perfectly. The end brings a lingering banana and fruit taste with hints of toffee which is most welcome and even maybe more pleasant, as it?s so gentle, than when the beer is actually on the tongue. 
I just can?t really fault this as it?s a fantastic example of it?s style and shouldn?t really be any different. The only reason it doesn?t get 100% is because it?s not as exciting as my perfect, unrivallable beer would be.

1697,"2014-04-23",3.7,"Kaatuu lasiin samean kullankeltaisena, muhkealla vaahtomatolla, kuten tyyliin kuuluukin. Hajussa on hyvin vahvaa banaania, sekä tuoreempaa että hieman ylikypsää. Myös mausteisuutta (pippuri, neilikka) ja sitruunaa on reilusti mukana. Hennosti hedelmäpurkkaakin löytyy, mutta se jää vähän jalkoihin. Maku on sitruksisempi kuin haju, mutta myös reilusti banaanimaisia aromeja on joukossa. Mausteisuutta löytyy vasta jälkimussa, kuten hedelmätoffeetakin. Viljainen pureskeltavuus jää lopuksi suuhun vellomaan. Suutuntuma on raikas ja hiilihappoinen, vehnäisen pureskeltava. Hieno vehnis, raikas ja tasapainoinen.

Citrus lemon notes upfront with plenty of wheat, yeast and coriander as always with this style of beer. There is some lively orange zest and some banana too although this quite faint and definitely not as strong as with some other German hefeweizens and there is some spice right at the end. 

Cloudy yellow to amber with a 2-fingers tall, white and foamy head that has great retention, leaving some nice lacing too.

Wheat and light coriander to begin along with some banana that comes across stronger than it did with the aroma. There is some light spice coming through along with some citrus flavours and a slightly floral taste and the tiniest hint of alcohol right at the end as well.

Medium bodied and soft with a very smooth feel with good carbonation and a touch of fizz. Touches of creaminess and very easy to drink.

Very spicy nose, the cloves going into full-blowh Sezhuan pepper here, along with fragrant meadow grasses, Alpine flowers, near lavender. That DE Cascade really only surfaces in a dry lemon melissa note amongst the clovey apple juice of its base.

Aroma: The nose is rather yeasty, with some wheat, cloves, and spice.

Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy orange color with a foamy white head and waves of lace.  The lace is kind of odd.  It looks sort of like waves on the side of the glass, and seems dissimilar to any other lace I can recall.  

Flavor: It tastes similar to the nose, it is medium sweet, lightly bitter, and it has a spice component.

Palate: The body is light-medium, the carbonation is somewhat fizzy, and the finish is refreshing and clean.

Nose: doughy and yeasty. Its alive!! Raw dough in the midst of kneading. White breads, Italian breads, Hawaiian breads. Nutmeg sprinkles and dust. Raw grains golden in the field. Flower petals rest gently in the back; sunflower. Grains of paradise, white pepper. Touch of greenness and the essence of life.

Palate: living beer is a thing of beauty. Light and bready, she practically dances across my tastebuds. Soft with an airy presence which magically exudes a flavorful personality. Yeasty and fresh doughy breads of artisan quality. Wheat. Spice tickles in the back along with yeast; nutmeg, white pepper, grains of paradise. Flower petals linger in the breath along with a green herbal essence, nondescript. Dough of breads minus the crust. Uber softness abounds. Spice slowly permeates rest of palate.

Appearance: The body has a yellowish tan body which is cloudy. On top of the beer sits a tall creamy white head. It fades out quickly and leaves just a small ring of foam at the edge. Lacing is minimal and slick.

Smell: Its aroma is citrusy, bready, wheat like and very fruity like over an ripe banana.

Taste/Palate: It has a good medium body with some mild bready malt sweetness and wheat tang mixed with spicy almost nutty yeast. This is all in good balance with a very light touch of citrus and spicy hops. The palate is smooth with plenty of soft carbonation to keep it easy drinking.

1697,"2010-05-21",3.7,"Lovely beer. I thought it was supposed to be basically a filtered version of their Schneider-Weisse. I assume it is not, considering the organic tags. Flavour is very similar, lots of wheat and fresh grass with some citrus carrying over from the aroma. Not as banana-y as expected. The most interesting part is how the cascade hops affect the beer. And, Its a great combination. Very crisp, tasty, and the alcohol is barely noticeable. A great addition for the summer lineup.","Southampton, Ontario, CANADA","Crockett"

Flavour starts out with some sweet malt and banana esters, followed by dry yeast and a peppery biting aspect in the finish which is a little strong. Mild citrusy character to the aftertaste. Pretty enjoyable, though not particularly distinct from other good Hefeweizens. Cool label from a really solid brewery, and Im glad I could finally try it, though it would serve us better as a part of the summer release (although, maybe that explains the pathetically late arrival?

1697,"2009-07-23",3.5,"11 ounce goblet - $5.75 at Taco Mac in Buford, Georgia.

Appearance: Arrived a lightly hazed, golden body with a half inch of dense, lasting, white foam.

Smell: Floral, earthy, pithy notes well ahead of the more subtle sniffs of malted wheat, clove, and banana.

Taste: Initial taste of light pale malts and wheat malt with its characteristic tanginess. Lightly sweet. Limited hints of banana and clove spice. Earthy, floral, citrusy hops with a particularly bold bitterness. The citrus comes across as a flavor of powderized lemon pith and yields a bit of a citric jolt. Finishes dry with a lingering bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-high carbonation. Regrettably, for me it doesnt exhibit the fullness, the pleasant creaminess you get with many hefes.

Drinkability: With its diminished banana and clove qualities, the elevated bitterness, and understated body, well, it fell flat with me. However, oddly enough, their Hopfen-Weisse really resonated with me. Ah well!","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

A rather dry wizen with a hoppier presence than most, and much more restrained phenolic character (clove-bannana).  Smells of wheat, toast and slight peppers and bubblegum.  The mouthfeel is slightly acidic, dry and tastes of grains, biscuit and grass, with slight clove. Finish is slightly citrus-lemony.  Delicious.","San Francisco, California, USA","ryanknock"

This beer had a whole bunch of floaties all suspended in the beer, it was a hazy straw color with a fluffy white head. For all the yeast that seems to be in this thing it tastes fairly clean. The taste is initially very earthy and a little soap like. This reminds me a little of a Kristal but the sweetness is very well under control.

1697,"2008-08-24",3.8,"At this point I can safely approach any bottle of beer from Schneider & Sohn brewery and know it’ll be good.  In a statistical stick to quality and enjoyable beers, the Weisen Edel-Weiss is a refreshingly new and delicious beer.  A thick, light tan head wells up during the pour, acting as a flimsy bastion for the roiling rapids of carbonation underneath in the light bronze liquid.  The aroma is light and slightly cheesy, paired with a delicate honey sweetness.  I also catch whiffs of leather and heavy cream, and an aroma of dry, overripe banana; the kind destined for a blender and a smoothie.  Prepare for a disparity in the flavor, where a strange blend of sweet and dry makes for the refreshing experience.  A smooth and creamly palate, a honey taste, a sprinkling of nuttiness, and a gleefully unique aftertaste of fresh tortilla chips.  It’s really the aftertaste that makes this one.  I’m hopelessly addicted to fresh tortilla chips, and here’s a beer that duplicates their flavor faithfully in a beer aftertaste.  Brilliant.  This is incredible spring drinking, and would seem suitable with a light meal or appetizer.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Some clove spice, yeast, and a touch of caramel. Flavor is similar. Slightly sweet wheats with a touch of caramel, a decent citrus note, lots of banana, a light clove spice throughout, and a bit of a yeastiness.

1697,"2008-06-17",2.7,"Gusher! The half-liter bottle oveflows immediately upon opening; in my glass, the explosive froth settles into a pale amber liquid, murky with floaties and overzealous carbonation. Head retention: zero. Pleasing musky aromas of chamomille and bubblegum wrapper, lemon, bread dough, and flowers. The taste starts as a cointoss between spice and candyish honeyed plum  and savory flavors win as the beer finishes with spiced pumpkin pie phenols. Nearly banana-less, and featuring a refreshing, though brief, tartness. Oddly, as carbonation wanes, so do the interesting flavors, leaving only a thin, reedy citric sensation. The lifeless, watery palate is oily with an almost chalky friction.  If any other aspect of this beer were as good as the aroma, it would kick ass.

Smells of banana, orange, cloves, wheat and flowers.  It has a very nice, light and carbonated mouthfeel.  Its a pretty complex beer, I could pick up lots of different notes but it seemed to be dominated by citrus, bananas, cloves and slight hop and alcohol presence.

Definitely not too heavy or overly sedimented. Lively and zesty with citrus notes popping out. Typical Hefe flavors, bananas and cloves, but so much more. Dry bitter pine hop finish. Ever so slight alcohol burn at the back of the throat. Vanilla and pepper. Cloying sweetness that holds the bitter burn! Yep, this is good.

1697,"2008-03-23",3.5,"This weizen beer has a pretty good wallop, 6.2 % alcohol.  It is spicier than most weizens with a complex group of esters, none dominating like the banana or citrus that characterize so many.  It is a pretty good weizen but not the best of the Bavarians.  I would definitely buy it again.Earlier Rating: 3/2/2008 Total Score: 3.7Unlike most German weizens this one has a hint of bitterness.  It is full of the fruity esters characteristic of its type.

So is the yeast and yogurt smells but there is also papaya and even citrus. That pineapple aromas might be due to the somewhat surprising addition of organic Cascade hops. The palate on this baby is superb. It bursts in the mouth then subsides for easy sipping. Creamy, soft, and playful. Flavors are all in the right place at the right time.

I was surprised when this single stream of bubbles eventually created an additional ""secondary"" head through the slow accumulation of bubbles.  This was quite odd--Ive never seen anything like it before.  This ""secondary head"" was made up of ultra-fine bubbles and it lasted throughout the life of the beer.  The flavors were predominantly on the wheat/yeast end of the spectrum.  Less of the fruity/citrusy/spicy flavors.  There was actually even a slight (very slight) hoppiness to the brew.  I enjoyed this beer thoroughly, as I do with most German Hefeweizens.  Id drink it again and again.  And its organic, thats a bonus in my book.","San Diego, California, USA","DarkMagus"

Somewhat tangy, fizzy carbonation with a little more bitterness than what I usually get with a hefe.  The carbonation is just a little to sharp and detracts from the flavors.

How: Bottle 500ml, consumed relatively fresh the day of purchase (as fresh as it can be in North-America)
The look: Cloudy yellow-orange body topped by a persistent small white head
In long: Nose is typical hefe-yeast bananas with spicy notes of cloves and ginger.  Taste is very crisp, plenty of wheat, sun dried yellowed hay, dry staws, fresh bananas, cloves, ginger.  Carbonation is very active.  Compared to the German big top-3 most distributed quality examples of the style (Franziskaner Hefe-Weissbier, Paulaner Hefe-Weissbier, Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier) Id say that this one is more on the spicy side.

Slight citric acidity into the finish.  Late bitterness as well.  As it warms, some peppery notes seem to come forward and the balance goes a little out of whack.

Schneider Wiesen Edel-Weisse.  
Bottle.  
The first thing about this beer that *really* stands out is the lack of head for a weisse.  Ive poured it into my tall wheat glass; this glass has plenty of head space for wheat beers, and I almost always need it since theyre usually so expansive.  But this one had large, clear-ish bubbles that quickly and loudly (ok, relatively loudly) popped, leaving nothing but a thin layer of white on the surface.  
The flavors are pretty classic, though: bubble-gum, a little clove, fruity yeast esters.  This could be the kid-sister of the Aventinus  good, promising, but lighter all around (and not world-class).

Medium-full bodied, not sticky per se, but getting there, but the spices and good carbonation really help to keep this beer lively on the palate.

The body of beer a clean hazy gold with only the lightest amount of fine carbonation popping to the surface.  Subtle spicy and grainy nose, sweet bubblegum and overly ripe bananas with a little note of tangy fruit. The aroma was quite pleasant but lacked the oomph of a good hefe, as did the flavour. Thin, watery body, light and spritzy in carbonation, it had an odd plastic feel mid-palate and a light lactic and gluggy feel in the back of the mouth, before finishing off with a short herbal and sweet swallow. Flavours were subtle with only a little of the normal bubblegum and clove-like phenols and fruity esters associated with a good example of the style. A little disappointed as I thought this may top the Weihenstephan and Spaten offerings, but it just lacked in all aspects. May be the higher alcohol content to blame for its lack of body and flavour.

Once poured it is a glowing yellow that is easy visible through and has a slight sediment and dust cloud. In the drink i found a slight chance of banana and bubblegum as well as clove, but it was weak and hard to find behind a watery and malt flavor.

Fresh, light fruity aroma, much different than most hefes not the traditional banana, more like nectarines and white grapes. Refreshing carbonation - not overdone. Mellow hefe flavor, not as estery as most hefes, a nice change. More lemon-lime like - not too different from a vodka tonic in some senses! Pick up a bit of yeast in the finish.

Lightest colored Schneider I've had so far.  Large head due to swirling to get all the yeast out, but it's already gone as I write this.  Toasted light bread and wheaty malts.  Light flowery hops.  Doughy yeast.  I smell some banana esters, but the fruit overtones smell most like apples to me.  Fairly sweet throughout with a step up in acidity and bitterness at the end.  Bitterness at the beggining has an interesting sour apple quality to it.  Finish feels a little unclean, but that's probably due to the acidity and how smooth this beer starts out.  Medium body has a watery texture and soft carbonation.  There's really a lot of interesting light fruit flavors present in this beer.  Looking at the other ratings, I'm obviously crazy for detecting this fruitiness; but I already knew that.

Flavor is spicy and spruce like, all most like Orval with bannana in the place of the brett character. Really drys out the back of the throat, scratching it all most. Still, I find this beer unique, and it makes a nice (ocasional) alternative to regular hefe-weiss...","Portland, Oregon, USA","Perkeo"
1697,"2003-05-01",3.9,"Aroma is dominated by wheat malts and banana.  Also noticeable is a yeasty smell.  Colour is hazy and light yellow, very straw like.  Head is huge, white and frothy with great lacing.  Starts off with strong banana flavour and then gets a dry hoppy taste before ending with a tangy sweet citrusy finish.  This beer reminds me of a mix between a Belgian strong and a wheat beer.  A nice balance relates to a nice and enjoyable beer.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","BeerPrince"
1697,"2003-04-10",3.7,"Color a hazy light yellow-gold---frothy white head and thick honeycomb lace...Aroma lightly yeasty with signature wheat malt sweet & sour nose...Banana tones punctuate sweet malt front, with hop dryness and mild yeasty tang close in tow---carbonation in just enough quantity to add spritely touches.  Finish has ghostly lemon traces and is nicely dry. More than adequate body anchors brew that has substance, variety of flavor and texture, and fine balance.  This is a solid all-around performer.","Des Moines, Washington, USA","KingPinHead"
1697,"2003-04-05",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2008 Mild banana malt aroma with large pure white head. Hazy due to bottle conditioned yeast aspect. Nice hop bite with a soft rounded middle and somewhat tart lemon notes. Long lingering finish. Excellent!","Thomasville, North Carolina, USA","freekyp"
1697,"2003-03-29",3.5,"Pale yellow hazy color.  Sweet cereal that has been left in the bowl too long nose.  Bitting bitterness and subtle wheat textures.  Fizzy and dry.  Lively and tangy.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
1697,"2003-03-20",3.7,"Light gold color. Medium head. Aroma is malty with a hint of lemon. Medium bodied wheat. Hoppier than normal for a wheat beer. Crisp and clean, dry and light and refreshing. Very drinkable. Touch of lemony flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
1697,"2003-03-13",3.7,"Crisp, clean and refreshing. Smells of fresh picked flowers, the Edel-Weisse is an obvious addition to their weisse recipe. Nice clean gold coloration with a mild head retention. Hops are obvious. Nice and balanced. A clean finish.","Escondido, California, USA","Dougal"
1697,"2003-03-03",3.1,"The head was much larger than some others have described - I don't know what makes the difference.  There is a definite hop taste, with just a bit too bitter a finish.  Otherwise, very good.","Jacksonville, Florida, USA","bob32256"
1697,"2003-02-10",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2004 The color is flaxen with yeasty cloudiness and a thin, white head. The nose is of roasted grains and a slight hint of lemony hops. The palate accentuates the lemony character but retains some light maltiness. The finish is quick and lightly astringent. 

Organic Version: The nose is malty and toasty with an interesting starchy note like stewed rutabaga or mango. Perfumed notes of clover honey. The plate is yeasty, bready and honeyed. Toward the finish, light lemon zest appears. The finish is rich and creamy.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","mickblueeyes"
1697,"2003-01-31",3.6,"Much hoppier than any other german wheat I've had. The hops are present in the aroma, as well as the flavor. A bit more strength than most other hefe-weizens too. Definitely a hoppier example of the style, but the fruitiness is still present. A little of the classic banana/clove but with some citrus tones. Almost no head. Tettnanger hops would be my guess.","Seattle, Washington, USA","foduck"
1697,"2003-01-26",3.1,"This beer poured a pale gold color and formed a nice foamy white head that retained and left circular lace. A good deal of carbonation was present and probably helped account for the nice head. Some sediment was present as well. It had an aroma of citrus, clove and bannana. The flavor was of citrus and grain. The body was very light and the finish slightly tart. Not bad, but there are better ones out there.","Ohio, USA","Gunshy"
1697,"2003-01-14",2.6,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2003  

Quick fizzy dusty white foam.  Unrefined aroma mostly showing lemon zest, clove, coconut, vanilla, pepper, light phenols, and leafy hops.  Lacking estery qualities, which I love, complexity,  and sharpness.  Watery palate; smooth carbonation level.  Predictable flavors of light citric notes, vanilla, bread, cilantro, and very sloppy malts and cardboard.  Zero depth while displaying only the slightest sign of leafy hop.  Too much yeastinesss and acidity interferes.  Finishes with abundant dry mint, clove, artificial sweetener and a touch of phenol.  Surprisingly disppointing, and only slightly better than a good American Wheat.  Note:  Extremely fresh bottle.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1697,"2003-01-08",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2004 Terribly drinkable.  Nose of bananas cloves and fruit.  Oh so smooth a sweet.  Very nice, bubblegum and cloves all the way, finishes dry and crisp.

1697,"2002-12-31",4.5,"Opaque. More so than Guinness, although certainly not the same color. A great deal of head. Probably one of the best Bavarian wheats Ive had, almost a Perfect Abstraction of the Hefeweizen.","Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, USA","Admiral"

1697,"2002-10-30",3.3,"Foam poured out before I had a chance to pour it.  When I got it into the glass, I was left with a cloudy yellow body with a big white head.  Aroma is wheat, clove, banana and lemon.  Flavor is milder than Id expect, almost nothing up front, with wheat and citric showing up around mid-tongue and staying into the swallow.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
1697,"2002-10-30",3.6,"Dissapointing head - too thin and sudsy, although it is large on pouring. Body is good - light in colour but very opaque. Nice, friuty, spicy, hoppy aroma.

1697,"2002-09-26",3.6,"Wheat, malt aroma, cloudy golden, large off white head, lots of bubbles. Light wheat flavour, terrific bitterness. Bounces off the tongue, loads of carbonation.

1697,"2002-08-25",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2007 Cloudyish with an aroma that is wheat dominant, but also showcases esters, cloves, and banana.

1697,"2002-07-14",3.8,"Just an overall superbly crafted beer. Lemony banana sour wheat in the nose perfectly mirrored in the flavor.

1697,"2002-06-24",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2005 Deep hazy golden color.  Wheat malt and citrus aroma.  Very effervescent.   Surprisingly strong wheat-malt and malt flavors, mixed with some tangy citrusiness, spices and light hops.  Heavier body than your typical hefe.  Finish is clean, dry, refreshing, and malty.  For an authentic German Hefe Weizen, this is certainly a bigger and more complex beer than most of its kind that Ive sampled.  Quite a good beer.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

1697,"2002-05-01",3.3,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2008 What a great special Weiss.  The mix of a hefe with the yeast of a belgium strong.  An acquired taste but the yeast it is with this one.   Ok another rerate ala leap year. I hope Weissbierbrauerei G. Schneider & Sohn does not take too much of a hit, as they die have 4 in my top ten and one has already left the scene to the near 4+ range. I will state that the first time I had this one, I literary went back out and bought the remaining stock - so it was 18 bottle, Someone else and I had purchased the other two bottles from the one case that the store had received. Once again time is not necessarily a friend to this one. A fresh bottle was much different. I am now stuck in a spot, do I leave my rate of yore, or do I rate what others have likely had. I think I will go with middle ground. All I will say is old bottles of this suck. I hope you find new bottles when you find this. This does not age nearly as well as Aventinus. I hope to find fresh bottles again.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1697,"2002-04-21",3.2,"A good but not great wheat, had a lot of fruitiness to it some hints of bannana that I realy liked. It was a little too vinegary and sour, but not overwhelmingly so. Hides the 6.2% prety well.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","ToadMan"
1697,"2002-04-08",3.0,"Didnt know what to expect from this brewer.  Typical German wheat appearance---nice thick head, hazy golden color---though much more yeast particles floating around, not to mention the mud at the bottom of the bottle.  Not alot of aroma though, which was a bit disappointing.  The taste is grainy, with a hint of banana and spice but again not as much as I would expect, considering this IS a German wheat.  The taste soured quickly to me, though not in the cheap beer way, but sour nonetheless.  My mouth is still sour, in fact.  So, it may be true to the style, but it doesnt finish as well as others Ive tried.  Too watery and lemony and/or acidic for my liking.  That taste just didnt blend well with all the yeast in the brew.  It isnt bad, just not my favorite German wheat.","Sherman, Texas, USA","unixweb"
1697,"2002-03-26",3.3,"Hazy copper color with an average sized white head that diminishes quickly.  Aromas of yeast over a backdrop of noble hops.  Flavors are interesting.

A good Weisse, but not their best product.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"
1697,"2002-02-02",3.3,"UPDATED: NOV 23, 2004 Head is initially average sized, fizzy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy dark yellow, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (cookie, toasted grain), moderately hoppy (flowers), moderately yeasty (cobwebs, mold), with strong notes of banana and clove. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, heavily bitter, slightly husky. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Newer bottle with the organic crap all over it.  Seems that organic beers are often grainy, and only sometimes great (my experience with Pinkus-Mueller has been the same...when theyre on, theyre great, otherwise, not very good at all).  This is a grainy example.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Nose is earthy, with lots of sweet malt, citrus crisp and clean to the senses; start is sweet and has a nice grain profile, the top middling in feel.
