Wew, quite a impact at first, seemed a little bitter for a fest but after the session continued, it got a little better. Decent co2, yes, cleans up after you drink it for a while.

2221,"2012-03-17",3.7,"22 ounce bottle.  This just showed up at a local beer store recently for $1.99 a bomber, and I have no idea how old this bottle is.  However, the label on the bottle is different than the one shown on BA for this brew, and the label lettering/design does look more like what Buckeye has been using on some of their other bottles lately so hopefully its a new batch of this beer.  Served in a mug, the beer pours a slightly hazy orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both good.  Aroma is nice, it smells like bready and caramel malt, grassy and herbal hops, and a bit of apple.  Taste is similar to the aroma, with it tasting like bready and caramel malt, along with some grassy and herbal hops.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit slick and sticky with good carbonation.  I think this is a solid overall brew, and for just $1.99 Id buy this again in the future.  Definitely worth a try at that price.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

Reddish-copper pour with a fizzy, light tan head and spots of lacing. Aroma is extremely sweet and nutty with an abundance of noble hops, honey, and wheat bread. Firm and smooth to the gullet, great malty body that is very clean. Ah yes, this is so good this time of year. Oktoberfest’s rarely let me down, but very few actually wow me and this one got my attention. Hearty fresh harvest taste that is malty and lightly sweetened with grains and honey.

Almost has a bit of a stale beer smell to it... like that bottle you find half full a week later.  In spite of that, this beer has a surprisingly thin texture... I thought I would be drowning in syrupy malt sweetness, but there are vast holes in the palate development where virtually nothing is going on.  Right off the bat, nothing... then slowly a bit of caramel maltiness and then-wait for it-then a bit of a hops spiciness finishes things off...  Completely underwhelming...","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
2221,"2004-06-21",3.9,"Bottled.  Poured a smallish frothy ecru colored head with fair lacing. Nice clear reddish amber color.  Distinct matly aroma with hints of plum and and red apple.  Started with a firm hit of sweet caramel malt that revealed subtle plum and red apple flavors by mid-palate.  Pleasant yeasty-bready character along with a very present hop bitterness appeared toward the finish and lasted into the aftertaste.  Medium to full body with a fairly lively carbonation made for a refreshing quaff.  A very nice American Midwest interpretation of a Southern German classic.  I would have liked a gentler hop bitterness in the finish so the plum-apple character came through more. I would definitely have this brew as a regular in my fridge.Danke Schoen herr Froning!","San Francisco, California, USA","Flipbrewer"

Rating # 445
 Pours a very dark amber / mahogany body, with a fluffy kaki colored head towering out of the glass. The aroma is sweet and malty. Notes of toasted wheat bread lathered in honey are provoking memories of my childhood. The flavor brings toasty caramel malts to no end. Its syrupy sweet like fresh pound cake, but with a little lemony / orange zest bite in the lingering finish. Large fruity suggestions are everlasting, apple, apricots, plums, and nectarines Finish is crisp and dry Great Marzen!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
2221,"2004-04-09",3.7,"Light amber color with a small beige head. Aroma is sweet and malty with some candy notes. Flavor of caramel, toffee, fruit and hops. Much hoppier than other beers of this style.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Darkover"
2221,"2004-03-19",3.6,"Pours a dark rich copper with a thin off-white head.  Aroma of European hops, sweet caramel malt and toffee.  Body starts with an almost syrupy caramel sweetness and a more mild hoppiness with a crisp, sweet lager finish.  Very flavorful and well-balanced.  An enjoyable märzen, thanks Drew!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
2221,"2004-02-22",4.1,"Ruby/brown color,small tan head that faded fast but left a nice lace behind.The aroma was very nice,malty and sweet caramel with a light hint of hops.The flavor was much better with a decent malt up front then a quick change to sweet caramel maybe a little chocolate and a nice hop presence.This brew is really flavorful with a nice balance between the sweet and the hops.Which IMO makes this one hell of a nice brew.I also detect a small amount of orange in the flavor as this brew warms up,but it mostly seems to make itself known in the after taste.Thanks go to Drew for sending another winner my way.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
2221,"2004-01-29",3.0,"YEAY, finally, I found some more brews from Buckeye.

NICE dark amber brown- small head.

Nice, sweet smelling, maybe appley-- but probably not. I keep smelling apples tonight. Huh.

Kinda dirty taste. Not really what I expected (or wanted). Kinda funky, and not overly pleasant.

They can do better.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","hershiser2"
2221,"2003-11-18",3.1,"Reddish color to it.  Has a hoppy and almost mild aroma on it with a basically skunky malt feel to the body.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
2221,"2003-11-12",3.6,"The clear amber body of this brew is topped by a medium thick head with a decent amount of lacing left behind.  The flavor and aroma are quite different than any other marzen I've tried.  They are slightly sweet and fruity with candy notes and a slight maltiness.  Light to medium bodied, smooth and slightly dry.","San Diego, California, USA","Vac"
2221,"2003-11-10",3.5,"Thanks alcfron, this is a pretty enjoyable O'fest. Nice and malty w/ good amber color.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
2221,"2003-09-06",3.7,"Ruby red out of the bottle with a beige head and a malty, sweet nose.  Caramel sweetness with a clean finish.  Very enjoyable beer.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
2221,"2003-09-01",3.2,"Red hue with some head and good lacing. Aroma hinted of mild fruity hops, apricot, toasted caramel malt, and milk chocolate. Sweet initial taste leds to a slightly bitter and acidic finish. Hint of butter. Medium-bodied with a lively and soft mouthfeel. Nice and quaffable brew, works well during the summertime.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
2221,"2003-09-01",3.8,"8/27/03:  bottle.    reddish-brown body.  sour malt, alcohol and tea nose.  to taste there are flavors of malt, alcohol, some tea and some sourness.  towards the end there is also evidence of orange peel and spice.  tasty stuff.  love the label, killer tongue.","cow- lumbus, Ohio, USA","edden"
2221,"2003-08-30",3.9,"This beer has a very deep red/amber color, little head or carbonation and a touch of sweet malt aroma.  Sticky caramel flavor that borders on being too sweet, but just manages to avoid it.  Enjoyable beer.","Rochester, New York, USA","JahNoth"
2221,"2003-08-27",3.7,"Dark red body with a thin tan head. No lacing.
Sweet malty aroma. Very German aroma.
Munich malt is evident. Hops are present but subdued. You can almost coax the pilsner malt out with the bitter. The flavors line up nicely.
Full bodied, lager smoothness, slightly thick but not unpleasent mouthfeel. Low carbonation.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bender"
2221,"2003-04-28",4.0,"Great hops and Germanic malt in the nose.  One of the best aromas I've encounted in Marzen.  Sweet, comprehensively drinkable Marzen that I'd like to slug all day.  Extremely fun.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"
2221,"2003-04-20",3.4,"Tan slightly dissipating head.  nice caramel color.  This beer tastes much better than it looks.  Sweet malty flavor.  Smooth finish.  A great tasting Marzen.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","LiebeBier"
2221,"2003-04-13",3.5,"I'm real sensitive to too much sweetness in an Octoberfest, and I thought this one walked the fine line of adequate bittering and traditional caramel malt sweetness. Quite good; clear as a bell, moderate on the palate. Thanks, Drew.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
2221,"2003-04-13",3.3,"(Draft) Satisfying Marchbier with excellent clarity and a deep golden and red hue. The flavor is almost fruity - there's plenty of body here,  malts with a trace of must at the finish. Not overly striking in appearance, but has decent consistency, and the head lingers well. Buckeye's illustration for this beer is one of my favorites, but the beer itself is merely good.","Renton, Washington, USA","deprogram"
2221,"2003-04-05",3.2,"Off white head, does not last very long, but laces quite nicely.  Typical Amber color of a Marzen w/ brilliant clarity.  Munich Malty aroma w/ a little hop which seems slighly out of character for O'fest.  Slight raisin aroma but other fruity aromas non existant.  Malty first sip and very slight raisin malty flavor leads to hoppy bitterness and flavor in the finish; unexpected from a Marzen style. I expect a malty finish, not hoppy bitter. Mildy carbonated and light medium body.  Should finish more malty and needs to tone down the bitterness for marzen style. Not a world classic but very, very drinkable.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"
2221,"2003-01-24",2.2,"Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy dark amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is lightly malty
(caramel, toasted grain, cereal), lightly hoppy (flowers), with a light
note of peach. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly
bitter. Finish is moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body,
watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately astringent, metallic. The
very weak aroma, fairly high acidity and astringency, and disturbing
metallic coating on the tongue make this one extremely disappointing.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2221,"2003-01-18",3.1,"Im not a big fan of lagers, but this one is certainly not bad.  Nice brownish-orange color, and white head.  The aroma is nothing interesting, but not bad.  Flavor is not overpowering and has a nice malt flavor, but something doesnt sit right with me.  Maybe its just the fact that it doesnt have a lasting flavor, at all.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"
2221,"2002-12-26",3.6,"Dark amber orange pour, medium sticky head.  This was a bit sweet for my taste.  The sweetness made it seem thicker than it really was. Definitely a good flavor, however, it would take me forever to finish the whole bottle.","Lewis Center, Ohio, USA","bluemeow76"
2221,"2002-12-26",3.7,"Thanks to alcfron for this otherwordly 22oz Marzen. I wonder if it is so named because of the color? It isnt much of a stretch to say this beer is ""Mars-colored"" orangish-red. Medium-thick off-white head that lingered, and decent lacing. Sweet caramel malt aroma. Slick and sweet flavor of malt that threatens to become too much, but luckily there is enough hops finish to keep it from being too sticky-sweet. Another decent beer from Buckeye.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
2221,"2002-12-20",4.0,"The foam is very limited to a slight ring of lace.  No stick, and very artificial looking large bubbles.  Rather nice aroma;  simple, yet classy.  Loaded with berries, minerals, toast, caramel, and a hint of nuttiness.  Crisp flavors engulf the palate with nuts, toast, perfume, medicine, and a subtle finishing hop snap, which manages to display an uncharacteristic short note of pineapple.  This sits a bit sharply on the palate:  Maybe due to the seemingly forced carbonation?  Note:  Hallertaus are arguably my favorite hop in this style, and, perhaps, a tad more emphasis on them would have made the finish a bit more quaffable and balanced.  Furthermore, it would have added to the complexity.  Thumbs up to this excellent ale producing brewery to dish out such a moderately complex and tasty lager!  Cheers, alcfron!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2221,"2002-11-24",3.6,"Has a very nice sweetness to it, but not too much of it, which is good.   Faint hops atthe finish.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Rockinout"
2221,"2002-08-03",3.3,"Hazy. Deep amber color with orange highlights and a fluffy off-white head that diminishes quickly but holds fairly well. The aroma is of sweetish malt, and a touch of fruitiness - not much hop. The body is medium with a moderate carbonation, leading to a full mouthfeel. The flavor presents sweetish caramel malt with an OK balance. The finish is a little bit sticky, almost candyish, but gives a burst of hops on the way out.","Pennsylvania, USA","NeroFiddled"
2221,"2002-06-25",3.9,"see thru- nut brown colored body, little head.  thick caramel malts veered toward toffee flavor the finish was dry, and the toffee lingered awhile - nicely sweet, but got a tiny bit overwhelming towards the end.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
