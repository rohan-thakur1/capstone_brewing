3415,"2015-03-12",4.1,"Bottle: Weathered & dingy copper color with decent clarity, topped with a musky, gray-tinted head that fades quickly, leaving a tiny collar behind. Aroma includes delicate, sour cherries, drying & slightly spicy oak, faint lacto sourness, moderately vinous red grapes, hints of bramble berries, acidic lemon flesh, cherry skin, & small touch of funky, musty wood on the back-end. Vibrant, fresh, & lovely tart flavor with each sip. Sour apples, tart cherries, acidic grapes, brushed with a mild coating of lactic acid & finished with sharp lemon tartness. Peripheral notes of red wine soaked oak, faint vanilla, toasted malts, a kiss of cinnamon & allspice, modest toffee, & a perfect finishing dryness. One of the best things about this brew is its ability to rub out that sour hard-on you might have, while retaining superior drinkability by delicately playing footsies with the line of ""too acidic, too sour"" but never fully crossing over. Grows more vinous & oaky as it warms, lovely dry fruit skin & vanillin finish. This shit is so good.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

3415,"2014-02-15",4.2,"Pours a nice reddish brown color with a big thick off white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is corky, woody, lightly lemony, with a touch of caramel sweetness, with only a bit of funkiness... It reminds me of a less sugary version of straight up Rodenbach in many respects. 

The flavor is really something, tart and sour with just the lightest touch of balsamic sourness. Its lemony, earthy, woody, but yet rich & lightly sweet. Its got a little bit of caramel thats balanced by the acidity in a way that I yearn for in many of the classic examples of the style. Its got some tart cherry, light under-ripe fruit notes & very light citrus rind. 

Its like all of the things I like about Flemish Brown ales amplified and the things I dont like about them reigned in, not forgotten or dismissed but rather woven to incorporate them in enjoyable ways.

3415,"2013-12-01",3.6,"Bottled June 27, 2013 (~5 months old).
Appearance: The body has a velvety haze with a dark red brick color. The head is short without much retention, but it settles into a soft yet dense light tan coating. A creamy ring is left on the edges.
Aroma: The aroma is pungent with a dill pickle aroma, some cherry surfaces with a wood backing, but I get dill pickle all the way and its making my mouth water.
Taste: This is balanced much better than the aroma indicates. The intro is mildly sweet even with some cherry and caramel noted. Caramel is the base during the mid-taste as the vinegar picks up, tasting like dill pickle juice with a strong earthy wood backing. The finish is strong dill pickle which lingers a moment on the tongue.
Palate: Full bodied with mild carbonation.
Overall: This is a beer unlike any Ive had yet, Ive never had a beer with such a strong dill juice flavor. Its odd, but enjoyable. I dont know the pricing on this, but I would keep a few of these in stock at my house at all times if I could get it here.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

The fact that this is only $8.99 per four pack is a ridiculous deal. While there might be better sours out there none are so cheap as well as top notch. Im excited to see what else Dan Carey can crank out with his sour program in the future. A few new bottles in the on deck collection should give me a better idea.

Aroma / Appearance - A caramel orange head is warm with a thin ivory head. Orange polish, wax, and a mild sourness are tart without being overly acidic. This is not as sour as the fruit series but more like a light vinegar. Whatever you call it the result works well.

Flavor / Palate - Orange, lemons, and waxy floor polish stick on the tongue. A solid sour does not have much depth but does not need it either. The drinkable impression is so good that I almost wanted to open another one immediately. The finish is tart and sour though more like a mild vinegar than a sharp acidic note. Overall this is a fine beer though perhaps a bit below the 750 ml and special brewery only releases.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3415,"2013-09-29",3.8,"12 oz bottle served in a Westbrook tulip. Enjoyed 7/20/13.

A: Pours a deep amber color with a brownish tint to it. An off-white head forms on the pour and recedes to a thin film and ring. Sticky sheets of lace are left down the glass.

S: Sweet berry fruitiness on the nose with some cherry pit as well as a nice dash of oak. Pretty inviting, but not all that sour smelling.

T: The taste is much better than the nose. Cherry skins with some tart plums. There is a mild sourness to it, but its mostly tart. Sweet pie crust on the malts, a little bit of brown sugar and some sweet oak. Mild acidity as well.

M: High carbonation with a medium light body. Finish is sweet.

O: I enjoyed this one more than Enigma. I think this would be the big brother of it. I think this could use some time to let some of the yeast and bugs do their job a bit more. Ill revisit around Christmas time.

3415,"2013-09-25",3.9,"2013 bottle (not sure if previously released).
A fairly herbal phenolic character with some mint, pepper, basil and thyme. Some light acidity along with light caramel, burnt toast and a hint of smokey roast. Faint fruit notes of overripe cherries and figs. 
Pours a somewhat murky burnt amber to light brown with some copper hints. Small, slightly thin head that recedes fairly steadily leaving just a hint of film on the edges. 
Flavor starts with a moderate tartness along with a hint of a yogurt character. Some light sweet caramel along with some toasted bread. Fairly fruity with sweet orange, cherries and figs. Light oak character, but fairly fruity. Some moderate fruit notes very reminiscent of ripe peaches. Not nearly as phenolic as the aroma. 
Medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Light acidic astringency with light alcohol warmth. 
Overall a much better tasting beer than the aroma had me expecting. It took me a few sips to pinpoint the fruit flavor I was tasting, but I am pretty sure this tastes exactly like a slightly overripe peach with some citric and lactic acidity. The herbal notes in the aroma faded as it warmed but was a but off putting at first.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3415,"2013-08-31",3.6,"A steady pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a two-finger thick, tan colored head. The beer is a rich amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, interestingly orange-tinged, bright amber hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells of sour, fermented fruit, followed by an interesting woody note that leans towards a mix of oak and cedar. Bright plum notes, tart berry character, some definite strawberry character, as well as a light toasted woodiness, and perhaps a touch of caramelized cracker character are noticeable in the nose.

Prickly and effervescent, the beer foams up quite a bit during my first sip. This is fairly tart / sour, it has an edge to it that seems to be acetic in character, though this is well constrained, the predominant sourness seems to be from lactic acid; this is fairly smooth overall, and doesnt have the sharp / harsh edge that beers with a fair amount of acetic acid have. This has quite a bit of fruit presence with notes of plum, sour, somewhat floral apple, tart not-quite ripe currants, and even some nectarine like notes towards the finish. The latter is accentuated by a hint of nail polish that can comes out in overly ripe versions of that fruit. This has a backbone of soft, caramelized malt, some toasted whole grain cracker notes, and some light nutty malt character. The body is fairly light, there is some viscosity here, and the beer clings to the palate a bit, though this is nicely balanced by the acidity. Soft woody flavors accentuated the light toasted character, the nutty notes, and perhaps a touch of woody spice character.

This has a nice balance of acetic acid and lactic acidity; the former doesnt overwhelm the flavor profile of this beer, which is an easy flaw. Quite nice and drinkable, assuming you like sour beers, but perhaps a touch simplistic. Still this is a nice mix of fruit and sourness that ends up quite drinkable in the end.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Flavor is fruity and tart up front, lots of tart cherry, berry and tree fruit notes, some funkiness, some lactic and acetic acidity, interesting woody notes, toasted nuts and some ever so faint smokiness. Light body with a medium strength, spritzy, blanketing carbonation, juicy entry and still somewhat juicy, then dry finish with a pleasant acidic bite. Fantastic stuff, reminds me of Old English Porter, but fruitier and with less dark malt/smoke character.

Good god what a great beer, they could ask twice as much for it and I would still buy it.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
3415,"2013-08-02",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2013 Bottle, pours murky brown with medium white head, lacing is about the same. Aroma is a mix of the most recent enigma batch and unplugged apple. Lots of cherry, oak, granny smith, cranberry and vanilla going on. Flavor is ultra tart apple skin, sweet cherry, plum, vinegar, pie crust, and berries. Carbonation is medium and so is the body. Pretty solid","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3415,"2013-08-01",3.6,"Bottle. Pours a mostly clear deep red brown with persistent offwhite head. Nose is Brett with subtle plastic and faint caramel. Cherry and subtle pie spice. On tasting, intense lacto tartness, hop flavor is moderate with spice and caramel sweetness. Odd beer here, but ok.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
3415,"2013-08-01",4.0,"What a fun beer. Beautiful nose. Clear, dark orangish pour, slight white head. Sour nose, more than the taste. Woody and dark fruit notes in the taste - very nice. Light, easily drinkable. Thanks for sharing Caleb!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
3415,"2013-07-31",4.0,"Bottle. Pours is a hazy brown with no head, no carbonation. Aroma is tart dark fruit, cherry/plum. Flavor matches the aroma, really tart but not mouth puckering sour.","Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","TheHOFF43"
3415,"2013-07-31",3.8,"Chill brew served in plastic cup by some chill bros @ camp just then. Pleasant sour brown brew offers notes of brown sugar hint of balsamic touch of cocoa cherries and hazelnuts. Fine.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
3415,"2013-07-31",4.1,"Pours a deep amber color with a light ruby hint. A very bubbly, off white head emerges but quickly subsides. A modest amount of carbonation can be seen cascading to the edges. Aroma has a modest tart cherry nose, light acidic character, some bready notes at the very end. Flavor starts off with a bready kick that moves into a tart, sour cherry flavor. Late brown ale/malt flavors kick in lending a softened toasted presence to the beer. Body is light, very fizzy and lends a fantastic dryness to the tongue at the end of the drink. Overall a very enjoyable beer. I love the bready and brown malt flavors that come through as the sourness isnt the only flavor present. Great Flanders Red-ish sourness.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"

3415,"2013-07-30",3.9,"12 oz bottle from Copps Grocery (Plover, WI). Slim pickens around here.. But found plenty of this. Pours a darker ruby copper pour, a firm haziness throughout, a bit darker, with cakey tannish head. A good ruby copper glow on the edges and bottom. Good stick around, lacing is solid and sticks around ok. Aromas are gentle tartness, a touch carmelized. Bit of oak, cherryskin. A bit lactic, some toast and bread. Cherry element is distinct if decent in the end. Initial is more tart, lactic and sour driven, some gentle cobwebs and dryness, a bit tannic. Some cherries, carmelized malt, a bit of biscuit. A bit more potent than Enigma, a little fizzy with some gentle vinegar, cranberry, and oak. Middle is a bit tart, toast, and red wine. Cherries are potent, a little more body. Fizzy carbonation, firm sourness as we move into the backend starts to seperate this. A bit funky, oaky, and biscuity. Finish is a bit dry, lactic, and a touch spritzy. Some funk, tannic cherry. Really nice. Complex, not all sour, still offers some body. A gentle red wine oaky feel, cherryskin, some gentle body with some spritzy elements, cranberry, red fruit. Really nice beer. A step above recent Enigma versions. Much more fruity and vibrant. Nice, guys! Nose is a touch subtle, but a damn good beer.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3415,"2013-07-29",3.9,"12 oz. bottle shared by TheAlum- thanks again, Adam! It was pretty dark by the time I tried it, but holding it up to the campfire, it appeared to have a golden hue beneath the cloudy amber pour. Small off-white head. Notes of berry fruits (cherries, raspberry), light balsamic vinegar, lemon, tart plums, toasted caramel malts. Dry, sour mouthfeel that isnt overpowering. Moderate carbonation and a light-medium body. Excellent sour. Need more.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3415,"2013-07-28",4.1,"July 28, 2013 - 12 ounce bottle. Light brown pour with nice head that faded after a short while. Aroma was malty, fruity and funky. Taste was consistent with aroma, but also had quite a bit of wood that reminded me of Surly 5. The flavors were very nicely balanced and this is super easy to drink. I am very glad to have a few more of these and will be interested to see how some age.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
3415,"2013-07-28",3.8,"Although sourness is pronounced and appealing, the flavor is a bit close to cider and complexity is limited. This might benefit from laying down as it is a bit one dimensional fresh.","","Lupulucid"
3415,"2013-07-27",4.2,"This is an affordable wild sour ale that is readily available. What are you all waiting for...go get it!! Pours amber yellow with thin lacing. Aroma is heavy with vinegar and almost stings the nose. Taste is quite sour with a continual ringing on the palate. Acidic flavors bite all the way through this one. Love sour beers and love the fact that a real wild sour has finally made it to the local market at a reasonable price with moderate level of availability.","Michigan City, Indiana, USA","swigswthwolves"

3415,"2013-07-27",3.7,"Bottle shared by Dr. Moll. Thanks Michael.

The beer is amber with a small tan head. The aroma offers cherries, funk. Tart and sweet cherries do a delicate dance. Really well done. Graceful finish. Id prefer more sour than sweet here, but the folks at New Glarus obviously feel the opposite. A solid beer. Best in small quantities, as the sweetness would become overwhelming.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
3415,"2013-07-26",4.3,"12 oz. bottle. Pours dark amber ruby slightly hazy with a tight soapy off white head that dissipates to a wispy spotty film and collar. Aroma is sour and has a subtle vinegar scent with cherries, raspberries and cranberry some apple and malt all melded together. Taste is tart and sour with more of the above fruits and solid malt flavor and hints of wine cork and tannins. Palate is medium slightly fizzy and acidic with a drying finish. This is such a great sour! I could possibly pound this, but why? Its smooth not overpowering and the malt mix is awesome!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
3415,"2013-07-25",4.1,"Bottle; Pour is murky caramel with a frothy yet mild fine bubbled off white head in this glass ; Retention is average, with some light lacing present. The nose is sour cherry and green apple initial, moving to vanilla and musty oak, while revealing a nice base of caramel that I quite enjoy. The flavor profile reveals a nice souring effect that I appreciate ; I was expecting less and got more than I bargained for. I called it oak, but the tasting notes say cedar - Either way - Vanilla reveals itself faintly here; Sour cherry and green apple notes fuse with a robust caramel malt profile - and it immediately moves into a nice puckering sour feel that doesnt fade as some do. This is a spectacular drinker, and an amazing price point when you compare to some. What it lacks in depth , be it flavor profile, abv, or mouthfeel, it more than makes up for with its quaffable tartness, thanks to a laser like focus from the brewers -","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
3415,"2013-07-23",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2013 Bottle. Finally, after all the crappy beers I tried tonight, I get a true winner. This is awesome. Rich reddish orange pour with a smaller head. Nose and taste pick up sour plum and cherry, some oak and cedar, a nice sour bite but not over the top puckering. Beautiful beer.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
3415,"2013-07-22",4.1,"Bottled. Poured clear, fiery orange with a tall, sticky beige head.. surprisingly lively for the style. The aroma picked up sour cherries, vinegar, and oak, with more fruits emerging as it warmed up.. lots of funky interesting-ness going on, yet it felt controlled.. really nice! The flavor found moderate-plus cherry and oak sourness over soft, supportive, mostly fruity notes.. finished with cherry skins, dusty leather, and light vinegar. Medium-bodied with fairly full carbonation on the palate.. smooth across the middle.. moderate overall sourness.. this was really good.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3415,"2013-07-21",3.9,"Bottle from Tosa Wine and Spirits brought to the Mom-without-Bill tasting. Aroma is complex with multiple fruit flavors. Tasting suggestions included cranberries, cherries, rhubarb, strawberries, sour apples and mulberries. All in the sour line. Flavor is quite sour and strong, with layers - and malty oak underneath. Perhaps would take the edge away with more aging. Very complex.","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"
3415,"2013-07-20",4.2,"This pours a clear yet dark amber color with a fizzy head. The aroma is very tart with candied fruits and sugars.

3415,"2013-07-19",4.1,"Pours a dirty golden color. There is a small fizzy head that fades real quick. Aroma is tart cherry, oak, and barnyard funk. Mouthfeel is smooth and finishes a bit dry. Taste is a great balance of tart fruit, light lambic sourness, and a hint of funk. Extremely drinkable and a bit lighter and brighter version of the Sour Brown Ale.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Petrucci914"
3415,"2013-07-19",4.4,"Bottle: The aroma consists of cherries, citrus, sour lemon, and just a touch of must. It pours a transparent amber with a small beige head that quicly fades to a thin film outlined by a thicker ring. The flavor starts with a quick dose of sweet/sour cherry. The finish has moderate sour lemon, light sour orange, and a touch of oak. Its medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, a very tasty and refreshing sour. I could drink a ton of this.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3415,"2013-07-19",4.1,"12oz bottle: Pours a clear deep bronze amber with a thin-lacing effervescent froth of off-white head. Has a lightly sweet pale crystal malty nose with notes of black currants and strawberry jam along with fresh vinous oak. Starts with good carbonation and fiullness with a good amount of malty sweetness, fruity character and a nice puckering balance with a drier, lingering oaky finish. True to style and enjoyable. This should age well, but tastes just fine now.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

Taste is bitter, unripe dark fruit, light red wine vinegar tartness. Vanilla and wood on the finish, along with some citrus rind in the back of the mouth. Thin and soft, with ample carbonation.

3415,"2013-07-16",4.4,"All I;ll say is I had it on draft and fuck it. Its fucking good, I know people dont want to give too much hype to this brew but its sour, acidic, tons of oak, really a prototypical flanders. It flat out rocks.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
3415,"2013-07-16",4.0,"12oz bottle split with Anndiesel. Glowing orange body, respectable off-white head. Quite different than I was expecting, there is a real pronounced green plum flavor, sour and and mouth puckering. Very clean, watery malt base lets the sour flavors shine.

Aroma is a crazy mix of cool berries and faintest acetic and nice lactic notes. Its like a weird cranberry and crazyberry (made that up - akin to cran and gose berry mix). There is a sweet and sweaty musky character. Flavor is earthy dirt berry with milky lactic touches. Kind of the oily feel to the beer.

3415,"2013-07-12",4.1,"Light red pour with a slight haze and a compact white lace - nose is equal parts sweet and sour - a lot of nice touches from the oak - vanillins, light tannins, touches of coconut - sweet notes of pie cherries and more acidic notes of apple - light acetic character - the nose is pretty dang awesome - the flavor is more sour than sweet, but has enough malt sweetness to balance moderate acetic and very mild lactic notes - sour apple, semi-tart cherry, light vinegar - mild vanilla and plumy sweetness late before a dry, oaky finish with lingering acidity and a very mild funkiness - closer to a Flanders Red than an Oud Bruin (was hoping for a bruin, but oh well) - a tasty, balanced, and approachable sour - and at nine and change for a four pack, this is a serious deal for a sour ale - I only bought one four pack, but I will have to snag some more before leaving Wisconsin.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
