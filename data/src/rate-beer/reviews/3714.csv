3714,"2017-05-02",3.8,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance was a dark orange almost amber color with a fingers worth of white foamy head that fell off at a good pace. Light stringy lace.
The aroma had some grassy sweet to bitter hops over top of a nice caramel/toffee base malt. Light pomme-like fruits then some bready sweetness. Ends with some toast.
The flavor had a decent blend of toast sweetness to malt sweetness with a touch of leafy to slight low herbal quality. Aftertaste had some nuts, the leafiness and the herbal quality. Pillowy sweet finish.
The feel was almost medium bodied, seemed like it sat just a tad under. I didnt mind as it seemed just where I would want an Irish red ale to sit on my tongue. Carbonation felt good. ABV felt as projected by the brewer.
Overall, whats not to love with this one. Great Lakes did a stellar job with this one and if I lived closer in its distro, I wouldnt mind slamming this one back during St. Paddys Day.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
3714,"2017-03-27",3.6,"EBD 3/29/17. Medium clear amber pour with a beautiful garnet cast. Normal head volume, lacing and retention.

Outstanding rich malty nose with light fruit esters. The malt is caramel, as expected from the color, mostly but underneath is a nice toasty biscuit. The fruit esters are a bit ethereal and add a nice airiness to the bouquet. Apple and pear are the predominate notes with a touch of something sweeter underneath.

Light medium body, almost medium, with a smooth texture that is slick. The carbonation / body balance is outstanding. The middle is just effervescent enough to open the flavors up. The finish is prickly and finely bubbled.

The flavor profile is very good and well represents the style. It begins with a slight hop note that is grassy then shits to herbal. Herbal will remain the dominate influence. The middle hints at sweetness just enough to allow apple and pear to emerge over a light herbal bitterness. Surprisingly, caramel is underplayed while the toasty biscuit aspects take center stage. This characteristic provides a nice nutty background that competes with herbal hops for preeminence from the middle on. The finish is a slow fade of this competition and actually offers the sweetest palate influence.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"
3714,"2017-03-25",3.1,"Bottle. Enjoy by 03/29/17. The appearance consists of a medium sized fizzy khaki head with a short retention, transparent amber orange body, lively, fast rising carbonation observed, and no lacing. The aroma has a hint of hops, hint of fruit, toffee, sweet, bready, caramel, and toasted malt. The flavor presents light bitterness, light fruit, some toffee, caramel, and toasted malt. The mouthfeel is light carbonation and this beer is light-medium bodied. Overall, this is an easy drinking beer and a beer that I might consider drinking again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"

What we have here is an amber ale in the Irish tradition, and it does a fine job of being true to style. Albeit a tad high ABV wise. Anyway, it has a copper body with a soft off-white head. A malty beer, where the cereal grains call to order a sweet doughy aroma and flavor. A hearty medium-bodied ale good for late winter/early spring swilling.","","balloonbuffoon"

APPEARANCE: dark orange amber, almost browning, body that cascades bubbles in a balanced and full manner; the head is off-white creamy and thick, holding at a full finger... the glass drain approaches lacing appearing almost as webbing... AROMA: surprisingly hoppy, with tangerine and mango wafting with flowery scents to evoke a pale without the resin... oven-raised dough and caramel make for a balanced suggestion--hearty yet accessible... PALATE: immediate presence at the throat, kicking open the door with its maltiness and leaving a thick, toasted residue in its wake... the hops soften at the teeth, with little suggestion or staying power there... medium-bodied, warming (at 6.5%, formidable) and worth mulling over after each sip... lively...TASTE: the toastiness is overt, with toffee and caramel demanding attention... the hops are light and afford some fruitiness--apple, tangerine... a slight basement dankness is winning, as it adds strength to each sip... some nuttiness and buttery hints jam as many different angles into the profile as it seems possible... OVERALL: Great Lakes continues to impress, this time with a style that comes across as a workingmans ale braced for the month of March... flavorful, refreshing, bolstering...definitely worth the six I picked up just for the holiday...","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"

3714,"2015-02-10",4.3,"12 oz bottle, poured into a nonic pint at approximately 40 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a quite clear brown-amber, just a shade or two lighter and redder than the bottle glass. A careful pour causes virtually no head, just a short-lived cap of slightly off white that leaves no trace behind. Bubbles stream continuously from the bottom of the glass.

Smell: Warm toast wafts out of the glass, bready and malty, with some vague hints of nuts and a faint shadow of something floral.

Taste: Toast and cracker spring to the fore of the flavor profile, and are met by just enough of a grassy, floral counterpart to balance from sweetness into a state best described as having swallowed the Little Book of Calm. Swimming through the mix is a faint tone of pecan, and theres also a soft, slight metallic tang to the beer, far off in the distance.

3714,"2014-08-28",3.9,"Transfer from BA review on 2-27-13-
 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  Pours a deep amber color with a one finger just slightly off white head. The head has a pretty good level of retention, slowly fading to leave spotty lacing on the sides of the glass.

 Smell- The aroma is heaviest of toasted malt and a sweet caramel aroma. Mixed with these are a light toasted bread and fruit aroma of apple and some spice.

 Taste  The taste begins with a bready and toasted malt flavor with a lightly caramel sweetened flavor as well. As the flavor advances more the caramel fades more toward the middle with a light fruit flavor taking its place. The roasted malt flavor dwindles as well as the flavor moves on with a more doughy like flavor replacing it. In the end some light spice flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg as well as a light earthy hop come to the tongue. In the end a quite pleasant light roasted malt cider and spice flavor is left on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is a bit on the thicker and chewier side with a carbonation level that is on the more average to just above average side. The slightly higher carbonation is nice for keeping the drinkability, but not too high to take away from the aspects the thicker body accentuates- the roasted and spiced flavors of the brew.

 Overall  As should be of no surprise this is another good brew by Great Lakes. It has a nice blend of roasted and sweet flavors while still maintaining great drinkability but still remaining quite proficient in flavor.","","Darkmagus82"

3714,"2014-04-17",3.5,"Best by 3/21/14. Poured 2/16/14.

Appearance: Poured aggressively, but no head really to speak of. Perfectly clear copper color. No lacing to be seen. Looks decent. (3.5/5)

Smell: One of those brews I dont have a chance of accurately describing. It just smells like beer. No specific fruit, no significant, out-of-place hoppiness, not a massively overpowering malt aroma... just smells like a balanced mix of hops, barley, yeast. All I can really add is that it offers a ""red"" aroma. The smell indicates that the flavor will be more maltier than hoppier. (3.5/5)

Taste/feel: Strange. I swear, Im tasting a combination of vegetables. Potato skin, celery seed, tomato juice... the beer description mentions Conway as a ""meat and potatoes"" kind of guy, and this beer does truthfully have a cabbage soup sort of flavor (I can assure you this is not from the glass, by the way.) Entirely unexpected, considering the aroma gives no suggestions of that. Malt, a barrage of vegetative flavors, and then the aftertaste is a super subtle roasted ""red"" flavor. Thin initial mouthfeel that gets a bit thicker in the mouth (thats what she said). Medium carbonation at best. A truthfully strange beer in that it has some, again, very unexpected flavors. (3.5/5, 3.5/5)

Far from GLBCs best. Its an alright beer, but likely not one Id pick up again. I dont hate it though, not at all. Id definitely enjoy this with nothing else available.

3714,"2014-03-20",3.2,"12 oz bottle poured into a pilsner & english pub glass. Aromas of caramel and dough emanate first, but then fade. A sugary, cola note pokes through next with a slight hint of a spice (clove?). A clear, crisp toasted bread aroma follows this, and finally, it settles on a grape-y, peach-y juice-like aroma. It should be noted that all these aromas are light, and, with the exception of the spice note I couldnt quite pin, were fairly clear to an amateur such as myself (I justified an extra point beyond just average for that). The head is a notable, fluffy and soft, beaten egg-white texture (although light tan in color). The bubbles are a consistent micro-bubble that sits atop a clear, effervescent, honey-colored beer. There is a slight chill haze that, of course, fades as it warms. It leaves behind a moderate, micro-bubble lacing on the glass. The taste is a medium level of dry sweetness with a light bitter, and very very light sour note (lemon sour). This beer definitely has a dry quality to it thats pretty evident in the initial palate-feel. Its medium bodied, oily-light textured, with a soft, but zippy (soda-like) carbonation (in moderate amounts). The flavor is mostly a roasted nut, caramel, and grape candy character. It finishes with a blackened toast flavor which lingers, but its a mellow lingering.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Its the balance the retains a pretty good rating-- you can tell this beer was made with some love and skill when flavors dont work for you, but something still makes it work.

Here, its the strange lack of carmel or roasty / toasty maltyness.  Its there in balance, but there are no major flavor notes in these areas.  Its all much lighter and brighter than that-- very mellow, but not rich.

Aroma: The nose is sweet and malty, some caramel, toffee, bread, and a little bit of fruit

Appearance: It pours a clear reddish color with a small off-white head that leaves some light lace

Flavor: The taste, much like the nose, is rather sweet and malty, with minimal bitterness 

Palate: It has a light-medium body, some fizzy carbonation, and a bit of stickiness on the mouth

I thought this was a decent example of the style, but it so sweet and so fizzy that the drinkability takes a big hit.  There are some nice components here, but I could have used a bit more balance and a bit less carbonation.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Aroma certainly identifies itself as being brewed by Great Lakes, as that characteristic toasty, somewhat nutty smell is perceived right off the bat.  Other aromas of peanut butter sugar cookie and faint grapefruit hops.  Vigorous swirling really gets some fruit scents to emerge, but its difficult to place exactly what the scent is.  If I had to venture a guess, it would be an overripe plum.  Odd but also interesting.  Taste is strong of caramel, toasted malt, and really not much else.

Taste is suddy at first, moving to sweet cherries, moving to almost metallic, and finishing oatmeal grainy and crackery malt heavy. Really has an insane amount of malt husk and raw malt character that Great Lakes has in all of their beers. Just too suddy on the palate.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

3714,"2010-07-18",3.1,"UPDATED: MAR 26, 2017 Sixer from Liquor Barn (Jefferson Commons); drink-by date of 4/15/17. Aroma: Moderate caramel biscuit and toast in balance; nearly moderate apple-skin fruit. Appearance: Well carbonated, transparent copper with a foamy bone head that settles into a patchy ring. Flavor: Toast and caramel biscuits abounds; some light candied citrus notes with a good bit of apple skin (yeast?) becoming more apparent towards the finish, which is semi-dry and barely bitter. Palate: Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation, lingering finish. Overall: A bit of a head scratcher for me; good in some respects, especially the malt profile, but the hop/yeast combo comes off a little odd. Also, at 6.5%, this isnt ideal for a session, which seems out of character for this style, maybe 4.5-5% tops to be sessionable.

3714,"2010-04-27",3.1,"12oz bottle from a trade with phaleslu. Thanks Peter! Pours a crystal clear, copper-gold colored body with a finger-width, frothy, off-white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is at first a wet grain smell, almost like the smell of a mash. Upon second whiff, the sweeter caramels come out more with a bit of a toasted, nutty toffee. A faint apple-butter, herbal spice, and non-distinct hop. Flavor is much better. Sweet caramels and lightly toasted toffees greet the tongue before a wet grain, light grass, and some cherries come in. A few estery fruits thrown around as well as a touch of nutty spice. Finishes fairly crisp and dry with a very light bitterness and a medium length aftertaste. Light to medium body, very smooth, somewhat chewy at times, and a soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, not a bad Irish Ale. I think the wet grain works in the flavor much more so than the aroma.

Taste moves to a slight hoppiness that is still smothered by the caramel malt. Not very complex as any complexity that may have existed is humped into submission by the toasted caramel malts.

3714,"2008-03-03",3.4,"Pours a medium crimson-orange color with a fizzy, off-white head.  Spotty lacing slowly oozes back down into the body.  The aroma is comprised of toasted caramel malts, fresh bread, subtle dark fruits and mild floral hops.  The flavor is sweet, yet sufficiently toasty.  Caramel is met by toasted bread, sweet yeast, cream and floral notes.  The hop component is such that it takes a back seat to the light malts, adding just enough bitterness to counteract some of the sweetness.  Just shy of medium bodied, this one tends to get a bit sticky after a while.  Great Lakes tends to do these lighter styles very well, and this is no exception, though it is far from a special brew.

Aroma is that signature Great Lakes burnt malt character that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes distracting - here it fits in nice.  Some graininess and toastiness is also noted.  Reminds me a lot of the Eliot Ness.  Flavor is pretty rich, caramely.  Very smooth and easy to drink.  Medium bodied, low bitterness, with a grainy finish.

Crisp with an easy finish this has a real good medium bodied fullness to it. Flavor is more intense than the aroma, lots of sweet malts caramel and a touch of honey.

Not much aroma but what I do sense is sorta fruit hoppy and sweet.  The initial taste does reveal some hops but it is not overpowering like most IPAs. Much milder than an IPA but has the personality of an IPA without the offensive bitterness. Very nice creamy carbonation that is enjoyable but it does not attack your tongue.  The smooth bubbliness is sorta creamy champagne in nature.   Finish is quite hoppy but again it is not strong medicine bitterness like an IPA.  It is trying to build to that level but it ends up with a short medium bitter linger.

Medium-bodied, slightly thick and oily, and a substantive palate load, especially considering its parameters.

3714,"2004-03-29",3.5,"UPDATED: APR 15, 2011 Original Rating, March 29, 2004:  Pours a dark amber color with not much of a head.  Aroma is very much of grain.  The taste... holy malted barley Batman!  It kinda tasted like Grape Nuts.  A little wheat and some hops to slightly balance the flavor, but pure barley is the overwhelming contributor.  I liked it, but I can certainly understand why many wouldnt.

Re-rating, April 15, 2011: Copper color with a small head.  Aroma of caramel malts and a bowl of cereal, like Cheerios.  Light caramel flavor.  Smooth graininess.  Slightly buttery, but not in an infected way.  Same score.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
3714,"2004-03-28",3.4,"Dark amber color,small off white head that faded quickly leaving little behind.The aroma was malty sweet with a light honey like quality,some fruit and maybe some toffee hints.The flavor was malty and toffeeish with a decent amount of hops showing towards the end and a light fruit accent.The toffee has an almost burnt character to it towards the end.Not a bad brew at all but i guess i'd have to say i'm not to fond of the burnt like flavor,maybe i just needed more then one for a better review of this brew.Thanks to Jpdipso for sending this brew.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
3714,"2004-03-26",3.5,"Orange, amber. Thin offwhite head. Smells sweet and malty. Very nice flavor. Very light, a little dry, no real bitterness from the hops which surprises me. Nice and subtle.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","thehoff"
3714,"2004-03-21",2.4,"This bottled brew from Masterbruewer poured a very large sized head of foamy finely sized light brown colored long lasting bubbles.  The body was softly carbonated transparent and red brown colored.  The aroma was very mild and almost non-existent with only a slight red malt scent to it.  The mouth feel was mildly bitter with a medium malt hop bite.  The flavor was a somewhat weak red beer flavor with mild malt and hops.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
3714,"2004-03-19",3.3,"Pours a clear copper bronze with a puffy off-white head.  Aroma is mildy dry and caramely malty.  Body has a nice caramel sweetness and lightly toasted sugary malt flavor.  Finishes dry and grainy.  A nice Irish ale.  Thanks Drew!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3714,"2004-03-18",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2005 On tap, St. Patricks day: Cool red color. Malty nose.  Full bodied, with lots of sweet carmel and chocolate malt flavors.  Very nice toasted malt presence, too.  A little bit of hops appear at the finish, but this one was pretty much a ""malt forward"" beer.   I could drink this stuff all the time.","Reno, Nevada, USA","NVBeer232"
3714,"2004-03-05",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2004 Deep golden color (far from the ""ruby red"" the bottle claims), beautiful creamy, dense, lasting head which leaves impressive lace.  Fruity sweet aroma.  Sweet caramel and fruit-juicy flavors, quite malty and nicely balanced.  Medium body is perfect.  Very enjoyable.","DeForest, Wisconsin, USA","howie"

3714,"2004-02-19",3.7,"Nice bright amber color with a tall beige head. Rye bread (with fennels seeds) in the nose. Additional undertones of malt and peat. Small amount of lace. Very nutty and malty. Malt demands to be chewed in this one. A rather sharp bitting acidity late in the finish, while cleansing, a touch to distracting. I find the statement on the bottle rather amusing - ""In keeping with the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516, this beer is traditionally brewed..."". Now why would an Irish Ale need to brewed to the Reinheitsgebot?","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
3714,"2004-02-15",3.3,"(Tap at Hoggy's in Columbus)  Sweet malty aroma.  Dark copper color.  Thin white head, leaves light lacing.  Flavor is smooth- rich malt followed by a fruity hop bite.

3714,"2004-01-29",3.7,"Paid $7.99 for a 6-pack. First time I have actually seen it is today.

Beautiful appearance: clear, medium brown, with a gigantic, fluffy tan head. Carbonation bubbles rising throughout. Very nice. Head lasts as lasts.

Sweet caramel in the nose. Very pleasing.

Very nice coffee/caramel combination. It's rich, but not terribly thick. Nice, pleasant flavor!

I like this brew- don't love it. It REALLY is a good beer, and I'll have it from time to time (every winter).","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","hershiser2"
3714,"2004-01-17",3.5,"On tap at the Miami Inn.  Red-bodied topped with an initially fluffy, soon dissipating, light tan head.  Toasty aroma with caramel notes.  Flavor is classic Irish Ale: toasty with a Cheerios-like grain flavor, a touch of caramel, and finishing on a bitter note.  Sweeter than Goose Island Kilgubbin.  A nice treat.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
3714,"2004-01-07",3.1,"Nice amber beer, moderate white head, roasted malt and slight hop aroma, decent malt flavor with an above average bitter finish. some floral hints in the flavor. Good session beer.","Jeannette, Pennsylvania, USA","dolemike1"
3714,"2003-09-30",3.9,"This beer is a rich amber highlighted red ale that pours with a half-inch off white head. The head slowly fades to a thin film indicative of a malty beer. A very nice lace pattern is left on the glass. The aroma is very malty, with a touch of hops. The combination of the sweetness and the hops almost has a cinnamon charcter to it. Very intruiging. The flavor shows some nice hop bitterness up front, with a very solid malt background. Hints of peat smokiness show through in the mid, with a decent bitterness on the finish. A nice balamce of malt and hops make this very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is a bit sharp, but yet refreshing.","McMurray, Pennsylvania, USA","aaronh"
3714,"2003-08-17",3.8,"Malty beers have slowly moving bubbles, that's my observation. In this case the beer was only marginally cold, so that wan't it. They're downright lazy in their swirling. Mmmm, what a nearly Viennese malt presence here, so sweet and caramelly and roasty (in that order of dominance), yet surprisingly crisp in the finish. Higly recommended for Vienna fans, malt lovers, and aficianados of well-crafted beer.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
3714,"2003-06-12",3.6,"Reddish tint, small head, no lacing, tint to medium-bodied. Light and tart fruity aroma. Butterscotch, apple, hint of wood on the palate. As it warmed up, a malty sweetness became present. Very good balance. Slighty fizzy mouthfeel. Lingering bitter hops. Recommended but more like an English pale or a Belgium Abbey Single than a Irish Ale.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

3714,"2003-04-10",3.6,"Red tint to a golden colour. Head initially came from the bottle, but as I noticed this, I poured very slowly so no extraneous head could arise. Instead of a good amount of head, absolutely none came. Sour, sweet fruity aroma! A great mix of malt and hops to make a good Irish ale. Just like fellow jah_noth from Rochester as well....I typically don't like Irish Ale's much, but this one is quite an exception. I (jah as well probably) noticed a decent selection of this brewer's beers at our local shop, so I picked up every style they made, and I'm quite impressed with every single beer i've had of Great Lakes'! Too bad I can't find the IPA anywhere around!!!","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

3714,"2003-01-24",3.0,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2003 Typical auburn color, nose is very boring and tells little of the flavor.  Palate feels a little nice at the beginning. After a few drinks, it is seemingly all carbonation and not from the hops.   The falvor passes right away after a drinks, which might be what you want, but thats not for me.  The malts do little for the beer and nor do the hops. The beer is drinkable (as is water) but not really enjoyable.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"

3714,"2002-05-21",2.9,"I want to rave about this beer, I really do.  I love the brewery and I love my heritage and Im sick of cloying cheap red Irish ale knockoffs.

3714,"2002-03-30",3.8,"This brew pours a medium clear reddish amber.  The mostly diminishing off-white head starts out full and creamy, and has good lacing.  The complex malty nose is bold and spicy with a caramel toastiness balanced by resinous herbs and soapy dough.  The bittersweet flavor is balanced yet moderate with an acidic toasty quality.  The body is outstanding, and if I would have been blindfolded, I would have had no idea of the brews color.  This brew tastes ALOT darker than it looks.  The body is medium to full with lively carbonation a creamy texture that finishes very dry.  Great Lakes brewing continues to impress me.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"
