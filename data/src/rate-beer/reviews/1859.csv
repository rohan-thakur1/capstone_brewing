1859,"2014-05-17",3.5,"Poured into a tall lager class at brewpub. White foamy head that laced nicely. Clear amber red color. Toasty and well balanced with a great finish. Clean flavors all around without a harsh booziness found in some maibocks.","","redbeard3"

1859,"2014-04-29",3.7,"Tap at the brewpub. Hazy copper pour with a monster frothy cream colored head. Sweet malty nose. Taste is dark fruits and a caramel sweetness. One of the better Maibocks Ive had for sure.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"

1859,"2011-05-29",3.5,"Growler pour thanks to portableparty.  Clear dark amber pour, good carbonation and a sweet malty aroma. Flavor is caramelly malt, sweet brown sugar and slightly dry on the aftertaste.  A very good maibock, but not Barley Johns best offering.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
1859,"2011-05-29",3.7,"Growler pour. Pour is clear copper with a sticky off white head that showed some lacing. Aroma is sweet spiced malt and faint bitterness. Taste is sweet and malty with a nice fruit and spice taste going on. Palate is medium and sticky and finishes dry. Solid, I like!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"

Sweet malty flavor with some fruit and some toasty and bready notes. Medium body with moderate carbonation.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","maniac"
1859,"2007-05-02",3.4,"Pale orange color, slightly hazy.  Very sweet aromas, mostly citrus and toffee.  Some smoky wood notes.  A bit of a resinous hop undercurrent supports an extra sugary maple wood taste.  Bright shades of orange.  Clean and rich palate.  Slightly too sweet for my taste but very drinkable.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

1859,"2005-06-14",3.3,"Tap @ brewpub.  A tannish brown color with an off-white head.  A big hint of mint in the flavor.  Good malty texture and well balanced.  Slightly dry.  Quite nice and unexpected.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"
1859,"2005-04-09",3.4,"Gitchee Gumee Brewfest 2005. Weak wafts of rich berry. Flavors are dominated by sugary wheat and some blackberry. This is a Maibock! I love that crisp, clean sweet sugary smack and finish. Nice brew!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1859,"2004-08-24",3.3,"Nice amber body, creamy off-white head that lasts. Sweet strawbeery and corn aroma. Hopped and overly sweet strawberries/raspberries. Fairly thick mouthfeel. Not bad.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
1859,"2004-08-23",3.3,"Darkish amber body, wispy white head.  Smells like malty sweetcorn (but starchy and overripe).  Similar notes in the flavor except theres more bitter hops - watermelon rind and grass stem.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
1859,"2004-07-20",3.6,"Orange Coloring. Frothy Head.  Orange Soda Flavor...Hops...Very Smooth.  Not too Bad, but not my Favorite.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
1859,"2004-07-20",3.8,"Amber color with a little head.  Very malt aroma with a boat load of fuit.  I found this quite odd, but then the taste cleared that up.  More malt but the odd flavor seemed to be lemon and/or orange.  Never had a bock like this before, but it was quite tasty.  Sweet, but tasty.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
1859,"2004-07-14",3.8,"Sample at the brewpub.  Deep molasses-apple nose, beautiful dark cherry color, huge sweet brown sugar in the initial flavor, sweet herbs...quite thick, with some vanilla and anise towards the end.  Too sweet for many Id expect, but I loved it.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1859,"2004-06-03",3.4,"Deep amber color with creamy head; slow moving bubbles in the body.  Mild, grassy aroma, somewhat caramelly in a English sort of way.  Notable sweet edge when drank side-by-side with their Barley Bitter.  Smooth and relatively clean; I like the sweet edge.  Didnt taste like 7% abv, no way.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
1859,"2003-08-14",4.0,"Color is a solid haze of dark caramel copper with a very thin white head that fades to a thin ring and retains lots of stringy lace. One mighty fine looking Maibock! Smell is subdued dark fruits of raisin, fig, plum, and a slight sense of toffee. Taste is more of the same but much more improved upon fron the smell as it has a large variety of dark fruits, pale plum and raisin, with a mellow smooth toffeeness rendering it with a candied caramel, slightly sweet and finishes with a slight zip of tangyness. Feel is super silky smooth, light to medium body and goes down very easy, so much so its drinkablitiy is fantastic. Very good stuff. Although I think the ABV might be kinda high cuz this stuff went right to my head.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
