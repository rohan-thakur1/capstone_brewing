1741,"2016-11-04",3.4,"Draught. Ligjt gold color. Strong flavo of malt, hops are stronger than most of the style. Good flavor. Colpr is a little light. Good malt flavor.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1741,"2016-09-30",3.5,"On tap at the source with blonderedhead. 16 oz pour. Really attractive white lacing on a predominantly golden colored lager. Lighter citrus hop aroma with a hint of bready cereal. Taste is brighter and more hop centric than I expected from the Vienna lager style. Really nice malty, Euro feel to this one. Its probably one of the best of the style Ive tried. Hard to even classify it as a Vienna lager.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"
1741,"2015-12-13",3.5,"Good. I love the Vienna style. For me the key is noble hops or the best domestic alternative. The hop bitterness is a little forward for a Vienna and flavor a little earthy/piney. Maltiness is just about right. Head retention is good. It's relative though...this is one of the better domestic Vienna lagers available...most aren't even close. I'll definitely be drinking more of this.

1741,"2015-11-18",3.8,"Can. Pours a relatively deep amber thick and bubbly white head. Nose is wonderful - ovenfresh bread, hop spice, light orangpeel. Taste is crisp but still has a degree of malt richness, mild caramel with a citrus hop edge that lingers in a palate cleansing finish. Really good vienna - a bit hoppy but still very much to style with European hop flavors.","San Francisco, California, USA","asedzie"
1741,"2015-11-17",3.6,"Can. Wow, this style isnt impossible to pull off! Just need to have capable hands, which this brewer continues to prove they have. Clear golden pour. Rocky clingy white head. Nice citrusy fruit notes over a nice smooth malt base. Not sticky sweet, not dusty and earthy gross like so many in the style, just a well executed drinkable everyday beer.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
1741,"2015-11-11",3.4,"Can the poured a yellow with fluffy white head. Typical lager aroma light mild biscuit malt and light on the hop. The flavor mirrored the aroma light and easy drinking mild to medium body light hop mild bitterness.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","tmongoose"
1741,"2015-10-17",3.8,"12oz can pours a pale Amber with a large khaki head. Caramel malt aroma, light fruity hop and some earthy lager yeast. Taste of caramel malt which is quickly met by earthy lager yeast balanced nicely with bitter palate drying hops. Maybe the best Vienna Lager Ive ever had. Tasty and very drinkable!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
1741,"2015-10-07",3.5,"12 oz. can. Pours golden amber with a good frothy white head that hangs around for a bit and slowly leaves a thick film around the edges. Aroma has sweet earthy roasted malt subtle honey and citrus peel pretty clean. Taste is more sweet roasted malt subtle bitterness with fruit zest light white grape and a tinge of iron. Palate is clean thin pretty thirst quinching. Nice.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
1741,"2015-09-28",3.8,"Lighter orange appearance, markedly pale stylistically. Tangerine aroma surrounded in refreshing floral and herbal fragrance; lovely overall, and drastically hop forward, as only the softest toasted malt and baked biscuit can be perceived. Its obvious this is a well-hopped, fine-tuned lager, and given this, that the muting of the Vienna malt is unfortunate; rather, an earthy graininess suggestive of wet bark, or mulch, spreads out over time. Still, the flavor has shades of toffee, pear, and apple, highlighting the ample malt tissue of the beer and showcasing its seasonal effectiveness. Floral flavors remain abundant; the warm glow of tangerine-tinted hops like the sinking late September sun. Clean palate, soft carbonation; a brief, lacquering sweetness mid palate is whisked away in a woodsy, softly bitter finish. Fun seasonal concept, unique and well done.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
1741,"2015-09-28",3.8,"Much lighter and more golden colored than most standard Vienna lagers. Taste is pretty solid. Easy drinking, get some caramel, light hops. There are better Viennas out there but worth picking up a single can.","Minneapolis, ","Obfuscate"
1741,"2015-09-28",3.7,"Can. Amber color with a medium head. Light toasty caramel aroma, hints of woodsy hops. Strong toasted grain flavor. Bready. Hops turn more herbal. Leans bitter. Medium-full body. Moderately dry finish.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
