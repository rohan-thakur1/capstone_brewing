2919,"2016-04-05",4.3,"I was really happy with this. Beautiful blend of sweet and tart, nice darker color. Nice fine carbonation. Will seek this out always. I think aside from Ice Cider, the best cider Ive yet encountered.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"
2919,"2016-03-22",2.9,"$12 at Birra Pub. This is nice and dry for a straight Apple beer. It was definitely higher in ABV.

2919,"2015-10-01",5.0,"Amazing! Semi-sweet, soft tannins, full, juicy body, dry finish. Aroma is of standing in the middle of an orchard and taking a deep breath. A perfect cider.","","Craftbrewhaha"
2919,"2015-08-28",3.7,"Bottle - Sweet green apple.  Pale gold.  Little funk, semi sweet Apple.  Nice effervescent and nice finish.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2919,"2015-06-30",4.3,"Really nice cider pouring a nice crisp gold - The flavor is very similar to some of the English ciders but not nearly as dry. What was enjoyable was the authentic apple flavor that wasnt overpowered by sweetness like many on the market or the overuse of dryness. Its a very sincere to the point organic cider and well worth the trip to Seattle to bring back to California :)","California, USA","Cidertron"
2919,"2015-06-26",3.6,"Bottle at PIB 2015, pours a clear feint blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out red apple skins and a touch of champagne funk. Flavour of light-to-medium sweetness, with red apple skins, a touch of funk, and some light citrus. Really well-designed and balanced. Very good stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2919,"2014-11-03",4.0,"750 ml bottle from the Beer Authority.

Light golden pour, amply carbonated. Inviting nose: rich apple with white wine elements. (Ive really got to get better at cider descriptions!) The flavor is semi-sweet, exactly as advertised, with this lovely apple ""bite"", apple skins through the middle, and none of the off-flavored alcohols that one finds in the mass-produced ciders. The touch of sugar well into the close is a surprise and delight. Plenty going on in this flavor. 

This is a really delightful cider on the sweetish side. At 9% it is super stealth and could be very dangerous.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2919,"2014-10-30",3.9,"Bottle. Light amber pour, clear, aroma of apples with nice earthy notes. Flavor is balanced, apples, light citrus, subtle complexities that add to the overall success of this. Light and refreshing but still substantial and interesting. Really nice cider. Pricy but a good one for special occassions.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"
2919,"2014-07-21",3.6,"Golden in color clear with a thin head. Super Apple flavor and great finish this was by far the best I have for Apple Ciders.","Olympia, Washington, USA","BrewDad"
2919,"2014-07-12",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2014 gorgeous clear gold cider, though with the bottle conditioning eventually my glass was significantly muddied by yeast. Next time I might pour in one motion amongst a few friends but then again, why would I want to share? 
somewhat complex aroma, leathery and cellar-like dusty aromas, without seeming oxidized. suggests tart citrus, but with significant tropical fruit behind. very faint sort of barnyardy ""wild"" notes; very light MLF I wonder? does nothing but add complexity.
slightly sweeter than I prefer, a little more raw apple, but even that is nicely done. very floral apple, like a nice crunchy Ambrosia mixed with a good quality wildflower honey. little bit like some little wizened old wrinkly earthy apples sitting in a cellar. Complexity is short of the very best examples, but only just. Tannins are mostly astringent and everpresent but never get in the way of another sip. low bitterness in background.
alcohol is a little rampant, but at least it reminds me to drink it slower. Not quite obtrusive, but definite warming on the palate and throat. softly carbonated; spritzy like some French ciders would be weird with this lower sugar content; this works just fine.","Kansas, USA","udubdawg"
2919,"2013-11-19",3.5,"Dark golden pour which is initially fizzy with a robust head, then dissolves quickly to a still light amber. Aroma carries strong notes of spice, pastry dough, butter, and apples.. Pie! Sweeter than the usual semi sweet with a lingering weak caramel note. Carbonation is present but sparse. Drinkability is rather high for something so sweet and high ABV. Finish is a bit leafy with an underlying mousey hint, but this is overall an enjoyable cider.","Portland, Oregon, USA","goodbyeohio"
2919,"2013-10-15",3.7,"750mL split with GT2. Clear, flatter gold pour. Nothing special. Aroma is similar to dry French cider, use of French yeast perhaps, some yellow fruit. Taste is definitely on the sweet side and the alcohol is too high for French cider. Comes across as clean, rich, and juicy with great apple medley. Just a tad sweet for me.","Oceanside, California, USA","biggirlpanties"
2919,"2013-10-15",3.8,"750mL from Bottleworks in Seattle, WA. Clear, light straw pour with minimal fizzing out foam. Rich, juicy nose with dusty starfruit and pineapple phenol type notes characteristic of good Norman ciders. Taste is denser sugar, thicker sweet pineapple, mild alcohol bite, slightest sweet white dessert wine density. Sweet for a ""demi-sec"". Would definitely be a ""doux"" in French cidre terms. Still, yummy albeit too high alcohol to really use as a refreshment. Slightest tannic bitterness allows the palate to stay juicy, but the sugar and alcohol tend to be dominant after a glass. Not very utilitarian unless you are sharing this at a tasting.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
2919,"2013-06-22",3.9,"From bottle at 2013 Cider Summit PDX. Cloudy, deep yellow color. Aroma of fresh sweet apples. Flavor is sweet apple cider, caramel, and slight tartness. Finishes with the aftertaste of eating a fresh apple.","Oregon, USA","pdx77"
2919,"2013-02-21",4.3,"A well made and easy drinking cider, maybe my favorite from Alpenfire. Full of fruit ester and drinks playfully.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Lazerlobe"
2919,"2012-12-21",4.2,"Nose is apple skin, orchard and stems if not a little tannin. 
Appearance is a light golden similar to lemon juice but quite effervescent. 
Taste is more apple skin and nice drying apple flavor. sweetness is subtle and fades fast. really long finish that develops in complexity.
Palate is refreshing due to the tight carbonation and not sticky like lots of cheap ciders. 
Overall this was a great cider to have off draft. I wish more balanced ciders were available as opposed to all the apple juice tasting cheap stuff.","Seattle, Washington, USA","mages64"
2919,"2012-08-16",3.4,"Draught at Naked City, SeattleHazy pale blond color. Mild aroma of apples. Quite good apple flavor, the mouthfeel is not too weak, with respectable acidity, and soft sweetness.Pleasant.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
2919,"2012-05-08",2.9,"A very pale yellowwith a hint of haze. fresh chalky apples on the nose with more than a hint of wine yeast. in the mouth it is almost too sweet but very crisp. The sugar only gets a littlem sticky further down your glass. this one hides its strength crazily well and has the lightest hint of pear.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Alphadelic"
2919,"2011-04-27",3.6,"Hazy golden color/ no head. Fresh tart apple aroma with an earthy dryness. Very easy drinking, lightly sweet red apple flavor to start, turns to a lightly dry, crisp bitterness to finish--very tasty--","Same Trailer, Different Park, Louisiana, USA","AmEricanbrew"
2919,"2010-09-12",3.6,"Thanks after4ever! sure its made from a blend of bittersweet apples but it smells like red delicious and honeycrisp. bright gold, small white ring head. juicy and sweet up front, dries out a touch, remains sessionable throughout.","Bothell, Washington, USA","scrizzz"
2919,"2010-09-12",3.8,"750. Capped. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold. Mildly fizzy rim. Big tart red apple and cranberry nose. Almost a bit vinous. Crisp sparkling body. Medium density. Red apples, cranberries, and a bright chardonnay acidity to it. Refreshing, complex, and drinkable.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
