436,"2012-12-13",3.1,"GABF, 2012. Surprisingly sweet with palate for a cream ale.  Some light honey. It is only a cream ale so there is only so much you can do with it, but it is at the top of its style, one that seldom leads to interesting beers.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
436,"2012-08-04",3.4,"Had on draft at some bar I cant remember the name of. Very creamy and easy to drink. Slight honey flavors but nothing too crazy. Works well with the FL heat.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
436,"2012-07-29",3.3,"Tallahassee, Fl - Momos Pizza - on tap. Medium gold, sparkling pour, snow white head, nice thick lacing. Aroma has a hint of spice, otherwise pretty neutral. Flavor has some pear-like fruitiness, some buttery notes, a bit of honey sweetness and a peppery finish. Thick enough mouthfeel. Nice way to finish a slice of pizza with.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
436,"2012-07-20",3.9,"Xeno Honey Cream Ale is the embodiment of all the wonderful characteristics of a great summer time beer.  The color reminds me of the sun on a glorious summer day. The beer pairs well with summertime food, burgers, hot dogs and even Vietemesse tacos.  I highly recommend that you give a try.","","OrlandoMick"
436,"2012-06-20",3.5,"Draft at Fermentation Lounge. Pour is pale straw with a small white head. Nose is grainy malts, honey, and a good amount of spicy hops.

436,"2012-06-20",2.8,"Aroma is like citrus, light. Moderate frothy head. Clear golden in color. Very wheaty in taste. Palate is an abrupt finish.

436,"2012-06-14",3.3,"Draft at World of Beer in Land O Lakes.  Pours a crystal clear, pale yellow-gold color.  Foamy white head at first, but it quickly fades to a thin outer ring around the surface of the beer.  Some lacing near the top of the glass.  Slightly sweet aroma of honey and pale malt.  Flavor is light and refreshing.  Would be good on a hot Summer day around the pool.","Land O Lakes, Florida, USA","jjuf1853"
436,"2012-06-07",3.1,"Draft at Churchkey for the Bluejacket/Funky Buddha/Cigar City event during SAVOR week.  Poured a light yellow color, almost clear but theres a bit of haze in there. Aroma is dry honey, with notes of citrus. Flavor was honey, sweet notes. Interesting.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"

436,"2011-11-02",3.7,"On tap at WOB.  Light golden pour with a big white head.  Light and easy sippin with Pilsner qualities and some spice notes..","Florida, USA","50belair"
436,"2011-10-28",3.4,"Appearance: hazy straws  chill haze? White head is bready and smooth with a full collar and ambitious lace. Steady stream of bubbles keeps the head puffy and fluffy.

Nose: gentle sweetness. Angel food cake, white cake. Bread crusts to temper the sweetness without overwhelming. Gentle lemon esters. Dew-dropped cut green grass in the back.

Palate: creamy mouthfeel. Lemon zest and green grass lingers in the back from first quaff to last for some refreshing thirst-enticement. Dryness of bread crusts underneath with sweetness of angel food cake and white cake in the middle. Driest along the edges and tippy-top of my tongue. Honey.

Final Thoughts: yum! Not corny or grainy or adjunct at all but a true honey cream ale. The style itself may not be for everybody, but this particular offering from Cigar City was inspirational.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"
436,"2011-10-28",3.4,"Cream ale with a little of the body of a bigger beer. Honey is on the back end of the flavor and in the finish.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
436,"2011-09-15",3.0,"he aroma has yeast and malt with low hops. The appearance is very light with a creamy head. The taste is like the aroma with honey and a touch of citrus. Not all that special but tastes pretty good.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
436,"2011-08-15",3.2,"Tap at Kickbacks in Jax, FL. Pours a unclear, glowing SRM3 white with a fizzy white head. Not a lot of retention. Nose is sweet grain and lemon moving to fresh citrus as it warms. Taste is heavy dough with apparent graininess. Soapy and powdery mouthfeel with small macro feeling ""sting."" Something like grains of paradise and orange peel in the flavor produce and witbier character that is overpowering. Very difficult to see past the witbier aspect...perhaps a style change for this one.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
436,"2011-07-29",3.3,"Draft at Engine 15. Yellow with a thin white head tha tleaves laces. Scent is light grass and sweet malt.. Taste is lemony and grassy.","Idaho, USA","beernovice39"

436,"2011-07-15",3.6,"Growler from the brewery. Light gold pour with a thick white head. Honey aroma with a nice grassy hop balance. Light crisp malt taste with a grassy hop bitterness. Easily quaffable and slightly one dimensional, but a nice hot weather beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"

436,"2011-07-06",3.1,"CC mini growler thanks to David. Pours a clear golden/orange color with a medium white head. The aroma is sweet oranges and apple. The flavor is much like a fruity bitter; sweet citrus and light bitterness, earthy, smooth. Nice. Lots to like here despite being very light.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
436,"2011-07-05",3.3,"Pours pale golden color with a small white head that leaves some lacing. Aromas of honey, grass, grain and fruit. Flavors of honey, bread, grass, grains and tropical fruit. Mouthfeel was blah, which is to be expected for this style. As far as Cream Ales go this is one of the better ones Ive had.","West Virginia, USA","WVHouseofBeer"
436,"2011-07-03",3.2,"Light honey and sweet malts are the main points of notice in the aroma. This one goes down super smooth, with lots of honey and some ever so slight hops and some caramel malt. Natural honey flavor is probably the best quality of this beer. Too many beers boasting honey in the name come off tasting too refined and almost unnatural in flavor. This one is nice. Easy to drink. Good stuff.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
436,"2011-07-02",3.4,"The pour was a light yellow, and had a nice bubbly head. Smelled mellow of honey, hops and light citrus. The flavor was light, consisting of honey, hops and having a bitter/spicy finish. This cream ale was light, and had a pleasant fruity background, but was TOO light for a cream ale if you ask me. Ask me.","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
436,"2011-06-30",3.5,"Sample at the tap room. This beer is a clear golden color with a thin white head that recedes to an outer ring. Spotty lacing. Aroma of sweet honey and hops.

Taste was very crisp and clean, citrus, grass, slight bitter on the back. Decent beer would be great poolside on a super hot Tampa day.","Pickerington, Ohio, USA","BeerVirgin72"
436,"2011-06-05",4.1,"Poured up on tap at Cigar City Brewing Tap room with deep gold body and white head. The aroma is sugary sweet malts, fresh grainy malts and sharper lemon like citrus notes. The taste is a mix of honey sweetness, grainy fresh malts and then those notes are cut by firm spicy and floral hops. It ends dry with the help of increasingly bitter hops into the finish. Damn fine crisp fresh summer brew.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

436,"2011-05-31",3.3,"Growler Farewell to ibrew2or3 Clear golden beer with a small, quickly dissipating, white head. The aroma features pale grains, spicy Euro-hops and a hint of corn. Medium-bodied with dancing carbonation. The flavor is grainy, but balanced with a rumor of butterscotch. Finishes crisp and mildly bitter. Very clean for the style. Growler courtesy of askofficerfriendly!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
436,"2011-05-29",3.2,"Boring but silly drinkable cream ale.  Slightly sweet corn, slightly grassy hops, at least its not a booze bomb like the Batch 69.  Would be an excellent candidate for canning, should CCB go that route.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
