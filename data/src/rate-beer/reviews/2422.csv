2422,"2016-12-24",4.0,"375ml bottle @ Craig Bay. 2012 Vintage Pours a nice clear dark golden colour. Nose is apples towards a sour citrus variety. Flavour is tons of apple and their skins, some honey aspects but definitely baked/cooked apples with an every so slight tartness from the skins. Continued sampling presents a slight spiced finish as well.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiery_1"
2422,"2016-12-24",4.8,"375ml bottle. Pours a deep gold, with good legs. The aroma offers fresh cut apple, honey and floral notes. Fresh apple crispness up front gives way to sweetness in the mid-palate, with honey and baked apple notes. The sweetness persists into the finish, but is kept in check by apple crispness. This is a sweet dessert cider, but never cloying, and is delightfully aromatic and flavoursome. Delicious.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

2422,"2016-07-13",4.5,"Un liquide entre le doré et lambré, il est translucide et soyeux. Ça sent la pomme dans tout ses états. Jeune, fraîche, florale, cuite, épicée dans une finale de douces vapeurs dalcool. Cest un crescendo de saveurs. De lacidité au sucré, en passant par le poivré, dans une texture douce pour la langue et pour finir, une pomme dans un enrobage de caramel nous laisse la touche sucrée. Quel plaisir gustatif.

2422,"2015-10-07",4.3,"pours clear bright gold, orange tint, with some very nice legs sticking. sweet and spicy apples, caramelized apples, cotton candy and toffee apples, woody buttery barrels - never overwhelming vanilla and coconut; bourbon, cloying stevia-like sweetness, maple syrup as well, some tartness - ginger and citrus, clean. flat carbonation, full body - ultra syrupy; almost cloying, lightly tart and woody-spicy finish. very very good stuff - enjoyed it as much as regular ""réserve"" and unoaked declensions.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
2422,"2015-10-06",4.3,"2 oz sample. Very bright, crystal clear gold pour with pinkish hue. Aroma is quite winey, caramelized apples, touch of oak, floral notes, vanilla, quite perfumy. Taste is rich and mellow, very sweet, liquory, so rich and sweet, pineapple, candied apple, jujubes. Palate is probably the strong point of this one, intense sticky palate, drinks almost like jelly, the mouthfeel is so rich, covers your entire palate and delicately warms. Very good stuff.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2422,"2015-09-25",4.0,"2011 vintage Pours a clear golden with fine but sticky legs. Nose is of pommeau, apple skin and tart apples. Taste is moderately sweetness with a sharp tartness that prevents it from ever being cloying. Light brown sugar but mostly just some rich apple juice with a moderately high acidity level. Body is medium-full and mouthfeel lightly sticky and not as liquorous as some of the other ice ciders. Overall a fine way to end a meal, not especially different from the other very good ice ciders, no distinctive qualities.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
2422,"2015-09-20",4.2,"How: 2 oz from bottle at home. 2011 vintage.

>>> Total package ice cider. While there is not a highly distinctive quality (like the smokey character of du Minot Récolte dHiver 2010), its way above average in every aspects from sweetess to acidity, oak features and depth.

-  Deep bright golden leaving some nice sticky legs on the glass. 
-  Well balanced aroma consisting in caramelized apples, oak / wood spiciness, mild alcohol. 
-  Taste is even more interesting with a slightly above average sweetness for the style combined to a slightly above average acidity and superbly integrated oak features resulting in a clearly above average taste. 
-  Theres a mild tropical fruits presence in the background that gives a nice refreshing touch, which isnt very common in cryoextracted ice ciders but reminds me of the ""regular"" ice ciders from Coteau Rougemont. 
-  Medium to full body, leaning more toward ""full"". Lingering mouth coating sweetness that is slowly erased by the acidity. Not much warmth in the finish, except a wood spiciness touch. 

Flavors:  Caramelized apples, baked apples, moderate spiciness, oak, mild alcohol, mild tropical fruits.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

2422,"2015-02-21",4.0,"2015-02-14. Crisp dark amber body. The aroma is subtle but nuanced, sweet and acidic, apples with whispers of apple skins and something I cant place. 7+ Flavour is quite sweet but quickly turns acidic. Very lightly tannic notes. Syrupy medium to full bodied palate, no carbonation. My notes dont really do it justice but I quite liked it. Bottle at Mondial des Cidres, Montreal.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
