104,"2016-08-12",4.2,"Bottle bought @ Systembolaget. Pours clear deep golden / pale amber leaving some clearly seen legs on the glass with a swirl. Smell is heavy fruity with concentrated winter apple must, caramel, vanilla fudge, white raisins, honey, sherry, wood and hints of citrus peal. Taste is sweet, slightly sour and fruity. Mouthfeel is tiny viscous, oily, slightly tart, slightly sticky, tiny astringent, slightly boozy and medium bodied. Finish is sweet and slightly sour with sweet full flavoured apples, caramel, vanilla, white raisins, sherry, minerals and hints of orange peal and alcohol. Tiny bit hot perhaps but overall a beautiful ice cider with lovely white raisin oxidation and vanilla fudge barrel presence. Integrated and oily. Slight pity that most of the tropical fruit character from the base is gone but the raisin and winter apple replacement is lovely. Will be exciting to see how it develops.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"
