Arômes de pain frais, blé, pâtisserie, léger miel, avec dabondants effluves fruités (banane, agrumes, fruits tropicaux, poire). Outre lagrume, le houblon apporte quelques notes florales au nez, et une certaine odeur typique de la levure à weizen est également perceptible. Le nez est intéressant, complexe et intense. En bouche, la bière est pétillante et bien mousseuse, mais elle est également très mince au palais. Au goût, on retrouve un peu de pain frais en entrée de bouche, mais autrement, le houblon domine totalement. Contrairement à ce que le nez laissait présager, le houblon est plutôt résineux, avec quelques notes dagrumes et dananas. Lamertume est moyennement élevée. Cette bière, définitivement une hopweizen et non pas une weizen bock, nest pas du tout sucré en bouche, et presque pas fruité par rapport à son nez. Selon moi, ça en fait un breuvage aux saveurs déséquilibrées, manquant définitivement de richesse et de complexité en bouche. Il faut dire que les hopweizens, ce nest pas mon fort.

Nice hop presence although thats a background character, complimenting the malt body and fresh citrus esters. Flavour is also quite nice, spritzy upfront with some citrus acidity, followed by moderate pale malts and a somewhat dry finish. Not a lot of wheat malt character, I think thats why I like it. The yeast is also quite tame, as well as the carbonation, which I really appreciate. A nice tribute to Chretien.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

Crushed wheat, a floral bouquet, ginger-like spiciness and coniferous hop greenness coalesce in this HopfenWeisse, as a moderate Weizen yeast personality (some bananas and some cloves) rides a subtle sweetness. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam covers the cloudy blond. 
-The flavor profile are sharper when you leave out the yeast pour. Its as flavorful, but a bit muddled with the full yeast pour.
-This is a lot of fun to drink; the intensity level is not too high yet it is far from boring.
-Drinkability is very high due to the dryness and prickly carbonation.
