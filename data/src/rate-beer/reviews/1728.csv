1728,"2010-08-14",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 5, 2011 On draft at CBC. Came in with no head at all. This one is more of a cloudy yellow than orange like most hefes. Aroma is neutral. Flavor is OK, but the oddest thing about this hefe is its fizzy mouthfeel. A strange brew. RE-RATE: Sept. 2011. Nice fresh pour ont on the patio. Much better than the one I had last year. Good head and carbonation. Good aroma and flavors.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","MaBeer1972"

1728,"2010-07-18",3.6,"Draught at the brewpub. Very spicy, though natural, with a nice citric edge, though from esters, not American hops. Rich banana, great balance. Some hops in there as well. Big spice. Great stuff with excellent balance. Tingly, slightly bitter, peppery finish.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
1728,"2010-06-19",3.4,"On tap at CBC.  A pretty legitimate offering for the style.  Pours cloudy golden-yellow in color, as it should, with a one-finger white head.  Aroma is your typical banana, wheat, and clove.  Not too much banana like some can have.  Flavor is light and not too sweet with restrained banana, wheat, clove, spice, and bubblegum.  Crisp, medium-light, and refreshing on the palate.  Not a bad summer beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
1728,"2009-09-30",3.3,"In short: A standard crisp Hefeweizen that sticks to the basics of the style.  Well brewed but very standard.
How: Tap at brewpub 
The look: Cloudy blonde body topped by an off-white ring of foam
In long: Nose shows stripped-down basic hefe beer elements with wheat and some banana esters.  Taste is a hefe without bells and whistles.  Almost no spiciness, orange peels or any other occasional hefe flavour elements.  Nice body with a lot of wheat with a moderate banana flavour.  Pleasantly not sweet.  Very clean and crisp and refreshing.  Really basic except for a more-than-average floral hopping.  Semi-dry finish.  This is a well done clean refreshing beer but it also exactly like too many others.  This brewery makes some world class beer but this one wont win any medals.  Or maybe it will.  But not in the 100 meter dash.  Im sure of that.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1728,"2009-08-22",3.8,"Tap at CBC.  Hazy golden, small white head.   Familiar Hefe nose, not over the top like too many American interpretations.  Very nice, clean, refreshing flavor that balances the hops malt and wheat very well.  Usually not a big fan of the style, but this is very well made.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

1728,"2009-07-28",3.1,"A hazy blonde weizen with a thin white head. Light pleasant banana esters in aroma, cloves, pungeant and interesting.

1728,"2009-07-15",3.6,"Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub.  Tons of lace that follows a yellow body with noticeable white head.  Creamy mouthfeel, clean and refreshing taste.  Good example of the style. Fresh aroma.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
1728,"2009-03-12",3.1,"The pour reveals a hazy yellow color with a thin white head. Pleasant aroma of bubble-gum and cloves.

1728,"2008-09-23",3.4,"Draft at the brewpub.  Pours a very hazy, glowing, tangerine-amber color.  A frothy, snow white head is large at first but fleeting, leaving soapy clumps to slowly lumber their way back to the surface.  Aromatics include bubblegum, fresh wheat, candied orange peels, freshly grated clove and cinnamon.  Flavors take more of a turn for the sweet, with notes of candied sugar accompanying the fresh wheat grains, vibrant citrus rinds, and earthy, fall spices.  A surprising yet welcomed addition of floral hop bitterness shows on the finish, adding balance.  The body is medium to light, with a lively carbonation.  Overall, this is a crisp, clean above average Hefe with a bright citrus profile and a lightly spicy, hoppy finish.  I enjoyed it.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

1728,"2008-06-18",3.8,"On draft at brewpub. Pours a very cloudy, almost opaque, gold with a white head. The aroma is strong of wheat malt and weizen character (banana, soft fruit, cloves, pepper). The flavor follows the nose - a nice dose of fruit and crisp wheat. The finish is crisp, malty with wheat, and somewhat dry. The mouthfeel is strongly carbonated, crisp, and medium in body. Overall, a great, delectable hefeweizen that was deliciously appropriate - both to style and to season.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Very inviting. Delicous, just like it smells. Could of used more wheat flavor. A little light for me, as far as the wheat flavor is concerned. Yup, its banana and some light citrus notes. A little thin for the appearance. I expected a thicker beer. Especially since it was an opaque yellow color. Could of used a little more body. Wouldve rated it higher if it had a better mouthfeel. Very good going down. Nice cool summer night. I had 3 with dinner, 1 after. I thought about getting a growler today. I wouldve last night but we were there past thier serving time.

1728,"2007-01-19",3.5,"Draft at Redbones. Opaque lemonade pour with a well retained white head, neither fizzy nor creamy. Decent nose of banana pudding, clove, yeast and flowery perfumes. Flavor is very nice, with added notes of lemon zest, citric spices and tart lemon-lime icing. Palate is very light and refreshing, though at times does get a little stuck in the recesses of my mouth. Finishes crisp. Refreshing quencher, best part about it was the total absence of a grainy texture I get tired of too fast with Hefes.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
1728,"2006-09-14",2.9,"Deeply hazy banana-colored body with a clean, velvety white head. Aroma of clove, light rubber, flowers, and bubble gum.  Flavor has prominent clove and bandaid qualities, plus aspects of wheat and very light toast. Long phenolic-bitter finish; strikes me as too bitter.  Chewy texture for a hefeweizen made this less than refreshing. I didnt particularly care for this, but then again wheat beer fatigue has long since kicked in for the summer.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"

1728,"2004-09-20",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2006 2004 draught @ the brewery.  Brilliant, deep, orange-gold, very bright and only moderately hazy.  Small white head.  Aroma of mild wheat, light banana and a hint of orange peel.  Flavor proves to be wonderfully full of bubble gum esters, light tangerine notes, clove and banana on the finish.  Hint of hops and a wonderfully balanced malt really make this one incredibly drinkable.  I really like the dry bubble gum and banana esters matched with a sweet malt and spicy hops and clove.  It works well, and proves to be very authentic.  Awesome stuff.  A little less wheat flavor than I would like, but the yeast influences almost make up for that in my mind.  Pleasant carbonation, medium body with a bit of wateriness on the end.2005 draught  Hasnt changed that much, though a bit less full malty than remembered and slightly more watery.  Still a great flavorul and well-done, but I could stand a bit grainier malt, and more grit to it, with a touch more lively carbonation to style.  Seems to sweet, candyish and creamy-smooth.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
