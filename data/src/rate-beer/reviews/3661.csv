3661,"2017-01-28",4.5,"A The Bruery magas alkoholtartalmú, nagy kaliberű főzetei már ránézésre is súlyosak, lerí róluk, hogy valami különleges dolog lapul a díszes palackban. A Poterie alap-verzióját korábban már alkalmam volt megcsodálni, elképzeléseim tehát csakis a legvadabbak voltak az ital whisky-hordóban történő érlelést követő testet öltését illetően. A minőségi old ale-ek illata önmagában is pazar, a scotch vaníliás, likőrben ázott fahordós, karamellás, enyhén füstös jegyei azonban koronaékszerként hatnak az aszalt gyümölcsös, mazsolás, fügés, datolyás, kissé csípős, pikánsan alkoholos aromaszerkezeten. Szerkezete fenséges lakhelyéül szolgál a mannaszerű ízeknek, a quadrupelhez hasonlatos, aszalt szilvás, diós, cseresznyés, vaníliás, desszertboros csemegék egyvelegét alkotó kompozíció szivárványos jegyeinek. Minden egyes kortya merő izgalom, teljesség, intenzitás; mesterien megmunkált tartalom. Elegáns, exkluzív főzet, melynek a legapróbb cseppje is kimagasló értéket képvisel.","HUNGARY","adster"

3661,"2016-09-18",4.1,"Very dark brown pour, not quite black with a decent head for the high ABV. Aroma hits hard with a lot of barrel character and dark dried fruit. Taste starts with sweet malts but gets quickly replaced by a quite intense astringent tartness. It finishes with dried dark fruit notes like figs, prunes and dates. Body doesnt feel very heavy but the alcohol is quite present and makes it a bit hard to drink. Overall its a very complex and interesting beer but the weird tartness in the middle taste and the intense alcohol heat keeps it away from being really great.","Timisoara, ROMANIA","ciocanelu"

Dark brown with a medium sized tan head. Aroma is boozy and malty with caramel, dark sugars, prunes, vanilla, light roastiness and hints of smoke. Taste is very sweet, malty and boozy.

Molasses, roasty grains, sweet smoke, and dark chocolate on the nose. Creamy heavy thick body with sluggish carb. Chocolate, roast, molasses, and smoke on the mid palate. Long sweet finish.
