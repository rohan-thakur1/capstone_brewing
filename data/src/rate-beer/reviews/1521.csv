1521,"2015-05-30",4.0,"750mL bottle drunk 5/20/15Another great appearance from Jester king; huge, fluffy white head is very well-retained atop a ripe peach-colored body with high clarity, leaving sediment in the bottom.Pure, wonderfully done amarillo in the nose. Heavily floral with just a touch of sweet tangerine and light lime. They are quite uninterrupted by the malts, which, on account of the very low acidity, need very little sweetness to balance. House yeast adds a touch of minerality that is very enjoyable, almost like warm well water. Soft orange blossom-like aromatics continue as it warms while just a touch of light caramel emerges from the cara malt.Very similar flavor profile, hop-forward but with a complete lack of acidity. Very impressive. Wheat gives a softness to the body, though there is a bit of hardness from the carared (wish theyd left that out, but then, I pretty much never like cara malts in light to mid strength beers). Other than that, its just a flowery, soft, incredibly drinkable beer with much more flavor than youd ever expect for its size. No alcohol or flaws. Everything Ive had from these guys that hasnt been oxidized to all hell has been outstanding.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1521,"2011-09-25",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2011 750ml Bottle: Cloudy, with an almost golden-yellow/lightly orange color, yet clearly cloudy with a bubbly white head.  Looks thin.  It has an intense aroma of hops, with a very defined, fresh, floral, spicy, fruity, tropical hop nose thats clean and simple. Flavor is very smooth (thanks, wheat), with an interesting finish thats of really, really intense, fresh hops.  The intensity of the hops, coupled with the thinness of the beer really allows you to experience every aspect of the hop varieties.  Light, tasty and really hoppy, this unusual beer is very impressive.

Cask Conditioned with Amarillo at the brewery: This cask-conditioned version of the Jester King/Mikkeller collaboration, Drinkin the Sunbelt, is dry hopped with (more) Amarillo in the cask.  Making a good cask-conditioned beer that entertains the palate enough without the assistance of carbonation requires a well-crafted beer.  This does not disappoint.  Its smooth, easy, and delicious, with the Amarillo picking up the work in delivering a blast of floral, almost cirtusy hops.  Perfect for summer drinking (hey, Im at the brewery right now, drinkin Drinkin the Sunbelt in the middle of the worst drought in recorded Texas history (at least since the 20s) and its doing a great job of keeping me well-hydrated.

1521,"2011-09-17",3.7,"750ml bottle from Mora2000, thanks Bill! Pours a cloudy gold-orange colored body with a big, two finger-width, dense and foamy, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing throughout. Aroma is sweeter lemon and orange citrus florals with a light grass and a light wheat malt. Flavor is similar. Crisp citrus up front with florals and a light grass. Light wheat malts come in to balance with a touch of spice. Yeast comes in at the end as this finishes dry, clean, crisp, and light-moderately bitter with lots of citrus, some grass, and a nice wheat twang. Lengthy aftertaste following a light body and moderately lively carbonation. Overall, a very easy drinking and flavorful beer for being only 4.2% ABV. Lots of clean citruses, a light wheat malt, and some yeast make this dry and refreshing. They nailed this session beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

S: Starts off with a fairly strong floral hop aroma.  There is a lot of orange rind and mild citrus sweetness.  Also a mild malty sweetness.  The hops are somewhat perfumey with just a little bit of grass.  A healthy dose of pale, cracker malts and wheat as well.

T: The flavor has a significantly more pronounced citrus character.  Lots of orange peel and fresh, juicy tangerine flavors.  Some floral hops and grass, too.  Plenty of pale malts with a cracker note.  Nice and dry with a soft bitterness, which is good for a beer like this.

That said, this lacks the yeast strains that I know find not so amusing and replaced it with one that has a much drier and more ""refined"" finish. I want to get another bottle or a few RIGHT NOW.

The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is a great mix of wheat with some grassy and citrus hop notes. You can really get the Amarillo hops in the aroma. 

The flavor is also very hoppy. There are a lot of citrus and grass notes mixed in with the nice wheat backbone. Light to medium bitterness and very easy to drink. For such a low alcohol beer, it is packed full of flavor.

The aroma is very hoppy, but in the harsher sense. Small lemon citrus notes with a fat punch of almost catty hops. Some sweet fruit prevails. 

Watery mouthfeel with honestly a weak flavor. Very bitter hops on the flavor with maybe some sweet fruit? Whatever redeeming qualities it may have is demolished by the SUPER bitter hop flavor.

Very heavily cloudy (to the point where the sun refuses to pass through-almost) faded cut wheat straw color (ask this old farmboy), creamy 3mm head formed and laced picture perfectly upon the vessel.  Aroma of oranges, piney hops, yeast, and smiles from that one blonde haired, blue eyed girl that always winks at you.  Hits the mouth with an even medium body, malt is light to the tongue but still powerful enough to be enjoyable, some pepper and coriander (with a very light note of parsley) in the middle, finish lingers and makes your heart sing.  One year ago MIkkeller himself posted in the Austin forum here on RateBeer that you should keep an eye on these guys.  I had my doubts.
