2438,"2014-04-15",4.4,"Bottle @ Three Counties Cider Shop, Ledbury. A startlingly bright and colourful blend and my first sip of ice cider. Ripe, mushy apple flesh give way to thick, deeply fruity complexities before a smooth honey warmth settles things down. Very interesting, each sip opening up new colours to the palette with a real sharp clarity. Exceptional.","Shrewsbury, Shropshire, ENGLAND","minutemat"

2438,"2012-08-21",4.0,"Bottle at Chrisos Pre-GBBF Shindig 2012. A clear golden amber colour with no head once poured. Sweet apples, a delicate tang, spice, vanilla & honey. Really sweet but maintains its structure. Doesnt linger overly so on the palate. Quite crisp & fresh despite the intensity of the sweetness. Drinkable, really almost too much so. Medium body, soft mouthfeel with a modest lingering finish. Fantastic with good complexity.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","sm89walt"
