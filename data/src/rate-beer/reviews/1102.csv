1102,"2012-11-11",3.0,"From bag in a box at The Henglers Circus. Pours cloudy yellow with a small white head. Aroma is sweet and crisp pears. Smooth fruity, light on the sweet side. Mild citric note just lurking through. Lingering pears fruity into a mellow and light sweet finish.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
1102,"2012-10-30",3.2,"Bag in a box at County Hotel Spoons Ashford. Well it isnt awful. Lets start from there and work backwards. I asked for a half and got a pint. Its a cloudy dirty gold colour no head. Aroma of mashed apples and pears. Its actually quite drinkable. Enough sourness to keep me interested enough sugar to rot the enamel on my teeth. Its ok. May not drink again unless forced but enough fleshy fruit to carry it.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

1102,"2012-10-24",3.6,"Cask at the Hamilton Hall, JDW, London. Pours cloudy yellow with basically no head. Sweet, lightly tangy aroma with some sweat notes. Big sweet flavor with light tartness, pear candies, sugar, mellow sweat. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Faintly warming to finish with a bit of good, sour tang, some salt, big ripe and sugary pear. Nice stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
1102,"2011-10-11",3.6,"Polypin, chilled @ The Powder Monkey, Exmouth, Devon.Hazy, cloudy straw yellow and still. Robust candied pear nose, sweet, clean and straightforward. Quite sweet, luscious ripe fruit on the palate. Medium bodied with a little peppery residual carbonation showing upfront, smooth as it heads south. Very tangy pear notes, some peach and honeydew comes through, the swallow being a little vinous, fruity and not unlike a sweet Chenin blanc. Very long, the tangy fruit dominates the palate in a good way, it avoids becoming cloying and actually draws on the saliva and tickles the tastebuds. The pint quickly disappeared, at which point I thought it might be dangerous to order another. A decent, if somewhat simple Perry that does what it does well. Nice!","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

1102,"2011-08-25",3.0,"Cask @ Sir Walter Scott, JDW. Hazy yellow colour, no head. Nose is pear juice, bit of leather. Flavour is sweet pear upfront, followed by some fairly sharp sourness. Dry finish. Pretty decent for a perry.","Burgos, SPAIN","Bullit"
1102,"2011-08-14",3.0,"Bag in box (Whetherspoons (JDW), Cambridge)
Hazy yellow. Massive sharp aroma, a touch vinegary. Super bite. Finish has banana skin. A bit too sharp, without the fruity body to back it up. Still pretty OK though.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
1102,"2011-08-08",3.3,"From the box at Knights Templar. Cloudy pale yellow, close to pastel. Huge pear aroma, bosc or Bartlett-like. Some spice too. Sweet and tangy flavor with mushy ripe pears, some blue cheese, canned pears. Very interesting, nicely tangy, smooth and full. But a bit like a tangy fruit candy, it got irritating after a while.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
1102,"2011-07-28",3.4,"Polypin at the Wetherspoons Summer Cider Fest 11. Straw with no head. A good mix of sharpness and fruitiness, full, grape like flavours with a citric background. Very pleasant.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"
1102,"2011-07-26",3.6,"From a polypin at Bankers Draft (JDW), Bedford, in Wetherspoons Summer Cider Festival 11. Pale gold, and a very tempting fruity aroma. Sweetness and sourness here, and its quite astringent. I relished every drop of this.","Bedford, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","hughie"
