1672,"2016-04-17",3.5,"May 9th, 2014 - Societes Pugilist dips me into the dark end of Societes menu, dark and brusk looking, even in its tiny undersized serving glass. The aroma has a lovely charred malt scent, though the olfactory is exhausted from the line of beers from all branches of the beer family tree. The flavor is easier to discern, cool, dry and oats, with lots and lots of oatmeal. Its more like a breakfast stout, in the most literal sense of the word, which means approachable, friendly and flavorful.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1672,"2015-11-29",3.7,"Pitch black and opaque without even the faintest trace of lighter color when held to a light source. Two finger foam head that quickly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Sporadic streaks of lacing left behind.

Robust roasted dark malt aroma countered by subtle earthy hops and silky sweeter dessert-like malt notes. Slightly smokey with gourmet espresso, ash, toast, oatmeal and bittersweet dark chocolate countered by tootsie roll, sweeter chocolate. Just a touch of piney, grassy hops in there for balance. Smells really nice. The roast is excellent but not overpowering wih a nutty presence that reminds me of gourmet Ethiopian coffee.

Medium body with a nice balance of bitter roasted dark malt, robust coffee bean and sweeter dessert-like dark malt flavors. Pretty dry and bitter up front with burnt toast, coffee grinds, oatmeal, smoke and bittersweet dark chocolate countered by piney hop and lighter malt sweetness. Hints of caramel, toffee, roasted nuts and flourless chocolate cake. Decently balanced but not as well as in the nose. A bit too bitter and heavy on the roast for my preference but still a solid beer.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

1672,"2015-06-12",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
A drop of milk in the coffee, a bit of fruit in the roast and an intelligent acidity to accompany the bitterness; a good Milk Stout from top to bottom.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the blackness.
-Drinkability is very high, as it seems to be in all of their products.
-Lactose comes off nicely to balance out the roastiness.
-The more I discover Société brews, the more I see links with Green Bench in St. Petersburg (FL). Everything they do is lean, super clean, delicate, poundable, balanced, etc.

1672,"2014-10-09",4.0,"Poured up on tap at the brewery where it exhibits a nice dark body that is mahogany in color and has dark amber edges and supporting a dark tan head that leaves behind some spotty lacing. The aroma offers up dark roasted malts and dark roasted coffee offset by sweeter notes of malts, a dash of molasses and a little bit of chocolate going on as well. The taste starts with a bit of sweetness and then getting quickly into dark roasted malts, spicy black licorice and a thin streak of burnt maltiness. To midway more chocolate notes seem to slide into a coffee like sensation and then ends with lingering tasty coffee. There is taste and body oplenty for this little 4.8% beer.
