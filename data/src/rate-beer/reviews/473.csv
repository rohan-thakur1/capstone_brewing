The creamy mouthfeel has a full body and hefty on the palate. Superb integration and probably takes the cake for my favorite Impy Stout. Just incredible! I don't know what Burial is doing, but they need to keep doing it! Best local brews by a country mile.

The most recent version is spot on though, allowing you to get an incredible array of flavor that I had loved in the earlier versions. The coffee is incredibly rich and flavorful but not so overpowering that it take away from other flavors here. The chocolate and rich molasses sugar qualities are so apparent! Great job!","Asheville, North Carolina, USA","AVLBeerMagnet"
