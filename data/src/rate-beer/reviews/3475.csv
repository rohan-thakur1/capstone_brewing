3475,"2015-04-19",5.0,"Bottle about 1 and a half years old from the November 2013. The smell is great, lots of bourbon, oak, coffee and chocolate. This beer is soo smooth, the texture is just perfect, full body, light carbonation, it just flows on your tongue. I love the original PÃ©chÃ© Mortel, but the bourbon barrel gives it an additional complexity which is, in my opinion, very beneficial. Bourbon and oak flavours blend gracefully with the coffee. Along with those dominating flavours, I taste some slight chocolate notes, toastiness, sweet but not as much as other big bba imperial stouts that IÂ’ve had. The finaly is light warming alcohol with a mild coffee bitterness, and again, not too swee. The finish is dryer than one might expect. This is one of, if not, my favourite beer from any Quebec brewery. This beer is not too big, but just perfectly balanced and smooth. It gets to me every time, love it!","Quebec, CANADA","jonabea"

3475,"2015-01-09",4.3,"341ml bottle with much thanks to mcberko. Labeled as 2013. Pours lovely opaque black with a short-lived tan head that dissipates to leave behind a ring of fine bubbles and some irregular lacing. Aroma is lovely -- milk chocolate and vanilla comes first, followed by a small dose of well-roasted coffee, and finishing with blackberries and dark fruit. Really impressive, balanced, inviting nose. Taste: Coffee is much more prominent in the mouth, but still wonderful balanced. Layers of chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, vanilla, and roast. There is sweetness, but instead of the syrupy heavy-handed sweetness IÂ’ve come to expect in barrel-aged stouts, the sweetness here is ... deeper, subtler, more nuanced, and balanced nice roast, bitter finish. The result is a taste that is rich, but comes across neither as overly sweet nor particularly bitter. So yeah, I basically just used a lot of words to reiterate ""balanced,"" which IÂ’d already said. Expert wordsmith I am. Finishes somewhat dry with warming alcohol in my belly (and on my tongue, now that I can step back and am not so enamored with the rest).

A - Pours pitch black with a small half finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to a thin film, leaving no lace at all on the glass. Rather dead if IÂ’m honest.


S - Smells of deeply roasted coffee, oak, vanilla, chocolate, caramel, dark roasted malt, warm bourbon booze. Still has quite a bit of coffee for its overall age, pretty impressive aroma.


T - Starts off with a mild coating sweetness - mainly the chocolate, vanilla and fresh toffee - quickly being joined by the warm bourbon, woody oak and plenty of dark roast. Finish is pretty dry thanks to all the roast and booze, lingering long after the finish.


M - Heavy body with moderate to low carbonation. This is definitely a big beer but the feel kind of got away from it. If it could be bumped up a bit this one would be money.


O - I had wanted to try this one for awhile and I am glad I finally got to try it. It still packs plenty of the base flavors and the bourbon is a complement rather than the star, as it always should be. I would love to have this again.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

In other words, a lovely aroma with lovely coffee. Very smooth bourbon character lending some warmth, backed with moderate oak & vanillin from the barrel. Bourbon is quite tame on the palate... Lots of oily coffee, a little ashy bitterness leading into a bigger, creamy sweetness. Roasted malts, chocolate, wood, & very timid booziness.

Thanks to MartinT for sharing this at a tasting at the Craft Beer Company in Clerkenwell. One of the clear stars of the night I knew it would be excellent because it is based on an already world class beer. There was no disappointment either. IÂ’m not sure of the availability of this one but if I ever have friends going to Montreal I am going to ask them to pick some up.

Aroma / Appearance - The oily black base has been enhanced by aging in bourbon barrels. The sticky tan head and legs are like sheets of dirty ice sliding down the sides of a car window. Chocolate, plums, coffee, and traces of vanilla balance out a rich bouquet. The booziness is evident yet does not come across as distracting at all.

Flavor / Palate - Silky smooth and smoky, the first sip reveals a creamy rich body. Chocolate, plums, anise, and coffee alternate for main focus in a deep and flavorful blend. The barrel aging is evident yet does not ruin a solid beer with overly vanilla or oaky notes. This feels less like a money grab and more like an attempt to play with the evolving trends of the brewing culture.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Served side by side with the standard PÃ©chÃ© Mortel.

The beer is dark brown with a small, beige head that leaves almost no lacing on the snifter. The dominant aromas are oak and bourbon, followed by a roasty, coffee presence. The flavor follows suit. The delectable coffee character I enjoy so much in the standard version is a bit overrun by the dominant bourbon barrel flavors. That said, this is still a very tasty beer. A nice, warming finish shows a bit of the alcohol. While this was most definitely a nice treat, I would have to give the nod to the plain olÂ’ PÃ©chÃ© Mortel.

3475,"2012-12-19",4.1,"Thanks goes to Mike for the brew. Apologies goes to those who may have wanted in - IÂ’m out of beers and IÂ’ve had a heroin itch to drink this sucker. Poured out a beer that was contained within the bottle that I opened. LOL - First line of BlackIPAÂ’s review = gold. Heavy coffee aroma, a not-quite-thick aroma of coffee nearing a filter smell or whatever - which is not saying anything bad. Saying something bad would be like this: this stank reminds me of my junk after I popped out of pink socking a tranny. Unfortunately that wasnÂ’t the case or didnÂ’t happen - take your pick... dark choco, thick dark lightly smoky salt on a very gentle soft long smelling around the rim... soothing vanilla, the colour purple, no smoke now, anaheim peppers.. that seems pretty odd but I canÂ’t quite shake that thought. As it warms the chocolate softens into a darker borderline milk version - no lactose thoughts.All of that needs to be mined out of the coffee/ choco shell. The taste is superb with a mild burn which bits and never lasts but the heaviness of the flavours do. Choco, licorice (itÂ’s there somewhere), a well blended mess of the choco, heavy non-sweet roast, coffee thing. Vanilla, I was going to say zero fruit but I may have forced myself to consider something orange. Sucking on my teeth is interesting and I cannot quite figure out the flavour aside from the bacteria poop from a day of ignoring brushing. This is not overly complex but itÂ’s 4 knuckles of a full fist of flavour. Ashy. I have killer breath now. HIghly enjoyable beer that could be a sipper or a full out get drunk on multiple beer chugfest. The subtle aromas are the clear winner of this beer. This is better than the regular version but IÂ’m not about to compare grades. I like it cuz itÂ’s not all about being bluntly barrel aged.

3475,"2012-08-14",3.7,"Poured from a 341 mL bottle into a snifter.

Nearly black in appearance, there is a vague cranberry tint that is more noticeable at the edges.  A small foamy tan cap rests on top off the beer until it slowly fades away.

The aroma has a big espresso nose with subdued bourbon notes.  There are some dark roasted malts and chewy fudge notes as well.

Each sip starts with fully roasted malt and some dark chocolate.  It is less creamy and sweet than the regular version.  The bourbon comes through along with a bit of oak and vanilla.  Toward the end, a hint of coffee turns into bitter coffee grounds, which I could really do without, but this finishes the sip.

The body is a little bit lighter than what I would ideally want from a 9.5% bourbon barrel stout.  There is a noticeable dry nature to this beer from the barrel, especially compared to the base beer.  The coffee imparts a somewhat acrid mouthfeel as well, and it is grainy throughout.

I would have expected barrel aging PÃ©chÃ© Mortel would have made a great beer even better, but it simply is not the case.  I would rather have the regular version, and it is conveniently much easier to come by as well.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3475,"2012-07-29",4.5,"I received a 2010 vintage 341ml bottle in a trade with a blogger in Quebec (thanks, Marc!). I poured it into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Black as night body with a brown, soapy head which is fairly quick to dissipate, but does leave a bit of lacing and never completely evaporates.

Smell: Black licorice and black coffee dominate the nose. Interesting synergy of sweetness and bitterness. A hint of bourbon sweetness and smoke as well.

Taste: A lot of craft beer enthusiasts hate the ""trend"" of bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts. But if the result is a beer that tastes this great I donÂ’t see a problem. I liked but didnÂ’t love the original Dieu Du Ciel Peche Mortel, but now itÂ’s at least a candidate for conversation for contention with Hall of Famers like Founders KBS and Firestone Walker Parabola. Massive coffee flavor and accompanying bitterness right from the start, plus an underlying taste of black licorice which imparts both a confectionary sweetness and a touch of astringency. Dark chocolate begins to emerge after a few sips and becomes so prominent that the beer would be better classified as a mocha stout than a coffee stout.

The bourbon character is noticeable, though. ThereÂ’s a subtle vanilla flavor that emerges on the second half along with a burst of straight up boozy heat and rubbing alcohol taste right as it finishes. You can call it distracting,  but IÂ’d consider it part of the character (itÂ’s easily tolerated). The aftertaste contains a faint coffee bitterness and a slightly sticky/cloying black licorice taste. But despite all that itÂ’s actually relatively clean considering whatÂ’s in the beer. A delicious and impressive palate all around - but IÂ’m not quite sure it was worth the equivalent of $33 I spent on it in an international trade.

Drinkability: Any barrel aged imperial stout is something to handle with care, and while Dieu Du Ciel Peche Mortel Bourbon Barrel Aged is far from the strongest beer IÂ’ve ever had at 9.5% ABV, itÂ’s still quite strong after two years in the bottle. ThereÂ’s definitely a noticeable alcohol presence in the palate and an accompanying warmth in the throat after each swig. The carbonation is low enough to make it go down smooth, but itÂ’s far from tepid, too. A fantastic beer  for a special occasion considering how rare and expensive it is.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
3475,"2012-07-27",3.8,"Thanks to Tommy for sending a bottle my way!  Pours out a fairly viscous, deep dark brown with decent tan foam.  Aroma on this beer is quite nice - tons of fresh bitter coffee, a touch of vanilla and bourbon, and some rich chocolate malt.  Flavor is not quite as nice as the aroma indicates - still lots of coffee, but itÂ’s a touch weaker and more bitter than in the regular peche.  The barrel characteristic is subtle, but noticible.  The flavor has all the right pieces, but for whatever reason doesnÂ’t come together as well as in my favorite BA coffee stouts (bourbon county, KBS).

The coffee notes are still certainly present, followed by bourbon notes, wood, and loads of alcohol. The aftertaste is dominating the barrels, with a noticeably burning alcohol sensation.

3475,"2012-03-28",4.0,"341ml bottle courtesy of Ian at the 2nd Ottawa gathering, got a nice sized sample and was very happy to be able to try this one (although surprised that DDC still uses the gold foil label to indicate their special releases). Anyways. Dark brown with a tan head. Mellow bourbon with the expected vanilla and mild oak, the coffee seems to be overwhelmed although it is present, also some baked bittersweet chocolate, burnt / caramelized brown sugar. Moderate body and carbonation, lacking the crazy mouthfeel I was hoping for but maybe that is just expectations setting me up for disappointment (not that its not good). Sweet and delicious without overwhelming, to be honest though not sure I like it as much as the regular peche which is quite odd because I was pretty sure I would like this one better.

T - The coffee isnÂ’t as pronounced here, instead, melding with the sweetness of burnt sugars and chocolate and light bourbon barrel notes. All very-well done and simply stunning.

3475,"2009-06-25",4.7,"In short: Our beloved roasted PÃ©chÃ© Mortel with a moderate barrel character adding some complexity
How: Tap at Brouhaha, Montreal
The look: Black body topped by a small long-lasting tan head
In long: WeÂ’ve all know the regular PÃ©chÃ© Mortel so IÂ’m just gonna describe how this one differs from the original.  A little less roasted, roasted coffee beans almost as present, the powdery cacao/chocolate of the regular are more regular black chocolate in the barrel age, some woody notes not present in the original, subtle vanilla touch added, is a little more round and a little less roasted, a little more boozy than the original.  Overall the differences between the regular PÃ©chÃ© Mortel and this Bourbon Barrel aged are not flagrant.  This is not like the Speedway Stout and the very different over-barrel-aged disappointing BA Speedway.  With the PÃ©chÃ© Mortel the barrel presence is moderate and the most of the original beer character remain in the Barrel Aged version.  The regular remains more drinkable because of its dryer, more roasted and less boozy character.  However what this Bourbon Barrel Age loses in drinkability it gains in complexity and this what makes it imho a slightly superior beer over the original.  The regular PÃ©chÃ© Mortel remains one of the favourite Imperial Stout, probably in my top-10.  But this Bourbon Barrel PÃ©chÃ© Mortel is now my #3 Imperial Stout behind the Expedition and the Darkness.  IÂ’ve had many glasses (too many) of this fantastic beer at Brouhaha anniversary party.   You may hear a story from that night of me dancing on a table on a Abba wearing only my socks and with my Tommy Hilfiger underwear on my head.  This story is false.

Flavor is wondrous: starts with heavy coffee, bitter chocolate, and immense amounts of cream. The bourbon comes in at the finish, with a fiery but smooth burn. Malt character is excellent; complex and rich. Palate is epic, creamy, thick, and full, and the alcohol is perfectly placed on the tongue. Vanilla and caramel mixes with the bourbon to create an entire second tier to the flavor that pairs extraordinarily well with the first tier of cream, coffee, and chocolate.

I literally got one of the last pints from the keg (Thanks Mark!), but the head was excellent regardless. Aroma is bursting with coffee and vanilla. Slight bourbon notes evident, but nearly slip under the radar. Imparts the perfect amount; not too strong or overly boozy, but certainly noticeable and welcome. Dark chocolate and cream sneak in as well to form an excellently rounded and multi-faceted malt character. Flavor is a blast off coffee, dark chocolate, and bitter roasted malt. Again, bourbon is noticeable in the finish and lingers making its present known ever so slightly. Boozyness makes itself slightly more up front than other Peches IÂ’ve had, though I donÂ’t think the ABV is any higher. Again, this facet is welcomed. Palate has a heavenly creamy texture that is extremely viscous, but surprisingly drinkable. I could have sessioned this if there was any more left, but alas...

Big sweet bourbony aroma, sweet vanilla, muted dark malt. 7++ Flavour is similarly quite bourbony, sweet dark malt. Vanilla bourbon character lingers long into the aftertaste. Bitterness grows and is a bit sharp in the finish by the end of the glass. I donÂ’t really get much coffee character out of it. Smooth full bodied palate. 4++ Pretty solid, bourbon character is just a bit too strong for me, but it maintains the richness of Peche. Blend this 3:1 with regular Peche or Deese Nocturne and I think it would be amazing.

2009-06-06. Black body with a huge creamy brown head. Massive coffee aroma, fresh coffee dominates over pretty much everything else but its nice somehow, even as a non-coffee drinker.

Not much, it might even be my imagination really. Coffee is rich but starts to be a bit much by the bottom of the glass. (8+) Smooth medium to full body is very smooth but feels less like it is on nitro than usual. (IÂ’m curious to know how it was being served.) (4+) Very good even for a non-coffee drinker like myself. I didnÂ’t really notice a lot of oak influence on it to be honest, but then I was kind of excited to try it, perhaps I finished it before it warmed up enough to truly reveal itself.

3475,"2009-06-06",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2017 My Bottom Line:
PÃ©chÃ© MortelÂ’s usual rich tiramisu coffee cake nose is now rendered more complex by well integrated droplets of silky vanilla and oaken alcohol for a masterful, if not serious, sipper of an Imperial Stout.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy veil of foam lingers atop the jet black.
-The body is sooo luxurious (yet not obese).
-The subtle fruitiness of the vanilla bourbon notes is cleverly blended into the base beer. The barrel aging job (and the subsequent blending) was expertly done.
-While I like to think that the regular PÃ©chÃ© Mortel is actually quite drinkable when on nitroed tap, I wouldnÂ’t be able to say the same for this one. This barrel-aged version is for meditative drinking only. And so, it might even bring spiritual ecstacy as well...ItÂ’s that good.

Robe noire opaque, lÃ©gÃ¨re mousse mocha, effervescence moyenne. TrÃ¨s harmonieuse et complexe, des notes de chocolat au lait sont accompagnÃ©es par le cafÃ© qui est moins insistant que dans la version originale. Le bourbon, la vanille et le chÃªne sont prÃ©sents, mais relativement discrets. Finale de cafÃ© et de vanille, plus douce que celle de la version originale. Vraiment excellent et Ã©quilibrÃ©.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MJGG"
3475,"2009-06-05",4.4,"Tap at Brouhaha 1st anniversary party.  Pours a nice creamy dark black with a thin lasting off beige head and great lace.  Aroma is a nutty creamy smooth big espresso- earth, leather, and light but balanced bourbon- good vanilla mixing with the chocolate and roasted coffee.  Smooth bourbon in the flavor- very subtle and acts to blend the beer together better- smooth yet intense coffee, vanilla, chocolate, toasty, nutty and some earth.  Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and it is quite easy to drink the whole glass too quickly.  Great stuff.  200liters made.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
