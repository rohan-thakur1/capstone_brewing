1891,"2016-03-02",3.8,"Tap. Solid amber color with a thick sticky off white head. Aroma is wet hay, and light sugar. Clean spicy bitterness that lingers in the finish layered over toffee cereal malt notes. A nice one to sip on in an enclosed patio with my dog at a local restaurant as 35 mph winds whip through town","Montana, USA","Kevin"
1891,"2014-08-19",3.3,"On tap at pub. Pours out a nice crisp amber topped with a small sand head. Nose is nut sweet malts and a hop kick. Taste is as the nose with a nice grapefruit hop on the end.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
1891,"2014-06-15",3.4,"Growler. Pours a near clear amber with a near white head that dissipates to the edges slowly. Aroma has a nice light pine note with a good amount of grain and a bit of sweet grains and caramel backing. Flavor has a similar light pine note with some sweet grains and caramel as well as a hint of earthiness.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1891,"2014-05-17",4.3,"On tap at The Range restaurant in Bernalillo, this beautifully balanced PA paired quite well with my chile rellenos. The beer is an American with a British accent: smooth, spicy, floral Kent Goldings hops, with a smooth, sweet caramel note coming from English Crystal Malt (Simpsons medium?). A pleasant sharp bitterness at the end. Overall, very nice!","Corrales, New Mexico, USA","maltman53"
1891,"2014-01-05",3.4,"On tap at the brewery. Comes a clear amber with a small tan head. Aroma of malt, grain, and fruit. Taste is malt, citrus, grain, and floral. Somewhat bitter finish. Nice.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
1891,"2013-07-18",3.5,"On draft at the brewpub in Albuquerque. Pours a clear dark amber with an off white head. Rich malty nose. Nutty flavor. Bitter finish.","Jackson Hole/McLean, Virginia, USA","Iphonephan"
1891,"2013-07-18",3.6,"At the brew pub on draft an amber color with a slight head no true aroma that I could detect strong hoppy flavor that does not stay long on the palate","mclean, Virginia, USA","Westchesterco"
1891,"2013-06-08",3.2,"Tap at La Cumbre. Dark amber, clear pour. Minimal foam. Webby lace. Muted nose. Taste is decently bitter, biscuit, dark bread, chocolate finish.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1891,"2013-01-03",3.7,"Tap @ La Cumbre. Pours a clear, dark amber appearance with a khaki head. Lightly fruity, a bit toasty malty, light caramel aroma. Chewy, rich caramel malty, somewhat earthy, floral flavor. Nice brew.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
1891,"2012-12-16",3.5,"10oz draft from La Cumbre; November 2012
The beer arrives from the tap with a bit more than a ¼-finger thick, pale, tan colored head that has a bit of staying power to it. The beer is a clear, rich red color that shows a bright amber hue in the light. There is lots of toasted pale malt character here as well as quite a bit of aromatic crystal malts. A light, herbal and citrus character adds some balance to the nose.

My first sip is herbal, bitter, with lots of balancing crystal malt, woody pine like flavors, some definite citrus, and a touch of dank herbal character in the finish. The beer is light and quaffable, but has enough malt heft to carry the hops. This beer is quite malt focused, at least compared to many a contemporary American Pale Ale, but really it is nicely balanced between the malt and hop character (which was likely the point). Quite nice and enjoyable in the end, and definitely a beer to have a couple of when you are in the mood for an American take on an English Pale Ale.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
1891,"2012-12-08",3.4,"Draft at the brewpub. Pours a semi-cloudy orange-amber with a small off-white head that laces the glass. Aroma of cereal, pale malts, faint earthy hops, toast, and sweat. Flavor of earthy hops, sweet and pale malts, and citrus late. Light-medium bodied, with medium carbonation and a malty mouthfeel and dry finish. Good EPA. Not my favorite style usually, though.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
1891,"2012-10-27",4.0,"9th August 2012GBBF. Very hazy amber beer, tiny pale tan head. Light dry palate. Lovely hops - a complex array of Nelson Sauvin like grapiness with red berry fruits and citrus. Very very drinkable and I can scarcely believe this EKG hopped!",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"
1891,"2012-09-09",3.4,"Half pint from the barrel at the Great British Beer Festival 2012.  Cloudy brown/red with little head.  Lovely aromatic grapefruit aroma.  Dry, bitter and well hopped.  A pleasant and smooth sipper.  Nice but a bit 2D","Berkshire, ENGLAND","prawlie"
1891,"2012-07-28",3.6,"Growler... Pours clear and deeply amber with a small, creamy, white head. Excellent retention. The nose presents lots of good buttery toffee alongside juicy, citrusy, peppery hops. Medium-bodied with a skim-milk mouthfeel and lively carbonation. The flavor leans bitter, but also offers lavish notes of caramel  and toffee. Crisp, snappy, lightly acrid finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1891,"2012-05-17",3.8,"on tap at the brewery.  Dark amber in color with a small frothy and creamy white head.  Somewhat cloudy.  Aroma is lightly malty with a stronger citrusy hop presence.  Medium bodied with creamy texture and soft carbonation.  Lightly sweet and somewhat more bitter.  A very nice pale ale.","Apopka, Florida, USA","smaynard6000"
1891,"2012-01-04",3.3,"Deep amber-red with white head.  Nice malt and hop balance in both aroma and taste.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dnstone"
1891,"2011-11-23",3.8,"Draft at GABF. Pours a nice looking copper with a fluffy head. The nose is fresh and clean. Grassy hops and hints of caramel come through. Nose has orange blossom as well. Dusty malts. On tasting, nice a full malt profile with a clean bitterness. Good ratio of bitterness and hop character with the malt. Really great EPA.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
1891,"2011-11-10",3.5,"Draft.  Looks great - fairly clear orangish-amber color with a one-finger white head.  The aroma is pretty nice, earthy, spicy, and floral hops with caramel behind it.  The flavor has a good balance of hops and malt.  Caramel and biscuit malt base with good earthy and spicy hops.  Medium-bodied with average carbonation.  Not as good as the other two La Cumbre beers I tried, but still very good.  These guys are legit.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
1891,"2011-10-18",3.5,"Amber with a slight haze.  Surprisingly little aroma.  Toasty, crackery malt with earthy hops.  Firm body - lots of minerals in this?  Anyway, decent stuff - American style with English ingredients.  I remember the first year of Smuttynose Big A IPA was like that - its an interesting concept.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1891,"2011-10-03",3.5,"On tap at GABF. Orange hued body with a small just barely off-white head. Aromas are bready with light caramel and toast. A bit of esters with some spicy, woodsy, green hop character. Flavors are bready, toasty, light caramel with some woodsy hop notes. Bitter balance (slight), medium carbonation. Good","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1891,"2011-07-05",3.5,"On tap at the brewpub.  Pours a clear brown with a thick white head.  Aroma of sweet fruits and bready malt.  Flavor of sweaty hops, caramel malt, bready malt, floral hops.  Decent drinking but the seasonal pale (Lazy River) is better.

1891,"2011-06-13",3.6,"tap at brewpub-fire it up!!!  copper hue with a soaphy eggshel head.  sweet malts and earthy hops on the nose-caramel, leafy (EKG hops?).  minty, piney earthy hop flavors with a good sweet malt base (toasted grains).  for some reason, this reminds me of Stone pale ale-alot of hops ,but not overly bitter and more of an english style than american.  however, it doesnt have the diacytl you would find in an English pale.  long dry earthy and leafy finish.  almost like an ESB.  cool brew!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
1891,"2011-04-28",3.6,"Copper orange pour with creamy off white head and lace. Sweet malt, bread caramel, and resiny hops. Sweet malt with a good resiny bitter. Medium bodied with good  carbonation. Nice beer","decatur, Tennessee, USA","decaturstevo"
