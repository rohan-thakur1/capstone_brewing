Poured into a nonic pint, this is a fairly clear beer, amber in color with a finger of soapy off-white head. A nice bread character to it. Earthy and slightly citrusy hops (orange peel, for the most part), and a subtle toasted character. A touch of pepper is there and maybe a hint of grass.

Light nose of biscuit and herbal hops.

Light medium body with a smooth texture that imparts moments of oiliness and creaminess. Perfect carbonation with a rich prickly effervescence from the middle on.

The world class flavor profile is intense, complex and balanced. It begins with a blend of herbal and citric hop flavor over biscuit. As hop flavor recedes in the middle, a mild noble hop bitterness takes the forefront over a balancing biscuit sweetness. The finish is a bit crisp, and a tad dry, with a lingering noble hop flavor over a subtle receding bitterness.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"
4269,"2015-05-09",3.7,"Tried this beer for the first time at Jacobs Field in Cleveland. It was a local Craft Beer, so I had to try it. 

For being a Lager, it sure had a lot of hops. Although other flavours tried to keep it in check, the hops were just too potent for my liking.

Quality brew no doubt, but probably wont try again.

4269,"2014-12-10",3.1,"12 oz bottle, poured into a shaker pint at approximately 45 degrees F.

A: Pours a crystal clear pale orange, leaning towards gold but definitely more on the orange side of that line, with a fair amount of bubbles visible. The head is fairly thing, and rather short-lived before dying to a ring of white and eventually, nothing at all.

S: Bread, is the main takeaway from the aroma. Whole grain bread, with extra whole grains and some cracked grains along for the ride. Theres some very faint toffee essence in there, and a little dry mustiness, like a long-sealed library being cracked open for the first time in decades.

T: The scent did not lie - whole grain bread flavor is present, and in spades. This has significant bread and grain malt character, for most of the tasting process. Theres a leathery soil note, however, that cuts through any possible sweetness, and is especially strong on the finish, leaving a bitter, clay-earth aftertaste. There are some other, very faint notes present, grassy and fruity, but the bitter soil conceals them enough that I am unable to pick them out.

M: Light and slick in the mouth, and rather sharply carbonated.

O: Not my favorite lager, to be honest, but this is also not my favorite lager style. The earthen noble hops are present enough to obscure some of the other flavors for me, and the malt tones are less biscuit, more bread and grain, to me. I usually avoid this one, and the occasional revisit reinforces to me why I do.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

4269,"2014-08-01",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 8-28-12 - 
 Served on tap in a 10 0z chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer is served as a golden colored beer with a two finger white head. The head fades in a few minutes to leave a nice level of lacing.

 Smell  The aromas are of a biscuit malt as well as a light caramel. With these aromas is also a very light citrus hop aroma.

 Taste  The flavor begins of a crisp buiscuit flavor. Soon however a light sweet honey flavor comes to the tongue. This honey flavor is rather short lived however and again is lost more toward the end as some light hoppy flavors of a citrus and floaral nature come to the tongue. These flavors bitter the beer slightly and give just a little bit of bite to the taste, leaving a rather crisp malt and lightly hopped taste on the tongue. 

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average to crisper side with a carbonation that is rather average as well. 

 Overall  Crisp, flavorful, and easy drinking. A nice lager to go to again and again.","","Darkmagus82"

Appearance: Appropriately enough, gold. I had virtually no head on my pour despite being aggressive with it, but theres a nice little white film that floats on top. Decent lacing.

Smell: I dont know... truthfully, nothing going on here. Its hard to say it smells good, and its hard to say it smells bad. It almost smells like nothing, for me. Really, *traces* of malts, but other than that, Id think Im smelling water. Im gonna have to bump up my taste/appearance/mouthfeel scores just to give a better impression of what I think of the beer overall. Damn lacking aroma!

Taste: Fantastic stuff, right here. This is the final year-round beer from Great Lakes that Ive had, and like their others, this is great. Theres virtually no bitterness to speak of with this beer on the front, and theres a very, VERY nice sweetness that lasts beginning to about the end. While theres that almost candy sweetness (probably from crystal malts) on the front, the finish mellows out a bit, and welcomes some pretty heavy biscuit flavors, with maybe a slight bit of hops. The slight hoppiness balances out the initial sweetness of the beer. I really enjoy it. Dortmunder Gold also has a solid body, but thats to be expected with the ABV %.

Ive yet to have a beer from Great Lakes that Ive been truly disappointed in. I wasnt overly impressed with Lake Erie Monster, but it still trumps a LOT of other beers that Ive had. This is just a great beer, and would be a good choice to get somebodys feet wet into the world of craft beer.

4269,"2013-07-25",4.0,"As I was reviewing this I thought about why its so hard to describe a classic german lager because of its simplicity. 

This was a terrific German style lager that is everything a beer ought to be. Simple yet makes a positive statement. Its classic, its crisp, clean, hearty and dry. You cannot properly describe it without being overly effusive. Brilliantly clear, superb head, perfect amber color. Light lager bubbles coming up to the top of the glass. Looks like yeast on top when the head falls. Soapy lace. Smells like bread. Smells like good bread. Herbal, husky and grainy. Faint citrus zest is more on the palate than on the nose. When you drink it you are sated, satisfied. Lightly sweet and earthy. Finishes grassy and with a slight hop bitter. It fills up your mouth and your belly. Citrus keeps the mouth watering while the earthiness lays in dry and palate cleansing. Mouthfeel is substantial but remains light overall and the carbonation adds to the refreshment. 

Terrific classic taste that does not wander all over the place , stepping outside the lines and blurring itself to a bunch of different styles. Its a lager that tastes like a lager. I love it.","New York, USA","pinkie"

4269,"2012-10-28",3.8,"Currently the #1 Dortmunder / Export Lager.

The beer is crystal clear and golden hued, with a thick, dense head. Superb head retention and ample lacing left behind. An outstanding appearance. 

The aroma identifies this brew as a lager, with a large grain and/or bready presence. Definitely smells akin to an authentic German lager. 

The flavor is malt forward, but certainly balanced. Slightly sweet, with some bittering hops in the back. Subtle notes of citrus, with a splash of lemon. 

The feel is creamy and smooth on the palate. Spot on carbonation. Lingering notes of hops and sourdough bread.

A solid beer. Certainly one of the better German style lagers brewed in the United States.

Aroma has lots of caramel and toffee along with that signature Great Lakes yeasty smell; it is not off-putting, however. The aroma is definitely malt-forward with lots of biscuit. Some herbal/lemony hop aroma is in the background and very faint.

Flavor continues with the malt with lots of biscuit, toast, and caramel. The same yeast that was present in the aroma is there in the taste as well. Some faint hay/spicy hops are present in the background. Bitterness is on the lighter side with a slightly sticky finish. Mouthfeel has decent substance.

4269,"2012-08-25",3.4,"16. oz poured into a pint glass at Logans Tavern in DC. From notes.

A: Pours a light copper color with very evident carbonation and good clarity. The head is a one finger offwhite color the solidly retains a thin layer, and provides sheets of lacing down the glass.

S: Toasted grains and hints of earthiness. Absolutely nothing wrong with the scent, its just rather subdued.

T: Has a generally toasty caramel malt flavor like I expected (if youve had Sam Adams Boston Lager before - and Im pretty sure you have if youre American - then youll know exactly what to expect here). What caught me off guard slightly was the hints of citrus on the finish. No mindblowing complexity here, but I dont expect that in a lager anyways. Good stuff.

M: Healthy carbonation with a light, crisp finish. Nothing fancy or special, just easy drinking.

Dortmunder Gold pours a translucent gold color with tints of copper and orange. A fair amount of small bubbles rise up from the bottom of the glass to refresh a foamy white head. Nice retention and a little bit of lace.

Bready pilsner malt, some noble hops, and a bit of citrus zest are first noticeable in the nose. A light alcohol aroma exists in the background as it warms. 

An initial sweetness comes with a biscuity malt flavor, which turns grassy for most of the sip. A light floral hoppiness comes in at the end. A lightly bitter finish.

The aroma started with a typical light lager scent, sweet grain, light biscuit, smooth malt, and a touch of yeast. The moderate hop in the flavor was earthy and lightly lingering, and paired well with the malt in good balance. Crisp, lightly dry on the finish, and pleasantly sessionable.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

Well balanced but leaned toward the sweet finish. No diacetyl. Medium body, medium carbonation. No alcohol warmth. Overall a well balanced beer that remained true to style.

4269,"2011-10-26",3.4,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a pilsner glass.Appearance: Darker than your average lager with an amber/orange color; crystal clear; massive carbonation visible. Forms a large, white, frothy head which retains and laces very well.Smell: Typical clean-style, Bavarian Purity Law-conforming lager. No adjuncts; slight grassy hops; hints of lemon peel. Taste: Beers like Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold are the most difficult beers to review. Its lager in its purest form - fairly mild palate with few distinct flavors and the one that are there are subtle. Few craft beer enthusiasts are lager enthusiasts and Im certainly not one of them. The beer is so named for all the awards it has garnered, yet nothing stands out to me about the palate here that is noteworthy. At the same time there is absolutely nothing that turns me off, either.The palate is difficult to describe. Fairly generic lager flavor throughout. The difference between this and one of the big boys is theres not obvious presence of adjuncts. I get a slight hop spice and minor cracker-like maltiness but its not a beer I would describe as being bitter or sweet. It finishes clean and is very refreshing. Does that make it a great beer? Not by my standards since I dont grade to style, but if you like it - more power to you.Mouthfeel: Fairly thin (although Ive had thinner); fizzy, wet, clean with no aftertaste.Drinkability: If theres one thing this beer has going for it, its the drinkability. The mild palate is thirst-quenching and the clean finish makes it a beer you dont have to think about. I certainly never wouldve guessed this is a pretty hefty 5.8% ABV from the palate and body since it seems so light on its toes. Sessionable to be sure, and an ideal beer with finger foods - but not the kind of thing Id seek out for the taste alone.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

4269,"2011-09-06",4.1,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Pilsner glass.

Appearance: Clear, burnt gold with bubbly stark white head and nice lacing rings.

Aroma: Very fruity (apple, pear, lemon, citrus), with hay, fresh cut grass and peppery hops.

Taste: Great balance of malt and hops. Lots of fruit, particularly apple and lemon, which are augmented by high levels of hay, straw, and grass (almost too much for my liking). A decent level of noble hops provide a spicy, peppery and bitter counterbalance, but are kept in check until the aftertaste.

Palate: Moderately high carbonation, relatively full body for a pale lager. Fairly smooth, with a mostly dry finish.

Overall: Well balanced lager that truly shows what Dortmunders are all about. Smooth, crisp body is the highlight, as is the complexity, although there is just a little too much straw and grass flavors for my liking, but that is a minor gripe when the beer is so good.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

4269,"2011-01-30",4.8,"Bottle.  Pours golden with an orange-ish tint.  The head is thin and doesnt retain too well.  The aroma is fresh apples, maybe a little pear, some orange, and a dash of caramel.  It all blends together so well, its intoxicating.  The flavor hits well in all areas.  The citrus notes hit your senses first, then the caramel, then finally, a nice clean hop finish that makes its presence known, but isnt overwhelming.  The mouthfeel is light, bordering on medium.  This brew is substantial in flavor, but light enough to not leave you bloated after 1 or 2.  The ABV is near 6%, which surprises me given the relative lightness in mouthfeel.

This brew is very much on point, and easily my favorite to date.  My only complaint is that its just a tad bit heavy on the carbonation side, and theres not much head to speak of.  Other than that, its just about perfect.","Pennsylvania, USA","KNOFAC"

3.5 A: Clear golden yellow color. Two inches of frothy head with less than average retention and minimal lacing.

4.0 S: Sweet neutral maltiness, not really bready. Faint herbal hop aroma. Not strong, but really elegant aroma.

4.5 T: This is one tasty brew. It has more taste than would be expected in a light colored, low hopped brew. Grainy malts, and to a greater degree, bready malts. Low bitterness and hop flavor, but it works really well.

5.0 M: Medium body. Good carbonation. Really creamy that makes it seems like a heavier body than it is.

4.0 D: It tastes so damn good, but its a little on the sweet side so it reduces the drinkability.

A: Poor a rich dark gold with a single-favor ivory head. A very good amount of carbonation coming up, although it does not appear to be overcarbonated a la many BMC lagers. Other than the colored hue, this is pretty much transparent. Head retention is quite good. 

S: Sweet grains, Batman! The grains come through with a mild sweetness. Slightly hoppy, but the hop aromas are only barely present. 

T: Very rich and slightly sweet, with a definite grain-malt backbone. Very fresh and clean--especially given that this babys best buy date is a mere two weeks away.

The aroma has some spicy hops and some floral hoppy notes with a nice fruity and light bready character. We were talking as we drank this about how good German style lagers tended towards escaping words, in that it is very hard to describe them or compare the aromas or flavors to anything other than those associated directly to the style. My notes for this beer reflect this very well. There is some spicy noble hop presence in the flavor which provide a great bitterness. Not too much bitterness of course in the wonderfully clean lager featuring a light malt sweetness and some nice baguette notes.

I finally acquired and tried a bottle of this after hearing non-RB people have about it for years.  I dont know what they get out of it.  I think both this and the 20th are passable but hardly amazing beers.  On the other hand if this gives Great Lakes the funds to crank out Barrel Aged Blackout Stout and Lake Erie Monster more power to the people who keep them in business.

Aroma / Appearance - The yellowish body was more coppery than golden.  Transparent with a bubbly carbonation it looks like a safe alternative to the fizzy liquid that many people associate with the term ""beer"".  Fresh oak chips and a little bit of hops do not stir any sort of excitement.  A hint of citrus is about as complicated as this gets.

Flavor / Palate - The taste, from start to finish, is just like a teaspoon of honey spread over toasted wheat bread.  Pedestrian with a weak finish you could drink a sixer of these before you figured out what was actually going on.  Theres nothing particularly flawed about it; it just lacks anything special that would make me want to buy a bottle with my own money when so much more flavorful stuff is on the shelf at the same price point.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pilsner malt aroma with some earthy hops, biscuit, straw and grass.

Flavor is very similar to the aroma. Medium bodied yet slightly watered down with some nice earthy hops up front and a sweet pilsner malt backbone that provides excellent balance. There is a nice biscuit graham cracker presence in the malt profile and Im also picking up some subtle faint light crisp fruit, mostly apple and pear. The hops provide a nice bitterness that is prominent up front and lingers above the complex maltiness into a nice dry finish.

4269,"2009-08-04",3.8,"Like the medal which adorns her label, she pours liquid gold into my awaiting lager glass which practically glows from her golden straw brilliance. Make no doubt of it though, there is nothing unnatural or unearthly about this glow unlike some corn-crazy lagers I have come across over the years. A soft cloud of white settles lazily atop fields of golden hay which softly sway in the breeze, carrying a gentle and sweet aroma of ripe grains and Mother Nature. I havent stood in a field of harvesting grains in quite a few years, but I am sure this was what it smelled like in my younger years. Just down the street is a local bakers shop cooking warm fresh loaves of bread from those very same fields of grain while sweet rolls with a warm honey glaze sit already on the shelves for my senses to peruse. Is that lemon tree blossoms I smell in the background? If all my mornings smelled like this getting up would surely not be the chore that it is now. Wasting no time, I dive deep into her golden depths where I am embraced in mouth-coating soft sweet breads dipped in honey fresh from the beekeepers out back. Sweet rolls, butter rolls, white bread, fluffy and still slightly warm from the oven as lemon cream sneaks in for a peppy finish. Her mouthfeel is soft and lightly effervescent, practically floating across my tastebuds just as her cloud of white clings stubbornly to her surface. Only near the last quaff does a more forward bitterness make her presence known, offering a final flourish of perfection.


I now know why the Dortmunder Gold from Great Lakes has won multiple awards over the years with more to come, I am sure. Who needs lagers and pilsners when there is some Dortmunder Gold to be taken home, cradled, loved, and supped. Until Great Lakes makes it to Florida, I shall hopefully continue to savor her multitude of lip-smacking options with continual thanks to my friendly beer-gifters.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Aroma is definitely grassy, but it’s more than that.  There’s a slight citrus rind to it, but the grainy smell is so direct, it’s like I can smell the handful of grain right there.  It’s like rye bread crust.  Taste has the pungent grassy and earth flavor of a pilsner combined with the real subtle toasty toffee note of an O-fest (kinda like how the label says), and it finishes with a fairly distinct caramel flavor.  Buttered toast finishes it out with that rye breadcrust flavor providing a nice aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is light and drinkable but it’s as involved and smooth as you can possibly get in the style.

An odd, dusty pungency of paprika and ground mace washes over pretty heavily, but this isnt really displeasing.  Just weird.  Dry spice and chewy caramel flavor chased by a refreshing pear skin-like bitterness.  Further notes of white toast, honey dipped apples, cotton candy; a vague fruit suggestion seems acerbic but doesnt give much distinct flavor.  Peculiar characteristics are sufficiently reined in by a basic, crisp, crackery malt character thats surprisingly firm.  Recurrent hints of orange rind.  Sprightly, medium body tending to seem thick; lengthy, bittersweet finish of fresh grass and floral honey.

Appearance: Pours a light copper body with a full, lathery white head.

Smell: Bready pilsner malt aroma with a bit of orange zest and spicy, floral hop scents.

Taste: Clean pils malt flavor with a light sweetness, a bit of breadiness, and a slight, subtle hint of juicy orange peel. Flowery, spiced hop flavors with a mild bitterness. Touch of yeast. Drying, crispy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Light, spritzy carbonation.

Drinkability: A very nice, easy drinking Dortmunder. Id say I would have it around regulary, but Great Lakes beers are regrettably unavailable in my state.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

4269,"2007-06-28",3.9,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Pours a transparent, deep brassy golden color with a thick layer of fluffy white head.  Rich light malt aroma that reveals notes of cookie dough and fresh bread, highlighted by some floral violet petals and a subtle whiff of herbal hops.  Medium bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel with a great chewiness without being sticky or sweet.  Wonderfully clean, yet rich maltiness that brings out some creamy cheerios cereal and light toffee.  The carbonation helps lift some of the ""weighty"" pale malts off the palate, tickling it with a pleasing spice/mild acidity sensation.  This transitions cleanly into a refreshing herbal hops final smack.  Very nice sessionable brew.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

4269,"2007-05-14",3.9,"Rated 2/17/06:  Abundant in my neck of the woods, this beer is on tap at most of the local establishments. When in doubt I order a tall one knowing that I will be easily satisfied. Dortmunder Gold is perhaps the most popular of the Great Lakes Brewing Co.s beers, and for good reason as it is well balanced and chances are your bud light drinking buddy will actually like this. In my opinion this is a great beer overall but I prefer many other beers made by this brewer. Pours a clean copper almost light amber color with a full head that tends to simmer down. Strong carbonation and lacing are always present. The aroma is appealing although very mild for my taste. A slight hop aroma is given off just enough to tickle the nose. The flavor is very good and extremely balanced, the malts and hops seem to be in perfect harmony. The mouthfeel is thicker than I expected which is good and this one finishes as strong as it begins, very refreshing and always a treat.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"

4269,"2007-05-05",2.5,"Murky golden in colour, lingering white coloured head, no lacing.  The aroma is of cookie and bready malts, very light caramel sweetness, some apples.

Unfortunately, I was under the weather for most of my stay, so I didnt really get to have much beer other than a bottle of two of this and a couple bottles of Leinenkugels Red...

Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold is clear and golden copper in color.  The carbonation is lively which produces a large white head with good retention and some lacing.  The aroma is grassy and floral with some underlying yeasty maltiness.  The flavor is much like the aroma with a pronounced yet well balanced, fresh hop bitterness.  The finish is a hair dry and resfreshingly crisp.  Even though this brew is well carbonated, it is not overdone or fizzy.  It has a slightly less than medium body.

4269,"2006-11-19",2.9,"Consumed from the bottle. Born-on date is 7/8/06. Decent malty and grainy aroma. Smells a lot like a richer Grain Belt Premium, in my opinion. Flavor is similar to the nose; rich tasting and hearty for a lager. Basically, when a non-beer drinker thinks of the taste of beer, they think of this beer. The beer left a scratchy unpleasantness in the back of my throat and the flavor grew very sharp as the beer warmed. This one is best enjoyed ice cold, I would think. Its a well-crafted lager to be sure, but I cant be non-biased in my review since I do not generally like grainy lagers. This was the worst beer Ive tried by Great Lakes, which is a compliment to the brewery. This beer isnt awful by any means, and more than drinkable for anyone who doesnt like the ""dark"" or ""strong"" beers.","West Bend, Wisconsin, USA","keoki182"

Aroma is very fragrent, showing notes of spicy hops, grassy, floral hops, lightly bready malt, sweat, clean light fruit notes.

Medium-lively carbonation, light bodied without ever getting watery, both the carbonation and spicy hops play with the palate throughout.  Finishes with a crisp bitter floral hops.

Golden bodied (bordering on amber) with a creamy head that became a film in no time. Like a genie, its effervescence happily stated that it was glad to be back out of that bottle.

4269,"2005-01-12",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 30, 2007 Aroma distinctive, somewhat alcoholic.  Taste, kind of interesting.  Not bad at all, and Id take it over most American micros.  However, its not anywhere near close to the quality of the other beers that Great Lakes can produce.  If youre going to shell out enough money to buy their beers (which are pricey), you might as well get your moneys worth and buy something truly outstanding like the Burning River, Edmund Fitzgerald, or if you want a softer beer, the Locktender Lager or Conways Irish Ale.  Another thing thats a little strange about this brew...this is my opinion, but I swear it tastes exactly the same whether its on tap or in a bottle.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","cazort"

Well balanced throughout, finish is on the semi dry side and has a clean aftertaste that is lightly herbal hop.  Lighter bodied, smooth, creamy m/f, medium carbonation.  Overall not a bad beer, but I wish theyd go back to letting it sit on the yeast a little longer and stop trying to turn it out so quickly.

Very well balanced between malt and hops, Im not sure I can descibe it better than the commercial description.  I do want to note that compared to other more complex beers, this does not ""wow"" me, but Im not sure thats what this beer is trying to be.

Aroma, neutral, a bit grainy, right on for the average lager, airy and inoffensive. Nice enough.
Taste: smoooth, mild, big and malty, little hops on the palate, but everything slides very easily down. Grainy taste is easily met by light fruit, the body is medium, finish is long and lasting. Flavor sits forever in the mouth, thats is the biggest thing this brew has going for it. Its not one of those In-&-out-lagers, in the mouthfeel. big points for that, for the persistence, and the pleasure, and the all-out pleasant-ness going on here. If I were somewhere where this was the most intriquing selection, though Im no lager lover, its a beer I could happily sit with. Or stand, even.

Pours a rich golden orange.  No sediment and very clear.  Aroma is sharp and spicy.  Good amount of white foamy head.
Begins very powerfully, with lots of strong, sharp yeast/hops flavor right away. However, there is an undercurrent of dry, flat grain taste that makes its way out shortly after the hops flavor has worn off.  The beer takes on too much a watery texture, especially as it warms.  I also found that the powerful up front taste gets very old after a few of these.  Not complex at all. Medium acidity.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The Great Lakes Dortmunder is my personal favorite in this style of brew and is one of the easiest drinking (bitter) beers around. Ive found it to be extremely enjoyable on its own, with appetizers, and even with a meal, particularly fish dishes such as halibut or grilled prawns.

Bread, English hop, toast, and fruit are evenly distributed throughout this clean and, almost, boastful aroma.  Dough and brown sugar provide a sweetness that suffices to be a dessert beer.  Yet quenching enough to be a session beer and hoppy enough to arouse an appetitie.  Medium carbonation and redidual caramel sweetness combine to provide a perfect feel.

Or is that my pinhead at the end of a grueling term? Anyway, toasty, malty, excellent aroma, a touch of maybe Saaz. Most folks here say full-bodied, and I agree...for a lager this is exceptionally well-built. Crisp. I have to let it warm and see if it retains that flavor and crispness, as VENOM claims.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
4269,"2002-04-10",4.5,"Excellent - the best loved Great Lakes brew in Cleveland, Dortmunder Gold takes this obscure style to a new level.  Very drinkable and immediately satisfying, it serves as Great Lakes flagship beer.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","chug18799"
4269,"2002-04-07",2.9,"Light golden color.  Light everything.  Light, fruity hop nose.  Faint fruity hop tastes.  Okay.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"

4269,"2002-03-08",4.5,"Wow!!  My bell has been rung!  The folks at Great Lakes Brewing arent taking any prisoners.  I cant believe something this good is coming out of Cleveland.   
This well crafted brew could quickly become habit forming.   This brew pours a medium
hazy amber with a small amount of body particles.  The huge frothy bone colored head is
fully lasting and has excellent lacing - in a word; outstanding.  The aroma is very fresh. 
The nose is moderately malty with hints of sweet cereal, ultralight in the hop department,
and lightly yeasty with hints of soap.  There was a nice balance
between the three - in a word stellar.    The flavor is unbelievably balanced; moderately sweet and bitter
initially with a moderately sweet and bitter finish of longish duration.  The palate is perfect
with medium to full body, creamy soft texture, and a clean dry astringency to the finish.  This
beer has body, if you cant feel it, youre spending too much time looking at the glass.  I
keep thinking little sips, little sips because of the cost - but I feel myself deeply desiring
to quaff this beer.  I finally have an accurate understanding of the word imbibe.   Think
liquid crack but cheaper.  Drink at your own risk!!!","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"
4269,"2002-02-18",3.0,"Not their best but not awful either. Im a huge lager fan and this stuff isnt cheap enough to drink while cooking bratwurst, but not good enough to drink alone. Ive bought it in the past, and may well buy it again, but there are other brews at better prices i prefer. Full bodied lager that has little head, light finish, feels weird drinking it on a Summers da,y but not right ofr winter either.... February 29th beer maybe?","Toledo, Ohio, USA","LuckeyHaskins99"
4269,"2002-02-10",3.9,"Really liked this lager.  Distinct but good flavor, a lot different than most beers, good for a change.","grand blanc, Michigan, USA","SpecialBrew99"

4269,"2001-12-03",4.3,"A very nice beer. Flavorful, hoppy-ish, I could drink this over and over again. I am starting to realize I like the Great Lakes Brewing Co. I wrote that on 4/27/01 with a 3.8 rating... Im increasing my rating. This is a very good beer.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","jstu9"
4269,"2001-11-25",4.1,"I really enjoyed this American effort at a European style. Very malty, but with an oaty-graininess that keeps it in check. Well-balanced and dry towards the end. Emminently quaffable, even compulsively so.  Thanks Trappist Ales Rule, another winner from Great Lakes!","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
4269,"2001-11-25",4.1,"Healthy head with a nice apricot color. Wonderful aroma. Friendly to the palate. Very well balanced and tasty. Seemed a little overly carbonated in the finish, but at least it was clean. Overall, a rather enjoyable and easy-to-drink brew... yet another great Great Lakes beer.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

4269,"2001-10-25",3.5,"A nice Dortmunder lager but Ive never been one to jump on the bandwagon of Great Lakes just for the sake of jumping. While its true their beers offer good fresh flavor, I prefer the Select Lager from Great Lakes crosstown rival Crooked River. Dortmunder Gold has a good balance of malt and hops and is enjoyable in every way...but is it really worth the higher price? Once they passed the $7.00 mark for a 6-pack I think they started thinking more of their product than they have the right to.","Maineville, Ohio, USA","Beer Guy99"

very smooth and hasa nice hop/malt balance.

4269,"2001-09-05",4.1,"Holy Cow!  A friend and I powered through a six of this while playing music in the backyard and sure wished we had more.  Ive definitely used the word balanced cavalierly in earlier reviews because this brew defines the word - both a generous malt and a strong hoppy presence - and such a great feel in the mouth.  By far the best lager Ive ever had.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
4269,"2001-09-03",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2003 A great beer from one of the best american breweries. They know how to make one hell of a beer over at the great lakes brewery. This has a robust solid flavor to it. It is smooth without being weak. An great beer. Very cool how they managed to balance the malts and hops to come out with a very smooth brew.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
4269,"2001-09-02",4.4,"Whereas i didnt care as much for the Eliot Ness, i could drink this one all day. Excellent balance, tasty malt flavor, and nice hop finish. Very easy to drink and went great with dinner. Great aroma and fairly long lasting head. Great beer.","Jeannette, Pennsylvania, USA","dolemike1"

This is not in the same class as Great Lakes Burning River brew which is outstanding.","Jacksonville, North Carolina, USA","Saad"
