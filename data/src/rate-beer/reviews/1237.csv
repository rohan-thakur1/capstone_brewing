1237,"2015-11-18",3.7,"A brilliant, dark amber beer with offwhite medium sized head. 
initial aromas are light caramel, rose petal, and a bit of bread and candy. not extremely aromatic, but sweet smells do come through.

flavor is dominated by sweet toffee and bitter hops in the finish. hop character is very noticeable for this doppelbock, and overall, the malt character leans more towards this being a double maibock as opposed to the salvator side of the spectrum. 

finish is bitter and crisp. mouthfeel is oily and not sticky. hop character seems fresh and very continental.

1237,"2012-04-05",3.0,"This is a beer Ive wanted to try for a number of years but never found on my travels: I discovered it in Aufsturz, Berlin: it isnt on their normal beer menu but I spied a small selection of bottles on one of the bar tops and decided to investigate the laid out presentation, this was one of the brews on offer.

500ml Bottle: dark ruby red body with a thin off-white head, the beer was clear and clean looking.

The smells were of malty molasses, caramel aromas that indicated the beer was going to be a very sweet Doppelbock indeed.

The smells didnt lie, this is sweet and malty (in that order): almost sticky in consistency and mouthfeel. I like the sweeter, maltier brews out there, but this tested my resolve: I really enjoyed the first half of the tasting, but as the beer warmed in the glass my pleasure began to recede somewhat.

The aroma was of a toasted light bread malt and a sweet doughy yeast with notes of toffee, caramel, dark fruit (cherries and plums) and also had a mild nuttiness to it.

The taste was lightly sweet with a note of toffee early on and then had a nice bold maltiness come on board with notes of caramel, dark fruit and an ever so mild taste of alcohol. The flavor hung around for only a short while with a sweet fruity taste that was left to fade away rather quickly.

Mouthfeel was just above light in body and had a kind of watery texture with a moderate carbonation.

1237,"2012-03-16",3.1,"Bottle (500ml):
Roasted malts and very light caramel smell to this one initially along with some dark fruits such as figs and sugar with some chocolate.

Light mahogany with a bubbly, two finger sized head that fades to nothing fast.

Roasted malts to begin with along with a rich, dark fruity taste and a lot of sweetness. There is hints of figs again and a tiny bit of chocolate with a little bitterness too.

Smooth, medium, bordering on a full body. The carbonation levels are high, it was also a very sweet tasting beer.

This was a fairly ordinary beer and not really worth a second look despite the good name of the brewery. Not one to go out of your way to try but give it a bash if you spot it in your local.

Lovely nose, big dark fruit notes, especially prunes, raisins, dates and dried cherries. Ludicrous that this should emanate from a lager! Vivid and luscious, recalling licorice and Sees candies along with dried fruit. The flavor departs a bit from the fruitiness to showcase creamy caramel and molasses, but theres still a significant unripe raisin note. Theres a slight metallic tinge as well, but its not nearly as prominent as in some lesser doppelbocks and the subtlety actually works okay with the other flavors. I dont get any alcohol on the palate at all, which is great. Its obviously there but the only evidence is a slight warmth, a slight oiliness, and a slight buzz. Finishes dry for a chewy beer (much appreciated). This is honestly up there with Celebrator. I cant believe how good this is. Bravo.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

Wonderful smell! Fruity, dark, roasty, sweet; eloquently doppebock. Mild alcohol catches the nose slightly with multiple whiffs.

Taste follows the smell. It is a mighty doppelbock though the tried and true Salvator still reigns supreme. It is nice and smooth, perfect carbonation for the style. The flavors attack with a bite, this one is no-holds-barred. Alcohol creeps in with the sweetness. A rich tasting brew.

It pours a deep amber color with a foamy, light tan head.  The nose is malty with dark fruit notes, a bit of paper, dark honey, and a slight vegetative note.  The flavor is sweet, but not cloying.  Lighter on the palate than I was expecting.  And a touch dry.  A bit of dark honey, plum, tea, spice, vanilla, and a slight metallic note.  The flavor profile seems a bit muted making me think this brew has passed its prime.  One more reason there should be dating on all bottles.  Medium body with a slightly dry mouthfeel and a medium, fruity finish.  Certainly a fairly solid example of the style and worth having if you are a fan of bocks.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

Filtered body is a dark garnet-mahogany.Strong melanoidins provide a plethora of sweet and sour dark fruits, with aged toffee and even light molasses tartness.  Black pepper and vanillin notes are mostly tucked away but point to the filtration and pasteurization.  Chocolate and coffee practically fly out of the glass, especially as it warms, providing a very enjoyable balance to the breadiness and tart fruitiness.  If it just had a bit more yeast character (its too clean and austere, I think), without the pasteurization, it could really be special.  Medium-high strength of aroma, no alcohol noted.Shockingly flavorful and very well-attenuated, with most of the dark fruits (currants, blackberries, raisins) adding the flavor.  Chocolate and light caramel-coffee notes stem from the malt and an elegant oiliness on the palate rounds things out.  But as the aroma suffers from filtration/pasturizatoin, so does the body, being too loose/thin on the end, and without the softness/suppleness of natural carbonation.  Too bad German brewers never adopted the art of bottle conditioning, like the Belgians (though granted lagers and bottle conditioning are a whole different ballgame).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Taste; starts off a little earthy and then becomes sweet with molasses, brown sugar and some hints of dark fruits. Some toasted malts and chocolate come out in the finish, and the fruits become a bit more defined as this warms with figs and raisins.

Shared with new-found backpacker friends,  I found I only got slops on what was said to be one of the last bottles. Mention alcohol percentage in a beer and suddenly you are swarmed by youthful tourists pretending to be your longtime mates - well not really, Im just a generous bugger. Into a pilsner flute. Poured a deep copper brown, quite bright , with a tidy pad of white forming, but later dying of to nothing (glass was second-use). Heady, poignant, sticky-date pudding and peat-malt nose with a claspy, nutty edge that didnt at all aid to swerve from its dessert-like aromatics. Surprisingly, the alcohol tickles and doesnt hide. Rum, raisin and hefty malts. 
 Sticky, heavy palate that acts like a liqueur up against the lagers of the day. Its syrupy and smooth, a good level of sweetest toffee, tangy orange-peels,  burnt fruit, and a rasp of vine-clippings work to make it pleasurable.

There was a nice alcohol warmth that built toward the end as well.","Wichita, Kansas, USA","henry3r"
1237,"2006-08-24",4.4,"Bottle, Chef Pauls Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL.  Enjoyed as desert after a tasty Rouladen I was surprised and impressed with this Doppel!  It poured into the dimpled mug a very dark brown with some ruby highlights and was crested with a smallish tan head that would leave a little lacing.  A sweet aroma of brown sugar in this very malty brew.  Some sweet gruit was also detectable as it warmed up.  Taste was very sweet upfront, but pleasantly so.  It developed into a satisfying body of malt that had a nutty richness to it and was countered by just a touch of biterness before finishing smooth and exceptionally rich with a playful tingle on the tongue.  This was exceptional!","Naperville, Illinois, USA","kseecs16"
1237,"2006-08-08",4.0,"Bottle (from Bitter Virtue, BB Aug 06). Deep mahogany brown. Light roast, caramel, molasses, liquorice, bready malts, earthy hop and subtle fruits in the complex nose.

Not too sweet and uses its strength to good effect. Considerably better than its namesake Amsterdam Maximator!","Southampton, Hampshire, ENGLAND","Mungo"

Smaller 330ml bottle dragged back from Vintage Estate, and Im chuffed at the find.  Nose is throwing out huge dark, deep, earthy caramel form the neck, and its even better in the glass after some agitation.  Beautiful deep ruby-mahogany body with a short tan head.  Mmmm, rich, Munich-heavy, dense malt is just incredible (and relatively dry, which threatens to induce a fainting spell!), recalling the gooiest of candy bar chocolate, caramel, nougat stretching from wrapper to teeth, but without the sugar.  In this one, the fruit is late-arriving and less of a star, though the cherry, red berry, and grape are all high-quality and sparkle in their own right.  No, its the thick malt, with molasses, raisin, perhaps a touch of mild rum, that shines more than any other time Ive had this, syrupy and filling with pump crusts, just a light prickle of sufficient carbonation and milder lemon to take the edge off.  Have had thousands of beers in between but never expected this kind of reunion!  [2016.07.30: 4.8]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

1237,"2006-06-03",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 11, 2006 A very nice doppelbock. Poured a dark red-brown color with a nice but not too big tan head. Lacing was minimal. Aroma was musty and malty, somewhat sweet vinous with some dark fruits coming through. The most surprising feature of the flavor was the nutty taste that came through, almost like a nut brown doppelbock (I was expecting some coffee - although I didnt detect any in the aroma - per word from my good friend, doulos). This didnt have enough hop balance or as creamy a mouthfeel to take out Ayingers Celebrator as #1 Doppel, but it was very nice anyway. Re-rate, Sept. 06: Deep burgundy brown color with a slow developing tan head. Little chocolate, grassy hops, and some dark fruits (figs and raisins). The flavor was like the aroma, decent hop balance, although more malty than hoppy. Not too sweet, though, a very competent doppelbock, which does well among the best (vs. Celebrator, Andechser, Liberator).","","User37895"

1237,"2006-01-25",5.0,"Augustiner Maximator pours to a deep, bright, chestnut brown color with a creamy off white head, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is stunning. Deep, toasty, sweet malty, and nutty waves of aroma flood the nose. The palate is hefty, and chewy with big sweet malty flavors paired with more toasty and nutty character. This beer ends with more big malt up front, then is balanced with just enough hop presence so this beer isnt cloying. This is paired with a high octane, soothing, warming burn. 

Without a doubt one of the finest examples of dopple bock on the market today, and a true bench mark for this style. This beer is hard to find, but if you are lucky enough to find it here in America, snap it up, and as much as you can. Dopple bocks are rich, strong brews that will stand up to some age. You wont be able to put too much age on it, as you will want to drink it. This beer is suited more for the colder months, but makes the perfect night cap, and would work well with deserts. I would pair this one with creme brulee, but would much rather enjoy this beer by itself. This beer truly is a ""mash tun in a glass"", an is a flawless example of dopple bock. I cant not praise this beer enough.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

1237,"2003-03-19",4.2,"Nice dark color that wasn't to terribly dark.Aroma was malty with some coffee,chocolate,and raisan in it.Flavor was definately big and syrupy,sweet malt,raisan with a hint of prune in it.nice sweet finish with a dark roasted malt aftertaste that is very pleasant.Still this is one of those brews that cost so much that it's a once in a blue moon trial,but very well done.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"

1237,"2003-02-19",3.8,"Dark reddish brown. Aroma is malty and sweet. Flavor is sweet with molasses or perhaps brown sugar. This is a pretty good doppelbock. I was impressed. I was sceptical because of the labeling and how it's on the bottle crooked. But this was a quality brew.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","Yankovitch333"
1237,"2003-01-28",3.3,"Sweet and tangy malts. Molasses and brown sugar, bit of raisins. Some hops and worty, licorice. In all, nice aroma. Small tan head, thin with no lacing. Color of flat dark root beer. Medium high carb. Body is heavy watery to chewy. Taste is malty and kind of sweet up front. Hops come in to finish, but overall a bit watery albeit flavorful. Taste doesn't hang around and very little after - a dull sweetness. An OK doppelbock but doesn't really ""grab"" you.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"
1237,"2003-01-28",4.6,"i´m not a big doppelbock fan but this really agreed with me. certainly beats amsterdam maximator. burnt amber with a big soapy head. aroma starts as salted raisins with some paint stripper, salted licorice, chocolate and Lynx Africa. taste started burnt-bitter, burnt lychees and then smoothed - some brandy, and finishes with burnt black bean and rotten peach. texture softens - Allowrie butter. great stuff - a bottle of this was a journey","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
1237,"2003-01-24",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2003  This is a typical quality dopplebock, body is much better than Paulaner and Spaten stuff lately. Salvator looks and tastes more like a deep marzen/bock than the old black stuff. Stick with this or Celebrator of the widely available German DBocks.","Dallas, Texas, USA","DallasBryan"
1237,"2003-01-13",3.8,"Dark ruby brown color with only a small edge head.  Thick, malty nose with a mild roasted caharacter.  Lots of bread and sticky sweetness.

1237,"2002-06-19",4.0,"I found it to be fairly creamy and easy to drink. It wasnt bitter as some darker beers often are, and I found it to be one of the few dark beers outside of the British Isles that impressed me. May not be in the top tier, but definately worth checking out as one of the German beers.","Ohio, USA","Gunshy"
1237,"2002-06-18",4.1,"deep tootsie-roll brown; with a head the color of old newspaper,  ample and responsive . big pumpernickel malt nose, a delight for us malt-heads: figs and turkish coffee, old steamer trunks and absynthe. just a trace of wet leaves from the forest floor suggesting a rather mature bottle--if you took this beer to the movies it would qualify for a discount.  still spry though with a sweet coffee flavor, crisp palette, full bodied enough to stretch out your cheeks like dizzy gillespie. a touch more hops would make it orally orgasmic, they register just enough bitterness to keep it from being a runaway malt orgy.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"
1237,"2002-06-04",4.2,"Big molasses/dark fruit aroma, the head quickly goes away, starts with a fizzy palate, but quickly becomes less so.  Similar to, although (IMHO) not as good as Celebrator.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"

1237,"2002-05-26",3.6,"I dont quite get the average rating of 3.94.  I picked this one up because it ended in ator and was labelled as dark, so I could only assume its a Doppelbock, which I like when done really well.  This reminds me a lot of the H.C. Berger Dopplebock . . . sweet, and flat.  (And, yes, the Berger is really spelled Dopplebock.)  Nice, sweet, coffee-like (and fruit-like) touch in the aroma, but like the Berger, it falls flat for the most part elsewhere.  Nice flavor, but just really flat.  Brownish-black color, pretty standard for a good doppel.  Head disappears very quickly.  I have to warn you: if you dont like highly sweet beers, you wont like this.  I like it myself, but I like sweet beers.  But it disappoints to the extent that it doesnt have a robustness to it that you get in the Ayinger Celebrator or Weltenburger Asam-Bock, the only two doppels Ive tried that really impress me.  Like the Berger, Id put this around a 3.5.  Actually may not be as flat as the Berger, but still could have been crafted better.  Alcohol content is pretty pleasing, though.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"
1237,"2002-05-25",3.8,"I was introduced to this beer by an employee at my local ale merchant.  I was in the process of purchasing some Celebrator (never having tried it) and he told me that this was better and cheaper to boot.  I have to admit that it is less expensive, but definitely not better.  Still, I like the maltiness.  The hops are hidden ... I almost wonder if the bitterness isnt a derived from the malt.  I like this beer.  It is quintessentially German.  But I wouldnt recommend it to everyone.  It takes a familiarity and appreciation of German styles to really enjoy.  Still, I would love to quaff a few of these around Octoberfest season.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"
1237,"2002-03-08",4.4,"Wow, simply wonderful. Dark, malty, fruity complexity with a kick but a smooth finish that hides the alcohol. Wish i could get my hands on more but not sold in Oregon, thanks to my friend Mike for bringing me this.","Portland, Oregon, USA","AxeMaster221"

1237,"2001-09-07",4.1,"Very pretty dark brown, with a great head. Slight roasty metallic taste that detracts from it, however, it has many redeming qualities. Medium mouthfeel. Light, caramel/sweet taste.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
1237,"2001-09-04",4.4,"Second only to Celebrator.  Lush prune and chocolate aroma accompany the malty prune, plum, and chocolate flavors.  Dark cherry red with little head, alcohol was detectable but otherwise a non-factor before the slightly bitter, coffee-grind, hop and yeast finish. Kudos also for the body, which could have been syrupy and cloying, but instead was near-perfectly suave.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
