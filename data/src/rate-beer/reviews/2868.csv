2868,"2017-04-15",4.7,"Thanks Huhzubendah for sharing the bottle! Poured into a taster into a hazy dull yellow with sparse white foam lacing. The nose shows lightly tart notes of tangerine, brett, and a light vanilla background. These notes are intense and juicy yet so beautifully composed together. The palate is medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Highly tart with refreshing flavors of bright and dry tangerine and light brett funk. No acetic edge but with light citrus notes. Finish is a resurgence of refreshing citrus and tangerine.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

Flavour is quite tart with more powder candy, red plum, light yoghurt, semi-sweet pale malt and fruit, fairly funky, with a light oaky dryness building into the finish. Mouthfeel is powdery and mineral with light carbonation. The powder candy association was amusing but not at all unpleasant, and the fruit was well-integrated with the character of the base beer here.

2868,"2016-10-03",3.8,"Flora Plum batch 2

Pours a hazed peach pulp colored beer with a dense, stable head to it.

Has a floral barnyard characteristic on the nose, consisting of wet hay, wild flowers, fresh plugged mushrooms, lemon pulp, leather and in this case fruity, sour plums. The plums got an awesomly intriguing appearance on the nose, with a soft stone quality coming through, together with a sweeter note, resulting from the plum skin. 

Very silk on the tongue, this provides a soft, acidic driven plum richness from the start till the end, with a pleasant, fruity sweet note cutting through the tartness.

Tastes of hay and a stony mineral quality together with a lemony, funky tartness, revealing dust and leather, but also a flowery aspect. Plums get detectable once the initial, pungent tartness dies down by revealing an enjoyable, bright fruit pulp sweetness among prickly lemon and an aqueous softness. Finishes with more lemon, a late plum pulp sweetness and its initial flowery quality.

Comes well together with an enjoyable plum presence, bringing quite a few facetts to the foundation of the beer, without dominating the taste. Light bodied, very tart and aqueous during the finish.","GERMANY","aleigator"

2868,"2016-03-21",4.0,"375 mL bottle at the brewery, 3/18/16.Moderately hazy, soft golden-straw colored body is topped by an initially large, white head that steadily fades to cover.Very elegant aroma, much like regular flora though with perhaps a bit less soft funk and a touch more lactic and brett acids. The plum has been pretty well homogenized with the rest of the beer, and I certainly would be hard-pressed to pick it out blind. Soft wood and light honey notes behind the acids and fruitiness. As usual, much of what is great about this beer is what it lacks. For an American wild ale/sour, it doesnt have an acetic edge and the wood is reserved (no heavy oak). The malts are nicely attenuated and mostly sit in the background. No alcohol or flaw.In the flavor, its decidedly fruity, with light malt and plum sugars up front drying out heavily and leaving plum skin and lactic acid on the end. Brett acidity is fairly strong and the carbonation is mostly tight/engaging. Very enjoyable, easy-drinking stuff that isnt flashy or heavily sour. Still, I like the unadulterated funk of the regular Flora; the fruit doesnt really add much for me here.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2868,"2015-09-23",4.3,"Big thanks to Seth for the share. This is a really nice iteration of Flora with fruit in it, theres this little hint of fruity sweetness in the middle alongside a tartness and funk and lemony/grassy/wheaty character. Just a good, well-balanced, flavorful beer.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
2868,"2015-09-08",4.4,"Poured from a bottle. 
Aroma is really nice and plum forward. Really great fruit notes with some light oak character and hints of tropical fruit and citrus. 
Pours a very hazy, cloudy, pale peach color with a small, thick white head that recedes to the edges where it lingers. Medium lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is fairly acidic with a hint of citrus. Fairly strong plum notes that work really well with the the acidity. Medium light bitterness and faint oak. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a great beer with a lot of fruit character. The plum works shockingly well, and better than a lot of other fruits. People should try using more plums in beer.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

2868,"2015-05-16",4.4,"Bottle (375 ml). Shared by czar, thanks!

Appearance: Slightly hazy bright pale yellow-golden with salmon reflects, a medium white head and good lacing. 

Aroma: Very similar to the ""regular"" Flora with bright winey notes and tartness along the HF bugs that theres now in most of their Saison, mild oak and eathy notes... but theres also a wonderful and delicate plum presence. 

Taste: Bright tartness along plums, bright winey notes, mild oak presence, light fruit sweetness, juicy, mild earthiness and very mild spiciness.

Palate: Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Winey mouthfeel. Moderately dry and tart finish. Mild lingering plum aftertaste. 

Overall: Its by far the best of the fruited Flora so far and my second favorite, only behind Flora b5, in all the Flora/Florence series. So delicate and drinkable while being incredibly complex and tasty. Flora is shining and the fruits are playing a perfect second violon role. Perfect balance. Its the first fruited version where the fruits compliments the Flora instead of hiding it. Amazing!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2868,"2015-05-14",4.3,"Bottle shared. Vibrant hazy gold pour with nice white head. Aroma is really nice flora with light fruity notes, fleshy plum aromas, light winey notes.

2868,"2015-05-14",4.5,"Bottle. Pours a hazy pink with light golden hues. Minimal eggshell head. Light lace. Aromas of wet oak, musty grape, under-ripe plums, light earth, light barnyard. Taste is incredible! A nice light balanced sour note hits with the fruit out of the gate. Nothing too overpowering, but prominent. Plum stays on the palate and provides a nice sweet middle ground where the soft mouthfeel and medium carbonation let wet oak and some barnyard notes move in. Finishes semi-dry, semi-sweet and semi-sour...just a wonderful harmony. My favorite of the fruited Floras so far!","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"
