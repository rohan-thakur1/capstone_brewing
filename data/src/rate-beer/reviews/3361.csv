3361,"2016-09-06",4.0,"Draught at the Fermentaria, 8/27/16.Another heavily hazy, approaching soupy, golden-lemon-rind colored beer with a medium-sized white head atop, showing moderate retention.Juicy, grassy, spicy and only moderate citric notes in the nose show peach, orange juice and pineapple, with strong biscuity malts behind it. I wouldnt call it a juice bomb, on account of the dry, grainy malt, but its certainly headed that way. I do appreciate the graininess of the malt, however, as it adds a crisp, balancing element without having to use a ton of hop bitterness. Id also like to point out that this is all cascade hops. Absolutely wild. Chalk me up as being very shocked. No alcohol or flaw.Good malty texture and tight carbonation with a chewy rye character to it and lots of grain and spice. Fruitiness is high and the hops add plentiful orange juice, lemon rind, peach and light pineapple. Theres certainly no lack of flavor here and it doesnt seem thin or watered down. Good dryness and yet maltiness at the same time, with biscuity malts and chewy rye notes. Low to moderate bitterness with no alcohol, resin or flaw.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3361,"2016-08-21",3.9,"4 oz sample from the source. Bright yellow. Aroma is grapefruit, pine and a weak grassy note. The flavor shows a rye backbone with the hop variety displayed bery nicely. Orange, garpefruit in a juciy texture through the center bit tirns dry in the finish. This has unbelievable flavor for an brew under 4% ABV. Perfect for a humid August afternoon. Unreal display of a session IPA.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3361,"2016-08-15",3.7,"On tap at the Fermentaria. It pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma was very floral. The flavor was dry and flowery with a touch of grapefruit. Low to medium bitterness. Pale, dry and light bodied. Good.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3361,"2016-07-17",3.4,"UPDATED: JUL 17, 2016 Draft at Strangeloves. Very cloudy orange pour with soapy white froth. Orange juice. Oak tannins. Grassy. Fruit loops. Tang. Full-bodied. Modestly-hopped. Not much ABV. Works as a decent juicy session but not nearly as complex as its name.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","NikkTwist"
3361,"2016-07-14",3.8,"Sampled at the Ferm, pours murky orange golden with medium white head. Notes of grass, light pine, orange, and some minerals. A touch dull as she sits but when you add some hops or cannabis back into her, shes a dreamboat. Ill take anything hoppy thats under 5 percent when its 95 degrees and humid as hell outside. Feels like a concrete jungle out here. Gross","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3361,"2016-07-13",3.8,"Pours a hazy golden orange with a thick white head. Aroma mangos, passion fruit and grain. Taste is grain, citrus and tropical fruit. I cant believe this is 3.3 abv","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","jcartamdg"
3361,"2016-07-10",3.4,"Draft. Light golden pour with white head. Herbal, grassy and light citrus hop aromas. Flavors are herbal, grassy and citrus, no body to speak of.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
3361,"2012-09-29",3.7,"POurs a cloudy straw hay color with a small white head. Aroma is spicy, rye, pepper, nicew, little grassy. Taste is refreshing, rye, spice, refreshing. A very nice low ABV beer that works perfectly as a session beer. Very full and tastefull considering the ABV! =)","Linköping, SWEDEN","Tinco"
3361,"2012-09-29",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 30, 2012 Draft at tired hands with pat, Dallas and ann. Pours a clear golden body with white lacing. Aroma is super dank herb, funky citrus and light grassy hop. Awesome. Mouthfeel is medium to thin, lightly crisp with notes of light rye, grass, bitter pineapple and faint bitter hop.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
3361,"2012-09-29",3.5,"Pale glowing golden with a white head. Aroma is soft and citrus floral. Light body. Not a flavor powerhouse as to be expected with the abv. Next to no finish. Solid but a little too faint.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
3361,"2012-09-26",4.2,"On tap it pours mostly clear, a bit hazy yellow in color with a big creamy white head. The aroma is like a juicy sweet orange in the nose, the Cascade hops are showcased quite well here. There are bitter orange grapefruit flavors from the hops as well making it quite excellent for a pale ale. The body is better than decent and it ends smooth and dry.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
3361,"2012-09-23",3.8,"Tap at Tired Hands. Clear gold with a dense pillowy white head. Excellent retention. Nose is fresh pineapple and tropical grassy hops. But a good dose of butter. Blood orange and fresh lemongrass comes through. Taste brings ginger and lemongrass with white grapefruit peel. Moderate grassy bitterness. Fresh and zippy palate. Lighter body. Very very dry.

3361,"2012-09-18",4.0,"On tap at Tired Hands. Poured a hazy golden color with a smaller sized head. Aromas of floral hops, rye, citrus, and pine. Tastes of toast, bread, floral, grass, and citrus. Very nice and at 3.5%, could drink this one all day long...","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"

Taste of citrus, pine resin, toasted malts, grass, grapefruit with a hoppy finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
3361,"2012-09-15",4.1,"Growler from THB, shared at my tasting group. Pours a slightly opaque pale yellow with nice head that fades. Nose is juicy sweet citrus fruit like ripe meyer lemons but touch of rye does come through. first sip is similar with nice orange peal bitterness in the finish crazy drinkable.","Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, USA","Macegan75"
3361,"2012-09-14",4.2,"[Tap] at the brewpub. Pours hazy gold with a soapy eggshell head. Aroma is super fresh hand crushed hop cones, floral rye, citrusy, a little doughy yeast, pencil shavings, and washed rind cheese. The flavor is floral hops, a bit of rye spice, a fair bit of bitterness, and absolutely no sweetness. Unreal beer for 3.5%. Well done.

3361,"2012-09-13",4.0,"Pours a pale yellow with a medium white head.  Aroma has light, fresh pine, some citrus, and grass.  Flavor is citrus forward...some orange, grass, and faint soft pine.  Mouthfeel is light/medium and silky with a dry bitter/grapefruity finish.","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"
3361,"2012-09-13",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2013 Hazy golden yellow body. Medium white head and nice sticky lacing. Assertive grapefruit bitterness and lemon citric notes.  One dimensional in a very good way. First sip was shockingly thin--but I think it was just my mind fucking with me as my palate attempted to understand how a beer at 3.5 abv could be this bitter.  Each successive sip was nice. If you like cascade this is a gem.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
