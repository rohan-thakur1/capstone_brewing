975,"2016-05-09",3.8,"Draught at Spuyten Duyvil, 4/16/16.Hazy, dull bronze/brass golden body is quite pale/muted and topped by a moderate amount of white head showing modest to strong retention.Lots of easygoing brett in the nose is immediately charming/easy to get along with. Its lightly fruity (lime zest, strawberries, guava) and only moderately funky (light band-aids and such) and not outdone by the hops, thankfully, which are here quite spicy and yet reserved. Doesnt feel any bit like the new breed of heavily Americanized brett beers. Malt provides dry biscuity character and there are light pepper phenols on the end, as well as more citrus and very light sour fruit-like candy notes. No alcohol or flaw.The flavor is heavily directed by the brett, being quite tart, moderately acidic, but nowhere biting or over-dry. Good attenuation, with leafy, earthy, woodsy hops (and very minor pine accents) and some more easygoing citrus notes (lime zest, meyer lemon). Light honey-like maltiness balances easily, while the carbonation is light to moderate and engaging. Some oiliness/slickness on the end, with a bit of bread and candy-like character are the only detractors, but otherwise a very lovely belgian pale/ipa with brett.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
