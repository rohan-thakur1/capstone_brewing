822,"2017-03-18",3.1,"Huge lasting offwhite/beige head. Clear still deep dark brownish red body. Resiny pineapple aroma with wooden notes. The pineapple feels acidic and unclean. Sweetish spicy orange peel taste with caramelly notes. Mid-to-full body. Mild, soft, light carbonation mouthfeel. Dryish-sweet spicy orange-peel aftertaste with smoky notes. Unusual and interesting.

822,"2016-07-22",3.8,"33cl bottle I brought back from Barcelona and the European Summer Gathering. Poured (twice) into an old Veltins Pilsner tulip at home during a random tasting evening with myself. Pours a misty, dull orange, on top an uneven, white head. Fruity hops lead the way in both the aroma and taste, with a good bitter bite in the flavour: no citrus notes! Big Bonus Point for that. This is a live tasting and I have only just realised it is 8.2% ABV, wondered why I was getting a buzz from it. Bugger, first beer of the evening.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"
822,"2016-07-06",3.5,"From latiendadelacerveza. In Teku glass. At dinner, with biscotte + mackerel. Misses some hops-punch in taste and aroma for the style (maybe they didnt use very fresh hops?), but its very drinkable, with its ABV very well hidden. Bb date Feb 2018.","SPAIN","josanguapo"

822,"2016-05-22",3.5,"Bottle @ LIBF16. Shared with the RB Belgian team.
Dorée, fin orange, col blanc.
Arôme est malté centré sur le pils avec un rétro fruité tropical des houblons qui apporte un bouquet intéressant sur une pils.
Palais est léger, malté, pointe citronné et agrumes pour un rappel pamplemousse. Un mélange qui tranche bien avec ce profil lager. La caractère malté pils - pâle est convenable et laisse ample place aux houblons tout en conservant cette approche plus pils impériale.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
