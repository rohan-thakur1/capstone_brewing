The nose shows brett with notes of horse blanket and upon warming up, a strong background of hibiscus and lime. 

The palate is medium bodied and highly carbonated. Moderately tart with light hibiscus and rose petals followed by a white wine bitterness on the finish and lime on the resurgence. Not very keen on the white wine bitterness but still a relatively interesting beer.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

3836,"2016-11-01",3.9,"750ml bottle purchased at Hill Farmstead. Pours rosey with a tint of red wine and slight grapefruit orange haze. Hazy, and full looking. Fizzy champagne like white and slightly rosey head dissipating fairly quickly. Smells of white wine, champagney with distinct hibiscus right away followed by bitter sour citrus fruits. Tastes sour, tart, hibiscus right away and then the bitterness and sourness of the lemons comes later at the back of your throat. Carbonated perfectly and light tart mouthfeel like a good white wine. Lovely beer, just a tad above its counterpart the Brother Soigné in my opinion. Love it.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Sudz4Dayz"
3836,"2016-09-19",4.3,"Yields an orange-red color with a fizzy white head, not even leaving back a thin film of lacing.

Smells of strawberry bush, wild berries, hay and grass with a flowery lemon crispness on top. Got a dough wrapped old leather funk quality, accompanied by more hay and fresh cut wild flowers. 

Has a lively carbonation to it, showcasing a light bodied, utmost refreshing and versatile beer. It turns pleasantly fruity onwards from the mid palate, while its funky farmhouse character maintains on the palate, with a softer turning mouthfeel, once an initial effervescence slowly dies down.

Tastes of juicy blood orange pulp and a dryer layer of lemon zest with its fruitiness setting the tone during the beginning. Offers a well nuanced stony mineral quality, which enhances the sourness of the lemon, soothed by white bread dough. A flowery hay aspect joins in, complimenting to the sour, intriguing fruit profile. Finishes slightly dry, sour, maintaining its thirst quenching fruit quality, slowly maturing to a more soddled state, due to noticable malts.

Another unique offering from this world class brewery, convincing on all fronts. To me this is an innovative beer which looks great, smells great, has a well balanced, lively, yet soft mouthfeel - and the beer actually tastes great. Differently from what I expected it to be, fruitier, but with such a nice depth to it.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Floral, slightly earthy aroma with lots of juicy topical fruit notes, farmhouse funk, flower petal, pale malt and zesty spice. Tons of citrus, notably blood orange, mango, orange peel and lemon zest but the floral notes still stand out. Would never guess hibiscus but theres a very prominent floral character. Slightly musty and funky with hints of straw, farmhouse, grass, musty bugs and peppery spice. Theres some bready yeast and lemon pith in the nose as well. Really complex! 

Full bodied with soft carbonation and a decent balance of oak, wild funky bugs, citrus fruit, bread and pale malt. Incredibly complex with subtle pepper and coriander flavor followed by musty brett, wild yeast. Floral pale malt and sweet citrus toward the finish balance things really nicely. Slight creamy texture with some biscuit, flower petal and a ton of citrus swetness. Some lemon pith followed by strong notes of curaçao, blood orange and tangerine.

3836,"2015-08-03",4.2,"August 2014 magnum shared 7/25/15 by the generous Adam C.Lovely, bright deep pink-raspberry body is sparklingly-well-carbonated and is topped by an off-white, rose-flecked head that shows strong retention.Belgian yeast is soft and lightly fruity in the nose, full of light floral notes, a bit of damp moss and bits and pieces of tart acids. Citrus character breaks through, brightening things but malt keeps balance, all the while, in the background, adding light vanilla-tinged honey notes. Hibiscus isnt very prominent in the nose, perhaps adding just a touch of nutty-like dryness or earthy tea-like character. As with Hill Farmsteads saison/Belgian ales, its difficult to put my finger on exactly why I find their aromas so pleasing. Its nothing like any of the classics (Dupont, Blaugies, Thiriez, Fantome, etc...) yet nor is it even remotely like the new breed of pseudo or Americanized ""saisons"". Theyre all lovely, bright, airy and fresh yeast-filled aromas, yet they also carry just the right amount of earthy, cellar-like funkiness. Not that this is any problem, as none of the ""classics"" I just mentioned are all that much like each other. Sure, some are closer to each other than others, but all seem to say ""saison"" to me, without taking anything away from how the others express themselves as saisons. So, may as well chalk Hill Farmstead up as another dissimilar, yet equally ""classic"" example of the ""style"". A ""modern classic"", if you will.Ahem, back to the beer, the flavor is well-malted, tending a little sweeter than some of Shauns other offerings, but not problematic at all, for the hibiscus dryness and citrus acidity quickly kick in to help balance. Wonderfully tight, spritzy carbonation keeps things flowing and the finish holds wonderful acidity and brightness, with enjoyable hibiscus tartness, if youre in to that sort of thing (I am). Nothing fancy here, but Im always a huge fan of adjuncts when theyre done well (added conservatively, to be one aspect, not the whole character of the beer) and these are done admirably. Could honestly drink this all day. Like DdCs Rose des hibiscus, but with more complexity/Belgian character to it.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3836,"2015-07-13",3.7,"Bottle nearly a year old. Watermelon pink-red hue, slightly hazed, random lacing. Hibiscus, sweet and fragrant lemon oil, basement air and mildew in the aroma, with the latter notes sometimes leaning toward wet concrete or silty river water, clay-like mineral perfume. Likely has lost a measure of assertiveness. The colors are certain, if shown in pastel shades. The flavor offers preserved lemon, hibiscus, and an ebullient tangerine sweetness. Understated overall, and while simple, not simplistic. The texture has been worn somewhat, but the comfortable acid level combined with the just tight enough carbonation make this highly drinkable. This one is clearly age-weary in some respects, which is my own fault. The flavorings are nevertheless very evidently dialed in at pleasing frequencies, and the softness and mineral intrigue are present as ever.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

My first Hill Farmstead/Grassroots beer at home in quite a whilewell i actually shared this at Beer Study with some friendsbut it was my bottle, which I guess is what I meant. Appearance is fantastic as always, great head and lasting sticky lace. Nose is amazing. Great melding of light hibiscus, red fruits, light lemon/lime, funky HF yeast. Flavor followed suit. Truly one of the best saisons Ive had from HF and Ive had quite a few. This is a special beer which I assume was made to celebrate/say goodbye to Dan Suarez, one of the longtime assistant brewers in Greensboro. Cheers Dan! Cheers Shaun!

3836,"2014-02-05",4.4,"My Bottom Line:
Bountiful flowers and tart citrus are lifted by an aerial mouthfeel in this refreshing and oh-so-compelling Saison-like creation.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the orange-hued pinkish red.
-The mouthfeel is as tight as it is easygoing. This beer is in perfect shape right now.
-Effervescence is quite high, which works wonders with the fruity and floral flavor profile.
-Flavors are so intricate they are hard to identify individually. The chosen yeast, hibiscus and lemons are all in unison.<.

Nose is sharper white pepper, mild plastic, moldy orange rind, decent dose of diaper phenols, fresh lemon and flowers.

Poured an odd orangey color with loads of large bubbles vigorously rising and a huge fluffy white head. Aroma is very floral and funky, notes of old lemons, potpourri, flower petals. Delicate soft body with softer carbonation despite the visible rising effervescence and a quicker fading aftertaste. Flavor wasnt as potent as the aroma and seemed a bit to delicate for my tastes.

The sourness is less than expected but it is only in there to render the drink quenching.

Un nez délicatement floral et agréablement fruité.  Lhibiscus développe des effluves de petits fruits rouges qui se marient très bien aux parfums acidulés des citrons.  La levure apporte une petite touche campagnarde fraternelle avec lensemble des arômes.  Sur les papilles, le liquide est finement doux et savoureusement acidulé.  Les notes citronnées mordent la langue.  Les fleurs dhibiscus sont fruitées et sollicitent mes nerfs sensitifs.  Il y a quelques herbes et dautres fleurs dans cette concoction.  La levure me semble bien être celle qui se signale dans quelques offrandes de la maison.  En bouche, le liquide est bien touché par les bulles.

Lots of floral hibiscus and honey on the nose. I dont get much lemon. Citrus and lemon rind comes through very heavy on the taste though! with an earthy floral finish.

So, you know how Fantome makes a grip of beers under random labels, where it isnt always clear what the difference of one from another is? This is a good version of one of those.

Pours a glowing, hazed rust amber with a thick, fluffy off white head. Good retention, fades to a thin layer and clumps of lace. Aroma of the woodlands, tart and lemon, grassy, hibiscus petal, pine, peach, Starburst, and seriously, this smells like a Fantome. Flavor adds a little acidity to the mix and a stronger hibiscus presence, with lemon, peach, sweet yeast, mild acidity, grassy hops and deliciousness. Effervescent carbonation, full bodied, soft and crisp with a dry refreshing finish. Boom, great saison. Dont sleep on this under the Grassroots label.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","yourefragile"

Again from notes on 8/11/2013: 
Amber color, minimal head, decent lace.  Pears, Fuji apples, tame saison yeast, malted grain. 

Medium carb, reasonably viscous. Cidery, sweet overall profile initially before the yeasty bitterness imparts a dry finish.  Gave it a 3.5 the second time, will stick to my 3.6, though, as tasting conditions were better.  Solid.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"

3836,"2013-03-01",4.5,"750ml bottle into a tulip glass. Bottled January, 2013. Gushed over immediately after opening but luckily settles down after a quick pour.

A - The body is a dark amber with a faint shade of purple to it. Rather unique color which is only accented by the clarity. Plenty of soapy bone-white head which eventually settles down to a thin calm edge. Great lacing with a low level of retention.

S - Strong hibiscus flowers right off the bat. A bit of clean lemon peel and a great earthy funk. Some wheat and a certain sweetness lingers on the nose.

T - Floral elements lead way to lemons, house yeast and a bit of a sweet strawberry/honey mixture. Lightly tart but this finishes so dry and crisp that its never lasting or tiring. Lingering earthiness, faintly cheesey. 

M - Light, crisp, and delicate. Carbonation is low and prickly which combined with the flavor profile and moderate level of tartness makes for an absurdly drinkable saison. The clean finish is just perfect here.

O - This was inspired by a Fantome brew day...and it shows. The flavor and aroma is such a great combination of floral, sweet, tart, and earthy. This is just an excellent saison and the hibiscus seems better integrated than any other floral beers Ive tried. Very impressive.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"
