Nez légèrement floral, plutôt herbacé trahissant le style. On est bien en Europe de lEst, avec cependant une touche plus funky. En bouche le corps est moyen et les saveurs sont encore une fois herbacées mais davantage fruitées que ce qui métait suggéré au nez. Saveurs assez complexes pour une bière de ce type je dois dire. Lamertume est bien présente, les levures fraîches et pleinement savoureuses (qui nest pas toujours une bonne chose pour les bières de type Pilsner) et la base maltée est présente et offre un support agréable.

Also one has the impression that very nice water was used to brew this, something one also tastes in Czech beer. Sometimes one may not rate a beer like this as high as it should be rated because there is not the intense hop flavour like IPA or the various subtle flavours in an Imperial Stout but that is a mistake in my opinion. This may be a standard classic beer style as opposed to something unique tasting but it is a very well done version of this. This is the type of beer I could drink a lot of, almost like a session beer but a very high quality session beer. Unfortunately it is a bit too expensive to buy as a session beer.","Quebec, CANADA","UM02"

4545,"2008-08-28",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2009 In short: A sharp tasty pilsner with a heavier-than-usual malt backbone and spicier-than-usual hops
How: Tap at brewpub
The look: Clear dark golden body topped by an initially large off-white head with medium retention
In long: Lose of spicy noble hops on the nose.  Bigger-than-usual malt backbone for the style.  Soft honeyed dipped in smooth caramel and citrus juice poured all over it.  Nice maltiness here, certainly not crisp but not too heavy for the style.  Large amount of hops and somehow the natural spiciness of noble hops is multiplied by 10 and reaches peppery territory.  Theres more spicy dryness here than dry grassiness.  Finish is very sharp with a strong spicy bitterness.  This may not be a very refreshing Pils but it sure is a tasty one.  Good beer.  For a beer that hasnt been brewed for 2+ years Dieu Du Ciel sure nailed it right.  I guess brewing beer is one of those things you just dont forget once youve learned it like riding a bicycle or securing everything before pulling your fly up.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

4545,"2005-04-20",4.2,"On draught 4/16/05 at the brewpub with MartinT.  Served in a large pilsener glass, this beer appears bright yellow-gold, shining and clear.  You have to love natural filtration, as this one maintains a wonderful creamy mouthfeel and moderate carbonation, that is still natural and tingling.  The white head is initially large and slowly dissipates to a ring.  Good lacing on the glass is left behind.  The aroma is of sweet honey and vanilla flavored malt, with a tremendous fuzzy, green and fresh hops nose, neither too overpowering nor too subtle.  Flavor is lightly malty, moderately hoppy and the mouthfeel is smooth throughout, finishing crisp and lightly peppery.  Lemons and honey, fresh mineral water, light cream, pears and light apples with a perfect balance of hops.  I was surprised to learn that these can be made in a vertical ale fermentation tank, I had always thought they needed a horizontal lagering vessel.  But I guess the low alcohol does not require as much activity as say a Maibock or doppelbock.  Wonderful stuff.  If they only sold this by the 30 pack here in Mass, Id be all set with my beer needs for the summer.  A lovely, smooth pils without all of the cookies and heavy dough.

4545,"2004-05-01",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 27, 2008 Clear mid-straw, mid-golden yellow with a moderate sticky white head. Aroma contains a good saaz dose, but mostly a big malt profile, slightly caramelic and hay-ish at times. Taste is very herbal, floral saaz, crisp with moderate carbonation and a light-medium creamy body. The thing is.. after prima pils and a few magnificient sunny and warm spring days, Im really raging for a good pilsner and I dont find it, blessed be Victory. Back to the beer, I like a good floral hops character which elixir céleste has, but a bit too subdued to my liking. This and the malt, while perfectly toasty lacks a bit of the cookieness I adore and at times approach cerealic or almost grainy nuances. No defaults, diacetyl or off-flavours though, just a difficult to please taster. Still pretty good, but the kind of beer that gets killed from high expectations.After almost 3 years of absence, this is back and seemingly better than ever. Seriously, I know my tastes have evolved, but this just seemed like the best beer on the menu yesterday, with the likes of Péché Mortel and Chaman also being on the board. Remarkably fresh, vibrant pils malt character: bready, chewy yet crisp, fresh and clean cereals. Fresh cut grass and hay, floral hops. Full bodied, delicate yet tight carbonation. Plain delicious.

4545,"2003-07-30",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2017 Impressions from the bar stool:
-A veil of foam tops the clear dark gold.
-Considerable biscuity pils malts soften the spicy, herbal hoppiness. 
-The full malt body is more reminiscent of Svetly Specialnis here (14 degrees and up) than the usual Lezak (12-degree svetlé); Id like to know the original gravity of this one. 
-Orangey fruitiness stems from the union of honeyed cereals and lightly fruity hops. 
-The malts are even toasted at times, offering lots of flavor and a round body.
-There are 2 great Bohemian-style Pilseners in Montreal: this one and Amère à Boires Cerna Hora. Élixir Céleste is redolent of what some Czech microbreweries brew as their Specialni (Vyskovské General comes to mind), bigger-bodied, hoppier and not as crisp as the typical Lezak. Cerna Hora is more reminiscent of what rural brewpubs brew, that is unfiltered, unpasteurized, unadulterated goodness which might be variable at times, but which always offers a super-drinkable experience and lively flavors. Having both available at the same time in Montreal is nearly as satisfying as flying over the Bohemia for a weekend.
