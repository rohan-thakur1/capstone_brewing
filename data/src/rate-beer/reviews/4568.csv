4568,"2017-02-14",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed at a tasting at Steebos on February 11. 750 mL bottle, Blend #1. The pour is a slightly foggy golden straw color with a thick white head that falls down to a thin ring with haste. The aroma is really surprising. There is a definite wheat character to it, but its funky, citrusy, a little oaky, and carries a beautiful tartness about it. Its almost got a lemon zest level of tart. There is a decent white wine on the back end. The flavor is just as good. Its clean, crisp, and delicate with just the softest offerings of a spicy orange peel. The lemon zest, oak, and wine are really prominent and balance with each other to create some depth to this beer. The mouth feel is crisp and clean with a brighter carbonation and a lingeringly funky sour citrus finish. This is probably the best sour wit Ive ever had. Damn is this a treat.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

4568,"2017-02-09",3.7,"Draft to stemmed glass at SPC. Looks good; a very slightly hazy gold with white head that dissipates into lacing pretty quickly. Smells and tastes of a pleasant balance of wheat, oak, funk, orange, and chardonnay. Mouthfeel is medium-light to medium-bodied, moderately tart and effervescent, and pleasant. A very nice take on the style.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
4568,"2017-01-03",3.8,"Draft at Cellar. Hazy pale color. Aroma starts with a tart spiky, melony, citrus. Flavor is very citric, lively. Light bodied, light finish. Very fizzy mouthfeel and finish. Fun light tart beer.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

4568,"2016-12-28",3.8,"Draft at Cellar. Pour is hazy light yellow with a small, airy white head. Aroma and flavor softly acidic with light floral tones and a crisp clean finish. Light effervescent body. Easy to drink.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
4568,"2016-12-28",4.1,"Bottle, courtesy of the man, the myth, and the legend that is gregwilsonstl -- cheers! Straight away this tells you that its no trad witbier, with the funky smells of mixed fermentation and wine barrel aging jumping out of the bottle. Moderately high tartness, which works with the coriander and orange peel to give it a lemon/citrus character that is delicious. Reminiscent of some of Hill Farmsteads saisons, which is one of the highest compliments out there in my book. Light, sour, phenomenal, and way different from a Blue Moon.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
4568,"2016-12-22",3.8,"Bottle thanks to Seth. Pours a hazy white gold with small white head that lasts. The aroma is grape, funk, oak. Thin body, vinous, oak, funk, nice tartness, very good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
4568,"2016-12-17",4.1,"Another generous soul rate. 
Pours perfectly pale with a bit of haze and a respectable head. 

The aroma is lightly spicy with a beautiful earthy funkiness and some bright lemony citrus stuff going on.

The flavor is dry and just as tart and lemony as it could be. Lightly sour & lightly spicy with a great earthy character in the background.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
