Medium aroma of malts, wheat, orange, hops, citrus and spices.

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, wheat and orange; ends slightly bitter and dry with hops, citrus and spices.

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Thanks to the loads of orange peel and coriander, together with a bucket full of hops; this could truly be called a great Witbier.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

4592,"2015-03-20",3.2,"Tarwedubbel inspired by IPA, in fact a hybrid between the two, is claimed on the label. Hazy golden blonde under a moussy, lacing, fairly stable, egg-white head. Aroma is very Belgian (fruity esters), which in itself is far from a bad thing, but admittedly I had expected (a lot) more C-hops; I get impressions of mango, orange, lime juice and perhaps milk gone sour, some canned tomato, bell pepper, banana, tulips, mandarin liqueur, red apple peel, raspberries, raw rhubarb (acetaldehyde), freshly cut grass and, unfortunately, a faint touch of sewer water which - luckily - fades away completely after a while. Estery taste, a bit soapy, banana cream, apple, sour white grapes, candied orange, vanilla, medium and minerally carbo, smooth mouthfeel, sweetish with clear wheaty and yoghurty sourishness, bready malt backbone underneath, phenolic spiciness retronasally, drying finish more from persisting carbonation than anything else, yeasty and combining sweetness from the fruity esters with wheaty sourishness, with an emphasis on the first; hop bitterishness is there, but remains very limited and basic and not IPA-like in the least; in fact, the initial sweetness, though not cloying at all and remaining restrained, is the last impression. A lingering estery and soapy sweetishness dominates the finish. I had a few American white IPAs: this is nowhere close to it. This is another Belgian ale, not the worst in its kind at all, but nowhere near the (if any) standard Id expect from something which calls itself a white IPA. This is not a hybrid between witbier and IPA: this is a witbier with slightly above average ABV and slightly above average hop dosage, something which has been in existence for a few decades and should be labelled tarwedubbel, nothing more, nothing less.

Arôme offre un nez qui garde, malheureusement, ce côté très belge assez noble dans les houblons. Note de blé, pointe dépices; coriandre qui se retrouve assez dominante le tout complété par qcq pointes de houblons verts voire citronnés.
