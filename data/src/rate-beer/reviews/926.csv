926,"2016-11-12",3.3,"Keg at the brewpub, 7/13/16. Hazy orange, large foamy off-white head, good retention. Aroma of toasted malt. The taste is toasted malt and herbal hops. Thin bodied, high carbonation, crisp.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
926,"2014-05-27",2.3,"Like most of their beers, this one was pretty unremarkable. Light and slightly creamy with an okay head and weak body. Tried with Anne in VA in 2014.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","ads135"
926,"2010-11-25",3.4,"Courtesy of Cousin Jim from a growler. Pours hazy honey color with a small off-white head. Aroma is sweet caramely with a slight grassy bitterness. Flavor has a nice hoppiness to it. Mild and grainy but does have a slightly warming alcohol. Pretty rich body with a definite bitterness.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Naka"
926,"2010-03-07",3.0,"Backlogged rating from Christmas. Dark orange pour with an off white head. Some light toasted malt. Crystal sugar candy flavor and a bit of caramel. A light english hop bitter finish. A little thin and otherwise unassuming.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
926,"2009-02-23",3.8,"Draft at the tavern.  STLCL pours a nice copper color with a smallish head.  The aroma has a solid lager base that is neither metallic nor full of mineral smells.  There is a light fruit sweetness as well.  The extremely cold beer has a surprising amount of hops and skirts on the idea of an IPL (India Pale Lager :)  The body is medium-to-heavy and a little gritty.  The finish has a nice peppery quality.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MrRain"
926,"2007-05-04",2.8,"A middle of the road lager.  Kinda dull really.  It reminded me a little too much of your standard cheap lager to be intresing.  I liked the noise and color but the flavor was a little too textbook.","Austin, Texas, USA","blank"
926,"2007-05-03",3.9,"Draft at Merrifield location. Light hazy coper color, thick white head.  Caramels, malts in the aroma.  Flavor is slightly citrus, with some fruit and malts.  A pretty good lager type of beer, and coming from me that is pretty suprising (lagers make up most of my worst scores).","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
926,"2004-01-23",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2008 Murky, mahogany-colored lager with a beautiful, creamy, white head. Good retention and excellent lacework.
Nose is of citrus fruit, fuzzy fruit and white wine.
The flavor is lacking as the beer is a bit too cold. However, its perfectly balanced and full-bodied with a dry mouthfeel. Fizzy carbonation. Short, crisp, clean finish. Leaves the mouth feeling parched. Im not a big lager guy, but I really like this beer.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
926,"2004-01-08",4.0,"Hazy copper.  Nose caramel, nalty, bit sweet.  Caramel, sweet, very malty.  Nice stickiness, light but chewy.  Very good.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
926,"2003-11-14",3.7,"Hazy dark amber color. Head is small and off-white. Aroma is fruity with a firm malt behind it. The flavor is dry malt and some ale like fruitiness. Body is medium. Overall a pretty nice beer in a style that is hard to come by,  unless of course the bottle says Steam© on it.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
926,"2002-09-02",4.1,"Unique malt scent with a copper hue.  Sweet bitterness.  Lager-like aftertastes.  Respectable!","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
