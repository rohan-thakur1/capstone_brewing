Coriander and other spices, something tangy in there. Especially in the finish; resembles lemon that is not too bitter; kinda like those containers at the grocery that resemble a lemon. 

What hoppiness I get compliments the spices rather than detracts. Another thing that I notice is a perceived by me hint of a honey presence.

What the heck is that? Nothing like other wits Ive had - not creamy, not white (at least not with a careful pour, trying to avoid the characteristic Logsdon gusher - but the last inch turned it white), lots of tart.

4574,"2014-07-30",4.5,"Thought this was a saison initially so I poured it into a tulip. 
Only after I poured most of it unto this glass I found out its a witbier. Drat! Next time, proper glassware. 
From this session, here are my findings. 
The appearance was a nice looking hazy golden yellow to orange color with a thin half finger-ed white foamy head that concaves rather nicely leaving a nice clingy foaminess all around. 
The smell was absolutely amazing with a nice lemon to orange fruitiness really sweet and strong with such a nice spicy coriander and clove - like allocation in the blend. 
The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and combined them rather nicely. 
On the palate, this one sat right at a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation finishes fairly smooth with a nice creaminess coating my tongue. The carbonation is there but not too much. 
Overall, hot damn, I was skeptical of the price but being my first one by Logsdon, I had to jump. Oh yeah, bottle number is 16985, best if enjoyed by 12/2014. This was so worth the $15. I can only imagine how it would be if I would have put it in proper glassware.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

4574,"2013-11-28",3.8,"In short: A citric witbier of superior quality with a nice farmhouse character.
How: Bottle 750ml, consumed relatively fresh not long after purchase.
The look: Cloudy pale yellow body topped by a medium white head with medium retention.
In long: Nose is pleasantly musky and somewhat farmhouse over banana esters. Taste offers a lot of wheat that actually taste like sundried straw. There is also fresh bananas, a bite in a fluffy lemony pastry, a slice of lime, green herds, citric hops, mild spiciness. For a beer that says it is brewed using coriander on the label, it sure didnt feel very corianderized. Lively carbonation and the strong yeast presence increased the foamy mouthfeel. This is no your girly witbier. This is along the lines of a St. Bernardus Blanche as a top example of this usually boring style. I;m really digging this brewery.

Pours a straw golden hue, cereal yellow, slight haziness, but near transparent. Light and yellow, a cakey bright white head atop dies to a firm filmy layer, sticks around and laces well. Vibrant carbonation. Aromas show banana and fruity ester, gentle Belgian yeast grows, a touch spicy with straw, bread, and gentle coriander. Touches of oat, bread, a dry earthy hop element comes on as it warms and settles. Banana, apple, gentle lemon peel. Initial is a decent tartness up front, lemony and gentle tartness mix with bready malts, fairly clean and light cereal element, dry straw and gentle yeastiness. A firm fruity presence. Middle is still tart, firm tart apple, bit of banana and lemon elements still intertwine. Some gentle funk and fuzzy dryness as we round the corner, decent straw, grass, and mellow spiciness mix with a young but definitely present bretty house feel. Finish is light, effervescent, and dry.

Pours a pale, hazy gold topped with an enormous mound of fine white bubbles. Pretty much spot on for the style. Clumps of bubbles cling to the walls of the glass.

It mostly smells of clean, doughy wheat. I think theres some spicing, coriander and orange or lemon peel, in the mix, but its pretty far in the background. Lightly grassy hops. Theres a hint of funk and cleanly earthy yeast. A touch of band-aid. Its just an awfully light aroma. Very clean and subtle for the style.

The taste is similarly clean. Its mildly dry. Theres still a fresh, sweet wheat flavor, but it sits lightly on the palate and doesnt linger. Some earthy funk from the yeast, particularly in the finish. More citrus and coriander. Apples, apricots, green grapes. Tasty.

Light, pleasant mouthfeel. I enjoy the even drier wits, like Anchorage Whiteout, but this is just a very nice beer to drink. It goes down smoothly. Carbonation is fine, plentiful and gentle. 

This is a nice witbier. Its well made and drinkable. Judging by other reviews, it seems that the spicing isnt quite dialed in. I like this milder version, though. It comes off rather saison-like, which as someone who prefers saisons to wits, I dont mind. Anywho, its a good beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

The taste is initially the wheat grain, turning to the spice of the coriander and lemongrass, and finishing with the pronounced musty, hint of funk, yeast.  Quite full flavored, perhaps a bit heavy on coriander and lemongrass for my tastes. The palate is light to medium bodied, soft carbonation, and a lingering yeasty after taste.

4574,"2012-10-17",3.6,"A soft pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a four-finger thick, rim topping, pale tan colored head that leaves lots of thick lacing on the sides of my glass. The beer is a nice gold color, with lots of streaming carbonation, that shows a brilliantly clear, pretty yellow-gold hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells of clean bright, tropical citrus that is backed by a musty, slightly white pepper like character, and a touch of pale grain character.

Effervescent, dry, but with some sweetness, as well as a clean citrus character, some bitter herbal notes, and a hint of tartness. The bitterness is actually fairly pronounced for a Wit beer. Lots of woody, herbal notes, a touch of pine, spruce tip like flavors, a touch of Meyer Lemon, and a dry tropical fruit like note are quite noticeable here. The body has a fullness to it that seems to be contributed by the wheat, but this is quite light and quaffable. The finish has a touch of musty spiciness to it as well as a carbonic bite, and musty grain character. The grain character here has a tart wheat flavor to it, a wholesome straw like note, even some green grassiness, and perhaps a hint of soda cracker to it. The second pour with some yeast in it accentuates a raw wheat dough character as well as softening and muting the citrus / fruit character here, as well as the bitter bite. The peppery spice character gets nasal with a musty, spicy note that makes my nose itch as the bee warms up.

Definitely a nice Wit; I am quite impressed that the citrus character was mostly achieved by the hop character, I assume there is some grains of paradise used here that contributes to the citrus character as well as the soft, musty, woody character, and definitely a soft spiciness in the finish.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4574,"2012-07-10",4.0,"750mL bottle, Bottle No. KW 3345, Best enjoyed by 01/2013 from Olive Tree Market in OB for $10.99, Or OB Quik Stop for $16.99. Really? Only 9 ratings so far? Ive seen this, unmoving on the shelves for at least a few months.  Maybe their price point is a little high for a pretty much unknown brewery.  Hazy pale straw with a 1 1/2 finger white head, fades to a lasting thick film for the duration, and easily roused to a larger, more pretty head.  Aroma has the same yeasty earthy rustic-ness as their Seizoen, with a bit stronger wheat notes and pear.  There is also some definite coriander.  Flavor continues with the earthy, almost manure-ish rustic nature of what seems to be par for Logsdon beers.  Whereas most wits tend to have a much brighter quality to them, this aforementioned characteristic keeps it from becoming so.  By no means is this necessarily bad, but it does take some getting used to. Luckily for me, it just took most of the bottle of Seizoen.  Theres a little bit of hay as well, and maybe I get a little bit of oats once it warms up, as well as very light floral notes.  Semi-dry finish with bitterness peaking at a 2, and had some lingering wheat.  I liked that the coriander was more a complementing ingredient, as opposed to a perfumey citrus bomb, as is the case so often. Moderate to high carbonation with a medium body.  A rustic witbier, probably more authentic than most Ive had, especially in the US. I need to stop by this place if Im ever in Oregon.
