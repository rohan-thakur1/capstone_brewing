Like the base beer, whiskey barrel Old Chub has a burgundy brown color, although there is barely any off-white cap  resting on top of the beer.

The whiskey and oak take control of the aroma, which is a nice improvement.  Brown sugar, dark fruits, and peat round out the aroma.

Balance is really the word to describe the flavor.  Each flavor really integrates well with the others, creating a smooth and enjoyable sip from start to finish.  The whiskey works its way into the strong malt presence, cutting the sweetness and adding some needed depth.  Vanilla, oak, and some spices combine with the caramel malt, toffee, and peat notes to create a complex middle, and the barrel is the last nip of the flavor left in my mouth.  Quite well done.

This is about as thick and creamy as the base beer, with the same gentle, smooth carbonation.  Due to the barrel it is more dry than the base beer.  There is just a little bit of alcohol burn that feels like it is mostly coming from the barrel.

It is tough for a Scotch Ale to impress me, but whiskey barrel old chub is definitely something I would order again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

677,"2009-01-29",3.6,"Draught.  At Coles Rare Beer Fest, January 2009.  Clear deep ruby pour with a small off-white head.  Very sweet aroma (Scotch ale and bourbon, who could guess that?) - sweet vanilla, caramel, alcohol, just a hint of floral bitterness, maybe a slight mineral tang as well.  The taste, while certainly very sweet, was well-balanced - bourbon and medium-roast malt really work well, and I also got a bit of that ""Burton zing"" - definitely some iron in there, a bit like a wee heavy - and most interesting of all, I got very strong tangerine acidity in the finish.  Light-bodied, sticky, softly carbonated - perhaps a bit quick-finishing, but simple, tasty and good - Id have this again, but then I like the Gordon a lot already.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

Poured a deep, deep brownish black with a big off-white head that hung around throughout leaving big intricate lacing along the way.

Smell is caramel malts and dark fruits, especially raisins, along with a very controlled bourbon aroma that was not overpowering at all.

Much like the smell, the taste is big on dark fruits and caramel malts up front with a definite bourbon presence that lingers in the finish after every sip.

Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied and very creamy.  The bourbon is definitely a major player in this brew.

677,"2006-09-29",2.7,"Draught tulipy-thing at Hop Devil on 9/22/06.Deep, mahogany-auburn (more mahogany) body shows medium clarity, with a fairly large off-white head that is pretty well-retained but quickly recedes to cover.  Light lacing as well.Very loud bourbon notes in the nose.  Juicy, succulent and thoroughly overdone!  But its not terribly dry and tannic, and allows some room for a touch of caramel and light melanoidins.  Vanilla cream sweetness grows in the middle and perhaps some chocolate and light char.  Pretty much a heavy bourbon ride without alot of the harshness and alcohol.  So in that respect its quite nice, except that theres little to be had as far as beer....Wood and crystal malt hardness produce an almost souring effect on the palate, that is somewhat relieved by a bit of caramel/chocolate sweetness but then thoroughly bludgeoned by huge bourbon notes.  Some definite booziness with warming in concert with emerging wooden dryness fatigues the palate quickly.  Lively enough carbonatoin, being on draught, keeps the mouthfeel reasonable, but the mouthfeel cant save the bourbon dominance.  Little touch of wateriness on the end.  Didnt finish the glass.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Aorma is nice bourbony notes with more wood and hints of vanilla, and sharp caramel malts.  Caramel in the flavor is subdued by the wood and bourbon, more alcohol hints arise, bourbon, oaky, and finishes very very dry.
