320,"2017-05-21",4.5,"Po przelaniu buduje się obfita, drobna i dość trwała piana, sam trunek ma barwę ciemnego mahoniu, prawie czarną, nieprzejrzystą. W zapachu niezwykle przyjemny miks toffi, kakao i wanilii. W smaku nieco powyżej półsłodkiego, intensywne toffi, karmel, krówki, czekolada, kawa espresso i wanilia, delikatna cierpkość i szorstkość od beczki, całość wykończona muśnięciem whisky i średnią, tytoniową goryczką. Dość mocno rozgrzewające, z nisko średnim nagazowaniem, pełne, średnio gęste i delikatnie wyklejające w odbiorze.

Bardzo szlachetny, wykwintny trunek, zdecydowanie deserowy, aczkolwiek nie jest to #teamslodyczka. Mimo wszystko wanilia sprawia, że sączy się to jak jakieś płynne ciasto, co nie było cechą podstawy.","Kalisz, POLAND","alteregoo"

Aroma blossoms with heavy toffee and caramel and oak shored up by a massive bourbon backbone. Taste starts with a burst of caramel and molasses, sweet as soft candy and almost as chewy, then grows a dark fruit middle, black cherry and fig and raisin, before the a licorice-tinted finish offers up massive waves of bourbon and oak. So much oak. Might be one of the biggest oak bombs Ive tried, with a lengthy bitter, dry fade more woody and liquor-fueled than a frat boy. Alcohol remains bearable despite the ABV. Never thought it was possible to have too much oak, but this beer pushes my limit. Still, pretty damn enjoyable.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

The cork comes free with a practiced wrist and a coaxing tug, releasing the aroma immediately and allowing my watering mouth a suggestive tease. I tip the glass and pour slowly, watching the thick, black-walnut flow broach the rising head; a foam the color of dark mocha, deep, wet and soft. The thick cap vanishes into a swirling galaxy on the surface in a matter of minutes.
The aroma is chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, becoming more heady and aromatic over the course of the review. I tip the glass and pull the brew slowly through my mouth, feeling the cool liquid find its way beneath the soft undersides of my tongue, stinging it just a touch. Dark, bourbon-soaked, over-ripe fruits come alive in the flavor and accent the dark chocolate perfectly, the vanilla still very apparent in the aroma and adding a mellow groove to the experience. The heavy body is a bit oily, not sticking to my tongue, but glancing over it, the carbonation is soft and the finish only long enough to make me think I should have bought another bottle.","USA","lightbias"

A - Pours jet black with a small half finger tall java colored head, dissipating down to a thin film, leaving spotty sheets of lacing down the glass.


S - Quite a bit of bourbon up front mixes with some sweet chocolate, vanilla, oak/wood, dark roasted malt, and a bit of booze. Pretty well balanced even with all those flavors competing for the lead.


T - Plenty of chocolaty sweetness up front giving way quickly to a mix of bourbon heat, vanilla, and dark roasted malts. Finish is a bit hot with plenty of lingering sweet roast. Nice balance of base flavors and the woody bourbon from the barrel. Very good stuff.


M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Sweet, roasty, heat both in the feel and the finish.


D - Pretty high all things considered. I have always liked this beer. The combo of dark stout and bourbon is really nice. The only drawback is the high ABV. as it really does prevent you from enjoying multiple servings.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

A: Pull the cage off the cork and give the cork a firm twist and tug, the bitch barely moves. Finally work it off to an underwhelming ""oop"" of cork expanding out the mouth of the bottle. Pours out a dark, dark maduro ale with a sheet of transient cocoa foam. The foam disappears in a few seconds to leave a rim of the same bordering a mirrored surface over this darky. No lace. 

S: Oak, licorice, black cherry, molasses and dark malts. Some sweet bourbon notes. Kinda has a cake smell on it.

T: Hot as hell. The alcohol is the first thing I notice. Then toasted cocoa and coffee alongside some vanilla notes and just a whiff of coconut. Some nice bourbon tones. Really, really potent. 

M: Thick and viscous (fancy that), carbonated (fancy that!!), an oddly sticky yet dry finish. 

O: So heres the thing, I can drink this, and would say its a decent beer. I would argue it is overpriced compared to similar beers. The barrels really come through stronger than I prefer, but they are exactly that - barrels previously having held alcohol. Would I drink again? Absolutely. Will I purchase another bottle? If I find one at the same price ($17/375ml) that is at least two years old then I will. Otherwise, this one can sit on the shelves.

Appearance: Pitch black, no head, no lacing.

Smell: Bourbon sweetness, vanilla, molasses.

Taste: Thick, sticky. Bourbon but not nearly as sweet as BCBS and not even close to KBS. Lots of bourbon, maybe too much. If its this boozy with a year on it, I can only imagine how boozy it is fresh.

Finish: Some dark chocolate. Malt. Woodiness. A bit of burn. More sweetness as it warms, but more burn as well.

Overall: Not as complex as other barrel-aged brews. I feel like I should have drank an Old Viscosity first to see how the barrel aging adds or covers elements of the base beer. Ive come to feel that barrel aging needs to enhance or add to the complexities of a beer otherwise it just ends up being overly boozy, like someone splashed bourbon in a stout for no good reason.","","Lognar"

Appearance: The body appears black through the center, but its actually a very deep mahogany thats rather clear, only a very thin short lived tan head.

Taste: The flavor is very mellow on the intro only hinting at cocoa and coffee, the flavor quickly picks up and tastes of diluted bourbon and heavy oak with an underlying cocoa and coffee that are very subdued and noticed most in the lingering flavor and slight coating on the tongue.

Taste is big rich mellow and well blended.  Loads of rich malts, chocolates, vanillas, other rich bourbon notes, a dry oak finish on the tongue.  Some light milk chocolate in their as well.  Delicious!","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"

Rich vanilla and wood ethers dominate the pallet. Rich dark fruits mix in as well with very small hints of chocolate and coffee. Taste is sweet. Extremely sweet. You can tell they hopped it though because the bitterness comes through on finish. Mostly sweet though. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy.

Sometimes we have to make choices in life. Temptations. Decisions. Or just plain going with gut feelings. And I figure I am alive, well, and for the most part happy, so I guess my batting average is okay, but Ive oft made the wrong decisions. The ability to drink this beer was a product of some decision that in hindsight, I am not be proud of. I am not talking anything illegal here. Just, err, unethical. Or perhaps bad karma. Not guilt, maybe regret.The funny thing about regret...it is better to regret something you have done, than something you havent done....

Which leads me to Older Viscosity. The pour was most memorable for me. Thick. Real thick, motor oil blackness with the thinnest brown head. The smell was all booze. But a real nice bourbony booze.

Lovely balance of barrel notes of vanilla, whiskey, tannic oak; stout notes of some roasty bitterness, a touch of espresso, and nice stiff malt.","California, USA","beermanusa"

Nose is bourbon from the second it is uncorked, with a few other malty flavors on the backside like chocolate, but mainly bourbon. Taste is much more round, the bourbon is almost not present. There are a good number of other contributors  to flavor, mainly a strong vanilla like note, more likely from the oak barrel.","New Jersey, USA","msojka"

As thick as expected with great fully burnt to a crisp malt taste.  The barrel stays in the back and adds to the wonderful flavors...maybe there is just so much flavor in the malt that it can compete.  The malt has a very unique flavor, who knows what step/ingredient it came from, but it is awesome.  This sticks and coats to your mouth but the malt flavor is so good, that gets it a perfect score for palate.  Impressive stuff.","USA","Nik925"

A light at the end of the tunnel.  This beer was frigging fantastic.  Could of it been better with carbonation?  Hell yes.  This beer could of been amazing.  But you see the smell and taste this beer gives off still knocked my socks off.  As soon as you pour this beer you are blasted by the aroma. Bourbon, oak, chocolate, roasted malt, and vanilla just attack the nose.  Its huge and I just wanted to sit there and take it all in.  As you drink this beer you feel a warm sensation throughout.  The taste is big just like the smell.  It took me a good 1 1/2 hours to finish my glass.  Its a sipper.  Straight up boozy,  Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, molasses, and dark fruits.  Amazing.

320,"2012-01-23",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 14, 2012 Bottle (375ml) vintage 09 (the amazing one) @ Brasserie 4:20. Motor oil (not a big ""viscosity"" i dare say) black color with brown reflexes, no head at all. strong aroma of Bourbon, booze, oak, dark fruits, figs, A LOT of vanilla. Taste of bourbon, booze, wood, wet oak, bitter chocolate, and again, MUCH MUCH vanilla. Boozy, vanilla, bitter chocolate finish. The body is not thick as you could expect, the mouth feel is medium and the texture is quite liquid and flat. Not a complex beer, but very very strong, straight and intense. Honestly i had hard times trying to finish it, it warms a lot. The bourbon side prevails above all and the too much vanilla results cloying. maybe the too intense barrel aging (and the years) took too much beer away. Its funny that it absolutely taste similar to a barrique red wine like the taurasi. To summarize: Is it worth the cost? no,it isnt. Should i suggest you to drink it? Yes, absolutely, a great intense experience. share it with 2 or 3 other beer geek (this stuff is their territory) and all will be ok.

320,"2011-12-19",3.4,"2008 bottle given by cquiroga 2 years and a half ago. Thanks. This is one pleasantly complex massive brew and that complexity is fortunate as its also extremely sweet. Screaming cocoa/vanilla fumes as soon as the bottle is opened, it would feel as much like pina colada than bourbon were it not for the generous alcohol splash and smokey earthiness. Chocolate dessert like rich palate sprayed by sparse carbonation. The alcohol grows tougher as it warms up, the strong bitterness from a younger and unaged Old Viscosity becoming something to long for more and more. Impressive how the 3 years of age and barrel-aging have not thinned out the huge body some more. Also impressive is the large tan head that remains a crowning achievement throughout the tasting. Not the type of beer I love these days, but a fun sipper nonetheless, albeit not subtle.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Lots of malty, chocolatey, toffee-ey aromas along with wood, some soy, molasses, milk, leather, leaves, spiced raisin bread, almond, light char, light citrus. The bourbon is not insane and in your face like a lot of other bourbon beers where it seems like they are just pouring bourbon into the beer.  When I poured it, there was no head at all, but if I swirl it, I get a nice dense creamy brown head that fades back to a small ring and island in not much time. The taste is incredible. I cant believe the bourbon is so mellow and not overpowering, yet, along with the malty richness, it is the main focus. The texture is incredibly soft and smooth with just a little bite of alcohol. The carbonation is low but still enough to really drive some flavor into the tongue. Amidst all of the bourbon and silky sweet malt, there is just enough hop character to add the delicate balance that is needed. This is the best bourbon beer Ive ever had. I was really expecting something just over the top insane, but this is smooth, delicate and delicious. And this is this years vintage.

The smell has a lot of bourbon and alot of raisin. Alcohol prickles the nose. There is some vanilla and oak in there as well. Very much barrel-dominated, almost no stout notes.

The mouthfeel is thinner than I would have expected and I think it works. The flavor is again barrel dominated. Lots of dark fruit, caramel, and sweetness. Just a hint of cocoa. Reminds me of Darkness with a giant addition of bourbon. It is pretty smooth despite the abv, that could be because of aging.

Flavor starts off with a very smooth light roasted malt bitterness combined with a light chocolate presence. This transitions to a  mildly sweet prune middle with the start of the bourbon flavor. A strong bourbon and woody flavor comes in late in the tasting and fades away for a while after the sip. The body perfectly compliments the beers flavors, allowing for enough density to make the flavors pop. Carbonation is very fine and adds a slight sharpness to the finish of the beer.

Aroma is bourbon, roast, chocolate truffle, vanilla, burnt sugar, a touch of leather tanning, old leaves and dusty dry straw.

Palate is heavy bodied, lightly carbonated and creamy right up until the slightly drying, boozy finish. The palate suits the beer nicely, even the fairly strong alcohol burn fits.

Funny label depicting a guy under an old truck, emptying used motor oil into pint glasses. And thats what this looks like, completely impervious motor-oil black. Has no head but leaves a ring of dark tan foam. Smells like a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. The oak and bourbon are quite pungent; also chocolate milk and some overripe fruit. This is without a doubt the most thick and syrupy beer Ive ever had. Holy freaking firkins, Batman. Taste is mostly sweet with a sour backbone. Tastes like a really rich, alcoholic and decadent liquid dessert. Its like drinking alcohol-laced Hersheys syrup straight from the can, only that sounds pretty nasty. This is delicious.

320,"2011-06-15",4.3,"12.7oz bottle, 2011 release.  Served at cellar temperature.
Pours dark brown to blackwith a one finger brown head that recedes to a wispy cap and ring, leaving only a few spots of lacing behind.  Also not as thick as I had thought it would be.

Aroma is an absolutely wonderful wave of bourbon, one of the better bourbon noses Ive encountered.  Also tagging along are notes of oak, rich chocolate, premium coffee, vanilla, anise, figs, plums, black currants and other dark fruits.  Excellent strength.

Flavor is again more tasty bourbon, well pronounced but doesnt overpower the chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, oak, vanilla, and a strong dark fruit component.  There is noticeable alcohol on the finish but within tolerance for a big bourbon barrel aged beer.  Very complex.

Mouthfeel is medium to high, creamy with low/medium carbonation.

Freaking fantastic.  One of the more bourbon-heavy beers Ive had but still integrates very well and doesnt completely take over the base beer.  Incredible aroma, one of those beers where Ill keep the last ounce in the glass for as long as I can so I can keep taking it in.

320,"2011-03-07",2.0,"Poured into a snifter. Thanks to nickd717 for this a long time ago. 2009 vintage (yeah, that one).

We all know the legend of Flat Abbey and now its my turn to participate in its uncarbonated history.

I thought I knew right away that this too would be uncarbonated, even after the two year incubation in the cellar, but...

2.0 A: ...a touch of carbonation had presented itself. But dont worry, your bottle isnt going to be the way it should be. By a touch I mean that even with a semi-aggressive pour, I managed only about 1/16 inch of head that was quickly pulled back into the black colored abyss. Also of note, a chunk of some sort of sludge fell into the glass about 3/4 into the pour. Images of Triple Bock plopped into my head as the sludge cake plopped into the glass.

4.5 S: I must say that Im thoroughly impressed. This smells great and has plenty of power even without the aid of the carbonation to traffic aroma molecules to the surface. Bourbon is by far the strongest aroma. Leather, melon, vanilla, oak are all there in pleasant proportions. Theres just a touch of underlying roastiness and some sweet caramel to enhance. I usually dont appreciate bourbon forward smells, but this is in perfect proportion and is hard not to enjoy.

2.0 T: For the taste, Im not thoroughly impressed and indeed not impressed at all. The lack of carbonation took what would have been an okay beer and turned it into overly sugary and boozy watered down dram of bourbon. The bourbon blocks out everything except for the caramel sweetness and the priming sugar. This is just too damn sweet (but not cloying) and the only thing balancing it is astringent bourbon booziness. Lots of leather and vanilla with just a hint of the beer underneath. I like bourbon barreled beers, but prefer the bourbon to complement rather than dominate.

1.5 M: Heavier medium body. By this point I shouldnt have to tell anyone what the carbonation is like. Its not exactly zero carbonation, but its 98% reduced from what I would want. Not particularly smooth due to the bourbon overload either.

2.0 D: Damn good nose that almost made the bottle a good experience by itself. However, nothing else is up to par. The lack of carbonation made a shitty appearance, a shitty mouthfeel, and a shitty taste. I had hoped that the time in the cellar would have improved this aspect, but alas it did not. I damn near love Old Viscosity, but it was hard to find any of it in the nose or the taste. The bourbon was too powerful to allow that to occur. Tomme should be ashamed of himself for releasing this to the public, especially given the gaudy price. I should also note that I absolutely loved Triple Bock. It was so unthinkably complex and the flavors meshed well together. This doesnt have that same kind of complexity or quality to warrant a good score in spite of being flat.

6- A tough battle between the vanilla aroma, and the heavy sticky sugariness that emanates from the top of the surface. I think I know how this is going to taste.
4- Well, you cant fault that nice dark copper hue, but it was as flat as a pancake, and so glassy you can call that a pancake with syrup on.
6 Vanilla/bourbon-dominated flavours make this a uni-directional sipper. If you dont like the vanilla or you dont like raw sugar, youre not going to like this. I can put up with it when its clearly a sipper.
4- With all the sugars, its soft and smooth, but yes, clearly slick and sticky too. Clearly very strong, but the sugar/alcohol combination prevents it from actually burning, its actually not a bad liqueur. Finish does have some coffee notes, so definitely would work well as an after-dinner liqueur.
12 Of course, this is basically instant diabetes in a glass, but in the right context, its quite drinkable.

S: Loads of coffee and espresso with heap after heap of bourbon as well. Some mild, dry sweetness coming alongside some bittersweet chocolate.

T: Some alcohol comes alongside the espresso, which ends up really bringing out the bourbon characteristics. Any chocolate and/or sweetness is quite subdued.

Not as rich or complex as I crave for this style, but Ii want to send a stinging rebuttal to those who say this is either overrated or undercarbonated.  It is perhaps a bit of both, but it hs a presence about it that reminds me of Lando Calrissian.

This one pours all but flat. There is only the smallest hint of carbonation here. Dark black opaque as promised by the name. The nose is all about the bourbon and oak from the barrels. First trip past the lips there is a slight alcohol warmth. -- Doh! 12% - lets go slow - and then the bourbon and sweet, caramel, oak flavors. I absolutely love this beer. Maybe its the autumn in the air, but this is hitting the spot dead on tonight. Oak and bourbon dominate with cherry, chocolate, caramel following closely and threatening to take over.

Aroma is lovely with a big bourbon presence and other notes of wood, booze, dark chocolate, vanilla liqueur.  Flavor is also nicely complex with (again) big bourbon flavors, molasses, wood, chewy caramel, chocolate.  Its boozy -- the hotness distracts a little bit.  The barrel character and higher ABV makes this quite different from the normal Old Vis, and somewhat similar to the Angels Share series (though not quite as good).

320,"2010-08-27",3.1,"Whoa! This is a bourbon aged monster. It looks like an imperial stout--thick black, small tan head, little patches of lace. The nose is interesting, very pungent though, in all honestly, not necessarily completely good. It smells of chocolate, Cabernet, coconut and bread dough. There is also another facet I can only describe as meaty, just sort of a savory richness, which really is as strange as it sounds. I like it overall but it is a strange mix that doesnt completely work. The velvety texture compliments the overall chocolate taste quite well but when you get right down to it, this is just a bit much. Complexity is often overrated and that, I think is the case here. Still, despite its shortcomings, it is an intense experience and one that is sure to interest lovers of barrel aged beers, which is why I feel it merits a north of average score despite all my negative comments.

A - Dark black with dark brown hues on the edges. Thick, oily appearance. Tiny, almost non-existent, foamy, tan head that disappears fast. Thin ring of lace around the edge of the glass.

S - A lot of dark molasses and burnt brown sugar. This is paired with a lot of bourbon and vanilla along with an oaky/woody aroma. Also has a fair amount of dark chocolate and fudge aroma, and just a faint hint of coffee. Really pretty complex, with molasses, bourbon, and chocolate aromas intermingling.

T  Similar to the aroma. Strong chocolaty fudge and roasted dark malt to start with hints of coffee. Then a good kick of bourbon, vanilla, and oak comes out. This works well with the chocolate, fudge taste. Some burnt sugar, brown sugar type of sweetness comes out toward the middle of the sip. This is quickly cut by the bourbon, boozy taste that lingers after the sip.

M - Medium to full body. Thick, although not quite as viscous as I expected, and chewy. On the lower side of carbonation, but it works alright with the beer.

D - Definitely has a boozy aspect and alcohol is present, but it is still pretty drinkable as those flavors dont go unchecked. Body isnt quite what I expected but still full and filling.

Flavor is clearly better with rounded, rich vanilla, strong and thick maltiness, but not cloying. Alcohol is warming smoothly. Full body, slicky, warming, low in CO2.

320,"2010-07-22",2.6,"Ive been looking forward to popping the cork on this beer with such expectation.  That its £15.99 a bottle and such a highly rated beer on Ratebeer are only two reasons; the other is the much talked about carbonation issue which affected most of the special Port Brewing/ Lost Abbey 2009 editions.  The questions is, fizzy or flat.  Well, thats simply answered: undeniable flat.  It pours jet-black with no head, a dead beer.  And I will not accept that this is the brewers intention, as that has to rate along with ""The dog ate my homework"" in terms of excuses.  Its flat and thats a blunder of the beermakers - no excuses.  But with that said,  the nose is quite something; intense vanilla and overpowering wood.  Then big smoky notes.  Theres a nuttiness and a woozy alcohol presence, which only means that the 12% ABV is all too apparent.  The nose is of dust and ash and a heady alcohol... which is a bit of a let down for a beer rated this highly.  As it is, Old Viscosity scores higher for me and even that was a let down.  This is over priced and under-carbonated.  I once drank a bottle of Old Chimneys Good King Henry Special Reserve (with a group of dear friends), and that was incredible - it was everything this beer isnt.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","theSlipperyPen"

320,"2010-07-10",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2012 A: After several months of praying to the gods of all things carbonated, the 2009 Older Viz was finally cracked open. Much to my delight there was an audibly recognizable release of gas when the cork was popped. Dark brown/black body with a faint, timid khaki cap. Forms a tight ring with some skim in the middle. Very, very, very spotty lacing.

S: Rich bourbon, oak and vanilla highlight a rich, slightly bitter chocolate and roasty malt base. Inviting and strong, yet not ""i might as well bang my head against the wall because I sense a hangover coming"" strong.

T: More bourbon, oak and vanilla atop a thick, creamy semi-sweet chocolate. Good amounts of caramel, and burnt brown sugar. Slightly boozy. I was expecting some coffee/espresso notes, but they werent there, but that isnt necessarily a bad thing.

M: Slightly still. But honestly, it wasnt a bad thing. If i could ""improve"" the beer, sure I would add a bit more bubbles to my brew, but it works the way it is. Its got a nice weight to it, but it doesnt sit like a rock.

O: Quite enjoyable. Not the pinnacle of the style, but a damn good one that contributes nicely to the available brews. The 12.10abv is nicely managed here and the small bottle size is a treat. No need to slug through a massive bomber or 750 when I can get a nice single serving and move along.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

The taste is practically the same as the aroma with vanilla and bourbon being the most noticeable then some chocolate shows up.

Aroma: Nose was tons of bourbon (read: booze, booze, and more booze), vanilla, and some wood

Appearance: It pours an oily black color with a brown head and a bit of lace

Flavor: The taste is sweet and malty with a lots of bourbon flavor

Palate: This one is on the oily side, thick, heavy, and even a little chewy

Overall Impression: 
This beer was alright, but I just found it to be too boozy for my personal taste.  I have no qualms with many liking it more then I, and perhaps with more age it would have been more to my liking, but at this point in time it was just too much bourbon for me, if I want to drink bourbon, I wouldnt have opened a beer.

Surprisingly big on wood, loads of spice, quite a bit of alcohol, liquorice, oxidized notes, dark fruity notes, vanilla, almost perfumy in the vanillaness. Some caramel as well, or perhaps suryp. Surprisingly mellow on the bourbon. Initially very sweet on the tongue, it dries up quite a bit in the finish because of the alcohol which almost abrasive, a bit like drinking a pure spirit. Thick and viscous, with just a slight hint of prickling on the tongue, so not entirely flat. Most definitely a sipper, Im an hour in and still got quarter of a bottle left. I got to say, the aroma is amazing, but on the tongue its a bit too rough.","Årnes, NORWAY","Kestral"
320,"2010-03-04",3.6,"2009 bottle.  Pours a dark brown with just a smidge of head.  Aroma of bourbon, molasses, chocolate, vanilla, oak, nougat, maple syrup, coffee.  Flavor seems a little less complex and more muddy in my mouth -- still plenty of bourbon with sweet malt, lots of syrupy molasses and vanilla.  So overall, I guess I wasnt so impressed with it, although it is a lot better than lots of other bourbon barrel-aged beers.

S: The nose is very nice with notes of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. Perhaps a little bit of alcohol heat, but nothing overwhelming.

T: The great nose did not quite translate to the flavor. The flavor is very heavy on the bourbon, with the chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt flavors coming through more as the beer warms up. Unfortunately, so does the alcohol.

M: The body is full, and the carbonation is sufficient for the style, but could use some more bubbles.

Comment:
As I poured this I was quite surprised as it didnt look like Old Viscosity. It was completely flat and when I smelled it the first thing that came to mind was port wine. I had a glass of red wine available compared the two and there where several similarities. After tasting it I realised it had allot of red wine flavours. But also whisky and a mix of other alcoholic beverages.

Not sure what would fit with this beer but I imagine the same thing that works with strong red wines, or port wines, with lots of flavour.

This was an unexpected and interesting experience. I expected the same beer only with some wood and whisky flavour. But this version was a completely different beer.I quite enjoyed it though.","Örebro, SWEDEN","olsvammel"

The flavor was bitter and very woody with strong anise and moderate port wine, raisin, tobacco and chocolate. The finish was long with bitter woodiness. The body was flat and a touch thin.

320,"2010-02-15",4.4,"15-FEB-2010, bottle @home, from ""Barley Wine"".
Very exited to see what this is:) Not easy to find, and quite expensive, so I really hope for something special.
And it is...
...it pours almost black with an yellow edge, and oh - no head at all. Is this really strong ale? It looks like stout. You can tell the viscosity and density just from swirling the beer in the glass.
Beautifull color, and the yellow reflections are special, but a beer should have some sort of head (!) so only a 4 for appearance.
Wonderfull vanilla and chocolate nose, some roasted coffee, but mostly the barrels come through. Thats an 8 for aroma.
Taste is very complex with leather, tobacco and liqourice. Best tasting beer ever? 10 for taste.
Palate is difficult to rate. No carbonation at all, and a beer should have that(! - again), but at the same time the most dense beer I can imagine. And the alcohol is doing things to my mouth that I enjoy. It can really be felt, but is still quite well integrated.. How do you rate that? I end with up with 3 for palate.
Overall, maybe the best beer ever? With some carbonation in this beer it could easily be my number one, but now I end up giving it 4.4 all in all.
What is it with the carbonation, anyway? Has it gone due to the long travel time? Or was it never there?
Well, next time I see something from Port Brewing, I will be buying without hesitation.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","jesperhammer"
320,"2010-02-14",4.0,"Bottle from Ølbutikken, Copenhagen. Its younger brother - Old Viscosity is a high class beer - its yummie. To be saved in bourbon barrels and thus knocked up with vanilla like sweetness normally doesn´t do  much good for either stouts or strong ales. But lets give it a shot. The cork vitness of very low on carbonation when popped - or these one didn´t pop..it had to be squeezed off. The pour is brown differs to a brownie blackness. No head. The nose is so packed with the bourbonbarrels. The vanilla i smassive but there is also spices, tobacco and some roastyness with some plums or raisins in liquor. The taste is better than most borbon aged I have had. The sweetness and vanilla / marzipan-like taste is not that overwhelming and it leaves room for other notes. . There is some mild smokyness, leather and tobacco notes. The palate is oily like the containes of the engine from the truck on the label. The alcohol is picking your tounge and leaves a long bitter and roasted finish. Certainly a good beer - and a aged one where there still is some balance - thats nice.

This beer pulls off thick and rich better than any other beer that Ive tried.  The bourbon note is big and strong, but it doesnt get in the way of the underlying stout.  In fact, I find the oaky bourbon flavor balances the beer quite nicely.  The beer is rich with coffee, cocoa, prunes and brown sugar, yet its not sticky or cloying.  Its definitely a slow sipper.

Lots of sweet bitter dark chocolate, toffee, subtle coffee and hints of dark fruit, especially grape, prune, raisin, plum and fig. Slightly vinous with sweet alcohol notes and a strong bourbon presence that lasts throughout. Subtle earthy oak tannis with a good bit of vanilla that helps cut down the bourbon heat but the flavor is pretty much dominated by the prominent bourbon character. Sweet and surprisingly not too hot at 12%. ABV decently masked but the bourbon presence gives it a lot of liquor taste. Overall pretty drinkable.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

The nose is dominated by it with just glimpses of oak, vanilla, and chocolate peeking through. Bourbon is the major player in the flavor department as well, just a bit of vanilla and cocoa come through and they may have come from the bourbon. Body is medium-thin. Not at all impressed with the flavor but have to hand it to them for making this as smooth as it is. Would never have guessed that it is 12% abv.","Mountville, Pennsylvania, USA","afireinside96"

320,"2009-11-30",4.2,"2009 bottle.
no pop when uncorked, this pours completely flat. its brown-black and fairly thick.
aroma is of charcoal, bourbon, malt, chocolate milk, coffee, figs, roasted nuts, and smoke. 
flavor is sweeter, more chocolate milk, with a harsh alcohol front, biting middle and long bittersweet chocolate liquor finish.
the harsh coal elements persist throughout (should have aged it?), and this isnt really beer, but its interesting.
not sure how to rate something that looks, smells, and tastes like liquid charcoal.
also, body was disappointingly thin given the description of ""sludge"", but had a rich velvety smoothness.","New York, USA","kopher"

320,"2009-11-22",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 11, 2012 My Bottom Line:
Vanilla-like bourbon notes add depth to this strong ales molasses-bearing malts, as surreptitious miso notes brush roasted and chocolatey flavors. This is one serious creation.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the darkness.
-The body is marvelously rich yet never tiresome. Gum-lickin good!
-Alcohol heat is emboldened by the barrel flavors.
-Carbonation is rather low, which works with the wealthy but calculated dextrins.

320,"2009-10-29",4.2,"375 ml bottle courtesy of TheEpeeist and a trade long ago, probably our first. Thanks, Chris! 2008 bottle, I believe. Pours an inky thick black, opaque and murky, no light even on the edges, straight black with a dark brown big bubbly head that dies to a moderate layer, laces pretty well. Aromas are a nice layer of bourbon, wet oak, vanilla, not overly boozy, but a nice sufficient layer, letting some nice roasted malts shine through, a touch of chocolate and cream, good dark fruits of plum and raisins. Nice. Initial is full, a good feel for bourbon without getting annoying or overly boozy, as vanilla, oak, and a good bitterness grab the back end. Chocolate and creaminess, caramel, smoothed out, mixing with lighter coffee, roasted malts, and a full feel. This beer coats the palate, but doesnt take a too heavy or syrupy of a body on. Reminds me vaguely of Capricho Oscuro Batch #2. Dark fruits slip in behind the scenes, raisins more now, a touch of cakiness, nut, caramel. Leaves a solid bitterness on the palate from roast and coffee. Carbonation is not a deterrent in this beer, as there is a good amount that gives a a nice body, light tickle on the palate that accentuates the roast and bitterness and dryness. Very nice.. as the bourbon isnt dominant, but has a very synergistic quality to it. Touch of maple syrup. I guess I should have tried the base first though.

Long rich nutty rum raisin aftertaste that is just slightly ashy.  Full bodied, lighter side though, smooth and creamy, avoids being heavy, and also avoids the sticky syrupness of regular viscousity, fine sizzling carbonation that improoves the beer without detracting.

320,"2009-09-08",3.3,"The lack of carbonation really hurts this beer. Pours completely and utterly flat. No carbonation AT ALL. I think I am now done with Lost Abbery till they get this shit fixed. The only thing Ill get from them till I find out otherwise is sour ales. Nose is a little smoke, wood and leather with a bit of cherry pit. Pretty nice nose. Looks a dead black with no head. Flavor is very muted, some light smoke and leather and some bourbon but nothing seems to really hang together, I know from experience that carbonation really helps bring some of this stuff together. The body is super heavy without any carbonation to help it along. Viscous and coating. Really disappointing.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
320,"2009-09-01",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2010 375mL 2010 ed corked and caged into Lost Abbey raster glasses. This is a total re-rate after having a bad batch from 2009. Poured a near black, clear deep brown, with a medium, dense, brown head that leaves swathes of sticky lace everywhere. Aroma also has lots of vanilla, coconut, roasted macadamia nut, vanilla, spicy oak. Not as intense as the normal Old Visc in the nose- more refined. Flavor is rich in cinnamon, burnt wood, roasted malt, charred earth, lots of drying oak. Dry, velvety, soft carbonation on the palate.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
320,"2009-08-31",3.0,"[Bottle] Pours black and absolutely dead ass fuckin flat. Aroma is really quite nice and full despite no bubbles to help volatilize it, huge sweet bourbon barrel nose, vanilla, and coconut, hints of bittersweet chocolate,  and booze. Flavor is strong and rich, but again, without any carbonation, it just dangles flaccid and uninteresting on the tongue. There is lots of booze and bourbon, barrel tannin, dry chocolate, and a real chalkiness. If this was carbonated it would be fantastic, but as it sits in my glass, its just another mediocre offering from Tomme Arthur. This whole Abbey thing really gives me the vibe of him being like one of those scary evangelical preachers that promises to deliver you to whatever respective mecca theyre selling you, but it just all ends up being one big scam. Well luckily my investment to this point has been fairly limited.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","MatSciGuy"
320,"2009-08-24",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 4, 2010 Draft at bottleworks. Pours inky black wirh just a small ring of head. Aroma starts with chocolate and deep, well balanced alcohol.

Dark liquid with reddish highlights around the top when held to light. Nice mocha colored head and lace.

Smells of booze and dark fruits, dark dark malt: Chocolate and roasted variety.

Really incredible taste, Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, cream, hint of roasted malt. Bourbon level is high but not burninating.

Mouth is thick and low in carbonation. Warming feeling doesnt start until the end of the drink.

Just an amazing, amazing brew.","Donora, Pennsylvania, USA","Sonicdescent"
320,"2009-08-18",4.1,"Bottle. Im rating two years side by side but they managed to be very similar so it counts like one. Pours pretty much black with huge chocolate head. Aroma is kind of lighter than youd expect but has bourbon present along with some chocolate and toffee. Flavor is potent with bourbon, oak, vanilla and rich roasty malts. Smooth beyond belief. Not overpowering in the least and the alcohol is hard to find, this one really does not fall under the category of challenging huge beers but instead along the lines of well crafted and well balanced drinkable barrel aged goodness. Among the BB releases I find the 08 to be the most subtle at this time. Good lord I wish I had bigger bottles of this stuff.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","MadMan"
320,"2009-08-14",4.4,"On tap at Brouwers. Cool thing is this sucker was tapped when Liquid Sunshine VIII met there. This was an awesome surprise. Dark black with nice chocolate head. Head sticks around for some time; nice looking beer. Nice pungent wood/whiskey aroma. Not a stout? As with Old Viscosity, I dont understand this, but oh well. Slight sweet chocolate aroma as well. Nice complex aroma. Very strong whiskey/alcohol at first, then a nice chocolate/wood taste after that. Very nice complex flavor. Very bold. Whiskey is strong, but I like that type of thing. Very rich and smooth palate. So glad to have tried this one. Overall, complex and strong. Get ready to try that whiskey. Great brew.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"
320,"2009-08-11",3.8,"Draft at Brouwers Cafe, after someone else at the table (I forget who) talked them into tapping this, thanks to them. Poured black, with a thin dark-tan head. Really bourbony, almost too much. Toffee, mocha/chocolate, nuts, gorgeous molasses character. Starts very expressive, and moves right on into dominating from there. A huge beer, just over-dominated by the bourbon.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","Savvy1982"

320,"2009-08-10",3.8,"[Bottle, thanks Guerde!] Pours dark brown with a good brown head. The aroma is probably the weakest point of the beer, and is primarily coconut from the bourbon, alcohol, and a little chocolate. The taste is big on coconut again, but also brownies, alcohol, malt, and a little oak. Quite thick mouthfeel, smooth, and has a long finish. Overall this is a nice beer that is enjoyable, but quite simple--especially in the aroma. Thanks again, Andy!","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"
320,"2009-08-09",3.9,"(375ml corked and caged bottle thanks to mar) Pours black with dark tan head. Nose is alcoholic, cumin, toasted spices.

320,"2009-08-05",3.5,"Had a couple other versions of this as well, but this rating now is the 2008 375mL bottle.  Clear deep deep brown with a dark mahogany two finger head, good retention.  Aroma of clean chocolate malt up front with bourbon, vanilla, oak, sweet scorched caramel and light smoke.  Theres also a bit of licorice.  The flavor is much more boozy with burnt charred malts (which I dont enjoy) along with an odd sour grape character, though it isnt too strong.  Dry finish with bourbon and charred malts, bitterness peaking around a 4.  Full thick body with moderate carbonation.  Smelled good, didnt taste as good.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

320,"2009-07-29",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2009 2009 bottle:

Lucious nose dripping with vanilla, bourbon, caramel, malted milk balls, chocolate covered fresh orange peel, authentic black licorice, and straight up booze.  Pours dark but flat and completely headless...extremely uninviting.  The flavors are big and harsh and there is not a single indication of carbonation whatsoever.  The alcohol is hot and peppery at the back the throat...the chocolate is in your face and bitter...in fact, the bitterness, the chocolate, the hot boozy bourbon...it makes me want to fucking puke.  I am draining pouring a $15 375ml bottle.  I had the 09 on draft a few days earlier...I remember not liking it but then again I was comparing it to bourbon barrel santas little helper at the time and everything tastes like shit compared to that beaut...I couldnt tell how awful this shit is.  Now that I drink it alone...I can see what a putrid substance this shit is.  I have 3 more bottles, ill probably drink one more when maybe Im more in the mood for this style of beer.  The other two Im setting on fire and tossing into the lost abbey brewery during a drive-by maltov cocktail party. - 8-2-4-1-8.  

What a hater...re-rate on draft at GABF 2009:  With carbonation, it was easily one of the very best beers on the floor...smooth, silky, vanilla-induced bourbon bliss...if those bottles were carbonated, Id leave work right now and buy the rest of the them at wholefoods to add to my 3 i have in my cellar.  Unfortunately, theyre all flat.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
320,"2009-07-22",4.6,"On tap at 1702 in Tucson.  Quite a bit like Old Viscosity, but the oak is definitely present, lending very smooth hints of vanilla  to the already present espresso beans, toffee, caramel, copious amounts of chocolate, burbon, roasted malt, and perhaps a few hints of darker fruits, such as plum.  It pours BLACK with a nice amount of brown head. How much more black could it be, you ask? None.  None more black. The aroma is alluringly of licorice, chocolate, and malts, and the texture is extremely thick and rather smooth. Definitely gets better as it approaches room temperature, and is probably best just below room temperature.  This beer was unbelievable.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Plamadude30k"

I got bits of espresso, wood, toasted malt, bitter chocolate and a tiny bourbon note in the nose. Taste is of heavily roasted malt, toffee, licorice, overly ripe fruit and creme brulee. Could detect a little oak and vanilla as the beer warmed up.  Mouthfeel wasnt as thick as I thought it might be, but definitely solid and not at all thin. The bourbon hit me in the finish with a huge dry sour mash character.  This brewery just keeps rolling out some ridiculous beers. Exceptional!","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"

320,"2009-05-18",4.4,"Sample portion.  A rare treat that did not disappoint. Pours dark brown, opaque, with a healthy brown head.  Flavor is dark chocolate, molasses, coffee, maybe some bourbon essence.  Palate is really interesting, evolving from soft and thinner than expected, to rolling soft carbonation, to a thicker, lingering finish.  Flavor is a really nice cocoa powder vanilla blend initially, which rides a wave of carbonation towards complex roastiness, bittersweet chocolate and molasses.  Finishes downright full of flavor, full of layered chocolate-mocha and roasts.  Excellent, I hope to have a whole bottle to myself soon.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

Sweet, smooth entry with some moderate chocolate and molasses leads into a strong bourbon booziness with some chalk, oak, and a bit of light, lingering roast on the finish.  Low carbonation and decent mouthfeel.  Overall, this was a solid beer, but it tends to be an example of barrel aging overshadowing the base beer, which I really like.

12.7 fl oz bottled, corked and caged, from the Sinners Club. 2008 Vintage. Served out of the wine fridge at 55 degrees into my Stone IRS tulip. Pour is hazy full black, with a big loose 4 inch khaki head. Head crackles and falls with a lot of noise and some pretty lacing. This is a pretty beer. Aroma is initially quite big on the resin and oak wood of the barrels, after that fades a bit, some strong licorice, roasted malt and a decent amount of alcohol heat. This is actually more of the wood and heat than I remembered, bordering on overpowering. Taste is the big wood oakiness right away, very strong tannins, very Bourbony and very sharp with the barrel. The licorice and roast of the nose are present, though a bit lost behind the wood, booze and Bourbon. There is some nice dark chocolate to the finish, which helps bring things together a bit. Palate is medium-thick, coats the mouth a bit before the tannins of the wood and the alcohol heat dry it back out. Aftertaste is long, and warming. This beer has come together a bit since I last had it, but it still just a monster of a beer. As before, well made, still not entirely my thing. (7,5,7,3,14 - 3.6)

12.7 fl oz bottled, corked and caged, from the Sinners Club. 2008 Vintage. Pour is deep hazed black, with a firm two inch deep tan head. Nice coating lace left on the glass as the head falls. Pretty beer. Aroma of roast malt and bitter dark chocolate. The bourbon and barrel is also present, though nicely behind and melded with the roast maltiness. Some soy and licorice comes out as it warms, followed by a fair amount of alcohol. Taste is big and brash, the melding of the nose yields to flavor spikes of Bourbon, oak barrel tannins, the roasted malt, and a touch of the soy and licorice of the nose. The pine bitter hoppiness is harsh and accents all of the other flavors. Alcohol comes through clean and hot in the aftertaste, followed by smoky roastiness. The alcohol is very warming, and stung my chest. Palate is medium to thick,sludgy, mouth coating, yet still somewhat viscous. The aftertaste, as mentioned is long and hot. If you like wood, booze and Bourbon, this is your beer. Not exactly my thing, but it was well done. (8,5,6,4,13 - 3.6)","Kansas, USA","theisti"

320,"2009-04-08",3.7,"375ml bottle. Pours a dark, opaque brown capped by a thick and lasting dark khaki head leaving spotty lacing. Aroma is pretty standard for the style... lots of whiskey barrel, charred and slightly astringent malt, green pepper, anise, char... perhaps some bitter chocolate. Minimal hop profile. Boozy and rather simplistic. Palate is rather dry and unforgiving. Dark and slightly astringent roasted malt. Peppery and spicy... but not in a way that I enjoy. The 12% is hidden quite well. Some dark, bitter chocolate, dry wood, dry malt. Vanilla extract, dusty hops. Medium bodied... not nearly as viscous as Id hoped. Slightly chalky initial mouthfeel with a tannic, boozy finish.

2007 Bottling

Received this in a trade with Stoneman78, thanks! Older Viscosity glops out the bottle with the weight of a heavy motor oil. Its difficult to even get a soft pour as the viscous body gurgles from the neck. Needless to say the body is as black as the ace of spades. The pour produced a minimal beige head of about one finger that fell to a thin cap and fat ring after a few minutes. Each sip leaves some lacing behind that eventually falls back into the body. 

The nose has a great depth of complexity. The oak barrel aging plays the most significant role with notes of slightly damp oak and hints of vanilla. A touch of bourbon flashes through along with dark chocolate, brown sugar, and cocoa in that order. The bourbon presence grows as this beer warms. Im not really pulling much else out of the aroma but what is there is very appetizing. It would get a better score if there was more of a beer profile than so much of a bourbon and oak profile. 

The flavor runs along the lines the aroma suggested. Theres alcohol heat from beginning to end. Now I love a solid alcohol presence in some of my bigger beers but this one is just a little too hot. Dark chocolate, brown sugar, and cocoa all come back in the aroma rising and falling as it works its way through. Again, its the bourbon barrel aging that takes this beer over. Bourbon, alcohol spiciness, damp oak, and mild vanilla are the most common denominators of this beer. As it gets close to room temperature it melds slightly better but its still a touch too hot.

The mouthfeel at first sip seemed a little on the thin side but as this beer warms it allows the body a chance to thicken up and become as viscous as the label suggests. The body is coating and rich with minimal carbonation which lets the body work through at its own pace. The heat works its way through my mouth, nose, and down my throat, warming my cheeks on its way.

The drinkability is limited by the alcohol presence. This is a very good sipper whether it be an after dinner drink or a cold weather beer this is one to enjoy slowly. It took me over an hour to finish the bottle and it just kept getting better.

I had high hopes for this brew and while it delivered on some aspects it fell short on others. There is a little more bourbon character then Id like but it is very good. I wouldnt mind having a few more to see if they cool down over time.

Pours dark, dark brown out of the bottle and settles in the glass as pitch black with a small tan head. It recedes to a ring quickly leaving spotty lacing.

The nose is massive and smells like the inside of a bourbon barrel. It’s got the oak, vanilla and bourbon throughout with a big dark roasted malt base and even some raisins and chocolate thrown in.

The taste certainly follows from the aroma and has the barrel character from start to finish. There seems to be a bit more dark fruits, raisins and figs, not to mention the roasted coffee and dark chocolate as well. Very complex and with a dry, slightly bitter finish.

The mouthfeel is perfect - super smooth and slick with minimal carbonation leaving a sticky barrel presence in the mouth.

320,"2008-09-19",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2011 2007 Bottle (9/19/2008 ). Yum, a real delight! Oak and bourbon tones are not overly in your face like a lot of bourbon barrel aged beers. A lot of sweet caramel and vanilla flavors. Warms in the mouth. Definitely drinks like a port. 

2009 bottle served 3/1/2010. The appearance is a beautiful glossy flowing back. No head no carbonation. The nose is strong with bourbon, figs, plums, and heavy roasted malts. A good amount of alcohol in the nose as well. The flavors are very complex. A lot of bourbon, port, figs, prunes, other dried dark fruits, more bourbon, dark cherries, heavy roasted malts. The flavors are distracted with a lack of carbonation. A good grainy wet oak flavors as well.  I wish it wasnt so distracting but it is and it makes the alcohol heat be more upfront. I didnt adjust my score as far down since the sample I have from a 2010 bottle was so phenomenal. I will take more notes when I open my bottle of that.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"

320,"2008-08-29",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2009 Wow. This one was an incredible treat. Bottle at a PB/LA tasting at Brouwers (Tomme Arthur present). I spent a good few minutes savoring the aroma before the first sip. It reminded me of a cross between a dusty attic and a sauna. Oak (lots of it), bourbon (perhaps a bit of scotch), sweet malts, dark brown sugar, vanilla and smoke come through in the aroma. The taste adds powerful notes of cocoa and coffee, with spices and just a tad of black licorice at the end. Like its name suggests, this one is almost chewably thick. It drinks like a port, but is amazingly smooth and finishes incredibly clean. The carbonation manages to keep it from actually feeling like a motor oil, and the oak from those barrels comes through more with each sip. So glad I got to try this one - just wonderful.   RERATE 08-09-09. Secret tap @ Brouwers (off the menu). Boozier than I remember. Flavor and aroma profiles are the same, and its as thick as I remember. More cocao, and lots more bourbon. Still wonderful, especially from the tap... but Im docking a point for the booze.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"
320,"2008-08-28",4.6,"0.375L bottle.  Wow.  What an enticing aroma.  I just soaked up the aroma for about 4 minutes before tasting it.  Incredibly smooth bourbon and oak aroma with a bit of alcohol.

320,"2008-08-24",4.3,"Pours almost a pitch black color with a very small off white head. Aroma is of vanilla, coffee, bitter chocolate, and bourbon. Flavor was a lot more mellow than I was expecting. The bourbon and the chocolate, really melded well together with a hint of vanilla sweetness, and a nice alcohol burn in the swallow. I liked this way better than the regular.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
320,"2008-08-23",4.4,"2007 vintage poured (finally) into a Duvel tulip glass.

Appearance is super dense black-brown hue, nice layer of brown creamy head dissipates to a thin layer of spotty bubbles, thick lacing on the glass.

Smell is initially characterized by absolutely delicious chocolate malts accentuated by stiff bourbon, woody oak, vanilla extract, and molasses, also present are tones of coffee and roast malts, dark fruits, and toffee, absolutely amazing!

Initial taste follows the nose and is comprised of cocoa-sweet malts, bourbon-whiskey wood, and a tinge of dark fruits, espresso-like malts enter midway along with vanilla, cherries, caramel, toffee and brown sugar, finishes with an emphasis on the dark fruits and bourbon.

Mouthfeel is full-bodied, silky velvet-like texture takes and edge of the omnipresent bourbon edge, mild-moderate carbonation.

Drinkability is high despite the 12%abv, an amazing profile of malts leads the charge here and is balanced out by the dark fruit and bourbon/wood accents, I can see this beauty only improving over time as the hotness will likely subside, no surprise here, I have drank the Kool-Aid and readily admit that Older Viz lives up to its billing, get some if you can!","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"

Long finish from the rich body.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
320,"2008-08-04",3.4,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2009 Bottle at Lost Abbey RBSG. Last bottle of Tomme’s tasting. Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head. The aroma is strong with whiskey, dark roasted grains and leather. The taste is remarkable; the bourbon whiskey is well balanced by oodles of sticky sweet black licorice,  rounding out the sides--coffee and biter chocolate. The mouthfeel was full and creamy. The finish was long and dry with lingering anise. Overall: Another winner. Perhaps this one is not hyped as much as it deserves. I loved it.

Dense, low-lying aroma of molasses, leather, bourbon, chocolate, cream, and toasted oatmeal.  I will attempt to describe the taste, but I know I will not do it justice.  Creamy bitter dark chocolate, with an earthy toasted caramel malt.  Notes of vanilla, molasses, tobacco, burnt coffee, and oak.  The bourbon comes through near the back and in the finish.  It rounds the flavors out perfectly without turning the beer into a boilermaker.  Worth every penny of the $20 I paid for it.","San Diego, California, USA","trokini"

320,"2008-06-29",4.4,"Corked bottle. I have been sitting on this for not too long, maybe 6 months. This is a hugely complex and rich beer. The bourbon barrel aging is apparent in the sweetness.

320,"2008-06-25",4.0,"375ml from Lost Abbey (Saints or Sinners, whichever it was). Its got the same motor oil pour as its cousin, though somehow it seems slightly less oleaginous (yes, I have used this adjective in each review - its a slept-on word, come on). Fairly lively carbonation, though the head is on the minimal side. You can smell the oaking in there for sure, and its thankfully not that cloying, fake-smelling, vanilla crap that so many breweries seem to coast with. Theres something deeply woody, funky, and Id say earthen about it. And it really nicely complements the molasses, jerky, chocolate flavors going on in this wondrous beer. Its ever so slightly hot, and the bourbon flavors are a shade too assertive. But its a great one, and I hope to try it again sometime.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Hardcore alcohol, barrel, chocolate, burnt malt, treacle toffee, excellent spice and bitterness with tons of sugary sweetness from the alcohol. This is a MASSIVE beer.

This thing lacked the character from the first time around.  Lots of bourbon in this one to the detriment of everything else which could be described as subtle.  Some chocolate notes and a lot more ""stouty"" than I remember.  Bumping this one down from the original 4.8 review.","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"
320,"2008-04-05",4.0,"Dark brown-black pour....love the aroma as much as the younger variety.  Big wood, vanilla, bourbon...all the good stuff.  Flavor is terrific...slightly sweet, dark fruits, more bourbon wood..light licorice.  Not as full bodied as Id expected but that doesnt detract from the enjoyment.  Wish I couldve gotten this in a bomber----or bigger!  Ill always be on the lookout for this gem.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"
320,"2008-03-10",4.8,"Rating #100.....finally an excuse to open this one.

Bottle via mailorder from Joey at South Bay Drugs And Liquor.


Appearance


Pours like motor oil 10,000 miles past when it should have been changed with a small yet bubbly light brown head.

Smell

Aroma of bourbon, chocolate, roasted coffee beans, toasted barley, malt, and some hints of fruits.

Taste
Wow, this rich bourbony beast has a nice decadent chocolate, roasty coffee, bourbon all in wonder flavor going on. The mouthfeel is very full and amazing and the flavors all come together into a blissful co-existance. Notes of fruits linger at the finish but dont overpower the other desirable flavors of this beast.

Final Thoughts
Im very glad that I chose this as #100, it did not let me down in any way. This simply put is an amazing brew in a class of its own. Simply an amazing world class brew!!!","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Rusty"
320,"2008-03-09",4.9,"Bottle from JohnC. Pour was pitch black-brown, even a little choco colored thin head on the top that fizzled quickly but left behind a nice ring, regenerable with a swirl, active carbonation in the mouthfeel later. The aroma was oaky wood, chocolate, maple, bourbon. The flavor was all of that, some molasses and licorice under there, just a wonderful BA brew, the best one Ive had in a while, beer was actually there. Mouthfeel had a nice tingle from the carbonation and alcohol, yet this thing was a beer. Man, that finish was outstanding, perfect highlight to the whole experience. Great stuff, and thanks to John for this one! Top 50, no doubt.","","User37895"

Flavor also shows dark fruits and roasty malts, fig, fudge chocolate, bourbon, alcohol, oak, light spice and herbs - it seems a little hot still.  Full body, little to no carbonation.

Pours dark brown with nearly no carbonation released, so it looks oily, vinuous, flat, etc, but after a few seconds a firm but short brown head forms and were back where we should be.  Hugely inviting nose that balances some of the fruity malt qualities (plum, oranges, cherry tobacco) with the wood and bourbon (on the sweeter side, but not overly sweet).  Flavor is the same: sweet, nearly-peppery bourbon and oak wood, with some sweet, fruity plum, brandy, lemon, orange, leafy greens (arugula?), finishing with a prickly, sweet, musky, rich, tannic and dry bourbon barrel/wood note, lasting for minutes it seems.  A really, really good beer, but sweeter than it needs to be at times, and I think if were drier it would be the bees knees.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

  From notes: Pours completely still, and of course is completely black. It is not, however, as black as some other big stouts out there. Smells chocolatey, with vanilla and bourbon coming through loud and clear. Alcohol is noticeable. 
  This beer tastes as good as any BA stout. The bourbon barrel flavor would be too much in another beer, but this one has a vast richness of other flavors as well. Lots of chocolate. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and coating. Truly one of the GOAT.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","Sephiroth"

L: Looks just like the brownish black of motor oil and the pour is similar too. Tiny fizzy head that quickly gives way to a fine line of bubbles, look syrupy thick in the glass.

S: Vanilla and woody bourbon barrels, prunes and dark chocolate cake, and sugary, estery alcohol. Bare hints of black licorice way out at the edges of the aroma. This is one of the more uniquely smelling beers Ive had in awhile.

F&T: Syrupy, but lighter feeling than what I was expecting, full bodied and chewy without being overly thick, oily on the tongue and alcoholic dry. The taste of bourbon whiskey is first thing I noticed, followed by a vanilla woodiness. Malty flavors of dark roasted coffee cut with Belgian chocolate, raw cane sugar and black molasses, the fruitiness of cherries and prune juice, finishes with tastes of sweet caramel toffee. The alcohol mixes with the bourbon and cherry/prune concoction for a low, but lingering whiskey soaked fruity warmth in the palate.

Virtually no lacing, but thick sheets of leggy body coat the glass, proving that this brew lives up to its name.  The aroma is rich and intense, with fumy bourbon greeting the nose right off the bat. Malty notes of dark chocolate and molasses follow, as does a woodsy, oaky vanilla component.  The flavor is a bit more roasty than the nose indicates, though the bourbon and vanilla are again fully present.

Gentle cocoa flavor at first, followed by heavy dark chocolate, bourbon, wood, lighter licorice, and more vanilla than the aroma.

Similar to a beer like Pannepot, where the finish has as much flavor as the initial sip, and tastes very different.

Really, its not that bad -- but a cold, cruel bourbon dominates the aroma like gin in a martini. A thick, suitably viscous palate carries a sludgy, plummy chocolate syrup home. Pouring a droopy black with no head, this beer looks as punishing as it tastes.

Pours dark and thick with an tan head into a Duvel tulip.  I wanted something big and boozy tonight, and this fits the bill. Burnt cinnamon toast, chocolate, and heavy bourbon vanilla. Flavor is a bit more sour than one expects and perhaps a touch less sweet. Cocoa nibs late as the bitter-sour sweeps through. As before, the aroma offers more than the flavor can deliver. I wonder if its already starting to thin out with 5 years in the cellar. The original rating seems to be in the right ballpark.
2008 bottle sampled Dec 2016 in a Samichlaus . Eight years in its holding up OK. Maybe thinning a bit, but if I was worried about it sliding downhill three years ago it certainly isnt falling apart fast! Pretty much exactly as advertised, though Id have called it at 9% rather than 12%, so some credit there or at least value of aging. Once again, the original 3.8 seems on the mark.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

The next whiff was a dryer oak to red wine combination. Then I get more tasty caramel aromas again along with toffee and is that chocolate too. The taste starts with a brief burst of sweetness. Then red wine dryness and tartness hit and move into more tartness toward the finish. The caramel and toffee noted in the nose are faint and somewhat hidden in the back. I get some oak in there too but it is subtle and residing in the background sort of throughout the taste experience. Not at all what I was expecting based on the aroma and what Old Viscosity tastes like. The barrel aging has had a big influence.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

320,"2007-09-18",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 17, 2009 Thanks to drewbeerme for this sample of Batch 1.  We did a vertical with a fresh Old Vis, a bottle aged 1 year, and this the older Vis.  All three were surprisingly different for better or worse.  Pours a dark black with a thing ring of a head.  The first note I pick up in the nose is soy .. but this fades into the rich dark chocolate and oak and of course surrounded in notes of bourbon.  Sweet and very creamy.  Chocolate, molasses, mocha, and oak barely peek out from under that overbearing bourbon.  The bourbon starts at slightly harsh and turns into pure bourbon on the rocks.  Whew.  Im sure the complexities will come out and this will improve after a few years but right now its too much.  I actually pour a little of the fresh old viscosity in this glass to mellow out that heat.  8/3/6/3/14 = 3.4

Aroma delves deep into fudgie chocolate cubes, dripping with sticky goop at the corners. Dark chocolate truffles laced with liquid mocha liquor. Singed hazelnuts and cocoa nibs droll dutifully wonderful in the distance with a hint of mellow oak. Flavor bellows rich abundance. Dark chocolate fudge engulfs the tongue with sweet bourbon and black rye combination, all blended into a creamy supplement and laid over oak. Warming mouthfeel captures a vibrant mocha cocoa grist amidst a nearly minty frangelico liquor cream character. Burnt hazelnuts get captured in dark chocolate for a blissfully darkened, nutty embellishment. Full bodied, woodsy cocoa and mocha bean fulfillment. Charming cocoa nib signature fades into dust and melting dark chocolate fudge as it sees itself out. Huge thanks for the bottle, tpkenned!","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

320,"2007-09-12",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2009 357ml bottle, Batch 1. sampled next to Old Viscosity first batch and 2007 vintage w/ portion aged in bourbon barrel. pours black with no head. nose is very bourbony, oaky, coconut, and lots of alcohol (really reminds me of GI BCS). flavor is pretty hot bourbon, coconut, chocolate, but then the finish comes on strong with bourbon flavor. just too much and hot. I bet this in 2-4 years would be awesome. really reminded me of GI BCS but not nearly as good. 3.5. 

4/25/08, Batch 2. aged 6 months. wow this is like night and day compared to batch 1. this is softer much more balanced and wonderful. really smooth and well blended. awesome brew. 4.1.

Early August 09, sampled a bottle of 2007 bottle, pours black with creamy tan head. looks good and with nice level of carbonation. this really become quite fruity, i mean lots of dark fruit in the nose and flavor where the bourbon, oak, and alcohol have really faded out. tasty but lost something special. 
8/28/09, 2009 batch, pours black with a slim off white head around the rim. the aroma is a smokey nutty bourbon with chocolate undertones. flavor has some sharp dark fruit and bourbon notes, smokey, the chocolate is there but underplayed and soy sauce and licorice rounds the whole thing out while charred malt/oak and alcohol sits on the palate. the barrel aging as really thinned this beer out but it really never started as some motor oil impy. in the end this is a tasty beer and best consumed within 6months of release. this vintage is almost flat and would improve with slightly more carbonation. anywhere near worth the asking price? hell no. 3.9.

10/29/09, 09 batch on draft at maproom. wow lots of bourbon in this compared to the bottled stuff. strong strong bourbon in a tobacco charred wood way, at times a bit rough going down. still enjoyed. 3.9.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

Lots of roasted malts, light cocoa, bourbon--but all a bit subdued. Flavor is similar. I now see why people think this and Old Viscosity tastes like an imperial stout.

320,"2007-07-11",4.0,"Pitch black with glowing brown edges and a small light brown head, little retention, oily. The aroma is very whisky tilted. Notes of bourbon, vanilla, licorice, raisins, some oak, light vinous bursts, sweet chocolate, deeply roasted malt, coffee, lots of alcohol. This has a refinement the base version does not but remains bold and weighty. The flavor is much the same, focus lying on the vinous, chococoffee and roast notes that underlie the crushing bourbon barrel foundation. Medium bitterness, light to medium acidity, heavy sweetness(not too heavy; in fact, the power here is derived from intense drying alcohol and bitter roastiness). Licorice and dark fruits fade away as the grip of whisky tightens its stranglehold on a tongue that can submit or give up tasting altogether...this is ruinous, defined, and what a lovely kind of palate tortuire it is. Very full bodied even if its decimated to a degree by lengthy barrel aging, viscous(it better be), oily and mildly sticky. Carbonation is low and sometimes not noticeable at all. Alcohol remains a force and drys the mouth further with each sip....this is quite the slow sipper. Finishes salty, oaky, dry and bitter. This is very good, though in the case of comparison, I preferred the rougher around the edges recipe that wasnt barrel aged.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

320,"2007-07-03",4.2,"Bottle at pre-RBSG tasting
The credit for this one goes to MrFacto.  I believe there was also a bottle of the Old Viscosity opened which I should have tried side by side.  Looking at my ratings now I find it hard to believe this is truly a full half point better than the other version.  If youd like to help me with a rerate I would not object to a bottle of each.
Aroma / Appearance - The deep black body lives up to its name.  This is not the darkest beer Ive ever seen but it certainly competes quite well with almost everything out there.  No carbonation is visible; I suspect even if you could see into the glass there would be none.  Lacing clung to the sides like film, coating my glass in layers of sediment.  The nose was sweet with hints of anise and cocoa playing against the pineapple, coffee and blackberries.  It smells very porterish with a dash of smoke for good measure.
Flavor / Palate - Straight black coffee, peat and smoke coat the palate from the first sip.  If you pay attention a pie like aftertaste is next, accompanied by charcoal, blueberries and anise.  I have to knock off a few points for the strong alcoholic presence or otherwise this would be close to a new Top 10 entry.  I dont know how Port Brewing/Lost Abbey does it but I have yet to come across a beer I would turn down.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

320,"2007-06-13",3.4,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2009 2008 Vintage; Sampled May 2009
Very well carbonated, overly so even, as a careful pour produces a long lasting, two-finger thick, nicely browned tan colored head.  The beer is quite black and opaque in color.  This has a nice bourbon induced fruitiness and vanilla note to it in the nose.  Dark chocolate mixes with concentrated sweet fig notes as well as some nice, distinct raisin notes and some toasted grain notes.  Despite the dark color there is not a whole lot of dark, roasted grain notes; there is perhaps a touch espresso like roast sharpness, some burnt nutty notes.  There is a nice, toasted coconut aroma here as well that ties the barrel and base beer notes together quite well.

The beer has a peppery, spritzy carbonation that is a bit too much for a beer like this.  Fortunately some vigorous swirling of my glass is all it takes to release the excess carbonation; this really helps to smooth out the body.  The beer finish has an acidic edge to it and a sharpness that is a bit too harsh for the creamy up front malt to drown it out; other notes of burnt broccoli and some heat and spiciness from the bourbon influence also pepper the finish.  There are other, smoother, tastier, roast grain notes of toasted dark chocolate and nicely browned whole-grain bread.  The coconut note from the aroma is here in the flavor as well.

Not bad, but wasnt quite as good as I was hoping.  This is better than the original, almost flat batch that I first had and in all truthfulness is enjoyable, but I was expecting a bit more from this batch due to the recent buzz.
Sampled May 2007
The beer is quite still; it shows browned sherry colored notes around an otherwise blackened dark chocolate body and has absolutely no head.  The nose has a very prominent bourbon-like aroma; notes of liquor soaked figs & cherries as well as notes of oak, vanillin, buttery wood and a smooth bourbon character are all part of the aroma.  Despite how well this smells at this point after having a full meal, I cant quite help but think where are the beer aromatics.

The beer is quite still tasting / feeling as is expected after it visibly not having any carbonation.  Still it has a thick enough body to feel viscous and the carbonation is not missed to much.  Rich bourbon flavors dominate the flavor profile as do flavors of buttery oak (which are quite big here) and a touch of vanilla.  Somehow, despite the dominance, the barrel / whiskey character is not too over the top for this beer.

This beer is much smoother than the regular version, which at times seemed on the verge of unbalanced; this instead is a great after dinner sipping brew.  The oak flavors in this brew integrate really well with the bourbon notes; it is hard to tell at times which is which (considering bourbon is oak flavored this makes sense); spicy oak notes, buttery wood and vanillin may all contribute to the perception of bourbon overtones.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

320,"2007-04-25",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2008 Rating = 07 batch.  Poured like motor oil, silky and syrup like.  Incredible aroma!!! - bourbon, vanilla, and roasted malt - outstanding.  This is easily one of my favorite brews!  The straightforward beer in old viscosity seems to be a perfect barrel aging base.  This doesnt get sticky bourbon sweet - but maintains a rounded character of bourbon, vanilla, cocoa, oak, chocolate, and burnt malts.  This is smooth, elegant, and warming while boasting the perfect carbonation.  The finish delivers in style - long and wild.  Im in love.  After trying the Fall 07 batch, all I could do was laugh (a bit more vanilla sweetness to balance out the hot booze of the 06).  Ive probably had this a dozen times and it never lets me down.

320,"2007-02-18",3.3,"Draught at EBF 2/10/07Oily, dark chocolate brownish-black colored body is fairly viscous and yields a dark tan head that rather quickly disperses, leaving some film but no real lace behind.  Clarity is medium-low to low.The aroma comes on slowly, not as I expected.  It dosent just blow you away with bourbon and malt right out of the gate, but gives a very dry, cocoa powder and char note at the start which gains light vanilla-cream sweetness, very crusty/crunchy roast notes and eventually draws from a large portion of bourbon and moderate oak character.  Oily, vinous, very dark and thick, it is only brightened by the spicy, dry alcohol and bourbon notes, with a touch of oily oak fruitiness.  Mostly a ton of rich dark chocolate and crunchy roast that sits heavily on the nose.  Medium-high to high strength of aroma with thick, but soft alcohol vapors being released with warming.Dark chocolate immediately starts things out dry, but sweet creamy, milk-chocolatey malts surge forth, and with some dry barrel notes mixing in to add a salty toffee flavor, it quickly becomes powerful.  Bourbon is very strong on the finish, with oaky vinousness and lots of semi-sweet vanilla.  Char lingers on in the aftertaste, as well as alcohol and dark fruits.  Texture is almost creamy, but the slick black malts and barrel aging produce some oiliness and dry-tannic feel to the texture as well.  Medium-full body, quite sweet, though not overbearingly so.  What I did find disappointing was a crusty, almost stale breadiness that had notes of old coffee grinds, cardboard and slight butteriness.  It hits about half way through and does yield to the bourbon, eventually, but does seem very dull/stale.

Ummm.......yeah, its a barrel aged beer.   Anyway, the texture of this beer is outrageously good, its almost velvety.  This is far beyond good, and its amazing what Thomme can do with this style.  Im gong to go out on a limb and say this is the best barrel aged beer I have had.  Close to the angels share, but I actually think I like this better.  A world class beer.","Poway, California, USA","Naven"
320,"2007-02-02",3.4,"RR Temptation type bottle from Sick_Boy282. Dark brown almost black. Thick with no head or carbonation. Aroma of wine, wood, chocolate, and of course bourbon. The taste was the same but with a dry finish. After it warmed it took on a strong bourbon barrel taste that became overwhelming. I actually became alittle nauseated. I like Old Viscosity better.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","Ty5592"
320,"2007-01-30",4.0,"Big thanks to Vac for this brew, I owe you one!  Nice bourbon aroma--which doesnt overpower you.  Black with a brown head and a nicely carbonated, full palate.  The taste is a good bourbon flavor with tastes of coffee, vanilla, and some warmth from that 12%.  Good flavor--well balanced.","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"

320,"2007-01-12",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2008 375 ml. bottle.  Purchased at the Source, the beautifally redisgned brewery in San Marcos.  Pours black as the darkest night, with a little thin tan head, barely much of a head.  The smell is sweet and strong with hints of dried fruit.  Very Aromatic.  The taste is quite strong sweet and delicious.  The alchol is not quite noticeable and the feeling of the brew really feels nice on the back of my throat.  I havent had the regular Old version in a while, but I remeber it being almost too overwhelming.  This brew is well tempered by the barrels and mellowed considerably.  It feels almost like a barley wine but not quite.  Good work Tomme and the guys at Port, this is a stellar brew.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"

320,"2007-01-01",4.0,"Tasted on tap at the 2006 Pizza Port Strong Ale Fest. This American Strong ale pours a deep brown color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is malt, vanilla and brown sugar, with a touch of wood. A medium to full bodied ASA/BW. Malts are caramel, cookie and toffee. Lots of brown sugar, molasses, vanilla and oak flavors. Very smooth tasting. Little or no carbonation in this sample. Touch of alcohol bite, but that is kind of expected at 12%. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
320,"2006-12-26",4.2,"I bought this today at the brewery from Tomme. It pours jet black with brown highlights and a thin brown head. The aroma is of plums, chocolate and vanilla.

320,"2006-12-03",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2007 375 ml bottle from Port Brewing:  Pure black color with a halo of light brown foam. Aroma is sweet with dark fruit, a hint of bourbon and some wood.

Full bodied, rich and smooth with modest carbonation.","San Diego (Mira Mesa), California, USA","papajohn"
320,"2006-11-28",4.2,"From a 375mL Bottle.  Poured at the brewery.  Pitch black, oily pour with a remarkable amount of toasted tan head considering the short time in the bottle.  Thick, dark malty aroma thats dripping with prune, raisiny, and figgy fruits.  A pleasant backing of bourbon rounds out the bouquet with a rich quantity of caramel and vanilla tones.  Full bodied, syrupy mouthfeel with a silky texture.  Sweeter and more vinous that the regular run of Old Viscosity.  The bourbon characters are definitely more up front and serve to make it more complex, especially with the increase in caramel and vanilla flavors.  Malty flavors of dark chocolate and deep fruits form a solid base.  A touch of cherry oak in the final smack.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
320,"2006-11-26",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2008 Poured at Port Brewing Company. Rich vinous aroma, dripping with syrupy Italian real marachino cherries, dark with caramelization and balsamic. Deep dark brown, with a caramel orange fringe and little head. Carbonation is a little restrained, but will come with time. Bright refined caramel corn flavor, along with toasted marshmallow and hazlenut creams. A very syrupy and rich presentation, but gentrified with the older oaky tones and a vinous quality that lends sophisiticatin to the sometimes brash leading edges. Sweeter, too, but not cloying or longing, as it leaves a crisp cherry finish. Excellent&#033;","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

320,"2006-11-12",4.2,"On tap at Bistros 1st Barrel-Aged Beer Festival.  Numerous 3 ounce samples.  Light, sour, lihtly funky aroma with some light bourbon notes present.  Sweet, caramelly, and peat notes are also present.  I also get a little coffee aroma, too.  Mostly opaque dark mahogany cola color with a dark brown head that is small with nice lacing.  Roasted, choco/coffee maltiness to start.  Rather warming.  Light bourbon notes are present in the start and in the finish.  Some light smokey flavors are also present late with a touch of booze.  Seems a little too carbonated for my liking.  Either way, this is an exquisite beer.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
