355,"2016-09-04",4.2,"05-05-16 // sample from Magnum bottle at Cantillon Quintessence 2015. Paired with rillettes of mackerel. Excellent blend of Cantillons Gueuze. Will even get better with some years. Excellent slight fruity sourness, with dry grapes notes, some wood and straw.","Mainz, GERMANY","Maracuja05"

355,"2016-05-23",4.0,"Magnum sampled at Quintessence. An interesting view at a new blend of aged lambic to offer a more mature gueuze. Really nice to see what the blend is like with the omission of the young lambic, would love to see how this one ages out over time.","Massachusetts, USA","gn0sis"

355,"2016-05-13",4.3,"Sample from magnum during Quintessence.
APPEARANCE: clear blond beer, nice stable white head.
NOSE: fruity, quite dry nose, hay.
TASTE: a lot dryer than usally, less sweet, lacks quite some carbonation, even though being somewhat matured already, probably lacks the sugars from the 1 year old. But not meaning that the taste is less! Not at all, loved this one a lot, hope they make and sell more of these!","Gent, BELGIUM","PriorL"
355,"2016-05-11",4.4,"Has a golden yellow color, with a nice, creamy head, falling to a nice ring of lacing.

Quite different, compared to their regular Gueuze, since this is truly and utmost funky. Smells of cream cheese, potatoe skin, and basement stored hay, producing an incredible funkiness, dominating the aromas in a challenging complex fashion. This gets completed by a limey peak, revealing the beers sour aspect.

Drinks with a medium, sparkly yet soft carbonation, perfectly feathered by its soft mouthfeel.

Potatoe from the nose, together with an untamed cheese and potatoe funkiness get transfered to the taste. Features a great, pungent green apple peel sourness, entangled into more dust and old leather. 

This is out of control, a funk monster on the tongue with a mellow, pleasant softness on the back end of the palate, handling a subtle but bone dry tartness in the most pleasant way.","GERMANY","aleigator"

355,"2016-05-09",4.0,"Sample from Magnum bottle @ Cantillon Quintessence 2016. Light hazy golden body with a small white head. Nose of musty grains, Tart citrus notes, funk, oak, notes of basement, dusty, tart, grapes, barnyard. Fun to have it side by side with a 1996 Gueuze.","Odense SV, DENMARK","hallinghansen"
355,"2016-05-09",4.4,"Sample from Magnum bottle during quintessence 16. Light hazy deep dark golden colour with an white ring on top. Nose of musty grains, tart citrus notes, Peel, oak, old cellar notes, dust, tart grapes, taste is imo very different compared to the normal geuze. Strong barnyard funk, tart notes, en lemons. I am wondering if all Magnum batches are blended with 4 year old lambic aswell? Lovely beer on an even more Lovely day.","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
355,"2016-05-07",3.8,"pours rather clear blonde. OK white head. Smell is dry, woody. Taste is dry, sour, woody, bit glue. Funk, rather sharp... Seems like I completely missed out on this being better than average, as I like many other geuzes more than this...","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"
355,"2016-05-06",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 6, 2016 Quintessence 2016. 33% each of 2, 3 and 4 year olds. Murky dustyness without feeling ""too old"". Usual wood, lemon, sourness and straw much like regular gueuze.","SWEDEN","manker"
355,"2016-05-06",4.0,"Beer tried at quintessence. 

This beer tastes a lot like the ordinary Geuze! Some more complex flavours since it was aged for a while in a magnum bottle. Good to try!","Stockholm, SWEDEN","Ludvig"
355,"2016-05-06",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2016 1500 ml. bottle sampled @ Quintessence 2016. 2011 Vintage. Hazy golden off-white. Nose is classical geuze funk, low fruit but also lots of word, far more than expected. Taste is weird thick lightly moldy oak, lots of oak here, giving it a faint almost vaguely sweet touch, otherwise, lively body, fizzy, regular geuze funk, barn, horse blanket. Good obv, at this point & age, I might prefer the regular one, I didnt get the wow factor that others got, still a very nice good beer. I forgot about it but this very likely Cantillons Bomb Shelter Beer Cellar (see drinkbelgianbeer website for info).","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
355,"2016-05-05",3.0,"Säuerlicher Beginn mit Andeutungen von Kräutern. Insgesamt recht mild bleibend, süffig, vollmundig, dabei aber weniger komplex als gedacht.
