Aromas is full of peaches...brett-funk, hay, light oak and hint of vanilla. Taste is full-on peach jam...light tart note pushes the fruit forward.

1150,"2017-04-29",4.1,"500 ml bottle. Pours a mostly clear copper orange color and topped by a small eggshell head of foam that settles in nicely to a thin film and leaves spotty lacing behind on the glass. The aroma is really nice showing nice sweet and tart peaches some residual sugar sweetness, wild farmhouse yeast, horse blanket, vanilla, and a touch of old oak. Smells very reminiscent of the peach ring candies. The flavor follows with the juicy sweet peach, lactic tartness, barnyard funk from the yeast, leather, vanilla and old oak. Not crazy sour, but some still some lactic tartness to go with the peach sweetness. Medium bodied with ample carbonation and light acidity that leads to a tart and juicy peach finish. Really tasty stuff that I thoroughly enjoyed. Really glad I got to try this one.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

1150,"2016-07-19",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed at Dougs house for the Epic Peach and Apricot debacle of a tasting that happened on July 9. 500 mL bottle. The pour is a reddish brown color with a thin off white head that rests as a film. The aroma is huge peach. Lots of flesh and tart skins. There is a hint of vanilla, but I love this smell. Its not as tart as I would like, but its still fantastic. The flavor is a little more disappointing. There is a light citrus, and then it turns to a sweet peach. There is a lack of bright sour crispness that I would like to see and its mostly sweet. The mouth feel is a little heavier than I would like it to be, but the carbonation really helps. The aftertaste is lightly tart peaches. This falls off of the tongue very fast. Its not as good as I was hoping for, thats for sure.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Bottle: The aroma consists of huge peach...equal parts sweet and tart. Theres some mild vanilla and bourbon, but its all about the peach in the nose. It pours a hazy brownish-orange with a orange tinted off-white head that fades to a thin film outlined by a thicker ring. The flavor starts with a quick dose of citrus before it all turns to heavy peach...slightly more tart the than sweet. There is some mild lemon, vanilla, and oak in the finish...but peach dominates. Its light-medium bodied with somewhat soft carbonation and mouthfeel. Overall, if you like peaches, youll love this beer.

Despite the fact that this gushed so wildly that about four ounces wound up on the floor New Glarus has a world class sour on their hands. Be prepared when you open yours so you do not waste a single drop. What you will find it a tart liquid that tastes like peach Jolly Ranchers, vinegar, and that unique sourness that Dan Carey brings to his fruit lineup.

Aroma / Appearance - An aggressive gusher leaves a huge billowing white head behind once you finally capture some in a glass. The semitransparent peach base sparkles like champagne. Sharp peach is offset by a light sourness typical of the New Glarus fruit sours such as Belgian Red, Strawberry Rhubarb, and others.

Flavor / Palate - Vinegary peach jam spread over plain white bread shocks the senses into paying attention from the very first sip. The immediate transition opens up as it hits the throat. The full bite might develop over a few more months but this does not attempt to be subtle even now. I wish I could have picked up more than two.

This was poured into a tulip. 
The appearance was a nice looking hazy amber to red color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. The lacing was somewhat there but dissipated within about less than a slim minute. 
The smell had a sour to sweet peach to soured apple/maybe pear maybe glossed over orange to mango engrossing aroma. 
The taste encompasses a nice citrus to piney to bitter/sour apple to pear to sweet fruit.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat sharp but still carried its own as far as everything is required.

1150,"2014-08-26",3.9,"500 ml bottle acquired from the GTMW 2014 Releases (New Glarus, WI). Lets do this thing. Pours a deep copper orange hue, decent haziness and lively carbonation through the body. A lovely deep fall fiery glow of peach, orange and copper love. A cakey tannish head atop stays as a firm layer, good stick around and lacing as a firm layer. Nice, pretty, and alluring. Aromas show a medium juicy peach front, lemony and lactic life with touches of oak, bready malts and cobwebs. Firm sourness, a bit tannic with decent funk, vanilla and yogurt. Firm peachy fruit element is juicy, a bit tart with some toasty pit. Nice nose, nothing overpowering but pleasant and juicy, a bit fresh still. Initial is light and fluffy on the palate, nice carbonation meets some firmer oak, lactic and yogurty life. Touches of vanilla mean cream and peaches. Decent fruit elements show citrusy sourness, juicy yet fading peach notes as we move on. More fruity and juicy into the middle, the backend gets a bit more dry and tannic, lighter and quickly fleeting. A touch of peach nectar remains. That front end, nose and appearance really are winners. This beer seems a bit more delicate though with some softened yet sour, dry funky bretty backend. Touches of fruit, vanillin and peach flesh quickly get taken by that funky bretty feel, dry, dusty. Overall, this one seems a bit young. Some bottle time might really sour this up but at the same time also might take away from the really well done nose and front end here, drying it out and making it more acidic. While it isnt quite its previous years brethren, it is a very well crafted sour with good flavors, balance, and an impressive drinkability. A touch slanted towards the fruit and delicacy as opposed to a more aggressive sour and wild element, but itll be interesting to see how this develops.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Light to medium bodied, the flavor offered more pronounced peach, and a more sour nature, with some tannic astringency, and finishing dryness. Very flavorful.

1150,"2014-08-09",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2015 500 ml bottle. I bought this yesterday, opened to share with some friends in the in parking lot on day #2. Dark orange pour. Had a bit of carbonation but not the gusher they warmed it might be. Aroma is intense peach. Flavor has a lot of peach. Its sour, but not crazy. A touch of funk near the end, something I dont remember from other NG sours. In my book sour blackberry and fuzzy are the top 2 sours, this isnt as good as those, but is in the next tier down. However, looking at the early reviews of sour blackberry, it seems it got better, hope that this follows the same. 4.2

1150,"2014-08-08",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2014 500ml bottle, relatively room temp. Gold pour, juicy peach smell, first dirnk is highly metallic, some peach. Antoher few sips in sourness takes effect and leads into some really funky barnyardy oak. Typical NG high class sour.

From a cold bottle: Murky brown pour, lots of carbonation bubbles racing around, quickly dissipating head. Smell is huge peach, just huge. There is a fair amount of woody oak as well, and some spices. Flavor is at first sweetish and metallic, plenty of vinegar as well. Sour tartness creeps in, it really is like drinking liquid sour peach rings, but not sweet and artificial, the real thing. Some tannic and wood notes to round out the complexity. Would love to see this as a 4pk ala the kriek, cranberry, or enigma. Maybe market as a new ""special release"" series for like 13.99 or something.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
