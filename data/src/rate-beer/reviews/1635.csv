1635,"2015-11-30",4.2,"Pours a night black color, with a big, beige head, revealing huge bubbles while slowly collapsing.

Has intense citrus aromas, reminding me more of an ipa than an actual stout. Hops slowly blend into luscious bakers chocolate among a warming roastiness. Due to the rich maltiness, fruity hops invite sappy orange to the aromas.

Has a lower carbonation, leading to a smooth silkness, while the beer drinks very easy in general.

Begins with bitter citrus, which gets a flowery quality added, as earthy malts wrap up the hops. Malts turn more profound then, with a pleasant roasty quality to them, resulting in a dry, bitter chocolate note. Flavors dont turn overly intense at any point, granting the silkness to provide a great softness to the tongue. Finishes with a perfect mix of lemon zest hops, toasted malts and a prominent smoothness, producing a cream coated medium bitterness.

Another perfectly balanced beer by the Kernel, while their love for well a integrated hop profile applies in this one too.","GERMANY","aleigator"
