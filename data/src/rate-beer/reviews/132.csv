132,"2017-05-28",4.5,"Thnx to Eugene for the share ! Pours darker amber/gold, no head, as if anywone would be expecting one, that is. Smell is sticky, intense applesauce, full on natural and complex, minor alcohol notes. Taste is very full bodied, silky applesauce, very intensely so. Sweet, obviously, as well as a sticky MF. Very nice ice cider once again. Booze isnt to high, complexity is there. all factors seem to have great balance. minor warmth at the back of the throat. This is what humankind has been kept alive for !","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

132,"2017-05-26",4.3,"About half of a 187 ml. bottle @ home. Obtained in a trade with AdamChandler. 2014 Vintage. Quite dark dark orange amber apple juice appearance. Nose is sweet golden / red apples, very low alcohol feel to it and some applesauce. Some low clean alcohol, basic sweet but not heavily so by ice cider standards, easy sweet juicy apple, bit dry in the finish, slick, low agave, low cooked apple, mellow syrup, alcohol doesnt distract but it feels boozier than it is, there is low herbal feel & dried apple and half dried apple note. Nice in general but far from the best in the style in my opinion.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
132,"2017-05-01",4.4,"Copper color with little in the way of legs. Intense juicy apple, pear and cinnamon aroma. Heavy palate, but washes clean. Sweetness is strangely all over the tongue on the sip, but doesnt stick around and cloy. Honey, cinnamon, vanilla, clove, and of course huge apple flavor. Acidity is pretty out there to hold off all the sugar and make this balanced. If anything, its lacking a touch of alcohol heat. I poured this chilled and have let it warm. I liked it better cold. The flavors actually seemed to pop more. The sweetness overwhelms a little now. Still great, but better chilled. Pretty solid stuff.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"

132,"2015-09-06",4.0,"How: Sample (1½ oz) at Northern Kingdom Tasting Center.

>>> A pretty good example of how good and ""unique"" an ice cider made with only one apple variety can be. It showcase the honey character from the Honeycrisp apple in a wonderful way.

-  Deep and bright golden-orange color leaving nice legs on the glass. 
-  Flavor profile is quite complex for an ice cider made with only one apple variety. 
-  Caramelized apples and honey sweetness are the two main flavors with mild tropical fruits and mild spiciness completing the profile. 
-  Sweetness level is medium to high for an ice cider. Im surprised by the similarities with honey/mead sweetness. I know Honeycrisp apples have earned that name because of that character but I didnt think it would be that perceptible in an ice cider. 
-  Theres a bright acidity to cut the sweetness and gives this cider a pretty good balance. 
-  Medium to full body. A bit oily. Nice mouth coating honeyed sweetness. 

Flavors:  Caramelized apples, honey, mild tropical fruits, mild spiciness.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
