3049,"2017-01-21",3.9,"Bottle at a tasting - thanks, Kevin! Dat Pappy doe. Hazy dark brown color with a khaki head fading to a ring. Aroma has lots of toffee, bourbon, some booze evident. Sweet toffee and booze flavor, good bourbon notes, decent barrel, touch of oxidation. Full body with higher carbonation. Slightly hot. Really good though.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
3049,"2016-06-16",4.3,"Bottle thanks to Charles. Pours a cloudy brown with small head that diminishes to nothing. The aroma is caramel, candy sugar, wood, bourbon. Thick mouth, chewy, caramel, burnt sugar, bourbon, wood, vanilla, nice sweetness, really impressive.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3049,"2016-06-10",4.8,"From notes. Enjoyed this one at the Brew Crew Bash in Ann Arbor on May 21. This one was poured from a 22 oz bottle. Thanks Rudi! I had written this one off that Id never get to try it, but here it is. The pour looks like magic. Its a lighter brown, with hints of garnet shining through and a light khaki colored ring of head that just settles in, leaving a couple spots of lace. The aroma is killer. There is such an explosion of dark fruits and sweet caramel and chocolate malts. I love it. The bourbon is lightly present, but the woodiness and vanilla thats imparted into the beer are phenomenal. Its sweet, complex, and deep. This is just going to be great. The flavor will give you a chub. There is a deep dark fruitiness right up front that works through a caramel and chocolate sweetness. The bourbon and barrel characters add to the depth and the light vanilla and sweet malt on the back end are killer. This is liquid magic. The balance is just perfect. The mouth feel is thick and heavy with a soft carbonation that just lingers forever. The aftertaste is sweet malts, chocolate, vanilla, and a hint of dark fruits with a lovely smooth bourbon heat that comes around. Holy shit am I glad I got to try this one!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3049,"2016-01-04",4.1,"Pours a dark chocolate brown color with subtle purplish hues and dark mahogany edges. Half finger light beige head that quickly settles into a thin, lasting ring. Spotty lacing left behind.

Very inviting aroma with excellent barrel character thats nicely integrated into the leathery malts and vinous fruits of the base beer. Some softly charred oak, spicy spirit(with actuall pappy character), toasted coconut and silky vanilla bean. Underneath, theres a nice balance of vinous fruit and softly smoked leathery/tobacco-like malts. Hints of caramel drizzled raisin, date and fig along with toffee, tobacco and musty leather. Smells amazing!

Viscous full body with prominent barrel flavors nicely integrated into the Barleywine notes of the base. Dry toasted oak but not too powerful or acrid. Heavy dose of sweet, spicy spirit that actually has complex whiskey character. Great fiery heat but not harsh or overly boozy with cinnamon and toasted coconut on the exhale. The vinous fruit and malt sweetness isnt as stong as in the aroma but is still there with caramel, raisin, fig and molasses. Subtle leathery tobacco but the earthy Barleywine flavors are slightly overpowered by all the spirit. Another solid entry in this series from Voodoo.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
3049,"2015-07-02",3.9,"Bottle. Brown pour with no head. Sweet, bourbon, oak and sweet aromasz flavors are bourbon, oak, spice and chocolate tones.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
3049,"2015-03-14",3.6,"Bottle, generously shared. Pours like cloudy red rocks muddy water, not the prettiest but not terrible looking. Aroma is rum, raisin, toffee, prunes, soft port, rich buttery caramel, and of course bourbon. Taste is spicy bourbon and wood with roasted raisins and red grape skins. Slightly harsh finish, somewhat thin body. Good but not a showstopper for me.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","dfroms"
3049,"2015-01-22",3.7,"Bottle... Cloudy burnt-caramel pour with no head. The aroma is a malty swirl of huge vanilla and Goetze Caramel Creams ®. Full-bodied with a skim-milk mouthfeel and tickling carbonation. The flavor is purely caramel and bourbon. Rich and savory, but the alcohol is overbearing and astringent. Hot, boozy, sugary finish that, remarkably, dries out a good bit. Bottle generously shared by landhoney!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3049,"2014-12-06",4.8,"Bottle, age has done this well. Soo smooth but tons of taste. The bourbon is really nice. Very complex. Lots of raisin taste. Just fills your taste buds with great flavours. Great stuff.","Ontario, CANADA","Ontbeertaster"
3049,"2014-10-25",4.3,"Bottle at Astoria share. Pours amber brown. Nose/taste of whiskey, oak, dark fruit, apple and caramel bread and toffee. Full bodied.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
3049,"2014-09-02",3.8,"Murky brown pour with a small head. Vanilla, bourbon, Toffee in the aroma. Barrel nicely integrated here, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, dried fruit, slightly leathery. Medium body, lower carb.","","Johnsense"
3049,"2014-09-01",3.6,"One year aged. Brown good carmel and bourbon. Big abv but not boozy. Smooth.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
3049,"2014-07-14",4.2,"Served on-tap at Perch Pub during the Voodoo/Perennial event during Philly Beer Week.


A - Pours murky deep brown with a small film of white head, quickly dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lace at all on the glass.


S - Smells of brown sugar, smooth bourbon, toffee, caramel, oak, chocolate and toasted nutty grain. You can tell its going to be a little sweet but the ever present smooth bourbon really does an amazing job smoothing it all out.


T - Starts off with a large sugary sweet kick - mainly the toffee, brown sugar, caramel and chocolate - slowly being joined by the oak, toasted nuts and dark fruits. Finish is still sweet with some dryness from the booze, lingering long after the finish.


M - Medium body with moderate to low carbonation. Smooth, sweet feel is pretty amazing considering how much is going on with this one. As it warms the booze gets a little strong.


O - One of the better BA barleywines I have had. The flavors all work amazingly well together and despite the size it is pretty easy to consume. Worth the long lines but I still wouldnt give up all of my beer for it like some people have been doing.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
3049,"2014-06-21",4.1,"Woodshed 3.0! Big thanks to dak for saving this whole series and sharing with us. Awesome!! Bottle pours with a clear copper body that supports a tan head of foam. The aroma offers up booze, sugary apricot and peach and plum pieces and then rolling into more booze and light bourbon barrel notes. The taste is boozy and quickly picks up vanilla and fairly smooth bourbon notes. To midway the sweet fruity esters come forward that are somewhat apricot and plum and nectarine like. Overall the barrel treatment and the sweet esters create a nice balance. Solid.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
3049,"2014-06-15",4.1,"Darker brown pour, tan head. Great bourbon notes, brown sugar, prunes, caramel, toasted oak, sweet and bourbon goodness. Really nice but not quite up to the hype.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
3049,"2014-06-08",4.2,"Shared @ Woodshed 3.0! Dak is Kaiser Soze...truly believe this! Nobody else could acquire this bottle. Loads of caramel, toffee, maple, molasses, and vanilla accompanied by spicy bourbon, floral notes, and a hint of alcohol. Absolutely a great beer but the flavors and aroma dont blend as well as others in the style. An amazing brew but just misses world-class.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
3049,"2014-06-03",4.4,"On tap at perch, pours reddish brown with small head. Smell is amazing...rich rich fucking barrels and caramel corn complexity. Taste is dark fruits, pappy van wink, malt, caramel, honey and whiskey fire but not overwhelming. Amazing stuff...maybe a bit too warming but the pappy barrels imparted some serious awesomeness.

3049,"2014-02-22",3.9,"Bottle at Bunny's son's 1st birthday party (after). Aroma and flavor of tons of Pappy bourbon. This one was hot. Really had an odd nose, spiked caramel? Idk. Everything else about this was spectacular. Excellent beer.","California, USA","timfoolery"
3049,"2014-02-18",3.8,"Bottle #139 shared by Seth. Amber pour with a white head. Sweet caramel malt aromas. Bourbon heat overwhelms the sweet caramel malt and dark fruit notes. Brown sugar lowlights. Average body and mouthfeel. Didnt quite live up to the hype.","Florida, USA","50belair"

3049,"2014-02-04",4.0,"Pour is dark cherry brown, strong haze with a tight bubbly tan head. Nose is large, strong roasted wood notes and bourbon. Lots of chocolate notes with some brown sugar and a touch of berry sweetness. Taste follows suit, tons of roasted wood and clean bourbon notes.

3049,"2014-01-02",4.5,"Bottle from the release, poured into a barrel room snifter. Pours a dark brew that looks a little caramel with a good amount of light put to it. Smell is intoxicating, lots of dark figgy fruits, good amount of barrel in the nose. Just awesome. Taste follows the nose in dark whiskey soaked fruits, vanilla, Oakey barrel on this also. Another great beer from voodoo.","york haven, Pennsylvania, USA","jra1983"

3049,"2013-11-23",4.4,"Poured from bottle into tulip. Pours murky brown with almost no head. Aroma is loads of bourbon and toffee. Taste follows the nose with lots of good rye and bourbon notes and some nice sweetness. Really fantastic beer.","Alpine, California, USA","hamilton23"
3049,"2013-11-03",4.2,"Pours hazy and dark amber in color. The head is soft and dissipates to leave a ring of foam that hugs my glass. The aroma blends the medium levels of pappy van winkle bourbon, oak, and defined sweet carmel malts. It is very much booze driven. In the flavor I noticed sweet bourbon, oak, high levels of sweet carmel malts, molasses, and a buttery toffee like character. Overall the beverage is drinkable and pleasant. The finish is kind and very kind to the palate considering the intensity of this beverage. This one is a treat to have and share.","Steubenville, Ohio, USA","Advocate_Ames"
