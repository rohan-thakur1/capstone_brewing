1792,"2017-06-02",3.4,"Pullo @ Alko. Kaatuu snifteriin sysimustana, paksuna ja noin sormen paksuisella tummalla vaahdolla. Tuoksussa tuntuu Öön lakritsisuus ja soijakastikemaisuus lievän kahvisen paahdon kanssa. Lisänä perusversioon konjakkitynnyri tuntuu selvästi: hieman alkoholia, tammea ja ylikypsää hedelmää. Pehmeyttä saisi olla enemmän, tällaisenaan on turhan kovaa ja hyökkäävää. Maussa lakritsi ja soimaisuus tulevat heti alkumaussa, mutta pian tammisuus ja konjakkimainen ylikypsä hedelmäisyys valtaavat alaa. Pohjana olevassa oluessakin on hiven luumuisuutta mukana, kypsytyksen tuoma hedelmäisyys on enemmänkin hieman käynyttä hedelmäisyyttä. Suutuntuma on alkuun paksu, mutta tynnyröinnin makujen tuoma alkoholisuus terävöittää ja ohentaa tuntumaa aika lailla. Alkuun makea, mutta loppun kuivempi. Kokonaisuutena konjakin aromit on saatu hyvin mukaan, mutta ne tekevät tästä oluesta turhan hyökkäävän ja alkoholisen omaan makuuni. Mainio perusversio on huomattavasti parempi.","FINLAND","fantti"

1792,"2017-05-26",4.5,"Bottle shared by Jan, big cheers for this top notch, barrel aged Baltic porter from the country most associated with it (although more internationally renowned classic examples come from other countries like Poland, Finland and even Sweden, but anyway). Creamy, pale yellowish beige, stable, closed, frothy head lacing in dots, over a black beer with a thin, ruddy mahogany edge. Lovely, distinguished and rich bouquet of black cherry juice, elderberries, tawny port, rum-soaked raisins, chocolate bars, marmelade, plum brandy and indeed cognac, vanilla, toast, beef stock cubes, kahlua. Candied fig and black cherry sweetness in the onset, surrounded by a cured meat-like umami flavor and some underlying, dim sourishness, soft carbo, oily and viscous but very supple mouthfeel - the typical mouthfeel for a Baltic porter, Id say. Lovely nutty and chocolatey malts with both sweeter toffeeish and bitterish toasted (and eventually bitter black chocolate) aspects fill the mouth cavity, becore a spicy hop touch and a supple, vaguely vanilla-ish oakiness provide dryness alongside a glowing alcohol warmth in which the sweetish, noble flavor of cognac is unmistakable. This Estonian craft brewer has produced a whole series of wonderful Baltic porters - I have argued here before that if any craft brewery should lift this old and often neglected style up to new 21st-century heights, it should be this one, and that is exactly what they did here: this is a masterpiece of international allure, a welcome diversion from the overload of barrel aged imperial stouts, with the cleanness, suppleness and roundness expected from the style, but coupled with a lovely cognac barrel depth. Absolutely stunning.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

1792,"2016-09-25",3.9,"Bottle, with a ridicilously thick layer of wax. Took some minutes to cut through it. Black pour. Aroma of cognac, booze, red fruit, smooth choco and roast. Taste has soft licorice, booze, some cognac, malt, choco and red fruit. The barrel is a bit faint, but adds a nice layer of fruity boozyness.","NETHERLANDS","MarcoDL"

1792,"2016-09-20",4.0,"12oz bottle at DrinkBaar in Tallinn pours a thick, viscous black with a ring of tan head. Nose has a lot of molasses and licorice, some booze, a little tar, more grappa to me than cognac, dark dried fruits too. Flavor is very well balanced, obviously plenty of malt and molasses sweetness, some toasty/roasty notes too, thick coffee, booze, some wood, caramel, dried fruits. Full bodied, sticky finish but quite smooth too.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
1792,"2016-09-18",4.1,"Tap beer. OO XO è un imperial stout ben fatta. Colore nero, schiuma ridotta, Aroma di caffè, di malti tostati. Al gusto sorprende il sapore di olive nere in salamoia che la caratterizzano accanto all evidente sapore di caffè dei malti tostati. Il retrogusto è pieno e non stucchevole perché il sapore della salamoia la rende decisamente più armoniosa al palato ed interessante. Rompe lo schema delle solite banali imperial stout proiettandoti in una nuova dimensione. Decisamente da provare.","","Robeperse"

Taste: smooth, medium sweet, coffee, dark chocolate, warming cognac in the backgound,some woodiness. Full body. Nicely balanced and well hidden alcohol. bitter chocolate finish. TReally nice, lets see what the cellar is doing with that.","Tartu, ESTONIA","VamboladeTolly"
1792,"2016-09-16",3.8,"Vanilla and cognac in aroma, also some alcohol but not enough to bother. Nice pitch black colour. Taste is rather strong and bitter, coffee like, but aftertaste is very pleasant and smooth. I would definately consider this as wine replacement.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Aresh"
1792,"2016-09-16",3.9,"Tap. Pitch black color. Small size, brown head, stays. Sweet, caramel, bit of plastic, rye, cognac, alcohol, woody and oily in aroma. Roast, smooth, cognac, woody, alcohol, faint tingle of hops in taste. Smooth roast and caramelly cognac in aftertaste. Bit oily mouthfeel. Surprisingly not as heavy body as I expected. Goes down very easy. I am a bit of the fan of cognac (and beer too!). And 2 of my favorite drinks blend in this nicely. It is bit of alcoholic, but absolutely doesnt disturb me. Super drinkable brew.","Reval, ESTONIA","Marduk"
1792,"2016-09-16",3.9,"Had it on tap without taking notes, this is from memory. Just shy of black with thick but smallish tan head. Aroma and flavour surprisingly mellow, the cognac is definitely there but rather subdued and pleasantly integrated with the sweet and roasty overall character. The cognac gets a bit sharp only in every 5th sniff or so, and as it goes down, there is a slight burning alcoholic sensation which I dont mind at all considering its 11.5%. Really soft and velety in the mouth, carbonation thin and moderate. A very good brew, a bit too safe perhaps. Will re-review when (if?) I get a chance to try a bottled version.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"
1792,"2016-09-15",3.8,"from bottle, poured black with a tanned head. nose of sweet chocolate, light roast, lots of dark fruits, plums, dark berries, vanilla oak, brown sugar, and intense sweetness of cognac. taste of sweet chocolate, roast, and dried prunes, sweet cognac heat finish.","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
1792,"2016-09-14",4.1,"On tap at Speakeasy. Dark browne colour. Thin beige round of froth on top. Chocolate, cocoa, creamy notes, hints of berries, hints of cognac, very slight notes of alcochol in the aroma. Chocolaty, bit alcocholy notes. Hints of berries. Dark fruits, cocoa. Sourness, hints of cognac again. Slightly alcocholy, chocolaty aftertaste. Rather heavy bodied, very well balanced, really enjoyable brew.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Rask0lnikov"
1792,"2016-09-14",3.6,"Tap (Speakeasy, Tallinn)
Black, tan head. Initially quite a sharp aroma, but the spike mellows, and leaves a pleasantly rich roast. Palate full, but not too heavy, pleasantly lifted by the gentle carbonation. Taste is a slightly hot woody burnt roast, alcohol not hidden. Finish tingles with bitterness and keeps reminding you of the warming alcohol. Definitely good, but not particularly grabbing me. Well, Ill grab a bottle too, and see if that excites me more. In its favour, its not sticky or sweet, and the alcohol isnt so hot it assaults the nose.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
1792,"2016-09-14",4.1,"On tap at Speakeasy, Tallinn. Very dark brown with a very modest beige head. Looks like used motor oil, but smells much better. Roasty aroma with fairly heavy barrel influence; notes of cognac and oak well mixed with the malty and roasty flavours. Dark chocolate, dark fruits and hints of coffee. Mixture of cognac and chocolate makes me think of different sorts of liqueur filled chocolate. Its certainly desserty, but also rather delicious, but still a fairly small glass of this would be more fitting (typical fortified wine kind of glass or at least a fairly small wine glass). Surprisingly smooth and mildly warming with alcohol well integrated. Certainly a nice one!","Tallinn, ESTONIA","visionthing"
1792,"2016-09-14",3.6,"Tap. Dark brown to black beer, small tan head. Nose is roasty, boozy, sweet, chocolate, dried fruit motes. Flavor is sweet, chocolate notes mixed with cocoa dust, middle of the flavor is dominated by booze, but not in a bad way, also a ton of sweetness. Boozy and roasty bitterness in the finish. Lingering alcohol, roasty retronasals. Sweet and boozy beer with a pretty smooth palate. Cognac comes off more as added alcohol. Dont know if Id want a whole bottle of this.","ESTONIA","suurjuust"
1792,"2016-09-14",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2016 Tap at speakeasy. Pours black with brownish head. Aroma is sweet, roast, malt, cognac, metallic. Flavor is sweet and bitter, roast, malt, sugar, some fruits, some metallic notes (disappear as it warms up), cognac, some soy. Finish is sweet and roast-cognac bitter with some alcohol. Feels potent, but drinkability is good for the abv. Overall: great brew (sweet and boozy), works better as smaller sample.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","martjoobolut"
