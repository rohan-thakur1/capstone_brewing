Flavor is just wonderful. Moderate bourbon throughout the sip, vanilla, brownie batter hints. The sip ends on toffee and some oak. Honestly, every time I take a sip I get a combination of different flavors. The complexity of this is high. The alcohol is damn near completely hidden. This one will sneak up on you.

Arômes de caramel, dun alcool qui ne me déplaît pas, de canne à sucre, de rhum, de barley wine. Cest en effet cette composante qui lemporte sur le stout, malgré sa forte teneur en Parabole, ce stout de renommée mondiale. Un orge cru, craquant, riche, étincelant. Cest plein de vie et de sagesse. En bouche je note des arômes de caramel, de crème brûlée, de bois vanillé, le tout enrobé dans un alcool puissant du Sud.

Opaque very dark brown color, medium sized light brown head that lasts for a decent while. Aroma is malts, caramel, chocolate, oak, wood, bourbon, brandy, ripe dark fruits, brandy or rum soaked raisins, vanilla. Holy shit this is heavy and incredibly complex! Taste malts, chocolate, a little less vanilla fortunately as I dont like a beer to have too much vanilla, lots of liquor: bourbon, brandy, wood, sweetness from the barrel as well as bitterness, a medium to firm alcohol burn in the finish. Raisins, overripe dark fruits, bourbon and brandy soaked dark fruits. Full body, medium to full carbonation (at least thats what the mouthfeel is like probably due to the alcohol burn).

Why not leave it at that, leave the rest of it in the bottle and cuddle your wife in bed? -Well, shes asleep already so whats the point?- Come on, she loves when you come to bed in time and cuddle for a bit. -But the fire isnt done yet.- Screw the fire! Itll die out eventually. Finish your glass and go to bed. -But theres a bunch of cheese that I bought which hasnt been eaten yet!- Screw the cheese, think of your wife. -I am thinking of her, shes asleep very sound, so why should I leave the fire and beer and potentially wake her up?- She wants you to be there with her, dont you get it? -Not really, I tried to show some affection earlier but she pushed me away because shes having her period!- Are you sure dude? -Wait what are you implying?- Cant you see? Youre always there on your own, ticking beers by the fire place. -Yeah, so? She doesnt like staying up late and she doesnt care about a nice fire.

Taste is sweet, bitter, malty and slightly boozy. Mouthfeel is viscous, creamy, round, tiny cloying, slightly astringent, boozy and near full bodied. Finish is sweet and bitter with caramel/toffee/vanilla fudge malts, assorted caramelized nuts and plenty of peppery bourbon barrel booze.

2658,"2016-03-14",4.4,"Bottle at Row 34, Portsmouth, NH. In the world of beer I love, Firestone Walkers barrel aged stuff is right up at the top, so I was very excited for this one and it did not disappoint. One of the most complex beers Ive ever tasted -- the beers that went into this blending are all noticeable, although the Parabola dominates a little. Strong tastes of chocolate and a bit of roasted coffee give way to malt sweetness and ripe fruit taste, before it all finishes with booze. A lot of booze. Itll be interesting to see how this matures, but at 3 months old its an orgy of flavor -- lots of chocolate and malt, lots of booze, and oh-so-enjoyable.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

2658,"2016-02-27",4.3,"From notes. 22 oz bottle shared by Doug at his house on February 22. The pour is a light black, a little thin, with a thin beige head that disappears very quickly, leaving a couple spots of lace as it falls to a thin collar. The aroma is heavily boozy. This reminds me of Parabola, which is a whiskey bomb. There is a little bit of oak in there and a light chocolate. There is a hint of molasses and a hint of licorice. Its not too bad, but I cant really get over the booziness. The flavors are very similar. There is a heavy whiskey up front and a bright woody char There is a nice caramel and a little sweet malt that blends with the molasses and chocolate nicely. On the bitter front, there is a hint of the licorice that remains present just like in the nose. The mouth feel is excellent. Its thick and viscous with a soft carbonation and a beautiful lingeringly boozy chocolate finish. I was skeptical on this one at first, but it really pulled together and turned into an excellent beer. This one definitely isnt as complex as XVIII, but I look forward to the next one!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
2658,"2016-02-20",4.6,"Rating #2100. When in doubt for a milestone, go with a Firestone Walker Anniversary beer, thats my motto. Boxed bomber. Right after the first pour the aroma contains some astringent bourbon and oak. The astringency dissipates almost immediately, leaving coconut, toffee, chocolate, licorice, molasses, soy sauce--typical for this series, but thats never a bad thing. Pours dark dark brown to nearly black with a quickly collapsing beige head. Taste is sweet and savory with all those aroma deScriptors, along with some tobacco, leather; alcohol is strong, but its not boozy. Oily mouthfeel, full body. Super good, but maybe not as good as 14 or 16. Seems like a safe blend for the series. Very conservative. I expect the 20th Anniversary edition to be opposite of conservative. At least, I hope so.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"

2658,"2016-01-25",4.5,"22 oz bottle purchased at RJs Wine and Spirits a few months ago. Deep reddish-brown appearance with a small tan head, fully dissipating.

2658,"2016-01-19",3.7,"Bottle pours with a clear mahogany colored body that supports a wafer thin light tan head. The modest aroma offers up roasted malts, molasses, some brown sugar, bourbon like booze, chocolate more booze and some oak. The taste delivers similar notes such as molasses, molasses nuanced vanilla and smooth bourbon. It picks up sticky sweet oak and booze midway and into the finish. Pretty nice but it lacks the depth and character of a few of the other years. Maybe a year on the shelf will pull it together.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

2658,"2015-11-21",3.5,"Bottle (22 oz) shared at tasting by Julien Huxley, thanks! Reddish brown with a small bubbly brown head leaving little legs on the glass. Unsurprisingly, the aroma is rather boozy and combine loads of bourbon/vanilla features to toasted malts, roasted malts, toffee, caramel and dried fruits... its super rich but theres borderline too much going on... and the line is crossed with the taste wheres its too much for me. Bourbon, sweetness, vanilla, toffee, dried fruits, some straight-up boozy notes, roasted malts, toasted notes and all the usual suspects. While theres a ton going on, I wouldnt say its ""multi-layered"" as its a bit messy. Full body. Soft to moderate carbonation. Oily and rather thick mouthfeel. Hot and fruity finish. While I rather enjoyed my small sample, I already had more than enough. I think that good big bold beer can be ""drinkable"" - at least in small quantity, this isnt the case here. Not bad, but definitely not I would seek again especially considering the price.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
