Poured out clear mahogany. 25ºSRM.

Nose has molasses and brown sugar aromas. There are nice strong dried date aromas as well. The tang of alcohol gives this a nose like a nice scotch ale but with less smokiness. You also get some sweet maraschino cherry aroma.

Mouthfeel is syrupy. Palate has strong honey and treacle flavor notes. There is banana but also a very nice rich creamy bread pudding-like flavor which makes this overall like having a very moist and alcoholic banana bread. There are rum-like flavors as well. The finish is alcoholic with a nectary, raw brown sugar like base but with some nice spiciness which is accentuated by the curmudgeonly alcoholic burn: cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and maybe even some five spice. There is also this cloud of creamy aromas and flavors with vanilla bean, creme fraiche, and sweet cream.

Aroma is aboud with toffee & tobacco. Its got some mild oak & a little bit of cherry, maybe some clavados. Mildly oxidized at this point but the light sherry like character fits pretty well here. 

The flavor is toffee forward with a little bit of pear and cherry. Its still got some oak character but thats melded into the flavor of the beer well at this age whereas it can be a bit brash when the beer is fresh. Its certianly sweet but not cloying and has some nice plum , chocolte, & raisin flavor... The booziness is nicely warming and its not much in the way of papery oxidation.

Palate is more maple syrup than mollasses with a candied like sweetness. Strangely I dont pick up the oak or molasses independently but notice there combination delievers what I would describe as a bourbon like character.

3666,"2015-06-05",2.3,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2015 12 oz bottle, poured into an oversized wine glass at ~45 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a mostly clear ruddy amber, and forms almost no head. What does form vanishes completely in short order, in a puff of fizzing.

Smell: The aroma is subtle, barely there, likely due to the wide-mouth glass. It is mild caramel and sweetness, with very soft hints of oak.

Taste: And alas, my hop sensitivity strikes. This has an earthy, ashy bitterness to it which becomes virtually all I can taste. I can faintly, oh so very faintly, make out wispy ghosts of sweet caramel beneath the dirty ashes, but thats it.

Mouthfeel: Acrid and harsh are the only things I can describe this as, like most beers that trip my hop sensitivity trigger.

Overall: This is a beer Id cite as an example of where ""old ale"" and ""English barleywine"" are not necessarily synonyms - Ive run into fewer English barleywines that I can barely drink than old ales. This may very well be a tasty beer, but its one I cant enjoy.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Initial, bright aromas of sweet toffee with a floral and herbal note come through with a woody and vanilla supporting note. Secondary notes of sugary maple syrup / molasses also appear with some sweet citrus and berries, as well as a light, hidden alcohol undertone. It pours a hazy / murky orange bronze topped by an active, off-white soapy, uneven head that retains a thin ring and small splotch surface as well as a light, spotty lace. The taste is a medium high, malty sweet and complimentary medium waxy bitter. The beer is full bodied, malty, with a thick and sticky texture thanks to a near flat, light fuzz carbonation. Flavors of toffee, citrus, and vanilla are most noticeable with a finish that?s crisp, and fairly clean, with woody spice character and a light alcohol warmth. The aftertaste is a waxy citrus rind and herbal blend. It?s a sneaky alcohol content in that there?s only a faint hint on the nose, but it?s well hidden on the palate. It?s rather malty fresh, so it?ll be curious to see how age treats it. 4/201512/2015 - Initial leather aromas fade, replaced by intense toffee and raisin, then molasses and mild nuts and wood.

Pours a beautiful translucent, somewhat cloudy, coppery orange with a small light beige head, leaving some lacing and sticking around the edge. Nose... beeeaaaautiful, makes me twitch in excitement. Its got a strong whiskey-like oaky and peaty character combined with ""raw"" caramel, but also more delicate sweet aspects like vanilla, and tart red berries, indistinct spicy hops and some warmth coming from the alcohol. I honestly would just like to sniff this the whole night and then not show up at work tomorrow. Taste... equally mesmerising... Sweet like some plum wine, dark dried fruits there definitely, caramel too, raisins, alcohol, but also grainy malts in the background. Good bitterness giving it an extra kick.

Body relatively light, palate smooth and slippery, maybe even too much so for 10% - makes it kinda dangerous I think. Carbonation modest. Finishes with intense resinous bitterness amplified by alcohol, and somewhat balanced out by its raisiny sweetness.

 Served on tap in a snifter

 Appearance  The beer is served a clear deep golden amber color with a small thick looking white head. The head fades rather slowly leaving a decent level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is of a sweet caramel and a decent level of a bready smell. Along with these aromas are some notes of darker fruits with some raisin and prune as well as some other sweet smells of toffee and molasses. Along with these smells are some oak and booze which combined with the rest to produce a sweet, warming and malty aroma overall. 

 Taste  The taste begins with a rather sweet and smooth taste. The taste is largest of a smooth bready and caramel flavor with hints of light roasted and dark fruits within. The roastiness get slightly stronger as the taste advances with the darker fruits of raisin and plum getting stronger as the taste advances as well. Some more boozy flavors start to work their way in more toward the middle of the taste with some nice molasses sweetness coming to the tongue as well. With the booze and the sweeter flavors that come to the tongue more toward the middle, and a little bit of an oaky, rum like flavor, that comes to the tongue at the end, one is left with a nice smooth and sweet warming flavor to be left on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel For a brew of almost 10 % abv it is very drinkable yet appropriate in style. The body of the beer is on the thicker side rather nicely accentuating all the sweet and malty flavors of the beer while the carbonation of the brew is on the lower side, which allows all the oaky, sweet, and malty flavors tons of time to linger on the tongue.

 Overall  A very enjoyable sweet and malty brew. Just what an old ale should be.","","Darkmagus82"

Has an oily, spicy maltiness to it, with vanilla and cream underneath, which defines the character of this brew.

Sultana raisins, caramel, dried apple, light buttery oak notes, and light butterscotch. Full bodied and sweet, with woody notes, a light floral note, noticeable medium bitterness, caramel, and raisin up front followed by some more pronounced metallic hopping, dried fruit, and lingering woody notes in the finish. Not picking up much in the way of molasses though. Very much comes across as a barley wine, and a good one at that. Well balanced with no one flavour taking over the spectrum.

Im getting ahead of myself, though. The body is amber-brown and the head is impressive for such a high ABV. Aroma is malty rich, boozy, and has touches of oak - very much like a Barleywine, which makes sense. Flavor has dark fruits (raisin, plumb, black berries) and sweetness (brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, maple syrup, caramel).

This was poured into a snifter. 
The appearance was a nice hazy amber color with just a film of lacing that quickly died and left a bubbliness of sorts along the sides of the glass. 
The smell has a really nice oaky bourbon aroma letting in some light vanilla to entangle itself throughout. There was some light cherries at the end. 
The taste was sweet and had a touch of hot from the strength of the beer. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with not much of a sessionability about it. I sipped it for the most part. The carbonation was super smooth almost as if it wasnt there at all, but I could tell it was slightly there. 
Overall, I could be wrong but the last time I had something from Founders, I thought they would stamp the bottle with a born on date in green. There was no date to be found. Honestly, Im not too worried but think I may have gotten an older bottle due to the slight lack of strength of the booze and the subdued carbonation.

3666,"2014-07-15",4.5,"BOD 4/13/13. Pours a deep amber with a heavy deep dark ruby hue. Weak head and lacing due to the alcohol content. Heavy nose of dark malt (caramel), molasses and dark fruit sweetness over alcohol with bourbon and oak notes. Light carbonation. Almost full bodied with a nice smooth creamy texture. The complex flavor profile is well balanced. It begins with sweet dark fruit flavors (fig, plum and raisin) which flow into a significant bourbon element. As the bourbon fades, oak and vanilla present themselves over a molasses note. The finish is smooth and leaves you with a light alcohol burn and a touch of hops. This is the Olde Ale standard, IMHO.

BOD 4/13/12. Similar head, but hazy with flocculants. The nose is similar, but quite subdued. Bourbon is the most prevalent while the dark fruits have receded. Same body and carbonation. Like the nose, flavors have also gone downhill. Age has decomplexed the flavor profile. While still outstanding, it just doesnt reach out and grab you. Everything is there, but in a subdued fashion and more of a blended presentation rather than a progression on the palate.

Deep caramel amber with a thin, 0.5cm foamy head thats slightly off-white with okay retention given the abv. of the beer. It sits as a fine lacing just about covering the surface & theres some sediment at the bottom of the glass.

Fresh bottle which makes a huge difference as the result of an aging experiment. 

Boozy. Earthy. Molases sweetness. Like dates. Or raisins. 

Looks amazing. Pours like a red orange. Nice head. 

Taste is sweet. Some dates. Like earthy. Almost like a tartness. Like a good barley wine. (Unlike a bwine this does not get better with age) its got booziness but its smooth. Yeah man. 

Palate is smooth. I mean its perfect. Full bodied but still sort of lighter. I mean... And this is why I love founders.... This huge beer is a favorite of my newbie craft beer lover who only likes light beer. (Ironically same with devil dancer)


This is one of my favorite beers. Its a big beer that you can drink on a weeknight. Super potent and flavorful but easygoing enough. The beer by which other old ales are judged.

Color is a dark amber / copper. I had thought an old ale should be slightly darker, and I think a little darker color would add to this by adding a sort of old, woody, seafarer sense to the beer.

Oak, molasses, and malt blend well. Its nice to get a unique flavor that can be a little subtle.

Good beer all around, and nice to have as a change of pace, but if I were looking for the malty, caramel-ly flavor in this beer, Id probably go for a Dirty Bastard.

3666,"2014-04-18",3.4,"The aroma is hard to place - sort of like a scotch ale with its maltiness, but a little more spicy. Pours a great amber color with a surprisingly large off white head that takes a while to dissipate. The taste is malty but not sweet, instead bitter with some boozy undertones. Very drinkable for 9.8% ABV. Call me crazy, but I found it to taste like an imperial IPA crossed with a coffee stout. I dont always like oak aging, but it really comes across nicely in this one, enhancing the aftertaste considerably. The palate was slick with a bitter and slightly oaky finish that lasts until your next sip. I was reluctant to try this because it says it is similar to a barleywine, which I am not a fan of.

Appearance: Pours a ""quiet"" red/orange color with a nice off-white head and lacing at the start.

Smell: Wow. Dark fruits, barrel, molasses sweetness, oak... just as I expected from the label and style. Theres also a slight hint of booze as well.

Taste/feel: Just looking at it in the glass, it looks sweet. Thats probably just because I know theres molasses in it though. This beer is sweetsweetsweet, which you should figure if you know the style, see that this beer is brewed with molasses, or see that the IBUs are ""only"" 50 IBUs. Molasses, candied dark fruits, oak, rich and heavy caramel malts with a bit of a toasted malt aftertaste with an underlying subtle bitterness to keep it from being sickly sweet. Just looking at it in the glass should give you an idea of how it feels. Very mild carbonation with a pretty full body. Some would call it ""flat"", but its a mild carbonation that Im liking for this beer. Also, the body is big, but its not to the point where its syrupy/cloying. Then again, the nice depth of flavor also helps that. Dont get me wrong, it IS a very sweet beer, but its not a chore to drink by any means. 9.8% is hidden perfectly as well.

Overall, an incredibly tasty choice for those who dig a big, bold, malty, sweet beer. It may not be something that Id personally drink very often (Im already a ""ticker"" as it is...), but there is absolutely no denying that this is a phenomenal beer that warrants a try to any beer aficionado.

The flavor is just as complex. There is again, that big malt note on the front end. The molasses offers a great thickness and sweet flavor. The toffee fades through a little bit of an oak before the little bit of an alcohol burn sets in. The mouth feel is a touch thin, but the aftertaste is great.

Palate: Medium to big body with soft carbonation and oily silky texture.
Overall: Very soft and drinkable. Sweet but not cloying. The barrel aging is delicate. I found it a bit tame. Maybe it should have been either older or younger. I was missing some bitterness. Edit 2015-10-17: Felt more of a chocolate character to it this time.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","Mad_Ferret"

Aroma is 100% soupy, taffy malt. 

The taste is nutty chocolate, mocha and a dusty molasses. The malt is sugary. Earthy basement flavors bring up the rear.

Its halfway between a barleywine and a chocolate stout. Best sipped slowly, at room temp, from a snifter. Considering its a Founders, there is a distinct lack of hops. Its intense, and gives a quick buzz, but its not their most complex or their best.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

3666,"2014-01-23",3.8,"12oz bottle. The pour was a murky caramel brown with a slight reddish hue and an average (1-2 fingers) off white creamy head that was mostly lasting, reducing to a puddled film and medium collar with excellent sheets of sticky lacing.

The aroma was of a toasted biscuit malt and a sweet doughy yeast with notes of caramel, toffee, molasses, vanilla, dark fruit (raisons & cherries), oak cask and a little above mild scent of alcohol.

The taste was malty sweet with a decent touch of caramel and toffee early on, and then progressed with a mild yeast presence, a touch of molasses, a light fruitiness, a hint of oak with a sweet alcohol finish. The flavor lasted an average duration after the swallow, with the malty sweetness and a slight alcohol warming left to linger on the taste buds a bit longer.

Mouthfeel was medium in body and syrupy in texture with a nice soft carbonation.

3666,"2013-10-07",4.3,"From 12oz bottle which was bottled on 2/15/13. This ""version"" was ""Brewed with Molasses and Oak Aged."" It pours a deep, slightly cloudy reddish amber color with a very thin tan head which rapidly dissipates to a thin ring. No noticeable lacing. Low to medium carbonation and the head is comprised of very dense bubbles. Mouthfeel is slick and slightly creamy. Very nice. The aroma a sumptuous portent of the awesome taste which is to follow. Primarily the nose follows the taste except there is no detectible hop aroma. Taste is moderately sweet without being cloying. Flavors of carmel, dark bread, molasses, figs, vanilla bean, and raisins dominate balanced by a very modest bitterness from the roasted malt and the 50 IBU's of bitterness contributed by the hops. The oak bourbon barrel overtones are quite noticeable and add in a very positive way to the aroma and taste of the beer. They are perfectly integrated into the nose, the taste, and the finish. The finish allows a little more of the hop bitterness to linger but there is a nice sustained carmel sweetness providing a perfect balance. The 9.8% ABV is well hidden, with the beer providing only mild alcohol heat. A very drinkable beer that is complex yet perfectly balanced. This may be one of my top ten favorites. This beer could be reasonably categorized as a barley wine rather than as a classic ""Old Ale"" such as Theakston's Old Peculiar.

Poured from a bottle into a brandy sniffer.

Ap: Hardly any head, with a burnt orange appearance.

Ar: Caramel, dark fruit (raisons, figs, dates) with a little bit of oak. The alcohol is hot!

T: On my first sip, I tasted nothing but oak and alcohol. More bitterness than sweetness. Later, I detected maple and brown sugar. Is there bourbon in this?

P: The alcohol burns the mouth, which I did not find pleasant. The texture is very thick and almost chewy. 

O: The ABV is definitely detectable and then some! Even though this style is supposed to be kind of hot on the palate, this overstays its welcome in that department. Once my mouth got used to those flavors, it got better.

Overall: Ive had this one a couple of times before and I really want to cheer for it each time because Founders is one of the best in the biz. However, even after analyzing it in my session, this still remains one of my least favorite Founders brews.","Washington DC, USA","Chaneybr"

3666,"2013-05-07",4.1,"Aroma is dominated by malt notes with only a slight earthy, dank secondary hop note. Malt has nice dark caramel notes, some toffee and a noticeable chocolate character. There is also notes of toasted bread, raisins and cherries. A light vanilla note is also present. 
Pours a fairly cloudy burnt amber with copper and brown notes. Quite a bit of what looks to be chill haze. Head is a thick light tan color but it quickly recedes to the edges. 
Flavor is similar to the aroma and is dominated by malt. Lots of toasted bread along with caramel, toffee and chocolate. Mid palate you get a moderate bitterness that helps balance the sweet malt and a touch of an earthy hop flavor. The finish has a bit more chocolate notes as well as some dark fruit. There is quite a bit of raisin and cherry along with fig. Nice, balanced vanilla and oak note also in the finish. A touch of alcohol spice in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium low carbonation. Astringency is low an alcohol warmth is moderate. 
Overall a very enjoyable old ale. Very well balanced with nice malt character and just the right amount of hops and barrel note. The malt has great complexity and the beer doesn't finish too sweet.

Probably from the molasses. Mouthfeel is similar to a heavy stout, like Ten Fidy. Kind of sticky, sugary. No hint of alcohol, even at almost 10%. Super smooth, easy drinking.

3666,"2013-03-17",4.1,"12 bottle from polomagnifico.  Thanks, Ryan!  Deep toffee brown with a pillowy fading head and no lacing.  Nose of toffee and some dates and bread dough.  Full bodied, almost chewy.  Toffee, tobacco, and sweet malts, but very balanced and alcohol well integrated.  This has aged very well.  Very remininiscent flavor profile to Great Divide Hibernation, but where that is dry and more on the tobacco/leather side, this is a sweeter riff on that theme, more like a barleywine.  Very enjoyable.  Nose is a little flat but a great package.  Prefer it to Backwoods Bastard which I find a bit hot and sweet.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"

3666,"2013-03-07",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2013 Pours very nice dark burnt orange with a small amount of beige fizz. The aroma is lightly smooth sweet grains and some oaky vanilla. The flavor is rich with a lot of grain shown but it doesn?t come off too sweet, too bittering, or too strong, very smooth earthy quality. The oak is what pops first with a bright wood and moderate vanilla leaving a pseudo whiskey feeling on the palate after it?s gone. Lingering red grape, apple, and a sort of plum thing linger with the oakiness to mellow into a wonderful smooth delicious beverage, so easy to drink at 10% I have to slow myself . The carbonation is lower which fits well and makes it feel like a snifter type of drink. Thank you again Founders. -- aged one year-- smooth grains more sweet with tasty berry fruit notes from yeast.

Taste has a good deal of malty toffee sweetness along with earthy molasses, tannic oak and some piney hop bitterness.  Finishes with lingering pine and earthy bitter. Mouthfeel is semi slick with a medium/full body and low/moderate carbonation.  A tad on the sweet side and a bit too much bitterness.  I prefer it with some age. 2 year old bottle drank on 11/17/14:  Pours a murky orange honey color with a light tan finger of head that disappears quickly leaving little lacing.  Aroma is a bit sweet with toffe, toasted malt and mild spices.  Taste is somewhat sweet with some caramel and dark molasses.  Has an earthy spiciness and a flavor sort of reminiscent to burnt marshmallow along with a bit of booziness.  Finishes with some earthy roasted flavor.  Medium bodied with low carbonation.

Malty, caramel, maybe fig, sweet grapes, maple syrup notes, and more vanilla than the nose. Sweetness builds, vanilla and maple notes linger.

Taste is quite sweet, with an even mix of maltiness and alcohol that does call bourbon to mind (albeit far more drinkable).  Mouthfeel is slightly thick with a light, fizzy carbonation.  Despite the high alcohol content, there is a rather tame finish to this beer, deceptively masking its potency.

3666,"2012-10-06",3.2,"UPDATED: MAY 1, 2013 This is a re-rate.  Got a bad bottle the first time, I think.  Pours deep amber brown with a small yellowish head on top.  Aroma is molasses, oak, HUGE malt, and actually a bit of dark fruit.  Very low carbonation, and a thick viscous mouthfeel.  Flavor is all malt forward with a definite oak presence.  Sweet and sticky, with the sweet coming from a combination of caramel malt and some fruit flavor.   Will certainly warm you with the alcohol, though it isnt too assertive.   I can appreciate the massive malt presence, but Im not sure I believe this is ""balanced"", as Founders claims.  Still not a huge fan of this one, but certainly better than the first bottle I had (that one got a 1.8).  Up front it is a bit much, but it can grow on you a bit as you sip through.

The aroma offers malt, alcohol, oak, vanilla, banana, and rum.

The flavor is strong and complex. As prefaced in the nose, alcohol, malt, and banana are the prevalent flavors. The beer is still a bit hot, and could likely benefit from some cellar time.

The feel is medium-heavy on the palate, with alcohol content noticeable throughout. Carbonation is moderate.

Overall, a decent brew from a great brewery. This one is a good candidate for sharing a few ways.

3666,"2012-08-25",2.7,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.

A: Pours a burnt sienna color with huge, oily-looking chunks of sediment plopping down into the glass. That plus very little head means this is one ugly-ass beer - almost to the point where Im afraid to sip it.

S: Quite strong with molasses, mint, and caramel, while darker fruits help augment the malt backbone. Pretty nice smelling, and a lot more promising than the look of the beer.

T: The flavor is hard to describe. The first sip is loaded with caramel, dark fruit, brown sugar, and a little finishing booze; a few sips later, the profile changes to that of slightly burnt pumpernickel bread. Not as sweet as I expected, probably due to the age of the bottle and the yeast eating some of the sugar - despite that, its still a bit cough syrup-y at times. Kind of boozy, also. Just a weird, strange beer, one that Im struggling to finish.

M: Thickly textured, with tannins helping to neutralize the finish somewhat. Nice creaminess to start, before the body itself finishes slightly coarse and sticky. Rather boozy feeling on the throat in particular.

O: Meh. In fairness, this is not a good late afternoon kind of beer, but I still found it rather mediocre despite that. A rare misfire from Founders, but its not completely irredeemable.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

3666,"2012-05-30",2.6,"Beer pours a red amber, cloudy with a white lacing, no head; that fizzes out pretty soon after pouring. Smells of dark fruits and alcohol, most particularly figs, whiskey and cherry. Im sure this is good for a whiskey barrel aged ale it is pretty smooth and balances well with the malt. Im never a fan of dark fruit with high alcoholic beers. Combined with the whiskey it tastes like Im drinking something quite strong though the taste isnt overly strong and their is no burn.  Finishes a tad bitter with dry taste of figs.","Rhode Island, USA","RyanK"
3666,"2012-05-30",3.6,"12 ounce pour at the Founders Brewery. Amber color bordering on red with a good dose of palate sizzle. Raisins, figs, and that sort of fig-newton dipped in whiskey flavor.  In other words, it has that fruit-alcohol presence and while it tastes strong fisted, its not nearly as strong as youd expect from a 9.8 abv. Its not necessarily my favorite from Founders, but its high quality nonetheless.","Illinois, USA","brian60625"

3666,"2012-05-24",4.0,"12oz bottle with 4/6/12 stamped on the neck.

APPEARANCE: Poured reddish-brown in color with over two fingers of cream colored head.  When held up to the light, it was more of a murky orangish-red.  The head settled to a thin layer after about 10 minutes, but left behind plenty of nice lacing on the glass (especially for the high alc. content).

AROMA: Carmel malt, molasses, brown sugar, cough syrup, cinnamon, and some wood in the nose.

TASTE: Im getting some nice caramel malt up front followed closely by a good amount of hop bitterness.  Very sticky feel between the resinous hops and the sweet malt.  They also work well together helping to balance the beer.  Finish has a touch of alcohol, but I like it. 

MOUTHFEEL: Medium-full body (boarderline syrupy) with fairly light carbonation.

The aroma and taste is like strong iced tea, with some caramel sweetness to follow. Palate is full-bodied and thick. A slight fruitiness and a flash of bitter rounds out this brew. The caramel malt increases in intensity as it warms. The 9.8% is fairly well masked. A slow sipper for sure, with a lot of subtle nuance with that hefty malt. Update: I found a bottle with an April date and sat on it for about 6 months and found that this helped improve that character of the beer. Much more rounded flavors, and I got more nuance in the aroma that made for a more pleasurable experience.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"

The nose is sweet and malty with tons of caramel, brown sugar, a slightly vegetal and burnt bitter aroma, with hints of chocolate and cinnamon underlying.

3666,"2011-06-07",3.9,"(bottle from 09)  Pours out a rich tawny color with a light yellowish-tan head that leaves good lacing when swirled in the snifter.  A nice aroma greets the nostrils with scents of oxidation, strawberry jam, vanilla, peanut butter, booze soaked raisins, caramel, and toast.  For the most part, this smells like an aged barleywine, which is a smell I very much enjoy.   Flavor follows much the same as the aroma, with a large presence of caramel, some prune, Assam tea (on the finish particularly).  A little bit of honey thrown into the mid as well.  There is a little brightness lurking on the edge of perception which tastes most similar to a fresh slightly unripe strawberry or plum skin.  The tea-like note really does a good job at reigning this in from being too sweet.  Mouthfeel is full and chewy and the carbonation is quite low.  Aging has done this beer well, as I remember a fresher bottle being too hot and boozy.  The alcohol is minimal in this aged version.

As the it warmed up, there was more and more strong dark fruit flavors especially plum, which combined with the alcohol gave it a somewhat boozy quality.

On a recent trip to Kansas City I was excited to find some Founders.  I picked up a sixer of their Old Curmudgeon.  This beer pours a deep orange to brown, and is apparently bottle conditioned.  Who knew.  (I did not).  So the color is a little murky but I blame that more on my amateurish pour than anything else.  Not a lot of head.  Smells sweet, with dark molasses and brown sugar undertones.  Taste is hefty, with a very very thick mouthfeel and clearly apparent alcohol level.  The amount of hops present in the beer makes it taste almost like a Barleywine, as opposed to an Old Ale as it claims to be.

3666,"2011-03-28",4.1,"An amber/orange/copper color.  Cannot see through this beer.  Very small head that was an off white color.  Probably due to the high alcohol content.  Had some decent legs after each sip.  A sweet nose of dried fruit.  Some caramel and some nuttiness reminiscent of peanut butter fudge.  Very nice.  A few notes of alcohol.  Similar to a brandy or wine.  Very complex and very well balanced.  A sweet molasses flavor combined with a caramel malt.  Im also getting some dark fruit.  Something similar to black cherries.  The brandy type alcohol flavors are there, but they are not tart or overbearing.  The nuttiness is not very prominent in the taste.  Medium/full mouthfeel.  Chewy.  Somewhat smooth.  A very nice bit of alcohol warmth all the way through.  Nicely dry.  Leaves more than enough on the palate.  This is an excellent beer.  Its a sipper, however and not conducive to a high drinkability standard.  Very complex.  This would go well on a cold night while reading a book.

Pours into my snifter a beautiful clear reddish orange with a creamy ivory head that lasts for a good amount of time before slowly receding and leaving some nice lacing.

The smell is luscoius. There is tons of caramel and butterscotch. It is also earthy with a touch of hops. There is also a stark dark fruit scent. It is a very luxurious looking and smelling beer.

The taste isnt as good as the other two but it is very good. It is alot more bitter than expected with a nice hop bite. The malt is here too and it is almost cloyingly sweet. There is an abundance of caramel on the palate. 

The mouthfeel is thick but has a nice, smooth carbonation, it is slightly cloying but not overly form the sugar and alcohol.

The alcohol in this one isnt perfectly hidden but it works well and makes this one feel like a strong barleywine going down.

Overall it is one beautiful looking and beautifully scented brew, the taste is good but not spectacular.

Simple caramel and honey sweetness harbors citrusy hops and their leafy bitterness, producing an enjoyable but relatively unmemorable Old Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slab of foam tops the amber.
-The soft carbonation reveals the simplicity and generosity of the malt profile.
-This is very similar to most English-style Barley Wines brewed this side of the Atlantic.
-This doesnt dazzle from the malt-side of things or from the hops, so I cant say Ill go for it often.

Palate: while the nose sounds disjointed, like his palate all flavors were spot on and unique while also working together in exquisite tastiness.

Very tasty and surprisingly drinkable. Ugly complexion, though.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

3666,"2010-11-05",4.0,"Aroma: being as the rating guide indicates that ""aroma is one of a beers most complex features,"" I wish I were better at rating an aroma, unfortunately, even with the appropriate glassware, I had tremendous difficulty getting any strong whaft whatsoever, only subtle sweet, it is as if this beer holds in its aroma in exchange for its wonderfully complex taste; Appearance: hazy, light brown bordering on tan, looks rather unfiltered, thin tan head on pour that quickly dissipates; Taste: just fantastic, right off the bat, it reminded me of the Chimay series, but I think this one has a better balance between the up front sweetness and the bitterness that lingers on the palate only after the swallow, also, it is easy to pull out the bready, more doughy actually, aspect that the malt gives it; Palate: as said, the bitterness lingers in a wondeful way, it hides and waits its turn, in no way getting in the way of the sweetness and maltiness that you get to enjoy with each swallow; Overall: this beer is wonderful, as my first beer from Founders, I must say I am absolutely impressed, after inspecting the ratings given to several other Founders offerings, I am eager to give this line of brews more attention, find a curmudgeon and share a draught of this fine beer with him!","Illinois, USA","MacDouglass"

There, it sat virtually still in its opaque reddish glory, obscured by a number of floaties and raising a tiny head that dissipated almost immediately. The aroma is sweet with brown sugar, grade b maple syrup, and aged wood. The flavor follows suit, with an overpowering and complex sweetness that fades into a mildly bitter finish. The texture is sweet, viscous, almost syrupy, but the body is lighter than those notes imply, making it drinkable despite the high alcohol content. Im not a great fan of old ales, but this is a great old ale.","Athens, Georgia, USA","bjt512"

Like a true curmudgeon this sat stubbornly in the back of the fridge for the better part of a year. Finally while cleaning out old stock I decided to give it a shot. Once again Founders has done a great job with a style that would be all too easy to go over the top with. The result is an above average old ale that exemplifies many of the traits that set apart the best from those where people just went by the book.

Aroma / Appearance - Caramel / mahogany liquid oozed from the bottle into the glass like a river of warm syrup. A nice white head was like a sheet of icing over a rich decadent brownie. Chocolate brownies with heavy caramel glaze mingled with the smell of a fresh carton of hardcover books waiting to be shelved. There is enough depth and heaviness that the booziness is no surprise but it doesnt overwhelm at all.

Flavor / Palate - Caramel chews, rich chocolate creme pie, and dried pine cones interact well. Next come figs and maple along with a heavy malt presence. Finally the dry finish warms the throat like standing near a fire on a cold winter day. Solid and well balanced this has everything you would expect to find in an old ale. If there were more of these in the cellar I wouldnt be disappointed. Perhaps I will pick some up the next time it hits store shelves.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
3666,"2010-10-30",4.5,"Wow did I ever enjoy this ale! A thin head on top of one of the richest tastes of smokey caramel. At first I thought the flavor was sorghum due to the slight sweetness. Very thick on the pallet. It was like a liquid Snickers bar, with the same after taste as brandy. I would have guessed the alcohol was higher due to this. Beautiful tawny brown color with lots of suspended sediment. Definitely one to look up if you enjoy sweet brown ales.","Buford, Georgia, USA","RFWobbly"

Appearance: Dispensed into a simple, all-purpose goblet a hazed, mahogany-hued body with a scant, white head.

Smell: A rich, invitingly malty nose smelling of caramel, chunks of toast, and brown sugar stirred up into cake batter. Fruity notes of citrus, cherries, and green raisins punctuated by some stinging alcoholic wafts.

Taste: The lush, tempting sweetness of heavily caramelized sugars with additional tastes of toasted bread, light brown sugar, and spiced holiday cake. The fruitiness from the aroma is well-represented in a taste of raisins marinated in cherry liqueur and spiced with a bit of dried orange peel. Moderate bitterness provides a bit of balance, though this one remains fairly on the sweet side of things. Soft, sweet finish with plenty of alcohol warmth rolling in.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body, with a mouthfeel both smooth and a bit sticky. Medium-low carbonation.

3666,"2010-05-14",3.5,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2010 March 2010 vintage, tasted May 14, 2010

Consumed unaged. Pours a vibrant red with a decent head, fading to runny but bubbly lacing.  Aroma is intense, but hard to pin down.  Theres a earthy element, oakiness, an alcohol note that smells like rum.  That first sip is a little rough, intense alcohol burn right up front, sweet, with a finish that tends towards mildly hoppy.  Lots of alcohol burn on the way down.  This says its only 9.8%, but it drinks like a 15%.   The alcohol is so intense it crowds out the other, subtler elements.
7/5/6/3/10 - 3.1

March 2009 vintage, consumed November 6, 2010

Right off the bat the aroma is potent but way more pleasant than my notes from May would inform me.   Pours a deep, ruby caramel with a moderate head and super-fine, sort of foamy, moderate lacing.  Dark fruits, toffee, caramel, treacle, port, all sorts of amazing aromas, and little to no fusel tones.  The palate fares a lot better too, rich malt backed up by significant hop bittering but very smooth, with creamy mouthfeel and noticeable carbonation.  There is still a lot of alcohol bite on the palate, which disappoints me for a beer thats been aging for so long and is under 10%.
9/5/7/4/14 - 3.9

My score for this is based off the average the fresh and aged scores (the official A/A/T/P reflects the higher of the two, with the Overall being modified to meet that middle point).  I expect a lot from a brewery with such a solid roster of beer and reputation as Founders.  I consider the fresh version of this to be really rough to drink, and thats unfortunate because with some age, its a really interesting brew.  If a beer isnt enjoyable right off the bat, they should either pre-age it longer or recommend some aging guidelines on the bottle.  I know my Dieu du Ciel Rigor Mortis Abt recommended cellaring for at least six months before consumption, so if I were to pop that one open fresh and be disappointed Id have no one to blame but myself.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","RyanMM"

Head sits around the top circumference of the beer. Translucent, nearly opaque, brown color with an orange hue. Im not really keen on judging the old ales, so dont consider this a judging according to the style. Hmmm...I could swear that I smell vanilla and sugar in this. There might be a subtle syrup aroma in there as well. Smells reminiscent of the Nemesis, in my opinion of course, just not so boozy. I am liking the aroma though. A light bitter aroma penetrates the nostrils, but not in an intrusive way i.e. a light bitter aroma. Wow, a nice sweet caramel finish. Honestly,  I can taste the caramel candy flavor. What the fuck are those caramel chews called? Well, whatever they are called I definitely taste them. Nice sweet sugar and vanilla aroma. Slight bitterness carries through. Alcohol is a bit hot in this one, considering other beers with higher ABVs have hidden the alcohol better than this. Very smooth palate; dare I say ""dangerously smooth."" Sweetness seems to be diminishing as the beer warms. As it warms the alcohol and hops are taking over. I dont like this afore mentioned factor at all.

Laces the glass extremely well. Smells very sweet. Lots of caramel in this one. Not complex, but straightforward and nice. Maybe even a little sweet smelling for a guy who loves sweet beers. Quite a bit of alcohol in the nose too. Taste is oddly up front with hops and caramel both, but somehow theyre not really balanced. Theyre just both strong flavors and dont seem to play too well together. Despite this I find the beer highly enjoyable and like how it tastes. Carbonation is really nice for the style, and the weight is just right too. I wish there had been some head to give this beer some creaminess though.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"

Thick, viscous and oily. This one definitely qualifies as chewey. Yet still smooth.

The smell is malty (caramel and fudge) with notes of ripe fruit (grapes, strawberries?) vanilla and spices. Its a rather rich smell. Its good, but something seems off, like its going downhill or something.

A malt-forward taste with pleasant flavors of caramel and toffee. Lots of fruity notes. The taste is sweet but balancing spicy notes level the sweetness. Heres also an interesting note of vanilla. The finish has some nice bitterness to it and notes of wood and malts.

Medium body with a rather creamy and slick texture.

A decent beer. But Old ales raise my expectations and this one didnt really meet them. There are far better examples of the style.

3666,"2009-11-16",3.7,"Location: 12 oz bottle from Norms, 11/16/09


Aroma: Gives off  both sweet an alcoholic, notes of bourbon, orange, caramel, other fruits, a bit of earthiness, and some vanilla

Appearance: This one pours a cloudy dark red-orange color with almost no head to speak of, it leaves very light/spotty lace

Flavor: Tastes of sweet malts, some sugar, with kind of an orange-bourbon feel, plus a touch of spice, and a mild hop backing

Palate: This beer has a pretty full body, there is also some minimal carbonation and a bit of alcohol burn

Overall Impression: 
This beer is a bit strange, almost a hybrid orange-bourbon-beer combination type of thing.  Hard to describe, but not completely outside the norm.  It does have many of the typical Old Ale and Barleywine characteristic, but it also has some unusual characteristics to it as well.  I like this one, but Im not sure Id want to drink it regularly.  On the other hand, it is very interesting, and does appear to be pretty well-made, so Im split.  Im going to give the overall score a boost for the creativity, even if the other scores dont indicate it being quite that high.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

The massive malt continues on the tongue with a quick hop burst. The sweet caramel, and toasted malt notes push the hops to the side and roll on to the back. Medium-full bodied brew offers a nice creaminess as it glides over the tongue. As the beer reaches the back it thins out with alcohol and rockets down your throat with a nice warming effect. The hops then jump on this chance to pop back up in to the back-sides of your mouth. The hops and pure caramel stick around and have a party until the next sip arrives. Thats a nice beer.

In long: Nose is boozy (higher alcohols feel) and sweet.  Taste is toasted raisin bread, cake, figs, brown sugar, sticky caramel.  The beer is excessively sweet, annoyingly so.  No hops presence which is not surprising given the style.  Alcohol is very present and feels even more than the 9.8%.  To make a long story short Ill say that this beer tastes list a rum baba.

Amazing symphony of barrel and beer.  Pours a hazy red-brown with a minimal white-ish head.  Nose is brandy, spice, raisin, booze, toffee, ripe fruit, figs, plums, and all manner of goodness.  Flavor gives chills... brandy, raisin, whiskey, overripe dark fruit, vanilla, and barrel.  A mountain of sweetness, but not oversweet.  This beer is like enjoying the company of an old friend.  Medium-bodied and beautiful to look at and enjoy.  Every sip brings remarks of ""holy shit,"" but in a good way, not like Mbege.

Flavors of sweet, dark fruit, cookie, biscuit, nut, and apricot. Starts malty sweet but finishes with a citrus-hoppy tang. Hoppier than I thought it would be. Medium to full body. Oily and lively in the palate. A solid if not particularly outstanding barley wine.

Flavor is dominated by heavy doses of malt and caramel.  Malt flavors manifest themselves as dark fruit, vanilla and sugarcane.  Carbonation is low which lends a vintage character to the beer.  Has the texture of slightly watered down maple syrup which is great because its thick, but not like drinking malt extract.  Has a tiny Bourbon kick on the finish and leaves a short sugar coating on the tongue.

Initial is moderate in body, fruity up front with some dark fruits and orange like notes, perhaps even a touch of apricot. Further in, the malt becomes more notable, with bits of spice and a small pleasant bittering finish. Touches of brown sugar, vanilla, and the fruitiness really work well together, coupled with some nice malty toffee and caramel feel.

3666,"2009-03-29",3.2,"Beautiful sunset amber pour displaying an ephemeral white cover. This version bought in September 2008 was actually labeled as 9.8% and it makes for a very heady aroma. No wonder the ratings are so high, this is high octane stuff. Fortunately, the malt base is solid with its deep mango/apricot duo thick pancakes bathing in maple syrup rich, toasty, bready cereal profile. As it even begins to warm up though, massive amounts of diacetyl emanates. Im usually not all that disturbed by butteriness, especially not in beers like scotch ales, old ales or barleywines, but this surpasses my generous threshold. Liquid alcoholic toffee, rather chewy and thick besides for the overly biting carbonation that removes any English aspiration. It has its strong points with this type of malt richness, but were it a delicate offering, its integrated flaws would make me rate it under 3. I will not go so low as I still find it pleasant, but cant call it a great beer and would never consider going as high as its current 3.8 average.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

3666,"2009-03-20",3.8,"12oz brown glass twist-top. No date.

Appearance: Tawny orange/brown. No head to speak of, and somewhat cloudy (no sediment though).

Nose: Sweet raisin bread, apricots, toasted cashews, deep caramel, milk chocolate, dried figs.

Palate: Medium- to full-bodied with loads of sugar up front. Dried fruits (figs, raisons, prunes) mingle with a layer of light milk chocolate (low cocoa %), and some flavors that remind me of tawny/colheita ports and malmsey madeiras. Rich and somewhat thick, there is a moderate edge from the hop bitterness.

Notes: A well made Old Ale, will improve over short-term ageing, but I dont think its made to go for more than 3 years with improvement. I would like to see more hop character for longer ageing.

3666,"2009-01-30",4.5,"12 oz bottle purchased at Chucks Liquor in Bowling Green.  I believe that this must be a 2006 bottle, because this beer was full of bourbon notes.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a medium to dark brownish orange with a hardly there, off-white head that mostly lasted. What little was there hung around for a long while. The aroma was heavy caramel malt, moderate pine hops, light to moderate yeast, toffee vanilla, alcohol, brandy, orange, spices, slightly soured fruit and a little of that special barley wine smell. The flavor started sweet and a little bitter, and finished mostly bitter with some alcohol and an average to long duration. There was caramel malt, alcohol, spicy yeast, toffee and some orange hops. The medium to full body was sort of syrupy with tingly carbonation and a slightly metallic and lightly alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

The nose is an interesting fruity blend of pineapple, caramel, craisins and lighter notes of brown sugar and alcohol. Medium to full-bodied and oily with fine carbonation and a dry, moderately bitter resinous finish. The flavor is of round malt and woody tobacco notes with a resinous finish; absolutely nothing like the nose.This is a decent big beer, but the nose and flavor are about as far apart from one another as I can imagine them being, and I had really been hoping for a bit more from this beer.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

Flavor is very similar, almost exact in fact, except even more passive. Watery palate, finish is moderate in bourbon. Overall unique but rather bland, I cannot understand what the intent was here, just really odd.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
3666,"2008-12-15",3.7,"Bottle: Pours a hazy amber/copper with a dense light tan, thin head. Big aroma- vanilla sweetness is there with some dark fruit notes of plum, fig, sherry, maple, and a mild booziness. Big bodied, but never cloying. Chewy, big malt presence in the flavor. Plum, honey, dates, bitter dark fruit skins, spicy ethanol notes, but it is smooth in its booziness- almost rummy. The finish has residual toasted malt qualities along with a long resiny hop presence to dry out the initial big malt body. Despite its high gravity, it remains drinkable. This solid Old Ale may improve with time.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

Mild aromas of spicy caramel apple. Tastes of dark-roasted nut, spiced apples, light cocoa, whiskey and oak. Normally this is a blend of flavors I would rave over, but the twangy apple flavor in this one misses the mark a bit for me. Near-medium body is lightly tingly and dryish.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"

Nose is faint but is yeast and spices that remind of Chrismas fragrances.  Alcohol is a dominant theme in the flavor and this one is complex in old style way.  Dark fruit, pepper spice, candi sugar, yeast, and attitude.  There is just so much going on in there and drinking it puts me in an old Europe seaside pub.  What a good and well crafted beer.

3666,"2008-12-09",4.1,"I’m a sucker for old ales. I had backwoods bastard last night and this one has the bourbon tones but they are more subdued to allow for a complex mix of raisins, ginger, chocolate malts, vanilla, tangerine and mahogany. The alcohol somewhat diminishes the flavors but old ales should have some kick. The other factor is the hop quotient which adds a bitterness I don’t associate with this malty style.","East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","JFURYCAT"

Sugary micro-spots of lace mark the glass.  Aromatics include a heavy toffee malt base, caramel, butterscotch, vanilla, and a touch of dark rum.  Light, fruity notes follow, everything from zesty white grapes to bruised nectarines.  Floral hop notes come through on the back end.  Flavors follow suit, sweet from the toffee and caramel, with balancing floral and citrus hops.  Creamy butterscotch schnapps are a nice addition, with oak-aged dark rum adding French vanilla notes and a touch of heat.  Fruity, floral hops lend balancing bitterness on the finish.

The aroma is heavy on sweet caramel malts and dark sweet fruits.  There is definitely a wood and bourbon presence but not overpowering.  There are some floral hops up front as well.

The taste is boozier than the aroma with lots of bourbon and oak throughout.  The flavor has the sweetness of the caramel malts and molasses but it takes a back seat to the barrel character.

The mouthfeel is crazy smooth but with good carbonation.  Just coats the mouth wonderfully.

3666,"2008-11-19",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2012 Bottle thanks to TURDFERGUSON. Labeled at 9.8% ABV so I am assuming it is the Bourbon Barrel version or something recent. Pours with a light brown head and a slightly hazed, pretty reddish amber body. Head fades to a ring after a while and leaves pretty good lacing. Aroma is alcohol (Brandy with notes of vanilla and bourbon), with tons of caramel and a bit of fruit behind the alcohol burn from my snifter. Tastes is alcohol and a bit of bitter butterscotch, with a touch of dirt or cobwebs, some fruits, and raisins. Alcohol is not well hidden at all (but that is okay by me). Creamy mouthfeel and light carbonation. Another good Founders Beer. 
Re-rate: Bottle marked 4/6/12. Pours with a murky amber hued body with a lasting off-white head. Decent lace. Aromas show a bit of raw popcorn, toasted malt and caramel (no bourbon, which was quite evident the last time I tried it). Cereal grain, toffee, malty, chewy, cornbread, clean and complex malt character. Flavors are of cornbread, buttery biscuit, burn bread. Nice toasted malt character, a decent amount of caramel without being too sweet. Very light esters (mostly dried fruits). Malt character is strongly toasty and dry with a somewhat light hop bitterness, slightly soapy in character. Becomes a bit hard to drink as it warms as the bitterness comes out a bit. Light chlorine. Fuller body, very viscous mouthfeel, sweet, fuller alcohol, still finishes dry with a grainy balance.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

Smooth, moderately sweet entry with some light hints of fig that lead into a caramel maltiness with some fruity raisin undertones that finishes with some oxidization.

3666,"2008-10-31",3.9,"12oz bottle. Pours a hazy deep red with ruby highlights, specks of bottle-conditioned-sediment floating lazily. The head is virtually non-existent. What bubbles do form are very small and light-tan in color, forming a thin ring around the perimeter of the glass at the surface of the beer - leaving slight/trace amounts of lace on the glass here and there. The aroma is very malty with a strange metallic air at first followed by vinous malts, soft fruit, some hoppiness (slightly vegetal, piney), and a noticeable wallop of alcohol, too. The flavor starts very malty and mellow with some woodiness and a nice layer of hops - piney and spicy. At mid-tongue, there is a great balance of big, bold malts with a good bit of sweetness and bitter hops that are fruity, slightly earthy, and spicy. The finish is full but not cloying with a nice thick malt ending that is well-balanced with a good bit of fruit, some wood (subtle smoke), and a very pleasant and strong hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is full and oily (not quite syrupy) with a lot of suds (spritzier and lighter than expected from the complete lack of foam upon pouring). There is a slight astringenct sensation on the middle and back of the tongue that is only slight and not unpleasant - from alcohol, bitterness, and carbonation combined. The beer is warming in the chest as you drink it down without tasting like alcohol (though it certainly tastes big). Overall, a very pleasant experience.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Very floral, potpourri noticeable.  A sudden memory smacks me as I smell this.  Something very distinct, very singular jumps out.  I try very hard to pinpoint it.  Sushi?  Wasabi?  No.  Blue cheese.  Distinctly blue cheese.  Stilton, Roquefort.  Crazy how accurate that descriptor is right now.  Pungent and cheesy.  Also some dark/red fruit aromas, similar to a Flanders Red are apparent though subtle.  Taste is similar to the aroma, though sweetness is very muted.  This tastes a little young, not from apparent alcohol but it seems muted, non-complex; it needs to open up a little and I think age will do the trick.

A slight fruit presence accompanies the malt, but is overtaken in the finish by a hoppy bitterness.  The balance of this beer is quite impressive.  Regardless of serving temperature, this one instantly has a warming effect as it travels down your throat.  Surprisingly though, the alcohol is not very noticable.

Many thanks.  12oz bottle pours a dense, translucent, amber brown with a thin beige head and slightly visible carbonation noticeable around the edge of the glass.

Flavor is similar with raisins, caramel chews, vanilla, oaky bourbon, wood, cherries, light tobacco, chocolate and quite earthy.  Thick, chewy, sticky and creamy on the palate with some lasting bitterness and a touch of lasting sweetness like butterscotch.

3666,"2008-06-09",3.9,"Ruddy mahogany pour; mostly still body leaving no foam.  Sweet, robust aroma; silky chocolate, raisins, dates, roasted peanuts.  A burly, damp cavendish tobacco darkness and a spicy, velvety touch of nutty bourbon in a slow, heavy pressure of erudite sweetness; hints of toasted coconut and spirited heat in the back.  Layered carefully and composed; delightful to inhale. 
Flavor is full and simple; chocolate mousse, figs, and molasses; growing more complex and forceable as it dresses itself in a fanciful, rich spirit imitation.  Earthy and rustic, while sophisticatedly clean.  Syrupy, almost, in caramelly, nutty, dark bourbon impartation; the rich wooden character and anise-like darkness of the spirit flavor is extremely cordial and charming.  What a nice surprise.

Palate is full and round; oily, barely carbonated; like velvet.  Filtration seems to strip it down just a touch in a clean, roasty, sweet finish.  Almost too polished at this point, where a lingering, dirty, earthy bittersweetness would seem most fitting.  Excepting that complaint and the sometimes loud contribution of the bourbon barrel, pleasant as it is, the warm settled malt character of this one is striking enough to overcome.

Deep caramel chestnut pour lets just a bit of light through, with a light light brown head.  The lures are just sultry.  Rich, full taste of strong caramel and fig, 
lightly bitter with a little less sweetness (dryness wins out by the end), and dominant notes of vanilla, bourbon, and wood.  Alcohol stronger toward the end, and prominent as a significant contributor to the flavor.  Malt dominates whatever is left of the pine and citric hops, but thats not a bad thing here.  Brown sugar and a touch of cherry.  Viscous, thick body is smooth going down, not quite sticky but dense and layered.

I could smell this bad boy as soon as I opened it, so I knew that I wouldnt have to dig too much here.  This must be a 2006 bottle because theres a big oak presence here, got hints of bourbon and brandy interestingly enough. Additionally, got some caramel, malty sweetness, and a few times I caught some coconut in there, which was odd, but I love coconut, so hell yeah!  As the beer warmed up, the bourbon influence took over the aroma almost entirely.  But enough about how it smelled...thats just foreplay.  Taste was nice, mostly bourbon, but has a good background of malty sweetness to complement it.  Finish was pretty boozy, more bourbon of course.  Pretty sticky palate, definitely good for this sort of brew, despite its relative ease of drinking.  A good first impression for the Old Ale style on my tastebuds.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"

But a fine taste indeed. Whiskey again, with caramel and Sugar Babies in support. Dont go looking for hop character here, if youve held this for any length of time (this bottle about 6 months old), its been reduced to a small supporting role. Grpe juice, prune and blackberry impressions around the sticky, almost gooey brew. May be a bit too sticky for some, especially on this hot August Night (Neil Diamond reference; how postmodern of me).

Sweet on the tongue with a chewy, slick mouth feel and very little carbonation. The effects of bourbon barrel aging on the flavor are obvious with vanilla, whiskey, and oak flavors imparted.

Aroma is vanilla, maple, burnt orange and that wisp of whiskey.  Flavor follows suit, but is a an impressive performance, high notes seem to be a a symphony of sweetness, some bitter orange undertones.  The close is a heady bourbon flavor that is well integrated.

A creamy rich mouthfeel with very subdued carbonation and a velvety smoothness.  A woody bourbon note comes through over a great bit caramel malt backbone.  Wood is huge here, and the vanilla is big, but the tannic oak is what sticks out.  And actually, it reels in the malt well, making this a lovely balanced beer.  Cookie dough in the finish?  A little bit of diacetyl, but the aftertaste is dominated by vanilla and oak.

3666,"2007-05-11",4.0,"2006. Burnt orange pour. A brilliant color is diffused by substantial haze. A very thin off-white head forms and quickly fizzles out. With warmth and a gentle rousing, a more sizeable and lasting head is rustled up through a syrupy body. Lacing is thick and irregular. Aroma is forged of bourbon and wet oak, caramel and baking cocoa, sweet dark and ripe tree fruits, alcohol playing a moderate backing role. Lovely nose all around, enticing. Hops arent anywhere to be found, suitable for the style. The malt profile is elegant and weighty due to skillful employment of barrel aging. Flavor is delicious. Fruity character is massive and blends very well with the whisky notes. Actually tastes like fruit infused whisky. Light to medium bitterness and bold sweetness further compliment the heavy oak and roasty attributes. Light vanilla is revealed late, along with bold warming from the alcohol that is clearly apparent on the tongue. Finishes dry and fruity, sweet caramel lingering for a great length. Mouthfeel is adequately carbonated, lightly spicy, very smooth and full bodied. A lovely beer. Certainly an Americanized take on an old ale, worthy of its heritage.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Deep crimson hue with many particles dancing throughout.  Nice smooth creamy mouthfeel with sweet hints of the caramelized malt and bourbon beautifully blended together.

3666,"2007-04-22",3.3,"Amber colored out of the bottle with a very hesitant ivory head that retreated into a slight ring around the glass very quickly.  My first sniff of this warned me that this must be the bourbon barrel vintage.  Whiskey, wood, butter and alcohol all wafted up.  Overall the mouthfeel seemed a little watery, given the ABV and style.  Lots of noticable alcohol in the flavor, both actual from the 9.3% and suggusted from all the bourbon.  The barrel aging does impart lots of bourbon, oak, and the buttery sensation that I always get from bourbon barrel aged beers.  My complaint about barrel aging is when the barrel overwhelms the beer and this seems to be one of those times.  Flavors of vanilla, berry, oak, dried fruit; but all just washed out by the bourbon.  If you like bourbon barrel beers, here is one.  I prefer more balance with the beer.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

3666,"2007-04-05",3.9,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Transparent, golden honey colored pour with shades of ripened peach flesh and blood orange skins, topped with a thin layer of creamy caramel head.  Big, fruity aroma of fresh strawberries and drizzled caramel sauce over the top of some fresh vanilla ice cream.  Some pecan pralines and chewy raisins add further complexity.  Tantalizing.  A hint of alcohol is the only detractant in the bouquet, mild mannered, but noticeable in that its a sharp contrast to the soft nature of the other aromatics.    Full bodied, but filled with a light carbonation that really makes this one melt across the palate like a tingly dessert foam.  A little bit of black cherry, complete with pit tannins, and some caramelized, peaty suggestions of a single malt scotch.  Some broken leather and brandy touches as well.  A bit dryer in flavor, the oakiness from the barrel comes across more strongly in the mouth than in the nose, lingering especially strong in the finish.  Warming, bourbony finish.  I get the feeling that if this was aged properly, some fruity oxidation notes would really help open this one up a bit, as the fruity character in the nose is quite marvelous; the dryness and heat on the palate is a bit of a let down after such a pleasant olfactory introduction.  A nice treat, and certainly offers enough complexity to ponder.  Thanks, Tom!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Pleasing aroma of brown sugar, mellow bourbon, vanilla bean, polished wood and candied peaches.  Smooth and well-integrated flavor of concentrated malt and good bourbon.  Subtle fruity tones as well.  Medium sweet and moderately bitter with light emerging alcoholic warmth.  A nice old ale, on the young side, but could likely progress nicely.  Very enjoyable and sufficiently distinct all-around.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
3666,"2007-02-11",4.0,"Bottle courtesy of Degarth. Thanks again. Poured a murky-brackish brown with no head. The aroma is kind of light with shriveled up dates, plums and raisins. Behind that I also smell a nice sweet caramel. The flavor is complex and not altogether smooth. The flavor starts with a bolt of alcohol then alcohol soaked dates, plums and raisins. That takes the taste to beyond midway where a sweet caramel flavor takes over for the main note. Also joining the fun is a roasted maltiness and some cinnamon. Excellent winter sipping brew.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Minimal head but tons of carbonation rising from the bottom. The nose is pretty big - whiskey and peat. Those flavors persist in the taste, quite lovely, and theyre capped off by smooth caramel and malt. My biggest gripe is that the alcohol is a little too biting, would like it muted a bit more. Still, a really solid old ale that Id like to try again.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Thick, smooth mouth, finishing warm and coating. Everything I love about a barleywine is in abundance.

Astounding aroma of maple, honey, oak soaked bourbon. Heavy, heavy, inviting as hell, warm whiskey tone to this sucker. Wow. Wonderful.

Smooth and warming with a good source of whiskey tones behind some maple, honey, vanilla, and white grape accents. Tenderly toasted malt background but huge in malted girth and warmth of gooey rich and thick caramel, maple, toffee, and minor fruityness all encompassed by one very nice powering warmth of whiskey oaken woodyness. No real finishing qualities however as it slides off the back end with an unwanted speed before the warmth sets in with just a slight backburst of crisp vanilla and left over whiskey wood.

Feel is warm, and more warm, and more warm. Strange how some beers with more then 9.3% seem to have no omff while this screams it. Big, bold, and beautiful; rich, smooth, and full. The only set back is the forementioned finish which is escapingly ghostly and parting in a manner that throws a curve in its overall, powering presence.

Be that as it may, that is what makes this quite a drinkable, dandy treat. For if it were all but power and strength, this would not be as easy to handle and may as well just be whiskey at that point.

3666,"2006-09-24",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2008 2006 bottle, shared at acertains get-together.

The bourbon barrel aging is easily apparent here; this lovely beer provides a breathtaking sweet woody aroma with mellow bourbon notes. The mouthfeel is splendid, full and creamy, gently sweet in the flavor, lingering long with dry oak and sweet vanilla, coming splendidly into its own as it approaches room temperature.

For this was perhaps the highlight of an evening filled with extraordinarily good beers. Splendid. 9/4/9/5/16=4.3

Rerate March 15, 2008: Another 06 bottle.  Pours out a rather light caramel with almost no head. Woody bourbon (vanilla, not booze) dominates the aroma, some caramels coming through as well; the aroma is indeed really nice. Relatively mild sweetness, bourbon notes, lots of vanilla, butterscotch, subtle banana and other fruits. Mouthfeel seems thin today and maybe a touch too hot, woody dryness very late in the finish. The first sip was not so impressive -- certainly nowhere near the 4.3 that I gave it the first time around -- but as I progressed through the bottle I enjoyed this one well enough. Id go about  8/4/8/4/15, and Ill go straight to that score as this rating was based on a full bottle and the first beer a night, whereas the previous one was one of my few ratings added from a tasting situation.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
3666,"2006-09-24",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2007 Had this on draught at the ""Founders at Dilly Deli"" night on 9/21/2006...  Color is dark brown and kind of murky - quite intriguing in an inviting way.  This beer has quite a combination of characteristics in the aroma and flavor - strong and sweet at first, then a little spicy and fruity like raisins, and then slightly dry and bitter toward the end.  There are some hints of caramelized sugar, nuts, and wood in there as well.  Mouthfeel is medium to full and quite smooth.  A very interesting brew that has much complexity and tends to cause some pondering to sort out all the great flavors wafting around in it.  I definitely need to grab up a bottle of this to try it again and explore it deeper...

______________________________

10/11/2007:  Founders Curmudgeon Old Ale has a sophisticated sweet brandy-like aroma that contains deep caramelized malt, a rich cherry quality, and hints of alcohol and oak.  The color is a nearly opaque deep ruby color with a subtle level of carbonation, specks of suspended sediment, and a thin beige head.  The flavor is rich and very malty.  The sweetness drawns one in and the complexities really capture ones interest and attention.  The fruity (mostly cherry) maltiness is accompanied by caramel, vanilla, dry oak char, and a warming brandy flavor.  Some bitterness, candied citrus, and chocolate come through in the finish.  The alcohol is nicely tucked away under all the other flavors.  This beer has a medium-full to full body and is really quite smooth despite its thickness.  This particular Old Ale definitely improves with age...

The oakiness smoothes it out a little, but it cant overcome the intense sweetness.

Peppery bitterness from alcohol and hops linger in the finish. Overly sweet. Lots of alcohol. Not as god as I remember it.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
3666,"2006-06-28",3.5,"Bottle from Pailheadenstein.  Murky brown colored, no real head formation and no lacing left.  Aroma is kind of pleasant to me.  Full malty, bits of molasses and fruit.  Full bodied with a very low carbonation level.  Very sweet tasting, tons of residual sugars are left in this one.  Alcohol is pretty up front, I didnt pick up much bourbon notes in aroma or flavor with this, not that that is bad.  Decent, alcohol is a bit overbearing, could use a touch more carbonation but decent.","Alabama, USA","11026"
3666,"2006-06-26",3.1,"UPDATED: JUL 5, 2006 Bottle from Julios consumed on 6/26/06.Rich plum red color with strong copper-auburn overtones, minimally hazy, but with a fair amount of sediment already having settled at the bottom.  Tiny bubbles rise throughout and bolster an off-white-to-buttercream colored head that is neat and mostly well-retained.The nose is full and alive with coconut, light tannins and almost a citrus or pineapple note (also from the wood).  The beer behind it is a bit tame and difficult to discern.  I gave it quite a while to breath and have served it only lightly chilled to begin, but yet I cant get passed the pineapple/coconut of the barrel.  Not that it smells bad, Im just expecting plenty of malt as spoken about in the commercial description.Diving in to the flavor, Im yet again lost in a sea of bourbon, alcohol (very sharp) and coconut/pineapple.  The mouthfeel is silky, rich and extremely soothing, with light, appropriate carbonation and soft bubbles, but wheres all of this old ale?  Some lightly chewy prunes and raisins emerge on the finish, but the beer is dominated by bourbon/wood-tannin notes.  Hmm, maybe just needs more patience.  So letting it sit out a while longer, quite fully warmed, I now get a touch more smooth, semi-sweet toffee and plump raisins up front, but its chased away by the bourbon on end.  So Im near the end of the glass and not much has changed.  Sweet toffee, some light caramel and dark fruits, mostly bourbon and tannin.  Like a bourbon scotch ale, or a bourbon porter or bourbon barleywine.  Dont know whats ""Old Ale"" about this, certainly not an English Old Ale or anything remotely close.  Alcohol could be better hidden, malt depth is rather lacking, etc, etc, etc.  Mouthfeel stands out as a strong point and there is fair lacing is left in webs on the glass.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3666,"2006-06-26",3.9,"Bottle. No date. The editors note makes it sound like it was only bottled once. Ugly, multi-brown and a small, frothy, tan cap. Aroma of rich, roasty malt, wood, vanilla, bourbon, subtle yet pungent dark fruits. Flavor adds a peat like earthiness and a touch of smoke. Peaty finish. Old Scotch Ale. Big malty brew. Palate is a bit watery up front, but fills up quickly. Smooth. Great brew.","Florida, USA","SoLan"
3666,"2006-06-25",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2007 Pours a dark, amber/brown with virtually no head. The aroma is sweet oak and bourbon, some caramel and pine, but the bourbon is definatley the star of this show. The flavor is again bourbon, but it isnt too strong and lets the rest of the cast some out to play. Sticky sweet toffee and resinous pine, with touches of vanilla and raisins. The mouthfeel is very soft, accentuated by the very low level of carbonation. The finish is fairly dry with moderate bitterness and slightly warm. If you like bourbon barreling, you will certainly love this beer. For me, it is a bit too much, but nice inspite of it.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"

<!-- P -->
Aroma is pineapple (heavily) accented liquor that I assume is bourbon, but could pass for rum in a crowded bar. The aroma is quite unusual though and curiously it is more easily discerned sniffing from the bottle than from my snifter. In the bottle the aroma is heavily bourbon with some pineapple understones. In the glass the two mesh equally and a bit of floral hops lays beneath. The body is opaque and brown/amber in color. It had a head the size of a quarter, but only very briefly.  The fore is a blast of smooth sweet malts and bourbon...lots of bourbon. Oak, vanilla (combining to coconut) and the faintest traces of sweet tropical fruits follow. I want to know where these bourbon barrels came from. Tastes a lot like a a bourbon with melted ice, but the thick palate and smooth malt undertones keep it from getting too far down the road away from the realm of beer. Its a heady drink and I swear I get a lingering pineapple/ malibu rum flavor in the far aftertase. A sipper for sure.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"
3666,"2006-06-24",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 30, 2007 2006 Bottle: Deep cherry pour with a thin tan head.  The aroma is pretty raw - oak, vanilla and alcohol with underlying notes of sour cherry, cinnamon and plums.  Softly carbed, this has a velvetty mouthfeel that is a perfect vehicle the malty body.  Rich notes of sugary caramel, vanilla bean, butterscotch are in abundance.  Subtle whiskey finish is quite appropriate.  


Re-rate 08/29/07: This still displays lots of the notes listed above, but has developed a creamy mouthfeel and the flavors have really meshed.  This is really great.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

Light tartness in the aroma.  The flavor led to more coconut, bourbon and malt.  Light alcohol with a nice warming sensation.  It was more like drinking a coctail than a beer but it wasnt bad because of that.  Medium to full bodied.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"

Very smooth. Nice balance. Interesting old ale. This one will age and mellow nicely I think. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry and crisp.

3666,"2006-06-17",4.4,"Finishing up my little MI or almost MI brew sampling fest with myself.  And on top of that, hitting 450 rating.  Exciting.  Pours a really thick syrupy looking hazy brownish.  Nose is huge bourbon vanilla, with a cherry-appley bubblegum aroma that really makes this thing go.  Flavor is again bourbony, with a terrific mix of fruits and vanilla.  Overall, it goes down really smooth, even at 9.3%, with a really wonderful fruit-oak taste.   Im thinking on tap, just like its fellow Founder brews Breakfast stout and their Imperial Stout, on tap this is probably a 5.0.  But in bottle, Ill go 4.4.

It is smooth and very drinkable.  A style that gets overlooked IMO, which is sad.","Ohio, USA","redlem"
3666,"2006-06-17",4.3,"Bottle and served at above room temperature in my GL snifter: Poured a combination of mahogany and copper with a nice solid frothy slightly off-white head and very good lace. The aroma has notes of heavy caramelized sugary malts, vanilla and woody bourbon esters, raisin, prune, sea moss fresh from the bog, old aged hops, and a heavy NON-aromatic tobacco ester, NICE!  The taste is a smooth blend of the sweet malt base, sharp and quick to fade bitters, and a consistent oaky and tannic overtone. The vanilla, fruit, and bourbon character is there but never overpowers the basic brew, NICE!! Throughout the beer displayed two main central characteristics: 1) Solid toasted malt and 2) an Olde Ale upbringing that will served it well into aging. The mouth feel is lush and smooth, hidden vinous notes till the end. The alcohol nature should calm in a few months IMO.  Holy shiz, I dont know bout you all, but I found this ROCKED, ROCKED, ROCKED. Perhaps I am just a sucker for an outstanding Olde Ale and biased in that respect. So be it...the other bottles will not be for trade unless I buy more, which is likely the case...hum a case, that sounds about right.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
3666,"2006-06-14",3.4,"Unfiltered ruby-orange in color. Broken layer of foam settles into a tightly woven collar of dirty-white cream. Immensely aromatic notes of fresh-cut oak, perfumey tannins, raisins, rhubarb, and vanilla-infused caramel. Soft, densely packed bubbles grace the tongue. An unappealing arrangement of rhubarb and bourbon greets the palate. Bourbon is noticeably soft and composed, and also possesses a fair amount of cleanliness, but the tannins immediately weaken the bodys strength. An assortment of fruity esters lurks beneath the richness and lends a complementary slickness to the pungent oak. Tannins reinforce the medicinal astringency, but it stops just shy of becoming overbearing as its quickly muffled by the bodys plush softness. Hop impact remains minimal up until a hint of bitter grapefruit rind skims the tongue. Alcohol heightens as the flavors evolve, as do a body-reinforcing caramelized sugar and tannic tug. The pungency of the oak negates much of the soothingly soft malts, but a softened oak-derived vanillin sweetness is there to compensate. Flavors lose intensity at the finish, due to the heightening tannic acidity which leaves a trail of candy apples and medicine in its wake. The aroma has plenty of power, but not much allure, and the wood is too raw/fresh tasting and tannic. Had they chosen a barrel with a deeper level of toast, this might have been blissful. I must say, however, that the magic of bottle conditioning is to credit for the wonderful carbonic texture.  Not too shabby.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Initial flavor of caramelized sugar, vanilla, and oak quickly transitions to a  pronounced boozy, warming,  and astringent finisih. Hops really take a back seat in the finish. What was really weird about this that is goes down the throat so smoothly, like velvet. No stickiness. Not bad, but I did find the flavors and transitions fighting each other.

Whats lacking here is a heavy mouthfeel, and more candided fruit and spice that I might expect from an old ale.

Shared a bottle with a friend last night and we both concurred this is good, well need to get some more. StewardofGondor nails the aromas, but there is more in a less analytical sense. I do envision the sea port, with the scents of dock wood, soaked in sea water and fresh and even a hint of not so fresh cod swims about. You walk into the port saloon and The scents of english pipes, whiskey, strong ales and the thick perfume of the ""waitresses"" flow and cling to the nostrils. I really do think I was born in the wrong age.  Thick and lightly silky in feel. Sweet caramel, malt, figs, pineapple, coconuts all gather together an embrace the mild cask wood. The finish is light, with mild peat and a dry malt hint. Two brews in one night that would be perfect for fall or winters night. I really am not complaining. Ill take new ""good"" brews anytime.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
3666,"2006-05-06",4.3,"Bottle: Brown pour with very little head. Aroma has some serious alcohol sweetness, a little bourbon but not much. I really didnt pick up that it was bourbon aged untill I saw the editors note. There is some fruitiness and something that reminded me of a christmas beer that I couldnt quite place.  The flavor is quite sweet, with some mollasas/caramel, and some nice warming from the alcohol. It is very, very drinkable I found myself plowing through it pretty quickly before I remembered it was almost 10%.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
3666,"2006-05-04",4.7,"Fresh bottle.  Hazy and murky with a dirty ruby-caramel-brown color.  Big tan sawdust concentration spans the head, and weve got a thick, clinging tan wrung with lovely lacing tracts as we go.  Aroma revels in amarillo intoxication, melding longingly with sweet chewy amaretto nougats, a pistachio-pine combo, strawberry shortcake, cherry fig neutons with sugary single malt scotch injected into the fruit filling, cherry wax chews and bubblegum.  Hot flavor reservation seeps in seductively, mirroring and miring the aroma.  Spiced rum, banana-rye bread and a woody bourbon tract.  Peppery amaretto toffee chews and delicatessen Disaronno bubblegum.  Maplewood and gentle toasty accents of coconut aid sentiments of greased bing cherries.  Sticky palate persona, with the tongue melding to the roof of the mouth and then recessing to a smidgeon of palate numbing.  Gentle bitterness supports a huge malt bill with dead-on carbonation.  That bitterness and alcohol line the center tongue groove while whisky & rye and flame-licked oak bring out the finish.  This might be this brewerys best foot forward.  A masterful demonstration of complexity, and such an original work of art.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
3666,"2006-01-15",3.6,"On-tap at Pizza Plant Transit. It was so good it was as if it was brewed right here. Dark boddy with thin head. Stouty roast aroma. Hoppy and spicy. Medium-full body. I like the style, its more drinkable than a barleywine. The understated carbonation at this location does it justice.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
3666,"2005-10-13",3.6,"On tap @ the Brew Kettle:  Dark copper w/ a lasting off white head.  Alcohol, caramel and lemony hops with hints of roast fading in and out.  A little bit of Old Spice from the guy sitting next to me intermingles with the toasted malts that get stronger with warmth.  Well balanced with a dry finish for a big beer.  Caramel flavor, citrusy hop lingering into the finish and aftertaste.  Toasted and bready malts as it warms in between.  Moderate esters.  Aftertaste is toasted malt and citrusy hop.  Full body, lower carbonation w/ a well hidden alcohol. Very smooth.  Needs to age some for a true old ale, but very good and barleywinish for now, will probably improve with age.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"
3666,"2005-08-29",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2006 BOTTLE RATING: a fine brew, but a bit dissapointing for an old ale...too much bourbon, too little caramel...just way too boozy

TAP RATING 29 AUGUST 2005finally the curmudgeon has risen....a dark brown body (color of a chesnut in the light)...aroma is wonderful...full of sweet malts, grapefruit hops...flavor isnt quite as expected with an old ale...full of piney hops, some sweet malts, and a bite that is common in their Dirty Bastard and Devil Dancer...i agree with silphium as well...his rating is right on the money

3666,"2005-08-08",3.8,"Ive been seeing this on their website and posters on the wall of the brewery for a long time now, so it was finally nice to see it on tap.  Creamy head.  Deep brown/ruby color.  Pine sap aroma.  A little lighter in body than say, a Bells Third Coast OA.  Very palatable, tastey offering.  But, I agree with Silp in that this is nothing too out of the ordinary for this brewery.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AustinMilbarge"
3666,"2005-07-22",3.2,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2006 Bottled version, rated 3 May 2006.The ""official"" version of Curmudgeon Old Ale is finally in bottles, and has been given the bourbon treatment.  Sediment-laden orange-red body, thin off-white head.  Strong oak and vanilla bourbon aroma, with candyish sweet malts and alcohol notes.  The flavor is woody, leathery, and a hint salty, but the underlying malts are indistinct and merely serve as a sweetish wash on the tongue underlying the oak notes.  Theres a little bit of bubblegum on the palate that lends slight interest to an otherwise messy beer.  Oh, well.  Founders has mostly hits and a few misses, and, unfortunately, this is in the latter category.On tap at Founders after a long wait!  Deep reddish-brown body, medium cream head.  Indistinct aroma of sweet, candyish malts with hints of hops bitterness.  Served too cold.  Surprisingly bitter, piney flavor with rather nondescript sweet malts (hints of berries, cherry), caramel, and toast, but not with the intense focus on the malt bill as suggested in the official description.  The finish was bitter with strong grapefruit rind.  I expected a bigger caramely body, perhaps with raisins, prunes, or figs, but that was just a dream, just a dream, just a dream...in any case, this is decent sipping material, but, if youve tried their I2PA, Devil Dancer, and Dirty Bastard, youve pretty much explored the territory this beer navigates.July 2005 tap (non barrel-aged) version: 7-4-7-3-13 (3.4).","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
