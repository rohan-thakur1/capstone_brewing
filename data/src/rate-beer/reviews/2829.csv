2829,"2016-04-26",3.9,"5.6%ABV. Pilsner.

Tapped out slightly cloudy gold. 8ºSRM.

Nose is beery and rich with a thick wheaty,pale malt body. This is the aroma you expect when you are ready to dig into a pork knuckle.

Mouthfeel is carbonated and light. The palate almost disappears from you. Perfect for pork belly or a really fatty roast pork. The palate has some nice floral hops with lychees and Jambi Ayer on the palate. A very nice fiinish for a locally themed pils. Typically Mikkeller with a good rich grain bill of wheat and pale malts which come across as candy sweet but have a full sweet pale malt body.

Finish is brief with some nice fruity floral flavors wth lychee, Jambi, green mango and green papaya.

Food pairing: pork knuckle or or locally, some very properly done SIew yoke or roast pork.

Nice solid pilsener, with a hop-forward nose incorporating citrus, stone fruit, and grassy notes, with an almost vinous character. Unlike so many pilseners, the grassiness doesnt come across as limp or weedy - probably because its almost secondary to the CTZ-style tangerine and peach notes. The flavours are more traditional than e.g. To Øl Raid Beer, which for my money remains the best pils ever, but still solid and enjoyable. (14/20)","CANADA","UXO"
