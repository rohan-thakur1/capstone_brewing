4386,"2017-02-07",3.5,"On tap at KSQ. Deep deep mahogany, almost black, with a small (less than a finger) head and moderate lace. Aromas of caramel and roasted malts, with a bit of coffee in the background. Roasted malts, almost smoky, taste with the caramel and coffee in there as well. Slight berries in the background, all of which is balanced by the slightest of hops bitterness. Creamy smooth on the palate with a nice dry finish.","Pacific Palisades, California, USA","RedSox2004"
4386,"2013-09-15",3.6,"Draft at JBs. Pours a near black, dark brown, with thin tan head and nice soapy lace. Nose of chocolate, caramel, roast, pine and grass. Medium body. Really smooth malty flavor with some grass and piney hops coming through as well. Very little harshness from the malt, only mildly bitter. Really nice.","Pennsylvania, USA","tcane7"
4386,"2013-05-09",3.6,"Draft at liberty union. Pours black with medium sized tan head. The aroma has a nice mix of grass, roast, light smoje. The taste is nice and roasty with a nice hoppy kick and some fire in the finish. Very nice.","Spring City, Pennsylvania, USA","boxofrane"
4386,"2013-03-06",3.7,"This one poured a dark brown color with a beige head.  Aroma was lots of piney hops, light roast and some earthy notes too.  Flavor was much the same, lots of flavor between the roast and piney hops for a beer that isn;t that big. Interesting, but not really on style, more like a session black ipa.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
4386,"2013-03-04",3.8,"A really unusual brew. On tap at Fat Heads. Pours a brown color with a medium white head. A light nose of pine and sweet Pils malt. The flavor is rich bitter hops, pine, roast, chocolate. All in a pretty small beer. Good. Interesting and drinkable.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
4386,"2013-02-25",4.0,"Growler thanks to MrChopin. Deep brown pour. Nose and flavor bring beautiful dry roast, scallions, green hops, and spicy noble character. Gorgeous attenuation. Delicious.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

4386,"2013-01-31",3.3,"On tap at Victory last weekend.  Dark.  The nose is a bit of roast with spicy and floral hops.  Very similar to Braumeister with the addition of a bit of roast character.  Nice and crisp.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
4386,"2013-01-21",3.4,"On tap at Victory Brew Pub. Pours dark reddish black with tan head. Toast, earth. Mildly bitter. Smooth body. Not my favorite.","Wayne, Pennsylvania, USA","pilgrimoutlaw"

4386,"2013-01-13",4.1,"dark brown, thin cream head and ring. Dusty earth nose, heavy hay, light chocolate and roast. Victory pils flavor has lightly green cocoa and pine up front, mid of light roast, finish a bit sweet, not enough grain though small bubbled carbonation, soft yet spritzy and on point.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
4386,"2013-01-12",3.8,"Growler 1 day old thanks to MrChopin. Pours a clear, deep cola. Thick, coffee foam. Big retention and lace. Nose is grassy hops, hazelnut, whole wheat pizza crust, earth. Taste is dry, bitter, coffee, dark chocolate, waxy bitter chocolate bar. Really good. Palate is snappy, crusty, bready... bringing that Victory pils palate to a schwarzbier. Quite nice and very different. A special treat!","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
4386,"2013-01-12",3.9,"Growler courtesy of MrChopin. Bubbly black pour with a thick tan head.  Chocolaty slight roasty aroma. Tons of grassy citrusy hops. Lightly sweet chocolate flavor. Dry and bready with a bitter grassy hop finish.  The hops mix well with the roasty malt. Easy and drinkable.","Seattle, Washington, USA","EricE"
4386,"2012-09-20",3.9,"A: Pours an amber transparent color with a thin frothy white cap. This beer is supposed to be a hybrid of sorts, so the color is not meant to be ""to-style""

S: Lots of German yeast notes, grain, wheat, a urinal-cake phenolic-like note, and light earthy hops that make it floral. Not terribly complex, but very inviting

T: The hops give a solid bitterness, grainy, earthy, wheaty, and very smooth. Everything works well together, including the yeast. Not necessarily to-style, but very good

MF/D: Smooth feel to it despite the kind of prickly carbonation, the finish is of light grain and wheat. Body is lighter","Parkland, Florida, Florida, USA","scottyshades"
4386,"2011-10-02",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2012 A: Clear, muddy brown body. Healthy off-white head. Decent lacing and retention.

S: Grassy, resinous hops. A little different than expected. Some baked bread in the background.

T: Much like the nose. Grassy hops. Slightly smoky malts which was not expected.

M: Nice light-medium body. Nice bitter bite at the finish.

O: All in all, a decent beer, too many ""surprises"" for me made it a little tougher to get through than I would like in a pils.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
4386,"2011-03-08",4.0,"Draft.  Pours an orange body with a white cream good head retention.  Malty up front with light coco notes but quickly softened by a grass y noble hop tone.  A bit spicy in terms of the hoppy grass tones and some bitter resinous oily tones.  A hint of citrus and sharp finish.  Delicious.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
4386,"2011-03-03",3.5,"from the keg at Brewvival on 2/26/11.  light orange pour with a thin white head.  blended hop and malt driven nose.  medium body with a really nice bitterness layered over roasted malts... starts to enter the black ipa thing.  roasted finish with a lasting bitterness.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","craftbeerdesign"
4386,"2011-03-01",3.7,"On tap at Holy Smoke.  Pours a clear caramel with a medium sized white head.  Lightly floral, toast and malt.  Clean hop profile.  Malty, big noble hop flavors coming through, with some more light floral notes.  Nice big bitterness and toast.  Long tannic finish with toast and more hop bitterness.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
4386,"2011-02-25",4.0,"Tap at Blind Tiger. Crisp malty nose, lots of crackery malts, light honey, a touch of biscuit, and grassy hops. Taste is lightly sweet, lightly bitter, lots of grassy-lemon drop hops, firm biscuit malts. Very nice.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
4386,"2011-02-12",3.4,"medium brown with large white head.  Some bitterness with roast finish before a lot of munich sweetness before a touch of noble flavor and a dry finish.  Verall a bit sweet for a schwarz with far too little roast.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","joshwilfong"
4386,"2011-01-19",4.2,"Tap at RNH. Poured as the Victory braumeister Schwarz Pils.  Pours a very deep woody amber (not black or schwartz at all), clear, good lasting dense off beige head.  Aroma is intense spicy german hops, fresh grassy spice, herbal notes and almost sweet flowery hops with good full bready malts, pils, and light burnt toast with touch of sweetness- no roast, no chocolate to cover the hops.  Flavor is similar- big bready pils malt, light carapils, slight vienna breadiness, toast, and huge fresh green german hops, zesty and spicy near the end- with a great balanced malt-hop finish yet still incredibly drinkable.  Firm yet crisp.  Awesome stuff.  Best beer of the year so far.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
4386,"2011-01-12",2.7,"Draught. Pours v dark with slightly creamy head and red brown tinges. Not much aroma. Weird malt and grass.  A very odd one.","New York, USA","Maverick34"
4386,"2011-01-05",4.0,"Chestnut brown pour, beutiful foamy head and great lacing.  Flavor was some dark roasted malted flavor with a slight fruity zing.  Funky noble hop flavor.  This really worked for me.  Kudos to Victory...worth the trip to the brewpub.","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"
4386,"2011-01-05",3.5,"Deep copper pour.  Aroma had plenty of earthy hops and medium roasty malts.  Bitter like a hopped up pils but with a light roasted malt note, too.  Finish had a nice bite to it.  Not what I expected but quite nice.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
4386,"2010-12-20",3.2,"On Tap at the Victory Brew Pub, Downingtown.  Brown/Copper in color with a thin white head.  Bready, grassy aroma.  Dry, grassy hops dominated the tasting. Decent.","Pennsylvania, USA","nittanytide"
4386,"2010-12-19",4.1,"From a growler picked up at the brewery... into a pilz glass.  Pours a really nice auburn brown.  Tons of fluffy head and accompanying lacing.  Aroma of grass and more grass.  Mouthfeel is light and crisp.  Nothing like a schwartzbier but spot on for a pilsner.  Great crisp grassy and light hoppy taste.  Its got some bite/zing to the taste and aftertaste.  The dark malt is slightly noticeable in that theres a very mild smokey flavor but it works well with the hops for some reason.  Overall, an awesome pilsner... yet another in a long line by Victory.","Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","dagimp"
4386,"2010-06-04",3.6,"(Old BA rate - tap, BT 09)
Orangey golden brown color; with a generous frothy slightly off-white head; no real lacing, but OK retention. Hoppy; sweaty gym socks and musty; kinda weird here; light maltiness. Great hoppiness; slightly earthy; bigger malt than some others in the style. Nice stuff. Lighter to medium body; good spritzy carbonation. Really darn good considering the flavors as well as the refreshing and dry finish. Overall, this was very enjoyable","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"
4386,"2009-08-22",3.3,"Draught at TND:  Aroma of slight citrus, light caramel, light hops, light earth, and slight malts.  Poured deep amber/light brown in color with a small, creamy, off-white head that lasted throughout.  Clear.  Very sparkling.  Excellent lacing.  Flavor is lightly sweet and lightly bitter.  Tastes of Hellertau hops, grains, dark malts, slight rye, and pumpernickel.  Medium body.  Dry texture.  Average carbonation.  Hellertau hop finish.","King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA","michael-pollack"
4386,"2009-08-05",3.3,"Tap at Victory.  Pours a deep brownish amber with a medium creamy off white head that laced.  Aroma of
toffee, toasted bready malt and nuts.  Flavor toasted malt, bitter hops, nuts, bready pils malt.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
4386,"2009-07-21",3.4,"Loved this one poured a dark brown with a tan creamy head nice malt roasted aroma tasted like a pils very smooth with a nice spicy herbal hop very sessionable","Penndel, Pennsylvania, USA","italianjohn"
4386,"2009-07-16",3.6,"Draft at Victory, and the 2nd beer Ive been the 10th rater of today, after having that happen only twice in the last 7 years.  Pours deep brown.  Nose is earthy malt, some hops, dark fruit, and cherry notes.  Tastes malty, hoppy, with an earthy caramel note at the base, and earthy notes throughout.  Unique, but I think we need to classify that Victory called this a pils, not a scwarz.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
4386,"2009-07-13",3.1,"Tap.  Poured clear darkish brown, thin head.  Slightly spicy hopped flavor.  Light body, very interesting character building b/w the hops and the malts.  Tastes like what it sounds like, a schwarzy pils.  Nicely done.",", New York, USA","Gabler"
4386,"2009-07-11",3.3,"Tap at Blind Tiger.  Deep brown pour with almost no head at all.  The aroma is lightly herbal with a pronounced grassiness and a touch of cocoa as well.  There is a light spicy hop note but also a touch of soapiness as well.  The hops are quite pronounced with a fairly assertive herbal/earthiness.  The flavour never really seems to come out all that much though.  Fairly bitter with a kiss of roasty astringency.  Warming improves this really with the lighter zesty hoppy notes throwing a bit more complexity.  When its cold, all you get is a clash of herbal hops and cocoa.  Not bad, but its a strange one.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
4386,"2009-07-06",3.6,"Tap at the Blind Tiger. I was critical of this name, I figured it must be a schwarzbier and not a pils, but the name turns out to be highly accurate. Though there are light roasty notes and the beer is dark brown (not black), the flavor and hop profiles are unmistakably pils. Crisp, spicy, earthy, mineraly, this beer is a pils in everything but color. Some celery, stale bread, and stinky cheese notes are present in the aroma. Fun beer.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
4386,"2009-07-03",3.5,"Brewed in the USA...... On tap at the brew house. Pours brown in color with a super foamy beige head that dissapated pretty quickly. Aroma of dark malts, spices, musty funk and some hops. Taste is also of malts, hops, bread and spices. The mouthfeel is crisp yet kind of smooth and has a slight dryness at the finish.","Mt.Joy, Pennsylvania, USA","BeerGestapo"
4386,"2009-06-30",3.3,"Draft. Pours copper brown with a beige head. Light roast in the aroma, with a hint of sweetness. A surprising amount of hops in the flavor, with lighter notes of roast and sweet malt. Pretty good.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
4386,"2009-06-28",3.4,"On tap at the brewpub. Tapped a lightly hazed brown with a foamy off-white head. Smelled of spicy German hops, soap, and hints of nuts and roastedness. As with all of Victorys Pilsners hops were the feature flavor along with some toast, soap, and a slight metallic note. Has a lasting dry finish. Good but not as amazing as some of Victorys other recent offerings.","Mountville, Pennsylvania, USA","afireinside96"
4386,"2009-06-26",3.4,"[Draft @ EB+B] Poured a dark brown / amber color with a small, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of roasted malts, toast, toffee, citrus, and light floral hops.  Taste was bitter roast, hops, light citrus, some toast, and a bit of sweet toffee.  The roasted notes were a bit too much, considering the strong hop profile in this one.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
4386,"2009-06-22",3.5,"On tap at the Victory Brew Pub. Poured a medium amberish/brownish color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of toasted graininess.

4386,"2009-06-20",3.9,"1st rating brand new beer, tap at Victory.  Pours beautifal dark brown with a stable creamy head.  Nose is a little smokey and quite sweet.  Taste is smoky roasty, malty and pretty damn interesting.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
