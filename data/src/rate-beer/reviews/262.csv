262,"2017-05-26",3.3,"Bevuto freddo. La consistenza del liquido è limpida. Lintensità olfattiva è normale e la persistenza olfattiva è sufficiente. Il gusto al naso ritrova sentori di fruttato e di spezie. La prima impressione di intensità in bocca è di sake di media potenza. Il sapore tende pesantemente verso il dolce. Il corpo è snello. Lintensità gustativa è normale e la persistenza gustativa è sufficiente. Al palato il retrogusto è di media intensità. Il gusto è piacevole. Le sensazioni boccali finali sono di sake beverino. Il finale è di gusto dissetante e semplice. Laroma in bocca riporta sentori di vaniglia, pesca, melone e albicocca.","Milano, ITALY","labeerinthum"

Medium bodied, rather sweet initially, moves to a light bit of melon and rice again.  Very sweet, but never quite cloying.  Just on the edge of that.  Finishes up with a bit more light sweetness.  Easy drinking, but a bit more like an alco-pop than a sake in terms of flavor.  Decent enough I guess.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

The aroma was rice. The very nice crisp bubbly mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The very nice light fresh flavor contained notes of softly polished rice and mild rice.

Rice and yeasty-bread with sweet apple, pear and apricot. No real alcohol taste, unlike many sakes.

  I admit to being a Virgin on Sakes as far as Ratebeer is concearned.  At the same time, I think I found a good ""Cherry buster"" grading Sakes.  I have had a few Sakes before but nothing that tasted anything like this.

  It is difficult to compare this to mainstream Beers or even Cidars or Meads.  At the same time, I can see how this could be called a beer.  I think I have found a new road to travel in my research of great beers.  Welcome me to the world of Sake and be gentel.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","astrofrk"

Dry nose, watercolour paint, fine Manzanilla sherry; further peanut aroma and blossoms in the background. Very unsettling taste for a sake - or one I never experienced before - sweetish, with a fizzy mouthfeel. Imagine carbonated dry sherry, with an ever so slight adding of - rosewater, lytchee, raspberry or even soft lime. Unsettling, as I said. Quite fizzy. Original - not my favourite.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
262,"2008-01-14",3.6,"250 ml bottle from City Market in Burlington VT (January 2008) served out of the fridge from a White Winter Winery glass.  Fizzy, 7-Up sparkling, large-bubbled, clear, with bubbles continuing to flow to the surface for a few minutes after opening.....coconut-buttercream aroma, frosting, caky, sweet and delightful, perhaps a hint of sweet riciness....really sweet and candyish on the tongue at first, a bit like bubblegum, with some nice tropical/pitted fruit hints (peaches, coconuts, kiwi); dries out a bit in midpalate, with a sparkling, effervescent and soda-like finish.  Super-drinkable; I could probably pound back a 40 of this without thinking, alcohol is nowhere present, its like drinking a tropical Japanese soda or light sparkling coconut milk.  I find it pretty irresistable and tasty, if forgettable and quite simple.  If this were cheaper, it would become a regular libation for me I suspect.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
262,"2007-09-09",2.9,"UPDATED: SEP 10, 2007 This pours a creamy, off clear color w/ a spritzy froth that retreats quickly.  Bubbles the size of beachballs cling to the sides of the glass.  There are Champagne sized streamers present. This is odd. The aroma is slightly buttery w/ crispy sweet overtones. Light nectar w/ a persistant effervescence. This is a sparkling sake for sure. The flavors are moderately sweet w/ buttery nuances of melon, citrus, peach, vanilla, kiwi, pineapple. The finish lingers w/ a defined sweetness yet is slightly balanced w/ a mild tartness. I would actually drink this over a cheap Asti any day.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"
