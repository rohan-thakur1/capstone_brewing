5.0% ABV 
Milton LCBO Outlet #1 (Milton, Ontario, Canada) 
November 1, 2013 
The beer pours a translucent reddish-brown colour with a generous light brown head that quickly dissipates into a this ring. Aroma is roast, caramel, nuts, and weak earthy hops. Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with average carbonation. Flavour is slightly acidic and sharp. Roasted malt and caramel notes also apparent - but the acidic grab at the start does this in.","Milton, Ontario, CANADA","cyrenaica"
2181,"2014-11-20",3.1,"Bottle thanks to Sammy. Shared by me at weekly tasting. My 10th sahti tick giving me 10 or more rates in each style! Pours dark brown. Nose/taste of tree bark, juniper, pine wood and caramel/toffee. Medium body.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
2181,"2014-11-19",3.1,"Bottle. Brown pour with tan head. Malty tones. Lighter flavors, some sweet and woody tones. Boring, but not bad.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
2181,"2014-06-22",3.2,"I was given this bottle for Fathers Day. It may be snobbish, but Ive always passed on Trafalgar beers just for the piss-poor graphics on the bottles label. Its this headspace of if you cant be bothered to try with your label (looks like the owners teenage kid made it) how much effort are you putting into your beer? But always grateful to try something new, and maybe I was wrong. Cola-coloured and opaque, with a couple of fingers of tan head that breaks down to a sparse sheet. Nose of toasty malts and caramel malts. Taste again of toastd malts, smooth, with a weak berry and juniper flavour and a little wheat. Its alright.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Helsdon"
2181,"2014-05-26",3.0,"Pours a clear dark brown, practically no head. Aroma slightly of smoke and chocolate. Flavor is a match with a slight citric and earthy note, muted pine that is probably the juniper. A bit thin of body. So so.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
2181,"2014-05-18",3.3,"2014-05-14. Lightly hazy brown body, modest beige head fades. 3+ Aroma of lightly metallic malt, fruit notes are vaguely raspberry like, and juniper that I only define because it says it on the label. Flavour is relatively mild, lightly metallic dry malt base, fruit character in the middle grows into the finish and lingers with toasty lightly roasty malt in the finish. Average plus bodied palate, light carbonation. On of the better beers they have done in a while. Bottle from the LCBO, Toronto","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
2181,"2014-04-18",2.8,"Bottle 500 ml 
 Aroma:  aromatic, good blend of darker malts with juniper oil hints. Hined with cola at end.
 Apperance:  poured as dark brown with flat top. Rather boring.
 Taste/Palate etc.  medium lighter bodied. Chocolate , cola bourbon like feel . Rum and cola with slight bitterness. On top some brown sugar. Add some more body to it and it could be quiet decent. Chocolate with juniper heat at finish. Felt as it was unfinished, needs tweaking.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"

Trafalger - Northern Harvest Dark Ale.

Figured I needed some Canadian content. 

Clear dark beown pour with pretty much 0 head. Interest scent. Smells cooked. Roasted. Not in a nice roasty kind of way. 

Very distict taste. Easy to drink. Has that cooked burnt thing gong on. Sweet, berries. Burnt berries. 

Okay not really digging this one.﻿","Windsor, Ontario, CANADA","gilvanblight"
2181,"2014-03-01",3.3,"bottle. Poured dark brown with a skim tan head. Sweet and toasty malt aroma. Medium body, oily mouthfeel, lingering finish. Roasted malt flavour, a touch smokey with dark fruit and caramelized sugar.","Chatham, Ontario, CANADA","Strangebrewer"
2181,"2014-01-10",2.7,"pours clear brown, red tint, with a decent light beige head, some retention and lacing. roasted coffee, lean chocolate and nutty malts, faint fruitiness, maple, brown sugar, chalk, roasted acidity, pepper, metal, some burnt and very lightly smoky notes, minerals, few pine needles or other vegetal whatever. average carboantion, light body - so darn watery, short grassy-chalky-spicy finish. every component seems fainted, muted or watered-down. an interesting experiment (maybe) that turned out awkwardly bland and completely forgettable.

2181,"2013-12-31",2.8,"This ale poured a deep amber colour with a tan coloured, foamy/creamy head. Scents include ripe fruit, caramel and toast. First sip was very creamy with flavours of roasted malt and caramel. Med to low carbonation. Finish was malty with lots of caramel flavor. The bottle says made with juniper berries but???","Brantford, Ontario, CANADA","Tessic"
2181,"2013-12-26",2.6,"Light roast taste, nice light brown color, lighter than expected though for a dark ale. Not complex, but not bad","","Ikerr"
2181,"2013-12-22",2.9,"Pours a slight hazy deep amber with a frothy beige-yellow head giving a creamy collar. Spicy aromas reminding me of pumpkin ales blended with sweeter caramel malts. The Juniper are very mild in the background. Even in the taste, with more of the butterscotch base taking over, but still watery overall. Very light bitterness in the finish from the hops, caramel malts and hints of nuts. Not too bad, but feels like most of their beers. Watered-down and not blended as well as a micro should. Something is just off again.","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
2181,"2013-12-14",2.9,"Bière de couleur brune avec un col pas vraiment durable. Nez de malt grillée de chocolat et de fruits ce qui est un peu bizarre. En bouche le mélange est assez complexes mais il manque du corps et de lamertume. Mélange de chocolat café,malt grillée,fruits. Mon verdict finale est que cest une bière avec une bonne base mais il manque de travail...","Quebec City, Quebec, CANADA","cargo150"
2181,"2013-12-04",2.9,"A hazed reddish brown ale with a thin mocha head. In aroma, sweet nutty malt with spices, light ginger , OK. In mouth, a sweet wet dog malt with nutty notes, a bit light bodied, light peaty notes, faint spices, OK, good for Trafalgar.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
2181,"2013-12-01",3.7,"Poured a rich cloudy brown colour, with a lively head. Aroma notes are packed with spices, vegetables, junipers, fresh cut grass, and brown sugar. Tasting notes include spices, big juniper presence, pine resin, cough medicine, and some graham cracker malts to round it out. An excellent brew of moderate complexity!","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Canmoore"
2181,"2013-11-22",3.7,"A nice, malty, nutty aroma with some green, grassy, juniper notes. Lots of roasty, nutty notes, with some solid cereals. Really, quite a nice ale.","Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, CANADA","robinvboyer"
2181,"2013-11-15",3.5,"500 ml bottle from LCBO. Pours a lightly hazy copper colour with moderate-sized cream-coloured head. Aroma is lightly roasty with some chocolate, gently sweet berries, caramel and a bit of spiciness. Flavour has a nice roasty note, chocolate, caramel, light sweet berries, hints of wood and spice, and a mellow earthy bitterness. Average plus body. Medium carbonation.

2181,"2013-11-06",3.3,"Bottle from the LCBO. Pours a deep copper with a small tan head that quickly disappears leaving a slight lace. Nose is coffee and berries with some toffee, wood and vanilla notes. Quite sweet start but the bitterness balances this in the middle.Medium body with slightly soft carbonation and a short finish.","Newmarket, Ontario, CANADA","jksipa"
2181,"2013-11-05",3.3,"It has a strong coffee aroma. Opaque&light brown in colour. Its head isn?t the greatest. Starts off with a slightly sweet toffee taste and leaves you with a well balanced hoppy aftertaste. Light-medium carbonation. Lacing is good.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","cattaneopapa"
