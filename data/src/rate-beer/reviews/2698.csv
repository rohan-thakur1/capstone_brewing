2698,"2013-10-03",4.7,"Poured in a snifter during my visit to Founders.

Poured with a small creamy tan head with some lacing. Beer is very dark brown and very opqaue.

Nose is amazing. Good booze smell with some molasses/brown sugar smell. Maybe a hint of maple.

Up front a bit sweet with lots of brown sugar notes. In the middle some great nuttiness appears. The end is a wonderfully sweet maple mixed with the heat from the booze. One of most gloriously complex beers Ive ever tasted.

Medium body with low carbonation levels. A little viscous, but not overly thick and syrupy.

I usually dont like malty brown ales, but as with most stuff, Founders knocks this out of the park. If it were winter instead of summer, I probably wouldve stuck to this beer my whole visit. Its that good.","Indiana, USA","jmarsh123"
2698,"2013-01-21",4.0,"Pours a deep opaque brown with a small tan head that dissipates almost completely, leaving only a ring around the glass.Aroma is yummy! Bourbon, oak, cashews, and chocolate malt lead the way, with malted milk balls, vanilla, and maple revealing themselves later.Boozy bourbon envelops the flavor. Oak and cashews hit mid palate, with dark plums and prunes rounding out the finish. Toasted malt supports the flavor profile with strong flavors of chocolate and toffee that are fairly balanced with the bourbon. Maple sweetness really comes out as it warms. It really becomes cloyingly sweet and boozy.Body is fairly thick with minimal carbonation, finishing with a slight alcohol warmth.Overall, a tasty beer. I was hoping for less sweetness and more complex malt flavor. I think it would be nice to age a bottle and calm down the alcohol a bit.","","ianhuntley73"
2698,"2012-07-27",4.5,"From notes at Capones during PBW 2011.  Poured hazy brown with off-white head.  Nose was earthy oak, brown sugar, maple, cashew.  Tasted rich, very complex, with earthy brown sugary malt up front, and a delicious late hit of cashews, maple, and oaky vanilla.  This one was delicious.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
2698,"2012-03-07",2.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 8/21/2011.  Served on tap in a cervoise at the Great Taste of the Midwest.

My pours has a full walnut brown color with a light red tint. A small tan cap disappears almost instantly.

This aroma is supposed to be full of cashew, cocoa, and bourbon. Instead I get a very light tofffee and caramel malt aroma with a lot of ethyl alcohol. There is a little bit of cashew in the background, but I have to dig to find it.

The flavor has a little bit of maple syrup, some toffee and bready malt up front, then a touch of cashew, a little bourbon, and some fusel alcohol flavors. It is being generous to say this tastes like a boozy brown ale.

The mouthfeel is full bodied, with carbonation near the creamy end of the spectrum. The boozy nature of the beer warms the throat and stomach. A little bit oily, a little bit sticky.

This was the most disappointing beer I had at the Great Taste. I was really looking forward to this, and as the first beer of the day, it was a huge dud. It is probably worth trying again to see if this was a bad batch; I would never expected this from Founders.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
2698,"2012-02-13",5.0,"Cashew, maple, bourbon, caramel jump right off the nose and create a symphony of smell. Appearance was perfect, nice medium golden brown, heavy lacing, nice head and retention. Taste phenominal; one of the best beers I have ever had. Great palate feel, viscous without being too heavy. Overall, the only thing that could pose as a down side is that it was too easy to drink. I got blasted off this beer and almost missed Bells Black Note the next night.","","tsauce2"
2698,"2011-12-29",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2012 Had this at the blue dog. Wow.Alot going on . The carmel maple and booze hit the nose. The tastes keep maturing one after another and match the nose . Some fruit notes late alcohol hit and sweet hop aftertaste . You can go way wrong on the pallet with this much in one beer but they aced it. Add to you list of must try. ..on par with a great bw or russian imp.","","adamsvega"

2698,"2011-10-12",4.2,"Draft at the Blue Dog during Wealth of Riches. Poured a hazy brown body with a smalloff white head. Aroma is phenomenal with notes of brown bread, cashews, maple syrup. The body has a touch of alcohol heat over a medium body and strong carbonation for a barrel aged beer. Lingering aftertaste and a syrupy feel overall. Flavor of dark bread, maple syrup, alcohol and a hint of nutts on the end. Awesome stuff.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

2698,"2011-09-17",4.2,"The awesome aroma is sweet brown ale malts with dominant cashew in the nose, WOW!. It pours medium amber brown with a very light almost nonexistent head. The flavor is a sweet, nutty, boozy imperial brown ale with an almost sweet liqueur syrupy body. The maple notes help with the booze to round out this amazing beer.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
2698,"2011-08-16",2.9,"Draft at Great Taste. Pours a translucent brown with red at the edges and a fizzy head. Nose is pretty neutral, some cocoa and some faint mapley notes. A bit nutty as well. On taste, it fails because it is underbodied. With more mouthfeel, this would be a much better beer. As it stands, there is a faint cashew note and cocoa, but the abv is too high and the barrel seems to wash out the base beer. Needs work.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
2698,"2011-08-15",4.3,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a deep brown colored body with a finger-width, dense and creamy, light brownish beige head that dissipates slowly and leaves lots of lacing throughout. Gorgeous looking beer. Aroma is quite nice. Lots of nutty bourbon, smooth oak, sweet caramel, brown sugar and maple, a soft vanilla, a hint of roast, and a touch of chocolate. Excellent, well balanced barrel-aged aroma. Flavor is similar. Lots of smooth maple and nuts up front with a sweeter caramel and very nice bourbon-vanilla. Sweetness grows a bit in the middle with some oak coming in along with a hint of roast. Finishes very smooth and pretty sweet with lots of nuts, a pleasant vanilla-bourbon-oak, some maple, a few dark fruit notes, a touch of roast, and just the slightest hint of alcohol warmth. Very light bitterness that slowly dries and leaves a pretty lengthy aftertaste. Medium, very smooth and creamy body with a soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, an excellent beer. Great aroma and fairly sweet flavor with lots of nuts and a pleasant balance between the caramel and bourbon-vanilla-oak. Damn good.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
2698,"2011-08-14",3.2,"UPDATED: AUG 15, 2011 Draft on tap at Great Taste of the Midwest 2011 (Madison, WI). Pours a nice deep reddish brown hue, a light haze as a healthy glow gets through. A frothy small tannish head dies to a film, laces small. Aromas are nutty, some toffee, brown malts, bread, and toast. Some wet oak, vanilla, not spirity with a nice deeper dark sweet malt. Initial is earthy nuts, tobbacco, touches of dry barrel tannins, wet oak, toffee, maple and vanilla. Some toast, dry and nutty, caramel, a lot of toasted caramel, a bit hot abv wise but not from the barrel. Kinda a mess, with some dry boozy finish.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2698,"2011-08-11",2.4,"On tap at the Founders brewpub.  Pours a clear brown, minimal head.  Aroma of strong sweetness, alcohol, nuts, maple syrup, mild cocoa.  Flavor is horrendous.  Cloying sweetness, weird nuts, cocoa.  Tons of alcohol.  Slick body, heavy carbonation.  Hard to choke this one down.  Im disappointed.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
2698,"2011-08-07",4.2,"MBGSF 2011. Poured dark brown with a moderate frothy light brown head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted malt, maple wood with a small alcohol aroma. Full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation.

2698,"2011-08-05",4.3,"On tap at Founders in Grand Rapids. Big, luscious, velvety, nutty, oaky, sexy. Really a quality imperial brown ale here. The pour was pretty, with a big, creamy, lush, silky, deep cream head, and deep mahogany. A thick, yet delicate aroma. Wood and nuts are the main players. Also, rich toffee, sweet dark malts, a earthy/leafy bitter, and slight honey wine. All notes in the nose blend together nicely. The feel is thick and creamy, but more than that. More like rich, velvety smooth, with many strong, distinguishable flavors, and balanced just slightly toward the sweet side. Sweet, rich toffees, bourbon, nutty cookies, almonds, cashews, dates (sort of like a Lara Bar), other dark fruits, and earthy wood. It finishes with dark fruits, nuts, and creamy toffee. This was far and away the standout on a 3 state, 10 brewery, beer road trip. Really, really good.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"
2698,"2011-08-05",4.2,"On tap at Founders brewery.  Murky brown with a thin tan head.  Aroma of bourbon, nuts, malt, cashews and light wood.

2698,"2011-07-30",4.2,"# 2050.  On draft at Capones.  Pours a deep dark maple brown color with a medium sized light beige head.

2698,"2011-07-29",3.4,"Draft at Mi Beer Fest.  Nice brown color, light head.  Amazing cashew aroma - no question about this.

2698,"2011-07-29",4.2,"Sampled at the MiBG Summer Beer Fest 11. Color is clear brown with thin tan ring. Aroma is a beautiful mix of nutty cashew, maple, bourbon, oak, vanilla, caramel malt.

2698,"2011-07-23",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2011 On tap at Founders; pour is murky brown with a hint of gold. A beige head is present; though poured modestly from the barkeep; it does retain well in this glass. Sticky lacing is present as well. The nose is bourbon, caramel, toffee; another fantastic founders malt bomb. The flavor profile reveals the nuttiness; caramel, mocha, toffee, bourbon, and oak; its sweet and only lightly bitter. excellent!","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
2698,"2011-07-19",4.0,"Had this at the Broadripple microbrew Fest. First sip was an experience, cashew flavor comes shining through and is followed by a sweet syrupy molasses follow up. It was interesting for the first 3-4 taste then became cloying but overall an interesting beer that i was extremely glad I was able to get the chance to try. Maybe some of these brews will come out in their backstage series.. Keep up the great work.. Im soo glad I live in the Midwest!","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","hrking"
2698,"2011-07-09",4.3,"Draft @ Sunset Grill and Tap. Alston, MA.  Nice deep brown color. The cashew nut is intense and I pick up a bit of alcohol in the nose. Great taste of maple,  cashew with subtle vanilla from the bourbon barrels. It finishes with an over load to your palate.  I get sweet candied cashews,  maple, nuts , malt and the warming alcohol helps break up the sweetness for me.  Medium  Full body.  VERY enjoyable!  One of the best beers I had in the past year. Another solid brew from Founders.  I hope I can one day find this in a bottle or have a chance to get again on draft. Dont hesitate to try this.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2698,"2011-07-09",4.4,"Had this on tap at Armsby Abbey in Worcester MA.  Last glass of the keg so lucky me.  Pour is a rich brown with light head.  Aroma is amazing and is full of bourbon, caramel, light chocolate, and heavy cashews.  The first sip was a bit sweet and overly bourbony, but it really mellowed as it warmed and my pallet adjusted to it.  The cashews really shined through a ton in this beer which was a surprise.  Really a great beer and i hope they decide to make this one next in the bomber series.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"

2698,"2011-07-02",4.0,"Draft. Poured into a Snifter glass. 8oz for $5. Pours a dark mahagony brown color with a light tan wispy head hat collars around the glass. The aroma is rich but light with notes of molasses, brown sugar, nut, vanilla, and slight booze. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. The cashews come out pretty strong in this one and I am a little surprised as I had no idea they would be that strong. After the but flavor comes some dark fruit and molasses notes. Rich flavors. Alcohol warms the throat. Some nice spotty lace.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
2698,"2011-06-28",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2013 Had at Founders - served a rich brown-red color with about a half inch head. Aroma - Mainly got the sweet distinct bourbon aroma. Taste - Starts off with a sweet maple flavor, then progresses to the bourbon and finishes with the nutty cashew.  Granted I am not a beer expert, but have had my fair share over the years.  This was the most complex tasting beer I have ever had and was amazing.  It was because of this beer that I decided to open an account here just so I could throw my two cents out there.  Much better than many of the other high 90 and 100s at Bells, Founders and New Holland which I stopped at recently on a road trip.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
2698,"2011-06-27",4.1,"Draft at Jose Pistolas.

Pours a murky dark amber/chestnut brown color thats completely opaque with a  thin light beige head that quickly fades.  Minimal lacing left behind.

Roasted nut aroma thats bursting with cashews.  I cant believ how well the cashews are incorporated in the nose.  Subtle earthy oak, vanilla and sweet maple.  A touch boozy.  

Medium bodied but on the chewy side with a decent amount of sweet booze. The barrel character is strong but doesnt dominate the flavor.  A decent amount of earthy oak, vanilla and bourbon but the cashew nuttiness is perfectly integrated.  Slightly hot but abv well masked.  Complex and dangerously drinkable with lots of cashew sweetness, bourbon and vanilla.  Lingering sweet heat and warmth in the finish without burning.  Excellent.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
2698,"2011-06-17",3.9,"On tap at Jose Pistolas. Served in a tulip.

Pours a cloudy dark brown with a very thin off-white head. A thin collar for part of its unfortunately short-lived time in my glass. The nose has a lot of maple and a moderate amount of bourbon plus some light cashew character. The flavor brings a moderate amount of bourbon that is overlayed with a heavy maple character and a bit of sweetness. Moderate cashew and overall nutty character throughout. Creamy with some sweetness. Lots of nuttiness in the feel. Light booze. Uber solid. 

Overall, this basically tastes like candied nuts that have been dipped in maple syrup and have a dot of bourbon on top. Reminds me of the Bavarian Nuts at Plymouth, Indianas own Blueberry Festival. Thats a high complement. As it warms, some more toffee comes out, along with a touch of oak and a mild vanilla presence. Given that its a beer from Founders, Ill say Im not even remotely surprised that this is so delicious.

This beer is easily the most singularly unique, excellently executed brews I have ever had the heavenly privelage to sip. This is ambrosia, folks; nectar of the motherfucking gods. It tastes like a very mild, milk chocolate flavored cashew with hints of caramel and roast and toffee. It is medium bodied, playful, silky, smooth, and yet sturdy enough to suppopt the malt bill and the sugars. It finishes like a stunning brown ale; all malts and nuttiness. This nuttiness happens to be directed, quite purposefully, toward the cashew nut, and it succeeds with flying colors in every category. That was just from memory. Ill provide my notes tomorrow. Rest well knowing that you may one day taste this magnificent concotion. Surely, a sign of mans diviinity.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","patrickfannon"
2698,"2011-06-13",4.5,"A - Served a rich brown-red color with a finger of tannish frothy head. The head fades down to a think ring leaving behind lost of lacing.

S - The aroma is full of lots of toasted nutty and cashew aroma. There is also a lot of rich sweet caramel malt aroma and some maple and brown sugar mixed in as well.

T - Starts off with lots of sweet caramel malts and even more toasted cashew flavor. Though the middle, even more oily cashew flavor and rich caramel malt flavor comes through alongside some maple and brown sugar. The finish is a mix of toasted caramel malts and cashew flavors with some booze that lingers.

M - Full bodied with moderate carbonation. The beer feels very sweet on the tongue and a bit think and syrupy. The finish is very sweet with some warming from the alcohol.

He said that this was the first time this beer was ever put on and is the owner of founders favorite beer they make. Cashew Mountain was aged in barrels that previously held a little brew called Canadian Breakfast Stout and clocks in at a whopping 11%. Let me start off by sayin this beer a pure cashew in liquid form. One of the most unique and tasty treats I have encountered. Poured a hazy brown medium body with sticky lacing and small to medium light brown head. Aromas and taste of fresh cashews, mollases, chocolate, maple syrup, bourbon, roasted cashews. Finishes insanely smooth with a caramel coated cashew aftertaste. I can see why this is the favorite beer of the owner. And 11% is totally absurd for the way this goes down. Absolutely incredible and unique treat from an unreal brewer. Cheers!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
