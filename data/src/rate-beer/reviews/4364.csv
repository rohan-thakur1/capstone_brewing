4364,"2016-07-03",4.0,"However widespread they may be on an industrial level, lagers are, in contrast, still a rarity in the craft beer world. Jacks Abby proves that bottom fermentation has more possibilities than most would imagine and in this one, they have transplanted the hop profile of an American style IPA to a bottom-fermented Schwarzbier, thereby effectively creating the black counterpart of IPL (Pilsener with American hops), or indeed a bottom-fermented form of black IPA. Forms a thick, lacing, pale beige, creamy and very stable head over a black robe with chestnut brownish edges only in the outer millimeter or so. Lovely aroma showcasing both the hops and the malts, with impressions of toasted onion, grapefruit peel, pine resin, burnt toast, black olive, cold coffee, walnut, beef jerky, cold black tea, a vague hint of bitter chocolate and some naturally feeling iron. Malty taste from the onset, very low in sweetness, only malt fruitiness with beginning with a pleasant umami taste (cured meat) blending with a slightly caramelly but most of all nutty and toasted malt bittersweetness which turns roasted bitter in the end, including a low sourishness of roasted barley, with a very faint metallic edge; then comes the lush, aromatic New World hop character, piney, grapefruity, peppery, long, drying and still elegant, leaving room for the roasted and toasted maltiness to persist. This is a very pretty beer indeed and surely among the best lagers I had so far - I hope more of these bottom-fermented Cascadian (BIPA-like) beers will appear.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
4364,"2016-03-10",4.0,"Bottle. Nose is already much bigger than I was expecting, coffee, roast malts, hint of cream, hints of latte, touch of dark chocolate. Taste is roast, malty, hint of honey, toast, smoke, slight citrus and pine hoppiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is rich. 

Im very fond of a good German Schwarz, but Ive never really loved one before, this is a properly brilliant example, with subtlety and depth.","Greater Manchester, ENGLAND","Hanoi"
4364,"2016-02-09",3.9,"Bottle at home in CT. Pours rich brown with a frothy khaki head. Rich roasted malts in the nose, some cocoa, earth. Medium sweet flavor with hearty baking cocoa, dried tobacco, nicely rounded roasted malts, milk chocolate, a bit of scorched earth. Light to medium bodied with lively, massaging carbonation. Finishes with a richly dynamic chocolate character, more well roasted malts, cocoa, earth, leather, subtle dried berries, a little espresso. Excellent stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
4364,"2015-09-10",3.7,"Nice sexy presentation with solid black stoutiness and rich foamy head. Taste is very roasty and stout-like. Bitterness is entrenched in the beer like a stout would be-- Im not getting a pilsner type of hoppiness here. I dont drink many stouts anymore, so my interpretation might be off; but I just dont see the difference between this offering of Schwarzbier and a high quality craft-brewed stout. Maybe head to head I would notice the difference, as this beer would have less body. But when I see some call Schwarzbier the ""black pilsner,"" Im just not getting it here. This beer is not merely a black pilsner, but rather a light stout. There is still something to be said for successfully lagering a beer of this richness.","Rutland, Vermont, USA","canary dog"

4364,"2014-12-28",3.5,"Bottle: Thanks, Jeff. Pours black-hole black with only the darkest of rubies shining through the very edges. A foamy, beige head settles & fizzles quickly to a collar. Up front nose brings pungent, piney hops overshadowing a bold, roasty backbone. Criss-cross of herbal hops, ash, roast, leaves, grass, & a mild kiss of black pepper. Smells almost more like a ""Black IPL"" than a true Schwarzbier. Taste further confirms that notion. Brash, piney hops collide with your tongue first, over top a heavily roasted malt bill. Notes of bitter citrus peel, grapefruit pith, cocoa powder, ashy roast, burnt bread, a touch of roasted caramel, & herbal leaves. Sharp mouth feel, high carbonation. Like I said, this seems more like the lager version of a Black IPA, but either way, good stuff.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Taste is bitter hoppy, roasty dark malty, hints of dark chocolate, cold mocha, an earthy, resinous hoppy touch, some citrusy hoppy overtones as well, even a salty touch of liquorice.

4364,"2014-04-04",4.0,"The beer pours a deep, chocolaty brown with a massive head of creamy, sand colored bubbles. The head sits two fingers widths above the glass with a nice lasting retention and a puzzle grid of thin lacing. On the nose, the beer smells delicately of roasted coffee beans and damp pine forests. Smooth dark chocolate works its way into the nose alongside musty earth and subtle dankness. The balance on the nose between hops and malt is quite nice and intriguing. As I sniff for longer I start to sense oranges dipped in chocolate, which is quite inviting. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter with roast and hoppy bitters. The finish brings a splash of sweet chocolate and bready malts, and a pop of citric acidity also lingers in the finish. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet citrus lemon, quickly falling into bitter pine resin and decadently toasted bread, blending roasted coffee and espresso bean flavors through rich dark chocolates. Subtle grass and herbal hops work their way into the finish alongside a beautiful burp of milk chocolate and toasted oatmeal bread. The aftertaste is of moderately bitter pine resin, which sticks to the roof of the mouth. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium in body with a middling carbonation and a crisp, snappy mouthfeel that provides nice drinkability and scrubs away some of the heavier roast and bitter flavors. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left with slight spittle in the cheeks, soft bitter burn down the middle of the tongue, and a sticky resinous feel on the roof of the mouth. Overall, this is a beautifully balanced hoppy lager. Terrific pine and roasted malts tango on the tongue in a way that I very much appreciate. The closest thing to compare this to would be an American Black Ale, but this beer is miles ahead of that style in terms of balance. This could please a hop head and a roasted malt lover at the same time. Another superb beer from Jacks Abby.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

4364,"2014-03-17",3.9,"Rcvd in trade. Reviewed from notes.
The appearance has a black/almost brown body thats a bit lighter around the edges and bottom of the pilsener, three finger white foamy head lasts for about three minutes and slowly dies as it sips.
The smell has roasted malt, slightly pine/resinous, citrus perhaps (really faint), but gets more piney/resinous as it warms.
The taste is dry and bitter through the previously mentioned flavors.
The palate is about a light to medium, ABV is not felt leading to a decent session, comes through fairly smooth, dry bitter aftertaste and finish.
Overall, I would say this is good for its style and I would have another.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
4364,"2013-09-07",3.5,"Aroma of roasted maple malt and burnt pine sap. Dark brown with a two finger residual head. APA level bitterness for this lager, and of course plenty of semi-sweet toastiness. Palate cutting body which I found heavy but not exactly full like a porter would be. The hoppier the beer, the higher the RB score, as reflected here by a 99 style score. Bottled March 2013.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","Scrapersnbeer"
4364,"2013-08-21",2.9,"In short: A scented-coniferous hop orgy over chocolaty malts. A Schwarzbier for the Black IPA lover. Awkward perfumy hop profile that didnt work for me.
How: Bottle 500ml, consumed super-fresh a few days after purchase, bottle from lushawn but dont worry I disinfected the bottle.
The look: Clear dark ruby body topped by a large dark-beige head with good retention.
In long: The hop-forward nose is very coniferous, highly scented, a bit floral, and it all came together as almost perfume-like to me. Body is medium, plenty of soft bubbles, pillowy mouthfeel. In mouth the malts contribute a bit of flavor (slice of chocolate cake) but this beer is mainly a scented-coniferous hops orgy. Again that perfumy character. In a blind tasting, with the aroma and taste I would not have guessed this is a lager, this beer is so monstrously hoppy and with a hop bill that is so assertive that hops is pretty much all you taste. Very tasty but this was just not a type of hop bill that works for me. Can a beer like this be too fresh?!? I much prefer Jack Abbys more restrained creations. Given how much I usually love Jack Abby I was as disappointed as that time I thought I bought a ticket to see the greatest movie ever but it was a triple bill showing Transformers - Blow - GI Joe.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

It pours a dark brown with some orange highlights and a small khaki head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a soapy ring.

Pours a deep brown/black appearance with a spidery, dark brown head and nice retention. An amazing huge and potent, coffee, roasty malty aroma with some piney, burnt malty, a touch smoky, light citrusy aroma. Chocolate, uber roasty, burnt/smoky malty, spicy, very potent, piney hoppy flavor that finishes quite dry. Over the top, American-style version of a German classic, but quite tasty.

Nice big spicy bitter taste. Medium to bigger body. Lighter, smooth carbonation. More dry texture. Nice long roasty piney herbal hop aftertaste. Some coffee in the aroma, light hint of chocolate. This stuff is awesome. Puts a lot of Black IPAs to shame. Love it. My kind of aggressive, assertive schwarzbier, never had one like this.

4364,"2013-05-09",4.4,"50cl bottle pours a nearly opaque black with maple edges and some rocky, lacing, beige head.  Aroma is excellent, dry toast, dried cocoa pods, blood oranges, pine needles, dried lemon peel, a little licorice.  Flavor is sweet but only just so, light caramel, some dark chocolate, light fruit, some light coffee grounds, a touch of cola.  Far more citrus in the flavor, oranges, blood oranges, grapefruit rind, pine, soap.  All of it is very clean and meshes very well.  Finishes super clean, a little soapy but not overly dry.  If this was an ale it would be a black IPA, no doubt.  Completely drinkable.  Delicious.

A - Pours a jet black body that exposes some light around the edges. A few fingers worth of khaki foam sticks around for a while. Ungodly amounts of dirty, sticky lacing just coats the sides of the glass. 

S - Bright grapefruit, pine and charred malts and chocolate. It does that have uniquely Jacks Abby lager aroma to it. 

T - Not overly bitter or malty. Just pleasant piney hops meeting ever so lightly roasty chocolate malts. A touch of smoke on the end. Very clean and easy drinking. Mouth feel is medium bodied and silky.

4364,"2013-04-09",3.8,"Pours wall to wall black.  No color to be found.  Beige head.  Puffs up big with the initial pour.  Good lacing and retention.  Nailed the look.  The aroma is heavy on chocolate, molasses and doughy malt.  Some pine and citrus hoppiness in there, as well.  Theres more sweet roasted malt character than I expect from the style.  Its a pleasant aroma, but its more of a schwarzbier on steroids than a hoppy schwarzbier, at least in my opinion.  Im getting a fair bit of roast fruitiness.  Pretty rich.  Clean lager flavor.  The taste is fairly sweet and still quite rich.  Lots of fudge and treacle.  Big coffee and pine needle finish.  Again, over the top for the style, but still a very well made beer and quite tasty.  Im still not convinced that big hops and big roasted malt works well together, but this is a pleasant enough attempt, and Im sure fans of American Black Ales and whatnot will like this beer.  Very creamy mouthfeel.  A bit much for the style, but who cares.  This is a very good beer, and I would have called it an ale in a blind tasting. Knowing its a lager, I can bit out some of that clean yeastiness, but the hops and malt are too big for me to have guessed right.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Tastes of piny and earthy hops, common figs, black liquorice, burnt rubber,  ash, and plastic.Seaweed, algae, and walnuts too when let out to warm.
