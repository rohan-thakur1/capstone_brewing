2007,"2017-05-27",3.6,"Get Surly! Here’s what happens when substance meets smooth. This oatmeal brown ale defies traditional categories. Bender begins crisp and lightly hoppy, complemented by the velvety sleekness oats deliver. Belgian and British malts usher in cascades of cocoa, coffee, caramel, and hints of vanilla and cream. An easy-drinking ale with many layers of satisfaction.
Great tasting beer. Not too strong coffee taste. Dark in color. I would buy again

2007,"2017-01-21",3.5,"Danish pint from an actual pint can; courtesy of Rob G. Aroma: Moderate malts that tend toward nuts, chocolate and a little toast; very light citrus hops. Appearance: Translucent chestnut brown beer with a sticky tan head that settles into a thin ring. Flavor: Aforementioned malts and citrus hops at about a 60/40 split; citrus lingers lightly afterwards; the finish is semi-dry and lightly bitter.

A: Toasted brown coloration with a placid browned head. No legs to speak of, as youd expect from a 5% beer.

N: Lots and lots of coffee and oats. Has that graininess to the nose of beers from days past. Leather and pine accent the very bitter bakers chocolate. Very bready and toasty with a slight pecan flavoring.

T: Lots of roasted coffee and some toasted staves. Hops are noticeable, adding an earthy floor to the proceedings with a touch of pine and some grapefruit. Burnt caramel and bakers chocolate. More of the oats.

M: Quite smooth and light, yet it some how feels full, like eating a piece of bread.

O: An accomplished brown ale that rolls around the tastebuds and is deserving of the high ranking it has accomplished.Seems to me to be the kind of thing youd find yourself drinking in an English pub, albeit a quaff a bit hoppier and more forward than a bitter.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

Sadly, Surly is not distributed in Ohio: The beer pours a dark cola brown with a nice 1.5 finger head with solid and lasting retention.

A touch of spotty lacing trails throughout the session.Aroma opens up with some roasted malts and biscuit which are rounded out with some chocolate, toffee and caramel notes. Hints of oatmeal, brown sugar, vanilla. Grassy hop notes come through on the back end. Nice hearty smell! Spot on for this style.First thing I notice is a slightly nutty roasted malt taste; immediately followed up with a creamy oatmeal and brown sugar combination. Chocolate and roasted malts, some caramel, toffee, nuts, vanilla beans. Notable hop tingle on the finish, but this beer seems to be about balance and smoothness. Much more complex than typical brown ale.Bubbly, medium carbonation which lends to a slick feel.  Feel is smooth and creamy thanks to the oatmeal.

The pour is easy out of the wide mouth can. A full walnut brown color with a generous ruby tint around the borders of the glass. A frothy tan head forms initially, retains well, and leaves a web of lace down the side of the glass.

A lot of nice aromas here. The hazelnut is most dominant, but there is a burnt brown sugar aroma adding some sweetness, and a robust earthy hop aroma to bring a nice balance to it all. 

Toasted dark malt, caramel, burnt brown sugar and hazelnut are all present in the taste up front. The taste turns a little bitter, with a nice woody and earthy hop presence. There is a growing bitterness with each sip, but it never gets in the way of the other flavors.

2007,"2012-01-26",3.3,"Split can.  Poured a rich reddish-brown ale color, small off-white head. Aroma was mostly sweet, with notes of caramel, touch nuttiness. Relatively run of the mill.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
2007,"2012-01-25",4.3,"Serving type: Can  oh yeah!
Appearance: Poors dark brown with thick root beer float-like foam head.  Aroma:  Smell has a surprisingly refreshing lite hop aroma with some dark bread and chalkiness. 
Taste:  Great toasty sweet beginning with a bitter hoppy ending. 
Overall:  One of my favorite beers I have tried in the past year. Thanks to Lindsay from Minneapolis for bringing a pack for me to CHI.  I would love to try the coffee version of this.

2007,"2011-12-30",3.8,"16 ounce can, canned on date of 11/22/11.  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown (that you can see through some when held up to a light) with about an inch tan head that stays around a while.  Theres also a good amount of lacing.  The brew smells like caramel malt, vanilla, coffee, nuts, chocolate, and some light hops.  It tastes like caramel malt, nuts, coffee, chocolate, and some hops.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit slick and has moderate carbonation.  I think its a good overall brew, I liked it.  Its definitely worth trying.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

2007,"2011-12-19",3.2,"From can, yet another note from Dark Lord Day. Solid brown with a very thin head poured from half a can. Smell is quite alcoholic. Like a stout with all the bitter, roasty malt removed. This sample has gone a little bit flat. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for what this is. Tends toward malt with just enough hops to keep it from sweetness. Goes down quite easily.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
2007,"2011-12-17",3.3,"Received in trade from phisigben, thanks for the opportunity!
Pours a deep clear dark brown color with ruby highlights when held to light. A Huge fluffy beige head sits on top for a good long time before impaling itself to the sides of my glass. Smells of caramel and chocolate mostly with some vanilla, a hint of nut and a bit of earthy hop presence. Taste is caramel and toffee mostly. Hints of butter, alcohol, and a slightly earthy citrus hop flavor seems a bit out of place. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet watery mouthfeel. I didnt enjoy this one as much as I had hoped I would. The malt bill has a distinct English esb meets dark mild feel to it while it also seems heavy on the American hops for a brown. I thought the flavors clashed a little bit. For a brew with oats in the bill I would have expected a much creamier feel than this beer has.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
2007,"2011-12-09",3.0,"16oz can poured into a Surly pint glass, both courtesy of @ShawnBGP. No noticeable canning/expiration date.

1-finger light-tan head rests atop a clear reddish-brown body. Minimal lace, head dissipates quickly. Nutty, toffee, caramel aromas and flavors. Oats and reams of office paper also come across the nose. Reminds me a lot of Cigar City Maduro, but lighter in body and alcohol comes through more easily. Prickly carbonation. Hops are a little more pronounced as it warms and the beer leaves a dry, slightly metallic finish with a faint hint of pepper and raisin.

Overall I do enjoy this beer (second time having it) but Im more eager to try Coffee Bender. Maduro is one of my go-to beers here in FL and like I said, this reminds me of it, but I dont know if Id drink it as often were I living in MN.","Boca Raton, Florida, USA","brewkkake"

2007,"2011-12-04",3.5,"Can. Brown with a dark tan head.

A good beer but not great.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"
2007,"2011-12-04",4.0,"I received a 16oz can in a donation from a fan in Minnesota (thanks, Sean!). I poured it into Geordie Schooner glass.

Appearance: Dark brown color, completely opaque but with a lot of carbonation bubbles sticking to the glass. Forms a dark khaki, creamy head which retains and laces very well.

Smell: Slightly confectionary notes of the typical brown ale variety (caramel, toasted malt) with distinct flowery hop fragrance as well.

Taste: Where the line is drawn between a very hoppy brown ale and a Brown IPA proper is for the beer nerds of the world to decide and I think Surly Bender would be the apex of that argument. Really, this beer could go either way. It has a nice floral character and dry hoppy bitterness that complements the traditional brown ale qualities.

I was surprised when the first thing I noticed about the first sip was an overt, sharp bitterness. Its crisp, a tad fizzy, and a molecule or two of pine is detectable as well. The palate turns on a dime into a brown ale with some stout or porter-like qualities. Bakers chocolate, light caramel and nuttiness impart a sweet (but not cloying) balance to the palate. It finishes with toasted malts and returns to the original hop bitterness it started out with. Its really impressive how these flavors can work so well together. 

My only complaint would be that the hops seems to outshine the brown ale qualities. Surly Bender, in my opinion, might be more accurately classified as a brown IPA than a brown ale. The candy bar-like taste of the second half fades away a little too quickly. Still, the palate remains very satisfying until the end.

Mouthfeel: Perfectly medium-bodied with noticeable carbonation fizz. Hops linger for a moment or so, but is otherwise a clean aftertaste.

Drinkability: Im shocked that Surly Bender is only 5.1% ABV as it has the sheer energy and weight of a stronger brew. Not that one drink will fill you up or gets you drunk, just that its amazing its able to do so much on a lighter scale. Not sure if I would session this as the hops would become annoying, but itd be a great choice to have with a hearty meal.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

2007,"2011-10-04",4.2,"Ported from BA.

Appearance:
Brown, would be clear if you could see all the way through it. Amber around the edges. About a finger of just barely off-white head that dissipates after a bit.

Smell:
toasted malt and a bit of coffee. Slightly sweet and no bitterness. There are some oats there too, and caramel aromas.

Taste:
Again, toasted malt. a bit drier than the aroma, but still has some caramel taste and oats. No bitterness at all, very earth. Doesnt taste boozy.

Mouthfeel:
Thick and full, a bit chewy, probably thanks to the oats. Coats your mouth and lingers in the most delicious way.

Drinkability:
Very high. This is my go-to Surly beverage. Easy to drink a few of these, and you dont feel like you need a change of pace. Simply put, this one is fantastic.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

2007,"2011-02-06",3.9,"Cans from CLevar.  Thanks!  The first thing I noticed was the pronounced hops (for a Brown Ale) and a toasty quality in the aroma.  Pine hops, toasted grains, nuts, and caramel consist of the scent.  Dark brown color with some amberish highlights and a thin tan foam on top.  Light retention and the lacing was spotty.  The flavor continues with that toasted character from the aroma.  Nutty, with some bitter hops for balance.  The body is slick, sweet, and slightly creamy with a good caramel malt foundation.  After about half of a can I start picking up light vanilla and chocolate notes.  Very solid stuff.  The flavors are tasty and this stuff is incredibly drinkable.  Brown Ales are not necessarily boring anymore!","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

Pours a very dark ruby red/chestnut brown color with deep mahogany edges when held to a light source and a thin foamy tan head that quickly fades into a thing lasting ring. Minimal spots of lacing left behind.

The aroma is slightly bland and for me the least impressive characteristic of this beer. Plenty of malt in the nose with hints of oatmeal, chocolate, toffee and caramel.

Surprisingly hop forward that adds some crisp bitterness up feot balancing out by the mellow chocolate malt center. Slightly roasty with hints of bread, toffee and nut as well as a slight lactic creaminess. The bitterness lingers throughout into a roasty dry finish but this beer is very well balanced and easy to drink.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

2007,"2010-08-01",3.6,"Dressed in brown, he sports gorgeously deep garnet and ruby hues while a soft khaki head floats in suspended animation. A couple swirls and lace decorates the sides of my glass. Holding my glass to the light, he has an old sheen such as one would expect from wood time-tested and worn yet still full of rich beauty and wisdom. His nose is all about molasses and caramel while in the background pine trees flourish and grapefruit tantalizes. I grew up in the citrus industry, surrounded by the wonderful delights of differing grapefruit varietals so for myself at least, grapefruit is a tasty treat indeed. Vanilla bean and licorice mingle well with his sweet side as brown sugars melt under my adoring gaze. For his nose at least, his malty side impresses first before smoothly stepping aside to allow his hops to shine. My first quaff isnt the least bit tentative, and I am met by a creamy mouthfeel which coats the lips and pleases the tongue with fresh molasses and caramel. Im talking natural here, no saccharine artificial sweeteners here; this is the real deal. Weaving in and out of his sweet side are melted brown sugars along with faint esters of vanilla and licorice. Pine needles prickle and grapefruit exudes self-confidence from the middle of his palate all the way through a long finish. Pine resin adds to his sticky mouthfeel while grapefruit sports acidic juices and bitter skins. Furthering our journey down canned beer lane, I detect a quick kiss of cherry tartness in the transition between sweet and hoppy. A few more generous quaffs and both can and glass are empty, a sad occasion one would not guess by the merry smile glued to my face.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

S- A bright citrus hoppy scent comes through first. This is followed by roasted chocolate and caramel malt accented with a touch of vanilla and toffee sweetness.

T- The flavor initially has a big citrus hop accent but a nice balance of caramel and chocolate malt can be detected in the background along with a hint of vanilla. For the finish a bit of hop and roasted malt bitterness comes through but is balanced by the ever steady flavors of citrus hops, vanilla, and caramel malt. What lingers is some citrus hop flavor along with a subtle hint of everything else going on.

P- Medium tingly carbonation and a medium weight body. Body is smooth and a good amount of hop oils can be detected.

O- This is an awesome brown ale. One of my favorites so far. Reminds me a lot of Terrapin Indian Brown. Great hoppy characteristics accent a nice, complex brown ale with a good mouthfeel. Would trade for this again; though it is similar to the Terrapin which is locally available. Drinkability is great and ABV is undetectable.

As far as flavor goes, the pine hops dominate -- while not overpowering, they could be balanced by more malty flavors like the coffee and chocolate. Still, the drinkability factor cannot be discounted, and it seems as though the brewers want an easy-drinking beer over a robust beer. Subtle, yes, but the ""subtlety"" strikes me as more a lack of substance than it is truly subtle. Goes down nice and oily, rather slick, which coats the mouth with a bitterness, and the bitterness becomes too much. A nice start, but some refinements are needed here.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","joechristenson"

Drinkable, sweet, and balanced, just lacking some nuance.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

Creamy body tastes of coffee, mild hops, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, oatmeal - reminds me a bit of a tootise roll.  A little citrus in there too.  Perhaps a hair thin and contains a touch of sourness and mild bitterness on the back end.  Someone forgot to mention to this beer that its a brown ale.  Low expectations going in based on style but this was solid.","Oak Creek, Wisconsin, USA","esjaygee"
2007,"2009-12-13",4.2,"Bender is a very, very dark brown beer. The head is a coffee-stain color and bumpy around the edges. It smells like chocolate milk as well as oats, mmm. The taste is really, really good but I cant liken it to another flavor. The mouthfeel is very smooth. I dont usually like brown ales but this one is a standout beer. I also really like the 16 ounce cans Surly uses, nice.

The flavor is light on sweetness but still has a nice toasty, chocolatey and lightly roasty malt component with a medium grapefruit peel bitterness that is mostly in balance with the malt.

T: Again, this is all about the malts. Very nice blend of the roasty and chocolate malts. The earthiness from the hops helps the beer to finish slightly dry, with a small bitterness.

M: Silky smooth mouthfeel from this medium body beer. Very light carbonation.

D and overall impression: Drinkability is high, given the low abv and the tastiness of the malts. Overall, this is one fine beer. Just a great example of how malts can be used. If all other Surly offerings are as nice as this, I cant wait to try more. Skal.","Estero, Florida, USA","gtreid"

Pours very dark for a brown ale. Really super nose of carmelized sugar and roasted oats, plenty of chocolate malt.

I had to make an emergency run to the sink because the beer overflowed my glass. Aroma is very simple a bit of sweet cocoa, some hops, and a bit of oat malts coming out. Taste is hoppier that I expected which gave a few extra points but largely this beer was very simple. Caramel and a bit of chocolate come together for a weird mix then you get blasted by hops which was a crazy change and maybe does more harm than good. I dunno this was just ok, just brew your average ho-hum brown ale and double the hop profile and youll have Bender. Ill be honest I hate Brown Ales, they just suck. This being said this was probably the best one Ive ever had but it  still isnt that great of a beer and Id rather have many more others than this one.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","rayg1"

Smell is of roasted malts, oatmeal, and a bit of coffee.  There is also a subtle brown sugar or molasses sweetness.  Smells are all very subtle and the nose is not overpowering.

This flows into a coffee and oatmeal taste that gives way to the hops which are much more present than in the aroma.  The finish is crisp with a slight hop bitterness.

Pours deep brown with a moderate off white head. Aroma is strikingly hoppy, which is quickly overtaken to bittersweet chocolate and burnt caramel.

Recieved this in a recent trade with mully, thanks Matt! Bender pours dark mahogany, bordering on a dark brown, that glows when backlit. The craggy beige head grew to a finger on the pour and left good lacing on its way down. 

Big aromas from a lower abv brew. Big whiff of brown bread off the bat followed by a touch of rye like spiciness. Coffee, caramel and a swirling of vanilla join the party and make for an interesting brown. Mildly spicy fruity hoppiness toward the back. Lots of complexity in the nose!

The flavor mirrors the aroma nicely. The only difference I come across is a (more than the nose suggested) generous hopping that are all at once fruity and spicy. I even get a touch of that leathery goodness found in some other brews. This is an exciting brown ale and I dont think Ive ever said that before.

The oats add a nice creamy texture that really helps this beer stand apart. Medium bodied and incredibly smooth.

The drinkability is way up there. The low(er) abv and big flavor make for a great session beer.

Another home run from Surly! This is an exciting, delicious brown ale. Keep it up over there guys.

2007,"2008-02-16",3.9,"Pours a nice dark brown with a tan head. The aroma is thick with malt, vanilla, toffee and oatmeal. The flavor is very nicely balanced with a good amount of malt sweetness, coupled with lots of vanilla and a very pronounced velvety oatmeal flavor. That oatmeal smoothness carries over very nicely to the palate, lending the brew a very smooth mouthfeel. Overall another great brew from Surly.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","crowderm"

Delicately sweet, medium bodied, and fairly smooth. Tasted of milk chocolate, nuts, subdued flowery hops, light raisin, and a touch of caramel. Yum.

2007,"2007-12-06",3.6,"Tap, at 331 Club, NE MPLS.  Medium dark pour, slight head.  Somewhat minimal.  Rather toffee, chocolate like sweet smell.  Very slight, yet not too intense.  Smooth finish reminiscent of a nutty ale.  Delightful for a brown ale yet not as much so as a nut brown.  Probably because of the creamy,  almost coffee and half and half like finish.  Definitely better than your average tap beer.  NOTE: Ive been drinking old style all night because of my lack of funds for working at a liquor store, but I was able to afford at least one decent beer tonight.

Perhaps its the oats that give this beer so much character, but theres a real smoothness and heft to it, not so much from traditional malting (at least that doesnt seem so prominent in the taste) as from chewy, biscuity qualities. Nice liveliness from some hops too, with a sweet bourbon-like finish.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

This brew poured a deep, dark mahogany color with a frothy tan head that quickly faded down to a thin layer of lasting bubbles.  Just a touch of faint lace was left around the glass.  The aroma of the beer was mildly roasty and made up of milk chocolate, caramel, and also some light vanilla notes.  The flavor included oats, caramel, cocoa, and lightly roasted malts.  Also a hint of chocolate, finishing up lightly bitter.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and creamy with a nice dose of tingly carbonation.  An excellent beer with a wonderfully balanced flavor.

2007,"2007-10-17",4.4,"16 oz, can.  I would have tried this much sooner, but beer in a can makes me hesitant. I however over came my narrow minded snobby view of beer in a can and gave her a whirl.   Bender is dark brown with a red hue, and has a nice caramel-colored head that slowly fades. It has a slightly sweet chocolate/coffee aroma with a little hop in there.  The flavor is very well balanced and much more complex than I was expecting. The complement of flavors that danced across my tongue was chocolate roasted malt, caramel, and a little bit of nuts. There is a slight hop in the middle that adds the right amount of bitterness to round out the smooth, long lasting finish of this excellent brew.  The body is medium to full and feels creamy and substantial. As I drained the glass Bender left small tracks of lacing, which didnt last long because I poured another can of Bender into the glass.

Theres a decent off-white head that quickly dissipates to a thin, patchy film.  Small amounts of spotted lacing dot the glass.  The aroma is of dark roasted malts, burnt caramel, cocoa beans, and the slightest hint of dark rum.  The flavor is very malty up front, with caramel and cocoa showing strong.  Theres also a bit of oakiness and some lightly smoky, Scotch Ale type flavors.  A decent amount of herbal hops add a nice bitterness that balances this brew almost perfectly.

2007,"2007-08-22",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2007 Can from brewfiend, poured a dark brown-mahoganey color with a 0.5cm thick head, thinning fairly quickly to a thin covering. The lacing was decent, though, spotty rings all the way down. The aroma was roasty cocoa, caramel, and bubblegum. The flavor was rather porter-like, roasty to slight ashy dry chocolate, some caramel, slight bubblegum, lactic/milky notes with warmer temperatures, finishing quite silky dry, much like an oatmeal stout would. Upon reading the description a few minutes later, indeed, the oatmeal wasnt just an impression, its really there, neat stuff. Certainly, this beer defies a brown ale or oatmeal stout style, could certainly be an oatmeal porter in my mind. Mouthfeel isnt as fully as that achieved in an oatmeal stout, but the oaty dryness and silkiness is indeed there. Good stuff, Surly, and thanks much, Brad! Re-rate of second can at the end of the month: Not much of an opinion change: oatmeal porter, firm roastiness more noticeable this time.","","User37895"

I found this beer to be rather good, but I didnt find it to be spectacular.

It pours a dark brown with striking blood red hues as light dances through it.  Bender has a somewhat scarce but pleasing light tan head composed of inconsistently sized bubbles.  Aroma is a pleasing but understated caramel and toffee smell with some alcohol esters.  Flavor is pleasingly sweet and roasty, but with a bit of a watery mouthfeel which seemed to get stickier as I drained my glass (and as it got a bit warmer).

Quite good.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

Notes of caramel malts, brown sugar, oranges, grapes, grapefruit pith and nuts. Lesser scents of roasted grain, cocoa powder and very mild coffee with sugar round out the aroma. Alcohol is not detected. The flavor expands a touch on the roast and coffee notes, still fruity and mildly hoppy. Sweetness is medium to medium-high, acidity is medium, bitterness mlid to medium. The mouthfeel is fantastically creamy, medium bodied, with high carbonation and a smooth and rich texture. Finishes dry, lightly to moderately bitter, roasted coffee and sugars lingering for a short while, caramel lingering on.

Theres a round relatively sweet malt and a slightly dry chocolate character.  A bit of hops strikes me as slightly out of place, but still nice.  A bit thin on the tongue, though not watery, this has certainly been filtered fairly well and force carbonated, but since its in a can, I cant make off for that.  The flavor is a step above.  A round balanced dark malt bill complete with chocolate and hints of the caramel and vanilla they claim should be there.  The hops are above and beyond what I expected, but fitting and welcome.

While it doesnt rock my socks (lets face it...its difficult for brown ales to rock anyones socks unless the malt character is extraordinary), it doesnt make any real mistakes either. For my tastes, its just a bit too sweet, slightly overcarbonated, and the aroma doesnt really make an impression. Definitely above the curve though.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2007,"2007-06-26",3.6,"16 oz can shared with willblake thanks to allendodd. Pours a deep dark ruby brown with an average head. Aroma was sweet roasted malts like a funky chocolate covered cherry, reminded me of Reaper Ritual Dark Ale. Thin body that seemed almost a little watery, I might have expected more from the darkness of the beer. Flavor was nice with some malt notes and hardly any bitterness.

2007,"2007-06-15",4.2,"Pours with a four finger thick, lightly brown-tinged, tan colored head that sits atop a dark amber brown colored beer that shows a brilliantly clear, ruby hue when held up to the light.  The aroma is richly aromatic with notes of sweet, concentrated fruit, dark malts and hops; dissecting where each of these start and end might be a bit of work though as the aroma is quite well integrated.  Notes of raisins, perhaps some vanilla accented cherries, some berry notes and even some sweet citrus peel aromas mix with notes of toasted malt, browned biscuit-like malt, caramelized grain sugars and a huge toasted, dry, soda cracker note in the finish.  A fabulously aromatic brew, this really has such a well integrated, loudly aromatic nose; this is an example of why I like a well made brown ale; there is not so much dark / roast malt that it dominates the flavor profile and the simple (though certainly not simplistic) malt and hop notes are able to shine through as well.  Somehow there are notes of vanilla and spicy oak in this beer (and they are quite noticeable halfway through this beer); I dont know how they got here, but they are a welcome addition that add some additional complexity to an already great aroma.  Unlike many beers, where the aroma fades as you start drinking the beer, the aroma here actually gets better and more complex as you work your way through it.  Definitely dont forget to continue to stick your schnozz in this brew in between sips.

Sweet malt flavors encapsulate the palate and actual cling to my mouth almost like a much bigger beer would.  Fruity notes of raisins and sweet, ripe berries mix with an interesting, almost vanilla like note.  Some dark malt notes are noticeable from the get go; actually just a hint of roast character mixes with the hop character, both of which contribute a solid, though not in any way dominant, bitterness.  This beer is really fairly sweet and fruity tasting, that is probably the distinguishing characteristic.  It does not make this thick, cloying or not quaffable though as this is definitely a fairly sessionable brew.

Have I said how much I love great beer in a can.  Well I do, imagine how much easier shipping would be if the norm was craft beer in a can; still I do find the champagne cork finish too perfect for certain styles of beer.  This is a great brew, I really like the aromatic complexity (especially the surprise oak-like aromatics) and the flavor aint half bad either.  The oak notes even start to creep into the flavor of this beer towards the end of my glass.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2007,"2007-05-16",3.9,"Ah, the $205 glass of beer. I wouldnt have had a chance to try Bender, but for missing a flight to NYC (and $100/each in fees for my wife and I to get on a later flight.) So with an hour suddenly free, I remembered that Surlys website mentions that you can get Bender at Ikes in the airport, so off we went. It was really fun that even the 60-something waitress there also knew they had Surly, and was happy to talk about this exciting new local brewer.

Flavor is surprisingly dry and hoppy up front, with notes of earthy grassy hops.  Flavor shifts a bit to a light fruitiness with a bit of molasses... not as chocolatey as the can advertises, but more reminiscent of a doppelbock.  In fact, as I drank this, I couldnt help but wonder how close Id come to the taste if I mixed a slightly above-par session IPA with a decent doppelbock.  The sweetness came out more as it warmed, adding layers to the complexity.  I imagine that if I had drunk this cold, I would have gotten nothing but dry bland hops.  Became very complex and tasty as it approached room temperature, but the somewhat one-dimensional introduction to it I got when I poured it at cellar temperature kept my overall impression only mildly above par.

Begins with a salty sea oat sweep and then slides into a coarse and grainy tooth of grain, orange peel, toasted almond and sweet honey. The oat brings in great character to this brown.

A bit of graham cracker and cookie dough support the malt aroma nicely.  Light to medium bodied, silky smooth mouthfeel.  Soft on the palate, but not overly chewy.  The malt character is much stronger than the aroma let me believe.  Plenty of toasted bread crust, hazelnut, and a hint of unsweetened bakers chocolate give this a refreshingly dry palate.

2007,"2007-02-26",4.0,"16 oz can, via joebrew.  Pours a clear brown colored body under a smallish brown fizzy head that faded to a patchy film.  Some sticky lacing remained.  Aroma is nutty and lightly roasted malts with a nice balancing hoppiness.  Some chocolate, light alcohol, a little fruitiness, and a touch of vanilla.  Very nice substantial flavor for a usually boring style.  Lots of nutty grainy malt with a slightly roasty accent up front.  Moderately dry finish with a nice lightly bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, fairly dry with moderate soft fizzy carbonation.  Almost creamy in texture.  A damn fine Brown Ale.  Never thin or watery and had enough hops to make itself stand out among the crowd.  This is my highest rated Brown Ale, and it deserves it.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Aroma  does have a distinct caramel and vanilla scent.  Taste has the nut toffee and nice touch of bitter hops. S Surly Brewery sells both pint and tulip glasses.

2007,"2007-01-26",3.8,"Ive been wanting to try some Surly brew for awhile now.  I guess I didnt realize that it was canned, but thats okay.  After all, its ""Beer for a glass, from a can.""  I think the can factor adds a bit of uniqueness to it.  Im pretty open-minded anyways and always enjoy something different...  Bender is just about the color of Dr. Pepper (dark brown with ruby highlights).  It has a puffy caramel-colored head that slowly fades to a similarly-colored veil.  There is some scant lacing.  The aroma is like chocolate cake with a nutty and earthy quality to it.  The flavor is roasted malt, nutty caramel, and some cocoa and slightly burnt in the finish.  There is also a mild to moderate bitterness and a slight sourness (part way through) in the finish that balances the sweet, earthy flavor well.  I think that the finish and lasting flavors are actually better and more impressive that the initial flavor as are the final few sips with the hop sediment to give it a little extra kick.  The body is medium to full and is soft and creamy on the on the palate (must be from the oatmeal used).  Overall I think Bender is a really nicely done brown ale thats pretty comlex for the style and is  probably one of the better ones out there.  No harm done with the can either.  Very good stuff all around!

2007,"2006-12-19",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2008 Original rating, 12-19-06: 16 oz. can. The aroma is strong, hoppy, yeasty, and complex. It smells like a much stronger beer, perhaps a barley wine, imperial stout, or Belgian strong ale. It pours a dark mahogany brown with a red glow and a large amount of fluffy, tan head. The delicious flavor contains bitter coffee, chocolate, and roasted nut notes. The taste reminds me of that of the classic Samuel Smiths Taddy Porter. It also has a good, bitter aftertaste. This medium-bodied brew is crisp and lively in the palate and quite drinkable.

<P>I first drank this beer at the Happy Gnome in St. Paul, MN. The other beers I had that night were Rochefort Trappistes 8, Bells Two Hearted Ale, and La Trappe Quadrupel. Surly Bender more than held its own against this stiff competition.

<P>This is a superb, genre-defying, and unforgettable beer. Surly describes it as an ""oatmeal brown ale,"" and thats an apt characterization, but in the end it tastes most like an interesting, excellent porter. Bender is an exciting product from what is quickly emerging as one of Americas great microbreweries. Good work, Surly! Keep it up!

Appears a slighty hazy(though still transparent), dark brown with a mild red hue. A rocky, tan head slowly quickly fades out and leaves scattered spots of lacing around the glass.
The smell is yeasty, toasty nuts, fruits, grassy, light caramel, brown sugar, cocoa, and a touch of clove like spiciness.
The taste is of the mentioned aromas with perhaps a touch of mild sourness picked up, along with an astringency that is noticeable.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied, mildly roasty, with cocoa hanging on the palate leading to a gentle bitterness.

Standard brown ale stuff, but a notch or two higher on the richness scale.  Still, I had the version in the can, and it annoys me that I cant figure out if the metallic nature of this is from the can or the beer.  It was enough to put me off of it.

I rating below is for teabag bender for anyone lucky enough to find it. Spicy tea aroma, and spicy green tea flavor.  It leaves a green tea flavor on the palate, and it is not as nearly as heavily hopped as the standard bender. Some lemongrass.  The tea comes through quite well overall.  Another successul beer from Surly.  The palate however, it very light. Earlier Rating: 4/14/2006 Total Score: 3.7Maybe the best brown ale ever,  even though it doesnt fit into any style very well.  The aroma is mosty hops and light malt, but this is fairly light.  Flavor is coffee, medium sweet malt, and hops.  With the dark color it is like an oatmeal stout generously hopped.

2007,"2006-03-31",3.7,"suprised to see this spread out to the burbs and available at old chicago.  had 4 beers this evening and this was definitely my favorite.  nice balance of coffee malt and piney hops with a slight metalic finish.  nicely done, cannot wait for more.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","MoreHead"
2007,"2006-03-20",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 13, 2007 12/13/07: Can courtesy of Vikingbeau. Aroma is better than it appears from my previous rating. Creamy, chocolate hop aroma. Mostly opaque, murky reddish brown body with a thin tan head. Sheet lacing. Quite a bit of flavor for only 5.1% ABV. Id love to know what the caloric content is. A very enjoyable brew. Bender picks up 3 points from my earlier rating, all from aroma and appearance. Overall score dropped a point. 3/20/06: Not much aroma; a little faint chocolate malt. This is a dark brew (like coffee) with very little head. Very nice flavor; has some hops like a good American brown should. Chalky and chocolatety, perfect balance. Very nice finish; lovely.

2007,"2006-03-18",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 21, 2006 On tap at the Blue Nile.  Got to meet Pigfoot, who works there.  This is my first from this new brewer, and this one did not disappoint.  Bready flavor, with roasted nut and coffee overtones.  Head was light brown, mostly diminishing.  A clear body.  Hard to categorize the style, but nonetheless, it was enjoyable.  I cant wait to try the furious; Ive heard its pretty good from others.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
2007,"2006-03-08",4.5,"Had this beer at Champs in Maple Grove and Barley Johns in New Brighton.  The 2 glasses I had at Champs had a definite hoppy aftertaste whereas the one at Barley Johns lacked the hop flavor.  Beer was great at both locations.  Going to pickup a 5 gallon keg The Liquor Barrel in Golden Valley this weekend for at home. Todd rocks!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","WankerWeasel"
2007,"2006-02-24",3.9,"On tap at Bryant Lake Bowl.  Nice to see a new brewer in town welcome! As I tasted this beer I was plagued by the need to categorize. I say plagued because idealy one should approach each beer as if it were unique and appreciate its own nuance apart from the strictures of style. But Im human so I kept thinking ""too thin to be a porter"", ""not dry or nutty enough to be a brown"". When I finally settled on ""scotch ale"" I could relax and enjoy. This tastes very similar to Three Floyds Robert the Bruce. It is dark, malty and chocolaty like a scotch with a scotchs sessionability. The hops were unique and quite pleasant and reminded me very much of the Three Floyds interpretation. Well done and a nice addition to the regular taps.","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"
2007,"2006-02-04",4.2,"The Surly Brewing Company had intended from the start to create beers without definitions, that went beyond stylistic boundaries. With their initial releases, they have shown this ambition and realized it well. though we call this an American Brown Ale, its much more than that, and seems like a porter at times, which is how the brewer described it as, an Oatmeal Brown Porter. And why not?

Burnt sienna body, a crisp mahogony hue, with ruby crimson feet. Warm cocoa-toned head, like a cappocino topping, lasts long into the life of the pint.

Aroma is lightly nutty, slightly sweet, some caramel/toffee notes, then reveals itself dry and roasty. Earthy, open, inviting. I like it.

The brew boards the palate with confidence and lets loose an array of flavors. Malt is the main ingredient here, and some compelling ones were put into play, several caramels, some chocolate, (to make it more of a brown porter than a robust one) some Belgian Special B (yum, Im reminiscing on some favorite dubbels at times), and aromatic hops. Chocolate is here, nuts, and toffee, sweet for a second, then dry again, and toasty. The oats add an excellent amount of texture and grit to the mouthfeel that makes every sip something to savor. 

Body is medium to full, but its that texture that makes it memorable. Its smooth, but substantial, with a long, memorable finish, the flavors echo with every drop that rolls back over the tongue. 

Heres a brown ale you can drink, and which makes you think. Rather than pass the time in between gulps of a light, uncomplicated sweetish brown brew, it grabs your attention and your palate and makes you wonder a bit about it, and ponder on what makes you like it so much. Its an excellent introductory brew for this upstart, as people can reach for it again and again over a night at the bar,(""another Bender"", you say to the barman, and pretty soon youre on one!) and still ponder on its quality and taste, and come back for more the next night.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
2007,"2006-02-04",4.2,"On-tap at the Blue Nile: Murky mahogany color with a ruby glow at the bottom and edges. A mediumish sized capping of soft, light cocoa colored foam sits a top with good stamina. Fades to a thin collar and the lacing sits well across the glass in a broken sheeting.

Aroma is fairly solid of dryish black malt and chocolate malt husks. Tipping towards a sweet side with dark caramel malts and a milky powdered cocoa sense. Theres a nice little grassy hop note feathered into the husky tones thats quite nice.

Taste is rounded and immediate with a fairly full maltyness of caramel sliced with vanilla slivers, dustings of brown sugar, and breadish sweetness. Stays in place for good length adding oat barley flakes in there for some extra girth of sweetened breadyness before the sublime finish where it drys out with one fantastic realm of black malt-like grainyness and chocolate malt fluffyness. Slightly doughy but holds dry with a finely set tone of husk-like dryness. Very natural tasting and has a perky little hint to some grassy hops mixing in with the chocolatey dryness. A very nice taster. Nearly porter-like in stature.

Feel is fairly full and well-rounded; balance is slightly tilted in sweetness but then the finishing areas slide in with its intricately woven dryness pulling the sweetness off the tongue only leaving reminders of what once was. Whats left is a bready smooth porter-like soothingness with a small grainy, dryish, chalky, chocolatey milken texture. Unique and wholey acceptable in its sensibility.

Fully drinkable and sessionable. At around 5% this stuff can be had at the bar for a good long while and then some, and not get to terribly tiresome either due to its intriguing finishing qualities. A very nice American Brown/Porter-esk hybrid of a beer.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
2007,"2006-01-22",3.1,"On tap at Winterfest.Very cloudy brew with moderate carbonation.Lots of brown sugar and something like a fruity doughball that sat up uncovered in a barn for a week or two, like they were trying to cross this with a gueuze.Not bad for there first offering.","Western Minneapolis Suburbs, Minnesota, USA","footbalm"
2007,"2006-01-15",4.0,"Murky, deep brown.  Nose lightly peaty, some caramel, bit of smoke.  Hoppier than expected with some spicy and sweet earthy caramel.  Great aftertaste, maple syrup sweetness hangs on for a very long time.  Sampled from the brewerys inaugural keg served at the St. Paul Winterfest in 2006.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
