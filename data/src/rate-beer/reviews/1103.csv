Lots of pear and crisp tropical fruit. Light bodied and light textured. Fizzy carbonation and not much of a finish. Overall, not too bad. I wont be buying this one though.","Rockford, Illinois, USA","jmagnus87"
1103,"2011-10-06",3.4,"Bottle.  Pours a clear golden yellow.  Big sweet pear notes, a bit of pear candy, but not as artificial as most.  Reminds me of the pear flavored Jelly Belly beans. Medium bodied, more sweetness but a nice sharp tartness.  Long lingering pear.  Very nice.  Super easy drinking, not overly sweet.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
1103,"2011-09-07",3.5,"Bottle. Label says Fox Barrel Pacific Pear Cider, which is a true 100% pear perry with no apple juice base. Clear blond color with no head or lacing---but an excellent true pear aroma and taste. Medium sweetness. An excellent alternative to light (flavorless) beer!","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","milewide"
1103,"2011-08-16",2.5,"Pours a clear yellow color with no head or lacing. Aroma is pear juice. The taste is sweet pear, a bit too much sugar. Pretty tasty but theres nothing special about it.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","arondee"
1103,"2011-08-11",4.1,"Tap @ Flying Saucer KC. Light, clear yellow appearance with no head retention. Real, sweet pear, light vinous nose. Delicious, rich, sweet, part juice flavor with a bit dry finish. Best perry Ive ever had though Ive only had a couple.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
1103,"2011-08-07",2.9,"Bottle. Pale yellow almost transparent color. Lots of bubble... looks almost like ginger ale. Aroma is like apple juice, tastes sweet like cider or a wine cooler. Looks like champagne but definitely not a brut. Not my favorite type, but i guess oit  good and refreshiing for a hot day and easy drinking","New York, New York, USA","BrewBoxer"
1103,"2011-07-28",3.6,"Pear skin and pulp in the aroma with elements of apple cider.  The flavor is heavy on the pear skin and slightly sweet.  Actually pretty good.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
1103,"2011-07-17",2.5,"Appearance: clear light yellow pear hues with a tease of green. Pours with fizz which quickly disappears.

Nose: like biting into a super ripe pear juice so sweet youd wonder if it was artificially sweetened. Flambéed and roasted pears with powdered sugar sprinkled on top. Plump juicy sun-dried yellow raisins.

Palate: sweet and silken up front. Fresh pears in the middle. Pear skins tingle atop the tongue, lightly dry and bitter-sweet. Green along edges with more skin in the back swallow. Plump juicy yellow raisins in the middle.

Final Thoughts: ground-breaking no but better than expected yes. Sweet without being saccharine and the fact that it is a perry and not a cider is tastefully obvious. Id drink it again.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"
1103,"2011-07-09",2.4,"Pours a very pale color almost still. The aroma is potpourri and pear with some apple rind and spicy notes. This basically smells like a damned scented candle. The flavor is similarly spicy and sweet with plenty of sweet pear flavor and a good bit of booziness. As excited as I was to try a perry this was a mild buzz-kill.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
1103,"2011-06-21",3.8,"12 ounce bottle - $1.79 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours the same clear, faintly-hued yellow body with a thin, though lasting ring of finely-textured bubbles.

Smell: Notably pear-scented, whereas many of these other pear beverages leaving scratching your head as to where the pear is.

Taste: Sweetish, modestly tart taste of pear with a hint of large-sized marshmallow. Small pop of acidity. Sweetish, near-still finish.

Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Low carbonation.

Overall: A nice, pear-flavor-forward drink, if thats your thing.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

1103,"2011-06-19",3.1,"Pours a pale yellow, lots of carbonation. sweet fruity smell with an obvious pear taste and very thin body. Not overly sweet like some but still thin.

1103,"2011-06-03",3.4,"Bottle.  Aroma has some notes of pear, earth and leafy vegetables.  Pale yellow hue with no head or lace.  Palate is medium bodied and smooth but a little cloying on the finish.  Overall a little below average, I was expecting much more.","Saginaw, Michigan, USA","polomagnifico"
1103,"2011-05-18",3.6,"12oz bottle.  My first Perry.  Very pale, white-yellow.  No head, some carbonation bubbles on the bottom of the glass.  Some sweet candied pear aroma, but not that intense.  The taste is rather thin, sort of spritzer-like.  An interesting palate cleanser, very mild and inoffensive.  The pear comes out more as it approaches room temperature.  OK.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
1103,"2011-05-15",4.2,"This smells just like a sweet ripe Bartlett pear. Great. The flavor is also really quite good; light pear, light body and not too sweet. My new favorite perry. I would actually buy a six-pack of this in the future.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
1103,"2011-05-14",3.3,"The pour is a clear golden color with a short lived soda-like white head.  Smells of sweet and almost candied pears and lots of sugar.  A touch of yeast is also present.  The flavor is quite sweet as well.  Very sugary with a good pear flavor, but its sort of like canned pears in a heavy corn syrup.  Medium in body with a high carbonation.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

1103,"2011-03-13",2.0,"Bottle. Poured clear light pale color with a minimal sparkling white head that mostly diminished with virtually no lacing. Medium green pear fruit aroma. Light to medium body with a thin smooth dry texture and soft carbonation. Light to medium sweet pear flavor with a light to medium sweet finish of short to moderate duration. Worth having once.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
