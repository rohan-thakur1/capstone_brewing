 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  Poured a very hazy yellow-amber colored brew with a one finger just off white colored head. The head faded relatively fast to give a light level of lacing. 

 Smell  The aroma was rather light overall. It consisted of a toast and bready aroma mixed with a lighter fruit and some notes of a spiced aroma of nutmeg, clove and allspice. With these are some light honey sweetness and a good dose of yeasty smells.

 Taste  The taste starts out of a toasted bready and yeasty flavor with a lighter orange citrus taste. As the taste advances, more orange citrus and some apple flavors come to the tongue and mix with some light honey flavors. Soon some spiced flavors of nutmeg and coriander as well as a lighter banana and pepper flavor come to the tongue. These flavors bring the flavor profile to its end where they mix with a light herbal and floral note to leave a somewhat light yeasty and fruity spiced flavor on the tongue. 

 Mouthfeel The body of the beer was on the thicker side for the abv. with a carbonation level that was on the lower side. The body and lower carbonation made it more of a slower drinker then it normally would be, but were overall very nice for the yeasty and lightly spiced flavors of the brew. 

 Overall  A decent brew, although nothing really to exceptional for the price. It had a good level of complexity, but in some ways was a bit too complicated and confusing as some of the flavors really did not transition and meld together well. One to try, but not really one I would go to back to again and again.","","Darkmagus82"

2045,"2011-12-13",4.2,"750 ml bottle into tulip, no bottle dating.  Cork was stuck and broke off, so I had to use a wine key to remove it haha.  Pours slightly cloudy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers.  Small bits of lacing on the glass.  Aromas of big grape, apple, biscuit, caramel, candi sugar, citrus peel, grass, and spiciness.  Some nice and well balanced aromas; with good complexity.  Taste of caramel, toasted malt, biscuit, apple, citrus, candi sugar, pepper, and yeast spiciness.  Taste and aromas almost mirror each other.  Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, candi sugar, and spices on the finish for a bit.  Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel.  Very easy to drink.  Alcohol is extremely well hidden, nothing but a slight warming after the finish.  Overall an excellent biere de garde.  Great balance and complexity.  I definitely would like to try out more from this style.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
2045,"2011-05-18",2.5,"Pours a hazy reddish-orange with a head that flees in terror quickly after leaving the bottle.  Smells like wheat and hay with a little clove, fairly nice but confusing considering the lightness in flavor.  This beer hits all the proper notes of a Biere de Garde, but in a fleeting, watered-down fashion, with heavy carbonation that clears away any developing tastes before they can progress.  Too bubbly and way too expensive.  (3/10/09)","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"
2045,"2011-03-17",3.8,"A - Red amber color with a finger of tan head. Very nice retention on the head with some solid lacing left behind.

S - Aroma is full of fruity esters from apple/pear elements. There is also some sweet carmel malt aroma that blends and keeps the aroma from getting too sweet.

T - Starts off sweet and fruity wit ha bit of carmel malts present. Through the middle, some citrus/darker fruits come through with just a little bit of spice. The finish is a mix of the lighter fruits and the sweet malts which lingers nicely.

M - Medium bodied with light but fairly assertive carbonation. Very tingly on the tongue. The dry finish of the beer gives it a very crisp mouthfeel.

D - Very drinkable beer. Very smooth and crisp flavors with a nice balanced mouthfeel.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"

2045,"2010-05-23",3.8,"750mL bottle acquired quite a while back.

Pours a murky brownish amber with a big bubbly head that recedes to a thick collar and has streams of bubbles feeding it throughout.

The aroma is very sweet with pears and green apples coupled with some light grassy notes and flowers.  Also of note is the heavier malt sweetness than most beers of this style.

The taste is also sweet but I get more earthy character than the nose.  There are sweet caramel malts in the background with a much bigger hay and grass element with a slightly fry finish.  Not as dry as most biere de gardes, but not as massively sweet as I was expecting from the aroma.  That said, still plenty of green apples and sugar in there.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated, effervescent in fact.

This is a very sweet version of the style with lots of malts and fruit which forces the dry earthiness to the back.  Very complex and tasty.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
2045,"2010-05-03",4.0,"(Old BA rate - tap)
Beautiful ruby red color, with a quickly disappearing white head. Fairly muted aroma, with suggestions of fresh fruit and maltiness. The fruitiness of the brew was right up front with a good degree of malt sweetness. Pretty complex tastes, and hard for me to nail down everything to be honest. Medium to thin MF, and a little viscous. Hugely drinkable even with some complexities. Thoroughly enjoyable brew","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"
2045,"2010-04-22",3.8,"A- body is a semi-translucent ruby-amber that pours with a giant frothy, foamy off-white colored head. Head eventually settles to 1/2 finger and leaves behind traces of lacing all the way down. Yeast sediment can be seen floating in the glass.

S- Not much to the smell. Mild floral hops, a hint of funky yeast, and a hint of exotic fruit.

T-Mild flavor upfront with a minimal dry, exotic fruity flavor and a somewhat metallic background. A burst of floral hop flavor comes through for the finish as well as some bitterness. The slightest alcohol burn rises at the finish.

P-Medium weight body with low to medium tingly carbonation. Body is smooth and creamy.

O- Decent beer overall but not as awesome as I thought it would be. Its a nice chance to try another biere de garde though. 7% is barely detectable. Wouldnt mind having this again.

Aroma: Nose has some sugar, yeast, citrus, leaves, and spice

Overall Impression: 
This will serve as my first rating of a Biere de Garde.  Ive been meaning to knock this style off the list, so well do it here.  A pretty solid beer.

Sticky full-bodied palate that stings with a bit of carbonation, alcohol with warmth.

A nice caramel and malt aroma wafts from a dark orange and copper body with a decent white head. A carbonated body emits from a healthy yeast background with no hop flavors or bitterness to the brew. A sugar sweet flavor resembles homemade hard candy. While the mouthfeel could have been better, I must say this beer was impressive.","West Virginia, USA","WVHouseofBeer"

The taste is a full frenzy of mangos and cream, followed by those strawberries at the end (this is going to sound pretentious as hell, but more so the green top/hat of the strawberry than the actual fruit). The big thing really is how well this beer is put together; the hops after swallowing are both subtle and well-placed. Its almost like a little lime rind. So great effort, but $13?

This beer gave a nice pop when the cork flew out and it began to foam immediately but I was able to subdue the unruly bastard with a snifter. Nice orange-brown haze with an off-white foamy pillow. The smell was real nice, malt, honey, caramel. The taste, hmmm... Id say there is a slight caramel flavor, maybe some hops hiding out but this is very subtle, or my palate sucks). This is actually pretty enjoyable to drink. Im really not qualified to say whether this is a good example of the style but it is a good beer.

Later samples (which I enjoyed more) had less carbonation and a bit thicker, smoother texture. Light, patchy, broken lacing. Flavor features light pepperiness over caramel and some candy-malt sweetness. Even a bit of smokiness in warmer samples. Lightly bitter. As it warms it seems to become more of a big beer with a nice warming alcohol presence sneaking in near the finish. Light peppery aftertaste.

Still alot of caramel on the nose, though more freshly-baked bread and yeast.  Yeasty, spicy character, with a sweeping kick at the end, really earthy, pungent, and raw.

2045,"2008-03-20",3.4,"THOUGHTS: THis was my first Biére de Garde, so I didnt know what to expect. Not as much to it as I would have expected, but it does seem like it would be refreshing in the summer. Very pleasant, but very subtle. It was nice but not really my cup of beer. Ill have to try this style in the summer next time, after its been aged. Easy to drink though. (Jan 1. was a little soon to try this beer.) I hope to try an aged version of this one day and re-rate, because there seemed to be so much more in the beer than what was being revealed to me.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, medium, orangey amber with thin tendrils of carbonation that rose from the bottom and a huge, sudsy, off-white head that lasted a while then settled to a thin sheet. The aroma was light malt and moderate yeast. Very weak overall. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and lightly acidic; while the finish was moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic and moderately bitter. The flavor was sweet malt and yeast with a touch of spice. The light to medium body was sort of creamy then dry with fizzy carbonation and a lightly astringent finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"
2045,"2008-03-18",3.5,"bottle.  pours a quite clear reddish honey-amber with a thick cream head that fades faster than i expected for its size and density.  little chunks of lacing are left on the glass as it dissipates to a bubbly film.  on the first sniff, one gets notes of apple (not of the acetaldehyde variety) and pear, light caramel malts, and lots of spice.  the scent is almost cologne-like, in the sense that its quite pleasant, but gets a bit chemical when taken in too large of doses.  not only that, but it smells like cologne.  there are also some notes of raisins, and a pinch of spicy hops.  very light subtle taste, this time with white grape esters dominating the less-pronounced apple and pear notes, some spice, and again an ever-so-light caramel malt.  and there it is again, that light chemical note.  the alcohol is surprisingly noticeable for the 7.2% the label touts, but it doesnt necessarily detract.  very dry, very astringent finish, with a light sweetness and a tiny bit of tartness.  very effervescent mouthfeel--theres a ton of carbonation and it really adds to the dryness, but theres still that sharp chemical pull that feels like bitterness, but on the front of my tongue.  i think this beer would be pretty damned good if i could get around that strange chemical tongue-burn.  as it is, that note was off-putting, but it certainly didnt ruin the beer.  decent stuff that could only improve by being more drinkable.  maybe ill grab another bottle and cellar it for a year or two.","pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","hiddenvariable"

This beer pours with an immense rocky head that lasts throughout the beer.  Comprised of hundreds of thousands of small, dirty white bubbles, the head is very similar to Houblon in consistency.  
Sweet mead, deep honeyed color to the beer.
Taste is initially very belgian in the ester yeast profile and heavy caramel malt bill.
Well attenuated, with touches of funk coming out as the beer warms, and no small amount of fizziness and dryness.

Flaked biscuit and cookie dough flavors start out the palate, sweetened by a touch of caramel.  A hint of alcohol warmth comes through in the finish, along with some herbal hops and spicy herbs.

Halftime Beverage

Finally got my hands on a few of Southamptons offerings and this will be the first casuality. Cork releases with a loud pop. Pours a glowing golden-amber. A big loose frothy ivory head blew up on the pour and controlled 2/3 of the glass. Leaves sticky lacing as the head recedes.

Good aromas come forth right off the bat. Toasted and biscuity malts are the canvas of this ale. Fruity esters are mild but very well integrated. Hints of white grapes, pear skin, and even a little Granny Smith apple. Very inviting.

Flavor is right on par with the aromas. Theres quite a large malt profile in the form of toasted and biscuity malts just like the smell. Just enough fruity esters round out the flavor perfectly. Again, the pear sking, mild tart green apples, and a touch of the white grapes. Great well rounded flavors coming from this beer.

Medium body that turns exceptionally creamy and frothy as it hits the tongue. Good carbonation massages the tongue.

A beer I can drink all night long without a problem. Refreshing balanced and unique.

This is my second Southampton beer and my first from the 750 series. I cant hardly wait to try the others I picked up. A very solid enjoyable Biere de Garde.

2045,"2007-08-04",4.3,"Pours a very bright copper with a thick, frothy three finger head that settles very slowly to a nice solid cap. The lacing is thick, leaving behind large patches of foam.

Smell; tons of sweet malts dominate up front with caramel and some brown sugar, but theres also an underlying dusty yeastiness. Theres also just a hint of some hops in the background as well.

Taste; the malts are just as evident in the flavor as in the nose, and the combination of the brown sugar, caramel, a nice toasted presence and the spiciness from the yeasts give this a flavor reminiscent of gingerbread. The hops actually make a bit of an appearance, but are driven back again by the malts.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit slick, with the beer leaving a bit of a coating on my tongue. This actually helps to give this a bit of a long finish. Drinkability is really damn good. Give me a few more bottles of this and youll make my day.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

In long:  As expected with the style the beer is rather sweet with a lot of honey taste.  However this one is crisper than usual for the style with roasted hay and quite a bit of crisp caramel.  Earthy.  The carbonation is very lively, borderline aggressive.  Creamy fluffy body.  Tasty beer.

2045,"2007-03-16",3.9,"From a caged corked 750 ml. bottle with no bottling, freshness date I could find, a short blurb on the back label, sampled at cellar temperature in a chalice. 

Poured a chill hazy deep reddish copper with a tight, foamy white head, good retention, small amount of laced sticking.

Aromas of sweet toasted grainy malts, subtle earthy, musty yeast, fruity esters, spicy, floral, citrusy hops and light whiffs of alcohol.

Good carbonation and a crisp, dryish, velvety smooth light bodied mouthfeel.

Delicious tasting, sweet toasted malts, grainy bread, slightly tart citric fruitiness, earthy spices, a cellar mustiness, the alcohol is noticeable towards the end, meshes with the malts and provides a soft, slow warmth in the palate, and a dry, sweet toasted grain, citric, mildly spicy finish.

2045,"2006-12-12",5.0,"Sampled a pint of the 2006 version of this beer on draught at the Publik House in Southampton, NY on 12/4/06. As far as biere de garde goes, I dont see how you could get any better than this beer. It was flawless, and one of the most delicious beers I have tasted in quite some time. This beer pours to a beautiful, bright, deep copper color, with a creamy white head, and a good carbonation. The nose on this beer is wonderful, with lots of good aromas of pale malt, light toast, light nuts, fresh baked bread, caramel, and some hints of peppery alcohol. The mouthfeel on this beer is slightly slick and buttery, as waves of fantastic malt flavor coat the tongue. As in the nose, delicious flavors of fresh baked bread, light toast, nuts, and caramel. There is a hints of plummy fruit, but a rich, delicious, clean, malt flavor is the star of this show. This beer finishes with more fantastic malty flavors up front, then ends with some good, peppery alcohol that warms and lingers. On draught at the brewpub, this beer is phenomenal. Worth the trip to Southampton, and I was happy to take a growler to go of this one.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

2045,"2006-08-01",4.2,"2005 cork and wire.  Poured into a Westmalle goblet.  Color is deep murky amber with a small head that quickly turns into lacing.  This beer has a strong sweet characteristic to it.  Others have called it burnt sugar, caramel and butterscotch but I am going to call it cookie or cookiedough.  Obviously, this represents a strong malt character, which I believe is the strongest part of the beer.  In the aroma it is accompanied by spices and floral aspects.  Mouthfeel is the only aspect I am not fully enjoying - too fizzy, spikey on the mouth.  The taste is spikey tropical fruits with that great cookiedough malt kick in the end.  Leaves a sweet aftertaste.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
2045,"2006-07-28",4.0,"2005 bottle from NYC. Tough cork yields a punchy pop with lots of head on the opaque russet body. Fruity esters spill out as soon as the bottle breathes. The fruit smells are much like that of fruit punch and tropical fruits, as well as lemon and guava. Also present in the aroma is a strong licorice and caramel. Sweet upon entering the mouth, with the same fruit punch character, then showing lots of caramel/licorice, sugar, and melted milk chocolate. Orange and spice is prevalent too. A very solid beer, and one that would be much better suited for the winter months.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

2045,"2005-04-14",4.6,"750 mL bottle (corked & caged, 2004  sampled April 2005): loud cork removal and a beautiful pour: brilliant & fiery red-orange body with a tall, rocky and creamy light tan head, which persists without fail.

Fruity, yeast esters fill a robust aroma with luscious red apples, soft over ripe pears, sweet sourdough, dusty alcohol, and golden raisins.  Elegant, velvety palate with orange zest and coriander spices most evident.  Sweet marmalade covered biscuit flavours are more pronounced by the bitter hoppiness and well developed spice and yeast.  Certainly a winner, possibly enhanced by the year+ in the cellarAddition of the dregs adds an iron and blood component to the aroma, adding even more complexity and a perhaps a more traditional barnyard essence?  Flavours stay fairly consistent, with perhaps a bit more bitterness and touch of metallic character.

This wasn*t as I expected and my assumption is that the 2005 batch is different from the others. Nice big frothy white, long lasting head. Wonderful brown amber color. Bubble gum, sweet candy nose. Malt taste in the beginning, koriander too but badly followed by a huge butterscotch aroma, toffee.  As it warmed up, it released a toasted malt aftertaste and also an intense alcohol nose.

2045,"2004-07-26",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 28, 2004 2004 Bottle Date, Sampled July 2004
Pours a hazy amber color.  It has a well endowed thick tan head that is kept afloat by a pretty good amount of carbonation.  There is an enticing aroma that is a mix of fruit and subtle spices.  I get aromatic notes of pear, apple, fig,  and a bit of bready yeastiness, though the fruitiness certainly dominates the aroma.  This is definitely a very enjoyable nose.

The taste is much different than the nose, or at least I was lead to believe the beer would taste quite a bit different than it does.  The taste is quite malty with a finish that reminds me of biscuits and lightly toasted whole-grain bread.  There is almost a chalky quality to the palate of this one, it seems to boost the body and make this beer seem a bit fuller.  This is certainly interesting, I was expecting much more yeast character; more fruitiness, and more spiciness.  This is one of those Biere de Gardes that goes for the cleaner flavor profile and relies more upon the malt character.  The malts in this beer really shine, without the amped up malts this would be a flabby beer because of the restrained yeast character.  As this beer warms up I get some  nice fruitiness up front, with notes of pear and apple.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2045,"2003-11-18",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2007 2002 bottle.  Has a pale gold color, with some hazy orange tinges, had a huge foamy white head, plenty of lacing.  Aroma of mild hay, some sharper leather/sweet fruit notes.  An older, stronger peach/alcohol aroma is apparent as well.  Begins with a good amount of malt, quite wet on the palate but flavor dries out towards finish with some mild astringency.  Very dry biscuity nuances, and a whole lot of carbonation add a peppery element, that, when mixed with the drier, moderately bitter hops, reminds me slightly of a rusty, earthy flavor.  Body is a solid medium, a little bit of thinning as it warms.2004 bottle  My second sampling of 2 different vintages of a Southampton bottle (the other being the Grand Cru).  And it makes for a good experience.  Appearance is a five for me off the bat.  Tons of white foamy head and lacing, rich copper-amber color.  In fact, thats what I recall the 2002 being like, not sure why I only gave it a 4 then.  Aroma is full of dough, biscuits and more yeast than I recall.  Hops are apparent in the nose and the flavor, giving a good balance but an odd feel for a biere de garde, overall.  Peppermint, green hops, sweet cherries and wheat bread.  Gets dry and biscuity with a strange musty yeast, on the end.  Medium to medium-full body, no alcohol apparency. Ill up the appearance a point, Im satisfied with the rest.2005 bottle  Fortunately, I didnt find this to have had an off-year, as so many from this brewery had in 2005.  Same great appearance, spectacular lacing, retention, etc...Muted fruits in the nose, with light caramel, dry yeast and almond/vanilla notes.  That trademark cellar flavor that I find this one employs so well to authenticate this style.  Apples, cherry blossoms, vanilla, and a very strong balance, with engaging carbonation.  Definitely a bit too sweet yet, however, and Im sure in a couple years, the yeast will have had time to really elaborate on things in the flavor.  Dry, almond paste and honey-covered red apples in the finish, with a light acidity.  Some alcohol apparent.2006 bottle  Now contracted out of Sly Fox, but to me, it seems every bit as good.  Great appearance, Sly Fox knows how to bottle.  Sweet honey, nuts and lightly tart yeast in the nose, very sticky, with lots of fluffiness from the yeast and a bit of alcohol perfuminess.  Sweet, very malty flavor seems a little bit more pale (not as heavily caramel and bready as I recall) but every bit as rich and chewy.  The bottle was very fresh and still needs time to condition.  Another great vintage, this beer seems immune from the downward slide SHPH has been on lately.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Slightly hazy orange/copper colour with a great dense off-white aroma. Sweet spicey aroma. Thin-bodied; a bit sour to start, but finishes full and flavourful. A bit reminiscent of a flemish sour, but more flavourful. Overall, a good beer and worth trying...pretty much spot on to my first bottle.

Bottle #1:
Amber in colour, a generous off-white head and trillions of small bubbles rise from the bottom. Very strong yeastiness  with clean aromas (coriander) and a bright sweet scent. Medium-bodied; Very carbonated, strong grassy hops in the taste as  well as earthy, mushroomy and musty flavours last a long time. Aftertaste plentiful with yeast, wheat and a showing of a  bit of hops and more crazy flavours: grass, metal and freshness. Alcohol is pretty noticeable, so is the carbonation, but  both are very nice! Not anything wrong with this beer, definately a lot going on with it, which makes it even nicer to try  it! Since this is my first Biere De Garde styled beer it's tough to say that is above average, but regardless it is pretty  good and worth trying to find.

2045,"2003-07-01",4.5,"Multiple orange hues descend into the depths of the wine glass I'm using. Quite translucent around the edges. Lots of tiny foam bubbles cling to life before expiry. Aroma is fresh baked bread and yeast, a touch of white wine and some unidentifiable, unexpected sweetness - sugar? Chablis flavors, along with a melding of subtle bitterness and sugar. Effervescent on the palate but still of some real gravity. Is it just suggestion or is the alcohol hitting fast and furious? Winey like 3 Monts but better! On the other hand, has the haylike farmhouse complexity of La Bavasienne but sweeter - fabulous - a big thanks to TAR for this gem!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
2045,"2003-06-30",3.5,"My bottle is called ""Southampton Biere de Garde.""  Cloudy orange with teeny black yeast flecks suspended in the glass.  I'm guessing, from the taste, that this brew has about 10% alcohol, because it's hard to miss.  Tastes rather Belgian and yeasty.  Bitter finish - quite bitter!  I don't see the Barleywine analogy as some do.  This is very much like a Belgian Strong in style.  A beer to be respected (and perhaps feared).","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
2045,"2003-06-24",4.1,"Bottle.  Fruity aroma: Banana-pear, slight esters.  Light amber, average head.  A little phenolic.  Very clean taste & mouthfeel; peaches/nectarines apparent.  Nice!","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"
2045,"2003-06-16",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2003 Gentle aroma, effervescent with a bit of bubblegum.  Dark yellow color, loose white head.  Aggressive palate, tingling and spicy at the same time.  Bitter finish after a bowl of fruit in the mouth. Original rating: 7-4-7-4-15 (3.7) // Re-rate (August 16th): hazy orange, thin ring of head.  Yeasty, floral, apple-bake aroma.  Very attractive.  A hint of sourness and gueuze.  Some doubts emerge at the end but still a good palate and good beer.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
2045,"2003-06-15",3.7,"Cloudy orange with yellow edges with a coarse, soapsud-like head.  Taste was of sour apples, finsih was bitter with notes of bubblegum....I believe this is my first experience with the style....not bad.","Katy, Texas, USA","Andrew196"
2045,"2003-06-15",4.6,"Wonderful! Heathery, slight wet bandage, fruity esters in the apple pear range, clean finish, big aroma, cleansing palate, joyous!! My vote for Best in Show at Austin Tasting I","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
2045,"2003-06-15",4.0,"Buttery, round, full, acidic, sweet, delightfully complex. Confirms all the good repotrs I have heard about Southampton and my respect for those on this site that know their beers. I need to drag myself back up there so I can get more and really get lost ina a bottle (and check out their other fares).","austin, Tejas, Texas, USA","fly"
2045,"2003-03-19",4.5,"750corked bottle: Hazy, penny-colored beer,with pillows of tightly,beaded bubbles. Excellent aroma of caramel,bread,wood,perfumey hops,and a little alcohol.Little barnyard as well. Mouthfeel is somewhat spritzy,but it coats the mouth and lingers.Flavors of caramel,grape,wood,light spice and some subtle sourness.Finish warms the insides leaving bready,earthy-hop flavors.The flavors and alcohol please.As the beer rests and loses carbonation the flavor and palate improve nicely,making finishing this big bottle a very fun time.THe finish turns to fine toffee and lingers forever. By the end of the bottle the barnyard flavors fool you into thinking you are drinking a true French biere de garde. A perfect big bottle to drink by yourself,the longer it sits,the better it gets. Nice looking bottle as well.","Evansville, Indiana, USA","raindog"
2045,"2003-02-13",4.4,"A warm and fuzzy mouthfeel, filling my mouth with the goodness this beer brings.  Very sweet and malty, with definite caramel present.  Heavy yet smooth.  This is good stuff. Frothy white head on a dark amber body.  I wonder what the alcohol content is?","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
2045,"2003-02-13",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 24, 2006 This came in a 750ml bottle (thank you shoreline beverage) with the most hard to remove cork ever.  I pulled and tugged until my arm ached, and then the top of the cork broke off, then I could use a corkscrew.  Now, to the beer.  This is a quite unique biere de garde.  Its like a barley wine wedded with a belgian strong.  The appearance is a deep, golden brown, and the aroma is of caramel, toffee and some fruit.  Good head, nice lacing.  The flavor is exploding with caramel, fruits, pretentious European candies, sweet maltiness, and perhaps some sweetbreads.  The finish is smooth and sweet; the beer leaves a sticky feeling on the lips.  This is great stuff.  I need to go back and buy some more bottles for cellaring.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
2045,"2002-11-02",4.1,"Cloudy amber/orange color. Thin but persistent, creamy head and lace. Nose of mouthwatering sweet malt, flowers, light spices and subtle waves of alcohol. Almost medium bodied, playful carbonation but creamy and almost soft. Subtle/fluffy malt on palate, soft floral notes, a slightly musty, sligtly sour yeast character in the middle leading to a slightly bitter, innocently sour and lasting finish. Has a nice kick to it with wine wine notes to boot. Reminds me of a cross btw Bière des Sans Culottes and 3 Monts  but more assertive. Malt could be a little more defined but thats just me. Won a gold medal at 2002 Real Ale Fstival Chicago. If your a fan of the style, hunt it.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
2045,"2002-03-04",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2003 Creamy head, caramel malt aroma, firm and sweet malt foundation (similar to De Koninck?)  Nice alcohol punch and subtle bitterness.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
