2851,"2016-02-07",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2016

Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, corn syrup, yeast, fruit, grain, hops and citrus.

Appearance:

Turbid yellow/golden amber beer with a slight/medium white/off-white head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel, corn syrup, yeast and fruit; ends slightly bitter and dry with grain, hops and citrus.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Amazing balance with all the flavours you would expect in a quality Pilsener. Could have benefited from some fruitier hops, but that is about it. The great appearance and palate are definitely the highlight.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Also a lot more subtle in its style compared to a lot of new beer, which can actually be refreshing after a while. Bier/blonde is just excellent when its totally fresh.

2851,"2012-11-28",3.8,"33cl swing-top bottle, 2.75. Look: Hazy yellow colour, unfiltered, nice creamy white head. Hoppy nose, hmmm! Aroma is prominently hops, with bitter orange peel. Is this a pilsener? More similar to a soft IPA to me... It has an american hop feel in the beginning, then the saaz remain on the tongue. Malts seems a bit subdued, less bready than others, still being smooth. However, aroma focus on the grassy notes, possibly a remain of yeast. Alcohol hardly noticeable. Taste, again, hops does a major role. Minimal initial sweetness and an exciting bitter bite, good and not excessive. Finish is quite long and hoppy, bitter, soft. Body is medium, low carbonation. Overall an unexpected nice surprise, very good when a hoppy one is desired. Price over the average, but hard to find and absolutely worth. Somewhat similar to Urthel Saisonnière.","ITALY","JaKeAFC"

2851,"2012-11-19",3.3,"33ck Flip-top bottle taken at Cafe de Grendelpoort, Valkenburg during a stay over in Oct 2012.

The beer pours a cloudy/hazy orange colour: on top a white covering of thick foam, which stayed for the whole tasting.

The nose was yeasty and hoppy with a strong fruitiness to the fore, a semi-sour citrusy smell became more apparant as the beer warmed in the glass.

Taste wise it was a pleasant blend of hops and malts, each around the same in their strength of flavour. So, well balanced and neither sweet or dry. Refreshing and easy to drink with enough hop bite to excite and plenty of malty sweetness to counteract those bittering hops.

The alcohol sits nicely within the brew and is just about noticed in the mouth feel, wouldnt want it any stronger.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

""Christoffel Bier"" steht auf dem Etikett; nix mit Pils...Der Vermerk ""dubbel gehopt"" weist zwar in diese Richtung, aber im Glas habe ich beileibe kein Pilsener. Sieht vielmehr recht dunkel aus in Richtung orange und dazu noch ziemlich trüb. Im Aroma eher süßlich-sauer, merkwürdig. Im Antrunk auch eher malzig und die 6,0% Alk. schlagen unangenehm durch. Im Abgang kommt dann eine ziemlich strenge Herbheit, die das bisherige Geschmackserlebnis ziemlich auf den Kopf stellt. Für mich viel zu unausgewogen und auch nicht wirklich bekömmlich; der Schädelfaktor ist ausgesprochen hoch. Zum Glück hab ich kein Verlangen nach einem weiteren Glas Christoffel, Schutzpatron der Flodders ;)

2851,"2011-09-10",3.7,"11.2 fl oz bottle. A very unique beer here in the lager style. To me, its really defined by its butterscotch cookie and grainy herbal bitter qualities.

Cashews, butterscotch, fruity esters, brown sugars malts, and herbal funk make the aroma hard to gloss over. Really a one of a kind nose. The body is well carbonated, though creamy at the same time, like a lighter rootbeer float. Body is very malty upfront, becoming very bitter toward the end. I enjoyed this phase change quite a bit.

It opens with a loud pop. It pours a murky golden brown with a sudsy white head. The head leaves a lot of intricate lacing.

The smell is very nice. It is deep and honey-like with a noticeable noble hop kick with some lemon, lime and grapefruit rind. There is also a noticeable grassiness. 

The flavor is deep and rich. It has nuttiness, fruitiness, some nice citrus and grassiness form the hops, and some nice malty graham cracker/bread flavors. This is a nice fuckin lager, who says they cant have depth. I love the hoppiness here as well.

I havent had many Kellerbiers and it seems I always dont get them at optimal freshness, this one was a new one at the store and sold in the cooler, and it was great.

Flavor is mild but unpleasant Im highly disappointed in this beer I must of picked an old bottle that was stored in the sun on top of heater.

The head is medium-sized with clumpy pockets of bubbles.  The aroma is both sweet, like overripe fruit and tart with acids.  It has a Belgian smell that also reminds me of high alcohol barley wines.  Wow!  What a surprise.  This beer is as dry as it gets.  It rolls off of your tongue and down your throat like water on concrete mix.  Its hard to pinpoint the various tastes but lemon, pepper and hops shine through.  This beer is quite light considering the 6% ABV.  Im not happy with the Pilsener classification it carries though.  It strikes me more like a generic Belgian ale.  It think this beer would go well with Chinese chicken dishes like sweet & sour chicken or lemon chicken.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MrRain"

How: Bottle 330ml flip-top.  Consumed fresh as soon as I received through private importation
The look: Cloudy dark blonde body topped by a large white head with good retention
In long: Nose is noble grassy hops and meringue.  Tasty cereals, light honeyed sweetness quickly taken over by the dry and slightly spicy grassy hops.  Dry wood notes.  Bready yeast or bready malts, I dont know but bready something. Body is smooth and chewy and the carbonation is very lively.  Ive pub-crawled in Czech Republic and I find the Christoffel to be the most authentic Czech draft Bohemian Pilenser that Ive had in the comfort of my home.

2851,"2008-08-12",3.2,"04-Feb-08 (330-ml swing-top bottle: Purchased 18-Nov-07 for $3.79 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA)  The beer pours golden-amber in color and very cloudy from visible chunks of suspended particles.  Not what I would expect from a ""blond"" lager.  The off-white head, however, is tall and creamy, very gradually settling to a thin layer and wide ring with large patches of dense lace left on the glass.  Smelling the beer, the hops aroma dominates and is redolent of dry hay and musty magazines stored up in the attic, but the nose also offers a bit of sweet honey-like maltiness in the background.  The flavor is more traditional lager: clean, grainy malts with minimal sweetness, but this is balanced wonderfully by bright, grassy, moderately bitter hops.  A slight toastiness emerges in the finish as the beer warms a bit.  Dry, dusty and slightly chalky mouthfeel, clean bitterness and moderate carbonation complement the medium body of the malty base for a beer that is refreshing, easy and fun to drink.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

2851,"2008-01-02",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2009 Bottled 33cl. It pours a hazy, light orange beer with a rocky, rich whitish head. The nose of pine needles, grapefruit, elderflower, oranges and peaches. Wonderfully hoppy, grassy, sappy with a transcendent delicate floral touch. Some lemon and yeast in the aroma too. The taste is extremely bitter with pine needles and grapefruit accompanied by oranges, lemon and elderflowers. Sappy, floral and wonderfully hoppy. Some marmelade combines with a crisp toastiness. Honey sneaking in after a few sips. This beer a perfect, beautiful lacing. A beer with a remarkable appearance. I m clearly giving 5 points here. The finish is very powerful,  dry and bitter with hints of grapefruit, heather and lemon showing up. I wonder how high the IBU of this beer is.... Anyway, a great brew.

Pleasant hop perfume, along with some doughy characters.  Medium light bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel with a plush palate.

2851,"2007-07-23",3.8,"Pours with almost a four finger thick, light tan colored head that is fairly large bubbled; as the head falls it leaves some thick, clumping, lacing patterns on the sides of the glass.  The beer is a lightly hazy, orangish-gold color.  Hoppy aromatic notes of hay, a light herbal notes and a touch of lemon grass mix with malty notes of crushed grain & soda crackers.

Much fuller body than I was expecting, but it is still light; this is most certainly an all malt beer.  Sweet malt notes are noticeable, though not anywhere near dominant.  Quite a grassy flavor profile towards the finish.  An ample hop character is found throughout this; Hints of lemon grass, a big, sharp, herbal hop character and a solid bitterness that shows up from beginning to lingering end.  The flavor is actually so much better than the aroma, which had me waiting to be disappointed by the flavors.  This has a really good balance between malt and hop, despite being a definitely hop accented beer (even for a Pilsner).  The malt provides two main components, a biscuit-like and cracker-like note and a soft malt sweetness.  The former accents the grassy hop notes, while the latter provides a structure for all of the other flavors to rest on.  The bitterness almost has a vibrant, green hop character to it; it is a touch astringent, certainly bracing, yet always somehow balanced just enough by sweet malt notes.

Definitely a fantastic Pilsner; I was under whelmed by the aroma, but luckily the flavor had everything I was looking for.  I do believe there is a hint of diacetyl character here, which contributes positively by accenting the malt character of this beer","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Long lasting medium beige head slowly collapses to a craggy mountain of foam before finally settling down. The most astounding suspended yeast Ive ever seen in a beer (similar to Two Hearted Ale but better). A couple years and several bottles later, and Ive yet to find anything to compete with this in the pilsner category. I find it hard to imagine a better pilsner available in North America. Incredible herbaceous hop character, long aftertaste. Water, barley malt, hops, yeast, you can taste it all in high definition. Full-bodied for the style. This one always reminds me why I love beer in the first place.

Taste was light and smooth:  bit of spice, but mostly grass and citrus hop and a slight honey-like sweetness from the malts.  The finish here is different and hard to describe - failing any specifics, there is a  pronounced malt sweetness. Slightly bitter after that was the only downside to this brew.  High carbonation, quite effervescent on the tongue. Very good.","Ithaca, New York, USA","dmradus"

2851,"2007-04-29",2.8,"Pours cloudy golden with lots of unexpected yeast sediment mucking up the appearance - medium white frothy head. Stale apple, hay and grassiness in the nose. I found the flavor to be cluttered and messy with notes of wood, stale malt/apple, caramel, hay/grain then some grassy/lemony noble hop character in the finish. Full and round with a nice, creamy texture and carbonation. While it doesnt necessarily taste ""bad"", it didnt quite do it for me (for a pilsner).","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"

2851,"2007-03-27",3.7,"33cl bottle purchased from Belmont Station.  Poured slowly to avoid the pile of sediment in the bottom, but I over-did it and ended up with a swirl of yeast in the glass.  Aroma of spicy noble hops, a touch of yeast, and a solid under-pinning of Munich/Vienna malt flavors.  Pours a beautifully soft honey color with a rapidly receding white head that diminishes and then rebuilds itself after each tip of the glass.  The flavor starts as a sweet malt sensation on the tip of the tongue, washes across the palate in waves of spicy hops and bread crumbs, and finishes by leaving a trail of earthy, spicy flavors in the throat.  Quite tasty, if it were a bit cheaper Id buy a ton of it, but at $3.50 per bottle it will be an occasional treat.","Oregon, USA","NICU"

Flavor is mostly the honey and hay maltiness but is more muted than aroma. Some piney hop bitterness sneaks in toward finish.

The parching flavor of wheat and dry hops is initially aggressive upon the tongue and surprising in its noble bitterness, but eventually reveals a multitude of unique tonalities.

Sweet cream pale malt sugars muddled with white figs and almonds. A light edge of dusty grains and a nip of bread and yeast. Sinfully drinkable. I wish Id bought more than one. It has a real clean lemon and grass hop bite on the back end that draws out the malt sugars into a crisp finish.

2851,"2006-10-10",2.5,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2006 To be brutally honest, this beer puts forth most of the qualities I dislike in a beer.  It was excessively bitter, with a terrible soapy aftertaste.  It did pour a beautiful orangey color, and had a rather nice head, but the positives end there.  The carbonation is typical of a pilsner style beer, and the head fades pretty slowly, leaving a nice lacing.  Theres a strong grass / plant sort of smell, and then the bitter soap taste kicks in and its game over.  Every sip fades into a quick reminder that you shouldnt take another.

Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

2851,"2006-06-07",3.9,"Nifty little swing top bottle. Might be my favorite pilsner, although it wasnt traditional in any sense. The pour resulted in a dark amber, practically brown colored beer with some sedimentation and a small head that yielded decent lacing. The aroma was somewhat sour, malty, and with some grassy and light floral hops. The flavor was very rich for the style, caramel malts, lemon juice, vienna type spicing, and some honey. Very complex for a mere ""pilsner."" Mouthfeel was moderate but not very carbonated.","","User37895"
2851,"2006-05-30",3.3,"Comparing to something i know, i would compare this one to tuborg guld (usually called guldtuborg). TG has a 5.6% alc. and this one has 6%, but carries those 6% with great style. The higher alc. (than 4.5 or so which i am most used to) is used to make a great taste, not to just make it stronger. Or so it seems. I get the feeling of a strong, mature, ""i know what im about"" beer, and it tastes like more. The bottle is nice too.

We are not into something extarordinary, but TG is a favorite of mine, and this one is just as good, or better. Probably better.

Taste is like a good gold beer. None of the bad things have happened to this beer, it is like a gold beer ought to be. It would be a great thing to get drunk with, on a carpet in the woods, a hot summer day, in good company.

It has these extra nuances to the taste that are really great. You can explore this one. It has more to it than the first impression. Great beer of its kind. Not the kind of beer i really like, but one of the best ive had in that category. (ive probably tasted 30-35 different kinds in that category)","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Pinball"

2851,"2004-03-10",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 14, 2005 March 04:  33 cl bottle, from the gorgeous gift pack with Robertus (why cant I get this in VT).  Cloudy light golden, big soft fragile head, beautiful snowflake lacing in the glass.  Very fresh, malty-grassy nose, nothing different really -- just archetypally good.  Great flavor balance, with grassy fresh goodness, some light bready maltiness, and a powerful but not overbearing cedary hoppiness to finish; hints of black or raspberry I think as well.  This is a very subtle refresher and probably wont blow away the hopmeisters out there; Im glad I have a 2nd one to try, as I wouldnt be surprised to find that Im underrating it.

2851,"2004-01-17",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2006 Was really looking forward to trying this beer - it was good but not quite as good as I was expecting. Hazy orange colour, good head retention. Looks like it has heaps of flavour. Quite hoppy aroma - started out thinking it was just Hallertau but by the end I thought I smelled something vaguely American. Spicy, perfumy at the start then quite piney as it warmed.
Fresh, juicy malt flavour, heaps of spicy hop flavour and a mild bitterness but very long finish. Fullish body and low carbonation which is good. Quite good but not great. RR: I hope this was a bad bottle and not a change in the brewing process. My Dutch expert housemate said it was still better than VB, but I disagreed. Just tasted like a crap lager, completely lacking hops. Im going to give it the benefit of the doubt, even though Im pissed off that the only bottle Im likely to see for quite a long time was no good.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

Fascinatingly balanced earthy hop interplay paired with a lovely cane sugar sweetness.  Round hops emerge after a coarse touch of earthy, piney hops.

Floral hops grow wild amongst the bulging grapefruit and pink peppercorns. Bready yeast and multifarious citrusy spices levitate from the muted yet sagacious grounds. Becomes absolutely hypnotizing when reaching near-room temperature.

The Festivities:A hoppy epiphany persuades the tongue and palate that it is the berth of all sensory experience. Dry, resinous, piney, wooden hops are seen growing out of the haystack to become future hop sequoias. Spicy, herbal, perfumy hops stick out of a hidden beehive where a smacking yet monastic honey source rests serenely, waiting to be discovered. Eating pears through this most vibrant garden of Eden, and moderately sprinkling yeast on the perfect number of hop buds. Some bottles though are overly yeasty and sweet, and those arent the Christoffel Blond I love.

2851,"2002-03-01",3.7,"Sweet hoppy aroma. Very sharp dry taste, with more mellow malty overtones. Long-lasting aftertaste which finishes off bitter. A very interesting beer.","Greater London, ENGLAND","Dragonblaze99"
2851,"2002-01-26",3.6,"Fruity and perfume aroma. Yellow (not golden) colour. Cloudy, nice head. Sweet, bit soapy, full, some fruits. Dry finish, hop bitter. The hop taste lasts very long.","Delft, NETHERLANDS","jbrus"

2851,"2001-11-18",4.9,"UPDATED: NOV 17, 2003 Christoffel Blond is a hopheads delight.  It's just dripping with herbal, piney hop goodness and just enough bready malt flavours to carry the hops through to the lingering bitter finish.  From the cloudy, shimmering appearance to the elegant middle to the assertively bitter finale, this is an exercise in style.  It's a shame that it is appreciated by so few.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
2851,"2001-11-15",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2012 Golden coloured, firm head, some haze. Very hoppy nose, some fruity notes shine through. Strong hoppy flavour initially, later on some maltyness shines through, but its the bitterness that lasts. Making a good pilsener is an art, and the Christoffel guys completely master te style.","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"
