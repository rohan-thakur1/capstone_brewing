4513,"2016-07-09",4.0,"Numerous pours over the past five years: Toasted golden. Fine, persistent white head. Polished malt aromatics of cookie and pecan harmonize with vividly expressed tealike, grassy and lemon candy hops. Notably soft mouthfeel. Graceful carbonation. Lush grassy malt immediately envelops the mouth, gradually progressing into crisper notes of candied pecan which testify to the beautifully decocted malt. Hoppy succulence pervades with appetizing grass and spice characteristics. Sappy oils ooze from the sparkling yet rustic hoppiness, soothing the palate as sassier wood-root spices and tealike notes sizzle fervidly. A metallic twinge of grassy hops aligns with toasted piecrust maltiness in the cohesive finish. Another gem from Kout that exhibits all the old world charm Ive come to expect from them.

4513,"2016-04-27",4.6,"Draught at Kings Head Pub on 4/2/16.Dont for sure know this isnt the kvasnicovne version, and in the States these are always just listed as Koutska followed by the number, so there was no way to tell anyways, but the beer had no haze (not that that means anything necessarily) and I assume the kvasnicovne version stays closer to the origin (though technically the yeast would help preserve the beer longer). Anyways, putting my rating here.A light amber-golden body is topped by a medium-sized, well-retained head. Interesting, would have thought this to be pale golden. Clarity is high.In the nose, it reminds me of Andechs. Not that theres a similarity in aroma, but rather, it has that same, elegant, charming yeast character that shows complex minerality and vague, dainty fruit notes. Behind that, there is light caramel and red berry-like character from the specialty malts and rich honey-drenched bread from the pils malt. Hops are nicely balanced; this isnt a grass/floral/spice bomb, yet the moderate spiciness does help balance the malt, gently. No alcohol or flaw in the nose.Similar profile to the flavor, being more malt forward, with definite sweetness and yet a drying, lightly biscuity/bready finish replete with light fruitiness, hints of caramel and plentiful spicy hops. Carbonation is gentle, but mostly tight, with a soft, malty texture. At first I thought it might be a bit too malty, and for sure its malt-forward, but the complex flavors that are created by yeast and specialty malt are just too endearing to not fall in love with. I happily ended up ordering a second pint. Its very cool that this isnt just some random Urquell knockoff (not that I expected it would be) and this brewery is a very strong 2/2 in my book. Excited to find more.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Non-typical beers will receive personalized descriptions after the express ratings.-------- />
How: Tap at Koutland, Pilsen, Czech Republic
The look: Clear golden body with a large white head
To me a typical Czech Světlý 12° and above is: Well malted body with plenty of biscuits and cereals.  Sweetness level is in the light-medium range with some honey flavours and a light caramel presence (3/4 honey, 1/4 caramel).  Fruity flavour limited to a light citrus flavour.  Medium carbonation.  Finish is dry and moderately bitter with a light citric touch.  After-taste of dry grassy/herbal hops with a light dry spiciness character.
This one: As above, a typical 12° Světlý but with everything just done almost perfectly.  As far as regular Světlý (non-oak barrel aged) this one was second only to the Svatý Norbert Velikonoční 13°.

4513,"2008-03-25",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2013 My Bottom Line:
Herbal tangerine hoppiness swings its fresh hips to the delight of the honeyed hay which cannot help but join in the dance up close to create an immensely refreshing and snappy Světlý Leák.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A trustworthy head of foam stays atop the translucent blond.
-The grassy, herbal hoppiness even recalls fresh dill at times.
-The hop bitterness is scrumptiously long but the malt knows how to keep it in check at all times.
-This is a tad more intense in its hoppiness than the usual Bohemian Pilsener, but it is by no means aggressive, nor is it an IPA version of the style.
-I feel privileged to have been able to spend an entire evening drinking pints of this, over and over and over. Thats a sign I liked it, right? ;)
