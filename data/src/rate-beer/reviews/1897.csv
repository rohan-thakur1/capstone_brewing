1897,"2015-09-11",3.1,"It is a real persistent foam I first notice. The aroma is caramel malt with hints of nuts and invite really to no good beer. It has rich caramel flavor, again slightly nutty, but it is the malt that is the main theme of this lovely beer where both caramel and roasted malt almost beaten to satisfy my taste buds. Next, the slightly nondescript fruity transition to the hops. Now Im not a big hop expert in terms of hops, but its hop bitterness is gentle and never sharp in bitterness. This indicates that the hops are selected with care and that the brewery has managed to achieve exactly the hops balance in quantity and taste that fits just perfectly in this beer. I experienced also a softness and different feeling in the beer character. I can only venture a guess that this is because the local waters high quality i northern Sweden.","Valby, DENMARK","TorbenJensen"

1897,"2012-02-20",3.8,"500mL bottle, courtesy of blomster. Thanks, Christer! Pours clear, somewhere between a dark tan and a light cola color; light-tan head with solid retention and persistent lacing. The aroma is malt-forward, showing toffee and cola and hints of darker caramel, with the hop character seeming on the periphery of the nose: minerals, earthiness, present but the opposite of assertive citrus. A perfect presence in the mouth: well-attenuated maltiness, rich caramel and toffee and a nuttiness without being cloying; the core bitterness shows through more than the aroma suggests: mineral and earthy, with a robust floral quality that wasnt overt in the nose. Medium-high CO2, medium to medium-light body, and just a nice balance between restrained malts and English-style hopping. Yum. Theres even a soft hint of smokiness or darker roast towards the finish; ends nicely bitter and on the dry side, with a hint of tea.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Ruby-toned brown body topped by shy off-white/tan head that recedes to thin, large-bubbled cover. Flowery hops up front are subsumed with caramel and toffee malt flavours before returning in the very dry, slightly puckering bitter finish. Light body, low carbonation, a bit watery perhaps. Seems more like an Amber Ale. Bottle sampled with MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere. Thanks, Per!","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"

1897,"2004-12-05",3.6,"Clear dark brown pour. Gentle white head ring. Waffle-like sweetness fails to counter the huge grapefruity hops in the nose. Slightly earthy too. Very dry palate with a deep hoppiness, not quite chalky, but its in that league. Grapefruity, mineral. So dry you feel youre drinking this from a rock made glass. A bit watery texture, but you can feel from the beer that quality water was used. Light-medium body, light carbonation. Pretty good! Another pleasant consequence of Pers visit, thanks!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1897,"2004-10-02",4.1,"Medium sized bubbles, light brown foam, and dark red-brown colour. Lots of foam and a massive crater!

The beer has got a strong, typical smell for an un-pasteurized brew: Lots of diacetyl and an almost chemical smell of malt.

The carbon oxide is fresh and surprisingly strong for an ale, but it works OK with the firm mix of malts.

The bitterness is almost perfect: Strong and robust. Yet, it doesnt get out of hand but it balances the complex blend of malts (Goldings and Caramel, I think) in a great way. There are some tones of fruit and a passing hint of parfume. The long aftertaste is first dominated of the sweet, buttery taste of the malts but after some time, the hops rises to the surface followed by a little sweetness. 

A very skilfully crafted ale, recommended to all lovers of this style. Frankly, I am impressed of the small Jämtlands Bryggeri, located in the north of Sweden: The Jämtlands Pilgrim can easily compete with the best British ales!

The name of this beer comes from the small village Pilgrimsstad (Pilgrims Town) where the brewery is located. The town was part of a medieval pilgrim route to the northern Norwegian town Trondheim, where the mortal remains of St. Olav (the most important saint in Scandinavia at the time) is buried.","Linköping, SWEDEN","bark"

Full bodied in the mouth with sweet chocolate dominated at first, then a roast barley note developing but the hop seems more muted.

The color is nut brown and it has a beutiful bubbly beige head. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of nuts and caramel which turns hoppy bitter in the middle just to end on a note of malty dryness coming from roasted and chocolate malt that lingers.
