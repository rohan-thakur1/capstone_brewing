2598,"2017-05-05",3.8,"Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, Belgian yeast, orange, figs, hops, citrus and spices.

Appearance:

Turbid/opaque amber/orange beer with heavy yeast and with a medium/large off-white head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel, Belgian yeast, orange and figs; ends slightly bitter and dry with hops, citrus and spices.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Feels like a mix between a regular Belgian ale and a Saison. That fig juice adds a mostly sweet flavour and a very slight tart that I would simply describe with spices. A great appearance and palate as well, but the aroma could have been stronger.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"
2598,"2017-04-28",4.0,"750 ml caged and corked bottle, no date I could find on it. Served in a Blaugies chalice, the beer pours an orange/amber color with a couple inch off-white head that stuck around for a while. Theres a small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and earthy, the brew smells like wheat/grainy malt, grassiness, figs, peppery spice and some citrus. Taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also some white grape and apple (both sweet and tart) flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, its high but soft carbonation makes it creamy, smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a good overall brew, I liked it. Certainly worth picking up!","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

No, he said, it is more like a budget shoe shop, so quite leathery. Then I thought of a little river in the Alp mountains, with its dusty aromas, stone, slight salty water, mud. But in the end, we agreed it smelled like the local wooden shoe seller in the middle of nowhere, the same middle of nowhere where we grew up. Did we smoke a lot? No, not really, just an Alaskan Smoked Porter, which was great. Anyway, I would describe the aroma as chlorine, salty, mud, hint of oak wood, leather.

Smooth, slightly bitter beginning with subtle fruitiness, which then gets intensified due to a chewy sourness. Slightly stings the tongue, then dough yeast softens the fruit impression, opening up the palate for bready malts, adding a decent complexity and balance to the beer. Yeast stays visible till the end, reminding me almost of a Witbeer, which is only partly true, because vivid fruits still add a sour hint, assisted by high carbonation. A bit too watery, neither of the flavors is convicing on themselves, they do mix up well, but could use a little push to intensify the overall flavor.","GERMANY","aleigator"

2598,"2013-04-24",4.0,"Undated 750 ml corked bottle served in a St. Bernardus snifter.  
Pours a hazy, orange-amber color that is topped by well-proportioned, thick, bone colored head. This beer is highly carbonated as can be seen and felt, although the carbonation is nicely soft. The glass gets fully coated with lace with each tip.  Lively but not harsh or aggressive feel, with a semi-dry finish. 

Aroma: Floral and quite fruity with hints of figs, and plums.  Esters suggest a higher ABV than 5.8%.  There is a light spiciness and some earthiness from, I suspect, both hops and yeast.

Taste: Fruity, with a finely mix of sweet and tart plus a faint bitterness.  As I often find in pale Belgians, the taste is notably better than the aroma.  Tart citrus and vague mixed fruits upfront until the finish, with the figs coming out more clearly in the finish and aftertaste.  Hints of banana, white pepper, clove, and nutmeg, but the spiciness is subtle and not due, I believe, to any added spices. This exceptional ale is enticingly complex and dynamic.

The brew pours a crystal clear, pure, dark amber color with effervescing, Champagne-like bubble streams.  A thin, ultra-smooth blanket of cream colored foam settles in at the surface.  Wet lacing forms big, drooping arches.  Aromas include a dry caramel malt base, with notes of fig, dried prune, and raisin lending deep, concentrated, fruity sweetness.  Scents of day old bread, funked-out, earthy oak, peppery spice, and faded floral hopping complete the unique and complex nose.  The flavor is very dusty and wrought with wild yeast, earthy as can be, with tart, almost sour, fruity overtones.  I must say that the combination comes off as being a bit plastic-like, but that might very well be due to the advanced age of this particular beer.  Fig and golden raisin again show quite prominently.  The palate is medium bodied, dry, and lively effervescent.  This is a weird one.  Not bad....just weird.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

2598,"2008-11-18",3.7,"I split this beer, the last of those that I brought back from Belgium in my wooden leg, with SurlySober. I was initially dismayed by what I would characterize as a large amount of sediment at the bottom of the bottle, but with careful pouring what ended up in my glass was pretty attractive - golden and lightly effervescent. Aroma was floral and a touch spicy, and reinforced my initial champagne-like impression. Flavor was very malty for a Belgian ale with lots of baking bread notes and yeastiness. Mouthfeel was quite light and pleasant. I thought it to be quite good.

Green fruity grapeskin flavor, dry and peppery with a dry lemon finish. A distinctly old-fashioned sort of beer, unexpectedly rustic even for a saison, and even for Blauges.

Gigantic pop of the cork yields a massive head, very cloudy mud orange with a pat of yeast sitting on top. Aroma is fairly standard, fresh bakery, juicy, spicy yeast. The flavor shines though, with an up front punch of juice and a wispy smokiness right in the middle that Ive never found in a Belgian before. Finish is mostly dry and unmistakenly Belgian.

Light musty, earthy nose from the yeast, fruity smells of green apples and grapes, orange zest, soft sweetness from the fig juice, medicinal herbal aromas that mesh with the alcohol, an enticing start.

Medicinal herbs and a dry Noble spiciness at the end. Finishes dry, traces of toasted caramel, herbal spiciness and a mild yeastiness.

Pours a clear amber with a white head that grows the more aggressive you pour. Nose is muted. I get freshly cut grass as well as mild yeast. On the flavor I get an almost minty/citric start that quickly leads to an even and mild pale ale middle body that ends with what I think are the brews strongest traits leaning towards figs. I am giving this one a 4.5 on taste because even though it isnt an explosive experience, it is definitely unique and finely crafted. Mouthfeel is good. Not mindblowing, but not mediocre at the same time. Very drinkable. Worth visiting and worth visiting again (better yet...with a friend).","Brooklyn, New York, USA","RblWthACoz"

2598,"2006-07-24",4.1,"2005 bottle (75cL), Bordeaux glass, roughly room temperature.  The head is frothy and rocky, quite firm and immense at first pour.  Just beneath is a hazy body with shades ranging from gold to peach to orange.  Huge sourdough bread notes open the affair slamming right into elements of orange zest and a dusty cellar.  Peppery hops and/or yeast tones abound.  Figs sit comfortably in the back row, allowing their characteristic nuttiness to show through on occasion.  Herbal cilantro, nearly minty, aromas come on late as the beer warms, as does a hint of strap leather.  Really a well integrated Saison-ish aroma with no jagged edges and smile-inducing complexity.  If the figs were in the back row in the aroma, theyve taken off their clothes and are running about the theater in the flavor.  So to speak.  Upfront, bready malts are straddled by zesty citric acidity and a tart yeastiness.  Mid-palate is full of sour, almost funky earthen elements and herbal characteristics.  The herbs carry into the finish, which happens to be quite peppery, and all of it dries out into an incredibly long, nutty aftertaste.  Easily carrying enough oomph to make me guess around 7 or 8 % abv, Im surprised to see such a sturdy brew in such a modest cloak.  Very soft mouthfeel, carrying no mineral roughness, almost velvet like.  Carbonation is intense--thankfully, considering the intense flavors and the building, plum sweetness at the front of my tongue.

2598,"2006-01-30",3.4,"2004 Cork date, Sampled January 2006
Pours a hazy, perfectly amber color that is topped by a frothy, three-finger thick, light tan colored head.  This beer is incredibly carbonated and the head starts to form a rocky surface as it falls slowly down.  The aroma is quite fruity with definite notes of fig, raisins, and even some notes of plum.  There is a light spiciness underneath the fruit, including a slight note of ginger, perhaps some orange zest, and a bit of clove.  The aroma is predominantly dominated by the fruit character, I was quite surprised by how evident the fig is, it is quite nice.

The first sip foams up and is generally lost in a frothy mass of bubbles.  So I just released a bit of the excess carbonation.  The beer is quite light on the tongue.  There is a light sweetness up front, which plays up a soft fruity character.  Unlike the nose, I would not necessarily associate the fruit flavors with figs.  I do get notes of red grapes, and perhaps some currants and some notes of apple, but not much in the way of figs, except a solid non-descript fruitiness.  There is a bit of spiciness here as well, though it is definitely not quite enough to balance the fruit notes.  There are notes of subtle ginger, pepper, and some notes of clove.

In the end this beer is just not quite complex enough.  The fruit character is nice, but it needs a bit of complexity somewhere to balance the fruit out, obviously a bit more spicy Saison-like yeasty notes would be more than welcome.  This beer is still quite tasty, and certainly drinkable, it just seems a bit too one dimensional.

2598,"2004-08-13",3.7,"This cloudy amber ale pours with a nice brownish-white head, like a farmhouse or saison ale. The fig juice adds a slight fruity flavor, but is not overpowering. I followed a fresh bottle with one I had aged for over two years (by mistake), and found that most of  the flavor had disappeared, so drink it fresh. This rating applies to the fresh bottle only.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
2598,"2004-08-06",3.5,"Brewtopia [04.  Peachy color, substantial white head.  Malty and quite sweet, fruit-syrupy.  Ends rather abruptly, acidic.  Sticky lace.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
2598,"2004-07-27",3.6,"Murky orange brown in color with a large off white head that is nicely retained.  Aroma is slightly funky with a bit of dustiness and some light fruit and yeast.  YUM!  This is a dry, carbonated beverage.  Flavor is quite restained with some light maltiness a bit of yeast and just enough funk to bring a bit of interest.  Not as good as La Moneuse, but still a very nice summer ale.","Bedford, Texas, USA","TChrome"
2598,"2004-07-23",3.3,"Bottle conditioned, (750ml) from Dranken Geers via John White. Hazy amber, good longlasting fluffy white head and gentle condition. Muted sweet yeast and caramel in the nose with a touch of fruitiness. Slightly tangy and fruity in the mouth, quite thin with a metallic edge. Any fig notes where lost on me. Finish is malty and has a yeast dryness. Nothing special.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
2598,"2004-07-17",3.3,"(Bottled, 0.375l) Muddy (with yeast), amber-orange color with medium, foamy head. Earthy, dry and fruity aroma. Sourish, fruity (apple juice) and yeasty flavor. Medium-bodied, quite carbonated palate. Not my style of beer, but quite drinkable anyway.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"
2598,"2004-07-08",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2005 Plump figs contribute to the citrusy hay aroma...Fluffiness almost overtakes the crunchy wheat and creates a dryness in the feel...Creative simplicity in the Belgian countryside...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
2598,"2004-07-05",4.2,"Sweet hay, mild camomile, citrus lemon and gentle earthy barnyard aroma. Opaque golden with orange-white head that recedes to cover. Plenty of yeast in suspension. Flavour is fruity, yeasty, and quite herbal  with earthy balancing bitterness. Very structured, fluffy, medium-light body with noticeable though light carbonation on the tongue. Very enjoyable. Bottle (enjoyed with MartinT, Rastacouere and some non-RB tasters).","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
2598,"2004-07-05",3.6,"Brewtopia 04. Orange color with nice sized head. Aroma of dried fruits and yeast. Lively mouthfeel, very carbonated. Malty taste that turns almost sour. I was told by a rep that there was fig syrup added to this which could explain some of the sweetness. Nice lacing throughout.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
2598,"2004-07-05",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 8, 2004 Superb off-white head with huge foamy lacing levitates above the light amber murky hue. Terrific looking! Aroma comes out extremely yeasty (sawdust, cobwebs), but well balanced by passion fruit notes (mango, figs, grapes). Very fruity on the tongue, dusty yeast, woody. Light citric acidity from the start to the beginning, balancing farmy bitterness in the second half. Yeasty aftertaste with a bit of malty acidity. Mouthfeel is top notch, meringous-like, very bubbly, airy, foamy. A contemplative and unique ale with tremendous garage character to set apart from other belgian ales.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2598,"2004-06-28",3.8,"This bottled corked and caged sample poured a extremely large sized invigorated head of foamy finely sized off-white colored long lasting bubbles that left behind an average lacing.  The body was a softly carbonated hazy dark yellow color.  The aroma was fruity with apricot dusty musty yeasty doughy notes to it.  The mouth feel was mildly tingly and smooth with a lingering malt dough aftertaste.  The flavor contained notes of malts mild hops yeast dough and mild fruits.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
2598,"2004-06-26",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2004 2003 750mL bottle.  Pours a rusty orange-amber with some dark yellows and golds.  Good light yellow head with lots of sediment flecks, quite hazy and of course, bottle conditioned.  Aroma of honey, almonds, coriander or light curacao, mild but flavorful yeast and a light but tart yellow/green fruit smell.  Flavor is lightly sweet, hints of toffee and light caramel with plenty of dough, almost like a raisin oatmeal cookie.  The yeast is not very funky yet, making me somewhat regret my decision to open this young.  Still, a well-balanced, mild flavor, a touch of wateriness, lots more malt on the finish and a good, moderately carbonated medium-full body.  Very drinkable, dripping with quality.  I would have NEVER guessed figs. . . .","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2598,"2004-04-30",3.1,"Really nothing special in my book. I really expected more. Decent color and active head that went away as quickly as it came. Nose was grassy. Medium body and nothing else to make it stand ouot. Fig juice? Never tasted it.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
2598,"2004-04-11",4.0,"Starts with the expected Blaugies super cork shooter  - we expected that and all of us protected our eyes as it ricocheted off the ceiling.  I thought this would be darker - I was thinking of plum/prune juice maybe?  Nice golden color - slightly hazed, huge head, great lacing.  Sour/tart/yeast/herbal/pepper saison tastes with a very mild sweetness at the end - that must have been the figs.  Another winner from this tiny brewery","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
2598,"2004-03-25",3.9,"750 ml bottle, no date.  Opaque orange, giant head – lasts forever.  Strongly yeasty nose, no sweetness; Psychprof has it with sourdough.  Bit peppery.  I do taste just a hint of figgy fruitiness..relatively sweet, very yeasty, very full-bodied.  Very soft and creamy as it warms, almost biere de garde-like.  Though this was just OK at the beginning, but by the end I was totally won over.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2598,"2004-03-17",4.2,"Beautiful orange gold, with flecks of stuff milling about inside. Smells very fresh, with some sort of sourdough bread and tart fruit smell. Slightly sweet, very crisp and carbonated, thinnish but not overly so. Some metallic notes. Delicious. Less funky, somehow, then the other Blaugies.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
2598,"2004-02-22",4.0,"2000.  40% cloudy, golden body.  60% expansive, fluffy white head.  Fresh aroma of floral perfume, grass, lemon and light fruit.  A touch of funk and some herbal qualities as well.  Light, airy body with strong effervescence.  Tartness dominates the flavor.  The fig juice must be somewhat tart, as the lightly cheesy funk.  A really enjoyable beer with great flavors and new horizons.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
2598,"2004-02-08",4.0,"Creamy golden color with a nonstop head of despeckled cream colored foam. Even after pour the first glass, albeit small, I looked back to see more foam coming out of the bottle. Aromas of light citrus, mild yeast and ndertones of toasty malt and light fruit(yes, fig included). Certainly not overpowering, but one that makes you sit back and think. Light and crisp body. Light fruity start that is quietly lifted away with a the effervecience and a light grape tartness. Clean and crisp. Ever so slight malt finish brings things back.  Well brewed and an enjoyable quaff.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

2598,"2004-01-12",3.6,"(slightly aged) Very hazy golden-orange, with loads of little flecks, presenting themselves very conspiciously on the virgin-white, full head. Vegetables and a sweetness in the nose, probably due to the fig syrup. Bit sourish as well. Sourish - but not much - taste, faint spicey and some fruit. No sweetness at all in the taste - I guess due to the ageing. Young this is sweeter, betraying the fig character. Quite dry, bit sharp-sourish finish. Nice - but this is probably one of the few beers I prefer young.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
2598,"2003-11-19",3.5,"An extremely subtle, hard-to-understand ale. Poured glistening sunshine, soapy head several inches high. Sharp, puckering, vinegary/moss aroma. Heavily carbonated. I really had to get into this beer to get past the extremely subtle (some say bland) flavors of apple juice, champagne yeast and not a lot else.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
2598,"2003-11-17",4.3,"Foggy golden. Fluffy, large-bubbled dusty-white head. Fragrant, farmy aroma of lemon juice, hay, fresh flowers, earth, sponge cake, melon, and perfume. Beautifully full, yet at the same time, airy, musty, and flowery. Perfectly placed lightly spicy yeast and zingy hops. Soft medium body. More prickly than it is airy. Spicy start transitions beautifully into an elegant middle of fresh hop leaf, perfume, and flowers. Finishes round, mellow and highly appetizing with a persistently spicy,  earthy quality concluding with a light doughy yeast, spicy hop  tingle. The aroma is exquisitely mellow, touting its clean yeast character and well-utilized hop profile with fervency. Im tempted to call this a Saison. Its very farmy, elegantly funky, and perfumey. Another stunner from these garage-based brewers. Give me a plate of mussels and Im good to go.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Clear-ish golden colour. grass, yeast and apples in the aroma.
Tangy and very spritzy taste. Lime and other fruit: pears and, I suppose, figs. Slight brett aftertaste.  Warming alcohol Felt more than 5.8 ABV and probably was as it looks to be actively fermenting!","arlington, Virginia, USA","theakston"

2598,"2003-02-23",4.0,"Fresh out of the fridge, this definitely needs some settling down, as it is overly carbonated and produces a huge meringue-like head. Once warmed and aerated, its a nice golden brew, heady with aromas. Grassy, lemon-pepper, hints of various fruits, cider, toffee-malt, whiskey  and a bit of cheesy yeast. The beer is distinctly, though subtly sour, with a slightly clean finish. Classicly, farmhouse-style, this is a great refresher, especially for fans of sour ales. I preferred this over their Seasonal Moneuse, which may have been a bit stale.","Illinois, USA","DavefromChicago"
2598,"2002-11-25",4.2,"Head is initially huge, fizzy, off-white, mostly lasting.
Body is hazy light amber, dense particles of all sizes, bottle
conditioned. Aroma is moderately hoppy (flowers, grass, herbs, citrus -
lemon), moderately yeasty (barnyard, cobwebs), lightly malty (toasted
light bread), with notes of pear, cantaloupe, grape, and honey. Flavor
is moderately sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is
lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery
texture, lively carbonation, lightly astringent. A very clean, brisk,
tart, and well-balanced saison.  The rustic, comforting, nostalgic farmhouse
aroma that has steadily made me a fan of this brewery is certainly on
display here. I like this a little more every time I have it.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
