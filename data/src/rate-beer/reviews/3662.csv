Its really deep and dark brown in the glass, initially not much of a head to write home about, then it forms a medium sized deep brown top, quickly fading in to a sidesticking and bubbly thing. Could in other words have looked better. The aroma is filled with lovely whisky. Mild peaty, lots of burnt wood. Its smoky and deep roasted. Yeah, no doubt its a Dubh. Lots of flavor also, but its surprisingly watery. Both in the mouthfeel and in the taste - to my surprise. Its sharp and a tad top boozy imo. No where near the other ice had in the series. Mild dark chocolate and sweet kind of licorice. Whisky and burnt wood.

Taste: Quite peated whiskey forward along smoke, iodine, chocolate, light caramel and light fruitiness. Oak too.

Palate: Medium body. Moderate to medium carbonation. Oaky. Warming finish. 

Overall: Tasty, but a bit unbalanced because of the strong peated whisky presence. The beer seems to lack a bit of body to handle the barrel treatment properly. Im curious to try the other versions.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3662,"2015-02-21",4.1,"330 ml bottle into snifter; bottle # 05043, bottled in 4/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, leather, tobacco, peat smoke, oak, light dark fruit, and roast/smokey earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready malt and scotch barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, leather, tobacco, peat smoke, oak, light dark fruit, light vanilla, and roast/smokey earthiness. Light roast/oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, leather, tobacco, peat smoke, oak, light dark fruit/vanilla, and roast/smokey earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance, complexity, and robustness of roast/bready malt and scotch barrel flavors; with a nice roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent old ale style. All around great complexity and balance of roast/bready malt and scotch barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on. An interesting note about this vintage is it is much bolder on peat smoke and earthy leather/tobacco notes than the younger scotch vintages. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Extremely dark brown color, bright tan edge head. Aroma of dark bittersweet cocoa and a bit of vanilla. Taste starts with bittersweet cocoa, then the whisky kicks in, with its rich vanilla, smokey edge and dark fruit. Delicious.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"

Deep rich brown Ruth minor head. Beertender declared ""BEST BEER EVER"" when asked how it was.  Ranks in top 5 (3?) in my book...

One word description - smooth.  Beertender was correct in that it has the wonderful taste of a good beer, coffee, and  chocolate without any inkling of alcohol burn.  

Damn - I want a third, but have to get back to work...   Damn.....

3662,"2013-05-30",4.3,"Draft. Great Scott. Nice beer that is a bit overpowering but gets better with each sip and beer. Roasted malts at first. Some peat aftertaste. Chocolate. The roast is too much at first but gets better as u drink.  Do not miss the chance for it.
