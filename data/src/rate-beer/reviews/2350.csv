2350,"2015-05-31",3.6,"Purchased from Cigarette City, Saturday evening. $15.99 for the 750 mL bottle. 
 
On front label, it reads: ""Bottling January 2015. Cases bottled 455."" 8.3% alcohol by volume. 

To long-stemmed white wine glass, it pours a dark umber mauve-tinted mahogany with which a creamy, vanilla creme head 1 finger in length stood.
Aromas of fusels/nail polish, melted wax, dates, walnuts, burnt cardboard, pipe tobacco, aloe vera, and minerals. Tastes much the same with the addition of DME, damp pumpernickel, and toasted breadcrumbs. 
Hints of powdered cinnamon, sweat, bay leaves, and Belgian yeast experienced by swallow.
Mouthfeel was haltingly slick, but the flavors lingered for a minutes before I had to take another sip to keep the memory formed in place. 
Allagash, it seems, are incapable of releasing anything bad; mediocre or dull, perhaps, but I genuinely dont remember drinking anything from these brewers I would consider as being ""terrible"".So, if youre looking for a pumpernickel-y/bready/dark cola-y Belgian-forward beer, this should be perfect for your tastes.

There is a mixture of aromas with the roasted malt and chocolate playing out first then leading to spicy yeast with a minor background of sourness. The flavor is robust and complex and taste as though there is bits of milk chocolate in the flavor along with yeast that made me ponder the taste of a German dunkelweizen, but it most certainly is a Belgian yeast due to the spiciness and heat involved. This barrel aged ale covers up the wood flavor a lot and hides it quite well making me have to dig it out in my palate.

Shorter than normal review.  Pours dark with sticky head.  Aroma pretty neutral tony nose. Agree with review below, kind of malty wheat then sweeter on back end.  Less malty sweetness than I would hope and more of a grainy wheat element.  Nothing wrong with this but nothing distinguishing to me.  Coming from a Belgian Strong Ale fan.

Thanks to tastybeer for sharing this. Its been while since I tried something new from Allagash. This was a passable release. Ill continue to try a few new things but it might be a while yet before I revisit this East Coast brewery.

Aroma / Appearance - The carbonated base looks like melted chocolate which has been watered down to keep it from thickening up. An ivory head looks like frosty icing. Smoky bacon, chestnuts, and peat give this a malty profile. If there are any hops they are well masked.

Flavor / Palate - Smoky chocolate is the first impression of a mildly complex beer. It lingers for a while before fading to nothing. More presence would help this greatly. As it stands I kept looking for more and not finding it. Also if there was any barrel aging it too is hidden.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The aroma is quite complex, offering prunes, charred malt, smoke, oak, roast, figs, dates, nuts, malt, yeast, spice. Certainly an intriguing beer for the olfactory senses.

Nose: interesting and intriguing. Chocolate and plum, Hersheys chocolate and ruby port. Smell of the seasons changing to Fall. Grape and plum pomace  stems, skins, and pits. Faint oak planks underneath, almost as an afterthought. Fresh black cherries resting in their own juices with no additives or preservatives. Touch of leather in the back along with more pomace  makes me imagine what the old leather Madera sacks of yore may have smelled like after years of use.

Palate: wow! Subtle and soft, sophisticated and aristocratic. Chocolate and leather, pomace, black cherries both in essence and fresh juice. The pomace lingers in the back of each swallow along with old wine soaked oak. More cherries and chocolate with the addition of red and black grapes. Bakers chocolate teases the top back middle of my tongue. More oak comes out to play as she warms up with campfire and fireplace designs.

How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed about 1 year after bottling date
The look: Near black body topped by a light brown ring of foam
In long: Strange nose of black liquorice, pineapples and tar.  Taste has plenty of dark fruits, a lot of toffee, raisins, black liquorice candy, lots of vanilla, barley candy, wheat wine, Belgian yeast sensation, some tobacco leafs. Very little oak presence (if any) for an oak aged beer.  There was some dryness in the finish which can only be explained by the wood.  But not really any oak flavor per say.  Body is full, carbonation is lively but mouthfeel is a bit sticky.  Alcohol is very well hidden.  This is a beer I didnt really care for in the first 1/4th of the bottle but it grew on me and before the end of the bottle I was enjoying it.  This is a good thing because usually big beers do the opposite to me.  Style-wise its a touch one to pigeonhole.  Kind of a big Belgian crossed with a scotch ale.  Overall this is a good beer.

D: Better as it warms up past cellar temperature, but nothing terribly special at this point. Its lacking in any real depth, which is surprising given that the bottle is nearly a year old.

Overall:  The beer is balanced, but really underwhelming for such a fancy expensive beer. There are plenty of other Allagash beers I would pluck off the shelf before this one.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

2350,"2010-05-07",3.7,"City Beer Store, Allagash night.  Very dark ruby/brown beer with a great big head, beige with lots of lacing.  I always have a hard time describing Allagashs beers; theres some subtlety thats difficult to put into words.  The beer builds on a clean grain flavor with big caramel/brown sugar and fruity malt notes, raisins and plums.  Theres some definite dark malt presence, as well.  Chocolate and light coffee add some very interesting touches.  Lots of oak and definite bourbon (better than Curieux but still a tad odd, in my opinion).  Carbonation is relatively light.  Flavor is fairly sweet.  It doesnt quite come together for me, but its an interesting and obviously well-made beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Like the aroma, picking up oak and woody bark flavors in the taste with a little dry cocoa and dark fruit flavors.
Good carbonation and medium bodied -- not as heavy as the dark color might indicate. No signs of the 10% ABV, very smooth going down. As the bartender joked, ""This is so smooth, Id give to my mom"". Would pair well with sharp cheese or a hearty stew.","Miamisburg, Ohio, USA","chaz01"
2350,"2010-04-26",4.3,"Bottled July 09. Poured into my Duvel tulip glass.

A-Body is a nearly opaque dark brown-cola color. Pours with a 2-3 finger foamy off-white head that fades quickly to a thin collar. Leaves minimal lacing behind in the glass. Bubbles can be seen steadily rising to the top.

S-Impressions of anise, cola, and root beer come through initially with a slight spicy yeast overtone. Phenols can be detected at a moderate strength.

T-Much like the nose the overall impression this brew gives off initially is that of root beer, anise, and cola. A wet oak presence is minimal in the background. After a few sips a spicy belgian yeast comes through and blends well with the initial flavors. The finish is spicy and sweet with the slightest hints of molasses and oak coming through as well as a moderate alcohol warmth.

P-Medium to high tingly carbonation and a light to medium weight body. Body is wet and yeasty but there is a slight phenolic consistency as well.

O- This is a great beer overall. ABV still somewhat detectable but not out of check in any way, shape or form. I wish there was a bit more oak barrel presence as well. Overall I think this is a great brew and great example of BSDA and measures well against the greats of the style.

2350,"2009-07-20",4.4,"750mL bottle, dated February 2005.  Poured a lovely shade of burnt garnet with a thick, easily-resuscitated cap of mid tan head.. surprisingly clear, but it was lovely.  The aroma did anything but dissapoint.. rich vinous notes and aged molasses were accented by brown sugar, vanilla, and faint cocoa powder.. no oxidation evident, but it definitely became sweeter and deeper with age.. I lost about 8 minutes with my nose in the glass.  The flavor opened with black pepper spicage and redder fruit skins, really mellowing out rather than becoming sharp.. brown sugar, aged caramel, and molasses were found on the core, laced with sweeter chocolates.. light peppery and oaky notes, dried cherries, and earth surrounded.. warm, but not hot on the finish with the same excellent malt bill.

The nose is typical of oak-aged dark Belgian Strongs, with candied red fruits, fig, roasted malts, oak, but unique to this Belgian, is the element of smoke.

The oakiness from the barrel really adds a nice element of complexity an char. The bitterness from the roasted malt and hops is perfectly suited and the combination of flavours that cross style boudaries.

2350,"2008-06-26",4.3,"750ml caged&corked bottle. Pours a deep brown like a cherry/mahagony wood stain with a minimal (though very long-lasting) light tan head that leaves occasional, thick, tendrils of lace on parts of the glass. Aroma is complex and interesting. My first impression was, ""bacon?"" from a distinct, though far from overpowering, smokiness combined with malt sweetness that subtly resembles maple. Layers of malt sweetness with caramel and chocolate follow along with a big whiff of alcohol. There are notes of dried cherry in the aroma, too, along with a subtle woody character. The flavor starts rich in roasted and caramel character - like robust porter. There is a hint of smokiness - much less than alluded to by the aroma. The smokiness actually blends well and accentuates the roasted grain character. The second wave of flavors is fruity with esters. As the beer nears the middle of the tongue, notes of Scotch whiskey (dry, a little smoke, alcohol) emerge. There is a nice dryness with notes of chocolate. Very complex, very tasty, and very nice. The mouthfeel is medium-full in body, slippery, with tendrils of thickness. The carbonation is decent, but low for strong Belgian ales - but in a good way as the lack of extreme bubbles makes the beer softer on the palate and helps bring attention to the complex layers of flavor herein. Overall - another knockout from Allagash. These beers are really pricey (~$13/bottle - $20 for Interlude!) but so worth it - so much better than buying a $13 bottle of wine (which is pretty common).","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Wonderful aroma, it jumps out of the bottle as soon as it is popped, following from the pour into the glass and all the way out to my chair, this beer has filled the air.  The yeast strain is very aggressive in the nose, followed by the barrel aged toastiness coming in a close 2nd.  Lots of fruit on the palate along with alcohol, and some of the bready maltiness gets drowned in that, giving this kind of a harsh astrigency.

2350,"2008-06-01",4.2,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle, vintage 2008.  Warm, oaky, mahogany appearance with lightning formation of resilient, creamy light brown foam.  Smoky, meaty, lightly tart aroma; an initial burst of cherry tobacco and silkier cavendish, sparky and tangy with barbecue tones underneath.  Strawberry jam.  Bittersweet chocolate, raisins, vanilla, apples, and brandy round out this sophisticated, textured interplay of decadent and sprightly; really an intriguing, gorgeously nuanced, challenging aroma.

Dry tobacco and erudite spirit flavor; alcoholic but never hot, and offering the silky nuances of toasted oak but not its sometimes startling sweetness.  Warm chocolate, raisiny cavendish smoke, syrupy wooden sweetness, and an angelically pure vanilla presence gaining a particular shimmer toward the mid palate; big brown sugar and roasted red fruit notes.  The oak imparation is so soft and full throughout, and really seems to be the perfect companion for the rich, roasty tobacco touch that first characterizes it.  
 
Full body is lightly frothy and very dense; softly carbonated and approachable, calling to mind the pristine balance and gentle strength of the trappists.  Finishes with some oaky alcohol touch, recalling both a warm, fireside scotch and a no holds barred, wildly hot, fruity zinfandel, and a dusty chocolate density.

2350,"2008-06-01",4.1,"750mL bottle, January 2008 bottling.  Pours a very dark cola color; fluffy, light-khaki head with excellent retention and lacing that coats the glass: medium-sized, tightly packed lines of bubbles at the edges of the glass, regenerative from below.  Soft barrel presence in the aroma: cola, dried dark fruits, warming, toasty vanilla; a really nice balance between the dried fruits of the Belgian core and the vanilla from the wood; some raisins and dates.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: gorgeous vanilla notes layered over a cola and dried fruit core; nothing sticky here, nothing unfocused: reminiscent of a coke float: creamy vanilla layered with dry cola notes and sweet (again, nothing sticky) candy / cotton candy sugar; gorgeous, chewy, generous barrel-aged beer.  The vanilla presence is lovely: toasty, and lacking the buttery notes typically seen from bourbon barrels.  Lengthy finish: cola, toasty vanilla, and soft breadiness.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

The aroma is largely vanilla and oak, with a slight fruit and smoky characteristic thrown in.  The flavor is the same, but overall it seems this beer is a bit confused.  The flavors, vanilla, oak, plum, raisin, yeast, grape, and so forth, seem to crash into each other at times rather than subtly sliding and dancing across the tongue as in many Allagash brews.  The alcohol is more noticeable here than in others Ive tried from Allagash.  Good, but not in the same league as their best.","North Bellmore, New York, USA","thenick"
2350,"2007-07-02",3.9,"Cloudy dark brown with violet and crimson hues. A booming light beige head has fantastic retention and imparts thick, eye-catching lacing. The aroma is very vinous, very alluring and very tangled. A mosaic of port, oak, vanilla, smoke and plums usher in the nose. Theyre followed by aromas of grapes, whisky, tobacco, caramel and raisins. Awesome, though somewhat convoluted and too dynamic to pin down any forward-motioning allignment of scents that result in one ultimate melding of the aroma. Its a novel nose, sure, but it struggles to get any foothold that would set a precedent for a relaxing style of analysis. Alcohol is moderately masked. The flavor is where integration happens. More smoke and dark fruit notes coalesce, with additions of heavy yeastiness parading to the fore. Bitterness is light to mild, acidity is very light and sparkling. Sweetness is too heavy but the flavor remains wonderful. Port notes are almost tangible, visible. The barrel and vanilla notes are now enshrouded by sweet malts and warmth that steadily builds from alcohol with each sip. The finish is spicy, thickening and lengthy, sweet and vinous. Mouthfeel is sticky and somewhat syrupy, my only real complaint. Full bodied and well carbonated, enough dancing bubbles to alleviate some of the sticky nature of this copious malt attack. Incredibly interesting and quite tasty. Wheat? What wheat? I absolutely love the flavor of this but find that sipping very slowly is the only way I enjoy it. I dont think I could drink a whole bottle myself, which doesnt seem to be a challenge with other Allagash beers.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

The flavor is actually pretty thin for such a big beer.  Moderately sweet malt and candied dark fruits up front.  Finishes with some light smoke, oak, plum, grape, and alcohol.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly cloying and sticky finish.  Typical Allagash carbonation, a little too fizzy and prickly, especially for this style.

2350,"2007-02-14",3.4,"Once again, the balance and integrity of a well made Allagash is nearly destroyed by the intensity of the oaking.  Lovely hazy medium brown, small dark tan head.  Overwhelming nose offers great promise ... chocolate, dark roast, dried fruits.  Mouthfeel surprisingly thin, given the explosive nose, but consistent with the appearance.  Taste is really complex ... chocolate, Belgian yeast, dried fruit, but it still screams of oak and, for some reason licorice.  Alcohol nicely masked, but still lacking in balance.  As with the Musette, anything this expensive and with this much alcohol needs to be wonderful or I wont go near it.  Ill probably pour out 3/4 of the bottle and give away the rest of the case.

Taste is of the mentioned aromas.  The balance seemed to be slightly skewed towards the oakiness and leaning away from the Belgian goodness but overall, its enjoyable and very well done.
Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, sugary, medium bodied with mild carbonation and a semi-dry finish.  Some may think its a bit ""thin"" but its the dryness from the oak tannins that gives them this initial reaction.
The abv is evident after a few sips and it makes you wonder whether or not the beer was soaked in used bourbon barrels.  The barrels were newly toasted American oak so the caramelized bourbony flavors are all derived from the beer combined with the oak.  Nice.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"

Delicious wheat malt and oak taste, a mix of toasted grain and roasted dark malts, that Belgian candied sugariness, slightly nutty, oak woody with traces of vanilla, a butter toffee flavor emerges in the middle, the alcohol has a fermented taste, so it stays in the background, mingling with the malts and provides a warming presence in the palate, and a dry oaky, yeasty, malty finish.

Heavenly aroma of vinous-like oak decorated in lots of dark nuances of dark fruity malt, black licorice, tootsie roll chocolate, carob, vanilla, and a splash of good Ol alcoholic breath.

Taste has an emaculately creamy front thats airy and rounded with a full brunt of dark fruity malts. Has a short stay middling area of chocolate and date flavors. Lively and full on the swallow with warmth and alcoholic texture bringing a breeze of vanilla and port flavors. Hints to carob, root beer, black licorice and, anise. Finishes great with great length and memory with a leftover melting pot of rich chocolate laced with dark fruityness and sticky maltyness and lightly fluffed with some cocoa powder composition. Its much more complex then what Im able to describe and soak in, but take my word for it. Its damn good!

Feel is a very solid medium body with a uniform ride of interchanging full areas gliding from point to point, as do warming qualities, creamyness, smoothness, and maltyness. Looong finishing area, it sticks with you for a day and a half. A very complexing texture and character to this beer. Quite spectacular!

Wood chips mix with alcohol in a slightly harsh aroma, while caramel scented bread pudding undertones offer significant depth.  Very nice, tingly carbonation  reminds me a of a well aged Trappist (Achel Extra).  Though the aroma is strong with alcohol, the flavours only hint at the strengthit is more full of juicy raisins, lightly bitter hop flowers, prunes, honey covered cherries, vanilla, orange rinds and burnt oak.  The finish is very fruity  blueberries, boysenberries, and bittersweet strawberries.

2350,"2006-02-03",3.4,"February 2005 Bottling, Sampled January 2006
Pours quite dark, as I am pouring it, it shows a deep amber-brown color that is pretty clear.  The beer sits a dark espresso color and is topped by frothy tan colored head that is initially two-fingers thick.  As I pour this beer I immediately get notes of oak and alcohol mixed together.  The oak is definitely the dominant note here, it smells woody with mixed notes of buttery oak, and hints of vanilla, and some sort of note that reminds me of cola.  Underneath the oak is a nice fruitiness that reminds me of raisins.  The combination of the vanilla oak notes and the malt remind me of some sort of fresh bready pastry or muffin perhaps.

The taste is initially quite dry up front, but has a certain fullness and amount of body to it, that seems like it might be contributed from the oak & tannins.  The body has a soft creaminess to it that is accentuated by a soft vanilla note.  This beer hides its alcohol quite well, and even the oak is not so egregious as to be overwhelming.  The oak is definitely pretty prominent here, buttery oak is foremost, but there is a woody almost nutty note as well.  As in the aroma I get a certain note here that reminds me of cola, interesting and it seems to work here.

While the oak is not too dominant in this beer, I think that it is a bit too much.  There is not enough of the rich beer notes that I would like to see. The malt is too subtle underneath the oak; perhaps a bit of caramel and a certain fullness that I would attribute to malt character.  This is certainly drinkable, and I would even want a few more bottles of this to age for a couple of years.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Bold entrance on the palate, the rich, roasty, lush and fruity flavor floods the gates, and breaks down the door. Bourbon-y feel dominates the mouthfeel.

Taste is sweet, brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, light plum.  Surprisingly mild alcohol warming in the finish.  Medium-full body that is much thinner than the bourbon its flavor suggests.

Very enjoyable.","Jeannette, Pennsylvania, USA","dolemike1"

The taste is complex with mixes of oak, musk, wiskey and why do I want to say, tree bark or sap. I really cant descibe what heaven this brew is to drink. This recipe has to have been passed on to Allagash brewers by some ancient Druid sect living in the Maine woods.

2350,"2005-04-21",3.5,"750 ml corked an caged bottle. Bottled February 2005. Deep dark ruby tinged brown body. The tan head is fizzy, collapses quickly, and rather uninspired looking. The aroma is loaded with oak (light to medium toast) vanilla, sweet apple, some light bourbon (which is odd since it is aged in new barrels. maybe some of the Curieux spilled into it. =) ). Further aromas include toasty malt and light dusty yeast. The alcohol (other than the sweet bourbon tones) is fairly subdued in the nose. The flavor is interesting. Its hard to pin down as the wheat notes really mix things up. The oak is here in spades but some bitter cocoa and bourbon. The flavor is not as nice as the aroma and the bourbon is again strong. I guess I expected less bourbon with the virgin barrel since wines aged in this manner do not taste like bourbon. Dry fizzy palate. Light to medium alcohol warmth on the journey down the gullet.

I dont know if it was the setting, the blues music, the company (boboski & Wendy), the extra year spent in the bottle, my buzz, or what, but the second time I sampled this beer was definitely the charm.

Hazy, dark orange ale with a mid-sized, frothy, lightly tanned head. The aroma is, by far, the star of the show.  Very oaky chardonnay with notes of cocoa, dried plum and a touch of lemon. The relatively high ABV is fairly well-hidden in the well-balanced, woodsy, chocolatey flavor. Undertone of sourmash whiskey. I didnt get any of the distracting sweetness that turned off my Canadian friends at the Extreme Beer Festival in Boston, MA. Medium-bodied and fizzy. Short, lightly bitter, medium-dry finish.

Sampled at 10:50am at the Allagash Brewery, and this was the correct approach to starting the day! 
Ahh Allagash served us up what they call, a dark wheat aged in oak, and it was a rather nice blend indeed. Poured a rusty brown body and a flaky brunette head. The aroma and flavor hit with serious notions of the cask. Large submissions of oak and vanilla that had been leached from the wood; hints of almond and a bit of black pepper intermingle with mention of smoke and cherry. There was a delicate yeasty tartness in the finish, but it was lightly covered with hints of raisin and toasted barley. The palate wasnt forceful, rather light and stringy, but just enough vigor for a breakfast treat.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

Aroma of sweet toasty dark caramel and complex vanilla notes.  Body starts sweet and caramely malty with a touch of drier woody oak and earthy complexity.  A nicely balanced, well-aged brew.

On tap on 1/30/05: Poured a dark mahogany brown with a nice, well-lacing whispy light tan head.  Sweet Belgian malty aroma with candi sugar and dry bourbon oak cherries.  Nice, sweet full malty body with great tart fruity oaky balance.  Hides its alcohol wonderfully through a dry, semi-tart finish.

2350,"2005-02-01",3.0,"UPDATED: MAR 2, 2006 Original Rating (6-2-6-2-12=2.8): Rum-like boozy alcohol and hazelnuts overwhelm the aroma with some oakiness and sweetness.  Dark mahogany brown with thin but lasting ring of tan head.  Hazelnut and rum also in the flavour with strong sticky sweetness.  Smooth with medium body but low carbonation leaves this one feeling very still and lazy in the mouth and the texture is not enough to make it enjoyable.  Sampled at the Extreme Beer Festival 2005.Rerate (7-3-6-4-12=3.2): Charred wood is strong in the aroma with strong, sour cherries and definite alcohol apparent.  Opaque dark brown body is topped by a low but lasting off white head.  Strong barrel-aged flavour has blended somewhat with malt sweetness and strong fruitiness.  Raisins, dates, figs and plums are still overwhelmed by the barrel.  I think this just spent too long in the wood and isnt going to mellow.

Woody bourbon brings undesirable alcohol in while the yeast just seems to shyly be there, not really providing anything to counter this oily nut juice nature.

2350,"2005-01-31",2.6,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2005 XBF05.  The beer I was most excited to try at the fest, and probably the most disappointing.  I even went back for a second sample, hoping that something had gone wrong with the first, but alas, not so.  Appearance is a dark brown/black body, light amount of sediment, but otherwise quite clear, with large bubbles and a light beige head, foamy and prone to clumping.  Aroma has notes of cola and spiced rum, not unlike a Rum and Coke, with some dry yeast tones and an almost peanut brittle-like smell.  Only a faint hint of esters I would expect from a Belgian Dark Strong, no doubt covered up by the toasted oak aging.  Flavor closely approximates the aroma, with notes of cola (lots of residual sweetness, dark candi sugar traces), some bubble gum and a strange flavor of light ash, or dry papery malt.  Confusing.  The body, is, perhaps, the worst part of it all, with an out of place carbonation that breaks up any semblance of a smooth rich palate, that I would desire.  On top of the carbonation, it is very watery, and the flavor leaves quickly on the finish.  Lightly astringent notes, with some faintly dry/sour oak and more sugar round out the finish.From the bottle, Feb 2005, sampled 9/24/2005.  Hmm, was hoping this would be quite different in bottles, but I cant say I enjoyed it anymore than on draught.  What it did have was a better body, not nearly as watery/flat, which I expected.  Though, it still was nothing to write home about, body wise.  And the flavor, yuck, I barely had a few sips before deciding to leave the rest of the bottle for someone else to deal with.  Obnoxious sourness from the oak, acidic and just dominant.  Not at all what I look for in a Belgian ale.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2350,"2005-01-30",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2006 The Lure:A lofty head sits over darkened ruby. Fresh at the Extreme Beer Festival 2005, the syrupy sweetness of hazelnut and brown rum was all that was apparent, alcohol and sweetness being the only perceivable dimensions. A year-old bottle now also shows rich berries and obvious oak-barreling in a complex aroma. Definitely better after gaining some wisdom.

The Festivities:Prunes, raisins, dates and cherries enliven the lean malt body. A mighty oak barrel and alcohol kick shouts within the palate, as an appropriate carbonation, spaced but active, supports all flavors. Black pepper within the fruity sweetness pleases in the long run. Another very potent strong ale from Allagash.

Transcendence:
A long journey requires patience, but will have its rewards.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
