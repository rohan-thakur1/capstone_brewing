Pours darker than expected, a nearly opaque coppery red that when poured into a pitcher (as my neighbors were doing) yields a really thick foamy head with luscious lacing. That way, it looks much more like an ESB than anything else! In the tulip glass, it only has a small tight cap. I wonder if a different glass is warranted. Im thinking mason jar. Anyway, the aroma is of cherry skins, dry fruit. Sophisticated brew, totally true to style and better than many French ones Ive had, by far. The flavors are smooth and balanced with toasted white bread, dark crouton, Melba toast, and dark-skinned fruit. Apple skins. Its also nicely hopped, with a clean crisp finish.

As it warms you discover numbing cloves, cinnamon, dates, torched red apples. Very malt and fruit driven. Dry body with no sticky sweetness.

T: Some nice roasted malts up front with some dark fruits accompanying them, as it warms i pick up the pepper and spice. Serious plum flavors. Finish is what I expected with a biere de garde, a little light but very nice.

M: Very carbonated but not in a bad way. medium bodied. rather crisp.

2047,"2010-08-22",3.5,"A: The pour is a heavily orange tinted amber color, perhaps we could call it copper, with a creamy off-white head.

S: The nose is full of yeasty esters. Lots of banana, apple, and pears. A slight spice component is there as well, which goes nicely with the sweet and bready malt.

T: Quite a sweet beer, but most Belgian styles are. Lots of caramel, brown sugar, bananas, cinnamon, and nutmeg. The bread flavor is a bit more in the background and allows the other flavors to shine.

M: The body is medium with a middle of the road carbonation.

D: Im not always the biggest fan of Biere de Garde (some just seem to be very poorly done), but like most other Russian River beers, I liked this. Nice flavors and yeast notes, solid all around.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2047,"2010-08-10",3.5,"Had on tap at RR brewpub.  Not quite sure what a ""Biere de Sonoma"" was, but the waiter explained it as just a local brew, of Belgian style.  So yeah, a Belgian Ale (wrote Golden Ale in my notes).  Pours a nice hazy amber color with good carbonation.  Aroma is mostly malts, spice, and fruit.  Taste was again mostly malts with a hit of alcohol in the middle.  Finishes slightly bitter with a finish that didnt linger too long.  Solid, but not my favorite.","Orange, California, USA","Blake"

2047,"2010-06-28",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Crunchy cereals, mild herbal hops and timid esters coexist peacefully in this friendly Belgian-style Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy sheet of foam decorates the hazy burnt amber. 
-Vinnies beers seem to always brilliantly showcase the base cereals used in the aroma; this one is no exception.
-There are lots of subtleties to be tasted yet nothing stands out much or is memorable. 
-Fruity esters are relatively tame for a Belgian Ale, which in this case tends to increase drinkability. 
-The mouthfeel is quite crisp even though the malts are prominent throughout.

This was one of the more unusual ones because its aroma and appearance tricked me into thinking it would taste a certain way.

2047,"2010-04-06",4.0,"Perdition is a good looking dark golden Belgian with a foamy head. The beer smells earthy and a bit yeasty. Its a pleasant Belgian aroma.

2047,"2010-03-16",3.3,"On tap at Russian River. Shit, I have tried so many of their beers on tap in one day (from a notepad). Nice fluffy head sitting on top of a darker coppery brown colored body. Head fades away slowly. Slight haze and translucent appearance. Seems like my nose is picking up some spicy aroma. Belgian yeast aroma is coming through. There is also a sweet sugar aroma being sniffed as well. This beer is quite refreshing and not as thick as other Belgian Ales tend to be. The sugar and yeast-like flavors dominate. Nothing is really popping out at me. Honestly, from one Belgian Ale to the next, I am not getting huge differences i.e. going from Redemption to this doesnt really seem to be a big jump. I will say Redemption was more assertive, aggressive, bold, or what have you. This one is a little boring in my opinion, seeing that nothing really jumps out at me and makes me say ""Wow!"".

It poured a very nice deep copper color with a two finger width tan head that stuck around for a while and left nice lacing on the glass.

2047,"2009-05-14",3.8,"750mL bottle shared by Georgiabeer at the Brick Store.

Pours a dark hazy amber with a solid head that dissipates to a soapy cap and leaves great lacing.

The aroma is a combination of earthy aromas with a hint of funk and some sweet light fruits.  The earthy aromas come in the form of oak tannins, spicy belgian yeast and some toasted malts.  The fruits are pears, apples and may some darker fruits like raisins.  Interesting combination in the nose.

The taste has the backbone of the Belgian yeast, which leaves a slightly spicy finish, and toasted malts, which lend to a slightly dry finish.  These are supplemented by pears and apples and even some earthy hops, though theyre almost faded at this point.

The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with good carbonation.

Lovely beer.  Being the third or fourth time Ive had this beer, it was about time for me to actually review it!  

This gorgeous beer adorns the glass with some of the best lacing I have ever seen.  The mouthfeel is delicate and smooth as silk.  Notes of raisins and figs mingle with a delightful, soft funk in the nose.  These flavors carry over into the taste along with a balanced spiciness.

2047,"2009-02-26",4.1,"750ml batch 002 courtesy of KingG, thanks! My bottle was listed as 6.6% ABV on the label This is already a year or so old (according to the RR bottle log) so this should give me a good idea of whether or not to age my other bottle (batch 003). nice, ruby-red and brown mixture with a nice ring of bubbles and a thin white film. It looks good. the first whiff is a metallic, earthy smell that I also picked up from Redemption. Just like Redemption the mineral aroma fades as it warms and leaves behind a very fruity juiciness. It almost like cutting open a lemon or watermelon but not exactly. The funny thing is that while it is not a strong aroma it begs you to take one whiff after another, very cool. The flavor is bready, malty, spicy, some hops I think and maybe citrus. The thing I like about this beer is that the aroma and flavor are very good yet very subtle. It really begs you to think about what you are drinking. There is also an odd flavor that makes me think of authentic Belgians as opposed to craft Belgian-style beers. Maybe it is RRs yeast because Redemption gave me the same feeling. In any case, definitely let this warm up and you will be rewarded.

These malts have depth!  Toasted grains so robust it is as if they were smoked, not just cooked...fruity malt so ripe it is thick and juicy with a hint of tartness.  Dark tannins and lemon pepper tingle the tongue.  Palate is a touch gritty, not quite as smooth as before.

How: Bottle 750ml, consumed when probably around 4 months old.  Sent my way vy WeeHeavySD, thanks a lot Jon.
The look: Cloudy amber body topped by a small beige head
In long: Nose is intriguing, I could smell peat, lots of grass, strong spicy notes and that always pleasant wild yeast with its farmhouse hints.  Like the nose, taste was also pretty much all over the place.  Dry wood, roasted nuts, tree roots, toasted bread, dry wood, peat and green grass, pepper and other spices.  Overall the beer is pretty dry.  Short but very sharp and biting bitterness.  Did I notice an alcohol bite in a 6% beer?!?  I dont know whether or not the beer is actually spiced but I thought it was too spicy too strong for its own good.  The beer is more all over the place than complex per say yet its definitely something Id like to have more often if it was available in my area.  Ha Russian River craftbeers!

2047,"2008-08-07",3.9,"Batch 003.  Pours a dark, hazy, copper brown color with burnt sienna hues.   A huge, frothy, khaki colored head displays excellent retention, sticking around until the very last sip and leaving jagged flares and patches of fine lace on the glass.  The aroma shows malty notes of hazelnut, caramel, chocolate cake, and toasted biscuit.  Floral and citrus hop notes lend fruity bitterness, while a dry, musty yeast and hints of creamy lactose tie everything together.  Flavors start out quite roasty, transitioning to notes of walnuts, dry cocoa, earthy hops, and citrus rinds.  Dry yeast and a heaping dose of oaky vanilla complete the experience.  Medium-full bodied and incredibly smooth, the carbonation is lively but ultra-fine in texture.  Finishes dry, as do all Russian River beers.  This is an excellent brew that defies a singular classification.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

It distinctly smells and tastes strongly of fresh unfermented wort.  Not in overwhelming sweetness but the fresh malts and grassy fresh fresh hops.

2047,"2008-05-06",4.1,"From a typical Russian River c&c bottle I picked up last month at the Brewpub in Santa Rosa I decided to drink  this now after reading some forum posts on corked bottles going bad.    No problem with this one...it opened with a satisfying pop, and vapors came out of the bottle like it was dry ice.  The pour was a simply gorgeous copper, and though I decanted this carefully chunks of yeast were floating in the glass.   Great foamy white head and sticky lacing.  Again, like many RR brews the nose of this was remarkable in its complexity.   With a malt background, there was citrus, fruit, and spices that set my nose a tingle.     Mouthfeel was smooth and while not remarkable was easy on the tongue.  Flavors sort of followed the aroma but were much more intense.with the spices now more obvious.  Hops in the finish, and when you are done, you wish you had another dozen of these on the shelf.  Another fantastic beer by Russian River and it shows you dont have to have a high ABV level to make a great beer..  Finally, after making this rating I went and looked at what others had to say.

2047,"2008-05-05",2.9,"A tough one for me to rate because Im not really sure what a Belgian pale ale should taste like.  It wasnt my favourite pale ale by far, but it is different enough to stand out from its brethren.  On the other hand, it isnt a great Belgian ale either.  Orange/red in color, thought it might be an amber ale.  The flavour is somewhat hoppy, but smooth.  I found this one to be the thinest in terms of palate flavour of the beers they had on tap.","State College, Pennsylvania, USA","can8ianben"

As you put your nose to it you can smell the hops and some light fruits. There is a rather thin head with some laceing along the sides of the glass. The initial flavor has some nice bitter pine hops with some sweet pear with a bitter finish. The pear coats the sides of your mouth and leaves that pine resin long after you have finished  the beer.

2047,"2008-04-21",4.1,"Batch 003: Bronzed orange in color. Thick, extremely tight off-white foam adorns the glass with abundant lace. Sherbet, pear, earthy Vienna malt (tree bark, bread crust) and candied pecan aromas blend harmoniously with perfumey and herbal esters. Hint of butter toffee and zingy aniseed-tinged hops. Dense, pillow-soft carbonation gently expands on the palate. Earthy malts sparkle as they inundate the palate with a toffeelike richness and caramelized nuttiness. Extravagantly lush and well-textured, yet equally snappy. Jammy strawberry and juicy rum-drenched plummy esters explode at the center and embrace the malts. Delicate, well-rounded acidity adds lift and drinkability. Peppery hop bitterness quietly emerges to complement the impeccable attenuation and squeaky cleanness of the beer while seamlessly gelling with the complex yet understated sweetness. Hints of black licorice, tar and shoe polish impart more uniqueness of character to the bitterly earthy malt. Dusty yeast adds an element of rusticity while enhancing and highlighting the complex malt frame. Extremely dense in flavor despite the array of subtleties. Earthy malt finish lends a mild caramelized sweetness to the mildly grassy bitterness and lingering aniseed hop accents. Once again, Vinnie, the master brewer of subtlety and balanced, has coaxed the most out of his yeast in this work of art.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

The aroma on this is pretty good too - very bready. The cons: this tastes pretty similar to Damnation, or any of the other RR Belgians (other than the Sours) it has that mild but annoying bitterness that hits the back of the throat. Dont get me wrong, I love bitter. But thats when its an IPA giving me a full bodied bitterness. This is a single, sliver like bitterness that makes you feel like you chewed an asprin 10 minutes ago. Its an OK beer, nothing to seriously crow about. SECOND ANALYSIS: Its not that bad, and I bumped it up a notch. Still has that asprin aftertaste, but after this mellows a little it has a great, bread flavor that I like.","San Ramon, California, USA","Taverner"

Pours clear, dark copper, with a three-story head of off-white denseness.
Several minutes and sips go by before the whipped froth retreats to a skim coat, leaving a spectical of ripped curtains and rings. Classic.
Aromatics are a light mix of dry malt, cocoa dust, orange zest, a smidge of barn-door funk, and gypsum. A small amount of burnt rubber follows through..Styrian goldings no doubt.
The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium and somewhat creamy. Crisp and bone dry.

Thanks to miketd for sharing this at a recent get together.  I was expecting the typical sourness you get with a Russian River beer but this had none of those characteristics.  Instead it was a solid well made Belgian ale.  If you find yourself at the brewery perhaps this would be a good way to break the brett routine.
Aroma / Appearance - A bubbly half finger head danced to the top of the rusty brown body.  The liquid swirled fluidly around the glass.  Wheat, honey and molasses combine in a sweet melody of fruitiness.
Flavor / Palate - The dryness was typical of most Russian River beers though not as harsh.  Graham crackers, hoppiness and a late tartness form an enjoyable experience that is almost sessionable.  The only thing holding me back might be that after a while the 6% ABV would get to you.  Still it would not be tough to finish off a bottle solo.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Cranberry and lighter fruit overtones.  Flavor is light, and subtley nuanced with hints of apple, pineapple, and green spice, while what lies beneath is a simple, dry leafy body.  Not fantastically complex, but it has a great earthy yeast presence and a pure vegetal matte-like bitterness that surrounds and sustains what initially masquerades as a brittle body of flavor.

Deep red tinged amber color with a frothy white head that laced a very little. Medium bodied with frothy/creamy carbonation. The flavor is yeast, roast malt (sort of dark bread), and some lighter fruits with some bitterness. The fruit could be pear. The malt is a bit harsh. The bitter seems to come from floral hop. The finish is definitely on the dry side, there is something of a fruit skin impression, and the end is bitter, perhaps with a light touch of wood.

A very soft and soothing nose. The flavor is mildly sweet, with hints of spice that are wrapped tightly by sugar and yeast. Slight hints of pepper and honey pass by. A spicy addition of rye creeps in late. Bitterness is just evident enough to offset the limit of sweetness and keeps everything sedated. The finish is soft, long and yeasty, mild fruitiness lingering. Mouthfeel is light-medium, busily carbonated, soft like peach fuzz and a real pleasure to take big gulps of.

2047,"2007-06-26",4.1,"750mL bottle graciously traded to me by footy.  Shared with a friend on 5/26/07Beautiful appearance.  Big, rocky white head is well-retained and laces immensely.  Unfiltered but still bright with a peachy-copper body filled with tiny bubbles.Dry and yet full of satisfying malt character, it has an almost hay-like rustic character that is aided by soft Belgian esters and light white pepper phenols.  Lemon and light cake-icing-like sweetness gives a slight roundness to the aroma and there is a touch of graininess and minerals on the finish.  Medium-high strength of aroma with no flaws whatsoever, and no alcohol perceived.Both nutty and chewy come to mind when describing the flavor/texture.  Certainly more light white pepper phenols are present, as well as very minimal esters (light nectarine and strawberry).  Sweetness adds some depth but is fully removed from the finish, thanks to a crisp, rustic, pale malt character that leaves light streaks of honey on the palate.  Id love to know the grain bill of this one, its so unusual and not your typical full-of-honey character blonde, Belgian ale (not that theres anything wrong with those).  Could be the time spent in the bottle has attenuated most of the sugars, but the dry malt character it has left behind is in a world of its own.  Incredibly drinkable, with nothing particularly challenging.  Just fresh, crisp and enjoyable.  Along similar lines to Redemption (non-brett version) in that the malt flavor really shines through and the clean, elegant yeast supports the flavor without going overboard on ester/phenol character.  As usual, the mouthfeel/carbonation is perfectly tight and engaging, leaving no wateriness/thinning on the palate.  Flawless. Fantastic.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2047,"2007-06-20",3.1,"On tap at the brewpub.  Pours a cinnimonny copper brown color with a thin layer of wispy off-white head.  Aroma is a mild, but pleasant concoction of toasted nuts and baked french bread crust.  A hint of estery pear skins wafts gently, but the spiciness is restrained.  Notes of brown sugar and caramel come to mind, but its nutty and dry and undeserving of any unneccesary sweet descriptors.  Light bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel.  This was described to me as a funky brown ale, and I fail to see a better way to describe this beer.  Lightly toasted, bready malts join brazil nut husks at the front of the palate, and this slowly transistions to a mild yeasty fruitiness.  Its not really sour or funky, but more like the creamy lining if a camembert cheese with a splash of pear juice.  Its almost like the finish cant decide whether to be fruity or cheesy, leaving it mildly rubbery.  After the first few sips, my attention is peaked, but the remaining sips leave me wanting some acidity to cleanse the palate of this cheesy nuttiness or to simply stick with the nuttiness and be done with the flavor profile.  The start of the palate, while straightforward, is a clean classic nutty brown, but the yeasty character seems to muddy my palate more than enhance or support the flavors.  Highly interesting, unique, and un-like anything else however, so a worthwhile try.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

This beer sits in the tulip glass with a brilliantly clear, lightly burnt, reddish amber color (it is a bit dark for something associated with Pale Ale, but certainly no darker than many American Style Pale ales).  The head starts out a good finger in height, and has an amber tinged, tan color to it and it lingers on for quite some time (a solid visual presentation from the tap).  The aroma is a nice mix of spice and fruit character and this is certainly an enjoyable brew to linger over the nose for a while.  I get aromatic notes of prunes, cloves and raisins.

The taste is quite nicely integrated.  It is a mix of spicy hops, earthy-spice driven fermentation character as well as a nice fruitiness from both malt and fermentation.  I get flavors of caramelized apples, pears and a touch of raisins.  It is actually quite fruity at times as this is the most noticeable flavor contributor.  The finish is dominated by an earthy spiciness that is reminiscent of an almost peaty-coriander character with a touch of clove.  This is not really sweet, yet still manages to evoke an concentrated fruit character of figs, raisins, prunes and perhaps even some cherry notes.  When coupled with a goat cheese gratinee, the beer actually picks up a bit of sweetness, which accentuates a still bright, yet sweeter fruitiness.

This is really the quintessential quaffing brew.  I am really enjoying my glass of this brew and I am wishing that I had easy access to this on a regular basis.  The stand out for me is how well integrated and layered the flavors are here; nothing screams at you here, but still it is a very interesting brew without taking away from this being such an easy drinking beer fit for a happy afternoon session among friends.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Beer poured brilliantly into my giant snifter glass, with a chestnut colored body and a tall ivory head. The aroma was earthy and organic. Thoughts of peat, toasted wheat bread, with hints of coco, black pepper corns, and leather. The flavor brought out some nutty characters and a hint of brett on the finish gave a deep underling tang to the brew.

Its got a Belgian character and a complexity but in this instance it perhaps just doesnt vibe with me.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
2047,"2006-02-08",2.9,"Tap @ Barclays. Reminded me of a pale ale. I wouldnt have guessed it was brewed in a Belgian style. I sensed a slight hint (very slight) of spice, not too much hops...it was fairly mild. Ill have to retaste it, but it definately was more akin to a pale.","anywhere usa, ","mrnutsnbolts"

2047,"2005-10-09",3.0,"The aroma had dark fruit (raisins/plums), slight citrus, flowers, and a light caramel sweetness, but the aroma was thin.  The beer poured a golden orange color w/ brownish hues; no head and lacing.  The flavor had fermented dark fruit, slight citrus, flowers and slight caramel notes.  The mouthfeel was light and carbonated.","San Diego, California, USA","Hairofthedog"
2047,"2005-07-27",3.5,"Excellent appearance... rich amber-copper color, nice head that retained its size very well.  A cross between a pale ale and a Biere de Garde.  Russian River now calls it a ""Biere de Sonoma"" variety.  Delicious malty flavor that is balanced exceptionally well with the hops.","Orange, California, USA","Heatwaves"
2047,"2005-06-04",1.8,"on tap at Hollingshead Deli, Orange CA
This was disappointing, copper color, nice looking pour, but a flavor that was mainly butterscotch","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
2047,"2005-06-03",3.5,"A very perfumesque tastre and aroma.  Supposedly a Biere De Garde according to the chalkboard at the brewery. Body is fluffy and pleasant.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Enniskillen"
2047,"2005-05-04",3.2,"Brick red brew with a huge loosely packed head. A bit too fizzy for me, but still an enjoyable brew. Biscuity malt dominates with some spiciness coming through. Yeast seems to overwhelm the hop presence in the finish.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
2047,"2004-12-11",3.6,"Draft. Rich amber color and a nice off-white head. Malty aroma with some banana and clove esters. Malt and spice flavor with some stone fruit. Smooth and easy to drink. Very well put together for drinkability - nothing harsh or off at all, just very smooth. Could just use a bit of complexity to move it up.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
2047,"2004-11-16",3.6,"Clear copper body topped by white head.  Aroma is medium sweet, candi sugar, spice, light herbal.  Taste is medium sweet, some candi sugar, herbal, medium bitterness.  Medium body.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2047,"2004-07-20",3.2,"A very spicy, yeasty beer.  Flavor just seems to ooze out of this one.  Too bad its slightly a one-dimensional flavor of strong spice with a tinge of fruit.  Tasty and something my girlfriend would love.  Solid but not great.","Valley Center, California, USA","SG"
2047,"2004-07-19",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 30, 2008 I love my first rating from July 2004: ""Medium orange hue.  Strong wheat, orange and rye in this one.  very pleasent.""  I wasnt very wordy, this was after an entire day of drinking around San Francisco, and I began a second session that night at Russian River.   But I got to try this again (aged 2005 keg) on Jan 31, 2008 at the Brickskellar.  It was dark rusty orange/brown, the color of dark bread crust.  Had a smell and flavor that I liken to black pepper, oranges, milder levels of coriander and a bready, buttered biscuit flavor.  Perhaps a little past its prime, but still delicious.


Rerate: sample from a 750ml bottle, batch 003.  Some sort of creamy/fatty salami meat, the herbage is somewhat heavy.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
2047,"2004-06-17",2.9,"Slight yeast, barnyard, mildew, malt, and a touch of spice in the nose.  Red/Amber color with a thin fine head.  Not much appears to be going on, vaguely Belgian with a fair amount of crystal malt and some earthy hops.  Almost cherry tartness surfaces now and again wit touches of caramel.  Nutty hops in the finish.  decidedly smuh.","Yokosuka, JAPAN","Marc"
2047,"2004-06-14",4.1,"Draught @ OBriens San Diego
The beer pours golden amber with a semi-creamy white head that is moderate in size, a nice sheet of concealing lace seals off the glass. Nose is sweet malt, crisp and a bit spicy, nice yeast presence and the start continues the sweet malt with the top being a bit more than moderate in its feel to the palate. Pertinent acidity, the hops masterful in their spiciness, dry aftertaste, a real treat and a great example of the brewers art.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
2047,"2004-06-08",3.2,"(Draft: OBriens in San Diego, CA) This is like a pale ale with a modest Belgian influence; Lightly sweet and malty, but the moderately bitter hoppiness is the dominant flavor; Not much spice, but some clove toward the finish; Not much aroma; A ruddy light brown color is pretty, but the light tan head fades fast, leaving only small traces of lacing","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
2047,"2004-06-07",3.4,"A very nice pale belgian ale that pours golden in color with a small white head.  Aromas of spice and a little doughiness and flavors of the same. Probably the hoppiest begian ale that Ive had... nothing special, but a good start on an under-explored  style.","San Diego, California, USA","Sickboy282"
2047,"2004-06-07",3.6,"This beer pours with a slightly cloudy, deep amber body topped by a medium thick, white head with some lacing.
