Draught @ St. Urhon Sahtipäivät 2014
Aroma has licorice, some strong bready tones and some hay. Perhaps some smoky tones too. Flavour has licorice, some spicy tones and ripe bananas. Also alcohol is present in the background, but it does not disturb. Not the most typical sahti at all its breadiness. Not bad anyway.

Coffee version

Very vegetal. Dodgy, to be honest. Maybe onion and chicory. Not a good sahti, probably not as the brewer intended.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

Sweet sahti malt in the nose, with a touch of junipery sourness. Lots of salty licorice and anise in the flavor - not suiting the style, but tasting damn good. Quite thick and full-bodied with no CO2. Not very sahti-like, but pretty nice.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"
