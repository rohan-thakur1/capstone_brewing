2360,"2017-06-22",3.7,"Pours light amber with abundant and foamy head. Refuses to come down, quite luscious. Aroma hoppy, not only grass and herbal notes but also something really dank and slightly funky. Getting lots of hop oils, almost hop extract levels. Taste reveals also light and well hopped body, nice bitterness that is dominating but in a nice and enjoyable way. Malty body is still somewhat recognisable but giving way to hops that jump forward and define this beer. Overall, nice and drinkable, I would say feels more like an IPA than an amber.","ESTONIA","jinroh"

2360,"2017-05-31",3.8,"1 pint can. From the blurb on the can, it appears that this brew is aggressively hopped, like a pale ale or an IPA, over a amber ale malt base. Appearance-wise, this amber ale pours an almost-clear deep amber shade, with a good head of froth, which manages to persist for a while before receding a a thin ring. Aroma-wise, hops are forward and everywhere! Floral and citrus notes dominate, but more of the pine and resin in particular, with almost undetectable doughy, biscuity malt notes. Taste-wise, again it is dank, following the hops, mainly piney, grassy and resin flavours with a little but of fruitiness, above a light wheat malt backbone, and a bitter finish. Palate-wise, it has a nice, average level of carbonation, a somewhat medium-to-light body. Somehow, the focus on the hops makes the amber ale character less prominent, as does the lightening of the malt base, so it does not feel quite like a weightier amber ale.","","the_beergery"
2360,"2017-05-27",3.8,"Can at the Fountain and Ink in London. Really big hops for an amber, balanced with a little malt and some summer fruits. Long bitter finish. Really good beer.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","kwik-lime"

With Nelson Sauvin and Mosaic hops, this combines two of my favourite hops. On the other hand, the combination of dank sticky icky and white wine seems like a bit of a culture clash - or, at least, not the kind of parties I get invited to. Shut up! I get invited to parties! Ill have you know, the last party I went to, we partied like it was 1999! ...because it was... My social graces - or lack thereof - aside, this might well be the best Amber Ive ever had - because its not really an Amber, its a DIPA in all but name. Big bombastic fun, well into legendary status. (18/20)

http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/modern-times apariencia de esta cerveza es llamativa con una corona de espuma amplia y blanquecina, de perlas compactas y medias que aparentan porosidad, buena retención en la vida de la cerveza, la tonalidad del liquido es un ámbar intenso con destellos rojizos, turbiedad presente que puede ser por dos razones, que la cerveza no este filtrada o por el dry hopping, el las paredes del vaso se avecina un cuerpo mediano, ligera actividad de carbonatación.
Los aromas son potentes y destacan de primera instancia el lúpulo, las típicas características americanas se liberan como toronja, piña, durazno y mango, hay presencia de dulzor como caramelo, las maltas apenas se perciben dando ligero toque a pan.
El sabor realmente esta perfecto en cuanto el standar, aunque es una cerveza con 85 unidades de amargor esta bien cimentada, la base de las maltas aportando dulzor necesario para equilibrar, los lúpulos dan características frutales y cítricas, puedo identificar toronja, mango, durazno, piña, toronja, cascara de naranja, muy tropical para una cerveza ambarina, la malta aporta toques a caramelo y corteza de pan o galletas, sabor interesante y concentrado pero bien balanceado, ligero picor al final del trago y amargor consistente que la vuelven seca, me gusto bastante en general en vista, aroma y sabor se plantea solida.","MEXICO","Yased"

2360,"2016-01-16",3.8,"Draught at the Kerho, Tampere, Finland.
Cloudy golden color with a small white head.
Citrusy and sourish hops, mild bitterness and some fruitiness in the aroma. 
The flavor is citrusy and fruity hops, tropical fruits, mild sourness, mild bitterness and dryish malt. Both drinkability and likability are very high. This goes very well with the System of a Down coming from the bar sound system. Enjoyable.

Rich world class nose of dank and sweet tropical (pineapple) hops coupled with a bit of pine and spicy spruce over toasted biscuit plus a caramel note. As it warms orange rind is noted.

Solid medium body that has creamy aspects and a bit of resinous oily slickness. Nearly world class carbonation with a strong effervescent middle and a prickly burst in the finish.

The flavor profile is outstanding and strikes a good balance between hop flavor and bitterness. It begins with a semi-sweet tropical influence that flows to dank in the middle, then pine/spruce towards the finish. Underneath is a toasted biscuit that flows to caramel as the finish approaches and delivers the strongest sweet note - noticeable, but not dominant.

Theres tangy tangerine on the bitterness profile and a lengthy finish as there is plenty of hoppy loveliness to carry the flavour along.

Lemongrass and citrus fruit flavors ride subtle cereals to an elegant resinous hop finish, building yet another beautiful Modern Times quencher.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A healthy head of foam covers the golden-hued amber.
-The amber color strangely translates to only very light toasted and caramel malt flavors.
-This would be wonderful on the hand pull.
-The flavor profile is balanced.

2360,"2014-12-09",4.0,"I poured this into a pokal from a pint can and considered how terribly light-bodied it seemed. Obviously a bit of a paradox! The liquid is ruby-amber and crystal clear, capped with a white sea-foam; rocky and soft, all at once. The lacing is light on the glass, delicate and sticky.

Grapefruit and passion fruit take the point, but the aroma is outrageously dank with hops; it comes across more of a DIPA than an Amber, but with a caramel malt rich enough to temper the idea. Still, if I was nose first into a hops cone, I couldnt get too much more resin than Im finding here. (sigh-love)

The body median, this brew still flows nicely, balanced and flavorful. The carbonation ""fair to middlin"" is popping lightly over my tongue and cheeks, adding to the dryness that keeps me tipping the glass. The finish is short, slightly bitter and very, very comfortable.

2360,"2014-09-09",3.5,"16oz can acquired via trade. Thanks! Glad to finally try the hoppy ones. Pours a darker well hazed amber hue, subtle winter sunset orange, depth and firm haze darken this significantly. Rust and copper body with a small cakey offwhite head atop. Decent layer with ok stick around and lacing overall. Aromas are a bit citric, earthy with some gentle tropical fruit, white grape. Bready malts, floral, a bit of biscuit and carmelized essence. Touches of earth, grainy and biscuity with decent hop character. Initial is lighter end of medium bodied, distinct strike of Mosaic is fruity and tropical, gentle pizza spice, florals and mellow citrus. Some decent bitterness but a bit more fruity and sweet. Touches of biscuit and carmelized elements poke through a bit. Some gentle sweetness into the middle, earth and citric bitterness, florals. Gentle fruit character still presses on, tropical and a bit sweet. Backend is a bit more earthy and bitter, rind and floral bitterness hit a bit more and cut through that sweeter malt base here which isnt overwhelming and plays well with the fruity hops that still lead the charge. But it is definitely noticeable. Finish is a bit earthy, bitter, that lingering weird pizza spice, tropical fruit essence I get sometimes. While the base is a bit sweeter than the last rate, this one offers a more intriguing hop profile for me at times. And I think Fortunate is ultimately more drinkable, but this one more complex. Still, overall I do find it a bit underwhelming compared to reviews. Perhaps getting to Cali and retrying these there should be a priority. Otherwise, this is a nice beer that offers good flavors, some trendy hop character in more conservative tones albeit, and some good flow (and countering sweetness).","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Pours a pretty muddy looking amber... light tan head.. good retention and lacing.

Nose has plenty of sticky piney hops, but a resolute malt profile brings dry toast, caramel and IMO, a pretty big hit of diacetyl... 

Flavor begins with a good bitter bite and then moves immediately into pithy grapefruit/big pine... malts take over and provide a lingering toasted bread playground for the hops that go on and on.. With warmth a little buttery note is magnified by the residual sweetness... but also a tropical fruity hoppiness emerges as well..

American amber ale
6.8% ABV
85 IBU

APPEARANCE: Poured a hazy, ugly, penny copper orange with a lazy sticky two finger off white head. Stuck around for a nice while before finally settling into a small halo. 

AROMA: If dank was a fruit, then this would be fresh squeezed dank! Great tropical fruit overload, pineapple, mango, and citrus. The simcoe hops really hit the nose before making way for the malty goodness that crashes over. 

TASTE: The aroma makes you think you are drinking an ipa, but the first sip is malt forward and reminds you that this is still an amber ale. Flavor is intense and in your face. Great fruitiness and floral notes that are interviewed with a small amount of pine. Finishes out with a nice sweet biscuity, honey backbone. 

MOUTHFEEL: Medium body and Medium carbonation. Slightly more sticky and chewy then I would expect from 6.8% ABV. Nice semi dry snappy finish that quenches me thirst but also leave me longing for a other sip at the same time. 

OVERALL: I'll go right out and say this is my favorite amber to date. So well balanced, but the hoppiness that isn't usually found in an amber is nice and present. Makes it drink like an American amber ipa combo and I love it! Great job Modern Times, I now put this above the fortunate islands on my top Modern Times beer list!

Beer number three was just as excellent as the prior samples. A full bodied amber ale is a typical West Coast hop driven release with an attitude. I wish I would have been able to drink a whole pint that night.

Aroma / Appearance - A coppery gold semitransparent base has wisps of ivory head. Lemons, malt, and crisp fresh hops blast the senses with a full flavored profile. There are no pretenses here of subtlety; this is a West Coast beer at its finest.

Flavor / Palate - Lemons, honey, and almonds sooth the tip of the tongue. Roses drizzled over a layer of waffle dough carry into the back of the throat. At that point the hops explode like a burst of fireworks. Well balanced with lots of depth, the entire experience is memorable.

A medium bodied amber. The malts are fruity and sweet. The hops are citrusy and grapefruity. Decent carbonation. Interesting..this beer is either a hoppy amber or a malty IPA, or somewhere in between. Perhaps the Hoppy-dank amber should have tipped me off? Anyway a very nice beer. Its way hop heavy but there are a lot of malts at the finish. Definitely not your overly boring amber. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
2360,"2014-03-17",3.6,"On tap at Beachwood Seal Beach and served in a half pint as a warm-up for the bottle share. Slightly hazy orange to amber in color with a finger of khaki head that settles to a cap and leaves some patches of lace. Aroma is dank hops, grapefruit, pine, more tropical fruit, and a bit of an herbal note. The malt aroma features caramel and toasred bread. Taste is thoroughly dank and moderately bitter with the tropical fruit and caramel sweetness offering some balance early. Medium body, viscous texture, lower carbonation, and a long bitter finish.","","sitzds"
2360,"2014-03-16",4.0,"Pours a beautiful hazy orange with lacy white head that stuck to glass. Aroma isn't huge but notes of grapefruit and pine can be picked up.

Fantastic complexity of bright citrus/tropical hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish.

Wet, dank hop oils cover a grassy field of passion fruit, guava, grapefruit, & pineapple while the sky is raining toffee & caramel Bullzeye candy. The taste is a bit more malt forward with a large, sweet caramel & nutty presence... But theres still plenty of hoppage to make its way around. Tangerine, mango, passion fruit, grass, skunky musky hops. Definitely wasnt expecting this at all...
