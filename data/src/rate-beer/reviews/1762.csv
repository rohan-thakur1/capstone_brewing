1762,"2016-10-17",2.9,"Hmm I've sampled this on two separate occasions and was disappointed both times by this lager from Sierra Nevada. Appearance is a nice tarnished bronze amber with a steady crown of white foam, aroma is an ok caramel and grain with grassy hops, unusually grassy for the style. Likewise the flavor is caramel malt like a Marzen, but with an unpleasant spicy grain accent that pairs poorly with a sharp herbal/grassy hop tang in the finish, simply not that appealing IMHO. Unique but not in a way that I would want to try this again.

A Vienna style beer is a light coloured amber lager that has a delicate balance between sweet caramel malts and floral hops

Aroma: Lovely smell, I got toasted biscuit tones, sweet caramel and malts, all of which were absolutely lovely to smell, wow, really liked the aroma, good start.................

Appearance: On pour I got a clear amber looking colour, and a massive head which was very frothy, but it does settle down quick enough to peter out, no real lacing, and ok to look at

Lovely taste, really enjoyed drinking this beer, was dead smooth and easy to drink from start to finish, a type of beer to saviour long into the night, excellent.

Tasted a lot of malt, also got caramel and toffee

Really full of tastes, sweet but not too sweet, and all flavours balanced and drinkable

The taste is malt-centric, but not overwhelming, somewhat comparable to the all-malt Michelob with perhaps a slightly better profile and a little more hops (Or a much better more malty and hoppy Yuengling). Its bready like a soft pretzel or caibatta bread.  The hops are definitely there and easily distinguishable as being present, but are muted relative to Sam Adams Boston Lager, which I guessing this beer is Sierra Nevadas answer to.

1762,"2014-11-11",2.5,"UPDATED: NOV 17, 2014 12 oz bottle, poured into a nonic pint at approximately 45 degrees F.

A: Poured the color of clean synthetic motor oil, and when pooled into the glass, took on the color of the good, home-raised honey a friend of mine gets from his hives in northern Kentucky. Minimal head formed, and died quickly into a patchy cap and thick ring. Bubbles stream from the bottom of the glass like they’re white girls heading for a Starbucks that just announced Pumpkin Spice Lattes at 50% off.

S: Lightly cinnamon-sugared toast with some caramel-covered toffees on the plate.

T: The flavors open with a lightly roasted caramel toffee toast, as promised by the aroma. This is quickly subsumed by a piney-earthy hop flood with hints of citrus underlying it, which plows into the forefront with all the grace and subtlety of a tanker truck loaded with nitroglycerine slamming into three school buses full of screaming children and a gunpowder factory. That hop barrage takes over completely through the middle, and lingers long after the finish, which is a severe disappointment to this malthead.

M: Very light, but saved from feeling watery by the lively carbonation.

O: I wanted to like this beer. I really did. I love Vienna lagers, to the point that the GLBC Eliot Ness is one of my favorite beers of all time. But when you take a Vienna lager and do your utmost to transform it into an Americanized hop monster version, you lose me completely.

1762,"2014-09-12",3.6,"Good amber/vienna lagers... really thats something there isnt a whole lot of in the high quality department. Im sure theres some great European ones but that only one I really enjoy is GL Elliot Ness, the rest I find lacking. With this style balance really is key, a playful dance of toast, cereals, grass, caramel and light pine comes through here luckily. Perfect timing realy as this is what one wants when the summer nights get cooler, and nice to have another brewers take on the style that isnt thin or overtly sweet. Lightly sweet, bitter jabs with a malty dry finish.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"

A bit doughy sweet throughout.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
1762,"2014-09-11",3.8,"This was poured into a pilsener.
The appearance was a nice golden bronzed slightly amber color with a slight transparency about it. Carbonation was seen rising at a nice pace. A one finger white foamy head appears and dissipates within about a minute.
The smell had a nice roasted nuttiness about it with a smooth caramel and toffee upon it.
The taste was mainly sweet with a rolling nuttiness opening up on my taste buds. Lingering nutty to caramel aftertaste leading into a dry nutty finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a light sessionability about it. The carbonation seems good for the style and for me.
Overall, mmmm....good Vienna Lager Id have again and personally I think this would go great with pepperoni pizza.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength.

Incredibly clean in flavors as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice.

1762,"2014-08-27",4.3,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12 oz bottle into a dimpled mug. The label has a short description of the beer and it lists the abv at 5.3% abv. 
Appearance: The body has a nice orange amber color with great clarity and some visible carbonation. This is topped off with an average one finger tall head which is off white in color and settles down to a thin layer of foam. Lacing is slick and mostly just slide right down the sides of the glass as I drink. 
Smell: It has a light overall presence. What is noticeable is mostly sweet and malty. It has nice toffee and nougat like notes with just a touch of floral hop spice. 
Taste / Palate: The flavor is well balanced leaning just towards the malty sweet side. Like the aroma it has a very nice malty sweetness with light toffee and nougat like sweetness that is delicately balanced by Noble hop spice. It has a medium body and a smooth easy drinking feel. The drinkability of this beer is crazy good.","New York, USA","generallee08"

Normally I prefere ales, but Im always willing to try new brews, and occasionally I do like a lager or pilsner. Anyway, as lagers go this one was pretty good.
Aroma was almost non-detectable; very slight malt.  Poured nice dark golden color with a slight head which dissipated fairly quickly but left a nice lacing all the way through the pint. Carbonation was good  and nice medium body. The foretaste slightly toasted malt with a nice bitter finish, much as youd expect from an ale. As lagers go, this is among the better offerings out there and definitely worth the price of 2.25 a pint.","Oroville, California, USA","celogan"
