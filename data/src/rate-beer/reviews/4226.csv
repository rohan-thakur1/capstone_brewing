Pours a dark cherry with brown tones - like not a stout. Some surface light tan foam. Smells like cherries, wood, some charcoal and cola.

Medium to Full-bodied; Strong cherry flavour with a lot of sugars, a good malt backbone and a hint of oak and yeast in the back of the flavour. Aftertaste is long lasting, hitting some sour notes from the cherries, a bit of a effervsence hiding some malt, a lot of oak, bunches of sweetness and more cherries than Ive tasted in most beers! Overall, simply a great beer, but coming from the brewery, youd pretty much expect that, but this is above that, and quite simply one of the best beers Ive had recently.

4226,"2013-02-22",3.4,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2015 12oz bottle, shared by alexsdad06. Clear dark brown color, sort of a light color for a ""stout"". Bubbly off-white / khaki head. Couple dots of lace. Mostly minimal. Awesome, huge cherry aroma. From the nose and appearance I can already tell that this is definitely more fruit beer than stout. Medium body. Light carbonation. Lightly viscous, but no stickiness in the finish. Lightly tart, light oaky sweet taste. Some very light chocolate in the finish. Tasty treat that Im happy for the chance to try, but it definitely feels past its prime (brad said it was probably a couple years old). The nose held up just fine though, very great aroma. 8/3/6/3/14 Update note, 11/9/15: 12oz bottle, 2007 label, thanks to shigadeyo for sharing. Yeah, pretty much tastes just as I remember. Not changing any scores here, just checking in to say so. Touch of cheese, along with the big cherry.

4226,"2013-01-30",4.0,"12 oz. bottle, bonusd by ekoerper (thanks Ed), pours a dark reddish brown with a small beige head. Aroma screams truckloads of cherries - nothing artificial about them - smells like pure, fresh cherries, along with a touch of the oak barrels, though not very prominent. There isnt really any notice that this is a stout. Flavour brings out potent cherries upfront, atop a more recognizable (than the nose) stout background. There is a thick malt backing that gives the cherries a big body to sit on top of, making it even more complex. Oak barrels round this off beautifully, but intensifying the complexity. This is truly superb. Cherry (or any fruit) stouts have never succeeded to impress me... until now. Most excellent stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

A: Pours a clear dark cherry color with a light tan head. Some light bubbles and and small specs of lace are left on the glass.

S: Smells exactly like cherry coke. I mean exactly like it. The only difference is when I put my nose into the glass the bubbles arent hitting my nose.

T: Dark cherry with a slight sour tang to it. Mild black licorice as well. Almost candied in nature with a high sweetness to it. 

M: Pretty drinkable with a light body and smooth finish.

O: This was an odd beer. While I didnt hate I didnt particular enjoy it. It was a nice beer to try and I would recommend it for cherry candy fanatics.

4226,"2012-06-02",3.2,"So I just returned home from a quick Wisconsin beer run. First, I tried the WI Belgian Red which I enjoyed very much, but it was a bit heavy on the fruit for me. So I thought Id take a break and switch it up with a New Glarus Cherry Stout... turns out, they are oddly similar.

Pours like a lighter barleywine. More clarity than youd expect from any stout.

The nose is bossed around by the massive cherries. Faint vinegar, subtle roasted malts... a few suggestions of ""stout"" but honestly not much.

The production of this beer obviously doesnt differ much from the Belgian Red. The overpowering, tart cherry is supported by some light cocoa and toffee, barely.

It also helps to take it in small doses. Most of us wouldnt eat an entire box of chocolate covered cherries.  Doing that would be ridiculous!  Its equally ridiculous to drink more than 1 glass of unplugged cherry stout.  Its incredibly sweet, rich, and chocolatey smooth.

4226,"2012-05-27",3.9,"Appearance: Pours out a clear, dark brown body with plenty of amber-hued hints at the edges and topped with a slim, off-white head.

Smell: It really just smells more akin to a brown ale given a large, vibrant top note of Ludens Cherry throat drops.

Taste: A roundabout gulp of cherry-flavored cola with extra added toasty malt tastes. Fairly sweet throughout. Lightly tart. Theres a bit of middling woodiness from the oak, but, for the most part, the cherries take center stage. Even farther down into the cherry bin youll find some slight mustiness, but, at best, its reserved. Closes out as sweet and fruity as it kicked off.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. Lightly sticky in the mouth.

Overall: Its a very fine beer, dont get me wrong, but not a stout. Instead of ""cherry stout"" call it ""stout cherry"", because theres definitely plenty of cherriness within.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Light lace sticks. I smell cherry Jolly Ranchers, cherry juice, etc. The fruit comes full-force in the scent. Some light funkiness to it. Slightly musty. 

The mouth is creamy. Carbonation level is moderate (high for a stout, but decent for a fruit beer). Body is full, but not filling. Wonderful tart cherries all over the flavor. They start out a bit sweet, but have that faint-puckering tartness on the finish. Superb. No roasted aspects noted. I could drink this all day. Wonderful beer.

A firm ruby brown glow on the edges shines bright. A frothy tannish head atop, healthy layer with ok lacing. Sticks around ok. Aromas are rich cherries, tart but a bigger bite of sweetness. Touches of toast, roast, and mellow cocoa. Some more cherry. Firm. Initial is rich sour and tart cherries up front, lingering on, firm and strong. Middle offers touches of sweetness, biscuits and toffee. Gentle toast and roast, some cocoa and fudge. Cherries take over, Door County would be proud.

4226,"2012-02-28",3.5,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/10/2010.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

This pours very light for a stout, almost the same color as a brown ale. Hazelnut or walnut brown with tons of ruby tint. A small off-white head forms upon pouring, with just a touch of lace. Large bubbles cling to the side of the glass.

The aroma of sweet fermented cherries wafts up into my nose. Not really any noticeable malt aroma.

Sweet and sour fermented cherries really control the taste, a bit of dark malt really takes the back seat. Stays sour with some spiced oakiness giving it some additional character at the end.

This has a tart and puckering mouthfeel; medium carbonation and the body comes off as a little bit lighter than medium. Leaves the lips sticky.

The taste was not exactly what I was expecting - a lot heavier on the tart cherries and a lot lighter on the stout - but I enjoyed it. I am actually wondering how they call this a stout. It is more sour than a real stout, but once I got used to that, I would drink this again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

4226,"2012-02-27",2.9,"I expected a stout with a little sting of cherry in it. Something dark, mysterious, and big. This was thin and overpowered by the cherries. Its drinkable, but seems more of a sour brown ale than anything else. A rare miss by Dan.","Wisconsin, USA","propsync"

The nose is precisely what youd expect from a barrel aged New Glarus cherry fruit beer. At least, it was for me. Medicinal cherry notes with cherry skins, oaked notes. Probably the highlight of the brew for me - The flavor profile begins with more cherry notes, oak and earth, and pushes towards the malt side of things with chocolate and roast - with a bitterness present, along with general sweetness. Love this one, honestly","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
4226,"2012-02-25",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2012 Shared generously by daknole. Ive been wanting this one for a while and it definately wasnt a disappointment. Pour is deep mahogany with a khaki head. Aroma is sweet/tart with notes of chocolate, cherry, oak, and vanilla. Flavor shows the same with a tiny amount of roast to support the berry sweetness as well as some much needed acidity on the backend. Overall body is moderate and is balanced fairly well. This beer reminds me of the belgian red with more depth/balance and a heavier malt profile. Good stuff.

EDIT: After trying a fresh bottle im not as impressed. If the recipe is exactly the same as previous batches, im convinced that this one definately gets better with age. The older bottle I tried had much better balance and the slight medicinal quality found in the newer bottle was completely gone.","Portland, Oregon, USA","dionysus"

Pours a dark brown with a reddish hue to it as well as an off white head. Scent is a blend of barley and sweet cherries. The first part of the taste I noticed is the sweet, tart cherry flavor followed by the bolder, malted stout after taste that had hints of cocoa and coffee. Smooth and sweet to drink. A very complex fruit beer that has much more to offer than just the fruity taste.","Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA","Lemke10"

No roasted malt character to speak of, but a touch of vanilla from the oak barrels. Seriously, strong cherry aroma, bordering on cough syrup. Taste absolutely nails it, though. Again, more cherries in a big way, hint of oak. Still not a stout, but really succeeds as a stronger, slightly more tart version of NBR.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","jlruthven"
4226,"2012-02-03",4.3,"Cherry Stout pours a very dark brown.  It might look black in that glass but as you pour the brew youll notice its more of a brown color.  Very little head is poured and whatever is poured quickly dies.  No lacing is present. 

Like I said above, this is not really a stout.  Its missing a lot of the stout characteristics you usually see.  No coffee, no roasted malt, etc.  Its just straight on cherry up front.  Its a sweet aroma.  Youll also pick up the barrel characteristics  Oak and vanilla.  Its lovely and something I could just sit there and smell for hours.

Taste is just as good.  With a lot of cherry beers, you might get a medicinal or cough syrup kind of taste.  Not here, its fresh, cherries.  They start out sweet but turn tart.  I also picked up something I didnt pick up in the smell and thats some chocolate.  Chocolate covered cherries anyone? Mixed in there with the oak and vanilla and you have something you just want to drink all night.

It smells exactly like Wisconsin Belgian Red, no stout scent whatsoever. It is a nice sweet cherry pie scent with a hint of oak.

The taste brings in more stout flavors, this is chocolate covered black cherry beer. This is far from a conventional stout. It has some slight oaky notes as well. Not much tartness, mostly just sugar sweet cherries. It is almost like they just added 10% stout to a bottle of Wisconsin Belgian Red. Interesting.

I like it better than Bells take of the style. It is an immensely unique beer. It looks like a stout 100%, tastes like cherries 95%. Black cherry brew anyone?

4226,"2011-01-27",4.1,"Definite dessert beer here but I went with it for a nice cool evening after dinner drink. Reminds me a bit of a cherry cola. Lots of smooth cherry aroma that comes through pretty big in the flavor with a bit of tartness as well. Rich chocolate malts are faint in the background and round things out in a very interesting way. Cherry is still the dominant flavor but the malt adds a bit of complexity to the drink. A bit of a chalky texture on the finish, cocoa. Very interesting and unique here.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
4226,"2011-01-19",4.2,"This is uniquely not quite a stout. Id say this is more closely resembling the New Glarus Belgian Red. Lots of tart cherry flavors, but blends well with some darker malt flavors from the stout. I highly recommend this as a dessert beer.","Illinois, USA","JohnMan"
4226,"2011-01-18",3.5,"Poured into a pint glass. Thanks to alcstradamus for this.

3.5 A: Clear dark amber color. One finger of somewhat creamy off white head falls quickly, but leaves some lacing.

4.5 S: Much like the Belgian Red, this is all about the cherries. Not really anything else can come out. Though all cherries, it isnt nearly as strong as the Red, but it is still quite nice.

4.0 T: Lots of cherries like the Red, but nowhere near as strong. Unlike the Red, you get to taste some malt. Slight roastiness and a slight burntness are what I pick up the most. Weird mixture of sweet and burntness on finish. I prefer the Red by a lot, but this is pretty tasty as well.

3.5 M: Medium body. Carbonation is a little on the low side. Reasonably creamy.

3.5 D: Another well made fruit beer from NG, but a mere shadow of the Twins.

Aroma of cough syrup and sweet cherries is more dominant then I would have expected. Taste is not as overly dominated by the cough syrup notes but cherry taste is quite dominant with light tart aftertaste. Body is about average with good carbonation.

4226,"2011-01-16",3.2,"Pours an effervescent dark crimson/caramel with 2+ fingers of tan head. Average lacing & head retention

S: Heavy cherry with some woody notes

T: Cherry juice with some booze warmth & not much else up front, maybe a touch of tartness. Winish. Cherry dominates along with a touch of plum hiding on the back of the tongue. Cherry juice finish with some booze sharpness, plus some oaky notes, verging on vanilla

MF: High effervescence. Medium-light body and a watery texture

Pretty drinkable at first, but has some surprisingly rough edges that stand out as you near the end of the bottle. This beer needs food pairings, although I have no suggestion at this time. It was very fresh and different. Almost like a rough lambic.

The aroma was light roastiness, chocolate, and some cherry tartness. These carried over into the flavor to some degree, but were mainly dominated by the cherry, which also revealed some candied characteristics. There was a light silkiness to the mouthfeel, but the body was a little on the light side to me as a Stout.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

The aroma is bursting with an intense syrupy cherry character. It smells a lot like a ludens cough drop and childrens cold medicine. Whatever oak and malt notes are there are completely overpowering by the overly cloying sweet cherry presence. Im sure they used real cherries but it smells incredibly artificial.

Medium bodied with a cloyingly sweet overpowering cherry flavor. Again it is very syrupy and artificial tasting even if the cherries are real.

The aroma bares strongly the notes of artificial or preserved and sweetend cherries - just like the ones we use in our rice pudding at christmas. Besides the cherry there are some faint caramelnotes in the aroma too. The taste is odd and still it strikes me that the cherrys seems artificial and not fresh, sour and tempting. They are all sweet. Besides the markedly cherry there are strong notes of sugar candy and caramels. I dont really think that it has the body to back up the taste.

Taste is burnt toasts, maraschino cherries, wood, generic black cake, light chocolaty notes.  Finish has a surprising bitterness, similar to bitter cherries.  All in all this is more a fruit beer than a stout.  The cherries are really the dominant flavor.  Not quite as good as a Belgian Red but still pretty damn good.

4226,"2010-06-28",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2012 [Bottle] Pours brown with a small beige head. Aroma is huge on cherry and black currants, with notes of watermelon jolly rancher. The taste is cherry, then some sort of roasted malt, followed by tart cherry skins, fruit punch, cocoa and subtle notes of coffee. Unusual, but very enjoyable. Medium mouthfeel, smooth, long dry finish. Wow, another very unique and enjoyable beer from New Glarus. I could drink this one all day long. Old rating: 7/3/9/4/17=4.0New rating: A blast of cherry with some malt and light cinnamon. Taste is so unique and enjoyable. Tart cherry skins blend with cinnamon, barley, and some oak. Wow.

Maraschino, Bing, and Rainier cherry aroma burst out of the glass during the pour.  The nose on this one is definitely more Belgian Red than Road Slush stout.  Very little cocoa, coffee, caramel, or oak make their way into the aroma but it smells so damn good that I have a hard time not giving it a high score!  Not a dark or intimidating stout in any way.  Instead, this one is more ruby red/crimson in color and produced a small eggshell head.  Flavor shows more stout notes of toffee, roasted malt, and even a little chocolate.  Medium mouthfeel.

Sort of cherry colaish oddly enough. In a good way. Juicy cherry up front with subtle roast and chocolate notes. This is a lighter beer I assume because the body is less than most imperials. Super smooth and very easy to drink. Again I am reminded of a fantastic cherry cola made with real cherries. Chocolatey and lightly roasty on the finish but the cherry is what lingers along with nice woody vanilla notes. I dig this and I could drink this stuff all day long.

Smelling this blind, Id never peg it as something dark, just piles of cherry.  Really big sweet cherry at the start, a bit like pie, vague hints of roast and toffee in there.  Very tasty.  Finishes with a bit more touches of roast, but still pretty much hidden by the cherry.  Again, blind I doubt Id even pick up some of the stout notes, apart from it having a bit more body than Id expect from a fruit beer.

Very complex cherry profiles that goes from really sweet, to dark, to slightly sour. There is even a nice flavor of chocolate covered cherries, a little note of oak as well.

Some tartness and slight black cherry soda adds to the complexity.

4226,"2010-05-16",3.8,"(bottle) Pours a light reddish brown with a fast disappearing scant tan head which leaves sparse film on top.  Aroma smells EXACTLY like a Twin Cherry Bing candy bar, with some maraschino as well.  Its very sweet smelling when settled, but upon agitation the sweet cherry scent morphs into a spike of tartness and possesses a greater resemblance to the cherries that were used.  Regrettably, urinal cake is present as well, otherwise I would have awarded this at least a 9.  Taste is very strong of cherry,  and bears a very close resemblance to Belgian Red, but with added tartness.  There is some chocolate, but its really faint and overpowered by the cherry.  Could be some oak on the finish as it dries out a bit after the initial hit of sweetness with a subtle dose of earthy funk.  Exhaling reveals a taste of cherry popsicle stick.  Mouthfeel is thin for a ""stout"", and the carbonation is lively.  Certainly more of a fruit beer than stout, and I believe that if the stout qualities were more prominent it would possess more complexity than it currently displays.  Besides that, the urinal cake smell was regrettable, but it didnt entirely detract from the overall experience.  Overall, a good beer that I believe would be an interesting one to age.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

Not much stout character to speak of.  Its hard to get cherry cough drops or some other type of medicine out of your head upon the initial sniff.  Seems like a stout version of belgian red.  Flavor is better than the aroma.  Chocolate covered cherries. But has an annoying cherry cola like component to it which I was not digging.   Mouthfeel has that same lush, smooth, coat-your mouth texture that begian red has, though to a slightly lesser extent.  Sticky mouthfeel.  Well carbonated.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but i can see this being a great dessert beer- especially if paired with some cherry pie and ice cream.  Some highs and lows with this beer.

Loaded with cherries and a little dark roast in the back.  After sitting a while, a little vanilla bean finds its way in there and things even out a lot.

Flavors about the same as aroma, with a little more of the sour cherry coming thru along with a smidgen of malt. No roasty, toasty, stout qualities that I can find.  It is dark.

In the background, a kiss of roast, but hugely cherry and tastes quite similar to Belgian Red. Not that this is a bad thing. Some slight tang and vanilla. Interesting, definitely not what I expected.

Pours brown with an off-white head.  Nose is slight roast, slight chocolate, and lots of cherries.  Cherry overload.  Almost straight Belgian Red.  Flavor is similar, but when it warms the stout quality comes out: chocolate, roast, vanilla, some earth, and plenty of cherry but the slightly less than room temp beer backs the cherries off just enough for the other nuances to emerge.  Light to medium bodied for a stout and very enjoyable overall.  This guy wrote the book on fruit beers.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
4226,"2010-03-30",4.0,"Pours a deep mahogany that shows a deep, clear copper when held up to the light.  There is a short lived off-white head that recedes to a collar and leaves good lacing.

The aroma is seriously heavy on the cherries.  It smells almost like their Belgian Red, like a cherry lollipop, but with a subtle spiciness, presumably from the oak.  There is very little stout aromas outside of a hint of chocolate malts.  All about the cherries in the nose.

The taste is more of the same and I just wasnt prepared for the cherry flavor.  Ive had many cherry stouts but this one has so much more cherry presence than Ive ever had in the style.  Super-sweet cherries up front with a fleeting chocolate presence before the finish brings back the cherries for a sugary sweet finish.

The mouthfeel is fairly lively with lots of carbonation and much, much stickier than I was expecting with almost no roasted character at all.

4226,"2010-03-21",4.1,"Pours from the 12oz bottle a deep brown with a red hue and modestly sized off-white head that fades down a very dense film head. Aroma has a wonderfully deep dark cherry tangy tart note. Really smells like fresh cherry from the grocery store. Additionally, there are some smooth toasted and chocolate malt notes at the very tail end of the nose. The flavor is one of a kind and truly fantastic. Strong tart cherry flavor up front and in the middle. As this subsides a very nutty, toasted malt note melds with the fruitiness from the cherry and tasting finishes with a wonderful chocolate tart cherry combo that is one of the most awesome combination of flavors I have tasted. Body is moderately heavy with a high fine carbonation rate that gives a sharpness to the cherry tartness. Great lacing is left on the glass. Overall the tartness of this beer is very unique.

Dark brown color, perhaps a shade of red in there, nice fluffy tan/pinkish head.  Nice lacing.  Big whiffs of cherries in the aroma along with some malt, cookie, cough syrup (in a good way), and grains.  Authentic cherry flavors are sharp and delicious upfront, very much like Belgian Red at first.  Mid palate this switches gears and shows oak, soft milk chocolate, and caramel.  More Stout-like qualities in the backend but theres no mistaking that this is a Fruit Beer with cherries really standing out.

4226,"2010-03-15",4.2,"12oz bottle thanks to Merkin666. Pours deep dark brownish garnet with a 1 finger slightly pink off-white head that fades to a thick skim fairly quickly. Aroma is fresh, ripe cherries, hints of caramel, woody notes, overcooked biscuits, a hint of chocolate and a hint of toast really anything in the aroma is pretty tough to pick out if it isnt cherry related. Flavor is big ripe cherries up front, followed closely by dry grass, dusty toasted oak, toasted husky grain, light hints of roast, some earthy overtones near the finish along with a hint of salt and mineral. Palate is light to medium bodied with a somewhat syrupy entry, moderate strength prickly carbonation and slightly dry finish. Really good stuff overall, another fantastic fruit beer from New Glarus.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

Pours a deep reddish brown, but not hazy at all. Head is minimal. Flavor is sweet malts, earthy oak, followed by a mouthful of sour puckering cherries. Im thinking oak aging was definitely the right program here, the cherry flavor is intense and needed the earthy dryness of the barrels to even it out. Thin bodied for a stout, but very good in its own way. One is probably enough, this would get cloying fast. Well done though.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","WisconsinBeer"

It is a good cherry aroma, but would have liked to have had some roastiness in there too.  First taste is the sweet tart cherry and finishes with a nice lingering coffee/toffee/roasted flavor, then flips back to the sour tart finish.  Very clean, smooth, and creamy.  Medium mouthfeel.  End is oak barrel dryness.  Flavor lingers.  It seems, however, that the more you drink it, the less stout it tastes.  Overall, good for a fruit beer, but a bit of a disappointing stout.  Depends what youre in the mood for at the time, I guess.  Still...solid beer.

But it was much more Belgian red than cherry stout  not that is a bad thing, but with a name like cherry stout I was expecting a stout, but leave it up to New Glarus to twist the style guidelines, and I applaud them for that.  This one pours a clear mahogany with a thin beige head and frothy lacing.  Aroma of heavy tart cherries, malt, no real stout qualities.

Cherry nose with an absolutely ton of vanilla oak. Pours dark with red highlights; seemingly much higher ABV than it actually is (I’d have guessed 8.5%).  Like a sweet kriek in taste but totally dominated by its barrel character, sweettart layered over some chocolate cake, chocolate, maybe best described as Mexican hot chocolate with something like a cinnamon spiciness coming through, the bite and oak and everything also reminding me somewhat of a german chocolate bar with cherry-and-hot-pepper filling.

Just recently released by New Glarus, newest of the Unplugged series.

Beer pours a dark ruby brown in color with about an inch of off-white head leaving spotty lacing. Sour cherry pie in the aroma with hints of chocolate hidden beneath as well as some barnyard smells. Taste starts out with tart cherries, with chocolate and oak flavors in the middle, and then cherries again, it feels like its constantly changing while on your palate.

4226,"2007-09-19",4.3,"Mahogany body with cherry wood highlights.  Significantly less in stature than a traditional stout.  No head, just a wispy film with a foamy, off-white edge.  Tiny spots of sudsy lacing dot the glass.  The aroma is nothing short of intoxicating.  Fresh, sour cherries and lightly roasted chocolate malts comprise the base.  Theres also an utterly surreal scent of a snow covered conifer forest and freshly snapped oak twigs.  Incredible nose.  The flavor is almost as impressive.  Tart, chocolate dipped cherries, vanilla, oak, and a touch of new leather blend sublimely on the palate.  Perfectly balanced between sweet and sour.  The mouthfeel is light and silky, as the appearance suggests.  Smooth and incredibly easy to drink.  What a fantastic beer!","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

From a 12oz Bottle.  Mostly transparent, ruddy brown colored body with a thin layer of wispy white head.  Very pale for a stout, with a color more resembling a ruddy brown ale.  Big cherry fruit aroma, but has an overwhelming medicinal quality.  Marachino cherry.  Some moderate acetic notes gives it a bit of a cidery quality.  No roast or toasted characters noticeable in the aroma.  Medium light bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel with a prickly acidic quality.  Light acid, but whats there sharpens up the palate nicely.  As with the aroma, the flavors have an artificial, medicinal cherry quality.  Mild acetic acid presence, and seems to further contribute to an unpleasantly sweet cherry flavor.  Light chocolate malt flavors, but nothing resembling a stout.  Some cherry skin tannins emerge in the finish, helping balance out the sweetness somewhat.  A cherry flavor liners on the palate along with some hints of white pepper.  Big cherry flavor, but not a pleasant one and could really use more stout qualities to help balance it out.

From a 12oz Bottle.  Courtesy of footy.  Sampled 5/18/07.  Pours a semi-transparent, deep ruddy brown color with a nice layer of quickly dissipating, sudsy off-white head.  Tons of cinnimon in the nose, along with some freshly grated nutmeg and ginger.  Some lightly sour, cidery cherry notes as well.  Not really any dark malt or roasted malt presence in the nose.  Medium bodied, sparkling, tingling carbonation mouthfeel.  Very spicy flavors with some marachino cherry.  The nutmeg flavors come through strong on the palate, leaving a pleasant numbness left lingering on the tongue.  Finishes slightly sweet, with no real stout like qualities.

4226,"2007-07-19",4.2,"poured into tall tulip.  pours a quick dark ebony with full light frothy head.  sweet, mild, cherry aroma that begs you to take a sip.  my first impression was the lack of body on the palate, it had a very watery mouthful, and is my only criticism to this beer, carbonation is present on the front along with the sweetness from the cherries.  more sweet than anything on the initial, behind the sweetness the complexity shines, and the oak aged really compliments well with the cherry sweetness, the 8 barleys add a depth.  the aged presents itself nicely on the finish, cherries are on the front, the best part is the middle transition.  has a mild aftertaste, I can taste the mellowed nature after some moderate aging.  a very good and complex beer, i leave it thinking it was sweeter than I thought, more cherry, and a lot less body than I wanted, but it was wonderful thruout.

4226,"2007-06-16",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 10, 2009 6/16/2007:  New Glarus Unplugged Cherry Stout pours a clean, dark brown color.  In the glass the color appears to be brownish-ruby/purple!  The beer still has an adequate level of carbonation;  the bubbles are very fine now.  There is also a ring around the edges that is tan/mocha in color and lasts for the duration.  The nose is enticed by the aroma of chocolate-covered sour cherries, caramelized malt, some oak, aged alcohol.  The aroma smoothes out a bit as it warms.  The tongue is tickled by lots of wonderful sour cherry (real) with some chocolate, caramelized maltiness, and subtle oakiness.  The flavor is sweet at first, then tart toward the finish.  There is a hint of char in the finish as well.  Wonderful!  Similar to the aroma, the flavors all meld together and become even better as the beer warms.  The mouthfeel is smooth and the body of the beer is medium-full.  Damn, this is a nice beer.  Even the wife enjoyed it!  It is well-crafted and very well balanced.  Im not quite sure its completely a stout, but maybe more like an Old Ale or Eisbock.  Regardless, New Glarus does such a fine job on all of their beers, especially their fruit beers!  I would put New Glarus Unplugged Cherry Stout as #2 behind <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer/new-glarus-belgi Glarus Belgian Red as far as cherry beers are concerned...

7/08/2009:  New Glarus Unplugged Cherry Stout is holding on quite well.  It still has a deep, chocolate brown color, but there isnt too much of a head or accompanying carbonation left.  Cherry and dark chocolate waft from the glass.  The sweet and rich beer excites the tongue and delivers flavors of caramelized chocolatey malt, cocoa nibs, soft tart cherry, and aged dark tobacco leaves.  The flavors are well-balanced.  The body is medium to medium-full and it is smooth with just enough carbonation to open up the flavors on the palate.  I believe that this beer has aged well and will continue to due so over the next year or more...

Theres also sweet malt, chocolate covered cherries and a solid oakiness. Wow (again), lots of flavor. Im also getting some yeasty notes too.

Nose of sour yeast, mashed oranges, cherry pie, chocolate, candied sugars. Smells about as good as any other beer I have tried. Flavor of sour funk, yeast, oranges, chocolate covered cherries, some spice and some sweet notes. Finish is medium to long in length, average carbonation and medium bodied.

Flavor comes forth as a somewhat complex spicy tang, coconut, and sweet nutmeg dusts. Cherries a bit artificial and maraschino-like. Bubbly. Seems dulled and not at all stout-like. More like a cherry brown ale, spiced with nutmeg and mace. Certainly some cherry juice tang and bright yeast character. Perplexing, yet not entirely fulfilling.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

WOW can New Glarus can do Cherry beers! Amazing. Tart cherry at the front and sweet malt at the finish. As usual with every NG Beer Ive tasted, nice balance and smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full.

4226,"2007-05-01",4.2,"Hazy, due to its viscous nature, a stunning color is presented before me. The deepest possible of gorgeous reds, intertwined with deep shiny browns. Atop this beauty sits a thin and mostly diminishing off-white head, forming foamy and spotty lacing. The color is outrageous. The aroma is powerful, in fact badass. Fresh cherry pie, crust included. Definitely related(the cherries) to Belgian Red. Such a big fruit presence that any alcohol and starting roastiness is nearly totally masked. Not exactly a typical fruit infused stout aroma, but its wonderful. This may be one dimensional but its brilliant. Its also fresh, vibrant, exhilarating. You cant have exhilarating without rating. Flavor is nearly as nice as the aroma. Awesome mid-range tartness and light sourness in the flavor. Moderate bitterness and acidity. Touches of bitter chocolate and roasted malt. The cherries impart the slightest tart, medicinal touch near the finish. Otherwise, a stellar outing, no surprise. Finishes with a secondary explosion of sour cherries and doughy malt. Lightly carbonated, the mouthfeel is lightly sticky and light-medium bodied. Unmistakably New Glarus, unforgettable cherry character. Montmorency cherries are unreal. So is this brewery.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Sharp signature New Glarus cherry aromas with some oaky tartness and a sweet spiciness akin to cinnamon or nutmeg.

Very sharp, some cherry blended into all those aromas.  Taste is a little more sour than I was expecting.  Nothing ridiculous, but somewhat acidic.  Cherry seems to be the most dominant flavor.  Tough to call it a stout, it tastes more like a mild cherry lambic.   Kind of thick and a little creamy, get the slightest touch of vanilla.  Really cool taste, the finish is really smooth with a nice blend of cherries and tartness.  Well done.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
4226,"2007-04-25",3.7,"Dark brown beer with some mahogany hues when held up to the light.  Short lived foamy brown head with tinges of pink.  The nose is an odd mix of tart cherry, vanilla and wood tones, mixed with something like play-doh.  The tartness is very strong in this beer.  The cherry flavor is very natural, like fresh cherries.  Some sweet tart candy, and almost sour patch kids contrast between sweet and sour.  The stout is under there, with some chocolate and a hint of roasted grain, but it is a shadow compared to the bright fruit.  It is not easy to make a good cherry beer, and most brewers are not subtle enough to pull it off.  New Glarus does it very well, avoiding the nasty artificial flavors that mar many fruit beer attempts.  As kujo says, it does improve as it warms.

The aroma is dominated by mashed fermenting cherries, molasses, and a subtle yeast character.  The flavor is probably the strangest thing I have ever tasted.  When you look at it, you expect the normal roasty chocolatey goodness of your run of the mill stout, but, instead you are blasted with a very strong taste that can only be described as the exact taste of drug store chocolate covered cherries.  Afterwards, there is a pleseantly sour aftertaste that you feel all over your mouth.  Very loooooooong finish.  The mouthfeel is difficult to describe, but definitely pleseant.

Black with a tan head.  From that point on though, it really doesnt match up as a stout.  The aroma is largely a sweet and slightly tart cherry with malt hints underneath.  I was expecting more roasted malt in the aroma but the sweet cherry took control.  The flavor was where I was most surprised.    It was full of the same jammy sweet but somewhat tart cherry flavors that the NG Belgian Red brings.  After taking a little time to reset due to the surprise in flavor I did notice mild malt beneath the powerful cherry experience.

Poured deep ruby-brown, clear, with an average quick-diminishing off-white fizzy head.  Sweet oak and vanilla aroma, oddly reminds me of plasticene, not really much malt or hop character under the sweet bourbon, but the bourbon IS pretty soft.  The taste is - wow, thats interesting - as much like a Flemish sour as anything - not really stout-like at all - but sour cherry, oak, lemon juice, yeast and som bitter spice in the finish - God, I really like it, but I keep muttering ""weird!"".  The mouthfeel is silkiy, teeth-squeakingly astringent and sour, not much life or body but it doesnt matter much - lovely sour/acidic finish.

I tend to prefer more of the stout flavors which would be ideally complimented with cherry flavors.  So that is my knock against this beer.

A bit like wet wood and cherry, but that might just be my brilliant skill for reading labels.  The cherry flavor is violently aggressive initially, but  I expected more of a cherry nuanced stout - this is a loud cherry brew with some black malt and roasted flavors hiding deep inside.  That said, I like that the cherry is up front and the stout is subdued.  Flavor has a little touch of rich chocolate amidst all the acidity.  Deliciously tart and, of course, well done.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Aroma is dark cherry sweet and vanilla with a soda-esk effervescence. More like a malted beverage type of aroma then beer related.

Same goes for the taste, very soda, malt beverage like, overly sweet and cherry soaked with an unbalanced character that doesnt seem all that stout-like in character. Sweet and tangy with that certain tart cherry bite with no real mellow tones or subtleness. Its broad and rich with cherry. Unfavorably, however; and impartial to the buds. A nice experiment, but nothing to seek out or get worked up about. Unless sour cherry stuff is your thing, then by all means, this beer will suit your tastes just right.

Feel is deeply soured with cherry tartness and no balance within a slick, tart grabbing light/medium body.

You can tell its going to be interesting before even tasting it.

Had a small cherry aroma and a little in the flavor. New Glarus was overpowering with Cherries. It was hard to identify it as a stout. NG was very light bodied and very sweet. Sipping Bells after NG made it hard to taste anything cherry. Its basically impossible to compare these.

The flavor is dominated by the same candy like sweetness as the nose followed by some caramel,  and almonds. Balsamic vinegar shows up as it warms. I do not taste much stout in this one. Rather fizzy with nice mouth feel below the Co2. The beer gets better as you get down the glass, but it it tastes artificial (even though it probably isnt). Too sweet for me.  It tastes like a light stout with cherry concentrate and sugar added at bottling and then pasteurized???

4226,"2006-07-03",3.8,"I was slightly dissapointed with this Unplugged offering from New Glarus. Their other beers are examples of the fact that they normally go for the gusto when brewing a beer. This one falls short in my opinion. The pour is a see through reddish brown. It has very little head to speak of. You can smell cherries and grass, with a slight hint of oak. The problem with this one is that it says ""stout"" on the bottle. This is no stout, my friends. The mouthfeel is weak and thin. You get plenty of cherry flavor, not overpowering at all, and some oak in the taste as well--but it simply isnt as hearty as a stout should be. If they bulk this one up, it will be very good.

This is without a doubt the most Cherry beer I have tasted.  The stout is the perfect woody barrel setting for it, but it definirely lives up to the ""unplugged"" hype.  Its got tons of fruity sourness with just the right amount of sweetness, and in fact it is, ill say it, so fruity it is downright spicy.  These are almost hot cherries, a bit like a warhead.  Its got a nice long desserty finish.  Quite the treat!Its so good I want to guzzle it, but it deserves sustained appreciation.    Best not come at expecting a stout, but expecting a great fruit beer.  If theres any downside, its true the malt is subdued, but the big flavor of it, and the way it uses the stout to bring out a full woody cherry flavor, is no small feat in itself without tasting like a stout.  Hell, mix it with one of your other imperial stouts if you want to make it taste more like roasted malt.

Very fruity nose shows maraschino cherries and cranberries in a cakey chocolate background that cant but remind of a Forêt Noir. The fruitiness and alcohol pairing swiftly makes one think about rum. Sweet, cedary and leafy. The malts are beautifully extracted, but a generous acidity grows on parallel, in a fruity way, but Im not too sure how cohesive it all is and am not sure how far I dig the balance. It is certainly unique in this fashion, but generally speaking, I dont really enjoy tart stouts, the fruitiness makes it rather vinous and easier to work out here, but at the same time, it is very light bodied and very sweet to the point of leaving a slight sticky film around the mouth and I dont enjoy that too much.

4226,"2006-06-20",2.6,"2006 bottle from StewardofGondor (I may never drink all of the beers he so graciously sent) shared on 6/14/06.  A rapidly fizzling head (dark ivory/buttercream in color) almost immediately fizzles to a ring, leaving no real lacing, but a slight film behind.  The body is extremely dark, but ruby tinted on the edges and showing a medium-high to high clarity upon settling, unfortunately filtered and force carbonated, it seems.  Extremely forceful sweet cherries crowd in on the nose, giving way briefly, for some light tartness and hints of old, oily, dry oak notes.  Chocolate dots at the palate, with the requisite burnt, ashy black malts, but the cherries outlive, becoming sweet, nearly cloying in the nose and almost gummy/thick.  But it certainly is something to be smelled, being of medium-high strength and just bursting with sweet cherries.  Not unlike cherry pie, with a very light tartness in the backround.  In the flavor, the cherry overwhelms and what should be a dominant, dark, ashy, roasted malt is left wondering how it lost the battle to cherries.  Just like a day or two old cherry pie, it has that gummy, moist filling-like flavor, sweet and yet with some tartness.  Had I never tried Jolly Pumpkin, Id be more apt to find this interesting, but it just seems crude and forced, the barrel character being tart, but not cohesive with the syrupy, sweet, strong cherries and disjointed black malt character.  The high level of filtration certainly does not help things, as the beer goes flat and watery quickly, with a loose texture and lacking carbonation.  Tight, natural carbonation coud keep the sweet cherries at bay, while allowing more of the barrel character to develop.  It certainly does show aspects of wild yeast or, at least, heavy tannins and sharp wood, but it just isnt elegantly done, too brutish here, IMHO.  Alcohol is well-masked.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Luckily, any trepidation on my part was soon obliterated by the delicious cherry scent in the first whiff. I asked for a pint glass to pour a sample for a friend. It poured a nice dark stout color ( I couldnt tell much by the dim lighting in the bar). It looked nice and hearty, though. Now, the taste. Honestly, this would have been a good stout even without the cherry addition. But a large amount of Wisconsin cherries used in the brewing process make a very tasty brew. This wasnt that saccharine artificial cherry flavor that you find in most candies and chewing gum. These cherries are that Door County quality of sour/sweet that I love. The stout allowed woody hints to emerge as it warmed. The only think I can complain about regarding New Glarus Unplugged Edition Cherry Stout is that I only enjoyed a 12 ounce bottle.

4226,"2006-05-17",4.8,"UPDATED: MAY 18, 2006 12 oz bottle courtesy of The_Enemy. Im a huge fan a well done fruit beer, and New Glarus Unplugged Cherry Stout is an outstanding one in my opinion. This beer pours to a deep ruby red to brown color, with a soapy, pink head that fades, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic, with aromas of sweet and tart cherry, paired with mild vinous/oaky notes. The palate is soft, with good flavor of dark chocolate,  and malt, with a very pleasing, sweet/sour cherry back ground. This beer finishes with more dark chocolate and malt flavor up front, then ends with a sweet and tangy, cherry flavor that linger. Nothing ""stout"" like in this beer in a traditional sense. More of a wonderful fruit beer showcasing Wisconsion cherries, and 8 Wisconsin malts. This beer was so aromatic, delicious, and flavorful. It tastes like a liquid, chocolate covered cherry, and makes for an ultimate desert beer, or after dinner drink. I was really impressed witht this one, and the one bottle I savored, had my crying for more.  I LOVE this beer! One of the most impressive fruit beers I have tried in a very long time.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

4226,"2006-05-13",3.6,"Bottle from the Tosa crew and served in my La Chouffe tulip: Pours a mahogany hue topped by a medium sized beige fizzy head and good lace. The aroma has notes of semi-sweet cherry (duh), dusty yeast esters, a hint of cocoa powder, roasted malt and a touch of wild flower.  The taste is more like tart cherry on top of a mild bakers chocolate and barley. The cherry component is fresh tasting, a bonus point. Sure there is an oaky note on the finish but blink and you would miss it. The aftertaste in a lingering cherry sweet and sour flavor. Some pepper notes appear after a while. The mouth feel is sharp and lively and a tad watery.  The oak character is more noticeable on the lips than the palate.  Overall a nice brew that needs just a touch more rich malt to counter balance the fruit, it is more sour brown than stout.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

4226,"2006-05-12",4.2,"Big thanks to JHop for this one! Pours a deep maroon with a medium tan head than turns to a thick film over the top. The aroma holds a good malt character: some chocolate and coffee bean, vanilla elements as well as a strong cherry character coming through. The flavor is a bit of a different story, while some of those roasty stout elements remain, they are totally dominated by super tart sour cherries, the oaky characteristics come out a lot more as well. Later down the glass, I paired this with some 70% cocoa dark chocolate...this is one damn fine dessert beer...beverage for that matter. Would go well with most rich  chocolate desserts. One thing is for sure, this one is a sipper...the flavor is so intense you cant help but to sip this. Sort of sweet in the front, to a quick brunt tartness that goes till the oak starts kicking in torwards the finish. Complex...is an understatement for this one. Balances out more when it warms a bit.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"
4226,"2006-05-12",4.5,"Bottle. Thanks to Badgerben for the opportunity. Aroma is simply phenomenal. From the folks that brought us Belgian Red, I shouldnt be surprised that they nailed another Cherry beer...and I dont like cherries. Smells like I remember the Belgian Red, but perhaps with more malt. Actually kind of reminds me of the cherry equivalent of Kuhnhenn Raspberry Eisbock in the nose. Clear dark mohagany in which you can only see the carbonation when held closely to the light. Thin, tight bubble, tan head. Attractive brew. This is the fourth beer Ive had in my new Hacker Pschorr Weisse glass (yes, I know, not proper glassware for the style, but Im in housing limbo right now) and no lace to speak of. Either its the glass, or more likely the Palmolive Oxy detergent I used to wash it. Tart, but not as tart as I recall the Belgian Red to be. Also not nearly as carbonated a mouthfeel as the BR. This brew works better for me as I like the interplay of the chocolate malts and the cherries. Its a lovely combination that works oh so well.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"

Poured a burnished crimson body and a mediocre light tan head. The aroma was spectacular sour cherries blended with sweetened coffee! There was a wonderfully rounded suggestion of brett the wild yeast atop the cherries, lightly tart, oddly lactic, an off-kilter presence of vanilla beans and coco! The oak really stands out but not in the bourbon like smoky instance... more of a mildly spicy, almond, vanilla, walnut likeness.  I very much like the way the beer finishes a sweat & sour melding with almost a touch of nutmeg as a last mention. - A Wonderful Experience and something very unique!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

Somewhat musty aroma, with a healthy dose of caramel and cherries, of course.  Tart cherry flavor, also sour and not very stout-like in general.  This brewery excelsat fruit beers.

Fruitier than most cherry stouts, but expertly done.  Afew early mettalic notes, but they disappeared once it got a chance to breathe.

When I take a sip, Im confused... is this a stout brewed with cherries or is it a chocolately, dark, fruit beer? Light cocoa and big cherries in the flavor. Tart, but way too sweet at the same time.

4226,"2006-04-26",2.7,"A great disappointment.  Im a big fan of chocolate covered cherries.  No, not the overly sweet ones with thick sugar goo inside but the more upscale ones.  The idea of a nice, rich stout that combines chocolate and cherry flavor is enticing.  This wasnt.  A deep chestnut liquid poured out, topped by a small tan head.  The nose contained elements of cherries (dark and tart), chocolate, oak, and vanilla.  Yet is wasnt seductive.  Just there.  Too light in the body for a stout and too much carbonation.

4226,"2006-04-23",4.3,"Rating #200 with the brewery that started me on the path to drinking good beer many years ago. A lovely brown with a red hue on the appearance leads into a delightful combination of cherry and chocolate on the nose. On the palate, it reminded me of a Belgian Red more than a stout when warm, and more stouty when cold. The flavors are exceptional. The sour Door County cherries win the day for me. I used to eat these all the time in my WI days,and sampling them again in a stout beer was refreshing. Lots of vanilla and cinammon here as well, and a wonderful, long lasting finish. Excellent, and an approriate way to celebrate a RB milestone.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

Likewise, the flavor is noticably woody, but with noticable cherry flavor as well.  Try to think of it as having a cherry flavored popsicle, except the cherry flavor is real.  However, its kind of hard for me to get past the wooden flavor to it.  It has a decent body, and little carbonation to it.

So its an oak/dark cherry flavor that Ive never came close to before, aftertaste gets a bit too sour but hey it is fruit. Great mouthfeel and just too easy to drink. You really dont taste any stout to it but it is there to balance out the sour fruitiness. Im glad my g/f isnt home she would have killed this in a second, any woman would like this.

Still has that decaying orange pulp aroma with big whiffs of oak though it seems pretty dusty now. The head this time around is limper and doesnt last as long. Still tastes perfect...tart cherries, overripe orange pulp, vanilla, oak, white cake, chocolate, cocoa and a tongue prickling tartness in the finish. The look and aroma might have slid slightly, but the flavor might even be getting better...though 10 is as high as I can give it.

Aroma holds an overripe slightly sour smell that I associate with rotting oranges, but that I assume to be cherries. The oak aroma is definitely alive in there as well. My first impression from the aroma is that it smells like an orange laced Flemish Sour which is intruiging. 
<P>
Color is dark brown to black and the head is tan and diminished quickly to a dime thin affair.
<P>
Mmmm lots of tart cherry in the fore then very quickly you taste sweet cherry notes and then just as quickly chocolate malts play across the tongue. Very fast transitions of flavors. A sort of cake/eclair pastry like sweet and wholesome flavor flows from the middle to the finish. I swear I taste hints of over ripe orange juice and vanilla, but its probably the combined oak/sour cherry flavors merging to suggest that vanila flavor. The chocolate asspect seems to become less pronounced as it warms and more of the sourness and cherry comes through, though it never completely fades...it mostly just slides further back in the order and so you get more chocolate in the finish. Vanilla notes also come out as it warms along with more of the oak.

Very dark purple in color with a thin quickly discipating white head. Nose is mostly black cherry and green stems. Little bits of malts and roasted grains here and there. Taste initially very sweet ala belgian red at the middle it is much more sour then slowly to a more stouty character. Thin, at first but as this beast wars up more and more of the stout comes out. I can not stress this enough, this beer is very temperature sensitive depending on what you want. More chilly = more belgian red. More warm = more sout notes with definately more carbonation.

4226,"2006-04-03",3.4,"Any first impressions?
-A ring of foam surrounds the darkened ruby.
-The wooden barrel is apparent, giving a strong aromatic alcohol component to the sweet cherries.
-Once tasted, the cherries are definitely bigger than the stout; but Im not sure they mix well.
-Carbonation is quiet, like many other New Glaruses.

What if you dig deeper?
-The ever-pleasing Montmorency cherries offer plenty of their otherworldly sweetness and tartness.
-The malt roastiness needs more chocolate to unite the cherries with the stout aspect of the beer.
-Sadly, as I drink this, I want to switch to the Belgian Red, as we find here the exact same cherry apport, but thwarted by the stout.
-A fun fruit beer experiment, but I dont find it coherent enough.

The body looks somewhat thin, being nearly opaque but lettign enough light shine through that you can see the deep ruby mixed ino the normally brown stout.

4226,"2006-03-04",4.3,"Just when you thought New Glarus had done it all with fruit here comes the Unpugged Cherry Stout. In my opinion there is no other brewery that uses fruit as well  in any style of beer. Nice dark red color with a light aroma of bing cherries as well as vanilla. The body is a little thin but the flavors of oak and chocolate take over making it a nice change of pace for a stout. The more I drink the more complex the beer gets. Get this while you can as it will be gone soon and may never be back.","Minnesota, USA","beertime"
4226,"2006-03-03",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2006 Dark brown with red/orange hue. Fizzy light tan head, fades to nothing. Aroma has woody malt. Flavor... a nice concoction of sweet cherries, light oak, and some brown sugary coffee-cake malt. Slight tart and roasty finish. Smooth, sweet palate... nicely toned down carbonation. Really good beer, just want some Brett, please.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
4226,"2006-03-03",4.3,"12oz bottle acquired in trade with The_Enemy (as part of his surprise, unsolicited box of beers!) - thanks! Pours a deep ruby red color with a smaller sized off white head. Where to start on the aromas! Aromas of oak, vanilla, light cherries, light chocolate, some smoke, and whisky. Nice and complex with something new every sniff I took. Everything blended and worked perfectly. Tastes of strong cherries with light oak, vanilla and chocolate. Sweet and tart. In my book, New Glarus is definitely on top when comes to fruit beers.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
4226,"2006-03-03",4.2,"Poured a dark amber / ruby red color with a small, off white head that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of cherries, smoked malts, charred wood, and vanilla oak.  Taste of strong tart cherries (reminded me of the Belgian Red) with toffee malts, light roastiness, and vanilla oak.  Certainly an interesting creation, but not quite a stout... Thanks Steve!","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
4226,"2006-03-03",4.3,"Much thanks to hopdog for this...
Appears a dark toned brown with a red glow to it and an off white head that slowly fades. Decent streaks of lacing. Not very typical looking to a true stout.
Smell is awesome. Complex chewy vanilla, oak, tart cherries, along with enticing cocoa aromas. I really have to put the aroma on par with the Belgian Red b/c it takes me right back to that kick-ass brew when I inhale the wonderful aromas.
Taste is of the same aromas kicked down slightly a notch. Heavy cherry taste with cocoa and oak kicking around.
Mouthfeel is nicely mixed of tartness and sweetness with oak swirling around the palate. Medium bodied and mildly carbonated.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"
4226,"2006-03-02",4.1,"The make-or-break rating for this beer.  What pressure. Pours a deep, deep reddish brown with a good-sized white fizzy head that settles down into a thin creamy one.  The aroma is quite unique in my experience; it took a long time to tease out the various scents.  At first, I missed the cherry, though after a few more sniffs I found it.  Its a very tart cherry smell, not what I was expecting given the Belgian Red.  Mostly, though, to me, it smelled musty and moldy.  Im torn on my numerical rating.  Before I tasted anything, I didnt like the smell.  Now that Ive tasted how wonderful it is, I associate the smell with (and perceive the smell through) the whole experience, which improves my perception of it.  I could have gone 4 on the smell if the whole experience were crummy; but now I really like it.  Such are the whims of human perception.  In the mouth, its luscious and smooth, though theres still a carbonation bite.  Flavor starts off tart and cherry, then picks up a very pronounced chocolate note, which is deeper than any chocolate Ive had in a beer.  Most chocolate beers are very dark, bitter and smokey in their chocolate notes; this one was much more semi-sweet.  The tart cherries persist throughout and the aftertaste is an extension of the primary.  Yum.","Seattle, Washington, USA","acertain"
4226,"2006-03-02",4.3,"Thought I would get a noseful of cherry,but really didnt,a blast of chocolate and malt that had been sitting in barrels and just the tiniest hint of cherry. First sip,bam,theres the cherry,tastes like someone dumped Godiva chocolate into a Belgium Red.Someone has finally hit the perfect combination of mixing cherries into stout. This stuff is so good, I feel there is going to be a panicky run on it. Get it while you can","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"
4226,"2006-02-28",4.1,"What a great beer!  Nothing weak about this beer; it starts off with a very cherry aroma.  The aroma is matched by the tart cherry taste, though there is much more behind the initial sweetness.  Its still a stout, and there is plenty of dark chocolatey malt, licorice, wood, and alcohol.  The alcohol has an especially nice ""whiskey"" taste to it, which goes well with the cherries.  Smooth and drinkable, though maybe a bit thin?  Seems like it would go great something nice to smoke.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","Gurst"
4226,"2006-02-24",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2012 2006 vintage.  Pours to a deep brown color with lots of red hues when held to the light.  Its a transparent beer with a dense tan head.  The aroma is winey.  Almost portish.  I also get some licorice, light chocolate, and barrel aging.  The flavor is sweet cherries, tart ground cherries, and has hints of chocolate, heavy mineral water, wood.  An ever morphing flavor profile.  I like it for the cherries and then it switches into a metallic stout.  The palate is a touch too metallic at times.  Almost pervades between the flavor and palate.  Good, but I dont know if its ""that"" good.  2010 vintage seems to be just as good.8, 4, 8, 3, 16 = 3.9.   The 2012 vintage is phenomenal.  Super juicy (likely Door County) cherries meets chocolate stout.  Either the cherries are just that much better this year, or the quantity is higher than I remember.  Delicious sweet and tart Montmorency cherries.  Wow, is this beer easy drinking.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
4226,"2006-02-23",4.1,"Dark brown in color, but you can see a hint of red as it poured. A smaller tan head that settles to a thin lid leaving a sheet of lace. Again, some hues of pink in the head noticed. A rich zinfandel, mixed with port. Dark cherries, candied cherries, oak, pipe tobacco, dark chocolate, hints of corn bread and sorghum all are players in the aroma which carries itself well and does not repent. Light sweet cherries start and lead to a slight metallic feel. The front is all fruit with prunes and cherries, raspberries and a hint of apple. Actually quite sweet, but it works for this style. The last half touches on the malt. With Dark chocolate, mild oak, rye and a very light scotch. This is a great brew for an ofter dinner treat or night cap. I could se this on drying out over the next year and continuing to get more complex. The Belgian Red with some dark malt, a really nice change of pace.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
4226,"2006-02-23",4.3,"Somewhat thinning pour, settling in with a deep, translucent ruby color and darkening midnight brown tints for dimension.  What once fizzled on the surface for the head has abandoned the beer entirely, and now has an ink pool stretching across the top.  Aroma is abrupt and challenging - licorice root, rye, tarred shingles, burnt bourbon oak, black cherry cordials, vanilla beans and Swedish chocolate.  Quite a cacophony.  Later aromatic signals rouse up thoughts of cherry cola syrup.  Flavor?  Goodnight.  Sticky, slippery, tart injustice (but lovingly so.)  Cherry power chimes in early, not cresting too dramatically, as its countered with singed oak and stark black licorice.  All of this amidst rye.  Sooty remnants ashen on dark chocolate squares, transforming to a whiskey and rye one-two punch to juxtapose the tart like tugs delivered by said cherries.  Syrupy, viscous and a damn commanding palate presence.  Balance is remarkably well-composed.  Sticky, yet unprecocious and theoretically impossible to refine to one corner of the mouth.  Finish resounds with the more assertive elements of the beer, drawing from black licorice root tea, lactic dark chocolate melted over bing and black cherries, and ash trays with a few sprinkles of brownie mix.  Saddle up for a long, thoughtful experience with this one.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
4226,"2006-02-19",4.1,"Drank this right after the Kuhnhenn Raspberry Eisbock, which was unfortunate because its wonderful.  The first thing the nose reminded me of was my great uncles old, sweet, musty books, which was joined by a vanilla-esque, sour cherry, sweet barnyard aroma.  There was an initial, metallic flavor up front which disappeared on the next sip.  Fruity body was consistent throughout and a light finish made this beer an easier than usual stout to drink.  This beer is the perfect blend between the Belgian Red and the Raspberry Tart since it has the sweetness of the Belgian and the tart of the Raspberry.  This is barely a stout and borders on a Fruit Beer.  Definitely will purchase a four pack to hold onto for awhile.  Much thanks to hezron for getting this from the brewery today.","Seattle, Washington, USA","malachi"
4226,"2006-02-18",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2006 Smells like a used bookstore, when you are browsing the aisles of vintage books.  Also cherries and mangos (tropical fruitiness).  Deep brown, almost black with a thin creamy lacing.

Tastes like cherry soda with a chocolate aftertaste.  Light, dry finish that is smooth and easy to drink.  On second pass, I get malt, barley, earthiness and a slight bitterness.  An excellent addition to the Unplugged line.  Snap it up while you can.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
4226,"2006-02-18",4.2,"12oz bottle.Pours a dark red-brown-black that proves to be surprisingly clear when held up to direct light. Produces little head save a ring of bubbles around the rim that leaves small spots of lace here and there. Aroma is earthy, oak-piney, tart cherries, surprising amount of cinnamon, and pie crust -- basically an oven full of various holiday pies in a glass. Flavor is dominated by tart cherries as though this were their Belgian Red ale cut with their Road Slush Stout and a random holiday spice ale, with some roast grain bitterness providing balance, but with remarkably little dry-grain flavor for a stout. This is a fruit beer first and foremost; stout characteristics ride in the back seat. Playfully tingly but otherwise average palate with long tart/sweet cherry & cinnamon-spicy aftertaste. Very intriguing and extremely unique. The Unplugged series has been hit-or-miss for me; this one is an unqualified hit.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"
4226,"2006-02-18",4.3,"Bottle, picked up at the brewery.  Poured into my snifter.  Tons of cherry aroma with a complex, cherry pie sourness and an underlying chocolate malt note.  It is like sour cherry pie with chocolate malt balls mixed in.  Very nice as the sourness really stands out and it isnt mushy at all.  Color is dark, dark ruby-brown with an inch tall, off-white head.  Time for a sip.  Wow, initially a tart cherry sourness that is very bright.   Then it quickly to a strange sweetness that has some mineral character that slowly changes to a dry, roasted malt flavor that again morphs into a softer chocolate before finally coming full circle and back to the cherries.  That was all in the first two drinks!  The dry, grainy, roasted malt stands out way more than the chocolaty flavors the more I drink.  The wild, sour character is suprisingly strong.   Medium body with a slightly oily-creamy texture that is crisp in the finish.  This one isnt flabby.The only complaints I have are the mineral flavors associated with the sourness and that the flavors dont blend as well as I can imagine them blending.  Though the more I drink the more the sour flavor grows on me.  I like it a little better than the Belgian Red because it adds the dark malt roast complexity to an already great beer.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
