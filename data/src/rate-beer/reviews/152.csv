152,"2017-06-01",3.6,"Perhaps Im just the outlier here, but I found that this one tasted really artificial. Theres the usual Funky Buddha combination of a well crafted base beer (the underlying porter here is clean, slightly roasted, and bitter-dry at the end)augmented with a whole lot of wackiness. The coffee hit me first, and it was really great -- its strong and it mixes well with the porters flavors. But the coconut lingers, and after a while its the only taste that was left on my tongue. To me, it tasted artificial, with an unpleasant combination of chemicals and cloyingness. I tried to like it -- Ive enjoyed everything else that Ive had from FB -- but eventually the coconut grossed me out. Experimentation has some hits and some misses, and its not always for everyone. For me, this one didnt work.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

A- Coconut, dark chocolate.

A- Black color, black liquid, light brown head.

T- Toasted coconut, dark chocolate, mild sweetness.

P- Full body, average texture, average carbonation, balanced finish.

O- Hard to believe this isnt an Imperial Porter and clocks in at only 6.4% Most breweries cant pack this much flavor or depth into a big beer. Tastes just like a liquid mounds bar. Many great beers out there taste like this but maybe what makes this a touch better is the coconut is very much forward and has a toasted and natural taste and the chocolate isnt a dry roasted bitter cocoa flavor but a creamy dark chocolate taste. Damn tasty.","Ravenna, Nebraska, USA","HuskerTan"

152,"2017-02-13",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
This novelty sugar bomb lays out torrents of coconut milk and vanilla until a roasty middle leads to a quick finish touched by fruity acidity.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam crowns the brown-hued black.
-Mouthfeel is too viscous for this to have any sort of drinkability. This gets tiring quickly.
-The nose is exactly as advertised. Cant complain there.
-This brew lacks depth and actual beer flavors. Malt flavors are too few and far between; sugars seem to be the only flavour contributors.
-Adjuncts are so pungent, they overwhelm the glass AFTER youve rinsed it a couple of times. Dosage isnt part of the Funky Buddha vocabulary sometimes...
-FWIW, the Imperial version of this (Last Buffalo in the Park) actually has the girth and alcohol warmth to support all the sugary and perfumy adjuncts.

In taste a bit worse but still good. First coconut sweetness countered by acidity from black malts and not countered by malt sweetness (actually there was no malty backbone there and the beer is quite light bodied and dry). After drinking more and more it became more round and had more body. Light to medium body (I was expecting it to be more bold, but it was ok), creamy texture and soft carbonation, finish is rather sweet. Great aroma, lacks a bit on malty/body part but looking on it in overall it is really tasty dessert.","Poznań, POLAND","mateuszk"

152,"2015-06-19",3.5,"Bottle (22 oz). From Marcus, thanks! Split with the Québec crew.

Appearance: Dark brown with a small brown head and little lacing. 

Aroma: As usual with Funky Buddha, the aroma is so intense that it makes you wonder how they can achieve that. Burst of coconut and coffee along chocolatey notes and vanilla. If you dont like coconut, you will hate this beer... fortunately I like it. 

Taste: Here is gets a little cloying and it feels artificial with so intense coconut, coffee and chocolate as well as some vanilla notes. Sweetness level is medium. What is cloying is that the beer too much flavorful / artificial rather than the sweetness.

Palate: Medium body, but borderline watery. Lacking quite a bit here. Lingering artificial flavors of coconut and coffee. 

Overall: I like the aroma, but this is overdone and cloying. Its unfortunate because the Buffalo trace barrel-aged version of this was a personal favorite for me at the last EBF. They make good ""festival"" beers as they are really enjoyable in tiny portion but its not something I would drink on a regular basis.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

152,"2015-04-08",3.1,"Pours a black color, with ember red edges and a decent, soon vanishing head.

Smells of ground coffee, coconut and mousse au chocolate big times. The coffee is especially well pronounced, while standing against the sweeter aromas of the beer, it reveals earth, toffee and hazelnuts. The nose offers a unique blend, which turns out to be less sweet than expected, with a well balanced infusion of bitter coffee, accentuated by roasted coconuts.

Has a smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied beer.

Tastes of bitter coffee beans, accompanied by a metallic carbonation, increasing the tastes bitterness, while providing a vivid creaminess. Coconut and Nutella add a lot of character to the beer, which doesnt turn dessert-like at any point, due to the distinct coffee presence. It implements an earthy toffee flavor very effective though, which turns a tad metallic during the finish, reminding me of cold coffee. 

Easy drinking beer, which got a decent complexity to it, turning out a bit too thin and metallic during the finish. Also the bitterness is a bit too harsh, compared to the weaker implemented sweeter flavors of the beer, initially promising a decent balance. The beers interaction between coffee, bitter chocolate and slightly wooden coconuts is very enjoyable though, while the brew remains recognizable as a Porter.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Best use of coconut Ive ever Petered. Most beers with goofy chocolate and coconut additions tend to be @ gross in my experience, but white chocolate and coconut in this beer were represented about at clean and invitingly as possible. Chill cream milk chocolate coffee and roast provide a fun base. Surprisingly dry. Much more drinkable than expected. Nose is quite inviting, but in the end a touch too much hazelnut flavored coffee is offered. Quite hard to pull off these goofy additive beers, but this funky boost a brewery does better than most it would seem. 12 oz pour. 6- 8 oz or so would be nice size for this where Im @.  enjoyable at first, but too much sweet vanilla hazelnut coconut as warms.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"

Aroma like whoa: a huge blast of maple syrup, coconut, chocolate, and vanilla erupts immediately after flipping the swingtop. Previous batches Ive tried didnt have this maple character, and while those aroma were also incredible, I do like the addition.  Roasty at the same time; some bitter black coffee remains too. I cant stop smelling my glass; Id instantly purchase a bulk supply of Last Snow scented candles if they made them. 

Much of this bleeds over into the taste, yet it lacks the magic held by the aroma.  Palate is quite good but not mind-blowing the way the aroma is.  This is one of the few empties I refuse to wash just so I can drop by for a quick whiff again for the next few days.

Pitch black with a one finger light beige head that quickly settles into a lasting ring. Spotty lacing left behind. 

Sweet malt aroma with a nice balance of silky chocolate, coconut and subtle roast. The chocolate presence is really strong with hints of milk and dark cocoa as well as some lactic cream. Theres also a good bit of coconut/coconut milk in the nose that makes this beer smell kind of like a candy bar. Its slightly in danger of smelling artificial but theres a nice roasted malt presence underneath. Hints of robust coffee, toast, oatmeal and toffee round things out and make it feel more like a beer than a milkshake. 

Medium bodied with a nice balance of sweet chocolate, coconut and roasted malt notes. Very sweet up front with lots of silky chocolate and lactic cream. The chooclate is so prominent that it almost tastes like a syrup was added. This is nicely complimented by a coconut milk presence that lingers over the roasted notes Ito a sweet and slightly dry finish. Theres a nice roasted malt presence underneath that cuts some of the sweetness and makes it tastes more like a porter. Some robust coffee bean flavor along with dark chocolate, oatmeal, caramel and toffee. Still really sweet but just enough roast to keep it from becoming overwhelming and one dimensional.

152,"2012-06-12",3.7,"On tap at Churchkey.  Served in a mini snifter.  Pours near black with a thin head and a few spots of lacing.  The nose carries heavy, heavy chocolate along with a touch of underlying roast.  Mild coconut in the background.  Then more chocolate.  Hersey-syrup-type chocolate.  A bit cloying as it warms a bit.  Flavor is more heavy chocolate with some underlying coconut character.  Some roasted malt beneath.  This is a hard one to score as there really isnt much underlying beer; its really heavy chocolate, though not what youd get from chocolate malt.  I cant knock the nose too much, as it was really wonderful, but have taken that into account in my overall score.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
152,"2012-06-09",4.2,"Draft. Dark brown color, tan head, nice lacing. Aroma of bright vanilla and coffee grounds. Taste is similar. One of the best beers of the night.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"

152,"2012-06-07",4.1,"Draft at Churchkey for the Bluejacket/Funky Buddha/Cigar City event during SAVOR week. Poured a near-pitch black color with a tiny off-white head. Aroma is like a Mounds candy bar - fresh shaved coconut in there - with a nice chocolate notes. Roasted malt notes, nice coffee notes. This one is pretty darn good.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
152,"2012-06-07",4.0,"Tap at CK. Pours a deeper clear ruby. Massive off white foam. Big rocky retention. Nose is out of this world. Super rich espresso, coconut hazelnut frappacino. Taste is a little weak but this is not an imperial stout. Thinner than expected with rich frappacino character. The rich Dunkin Donuts iced coffee nose and taste is uncanny but still a bit contrived for me. Could simply be not even a beer if it were given to me blind. Delicious. Tangy lactic palate. Sharper coffee finish. Liked this one a lot. But more of a Starbucks concoction than a porter.

152,"2012-06-07",4.2,"On tap at the Prohibition Taproom.  Dark brown with wispy beige foam.  Nose is coconut, coffee, chocolate and caramel.  I love coconut and this smells unreal.  Creamy with a tingle but not thick.  Taste is dark chocolate and toasted coconut.  Obviously a Mounds bar comes to mind.  Sweetness is balanced with coffee bean.  Crazy good.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
152,"2012-06-05",3.8,"On draft at Prohibition. Overwhelming coconut and dark chocolate. Like a Mounds bar.

152,"2012-06-03",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2016 Draft with Vinny. [resampled at GABF 2014 w/ Andrew]  Pours a deep hazy brown body with light lacing. Aroma is coconut and vanilla - pure desert-beer bliss. Mouthfeel is smooth and delicate with notes of coconut, vanilla, mounds bars, samoa girl scout cookies, cinnamon, light chocolate and muted coffee. One of the best porters, period.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
152,"2012-06-03",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2012 Pitch black body, small cream light brown head, spotty lacing.  Aromas of coffee, almonds, chocolate, vanilla, and coconut.  Flavor is very similar with a huge amount of coffee and coconut.  Mediulm-full bodied, assertive carbonation, moderately sweet.  Nice complexity, but ultimately I am not the biggest fan of the coconut.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
152,"2012-06-02",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2013 On tap at Capones, pours a pitch black with thin clear bubble head, no lacing. Aromas and taste of mounds bar, ample dark chocolate, toasted coconut, espresso, vanilla bean, roasty malts, marshmallow. So drinkable at 6.3%. My favorite of the event. Cheers Ryan. Tried again at monks, just as much mounds bar, this shit is insane!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
152,"2012-06-02",4.1,"Draft at Capones.  Pours black with little head. Nose is coconut cream pie and slight black malt. First sip is amond joy and espresso with a sweet finish of coffee and dark chocolate. awesome beer.","Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, USA","Macegan75"
152,"2012-06-02",4.3,"Pours black with a fine creamy head.  Nose is fresh, rich, and lush coffee beans, vanilla, fine coconut and perhaps a dab of dry dark chocolate.  Mouth is focused on the fresh coffee beans, very rich in that way while still being light and dry.  Really good coconut and cocoa flavors dance around.  Palate is light and bouncy, I really appreciate the nuance that went into this.  Impressive.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
152,"2012-06-02",4.7,"Pours black with a creamy dark tan head.  Aroma has excellent taosted coconut and coffee notes.  Flavor follows suit...simple and just perfect.  Mouthfeel is medium/full and silky with a lingering coffee finish.  Fabulous!","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"

Great flavor, fairly sweet but very tasty.  Sweet toffee, bitter but smooth mocha, and very big coconut.  Smooth buy dry on the mouthfeel with medium body.  Like a thinner Three Hour Tour.  Very nice brew.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
152,"2012-03-13",4.1,"Im not a big porter or stout fan but this one was good, smelled of almond joys. Tons of coffee in there as well. The taste is just like the dang candy bar which is pretty cool, mixed with a big cup of coffee. I might be able to get by with a porter like this.","Florida, USA","Gnat628"
152,"2012-03-13",4.2,"On draft at Hunahpu Day 2012.  Pours a porter brown with an off-white head.  A simple-looking, somewhat unassuming beer, but when placed near the nose, bam! it smells of coffee, roasted malts, cafe con leche, coconut, slight cinnamon, and a hint of spice.  The best coconut, chocolate coffee, ever.  Flavor is similar- coconut, chocolate, coffee, and spices make for a wonderful blend.  Light to medium in body for a porter, but very nice overall.  6.3%? I would have said much more, but I would have drank much more, too.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

152,"2012-03-12",4.4,"Poured dark black color, aromas of chocolate, coffee, coconut, vanilla, and roast.  Smelled like a fresh bag of macaroons that was just opened.  Flavors are huge on vanilla, chocolate, and coffee.  The coconut was present and not as overpowering as I expected, another great beer produced by the Buddha.","Florida, USA","burg326"
152,"2012-03-12",4.1,"Draft at Hunahpus Day 2012.  Arguably the biggest surprise of the entire day.  The pour yields a dark mahogany that shows thinner chestnut translucency at the edges.  A small patch of mocha foam sits at the head, leaving little lace behind.  The nose is flat out amazing.  Based in rich dark chocolate and exceedingly fresh, earthen coffee roast, there is a beautifully sweet coconut profile that lends a Mounds bar quality to the brew.  I heard someone say German chocolate cake dipped in espresso, and that wouldnt be far off from how this smells.  Flavors fall right in line, expertly balanced between the sweetness of the fresh coconut, the richness of the dark chocolate, and the roast of the dark coffee beans.  Man this stuff tastes great!  The palate is the only letdown here.  I certainly appreciate the (relatively) low gravity of this beer amidst a sea of imperial-this and imperial-that, but the mouthfeel borders on downright thin.  Though it is well carbonated, a little more body would go a long way.  Overall...excellent.  Some body would push this into legendary territory.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
152,"2012-03-11",4.2,"Nose is full of roasted coffee with some coconut and vanilla. This one took me by surprise. Dark, creamy pour with off white head. Taste is heavy coffee and chocolate with some vanilla in the mix. Very nicely done porter.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
152,"2012-03-10",4.7,"Dont know what to say. Smelled like those vanilla cappuccinos that you get at 7-11. LOTS of vanilla, coffee, coconut, pound cake and roast. The flavor was somehow just the same, only with a smooth carbonation that gave off a light earthy and more roasted/dry finish. One of the best beers Ive ever had.","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
152,"2012-03-10",4.8,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2012 Pours dark unclear coffee in color with a decent tan head. The perfect aroma is cooling roasted coconuts so sweet and pleasant in the nose.

The Buddhas finest effort to date.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
152,"2011-02-20",4.4,"On draft at the Buddha. This beer is good, crazy good!! The aroma is what really blew me away. Kevin, one of the brewers there, told me this one had coconut rum flavors along with coco nibs. I wasnt sure if Id be able to taste every single flavor he mentioned but I  did, and it was simply amazing. It has that chocolate presence that the normal piti porter has but with a good coconut rum kick to it. Not too boozy and very easy to drink. These guys at the Buddha really have their beers nailed down to a science.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
152,"2011-02-16",4.2,"Draft This beer rocks! Cloudy, dark brown ale with a small, creamy, khaki head. The nose is a luxurious swirl of big-time coconut flanked by modest notes of caramel, vanilla and deep roast coffee. Medium to full-bodied and milky with relaxed carbonation. The flavor is moderately sweet and presents a lovely mélange of robust coffee, rich coconut and mild chocolate. Roasted cocoa and toasted coconut finish. With a base beer this good and creative treatments, its hard to go wrong here. World class beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
