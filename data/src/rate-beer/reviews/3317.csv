Yes, has the effects of a cheap pale lager but not sure how this gets to be a zikle! Good overall civility and com[parable to many well brewed pale lagers. Funny name considering it doesnt want to be known as a pale lager, heheh. I think Ive had other ziks that are much more enjoyable; siggy saggy siggy saggy yoi yoi yoi!

3317,"2017-02-18",3.4,"This one is pretty straight ahead and kinda rustic, but it is pretty good for what it is. It has a pleasant smooth aroma and pours with a nice foamy head. It tastes like a best possible iteration of the kind of macro euro swill that probably seemed exotic when you first started drinking. It has a smooth drinkable vibe that makes it appealing for those times you arent up to sessioning IPAs or most intense beers, but dont feel quite like slumming it with the pale lagers. Another fine effort from Jacks Abby, which has quickly become one of my favorite breweries.","New Haven, Connecticut, USA","meccahh69lol"

Very light hops, actually, just a touch of grass and orange. Bright golden, cloudy, medium head. Very rich and malty, though not with real Franconian complexity. Bready, but also some dough, a bit worty too. There are not enough hops either, really that part disappoints from JA, because they do so many hoppy beers so well. Its sweet and heavy, with body and sweetness approaching a heller bock. Its almost 3 months old now, which could explain it. Would like to try it fresh on tap.

3317,"2016-07-13",4.0,"This was poured into a pilsner glass.
The appearance was a crisp yellow color with a nice carbonation seen rising at a moderate pace to fill a fingers worth of white foamy head. Quick dissipation. Barely any lacing.
The smell started off with sweet biscuits, light honey, and a breast malt. 
The flavor was mainly the same with a nice lingering sweetness in the aftertaste and a sly sweet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body. Carbonation runs light enough to allow enough breast sweetness to be slightly sticky. Good smooth feel for the most part.
Overall, really great Helles lager. Thats what JA says it is, though I see ratebeer has it as a zwickelbier....hmmmm....going with what JA says.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3317,"2016-06-23",3.8,"Undated can. Luminous blonde with suspended microscopic particulate. Broken, nonuniform white head. Clean and airy aromas of fresh baguette, flowers (Hallertau), new mown hay, sourdough, and mild lemon. Relaxed carbonation. Starchy malt and understatedly juicy lemon notes offer a pleasant fullness on entry. Soft body, with the faintest scratch of minerals adding contrast. Mild nectar flavors are caressed by a slick body that brings to mind oily flower petals. Remarkably clean, with just enough residuals providing a wildflower honey sweetness amid the refined lemon accents. Snap of characterful, but unobtrusive, yeast adds a touch of muscle to the perfectly polished attenuation. Decoction-mashing has rendered a commendably edgeless and succulent pils malt character which possesses the pillowy softness of baguette flesh, sans crust. Floral hops remain seamlessly entwined with the ever so delicate malt in the yeast-kissed, off-dry finish. After having visited Franconia 7-8 times, blindly Id peg this as something from that blessed region. A supremely soft, cohesive, and authentically rustic lager that demands large gulps.

3317,"2015-03-29",4.3,"My Bottom Line:
The noblest straw rises, as soft cereal sugars are tickled by herbal hops for a beautifully authentic recreation of a Franconian Landbier.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the misty straw blond.
-The mouthfeel is at once cushy and lean.
-Drinkability is as high as you can imagine.
-This is not a New World version of an unfiltered German lager. Feels good, for once.
-The finish is barely bitter, focusing instead of the softness of the malts (think of fresh baguette crusts) and a light rusticity.
-Dont drink this one too cold to let the delicate malts express themselves fully.

3317,"2015-03-29",2.4,"Arômes de lager commerciale. Très malté, odeur de grains de céréales, levures pils et abricot. En bouche, malt, sucre artificiel genre splenda, pain mouillé, léger citron, abricot, cantaloup. Amertume quasi nulle et finale très brève. Effervescence bien faible et corps bien mince. Surement un bon produit pour les amateurs du genre mais pas mon style malheureusement.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","Franckg"

3317,"2015-03-22",3.9,"Bottle from some liquor store around the corner from trillium. 
Lightly hazy deep straw color with a smallish quickly dissipating bone white head. Initially some sulfur and skunk when the bottle was first opened, but that went away quickly. Bready sweet pilsner malt with with spicy earthy floral hop aromas. The taste is malty sweet with a hint of bread crusts. Light earthy spicy hop flavor. Light bite of carbonic acid on the tongue, medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Very nice kellerbier, well made lagers are so under appreciated.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
3317,"2015-03-15",3.6,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2015 Pours a hazy light golden with a small and resilient white head that leaves nice lacing. Nose is of nice cereals and herbs. Taste is lightly sweet and offers some nice crackery flavors. Not perceivably bitter but clean and really drinkable. Body is light to medium (am I missing something? Commercial description says ""full"") and carbonation pretty high. Still, really drinkable and tasty. Overall I must say that I really enjoyed this one. Would love to quaff this during the warmer months (between all the saisons, berliners and goses that is)!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

3317,"2015-02-27",3.6,"I like it when breweries make beers of very obscure (but traditionally recognized) styles. Though it makes it difficult to judge a beer like Jacks Abby House Lager since I have no real frame of reference. Falling under the umbrella of the pale lager family it works pretty well as it has a clean taste with some distinctive character and is quite refreshing and easy to drink. If only it werent as expensive as some of their bigger, better brews.

I poured a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 1/5/15 and cost $4.99 ($0.30 per ounce).

Appearance: Slightly hazy shade of yellow/gold. Pours to a two-finger, white, creamy head which laces and retains quite well.

Smell: Pale malt with slight citrus and spice, though mild overall.

Taste: Slightly sweet malt is prevalent immediately. Almost chewy in its authentic malt taste; akin to a cream ale without the adjuncts or any kind of pale lager with actual flavor. Theres a subtle lemon character here: lemon fruit, pith, peel, rind and grass. The faintest citrus flavor along with minor black pepper spice (likely due to Noble hop varieties, though the brewery doesnt list them specifically). Finishes very clean with that classic lager character found in most brews of the general style. This is definitely more flavorful and authentic than any kind of macro lager, or even a craft lager of the Style 1 category, but not to the point of being amazing or especially memorable. Its a good beer that accomplishes what it intended to do.

Drinkability: I found Jacks Abby House Lager so refreshing that I drank half my glass on the first pull. Thats a good sign for sure. Though I will admit the mouthfeel is not quite as crisp as Id prefer. It does finish clean, though. At 5.4% ABV I was expecting a bit more body and complexity. This would be quite tempting to session in the summer (especially if it were available in cans, hint hint!)","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
3317,"2015-02-23",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2016 Fresh 2015 bottle, drunk February 2015Deep golden with some moderate copper tints and an off-white head that is small but well-retained.Pepper and dough in the nose give a rustic feel to start things off, while a bit of breadiness lingers on the end (brown bread, light honey notes, more peppery hops). Not a powerful aroma, but whats there is pleasant and light.Flavor catches me off guard. Where Im expecting a very hoppy, dry lager, its quite a good deal maltier and minimally hoppy. Earthy, peppery hop notes remind me of something like spalt or northern brewer. No idea what the hop actually is, but its not bursting forth with grassy hallertau or juicy golding notes. Which is fine. The beer is much more malt-focused and interesting in that respect. Nice to change it up from the seemingly endless supply of hop-focused beers these days. Drinkable, still dry in the grand scheme of things and with no flaw or wateriness that I can find. 7/4/7/4/15.More samples on draught, 2015 and 2016.  Most recently on tap at Miracle of Science, 1/27/16.Wow, this is much better than I remember, with tons of herbal-spicy hops and a malty but very dry character.  Not too heavy on the breadiness and very crisp on the finish.  Rating updated.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
