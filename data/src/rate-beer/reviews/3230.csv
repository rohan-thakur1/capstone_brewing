3230,"2017-06-09",2.8,"160517. On tap at Hop Scotch. Third beer from a tasting paddle. Typical pale lager with all of the qualities that make pale lagers one of my least favourite beer styles. Grainy aroma of wet straw, thin bodied, clear golden colour and soft white head.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
3230,"2014-03-18",2.9,"On tap at Bluetrain, Melbourne. Hoppy, wheaty, aromas with a hint of banana.
Golden blonde, fine carbonation. Palate is crisp and quite dry, but just right for a lager. Tastes fruity, estery with full flavours of peach, wheat and sunshine.
Overall, fairly balanced and refreshing.","Kyoto, JAPAN","Westkyoto77"

3230,"2012-10-12",3.3,"On tap at the Irish Pub in Albury. Served a good golden color with a decent head that fades to some lacing. Aroma of what seem to be honey sweetness and grain. Taste of some honey sweetness and a bit of hops crispness with a bit of grain in the background. Mild bitterness and a clean finish. fairly light body, crisp, quite smooth and refreshing. Nice balance. Not a bad beer for the style. Much better than expected. Good for a few.","St. Charles, Missouri, USA","Bif"

3230,"2011-11-12",3.1,"Ill buy the commercial descriptor this time. A good effort for what is nearly always the pits of the beer world. Some medium strength malt sweetness is the key differentiator here lending a nice layer of flavour to what is a very quaffable beer. Consumed from a growler sampler! (thanks to Thunder Rd) but held good form the whole way through.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"
