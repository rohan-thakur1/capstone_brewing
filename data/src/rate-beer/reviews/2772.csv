2772,"2015-09-12",3.2,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a dimple mug. 

Aroma - On the initial pour, lots of butterscotch. Thereafter, toffee/ wood/ vanilla comes into the fold. 

Appearance - Deep, copper/ bronze. Creamy off-white head. 

Taste - Burnt toffee, blond coffee, butterscotch, wood, faint fusel alcohol on the back of the palate. Resiny, almost harsh, hops bring up the rear and unfortunately detracts from the beers overall make up. Layered, malty flavors upfront are very enjoyable but the balance is sadly off. 

Palate - Medium bodied. Semi dry

Overall - Malt flavors impress but hops need some restraint. Good beer otherwise.","Massachusetts, USA","micmillon18"
