3015,"2017-05-30",3.4,"Bottle:
Perfectly clear and still.
Fairly potent initial alcohol and rice aroma....which then fades.
Taste is like water, with a dash of alcohol and a handful of rice....waved over the top of the glass....( like a desert-dry martini, where you pick up the vermouth bottle an inch and set it back down....its the intent that counts)
Hard to rate this one, really.....almost without flavour, but remarkably smooth and clean....
High marks for its delicacy and purity.
Very nice.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"

Location: Bottle at Ra Sushi - Baltimore, 11/3/14


Aroma: It has a fruity aroma, with a bit of booze, fairly light otherwise

Appearance: This one pours a clear golden color, not much else going on

Flavor: This feels a little sweet and a little boozy, much like the aroma would suggest

Palate: The body is light and a little thin, the mouthfeel is only okay

The flavor is boozy, but mildy so, with a sharp, but not acidic rice and alcohol flavor.  To me, this is the basic flavor of sake, and served chilled makes for a good, affordable sake to drink.

Medium body with no carbonation. Starts like a fruit confection (not sweet - just fruit), but the alcohol arrives quickly and obliterates the fine points.

3015,"2006-06-02",3.1,"This sake has an aroma similar to that vodka would have, were it sweet. It is surprisingly smooth and not at all harsh. The flavor is semi sweet with a gentle aftertaste of manilla envelope adhesive. It is quite pleasant overall. This ia a very drinkable sake.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","River"
3015,"2006-06-02",3.1,"Clear body, with a light aroma.  Some light grain accents are evident as well as maybe some tofu.  Very sweet initial taste, refreshing, that has as one drinks it a nice light alcohol burn in the back of the throat.  Ending for some reason reminds me of cookie dough, sweet and pastry like.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Numenor"
3015,"2006-06-02",3.2,"Smells like moonshine.  Good moonshine, that is.  Only 14.5%??  Whoof.  Well, it does start out very gently, almost watery, and end up with a light burn.  All right.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","starfireming"
3015,"2006-06-02",3.2,"Crystal clear color. Sweet light rice aroma, clear evidence of alcohol. Very smooth, flavors similar to vanilla and grass.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","maniac"

3015,"2006-03-08",3.0,"Chilled.  Pours crystal-clear.  Light, sweet aroma of rice and alcohol, maybe a hint of vanilla.  Flavor is rice and alcohol, but with less of a burn than any Futsu-Shu or Junmai I have had.  Some alcohol burn in the finish, however.  Mouthfeel is pretty smooth and rounded.  A decent sake.","Portland, Oregon, USA","BobbyW3363"
3015,"2006-03-02",2.8,"300mL Bottle: Pours clear, yellow tinged, nose of mold, cotton and prune and golden delicious apples. The flavor is whoa strong with alcohol and the associated burn, a bit of fruitiness in the flavor and some buttery notes. The finish is ripe and wet, but brief. A bit of character and umami to this otherwise strong dose of alcohol in a glass.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3015,"2006-01-16",2.4,"pours clear neutral nose with some alcohol and tofu notes.It has a alcohol bite that really hurts at first but as you get through the bottle you notice it less and less.With its jet fuel like character it may be just the ticket for a sakatini","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","beerhandy"
3015,"2006-01-02",2.5,"Kind of a rough drinking sake, the alcohol being almost abrasive as it goes down.  Crystal clear, it has a perfumey, grassy aroma heavily laden with alcohol.  The flavor is grassy, quite strong with the alcohol, with the barest hint of light fruits near the end.  The finish is an alcohol burn.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? Wine & Spirits, Downers Grove, IL<font size=-1>","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
3015,"2005-08-02",1.8,"Not sure how to rate this. Body is trasparent. Aromas are rubblign alcohol, vodka, some spices? Taste is harsh, aocohol, lettuce, grass. Ill have to re-rate once I learn more about this style.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"
3015,"2005-07-23",2.3,"Bottle.  Strong alcohol aroma - hints of rice and soy sauce.   Looks exactly like water.  Primarily soy sauce flavor  with a slight hint of lemon-  served cold its pretty smooth.   As this is my first sake rating, the number are a bit arbitrary especially with the flavor rating.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"

3015,"2005-05-27",2.9,"bottle.. Pours crystal clear... Aroma is of vanilla and alcohol.. Flavor is fruity with alcohol and a smooth vanilla finish.  Medium mouthfeel with a alcohol burn but it finishes smooth.. My first sake.. I cant say that this would be something I would drink regularly but I will be trying more..","Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, USA","Ray1975"
3015,"2005-02-18",3.2,"Nice clear as water color,some what fruity and vanillaish aroma.The flavor was quite nice up front with a slight fruity flavor and being fairly smooth in the beginning.The alcohol hits in the middle coming on kind of harsh at first making you think this is going to be a booze ride from hell but it stops short and finishes up nicely and smooth.Thanks go to BeerandBlues2 for sending this brew my way.

After letting this brew warm up a bit it actually starts to get a little better.I believe ice cold is not the way to enjoy this brew since it seems to take away some of the flavor in the beginning but warmer also hikes up the alcohol burn a bit too.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
3015,"2005-02-03",3.8,"Served at 58F. A distinct yellow hue permeates this otherwise crystal clear beverage. Thick legs form when swirled. The aroma is quite assertive. Strong fungal sweetness with light rice dessert and alcohol.Thr flavor very closely mirrors the aroma but is not nearly as assertive and very heavy on the alcohol.  Also some woody notes come out in the flavor that were not in the aroma. Very smooth and well balanced. Soft thick body with an alcohol burn throughout. I think the ideal temp for serving would be a bit cooler but ceratinly not too cold as I think that then it would just be numbing.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
3015,"2005-01-29",3.1,"Clear.  Rice and fruit aroma with a grainy alcohol nose.  Buttery smooth and creamy rice and fruit, like bananas, flavor with an alcohol finish.  Palate is slightly watery and creamy with a dry alcohol finish.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
3015,"2005-01-17",2.9,"This being the first sake Ive rated, Im not sure how to go about it. While Ive had a few in the past, I was not made aware of the brand or type. And, this is the first one Ive had that recommended chilling. Well, here goes. Clear in color, slightly more viscous than water with a definite alcohol aroma ... and perhaps a cereal quality to it with a touch of melon or grape. Both the aroma and taste are similar to a dry vermouth ... its a nice, subtle taste, pleasant to sip. I liked it quite a bit.","Cullman, Alabama, USA","RichJ7"
3015,"2005-01-01",2.8,"First drink of 2005... not because it was special, but just because it was in the fridge... Crystal clear sake.  Aroma shows melon and tapioca.  Flavour is fairly hot, alcohol, tapioca/rice. Some melon, tapioca, and rice.   Fairly hot flavour.  A simple sake, but for the price, quite good.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3015,"2004-12-20",3.0,"Another sake style to sample, too bad all the sakes are going to be condensed into one ""sake"" category.  It will make it more difficult to learn more about this beverage.  In any case, clear, just a tad more body than water.  Slight isopropyl aroma.  Flavor had light cucumber and melon notes.  Almost refreshing, and quite smooth, especially given the aroma.  Not bad at all.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
3015,"2004-12-09",2.7,"very mild tasting sake, goes down like water, then the alcohol hits, and you taste everything afterwards. Drank the first bit chilled and then warmed the rest...its cold nights here.. I havent sampled a lot of sakes, but I have been drinking it for 20 years, just dont know what kinds. Are all Namasakes this subtle?","Oakland, California, USA","allphoto"
3015,"2004-11-04",1.5,"My first sake. Aroma is sugar cane, rice, alcohol. Nasty, I dont like sake.  Too alcohol tasting, does have a hint of wine though.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Enniskillen"
3015,"2004-10-05",2.0,"Chilled. Pours just about the color of water. Aroma is like that of a weak wine. Tastes like watery wine with an alcohol kick. Tastes too much like wine for my liking.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
3015,"2004-03-04",2.5,"Smells like a vodka and fruit mixture... very alcoholic, and smells like it would burn, but it doesn't burn at all.  Pretty much flavorless... I prefer the Nigori I had the other day.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3015,"2004-02-22",3.1,"(300ml bottle) Served at a rather chilled 5 Celcius. Viscosity is slightly machine oil consistency. Slight rubbing alcohol in the aroma along with some white wine and that powder that accompanies sticks of bubblegum. Not over-powering flavours and a slight alcohol burn from the 14.5% ABV. Some wood, rice, red grape and chalk. Lacking much flavour but very agreeable!","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
3015,"2004-01-26",3.9,"I'm starting to see the lure of Namasake!  Unlike unpasteurized beer, unpasteurized sake is truly different from its pasteurized cousins and offers something special.  While the Hakutsuru Draft is not comparable to the amazing Ohtouka Nama sake, the Hakutsuru has a candyish aroma (cotton candy) and a mild, light taste that's semi-dry and not buttery or oily in texture.  Very little alcohol burn accompanies the smoothness of this drink.  An inexpensive sake (relatively speaking) that's worth grabbing if you see it.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
3015,"2003-11-30",3.0,"chilled: clear with wierd suspended things hovering..alcohol, white wine, and rice pudding aromas..smooth yet you still know the alcohol is there..white grapes and melon flavors..heats you up..semi-tangy in the finish..kinda dryish but at the same time, a tad sweet.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
