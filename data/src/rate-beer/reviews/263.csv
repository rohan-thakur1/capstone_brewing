Very light straw colored, completely clear. Aroma is slightly sweet, fermented rice, minerals, boozy alcohol (slightly in the direction of thinner), hay, wood. Taste is slightly sweet fruity, minerals, fermented rice, hay, alcohol, wood, licorice, hints of fruits. Slightly watery mouthfeel, mild warming alcohol. Fair enough.","Loddefjord, NORWAY","Inbreak"

263,"2013-05-09",1.6,"350 ml green bottle, from the brewery. ABV is 17%. No carbonation. Clear colour, nearly like water, but with a faint greenish-yellowish hue. The aroma is fairly fruity, also notes of alcohol, marzipan, mushrooms and rice. Sweetish and alcoholic flavour, notes of cheap homemade white wine, mushrooms and some fruit. I do no longer expect ever to grasp the Greater Meaning of sake, and this one brought me no closer to enlightenment.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"
263,"2013-02-25",3.9,"350 ml bottle. Clear, pale straw golden body with no head. The consistence is a bit oily. Mild, subdued complex and really delicate aroma of fruit, especially citric fruit and a hint of something between canned pear and peach. Flavour is delicate as in aroma, relatively strong fruity for sake, acidic like berries, mild gooseberries, mild warming alcohol and a hint of yeast. Fine body and a long, quite refreshing, slightly acidic aftertaste. This is the best sake I have tasted so far. Nice by itself and a perfect match with blue cheese.","Kristiansand, NORWAY","Beer5000"

263,"2012-09-29",3.0,"Stockholm Beer & Whiskey 2012: Mycket torr, men ändå frisk och även vinös på en gång. Lätt men kanske lite tunn i eftersmaken.","SWEDEN","SirLimpsalot"

263,"2011-10-29",3.6,"Bottle. A more or less clear one, some particles suspended in the almost colorless body. Very fruity on the nose, with banana, yellow apples and some apricot. A little alcohol too, but very subdued. Its quite viscous on the palate, a little alchohol burn on the tongue, and that unique almost papery feeling Ive only had in sake I think. It has a flavor that is equally fruity as the aroma, but due to more impact from the alcohol, its not all fruits. Theres a hint of something earthy too, something mushroom like. It lasts for a long time in the mouth, with a pleasant warmth following you for some time. Hmm, seems the Nøgne Ø sakes are getting better and better, at least this ones really nice. 110329","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
