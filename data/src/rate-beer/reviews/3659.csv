 Alkohol:  11,8% obj. 
 IBU:  34 
 Data butelkowania:  14.12.2015 
 Kolor:  Miedziany, wpadający w brązowy. Piwo jest lekko mętne. 
 Piana:  Spory gushing spowodował, że piwo wylewało się strumieniami z butelki.
Piana była lekka, wiotka i niezmiernie szybko pękała do wąskiej koronki.
Miała kolor żółto-kremowy.
Po zakręceniu Tumblerem tylko nieznacznie podnosiła sie do góry.
Na krawędziach punktowe znaczki.
Słabiutko w tej kwestii.
 Zapach:  W aromacie cud, miód, malina i powidło śliwkowe. 
Spore utlenienie w postaci aromatu miodu wielokwiatowego.
Dalej duża porcja karmelu i gorącego toffi.
Jest także mnóstwo odnośników zapachowych do owoców takich jak jabłka i gruszki.
W oddali może nawe kapka mlecznej czekolady. 
 Smak:  W smaku wyraźnie miodowe, potem karmelowe i na końcu owocowe.
Te same owoce co w aromacie (jabłka i gruszki), plus dodatkowo brzoskwinie.
Prócz tego lekkie herbatniki, toffi i muśnięcie czekolady.
Prócz tego cukier trzcinowy i rodzynki.
Oleiste, gęste i dobrze wyważone.
Alkohol rozgrzewający, ale nie dominuje.
Pozostwia w ustach wrażenie nalewki owocowej.
Nieźle pijalne, ale czegoś tutaj brakuje i z pewnością nie jest to jak dla mnie topowe Old Ale... 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Piłem kilka duuużo lepszych Old Ale.
Ta butelka, którą miałem miała spore utlenienie w postaci dużej dawki miodu wielokwiatowego.
Poza tym przywitał mnie konkretny gushing.
Piwo jest dość oleiste, chociaż też nie jest to jakiś mistrzowski poziom.
Alkohol rozgrzewa, ale nie przebija się na zewnątrz. Przy 12% alk. to i tak spory sukces.
Niby wszystko gra, ale w rzeczywistości brakuje mi tutaj balansu.

3659,"2016-05-21",4.0,"355 ml bottle 2016 at abv 11.8% bought at HK Brewcraft in Central.
Looks: Translucent amber brown colour; Less than one-quarter finger head and soapy beige foam which fades in 30 seconds; Fair sticky lacing with barely notable slight carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant Amber malt, with strong Port wine, cellar musty, brett-like barnyard, caramel, toffee, chestnuts, dark fruits, floral, sugar, yeast and grass. Pretty complex!

Taste: Strong, nicely sweet Amber malt, with strong liquor-ish alcohol, liquorices, strong dark fruits, strong assorted yellow fruits, caramel, toffee, vanilla, strong molasses, yeast, lemon, quite strong bitter hops and grass.

Body: Close to full body, Very slick and creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Amber maltyness is strong but not overtly rich. Slick and pretty smooth throughout. Just when you think the booze will taste like the strong Brandy-ish Belgian Ambrée, it is much more restrained as light liquor (hard to pin down a style) with kust the right amount of liquorice. So nice! Ample caramel and toffee with mixes dark fruits and apricot-like yellow fruits. Sweetness is strong but as all molasses and highly enjoyable. Slightly yeasty with nice strong lemon to round. Lovingly subtle and layered!

Booze: Besides the nice light liquor-ish taste, the 11.8% is not aggressive at all, quite well-hidden and not demanding to go down. Excellent!

Hoppiness: Floral and grass in nose. Lemon and grass in taste. Bitterness combined with liquorices comes on an abrupt, mid to high astringent sweet fruity finish.

After Taste: Slightly dry. Nicely sweet and fairly liquorish-bitter to mouth.

Comments: I thought this one could be a Brandy bomb like Bush Ambrée or Bush de Noël, yet the aroma is Port-like with some brett influence, taste is subtle liquor with complex fruity and caramel, very comfy and undemanding booze, and nice hoppiness. Aging it will certainly do more wonders to this tasty Ale. Highly recommended!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

3659,"2016-05-15",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2017 Mixad recension. Tidigare druckit en relativt färsk 2015 (då rate:ad 3,9). Nu även testat 2015 och 2011 jämte varandra, i början på 2017 (den äldre flaskan har passerat bäst före-datum med ett halvår, enligt svensk märkning). De färskare har en mörkröd/mahogny klar ton i färgen, medan den äldre är mer murken mörkbrun, smutsdisig. Från litet vitbeiget skum till knappt något alls. En riktig maltbomb. Stor söt doft av torkad frukt; russin, plommon, johannesbröd, aprikos, övermogna äpplen. Även syltade körsbär, bränt socker, syrlig kola, honung, kandisirap, mörk bröddeg. Med några år på nacken framträder mer brända toner, lite mer ""matt"" sötma och lite ""pappriga"" toner av blöt kartong, ungefär som väntat. Stor, riktigt tung kropp. Oljig. Den äldre var näst intill slät, knappt någon kolsyra kvar. Håller sig nära doften i smaken. I de färskare framträder även en något bitter ton som växer till sig i avslutningen. Annars lite sträva ekfatstoner som bidrar med en lätt syra, lite konjak- och rom-toner och ett lätt humlebett i avslutningen med som är välkommet. Mycket kola, kåda och bränt socker. Alkoholen värmer på ganska bra. Återigen mer ""matta"" malttoner och brända inslag i den äldre flaskan. Håller väl för lagring, men grundölen når ändå inte riktigt upp till toppskiktet.

3659,"2015-11-05",4.4,"12 oz bottle of 2012 edition, poured into a nonic pint at ~40 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a hazy, vaguely reddish brown, and forms a thin head of beige foam that rather quickly turns into a ring. Leaves patches of lacing on the glass.

Smell: At 3 years of age, the aroma is a bouquet of sweetness and malt, very caramel and molasses. Fig, plum, date, and the like swirl around in the scent as well, alongside a vague hint of booziness that seems less rum, more whiskey.

Taste: All the sweetness in the nose did not lie. This opens in a wash of dark stone fruit preserves slathered on bread and topped with molasses. A medicinal quality comes in as the beer moves along the palate, much like Id imagine an early 19th-century cough syrup might have tasted like. Rusted iron notes appear as well, giving a metallic tang to shadow the syrupy sweetness, and there are bits of a burnt caramel-vanilla tone. An oaky and vinous tinge round out the flavor palate, and the aftertaste lingers as the molasses, preserves, and medicinal syrup.

Mouthfeel: Sticky is the first word that comes to mind, with minimal sharpness from carbonation rolling through a full-bodied beer.

Overall: A delicious old ale / English barleywine, which ages quite well.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

3659,"2015-10-14",4.7,"North Coast ships its hops from England when brewing its annual batch of Old Stock Ale, which shows its dedication to crafting an English Style Ale. However, its the use of said hops that creates a uniquely American ale. Old Stock has a fair amount of earthy bitterness mixed in with the rich grains. Before I get too far down that trail, Old Stock pours ruby red with a thin layer of foam - not surprising given the ABV being just shy of 12%. Aroma has dark and syrupy fruits. Flavor has bread, fig, date, plum, prune, cherry, toffee, butterscotch, and mild citrus. The full-bodied mouthfeel contains stickiness and some crispness coming from the hops. Old Stock has some serious class. Id love to try a version with even more age than the 2014 vintage.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

More barley sugars, honey, apple syrup and vinsanto sweetness manage to remain dry but very literal: astounding for a nearly 12% beer how easy to drink, yet how literal and under-complex this beer remains, lessening the appeal to take repeated sips. Candied citrus, pine, pear drops come through to make clear this is a doublehopped US barleywine. Hides its booziness well, but does not offer a need to indulge in its rich caramels.

Soft sweet malty body, just a bit of caramel and toffee, but not sticky or sugary sweet. Retronasals are lovely, has that tempting cakey caramel. Finish beatifully roasty, a darker caramel than the taste. Covers the alcohol brilliantly, and doesnt just smother it with sugar.

This was poured into a snifter.
The appearance was a nice looking dark brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a decent forty-five seconds. A nice trickling yet speckled lacing clung but ended up sliding into the beer.
The smell had a nice sweet to malty cinnamon and raisinous sticky slightly maple-esque conglomeration.
The taste, for the most part copied the smell and added a nice coating of a sticky sweet cinnamon and maple and a nice dark fruit (sweet plums).
The palate sat about a good medium on the body with a nice sessionability running under my tongue delicately yet smoo.

A - Pours nut brown with a very spotty tan head leaving no lacing down the glass.

3659,"2014-09-05",4.3,"2014 vintage. Clear heavy amber pour with a huge dark ruby cast making it almost red. Good head, lacing and retention. The nose is dark fruits (plum, raisin and fig) over a faint caramel sweetness with moderate alcohol notes. Full bodied with a rich creamy texture. Average carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is loaded with complexity, yet well balanced. The 11.8% alcohol is very well hidden, but becomes more prevalent as it warms. It begins with a burst of caramel sweetness that flows into the dark fruit flavors, but the sweetness is never absent due to the heavy malt bill. Chocolate notes appear in the middle that relent to coffee/toffee notes. The finish is where the alcohol is most prevalent, leaving you with that nice alcohol burn at the back of the throat, but yet not overpowering. The finish is somewhat tannic with a touch of hops over a fading caramel sweetness. An outstanding Old Ale and a fine example of OCs brewing prowess.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

3659,"2014-08-29",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 2-28-13-
 Served on tap in a snifter glass

 Appearance  Served a mahogany colored brew with a one finger cream colored head. The head faded rather fast giving way to a persistent foam and a great level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is sweet with a heavy toffee and caramel smell. Mixed with this aroma are smells of a dark fruit, roasted malt and a bit of nuttiness and vanilla. A bit of a boozy, rum like aroma accompanies all these creating a quite complex and warming smell.

 Taste  The taste begins with sweet flavors o toffee and caramel mixed with some roasted malt flavors. A light dark fruit flavor of cherry then enters the taste as well as a little bit of vanilla. Soon after these tastes hit the taste buds so too dose a mild oaky and nutty like flavor. Toward the middle to the end the booziness that was hinted at in the nose becomes known. In the end the now nicely warming and boozy flavor of the brew, when mixed with the sweet and roasted flavors leaves a rather sweet and toasty flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfell  The body of the beer is a little on the thinner side for a 11.9 % brew(but thick if comparing to an average brew) with a carbonation level that is on the medium to slightly higher side. A little less carbonation and more creaminess may have better suited the boozy and sweet flavors of the brew keeping it, as is more appropriate, as a sipping beer.

 Overall- A rather tasty and slightly boozy brew. The only thing really holding it back from greatness is the weak body, but otherwise it is quite fantastic.","","Darkmagus82"

A pleasant bitterness on the finish with a touch of oxidation. This is a big beer and it takes time to sort it out. Thick mouthfeel with a long long finish. Overall, nothing to complain about. It doesnt feel like there are a lot of silly spice additions to detract from the wonderful malt and the rich gravity of this beer. I have come to expect a lot from North Coast.

3659,"2014-03-01",3.5,"2013 bottling.
Appearance: The body is a mildly murky amber to garnet with a dense light tan head. The head quickly forms a dense coating.
Aroma: The aroma leans a little fruity with hints of oak, odd since it snot oak aged. Earthy tones poke through the fruitiness along with a dash of caramel. The aroma smells okay, but isnt very aromatic.
Taste: The flavor is big and malty with subtle fruity esters. Big brown sugar and molasses along with caramel make a big malt base with a slight spiciness overlying with fig. Big and easy to drink, this only hints at alcohol on the finish.
Palate: Full-bodied, near thick, with light carbonation.
Overall: Despite my rating, I have a lot of respect for this beer. Its one of the few beers Id ever want to age a bunch of while still tasting good fresh. This could certainly use a few months in the cellar, but it drinks nicely now.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Maybe one should simply buy and age as the beer is better with just a year on it. 

Note to NC: release beer when ready, no sooner. 

Vintage 2010, Reviewed 22MAR11
A: Pours a beautiful mahogany ale with hues of cherry red. Single finger head of roasted peanut dissipates in a couple minutes and leaves a thin sheet of the same. Spotty lacing. Brilliant clarity.
S: Initially, alcohol comes out punching! Then I get the tones of vanilla, malt, cherries (maraschino), light soapy smell (not bad, but different). Good nose, will be better with age I bet.
T: Mmmm. Toffee, light noble hops, cascade resin and citrus are subdued, yet present. Alcohol is slightly sweet, but not in any way offensive. Hint of cornbread. Again, maraschino cherries. Nice. The toffee keeps teasing me, more time = more toffee = more happy!
M: Full bodied and medium carbonation. Dries the mouth and forces my tongue to push for resonating flavors. Nice.
O: Excellent crafsmanship. Good old ale. The profile compels me to keep a dozen in the cellar for a year or two. Should become more tawny in character. Pretty stoked about the potential here. 4/4/4/4/4-4

3659,"2013-12-07",3.7,"Bottle, 2012 vintage. Pours an auburn brown with a small, yellowish-brown head. Aroma is caramel, a bit boozy. Toffee, light breadiness. Taste is a lot of caramel as well. Some syrupiness, dried dark fruit. A bit boozy as it warms up. Full and carbonated. Not too complex, but a nice sipper.","Alabama, USA","Erasmus_ro"
3659,"2013-12-07",4.0,"Bottle from Akkurat. Thanks to a bloke in the pub. It pours a brown colour with a small off white head. Aroma is bready, caramel, dark fruit, alcohol, touch of spice and vanilla. Taste is similar with caramel up front, alcohol and dark fruit, then finishes with some bitterness and dry. Relatively smooth and medium bodied. Very good indeed.","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"
3659,"2013-12-06",3.8,"2010 and 2011 12oz bottles side by side.
Aroma on both have a similar malt character with toasted bread, caramel, and toffee. Some fig and raisin notes. The 2010 has almost not hop character and shows a bit of oxidation with some honey and wet paper. The 2011 is definitely brighter with some citrus and resin hop notes and doesnt seem to have much oxidation. 2011 wins on aroma.
They both pour a slightly murky copper amber with a tan head. The 2011 had more head and it was thicker. Both receded quickly to the edges. Light lacing and faint legs. 2011 wins on appearance.
The flavor is a bit different between the two. The 2010 has a much smoother flavor with well integrated malt and fruit components. Lots of toasted bread, caramel and toffee with raisin and fig notes. Light prune notes as well but not much hop character. Medium bitterness and light alcohol note in the finish. The 2011 flavor is a bit rougher on the edges but is also brighter and fresher. Caramel, toasted bread and toffee again dominate. Lesser, but similar in character, fruit notes than the 2010. More hop bitterness and a bit of hop flavor still intact. More alcohol spice in the finish. 2010 wins for flavor.
2011 is medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 2010 is similar but with medium low to low carbonation. I think I like the lower carbonation as it had less carbonic bite. 2010 wins on mouthfeel.
Overall they are fairly similar but the difference of a year is noticeable. The year really hurt the aroma of the 2010, but I think it did a lot to smooth out the flavor. I actually dont like the contribution of the hops to the flavor, but found it helped with the aroma.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Poured from a cellared 12 ounce bottle into a Spiegelau tulip, with MUCH anticipation! 

A: HUGE wine smell, I get plum notes, some toffee notes and a slight alcohol burn.
A: Pours a cloudy, almost opaque walnut-hue with very little head and no lacing. Murky is the word here. 
T: WOW! Incredible, other-worldly complex beer. Intense flavors cascading on the palate like a Greek dinner in a family restaurant on Crete. Strong merlot flavors keep surfacing, but the overall smoothness dominates. 
P: Medium body with extremely mild carbonation.. Silky, mildly astringent. The finish is moderately dry. 
O: Without a doubt, the SMOOTHEST barley wine Ive ever had! I was scared to drink a 10 year old beer, and the pour was so murky it only heightened the anxiety. The first taste quelled all fears and I was instantly struck by how smooth and refined the taste was, despite its overwhelming complexity.

Quite a bit of licorice up front, both sweet red & deep black, hefty raisin & date notes, lathered in sweet caramel sauce & smooth whiskey.

The 2013 vintage is complex and layered, offering a multitude of eloquent characteristics

A clear, vibrant, dark cherry body displays fiery vermillion and amber highlights with a two inch off white-light khaki head dissipating to a very thin, yet complete ring and a few medium to small, translucent, delicate islands

Spiced dark cherry, licorice, plumb, prune, orange, and fig esters mingle with mellow milk chocolate, coffee cake, cream, and dark wood on a medium, well carbonated body which rolls into a silky, frothy cream texture; flavors resonating and concentrating to a lightly alcoholic, cherry and horehound finish with medicinal flairs expressing a building, soft warmth as the quaff exits the harbor

2011 is further refined and integrated demonstrating flowing, restrained confidence

Color has grown a step deeper offering a smaller, more delicate and loosely structured head which completely dissipates

Characteristics of the 2013 vintage have married and condensed into bourbon soaked fruit cake bringing candied, toasted barrel and moist leather to mind; carbonation has dissipated, allowing the palate to mature into a silky smooth texture with medium heft; alcohol notes have become a proponent of the ales rich dynamics, further accompanying and accentuating the spectrum of rich, aristocratic aromas and flavors

3659,"2013-01-22",4.1,"Reviewed 12/29/2012.12 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a very dark brown color with low clarity and even a bit of opacity. The head is impressive for damn near 12% - a one finger light mocha color with a pretty texture and excellent retention for the gravity. Good lacing, too.

S: Very forward in sweet caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, and molasses. The booze that comes through almost has a bourbon character to it which I find to be very pleasing.

T: Wow, this is sweet, just as I expected. The usual suspects - brown sugar, caramel, molasses, chocolate, and toffee - all appear vibrant on the initial taste. I can notice earthen malts/hops and a more expressive note of vinous sourness on the midtaste, which not only dries out the huge sweetness, but does a good job, too. Finish is a hybrid of dark fruits, vanilla, leather and bourbon-esque booziness, though every so often it will shift from being like bourbon to being port-like (less vanilla and more raisin and grape). With a bit more tannin presence, this could almost pass for a BA brew at times. Overall complexity is subtle instead of forceful; the latter could have just as easily killed this one, and Im glad it didnt. Not super drinkable, but wonderful to savor.

M: I think the carbonation could be a little less forceful (not necessarily weaker, though) This is actually fairly clean and dry at first, but becomes a little more oily and lingering after a few sips. A bit airy and insubstantial; its not as decadent as I would have liked, and doesnt quite do the flavor profile justice. Still, this is less harsh than it could have been - but I think a year in the cellar would do it wonders.

O: Better than I expected. Its actually pretty damn drinkable right now! If the mouthfeel was beefed up some, this really could have been something unbelievable. As it stands, its still an excellent old ale. Seemingly lacking in frills, it instead chooses to sneak up on the palate with a wonderful - if not readily apparent at first - depth of flavor and complexity.

3659,"2012-12-26",3.7,"(2011 vintage) Garnet-colored beverage topped by a rapidly disappearing off-white/yellow-ish head. What remains is you, a tiny ring of foam and that red brew that you anxiously smell. Brown sugar, treacle (someone mentionned toffee but I couldnt feel it)  is what strikes you first. And then you still search and you find some alcoholic notes and nothing else... bummer. Carbonation is a little higher than Id like but it doesnt bother me that much, really as it makes the mouth feel bigger (ample). Taste is again brown sugar without a discernible bitterness. What you can feel though is all the alcohol warmth and sting. I thought it would be more complex than it is but it is still a good, big barleywine.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
3659,"2012-12-25",4.2,"2012 vintage, 12 oz. bottle, poured into a nonic glass. 

It pours a dark red with minimal tan lacing. The first sniff gives carmel, oak, and some toasted malts. The flavor brings out heavy, fruity hops, balanced by the smoky malts. 

I tried this beer when it was released about a year ago and they aren't kidding about it aging well. Initially it was a pruny, boozy and overly sweet beer, but a year of storage has enhanced some smokey flavors and made it a well balanced and enjoyable brew.","California, USA","lukemundy"

3659,"2012-12-15",4.0,"2012 vintage, 12 oz bottle, Whole Foods Columbus.  Deep red-brown; initially a 1-finger off-white frothy, rocky head that completely disappears fairly quickly.  Smells like a huge beer; big and malty, sweet, brown sugar, a little dark fruit, and noticeable alcohol.  Flavor is quite strong and heavy, malt, nut, and theres a serious level of alcohol in the finish and exhale.  Thick mouthfeel but the carbonation disappears fairly quickly which is a little bit of an issue because this is a sipping beer and will probably take some time to drink.  This is a nice beer, and while I only bought the single, I could definitely see picking up a 4-pack and hanging on to it for a few years because I would expect this to mellow very nicely.

Bit of acetic acid maybe, with some bitterness and dryness in the aftertaste. I agree with the other reviews - ""Spicy"" is a good descriptor. The alcohol is totally here to stay. It dominates the mouthfeel on this one. Carbonation is pleasant. That ethanol dryness and the numbness hits quickly, though. Overall, decent but the alcohol is way too up-front.

The palate is incredibly thick, sticky, and resinous. One of the most ""rich"" beers that Ive ever had. Lots of dense, powerful, unforgiving flavors all packed together.

The beer is dark ruby hued, with a thin, wispy tan head that leaves faint lacing on the snifter. The aroma brings malt, toffee, alcohol.

3659,"2012-05-27",3.6,"This bottle is one of two I purchased from the 2011 vintage. I drank this from a tulip glass.

The first pour results in a gorgeous deep amber with a light head that bubbles fast and dissipates quickly. Mild Lacing is observed and noticeable bubbling.

The Odor offers up smells of whiskey, apple and other fruits I cant put my finger on. The mild smell is surprising, maybe she needs to warm a bit. As I go back I smell cherries and figs. More smells reveal caramel and toffee, this is one complex beast.

That first sip is so smooth that I could swear this beer isnt 12% ABV I get tastes of whiskey, caramel, toffee, apple, cherries, fig. Everything comes together and lays so well.

Bold on the tongue, it chooses to stick to the back of the mouth rather than the front. The carbonation helps mask how thick the beer is.

3659,"2012-05-22",3.8,"So... Im a day away from not being able to have a beer for three or more weeks as Ana and I are about to embark on macrobiotic diets.  As ludicrous as it may seem, I actually feel more sorrow for my loss of cheese more than my loss of beer.  As a last hoorah, I bought a block of white Stilton with cranberry and dates, figs, apple slices, sharp cheddar, and figs... and a few bottles of North Coast Old Stock Ale.  What a better way to enjoy Stilton, yeah?

No aging (2012 vintage): Its immediately noticeable that this beer is pretty immature right off the shelves.  The beer is a mostly clear, dark plum-like color with a healthy, yet fast-fading off-white head that leaves dense, fast-falling lace.  It looks incredibly clean.

North Coast Old Stock Ale
    North Coast Old Stock Ale

It smells a little dirty (as in dirt-like, not filthy), with an almost woody, earthy, hay-like intensity thats slightly softened by a light fruit aroma.  Theres no doubt that this harsh aroma will age incredibly well.

In the mouth, its pretty darned pungent.  Strong alcohol couples with bitter, flavorful hops to stoke this thin-bodied (yet full) brews fire.  This beer must be enjoyed at (Im guessing) about 60 degrees to allow all of its characteristics to fill the beer, as a cold glass of this will taste more like vodka than a barley wine.   Theres an almost stain-like darkness in the flavor that reminds me a little of a combination of molasses and ink.  As odd as that sounds, it tastes very nice.  Strong, but respectable.

This definitely needs to age at least two years (Im predicting three or four at this point) in order for it to fully shine.  Having had many vertical tastings in my life, Ive come to recognize aging potential in a beer... and this is showing all the signs of a good cellar candidate.

My advice: dont drink this fresh.  If you can find a vintage a couple years old or can hold yourself back from drinking a bottle of it for a few years, jump on it!","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Smells bright, new fruit with pear and apple most apparent. Under that is malt. Quite pleasant. 

Taste like alcohol, caramel and malty sweetness. The taste lingers in the mouth for awhile afterward. Almost like the beer version of port.

Syrupy and fairly carbonated. It is heavy on the tongue.

For its style it is good. One bottle is plenty to enjoy for awhile. I have a few more of these that are going to sit in storage for a few years, maybe even a decade. Im excited to see how time changes it.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"

3659,"2012-03-01",3.8,"2009 vintage (11.5%) poured from a 12oz bottle to a brandy snifter.  Smell bursts from the bottle.  Lots of sweet darkness - toffee, caramel, milk chocolate.  Theres some other subtle nuances that Im struggling to pin down.  Touch of booze.  It pours a murky dark burgundy with a slim tan cap that fades quickly.  The taste is roughly 95% malts at this point.  Big burnt caramel and a tiny touch of oxidation that keeps things interesting.  Finishes off a bit nutty, no real detectable booze in the aftertaste.

3659,"2012-02-07",3.9,"12 oz bottle. Pours a translucent roan brown color with a small beige head that fizzes and rapidly dissipates. The aroma is moderate in strength with toffee, malts and dark breads. The taste is malts forward with toffee, caramel, colas and lots of nutty sensations; walnuts, pecans and filberts. Additionally, in the tasting, there is a lightly spicy hop presence, much brown sugar sweetness and a good dose of hot alcohol. The palate is silky smooth with carbonation that is lively and prickly.

Taste different, like sweet malts, brown sugar and a hint of vanilla. Texture is a little oily, and the after taste is drawn out with warming from the alcohol and a touch of sweetness. This is not overly sweet, and the alcohol is not overly present for my taste. Although, those two things are what seem to define this ale.

This falls in line with North Coasts nack for providing solid ""everyday big beers"" This beer does get better with age, and I personal like it best with 3 plus years. I rated the palate a bit low because I find until it hits about 3 years I find this beer ""feels"" over carbonated although it really isnt. Its just a mouth feel issue for me I suppose. Its a great find on the shelves if you happen across a couple year old bottles wearing a nice coating of dust. This beer ages just fine on a stockroom shelf.

3659,"2011-08-29",3.7,"2009 Version from bottle.  Aroma:  Heavy malt, roasted caramel, light grassy hop
Palate:  Viscous, smooth
Flavor:  Rich caramel malt attack with overripe orange and peach, and orange rind on the mid-palate.  Finishes with yeast, caramel and a dash of pepper-like spice (orange rind?).
Comment:  Not as good as the earlier vintages (or possibly my palate is moving away from this style).  It was pretty simple when first opened but 24 hours in the fridge brought out the fruit character.  This has enough weight that giving it a bit of air and time may benefit it.","Kobe, JAPAN","Wombata"

OK, that might be a bit harsh, theres also notes of liquorice and chocolate, in fact it reminds me a lot of a milk chocolate coated sweet liquorice candy that is somewhat of a personal favourite. The taste is wondrously complex registering all over the tongue. Compared to when I had it a year ago, Id say some of the alcohol sweetness has worn of leaving more space for the other flavours to shine through.

3659,"2011-08-12",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2013 2011 vintage. A great barley wine, indeed. Pours a beautiful slightly hazy reddish brown with a minimal tan head. Moving it around in front of a lamp shows a multitude of different nuances to the color. Great stuff. Aroma is rich - bready malts, dark fruits, caramel, cherry (which subsides a bit the warmer it gets), port-like alcohol. Taste is incredible complex, starting off with a  slight malty sweetness that then turns into a very nicely balanced bitterness - the only time the hops really come through - before ending in a very long sweet and round finish. It lasts forever! Body is surprisingly light yet still rich and full with a low but clearly present level of carbonation. This is a winner. Im picking up a few more for aging, for sure!

EDIT: I have since done 2012 and now 2013. 2013 in particular is sweeter both in aroma (butterscotch) and taste (butterscotch, maple syrup). Body is also fuller and richer, incredibly creamy. I wish there was an option to rate this per year as it does change quite dramatically. Rating reflects my opinion of the 2013 vintage.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Ktwse"

3659,"2011-03-22",3.8,"0.33l 2009-bottle. Pours a deep red body with a thin bubbly side-sticking almost yellow-beige head. Aroma is lovely caramel sweet, hops, smoke and brown sugar. Medium-bodied and medium+ carbonated. Quite boozy at first, caramel- and brown sugar-sweet with a slight floral note. There is something about barlywines that normally is too sweet for me, and this was sweet, just not as sweet as i first would have thought. It also had a strong bitterness that equalized the sweetness. That combined with the warming alcohol made this a pleasant experience.","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"
3659,"2011-03-21",1.8,"12 oz bottle, 2010 vintage.

It pours a beautiful, dark, deep red with a big white head that quickly dissipates with no lacing.

It is fruity in the aroma with a predominance of raisins. There is some caramel and sugar scents as well.

The flavor is pretty sweet. It tastes like raisins and oxidized fruits. It isnt the most pleasant flavor, it is rather pungent and cloying.

Despite being a year old it still seems hot with alcohol.

I have had a lot of great barleywines/old ales lately and this one fell on its face in comparison.

3659,"2011-02-25",3.1,"12 oz bottle (2010 vintage). This is a boozy, syrupy English style barley wine that could really use some rounding and mellowing out. The pour was exceptionally fizzy with a small bubbled blank white head, and a very translucent body for such a strong beer. However, its mysterious honey-crimson color make it fairly intriguing. In fact, honey and oat, English cereal malts make the biggest impact in the nose aside from the thick mixed mild fruit esters. Also, molasses, dates, and maple syrup sweetness. All of this is fairly muddled, which for a hazy, whiskey-like nose in actuality. The body is hot, highly carbonated, and syrupy at the same time. This is not exactly to my liking. Fruit, molasses, honey, and oatmeal clump together in the beginning. This only makes way for more mild fruits, grainy whiskey malts, and potpourri hops which balance but do little to bring everything together. The finish is also balanced, yet hot. Some uniqueness and complexity save this one to an extent, but the truth is that youd be better served letting this one sit for a long while. Not quite there for me.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"

This beer appeared a gorgeous deep, dark maroon/brown, but had the most fizzy, soda-pop like head I have seen in a long time - that just didnt do it for me. Smells of raisin, sweet wheat and dark fruit, specifically dates. The taste follows, with a nice raisin sweet start, a malty dark fruit/date middle, and some booze heat to finish. The heat is well done, with just enough to get the job done. I also got a hint of vanilla near the end which was quite pleasant; it wasnt much, but it was there. Mouthfeel is good, with the carbonation helping to bring out the vanilla in particular. Syrupy coating after a swallow nice as well, to go with the sticky texture. Drinkability is pretty good for an 11% abv beer, but the tastes can become a jumble after a bit. One single of this guy is the right amount.","California, USA","madvermin"

The brew itself is a gorgeously deep brown. The taste malty and pleasant, but like a bomb going off, I received the most harsh sourness just after the first swig. I was certain that I had happened upon a bad bottle, but taking another, the sourness was not there. It did not appear again until much further into the bottle, and then much less severe. At the bottom of the bottle, the sourness was not to be found. I am certain that the sourness was an anomaly. Silky smooth on the palate, the carbonization is not strong. Overall, an enjoyable ale save for the random attack of sourness that I hope will not be in the next bottle I am sure to have.","Villa Park, Illinois, USA","Wolfenkopf"
3659,"2011-01-29",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2011 2010 vin 12oz bottle.  Pencil-thin, fresh, sandy head soon dissolves to a speck or two of foam.  Its an inviting amber color, though murky, but prettily translucent: a lot like looking though a gem, actually.  The taste surprised me because it is a pale blend, but it is a perfect one for my preference of stout.  While the ABV 11.7% - 30% more than the same brewers Imperial Russian Stout, Old Rasputin - subdues the nose to almost nothing (no - no boozy knee-jerk), the most prevalent aroma is coffee / toffee.  This beer forgoes the oil of Old Rasputin for alcohol but sacrifices nothing to satisfying the palate.  At this proof, this beer is made for sipping.  But each sip is for savoring.

How: Bottle 12oz.  Consumed when about 2 year of age to compare with the two the Bas version of similar age
The look: Cloudy light purple-brown body topped by a beige ring of foam.  Lighter in color than both BA versions I had side-by-side with this one.
In long: The sweet nose is really a raisin pie.  I dont know if Ive ever had a beer that smelled so much like a raisin pie.  Taste is purely and simply a crusty raisin pie covered with caramel and butterscotch.  I dont know what else I can add to this simple description.  Finish has a strong alcohol bite with some fusel/metallic notes that prevented it from being more than just an excellent beer.

A brew of  considerable flavour and finesse, easily a match for any English barley wine Ive tasted.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

G: Poured into a snifter.

A: Pours a dark caramel/toffee with a thin light cream-colored head. Almost entirely opaque with some carbonation.

S: Smells of toffee and caramel. Rich malt base. Still fairly hot in terms of alcohol. 

T: Definitely still fairly hot. This is my first of these, and even with a year on it you can definitely taste the 12.5 abv. 

M: Medium to full body with a smooth creaminess. Definitely large alcohol notes; this is still quite hot, although still good. This is a beer that could definitely use quite a bit of time more in the cellar. 

D: Again, still a little hot. Still, quite nice. Im hoping that some time in the cellar will help the complexities in this one come out a little bit more.

Immidiately struck by the contrast with the Great Divide Hibernation Ale I had last night; this one smells much more like Id expect an old ale/barleywine to smell.  Deeply copper/ruby, moderate head and very active carbonation, but light on the lacing.  Nose bursts with dark fruits, dates, raisins, LOTS of cherry, sweet rich malts and only a hint of alcohol.  Solid sweetness is followed by nice palate-cleansing bittering mixed with a significant hotness.  This thing is quite a warm sucker, but its not horribly so.  It doesnt drink as smooth as a Fourth Dementia, but what does?  I guess this is technically more towards the barley wine side of things, so with that in mind comparing it to Fourth Dementia might not be appropriate. This is a solid beer fresh and I can see this getting really great with a couple years on it.  Time to build a vertical...","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","RyanMM"

Both have a deep amber liquid with a small, fast dissipating off-white head. 2010 is a bit hazy while 2011 is clear. Aroma wise they both have notes of dried fruit, whereas the 2011 is more caramely and somewhat boozy and the 2010 is more complex, deeper and also feels a bit oxidated (notes of port). Taste wise both are light to medium sweet (2011 is a bit sweeter) and light to medium bitter. 2010 is deeper and more complex, less booze. Once again, 2011 shows more caramel and 2010 a bit port and more dried fruit. 2010 is has a fuller body than 2011, both about medium to full bodied. 2011 has higher carbonation (about medium level), 2010 isnt flat but not spritzy at all.

Appearance : Deep amber tiny head that goes away fast.

Aroma : Liquorice, some raisins. Lots of molasses. Very sweet. There is something else that I cant put the word on. Lots of toffee. Smells more like a scotch ale so far. Some alcohol.

Overall : Reminds me a bit of Brother Thelonious which I didnt cared for too much. This one is better though. Too much spicy/liquorice with a bit too much alcohol.

The flavor is malt dominated and has a bit of everything including rum cake, overly ripe plums, dates, caramel, brown sugar and a hint of raisin.  Hops are subtle and used nicely to give just enough bitter kick to balance out all the malt flavors.  Beautiful texture to this one that is slightly syrupy and viscous like every respectable barleywine should be.  Finish is slightly fizzy and faintly warming.  The 12.5% ABV is essentially imperceptible.  Simply put Old Stock is the chronic and a must for every beer cellar.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"

Rated May 20, 2010  2008 Bottle Pours a beautiful cloudy mahogany with a small, frothy, beige head. The aroma is huge!!! Lots of caramel with dark fruit, candied sugar, and a bit of anise. I cant believe how well hidden the alcohol is. The flavor is similar, very full and rich, yet mellow and well blended. This is an amazing barley wine. A little sweet on the finish. Soft, surprisingly light mouthfeel with slightly fizzy carbonation. Awesome!

Rated January 5, 2011  2009 bottle. Clear ruby-copper with a small to nil head. The aroma has dark fruit, caramel, and alcohol. The flavor is similar and well balanced, but much more boozy than the 08 vintage was which is surprising since it has a lower abv. Soft, smooth body with minimal carbonation but still pretty warm. Maybe another year of aging will mellow this out. I guess time will tell.","Joliet, Illinois, USA","monkeychugg55"

3659,"2010-05-15",4.1,"2008 handbottle, turned into what I call ""REALLY Old Stock Ale"" by cellaring for over a year.  Pours a reddish brown with a thin, dense, but short-lived off-white head.  Aroma is a sweet mix of raisin bread, caramel, and maybe some hints of licorice.  Flavor follows this pattern, but the caramel feels thick, as if it were coating a candy apple.  Amazingly, this somehow isnt cloying.  The abundance of malt backbone and booze with the high ABV chews through the sugars and makes a very nice complex blend of flavors. Texture is syrupy from years in the bottle, but this is a darn good barleywine.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","bblack99"

3659,"2010-05-09",4.1,"The Old Stock Ale from North Coast Brewing was one of the first old ales/Barleywines that I tasted back in my early beer geek days. Now each years release is one I look forward to from pretty much the start of the New Year. Along with drinking a few bottles fresh, I always make sure to stash a couple three away for aging. Truly, the Old Stock Ale will do just fine with an easy five or six years under her cap, when stored properly, of course. In the meantime, I am going to enjoy a fresh bottle of the 2009 release.


Old Stock Ale not only tastes great, it also looks great. I am always enamored by his deep polished mahogany hues matched by an equally coppery sheen to his head. A rich beast of a brew, his head never lingers long, choosing instead to decorate my glass with a tight copper necklace from start to finish. Swirls produce no lace, but Im not surprised. This is a sipping brew if there ever were one, and I am more than ready to take my sweet loving time with him. First, lets start with the nose; sweet, spiced, and boozy. The booze hits hard yet gentle in the back of my nose with each rapid sniff, while candy apples and freshly sliced red apples delight. There may have been no barrels involved in the brewing of this beer, but the wonderfully rich, spiced, sweet, and woody esters of aged rum are ever present along with fresh cinnamon sticks. Take the cinnamon sticks, add apples, blend, and tada! Spiced applesauce. Black grapes, canned nectarines, red licorice, maple and pecan praline all clamor for my attentions. As I revel in all his nose has to offer, the crisp snap of peach skins bring me back to reality just in time for my first quaff. Full, rich, heavy, and mouthcoating, just the way I like my Old Stock Ale. Instantly my cheeks are rosy, my chest aglow, and my breath spiced with cinnamon, rum, and wood. Candy apples crunch and stick to my teeth while the caramel coats my lips with each quaff. Pears, peaches, and apples are steeped in booze and rummy spices, their flavors melting atop my tongue in an orgy to shame the most decadent red light district. Slowly the top of my tongue begins to dry just a wee bit, the main culprit being an essence of boozed wood and brown spices. Red licorice sticks, my least favorite candy treat, greets me from the middle of his palate and I find that, just this once and only in this manner, do I enjoy that particular flavor profile. Treacle and caramelized pecans add their own sweet nuttiness. Each slow sup is a pleasant mix of all the above, and seeing as I have nowhere in particular to go, I set my pen down and savor the rest of our time together.


Each release of Old Stock Ale is a rebirth of a classic. Slowly but surely I am building an epic vertical of anywhere from five to ten years of Old Stock. Seeing as I only have 2008 and 2009, itll be a while before you read about that particular journey of mine. In the meantime, grab a couple 4packs, a snifter, a chair, and enjoy.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Pours with surprisingly decent carbonation and a modest crown atop a burnt orange liquid.  Aroma is strong boozy raisins and you can tell its going to be a monster.  The taste is a complex mesh of caramels, sweet raisins, occasionally even chocolate, but perhaps most dominant is a brown sugar note reminiscent of Southern Comfort.  Needs some aging to simmer down, but I think this beer is probably incredible with some time on it.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"

Flavor of caramel malts, resin, berry fruits, tropical fruits, floral notes, vanilla, wood, citrus, hops, and alcohol.  Complex.  Bitter and boozy, with some balancing sweetness.

Old Stock Ale is very bitter, from start to finish, which was a little too much for me as it accompanied by a underlaying current of hot, boozy spiciness.

2009. clear pour... deep auburn brown with an orange hued tannish head. huge aggressive bubbles from the carbonation. 

aromas of spiciness, malt, over ripe plums,  a little dust, herbs, flowery hops and a bit of smoky wood. it is really crisp and spicy compared o the smooth richness of the 2004.

the palate lacks the sweetness of the 2004... yay! but also lacks the complexity... boo. flavors noted... plummy jammy goodness, nuts, cookie dough, smoky wood, a little peat-like earthiness, calcium, herbals, brown sugar and a touch of tartness on an otherwise smooth finish. alcohol is slight and pleasantly warming.

the body is medium... surprisingly. though it feels thinner than the 2004. it is crisp and prickly yet the carbonation is low. a slight chalkiness is noticed in the mouth feel. 7.5/4/7/4/16/3.85

2004 11.4% pours out milky, thick and sludgey... opaque rusty colored mix of auburn and cherry juice. teenie-tiny bubbles of carbonation. loads of yeasty gunk is left in the bottle. 

it smells really sweet and malty compared to the fresh version... lots of sherry oxidation, vanilla, brown sugar, dates, maple, sticky fig newton cookies and waffle batter. the oxidation reminds me of burgundy grand cru whites with 25+ years on them!

the flavor is seemingly sweeter... at least more malt forward than the 2004. ideally, it is too sweet but complexity makes up for it.... notes of brown sugar, chocolate chip cookies, golden raisin-like tartness, vanilla, wood, cinnamon and a bitter grain husk quality on the finish. it is spicy, prickly and tingly yet full bodied, thick and syrupy. it approaches cloying but never makes it there. it has a smooth texture with low carbonation and a chalky mouth feel. warmth from alcohol and spice is pleasant. 8.5/5/8/4/16/4.15

Some herbal citrus hops help dry this with a light bitterness. Alcohol comes out in the end as well, but doesnt offend. Sweeter aftertaste that lingers for a long duration. Full body, somewhat sticky and syrupy, smooth and mouth coating, and warming with a very light carbonation. Overall, a very nice barley wine. Lots of malts and plenty of complexity. A tasty, warming sipper.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
3659,"2010-01-21",3.9,"Bottle (in NZ). It has taken me a while to try and decide whether this distinguished itself as a Barley Wine. I had a lot of time to ponder too, as its a big beer! Touches of marmite and soy sauce on the sweet medicinal nose. Big juicy, syrupy palate. Sticky molasses, but offset by plenty of heat from the alcohol.  And raisins off course. But its those hints of hops that creep through that take this to another level.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","TheGrandMaster"

By my palette, quite fruity, smacking of apple juice. Some nice, low-key paleness. Medium to big in body with mild carbonation. High ABV give the beer a nice, warming character. Definitely a beer to be sipped and savored.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
3659,"2010-01-18",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 11, 2010 2007 vintage.  Ive been aging a few different vintages of Old Stock Ale and I think that 2007 is one of the best.  Nice dirty brown color with low carbonation.  The fullness of this beer fills your mouth from the first sip.  Butterscotch, toasted wood, and nice grainy malt taste in the background (even though this is aged *and* sweet!).  The hop bitterness is in perfect balance with the sweet malt.  At 11.7% ABV, this is a dangerous beer as it goes down more smoothly than other less balanced beers with much less alcohol in them.

2010 vintage:  Just picked this up tonight!  Same great characteristics as the previous vintages.  Its a beautiful beer to look at with a ruby-tinged brown, completely unclouded color.  Candy suger, caramel and butterscotch balanced by the alcohol with a nice hop bitterness in the background.  I think this vintage is more drinkable at its release than some of the past vintages which werent as balanced at first.   Itll be interesting to see if this one ages as well as prior vintages (if I can keep from drinking all of it before then).

2008 vintage:  I have to say of the Old Stock vintages Ive tried, this is probably my least favorite.   However, its also the highest in alcohol (except for the unusual version of the 2006 that I never saw), so it may very well need a few more years of rest before it hits its prime.  Its got the makings of a more age-worthy barleywine in that its sweeter and more biting in alcohol, both of which should mellow over time, but how well remains to be seen.  If I can hold on to the remaining bottles I have for any length of time, Ill update this review.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"
3659,"2010-01-10",3.8,"2009 Vintage. Excellent soft pour produced a massive mid brown bubbly cap that simmers down to a bit more than cover. Tons of messy permanent lacing on top of a deep red brew. Sweet (seems Belgian)... this smells awesome... so much goodness. The aroma doesnt hide: light spice / caramel / biscuit dryness / red berries all blended together to perfection. There is a bit of alcohol. Something smells like fruit cake and toffee. Faint chocolate lingers. Smooth taste! Light spice is noticeable throughout including the very first first impression. More red berries, plum, toffee, weak chocolate and coffee (very weak but its there as a minor characteristic). Light licorice, caramel, more plum. Extremely drinkable at 12.5% - no notice of it. I want to drink a hundred of these. Good chewability, not thick but it could be seen as heavy. A bit viscous. Mild overall bitterness really added to the ease that this can be drank. Full bodied, light spice and light bitterness with an oily finish.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"
3659,"2010-01-08",4.0,"Creamy, wonderfully aromatic and a complex palate are what make this ale worthwhile.  Brown in color with a very small head, the aroma is sophisticated but not overwhelming, a perfect balance.  The downside is it packs a rather sweet punch at first taste.  Malts are a heavy toasted, maple syrup and molasses.  Hops make their presence known with plenty of pine.  The alcohol is heavy.

Kind of an odd nappiness in the aroma that I didnt find appealing... meh.  Taste starts with plumb, caramel malt which gives way to spiced apples, finishing boozy and spicy.  Soft carbonation with a slick feeling on the palate; medium to full body.  Is this really a barley wine?

355 ml bottle. Freshness date on label (Best before August 2010). The label says ""limited release"", but i dont know what its supposed to mean.

Dark, ruby-colored with a cappuccino-colored small head that dissipates quickly. No actual lacings - just a minimal ring of foam around the edges.

Primarily sweet caramel malts coupled with ripe fruits and raisins in the nose. Some notes of chocolate, and perhaps faint notes of saffron. Alcohol becomes present with deeper breaths. The smell is really appealing. Nice.

The taste has sweet caramel malts are up-front. Then pleasant fruity flavors - ripe apples and raisins - appear, coupled with chocolate and nougat. Coffee flavors are also present, which creates a sensation of chocolate coated coffee beans together with the taste of chocolate. The finish is slightly bitter, and perhaps even a bit tart. The well hidden alcohol provides a nice warming feeling. The aftertaste of this one is very long. It leaves a nice, sweet and sticky film in the mouth that lingers on way after the beer is finished. This beer tastes amazing; its heavy and bold with big and rich flavors balanced very nicely. Very complex. If I would mention something on the negative side, I would have to say that it maybe is a little too sweet and therefor becomes a bit too heavy to handle (at least in larger quantities)

Smooth and chewy, medium-bodied leaning towards full. Medium carbonation. The alcohol is certainly present, but hides nicely between the rich flavors.

This is a really good beer, with lots or aromas and nicely balanced flavors. Definitely a sipper. Its actually reminiscent of a brandy, with its rich and balanced - almost luxurious - overall character. One bottle is enough for one night, though. However, I would definitely like to have it again.

NOTE: ABV-level is 12,5% according to the label.

---

2009 vintage. ABV: 11,5%

Brownish amber with a minimal off-white head that quickly fades away. Minimal lacings.

The smell is malty with note of caramel, fudge and vinous fruits (currants, blackberries, plums and raisins).

The taste is sweet with a whole range of malty flavors - caramel, fudge and dark bread. Hints of coffee and leather. Quite a lot of vinous fruits. The finish is mildly bitter with a leafy hop note, wood and sweet and warming alcohol.

Medium body, semi-smooth texture (could have been smoother). Gentle carbonation.

All in all, a good bber, but will probably get better with age. Not as good as the 2008 vintage.

Very hazy dark amber liquid with a very small beige head.
Smell: 7/10

First thing Im hit with is a boozy smell, like sweet liquor or some kind of brandy, also dried fruit, plums, raisin, cherries
Taste: 7/10

Same here, lots of booze and very alcoholic, but also variety of flavours, dried fruit, wood and nuts. It ends with a warm alcoholic finish.
Mouthfeel: 2/5

Dry, semi-harsh with a thick body.
Comment:

This one is very different compared to the Bigfoot Barley Wine I tried yesterday. Allot more alcohol and more of a brandy and dried fruits flavour rather then hops and malt that was the strongest flavours in Bigfoot. Personally I prefer the hoppy kind of barley wine but this is also nice. Something to lean back and sip at for a while. It might need to age a bit longer though and should evolve nicely over a couple of years. I will try and buy a bottle and try later on.","Örebro, SWEDEN","olsvammel"

Aroma: Caramel, alcohol, dark fruits, brown sugar, roasted malts, after breathing for a few minutes this one opened up, and the nose became even nicer, wonderful mix of fruity and roasty malts

Appearance: Nice reddish-brown color, about a finger of fizzy off-white head that dissipates quickly

Palate: A full body, nice mouthfeel, a lot of alcohol burn (though Id guess this would decrease with age)

Overall Impression: 
I wonder if this beer would be better with age?  Probably so.  Heres the problem:  Im not so patient...

Big, bready pillowy 1-finger yeasty head with nice seam, a thick cling to the glass and staying power. Wood-colored body... a split between mahogany hue and cherry darkness - a deep chestnut color? Ample carbonation.

Oooh...some bourbon, vanilla, alcohol - apples, cinnamon and raising with brown sugar. Smells like dessert.

Powerful stuff. Raisins, figs and deep dark caramel malt - a little coffee and some slight earth. Runs very hot from the alcohol - its great but use warmth to calm it down.

Nice feel - a little astringent from alcohol - its good nonetheless. Burns like a good single-barrel bourbon.

The taste was very strong at the beginning and then rounded out well at the end. I was blown away on my first sip with the amount of alcohol character that it had. As it warmed I started to taste some light, pleasant hops, caramel malt, and maybe some toffee. This was a very ""thick"" and boozy beer. Overall very good...

APPEARANCE:

AROMA: 
Strong smell of sweet malts and dark malts along with the heavy scent of alcohol. Rum raisin comes to mind.
FLAVOR: 
Raisin and sweet malts. There are hints chocolate and it finishes with a coffee flavored bitterness. Reminds me of a raisin bran muffin. Amazingly smooth but there is a slight burn from alcohol throughout.
MOUTHFEEL:
Full bodied beer with syrupy consistency and soft carbonation. Slight spicy pepper finish from the alcohol.

This is a great, top class barley wine, not over the top hoppy like some I have had.

3659,"2008-08-18",4.3,"This was a 2000 vintage received in a trade from greger on BA
Impressively this still popped open with a nice pfft. Wow this one still poured with the regular 1 inch caramel colored Old Stock head that I have come to know and love. it fades quickly though to a thin layer of foam.  I poured this at a pretty cold temperature because I like to see how a beer this old progresses over temperatures from 45 to room temp.  Its got a murky, dark ruby brown color that I cannot see through. I think some of the murkiness is from immediately throwing this in the fridge to drink and not letting the bottle settle, but I just had to dig in to this one.  Little in the way of lacing. 
Tons of vanilla, deep caramel malts, nuttiness and cherries dominate the nose with some brandy like alcohol sneaking through. There is also plenty of wood, rum soaked raisin and slight oxidated richness adding to the nose. I can stick my nose in this for hours. Delicious. 
Taste follows suit from the smell. lots of vanilla, caramel, cherry and nuttiness up front. Some of those aforementioned rum soaked raisins and overall very brandy like.  Very dry wine like finish and it leaves a lingering sweet brandy and fruit taste on the tongue.  As it warmed all the way to room temperature I got a slight bit of chocolate and grape as well. This is one complex mother of a beer with this much age on it. 
Nice and syrupy sweet with just a hint of prickly carbonation left, but it felt a little watery at times. 
 Warming alcohol burn in my stomach that is reminiscent of a fine after dinner drink which is exactly what this is. Definitely a sipper. One I will enjoy for hours to come.

Not as much alcohol in the flavor as the abv. might suggest; it tastes heavy and full and complex with strong doughy malty  forefront and a juicy citrus hop background.  This might be the perfect balance of hops and malt for a barley wine.  Rich and coating on the palate with a warm alcoholic finish, soft carbonation, and a medium to heavy body.

3659,"2008-07-15",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 11, 2014 Red-tinged amber color with head hanging around. Malt burst, some alcohol warmth in aroma and flavor, cardboard tinge. Nice fruitiness, but reserved, not quite the complexity one might expect or want. Austere malt and fruit flavors leave one unsuspecting to the potency of this brew. After reading reviews, I did pick up on the almond notes in flavor and aroma--a nice amaretto melding. This was a 2008 label so I expect a future tasting would likely yield a better rating. Re-rate: Had the pleasure of trying the 2009 vintage as part of The Drays Squirreled Away stash. Deep, dense mahogany body with dense, luscious caramel cream head. The nose immediately unfurls notes of caramel, toffee, and melanoidin malt. Gentle nuances of cigar box open up with aeration. It all creates the effect of a well-aged beer that shares the aromatic profile spectrum of doppelbock, barleywine, and old ale. Caramel and marsala flavors dominate. Touches of toffee and cigar box. A lovely aged mustiness. This one is everything you would want in an old stock ale. Aged to near perfection. One you can nurture for hours (depending on the size glass). A splendid sipper. My overall rating is an average of the young and old rating.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"

Red amber color with a slightly tan head; head slowly recedes but still leaves some lacing. Smell of sweet caramel and some dark fruits, even a bit vinous. Taste is sweet (caramel and toffee), alcohol is present, but not overpowering. A bit earthy as well, improves tremendously as it warms; when its cool, its a bit metallic and lacking, when you warm it up it transforms into a solid beer. Higher side of medium carbonation, full bodied, a bit sticky on the tongue.

Given a chance to warm up these scents transferred to darker fruits along with caramel and a hint of vanilla.  In the mouth it was full-bodied with solid weight in the midpalate and a lingering finish.  The hops were still present giving off a slight bitterness on the finish though there was plenty of malt to keep the midpalate sweet.  The flavors were similar to the nose with some added chocolate.

3659,"2008-04-03",4.4,"2004 Bottle. Tasted 04/02/08. 
Poured a deep garnet with a small tan head. This little sipper was quite a knockout. Aroma is slightly boozy with rich sugars, indistinguishable (to me) fruits, vanilla, and perhaps a hint of oak. Alcohol leads in the flavor and up your nose, but very mellow and not overpowering. As this opened up and got to room temperature the flavor gained complexity. Rich dark fruits follow and then lead to a dry and complex (meaning, I cant quite describe it) finish. Definitely no hop presence detectable around the other flavors and aromas. The last few sips felt a little heavy, but besides that it had a wonderful mouthfeel.

Highly effervescent head that bubbles and fizzes nicely but reduces to a small film of bubbles around the edge. Color is dark amber/red, cloudy with a small amount of sediment. Smells extremely vinous with a definate alcohol and sweet fruit note that is pleasant. Overwhelmingly get the smell of alcohol and sweet fruits.  Taste is unexpected. There is really a lot happening but here goes. A really wine like quality that live up to the BarleyWINE name. Extremely smooth in your mouth and it is almost sugary as it washes over your tongue, then your brain deciphers it and you get the true tastes. Sweet fruity flavor with a alcohol backbone, I  get no hops characteristics whatsoever. A good caramel taste sticks with you in the aftertaste. VERY good.","Appleton, Wisconsin, USA","scoobysnak"

3659,"2008-03-18",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2008 Vintage 2006; fresh.  Let to warm, its sweet and softly rich.  Pours to a mahogany red, smelling of various spirits of its color, which Im too unfamiliar with to really distinguish.  Vanilla, caramel, nutmeg.  Magnificent, towering malty texture; a substantial surface of pale malt for a honeyish beginning and a molten core of dense caramel malt.  Raisiny, scotchy, very sweet, but not too aggressively.  A nice snow-day or bonfire accompaniment. 7/4/8/4/16 3.9 

Vintage 2004; three years and five months.  Pours a ruddy, reddened amber hue, bubbles hissing furiously but forming no foam.  Full aroma of pecan pie, dates, cinnamon, and bread; skirtings of melon fruit character, port, raisin, and caramel.  It has this really evocative, abiding tone of seared dessert crust of something like chocolate chip or brown sugar cookies that gives it a special warmth.  Flavor is lightly oxidized and quieted by the weight of sherry and wet cardboard, but still gives a rich and complex presentation of toasted vanilla, brandy and port, black pepper, date, and walnut.  Sweetness has tempered itself quite a bit and run aground into some seriously oily and earthy nut flavors; tangy licks of pineapple, apple, and gingerbread liven up the midpalate very nicely.  Hops seem perfumey and musky.  Barren, wooden alcohol brings a bit of oxidation again; too noticeable.  Really, at times this seems infinitely complex and polished, while at others it only gives a stale, moist cardboard effect.    Definitely hard to gauge, but overall the first impression is more dominant.  Palate is rich and full; scantily carbonated and port-like in texture.  Winks of tropical fruit in the smack, with molasses and pecan bread; dense, lengthy and generous.  Two and half to three years would probably find this example in top form, but as is, its quite a fine one.  9/3/9/4/16 4.1","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Pours a clear ruby orange with a thin soapy mocha head.  Aroma is dark fruit, toffee, caramel, and some earthiness.  Taste is very smooth, with sugar, toffee, with a hint of whiskey or bourbon.  A very easy-drinking mellow BW.  Id have to try a fresher vintage to compare but Im guessing some of the hops and bourbon notes have mellowed over the years.

The taste really smacks you in the face, and for whatever reason despite being far from the highest ABV beer Ive had this one I really felt. Not like I drank it very fast either. When drinking it you get that typical barley wine flavor of wine and malt with hints of vanilla. Very well balanced here. Warms nicely on the way down, slightly thick in the mouth but in a sensible way. A very very good but powerful barley wine that surely will be exceptional with more aging.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
3659,"2008-02-22",4.6,"2002 Edition: One of my longtime favorites, this beer will go into a tulip. The head is much more subdued than my previous bottles from this year. The half inch head quickly fades to nothing. The body is transparent only when held to a light source, and even then one must be quite close to the glass. 

The nose is malty and vinous. Slight vanilla and raisins are detected. This baby is in its prime. The malts are complex. I really cannot pick any individual flavor out of this. The malt is somewhat roasty, with dark fruits as well. The finish is dry, almost like I am drinking Cabernet. Must be the remnants of the hops. The mouthfeel is thick, but not coating as I imagine it once was. Even if there was a hint of the 11.4% ABV, this would be extremely drinkable. Time has been good to this, as the alcohol is buried deeply within this one. I cannot find any more recent vintages of this one in Indy. There seems to be plenty of this one, though. I give a three for appearance because of the enormous head on every other occassion that I drank this one. I will edit this the next time I pop one. 

Edit: My glass might have been slightly dirty the last time. This time, I get the nice head I am accustomed to from this one.

Really sniffable. A proper barley wine flavour. Chunky, spicy and lots of chewy malt. Alcohol is obviously there but not at all over powering. Palate is excellent. Creamy and full giving a wonderful warmth as it slips down. Wood, cardboard, leather and all sorts of other aged stuff. Lovely soft mouth feel. A real malt celebration and bloody enjoyable.

3659,"2008-01-20",4.1,"2007 Batch, 11.7% alcohol: (2) singles from a newly discovered store in my home town. Sparkling yet hazy rich amber color with a copper highlight. Lasting, thin, foamy tan head and very minimal lacing. Calm soothing aroma of strong red wine and figs. Cherries, mild strawberries, and butterscotch with caramel and an assortment of fresh cut flowers. The aroma isnt too prominent, but its complexity lies in its strong subtleness. All these scents are in there, you just have to go searching for them. With roughly a year of age the mouth feel is sweet and smooth with a medium body. A sharp hint of alcohol is still present along with some mild bitterness. Not as rich as I prefer, but still drinks very nicely. Flavor mimics the various aromas. A lot more floral aspects in the taste. Fruity, sweet, with lots of miscellaneous fermented items. A nice bouquet of malts, fruit flavors, and aged hops. Reminiscent of many other great American made Barleyines, but a touch more subtle and mellow. Nice beer to be found.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"

3659,"2008-01-14",4.0,"2007 vintage, aged about 8 months.  Pours a cloudy, murky, brownish-amber body.  A small, foamy, off-white head settles quickly to a swirly film with a slightly pronounced edge.  Virtually no lacing noted, though a swirl of the glass leaves behind runny, sheet-like legging, indicating a substantial body.  The aroma is rich, warm, and alcoholic.  Rich caramel and maple syrup malts are intensified and enhanced by copious amounts of vanilla on the nose.  A deep inhale reveals underlying fruits and nuts, specifically candied apples and pecans.  Moderate alcoholic heat completes the aroma, making this feel like a fruit custard or pie spiked with both vanilla and hazelnut liquors.  The flavor follows suit perfectly, just as rich and decadent as the nose.  A slight burn up front fades quickly, with malty goodness left behind to soothe the palate.  Some spicy hops emerge, joining forces with the moderate carbonation to tickle the tongue and the roof of the mouth.  The hefty vanilla component is reaffirmed, as are the hazelnut and pecan.  A thick, nearly full mouthfeel isnt as syrupy or cloying as I was expecting.  For such a young barley wine, I am thoroughly impressed, though Im sure this will only get better with age.  Overall, this is a great winter warmer or dessert beverage, perfect for sitting by a fireplace or completing a good meal.  I cant think of a more perfect base beer upon which to base the bourbon and brandy barrel aged versions, both of which are also magnificent.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The taste was almost all malt with the above flavors, and almost no discernable hop flavors.  With the high alcohol content and the very sweet flavors, this ale was almost too intense for me right now.

A good bit of visible carbonation.  The nose is burnt toffee and delightful oxidation with some madiera suggestions.  Some brown sugar and alcohol as well.  The age really works well with this one.  More madiera and toffee than cardboard (though there is a little on the finish).  No sweetness, though some brown sugar and hints of coffee.  Very well hidden alcohol.

3659,"2007-10-18",4.0,"Bottle 2007, thanks to me. I bought this simply because its a North Coast beer that I havent had yet. They make some pretty good stuff. The guy at Bruisin Ales told me this one is more like an IPA because of the generous amount of hops. I was definitely intrigued at that point, I love some hoppy barleywines! This is one fine looking beer. The pour is a thick, semi-cloudy dark amber with a very firm tan head. Lacing is dense and layers of cascades are noticed beneath the massive head. The aroma is not so hoppy. I mean, the hops are there, but its not aggressive. I feel this has a surprisingly fruity aroma with hints of melon and berries along with a rich pipe tobacco and caramel foundation. The mouthfeel is nicely dense. mm, this stuff is very complex with layers of flavors ranging from bittersweet earthy tones, berries, flowers, raisins, brown sugar, caramel, and peat. This is not an overly hoppy barleywine. Actually, theres nothing really out of character on this one except the rich fruity flavors. However, this is a very well made and savory ale. The alcohol is perfectly masked. I dont even get burn in my nose. Excellent barleywine!","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
3659,"2007-10-15",4.0,"The 12 ounce bottle poured a beautiful clear rich ruby red colored beverage with a small creamy off-white head that lasted well and left some lacing on the glass. The aroma was not yet well developed for the style but it was somewhat sweet and fruity with lots of caramel and spice notes in the background. The body was quite full with soft carbonation and a thick, smooth texture. The flavor started out strongly sweet and stayed that way throughout the very long finish. This was all accompanied by a growing warmth in the chest through the end.","Wichita, Kansas, USA","henry3r"

Pours a clear but deep ruby with a tan head. Nose is fairly mild actually. Minute amounts of cherry. Flavor hits with a quick punch of sweetness and then the alcohol takes over. In my opinion it stays way too long as it leaves a aftertaste on the mouth. Just seems a bit too much, though it doesnt completely overpower. I wonder what age would do to that. Slight cherry tone. Feel is slightly syrupy with minimal carbonation. Even though at first the alcohol is extremely present, this one is highly drinkable.

------- 07.  a very strong barley wine that oozes alcohol notes and flavors.  not too strong though - very manageable.

Nose was rich with toffee and caramel with a little dried fruit. The flavor is rich caramel, dried fruit and some subtle cherries in mid to back palate, with a slightly bitter finish.

Tempted to simply write ""Wow"" and nothing more but this beer was crafted with care and so should its review be. Simply put this is a tremendous beer that brings meaning to the words Craft Brewed. Intense to say the least with a complexity that makes you involve yourself in every sip. There are hints of caramel, taffy, vanilla sweet fruits and a nice alchohol warming. Reminds me of the Cognac my father loved so much. Drink this beer almost warm, sip it slowly and appreciate every mouthful as it was brewed by a master, who was proud of what he made.","Wharton, New Jersey, USA","NotWthoutStout"

3659,"2007-07-21",3.8,"2006 bottle (12 oz.). At 13.25% abv, this may be the strongest beer I have tried to date. Rich, classic sweet barley wine aroma: chocolate-covered cherries, raisins, and a hint of oranges as well as some smokiness. Aroma reminiscent of a merlot or port. Pours a slightly hazy mahogany with a golden / amber hue. Glows a brilliant burnt orange / red when held up to the light. Small to moderate amount of short-lasting, thick, tight, yellowish-tan head. Produces limited, brief lacing. Dark pitted fruit sweetness dominates the initial taste. A little too sweet for my tastes. Cherry, plum, pepper, and molasses flavors. Alcohol obvious in the taste. Dry, spicy, bitter finish appears to derive from the high alcohol content rather than the hops. Sweet fruit aftertaste. Full body. Sharp in the palate from surprisingly lively carbonation and alcohol. Easy to drink for such a thick and high-alcohol ale. I dont get the cognac aroma or flavors that many others have mentioned. Actually, I sense more of a rum-like taste. I think that oak-aging could benefit this beer, as the wood would complement the existing flavors and add a bit of character (as well as actually impart a brandy-esque quality). Admittedly, a sunny summer Saturday is probably not the best time to drink this brew. If I had tried this on a cold winter night instead, I venture that I would have enjoyed it more. Old Stock Ale is a quality beer and well worth a try, but there are better strong barley wines out there.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
3659,"2007-07-20",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 11, 2007 2005--Huge soft white head that slowly fades to about a half a fingers width. The nose is one of a typical European barley wine --all malt.  A sweetness builds, but i will have to say it is muted compared to when I had this same brew in the winter of 2005,  just  before Christmas.  At the front end it has a burnt caramel/fruit that just is the perfect strength.  There is some bitterness here, but the malt is king in this brew.  This is much better with age.  I let this one sit for two years, and I dont think it will get any better.  

06--it gets even better.  It is not over the top sweet, and the alc is hidden well.  It does have a hefty body, with moderate bitterness.  There is sweetness with a toffee like and mild nuttiness to it.","Chesterfield, Virginia, USA","luv2brew"

Cloudy reddish brown color.  Initial tan head that quickly faded.  Small bubbles rising strickly from the middle of the glass.  Overyly sweet smell of plums and yams.  No detectable hops in the aroma.  Thick and flat palate to this high gravity brew.  Tremendously sweet raisin and added sugar flavor, overpowering the malt and obliterating any hops that are part of the blend.  The high sugary flavor must be needed to make 11.7% palatable (as compared to say Samiclaus) but it makes it a tad too sweet to truly enjoy.","Florida, USA","TheBeerBaron"

Strong fruitiness.  Red body with strong visible carbonation and a creamy, lacing, rocky tanned head.  Chewy, full body, touch of caramel.  Taste is very fruity, only lightly bitter despite the nice, firm hop notes.  blends into a gorgeous smoky peat.  Dry aftertaste lingers with the integrated alcohol a pleasant warm blanket.  Well-balanced and a worthy sipper.  Superb.Having had Bells Third Coast Old Ale just over a week ago, I think Ill roll with the Michigander.  But it wasnt an easy decision. [2007.06.10: 4.0]2014 bottle here in 2015. Nose is swirling dark toffee and Bock-like decoction browning with grade and light red berry.  Tons of malt depth.  Pours deep, tawny caramel-brown with a foamy tan head.  Taste is sweet with candy sugar, lots of candy grape and cherry, red berry, sugary and malty, light bitterness that doesnt manage to balance.  Light caramel and sudsy full body, crisp and nourishing despite the heavy weight.  Touch smoky, pepper, low-level but rewarding esters, very bright with minimal alcohol, mainly felt in the warmth.  The slightly sugary malt is out of this world, and though this younger bottle strikes me differently than the slightly more aged bottles had in the past, I may like it even more (my sweet tooth likes the Doppelbock similarity).  [2015.05.09: 4.3]A 2011 vintage here in 2015.  More wood (and even cork!) character right out of the bottle neck, then follows through with rich, sugary malt.  Still pretty harshly alcoholic on the palate despite the age, yet warmth comes only slowly and slightly, much more in the way of fizz and short, sharp burn.  Sugary fruit hold up as the Doppelbock comparison fades; this bottle, at least, has more in common with rye whiskey. A bit frenetic and all over the place.

3659,"2007-06-07",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2008 (Vintage 2004)

Appearance: Marvelous color; a stunning mosaic of reds, browns, and golds. Even when poured a wee bit aggressively, the head quickly seperated, stretched thinly across the surface of the beer. 

Smell: Mammoth malts weigh heavily in the nose. Thick molasses, brandy, vanilla, dried raisins, and alcohol are all very prominent. 

Taste: ""Hands up"" on this malt rollercoaster, please! The vibrant flavors are varied and plentiful. Richly textured caramel and sweetened molasses up front. Sweet, ripened fruits roll by the palate, followed with sugar-coated bread. All of these flavors are punctuated by a zippy spiciness. The 11.4% alcohol is, at first, cumbersome on the palate, but eventually mellows to a relaxing hotness. 

Mouthfeel: Medium. Considerably lighter than I remember it being, although its alcohol, syrupiness, and colossal range of flavors help it to seem a bit hardier.

Drinkability: Such an excellent example of balance within a beer. Its all so very impressive. Drinkable? Definitely, but the alcohol can really shake you up, so take it easy, friends. Ill certainly be returning to the store to grab more to cellar.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
3659,"2007-06-04",4.2,"2006 Vintage. Pours a clear light brown with a smallish, creamy, tan head. The aroma is heavy caramel malts, port, dates and a considerable alcohol note. Im not surprised to see that years ABV is @ 13.25%, but Im not complaining either. The mouthfeel is full-bodied, creamy and effervescent. The flavor is very sweet dark fruits, sugar plums, raisins and a port-like warm alcohol finish.

I pondered over the option of aging this a couple of years because it could definitely handle it, but ultimately thought better of it and decided to just drink the damn thing.

Slowly the beer takes on a different taste of liquorice and spice. Caramel and chocolate all together but showing them selves separately. For a strong ale I really enjoyed this one. Not overpowering and probably my favourite of this strength. 2008 - Looks great. Berries, spice. like a mutated port wine. Rich in flavour. Spiced. Reminds me of Christmas. Little smoky. Lovely warming ale. 2013- Amber colour with a fast disapating head. Fruit, malt whiskey aroma. Rich flavour of boozy trifle, fruit and malt. Quite delicious. Tangy spice finish. Syrup texture.

3659,"2007-05-13",3.7,"2007 bottled edition.  Dark amber color, not much head or lacing.  Has to be poured pretty vigorously to get any head on it.  Very strong, vinous, winey sort of brew.

Flavor is lightly sweet and nutty, followed by dull alcohol and some cinnamon.  As it warms it gets a little richer, some hop bit and lots of candied barley.   Finishes hot.

Final thoughts: The 2007 was the hardest to drink as this is a beer that clearly needs age on it. The 2006 was much improved since its release and starting to develop its aged character, this one could be the best batch yet in a few years. The 2005 was really the odd one, perhaps a bad bottle. We were all surprised the 03-05 werent more oxidized. 2003 was the winner but I cant see it getting much better, perhaps it could last another year although it wouldnt be too oxidized it just might drop off and start to fall apart. damn wish we had an 02 here.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

Quite musty with some abv warmth.  There is also a light amount of pine / woody hops.  Medium / thick body with a moderate amount of sharp carbonation that is between soft and sharp.  The flavor starts with lots of thick malt like in the aroma, some abv warmth, but for the actual content is is not bad at all.  The finish has some spice and a kick to it.

3659,"2007-02-11",4.2,"THOUGHTS: Hides alcohol well. Reminds me a little of Sam Adams Triple Bock. Not really what I was expecting, but still a great beer. I really dont understnd why this gets such high marks and Sam Adam Triple Bock doesnt when there are a lot of similarities. I could never understand how the Triple bock was a barley wine, since it was so much different than the others Ive tried, but the Old Stock was the missing link between the SA Triple Bock and other barley wines. This would probably be even better with some aging.
TECHNICAL: 2006 bottle. Poured a medium to dark brown with a small, almost soapy, off-white head that fully diminished. The aroma was heavy to almost harsh caramel malt along with chocolate syrup, soy sauce, sweet candy, light alcohol and underlying vinegar. The initial flavor was heavily sweet, with the finish flavor was heavy to harsh sweetness, light to moderate bitterness and just a tad salty. Caramel and chocolate syrup were throughout.

Appearance is a sparkling, beautiful red color with a somewhat abundnant head that is very durable.  Aroma is very bourbon-y and slightly sweet.  Taste is also very bourbon-y, but without the over-sweetness or alcohol astringency that is associated with bourbon-barrel aged beer.  It is great for those who like bourbon, but bourbon-barrel-aging is too much for (thats me!).

I saved this bottle, and after talking to some ratebeerians on the forum I thought why not crack it open it might be the right time.  The beer pours a dark reddish mahogany with a tan head that quickly has become a wide wing with an island of foam that looks sort of like a mallet from the perspective of looking at it from below.  The scent is rich dried fruit, sweet raisins.  The scent is quite potent.    The taste is thick rich and vinious, it warms the throat while also burning a bit more than Id like.  The aroma comes through in the taste but I cant but my finger on the notes.  The alchol is certainly there but it is not in the forefront it has mellowed nicely over time.

2003 Vintage
5/21/2008:  North Coast Old Stock Ale 2003 has an opaque dark amber brown color with some golden highlights.  There is no head, but there is still some active carbonation.  The aroma is deeply malty with rich and creamy caramel and, lightly roasted malt, and a tinge of whisky-like alcohol.  The flavor is also intensely malty and quite sweet.  It has a nice balance of smooth, rich and creamy caramel, dark raisins, sweet dates, caramelized fruits, syrupy white grapes, and warming whisky alcohol and cigar-like tobacco and deep, aged apricot flavor that adds to the experience.  The alcohol really isnt overpowering or out of place in any way.  This beer has a full body and is smooth smooth is a good creaminess that coats the palate and mouth nicely.  This vintage is really good right now and will continue to be so for several more years to come at least...

3659,"2006-12-19",4.2,"This weekend I did a 3 year vertical of this. 02,03,04 all were very nice. This beer ages very well, the 2002 started having a bit of oxidation, but nothing that was too distracting. All beers being 2+ years old had a great balance with no alcohol being apparent. Its amazing how smooth this beer gets as it ages. While it doesnt start out with the hops that beers like Bigfoot have, it still ages to a great malt character. The hops really die out, but that leaves you with a great malt flavor that picks up sherry notes, plum, caramel, and fig. The 2002 had a very nice fig flavor in the start finishing with a bit more of a sherry flavor. The 2003 had a bit more fruitiness, more plum and caramel and a bit of molasses. The 2004 had more hops so it gained a bit more hop balance. I realy recommend aging these, they did really well, even at 4 years old there was very little oxidation, the carbonation was still all there,  and the flavors were brilliant.

3659,"2006-12-17",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2008 12 oz bottle via liquid Solutions. 2005 vintage...Pours a dark reddish brown with a large tan head. Subtle nose of toasted grains, caramel, vanilla. Taste is of molasses, caramel, toffee and plums with an alcohol finish that is good and not too hot. Awesome beer but more like an Old ale than a barleywine. World class stuff in either case....drinkable and tastey

12 oz 2008cbottle via Liquid SOL. Pours a semi-clear copper with an average size beige head. Nose is toffee and candy with some fruitiness. Taste is very malty, lots of caramel and biscuity. A bit of candy which i assume is from the yeast, as well as a little spiciness...cinnamon and ginger. Finish is a little hot and the earthy hops are generous, cellaring would help. Body is medium. Carbonation just right. A good beer, that will be better with age.

Sweet caramel body with strong surfaced alcohol, which hurts the throat. Slightly chocolatey and caramel notes, slight zesty peppery alcohol bite, light citrus (tangerine) hint, a resiny hop touch and a long roasty dry alcohol burn finish.

3659,"2006-12-01",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2008 Bottle, 2004 (Im the 667 rater, bad luck to the fella before me).  Murky brown color with a very thin off white head.  Farily complex aroma: alcohol, caramel malts, vanilla, oak, pepper, spices, anise, faint hops.  Flavor is not as pleasant as the aroma, I was hoping for more hops.  Still, decent, malts, bitter almond, peppery and spicy again, alcohol and bitter on the finish.  Finish is strangely bitter, more like the pith of an orange than that pleasant bitterness you get from hops.  Mouthfeel is a bit oily, but carbonation is good.  This beer isnt bad, but it falls off steeply in comparison to the aroma.  I can definitely taste, and feel, the alcohol.  Worth having, but not more than once........

The flavor stays the course of the nose, some sort of melon meets maple syrup with some sort of spice, but in a GREAT way! 13.25% I just cant see (until it hits me upside the head!).

Very strong aroma of malt, dark fruit and alcohol, wiith taste more of the same. As beer warms, the alcohol (13.25%) becomes much more dominant.

Smells very much like grapes, with caramel and brown sugar.  Clearly beer, but very winelike.  Very sweet taste, but in a careless sugary fashion.  This is incredibly nice and smooth, yet strong, with toffee, butterscotch and vinuous notes going down.  According to my girlfriend (with an excellent sense of smell), this beer has some sort of ""Christmas bread"" flavor to it.  I felt like I can taste my Grandmas basement in this beer somehow.  Its as if the term ""cellaring"" became more literal than intended.  Thick full mouthfeel, very low carbonation.  A beer that veils as many different flavors as it flaunts.

This is a smooth drinking beer and the light aftertaste is sweet and pleasant.  It also tends to change moment by moment and cascades in waves.

07 - Clear orange brown with a soapy beige head.  Caramels, toffee, alcohol, cherries, red fruit, yeast, and bread in the nose.  Alcohol heat is the first thing I notice.  Toffee, anise, tar, bread, and maple syrup.  The alcohol has a certain pineyness to it that Ive noticed in fresh hot beers.  Much more yeasty and alchy than the others.

This one is sweeter than most of the others.  Alcohol has subsided rather quickly.  Toffee cherries, maple syrup, caramel, bread and alcohol are balanced rather well.  Nice creamy full body.  Becomes a little overly sweet as it warms.  But still one of the nicer vintages. 8/3/8/4/16 = 3.9

05 Pours a slightly hazed orange brown with a soapy beige head that has a greenish tint to it.  Nose is abundant but not as good.

3659,"2006-08-22",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 17, 2011 2003 bottle @ 11.4%. It has been cellaring for a while. Served in a Duvel tulip just a few minutes out of the fridge.

The aroma is strong and of dark fruits (figs, prunes), brown sugar, vanilla, cream, some herbal notes as well. The mouthfeel is full and expanding. The initial taste is vanila ice cream, brown sugar, overripe dark fruits the midtaste is all of that, in addition there is some bitterness, alcohol, and an almost oaky flavor present. The finish is warming and lingering, with a nice aftertase. Not sure what this is like new, but it is awfully tasty after 3 years in the bottle. At this age, it is English in style. 8/4/8/4/17 4.1  
2 bottle tasting, 2003 bottle @ 11.4% & 2008 bottle @ 12.5%
Older bottle is 8 years old, younger is the 3 years old, just like my prior rating. More overall pleasant oxidation and strong, dark fruit character in the older version. Color is dark red and similar between the two beers, both have small, wispy heads, the older is smaller. The older version is spicy black pepper, dried dates and prunes, some toffee and dark caramel, tobacco and old wood. The younger beer has rich flavors as well, with dark caramel and raisins with some warming alcohol and a bit more substantial mouthfeel. The 08 seemingly could use a little more time in the bottle, while the 03 is drinking beautifully right now and with less than ideal cellaring temps over these past 8 years. Id probably score the newer beer a bit less than the 4.1 I gave its 03 brother back in 06, but the 03 at 8 years is a little better than at 3 years, score increases a bit.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

% ABV)
Pours a very dark reddish amber with almost no head after an agressive pour.
Head disappears very quickly to ....nothing.
Aroma is extremely subdued....almost non-existent.  Slight medicinal alcohol and slight scent of dark fruits like raisens and prunes. As it warms more to room temperature both the brown sugar and alcohol scents become much more prominent.
Taste is not at all as subdued as the aroma.  Rich brown sugar, caramel, raisins, prunes, other assorted dark candied fruits.  Definate alcohol aftertaste begins creeping in right after the brown sugar slides over your tongue and then fills the back of your throat on the way down.  As it warms to room temperature, alcohol taste begins to overpower the rest of the flavors on the palette.  Let ut warm some more and its mostly burnt carmel with alcohol.
Most definately VERY warming for a long time between sips.
Mouthfeel is rich, thick, and creamy.
I really wasnt prepared to like this brew at all.  I generally want Old Stock to age at least a year...two is even better...before I can enjoy drinking it. Its much too unbalanced and raw for me otherwise.  This one is 13.25% abv and brand new and I honestly like it a lot.  This sips like an excellent aged brandy.
This one is an excellent end to the evening.
I definately have to save some for cellaring but it will be hard to do.

Aroma (8): Molasses, pumpernickel. Sweet and refreshing berry scent (as of red currants)  vinous.
Really wonderful. Astonishingly complex yet nuanced. Alcohol warmth.
Nice balance between roasted, alcoholic hot  amost kräuterlikör-like  vinous and sweet, almost summery notes.
Overall: yes!
Flavour (8): Very good initial balance of espressolike roasted bitterness, dark malt and molasses. Lovely!
This is the perfect beer to truly explore. So many details with the flavour that differs from other beers.
Id say its got a pretty dark flavour for such a non-dark beer. Judging by the looks you wouldnt expect such malt deepness.
The aftertaste is remarkably milky and lettuce-like, believe it or not. Well to be truthful, it actually reminds me of dandelion leaves.
There is some sort of hazelnut or coconut thing going on somewhere in the background as well.
Very nice.

Appearance (4): Profound red, beautiful body.
Pretty, yellowish foam with a crema-texture.
It doesnt immediately go away either  yay!
I actually really like the look of this beer. The foam sort of cracks up really slowly with small holes.
Sticky lacing.

Figgy, pruney, anisey. Sweet just past the point of cloying. Definitely needs to be laid down for at least a year or two.

The aroma is huge with fruit--you can smell this beer from a couple of feet away. There are the faintest streams of carbonation rising (near the bottom in a semi-unusual hollow stemmed glass), but in the main this is an intensely thick beer that doesnt encourage a lot of moving around by the bubbles. The palate feels beautifull carbed though--the bubbles are definitely there. A little bit boozy-hot on the finish, but not unpleasant at all. Truly a winter warmer.

There is also is mellow alcohol aroma that does not burn like some high alcohol beers but is still strong and almost makes me feel drunk just smelling it.  Flavor is suprisingly smooth for a 13.25% abv beer, though it is still strong, it has a mellow caramel malt base with light roasted flavors hiding in the shadows.  Hops are there though not at any kind of barleywine quantity.  Sweet though balanced with the high alcohol.  The burn of the alcohol is similar to a well aged single malt, you know its there but it is does not burn to the point of being undesirable.

3659,"2006-06-19",2.5,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2007 After reading the reviews for this dark and inhospitable ale, Im almost certain I had a spoiled bottle.  Everyones raving about well balanced sweetness, roastiness and the overall superb quality of the beer.  My experience was apparently much narrower, obscuring the verisimilar personality within that humble little bottle.  The Old Stock Ale was a passive, pomegranate red beneath a temporal sandy colored head.  From this came an abyss of aromas, whose parts included chopped walnuts, figs and brown sugars, along with the more obvious roasted malts.  But to say this smell was deep would be doing it a dishonor.  Ive never smelled something quite so dense, deep and dark before.  It was a congested pit of pressured flavor within my olfactory  a sensation I hardly expected, even from a putatively shaded beer.  But the taste was less sensational, and more painful.  It began with a grand explosion of deep sweetness, aggrandized mostly by brown sugar.  Then it took a plummet into an eye cringing morass of alcohol and relentlessly assaulted my senses for nigh six seconds afterwards.  It was a terrible feeling having a semi-permanent clod of alcohol stuck to my tongue after each and every sip.  I read the commercial description and they discuss the necessity of aging, which Im willing to try and then re-gauge the Old Stock Ale.  Its not that I objurgate to the overwhelming praise in these reviews, only that I must fairly evaluate my experience, which was certainly a negative one.  Second review pending.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

3659,"2006-05-23",3.8,"Bottle: I echo starfireming - bourbon is right.  It has a chocolaty murky brown color (more red-brown in brighter light) with a bubbly off-white head.  The aromas were many - sweet spices, chocolate, lightly roasted malts, apricots and brown sugar.  The taste was suprisingly sweet for a barley wine.  It was like liquor showing the strong alcohol content.  I tasted candy flavors and ripe pitted & dried fruits like prunes.  The feel was thick and powerful, quite syrupy.  There is a lot to process with this bad boy.  Complex and heavy duty.  Another great brew from North Coast.","Boise, Idaho, USA","pinkzambia"

A lot of alcohol in the aroma, but it doesnt mask the other smells- which include grapes, caramel, sweet malt, and hops.  The palate is thick, creamy (almost sticky).  The flavour matches the aroma pretty well, especially the caramel and grapes, and the alcohol doesnt dominate here but instead complements the flavours nicely.      There is nothing subtle about the aroma/flavors of this one- its strong, full bodied and complex.  I really enjoyed it!","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","tcruicks"
3659,"2006-05-14",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2006 2005 bottle.  Pours a clear deep redbrown with a very thin offwhite head.  Theres a lot of alcohol in the nose, but its as though the alcohol is carrying new aromas to my nose, not just fighting with the usual suspects.  Huge caramel malt obviously, leather, a bit of bubble gum, and some very light floral to fruity aromas.  Sudsy in the mouth, this is a beer that demands to be kept in the mouth for a good while as the alcohol warming sets in.  The flavors are bolder on the tongue than I wouldve first thought, while the alcohol is an afterthought.  A big sweet sticky malt backbone with creamy to floral flavors filling out hte profile.  Some strong herbal, mint and maybe anise flavors sneak in.  Im guessing the lingering bitterness is thanks to some forward thinking liberal hopping that must have made this a hop bomb a bit earlier on, but now provides a great backdrop for the malt and alcohol to play within.  I really liked this bold barleywine.
2002 bottle (Dec. 12 2006) In many ways a different barleywine.  Slightly murky redbrown with a sizeable tan to off white head, that disappears quickly.  The nose is big with malt, but it doesnt smell quite so huge.  Leather, some light dark fruits, especially raisin, are detectable, no hops.  The palate seems a bit thin for the style, but not sudsy like the 2005 I had.  Still nice, especially with the warming.  The flavors are well contructed.  Port like dark fruit flavors predominate. Theres malt, but its so subdued compared to the fruity flavors.  Hints of molasses, but predominantly port in the finish.  Theres a bit of hops that gets you towards the end of the finish and in the aftertaste, though the aftertaste is dominated by woody flavors and alcohol.  But this is deifnitely one of those beers than thrives on the alcohol.  Im glad I found a 4 pack of this stuff!  Im giving this another point in the overall, as I really enjoyed this vintage.  I hate to say it, but it tastes a tiny bit like the Sam Adams triple bock, but without the nasty aspects, so I think Ill drink this down soon!","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

Lots of alcohol in the nose, and a lot of raisins.  Not as malty in flavor as I expected.  Quite dry in fact.  This leaves the alcohol very accessible, but its more a flavor complement than a flavor on its own.  Its good, that is.  But I got a feeling it wont be as the beer warms further.  Almost a thin mouthfeel, the profile is quite quick and the finish brief.  A nice variation from the normal malty monster that is your usual American barleywine.  Yeah, this is almost English.  For once to a beers advantage.  as final notes, a) didnt get worse as it warmed, and b) very surprised to see the other ratings discuss hops and malts so much.  my beer was very straightforward.  clearly, the sum is greater than the parts.","chicago, Illinois, USA","sersdf"

September 2010. Spectacular. Rich toffee with surprising amounts of cocoa. Seems to have done just fine with 6 years in the cellar. Id go around 4.2 or 4.3
2005 vintage

April 2006 at slightly too cold a serving temperature.
The beer pours a lovely red-brown, garnet with the light shining through it, a small head that fades quickly to a swirl of fine foam at the center of the glass.
The aroma is candied grapefruit and a hint of toffee; the flavor is rich and complex, plenty of sweet toffee, malts that dance and engage, bits of citrus though not the heavy orange muscat we get with many barleywines, and less hop prevalence than I expected. Spices, alcohol warmth, a smooth mouthfeel that massages the tongue. 
Marvellous beer, and this one hasnt even aged. Im eager to see what this beer does with a few years in the cellar. Ill be laying this one down in good measure.

September 2007. The grapefruit is all but gone in the aroma; toffee and vanilla dominate the nose now. The flavor is getting very smooth, gently sweet with delightful citrus candy tones, woody in the finish, light well-integrated spices, mild smoky peat bringing a single-malt character, marvellous mouthfeel that is full-bodied and lacking any hint of the alcohol. Id dial this one in at about 8/4/9/5/17 for a 4.3 one tenth of a point above listed previously.
May 08
Cellar temperature. Toffee, spicy single-malt scotch, alcohol a bit more prominent than I remember. Still hovering around 4.3

June 09 Cellar temp. All toffee and honey, maybe starting to thin out just a bit? Actually getting kind of hot in the mouthfeel, but still very nice. More like 4.0 this time.

Dec 09Yep, on the downslide. Still darn good, though.

2006 Vintage

October 2006. Malty nose of fresh-baked whole wheat bread, drizzled with honey and topped off with orange marmalade. The flavor is sweet and candied, toffee and oranges, lots of coconut, grapefruit and ample alcohol , again not as heavy on the hops as one might have expected. This year, its gone from 11.4 to 13.2, and its just too damn hot (not to mention

In my youth I made home brews that had a similar aroma when opening the bottle.  The color was clear dark amber.  It is very attractive.  The high alcohol overpowers some its characteristics.  It is a drink to sip and enjoy slowly.  My beer temperature may have been too cool.  It is more like wine than a beer.  The hops and malt do express themselves. The finish was a little thin and not as full as some beers that I enjoy.   Since this is a vintage type product it should be rated based on the year.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Foxbush"

Less hops in the aroma than an Old Horizontal.  I prefer the less hoppy ones and this is perfect but above the average British BW.  The flavor is sweet with a nice bitterness at the end.  For me a great balance of a west coast BW without the overbearing hops.  Going to let another bottle sit around for a few years and then rerate. 8/4/8/4/17.  Rerate 9/27/06: Well, I am overtaken by how different this 2006 bottle came out.  I mean I get all these sherry notes which I never got before.

Soon fades to absolutely nothing and leaves a dark copper, dead looking body.  Aroma is strong and so is the taste with lots of alcohol, makes my nostrils stand up.   It hides a lot of the raison biscuit in the beer.  Taste also ends with some bitter, bitter chocolate flavor.  This is the least favorite of the beers I have had, a complete alcohol bomb.

Full nectar w/ ample mellow yet explosive residual effers. Alcohol right upfront w/ a sweet malty backbone. Not a complex brew at all. Theres the caramel, cherry fruit, peach nectar, and fresh pine. The finish is bittered moderately w/ a peachpit component and leaves a little alcohol on the tongue. Very warming and potent. *****
2006: SCORE 4.1 / Pours deep dark amber w/ a shallow froth. Aromas of sweet malt, aged plumb and cherries. Full nectar w/ ample mellow residual effers. Flavors are strong, rich, and sticky sweet w/ a peach pit bittering. Secondary flavors of brandy, tobacco, oak, black cherry, ripe plumbs, caramel, green apricots, citrus rind, celery, and more. Finish has a lingering bitterness that overcomes previous flavors. Not balanced. Alcohol flavors are present. This one will benefit from aging. Very complex. I see the potential but its miles away sonny.
2005: SCORE 3.9/  A golden color on the pour with full nectar. Rich, sweet, and creamy. Light in color for its genre and real easy to drink. Not as complex as Id expect from these guys. Nice ballance and ready to go. Alcohol is dangerously well hidden .","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"

3659,"2006-02-23",3.8,"04 release...Pours a nice swampy amber color with pretty no head.  Aroma is very creamy and sugary...some thick fruity sweetness.  Oh...this has something to the taste that Ive never had in a beer before.  There is a lot of sweet malt and fruity flavor...as well as some hop bitterness towards the end.  There is a really woody character to this brew and Ill classify my surprise from above as something to do with this...like a highly finished wood...not quite chemically, but something along those lines.  The mouthfeel is very light for its appearance...but it is still intensely creamy...I know I cant explain it.  Id very much like to try a 03 and an 05 after having this brew.

Heavy malt aroma with some nuttiness, caramel, slight hints of raisin, and a whiskey burn. More than a little port wine going on here. To me the body  is pretty thin with strikingly present carbonation. The moderately sweet taste turns to a strong alcohol burn- also very much like a tawny port, but without the body to support the intensity of flavor. Ends on burnt caramel with a sweet that lingers. Maybe I just dont like barleywines, but I wasnt that into it. Of interest: I accompanied the beer with some salty aged cheese at the end, and for some reason, it became more effervescent and smooth as a result.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","jgeiman"

""Oh my,"" I actually proclaim as I taste this one.

Pours a brownish/red with a half inch off-white head that quickly fades away to a thin ring that leaves a decent amount of lace. Pretty nice considering the high abv.

Smell; dark sweet cherries and a little bit of apples, rich chocolate and caramel. Theres also a presence of alcohol in the nose that mingles pretty well with averything alse.

Taste; the rich caramel malts jump out with the initial sip, but then the darks fruits kind of slide in there without being overly sweet. The alcohol has a presence in the flavor, but its not biting or overwhelming. The year this has had to sit has mellowed out the hop bitterness quite a bit without developing any off tastes from oxidation. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy. Drinkability takes a bit of a hit with such a high abv.

I consider this brew just as classy and enjoyable to drink as whatever it was I drank those nights across the pond. This is about twice as strong in alcohol as the average beer or ale, but the alcohol taste is well integrated in a pleasant way with the wonderful flavor of the drink.","Illinois, USA","soulrefugee"
3659,"2005-11-13",3.9,"Cloudy amber/brown - opaque in the middle and clearing around the edges.  Alcholic fruity aramel aroma.  Taste follows.  Alcohol-caramel-smoky-malt mixture with fruity (raisin) undertones.  Butterscotch mouthfeel - rich and coating.  Alcohol remains strong throughout.  Mixes well with other flavors, but definitely a sipping beer, and a good one at that.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","BillyM"
3659,"2005-11-12",3.2,"UPDATED: MAR 2, 2006 Bottle.  Pours murkey, swamp water like brown.  Thin off white head that diminishes to nothing quickly.  Aromas of sweet fruits, melons and caramel.  Tastes like caramel and lots of sweet fruits, raisins and apricots.  Very sweet and sugary.  More chocolate as this warms.  Alcohol is well hidden initially but more prevalent when warms.    Finish is dry and bitter.  Fairly smooth beer, tingles my lips, but they are chapped a little.  Decent, but not what I was expecting from this barley wine.

Re-Rate 3/2/06
I wanted to give this a second chance, but I just dont like this beer, way too sugary.  I like a bigger hop presence in barley wines and Im not getting that here.  Way to sugary and heavy.","Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, USA","madcow75"

Medium to full-bodied and quite soft.  Raisins and plums in the taste along with candied sugar and butterscotch.  Some oak and prunes in there too.  A dry, hoppy finish.  This is my second North Coast beer.  Both have been very overrated.","Washington DC, USA","lamas"

The head stays around for a while and leaves lace that slowly slides back down to its creator.  Lovely aroma of figs, lots of sweetness, dried dark fruits, some melon.After being poured a light sweet fruity smell comes from the glass being accompanied by caramel a slight alcohol scent. Caramel covered fruity sweetness meets your lips with the first sip. A bit of hop bittering provides a nice balance as the finish is quite warming with a slight alcohol sting on the tip on the tongue.

Taste is like a cross between a beer and a fine sweet red wine.  Tastes of raisin, plum, caramel, toffee, with brilliant grassy and floral hopes notes and an oaky, earthy taste as well.  Suberb balance between the malt and hops with a great spicy quality.  It feels perfect in the mouth too.  Velvety smooth, creamy, and goes down warm.

Flavor is much the same.   Like sipping brandy, and its definitely a sipper.  Not a beer that is easily quaffed.  Reminiscent of the Dogfish Head WWS.

3659,"2005-10-28",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2007 2003 Bottle.  Pours a fiery deep reddish-burgundy with a minimal layer of beige head (mainly a ring around the edges).  Thick pour.  Sweet, malty nose with heaps of dark fruits (sugar plums, prunes, & raisins), English-style hoppage, and caramel.  Reminded me a bit of Harvest Ale.  Thick and chewy on the palate, allowing the multitude of flavors to envelop and enslave my helpless tastebuds!  Massive caramel and pruney sweetness provided a great base for the mildly bitter grassy hops, oak, molassess, toffee, and alcohol that were also present.  Long, sticky, and warming finish of sugar plums, caramel, and alcohol.  Tremendous brew!  2000 bottle thanks to Blake!  Poured much darker than expected.. clear coppery-Port color with a loose layer of tan head and large bubbles on the ring.  The aroma picked up lots or rich caramelization and deeper vinous notes with some apparent warmth and some herbal/medicinal notes present.. deep, rich, and enjoyable.  The flavor had bunches of rich caramel and toasted barley accented by dampened herbal bitterness.. warm, rather boozy finish.  Tasty stuff!  Medium-bodied (lighter than expected) and syrupy on the palate.. warm, peppery alcohol on the finish.. still really strong, but smoother than the newer bottles.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Aroma is supercharged with cherry vats, cinnamon, fig extract, Hot Tamales, prune skin, oak batter and black cherries.  Flavor encasement begins with an incredibly balanced composure of thick concord grapes, cherry pits, red currant and boysenberry syrup.  Smooth oak vat traits furthers the balanced rendition.  Rich fruity esters perpetuate golden raisings sitting in raspberry vinaigrette.  Cyclical and unison as it rolls around the palate, mimicking a sucking nature on the taste bud receptors.

Taste initially is a huge blast of the aforementioned malts. Damn. A good mix of dark fruits come into the mix, mostly raisins and plum. Alcohol is noticeable, but not overly so. Begins sweet, finishes somewhat astringent, probably due to the alcohol. No hops at all, which is defintely different from all the other barleywines Ive had. Dont know the age of this beer. Almost reminds me of a dopplebock in some qualities. Only drawback was a slight metallic taste on some sips in the beginning.

A very fine representative of the barley wine style, even if the beer is a little on the sweet side.

Original rating (11-2005): 2004 vintage.  Very rich flavor.  Sweetness hits the tongue immediately.  A barley wine, cant be mistaken.  Reddish color.  Small head.  Can definitely taste the alcohol.

This tastes like a quality double or strong Belgian ale masquerading as a barleywine. As a beer, its quite nice. Its aroma is malty, slightly alcoholic and classic Belgian-yeast-nutty. Lightly roasted malt, Belgian-like yeast nuttiness, medium  hop bittering and a smidge of alcohol round out the flavor profile. Not much fruit notes for a barleywine. Fairly substantial palate. Pours a clear copper-brown with thin white head. Except for the ""old"" in the name, I never would have figured this to be a barleywine.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

3659,"2005-10-02",4.6,"2003 Vintage: A red-hued, brown head on a deep-colored, reddish brown body.  Strong barleywine aroma.  Saturated Saturation.  As much of everything as possible.  It is not layered in complexity, but in-your-face to the point I feel if they added one more pound of malt or one more ounce of hops the beer would collapse upon itself.  Flavor is not like the aroma entirely.  The high alcohol lightens and elevates the palate, making it dangerously drinkable (it is not a hot alcohol though).  The beer is big malt with just some acidity and hop flavor balancing but mainly on the roof of the mouth.  This leads into hops and malt flavor equalizing but competing with the unyielding, drying, mildly astringent alcohol then finishing with the taste of a fresh baked, molten, chocolate brownie.  This is a summary of my overall impression of this beer, but it does not do it justice.  Every taste from the glass changed like a chameleon with new complexities rearing their head then repressing themselves with the next taste.  My best analogy would be that of a perfectly grilled hamburger where all of the components: cheese, lettuce, tomato, and burger, are all in perfect balance but maybe the next bite the cheese is just a little thicker in that spot but it still tastes wonderful...wonderful but different.  A great way to finish the evening.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","AlchemistZ"

Sadly, this beer is still too young to be considered a masterpiece, theres plenty of alcohol warmth. Still, even fresh it is a fine sipping barleywine.

 got this at State Line Liquors in Elkton, MD. I should have gotten more. It had a heavily malted aroma and it seemed like an English ale by its red color until I drank it and discovered another work of art by North Coast. I taste a heavy dose of caramel and sense a slightly pungent finish which basically was the beer yelling at me to age it more. It seems like it would be great with sea food. Its great with anything!","East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","JFURYCAT"

3659,"2005-05-29",3.4,"2004 bottle. Deep reddish brown color with not much head; many high-alcohol beers lack this quality so I wont hold it against them. Aroma is quite malty with Middle Eastern fruit elements such as fig and date. There is a bit of hops in the finish. Flavor is ok, but perhaps a beer of this type should be given a chance as an uncarbonated brew and classified as an Old Ale. As it stands, its ok for a barleywine but at this high alcohol level the carbonation is somewhat cloying and tends to bring alcohol to the fore.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","BeerAteHer"

Fresh clean bready malt, stewed fruit and a soft spicy/earthy hop finish. This is an amazing product. Bright and fruity and awesome. Even young, this beer is amazing. 


2006 from a 12 oz bottle.  Very deep dark garnet with a fine laced yellowish head.  Sweet malty aroma, plums/dates and raisins with a sweet orangey hop note as well.  Brown sugar, molasses and toast.  Immensely sweet aroma but also with a tropical fruity character ove the back.  Flavour is sweet but also remarkably balanced for such a young and strong barley wine.  Malts with plum and other dried fruit, a bit of leather and earthiness as well as some prominent licorice flavour.  Toast and burnt sugar flavour.  Fruity hops, strong bitterness and alcohol but its not out of control.  Warming softens it even more bringing some soft toffee/caramel forward amongst the fruity, sweet hops.

Tap @ Blind Tiger.  Deep burgundy-red colour with a  thin white head.  Very sweet sugary, malty aroma.  Brown sugar, molasses, licorice, cherry.  Very vineous with a touch of acetic character.  Flavour is also very malty, molasses, brown sugar, and a bit of ethanolic pepper.  Treacly body becomes cloying.  A bit of peaty character.  Good, but too young.

2004 bottle
Hazy, cloudy dark brown beer with purplish highlights and no head to speak of.  The aroma is very plummy with lots of dried raisins, rye-like spiciness and some toastiness.  Soft alcoholic flavour helps dry out the sweet plummy maltiness that abounds in this brew.  Fairly spicy/resiny aroma and flavour.  Loads of fruitiness as well.  The beer is still very sweet even with two years on it, but it is also still very good.

Amber/Red colour. Big malty aroma of almonds and grass. Alcohol is sensed immediately. Toffee notes, slight licoricy, tidbits and above all, a nice sweetness.

The flavor is a little hot with alcohol and seems a bit unbalanced. Perhaps I will get a couple to cellar and see what happens. This was straight from a cold fridge so the aromas and flavors will improve as it warms, but initially it tastes a little rough: strongly malty with a sweetish, sticky mouthfeel.

Big sweet malty aroma, an odd hop scent I have not smelled before and a bit of alcohol as well as a touch of fruit like a bitter plum.. smells great.
A rich creamy full bodied palate a tiny bit of carbonation.
The flavor has a bit of well masked alcohol after the swallow comes off as a big sweet malt, a bit of carmel, hints of like a carmel apple and some raisens.  Overall a great beer to sit back and drink w/ a friend or by myself.

3659,"2005-03-08",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 11, 2010 2003 vintage. Deep brown color with tons of bubbles and a thin head.  Very rich aroma.  Flavor is smooth and well rounded. Tastes like it has aged and mellowed quite nicely.  I really liked this. 

RERATE: 2004 bottle.  2 years old. Deep brown/red color. The head of tight white bubbles only appears briefly with a vigorous pour. Aroma is huge; dark fruit, alcohol, sweet candi, a little sour.  I love to smell this beer.  The flavor is intense and mellow at the same time.  The body is just about right. This is definitely an english style barleywine and a delicious one at that.

2004 bottle consumed in 2008 aged. The pour reveals that there is minimal carbonation left. The head consists of only one or two clumps of tiny bubbles. Aroma is incredibly rich and carmelly. There is some alcohol, but its not aggressive or offensive. Really sophisticated beer. 8/3/8/5/18 

2004 Bottle consumed 2/12/09 over 4 years old.  The beautiful malts of the 2004 vintage have held up fantastically.  I really loved this year.  Its smooth and easy to drink compared to the newer hotter brewings.  Bring back to 2004 recipe!!!! 6/4/8/5/17

2004 Bottle consumed Jan 2010. There is a noticeable amount of alcohol in the nose and the caramel has reduced. Im worried that too much age is a real possibility. The flavors have thinned and flattened out. There isnt much life left. 2 years old was probably ideal.

2006 vintage consumed 11/06: Brown color with a ring and spotty drabs of head. Aroma is malty and actually whiskeyish. Flavor is alcoholic and much like whisky. This needs time.  A lot of time. 6/3/7/4/17.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","shadey"
3659,"2005-03-04",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2008 Bottle:  Nice sweet aroma.  Caramel, raisin, toffee, fruit, banana bread, whiskey and light alcohol.   Pours a dark brown with some orange hilights.  
Almost no head.  Basically a white ring around the edges.  Sweet and malty with a raisin apple finish.  Nice alcohol warming affect.  LIght hops in the finish.  Going to sit on a few of these for a while.  9-4-7-4-15

Sample this again on 11-9-05 and 8 months has really made a difference.  Nose is about the same with some added chocolate and less whiskey.  Large off-white head this time that lasts for a minute or so.  Flavor has changed significantly.  Chocolate and caramel are the leading flavors.  Light raisin is still there with some other fruits, but absolutely no apple.  Alcohol warmth is still there, but much more subdued than my initial sample.  More carbonation this time.  Finishes with some light bitterness that was not there last time.  Outside of aroma, seems like a completely different beer than I remember. Excellent.  9-4-8-4-18
04’ Bottle sampled 10/29/08:  Excellent aroma with lots of chocolate/cocoa, caramel, whiskey, and a hint of alcohol.  It pours a bright transparent orangish-red with a small off-white head that quickly fades to a ring around the edges of the glass.  The flavor starts with a big dose of chocolate that turns to moderate caramel.  The finish has a hint of fruit and faint whiskey.  The alcohol is barely noticeable.  Full bodied with a soft and slightly syrupy mouthfeel.  It just gets better and better with age.  9-4-9-4-19","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

At first glance a rather ugly beer, but the more I stare- there is something indiscernably appealing in its appearance. Truly picturesque. Like Im looking at an artists conception of a beer. Or Im just very thirsty. Taste matches the aroma, although in reverse order with a clean dry finish. Hops more present in taste than in aroma. Big smooth body.

3659,"2005-02-02",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 23, 2007 2006 On tap at Zenos Pub - State College, PA. Aroma of rich, dense sugars licked with spicy grandeur, lifting hop residue and rich alcohols. Pours a mixed ruddy and brown, with sweeping bronze fringes and a silky soap of off-white on tap. Flavor is thick, lubricious and bold. Theres amazing runs of nuttiness, complex mature fruits, bold spice and lively warm banana flesh. This is really expressive, dense and nuanced. Im really impressed! Awesome character on a curt and slightly alcoholic body, that leaves mostly dry and imparts a great spicy smack of beautifully aging Fuggles. Really awesome at this point. So much character, depth, flavor, build and expressive. Smack carries for ever with mature alcohol soaked woods, raw sugars and reminiscence of hops. Really awesome beer at this point.

STRONG flavor that doesnt stop after you swallow.  The aftertaste is actually just as strong as the beer itself.  A sign of a great brew in my opinion.  I know the alcohol is there, but the taste doesnt reflect it as much as the aroma.  The label tells me otherwise.  I bet they will get better with age and I look forward to drinking them later in life.

Update 05/21/05 - Just got a 4 pk of the 2002 from Khans on Keystone in Indy.  This is even smoother than I remember.  I feel that they shouldnt even sell this beer until they age it at least two years.  It has all the strong characteristics I described in my first rating, but is even better due to the smoothness.  I still plan on aging this even more to see if it can possible improve.Update 01/29/07 - Drinking another 2002 and I feel it has finally peaked or past that.

The ensuing flavor is sensational: sweet and fruity up front (grape, plum, black cherry), leading to a bit of roasted bitterness, finally giving way to a delicate whiskey finish.  The whole flavor had an unidentifiable spicyness to it that I really enjoyed.

I never even noticed since I was really blown away by how smooth, gentle, and warming this ale was.  It has incredible depth and really has one of the best sweet malt tastes I have had.  I feel this blows away Old Rasputin.  Also, it has great smell and apperance.  An excellent choice, I am extremely pleased, this was an awesome ale.","USA","Loddeer"

3659,"2004-10-05",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2005 Two vintages to rate, however the scores are for the 2001.2003 Vintage: - Orangey-brown headless horseman with all the smooth sweet barleywine characteristics I was looking for. Aromas of caramel and some fruit but also alcohol. Sadly the fear that arose when alcohol was so evident in the aroma came true - an alcohol burn emerged quickly in the initial taste and stayed through thte finish. Very tasty but too young.2001 Vintage - same initial impression visually but less alcohol on the nose. Maltier but not to the point the hoppiness disappeared. Much smoother than the 2003 and the alcohol takes much longer to make itself known. Could age more but was delicious now. Cheers to radiomgb for bringing this to one of our barleywine nights.","Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA","beerhugger"
3659,"2004-10-05",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 7, 2004 There is a thin quickly dissipating head with strong initial aromas of plum, brown sugar, and a hint of alcohol. It has a beautiful deep amber colour, and is quite cloudy. The first sip is immense, powerful flavour overtakes the senses. It feels very sticky, and stays on my tongue and lips. There are many different flavours, making it hard for me to pin-point them. It finishes with a nice little bite of alcohol. Truly an excellent beer.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"
3659,"2004-10-05",3.3,"I wish I would have read this description before drinking, because I would have aged this one a bit. Mine was a mahogany color, with a tiny head and good lacing. Big malty aroma. The flavor was young and sweet. I had no idea this was 11.4%, as the alcohol was not evident in the flavor profile.  A little to sticky and harsh, I can imagine it being really nice in a year or two.","Arlington, Texas, USA","jzzbassman"
3659,"2004-10-03",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2005 Pours a beautiful deep burgundy with a modest white head that self terminated rather quickly and left very little lace. Usually this prevents the appearence score from being high but the color on this beer was so damn pretty. When held up to the light the beer casts red lazers throughout the room. 

Dried Plums, trampled cherries, sweet raisins, malts, brown sugar and alcohol present in the aroma. Smells hefty and complex!

Starts out with plums and caramel then faids into a harsh alcohol bite but since it is woven with so many other flavors it is extreamly pleasant and warming. Sweet malts, brown sugar, dark fruits, molasses, and dried apples are intertwined with the alcohol bite to produce something that just simply tastes exquisite.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
3659,"2004-09-30",4.1,"A downright gorgeous dark ruby body glows in the light. The yellowish tan head forms easily, but soon fades. The fading head is a bit of a disapointment, but what a gorgeous color the body is. The aroma is thickly malty with occassional whiffs of milk chocolate. Theres a hop bitterness that tingles the sinuses a bit, but its held in check to be a balancing note instead of overly dominate. The malt alternates between bread and that phantom chocolate with streaks of hop bitterness to break it up. A good bit of oak comes through toward the late middle. Awesome barleywine.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
3659,"2004-09-27",3.9,"I had a vintage 2001 bottle, bought and enjoyed in September of 2004.  It poured a dark orange/brown color with a thin but sustained tan head.  The aroma, spicy and nutty with sweet malt rising to the top.  Strong alcohol presence in this thick drink, but the heaviness of the sweet mouth-feel made it slide down easily.  Nice warm finish.

3659,"2004-09-17",3.9,"Vintage Bottle 2003, Sampled September 2004
Pours a pretty, clear, deep ruby color and is topped by an amber-tan creamy head.  The aroma is heady with rich notes of malt, caramel, malt extract.  The malt aromas are accentuated by hoppy notes of citrus, apricot, and orange.  The taste is full and sweet, and it coats my mouth in a fruity accompaniment that is caused by a marriage of citrusy hop notes and dark fruit malt notes.  This is pretty tasty, with notes of plum, raisins, citrus, pine, sherry, leather, and caramel.  This beer is a good example of the Barley Wine style, it is perhaps weighted towards the hop end of the scale, but not so much that you cant easily pick out the rich notes that the malts bring to this beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3659,"2004-09-14",3.7,"HUGE, thick, golden-amber hued head that stays nice and long. A sweet aroma with elements of cinnamon, citrus and mixed fruit. This ale is seriously fun to drink.

3659,"2004-09-09",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 20, 2005 Bottled, 2003 edition. What can I add to these raves? Its just some kind of mad beer. Pours a ""bright"" brown that doesnt make you think of barley wine just yet. Nice tan head on top. Mouthfeel is sticky, even for a barleywine, and rough like a buckwheat honey. This is full of rough edges, yet I wanted to savor every one of them. Couldnt figure the malt presence, but toward the end of the sample, my upper lip was curled slightly inward.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
3659,"2004-09-07",3.7,"Ruby red, crystal clear liquid was topped with a small foamy head that did not last. The aroma was sweet and malty with honey, raisin, cherry, and vanilla notes. The taste was rich, with warm alcohol reminiscent of port wine or rum, buttery toffee, roasted nuts, and brown sugar. The mouthfeel was dry and roasty with a distracting peppery alcohol afterburn. The aftertaste is also quite bitter.  This is definitely an after dinner sipping beer.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
3659,"2004-09-06",4.3,"2003:
Pours a red color with amber highlights. Carbonation is fine, but plentiful, and the head is a yellow/cream color. Lacing is sticky -- the head dies to a fine layer. Aroma is heavy malt and caramel with fruity esters and some real ?Juicy Fruit? notes. Mouthfeel is smooth, full bodied, thick and syrupy. Flavor is sweet at the start, caramel, with a blunt hop presence and a lingering but pleasant bite at the finish.

IMHO: Intense, but not over the top. A nice balance of characteristics -- not subtle. I would recommend this beer to the barleywine lover.","New Mexico, USA","igel"
3659,"2004-09-04",3.8,"Beautiful dark ruby body with some cloudiness. Off-white head is gone in no time leaving behind just a few swirls of milky way. One sniff tells you everything. Powerful, sweet malt, grapes, alcohol, peach and lightly of wheat.  Taste is strong and relatively thick for this style. Lots of grape, raisin flavors with intense malt matched by a very heavy roasted hop/coffee presence, alcohol, corn and a sweet finish. Its an excellent beer with a large dose of wonderful flavors but the overall palate is not as smooth/balanced as it would need to consider this a perfect beer. Also a short taste. This style usually lasts longer on the palate.","Cochabamba, BOLIVIA","JonR888710"

Flavor of soft but predominate caramel, roasted malt, coffee, a slight bit of bittersweet chocolate. Excellent malty barlywine. The sweet malt profile is just barely balanced by a slight hoppiness which ties to poke through the malt and leaves a slight cinnamony spiceyness. Alcohol is just bearly noticable on the finish, I would never guess it was over 9%. Very well used and hidden alcohol.

3659,"2004-07-27",4.5,"2003 - Bright mahogany color with a finger high firm head of pumpkin insides hue, lots of good lacing in sheets and thick webbings.

Aroma is a whole lotta caramelized malt action which ensues with a pretty juicy and strong waft with a bit of alcoholic heat enriched within the malts. Its coming across more like a dopplebock. Malty rich with caramel for sure. Semi sweet, ripe and dark fruit notes of raisins soaked in cherry sauce and drizzled in toffee.

Flavors repeat the nose perfectly I think,....lots of caramel; smooth, dark, rich, thick, chewy caramelized malty goodness. Very round and full of malts. Chewy dark breads and dark fruits of cherry, fig, and raisin make for some slight mixing and are noticeable more closer to the finish. Hops still seem pretty juicy too with a slight fruity sense and oily resin but extremely tame on bitterness. The malts dominate here and by a good measure. Some slight alcoholic singes interweave within the caramel and help keep a slight burning or toasty warming aspect among the bigger gulps.

And gulping is what will happen with this tasty, full bugger, as it is quite laxed, full, creamy, and smooth with just the right warmth of alcohol. Upon first sipping this massively yummy concoction there is now way this has 11.4%, ahhh...but it does, so watch out. Nearly as good as my fav Bells Third Coast...this stuff is great when fresher, aging this stuff Ive found it mellows to much so... it changes by quite a bit.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

3659,"2004-06-22",4.3,"2003 Vintage, sampled on June 22 and probably again later in the fall.  Pours a nearly clear amber color with minimal head and no lacing.  After glass is tilted, a dozen or more bubbles with amble slowly out of the beer, making a pleasant sound and fun to watch.  Aroma is uplifting and mouthwatering; smells of fruits and roastiness much like a big, sweet stout, but has definite maltiness and alcoholic character  to the point of smelling like a fine spirit to be taken in a snifter glass like brandy or cognac, which would be my weapon of choice, but a tulip is the best I have.  The beer is HUGE, very alcoholic, very sweet and fruity, some mild mead flavor with a dry, mouthwatering and sweet and bitter alcoholic finish.  Much like a cognac and something that probably shouldnt be taken in 12oz servings as it is bottled.  At the brewery they do 6oz servings for a reason, I think.  Mouthfeel is dry on the finish.

3659,"2004-05-11",4.3,"Wow...now this is what I’ve been waiting for.  I bought six of these from our base liquor store.  I’d never heard of North Coast before so initially it didn’t get my attention.  I was curious, picked up a bottle and noticed the 11% ABV rating.  That tweaked my interest a bit.  Being a huge Rochefort (8 and 10) fan, I figured I’d give this a try.  Got home, did some research and thought this looks pretty good.  I was right.  This is a damn fine beer. I don’t detect much hops in the aroma, but I do get a strong sweetness offset by a wonderful malt smell.  The taste yields a nice, dominant sweet vanilla caramel feel....I like it..a whole bunch.  What a contrast to Sierra's Bigfoot BW.  I guess Old Stock can mellow, but believe me....the Bigfoot can use some mellowing.  Bigfoot is way short on sweet, but big on hoppiness.  There’s some hoppiness trying to get through, but it’s masked.  I like the color---a reddish, brown caramel hue.  Try as I might, I can’t induce any real head on the pour.  The alcohol is evident in the taste, and aftertaste---a nice little burn.  Hmm...any hops here?  Yep, at the end....a nice hop bitterness---not slam in your face, but very appropriate.  I have to note that this bottle was a bit too chilled.  As it has warmed in my glass I’ve noticed an increased volume in all aspects.  The hops are coming on more. The NC folks say age will do this ale good.  Sounds great by me, but I doubt I can wait very long.  A very, very, nice ale.  I just ordered some NC Rasputin.  I’m thinking I should get on it and order me some Old Stock ASAP.  I’m sure there’s better ales in the Barley Wine category, but there ain’t a darn thing wrong with this one.

Smells very impressive. There's a sweetness there that isn't just malt. Serious fruit presence as well.

Taste is overshadowed by the alcohol. Toasted fruits and malt sweetness predominate with virtually no hop presence. The flavor is good but it could be better.

Mouthfeel is of alcohol. Other than that it's typical for style; not overly full and not a lot of carbonation. Drinkability suffers from the unbalanced taste and the high alcohole content.

Dark murky mahogany. Light tannish head that reduces quickly into a filmy layer on the surface with a ring of head on the side of the glass.

Medium to Heavy-bodied; Sweet initial flavours turning into an alcoholic burn and then a spicey dry finish. Aftertaste shows a lot of alcohol and not much else. Overall, nose and appearance are great, but too much alcohol and not enough other flavours are noticeable in the taste.

Great, thick mouthfeel, but not syrupy.  Flavor was a very focused, with an emphasis on pure sweet maltiness, with some trail mix undertones, minus the salt.  A touch of bitterness to balance on the finish, and an armagnac tinged warmth of alcohol.

Chestnut red with a slight haze. It pours with a minimal tan head that remains as a thin ring of foam around the sides of the glass. No lacing to speak of. A somewhat nutty, plum scent dominates the aroma. Just a wonderful toasted malt smell. The taste is sweet as expected, but again the nutty component is very prevalent. Nice plum and cherry fruits appear, along with a biscuit malt flavor. Some hops clean up the finsh, and present a lingering bitterness.

Extremely thick and syrupy, hard to swallow its so damn thick.  Amazingly complex.  Combined flavors of port, honey and brown sugar under a big hoppy plum profile.  Even being somewhat new and unaged I thought it was wonderful.  Having a 2 year aged bottle of the 2002 presents a more syrupy, stuffy and thick barley wine that, when compared side-by-side with Bigfoot (1 year aged) and Batch 6000 (1 year aged) it comes up in third and last place.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3659,"2003-07-11",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2006 2002 bottle consumed 7/2003 This was my first experience with a newborn barley wine.  It goes without saying that it needs cellaring.
Color is a deep ruby red mixed with mahogany.  Strong perfume like aroma due to the high alcohol with plenty of sweet caramel notes.
  Huge sweet caramel malt taste up front that evens out slightly as it transitions into a full body with tons of more malted barley.  Finish is most complex and therein lies the potential of this beer.  Brandy and caramelized sugar notes abound, while some rich butter toffee notes linger.  Leaves a bitter/grainy almost scotch malt flavor for an aftertaste.  This barley wine was lacking on hops compared to some of the other upper tier barleys.  This is not at all a bad thing, as it certainly gives Old Stock a unique flavor, which is a must in this category (though I wouldnt mind some hops).  There is little point in drinking this beer newly bottled, and it is close to cloying, as expected.  I will rate on potential, of which this beer seems to have alot.  I expect good things from the many bottles I am cellaring. 2002 bottle consumed 12/20/03.  Well its been sitting in cellar for a while now, almost a year.  Much improved.  Cloyingness is almost nonexistent.  Great velvety lush mouthfeel.  Wonderful complexity.  This is aging beautifully and will probably improve for another some years.
2003 bottle sampled 10/04.  Wow. this is hard to finish. Incredible alcohol apparency and big dry malt, but still the flavor is there, its quite the sipper.  I already know it needs more time to even out so Im not too distressed about the difficulty with this one.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

I prefer an 2-3 year old bottle everytime.Original Review (3.7), 2001 bottle: Murky, earthy brown hue, the white head died quickly. Raisin, woody, sherry like aroma when undertones of sweet malts and yeast. Initially comes on very sweet and fruity with a detectable alcohol bite.

At first, there was a medium thick beige head, but once the beer warmed a bit the head was completely gone...no trace of it at all. The aroma was heavy on the plums...very sweet, alcohol, caramel.

Enticing aroma of dates and/or raisins and other fruits, toasty (or sort of burnt) caramel, hops and of course alcohol. The clever trick offered by the brewer here is that this attempt at making a very strong, bold, full-bodied version of this complex style is accomplished without assaulting you and sternly testing your conviction; IOW its surprisingly drinkable *for a Barley Wine*. All the elements are there but restrained or subtle compared to some other examples. Very enjoyable to savor on a cool evening.","Laguna Niguel, California, USA","elnadeau"

Excellent color of deep, dark mahogany.  Wonderful, complex aroma with hints of spice, plums, alcohol, caramel, toffee and other aromas.  Wow, letting this warm up before drinking really brings out the alcohol presence.  Very warming.  Rather thick and syrupy.  A little on the sweet side. Reminds me of drinking NyQuil.  Flavors not as complex as the aroma but notes of caramel and light fruit.  Finish is smooth and creamy and coats the mouth.  Bit of bitterness present.  Not a brew for the weak of heart and definately not a brew if you are looking to quench your thirst.  More like a brew that can substitute as a good sleep aid.

The aroma is definitely active with grapes, cranberry juice, peaches, alcohol, purified water, vanilla, almonds and sweet malts apparent. The taste is much of the same as bitter acetic peaches and sweet caramel and vanilla malts caress the palate and balance each other nicely. Definite alcohol bitterness yet somehow no alcohol til the aftertaste...somewhat hard to describe.

Flavor is very malty(crystal/caramel) with hops very close behind as well as alcohol and fruitiness.  Very well balanced for a big barleywine, hop flavor seems to be very low compared to malt and alcohol, but finishes a little on the dry side for a big beer.

Weak metallic aroma, whiffs of malt and the slightest note of grape.  Slightly oily, slightly sticky, yet a bit thin all things considered; the cola-like carbonation on the palate is lost early on.  Flavor is the strong suit here, full and rounded across a range of English strong ale qualities with a bit of Scottish ale in there.  Spicy notes--growing with time to be a sharply biting presence, hitting the tip of my tongue as it goes into my mouth and making me shout ""whoa Nellie!""--more metal, and a biting alcoholic flavor.

The beer as it sets in the glass translucent incarnadine color with a modest and semi-creamy head that is a winsome light tan in color as it passes out of existence rather quickly; the remnants form a somewhat patchy sheet of lace to cover the glass. The aroma of sweet malt, a ripe plum or maybe better yet raisins also present, the every present fresh, clean and crispness also noticed, not a bad thing, just cant find a better way to describe the nose with the front quite sweet, thickly malted, the top also rich in its feel to the palate. Finish is moderately carbonated, the hops pleasing in their bite, spicy but not overly so, aftertaste desert dry. The big thing is the huge Tummy Warming sensation from the 11.4 percent ABV, oh how I love this beer and have a case in storage, but alas only two 2002 releases left as this beer is an overwhelming favorite when Im in the mood to Rock My World!

I must be losing what little Brain Cells I have left as I swear that I have sampled this beer several times, yet no where in my extensive list of notes can I find it? Oh well, another bad boy barley wine to sample.

The beer as it sets tempting me to drink it before its time is up, is a transpicuous deep ruby red, the head sententious, the lace fine sheets of lace to coat the glass. The aroma of fine malt, lightly sweet, clean and fresh, hints of butter, quite pleasant. Begins malt and quite sweet, the top thick-bodied, with the finish peacefully carbonated and the hops delightful in the spiciness, malt dry and long lasting alcohol bitter aftertaste, a Wolf in Sheeps Clothing as the high ABV sneaks up on you and warms the tummy, a fine Winter Warmer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

3659,"2002-07-12",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2003 2001 bottling.  Pours with an almost inexistent head but a slight amount of visible effervescence.  Deep garnet color, mostly clear.  Some light alcohol and some surprisingly delicate, sweet malt fruitiness in the aroma.  Fairly sweet flavor as well overall, with some nice caramel and toffee, brown sugar and a somewhat sticky yet effervescent  mouthfeel.  Finish sees the hops at last, and I've discovered I have somewhat of an affinity for the Fuggles hop variety.  This is a good barleywine, but I have a feeling it would turn into a great one if laid down for a couple of years or so, allowed to attenuate a bit further.  At this point in time, it seems to lack that overwhelming complexity that I am so fond of.  Still, it's a very classy brew and I did enjoy it.  

Update: 12/15/03.  Same 2001 vintage, but seems to have developed profoundly vinous characteristics.  Bitterness has also, unsurprisingly, diminished somewhat, revealing some tobacco and red grape aspects.  Palate has smoothed out nicely.

3659,"2002-07-01",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2010   Strong brandy/fruity aroma that had me expecting greatness. The beer is good, but not in the league of Third Coast Old Ale or Behemoth by any means. Fruity malt that develops into a sort of burnt caramel finish. This huge beer is amazingly well balanced, as none of the alcohol seems to come through in an overwhelming manner. However, the flavor of the finish was just a bit off. Better as it warms, and hopefully even better with another year or two under its belt. Time will tell.  
Retaste, 2/10: Headless and pours thick after over seven years in the cellar. Sweet caramel malt with banana fruit undertones has held its own over that time, finish is smoother and alcohol is covered well, a bit of residual sugar lingers with a hint of smokiness.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"

Delicate fruity hops, tropical fruits (at warmer temp),pepper, rich caramel, figs, brandy?, brown sugar, fruitcake, alcohol, and toffee.  Very enticing and sweet.  Attractive creamy lace with excellent stick power.  The palate hits you so elegantly, yet with a simultaneous aggressive syrupy tinge and round creaminess.  The high gravity is highly involved in this highly distinguishable palate.  Grainy texture adds just another extent to the palate.  Flavors of raisins and caramel.  Finishes long and sticky.  An hour and a half later:  far stickier, creamier, and a longer finish with coffee being introduced and caramel becoming much more pronounced.  This is clearly centered around the luscious malts; becoming more slick and luscious toward the end of the glass.

The head is very small, almost nonexistent in my glass, but the color is a nice deep amber.  The taste is totally intense---sweet, almost cloying at times, with lots of malt and some hops too, but not as much as I expected.  In that respect, this reminds me more of a concentrated Fullers Vintage rather than something like Old Foghorn.  In other words, I wouldnt know this was a barley wine unless someone told me.  I expected much more hops here, especially given the commercial description.  I love the taste, but yet I dont.  To be honest, it reminds me of cough syrup---the strong, alcohol-based kind.  I dont mean that in a bad way, believe it or not.  In this mixture, it works, at least to a large extent.  There isnt any really hoppy bitterness in this except a brief, sharp moment before the alcohol takes over and numbs everything.  It only becomes sweeter as it warms, and a bit more viscous.  I like it...alot...or maybe its the alcohol talking from the bottle I just finished, but I definitely have not tasted anything quite like it before.

3659,"2001-11-24",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2009 Oh, my. And after I just got through slurring North Coasts craftsmanship for one of their other offerings.  Nose is very grape-alcohol (grappa, brandy?) Deep, clear ruby amber with no head.  Flavor is very winey, and the Fuggles means that you need to drink it on the warm side.  A distinctive beer with a distinctive crank to it.  Addendum:  I just opened a 2001 vintage Old Stock, in April 2009.    There was a bit of semi-flocculent  white precipate - probably protein drop -  the beer has withstood the test of time.  Sometimes in an un-airconditioned Florida garage, but in the fridge for the past 3 years.  Even so, it is a rich, quality brew.   This is a testament to the fact that beer cellared in the dark, apparently regardless of the heat, and can last for a good long time.  Age seems to impart a vanilla quality to just about all beers.
