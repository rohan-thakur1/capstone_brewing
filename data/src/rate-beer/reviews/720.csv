720,"2017-04-14",3.4,"22-ounce bottle pours clear amber with a small light tan head with no lacing. Aroma: toffee, dark bread, nuts, malt, faint hops. Flavor: bubblegum, caramel, caramelized brown sugar, layers of maltiness that is hard to pinpoint -- due to the grain bill of barley, wheat, millet, buckwheat, oats and triticale.

720,"2017-03-13",3.6,"Two things you never want to see next to each other on a beer bottle: a born-on date from eighteen months ago, and ""DRINK FRESH"" on the labeling. So, safe to say, Im not approaching Grainiac under optimum conditions. But damned if that liquor store didnt have a large selection of old Stone beers for super-cheap, and damned if I didnt buy a wide variety of them. So now, aged Grainiac: malt-bomb is right, at least as far as the nose goes; huge toffee-caramel malts with underlying booze and a grainy earthiness I cant quite place. Pour isnt all that pretty, dark brown but with little head and lacing and a worrying amount of particulate swirling around the pint. Taste opens up with a syrupy smack of malt, caramel and honey and sweet tea, growing a strange, rye-like tang on the back end. Nutty middle fades into a oat-cluster sweetness on the finish, offset by a firm dry hoppiness once likely a source of citric complexity but now flat pine. Fade is bready and full, like a honey-slathered piece of 12-grain loaf covered in pine needles. Textures remarkably smooth and easy, even if theres an unexpected boozy heat for an 8.5% brew. Not bad. Wish I couldve tried it fresh.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

The appearacne is a rich and polished mohagany/amber with an off-white head of creamy foam. The aromas open with caramel, toffee, sweet bread, some fruitfullness similar to peaches and light plum. The hops are reserved until the end where they alter sweet fruit toward slightly tart and dry for an all around enjoyable revolution.

I know that this beer is mostly about the malt bill but the hop presence is severely muted, hurting the overall aroma. Slightly earthy with some grassy resins but the nose of this beer is pretty bland. Very surprising for a Stone beer. Grainy with malted barley, subtle roast, dark bread and light sweetness. Caramel, toffee, blonde coffee, lightly charred toast and faint smokiness. Pretty boring.

Fuller body than expected and only slightly more interesting and flavorful than the nose suggests. Hop presence stands out a bit more with dry, sticky bitterness up front lingering over the heavy malt backbone into a dry finish. Grassy resins with pine sap and kind bud but again, the malts are the star here. Interesting balance of roast, earth and sweetness with hints of tobacco, leather, toast, lightly roasted coffee, oatmeal, caramel and chocolate. Slight boozy heat/sweetness on the finish. Overall, this beer is pretty odd. The hops show up more on the palate than in the aroma but are one dimensional, dry and bitter. The malt bill is intense but not all that complex which is surprising considering they used seven different grains. Not unpleasant, just kind of boring and slightly harsh.

720,"2015-12-09",3.8,"22oz bottle, from Dutchs. Shared with Chris R, alexsdad06, and tmoney99. Up front in the nose, theres a surprisingly big amount of citrusy grapefruity hop. The malt bill is indeed rich, bready, kind of like a touch of rye or multigrain, but with a lot of hop over top. Its interesting. I dig it, especially now while its fresh with the big hop. Not sure how it would be once it ages a touch and the hop fades, but very nice balance as of now. Mostly clear red orange color. Thin off-white head, with some decent splotches of lace. Medium to bigger body. Drinks a bit lighter than 8.5%. Smooth, kind of soft, lighter carbonation. Moderate-plus bitter taste, light to moderate sweet. I dunno, its pretty tasty. I dont think I would have minded enjoying a whole bottle of this with one of my sandwiches.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
720,"2015-12-07",3.4,"Pours a deep golden brown on tap with fluffy off-white head that dissipates to leave moderate lace. Aroma was mostly malty sweetness to me with maybe the slightest hint of pine on the back end. Taste is all malt, no hops there for me, a bit of booze to round it out. This series has not been very exciting for me.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"
720,"2015-12-06",3.4,"Poured from a bottle. Deep ruby color. Thin khaki head. A good amount of lacing. Fruity aroma with a little bit of pine thrown in. Taste of raisins and bitter grapefruit. One of the better Stochastcity releases.

720,"2015-12-05",3.2,"Pours a ruby amber color with a thin khaki head. Hop, grain, caramel, toast, biscuit and raisin aroma. Raisin, toast, caramel, biscuit, grain and molasses flavors. Medium light body and moderate carbonation. Caramel, molasses and grain finish. Body is a bit this and its a bit more bland than expected with the malt bill.","California, USA","beertholomeus"
720,"2015-12-04",4.1,"Bottle from Ayottes
Deep copper with a beautiful reddish hue ans a bubbly creamy off white head that persists. Citrus and pine on the nose with bits of cereal earthy almost nutty maltiness with just a touch of burnt caramel. Rich cereal nutty earthy maltiness with plenty of c hop flavor to counter. Smooth bitterness. Different beer to be sure, but I enjoyed the hell out of it.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
720,"2015-12-02",2.8,"Pours a rich Amber color with a malty aroma. Taste is very dry and grainy. Flavors of hay, grass and a small nuttiness left on the palate after the swallow.","Diamond Bar, California, USA","Barreras"
720,"2015-12-02",3.7,"Deep mahogany pour with a frothy white head. Lots of sweet caramel, resiny hop, cereal, bready aromas jump from the glass. Flavors focused on the cereal type grains with some caramel, slight bittersweet finish that didnt last, touch of roast and bread. Maybe some wood in the backend. Mouthfeel was medium plus. A fun beer with lots of malt complexity and a punch of hops. Good stuff.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","mixmasterob"
720,"2015-11-30",3.9,"Pours deep mahogany into a tulip. Off-white head with good retention recedes leaving sheet lacing. Pepper and resin aromas. Sweet millet and pumpernickel upfront turning to hot resin and aged pit fruit before the lasting roasted nut and pith finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
720,"2015-11-28",3.9,"pretty much exactly what I though it would be - a strong hoppy slightly abrasive beer with a deep and complex malt profile. Nicely done.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
