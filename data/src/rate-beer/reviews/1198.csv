AROMA: Strong orange aroma, some alcohol. Some clean malty sweetness in the background. 10/12APPEARANCE: Flame orange hue, hazy body, visible sediment and CO2. Moderate off white froth leaves great lacing. 3/3FLAVOR: Orange flavor akin to sweet peel rather than bitter peel. Some sherbet or candy-like flavors. Bitterness is strong and dank, but not syrupy or resiny. There is a firm malty backbone, but it is not especially sweet. Alcohol is subtle. Well balanced. 17/20MOUTHFEEL: Medium-full body. Too thick to be crisp, but too carbonated to be syrupy. Alcohol warmth is minor and complements the palette. Very smooth and surprisingly quaffable (not a sipper). 5/5OVERALL IMPRESSION: An excellent overlooked DIPA.

1198,"2015-04-11",3.9,"Thanks Jesse. Date on the side reads 03/25/15
This was poured into a tulip. 
The appearance was a hazy burnt glossy orange with an ample amount of ruddy brown coloring. Soft stringy carbonation rides to the top in a moderate pace. Barely any head softens to some light bubbles riding the top of the glass. A light film of lacing sticks to the sides and gently falls.
The smell had a sweet to bitter blend citrus hops with a soft crisp apple arranging itself nicely in the mix.
The taste took the bitterness and the sweet to combine. A sticky sweet citrus aftertaste starts and lingers into a wet finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. A rapid bitterness wraps itself around my tongue to pound into submission.
Overall, I say this was a really nice DIPA. I liked that initial apple aroma that blended nicely. Id say a unique DIPA that I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1198,"2014-12-30",3.0,"22 oz bottle into a Chimay goblet.

A: Pours a dark copper color. The head is a finger off-white shade with poor retention. Its disappointing how quickly the head fades; though on the positive side, it does manage to leave a bit of lacing behind.

S: Right from the start, it brings the dank, citrusy hops in a big way. Citrusy, mainly - in fact, there are some solid tropical fruit notes emanating. Theres also some cat pee, which is never a bad thing in small doses. Maybe theres a bit more malt than I really prefer from the style, but this definitely succeeds as a total package.

T: The slight malt sweetness that hits first quickly gives way to an onslaught of bitter grapefruit rind. Make no mistake, this is hella grapefruity. It becomes maltier during the finish, displaying notes of caramel, dough, toffee, and brown sugar. My problem is that there isnt much to tie together the big grapefruit with the malt backbone. Its just like cosmicevan said, this is a really sappy, syrupy kind of beer - and thats not what I want from the style.

M: Well carbonated, enough to poke through the thick body - in fact, enough to overpower the palate, even. One feature I really like: hop resins seem to accumulate on the palate, bringing more and more bitterness as more is imbibed. Im torn between giving this a great score due to the hop resin or a poor score due to the rampant overcarbonation. Meh, Ill split the difference - its a bit unpleasant feeling at first, but once the carbonation slows down, it develops a nice (if too sweet) texture.

O: Im shocked this is a 100. SHOCKED I SAY! Okay, maybe not: this is a big ol grapefruit bomb, which means if you like big ol grapefruit bombs, youre going to really like this. Me, I only like them situationally (ie. Nugget Nectar), with my preference being leaner, less sweet DIPAs. As it stands, Im still disappointed by this. Dont avoid this, just curb your expectations.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

1198,"2014-12-06",3.8,"Deep very hazy golden and light copper coloured body with a nice, two centimetre tall microfoamed just off-white head. Aroma of nice crisp grapefruit and piney hops with a bit of alcohol, passionfruit, malt, caramel and sugar notes coming from the nose as well. Full-bodied; Rich malt body with a bright sweetness from fruit and a pungent but well-balanced hop bite showing pine and grapefruit predominately. Aftertaste shows some bright bitter qualities from the hops with a lot of sweetness, and a very nice mellow malty character that balances out nicely. Overall, a very nicely balanced, well flavoured and nuanced Imperial IPA with no cloying flavours nor pungency, but a solid alcohol presence, some light sweetness and a good option, not as great as I was expecting, but good, for sure.

1198,"2014-10-05",3.8,"The bottle has a faded stamp of ""8 12 14"" 12 AUG 2014? Just under two months old if this is the case.

Appearance: Fairly short white head that looks somewhat creamy with some larger bubbles in it. The body is a hazy orange and bronze color.

Aroma: I get a fresh cut grapefruit scent, a bit of a grassy aroma, and slightly catty. There is a bit of mango that peeps in every now and then too.

Taste: There is a rustic bread crust flavor right up front, followed by an earthy woody flavor. There is a bit of pine in the aftertaste. As the beer warms up a bit in he glass that pine character starts to dominate a lot more and becomes the primary flavor.

Palate: It has good bitterness without being overwhelming or difficult to drink. It sits in the medium body range with a good amount of malt backbone without feeling overly sweet. It does a very good job of highlighting hop bitterness but balancing (not equalizing) the malt character.

Overall: The beer was nice but it wasnt fantastic. There wasnt a whole lot of hop flavor presence in comparison to the overall bitterness of the beer. Perhaps that was the goal of the beer, given the name ""Bitter Valentine."" Its not a beer that will be on my radar in the future.","","teromous"

It pours a clear amber with a foamy white head.

Luckily though it is decently old (for an IPA) the smell is still there. It is definitely hinting more malty though. There is some sweet tropical notes and some citrus rind. The malt is sweet smelling with some bread and caramel.

The flavor is nice. Good hop flavors with a biting bitterness, it has no shortness of that. But I think the hops could be a bit better, more of a slap of citrus. This one is more of a pine one which I like, but it isnt really complex. The malt isnt as prevalent in the flavor but leaves a bit of a balancing sweetness.

1198,"2012-03-15",3.6,"From notes. 

The beer itself is a transparent light caramel color with a bubbly off-white head that fades away as the glass progresses.  

There is a fair amount of bready sweetness in the nose to go along with a mainly grapefruit and pine hop bitterness.  There is some other tropical fruit as well.

This a well constructed East Coast DIPA, which I enjoyed, despite my preference moving away from that style toward the West Coast hop bombs.  There is a noticeable sweetness up front that I would guess is mostly pale malt with a bit of caramel malts blended in.  Citrus hops carry most of the flavor, with grapefruit bitterness being the strongest.  Spicy pine adds a kick toward the end.  Some pineapple and mango add a little bit more of a tropical fruit kick in the background.

For a DIPA, this has a fuller body and medium carbonation.  It is smooth and pleasant, with a smooth filtered feel.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

1198,"2012-03-12",4.0,"Picked this up in a trade. Very stoked to try this very highly sought after beer. 

A - Beautiful copper  and gold colored beer. Excellent clarity and really gorgeous. Half a finger of head was produced on a moderate pour. Nothing too impressive in that regards. The beer has solid lacing on the glass each swirl.

S - Nice big hop profile. Lots of pine, hop resin, citrus fruits like lemon and tangerine. Very fruity and very hoppy. Im getting a solid degree of dry hops as well. Smells exactly as a DIPA should.

T - Whoa. Gigantic hop explosion, lots of bitterness and very mind blowing. Im getting loads of hops on the front and back of the tongue. Theres a nice malty taste at the back of my tongue, lots of citrus on the front. 

M - 90% carbonation on a mouth swish which opens up more of the citrus profile. Lingering hop resin is a bit hard to deal with though.

O - Its like an amped up Hopslam or perhaps a bigger version of Heady Topper. It lacks the smoothness of Pliny or the drinkability of Daisy Cutter. Its somewhere in the middle but wicked impressive.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

From a 22oz. sample I now smell those same aromas, but now with a touch of cat urine, which isnt necessarily a detractor. Shimmering amber, medium yellow head. Orange peel, pine, and tangerine flavor. Alcohol well masked. Delicious, varied, and a good level of bitterness, but a bit resinous.

Aroma is sweet, too; hints of grass, pepper, and pineapple. Medium to full bodied, moderately carbonated. Very bitter flavor, lots of citrus (again: grapefruit, lemon, some orange), and pepper. Fairly astringent mouthfeel. Sweetness is mild and only present for an instant up front before the bitterness takes over; and a hint of sweetness peaks its head in the finish before long bitter aftertaste. Alcohol comes through just a little. Its good, a little ones-sided on the citrus-hops, but it does that part well. Edit: It improved as I drank it.","Washington DC, USA","brigg"

1198,"2012-03-05",3.0,"Fresh bomber.  The pour yields a mostly clear, dark orange-amber body with a small but dense cap of dusky beige froth.  Quickly collapsing to a bubbly outer edge with a thin center patch, the head yields sticky, tattered bands of lacing.  Immediately, the nose reveals what seems to be my newfound arch nemesis, Simcoe hops.  Their signature savory, meaty, catty aromas are off-putting.  Secondary notes of grapefruit are buried too far beneath to make a positive impact.  Hefty malts are driven by buttery toffee mostly.  While the flavor of Simcoe never seems to match the intensity of the generally unpleasant aroma, I do still get some meaty characteristics that I dont think should be present in a beer.  Grapefruit pushes forward a bit, bringing along its bitter pith and fruity rind, but again, it falls short.  Toffee again comprises the malt base, albeit fairly well attenuated and not overly sweet.  The palate is robust, yet relatively dry, with average carbonation and a warm, alcoholic, somewhat papery finish.  Overall, Id call this a cleaner, better-attenuated version of GUBNA, a beer I detest.  Not much of anything for me to come back for on this one.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

A: Pours a clear light copper color with a nice tall off-white head with loads of lacing and great retention. I think I got those colors right; its always so damn dark in this place.

T: The flavor does not let me down either. Great continuation from the nose with prominent tropical and citrus fruits giving way to a fairly-heavy bitterness. Just a touch of warming alcohol. Load of fruity hope smack my tongue around.

1198,"2012-02-24",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2012 651mL thanks to ksurkin. Pours clear, darker orange with a larger, yellow head. Soapier rather than rocky retention. Nice lace. Nose at first is fresh tropical fruits, slightly muted with too much soapy character. Decanting allows sweet honey and cantaloupe to emerge with vanilla and booze. Taste is nutty bitter, thicker, slightly slick with fatty macadamia nut. Quite the long, bitter finish. Palate is bit astringent, a bit butterscotch slick. 9% is well hidden. 2/24/2012 7/4/7/3/14=3.5651mL from the Foodery in Philly. Awesome, rocky buttermilk to yellow head with nice retention and sticky lacing. Nose is fresh tropical melon, meaty jackfruit and sweet cantaloupe. Fresh, tropical hop nose. Taste is more quenching, more elusive quenching butterscotch. Nutty astringency is gone. Finish is neutral at first, about to be a superlative DIPA but gets slightly piney and tree bark bitter/aggressive over time in a long finish. But overall, much improved over my first bottle.
Our first bottle half froze trying to quickly chill it down for a tasting. Maybe thats why it became overly bitter and nutty, but Ive had beers freeze before that turned out perfectly fine. Maybe these ironically fragile DIPAs cant handle such freezing. Whoops. 3/2/2012 8/4/7/5/15=3.9","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1198,"2012-02-23",4.2,"Crystal clear orange/copper pour with a magnanimous frothy white head. Nose isnt overly aromatic, but holds beautiful notes of fresh cheesy hops, tangerine, cedar and tamarack evergreen presence, grapefruit flesh, sage, pot, steaming bark mulch, and even touches of lighter floral components on the edges. Really interesting nose because it isnt nearly as big and vibrant as other IPAs, but good lord is it complex and balanced. Flavor brings more big earthy and evergreen hops with less citrus. Loam and spruce abound with some really good lemongrass bitterness about 4/5 of the way through the flavor. Im a bit torn on the mouthfeel because i love a good aggressive hop character with that lingering bitterness, but at the same time the fact that theyve rendered a 9% beer to taste like a sessionable 4% option is an otherworldly achievement. Really really good, and really cool because its just different from almost any other double IPA out there.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

1198,"2012-02-21",4.2,"Bottle from Grape and Gourmet. Bitter Valentine pours orangish color.  Very little head, if any at all is poured.  Nice clear pour. Little bit of lacing.  Decent carbonation as bubbles shoot to the top of the glass.

Now on a lot of big IPAs I like to let the bottle sit there and see if the aroma of hops pour out of the bottle.  A lot of really huge IPAs do this but with Bitter Valentine I really didnt get that.  So I picked up my glass and took a huge whiff and was greeted by a really nice tropical fruit aroma.  Citrus, grapefruit, apricot, mango, peach with a small bit of pine and a very little malt backbone.  This is mainly just a fruity aroma.  While very very nice for some reason I wanted more.  But dont get me wrong here, its fantastic.  Straight up West Coast style with some East Coast thrown in.

The fruitiness in the aroma hits first with the taste. Just a barrage of tropical fruit.  Good stuff.  Then mid palette the fruitiness cuts off and bitterness comes in.  Its a lovely taste and got better and better as I drank.  The taste matches the greatness of the aroma and you definitely cant say that about every beer.  This beer rings in at 9% like I said but it doesnt really show up at all.  Maybe a little bit of a burn on the aftertaste.
