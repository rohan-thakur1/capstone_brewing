3057,"2016-07-29",4.2,"Apparence : Terre cuite, reflets rouges vifs, très mince col brun sans rétention. 
Nez : Bourbon, Bourbon, alcool, boisé la première effluve ne trahit pas le vieillissement! On a par la suite des arômes de sucre grillé, de sirop dérable foncé et, oui oui, de sucre à la crème! Intensité très élevée. 
Goût : Bourbon, alcool, sucre grillé, un peu de fruits rouges du Bourbon, finale en amertume très contrôlée et alcoolisée. Très intense. 
Sensation : Effervescence moyenne à faible, picotement sur la langue, corps dense (sans être extrêmement dense), bonne chaleur dans la gorge et les joues, finale amère et alcoolisée qui perdure longtemps. 
Bref : Très intense, cette bière porte définitivement la marque du vieillissement en fut de Bourbon et ce, à plusieurs égards. Dabord, le nez ne fait aucun doute, on y retrouve du Bourbon, de lalcool et du bois. La bouche nest pas en reste non plus au niveau de ces saveurs et présente un équilibre beaucoup plus intéressant que la version originale concernant lalcool et lamertume. Cette dernière, particulièrement, est très bien domptée par le temps et se marie bien au reste des saveurs.

Goût : Ça décape le fond du pallet. Cest amer avec un côté terreuxm liquoreux, caramel. Le goût est également très alcoolisé, peut-être dû au vieillissement en barriques. 
Appréciation : La bière est très certainement difficile dapproche, mais au fil du temps, on lapprivoise. Cest sucré et amer à la fois. Lalcool est facilement reconnaissable, ce qui était peut-être à prévoir, mais un peu décevant pour mes goûts personnels.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"

3057,"2013-03-02",4.0,"341ml from Le Monde des Bières.
Appearance : Dark amber with small head. Not much lacing

Aroma : Nice rich raisins and resinous hops. Light herbal notes. Rich vanilla bourbon with caramel. Light oxydation.

Taste : Piny hops qith caramel and raisins. Light vanilla and light wood. Piny and resinous finish with caramel, vanilla, light alcohol and some wood bitters. 

Palate : Average carbonation, feels a bit thinner than the regular version maybe because of the woody notes and the spirit-y notes.

Overall : Really nice beer. The bourbon BA is not too powerful. The BA seems to add more persistence to the finish. Nice complex nose and taste.

3057,"2011-11-21",4.3,"In short: A rich, complex a fruity big beer with a restrained bourbon barrel presence.  Similar to AleSmith Barrel Aged Old Numbskull and almost as good.
How: Many times, from fresh on tap the day of release and bottles at various age until now 1.5 year after the beer release
The look: Opaque brown body topped by a medium beige head with medium retention leaving lots of lacings on the glass
In long: Nose is toasted sweet malts, lots of raisins and moderate bourbon notes.  Because of its strong fruity character this is a bourbon barrel aged barley wine that smells a bit like an Abt aged for a short period of time in bourbon barrels, and as such it very much reminds me of AleSmith Barrel Aged Old Numbskull.  Taste is rich caramelized malts, wood chips sensation, raisins, some other dark fruits, cherry pit, vanilla, raisin bread.  Some hops resin remains despite the barrel aging.  A bit of alcohol in the finish.  I could go on and on listing flavour elements in this beer, this is one hell of a complex beer.  Again, I cannot help but to compare this 1.5 year old bottle to the Barrel Aged Old Numbskull that I had a few days before.  A lot more similarities than differences between the two.  I slightly preferred the Alesmith but not by much.  This Solstice dHiver Réserve Spéciale is truly an underrated beer, probably because it comes in a 12oz bottles and it is not from an American brewery.  Call me a Quebec homer if you want but I really believe this beer is one of the best barrel aged Barley Wine ever made.

Plums, raisins, dates, but also a little cherry as well.  Smooth, rich, toffee and caramel malt.  Incredible soothing barrel notes with some light alcohol warmth that seems as if its bourbon.

Flavor is more fruity and big caramelized malts and oak, big toast, some molasses hints of maple, vanilla, brown sugar, dark crystal malts, sherry hint, soy hint, wood, oak, light bourbon and a very smooth finish- even though there is a lot of sweetness all around- it does not get sugary or cloying- it fades a bit in the end and lingers in the mouth just a bit.

3057,"2010-02-09",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2013 My Bottom Line:
This luxurious Barrel-Aged Barley Wine lathers licorice, dates and black cherries atop caramelized cereals and vanilla, leading to a warm and classy alcohol finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam floats atop the purple-tinged deep burgundy.
-The lively effervescence and generous residual sugars are perfectly balanced to create a rich but never heavy mouthfeel.
-The alcohol heat is important in the finish, emboldened by the barrel presence, tagging along resinous hops and their aftertaste.
-The barrel character and grain bill flavors are in unison. Tastes like this brew was meant to be aged in these barrels exactly.

3057,"2010-02-02",4.1,"Hazy dark brown pour covered by an impressive, initially large-bubbled beige foam which recedes to a tight, uniform cover with traces remaining all along the sides. Adorable toastiness from the malts remains a standout despite the obvious bourbon notes. Highly cakey nature, a spongey chocolate cake with maple icing. This has kept its rich consistency and more carbonation than most oak-aged offerings. From what Ive heard, it would be the result of a 3:1 blend with the oaked version: standard version since the oaked alone felt a little too much to the owners. I can certainly see their point in terms of mouthfeel and in terms of keeping the best parts of the standard. The result is that this is just as complex as the regular Solstive dhiver, but less forward on the beautiful grapey/fruity vinousness, less forward on the serious hop dosage and thus seemingly a bit sweeter, very ripe with an enhanced oak, smoke, butterscotch and vanilla flavour range. Combined with the aging, there is not much hop character left, but its borderline roasty character provides a sense of balance. This is quite the treat and my favourite new sweet beer in a long time.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
