1326,"2014-01-13",3.4,"Bottle, shared with Ian. Deep red amber, light golden head. Sweet bready caramel aroma. Flavours of breadcrusts, barley candy, raisins; sherry-like, sweet. Quite nice.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
1326,"2013-04-17",3.7,"I liked this quite a bit. Pours much darker than I expected, with a deep brown center with a nice viscosity to boot. Thick on the mouth feel, with lots of texture and boozy, malt latent undertones. Nice one.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","novels"

1326,"2013-01-23",3.5,"Sampled at an esbls.  Red brown and dark in hue.  A decent tan head.  This has Dcottosh notes.  Rich malts.  They are dry.  Light fruit.  Decent.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
1326,"2013-01-09",2.4,"Bottle and in Imperial pint glass: Mahogany hue with a fading fizzy head and some spotty lace. The aroma has a soapy note which is off-putting along with plenty of crystal and bready malts, some earthy yeast esters along with a bit of grassy noble hops. The taste again displays an off character of old wet bagged malts along with some apple and pear fruitiness, earthy tones, some smoke and light herbal hop bitterness. Pretty bland and needs more body and forceful malt notes IMO. The Old 1713 Scottish Ale was so much better than this.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1326,"2012-12-16",3.6,"Aroma is fruit/berries and malts.  The flavor is mildly sweet malts, berries/raspberries and a bready/smoothish finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"

1326,"2012-11-30",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2016 Slightly slippery feel in the mouth. A tiny bit of smokey peat. Something strange with the bitterness in the last drink from the glass, a little burnt. Other than that decent stuff. Serving: Bottle","Chicago, Illinois, USA","rubbishystuff"
1326,"2012-11-25",3.5,"Nice and balanced. Just make sure you start with it as the palate is not deep and the flavor does not extend outside of malt.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","burgy"
1326,"2012-11-09",3.6,"Dark copper pour with a light tan head. Aroma is roasted malt and light smoke.  Taste is roasted malt, caramel and a light smoke flavor in the body and in the aftertaste. Nice lacing.","Granville, Illinois, USA","GranvilleTim"
1326,"2012-11-03",3.8,"Pours a deep copper brown color with a very small film head. Nose has a fantastic malt nose with some very light earthy hops highlights. Lots of marris otter malt kick, some light chocolate, light peat but overall a very smooth malty nose. Flavor has some light burnt caramel malt sweetness with a touch of chocolate to sweeten it up. Brew finishes with a slight acidic bite that really accentuates the hefty toasted malt finish. Body is modest with a lot of fine carbonation, making it feel slightly thinner. Overall a really good brew. Tons of rich malty flavor, fitting the style perfectly. Great candidate for a session evening with friends.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"
1326,"2012-10-25",3.5,"Purchased at Binnys in Chicago, IL; enjoyed on a Thursday night prior to leaving the country for two weeks.  Appearance is a very dark, cola like brown, slightly clear, with a rich but creamy off white head that laces to the glass.  Aroma is pretty faint, mostly malty, bit of caramel, but mostly smells crisp.  Taste has a light bitterness and a malty finish, tastes like a session ale, not bad stuff but nothing exceptional.  One of the lower ones of this 15 part Two Bros series.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"
1326,"2012-10-23",3.6,"Dark dark ale.... thick head. Sweet taste. Ive not had a scottish ale before but based on this im pretty impressed. I expected this to be a little bit nuttier but i was throughly impressed. I would drink this again.","Lindenhurst, Illinois, USA","whiskeyrocks"
1326,"2012-10-21",3.4,"On tap. Dark brown body with a small white head. The aroma is spot on for the style. Peated malt with some roast and caramel. Flavor is pretty smooth and finishes nicely. Decent.","Joliet, Illinois, USA","monkeychugg55"

Taste of malt, caramel, toffee, and hops. This light to medium bodied brew is well balanced and goes down quite easy. Nice job.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","Headbanger"
