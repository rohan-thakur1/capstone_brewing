2690,"2017-05-28",3.7,"(On tap @ Mikkeller and Friends, Copenhagen, May 9/17) Pours black with a small tan ring of head. Aroma of molasses, dark fruit, Irish whiskey, umami, burnt sugar, roasted grain, subtle vanilla, maybe some spice, weird thing that recalls pub food - some strange sensory association?! Flavour is very sweet molasses, dark fruits, treacle, dark barley wine feel, wood, sweeter whiskey, light liquorice, some burnt grain but low roastiness overall. Spirit heat in the finish is all that really dries it. Medium-full body, a bit syrupy, soft carbonation. This is just too sweet relative to its roast for my tastes, the flavours are good but the drinkability low.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"
