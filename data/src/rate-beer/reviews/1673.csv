1673,"2017-05-23",3.7,"12 oz bottle poured, with much thanks to Greg for the bottle! Always fun to try these beers that I would otherwise never come across. Near black tour, a thin tan fizz head. Quite true to the style, a dry, dusty chocolate constant. A slight metallic note in both the aroma and flavor, but not enough to bother me. Some coffee notes, but light. Chocolate remains the solo dominant character here. A soft dough. A solid addition to the style here. Enjoyed this brew.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
1673,"2017-05-23",3.6,"Bottle in Seattle. Thanks Andrew! Dry bitter grain aroma. A slightly sweeter, brown sugar and lactic sip. Quite dark brown black body with dissipating tan foam. Nice dark nose. Great dry bitter body with a lactic backend. Lots of chocolate. This is nicely put together. Not bad.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
1673,"2017-05-23",3.1,"$1.50 single 12floz bottle (BOD: 01.26.2017) to a nonic glass. Its black with a glittering brown head to bedazzle me. I sense some kind of wood aroma from the roasted malt, and dirt in the aroma too. I find this stout to be more slick than dry, and tastes like hickory and black twizzlers. I give it a firm ok.","","balloonbuffoon"
1673,"2016-12-28",3.7,"12 ounce bottle courtesy of noted OT-Mer sethdude! Dark brown, thin foamy tan head, decent retention. Aroma of dry, roasted malt, dark chocolate, hints of mint. The taste is roasted malts, herbal hops. Thin-medium bodied, creamy, super dry, high carbonation. Nice.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
1673,"2016-12-07",3.9,"12 ounce bottle. Pours a very dark black color with amber tints when held up to the light, a small white head. A nutty and roast nose. A nice roast, some dark fruit, light metallic roast (which I love), some vanilla. Quite drinkable. Very good. My kind of beer.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
1673,"2016-11-25",3.4,"UPDATED: NOV 29, 2016 Bottle pour into shaker pint glass. Aroma is roasted malts, coffee--a bit ashy--with hints of chocolate. Appearance is dark brown with effervescent sparkle, finger-width light brown fizzy, thin head with poor retention, light lacing. Taste is sweet, roasted malts with bitter coffee--a little too far toward the ash--with hints of dark fruits, chocolate. Palate is medium bodied with average texture and roasted/ashy, bitter finish with light fruit. Overall, this swings a little too far to the ashy side which dominates the experience.","Fremont, New Hampshire, USA","tfontana"
1673,"2016-11-22",3.6,"Bottle from Greg (gregwilsonstl) -- cheers, buddy! This wears its straightforwardness like a badge of honor. No adjuncts, no coffee additions, just a classic, dark-malt-forward, dry stout. The result? One really nice, simple dry stout, with a malt sweetness and a hint of a roasted coffee bite, all on top of a thin, dry body. Very nice representation of the style.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
1673,"2016-06-14",4.1,"Bottle. This has all the expected attributes, and well presented overall. Incredibly well bodied and fully flavored, rivaling many of the turbo-charged stouts out there, yet delivering a wallop of full-on roasted malt goodness. Delish.

1673,"2015-11-19",3.2,"12 oz. bottle. Pitch black pour, with a small, tan, bubbly head. The nose is toast, black coffee, and light syrup and anise. Roasty and lightly sweet, with a low bitterness. Dry and fairly balanced. Light to medium body, chalky, a little acidic, with a clean, watery finish. This is a well-made and tasty stout. Just a little burnt, but not too off-putting. The palate is a little weak, but not too bad. Just a simple, easy stout.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"
1673,"2015-11-18",3.3,"Pours a dark brown color. Or maybe its ruby red, hard to tell. Nice beige head. Some retention, hardly any lacing.Aroma is deep toasted malt. Toasted not roasted. Espresso, not really any chocolate. Maybe cherry.Taste is mostly espresso, this has no coffee in it, so thats the toasted malts. I say toasted because, well, just tastes that way. Very malty and bittersweet. I taste no hops. Not so creamy like you would expect from a stout. It has this weird metallic taste at the end.Mouthfeel is medium heavy. Again that metallic taste is off putting. The metallic feel turns into the toasted malt flavor, which is odd.Overall, Im not a fan. The bottle says its from the St. James location, maybe thats the difference. But seriously, Guinness is much better. Im disappointed.","Arkansas, USA","beer_rookie"
1673,"2015-11-02",4.0,"Bottle from gregwilsonstl, thanks for the opportunity! 
Dark brown with faint garnet at the edges, a smattering of off white bubbles grace the surface than quickly dissipate. Rich milk and dark chocolate notes dominate. Lightly fruity, lightly earthy. Fantastic stout, but much too sweet to be a dry stout. The carbonation is faint as well which may lead to a higher perception of sweetness.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
1673,"2015-10-28",3.7,"This is very dark brown w/ a ring of white head. It has a big chocolate and roasted coffee nose. It is very lightly tart w/ a touch of sweetness.

1673,"2015-10-19",3.6,"12 oz. bottle from Craft Beer Cellar - Clayton. Pours a dark cocoa brown with a small tan head that fades into a ring. Very straightforward stout - roasted and toasted malts, a bit of earth, and thats pretty much it. Light-bodied, with moderate to medium carbonation. I hadnt even read the deScription here before pouring and rating this. But yeah, it doesnt carry the coffee-chocolate thing from other stouts. Its lovely in its simplicity.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
1673,"2015-09-04",2.4,"Definitely a unique one. Very true to its dry stout nature with no coffee or chocolate flavors of note. Unfortunately this is to blame for its thin body and taste reminiscent of smoke and tobacco. Not bad, but similar to drinking charcoal if that was somehow remotely enjoyable.","Missouri, USA","AbbeyRoade"
1673,"2015-09-03",4.2,"Bottle, thanks mom! Rich roasted malt aroma with light chocolate as well. Pours black with a thin light brown head with good retention and lacing. Starts with rich roasted malt with a good medium body and smooth mouthfeel. Finishes smooth and dry with a bit chocolate before the roast comes back around and coats the palate. Excellent dry stout.","","zoucrew102"

1673,"2015-07-23",3.5,"Tap/growler - fair size tan foamy head, almost pitch black color, good mildly roasty malt aroma and flavor, maybe just a little chocolate note in there, good hop balance, pretty good for a stout (not my usual favorite type)

1673,"2015-06-18",3.3,"Shared 12 oz. bottle poured to snifters, showing a ruby highlighted, brown color, with a presentable layer of brownish tan head foam, and spots & streaks of lacing. The nose was roasted, malty, and sweet caramel. Light bodied, with low carbonation, the taste was similar to the aroma, but a little washed out, flavor wise. Appreciated the simplicity, though.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
1673,"2015-05-04",3.7,"The beer pours a clear dark reddish brown with a large tan head that persists somewhat. The aroma has lots of roasted and chocolate malts with a hint of smoke, and the taste is mildly umami, slightly bitter, and a touch sweet with roasted malts dominating the aftertaste. The palate fuses a thick texture, medium body, and a soft carbonation, but it is a tad too thin for the robust flavors.","Columbia, Missouri, USA","EtTuCthulhu"

1673,"2015-02-18",3.7,"Pours brown with a reddish tint and has a tan head. The aroma has chocolate, smooth roast, hazelnuts, light coffee and a hint of woody malt. Really nice and comes across as a stout with some brown ale slant. It has a medium light body with a light amount of carbonation. The flavor starts with dark roasty malt with more of a bite than the aroma, dark chocolate, nuttiness, spicy / earthy hops and a touch of coffee bitterness. There is more of the coffee taste and hops on the finish and is really clean and nice. Solid stout.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
