936,"2010-08-17",3.2,"Amber body with thin head that stretches to cover it. A bit fruity with more floral hop character than any common ale/steam beer that I can recollect. Nice easy leafiness and an enjoyable bitter leaf flavor. In fact, to me, this is more reminiscent of an ESB, and a solid, sessionable one at that. Twangy finish that is fairly bitter sour and a bit offkey--perhaps from rye malt.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
936,"2010-08-08",2.3,"Nowhere close to Anchor Steam in style.  A departure from the common.  sharp and vegetal.  a lot of floral notes.  not very hoppy or malty. thumbs down.","Glendale, California, USA","beersearcher"

936,"2010-04-02",3.5,"Tap @ Baileys Taproom...  Poured hazy, amber/orange with an off-white head.  Lightly hopped aroma lending towards a citrus nose.  A clean brew all around.  Noticeable malts and an earth, citrus hop flavor for a bitter balance to the sweet tones.  The Common Ale comes off nicely with an extra hop bite.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
936,"2010-01-13",3.6,"On tap at Mickey Finns. Hoppier than expected. Aroma a little laid back, maty with some hop edge. Light amber with minimal head (not a lot of head at this bar in general.) More hops than I expected, good carbonation, well-balanced, that lighter lager feel.","Portland, Oregon, USA","raphael"
