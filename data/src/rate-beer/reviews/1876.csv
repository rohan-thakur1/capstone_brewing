1876,"2017-04-12",3.9,"Date code L 016 Q 07:43, which apparently means bottled in mid January, 2017. Reviewed April 8, 2017. Bready aroma with spice. Deep golden color with tiny carbonation bubbles. An impressive looker. Topped (after a vigorous pour) with a tall, bubbly, off-white just nudging toward tan head, leaving thick lacing, but in no hurry to recede. Substantial to moderate feel with tingling on the tongue. Bready, toasty, and slightly spicy. Moderate bitterness asserts in the middle and finish, fading quickly. Leaves a pleasant sweetish malt or even caramel taste on the tongue and in the mouth. Malty, pushing toward but not to the point of being sweet.

Quite lager like initially, albeit a slightly stronger smelling with some solid malts and hints of sweetness. There is some background fruit & a pleasant freshness to the beer with some subtle grassy hops and very faint hints of alcohol too.

Clear, red tinged amber with a large, foamy white head & dome shaped head about 5cm tall with little movement and some lacing.

Malty taste combined with some sweetness & spice. Clean & fresh with some bitterness towards the end but in truth this is minimal. Grassy hops feature from about the middle on & are fairly subtle with the balanced malt taste dominating.

Clean, well balanced & full bodied beer with quite light carbonation & bitter aftertaste. The beer is smooth & goes down very easily.

Quite an enjoyable one from Hofbräuhaus despite the fact that there wasnt exactly a whole lot going on with this one other than the balance malts throughout. The beers most appealing aspects were the full bodied and smooth taste as well as how easy it was to sip away at.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

1876,"2013-10-09",3.7,"Presentation: It was poured from a green12oz bottle into my Hofbrau mug. It has a very short description on the back label but there is no mention of abv or a freshness date.

Appearance: Its body has a deep sunset orange hue with very good clarity. Sitting on top of this inviting brew is a tall but fleeting white head. It settles quickly and leaves only a thin filmy covering which needs a slight swirl to maintain.

Smell: The nose is fairly light and simple. I mostly get notes of herbal/mineral like hops with some sweet toffee and brown sugary like bready maltiness for balance.

Taste/Palate: There is a balance here between sweet malt and hop bitterness. Its maltiness matches the nose with notes of sweet bread, toffee and brown sugar. This blends with hop notes that add some crispness and dryness to the finish as well as earthy/leafy and a heavy herbal/mineral flavor notes along the way. The plate has a medium feel with balanced medium carbonation. This gives it excellent drinkability. 

Notes: The first few sips are heavy on the mineral notes and are bit distracting. Luckily this fades somewhat as it warms and more of the sweetness comes out. Overall I would call this a good average Maibock.","New York, USA","generallee08"

A - Pours a very clear amber with an off-white head

S - Dry bread, grass, sweet grain, nuts.

T - Honey covered grain, lemon zest, faint caramel, grassy hops add a light, but rough textured bitterness. Sweet alcohol comes through on the back of the tongue. Finishes wet and slick.

M - Heavier side of medium, alcohol is evident and appropriate, slick finish.

Overall all pretty good. This one was thin on flavor at times though. The hops seemed rough and didnt seem to pair with the rest of the components. I would drink this again but wouldnt seek it out.

The beer is transparent and light orange colored, with a small white head. Pockets of carbonation are visible throughout the beer. The aroma smells of a sweet lager with hints of fruit. The beer has a mild earthiness about it. The flavor brings a distinctive German lager character, with light fruit and a present sweetness. One is plenty for me, as the sweetness slowly becomes cloying. A decent brew and a solid example of the style, I would have it again.

1876,"2011-08-10",3.5,"My Bottom Line :  
Nicely developed light caramel malts nearly cover this Bocks earthy hops and their balancing bitterness. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam covers the clear pale amber. 
-The malt flavors are honeyed but also lightly caramelized.
-A soft fullness is built by the peaceful effervescence and plump residual sugars. 
-This is a malt-focused brew all the way; linear, yes, but good.

1876,"2011-04-10",3.9,"Presentation: It was poured from a green12oz bottle into my Hofbrau mug. It has a very short description on the back label but there is no mention of abv or a freshness date.

Appearance: Its body has a deep sunset orange hue with very good clarity. Sitting on top of this inviting brew is a tall but fleeting white head. It settles quickly and leaves only a thin filmy covering which needs a slight swirl to maintain.

Smell: The nose is fairly light and simple. I mostly get notes of herbal/mineral like hops with some sweet toffee and brown sugary like bready maltiness for balance.

Taste/Palate: There is a balance here between sweet malt and hop bitterness. Its maltiness matches the nose with notes of sweet bread, toffee and brown sugar. This blends with hop notes that add some crispness and dryness to the finish as well as earthy/leafy and a heavy herbal/mineral flavor notes along the way. The plate has a medium feel with balanced medium carbonation. This gives it excellent drinkability.

Notes: The first few sips are heavy on the mineral notes and are bit distracting. Luckily this fades somewhat as it warms and more of the sweetness comes out. Overall I would call this a good average Maibock.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

1876,"2010-10-13",4.0,"The Hofbrau brewery knows how to please locals, visitors, and international tasters alike. Their original interpretation of a maibock fails to disappoint. Aroma: mostly sweet malt with just enough hop and pleasant alcohol to balance. Appearance: dark gold with a decent head that leaves some lacing and a nice ring as you drink (the alcohol level helps with the head retention). Taste: the sweet malt comes through crisp and clean without any caramel and toffee flavor. It is well balanced with just a slight bitterness and light alcohol warmth that prevent it from being overly sweet. Overall: one of my favorite styles; carries that grassy, malty sweet taste and aroma that begs for another sip (like a maltier helles or a slightly stronger marzen). Definitely want a few bottles enen though theyre pushing 7% ABV.","Pennsylvania, USA","Breinstein"

1876,"2010-05-27",4.0,"33cl bottle.   Just getting into the hofbrau line, after having their o-fest back in the tent in munich a couple years back.   They do a very respectable pale wiesen-style beer for the festival, which is almost as good in bottles here if you can find it kept out of the light (green bottle syndrome).   I see the weisen-style oktoberfests as pretty much a baby maibock, so its no surprise that this is also a very solid effort.   Clear amber in color, is sports a big fluffy white head that settles to a ring of foam after a few minutes.   The aroma has a rich bready malt profile with a touch of caramel and dark bread crust.   Plenty of melanoidins, which is what drives the style for me.   There is also a lingering background spicy hop touch.   The flavor has much of the same rich melanoidin character as the aroma, and balances it with a healthy hop bitterness and spicy hop flavor that supports.   Medium bodied with tight carbonation.   Slight caramel sweetness in the finish.   Just a touch of oxidation shows, no doubt from age and travel, but this beer is robust enough to weather it quite well.   A tasty maibock, and one that could get you in trouble if you were in Munich drinking it by the maß.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

1876,"2009-05-22",3.5,"Enjoyed on tap at Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh.  Given the fact that I was at the Hofbrauhaus and this was one of their specialty beers imported from Germany, my hopes and expectations were rather high.  The 16oz sample poured a nice dark brown to very dark copper.  The nose was really inviting, giving appetising notes of Munich malt and perhaps a little bit of Pilsner malt peaking through.  Unfortunately, I found the palate to be rather one-sided.  Obviously, the style is malt-forward, and I have no complaint with that.  However, I was expecting a little more complexity than what I ultimately got.  Also, the rather abrubt ending of the beer was unpleasantly surprising.  There was no long lingering finish that one gets somewhat used to when drinking higher strength German Mai- and Doppelbocks.

1876,"2006-12-12",3.6,"Picked up a bottle of this from an off-license off Landsberger strasse, München, Germany.  Felt inspired after a first time at the Hofbräu, took this one back to our hostel and downed it just before I rid myself of the pent up aromatics of the day at hand, ahem, took a shower.Produced itself a bright, shimmering copper in the glass, tawny in the depths. The head rose and fell quickly as my glass was in desperate need of a clean. I guess it would have presented well as the carbonation seemed minute and slow to release. Aroma seemed fruity, dominantly fruity - which is not the prerequisite of the style - though a dark honey, tree-bark and dusted, toasted malt addition made this sumptuous. It repeats in the mouth, quite sweet, heavily toasted and honeyish with evident herbal hops in back. Body is medium, its not robust though it has good presence and is highly viscous on the tongue and in the swallow. A supple fruit edge like the aroma, vinous, tangy, faintly citric adjoining the hops as it presses the palate. Finish has a ripe fruit tang - mandarin - and a soft, vine clipping bitterness before it drops off with a good, well-pronounced warmth from that alcohol. It doesnt show until the end but it is definitely not shy, though not at all disturbing. Polished off, satisfied at my notes, I went down to the hostels bar to join others from around the world to enjoy litres of shitty cheap lager and maybe a few laughs. Best of the day.

Lacing was just above average, much better than the head would have led one to believe. The aroma was light caramel and some saaz hops. Flavor was caramel and light dark fruits, the latter unexpected based on the color and style. Nonetheless, they were light and the hops took over in the finish: light grassy saaz tones with a touch of spice to finish. Not a bad maibock at all. Alcohol a little sharp and the breadiness was underplayed (ie. not detected at all). Mouthfeel slightly sharp from the alcohol, but not cloying sweet like others have commented.

Vibrant copper (Fritha reckons amber), bright, lightly carbonated, with a disappearing off-white head.  Mild nose, but very pleasant, shows off caramel malts, spicy continental hops and a hint of lager yeast.  Sweet and sappy malts blend well with with grassy spicy hops and end in a slightly astringent finish (probably the only downfall as it just leans away from perfectly balanced).  Ive seen these Hofbrau beers on the shelf for a couple of months now and the Maibock is a very pleasant surprise (thanks Fritha).

The first sip was when things started to unravel - alcohol not well hidden at all.  Rich malt, barley-grain taste complimented by the expected wheat notes.  Nearing the end of the beer, the alcohol seemed drawn apart and even more intrusive.  Last 25% of the beer was sticky and separated; astringent.  The sweetness became overbearing.

It was so difficult to find a seat, but a nice trio of Americans slid over in the booth and allowed us to share the late afternoon meal with them.

My daughter, two years old at the time, loved the large dough pretzels and the oomp-pah band.  Well, here is my first visit back to the Hofbrau, with a much different beer.  Caramel color and aroma, with a nice head, and a tongue-coating but somewhat flat palate, this beer is rich enough and flavorful enough (caramel and dried fruit, without any negative flavors) to rank as a very enjoyable beer, though again I had a slightly-less-than-expectations experience due to the mouthfeel that comes out a bit sweetly dead, though it does have an oily richness to it.

Finishes with more malt and caramel, faint grassy notes, and light Euro hops. Original rating was a 3.2.","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
1876,"2002-07-25",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2003 How do they get the goat on the label to hold a stein when everybody knows goats don't have opposable thumbs?!  A light, sourish/sweetish, copper-colored maibock beer that won't be confused with a doppelbock anytime soon.  Could drink more than one.  Very very malty and caremelly sweet with a hint of alcohol.  Nice toffee aroma, too.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
1876,"2002-07-24",3.9,"Lovely amber almond in color and sports a sweet rich aroma that is a bit yeasty. The body is light, but deep with malt flavors that linger on the palette. A fine beer I must say.","Kenosha, Wisconsin, USA","GPyott"
1876,"2002-07-17",3.9,"Good head starts off the pour.  A nice aroma of chestnuts and malt.  An intersting, subtle flavor and texture.  A bit sour on the top of the palate, with acidic textures on the side of the tongue.  Full flavor malt gives this beer a great body.  This is a quality beer that should be tried.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
1876,"2002-07-08",3.4,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2004 Best before 02-3-03 Copper color liquid sitting atop a dense foam.  Abundant toasty, nutty, caramel malt.  A mixture of hay/dung smell, unlike the familiar Belgian barnyard traits, takes the aroma above and beyond traditional Maibock boundaries.  Hops are present, yet very subdued.  Acidic twang rides the palate before caramel and nuts gain full control.  Bountiful carbonation leads me to believe this beer is alive and well.  Malt accented, but fairly simplistic.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1876,"2002-05-22",2.4,"Orange-amber colored, with light carbonation and a lingering head.  Aroma is mostly dark grain, nutty, maybe a little wet cardboard (now I understand people mean when theyve mentioned that)  Fairly drinkable, but far from exciting.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
1876,"2002-05-13",3.7,"Light amber color, with a head leading to nice lace.  Slight toast and toffee flavors.  A generally nondisagreeablr brew.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1876,"2002-04-05",2.8,"Malty, yes, but kind of light. Lacks the depth of malt flavors I want out of a lager; might as well be drinking an Amstel.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
1876,"2002-04-05",3.5,"Nice malty bock, with lots of sweet flavors but smooth enough to drink quite a lot of it.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
1876,"2002-01-26",3.9,"Love the maltyness of this brew. A tad sweet but it is afterall a Mai Bock. Great to wash down a juicy steak!","Alabama, USA","joelumbumbard99"
1876,"2002-01-08",3.6,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2003 Very very nice. As malty as is possible, I do believe. Not too sweet, but mighty close.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
1876,"2001-06-26",4.4,"mmm, wonderfully toasty and toffeeish.  
Love that malt flavor.  Delectable 
and a perfect match for savory foods.  
Nice depth to the flavor.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
