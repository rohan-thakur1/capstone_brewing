3711,"2017-06-06",3.4,"Draft at the brewpub. An Irish ale? It seems like a hoppy American ale to me. At what point does one call it an IPA? Plenty of resiny grapefruit bite in the taste and a bitter aftertaste. The best aspect is the nice malty-floral sweetness in the nose. All right.","USA","Slipstream"
3711,"2016-05-06",3.3,"Draft at brewpub. Pours Amber with a white head. Leaves a shitload of lacing in the glass. Solid floral hop notes on the nose. Fairly floral on the tongue. Finished clean. It's solid but like most attempts to turbocharge the style the answer is usually bigger hops.

Comes to the table a cloudy amber color with a creamy off white head. Malty caramel aroma with a solid shot of resinous hops. The flavor is malty and rich with a huge resinous earthy hop flavor that I really wasnt expecting. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. A bit hoppy for the style, but hell Im not complaining it works.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
3711,"2012-08-30",3.6,"On tap at Northampton Brewery on 19 April 2010. A hoppy red ale. Much stronger hops than the average red and all the better for that. Good balance of toasty malt and bitter hops. An excellent drop.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
3711,"2011-08-20",3.6,"Best beer of the night. Big hop flavors that are very well matched to big malt amber flavors. Nice bitter malty finish. Both sides of the beer are well balanced throughout the beer flavor. NICE. :)","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3711,"2011-08-20",3.5,"On tap at NoHo. A nice looking amber. Good aromas. Flavors are surprisingly on the hoppy side, but still balanced enough to enjoy the malts. Clean, spicy-hop finish. Very decent.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","MaBeer1972"

3711,"2007-03-10",3.2,"Draught @ Brewpub: This one pours a clear amber color.  There was little head and minimal lacing.  The aroma is a bit weak.  It is lightly sweet, with a bit of caramel malt.  The taste is slightly dry, and somewhat malty.  Decent enough.","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"

3711,"2007-02-21",3.4,"Pours red with a tan head.  Smells of earthy hops and spicy with some peppery elements.  Tastes mildly hoppy with some light malty elements.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
3711,"2006-07-11",3.8,"22 oz bomber.  Deep amber beer, thin off-white head.  Aroma is very earthy, sweet toasty/caramelly malts, salty/herbal leafy hop aroma.  Earthy, slightly woody.  Cedary resiny aroma with a basil and oregano overtones.  Strong sweet cherry/apple aroma.  Flavour is earthy with cherry/berry notes throughout.  Lightly musty character, leafy tobaccoish flavour on the back of the palate.  Well-hopped, good bitterness and loads of leafy hop flavour mixed with the sweet malts.  Reminds me of Boomers red... a very solid ESB.  Tasty brew... probably the best I tried from these guys.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3711,"2006-01-28",4.0,"This beer is an Irish Red Ale by style, but with healty dose of American hop character. Irish Red Ales tend to be malty and fruity, with a nice ""buttery"" character as well. Red Headed Step Child has all that, but with a blast of American hops, that make this beer all the more tasty and drinkable. This was a wonderful beer to sip and relax with at the bar, and would make a great beer to match with a number of the delicious dishes found on the Northampton menu. 

Red Headed Step Child pours to a beautiful, bright, ruby red color with a thick and creamy white head, and a good bit of carbonation. The nose on this beer is excellent with lots of good sweet and stewed malt aroma paired with some fruity estery aroma, and fragrant citrus hop aroma. The palate has a buttery, slightly rich mouth feel, with lots of good sweet malt flavor, paired with estery fruit flavor. Red Headed Step Child finishes with more good sweet malty and tangy fruit flavors up front, then ends with a zesty punch of citrus hop bite that lingers on the tongue. 

An excellent Irish Red Ale with a hoppy American bite, this is beer is one you will want to enjoy a few pints of. The quality of the beers being brewed at Northampton are second to none, and this place is well worth a visit if you ever find yourself in Northampton.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
