2324,"2017-06-16",4.0,"So maybe I should not be sampling Christmas Ale the first really hot weekend of the summer. But it is St. Bernardus, why not? Put away after a spring trip to eastern New Mexico, saved until now. The 750 ml bottle gives an amber-brown body and a healthy beige head. An inviting nose, I detect yeasty bread and tropical fruit, maybe a little floral. I taste to get currants, figs, some hard candy sweetness. It finishes dry in the mouth, very little bitterness. Glad I got a try at this. Other Belgians deliver more.","Midland, Texas, USA","KevinReddirt"

Interesting & drinkable but disappointing when compared to the previous St. Bernardus offerings & definitely lacking something. Opening a lot weaker than expected with a light, sweet taste, it didnt seem like a 10% beer. There was good carbonation & the darker fruits were nice but they seemed fleeting & not strong enough. It was a relatively easy beer to drink though with a subtle tang & okay balance but it was a little underwhelming & easily my least favourite St. Bernardus beer thus far.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

2324,"2017-01-19",4.0,"12 oz. bottle. Dark fruit and cherry aromas along with a slight sour note and a touch of cream. The color appears to be a dark brown until its put under a bright light where it appears almost a deep rose color which is beautiful. The taste follows from the aroma with cherry, plum, cranberry and apricot along with a very slightly sour woodiness and a bit of Belgian yeastiness. The body is relatively thin for a Christmas beer with this level of fruit and alcohol, but its not watery. And speaking of alcohol, this does *not* seem like a 10% ABV beer (which is dangerous)!

2324,"2017-01-12",3.8,"Pours a deep brown with a tan, lingering head. There's a good bit of yeast in this bottle. I swirled and poured it all, so there's a good fruity yeast aroma. This is predominant on the nose. Yeast comes through in the flavor as well. There's a good bitterness that sticks around and a somewhat silky, fizzy mouthfeel. There's slight warming in the lower esophagus but not much. There's a tad of vinous, boozy tang on the tongue, though. A good Christmas Belgian ale. Could have more flavor.

2324,"2017-01-08",5.0,"Une claque! Cest une véritable claque prise en découvrant cette St Bernardus Christmas Ale. Et pourtant jy étais préparé, je savais que jallais aborder une bière dexception. Mais lémotion est toujours indescriptible en découvrant ce type de bière que jappellerais bière ""cathédrale"". ""Cathédrale"" car à linstar de ces références architecturales à la fois impressionnantes par leurs dimensions, leur assise au sol mais également par leur profil élancé et leur finesse, la St Bernardus Christmas impressionne par son ampleur et son intensité gustative mais également par la finesse de ses arômes et son élégance. ""Cathédrale"", car à linstar de ces chefs duvres bâtis par lhomme où chaque pierre révèle en elle même de milliers de détails raffinés et élégants, sassemblant dans une parfaite harmonie, la Saint Bernardus Christmas a une complexité gustative exceptionnelle évoluant tout au long de la dégustation dans un parfait équilibre. Déjà, en verre, notre bière est prête à nous amener vers lélévation. Un brun profond, opaque, couplé à une effervescence marquée lui conférant une splendide mousse beige, crémeuse de deux centimètres dépaisseur. Le nez est alors alors un premier pas vers les 7ème ciel avec des arômes à la fois épicés et fruités : cannelle, badiane, cerise, pruneau, poire et abricot sentremêlent pour notre plus grand plaisir. La dégustation vous confère alors des émotions que seuls les grands chefs uvres sont capable de procurer. Le syndrome de Stendhal nest pas loin. Lattaque est pleine et soyeuse sur la cerise, le raisin et la cannelle avec une dimension vineuse certaine. Cest alors lexplosion en bouche, pruneau, chocolat, cerise et date sintègrent à une amertume, très pointue, cisaillant les arômes et très bien soutenue par les 10% Abv. La corpulence est exceptionnelle et lharmonie sans faute. Le final, finira votre élévation par une déclinaison dépices : cannelle, badiane et thym notamment donneront une nouvelle dimension et une multitude de déclinaisons....Un noël tout simplement magique, qui ne demande quà être partagé avec ses proches.","FRANCE","jybi"

Sublime sur tous les plans ! En bouche, grosse surprise : bière beaucoup moins sucrée quil ny parait, amertume franche et légère sécheresse, alcool généreux, carbonatation solide. La deuxième gorgée révèle la levure, les céréales et les notes boisées. La troisième est directement sur les liqueurs type mirabelle et prune ainsi que sur les vins pétillants (Champagne, Clairette, Lambrusco etc.)... Les suivantes vont évoluer sur les houblons, très végétaux et assez secs avec une grosse longueur, les notes de terre et de tanin qui rappellent quelques vins du côté de Bordeaux. Le final est excellent, lalcool descend délicatement mais sûrement le long de lsophage, larrière-bouche sarrêtant sur ce côté liqueur, les épices et les herbes ainsi que sur quelques céréales. Bière très complexe qui demande à être apprivoisée en plus dêtre assez surprenante. On retrouve en bouche et avec plaisir quelques notes de balsamique et de Lambic qui rappelle la Bourgogne des Flandres, cest un régal ! Cette bière de Noël nest peut être pas ma favorite dans le genre, mais je dois reconnaître un travail de brassage assez exceptionnel voir génial qui menchante le corps et lesprit.

Good amount of carbonation. Very little aftertaste.

The appearance was a hazy brown color with a one finger sustaining white foamy head that concaves a bit but holds its own for a good two minutes before dissipating ever so lightly. 
The smell had a sweet to lightly spiced combination of cinnamon and ginger running into a sweet biscuity/bready goodness. Subtle hints of cocoa allocate nicely in and around my nose.
The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors to combine and flavor a sweet bready aftertaste leading into a semi - wet finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sipping quality running about. Carbonation seems to run smooth and semi-dry.

2324,"2014-11-20",3.5,"750 ml bottle, poured into a snifter at room temperature.

A: Pours a rich, deep bronze-brown, and forms a fantastically thick head with good retention. Fairly clear, enough to see the bubbles rising from the bottom. Lacing is rather remarkable - this amount of froth and lacing should not even be possible for a 10% ABV beer!

S: Sweet malt and yeast, wreathed through with plum, fig, and cherry notes. The candi sweetness is of course present, along with just a tinge of funk.

T: So, thats what a quad with cinnamon in it tastes like. Theres significant heat in this, from a combination of cinnamon spice with noticeable alcohol. Sweet malt, candi sugar, and dark fruits, particularly cherry, are all present, but beneath the spiceahol mix. The finish leaves a lingering burn.

M: Rather thin and sharply carbonated for a quad, actually. I was expecting something stickier, given the head and lacing.

O: I am rather underwhelmed by this beer, especially from St. Bernardus. The Abt 12 is spectacular, but this does not disguise the alcohol content half as well - instead, it disguises the underlying yeast flavors with alcohol and spice. I wouldnt say it is a bad beer, but I would not go out of my way to have it again. Perhaps if I were to encounter it on tap somewhere for a decent price per pour.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Very big creamy foamy head. Hazy deep dark red ish brown to almost black colored beer.
Aroma and flavour are very fruity, but specially for the flavour the time of airing makes this a more subtle beer in which the (fruity) sweetness becomes less and more balance with bitters and other ingredients like malts, herbs, yeast and some dried leaves with caramel tones.
The aftertaste is fruity, in the background. The malts and hay and caramel are more present than in the flavour itself.
Overall I would say store this away for a year or two and open one than, must become better with some years. This does not mean its bad but it tastes a bit young I guess...
Carbonation level is quite low and causes the mouhfeel to be creamy. The body is more than medium because of all the flavours mixed (or not mixed) are pretty strong present.

2324,"2014-08-17",4.2,"Transfer from BA review on 12-4-12-
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer was served a deep mahogany colored brew with a decent haze and a thick one finger head. The head faded holds on for some time, eventually fading to give a decent level of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma was heaviest of dark fruit aromas of plum, raisin and some fig. Mixed with these aromas is a very subtle spice (cinnamon and nutmeg) aroma as well as a yeast aroma and a little bit of banana.

 Taste  The taste begins with the dark sweet fruits that were detected in the nose. The raisin and prune character of the taste are soon joined by a yeasty taste as well as a spice flavor. While the spice starts off on the weaker side it soon grows stronger with flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg becoming more potent. Flavors of a banana nature and some bready tastes then come to the tongue. These flavors all mingle together to in the end , with the advent of some alcohol taste, leave a warming fruity spiced taste to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel The body of the beer is quite creamy with a carbonation level that is rather moderate. The creamy body is fantastic as it baths the tongue in the fruit, bready, and warming alcohol flavors of the brew. The carbonation seems to add just the right excitement to the mouthfeel to complement the spice tastes. Overall rather pleasant.

 Overall  Quite tasty of fruit, warming and just the right amount of spice. A delicious winter warmer.","","Darkmagus82"

merveilles  Attention chef doeuvre !!!
Bouteille de 75 cl à 10 % abv... beau programme !!!
Couleur entre noir et roux très foncé.
Clarté très opaque. Bulles assez grosses mais vraiment très nombreuses, partout dans le verre,
et très vives. Mousse beige, café crème, soyeuse au centre et à flocons au bord.
Arômes vineux, fruits confits, fruits mûrs, avec une pointe dépices orientales.
1ère bouche soyeuse sur du très grand bourgogne rouge, style clos Vougeot, je ne vous dirai pas quelle parcelle, mais un indice : de là on peut voir la Romanée Conti 
Cette bouche présente un liant superbe et des épices. Larrière-bouche est sublime, elle offre
tout en même temps : pain complet, vin, lie, fruits nobles, malt, etc.

du thym et du romarin.
3ème nez avec une pointe danis délicate.

la levure, le houblon, etc etc. Cette bière est dans le sens propre du terme « capiteuse », et elle
est digne des plus grands vins français. Nous en avons cité deux en début de critique, mais il

Moderate sweetness that perfectly compliments the other flavors. The finish is moderately dry leaving just the smallest hint of residual sweetness. Alcohol is completely hidden save for a slight bit of warming making this a pleasure to drink.

Overall, this is really one of the best beers I have ever had. Just so much going on and all the flavors and characteristics are perfectly balanced. Dangerously drinkable and one to really savor during the holidays.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

Nuances of marzipan, toffee, wood and heavily roasted grains give it depth. Long, dry, stone-fruit and dark malt swallow edged by more bitter herbs, yeast and a very subtle touch of metallic tannins.

2324,"2012-05-10",3.8,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a St. Bernardus branded goblet.

The bottle creates a loud pop when I pull the cork, but it is no gusher.  A burgundy brown colored beer is full and rich to the eye, with a full eggshell white head that is initially huge before settling down a little bit.

The aroma is full of plums, dates, and a bit of raisins.  Holiday spices light up the nose as well.  All of these aromas exist in front of a full caramel malt.

My first sip is quite sweet.  Brown sugar, plums, dates, figs, and raisins are the most noticeable at first.  The holiday spices from the nose come through as well; nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon all work well with the fruit notes.  A bit of bread crusts and sweet caramel provide the malt presence.  There is a bit of booze and light dry bitterness toward the end of the sip.

From the pop of the cork, it was obvious that this is a well-carbonated brew.  It is a overly creamy carbonation with a little bit of a bubbly nature as well, as I am used to in the abbey ales.  The flavor starts sweet and sticky and finishes with a light residue on the lips.  

Overall I thought this was quite complex and enjoyable.  Pretty much what I would expect out of St. Bernardus.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

2324,"2012-04-09",4.8,"On 15th Dec 2011 I wrote this: At last Ive had an on-tap St Bernardus Christmas Ale that I could review (the other times Ive drank it I didnt really have reviewing opportunities, beerfests etc). This time however was different: the lovely Red Rose bar in Brugge being the venue. 33cl for Euro 4.00, worth every cent.

Poured into a St Bernardus goblet it looked the business in every way: Jet black with a deep beige crown of tight bubbles sat on top. The head stayed and gave waves of lacing as I wolfed the brew down.

The smell was of dark, rich, candied fruits with a good measure of caramel and malts thrown in.

The taste always blows me away, creamy, rich and hearty in every way, yet its so mellow the 10%ABV does not show at all; this is a dangerous brew and so, so easy on the palate it just slides down the throat at an alarming rate. A brew to savour, but very difficult not to quaff at pace and order another, and another, and another. Whatever spices they use just enhance the flavours from the mash tun and helps to turn the brew from excellent to superb. 

A true classic and a beer Ill never tire of drinking (if Ive got the next day off).","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

2324,"2011-12-17",3.8,"I split a 750ml corked and caged bottle with a friend. We poured it into tulip glasses.

Appearance: Very dark brown/maroon/mahogany hue. Opaque but plenty of visible carbonation sticks to the side of the glass. Forms a large, white, foamy head which laces and retains quite well.

Smell: Strong banana and clove aroma. More so than anything else, actually. Some general spice to the nose as well as hints of alcohol.

Taste: Belgian quads and ""strong dark ales,"" especially Trappist and abbey brews, tend to have a natural spicy/peppery taste and sensation to them. I think the idea behind St. Bernardus Christmas Ale was to capitalize on that foundation and make it even stronger. The result is a beer that is both effervescent and spicy as can be without actually adding any additional spices to it.

As soon as the beer hits the tongue, the entire mouth is engulfed in classic Belgian spice. Perhaps ""spice"" isnt the appropriate description since I cant pick out any flavors akin to ginger, cinnamon, etc. Rather, its closer to table black pepper, but in liquid form. The beer seems to swell up and occupy the mouth with a foamy texture and intense peppery sensation. Once you get used to it you begin to taste the classic Belgian flavors of dark fruit, and confectionary (especially caramel) sweetness Alcohol imparts a subtle warmth on the aftertaste, but otherwise its remarkably clean although slightly dry. Tasty and satisfy to be sure, but nothing in the ballpark of genuinely amazing. Perhaps a vintage would be, though.

Mouthfeel: Extremely intense with massive effervescence and a sensation of living foam. 

Drinkability: While St. Bernardus Christmas Ale may be a commendable brew for its palate and relative complexity, it must be penalized for its very low drinkability. Its beers like this I point to as an example of just how zesty and spastic a Belgian yeast strain can be. The carbonation gets stuck in the throat after ever swig, regardless of whether its a big gulp or a gentle sip. The 10% ABV is well utilized as theres only a minor warming sensation and taste, but after one serving you definitely feel it all. You also feel quite full.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Mouth feel is almost gooey, and leaves a lot of stickiness in the mouth. There are notes of fruitiness, a bit of sugar, a mild, but strange, bitterness.

Feels nice to crack open a great beer for a special occasion, doesnt it? Well, Ive been a huge fan of St. Bernardus Abt 12 for a while, and after being told by many people this was even better, I was antsy to try it!! Popped the cork and poured into a Trappist glass. Pours a deep, dark brown with a thick, frothy off-white head with speckles of what appears to be spices. So far so good! Aroma is very intriguing. Huge hits of nutmeg, cinnamon, dark fruit, caramel, bread dough, vanilla, and even a bit of clove in there. The taste is very similar; notes of pumpkin pie (probably from the nutmeg), bread dough, chocolate, banana, and caramel. Very complex beer. Has a strong malty backbone overlaid nicely with the spices. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very smooth and velvety with light carbonation. Finishes like a bite of fresh pumpkin pie. Ive got to say, Im pretty impressed with this beer. Im a huge fan of winter warmers, and this is a perfect example of one. Better than Abt 12? Maybe... theyre both phenomenal in their own right.

A - Hazy chestnut brown with a good amount of sediment. Smaller, bubbly, foamy, light, off-white head. Disappears pretty fast leaving a wispy ring of lace.

S - Classic BSDA aroma with a bit more spice that others. Dark fruit, dark bread, and some spiciness (both Christmasy and BSDA spice).

T - Like the aroma this has what you would expect from a BSDA. Plenty of raisin and some dark bread. A good amount of spice including some earthy spice, cinnamon, clove, pepper, and a touch of orange peel. Some Belgian yeast flavors come out. More bitter than I was expecting.

M - Medium body with average carbonation. Has a bit of a zesty feel and less creaminess than I was expecting.

D - It made for a nice holiday sipper. Lots of spice and typical BSDA flavors. A little strong with the spice and bitterness cuts down on how easy it is to drink.

2324,"2010-11-06",3.7,"Murky brown with a thin khaki collar, he eventually settles under a paper-thin film which lingers throughout most of our tasting session. Bready and rich comes to mind upon putting my nose deep into his, so deep that when I come back up for air a droplet of Christmas dangles from the tip of mine. Pureed prunes, dates, and raisins settle into a rich sauce of caramelized sugars, brown especially, while his dark fruit presence weighs heavy upon my heart. I have a suspicion that my St. Bernardus Christmas is going to make up for the others lighter disposition in spades. Full-bodied and uber-creamy, I revel in the first of many slow and steady sups. Spice teases the back of my throat while warmth immediately starts her slow crawl through my chest. Heavy and dark sweet breads abound while all those wonderful dark fruits now find themselves getting happily drunk in a vat of aged rum. A hint of candied fruit and candied sugar sweetness pokes her head from under the dark delights, but she doesnt last long which is fine and dandy with me. Quaff and repeat, I slowly savor his powerfully balanced palate of decadent Christmas delights. I wasnt lounging with a snifter in front of a fireplace, but that sounds just about right.

The flavor is heavily malty; toasty and lightly sweet like a little bit of apple butter on toast.  The middle is dominated by prunes, figs, and a warming alcohol sensation; nice.  There are hints of coffee as the beer warms.  The finish is a bit metallic with an alcohol bite.  Huge, smooth body.  This is a Belgian Dark and possibly better than the much esteemed Abt 12.

It finishes lightly to moderately sweet and moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture and lively carbonation.

2324,"2009-11-30",3.9,"75cl bottle split with larryLSB.   A very nice and very typical Belgian christmas specialty ale that reminds me of Gouden Carolous or Nice Chouffe to an extent.   Spiced and perfumey, but with a smooth fruitiness.   Murky brown in color with a creamy light beige head.   Purple highlights.   Floral, perfumey aroma with a touch of anise, some figs, light dough, fruity yeast, orange peel, and sweet honeyish, syrupy malt in the aroma.   The flavor is almost like a spiced cookie with just a few raisins in it.   Light clove ginger and alcohol.   Sweet, but alcohol just wins out in the end without being harsh.   Low bitterness makes the sweetness stand out more, but the finishing gravity is still pretty low, and shows in the light and clean body, aided by high carbonation.   The carbonation is appropriate for the style, but is just a tad too coarse and only becomes pleasant with a good deal of swirling to knock it down a couple notches.   Great beer besides this.   Definitely a solid christmas ale, and the Belgians make what is probably my favorite style of the season.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

GREAT malt taste, its not that strong but still manages to be rich, the usual x-mas spices are there I think but you really have to want to taste them, the ale flavour eclipses them, though as I have a few more sips there are starting to show. I think I had this beer too cold for full flavour but unfortunately I cant decipher the heiroglyphs they call farenheight to accurately discern that.

Also notes of must. Has just a touch of brett in it - from what I can tell, which gives this beer a very dry flavor on the palate.

2324,"2009-10-28",3.4,"On tap, Wurstkuche.  Pours brown-ruby, slightly opaque, and with a small beige head.

Flavor starts with a bite of sweet malt and brown sugar.  The noel spices really come into their own in the finish, a bit heavy-handed if you ask me.  The finish is peppery, boozy, with strong cinnamon.  Just doesnt come through with the smoothness I wanted from a winter warmer.  Fittingly, this beer tastes like a Belgian version of Anchors Our Christmas, but less well put together.  Doesnt even compare when put next to Abt 12.

2324,"2009-10-21",4.0,"K, almost a year old...
My bottle pretty much exploded. Dumped out a massive bubbly light brown cap that stays forever and leaves a total disaster in  my glass... the foam has tons of speckly sediment trapped in it. Its hard to tell on the colour with so much sediment - seems reddish when up to a light with the crown gone. Attentive yet uninspiring nose: sweet caramel, dates.. or figs? weak molasses, raisin, dark fruit, spices that may be hiding the alcohol... I really dont think I can breathe deep enough to pick up the alc. Banana? Hell yea... seems to be becoming more prevalent. Its taken a while for these aromas to free themselves. As this warms a plumy spice with a very distant banana becomes the standard. Gonna be feeling this by the time I finish it! The taste is infectious - I cannot stop drinking this! I predict that Ill finish the entire 750ml in under 20 mins. What a tasty beer - nothing that blows me away but just so damn drinkable. Spices, sweet caramel, plumbs and raisins on the first sip. Sweet and spiced and done to perfection. This is no complex beer but the flavours are perfect. Very well balanced... ahhaha now that Im drunk and way to jacked on Slipknot its hard giving 10s and 5s. Light dates, nut and chocolate, tons of malts.

2324,"2009-10-02",4.5,"An excellent sweet Belgian Dark.

Was happy to find this on tap at the local Beer Bar.

Pours a dark reddish brown with little if any head.

Smell is of sweet friuts, figs, raisins, and some spice. The sweet smells over shadow light notes of malt, chocolate, and there is little if any alcohol in the smell.

Taste starts sweet with fruit and spices in good balance, slightly overshawdowing the malt. The sweet flavor last right through the end, but never is overwhelming to the flavor of the beer. The finsih is mildly bitter (very mild), slightly alcohol warm, and unexpectedly crisp. Taste is almost a 5 just a little sweet for me. Overall one most unique beers that I have truely enjoyed with the combination of subtle flavors and balance making this a winner!

Banana, nut, cherry, dates, and cloves all play nearly equal roles. On the heavier side of medium-bodied with ample carbonation.

2324,"2009-02-18",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2009 In short: A Belgian Christmas dark ale that is extra-yeasty, a little fruity, a little spicy and relatively dry.   Very good beer
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed when 1 year of age.
The look: Dark ruby (almost mahogany) body topped by a large beige head
In long: From the nose I could tell this is a very yeasty beer.  Nose also has a lot of woody hops.  Taste is unsurprisingly very yeasty but not as fruity as with most extra-yeasty beer.  Tree bark, dry wood, dried dates, dried figs, nuts, caramel, some toffee.  For once the usual Christmas spices (cloves mainly) are very well integrated and do not feel like an addition.  No alcohol presence at all, this beer is surprisingly drinkable for a 10% monster.  Expansive foamy/spongy body.  Very good but not excellent.  From most other breweries this beer would be an achievement, but coming from St-Bernardus it is only a moderate success because they have set the bar so high.  If all bars were set so high only basketball players would be able to order a beer in a pub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Despite small blemishes, this is a very well made beer.  The flavor is deep and rich, and the palate builds up as you go through the body.  Like a typical Christmas ale, this beer has a strong candy taste on the nose with a relatively benign finish.

The nose doesnt surprise too much, though there arent lots of spice presence that I may have expected from a Christmas ale.  The main aromas are the Belgian yeast and candi sugar that form the base with hints of dark fruits and bread as well.

The taste is also mainly that of a dark Belgian with tons of sweet malts, Belgian yeast and candi sugar.  However, I definitely get more spices than the aroma would suggest as well as raisins and plums.  There is a slight bitterness in the aftertaste along with some alcohol burn that warms me up a bit.

**Flavor / Palate** - Carbonated and chocolately the experience was different than I expected.  Warm and mellow it comes across as a little stronger than it should be in my opinion.

Medium-full bodied, with moderate carbonation, I feel that most of the substance comes from the residual sugar.  This is a tasty brew, but I would prefer some semblance of hop balance, as this one proved just a bit too sweet for me.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
2324,"2008-12-07",3.7,"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Pours a muddy dark brown with a thick tan head that sticks around until the liquid is gone. Great thick lacing.

Rummy raisins, orange peel, ginger, and licorice. Alcohol and carbonation are a bit too apparent and so this beer is not particularly drinkable, but it is a nice warming winter treat to share.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

Flavor features a good nasal passage-clearing dose of ABV in the fore, followed by a rather vinous taste, maybe burgundy. Some dark ripe fruit in there along with the red wine and then some very dark chocolate in warmer/later samples.

2324,"2008-08-01",3.2,"UPDATED: SEP 7, 2012 12/8/2009 - American brewers put out a wonderful selection of Christmas seasonals, but they always seem to pale in comparison to the classy heralds of the seasons festivities that march their way across the Atlantic to our beer stashes. At the front of the pack is our dear and beloved St. Bernardus monk, pointing diligently (to where? nobody knows) and fancying a Santa cap for the occasion. The beer, too, sports a thick and heavy hat with heavy lacing, and the St. Bernardus Christmas Ale is that particular shade of deep, oiled and aged wood that borders on black, but flickers back to brown with a blink and a wipe of an eye. A medley of dessert smells and Christmas kitchen delights march out of the glass - sweet red grapes, sugary licorice, grape juice and sweet raisins that yield their hyper-concentrated sugars between eagerly chomping teeth. This is far, far sweeter than anything else Ive had from St. Bernardus. It is probably a celebratory push into the seasons traditional gluttony, and Im ready to celebrate. Sadly, we all know that feeling of withdrawal after Christmas is done, and we have to shelve our ever present plates of cookies and brownies. These confections, usually relegated to the occasional dessert, have been accessories to our lives, jumping down our gullets every time we pass the plate on the trip between rooms. The St. Bernardus speeds up the crushing blow of the end of Christmas in the flavor, where all the promises of the aroma have been turned up to 11. Carbonation plagues the palate, and jarring tastes of bad hard candy and cough syrup and a clumsy flavor of grape juice coat the tongue in a cloying carol to flavors commonly found in Christmas brews. It is too much - sweet and sugary, like too many gingerbread cookies in the wee hours of the morning, and a lingering, sticky aftertaste that clings to you like so much late night snacking guilt. There is a limit, I think, to how far these lovely Belgian Christmas ales can go, and the St. Bernardus pushes it past that limit and well beyond. I much prefer the monk without his Christmas cap.

8/1/2008 - FOOMF!  The pour on this festive brew from St. Bernardus immediately explodes into a mushroom cloud of tasty foam.  After a considerable wait, this hemisphere of bubbles slowly erodes into a huge, volcanic crater, allowing a more passable attempt at drinking the feer without getting foam on my eyebrows.  The aroma is slightly spicy, exhibiting a sturdy whiff of black pepper, cinnamon and the more rounded white pepper, with a squeeze of both lemon and lime lending a Caribbean air.  The whole of the aroma is extremely creamy, and though the scents are prickly, theyre delicious all the same, though I hardly see how this makes for much of a Christmas beer.  The flavor has that same certain Belgian woodiness to it, which can only be wrought delicious by skilled artists, and indeed the workers at St. Bernardus are very skilled.  Most of the wood and dry flavors encountered in the beginning flake off towards the end though, replaced by a boisterous alcohol flavor.  Piercing notes of sharp wood flavors remain through the taste, though, and makes for an appropriately passive and pensive beer for drinking next to a holiday fire.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

St. Bernardus Christmas Ale pours the darkest red imaginable. If this beer is not directly backlit it borders on black. When backlit theres a mahogany hue with tiny carbonation bubbles rushing to the surface. A one finger beige head formed on the pour that had strong staying power from the massive amount of carbonation. Leaves drink lines after each sip. An excellent looking beer.

Smell is full of candy and spice. Brown sugar, gingerbread cookies, some spicy yeast, cinnamon, and dark bread. This beer really does bring out the smells of Winter and Christmas.

The massive carbonation seems to get in the way of the flavors slightly. Its good without a doubt but the carbonation has things moving far too quickly. All the aromas mentioned above are present in the flavor as well and meld nicely. Flavor is slightly more spicy with hints of pepper.

The carbonation is a little too much. Does give a nice frothy mouthfeel but pushes the flavors through too quickly. Leaves a nice tingle on the back of the tongue.

This beer goes down easily and is definately enjoyable. That said, two goblets in a sitting is enough for me.

Another beer of the highest quality from St. Bernardus. Of course thats to be expected. This beer has some really nice Christmas spicing.

Attractive aroma of distinct yeasty bread dough. Smelled a bit like a bakery. Clove and a whiff of banana came out by the by and were accompanied by dark fruits and alcohol. Warm alcohol and lots of bubbles greeted the tongue. Not sweet, but not bone dry, either. Spices and bready malts dominated the flavor as predicted by the aroma. There was plenty of clove and alcohol flavor with a hint of roasty malt and spiced banana bread. Great beer.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"
2324,"2007-12-21",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Festive black pepper seamlessly follows the intelligent dried cocoa, as dates and cherries are amassed to offset the twitching alcohol warming in this, yet another highly successful Belgian Strong Ale from one of the worlds best breweries.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A heavenly tower of unyielding foam thrones and laces within the chalice atop the mahogany-laced darkest of browns.
-Carbonation is frothy and bubbles initially expansive; a little breathing does wonders for the mouthfeel.
-Its fragrance is at first delicate, but bready yeast develops soon enough to embolden the calculated desserty spices.
-Some roasted malt flakes whirl about serenely.
-The entire flavor profile is entirely balanced and the dessert spicing so wisely integrated.
-Cloves are also perceived in the spiciness, but no real spice stands out.
-The fruitiness seems to be slowly candied throughout the tasting.
-This is complex and highly drinkable for its gravity; what else would you expect from St.Bernardus!

2324,"2007-12-20",4.2,"Pours like a rusty version of the Abt 12 with course bubbles and a lively head.  Aroma is lighter and more unripe than a quad.  Actually this is a super dubbel in many ways., with more cherry and fig than roasted chocolate.  The palate sizzles with a popping creamy coating and just a touch of nutmeg.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"
2324,"2007-12-20",4.6,"Pours out a dark brown to settle a nearly mat black with a small sense of brownness to its body. Very heavy looking and an impressively tall capping to top it off of light crispy brown foam thats a bit rough and tumbled. Kinda crunchy looking at first but developes into a moderately creamy bubbleness and density as it sits. It keeps well and stretches all sorts of wonderful lacing that looks of wet powdered sugar.

Nice lofty aroma of cookie dough and spice. Crisp yet round with a full on malt tilt of breads and dark fruits. Mostly figgy, touch of raisin, perhaps some dates and molasses covering the big breadyness. Nice yeastyness to it which seems to be adding a root beerish type of hints to its dryness. Slender hops add some grassyness to its spicy complexity which included some anise, cinnamon, mint, and ginger cookies.

Flavors are bold, lasting and carry alot of what the smell leads to with its big maltyness and yeastified balance. Firm grip of dark candish malts leads right in with a nice holiday cake-like dimension of figgyness first, then dark cherry, dates, chocolate covered raisins, and then the peppy spices. Notes of root beer, anise, pepper, carrot cake, and ginger make their way in and out of the malty doughy darkness but linger mostly across its finish with a slender, delicately woven dryness of grassy hops. Pretty damn solid! Perhaps not quite a match to the Abt 12, but damn if its not close! 

Feel is big, bold, and beautiful. The girth is massive in the body of this stuff. Heavy yet smooth, crunchy and crisp yet creamy with a whole lotta malts to create an exceedingly thick bread/cake-like structure of body. Not to mention the subtle details of yeasty play, dark fruity tang, perfectly intensed warmness, hoppy dryness, and spice. Which all lasts forever and a day the second it spills on to your palate.

Nose is certainly rich for the season with some Belgian chocolates, apple pie, nutmeg, clove, light hazlenut, and a touch of earthy hops.  Flavor is certainly similarly rich; initial flavors include cooked apples, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove, almost like spicy apple sauce.  Then the malts come in with lots of Belgian chocolates, faint roast, light date, and light molasses; by the finish a decent earthy hop presence settles in with some hazlenut.  Palate is medium-full, lively, and velvety with only a hint at some warmth in the finish.  By the finish, the spices diminish some, the chocolates linger along with the date and nutty notes, and the earthy bitterness and warming notes round out the long finish.  Actually a pretty nice Christmas beer with a rich malt apalte and nice spicing to back it up.  A bit too much carbonation and a tad thin too fit into the great Belgian category, but it is a fitting beer for the season.

2324,"2007-12-01",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2007 Best By 09/08/2012, Sampled December 2007
Served only lightly chilled, the beer is clearly well carbonated as even a reasonably careful pour produces a billowing, slightly over-flowing, initially seven-finger thick, lightly browned, tan colored head of foam that slowly recedes while leaving a delicate lacing pattern on the sides of my 30cl Tripel Karmeliet tulip.  the beer sits in my glass a burnt, amber tinged, very dark brown color, but shows a brilliantly clear, dark ruby hue when held up to the light.  In passing inspection of the nose, aromas of dark fruit and spices mix quite equally.  A deeper draught of the nose reveals aromas of raisins, figs, concentrated plum, brown sugar, sweet cola, clove, touches of allspice, a hint of molasses, dark chocolate, light ginger or maybe really galangal and even some cardamom like notes.  The aroma ends up being a bit more focused on the dark, caramelized fruit notes with just a backdrop of spice character that leaves no doubt that this is a Belgian yeast strain.

The carbonation provides a prickly, lightening effect to what is really a medium full beer.  It does not drink as heavy as the 10% alcohol might suggest, but is certainly has that Belgian lightness that is in many of the better made strong beers from their.  The beer is definitely sweet, which accentuates the quite noticeable dark fruit character; caramelized plums, figs, raisins and even some apple flavors are individually noticeable.  The beer finishes with a mix of spiciness and warming alcohol that is a touch pepper-like, with some spicy ginger, toasty brandy & rum, and some turpene driven phenolic clove / cardamom notes.  Bread like malt notes reminiscent of toasted bread, hints of browned-whole-grain bread, touches of rye, caramelized-dark German bread, biscuit malt and roasted / broiled / concentrated figs.

The second pour has just as voluminous a head as the first, and the beer, a little more chilled now, tastes even a bit lighter than it did initially.  The ample carbonation focuses the flavors more on the peppery spice notes, while softening the rich fruitiness that is there after it has mellowed.  This is certainly a contemplative brew; I could wish for a bit more malt complexity in the flavor (at times the alcohol and spiciness can be a little too much), but the nose really is quite intriguing.  While I certainly enjoy the lightness / heft of this brew as is, it seems to be missing a bit of richness that could add a bit more balance (these are not necessarily opposing characters though as some richness could be added without making this beer feel heavier).

2324,"2007-11-29",3.1,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle.  Deep mahogany-red pour; greyish skin disseminates slowly.  Varied nuances on the nose thinly veil what seems to be a somewhat empty foundation; orange peel, ginger, juniper, cranberry bread, and almond frosting project loudly.  These, however, are the entire bit, though they would seem to better serve as tangential tones.  Taste is surprisingly sprightly, though still bold; plenty of banana sweetness with clove, spruce, and sweet nuts in dates and young coffee beans.  Lacks depth or any indication of rich quality; this seems to be a simple, lukewarm dubbel at its heart.  Somewhat light in the mouth, sharply carbonated, and again, lacking in core character.  A bit more brawniness of malt would do wonders for it; as is, its rather disappointing, enjoyable as it still is.  Thanks for sharing, Brian!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Has a nice foamy head(maybe a bit too much but it doesnt hide away too fast), and the caramel brown is awfully nice. Very fruity smell with raisins, reminds me of dark fruits. I also smell figs, and malts. The smell is also accompanied by a strong aroma of alcohol. I was expecting this due to the fact that the Abt 12 has this characteristic. VERY CARBONATED, it sizzles on my tongue. Too carbonated. The flavors are what you would expect, fruit; the raisins and the plums are quite pleasant. The malt smoothness is there and the yeast is slightly noticeable. The beer is great but the carbonation is ridiculous.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

Brisk aromas of ripe berries, spicey bitters, and bubblegum. Full nectar with the kind of carbonation that needs to be coaxed out but lending to a rich and creamy texture. This brew is intense, forthright, and generous. The flavors come at me like machinegun fire. Bright spicey clove,  cinnamon, and licorice. Ripe melon, plumb, blackcherry, rasin, nectarine, rock minerals, and creamy butter. A  moderate hop profile brings out the spicey character but never overdoing it. The big malty backbone supports the hive allowing everyone to be heard. Its only mildly sweet and very well balanced. This brew says Happy Christmas everytime I take a sip.

Fortunately, the thing doesnt last too long. As the bubbles pop they release a cola-ish aroma which covers up the huge spice notes I got upon opening the bottle. When theyre done, those spices come back--nutmeg and cinnamon with a touch of cardamom. Theres also a good deal of dark fruit and pronounced brown sugar notes. Good cheer abounds.

Nose is a big fat bubble gum and dark fruit runaround; not sure if it could maybe stand to settle down a bit and soften, but its definitely pleasant enough. This IS a festive party beer, after all.

2324,"2007-11-02",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2016 The classic St. Bernardus packaging was themed in red and green on this bomber, and the jolly monk had donned a Santa Claus hat as snow covered the brewery shield.  Is this going to really be bringing heavenly nectar within reach as promised?  There was only one way to find out.

The cork came off with a loud pop, but the beer stayed put inside the bomber.  As I poured it into a St. Bernardus goblet, the beer was murky brown in color, and the head was only one finger tall.  The aroma was heavy with anise and had some banana notes as well.  The taste seemed like a watery version of the Abt 12, except it seemed almost salty.  The dark malts seemed to be struggling to rise above the huge carbonation sting.  There were overtones raisins, figs, red apples, and brown sugar, but everything seemed to be diluted with club soda.  The alcohol was well hidden as expected.  There was some earthy yeast flavor in the taste as well.  Id say that this was quite a complex beer, but not all aspects of complexity were working towards a cohesive whole.  As it warmed up some, the carbonation became more subdued, allowing me to appreciate the flavors better.  Medium full mouthfeel was good, but never approached that velvety smoothness of the exceptional quadruples.

A good beer, but pales in comparison with its other illustrious brethren.  Not a fair standard I suppose, since most other beers do as well.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Lots of visible carbonation.  The entire glass was covered in a complete curtain of lacing, though Im not sure thats an accurate word to describe a soild covering.  Aroma is typical Belgian Stong Ale, very fruity with lots of yeast influence.  Light raisin and plum, a little brown sugar, and some light alcohol.  The alcohol influence is a little bit much for the flavor.  It doesnt have the depth and complexity of say the St B 12 that can hide that level of alcohol.  Surprisingly thin on flavor even.  Just a light brown sugar and fruitiness up front fading to a slightly yeasty alcohol thinned finish.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and when let to breathe developed a nice soft carbonation.  A little thinner than I expected.  Save for the alcohol, I think that this had the depth and complexity of flavor that would warrant just calling this a Belgian Ale.  Maybe a little cellar time would tone down the alcohol flavor some.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

2324,"2006-12-26",3.4,"Bottle. Characteristic from St. Bernardus is to be found in this one as well, with a slight Christmas spicy feel to it. Reddish brown colour with a big head. Mostly lasting and left some nice lacing. Mouth feel has much more alcoholic appearance then the ABT 12. It is impossible not to compare it with one of my all time favourite beers. Aroma is medium malty with some hops to it. Caramel, liquorish, candies, cinnamon and dry fruit. Medium bodied as it lacks the complexity of its bigger brother. Slightly syrupy texture with a lively carbonation. Medium sweet with a medium sweet finish. Kind of disappointing when you had the ABT 12 to compare it with.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Grovlam"
2324,"2006-12-25",3.3,"75 cL bottle. Pours muddy brown/amber red with light brown and quickly disappearing head. Aroma is sweet, hops and caramel malt and elements of alcohol. Taste is caramel, fruit, alcohol and malts. Beer is slightly over-carbonated, might however be a good thing for the heavy x-mas food. Does not have a complex taste and after-taste as the description indicates. Ordinary belgian x-mas ale.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"

2324,"2006-12-19",2.9,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2010 Re-rating after KBF 09. Quite sweet with a light bitterness and loads of cinnamon. Lots. Takes a great classic and ruins it with too much spice. Old rate: Last gulps from the last bottle of it at the Kerstbierfestival in Essen. I had high expectations, since the St. B 12 is one of my all-time favorites. But here I was disappointed. Its lighter, clearer, much less complex in flavor. Its dominant, saving trait is a spiciness. Decently bitter finish, notable alcohol. Little malt. Maybe there is a reason they didnt want to sell it in Belgum... Glad I could try it, anyway.","Berlin, GERMANY","JoeinDahlem"

2324,"2006-12-17",3.7,"Good, but shortlived yellow head over dark-mahogany beer. Nuts, peanuts, alcohol & fusels, and some caramel-like sweetness, but fading out. Sweet taste, with a hint at sourish fruitiness. Dark malts, dark - nearly outfermented - candi sugar, and some fatty acids in the finish. Very full-bodied, alcohol in the retronasal build-up. Basically quite good, but not overwhelming beer. St. Bernard is a brewery that, IMO, does it regular beers better than its specials.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
