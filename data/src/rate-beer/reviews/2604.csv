2604,"2017-04-04",4.7,"Love this beer! Pours a pale amber color. A perfect balance of hoppy and wheat beers.

2604,"2016-10-05",3.0,"Cans and Beer, Moscow tap: pours copper with a white head. Aroma is light citrus and malts. Taste is kind of citrusy and a tad sweet. This beer is confusing because you just expect every beer in Russia to be an IPA. This is also not a real kristalweizen. Hard to say what it is.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

Pours almost clear orange with a medium-sized off-white head. Aroma of grapefruit and lemon. Taste is fruity with spices followed by a soft bitter finish.
