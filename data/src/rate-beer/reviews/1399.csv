1399,"2016-06-25",3.3,"[8307-20160520] Tap. Light toasted grains aroma. Slightly hazy, dark mahogany brown red body with a medium-lasting foamy mocha head. Roasted coffee grains and toasted multigrain bread flavour. Medium-full body is fairly bitter. Interesting. (6/3/7/3/14) 3.3

1399,"2016-06-22",3.3,"2016-05-20. Crisp dark brown body, small tan head. Aroma of dusty caramel malt. Flavour is malt forward, light notes of dark fruits, dusty malt, hint of caramel and a very slight tangy undercurrent. Average bodied palate, soft carbonation. Decent. 7/3/6-7/3/14 On tap at The Brewery, Christchurch, NZ.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
1399,"2014-10-19",3.4,"Tried on tap at The Brewery. Clear dark brown body with tan head. Caramel and coffee on the nose with more coffee coming through in the taste. Not usually a fan of this style but I enjoyed this one.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","bluevegie"
1399,"2014-02-07",3.6,"The head is good, body dark brown, almost black. It smells roasty, darkmalty, aromatic, very nice. The taste is malty, darkmalty, aromatic, bit dry-roasty. Quite good. 3.6","Otorohanga, NEW ZEALAND","kiwianer"
1399,"2014-01-24",3.3,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2014 Another 10th rating! This is an interesting beer, somehow very un-Dunkel, in my view and smell and taste. Dark, squirrel brown, much more dense in appearance than traditional Munich Dunkel. Little to say on the aroma, except for a leather and mushrooms, very earthy, but all very subtle. The flavours are dark chocolate, cofee, hazelnuts, ashes, and none of that Munich malt that can often be just too boring. All flavours very mild too. Perhaps because it was a taster among other beers at the CBD bar, I could detect no bitterness at all. Felt more like a mild ale.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"
1399,"2014-01-23",3.5,"On tap @ Cassels. New Zealand holiday 2011-12. Old notes. Aroma has some toasty, chocolate malt tones. Almost black coloured beer with an off-white, thin head. The taste is slightly bitter, has the toasty chocolate. Nicely balanced beer.","Baarn, NETHERLANDS","skortila"
1399,"2013-08-13",4.0,"Draft at CBD Bar. Very dark clear maroon color, beige head, solid lacing. Aroma of rich dark cocoa and caffe macchiato. Taste is brownies and Italian coffee soda with soft carbonation. Very tasty.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
1399,"2013-03-22",4.0,"Im biased because Im horrified in the prolific use of burnt malt in otherwise a delicious industry. If you want just like a chocolate milkshake but messy then Id generally take Baileys in the Coco Pops before anything other than the most strangely alluring darks. I taste them to satisfy scientific curiosity and cant help but rate this Dunkel. Clean and easy, none of the citrus or otherwise acidity that plagues a weaker brew. May my palate grow that I may enjoy it fully.","NEW ZEALAND","horotane"

Dark ruby brown with light body and medium carbonation. Digestive biscuit malt and a touch of chocolate.","NORTHERN IRELAND","Beersiveknown"
1399,"2012-02-01",4.0,"Poured on tap at the brewery its made, this beer has a deep red colour, minimal if any hop character but a huge malt presence and expected amount of residual sweetness. The initial taste is chocolate and coffee with pleasant bitterness, the finish is sweet and enjoyable and leaves you wanting more. Head retention is good.","","scrowlerAA"
1399,"2012-02-01",3.6,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2012 Id like to re-taste it, dont remember much. But in my memory, it was a delight!","Grenoble, FRANCE","deusax"

1399,"2011-06-17",2.3,"Bought 2 bottles. Both fizzed hopefully when opening but would not get a head at all unless aggressively poured - even then it dissipated rapidly.
Excellent colour - bold and dark
Tastewise it left a lot to be desired. Flat tasting and nothing screaming to be drunk...","NEW ZEALAND","kiwinewt"
1399,"2011-05-19",3.9,"Upon pouring the head appears and then disappears leaving just a fond memory, however the beer itself is a gorgeous deep chocolate black with a lovely ruby port  tone shining through the stem of the glass. When you get over the sacred ruby glow and stick your nose over the glass you get a huge pinch of strong powdered cocoa, vanilla cinnamon and rosewood. Look, temperature is everything with the aroma here. It was too cold initially and I had to let it warm in my hand for  few minutes before the aroma eruption began. Smells toothsome.
Theres an intriguing and confusing flurry of flavours when you taste. Rhubarb, coffee, caramel, berries and then it settles into cocoa and freshly ground coffee. It isnt sweet, but not especially dry either. It is nicely balanced and quite satisfying. If I hadnt tried the ESB from this brewer Id have cheerfully asserted this to be Cassels best. As it stands it is a lovely beer. Nourishing and splendid.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
