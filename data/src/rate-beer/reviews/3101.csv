3101,"2017-05-15",3.9,"33cl bb:opdruk fles? merci RW80 for this luscious local. - Bref: supremely drinkable ImpPorter with subtle gastronomical peaty notes, rather than actual smoke, and a rare sense of natural carbonation for a Low countries cover. - Aroma of bayleaf and peat-spiked earthy chocolate milk. Silky, relaxed mouthfeel: drinks like a luxury-dry Cécémel. The smoke adds some refined umami textures to contour the understated bitter chocolate and liquorice flavours, while a yeast character lurks underneath its silky surface. The smoke as peat adds accents of savoury root vegetable and bouillon, celeriac, sage, bayleaf and smoked trout without overpowering.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

Aroma:

Medium aroma of liquorice, chocolate, roasted malts, coffee and smoke.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with liquorice and chocolate; ends slightly bitter with roasted malts, coffee and smoke.
