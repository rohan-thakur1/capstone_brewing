2201,"2017-01-25",3.8,"12oz bottle at my Son-in-Laws place in Orange County on 24th Jan 2017. Really enjoyed this. Brass like amber colour with not much of a head. Malty molasses rule the nose and flavour with caramel notes winning over slight toffee esters and hints. Nice balance, but still too sweet for some people, just right for me.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"
2201,"2016-09-21",3.3,"Draft at BBQ. Pours Amber with a thin head. Bready sweet and light toasty grainy base, very low bitterness, some straw, and lingering toasted grains. Decent.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
2201,"2015-10-02",3.4,"Not bad, a little floral. Decent malty flavor but a little on the watery side.

2201,"2015-09-18",3.4,"12oz bottle pours with a clear deep gold body that has a copper hued core and supports a modest tan head of foam. The aroma offers up caramel malts, biscuit like malts and thin soft sweet smelling pear and apple fruity esters. The taste delivers a blend of caramel malts, biscuit malts, a bit of roasted malts and then mild vague bitter hoppiness. To midway a thin layer of fruity esters surfaces with sweet notes like pears, red apples and figs come to the surface. This various malts and mild fruity esters hang on deep into the after taste. Pretty nice.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
2201,"2015-09-16",3.2,"12oz bottle, Copper orange like color. Malty grains with herbal hop aromas. Earthy grainy taste up front with lite bitterness. This has a grainy like finish also. Doesnt work for me.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","beerbastard"
2201,"2015-04-18",3.3,"12oz bottle. Amber-Orange with little white head. Caramel malt aroma and a little honey. The taste is a little sweeter than most of the style, but it isnt overpowering. Malt, honey, floral. Enjoyable.","Bavaria, GERMANY","sturmthis"
2201,"2015-02-12",3.2,"Pours clear medium amber with a frothy off-white head. Aroma has cereal malt, earthy, herbal, orange candy, caramel, and a bit of oxidation.

2201,"2015-01-27",3.3,"Pretty decent little beer, far from the best tho. Copper colored beer, no lacing, small head fades off, decent aroma, malty, strong. Taste is pretty good, reminds me of fruit and scotch alright.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Caytinator"
2201,"2015-01-11",4.1,"Solid. A nice lager. Has a bit more kick than expected in this style, and wouldnt mind a wee more malt flavor.","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","mikedR"
2201,"2014-11-04",2.9,"This is an acceptable seasonal offering. The potentially crisp, caramel, toasty aspect of the flavor is blunted by a honey like sweetness that takes it in the wrong direction as far as I am concerned. Not bad. Just not to my liking.","Los Gatos, California, USA","loubar"
2201,"2014-09-18",3.2,"A pretty nice rendition of the style. Aroma is malt driven, light bread and honey. The color and palate are light, but the flavor comes through a little more with a touch of extra richness.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
2201,"2014-09-15",3.5,"24 oz sample on tap at The Burger Saloon in Woodland. Aroma has some sweet toffee and caramel. Lightly metallic, too. Transparent copper-Orange body with a small, cream-colored head. Starts with a moderately sweet, nutty, and husky maltiness. Light metallic twang in the middle . Finishes a little herbal, and slightly dry. Not shabby.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
2201,"2013-11-14",3.7,"12 oz. bottle. It pours a nice orange color with an off white head. The aroma is very pleasant with dry, toasty bread and light Munich malt derived plum fruit. The flavor is the same. Dry and toasty with a decent dose of earthy bitterness. Very malty yet dry. Smooth full bodied with a snappy finish. Great Oktoberfest.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
2201,"2013-10-29",4.2,"This is a really good Oktoberfest. Malty and grassy, yet with just the right amount of sweetness. A filling beer, but quite right for the season. A cloudy-ish orange color.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"

2201,"2013-09-16",3.3,"Vegas Total Wine bottle. First Hangar 24 beer and I must say Im a fan. Good fest beer with caramel malt and some spice. Maybe a little ""dusty"" in the aroma. Pleasant.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"

2201,"2013-01-05",3.4,"On tap at the LAX Marriott, which has a surprisingly rad beer selection. Wasnt too thrilled that this was the H24 seasonal, but it turned out to be far better than the usual marzen. In some ways it reminded me of the Foothills version, which is bracingly hoppy to balance out sweet malts. Enjoyable, especially for the style.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
2201,"2012-12-03",3.2,"Bottle... Clear amber ale with a small, wispy, stubborn, white head. The aroma furnishes notes of orange blossom honey, marmalade and biscuit accompanied by a lightly earthy factor. Full-bodied with restrained carbonation. The flavor is a swirl of marmalade, toffee, honey and a mild notation of earthy bitterness. The sweet, malty finish is a touch medicinal. Bottle courtesy of JoeTheYounger!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2201,"2012-11-28",4.1,"12oz bottle, no date from Olive Tree in OB a couple months back. Dunno how I have not rated this yet--glad I checked. Clear copper orange with a  small creamy beige head, good retention. Lager yeast and plenty of toasted malt and grain make up the aroma, simple but skillfully done. Flavor follows suit with just a tinge of grape, not much in the way of hops. The finish is dry, bitterness at a 2-3.Light to moderate carbonation with a medium body. Damn fine beer. These guys are wonderful.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

2201,"2012-10-23",3.5,"Rich malty German lager aroma from a beautiful crystal clear pumpkin orange/bronze body with a thin white head.   Caramel malt and light sweetness follow with a surprisingly floral hop taste thats not quite appropriate here but still tastes good.  Earthy hop bitterness hits the tongue and balances the malt nicely.  Finishes clean and sweet.   A good German style lager if not quite to style.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"
2201,"2012-10-23",3.4,"Bottle. Pours golden amber with off white head. Nose and taste of sweet grain, sweet malt, sweet corn, light caramel and vanilla. Medium body.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
2201,"2012-10-06",3.6,"Bottle from South Bay Liquor: Appeared as a medium golden/amber hue with a foamy topping of head. Aroma was simple with a pleasant base of malts but also allows room for a slight profile of hops. The drink is solid marzen style with a moderate delivery of subtle sweet malts brewed in a crisp and clean lager style. Good to find a new Oktoberfest beer while Oktoberfest is still happening.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"
2201,"2012-10-01",3.3,"Draft: Poured an orange copper color with a white head. Aroma was sweet spice and grain. Taste was refreshing blend of sweet grain and malts.","Wasilla, Alaska, USA","SHIG"

A touch of toffee sweetness, floral and spicy hops, and a light yeastiness.  The flavor is really heavy on the bread.  Lots of toffee and toast with a moderate sweetness.

2201,"2010-11-28",3.6,"A dark golden marzen brewed first in 2010.  Aromatic and tasting strongly of malt this beer needs a good breather before drinking deeply.  There are a few sharp tastes in the beer that detract but overall its a nice high alcohol rendition of the German classic.","California, USA","KingGerman"
2201,"2010-11-19",3.7,"1 liter growler thanks to Tim, pours caramel with a medium tan head.  Aroma is caramel malt, some toffee, very nutty with corn and grassy hops.  Flavor is rich caramel malt, creamy grass and hay with a toffee and grass finish that lingers for a bit.  The carbonation is spot on, highly drinkable with just enough going on to make it interesting.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","fata2683"
