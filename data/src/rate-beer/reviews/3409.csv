3409,"2017-06-22",4.2,"2013/Jan. Cellared. Purchased in Chicago 3 months fresh. Nice strong carbonation noise on breaking the seal. I was worried it was going to spray all over the place. Ruby with just slight brown hues. Short, ample small bubble off white head with mild lacing. Lots of fast moving carbonation. This has stood up exceptionally. Nose is heavy with raspberry, green leaves, and yeast. Lots of apple tart, raspberry, and a background nutty toast on the palate. Its obviously a sour, so the nuances of acid, and fruit. Traces of wood, whiff of smoke. Faint charred sugars in the background, likely from contact with hot surfaces during the boil. Faint menthol/mint in the finish, with notes of black tea. Excellent.","Southampton, Ontario, CANADA","Crockett"

3409,"2014-02-19",4.0,"(Note: Im not quite sure I am reviewing the right beer. My bottle is labeled ""Panil Baririquee"" but has the label of the bottle shown in the ""Barriquee Reserve"" post... )
The beer pours a gorgeous, muddled pink, almost like a fruited Berliner Weisse. It sits in the glass a regal, dark purple color with maroon and ruby hues. The beer pours with a head of miniscule, creamy white bubbles that form a pillow, and then quickly settles into a fat scrim around the beer. In body, the beer is dark and hazy, but clear of particles and cloudiness. On the nose, the beer smells of light vinegar, cherries, leather, and nearly vinous. Touches of grape and soft plum dance on the edges of the scent along with rich vanilla from the oak. The funky leather and cherry scents are earthy and rich with vinegar, which I adore, but they are also constrained and mellow. The nose of this beer revels in subtle complexity; it is funky, but not in a way that would kick your nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes tart with acidity, sweet with fruity malt, and bitter with oak tannin. The oak leaves a strange twinge to the pucker in your cheeks. The beer finishes dry and tannic. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet plum juice, tinged with tart cherry leather, this bulls head on into a wall of rich, oak tannin that blankets the middle of the sip, all but obliterating the fruity notes and bringing vanilla, earth and finally a touch of chocolate into play. Touches of grape juice and rich red wine can also be sensed in the start of the sip, while the finish is long and decadent with oak, vanilla, touches of tart grapes, and bitter herbal tannin. The aftertaste is hard to distinguish from the finish, as the beer has tremendous lasting power in the mouth. For all intents and purposes, the finish and the aftertaste are the same. In body, the beer is on the light side of medium, with a middling carbonation that gives a nice pillow to the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth, if a bit watery, providing superb drinkability until the beer hits the back of the palate. In the back, the tannin does touch with a quick bite of astringency, but this quickly fades to just leave a bit of tightness in the tongue. The mouth is left slightly dry, with just a touch of saliva oozing in to cancel the lingering acidity of the beer. Overall, this is yet another superb Flanders Red. This particular beer revels in the rich character it gained from unique Bordeaux cognac barrels. Admittedly, I have not drank a lot of cognac from Bordeaux (I thought Cognac could only be made in a region surrounding the town of Cognac?) but I think an experienced Cognac drinker would definitely find subtle hints within this beer reminiscent of that drink. This is a Flanders Red of subtle intrigue and beauty, like a fine red wine. It unfurled on my tongue like a puzzle, and I very much enjoyed that. My chief complaint with the beer comes from its thinness. I want my Flanders Reds to be medium bodied, and this one is just a little too far below this bench mark for me. It is superbly drinkable, but loses a little oomf. The beers tannic structure also allows it to grip the mouth quite nicely, and provides some amazing complexities, though it is a little too raw for my personal tastes. In the end though, its a great Flanders red.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

Then we have ripe, fruity tartness...enticingly sour, followed by a dry, lingering bitterness that is subtle but also tannic and quite wine-like. Old beer envelopes the mouth and nose. The mouthfeel is tremendous, like a slick or velvet or oily characteristic. Full and lush and yummy mouthfeel. This is an incredibly delicious and complex brew.

These negative notes come out when drinking with the mouth open, allowing air to waft over the tongue and up to the nose, leading me to believe they are actually properties of the aroma.

Pours copper/light brown, perfectly clear, with just a tiny off-white head.
Aroma is quite intense, tartness dominates, accompanied with sour berries, raspberries as well, a hint of grapes skin in the end.
Taste is also tart upfront, but not acetic, then come wild funky notes, mixed with dry wine and grape juice. After warming up raspberries show up, as well as a bit of oaky vanilla character.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium-light carbonated.
Aftertaste is of funk&sourness, with a faint warming alcohol sensation at the back.
Overall, a well balanced, not too sour indeed, pretty drinkable and rather tasty beer.

Nope, its simply a sour ale in a dark green wine bottle with some plastic around the cap and the content looking really dark.

Nice active carbonation of medium-size bubbles becoming smaller and smaller as it goes. Aromas of red apples, cherries, with some notes of sourness and tartiness. Quite a sour taste at first. Then fruity with some currant, cherries ending quickly with a little malt. The alcohol is totally hidden and the mouthfeel a bit thin. Nonetheless, refreshing at room temperature. A decent Flemish sour from Italy, which I was not expecting to be as good.

Enticing wet straw, barnyard smell that covers the aroma of rotting cherries. I used to pick cherries in Michigan as a kid and this brings me right back to sitting in those trees and eating Montmorency cherries until my mouth hurt. 
A bitter sourness that clings to your mouth long after you sip and leaves you sucking your teeth.
Paired with dinner this beer shined with sauteed lemon asparagus and chicken Parmesan. The asparagus brought the fruit forward, quelling the acidity to a pleasant bite.

Nose is a bit of vinegar and red wine; nice, but perhaps not quite as strong as you get from some similar sours.    The flavor is sour with some twangy vinegar funk and a bit of candied sweetness on the tale end.  Honestly, Id prefer something with a bit more sourness, as it isnt quite as biting as you can find elsewhere in the style.  Perhaps I waited a bit too long to drink this for my taste.  Also, the mouthfeel is a bit light for me.  The carbonation seems to fade relatively quickly, and youre left with a bit of a thin consistency.

Nose: woody with a bit of horse and farm in the back. Eyes tickle/water from acidic fusels. Grows more funk as warms up with a nice addition of old leather freshly oiled. Grape and plum skins, hold the flesh please. Mustiness dominates the back.

Palate: grabs middle of tongue and doesnt let go, already drying from quaff numero uno. Plums and grape skins lead into wood, leather, and must which finish with the fruity remains of stems and skins. Quaff and repeat. Nice clean mouthfeel which leaves sides of cheeks tingling. Little on the breath, but grows more earthen the further along we venture together. Lovely balance.

Final Thoughts: Id hear numerous good things about this beer which I am quite pleased to say lived up to every bit of its hype. Further proof that Italy cares as much about the gourmand burgundian welfare of their beer as they do their wine and food.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Off-red brown in the glass with minimal traces of carbonation and lacing hugging the edges of the glass.  Multiple layers of smooth but ever so slightly increasing tartness in the taste.  Some notes are muted fruit and others are sharp and dry.

3409,"2010-05-08",3.9,"2008 Vintage. Batch 10 Bottle #731.  Pours a reddish chestnut color with very little froth.  Solid nose with oak, vinegar and cherry notes.  Flavor is similar, but the wood character is a bit more subdued.  I definitely get substantially more of the acetic or balsamic vinegar flavor than the sour lacto flavor.  The cherries are prominent towards the end of the sip.  Carbonation is medium and the palate is slightly thin.  Ends on a long, dry and mildly sour note.  Overall this is an excellent beer and could be considered a session beer for a Flemish Red style in that it isnt too extreme.  For my personal preference Id much rather have a La Folie or another Flemish Red with a stronger lacto addition and more sour flavor.  The other drawback for this one is that its a bit taxing on the wallet and doesnt really stand out as exceptionally unique.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"

Aromas of oak, wine, horsey barnyard stuff, over sour cherry, dark fruits, earth. Man, the aroma is just freaking killer. Peat, oak and very sour hits the taste buds first followed by a very woody and vinous dark middle, dark fruits and vanilla. I wrote down ""This is great! Best sour ever!"" That very well might be true. Medium sour after taste, leaves my mouth happy with the absence of alcohol.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

3409,"2009-06-07",3.3,"Bottle, shared with my family on day of college graduation.  Appears muddy brown-red with ominously little head.  Aroma is of tart cherry, white vinegar, and some miscellaneous sour fruit.  The flavors present are decent, much more vinegary then I was expecting.  The finish is full of sour fruit and a bit of fruit-peel bitterness.  Unfortunately, I really objected to this beers mouthfeel.  It starts watery and uncarbonated, and never improves.  I found myself taking bigger swigs of this brew just to achieve some kind of fullness from the palate.  Overall, I suppose this is a decent sour  definitely of the vinegary variety  but its shortcomings in palate and appearance are obvious.  I may in the future try another bottle to re-evaluate.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

Taste at first is overwhelmed by sour and vinegary notes but then moves to some spicy alcohol and finishes with strong oak. Over time, the sourness becomes less pungent and astringent and more like red wine with the wood and alcohol presence of port.

I had a debate as to what to drink after two such sensational Cantillon beers.  Deciding that another geuze would do me in I opted for a slightly less aggressive option in the Panil.  Having seen it around town I have always passed due to the high price.  Now that Ive had a sample I may decide to pick one up at some point for a special occasion.

Aroma / Appearance - The deep red body was a stark contrast to the lighter colored lambics.  A thin head graced the top covering sour cherries, oak and wet teak.  A maltiness perveded the headspace.  While not as dry or intense as the lambics it wasnt subtle either.

Flavor / Palate - Black cherries contrasted nicely with dry wood and old hops.  Not as harsh as I expected it was only a bit sour.  The semi-sweet chocolate finish accented a solid and cohesive taste profile.  I would place it a step or two below Rodenbach Grand Cru both based on price and taste.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pours a very dark brown amber. Looks ruby tinted when held to light. Nose is mild cherry woods. Stays consistent and never waivers. Flavor is mildy sour. Mild wood character. Really; mild is the key word here. Feel is thick a bit on the liquid and good on the bubble. Overall pretty drinkable. Seems a bit rough around the edges (though it isnt much really). Definitely a very good version of the style, but not the absolute greatest. This might be a good introductory beer for newcomers to the style.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","RblWthACoz"

Deep dark amber brown with a very good off white head and lots of attractive lace. Very similar aroma to the mild but definitely more sour, would prefer more brett though. The characteristic stamp of Panil creosote is there as expected. A really nice smelling beer. In the mouth it is a very different animal to the mild with an awesome sourness that stings the edges of the palate in a really good way. Some of the best wooden notes I have experienced that balances so well with the sourness and makes it into a real stunner. Its worth every bit of the respect that it gets and although it is very similar to the other two versions, the subtle differences really set it apart. My god that wood and sourness! Wonderfully clean, refreshing mouthfeel and an all round unique experience. Harry, I cant thank you enough for your generosity.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

Not much lace, and not much left on top after walking across the room. Very soft and gentle vinegar tartness on the nose--comparatively mild when put next to some of the monster belgian noses you get in the sourer styles. Nearly flat. Almost watery body.

3409,"2007-12-17",3.4,"2006 bottle consumed December 2007.  Pours a mostly clear crimson-purple body.  The last pour was considerably more cloudy, as the yeast sediment was unavoidable.  There is no foamy head, just a small gathering of crystal clear bubbles that quickly dissipate, leaving a smooth, glassy surface.  Zero lacing.  The aroma is fruity and vinous, with sour cherries, red grapes and mildy funky yeast that takes on a sour dairy-like quality.  The flavor is sufficiently sour and increasingly vinous.  Grapes and cherries again dominate, and the dairy reveals itself as plain yogurt.  Oak and vanilla really pick up on the palate.  The mouthfeel is reminiscent of an Oregon Pinot Noir, teetering just on the lighter side of medium bodied.  Finishes short and sour.  Not as intensely sour as I was expecting, or hoping for.  A bit too vinous for me.  Like the Bon Chien 2005,  it is a solid beer, but I think Id reach for a glass of wine before I went for this one again.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Strong sour cherry taste with a bit of roast and lactic acid, earthy chocolate and a great, rounding wood flavor.  Classy vinegar and a nice wild attitude.  Little sweetness, and despite the great sourness, very drinkable.  Still not as aggressively sour as some others; falls somewhere in the middle of the continuum for oude bruins.

The tartness and funk are solid, but kind of subdued, when compared to say Rodenbach Grand Cru or New Belgium La Foille. Probably making it more drinkable to someone not familiar with this style.

3409,"2007-09-15",4.0,"2006 Bottle.  Pours like a lighter red wine with a clear dark red-burgandy color and a negligable head leaving soapy notes.  Nose is very vinous as well; not quite the sharp acidity of some other flemishes but certainly filled with some tannins with notes of plum skin, tart black cherries, vanilla, and light earthy oak.  Flavor is again quite vinous; like a cabernet/shiraz blend; lots of plum and soured black cherries, maybe even some currant, with also a touch of red wine vinegar, vanilla, and earthen oak notes.  Palate is like a lighter-bodied red wine; almost medium bodied, quite soft carbonation (almost as if it carbonation was lost somehow), and a decent quenching acidity.  Finishes with lingering tart notes of black cherries, red wine vinegar, and light vanilla.  More like a red wine than any other beer Ive tried, like a cab/shiraz blend more than anything.  If Im rating the beer against other Flemishes, it wasnt my favorite but certainly nice.  If i am rating it as a vinous beer, I seem to like it more than I thought I would.  Excellent balance of fruity, acidic, and acetic flavor but lacks the malt depth of great Flemishes.

The aroma is very rich and complex right from the start, with a deep musky character balanced by overripe fruits. The initial taste is very powerful and funky, like a fine Flanders red, and thankfully not oversweet. As the beer settles in to room temp, a more tart vinous character emerges but stops short of pucker-dom. For the price, this might not be the best value out there but its a really lovely beer.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Aroma is very tart up front with funky bacteria blasting the nostrils, then a fruitiness of sour cherries and oak. The taste adds another dynamic to the puckering sourness and tart cherries, I can really taste the oak now but its mellow enough to be quite nice. A spicy almost peperiness hits the tounge. Then a dash of alcohol and cognac flavor hit at once. The finish ends with a light heat of alcohol in the last sip with the sourness trailing off with it. Excellent beer and would gladly have again.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","rayg1"

Virtually astounding aroma, complex and nearly confounding, with a blend of elements including oak, red grape, tart black cherry, blood orange, leather, faint malt vinegar, cider, earthiness, some herbal, leafy tones oddly reminscent of dill, bay leaf and tea,  perhaps some faint chamomile and licorice.  Deep, dark garnet color, clear, with a mostly lasting, uneven, bubbly head and traces of lacing.  Flavor virtually explodes upon the palate with tartness and dark fruitiness, further aged wood and vinous, acetic tones throughout, with a lightly puckering sourness, faintly spicy, peppery alcohol and a drying effect on the palate.

Dusty?  Maybe some barnyard?  A thin body, with low carbonation and perhaps just a touch of chalkiness, though not offensive in mouthfeel.  The flavor is a bit gentler in the mouth than in the nose.  Oaky, woody, maybe some copper.  Earthy, more vinous and grapey than in the nose.  Big tannins again, going towards the grape end of the wine spectrum.  Perhaps a bit of a chalky taste even, though it might be psychosomatic.  The lactobacillis character is a little more subtle.

Both exact same murky mahogany brown color with moderate beige head. As opposed to RR Supplication or Rodenbach Grand Cru, the aroma was more musty and less sweet tart vinegary but not bad. The taste me was tart with some musty horseblanket and a liitle alcohol which is hidden in the Supplication and the Grand Cru. The problem was it was downright thin with any flavor quickly dissipating into the alcohol taste. It seemed more like a Sour Brown ale like New Glarus Enigma or Liefmans Goudeband than a Flemish sour Red.  That being said both the Enigma and Liefmans are better.

3409,"2007-01-18",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2007 Pours a deep glowing red with a brown murky mist about it. Fizzy bubbles form a giant head of pink, tan and cream colored hues. Lacing is thin fading away at a good clip. Aroma is very potent with notes of wine barrels and some vanilla tinged new oak, tart cherries, a little bit of farm fresh grassiness. Orange zest and cider apples make a brief appearance. Flavor is bold and awe inspiring. Nuances of expensive Bordeaux are crushed to oblivion by massive sour cherries and a barrage of oak barrel spiciness. Vanilla and creme brulee infused with cognac follow. On the back end feather soft carbonation leaves a tingling acidity on the tongue, just a beautiful climax to a near overwhelming sip of Italian nectar. As far as complexity goes, this holds high ranks with the likes of Mouton Rothschild and small village Junmai Dai-Ginjo. Palate is embracing and riveting altogether, with tartness, suppleness and radiating flavor all forming one of the most drinkable and refreshing beverages ever to pass these lips. Finishes strong and sweet/sour, but never too cloying or dry. This is certainly more well priced and accesible than the aforementioned rare wine or sake will ever be. For that, and astonishing flavor from Italy, a nation never included on a list of top beer producing countries, I commend Panil. Awesome drink, certainly the best Flemish style sour produced. Really takes Rodenbach to the mat, in the first round. Splendid. A masterpiece.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Pours a hazy, very nice dark plum color, with a small head that fades away immediately. Theres a small ring that leaves behind a minimal lace. If it wasnt for the color of this, it wouldnt be that much to look at. On the second pour, which was a lot more aggressive, I was able to get a quarter inch head that disappeared just as quickly.

Smell; sour apples, tart cherries, oak and mildly alcoholic. Some spices are present, such as cinnamon and pepper.

Taste; as with the aroma lots of sour apples and tart cherries. The oak barrel flavor is very good, and theres a definite acidic quality. Theres a touch of vinegar that kind of sits in the background, and this finishes with some mild spices and just a touch nutty. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with very little carbonation. As far as drinkability goes, I dont think that Ive ever come cross a beer as drinkable as this one.

Some sesame and orangey zest, a bit like asian sweetbread.  The brilliant scent is followed by a wooded flavor like something ciphoned from an ancient, resilient alpine tree.  Sour, bright and proud.  Tastes of lime, a touch of bitter chocolate, vinegar, and some of that cognac barrel in the finish.  Wonderful, unique mouthfeel is deliberately both tart and dry.

3409,"2006-11-01",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 28, 2009 bottle. Pours a very dark, cloudy mahogany with no head at all. The carbonation is sparse and slow. Aroma is nice on this: pleasant level of distinct lactic sourness, mild hints of ripe cherries, a bit of oak, and a subtle boquet of vinous notes. Given the description on the bottle (which I think conveys a very good attitude) I was expecting something harshly sour and overly dry, but this isnt quite to that level. The beer is actually very tasteful, Ive had a lambic or two that are far more sour than this, but is that necessarily a good thing? Thats certainly up to the drinker. What really impresses me is the way all the flavors meld together in such a flawless and unique fashion. The oaken notes are subdued, a tiny hint of biscuits can be detected, and stronger floral notes create an excellent backdrop for the sour, clothy taste. The finish is bit reminiscent of malt vinegar. Yeah, its certainly dry, but nothing that leaves me parched.  My non-beer enthusiast roommate with fairly convential tastes even liked it. Good stuff.

Bottle from Hop City. Bottle 408,  batch 10, reserva 2008. Pours brown with a decent head. The aroma is very sour with vinegar but not obnoxious. Light cherry hints are here with stronger oak. This is a delightful beer with clean balsamic vinegar, tart black cherries, muscadine, and strong oak notes. A vanilla sweetness is present, almost reminds me of bourbon, but the most prominent qualities are that of tasty, wild, sourness.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

The sour cherries and oak are the strongest flavors--lots of acidity--and actually follows the aroma quite nicely--cant say as I notice any sweetness at any point though.  Mildly bitter dry finish.  The alcohol is there if I dig deep enough.  I dont think there could be any less carbonation without it being flat--medium-full bodied and smooth.

3409,"2006-10-18",3.8,"750 ml bottle, Map Room, Chicago.  Looks good, like its supposed to (medium brown transluscent with mauve highlights, fluffy foam head with some big bubbles).  Smells great: the acid and the wild yeast carry the day, with some pepper.  Feels a bit weak in the mouth, could have more body or expansiveness of flavor.  Tastes nicely sour, not as tart as La Folie or a geuze, more of the soft sour of Rodenbach.  Unlike Rodenbach, it doesnt have a dominant fruit character to carry the rest of the flavor; theres a bit of plumishness and grape, maybe a bit of cherry, but the overall profile is much more earthy.  This is especially true once the wood kicks in, which is the best feature of the flavor, an oak/toothpick touch that complements the sourness nicely.  These opposing qualities linger in the finish, but not long enough.  Very enjoyable; Id say its almost the best ""session"" Flemish Sour I can imagine, if there can be such a thing.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

This beer is a far cry from the standard (mostly pilsner) beers brewed in Italy. It is a real Flanders-style sour red ale similar to, but perhaps better than Liefmans Goudenband and Rodenbach.

3409,"2006-08-10",4.3,"This wins hands down as one of the most amazing smelling beers of all times. In addition to a sour/funky/woody tone, an initial impression of sour cherries, theres this huge blast of flowers, primarily rose, but perhaps also jasmine, opium, and lavender - and/or honey produced from any of these flowers. Flavor sharp up front, with a burnt astringency, followed quickly by a nice lactic bite. Despite a hint of sweetness up front, the beer finishes very dry, with an almost chalky finish. Slightly vinous, like a dry red wine. I think some of the finishing bite is acetic. Generally light bodied, but certainly not watery. The mouthfeel is curious, soft from the light carbonation and smooth malting, but hard from the acidity.

There is a lot of apple and other tart fruit flavors in the taste, along with more complimentary oak. A fabulous beer.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

3409,"2006-07-03",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2008 In short: A world-class Flemish-Sour (some 2005 and 2006 bottles) or an average Flemish Sour (some 2005 and 2006 bottles)
How: Many bottles (2005 and 2006) at different tasting sessions.
Important Note: THIS IS A VERY VARIABLE BEER.  Some bottles are simply amazing and some bottles from the same batch are just good.  In Nov 2007 we had an amazing 2005 bottle at a tasting at Rastacoueres.  The week after I had a truly excellent 2006 bottle at my brothers place.  Two weeks later we had a 2005 bottle and a 2006 bottle at our sour beer tasting at MartinT and both bottles were disappointing.  Talk about variable.  The only good bottles have a thinner body, less oak presence, less sour taste and can even get quite vinous.  Being a positive person this rating is for an excellent bottle.  
The look: Cloudy purple body with a medium beige head
In long: I can smell the oak barrel.  Melted cherry pie meets chocolate meets fruity red wine.  Tickling spicy sensation.  The strong sourness is really oak-sour, not very cherry-sour.  The beer is not very sweet and thats a good thing. Long dry finish, spicy and sour sensation.  One of my favourite Flemish Sour so far.  To me the best 2005 bottles have been better than the best 2006 bottles.  To know the year look at the little label on the neck of the bottle.  The 2005 batch have a cleverly encrypted code that you that reads Bottled in 2005.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The color alone says it all. The aroma was of unripened cherries and vinegar. The frothy head added a nice creamyness to this sour treat.

3409,"2006-06-11",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2009 Bottled in 2005. Poured a pretty burgundy color with sedimentation, but not a lot of thickness. The head was almost non-existent, much like a lambic. The aroma was incredible, cherries and light vinegar jumped out of the bottle. The glass revealed additional notes of cheesey lambic-ness, light lemon type tartness, and the wild bacteria of a lambic. Funky barnyard aromas also present. The flavor was great, a cross between a light lambic (not overly tart, though) with all of the above aromas and funk. Some vanilla came out as it warmed, as did the woody oak notes. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing, not nearly as thick as the Duchesse, much like a good lambic. Carbonation was very low. Finish somewhat dry. A very enjoyable and refreshing beer. Re-rate, bottle 515 of 07, as beer number nine in a killer July 09 Super Secret Sour State Line Tasting (SSSSLT) featuring (first to last by my counts): Supplication, Consecration, La Folie, Dissident, Cuvee de Castleton, Red Poppy, Lambic de Hill, Festina Lente, Panil. Musty sweet oak and red malts, cherries, light lemons. Not super distinguished after running all these sours with quite amazing distinguishability. Oak and musty cellar, some wheat under it all. Something candy-like in the finish, especially at warmer temperatures. Nice, but uninspiring. Thanks, Robert, though, for sharing. A great evening.","","User37895"

Finishes like a warm Chianti, very dry, quite pleasant.  Im just wondering why this has almost no carbonation?  It seems some bubbles would have made the sourness much more enjoyable.

3409,"2006-05-29",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2006 The foreboding nearly purple hue of Panil Barriquée glinted a rusty red in my trappist glass, a somewhat haunting presage that the thin beige film sitting above could not alleviate. On the nose, however, a far more vibrant and stimulating ambience emerge. The opulent aroma of dark caramel fuses with the succulent grape juice, vanilla, sour cherries and apple fragrances. As ostentatious as every Italian I have known, this Flemish Sour evolves an equally pugnacious character on the tongue. Grapefruit, lemon, cherries, berries, and apple juice all lend to the profuse acerbity and bitterness that obliterates on the first sip, and persists until the very last. The palate lacks a balancing sweetness that might assuage some of the puckering without erasing the subtle complexity. Sourness is not unpleasant and is a quality I do enjoy, but the Barriquée in my opinion demands a little more aging before the sharp flavors becomes more rounded and enjoyable. Vedremo, as they say...","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"
3409,"2006-05-27",3.3,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2007 The ebullient Italian way of life has a distinct way of taking the mundane and making it festive.  Take the Italian dinner, for example, whose table is criss-crossed with mercurial debate, love songs and even a handful of food or two.  Or the zest and pep the Italians demonstrate in war; in WWI the first battle of Isonzo ended in utter defeat, but the vivacious Italians repeated the very same push four more times all with disastrous results, demonstrating a non-chalance rarely seen outside the Mediterranean.  Until only recently Italians, partly out of apathy and partly out of inability, retained in power a loud-mouthed, outspoken and candid politician as President who brought a much needed vigor to an otherwise stuffy European political arena (and along with it some rude, offensive and hilarious remarks).  This same exuberance is expressed in Italian beer, so far as Flemish Sour Ales are concerned.  My own opinion stems from the exemplary Panil Barriquée.  Its a speciously straight forward beer, packing all the anticipatory vinegar sourness while retaining a few surprising qualities that are only discovered with a little breathing and a little warmth.  The murky, red color of the Panil, familiar to sommeliers everywhere, has a small trace of oakish brown, perhaps to remind drinkers of the intense aging involved in the brewing process.  The head is a delicate, tan fringe that quickly fizzles away in the heat of its own pour.  From the ale to my untrained olfactory comes a barrage of the sour vinegar smell, with an aggressively bullied puff of sour cherries, red wine and a ubiquitous oak.  Alas, this is where the pleasures of this finely crafted beer come to an end.  Each sip brought a laceration I have never known in any other Flemish Sour Ale.  A great crimson wave washed over my tongue and pricked each one of my taste buds like a corrosive red tide.  The delicate flavors I knew were there could not be found.  I blame my own inexperience, but I did not think it would be so difficult to extricate the sweeter and deeper flavors that the Panil promised.  Maybe its an overexertion on the beers part; maybe Im unfit to handle the Panil, or maybe Im just ill suited for the garrulous Italian attitude that fills the bottle.  Whatever the ill may be, Im mournful  not upset  that this fine Flemish Sour Ale is beyond my capabilities.  Im all too happy to see it enjoyed by those with more refined tastes, where I can acknowledge that there is a deeper concoction of beer in their glass than Ill ever know, in the same way that there is a deeper appreciation in the Italian lifestyle than I can ever understand.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

3409,"2006-05-26",4.2,"Consumed at Monks Cafe, Philadelphia. This oud bruin style beer reall captured my attention with its combination of light effervescence and complex flavors of cherries, oak, pinot noir, and cider. The Belgians should start to worry that such good beers are  being brewed outside of Flanders. Maybe not as aggressive as New Belgium La Folie, but the perfect appetizer, opening the taste buds to the possibilities of good raw-milk cheese, sausage, and other rich fatty starters.

Surprisingly, it starts with a fleeting caramel sweetness which quickly gives way to great tartness.

3409,"2006-02-09",4.4,"750 mL bottle, 2005 vintage.  Pours a bright ruby red with a creamy off-white head that fades to nothing within a minute.  Moderate visible carbonation and lots of fine sediment in the bottle.  Lightly sour aroma with a marriage of fruity essences, especially sour cherry,  and a barrel aged oakiness.  Dry and dusty with a little hint of Brett.  Flavor has just the right amount of sourness and acidity for me.  Very vinous and multi-faceted.  Lots of sour cherry, cherry pits, and plums.  Finish is crisp and very refreshing.  Rather surprised to see that this is 8% ABV as I have a hard time even picking up the alcohol.  Fairly light bodied and thin with low but lively carbonation that dances across the tongue and refreshes the palate for each consecutive sip.  A really great beer in my book.  Refreshing, with enough complexity to make it worthy of a two hour session from one bottle.  Each sip just encouraged another and another till the end.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
3409,"2006-02-05",3.9,"Aroma is vinegar, sour cherries and tart fruits. Reddish brown in color with thumb thick tan head. Fore is quite sour and musty and is followed quickly by tart cherries and unripe apple, strong notes of those baby corns, used in Oriental cooking, stewed in cooking wine. Wood notes pop out in the middle along with musty barnyard notes. Finish is sour and dry and leaves the tongue feeling cleansed. I personally feel this would have benefited by a little more sweetness beneath the sour notes as it hints at it and that promise is enticing, but undelivered.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

This beer is outstanding in every way.  One of the best aromas I have ever found in a beer.  It is sour, but below that is yeast and lambic-like barnyard as well as sweet fruit.  The flavor has sweet and sour elements.  The sweet is very fruit, which Flemish sours can be, but rather than stopping there it has sourness as well.

Dark cherries and generic fruit. Flavour starts out slightly sour but it comes in waves over varying levels of fruit notes. Sourness is a strong characteristic rather than the sole over riding flavour. Finish is quite tart at the back of the tongue. Sweet malt hiding deep down. Fluctuations of fruit and tangy woood. Lingering sour tingle on the tonuge. Quenching like lemonade on a hot day. Average palate.

Pours w/ some fizz & a slight brownish head that is blotchy...deep zinfandel-type red color to the beer.  Heck of an aroma!  Oak, nougat, mustiness, chocolate & coconut (why is this sounding like a candy bar?)  Evolves into earthy berries (elderberries, maybe a couple cherries) & leather.  Quite complex & wonderful.  I guess I should drink it though.  Light bodied & tart.  Earth, leather, oak and a pronounced tartness reminiscent of raspberries & strawberries in its acidity.  The flavor has very little trace of the candy bar save a touch of chocolate.  The oak is not overdone, just present & pronounced...refined.  Carbonation is very light, but it does add a bit of a spark to the beer...vinuous in its drinking...this beer should be served like a quality red wine & enjoyed the same way...Room temp(my room temp today is 64*F), sipping slowly.  It seems that it opens up as it breathes, becoming a bit beefier in body perhaps & the acidity becomes better integrated.  A great beer to spend some time w/ on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Ive gone through 6 bottles of this in the last 30 days...every time I enjoy it a bit more.

Taste is also sour, but milder and more balanced than some Flemish sours - a smooth, funky blend of red wine vinegar and yeasty tart fruit juices.

There is a great deal of sourness in the flavor.  It is almost mouthpuckering at first drink especially when combined with the additional tannic dryness from the wood that almost coats the palate.

3409,"2005-11-04",4.5,"Thanks to hopdog for his one.  Pours a deep red almost brown with a tan lasting head.  Aromas of tarte cherries, fine wine, vinegar, rasberries, and oak are well established and blended in near perfect unison.  Taste is tarte and nutty with vinegar, cherries, a hint of oakiness, and some very nice bitter grape elements.  Mouthfeel is spectacular with the tarte astringency remaining behind for what seems like an eternity.  Superb finish that can be best described as running through an Italian vineyard when the grapes are being harvested on a humid sunny day.  Fantastic!","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
3409,"2005-11-02",4.5,"Bottled in 2005, 750 mL.  Beautiful hazy deep ruby pour with a very nice initial layer of creamy caramel/beige head.  Intricate lacing going down.  Nose was wonderfully complex and intriguing... sour cherries, iron, lemon zest, apples, oak, balsamic vinegar, earth, and much more that I am just not able to put a finger on.  Tingly vinous notes grace the lips on entry... followed by some kind of magical cherry/lemon fruit, that just pummelled the taste buds with sour and tart sensations.  And when you thought that this brew couldnt pack any more depth and character into the flavor... come the top shelf malt vinegar, oak barrels, and some tangy metallic notes.  Finish is tart cherries soaked in vinegar with a lemon twist... long-lasting and lip-smacking good.  Fairly high carbonation makes the flavors spark very well, and this left an ideal vinous dryness across the palate.  This was just tremendous in all regards.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3409,"2005-11-01",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2010 2005 vintage:
The Lure:Royal sweet grapes trickle onto chocolate truffles. Vinous dryness welcomes the obvious tartness. Blueberries are even evoked in the wooden wisdom.

The Festivities:Handsome grape fruitiness, clothed in cherries, get sagaciously covered by a tart lemon curtain. This tartness doesnt last too long, and is thus never overwhelming, even though it can be quite intense in the first half. Yeasty softness benefits from the sweet chocolate within, as alcohol warmth sticks to the wooden barrel allusions. Red wine sovereignty hugs the tartness perfectly, this is of the utmost class. Easier drinking than La Folie, though evidently not for the initiate, a little thinner too, though La Folie is sooo sensual, and all in all leagues in front of the recent Rodenbach Grand Cru. What a stunning beverage fit for kings and queens.

Transcendence:Respectfully walking the infinite halls of a glorious castle, in awe. 4.2/5

2006 vintage:
The nose is a little sweeter (brown sugar and chocolate malt notes), with lots of barnyard and the flavor is really not as fruity. The flavor profile is rather muddled; this is still good but elegance has disappeared. This is a rough, flavorful Sour Ale. 3.5/5","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

Pour was murky muddy brown, looked like pond water really.    Nose is acidic, with a nice fruity tang, and that barnyardiness? if I can use that word.  Flavor is alot less sour than the LaFolie, but still on the sour side.  Big cherry flavor tagging alongside the mild alcohol  kick and oak.

3409,"2005-10-30",4.3,"750 mL bottle, 2005 bottling, Rochefort glass.  Deep brown-ruby hue with fair clarity, visible carbonation, and a moderate, creamy, light tan head with a few larger bubbles.  Leaves a fine sheet of foam over the beer as it disapates.  Lush and sour fruits abound at first whiff: prunes, plums, figs, red grapes, dark cherries.  A more earthy date and almond note comes to fruition.  Dark, unsweetened bakers chocolate tempts.  Oaky and vinous aromas invite.  Rich alcohol aroma like that of a smooth brandy, which I will assume to be the congac.  A delicate floral note rests in the background.  A mild Brett-like presence along with a doughy yeast aroma.  Moist pipe tobacco.  Perhaps a hint of olive oil.  Vinegar aromas is along the lines of balsamic, though fairly withheld for a Flemish Sour.  An amazing olfactory experience - though I could bear to have it ever so slightly more aromatic.  Up front, a delicious blend of those sour fruits and sweet honey on bread - elegant acidity keeps everything in check.  Mid-palate, chocolate flavors take hold, full gusto.  Wood and tobacco notes creep in as well.  More sourness, bitter fruit skins, and red grapes close out the taste.  An aftertaste of sour cherries, tobacco, oak, and light chocolate is left behind.  Its so hard to say, but for as good as this tastes, theres a certain ""roundness"" missing from the flavor.  Something about not being able to tell where one sip ends and another begins.  Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation.  A /touch/ to dry in my opinion - it negatively affects my ability to fully taste and enjoy each subsequent sip.  But hey, damned good.  Tasted in memory of Robert (dortmunder). You will be missed.   May there be great beer in whatever the afterlife holds.  Prost.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Argo0s point of lemon here is well-taken; there is an acidic quality that hits the front palate like a lambic, just without the jaw-dropping edge, and it isnt especially sweet.  The moderate palate/body can be forgiven, since the thinness is off-set by the sourness.

Distinctions and characteristics  aromatically in Flemish Sours are always hard to pinpoint, but this particular one, from Italy, is very vibrant.  Unbelievable balance of lactic and acedic acid, fruit, wood, sourness, along with a light coconut character, which I just love in beers.

Pours crisp and clean dark nut (hazel) brown with ruby highlights as you turn it in the light and a few tiny tightly packed bubbles clinging to the glass.  A light brown foamy head sits atop the sour goodness and exhibits a creamy tiny bubbled lined lacing that lazily falls back to its perch on the brew.  Lightly musty aged oak shortly greets your nose but is quickly replaced by tart cherry/berry malted aromas with faint caramel notes.  As soon as the tart acidic sour cherry mouthful hits your tongue, the saliva glands kick into high gear.  Nice tartness that is enough to overpower the alcohol content which remains unnoticeable throughout the bottle.  The flavor ends moderately acidic with musty aged oak notes and of course, tart cherry.  Medium bodied, almost full bodied, palate with an excellent balanced mouthfeel that is somewhat dry except for the saliva kicked up because of the tartness.  Excellent brew to accompany an acidic Italian dish, to replace the traditional red wine.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"

From afar the noses has a note of balsamic like vinegar.  As I go in for a deeper draught of the aroma I get a funky, musty character that reminds me of old, musty cellars, and wet, slightly moldy blankets.  There is also notes of sour cherry with hints of raisins, prunes and figs as well.  The dominant sense that I get from the aroma is that of a fruity vinegar, it is not hard or so funky like many Lambics, just nicely so.

The beer is quite full bodied as it first hits my mouth, it sticks to and coats my mouth, yet is not really sweet (nothing like the sweetness of a Rodenbach Grand Cru).  The beer has a gripping tannic astringency as well that helps to accentuate the mouth coating sensation.  Wow the body on this is almost thick and chewy, more something I would expect to find in an Imperial Stout.  The beer is definitely sour with acetic acid being the dominant form, though just barely as there is definitely lactic acid here as well.  It is a really nice mix of sourness for this type of beer.  The flavors remind me of (or evoke thoughts of) cherry pits, balsamic vinegar, chewy toffee, dusty cobwebs, tobacco and tannic oak.

What an absolutely exquisite brew, this has been done incredibly well.  I was half expecting this to not live up to the hype, but I am thoroughly enjoying this beer and absolutely wishing that I had a lot more of it.  All of the flavors in this beer are in such an harmonious balance, each flavor melds with and into the others making a complex satisfying whole.  This beer combines a great sourness with a bit of earthy funkiness and lots of chewy malt notes all together to form a splendid tipple.

Intense souring oranges and black cherries, sweetened with some currant currents.  Titters on the palate, souring and then sweetening.

Very vinous with a broad arrange of fruit touched, going from the berries to the grapes and pineapple. Incredible sweet and tart interplays transform your mouth into a carry-on euphoria state. Candyish at first, but quickly turning into a huge tart bite, were talking La Folie tart and maybe more. Huge lactic and acetic character, sharp balanced wood flavors, delicate cherry find their way, fleshy, still fresh.

Beautifully integrated earthy husk whiff. Lush, palate filling carbonation. Quite dense. Sharply sour cherry-flavored explosion with secondary notes of shoe polish and strident medicine. Zingy, irony, and well rounded. Sassy brett pairs up with the pristinely attenuated body to prolong the tartness. Lurking, complementary mineral harshness and firm, but dainty, cedar. Finespun, understated oak-derived tannins mesh effortlessly with the brett laced briskness whilst brightly tart sour cherries continue to ride an earthy husk and clingy medicinal wave. Light candied malt sweetness enhances the acidity. Finishes moistly full, but equally dry with a low-toned woody graze amid invigorating aniseed and cedar exhales, as earthy husks deflect the ensuing leather and fully sustained acetic-tinged tartness. Absolutely stunning. If the aroma, alone, doesnt inspire you, nothing will. Note: Although the malt doesnt really thrive until it warms up, the body does become less dense and the acidity declines as it warms, so I recommend drinking this heavily chilled.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3409,"2005-07-20",4.4,"Big thanks to jimmack04 for the bottle via our recent trade. <br/ ><br/ >It is funny when you think about it; I read a web site on the internet(s) that is all about beer. And on this site there are a multitude of people that will gladly send you a bottle of something that you yearn to try in exchange for a bottle of something that they in turn yearn to try. My most recent hankering was for this strange beer from Italy. A Sour Flanders style ale from Italy?!? Seriously?!!!? Yes indeed! My favorite style, if forced to pick one, waffles from Barley Wine to Gueuze to Flemish Sour and back again. It is mainly a seasonal affair. Well it looks as if it is time to iterate from position 2 to 3 (or 1 to 2 if you are a programmer geek). <br/ > This beer looks so damn fine in the glass. Murky brown red with one of the finest heads I have seen. It starts out quite large then whittles down to a small light tan sheet that lasts forever. The lacing is so lovely. The aroma is nice but neither huge nor terribly complex. Vinegar, cherries, light sourness, and some spicy yeast. Onto the flavor, wow this is where things really pick up. For the complexity that is lacking in the aroma the flavor makes up for it in spades: a huge explosion of tart cherry, balsamic vinegar, wood, tobacco, even some cocoa. The sourness is perfect and it is one of the most refreshing beers I have had. Lovely palate: medium textured, mostly attenuated but some sweetness to keep things moving. <br/ >The comparisons to La Foile or Rodenbach are inevitable. For me La Foile is one of the best beers I have ever had. The Rodenbach Grand Cru is good but killing yeast outside of ones gullet is a sin. This one deserves to be in that company but falls a tad short of the La Foile, especially in the aroma. I am just not picking up the complexities that others have mentioned. <br/ > Postscript: I find it encouraging that some of the best beers of this style in the world are brewed in the US and Italy. Maybe we will start seeing more examples. Fingers crossed.<br/ > Postscript Postscript: If you do not like sour beer then either: 1) Dont bother with this beer or 2) Open your mind and try it. Lots of people find bitter flavors very offensive but yet learn to love lupulin.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

Is it complex? not in my book, at least not the most complex, but very pleasing and inviting. For me to be five minutes after a pour and still not to have sampled is saying something about the aroma. Very light and smooth on the palate. Mildly toasted sweet malt meet the tip of the tongue and swept back with mild bitter cherries, light melon and blackberries.

Nose is fruity, note of cherry kernel, bitter chocolate, vinous, wet wood, light lactic-cheese aroma.
Taste is sour-dry, vinous, very easy to drink, with a lot of sour and tannins that clean palate. The ideal beer for meat dishes. Light metallic aftertaste, medium body.","Coltura, ITALY","Aldrighetti"
3409,"2003-10-24",4.3,"red brown, strong head,woody vinious smoky aroma, sour brett balances well with a fruity chocolate malt sweetness no hop aroma, slightly chalky aftertaste.
Very lively. I tried the first one on the balcony of my hotel in italy with no refridgeration - lost most of it over the head of an unsuspecting german tourist.","arlington, Virginia, USA","theakston"
3409,"2003-02-26",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 17, 2005 Colour: dark brown with clearly a reddish shine. The head is brownish-pinkish. The nose is old oak wood, woodstainer, cherrycake and chocolate. Taste gives a hint of diacetyl, a good trace of bitter chocolate, lots of tannines. Retronasal bitter taste that has a metallic tang to it and quite phenolic. Mouthfeel is full-bodied. Rather some fusel alcohols than ethanol, unless after a very long time, some brandy-ish hint comes up. After a certain time, there is also a new flavour, reminding of noga.
This is one of the most complex beers Ive ever tasted. The nose is phenomenal. Points lost are on ""going too far"", as the beer has been acting as a chemical extractor of all what was in the wood. Were this beer refermented with a fruit as cherries, it would have been mind-blowing.
