3066,"2016-08-08",4.4,"Flaska från SB. Limited release nr 6. Denna flaska från 2014, dessförinnan lagrad på Niepoort-fat i 24 månader. Djup mahogny-mörkbrun med ett beiget, fingerhögt skum som snabbt lägger sig. Stor, fyllig doft med varma och kryddiga inslag av portvin och madeira. Mycket inlagda körsbär och nötiga toner. Inte superstor kropp som barley wines i denna klassen kan vara, men alldeles lagom för att bära upp smakbilden. Smakmässigt inleds det med nötiga kolatoner och stor sötma som sakta övergår i mer inlagda körsbär och torkade tranbär. Portvinstonerna finns där redan i början men tilltar något en bit in. Fatlagringen har verkligen gjort sig på den här ölen, och det är häftigt att se hur väl det satt sig både i smak och lukt. Det ligger liksom inte på ytan, utan har trängt djupt in i smakbilden och är ruskigt välintegrerad med resten av ölen. Smakbilden i stort är väl sammanhållen med subtila övergångar och överlag oerhört jämn och välintegrerad. I avslutningen nästan lite brända toner från rostade mandlar. Alkoholen värmer och tar precis rätt plats. Nästan 160 spänn flaskan - helt klart värt varenda slant. Nästan så jag ville slänga iväg en beställning på en till flaska på direkten...","Örebro, SWEDEN","Samuel214"

3066,"2011-06-17",3.9,"Thanks to TurdFurgison for sharing this gem at our Bates-motel-like abode up in Vermont during the Hill Farmstead festivities. Served in a SAVOR snifter.

Pours a murky muddy brown with a very small cap to start out, which dissipated quickly and turned into a collar. The nose brought loads of port along with some caramel. Lots of malt sweetness and a good deal of port, dark fruits, and pit fruits. Slight booze there as well. The flavor didnt contain quite as much of the port and fruit character and was more of the sweet caramel malt. Quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel was really nice -- silky smooth with just a slight bit of booze and nice port-like finish. Really delicious all around. Thanks to Eric for the chance to try this one.

3066,"2011-05-03",4.1,"375ml bottle, packaged August 2009 and aged about 1.5 years in the bottle.  The pour yields a dark and hazy plummy brown body.  A small gathering of khaki foam circles the surface, lasting a good while, but leaving just minimal spotting behind.  Sheeting is dense and sudsy.  The aroma is insanely rich and inviting, showing a varied blend of dark fruits, including sweet figs, dates, and raisins, as well as more acidic plums, prunes, and black cherries.  Browned caramel and toffee lurk beneath, velvety, smooth, and only slightly alcoholic.  Toasted nuts lend further depth.  The barrel suggests of velvety vanilla and currants, .  Flavors follow suit, sweet and fruity from start to finish, loaded with dried and concentrated red raisin, plum, cherry, and seemingly every other conceivable dark fruit varietal.  Caramel and brown sugar are intertwined, as is scorched honey and soft chocolate, yet they all manage to grant the fruit the starring role.  The palate is lush and smooth, showing a very slight (and welcomed) oxidation and appropriately soft carbonation.  Though sugary, the warming alcohol somehow manages to lighten things a bit, making it dangerously drinkable.  I must say that the barrel application is perfect for the base beer.  It destroys the bourbon barrel version.  Great beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

3066,"2010-07-28",4.7,"(on bottle) This might be one of the best BWs I´ve  had. Very complex and smooth, the mix of heavy beer and the port is present in such a fine aroma; I could snif the whole bottle dry, did I not have such a weak personality. Tart woody notes, soft with vanilla, wet leather, and fresh figs, combined with he rich maly and robust alcohol is great. Just a slight carbonation to swrl all the goodiness up. Draw a thick curtain of lacing on the glass, the taste is also hols liqouríce, some dried fruits; over al, a more heavy profile, wich the alcoholwarmth really compliments beautifully. Long and warm finish, some tobaco and more leather/port It´s simply a gem of a beer.","DENMARK","JensenTaster"

Aroma is oxidized already, fairly woody and earthy with some slight sweet wine notes, cognac, soy and meaty oxidation- almost pork or pig like- ham, some bacon in there as well- some sugary sweetness, and slight maple sweetness/oxidation with figs, and other dried sweet fruits.  Flavor is more sweetness, maple, honey, soy, ox saltiness, meat, raisin, fig, deep toasted and stewed malts, caramel, toffee, molasses, plums, brown sugar, soy and slight papery oxidation.  THe barrel aging really sped up the aging of this beer such that it seemed over 10 years old already.  Not bad.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

3066,"2010-03-16",2.9,"Bottle. Dark brown with small brown head, looking quite flat.
Aroma first off all sweet, alcoholic, prunes and a little oxidised, not much port. Taste way too sweet, cloying, strong alcoholic and some very weak port notes. Finish weak port notes but most of all cloying sweet. I still haven´t tasted a barrel aged beer that convinced me that barrel ageing add anything positive to a beer. It takes away the freshness and and adds a lot of sugar and cloying sweetness.","Nibe, DENMARK","rane"

Deep burgundy red with a small tanned head that leaves minimal lacings. 

The smell is intense and deep with heavy malt aromas and powerful notes of vinous fruit, oak barrel and toffee. Hints of cookie dough and warming alcohol. Lovely aroma. 

The taste his almost even more intense. The flavor is sweet and malty with rich caramel notes, toffee and powdered chocolate. Some toasty notes. Lovely port barrel character and vinous fruity notes (ripe plums, grapes). Some spicy and tannic bitterness. The finish packs a bit of punch  from the alcohol and is nicely warming with pleasant oak flavors, spices and malts.

Aroma is slightly sweet, vinous and very complex with roasted malts, port wine, light oak, nuts and dark fruit.  Flavor was malty to begin with plenty of roasted malts, caramel, dark fruits, woody oak and port wine... again, lots going on here.  As the beer warmed, it reminded me of an excellent tawny port.
