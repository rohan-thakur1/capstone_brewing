3297,"2016-04-25",3.7,"Jaune pâle avec une moyenne robe blanche et du rétention excellent. Larôme des céréales avec un peu dhoublon floral. En bouche les céréales sont très bien équilibré avec lhoublon, cest très fraîche et léger, avec très peu de sucre résiduel. Très bien fait.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","vadie"

3297,"2015-07-06",3.5,"650ml bottle pours a slightly hazy straw color with a massive white head that retains well and reveals some decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is pepper and grains with some hints of apple and grass. Taste is a grassy hop bitterness with a peppery spiciness and a light fruity and malty sweetness. Light bodied with generous carbonation that fancies the palate. Overall, this is a fantastic kellerbier, definitely one of the best brews I have had in this style.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
3297,"2015-06-07",4.2,"Amazing foamy white soapy head atop a nicely carbonated gold body. Nose of grass and corn malt. Very tasty... This is what a hopped pils should taste like. Solid bitterness through the front intertwined with a mild canned corn finish. Wonderful wonderful stuff... Ranks up there with Moon Under Water Potts Pils as best in the province.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"

3297,"2014-11-13",3.8,"Bomber. Clear straw yellow, smaller lasting white foam. Aroma of spicy herbal hop and lager malt. Taste is bitter spicy earthy hop forward, slightly floral, biscuity lager malt, no sweetness. Average carbonation, lighter bodied, moderately hopped. Clean and crisp. Well crafted.

3297,"2014-09-06",4.0,"On tap @ Alibi Room. Fairly clear golden straw pour with a white head. Aroma is very floral and spicy. A decent citrus character, which I suppose isnt quite traditional. A bit bready and grassy, too. Flavor has a really good, crisp bitterness. Lots of bread, grass, and floral hops. Slight fruit and citrus character. A little bit of yeast and dough. Pretty good.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3297,"2014-08-24",3.6,"On tap at the Alibi Room, pours a clear pale yellow with a small white head. Aroma brings out lots of corn and grass, with a cereal malt back. Flavour is very refreshing, with very dry biscuity malt, grassy hops, a touch of corn, and a slightly bitter finish. Very well-constructed, with a hoppier than typical flavour profile for a pils. Highly drinkable. Good stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3297,"2014-08-19",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 11, 2017 2017-06-11, bottle from The Gull, North Vancouver, 7-4-7-4-14=36Slight haze, small head. Very nice grass and hay aroma, delicate. The mouthfeel is dry and lean; the malt profile could be better, but there are some grassy notes from the hop, a bit of vegetable bitterness too.Very good, but I had better versions of it.2014-09-19, draught at Alibi Room, Vancouver, 10 oz, 7-4-8-4-16=39More pronounced hay flavor, strong cereals, and apparently stronger bitterness than I remember.2014-08-28, draught at St. Augustines, Vancouver, 14oz, 6-3-7-4-14=34Pouring this beer in a pint shaped glass is a crime. The aroma is seriously killed. The nice, lean and partially crispy malt body is preserved, followed by grassy hopping, strong bitterness, but somehow unexciting. Its really a matter of service.2014-08-22, draught at Alibi Room, Vancouver, 20 oz, 7-4-7-4-14=36Nice pilsner, it shows some grassy hops, but also a hint of vegetables; and the strong final bitterness that I found last time. Good but less impressive than a few days ago.2014-08-18, draught at Six Acres, Vancouver, 12oz+12oz, 8-4-8-3-17=40Hazy blond color with medium sized head. Wonderful aroma of noble hops, dry grass. Dry, with a good, lean malt base, and potent hopping, very grassy, and spicy; well carbonated; at a certain point the bitterness seems even excessive (ding), with hop tannins, but it would be perfect for a hot summer afternoon or to go with any food. As often happens, I prefer the aroma over the flavor, slightly.Very good, if not perfectly balanced. I wish I had access to this in Vancouver any week of the year.It grows on you.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
3297,"2014-08-11",4.3,"Draught at the brewery. Slightly hazy gold with a bubbly head. Fresh and hoppy with light noble spiciness. Full body. Refreshing bitterness, again hop earthiness and spice. Everything is fresh, including the lovely pale malts with a hint of biscuit. Just a slight yeastiness in the finish, some minerals to help the hops along. Perfectly balanced. You could sell this in Franconia. Their best beer yet. Cant stop drinking it. Dont give me any of this ""one-off"" nonsense - when you make a beer as hard to nail as kellerbier this well you have to keep brewing it.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
