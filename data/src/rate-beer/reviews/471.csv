471,"2014-05-18",3.4,"Last live review of the night.
I bought one 22 oz. bottle on my way home from roller hockey tonight.
I poured this into a snifter.
The appearance was a deep dark brown close to a black in color with a half fingers worth of an off-white close to a tan colored head. The lacing is sporadic and kinda all over the place.
The smell has a dark and roasty sort of coffee combined ever so delicately with a meaty sort of aspect running through it. Its dry and subtly combines a good strength of chocolate to roasty character all the way through.
The taste takes the coffee and the chocolate and combines exceptionally well through a dryness pummeling my taste buds harshly. The aftertaste is extremely bitter through the coffee notes and adds a decent yet balanced dry to sweet finish. That aftertaste is not exactly what I had hoped for, but anyways, I shall proceed.
On the palate, it sat about a medium to heavy on the body with not much of any sessionability sort of aspect to it. I sipped this one for the most part.
Overall, hey, this is actually a very nice Foreign/Extra Stout and very worthy of having again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Aroma is roasty and a little burnt with nice coffee and chocolate notes.

Flavor follows through with the nose, maybe with a touche of anise (but its subtle).  The chocolate and coffee are a bit more pronounced, leaving a slightly cappuccino effect for the imbiber.

Body is full, thick, rich, and leaves a wonderful slightly roasted, slightly burnt aftertaste that I really enjoy in a stout.

Definitely recommended.  Ill for sure buy this one again.","Texas, USA","alcaponejunior"

471,"2012-10-01",3.9,"April 18th, 2010 - For all the tripels and wheats out and available in stories, the stout is one of the best beers for the cold, drawn out, bone chilling Seattle days. Theres a demand for the dark stuff when everything else is in grayscale, and Pike is ready to serve it up. The head is a lacy cinnamon brown color, and the dark black body gives off a sweet perfume of cinnamon, coffee, dark chocolate and fresh leather. It smells rugged, maybe even manly. The flavor is delivered on a medium heavy body with a healthy carbonation and excellent balance. Theres a bitter dimension, but its not heavy handed. Like the aroma, the flavor is spicy and rugged, with a sharp alcoholic taste, and a robust strength that lifts the drinker past the malaise of Seattles weather into fine spirits. While Im not a devotee of Pikes other offerings, their stout is always a welcome beer in my glass.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

471,"2011-12-21",3.9,"A very nice deep black stout.  Lacking complex flavor and much of an aroma (But how many beers really have great aromas?  This isnt wine.).  However, much of its lack of complexity it makes up for as an outstanding pure blue color stout.  Its drinkable, a little bitter, dark black, roasted, with moderate alcohol flavor and content.  

Simple on the palate, low on the hops.  Perfect for cold weather or the pool.  The pool might seem weird but it is not too thick, richly flavored, or high alcohol content (ie. can consume copiously) but can enjoy cold and warm (I live in Texas - if you drink outdoors in the summer your beer is cold after 90 seconds).","Dallas, Texas, USA","JimisDose"

Packed with deep toasty malt and bitter bakers chocolate, Pike extra stout is both mild enough to drink a whole bomber, and wicked enough to stand up to a charred steak on the Barbie.

I dont know why it has taken so long to get around to opening this. If I had known how good it was I would have gotten around to my only bottle a long time ago. Even after a year in the cellar it is holding up quite well. Considering the price this is an excellent value for those who can get it on the West Coast.

Aroma / Appearance - The black body was very lazy as it flowed from the bottle into my goblet. With a dense head it played the part of stout as well as any other beer that I have ever run across. Dark chocolate, raisins, anise, and the smell of a thick truffle blend effortlessly into a contemplative and heady experience.

Flavor / Palate - Rich black coffee immediately hits the tongue. Following closely behind is a mouthful of bitter grounds and smoke. The dry finish invites another sip until eventually there is no more. A robust example of the style this affordable release is another gem from Pike and reminds me why I need to get out there again at some point.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

No head, just a light ring. Nose is coffee, cocoa, and an incongruous floral note -- lavender? Flavor is strongly mocha and coffee, almost but not quite burnt; mouthfeel is lighter than I expected given the pour.

Pleasant aroma that paralleled taste of malt, dark chocolates and subtle coffees. Palate was smooth at the front end and, as described in the commercial description, pleasantly bitter and dry on the way down and afterwards. Could perhaps be heavier in body.

On the nose I am getting some roasted malt and a little chocolate. I find it to be pretty boring to be honest.

The flavor is giving me some dark roasted malt, chocolate, hints of coffee. I am picking up a little warmth from the alcohol. It most of the things I like in a good stout but nothing really stands out. It seems to be a little thin for the style.

The flavor was dry, bitter and roasty with notes of licorice, port wine and floral hops and undertones of cocoa and wood. The finish was long iwth licorice, cocoa and floral hops lingering.

471,"2011-03-03",4.1,"22oz bottle from blutt59, thanks Bob! Pours a black body with a finger-width, dense and creamy, dark brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing.

Lots of roasts up front with a good amount of piney hops behind them. Plenty of dark chocolates and char with some thin caramels, coffee, and a light wood.

Light-medium bitterness before leaving a very lengthy aftertaste following a medium-thin, very smooth body and soft, creamy yet somewhat lively, medium-light carbonation. Overall, an excellent stout. Tons of bold roasts and char with a nice piney hop. Lots of dark chocolates offer just a light sweetness, but balance nicely and give this a thinner feeling body that I feel works really well.

471,"2011-02-21",3.7,"650ml bomber, 2009 edition, it is 7% alc.

Pours into my American pint glass with a dark brown/black and only hints of light on the edges when held to light, it is very dark. The head looks nice and is caramally tan and leaves some nice lacing.

It smells roasty, chocolatey, carmally, and fruity. There is a slight hop note to it but is is very faint.

Taste has alot of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. It is dark and roasty, a good example taste-wise for this style. The mouthfeel is ok, a bit watery, then carbonated, but it is true to the British style of doing it.

It is hugely drikable for the abv.

Overall a great beer right here, not my fav style but this makes me enjoy it.

Original review September 12, 2010:
22oz bottle, unknown date.  Pours medium bodied dark brown with a good brown head, leaves some fine intricate lace and holds a faint cap and small ring.  Aroma is all roast and chocolate, quite strong, some semi-sweet and milk chocolate, heavily roasted malts, some smoke, some coffee, a hint of vanilla.  Flavor comes in with a lot of coffee, good roasted malts, chocolate, a bit of dark fruit, lightly sweet with bitterness from the roast to balance, maybe a bit of citrus hops as well.  Smokiness picks up a lot as it warms up.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, medium body, low carbonation, but not heavy like an Imperial Stout.  Very nice, very robust Stout, big aroma and flavor on this one.

Flavor is even better than the aroma - richly of roast fine coffee, unsweet chocolate and molasses, the flavors I like best in a stout. It is only slightly sweet and has a touch of bitterness.

471,"2009-11-18",3.6,"22oz bomber, 7.0% ABV listed.

Pours completely black with only the faintest hint of light penetrating the edges.  Theres a small but thick mocha head that leaves only spotty lacing.

The aroma is nice with equal measures sweetness and roastiness.  The sweetness comes from the dark chocolate mainly and the malts come across heavily roasted with some coffee hints.  There are even some fresh green hops thrown in.

The taste is more of the same with the initial taste containing a kick of the green hops before the heavily roasted black malts take over.  There is some cocoa sweetness on top with a finish that is a mixture of dry roasted malts and green hop bitterness.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and extremely creamy with a dry, roasted finish.

Silky chewy viscous mouthfeel with a lot of roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate, oatmeal, toffee, biscuit, roasted coffee bean and a huge bitter earthy hop flavor with some citrus notes.  This is way hoppier than expected and kind of takes away from the silky maltiness that I liked so much.  The finish is long and dry with some citrus notes but mostly earthy bitter hops dominate.  Well masked ABV and smooth maltiness makes it pretty drinkable but the strong hop presence kind of hurts it in this area.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Its been awhile since Ive had a Pike beer... where will this go? Black beer with a dark brown cap, good consistency, really good lacing with sticky messy lacing and permanent rings. The aroma is damn fine. A bit of sweet and freshness (from the hops for sure - a light citrus), soft chocolate with a bit of bakers bitterness, some roasty stuff from coffee. I like the citrus in here. Nothing here is overpowering. A touch earthy. Man, this is an excellent drinking beer. Very well placed bitterness, creamy chocolate blended with a lesser amount of coffee grinds. I can tell there are citrusy hops (grapefruit) here but they are portioned very well. Maybe a bit too bitter on the finish as it lingers heavily. There might bit a hint of biscuit as well. Smooth with a bit zip, some lingering coffee, long hop finish but its good because it takes nothing away while adding some needed complexity. I may be ignoring the coffee.

Aged it has all the things that make an imperial stout great, red fruit and licorice, and a full oily mouthfeel.  Young its mouthfeel is a little watery, with hops being very evident in both nose and taste, with not a lot of fruit but a bit of chocolate and coffee.  To have this young you would probably say its a stout like any other, but with a years time (at least, id like to drink it after 3) it becomes absolutely freakin amazing.

Bonus from acertain. Pours a dark and gloomy brown-black with wisps of creamy tan head. Aroma is straight from the School of How A Stout Should Smell -- rich, roasty, chocolaty, caramel-y, topped of with vinous alcohol. Flavor is, not surprisingly, rich, roasty, chocolaty, caramel-y, topped off with vinous alcohol, only the dry toasty grain plays an appropriately larger role than in the aroma.

Nose shows some molasses, chocolate, mild coffee, very rich, and then I start to pick up the precursors of the astringency I was to taste. Flavor is rich and roasty upfront but very quickly turns to an overpowering bitter/astringent character. Not sure if it was hops or grain but it was very undesirable. Coffee comes through, thought I may have picked up some acetaledehyde. The body is very full and velvety but very quickly turns to bitterness. Very lasting astringent bitterness.

471,"2008-11-26",3.9,"A solid pour produces a cresting, almost four-finger thick, rich, creamed chocolate brown colored head in my 25cl tulip glass.  The head leaves lots of sticky lacing as it slowly recedes.  The beer is just about perfectly black and doesn’t pass any light no matter how close I hold it up to my desk lamp.  Sharply acidic roast notes mix with a rich cocoa aroma up front.  Other aromatic notes of salty smoked peat, burnt toffee, a rich toasted grain base, a concentrated cocoa note and an almost meaty rich malt driven note that I can’t quite pinpoint (lots of Maillard browning and an umami effect), but it really boosts the richness of the aroma and provides a substantial foil to the up front burnt acidity.

Lightly sweet, but significantly rich, towards the middle the roast malt provides an acidity and dry burnt flavor that almost drowns out the malt sweetness, but in the finish the malt sweetness makes a comeback.  Ultimately this beer finishes dry as a sharp, softly acid, burnt bitter roast character is what ends up lingering on the palate.  Burnt, dark chocolate notes envelope the tongue for a time as the malt sweetness lingers and this beer has a certain velvet-like texture that helps boost the chocolate notes as well.  This really is pretty thick and rich (especially for a beer of 6.6% abv), it is quite chewy, though the burnt, acidic, slightly acrid, roast malt definitely cuts through the richness a fair amount.  Lingering in the finish is also a significant hop bitterness that couples with the roast bitterness.  As the beer warms I begin to notice an almost salty, smoky character to this beer.

Despite being so roast dominated (and by this I mean the sharper, harsher notes), I am really enjoying this beer, there is enough other rich, offsetting / balancing flavors that this beer is just quite enjoyable.  Just a fantastic, rich, stout that isn’t too strong; in fact it is much richer than its alcohol might suggest and this is actually quite nice.

How: Bottle 22oz, age unknown but consumed with a week after receiving it from after4ever.  Thanks a lot Tom.
The look: Black body with a short-lived tan head
In long: Upfront I found a lot of roastiness and quite a bit of chocolate.  Theres a creamy taste/texture, almost lactic, reminding me of chocolate ice cream.  Black liquorice joins in with some dark fruits and a very light roasted coffee beans taste.  Although the taste has very little coffee, the after-taste had a lot of sweetened black-coffee and chocolate cake.  Medium-strong bitterness.  I felt a little warming alcohol presence which is surprising for a below 7% stout.  Although very tasty, almost aggressive, theres something about this beer that makes it refreshing even if these are not the usual refreshing flavours.  I liked it a lot.  The annoying thing is that I couldnt enter my rating from work as usual because I got a Porn Block from the firewall because of the XXX in the name.

471,"2007-12-10",4.0,"12/10/2007:  Pike Stout XXXXX Extra Stout is near black to black.

A large amount of semi-sweet chocolate along with some roasted malt and hints of smoke/char and coffee.

Pours ultra-black with some amber hues at the edges and an interesting two-layered head-- the bottom half was a darker brown, the top half a khaki tan, with a definite line between them. The aroma is coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, and red wine- a more sophisticated nose than I had expected. The flavor is coffee, bitter chocolate, mildly acidic raspberry, and toasted wood at first. It then gets some brown sugar and rum notes, but the roastiness intensifies to keep the sweetness at bay. The finish is somewhat piney, and also a little bit vinous.

Thoroughly opaque black color with a lasting tan head.  Flavor is full of roast and cocoa as well, bittersweet, with a good dosage of fresh, leafy hop flavor, not much in the way of bitterness, though, as the bittering balance in the equation seems to belong solely to the dark, coffeeish, grainy malts.  Good blend.  Piney, very lightly fruity hoppiness, malts are very darkly roasted and sweet, working well in conjunction.  Very full-flavored, makes for an appropriate dessert beer or digestif.

Probably not the night to be drinking a stout with as hot as its been but what the hell? Pike 5x Stout pours the blackest of holes into my snifter. Not one bit of light can sneak through. The body swallows every bit of light that comes into contact with this beer. A 1+ finger brown head forms and slowly fades to a thick cap. Leaves drink lines down the glass after each gulp.

Aroma is like nothing Ive smelled in previous stouts. Theres a solid smokiness in there that reminds me of smoked bacon. May sound strange but it smells damn fine. Mild roasted malts with a solid hop presence on the backend. Mild hazelnut in there as well.

Wow! What a delicious unique stout. That smokey bacon (or is it just campfire and Im hungry) scent is in the flavor as well. The smokiness blankets a mildly roasted malt and hazelnut nuttiness. A hint of milk on the finish with a combination of burnt malt and hop bitterness. Delicious!

Mouthfeel is just how Id like it to be. Medium bodied. Not too heavy.Sluggish carbonation that lets the brew roll along the tongue. Nice bitterness on the swallow.

An incredibly drinkable stout, especially with the robust smokiness. The alcohol level helps the drinkability as well.

Im actually blown away by this brew. Before I ordered the bottle I saw it had good reviews but I didnt expect this. A really wonderful unique stout.

See my Places rating for more on this. 

An essentially opaque brown/black pour with a substantial brown head introduces this well known offering. Beautiful sticky lace clings to the glass indefinitely. The chocolate and coffee aroma is accented by some woody or roasted notes. This is so smooth and creamy that the heavy body isnt easily noticed. Beautiful flavor balance of rich dark malty sweetness and some bitterness from the roasted malts and understated hops. This is really a good beer.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"

471,"2007-07-13",4.1,"Undated bomber. Pours like a thick liquid. Aroma of smoke, roasted malt, yeast, coffee and chocolate. At least. Wholly opaque brown/black color with a tan head that sticks around. Thin to medium mouthfeel; so much for illusion. Moderate carbonation. Really toasted/burnt malts like the Guinness of old. Coffee; dark fruits; not getting chocolate. There is some malt sugar, but it is more dry than otherwise. Strong, near espresso, impression for the finish. Really whacks the mouth. Then a slight toffee sweetness came forth. Very slight. This is relatively humongous in terms of aroma and flavor. If it were an imperial stout, the overall combination might be fatal.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

471,"2006-12-26",4.0,"Draught pints at Redbones, 11/7/06 and 12/10/06Deep, deep raven-black beer is opaque through the middle, but upon settling, and against the light, shows garnet-auburn tints on the edges, with some clarity at the sides.  Creamy, beige/light-tan head sits atop the beer, not very much of it, but quite well-retained, providing moderate lacing.Very interesting bittersweet nose has a cohesive mix of cola, prunes, raisins, brandy, dates, maraschino cherries and moderate roast.  It smells fluffy....with vanilla cream notes lingering long on the finish and medium sweet cherry notes really adding a great strength of aroma.  Not sure whats creating the cherry vanilla-like nose, but its tastefully done.  Some light milk chocolate and very light bakers chocolate give additional balance, while a light, fruity hoppiness emerges with warming.  Probably the responsible party for the cherry notes, and sure enough, some light citrus notes emerge as well, over time.  But aromatic and juicy are the hops, only lightly done and not bitter in the least.  Promising is the aroma.A combination of chewy, almost caramel-molasses-like consistency, well-placed jabs of dry roast and then a softly sweet cherry vanilla flavor certainly pleases.  Very well balanced, though tending somewhat sweet, the initial chocolate-caramel-vanilla flavors evolve in to a vast sea of dark fruits.  Raisins, prunes, dates, cherries...A faint bit of tartness, be it dark malt or lacto induced helps nip the sweetness and the finish ends with a toned-down roastiness, that incorporates more light chocolate and a touch of leafy, juicy hops.  This beer is all about warming.  Though its good cool, the complexities that emerge as it breathes/warms are just plain impressive.  All the interesting, unique flavors of a foreign stout, even something like De Dolles, but with plenty more chocolate, light hops and vanilla creaminess bringing back in to the American realm.  None of the sugary sweetness of a foreign stout and more complexity than your usual oatmeal or standard brewpub stout.  No alcohol noted in aroma or flavor.  Fairly engaging carbonation is low to moderate, fitting the bill aptly.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Minimal sweetness with nice bitterness that seems to come from the almost burnt malt as much as from the hops, alcohol is just slightly noticable. There is a very slightly burnt rubber taste on the very dark, almost burnt roasted malt. The hop flavor is there but not overdone. Dark chocolate and black coffee are in the mix. This stout is a bit monotoned, lacking real complexity but its consistant full body is  a big plus. Looking foreward to enjoying this again.","Coeur dAlene, Idaho, USA","billk"

Aroma is tarry and roasted with heavy black malt dryness with some dark chocolate scuffing.

Taste is bold, rich, and gradually building across a wonderful, medium to heavy roastyness of black malt. Chocolate intercedes into the middle areas, then the fun begins with one fantastic drying length and character. Slight molasses tang sweetens the pot for a stint, notes of burnt/charred edges creep in there while the chocolate gets supurbly darkened, heavy, and dry with a solid smack of bitterness thrown in. A very solid smack! Thats some of the most bitter dark chocolate Ive ever encountered in a stout. Its awesome!

The body of this beer is quite nice. Full, round, roasted and textured as so with a substantial girth of roasty malt all the while maintaining a heavenly smoothness. Its just sweet enough on the underside for most of its length, gliding the roasted stuff along the path to the finish where the dark bitter chcoalte takes over and does its thing.

An excellent drinker as well as being damn tasty. What more could you ask except for more. And at 6% this blows the sessionable competition away as far as other big stouts that taste like this are concerned. Not that I dont miss a little kick like those found in most Impys or Dbls, these Foreign/Export stouts are just too damn tasty and drinkable not to be in the same league as some of those big boys.

Pours a deep black with a nice tan head.The aroma is the expected coffee and roasted grain, with a lovely full nose of black cherry. Flavor is rich - dark chocolate, coffee, cherry, molassas, plum, with a well-balanced but unobtrusive hop finish - and the mouthfeel equally so, full and satisfying and not the least bit watery like some of its competitors. The commercial description alludes to the ""strengh of character of Imperial stout""; this is not an idle claim. An excellent big-beer styling at only 6.2%.

Sampling the 05-06 in Febraury 07, the beer retains a very nice roastiness along with a lactic, almost sour aroma and flavor that is quite enjoyable. 
2006: In bombers this year, at 6.6%. The coffee flavors are really heavy, especially late in the flavor profile, but this is really nice stuff. Its drier than most of the imperial stouts, with a powerful burnt-coffee bitterness in the finish.

Deep coffee roast, huge dark purple raisin, a tinge of acrid and acidic burnt charcoal, juicy black licorice, and even some dried apricot flavors.  Touch of sourness as well, which is where the beer is maybe showing some signs of wear.  Very smooth finish with a fluffy mouthfeel and a lingering hum of a creamy carbonation texture.  Finish is long and quite dry with a woody bourbony flavor entering the equation a little bit.  Just a touch too much of that sourness lingering.  Very, very good stuff.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
471,"2004-09-05",3.9,"(2003-2004) Midnight black with a mid-sized, frothy, well-tanned head. The aroma is all espresso and dark chocolate with just a hint of black cherry and raspberry. The flavor is full of dark chocolate, espresso, ash and everything else burnt. Also a hint of buttermilk. Full-bodied with a creamy and astringent mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Lengthy, burnt, moderately bitter finish. Very, very nice!  Thanks go out to Andre' for the bottle.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

Nice but the harsh bitter trailer puts me off a bit.","Boise, Idaho, USA","IndianaRed"
471,"2004-07-16",4.4,"Had this with KBJAMES. A very good northwest Stout to be sure. Pours as black as you can get, motor oil is often used I think. Head is dark tan. Great lacing. Nose is heavy on roast with deep hop fruitness just behind it. Attack is filled with deep roast flavors (coffee, dark chacolate), and the crisp fruitiness of the hops. The finish is long and gentle, multitudes of subtle roast/yeast/hop flavors dance on the pallete throughout... Excellent beer start to finish.","Washington, USA","cstuartj"

471,"2004-02-28",4.4,"I'm ticked. I just wrote one of my most detailed reviews a few hours ago and then I deleted it. Forgive me for slighting on this review as I'm doing it completely from memory.

Poured about as black as any beer I've seen with a tan head and minimal lacing.

Tastes great and *very* complex. Not as hoppy as most Stouts but not out of balance at all. Coffee, toffee, a bit of citrus as well as some fruits like apricots.

Mouthfeel was good and had a nice subtle mineral moutfeel to it. Drinkability was great as this was one of the better Stouts I've had. I'm kicking myself for not getting a few more of these from Liquid Solutions while I was there. This is well worth seeking out.","Port Orchard, Washington, USA","Gromit"

Release: 2003-2004
Pours as black as the night in the jungles of Borneo with a fluffy toffee colored head of  foam. The nose introduces notes of toffee, raisins, mocha, and cappuccino. The flavor is VERY toasty! Highly kilned chocolate malts, oily French Pressed coffee to no end, a bitter / sweet shock to the palate on the first sip! Rather smoky and chocolaty…. Large suggestions of oak and even some bourbon like submissions. Probably the most black coffee resemblance I have ever had packed into a beer, and I like it!

471,"2004-01-18",3.9,"Opaque with frothy tan head and brown ring, good lacing. The aromas hint of smoky burnt dark and chocolate malts, espresso, touch of molasses, mild berries, aromatic hops, and dusty yeast esters. The taste is bitter and twangy, coffee and chocolate at the forefront (piney notes show up at the end). Undertones of peat and salt, wood, and chalky yeast. The finish is a tad too short but some bitterness and smoky characters do linger around a bit. The mouthfeel has a crisp and lively nature, very dry. Interesting to say the least, more a dry stout than anything else, and a darn good one at that. Be ready for a surprise, a love it or hate it brew. Not an extra stout however. Another stout via Acrodizer, thanks buddy!","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Carbonation is light but a good thick tan head forms and sticks around awhile. Nice roasty malt profile up front with a noticeable, but not overpowering hop presence in the finish.

It's black, it's dark and there are some ruby edges to it when the light is there. The head is thick and light brown.The aroma is weird. Where is this 95 rating coming from? Has some coffee notes but nothing standing out really. Body is on the thin side. Flavor is bitter and reminding me of that nasty Java Stout from Bells. Has some roasted malt flavors and more like spent coffee grinds in my opinion. The bottle reads ""Limited Release"" and let me tell you,it should be as limited as possible.

A little richer than most Dry Stouts, I like what they are going for with a blend of Dry and Imperial Stout in the body. Coffee flavor really comes through in the flavor, along with some dark chocolate and roasted malt. The finish is dry and has a lightly hopped character. This might not be worth all the X's but it is still a good Stout.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

471,"2003-06-22",4.2,"Feb 2002, draught.  Went to Pike Brewery with some friends and got the sampler.  I was pleased by the other five beers, but devastated that I only had six ounces in a little toy glass of this beauty.  Luckily, one of my companions became a friend forever by giving me her XXXXX Stout!  I don't know if the beer's lack of a head came from the fact that they had to put together 4 samplers and bring them to us, so I can't rate the appearance a 5.  Next time I'm in Seattle I'll pick up a growler for a more scientific tasting process.  It's a beautiful beer, though.  A rare sunny day in Seattle in February, and I could barely see the sun through this near-opaque beauty.  This is the beer that made me fall in love with stouts.  Hell, I think it may have made me fall in love with beer!","Sunset Valley, Texas, USA","verbivore"

471,"2002-12-23",3.8,"Nice pour, deep opaque black with an easy, thick creamy head that clings to the sides of the glass. Its not exactly long-lasting, but it never fully fades (ends up thin cream layer thats too thick for a film, but kind of like a like coat of moss or lichens). The aroma is a little weak, but roasty. The flavor is as strong as it should be but it dominated and unbalanced by too much burned bitterness. A bit of smokiness lingers underneath. The lack of balance makes this less than a joy to drink, but intriguing at the same time.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

Excellent roasted coffee malt with just th right amount of bitterness. Nice warm full flavor and body with the the right amount of smokiness. A little linear, as their is nothing astoundingly original here, but just an incredibly balanced tasty stout. 2/1/04 - I feel it's important to keep ratings up to date as time passes, because beers change, so after trying a new batch of this is winter of '04 I felt this took a slight turn for the worse.
