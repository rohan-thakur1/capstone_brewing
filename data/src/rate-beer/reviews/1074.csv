1074,"2015-07-24",3.1,"Bottle. Vintage 2013. A clear, still cider with a few bubbles on top. Rather low on pears in the aroma, with some cores and grass. Generic fruityness and some faint piney hints. Its medium bodied, semi-dry and smooth on the palate, with pear, pear cores and grass. Some peel from yellow apples. Far from exciting this one, but tasteful and easy drinkable. Would be nice with some pork chops I think. 150724","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

The pears make a nice blend with the apple with a touch of sourness. Some sweetness but not overly so.

1074,"2014-08-03",3.0,"2013 Bottle from App Vintner - pours clear pale gold, tiny bubbles. Aroma is big pineapple, green apples, and earthiness. This is on the sweet side with sour undertones. It is very syrupy. They have adjusted the formula some increasing the pears to 62%, 36% apples, and 2% quince. Im not sure what quince tastes like, so I cant tell you if its very present in the beer.","Virginia, USA","magsinva"

Tasty stuff...not that complex, but bright clean fruit, a nice background wild note, and well-balanced.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1074,"2014-01-15",4.1,"2011 Bottle
Pours perfectly clear & pale with some head around the edge and lots of tiny bubbles in the glass. 

The aroma is very akin to a dry white wine, its got bright fruit and fruit blossom notes, some light waxiness... some mild wildflower stuff... not a ton of apple or pear but a little. 

The flavor is extremely dry, not unlike a brut champagne... but more tart even more bracing at moments. Its got some white grape, and again just light touches of the pears and apples. 

The mouthfeel is very very prickly and lively. 

I get why people dont dig it, but man this is right up my alley.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
1074,"2014-01-09",3.3,"11 bottle. Very clear gold. Nice effervescence. Aromas of pear and sweet apples. Fairly thin, dry, but not compared to say a brut champagne or the like. Pear and dry apple flavors, but off dry. Some vanilla. Tasty but nothing behind it...shallow and empty finish.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"

Pear skin, light spice, some vanilla in the flavor, and champagne-like oakiness. Really delicate apple / pear flavor. Bright, soft champagne-like stronger carbonation.

1074,"2013-06-05",3.2,"Bottle. Hmmmmm.....pours a dusty gold-yellow with green highlights. Nose is definitely apple forward, but theres some lactic highlights and what I can only conclude is quince. (I cannot say in good conscience Im a quince expert.) Bone-dry on the palate -- puts me in mind of Basque ciders, with a savory, funky front of the mouth and a soft, but still dry close. The finish stays forever and ever, and it grew on me. Very, very interesting.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"
1074,"2013-05-05",3.5,"2011 dated 750ml.  clear pale yellow body with seltzer water effervescence.  mild generic apple / pear aroma with softer touches of unripe kiwi and lemon meringue pie.  substantial calcium carbonate and granite / spring water mineral character; some sea salt / sand notes; soft apple + pear expression but missing any distinct quince note (and me being unfamiliar with quince, which I hear is basically a pear). light body; between dry and semi-dry (not bone-dry as the bottle says); mild unripe apple and pear with suggestions of lemon custard. increasing malic acid in the finish (bitter, astringent, acidic apple skins). its not deep or complex and develops no depth over the course of a sip or a glass.  well-made but very static.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1074,"2013-05-04",3.3,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2014 2011 vintage, clear, filtered, very carbonated. Was very excited to see a cider coming from a winery, especially Bonny Doon, renowned for their sense of humor as much as their quality. Hope this is a growing trend.
Nose: Mild, hints of cinnamon over a rich apple. Some funk, BO. Undertones of mild floral and soap, key lime pie custard.
Mouth: Clean. Calcium, dry oyster shells, salt spray, unripe kiwi over the pear and apple notes. Somewhat plain, but nicely thirst quenching. Off dry. No flaws, pretty unexciting. Light bodied, frothy soda fizzy.
This was a bit pricey, so probably wouldnt buy again, but certainly would recommend a try.","denver, Colorado, USA","ephemeral8"
