Delicious citrussy hop aroma, tons of vanilla creaminess from the wheat. Pale cloudy orange, small tight head. Wow! I have just had a spooky out-of-body experience from the taste and sensation. For a brief moment I was transported to another plane. I was no longer in the pub, no longer hearing the noise of the customers and their glasses, it was just me, and this beer, and it was wonderful. Full palate, but refreshing too. Creamy light wheaty grains in the taste, but beatiful fruity hops. Utterly magical wheat beer. Wow! (Comments previously made about UK brewers and wheat beers do not apply here, obviously.)","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
