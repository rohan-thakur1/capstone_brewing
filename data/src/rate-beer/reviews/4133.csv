>>> A monster sipper mead with an insane amount of honey sweetness and a nice touch of raspberries to make it more palateable. 

-  Clear dark amber and it leaves long sticky legs on the glass (+) 
-  Theres an impressive amount of rich honey in the nose (+), but the alcohol is also quite present so its a bit boozy (-) 
-  The sweetness from honey is huge and success to hide the alcohol (+) 
-  Raspberries presence in both aroma is subtle (especially when compared to Schramms), but add a nice fruity and acidic (mild) dimension to the mead (+) 
-  The body is really thick and the sweetness is mouth coating and lingers a long time before being partially cut by a mild acidic presence (+) 
-  This is meant to be drink 1 oz at a time

4133,"2013-12-29",4.5,"This is my 1000th rating. I chose to rate this particular mead for a reason ; I come from Poland and this seams to be the best Polish delicacy on RB. 
The bottle 50cl made of ceramic. 
It has a deep red color. It leaves clear stains on the glass.
NOSE : from far this mead has a wood like smell with strong aromas of fruits. Obviously the honey is on top layer. The fruit aromas are quite complex. Mostly red berry fruits. The aromas of booze comes up when putting the nose into the sniffer. After a while of oxidation it wares off. The quality of the honey aromas is just amazing. It has also notes of toffee and burned caramel. Even some chocolate. Roses. 
SIP : it is oily and sticky. It is quite thick. The feeling is very intense. The sweetness literally invades my mouth. Its quite a shock whenever it touches my taste buds. Behind the top layer of sweetness it gets a bit acidic. It reveals complex fruit and flower notes. Aftertaste is sweet with aromas of rose dominating the palate. 
OVERALL : its really a delicacy. Maybe not something one might choose to get drunk but something definitely to cheer up with.","Warszawa, POLAND","Swaroga"

Insanely sweet, well beyond cloying level, though it is still decadent as hell. The booze is well-hidden, as the sweetness overtakes everything.

4133,"2013-07-15",4.2,"800th RATING! This is also my first real mead rating. I thought I would start with one of the worlds best meads. Actually, it was the #1 mead on RateBeer when I purchased the bottle, but apparently B. Nektar and Kuhnhenn have now relegated this back to the #3 mead in the world. Cool corked 750 ml bottle with red wax, purchased 15 months ago at Bine & Vine ($46.99). Pours at room temperature a red - brown - dark amber color that looks almost exactly like brewed tea and with no foam/head whatsoever. AROMA of port, candied raspberries, dark honey, cinnamon schnapps, raisin, stickly treacle / molasses, with a noticeable sweet alcoholic heat. FLAVOR has much of what is found in the nose with notes of port wine, Red Hots cinnamon candy, sticky raspberries and raisins, maple, thick caramel and molasses, and some warming alcohol. Finishes sweet (more port notes) and with a lightly burning cinnamon sensation. Its boozy and sweet, but with lots of great underlying complexity. I am admittedly not rating to style (as this is only the second time Ive ever had mead), but simply on my subjective enjoyment of the beverage which was significant. I quite like good port and other dessert wines, so this was right up my alley. Certainly a sipper...this bottle should last me quite a while.

The aroma is pungent and chock full o honey. Im catching only a minimal amount of fruit in the aroma, however there are some oaky spicy almost tequila like notes to the aroma. Some limestone is in the aroma as well, but one thing is sure the thing smells huge and rich. 

The flavor is incomparable, simply unique... far too acidic to compare to any of the dessert wines Ive had, but I also know precious little about these wines. This is obviously far closer to a dessert wine than anything that Ive come to know as ""Mead"" living in the Midwest United States. The honey is the dominant flavor, but the fermentation is very clean and the alcohol character, while noticeable provides a light spiciness and warmth as opposed to any real ""boozy"" elements. The raspberry flavor is subdued but ever present. The oakiness is mild but certainly contributes well to the character of the Mead. Some sort of fortified wine character, but this is not nearly as boozy or sweet as many of those.  

The palate is absolutely huge, sharp at the front but also enormously viscous and mouth coating. The finish is long and the flavor of the mead lingers and lingers.

Been looking forward to this one ever since it was published for the gathering: the worlds top ranked mead! :-) Lets see if theres any substance to the claim. First off all: the looks on this thing is simply fantastic. A deep amber-hued clear golden body with a coppery hue resides majestically in the glass, reminiscent of a tropical sunset. It really looks like some kind of cognac or fine brandy rather than fermented honey. :-) Nose is complex layers of heather honey, rose, raspberries, syrup and vanilla. Hints of wood and caramelized sugars. Taste is equally nice; super-sweet, sticky tones of intense honey, flowers, raspberries and vanilla with hints of wood, syrup and mild straw. Mouthfeel is compact and sweet, and this is nothing you can down a pint of at any point but then again: thats not the point. Delicious aftertaste of rose petals with hints of red berries. Absolutely stunning and a real eye-opener; I never knew that a mead could be this sweet, complex and enjoyable at the same time. Need to get more of this for sure.

There is notes of raspberries, floral, the honey is high quality with it smelling like the raw beehive honey.  Taste starts out with some sweet raspberry and floral notes, the sweet versions of that for sure, and dives right into the honey afterwards.  Nectar honey with lots of sweetness but also the rawness of it really makes it tasty.  There is a ton, TON, of honey in this and it really makes it sweet but thats what they were going for.  Slight retronasal burn but no alcohol in the taste, and a slight warming in the belly.  Palate is not too thick to prevent too much coating, but is nice and makes the taste last.

4133,"2010-06-08",4.6,"Wicker-wrapped bottle - I love the presentation! Pours clear orange, very syrupy, with nice legs - no carbonation, of course. The nose is big and boozy, like a sort of light whiskey, with a sweet maple syrup tone and rich fruit notes - pear, in particular. Flavor is extremely rich and sweet, nice and boozy - rather hot and alcoholic, but in a good way. Sticks very heavily to the palate. An experience, to be sure - its rather difficult to describe just how unique and amazing this mead is. Definitely one of the richest and most flavor-filled beverages Ive experienced.","Houston, Texas, USA","jumpjet2k"

4133,"2010-06-02",4.2,"BA review: 05-06-2007 

The bottle ive had sitting on the shelf finally gave me a sign today to open it. It slipped, landed on the floor, and smashed the red wax seal on the front. Miraculously, the heavy bottle was still intact, leaving a dent in the wood floor. 

4oz. serving in a shotglass. Crystalline amber jewel tone. Legs appear with a gentle swirl of the glass. 

Aroma is potent, raw honey, with a toned down indication of its high-octane nature. Slight oak-barrel woodiness in the background. 

Syrupy, sticky, and palate-coating. Raw honey, clover, oak, and candy sweetness. Slight heat from the abv, but not overpowering in small sips. Wouldnt want more than a tiny sample once and awhile. Great digestif/nightcap, despite the sugar rush...","RIP Johnnies, Chicago, Illinois, USA","emerge077"
4133,"2010-05-31",4.2,"Bottled. A deep red-brown mead. The aroma has strong notes of honey and pollen. The flavor is very sweet - though not cloying with strong notes of honey, spices, and alcohol, leading to a sweet, but dry and spicy finish.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

Good thing you dont really need that much of this one to get a good feel for it.  Pours a viscous gold color with ruby highlights.  Aroma of honey, maple syrup, cognac, and raspberries.  The flavor follows suit closely, with a super thick, syrupy honey base, some definite raspberry accents, and warming alcohol.  Full-bodied, with a thick, mouth-coating syrupy feel, no carbonation of course, and sweetness all the way through.  Drinking this is a really unique, interesting, enjoyable experience.

Smell: Boldly fragrant nose smelling deeply of, natch, top-shelf honey, but also fresh florals and hand-picked fruit and wafting alcohol.

Taste: Starts with a strong, rich taste of notably sweet honey. Its got a dark candy quality about it and a small amount of background toasted nuttiness. Present though restrained jelly-like fruitiness. Small snifters worth of belly warming cognac. Peppery alcoholic accents. Finishes with both warmth and sweetness to spare.

Mouthfeel: A bit beyond medium-bodied, its both smooth and sticky in the mouth.

Poured a clear, thick, coating liquid with a golden amber hue, and just a few small, short- lived bubbles floating on the collar of the brew. A slight wisp of soy set me back a little, with the remainder of the aroma a pleasant, perfumy fruit, alcohol, and honey.

4133,"2009-05-09",4.5,"Once one has tasted the sweet, heavenly nectar of real mead, there can be no going back. All other imitations pale to but a wisps shadow in comparison. With each succulent, delicate, sweet honey kiss I remember why mead was once the imbuement of choice; demi-gods, royalty, Vikingsand so on.


Liquid gold shimmers in the light with vibrant amber melting throughout her thick body. Copper glints along the sides of my glass while a heavenly aroma whispers sweet nothings to my heart. Thick, sticky, fresh honey atop a crunchy honeycomb envelops as soft warm spices of nutmeg, cinnamon, and caramelized brown sugar tease. A sense of soft wood permeates her aroma, giving Jadwiga a rustic feeling. It is liquid history I cradle in my hands so it is with somber delight I raise my glass to trembling lips. My lips glisten with the residue of her liquid bounty while my tongue is a soft sticky mess of honeycomb, ghostly raspberry, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Warmth slowly spreads from the top of my head to my tippy-toes, pervading every fiber of my being. Each sip is warm and sweet with a nip of spices in the back while delicate raspberry whispers upon a fickle wind. Her body is perfectly balanced; neither too thick nor too thin, but with just the right viscosity and stickiness. Thankfully, even as my glass empties, I still have more of Jadwigas liquid gold tucked safely away in the safe confines of her decorated bottle.


I find it unfortunate that real mead is almost an extinct spirit here in the States. I cant speak for the rest of the world, but Poland has a vibrant appreciation for meads and multiple meaderies to prove it. There is an underground, grass-roots mead movement in the states, but I have yet to taste any that could even come close to the perfection Apis has achieved. If you should come across any of their meads, bring home a couple bottles because the first will be gone sooner than you expect.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

4133,"2009-04-06",4.3,"1001.  Thanks for sharing Yaniv!  What a treat!  Pours a darkish golden reddish brown, perfectly still.  Full broad honey sweet.  Alcohol.  Full honey richness and yet slightly ethereal and otherworldly.  Raspberry is definitely in there.  Fuller rich flat body.  Full deep sweet honey over light raspberry.  Some brown sugar and perhaps even a slight hint of light molasses.  Treacle or demerara might be a bit closer perhaps.  Lingering honey stays for some time.

4133,"2009-03-21",4.2,"Bottle pours dark red/amber color with no carbonation.  Aroma is strong dessert wine, or very boozy.  Pours in the glass and coats it like syrup.  When I swirl it in my snifter it has legs.  Very heavy mouthfeel.  Flavor is very complex.  Alcohol, an almond or nutty flavor, very sweet from the honey, and finishes with some alcohol heat.  This reminds me more of a Port Wine than a mead.  And its a fine one at that!","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"

The flavor though is where this drink shines. The flavour is silky homey. It just coats my throat, sweet honey, mild, but also strong. There is a nice alcohol burn mixed with a nice sweet/tart berries finish. this is quite complex. there is so much moe going on but i cont put my finger on it.

4133,"2009-02-04",4.1,"Im not a big fan of sweet drinks, but this is an exception.  I like this so much I keep some of it around most of the time.  To me, it tastes like sherry wine with honey.  You sip this rather than ""drink"" it.  Very silky and smooth in the mouth.  So good I usually hold it my mouth a bit before swallowing.  A bit expensive but very highly recommended.

Pours an unassuming clear amber with no carbonation or head.  Smell is extremely honey like with light notes of pear and fruitiness wafting out as well.  Taste was incredibly sweet and cloying and was like chugging thinned out honey with a light fruitiness attached to it.  Syrupy body and smooth despite the 16% ABV, which was well hidden.  Still, it was incredibly difficult to drink 1 ounce over 20 minutes and was just incredibly cloying and unbalanced.

Poured a copper color, like a cognac.  Aroma was sweet, some alcohol, sweet and flowery.  The taste starts off quite sweet, maple syrup, small alcohol bite, strawberries.  Super thick, it sticks to the glass like some kind of lacquer.  The best part of this mead, as with all great drinks, is the great lasting finish.  I take a sip, swallow, and let the flavor slowly fade.  At first I found it slightly too sweet and cloying.  But after I finished my first serving, I found myself craving it an hour later, and craving it this morning as well.

4133,"2008-05-30",4.7,"(cool looking wicker bottle from gunhaver, thanks Geiger!)  This had to be my 400th rating.  Pours dark amber and literally coats the entire glass upon swirling.  The aroma is just incredible with smells of caramel, raspberries, a lot of sweet honey, and every so often I smelled a scent of chocolate cake.  The taste was nothing short of spectacular, with raisin, honey, caramel, and raspberry all mixing together to create one of the best tasting amalgamations that has ever graced my tastebuds.  I would love to give the palate a ten on this if I could, as the whole liquid coats the mouth and leaves an amazingly long sweet raspberry finish.  This mead is just really thick and viscous.  Another amazing thing about the Jadwiga is that the 16% abv is never even noticed in both smell or taste, which is quite an impressive feat by the brewer to pull that off.  I liked this drink so much I was hesitant to even finish the rest, but smelled it for an extra ten more minutes before consuming.

Its reminiscent of a great dessert wine or liqueur. This is so good!  Very thick, rich, and sticky with a good bite in the throat. I was informed that this mead would show me what constitutes a 5 for mead palate, and I was informed correctly. Its just great across the board. This is better than any beer that Ive ever had. Some beverages have the ability to be fundamentally better than others (as I know well as a whiskey fan; Ive had at least 10 whiskeys better than any beer Ive ever tasted). Perhaps mead has a higher upside than beer. Thats something I never thought Id say before I tried Apis Póltorak Jadwiga. This came very close to getting my first 5. I am holding out some hope that I will be able to rate something even more highly, but Im not holding my breath. This is a steal of a deal at just $30 a bottle.

Whos to go against that?

Taste is the same with the raspberry slightly more subdued than in the aroma, and much more hidden than the fruit in the Kurpiowski. Really thick--pretty much just like slightly thinned down honey, and super smooth.  A very well crafted, amazing mead, but I did not enjoy the raspberry as much as the black currant in the Kurpiowski. Overall it was still slightly better though, due to the alcohol being held in check with this one.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"

It pours like slightly thinned down honey, not water with honey in it.  A single drop missed the glass and landed on my notepad where I was starting my notes for this beer.  See?  Divinely approved.  Dark copper color.  Smells of lightly toasted oak and a very dark honey.  Im not too good with my honey varietals yet, but I believe this would be a darker, more earthy kind of wildflower honey.  Ridiculously thick body.  Crushing wildflower honey taste.  Some oak and super sweet.  Bordering on a dessert wine.

Pours a crystal clear translucent orange amber color, with a syrupy texture.  Lovely looking.  Smells of a delicious combination of sweet honey, apples, plums, alcohol heat, and a floral meadow.  The flavor is silky smooth on the palate, just sliding along the tongue to the throat in divine fashion.  The honey is quite profound up front, really making its presence known and eliminating any doubt that it is a mead.  The fruits really are abundant in the finish.  Apples and plums, maybe some pear, and sweet nectar of the Gods all mix together to form the main balance to the intense honey flavors.  The alcohol was apparent, but took nothing away from the character or flavor of this wonderful concoction.  A truly wonderful experience.

Pours deep gold, going toward a dark straw to light coppery honey color, with minimal head that dissipates quickly and never really returns in any noticeable amount.  The nose is luscious; honey mixed with raspberries and floral rosewater hints.  The flavor is bold, brash, pure honey mixed with a touch of raspberry notes and mild floral notes.  It does get a tiny bit hot, but that heat is integrated so well into the flavor that is never offensive.  I paid $38 bucks for my bottle, and it was worth every penny.

Ive been waiting quite some time to try this and finally...the time has come.  Pours a rich, deep golden color.  One of the first things I noticed about this was the transparent film it leaves on the snifter as its swirled and the aroma that hits the nose from about 10 feet away.  The initial alcohol burn invades the olfactory region and quickly fades to a rich, dark honey sensation with soft herbal-like qualities and some cream notes.  Very thick mouth feel, almost too syrup-like but still amazing.  Sweet, dark, floral honey pretty much overwhelms the taste but their are some brown sugar and ?banana? notes present that give it some additional complexity.

Pours a great redish golden with no head, nice lacing of alcohol on the glass. Aroma is great, sweet but balanced. Light honey, oak, maple, port and apples. Super sticky oily mouthfeel. Very sweet flavour, raisins dominating amongst soft maple honey. Then is burns a little from the alcohol before exploding with a stunning mix of flowers, apples and light raspberries.

Pours a clear garnet with tan highlights  and really sticky legs along the glass.  Pretty hot on the nose, but theres plenty of vanilla, maple, and rum.  Tastes sweeter than a spoonful of sugar, and damn if I didnt love the flavor.  Tons of maple, vanilla, brown sugar, honey and raisins.  Very thick, sticky, and incredibly good, unfortunately my notes dont go beyond that.

4133,"2007-12-28",4.4,"The Queen pours a stunning dark amber honey color with mild aromas of spice and acids. This already tells me Im in for a treat. Jad lays heavy on the palate and leaves nothing to be desired. Its luscious, chewy, and seductive. I can see why they call it the Honey Moon wine. You want dessert, well, you got it ten fold. This stuff is thick and viscous like fresh poured 30WT. Its not as complex as I imagined but tastey with a defined roasted honey component. Mildly spiced and perfectly balanced armed with its penetrating acidity. This is fat and decadent with mild nuances of candy necklace and caramel apple. The finish is long and lasting with a slight acidic twitch. Overall: Jadwiga actually lacks the strong musty tones found in most Mead. Probably due to its aging. I wouldnt call this a dissapointment.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"
4133,"2007-12-26",4.5,"Bottle thanks to Solan!  Thanks again.  The aroma is lots of sugars, honey, raspberry in the slightest amount, and phenol alcohol...lots of it!  This damn near burns my nose when smelling it!  However...even with that detractor this stuff is still effin unbelievable!!  I have had multiple samples of it over the past week and a half or so and I have come to the conclusion that I simply must always have a bottle of this on hand at all times.  It was a little overbearing at first, but now I cant get enough of this stuff.  The flavor is lots of residual sugars, sweet sweet honey elixir without being too syrupy or cloying.  There is also just a little hint of the alcohol but it is very welcoming in this sipper.  And at 16% alcohol...it really should be a sipper.  Overall fantastic stuff, and it has definitely set me up to embark on finding more meads!","Green, Ohio, USA","LeopoldStoch"
4133,"2007-12-02",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2007 Wow. I wasnt sure heading in how much Id like this - all of the few meads Ive tried so far have been very unimpressive, with unpleasant acetone/solventy type flavors. This one: absolutely none of that. As good as I might have imagined this, this beats it. Beautiful big sweet honey aromas and flavors, with an earthy almost farmy background. Actually the farmy component reminds me of something very specific: the horse barns at the state fair, with aromas of horse sweat and urine soaked hay. But thats not to say this seems like brett or lambic. Not at all. Rounded clean palate. Easy finish. Hardly any hint of its potent alcoholic strength. I poured this into a dessert wine glass, and just couldnt help but treat myself to 3 or 4 more pours. I dont think this is going to be able to last long in my house! Surprisingly dark color, a tawny caramel type brown. Im not doing a great job making this sound great, but it was.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

The aroma has sweet honey, heather, liquor-like and spices.  The body is very thick smooth and velvety and just glides through its entire journey.  The taste has honey, sugar, syrup, hint of berry and dark toffee.  The alcohol is quite apparent, but works as a positive instead of a negative ~ just the right amount showing through.  A terrific mead that I hope to enjoy again.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

Intensely sweet, as expected, but not really cloying.  Feels syrupy in the mouth at first but lightens out and becomes airy in a menthol kind of way.  Very much like a sherry, hints of wood.

Something about 25 yrs aging, and something, about winning awards in 1996 on the bottle. No signs of oxidation.  Im not sure if a mead is subject to oxidation in the same way as beer.  Very sweet.

The aroma is huge with sweet honey, red wine tannins, some mild alcohol and hints of wood. The mead enters thick, chewy and sludgingly sludgy. The honey hits first then it is followed by a quick burst of red wine tannins then very sweet honey and a hint of wood. It ends with honey, sugar and faint alcohol. I also am starting to get mild dark fruity esters. This is a thick product leaving behind sweetness and honey behind far into the after taste.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4133,"2007-11-04",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 24, 2008 Poured from a 750 ml bottle.  Glowing amber appearance; a thin syrup.  Honey, pineapple, and burnt toffee aroma; fried ice cream slathered with a rich maple reduction.  Intensely and impossibly sweet, but within reason, still, somehow.  Flavor dances with a tangy, bright, hot rhythm; syrupy honey, coconut milk, almond frosting.  Forceful and soft, and far from one-dimensional; trills of watermelon and canteloupe ring out brightly and quickly over the top.  Toffee candy and pineapple sugar bring it back in the finish, concluding an extended, viscous, and sticky texture that penetrates every corner of the mouth.  Pushes heat out the nose; graham and tanned marshmallow linger indefinitely.  The exemplar of sugary overkill somehow rendered pleasant.  A regal, luxurious experience all around, even if its sweetness bears a little heavy for my taste.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

The aroma was intense with sweetness. I knew the flavor was going to be big, but this was huge on flavor. Had huge honey flavors with some floral flavors in the background. The alcohol warmth was there, but not overpowering. The alcohol was masked really well. The mouthfeel was very full, slick and sticky to the palate. I have experienced nothing like it.

Medium-dark clear amber color, no visible carbonation as this stuff pours nearly like syrup.

Pours a dark shiny orange with no head at all, which is to be expected. Aroma: Holy cow, what an aroma! Wood, slightly burnt caramel, brown sugar, fruit, alcohol, honey and much more, theres so much going on in this complex aroma. Flavour: Holy fuck, Im pretty sure this is the best tasting beverage Ive ever had. WOW! Where to begin? Sweet taste of wood, honey, fruit, spices, alcohol, nuts and...gah, words cant describe how amazing it tastes...I dont want it to end. You can barely taste the 16% alcohol at all -- crazy!

Very complex and absolutely lovely.","Hässelby, SWEDEN","Svesse"
4133,"2007-09-12",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 12, 2007 My home bar contains a myriad of decadent alcohol. There are many beverages I always have on hand, but the list of favorites is small: Laphroaig 15 year old Islay Scotch, Imperia Vodka, Cazadores Reposado Tequila, Orval Trappist Ale, any number of Grand Marque Cognacs, varying first-growth Bordeaux, assorted lambics...and this nectar of such divinity...it is nearly indescribable. Any random sip is as rewarding as the first; surely the current bottle will never be the last. 
The pour is the antithesis of tumultuous and astonishing in its vivid display of dense colors, bright and concentrated purity in a form so pristine a photograph would never do it justice. Translucent dark amber, apparent impenatrable molecular composition revealing swirling hues of ruby, sunburst orange, merengue yellow and liquidified bronze, shrouded in an oily cocoon. Thick legs seem wildly strewn about. Never has a still pour revealed such character and essence of life.
Scents of barrels that previously housed cognac and sherry spring to life as the glass is drawn to the nose. The richest and most expensive honeys, intricate in detailed spice and variations, follow soon after. Elegant sherry glides forward, blanketed behind fiercely sweet aged honey. The honey seems incredibly old and holds dominion over all else in the glass. The rose and raspberry puree create a distinct, underlying, complex backnote but are unidentifiable as separate additions. Also noted are light smoke, tangerine peel, powdered molasses, figs and indeterminate dried fruits. What remarkable variation and glorious eloquence stems from such a simple yet painstakingly crafted fermentation and aging. A gentle touch is at hand, despite copious infiltration of honey in gargantuan proportions to water and yeast.
A sweetness unlike any other is paramount in the flavor, but this beverage only seems cloying if sipped too quickly. This is certainly a mead for sharing, for long contemplative sips, a bottle to enjoy over a week, month or perhaps longer. Sweet, venomous nectar at the forefront of each sip - the only viable antidote is the refreshment and intoxicating mosaic of the initial moment this touches the tip of the tongue for a second time. Acidity is low in feeling, though in reality it must be enormous to be even this noticeable and cut through and scatter a minor portion of sticky honeyed sweetness. Alcohol is warming instantly, much like the Cognac that falsely masquerades through the nose. The finish is sweet and smooth, very warming and comforting, lightly fruity with lingering peppery spice and earthy cooling. The contrast of warmth and chills in the finale is exhuberating.
The mouthfeel is as full bodied as maple syrup, possibly moreso, certainly much more density than is found in a typical(or an atypical) mead or similar. Viscous doesnt do the slick feeling justice. Biting tannins are only dulled at the edges due to the honey bath theyre awash in. This is so phenomenal. I truly wish I could let everyone I know sample this staggering achievement, and I shall do my best. Simply breathtaking. This mead redefined decadence when I first sampled it years ago and continues to shape my opinions on the subject today.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

The pours a nice deep clear amber with solid legs. Wonderful and addictive aroma of dark honey, flowers, and caramel. Mouthfeel is full and syrupy without being sticky. Flavor of rich dark honey, cherry, and maple syrup with lots of sweetness. However this falls short of being cloying, and the alcohol is almost undetectable. At 16%, this is very dangerous.

4133,"2007-08-19",4.2,"Bottle, (from State Line Liquors, Elkton, MD) Pours clear reddish amber with no head (about as exciting as a mead can look). Sweet honey and alcohol aroma, as expected, but a little more floral than other meads that Ive sampled. Strong, very sweet honey flavor, with berries, brown sugar, vanilla, and maple syrup notes. Alcohol makes its presence felt in the finish, but not to the extent I expected. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel. really great mead.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"

Beautiful blend of honey, cognac, and flowers on the nose.  Alcohol is quite apparent, though not unpleasant, in the aroma.  The flavor is very sweet, with honey and a wide spectrum of floral tastes melding perfectly together.  The sweetness hides the alcohol quite well, though not completely.  Thick, syrupy mouthfeel, which is expected.  The body is very slick on the tongue, and quite pleasant. Sweet, smooth finish.  Excellent as a desert drink.

Bottle:  Aroma of honey and tequilla with enough alcohol to tingle the nose.  It pours a transparent orange with no head.  This literally has legs after swirling it around the glass.  I imagine for a mead, appearance does not get any better.  The flavor has honey, apple, and a hint of maple syrup.  There is a faint alcohol burn in the finish, but only the slightest flavor.  Its sweeter and not as vinous as other meads Ive had.  It has a sticky and coating mouthfeel.

Who is fooling me here???? The highest rated Mead. What the fuck. I guess this is the most boring drink I have ever had that I wouldnt define as bad.

4133,"2007-06-13",4.2,"My first mead ever and probably the best Ill ever drink. The aroma is a welcoming precursor to the taste. Incredible Lotus-honey scent that leads to intense sweet-honey thats a Doppleganger around an encompassing mouthfeel. The sweetness is so intense--like drinking 5 blends of Port--my mouth can only handle small sips. It cloys the throat on the way down while congealed heat warms the esophagus. Truly fascinating to drink. I feel like a Knight of the Round Table while consuming.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","Floback"

I dont exactly know why, but this tasted like some nasty cough syrup, somewhat reminding me of some decent desert wines that I have enjoyed, but while reminicient of good tasting drink, this itself was NASTY, again, cough syrup with honey and port poured in, but not in a good day.

4133,"2007-06-06",3.9,"My first mead, and quite an opening act! Hailed as one of the finest examples I was both excited and intimidated. My expectations were high, yet what exactly I expected, I did not know. Its orangy rose hue appeared bright and clear hinting at its mellifluous nature. No head was present but prominent legs lined the glass in an almost mathematical arrangement. Upon the nose, alcohol strikes with great vigor, the waxy properties of honey are present, but almost sugar free. Efflorescent aromas of lilac, honeysuckle and lily of the valley add to the subtle complexity, further accreting with cream, maple and a white wine tonality. The abundance of sugar only becomes apparent on the palate and lends texture to the heavy alcohol notes. The viscous liquid is far more satisfying to the taste as it dissolves on the tongue in an almost crystalline fashion. Honeysuckle is omnipresent, as if the nectar of a hundred flowers was dripped into my glass. The complex amalgam of light honey flavors reminds of blueberry blossom, clover and acacia varieties, an ultimately soothing sensation, and a reminder of how remarkable nature really is. With time, delicate accents are revealed, peach and apricot, hints of orange and Charentais melon, add to the fruity sensation. Almond extract, clove and licorice are also noticeable with effort. The smooth and uncarbonated syrup seeps deep into the veins, warming on its way to the tips of your fingers. Though I dont doubt the eminence of this mead, I can hardly see an appropriate time to drink it, and even on that rare occasion I find that a good tawny port would provide greater fulfillment.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"
4133,"2007-06-01",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2007 The aroma is dominated by pruns, figs and you can sense the alcohol too.

The flavor has a delightful, full honey flavor with rose hips, honey comb, and suggestions of red wine.

The alcohol is very smooth for something this high.

Body was clear with a ruby red hue. What hits the nose was quite unexpected with notes of heavy malt. Honey, fruity, toasted, nutty, port wine or fortified wine/dessert wine. Lost of dark fruity notes as raisin, prunes and hints of spices. Full bodied with a sticky and slightly alcoholic texture and a totally flat carbonation. (Are there suppose to be any in Mead?).

And in between there is some vanilla, some sherry, some grapes, some strawberries, some vanilla...but all sooo subtle so as to not get in the way of the incredible honey.

The taste is primarily honey, extremely sweet with hint of metallic in the finish. Even before I read the description I picked out the rose flavor. Alcohol is almost imperceptible. I think by its nature it would be difficult to drink more than a few ounces at a time, and it produced massive cravings for water. With that, and having tried no other meads to date, I would say that its hard to imagine much better than this from a mead. (Bottle purchased at Julios).","Somerville, Massachusetts, USA","DrGonzo"
4133,"2007-01-22",4.1,"I finally got to try this, which many aficionados claim to be the end-all-be-all of Mead.  I saw it a few times in some liquor stores in the US, but was a little pricey for a style where Ive been burned so many times.  Big thanks to MDS for bringing this to the YEHa! party
Clear, stunning shade of bronze and totally oily, the legs on this is absolutely amazing.

Aroma is, in a word, intense.  Starts out woody, you can tell this stuff spent its fair share of time in the barrel.  Then this strange, catty, prunish overtone takes over, only to fade away eventually and then the honey takes over.  Dark, dark, almost burnt honeycombs, but really fresh, surprising since apparently this stuff is aged a long time.  You can almost feel the pollen and histamines tickle your nose.

Its thicker than double cream as you swallow it down, the sweetness is massive, and comes at you on varying levels, from soft, maple sugar to a more harsh rock candy sort of sweetness, with notes of cotton candy and mellow fruityness.  All this, and it hits you like those shots of honey and gin my grandma used to give us when we had sore throats.  Endless aftertaste, where the alcohol lingers and warms you slightly.  

It definately comes in as one of the sweetest meads Ive ever sampled, but it definately is cloying.  But there is a certain balance, in a warped kind of way, like a Triple IPA can be ""balanced"", I suppose it depends on your description of the term.  Even though I enjoyed Jadwiga I wouldnt drink a ton of this stuff, although Id take this over a port and about 80% of all dessert wines in a heartbeat, and it is worthy of the hype.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

Sweet but not overpowering aromas of honey, nectar, and rose petals with a slight alcohol nose.  The flavor is an experience that I will not forget: rose, nectar, and honey.

I definately enjoy this sweetness in a wine. Lotsa sweet honey flavors, spices,fruity, light nuttiness, light woody notes  with a hint of oxydation also. Alcohol makes itself known too.

Honey doesnt do this justice as a descriptor, it is like honey, but with allof honeys good attributes magnified by 10 and all of honeys poor attributes completely taken away.

4133,"2006-04-16",3.3,"UPDATED: SEP 14, 2006 Super sweet and syrupy.  Very complex.  Flavors of honey (obviously), apple, maple, flowers, raspberry, mint.  A bit of a medicinal touch at times, like nyquil.  I guess this would put you to bed just as easily.  Since this is the only mead Ive ever had, I cant compare it.  But, it is complex and tasty.  I just wouldnt be able to drink more than an ounce or two at a time.  
Rerate:  After finally finishing the bottle, I had to take the score down a bit.  Its just too cloying and sweet to deserve a 4.4. Nice complexity of flavors, as I said, but it gets very medicinal and nauseating very quickly.  Also, I dont like raspberries, so that might have an effect as well.

Whisky colored with thick legs and syrupy thickness. Aroma is intoxicating and beautiful, perfumed with florals and alcohol, wood and wine with an overwhelming honey presence. Rich, succulent flavor finds honey sweetness mellowed by oak with notes of brandy. At times it slides down ultra smooth, whereas other times its alcohol steps up to burn and be noticed. Regardless, this is nectar of the gods.

It may take some time for me to really appreciate meads more, but even three ounces was a task to finish.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

4133,"2005-07-14",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2005 I finely found a bottle of this, and in Arizona no less.  This mead is a brilliantly dark, ruby color.  The aroma is quite intoxicating, it is rich and satisfying.  There are heavy aromatic notes of alcohol, brandy, and a certain rich meatiness to this mead that is a note of oxidation character (definitely in a good way though).  Honey notes are definitely here as well, but the age of this mead has definitely aged the sharp notes that are present in fresh honey.  Really the aroma is quite enticing, and despite the evident alcohol notes this is worth nosing for quite some time, it has been 5 minutes and I have yet to taste this.

This is quite sweet up front, but not as thickly sweet as I was expecting.  The finish is quite interesting, there is a certain long note here that is slightly vegetal, but in a good way actually.  There is still quite a bit of sweetness here but it is well balanced with the rest of the mead.  This mead has notes of raisins, hints of cherries, and of course a nice, slightly astringent, and a nicely floral, nectar character (though I cant tell if this is from the rose or the honey).  This is really quite nice, and is not as sweet and cloying as I thought it would be, it is really quite well balanced for a strong aged mead.

4133,"2005-07-04",4.4,"Glass at Hopleaf.  Pour was a clear golden color with no head.  It had a not-too-thick syrupy consistency (kind of like warm maple syrup).  Aroma was of sweet alcohol, honey, vanilla, oak, and some faint floral.  Mouthfeel was like thin honey, and coated the mouth perfectly.  Honey, vanilla, and oak first hit the tastebuds, followed by an alcohol kick toward the back.  Lonly incredibly sweet honey finish.  This was absolutely fantastic, but too sweet for me to enjoy more than one glass in an evening.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
4133,"2005-07-01",4.5,"Bottle into snifter, cquirogas house and Hop Leaf (Chicago IL).  Um, damn.  Dope.  Wow.  Makes me want to become a mead maker.  Im still somewhat new to mead rating, so some of this might sound amateurish, but just take away from it the general impression of dopeness.  Golden clear in the glass with ""highlights"" of an orangish ruby color in the light.  The ""legs"" or ""tears"" or whatever are distinct and belie the alcohol, although its incredibly hidden in the mouth.  Smells of musty flowers with hints of the alcohol lurking underneath, maybe some melon?  Tastes like apple and flowers (meaning it tastes like the analog to its smell), sweet but not syrupy and overthetop.  The sweet finish lingers on the front of the tounge.  So smooth and perfect, I would dare to say balanced if I had any idea what that meant in terms of mead.  I do dare to say dope, as that is a universal qualifier and I have no doubts that it applies to this stuff.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

The taste is sweet, alcoholic, multi-layered swetness. Some acidity and rum notes as well as vanilla and lemony citrus. Somewhat fiery, but not too much. Not so sure how to rate, since I cant really compare to other meads, but it was lovely and a real treat. The bartender also filled the glass up to the very top, thanks!","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"
4133,"2005-05-09",4.3,"Rating #300.  Poured a still deep amber.  As I tilt my snifter, it leaves a thick syrupy coating along the sides.  Beatiful aroma of vanilla, oak, honey, a touch of fruit, and alcohol.  Very well-balanced bouquet.  Taste is very sweet with tastes of vanilla and cream with some light raspberries.  Very little honey taste or alcohol flavor.  Somewhat dry finish, laden with lots of vanilla.  Thick heavy syrupy body.  Though Ive only had 3 meads thus far, I can already present my agreement with the conclusion that this is the finest mead in the world.  Its one detractor is that it is so sweet it is almost sickening.  But this brew gets in A+ in pure brilliance of craftsmanship.

Strong, butterscotch aroma heavily laced with ripe apples, pears, sticky honey and an interesting earthy component.  Maple syrup text on the tongue, with a feel of whiskey through the finish.  Sugary flavours are most evident along side of the crazy stickiness which coats the lips and sooths the stomach.  The alcohol is evident only in the feeling you get after a few sips, not the flavour, which is full of sweet honey, tea, hints of anise, and just a quick touch of soy when you arent paying attention.

Had to wait to share this with Gasspasser and Alcoholist since we sampled the Kurpiowski together.  Awesome.  Clear deep copper amber body.  No head at all.  The aroma was sweet honey that developed notes of cognac, sherry, perhaps some maple.  The body was thick and nectary, smooth and silky in texture.  The flavor was ambrosia, sweet, honey, delicious.

4133,"2004-11-28",4.3,"11/12/04.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, obtained in a trade with JPDIPSO on RateBeer 11/1/04.  Dark orange-caramel color with no head or carbonation at all.  A very viscous, oily appearance with a different kind of lacing-- legs of alcohol like a wine or liqueur.  The thickness apparent here is amazing, almost gelatinous in the legs and body.  Aroma is literally breathtaking from the alcohol.  A very big burn with nutty, bright sweetness.  Very reminiscent of a fine sherry, harsh and blissful.  Flavor is sort of like an apple brandy, sugary with big alcohol (but really, this is huge all over), deep with raisin, dried fruit, and a lightly twiggy touch.  Absolutely terrific.  Very full body and super velvety texture, coating the mouth and throat like medicine, bringing out tons of mouthwatering goodness.  Finish is lightly drying, awesomely smooth.  Very long and elegant, complex and subtle.  Pecan, walnut, syrupy with delicious nuts.  Amazing stuff, coating the lips with a sugary, sticky film.  Warming and delicious.  Damn near divine.

4133,"2004-11-25",3.5,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2007 Bottle @ the DCMDVA Gathering.  Very viscous dark amber-beige colored mead with a good amount of auburn highlights.  Aroma of yellow, sugary, ripe fruits, brandy, sherry, alcohol, peach esters, more alcohol, strong honey.  Flavor is immensely powerful; sweet and alcoholic, it tastes like a mix of cognac and peach brandy, with perhaps a touch of peach schnapps.  Lovely fruit flavors and an incredibly thick, viscous body; sticky and decadent.  To style, it certainly stands out as the best strong honey dessert mead.  Finish is like taking an English barleywine and putting it through the eisbock process 3 or 4 times.  Its pure raisins and sugar.  I must say, it still is impossibly sweet and alcoholic.  Its grand, but Ill take a lighter mead any day.Rerate, at Sunset Grille, 9/10/2005.  Very educating to have this in the company of some other meads.  What I find is that, yes, this is a thick, sweet powerful mead, but it gets very one-dimensional.  Light brandy flavors, vanilla, almonds, and thick honey.  A bit boring by the end, which thins out considerably.  Abv is masked nicely, I will say.  There were 2 or 3 other meads Id prefer over this, though, even in the small sampling I did.

4133,"2004-11-22",4.8,"(Special thanks to cquiroga for sharing this mead when Argo came to visit San Diego.)  I strongly hesitate to rate this on a beer site because I really cant compare this to other beers, but instead to a dessert wine, or more accurately, a sherry.  I love beer, but my favorite alcoholic beverage is dessert wines, ports and sherries.  This incredible elixir smells like a cream sherry, very sweet, golden raisins.  It tastes like a cream sherry too, but perhaps slightly less sweet, and for obvious reasons, more honeyish.  The finish thins out a bit, so this doesnt hang on and on like the finest dessert wines.  Sweet, thick, dense, and coating palate, cloying for a beer, but fabulous for a dessert wine.  No head, but obviously thats expected.  Instead, we have legs streaming down the glass like a fine dessert wine.  Brown in color.  I think I like this mead better than any beer out there, so it should get perfect scores, at least for flavor.  The only reason I dont give this perfect scores across the board is because Ive had a few dessert wines, ports and sherries that I like a bit better.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Nice apple cider notes cause some tartness to try to balance the sweetness...but there is so much sweetness that balancing isnt possible...its a refined sipper for sure, and quite respectable at 17%...but the sweetness takes away from its exquisiteness...and brings out more noveltyness...which just sucks.

Dances along the line at the very edge of cloying without ever crossing into it. Syruppy sweet. Quite sticky and liqueur-like. Definitie alcohol warming.

Light salt hints, clover, herbs.. It will only get better though, in mouth, this has an insanely thick body, maple syrup thick and still, so round and after just a few sips, your lips want to stick together, needless to say its very cloying. Flowery tea biscuits, cherry flavored licorice, brandy poured garden, sensory overload. Extremely is a weak word to describe the envelopping sweetness. Tongue-coating honey and maple, superb complexity. Drink this at the end of a summer evening and it brings the sun right back into your house. Glorious bourbon, cognac and even more so port like finish. Eternal fruit syrup aftertaste. Delicious.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

4133,"2004-05-31",4.5,"Although I dont know too much about meads, I felt one of this magnitude was an excellent one to rate for #300. I agree with Radek this is a really good mead. And on Oakes non chugging back qualities. The first four meads, at the tasting, stumbled in as honey accented chardonnays or maybe a rose. The Jadwiga stormed in like a port. A completely different animal. It is hard to compare Jadwiga to the other meads at the tasting (none on the site at this point). It would be like going from Guinness Draft to Alesmith Speedway. Unfortunately thats how it rates. It is simply far more complex. And the style has no real gradiant between the bench-warmer and the superstar. 25 year old 18% abv. Extremely boozey, raisin, pepper, sweet, grape, salt-water toffee aroma. It smells very much like a Madiera. Bordering on cloyingly sweet, there is so much going on in the qualities of this mead. Cognac coloured with a zambucca viscosity. So much honey. Not the cheap stuff. Plum and candied everything imaginable. Scotchy warmth. Cough syrup herb medicine action. Some wheat and molases comes through. For something of such a high alcohol it is extremely smooth to the hot plummy finish. Insulin shots and pancreas exams for everyone!","Southampton, Ontario, CANADA","Crockett"

Simple at times but has enough rich depth to make it lovely. Alcohol is rediculously smooth. Richly smooth full bodied palate. Delicious stuff but got to be a bit heady by the end of an overly generous pour. 7/4+/9-10/5/16-17 Bottle shared by HogTownHarry
May 2004. Pours a brownish brandy like colour. Or at least how I picture brandy never actually having had one myself. With a swirl of the glass the pleasantly sweet aroma is overpowered by the alcohol at times. Flavour is dominated by sweetness, with hints of molasses or malt extract making an occasional appearance. Viscous and syrupy it continues to drip down the side of the glass long after it crosses your lips. Long lingering sweetness and while the alcohol is noticeable in the flavour profile, its not a bad thing. Quite nice. Thanks for sharing this one Kimchee, and for hosting this Mead tasting.

A wonderful aroma of honey, a bit of wine, and assorted fruits as well.  The taste was incredible, and not at all what was expected.  If there was 17% alcohol in here, I certainly couldnt taste it.  Sweet honey with cherries mixed in as well.  There were hints of the oak that this drink had been aged in.  A wonderful beverage all around.","Rowlett, Texas, USA","flemdawg"

I knew it was going to be a treat so I wanted to to wait for a time that I could share it with my fellow RateBeer friends.  After the Fort Wayne Ale Fest 2004, BigBadBear, Flemdawg, JSquire, Hotstuff, and Silphium came over to my place for a tasting.  This was our first brew.  And oh what a brew it was!  I carefully cut the string that went through the label so as to not damage it.  I uncapped it and poured it into snifters for each person.  Wow!  What an aroma!  It was the most complex aroma I have yet to rate.  The bottle poured no head whatsoever in my snifter (unless you count the one clear colored bubble I saw!).  The body was transparent and dark ruby red brown in color.  The aroma was simply marvelous with vinous potent plum port like notes that simply have to be smelled to appreciate.  The mouth feel was thick and chewy with a strong dark honey flavor that was smooth and thick and heavy.  Wow!  What a mead!  Like no other mead I have yet to have the pleasure of tasting.

Heavy malt and bready nose with lots of fruit notes (raisin, plum, port), with additional aroma characteristics of licorice, pepper, star anise, ginger, and cask wood; vinous indeed! This is one to sip joyfully with a taste of aged cheese. Very long ripened fruit, honey, spice, vanilla and oaky flavors. The mouthfeel is full, oily, soft, and astringent.

Nice, but a little too sticky at times. Complexly sweet and much more flavorful than I would've imagined sans hops. Alcohol was masked and melded well behind other flavors. Interesting things going on, but the heavy sweetness was a little too droning (ironically, a drone can mean a male bee that does no work ... which would take quite the contrary to make this beer ... er, I mean, mead).","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
4133,"2004-04-08",3.5,"No head (still). Body is clear dark amber. Aroma is very cognac/sherry-like: sherry, honey, caramel/molasses, 
butterscotch, orange. Flavor is heavily sweet. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, long. Full body, syrupy 
texture, flat carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Ok, point one: the finish (retronasal aroma) goes on a 
significantly long amount of time.  That's good. The aroma is strong, that's also good.  But this is not the 
end-all/be-all of mead for me. The main problem is that it's so painfully cloyingly syrupy sweet that it's 
difficult to enjoy more than a few sips. Very fatiguing.  
Decadent?  YES.  Out the wazoo.  Something I'd buy again?  Nope.  So, yes, this is very good mead, but it's 
not the end of the rainbow IMHO.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Heavy alcohol, honey, and brandy-wine fill the nostrils. Written in my notes, probably one of the most delectably sweet aromas ever. The taste is very sweet and extremely sticky as is to be expected.

In many ways this reminds me of the strong Sam Adams beers (Millenium and Utopias) in that the honey character is somewhat similar to the maple syrup character in those beers.  However, Apis Jadwiga is a much smoother drink, and the alcohol, though warming, blended nicely with the thick honey and wood flavors.  I also noted a touch of tobacco or raisin in the body.

It has a nice alcohol warmth but the alcohol flavor is very well hidden and not overpowering at all.  It is hard to rate this in respect to beer, but it is like a much better version of the DFH WWS 23% that I rated earlier.  It also reminds me of great liqueurs, such as drambuie and cherry heering, and I am really rating this mead in that respect. If I were forced to rate this as a beer and not a mead, I would take a point off for appearance (no head) and palate (a little too syrupy), but as a mead, I can't imagine it being any better.

There was always satisfaction in the silky smooth palate, the burst of fruity that so tempers the note of honey found in more common meads, and the bouquet of an aroma.  I will so miss it.  Perhaps one day Ill manage to have another bottle.  In the meantime, I may have to buy a good bottle of port to recreate some of the experience.

To be quite honest Ive never really cared that much for Meads, just way to sweet, then about 6 months a go I was introduced to a whole line of meads that just knocked my sox off. Redstone, Lednicki, and a few others, just totally turned me around in my thinking.

The color clear orange amber to copper with the aroma of sweet honey, over ripe fruit like plums and apples and a bit of alcohol to round it out, a very appealing. Taste is that of maple syrup, honey, thick and chewy, just seals itself to your palate, marvelous taste to go along with the aroma, for being 17% plus there was not much alcohol bitterness, but it does leave a nice Tummy Warming sensation. 

Meads make a great after dinner aperitif, or when you just want a little something sweet and powerful, a style I think many of us overlook, which is a shame, and a heartfelt thank you to herbjones and the ratebeerians"" for this sample.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

As I got ready to enjoy this fine mead, I wasn't sure what to expect - sure, there'd be honey, but it also seemed that I'd get a lot of alcohol, but the taste is pure sweetness, an amazing blend of honey and maple with no alcohol to be found.  The aftertaste just adds to the delighfulness of this fine mead as it's just all honey, one of my favorite foods.

The aroma was evident from over 2 feet away, sticking your nose in the glass was almost too much for me to bear. Almost cloying mixture of rum, raisins, cream, potent dark honey, a touch of cinnamon and strawberry -- blended together with a whole ton of alcohol. Heavy, sticky,glass-coating rich clear garnet hue. Rich, aged fullness evident immediately after the first sip. Alcohol well-disguised by apple blossom sweetness, vanilla, almond, and a touch of citrus. Dizzying aroma definitely more bark than bite in terms of alcohol. Just a bit of warmth in the back of the throat. Noted just a bit of dryness. Perfect palate...all flavor notes evident and lingered without overpowering sweetness. You must, must try this mead!","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
4133,"2003-10-04",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 27, 2007 Glistening clear rosy chestnut. Seeping oily drippings cling to the glass like a full-bodied wine.  Luxurious aroma of melted plums, butter, graham, wax, almond, gelatin, and solvent.  Lightly vinous with spicy alcohol notes.  The dark honey, toasted wood, and flowery tones are perfectly-placed.  Decadently soft, silky, and oily on the palate.  The pungent alcohol struggles to get past the immense complexity, thus is not even a factor.  Mesmerizingly rich flavors are fended by tangy honey and feathery floral notes.  Tingly vinous textures assault the palate with notes of sherry, melon, and slightly coarse honeyed raisins.  Solvent-like alcohol becomes more apparent toward the finish, but is suppressed by the flowery honey and toasted wood.  Addictively succulent and sappy throughout.  Not only are the honey notes flawlessly exhibited, but the flowery notes ensure the drinkabilty and the alcohol is remarkably concealed.  Only a goddess is worthy of this 25 year-old nectar.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
4133,"2003-05-20",5.0,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2003 Very nice dark amber color.No head but then maybe there not supposed to have a head.The aroma is fantastic,wine like in many respects,sweet as hell,almost a plum or possibly pruneish aroma,with a slight but very evident alcohol bite as well.Very heavy thick feel in the mouth,sweet as hell,big wine taste,the alcohol is some what hidden and what you do detect is gone shortly after you detect it.Damn i'm glad i bought this brew it.It's my first Mead but it was worth the $30/bottle and Muhahahaha to you poor souls who where unwilling to trade for such a good brew.My Grandmother used to say that age was nothing but for this Mead it is everything.It's 25 years old and doing quite well for it's age.I'm glad i have 3 more to save for later and for those of you who didn't or couldn't read in the forum,your loss.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
