372,"2016-12-29",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed at Cantillon on November 12 during the brew day. 750 mL bottle as Assemblage de lÁmitié. The pour is a hazy golden straw color with a thicker white head that roils down to a thin ring with a good bit of lace left behind. The aroma has a ton of stone fruit right up front. There is a good citrus and a ton of acidity. A wet barnyard funkiness lingers on the back end, but its pretty solid. The flavor is much of the same. There is a good bit more citrus zest to it, but the funkiness comes through a little heavier. Of the three, its definitely safe to say that the Cantillon portion holds strongest. The mouth feel is a touch heavy, but brightly carbonated with a lingeringly funky and fruity finish. This is pretty damn tasty!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
372,"2016-11-10",3.8,"Sample from a 75cl bottle shared by Franco, thanks! It pours a clean golden color with a small white head. Aroma is mostly funky and Bretty with notes of basement, mold, hay, lemon peel and light acidity. Taste is quite sharper on the acidic notes, with plenty of lemon juice and citrus flavors, light woody astringency and good barnyard funk. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, interesting to try but inferior to regular Gueuze","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"
372,"2016-05-06",4.2,"Thanks to Bill for sharing this one. Hazy golden color. Must and dry but nicely balanced.","New Jersey, USA","GrumpyOldTroll"
372,"2015-05-13",4.1,"750ml poured at Wild Friendship event. Hazy yellow golden color with a finger of gaseous foam. Aromas of musty basement funk, light stonefruit, wet wood. Palate follows with soft oak, lemon zest, hints of vanilla, unripe nectarine, straw and a lingering citrus fuzz. Dusty finish.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
372,"2015-05-13",4.1,"750ml bottle Cantillon label poured at Allagash Wild Friendship Celebration, pours hazy semi clear pale orange with small head. Nose bas musty lemon, basement, wet funk, earthy, stonefruit. Taste is soft, lemon, funky wet wood, old basement, earthy oak, barrel, light toasted wood, some stonefruit, medim tartness, minerality. Finishes tart with funky wood, lemony grain, light vanilla, oak. Understated and balanced, the Cantillon portion shines in this blend.","Hampton Roads, Virginia, USA","JBPortland"
372,"2015-05-11",4.0,"From bottle at Cantillon (thanks Bill). It pours hazy golden orange with a small white head. The nose is soft, rather woody, plenty of brett, juicy, funk, earth, floral and hay. The taste is crisp, tart, good mouth-pucker, some acidity, funk, wood, lots of brett, white wine, a decent bitter bite, mandarin and kumquat with a dry finish. Medium body and fine carbonation. A very interesting flavour profile. Some Beatification character definitely comes through. Rather enjoyable stuff.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
372,"2015-05-07",4.2,"Poured from a bottle at RR WFB event. 
Aroma is nice with a good musty, oak note but also some light tropical fruit and citrus. Good acidic character with some nice earthy funk. Some light peach and stone fruit notes as well. 
Pours a hazy golden orange with a small white head that recedes to the edges and disappears. No lacing and small legs. 
Flavor has a moderate acidity; a bit of the Cantillon sharpness but it is balanced by the softer acidity of the other beers. Nice mineral note and herbal funk with some light earthiness. Medium light tropical fruit notes and citrus. Very nice and while the Cantillon dominates, the Resurgam and Beatification does show through and soften out the Cantillon and add some fruitiness. 
Mouthfeel is medium low bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a very nice beer with a lot of character from each of the base beers. Its interesting how the microflora notes from the US beers blend and show through the microflora of the Cantillon.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
372,"2014-11-11",3.8,"Poured by Jean Van Roy at the Shelton Brothers/Sharefest Charity Event. 750ml bottle into wine glass.

Pours orange in color, white head. Nose is funky, tart, cheesy. You can definitely tell theres a mix of American Wilds & the Belgian Lambic. Flavor is more Sonambic & Lambic, less Coolship. Nice tartness, funk, oak. Body is light, finish is dry & tart.

Good, but probably my least-favorite of the tasting. Still a solid beer, regardless. I am looking forward to the Allagash version being released in the future, should be fun to compare.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"
372,"2014-11-09",4.1,"Bottles opened at the Cantillon Sharefest charity tasting, very thrilled to have an opportunity to try this. Pours a clear golden orange in color with a half fingers worth of quickly dissipating off-white head. Quite tart up front, the sonambic really makes its presence known quickly. It kinda has that one dimensional acidity that a Beatification would have. There is a lingering mustiness on the finish that lets me know the cantillon lambic is lurking in there. I dont see much of the Resurgam shining through, both the sonambic and lambic seem to be the more expressive beers. There is some stone fruit character that I would attribute most to the lambic. Light mouthfeel, gentle carbonation, and a lingering acidic finish. An exquisite beer that should be really fun to watch develop over time. I cant wait to see how the three beers integrate together.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"
372,"2014-08-14",4.1,"Bottle graciously shared with Emily and Jean at the brewery on Monday 8/11.. Delicious taste incorporating many complex wild profiles.. Dominant 1.5~ year cantillon lambi upfront, but after letting it sit I swear I could taste the 2 year old sonambic peeking through. The resurgam was subdued but had a distinct grassy earthiness that was noticeable after letting the bottle open up. Such a treat to try this alongside good company.","Massachusetts, USA","gn0sis"

372,"2014-05-06",4.1,"@ Quintessence - Orange-golden color, with a small white head. Nose is defined by Bretts, but also citrus and orange shine through, as well as wooden oak. Taste offers still a pleasant sourness, at the same time the beer doesnt lack depth, and keeps a well balanced impression. Unripe lemon and green apple, grapes, along with grassy floral notes and wood. Tartness is lower than expected, medium sharpness with only hints of vinegar, shining again in the bitter finish. Leaves some space on the palate for sweet bonbons, with ripe fruits. Ending is only a little dry, medium body.","GERMANY","aleigator"

372,"2014-05-01",3.7,"Bottle @ Quintessence 2014. Every component was 2010 vintage, not sure that young lambic was used to carbonate this?

A - Very cloudy, muted pale orange. Would have preferred to get a pour that wasnt so yeasty. sticky off-white 2 finger head fading slowly.

S - Nose was huge brett forward with a lot of orange peel, soft cheese rind, musty basement attic and lemon peel

T - Sweet bright citrus lines. Bitter sulphur copper penny overly saw grass and wild grapes. Lots of orange. Sweet candies. Pineapple. 

M - medium with a touch of dryness.

O - Really enjoyed this one but its a bit young at this point. maybe some more time and laying down will improve this to be a world class beer.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
372,"2014-05-01",4.1,"A couple of pours at Quintessence 2014. Hazy gold pour small ring of white foam. Aroma is funky, lots of oak, at first whiff I would say the American sour notes overpower the lambic. There are aromas of white wine grapes, lots of brett, oak, berries, light sourdough aromas. Taste is tart, bready, light fruity notes, I found a bit more Cantillon acidity and funk on the tongue than I did in the aroma. Palate is med-light bodied with light carbonation.

372,"2014-05-01",4.6,"Two tasting glasses @ Cantillon Quintessence 2014. All base beers 2010 Vintage. Bright orange, golden with little white head. Nose is full sweet and ripe oranges, lots of brett, light funk, intensely fruity, flowery with citrus. Taste is full of apricots, ripe fruits, very fruity for the style with lots of apricot, flowers, plenty of brett, juicy peaches, citrus sour and peel. Creamy body, brett thin and fine carbonation. I feel like Allagash Coolship dominates, the peach in here is very reminiscent to the 2011 Resurgam which I tried prior to this one. Very delicious and highly successful and surprisingly fruity, lovely beer and local in 3 different time zones. A unique blend.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

A nice brew although the brettanomyces sort of takes over a bit too much. although a nice blend of lambic and sours. even if they blended even parts its not balanced enough for me, some beers is a bit too prominent.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","Ludvig"
372,"2014-05-01",4.0,"From bottle @ Cantillon Quintessence 2014. Clear bright golden with a small bubbly off-white head and some lacing. Aroma is really oaky (theres even light buttery notes), nice lemony funk (Cantillon funk), light barnyard, citrus and grassy notes. Taste is moderately sour with an important oak presence, light funk, lemon, citrus and light grassy finish. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Dry finish, but less than ""regular"" gueuze. A lot of oak in the finish too. Balance is good. Its actually quite tasty, but it doesnt have the complexity of the best gueuze. Still a really nice sour.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

372,"2014-05-01",3.6,"Bottle sample @ Cantillon Quintessence 2014.
De couleur dorée légèrement orangée et un col léger blanc.
Arôme offre un bouquet typique de lambic avec un profil malté ressortant bien et accompagné deffluves herbacées et légèrement fruitées rappelant les agrumes. 
Palais reste sec avec un caractère grains malté fermenté, limite poussiéreux avec ce profil aigre/funk de blend. Petite note épicée renforcée par un boisé subtil.
Au final, lajout dAllagash et RR rend le mélange peut être un peu moins sec et aigre que la Gueuze Cantillon mais également un peu plus attractive au niveau gustative que dhabitude. Rien contre la Gueuze Cantillon, mais simplement mon observation lors de cette dégustation. Reste à pouvoir déguster cette Friendship Brew encore pour se faire un deuxième opinion.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
