The flavor follows with the burnt caramel and toasted bread malt sweetness along with some grains, nuts, and balancing hop bitterness on the back end. The yeast is clean and crisp and rounds things out. Medium bodied and fairly smooth with balanced carbonation that leads a to clean and slightly bitter finish.

2212,"2015-10-01",2.6,"Ballast Point is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. Up until recently, theyve seemed incapable of error. But with Dead Ringer, their entry into the Oktoberfest/Marzen style, they finally dropped the ball. When my friends and I reviewed this in a blind taste test last month it was awful. This particular bottle is much better than that one, though its still not that good. Its possible something may have happened to this beer in transit to my area, but whatever the case may be, its just a disappointing experience.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a shaker glass. It was bottled on 8/4/15 and cost $3.05 ($0.25 per ounce).

Appearance: Pretty copper/mahogany hue; fairly clear with some carbonation visible. Pours to a small, off-white, soapy head which nearly completely dissipates and leaves no lacing.

Smell: Fairly typical dark lager aroma, but a strong presence of something off. A bit of a cranberry scented candle (and I dont mean that as a compliment). More mild than bad, but far from good.

Taste: Going into this beer, I prepared for the worst and hoped for the best. Its strange when you review a beer you had a bad experience with. I was hoping it was just the bottle last time, but it doesnt appear to have been an isolated incident. Theres definitely a familiar Marzen character here with the presence of slightly sweet darker malt and just a hint of fruity flavor (maybe some toffee, too). Unfortunately, its completely obscured by a sour tanginess to the palette. Much like the nose, theres a presence akin to cranberry in here: tart and a little astringent. No hop character that I can detect. The flavor seems to worsen as it warms. I dont know what the deal is with this beer, but I do not like it.

Drinkability: It always surprises me when a bad beer is nominally high in alcohol. Ballast Point Dead Ringer is 6% ABV, which isnt unusual for the style. That being said, it does not deliver what I expect in a beer with that potency. The mouthfeel is tepid, a bit oily, and a little warming. It finishes clean, but it is not refreshing at all. Theres no challenge to drink this, but theres no enjoyment, either.

2212,"2015-10-01",4.8,"Having lived in Germany, I learned quickly to appreciate Marzens. Ballast Points Dead Ringer is as close as I have come to a real German Style Marzen which become so plentiful in Deutschland this time of year. Sure it is no Vetter (should you ever find your self in Heidelberg, Vetter is easily found in the Altstadt).But, for an American Ocktoberfest, Dead Ringer hands down blows away every other one I have tried this year. I wish I could describe it in the terms normally associated with beer, yet after each sip I find myself back on the banks of the Neckar in a dream state I never wish to leave.

Theres a bit of a bite from the alcohol which probably only seems that way due to the lower bitterness of the beer.

Medium body with a creamy texture. Perfect carbonation with a nice effervescent burst in the middle and a rollicking finely bubbled prickly finish.

The flavor profile is unusual for a marzen. It is more intense and has a bit more toasted grain huskiness and hops than you usually encounter.

This was one of the worst of over thirty Oktoberfests we tried. Its got loads of acetone, apples and stressed yeast weirdness in the nose--almost malt liquor-y.  It tastes decent considering, malty and a bit on the sweet side. I think of Ballast Point as being typically a good technical brewery but this is all kinds of wrong. 

Original (2.7):This one is close but its not quite on point. Its headless and cloudy brown. Its nose initially seems to have a fresh caramel malt thing going on but the sweetness when you taste it seems to bring out some cooked veggie weirdness and that brings things down a notch. This is full bodied and just a bit syrupy w/ prickly carbonation. My initial impression of this was quite favorable but as I dig in Im just finding more I dont like.

I am reluctant to post this review, because I am not wont to issue overly negative responses, especially when it comes to a brewery like Ballast Point which I greatly admire, and Im willing to accept that I may have received a bad bottle. However, I drew my sample from some cases that I just received in my store this week. With that stipulation, I have to say in all honesty that this is a terrible beer, having no discernable relationship to traditional German Oktoberfest marzens. My negative reaction starts with the off-putting aroma of caramelized plastic. The unpleasantness continues on the palate with astringently bitter caramelized malt flavors that persist on the finish. There is no rounded breadiness that one expects from the style. At the risk of being redundant, this beer is an unpleasant drinking experience and very disappointing, considering the source. As I said, I will be happy to be contradicted and told that I simply have received a bad bottle. I hope that is the case.","Decatur, USA","brewscruiser"

 Appearance  The beer pours a very deep copper color with a one finger head of a tan colored foam. The head fades relatively quickly leaving a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is heaviest of a sweeter smell of caramel and toffee with some nice big aromas of a roasted malt smell. Along with these smells comes some smells of some light spice of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice with a little bit of dark fruit and nut.

 Taste  The taste begins with a caramel and toffee sweetened flavor with a big presence of a roasted malt taste. Along with these tastes are some toast and a decent spice flavor of nutmeg and allspice. A little bit of apple, comes soon after the initial tastes, with it only fading later as the taste advances. The spice seems to, all the while, get stronger, while the roastedness remains constant throughout. More spice and a little bit of graininess and a slight bit more toffee and caramel come at the very end, leaving a rather highly spiced and somewhat harsher roasted flavor to linger on the tongue.


 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side. For the style the two are rather appropriate, but overall the feel is nothing all that special.

 Overall  A decent Oktoberfest, but a little too spicy for my taste. If looking for something with a nice roast and spice flavor then this is a good one, but if looking for something with a bit more smoothness, then this may not be your first choice.","","Darkmagus82"
