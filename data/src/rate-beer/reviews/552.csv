552,"2017-05-07",4.2,"Clean aroma with fresh citrus in the beginning and a subtle caramel-malty end, also hints of yeast. The color is dark brown (cloudy) with resemblance to melted sugar, and the ale has a big frothing creamy top. The aroma is clear, but without a relatively short finish.

The taste is prominently sweet (medium) and malty through the beginning with a clear bitter (medium), but with a crisp freshness to it throughout. 

Not the heaviest of ales, but certainly not light either as it feels nice and fatty in the mouth. A lively ale which might help the freshness come through. 

The only negative thing I could find with this beer was the color being a little cloudy, which I personally isnt a big fan of. Despite being a fairly heavy ale it was almost as drinkable as a light lager, which was surprising considering its sweetness. The tastes were clear and pleasant, but with more complexity to it if you are in mood for some searching. No wonder people join monasteries!","Drammen, NORWAY","brewberg"

Bugger to get the corked out but presented with a gorgeous looking beer - deep ruby body, small but dense beige head persists.
Aroma subtle but intriguing - dried fruit notes of date, sultana, prune, vinous red fruits, honey & caramelised sugar/fruit.
A sultry silky smooth ride on the palate - soft fine carbonation, texture is velvety, perhaps lost a bit of weight with age but ethereally light, tremendous balance.
Palate is just sensational for an aged beer - starts sweet with those caramelised malts, good weight upfront then slims down with stacks of sultana & date and porty nutty rancio notes on a long spicy yet supremely well balanced finish.

With a clickerty clack I swizzle my BBbarfly bottle opener into action and as the top pops there's a momentary fine mist. Already a hint of what is to come the malty fragrance begins its charm. As I pour the hissing fluid a foamy one finger white head forms and is soon spent and settles to a gossamer layer. I hold it to the light and inspect it's hazy mahogany hue that has the look of a quality merlot. 

Gently swirling the goblet I further release the redolent richness. There is nothing overpowering, the complex aromas need time to flood the nose... mmmm malty sweet fruits hints of raisins, cherries bread yeast and is that alcohol or spice?

Imbibing the libation brings your attention to its medium body and with just enough carbonation to send the feel and flavours of the warming fluid around the mouth. Yes! Cherish that cherry note, revel in the raisins and mellow maltiness. The follow through gives a hint of herbs and slight tingling on the tongue.

552,"2016-06-29",4.4,"Large bottle served in a chalice. (From Nov. 2011 notes)

My favorite Belgian, as of a few years ago, but never rated and not sampled for some years. 

Pours a hazy reddish-brown with a grand, creamy tan head that reduces to a durable top coat. Full lacing washes down the side of the glass with every sip. The head, at least, deserves a 5. 

Plenty of fruity yeast in the nose, with some sweet malt, a hint of tartness, and light notes of cloves and dark fruits. 

T: a tart and fruity dubbel, featuring fig and apricot notes, with a fine balance of sweet, sour and light bitter. Some mild alcohol esters complement rather than detract from the flavor. Hard to criticize, but perhaps a tad more yeasty and earthy than ideal in the finish -- or this can be part of its charm. Improved with some warming.

Id almost compare it to newcastle brown, with caramel and raisin flavors. Below that I got some basement/musty and hint of dried cherry flavor. My bottle gushed slightly when opened. Color was medium amber with slight hazyness. Very smooth drinking, no hint of excess alcohol flavor.","","kingofthemtn"

W smaku dosyć słodkie, co ciekawe lekkie. Wyraźnie fenolowe z bardzo intensywną gumą balonową i goździkowym posmakiem. Lekki alkohol w smaku jest wyczuwalny, ale jest szlachetny.

It poured a very hazy brown colour with a very nice thick cream coloured two finger head that dissipates very slowly but when it does, leaves a nice curtain lacing. Aromas are fruity, mainly of dark fruits like plum, cherry, and fig. There is also some pear, apple and candied sugar and a hint of nuttiness. Fruity cherry and plum tastes upfront with hints of banana and pear. Theres also some light malt caramel and bready sweetness followed by a nice light bitter finish. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth creamy and slightly sticky. Admittedly, I used to think that this was just ok but Ive grown to enjoy this beer the more I drink it.

552,"2015-05-02",3.9,"330 ml bottle from Sobeys Liquor, served in a tulip glass. Chimay is the one name that comes up most often when you mention Trappist ale, or so it seems. Pours a nearly opaque pumpkin-orangey brown, with a couple of visible, fine streaks of carbonation and a milky head that goes from creamy to pearly and leaves spots of lace in its wake. Aroma delivers a payload of bready malt with hints of caramel, while the hops bring deep red, winey fruits and an undercurrent of dusty herbalness. Flavor is gentle overall, focusing on its fruity, grapey, lightly sweet, vinous character on top of its toasted malts, with a touch of carbonic bite and alcohol warmth. A bit chewy with a slightly lingering finish. Subtly flavorful when it comes to its winey facets, never entering a distasteful malt liquor territory. Still, this beer puzzles me. I had expected explosions of thick malt and flurries of hops akin to Duvel Tripel Hop, but it was all a restrained, yet likeable, knock on the doors of my tastebuds. Puzzling.","Medicine Hat, Alberta, CANADA","BeerAndPonies"

The beer has a surprisingly raspy effervescent and lively carbonation dancing on your palate while digging in its sharp heels. The flavor is chewy bready malts, sweet stone fruits, some wine like booziness plus a bit of nuttiness and some spice. A complex yet delicately balanced brew, theres a reason these guys have been around for ages.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"

552,"2014-12-30",3.4,"11.2 oz bottle into a Chimay goblet, natch. 

A: Pours a murky dark brown color. The head is about a finger high, with a cream shade - it doesnt have good retention at first, but seems to last a while after fading to a thin film. A little bit of lacing is left behind. 

S: There are lots of apple notes from the esters that really mesh well with the strong caramel and brown sugar aromas. There are even slight hints of chocolate and cherry. So, the aroma is three parts caramel-coated apples and one part chocolate-coated cherries. How is that not awesome?? 

T: Didnt live up to the aroma, sadly. Apple esters hit the palate immediately and end up as the primary note over the secondary caramel and brown sugar flavors. The balance between these two notes is bang-on; its the lack of the depth (and the unwanted metallic notes) that kill its chance at greatness. Still, this is enjoyable enough. 

M: Very fizzy, as expected. The fizz bothers me here a bit more than it did in Chimay Blue, simply because this doesnt have the full body to help mask it slightly. But its as bone dry as can be, and that gives it rock-solid drinkability. 

O: As a straight-up dubbel/BSDA, it doesnt hit me the same way Rochefort 8 did. Its far from bad, dont get me wrong, but Im kind of nonplussed here. This is probably on the lower end of quality in terms of trappist ales.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

552,"2014-09-19",4.3,"Transfer from BA review on 8-3-1-3-

 Poured from bottle into a Chimay chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a hazy copper-garnet color with a small tan colored head. The head fades rather fast leaving only a trace level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is fruity with nice smells of darker fruits. The fruits are mainly of a resin, plum and prune. Mixed with the darker fruit smells are some nice yeasty smells as well as some spice aromas. Rounding out the aroma is wheat bread and a banana smell giving it an overall dark Belgian aroma overall.

 Taste  The taste begins with darker fruit and a slightly biscuit flavor. The darker fruit are just as would have been expected from the nose being mostly of raisin and plum. Right up front there is a moderately spicy taste of nutmeg, clove and cinnamon which is quickly meet with some caramel and banana sweetness. Toward the middle some yeasty taste begin coming to the tongue while some of the biscuit disappearing. Toward the end, a tiny bit of alcohol comes to the tongue as well as a moderately strong molasses sweetness which when combined with all the rest, leaves a nice somewhat sweeter and warming taste to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is medium in its thickness and creaminess with lots of carbonation bubbles filling the body of the brew. The moderate body and carbonation make for a more crisp feel balancing out the sweetness of darker fruits and sugary tastes well. 

 Overall  Fantastically tasty and quite a pleasant drinking brew. This is renowned for a reason.","","Darkmagus82"

Mahogni-farvet med rødbrune nuancer og ufiltreret Trappist kloster Ale med 4 cm tykt offwhite-farvet skum med store bobler, som mindskes til ca. 1 cm. 
Aroma i næsen er typisk belgisk: tørret frugt og gær. Rosin, sveske. 
Denne øl virker en anelse mindre sød end de øvrige Chimay's. Omend lidt sødme kommer snigende gennem smagsbilledet. Samtidig virker den umiddelbart som den ""svageste"" i flokken af brødre og søstre. Mere vandet end de øvrige. 
Smagen er mere maltet og humlet end de øvrige, hvilket kan falde i nogle's smag. Og eftersmagen er en anelse mere bitter end gennem selve smagen. 
Som øvrige Chimay's er der skruet godt op for kuldioxid-indholdet, hvorfor jeg altid fristes af at køre øllet et par gange rundt i glasset for at få det til at bruse af.

Taste is actually much more delicate: malts, nuts, cake, caramel and a touch of alcohol and a little sourness too. Actually what I probably like best about this beer its the finish: balanced, with perfect sweetnes and that smaaall hint of hops; nice medium/low carbonation.

Its a very cloudy (foggy might be a better term) rusty orange liquid topped by an huge, thick, fluffy, off-white head that retains quite nicely. A medium sweetness balanced by a light / medium-light bitterness and light, pleasing sour hit the tongue with an umami quality to it.

552,"2013-12-25",3.9,"Review from notes on 05/27/10
Poured from bottle to New Belgium tulip.

Pours a foggy brown. Many ribbons accumulate into a small, thin top layer of silken tan foam. The nose on this screams classic dubbel. Nice marzipan, roasty, light molasses. This ale is complex with hints of marzipan, apple and burnt caramel on the tongue. The beer is light enough in carbonation to remain light on the tongue, but sediment leaves tongue remaining grainy. Overall, this beer is very drinkable and should be sampled by anybody who enjoys belgians, or is just wanting something new and dependable.

Der Antrunk ist vollmundig mit cremigem Schaum. Insgesamt finde ich das Bier aber etwas Aromenschwach. Es ist zwar sehr schön vollmundig-cremig, aber mir fehlt die Aromentiefe etwas. Der Hauptteil ist mild-fuchtig-süffig mit Anklänge an Bananen oder Pfirsiche, aber im Nachgeschmack bleibt fast exakt der selbe mild-hefige Eindruck auf der Zunge - vielleicht noch zusammen mit einer leichten Süße.

552,"2013-12-19",4.4,"The very first thing I notice was the colour, I have never in my life seen such a beautiful beer, the russet brown liquid seemed to glow from within with it own luminesance and it is capped with the most wonderful head of foam. The aromatics were a wonderful restrained mixture of black currents, malts and spicy yeast. It is a medium bodied beer with nice carbonation, but what makes this beer stand out for me was the flavour balance, you can really tell that the monks have had centuries to perfect this beer. The flavours are exactly what the aroma suggest with malts and dark dried fruits making sweet love on the tongue at the start and moving to a beautiful climax of well balanced bitterness and spicy yeast.","","crippledbrewer"

Scent is... not much of anything, really. Hmm. Yeasty, bready, thats about it. I wonder if maybe this bottle went wild, as it were. Given the nature of the Chimay method, I would not be surprised. Still, In for a penny, in for a pound. The taste is quite mellow, in a rich kind of way; the mouthfeel has that luxurious rich feeling without being cloying or overbearing. Flavours of hay and wheat, ripe fruit, late summer days. Finishes on the light side, which makes me frown, but then again, this is the Red and not the Bleue that I am used to.

552,"2013-06-21",4.5,"I broke out a 750ml bottle from my cellar and poured it into the official Chimay chalice. The cork indicates it was bottled in December of 2009. 

Appearance: Beautiful red hue, though seemingly light brown. Hazy but carbonation can be seen. Forms a small, white, soapy head which mostly dissipates and doesnt lace the glass. 

Smell: Noticeably vinous aroma plus some dark fruit and a hint of confectionery sweetness.

Taste: I havent had this beer since, ironically enough, 2009. Back then it seemed like carbonated red wine to me. Four years later it drinks like a true Trappist dubbel. Actually, its almost quad-like in its complexity and robustness. When it was fresh it was quite vinous and fruity, but with three years under its belt its become remarkably sweet. Lots of confectionery flavors, but retains the classic Trappist core to keep it quite familiar. 

The palette is confectionery in its introduction: sweet (but not cloying) flavors of chocolate, toffee and caramel - almost like a liquid candy bar. Some dry bitterness through the middle - not too intense, but bitter enough to notice and to transition to the fruit-like finish. I get hints of dry red wine, fig, prunes and plums on the back end. Not quite as robust and delectable as a vintage Chimay Blue, but this vintage Chimay Red is so much more refined coming out of the basement. 

Drinkability: When you drink a Chimay 750ml bottle fresh its quite spastic and energetic across the tongue and down the throat. With 3.5 years of waiting, Chimay Red has calmed down to an extent. The mouthfeel is noticeably calm, neither thick nor thin, but still effervescent enough that carbonation sticks in the throat a bit. It leaves a slightly yeasty aftertaste, though its easily tolerable. At only 7% ABV, Chimay Red was never all that big of a beer to begin with and after time the alcohol has virtually disappeared. It does not feel or drink like a heavy beer at all and there is no heat or warmth whatsoever.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

A - Poured into a Chimay goblet. Murky chestnut brown, nice head off the top but fades into a few islands of active bubbles, that stay until the end. Almost no lacing.

S - Sweet Belgian yeast, loads of fruit, honey, alcohol vapors, toasted brown sugar, spicy nutmeg.

T - Sweet malt, roasted fig, plums, cherry, caramel, the spice really comes out as it warms. Mouthfull is very nice. Medium to full body. No stickiness.

This is a solid Dubbel. Always a good choice for the style. For whatever reason the Chimay name seemes to be a more recognized Belgian beer than other ones in its class. It deserves it.

Dont drink this cold! It provides little taste or smell while cold. This beer as most should sit and warm to fully smell, taste, and sense everything thats going on.

552,"2012-11-29",3.3,"I cant understand the renown of this beer (not Chimay, but Chimay Rouge). Its very correct in all aspects, the look is perfect and the aromas are very well integrated. But the mouthfeel is too light, watery and, in my opinion, very bland for its style. Biscuit, malts, caramel, even species, but all so tiny, with such short development, that I think that is one of the most flat beers in its style. Maybe the problem is mine...","","Temptation"

I love this one!
After rating combined this beer with Chimay cheese a la biere, a cheese that  has a fruity taste with a light bitter finish. The combination reduced the bitterness in both the cheese and the beer, making the cheese softer and more fruity and the beer more fruity and sweeter. A nice variation, but the complexity is reduced, which is a bit a pity.

Die 0,75 L Flasche mit Schampuskorken geöffnet und munter eingeschenkt. Viel Schaum aufgrund ordentlicher Kohlensäure-Perlung. Im Glas dunkel und reichlich trübe. Das Aroma empfinde ich als gelungen. Malzige Süße mit Hefe und eine würzige Fruchtigkeit. Erinnert an ein Hefe-Weißbier, nur vergleichsweise herberer Einschlag. Der Geschmack ist leider nicht so ausgeprägt wie das Aroma erwarten läßt. Neben den Frucht-, Hefenoten auch herbere Kakaonoten. Im Abgang ist aber nur noch eine alkoholische Note. Interessantes Bier, aber nicht überragend. Vielleicht hätte ich es auch nicht so gekühlt servieren sollen. Daher wird dieses Bierchen demnächst einer B-Probe unterzogen ;)

S-- Plum, apricot, spice and bread. Very rich hearty smell and also earthy as well. Just a touch of alcohol in this but it is soft and accentuates the fruit and spice even more.

T-- Hearty and a bit chewy. Big apricot and plum taste. Very stone fruit. Bread is there but it is a big hearty bread taste not the biscuit taste as more common. 

M-- Pretty thick and chewy. Little carbonation and as said a very earthy taste and feel in mouth. Spice driven, not sugar driven. A little tartness in this also.

Best before 1997 (vintage 1994)

Its always fun to try old vintage beers. I thought this one mellowed out quite nicely and held up like a champ.

A: Very hazy, dark brown hue with a small head that generates a smattering of lacing on the glass. The beer also contains some black sediment, randomly floating in slow motion throughout the liquid. It is almost two decades old, so one cant judge the appearance two harshly.

S: Belgian yeast and malt. The aroma smells like a quadrupel more than a dubbel. Its already quite evident that 16 years of age has had a profound effect on this trappist ale.

T: Malty and yeasty, this old Chimay dubbel tastes like a lighter version of a quadrupel. The beer is incredibly tame and mellow, with a really enticing Belgian yeast component.

M: Low carbonation level, certainly attributed to its old age. The feel was thin to medium bodied, with alcohol flavors non-existent.

D: A really fun experience. It makes me want to buy a few cases of Chimay and tuck them away in the back of the cellar.

Serving type: bottle

les trappistes, puisque certains brassins sont vraiment à diffusion limitée.
La Chimay rouge est la première de la série, et la moins forte, tout au moins 
parmi celles du commerce, puique Chimay a aussi sa bière « confidentielle »
sous la forme dune bière diffusée à lauberge de Poteaupré près de labbaye,
et qui titre seulement à 4,8 abv.
Bref, la Première porte son nom, mais pas pour tout le monde !!! (Double jeu
de mots, maître Capello).
Cette Rouge (cest son autre nom) est néanmoins un emblème de la trappe
en Belgique, parce que chacun a son avis tranché sur cette double, qui a
ses fervents partisans et ses amateurs éclairés.
Mon exemplaire daujourdhui est à date limite en fin 2011, ce qui est mieux 
que les bières plus jeunes. Pour les double, nhésitons pas à favoriser lâge.
Dailleurs jai dégusté hier une qui était pour fin 2013 et il est évident que celle
daujourdhui est meilleure.
La couleur est un brun châtaigne un peu particulier mais qui a son charme.
La mousse est beige, pas très stable, mais elle accroche bien les parois.
Lodeur est celle dun bon vrai brassin, avec des prunes et fruits mûrs.
Le 1er goût est de prune, poire bien mûre, et céréales torréfiées (sans doute
les extraits de malt, puisque lessentiel est un orge de Champagne).
Seul petit bémol, cette première gorgée tombe un peu « raide » en finale de
bouche, je soupçonne fort le houblon Galena den être responsable, puisque
cest un bitter.
Le 2ème goût est de pruneau, girofle et noisettes grillées.
Le 3ème passe à léquilibre entre céréales, houblon et surtout la levure qui
pointe ici le bout de son nez. Cest une jolie levure, bien lisse à la bouche.
Lalcool est bien dosé et progressif, sans envahir le sujet.
La finale est soyeuse, bien agréable, avec un panel de senteurs et saveurs,
qui vous font parcourir les sous-bois, les campagnes, et les champs, sans

Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.

In my old griefs, and with my childhoods faith.

Apricot in colour at clearest areas of opaqueness around edge and thick chestnut brown solid in centre. 2"" thick soapy tan head full of bubbles settles into a mirangue then slight ring of bubbles in minutes. Lacing is a desperate clinging of carbonation. First taste is caramel and apricot sweetness followed by a sour granny smith bite and alcohol metallic finish. A little harsh at first.

552,"2012-03-12",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/9/2011.  Poured from a 330 mL bottle into a Chimay chalice at Firkin.

The pour is a caramel brown color with a general opaque nature and a medium sized tan head.

Mostly smooth caramel malt in the nose, with some soft orchard and dark fruits, and some Belgian spice.

The taste flows well from the nose. Caramel malt, cherry, plum, a bit of raisin and red grape notes go along with a nuanced Belgian spice. The finish is still sweet, but not as much as the start of the sip.

The nose is most sweet bready malts with some floral hops. Not nearly as impressive as the aroma of white. Pours a deep hazy copper with a thick head with mild visible carbonation. Creamy lacing on the glass. Sweet bready malts, something along the lines of a biscuit with honey. Some mineral water flavors in the aftertaste. My description doesnt fit the complexity. Very light hops, with slight bitterness. Astringent and spicy alcoholic finish. Surprisingly thin and light  considering my impression from the head and lacing.

552,"2012-01-06",4.0,"Bottle (330ml):
There is a strong smell of dried fruits from this beer, dark summery fruit and berries in particular along with a touch of alcohol and grain owing to the strong alcohol content. There is also a strong malt aroma and a faint touch of caramel on the nose along with some good spicy notes right at the end.

Dark, orangey brown colour when poured and forms a thick looking, three-finger sized head that is off-white and foamy. The head roughly halves in size over the course of about a minute then holds at around a finger width tall for the remainder of the drinks life.

Sweet tasting with a lot of dried fruit to begin with in the taste and perhaps a bit of apple too. There is a lot of brown sugar like flavouring and a little bit of the roasted malts from the nose as well along with touches of alcohol. Its is a pretty solid effort from this beer.

Huge carbonation in this beer, a lot more than I had been expecting but that is not to say it was overly carbonated because it seemed to work for this particular beer. It was pretty smooth, with a medium body and great drink-ability; overall an nice beer on the palate.

A very good beer overall and one that I really enjoyed, it has most things going for it and not a lot holding it back. It may not be as good as Chimay Bleue but it was still a very good beer indeed.

552,"2011-10-28",4.0,"I kept this magnum bottle at room temperature because I wanted to drink the beer at a slightly higher temperature  expecting a deeper and more complex taste. There is a lot of pressure when I remove the cork, the beer tries to find its way out immediatly.

Colour: Chimay Première leaves a reddish brown beer in the glass, slightly hazy with not much carbonation. The creamy head is thick and beige. It leaves a nice lacing on the glass when dissapearing very slowly.

Aroma: very sweet smell with a malty undertone and a spicy touch of pepper. A very inviting and intense smell.

Taste: Chimay Première is a very drinkable beer with an ABV of only 7%. At first, the taste seems relatively simple, dominated by malts and hop bitterness. When taking a few more sips however, the beer becomes complex of taste and very well balanced with a warming alcohol presence. The full body is combined with a fresh crispness. The mouthfeel is a bit like syrup and sticky. The dry finish makes you longing for more instantly.

Aroma: The nose is fairly sweet, with caramel malts, some dark fruits, Belgian yeast, and spice

Flavor: The taste is medium sweet, with a Belgian yeast, roasted caramel malts, and some fruity notes

Palate: The body is medium-full with a creamy and chewy mouthfeel, and soft-to-average carbonation

Overall Impression: 
Its fairly surprising to see that I got all the way to rating 1885 before entering one for Chimay Red, but somehow I managed.  I like this beer, but I dont really tend to order/buy it very often for some reason, but when I walked into Costco and saw this 3 pack (Red, White, and Blue) + a glass offering for like $12 I couldnt resist.  Thats a heck of a deal!  So, I, of course, enjoyed this one in my new Chimay glass.  This one is so easy to find, that it probably doesnt the respect it deserves, but it is a really good beer.  I wont hold its accessability against it, if anything, that should be a plus, becuase they make so much of it and they still make it so well.  It is about time that I got around to inputing a rating for this one, and I look forward to getting new/updated versions of the other two up here soon.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

It pours a murky brown liquid with some amber tones (and some ruby as it evolves) and many little yeast spots, with a gigantic consistent and pillowy beige head (tainted brown by a nice yeast sediment) that lasts beautifully throughout the beer and leaves some good lacing. The aroma is mostly malty, with caramel, brown sugar, some hints of banana and a slight citrusy hoppiness. There is also a good deal of roastiness and bready yeasts. It tastes kind of likewise, but intenser and more complex, some dried fruits suddenly appearing as well as a faint brandy-like touch. A nice spiciness is also there. It is medium sweet, a little sour and has a pleasant notable bitterness. In the mouth it feels thick and mildly carbonated, with little bubbles coming alive inside the mouth, very slightly prickling the tongue. The body is medium, giving the brew more drinkability. It finishes rather dry and bitter, with a sweet caramelly and nutty finish along with some floral and citrusy hoppiness. The presentation is smart and very trappist-like. I love it; cant help it.

Poured into goblet trappist glass, some descent lacing diminishes; descent dark-mahogany appearance. Some deep reds in this for sure. 

Aroma is spices; toffee, caramel, tingling yeast - quite douughey, taste is alcohol, clove, dried figs, raisins, caramel, some soy source, a distinctly raw texture-generally a very complicated brew, ages well though. Its low ibu and can be put down for a long time. 

Over aging the caramel evolves and becomes thicker and the texture becomes more sherry like, the booze is heavy and the candy sugar roles off the tongue.

330 ml into Chimay chalice. BB says 2013.
The pouring results in long-lived light tan head atop of hazy coppery fluid with reddish depth. Head slowly dies out until a thin soapy film is all what is left. Malty (not sweet!) aroma, unburnt toast, raisins, hint of plum and perfumy almost rose-like alcohol.The flavor profile is malty although far less sweet than expected - more alike of bitter caramel, with raisins, toasty bread crust bitterness and soft alcohol leading into dry finish. As with Chimay White the individual characteristics are somehow indecisive and I cant easily pinpoint at any although they are clearly delimited. However, the beer is very well balanced and refined with individual flavors/aromas in tune with each other. Medium bodied, medium carbonated. This dubbel is not nearly as fruity as that of Achel or Westmalle but it was the red friar that once introduced me into Trappist ale world and ignited my curiosity about other monastic brews, so Chimay Red , I owe you so much.","SLOVENIA","EvilBuddha"

A - Lighter, honey chestnut brown with some orangish hues. Fairly large, foamy, bubbly white head with average retention and a nice thin bubbly layer of lace.

S - Strong caramel and bready malt aroma. With a sweet toasted aroma and some nuttiness. Some light aroma of raisin and plum. Some spiced aroma is present too with cinnamon, some clove, and other spices. This is a bit lighter than what I expected, but it is nice none the less. A sweet, dark, toasted bread aroma.

T - Similar to the nose. A sweet, dark bready malt taste provides for the base and a lot of the flavor. Mid sip to the finish some fruitiness comes out with raisin and plum being the strongest with it being on the lighter side of a dark fruit flavor. Some spice, cinnamon and clove, along with a hint of bubblegum also come out. Like the aroma, it reminded me of a sweet dark bread with some pieces of fruit in it.

M - On the lighter side of medium body with average carbonation. A little watery, especially for the style, but pretty smooth.

D - Fairly complex and well balanced, but has a subtlety for the style in that it isnt overly powerful. All this makes for a pretty easy to drink beer. The flavor is good, but not strong or overpowering on the palate.

Notes: Vintage 2009. This was a bit lighter and subtler Dubbel. The flavors were enjoyable even though it didnt taste like other Dubbels I have had.

Im drinking it from a large win glass, since thats the closest thing I have to a trappist glass. This is also my first trappist beer.

Its pretty much like the newer one in most aspects, but seems a bit more balanced to me. Its got a tiny sting to it, and and overall better balance between bitter and sweet.

552,"2010-03-29",3.9,"When aging beer, there is always a little bit of Russian roulette involved. While there are certain standards and guidelines to assist one on their path of building a beer cellar, risk is always an enjoyable factor; the mystery and challenge of aging a beer to its peak of supping perfection. The reward is beyond words and the thrill is one of lifes best. Chimay is a premier Trappist brewery in Belgium, offering 3 sublime beers to the unworthy masses. First and foremost is their Premier, or Red, as it is sometimes referred to. Chimay themselves recommend enjoy Premier as fresh as possible; within a year, so it was a delightful surprise when popping the cork on my bottle at home to discover I was about to indulge on a vintage 2007 bottle. Glory days are here again.


Hazy ruby and blood-orange depths fill my glass thick and full. A bit hazier than usual, an attribute I would pin on her age. A gentle khaki head settles slowly into a puffy layer of foam which makes way for a succulent nose of sweet honey-glazed dessert breads soaked in rum and brandy. Plums, black grapes, red pears, red licorice, red apples, and ripe apricots bring a cornucopia of tropical and succulent fall fruits to life. Cinnamon sticks sprinkle spice unto her fruity bouquet while candied fruits and apple juice mingle atop moist rye bread and fruitcake. Her nose lacks a crisp bite but more than makes up for it in softness which has melded together in exquisite ripeness. Sufficiently impressed with her nose, those hazy luscious depths are calling my name; naturally I answer. Sweet, bready, rummy, fruity, spiced, and just darn tasty. Slightly mouthcoating, honey and maple esters stick to my lips and sides of cheeks while I bite into red apples, pears, plums, black grapes, and apricots, their skins bursting with a crunch, juices trailing down the sides of my mouth. Smackerific. Cinnamon sticks and rum soaked rye breads mingle together in each meaty quaff while the middle of her palate slowly dries mine. Not overly dry; just enough to induce my thirst and encourage further quaffing indulgence. Dry wood tickles the back of my throat while cinnamon, rum, and brandy spice my breath and warm my chest. Melting in her boozy warmth are all her juicy meaty fruity delights. Exquisitely rich, sweet, fruity, warm, and ending with a dry spiced flourish; I must say I enjoy her with some age a bit more than fresh, though for a totally different set of reasons.


Chimay never fails to please and sometimes even surprise. While I wouldnt age the Premier as long as I would their Grand Reserve, by all means bring home a few bottles. Enjoy one fresh, but then save the others for later supping in whatever randomly timed intervals you so please.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Smell is of caramel, red wine grapes and apricot.   Mouthfeel is medium to thick but somewhat light and smooth as well.  Probably from the dryness of the yeast.  Taste is very winey and yeasty.

552,"2010-02-26",3.8,"Although not quite as heavy as its cousins, Chimay Blanche and Bleu, the Rouge is a very tasty abbey dubbel. Like most dubbels, its malty and full-bodied, but unlike most of them it has a particularly yeasty flavor. Taste is of brown sugar, as brown as the brew itself when it hits the glass. A moderate, off-white topping gives of a faint scent of clove. This is a very nice beer; light enough to go with most foods or to be drunk rather easily, beefy enough to weigh in with the pros.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

552,"2010-02-15",4.0,"750 mL bottle pours murky mahogany with a nice, fizzy, khaki head.  Carbonation seems really active, but the head doesnt last; nice lacing.  Sweet, malty aroma with raisins taking the forefront; dates, red apples, pear, red grapes, slight spice.  Very similar in the taste: apples and grapes make up the primary flavor for me.  Bready malts are evident with clove and other spices coming through.  Finishes with brown sugar, spice, and a slight boozy touch.  Medium bodied with a frothy mouthfeel and a medium level of carbonation.  Despite being a bit thin, I feel the rating is appropriate mostly in part to its impeccable balance.  The tastes all compliment each other very well with nothing standing out too much or too little.  This leads to a very easy to drink, great brew.","Idaho, USA","TLNash886"

Taste is heavy sweet, some mild bitterness makes a brief appearance then the sweetness dominates again with a long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily almost syrupy, carbonation is mostly lively leaving a tingly tongue, pleasant warming alcoholic finish.

The flavor is at first almost like a candied sweetness, but this is fleeting and the beer presents its self with a much drier spicier flavor. This beer has the fruitiness the caramel and the nuttiness that you would come to expect from a good dubbel. However it possesses a quality that continuously mystifies me, there is a defined mineral character to this beer. The earthy Mineral like character was one of the first real flavors that I identified in a beer years ago and its been a real love hate thing ever since, but the mineral qualities in this beer only add to the depth and complexity of this ale and I dare say this for me sets this beer apart from many in its style. There are also those plum raisin and fig characteristics in the flavor that showed up in the aroma.

552,"2009-11-28",3.7,"Vintage 2008. Serving date: 2009-01-21. Served in snifter.

330 ml bottle with freshness date (Best before end of 2012) and recommended serving temperature, glassware and cellaring procedure on the label.

Dark copper color with a 2,5 cm brown-shaded and sparkling head that dissipates rather fast and leaves some small lacings.

A general sweet and fruity smell (kind of like ripe apricots), soft chocolate nougat and notes or grass sits firmly on a backbone of yeast and spices.

At first, sweet malts, fruits and bread hits the taste buds. Then, a mild yeast note and a distinct spicy flavor - primarily cloves - takes over for a while before the finish. Its just slightly vinous. The finish is characterized by a gentle bitterness, even more gentle tartness and spices. Towards the end, it develops a nice caramel flavor.

Medium body, nice and lively carbonation. Very nice mouthfeel.

A very well-composed beer with interesting, pleasant and sometimes subtle notes to be discovered.

Big caramel notes on the forefront. Deep, dark fruits that are just a day away from being overripe. Nice, rich malt profile. Nice yeasty quality.

Taste is pretty light, compared to the nose. Nice malty presence, though really not very sweet. Quite earthy and yeasty, actually. Possibly over-carbonated, IMO.

Mouthfeel is creamy enough, but nothing to right home about. The overdone carbonation really hurts it, I think.

The beer itself is pretty opaque and formed a pretty minimal head in my glass. This beer had a very large bouquet of fruit in the smell. It was overall pretty citrus-y with a mix of orange and lemon smells in it as well as a small hint of the hops in the beer. Once I tasted it, the smell of the fruit obviously right. It produced a slightly woodsy taste to it (almost reminiscent of cedar). It also had an aftertaste of the hops and barley. The beer was also extremely carbonated. Also, of note, the combination of the carbonation, fruits and the sweet flavors almost made this beer seem like a wine. The progression of flavors and textures in the beer made this probably one of the smoothest beers Ive ever had.","Long Valley, New Jersey, USA","dekeq"

552,"2009-09-29",3.9,"75cl corked bottle, as shown. Dark, hazy copper colour, very big, soapy off-white head that collapses rather quickly. Bottle-conditioned double. Complex aroma of fruit, aniseed and candy, not unlike a fruity Bavarian Hefeweizen. The complexity is maintained in the taste: very sweet and fruity at first, then sour and spicy, with a strong and lingering candy-like finish. Aftertaste somewhat bitter. The 7 % abv will weigh you down easily, but theyre well integrated into the taste fabric. However, this is a very sweet-ish Belgian double, and if you dont like that kind of taste, steer clear of Chimay (also of the ""Bleue"" variety). You should drink this cool IMHO, otherwise the sweetness may become too penetrating. While this is clearly a well-crafted brew, I still favour the more bitterish English ESB equivalent.

Pour is a very murky brown with some floaties and a nice eggshell white head that gets pretty big bud also disappointingly dies down rather quickly.

Smell is great, bread and some light spice and malty goodness, no sign of hops.

Taste is surprisngly bold, mimicking the characteristics of nose with a bit more prominent spice. This is going to rank in front of the White but behind the Blue as far as my taste is concerned.

As with most Belgians, the mouth is refined to a point where you almost take it for granted. Relatively thin and bubbly, where it needs to be.

552,"2009-07-10",4.1,"Originally reviewed 5/16/2009...

Let this one (750) warm while trying something else. Corked & caged with a fairly hefty pop of the cork. Into an Ommegang chalice it goes.

Pours what can be described as a murky bourbon color. With a little less red it would resemble a dunkel. Almost a full-finger of bleached ginger-colored head, but it goes quickly, leaving slight yeasty wisps in its wake. Sparse, moderate-speed carbonation.

A slight Belgian sourness is in the forefront at first, but peelin the onion back, but theres plenty of dried and ripe dark fruits backing this deal up. The usual suspects...dates, plums...even a few prunes in there. A little cinnamon and clove with even a touch of praline sweetness behind it all and some dark muscat notes. This is what a Dubbel should be. Still, light-bodied enough not to scare anyone away.

Grain profile is rather hearty, but the taste and body are a little lean...at first. Sure, everythings in there from the nose but its more aromatic and may not deliver the impact as it rolls down the gullet. Grains and light stewy roast (is there Special B in here? New to the whole brewing deal but it seems like thats the ticket) are full-bodied as mentioned but overall weight class may be a bit lean. Good, but lean. The carbonation drives the spice home nicely with only a slight saltiness. Mental note: Let this one warm quite a bit. Would like just a little more sweetness - it actually seems a bit peppery...but its still quite good. Yeast electricity still shines.

This one plays lighter than expected - we have the carbonation to thank for that. Deep dark stewiness is countered by spritely carbonation and pepperiness and other spice along with yeast electricity to dance on the palate and enjoy the ride down. Finish is clean for a normally hefty style.

I have been meaning to review this for a few days but have had to go back to get more at the store. Yknow why? Cause I enjoy drinking it immensely and writing about it gets in the way of its enjoyment. Whaddya think about that? Its damn good.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

Aroma: Strongly yeasty, winy, very well pronounced notes of red, fresh fruits like red currant, wildberry, red grapes, cherry, plum, notes of peanuts and wallnuts, very fresh and juicy, quite strong and essential, slightly woody and some strange notes of spicyness giving mixed reception and varing opinions, dry autumn leaves, dirt, well aged and quite ripe but all in all not that multidimensional as expected, powder sugar, some notes of English and American hops, very Dubbel like.
Flavour: Very strong taste in overall impression, very focused and nice, strong bitterness, very dry, some Crystal and Pilsen malt, leavy hops, great aftertaste, very warming beer with long lingering finish, very mellow, yeasty texture, thick because of yeast, perfectly hidden alcohol but contributing to the fantastic warmth in the aftertaste, notes of red fruits, wallnut skin bitterness, winy, red wine grapes, plum, cherry, Porto wine, very robust, kind of tangy, very spicy, great flavour as compared to its appearance and better but still not that good aroma.

RE-RATE 3/28/11 Bottle from World Market.  This beer pours a lightly cloudy amber red, rich with orange highlights.  There is a nice smooth white head that doesnt disappear.  It gets fairly murky towards the top of the glass.

Man I could smell this beer from way above the glass.  All good things though!  It has a very yeasty smell, even though I saved the yeast dregs at the bottom of the bottle and saved them for my homebrew.  There is a nice dark fruit aroma as well, such as black cherries or tart plum.  Very nice.

The flavor is immediately lightly tart, which reminds me of grape juice.  A nice touch of sweet flavors from the fruitiness also fill in well.  It finishes with a yeasty dryness that doesnt linger longer than need be.  The alcohol begins to be tasted at warmer temperatures, but only in the slightest.

552,"2009-02-18",4.1,"The first of my Authentic Trappist beers.  Im pretty pumped about this one.

Serving:  11.2 oz bottle poured into my Chimay glass.  08-314 stamped on label.

A:  Pours a dark brown/copper.  Very cloudy and hard to see through.  Fine beige head.  Floaties big and small but not numerous.  Definite lace work. 

S:  Malty sweet aroma.  Reminds me of cheap whiskey aroma.  Toasty.  Complex.  There is a aroma I cant put my nose on.  Slight hops too, but not too noticeable.  Spice, clove.

T:  Fruity and sweet with a touch of hops.  There is that whiskey malt again.  Earth and wood, maybe a tad whiff of smoke too.  A slight alcoholic bite, but not bad at all.  Very flavorful.

M:  The carbonation is nipping at my tongue.  A longish finish makes me want to take another drink right away to replenish what Im tasting.  Just a tad dry and bitter.

D:  Very drinkable for 7% ABV.  Its not overly expensive for being a beer from one of the six Trappist breweries.  

Overall, I am very pleased with my first true Trappist brew.  I have read that Red is not the best from Chimay, but that ok because I bought the gift set with all three plus my awesome goblet.  So, I only have two more to look forward to!","Canton, Illinois, USA","jmw141"

Taste/Mouth feel: There is a good sweet malty body that is full of fruity notes like apricot, dates and plums that mixes with some earthy yeast. In the middle there is a very slight astringency. It also has some light herbal hops spice and a pleasant alcohol that adds depth and warmth. In the finish the sweetness fades off giving way to dry earthy yeast.

Appealing dry fruity aromas are on the nose from the get-go, coming across nicely even through its colossal head. Once the dust has cleared (or head in this case) the apricot becomes decidedly more apparent with the hint of banana too. This is exceedingly smooth on the palate from beginning to end. The carbonation is apparent, but not excessive allowing its soft textures to be appreciated.

There is a light touch of bitterness in the taste, but it does pour down smooth.  The only real drawback is that the flavor is a little thin.  After the blue, this is the second best Chimay beer.

552,"2007-11-29",4.0,"I had heard a lot about this, of course, and I got a  small bottle at a local restaurant. Im not wild about the design of the bottle & label, but the label at least is distinctive. The beer poured with a pretty nice, foamy head, but unfortunately a lot of it slopped over on to the bar. The thick body was a very dark reddish brown. The aroma was excellent: sweet, fruity, and yeasty, with (to my nose) a faint touch of apple. Taste was a richly complex sweet and sour mix, surpisingly mild but with just the right amount of hops to give it bite. It took some getting used to, but grew on me quickly. Its smooth, too, no foul tail at all. The palate was good also, a bit watery to start with but then you get a real tickle in the throat--and the nose, too. The kick is quite substantial, even in the small bottle, so be prepared. This is really a fine beer, though the price will probably keep me from getting it too often. Lovely stuff.","USA","Allie"

I had never had a beer before or since that was worse than that first Chimay Red. Now, ten years later, and a more ""sophisticated"" beer drinker, it was time to give it another shot. And the result.....its a pretty good beer. The aroma isnt much, as it is slightly fruity and yeasty. It is a great looking beer, as it poured a cloudy amber color with a nice off-white head.

552,"2007-11-03",3.9,"IMO, the best of the three Chimays (Red, White, Blue).  This beer has a lot of different characteristics to like:  its lightly fruity, theres a bit of roastiness, and it is also a bit spicey (clove or coriander or both).  Easily the most complex of the three, and to me, the most likable.

Appearance is a nice red-brown, which is not quite opaque.  Head formation is decent, whitish, of uniformly sized bubbles, and sticks around an average amount of time.  Aroma is of dried fruit, and a bit of spice.  Flavor is more of the same, but adds a layer of light roastiness.  The fruitiness exists in a dried fruit sense, but also exerts itself as lightly sour (like sour cherries).  Mouthfeel was a bit astringent and drying, which youd expect from a beer with roasty and sour characteristics.  I really liked this beer.

Ive had this in restaurants before (all the Chimays seem like theyre popping in fine-dining places everywhere), and it is usually served much too cold.  This beer really seems to shine at about 50-55 degrees.

Definitely recommended.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

Prunes, raisins and grapes are the main fruity flavours.  The sweet malt-base feels more like maple sap than caramel.  Despite being very very fruity with grapes upfront the beer never gets vinous.  Fruity finish, a quick bitterness at the end is not enough to really pierce the fruity taste.  Very active carbonation with a little minerals touch.  Very good beer although this type of classic fruity Belgian ales is an over-crowded genre.  Classic.  My least favourite of the excellent Chimay line-up.  Always nice to go back to an old love as Orval and Chimay are two of the beers that turned me into good beers.  I was drinking Chimay back in the early 1990s.  Things were very different back then, there was a crazy G.W. Bush as president of the USA fighting a meaningless war in the middle east nevermind.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The flavour is nicely complex, very sweet, notes of caramalts for sure, some raisins, almost some bready malts in there which I did not expect at all! It gives way to a dull bite mid-palate, which to me seems like the only detectable presence of hops and alcohol. Very smooth on the palate, other than the finish, which is long.

App.:  Deep brownish-ruby, clear for now, rocky off-white head.

Palate:  Medium-full body, medium effervescence.
  
Flav.:  Light apricot, followed by a wave of malt-like flavours from the nose, a touch of cardboard and light hops; a little woody and alcoholic to finish; very restrained bitterness; feels almost refreshing.

552,"2007-08-26",3.3,"UPDATED: JAN 4, 2010 From a 33cl bottle on august 26, 07 at a Botulfs in Lund.   Aroma is floral and citrusy with a touch of alcohol.   Rich cloudy redish brown color with a thin off-white head that dissipates quickly.   Flavour is well balanced with caramel malt dominating and the high alcohol showing slightly with the hop notes in the aftertaste.  Palate is rich with lively carbonation that sticks around as the beer warms.   Overall, a good beer-the best that ive had in Sweden so far.   This is my first Abbey Dubbel and if it is typical of the style, then i am looking forward to trying more.   I would have liked slightly more hop bite to balance the richness of the malt, but it worked all the same. (6,4,7,4,16)
Rerate: 33cl bottle.   Its been over two years, but Im finally getting around to rerating my first beer on the site.   Back then I had no idea what a dubbel was supposed to taste like, I just knew that I thought this was a pretty good beer and it sparked my interest in Belgian beer and the Trappists in particular.   I have certainly come along way since then, rating 22 other dubbels in the mean time.   I am certainly not as impresses with Rouge now as I was then, but it is still a decent beer.   The flavor seems a little too thin and devoid of malt character, with an almost washed-out yeast profile, but it still hangs on to a nice balance and some dried fruit flavors including apricot and prune, with a lightly spicy edge.   The aroma is a touch yeasty and doughy with some clove, cookie and cooked red apple, but lacks the depth and impact of better dubbels.   Light bodied and a little airy with carbonation that could be tighter and creamier.   If it sounds like Im just hating at this point, its only because I once built this beer up so much; I still dont dislike it, it just really isnt anything special once youve been around the block a few times.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

552,"2007-04-28",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2007 To me Chimay, as a brand name, represents the distinctly European sophistication and erudition that was somehow lost when those early continentals floated across the Atlantic to our fledgling nation.  Not that America doesnt have its fair share of scholars and appreciable achievements in the sciences (social science too), but we never see any Henry Higgins wandering the streets carousing with locals and berating their ignorance.  Somehow the tweed jacket seems forced, with pipes replaced by cigarettes and tea by coffee.  The Chimay Red is a drinkable vestige of this Old World cognoscenti, passionate and assertive, yet refined and reserved.  Its colored like a well-used redwood mantle piece cast in slivered sunlight, blanketed in dust, and crowned with a thick, spongy, heavy cream colored head.  Aged, odiferous cheese is the mainstay of the aroma, conjuring images of cheese served on ornate silver platters, smooth, salty but also pungent.  The distinctive smell of yeast adds to the fermentation theme, inciting a hunger for some bread, while a white grape note rounds out the savory flavors with a traditional and classic, wine-like character.  The Chimay Reds taste is abound with similar tried and true flavors, emanating a feel of traditional French cooking.  Before I notice any specific ingredients, however, Im struck by the smooth and creamy texture of the Red.  It is frothy and soft  a gratifying mouth feel, perfect for indoors or temperate weather drinking.  The flavors catch me by surprise as I relish in the palate, introducing themselves with solid doses of banana fosters, heavy cream, sweet orange liqueur and a generous proportion of alcohol.  Its warming to the touch, and a textural experience unlike any other.  The strong-willed flavors, especially the alcohol, make the Chimay Red a bold beverage, capable of holding its own even in the strongest culinary bouts, making it an ideal pairing for some heavier meals.  Root vegetable based stews, soups, pork roast and maybe even tender beef dishes, like a medium cooked Beef Wellington would all do well to meet the Chimay Red on equal terms on the tongue.  It is satisfying, fancy and assertive, and every bit a beer that gives me the feeling Im enjoying it in an intellectual parlor somewhere in a charming, urban European setting on a cool spring evening, although it would be of appreciable service in almost any environ.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

552,"2007-04-20",3.6,"Sampled at a blind abbey dubbel tasting hosted by tennisjoel on 4-14-07, along with eight other beers. This was the ninth and final beer that we tasted.

The overwhelming winner of the night was t Smisje Dubbel, with Corsendonk Pater finishing a strong if distant second.

The alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming in the taste. Subtle, good flavors overall. Medium in body. High carbonation Smooth, frothy, and lively in the palate.

It tastes like a strong Leffe, with a sweet flowery taste, and a fruity aroma that stays with you until the last sip.  This beer isnt for everyone however.

552,"2007-03-24",4.5,"I first discovered this beer in a small hidden-away bar in Ambleside in the Lake District, England, and it has to be one of my favourites, with Leffe running it close for top spot. The white and blue are also good, but the palate of the red is delightful. Serve semi-chilled with a generous head, preferably in a wide goblet-style glass. The corked bottle adds a touch of class to a beer-tasting evening! The only down side really is the somewhat prohibitive price.","London, ENGLAND","Shmuel"
552,"2007-03-23",3.0,"I tried a bottle of this beer after not really liking the previous two Belgium beers I had (Nice Chouffe and Orval).  Neither were my type of beer.  I decided to try the Chimay, as it was recommended to me that if I didnt like the others I tried, I would probably like this one.  At first I did feel it tasted better than the other Belgium Ales I tried, but after awhile I realized that the aftertaste (which was a heavy amount of sweet/fruity overtones) was just not to my liking.  Since the Belgium Ales always seem to get high marks, I want to like them - but I guess my tastes go towards other types of beers (like a porter or a stout).  I am not saying this beer is bad, far from it.  It is just not the taste I am personally looking for.","USA","miket25"

Yeast sediment riding atop the creamy cap gives the appearance of cinnamon-sprinkled cappucino, and the quarter-inch of cream lasts all the way down. Nose is bitter yeast/nut/corn/hop/skunk. Extremely well-blended and difficult to isolate any dominant taste. Creamy palate is the best I have sampled, almost like a cask nitro. Definitely on the dry side, and hoppier than other Belgians I have sampled. Alcohol not evident at all.

552,"2007-02-02",3.3,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2007 Rerate: Pour is amber and a murky consistency.  Head is there but pretty much totally disappears.  Flavor is dried fruit and some sour apple.  I think one of the problems with this beer is the flavor is too thin for the carbonation level.  Maybe if the carbonation was toned down, the flavors would come out better.  Well, I had some the second day and this had improved after this flattened out. 
Original rating: 11.2 oz bottle.  Muddy orange brown body with small yeast particles floating throughout.  Light aromas of band aid, spice, and some dried fruits.  Rather large head quickly diminishes.  Light bodied.  Heavy on the carbonation with a dry finish.  This by no means is terrible, but this has to be the weakest out of the Chimay line (although I havent had the white or blue for a long time).  I remember being fairly impressed by those beers.  This one, is more average.  Simple, but Im looking for complex when paying $4-$5 for a bottle of this.

It is somewhere in between baby-food (the canned sludge) and stale puke - with a bit of goose liver thrown in. This smell got more and more pronounced as the beer warmed. Dark fruit in the background though, if you can believe it. Decent taste, a bit too soft/rounded for me - maybe too balanced. And ofcourse, the gooseliver babypuke notes didnt help much. Smooth mouthfeel, a bit like the aforementioned babyfood-sludge, stale puke and goose liver were thrown into a blender and mashed into a delicious smoothie.

Taste; as with the smell, the flavors are not very assertive. Theres a little bit of raisins and some chocolate. Theres aso a bit of apples as well as a slightly woody quality.The mouthfeel is a bit watery and thin, and rather boring for a dubble.

Nicely carbonated.  Mouthfeel is good and average.  Nothing amiss.

552,"2006-10-13",4.4,"Pours to a hazy reddish brown, with off-white head that lingers thru most of the glass and reduces to decent lacing. Had a nice, pleasant aroma of dark fruit and malty sweetness. Taste was marked by just enough carbonation to add some zing, to the malty sweet dary fruit. About 3/4 thru, the 7% alcohol began kicking in, and this all led to a long, warming finish. I really enjoyed this beer.","Dacula, Georgia, USA","kimcgolf"
552,"2006-10-13",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2006 The beer pours a hazy reddish brown with flashes of a garnet-red. Pour produced a massive, fluffy, creamy off-white head.  Nose of malt with a sweet and a strong spicy note, yeasty with hints of plums and raisins and just a hint of herbaceous hops. Silky mouth-feel with a crisp champagne-like carbonation and a medium body. Flavors reflect aroma with a heavy clove flavor initially which persists throughout the drinking session. Malts and caramel along with chocolate and dark toffee. Dried fruit notes call to mind figs and plums. Finish is fairly dry with a balanced bitterness. Excellent!","New Hope, Alabama, USA","mbeem"
552,"2006-10-10",4.3,"750ml cork top bottle from the LCBO.  This is an absolutely incredible beer, period.  I had read some bad things about the ""mass market"" style that Chimay has taken, but as far as Im concerned its just a story, and the beer speaks for itself!  It pours a wonderful dark auburn brown, with golden molasses tones when held to light.  The head is thick, and lasts the whole glass through, leaving a very nice fine lacing.  The smell is sweet and crisp, with strong bread dough notes, yeast, and some fruit that is hard to place.  The taste is exquisite, and so balanced that its remarkable.  Its bold in all aspects, like a trappist should be, but no heavy alcohol taste or smell.  The aftertaste is exactly as it should be; a subdued version of the initial taste.  The balanced nature of the beer lets you pick out little subtleties in the aftertaste that make every sip another adventure, even after youve had it several times.  This beer is so solid, and so balanced, that it should be used as a benchmark to judge other trappist beers.  I know there are better trappist beers out there, but this is the best baseline Ive run across.  If you havent tried this beer yet, make it your next one!","Ontario, CANADA","opc"

Milkily creamy palate without a trace of alcohol. If anything, this beer is just too neutral and smooth, and slips inoffensively down without developing any really distinct flavours. Wheres the finish? Wheres the hops? Its all watery malt and milky caramel. Smells fantastic, but not as tasty or balanced as the last beer I sampled (Bitburger Pils). (Re-rate, 01/02/08) Some hops, earthy yeast and Trappist character, which is surprising. But too much stale cardboard. Gentle liquorice bitterness to finish. Thin and papery/ashy like Leffe.

Dark sugars and dried fruit, mostly sultanas, run the show, leaving some place for a yeast note. Some ripe blue plums as well. It’s quite full-bodied and slightly warming in the mouth, with flavors of dried fruits, ripe blue plums and sugars. Some caramel too, and it’s quite effervescent. Good bitterness in the finish, which else has the same flavors found initially. A really good beer that I find a bit hard to rate.

552,"2006-09-02",3.9,"Simply put, Chimay is classy. Even non craft beer Savants will appreciate a Chimay whether it is the Red White or Blue. Personally, I prefer the Blue and I would not call this beer (the Red) one of my favorites, there are so many other classy beers for celebratory occasions; but this one does have its time and place. 

Appearance: Served in my goblet the appearance is party translucent (but not transparent) amber / brown, with a decent head and nice lacing. 

Smell: The smell is sweet & malty with suggestions of caramel and plums. It also has some fruity characteristics and hints of yeast. 

Taste & Mouthfeel: This beer is very carbonated. It is sweet and bubbly in the mouth. The taste seems a bit straightforward and simple for a Dubbel. It is pleasant but not extremely exciting. Sweet malts and flavors of dark fruits and caramel sugars dominate the mouth. The hop notes are very subtle but present. It is very crisp. Maybe the high carbonation is partly responsible for the thinness in the taste. As it sits and warms the over carbonation fades and its best aspect seems to be the sweet aftertaste that lingers in your mouth for a very long time. Nice.

Drinkability: For a simple bubbly beer this is a great choice for graduation parties and anniversaries with a wide variety of drinkers. It is simple enough on the palate that few people will find it objectionable. It will successfully accompany a wide variety of food selections and it goes down very easily. So, like I said before, Chimay Première (Red) does have its time and place.

Hope this is helpful.

Great spicy, fruity, distinctly belgian aroma.  (I am pretty new to belgians, so I dont have a better way of describing it yet.)  I would assume Im getting some esters and cloves.  Flavor doesnt necessarily live up to what I expected out of the aroma.  Just doesnt seem to be all that complex.  Just a kind of bitter with a distinct belgian aftertaste, but doesnt seem to be a ton there.  A little yeasty and herby.  Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and light.  Its good, but for the price there has to be much better dubbels out there.  I do have to add that the flavor did get a little better and more complex as the beer warmed.

There are notes of caramel and fruit, sizzling from the front of the pull through the finish.  Hops, however insinuated, blend well into the brew.  I agree with some others (""alabamajohn"" below, for instance), this has a definite champagne mouthfeel - almost exactly the same.  It goes down well, without the complexity of its big brother.

Palate is silky and velvet like with perfect levels of carbonation that smooths out. Flavor shows its true colors through a rich vanilla cream profile and hides a distant yeast and spice in the background.  Some sign of the fruit detected but very faint and almost goes unnoticed.

552,"2005-09-14",3.5,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2012 (2011 BB, 2007 bottling tasted 9/12): looking good and confirms my confidence in the ability of this beer to age.  Settled soft chocolate and mild funky aged notes. High fizz levels for the age but not to the detriment. Will look to cellar age.

Re-Rate (2003 bottlling tasted 8/07): Certainly not inferior to younger samples I have tasted over the years. Really attractive to look at with a perfectly formed creamy head and murky brown body, not unlike the Rochefort 6 consumed just hours prior. Nose shows aromas of settled malts and hints of sweet milk chocolate, as well as a definate pongy edge that might be more commonly found in a Flemish sour ale. Palate is also settled, very balanced and very friendly. Nice milky chocolate notes pop up again, together with a midly spicy but quite long finish. Easily the best Rouge Ive had from Chimay.

(9/05): Big fizzy headupon pouring but disappears almost immediately. Light brown with a red hue. Some cloudiness, quite appealing. Classic Belgium nose of cloves, heavy malts, some spice, although quite subtle. Palate IMHO disappoints and is not worthy of the Chimay monicker. Very subdued flavours, almost to the point of being dilutive, the only telling character being some enthusiastic carbonation.  Bad bottle? (2.5)","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"

552,"2005-05-28",3.8,"11.20 oz. bottle from The Andersons, Columbus, OH.  Lovely orange-red with tons of tiny sediment at the bottom of the bottle; monstrous, white, fizzy, frothy head thats easily recreated with some light swirling.  Aroma is Belgian yeast, alcohol, and apple/pear.  Flavor is more of the Belgian yeast with an excellently balanced and complementing light bitterness; slight pleasant pungency (the description says ""astringency""); light alcohol warmth and evaporation through the nose.  At first I felt this was too thin but as I drank it, it seemed to be come more full; TONS of carbonation, with the beer becoming just a bunch of bubbly froth in the mouth until the beer is allowed to sit and ""burn off"" some of it; slightly sticky after all.  Overall, this is not a knockout beer; what is impressive about it is the sheer craft of the beer; it wont knock you on your ass, but its impressive how subtle and how incredibly well balanced it is, how it all fits how and all aspects of the beer just work together.  I am looking forward to some of the ""heavier"" Trappists.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sfontain"

Low Cabernet red grape and general vinous aromas, yeasty and earthy. A little toffee for sweetness, but more malty and peaty. Aroma follows through into the mouth, well rounded flavours, light, very fine carbonation, medium bodied, and quite fairy floss sweet throughout, with earthy undertones, leafy hops, gritty malt and a generous dark fruit, almost blackcurrant, zest, that adds a needed balance. Quite Scotch ale peaty, good length in the bitter and lowly sweet swallow, but, like a good red wine, I could tell it was young.

There is a tart, sweet fruity hop aroma with light sourdough bread  undertone, a touch of mustiness and hints of cherry, raisin and toasted caramel. The flavor was tart, bitter and had light touches of fruity and floral hops, cherry, sugar, caramel, nut and a faint musty undertone.

552,"2005-03-01",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2008 Rerate, 330 ml bottle, now available in Norway (Vinmonopolet, + Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger): ABV is 7.0%. Hazy brown colour, big and lasting off-white head. Spicy complex aroma and flavour, some winey and woody notes too. The mouthfeel has still too much carbonation, but this is none the less a very fine beer. I’m upping it a few points. Original rating: 330 ml bottle, at the White Horse at Parsons Green, London. Served in ""appropriate"" Chimay glass (whether those wide chalices really ARE the most appropriate for savouring complex beers, is a discussion of its own). Unfortunately served far too cold - youd think White Horse waiters knew better. For good measure, the waiter poured the beer along the side of the glass, which prevented the beer from ""opening up"", the head disappeared quickly and the beer kept too much carbonation. The beer has a brown colour, aroma of leather, balsamico vinegar and barnyard. Flavour is quite dry, well hopped, elements of leather and tobacco. Hints of cardamom and ginger. Aroma and flavour improves somewhat as the beer slowly warms up, but altogether this remains my least favourite of the Chimays  - give me a Bleu, please!

552,"2004-12-31",3.4,"33 cl bottle:  Hazy amber brown color w/a  lasting off white head.  Yeasty, vinous raisin ester, and a little earthy/musty.  Fresh baked bready malt, hints of alcohol, and an every so slight hint of roast with some bakers chocolate & diacetyl.  Well balanced, but is lightly to bitter.  Some roast comes through a little stronger than I remember it in this one and is almost coffee like.  Dry flavor overall in the finish with some herbal hop flavors as well that linger into the aftertaste.  Toasted matl comes through after the roastiness up front.  Very little fruitiness as I also remember it having more.  Highly carbonated, medium body, and lightly astringent.  Alcohol is only lightly noticeable in the mouth.  Overall, Im a little disappointed with this beer, or at least this bottle.  I seem to remember it being a little more complex.  Fruity esters are low in the flavor and it seems to be a little over hopped for my taste.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

552,"2004-12-18",3.4,"33cl bottle, Sampled December 2004
Pours a lightly hazy amber copper color that is topped by a pale amber head that is large and frothy.  The beer is well carbonated with a steady cascade of bubbles rising form the bottom of my glass.  The aroma is typical of the chime yeast with notes of bubblegum, alcohol, fruity notes of plum and raisin, some spicy notes of ginger, all-spice, and clove.  The fruity notes are definitely the dominant ones in the nose.

The taste is lightly sweet, with soft fruity notes of plum, raisin, fig and clove  up front.  The beer then moves to a sharp note that is a mix of carbonation, and yeast derived esters, as well as a bit of alcohol in the finish.  The beer is quite light on the palate, almost a bit too thin.  There is a certain level of astringency in the finish, which I have always found a bit distracting in beer brewed with the Chimay yeast strain.

Overall this is not a bad brew, certainly nothing to get really excited about, but it is a solid beer.  It really could use a boost in the malt intensity / body department though, it just seems a bit thin.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

In the mouth, tasty enough, but not much more than average...nutty, slightly chocolatey, very light, very lean, leaves the palate quickly, though...and a dull fuzz remains on the tongue, and dies...pretty average, really. 
Boy, this used to be a good beer, I mean, a really good beer, but, this is just kind of dull. Medium bodied, dull, soporific finish...fizzy cola-ish taste...very dull, compared to other Belgian, hey, even, no, especially American offerings!!!

Overall, I personally didnt care for the flavor at all (pear and champagne).  I really dont like champagne and this was way too similar for me.

552,"2004-06-01",4.1,"There were floaters in the middle of the large bottle and noticeable sediment on the bottom.  It poured a big off while head with popping bubbles.  It was mostly diminishing.  At first the color in a full glass reminded me of plum wine, but slightly lighter and with a little orange.  Small bubbles rose from the bottom of the glass.  Initially, it felt lively on the tongue and released a flavor that is hard for me to describe.  After a short bit the liveliness died down allowing it to become smooth all the way through.  It had a nice full round mouth feel that was clean after the swallow.  The flavors started with what reminded me of warm doughy bread with a hint if nuts.  It ended with a pleasurable metallic astringency, which lightly remained in the after taste.  If drank quickly it has a sharp harshness that quickly builds up.  It is a very good beer that I will have again.  The reason for the lower aroma rating is because I have not been very successful in telling the difference between beers for a while.","Westville, Indiana, USA","craven5000"

Nice off-white head with a good amount of retention.  Not much lacing.  Very malty and fruity tatste.  No hops in the taste like the smell indicated.  Slight alcohol taste, but for the most part covered up rather well.  Virtually no aftertaste.  Alcohol taste intensifies as you drink but never becomes overpowering.  Excellent beer.  Bleu gets the higher average rating, but I think this is much better. (8-4-8-4-17)

Bottle (33cL):  Well, its finally time for a re-rate.  The aroma is moderately fruity with raisins, grapes, faint apples, candi sugar, yeast, and light spiciness.  It pours a hazy reddish-orange with a moderate off-white head with decent retention.  The flavor starts with moderate fruitiness thats just like the aroma with a nice mixture of raisins, grapes, and faint apple.  There some slight candi sugar in the background.  The finish is somewhat spicy with some metallic notes that are somewhat iron-like.  Medium bodied with a nice smooth and creamy mouthfeel.  As the beer warmed the iron flavors began to disappear, but never disappeared completely.

Promising aromas of candi sugar, spice (nutmeg/clove/anise), candied fruits, chocolate-covered raisins. Flavor is complex, but eludes an accurate description; the closest I can get is amber malts, dark rye bread, almost-chocolate, fig, mineral water, and a very light acidity. Some (noble?) hop bitterness rears its head and then fades away in the effervescent, fluffy mouthfeel. Finishes dry with an aftertaste that is vaguely chocolate, lightly peppery and nutmeggy, cocoa powder, and... fresh parsley? Tastier than blue or white label, in my opinion. I could imagine pairing this with turkey or pulled porked, with mole sauce.","New Mexico, USA","maltdog"

Aromatic spicey, chocolate, fruity, soapy with notes of cherry scents. Prickley spiced flavours. Body is medium, relatively rich and bread crustiness is prevalent. Carries some yeasty sourness.

The red, in particular, was strong and complex and I decided there and then that if this was Trappist beer I liked it.  However, recent tastings have left a bad taste in the mouth in more ways than one.  The colour is the same, but the aroma is wheaty and vegetal.  The body has vanished almost completely, with only a thin wheat, cardboard and chemically taste present, fading out quickly.  They say the recipe hasn’t changed in years.  I don’t believe them.

552,"2004-01-30",4.9,"750 ml. big 'ole brown corked & caged Belgian bottle. Bottling date of 1/02/03. January 2, 2003 was a good day for bottling Chimay, because mine is wonderful. Poured out a hazy, rusty orange color.
The cork shot out of the bottle first. Very effervescent, highly carbonated. Huge head at first, mocha cream in color. Slowly slid back to a thick matting, and even more lacing down my Chimay chalice. Huge island of yeast floated in the middle of the beer.
Aromas are of caramel malts, lactic wheat tang, fresh cut hay, slight earthy & slightly musty aromas as well. I could go on describing this beer all day, because it is so complex, and so well made. Only 1 point off for cloudiness. Other than that, it was perfect. Tastes the same as it smells. Slight lactic wheat tang, enormous malty backbone supports the hops very well. Noble hops make an all too brief appearance towards the end. Bready, yeasty bite, and smooth mouthfeel make for a great beer.
I wish I lived down the road from this Abbey.","","Cobra"
552,"2004-01-29",2.5,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2004 750ml bottle.  Pours reddish-brown with a large, lasting, fluffy head.  Aroma is mildly malty with some yeasty notes, but uninspiring.  Thin body yields simplistic flavours that disappoint.  The typical full, sweet, and fruity flavours that one expects in a Dubbel are only vaguely apparent, with more off-putting cardboard flavours in the background.  There has been a lot of controversy surrounding Chimay over the last few years concerning ingredients, recipes, and cost-cutting, but who knows where the truth lies?  Having enjoyed this many times in the past, I can only say that this is not the same beer that built Chimays worldwide reputation, nor the beer that will sustain it.  
Update (7/19/2004):  750ml bottle, aged 18 months.  The aroma and flavour have a much more pronounced dark fruitalmost vinouscharacter.  Slightly fuller mouthfeel.  Less of the cardboard taste.  Probably gains a few points here and there, but still very disappointing.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Wheatsheaf"

Body is medium and the carbonation, while quite lively in the glass, is not overly so on the tongue. Pre-RateBeer this and the Ommegang brews were about the only Belgian-style beers I ever drank. I quite surprised at how well this beer stands up to the many other Belgians I have had since joining RateBeer. It is not in the Westvleteren class of Trappist brews but it is still quite a beer.

Fruit/floral aroma. Kind of an odd taste, I thought it was a bad bottle, but the descriptions on this site match what I taste. Strong taste, sticks to the palate.

Underneath a massive, fluffy, light tan head is a burgundy body with hints of amber, red, and peach. The head fills half of my goblet on the pour, and takes quite a while to shrink. Leaves decent lacing on my glass.  Aroma of sweet fruit intermingled with a strong spice note. This one has a very distinctive yeasty aroma.  Flavorful with lots of fruit and spice in an acceptable balance. A bit heavy on the yeast flavor... The finish has a really slight smokiness that I haven't ever noticed before. While it starts off nice and somewhat rich, it's aftertaste leaves something to be desired, as it's a bit thin and lacking in complexity.  Fairly thin body with a crisp, dry mouthfeel. Finishes with a tart dryness that, unfortunately, seems to highlight the subpar aftertaste. A bit watery, and not quite worthy of the reputation that having the term Trappist on the label denotes.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MarkR"

Mild coffee, milk chocolate, caramel, nutty malt (heavy); flowery hops (light); earth, cobweb yeast (heavy); raisin, plum, red wine, port, oak, toffee, alcohol aromas.  Moderately sweet throughout, lightly bitter, lightly acidic finish.  Flavor is lightly than the aroma led me to believe it would be.  Medium body, fizzy carbonation, watery texture with an alcohol-drying effect.  I'd really like to try a fresher bottle to see if the robustness I was expecting is present.

552,"2003-08-29",4.2,"It was with great anticipation that I opened my bottle of Chimay Red. The first time I had tasted this ale, it was during a night of drinking. I was pretty much pissed at the time and I didn't expect the brick that slammed into my face when I drank my glass. I called it a slow burn then, but hey, I was drunk, so what did I know?

I was ready to taste it properly this time, and so I did.

The Chmay Red poured a deep amber with lively rising columns of carbonation. The thick, creamy head rose like a cloud above my Chimay chalice. The beer looks wonderful.

A vague fruitiness layered with a more harsh smell that, although not exact, reminded me of nutmeg. The aroma was as powerful as I expected.

This was a different time and a different day so I was ready to be objective. No slow burn this time and no grimace. The flavor is spicy. the carbonatio heightens the bite of this beer and there's no hiding the alcoholic content, it packs a punch but with great flavor.

This is a very good beer although I put it last among the three Chmays. However, that's definitely not a bad thing because all three are great.","Addison, Texas, USA","kindestcut"

Smell is one complex mother of a dubble, quite unique, good smokeyness comes through with bacon and smoked dried oranges, sweet smokey malts, other dark but dullish fruit of plum and raisin, candied toffee notes and what I'm guessing is alot of wild yeast and a bit of cherry as well. Hard to get past the smokey sense, but it tames as it sits longer.

Taste is smooth and creamy delight of complexity, let this sit awhile after pouring, it seemed to ripen on the vine as it warmed a bit. Finally as I begin to reward my taste buds it starts with a touch of mint up front leading right into a punch of sweet malts, dulled oranges and dark fruits, mostly plum, a subtle touch of raisin, cherry, and toffee. The smokey sense from the smell is all but null and void. I was hoping it would maybe show up somewhere as it warmed, but nope. Towards the end it pick up some banana esters and good amounts of milding spice, clove, and yeast keeping this very smooth and quite full, a bit of a tingly-fluffy carbonation shows up late towards the finish.

552,"2003-06-04",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2009 Bottle.
Reddish-orange color. With amber and copper tinges.  Smells like plum and alcohol.  Initial taste has cherry flavored notes which are highly pleasant.  Alcohol begins to come out immediately and does not overpower.  Body is medium and there is a round flavor on the palate throughout.  It warms very very nicely and many more plum, cherry and other fruit notes are apparent.  Ends with a nice yeasty alcohol taste, that leaves a bit more to be desired body wise (I finished mine very quickly) but other than this, no complaints.  Rerate, blind dubbel tasting.  I sure dont remember this one being this full and flavorful, but wow. My friend and I both picked this one as our favorite (and best of style) hands down.  Ripe red fruits, soft cherry cola, medium dark malts, bubbly palate and a wonderful yeastiness.  The fruit was fabulous though and really put this one on top.

Metallic nose too, and after some time, dark malts and just a hint of hops. Very little bit metallic taste, then roasted malts, spicey - don't dare to say hops - and, definitely, salts. There is some salty whiff in this brew. Retronasal again meaty - and fruity notes, or preserved fruit. Rather light-bodied, certainly for its 7% ABV. Something velvety, however, on the tongue. The wheat 'flour' showing? I cannot follow people who praise this to heaven, nor those who will see nothing but a commercially denaturated product in this beer. An above average, reasonnable beer.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

Accessible it may be, but even still, it's a damn fine beer!  The body is a beautiful hazy chestnut, topped by a small tan head.  The aroma is Belgian yeasty, medium sweet, malty, with just a slight hint of spice.  Tastewise, it's mildly sweet, yeasty, malty, and lightly spiced.  Very well-balanced.  It's got a big body -- definitely for sipping, not for gulping.

552,"2003-02-14",2.8,"UPDATED: NOV 21, 2011 Feb, 2003 Soft as duck down and twice as tasty. The alcohol monster sneaks up on crepe soled shoes to slap you around the head after a while - but by then you dont really care. The clove has lulled and numbed and whispered and you have either succumbed or complained. A strange and interesting brew. Take off your armour and let it seduce with its perfume. A warm and attractive beer that suffers from expectation. It aint the worlds best, but it is damn good. [3.4]
Nov, 2005 Yeasty fudge, varnish, paint and raw mushroom aroma with some burnt sugar and alcohol. Mostly chalky dry (yet sweet) with muddy spices, chocolate liquor,  some clove, a pleasant sudden sharp fruit just before the swallow, and lingering alcohol on the way down. Very late tobacco and toffee notes. Doesnt quite hold together. Light (almost thin) bodied, initially alcoholic and odd tasting, though with conditioning/aging the alcohol will mellow into a pleasant sweetness. [2.9]
May, 2006 Blind tasting:  Belgian aroma. Some chocolate. A touch of coffee. Yeasty. Bottle conditioned. Strong - 9%? Pleasant. Sweet, yet well attenuated / dry. [2.9]
May, 2011 This is a drinkable beer. It has pleasant parts, but doesnt exceed itself in any area. Hops are bittering rather than aromatic, and dont provide much interest other than a counterbalance to the sweetness. Palate is dry - chalky at times. Flavours are pleasant rather than exciting, interesting, special or unusual. Some yeasty notes. It is what it is, and its OK. [3.0] 
Nov, 2011 Part of the Nice Carrefour Belgian pack during the Nice-Cannes marathon week. I opened the bottle and allowed some of the carbonation to burn off during the night, but that still hasnt dramtically improved this beer. This is not really my cup of tea - the more I have it over the years the more I realise I dont really like it. Despite all the acclaim and interest, I dont think this a genuinely good quality beer. The ingredients are not top quality, and the beer, despite the evocative monestary connection, is made in a modern steel conical which reduces character. This might have been a great beer many years ago, before Chimay changed their production method, but today its a poor mix of poor quality ingredients including wheat starch, sugar and hop extract. I keep wanting to love it because of its history, but lets be honest here, this is a bad beer. [2.5]","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

The aroma is beaming with orange and nectarie and well as some spicey clean qualities. The taste begins with a definite fruity undertone. Grapefruit, orange and nectarine dance through my head. The ending finishes very bitterly and very dry..probably about my only markdown...a bit too much of a bittering of the palate.

552,"2002-10-18",4.2,"330 mL bottle BBF 2005. This one was very very smooth and lusciously fruity and had no earth mustiness in the aroma or flavour. Even the yeast dregs tasted real good.  It reminded me very much of a slightly milder version of and I still prefer it over the blue.
Third rating: 8/24/2002: 3.9This time we rated two different  750 mL bottles, one was a use by 2002 and the other was use by 2004. Both were quite different to my previous 2 ratings (see below which were in 330 mL bottles). The 2002 750 bottle demonstrated the peat aroma and flavour that others have reported but I have not found in the 330s. The 2004 750 had no earth but strong cured meat, celery and chicken noodle soup character about it. The overall smoothness was also missing from both  750s compared to the 330s. Maybe storage is an issue here. Needs further research - a vertical rating even perhaps? 
Second rating: 8/9/2002: 4.3 Its good to have a beer like this right in the middle of rating a whole load of average stuff. It really helps you appreciate a good beer  like this and puts the rest in perspective. Everything in my original rating still stands - this is an excellent beer: Original rating: 22/6/02: 4.3 Faint hazy deep red-brown with large creamy tan lasting head. Very faint aromas when cold. When warmer, fruity hops, caramel, malt and light farmyard and doughy yeasts. Medium bodied and wonderfully smooth velvety well balanced bitter-sweet-alcohol palate from start to finish, some woody flavours in there as well. Lighter flavoured than both the Blue or White but still a great beer in its own right. I think I prefer it over both the Blue or White. Generally under rated and gains points because I could drink 3-4 of these at a sitting quite easily.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","OlJuntan64"

Straightforward flavors of white grape, cantaloupe, fig, and slick cherry-like malt.  Only the slightest hint of toastiness in the mostly hop/yeast finish.

ORIGINAL RATING: This is my least favorite of the three chimays, but that isnt necessarily a bad thing!  Hints of nuts, slight fruitiness, and a little bit of a woody flavor make this a delightfully complex beer.  Maybe it was just the bottle I had, but the finish seemed a little off.","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"

552,"2002-08-20",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 14, 2007 Lightly sweet, spicy, fruity aroma.  Deep brick-red color, very much opaque and unfiltered (bottle swirled).  Balance is amazing in this beer, the profile is overall, malty, but there is a very nice, spicy hop bitterness that follows right along.  Flavor progression is very meandering and almost artistic.  Finish goes on for a day and a half, and it has a very intriguing orange-spice aftertaste.  Carbonation, head, and lace are all there.  Body is medium-full.  Excellent!","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

Nose has that smell thats the same in the La Trappe beers; its like the taste of suger in the raw if you took away the sweetness. Maybe its from the sugar they use to start fermentation. Some very faint citric qualities to the smell with some other vague fruitiness. Im not sure how many people here have done this or have this weed, but chew on the bottom end of a stalk of Y grass (peel away the secondary leaves and chew on the white bottom). Its a flavor that very similar to one of those in this beer. Flavor it with a little bit of red grapes, minus the sweetness, with the faintest hint of alcohol and youve got the flavor nailed.

552,"2002-03-19",3.7,"A heftly bottle of this was my introduction to Beerpagne.  This brew pours a dark murky
hazel caramel.  The large frothy mostly diminishing head is off-white with virtually no
lacing.  The moderate nose is a complex mix of moderate grain, hay, caramel, grass, resin,
citrus, earth, raisin, vanilla, cola, and alcohol.  The flavor is balanced with a light start
featuring sweetness acidity, and bitterness.  The long finish is also balanced with
everything from the start being moderate with an addition of vanilla, caramel, anise,
pepper, and lemon/lime citrus tones.  The palate is the only glaring weak point in my
opinion.  The body is light to medium, the texture is dry, and the finish has a strong
astringency combined with a metallic texture.  The problem for me here is the excessive
carbonation that I can only compare to cheap champagne.  It really ruined the experience
for me.  A good brew that would be beyond stellar if the bubbles would be halved.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"

552,"2001-05-12",2.7,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2004 cloudy reddish-brown colour with a big creamy head, malt and haye aroma with notes of banana, creamy mouthfeel, medium-bodied, oily with a touch of acidity, slightly overcarbonated, dry and moderately malty finish - unremarkable; this is just the shadow of this was before:  this stuff is now highly overrated !","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"
552,"2001-04-30",4.8,"Beautiful reddish-caramel color with a smooth fruity aroma. Warms all the way down with alcohol reminder in your mouth. Its never overwhelming with just the right amount flavor and bitterness. Spicey sweetness builds the more you drink with none of the cidery notes that the white label carries. This is truly the Champagne of Beers. Those monks out did themselves!","Lancaster, California, USA","weeicemon"
552,"2001-04-13",4.5,"Dark coppery, cloudy color, with a moderately foamy head which lasts.  Big malt/spice nose.  Had a strong flavor, most of which were hard for me to put my finger on.  Spice, cider, fruity, with developing bitterness.  Hopefully someday Ill find a 750 to see if there are differences.","Portland, Maine, USA","Sammys"

Flavour starts sweet (apple pie, plum, raisin), picks up a bit of demerara accent, then turns more yeasty with a bit of dustiness and astringency late.  Alcohol comes in at the end to dry it up.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

552,"2000-04-26",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 10, 2004 This is my original rating corresponding to a 4.8 score and a somewhat naive palate: A nearly flawless beer.  One of my favorites of all time.
Appropriately cloudy and brownish red.
Fruity and spicy aroma.
Rich flavor - hints of apple cider
and other fruitiness.  
New rating, despite the warnings that this beer is on the decline it still has very far to go before it declines even into the ""merely good"" range.  A really nice combination of fruitiness with a dash of spicy phenols and a sourdough yeasty finish, very well balanced and even in the mouth.  Everything mixes well, nothing stands out, nothing is missing.  A bit fizzy.  It may not be a true 4.8 but its still one of the worlds great beers.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
