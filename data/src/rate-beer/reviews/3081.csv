3081,"2008-03-30",3.0,"Its just not my type of beer - it seems well done for the type. Sampler at Princeton. Reddish brown body with a wispy head. Oily texture and overall sausage taste really just turn me off. Smoky flavor is a different direction that the one I want to go with beer. Lightly hopped, which is a negative for me. Well crafted, but hard for me personally to enjoy.","Trenton, New Jersey, USA","lemasney"
3081,"2007-12-06",3.8,"Hand-bottle sent to me a while back from Dickinsonbeer.  Thanks Paul!  Murky amber colored body with a thin head.  Aroma is definitely smokey, but also has tinges of clove, anise, and yeast.  The taste is complex, following the aroma but also adding in flavors of banana and lemon zest.  Truly an interesting experience.","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"

3081,"2007-08-04",4.5,"I really enjoyed this type of beer. Poured hazy yellow with fluffy white head. Aroma of a BBQ. A smoky flavor throughout with some fruit hints. Very different and very good.","Hainesport, New Jersey, USA","johnadam2002"
3081,"2007-07-04",3.9,"This was a first for me at the Garden State Craft Brew Festival in June 2007.  Triumph Brewing was by far the best at the fest.","Pine Hill, New Jersey, USA","Solstice1222"
3081,"2007-04-14",3.7,"Hand-bottle thanks to Dickinsonbeer, sampled in Nov. 2006: Pours a slightly hazy copper bronze with a thin ring of lightly-lacing off-white head.  Great smoky wheaty banana clove aroma has good complexity.  Body starts lightly sweet and malted wheaty with a nice balance of mild German hops.  Palate is average, but could be a touch thicker.  Very true to style, however, and enjoyable.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3081,"2007-03-10",3.9,"growler at Dickinsonbeers on 1/20/07.  light tan head, clear golden amber color.  aroma is smoky bubblegum and a bit sour.  flavor is grassy malt, also gets a little bubblegum too.  tangy and a bit watery finish.  thanks, Paul!","Brooklyn, New York, USA","MullMan"
3081,"2006-11-27",4.1,"Poured a hazy amber color.  Huge smokey aroma that smells a like spent fireworks, but not in a bad way.  Flavor of smoke and bananas.  Light to medium bodyied.  Semi-dry finish with a hint of spice.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
3081,"2006-11-18",4.4,"12  oz handbottle, via Dickinsonbeer.  Pours a cloudy dark copper to orance colored body under a one finger foamy white head with great retention.  Aroma is just beautiful.  Images of smoky campfires, sausages, and bacon appear in my head.  Behind that, spicy wheat, fruity esters, and yeast peek out.  Flavor is well balanced between the smoke and fruity esters from the yeast.  More of a subdued smoke versus some of the German classics, but way beyond the usual American brewpubs efforts.  Finishes fairly dry.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a very soft well rounded almost creamy texture.  Pinpoint soft moderate carbonation is just perfect.  Overall, this was a pretty frickin awesome beer.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
3081,"2006-08-27",4.5,"30.07.06 Tap at New Hope, also brought growler home, also had the Princeton version 14.07.06 from a growler courtesy of egajdzis at BCTC.  These two versions are only similar, but each one was freaking fantastic.  I didnt take notes on the Princeton version, knowing that Id be having it again shortly in New Hope, but not realizing it would be a quite different beer.  Whatever, I loved them equally and will stand by my score as an amalgam of the two with notes on the NH version only.
The beer is a hazed dark amber color with small and fading tan head.  Aromas immediately waft and Im rapt by the woodsmoked sirens song.  The wonderful honey, clove, and banana notes do nothing to contradict the mission of the smoked malts, in fact enhancing the overall picture of the beer in such a beautiful way as Ive never before experienced.  Caramelized fruits abound on the palate as if lightly charred on a campfire stone.  The interplay of hefeweizen tartness with the natural acidity of the smoked malt is a wonderful dance.  I will say that the Princedton version leaned more heavily on the hefe yeast esters, while this New Hope concoction if more firmly rooted in its Bamberg soil.  The finish is predictably long as the sweet and smoke tickle the palate forever.  Even driving home I can still taste this beer and enjoy retronasal wafts of burnt beechwood.  Why, I beg, has this style of beer not been better explored!?","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
3081,"2006-08-20",3.9,"Tap at New Hope Loc.  Wheatloaf aroma with a touch of german bologna.  Hazy amber beer looking well treated and substantial, with a low head.  Tastes of cured meats, smoked cheese with lemon citrus stronger than the A.S.R. version. Modest palate, meaty mitty leathery feel.   Darn good, best beer they had on tap there.","Paleolithic, Pennsylvania, USA","xproudfoot"
3081,"2006-08-06",4.0,"12oz handbottled from New Hope and sent to me in a trade by Dickinsonbeer! - Thanks Paul! - Pours murky brown/amber with a nice white head that stays pretty well and laces the glass some.  Aroma is bannana, cloves, and some hickory smoke.  Flavor is nice and smoky and the flavor blends so well with the bannana and clove of the hefeweizen.  Wonderful flavor.  Body is light and airy and very smooth to drink.  Quite crisp and refreshing.  This is a fantastic and unique beer that Im very happy I got the chance to try!","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"

3081,"2006-07-31",4.0,"Pour is hazed pale yellowish brown with a thin bright white head....smell is smokey with a lot of banans...not as much smoke flavor, but yeast and clove...good indeed....","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
3081,"2006-07-27",4.1,"Draught pint at Triumph New Hope. Murky apricot-brown body with a velvety white head. Aroma has great beechwood smoke qualities like a campfire, plus citrusy esters and some fresh wheat as well. Retains a vague hint of sulfur, but that doesnt detract. Flavor is of medium, subdued smoke balanced by malted wheat and apparent yeast properties of clove and bubble gum plus some lightly tart acidity.  Also has a pleasant note of vanilla and is medium sweet with lingering, mouth-watering smokiness. Very smooth with nice palatable texture. Great beer, with a very appealing blend of characters.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
3081,"2006-07-15",4.2,"on tap in Princeton.  Aroma is banana, bready, and spicy, and a bit of smoke.  Taste is banana, clove, bready, spicy with a perfect amount of smoke throughout the palate.  Very good, took a growler home.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
3081,"2006-07-14",4.3,"Much thanks to egajdzis for this fine growler of nectar...
Appears a cloudy haze of light gold with a small white cap that slowly fades out. Tons of streaked lacing is left around the glass.
Smell is of crisp wheat, banana, clove, bubblegum, and subtle smokiness.
Taste is of the same aromas. Really delicious stuff and a fine hybrid mix that Ive never come accross before...Im glad I did now though.
Mouthfeel is light bodied, creamy, sweet up front.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"
3081,"2006-07-14",4.2,"Sampled from Growler, filled the day before, courtesy of egajdzis. Poured a deep and murky golden color with an averaged sized white head. Aromas of bananas, smoke (the smoke in the aroma came out more as the beer warmed up), bubble gum and spices. Tastes of wheat, smoke, bananas (both smoke & bananas lighter in the tastes than the aromas), and spices. The smoked aspect was done nicely (wasnt overpowering and worked well with everything else).","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
3081,"2006-07-13",4.2,"Thanks to egajdzis for sharing this growler from the Princeton location.  Pours a hazy golden, orange, brown...almost cider light in appearance with an average white fomany head.  Aroma of banana, bubblegum, wheat, light smoked meats, yeast and some various spices.  Flavor of smoked meats, wheat, lemon, banana, yeast. A nice smoked Hefe.  Only downside was it was a bit thin.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
3081,"2006-07-13",4.0,"egajdzis provides a growler, poured a cloudy gold, slightly darker than just gold, the head was a little thin for a wheat.  smells like banana and bubble yum.  flavor is smooth and sweet with the smoke sitting in the background.  i love when the smoke is more of a compliment than the major component, and this beer achieves this extremely well. banana, clove, bubblegum, and jsut a hint of smoke in the flavor make a smooth and slightly different brew.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","richlikebeer"
3081,"2006-07-08",4.0,"on tap-pours an offwhite head that laces with cloudy orange/brown color.  Aroma is banana cream, vanilla, malt.  Taste is smoked, banana cream, vanilla, clove, wheat, creamy.  Medium-full body.  Nice occasional beer.","Florida and, New Jersey, USA","jcwattsrugger"
3081,"2006-07-04",4.3,"Princeton - Looks like banana puree in a glass with a head.  Grain and smoke up front in the nose, hints of clove.  
Medium to heavy bodied, wheat malts hit you as hard as the smoke, but lighter than other smoked beers.  Superb balance of smoke to malt, then the banana comes through in the finish.  
Yet another reason to go to Triumph!","Eastampton, New Jersey, USA","Cornboy"
3081,"2006-07-04",3.9,"Growler at the HW open house. Cloudy yellow color with a small white head. I see others giving it a 4 or 5 for appearance but i thought it was one ugly ass beer! The good news is that is pretty much the only thing wrong with this beer. Aroma was light smoke, banana, cloves and wheat malt. Smoke is much more pronounced in the flavor, and it goes beautifully with the more traditional wheat beer flavors. Very refreshing beer on a day that was in the low 90s.","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","jimmack"
3081,"2006-07-03",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2007 Last HWOH from Growler.  Pours a very cloudy trubid, orange/yellow with an ok white head.  Aroma is wheaty, light banana and clove, lightly herbal with just a hint of smoke.  Smoke lucklily comes through a bit more in the flavor, and goes very well with the wheat, banana nd clove- similar to the Schlenkerla, but not quite as intense with the smoke.  Very smooth and easy to drink.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
3081,"2006-07-03",4.2,"Growler at Heavweight. Cloudy and golden in color with a nice sized off white head. Malty fruity and smokey nose. Banana and clove notes. Flavor is smokey and very nice.

3081,"2006-07-03",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 3, 2007 Poured a cloudy golden color with a medium sized, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of banana, caramel malts, clove and nuts, with subtle hints of smoked wood in the background.  Taste was refreshing like a nice German hefe, with banana, light clove and citrus fruits, with a really nice, smokey meat taste coming through strong.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
