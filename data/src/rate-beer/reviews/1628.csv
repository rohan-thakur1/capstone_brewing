1628,"2016-01-01",2.5,"This bottled Sake from a restaurant poured no head and a transparent clear colored body. The mild aroma was 0f polished rice. The vinous clean mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a strong vinous alcohol aftertaste. The ok flavor contained notes of nail polish, vinous alcohol and polished rice. A decent one but not one that I would consider drinking again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

1628,"2014-08-06",2.9,"Consumed cold. The appearance is clear, like slightly dirty water. The aroma is rice, boozy. The flavor is rice, fruit, booze, bubblegum. The finish is booze, hot, sweet. Medium, thin in body. Not bad. Could sip this on a warm night.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
1628,"2014-02-23",3.3,"This is my first foray into rating Sake, spontaneously decided to dabble in something different during my last trip to a Total Wine store. Its been about two years since I last tried a sake right after I turned 21, which at the time I had ignorantly dismissed as a monolithic experience. Having since been enlightened as to the variability of styles and flavors, as far as I can tell this seems to be a pleasant Junmai ginjo, or premium all-rice sake. Pours perfectly clear into a wine glass. Aroma is soft, floral, and fruity, with a hint of alcohol. Taste is melon and passionfruit, alcohol is masked well. Maybe a note of faint toasty bread in the flavor. I would enjoy this even more except I personally dislike melon flavors. Finishes very clean and neutral on the palate, Im no expert on this ""Sake Meter Value"" but seems to be in accordance with the zero value as labeled. Sweet without being sugary. Does not come across as boozy. An interesting re-introduction to the world of sake, next time I think I will try something more earthy and rustic than this example.","South Carolina, USA","eRock_2013"
1628,"2013-10-27",3.2,"Bottle, sampled chilled. Pours clear with no head. Aroma is floral and slightly citrus. Taste is the same. Slight alcohol warmth. Not bad.","Rockford, Illinois, USA","jmagnus87"

1628,"2011-11-26",2.7,"Enjoyed this warm sake while dining with a good friend for his 30th birthday celebration at Shinto in Naperville, IL.  First sake rating!  Appearance like water.  Aroma of rice and alcohol.  Taste of rice and alcohol.  I think Im turning japanese, I really think so.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"
1628,"2011-11-12",3.2,"Pours perfectly clear with a very pale yellow color. 

The aroma is fairly rice-y with some pear fruitiness, a good dose of booze and a little bit of butterscotch. 

The flavor has some passionfruit, spicy alcohol, & light berry flavors. Surprisingly enough (given the character of the aroma) there is not a lot of rice flavor in this. Over all its pretty dry. 
Enjoyable.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

1628,"2010-12-18",3.1,"Clear. Aroma is fairly fruity along with some rice and almond notes. The flavor is more of the same with some peach and cantaloupe notes. There is a little alcohol burn as well. Decent.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
1628,"2010-10-19",2.9,"Sampled at a Disney event. Pours clear and has some nice legs with a good swirl. Slight fruity melon, rice aroma. Taste has more fruit notes in the flavor and a touch of alcohol burn. Nothing too exciting about this Ginjo.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
1628,"2010-10-09",2.4,"110F pour that coats the cup somewhat with a swirl. Aroma of cooking apples, light vinous notes, ethanol and a hint of banana oil. Flavor is green apple skin, overripe banana, pine needles and gin spice. Fairly heavy body with a slick entry, slightly dry finish and noticeable, but acceptable ethanol burn. Meh, decently enjoyable I guess.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
1628,"2010-02-08",2.7,"served chilled.  A clear body aroma had a typical cucumber and alcohol aroma to it, with some perfume notes.  Flavor was a bit  on the sweet side and the body seemed to have a little thickness to it.  The finish was smooth.    Nothing special.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
1628,"2010-01-18",2.8,"Still being new to Sake, my palate was left searching.  Almost crystal clear in color, this drink had a very muted flavor with a light grain note, touch of wood, and a mild freshness.","Hamilton Twp., New Jersey, USA","NJBeerman013"

1628,"2008-04-16",2.0,"The aroma is ricy with alcohol. The appearance is clear. The flavor is like the aroma but strong. The palate is watery. Its one dimensional but not terrible.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1628,"2008-02-17",3.4,"Served chilled. Good stuff. The aroma is a bit subdued, but a bit of plum is detectable. Appearance is clear with a slight yellow tinge and decent legs. Taste shows a lack of sugar, but it is pretty well balanced. Alcohol is noticable. Lightly syrupy mouthfeel.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

1628,"2007-08-15",3.5,"I am starting to really get into Sake!

This drink has a very light aroma, some flower, some alcohol, faint whiffs of magic.

Hides the alcohol quite well, but it can hit you hard if you take to big of a sip...
good subtle flavours.

Overall, a very nice buy, has some burn to it but quite enjoyable!",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
1628,"2007-07-24",3.1,"Pours a oily transparent water. The aroma has a light fruitness. Oily texture, a bit flowery taste, sweet nutes, mellow, sweet. Pleasant.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
1628,"2007-04-28",3.3,"A clear appearance similar to pouring cooking oil in a glass. A sharp alcohol filled aroma with some bananas and coconut. The flavor has a bit of an alcohol edge with more bananas and coconuts showing through. A somewhat oily finish. Not a bad sake for this rookie.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
1628,"2007-04-03",1.9,"Well, it is pretty clear, and contains no obvious fungus.  However, the aroma would beg to differ.  I suspect this is what vomit would taste like if you added yeast. Perhaps Im just not a sake man, but this is unfathomably gross.","portland, Oregon, USA","Arayaga2"
1628,"2006-12-02",3.0,"LCBO vintages tasting- It pours an almost transparent clear liquid, with some legging. Aromas are rice/garss/hay with some fruitiness and pine. Flavours are subdued pine/grass, with fruit and rice/paper. A little harsh and boozey, and it is also like $20.00. I wontget it again, but glad I got to try it.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"
1628,"2006-06-25",2.9,"Despite its strong ABV, this is  fairly mild to drink.  It pours clear and slightly oily, the sake clinging to the sides of the glass.  The aroma is light and grassy with melons and a faint whiff of the alcohol.  Its warm an peppery on the tongue, tasting of melon, rice, and sweet grasses.  The alcohol does catch up as it settles.  Not bad.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? Wine & Spirits, Downers Grove, IL<font size=-1>","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
1628,"2006-05-02",3.1,"Clear and oily in appearance. Seeps down the sides of the glass. Koji in the nose with melons and a hint of rubbing alcohol. Flavor is fruity with the koji kick. Not as hot as the nose, though. Warms the belly, but smooth.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"
1628,"2006-04-26",3.5,"750ml bottle as pictured: Pours mostly clear, but with some light straw highlights that can be seen when held to a white background.  Legs are syrupy and thick, slow to fade and almost slip down the glass as one.  The aroma has some melon, melon rind, hints of coconut, and to me there is also some very light scents of earth and toasted sesame in the background.  The initial sip seems to be quite full bodied & syrupy, moreso than other sake that Ive tried.  Notes of earthy bitterness, almost feels lightly acidic at first, then some buttery coconut, melon, rice, bread, and the alcohol burn tends to come through a bit more than most towards the end.  The alcohol itself comes through with some spicy chocolate and pepper notes.  The finish has a bit of dried straw, dried & sweetened coconut, and some mexican chocolate.  Initially the alcohol burn turned me off, but after the first glass I really was able to get past the alcohol and appreciate some of the complex flavors here.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"
1628,"2006-01-29",3.1,"Pours clear.  Smells of rice and some non-descript fruit.  Taste is of rice and some apricots.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
1628,"2005-07-27",3.5,"Clear, thick syrupy legs. Nose of light creamy koji, some obligatory melon and coconut, a bit of alcohol. The flavor is earthy, some more alcohol burn and a bit of banana peel. Finishes balanced, decent. I found this to have a bit more alcohol compared to other Japanese Ginjos but still flavorful and balanced.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1628,"2005-02-13",3.6,"Bottle, served in a small tulip glass.  Inviscid, clear, tequila-like appearance.  Flowers and nail polish remover in the faint but curiously pleasant aroma.  Nice flavor - a very complex blend of rice, bread, and Goldschlager.  Smooth finish, I like.","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"
1628,"2004-02-16",2.8,"The aroma is sticky sweet with malts and alcohol.  In fact, the alcohol is quite present in the burning sensation down my throat too.  In the finish there is something mildly spicy and it reminds me of olives and wine.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
1628,"2004-02-16",3.2,"I have no yellow hue in my sample, it is perfectly clear - aroma is of rice, perfume, some alcohol, plant matter - pretty thin, with a subtle flavor - grassy? indeed - mellow sweetness, some buttery qualities, esp. near the end - alcohol is evident, but not overwhelming - I'm not quite a sake convert yet, but I would drink this again.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
1628,"2004-01-30",2.7,"Slight yellowish hue yet not as yellow as the Hakutsuru Sake I had the other day.  Strong aroma of rice and paper (quite distinctive!).  The mouthfeel isn't all that thick or rich, yet Black and Gold is not a dry sake.  The alcohol burn is considerably harsher than for other Japanese Ginjos, but less than what you'd find in a cheap Junmai Regular or Futsu-Shu.  Although there are some nice grassy qualities to this sake, its color is the most alarming part that makes you think it needs more refinement to be a true Ginjo.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
