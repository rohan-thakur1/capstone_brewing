3105,"2015-07-18",4.2,"11.2 ounce bottle, bottled 25/9/14, best before 25/9/16. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and some chili peppers. The taste is mostly just like the aroma, but theres the addition of some maple and smoked malt/meats. However, those flavors arent strong at all. Dont get me wrong, its a tasty brew. But the maple and bacon/smoked meat flavors are subtle, and the chili pepper flavor is just a little stronger in comparison. Mouthfeel/body is medium, its creamy and coating with a good amount of carbonation. Overall I thought it was a good stout, and its definitely worth trying. Just dont expect a lot of maple, chili and bacon flavor out of it. If you look at this brew as being a good imperial stout (and dont pay attention to the maple, chili and bacon on the label), then youll like it as much as I did. $7.99 a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

330 ml bottle [BBE:25/09/16] 
Blood alc: 41 mg/100ml 

Pours very dark brown to black with a lovely big pouffey cappuccino/latté head. Smells like coffee primarily with a damped boozy note and a rich tang, possibly coming from the dry bacon salt. 
The taste experience is layered but fast with coffee bitterness being almost exclusively present at first, leading into a bacony salt sensation and leaving the saltiness as it fades in tandem with the bacon flavour. Theres some deep roasty notes going on somewhere in the middle. 
Honestly this is a great beer and Im excited to follow Buxtons story as theyve got some great ideas and they really know how to pull off bizarre flavours but this one was a bit too burnt and roasty for me, making it quite hard to fully appreciate the more unique flavours which I think are going on in here. I couldnt detect any spice unfortunately and Im not a fan of coffee in beers as I think the green (as I perceive it) bitterness it imparts is usually quite unpleasant. Im not certain that coffee was used from information I have but Im pretty sure based on the flavour. I like a good gimmick, and this definitely qualifies - but Ill always compare their beer to the wonder which was yellow belly - a stout which tasted miraculously just like peanut butter (except not having the effect of making me gag), and that is a heavy bar to raise...

3105,"2014-12-15",3.3,"10th December 2014Tasting at Leightons Flat. Thanks to Leighton for procuring. Opaque dark brown beer, big pale tan head. Mellow dark malts on the nose and a whisper of bacon! Palate is airy and semi dry with mild fine carbonation. Airy dark malts, little cream. Savoury notes mix with dark fruits, traces of bacon follow the nose. Turns bitterish before an airy finish. Bitter linger. Interesting but could not drink a lot of this.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"

3105,"2014-11-11",3.8,"Tap. Port Street Beer House, Manchester. Just about black. Thinnest halo of tan, for a head. Soft smoke. Wet leather. Soft, treacly, dark fruit. A bit reserved, really. Taste is when this comes alive. Its smoky sweet. Roast dry, turning savoury, and light bitter. Add to that a subtle chilli burn. Lovely stuff. I suspect the subdued aroma is due, in part, to the fact its a bit cold.","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"
