2769,"2007-03-23",3.2,"Bottled (BB 03/2008)
Clear dark amber color, small vanishing tan head. Very lively beer, coming out of bottle by force. Caramelly and buttery aroma with woody Bohemian-like hops and hints of iron. Caramelly flavor but not overly sweet - more like dry and bitterish. Light roastiness (toasted rye bread) and tinkling  hops in the aftertaste. Easy going Vienna, good brew in its style as their superb black lager.","Pori, FINLAND","TBone"

2769,"2007-03-20",3.3,"Bottled. Dark amber colour with big beige foamy head. Toffeeish, caramellish, metallic and fruity aroma. Flavour is fruity hops and mild roasted notes. Some sweet malts dominate the whole thing. Refreshing and quite pleasant.","Vasa, FINLAND","oh6gdx"
2769,"2007-03-19",3.2,"(Bottled) Clear dark ruby-brown with a small, mostly fading head. Toffee-caramely-malty, slightly metallic aroma with slight roastiness. Mildly roasty and sour, sweetish, toffee-malty flavor with medium bitterness. Velvety-smooth, medium-bodied palate with soft carbonation. A very easily drinkable, yet reasonably tasty brew.

2769,"2007-02-16",3.0,"From a narrow neck slender 330 ml. bottle with a coded freshness date on the back label.

Poured a clear reddish amber with a foamy, bubbly topped off-white head that settled into a thin, slightly sudsy lacing.

Aromas of plums and raisins, a subtle nutty banana, floral and sweet caramel bready.

Good moderate carbonation and a softly crisp, smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel.

I read on the website that this brewery has its own well, a unique water source, and from the lagers Ive tried from this brewer, I believe it, a subtle mineral quality to go along with fresh plum fruitiness, caramelized sugery, a light toasted graininess, with a metallic edge to the malts, a soft earthy spiciness, and a malty, metallic finish.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"

2769,"2006-11-12",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2008 Labled as Bohemian Granát Lager
Pours brilliantly clear, deep amber brown color and is topped by an initially three-finger thick, creamed amber colored head.  A predominantly dry aroma, with perhaps a touch of caramelized malt character.  This smells like Munich malt, lightly toasted and lots of chewy melanoids.  The aroma is quite nice, though it is fairly subtle.  Aromatic notes of toffee become noticeable at times as well.

Malty sweet, not cloying, but laden with complex sugars that run the gamut from caramelized through to just lightly roasted.  The finish has a drying character, contributed by light roast notes & predominantly toasted notes, that makes you want to take another sip to get back to the up front complex malt sugars.  Nicely bitter, though not so much do take away from the dominant malt character.  The bitterness, in combination with the carbonation, adds a bit of a spritziness to this beer.  Also in the finish the hop bitterness and toasted malt notes seem to combine to give an almost tannic character.  Spicy hop notes are also here, but play a subservient role to the malt character.  This is a really nice beer, it just drinks so smoothly.  It has enough of a body to accentuate the chewy malt character, but is still light enough to be perfectly quaffable.  I am quite impressed, this beer is definitely hitting the spot right now.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2769,"2006-11-11",2.9,"UPDATED: NOV 14, 2006 Beautiful amber color, and a fluffy beige head. Sweet, malty aroma. Initial flavor is semi-sweet toffee, followed by nut and coffee. If it were a little less sweet, I would give it a higher rating. Very nice carbonation.","USA","DJC"

2769,"2005-05-19",3.3,"On handpump at the Shakespeares Head (JDW), Kingsway. very nice clear burnished bronze colour, with a hint of red. Im not sure Id call it ruby. The aroma has an almost Belgian quality - sticky hops, sweet malt and that cahracter I always associate with ""candi sugar"" (I know its not actually candi sugar, but I know whqat I mean). Toffee, caramel and lots more sweet malt in the flavour. Very mellow. There are some hops skulking about, but their impact is not great until they give just a little kick on the finish. Interesting, but a bit too sweet for my taste without anything to provide balancing bite.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
