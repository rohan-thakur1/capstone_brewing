4554,"2016-08-31",2.7,"Draught at Barcade, 8/26/16.Clear, light golden with a touch of copper and a small, white head that shows low retention.Light grassiness and minor herbal character shows low to moderate hoppiness, with quite a bit more malt adding spongecake, vanilla and whitebread. Clean, no alcohol but a bit too much maltiness, being rather sweet/bready so not even all that enjoyable (I have nothing against malt-forward pilsners, provided the malt is done well). Really not much else going on....Again, rather dominated by the malt portion, with plentiful breadiness and sweet honey. Expectedly, the saaz hops arent a tour de force of flavor and bitterness, but somethings gotta give here, because the beer ends up just too sweet/mushy. Had this been even a bit more dry, it would have come off far more balanced and drinkable. As is, its not particularly easy to even finish a pint of it. Otherwise, it is clean and there is no alcohol.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4554,"2016-07-29",3.3,"On Tap at BitterCreek Alehouse another slightly hazy pale yellow lager. Nice bitter soapy spicy hop note carrying a soft malt base. Light beer with still some decent flavor.","Boise, Idaho, USA","IndianaRed"
4554,"2016-04-24",3.8,"Pours straw yellow with a one finger white head with nice lacing. Aroma is of pils malts, grassy hops, some herbal hops, bready malts, light sweet malts, and some light pine. Taste is about the same as the aroma. Has a medium-light body with a semi creamy mouthfeel and a semi dry, semi bitter, medium-long finish. Overall, a tasty, refreshing, easy drinking pils.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","skmikeg"
4554,"2015-09-05",3.8,"Tap. Xfinity Live. PSU vs Temple. Poured a slightly hazy yellow gold body with a small fizzy white head. The nose is dry bready malt and a clean crisp hoppiness. The flavor is much the same, very clean and dry with a crisp and sharp bitterness that lingers nicely. A little more body than their usual Pils. Light to medium bodied with soft fizzy carbonation. Pretty great beer, about what I expect from a Victory lager.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

 Served on tap in a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer is served a clear golden straw color with a fizzy one finger white head. The head fades rather rapidly leaving a light level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is a mix of some biscuit and a bit of lemon and earthiness. Along with these smells are some lighter notes of grain and some caramel sweetness.

 Taste  The taste starts out with a blend of a biscuit malt and a bit of caramel sweetness. As the taste advances a small amount of a pear and apricot fruit flavor join the taste sweetening the brew ever so slightly with a little bit of a grapefruit hop coming along to balance out the aforementioned increase in sweetness. A tiny bit of a yeast and spice and some grassy hop join the flavors at the end to leave a clean and crisp taste on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer was on the thinner side overall with a carbonation level that was average to slightly above average. Both were quite appropriate for the style and made for a rather refreshing brew overall.

 Overall  Quite easy drinking and rather refreshing. Nothing too out of the ordinary but nice none the less.","","Darkmagus82"

4554,"2013-07-19",3.3,"On tap at Dutchs. Clear yellow color. Thin white head. Few loose splotches of lace. Good clean bready aroma, lightly peppery, no off-flavors. Satisfying, but not intrusive amount of hops. Light hint of lemon citrus. Smooth, crisp, lighter carbonation. Slightly dry in the finish. Light to medium body. Moderate sweet taste, light bitter. Tasty, well-done pilsener. Victory knows pilseners. This is up to their standard.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
4554,"2013-07-13",3.8,"Lightest gold, totally transparent, head dies like Smaragd but more effervescent. Light bubblegum esters at beginning of nose, oily pine c notes. flavor starts estery, but warmth dries it, more grass and victory grain husks through short finish. Lighty resinous for victory, lacking in richness of their best lagers, reminiscent of prima with a stronger, more resinous hop finish.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
