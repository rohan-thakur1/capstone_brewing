2234,"2017-02-26",3.1,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is very oxidized with lots of sherry character. Light funk and acidity. 
The cord on this was warped and slid right out with almost no friction. Pours a copper reddish color with a faint, forced head. 
Flavor has moderate acidity with hints of citrus and quite a bit of sweetness. Some red apple and tons of sherry notes. Faint funk, but its really not super present. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with no carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a bad beer; well, a bad bottle. Both of the previous bottles I have opened have been way better. The cork in this one looks like it was pushed out and then resettled. So much oxidation.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

2234,"2015-08-02",3.8,"(750ml 2008 bottle @ Delirium Cafe, July 27th 2015) Pours fairly clear iced tea colour with a small head of big bubbles and no lace. Aroma is like a hybrid of Flanders bruin and barley wine, sweet and tart with lots of dried fruit, especially prunes and figs and sweet grapes, fortified wine notes (moscatel or tawny port) give a vinous feel, fairly oxidized, oak and a slightly sulphurous funk in the background. On the palate, not nearly as sweet, with a big component of acetic acid for a lambic. Oxidized, moderately funky, crabapple and golden raisins, hints of caramel. Funk towards the finish, some sulphur, hint of mint, oaky. Light bodied with carb almost all gone. I think this had got a little past it (and perhaps not the best venue for handling...), nose promised more but the oxidation had got to the palate. Still quite interesting, would have been even better in slightly nicer condition.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

2234,"2014-10-14",4.2,"Specialty lambic from the winter of 2010 - 2011. Bottled faro is a weird concept to me which I usually associate with oversweetened, blended beers like Lindemans Faro, but when 3 Fonteinen does it, I put all my trust in it. Justly so, it turned out. The lambic used for this contains not only unmalted wheat and pale malts, but malted wheat, Munich malt and amber malt as well, very unusual for the style. What makes this a special faro instead of a special geuze, is of course the addition of candi sugar. Thin but stable head, warm orangey amber colour, misty. Complex, powerful aroma of lively fruity esters as in any good lambic, mandarin, fresh grape juice, sherry, hay, wood, lemon, cider, apple peel, caramel, candi sugar, toasted bread. Complex taste with a whole array of flavours the ardent lambic lover adores, including lactic acid, fresh citric acid, wine vinegar, sherry, wood, as well as an honest candi sugar sweetishness in the finish, a tea-like aspect and a long, dry finish of tannins, funkiness and tartness. Absolutely lovely.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2234,"2012-11-18",4.7,"75 cl. fles gedeeld met  Sebletitje tijdens de Belgian Ratebeer Winter Gathering of Ultimate Evil. Gekocht tijdens de opendeurdagen bij de brouwerij. Dit is veel ouder dan ik initieel gedacht had, gebotteld op 25/01/2008 dus dit is al 4 bijna 5 jaar oud, nog leuker dit is houdbaar tot 01/2012 dus dit is eigenlijk al vervallen :) Dit smaakt eigenlijk als 4 jaar oude gebottelde 3F Faro (wat eigenlijk best wel heel indrukwekend is). Ik ben dol op hun Faro, enige echt  fenomenale faro een van de hel, heel weinige goede faros wat nog altijd niet echt een stijl is wat mij betreft :) Donker extreem wazig amber met weinig in de weg van witte kraag. Geur is een iets lichtere zoetheid, zoete boerderijen, hooi, bruine en kandijsuiker, lichte funk. Dit heeft dezelfde prachtige zoetheid als de vat versie, bijna een oude hop toets, zoete boerderijen, hooi, bruiden en kandijsuiker, overjaars fruiit, zoete sinaasappelschil, karamel, toffee, lichte aarde, Vol, zeker voor de stijl maar minder vol dan de vat versie, mogelijk de leeftijd, iets minder gas dan gewoonlijk.

2234,"2012-11-09",3.7,"Bottle. First pour is a beautiful crystal clear slightly pinkish tinged amber body with a small fizzy off-white head that faded to a thin ring and thin covering. The nose is a really wonderful mix of funky Gueuze and slightly sweet sugar. Not quite as funky as the Cantillon or regular Drie Fonteinen Faro. Seem cleaner and brighter somehow, quite a contradiction for a Lambic really.  The flavor has quite a nice balance to it as well, funky cellar and traditional Lambic up front but then a good bit of sweetness towards the back end. Theres a nice almost citrusy quality on the finish, reminds me a bit of a nice tart glass of fresh lemonade for a second. This is easily the finest bottled Faro that Ive had, but not quite as rustic and raw as the Cantillon and regular Drie Fontenein. The mouthfeel differs quite a bit as well, with this being much sharper and with much more lively carbonation. On the whole though, this is about as authentic as you can get while being able to enjoy it at home and from a bottle.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

The beer is dark yellow and slightly hazy, with a small head that leaves virtually no lacing behind. The aroma brings sugar, with a mild funk. Personally, I would never choose a faro over a gueuze, as I much prefer sour to sweet when it comes to beer. That being said, this is the best faro I have yet had, though my experience in this genre is quite limited. The beer is lightly sweet, and still brings a helping of funk, albeit muted by the sugary presence. A decent beer and a fun experience, I would have this again.

2234,"2011-09-08",3.9,"750ml bottle, packaged 01/24/08, best by 01/12, consumed 01/11.  Wow, this stuff is different.  Ive really never had anything like it.  The pour yields a very lightly hazy, dark honey colored body.  A small beige film is conjured up, separating to a thin, lasting ring.  Skinny, delicate flares and trailing micro spot lace dot the glass.  The nose is truly distinct, drawing from the lambic component to show notes of apricot, tart, buggy wood, pithy orange and lemon acidity.  Brett is distinct, and there is a farmy horseblanket funk to it.   Where it gets odd (not necessarily in a bad way, just in a different way) is in the baseline notes of fermented out rock candy and mild cola malt, as well as in the hint of white grape skin.  Somehow, the combo works for me.  Its not like any faro Ive ever had, and as I understand it, thats not exactly what it is anyway.  Flavors are a bit more funky and sour, touching on apricot, tart lemon, grapefruit, and tangerine, also showing wet, soured wood and dry, buggy brett.  The residual candy sugar background note is less prominent, but it still plays a major contributing role.  The palate sports a tingly, lively, drying carbonation up front, showing just a bit of dried out residual sugars on the back end.  Overall, this is quite an interesting brew.  I didnt quite know what to make of it at first, but its 3F lambic roots show big enough, especially in the flavor, to keep this sourhead happy.  Great brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

This beer is starting to show some of the same nutty oxidative qualities along with tart citrus fruits, a bit of caramel, green bell pepper, and oaky vanilla and cinnamon.  The flavor is lightly sweet up front, moving to the more acidic citrus notes accompanied by the same oxidative nuttiness starting to set in along with the oaky vanilla and cinnamon.

Light sugary character along with a moderate amount of Brett funk. Its profile is pretty similar to 3F Oude Gueuze, but a bit subdued. Flavor is nice with a bit of apple and barnyard funk.

A: Orangish-red bpdy. Very thin off-white head. A nice thin skim remains on top as soapy lacing is left behind.

S: Alternating blasts of oak and tart berry-like aromas. Some lactic funk and lemon runs underneath. Some nice sweaty aromas as well.

T: Similar to the nose as a nice blend of wood, funk, sourness, tartness, sweat, and some berry. A bit unusual, but quite nice.

M: Silky smooth body. I think more carbonation would have been a nice addition. The sourness/tartness is a bit timid, but is still quite noticeable.

O: A very nice, refreshing lambic. Interesting and unique. Will have to track down more bottles soon","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
2234,"2011-03-17",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Dusty funk dominates this simple Lambic until a lemony undercurrent washes the tongue with sustained tartness. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam surfs the murky dark amber.
-Alcohol is a no-show in the flavor profile.
-The docile effervescence increased drinkability.
-This was not nearly as complex as most Drie Fonteinen offerings, but it is still an interesting creation the likes of which we rarely get to taste on this side of the beer world.

2234,"2011-02-26",4.3,"Poured for me by Armand in a sampler glass while talking about his brewery. Nice guy, who makes great beer. Visit his place if you are ever around Brussels, or make a trip just to go there. Its worth it. But bring enough money, we walked out spending way more than we thought we would. 
Pours a golden straw with a hefty sized white head. The head stuck around the whole time. Which really wasnt long as I had the small ~6 oz. glass down in about a minute. 
Great lambic scent of grass, funk, wheat and sourness. 
Not as sour as some of his other beers, but balanced well with the sweetness it offers. Same smells came back as taste, especially the wheat and sourness. Great balance of everything, but the wheat, sourness, and sweetness really shine. 
Carbonation mellows out any strong alcohol you expect to be there with an 8 abv on the label. That and it is just so well balance by the slight sweetness you get and the sour feeling you get typical of a lambic. 
Very drinkable despite the high abv. I had to constantly turn down samplers due to my 2 hour drive home. But if I had the time I definitely would have stuck around to drink more. Good thing I got a few bottles to drink at the house. 

If you can get your hands on this gem, dont turn it down. And perhaps age a bit if you can wait. Excellent beer, excellent brewery, and an excellent brewer.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"

2234,"2011-01-03",4.0,"750 ml Bottle.  Pours a slightly hazed woody amber red with no head- although some slight very soft carbonation at first, then it seems mostly still.  Aroma is funky lambic like brett and sourness, cherry pit, mineral, cherry pie, rustic woody, earthy with dirt, light horse, kind of a cross between flemish red and lambic.  Flavor is earthy mineral, lambic upfront, lacto sourness, slight citrus, medium citrusy funk, lemon, then turns to cherry pit, light vinegar, woody, burnt caramelized (well fermented out) malts, fully fermented caramelized candy sugar, and a big sour finish which seemed a nice blend and mix of different tart acids- lactic, tartaric and acetic (though none are too sharp).  Mid-palate trace of sweetness, but it is mostly just a good sour beer wihtout any real evidence candy sugar was ever added either in brewing, fermentation or afterwards which leads me to say this is unlike any other Faro ever since it is not sweet at all.  Wihtout knowing how this was made myself, I have to tell myself this is leaning mostly towards what a great Flemish red is like, maybe mixed in with a strong lambic for some added funk and lactic acidity.  Faro?  no.  I still really liked this beer- nothing offensive, and just a whole lot better than I expected (thinking it would be sweet- which it wasnt at all).

Sweetish-sourish taste, with the sourness much milder than that of your typical oude geuze and balanced by clearly present caramel. Alcohol warmth and gentle spiciness keep cosily smouldering over the smooth and dense texture. Cannot stop recalling hot wine, so I decided to warm a bit of this stuff up. It resulted in a milky-caramel aroma and a taste still possessing sourness and citrus as well as a good texture, barnyard being gone.

2234,"2010-10-30",3.7,"A: The pour is quite dark, an amber sort of color with a fair amount of brown notes. The head is rather large and off-white in color.

S: The nose is only mildly funky, for a Drie Fonteinen beer, anyway. A very slight hint of their usual sweaty sock aroma along with some grass and earth. Quite a bit of sweet candi sugar like aroma, which I was not expecting at all. And there are lots of fruit notes to this beer as well.

T: A fairly aggressive grassy quality comes through on the palate, as well as some straw. The tartness is there, but only a slight lactic/lemon character to the beer overall. Again, the fruity sweetness shows itself, but it provides a very interesting contrast.

M: The body is medium, perhaps what you might expect for a ""lambic"". The carbonation is soft, but present enough.

D: If nothing else, an interesting experiment in fermentation. I would be interested to see how this beer develops over time.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

2234,"2010-10-25",3.7,"January 25th, 2008 Bottling Date, Best by January 2012; Sampled October 2010
A soft pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a two-finger thick, lightly amber-tinged, tan colored head. The beer is a dark amber color that shows a hazed (despite sitting in the fridge for a month or two), plum, light amber with gold highlighted hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells tart and fruity up front and really reminds me of plums with a caramelized apple backdrop to it. There is a certain mustiness to it as well as some damp, barnyard aged, musky cloth blanket notes, perhaps a touch of phenolics / acetone and a certain spiciness that I cant quite tell if it comes from acetic acid or not. I poured some for my wife in a 25cl tulip glass and a note of overly-ripe cheese and perhaps a touch of rotting fruit aromatics even, or is that a rotting vegetable like note (baby puke even :-).

Dry tasting up front, but quite carbonated, though it doesnt get very fizzy as the body of this brew is quite thick (at least if you were expecting something Lambic like in texture). Woody oak notes and a touch of spiciness show the barrel influence. This is actually quite dry, which is quite a shock if you were to believe the Faro designation this has been getting; there is not much of any residual sugar as all the Candi-sugar has been fermented out completely. The darker malts used (the label mentions Munich malt and amber malt) add some nice malt character to the finish; it is subtle underneath the more dominant Lambic-like character, but provides finishing touches of biscuit-like malt, a touch of toasty whole grain character as well as a chewy brown bread crumb (crumb being the part of the bread inside the crust and not crumbled dried bread) notes. Nicely tart tasting, but it is not nearly as bracingly tart as one would expect from a regular strength Lambic (extra alcohol does tend to inhibit lactic acid production) and the acidity couples with some phenolic notes to produce some light spiciness in the finish that intermingles with the spicy oak notes. A touch of vanillin character is contributed by the oak aging and maybe even a hint of coconut. I do like the texture of this beer, the ample, but not over-whelming carbonation mixes quite well with the medium texture that has a certain creaminess to it. Perhaps a hint of sweetness comes through as this warms up, but really it comes through as a boost to the fruitiness rather than as an actual sweetness; notes of plum, fragrant apples (like Macintosh) and perhaps a hint of caramelized melon are just barely noticeable.

This is not in the least a Faro, and was badly characterized as such as a beer brewed with Candi-sugar that has been fermented is entirely different than one sweetened by such for serving; this is made even more ridiculous when you consider this was bottled in 2008 and released in 2010, you could never reasonably do this with a Faro. This is not over-carbonated yet, and I dont really see this being a future problem for this beer; there is very little residual sugar left here and I would guess that this will age gracefully well past the January 2012 best by date. This is a nice alternative to a lighter Lambic / Gueuze, definitely a bit more appropriate for the winter time, though this is certainly not heavy, but I am not sure that I would ever choose this over a more traditional Lambic. Worthwhile as an experiment, but I cant see myself stocking up on this particular batch; with the variation between batches and given this is a first time thing, if future batches took a different turn than this has it might be worth picking up those; I wouldnt mind if there was more lactic acidity and perhaps even more character from the darker malt or even the candi-sugar.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

That said, this is a very dark gueuze...kind of an amber.  I actually get some alcohol on the nose which isnt common for the style.  Cork popped nicely but its not as lively as I was expecting.  The beer poured with little head.

There is a lot of barrel character on this beer.  

The more the beer opens up it shows the genius of the blend.   The slight sweetness keeps the higher alcohol and woodiness in balance.
