3503,"2016-12-19",3.3,"On tap @Bir&Fud (Rome). Bruna scura, impenetrabile, schiuma color beige, mediamente persistente. Al naso sentori tostati ed erbacei, caffè verde, cannella, frutta rossa. In bocca è molto ben equilibrata, dolciastra con finale amaro corretto, ma forse un po pretenziosa, stucchevole alla lunga, non lascia il segno. Corpo medio, carbonazione corretta. Così così...","Rome, ITALY","Mortlach"

3503,"2016-09-04",3.6,"Cask  Huge cream-coloured head over black beer with a redbrown sheen. (Blood)oranges, red fruit, raspberry(jam); intense even through the huge head. Dark malts, dry hops, fruit only in the finish/background. Very slowly, raspberry announces itself. Sweetness is there too, but the hops, as well as the dark dryish malts, keep it tempered. Light body but slick. Typical cask carbonation. The raspberry is just a tad too jam-like. For the rest, this is an outstanding blendbeer.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
3503,"2016-09-03",4.1,"Draft @ ML Fontainas, Italian Beer Wknd #5. 
Couleur brune foncée, sur un voile presque acajou-pourpre, col crémeux blanc-cassé.
Arôme au nez complexe alternant sur des notes fruitées noires, rappelant la mûre et un malté plutôt cara pâle et une sorte dherbacé en infusion arrivant en rétro nasal.
Palais est malté, léger rappelant une infusion de thé noir avec une présence fruitée noire voire même de baies. Le tout est léger et très surprenant, tirant sur la framboise et la mûre. Pointe de grillé, accompagnement herbacé toujours ponctué par le fruité noire.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
