1313,"2014-12-09",3.4,"Bottle. This beer pours a fairly dark brown color that turns a rich shade of ruby when put to the light. A tall head of light tan forms atop the beer as well. Very pretty.

The aroma on this was a little weak. Grainy and dusty smelling with perhaps a latent sweetness.

The flavor however is much better than the aroma. Lots of lovely sweet notes and caramel malts come through. It is a smooth and slick sweetness that blends well with the surrounding grains and malts. Light bitterness on the finish with just the slightest amount of tingle over the palate.

While I’ll admit I wasn’t much into the aroma, the flavor really came through in a big way. Very tasty.

1313,"2014-10-29",3.5,"Ive been looking for a good Scottish Ale for years it seems. This one very drinkable. Color right to style, very low carbonation, good. Flavor is nicely balanced malt-hops-peaty-smoke... they got that right. Only negative may be the water... hence the dissappearing act of any lacing. Other than that, perfectly drinkable and a pleasing mouthy finish. Very drinkable compared to a lot of Scottish ales where you may need a roaring fire and a view of some kind of slope ((; / yah maan.","Plano, Texas, USA","rdsanfbeerman"
