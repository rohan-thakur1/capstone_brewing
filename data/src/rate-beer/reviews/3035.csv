A végtelen mélységek, mennyei magasságok itala, ha létezik tökéletes karakter, ez közel áll ahhoz, a tejszínesen bársonyos krémesség lepelként takarja be és csendesíti le a kirobbanni készülő ízjegyeket, amellett, hogy az élénkség is a jellemvonásai között tüntethető fel a szerkezetnek. Mézédesen vibráló gabonaszirup egy cseppnyi fanyar, élesztős hálóba burkolva, melyhez a komló aromásabb, vadságától megfosztott, érettebb jellegű hangulata is csatlakozik, ezek a jegyek azonban csak tökéletes aláfestésként szolgálnak a whiskey játékához, ami magára von minden figyelmet. Az érlelésnek az a fajta testet öltése ez, amikor a fahordós jegyek nem csak úgy rátelepszenek, semmint inkább beleivódnak az ital lényébe, lelket adnak a karakternek.
