2017,"2013-12-26",4.0,"Picked up on growler Tuesday at the brewery! Big brown pour with a huge thick off white head. Wonderful peppermint aroma with notes of chocolate. Nice brown ale malt body with chocolate and lots of peppermint in the taste. A truly perfect Christmas beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
2017,"2013-03-10",3.7,"Chocolate and mint on the nose, light dry roast. Pours brown with no head. Really nice chocolate and mint flavors with a little roast. FInishes a little thin but leaves something to be desired.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2017,"2012-03-11",4.0,"Ryan shared this a while back, poured a dark brown color, aromas of the traditional oatmeal rasin cookie but with mint add to it.  Flavor is the same, exactly like an Annies mint real nice beer.","Florida, USA","burg326"
2017,"2011-12-21",3.7,"Entering old rates. Jan 11 and Dec 09. Bière légère pour la saison festive. Brune, avec col léger beige. Arôme rappelant un peu la  Maduro avec une dose fraîche de menthe. Je ne suis pas spécialement un amateur de menthe dans tout ce qui est chocolat, mais je dois dire que ici, cette bière se boit facilement. Garde un côté Noël avec épices américaines et de pain dépice. Le tout sur un malt grillé et caramel.  Agréable surtout que on ne ressent pas ce fini frais menthol de pastille à la menthe.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
2017,"2011-07-26",3.8,"Growler from the brewery. Pours amber with a off white head. Nose is roasty, caramel, oats and mint.
Mint more evident in the flavor profile. Very nice, clean and refreshing. Glad I got to taste this one.","Florida, USA","rbrazell"
2017,"2011-06-11",3.7,"Dark brown color. Aroma is sweet, some chocolate and light mint. Flavor has a bit more almost cooling mint but more as it warms. Up front just malty sweetness and chocolate and some nuttyness.","Kingston, New York, USA","yobdoog"
2017,"2011-01-14",3.4,"Growler pour.  Thanks to jwattsrugger.  A dark brown pour with light head.  Nice Monty notes.  Very enjoyable.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","hbmason"
2017,"2011-01-08",3.6,"tap at Blind Tiger as candycane lane - bit too sweet, some light  chocolate, oatmeal raisin. mint only comes out after it warms up. doesnt taste all that different than the maduro though. still tasty.","New York, New York, USA","zdk"
2017,"2011-01-08",3.7,"Growler from dodbeerigos. Pours dark brown tiny head. Aroma is girl scout thin mint cookies. Taste is fresh mint upfront then finishes with a nice roastiness and some herbal notes. Very good for a mint beer. Very different.

2017,"2011-01-05",3.5,"On tap at cigar city. not bad but it is what it is. Maduro with mint added to it. Aroma was pleasant and the taste wasnt bad but the palate on the maduro series leaves alot to be desired. a decent brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","steelcitybrew"
2017,"2010-12-26",3.7,"Tap at BT.  Pours a mostly clear deep brown with athin head.  Aroma is mint chocolate candies, andes dinner mints, toasty dry earthy nutty chocolate.  Flavor is more mint chocolate chips, thin mint cookeis, light pine, leather in the finish with some light tootsie roll and nuts in the end.  Drying though and easy drinking.  Ok.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
2017,"2010-12-15",3.5,"Draft.  Pours a bruin body with an off white head and light head retention.  More maduro and a very weak treatment no mint or peppermint in the aroma.  More nutty, malty, coffee tones.  Body seemed oddly a bit thinner almost a hint of grain, maybe i was dehydrated.  A light sweetness in the finish, mint.  My least favorite of the maduro treatments.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
2017,"2010-11-23",3.7,"Tap at Blind Tiger.
Amber brown with a little bit of off-white head. Aromas of roasty malts, chocolate, along with some faint peppermint notes. Medium to lighter bodied with a smooth, malty finish. Complex and quite enjoyable.","New York, New York, USA","murphym45"
2017,"2010-11-20",3.7,"Tap at Blind Tiger. Dark brown pour with an amber hue and nice beige lacing. I dont know; contrary to the consensus around the table, I was with, I sensed a decent amount of mint, although not in the candycane form. Instead, this was a beer form of an Andes after dinner mint. Aroma of dark chocolate dinner mints with a roasty background. Dinner mint flavor. Dark chocolate finish with a touch of minty coolness. Cool and refreshing. I should have saved this until the end of the evening.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","italarican"
2017,"2010-11-18",3.8,"On tap at the Blind Tiger during their Cigar City event.  Pours a just clear ruby brown.  Coffee and caramel on the nose, oatmeal cookies.  We got into some big conversations about this beer as most of us couldnt find the mint on the nose (it did show up a little bit as the beer warmed, but I was really expecting over the top mint, mint chocolate ice cream or something to that effect), and it was quite reminiscent of the incredibly oatmeal raisin cookie treatment of the Maduro. Malty sweet oatmeal, cocoa and just the fainest hints of some minty menthol in here.  Still tasty, but I was hoping for more candy cane.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
2017,"2010-07-04",3.4,"Handbottle thanks to Dave! Pours a brown color with a small white head. The aroma was sweet chocolate, mint and a sour note. The flavor is similar; definitely like a andes chocolate mint, lots of chocolate and mint, a strong sour flavor that is probably not intended. Pretty nice. Unusual, but it works.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
2017,"2010-02-19",3.9,"500 ml euro swing top bottle courtesy of bvc and ibrew2or3; pours clear light brown with faint bubble white head; lovely mint leaf nose with chocolate and dried wild flowers; soft, chocolate mint flavors that are reminiscent of those thin chocolates that sandwich a layer of green mint; ymmm, chocolate candy mints are spot on; texture is quite thin and I think this would be great with a heavy beer (porter or light stout maybe), so I hope more mint beers are down the road","Seattle, Washington, USA","SuzyGreenberg"
2017,"2010-02-15",3.9,"Growler shared by the Tampa Crew. Maybe this was just because this was my first mint beer, but damn, this was good!  Most everyone noted that it tasted just like an Andes chocolate mint.  Nothing too heavy here or over the top.  Just refreshing and fun.  Somewhat surprised they pulled it off.  Wonder if there are any other good examples of this style... mmm....","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"
2017,"2010-02-14",3.7,"This one was one of my faves from the dozens of CCB brews shared by the generous Tampa Crew. There was something about the dry qualities of the base beer, which had a nice subtle hop quality to it, that lent itself really nicely to the mint treatments. In fact, it tasted just like an Andes Creme de Menthe in beer form, though there was somehow nothing cloying or excessively sweet about it. And it certainly went over well in the midst of some heavies.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
2017,"2010-02-08",3.4,"Pours a copper brown with a one finger light tan head. The nose is minty, some caramel, grain, toasted malt, chocolate. Flavor is toasted/caramel malt, mint, a bit grainy.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
2017,"2010-02-08",3.6,"Thanks to the Tampa crew for sharing.  Brown pour with an off white head.  Aroma is cocoa and fresh peppermint.  Body is slightly thin.  Flavor is roasty and subtle hints of mint.  A Nice unique offering","raleigh, North Carolina, USA","ucusty"
2017,"2010-02-01",3.3,"On draft at CCB.  Im just not a fan of mint flavored things, though.  The mint was more subtle than I would have imagined, but still too far gone for me.  Just a personal preference, as there really isnt anything wrong with the beer from a crafting stance.  Minty and roasty.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"
2017,"2010-01-31",3.3,"thanks bvc! Cocoa and wintergreen aroma, Very light bodied, like a whisper. little dark chocolate and graham cracker. mint was fresh on the nose, more artificial on the palate.","Bothell, Washington, USA","scrizzz"
2017,"2010-01-31",3.7,"15oz flip top from ibrew2or3...thanks Dave!   Rootbeer brown and clear with tight off white head.  Nose is heavy on the mint with nutty caramel chocolate malt, interesting.

2017,"2010-01-17",4.0,"Appearance: Pours out a clear, medium brown body with a foamy, lasting, light ecru-colored head.

Smell: Engaging choco-mint combo in the nose with supporting notes of roasted grains, mild coffee, and even some hot chocolate mix.

Taste: Chocolaty, roasty malts with an added bonus of blackened grains and plenty of deep earthy tones to it. Then, theres the mint, which, thankfully, is well blended into the taste. Phew! Ill admit, I feared the combination could be disastrous. Light bitterness which seems to come more from the roast than anything else. All in all, its reminiscient of those lil Andes Crème de Menthe candies.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Lightly creamy mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Surprisingly good! For me, when it comes to beverages, a little mint can go a looong way. Fortunately, I found it to be just right.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
2017,"2010-01-16",4.4,"32oz Growler.  Amazing aroma of Thin Mint Cookies.  Brown color, tan head.  Nice roast.  Cool mint.  Chocolate cookie.  I dont want the fresh mint taste out of my mouth!","Georgia, USA","unclemattie"
2017,"2010-01-11",4.0,"Handbottle at our last tasting thanks to illidurit.   Dark brown with a small head.   Big mint-chocolate candy sweet aroma.   The flavor is medium-sweet and has a big mint-chocolate finish.   Medium bodied with lower carbonation, which was to be expected.   Very minty stuff, but the combination with the cocoa is killer and not overwhelming despite its intensity.   This bottle showed a touch of oxidation, which you cant really blame it for though.   Looking past that, a pretty killer minty brown ale that I would love fresh on tap.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"
2017,"2010-01-09",3.8,"Hand bottle shared by illidurit at a tasting.  Thanks, David!  Pours a somewhat cloudy dirt-brown color with minimal head and lacing.  Aroma is chocolate, herbal notes, spices, and lots of mint.  Flavor is chocolate and caramel, gingerbread cookies, and intense peppermint.  Really tastes great.  Carbonation is low, possibly due to the packaging.  Nice palate, medium bodied and very smooth.  An interesting beer and another solid one from the king of brown ales, Cigar City.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
2017,"2010-01-09",3.8,"Handbottle courtesy gunhaver. Pours a dark amber-brown with no head. Aroma is dark chocolate (but not too dark) and peppermint. Flavor is tannic but not really astringent. Leafy tea influence, dark chocolate and dark bread crusts. Aftertaste like those chocolate peppermints you sometimes get at a restaurant. Interesting and tasty, drinkable.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
2017,"2010-01-04",3.9,"Growler from CCB.  Pours Maduro Brown with an off-white head.  Nose is mint, malt, mild tobacco leveled by pepper/spearmint and some sugar.

2017,"2010-01-03",3.9,"Pours mahogany with edges of dark ruby and nice light tan head leaving some spotty lacing. The aroma has a mix of minty peppermint, a touch of nuttiness and roast achieving a modest non mint candy sort of smell. Interesting. The taste begins with a moderate amount of roast, nuttiness and chocolate. It then picks up a pleasing mint note from about midway and building somewhat into the finish. Wow, nice treatment with a refreshing and pleasing mint going on for minutes into the aftertaste.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

2017,"2009-12-23",3.8,"Growler Clear dirty-orange ale with a small, creamy, off-white head. Good retention. The aroma is a fantastic marriage of After Eight Thin Mints and Ginger Snaps. Medium-bodied with expired carbonation. The flavor is minty and chocolaty, but a bit thin. Plenty of bitterness as an afterthought. The lengthy finish is minty, moderately bitter, and then dry. Thanks to Degarth for providing the growler!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2017,"2009-12-21",4.1,"This beer sounded horrible when I heard about it but man was I wrong. The beer pours just like regular Maduro but the aroma is insaine on this one. This beer smells and tastes like Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookies. Aboslutely wonderfull.","Florida, USA","afterglow"
