3673,"2013-01-27",4.4,"Cask at The Hanging Bat.
Black & not much else in the glass but then appearances are deceiving. So are beginnings because to the eye it seems to be medium bodied. But from the moment it hits the mouth it powers out from the core a rich full bodies and beautifully fully integrated knitted complex. beer of some smoke, peat, velvet & roast with rich smooth earth & chocolate. And the alcohol is totally tamed.

Without doubt the best Old Engine Oil ever released.","SCOTLAND","zimbo"

The nose is rich dark chocolate, bitter cacao and charred malts. Wood, ash. The taste is wonderfully rich, sludgy dark chocolate. Burnt toast and mineral. Slightly salty wood. Awesomely thick body, wonderful vitality. This beer drinks very well considering its profile, and wears the chunky ABV effortlessly. Overall, a pretty stellar effort. Wow.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
