3474,"2017-06-16",4.5,"750 mL bottle. Originally reviewed from notes on 7/5/2012. Back when I had even less of an idea of what I was talking about. As always, its the blackest of stouts. Small dark mocha head. Chocolate ring around the top of the beer. Stains the glass as I swirl it.

Smells of chocolate, rum, coffee, barrel notes of wood and vanilla. Slight spice from the chilies. Awesome, even though I dont love rum barrels. Tastes of sweet rum flavors up front and then the chilies. The chocolate and chilies blend perfectly. The barrel adds a hint of char, vanilla, molasses, and toffee. The sweeter flavors are kicked up just a bit in this variant. Thick and chewy. Low carbonation. Tingly booze. Very slow drinking. Extremely complex. Delicious, but over the top. Again, its tough to compare. Theres always something lost and something gained this these Hunahpu variations.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

The nose is less peppery than the base, moderate cocoa, vanilla, and spices, with the Rum barrel being very visible like the other barrel treatments. Everything ends up working very well together with this. The flavor is thick malty goodness with moderate sweetness and some roast. The chocolate is a blend of creamy and dark versions. The rum adds a complexity not found in the original. Vanilla, pepper and spices round things out. Medium-full bodied and quite smooth. The barrel notes are well integrated with the base beer. Tried the rum that was originally in the barrel alongside the beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"

3474,"2012-12-07",4.4,"Barrel-Aged Hunahpus tasting! Thanks to all the guys in the tasting group who helped make this happen.

The beer is, like all of the Hunahpus variants, profoundly dark. Ominous black with a thick, oily beige head. An awesome appearance for an imperial stout. Lacing stains the glass.

The aroma brings a slightly sweet booze quality, though its hard to pin it down as rum. Oak comes through as well. The aroma is more complex and well balanced than either the whiskey or bourbon variants. 

Really nice flavor. Oh yeah, I like this one. Just an ever so slightly sweetness, with lingering rum and oak flavors. Fantastic.

Similar feel as the other variants: fairly low carbonation, silky smooth. 

Overall, outstanding. My favorite of the Hunahpus variants. Highly recommended.

3474,"2012-11-24",4.4,"Appearance:
Pitch black with only a meager layer of espresso crema to keep it covered in the still night air. Light doesnt penetrate. A thin collar and layer but no lace. Oily.

Nose:
Black licorice, black root. Cinnamon sticks, caramel, turtles, and truffles. Dried black cherries, prunes, and raisins rum soaked dark chocolate.

Palate:
Sweet dark fruits lead into a hot spicy finish  you can def feel the alcohol heat from both the beer and the rum barrels. Earthen and nutty. More cracked peppercorn and heat tingles the back of the throat as melted caramel coats. Maple and apple flambé. Silky, oily, and dense while remaining surprisingly light of body.

Final Thoughts:
Dark decadent rich oily goodness. Many thanks are owed to Joey R for so generously sending me a bottle of this limited brew along with a few other special treats. Cigar City is beyond the homering now  they are legit, here to stay, and arent going to hold anything back in the process.

3474,"2012-10-20",3.9,"750 ml waxed bottle served in a Deschutes snifter. Huge thanks to Andrew (nasty31) for the share. I prefer fresh Huna to aged Huna, but that being said I thought the Bourbon barrel aged version was stupendous so I had high hopes for this one as well.

A: Pours a dark black with a viscous body. A dark mocha head forms on the pour and recedes to a thick, bubbly ring. Sticky sheets of lace are left behind.

S: Fruity rum booziness up front with dark and sweet milk chocolate flavors. Slight figs and roasted malts as well.

T: Oaky body with roasted malts. The rum is barely noticeable, just some faint hints of it. Nice light chocolate presence as well.

M: Meidum carbonation with smooth and creamy medium to heavy body. The finish is malty and sweet.

O: While this was good I was struggling to pick out some of the bolder barrel notes in the taste. It seems the base has swallowed up most the discernable Rum barrel flavorings. I would gladly take a fresh Huna or the Bourbon Barrel version of this any day.

The aroma is boozy rum and sweet coconut followed by boozy heat that rolls right into dark chocolate and highly roasted maltiness. The taste is straight up yum with velvety smooth dark chocolate, rich dark roasted maltiness and moving into sweet smooth rum, vanilla and coconut. To midway yummy capsaicin chili pepper mildly warms the palate. Darn, velvety dark chocolate, sweet smooth rum and pepper chili heat all playing well together and snugging up to some sweet coconut. The barrel time is money for my taste and the rum only adds to the experience with increased smoothness and allows the amazing base beer shine. (Ok, up on soap box) After tasting this level of balance and harmony you realize how often this is executed so poorly at just about all breweries I can think of including this one. Once in a while a barrel treatment nails it on the head and the result is pure palate pleasing poetry. But it seems lots of barrel aged beers cover up base beer elements or entirely wipe them all out. Take note this is how you gracefully barrel age a beer.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
3474,"2012-02-04",4.1,"Tasted side-by-side with regular, Bourbon, Whiskey, and Virgin Oak. Thanks to everyone for making this happen. Served in a Cigar City snifter.

Pours a very deep brown color with a good light mocha head. Thin bits of lace and a nice collar on the way down. The nose carries a nice dose of rum and molasses plus strong Hunahpus base characteristics coming through. Really great integration between the spirit and the chiles, vanilla, and cinnamon. Really complex, and that continues through the flavor. Very chewy and viscous with low-ish carbonation. Absolutely delicious. Boom.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
3474,"2012-01-29",5.0,"Bottle opened by Dak at Woodshed 1.0!  Ridiculous how amazing this beer is!  Jet black pour that stains the glass with a burnt caramel head that left spotty lacing.  An explosion of intense flavors bombard the senses with rich molasses, vanilla, oak, cinnamon sticks, chili, brownie batter, and fudge all present.  Had the whisky barrel after and it seems to hide or muddle the other flavors.  Every aspect of Hunahpu is accentuated and shines through.  Thick and luxurious...this one definitely deserves the score!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
3474,"2012-01-22",5.0,"OMG. Black. Dark brown head. Aroma is chocolate, vanilla, cocoa, chiles, booze.  Flavor is rich and amazing. Rum, cocoa, cinnamon, fucking amazing. Wow. Wow. Wow.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
3474,"2012-01-06",4.5,"Bottle, to quote Hopscotch, this beer Rocks!!! Big thick black pour, coats the glass in a sick way. Huge barrel vanilla and rum, with notes of chocolate and roasted grain all popping through in the aroma. Thick chewy body with lots of chocolate, roasted grain, vanilla and hints of rum poking through in the taste. A decadent a tasty beverage.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
3474,"2011-12-21",4.7,"Aroma: big dose of chocolate - the cocoa nibs really come through and work with the malt for a sweet, punchy cocoa nose.  Lots of caramel and dark sugars, plums and dates, also coffee.  The cinnamon and chilies are fairly pronounced, I dont get a lot of barrel character in the nose, very similar to standard Hunahpu - which isnt a bad thing.  Pours black, completely opaque with the consistency of motor oil, very faint tan head from an aggressive pour, but dissipates quickly.  Flavor generally follows the nose: tons of cocoa and dark chocolate, fairly sweet with some balance from  the hop and dark grain bitterness, caramel and molasses as well.  Very nice spice notes from the cinnamon, and a very pleasant heat from the chilies, all well balanced with nothing being particularly overwhelming.  The barrel notes are subtle - I do get a bit of rum, but it just adds a bit of complexity rather than stealing the show.  Roasty notes and plenty of coffee, warming alcohol, gets a bit boozy as it warms up.  Very viscous, coats the palate and lingers, carbonation is medium.  Fantastic brew - very well done.","Iowa, USA","ekoerper"

3474,"2011-12-17",3.7,"bottle... all look the same... the aroma is all rum, medium strength, a bit of oak a little chili... taste really brings out the chili, especially on the finish, overall is mostly just light sweet rum with a bit of chocolate, pretty solid","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
3474,"2011-12-04",4.1,"750 ml bottle from 50belair. Thanks! Pours a rich thick opaque black inky pour, thick and big with a dark brown head, cakes and laces ok. Aromas are rich and sweet rum, toffee and caramel mix, vanilla and spice, with touches of roast and toast but the Rum spirit seems to have taken hold here, cinnamon or Big Red gum comes in fairly full, some gentle pepper, but cinnamon shows up more here, pepper falls way back.. Some nuance of its spice treatment from the base than any of the others. Spice and pepper heat grows but rum barrel shows some bright light and power. Initial is rum barrel, vanilla and gentle spice, some good roast and toast gets a bit muted, sweet caramel, toffee, and gentle roast, cocoa, coffee. Rum barrel is quite pleasant but transforms the beer, vanilla and sweetness, some healthy spirit mixes with ancho pepper. Hard to decipher which is fusel and which is ancho. Decent touches of cinnamon dance in and out, I feel the actual pepper comes into play more here, but it is hard to determine if its fusel or ancho pepper. A growing heat, with good flavors, sweeter rum, spirit, roast, toast, sweet big malts. Very nice beer with lingering barrel, roast, dark cocoa, pepper spice, spirit, distinctly rum. Very nice. Prefer regular Hunah a little more. As far as whiskey compared to Rum, Rum held hommage to the base better (more base flavors come through), but Whiskey showed much better balance and was probably an overall better beer than Rum.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3474,"2011-12-03",4.1,"750ml bottle courtesy of adam. Thank you sir... Pours as deep as the rest with a viscous solid black stouty nature hued while topped with a solid dark tan head... Aroma of peppery char and deeper chocolate and a finalizing note of pepper.  Nicely maintains the original beer minus the cinammon outside of the pepper influence... Flavors are a continuation of the same with a dark fruit boozy component with pepper and vanilLa and perhaps a lighter cnammon note. Thicker bodied and nicely executed. Such a difference between these variants while the whiskey was somewha restrained while the flavor in the rum pops with booze and more maintaining the base. Gosh, slendid flavors but pretty hot and boozy.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
3474,"2011-11-30",4.4,"Bottle This beer rocks! Pours tar thick and black with a small, rusty-brown head. The deeply roasted, vinous aroma offers cinnamon, dark port, vanilla, tobacco and molasses, flanked by a rumor of pungent chili peppers. Full-bodied and fatty with soft carbonation. The flavor is acrid, burnt and bitter with notations of sugar plum, pouch tobacco and alcohol. Warming finish all the way down to my toes. Excellent!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3474,"2011-10-24",4.5,"Bottle from Cigar City release.  Pours an obsidian black with a dark tan head.  Nose is a remarkable amount of dark chocolate, rum, wood, vanilla, cinnamon, spice, tiny amount of slight pepper and smidges of booze.  Flavor is similar with lots of chocolate, some roast, bits of rum, bits of pepper, layers of flavor coming in waves.  Mouthfeel is pretty thick, although it competes with regular Hunahpu for the thickest stout.  All in all, another home run from CCB.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
3474,"2011-10-09",4.5,"Bottle.  Thanks to Cesar for sharing this bad boy.  Joan Jett black pour with a chocolate head.  Sweet fruity aromas.  The rum is very deceptive ( I could only pick it up in the nose) and adds more booze/whiskey notes.  This treatment had less of the traditional Hunahpus flavors than the others.  It is still a world class stout, but side by side with the other treatments, it is my least favorite.  That being said a couple of the other guys thought this was the best. ...","Florida, USA","50belair"
3474,"2011-09-27",4.2,"9/27/11. 750mL bottle. Pitch black pour with a big, frothy brown head that is by far the biggest of the treatments, but fades quickly and laces plenty. Boozy aroma that is much more one dimensional than the other treatments, but offers a unique spiciness as well. The flavor delivers much more - nice Hunahpu characteristics of chocolate, peppers, and vanilla, but theres a nice sweetness with pie spices and sweet sugars as well. Very nice, but I still liked the bourbon the best.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
3474,"2011-09-27",4.0,"Pour still huge thick molasses black beer with thin still super dark hard. Smell is a lot more ashy some vanilla a lot more spicy red pepper smell. Taste is a little bit more coppery pepper is more prevalent and deep molasses on the back end with a white pepper kick.","Florida, USA","scotchzi"
