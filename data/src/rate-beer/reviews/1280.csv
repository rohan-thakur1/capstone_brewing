1280,"2005-09-11",3.7,"Well I suppose Id better start getting around to inputting the ratings from my trip to Scandinavia, so here goes. On draught at Akkurat. Chestnut with a white head. Aroma was moerately sweet with a bit of nuttiness as well. However, the flavour profile was a mirror image of what the aroma would suggest. There was a thin malt presence and it was indeed very hoppy and bitter. This was my first ever Swedish beer and a very good introduction it was.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mutant"
1280,"2005-08-28",3.6,"An amber beer with a light brown head. The aroma is sweet with notes of caramel and hops. The flavor is hoppy - my guess is Goldings, which gives it a slight dusty flavor.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

Dark copper colour, rich firm head. Juicy grapefruity hop aroma. Sweet and richly malty, some cookie malt, near full bodied. The mouthfeel is on the clean side. Its very hoppy, but has sufficient malt to balance it. Very bitter finish.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
1280,"2005-02-17",3.2,"Keg @ The Ardbeg Room, StockholmDark brown colour. Served ice cold. After a few minutes of hand aided warm up one could find some malty aroma with a touch of black currant. Full bodied malt sweetness with a dry flowery finish. The long aftertaste gives away the probable use of a small dose of smoked malt in the mash. (Note to self: Check that with the brewer) It leaves you with a somewhat sticky sweetness on your lips. Scottish/american in style to me.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","MrWalker"
