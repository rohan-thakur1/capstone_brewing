3510,"2016-06-28",3.2,"Havent had too many milds to gauge, but Id say this is mix of a brown ale and ESB. Darker than I expected, with heavier and flavor and feel than I expected for only 4.4%. The typical caramel/chocolate malts, some sweet toffee...decent hop blend to give that bitter to balance out. This is one that I would sample again.","Winter Park, Florida, USA","Jabah"

Some nice toasted grains and bread. Light earthy quality and bitterness to go with the (understated) sweetness of the beer. Nice balance of malt and hop character and very easy to drink. Quite enjoyable.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3510,"2015-04-17",3.4,"Nice rendition of the style with plenty of flavor, despite being very light. FM seems to do these styles very well.
