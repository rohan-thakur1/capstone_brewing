Always on the lookout for a good Irish Red or malt-focused American Amber, which is my top sleeper style. And this was darn good.

3729,"2013-04-19",3.5,"Picked up a growler of this for Slutfest - but after the brown and Granite, no one was really excited to try it, and thus it went home with me.  Opened on Sunday.  Medium, clear red.  Aroma is bread, with some earthy hops.  Flavor is a match.  Quite reminiscent of Killians before it went to heck.  I well executed Irish red.  Didnt enjoy it as much as the Kolsch, but solid, and restored my faith in this new brewery after a couple of disappointments.  Wish I had brought this and the Kolsch instead of the brown and the granite!","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
3729,"2012-06-20",3.1,"Growler from the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy reddish-brown with a medium sized frothy head. Decent head retention. Aroma of toffee, apple and herbal hops. The taste is toasted malts, toffee, nutty notes, banana and and herbal finish. Medium bodied.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
3729,"2012-06-03",3.3,"Growler shared by Drake: pours a clear deep copper amber with a spotty-lacing off-white head.  Has a lightly toasted nutty malty nose with some mild grassy hops. Starts with average fullness and light malty sweetness with some toasty caramel malty sweetness and dry nutty character before a drier smooth bittersweet finish. Pretty drinkable, but nothing out of the ordinary.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3729,"2012-06-03",3.4,"Growler. Pours a deep ruby. Clear. Weak off white bubbles. Nose is sticky red fruits, toffee, malty. Mild spicy chocolate. Taste is sticky, dark cherry dessert, super malty. Palate is minerally and aerated. Okay.
