2283,"2017-06-22",3.7,"At De Republiek, Bruges. Pours hazy dark brown with a lasting, foamy, beige head. The aroma contains dark chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, caramel, spices and hops. It tastes light spicy and hoppy bitter, then medium to heavy sweet with a caramel accent. Medium body, oily texture, fizzy carbonation, light alcohol in the finish (which, for 11%, stille remains quite well hidden). A tasty brew, with elements of a Scotch; the carbonation could have been lower.","Brugge, BELGIUM","nathanvc"

2283,"2017-06-09",4.4,"0.33l bottle. Very dark ruby body with an enormous light brown head. Very complex brew. It has an intense tangerine character that I didnt expect at all supported by notes of raisins, orange zest, pepper, caramel and floral hops.

2283,"2017-04-11",5.0,"Sublime bière brune aux reflets rubis avec une belle mousse ivoire à bulles très fines. Nez extrêmement surprenant avec un parfum de fleurs en toute première intention : rose, illet, lavande, bergamote, verveine, jacinthe, géranium voir chèvrefeuille. Cest impressionnant et je nose pas imaginer la quantité desters aromatiques différents que doit posséder cette bière ! Mis à part pour la Kagua Japonaise, je nai pas senti ceci ailleurs. Derrière cette débauche olfactive, du fruit avec la fraise des bois, la banane, le litchi, la mangue, la passion, la goyave. A peine ressent-on les arômes de malts qui pourtant doivent bien être quelque part ! Lalcool me semble être bien puissant avec ses 11% abv étant donné quon le devine facilement. Passons à la dégustation pour vraiment voir ce que cette bière a sous le capot. Première gorgé, premier bilan : lalcool colle une belle gifle, la levure est fine, bien droite, une petite amertume se dégage tandis quon sent enfin les malts et les houblons. La texture est légèrement sèche, moins ronde que ce à quoi on pourrait sattendre alors que la carbonatation est vive et intense pour une Quadrupel. La deuxième gorgée nous démontre que lalcool est lossature de cette bière et soutient toutes les flaveurs. On retrouve en arrière-bouche et rétro-olfaction des arômes de prune, de mirabelle, de pomme et de poire. De petites notes acidulées viennent nous titiller et donnent un caractère citronné/pétillant pas bégueule sur ce breuvage qui est relativement sucré. Le final va sorienter sur les bois et le cuir, la cire et la résine, les herbes sèches et le champ de blé au soleil. En soxydant et en chauffant un peu, on retrouve un peu plus de rondeur et les flaveurs de malts ainsi que du fruit. Cest bon, riche, plein de corps, long, étonnant, aromatique, floral, alcoolisé... Une bière quon ne qualifiera pas de parfaite car la perfection nest pas de ce Monde (et on se ferait chier !), mais que faire mis à part décerner la meilleure des notes ?

Poezja dla moich kubków smakowych.

 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Bogaty smakowo, wybitnie słodowy, stylowy Quadrupel.
Stanowi ciakawą kompozycję nut słodkich (cukier trzcinowy, karmel, toffi) z owocowymi (ciemne winogrona, rodzynki, owoce kandyzowane).
Całość dopełnia czekolada deserowa i szczypta orzechów.
Alkohol subtelnie rozgrzewa, a piwo szybko znika ze szkła.

2283,"2016-03-27",4.0,"330 ml bottle bought at Gorgeous Wine & Cigar in Yuen Long.
Looks: Translucent Burgundy colour with a thin ring of yeast sediments; One finger head and crumpety light beige foam which lasts for 3 minutes; Beautiful sticky lacing with quite fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant and sweet dark malt, with light roastyness, almonds, strong caramel, sticky toffee, very light coffee, chocolate, cream, sugar, moderate alcohol, strong Bel yeast and light grass. 

Taste: Strong but pleasantly sweet dark malt, with moderate alcohol, light liquorices, plums, caramel, light toffee, Cola, chocolate, light coffee, sugar, strong Bel yeast, light lemon, moderate bitter hops and grass.

Body: Full body. Very creamy and slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Good dark maltyness in a rich, very smooth and silky background. Booze and sugar hit first but they do not scream nor warming, but rather in light touch and pleasant. Strong caramel mixed with Cola and light coffee. Quite yeasty and increasingly lemony to compliment the sweet booze. Its simple but the balancing work out just fine. Easy and nice!

Booze and Sweetness: The 11% abv is well hidden all the time, very well-managed and no knock on whatsoever. Incredible! Sweetness is strong but never cloying, as if its from chocolate bar. Very neat!

Hoppiness: Light grass in nose. Lemon and light grass in taste; Bitterness is fairly strong for a lasting, mid-astringent sweet booze finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Sweet, creamy and quite bitter to mouth.

Comments: Like its 9° Tripel brother, this Quad is simple in aroma and taste. Yet its foundation is rock solid, with beautiful looks and heads, very creamy body, very pleasant sweet malt, hidden booze and hoppy finish. It may not be as complex or colorful as La Trappe Quadrupel, but its very nice for chilling out. Recommended!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

2283,"2015-07-10",4.1,"Poured from bottle into a chalice glass
 Appearance- The beer pours a deep brownish color with a massive foamy cream colored head. The head has a fantastic level of retention, very slowly fading over time to leave a great showing of a foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma is big of a dark fruit nature with raisin, plum, and fig. These dark fruits are mixed with molasses as well as a burnt candied sugar aromas. Along with all these smells comes other aromas of yeast cake, which brings with it some spice of clove and coriander. The alcohol is not hidden in this nose with a nice rum aroma present which when mixed with the rest of the smells gives a rather rich and warming smell overall.
 Taste  The taste begins with a rather rich dark fruit flavor or raisin and plum mixed with the sugary molasses and caramel tastes that were in the nose. There is a rather decent bit of a breadiness that is present right from the start as well, with other flavors of yeast and spice of coriander soon following. The sugary flavors start losing ground as the taste advances however with them being replaced by some more roasty bread and some boozy flavors or a rum like nature. All the while a little bit of a woody taste and some flavors of chocolate develop on the tongue. With the mix of flavors that are left at the end, an almost spiced and roasty fruit cake like flavor is left on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is rather thin for an 11% abv quad with a carbonation level that was average. A little thicker of a body may have suited the fruitcake like flavors of the brew slightly better and keep it a slightly slower sipper (as it should be an 11%).
 Overall  This is a very tasty quad I must say. Other than the somewhat weak feel, it was really a fantastic beer to sip away. While not my favorite quad out there, I say definitely give it a try if you get a chance, as it is very good.","","Darkmagus82"

En aroma destaca la malta que nos recuerda a frutas oscuras y muy maduras como las uvas pasas y los dátiles y el lúpulo hace acto de presencia pero no destaca mucho y se mantiene en un segundo plano. En boca las caracter´siticas son muy similares aunque se potencian y aparece las notas alcohólicas aunque muy bien integradas, esto también ayuda a potenciar la sensación de amargor.

Another powerful pop when I removed the cage and cork. No spillage.

Lots of foam so Im waiting for that to settle down. Okay, it has a deep brown kind of mahogany colour to it, looks to be clear. The foam is off white bordering on tan. I see nice lacing.

I smell some sweet goodness. Caramel malt that fades into a port like nose that also has some fruity aromas going on. Thats not all; I get some notes of chocolate and some cherries. Some alcohol as well but its pretty well masked.

The taste is less sweet than I would have guessed. A port like flavour greets me at the door followed by toffee, figs, some cherries that add a mere hint of tartness. I also get more than a hint of the abv...lots of warming ensues. I wish more of the Port stood out but this is certainly tasty enough without that happening.

Despite the big pop on opening and the great looking foam I see after every pour, Id call the carbonation on the near delicate side.

2283,"2013-07-30",3.8,"De Straffe Hendrik Quadrupel was enige tijd geleden en ware verrijking, als trouwe aanhanger van ondernemer de La Trappe Quadrupel. Het aroma is vol en donker met geuren van karamel, candij en donker fruit. De hop toets volgt subtiel op het einde en de geur van de gist blijft in het aroma goed verborgen. Aan het uiterlijk merk je vooral aan de fijn bruisende schuimkraag en vooral de kleine explosies hierin dat je met een bier van zeer hoge gisting te maken hebt. De kleur van het bier zelf is donker bruin en vrijwel ondoorzichtig.
De smaak ligt in het verlengde van het aroma. Toetsen van gebrande candij, bitterheid van licht gezoete koffie mn met in de afdronk een lichte fruitige toets. Vooral in de smaak is het vleugje banaan, afkomstig van de gist prominent aanwezig.
Het mondgevoel is heerlijk, licht bruisend en sprankelend, doch klef genoeg om de nasmaak voldoende vast te houden.

2283,"2013-05-06",3.5,"In short: An Belgian Abt (fruity, etc.) that is more roasted than usual. Good.
How: Bottle 330ml.  Consumed approximately 6 months after purchase.
The look: Cloudy dark mahogany body topped by a medium fizzy dark-beige head quickly dissipating to a persistent layer of foam leaving lots of lacings on the glass.
In long: Nose is estery, raisin pie, overcooked dark fruits, burnt pasty.  Taste is burnt crusty raisin pie, crunchy roasted grains, Fig Newton cookies, a peppery spiciness, overcooked caramel, dehydrated prunes, black pepper spiciness, trappist-style yeast sensation.  No alcohol presence whatsoever which was nice.  Relatively low sweetness sensation for its style and size.  Generous carbonation, maybe a little too generous considering the body wasnt as full and rich as a 11% quad should be.  The beer has many characteristics of a typical abbey Quad except that it is more roasted, it felt as roasted as many roasted imperial stouts Ive had.  A good beer but just average for the style, although I was told more recent batches have improved, will eventually try again. And I just try to express my honest opinions here despite those people who say Im just an hypocrite who lies all the time, and I have the outmost respect for these people and wish them all the best.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The beer appears a dark maple brown color with a thick, dense, light beige head. Excellent retention and ample lacing. Quads are just great looking beers.

The aroma brings dark fruits, particularly plums, figs, raisins. Yeast presence is there as well. The aroma is a bit weak for the style.

Sweet raisins with a hint of yeast. Lingering bitterness in the finish. Caramel malt and toffee. 

Alcohol presence is very well disguised. A bit of warmth going down. Nice feel.

A good sipper. Not as complex as the Trappist examples of the style. Still, an enjoyable beer and worth a try.

Coming in the bottle. the correct glass was offered to me to pour my beer into; I did.

This is a dark, brooding brew: with a creamy head in both colour and texture.

The nose is all about malty molasses: so strong and sweet nothing else got a look in. Luckily the taste wasnt as sweet as the aromas suggested. The malts were certainly the dominant flavour but there is a hop bitterness stopping the beer becoming a malt smoothy and the alcohol doesnt hide away: it is very prominent once the beer has touched your lips.

Company from California. A bucolic corner of the Sonoma Valley for this
one, and the historical medieval city of Bruges for the other one...
But the most important is what you will find in your glass !!!
About the Straffe Hendrik quadruple, we have two things to say first : 
1. A member of the Belgian Family Brewers, and an old story beginning
in 1856 with the family Maes (not the one of the pils producer !!),
and a first mention of brewing in 1546 !!!
2. One of the rare belgian beers with the name of « quadruple », unusual
     in our vocabulary. I have also seen that beer qualified as a barley wine.
Let us see... First of all, a very high level : 11 % abv.
A very dark color, very encouraging...
Une mousse beige qui tient sur le liquide pendant la dégustation, mais à un 
niveau assez bas.
Des arômes superbes de grand brassin : prunes mûres, poire, dattes, figues,
et une pointe de joli porto vintage.
Première bouche magnifique sur les amandes, noisettes, pommes de terre,
petite pointe de coriandre et en arrière bouche lamertume dun bon houblon.
La seconde part sur des notes de cerises noires, de massepain, avec une 
pointe de cognac fins bois. 
On est clairement sur le plan dun barley wine, avec une complexité superbe.
La 3ème vient à une sorte déquilibre mais avec de nouvelles découvertes
gustatives, et en gardant une amertume plus importante que des bières 
brunes fortes dabbaye, qui sont dordinaire plus douces en bouche.
La levure est pourtant très douce, mais à mon avis, elle est en petite quantité
à la refermentation en bouteille, pour donner la priorité au houblon.
Bière originale donc, où on attend la longueur pour poser un diagnostic qui
sannonce chaud...
Dans la première partie de la finale, on a des accents de stout bien construit,
avec une sorte de charbon de bois qui passe très bien la rampe, et saccomode
des autres goûts comme dans un rêve...
Bière donc très structurée, qui révèle un caractère extraordinaire, avec une 
complexité de très grand niveau. On est au top, on le sait, reste la finale, un
très grand moment de tout dégustateur.
Cette finale, comme celle de la Cup en Angleterre, est un very very beautiful
moment... On va dire pour une bière, plutôt la finale du Superbowl....
Bref, vous choisissez selon vos affinités. 
Pour ma part, je reste avec la Straffe Hendrik quadruple, qui me fait la 
meilleure impression, et qui me confirme que nous avons tous les styles de
bière en Belgique, dont un barley wine qui fera très bonne figure..
Un conseil : try it, and after that you see a moonlight brewing in the sky...","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

2283,"2012-02-03",3.6,"Bottle.

Head is initially large, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting.
Body is medium to dark orange-brown.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (caramel, toasted nuts, roasted grain), lightly hoppy (flowers, apricot), lightly yeasty (cobwebs, basement), with notes of orange peel and coriander.

Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, velvety/watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

All in all better than expected.  The aroma is a bit mild and nothing more exciting than ""pleasant"", but it is indeed enjoyable.  And the mouth experience is quite pleasing considering the style.  All too often quads are hard to drink due to being too sweet and/or syrupy and/or alcoholic.  Or even sometimes too light and watery with some native Belgian examples where too much candy sugar is used in place of malt.  But this one is in a nice little sweet spot with respect to flavor balance and mouthfeel...its frighteningly quaffable but does not forsake body and malt richness, which is a rare quality.  Maybe just a tad watery, but all things considered it avoids the pitfalls inherent with the style well.  And on the tongue, the 11% seems much more like 8 or 9%.

6 Pleasantly rich and roasty malts in the aroma, a touch of treacle toffee, but alas theres some alcohol coming over too.
4 Deep reddy brown, but poured perfectly clear, initially a healthy light beige head, which settles to a ring, and finally disappears after maybe half an hour.
6 Full nettly retronasals, quite spicey and almost anaesthetic. Taste? Hmm, well, with the hops and the alchol this actually is anaesthetic - its hard to pinpoint details. General feel is that of a rich, slightly burnt roast, and earthy bitterness.
4 Smooth sweet palate, short of slick. OK carbonation. Mouthfeel as I hinted at in the taste is a little numbing, the hops are tingling, and the alcohol compounds that. Finish is a little yeasty and earthy at first. Its not unpleasant thought, and even has some coffee or burnt nutty aspects later (1-3 minutes after swallowing). 
13 Theyve pushed the boat out on the OG, and could have created a monster. Its just kept sane, and ends up being pretty tasty, but lacking any wow features. In some ways being this tasty at 11% is a bit of wow. Its the spiciness of the yeast combined with the biting bitterness of the hops and the, to me, high residual sugars that basically batters the booze into the ground and just says ""dont ask, dont tell"". Its only the fools who look at the label who will know the truth.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

But the further you drink, the more comes to the foreground: instead of malts you discover these are roasted malts, a caramel taste on the background, dark fruits are also coming to the foreground. The Quadrupel has the same specific taste as the Tripel (or you are fan who likes this taste or you arent), but has so much more to serve you. Excellent choice, this quadrupel! (btw: excellent beer for my 300th rating!)","Brugge, BELGIUM","wimpie133"
2283,"2010-09-12",3.9,"(Draught) Deep, dark ruby with a medium, creamy and lacy, beige head. Sweetish and dark-fruity nose with anise-clove spiciness. Flavor is anise-coriander-spicy with sweetish maltiness and brown sugar, and roasted malt in the finish. Alcohol is well hidden. Quite full-bodied, sticky and lightly syrupy palate with medium carbonation. The house flavor (that Im not a fan of) is definitely there, but there is so much else going on, that it is not disturbing. A quite well made and clean quad. 6437","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"
2283,"2010-09-12",2.9,"Draught  Beautiful garnet-red to brown beer with a dense, mango-yellow head. Chestnuts roasted with waffles syrup, and amandine/rosewater smell. Sweet, sweet, almondy and rosewater, perfumed. Seen the glacial serving temperature, the syrupy taste & feel must be horrifying warming up, but I have to admit to have passed that test. Sticky, syrupy, oversweet, powerful body. The serious alcoholcontent makes the perfumed overload to be nearly unpalatable. Ouch.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
