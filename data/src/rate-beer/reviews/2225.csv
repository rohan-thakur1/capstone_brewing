Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy medium amber (some protein break-out).

Aroma is moderately malty (toasted bread, caramel, cookie), lightly to moderately hoppy (flowers), lightly yeasty (cobwebs, basement), with notes of honey, tangerine, marmalade, pepper, light note of cardboard.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

Well, its definitely a bock sorta thing, stronger and sweeter than any kellerbier that Ive had (not sure why we list it as such here, might need a review).  But other than a small amount of oxidation starting to creep in, the nose is wonderful and reminiscent of the Saphir Bock (as far as the juicy-fruity-nectar-sugar-cookie thing goes, nice melanoidin succulence!).  Its a little too sweet for my tastes, but if its considered to be a bock its certainly not out of character.  Quite enjoyed the entire bottle.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

2225,"2013-01-08",2.0,"Speckled rust. Broken tiny-bubbled grayish head. Repelling nose of grape jelly, plum, bile, wort, and strong alcohol. Light note of pumpernickel bread, molasses, pecan and cardboard. Burning alcohol stings the palate as it fuses with overripe plum sugars to lend a medicinal effect. Note of cotton candy emerges to prolong the syrup-filled booziness. Sheer absence of malt definition does little to salvage the muddled body as what is left of the malt deposits an abundance of soggy bread and wort. None of the obligatory dry cookie edges, whatsoever. Some cardboard astringency in there as well. Finishes grapelike and medicinal with dabs of cardboard and tongue-numbing sugars. Ewwwwquite the trainwreck, with the dreaded grape character to make things worse. This certainly aint a kellerbier, so scroll on past if thats what youre expecting.

Flavour is sweet, yet dry in the finish, with sweet cereal grain up front, doughy malt, a tasteful amount of DMS throughout, and floral, herbal hops. A bit of heat is allowed to poke through in the finish as its so dry, as is a minerally note that reminds me of iron, which, if Im detecting this properly, is actually oxidized polypeptides, which seems unlikely.

Sweet wort flavor, rather like a beer that has gone through a decoction, faintly bock-like.  Balancing bitterness.  The hop presence I was detecting in the nose are totally absent in the flavor, making me think I wasnt really detecting them after all.  Just bitterness to counteract the rather full sweet body.

The aroma was rich, biscuity malt, light floral and spice hints, and a moderate, fruit sweetness. The flavor was similar and subtly dry into the finish.
