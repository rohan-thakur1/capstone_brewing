3133,"2017-06-11",4.2,"Bottle @ Mikes House. Big thanks to Mike! Lightly hazed golden straw colored beer with a finger of white head. This beer is just so typical of the Hill Farmstead farmhouse/saison character. Pleasant fruitiness of white grape (and wine), cantaloupe, honeydew, and soft citrus. Nice acidity of lemon and lime as well. Mild oak character, subtle funk, and a nice mineral/wet stone quality to it. Quite a nice offering.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3133,"2017-05-29",4.3,"Happy Anniversary Hill Farmstead! 375ml on Memorial Day with first firepit of the year. Also just spread the ashes of my fallen feline friends around the bird feeders and rock wall and decided it was only right to crack a Clover for the first time. Pours a medium golden color with a trace of white foam. Nose is wet oak, light stonefruit, melon rind, unripe pineapple, light appleskin. Palate follows the nose with a light saffron spice undertone that mingles nicely with the fruity stonefruit, musty grape and lingering minerality and quenching acidity. Hints of herbaceous floral fieldgrass are beautifully woven throughout the beers complexity holding everything in place nicely. Carbonation is soft leaving a round supple mouthfeel that dries out with the tart musty funk that lingers in the finish. Cheers to Clover, Irie, Merrimac and Oak.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
3133,"2017-05-10",4.7,"UPDATED: JUN 19, 2017 375mL bottle shared by Nelson on 4/13/17, thank you!!Brassy, pale-golden body shows good clarity. White head is initially full but falls to cover quickly.Smells tart. Lactic acidity with light Brett filling in the edges. Very Flora-like, with some Art in there, as well. Red wine, chalky, mild minerality and a long lactic finish. No alcohol or flaw. With warming, honey-vanilla notes emerge as the malt comes more to the front. Fruitier Brett notes help build complexity and take away some of the dominance of the lactic character.Quite a bit different in flavor than expected! White wine, kumquat and other strong tropical fruit from the Brett. And here I thought this was going to be heavy on the lactic acidity. But rather, thats very well-integrated and softened by the honey-like, rich malt character and instead theres a bevy of passion fruit, lime and hickory. Very engaging carbonation and Id consider it fairly sour overall, though certainly not heavily so. While the aroma is somewhat dominated by the lactic character, the flavor and texture more than make up for it. Every bit as enjoyable to drink as Art, Ann and Flora. Would love to try it side-by-side with those (like that will ever happen....).375mL bottle drunk 5/26/17 at the brewery.Drinking this alongside Ann and WoL Sante, which are probably my other two favorite sours from HF really helped put this thing in perspective.  First, its still quite young and actually maturing/benefiting from aging.  So thats encouraging.  Strong lactic character with lots of intense, rich oak and caramel-tinged honey-like maltiness is still a bit on the strong side, overall (though its still highly enjoyable).  Both the nose and flavors are woven tight and pack a very dense, rich wallop as white grape, kumquat and unripened pineapple/nectarine take quite a bit of time to breath and warm before opening up.  Much like a very young riesling or gruner.  I think this thing is really going to hit its stride in another year or two and probably be a real delight for many years to come.  I think it shows more potential than even 2014 Ann or WoL Sante.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3133,"2017-05-08",3.9,"375 ml bottle shared by JStax - thanks again, Jeremy! Pours a mostly clear gold with a small white head that settles into a ring. Notes of vanilla, oak, grapes, lemon, stone fruits, wine, and funk. Sweeter than expected, but still balanced. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation. Im not sure I like it as much as any of the component beers but its still really good.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3133,"2017-05-08",4.3,"500 ml bottle shared with phaleslu. The beer is a clear gold with a white head of foam. The aroma has wine notes, vanilla, oak, and a little citrus. Wine like tartness. Juicy and funky. Medium body and medium carbonation. A nice beer.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
3133,"2017-05-05",4.6,"Bottle, yup. Another incredibly complex and nuances barrel aged saison from HF. Lots of herbs, flavors, yogurt flavors. Berries, straw, hay. Incredibly complex, like a grand cru burgundy.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3133,"2017-04-27",4.4,"Poured from a bottle into a sample tulip: One of the best HF blends. Maybe the best. Pours hazy straw with a thin white head. Aroma of grapes, apple, floral notes, and oak. Taste is a little fruit sweetness, medium tart, a little bitterness from the yeasty funk, a little citrus. Soft and delicate, its near perfect. Light to medium body, nice carbonation, a real treat.","Willington, Connecticut, USA","bellco33"

3133,"2017-04-02",4.5,"Bottle split at the Collected Works Tasting #1. The beer of the tasting for me. This is complex, light, refreshing, and a pleasure to drink. Pale color with fizzy but lasting head. Aroma is green apple, rose petals, white wine grapes, light cheese funk, oak, grass, a touch of pineapple. Taste is perfect balanced tartness with light tannic bitterness and mild fruity sweetness. Is it better than the sum of its parts? It depends which batch of which beer but its right up there.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
3133,"2017-03-13",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2017 Golden yellow pour, miniscule head. White wine, oak, citrus dominate the aroma, light vinegar. Citrus, wheat, white wine, oak in the taste, sweet candy notes (lemon drops), tannic, fairly sour. Lower carbonation. Awesome.","","Johnsense"
3133,"2017-03-13",4.5,"375ML. Acquired a few months ago and sat upright since then. Enjoyed at 45F and allowed to warm and breathe for about 10 minutes after opening. Split 3 ways.

A - A very faint golden yellow with no head forming.

S - I just get a heavy dominated Art aroma except a lot more tannic, wine-forward with a candy essence.

T - Yeah, absolutely like drinking a more refined art with wheat, candy, white wine, sour grape, melon.Lemony goodness with a nice solid sour finish but not puckering. Just balanced. I would call it a bitter and softer version of Art.

M - Ultra aging in the barrel means theres not a ton of carbonation until a mouth swish. leaves a fleeting lemon zest flavor.

O - Absolutely fantastic. Would have no issue enjoying 75CLs alone.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
3133,"2017-02-13",4.2,"Bottle. Golden pour with white head. Herbal, wine, floral and tart fruit aromas. Flavors are wine, oak, fruity, and floral notes.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"

3133,"2017-01-30",3.4,"Bottle (dregs)... Murky straw-colored pour with no head. Im not picking up much in the way of an aroma - lemon, oak and maybe some white wine. It could be my nose. Its never been the worlds best. Medium-bodied with adequate carbonation. The flavor is tart and bready. Lemony and fruity. Finishes yeasty and tangy. This is pretty good, but nothing more than that. Refreshing overall. Bottle courtesy of 50belair!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3133,"2017-01-22",4.2,"Youri: Bon, par quoi on commence Yan? Yan: Je sais pas trop... Comme tu veux... Peut-être une petite sour? Bon! Le Chat sort du sac. Aucune mousse, robe vivement claire et animée par une effervescence des plus dynamiques. Ça grouille dans mon verre sur un moyen temps! Une quantité incroyable de vin blanc pétillant et bien minéral, sur un liquide au corps bien sec et fruité. Le baril est exploité à la perfection transportant avec lui un boisé sec, non vanillé et fruité. Des fruits jaunes qui ressemblent à du kumquat, de lécorce de citron, un funk vigoureux. Très bel équilibre entre le fruit et la minéralité. Courte, sèche et vineuse. Ben aimé ça moi cette petite bière dapéro! Est-ce que je paierais 200$ sur le marché secondaire pour boire ça? Pas sûr...","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
3133,"2017-01-04",4.1,"Bottle care of Al, pours a vibrant golden with small head. Notes of plum skins, lemonade, white wine, grape skins, and oak. Lots of plum Flora and Ann complexities in this one. Light to medium bodied. Very tart but not acidic.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3133,"2017-01-04",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2017 Bottle drank onsite. Aroma: white wine, citrus mostly lemons, apples, flowers, barnyard. App: clear golden, minimal white head leaving little lacing. Taste and palate: light body, moderate carbonation, vinous, extremely dry, light to moderate acidity finish. Overall: good stuff, really good BUT Honestly dont think its worth its hype. I really enjoyed the palate though. It was just perfect, so dry like I like them. Good fruity taste as well.","St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Stoned99"
3133,"2016-12-08",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2016 375ml purchased for on site consumption. Pours golden bright yellow. Slight haze with fine carbonated bubbles lasting forever with very decent lacing. Smells winey, champagney. Tart and light fruits such as peach and lemon. Tastes very, very smooth. Delicious fruity tartiness. Almost sour apple flavor. Awesome You can taste the white winey-ness throughout. Great full but light mouthfeel. In mouth taste is as crisp and fulfilling as can be. Nice soft champagne after taste. Wonderful.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Sudz4Dayz"
3133,"2016-11-25",4.4,"Bottle shared with an extremely generous friend. If Hill Farmsteads barrel-aged saisons take on a lot of extra complexity from their time in wine barrels, than this is an even more complex blend of some of their best stuff. Exceptionally smooth, with a bright, clean acidity and cider and white wine flavors. Top notch.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
3133,"2016-11-21",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2017 375 mL bottle. Clear golden. Smells of white wine, a little lemon, faint charred oak. A little bit of wheat. Tastes very lemony. Grainy up front. Strong white wine, but not as strong as the nose. Grain and oak in the back end. Light body. Medium carbonation. It is quite delicious, but doesn?t really distinguish itself from its components, at least in my memory. It?s a little difficult to accumulate the bottles to do a side by side. Update: Had this at a big HF tasting and it definitely stands above some other standout HF beers.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3133,"2016-11-21",4.0,"Bottle. Clear yellow pour with a white head. Sour lemon bouquet. Taste follows suit with some bitterness from the hops in background. Interesting and tasty but maybe not quite worth the hype. Good body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"

3133,"2016-10-19",4.0,"Many, many thanks to tom10101 for sharing! Pours a hazy golden with a thin white head that leaves spotty lacing. Nose is light acetic (unexpected), white wine, oak and light vanillin. Taste is more white wine, moderately tart with good oak and light vinegar again. Moderate body, moderate carbonation a a lightly oily mouthfeel. Ive never had Ann but I get the feeling that each individual components of this blend would shine more on their own. Pretty nice but I had some insanely high expectations, not a good thing I know.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
