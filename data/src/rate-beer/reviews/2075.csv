2075,"2016-11-01",3.5,"Undated 750mL bottle shared by Brian on 10/15/16. Probably a few years old at this point.Still very nicely carbonated with a big, off-white head that is well-retained, topping a cherry-tinted auburn-golden body with good clarity.Oxidation is very apparent in the nose, but its not of the cardboard type. Rather, dates, vanilla, cherries, almonds and such arise having blended with the varied fruity malt notes, caramel and toffee sugars spicy phenols and light earthiness of the yeast. More fruitiness as it warms in the form of apples, cherries and pears, with big vanilla notes from the oxidation. No alcohol or flaw.Fairly sweet in the mouth though the oxidation somewhat works against that. Definitely not underattenuated, though, and malty as many true BdGs are. Big fruity notes, lots of vanilla and medium-dry caramel, with yellow fruits, spicy phenols and earthy, mineral-laden notes from the yeast. Malty texture with strong, but mostly tight carbonation and no alcohol or flaw. Cool, been a long while since I thought of Schlafly and this was a fun one to see. Thanks, Brian.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2075,"2016-09-18",3.4,"750 ml bottle from Artale in Rockford, IL, served at cellar temp in a Duvel glass. Big, fluffy, lasting head leaves chunky lace atop the dusky dark amber body...big expressive nose is cidery/tart, spicy, fairly funky/yeasty, quite potent...on the tongue, also quite cidery and tart, very acidic at the front, with notes of sweet-tart cherries as well, pale malts coming through eventually along with a lactic sourness that is fortunately restrained...finish is relatively drier though the fruitiness never abates, and faintly peppery/alcoholic...moderately full body, aggressive carbonation. Its been a while since Ive had a traditional BDG, so I cant say that Im qualified to suggest whether this is ""true"" to style or not; seems more tart/sour and fruity than I remember being typical.

I love a good Bière de Garde, but they get a bad rap sometimes: theyre sweet, caramel-y, and biscuit in a world that seems to go nuts for whatevers the latest hop bomb. This has a lot of the great malt flavor of a classic BdG, but the yeast added a Belgian Abbey ale flavor and aroma. It surprised me, but not really in a bad way.

Pours cloudy dark orange with an average white head that leaves a thin collar of lace. The nose is pretty strange pumpkin and peanut brittle with a bit of yeast spice.

Hay, lightly floral, faint citrus, and just incredible balance!  Very light body but isnt watery, malt is too well advanced for that.

2075,"2013-08-16",3.5,"No bottling information.
Appearance: The body is a dark amber with poor clarity. The head is dense and rather tall, but dissipates rather quickly into a bubbly light tan coating.
Aroma: The aroma is malty and a bit musky, Im guessing this is old. I am smelling hints of fruitiness, but its hard to discern, perhaps orange and strawberry with a hint of bubblegum. 
Taste: Banana and strawberry are prominent with big malts of caramel and a cereal sweetness. Dried fig is noticed towards the finish with a light peppery spice thats strongest by the finish.
Palate: Medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation.

Mouthfeel- Sour taste at the end of experience with a Medium Bodied base. 

Drinkability- I enjoyed every part of this beer and will be promoting it to other curious drinkers from the iTap house. Now this is my favorite beer from Schlafly!

4.0 A: Hazed medium orange color. Three fingers of pillowy off-white head. Retention is average and a good amount of irregular lacing is left.

4.0 S: Doughy/bready maltiness with a hint of unfermented wort. Toasty with caramel. Quite fruity with peach, apples, and pear. Light apple orchard type funk. Peppery with subtle phenols. Quite pleasant.

4.0 T: Fruitiness is most prominent with apple, pear, peach, and orange in descending intensity. Doughy malts with breadiness coming from the yeast. Again, toasty with light caramel notes. Apple orchard and hay funkiness.

5.0 M: Lighter medium body. Perhaps a touch more carbonation than I would have expected but it works well. Extremely creamy. Perfect here.

2075,"2011-09-27",4.1,"750 ml bottle. Bought at Schlafly in 2007. I think this ones ready! Pours a big fruity ester smell into a Stella glass. Tangy orange beer color, pretty clean looking, and a ring of foam around the edge as remnants of a puffy headed pour. Taste is full of big fruit flavor, a little cider, some pear and a note of plum. Bracketed around this is some green apple tartness and a bit of funk. Yep, a definite thread of a Belgian sour ale in there, and its all for the good. Hops are in the background, as might be expected, and add to the malt ""forward-i-ness"" of the beer. Pouring further from the bottle brings up more haze in the beer, as I stir up the yeast in the bottom. The bottle conditioning gives a nearly champagne like effervescence, albeit at a lower pressure and with less risk of frothing over. I believe I paid $7.50 for this big boy at Schlafly Bottleworks.

An interesting historical French style: basically a cold-aged farmhouse ale which many consider the best balance of clean/rough characteristics. Nice orange color. Medium body. High percentage of alcohol, Though not exactly a fault, Schlaflys example is probably too cleaned-up (likely to appease casual beer drinkers.)

2075,"2011-01-24",3.6,"750ml, 2010 vintage consumed in early 2011.  Pours a clear dark golden to light copper hue with a thick, spongy head of off-white to beige foam.  Ever so slowly, the cap recedes to a thin but lasting film, leaving dense clumps and rings of lacing that cling hard to the glass.  The aroma is nice, displaying a surprisingly spicy profile of wild florals and peppery sandalwood in the foreground, then shifting towards malty dough and toasted nuts glazed with honey.  The spicy notes provide a nice, sharp pop on the nose, cutting through the sweet (but not overly so) malts, which now include lightly toasted marshmallow.  Flavors lean a bit more towards the bready, doughy side of things, as round, fruity yeast starts to throw its weight around.  Still, a persistent, woody spiciness shows through, along with faded floral hops and various other spices.  Trace mineral elements add a surprisingly nice, earthy edge that compliments the floral hopping.  Theres fairly nice balance overall.  The palate also manages to tow the line well, initially whipped and creamy, then sharpening up a bit with focused carbonation before ending just a bit overly sticky for my tastes.  On the whole, Id say this is a very nicely executed American interpretation of a bière de garde.  Back it down to 6% and dry it out just a tad and Id say this would approach top tier status for the genre.  As i stands, its a nice bottle to split two ways amongst friends.  Id gladly try it again.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

2075,"2010-11-12",3.9,"22 ounce exquisitely painted bomber with a  gigantic yeast cake hanging out at the bottom of the bottle.  Poured into my Tank 7 glass.  Full and frothy white head.  Color is a deep copper, darker than I was expecting.  Aroma isnt as strong as I would have hoped, though it is certainly there.  Notes of barnyard are the first thing I notice.  Theres some residual sweetness just under the surface as well.  I get some light cereal notes followed by cherry and white grape.  This is highly carbonated.  The mouthfeel is very bubbly and effervescent, and bubbles go on for days in my glass.  The taste starts off tart (almost mouth puckering so) and then leans towards the sour end of the spectrum.  Again I think of really tart cherries chased by pear juice.  The fruit flavors give way to a  brief bit of grainy maltiness.  Some alcohol is definitely present in the beer, as it is most likely accented by the esters given off by the yeast during fermentation, and as the beer warms these alcohol notes are accented, which can be good or bad depending on your point of view.  This has somewhat of a chewable vitamin finish.  The Biere de Garde style is a cousin to the Saison, one of my favorite styles of beer.  Ive had some very good Saisons, and while this one isnt quite top notch, its not bad, and the flavor profile is certainly in my wheel house.",", Missouri, USA","VengefulOdin"

The flavor was along those same lines.. pale malt, a touch of honey, and some bread at the core and bunches of spice and tartness around in the form of white pepper, floral notes, fruit skins, and vinegar.. tart apricots and some redder fruits carried through the long finish.. as it warmed up, floral bitterness increased on the edges.. great refreshing character was held back a bit by some residual sugars, but it was still tasty.

2075,"2009-05-21",3.5,"Once more I find myself in the position of having just read about a particular beer style and then writing a review about it. The beer in particular is the Biere de Garde from Schlafly. The beer style in question is the French version of the Belgian Saison, or farmhouse ale.


Cloudy tan with rustic hues of old hay and straw while scattered bunches of bubbles lazily skim the surface. No amount of coaxing is going to make this head linger, and why should it when the nose beckons with straight-forward urgency. A quick slap of tart, sour funk leads immediately into grass, bailed hay, crisp straw, leather, and the earthly essence of barnyard dust. I close my eyes and I am in a field of hay, the breeze rustling their pointy tips while in the distance a homely barn can be seen beckoning. Not ready to open my eyes yet, there must be fresh fruit orchards nearby as tart plums, peaches, and tangerines join the breeze. Amidst her resplendent bouquet is an underpinning of brown sugar and nutmeg for a sprinkling of spice. It would be rather dangerous to partake of my Biere de Garde with eyes closed, and so I leave the immediate comfort of her aura to dive deep into her embrace. Clean, clear, and immediately tart with far more sour funk than I initially expected. I wouldnt put her on the level of a lambic or gueze, but a distant cousin maybe. Riding the way of dry sourness are crisp peaches, tangerines, and nectarines, all with a healthy dose of crisp skin. A bite lingers in the back of my throat with citric acidity while nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugars linger long into my breath. Each quaff is deliciously refreshing with a dazzling array of vivid flavors. She grows a bit more earthen further in as some barnyard dust and leather settles into her palate. My glass drained, I close my eyes once more so I may relive for just a while longer the harder yet simpler times where a long day in the fields was relieved by the simple pleasure of a Biere de Garde, chunk of bread, a slab of fresh cheese, and maybe some pickled onions.


Maybe there is a reason why, even now, it is the simplest of pleasures for which we derive the most self-satisfaction. I will take fresh baked bread and decadent cheese with my beer any day, and could enjoy a meal of just those three. While France still holds the key to authentic Biere de Garde, I would be hard-pressed to note many other American craft brewers who were able to accomplish a little bit of French history in a bottle as well as Schlafly has done.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Fresh fruit dominates the nose, with hints of pear, melon, white grape, honeysuckle and other floral touches, mildly peppery spice, and some lightly musty, doughy yeast notes in the background.  Light-medium honeyed amber color with a lasting, rocky, off-white head.  Flavor is tangy and lightly tart, with a certain citric, astringent tone throughout to go along with the faint sweetness, mild bitterness and spice, and a drying, herbal, fruity finish that shows a bit of green apple late.  Fizzy and active on the palate with a medium body.  Interesting take on the style, I suppose, if a bit unexciting.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

In long: Satisfying blend of cereals, juicy citrusy/orangey hops, olives (!!) with a light but noticeable barnyard character.  Body is slim but pleasant, carbonation is smooth.  Overall rather juicy.  Ha, those Americans, always have to prove they can do what the French are good at and take it to the next level.  The French used to eat French Fries, Americans now eat them twice as much.  The French used to make the best Bière de Garde, Americans now make better ones.

2075,"2008-04-07",3.4,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2013 My Bottom Line:
Honest cereals and herbal hops meld into bready yeast in this very drinkable, self-effacing Bière de Garde.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the misty orangey blond.
-Some tangerine-like fruitiness tags along.
-The body is slender and effervescent.
-The overall flavor profile is balanced throughout and rather friendly.

My first Schlafly. A moment Ive been expecting for years. A rather hoppy example, yet with rich, chewy malts underneath. Americanized, but respectful and masterly crafted.


I like:
Beautiful champaigny looks. Tight white head. Fresh cereal nose. Original pumpkin notes. Spicy display without letting varietals being picked out. Fair dose of herbal hops fit perfectly. Full-bodied, but not thick. Expansive carbonation feels authentic. Very engaging from start to finish.

2075,"2008-02-11",3.5,"I live less than two hours from the brewery, but its bombers seldom make it to our stores (the stout and barley wine do). I had to go to Kansas City for this one, over four hours from the brewery. Distribution makes so much sense. And its a pity we dont get this when it comes out because it is a good, light, saison-ish beer. Fruity. Bit of banana. Its the kind of beer folks in Missouri should be making - lets shed the pseudo-lager tradition of A-B and see real European styles. And lets help the folks in the smaller towns out too.

Light to medium-bodied, it has silky-soft carbonation that transitions to a lightly dry and mildly sour finish. The flavor follows the nose with a yeasty, sour farmhouse character to it that is bright and refreshing. This was my first Bière de Garde, and I now feel compelled to seek out others.

2075,"2008-01-02",3.0,"Deep golden orange hues glow in a rich amber body. A medium, frithy head is off-white and quickly receding. Clarity doesnt mesh with preconceived notions of the style at hand. Sweet buttered popcorn brings to light all-too-apparent diacetyl. Beyond that, the aroma is complex and interesting. Caramel is forward and potent, toasted grains fueling the malty fires. Apricot nectar and orange pith are fruity compliments. Peanut brittle is forceful and while pleasing, its a sign of a mismanaged brew. Caramelized brown sugar melts as it leaves the vessel. This is interesting though I dont find it terribly appetizing. Diacetyl is lessened in the flavor as caramel and multiple fruits create a sweet network with a backdrop of tanginess. Acidity is nil, astringency from fruity acids low. The finish is muted, off-dry and caramelly. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated, smooth and lightly sticky. Average, flawed to a notable degree that detracts from enjoyment at all stages of consumption.

A good looking start, cloudy orangey hued tarnished copper with a frothy off-white, creme colored head, good retention, small rings of laced sticking at the top of the glass.

Light whiffs of earthy must, clove and herbal spice, followed by a tart orange and pineapple fruitiness. Estery alcohol and toasted sweet malts at the edges.

Well rounded feel in the palate, airy, creamy moderate body along with a slickness that covers the tongue. Nice spicy flavor in the beginning, earthy must, clove, anise and herbs. Mildly tart fruits, orange, pineapple and banana. A good backbone from the toasted malts, nutty grains with light touches of sweet caramel. In the end, a herbal hop spiciness becomes more pronounced, helping to provide a nice dry finish. The alcohol is barely noticeable, just a nutty, fruity low grade warmth in the mouth.

Lively, fresh taste, I was very impressed by this Bière de Garde, another top notch beer from Schlafly. This is currently on-tap at the Taproom and the Bottleworks, plus 750 ml. bottles are available all over the St. Louis area.
