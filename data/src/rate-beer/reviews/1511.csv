1511,"2017-06-15",3.9,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a clear gold with a medium sized white head. Soft citrus, musk, wheat on the nose. Medium bodied, soft sweetness, wheat, a bit of orange dances through some floral notes with wheat, and even some crisp citrus hoppiness. Very cool things going on here, bordering on that greenness that I dont like, but it lurks in the back and mostly turns to mango and tropical fruit notes. Slow crisp bitterness, super easy drinking. Light, pretty, lovely.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

Fruity aroma mostly (peach, melon, kiwi, etc.) with some wheat and spice notes and a bit of cracker too. Flavor is fruity and hoppy, the wheat and spice come through on the close. Really nice beer.

1511,"2016-07-22",4.5,"Bottle from Meditrina. Very pale slightly hazy gold with lasting head and lace. Dank hop aroma with lemon and mint and wheat tang. Mild pineapple apricot grassy sweetness with light fresh fruit tang and very dry spicy finish. Light body and lively carbo. So refreshing and delicious in this heat. I was worried because I usually hate ""wheat ale"" but this is wheat ale that tastes like very dry tropical IPA. FUCKING NAILED IT!","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
1511,"2016-07-21",3.3,"Bottled 6/26/16, drunk 7/9/16.A light cloudiness shows throughout this flaxen-gold beer. White head is medium-sized, rocky and fairly persistent.Very dry, wheat-tinged biscuit and cracker malts are joined by the house yeast character (earth, ash, light pepper perhaps) while lemony hops perk up. Some soft marmalade character is added, with a touch of grapefruit pith and minimal pine. Patience is rewarded with softer, lightly juicy citrus emerging with warming, as well as a touch of honey-tinged vanilla-like maltiness. No flaw or alcohol.Buttery up front, its at least a dry diacetyl character and becomes more popcorn-like and less savory butter-like. The palate mostly accustoms to it and the delicate hops add citrus and moderate bitterness to overcome. Tight carbonation, dry and with a slick-to-wheaty texture overall. Could use a bit more softness and juiciness, but I guess thats not what theyre going for here. Oh ya, and lose the diacetyl....","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1511,"2016-07-17",3.8,"Pours a medium golden color with three fingers of white foam. Typical hop forward MBC offering with layers of melon, citrus, hints of tropical notes and some well structured malt. FIzzy carbonation mingles nicely with the fruity wheat and carries the hop flavors to the forefront of the palate. Dry aggressive finish with bitter earthy hop notes lingering. Tasty especially if it were 10.99 a six pack but at $7.49 a bottle I dont think I would ever buy it again...","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
1511,"2016-07-11",3.8,"500ml bottle in a teku. Pours light golden with a white head. Aroma of citrusy and resinous and lightly fruity hops, some pale malts and wheat, and light dough. Flavor the same with a nice hoppiness. Average texture. A solid beer.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
1511,"2016-07-10",4.2,"This was poured into an English pub glass.
The appearance was a glossy burnt yellow color with a thin white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Thin lacing returns to the edge of the glass.
The smell starts off with some light wheat/grassiness/somewhat like hay. Then some light sweet melon returns within and slides in and around a light spice somewhat like black pepper. Fresh return of that ""water-nutrient"" enriched citrusy tones.
The flavor takes all of the previously mentioned flavors and brings it all together with a sweet hop oily residue sliding over my taste buds. Nicely restrained sweet wheaty/melon/berry/citrus aftertaste with a quick sweet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a nice sly oily sesssionable feel to it. Im thinking MBC used their house yeast to assist in allowing the whet to be fairly tame in this one.
Overall, definitely a wonderful APWA made by a stellar company. I would love to have this again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
