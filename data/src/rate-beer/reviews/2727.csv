2727,"2017-01-27",3.1,"Pours a light straw color. About three fingers eggshell colored head . Reduces to about one finger head. Good lacing. Pretty good retention.Aroma is pilsneresque. Floral and earthy hops. Light coriander, light pepper. Light yeast. Cracker.Taste is malty, but not too sweet. Reminds me of Red Stripe. Light lemon, light alcohol. Crackery. Some herbal hops add some bitterness, or is it the alcohol?Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Quite dry. Finishes a little harsh and awkward. A little oily and hoo bitter, I think.Overall, its drinkable. Not sure where theyre going with this. Nah, I wouldnt recommend this, and I wouldnt buy it again. Its as good enough to swallow, but nothing more.","Arkansas, USA","beer_rookie"

2727,"2016-11-17",3.7,"12 oz. bottle via trade. Pours a just barely cloudy bright gold with a small white head that settles into a ring, as well as a few small islands of films and stray ropes of lace. Big pils malts, bready and crackery and a little biscuity, with straw, grassy Noble hops, with a bit of floral bitterness and some grainy dustiness. Light-plus bodied, with moderate carbonation and a malty, smooth, slightly sweet and bitter mouthfeel. Really nice, pleasant beer. Nice new annual offering from Schlafly.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

2727,"2016-10-24",3.8,"12 oz. bottle from Liquor Barn (Jefferson Commons); bottled on 9/8/16. Aroma: Herbal lemon loaf; really has a malt character reminiscent of a Helles, but the hops are more in line with a German Pils. Appearance: Transparent yellow gold body with healthy carbonation holding up a foamy white head that settles into a patchy skin. Flavor: More herbal up front with bready malts coming in more midway through; lemony hop notes become more prevalent at the same time, and lead to a lightly bitter/off dry finish. Palate: Medium body, sticky texture, average carbonation, bitter finish. Overall: Im a fan. Has all the features youd expect from a clean, characterful German interpretation of the style.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"

2727,"2016-10-18",3.4,"A very good lager. Pour is hazy and straw color with a medium white head that sticks to glass. Aroma is clean and just a touch of hops present. The thing that stands out most for me with this beer is the creaminess most lagers are just water down and this has great mouth feel.","Maryland, USA","bigguns22"
2727,"2016-10-01",3.0,"Pour is a hazy golden with a large white head. Aroma is some sweet grassy malt with a decent hop perfume. Flavor is more of a neutral grain with a surprising amount of bitterness. Finish is clean and refreshing. A little bit sweeter than I like but this was a flavorful hoppy lager.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"

Gentle is a good description for this. A hint of tropical varietied fruit. Something like Juicy Fruit gum and light tartness. Tasty and pleasant.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"

2727,"2016-09-09",3.7,"It pours clear golden with a white head. The aroma has grassy hops, spice, rounded lager and caramel. It has a medium body thats almost oily and has very light carbonation.
